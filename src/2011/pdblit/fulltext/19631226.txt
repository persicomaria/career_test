Biotechnology Research Institute, 6100 Royalmount Ave., Montreal Quebec Canada H4P 2R2 and Montreal Joint Center for Structural Biology, Montreal Quebec, Canada The biosynthesis of histidine is a central metabolic process in organisms ranging from bacteria to yeast and plants. The seventh step in the synthesis of histidine within eubacteria is carried out by a pyridoxal-5H -phosphate (PLP)-dependent L-histidinol phosphate aminotransferase (HisC, EC 2.6.1.9). Here, we report the crystal structure of L-histidinol phosphate aminotransferase from Escherichia coli, as a complex with pyridoxamineÊ 5H -phosphate (PMP) at 1.5 A resolution, as the internal aldimine with PLP, and in a covalent, tetrahedral complex consisting of PLP and L-histiÊ dinol phosphate attached to Lys214, both at 2.2 A resolution. This covalent complex resembles, in structural terms, the gem-diamine intermediate that is formed transiently during conversion of the internal to external aldimine. HisC is a dimeric enzyme with a mass of approximately 80 kDa. Like most PLP-dependent enzymes, each HisC monomer consists of two domains, a larger PLP-binding domain having an a/b/a topology, and a smaller domain. An N-terminal arm contributes to the dimerization of the two monomers. The PLP-binding domain of HisC shows weak sequence similarity, but signi®cant structural similarity with the PLPbinding domains of a number of PLP-dependent enzymes. Residues that interact with the PLP cofactor, including Tyr55, Asn157, Asp184, Tyr187, Ser213, Lys214 and Arg222, are conserved in the family of aspartate, tyrosine and histidinol phosphate aminotransferases. The imidazole ring of L-histidinol phosphate is bound, in part, through a hydrogen bond with Tyr110, a residue that is substituted by Phe in the broad substrate speci®c HisC enzymes from Zymomonas mobilis and Bacillus subtilis. Comparison of the structures of the HisC internal aldimine, the PMP complex and the HisC L-histidinol phosphate complex reveal minimal changes in protein or ligand structure. Proton transfer, required for conversion of the gem-diamine to the external aldimine, does not appear to be limited by the distance between substrate and lysine amino groups. We propose that the tetrahedral complex has resulted from non-productive binding of L-histidinol phosphate soaked into the HisC crystals, resulting in its inability to be converted to the external aldimine at the HisC active site.

Crystal Structure of E. coli HisC

Introduction
Histidine biosynthesis is among the most thoroughly studied anabolic pathways, and its study in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli has provided a wealth of general information on mechanisms of metabolic regulation.1 Comparative sequence analysis of the genes from this pathway from a variety of organisms suggests that it is an ancient metabolic route that existed prior to diversi®cation of the Bacteria, Archaea and Eucarya.2,3 Histidine biosynthesis is also intimately connected with the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides through the formation of 5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide ribonucleotide, a product of the reaction catalyzed by imidazoleglycerol phosphate synthase. In eubacteria, histidine is synthesized through a complex biosynthetic pathway involving eight enzymes and nine chemical intermediates, starting from ribose-5-phosphate and ATP.1,4 Three of these enzymes, HisB, HisD and HisI, are bifunctional1 and one is a heterodimer, being composed of the hisH and hisF gene products.5 The structure of HisC is the third three-dimensional structure of an enzyme from the histidine biosynthesis pathway, following the recently reported structures of HisF (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1THF) and HisA (PDB code 1QO2), both from Thermotoga maritima.6 In eubacteria, including E. coli and S. typhimurium, histidinol phosphate aminotransferase (HisC, imidazole acetol-phosphate transaminase, EC 2.6.1.9) catalyzes the seventh step in the pathway, the transfer of the amino group from glutamate to imidazoleacetol phosphate to yield L-histidinol phosphate and a-ketoglutarate (Figure 1). Through this reaction, glutamate ultimately contributes the a-amino moiety found in L-histidine. HisC from E. coli belongs to family I of the aminotransferase superfamily.7 Analysis of sequences for members of this superfamily, including aspartate, histidinol and tyrosine aminotransferases, indicates that these proteins are evolutionarily related, with several residues associated with dimerization or catalysis and substrate-binding being conserved.7,8 Like all transamination reactions, that catalyzed by HisC is pyridoxal-5H -phosphate (PLP)-dependent. The residue forming the Schiff-base with PLP in E. coli HisC is Lys214. The corresponding residue in HisC from S. typhimurium, Lys217, has been identi®ed by sequencing the reduced, carboxymethylated peptide following digestion of the protein with trypsin.9 Comparison of the protein sequences for HisC from eubacteria, such as E. coli,10 with those from yeast11 and plants such as Nicotiana tabacum12 reveals that these enzymes share about 30 % overall sequence identity. Like many other PLP-dependent enzymes, HisC from eubacteria are dimeric enzymes, with each monomer having an approximate mass of 40 kDa.13 The most thoroughly studied HisC at the biochemical level

is that from S. typhimurium,9,13 ± 17 which shares 87 % amino acid sequence identity with the E. coli enzyme. HisC exhibits a ping-pong bi-bi (double displacement) kinetic mechanism9,14,15,18 and appears to have partially overlapping substrate-binding sites, corresponding to the forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by the enzyme.9 Puri®ed HisC from Bacillus subtilis19 and Zymomonas mobilis18 have broad substrate speci®cities, with the latter enzyme able to transaminate tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine in addition to histidinol phosphate. The enzyme from S. typhimurium can also utilize L-histidine as a substrate, although with a much higher Km than for L-histidinol phosphate.14 Several crystal structures for either the internal aldimine between PLP and enzyme or external aldimine between PLP and substrate have been obtained for a variety of PLP-dependent enzymes catalyzing reactions with amino acid substrates (reviewed by Metha & Christen,3 Jansonius20 and John21). Nucleophilic attack of the substrate amino group on the internal aldimine results in formation of a transient, tetrahedral species called the geminal diamine (gem-diamine). While the gem-diamine intermediate has not been observed structurally, it has been inferred based on stopped-¯ow kinetics,22,23 detected spectroscopically,22,24 and structures for it proposed based on modeling.25,26 Here, we present the crystal structures of HisC from E. coli containing pyridoxamine-5H -phosphate (PMP), its PLP internal aldimine, as well as a tetrahedral complex with both PLP and L-histidinol phosphate covalently linked through the active-site residue Lys214. This covalent complex represents the structure of the gem-diamine intermediate. To our knowledge, this is the ®rst report of the structure of such a complex for a PLP-dependent enzyme.

763 total of seven a-helices. This central b-sheet consists of six parallel b-strands, having the order 1-76-5-4-2-3, with only strand b7 being anti-parallel to the rest. The small domain consists of a fourstranded antiparallel b-sheet, with the order of the b-strands being 1-2-4-3, and three a-helices. One face of this b-sheet packs against the loops connecting b-strands of the central b-sheet on the C-terminal end of the PLP-binding domain, while the second face packs against the three, externally arranged a-helices (Figure 2(a)). The b-sheets of the small and large domains are essentially perpendicular to one another. Dimer structure HisC is a homodimer in solution (Mr  60 kDa) as determined by dynamic light-scattering. This result is consistent with previous observations for HisC puri®ed from S. typhimurium13 and Z. mobilis.18 A dimeric arrangement is observed in the crystal structure, with the dimer having Ê Ê Ê approximate dimensions of 94 A Â 55 A Â 54 A (Figure 2(b)). In the crystal structure of HisC, the two monomers of the dimer are related by a 2-fold crystallographic axis parallel to the b-axis. The minimum catalytically competent structure for nearly all PLP-dependent enzymes appears to be that of a dimer, even for those cases where subunits associate to form tetramers or hexamers.20 For HisC, as well as for other PLP-dependent enzymes, dimer formation is essential in forming a functional active site.3 The N-terminal residues Arg3 to Lys19 form an extended ``arm'' that interacts with the PLP-binding domain of the opposite monomer (Figure 2(b)). As well, residues Leu47-Cys58, part of a long loop covering the PLP-binding domain of each monomer, extends towards, and makes contacts with, the other molecule of the dimer. Much of the remaining dimer interface is comprised of four a-helices and their connecting loops adjacent to the

Results and Discussion
Quality of the models The structure of recombinant SeMet HisC from E. coli in the PMP form was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method from synchrotron data and re®ned to a ®nal R-facÊ tor of 0.205 (Rfree  0.219) at 1.5 A resolution. The structure of the internal aldimine form of HisC Ê was re®ned at 2.2 A resolution, to an R-factor of 0.213 (Rfree  0.257). Data for the covalent complex of PLP and L-histidinol phosphate bound to Ê Lys214-NZ of HisC were collected also to 2.2 A resolution, and re®ned to an R-factor of 0.202 (Rfree  0.221). Each of the models has been re®ned with good stereochemical parameters (Table 1). Of the three cis-proline residues found in each monomer (Pro108, Pro155 and Pro158) two of these, Pro108 and Pro158, are conserved in the family of aspartate, tyrosine and histidinol phosphate aminotransferases.8 Statistics for the Ramachandran plot from an analysis using PROCHECK27 for the three models gave 88 % of non-glycine residues in the most-favored region, with only Arg24 and Leu26 in the generously allowed regions. These residues belong to a less well-ordered polypeptide segment (residues 21-29) observed in each of the models. Monomer structure Each HisC monomer consists of an N-terminal arm (residues Thr3-Arg19) and two domains, a larger PLP-binding domain (residues Thr41-Gln259) and a small domain (residues Tyr20-Pro40 and Gln260-Val356) (Figure 2(a)). The interdomain interactions within each monomer are maintained by the presence of 32 hydrogen bonds and many hydrophobic interactions. The PLP-binding domain possesses an a/b/a architecture, with a sevenstranded mixed b-sheet ¯anked on both sides by a

N-terminal side of the b-sheet of the PLP-binding domain from each monomer. The solvent-exposed surface area buried upon formation of the dimer, Ê Ê calculated using a 1.4 A probe, is 2760 A2, or approximately 20 % of the total surface area of each monomer. In HisC, the close contacts between the monomers are maintained by a total of 52 Ê hydrogen bonds (<3.1 A), including 12 salt-bridges and extensive hydrophobic interactions. Of these intermolecular interactions, six hydrogen bonds, including one salt-bridge, are contributed by residues from the ``arm'' region of each monomer.

Sequence and structural homology HisC proteins from eubacteria, the archae, yeast and plants form a conserved group of enzymes (Figure 3). Using BLAST,28 the sequence identities between E. coli HisC and the most homologous member of each group are: 87 % (S. typhimurium; NCBI g47723), 32 % (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicus; NCBI g2622710), 34 % (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; NCBI g6322075) and 32 % (Aradopsis thaliana; NCBI g6978917). The most conserved portions of these sequences, based on a comparison with sequences for family I aminotransferases, are

766 those expected to be located at the dimer interface, as well as within the active-site region.7,18 A search for topologically similar proteins within the PDB was performed with the program DALI.29 Signi®cant structural similarity was found between the PLP-binding domain of HisC and the corresponding domain from several PLP-dependent enzymes. These structural similarities corresponded to similarities in protein sequence based on a BLAST search of protein sequences from the PDB. The highest structural similarity is observed between HisC and the PLP-binding domain of Thermus thermophilus aspartate aminotransferase,30 Ê yielding an rmsd of 2.1 A for 222 Ca atoms, with 24 % identity. This is followed by tyrosine Ê aminotransferase31 (rmsd  2.5 A for 222 Ca atoms; 21 % identity), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate Ê synthase32 (rmsd  2.5 A for 227 Ca atoms; 21 % Ê identity) and E. coli MalY protein33 (rmsd  2.5 A for 224 Ca atoms; 19 % identity). In addition, the recently determined structure of 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase34 (PDB 1FC4) is structurally Ê related, giving an rmsd of 3.3 A for 199 Ca atoms. These observations are consistent with an evolutionarily conserved structure for the PLP-binding domain in family I aminotransferases, while at the same time the amino acid sequence of this domain has diverged for members within the biochemically specialized subdivisions of the family.3,7 Comparison to other PLP-dependent enzymes extends the structural similarity to the small domain as well. Superposition of the small domain of HisC with the corresponding domain 2-amino-3ketobutyrate CoA ligase (PDB 1FC4) gave an rmsd Ê of 2.7 A for 102 Ca atoms, while that with tyrosine aminotransferase (PDB 1BW0) resulted in an rmsd Ê of 2.8 A for 119 Ca atoms. While in several cases the individual domains of HisC and other PLP-dependent enzymes super-

pose well, the relative disposition of the two domains often varies. This is illustrated in a superposition of the structures of E. coli HisC and T. thermophilus aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), based on their PLP-binding domains (Figure 4). Notable exceptions in structural similarity are the absence in HisC of two a-helices, corresponding approximately to residues Ser22-Gly28 and Val43-Thr48, that are present in the AspAT, as well as most of the homologous structures listed previously. In addition, the ®rst b-strand of the antiparallel b-sheet of the small domain is not found in the AspAT structure, resulting in a threestranded rather than four-stranded b-sheet. It is notable that all of these differences in structure are localized to the small domain of the two enzymes. Active site PLP-binding site Although no PLP was added to the enzyme during puri®cation or crystallization, two molecules of cofactor, one for each monomer, were identi®ed in the initial electron density maps calculated from synchrotron data. These molecules are non-covalently bound to the enzyme, with the amino group of the active-site lysine residue, Ê Lys214-NZ, 3.1 A from C4A (also referred to as C4H ,35) of the cofactor (Figure 5(a)). This lack of a covalent bond to Lys214 suggested that the cofactor was PMP rather than PLP. In turn, this led us to compare electron density maps calculated from data collected in-house from either a native HisC crystal, or SeMet-substituted crystal with that from the synchrotron experiments. In contrast to the structure determined from synchrotron data, crystals of HisC measured in-house showed the presence of PLP as the internal aldimine (Figure 5(b)).

This superposition was calculated based on Ca atoms from the PLPbinding domains of both enzymes, corresponding to residues Thr41-Pro259 of HisC, and Arg54-Glu283 of AspAT (PDB 1BJW30) using the program O.50

In each case, the electron density is contoured at a Ê Ê level of 2.0s.

Spectra recorded for puri®ed HisC protein in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), showed a distinctive peak at 327 nm, with no peak corresponding

to the internal aldimine (427 nm). Titration with a-ketoglutarate shifted the absorption maximum for HisC from 327 nm to 427 nm, concomitant

768 with the appearance of a distinct yellow color for the sample (Figure 6). Above an a-ketoglutarate concentration of 15 mM, a distinct shift in the 327 nm peak to 338 nm was observed. We interpret these results as indicating the puri®ed HisC sample was primarily in the PMP form (327 nm), and was converted to the internal aldimine absorbing at both 338 nm and 427 nm upon addition of a-ketoglutarate. The absorption peak at 338 nm is consistent with the enolimine form of the internal aldimine.36 There is a time-dependent as well as chemicaldependent conversion of the PMP form of HisC to the internal aldimine upon storage at 4  C (Figure 6). Under the conditions used in our experiments, we have noticed the HisC protein sample to be initially colorless following puri®cation, consistent with the PMP form, followed by the sample becoming yellow over several weeks. Therefore, the observation of either PMP or the internal aldimine in our crystals is likely related to these observed differences upon storage of the sample. Each HisC monomer contains most of the residues necessary to form a single active site. One hydrogen bond, between PLP and Tyr55B (where B refers to the other monomer), as well as several van der Waals contacts, are made with the corresponding molecule of the dimer. Each of the PLP molecules resides within a cavity on the monomer surface, and is buried completely within the dimer interface, explaining why they co-puri®ed with the enzyme. The distance between the phosphoryl moieties of the two bound PLP molecules is Ê 22.6 A. Each PLP-binding site is formed mainly by residues from the central seven-stranded b-sheet, and a-helices that pack against one face of this sheet (Figure 2(a)). Side-chains, which form hydrogenbonding interactions with PLP, come mainly from

the C-terminal ends of b-strands of this b-sheet, as well as from loops connecting these b-strands. Key residues are found on b-strands 5 (Asp184) and 6 (Thr211) or loops (Asn157, Tyr187, and Ser213). Tyr55B is found on a long loop of one monomer that extends towards the active site of the opposite monomer. Analysis of the electrostatic potential of the PLP-binding site using the program GRASP37 showed that the binding pocket for the pyridoxal ring is negatively charged. There are also distinctive positive patches corresponding to the PLP phosphate-binding site (Arg222) and the two Arg residues that bind the phosphoryl group of L-histidinol phosphate (Arg322 and Arg335). Hydrogen bonds are made between the pyridinium ring and the side-chains of the conserved residues Asn157, Asp184 and Tyr187 (Figure 7). An additional interaction is aromatic stacking between Tyr110 and the pyridine ring of PLP with Ê a separation of 3.5 A. The N1 atom of PLP is hydrogen bonded to Asp184-OD2, a residue absolutely conserved in the aminotransferase superfamily.7 This interaction contributes to ®xing the PLP cofactor in its correct position, with little effect on enhancing the ability of the pyridine ring to act as an ``electron sink''.38 The PLP molecule is anchored through its phosphate moiety, which makes several hydrogen bonds with the enzyme (Figure 7). The most important of these interactions is with Arg222, which forms a salt-bridge to two oxygen atoms of the phosphoryl moiety. Additional H-bonds are between Thr211-OD1 and O2P, Tyr55B-OH and O3P and Ser213-OG and O3P. As well, the mainchain nitrogen atoms of Ala84 and Asp85 hydrogen bond with the phosphoryl oxygen atoms of PLP. The positive end of the dipole of an a-helix (residues Gly83-Phe95) contributes to the stabilization of the negative charge on the phosphoryl group of PLP. A glycine residue, Gly83, caps the N-terminal end of this a-helix, and is absolutely required at this position in family I aminotransferases.7 It is possible that this N-terminal cap ensures the correct positioning of the ahelix, or that Gly83 is required to prevent a steric clash between the side-chain and the phosphoryl group of PLP. The PLP-binding site of HisC is structurally similar to that found in other PLP-dependent enzymes, including those of T. thermophilus aspartate aminotransferase,30 E. coli MalY protein,33 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase32 and Trypanasoma cruzi tyrosine aminotransferase.31 The key residues that make polar contacts between the enzyme and PLP, Tyr55B, Asn157, Asp184, Tyr187, Lys214 and Arg222 are conserved in family I aminotransferases7 and superpose well between HisC and the structurally related PLP-dependent enzymes.

769 (external aldimine, Figure 920,21). This conversion proceeds through a gem-diamine intermediate, in which the C4A atom of PLP is tetrahedrally bound to the amino group of the substrate, as well as to the NZ atom of the active-site lysine residue. While there is evidence from both modeling25,26 and spectroscopy22,24,39 for the presence of this intermediate, it has not been characterized structurally. Soaking crystals of HisC in 4 mM L-histidinol phosphate resulted in formation of a tetrahedral species that structurally resembles the gem-diamine (Figure 5(c)). Continuous electron density between the C4A atom of PLP and Lys214-NZ, as well as between C4A of PLP and the nitrogen atom of L-histidinol phosphate, in both the initial difference electron density map (not shown) and simulated annealing omit map based on the ®nal model (Figure 5(c)) are consistent with the gem-diamine structure. While other possibilities for interpretation of the electron density were considered, such as the ketimine, or a Michaelis complex involving PLP and L-histidinol phosphate, these species would not possess a covalent bond to Lys214-NZ. The reasons for the observation in these crystals of a species thought of as being transient are not clear. One possibility is that restrictions in protein movement imposed by crystal contacts contributed to trapping of this species. The covalent complex shows a high degree of structural similarity with the HisC internal aldimine. Superposition of Ca atoms for the two structures shows there are no large movements of protein atoms. However, comparing the C5 atoms of PLP for the HisC-LPH complex and the internal aldimine indicates the PLP ring has rotated approximately 20  (Figure 8), the value predicted in proceeding from the internal aldimine to the Ê gem-diamine.25,26 This is accompanied by a $1.0 A movement of Lys214-NZ in proceeding from the internal aldimine to the covalent complex. This lack of conformational change in the protein is unusual compared to that observed for some aminotransferases, where substrate binding induces closure of the large and small domains.21 As described previously, this may be due to the constraints imposed by crystal contacts, as the complex was obtained by soaking rather than by cocrystallization with L-histidinol phosphate. It has been proposed that in fact two gem-diamine intermediate species exist that differ in the position of the proton. The ®rst such intermediate (Figure 9, species II) has the proton localized to the amino acid substrate, and the second (species III) to the lysine residue.24,40 Two events should occur in order to proceed from the gem-diamine intermediate to the external aldimine.26 First, it is necessary that a proton transfer occurs from the substrate amino group to the NZ atom of the active-site Lys214. Secondly, rotation of the PLP ring should occur, such that the C4A-Lys214-NZ aldimine bond is perpendicular to the plane of the PLP ring.

phosphate-binding site

L-Histidinol phosphate (LHP) is buried within a pocket at the dimer interface, with the imidazole ring being closest to the protein surface. The LHP molecule appears to have wedged its way into its binding site while minimizing main chain or sidechain movements. The binding site is close to the segment Gln21-Asn29 of the small domain, a region that appears only partially ordered in electron density maps, and which therefore is probably ¯exible. Three side-chain hydrogen bonds are observed between HisC and L-histidinol phosphate, between Tyr110-OH and LHP-NE2, Tyr20-OH and LHPNE2, as well as Asp85-OD2 and LHP-ND1. Both Tyr20 and Asp85 are essentially conserved in the alignment of HisC sequences (Figure 3). Interestingly, the third residue, Tyr110, is conserved in some HisC sequences, but not in those from Z. mobilis or Bacillus subtilis, where it is replaced by a Phe (Figure 3). This change from Tyr to Phe may help to explain the broader substrate speci®city for aromatic amino acids with these latter two enzymes.18,19 The phosphoryl group of LHP is anchored through hydrogen bonds between oxygen atoms of the ligand and Tyr20-OH, Asn157-ND2, Arg322 and Arg335. The residues Arg322 and Arg335 appear to be of primary importance, with Arg335 interacting in a bi-dentate manner (Figure 7(c)). Despite these interactions, the phosphoryl moiety appears to be less-well ordered, as re¯ected by temperature factors for these atoms of about Ê Ê 43.4 A2, compared to 20.9 A2 for all other atoms in the PLP and L-histidinol phosphate ligands. The location of the phosphoryl group is consistent with the observation that a phosphate anion binds at precisely this location in the T. thermophilus AspAT structure.30 A superposition of the three different structures revealed minimal movements of protein sidechains or ligand atoms, as depicted in Figure 8. Comparison of the internal aldimine and PMP forms of HisC reveals a movement for Lys214-NZ Ê of about 1 A. Careful inspection of the electron density for the atoms C5-C5A-O4P-P linking the pyridinium ring to the phosphoryl group of PLP indicated two possible conformations, with the larÊ gest movement being 1.3 A for the C5A atom. The internal aldimine appears to have preferentially adopted one of these conformations, compared to the models with PMP or PLP-L-histidinol phosphate (Figure 8).

Covalent complex between HisC and L-histidinol phosphate It is well established that the initial steps in the reaction mechanism of PLP-dependent enzymes involve the conversion of the Schiff base between the active-site lysine residue and PLP (internal aldimine) to that between PLP and the substrate

In the HisC-LPH structure, the distance between Ê the two amino groups (2.4 A) suggests that this proton transfer is possible. As well, there is no hydrogen bonding interaction between the substrate nitrogen atom and any protein residue that would prevent such a transfer. In the structure of the complex, the angle between the C4A-Lys214NZ aldimine bond and the PLP ring is 116  , suggesting that a further rotation of approximately 26  is necessary to achieve the geometry required to proceed to the external aldimine. It is possible that the inability of the HisC-LPH complex to convert to the external aldimine is the result of a steric restraint that prohibits the required rotation of the PLP ring within the active site.

is expected to exist transiently in solution, we suggest that our ability to observe the covalent complex in the crystalline state is a consequence of crystal packing forces that prevent movements in the enzyme that would allow conversion to the external aldimine, as expected in solution.

Materials and Methods
Cloning and expression of the E. coli hisC gene The hisC gene was ampli®ed by PCR using recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham-Pharmacia). Genomic DNA from the E. coli strain MC1061 (F À araD139 Á(ara-leu)7696 galE15 galK16 Á[lac]X74 rpsL [Strr] hsdR2 [rkÀ mk] mcrA mcrB1) was used as template. Oligonucleotide primers (Hukabel Scienti®que Â Ltd., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) had sequences 5H -CCTTAAGGAGCACATATGAGCACCG-3H and 5H -TTCGCTAATCAGGGATCCATCGCGA-3H , respectively. Cloning of the PCR-derived amplicon was performed into a derivative of the pGEX-4T1 vector (AmershamPharmacia) in order to obtain an in-frame fusion with Schistosoma japonicum glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and a thrombin cleavage site. Plasmid DNA was prepared, which was then transformed into the protein

Conclusions
We present here the crystal structure of E. coli HisC as its PMP form, as the internal aldimine with PLP, and as a covalent complex with PLP and L-histidinol phosphate that resembles the expected structure for the gem-diamine. As the gem-diamine

expression strain BL21 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA USA) or for selenomethionine protein production, the E. coli methionine auxotroph DL41.41 Purification of HisC Native HisC protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 in LB medium using the same expression and puri®cation procedure as described in the following for the SeMetsubstituted protein. For preparation of selenomethioninesubstituted HisC, a 100 ml overnight culture grown in LeMaster medium41 at 37  C was inoculated into 1 l of the same medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin (Sigma) and grown with shaking at 37  C for two hours. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG (Sigma, St. Louis), and then the culture was incubated overnight at room temperature with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 g, 4  C, 20 minutes) and resuspensed in 40 ml of buffer A (50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 % (w/v) glycerol, 20 mM DTT and one tablet of Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada)) and lysed by sonication (30 seconds on, followed by 30 seconds off, ®ve cycles, 4  C). The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (150,000 g, 4  C, 45

minutes). The protein supernatant was passed through a DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column to remove highly anionic material and then loaded onto a 5-ml column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) equlibrated in buffer A. After loading, the column was ®rst washed with ®ve to ten column volumes of buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, 5 % (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 % (v/v) Triton X-100), followed by washing with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 M NaCl, 5 % (w/v) glycerol) until no further protein was eluted as determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad42). Full-length HisC protein including three additional residues, Gly-Ser-His, resulting from the engineered thrombin cleavage site, was obtained by incubating the fusion protein while bound to glutathione Sepharose at 22  C for 75 minutes with 80-100 mg of human alpha thrombin (Haematologic Technologies Inc.). The eluate from the cleavage step containing HisC protein was collected from the column, and the column washed further with two column volumes of buffer. Protein purity was assessed by SDSPAGE and native PAGE.

Hydrogen Ê bonds between HisC and the ligands (less than or equal to 3.2 A) are indicated by broken lines. These Figures were prepared using the program LIGPLOT.56

UV-visible spectrophotometry UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Cary 3E UVvisible spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Australia). Spectra were analyzed using the Cary WinUV software. All spectra were recorded at 22  C using quartz cuvettes with a 1 cm path-length. The reference cell contained all components of the buffer, minus the protein. Puri®ed native HisC protein in the PMP form (300 ml; 1 mg/ml (12.7 mM)) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8), was titrated with aliquots of a-ketoglutarate (free acid, Sigma), with ®nal concentrations ranging from 5 mM to 1 mM, and spectra recorded between 260 nm and 540 nm after each aliquot was added and mixed. Crystallization of HisC Puri®ed native HisC was concentrated to approximately 8 mg/ml in a buffer consisting of 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA. Initial crystallization screening was performed using the sparse matrix

approach43 using kits from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA). The protein was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The best crystals appeared when equilibrating against reservoir solution containing 22.5 % (w/v) PEG 3350, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mM MgCl2 and 7 % (w/v) glycerol. In order to obtain bigger crystals, macroseeding was employed. Crystals grew to a ®nal size of approximately 0.25 mm Â 0.25 mm Â 0.3 mm in two weeks. Both native and Se-Met-substituted crystals grew under essentially the same conditions. Crystals belong to the space group C2 with Z  4. Unit cell dimensions for the PMP-bound Ê Ê form of SeMet HisC were a  132.2 A, b  62.6 A, Ê , b  104.1  . Native crystals containing the c  45.3 A PLP internal aldimine or SeMet HisC crystals containing the covalent complex with PLP and L-histidinol phosphate were isomorphous to SeMet HisC PMP crystals, Ê Ê and had unit cell dimensions of a  132.5 A, b  62.4 A, Ê and b  104.3  . c  45.5 A

Key hydrogen bonds between HisC and the covalent complex are shown with broken lines.

Data collection, structure solution and refinement Crystals of SeMet HisC were soaked brie¯y (one minute) in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of mother liquor supplemented with 15 % (w/v) glycerol, picked up in a nylon loop, and frozen at 100 K in a N2 (gas) cold stream (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). Synchrotron data were measured at beamline X8C, NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory. X-ray ¯uorescence spectra recorded near the Se absorption edge were analyzed with the program CHOOCH44 to determine the correct energies for measurement of anomalous and dispersive differences. Complete MAD datasets were collected at three wavelengths (Table 2) and collected using a Quantum 4 CCD detector. Diffraction data were processed using the programs Denzo and Scalepack.45 For phase Ê Ê determination, the resolution range from 12 A to 1.7 A was chosen. Three of four expected Se sites for each HisC monomer were found using the program SOLVE.46

The resulting phases gave an overall ®gure of merit (FOM) of 0.68. Further improvement in the phases was achieved by density modi®cation using the program DM47 from the CCP4 suite,48 resulting in an increase of the overall FOM to 0.77. The starting electron density map was of good quality and the program wARP49 was used to automatically build the HisC model, resulting in 45 % of the total model being traced as polyalanine. Remaining parts of the model were built manually using the program O.50 Electron density maps showed the presence of a molecule of cofactor non-covalently bound in the vicinity of Lys214. The lack of a covalent bond to Lys214, a participant in the Schiff base, suggested that the cofactor was in the form of PMP rather than PLP. Further cycles of model building alternating with re®nement using the program CNS51 resulted in the ®nal model, with an Rfactor of 0.205 (Rfree  0.219). No s cutoff was used

during re®nement. Final re®nement statistics are given in Table 1. The ®nal model for each monomer comprises 354 residues, one PMP molecule and 224 water molecules, with the ®rst well-ordered residue in each monomer being Thr3. Three residues prior to the N-terminal Met1 of the protein, resulting from the engineered thrombin cleavage site, as well as Met1 and Ser2 did not have interpretable density and were not modeled. Additionally, residues Gln21 to Asn29 of the small domain are poorly de®ned in the electron density. A total of nine side-chains, mainly in the region Gln21 to Asn29, were modeled as Ala due to the absence of clear density. HisC-PLP internal aldimine Following determination of the HisC crystal structure, diffraction data for a native HisC crystal was collected in-house using an R-axis IIC imaging plate with an RU300 rotating anode generator as the X-ray source. Crystals were cryo-protected as described above. Native HisC puri®ed protein was crystallized under the same conditions as described above for the SeMet HisC. The re®ned HisC structure determined from SeMet MAD phasing, with cofactor removed, was used as the starting model for re®nement, and the model re®ned using CNS to a ®nal R-factor of 0.213 (Rfree  0.257) with good geometry (Table 1). No s cutoff was used during re®nement. Analysis of difference and simulated annealing Ê omit electron density maps calculated at 2.2 A resolution clearly revealed the presence of the cofactor covalently bound to Lys214-NZ, indicative of the HisC-PLP internal aldimine. There are 130 solvent molecules included in this model. Subsequent analysis of a dataset collected on SeMet-substituted HisC crystals grown at 4  C, instead of 22  C, also revealed the internal aldimine. HisC PLP, L-histidinol phosphate covalent complex The covalent complex between PLP, L-histidinol phosphate and Lys214-NZ of HisC was obtained by soaking crystals of SeMet-substituted HisC in 4 mM L-histidinol phosphate for seven days at 18  C. A complete dataset to Ê 2.2 A resolution was collected on an R-axis IIC area detector from a single frozen crystal (Table 2). Crystals were cryo-protected as described above. The HisC model was used to calculate the difference electron density maps that revealed the presence of the complex. This model was re®ned with CNS, combined with manual re®tting with the program O.50 The model for this complex, consisting of residues Thr3-Val356, has 14 residues modeled as Ala due to the absence of clear side-chain density. The ®nal model has an R-factor of 0.202

(Rfree  0.221), with good geometry (Table 1). No s cutoff was used during re®nement. PDB accession codes Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank52 for HisC bound to PMP (1FG7), the HisC-PLP internal aldimine (1IJI) and HisC covalently bound to PLP and L-histidinol phosphate (1FG3), respectively.
