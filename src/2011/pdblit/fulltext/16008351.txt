ABSTRACT: Archaeal ribosomal protein L7Ae is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that recognizes the K-turn motif in ribosomal, box H/ACA, and box C/D sRNAs. The crystal structure of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii L7Ae has been determined to 1.45 Å, and L7Ae's amino acid composition, evolutionary conservation, functional characteristics, and structural details have been analyzed. Comparison of the L7Ae structure to those of a number of related proteins with diverse functions has revealed significant structural homology which suggests that this protein fold is an ancient RNA-binding motif. Notably, the free M. jannaschii L7Ae structure is essentially identical to that with RNA bound, suggesting that RNA binding occurs through an induced-fit interaction. Circular dichroism experiments show that box C/D and C/D RNA motifs undergo conformational changes when magnesium or the L7Ae protein is added, corroborating the induced-fit model for L7Ae-box C/D RNA interactions.

The most prevalent nucleotide modifications of ribosomal RNA are the methylation of ribose 2-hydroxyl moieties and the isomerization of uridines to pseudouridines. Although their biological significance is unclear, most of these modifications are relegated to distinct functional regions and thus suggest an important role in ribosome function (1-9). Failure to properly modify rRNA can impair the efficiency of protein synthesis (6, 7). In eukaryotic cells, the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)1 guide the 2-O-methylation of approximately 100 nucleotides and the pseudouridylation of a similar number of nucleotides (10). The mechanisms specifying the target sites for RNA modification are remarkably similar between Archaea and Eucarya (11-13). Comparable snoRNA-like RNAs (sRNA) also guide the 2-Omethylation and pseudouridylation of RNA in Archaea. It appears that in both kingdoms strong evolutionary pressure has maintained the function of these guide RNAs, which likely have common and thus ancient origins prior to the

divergence of eukaryotes and archaea, some 2 billion years ago (1, 3, 9, 12, 14). Modification of ribosomal and other RNAs is directed by small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) that consist of a guide RNA bound by a set of RNP core proteins. The box C/D family of guide RNAs specifically targets 2O-methylation of both eukaryotic and archaeal RNAs (8, 12, 15-18). Box C/D RNAs possess C and D box sequences located near their 5- and 3-termini, respectively, and often contain sequence-related C and D boxes located internally (Figure 1) (16, 19-23). The C/D and C/D boxes are short, conserved nucleotide sequences that fold to form specific core protein-recognition sites. Regions that guide methylation are positioned upstream of boxes D and D and are complementary to the target RNA(s) where modification occurs. The target nucleotide of the snoRNA-target duplex positioned five nucleotides upstream of box D or D is the substrate nucleotide for 2-O-methylation (24, 25). The box C/D core motif is positioned at the termini of most box C/D RNAs and situates the conserved C and D motifs in proximity for base pairing and core protein binding. Recent studies have shown that box C/D motifs adopt a folded RNA structure, termed the "kink-turn" or "K-turn" (Figure 1) (23, 26). In the resulting helix-loop-helix motif, the internal loop is always asymmetric and typically has three unpaired nucleotides on one strand and none on the other. The resulting helix-loop-helix motif exhibits a sharp turn that bends the RNA helices at an 65° angle. Critical for K-turn formation are two tandemly sheared G,A base pairs that hydrogen bond across the asymmetric loop (26). For most known K-turns, the first helical stem ends with two Watson-Crick base pairs (typically C,G pairs), and the second helical stem starts with the two sheared G,A base pairs stacked on stem II. The sheared G,A base pairs are

Suryadi et al. enable cells to coordinate rRNA processing with ribosome assembly (9, 14, 23, 42). Remarkably, archaeal L7Ae interacts with both box C/D and C/D, whereas the 15.5kD/ Snu13p protein apparently interacts with only box C/D. Since the L7Ae RNA-binding motif was originally identified (44), this protein fold has surfaced in a number of diverse RNA-related functions. L7Ae has notable sequence and structural similarity with eukaryotic 15.5kD/Snu13p, Nhp2p, L7a, L30, S12, and possibly other proteins, such as the selenocysteine insertion sequence binding protein, SBP2 (33, 45). Several groups have studied the 15.5kD, archaeal L7Ae proteins (26, 30, 35, 36, 46, 47), and the structurally similar ribosomal L30 proteins (27, 48-52), but primarily as RNAbound protein complexes. We were interested in examining the structure of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mj) L7Ae in the absence of RNA and comparing and contrasting it to the RNA-bound form (35) and other homologues. Here, we present a detailed structural analysis of Mj L7Ae and biophysical evidence that it stabilizes box C/D K-turn motifs through an induced-fit mechanism that only slightly alters the protein's conformation.

FIGURE 1: M. jannaschii sR8. The C/D (blue) and C/D (red) box motifs are shown in bold colors, and the guide regions complementary to the target RNAs are indicated. The nucleotide complementary to the methylation target is boxed. Note that the box C/D and C/D motifs have similar sequences but form different structures. Box C/D has no stem I but rather a five- or sixnucleotide loop.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification. The Mj L7Ae gene was cloned from Mj genomic DNA (ATCC) via PCR and ligated into the pET28a plasmid (Novagen) as described by Tran and colleagues (42). This vector system produces an N-terminal His6-tagged protein that can be cleaved by thrombin, leaving only three vector-encoded amino acids before the wild-type methionine. The L7Ae protein was overexpressed in the Rosetta(DE3) pLysS cell line in LB medium by IPTG induction (Novagen). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a French press, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 25000g. Afterward, the recombinant L7Ae was purified from the cleared lysate by nickel affinity chromatography as suggested by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Peak fractions were pooled and treated with thrombin to cleave the His6 tag, and the mixture was dialyzed extensively against 20 mM Tris,HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF (Q-anion exchange buffer). The resulting solution was further purified by FPLC anion exchange chromatography with a RESOURCE-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Following extensive washing, a linear NaCl concentration gradient from 20 mM to 1 M in Q-anion exchange buffer was used to elute the protein. This step primarily serves to remove contaminating nucleic acids. The purified L7Ae protein was then dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES,KOH (pH 7.5) and 20 mM NaCl and concentrated with centrifugal filters. Purified stock solutions of L7Ae were filtered, dispensed as 1 mL aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -20 °C (the L7Ae protein is quite susceptible to crystallization when stored at 4 °C under low-salt conditions). Yields were typically 3540 mg of purified L7Ae protein per liter of Escherichia coli culture. RNA Purification. RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO) and were deprotected according to the manufacturer's instructions (53). RNAs were dialyzed against Q-anion exchange buffer and purified using FPLC anion exchange chromatography with a RESOURCE-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). A linear NaCl concentra-

characteristic of this motif and are essential for tertiary folding. Examples of this conserved RNA motif have been identified in structures of the Haloarcula marismortui and Thermus thermophilus ribosomal subunits, archaeal and eukaryotic box C/D RNAs, archaeal box H/ACA RNAs, eukaryotic snRNAs, bacterial antitermination sequences, and recently a group I intron (26-37). Divalent cations, particularly Mg2+, have been shown to stabilize K-turn motifs in solution (38, 39). Cations are presumably also involved in protein-K-turn RNA interactions, although definitive identification has proven to be elusive. Four calcium ions were observed in an L7Ae-box H/ACA-duplex complex structure, yet they interacted with a bulged region of the duplex, and not directly with the K-turn motif (35). The exact structure of the internal box C/D motif has yet to be determined. It has box C- and D-related sequences, yet typically includes RNA loops in place of stem I. We propose that the box C/D motif folds into a structure similar to, but distinct from, box C/D. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration that the core proteins differentially recognize the box C/D and C/D motifs. In eukaryotes, 15.5kD and Nop58-fibrillarin core proteins bind the box C/D RNA region, while the Nop56-fibrillarin dimer binds the C/D motif. In archaea, L7Ae, Nop56/58, and fibrillarin collectively bind to both box C/D and C/D motifs (40-42). The sRNA motifs are thought to undergo a conformational change upon protein binding (30, 42, 43). Because they are differentially recognized by core proteins, the box C/D and C/D motifs must have different RNA secondary structures (40-42). The L7Ae protein (15.5kD/ Snu13p homologue) is particularly interesting, functioning as a ribosomal protein and as both a box C/D and box H/ACA core protein (34). This finding indicates that L7Ae plays at least three roles in archaeal organisms and may

Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mM HEPES,KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. The RNAs were then denatured at 65 °C, slowly cooled to 4 °C under dilute conditions (<1 µM) to prevent hairpin dimerization, concentrated, filtered, and stored at -20 °C. Crystallization. Samples of L7Ae protein [1 mM  13 mg/mL in 10 mM HEPES,KOH (pH 7.5) and 20 mM NaCl] were screened for crystallization conditions by the hangingdrop vapor-diffusion technique using several commercial sparse-matrix screens (Hampton Research). Typically, 3 µL of an L7Ae protein solution was mixed with 1 or 2 µL of crystallization solution on a siliconized coverslip, inverted, and placed over 1 mL of crystallization solution in VDX crystallization plates (Hampton Research) sealed with Corning Release Compound. A number of long needles appeared in several conditions after approximately 3 days. While conditions were being optimized, a large single crystal (0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.7 mm) was observed 12 days after the initial screening in condition 41 of Hampton Research's Crystal Screen I (100 mM HEPES,NaOH, pH 7.5 buffer containing 10% 2-propanol and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000). Due to its striking size and quality, this crystal was selected for X-ray analysis without further optimization. Data collection, processing, structure determination, and refinement of this initial low-resolution structure (1.86 Å) are described in the Supporting Information; the details of the subsequent high-resolution structure (1.45 Å) are reported below. Other lead conditions were iteratively optimized to produce well-diffracting crystals with cryoprotectant qualities. Final crystallization conditions for high-resolution data collection were obtained by mixing 2 µL of 1 mM L7Ae with 1 µL of 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mM HEPES,KOH (pH 7.5), 10% 2-propanol, and 5% ethylene glycol. Crystals were apparent after 1 day as long, intermeshed needles and reached their maximum size after 3-5 days. Data Collection and Processing. A single crystal was harvested from the mother liquor with a nylon loop, mounted on a goniometer, and flash-frozen in a liquid N2 vapor stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline X26c (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) at a wavelength of 0.900 Å using an ADSC Quantum 4 detector with a crystal-todetector distance of 120 mm. Images were collected as 20 s exposures in 1° oscillations; 180 images with 146 021 reflections were colleted in the resolution range of 27.631.45 Å. Data were indexed and scaled using HKL 2000 (54), resulting in 21 176 unique reflections (19 072 above 1). Data reduction statistics and unit cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement. The structure of L7Ae was determined by the molecular replacement method with EPMR (55) using the lower-resolution Mj L7Ae structure as the search model. The solution of this structure is described in the Supporting Information. One solution was straightforwardly identified with a correlation coefficient of 0.713. Refinement was initially carried out using CNS with 5% of the data excluded for the Rfree calculation (56). Rigid body refinement of the molecular replacement solution

produced a model with an Rcryst of 32.03% and an Rfree of 33.38% in the 27-1.5 Å resolution range. One round of simulated annealing significantly improved the model (Rcryst ) 28.15%; Rfree ) 29.68%), and manual fitting was initiated using XtalView (57). Cross-validated, sigma-Aweighted composite omit maps or sigma-A-weighted 2Fo - Fc, 5Fo - 3Fc, and Fo - Fc maps calculated in CNS were used for fitting and model building. Density modification, implemented in CNS, was also used to reduce model bias and improve maps. Approximately 20 iterations of manual fitting and refinement in the resolution range of 271.5 Å were performed, yielding a model with an Rcryst of 18.61% and an Rfree of 21.32% (Table 1 in the Supporting Information). High-Resolution Refinement. High-resolution refinement was carried out with REFMAC5 (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) (58, 59). Ten cycles of translation, libration, and screw-rotation (TLS) refinement, combined with four cycles of individual atomic refinement, were performed on the L7Ae protein and a 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfate (HEPES) buffer molecule located in the solvent region near H60. Subsequently, eight cycles of restrained refinement with isotropic B-factors were carried out. Riding hydrogens were added to the protein model, and 10 additional cycles of restrained refinement were performed. Finally, individual anisotropic B-factors were refined, including contributions from riding hydrogens (six cycles), which produced a model with an Rcryst of 13.53% and an Rfree of 19.30% (Table 2). Refinement progress is summarized in Table 1 in the Supporting Information. The final model was analyzed using SFCHECK, PROCHECK, and MolProbity (58, 60-62), and statistics are given in Table 2. Structural and Sequence Analyses. The Mj L7Ae secondary structure was assigned using DSSP (63), and intermolecular interactions, solvent accessibility, and molecular volume were analyzed using the CCP4 programs CONTACT, NCONT, ACT, SURFACE, and VOLUME (58). Hydrogen bonding was analyzed with HBPLUS (64). Isotropic temperature factors were examined using MOLEMAN (65), and anisotropic displacement factors were analyzed with Parvati (66).

Suryadi et al. Circular Dichroism Experiments. Wavelength experiments were carried out by monitoring the ellipticity in 1 nm steps from 200 to 350 nm using an Aviv 215 spectrometer. Typically, samples were prepared in 20 mM Na2HPO4 or sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) and 20 mM NaCl (1 mL volumes) in 0.2 or 0.5 cm quartz cuvettes at 25 °C. L7Ae and RNA concentrations were 5 µM, unless otherwise specified. Circular dichroism thermal denaturation experiments were carried out by first collecting a wavelength spectrum at 25 °C. The sample was then cooled to 2 °C and slowly heated from 2 to 110 °C in 2 °C steps, while the ellipticity was monitored at 222 nm. After the temperature was held constant at 110 °C for 2 min, the sample was recooled to 2 °C in 2 °C increments while the ellipticity was monitored at 222 nm. Finally, the sample was returned to 25 °C, and a wavelength spectrum was collected. These last two steps tested the reversibility of the thermal denaturation. The heating and cooling rates were 20 °C/min, with 0.5 min equilibrations at each temperature. After temperature equilibration, ellipticity data were collected for a 10 s period. Melting experiments were performed in triplicate, and the ellipticity values at each temperature were averaged. The melting temperature (Tm) and the van't Hoff enthalpy of denaturation (HvH) were determined from a plot of the averaged ellipticity at 222 nm versus temperature (in kelvin). The melting curve was fit to a six-variable equation (assuming a two-state transition) implemented in ORIGIN 7.0 (Microcal) (75, 76). Urea and guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn,HCl) denaturation experiments were carried out by preparing individual samples containing 5 µM L7Ae in 10 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) buffer containing 20 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and the desired concentration of denaturant. Denaturants were made fresh on the day of experimentation, and concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 M for urea and from 0 to 6 M for Gdn, HCl. Samples were equilibrated at 25 °C for at least 30 min before spectra were acquired in the 200-350 nm range. Experiments were performed in duplicate, and the ellipticity values were averaged at each denaturant concentration. A plot of the averaged ellipticity at 222 nm versus denaturant concentration was constructed, and the free energy of denaturation (GD) was obtained by fitting the curve with an equilibrium two-state denaturation model using ORIGIN 7.0 (77).

Structure of a Multifunctional L7Ae RNA-Binding Protein

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 28, 2005 9661 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION L7Ae Structure Determination. To evaluate the differences in the structure of free L7Ae versus RNA-bound protein and to gain insight into the structure basis of L7Ae's broader RNA specificity versus the eukaryotic 15.5kD protein homologue, we crystallized and determined the structure of Mj L7Ae. Data were collected at beamline X26c at the National Synchrotron Light Source using a single crystal (Table 1). The structure was determined using the molecular replacement method based on a lower-resolution structure (see the Supporting Information for a complete description). Refinement was initially performed with CNS (56), and then REFMAC5 was used to refine anisotropic B-factors and riding hydrogens (59, 78). The final model was refined to a resolution of 1.45 Å, yielding exceptional crystallographic statistics and stereochemical parameters (Table 2). Quality of the Structural Model. The recombinant Mj L7Ae protein contains 120 amino acids, including three N-terminal plasmid-encoded amino acids (G-S-H...) that remain after thrombin cleavage of the His6 tag. The final crystallographic model contains 118 residues, beginning with His -1 and continuing to the wild-type C-terminal residue, Gln118. Electron density was observed for virtually all of the wildtype protein residues, but was not apparent for the vectorencoded Gly -2 and Ser -3, indicating that they were disordered in the crystallographic lattice. A fully traceable density envelope was apparent at the beginning of refinement but during the latter stages of refinement became striking, fully encompassing virtually every amino acid and water, even at 3-4 contouring (Figure 2). Alternative conformations were modeled for 13 residues (K6, Q25, N32, E39, R40, I47, K53, E55, E56, V57, I70, E103, and E104), and a HEPES buffer molecule, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1ethanesulfonate, apparent in the solvent region near H60 and Y63, was included in refinement. The final model contains 1859 non-hydrogen protein atoms and 173 water molecules. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot showed that 99 of 106 amino acids, which were not glycine, proline, or terminal residues, were in the most favored regions of the plot (93.4%) and seven residues (6.6%) were in additionally allowed regions (Table 2). Average isotropic displacement (B) factors were 18.5 Å2, with 12.8 Å2 for the peptide backbone, 18.8 Å2 for side chains, and 33.6 Å2 for solvent molecules (Figure 1 in the Supporting Information). Analysis of anisotropic displacement factors (Uij) was accomplished using PARVATI (66). Protein atoms had mean anisotropic factors of 0.618 ( 0.137 and 0.483 ( 0.137 for solvent atoms. This protein structure was determined and refined at the highest resolution among L7Ae homologues or structurally related proteins, to date, permitting detailed analyses of intermolecular contacts and interactions with solvent molecules or ions. We have been able to thoroughly analyze the effects of RNA binding on the protein structure and compare it with the RNA-bound form (35), other homologues (26, 30, 36, 46, 47), and structurally related proteins (27, 50, 52). Structure Description. The L7Ae tertiary structure consists of an R- -R sandwich fold with alternating R-helices and -sheets separated by coiled regions (Figure 3A). Helices R1, R4, and R5 are parallel to one another and orthogonal to the roughly parallel R2, R3, and 310 helices on the opposite

On one side of the structure, helices R1, R4, and R5 are roughly parallel to each other but are approximately perpendicular to the R2, 310, and R3 helices on the opposite side.

on the structure of the box C/D and C/D RNA motifs. RNA samples (5 µM in 1 mL) were equilibrated in 10 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) and 20 or 150 mM NaCl. Aliquots of MgCl2 or L7Ae (1 µL additions of varied concentrations) were added stepwise to the RNA sample; the solution was mixed by inversion, and a CD spectrum in the 350-200 nm region was acquired after a 10 min equilibration at 25 °C. This procedure was repeated until the desired titrant concentration was achieved, usually in fewer than eight additions. The volume and concentrations of the initial RNA samples were prepared so that the final sample volume at the conclusion of the titration was 1.0 mL and the protein and RNA concentrations were both 5 µM (e.g., 995 µL of RNA solution and 5 µL of L7Ae). Dilution of the initial RNA concentration by the titrant was kept below 1% in all experiments (i.e., <10 µL of titrant was added to the initial RNA sample).

9662 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 28, 2005 side of the globular domain (Figure 3A,B). The central core of the R- -R sandwich is composed of three parallel -strands ( 1- 3) and one antiparallel -strand ( 4) topologically spaced between the 1 and 2 strands; together, these four -strands form a -sheet, with 1 approximately 120° out of plane compared to 3 (Figure 5A). In the Mj L7Ae structure, there are two type I turns (A2-V5 and A49-V52), two type IV turns (A43-V46 and V52-E55), and four type VIII turns (V3-I6, A24-I27, I96-E99, and E99-A102). The N-terminus contains a 10-residue coiled region containing two turns (loop 1). It lies perpendicular to the central -sheet axis and forms a hydrophobic barrier on this side of the protein. A second prominent six-residue coiled region (loop 9) extends from the distal end of R4 to the proximal end of 4. It forms a distinct cradle for interacting with K-turn RNA motifs and is buttressed from below by hydrophobic contacts from R4. Residues in loop 9 are thought to be responsible for establishing the RNA binding specificity of the L7Ae family of proteins (35). All of the L7Ae R-helices are amphipathic, with hydrophobic residues extending inward toward the core with a considerable number of acidic and basic residues exposed on the solvent faces. Three -strands ( 2- 4) comprise the hydrophobic core and, not surprisingly, contain almost entirely hydrophobic or nonpolar residues. However, the 1 strand lies on the periphery of the hydrophobic core and roughly alternates between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. All of the hydrophilic 1 residues are lysine and extend toward the RNA-binding interface. On the opposite side of the protein, loop 1 makes a hydrogen-bonded turn and a loose bend, buttressing Y4 against the core side of the 310 helix. It then forms a perpendicular brace against 3 before ending with P10 at the proximal end of R1. A striking feature of loop 1 is that F7 forms a three-residue aromatic trefoil with Y72 and Y74 of 3, effectively sealing off the hydrophobic core on this side of the domain (Figure 2). It is interesting that four of the five aromatic residues in L7Ae are involved in interactions with or by loop 1. The number of aromatic residues in the L7Ae family is highly conserved, and most homologues have four or five aromatic residues, typically in the same tertiary region as Mj L7Ae. In the archaeal L7Ae homologues, tyrosine is the predominant aromatic residue, but phenylalanine is most common in eukaryotes. Mj L7Ae contains approximately 151 hydrogen bond donor moieties and 176 hydrogen bond acceptor groups. The secondary structural elements of L7Ae are involved in approximately 150 intraprotein hydrogen bonding interactions; the majority of these (i.e., 77) are Oi f H-Nj interactions common in -sheets, and the second greatest class (40) is made up of Oi f H-Ni+4 interactions, typical of R-helices. The remainder of the hydrogen bonds are in parallel bridges (5), antiparallel bridges (11), and Oi f H-Ni+3 (11) or Oi f H-Ni+5 (3) helical interactions. Approximately 140 hydrogen bonds are made with water molecules surrounding the protein, and in most of these cases (101), the protein is the hydrogen bond acceptor. The solvent shell surrounding the L7Ae protein (173 waters) is involved in at least 186 H2O-H2O hydrogen bonding interactions. Mj L7Ae contains nine ion pairs between lysine and glutamate or aspartate residues within 3.6 Å of each other. Seven of these salt bridges are tertiary interactions. They

Suryadi et al. interlink the secondary structural elements to each other and stabilize the tertiary structure (K6B-E66, K23-E104, K44E99, K53-E55, K68-E39, K78-D51, and K111-E16). The other two are intrahelical and involve residues one turn around an R-helix from one another. One such ion pair exists in R1 between K15 and D19, and the other is found in R2 between E33 and K36. When the range of ionic interactions is extended out to 6 Å, the number of potential ion pairs doubles (total of 18), and at an 8 Å radius, there are at least eight additional interactions, for a total of 26 ion pairs (79). Of 36 charged residues in Mj L7Ae (19 acidic and 17 basic), only six are not involved in some type of ion pair interaction (K26, K29, E56, E67, E88, and E110). Of these six, three are highly conserved (K29, E56, and E67) and four are involved in intermolecular interactions. K26, K29, and E88 contact RNA, and E56 is possibly involved in interactions with ribosomal protein L15, based on similar interactions seen with Hm L7Ae in the 50S ribosome subunit (Figure 4) (46). Ostensibly, ionic interactions are important for maintaining L7Ae's stability at Mj's high growth temperature and interaction with L7Ae's binding partners. Overall, 3474 intramolecular contacts are within 3.6 Å of each other in the L7Ae structure, emphasizing the compact and extremely stable globular domain. The Mj L7Ae protein is composed primarily of nonpolar amino acids (68), including five aromatic residues. However, the protein has 49 polar amino acids with 19 acidic and 17 basic residues (Figure 4). The calculated isoelectric point is 5.59, and the protein is estimated to have a charge of -2 at ¨ pH 7.0, based on the naive assumption that all residues have pKa values equivalent to the individual amino acids. Mj L7Ae has 55 hydrophobic amino acids that are offset by 44 hydrophilic and 18 neutral residues. The structural hydrophobic core is comprised of 51 residues, 23 of which are completely buried, and the rest are partially exposed (Figure 4). Of the hydrophobic core residues, 11 are neutral amino acids and two are hydrophilic. L7Ae's solvent-exposed surface consists of 66 residues, seven of which are neutral amino acids and 17 hydrophobic. The surprising number of hydrophobic surface residues (25%) may indicate regions that are involved in hydrophobic interactions with other proteins. Proteins from thermophilic organisms typically minimize exposure of nonpolar residues and increase the number of charged surface residues as a means of augmenting thermal stability (79). The solvent-exposed surface area of Mj L7Ae is 6450.7 Å2, and the molecular volume is 17 437.1 Å3, providing a surface area:volume ratio of 0.37 Å-1. The molecular density is 1.55 g/cm3. One small internal cavity of approximately 2.6 Å3 exists between the distal end of R1 and the proximal end of R5 and is lined by A20, K23, E99, G100, D101, E104, and L105. Collectively, these results indicate that Mj L7Ae is tightly packed, and this may facilitate a number of favorable van der Waals interactions and contribute to its thermal stability. Mj L7Ae's surface is punctuated with charged residues, particularly lysines and glutamates (Figure 5B). The electrostatic potential calculated by Delphi is 11 217.8 kcal/mol (46 966.77 kJ/mol or 18 942.93 kT) with a solvation energy of -1275.46 kcal/mol (-5340.09 kJ/mol or -2153.80 kT) (Figure 5C). At least 20 surface amino acids have been identified on Mj L7Ae or homologous proteins that contact RNA. They contact RNA either directly or through hydrogen

bonding and water-mediated interactions (Figure 4) (30, 35, 36, 47). RNA-contacting residues are relegated to three distinct regions: the 1-loop 3-R2 region (K26, K28, K29, G30, A31, N32, E33, K36, and R40), the loop 5-310 helix region (V52, K53, P54, and V57), and loop 9 (L87, E88, V89, A90, A91, and S92). Residues that contact RNA or are involved in secondary structural features of the binding region form a roughly 20 Å × 25 Å area on one side of the protein. K78, which makes specific contacts with the extruded uridine of typical K-turn RNAs (35), is located at the proximal end of R4 and protrudes toward the binding site. A significant band of positive electrostatic potential exists around the RNA-binding interface and is likely responsible for attracting RNA targets toward the binding site (Figure 5C). At least eight basic residues are involved in this focus of positive potential, including K26, K28, K29, K36, K44, K68, R40, and H60. On the opposite side of Mj L7Ae, there is a diagonal swatch of negative surface potential containing E11, E12, E16, D19, D80, D101, E103, and E104. This region is likely involved in electrostatic interactions with its protein binding partners. Analysis of the Mj L7Ae sequence classifies it as a member of Pfam 01246 (ribosomal L7Ae, L30e, S12, Gadd45 family), COG 1358 (ribosomal protein HS6 type [S12, L30, L7a]), and COG 1911 (ribosomal protein L30).

ClustalW sequence alignments performed with similar proteins obtained from BLAST searches indicated that there are 19 residues that are phylogenically conserved (Figure 4; Figure 3 in the Supporting Information) (68). Of these 19 amino acids, four are universally conserved (G30, K36, P54, and G82), 13 are strongly conserved (I27, N32, E33, V38, R40, I48, A49, D51, V57, L61, E67, L81, and I96), and two are semiconserved (G41 and C65). Note that two of the highly conserved resides are located in critical loop regions and are essential components of the protein fold (G30, loop 3; P54, loop 5). Lysine 36 is part of R2, forms a salt bridge with E33, is involved in RNA interactions, and thus has likely been conserved due to its RNA binding capacity. Glycine 82 exists in R4 directly under loop 9 and is perhaps conserved for steric reasons. ConSurf analysis of the Mj L7Ae structure was also performed. This method maps conserved residues onto the three-dimensional structure through an integrated PSIBLAST search, ClustalW alignment, and position-based scoring using Bayesian or maximum likelihood algorithms. ConSurf identified 51 highly conserved residues (grades 9-7; 9:11; 8:21; 7:19), 35 with average conservation, and 31 variable residues (Figure 4A). Most of the highly conserved residues identified in the ClustalW alignment were also identified by ConSurf (18 of 19) with the exception of I27,

which was classified as having an average level of conservation. ConSurf classified as highly conserved most of the residues which have been shown to be involved in RNA interactions at the distal end of 1 and loop 3 (K29, G30, A31, N32, and E33), as well as R40, K78, and residues in the loop 5-310 helix region (V52, P54, and V57). However, the proximal end of 1, K53 in loop 5, and most of the RNAcontacting residues in loop 9 were classified as having average (K53, L87, A90, A91, and S92) or variable levels of conservation (K26, K28, and E88); the exception was V89, which was classified as highly conserved. This finding is interesting because a phylogenic trend has been observed in the loop 9 region of L7Ae homologues, where archaeal L7Aes have the consensus sequence A-G-L/I-X-V-X-A-A, and many eukaryotic L7Ae orthologs have the C-G-V-S-RP-V-I sequence. Upon examination of the sequences, it appears that more variation exists in this region with the protist homologues (i.e., Trypanosoma, Plasmodium, Euglena, Giardia, etc.) (Figure 4B and Figure 3 in the Supporting Information). This region of loop 9 contacts the K-turn RNA motif and is likely the basis of RNA target specificity (35). Comparison of the Free and RNA-Bound Mj L7Ae Structures. The Mj L7Ae structure experiences minimal conformational changes when binding RNA. Comparison of the free structure of M. jannaschii L7Ae to that bound to a K-turn motif from an archaeal box H/ACA-like RNA (35) revealed that the overall structure does not significantly change when it interacts with RNA (Figure 6). Several groups had alluded to this possibility in studies of homologous L7Ae proteins, but this study is the first structural comparison of the bound and free forms of the same L7Ae protein (35, 36, 47). The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between 115 CR atoms in residues 2-116 is 0.355 Å (Table 2 in the

Supporting Information); the rmsd is 0.346 Å for all backbone atoms (456 atoms), and for all the atoms in 115 residues (825 atoms), the rmsd is 0.835 Å. Clearly, these structures are extremely similar. However, some differences appear in specific amino acid residues, particularly those involved in RNA interactions: 19 have rms deviations greater than 1 Å, and 21 have rmsd values between 0.5 and 0.7 Å (Table 3, Figure 4, and Figure 2 in the Supporting Information). Most are found in four distinct regions, two of which are key RNA binding sites: R1, the 1-loop 3-R2 region, the loop 5-310 region, and the loop 10-R5 region. We were most interested in the conformational changes occurring upon RNA binding, so we focused on these residues. Of the 20 residues that contact RNA or are involved in hydrogen bonding or water-mediated interactions with RNA, at least 12 have differences with rms deviation values greater than 0.8 Å between the two Mj L7Ae structures (K26, K29, G30, A31, N32, E33, K36, R40, K53, P54, V57, and K78; Table 3, Figures 4 and 6, and Figure 2 in the Supporting Information). The most notable conformational differences are observed for E33, R40, P54, and V57. Smaller structural changes were noted with K26, N32, and K36, where the side chain direction is consistent in both structures, but the side chains have alternative conformations or rotamers. In the free Mj L7Ae structure, E33 is parallel to the R2 helix axis and participates in a salt bridge with K36. However, in the L7Ae-box H/ACA RNA complex, E33 reorients toward loop 9 and establishes hydrogen bonding interactions with the RNA (Figure 6). This 120° conformational change was also noted by Charon and colleagues in the free Pa L7Ae structure compared to the 15.5kD-U4 snRNA and Hm L7Ae-23S rRNA structures (26, 30, 47). We see the same conformation of E38 in the structure of the free A. pernix L7Ae (J. Suryadi and B. A. Brown, II, manuscript in preparation), indicating that reorientation of this glutamate residue occurs upon RNA binding. Initially, in the free protein, E33 forms a salt bridge with K36, but upon RNA binding, E33 apparently reorients and both E33 and K36 establish hydrogen bonding interactions with the

9666 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 28, 2005 RNA. Note that E33 and K36 are highly conserved amino acids and are probably both essential for productive RNA interactions. The R40 A conformer also differed between the bound and free Mj L7Ae structures (Figure 6 and Table 3). In the free Mj L7Ae structure, R40 juts out of the distal end of the R2 helix and points away from the RNA-binding interface, parallel with the R1 and R5 helices. The C, C, and C atoms form a 120° angle, bending the arginine 65° upward from the position typically observed in other L7Ae homologues. Arginine 40 was truncated at C in the L7Ae-box H/ACA complex, presumably due to disorder (35). We were able to model the general direction of this side chain based on the C trajectory, and this positioning is consistent with all of the other homologous structures, including the unbound L7Ae structures from Pa and Ap (47). In the Mj L7Ae-box H/ACA RNA complex, R40 faces outward toward the RNA and participates in electrostatic interactions with the RNA phosphodiester backbone (Figure 6), as in the Af L7Aebox C/D RNA complex (35, 36). The R40 B conformer in the free Mj structure is oriented in the same direction typical of the homologous structures, suggesting that R40 is mobile until it becomes involved in RNA interactions. Analysis of the R40 B-factor in the free L7Ae protein corroborates this idea (Figure 1 in the Supporting Information). Proline 54 lies on Mj L7Ae's surface and forms a bend in loop 5 adjacent to the 310 helix (Figure 6). In the Mj L7Aebox H/ACA duplex structure, C of P54 can make van der Waals contact with the extruded uridine of the K-turn motif. The position of P54 varies by 0.83 Å (rmsd) between the free Mj L7Ae structure and the L7Ae-RNA complex. When the rmsd values for P54 of each structure are compared (rather than the global rmsd differences), these residues differ only by 0.27 Å (Table 3). In the free complex, the P54 C-CR-N angle is greater by 1.4°, causing C of P54 to shift by 1.2 Å toward the RNA-binding interface. Valine 57 is also shifted toward loop 9 by approximately 0.5 Å in the free structure, resulting in an rmsd of 1.45 Å between the residues in the two structures (Figure 6). In fact, most of the residues in loop 5 through the 310 helix (from CR of D51 to C of V58) are shifted out of plane by several degrees (0.79 Å rmsd for these residues). Lysine 53 also appears to reorient, turning toward the RNA to make hydrogen bonding interactions. The loop 5-310 helix region also shifts slightly away from the binding interface upon RNA binding. Similar shifts are seen in the amino acids in loop 3 and the proximal end of R2 (residues G30-A37; 0.86 Å rmsd) and, much less frequently, in loop 9 (residues L87-S91; 0.14 Å rmsd; Figure 6). These results collectively suggest that small shifts, on the order of 0.8 Å, do occur in discrete secondary structural regions of the protein backbone upon RNA binding, although the net effects on the global structure are minimal. Structural Comparison to Homologous Proteins. Comparison to Archaeal and Eukaryotic L7Ae Homologues. Among other L7Ae homologues, the sequence (Figure 4B) and structure of Mj L7Ae are highly conserved (Figure 7 and Table 2 in the Supporting Information). Superposition of all determined archaeal L7Ae homologues from H. marismortui (26, 46), A. fulgidus (36), P. abyssii (47), A. pernix (J. Suryadi and A. B. Brown, II, manuscript in preparation) and the human 15.5kD protein (30) demonstrates that the global L7Ae structure is practically invariant, even

Structures are shown for M. jannaschii L7Ae (free) modeled with the box H/ACA duplex, Ar. fulgidus L7Ae bound to a box C/D RNA motif (0.656 Å CR rmsd), A. pernix L7Ae (free protein; 0.923 Å CR rmsd), H. marismortui bound to KT15 in the 23S rRNA (0.728 Å CR rmsd), and the human 15.5kD protein bound to U4 snRNA (1.104 Å CR rmsd). Note the similarity in the protein structures which indicates that the L7Ae structure is evolutionarily conserved and does not undergo significant change upon RNA binding.

when bound to RNA (Figure 7). The rmsds for the homologous proteins range from 0.723 Å for Pa L7Ae to 1.104 Å for human 15.5kD (Table 2 in the Supporting Information). The lengths of the secondary structural elements, particularly strands 2 and 3, are highly conserved among the L7Ae homologues, although the lengths of the N- and C-terminal loops and the penultimate R-helices vary to some extent. Sequence alignment of Mj L7Ae with other homologues indicates that Mj L7Ae (and its archaeal relative Methanococcus maripaludis) is apparently missing three residues in loop 2 between Q25 and K26 and one amino acid in R5 between L105 and K106 (Figure 4B and Figure 3 in the Supporting Information). Structural comparisons of the R1 region show that Mj L7Ae makes an abrupt bend from helix 1 into 1, where typical homologues have approximately one additional helical turn in R1. The missing residue in R5, based on the sequence alignment, appears to shorten loop 10, where the Mj L7Ae protein makes a sharp three-residue bend into R5. The Hm and Af L7Ae proteins have a fourresidue loop 10 that makes a more gradual transitions into R5. In contrast, the Pa and Ap L7Ae homologues have a proline residue coupled with a three-residue 310 helix to make this turn. The human 15.5kD protein has a seven-residue loop 10 (I106-L112) that extends outward, making a type II turn. Sequence comparison and modeling studies with other 15.5kD homologues suggest that this extended loop 10 is a common feature of the eukaryotic 15.5kD/Snu13p proteins. As mentioned above, all of the archaeal L7Ae proteins differ from eukaryotic homologues in loop 9. The consensus sequence for eukaryotic 15.5kD/Snu13p is C-G-V-S-R-PV-I, whereas archaeal organisms typically have loop 9 sequences of A-G-L/I-X-V-X-A-A, where X represents E, N, Q, G, or A and X represents A, S, G, or, to a lesser extent, P. These differences in sequence were noted by Hamma and Ferre-D'Amare, and proposed as the basis of ´ ´ RNA target specificity, primarily due to steric hindrance from the highly conserved arginine at the fifth position in loop 9 (35). Eukaryotic homologues containing this arginine are incapable of interacting with the box C/D sRNA motif (42,

Structure of a Multifunctional L7Ae RNA-Binding Protein 47). We propose that proline at position 6 in loop 9 may also contribute to RNA target specificity. Comparison to Archaeal and Eukaryotic L30 Homologues. The L7Ae proteins also are similar in structure and sequence to the eukaryotic L30 family of ribosomal proteins. The structures of both protein families are R- -R sandwiches, and they interact with K-turn RNA targets. Mj L7ae has 25 identical residues (32.2% similar) and a 1.37 Å rmsd with S. cereVisiae L30 and a 1.91 Å rmsd with 21 residues identical (33.9% similar) to T. celer L30 (Figure 4B and Table 2 in the Supporting Information). The L30 ribosomal proteins differ from the L7Ae proteins in that they do not have a 310 helix-loop 6 region between 2 and R-helix 3. Instead, they have a long continuous helix (R3) between loops 5 and 6 (Figure 4B). The L30 proteins also have shorter N- and C-termini compared to L7Ae homologues. Typically, L7Ae homologues have a long 10 residue loop 1 before beginning R-helix 1. At the N-terminus, S. cereVisiae L30 has a six-amino acid coiled region before beginning a short three-turn R-helix (12 residues), and T. celer L30 has only a three-residue loop 1, but a similar short R-helix which begins around the second turn in Mj L7Ae's R-helix 1 (residue E16). The C-termini are also different. L7Ae homologues have long four-turn R-helices (15 residues) with short one- or two-residue loop 10 regions at their C-termini. The L30 structures have shorter loop 10 regions which transition into a rough helix, formed by type II and IV hydrogen-bonded turns, terminating near the second turn from the end in the Mj L7Ae structure. These differences may permit structural differentiation between the similar L30 and L7Ae proteins by their respective binding partners. Another interesting difference is the structural flexibility of the loop 7-R4 region in the eukaryotic L30 protein. S. cereVisiae L30 interacts with K-turn RNAs like L7Ae does, but through a mutually induced-fit binding event, where both the protein and the RNA adopt different structures upon binding (48, 49, 80). In the free L30 protein, residues N74G78 form loop 7 and residues T79-G88 comprise R4 (Figure 4B). When RNA binds, a structural transition occurs, and residues N74-V81 become loop 7 and G82-G88 R4. Accompanying these structural transitions is a 13 Å (76°) shift of the loop 7 vertex from under the protein's core to the canonical position of loop 9 among the L7Ae/L30 homologues. Crystal and NMR structures of T. celer L30 have demonstrated that this archaeal protein does not undergo conformational transitions and is apparently preformed for interactions with RNA, like the archaeal L7Ae homologues (50, 51). On the basis of sequence comparisons, it appears that glycine residues at positions 72, 73, and 88 in Sc L30 are partly responsible for the structural transition upon RNA binding. Both the archaeal L30 and L7Ae homologues do not conserve glycine residues at these positions and are not prone to conformational changes; the amino acid residues at other positions within this region are fairly conserved in terms of function and size. Proteins with Structural Homology to L7Ae. Dali and VAST database searches (71, 72) indicated that the L7Ae family is structurally homologous to a number of diverse proteins, including domain 3 of H. sapiens eukaryotic release factor 1 [1DT9 (81)], T. thermophilus RNA 2-O-ribose methyltransferase [1IPA (82)], E. coli 23S RNA G2251 2O-ribose methyltransferase Rlmb [1GZO (83)], and Bacillus

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 28, 2005 9667 subtilis cytoplasmic ribose-binding protein Rbsd [1OGD (84)]. Structurally, these proteins have rmsds between 1.90 and 2.40 Å with the L7Ae proteins (Table 2 in the Supporting Information). All have subdomains with alternating R-helices and -strands and at least three- or four-strand -sheet cores. The structural similarity is primarily due to the -sheet cores surrounded by two to three R-helices, although the topologies differ considerably. Many of these proteins are involved in RNA modification or translation, and it is particularly notable that the two 2-O-ribose methyltransferases have structural features and functions similar to those of L7Ae, suggesting that this protein fold has been involved in RNA recognition since early in evolutionary time. Mj L7Ae Is an Extremely Stable Protein. We have performed thermal and chemical denaturation studies to gain insight into the stability of the L7Ae protein. The Mj L7Ae protein has an apparent melting temperature of 107.3 ( 5.0 °C (380.5 K), which corresponds to a van't Hoff denaturation enthalpy (HvH) of 70.4 ( 3.2 kcal/mol (294.8 ( 13.3 kJ/ mol) in 20 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 20 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA (Figure 8A). Denaturation is reversible with minimal hysteresis, and the protein can interact with RNA upon cooling. In fact, Mj L7Ae incubated at 100 °C for at least 30 min is still capable of binding box C/D RNA motifs when renatured! Mj L7Ae's thermal stability should not be surprising, considering that Mj's optimal growth temperature is around 86 °C. The melting temperature is approximately 20 °C greater than the growth temperature, which makes its denaturation temperature more reasonable in comparison to mesophilic proteins (i.e., Tm  50 °C for 25-30 °C growth optimums). In comparison, the melting temperature of the A. pernix L7Ae homologue is >110 °C and cannot be accurately measured using our standard conditions; A. pernix's optimal growth temperature is 90-95 °C. Mj L7Ae has seven salt bridges that interconnect most of the secondary structural elements and probably contributes to the enhanced thermal stability. In addition, the large number of intraprotein hydrogen bonds and the tightly packed hydrophobic core may also contribute to stability. Similar characteristics were noted in the L7Ae homologue from P. abyssii and in the T. celer L30 structure (47, 51). We also performed isothermal urea and guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn,HCl) denaturation experiments with Mj L7Ae. As with thermal denaturation, Mj L7Ae is quite resistant to chemical denaturation (Figure 8B). The midpoint for the Gdn,HCl denaturation titration at 25 °C was at 3.25 M Gdn,HCl, which corresponds to a Gibbs free energy of denaturation (GD,H2O) of 9.7 ( 1.4 kcal/mol (40.8 ( 5.8 kJ/mol) and an m value of 3.0 ( 0.42 kcal mol-1 M-1 (12.7 ( 1.8 kJ mol-1 M-1). For the urea-induced denaturation, the midpoint was at 6.9 M urea, yielding a GD of 8.7 ( 2.5 kcal/mol (36.6 ( 10.5 kJ/mol) and an m value of 1.3 ( 0.4 kcal mol-1 M-1 (5.3 ( 1.6 kJ mol-1 M-1). Both chemical denaturations were reversible, as the wavelength spectra resembled the native-state spectra after dilution or dialysis to remove the denaturant. The average GD,H2O between the urea and Gdn,HCl denaturation experiments is 9.2 ( 2.0 kcal/mol (38.7 ( 8.2 kJ/mol). Overall, these studies support the finding that Mj L7Ae is an extremely stable protein. Our results are similar to those of studies performed with the T. celer L30 protein (51). T.

These RNAs recapitulate the box C/D and C/D motifs in isolation (compare to Figure 1). Both motifs have previously been shown to bind the Mj box C/D sRNP core proteins. The box C/D halfmer sRNP complex is active in methylation assays, but the box C/D sRNP is not (42).

FIGURE 8: Thermal and chemical denaturation of M. jannaschii L7Ae. (A) Thermal denaturation of Mj L7Ae monitored by CD at 222 nm. L7Ae has an apparent melting temperature of 107.3 ( 5.0 °C which corresponds to a van't Hoff enthalpy of denaturation (HvH) of 70.4 ( 5.0 kcal/mol (294.8 ( 13.3 kJ/mol). The inset shows the Mj L7Ae CD wavelength spectrum from 200 to 280 nm, and the arrow denotes 222 nm, the signature wavelength for R-helical secondary structure. (B) Chemical denaturation of L7Ae. Guanidine hydrochloride (green squares) or urea (blue circles) induced denaturation of L7Ae. The midpoints for the titrations were 3.25 M Gdn,HCl and 6.9 M urea. Analyses of the individual denaturation transitions yielded a GD,H2O of 9.7 ( 1.4 kcal/mol and an m value of 3.0 ( 0.42 kcal mol-1 M-1 for Gdn,HCl and a GD,H2O of 8.7 ( 2.5 kcal/mol and an m value of 1.3 ( 0.4 kcal mol-1 M-1 for urea. The average GD,H2O between the urea and Gdn,HCl denaturation experiments is 9.2 ( 2.0 kcal/mol (38.7 ( 8.2 kJ/mol).

celer is also a thermophilic archaeon with an optimal growth temperature near that of M. jannaschii (85 °C). Interestingly, Tc L30 has a lower melting temperature than Mj L7Ae (94 vs 107 °C) but an increased resistance to chemical denaturation. Tc L7Ae denatures at 4.45 M Gdn,HCl, whereas Mj L7Ae denatures at 3.25 M Gdn,HCl. This may be due to the large number of ionic interactions that stabilize Mj L7Ae, masked by the high concentrations of Gdn,HCl, which is an ionic denaturant. Tc L30 has four short-range salt bridges, 12 long-range (6-8 Å) ionic interactions, and 75-80 intraprotein hydrogen bonds. In contrast, Mj L7Ae has nine short-range salt bridges (e4 Å), 17 long-range ionic interactions (between 4 and 8 Å), and 150 intraprotein hydrogen bonds. Thus, Mj L7Ae would be expected to be more destabilized in the high ionic strength of Gdn,HCl

relative to Tc L7Ae, and this inference is consistent with our results. L7Ae Induces RNA Conformational Changes upon Binding. Structural analyses have revealed that Mj L7Ae undergoes minimal conformational changes when binding to RNA. We were curious to see whether RNA targets showed conformational changes when L7Ae interacted with them. In these experiments, we used independent RNA constructs representing the box C/D or C/D motifs of the Mj sRNA sR8 (Figure 9). The box C/D halfmer construct can assemble sRNP complexes and catalyze 2-O-methylation in vitro (42). The box C/D motif can also bind all three core proteins, but is not enzymatically active in methylation assays (42). Our box C/D construct replicates the sR8 box C/D motif and contains an extra A,U base pair at the beginning of stem II for greater stability. Gel mobility shift analyses have demonstrated that L7Ae interacts with both the box C/D and C/D constructs at concentrations used in the CD studies described below (results not shown). Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to monitor conformational transitions in the RNA halfmer constructs, while aliquots of magnesium chloride were added to the samples as an initial analysis of structure. In fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) experiments, a KT-7 RNA construct of a K-turn motif found in helix 7 of 23S rRNA of the H. marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit undergoes conformational changes in response to magnesium (26, 39). These experiments validated our circular dichroism studies as a way of observing conformational changes induced by L7Ae. When samples of either the box C/D (Figure 10A) or C/D (Figure 10B) halfmers (5 µM RNA) were titrated with MgCl2 from 20 µM to 2 mM, changes in the molar ellipticity were observed. They were greatest at the peak molar ellipticity around 270 nm (268 nm for the box C/D halfmer and 272 nm for the box C/D halfmer), and smaller changes were observed in the 220 nm region. RNA CD spectra arise from  f * electronic transitions and are sensitive to nucleotide base stacking interactions and ribose pseudorotation (sugar pucker). When the molar ellipticity values at around 270 nm are plotted against the concentration of magnesium titrated, curves resembling binding isotherms are

FIGURE 10: Conformational changes in box C/D and C/D RNA structures induced by magnesium and L7Ae binding monitored by circular dichroism difference spectroscopy. Panels A, C, and E depict data for the box C/D halfmer, and panels B, D, and F depict data for the box C/D halfmer. Difference ellipticity values at peak wavelengths, 268 nm (A) and 272 nm (B), are plotted against magnesium concentration. Panels C and D show the difference ellipticity as Mj L7Ae is titrated with either the box C/D (C) or box C/D (D) halfmer at an L7Ae concentration from 1 to 5 µM, at a constant 5 µM RNA concentration. Additions of magnesium to 20 µM and 1 mM after L7Ae has been titrated to the equivalent stoichiometry are also indicated in plots C and D as filled red squares and circles, respectively. Panels E and F show results when magnesium is added in varying concentrations (filled red squares or circles, 20 µM, 1 mM, and 2 mM) to the RNA in 150 mM NaCl, and then L7Ae is titrated with stoichiometric amounts (5 µM protein and 5 µM RNA).

obtained (Figure 10A,B). The magnesium-induced structural transitions were saturated at concentrations greater than 1 mM MgCl2 for both RNA halfmers, although the C/D motif appears to saturate at lower concentrations. Overall, this result is in good agreement with findings obtained with KT-7, where the noncooperative magnesium-induced structural transition midpoint occurred at 1 mM Mg2+ (39). Full wavelength spectra of all panels in Figure 10 are included in the Supporting Information (Figure 4). Changes in molar ellipticity are different when either the box C/D or box C/D constructs are sequentially titrated with L7Ae (from 1 to 5 µM) in low-ionic strength buffer solutions without Mg2+ present [20 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0) and 20 mM NaCl]. In these experiments, the CD contributions from

the L7Ae protein have been subtracted, revealing only spectral changes resulting from the RNA motifs. The box C/D halfmer has a relatively constant molar ellipticity at 267 nm, but it steadily decreases at 221 nm (Figure 10C). In contrast, the box C/D halfmer exhibits a steady increase in molar ellipticity at 272 nm with a decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm (Figure 10D). When magnesium is supplemented in the samples at a concentration of 1 mM, significant changes occur [last two (red) points in panels C and D of Figure 10]. Both box C/D halfmers exhibit positive ellipticity increases in the 270 nm regions of their spectra, but have modest changes around 220 nm. These results indicate that L7Ae can induce structural changes in both box C/D halfmers, but they require Mg2+ (or other divalent cations)

9670 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 28, 2005 for favorable transition of the RNA. The effects of magnesium are more pronounced for the C/D halfmer, suggesting that this motif may require divalents more than its box C/D counterpart. When similar titration experiments are performed in physiological-like buffers containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM MgCl2, the results differ drastically. In these experiments, the RNA was equilibrated in the buffer, and then magnesium was added stepwise to a final concentration of 2 mM [the first three (red) points in panels E and F of Figure 10], followed by titration of L7Ae from 1 to 5 mM. The box C/D halfmer had a significant increase in molar ellipticity at 267 nm when magnesium was added but exhibited only modest increases in ellipticity when titrated with L7Ae (Figure 10E). The results agree with the previous results (Figure 10C) where L7Ae produced only modest effects in the absence of magnesium, but more pronounced effects in its presence. The results with the box C/D halfmer were similar: when magnesium was added to the RNA sample, ellipticity decreased modestly at 271 nm and produced virtually no change at 221 nm (Figure 10F). However, when L7Ae was titrated into the box C/D sample, both wavelengths showed ellipticity changes corresponding to the additions; ellipticity at 271 nm increased, and that at 221 nm decreased. These results virtually mirrored those in Figure 10D, where magnesium was added to the sample after addition of L7Ae. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that L7Ae and magnesium can both induce structural changes in the box C/D and C/D halfmer motifs. The dependence on magnesium is more pronounced with the box C/D halfmer than with the box C/D halfmer. This disparity may reflect the structural and topological differences between the two constructs. The box C/D motif contains a five- or sixnucleotide loop instead of stem I, which may be more flexible in transitioning into a K-turn motif and not require magnesium to the extent that the box C/D does. Studies with the wild-type sR8 molecule may provide more insight into the cation requirements and L7Ae-induced conformation changes occurring upon binding. CONCLUSIONS The high-resolution structure of Mj L7Ae has permitted detailed structural analysis of the free and RNA-bound protein. The structure of the free protein is remarkably similar to that bound to RNA, although several amino acids change conformation and the backbone slightly shifts when the RNA-protein complex is formed. Our detailed analyses have also shown that the L7Ae fold is highly conserved, although subtle amino acid changes and secondary structural regions distinguish the different homologues in this diverse protein family. Most importantly, we have shown that L7Ae induces conformational changes in box C/D sRNA motifs and "locks" the RNA in the K-turn conformation. K-Turn motifs are often dimorphic, existing in both a tightly kinked turn and a loosely bent form, depending on the concentration of divalent metal ions (39). We propose that L7Ae binds the loosely bent form and stabilizes the tightly kinked form in the presence of magnesium or other divalent ions. Conformational changes occurring upon binding are often observed in protein-RNA interactions (80). However, it is interesting that archaeal

Suryadi et al. L7Ae homologues apparently utilize protein-induced RNA folding, or RNA structure stabilization, while yeast L30 interacts through a mutually induced-fit mode of RNA binding, where both the protein and RNA change conformations. Further studies with additional eukaryotic L7Ae homologues are necessary to determine if this is a general trend. L7Ae is a multifunctional protein having at least three roles in archaeal organisms; these functions include being a core protein for both the box C/D and box H/ACA RNP complexes as well as a protein of the large 50S ribosome subunit. Archaeal L7Ae and its homologues have a strikingly wide range of RNA ligands with their binding specificity primarily being determined by the ability of the bound RNA to fold into the K-turn motif. A large number of diverse RNA ligands which contain K-turn motifs have been identified either by immunoaffinity chromatography of L7Ae-RNA complexes (85) or by direct cloning of cDNAs (86) from Sulfolobus solfataricus. Many of these noncoding sRNAs were sense-strand, antisense, or from intergenic regions and thus may have regulatory roles. Consequently, L7Ae or its homologues may be involved in such activities. In contrast, eukaryotic L7Ae homologues appear to have become more specialized in both functionality and RNA target recognition. For example, the 15.5kD/Snu13p protein appears to exclusively bind box C/D sn(o)RNAs and does not interact with the C/D motif; Nhp2p only interacts with box H/ACA snoRNAs, and a variety of homologous ribosomal proteins exist with different rRNA K-turn binding sites (e.g., L7a, L30, S12, and HS6). Collectively, these findings suggest that the L7Ae protein fold and its K-turn RNA ligands are ancient structural motifs which have been maintained and have evolved into specialized roles in a variety of RNA-related biological processes in both Archaea and Eucarya. NOTE ADDED IN PROOF A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) study by the Lilley group has independently corroborated that L7Ae induces conformational changes when binding to kink-turn RNAs (87).
