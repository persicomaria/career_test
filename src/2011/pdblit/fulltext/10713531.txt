The structure of the neutral peroxidase from Arabidopsis thaliana Ê (ATP N) has been determined to a resolution of 1.9 A and a free R value of 20.5%. ATP N has the expected characteristic fold of the Ê class III peroxidases, with a C r.m.s.d. of 0.82 A when compared with horseradish peroxidase C (HRP C). HRP C is 54% identical to ATP N in sequence. When the structures of four class III plant peroxidases are superimposed, the regions with structural differences are non-randomly distributed; all are located in one half of the molecule. The architecture of the haem pocket of ATP N is very similar to that of HRP C, in agreement with the low small-molecule substrate speci®city of all class III peroxidases. The structure of ATP N suggests that the pH dependence of the substrate turnover will differ from that of HRP C owing to differences in polarity of the residues in the substrate-access channel. Since there are fewer hydrogen bonds to haem C17 propionate O atoms in ATP N than in HRP C, it is suggested that ATP N will lose haem more easily than HRP C. Unlike almost all other class III plant peroxidases, ATP N has a free cysteine residue at a similar position to the suggested secondary substrate-binding site in lignin peroxidase.

1. Introduction
Peroxidases are oxidoreductases that catalyze the oxidation of substrates using hydrogen peroxide as the electron acceptor. They are widespread in nature and are expressed by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Unlike the copper-containing laccases, which all have very similar three-dimensional structures, signi®cant covalent and structural variation is seen among the haem-containing peroxidases. This has lead to a sequence-based de®nition of superfamilies (Welinder, 1992). Class I peroxidases are intracellular peroxidases of prokaryotic origin and include, for example, mitochondrial yeast cytochrome c peroxidase. Class II consists of secreted fungal peroxidases exempli®ed by lignin peroxidase. Class III peroxidases are the higher plant peroxidases targeted for the secretory pathway with horseradish peroxidase C as the most thoroughly studied example. The many peroxidase isozymes generally found in plants have given rise to debate and speculation on the signi®cance and background of their diversity. It is obvious that the Arabidopsis sequencing project constitutes an opportunity to study the structure±function relationships and the signi®cance of the full repertoire of class III peroxidases in a single species. The ATP N protein has not been isolated from A. thaliana plants, but the gene has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli

(Teilum et al., 1999). The gene coding for a closely related peroxidase from horseradish roots HRP N (89% sequence identity) is also Ê known (Bartonek-Roxa et al., 1991). HRP N has never been isolated from horseradish Ê (Bartonek-Roxa & Eriksson, 1994) and the enzyme differs from the known neutral peroxidases HRP B1±B3 (Aibara et al., 1982).

2. Results
2.1. Crystallization

Expression in E. coli and folding of a novel neutral (pI 7.8) peroxidase from A. thaliana (ATP N) was optimized as reported previously (Teilum et al., 1999). Crystals were grown by vapour diffusion from this enzyme preparation using hanging-drop experiments. A protein solution was dialyzed against 10 mM NaAc pH 4.8 and concentrated to 1.64 mg mlÀ1. Crystals appeared after one week when drops containing 2 ml protein solution plus 2 ml 20% PEG 4000, 10% 2-propanol, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5 were equilibrated against a reservoir containing 20% PEG 4000, 10% 2-propanol, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5 at 277 K.

The crystal-to-detector distance was 300 mm. All data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). ATP N crystallizes in the space group P212121, with unit-cell paraÊ meters a = 73.0, b = 87.5, c = 91.4 A and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Datacollection statistics are given in Table 1.

The part of the HRP C trace that corresponds to variable regions in presently known class III structures is coloured blue and red (the red part is the long stretch which is completely missing in the plant peroxidase insert of peanut peroxidase). The almost coincident side chains of the distal histidine and arginine are shown. The glutathione linked to the Cys275 of ATP N (corresponding to Glu279 in HRP C) is also shown. The ®gure was produced with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994).

The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The crystal structure of HRP C (Gajhede et al., 1997) was used as a search model. The molecular-replacement searches, made in Ê the resolution range 10±4 A, gave two clear solutions related by twofold non-crystallographic symmetry. The subsequent rebuilding and re®nement of the structure was performed using O (Jones et al., 1991) and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) with the Engh±Huber force-®eld parameters (Engh & Huber, 1991). During the re®nement, 5% of the data were set aside for calculation of the Rfree value. After replacement with the correct residues, the structure was subjected to a 5000 K simulated annealing using torsion-angle re®nement and the MLF target function in CNS to remove model bias. Cycles of simulated annealing from lower temperatures and manual ®tting followed until the ®nal model was obtained. The bulk-solvent correction was applied during all re®nement stages. Two B factors per residue were initially re®ned and restrained individual B factors were ®nally re®ned. Strict NCS was applied in the early stages of re®nement. All constraints were removed in the ®nal part of re®nement. Water molecules were found using CNS and were only kept in the model if they returned well shaped 2Fo À Fc density above 1' and were involved in hydrogen bonding. Re®nement statistics are given in Table 2. ATP N contains one cysteine residue (Cys275) which is not involved in a disul®de bridge and excess electron density was observed in close proximity to the S atom of Cys275. This electron density could be described by a glutathione molecule (GSH) disul®de linked to Cys275. The initial coordinates and parameters for the GSH molecule were found in the HIC-UP database (Kleywegt & Jones, 1998). The attachment of the glutathione moiety is expected to arise from the refolding of the recombinant enzyme from inclusion bodies (Teilum et al., 1999).

3. Discussion
Fig. 1 shows a superposition of ATP N and HRP C, which serves as a representative of the class III peroxidases. A stereoview of the ATP N C trace is shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that the two enzymes have a very similar fold, as indicated by the C superposition Ê r.m.s.d. of 0.82 A. In comparison, the r.m.s.d. between the two NCS-related ATP N Ê molecules is 0.3 A. However, in regions

corresponding to the sequences outside the boxes in the structural alignment in Fig. 2 signi®cant differences are observed. Remarkably, all these divergent regions are situated in one half of the molecule. This also includes the deletion found in peanut peroxidase (Schuller et al., 1996). It is possible that these differences are of importance with respect to peroxidase speci®city towards macromolecular substrates (other proteins or cell-wall components) or associated molecules such as the dirigent enzymes (Gang et al., 1999). However, four of these variable regions

Structural alignment of ATP N and the class III peroxidases with known active enzyme structures. atpn denotes ATP N, peap is peanut peroxidase (Schuller et al., 1996), atpa is ATP A2 (éstergaard et al., 2000) and hrpc is HRP C. The alignment was produced using the programs STAMP (Russell & Barton, 1992) and ALSCRIPT (Barton, 1993). Stretches corresponding to genuine topological equivalence (Russell & Barton, 1992) are boxed Ê Ê (r.m.s.d. including the boxed 276 C atoms from each enzyme is 0.65 A). Residues less than 12 A from the -meso haem edge have red backgrounds and those that are known to also be in contact with substrates in the HRP C± BHA or HRP C±FA complexes have a yellow background. The HRP C sequence numbers and the DSSP assignments of secondary-structure elements (Kabsch & Sander, 1983) follow the alignment. The last line shows -helix assignments; residues marked `&' are found at the glycosylated sites of wild-type HRP C (Welinder, 1979).

Figure 3

coincide with the glycosylation sites of wildtype HRP C (Welinder, 1979), which could indicate little mutational strain. Ê A sphere with a radius of 12 A from the -meso haem edge will include atoms from all residues of the substrate-access channel. As can be seen from Fig. 3, a total of 37 ATP N residues are within the sphere. Any residue interacting directly with smallmolecule substrates is likely to be part of this subset. Of the subset, 14 ATP N residues differ from those found in HRP C. Disregarding conservative substitutions, ®ve important changes remain. These are (using HRP C as a reference) Phe143Glu, Lys174Gln, Asn175Ala, Gln176Lys and Arg178Ala. From these substitutions, the electrostatic properties of ATP N's haem surroundings must be different from those of the HRP C haem. The pH dependence of substrate turnover must also be expected to be different in the two enzymes. Those HRP C residues that have substrate contacts in the HRP C±benzhydroxamic acid (BHA; Henriksen et al., 1998) and HRP C±ferulic acid (FA; Henriksen et al., 2000) complexes are also marked in Fig. 2. Of these nine residues, four are changed in ATP N and all four changes are conservative. The most important substitutions seems to be Phe179Val, which leaves the active site slightly more open in ATP N, and Ala140Ser, which provides another possible hydrogen bond to substrate in ATP N. There are signi®cant differences between ATP N and HRP C with respect to the hydrogen bonding to the C17 haem propionate closest to the substrate-access channel entry. In HRP C, the propionate is hydrogen bonded to Asn175 and Gln176, Ê although the last bond is long (3.9 A). The substitution Gln176Lys in ATP N still allows hydrogen bonding, but in HRP C the position of Gln176 is ®xed by a hydrogen bond

Stereo drawing of the hydrogen-bonding pattern around C17 haem propionate of HRP C and ATP N (superimposed). The C atoms of the HRP C residues His175, His176 and His178 and ATP N residues Ala170, Ala171 and Ala173 have the same colour coding as in Fig. 1. The HRP C residues are labelled with an H and the ATP N residues with an A. Both haem groups are shown in the corresponding colours. The HRP C hydrogen bonds are colored cyan; those of ATP N are coloured blue. The C17 propionate in HRP C is hydrogen bonded by residues 175 and 176. Furthermore, the position of the latter is ®xed by hydrogen bonding to residue 178. In ATP N, only one hydrogen bond links the propionate and the apoprotein via Lys171. The residues corresponding to Asn175 and Gln171 are replaced by alanines in ATP N.

to Arg178 N4. Arg178 is replaced by Ala in ATP N, so the lysine has full conformational freedom. Asn175 is also replaced by Ala in ATP N. These substitutions weaken the binding of the haem group in ATP N and ATP N might release haem more easily than HRP C. The hydrogen-bonding differences are shown in Fig. 4. A large piece of coherent excess electron density is found in the distal haem pocket. This electron density is not associated with ATP N and extends from right above the FeIII ion out into the substrate-access channel. The density is probably disordered water and buffer molecules. The distance from the closest peak in the electron density Ê to the Fe atom is 2.7 A. A water molecule is found at this position in HRP C (Gajhede et
Acta Cryst. (2000). D56, 372±375

al., 1997). An O atom only was included at this position in the ®nal model of ATP N to describe the excess electron density. Thus, the coordination number of the iron appears to be ®ve in ATP N, as in HRP C. This O atom is also within hydrogen-bonding distance of the distal histidine and the distal arginine. The disordered electron density is also within hydrogen-bonding distance of the carbonyl O atom of the conserved Pro134 (Pro139 in HRP C). This agrees with the need for a water molecule at this position in the proposed mechanism for substrate oxidation (Henriksen et al., 2000). Both the distal and proximal Ca2+ binding sites are very similar to the sites in HRP C. The distal site is seven-coordinated, with the ligands being carbonyl and side-chain O atoms and a water molecule. The proximal site is six-coordinated, with only carbonyl groups and side-chain O atoms as ligands. The sequence of HRP C contains eight cysteine residues all engaged in disul®de bridges. In ATP N, an additional cysteine positioned at the centre of the J helix (Cys275) is bound to glutathione. Fig. 5 shows the 2Fo À Fc density corresponding to the glutathione moiety. It is noteworthy that superpositioning of ATP N and lignin peroxidase shows that this easily oxidizable Ê amino acid is less than 5 A from the position of the chemically modi®ed tryptophan (Trp171) in lignin peroxidase (Choinowski et al., 1999). Trp171 is suggested to be part of an alternative substrate-binding site in lignin peroxidase. However, the two positions are not related. They appear in different structurally conserved segments and only a few other peroxidases are found to have a cysteine residue at positions equivalent to
