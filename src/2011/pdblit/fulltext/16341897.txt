Structural evidence for a proton transfer pathway coupled with haem reduction of cytochrome c¢¢ from Methylophilus methylotrophus

Abstract The crystal structures of the oxidized and reduced forms of cytochrome c¢¢ from Methylophilus methylotrophus were solved from X-ray synchrotron data to atomic resolution. The overall fold of the molecule in the two redox states is very similar and is comparable to that of the oxygen-binding protein from the purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. However, significant modifications occur near the haem group, in particular the detachment from axial binding of His95 observed upon reduction as well as the adoption of different conformations of some protonatable residues that form a possible proton path from the haem pocket to the protein surface. These changes are associated with the previously well characterized redox-Bohr behaviour of this protein. Furthermore they provide a model for one of the presently proposed mechanisms of proton translocation in the much more complex protein cytochrome c oxidase.

methylotrophus containing 124 amino acids and having a molecular mass of 14.2 kDa. It has some unusual features for a monohaem cytochrome, such as bishistidinyl axial coordination of the haem group, which is linked to cysteine residues quite far downstream from the N-terminus, and a disulphide bridge near the C-terminus formed between two further cysteines. The pH dependence of the midpoint redox potential in this cytochrome has been characterized in detail, as has the unusual redox-linked spin-state transition, from low spin in the oxidized form to high spin in the reduced form. This transition is associated with detachment of one of the histidine ligands during the reduction process [1, 2]. Therefore, the reduced cytochrome has a binding site available for small ligands such as CO, CN¿ and NO. The structure of the oxidized form of cytochrome c¢¢ in solution was solved by NMR methods and confirmed the special structural features as proposed earlier from spectroscopic data [2≠7]. Propionate 17 (labelled A in PDB format, which will be used henceforward) and His95 were considered to have a special role in the redox-Bohr effect, and some other protonatable residues, Glu91 in particular, were also suggested to be involved in this process. The oxygen-binding protein from the purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, SHP, has a high sequence and structure similarity to cytochrome c¢¢ [8] and also undergoes detachment of one of its haem axial ligands, an asparagine, upon reduction. However, the structural rearrangement observed is rather limited and, furthermore, no redox-Bohr behaviour is observed in this case. The redox-Bohr effect [9] is a thermodynamic coupling between the reduction of redox groups and protonation of ionizing groups. An interesting challenge in the study of proteins that show this behaviour is the identification of the residues responsible for the effect, and also of those that may form a proton path from the haem pocket to the protein surface. Thus, cytochrome c¢¢ could be used as a model for mechanisms of proton translocation in the redox-driven proton pump of cytochrome c oxidase [10, 11].

We solved the structure of cytochrome c¢¢ in the oxidized and in the reduced form to elucidate the molecular basis of the redox-Bohr effect and which residues are involved and, hence, to identify a route for the proton uptake that accompanies reduction of the haem. Moreover, it is to be hoped that detailed structural information of both redox states may shed light on the yet unknown physiological role of this unusual cytochrome.

obtained was submitted to prime and switch phasing using RESOLVE [16] to eliminate model bias. Model building and refinement The original phases of the oxidized structure obtained by ∞ MAD with data to 1.80-A resolution, derived from interpretation of anomalous Patterson maps and density modification by SOLVE≠RESOLVE [16], were extended ∞ to 1.19-A resolution using the maximum resolution data set available with DM [17] from the CCP4 suite [14]. Using this extended phase information, initial model building was performed automatically using ARP/ WARP, version 5.1 [18]. After 50 cycles of refinement and five cycles of building, 95% of the protein residues were found (120 out of 124), and placed in seven chains, with a global connectivity index of 0.98. At the end of the automatic building procedure, the refinement converged to an R factor of 19.2% and an Rfree factor of 23.1%. The amino acid side chains, built with the side_dock script included in the ARP/WARP suite, had a confidence factor of 0.95. After this process, manual intervention was required to complete the model. Missing sections were built from 2Fo¿Fc maps using Xtalview [19]. The Xtalview suite was also employed to complete the solvent boundary of the protein model. The resulting protein model was refined with SHELXL ∞ [20] in steps of increasing resolution from 1.4 to 1.19 A. Bulk solvent correction and Engh and Huber stereochemical restraints were applied during the refinement. Atomic anisotropic displacement parameters were refined, and hydrogen atoms (using the riding model) were introduced at the end of the refinement. The final coordinates were deposited in the PDB database with the accession code 1GU2 (Table 1). Phases of the reduced structure obtained by molecular replacement were used for an automated building procedure by ARP/WARP [18]. The protein model obtained was refined by REFMAC [21]. Positional and isotropic thermal parameters were refined individually ∞ for each atom to a resolution limit of 1.95 A. The sulphur atoms of residues Cys96 and Cys104 were refined with full occupancy in the oxidized structure, but showed some disorder in the reduced structure. To obtain thermal parameters on the order of magnitude of the neighbouring atoms a 50% occupancy was used for these positions in the refinement of the reduced structure. The final coordinates were deposited in the PDB database with the accession code 1OAE (Table 1).

Materials and methods
Protein crystallization, data collection and structure solution Crystals of oxidized cytochrome c¢¢ were grown by vapour diffusion on 2.5 M ammonium sulphate, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mM CdCl2 and 100 mM tris(hydroymethyl)aminomethane maleate pH 7.0, as described previously [12]. They belong to the P2(1)2(1)2(1) space group ∞ with cell constants of a=58.5, b=74.1, c=78.3 A, a=b=c=90.0∞. The initial attempts to obtain crystals of reduced cytochrome c¢¢ involved the screening of crystallization conditions using a reduced solution of protein. These attempts were unsuccessful. The second trial started from the oxidized crystals and their reduction was attempted by using an excess of dithionite in the solid form and confirmed by the characteristic colour change of the protein from orange≠red in the oxidized form to magenta in the reduced form. Diffraction data were collected but the solved structure showed no redox-induced change in the position of the residues coordinating the haem. Finally, oxidized crystals were soaked in the mother liquor containing 1 mM dithionite. The protein was reduced, as monitored by the colour change, and the crystals were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. A complete dataset of a reduced cytochrome c¢¢ crystal was collected at DESY, EMBL, Hamburg, beamline X11, to a maxi∞ mum resolution of 1.95 A. No significant modification of the cell parameters was observed in the reduced crystals and, although significant redox-related conformational changes were found, it remains possible that the changes could be more extensive in solution. For the resolution of the oxidized structure of cytochrome c¢¢, a complete multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) experiment at the Fe edge was performed using BW7A beamline at DESY, EMBL, Hamburg [13]. Another crystal was used to collect a high-resolution ∞ dataset to 1.19 A, at the X11 beamline. The position of the iron atoms within the haems was determined by the interpretation of the anomalous Patterson maps using SOLVE 1.18 [12]. The final refined positions were used to calculate the corresponding phases, which were ex∞ tended to 1.19 A, using DM [14]. The final refined oxidized structure of cytochrome c¢¢ was used as a seeding model for molecular replacement with MOLREP from the CCP4 suite [15] on the data collected from the reduced crystal. The solution

within the most favourable regions (99%), with the exception of Thr54, in both the reduced and oxidized structures. The root-mean-square deviation between the ∞ two structures is 0.321 A, as calculated by MODELLER [23], and shows that both structures are similar in terms of the protein main chain. Common features of the oxidized and reduced structures of cytochrome c¢¢ The overall fold of cytochrome c¢¢ of the oxidized form is almost identical to that of the reduced form, and consists of four main a-helices (a1, a2, a4, a5), one further short a-helix (a3) and two short antiparallel b-sheets (b1≠b2 and b3≠b4) as indicated in Fig. 1 and represented in Fig. 2. Helix a4 is five residues longer in the reduced structure owing to a displacement observed in some residues upon reduction as described later. The solution structure of the oxidized form of cytochrome c¢¢ determined by NMR [25] has essentially the same secondary structural elements but has extended loops in the region now organized as helix a3 and b-sheet b3≠b4. The X-ray structure of the SHP protein of R. sphaeroides [8] has a similar overall fold but has even less secondary structure, missing the first b-sheet (b1≠b2) with extended loops in this and in the helix a3-sheet b3≠b4 regions. As in those structures, the polypeptide chain wraps around the prosthetic haem group, with the first helix interacting with the last one. Comparison of these features with typical structures of class I monohaem cytochromes confirms a common structural organization but with an extra helix at the N-terminus as in the case of the SHP protein [8, 25]. The haem is covalently bound to the protein chain by Cys49 and Cys52 which are located in the conserved motif CXXCH and nestles in an essentially conserved hydrophobic pocket (Phe34, Phe39, Cys49, Cys52, Ile70, Pro71, Leu73, Phe82, Val88, Phe92, Ile99, Leu100). Rings A and D together with the propionate chain D are exposed with 15% of the total haem surface interacting with solvent. Propionate chain A is buried in the protein

core. A hydrogen bond is formed between propionate D and the side chain of Arg81 (OD2...NH2 distance of ∞ 2.61 A), contributing to anchoring the prosthetic group to the protein chain. Structural differences between the oxidized and the reduced forms of cytochrome c¢¢ Figure 3 shows 2Fo¿Fc electron density maps defining the configuration around the haems in both structures of cytochrome c¢¢. In the oxidized form the haem iron is axially coordinated by His53 and His95 with their imidazole planes in an almost perpendicular orientation, forming an angle of 88∞. This is the second example, after cytochrome c549 from Synechocystis spp. [26] of a soluble monohaem cytochrome c with bishistidinyl haem axial coordination. The majority of the c-type monohaem cytochromes show iron His≠Met coordination [27]. However, and as predicted [2, 4], the reduced form of cytochrome c¢¢ has the sixth axial iron ligand, His95, detached from the original coordinating position. Thus, reduction induces a change from hexa- to penta-coordination at the iron atom (Fig. 3b) with an associated change in the spin state from low to high spin. The change in conformation of His95 creates a local hole just below the haem pocket in the protein surface of the reduced structure (Fig. 4a, b). A second hole also appears owing to the movement of propionate D. A further interesting and unusual feature in cytochrome c¢¢, is the presence of a disulphide bridge between Cys96 and Cys104, close to the haem region [25]. ∞ The S atoms are 2.06 A apart in the oxidized structure, while in the reduced structure these atoms showed some disorder (see before) with a corresponding distance of ∞ 2.56 A. However, possibly owing to crystal packing effects, no significant changes are observed in the local protein fold. The possible involvement of the disulphide bridge in the reduction process remains unclear. The increment in the S≠S bond distance might be the result of radiation damage, although both data sets were collected in similar conditions at the same synchrotron

The structures are rainbow coloured following the standard criteria (blue in the N-terminus to red in the C-terminus). Note that the helix represented in yellow is longer in the reduced form of the protein, because of the displacement of the main chain, which introduces an additional amino acid (Asp84) into the helical segment. The figure was produced with Pymol [24]

source. Alternatively, partial reduction of the disulphide bridge cannot be ruled out. The differences between the structure of the oxidized and the reduced forms of cytochrome c¢¢ extend from the haem to the protein surface. Figure 5 shows a superposition of the two structures in the region most affected. In the top part of Fig. 5, residues show only small deviations. For example, in the reduced structure, propionate D remains stabilized by a hydrogen bond to ∞ Arg81 (O2D...NH2 distance of 2.65 A). However, some residues clearly show a different conformation in the two structures, namely His95, propionate A, Glu91, and Asp90. Upon reduction, His95 detaches from the haem ∞ and comes within hydrogen-bonding distance, 2.85 A, of one of the carboxy oxygen atoms of propionate A (O2A). This group experiences a notable switch from an extended to a backwards conformation. Additionally ∞ Glu91 switches from partial solvent exposure (95 A2 of exposed surface) where it is not in close contact with any ∞ neighbouring residue (less than 4.5 A) to a buried con∞ 2 of exposed surface) and Asp90 moves formation (65 A ∞ significantly, from a completely (104 A2 of exposed ∞ surface) to a less exposed site (80 A2 of exposed surface).

Considering the conformers of these residues in the reduced form with respect to the positions of the neighbouring residue in the oxidized form, some interesting distances are found. One of the carboxy oxygens of ∞ Asp90red is within 3.69 A of one of the carboxy oxygens of Glu91oxi, while one of the carboxy oxygens of ∞ Glu91redis 1.94 A from one of the carboxy oxygens of propionate Aoxi. One must bear in mind that these distances refer to positions that do not coexist in either of the structures now reported. However, NMR data from the oxidized protein are consistent with propionate A spending part of the time in the folded back conformation [25]. Thus, we infer some conformational mobility, which allows successive conformational changes to transport a proton along the path in a stepwise mechanism. When the protein is reduced and a proton captured, the entry site for this proton could well be Asp90. By adopting its new conformation, as in the reduced conformer, Asp90 would transfer this proton to Glu91, which then also changes conformation, supplying the proton to propionate A, which in turn switches towards His95 that, in the reduced form, has adopted a suitable position to receive it. Thus, detachment of His95 from

axial iron coordination correlates with several structural rearrangements. The redox-Bohr behaviour of this protein was interpreted as involving an unusual negative effect associated with the propionate ionization [4]. Normally, the proximity of a negatively charged carboxylate would stabilize the oxidized haem electrostatically and, conversely, its pKa would be increased in the reduced form. Here, the opposite occurs because the change in coordination and conformation allows the carboxylate to stabilize the displaced histidine. Accurate and specific pKa values are not available for the groups near the haem, but approximate values of 6.4 in the oxidized form and 5.4 in the reduced form were attributed to the carboxylate of propionate A [4]. Thus, the propionate should be fractionally protonated in the oxidized form, ready to receive a proton and deliver it to the histidine upon reduction. Indeed, if the propionate were fully protonated in the oxidized form, that proton would simply be transferred to the histidine upon reduction. Hence, the detached axial histidine ligand is stabilized by the capture of a proton arriving through the path proposed earlier. Further significant differences are observed between redox states, particularly in the protein segment comprising residues 85≠97 (Fig. 5). The main chain of this

region suffers a significant displacement with alterations in the positions of the respective side chains. For ∞ example, the main chain at Asp86 is shifted 2.14 A into the core of the haem binding region, while Asp84 moves in the opposite direction. As a result, Asp84 changes ∞ from low solvent exposure (59 A2 of exposed surface) to ∞ 2 of exposed surface). This surface availability (84 A movement incorporates Asp84 in the structure of helix a3, making this helix segment slightly longer in the structure of the reduced protein than in the oxidized form (Figs. 2, 4). The structural rearrangements that accompany reduction change the electrostatic surface potential (Fig. 6). The surface around Asp90 and Glu91 becomes less negative, while that around Asp84 and Asp86 becomes more negative. The first effect may be due to one less protonatable site in the area, and the second one may just be needed to balance the charges at the protein surface. The disulphide bridge sits in a much less perturbed part of the molecule and the mechanism of its involvement in the ligand displacement is not obvious. We know, however, that reduction and alkylation of the disulphide bridge prevented histidine detachment upon reduction [25].

Discussion
The crystal structures of the oxidized and reduced forms of M. methylotrophus cytochrome c¢¢ were determined. The comparison of these structures enabled a full characterization of the remarkable conformational changes associated with the iron reduction and concomitant detachment and protonation of His95. Furthermore, a series of conformational changes in charged residues was identified in the region of the haem pocket that could provide a pathway for proton translocation. The physiological function for this unusual protein remains elusive despite the wealth of structural information available, but there are some pointers worth considering. The detachment of the iron ligand suggests a function that could involve binding of a small molecule. Cytochrome cd1, nitrate reductase [29, 30] and various cytochrome c peroxidases [29, 31] are other proteins in which a change in iron coordination is induced by a change in redox state. These proteins have two domains, with one haem in each domain, and undergo an overall change in conformation between domains from the oxidized to the reduced form. The haem related with enzymatic activity has bishistidinyl coordination and one ligand detaches upon reduction to allow for substrate binding during the catalytic cycle. The oxygen-binding monohaem SHP protein has the most similar structure to that of cytochrome c¢¢. The structure of SHP was determined in the oxidized and reduced states and also in the complex with cyanide, a ligand that inhibits oxygen binding, and with nitric oxide, a ligand that mimics oxygen binding [8]. The haem ligands in SHP are an asparagine and a histidine residue. Upon reduction (or upon CN and NO binding), the asparagine ligand moves away from the iron but the structural rearrangements in the haem binding pocket are small. However, oxygen binding could not be demonstrated in cytochrome c¢¢ (our unpublished results) and, in contrast with cytochrome c¢¢, no redox-Bohr effect is observed in SHP.

It is well established that CO, CN¿ and NO can bind to the reduced cytochrome [2], although the affinity constants have not been determined. The structure of the reduced form clearly revealed a hole created by the displacement of His95 (Fig. 4), which could accommodate ligands of such size, but no enzymatic activity has yet been discovered. However, this hypothesis, possibly involving the neighbouring disulphide bridge, cannot be definitely ruled out. On the other hand, the ingenious mechanism that enables cytochrome c¢¢ to couple electron and proton transfer is clearly purposeful. A detailed understanding of this mechanism would need further experimental studies, or theoretical calculations such as continuum electrostatic and Monte Carlo sampling of protonation and redox states [32, 33]. This methodology, combined with high-resolution determinations of oxidized and reduced structures, has been applied to multihaem electron transfer cytochromes [34]. In these cases, however, the coupled proton≠electron transfer was associated with small conformational changes that occurred in propionates of some of the haems and with a few charged residues located in the neighbourhood, and haem coordination was unperturbed. Despite the unknown function, the structural insights reported here for cytochrome c¢¢ could provide a simple model for elements of the much more complex system of cytochrome c oxidase, which pumps protons across the membrane and reduces oxygen to water in its binuclear site. Although there is great controversy [35, 36], a mechanism for proton translocation has been proposed [37] and recently reformulated [33], centred on a watergating system. In this system, alternative internal water chains would conduct protons from a conserved and central residue, a glutamic acid, either to one of the propionates of haem a3 for proton translocation or to the binuclear centre (haem a3-CuB) for water formation. Switching between these pathways is controlled by the redox state of the two centres. This scheme would imply a central role for this glutamic acid and the alternative

196

water chains in the redox-Bohr behaviour of this complex molecule. Pathways for proton transfer such as that derived from the present study in cytochrome c¢¢ might help to clarify such proposals. Furthermore, the negative redoxBohr effect observed in cytochrome c¢¢ has inspired a coherent mechano-chemical model for energy transduction in cytochrome c oxidase [10, 38]. The much smaller, soluble protein, cytochrome c¢¢, does not pump protons through a membrane, and thus does not need such a sophisticated mechanism. However, the concerted change of conformation in residues Asp90, Glu91, propionate A and His95,seems to be critical for the coupling of electron acceptance and proton uptake in cytochrome c¢¢. This redox-Bohr behaviour may correlate with an enzymatic activity as in the examples quoted earlier or may just relate to an electron transfer capacity for this cytochrome. Further experimental work is needed to validate this hypothesis and to understand why these structural alterations are necessary for cytochrome c¢¢ to accomplish its as yet unknown biological function.
