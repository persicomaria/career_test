Genetic changes lead gradually to altered protein function, making deduction of the molecular basis for activity from a sequence difficult. Comparative studies provide insights into the functional consequences of specific changes. Here we present structural and biochemical studies of NtrC4, a sigma-54 activator from Aquifex aeolicus, and compare it with NtrC1 (a paralog) and NtrC (a homolog from Salmonella enterica) to provide insight into how a substantial change in regulatory mechanism may have occurred. Activity assays show that assembly of NtrC4's active oligomer is - repressed by the N-terminal receiver domain, and that BeF3 addition (mimicking phosphorylation) removes this repression. Observation of assembly without activation for NtrC4 indicates that it is much less strongly repressed than NtrC1. The crystal structure of the unactivated receiver­ATPase domain combination shows a partially disrupted interface. NMR structures of the regulatory domain show that its activation mechanism is very similar to that of NtrC1. The crystal structure of the NtrC4 DNA-binding domain shows that it is dimeric and more similar in structure to NtrC than NtrC1. Electron microscope images of the ATPase­ DNA-binding domain combination show formation of oligomeric rings. Sequence alignments provide insights into the distribution of activation mechanisms in this family of proteins.

Mechanism of Aquifex aeolicus NtrC4

1059 The sigma-70 polymerase binds at cognate sites in promoters, opens DNA, and then initiates transcription. Its activity is regulated by other proteins. The effects can be negative (e.g., other proteins can compete for overlapping binding sites in promoters) or positive (as in factors that alter DNA structure to enhance binding). Sigma-70 can also be sequestered by anti-sigma factors that prevent it from associating with core subunits.2 In contrast, there are few proteins that modify the binding of sigma-54 polymerase to DNA, and there are no known sigma-54 anti-sigma factors. However, even when bound to a cognate promoter, sigma-54 is unable to initiate transcription on its own.12 To open the promoter and to begin transcription, sigma-54 polymerase requires the action of a transcriptional activator protein, which uses ATP hydrolysis to remodel the polymerase­DNA complex to make it competent for transcription initiation.13 Regulation generally occurs through stringent control of the assembly of the active state of the ATPase. This difference leads to a generally tighter regulation for sigma-54-dependent promoters and allows sigma54 to respond rapidly to environmental changes with a large dynamic range in transcriptional activity.12,14,15 Sigma-54 activator proteins are usually composed of regulatory, AAA ATPase, and sequence-specific

Introduction
Regulation of gene transcription is a critical part of cells' responses to all kinds of internal and environmental changes. Overall, regulation is much simpler in bacteria than in eukaryotes, and many key mechanisms through which regulation occurs in bacteria have been identified.1,2 The sigma subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase is responsible for promoter recognition and plays a major role in regulation of transcription. Bacteria use many variant sigma factors to allow differential gene expression in a well-regulated manner. Most of these sigma factors are related in sequence and function to the major type sigma-70, with truncations and/or sequence alterations that modify their activity and interactions with other cellular factors.3 Most bacteria also have an alternate sigma factor, sigma-54, that shares no detectable sequence similarity with the sigma-70 family and is distinct in its role in transcription initiation. Sigma-54 promoters are found upstream of a small subset of genes in most bacteria.4 Sigma-54 controls tightly regulated processes such as the nitrogen and sulfate limitation responses5­7 and quorum sensing.8 Sigma-54 also regulates the expression of virulence factors in several human pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa9 and Borrelia burgdorferi.10,11

1060 DNA-binding domains.16 Unlike most bacterial transcriptional regulators, which bind at or very near the promoter, sigma-54 activators bind 100­ 150 bp upstream of the promoter.17 In the absence of a stimulatory signal, sigma-54 activators are inactive dimers that are unable to hydrolyze ATP or initiate transcription. Upon receiving a stimulatory signal, which is phosphorylation for the NtrC family of proteins discussed here, the activators form catalytically active ATPases that are ring-shaped oligomers. 18­21 Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain induces a conformational change22­24 that enables assembly of the ATPase subunits. Assembled oligomers contact sigma-54 and use ATP hydrolysis to drive a conformational change in the polymerase holoenzyme­DNA complex to a state that is competent for initiation. Sigma-54 activators generally have an N-terminal domain that regulates assembly.16 The activators discussed in this work have N-terminal receiver domains that regulate ATPase assembly, but many activator proteins use other types of domains such as GAF or PAS domains.16 Regulation is termed negative if inactive-state interactions repress ATPase assembly, and is termed positive if active-state interactions facilitate ATPase assembly.14,25­27 The central ATPase domains of positively regulated activators are intrinsically incompetent for assembly without the aid of an activated receiver domain. The central ATPase domains of negatively regulated activators are competent for assembly, and the regulatory domain must repress assembly in the inactive dimeric state.14,25­27 Surprisingly, activators using these two distinct mechanisms have a high level of sequence homology through all three domains. Activators with well-characterized mechanisms of action include NtrC from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which is positively

regulated,25,26 and NtrC1 from Aquifex aeolicus14,28,29 and DctD from S. meliloti,27 which are negatively regulated. Primary sequence analysis of NtrC, NtrC1, and DctD identified motifs related to structural features that seem to distinguish between the two regulatory mechanisms.14 NtrC4, another sigma-54 activator from A. aeolicus, has some sequence motifs associated with each mechanism, suggesting a hybrid regulatory mechanism. Here we present structural and biochemical data for NtrC4 showing that it is negatively regulated but has mechanistic features distinct from those of NtrC1. These data indicate that NtrC4 is functionally an evolutionary intermediate between the negative mechanism of DctD/ NtrC1 and the positive mechanism of NtrC. These studies provide new insights into variations in regulatory mechanism within this class of proteins and show a likely evolutionary pathway between mechanisms.

Results
For convenience, we will refer to domains of NtrC family proteins using the following: R domain for the N-terminal regulatory receiver domain, C domain for the central ATPase domain, and D domain for the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Sequence comparison of NtrC4 with other activators A comparison of the sequence of NtrC4 with those of NtrC and NtrC1 (Fig. 1), together with the structures of the domains from these proteins, identified sequence motifs that seemed to discriminate between positive and negative modes of

1061 the receiver domain and R-C linker lead us to think that the NtrC4 mechanism might be distinct from both NtrC and NtrC1/DctD, and structural and functional studies were undertaken. NtrC4's central domain is intrinsically competent for assembly and ATP hydrolysis We performed ATPase activity assays on unac- tivated NtrC4-RCD, Mg2 +­BeF3 -activated NtrC4RCD, and NtrC4-CD constructs. Binding of Mg2 +­ - BeF3 to receiver domains mimics the effects of phosphorylation.14,22­24 To become enzymatically active, AAA proteins must assemble into an oligomer so that a key "arginine finger" from one subunit is brought into the active site of its neighbor to complete the catalytic machinery.30 Active hexamers and heptamers have been found for AAA domains from sigma-54 activators (and a pentamer for a

regulation.14 These motifs include the following: (1) a conserved residue pattern, termed "GHG motif" (TGHGXXXXVXX, where  = hydrophobic aliphatic), that forms the dimer interface between activated receiver domains in negatively regulated proteins; (2) a coiled-coil linker between the receiver domain and the central domain for negatively regulated proteins, but a shorter unstructured linker for positively regulated proteins; and (3) a short linker between the central domain and the DNAbinding domain for negatively regulated proteins, and a longer C-D linker for positively regulated proteins. This alignment (Fig. 1) shows that NtrC4 has the active dimerization interface motif, suggesting a negative regulatory mechanism; however, the R-C linker is short and incompatible with coiled coil, indicating a positive mechanism. The C-D linker is shorter than NtrC, but not quite as short as NtrC1 and hence is ambiguous. The conflicting indicators in

The results show that all three constructs become maximally active at protein concentrations above 1 M, but that unactivated NtrC4-RCD has a lower activity than - NtrC4-CD or BeF3 -activated NtrC4-RCD. These data indicate that the unactivated regulatory domain

represses the assembly of this protein, although much less strongly than the previously studied negatively regulated NtrC1 and DctD.14,26 Solution structures of unactivated and activated NtrC4-R To determine whether NtrC4's receiver domain forms an active dimer, as predicted by the sequence motif and as seen for the negatively regulated

solutions with a low buffer concentration and without added salt at 40 °C, we obtained good spectra, and most of the residues in the protein could be assigned. Analytical centrifugation showed that the receiver domain is monomeric under these buffer conditions (Table 3). Structures

The structure statistics are shown in Table 1, and the coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; code 1ZIT). The final ensemble of 38 structures is shown in Fig. 3. - Following a Mg2 +­BeF3 titration with 1H­15N HSQC spectra, we found that 1 mM NtrC4-R was fully activated by first adding 4 mM MgCl2 and then adding premixed BeCl2 and NaF to final concentrations of 1 mM and 6 mM, respectively. Many peaks shifted relative to the inactive form in - the presence of BeF3 , and several new peaks appeared from residues in the -helix 4 region, probably due to decreased conformational exchange in this region.22,23 Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that, in contrast to the monomeric unactivated receiver domain, the activated receiver domain is dimeric in solution. To solve the structure of the activated receiver domain dimer, both backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned using standard 3D NMR techniques (Table 1). Residues at the dimer interface were identified in half-filtered NOESYexperiments38 (Fig. 4). 1H­15N residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints collected in the presence of phage to cause alignment were used to refine the relative orientation of the two monomers. The structure statistics are shown in Table 1, and the coordinates have been deposited in the PDB (code 2JRL). The final ensemble of 20 structures is shown in Fig. 5. NtrC4's DNA-binding domain is a helix­turn­helix-containing dimer To investigate the behavior of the DNA-binding domain of NtrC4, we expressed a construct beginning with the C-D linker residues, analogous to that used for structural studies of NtrC.39 Analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that this domain is dimeric in solution. NtrC4-D was crystallized, and diffraction data up to 2.25 Å were collected. The structure was refined to an Rwork of 20.3% and an Rfree of 24.3% (Table 2). The

structure is relatively similar to that of NtrC-D, which comprised four helices, with three helices forming a classical helix­turn­helix motif for DNA recognition and with the fourth helix supporting dimer formation with a buried surface area of 1800 Å2 (Fig. 6). Details of this structure will be discussed in another work. For this work, the significant conclusion is that this domain is a stable dimer. Negative-stain electron microscopy images show that NtrC4-CD forms heptamer rings The oligomeric stoichiometry of assembled threedomain response regulators is an open question. There have been reports of six-membered25,31 and seven-membered28 rings for different proteins in this family, and five-membered 32 rings for a response regulator in which the "ATPase" seems to have lost activity. Negatively stained electron microscopy (EM) images of NtrC4-CD show that the dominant form in solution is an assembled oligomer, consistent with activity data at the protein concentrations used to prepare the EM samples (Fig. 2). Refined class averages of particles were generated from the EM images and showed primarily heptameric rings (Fig. 7). The calculated cross-correlation coefficient40 has a strong peak centered on a 7-fold symmetry. The isolated central domain of the NtrC1 homolog from the same organism also forms heptameric rings characterized in crystallographic studies and verified in solution.28,29 EM studies of NtrC4-RCD were unsuccessful. Oligomers seemed to dissociate at low concentrations necessary for separated molecules on the grid. Crystal structure of NtrC4-RC shows dimerization of R and C domains To determine how NtrC4's N-terminal domain represses the attached ATPase domain, we solved the crystal structure of the inactive NtrC4-RC fragment. NtrC4-RC crystallized with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data

were phased using molecular replacement with individual domains of NtrC1, as discussed in Materials and Methods. The R-C linker had weak electron density that was clearly visible in difference maps, and all of the residues could be fitted into the density. The final model was refined at a resolution of 2.4 Å, with an Rwork of 21.4% and an Rfree of 26.2% (Table 2). This model is shown in Fig. 8. NtrC4-RC forms a homodimer with contacts between each domain: R to R, C to C, and R to C. The overall structure of NtrC4-RC is very similar to the unactivated state of NtrC1-RC, although there are small differences in the positions of the receiver domains with respect to the ATPase domains. The individual receiver and central domains of NtrC1 and NtrC4 have r.m.s.d. values of 1.10 Å and 1.37 Å respectively, but intact NtrC1-RC and NtrC4-RC do not align as well because the relative orientation of the receiver and central domains is slightly rotated. The most significant difference between NtrC4-RC and NtrC1-RC is the loss of the C-terminal portion of the long helix 5 from the receiver domain of NtrC1. In NtrC4, the long coiled coil has been replaced by a short unstructured connector (Fig. 8).

This change substantially reduces the buried surface area in the NtrC4-RC dimer (1600 Å2/monomer) compared to that in the inactive NtrC1-RC dimer (2200 Å2/monomer). Sequence comparisons of the R-C linker regions from NtrC4-like proteins We used sequence analysis to determine how often unstructured NtrC4-like, coiled-coil NtrC1like, and other helical linkers occur in the region connecting R and C domains. As of September 15, 2007, there were 1464 NtrC-type sigma-54 activator proteins (i.e., containing homologous R, C, and D domains) in the pfam database. We selected 612 sequences with the conserved GHG motif, which are predicted to be sufficient for identifying formation of dimers by the activated regulatory domain that are analogous to NtrC4-R, DctD-R, and NtrC1-R.14 We defined linker residues as those from NtrC4's F117-V133, corresponding to NtrC1's I116-V140. In this set of 612 sequences, we found 74 sequences with a putative coiled-coil structure (like NtrC1) and 138 sequences with no predicted

Seventy-four linker sequences have a putative coiled-coil structure and are predicted to be like NtrC1. Four hundred linker sequences have a partial helical structure, which is not a coiled coil and is predicted have an intermediate phenotype.

1067 found in other dimeric response regulators such as FixJ that lack the helix 5 extension.41 The homodimer interface between NtrC4's C domains is also very similar to that in NtrC1.14,28 The positions of the receiver domains relative to the central domains are somewhat different in NtrC4, probably reflecting the loss of interactions from the helical extension that play a major role in positioning the R dimer relative to the C dimer in NtrC1. The relative ease of activation of NtrC4 can be explained, at least in part, by the paucity of interactions in the R-C linker of NtrC4 relative to NtrC1, in which an extended helix 5 dimer precisely docks with the C domain dimer.28 The density from the linker region in NtrC4 is less well-defined than other parts of the structure with high loop-like Bfactors, implying flexibility of this region, and weakened intramolecular and intermolecular interactions between the R domain and the C domain. This apparently flexible linker between the regulatory domain and the ATPase domain helps explain our activity assays, showing that NtrC4's off state only relatively weakly represses activation. Conformational changes in NtrC4's receiver domain upon activation
- Phosphorylation of receiver domains or BeF3 binding at the active site results in a conformational change that remodels one surface of the domain.42 A key element in this change is the change in position of a conserved threonine residue (T80 in NtrC4) in the 4­4 loop to hydrogen bond with the - phosphate (or BeF3 ). This position change of the threonine side chain alone would lead to a cavity-- hence other residues rearrange, leading to a remodeled 4­5 surface of the domain. A comparison of the structure of the receiver domain dimer in the inactive R-C crystal structure with the NMR structure of the activated receiver domain shows that the side chain of F99 (a position conserved as Y or F) is rotated inward to fill the space left by the side chain of T80 upon activation. F99 is in the interface between receiver domains in the inactive RC dimer; however, in the active dimer, the phenylalanine side chain is rotated away from the interface and makes strictly intramolecular contacts. This rearrangement leads to reorganization of the dimer interface to include interactions involving the GHG motif, including residues V85, V89, and I92 (Fig. 10). In receiver domains with determined structures, this GHG motif has been found in the active-state intermolecular interface (DctD, 1L5Y; NtrC1, 1ZY2; FixJ, 1D5W; CheY-like JF-1, 3CRN), analogous to what is found for NtrC4. Receiver domains that do not have this motif are found to associate through distinct parts of the structure or not at all. The sigma54 activators with this motif have been found to undergo similar structural changes upon activation and seem likely to have related mechanisms of regulation.41­43 However, there are undoubtedly other structures and structural changes that could lead to negative regulatory mechanisms.

upon activation.18,20,21 The transition between these states is generally controlled by N-terminal regulatory domains.16 In the NtrC protein family, receiver domains serve as the regulatory domain and are activated by phosphorylation. It has been shown that receiver domains can control assembly either positively25,26 or negatively.14,27,28 Structural studies of the activation mechanisms of NtrC, NtrC1, and DctD lead to identification of sequence differences that appear to predict the activation mechanism. When the sequence of NtrC4 (a homolog of NtrC1 from the same thermophilic organism) was analyzed, there were regions of the sequence indicating negative regulation, but there were others suggesting positive regulation. To determine which was correct or whether NtrC4 uses a new regulatory mechanism, we undertook structural and biochemical studies of NtrC4 and its domains. NtrC4 is a negatively regulated response regulator ATPase assays show that unactivated NtrC4- RCD is less active than either the BeF3 -activated NtrC4-RCD or the unregulated NtrC4-CD (Fig. 2), with the most pronounced differences at low concentrations closer to what would be present in cells. This indicates that the regulatory domain represses assembly of the active oligomer, defining NtrC4's regulatory mode as negative. Furthermore, - NtrC4-CD and BeF3 -activated NtrC4-RCD have indistinguishable activities within the error of the experiment. This shows that the central domain is fully competent for spontaneous assembly, and that the activated receiver domain does not stabilize the oligomer, again consistent with negative regulation. Although these data indicate a negative mechanism, they do not explain why unactivated NtrC4 has ATPase activity at high protein concentrations or how the regulatory domain represses assembly given that sequence analysis indicates that the coiled coil region, which is centrally involved in the R-C domain interface of NtrC1, is missing. The structural studies of NtrC4 domains presented here, however, provide insight into these issues. NtrC4-RC's structure is quite similar to that of NtrC1-RC The crystal structure of NtrC4-RC provides the architecture of the inactive state. Since the sequence alignment shows a deletion of eight residues between the R and C domains and the presence of a proline­proline pair in NtrC4 that is incompatible with a helix, we anticipated an organization of domains different from that seen for NtrC1. However, this structure shows that the long helix 5 of NtrC1-R has simply been replaced by an extended chain to bridge approximately the same distance to the ATPase domain. The receiver domains have the same basic dimer interface seen in NtrC1, which is

1069 sigma-54 activators adopt a common active-state structure upon phosphorylation. ATPases from two other mesophilic sigma-54 activators, ZraR-CD45 and PspF-C,31 are also hexamers. On the other hand, pentamers have been reported for the isolated central domain of HupR-C,32 although it is reported to be inactive as an ATPase. To date, among sigma-54 activators, only NtrC has been characterized as a full-length protein containing all three domains. Truncation of the AAA ATPase CamKII has been shown to affect the stoichiometry of its assembled AAA ring.46 CamKII consists of a regulatory segment and a kinase domain N-terminal to the C-terminal AAA domain. 47,48 Full-length CamKII forms doubly stacked rings with six subunits; however, the isolated AAA ATPase domain forms doubly stacked heptameric rings.46 The isolated AAA domains of A. aeolicus NtrC1 and NtrC4 are both active ATPases; however, it is possible that they behave like CamKII, and active-state regulatory domain interactions promote 6-fold stoichiometry in vivo, although we have found no direct experimental evidence to date. The dominant dimerization determinant of sigma-54 activators does not correlate with the regulatory mechanism A majority of bacterial-sequence-specific DNAbinding domains are dimeric and bind to pseudopalindromic DNA sequences, providing high affinity and specificity.49 All of the sigma-54 activators studied to date have a dimeric off state. For S. enterica NtrC, the C-terminal DNA-binding domain forms a stable dimer in isolation from the other domains and is responsible for dimer formation of the full-length protein.50 It is known that interactions of the AAA domains of NtrC are weak, requiring additional interactions with receiver domains to assemble into an active ring.25 On the other hand, studies of A. aeolicus NtrC1 showed that the inactive R and C domains dimerize with an extensive interaction surface.26 Accordingly, NtrC1's C-terminal DNA-binding domain need not play a role in dimerization because its Nterminal receiver domain forms a tight dimer. Indeed, NtrC1's C-terminal DNA-binding domain does not form a stable dimer in solution, although there are interactions that lead to cooperative DNA binding (Maris and Wemmer et al., unpublished data). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments show that NtrC4-RCD exists as a dimer (Table 3), but it was not apparent what part of NtrC4 would be responsible for dimerization. Although the crystal structure of NtrC4-RC is dimeric, the dimer interface is substantially reduced relative to NtrC1 because of the loss of the extended helix 5 of the R domain. The

A feature that distinguishes NtrC4 from other structurally characterized, negatively regulated activators is that NtrC4's unactivated receiver domain is not a stable dimer. Our NMR studies indicate that the conformation of the inactive monomeric receiver domain alone is intermediate between the inactive conformation and the active conformation. Relative to its position in the RC dimer, T80 in the receiver domain has been displaced from its interior position by F99 packing into the interior as in the activated conformation. - However, since there is no phosphate (or BeF3 ) present at the active site, T80 and K102 cannot complete their active-site interactions, leaving the nearby loops poorly ordered and exchanging between inactive and active-like conformations. This conformation has features analogous to a "meta-active" conformation of CheY seen in a high-resolution crystal structure,44 although this is a significantly populated minor conformer for CheY whereas it is dominant for NtrC4. Both DctD and NtrC1 have a long helix 5 that forms a coiled-coil (or a crossed helical pair) interaction and contributes significantly to dimer stability, as well as forms part of the packing interface with the central domains.15,28 This coiled coil and its contributions to the stability of the dimeric off state are missing in NtrC4. The isolated receiver domains of both DctD and NtrC1 are dimeric in both "on" and "off" states with different dimer interfaces. In the context of the full-length offstate NtrC4 protein, the combined interactions of the R and C domains lead to the dimeric structure of RC (Fig. 8). However, the fact that this interface can be disrupted to form the active oligomer of the C domain just by increasing concentration (deduced from the enzyme activity data; Fig. 2)--a process that does not happen with NtrC1--reinforces the idea that the "off" R domain dimer contributes only little to the stability of the full-length protein's off state. Stoichiometry of the central ATPase ring Analysis of EM images shows clearly that that NtrC4-CD forms heptameric rings. Heptamers were also found for the isolated central domain of NtrC1C, 28 another NtrC homolog from A. aeolicus. Although NtrC4-CD is heptameric, it is possible that activated NtrC4-RCD is a hexamer, consistent with a stable dimeric activated NtrC4-R. The assembled active form of S. enterica NtrC-RCD was found to be hexameric.25 NtrC is positively regulated, and the active form is stabilized by an interaction between a receiver domain and the neighboring ATPase in the ring,26 which could play a role in defining the active-state stoichiometry. It is not known whether the AAA domains of all

ATPase domain so much that ATPase activity was apparent even without phosphorylation (Fig. 2). In contrast, full-length NtrC1 with its coiled-coil linker - required high levels of BeF3 to observe ATPase 14 activity. Under the conditions reported here for NtrC4 ATPase assays, NtrC1 has no detectable ATPase activity. Intermediate changes to the linker may result in repression levels between those observed for NtrC4 and those observed for NtrC1. Further experimental work on activators with a range of predicted helices will be needed to verify this hypothesis. NtrC4 has the characteristics of an evolutionary intermediate between NtrC1 and NtrC Identification of very different regulatory mechanisms for NtrC1 and NtrC raises the question of how evolution might have converted one into the other. The features that we have described here for NtrC4 have many characteristics that one might expect in an evolutionary "intermediate" in this process. The interfaces between NtrC4's receiver domains, and those between NtrC4's receiver and ATPase domains, have been weakened relative to NtrC1 or DctD by sequence changes that truncate helix 5 of the receiver domain. At the same time, interactions between DNA-binding domains have been strengthened so that the overall protein remains dimeric, as is needed for efficient DNA binding. From NtrC4, one can imagine that only a few more mutations are needed to eliminate all R-C interactions in the off state (since they are already rather weak) and to weaken the spontaneous assembly of the isolated ATPase. If the activated receiver domain then gains an interaction with the ATPase, stimulating assembly of the active ATPase ring, the conversion of mechanism from negative regulation into positive regulation would be essentially complete. These observations fit nicely with the idea that it is easier to evolve physically linked domains than fully independent ones to alter their function because proximity reduces the strength of interactions required for function.51 The observation that both NtrC1 (which is very stable in its "off" state and is difficult to activate in vitro) and NtrC4 (which is marginally stable in its "off" state, actives easily, and perhaps has some constitutive activities) are in the same organism suggests rather different regulatory roles for these proteins. Unfortunately, since relatively little is known about the cellular physiology of A. aeolicus and the specific roles of the gene products regulated by the sigma-54 activators, we cannot currently explain the need for such differences. The results presented here do, however, show that there is more diversity in the regulation of the sigma-54 activators than previously recognized. Future directions Structural and biochemical studies of the receiver domain containing sigma-54 activators have

observed spontaneous assembly of NtrC4 at high concentration indicates that the RC dimer is only marginally stable; hence, it is not surprising to find that the DNA-binding domain of NtrC4 has taken over the role of primary dimerization determinant. This change appears to require only a modest alteration of the structure. A discussion of the details of the NtrC1 and NtrC4 DNA-binding domain structures and how they correlate with dimer stability will be presented elsewhere. Although a comparison of NtrC and NtrC1 suggested that dimerization of the DNA-binding domain might be a distinguishing characteristic of the positive regulation mechanism, the data presented here for NtrC4 show that this is not the case. However, since formation of a stable DNA-binding domain dimer does seem to be correlated with the strength of interaction of other domains, this characteristic may still be a useful indicator for aspects of activation mechanism. Sequence motifs that may predict regulatory mechanism Structural studies showed that the coiled-coil R-C linker region of NtrC1 and DctD plays a central role in repressing assembly in a negatively regulated response regulator.14,15,28 From the sequence of NtrC4, it was clear that this feature could not be present, leading us to consider whether it might function through a different mechanism. The studies described here indicate that NtrC4's receiver domain weakly represses assembly (Fig. 2), but that the overall mechanism is rather similar to that of NtrC1. To determine how many sigma-54 activators might operate with similar mechanisms, we analyzed the sequences of linker regions of response regulators whose receiver domains contain the conserved "GHG" motif thought to be critical for activated receiver domain dimerization.14 Among these, 12% have a predicted coiled-coil R-C linker similar to NtrC1 and DctD, 22.5% have a predicted unstructured linker similar to NtrC4, and the majority (65.5%) have variable amounts of helical structure but are not predicted to form a coiled coil (Fig. 9). This result suggests that variation in a response regulator's R-C linker region may be used to tune activators, with some being much easier to activate than others. For NtrC4, replacing much of helix 5 with a flexible unstructured connector weakened the receiver domain's repression of the

exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by size-exclusion chromatography using Sephadex-75 (Amersham Biosciences). The purified NtrC4-R was concentrated to 1 mM in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Activity assays Samples (250 l) of NtrC4-CD and NtrC4-RCD at concentrations between 2  M and 100 nM were incubated at 70 °C for 5 min. Then, 50 l of 24 mM ATP was added to the samples for a final ATP concentration of 4 mM. At various time points, 50-l aliquots were quenched with 350 l of 0.88 M HNO3. A color-developing solution (350 l) consisting of 44 M Bi(NO 3 ) 2 , 31.1 M (NH4)6Mo7O24, and 0.11% ascorbic acid was added to the quenched reactions. Exactly 3 min after the addition of color-developing solution, absorbance at 700 nm, which is proportional to the amount of free phosphate in solution, was measured.53 Analytical ultracentrifugation

provided clear ideas about how phosphorylation leads to assembly of the active oligomers. Different activators share common features, but their details are surprisingly and substantially diverse. Insights gained from these studies will enable design of experiments to efficiently test the regulatory mechanisms in other activators. In vivo studies are required to fully understand the functional significance of activators that are difficult or easy to activate. Such studies can build on this work by exploring the effects of systematic variations in the activators on gene expression. One might eventually use these principles to fine-tune synthetic regulatory networks. Further studies are also needed to determine the extent of interdomain interactions in the activated oligomers of these proteins and their functional roles.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification A. aeolicus genomic DNA was a gift from R. Huber (Lehrstuhl fur Mikrobiologie, Universität Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany). NtrC4-RCD was cloned from genomic DNA into a PSKB3 plasmid, which has an Nterminal His6 tag. From the NtrC4-RCD plasmid, we subcloned NtrC4-R (residues 1­121), NtrC4-D (residues 366­442), and NtrC4-CD (residues 131­442) into pET21a vectors (Pharmacia Biotech). We subcloned NtrC4-RC (residues 1­373) into a PSKB3 plasmid, and NtrC4-C (residues 131­378) into a pET21b3-2 plasmid (Pharmacia Biotech), which has a C-terminal His6 tag. All plasmids were sequenced at the University of California at Berkeley sequencing facility and found to have no cloning artifacts. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with a Rosetta.pLysS plasmid. NtrC4-RCD, NtrC4-CD, and NtrC4-RC were expressed using Studier's autoinduction protocol.52 NMR samples of NtrC4-R were prepared by growing cells at 37 °C in 1 l of isotope-labeled M9 minimal media. NtrC4-R, NtrC4-C, and NtrC4-D were expressed by growing cells in Luria­Bertani media to an optical density of 0.6­0.8, induced with 1 mM isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested after 4­6 h. Cells expressing the desired construct were resuspended in 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mM PMSF with one Roche Complete ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) (NtrC4-CD and NtrC4RCD); 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mM PMSF (NtrC4-RC); 250 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaHPO4 (pH 6.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM PMSF (NtrC4-D); and 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.1), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.05% sodium azide (NtrC4-R). Cells were harvested by sonication, and lysates were heated for 30 min at 85 °C (NtrC4-D) or 75 °C (all others). NtrC4RCD, NtrC4-RC, and NtrC4-C were run over a Ni-agarose column, eluted with 300 mM imidazole, and then dialyzed overnight in their respective lysis buffers. NtrC4-D, NtrC4-CD, and NtrC4-RCD were further purified using a heparin column and eluted with a NaCl gradient. For the BeF--activated studies, NtrC4-R was purified using a Q3 Sepharose column and a prep-grade Superdex-75 gelfiltration column. For the unactivated studies, NtrC4-R was purified by running cell lysate over a DEAE ionSedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Various constructs were dialyzed exhaustively against their respective buffers, as described above. Data were acquired using six-hole cells at an average of three absorbance measurements at 280 nm and with a radial spacing of 0.001 cm. Sedimentation equilibrium was achieved within 48 h. Data collected at different speeds and different loading concentrations were analyzed in various analysis models using UltraScan Analysis 8.054 to obtain buoyant molecular mass. Electron microscopy NtrC4-CD samples [10 mg/ml, 700 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.5), and 10% glycerol] were diluted 100-fold and adsorbed onto a freshly glow-discharged carbon film support mounted on 200-mesh EM grids. After 1 min, the samples were stained with uranyl-acetate (3%) for 30 s, blotted, and air-dried. Electron micrographs were collected at 0° on a Tecnai 12 electron microscope (FEI) operated at 120 kV, with a calibrated magnification of 49,687× and defocus ranging from 1.0 mm to 1.5 mm. Astigmatism-free and drift-free micrographs were digitized using a Nikon Super Coolscan ED8000 scanner at 2.56 Å/pixel (at specimen scale). Particles were semiautomatically picked and extracted from the micrographs using EMAN.55 Using SPIDER,56 125 × 125-pixel windows were passed through a 22-Å Fermi low-pass filter to remove all information beyond the first contrast transfer function zero, but contrast transfer function correction was otherwise not applied. Initial class averages, obtained with translational alignment but without rotational alignment or symmetry, were subjected to four to five cycles of multivariate statistical analysis using 16 eigenfactors and avoiding a 7-fold symmetry bias, followed by hierarchical ascendant classification using Ward's criterion57 and two-dimensional (2D) alignment (for both rotation and translation). NMR spectroscopy of unactivated NtrC4-R Backbone assignments were obtained primarily from HNCA, HNHA, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, C(CCO)

NH, H(CCO)NH, and HCCH-total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments recorded at 50 °C, and from HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, and 15N-separated TOCSY experiments recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe as described previously.39,58,59 Some assignments and the majority of structural restraints were obtained from 15Nseparated NOESY spectra recorded on Bruker DRX 600 and Bruker DRX 800 spectrometers at both 25 °C and 50 °C, and from a 13C-separated NOESY spectrum recorded on a Bruker DRX 600 at 50 °C. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe60 and analyzed using NMRView.61 Backbone NH signals were assigned for all residues except Lys2, Ser12, Val78, Gly81, His82, Gly83, Ser84, Val85, and Phe99, and complete side-chain assignments were obtained for all residues except Met1, Glu11, Lys40, Met55, Gly81, His82, Gly83, Ser84, Lys93, Lys94, and Lys102. Chemical shift assignments have been deposited with the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank under accession number BMRB-6611. NOEs identified in 3D 15N-separated and 13C-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra were classified as strong (1.8­2.5 Å; 1.8­2.9 Å for NOEs involving NH signals), medium (1.3­ 3.3 Å), or weak (1.8­5.0 Å), as described previously.39,59 Phi-angle restraints were derived from 3JHNH coupling constants obtained from an HNHA spectrum.62 Phi-angle restraints were constrained to -60 ± 30° for a 3JHNH of less than 5 Hz, and to -170 ± 50° for a 3JHNH of greater than 8 Hz. Stereospecific assignments of Val and Leu methyl groups were obtained by recording a 2D [13C]HSQC spectrum of NtrC4-R labeled with 13C glucose at the 10% level.63 Chi-1 angles for Thr, Val, and Ile residues were obtained by measuring 3 J NC and 3 J CC coupling constants.64,65 RDC restraints were measured by comparing the results of in-phase antiphase HSQC spectra,66 with the protein dissolved in either 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer or a 5% wt/vol solution of 1,2-dimyristoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine at a molar ratio of 3.0:1 at 45 °C. DYANA67 was used for initial structure calculations. CNS68 was used for final rounds that included 1H­15N residual dipolar restraints. Once the backbone r.m.s.d. fell below 1.0 Å, hydrogen-bond restraints were added for those amide protons with slow exchange (with protection factors greater than 80) and short HN­O distances. Structures were viewed and analyzed with MOLMOL.69 Thirty-eight of 100 structures with the lowest energies were selected to represent the structure. Coordinates have been deposited with the PDB under accession number 1ZIT. NMR spectroscopy of activated NtrC4-R BeF- activation was completed by adding 3  l of 3 mixture (380 mM MgCl2, 80 mM BeCl2, and 500 mM NaF) to 270  l of NMR sample concentrated to 1.0 mM. Isotopefiltered NOESY experiment samples were created by mixing the nonlabeled and isotope-labeled proteins in a 1:1 ratio and by activating with BeF-. (BeFx is toxic and 3 must be handled with due care.) Aligned RDC NMR samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized BeF-3 activated NtrC4-R in 20 mg/ml Pf1 phage solution (ALSA Biotech). NMR data were collected at 298 K on Bruker DRX 600 , Avance 800, or Avance 900 spectrometers equipped with x,y,z-shielded gradient triple-resonance probe or a z-shielded gradient triple-resonance cryoprobe (800). All data were processed with NMRPipe60 and analyzed with SPARKY.70 Backbone assignments were

Mechanism of Aquifex aeolicus NtrC4 obtained using the 3D triple-resonance experiments HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and [15N]NOESY-HSQC. Three-dimensional HBHA(CO) NH, C(CCCO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra were used for side-chain assignments. NOE distance constraints were derived from 3D [15N] NOESY-HSQC and [13C]NOESY-HSQC, both with 100-ms mixing times. Dihedral backbone restraints were derived from 1H, 13C, 13C, and 13CO chemical shifts using the program TALOS.71 Protected amides were identified through their slowed hydrogen exchange after transfer into D2O. Intermolecular distance restraints were determined from 3D [F1] 13C-edited, [F3] 13C-filtered NOESYHSQC with 100-ms mixing times. 1DNH RDCs were collected from the 3D IPAP-J-HNCO experiment based on transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy, as well as from the 2D 1H­15N IPAP-HSQC experiment. Initial structure calculations were performed using CYANA 2.2,67,72 with 32 (64 when considering the symmetry-related ones) manually assigned intermolecular NOE restraints as input data. One hundred fifty additional intermolecular NOE restraints were obtained from automatically assigned peaks of 3D [13C]NOESYHSQC as output data of CYANA calculation. The structures were refined with the acquired 1H­15N RDC data. The magnitude (A = 19.21) and rhombicity ( = 0.51) of the alignment tensor were obtained initially from a powder pattern distribution of the 1DNH data73 and subsequently adjusted to values (A = 20.876 ± 0.002;  = 0.486 ± 0.002) obtained through the refinement process. Twenty RDC-refined structures were used for structural analysis. The Protein Structure Validation Software server33 was used to check the protein stereochemical geometry. Coordinates have been deposited in the PDB as accession number 2JRL. NtrC4-RC crystallization and structure determination Crystals of NtrC4-RC were grown at room temperature using hanging-drop vapor diffusion. One microliter of protein solution (15 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of well solution containing 5% (vol/vol) polyethylene glycol 4000 and 100 mM citric acid (pH 4.6). Crystals appeared after 1 day. They grew to  0.5 mm × 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm after 2 weeks and were diamond-shaped. Twenty-four hours before data collection, 5 M NaCl was added to the wells to a final concentration of 1. 5 M NaCl. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. These crystals belonged to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of 89.9 Å × 93.1 Å × 114.2 Å and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at beamline 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The data were processed and scaled with MOSFLM74 and the CCP4 program suite75 using the ELVES interface.76 Phases were initially obtained by molecular replacement with PHASER77 using residues 142­384 of the inactive NtrC1-RC monomer (PDB accession number 1NY5). PHASER was initially unable to locate the receiver domains, so we used FFEAR78 to find real space fits for these smaller domains. PHASER was able to locate a receiver domain when we used the two central domains and a real space receiver domain as the first search model, and a FFEAR solution for a single receiver domain as the second search model. The amino-acid sequence was rebuilt using RESOLVE in PHENIX.79 The amino-acid sequence was fitted to the electron density map using Coot.80 Refinement was performed with phenix.

NtrC4-D crystallization and structure determination Crystals of NtrC4-D were grown at 4 °C using hangingdrop vapor diffusion. Two microliters of protein solution (15 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of well solution containing 10 mM CdSO4, 20% polyethylene glycol 550 MME, and 100 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.5). These crystals were trapezoidal and grew to  0.2 mM × 0.2 mM × 0.6 mM in 4 days. Crystals were cryoprotected at 4 °C by adding 25% methylpentanediol to the drop in steps of 2%. The drop equilibrated for 10 min between steps. Crystals were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Data sets were taken at beamlines 8.2.2 and 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
