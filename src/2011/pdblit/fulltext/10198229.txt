The first three-dimensional structure of the ribosome inactivating protein mistletoe lectin I (ML-I) from Viscum album has been modeled on the basis of the X-ray structure of castor bean ricin from Ricinus communis. The relative high sequence homology and conserved secondary structure enabled accurate modeling. The 196 sequence changes between ML-I and ricin could be accomodated with only little pertubation in the main chain folding. A close comparison of the primary structures of ML-I and ricin is given and the effects of the sequence changes are elucidated on the basis of the modeled three-dimensional structure. Differences have been identified in the vicinity of the active site, in the high affinity galactose binding site and in the interface between the A and B chains, which might account for the reduced cytotoxicity of ML-I. 1998 Academic Press

Mistletoe lectin is a ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) of type II like ricin and abrin [1]. Although these extremely toxic proteins are of different phylogenetic origin they share similar activities and structural properties, being potent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis at the ribosomal level [2]. The heterodimeric RIP's of type II comprise a highly specific A subunit which exhibits RNA N-glycosidase activity and is associated with a galactoside-specific lectin as B subunit. The B subunit binds to cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids, thereby facilitating penetration of the toxic A chain to the cytosol and promoting subsequent ribosome inactivation. Unlike ricin, ML-I is medically applied as a compoTo whom correspondence should be addressed. Fax: /49 40 89984747. E-mail: Betzel@unisgi1.desy.de.

nent of a commercially available mistletoe extract with immunostimulating potency for the treatment of human cancer [3]. In vitro and in vivo studies on animals and humans gave the indications that nontoxic doses of ML-I cause a significant increase and activation of natural killer cells and enhance phagocytic activity of granulocytes and monocytes [4,5]. It also could be demonstrated recently that cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with ML-I lead to the expansion and activation of T cells [6]. T lymphocyte subset analysis revealed that ML-I preferentially stimulates and expands CD8/ T cells mediating the cytotoxic effect. Combined activation of PBL with ML-I and the lymphokine IL-2 results in simultaneous induction of T and CD56/ cell-mediated cytotoxicity [6]. Such effects of ML-I on cells of the immune system are at present time intensively studied in in vitro test systems, animal experiments [7] and human trials [8] and their therapeutical benefit is under evaluation [9]. These results from the test phase of ML-I prompted us to put efforts to analyse the primary and threedimensional structure of ML-I. As no primary structure of the glycoprotein ML I was available, we isolated the lectin from an aqueous mistletoe extract as described previously [10]. The complete amino acid sequences of the A subunit [10-12] and the B chain [13, 14] of ML-I have been determined and compared with the primary structure of the functional closely related ricin [15]. Ricin is the first representative of the RIP II class toxins for which a molecular model based on X-ray diffraction data has been derived [16, 17]. This structure is likely to represent the basic architecture of the entire group and was therefore used as template for the model building study presented in this paper. Model building studies between related proteins are a potential tool in understanding which residues are essential for structure and function and thus in rationalizing biological and medical activities of drugs on a structural basis.

cially in the region of deletions, insertions and towards the chain termini, was done employing the program systems FRODO [19] and WHATIF [20]. For alignment of the replaced side chains optimization of polar and hydrophobic interactions was taken as a guide line. The final ML-I model was checked by the program PROCHECK [21], yielding 94 % of the backbone conformations within the most favoured and additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Comparison of the sequence of ML-I with that of the closely related ricin [15], Fig. 1, reveals the high homology between the two RIP II complexes. The A chain is with 41 % identity significantly less conserved than the B chain with 64 % identity. The 196 sequence differ-

ences between ML-I and ricin could be accomodated with only little pertubation in the main chain folding, Fig. 2, which follows closely that described for ricin [16]. While the A chain is composed of both, a and b secundary structure elements, in the B chain only b sheets are found. Each of the globular domains of the B chain consist of a so-called linker domain and three homologous subdomains, Fig. 2a. Most of the radical sequence changes are located at the surface of the molecule or in solvent accessible surface crevices. In buried regions of the molecule radical replacements mostly occur in clusters of several mutations which allow the compensation of the introduced changes in charge, hydrophobicity or volume.

tions and deletions cluster in loop regions on the surface of the molecule with the only exception of the deletions in positions 104 and 105 of the ML-I A chain, which truncate the short second a helix in domain I of the subunit, Fig. 2. Like ricin, the A chain ML-I is supposed to excise a specific adenine base from a highly conserved loop region of 28S rRNA [22]. The catalytic key residues Tyr81A, Tyr124A, Glu178A, Arg181A and Trp212A for the N-glycosidase activity are completely conserved in terms of sequence and spatial arrangement between the two toxins. The only substitution in the close vicinity of the active site is Asn210ArThr. Thr210A is located at the molecular surface at the edge of the active site cleft and may be involved with RNA base recognition [23]. Although mutation of the asparagine in position 210A was shown to slightly reduce the toxicity of ricin [24], the substitution Asn210ArThr is unlikely to be one of the reasons for ML-I being less toxic than ricin [25]. The A chain of ML-I conjugated to immunotoxins was shown to be even more active than immunotoxins with ricin A chain [26]. The B chain, which binds to cell surface receptors and triggers the endocytotic uptake of the toxin into the cell, is a product of a series of gene duplications [27]. Although the a, b, g subdomains are proposed to be derived from an ancestral galactose binding peptide, only the subunits a1 and g2 retained their ability to bind galactose [28]. While the low-affinity galactose binding site in a1 of MLI is identical with that of the ricin B chain [29], two mutations effect the second binding site in g2, Fig. 3. Due to the replacements Ala239BrGln and Asp255BrLys additional hydrogen bonds to O6 and O2, respectively, of the galactose are possible in ML-I. Before ricin or ML-I can enzymatically inactivate ribosomes, the B chain needs to be separated from the toxic A chain, which is mainly achieved by reduction

of the single disulfide bond between the two chains [30]. Besides this disulfide bond, which is conserved between ricin and ML-I, numerous non-covalent interactions across the interface of A and B chain stabilize the associated subunits, Table 1. Although the main chain fold is almost completely conserved between the ricin and ML-I subunit interfaces, only few of the specific polar and hydrophobic interactions are maintained. In the A chain 34 out of 44 residues, which lie ° within a Van der Waals radius of 3.9 A to B chain atoms, are substituted between ML-I and ricin; in the higher conserved B chain 18 out of 35 interface residues are replaced. Moreover, most of the substitutions in the interface are radical in terms of charge, hydrophobicity or volume. Since the association of the A and B subunits is necessary for toxicity and appears to be mediated by hydrophobic forces [31], changes in the hydrophobic interaction pattern are of interest comparing ML-I and ricin, Table 1. The most striking feature here is the loss of a propeller-shaped arrangement of three interacting aromatic rings of Phe 241A, Phe 141B and Phe 264B near the C-terminus of the ricin B chain, due to the substitutions Phe241ArArg and Phe141BrVal. The differences in the high affinity galactose binding site and especially in the interchain domain support the findings, that B chains of ML-I and ricin react differently with model phospholipid vesicles mimicking a possible interaction with intracellular membranes [25]. The different arrangement of hydrophobic and charged residues in the interchain domain of the B chain is likely to be responsible for the reduced cytotoxic activity of complete ML-I compared to ricin and should be subject of further investigations.
