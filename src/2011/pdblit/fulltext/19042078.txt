Two chimeric proteins, SH and SHA of the "SH3-Bergerac" family (where the -turn N47D48 in spectrin SH3 domain was substituted for KITVNGKTYE or KATANGKTYE sequences, respectively), were analyzed by high-resolution NMR to resolve their spatial structures and to analyze their dynamics. Although the presence of a stable -hairpin in the region of the insertion was confirmed, the introduced extension of the polypeptide chain in SH ( 17%) practically did not affect the total molecule topology. Interestingly, the introduced -hairpin had higher mobility in comparison with other protein regions. Finally, we performed a disorder prediction with the PONDR® VSL2 algorithm and discovered that the inserted -hairpin in both SHH and SHA proteins exhibited significant propensity for intrinsic disorder and therefore for high mobility. In agreement with the experimental data, the predisposition for the increased intramolecular mobility was noticeably higher in SHA. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Protein self-organization is one of the central problems of the modern biology, which continues to be at the focus of intensive research dedicated to understanding the mechanisms of protein folding into the unique 3D structure with specific biological function. Often, a "native" protein structure corresponds to the free energy minimum, which is spontaneously reached by a polypeptide chain. Therefore, the problem of protein folding consists of three major aspects, structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic. The modern research on protein folding is focused on studies on the formation of transition states, secondary structure and folding nucleus, and on the qualitative analysis of the driving forces of this process. It is believed that the most optimal subjects for the analysis of the self-organization mechanisms are "minimal" globular proteins which are able to form

stable 3D structure in the absence of the additional stabilization factors such as disulfide bonds. Among such minimal proteins suitable for the structural and conformational analysis of -structural proteins are isolated Src homology 3 domains (or SH-3) domains and their mutant forms [1­3]. Natural SH3 domains are parts of large multidomain proteins (tyrosine kinases) participating in the signal transduction and other cellular processes that are often associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases [4­8]. Here, SH3 domain plays a role of the structural mediator that recognizes and interacts with the proline-rich sequences that belong either to the extra-domain regions of the own polypeptide chain or to the protein partners [9­12]. In the protein databank, there are more than 30 structures of SH3 domains determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR analysis. Despite the significant amount of the accumulated structural information, the precise mechanisms of the SH3 domain interaction with the prolinerich protein regions and structural and thermodynamic determinants of this binding and the specificity of such interactions are not completely understood as of yet. The folding transition state (the folding nucleus) of SH3 domains is structurally determined and conserved [13]. The most ordered part of this folding nucleus is the so-called distal loop. To better understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of the formation of this structural element, more than 10 chimeric variants of the SH3 domain were created [14]. In these chimeric constructs, the 47­48 -turn was

substituted by a series of decapeptides with the different amino acid sequences. Among such chimeric SH3 variants are SHH and SHA domains which instead of the N47D48 -turn of the wild-type SH3 domain contain KITVNGKTYE and KATANGKTYE sequences, respectively. It was proposed that such insertions will further increase the stability of the -hairpin. As that the extended hairpin was expected to project from the domain in a manner as the nose projects from the face, the family of these chimeric proteins was termed "Bergerac" [14]. Among different members of this family, SHH was shown to possess the highest stability and high solubility [14], which made this chimeric protein an attractive target for the structural analysis by NMR. Intrinsic disorder refers to the lack of a relatively fixed structure in proteins. Many biologically active proteins remain unstructured, or incompletely structured, under physiological conditions [15­45]. Intrinsic disorder has been reported both at a region as well as protein level. There are several crucial differences between amino acid sequences of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions and structured globular proteins and domains. This includes differences in amino acid composition, sequence complexity, hydrophobicity, aromaticity, charge, flexibility index value, and type and rate of amino acid substitutions over evolutionary time. Intrinsically disordered proteins are significantly depleted in so-called order-promoting residues, which include bulky hydrophobic (Ile, Leu, and Val) and aromatic amino acid residues (Trp, Tyr, and Phe), and also possess a low content of Asn and of the cross-linking Cys residues. On the other hand, such proteins are substantially enriched so-called disorderpromoting residues, including polar and charged amino acids: Arg, Gln, Ser, Glu, and Lys and in structure-breaking Gly and Pro residues [15,16,19,46,47]. These differences were utilized to develop various computational tools for disorder prediction, many of which are publicly available [48­50]. These algorithms reached noticeable accuracy in prediction of intrinsically disordered regions and proteins. For ordered proteins with overall low disorder propensity scores, the predicted local increase in the intrinsic disorder tendency often correlates with the increased mobility of a given region [51,52]. Therefore, this correlation between the intrinsic disorder propensities of a given sequence and its dynamic behavior in solution can be used to understand how observed dynamic tendencies are encoded in the primary structures of studied proteins. The accumulated to date thermodynamic and kinetic information on the members of the "Bergerac" family [14,53] requires an adequate structural interpretation. In this work, the structure and dynamics of the chimeric recombinant SHH domain were determined by the heteronuclear NMR and were compared with the structure and dynamics of the SHA domain and the wild-type SH3 domain. These experimental data were then compared to the results of the disorder prediction for SH3, SHH, and SHA proteins by the PONDR® VSL2 algorithm. Such comparison revealed that the inserted -hairpin in both SHH and SHA proteins possesses the local increase in the disorder tendency suggesting their increased intramolecular mobility. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Expression and purification of the SHH and SHA proteins The plasmids pBAT-4 with genes encoding SHH and SHA domains were a kind gift of Luis Serrano and Ana Rosa Viguera. The proteins were expressed and purified as described [54,55]. Purity and integrity of protein samples were checked by SDS­PAGE. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of 17,300 M- 1·cm- 1, determined using the Gill and Hippel method [56]. Uniformly 15N/13C-labeled protein were purified from Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)) grown in M9 minimal medium with [13]glucose (CIL, USA) and [15N]4l (CIL, USA) at concentration 1 g/l.

2.2. NMR spectroscopy NMR protein sample contained 1 mM [15N/13C]SHH in 20 mM Na-acetate buffer, 0.03% NaN3, pH 3.5, in the H2O­22O (9:1) mixture. All NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with the triple-resonance Z-axis gradient probe. To maximally decrease the oligomerization propensity and to preserve the sufficient stability of a protein structure, all the experiments were performed at pH 3.5. Under such conditions, the proteins preserved their native structure but had maximal solubility and low rate of the NH proton exchange with the water. NMR data were processed using XWINNMR/ TOPSPIN (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). The assignment of the 1H, 13C, and 15N signals in spectra were done by a CARA program [57,58]. The semiautomatic protein backbone assignment on the basis of 2D-1H/ 15 N-HSQC and 3D HNCACB spectra was performed using the AutoLink module integrated into the CARA program. At the next stage, HNCACB and CC(CO)NH spectra were used to combine the fragments produced by the semiautomatic assignment and to check the accuracy of this assignment. Furthermore, the CC(CO)NH spectrum was used to assign the 13C-resonances of the side chains of the aliphatic residues, whereas their corresponding proton resonances were determined using the 3D 15N-TOCSY and HCH-TOCSY experiments. The determination of the chemical shifts of the carbons in the carbonyl groups was performed based on the HNCO spectrum. 1H- and 13C-resonances of the side chains of aromatic residues were determined from 1H/13CHSQC and HCH-TOCSY spectra. The indole protons of the W41 and W42 were assigned based on the 2D-1H/15N-HSQC, 3D 15N-TOCSY, and 3D 15N-NOESY spectra. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5sulfonate (DSS) was used as an internal reference standard for all chemical shift measurements, following the IUPAC recommendations [59]. The chemical shifts of other nuclei were recalculated based on the ratio of the gyromagnetic factors [60]. The assigned 1H, 15N, and 13  resonances were deposited to the BioMagResBank database (accession code 11043). The SHH dynamics in the 15N-labelled sample was studied by measuring the parameters of 15N NMR relaxation using the pulse sequences described by Farrow et al. [61] at the field strength of 14.1 T and the temperature of 298 K. The values of the spin­lattice (T1) and spin­spin (T2) relaxation times were calculated from the series of 2D1 H-15N-HSQC spectra with different relaxation delays: 5, 40, 100, 160, 240, 340, 460, 600, 800, and 1200 ms and 8, 48, 64, 80, 100, 128, 160, 208, and 256 ms for T1 and T2,respectively, at the recycling delay of 3 s. Errors for both proteins were estimated to be around ±0.015 s for T1 and ±0.016 s for T2. The transformation of the free induction decay was done in NMRPipe [62] using the Lorenz­Gaussian apodization function in both dimensions. In determination of 1 and 2, the integral values were approximated by the two-parametric exponential function with the accuracy of N96%. The heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) values between 1H and 15N were obtained from the ratio of peak intensities with and without the amide proton saturation for 2.7 s. NOE measurement error was ±0.015. The 15N overall correlation times for SHH backbone were calculated using the 1/2 ratio in the DASHA program. All errors related to the calculation of relaxation parameters are automatically evaluated by the DASHA program [63]. This study represents the largest values of these errors. 2.3. Spatial structure calculation Distance restraints were obtained from the 3D 15N- and 13NOESY experiments (for the aliphatic and aromatic spectral regions) using the mixing time of the magnetization components of 80 ms. NOE peaks were collected using TOPSPIN and then integrated using

CARA [57,58]. The restraints for backbone  and  torsion angles were derived from chemical shifts of backbone atoms using TALOS [64]. The restraints were introduced only for the angles which were supported by the entire set of basic structures TALOS. The most mobile residues (e.g., those located in N- and C-termini) did not satisfy this request. Therefore, the restraints for these residues were not introduced. In the case of the distal loop, the restraints for the residues 51 and 52 participating in -turn were not introduced due to the same reason. Structure calculations were carried out with the program CYANA [65]. The standard CYANA protocol of seven iterative cycles of NOE assignment and structure calculation, followed by a final structure calculation, was applied [65]. An ensemble of 100 structures was calculated and the 20 lowestenergy structures with the fewest violations were selected. The resulting ensemble was in a good agreement with the experimental data and show good statistics according to the analysis of the Ramachandran's plot (see Table 1). Furthermore, the resulting structures satisfied the convergence criteria necessary for the reliable calculations in the program CYANA. The structure was visualized using the program MOLMOL [66]. The evaluation of the temperature coefficients for the amide proton chemical shifts / [ppb]/[K] was used to identify the

candidate for the formation of potential H-bonds as additional important restraints for structure calculation [67]. The values of /  were obtained from 15N-HSQC spectra upon the temperature variation from 298 to 318 K (with a step of 5 K) [67]. Although the Tm  330 K of both studied proteins is close to 318 K, there is a chance of loosing of some of the hydrogen bonds due to the more effective proton exchange at higher temperatures. Therefore, the amide protons which had the absolute values of / close to and less than 5 ppb/K were proposed to be involved in intramolecular Hbonds formation. Furthermore, the almost ideal linearity of plots (r2  0.995) representing the dependence of measured / (accuracy 0.003 ppm) on temperature for all the amino acid residues studied should be noticed. This linearity clearly illustrates the lack of serious dynamic changes within the temperature interval studied. In fact, it is expected that if the high temperatures would induced any noticeable changes in the dynamics of a particular protein region, the linearity of the temperature effects for this region would be violated especially for the data points corresponding to the higher temperatures. The H-bonds acceptors were found by the analysis of 20 preliminary calculated structures. The introduction of these hydrogen bonds was controlled via the repeated calculations of spatial structures to make sure that the final set of structures does not contain any conflicts. By using this approach, 27 pairs of residues for SHH were determined: O50­H53; O53­H50; O48­H55; O55­H48; O57­H46; O59­H44; O42­H61; O 61­H42; O40­H63; O7­H33; O45­ H32; O31­H9; O9­H31; O29­H11; O11­H28; O67­H10; O10­H67; O25­H15; O44­H59; O62­H65; O63­H66; O26­H29; O32­H45; O8­ H69; O65­H13; O44­H59; and O62­H65. Here, O is the oxygen of the carbonyl group, and H is the hydrogen of the amide group, whereas number indicates the number of the corresponding residue. The quality of the resulting 3D structures was further checked by the PROCHECK-NMR program at their deposition to PDB. This control did not reveal any structural violations. The convergence of the solutions corresponds to the crystallographic resolution of 2 Å, which is determined by a good quality of the 3D NOESY spectra and the practically completed assignments of the resonances (96.5%). Both the experimentally determined NMR restraints and the coordinates for SHH chimeric domain were deposited to the PDB database (accession number 2rot). 2.4. Intrinsic disorder calculations The PONDR® VSL2B predictor of intrinsic disorder was used on the sequences of SH3, SHH, and SHA proteins. VSL2B is a variant of VSL2 predictor described in Ref. [68]. For an amino acid sequence, VSL2B outputs prediction for the intrinsic disorder propensity in the [0, 1] range per residue. These outputs then compared to a threshold (we used the default threshold 0.5), and residues with prediction value greater than the threshold were predicted to be intrinsically disordered. The local increase in the intrinsic disorder tendency for an ordered protein with overall low disorder propensity scores is

expected to correlate with the increased mobility of the studied region. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structure of the chimeric SH3 domain The original SH3 domain from spectrin contains 62 amino acid residues [69]. In SHH domain, the natural distal -hairpin was extended by four pairs of the residues and by the introduction of the NG -turn, which was shown to stabilize the hairpin structure (Fig. 1). As a result, the original N47D48 -turn in native spectrin SH3 domain was substituted for KITVNGKTYE sequence in the SHH domain. It is known that although the isolated -hairpins can be formed within the

short peptides with the disjoined ends, such structures did not fold completely at room temperature. In the best-case scenario, the amount of secondary structure formed at room temperature in the isolated -hairpins did not exceed 30­40%. In the case of the isolated hairpin forming the "nose" of the SHH domain, the anticipated amount of formed secondary structure was even less,  20%. Furthermore, the transformation of the unfolded hairpin to its ordered state was described by a very broad transition curve as the folding process of such short peptides was characterized by the relatively low heat effects. However, the anchoring of the ends of the quasi-isolated hairpin without adding steric hindrance, e.g., via the extension of the already existing antiparallel -structure, should produce noticeable stabilization leading to the cooperative melting of the chimeric construct.

Earlier studies revealed that the D48G mutation in the wild-type SH3 domain increased the stability of its native structure by 4 kJ/Mol and resulted in the melting temperature increase from 66 to 74 °C at pH 4.0 [14]. Based on this observation, the NG motif was used as a turn in SHH (Fig. 1). The remaining eight amino acid residues of the inset were chosen according the following criteria: (a) a fragment protruding from the globule should be able to form a -hairpin; (b) this inserted hairpin should be able to stabilize entire protein globule and to form a united cooperative system with the globule; and (c) the insertion should increase and stabilize the folding nucleus, thus making folding process faster. It was also interesting to analyze how the single point mutations affecting the "nose" stability would modulate the structure and the folding kinetics of the entire protein. Therefore, a series of corresponding mutants was designed, including

the SHA double mutant with the I48A and V50A substitutions. The introduction of these two mutations into the SHH domain resulted in the destabilization of the entire chimeric protein by 4 kJ/Mol [14]. Earlier, we determined the 3D structure of the SHA domain and showed that the "nose" region indeed forms the classical antiparallel -hairpin [70]. Therefore, it was interesting to analyze how the differences in the amino acid sequences and conformational stabilities of SHH and SHA domains affect structure and dynamics of these proteins. The assignment of the NMR signals to the corresponding amino acid residue in the SHH primary structure was achieved using the 15Nand 13-labeled protein samples. The combination of the three- and two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments with the application of the magnetic field gradients helped us to make almost

complete assignment of the 15N and 13 nuclei and proteins (see Materials and methods). This assignment was crucial for the subsequent calculation of the SHH spatial structure. Fig. 2 represents the results of one of the assignment steps in a form of the 15N-HSQC spectrum where the cross-peaks corresponding to the amino acid residues in the SHH sequence are marked by their numbers. These NMR data were used to calculate the spatial structure of the SHH domain (see Materials and methods for details). The best 20 models of SHH structure are represented in Fig. 3. According to the Xray crystallographic analysis, SH3 domain was a compact -barrel consisting of five antiparallel -strands [69]. The formation of this structure followed the all-or-none principle (i.e., represented an illustrative example of a "two-state" folding) [71]. Fig. 3 shows that the SHH domain preserved the core structure possessing the characteristic -barrel shape. Interestingly, the noticeable extension of the polypeptide chain in the "Bergerac" ( 17%) in comparison with the original protein practically did not affect the general molecule topology, and all the secondary structure elements were preserved in the SHH-"Bergerac" in comparison with both X-ray [69,72] and NMR structures of the SH3 domain [73­75]. In fact, similar to the original protein, the residues from 8 to 11 in the SHH domain constituted a first -strand. The second -strand in SHH was a bit shorter than in the wild-type protein (I30-L33 in SHH versus I30-N35 in the original SH3). Similar to the wild-type protein, the third -strand in SHH domain started with the residue 41 but due to the "nose" it extended from 5 residues as it was in the wild-type SH3 (residues 41­45) to 10 residues in the SHH"Bergerac" (residues 41­50). Similarly, the fourth -strand was also extended from 6 residues (48­53) in the wild-type protein to 10 in the SHH-"Bergerac" (53­66). All the other secondary structure elements (the 310 helix (63­65) and the fifth -strand (66­68)) in the chimeric SHH completely coincided with those in the wild-type SH3. The original NMR data and statistics are given in Table 1. Fig. 4A represents the results of the RMSD calculations for each amino acid residue in the sets of 20 structures with the minimal energy for SHH (white bars) and SHA (dark bars). It can be seen that the RMSD values for the majority of the residues in both proteins (except for several regions discussed above) were 0.8 Å or lower. This meant that the SHH and SHA polypeptide chains were well folded into the relatively rigid structures. The high RMSD values for seven N-terminal and two C-terminal residues in both proteins reflected higher ambiguity, most likely due to the high mobility of these regions. Residues from the 48­ 55 fragment comprising the extended -hairpin (nose) also had RMSD values of 1 Å. This indicated the relatively high mobility of this region in both proteins. Although the results of structure calculation for both proteins were relatively close (see Table 1), the noticeable differences in their RMSD values were likely related to the difference in the intramolecular mobility. The analysis of the intramolecular dynamics of both proteins confirmed this hypothesis. 3.2. Dynamics of the SHH- and SHA-"Bergeracs" An averaged time of the rotational correlation of the protein as a whole determined from the T1/T2 ratio [76] was m = 4.0 ± 0.2 ns. This measured value corresponded well to the value expected for a monomeric protein with the molecular mass of 8 kDa (as determined at 298 K) [77]. 15 N-NMR is widely used for the analysis of the rotational diffusion of a protein molecule and for the evaluation of the local dynamic of a polypeptide chain. To characterize the backbone dynamics in the SHH- and SHA-"Bergeracs", Fig. 4B­D represent the corresponding NOE, T1, and T2 data. These results correlated with the RMSD data (Fig. 4A) and were consistent with the conclusion that there were three regions with increased mobility in these proteins, which were their N- and C-terminal fragments and the 48­50 region. According

to these data, the 48­50 region was more mobile in the SHA"Bergerac" (filled symbols) than in the SHH domain (open symbols). This was especially obvious from the data shown in Fig. 4B. The analysis of the relaxation data T1, T2 and NOE within the frames of the model-free approach [78,79] provided a possibility to determine the order parameter S2. This analysis was performed using the DASHA program [63], and the results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 5A. In this plot, circles represent the per-residue distribution of the order parameter S2 measured for SHA, whereas squares show the S2 data for the SHH domain. The straight lines in the plot represent the mean S2 values at the regions (8­45 and 57­68) where the small deviations in the S2 behavior can be neglected, whereas the smooth lines in the 45­57 region represent the approximations of the experimental data by the 6th order polynomials. The choice of the corresponding spectral density function for various residues was based on the minimal values of the penalty function [61]. The values of the various parameters of internal mobility (the order parameter S2 and correlation time ) for each SHA and SHH residues evaluated by the model-independent approach are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (see Supplementary materials). The internal mobility of the majority of the amino acid residues in the SHH-"Bergerac" (8­18, 22­46, 57, 59­69) was described by the order parameter S2 values close to unity, suggesting their relatively rigid fixation in the domain structure. However, N- and C-terminal fragments together with the "nose" (residues 5­7, 47­52, 55­58, 70) were relatively flexible, which was reflected in the relatively low S2 values. Furthermore, the behavior of several residues was better

described by the spectral density function with higher number of parameters. For example, the internal mobility of residues 5, 19, 21, 47­52, 55, 56, and 58 was more adequately described by parameters S2 and  (correlated internal motions) [78], where S2 and  were the order parameter and the correlation time of internal mobility, respectively. This was due to the fact that for some N-terminus, Cterminus, and "nose" residues, the decrease in the order parameter S2 to and below 0.9 resulted in the appearance of the fast motions ( = 0.1 / 1 ns), which, in fact, were faster than the rotational correlation of the protein as a whole. The mobility of four residues 7, 49, 55, and 70 in SHA and four residues 7, 53, 54, and 70 in SH was accurately described by four parameters, S2, f , S2, and s, representing the case of the uncorrelated f s internal motions [79]. Here, S2 and s were the order parameter and s the correlation time of the slow internal motion, whereas S2 and f f were the order parameter and the correlation time of the fast internal motion. For some residues (e.g., residues 53 and 54 of SHH), the need to consider two groups of independent parameters suggests that the relatively slow motions of the polypeptide chain (s 0.12 ns) are superimposed with independent fast motions (f 0.04 ns) of either side chains or alternating H-bonds within this -strand. Although the amplitudes of these motions are comparable (S2  0.88 and S2  0.88), s f the value of the order parameter of the uncorrelated motions, being determined by their multiplication, is relatively low. Overall, our data suggested that the most mobile parts of the SHH and SHA domains were their first 7 amino acid residues and residues corresponding to the "nose" (see Fig. 5A). Despite the well-folded structure of the "nose", which is evident from the spatial models (Fig. 6) and from the deviations of chemical shits in this region from the random coil values [14], the distal loop, being surrounded by the solvent, experiences a specific "vibration" whose characteristic times are noticeably lower than the overall correlation time. Likely, due to this fact, the mentioned vibration does not affect the overall protein structure and is not reflected in the chemical shits. Interestingly, the relatively long RT-loop (residues 14­27) which was not involved into the secondary structure formation of these

proteins was essentially less mobile than the "nose". Despite the high content of the potential candidates to form hydrogen bonds in RTloop (7 of 14 amide protons, see Fig. 3), the only one H-bond, which did not increase the number of constraints violated in the best 20 structures, was actually found, O25-H15, a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of residue 25 and the amide group of residue 15. The increased mobility of the "nose" can be attributed to the fact that the protruding -hairpin was relatively isolated from the remaining protein structure and therefore was not supported by the 3D network of the local contacts. These factors decreased the local rigidity of the hairpin, although the mean atom positions in this protrusion corresponded to the "ideal" -structure. Another factor affecting the dynamic characteristics of this region could be the mobility of the long "nose" as a whole. For example, the substitution of I48 and V50 in the SHH domain by two Ala residues in the SHA-"Bergerac" made the "nose" 12% lighter, which might affect its overall mobility. 3.3. Mechanisms defining the intramolecular dynamics of the "Bergerac" proteins To understand whether the outlined dynamic preferences were somehow encoded in the SHH and SHA primary structures, the distribution of intrinsic disorder propensities within the sequences of these proteins was evaluated using a PONDR® VSL2 algorithm, which is one of the most accurate predictors of intrinsic disorder developed so far [68]. Fig. 5B shows that the "nose" (residues 47­55) together with the adjacent residues 56­60 and the RT-loop (residues 14­27) were located in regions with the increased flexibility as predicted by PONDR® VSL2 algorithm. It was not a surprise to find that the RT-loop was predicted to be flexible, as similar to the majority of loops in proteins this region is composed mostly of the disorder-promoting residues. However, the mobility of this loop was restricted in the structures of the SH3-"Bergeracs". Table 2 showed that in both the SHH and SHA proteins, the RT-loop was heavily involved in multiple contacts with the remaining protein structure. This suggested that the intrinsic predisposition of the RT-loop for high local flexibility was

potentially overridden by the long-distance (in sequence) contacts with the protein body. Analysis of Table 2 showed that the RT-loop in SH protein had even less amount of contacts than the loop in SH"Bergerac". Surprisingly, Fig. 5B showed that the intrinsic propensity for flexibility was slightly higher in the SHA RT-loop than in the SHH loop. The fact that the "nose" was predicted to be flexible in both SHHand SHA-"Bergeracs" was interesting, as sequences for these insertions were chosen to be able to form a -hairpin, to stabilize the protein globule, and to form a united cooperative system with the globule. Likely this was due to the selection of the amino acid residues suitable to support quasi-isolated structure of the protrusion. Interestingly, the "nose" of the SHH-"Bergerac" was predicted to be noticeably less flexible than the "nose" from the chimeric SHA domain. This finding was in a good agreement with the reported above experimental data. Another important finding was that the region of the predicted increased flexibility in the vicinity of residue 50 was completely missing in the wild-type SH3 domain (see Fig. 5C). This clearly showed that the described behavior was mostly determined by the insertion of the -hairpin sequence. SHH and SHA domains were chosen from the 10 chimeric "Bergerac" variants with different primary structure of the "nose" [14]. Analysis of literature data revealed that the stability of the isolated antiparallel -hairpin was determined by several key factors, including the -turn structure, the presence of the threonine pair at the opposing sites, the presence of massive hydrophobic and aromatic residues at the definite positions, etc. Several "Bergerac" variants were designed to study the effect of the alanine substitutions at these key positions in the optimized SHH domain on the "nose" stability and on the stability of the domain as whole. For example, SHA variant was obtained by substituting the cluster of two large hydrophobic groups (I48 and V50) by alanines. Such double mutation noticeably decreased the conformational stability of the chimeric domain in urea-induced [14] and heat-induced unfolding experiments [80]. In both cases, U G0 (the Gibbs free energy associated with the unfolding N w of the structure in water at standard temperature of 298 K) was 5 kJ/ mol, which comprised more than 20% of the total stabilization energy of the SHH structure at neutral pH. Since, as mentioned above, either temperature or urea-induced unfolding transitions in both chimeras are highly cooperative [80] and the replaced residues do not interact directly with the domain body, this difference in the overall stability of the chimeras should be attributed to the change in the intrinsic

Gibbs energy of the inserted -hairpin extension caused by the double mutation. Except for the differences in the internal hairpin stability, two other effects could cause the observed changes in the hairpin dynamics. The analysis of X-ray [80] and NMR structures of SHH domain (this work) revealed that the side chains of I48, V50, and Y55 constitute a tightly packed hydrophobic cluster (IVY) (Fig. 6). In the crystal structure, this cluster is included into the hydrophobic core comprised by the four "noses" [80]. However, according to our data, such a packing likely represented the crystallization artifact, as the formation of such a tetramer was not detected in the solution even when protein concentration was as high as 1 mM. Another important difference between SHH and SHA concerns the "frustration" effect manifested in a remarkable curvature of the refolding wing on of the "shevron" plot of the former chimera [14]. As discussed in this and later studies [53, 80], this frustration is most likely caused by introducing massive hydrophobic groups with a high but not very specific -sheet propensity into SHH sequence, which results not only in stabilizing of the native fold but also of some off-pathway intermediate state(s). This effect, which in its nature could be similar to the "nose" oligomerization discussed above, is, however, hardly related to the stability and dynamics of the completely folded and eventually identical "native" states considered in this study. Based on these observations, we might conclude that the increased stability of the SHH domain in comparison with the SHA variant was mostly determined by the additional intramolecular interactions, which might affect local dynamic characteristics. In fact, the analysis of the order parameter S2 (see Fig. 5A) indicated that the IVY motion amplitudes in SHH were more or less uniform, whereas AAY motion amplitudes in SHA appeared uncorrelated. Although these data can be interpreted as an indication of the decreased mobility of the residues forming the IVY cluster in SHH in comparison with the AAY cluster in SHA, one should remember that that the approach used to evaluate the order parameter is in fact model bound. However, the hypothesis on the decreased mobility of the residues forming the IVY cluster in SHH was further confirmed by the significantly lower RMSD values for SHH. Furthermore, Fig. 5B clearly showed that the SHH "nose" was characterized by the decreased propensity for the intrinsic flexibility. Therefore, we suggested that the major factor determining both the cluster formation almost at the tip of the "nose" and the stability increase in the SHH-"Bergerac" was the hydrophobic effect. However, the contribution of the van der Waals contacts determining by the tight packing of the massive side chains cannot be excluded. Furthermore, for the amide proton at the 55 position of the SHH"Bergerac", the value of the temperature coefficient /, which reflected the possibility to form H-bond, was significantly lower than the threshold value (5 ppb/), above which the formation of the hydrogen bond is believed to be problematic [67]. This additional hydrogen bond in the "nose" was taken into account during the modeling of the SHH-"Bergerac" 3D structure. This could further decrease mobility of this region in SHH. The analysis of the SHH and SHA structures showed that the "nose" region in the close proximity of the 48 and 50 positions was much better protected by the side chains of I48 and V50 in SHH than by side chains of alanines in SHA. This determined the noticeable difference in the Y55 orientation in SHH and SHA structures (see Fig. 6). The mentioned changes in the Y55 orientation were also supported by the data for the chemical shift of the -protons in the tyrosine side chain. In fact, this shift in the 1H-13C-HSQC spectrum of SHH was changed by 0.12 ppm in comparison with that of SHA. This value significantly exceeded changes observed for other chemical shifts, whose maximal change was 0.01 ppm. More detailed analysis of the chemical shifts for the protons of the alanine methyl groups in SHA revealed their positive shift in comparison with the position of the proton signals in short peptides and free amino acid residues. This shift was maximal for A48 (0.34 ppm). Such shift characterized the position of the

neighboring groups as located above the aromatic ring plane [81]. In SHH, the methyl groups of I48 experienced the maximal influence (-0.27 ppm), but its shift was in the opposite direction. This shift characterized the position of the neighboring groups as located in the plane of the aromatic ring [81]. Therefore, according to the chemical shift analysis, the Y55 orientation was changed by almost 90o relative to its neighbors. Acknowledgements We are thankful to Drs.
