Abstract Described are the syntheses plus the spectroscopic and structural characterizations of the chromium(III) complexes trans-[Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4) (1) (cyclam=1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) and [Cr(tetA)(ONO)2](NO3)·H2O (2) (tetA = 5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). The optical absorption spectra of these are dominated by a spin allowed ligand field band at 476 and 480, respectively, and by a nitrite ligand localized n p* band at 336 and 344 nm, respectively. The crystalline phases of both materials consist of Cr(III) complex ions situated at unit cell edge and face centers that correspond to the crystallographic inversion centers. For 1 the charge balancing BF4- anions are orientationally disordered and are positioned in the cavities formed by the complexes. For 2, the nitrate anion and water molecule forms pairs through the O H···O type hydrogen bond and each pair has two statistical orientations. © 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Recent studies in this laboratory have been concerned with photochemical strategies for delivering the bioregulatory molecule nitric oxide to biological targets [2]. One approach has involved probing the photolability of metal nitrosyl complexes such as the Roussin's red salt anion [Fe2S2(NO)4]2 - and nitrosyl porphyrins such as Ru(OEP)(NO)(Cl) (OEP= octaethylporphyrin) toward NO labilization [3,4]. Another strategy would be to exploit the photoreactivity of metal nitrito complexes M ONO toward photolytic cleavage of the coordinated NO (Eq. (1)).

proved in that case to be less important than competing NO2 formation (Eq. (2)) [5]. The chromium analog Cr(TPP)(ONO) was shown by Hoshino et al. [6] to be much more photolabile toward Eq. (1), a result that Ln M ONO  Ln M+ NO2

might be rationalized in terms of the greater oxophilicity of the Cr(III) center. These results led this laboratory to survey the photochemistry of several water soluble Cr(III) nitrito complexes including the pentaammine species Cr(NH3)5(ONO)2 + . The latter clearly showed some NO release when photolyzed with near UV light, but also demonstrated considerable labilization of ammine ligands [1] as expected from the long known ligand field photochemistry of tetraammine and pentaammine complexes of chromium(III) [7]. However, it is also known that chelation of a cyclam ligand (cyclam= 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) in transdiacido complexes of the type trans-Cr(cyclam)X2+ suppresses the photosubstitution pathways. For example, the photosubstitution quantum yield for ligand

field excitation of trans-Cr(cyclam)Cl2+ is a least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that seen for complexes such as Cr(NH3)5Cl2 + and trans-Cr(NH3)4Cl2+ [8]. This pattern led us to prepare complexes of the type trans-Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2+ which proved to be very photoactive toward NO formation (Eq. (1)) but relatively unreactive toward labilization of the coordinated nitrites as either nitrite ion or NO2. These photochemical studies are reported elsewhere [9]. Described here are the syntheses and spectral characterizations as well as the X-ray crystal structures of thermally stable salts of two new complexes of this type, trans-[Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4) (1) and trans-[Cr(tetA)(ONO)2](NO3) (2) (tetA =5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11tetraazacyclotetradecane).

2. Experimental

2.1. Procedures and instrumentation
All syntheses were carried out in the presence of air using deionized water as the solvent. Cyclam (1,4,8,11tetraazacyclotetradecane) was purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. TetA was synthesized from the preparation reported by Hay and Lawrance [10]. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen elemental analysis were performed by Galbraith Laboratories. Chromium analysis were performed by ICP. Electronic spectra were recorded using a Hewlett Packard model HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Infrared spectra were recorded using a BioRad model FTS 60 SPC 3200 FTIR spectrophotometer. High and low resolution mass spectra were obtained using a VG-70 SE double focusing magnetic sector mass spectrometer system with OPUS/SIOS data system and interface (Fast Atom Bombardment) or a VG Fisons Platform II single quadrapole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source run with a Fisons Masslinks data system.

pension using a 0.2 micron filter. The resulting orange solution was concentrated by rotary evaporation. As the volume of solution decreased, a slightly white insoluble precipitate (probably unreacted AgNO2) began to form. Once the excess water was removed, the resulting orange paste was dissolved in no more than 3 ml of water (sonnication was used to ensure full dissolution), and the solution was filtered using a plastic syringe and a 0.2 microfilter. The deeply colored orange solution was treated with a 3 ml volume of saturated NaBF4 solution (dissolved in water) and allowed to sit. After several minutes, the complex was salted out by adding several scoops of solid NaNO2. The solution was sonnicated to ensure all of the sodium nitrite had dissolved. As each scoop of sodium nitrite was dissolved, the light orange powder quickly began to fall out of solution and continued to do so as more solid NaNO2 was added. Once precipitation was complete, the flask was allowed to cool overnight in the refrigerator. The next day, the solid was separated with filtration using a medium frit and washed with acetone and ether. Crude yield: 0.222 g (61%). The complex was recrystallized by diffusion of ether into a methanol solution of the compound. Orange square crystals resulted. Recrystallization yield: 56%. Overall yield: 31%.

2.3. Synthesis of trans-[Cr(tetA)(ONO)2](NO3) ·H2O
The trans-[Cr(tetA)(ONO)2](NO3)·H2O was prepared from the analogous nitrate complex trans[Cr(tetA)(ONO2)2](NO3) (3) as follows. A 0.210 g portion of 3, prepared according to the literature procedure [11], was added to water, and the solution was heated to reflux. After several minutes, all of the nitrato derivative dissolved in the refluxing water. The red solution was then removed from the heat and allowed to cool until it was luke warm. Once cooled, the reddish solution was treated with a saturated sodium nitrite solution until it turned light orange­ yellow. As the sodium nitrite was added, the orange solution quickly gave an orange precipitate and a lightly colored orange solution. (In trials where the sodium nitrite was added to the hot solution, a greenish decomposition product formed.) Once the precipitate stopped forming, the precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with ether. Any excess water was removed by desiccating the solution overnight over KOH pellets. The crude product was recrystallized in

2.2. Synthesis of trans-[Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4)
trans-[Cr(Cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4) was prepared according to the following procedure. A 0.3 g portion of trans-[Cr(cyclam)(Cl)2](Cl) [5] (0.0008 mol) was dissolved in a minimum amount of water and the resulting purple solution was heated to reflux temperature. To the refluxing solution, a 0.388 g sample (0.0025 mol) of AgNO2 dissolved in hot water was added immediately giving a milky white suspension owing to the ionic halide present. Refluxing was continued for 45 min during which time the color changed from purple to a deep orange color and more AgCl formed. The flask was then allowed to cool to room temperature and the AgCl was removed by filtration from the orange sus-

3. Results and discussion The syntheses of the compounds trans-[Cr(III)(cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4) (1) and trans-[Cr(III)(tetA)(ONO)2](NO3)·H2O (2) by the ligand metathesis procedures outlined above proved successful as indicated by the crystal structures described below. The compositions of these compounds were confirmed by high resolution FAB mass spectrometry (cationic) which gave the respective parent ion m/z values 344.126413 (calc. for M+ (CrC10H24N6O4BF4): 344.127426 m/z) and 428.220314 (calc. for M+ (CrC16H38N7O8): 428.221053 m/z).

2.4. Single crystal structure analysis of 1 and 2
Crystals of 1 were grown in the refrigerator by diffusion of ether into a solution of trans-[Cr(III)(cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4) in methanol overnight. Crystals of 2 were grown by recrystallization from 2:1 water­ acetone in a refrigerator. A crystal of each complex was glued to a thin glass fiber with epoxy resin and mounted on a SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with a normal focus, 2.4 kW sealed tube X-ray source , (Mo Ka radiation, u =0.71073 A) operating at 50 kV and 40 mA. The temperature control was achieved with an Oxford Cryostream which provided a temperature range from 80 to 375 K with a stability of about 0.1 K. About 1.3 hemisphere of intensity data were collected in 1321 frames with  scans (width of 0.30° and exposure time of 30 s per frame) at 150 K. The empirical absorption corrections were based on the equivalent reflections and other possible effects such as absorption by the glass fiber were simultaneously corrected. All structures were solved by direct methods followed by successive difference Fourier methods. Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were calculated at ideal positions and refined as riding atoms of the parent atoms. Hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen or oxygen atoms were located from difference Fourier maps and refined isotropically. The calculations were performed using

3.1. Electronic spectra
trans-[Cr(III)(Cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4) (1) is an orange colored solid. In aqueous solution its optical spectrum is characterized by two broad absorption bands (Fig. 1). The higher energy transition displays a umax at 336 nm with an extinction coefficient of 267 M - 1 cm - 1 in water. A similar absorption band for the analogous bis(ethylenediamine) complex trans-[Cr(III)(en)2(ONO)2](ClO4) (4) was assigned by Fee and Harrowfield as an intraligand n p* transition localized on the nitrite ligand [12]. This transition is characteristic of the O-bound nitrito complexes of Cr(III) [12­14]. The analogous isomeric N-coordinated nitro complexes of Cr(III) are not known. However, comparison of nitro/ nitrito isomers of the cobalt(III) amine complexes, e.g. Co(NH3)5(ONO)2 + versus Co(NH3)5(NO2)2 + indicates the presence of a similar n­p* band at 361 nm (275 M - 1 cm - 1) for the former which is replaced by a more intense ligand to metal charge transfer band at 325 nm (1660) in the latter [14]. The lower energy band at umax = 476 nm (m= 40 M - 1 cm - 1) can be assigned to the L1 d­d ligand field transition commonly found in Cr(III) species. In the holehedral D4h symmetry of 1, this would be the lowest energy spin allowed transition, 4 A2g  4B2g, 4Eg. Again, a similar band has been observed in the spectrum of 4 [12]. Another ligand field transition, L2, would be expected to appear at higher energy but this is apparently obscured by the more intense nitrito intraligand transfer. Table 1 gives a comparison of the spectrum of 1 with those of 2 and other known chromium(III) nitrito complexes [12­14]. Solid 2 is deep orange colored. In DMF solution the electronic spectrum is characterized by several detectable absorption bands (Fig. 2). The higher energy absorption band displays considerable structure with

maxima at 344 nm (m= 213 M - 1 cm - 1), 360 nm (188), 372 nm (169), 386 nm (138), and 402 nm (87) in DMF solution. The broad band can be assigned to a nitrite localized intraligand n­p* and the fine structure of this band has also been seen in the absorption spectrum of trans-[Cr(III)(en)2(ONO)2](ClO4) as well as of alkylnitrites in dipolar aprotic solvents but not in aqueous solution. This has been interpreted in terms of specific solvent interactions between the nitrogen's lone pair and the solvent [12]. Another band occurs at 480 nm (39 M - 1 cm - 1) and in analogy to the 1 and other complexes this can be assigned to the L1 ligand field band (Table 1).

3.4. Structure of trans-[Cr(III)(cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4)
Both Cr complexes and BF4- anions are located at the crystallographic symmetry sites (Fig. 3). This leads to only half of the molecular unit per asymmetric unit. The Cr ion is located within the plane defined by the four coordinating nitrogen atoms. Although the data were collected at 150 K to minimize thermal motions, the structure of trans-[Cr(III)(cyclam)(ONO)2](BF4)

3.2. IR spectra
The infrared spectrum of 1 shows three bands characteristic of an O-bound nitrito ligand [15,16] at 1493 cm - 1 (was, strong), 987 cm - 1 (ws, strong) and 827 cm - 1 (lwag, strong). This spectrum also shows two relatively weak peaks at 877 and 875 cm - 1 reported by Poon and Pun to be characteristic of the N H wagging modes of a trans configured cyclam ring [17]. In contrast, the spectrum of the corresponding cis isomer of 1 should display a quartet of bands in this region. The IR spectrum of 2 exhibits the three expected nitrito ligand bands at 1492 cm - 1 (was), 966 cm - 1 (ws) and 825 cm - 1 (lwag).

3.3. Mass spectra
Aqueous solutions of 1 were examined by low-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (positive ion) to reveal the parent peak resolved as [Cr(III)(cyclam)(ONO)2]+ at 344 m/z. Other peaks were seen at 314 m/z ([Cr(III)(cyclam)(ONO)2]+ ( NO)), 284 ([Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2]+ ( 2NO)), and 267 m/z ([Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2]+ ( NO, ONO, H)). FAB+ MS of 2 revealed an M+ parent peak at 428 m/z corresponding to the cationic species t[Cr(III)(tetA)(ONO)2]+. Other peaks were seen at 398 m/z ([Cr(III)(tetA)(ONO)2]+ ( NO)) and 351 m/z ([Cr(III)(tetA)(ONO)2]+ ( NO, ONO, H+)).

had a relatively high Rf (6.02%). This can be attributed the orientational disorder of the BF4- counter anion, which persists even at very low temperature. Such an orientational disorder of BF4- anions is also evident when the refinements were performed in lower symmetry space group such as Cc, supporting the selection of the centric space group (C2/c) in the final structural refinement. Half of the Cr complexes are located at unit cell edges (a and b axes) and have the same orientation while the other half are located at unit cell face centers (ac and bc planes) and are oriented slightly differently (5.5° between mean molecular planes of two types of molecules). This gives rise to four molecules per unit cell, as expected from the crystallographic refinement. The structure can be viewed as side-by-side stacking of the Cr complexes along the crystallographic b axis and BF4- anions are located within the cavities formed by the Cr complexes. The crystallographic results are summarized in Table 2, and selected bond distances and angles are given in Table 3. The structure of the trans-[Cr(III)(cyclam)(ONO)2]+ cation is characterized by typical bond distances when compared with other dinitrito crystal structure data. , The Cr(1) O(1) bond length is 1.987(3) A and the , O(1) N(3) bond length is 1.318(5) A, both close to the respective Cr O and CrO NO bond lengths seen in analogous monodentate nitrito complexes of Cr(III) , [18]. The O(2) N(3) bond length at 1.217(5) A is shorter than the latter and is consistent with a localized double bond at this site as illustrated by A. The bond

angles were determined to be 118.6(3) and 114.8(4)° for the CrON and ONO angles, respectively.

3.5. Structure of trans-[Cr(III)(tetA)(ONO)2] (NO3) ·H2O
The crystallographic results are summarized in Table 2, and selected bond distances and angles are given in Table 3. The [Cr(III)(tetA)(ONO)2]+ cation has an inversion center and the CrN4 unit is planar (Fig. 4) as indicated by the 180° N Cr N bond angles. The nitrito ligands were resolved as having normal bond lengths and bond angles for oxygen bound nitrito ligands (Table 3). The Cr(1) O(1) bond lengths are 1.9729(12) , , A; the O(1) N(3) bond lengths are 1.311(2) A and the N(3) O(2) (CrON O) bond lengths are shorter at , 1.205(2) A consistent with those Cr(III) nitrito structures previously reported [16,18]. The nitrito ligand has a normal bond angle of 114.2(2)°. The charge balancing nitrate anions and water molecules are located near an inversion center and the distance from the nitrogen atom to the inversion center , is 1.267 A. Thus the nitrate anion can be located on either side of the inversion center with one water molecule positioned on the other side. In other words, the structure consists of pairs of NO3- and H2O and in

the crystal lattice each pair can have two different statistical orientations (Fig. 4(b)). This result was backed up by the elemental analysis which agreed with assignment of the structure as trans-[Cr(III)(tetA)(ONO)2] (NO3)·H2O. The formation of such pairs is likely due to the strong O H···O type hydrogen bond between water molecules and nitrate anions, as sug, gested by the short distance (2.748 A) between O(4) and O(3)%. One difference between the BF4- phase and the NO3- phase is that the anions in the BF4- phase are located on the twofold axis whereas the anions in the NO3- phase are situated around the inversion center.

Similar to 1, half of the Cr complex cations in 2 are located at unit cell edges (the b axis) and have the same orientation while the other half are located at unit cell face centers (the ac plane) and are oriented differently (28.8° between mean molecular planes of two types of molecules). This gives rise to two molecules per unit cell, consistent with the refinement result. In summary, the two trans dinitrito complexes 1 and 2 described here display electronic and IR spectral properties as well as structures typical of those expected for the nitrito complexes of chromium(III). Although they have been demonstrated to undergo facile photochemical cleavage of the CrO NO bond to release NO there is no indication in the ground state structures that these complexes are any more predisposed to do so than are other Cr(III) nitrito complexes. Thus the photochemical behavior of these complexes must be attributed to constraints on excited state structural changes imposed by the tetraazo macrocyclic ligands.
