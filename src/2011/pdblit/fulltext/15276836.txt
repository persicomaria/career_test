3-Deoxy-D -arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthases are metal-dependent enzymes that catalyse the first committed step in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in microorganisms and plants, the condensation of 2-phophoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D -erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) to DAHP. The DAHP synthases are possible targets for fungicides and represent a model system for feedback regulation in metabolic pathways. To gain further insight into the role of the metal ion and the catalytic mechanism in general, the crystal structures of several complexes between the tyrosine-regulated form of DAHP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and different metal ions and ligands have been determined. The crystal structures provide evidence that the simultaneous presence of a metal ion and PEP result in an ordering of the protein into a conformation that is prepared for binding the second substrate E4P. ° The site and binding mode of E4P was derived from the 1.5 A resolution crystal structure of DAHP synthase in complex with PEP, Co2þ, and the E4P analogue glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Our data suggest that the oxygen atom of the reactive carbonyl group of E4P replaces a water molecule coordinated to the metal ion, strongly favouring a reaction mechanism where the initial step is a nucleophilic attack of the double bond of PEP on the metal-activated carbonyl group of E4P. Mutagenesis experiments substituting specific amino acids coordinating PEP, the divalent metal ion or the second substrate E4P, result in stable but inactive Aro4p-derivatives and show the importance of these residues for the catalytic mechanism.

Introduction
3-Deoxy-D -arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase catalyses the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids in bacteria, fungi, and plants; the stereospecific condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D -erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), forming DAHP and inorganic phosphate. For this reaction, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli utilise two and three isoenzymes, respectively, that are under negative feedback regulation by different end products of the pathway. Yeast Aro3p and E. coli AroG are inhibited by phenylalanine, the yeast Aro4p and E. coli AroF by tyrosine.1,2 The crystal

Active Site of DAHP Synthase from S. cerevisiae

structures of the phenylalanine-regulated isoform of DAHPS from E. coli3 and of the tyrosine-regulated isoform from S. cerevisiae4 have been determined recently. Both proteins fold as (b/a)8-barrels enhanced by extensions at the N terminus and between a-helix a5 and b-sheet b6. Their struc° tures are highly similar (r.m.s.d. 0.60 A for 329 a 4 equivalent C atoms ) despite the fact that they originate from different organisms and implement different regulatory mechanisms. In both, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, the reaction requires the presence of a divalent metal ion. Reactivation experiments in which different metal ions were added after removal of the original cations have shown a pronounced dependence of the catalytic efficiency on the type of metal ion.5,6 Using the activity obtained with Zn2þ, Cu2þ, and Fe2þ as the reference, the following activity series has been measured for the tyrosine-regulated DAHPS from S. cerevisiae: Co2þ (167%) q Zn2þ, Cu2þ, Fe2þ (100%) . Cd2þ, Ni2þ (70%) q Mn2þ, Mg2þ (20%).7 The crystal structure of the phenylalanine-regulated DAHPSEC in complex with Pb2þ and PEP (DAHPSEC·Pb2þ·PEP),3 allowed the location of the binding sites of the metal and the first substrate, PEP, on the C-terminal face of the ba-barrel. The crystal structure of DAHPSSC in complex with PEP4 confirmed this binding site. Knowledge about the binding site and binding mode of the second substrate, E4P, is limited and is based on a model using a bound sulphate ion as a tethering point for the phosphate moiety of E4P.8 Recently, the binding site of the effector molecule phenylalanine in DAHPSEC was located on the N-terminal face of the ba-barrel in a crystal structure containing the DAHPSEC·Mn2þ·PEP·Phe complex and a model for the allosteric inhibition has been proposed.9 For the tyrosine-regulated DAHPSSC, amino acid substitutions strongly support a similar location for the binding of tyrosine.4 Biochemical studies have shown that the reaction catalysed by DAHPS is stereospecific with respect to the C3 atom of PEP involving a si-attack at this centre.10 Labelling experiments demonstrate that the release of inorganic phosphate from PEP occurs by the cleavage of the C ­O rather than the O ­ P bond.11 As a consequence, the anomeric oxygen atom of DAHPS originates from bulk solvent. The detailed course of the reaction is, however, still a matter of debate. The two principal routes currently being discussed differ in the primary step and are depicted in Figure 1. Path A starts with a nucleophilic attack of C3PEP on the metalactivated carbonyl group of C1E4P, resulting in a linear oxocarbenium ion.6 In contrast, the initial step of path B is the attack of a hydroxide (obtained from metal-assisted dissociation of a water molecule) on the vinylic double bond, leading to a tetrahedral C3PEP-carbanion intermediate that subsequently attacks the carbonyl group of E4P.12 A group of enzymes that is closely related to DAHP synthase, both in terms of three-dimen-

sional structure and in terms of the reaction catalysed are the 3-deoxy-D -manno-octulosonate-8phosphate synthases (KDOPS). These enzymes play an essential role in the biosynthesis of lypopolysaccharides in most Gram-negative bacteria and catalyse the condensation of PEP and A5P to form KDOP and inorganic phosphate. In contrast to DAHP synthases, KDOP synthases can function with and without metal ions. Representative crystal structures for the metal-independent form from E. coli13,14 and the metal-dependent form from Aquifex aeolicus15 ­ 17 have been determined. Sequences and three-dimensional folds indicate an evolutionary relationship between KDOP synthases and DAHP synthases.18 ­ 21 Interestingly, KDOP synthases are lacking the structural elements that extend the (b/a)8-barrel, reflecting the fact that these enzymes are not feedback-regulated. The reaction mechanism of KDOP synthases is still under discussion. For the metal-dependent KDOPS from A. aeolicus, Gatti et al. favour a mechanism, first suggested by Hedstroem & Abeles,12 in which initially a water molecule is activated by the metal ion to form a hydroxide ion, which then attacks the C2 atom of PEP from the si-side (corresponding to path B in Figure 1). The next step of the reaction is the condensation between C3PEP and C1A5P.15 ­ 17 As in the metal-independent KDOPS from E. coli this reaction has to start without a hydroxide originating from the metalassisted activation of a water, Asojo et al.13 have suggested a mechanism for this class of enzymes where initially the nucleophilicity of C3PEP is increased by interactions of PEP with the enzyme in order to support a direct nucleophilic attack by C3PEP onto the electrophilic C1 atom of A5P (in a way analogous to path A in Figure 1). In the following, we describe a series of highresolution crystal structures of complexes between DAHPS and metal ions, substrates, and substrate analogues that provide further insight into the catalytic mechanism. The crystal structure of the complex between DAHPSSC, PEP, Co2þ, and the E4P ° analogue G3P at 1.5 A represents the highest-resolution structure so far for this class of enzymes and establishes the binding mode of E4P. Several single-point mutations are introduced into the ARO4 gene encoding the tyrosine-regulated DAHPSSC in support of the proposed catalytic mechanism.

Results
Overall structure Here, a total of four different crystal forms containing between two and eight monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit have been investigated (Table 1). Despite the different packing arrangements in the crystal, the quaternary structure of DAHP synthase is a homotetramer with approximate 222 symmetry in all cases (Figure 2).

Figure 1. Simplified description of two possible pathways for the biosynthesis of DAHP.

In the monoclinic C2 crystal form, the homotetramer is generated by application of the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry operator to a dimer. As described for both DAHPSEC and DAHPSSC, the tetramer is formed by two tight dimers of the enzyme. Within the dimers, the N terminus of one monomer entwines the second monomer and forms an intermolecular b-sheet with the insertion consisting of the b-sheets b6a and b6b (Figure 3(a)). For the different crystal forms, the surface area buried by the formation of the tight dimer varies between ° ° 2700 A2 and 3100 A2 (corresponding to 10 ­12% of the total surface of the two monomers involved). The interaction between the dimers to form the tetramer is purely hydrophobic and involves only a small part of the protein; the buried surface ° amounts to only about 500 A2 and comprises residues from the N-terminal extension of the ba-barrel (Pro30, Ala32, Ala35, Leu36) and the turn between the b-strands b6a and b6b (His230, Val232). The positioning of dimers with respect to each other is similar in all crystal forms of the tyrosine-regulated DAHPS from S. cerevisiae, but markedly different from the arrangement found in the phenylalanine-regulated DAHPS from E. coli (Figure 2(b)). The question of whether this difference corresponds to differences between species or is related to the different regulatory behaviours of phenylalanine-regulated and tyrosine-regulated isoforms awaits the outcome of further investigations.

Subunit structure The individual monomers of DAHP synthase fold as (b/a)8-barrels (Figure 3). Two additional structural elements, which are attached to the are essential for feedback (b/a)8-barrel, regulation.4,9 The N-terminal extension (b0, a0, a00) and the central regulatory domain (b6a, b6b) form a cavity where effector molecules can bind and regulate DAHP synthases. Amino acid residues that are important for effector specificity are located in this cavity.4 The active site of the enzyme is located on the C-terminal face of the (ba)-barrel. The divalent metal cation is anchored by residues located in loops L1, L7 and L8. The substrates interact with loops L2, L4, L6 and L8 (Figure 3(a)). DAHP synthase in complex with Mn21 Depending on temperature, the complex between DAHPS and Mn2þ crystallises in two different crystal forms. At room temperature, monoclinic crystals with two molecules in the asymmetric unit grow; at 4 8C, trigonal crystals with four molecules in the asymmetric unit appear. Between the different crystal forms and between the two monomers forming the tight dimer in the trigonal crystal of the complex of DAHPSSC and Mn2þ, significant conformational differences are found for loops on the C-terminal side of the

In contrast to this flexibility of the majority of the loop regions on the C-terminal side, the metal-binding site itself is made rigid by the metal ion. In all molecules, the metal ion is found in a trigonal bipyramidal coordination, whereby Cys76 Sg and His282 N12 occupy the axial positions and Glu316 O11 and Asp342 Od2 are monodentate equatorial ligands (Figure 4(a); for distances, see Table 2). The third equatorial position stays unoccupied. The monoclinic crystal form diffracted to higher resolution than the trigonal form, so a water molecule (Figure 4(a)), ° located at a distance of 3.3 A from the metal ion, could be identified in the former. This water molecule forms hydrogen bonds to Lys112 Nz and Arg107 Nh2, both of which were later found to coordinate the carboxylate group of PEP (see below). The locations of the metal-binding site and the nature of the coordinating groups in DAHPSSC·Mn2þ are identical with the situation in both DAHPS3 EC and KDO8PSAA.16 The residues corresponding to Cys76, His282, Glu316 and Asp342 in DAHPSSC are Cys61, His268, Glu302 and Asp326 in DAHPSEC, and Cys11, His185, Glu222 and Asp233 in KDOPSAA. The main difference is that in KDOPSAA, and in the DAHPSEC·Pb2þ·PEP-complex, the carboxylate groups of the Glu222AA and Glu302EC coordinate the metal in a bidentate fashion, leading to an overall octahedral coordination sphere for the metal ion. DAHP synthase in complex with PEP and Mn21 or Co21 Crystals of the complexes of DAHPS with PEP and either Mn2þ or Co2þ were obtained by adding the respective metal ions and PEP to protein solutions about half an hour before crystallisation experiments were set up. With a specific activity of 20% and 167% in comparison to wild-type activity, these two metal ions represent the extreme cases of the activity series determined by Schnappauf et al.7 In the PEP complex, both metal ions show the same trigonal bipyramidal coordination as in the substrate-free complex, the third equatorial position being filled by a water molecule, W1 (Figure 4(b)), which acts as a bridge between the metal ion and Lys112. Similar bridging water molecules have been found in both DAPHSEC (to Lys97EC) and the metal-dependent KDOPS from A. aeolicus (to Lys46AA). W1 is also within van der Waals distance of the double bond of PEP, approaching it from the si-side of PEP. The PEP molecule itself is anchored to the enzyme by salt-bridges between its phosphate group and Arg180 Nh1, Lys201 Nz, Arg249 N1, Arg249 Nh2 and a hydrogen bond between a phosphate oxygen atom and Ala179 N. The carboxylate group forms salt-bridges with the two h-nitrogen atoms of the guanidinio-group of Arg107 and with Lys201 Nz (Figure 4(b)). Lys201 Nz also forms a

The angle w between the dimers AB and CD as defined by the angle between the vectors connecting the centres of mass of the pairs of monomers (see (b)) varies between 748 and 798 for all structures investigated here.

third hydrogen bond to PEP O2. These interactions between PEP and the protein are qualitatively the same as the interactions observed by Shumilin et al. for the DAHPSEC·Pb2þ·PEP-complex.3 With respect to the different metal species, Mn2þ and Co2þ, the binding mode of PEP is essentially identical. The distances between the metal ion and its ligands are generally shorter for Co2þ than for Mn2þ (Table 2), reflecting the smaller atomic radius

of the former. As already predicted by Shumilin et al.,3 this coordination of both Mn2þ and Co2þ is qualitatively different from the coordination of Pb2þ. The majority of distances between the four atoms used by Shumilin et al.3 (C1, C2, C3, O1C) to describe the interaction between Pb2þ and the p-electrons of PEP, are significantly longer than ° 4.0 A for the complexes studied here; there is no indication of an interaction between the metal ion

and the p-orbitals of PEP as observed by Shumilin et al. in the DAHPSEC·Pb2þ·PEP-structure.3 The distances measured between the centre of the C1PEP ­C2PEP bond and the centre of mass of the imi° ° dazole ring of His282 are between 3.6 A and 3.7 A, with angles between the imidazole and the PEP planes not exceeding 308. This suggests a p­p interaction between PEP and the imidazole ring of His282 leading to a correct positioning of PEP within the active site as suggested by Shumilin et al.22 Structure of the enzyme in complex with PEP In this metal-free complex (Figure 4(c)), the metal-binding site is occupied by a water molecule, W0. In addition to the ligands normally binding the metal ion, the water molecule is coordinated by a direct hydrogen bond to Lys112 Nz and by another water molecule (W100 ). To accommodate the central water molecule optimally, the ligands are arranged to form an irregular 6-fold coordination sphere in contrast to the trigonal bipyramidal observed for the metal binding. The distances between W0 and the coordinating atoms are larger than the corresponding distances in the metal ion complexes. In particular, Asp342 moves away from the metal-binding pocket and causes a slight backbone displacement of loop L8. Apart from the

missing salt-bridge between the carboxylate group of PEP and Lys112 Nz, the binding partners of the substrate PEP are the same as observed in the complexes between DAHPS with metal cations and PEP. Metal and substrate free crystal structure of the enzyme--DAHPS The structure of the protein without any ligands maintains its overall fold but exhibits considerable flexibility for loops on the C-terminal side of the barrel. Loops L2, L5, L7 (containing His282), and L8 (containing Asp342) do not show interpretable electron density, indicating that PEP or a metal ion is necessary for a defined structure of these regions. Although the differences in surface loop conformations result in a crystal form (triclinic with four molecules in the asymmetric unit) that is different from the other crystals forms, the overall arrangement of the homotetramer stays intact (Figure 2(a)). Structure of the enzyme in complex with Co21, PEP and G3P In comparison with E4P, glycerol 3-phospate is lacking the reactive carbonyl group (Figure 1) and

683 O3E4P (and not O2E4P as proposed by Wagner et al.) would interact with the metal-coordinating aspartic acid residue. Corresponding to O1G3P, the most likely hydrogen partner for O2E4P is Pro113. The importance of Pro113 is underlined by the fact that this residue is conserved throughout all DAHP synthases from E. coli and S. cerevisiae. In KDOP synthases, Pro113 is replaced by a combination of an alanine (Ala47) and asparagine (Asn48), whereby the amide group of the asparagine residue points into the A5P-binding site, providing both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor functions. This dual functionality could be an explanation for the ability of KDOP synthases to accept both A5P and E4P as substrates.14 The high-resolution data available for this crystal structure allowed the refinement of the torsion angle along the C1 ­C2 bond in PEP, resulting in a twist of the carboxylate group of ca 208 in accordance with the recent finding reported by Shumilin et al. for DAHPSEC.22 Single amino acid exchanges at the substratebinding site of yeast Aro4p To corroborate the importance of individual amino acid residues in the catalytic mechanism, three mutant proteins were constructed, in which Lys112, whose amino group forms a bridge between PEP and the metal ion, or either Arg114 or Arg180, whose guanidinio moieties coordinate the phosphate groups of E4P and PEP, respectively, were replaced by alanine. After site-directed mutagenesis, the resulting ARO4 alleles were expressed in the DAHP synthase-deficient strain RH2424 (Mata, can1-100, GAL, aro3 < HIS3, aro4 < LEU2, ura3-1).4 The integrity of the resulting protein was visualised by Western hybridisation experiments (Figure 6A). The enzymatic activity was evaluated by growing cells in media with and without aromatic amino acids present (Figure 6B) and by enzyme assays (data not shown). All three mutant proteins were expressed normally and showed no enzymatic activity. These results clearly demonstrate that Lys112, Arg114 and Arg180 are essential for the catalytic features of DAHP synthase. Alterations in any of these residues are not tolerated and completely abolish DAHP synthase activity.

thus can serve as a mimic to study the binding of E4P without triggering a chemical reaction in the active site of DAHPS. Cryo-cooled crystals of the DAHPSSC·Co2þ·PEP·G3P complex diffract to better ° than 1.5 A resolution, allowing the construction of the most precise structural model for this class of enzymes so far. The statistics of the resulting model and the electron density maps are of high quality (Table 1). The metal ion, both ligands and all residues in the active site are defined by very clear electron density for both molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 5). This equal occupation of all active sites is different from the asymmetry found between different molecules in the same oligomer for KDOPS from A. aeolicus by Radaev et al.15 The binding mode of PEP and the coordination sphere of the metal remain the same as in DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP structure (Figure 4(d)). Notably, this includes the occupation of the third equatorial position of the trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere of the metal ion by a water molecule. The phosphate moiety of G3P forms salt-bridges to the guanidinio group of Arg114 and hydrogen bonds to both Thr115 N and Thr115 Og2 (Figure 4(d)). In addition, the phosphate group is saturated by several coordinating water molecules. This phosphate-binding site coincides with the sulphate-binding site in the structure of DAHPSEC, which was employed by Wagner et al. as a tethering point for modelling the binding of E4P.14,22 Both hydroxyl groups of G3P form strong hydrogen bonds. The hydroxyl hydrogen atom next to the phosphate group, O2G3P (corresponding to O3E4P) forms a bifurcate hydrogen bond with both oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group of the metal-binding aspartic acid residue (Asp342) acting as hydrogen bond acceptors. This interaction leads to a small but significant movement of the aspartate side-chain with respect to the metal ion (Table 2). The other hydroxyl group of G3P, O1G3P (corresponding to O2E4P) makes a strong hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Pro113 ° (2.7 A). In addition to these direct interactions between G3P and the protein, there is a watermediated (via W1') contact between O2G3P and both the phosphate group of the first substrate PEP and the guanidinio group of Arg180. Interestingly, in the structure of DAHPSSC·Co2þ·PEP a molecule of glycerol (from the cryo-protecting buffer) was found bound in the same site, also forming a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Asp342. In contrast to the situation in KDOPSAA, where loop L7 contains 18 residues that cover the binding site of A5P upon binding of substrate, the substantially shorter loop L7 of DAHPS (ten residues) does not interact with G3P, leaving part of the active site solvent-accessible after binding of G3P. Although the movement of the metal-coordinating aspartic acid residue upon E4P binding as observed here had been predicted in the model proposed by Wagner et al.,8 the binding mode of G3P shows a hydrogen-bonding scheme where

Discussion
Overall rigidity and flexibility Comparison of the 24 monomers in four different crystal forms allows the division of DAHP synthase into a rigid and a flexible part (Figure 3(a); and see Materials and Methods). With the exception of helix 6, the secondary structure elements forming the ba-barrel region are rigid with respect to all conformers seen in this study. The two a-helices contained in the N-terminal extension are rigid as well, whereby the

The uracil auxotrophy of yeast RH2424 (ura3-1, Daro3, Daro4; control) was complemented by the URA3 marker of various high copy number plasmids differing in the open reading frame, which is driven by the MET25 promotor. pME2528 (ARO3) and pME2529 (ARO4) carry the wild-type ARO3 and ARO4 open reading frames, respectively. pME2542 (ARO4 K112A), pME2004 (ARO4 R114A), pME2543 (ARO4 R180A) carry mutant alleles with Ala substitutions for codons Lys112, Arg114 and Arg180, respectively. A, Expression of the resulting proteins was verified by Western blot analysis of crude extracts where 2 mg of proteins were loaded onto each lane and visualized by an anti Aro4p antibody. For the loading control, 20 mg of each extract was loaded onto each lane and visualised by an anti Cdc42p antibody.

sections of the chain that form the intermolecular b-sheet (b0, b6a, b6b) are, in part, flexible. A big contrast is seen between the loops located on the N and C-terminal face of the barrel: the N-terminal side is mostly rigid, whilst all loops on the C-terminal side, with the exception of loop L1, show flexibility either by assuming different conformations

in different models or by lacking continuous electron density in some crystal forms. Structural role of the metal ion and PEP All isoenzymes of DAHP synthase require a divalent metal ion for activity and the type of

metal ion influences kcat as well as the apparent affinity to E4P.6 Our results suggest that the metal plays both a structural and a catalytic role. The comparison of the structure of DAHPSSC alone and its complex with Mn2þ shows that binding of the metal ions results in a generally more stable structure, as indicated by decreased B-values (Figure 7) and the ordering of a number of loop regions (blue versus red curve in Figure 7). These loops include regions that are directly involved in metal binding and regions that are later involved in substrate binding. In particular, loop L7, which contains the metal-coordinating residue His282 and for which no electron density was found in the uncomplexed structure, becomes clearly visible in the electron density for the metal complex (Figure 7). Similarly, loops L5 and L6 that comprise residues involved in the binding of PEP undergo a transition into a well-defined conformation. In contrast to the PEP-binding site, the loop involved in E4P binding (L2) remains disordered. This observation and the fact that the DAHPSSC·Mn2þ complex can form two different crystal forms (whereby in one of the crystal forms the four crystallographically independent molecules are found in different conformations) shows that the protein does not become completely rigid on the binding of a metal cation. The remaining flexibility may be necessary to allow the active site to switch between active and inactive forms upon effector binding. A similar ordering effect is observed when PEP alone is bound to DAHPSSC. In contrast to the metal binding, the binding of PEP, via interactions of PEP with Arg107 and Lys112, affects an ordering of loop L2 that provides the binding pocket for E4P (see below). Again, some flexibility remains, as indicated by the fact that it was only possible to model the protein chain continuously from residues 23 to 369 in one out of the eight molecules present in the crystal structure of DAHPS·PEP. The simultaneous presence of Mn2þ or Co2þ and PEP leads to a substantial overall decrease in B-factors (Figure 7), indicating a further stabilisation of the entire protein molecule. Apart from loop L8, which contains two of the metal-coordinating residues, the conformation assumed by the protein is

identical, within experimental error, with the conformation assumed when the E4P analogue G3P is also bound. Two possible sources for the anomeric oxygen of DAHP Since the release of inorganic phosphate occurs by cleavage of the C2 ­O2PEP bond in contrast to the more common cleavage of the P ­ O2PEP bond33, the hydroxyl group of the product DAHP must originate from bulk solvent. In agreement with the observations for DAHPSEC22 and KDOPS,16 we have identified two water molecules that are in sufficiently close contact to PEP to participate in the reaction: W1 and W3 (Figures 4(c) and 8). W3 is located on the re-side of the double bond at a dis° tance of 3.1 A from C2PEP (Figure 8) and is positioned by strong hydrogen bonds to Glu158 ° (2.8 A) and to a second, well-localised water mol° ecule, W2 (2.7 A). W3 is found in all complexes, independent of the presence of a metal ion or substrates. W1, the second water molecule in a position to participate in the reaction, is localised on the si° side of the double bond at a distance of 2.7 A from ° C3PEP and 3.1 A from C2PEP, and forms a hydrogen ° bond to O1PEP (2.5 A) (Figure 8). This water can only be localised in structures that contain both a metal ion and PEP (i.e. DAHPS·Mn2þ/Co2þ·PEP, DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P). In addition to the interaction with PEP itself, it is held in position by inter° actions with the metal ion (2.1 A) and Lys112 Nz ° ), an atom belonging to an essential amino (2.7 A acid residue. Despite the large number of interaction points, the B-value of W1 is significantly higher than the average for other atoms in the active site, e.g. in the DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P-complex the B-values for the two copies of W1 are ° ° 30.1 A2 and 30.7 A2, while PEP, G3P and Co2þ have ° a mean B-value of 19.0 A (Table 1). Such mobility is not consistent with a strong interaction with the metal ion required to reduce the pKa of W1 sufficiently for the creation of a hydroxide ion to initiate the reaction.

E4P binding Comparison of the DAHPS·Mn2þ/Co2þ·PEP and the DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P complexes shows that the binding of a metal ion and PEP leads to a general ordering of the protein as indicated by the overall decrease in B-values. It results in a conformation that is essentially identical with the conformation after binding of G3P and thus prepares the protein for the binding of E4P. The only backbone movement caused by the binding of G3P is a slight repositioning of loop L8 comprising the two-carboxylate ligands, Glu316 and Asp342, of the metal (Table 2). This rearrangement in the metal coordination is a consequence of the strong hydrogen bond between O2G3P and Asp342, and can be considered as a carboxylate shift34 preparing the metal ion for its role in the catalysis. We have modelled a bound E4P molecule (Figure 9) based on the assumption that the binding of G3P to DAHPS correctly reflects the binding of E4P from the phosphate group to C2E4P and O2E4P inclusively. As the C2 atom of E4P is chiral, the positions of C1G3P and O1G3P in the DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P complex the position of C1E4P can be predicted with great certainty. In the ° resulting position, C1E4P is 2.7 A away from the C3 atom of PEP. This distance is too short for two non-bonded carbon atoms, but is consistent with the fact that C1E4P and C3PEP will form a bond during the course of the reaction. Given the positions for C2E4P and C1E4P, the only degree of freedom left for the carbonyl oxygen atom of E4P is the torsion angle around the C2E4P ­ C1E4P bond. Most values of this torsion angle can be excluded due to steric clashes with the double bond or the phosphate group of PEP, the hydroxyl group on C2 of E4P itself and the side-chain of Asp342. The only position for the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of E4P, which is not affected by unfavourable sterical interactions, is approximately the position of the metal-coordinating W1 molecule. At this position, the oxygen atom of the carbonyl

group of E4P coordinates the metal ion with a dis° tance of 2.4 A, allowing the carbonyl group to be activated by the metal ion and to be positioned optimally for a stereo-selective nucleophilic attack of the re-side of PEP onto the si-side of the CvOE4P double bond. The angle for the nucleophilic attack by the double bond is ca 958 and thus ¨ close to the energetically favourable Burgi­ Dunitz-angle of 1038.23 Given the immediate interaction of the carbonyl group with the metal ion, differences in the type of metal will clearly have strong effects on the affinity of the enzyme to E4P and its activity as described by Stephens.6 Interestingly, a carboxylate shift induced by the strong interaction between O2E4P with the carboxylate group of Asp342 would indirectly support the activation of E4P's own carbonyl group. When replacing W1, a second important interaction of the carbonyl oxygen atom of E4P is a hydrogen bond to Lys112 Nz which is an important player in catalysis, as shown in mutagenesis experiments: an Aro4p mutant protein carrying the Lys112Ala substitution resulted in a stable protein lacking any detectable DAHP synthase activity. Even overexpression of the mutant allele resulting in enzymes with the corresponding amino acid substitutions could not complement the aromatic amino acids auxotrophy of a DAHP synthase-deficient yeast strain (Figure 6). Lys112 potentially interacts with both PEP and E4P via its Nz atom, thus defining the relative position of both substrates. The observed binding mode of G3P is consistent with the observation made by Sheflyan et al., that DAHPS can process a substrate that is one carbon atom longer than it natural substrate E4P but not one carbon atom shorter or two carbon atoms longer.19 With respect to substrates shorter than E4P, binding of the phosphate group in the same mode as the phosphate group of G3P will preclude the positioning of the C1 carbonyl sufficiently close to the metal atom simply because the saccharide moiety is too short. To test the ability of DAHPS to

Active Site of DAHP Synthase from S. cerevisiae

accommodate substrates longer than E4P, A5P was modelled into the active site employing the same method as for E4P, i.e. using the G3P-equivalent part as a tethering point and modifying only torsion angles. As before for E4P, this simple approach allowed us to position the carbonyl oxygen atom of A5P in the location of W1, providing it with essentially the same chemical environment consisting of the metal ion and the amino group of Lys112 as described above for the model of E4P. In reality, the precise position of the A5P carbonyl group will depend on the way in which the atoms connected to the additional carbon atom (C2) in the sugar chain can be accommodated in the active site, thus explaining the differences observed in kinetic properties for related five-carbon atom monosaccharides differing in the functionalization of the C2-atom.19 Implications for the reaction mechanism The replacement of W1 that is coordinated only weakly to the metal ion by the carbonyl group of E4P would clearly favour a reaction mechanism starting with the nucleophilic attack of the p-electrons of PEP from the si-face onto the re-face of the metal-activated aldehyde group of E4P (route A in Figure 1). Such an attack is consistent with the observed stereochemistry of the product. After the bond between C1E4P and C3PEP has been formed, the proton necessary to convert the carbonyl oxygen atom of C1E4P to a hydroxyl group can be provided by the side-chain of the essential Lys112 residue. Being hydrogen bonded to W1 in the DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P complex, the amino group of the lysine side-chain is in fact in an ideal position to participate in this step as a general acid. After losing one proton, the then uncharged Lys112 Nz will interact less strongly with the carboxylate group of PEP, allowing the reaction intermediate a greater maneuverability within the active site. In the next step, a hydroxide ion produced from a water molecule positioned on the re-side of PEP, W3, attacks the oxocarbenium ion, utilising the carboxylate group of Glu158 ° (2.8 A from W3) as the general base to store the surplus proton. W4, which is present in all structures determined here and forms hydrogen bonds ° with both the carboxylate group of Glu158 (2.8 A) z ° ), can then function as a and N of Lys112 (2.8 A relay to transfer the proton back to the currently uncharged Lys112. The double role of the essential residue Lys112 in providing a proton to form the hydroxyl group and in accepting the proton left over from the attack by the water molecule W703 resolves the problem that DAHP synthases do not possess the equivalent of His83AA (corresponding to Leu162SC in DAHPSSC). This amino acid had been proposed to act as the final proton acceptor for the abduction of the proton from the equivalent of water molecule W3 in KDOP synthases.16 The subsequent cleavage of the C ­O and the

formation of the carbonyl group of DAHP involves another transfer of a proton to the phosphate group. This proton can be provided by Lys201, ° whose Nz atom is positioned at 2.9 A from O2PEP (Figure 8). In KDOP synthases, in the metal-independent forms in particular, the initial activation of the carbonyl group of the monosaccharide may not be as important as for DAHP synthases. Since in KDOP synthases, due to the absence of the very strong salt-bridges between the guanidinio group of Arg107 and the carboxylate group of PEP seen in DAHP synthases, the nucleophilic character of C3PEP is maintained13 and thus can, partly, drive the reaction. However, in DAHP synthase, where C3PEP is less nucleophilic due to the neutralisation of the carboxylate group of PEP, the metal ion provides a means to activate the other partner of the condensation reaction, the carbonyl group of E4P, thus maintaining the overall reactivity. The alternative start of the reaction by the metalassisted creation of a hydroxide ion from a water molecule (route B in Figure 1) involves the complication that a general base is needed in the active site for accepting the proton liberated at the very beginning of the catalytic cycle. It has been suggested that the metal-coordinating histidine can play this role.24 However, the protonated histidine residue would need to disengage from the metal ion. This would involve a relatively large movement of a considerable number of non-hydrogen atoms and would lead to steric problems for the approach of E4P to PEP.14 Furthermore, a reaction starting from a metal-activated water molecule produced on the si-side of PEP results in a syn addition of water to C2PEP and of C3PEP to C1A5P, which has been considered unusual by several authors, e.g. see Shumilin et al.22 In the light of the structural results presented here, it can be seen that for a mechanism following route A in Figure 1, the only mobile entities apart from the substrates and the products are protons, and none of the non-hydrogen atoms in the protein have to undergo large movements. The importance of proton transfers in the reaction is underlined by the fact that both lysine residues involved are highly conserved throughout DAHP synthases and in both metal-dependent and metal-independent KDOP-synthases. Furthermore, the general base Glu158 is conserved throughout DAHPS synthases, whereas in KDOP synthases, the general base is provided by an equivalent aspartate side-chain.15 Mutational experiments will allow the assessment of the importance of these residues. Furthermore, the way the binding of the effector tyrosine alters the active site, and how these alterations relate to the recently elucidated conformational changes triggered by the binding of phenylalanine to the phenylalanine-regulated DAHP synthase from E. coli22, awaits the determination of further crystal structures.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and crystallisation For expression of the Aro4p enzyme, strain RH13265 (ATCC:204132) was transformed with the multicopy plasmid pME1200, which is a derivative of pJDB20725 carrying an Xba I/Bam HI ARO4 fragment. The protein was isolated from this strain and purified as described.5,7 During purification, all solutions contained 10 mM EDTA to remove metal ions. Crystals were obtained by using the hangingdrop, vapour-diffusion method. For this procedure, 2 ml of protein solution (13 ­ 18 mg/ml, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5­ 9) was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a reservoir solution containing various amounts of PEG3400 (9 ­ 17%, w/v), 5% (v/v) glycerol and 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5­ 9). Crystals of the trigonal form grew at 4 8C over a period of seven days. All other crystal forms reported here were crystallised within several days at room temperature. All complexes resulting in triclinic crystal forms were crystallised with a large excess of metal ions and substrate (5 mM) in the reservoir solution. In all cases, the first crystals obtained at room temperature were too small for diffraction experiments; thus, several steps of micro and macro seeding followed the first round of crystallisation. Complexes in space group C2 and P3121 were obtained by treating the protein solution half an hour before crystallisation with small excess of metal ion and substrate or analogue, respectively (2.5 equiv.). Generally, the crystals in space groups C2 and P3121 were much more stable and useful for diffraction experiments than crystals in the crystal form P1. Amino acid substitutions in yeast Aro4p For site-directed mutagenesis of the ARO4 gene, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used.26 The resulting ARO4 alleles were ligated as Bam HI/Xho I fragments into pME1513,27 a highcopy plasmid with MET25 promoter and URA3 as selective marker, which lead to the plasmids pME2542 (Lys112Ala), pME2004 (Arg114Ala) and pME2543 (Arg180Ala). The ARO4 alleles were verified by DNA sequencing.28 Transformation of S. cerevisiae strain RH2424 (MATa, can1-100, ura3-1, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, aro3 < HIS3, aro4 < LEU2)4 was carried out by the LiOAc method.29 Transformed strains were selected on synthetic complete (SC) medium50 without uracil and growth was tested on minimal vitamins medium30 with and without phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. In addition, liquid cultures were grown on minimal vitamins medium. For yeast crude extract preparation, cells were harvested in mid-exponential phase at an A546 of 3 ­ 4. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Hartmann et al.31 DAHP synthase activities were measured as

described by Takahashi & Chan32 but with modifications described by Schnappauf et al.7 Data collection and processing All data were collected from single crystals held at 100 K. For low-temperature data collection, the concentrations of PEG3400 and glycerol were increased simultaneously in steps of 5% to concentrations of about 20% each. To prevent diffusion of ligands out of the crystal, the cryoprotectant solutions contained the respective metal ions, substrates or analogues in concentrations somewhat higher than in the buffers used for crystallisation. Diffraction data sets were collected either in a stream of gaseous nitrogen from a home-made cryo-apparatus at 100 K on a MAR345 imagingplate detector using CuKa radiation from a rotating anode and an Osmic mirror system or on beamlines X11, BW7B and BW7A at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). The data were integrated and scaled with DENZO and Scalepack,35 and merged with XPREP (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI). Processing statistics are summarised in Table 1. Structure solution and refinement For structure solution by molecular replacement, one monomer of the structure of DAHPS in complex with PEP,4 pdb entry 1HFB, was used as a search model after removing water molecules, substrates and side-chains of the active site. Depending on the space group, the appropriate number of DAHPS dimers was placed using the program EPMR36 or MOLREP.37 Initial refinement was performed with CNS 1.038 employing the maximumlikelihood target function. Model bias originating from the search model was minimised by one cycle of high-temperature simulated annealing using torsion angle dynamics. For later stages of refinement, REFMAC39 from the CCP4 suite40 of programs was used. Between refinement cycles, models were checked against sA-weighted 2Fo 2 Fc and Fo 2 Fc electron density maps and rebuilt in Xfit.41 Substrates and their analogues were included in the model with their stereochemical parameters restrained to standard values as given in the CNS libraries, where available, and with values derived from searches in the Cambridge Structural Data Bank42 otherwise. After refinement, all structures were analysed with the programs PROCHECK43 and WHAT IF.44 Refinement statistics are summarised in Table 1. As PEP has been found to be distorted in C216 or twisted around the C1 ­ C2 bond,22 the torsion angle along the C1PEP ­ C2PEP bond was not restrained in the high-resolution refinement of DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P. NCS restraints and TLS models were used only in the case of the structure of DAHPS itself, with four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. All other refinements

were performed without NCS restraints and with restrained isotropic B-factors, the only exception being the structure of DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P, where the high resolution of the data allowed the refinement of restrained anisotropic B-factors with REFMAC. Structure analysis and comparison The seven crystal structures presented here contain a total of 24 crystallographically independent conformers of DAHP synthase. First, error-scaled difference distance matrices45 for Ca atoms were analysed and this allowed the identification of a set of seven non-redundant models representing all conformers present in the ensemble. These seven conformers (1OFP-A, 1HFB-B, 1OFQ-C,D, 1OFA-B and 1OF8-A,B) were then scanned for the conformationally invariant part using the computer program ESCET.46 At the 2s level, the following Ca atoms were identified as defining the part of the molecule that is rigid with respect to the conformers discussed here: 29 ­ 109, 133 ­159, 163 ­176, 189­ 198, 215 ­222, 228, 230­ 247, 273­ 280, 289 ­ 321, 347 ­ 368. Within the seven non-redundant conformers, the r.m.s.d. values for the superposition of the 222 conformationally invariant Ca atoms onto the B-chain of the DAHPS·Co2þ·PEP·G3P model var° ° ied between 0.116 A and 0.322 A. The flexible parts of the molecule are marked in Figure 1. Figures were produced using MOLSCRIPT,47 BOBSCRIPT,48 Raster3D49 and DINO (Philippsen, A. (2001)).
