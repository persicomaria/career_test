SUMMARY. Two variants of pro-urokinase (pro-UK), All_32pro-UK lacking the first and the second loops (Cys"-Asn3' within the EGF-like domain and A3wzpro-UK lacking the third loop (Cy~~~-Cys~` were produced ) ), in Chinese hamster ovary cells. They were compared with natural pro-UK (n-pro-UK) and A10-42pro-UK lacking entire EGF-like domain (Hiramatsu et al' in terms of clearance rate and biochemical properties. ) Fihrinolytic activity half-lives of these mutants in rat circulation after holus administration were 7.1 min for All_32pro-UK and 6.8 min for A3-2pro-UK, which were about 3.5 times longer than that of n-pro-UK (2.0 min) and slightly shorter than that of A 1w2pro-UK (7.6 min). The amidolytic activity of these deletion mutants were 10-4M, and 8.4-10.0x lo3 min-` , almost the same as n-pro-UK in terms of both Km and kcat (3.440~ respectively), suggesting that the protease domain was not affected by the deletion in EGF-like domain. It was also found that the binding ability to fibrin-celite was decreased by the absence of the third loop of the EGF-like domain. In addition, conversion from the single chain form to the two chain form by the action of plasmin was slowed in proportion to the size of the deletion in the EGF-like domain.

Pro-urokinase (pro-UK) is an inactive or extremely low activity single chain precursor of the active two chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (tcuPA),2-5 which is widely used in thrombolytic therapy. UK converts plasminogen into plasmiq6 a broad spectrum serine protease, which, in turn, digests fibrin, fibrinogen, pro-UK and many other proteins. The UK catalysed degradation of fibrinogen results in a systemic bleeding tendency in clinical use. In addition, UK is inactivated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-l (PAI-1),7 PAI-2,s or PAI-3" in circulation, which necessitates the administration of a large amount of UK. In contrast, pro-UK does not form a complex with any of the PAIs7-' and pro-UK activation may take place around fibrin because of its fibrin selectivity.4~10~' Pro-UK is therefore expected ' to bring improved efficacy to thrombolytic theras PY. 12-` One drawback to the use of pro-UK is its rapid clearance from circulation,4"y-21 necessitating continuous infusion of a large amount of the protein 12-17

Pro-UK consists of three structural domains, the EGF-like, kringle and serine protease domains.22-25 As we reported previously, there is evidence suggesting that pro-UK is recognized and cleared by hepatic cells interacting with the EGF-like domain.2628 We demonstrated that deletion of the EGF-like domain from the pro-UK molecule prolongs its half-life in circulation.' Furthermore, the binding study of pro-UK to rat hepatic cells strongly suggested the presence of a UK-specific receptor, and this binding was found to be disrupted by deleting EGF-like domain from pro-UK (in preparation). The EGF-like domain is composed of three loop structures formed by disulfide bonds; the first loop (amino acids 11-19)) the second loop (amino acids 20-31)) and the third loop (amino acids 32-42).25 Using the monocyte cell line, U937, which expresses the UK receptor on its surface, the receptor binding region of pro-UK was found to reside within the second loop of the EGF-like domain.2" In this paper, we report the preparation of two pro-UK mutants having partially deleted EGF-like domains in order to study the detailed relationship between the structure of pro-UK and its plasma half-life. One was A, 1_32pro-UK, a mutant lacking the first and second loops, from Cys"-AsnS2, and the other was A3_u2pro-UK, lacking the third loop, from

variants were purified and characterized, and their pharmacokinetics and biochemical properties were examined in comparison with natural and Aiw2pro-UK.

Plasma Clearance Each pro-UK was labelled with ` 25iodine using lactoperoxidase enzymobeads (DuPont/NEN, USA). The specific activities were 2-8 x lo6 cpm/p.g of protein. Male Wistar rats (7-weeks-old) were anaesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg i.m.) and Ketalar (35 mg/kg i.m., Sankyo, Tokyo). A mixture of 2~10~ IU of unlabelled and 2~10~ cpm of radiolabelled pro-UK or pro-UK mutants per kg were administered as a bolus through a tail vein. Blood samples of 0.3ml were obtained from a cannulated carotid artery at the times indicated (l-20 min) and mixed with 30~1 of 3.8% trisodium citrate. Plasma samples were prepared in order to measure fibrinolytic activity using bovine fibrin plates.30 Pharmacokinetics was followed both by the fibrinolytic activity in plasma and by the radioactivity in blood. Half-life, distribution volume (Vd), and the area under the curve from l-20 min. (AUCi_20 min) were obtained from the plot of fibrinolytic activity versus time and from the plot of radioactivity versus time. Binding Ability to Fibrin/Celite In order to compare the affinity of pro-UKs to fibrin, the adsorption of pro-UKs onto a fibrin-celite column was investigated. Bovine plasminogen-free fibrinogen was coupled to celite by the method described elsewhere.31 1 ml of 2x lo4 III/ml pro-UK dissolved in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), was applied to 5ml of fibrin-celite which was previously equilibrated with buffer A (50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1mM EDTA, 100mM NaCl). After washing the column with 59ml of buffer A, bound protein was eluted with buffer B (buffer A containing 0.2M arginine). The absorbance of the eluate at 280nm was monitored and 2ml fractions were collected. The plasminogen activator (PA) activity of each fraction was measured on a fibrin plate, and the adsorption rate was calculated by the formula, 100 [%] X (PA activity of the fractions eluted with buffer B)/(PA activities of all fractions). Treatment with Plasmin To investigate the rate of conversion of the single chain form of pro-UK to its active two chain form, each pro-UK was treated with plasmin. The pro-UK (final concentration 200 IU/ml) was incubated at 37°C with plasmin (final concentration 0.025 casein units/ ml) in assay buffer (O.lM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, O.lM NaCl, 0.05% sodium azide, 1% gelatin). At timed intervals (O-20 min), 100 ~1 aliquots were taken into 100~1 of 300 KIU/ml aprotinin in the assay buffer. After 8OOl~lof 0.125 mM Glt-Gly-ArgMCA dissolved in the assay buffer was added, each aliquot was incubated at 37°C for 20 min, and the UK activity was determined by fluorospectrophotometry at 470nm using an international reference preparation as the

MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of pro-UK Mutants The amino acid and nucleotide numbering of pro-UK follow Nagai et al.29 We depleted nucleotides 28-131 (corresponding to amino acids 10-44) from pro-UK cDNA, and created a new CZaI site at the junction point between amino acids 10 and 45. Oligonucleotides (corresponding to both strands of the DNA coding for either amino acids 10-32, 43 and 44, or amino acids 10 and 33-44) were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Model 382A), annealed, and inserted into the new CIaI site in the pro-UK cDNA. The sequences were as follows: SD7,40 mer; 5' -CGAACTGCCCAAAGAAATTCGGAGGGCAGCACTGTGAAAT-3' , SD8,40 mer; 5' -CGATTTCACAGTGCTGCCCTCCGAATTTCTTTGGGCAGTI-3' , SD9,76 mer; 5' -CGAACTGTGACTGTCTAAATGGAGGTACCTGTGTGTCCAACAAGTACTTCTCCAACAI-ICACTGGTGCAACGAAAT-3' , and SDlO, 76 mer; 5' -CGATITCGTTGCACCAGTGAATGTTGGAGAAGTACTTGTTGGACACACAGGTACCTCCATTIAGACAGTCACAGTT-3' . The final products were the A, i_32pro-UK expression vector, pMR304, and the Ass-42pro-UK expression vector, pMR305. They were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Purification of pro-UK and pro-UK Mutants Natural and mutant pro-UKs were purified as described previously. ' Purified n-pro-UK and modified pro-UKs were subjected to sequencing on an automated gas-phase sequenator (Applied Biosystems, Model 470A), as described previously.' Amidolytic Activity 100 ul of 200 IU/ml pro-UK was activated with 100 l.rl of 0.2 casein units/ml of plasmin by incubating at 37°C for 10 min in assay buffer (O.lM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.05% sodium azide, 1% gelatin). Then 800~1 of either 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 or 0.0625mM glutaryl-glycyl-L-arginine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7amide (Glt-Gly-Arg MCA) dissolved in the assay buffer and prewarmed at 37°C was added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 3 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2.0ml of 15% acetic acid. Fluorescence spectrophotometry with excitation at 370nm and emission at 460nm was performed to estimate the concentration of 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) produced by the enzymatic reaction.

N-pro-UK, AIW2pro-UK, Arr_s2pro-UK, and Ass_ 42pro-UK were purified individually by immunoaffinity chromatography. These purified samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis along with molecular weight standards and recombinant pro-UK (Fig. 2). Natural and mutant pro-UKs migrated as a single band under both reduced and non-reduced conditions, demonstrating that these molecules were present as a single chain form.

The Km and k,,, of each mutant is similar to those of n-pro-UK. Therefore, it was concluded that the amidolytic activity remained unchanged by deletion of a part of the EGF-like domain of the pro-UK molecule.

The plasma time courses of pro-UK and its deletion mutants are shown in Figure 4. Each deletion mutant remained in circulation longer than the wild-type pro-UK, whether radioactivity or fibrinolytic activity was followed. Since radioactive degradation products were released from the liver, the radioactivity in circulation increased again about 10-15 min after injection. The half-life (TI,z~L), the distribution volume (Vd) and the area under the curve (AUC1_2a min) were calculated from the clearance curve and summarized in Table 2. These values for each deletion mutant were significantly different from those of n-pro-UK. The half-lives of the mutants were 4 times longer than that of pro-UK. Compared with pro-UK, a 3.4 times smaller Vd and 13 times larger AUC were obtained for Alu+zpro-UK, while 2 times smaller Vds and 8 times larger AUCs were found for Arr_s~- and Ass_ 42pro-UKs. Thus, deletion of the EGF-like domain from pro-UK was found to give a significant effect on pharmacokinetics. The effect of a partial deletion was less than that of the entire deletion.

The fibrin affinity of pro-UK and its deletion mutants were estimated by binding to a fibrin-celite column. The results are shown in Table 3. When either n-pro-UK or A33-42pro-UK was applied on the column, no PA activity was detectable in any fractions washed with buffer A under the condition employed. On the other hand, when either A33-42proUK or A11-42pro-UK was tested, some PA activity was observed in every fractions washed with buffer A, as well as eluate fractions. Since n-pro-UK and A,,_s,pro-UK retain the third loop of the EGF-like domain while A3s_42pro-UK and Ara+zpro-UK do not, the third loop of the EGF-like domain seems to

be important for the fibrimcelite binding of pro-UK. The third loop of the EGF-like domain resides next to the kringle domain, which is thought to confer binding affinity for fibrin on the basis of the analogy between pro-UK and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). 32-34Therefore, the loss of the third loop of the EGF-like domain might result in a more significant conformational change in the kringle domain than that caused by a deletion of the first and second loops.

n-pro-UK, A1r-s2pro-UK, Ass-42pro-UK, and Ala._ 42pro-UK, respectively. AlcM-42pro-UK and hi 1-s2proUK showed significantly longer half-lives (about 60%) p<O.Ol and about 15%) ~~0.05, respectively) compared to that of n-pro-UK, while the half-life of AsH2pro-UK was same as that of n-pro-UK. Thus, the conversion from the single chain form to the two chain form was found to be influenced by mutations in the EGF-like domain and became slowed in proportion to the size of the deletion. DISCUSSION Pro-UK is cleared from circulation mainly in liver.20,36,37The specific receptor for pro-UK plays an important role in its hepatic clearance.20 We previously reported that pro-UK might be recognized by its receptor through the EGF-like domain because the deletion of the EGF-like domain of pro-UK resulted in retardation of its plasma clearance.' In this paper, we carried out further analysis of the structure-function relationships of the EGF-like domain, with attention to its three loop structure. As shown in Table 2, partial deletion of the EGF-like domain (A1a-32pro-UK and As3-42pro-UK) as well as complete deletion (A1cr-42pro-UK) resulted in a mutant pro-UK with slower plasma clearance than n-pro-UK. There are two possible explanations for this result. First, the receptor binding site within the EGF-like domain of pro-UK resides in the first and second loops, but the third loop is necessary to maintain the conformation properly, or vice versa. This hypothesis agrees with the observation of Appella et a1,26 who reported that the binding of pro-UK to the receptor on the monocyte-like cell line, U937, takes place with the second loop of the EGF-like domain. Second, that receptor recognition regions exist independently in both the first and second loops and the third loop. As to Vd, all three mutant pro-UKs showed smaller Vds than that of n-pro-UK (Table 2). Because the molecular weights of these proteins are in the range of 47-50kd (Fig. l), the physiologically diffusable volume of each protein in the rat should be similar. Therefore, these results suggest that the uptake of pro-UK by the liver was reduced by the deletion of a part of the EGF-like domain. Not only the plasma clearance but also the binding ability to fibrin/celite and the conversion rate from the single chain form to the two chain form were influenced by deletions in the EGF-like domain. It was found that the presence of the third loop of the EGF-like domain of pro-UK is important for the binding ability of pro-UK to fibrin/celite. Since the kringle domain, which is responsible for the fibrin affinity in the case of tPA,32-34 is located next to the EGF-like domain, deletion of the third loop of the EGF-like domain may distort the conformation of the kringle domain. However, it is uncertain whether the third loop of EGF-like domain physiologically plays a

role on fibrin binding of pro-UK, because Gurewich et al reported that pro-UK has no fibrin affinity,38 on the basis of the findings that pro-UK is not incorporated into fibrin during the clot formation3g.40 nor pro-UK does not bind to the preformed clot.4' The results in Figure 5, and half-lives of single chain form of each pro-UK calculated from this plot show that the conversion rate was decreased according to the size of the deletion in the EGF-like domain. It was reported that the activation rate of low molecular weight single chain urokinase, which lacks EGF- and kringle domains, was 3 or 4 times slower than that of pro-UK. 42 Pro-UK is cleaved to its two chain form by plasmin at the peptide Lys' 5"-Ile' 5g bond,35 which is located far from the EGF-like domain in the primary structure of pro-UK. How can deletion of the EGF-like domain disturb plasmin cleavage of the peptide bond between Lys' 58-Ile159? One explanation is that distortion of overall molecular structure caused by the deletion, made plasmin' s approach to the attack site more difficult. Another possibility is that the EGF-like domain has a direct interaction with plasmin or the plasmin cleavage site of pro-UK, and plays some role in the conversion from the single chain form to the two chain form. Deletions in the EGF-like domain influenced not only the plasma half-life but also functions thought to be exerted by other domains. We concluded that each domain structure of pro-UK is not independent in terms of both function and structure. REFERENCES 1. Hiramatsu R, Kasai S, Amatsuii Yet al 1989 Effect of
