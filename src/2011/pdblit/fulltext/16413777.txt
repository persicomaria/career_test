Abstract--Highly potent, selective, and bioavailable inhibitors of human, mouse, or rat cathepsin S are described. The key structural features combine a sulfonyl moiety attached to a large group in P2 and a small substituent in P3. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cathepsin S (Cat S) is a cysteine protease that belongs to the papain superfamily.1 It is most highly expressed in antigen presenting cells and can be induced by a number of mediators in different cell types. Cat S has substrate activity against many proteins, in particular the MHC class II invariant chain (Ii), as well as extracellular matrix proteins including elastin and collagen.2 Cat S has been implicated in a wide range of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, neuropathic pain,3 and a number of autoimmune disorders.4 The identification of a potent, selective, and bioavailable Cat S inhibitor is therefore a valuable goal as it would allow the evaluation of the pharmacology due to Cat S inhibition and hence the therapeutic potential of such an inhibitor. The crystal structure of human Cat S with and without inhibitors has been solved.5 These data and our molecular modeling studies revealed that there are three significant differences between Cat S and Cat K in the S2

subsite. Using the numbering from PDB entry 1MS6 (Cat S) Gly137 and Gly165 are both Ala in Cat K. The resulting two extra methyl groups effectively act as `gate keepers' to the S2 subsite in Cat K, whereas in Cat S the absence of these two methyl groups opens up the subsite both in terms of width and depth. The third difference is found at the end of the S2 subsite. In Cat K the subsite is terminated by a Leu group, however, in Cat S the residue is Phe211 which is directed up and out of the active site so that the end of the S2 subsite is not bound. As a result of these three differences it is expected that the S2 subsite in Cat S will accept significantly larger groups compared to the S2 subsite found in Cat K and this should provide a key to achieving selectivity between these two enzymes. In a recent Letter,6 we described L-873724, a Cat K inhibitor in the trifluoroethylamine series. Although this compound is a potent and selective inhibitor of Cat K, we thought that it would make an ideal starting point to identify a Cat S inhibitor seeing that it is reversible, non-lysosomotropic, and orally bioavailable (Fig. 1). Our strategy was to replace the P2 leucine by cysteine, or serine, and use the heteroatom suitably located as a linker to quickly derivatize and probe the steric and

electronic requirements in S2. To achieve this, we developed a stereoselective reductive amination of 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenones and cysteine or serine derivatives (Scheme 1).7 In all cases, the reduction yielded a mixture of diastereoisomers obtained in a ratio of $10:1 favoring the desired (S,S)-diastereoisomer. Following coupling (HATU) with aminocyclopropanecarbonitrile, the cysteinamides were oxidized to the sulfone (MMPP or Na2WO4/n-Bu4HSO4/H2O2). For the approach using serine, the hydroxyacid obtained from reductive amination was first transformed to the aminocyclopropanecarbonitrile derivative followed by conversion of the hydroxyl group to the bromide (CBr4/PPh3P). SN2 displacement with mercaptans (K2CO3/DMF) provided the sulfides (oxidized as above). In all cases, simple trituration in MTBE (or diethyl ether) provided the (S,S)-diastereoisomer in a ratio of $25:1.

We initiated our SAR study with the simple methylsulfonylcysteinamide derivative in P2 and 4-bromophenyl derivative in P3 (R = SO2CH3; Y = Br) as we envisaged using the bromide to eventually explore other P3 substitutions (see Table 1). This combination produced 2, a relatively potent inhibitor of human Cat S with weak selectivity against Cat K (Cat K/S $3-fold). The sulfide 3 and sulfanyl 4 were significantly less active against Cat S. This clearly established the preference of a sulfonyl moiety in P2.8 We then tried to fill the S3 pocket by preparing the 4-fluorobiphenyl derivative 5 (obtained via Suzuki coupling reaction). Although this compound is still a potent inhibitor of Cat S, it is also potent against Cat K and Cat B. On the contrary, replacing bromine by fluorine provided 6, showing a 6-fold increase in potency against Cat S and over 200fold selectivity against Cat K, B, and L. The reduced size of the S3 pocket in Cat S has previously been observed from crystal structures of Cat S inhibitor complexes.5 In addition, the preference for a large P3 substituent in S3 of Cat K has already been established in our previous Letter.6 The optimal position of the fluorine at the para position is demonstrated with the preparation of the meta-fluoro derivative 8, an inhibitor 3.5-fold less potent and significantly less selective against Cat K. Finally, replacing the halogen by hydrogen provided a potent inhibitor 9, which also suffered from erosion of the Cat S/K selectivity (56-fold). The steric requirements in P2 were next evaluated. The isobutyl and cyclopropylmethyl derivatives 10, 11, and 12 (Y = F or H) provided subnanomolar inhibitors of Cat S. Moreover, these analogs are very selective against Cat K and B and at least 100-fold selective against Cat L. Molecular modeling performed with 10 clearly indicated that while Cat S accom-

Selectivity against Cat K and Cat B could be further improved by replacing these P2 aliphatic substituents by benzyl groups. As exemplified with 13­17, substitution around the phenyl ring was well tolerated in the Cat S active site but not in the Cat K active site. Thus, the 2,6-dichloro analog 16 was completely inactive against Cat K and B while being 350-fold selective against Cat L. Substitution on the benzylic carbon was not tolerated: the gem-dimethyl derivative 18 was essentially inactive compared to 13 ($2000-fold). We also explored direct attachment of the aryl to the sulfone moiety. The 4-fluoro-, 4-bromo-, and 3-bromophenylsulfonyl derivatives 19, 20, and 21 although potent against Cat S suffered from significant erosion of the selectivity against Cat K. Replacement of the simple phenyl moiety by heteroaromatics was explored with the thiazolyl and benzothiazolyl derivatives 22 and 23, both of which lost potency against Cat S. Further investigation of the substitution pattern for halophenyl derivatives finally led to the 3,4-dichlorophenyl derivatives 24 and 25 which

offered an excellent profile of potency and selectivity. Both derivatives have IC50s of 0.2 nM against Cat S, are more than 1000-fold selective against Cat K and B and are 100- to 200-fold selective against Cat L. Taken all together, these results establish that potent and selective inhibitors of Cat S require the combination of a critical sulfonyl moiety attached to a large group in P2 and a small substituent in P3, preferentially located in the para position (Table 1). This SAR study allowed the identification of several potent and selective inhibitors of human Cat S. However, to support rodent disease models, we needed to evaluate these compounds for their inhibitory properties against mouse and rat enzymes. Data for representative compounds are listed in Table 2. With mouse enzymes, all compounds retained their potency at inhibiting Cat S (IC50s 6 1.6 nM, except for 7 which is inactive across all species) and selectivity versus other cathepsins (P250-fold). However, some potent inhibitors of human and mouse Cat S were generally weak inhibitors of rat Cat S. This is notably the case for 6 and 12 which are 700- and 1000-fold less active against the rat enzyme, respectively.12 Our molecular modeling studies suggest that these variations are attributable to structural differences in the S2 active sites. In particular, two simultaneous side chain differences increase the lipophilic interactions between P2 and S2 in rat Cat S (compared to mouse or human). When performing molecular dynamic simulations on a homology model of the rat enzyme (obtained from a human Cat S crystal structure) we observed that the Phe212Tyr and Val163Met differences between human and rat in S2 confer an increased stability for the conformation of the rat Tyr212 in which the phenyl is pointing toward Thr73.13 In this position, the phenyl ring hydroxyl group forms two H-bonds with Thr73, an interaction not possible in the mouse and human enzymes. As a result, in rat, S2 forms a cavity offering an advantageously favorable lipophilic interaction with an

aromatic ring such as the benzyl derivative 15 or the phenyl derivative 20. Ultimately, extensive SAR around the aromatic moiety allowed the identification of 24, a potent inhibitor of rat Cat S, essentially inactive against rat Cat B and 3-fold selective against rat Cat L. In summary, our SAR study identified several potent and selective inhibitors of either human, mouse, or rat Cat S. Based on its overall profile of activity and selectivity, 6 appears to be an optimal inhibitor of human or mouse Cat S, while 24 is preferred as a rat Cat S inhibitor. The pharmacokinetic profiles of some inhibitors were evaluated in rats (see Table 3). Compounds 2 and 6, bearing a simple methyl derivative in P2, had good bioavailability, high Cmax, and relatively long t1/2. However, analogs such as 10 and 12 suffered from either poor bioavailability, shorter t1/2, and/or reduced Cmax. To gain insight into the pharmacokinetic profile of these inhibitors, we examined their metabolic profiles in fresh rat hepatocytes after incubation for 2 h at 37 °C.14 As opposed to 2 and 6 which were found to be stable under these conditions, 10 and 12 generated several metabolites, presumably via an oxidative pathway, resulting in de-alkylation and ultimately leading to the corresponding sulfinic and sulfonic acids. The benzyl derivative 15, presumably also suffering from benzylic oxidation, had limited absorption and short t1/2. This could be addressed with the 3,4-dichlorophenyl derivatives 24 and 25 which provided an acceptable pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile. In addition, the exposures of compounds such as 6 in rodents were found to be non-linear which can seriously limit the evaluation of the pharmacology due to Cat S inhibition. For example, in C57BL/6 mice, dosing orally a 0.5% methocel/0.2% SDS suspension of 6 at 5 and 50 mg/kg resulted in AUCs of 43 and 111 lM * h (0­24 h), respectively. To address this issue, we identified a sulfoxide prodrug 7, which is rapidly converted

Cat S, 6 is preferred. However, interspecies variations were observed and potent rat Cat S inhibitors require an aromatic P2 moiety extending to an even more lipophilic cavity in S2, as is the case with 24. In mice, 6 is highly potent in a cell-based assay of antigen presentation and causes a large increase in splenic MHC II invariant chain p10 levels, demonstrating high efficacy at inhibiting Cat S. The pharmacological outcomes of inhibiting Cat S in rodents will be the subject of subsequent reports. References and notes

in vivo to the parent sulfone 6. In mice, the plasma AUC exposures of 6, dosed as 7, at 10, 50, and 150 mg/kg are 63, 274, and 750 lM * h (0­24 h). In addition, for chronic in vivo studies, mice can be most conveniently dosed using 7 in food. At doses of 0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.25 (w/w)% of 7 in regular rodent diet, the plasma AUC exposures of 6 are 7, 31, and 87 lM * h (0­24 h) after 5 days of dosing. Peak blood levels (6 am, lights on, mice start feeding less actively) were 1, 6, and 16 lM. Trough levels (6 pm) were 0.3, 2, and 3 lM. Therefore, the food formulation of 7 avoids the large peak to trough variation observed with BID dosing that is required for complete coverage, reduces the risk of offtarget activity, and provides a significant simplification compared to multiple daily gavages. The ability of 6 to inhibit Cat S was evaluated in two immune function-related assays. The first assay determines the ability of 6 to block the presentation of antigen by an engineered mouse B cell line to a responsive T cell hybridoma.9 The second measures the accumulation of a 10 kDa fragment (p10) in mouse spleen which results from the inhibition of proteolytic digestion of the MHCII invariant chain peptide (Ii).15 In the mouse antigen presentation cell-based assay, 6 has an IC50 of 44 nM. The irreversible inhibitor LHVS, 26, and the Cat K inhibitor L-873724 have IC50 values of 1.2 and 4814 nM, respectively, demonstrating that 6 is highly efficacious in this assay. For the in vivo p10 accumulation assay, C57BL/6 female mice were fed a food formulation containing 0.01 (w/w)% of 7 for 5 days (corresponding to approximately 3 mg/kg/day based on food consumption). Following the treatment period, analysis of p10 levels in spleen lysates showed $24-fold accumulation vs vehicle. After returning a second cohort of mice to a regular diet for 3 days, analysis of the spleen lysates indicated that p10 levels had returned to levels comparable to that of vehicle treated animals. These results indicate that a high degree of reversible Cat S inhibition is achieved with 6.9 In summary, highly potent and selective inhibitors of human, mouse, and rat Cat S were identified. The key structural features combine a critical sulfonyl moiety attached to a lipophilic substituent in P2 and a small substituent in P3. For the inhibition of human or mouse
