Laccases (E.C. 1.10.3.2; benzenediol oxygen oxidoreductases) are members of the blue multi-copper oxidase family. They catalyse four one-electron oxidations of a reducing substrate and couple this to the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water and are characterized by their broad speci®city for the reducing substrate. They are able to catalyse the oxidation of a number of aromatic (normally phenolic) and inorganic substances È (Malmstrom et al., 1975; Xu, 1996; Xu et al., 1996). Laccases have been isolated from a wide variety of fungal and plant sources and have been extensively studied by spectroscopic and kinetic techniques (for example, Reinhammar, 1984; Solomon et al., 1996; Xu, 1996; Xu et al., 1996). Laccase homologues now also appear to be widespread in bacteria (Alexandre & Zhulin, 2000). The broad substrate speci®city of laccases is re¯ected in a variety of biological roles. They are involved in the wound response È in plants (Malmstrom et al., 1975), both the synthesis and degradation of lignin (Ander & Eriksson, 1976; Bao et al., 1993; Kersten et al., 1990; Thurston, 1994) and are believed to play roles in pathogenesis, sporulation and the development of fruiting bodies (Leatham & Stahmann, 1981; Thurston, 1994). Laccases are increasingly being used in a wide variety of industrial oxidative processes (see, for example, Schneider et al., 1999; Xu, 1996; Xu et al., 1996). Laccase is the simplest member of the blue multi-copper oxidase family, which includes ascorbate oxidase and mammalian plasma È ceruloplasmin (Adman, 1991; Malmstrom et al., 1975; Messerschmidt, 1997a,b; Messerschmidt et al., 1992; Zaitseva et al., 1996). The different copper centres in these proteins are characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques (reviewed in Holm et al., 1996;

Solomon et al., 1996, 1997). They contain a minimum of one type 1 (T1) copper, bound as a mononuclear centre which shows a characteristic intense absorption band at 600 nm which results from the S3Cu(II) charge transfer. The T2 site behaves as a mononuclear site with normal spectral features and is hence EPR active. Together, the T2 and T3 sites form the trinuclear centre which is the site for the reduction of dioxygen. Laccases readily release a single Cu atom under favourable conditions (Frank & Pecht, 1986; Malkin et al., 1969). It is widely, although not universally (Fraterrigo et al., 1999), assumed that the labile Cu is the EPR-active T2 Cu from the native enzyme. This Cudepleted species is thus referred to as the T2D laccase and has been the study of much spectroscopic investigation. We have previously described the structure of the T2D C. cinereus Ê laccase at 2.2 A resolution (Ducros et al., 1998). Here, we report the structure of the C. cinereus Ê laccase at 1.68 A resolution with data collected at 100 K. Conformational plasticity in the T2/ T3 site reveals the existence of at least two structurally distinct isoforms of the type 2 depleted laccase as a result of two discrete conformations for His399.

2. Experimental methods
Crystals of laccase were grown from polyethylene glycol 8000 as precipitant at pH 5.5 in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, essentially as described previously (Ducros et al., 1997) but without EDTA in the deglycosylation buffer. The catalytic viability of the sample used for crystallization was demonstrated by its ability to polymerize phenolic compounds (data not shown). A single crystal of laccase was mounted in a rayon-®bre loop and placed in a boiling nitrogen stream at 100 K. A cryoproDucros et al.

tectant solution was produced consisting of 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 30%(v/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and ethylene glycol to a ®nal concentration of 20%(v/v). Data were collected using a MAR Research image-plate system together with a Cu rotating-anode generator and utilizing long focusing-mirror optics (Yale/Molecular Structure Corporation). Data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993; Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). All further calculations used the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The previous cross-validation re¯ections, Ê between 15 and 2.2 A, were maintained for Ê the 1.68 A re®nement and extended to the full resolution limit. The structure was re®ned using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) with solvent added in an automated manner using ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993) and veri®ed through manual inspection. is a monomeric molecule consisting of three tightly associated cupredoxin-like domains, yielding a globular structure with approxÊ imate dimensions of 70 Â 50 Â 45 A (Fig. 1), similar to other blue multi-copper oxidases (as reviewed in Murphy et al., 1997). The mononuclear T1 copper is located in domain 3, where it is bound by two histidines and a cysteine, whilst the trinuclear centre is located at the interface between domains 1 and 3. The blue T1 copper site is the site binding the primary reducing substrate. In all multi-copper oxidases and cupredoxins of known three-dimensional structure the T1 Cu is coordinated by two histidine N atoms and a cysteine S atom, with the highly covalent Cu±SCys bond giving rise to the pronounced blue coloration. Some multicopper oxidases, such as ascorbate oxidase, possess an axial methionine ligand, with the Ê SD atom approximately 2.9 A from the Cu atom, which modi®es the properties of the T1 centre (most recently discussed in Palmer Ê et al., 1999). The 1.68 A C. cinereus laccase structure reveals an essentially identical T1 site to that reported previously, albeit at greater precision (Ducros et al., 1998). The T1 copper is trigonally coordinated to the S atom of Cys452 and the ND1 N atoms of His396 and His457, with bond lengths of Ê 2.19, 2.07 and 2.03 A, respectively. The Cu atoms lie exactly in the plane of the C and N ligands and the axial position is occupied by Ê Leu462 at a distance of 3.51 A from the Cu. No electron density is observed for the loop

3. Results and discussion
As part of an industrial screening process for oxidative enzymes, the C. cinereus laccase was ®rst identi®ed, expressed and characterized because of its powerful catalytic activity at high pH (Schneider et al., 1999). The three-dimensional structure was Ê reported at 2.2 A using room-temperature data (Ducros et al., 1998) and is presented Ê here from crystals at 100 K to 1.68 A resolution (details in Table 1).

The Cu atoms are shown as shaded spheres, with the T1 site in blue and the T3 pair in yellow. This ®gure was produced using MOLSCRIPT/BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997; Kraulis, 1991) and rendered using Raster3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997; Merritt & Murphy, 1994). The ®gure is in divergent (wall-eyed) stereo.

which forms the base of the T1 site (residues 160±164) in the 100 K study. Ê The most interesting feature of the 1.68 A structure is the insight it gives into potential T2D isoforms at the trinuclear centre. The T2/T3 site of the C. cinereus laccase contains eight histidine ligands as expected for a Ê multi-copper oxidase, but in both the 2.2 A Ê 100 K study we observe study and the 1.68 A no electron density corresponding to the putative type 2 Cu atom (Fig. 2a). The putative T2 copper is lost completely, whilst the T1 and T3 pair remain at full occupancy. The two T3 Cu atoms are separated by Ê approximately 5.3 A in the T2D laccase, Ê compared with the 3.7 A observed in the oxidized form of ascorbate oxidase. The oxygen-containing ligand, possibly water, binds to just one atom of the T3 pair and is asymmetrically disposed between the two Cu atoms, lying approximately 2.17 and Ê 3.26 A from Cu3(a) and Cu3(b), respectively (Fig. 2b). It no longer `bridges' the T3 pair. One copper of the T3 pair shows a distorted trigonal planar conformation consistent with observed X-ray absorption edge features and its likely reduction to a Cu(I) species (Kau et al., 1987; LuBien et al., 1981). It is coordinated to His66, His109 and His453 Ê and 3.26 A distant from the bridging ligand. The other Cu shows two distinct different coordinations as a result of the multiple conformations of His399. Conformational changes involving His399 (whose equivalent is a T2 copper ligand in ascorbate oxidase and ceruloplasmin)

accompany T2 Cu depletion and it shows two distinct conformations. In the ®rst conformation it remains in the same position observed in ascorbate oxidase and ceruloplasmin; thus Cu3(a) has four ligands, three N atoms from His111, His401, His451 and the oxygen-containing ligand, at distances of Ê 2.01, 2.04, 1.98 and 2.17 A, respectively. This coordination is best described as distorted tetrahedral. In the second position, His399 has swung into the coordination shell of Cu3(a) which becomes pentacoordinate with Ê a 2.5 A bond to His399 (Fig. 2b). The relative occupancies of the two positions for His399 are different in the 100 and 293 K structures, leaving one to believe that the two species clearly lie in an equilibrium which is suf®ciently well poised so as to be in¯uenced by changes in temperature, crystallization conditions etc. tence of a number of different T2D isoforms (for example, Frank & Pecht, 1986) and the crystal structure discussed here indeed reveals at least two T2D isoforms. Furthermore, whilst it is widely believed that the loss of the EPR signal from the T2D laccase results from the depletion of the labile T2 copper, McMillin and colleagues (Fraterrigo et al., 1999) have recently questioned the evidence that the depleted copper is actually the EPR-active species. Instead they propose that the loss of the EPR signal may simply re¯ect conformational changes upon loss of copper, such as observed here. Such proposals could have profound implications for spectroscopic interpretation and mechanistic schemes. The Structural Biology Laboratory at York is supported in part by the BBSRC.

4. Conclusions
The most commonly studied derivative of blue multi-copper oxidases is the type 2 depleted form in which the labile Cu has been selectively removed. It is signi®cant that there is strong evidence as to the exis-
