Summary The origin-binding domain of the gpa protein of phage P4 (P4-OBD) mediates origin recognition and regulation of gpa activity by the protein Cnr. We have determined the crystal structure of P4-OBD at 2.95 Å resolution. The structure of P4-OBD is that of a dimer with pseudo twofold symmetry. Each subunit has a winged helix topology with a unique structure among initiator proteins. The only structural homologue of the P4-OBD subunit is the DNA-binding domain of the eukaryotic transcriptional activator Rfx1. Based on this structural alignment, a model for origin recognition by the P4-OBD dimer is suggested. P4-OBD mutations that interfere with Cnr binding locate to the dimer interface, indicating that Cnr acts by disrupting the gpa dimer. P4-OBD dimerization is mediated by helices a1 and a3 in both subunits, a mode of winged helix protein dimerization that is reminiscent of that of the eukaryotic transcription factors E2F and DP. This, in turn, suggests that Cnr is also a winged helix protein, a possibility that is supported by previously unreported sequence homologies between Cnr and Rfx1 and homology modelling. Hence, in a mechanism that appears to be conserved from phage to man, the DNA-binding activity of winged helix proteins can be regulated by other winged helix proteins via the versatile use of the winged helix motif as a homo- or heterodimerization scaffold. Introduction The replication of viral, plasmid and cellular DNA is initiated from a discrete DNA site called an origin of replication (Kornberg and Baker, 1991). The initiation from origins is governed by origin-binding proteins (OBPs) or initiators, which play two critical roles (Edwards et al., 1998): (i) OBPs facilitate local distortion or unwinding of the origin DNA; and (ii) OBPs nucleate the assembly of DNA replication apparatus through specific interactions with other replication proteins. Much knowledge about the initiation and control of DNA replication comes from studies on bacteriophage or plasmid (Bramhill and Kornberg, 1988; Del Solar et al., 1998). These studies have revealed a remarkable variety of replication mechanisms. Yet, replication in these systems appears to be regulated solely at the stage of initiation. Phage P4 is an 11.6 kb small defective temperate virus of Escherichia coli, which can be propagated in different ways in the host cell (Lindqvist et al., 1993; Ziegelin and Lanka, 1995; Briani et al., 2001). In the presence of the helper phage P2, phage P4 can enter either the lytic cycle or the lysogenic state. In the absence of the helper, P4 can either be maintained as a high-copy-number plasmid or integrate its genome in the host chromosome and confer the immune-lysogenic condition. Replication of phage P4 is dependent on three phage-encoded elements: the origin (ori1), a cis replication region (crr) and the product of the a gene, gpa (Ziegelin et al., 1993). Both the ori1 and the crr, which are ª 4.5 kb apart, contain ATrich regions and several octameric repeats, called type I iteron, in direct and inverted orientation (Ziegelin et al., 1993). The trans element, gpa, binds specifically to those iterons within the two cis elements, ori1 and crr. In vitro, P4 DNA synthesis starts at ori1 in a bidirectional q-type manner (Diaz-Orejas et al., 1994). However, crr is indispensable for the initiation from ori1. Host replication

856 H.-J. Yeo et al. proteins required for P4 phage DNA replication in vivo include DnaE (the a subunit of DNA pol III holoenzyme) and SSB (Ziegelin et al., 1993; Ziegelin and Lanka, 1995). By requiring only a few host proteins for its replication, phage P4 is unique among temperate phages. The gpa protein (84.9 kDa, 777 amino acids) of phage P4 is a multifunctional protein with DNA (or origin)binding, helicase and primase activities (Fig. 1A) (Ziegelin et al., 1993; 1995; 1997a). The DNA-binding activity maps to the C-terminal ª 150 residues of the protein and is specific for the six and 10 repeating iterons (TGTTCACC) of ori1 and crr respectively (Ziegelin et al., 1995; 1997a). The primase activity is located in the N-terminal half of the protein, and this part of the protein is related in sequence to primases of conjugative plasmids (Strack et al., 1992). The primase domain contains the consensus motif ­ EGYATA- and a potential Zn2-ion binding site that is present in many known prokaryotic primases (Strack et al., 1992). The primase and origin-binding domains can function independently of one another (Strack et al., 1992). The helicase activity is marked by a Walker type A nucleotide-binding motif located in the middle of the protein (Ziegelin et al., 1997a). The helicase domain overlaps with the C-terminal DNA-binding domain (Ziegelin et al., 1997a). The helicase activity of the a protein unwinds DNA with 3¢ Æ 5¢ polarity, which is in contrast to other well-characterized prokaryotic replication systems (Ziegelin et al., 1993; 1997a). The gpa protein is a dimer in solution; however, it is not known whether this assembly state is important for function or is the predominant form once bound to cis-acting elements. The DNA-binding domain of the protein is also the site of interaction with the phage-encoded protein Cnr (Copy number regulator) (Terzano et al., 1994; Ziegelin et al., 1997b). The P4 Cnr protein encoded by the gene orf106 modulates the activity of gpa when P4 propagates as a plasmid (Terzano et al., 1994). The gene orf106 is located immediately upstream of a and, thus, the two genes are transcriptionally co-regulated (Terzano et al., 1994). Deletion of the P4 gene cnr causes P4 DNA over-replication and cell killing, thus preventing P4 propagation in the plasmid state (Terzano et al., 1994; Tocchetti et al., 2001). Overexpression of Cnr leads to inhibition of P4 DNA replication (Terzano et al., 1994). Previously, we have isolated P4 gpa mutants resistant to the inhibitory action of Cnr (gpacr; gpa Cnr resistant) (Ziegelin et al., 1997a). All such mutants are impaired in plasmid propagation and locate within the DNA-binding domain. Cnr appears to exert its action by interacting directly with gpa. Cnr increases the affinity of gpa for ori1 and crr in vitro, and appears to interfere with dimerization of gpa (Ziegelin et al., 1997b). Here, we present a study of the DNA-binding domain of gpa. We focused on the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, because this region is not only essential for origin recognition, the very first step in the replicative process, but is also the site of gpa regulation by Cnr. The crystal structure of the P4 origin-binding domain was solved by a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method. It is unique among origin-binding proteins in that its fold and structure share similarities with those of the eukaryotic transcription factor Rfx1, a winged helix protein that itself has an unusual DNA-binding mode (Gajiwala et al., 2000). We also show that the P4 origin-recognition domain is a constitutive dimer with a dimerization interface unique among replication initiator proteins, in that it involves the a-helical bundle of the winged helix motif in a configuration similar to that of the eukaryotic transcription factor EF2-DP heterodimer (Zheng et al., 1999). These observations, together with the unambiguous mapping of Cnr binding to the dimerization interface of the domain, suggest a model for Cnr regulation of gpa function.

Results and discussion Delimitation of the minimal gpa-ori1 binding domain ori1 binding has previously been assigned to the Cterminal amino acids 625­766 of gpa (Ziegelin et al., 1995; 1997a). A series of deletions of this segment was constructed to delimit the minimal gpa-ori1 binding domain further (see Experimental procedures). To increase solubility and facilitate purification, we fused each gpa derivative to a His6-thioredoxin (th) tag (LaVallie et al., 1993). All activities of the gpa protein, i.e. ori1 binding, primase, ATPase and helicase, are retained in gpa-th whether tested in vitro or in vivo (Ziegelin et al., 1997a). The various gpa-th protein fragments were analysed for specific complex formation with ori1 DNA by fragment retention in gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Most of the Cterminus is required for specific origin binding. GpaD 1.5-th lacking the very C-terminal 11 residues (gpa positions 767­777) forms complexes with ori1 specifically. However, removal of further residues resulted in loss of ori1 binding (Fig. 2). DNA-binding activity of a construct (gpaD4.11-th) containing the C-terminus of gpa from residue 674 was reduced, whereas no DNA binding was observed when shortening gpaD4.11-th further from its Nterminus (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that amino acid residues 664­766 (corresponding to gpaD4.10 in Fig. 2) are sufficient for ori1 complex formation. Limited proteolysis of gpaD4.10, crystallization and structure determination Initially, gpaD4.10 was used for crystallization. However, sizeable high-quality crystals could not be obtained. GpaD4.10 was then submitted to limited proteolysis using

several proteases. All proteases produced a similar fragment (results not shown). Trypsin digestion yielded a slightly smaller and stable C-terminal domain corresponding to residues 671­777 as assessed by N-terminal sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry. We refer to this fragment hereafter as P4-OBD (Figs 1B and C). P4-OBD binds DNA. Light scattering measurement indicated that P4-OBD is a dimer in solution (result not shown). P4-OBD crystallized in the trigonal space group P3121 with three P4-OBD dimers per asymmetric unit. The structure of P4-OBD was solved using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion of selenomethionine-containing crystals. P4-OBD contains five methionines and, therefore, 30 selenium sites were expected in the asymmetric unit. All the expected selenium sites were located using the program SOLVE (see Experimental procedures). Experimental phases to 3.0 Å were calculated and subsequently

improved by solvent flattening, yielding an electron density map of excellent quality (Fig. 3A). The present model contains 100 residues from Asp-671 to Lys-770. The last seven residues are disordered and are known to be dispensable for DNA binding/replication (Fig. 2). The current model has an R-value of 23.7% and free R-value of 28.4% at 2.95 Å resolution (Table 1). Overall structure of P4-OBD The monomer structure of P4-OBD has a mixed a/b topology consisting of four a-helices and three b-strands arranged in order a1­b1­b1¢­a2­a3­b2­b3­b3¢­a4. (Figs 3B­D). The overall fold of P4-OBD is that of the winged helix subfamily of helix­turn­helix (HTH) proteins (Gajiwala and Burley, 2000). Briefly, winged helix proteins include a large number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcription factors (Gajiwala and Burley, 2000). The winged

helix structural motif is a compact a/b structure consisting of three a-helices and three b-strands. Two extended loop structures termed `wings' 1 and 2 or W1 and W2 are located one between strands 2 and 3 and the other at the C-terminus of the protein. The order of secondary structural elements is a1­b1­a2­a3­b2­W1­b3­W2. The fold of P4-OBD distinguishes itself from this typical winged helix arrangement by containing only one wing, W1 between b2 and b3, and by containing an a-helix, a4, at the C-terminus. The structure of P4-OBD is very similar to that of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of human Rfx1 (hRfx1; PDB entry code 1dp7), a regulatory factor X protein that acts as a transcriptional regulator of gene expression in humans (Gajiwala et al., 2000; and Fig. 4). In fact, a search for structural homologues of P4-OBD using the program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1998) returned a very high score of Z = 8.5 (Z = 24 for the self-alignment of the P4-OBD structure) for the DBD of Rfx1. Rfx1 aligns with P4-OBD with an r.m.s. deviation in Ca atoms of 1.7 Å over 70 residues. As is apparent in the structural alignment presented in Fig. 4B, helices a1, a2 and a3, in both structures, superimpose very well. However, P4-OBD differs from hRfx1-DBD in that P4-OBD contains a more extended loop between b1¢ and a2, and also contains an additional helix (a4) at its C-terminus. The fold of P4-OBD is not unique among initiator proteins, yet the structure of P4-OBD does not align with any other origin-recognition domains of known structure. For example, the prokaryotic replication initiator protein, RepE of F factor, which binds origin sequences as a monomer, contains two winged helix domains related to each other by an internal pseudo twofold symmetry (Komori et al., 1999). The most prominent features of a winged helix

protein are its DNA-binding helix and its DNA recognition wing 1 (Gajiwala and Burley, 2000). These are easily recognizable in both RepE and P4-OBD. Yet, when these are aligned locally, one is hard pressed to recognize any similarities between RepE and P4-OBD in other parts of the structures. Hence, structural homology between P4-OBD and RepE or any other OBDs (see Hegde et al., 1992; Bochkarev et al., 1995; Luo et al., 1996; Enemark et al., 2000) is limited to the two signature structures of winged helix proteins. The P4-OBD dimer P4-OBD is also unique among OBDs in the manner in which two P4-OBD units assemble to form a dimer. The asymmetric unit of the P4-OBD crystals contained three dimers, yielding three independent views of the dimer interface. Each subunit in the P4-OBD dimer is related by a twofold symmetry axis (Fig. 5A). The surface area buried at the interface is 1320.5 Å2. The dimer interface is mostly hydrophobic in nature. Participating residues are located in two regions: one region consists of the a1 helix and the N-terminus; the other includes the a3 helix. Details of the interactions are presented in Fig. 5C. The hydrophobic core of the interface (Leu-724, Met-728, Leu-731, Met-736, Val-735) is decorated on the outside by charged residues such as Asp-673 and Glu-739, which contribute to the interface mostly through their hydrophobic moiety. However, charge clashes are also observed between these residues and could have a destabilizing effect. These may facilitate disruption of the dimerization interface by the Cnr protein (see below).

Secondary structures are shown as in Fig. 3C and are located either below (hRfx1-DBD) or above (P4-OBD) the corresponding primary sequence. Residues in the primary sequence of hRfx1-DBD that interact with DNA are shown in red. The residues of the P4-OBD monomer (P4-OBD1) that was used for the structural superposition shown in (B) and are in the vicinity of the modelled DNA shown in cyan in Fig. 6B are indicated in red. Also in red are the residues of the second subunit of the P4-OBD dimer (indicated as P4-OBD2) that are in the vicinity of the modelled DNA shown in cyan in Fig. 6B. The P4-OBD subunit (P4-OBD1) that was used for the structural superposition shown in (B) is the one indicated in orange in Figs 5 and 6. Hence, P4-OBD2 refers to the other subunit in the P4-OBD dimer, which is shown in yellow in Figs 5 and 6. B. hRfx1-DBD is in blue, and P4-OBD1 is in cyan.

The OBD of Epstein­Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), a protein that serves as origin-recognition protein during viral replication, forms stable dimers both in solution and bound to DNA (Bochkarev et al., 1995). However, the dimer interface is mediated by an eightstranded antiparallel b-barrel, composed of four strands from each monomer (Bochkarev et al., 1995). Although RepE forms a monomer upon origin recognition, RepE dimers are observed in solution and when bound to the repE gene operator (Komori et al., 1999). Mutations disrupting RepE homodimerization are located in b-strands 2 and 3, not in the a-helical bundle part (Matsunaga et al., 1997). Moreover, in the RepE monomer bound to an origin DNA, the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains (which, as explained above, form two very similar structures related by a pseudo twofold internal symmetry axis) involves residues in the a2 helix (Komori et al., 1999). Only in the heterodimer formed by E2F and DP, which are two human transcription factors that play important roles in the expression of cell cycle genes, is the interface between the

two proteins formed by residues in the a1 and a3 helices of the winged helix fold (Zheng et al., 1999). Interestingly, the interface between E2F and DP has an approximate twofold symmetry (Zheng et al., 1999). Rfx1-DBD is a monomer in the absence of DNA. In the presence of DNA, two Rfx1 molecules bind co-operatively. The structure of the Rfx1-DBD­DNA complex shows that there is no protein­protein contact between the two Rfx1DBD subunits and that co-operative binding is therefore probably the result of through-DNA effects (Gajiwala et al., 2000). Therefore, although the P4-OBD monomer is structurally similar to the DBD of Rfx1, the dimerization mode of the two proteins is very different. Another feature of the P4-OBD dimer is its amphipathic character: the distribution of charges is clearly bipolar (Fig. 5B). One side is acidic (Asp-673, Glu-683, Glu-716, Glu-737, Glu-739, Glu-761, Glu-762 and Asp-766; Fig. 5B, right). The opposite side (where the b2­b3 loop or wing W1 lies) is positively charged (Fig. 5B, left). The latter surface most probably contains either parts or the

entire binding site for DNA. Superposition of the structure of P4-OBD and that of the DNA-bound form of DBD-hRfx1 confirms the location of the DNA binding site to this area of the structure (Fig. 6 and discussion below). Cnr interaction with gpa The P4 Cnr (Copy number regulator) protein functions as a negative regulator of P4 replication in the plasmid state (Terzano et al., 1994). It modulates the activity of the gpa protein by disrupting gpa homodimerization (Tocchetti et al., 2001). Complexes of gpa and Cnr bind DNA with higher affinity than gpa alone (Ziegelin et al., 1997b). Cnr binding to gpa, however, does not affect the helicase and primase activities of gpa in vitro. Thus, Cnr appears to exert its biological activity by promoting the formation of a tight gpa-Cnr­DNA complex that sequesters gpa to the origin of replication and prevents it from progressing along the DNA (Ziegelin et al., 1997b).

That P4-OBD is the target of Cnr was suggested by a screen of P4 mutants that are able to escape regulation by Cnr (Cnr-resistant gpa or gpacr) (Ziegelin et al., 1997b). Five mutants were identified: T675M, G732V, G732W, L733V and L737V (Fig. 3; Ziegelin et al., 1997a). These mutants all map to the dimerization interface of P4-OBD (Figs 5C and D). Thus, Cnr is indeed likely to exert its action through disruption of the dimer interface formed by the DNA-binding domains of two gpa molecules and by binding to this interface to form a hetero Cnr-gpa dimer. Of the four sets of substitutions that abolish interaction with Cnr, two mutations, L733V and L737V, map to the hydrophobic core region of the P4OBD monomer. Thus, the conserved substitution to valine could potentially be accompanied by a readjustment in the hydrophobic core of the monomer that may lead to structural changes at the interface sufficient to disrupt Cnr interaction with gpa. Another mutation, T675M, affects a residue that is part of the dimer interface (Fig. 5). Clearly,

The structure of the hRfx1-DBD­DNA complex was superposed onto that of the P4-OBD subunit in orange. For clarity, the protein part of the hRfx1DBD­DNA complex was then removed. Such superposition places the DNA (in blue) in a seemingly favourable binding position on the subunit in orange. The superposed DNA in blue clashes somewhat with the other P4OBD subunit in the dimer (shown in yellow line ribbon). However, a slight reorientation of the DNA (the `modelled' DNA in cyan) alleviates these clashes. B. The asymmetric mode of origin recognition by the P4-OBD dimer. Residues in the vicinity of the modelled DNA (see A) are represented in stick representation colour coded in red for oxygens, blue for nitrogens and dark grey for carbons. DNA binding on the monomer in orange is similar to that observed in hRfx1DBD. The corresponding region in P4-OBD constitutes the hypothesized `primary DNA binding site' (see text). Binding on the monomer in yellow involves not only the primary DNA binding site but also a secondary binding site composed of residues in the C-terminal end of helix a3 (Lys-738) and in the N-terminal end of strand b2 (Asn743). These two residues are shown in red in the P4-OBD2 sequence in Fig. 4A. C. The two observed conformations of Arg747 in the primary DNA binding sites of the two P4-OBD subunits. The orange subunit is superimposed onto the yellow subunit, and only the b2­b3 loop (W1 wing) is shown. Arg747 in the orange subunit (colour coded as in B but with carbons in light grey) adopts a very different conformation in the subunit in yellow (colour coded as in B but with carbon atoms in dark grey). However, both conformations could be productive for DNA binding.

a methionine at this position would result in a local change in the composition and shape of the dimer interface. As this mutation affects Cnr binding, the dimer interface must overlap with the site of Cnr interaction. Finally, the most redundant mutation that renders gpa resistant to Cnr action affects G732. This residue lies within the hydrophobic region of the dimer interface, and mutations to Val (G732V) or Trp (G732W) would affect the chemistry

and configuration of the interface. Hence, we must conclude that the site of Cnr interaction with gpa locates to the dimer interface of the P4-OBD dimer. Interestingly, none of these mutations affects gpa homodimerization (Ziegelin et al., 1997a). Hence, although these mutations are sufficient to alter gpa­Cnr interaction, they do not alter the interface sufficiently to prevent gpa dimerization.

Regulation of DNA-binding activity by homo- and heterodimerization 863 Interaction of P4-OBD with DNA The structure of hRfx1-DBD is strikingly similar to that of P4-OBD. Thus, the mode of DNA binding by P4-OBD is likely to be similar to that of hRfx1-DBD. HRfx1-DBD is an exception among winged helix proteins in that many of the contacts made with the DNA involve residues in the b2­b3 or W1 loop (Gajiwala and Burley, 2000; Gajiwala et al., 2000). Compared with other winged helix proteins, helix a3 (the `helix' in the winged helix motif) plays a minor role. In Fig. 6A, the structure of the hRfx1-DBD­DNA complex has been aligned with that of the P4-OBD subunit depicted in orange in Fig. 5, and the protein part of the hRfx1-DBD structure has been removed. The DNA structure (in blue) fits remarkably well within the P4-OBD structure. Residues of the P4-OBD subunit that are in the vicinity of the DNA [see Fig. 4A (P4-OBD1) for their position in the sequence, and Fig. 6B for their position in the structure] include three contiguous residues in the b2 strand (Lys-746) and in the b2­b3 loop (Arg-747 and His748). This region locates in the major groove of the DNA. Contacts with helix a3 are few and involve residues in the N-terminus of that helix (Lys-727). Overall, the b2 strand, the b2­b3 loop and the N-terminal end of helix a3 constitute an extensive DNA-binding interface. This interface will be referred to hereafter as the `primary DNA binding site'. Although the DNA fits well onto the P4-OBD subunit depicted in orange in Fig. 6A, it clashes with strand b2 of the other subunit of the P4-OBD dimer (the subunit depicted in yellow in Fig. 6A). However, the clashes are not severe and can be alleviated easily by rotating the DNA by about 5 around the centre of mass of the DNA. Many of the contacts that the second monomer (in yellow in Fig. 6B) then makes with the DNA involve the residues mentioned above as participating in the putative `primary DNA binding site': residues in the b2 strand and the b2­b3 loop such as Lys-746, Arg-747 and His-748 locate within interacting distance from the DNA, as does Lys-727 in helix a3. However, additional contacts are also observed, which include residues in the C-terminus of helix a3 (Lys738 for example) and the loop connecting helix a3 to strand b2 (Asn-743 for example). Those constitute a `secondary DNA-binding surface' that may play a role in DNA binding by the second subunit of the P4-OBD dimer. The mode of binding of the DNA to the second subunit of the P4-OBD would, however, be atypical for a winged helix protein, as the b2 strand and b2­b3 loop would contact the minor groove of the DNA, whereas the a3 helix residues [one (Lys-738) at its C-terminus and the other (Lys-727) at its N-terminus] would straddle over the minor groove making favourable electrostatic interactions with the phosphate backbone of each strand. A remarkable feature of the proposed binding mode is

that the primary DNA binding sites of both P4-OBD subunits are involved in binding, even though each binding site engages the DNA in a very different manner. In the first P4-OBD subunit (in orange in Fig. 6B), the b2 strand and b2­b3 wing occupy the major groove, whereas in the second subunit, the same side-chains project into the minor groove of the DNA. This is possible because, as illustrated in Fig. 6C for Arg-747, the side-chains in that region can adopt very different conformations and be redirected towards the DNA to maximize interactions. A model for regulation of gpa function by Cnr We show here that Cnr binding disrupts the gpa dimer because its binding site on gpa overlaps with the dimer interface of the P4 DNA-binding domain. Other evidence indicates that heterodimerization of gpa with Cnr results in a complex that binds DNA tighter than the gpa homodimer (Ziegelin et al., 1997b). Yet, Cnr has no detectable DNAbinding activity (Ziegelin et al., 1997b). This body of results is reminiscent of that accumulated on the E2F interaction with DP. E2F proteins, which are transcription factors that regulate the eukaryotic cell cycle, contain an ª 70-residue domain responsible for DNA binding (Helin, 1998; Zheng et al., 1999). E2F proteins form heterodimers with members of the DP family, which are distantly related to the E2F family (Helin et al., 1993). E2F proteins can form homodimers, but heterodimerization with DPs enhances their DNA-binding activity (Bandara et al., 1993; Helin et al., 1993). Although the isolated DNA-binding domain of E2F1 (one of the six human E2Fs that have been isolated to date) binds DNA weakly, the corresponding region of DP1 (one of two recognized DP proteins in humans) has no detectable DNA-binding activity (Krek et al., 1993; Jordan et al., 1994). However, mixing the two DNA-binding domains greatly enhances DNA binding (Bandara et al., 1993; Fraenkel, 1998). Both E2F and DP are winged helix proteins, and heterodimerization involves the a1 and a3 helices in both proteins (Zheng et al., 1999). Hence, the winged helix structure can be used for a1- and a3- mediated heterodimerization, and heterodimerization can lead to enhanced DNA binding. By analogy, the binding properties of the E2F and DP proteins either alone or in a heterocomplex greatly resemble those of P4-OBD and Cnr respectively. Therefore, the question that immediately springs to mind is: could Cnr also be a winged helix protein? To explore this possibility, we aligned the sequence of Rfx1 and Cnr. Although submitting the Cnr sequence to a BLAST search (Altschul et al., 1997) did not return any hit, the alignment of the Rfx1 and Cnr sequences using CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994) demonstrated a striking degree of sequence similarities (Fig. 7). Rfx1-DBD contains 76 residues, 17 of which (i.e. 21%) have their strict corresponding homo-

864 H.-J. Yeo et al. logues in Cnr, and 24 (i.e. 32%) are conserved in Cnr. Such a high degree of sequence homology probably reflects an underlying structural similarity. Consistent with such a conclusion is the observation that non-conserved regions in the alignment of Fig. 7 locate in loop regions. Interestingly, many of the functional residues involved in DNA binding in Rfx1-DBD have their counterparts in Cnr (Arg-19, Arg-48 and Arg-62 for example). The sequence of Cnr was threaded onto the structure of Rfx1-DBD using the alignment presented in Fig. 7 (program MODELLER; Sali et al., 1990), and the resulting structure was assessed using the program 3D-PROFILE (Bowie et al., 1991). Very high scores for a modelled structure were obtained (Z-score of 16 against a Z-score of 26 for Rfx1DBD), indicating that the resulting model is reasonably packed and is probably correct. Hence, heterodimerization such as that used by the winged helix proteins E2F or DP may be used by other winged helix pairs such as Cnr and gpa to regulate their biological function. Conclusions The structure of the gpa DNA-binding domain sheds light on the process of regulation of DNA-binding activity of both replication initiators and transcription factors. Indeed, it has been shown in studies of both transcription and replication that homo- and heterodimerization of proteins play important roles in the regulation of these fundamental biological processes. By either self-associating or associating with other partners in a dimer, the DNAbinding affinity of these proteins can be modulated. In at least one example, the E2F and DP heterodimer, the winged helix motif serves as a scaffold for the regulation of DNA-binding activity through either E2F homodimerization leading to weak binding affinity or E2F-DP heterodimerization leading to tighter interactions with the DNA. Here, we suggest that the use of the winged helix motif for the regulation of protein­protein interaction in DNA-binding proteins may be more general and used by phages and plasmids to regulate the level of replication. Further confirmation of this will require the determination of the structure of the Cnr-P4­OBD binary complex. However, the striking sequence homology between Rfx1DBD and Cnr and between Cnr and P4-OBD (result not shown) strongly suggests structural similarity. The structure of P4-OBD unambiguously demonstrates that parts of or the whole binding site for Cnr locates at the gpa dimer interface. It therefore illuminates the role of Cnr as a regulator of gpa dimerization. Interestingly, the Cnr-gpa heterodimer has increased affinity for the origin DNA. How this may happen is again suggested by the strong possibility that Cnr may have structural homology with Rfx1-DBD. Indeed, many residues that are used in DNA binding in Rfx1-DBD have their equivalent in Cnr, and these could perhaps be used more efficiently for DNA binding than those emanating from the second gpa subunit in the gpa homodimer. A ternary complex of P4OBD with Cnr and DNA would help to answer such a question. Finally, it is still unclear how binding of DNA to P4-OBD can lead to simultaneous binding of both ori1 and crr or local destabilization of the double-stranded DNA at ori1 (Ziegelin and Lanka, 1995; Briani et al., 2001). Interestingly, when the twofold symmetry axis of the P4-OBD dimer is applied to the DNA in Fig. 6B, it appears that the P4-OBD dimer can accommodate two DNAs comfortably (result not shown). Then, it may be possible for iterons at both ori1 and crr or within ori1 to bind simultaneously to the P4-OBD dimer, leading to local destabilization of the DNA.

Experimental procedures Bacterial strains, plasmids, phages, media and DNA techniques
Escherichia coli SCS1 was used to maintain plasmids and to overproduce proteins. Media used were as described previously (Ziegelin et al., 1997a). Standard molecular cloning techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (1989).

Construction of 5¢ and 3¢ truncations of the a gene
To create gpaD1.51th and gpaD1.6th (Fig. 2), the 498 bp AflII­BamHI fragment of gpaD1th was replaced by a 421 bp AflII­HindIII fragment and a 355 bp AflII­HindIII fragment, respectively, generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using gpaD4.3 as the template and a HindIII­BamHI adapter. `th' denotes the thioredoxin gene trxA containing six consecutive His codons. This gene is fused to the 5¢ end of the respective a gene fragments (Ziegelin et al., 1997b). To create gpaD4.9th, gpaD4.10th, gpaD4.11th, gpaD4.114th and gpaD4.12th (Fig. 2), the 528 bp AflII­HindIII fragment of gpaD4.3th was replaced by fragments of 453 bp, 423 bp, 393 bp, 381 bp and 363 bp, respectively, generated by PCR using gpaD4.3 as the template. To generate gpaD4.10, the 493 bp NdeI­NdeI fragment of gpaD4.10th was removed. To generate gpaD4.101, the 1395 bp fragment of pMS470D8 (defined by Balzer et al., 1992) was replaced by a 401 bp NdeI­HindIII fragment generated by PCR using gpaD4.3 as the template. All amplified a genes were sequenced and found to be identical to the nucleotide sequence published (EMBL/GenBank accession number X51522) (Halling et al., 1990).

Fragment retention assay
DNA fragments containing ori1 were incubated with gpa for 30 min at 37C in a total volume of 20 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mg ml­1 bovine serum albumin (BSA) and electrophoresed on non© 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 43, 855­867

Regulation of DNA-binding activity by homo- and heterodimerization 865
denaturing 3.5% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (Ziegelin et al., 1993). The DNA bands were stained with ethidium bromide, visualized and documented using the FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics) and analysed with the IMAGEQUANT software version 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics). Ori1 fragments were complexed specifically by a-proteins, forming large aggregates that do not enter polyacrylamide or agarose gels (Ziegelin et al., 1993). The source for P4 ori1 fragments was pSTP4ori containing the 361 bp ori1 fragment inserted into the multiple cloning site. Digestion with EcoRI, HindIII and MluI yielded the ori1-containing fragment of 412 bp and additional fragments of 732 bp and 3184 bp. The 732 bp and 3184 bp fragments served as competitor DNA.

`origin-binding domain' or P4-OBD) was purified further using a Hitrap heparin column, concentrated to 12 mg ml­1 and stored at 4C.

Crystallization
Native crystals were grown at room temperature by vapour diffusion in hanging drops against a reservoir solution containing 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5­5.0) and 1.5­1.7 M ammonium sulphate (McPherson, 1990). Hexagonal crystals formed in a few days and typically grew to 0.2 mm ¥ 0.2 mm ¥ 0.5 mm in size. Selenomethionine-containing crystals were obtained by streak seeding of native crystals, followed by multicycles of macroseeding. After cryoprotecting progressively (25 min total) to a final solution containing 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.8), 1.8 M ammonium sulphate and 25% glycerol, the crystals were flash frozen under a liquid nitrogen stream.

Partial purification of gpa-th proteins
Gpath proteins were partially purified as outlined by Ziegelin et al. (1997a). As the proteins are poorly soluble, they were solubilized in buffer containing 6 M urea and loaded onto a column of Ni-NTA. After elution in 6 M urea and renaturation by dialysis against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM EDTA and 10% (w/v) glycerol, the proteins were treated further as described previously (Ziegelin et al., 1997a).

Data collection, structure determination and refinement
A multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data set was collected to a resolution of 2.95 Å at beamline 19ID of the Structural Biology Center in the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (Table 1). Crystals belonged to the trigonal space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 82.5 Å, c = 232.8 Å and three P4-OBD dimers per asymmetric unit. All diffraction images were processed, scaled and integrated using the program HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). P4-OBD contains five methionines and, therefore, 30 selenium sites were expected in the asymmetric unit. All the expected selenium sites were located using the program SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). Experimental phases to 3.0 Å were calculated using the program SOLVE and subsequently improved using solvent flattening as implemented in the program DM (CCP4, 1994), yielding an electron density map of excellent quality (Fig. 3A). A partial poly-Ala chain was built using the program O and a database of protein structures (Jones and Thirup, 1986; Jones et al., 1991). The side-chains could also be placed unambiguously into density. The resulting atomic model was refined against 2.95 Å data using conjugate gradient minimization (program CNS; Brünger et al., 1998). NCS restraints were applied to the main-chain atoms of the P4-OBD molecules, and B-factors were refined individually. The NCS restraints applied to the main-chain atoms were such that the root-mean-square deviation between main-chain atoms in the final model was 0.009 Å. Average B-factors were 43 Å2 and 53 Å2 for main-chain and side-chain atoms respectively. The model contains 100 residues from Asp-671 to Lys-770. After bulk solvent correction, refinement converged to a final R-factor of 23.7% and a free R-factor of 28.4% (30­2.95 Å data) (Brünger, 1992). All f, j angles lie in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968). Co-ordinates have been deposited (entry code 1KA8).

Purification of the gpaD4.10 N-His protein and limited proteolysis
The gpaD4.10 N-His construct (gpa 664­777), which is soluble and retains DNA-binding activity, was purified for initial crystallization using standard procedures. After sonication in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 350 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 2 mM DTT, 0.2 mg ml­1 lysozyme, 12% sucrose and 7.5% glycerol, cell lysates were centrifuged at 15 000 r.p.m. for 20 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 at 60% saturation on ice. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in 20 ml (per 1 l culture) of buffer A (20 mM ris-HCl, pH 8, and 0.25 M NaCl) and dialysed against 2 l of buffer A overnight. The dialysed protein sample was applied to a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A and eluted with buffer A containing 1 M imidazole. Pooled fractions were dialysed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 0.2 M NaCl. The dialysed protein sample was applied to a 5 ml Hitrap heparin (Pharmacia) column equilibrated in buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 M NaCl) and eluted using a 60 ml linear gradient of 0.1­0.6 M NaCl in buffer B. Highly pure protein fractions eluted at 0.28 M NaCl. For selenomethionyl proteins, the plasmid was expressed in the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain DL41 in the presence of selenomethionine, using the same procedure for purification (LeMaster and Richards, 1985; Hendrickson et al., 1990).

Preparative protease digestions were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA at 35C for 30 min using trypsin (Boehringer). The ratio of protein to trypsin, optimized after analytical proteolysis, was about 500:1, resulting in a stable C-terminal domain (residues 671­777). This fragment (referred to as the
