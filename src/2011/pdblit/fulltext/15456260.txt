Our exploratory study was based on the concept that a non-amidine factor Xa (fXa) inhibitor is suitable for an orally available anticoagulant. We synthesized and evaluated a series of N-(6chloronaphthalen-2-yl)sulfonylpiperazine derivatives incorporating various fused-bicyclic rings containing an aliphatic amine expected to be S4 binding element. Among this series, 5-methyl4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine type 61 displayed orally potent anti-fXa activity and evident prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) with the moderate bioavailability in rats. The X-ray crystal analysis afforded an obvious binding mode that 5-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine and 6-chloronaphthalene respectively bound to S4 and S1 subsites. In this X-ray study, we discovered a novel intramolecular S-O close contact. Ab initio energy calculations of model compounds deduced that conformers with the most close S-O proximity were most stable. The Mulliken population analysis proposed that this energy profile was caused by both of electrostatic S-O affinity and N-O repulsion. The results of these calculations and X-ray analysis suggested a possibility that the restricted conformation effected the affinity to S4 subsite of fXa.
Introduction Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin have been prescribed for the treatment of thromboembolism, which is a major cause of such ischemic diseases as cardiac infarction, cerebral infarction, deep vein thrombosis, and unstable angina. The acceptance of these conventional drugs, however, does not seem to be satisfactory because of the following reasons. As for heparin, it is not suitable for long-term treatment of these diseases because of low compliance of its parenteral administration and side effects such as bleeding tendency.1 Although warfarin is administered orally and is used for long-term treatment, the drug requires several days of administration to obtain anticoagulant activity and also requires frequent monitoring to maintain that activity at appropriate levels.2 Thus, needs exist for a novel oral anticoagulant with faster onset of action and lower risk of bleeding. Among several approaches to address the unmet needs, the inhibition of factor Xa (fXa) is known as one of the most popular.3 This is mainly because fXa inhibitors seemed to have a lower risk of bleeding than heparin and warfarin. The reason would be attributed to the inhibition position in the coagulation cascade. As is well-known, fXa catalyzes thrombin production and is situated at the confluence of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Thus, fXa inhibitors do not block

thrombin directly; rather, they block the confluent position of the coagulation cascade. A number of fXa inhibitors have been synthesized up to the present.4 Such fXa inhibitors can be classified into amidine derivatives exemplified by DX-9065a5 and nonamidine derivatives. Most of the amidine-type inhibitors were found to be insufficiently absorbed when administered orally, because of strongly basic amidine groups (pKa of benzamidine ) 11.6)4b,6a,k which adopt ionic foams. Therefore, the trend in synthetic studies of fXa inhibitors seems to be shifted to non-amidine type inhibitors containing weakly basic groups such as aminoisoquinoline, imidazole, pyridine, and aniline.6 Especially, a series of N-(6-chloronaphthalen-2-yl)sulfonylpiperazine derivatives 1 and 27 (Figure 1) have interesting structural aspects in terms of their binding mode to fXa, because 6-chloronaphthalene is predicted to replace an amidino benzene or naphthalene as a preferred binding element to the S1 subsite of fXa. Zhu and Scarborough, in their modeling study, proposed that the 6-chloronaphthalene ring of 2 inserted in S1 whereas the pyridine moiety located in S4, and the piperazine ring, func-

tioned as a spacer.4b Aventis's group reported that the 6-chlorobenzo[b]thiophene ring, regarded as the steric isostere of 6-chloronaphthalene, actually occupied the S1 subsite of fXa in crystal complex.8 In their report, the chloro group on the benzothiophene ring occupied a small cavity composed of Tyr 228 and Val 213 in the S1 subsite. We took note of the utility of 6-chloronaphthalene as the S1 binding element, assumed that the piperazine ring functioned as an appropriate linker between the S1 and S4 binding elements, and furthermore expected a possibility to acquire the novel orally available fXa inhibitor on exploring S4 binding element. We were prompted to introduce the fused-bicyclic ring which contains an aliphatic amine as the S4 binding element to the N-(6-chloronaphthalen-2-yl)sulfonylpiperazine unit. We thought the structural aspects of S4 matched the fused-bicyclic ring, because S4, named the "aryl binding site", composed of the residue Tyr 99, Phe 174, and Trp 215 forms a box-shaped site and has a hydrophobic nature. Figure 2 shows the designed compounds containing various fused-bicyclic rings. The calculated pKa values9 of secondary (R ) H) and tertiary amines (R ) Me) in the designed compounds were respectively 6.93-9.23 and 5.53-7.98 whereas that of benzamidine was 12.01. We expected that this weakly basic group also did not cause such poor absorption as the amidine group. In fact, some compounds which contain only one amino group were reported to show good bioavailability in various animals.10 In addition, the tertiary amine substituted with such as the N-alkyl group is further less basic than the secondary in aqueous solution because of the solvent effect of water molecules,11 so that this amine is possible not to be protonated and exist in a molecular form which is suitable for oral absorption. Furthermore, the N-substituent on the tertiary amine is expected to insert into the cavity in the terminus of S4, named the "cation hole", to increase the affinity to S4. In this paper, we report on our discovery of a nonamidine fXa inhibitor having a fused-bicyclic ring as the novel S4 binding element, and our investigation into the binding mode of this derivative by X-ray crystallography and ab initio calculations.

Preparation of lithium 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4,5,6,7tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-2-carboxylate (33) is shown in Scheme 6. Reaction of 3-chloro-1-ethoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone (30)16 with thioformamide gave 5-ethoxycarbonyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine (31). After removal of the ethoxycarbonyl group of 31 by alkali hydrolysis, the resulting 4,5,6,7-tetrahy-

drothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine was protected with di-tertbutyl dicarbonate then treated with n-BuLi and CO2 to give 33. 5-Boc-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid and 6-Boc-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno- [2,3-c]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid were prepared with the method reported by Katano et al.17 Preparation of 1-(6-chloronaphthalen-2-yl)sulfonylpiperazine (36) is shown in Scheme 7. (6-Chloronaphthalen2-yl)sulfonyl chloride (35) was synthesized via -sulfonylation and successive chlorination of 2-chloronaphthalene (34). Compound 35 was treated with tert-butyl 1-piperazinecarboxylate, and the resulting compound was deprotected to give 36. N-(6-Chloronaphthalen-2-yl)sulfonylpiperazine derivatives 36 and 37 were condensed with various carboxylic acids to give the corresponding compounds (Scheme 8). 4-(6-Chloronaphthalen-2-yl)sulfonyl-2-ethoxycarbonylpiperazine (37) was prepared with the method reported by Nishida et al.18 Ethoxycarbonyl derivative 58 was hydrolyzed under alkali conditions, and then the resulting carboxylic acid was condensed with ammonia to give carbamoyl 59. Deprotection of Boc derivatives 38, 41, 44, 48, 52, 55, and 59 gave the corresponding 39, 42, 45, 49, 53, 56, and 60, and then alkylation by reductive methylation with formaldehyde gave the corresponding 40, 43, 46, 50, 54, 57, and 61. Alkylation of 60 with EtI gave 62. The reductive alkylation with acetone gave isopropyl 63. Results and Discussion At first, we investigated anti-fXa activities of compounds having various hetero aromatic rings involving a secondary or tertiary amine. The in vitro anti-fXa activities are summarized in Table 1. Tetrahydroisoquinoline 39, 40, tetrahydronaphthylidine 42, 43, tetrahydropyrrolopyridine 45, 46, and tetrahydrofuropyridine derivative 47 only exhibited weak activities. On the other hand, tetrahydrothienopyridine 49, 50, 53, 54, and tetrahydrothiazolopyridine 56 and 57, which contain the S atom in their heterocycles, had a tendency to show more potent activity than those derivatives without the S atom. Tertiary amino derivatives 50, 54, and 57 resulted in 1.5- to 3-fold more activity relative to the corresponding secondary derivatives 49, 53, and 56. However, 5-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[4,5c]pyridine 51 showed 5-fold less activity than 57. These results suggested that both of the S and N atoms in the heterocyclic ring, and the appropriate position of the tertiary amino group were required for potent anti-fXa activity for a 5-6 fused-system. Second, we executed optimizations of tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine 57 as a lead compound. For the purpose of elevating potency, we noted the amino moiety of tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine or the piperazine ring. Because it is thought that the introduction of various alkyl groups on the amino moiety is the ap-

proach to acquisition of the most suitable substituent fitting to "cation hole" in S4. The other reason is that the introduction of the polar group on the piperidine ring regarded as a linker is expected to yield the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the amino acids such as Gly 216 or Gly 219. There are some reports that the moiety linking S1 and S4 binding elements has the ability to form hydrogen bonds with Gly 216 or Gly 219 of fXa in modelings or crystal structures.8b,19 We expected this ability from the carbamoyl group. According to the expectations described above, we designed and synthesized the carbamoyl derivatives 60-63 which are substituted, respectively, methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl on the amino moiety. In Table 2, the in vitro anti-fXa, anti-thrombin, and anticoagulant activities are summarized. Although the introductions of carbamoyl groups did not increase anti-fXa activity, N-methyl 61 was superior in anticoagulant activity as PTCT2 in human plasma and selectivity over thrombin to the corresponding 57. All compounds tended to exhibit more potent anticoagulant activities in human plasma than these

in rat plasma. N-Ethyl 62 and N-isopropyl 63 showed 4- to 5-fold less activity than 61. This result indicated that the N-methyl group was a suitable alkyl substituent on the amino moiety. With respect to compounds 57 and 61, which showed potent activity in vitro, we executed preliminary ex vivo tests for measuring of anti-fXa activity with oral administration of 30 mg/kg to rats. Whereas compound 57 only displayed 27.6 ( 3.3% inhibition at 1h after oral administration (n ) 3), compound 61 did 69.0 ( 2.1% inhibition at same time point. As the anticoagulant activity (PTCT2) of 61 in human plasma is more than 3-fold potent relative to that in rat plasma as shown in Table 2, we expected that the orally evident anticoagulant activity in rats would indicate a possibility of the useful antithrombotic agent. In the time course ex vivo test with oral administration of 30 mg/kg to rats (n ) 4), compound 61 displayed almost equipotent anti-fXa activity of 67.4 ( 1.5% to the preliminary, showed evident anti-fXa activity until 6 h after administration, and also showed our expected anticoagulant activity,

namely, evident prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) of 1.13-fold at 1 h (Table 3). Figure 3 shows the serum concentration of compound 61 administered intravenously (5 mg/kg iv) or orally (5 mg/kg po). The changes of anti-fXa activity ex vivo and the orally serum concentration on time course were correlative. In the oral administration at 5 mg/kg dosing, CL, Vdss, Cmax, and T1/2 of 61 were respectively 55.95 mL/min/kg, 10.59 L/kg, 0.35 µg/mL, and 1.6 h. The AUCiv or po and bioavailability, were respectively 4.20 µg,h/mL (5 mg/ kg iv), 1.49 µg,h/mL (5 mg/kg po) and 35%.

Conformational Analysis with X-ray and ab Initio Calculation Study. To determine the binding mode of 61, we executed an X-ray study of 61 and Glaless fXa,8b,19b,20 which has been used because of the ease of growing crystals. The statistics of data processing and crystallographic refinement for the resulting crystal of 61 and Gla-less fXa are shown in Table 4. The result of the crystal structure confirmed the validity of our prediction. Whereas the 6-Cl group of the naphthalene ring occupied a small cavity composed of Tyr 228, Val 213, and Ala 190 in the S1 subsite in agreement with the result of 6-chlorobenzo[b]thiophene,8b the 5-methyl4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyridine located in the S4 subsite lay parallel to the indole ring of Trp215 (Figures 4, 5). This X-ray structure provided further detailed observations for the binding mode of the 5-methy-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine ring to the S4 subsite. One was that the 5-methyl group on tetrahydrothiazolopyridine faced forward toward the "cation hole" in the S4 subsite and occupied the space at the entrance of this hole as shown in Figure 5. We thought that the affinity of the 5-methyl group for this space was caused not by ionic interactions but by van der Waals contacts or a hydrophobic effect, because the tertiary amino moiety containing the 5-methyl group was not protonated and no interactions were confirmed between this amino moiety and the carboxylate of Glu 97. From this observation and the SAR study of Table 2, we assumed that the sizes of the N-methyl group on the tetrahydrothiazolopyridine were most suitable for the substituent that fit the space by the "cation hole". The other observation was that an intramolecular S-O contact was recognized in the 2-carbamoylthiazole moiety. The computer-generated drawings for 61 picked out from the structure of the crystal complex were shown in Figures 6 and 7. The distance of S1-O7 was 2.86 Å shorter than the sum of the corresponding van der Waals radii (3.25 Å). The 2-(N,N-dialkylcarbamoyl)thiazole moiety was found to adopt a plane conformation, since the torsion angle of S1-C1-C2-O7 was 2.15 °. Several heterocyclic drugs having intramolecular S-O contacts have been reported. Goldstein's group21 reported extensive studies for this contact in heterocyclic nucleoside analogues containing a thiazole or a thiophene ring. Nagao et al.22,23 reported the investigations for various types of S-O close contacts in heterocyclic drugs and their properties. Tanaka et al.24 and Collins et al.25 respectively, reported similar observations in penem antibiotics and GABAA receptor agonists. Our result of X-ray analysis is the first report to confirm a novel intramolecular S-O contact in a complexed crystal structure of inhibitor and Gla-less fXa. In all of the reports for the S-O close contacts, the common suggestion was that this close contact restricted the conformation of a compound to effect on its biological activity. This suggestion invoked a prediction that the similar effect increased the affinity of the 5-methyl4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine ring to the S4 subsite. By using computational studies, Burling et al. proposed that the electrostatic environments consisting of the affinity between the positively charged S atom and the negative O atom, and the repulsion between the negative N atom and the same O atom, restricted the

rotation of the glycosyl bond in the thiazole nucleoside.21a,f As shown in Figure 8, we also predicted that both this affinity and the repulsion synergistically influenced the restriction of the C-C bond rotation in the 2-carbamoylthiazole moiety. The SAR in Table 1 for thieno and thiazolo types supported this hypothesis. Namely, both the S-O affinity and N-O repulsion restrict the bond rotation to strongly fix the direction of the N-methyl group so that there was a big difference of activity between [4,5-c]thiazolo 51 and [5,4-c]thiazolo 57, because it is possible that the N-methyl group of 4,5-c 51 faces and hits the wall of S4 while that of 5,4-c 57 faces the "cation hole". On the other hand, in thieno types 50 or 54, we thought only the S-O affinity restricted the C-C bond rotation so that there was a small difference of activity between 3,2-c 50 and 2,3-c 54. To disclose conformational and electrostatic characteristics lurking in the 2-carbamoylthiazole or thiophene moieties, we performed ab initio MO calculations using the GAMESS program26 for the model compounds I and II illustrated in Figure 9.

At first, we examined each relative energy (HF) for the various conformers of I and II in which torsion angles ( ) of the S-C-CdO moiety changed from 0° to 180°. The value of each HF of I and II was respectively calculated values on the basis of the energy (0 kcal/mol) of conformer I-A (X ) N, ) 0°) and II-A (X ) CH, ) 0°) shown in Figure 9. HF of conformers I-A and II-A with the closest S-O proximity exhibited the minimum value among the respective various conformers. Furthermore, the stability of I-A was more remarkable than that of II-A. These results suggested that the S-O proximity was related to the stability of conformers and that the N atom on the thiazole ring amplified the stability. It is notable that the torsion angle (2.15°) in the X-ray analysis for compound 61 and Gla-less fXa was almost consistent with that of the conformer I-A. To trace the difference of conformational characters between model compounds I and II, we examined each electron distribution of heteroatoms by Mulliken population analysis.27 We thought that this examination could compare electrostatic environments for I with II. The illustrations of Figure 10 show geometries ( ) 0° or 180°) with respective charges of heteroatoms. Whereas Mulliken charges of S atom (S1) in I and II were positively charged for both conformers, those of the O atom (O7) in I and II were negative. In addition, the N atom (N3) on the thiazole ring in I was negatively charged. Although respective N atoms (N8) on the carbamoyl group in I and II were negatively charged,

S-O were calculated as 3.00 and 3.01 Å which were shorter than the van der Waals radii. As for other conformers, charges of the respective heteroatoms had almost the same tendency (data not shown). The results of energy and charge calculations led to the suggestion that both the electrostatic S-O affinity and N-O repulsion were synergistically related to the restriction of the C-C bond rotation in I. Conclusion We have synthesized and evaluated a series of N-(6chloronaphthalen-2-yl)sulfonylpiperazine derivatives to discover a non-amidine fXa inhibitor having a fusedbicyclic ring as the novel S4 binding element. SAR study for anti-fXa activity of this series indicated that both of the S and N atoms in the heterocyclic ring and the appropriate position of the tertiary amino group were required for potent anti-fXa activity for a 5-6 fusedsystem, so that it was found that 5-methyl-4,5,6,7tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridine was the most preferred S4 binding element. Furthermore, compound 61 showed orally potent anti-fXa activity and evident prolongation of PT with moderate bioavailability. The X-ray crystal study with Gla-less fXa afforded an obvious binding mode of 61 of which thiazolopyridine and 6-chloronaphthalene respectively bound S4 and S1 subsites. In this X-ray study, we discovered a novel intramolecular S-O close contact in the crystal complex. From ab initio MO calculations of model compounds, it was suggested that the restriction of C-C bond rotation was caused by both the electrostatic S-O affinity and N-O repulsion in the 2-carbamoylthiazole moiety to fix the direction of N-methyl group required for potent antifXa activity. Experimental Section
Preparation of the Crystal. Purified human Gla-less fXa was purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. Without further purification, the purchased protein sample was dialyzed against 5 mM maleate imidazole, pH 5.0/4 mM CaCl2/ 10 mM benzamidine, and concentrated to 7.5 mg/mL with microcon-10 (Millipore Co.). Concentrated Gla-less fXa was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (15% PEG6000/1 mM CaCl2/0.3 M AcONa/0.1 M maleate imidazole, pH 5.0) and vapor-equilibrated against the same solution at 20 °C. Under this condition, the crystal did not form spontaneously, so micro- and macroseeding methods were needed to obtain crystals of appropriate size. The resultant benzamidine/ Gla-less fXa crystal was exposed to a two-step soaking method described below to obtain complex crystals with compound 61.
