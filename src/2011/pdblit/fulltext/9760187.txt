(Received 21 April/16 June 1998)

The mature hen avidin encoded by a synthetic cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli in an insoluble form. After resolubilization, renaturation and purification, a recovery of about 20 mg/l cell culture was obtained. ELISA assays indicated no apparent differences in biotin binding between the natural and recombinant avidins. In addition, an acidic avidin mutant, bearing the substitutions Lys3Glu, Lys9 Glu, Arg26Asp and Arg124Leu of four exposed basic residues, was produced. The protein, expressed and renatured as wild-type avidin, showed unaltered biotin-binding activity. The acidic pI ( 5.5) and lack of aggregation of the mutant allowed easy electrophoretic analysis under non-denaturing conditions of the protein alone and of its complexes with biotin, biotinylated transferrin or peroxidase. Analysis of the sera from sensitized subjects revealed that the avidin mutant has altered antigenicity. Both recombinant avidins were crystallized and the three-dimensional structures solved by molecular replacement and refined to 0.22 nm resolution. The three-dimensional structures of the two recombinant molecules, in the absence of biotin and of glycosylation, are fully comparable with those of the natural hen avidin previously reported. Keywords : avidin; crystal structure ; mutagenesis ; recombinant protein.

Avidin, a minor constituent of egg white of reptiles, amphibia and birds, is a glycosylated and positively charged protein which can bind up to four molecules of vitamin H, D-biotin [1]. The interaction with biotin is non-covalent but extremely tight, the dissociation constant of about 1 fM being about 10 3 106 times higher than that of a typical antigen-antibody interaction. The cDNA-derived and protein-derived sequences [2, 3] and the crystallographic structures of avidin [4 6] are known. Functional avidin is a tetramer of identical subunits and each subunit is folded into an eight-stranded anti-parallel -barrel displaying up-and-down topology. The biotin-binding site is located in the core of the barrel, and is built by residues of the barrel itself and partly by a loop of an adjacent subunit. The interest in avidin derives mainly from several applications based on its rapid and almost irreversible binding to biotin and to practically any biotin-based molecular construct [7, 8]. Avidin is used in vivo for the targeting of solid tumors [9] in applications where proteinsurface properties are determinants for proper biodistribution, serum clearance and immunological response [10]. The production of recombinant avidin and its mutated forms could increase the already remarkable versatility of this protein and may improve its properties for in vivo use.

Avidin has been expressed in Escherichia coli where it is accumulated in inclusion bodies, with only a minor proportion of soluble and functional protein [3, 11]. Correctly assembled and functional recombinant avidin has been obtained from transfected mammalian cell lines [12] and, more recently, in a baculovirus expression system [13]. Mutated avidins, however, have not been described so far. We report here methods for renaturing recombinant avidin produced in E. coli. The procedure yields about 20 mg pure protein/l cell culture. Moreover, we describe the engineering of an avidin variant bearing the four Lys3Glu, Lys9Glu, Arg26Asp and Arg124Leu amino acid substitutions at solvent-exposed sites. The mutant [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin displays biotin-binding activity fully comparable with that of natural avidin. Moreover, it proves useful for electrophoretic characterization of avidin complexes with biotin or biotinylated proteins under native conditions and displays distinct antigenic properties. Finally, we analyze the three-dimensional structures of both recombinant apo-avidins produced, by X-ray crystallography, showing that they are essentially coincident with those of the natural, glycosylated hen egg-white protein. MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA cloning and expression. The gene coding for avidin was constructed by assembling eight synthetic oligonucleotides of 89 105 bp (Primm) designed on the protein sequence reported in [2]. This synthetic gene, flanked by NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, was subcloned into a pET11b vector digested with NdeI

454

and BamHI. The resulting plasmid (pET11b-Avi) codes for a protein with an N-terminal Met followed by the Ala1 Glu128 avidin sequence. To produce the acidic mutant [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin, a new 88-bp NdeI EcoRI fragment coding for amino acids 1 27 was synthesized to include the substitutions Lys3Glu, Lys9Glu and Arg26Asp. The adjacent fragment EcoRI BamHI (306 bp) was amplified by PCR using primers of 30 nucleotides, one of which carried the codon for Leu instead of Arg124. The two fragments (NdeI EcoRI and EcoRI BamHI) were subcloned into a pET11b vector digested with NdeI and BamHI and the sequence confirmed by direct sequencing. To express the recombinant proteins, the transformed E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were grown in Luria-Bertani medium in a 7-l fermenter, at 37°C until A600 nm reached 0.8, then 0.4 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added and, after 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 g for 15 min, at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 % (mass/vol.) sodium azide and sonicated with three cycles (1 min each) in an ice bath. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Electrophoresis and Western-blotting analysis. Denaturing SDS/PAGE was performed in 15% polyacrylamide gels, after heating the samples at 95°C in 1% SDS, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and native PAGE was performed in 7.5 % polyacrylamide gels [14]. Non-denaturing cathodic electrophoresis was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels in 0.375 M sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 8.3 % (by vol.) glycerol ; the running buffer was 0.35 M alanine, 0.14 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Samples were diluted with equal volumes of 0.125 M sodium acetate, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue or electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose paper and probed with rabbit anti-avidin (ICN) and goat anti-(rabbit IgG)-horseradishperoxidase-conjugated antibodies (Sigma). Peroxidase activity was detected using the 4-chloro-1-naphthol chromogen. Dot-blot experiments were performed by dotting 1 µl biotinylated transferrin at different concentrations onto nitrocellulose paper, and probing with different mixtures of the avidin mutant and biotinylated horse radish peroxidase (HRP). Enzyme activity was revealed with electrochemiluminescence (Amersham Italia) following the instruction of the manufacturer. Protein purification. The insoluble fractions of cell homogenates were resuspended in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 M urea, 50 U/ml Benzonase (Merck), 2 mM MgCl2 and incubated for 18 h at 37°C. After centrifugation and washing with 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 % Triton X-100, the pellets were dissolved in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 1.5, with 8 M guanidine/HCl (Gdn/HCl), 3 mM dithiothreitol, then dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 1.5, containing 6 M Gdn/HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol at room temperature. The clarified samples were diluted to a final protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ ml in the same buffer, then dialyzed at 4°C against renaturation buffer [0.2 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.7, 1 mM reduced glutathione (GSH) and 0.5 mM oxidised glutathione (GSSG)]. The soluble samples were then loaded onto a 2-iminobiotin agarose column equilibrated with 50 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.8, 0.5 M NaCl, and eluted with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.5 M NaCl. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and stored as described above. Protein biotinylation. Biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Calbiochem) was used to modify primary amines exposed on the protein surface. 1 ml protein (0.5 mg/ml in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.5) was mixed with 0.1 ml biotinylating reagent (4 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) and incubated for 4 h at room temperature under shaking. The sample was then dialyzed against

0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.5, or gel filtered on a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia). Protein characterization. Molecular-mass determination. Analytical gel-filtration chromatography was performed on an FPLC (Pharmacia) Superose 12 column, in 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.4, calibrated with catalase, aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen, and ribonuclease A. Purified proteins were subjected to electron spray mass spectroscopy analysis using a VG BIO-Q triple quadruple mass spectrometer (VG Biotech). Samples of 2 10 µl were directly injected into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 2 µl/min. The instrument was calibrated with myoglobin. All mass values are reported as average masses. ELISA assays. The proteins were analyzed for biotin binding in a competition ELISA assay. Microtiter plates were coated with 10 µg/ml natural avidin for 120 min at 37°C in 50 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.6. After washing with 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (NaCl/Pi), 0.05% Tween-20, the plates were incubated with biotinylated peroxidase (3 ng/ml) in the presence of increasing concentration of avidin for 60 min at 37°C. Enzyme activity was revealed using o-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride. Immunological analysis. The antigenicity of natural, recombinant and mutant avidins was studied by measuring their immunoreactivity with the sera of patients treated during three-step tumor targeting with radioactive labeled biotin [9]. Microtiter plates were coated with 10 µg/ml natural recombinant, and mutant avidin in NaCl/Pi for 18 h at 4°C. The plates were washed with NaCl/Pi and blocked with 3% BSA in NaCl/Pi for 1 h at 37°C. After washing with NaCl/Pi , the plates were incubated with serum samples diluted 1:100 in NaCl/Pi, 0 05% Tween-20 (NaCl/Pi-T), containing 0.5 % BSA, for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed again with NaCl/Pi-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-human-HRP-labeled antibody (Sigma) diluted 1 :2000 in NaCl/P i-T-BSA. Crystal growth. Both forms of recombinant avidin were crystallized by vapor-diffusion techniques, at 22°C, using solutions at 15 mg/ml protein concentration. In the case of recombinant avidin, the precipitating agent was poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8000, 9% mass/vol., in 0.05 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, whereas the mutated avidin was crystallized from 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.05 M sodium phosphate, pH 5.7. Prismatic crystals of about 0.4 0.15 0.15 mm3 could be grown in both cases in one week. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku R-axis IIc detector, coupled to a RU200HB rotating anode generator, for both recombinant avidin forms. Data reduction and analysis was performed using MOSFLM and programs from the CCP4 suite (CCP4, 1994) (Table 2). Both recombinant avidins yielded isomorphous crystals (orthorhombic space group P21212, a 7.57 nm, b 8.08 nm, c 4.36 nm for recombinant avidin, and a 7.66 nm, b 8.21 nm, c 4.38 nm for [E3,E9, D26,L124]avidin, respectively). These crystals are strongly reminiscent of the partly deglycosylated avidin crystal form reported in [4], although not exactly isomorphous. Structure solution of recombinant avidin was achieved through molecular-replacement techniques, using the atomic coordinates of hen egg-white apo-avidin dimer as search model [6, 15]. Both the rotational search (run in the 0.8 0.3 nm resolution range; final correlation coefficient 29.1) as well as the transrational search (run in the 0.75 0.4-nm resolution range; final correlation coefficient 67.7) provided unambiguous solutions (final R factor 0.385). After rigid body refinement of the two asymmetric-unit-independent avidin chains, using routines from the TNT package [16] the R factor was 0.355, at 0.3-nm resolution. The model was subsequently refined to 0.22 nm resolution following standard restrained refinement procedures, with continuous in-

The crystal structure of [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin has been refined to 0.22 nm resolution following identical procedures, after proper initial rigid body refinement of the recombinant avidin model to allow for the slightly modified unit cell edges. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for both recombinant avidin and [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein, from which copies are available (data sets 1rav, 1cam) [18].

RESULTS Expression and purification of recombinant avidin. SDS/ PAGE of E. coli transfected with pET11b-avi showed that avidin accounted for a large fraction ( 20%) of the total bacterial proteins in the insoluble fraction of the cellular homogenate (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Avidin identity was confirmed by immunoblotting with a specific antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 4). To renature the insoluble protein, a modification of the procedure described for streptavidin [19] was used. It consisted of: (a) washing of the insoluble fraction of the homogenates with 2 M urea, 0,1 % Triton X-100 and treatment with 50 U/ml benzonase to remove contaminating nucleic acids (at this stage the avidin fraction was

enriched to about 60% of the total insoluble protein); (b) denaturation and resolubilization of the sample in 8 M Gdn/HCl, pH 1.5, 3 mM dithiothreitol, followed by dialysis against 6 M Gdn/HCl, pH 1.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, to remove small contaminants, and dilution to a final protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ ml; (c) renaturation by exhaustive dialysis against 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.7, 1 mM GSH, 0.5 nM GSSG, at 4 °C; (d) purification of the clarified sample by affinity chromatography on agarose-iminobiotin columns. A major loss of avidin occurred at the renaturation step, where about 40% of avidin remained in the insoluble fraction, and at the iminobiotin affinity-chromatography step which retained only about 30% of the solubilized avidin. An ELISA assay revealed that about 35% of the solubilized avidin after the renaturation step was active in biotin binding and quantitatively recovered by iminobiotin affinity chromatography (Table 1). The avidin fraction not retained by the iminobiotin column contained a major component which was recognized in immunoblotting by anti-avidin Ig and had the same mobility in SDS/PAGE and the same molecular mass (14 344 Da, by electron spray mass spectroscopy analysis) as the purified and active avidin (14 341 Da) indicating the presence of misfolded intermediates. The renaturation/purification protocol yielded about 20 mg functional recombinant avidin from 1 l cell culture (Fig. 1 B, Table 1) with an electrophoretic purity higher than 95%. The same procedure was applied to the expression and purification of [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin, obtaining similar recovery and purity (not shown). The purified and active proteins were subjected to electron spray mass spectroscopy analysis (Fig. 2). Avidin was resolved into a component of 14 340 Da, which is about 4 Da lighter than the predicted peptide (14 344.1 Da) without the N-terminal methionine, and a second minor component of 14 383 Da, i.e. 43 Da heavier that the major component. The mutant was resolved into three components, one with mass 14 260 Da, close to the expected (14 261.9 Da) and the others 34 Da and 64 Da heavier, respectively. These results are consistent with partial oxidation of the two methionine residues occurring during renaturation. The purified avidins eluted from gel-filtration Superose 12 columns in single symmetrical peaks of apparently 62 kDa (not shown). On cathodic gel electrophoresis, the recombinant avidin migrated faster than the natural one, probably due to the lack of glycosylation (Fig. 1 C). To compare the relative affinities for biotin, an assay was set up in which the sample avidins competed with a solid-phase avidin to bind limiting amounts of tracer biotin. The competition curves of the two recombinant

proteins (Fig. 3) were very similar and slightly shifted compared to that of the natural protein. Electrophoretical analysis of avidin-biotin complexes. Electrophoretic analysis under non-denaturing conditions resolved [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin into two close bands with mobilities similar to that of bovine serum albumin, a protein with an acidic pI and comparable size (67 kDa compared to 57 kDa of avidin ; Fig. 4, lanes 1, 2). Recombinant and natural avidins cannot be analyzed under these conditions, due to their strong basicity, while streptavidin is poorly resolved into a diffused slow moving streak (Fig. 4, lane 4). Incubation with an excess of soluble biotin increased the electrophoretic mobility of the mutant avidin, and the apo and holo molecules could be easily separated (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 3); in contrast, the treatment did not affect streptavidin mobility (lanes 4, 5). Next, the complexes with biotinylated proteins were studied. Incubation with increasing amounts of biotinylated transferrin (a protein model chosen for its simple electrophoretic pattern) yielded three discrete bands and a major proportion of large components which did not enter the gel (Fig. 5A, lanes, 1 8). Interestingly, at the equivalent point, i.e. in the absence of free avidin, only high molecular-size complexes were detectable. Parallel analysis on non-denaturing

SDS/PAGE indicated that the three discrete bands in the range 100 160 kDa are compatible with dimers or trimers, while the high molecular-mass complexes were above 1000 kDa (not shown). A similar approach was used to analyze biotinyl-HRP/ avidin complexes. Analysis of mixtures with constant amounts of biotinyl-HRP and increasing amounts of [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin (Fig. 5 B, top) revealed at least three types of complexes, indicated as I, II and III. Since HRP has a slow mobility (Fig. 5 B, lane 1), and the proportion of the fast-moving complexes increased in parallel with increasing concentrations of [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 8), it was deduced that complexes I, II and III probably contain 1, 2 and 3 molecules of avidin, respectively. The mixtures were then diluted to stain biotinylated transferrin in dot-blot experiments; the background signal decreased with increasing avidin concentrations and the specific signal reached a maximum at lanes 4 and 5, then decreased (Fig. 5B, bottom).

Below the lanes, dots with the indicated amounts of biotinylated-transferrin are shown, which were stained with samples of the corresponding lanes, diluted 1:67, and developed with electrochemiluminescence.

Antigenic properties of the recombinant and mutant avidins. The natural, recombinant and [E3,E9,D26,L124] avidins were reacted in an ELISA assay with sera of sensitized subjects with a high titer of anti-avidin Ig (Fig. 6). Natural and recombinant avidins produced the same response with all 15 sera, while [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin was underestimated by 11 sera, particularly by the four (5, 9, 11, 15) with the highest titer. Similar results were obtained in a system in which the avidins were immobilized by reaction with absorbed biotinylated bovine serum albumin (not shown). Crystallographic structure of the recombinant avidins. In accordance with previous results [4, 6], the asymmetric unit of

crystalline recombinant avidin contains two protein chains (half of the functional tetramer). The final refined models of recombinant and [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin contain 1952 and 1940 protein atoms, respectively ; the final R factors, calculated in the 2.02 0.22-nm resolution for recombinant avidin, and in 2.2 0.22-nm resolution range for [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin, are 0.170 and 0.179, respectively (see Table 2). Both models display ideal

In this stereo-view, the CA backbones of the recombinant apo-protein (thick bonds) have been overlayed to those of natural apo-avidin (110 CA pairs, excluding the 3 4 loop region Ala36 Ile44, residues Ala1 Arg2 and Leu124 Thr125, rmsd 0.049 nm). Moreover, the side chains of the mutated residues Lys3Glu, Lys9Glu, Arg26Asp, Arg124Leu have been displayed.

stereochemical parameters, as evaluated by the program PROCHECK [20]. The overall conformation of recombinant avidins is in strict agreement with that observed for the natural protein, whose individual subunits fold in an antiparallel, eight-stranded -barrel (up-and-down topology), defining the biotin-binding site [4 6]. Both recombinant and [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin structures display a disordered polypeptide segment in the so called 3 4 loop, between residues Ala36 and Ile44, which is not observed in the electron-density maps. Such flexibility has been related to the absence of biotin, which is sealed in its binding site by the lid action of the 3 4 loop, once bound to avidin [4, 5]. Weak electron density is observed for the Asp86 Arg88 segment, whereas essentially no density is present for the N-terminal Ala1 Arg2 and the C-terminal Arg(Leu)124 Thr125 residues, in both recombinant and [E3,E9,D26,L124] avidins. The rmsd calculated between the CA backbones of the two protein subunits in the crystallographic asymmetry unit are 23 pm and 25 pm for recombinant and [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin, respectively. The rmsd of the CA backbones for recombinant avidin with respect to natural avidin is 51 pm, close to the rmsd value calculated for [E3,E9,D26,L124] compared to that of natural avidin, which is 49 pm (Fig. 7A). All rmsd values are calculated over 110 CA pairs, i.e. one full subunit omitting the disor-

dered 3 4 loop region (Ala36 Ile44), residues Ala1 Arg2 and Arg(Leu)124 Thr125. Inspection of the avidin structure at the mutation sites Lys3Glu, Lys9Glu, Arg26Asp, Arg124Leu shows that inversion of the electrostatic charges at these exposed sites has no significant effect on the detailed protein structure. The mutated residues Glu3 and Glu9 display only partial side-chain electron density, whereas residue Asp26 is completely defined. Moreover, the N-terminal residues Ala1 Arg2 are completely disordered as well as the C-terminal residues Arg124 Thr125, thus including the fourth mutated (Arg124Leu) amino acid. Structural comparisons of the biotin-binding site of both recombinant avidins with that of the natural apo-avidin show a strict conservation of the biotin recognition (polar and apolar) residues in their productive orientations for biotin binding (Fig. 7 B). As previously reported for the natural apo-avidin, such a structural arrangement is achieved through conservation of all the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and contacts which define the conformation of biotin-binding-site residues. The biotin-binding site of both recombinant avidins reported here shows electron density compatible with a water molecule located at the dead end of the pocket, hydrogen bonded to residues Ser16, Tyr33 and to Asn118. The same site is occupied in holo-avidin by the ureido ring carbonyl oxygen of biotin. Additional electron

DISCUSSION The insoluble recombinant avidin expressed by E. coli can be renatured with yields of about 20 mg/l cell culture obtaining a protein suitable for biotechnological applications and biochemical characterization. The recovery of the functional avidin was much lower (20 %) than that reported for streptavidin (70%) [19], although expression effciencies and renaturation procedures were very similar for the two proteins. Avidin renaturation had to be performed under more restricted conditions (e.g. at 4 °C and at a concentration below 1.5 mg/ml) and produced a relevant proportion of soluble, non-functional and misfolded molecules, not described for streptavidin. The same occurred for [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin indicating that difficulties in avidin refolding, as compared to streptavidin, are not related to its strong basicity. We showed that recombinant avidin has structural and functional properties analogous to those of the natural protein, including the conservation of its antigenic properties. The only molecular properties which characterize recombinant avidin with respect to natural avidin consists in a slightly faster electrophoretic mobility in cathodic PAGE (Fig. 1 C), compatible with the lack of glycosylation, and in the presence of components about 30 40 Da heavier than predicted from the encoded amino acid sequence, revealed by electron spray mass spectroscopy analysis. These components are present also in the [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin mutant and probably arise from partial oxidation of the two methionine residues caused by the renaturation procedure. Similar modifications have been observed in other recombinant proteins renatured in vitro [21]; however, we have no evidence that they may affect avidin functionality or structure. Recombinant avidin has also been recently obtained in a baculovirus expression system, obtaining a glycosylated protein with properties analogous to those of natural avidin, including the high thermo-resistance [13]. Similarly, both recombinant and [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin saturated with biotin resisted heating at 80°C in the presence of 1% SDS (not shown), indicating that glycosylation does not contribute to avidin physical stability. We designed a mutant with the aim to abolish the characteristic basicity of wild-type avidin without modifying its structural/functional and crystallization properties. To this aim, four basic exposed residues, not involved in crystal contacts, were substituted with acidic groups. Nevertheless, due to a coding error, one of the selected residues (Arg124) was substituted with a neutral Leu instead of an acidic Asp. The encoded mutations, however, were sufficient to modify the protein pI from 10 to 5.5 (as detected by isoelectric focusing) changing drastically the electrophoretic mobility. Under native conditions, the molecule is resolved into two sharp bands. This is a distinctive property of [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin, as compared to the wild-type avidin which is too basic to be analyzed under these conditions, and to streptavidin which is poorly resolved, due to the formation of aggregates. Such a property can be exploited to analyze avidin complexes under native conditions. In fact, due to the acidic component of the ligand, biotin binding increases the electrophoretic mobility of [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin. In this respect, the easy separation of apo and holo forms of the molecule allowed us to detect free biotin traces in biotinylated protein preparations with a simple and rapid procedure. The number and types of molecular adducts formed by the interaction of avidin with polybiotinylated proteins are unpre-

dictable and diffcult to analyze. The [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin provides fast electrophoretic analysis of such adducts under native conditions, as shown by the two examples with biotinylated monomeric proteins. The complexes of avidin with biotinyltransferrin were predominantly of high molecular size, larger than 1000 kDa (Fig. 5 A), with dimeric or trimeric complexes being poorly populated at all the avidin/transferrin ratios. In contrast, the avidin/biotinyl-HRP adducts were of smaller size and appeared to contain one HRP molecule bound to 1 3 avidins. The reasons of these differences are not related to the biotinylation procedure adopted, which was the same for the two different proteins. The analysis of 15 sera of subjects displaying a high titer of anti-avidin Ig showed strongly reduced recognition of [E3,E9, D26,L124]avidin in 11 subjects, indicating that the substituted residues are involved in the antigenic structure of epitopes. This finding may suggest a novel method to circumvent the anti-avidin response in patients exposed to avidin, a major drawback which inhibits the repeated in vivo use of avidin in immunotherapy [9, 10]. Before treatment, patient sera may be analysed for reactivity to a panel of avidin mutants with modified antigenicity, such as [E3,E9,D26,L124]avidin, to identify those, not being recognised by the circulating antibodies, which are likely to reach the target tissue and be effective. Conservation of the well known tertiary and quaternary structures in natural and recombinant avidin is in keeping with the maintained biotin-binding activity displayed by the recombinant protein, and with its electrophoretic and immunological properties. Moreover, possibly related to the substantial thermal stability of the protein and to the robust nature of the antiparallel -barrel topology, it is remarkable that the overall structural properties of the protein are not affected by its refolding in E. coli, by different crystal growth conditions and crystalline lattice contacts, and by the glycosylation state of the protein [4 6]. These considerations are reflected, at the atomic level, by the strong conservation of the conformation of the biotin-binding site, which in apo-avidin structures has always been found strictly complementary in shape and (a)polarity to the biotin molecule. Indeed, such structural properties of avidin are in keeping with the high biotin association rate and with its exceptional affinity for the protein [22]. The low pI avidin mutant has been designed paying attention to avoid modification of the crystal contacts in orthorhombic avidin. The results reported here show that such an approach can be successful, in that it provides an active protein with the desired pI, and can lead to crystallization conditions which differ substantially from those of natural and recombinant avidins, while yielding isomorphous crystals.
