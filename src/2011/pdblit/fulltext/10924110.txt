ABSTRACT: The structure of cytochrome f includes an internal chain of five water molecules and six hydrogen-bonding side chains, which are conserved throughout the phylogenetic range of photosynthetic organisms from higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. The in vivo electron transfer capability of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cytochrome f was impaired in site-directed mutants of the conserved Asn and Gln residues that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules of the internal chain [Ponamarev, M. V., and Cramer, W. A. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 17199-17208]. The 251-residue extrinsic functional domain of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f was expressed in Escherichia coli without the 35 C-terminal residues of the intact cytochrome that contain the membrane anchor. Crystal structures were determined for the wild type and three "water chain" mutants (N168F, Q158L, and N153Q) having impaired photosynthetic and electron transfer function. The mutant cytochromes were produced, folded, and assembled heme at levels identical to that of the wild type in the E. coli expression system. N168F, which had a non-photosynthetic phenotype and was thus most affected by mutational substitution, also had the greatest structural perturbation with two water molecules (W4 and W5) displaced from the internal chain. Q158L, the photosynthetic mutant with the largest impairment of in vivo electron transfer, had a more weakly bound water at one position (W1). N153Q, a less impaired photosynthetic mutant, had an internal water chain with positions and hydrogen bonds identical to those of the wild type. The structure data imply that the waters of the internal chain, in addition to the surrounding protein, have a significant role in cytochrome f function.

Cytochrome b6f is the electron/proton transfer protein complex of oxygenic photosynthesis that functions between photosystems II and I. Electrons from photosystem II (PS II) are transferred through the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome f in the high-potential chain of the cytochrome b6f complex to plastocyanin and photosystem I (PS I). The b6f complex also contributes to the transmembrane potential via translocation of two protons across the photosynthetic membrane for each electron transferred through the complex. Many aspects and details of the proton translocation pathway are not understood. Cytochrome f, the largest subunit of the b6f complex, consists of an N-terminal 251-residue redox-active domain in the lumen-side aqueous phase, and a 35-residue C-terminal transmembrane anchor in the photosynthetic membrane of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The heme in this c-type cyto This work was supported by USDA Grant 98-35306-6405 to J.L.S. and W.A.C. and by NIH Grant GM-38323 to W.A.C.

chrome is covalently bound to the protein through thioether bonds to Cys21 and Cys24. The spectral and redox properties of the heme, which is 45 Å from the transmembrane anchor, are identical in the soluble fragment and in the fulllength protein. The three-dimensional structure of cytochrome f is unique among c-type cytochromes (1). The soluble fragment consists of two -domains, the larger of which includes the hemebinding peptide, residues 1-25. The heme Fe is coordinated by the side chain of His25 and the R-amino group of Tyr1. The structure includes a rare buried chain of five water molecules inside the heme-binding large domain (2). These structural features are conserved throughout the biological range of cytochrome f (3). Structures have been reported for cytochrome f from turnip (1), from the cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum (3), and in preliminary form from the alga C. reinhardtii (PDB entry 1cfm; 4). The function of the buried water chain is unknown. However, residues surrounding the heme and the internal water chain are the most conserved in cytochrome f, suggestive of a critical function (3). Essentially all residues that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules of the internal buried chain are invariant among at least 27 cytochrome f sequences (Figure 1). Only two exceptions to invariance have been reported among residues whose side chains contribute hydrogen bonds to the internal water chain. In the sequence from bean Vicia faba (5), Thr (codon ACC) is reported at position 153 instead of Asn (possible codon

Mutations in the Cytochrome f Water Chain

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 31, 2000 9165 with the soluble form of the cytochrome produced in a heterologous Escherichia coli expression system (10). Here we present crystal structures for the wild type and three "water mutants" of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f. The structures of the N153Q, Q158L, and N168F cytochromes were determined in an effort to probe the function of the internal water chain, and to ask whether the loss of phototrophy in N168F and the inhibition of cytochrome f function and shift of redox potential in Q158L and N153Q are a consequence of perturbation of the water chain. We find that changes to the structure of the water chain itself are associated with the most severe impairment of cytochrome function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of Wild-Type Cytochrome f and Plastocyanin from C. reinhardtii Via Photoautotrophic Growth. Plasmid pADI283ST (11), provided by F. A. Wollman and R. Kuras, was used to transform the petA deletion strain of C. reinhardtii (12), from R. Malkin and J. Zhou. Cell lines expressing soluble cytochrome f were identified and propagated. Purification of soluble cytochrome f and plastocyanin from C. reinhardtii was carried out as described previously (10, 13). Photoautotrophic growth was carried out at 25-28 °C. Heterologous Expression and Purification of Cytochrome f Mutants. Mutations N153Q and Q158L were generated and recloned into the pUCPF2 construct as previously described (10). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR1)-based protocol was used to generate the N168F mutation in plasmid pUCPF2 (14). The pUCPF2 constructs were cotransformed into E. coli strain MV1190 (Bio-Rad) with plasmid pEC86 (Cmr), which carries the cassette of cytochrome c maturation genes ccmA-H and was kindly provided by L. Thony-Meyer (15). ¨ Transformants were isolated on plates containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol and cultured for expression. E. coli cells used for cytochrome f expression were harvested from 28 L of culture and osmotically shocked. The yield in the soluble fraction was 1-1.4 mg/L for the wild type and the mutant cytochromes, as determined from the chemical difference spectrum, using a differential extinction coefficient  554 of 26 mM-1 cm-1 (16). The pink soluble extract was concentrated and dialyzed against 1 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and loaded on a DEAE52 Sephacel column. Bound cytochrome f was eluted with 100 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT. Combined cytochrome f fractions were concentrated to 10 mL and passed through a G-100 column, with 10 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5). Fractions with an A554/A280 ratio of >0.3 were collected, concentrated, and applied to a hydroxyapatite column. Bound cytochrome f was washed with 3 volumes of 10 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT and eluted with 100-150 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5). Fractions with an A554/ A280 ratio of >0.9 were combined, concentrated, and stored at -70 °C. The yield of purified cytochrome f was 20 mg. All protein samples were >95% pure, as judged by SDSPAGE. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection. Purified cytochrome f was crystallized at 20 °C by vapor diffusion

AAC). In the sequence from the marine diatom alga Odontella sinensis (6), Ile (codon ATT) is reported at position 168 instead of Asn (possible codon AAT). Large clusters of buried water molecules are rare in proteins (7), and are generally associated with a specific function. For example, buried waters have been implicated in the proton transfer pathway of bacteriorhodopsin (8) and in the "D channel" for proton uptake in cytochrome oxidase (9). The conservation of the internal water chain (3) in the proton-pumping b6f complex implies a role for proton conduction in the exit port of this pump. The pronounced effect on the rate of cytochrome f reduction for mutations of conserved residues that contribute side chains to the water chain was interpreted in terms of proton-coupled electron transfer (10). However, it has not been possible to obtain isolated coupled membranes on which the effects of these mutations on the proton pump could be tested directly. Therefore, the assignment of the function of the water chain is still unclear. The function of the water chain in cytochrome f was studied in variants in which the water chain was systematically perturbed by mutagenesis. Mutants N153Q, Q158N, Q158L, N168Q, N168F, and N233L were generated in C. reinhardtii and the functional consequences characterized (10). The most impaired mutant was N168F, which was designed to disrupt the internal water chain and, in fact, could not grow phototrophically. The other mutants grew phototrophically, but did not function as well as the wild type. The major effect in vivo was a pronounced decrease in the rate of cytochrome f reduction, greatest in Q158L. The changes in the rate of reduction in vivo in the N153Q and Q158L mutants were also accompanied by a decrease in midpoint potential of 30 and 80 mV, respectively, determined

The wild-type cytochrome f solution included 88 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT, and the reservoir was 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 25-50 mM calcium acetate, and 12-18% (w/v) PEG 8000 (Fluka). Small rod crystals (200 µm × 80 µm × 50 µm) were harvested into 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 25 mM calcium acetate, and 15% PEG 8000 and cryoprotected in 20 min by transfer through harvesting solutions with successively higher concentrations of glycerol in increments of 4% to a final concentration of 20%. The N153Q cytochrome f solution included 80 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT, and the reservoir was 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 25 mM calcium acetate, 1 mM DTT, and 17-19% PEG 8000. Crystals were grown for 4 days at 12 °C and then at 20 °C. Rectangular plate crystals (240 µm × 200 µm × 80 µm) were harvested into 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 25 mM calcium acetate, and 18% PEG 8000 and cryoprotected by transfer through harvesting solutions with successively higher concentrations of glycerol in increments of 6% to a final concentration of 25%. The Q158L cytochrome f solution included 10 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and traces of DTT, and the reservoir was 100 mM MES (pH 6.7), 50 mM ammonium fluoride, 5% glycerol, and 1921% PEG 3350 (Hampton). A crystal (250 µm × 100 µm × 80 µm) was cryoprotected by harvesting into 100 mM MES (pH 6.7), 50 mM ammonium fluoride, 15% glycerol, and 21% PEG 3350 for 15 s. The N168F cytochrome f solution included 10 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT, and the reservoir was 100 mM MES (pH 6.7), 200 mM ammonium formate, 14% glycerol, and 17% PEG 3350. A crystal (280 µm × 200 µm × 80 µm) was harvested into 100 mM MES (pH 6.7), 200 mM ammonium formate, 14% glycerol, and 21% PEG 3350 and cryoprotected in 10 min by transfer through harvesting solutions with 15, 18, 21, and 25% glycerol. X-ray diffraction data for the wild-type cytochrome were recorded with CuKR radiation using a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode source and a Rigaku R-Axis IV image plate detector (Molecular Structures Corp.) in a single 100° sweep of 1° oscillation images. Data for the N153Q mutant

cytochrome were recorded using the wiggler source at BioCARS beam line ID14-B at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) on a Quantum 4 2 × 2 mosaic CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.) in a single 233° sweep of 1° oscillation images. Data for the Q158L mutant cytochrome were recorded using the bending-magnet source at BioCARS beam line BM14-C at the APS on a Quantum 4 CCD detector in a 118° high-resolution sweep of 0.5° oscillation images at 60 s exposure and an 85° low-resolution sweep of 1.5° oscillation images at 10 s exposure. Data for the N168F mutant cytochrome were recorded using the undulator source at SBC beam line ID19 at the APS on a 3 × 3 mosaic CCD detector (17) in 180° sweeps of 1° oscillation images of 10 s at high resolution and 2° oscillation images of 2 s at low resolution. Data were processed with the HKL package (18, 19) and are summarized in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement. The structure of wild-type C. reinhardtii cytochrome f was determined by molecular replacement from a truncated model of the 70% identical turnip cytochrome f (PDB entry 1hcz; 2) using the program AMoRe (20, 21). After positioning of the three cytochrome f molecules in the asymmetric unit and rigidbody refinement in AMoRe using 20-4.0 Å data, the truncated model had a correlation coefficient of 0.59 and an R-factor of 0.41. The truncated model was completed to reflect the sequence of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f. All manual model building and inspection were carried out with the program O (22). The complete model was refined in stages using the program CNS (23): rigid-body refinement of large and small domains, grouped B-factor refinement (two thermal parameters per residue, for side chain and main chain atoms), simulated annealing, and several rounds of positional and individual atomic B-factor refinement alternating with manual model building. Waters were identified using the automatic procedure in the CNS program, which is based on peak picking in |Fo| - |Fc| maps and iterative acceptance and/or rejection by geometric criteria. The ordered solvent structure for all refined models was verified by inspection. The refinement protocol for the mutant cytochrome f structures was similar to that used for the wild type, without the simulated annealing step. At each site of mutation, side chain atoms beyond C were deleted from the starting model. All ordered solvent molecules, including the five internal

waters, were also deleted. In each case, electron densities for the mutant side chain and for the internal waters were clear in the first |Fo| - |Fc| map. Crystals of N153Q and wild-type cytochrome f were nearly isomorphous, and the wild type was used as a starting model. Several residues were modeled in dual conformations: Leu51, Ile130, and Val141 in chain A, Ile19 and Ile130 in chain B, and Ser142, Val159, and Ile215 in chain C. The last iteration of refinement was followed by one round of atomic occupancy refinement for residues in dual positions. Three strong electron density peaks were interpreted as acetate ions from the crystallization solution. Crystals of Q158L cytochrome f were also nearly isomorphous with those of the wild type and the N153Q cytochrome. The 1.9 Å structure of N153Q cytochrome f was used as a starting model for refinement of the Q158L mutant structure. No residues in dual positions were visible in the lower-resolution maps of Q158L cytochrome f, and fewer water molecules were identified. Atomic B-factors from the N153Q starting model were retained, but adjustments were made only through the grouped B-factor refinement procedure in CNS. In the last round of refinement, individual atomic B-factors were refined for Leu158. Crystals of N168F cytochrome f were not isomorphous with the others, and the structure was determined by molecular replacement from the 1.9 Å structure of N153Q cytochrome f using the program AMoRe. After positioning of the two cytochrome f molecules in the asymmetric unit and rigidbody refinement in AMoRe using 15-3.5 Å data, the correlation coefficient was 0.44 and the R-factor was 0.41 for a model that was complete except for the side chain at position 168. In the final model, dual positions were modeled for Leu19, Val39, Leu75, Ile93, Val141, and Val159 in chain A and for Cys21 and Glu79 in chain B. The last iteration of

refinement was followed by one round of atomic occupancy refinement for residues in dual positions. The refined models are summarized in Table 2. Structure Comparisons. Structure comparisons were carried out as for plant and cyanobacterial cytochrome f (3). CR atoms in the large domain of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f (residues 1-169 and 231-249) were superimposed using routines in the program O and the program LsqKab in the CCP4 suite (24). All structure comparisons were based on superpositions that in no instance included the buried water chain. For the multiple copies of cytochrome f in each crystal structure, analogous water positions in the buried water chains were identical within experimental error following the large-domain CR superposition, except where otherwise noted. Therefore, an average water position at each of the buried sites was used in the analysis. Spectroscopy and Determination of Cytochrome f Midpoint Potential. Spectroscopic measurements were taken using a Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). The precision ((0.1 nm) of the wavelength calibration was checked using the 486.0 and 656.1 nm emission lines of an internal deuterium lamp. Midpoint oxidation-reduction potentials for the wild type and mutant forms of cytochrome f were determined by titration with ferri- and ferrocyanide at pH 7.0 in 50 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer while monitoring the redox potential and the absorbance at 554 nm. The initial potential (ca. 500 mV) was set by addition of 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide and the titration carried out by subsequent addition of aliquots of sodium ascorbate to decrease the potential in 15-20 mV decrements. The potential at each point of the titration was measured with a digital multimeter (Fluke 73 Series II). The electrochemical cell consisted of a Pt wire with an Ag/AgCl electrode (MF

The titration was fit to a one-electron Nernst equation. Stopped-Flow Kinetics of Cytochrome f Oxidation by Plastocyanin. The kinetics of cytochrome f oxidation by plastocyanin in solution were studied using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics SX.18MV), in 2 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.2 M NaCl. The concentration of cytochrome f, which was purified from the E. coli expression system, was 0.1 µM in the 200 µL reaction mixture, and that of plastocyanin was 10, 15, and 20 times greater for realization of pseudo-first-order kinetics for the oxidation. The rate of cytochrome oxidation was monitored as the rate of decrease in absorbance at the corresponding peaks of the Soret band of the reduced cytochrome. The pseudo-first-order kinetic data were fit with a single exponential to obtain the first-order rate constant, kobs (s-1). The resulting kobs values were plotted against plastocyanin concentration to obtain the bimolecular rate constant, k2 (M-1 s-1). RESULTS Structures of Wild-Type and Mutant C. reinhardtii Cytochrome f. The crystal structures of wild-type and mutant C. reinhardtii cytochrome f offer a total of 11 views of the protein in five different crystal environments. Crystals of the wild-type, N153Q, and Q158L cytochromes were nearly isomorphous, each with three molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The N168F variant produced a

different crystal form with two independent molecules. The quality of the four structures is correlated with the diffraction limits of the crystals, as is evident in the average temperature factors, the number of ordered water molecules per polypeptide, and the estimated coordinate errors (Table 2). The best diffraction data were obtained for the N168F cytochrome by collimating the undulator X-ray beam to irradiate only one well-formed end of the crystal. The Q158L variant was recalcitrant to crystallization and produced more weakly diffracting crystals than the other variants. Crystals of all variants except N168F exhibited anisotropic diffraction; anisotropy was most severe for the wild-type and Q158L crystals. Each structure includes all 251 residues encoded by the construct used for expression. No residues are found in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot apart from the small-domain loop of residues 187-189 and the Cterminus, which are less well ordered than the rest of the molecule in all crystal structures. Residues 249-251, which are connected to the transmembrane domain in the full-length protein, adopt a variety of conformations in the four crystal structures, and are involved in lattice contacts in several instances. For each crystal structure, differences among redundant copies of the protein are nearly at the level of experimental error. These intracrystal differences were used to evaluate differences between wild-type and mutant cytochromes. Comparison of C. reinhardtii, Plant, and Cyanobacterial Cytochromes f. The structure of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f is very similar to structures of the plant and cyanobacterial cytochromes, as expected for proteins with sequences more than 60% identical. CR atoms of the wild-type C. reinhardtii

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 31, 2000 9169 The phototrophic mutants N153Q and Q158N exhibited approximately the same Em as N168F, whereas two other phototrophic mutants, N168Q and Q158L, had larger decreases in Em to values of 314 and 294 mV, respectively (10). Thus, an altered redox potential could not explain the non-phototrophic phenotype resulting from the N168F mutation. The spectral characteristics of the mutant proteins were changed slightly compared to those of the wild type (Table 3). The Q-band (R-band) peaks of the reduced and oxidized spectra of the Q158L and N168F mutants were blue-shifted by 0.3 and 0.6 nm, respectively, with spectral reproducibility of (0.1 nm. The largest spectral shift was in the peak of the N153Q mutant, which was red-shifted by 1 nm and had an additional shoulder at 549 nm. Compared to those of the wild-type protein, the Soret peaks of the reduced forms of the three mutant proteins were virtually unchanged, whereas the spectra of the oxidized forms were blue-shifted by 1.2-3 nm. The phototrophic cytochrome b6f complexes of C. reinhardtii containing the N153Q and Q158L mutant forms of cytochrome f displayed altered kinetic properties in vivo (Table 4). Compared to the wild type, these cells exhibited 4-6-fold slower rates of cytochrome f re-reduction following rapid oxidation induced by a light flash. The slow (milliseconds) formation of a membrane potential (s) in thylakoid membranes, which is attributed to net charge transfer through the cytochrome b6f complex, was also affected by the mutations. The absorbance spectrum of membrane-associated carotenoid molecules undergoes a spectral shift with a change in the membrane potential, which gives rise to the so-called "electrochromic bandshift". The half-times for the rise of the slow electrochromic bandshift were increased by factors of 2 and 3 in mutants N153Q and Q158L, respectively. No electrochromic bandshift was detected for cells containing N168F cytochrome f even when they were grown heterotrophically; there was no phototrophic growth. As noted above, the data for mutant cytochromes also do not indicate a correlation between changes in the Em values and the rates of reduction for the mutant proteins. For example, although Q158L has the largest Em and slowest rate of reduction in vivo, no correlation was observed between the Em and the reductive rate for the three conservative mutants (N168Q, N153Q, and Q158N) and the nonconservative mutant N233L (10). Rate constants for the oxidation of cytochrome f by C. reinhardtii plastocyanin were measured in vitro using purified cytochrome f that was produced in E. coli. The secondorder rate constant was not significantly changed when mutant proteins N153Q (52 × 107 M-1 s-1) and Q158L (73 × 107 M-1 s-1) were used in the reaction as opposed to the wild type (60 × 107 M-1 s-1). A similar rate was also measured with the N168F mutant protein (73 × 107 M-1 s-1). Thus, the non-phototrophic phenotype of the N168F mutant is not a consequence of a large decrease in the rate of electron transfer to plastocyanin, and must be associated with other functions of cytochrome f within the b6f complex. However, it should be noted that the bimolecular rate for the cytochrome f-plastocyanin reaction in vitro, which was measured by stopped-flow spectroscopy, is limited by the association kinetics of cytochrome f and plastocyanin rather than by the rate of interprotein electron transfer.

large domains superimpose with those of the turnip cytochrome (1) with an average rmsd of 0.5 Å, and with those of the cyanobacterial cytochrome (3) with an average rmsd of 0.8 Å (Figure 2A). The small domains of the algal, plant, and cyanobacterial cytochromes are likewise similar (data not shown). A flexible hinge connects the large and small domains of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f (Figure 2B). The hinge angle differs by 3-6° among the three independent molecules of the wild-type cytochrome, and by about the same amount between the wild-type and mutant cytochromes (3-8°). Thus, individual cytochrome variants display no preference for a particular hinge position (Figure 2B). Even greater flexing of the hinge may occur in solution. A flexible hinge was inferred from the 4.5° difference between small domain positions in the cyanobacterial and turnip cytochromes (Figure 2A), but interspecies differences could not be ruled out (3). Spectroscopic and Redox Properties of the Cytochrome f Mutants. The oxidation-reduction midpoint potential (Em) and spectral parameters were measured in E. coli extracts for the N168F non-phototrophic mutant of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f. In Table 3, these values are compared with previously reported values for the wild type and the N153Q and Q158L variants (10). Spectral parameters include the wavelength maxima of the Soret band in the visible spectrum and of the Q-band (R-band) in the difference spectrum of reduced minus oxidized cytochrome f. Rates of cytochrome f oxidation by plastocyanin in solution were measured using purified proteins and are presented in Table 4 along with previously reported in vivo kinetic parameters for the wild type and phototrophic variants (10). A 30-80 mV decrease in Em relative to that of the wild type was observed in the mutant cytochromes, with the Q158L variant exhibiting the largest change. The Em of 342 mV for the non-phototrophic N168F variant was less positive than the wild-type value by only 30 mV (Em ) -30 mV).

Structure Comparisons of Wild-Type and Mutant C. reinhardtii Cytochrome f. All comparisons were based on superposition of the 188 CR atoms in the large domain of each independent cytochrome f from each crystal structure onto molecule A of the N168F cytochrome structure (Table 5). The N168F variant was used as the superposition standard because it produced the highest-quality crystal structure. The similarity of multiple, independent copies of cytochrome f in each of the crystal structures provided a metric against which to evaluate the differences between wild-type and mutant cytochromes. In general, large domains of the wild type and N153Q, Q158L, and N168F variants superimposed as well with each other (0.2-0.6 Å rmsd) as the redundant copies of cytochrome f superimposed within each crystal structure (0.3-0.6 Å rmsd). We used a similar approach to compare the buried water chains in the four cytochrome f crystal structures. Although they were not used to determine the superposition operator, the water molecules of the internal chain superimposed as well as the CR atoms within each crystal structure. Because the discrepancy of internal water positions within each crystal structure was not significantly greater than the estimated error in atomic positions, an average water position at each site in the internal chain was used to compare mutant and wild-type structures. These average positions are depicted in Figure 3, and a quantitative summary is given in Table 6. N153Q. The amide group of Gln153 in N153Q cytochrome f occupies the same site and has the same hydrogen bonding interactions as the Asn153 amide in the wild-type cytochrome (Figures 1 and 3A). The Gln153 side chain is 0.5 Å closer to the heme than Asn153 due to the extra methylene group. This slight perturbation of the heme environment may account for the spectroscopic changes of this mutant. Q158L. The amide side chain of Gln158 in wild-type cytochrome f occupies a polar pocket in the structure and forms hydrogen bonds with three main chain atoms (Leu26 NH, Arg156 O, and Asn168 O) and with W1 of the internal water chain. Leu158 cannot satisfy these hydrogen bonds, and the Leu substitution causes a major local perturbation in the structure (Figures 1 and 3B). The Leu158 side chains have different conformations in the three independent cytochrome molecules and higher temperature factors than the Gln158 side chains in the wild-type structure. Multiple Leu158 conformations are not evident in any of the three independent molecules, but it is unlikely that low-occupancy conformers would be visible in the electron density at 2.5 Å resolution. The Leu158 side chains in two of the cytochrome f molecules (A and C) point toward the internal water chain. There is no density at the W1 position in molecule C, for which Leu158 is nearest the water chain. In molecule A, W1 is displaced nearly 1 Å from its position in all other C. reinhardtii cytochrome f molecules. In molecule B, with the distal Leu158, W1 occupies a position analogous to W1 in

the other variants. We conclude that in solution, Leu substitution at position 158 results in weaker binding of water at the W1 position. N168F. Two of five water molecules were lost from the internal water chain in N168F. The amide side chain of Asn168 in wild-type cytochrome f is hydrogen bonded through N2 to W4 and through O1 to W5 of the internal water chain (Figure 1). The aromatic ring of Phe168 in N168F cytochrome f displaces the two water molecules and occupies the same space as N2, O1, W4, and W5 in the wild-type structure (Figure 3C). Consequently, the Phe side chain has close contacts with polar atoms in the water pocket, including Val60 N, Arg156 O, Pro232 O, and Asn233 O1. Changes in the Internal Water Chain. The largest change in the structure of the internal water chain is the loss of W4 and W5 in the N168F cytochrome. The Phe168 side chain of N168F occupied the positions of W4 and W5 in the wildtype protein. A much smaller change is seen in the Q158L cytochrome, where the occupancy of the water in position W1 is reduced to the point of vanishing from one of three independent molecules and significantly shifted in a second. We quantitated changes in the internal water structure between wild-type and mutant cytochromes, using water positions averaged over the redundant copies in each crystal structure (Table 6). The internal water structure is remarkably well preserved, except sites where waters have been displaced. Overall, changes in water positions between mutant and wild-type structures are smaller than the estimated error in atomic positions. The internal water chain is part of the most well ordered core of the structure for mutants and the wild type alike. The temperature factors for the internal water molecules are lower than the average temperature factor of protein main chain atoms in all cases. DISCUSSION Mutation of side chains that form hydrogen bonds with the internal water chain affects cytochrome f function. All mutations to water chain residues reduced the growth rate of C. reinhardtii, and the N168F replacement resulted in a loss of phototrophism (Table 4). All mutations also altered the Em of the protein, illustrating the fact that the fine atomic arrangement of the water chain region and hydrogen bonding of one of the waters by the heme ligand His25 are important for the precise setting of the Em in the wild-type protein (Table 3). All mutations resulting in a phototrophic phenotype also reduced the rate of cytochrome f reduction in vivo (Table 4). Changes caused by mutagenesis of water chain residues are large relative to changes caused by mutagenesis at other sites in C. reinhardtii cytochrome f. We use as a basis for comparison other mutant forms of C. reinhardtii cytochrome f, in which two to five basic Lys side chains were replaced

with neutral or acidic side chains (12, 13). The Lys replacements eliminated a basic surface patch, which was thought to direct cytochrome f interactions with plastocyanin in vivo. For the replacements of as many as five Lys side chains, C. reinhardtii doubling times increased 10-40%, Em was reduced up to 10 mV, and the in vivo cytochrome f re-reduction half-time was increased 1.3-1.5-fold. By comparison, the single-site water chain replacements had much greater effects on cytochrome f function. C. reinhardtii doubling times increased 40-90% (and N168F was nonphototrophic); Em was reduced 30-80 mV, and the in vivo cytochrome f re-reduction half-time was increased 5-6-fold (ref 10 and this work). Structural Integrity of Water Chain Mutants. The structures of the water chain mutant cytochromes are identical overall to the wild-type structure (Table 5). Perturbations to the structures were confined to the immediate vicinity of each substitution. All three mutants (N153Q, Q158L, and N168F) folded and assembled with heme at the same levels as the wild-type cytochrome in an E. coli expression system. Thus, the impairment of cytochrome function in vivo and the altered properties detected in vitro are not due to instability or gross rearrangements of the protein structure in the mutants. Residue 153 is the only one of the mutagenized residues in contact with the heme. The hydrogen bonding of mutant Gln153 and wild-type Asn153 are identical, but the heme contacts of the longer Gln153 side chain are more numerous than those of Asn153. Small changes in the heme electronic environment may account for the slightly altered properties of N153Q cytochrome f. By far, the largest perturbation to any of the structures was the elimination of two waters (W4 and W5) from the internal five-water chain in the N168F mutant cytochrome. The Q158L substitution resulted in lower occupancy and shifted position for the water nearest residue 158 (W1). Both the N168F and Q158L substitutions resulted in loss of hydrogen bonds and diminished polarity of the water chain environment. Two external water molecules near W5 have been proposed as part of the water chain (4). However, the external waters, like others in the first hydration shell of the protein, are more weakly bound than the internal waters with temperature factors more than twice those of W1-W5. We do not consider these external waters to be part of the water chain. Correlation of in ViVo and in Vitro ObserVations. The greatest effects in vivo were seen for substitutions that altered

9172 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 31, 2000 the structure of the water chain itself. N168F cytochrome f lost two waters from the internal chain and did not grow phototrophically. Among the phototrophic water mutants, Q158L had reduced occupancy and significantly altered position at one water site and was most severely impaired (C. reinhardtii doubling time increased 90%; cytochrome f re-reduction half-time increased 6-fold). We conclude from all the data that the internal five-water chain is important to cytochrome f function, and that perturbation of the water chain impairs function. While there is a clear correlation between changes to the structure of the water chain and in vivo measurements of cytochrome f function, the picture is less clear for measurements that we can make in vitro. The spectral parameters, midpoint potentials, and rates of oxidation by plastocyanin do not correlate with loss of function in vivo or with changes to the internal water structure for the cytochrome f water mutants. It is likely that changes to the internal water structure impair a feature of cytochrome f function that is not accessible to in vitro measurements. The likeliest candidate is the reduction of cytochrome f by the Rieske protein, which has the largest changes among the in vivo assays. The in vivo kinetic measurements were made in a system with a fully reduced electron transfer pathway from PS II through cytochrome b6f to PS I. A flash of light triggered electron transfer from PS I to NADP+, and subsequent electron flow through the entire pathway. Cytochrome f was initially oxidized by plastocyanin and then rereduced by the Rieske protein. In this assay, changes to electron transfer rates through cytochrome f may have been masked by other slower steps in the pathway. Nevertheless, in the water mutants substantial changes were observed in the rate of cytochrome f re-reduction by the Rieske protein. This step has not yet been assayed effectively in vitro. Loss of Phototrophic Growth in N168F. Low levels of N168F holocytochrome f in C. reinhardtii were either a result or cause of the loss of photosynthetic growth in this mutant. The content of wild-type and mutant holocytochrome f was estimated by heme staining of membranes from C. reinhardtii (10). Heme staining of protein in whole-cell extracts from late-log phase cultures of the N168F mutant revealed low levels of assembled cytochrome f. No detectable N168F cytochrome f was reported previously (10), but repeated determinations revealed low levels of 10-20% of the wildtype level (data not shown). These levels are at the threshold for sustaining photosynthetic growth with wild-type cytochrome f (26). Levels of Q158L cytochrome f in C. reinhardtii were 50-60% of the wild-type levels (10). Holocytochrome f was detected at the wild-type level in the N153Q mutant. The low steady state level of assembled cytochrome f in the N168F strain of C. reinhardtii is somewhat puzzling because (i) yields of N168F and wildtype proteins were identical in the E. coli expression system; (ii) the redox and spectroscopic characteristics of N168F differed no more from those of the wild type than did those of the Q158L and N153Q mutants, which were present at much higher levels in C. reinhardtii; and (iii) the b6f complex accumulates to almost wild-type levels in non-phototrophic mutants affecting subunit IV, the petD gene product (27). The low level of N168F cytochrome f in C. reinhardtii may have resulted from a defect not detected in the E. coli expression system. For example, the impaired function due

Sainz et al. to loss of two of the internal waters may have resulted in a higher rate of turnover of nonfunctional cytochrome b6f, and/ or a slower rate of cytochrome f assembly, which could then be subject to proteolytic degradation in vivo. Slow assembly of the b6f complex may also have caused an accumulation of unassembled cytochrome f, which can lead to inhibited translation of petA mRNA encoding cytochrome f (28). Proton Transfer Function (pK) of Em in the Wild Type and Mutants. Proton transfer is an obvious function for the unique elongated buried water chain in cytochrome f. If a portion of this water chain is near the p-side membrane interface of the proton-translocating cytochrome b6f complex, then the water chain may function in the p-side exit port for protons translocated across the membrane by the complex. More specifically, we have suggested that the water chain may function in translocation of the second proton released on the p side of the b6f complex in the oxidation of plastoquinol, PQH2 (29). The occurrence of proton-coupled electron transfer in cytochrome f is consistent with the diminished rate of cytochrome f reduction in mutants affecting residues that form hydrogen bonds with the water chain (10). The Em of cytochrome f is pH-independent from pH 4.5 to 8.0, with an observed pK at approximately pH 8.5. An obvious group in the heme vicinity that may be responsible for this pK is N1 of His25 (2). The heme propionates are not in a hydrophobic environment, and have pKs below pH 5 in the aqueous phase (30). However, the hydroxyl groups of solvent-exposed tyrosine side chains near the heme, such as Tyr1, Tyr9, and Tyr160, could account for the high pK. The pK also could be due to one of the water molecules in the internal chain. Whatever group is responsible for the transition is unlikely to serve in physiological proton translocation at the low ambient pH of the chloroplast lumen, thus presenting a problem for the hypothesis of coupled electron and proton transfer in cytochrome b6f.

Greski for expert preparation of the manuscript. NOTE ADDED IN PROOF While this paper was in press, a C. reinhardtii cytochrome f structure, which we cite in preliminary form (4), was published (31). The P212121 crystal form reported is identical to that of the wild type and the N153Q and Q158L mutant cytochromes reported here. An intermolecular association in the crystal lattice is proposed by Berry and co-workers as a possible dimerization interface for cytochrome f in the dimeric cytochrome b6f complex. While this intermolecular contact buries a large cytochrome surface area, it also buries more than 15 water molecules in our wild-type cytochrome structure and in this respect resembles a crystal lattice contact more than a dimeric subunit interface. However, a similar lattice contact occurs in our structure of the N168F mutant cytochrome, which crystallized under nearly identical conditions in an unrelated (P21) form. The angle between molecules of the interacting pair differs by 8° in the N168F cytochrome (space group P21) and the other C. reinhardtii

Mutations in the Cytochrome f Water Chain cytochrome structures (space group P212121). The intermolecular contact is not a general feature of cytochromes f, as it does not occur for one-third of the molecules in the P212121 crystal form, and does not occur in the structures of either the turnip (1) or the cyanobacterial (3) cytochrome. As pointed out by Berry and co-workers, the heme orientation relative to the membrane plane that is inferred from the proposed dimeric arrangement of cytochrome f is inconsistent with EPR data on cytochrome b6f in oriented membranes.
