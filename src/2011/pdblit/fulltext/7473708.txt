Abstract
The crystal structure of c&is-[(NH,),Pt(l-MeT),(OH)(H,O)]AuCl,.H,O, where l-MeT is the anion of lmethylthymine, CsH7N202, is reported. The compound contains both heterocyclic bases bound to Pt via the N3 positions, the two nucleobase ligands being in a head-to-head orientation. It represents the first X-ray structurally characterized example of a Pt(IV) species of thymine. The compound crystallizes in the space group Pl with a = 8.435(4), b = 11.884(3), c = 12.869(7) A, (Y= 97.28(3), p = 91.66(5), y= 110.66(5)", V= unit cell dimensions 1193(2) A' .

Introduction

Polynuclear complexes of cis-(NH,),Pt(II) with the pyrimidine nucleobases uracil and thymine have been systematically studied for several reasons, e.g. the elucidation of ` platinum pyrimidine blues' the question , of Pt oxidation state and its stabilization in these compounds and the interaction of Pt and heterometals in related heteronuclear systems [l]. We have shown that cis-(NH,),Pt(II)L, where L are the deprotonated forms of the model nucleobases 1-methylthymine (lMeT) or 1-methyluracil (l-MeU), can be used as building blocks for the synthesis of dinuclear Pt(I1) complexes by condensation reactions with several mononuclear Pt complexes [2]. These dinuclear Pt(I1) complexes show a challenging oxidation behaviour, as they form a variety of larger aggregates through partial oxidation and formation of intermolecular Pt-Pt bonds [3]. There has also been a growing interest in heteronuclear complexes of gold and other transition metals like Pt, complexes which may have bridging ligands between gold and a second metal and may contain metal-metal bonds, mainly because of their possible role in catalysis. Our attempts to prepare a heteronuclear Pt,Au complex focused on the possibility of a Pt(III),Au(III) complex being formed, which would be an analogue

of a dinuclear Pt(II),Pt(III) complex. Au(II1) is isoelectronic with Pt(II), however, in contrast to Pt(I1) it cannot be oxidized further. Thus according to Pt(II),Au(III) -4 Pt(III),Au(III)

the preparation of a dinuclear Pt(III),Au(III) complex, representing the analogue of a never isolated dinuclear [Pt(2.5)12 complex with one unpaired electron, might be feasible. Previous results show that mixed-valence Pt complexes are stabilized with formation of a tetranuclear structure [4]. We have shown that cis-(NH,),Pt(l-MeT), reacts with PtCl,` resulting in the formation of the dinuclear -, Pt(I1) complex cis-(NH,),Pt(l-MeT),PtCl, [2]. We therefore studied the reaction behaviour of the isoelectronic Au(II1) entity towards the ci.+(NH,),Pt(lMeT), unit. We were aware that various possibilities exist. (i) Formation of the dinuclear species cis-[ (NH,),Pt( lMeT),AuCl,]Cl. (Because of the tendency of Au(II1) to form five- or six-coordinated species [5], larger aggregates seemed possible as well.) (ii) Occurrence of oxidation reactions. As Au(II1) is a strong oxidant, platinum(I1) complexes can be oxidized to Pt(IV) by AuCl,-. However, a chloride-assisted process does not always occur [6]. Oxidation of the ligand -NH, or, less likely, 1-methylthymineis possible too. (iii) Ligand protonation. This could be followed by loss of a nu-

cleobase ligand, eventually giving 1:l complexes or derivatives thereof, very much as in the case of Pt(I1) ]71. Reaction of NaAuCl, with cis-(NH,),Pt(l-MeT), yielded, among others, orange crystals, suitable for Xray analysis. As the characterization by spectroscopic techniques proved to be difficult, we undertook an Xray analysis.

Experimental Synthesis

cis-(NH,),Pt(l-MeT), was prepared according to ref. 8a. The title compound was prepared by reacting 0.2 mm01 of cis-(NH,),Pt(l-MeT),.H,O in 15 ml H,O with 0.2 mmol of NaAuCl,. After filtration from yellowish cis-[(NH,),Pt(l-MeT)(l-MeTH)] AuCl,.H20 (l), characterized by elemental analysis (Anal. Calc. for C,,H,,N,O,PtAuCl,: C, 16.55; H, 2.40; N, 9.70. Found: C, 16.66; H, 2.68; N, 9.71%) and IR spectroscopy by comparison with cis-[(NH,),Pt(l-MeT)(l-MeTH)]X, X1 2 = PtC&-) PtC162- ) the solution (pH 3) was allowed to crystallize at 4 "C. After 3 days, yelloworange crystals of 2, suitable for X-ray analysis, were isolated in 23% yield. Anal. Calc. for 2, C,,H,N,O,PtAuCl,: C, 16.0; H, 2.8; N, 9.4; Cl, 16.7.

IR (cm-` prominent bands only): 1660, , 1590, 1540, 1470, 1440 (double-bond stretching region); 360 (vAuC1). ` NMR (D,O, pD 3.4, ppm): 7.41 (H(6)); H 3.32 (N-CH& 1.79 (C-CH,).
Physical measurements

Data were measured with variable scan speed to ensure constant statistical precision on the collected intensities; the stability of the crystal was measured by monitoring 3 standards every hour. Data have been corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors and for the observed decay. An empirical absorption correction was applied using azimuthal (Icl> scans of two reflections (x> 85.9). The standard deviations on intensities were calculated in term of statistics alone. The structure was solved by a combination of Patterson and Fourier methods and refined by full matrix least-squares [9] (the function minimized was [&@,I - l/klF,])` ]). No extinction correction was deemed necessary. After refining to convergence the complete structural model with isotropic temperature factors for all atoms, a further empirical Fourier series based absorption correction was applied to the data set using the program DIFABS [9, lo]. For the final cycles of refinement anisotropic temperature factors were used for the Pt and oxygen atoms, the anion and the substituents of the l-MeT rings, all other atoms being treated isotropically. The scattering factors used, corrected for the real and imaginary parts of the anomalous dispersion, were taken from the literature [ll]. The contribution from the hydro en atoms in their idealized positions (C-H = 0.95 H B = 1.3 xB,,(C bonded) A' was taken into account' but not refined. ) Upon convergence (no parameter shift>0.2a@)) a Fourier difference map showed no significant feature. All calculations were carried out by using the MOLEN crystallographic package [9]. Final atomic coordinates and thermal factors are given in Table 2. See also ` Supplementary material' .

IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer, ` NMR spectra on a Bruker AM 300. The H X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements were made with a VG scientific instruments ESCA spectrometer using Al Ka radiation (1486.6 eV) as the Xray source. The powdered sample was dusted onto double-sided tape. All spectra were taken under a vacuum of about low8 torr. Binding energies were calibrated to the symmetric Cls line (285.0 eV). No X-ray damage was observed.
Crystallography

Results

A small, poorly diffracting, prismatic crystal was mounted on a glass fibre at a random orientation on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 diffractometer for the unit cell and space group determinations and for the data collection. Unit cell dimensions were obtained by a leastsquares fit of the 28 values of 25 high order reflections (8.3 < 8< 15.1) using the CAD4 centring routines. Selected crystallographic and other experimental parameters are listed in Table 1.

Reaction of cis-(NH,),PtL with NaAuCl, in aqueous solution always led to the formation of a yellowish precipitate, which was identified by IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis as cis-[(NH,),PtL(LH)]AuC1, (1). Protonation of the nucleobase ligand through the strongly acidic AuCl,- (solvolysis!) cannot be avoided, as pH adjustment leads to the formation of Au(OH), precipitates. Buffers proved to be unsuitable, too. In the case of L= l-MeT, however, it was possible to isolate crystals from the reaction mixture after filtration of 1. The IR spectrum of this compound 2 was considerably different from 1; UV spectra showed the r--r* absorption of the nucleobase at 267 nm. Absorptions of Pt(LH) species are typically around 285 nm. [Pt(III)], complexes display similar absorptions. For example, for a diplatinum(II1) complex containing two L= l-MeT bridging ligands (N3, 04) an absorption at 267 nm is observed [12].

ESCA has shown to be a useful tool for the determination of Pt oxidation states from Pt 4f binding energies. ESCA spectra of 2 show the doublet of Pt and Au in a 1:l ratio, the splitting of the Pt doublets is 3.2 eV, of the Au doublets 3.6 eV, consistent with the literature [13]. Pt(I1) complexes have Pt(4f,,) binding energies between 72.4 and 74.3 eV [14], Pt(IV) complexes between 75.5 and 76.7 eV. For 2, a Pt binding energy of 73.8 eV was measured, a value more in the Pt(I1) range. The Au (4f,,J value was measured to be 85.1 eV, thus being a little lower than the value typically expected for an Au(II1) chloro complex (87.3 eV for KAuCl,, 84.3-87.8 for several Au(II1) complexes, and 84.2-85.1 for Au(I) complexes [15,16]). From these data a possible interaction between Pt and Au could not be ruled out. Specifically, the oxidation state of the two metals remained unclear. The X-ray analysis of 2 finally showed that there was

no interaction between the two metal centres. Rather, the starting material was oxidized by Au(II1) to the platinum(IV) compound 2. Figure 1 shows the molecular cation of 2 and the atom numbering scheme. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 3. Coordination of Pt is through the deprotonated N3 position of the two 1-methylthyminato ligands, which are in cis position to each other. Two nitrogens of the ammine ligands and the two axial oxygens complete the almost octahedral coordination sphere of Pt(IV). Pt-NH, and Pt-N(nucleobase) distances are normal and compare well with data on related compounds [17-201. Dihedral angles between the nucleobases and the PtN, coordination plane are 55" (ring with N3) and 52" (ring with N3a), expectedly smaller than in Pt(I1) complexes and a consequence of steric interference of exocyclic nucleobase oxygens and axial O(1) and O(3) oxygens [19b].

considered (Fig. 2). Possibility (3) is considered least likely as there are no short hydrogen bonding contacts involving O(5) (cf. Table 4) in particular no such one in which O(5) acts as an H donor. Rather, in the H bond of 2.94 A between NH,(4) and O(5), O(5) acts as an acceptor. It is more difficult to rule out possibility (2). Although, in principle, it should be possible to differentiate between the anionic l-MeT and the neutral l-MeTH ligand on the basis of their geometries (cf. situation in cis-[(NH,),Pt(l-MeT)(l-MeTH)]+ [8] or cti-[(NH,),Pt(l-MeU)(l-MeUH)]+ [7], with l-MeUH = 1-methyluracil), the acidic proton of l-MeTH could be disordered over both rings, even though this is not realized in three previously solved structures. As with (3), there is no convincing argument from H bonding considerations, that (2) is the correct description of the situation in the solid state. This leaves (1) as the most reasonable possibility: the Pt-O(1) (2.06(2) A) and Pt-O(3) (1.94(2) A) separations are sufficiently different (4.3 0) to tentatively assign O(3) to a hydroxo ligand and O(1) to an aqua group. Comparison with related truns-Pt' "(OH), compounds [17, 18, 20, 211 seems to justify this interpretation. However, we are aware, that a disorder of OH and H,O is feasible, in principle. The packing diagram (Fig. 3) provides no indication for a direct intermolecular pathway for proton movement between OH and H,O ligands: there are no short contacts between O(1) and O(3) sites (Table
TABLE in 2 4. Selected non-bonded and hydrogen bonding distances

4) and while there is a strong H bond between O(1) and the water molecule O(5) (2.64(4) A), the latter is not hydrogen bonded to O(3). The only possibility for an H+ shuttle between the two sites would be via the NH,(4) group and would require intermediate formation of an amide species. There are two half AuCl,- entities, each located on a crystallographic inversion centre; their coordination is square-planar with normal Au-Cl bond lengths [22].

The Pt(I1) compound &(NH,),Pt(l-MeT), reacts with AuCl,- in aqueous solution with protonation to cis-[(NH,),Pt(l-MeT)(l-MeTH)][AuCl,] .H,O (1) and parallel with oxidation to ciS-[(NH&Pt( l-MeT),(OH)(OH,][AuCl,].H,O (2). 2 appears to be only the third structurally characterized bis(nucleobase) complex of Pt(IV) having a cis orientation of the two bases, the two others being Pt(IV) (cyclohexyldiamine) complexes of 9-methylguanine [23]. Previously studied bis(nucleobase) complexes of Pt(IV) containing pyrimidine bases were without exception of a truns geometry [18, 201. A noteworthy detail of the formation of 2 is that the cation does not contain a Cl bound to Pt, even though Cl - was present in solution from which the compound crystallized. We assume that this is so due to steric crowding caused by the exocyclic oxygens of l-MeT. While in cti,cis,trans-[(dach)Pt(9_MeGHN7),C1,]2' (dach = diaminocyclohexane, 9-MeGH = 9methylguanine) Pt can still accommodate two axial chlorides without serious deviations from octahedral geometry [23], the situation in the bis(nucleobase) complexes containing N(3) bound pyrimidine nucleobases is much tighter. This argument probably also holds for a tram orientation of the two pyrimidine nucleobases, considering our failure [18b] to prepare of trans-[(NH,),Pt(l-MeC-N3),a Cl derivative (OH)(OH,)] + (l-MeC = 1-methylcytosine) via HCl treatment.
