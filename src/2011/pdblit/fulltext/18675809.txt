Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays an important role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses in mammals. The IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), a soluble receptor that specifically binds IL-22, prevents the IL-22/interleukin-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1)/interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) complex assembly and blocks IL-22 biological activity. Here we present the crystal structure of the IL-22/IL-22BP complex at 2.75 Å resolution. The structure reveals IL-22BP residues critical for IL-22 binding, which were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies. Comparison of IL-22/IL-22BP and IL-22/IL-22R1 crystal structures shows that both receptors display an overlapping IL-22 binding surface, which is consistent with the inhibitory role played by IL-22 binding protein.

1. Introduction Interleukins (ILs) are cytokines that regulate a variety of physiological and pathological conditions such as normal and malignant cell growth, as well as immune and inflammatory responses, which makes them obvious targets for clinical applications [1,2]. Some cytokines have pro-inflammatory activities, whereas others promote healing by reducing inflammation. Among these cytokines, interleukin-22 (IL-22) is involved in the generation of inflammatory and immune responses that lead to the development of several illnesses such as Crohn's disease [3], interstitial lung disease [4], rheumatoid arthritis [5], and psoriasis [6]. On the other hand, IL-22 has a protective role in liver injury by promoting hepatocyte survival [7,8]. IL-22 also induces the production of antimicrobial

proteins in human keratinocytes [9] and in lung and gut mucosae from mice [10]. Taken together, these findings point out that IL-22 is involved in innate pathogen defense, wound healing, and regulation of tissue inflammation by mediating the cross talk between the immune system and epithelial cells [11]. Interleukin-22 is a member of the interleukin 10 (IL-10) super family of cytokines and it is produced by activated NK and T cells [12,13]. Nevertheless, a distinct lineage of T helper type 17 cells (TH17 lineage) expressing IL-22 has recently been identified [14]. Human IL-22 is a 20 kDa-a-helical protein that signals through its binding to class II cytokine family cell surface receptors, interleukin-22 receptor 1 (IL-22R1) (cytokine receptor family class 2 member 9, CRF2-9) and interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) (the second chain of the IL-10 receptor complex, CRF2­4) [15]. While IL-10R2 is ubiquitously expressed, the IL-22R1 is expressed in a limited number of normal tissues such as skin, kidney, liver, colon, small intestine, lung, and pancreas [9,15]. IL-22 first associates with the extracellular domain of IL-22R1 and subsequently with the extracellular domain of IL-10R2, which binds to a specific surface created by the interaction between IL-22 and the IL-22R1. This results in the assembly of a cytokine receptor complex with higher affinity for IL-22 [16]. Very recently, the three-dimensional structures of the IL-22/IL22R1 complex, which were published independently by two different groups [17,18], revealed that IL-22 has distinct binding sites for

the extracellular domains of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2. While IL-22R1 loops interact with IL-22 residues within helices A and F, and loop AB, the IL-10R2 binding site is formed by IL-22 hot spot residues located on helices A and D, as described previously [19]. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies showed that IL22R1 residues Lys58 and Tyr60 are crucial for IL-22 binding [17]. In addition to its cellular receptor, IL-22 binds to a 25 kDa-secreted protein termed interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) (cytokine receptor family class 2 member 10 (CFR2-10) or IL-22 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-22Ra2)), which is highly expressed in breast, placenta, skin, lungs, spleen, and colon [20­22]. IL22BP is a soluble receptor that lacks both trans-membrane and intracellular domains, and it is highly related to the extracellular domains of class II cytokine receptors IL-22R1 and IL-20Ra. Cross-linking experiments showed that IL-22BP specifically binds IL-22 with high affinity. Thus, IL-22BP prevents the interaction of IL-22 with the functional cell surface receptor complex and acts as a natural IL-22 antagonist [20­22]. This antagonism may be important for the regulation of inflammatory responses induced by IL-22. Here we describe the crystal structure of the IL-22/IL-22BP complex at 2.75 Å resolution, which reveals the molecular basis of IL-22 recognition by its decoy receptor. The importance of key amino acid residues identified by the structure was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of IL-22BP and functional studies. The IL-22/IL-22BP three-dimensional structure reveals for the first time the molecular mode of IL-22BP antagonism of IL-22 action. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Complex crystallization, structure determination, and refinement A single crystal of the IL-22/IL-22BP complex was obtained from a solution consisting of 10% PEG 6000 and 5% MPD [23]. A complete data set was collected at the W01B-MX2 beam line at the Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron (Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil) [24]. The IL-22/IL-22BP structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the IL-22/IL-22R1 complex (PBD 3DLQ). The model was refined alternating cycles of model manipulation in COOT [25] and refinement in PHENIX [26]. Stereochemical analysis was performed with PROCHECK [27]. The statistics for data processing and model refinement are given in Table 1. Buried surface area was calculated using PISA [28] and PROTORP [29] servers. Figures and the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) calculations were done using PyMOL [30]. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of IL-22/IL-22BP complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 3G9V. 2.2. Cellular assays for IL-22BP and IL-22R1 To allow for its cell surface expression, the mIL-22BP open reading frame (ORF) cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen) containing the sequence coding for the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) trans-membrane domain. Mutagenesis on hIL-22R1 and mIL-22BP was performed by using the GeneEditor in vitro Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Promega). Clones obtained were sequenced using the DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Kit (Amersham Biosciences). For stable transfections, 5 Â 106 BW5147 cells were electroporated (270 V, 74 X, 1500 lF) with 50 lg of sterile DNA in 800 ll complete medium, and selected using puromycine (1.6 lg/ mL; Sigma). Cells expressing the receptor constructs were sorted by fluorescent automatic cell sorter (FACS) analysis with a mouse monoclonal anti-hIL-22R antibody (MH22R6.6) or a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-IL-22BP (AM22BP.4), followed by fluores-

Proliferation assays were performed as described previously [17]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Quality of the model We determined the crystal structure of the IL-22/IL-22BP complex at 2.75 Å resolution (Table 1). There are two IL-22/IL-22BP complexes (B/A and D/C) in the crystallographic asymmetric unit related by a non-crystallographic twofold axis. These heterodimers are essentially identical (0.098 Å r.m.s.d. for 285 Ca atoms), and thereafter the coordinates of the B/A complex will be considered for structural and comparison analyses. The final model includes IL-22BP residues 29­225 and 26­223 (for chains A and C, respectively), IL-22 residues 38­178 and 41­179 (for chains B and D, respectively), and 221 water molecules. Several polypeptide fragments of IL-22BP (chains A and C, residues 53­55, 137­141, 177­182, 196­205) and IL-22 (chain B, residues 134­139; chain D, residues 131­139) were not included in the final model because of poor or disordered electron density. The Ramachandran plot indicated that a total of 88.8% and 11.2% of the 835 amino acid residues were in the most favorable and additionally allowed regions, respectively, and no residues were found in the disallowed regions.

3.2. Overall IL-22/IL-22BP complex architecture In the IL-22/IL-22BP complex, the IL-22 molecule folds in a compact bundle of six anti-parallel a-helices, whereas the IL-22BP molecule folds in an L-shaped structure consisting of two fibronectinIII domains (FBN-III) in tandem (Fig. 1A). Each FBN-III domain consists of a sandwich of two anti-parallel b-sheets formed from seven b-strands (A, B, E and C, C0 , F, and G). The N-terminal D1 domain (residues 29­121) is connected to the C-terminal D2 domain (residues 126­225) by a small 310 a-helix (residues 122­125). IL-22BP

D1 and D2 domains display an interdomain angle of 125°, which is similar to that described for the extracellular portion of the IL22R1 chain (121°) [17], and 10° larger than that observed in the interleukin-10 receptor 1 (IL-10R1) chain (115°) [31]. There are two disulfide bridges in the IL-22BP structure: the first between Cys78 and Cys86, that connects strands C0 with E (in the D1 domain), and the second that links b-strand F (Cys206) to b-strand G (Cys227) in the D2 domain (Supplementary Fig. S1). The first disulfide bridge is structurally equivalent to Cys71/Cys79 (IL-22R1) and Cys66/Cys74 (IL-10R2), but it is not equivalent to Cys56/Cys75 (IL-10R1) that connects b-strands C0 with C. The second disulfide bridge of IL-22BP is conserved in IL10R1, IL-10R2, and all other class II cytokine receptors, but it is not equivalent to the disulfide bridge of IL-22R1 that links b-strand A (Cys128) to b-strand G (Cys217). Thus, there is a difference in the Cys/Cys connectivity of the C-terminal D2 domains of IL-22BP and IL-22R1. Sequence alignments show that human IL-22BP has 34%, 29%, and 30% amino acid identity with the extracellular domains of IL22R1, IL-10R1, and IL-10R2, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). Although IL-22BP and IL-22R1 share limited amino acid sequence identity, the three-dimensional structure of IL-22BP is topologically very similar to the extracellular portion of IL-22R1 (1.68 Å r.m.s.d., 119 Ca atoms). IL-22BP D1 (residues 29­121) domain is structurally most similar to D1 (residues 20­113) of IL-22R1 (0.81 Å r.m.s.d, 76 Ca atoms). On the other hand, IL-22BP D2 (residues 126­225) domain exhibits considerable primary structure differences with D2 (residues 119­228) of IL-22R1 (21% amino acid identity), which leads to a significant dissimilarity in their 3D structures (3.57 Å r.m.s.d., 51 Ca atoms). 3.3. Molecular details of the IL-22/IL-22BP binding interface IL-22BP contacts IL-22 using five binding loops (L2­L6) (Fig. 1A), as observed for the IL-22/IL-22R1 and IL-10/IL-10R1 complexes [17,18,31]. At the D1 domain (site 1a), IL-22BP residues within loops L2­L4 form 16 hydrogen bond/salt bridge interactions with

IL-22 residues located in the loop AB (Asp67, Thr70, Asp71, Val72, Arg73, Glu77) and on the bend in helix F1 (Lys162, Gly165, Glu166) (Fig. 1B). The IL-22BP residue Tyr67 dominates the molecular recognition of IL-22 by IL-22BP. Tyr67 makes five direct contacts and one water-mediated interaction with IL-22 residues, including Lys162 and Glu166 that are part of the IL-10 signature (162KAIGELDLL). In addition, three IL-22BP residues (Lys65, Glu97, and Arg119) form five salt bridge interactions with IL-22 residues located on the AB loop (Supplementary Table S1). There are fewer electrostatic interactions at the D2 domain (site 1b) (Fig. 1C). IL-22BP loops L5 and L6 contact IL-22 residues located on the beginning of helices pre-A (Phe47) and A (Thr53, Asn54, Phe57), and the C-terminus of helix F2 (Phe171, Met172, Arg175). The two large aromatic residues Trp123 and Trp124 of IL-22BP interact with the hydrophobic patch formed by hydrophobic residues (Phe47, Phe57, Phe171, and Met172) of IL-22 and IL22BP residues Met215 and Leu216. In addition to hydrophobic interactions, IL-22BP residues Glu168, Met215, and Leu216 are involved in some hydrogen bond/salt bridge contacts across the site 1b interface (Supplementary Table S1). Very recently, Jones and co-workers, used homology modeling of the IL-22/IL-22BP complex to propose five putative interactions at the IL-22/IL-22BP interface: Lys44/Glu168, Gln48/Met215, Asn54/Asp217, Lys61/Glu125, and Arg175/Glu168 [18]. Our IL22/IL-22BP crystal structure reveals that only one of them, the salt bridge interaction Arg175/Glu168, exists across the binding interface. The other four potential hydrogen bonds do not occur as the distances between the side chains of the correspondent residues are all greater than 5 Å. 3.4. Structural comparison of IL-22/IL-22BP and IL-22/IL-22R1 binding interfaces The IL-22/IL-22BP complex structure is similar to IL-22/IL-22R1 (2.70 Å r.m.s.d., 259 Ca atoms; PDB 3DLQ) and IL-22/sIL-22R1 (2.86 Å r.m.s.d., 263 Ca atoms; PDB 3DGC) crystal structures (Fig. 2A). Upon IL-22/IL-22BP complex formation, 26 IL-22 residues

and 25 IL-22BP residues bury a total surface area of 1820 Å2. Similarly, 51 residues of the IL-22/IL-22R1 interface bury 1710 Å2 of surface area [17]. However, 23 electrostatic contacts are formed between IL-22 and IL-22BP, whereas only 16 hydrogen bond/salt bridge interactions are found in the IL-22/IL-22R1 binding interface (Fig. 2B and C). In both IL-22/IL-22BP and IL-22/IL-22R1 complexes, site 1a accounts for the majority of the total buried surface area between IL-22 and IL-22BP (1127 Å2) or IL-22R1 (996 Å2). Moreover, site 1a contains 10 conserved hydrogen bond/salt bridge interactions (Supplementary Table S2). These electrostatic contacts are formed between eight IL-22 residues and IL-22BP residues Lys65, Tyr67, Gly68, Glu97, and Arg119, which are structurally equivalent to IL-22R1 residues Lys58, Tyr60, Gly61, Glu90, and Arg112, respectively (Fig. 2B). Three of the six salt bridges found in the IL-22/IL22BP site 1a (Asp67/Arg119, Asp71/Lys65, Arg73/Glu97) are conserved in the IL-22/IL-22R1 complex (Asp67/Arg112, Asp71/ Lys58, Arg73/Glu90). These conserved interactions are important in the stabilization of both complex structures.

In addition to the electrostatic interactions, both complexes contain a hydrophobic cluster located at site 1b, which buries 776 Å2 and 720 Å2 of IL-22/IL-22BP and IL-22/IL-22R1 interface areas, respectively (Fig. 2C). Superposition of binary complexes reveals that IL-22/IL-22R1 site 1b contains a smaller hydrophobic cluster and fewer solvent-exposed non-polar residues than IL-22/ IL-22BP site 1b. Interestingly, there is a unique salt bridge interaction formed between IL-22BP residue Glu168 and IL-22 helix F2 residue Arg175. This salt bridge does not exist in the IL-22/IL22R1 site 1b interface because the side chain of Arg175 adopts a different conformation to interact with Thr207 from IL-22R1. Additionally, one conserved water molecule mediates the interaction between IL-22 residues Phe47 and Thr53 with residues Met216 (of IL-22BP) and Pro216 (of IL-22R1). Very recently, a detailed mutagenesis study has identified four and 12 IL-22 residues that are important for IL-22BP and IL-22R1 binding, respectively [32]. Among these IL-22 residues, Asp67, Arg73, and Lys162 side chains are critical for optimal binding to IL-22BP and IL-22R1, which is consistent with the result from the

structural comparison of IL-22/IL-22BP and IL-22/IL-22R1 crystallographic models (Fig. 2A­C). 3.5. The molecular recognition of IL-22 by IL-22BP and IL-22R1 receptors Analysis of the IL-22/IL-22BP and IL-22/IL-22R1 binding interfaces showed that IL-22BP and IL-22R1 bind to similar surfaces on IL-22 (Fig. 2A­C). Comparison of surface electrostatic potential at the IL-22/IL-22BP and IL-22/IL-22R1 interfaces reveals good charge complementarity at site 1a (Fig. 2D and E). Nevertheless, there are lower electrostatic and hydrophobic complementarities between IL-22 and IL-22R1 at the site 1b interface. An interesting feature of the IL-22 binding interface is the presence of a shallow cavity formed by residues within helix F1 (Lys162, Gly165, Glu166) and loop AB (Asp67), where the hydroxyl group of Tyr67 residue from IL-22BP is inserted (Fig. 2D). IL-22BP Tyr67 is structurally equivalent to IL-22R1 Tyr60, and the latter fits into the same cavity formed by the intersection between IL-22 helix F1 and loop AB (Fig. 2E). However, IL-22BP Tyr67 makes more direct electrostatic interactions with IL-22 residues than Tyr60 of IL22R1 [17]. The binding of IL-22 to IL-22BP is of extremely high affinity (Kd $ 1 pM), in comparison with the high binding affinity between IL-22 and the extracellular domain of IL-22R1 (Kd $ 20 nM) [18]. Our X-ray structure of the IL-22/IL-22BP complex and its comparison with IL-22/IL-22R1 reveal a number of structural differences in the recognition of IL-22 by IL-22BP and IL-22R1 that shed light on the differences in their binding affinities. First, the number of electrostatic interactions found at the IL-22/IL-22BP interface is higher, as evidenced by the higher degree of charge complementarity compared with the IL-22/IL-22R1 interface. Second, eight of 10 conserved electrostatic interactions are shorter in the IL-22/IL22BP site 1a interface, indicating that IL-22BP binds to IL-22 more tightly. Third, IL-22BP makes more direct protein­protein interactions, whereas IL-22R1 shows direct and water-mediated interactions with IL-22. Finally, the IL-22/IL-22BP complex contains a larger hydrophobic cluster centered at site 1b that contributes to strengthen the interaction between IL-22 and IL-22BP. Thus, the combined effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts across

the IL-22/IL-22BP binding interface contribute to the high binding affinity of the complex. 3.6. Determination of the IL-22BP functional epitopes by site-directed mutagenesis To assess the functional importance of the IL-22BP residues for IL-22 binding, we mutated key amino acid residues located at the complex interface using site-directed mutagenesis. Two IL-22BP residues were chosen (Tyr67 and Arg119), due to their participation in several hydrogen bond/salt bridge interactions with the IL-22 molecule (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). These selected residues are structurally equivalent to Tyr66 and Arg118 residues from murine IL-22BP (mIL-22BP). Thus, two murine mutants were generated (Y66A and R118A) in order to test their abilities to bind to murine IL-22 (mIL-22) in a cell-based assay. These mutations were inserted into a cell surface version of mIL-22BP obtained by cloning the IL-22BP ORF in frame with the PDGF-R trans-membrane domain. Wild type mIL-22BP was used as an internal control. While human and murine IL-22 share 79% amino acid identity, human IL-22BP has 67% sequence identity with its murine ortholog (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). According to the amino acid sequence alignments, murine residues Tyr66 and Arg118 are all conserved in human IL-22BP (hIL-22BP) and IL-22R1 (hIL-22R1). At the IL-22/IL-22BP interface, hIL-22BP Tyr67 side chain forms an extensive hydrogen bond network with Asp67, Val72, Lys162, and Glu166 residues of IL-22. These interactions have their counterparts in the IL-22/IL-22R1 complex, where IL-22R1 Tyr60 makes direct and water-mediated interactions with the same IL-22 residues (Fig. 2B). In order to check the importance of Tyr67 for IL22/IL-22BP binding, the structurally equivalent murine residue Tyr66 was mutated to an Ala residue. The mIL-22BP Y66A mutation completely abolished mIL-22 binding (Fig. 3A). The same result was obtained for IL-22R1 mutants Y60R and Y60A that completely failed to respond to IL-22 [17], indicating that a tyrosine residue at this position in IL-22R1 and IL-22BP is critical for IL-22 binding. Another important salt bridge found at the IL-22 molecular interface involves IL-22 residue Asp67 and hIL-22BP residue Arg119, which is structurally equivalent to Arg112 of IL-22R1

Left panels, 105 BWIL-22BP cells from two independent experiments were analyzed by FACS with a biotinylated anti-IL22BP monoclonal antibody (0.5 lg/mL) followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin labeling. Right panels, 105 BWIL-22BP cells were analyzed by FACS for the binding of biotinylated mIL-22 (6.8 ng/mL). The binding was detected with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. (C) Inhibition of BWhIL-22R1 cell proliferation. BWhIL-22R1 (WT or mutant R112A) cells were stimulated in triplicates with various dilutions of hIL-22 for 72 h and proliferation was assessed by measuring H3-thymidine incorporation. The results correspond to the mean and SD from triplicate cultures.

(Fig. 2B). In order to assess the functional role of Arg119 residue for IL-22/IL-22BP binding, the structurally equivalent murine residue Arg118 was mutated to an Ala residue. The murine R118A point mutant affected partially the mIL-22BP expression, but it completely abolished mIL-22 binding (Fig. 3B). When Arg112 was mutated to an Ala residue, the IL-22R1 R112A mutant completely abolished the IL-22 response, reflecting its importance in IL-22/ IL-22R1 binding (Fig. 3C).
