[14] Preparation and Use of 2H-Labeled RNA Oligonucleotides in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies
B y EDWARD P. NIKONOWICZ

Introduction Multidimensional double- and triple-resonance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have extended the size and complexity of proteins and nucleic acids that can be studied in solution by increasing spectral resolution and providing the means to correlate resonances exclusively through scalar coupled pathways. The widespread application of these experiments has been fueled by the development and refinement of methods for facile preparation of uniformly 13C,15N_labeled molecules. However, the sensitivity of these heteronuclear experiments and the resolution of the resulting spectra degrade as molecular correlation time increases, leading to more efficient relaxation of the nuclear spins. 1'2 Deuterium enrichment is a general strategy used to simplify 1H NMR spectra and to lessen the problems associated with efficient relaxation. For more than 30 years, deuterium isotope enrichment has aided solution-state studies of biological macromolecules. 3 Prior to 1993, deuteration was employed in homonuclear NMR for resonance editing, linewidth narrowing, and spectral simplification through reduction of LH-1H scalar coupling.4 Since then, deuterium enrichment has been coupled with biosynthetic 13C and 15N labeling of large (>20 kDa) proteins and has led to the development of a multitude of heteronuclear experiments that utilize the favorable relaxation properties imparted by the 2H nucleus. 1'2'5 Deuteration of nucleic acids and NMR methodological applications for these molecules have been slower to evolve, in part due to the composition of nucleic acid spin systems relative to proteins. For example, there are no exchangeable sites along the phosphate backbone, analogous to the amide positions, that can be used for scalar sequential resonance assignment of perdeuterated molecules. This article describes the biosynthetic preparation of deuterated 13C- and 15N-labeled RNA oligonucleotides. The effects of deuterium enrichment on the relaxation of 13C- and 15N-bound protons and on the quality of scalar and nuclear overhauser effects (NOE) based spectra also are presented.

The labeled 5'-nucleoside triphosphates (5'-NTPs) used in the T7 RNA polymerase directed synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides were prepared from ribosomal RNA isolated from Escherichia coli cultured in appropriately labeled minimal media. 6,7 Fractional deuteration of rRNA is achieved using minimal media composed of 50-90% 2H20 and containing protonated sodium acetate ([1H3]acetate), and perdeuteration is achieved using minimal media composed of 90% 2H20 and sodium deuterioacetate ([2H3]acetate), The purine C8 and pyrimidine C5 atoms of the deuterated 5'-nucleoside monophosphates (5'-NMPs) can be protonated using bisulfite modification before conversion to the 5'-NTPs to prepare deuterated oligonucleotides "labeled" with H5 and H8. Bisulfite modification also can be used to prepare 13C- and 15N-labeled RNA oligonucleotides that are specifically deuterated at C5 or C8. Deuteration of nucleic acids increases the signal-to-noise of NOE-based experiments and improves the resolution of NOE-based and scalarcorrelated experiments. Procedures

presumably due to the additional buffering capacity of the media. Stock solutions of MgSO4 (1 M), thiamin (2.5 mg/ml), and nicotinamide (1.3 mg/ml) are prepared using 99.8% sterile 2H20 and added to each flask in the amounts 675/zl, 330/zl, and 110/zl, respectively. The (NH4)2SO4 (220 mg) is added to each flask as a powder. The sodium acetate is dissolved in 15.0 ml 99.8% 2H20 and the pH* adjusted to 7.3 (uncorrected for deuterium) with ~60 ~1 12.5 M HC1, and 5.0 ml is added to each flask. The trace metals solution (167/zl) is added last. The cells are adapted to 2H20 and to acetate as the sole carbon source by passage through a series of increasingly stringent culture conditions (Fig. 1). Five ml of LB medium (composed of 10% 2H20 and 90% 1H20) is inoculated with a single colony of E. coli grown overnight on an agar plate (Ix LB media with 1.5% agar). 8 The culture is incubated at 37 ° with shaking (200 rpm) until it reaches an optical density of 1.2 (A60o).The culture is diluted 1 : 25 into 10 ml of prewarmed minimal medium composed of 25% 2H20, 0.2% glucose (w/v), and 0.1% sodium acetate (w/v). The cells are passed sequentially through minimal media (50%, 75%, and 92% 2H20) with 0.3% (w/v) sodium acetate as the sole carbon source, each time diluting 1 : 25. The 92% 2H20 culture is used as the inoculum for the preparative scale labeled cultures. At an A600 of 0.8, the 92% 2H20 culture is divided among 2 liter baffled flasks at a 1 : 20 dilution. The 330 ml cultures are incubated at 37 ° with shaking (240 rpm) until the A60o is 1.6, and the cells are harvested by centrifugation and frozen at - 2 0 °. The doubling time of the cultures is 3-4 hr in 1H20 for both [1H3]acetate and [2H3]acetate. The doubling time increases to 6-7 hr when the cells are cultured in 90% 2H20. To reduce the cost of deuterated NMP production incurred by the 2H20, the water from the preparative-scale cultures can be recycled. After the cells are harvested, each liter of medium is filtered through glass wool, stirred for 1 hr with 15 g of 50-200 mesh activated carbon, and filtered through a Whatman (Clifton, NJ) No. 1 filter disk. The pH of the filtered water is set to 12 using 40% NaOD and the water is refluxed for 2 hr. After cooling, the pH is adjusted to --~8.2 with 12.5 MDC1 and the water distilled under reduced pressure at 60 ° using rotary evaporation. The 2H20 content of the recycled water varies <2% (using the buoyant density method as detailed 9) from the theoretical estimate based on the initial 2H20 content of the cell culture medium.

All steps are performed on ice. The frozen cell paste (~5.8 g/liter of culture) is thawed and 5 ml of RB and 0.1 mg of DNase I are added. A Dounce tissue grinder (Kontes) is used to homogenize the cell suspension. An additional 5 ml of RB is used to rinse the tissue grinder, combined with the cell suspension, and the mixture incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells are then disrupted by passage through a prechilled (4 °) French press five times at 1200 psi. The cell debris is removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 rpm using a Beckman JA-20 fixed angle rotor. The supernate is decanted and the cell debris is washed twice with RB (5 ml per wash). The supernates (~20 ml) are combined, and the ribosomes purified by

Extraction of rRNA Materials
0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) 0.1 M Sodium acetate (pH 8.0) 10% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (pH 7.2 with 5 M HC1) Phenol (with 0.05% 8-hydroxyquinoline and equilibrated against 100 mM sodium acetate) Chloroform : isoamyl alcohol (24 : 1) solution All steps are performed on ice and all glassware was baked at 200 ° for 4 hr. The ribosome pellet is thawed on ice and 5 ml of prechilled 0.1 M sodium acetate and 100/zl of 0.5 M EDTA are added. The ribosomes are dispersed by sonication using a cup attachment (Ultrasonics Incorporated, Plainview, NY). SDS (10%) is added to a final concentration of 0.5% and the suspension is mixed by vortexing. For the first extraction of the ribosomes, 4 ml of phenol is added, followed by 1 ml of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol solution, and the aqueous phase (top layer) is removed to a clean tube using a Pasteur pipette. For the second extraction, the volume ratio for water : phenol:chloroform is 2 : 1 : 1 and the aqueous phase is again transferred to a clean tube. Using the same volume ratio, two more extractions are performed, followed by a final chloroform : isoamyl alcohol extraction of the aqueous phase. The organic phases of the four phenol : chloroform extractions and the final chloroform extraction are themselves back-extracted three times each with 0.1 M sodium acetate (~5 ml each time). All aqueous phases are combined, the volume (~30 ml) reduced 50% by rotary evaporation, and the rRNA precipitated from ethanol for 16 hr at - 2 0 °. After centrifugation, the liquid is decanted and the rRNA pellet is dried under vacuum for 10 min.

is added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Nuclease P1 is added (1 IU/300 A260 OD units) and the solution incubated at 45 ° for 2 hr. The digestion is monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using polyethyleneimine TLC plates and 1.0 M LiC1 as the developing solution.l° After completion of the reaction, EDTA is added to 1.0 mM and the solution heated to 90 ° for I min and then frozen at - 2 0 °.

Chromatographic Separation of 5'-NMPs
Milligram quantities of each of the four 5'-NMPs can be resolved using the anion-exchange procedure of Cohn. I1 The 5'-NMPs are separated in order to prepare ribonucleotides that are uniformly deuterated except at the purine C8 and pyrimidine C5 or C6 positions. Fully protonated 13C,15N-labeled 5'-NMPs also are separated to prepare ribonucleotides that are specifically deuterated at C8, and C5 or C6.

Materials
Anion-exchange resin (AG l-X2, 100-200 mesh) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) Affi-Gel 601 boronate-derivatized polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) Triethylamine (neat) 1 M Formic acid 1 M Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEABC), pH 9.4 1 M NaOH HNO3 1% AgNO3

Preparation of Anion-Exchange Column. The AG l-X2 resin is prepared by exchange from the chloride form to the formate form. Approximately 50 ml of preswollen resin is mixed with 100 ml of distilled water to form a slurry and is poured into a 2.5 cm i.d. chromatography column forming a 13 cm bed (50 ml). The resin is then washed with 1.3 liter of 1.0 M NaOH. The column wash is tested for the presence of chloride ion by acidifying a 1 ml aliquot of effluent with HNO3 and adding 100/zl of 1% AgNO3. A clear solution indicates the exchange is complete and a white precipitate indicates that chloride ion is still present on the resin and that the resin requires additional NaOH wash. The resin is next washed with H20 until the effluent pH is <9. Next, 1.0 M formic acid is applied to the column until the pH of the effluent is <2, and then the resin is rinsed with H20 until the pH of the effluent is >5.

Separation and Desalting of 5'-NMPs. Ethanol precipitated 5'-NMPs (~3100 A260 OD units or 100 mg calculated using an average e260 = 11,100) are dissolved in 10 ml H20, the pH is adjusted to 8.0 with 3.0 M KOH, and the sample is loaded onto the column. The column is washed with distilled H20 at a flow rate of 7 ml/min until the A26o absorbance of the effluent no longer changes and a steady A260 baseline is achieved. 5'-CMP is eluted from the column first using 0.1 M formic acid (pH 2.3-2.4). After the A260 absorbance peak corresponding to elution of the 5'-CMP begins to decrease, the column buffer is changed to 1.0 M formic acid. Y-AMP elutes second and is followed by 5'-GMP. 5'-UMP is the last to elute from the column, and its removal is accelerated by bringing the column elution buffer to 0.1 M HC1. The typical elution volumes that we have generated for 100 mg of mixed 5'-NMPs are 160, 90, 860, and 190 ml for 5'-CMP, 5'-AMP, 5'-GMP, and 5'-UMP, respectively. The 5'-NMP fractions are neutralized using NH4OH and rotary evaporated to reduce the volume of each 5'-NMP solution to ~ 10 ml. The 5'-NMPs are desalted using the Affi-Gel 601 resin, which is specific for cis-diols (i.e., 5'-rNMPs). 12 Triethylamine (1.7-3.0 ml) is added to each solution to raise the pH to 9.4 before loading the 5'-NMPs onto the affinity column. Once loaded, the column is washed with 150 ml of 1 M TEABC (prepared by bubbling CO2 through a 1 M solution of triethylamine until pH 9.4 is reached). The 5'-NMPs are eluted using water acidified with bicarbonate to pH 4.5 (by bubbling CO2 through distilled water) and lyophilized to remove triethylammonium bicarbonate salt. A total of 2950 A260 OD units is recovered. Reverse Protonation and Deuteration of Base Positions C5, C6, and C8 in 5'-NMPs

The exchangeable NH and NH2 protons are key to the determination of nucleic acid secondary structure and to identification of global folds through tertiary contacts. Additional details of nucleic acid structure such as base stacking and glycosidic torsion angle can be extracted using the 5, 6, and 8 base protons. However, since the biosynthetic methods for preparing deuterated nucleotides lead to extensive deuteration of the base carbons, it is necessary to selectively protonate these positions.

fresh and their pH is adjusted to 8.0 and 7.8 using freshly prepared 0.9 M Na2S205 [~7 ml and 15 ml, respectively, per 100 ml (NH4)2SO3 solution]. The C8 and C5 exchange reactions are carried out at pH 8.0 and pH 7.8, respectively. The exchange reactions contain 30 mM 5'-NMPs and 300 mM (NH4)2SO3 and are incubated at 65 °. The reactions are monitored using 1H NMR, and exchange at C8 and C5 is >95% complete after ~60 hr and ~72 hr, respectively. Exchange at the ribose carbons, adenine C2, or pyrimidine C6 has not been detected. After the reactions are complete, the 5'-NMPs are precipitated at - 2 0 ° by addition of three volumes of ethanol, resuspended in 1M TEABC (pH 9.4), and desalted using the cis-diol affinity column (as above). Although exchange at the pyrimidine C6 positions is not catalyzed by this method, protonation of C6 can be accomplished using an alkaline solution of 40% 1H20 and 60% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). t4 This method also leads to exchange at C5 and proceeds to ~70% completion before the 5'-UMP and 5'-CMP begin to decompose. Preparation of 5'-NTPs and Synthesis of RNA Oligonucleotides. The labeled 5'-NTPs are enzymatically phosphorylated at 37 ° by reacting the desalted 5'NMPs with 2.5 equivalents of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (Bachen, Torrance, CA) under N2 as detailed.l°, 12 Progress of the reaction is monitored by HPLC using an analytical anion-exchange column (Vydac) and usually is complete within 12 hr. The IH and J3C NMR spectra of the 5'-NTPs indicate that phosphorylation and purification of the NTPs do not lead to exchange at the deuterated carbon positions. Published protocols for in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase are used to produce labeled RNA molecules) 5 Yields from transcription reactions using 2H/J3C/15N-labeled 5'-NTPs and 13C/15N-tabeled 5'-NTPs are comparable. P r e p a r a t i o n of D e u t e r a t e d RNA The biosynthetic approach to deuteration of RNA provides a simple route to RNAs that are uniformly 13C,tSN-labeled and specifically protonated in the bases. This approach does not result in highly selective deuteration, but chemical methods can be used to selectively protonate pyrimidine C5 and C6 and purine C8 positions. Cells cultured in 90% 2H20 using either [2H3]acetate or [IH3]acetate yield comparable amounts of rRNA, 660/zmol/g and 600 #tool/g, respectively. (The number of moles is calculated using an average extinction coefficient of e260 = 11,100 at 260 nm for the mixture of 5:-NMPs generated from the nuclease P 1 digest of rRNA.) This yield is approximately 65% less per gram of carbon source than we have obtained from cells cultured using glucose and H20. However, the hydrogen atoms of glucose do not undergo significant exchange with the solvent during nucleoside biosynthesis, necessitating the use of [2HT]glucose to produce

The percent isotopicenrichments were estimated from integrated peak areas in one-dimensional 2H/13C/15N-decoupledIH and IH/2H/15Ndecoupled 13Cspectra. The recoverydelays for the 1H and 13Cexperiments were 10 s and 15 s, respectively. b The distribution of 13Cisotope using 13C-1sodium acetate as the sole carbon source is consistent with the distribution that 13C-2 sodium acetate yields. high levels of deuteration. The fractional contributions of solvent and acetate to the 2H enrichment of ribonucleotide carbons were estimated from one-dimensional 13C N M R spectra and are listed in Table I. In medium that is 80% 2H20, [2H3]acetate leads to 9 0 - 9 5 % 2H enrichment at all of the ribose carbon positions. Enrichment at the adenine C2 and purine C8 is 85% and 90%, respectively, and at the pyrimidine C6 and C5 is 90% and 88%, respectively. If [1H3]acetate is used as the carbon source in 90% 2H20 media, the enrichment of the ribose C 1 ' - C 4 ' is extensive with > 68% deuteration. The C5' is approximately 56% enriched with one deuteron and has a slight stereospecific preference (12-15%) for deuterium at the pro-S position. Finally, 38% of the ribose C5' positions are enriched with two deuterons and 6% remain fully protonated. Figure 2 shows the ribose region of the 13C spectrum of 5'-CMP. The cost of preparing perdeuterated NMPs that are uniformly 13C-labeled cannot be significantly reduced by using the less expensive 13C-labeled C1 sodium acetate as the sole carbon source for the culture media. The distribution of 13C label in the nucleosides resulting from either [13C2]C1, C2 or [13C]C2 sodium acetate as the carbon source is shown in Table I. All proton-bound carbons except the ribose C2' and C3' are >80% derived from the acetate C2. Nonetheless, solvent exchange at the acetate C2 leads to substantial levels of 2H enrichment in 90%

and >92%, respectively. However, this method leads to >75% nonspecific cleavage of oligomeric RNA within 24 hr and therefore must be performed using the NMPs. A possible side reaction of the exchange is the proton-catalyzed deamination of cytidine to uridine, t3 Although we have not detected the presence of uridine in NMR spectra or HPLC traces of the cytidine exchange reaction, partial cytidine deamination (to form uridine) is not a serious problem since the exchange is performed on the NMPs, which can be easily separated, and may even be desirable since uridine is approximately 25% less abundant than cytidine in E. coli rRNA. Alternative methods utilizing chemical or enzymatic protocols for the deuteration of nucleic acids have been developedJ 6A7 At the present time, chemical methods for synthesis of multimilligram quantities of 2H,13C,15N-enriched oligonucleotides only lend themselves to selectively labeled preparations. However, enzymatic methods have been used to prepare milligram quantities of RNA oligonucleotides with 13C-labeled and specifically deuterated ribose carbons. 16 These methods utilize enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway to prepare [3, 4, 5, 5-2H4]-phospho-D-ribosyl ot-l-pyrophosphate (PRPP) from uniformly 13C-enriched D-[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6 2H7-]glucose. Protonation at the 1' and 2' carbon positions of ribose is an indirect process that results from the reactions catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. The 5'-NMPs are prepared by enzymatic coupling of the bases (adenine, guanine, and uracil) to PRPP and then phosphorylated to the 5'-NTPs. 5'-CTP is prepared from 5'-UTP using CTP synthetase. The in vitro enzymatic reactions are an efficient route to specifically deuterated ([3', 4', 5', 5"-2H4] and [2', 3', 4', 5', 5"-2H5]) nucleotides with ~87% incorporation of glucose into 5'-NTPs. Preparation of deuterated nucleotides containing 13C- and 15N-enriched bases is necessary for sugar-base and intrabase scalar experiments but is more costly.

The deuterated RNA was synthesized from 5~-NTPs prepared from rRNA isolated from E. coli cultivated using 90~ 2H20 and sodium [2H3lacetate as the deuterium sources. The recovery of magnetization from residues G597, G633, and G652 is dominated by exchange with the solvent and cannot be estimated.

being available to the NH protons. Only the 1H dipolar interactions contribute significantly to the different relaxation rates since deuteration does not influence the chemical exchange processes between NH and solvent protons. Deuteration of the nonexchangeable sites in proteins also decreases the longitudinal relaxation rates of the amide protons by almost 35% relative to those of the protonated protein.18 In the absence of chemical exchange, the line width of a resonance is determined by its transverse relaxation rate. The line widths of the NH proton resonances of the perdeuterated RNA hairpin are 10-15% narrower than the corresponding resonances of the protonated RNA hairpin (~28 and ~33 Hz, respectively). This indicates that the 1H transverse relaxation rates decrease only a small amount in the perdeuterated RNA hairpin and suggests that chemical exchange significantly contributes to the NH proton resonance line width relative to the contribution of proton cross relaxation.

relaxation rates for ribose-protonated and ribose-deuterated molecules. Deuteration slows the longitudinal relaxation of H8 resonances 3.9-fold on average, and the H5 resonances are slowed 2.5-fold (not shown). The relative changes of the H8 and H5 relaxation rates are consistent with the predicted number of proximal dipole relaxation partners. In canonical A-form helices, three to four nonexchangeable protons are located within 3.0 ~ of H8 while only one proton, H6, is within 3.0 ~ of H5. Substitution of these relaxation partners with deuterium reduces the efficiency of the H5 and H8 longitudinal relaxation processes, but because of the presence of fewer proximal protons, H5 relaxation is reduced less. The longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates of the H8 resonances of the ribose-deuterated RNA hairpin also have been measured in 90% IH20. Under this condition, the NH and NH2 positions are protonated and therefore have the potential to contribute to the relaxation of the nonexchangeable base protons. The longitudinal relaxation rates increase an average of 25% in the presence of the NH and NH2 protons, but the transverse relaxation rates are largely unaffected (Fig. 4). The small change of the H8 longitudinal relaxation is not unexpected since the H8-NH/NH2 proton distances are ~ 4 . 5 / ~ in regular A-form RNA helices. Although the H5 relaxation rates are only qualitatively determined, they generally are shorter because of the proximity of NH2 protons in G.C and A.U base pairs. Deuteration also reduces the transverse relaxation rates of the H8 and H5 protons, but the effect is modest compared to the effects on longitudinal relaxation. Figure 4 shows that the H8 transverse relaxation rates of the deuterated RNA molecule are 35% slower on average. The slower rates lead to a 10-25% line-width reduction of the H8 (and H5) resonances of the RNA hairpin. This improvement is not as dramatic as the 50% linewidth reduction that has been measured for the amide resonances of perdeuterated (~80% 2H enrichment) proteins. 18 Although the density of proximal 1H neighbors is different for amide protons and nucleotide base protons, it is also important to note that H5 and H8 are ~3C-bound. The 13C-JH dipolar contribution to 1H transverse relaxation is about twice the 15N-IH dipolar contribution. 19 Although the beteronuclear dipolar interaction limits the effectiveness of deuteration for base 1H linewidth improvement, the 13C nucleus also makes possible the coupling of deuteration and TROSY based experiments.

chemical exchange. An increase in signal-to-noise after deuteration is expected if proton cross relaxation significantly contributes to the line width of the exchangeable protons. In the case of the NH proton resonances, there is only a small increase of the signal-to-noise on deuteration. However, the cytidine NH2 resonances of the deuterated hairpin exhibit a range of sensitivity enhancement, 10-60% signalto-noise increase, over the corresponding resonances of the protonated hairpin. Nonetheless, this sensitivity gain is modest compared to the 250% increase observed for the amide resonances of proteins. 2° Relaxation measurements of the amide proton resonances indicate that transverse relaxation rates can be reduced by 50% when the side-chain positions are deuterated.lS Thus, the sensitivity gains that are expected from decreased transverse relaxation rates are lost to chemical exchange even in regions of regular RNA secondary structure.

13C-1HSpectra
The linewidths of the H8 resonances of the deuterated RNA hairpin are 20-25% narrower than the corresponding resonances of the protonated RNA hairpin (~27 and ~34 Hz, respectively). Similarly, the linewidths of the H5 resonances of the deuterated RNA molecule are about 10-20% narrower than the corresponding resonances of the protonated RNA molecule, ~26 Hz and 32 Hz, respectively. These narrower resonances result in a modest (30-40%) signal-to-noise increase of H8-C8 and H5-C5 cross peaks in the HSQC spectrum of the deuterated RNA molecule. In addition to improving the spectral quality of the base lH resonances, deuteration also provides benefits for the resonances of the sugar ring. Assignment of the ribose spin systems of slowly tumbling RNAs is complicated by rapid transverse relaxation of the ribose 13C nuclei. For these molecules, the HCCH-TOCSY experiment that is employed in the conventional heteronuclear assignment strategy becomes inefficient and leads to incomplete spin system correlations. Selective deuteration of C3'-C5' increases the transverse relaxation times of those nuclei and improves the efficiency of magnetization transfer through the ribose ring, simplifying cross-peak pattern analysis. 21 Figure 5 compares the 2D CT-C(CC)H TOCSY spectra of protonated and 3', 4', 5', 5" deuterated TAR RNA hairpins. In the deuterated molecule, the HI' and H2' resonances of each ribose group yield a set of cross peaks for that entire ~3C ribose spin system. These correlations are incomplete in the spectrum of the protonated molecule.

The fully protonated oligonucleotide does not yield the analogous set of correlations. The selectively deuterated 5'-NTPs used for the T7 RNA polymerasereaction were prepared beginning with [t3C]glucoseand [2H,13C]-glucoseusing enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway.16 [Reproducedwith permission from Dayie et al., J.

Copyright ~3 1998 AcademicPress]. backbone is defined by six torsional angles· Two of these angles, 3 and e, are accessible through measurement of 3ZP-ZH coupling constants. Figure 6 compares the 31p-IH HetCor spectra of ~ 7 5 % deuterated and fully protonated RNA hairpin molecules. The passive couplings have been decreased below 10%, thus enabling observation of many of the often weak P-H5', H5", and P - H 4 ' correlations and permitting measurement of the 3JHp values directly from the spectrum. Although the effective concentration of the deuterated sample is less than one-third that of the fully protonated sample, the deuterium-assisted narrowing of the ribose IH line widths increases the experimental sensitivity of the deuterated RNA relative to the fully protonated RNA. Thus, fractional deuteration can be used to improve the quality of 31p-IH (and IH-1H) correlated spectra and facilitate the extraction of structurally important coupling constant information.

The 5'-NTPs used to synthesize the 2H-enriched sample were prepared from E. coli cultured in 80% 2H20 with sodium [2H3]acetate as the sole carbon source. The samples were ~1.3 mM and spectra A and B were acquired in 13 and 16 hr, respectively.

used to establish secondary structure. In addition, NOEs involving these protons are the source of more global structural information and can provide conformational details on a variety of nucleic acid structure elements including nonstandard base pairs, base triples, and coaxial stacked helices. However, NOE cross peaks between NH and NH2 protons can be weak or may overlap with carbonbound protons, making them difficult to identify and interpret. Figure 7 compares the NH regions of 260 ms mixing time NOESY spectra of the perdeuterated and protonated 45 nucleotide RNA hairpins. NOE cross peaks U644H3-G597H1 and U644H3-A596NH2 that are present in the spectrum of the perdeuterated RNA molecule define the secondary structure in the central portion of the hairpin stem. These cross peaks are too weak to be observed in the spectrum of the protonated molecule. Figure 8 compares one-dimensional vectors along 1 of the 260 ms NOESY spectra for the U603NH resonance, demonstrating the increased sensitivity of the experiment for the deuterated RNA molecule. Both cross peaks and diagonal peaks in the spectrum of the perdeuterated molecule have 2 to 5-fold higher signal-tonoise ratios than the corresponding peaks of the fully protonated RNA molecule. The increased sensitivity results from the reduced number of cross relaxation pathways for the NH protons in the perdeuterated RNA molecule rather than longer lived transverse magnetization of the participating resonances in the deuterated molecule or more rapid NOE cross-peak decay in the protonated molecule.

spectra of (A) the deuterated and (B) the protonated RNA hairpin molecules and (C) the ~ol ~N-selected NOESY spectrum of the protonated RNA molecule. The NH-NH and NH-NH~ regions are divided. The NOE mixing time was 260 ms and the concentration of the RNA molecule was the same for each experiment. The small arrows in A indicate the H2-H3 cross peaks corresponding to the six A.U base pairs. The corresponding cross peaks are considerably more intense in the spectrum of the protonated RNA hairpin. Positions of cross peaks that are absent from the spectrum of the protonated RNA hairpin are indicated by boxes in B. Cross peaks between both NH~ protons of A596 and U644H3 are present in A, but only one of the two cross peaks is present in B. The deuterated 5'-NTPs were prepared from E. coli cultured in 90% 2H20 with sodium [2H3]acetate as the sole carbon source.

The NOESY spectrum of the deuterated RNA hairpin contains cross peaks primarily between the exchangeable protons, although weak cross peaks involving the adenine H2 resonances also can be observed (Fig. 7A). To observe cross peaks only between exchangeable resonances using the fully protonated RNA molecule, an col-selected NOESY experiment must be employed. However, chemical exchange and relaxation during the filter delay periods dramatically reduce the sensitivity of this experiment relative to the NOESY and results in the absence of most cross peaks (Fig. 7C).

retains several cross peaks, but still has fewer than the corresponding NOESY spectrum. Assignment of the NOE cross peaks using only the 2D IH-IH spectrum is difficult, but many of the correlations can be assigned using 2D 15N-1H and 3D 15N-edited NOESY spectra. 6 Although chemical exchange processes involving solvent protons remain active, deuteration of RNA oligonucleotides increases the signal-to-noise of NOE-based spectra and diminishes the effects of spin diffusion. Thus, deuteration permits extraction of additional and more accurate structural constraints. Deuterium enrichment of [13C, 15N]-labeled RNA oligonucleotides can enhance the sensitivity of NOE-based 2D and 3D experiments and simplify crosspeak assignments in the resulting spectra. The conventional sequence specific assignment strategy for the H5 resonances using the H6/H8-HI' region of the NOESY spectrum is complicated by the broad lines resulting from slow molecular tumbling. An alternative strategy employing a 3D ~3C-separated HMQC-NOESY spectrum has been used to assign H5 resonances of the 44 nucleotide RNA hairpin through the NH-H5 cross peaks. 7 The intrabase UH5-UH3 and intrabase pair CH5-GH1 cross peaks primarily arise from spin diffusion through the adenine and cytidine NH2 protons. The signal-to-noise of the same experiment acquired using the protonated RNA hairpin was very poor and did not yield identifiable cross peaks. Because the H5 protons contribute structural information in the form of interbase NOEs, assignment of the H5 resonances is important, but their assignment also is one step toward the sequence-specific assignment of the ribose groups in deuterated molecules. Using triple-resonance experiments, it should be possible to use the H5 (and H8) to link the base and deuterated ribose groups while taking

advantage of the extended transverse relaxation offered by deuteration of the 1' carbon. The proton longitudinal relaxation rates of deuterium enriched molecules can degrade their experimental utility. Deuteration increases the time required for the protons to return to thermal equilibrium, but long recovery delays are impractical in multidimensional NOE-based experiments. However, the exchange of NH and NH2 protons with solvent is sufficiently rapid so that the steady-state ~H magnetization is largely dependent upon the recovery of the solvent protons and not the longitudinal relaxation of the NH and NH2 protons. Thus, the majority of NH and NH2 proton magnetization is replenished during the recovery periods as long as excitation of the solvent is limited. The carbon-bound H5 and H8 within the deuterated environment have longitudinal relaxation times around 1.0 s (Fig. 4). The directly attached 13C nuclei facilitate the relaxation of longitudinal magnetization and permit the use of recovery delays that lead to reasonable experimental acquisition times. Site-Specific D e u t e r a t i o n of 13C-Labeled RNA O l i g o n u c l e o t i d e s The resonance assignment of nucleic acids is primarily accomplished using sequential NOE cross peaks between adjacent base and l' protons and is facilitated by 13C and I~N isotopic enrichment that simplifies the NOESY spectrum and permits the scalar correlation of intraresidue base-l' resonancesfl2,23 Selective deuteration at the pyrimidine C5 using the bisulfite-catalyzed exchange method can be combined with uniform 13C enrichment to yield additional spectral simplification. Figure 9 compares the NOE-based resonance assignment procedure applied to a C5 protonated (5-1H) RNA molecule and the corresponding C5 deuterated (5-2H) molecule. The cross peaks involving H6 are separated according to the chemical shifts of the directly attached C6 nuclei. In the 5-2H molecule, the intensities of the residual H6-H5 cross peaks are significantly weaker than the H6-HI' correlations (Fig. 9). The near absence of an H6-H5 cross peak in the spectrum of the 5-:H molecule permits unambiguous identification of both Cyt-10 H6-HI' correlations (Fig. 9). The interresidue crosspeak between Uri- 12 H6 and Cyt- 13 is not observed because of the conformation of the base. The absence of this interaction is immediately clear in the 5-tH molecule spectrum. In the spectrum of the 5-IH molecule, it is not possible to distinguish whether this cross peak is absent or present but concealed beneath the H6-H5 cross peak. The sensitivity of HMQC-NOESY-HMQC experiments was insufficient to provide comparable information through I'C6/H6 correlations. Thus, 2H substitution of C5 leads to ready identification of the H6-H I'

[ 15] Investigation of Unusual DNA Motifs
By ANH-TU./~NPHAN, MAURICE GUI~RON,and JEAN-LOUIS LEROY
1. I n t r o d u c t i o n As new nucleic acid structures are found, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) continues to be a major player in their study. In a new structure, stoichiometry is unknown, and so is base pairing. Structural symmetries or quasi-symmetries, either static or involving motional averaging, may affect spectral resolution and give rise to ambiguities in the interpretation. Under such conditions, model-independent methods are required or strongly preferred. The results of model-dependent procedures should be checked by independent means. The situation is much the same as with proteins. Multidimensional heteronuclear NMR and isotopic labeling, coupled to molecular refinement by methods such as distance geometry, are the basic tools of the trade. There are also differences such as the restriction to four bases (mainly) compared to 20 amino acids. This enhances the difficulty of spectral assignments. But it also limits the chemistry and the variety of the interactions so that representative structures may be formed even by short oligonucleotides, which are easily synthesized by the phosphoramidite method for DNA and even RNA. This makes modulation of sequence a convenient and useful tool for structural investigations. Another difference is the flexibility of the backbone and its often weak or poorly visible involvement in tertiary interactions: as a result, the NMR study of the backbone is not structurally rewarding. In contrast, the general occurrence of hydrogen-bonded base pairs provides powerful structure indicators, enhancing the value of exchangeable proton spectroscopy. The moderate pK of the imino protons
