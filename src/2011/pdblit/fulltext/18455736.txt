Abstract Chloroplast fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is activated by reduction of a regulatory disulfide through thioredoxin f (Trx f). In the course of this reduction a transient mixed disulfide is formed linking covalently Trx f with FBPase, which possesses three Cys on a loop structure, two of them forming the redox-active disulfide bridge. The goal of this study was to identify the Cys involved in the transient mixed disulfide. To stabilize this reaction intermediate, mutant proteins with modified active sites were used. We identified Cys-155 of the FBPase as the one engaged in the formation of the mixed disulfide intermediate with Cys-46 of Trx f. ß 2001 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Introduction In chloroplasts several enzymes, in particular enzymes involved in CO2 assimilation like fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), are known to be light-regulated via thioredoxins [1]. Thioredoxins are small ubiquitous proteins with the conserved active site sequence -Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys- whose disul¢de bridge gets reduced, in chloroplasts, by electrons from photosystem I via ferredoxin and ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase. Chloroplasts contain two types of thioredoxins, the m- and the f-type. Thioredoxin f (Trx f) is distinct from the other chloroplast thioredoxin by the presence of a third conserved cysteine of unknown function [2,3]. Reduced Trx f modulates the activity of the light-regulated enzymes by reducing their regulatory disul¢de. The crystallographic structure of Trx f has recently been solved [4]. It con¢rms that the active site cysteine closer to the N-terminus (Cys-46), which had been shown to be the attacking nucleophile [5], is surfaceexposed, whereas the second one, Cys-49, is buried in the protein. The third cysteine, Cys-73, is also surface-exposed. The regulatory disul¢des of several thioredoxin-dependent

enzymes have been located. Phosphoribulokinase was the ¢rst where the molecular pathway for the regulation by Trx f has been described [6]. Another well studied enzyme is the NADPdependent malate dehydrogenase, where activation by thioredoxin implies the reduction of at least two disul¢de bonds [7,8]. Chloroplastic FBPase is a tetrameric enzyme and resembles the cytosolic counterpart except for the presence, in the chloroplast enzyme, of an insertion of about 20 amino acids containing three conserved cysteines. In the spinach enzyme these cysteines, Cys-155, Cys-174 and Cys-179, are located on a regulatory loop structure [9] and based on early sequencing results the regulatory disul¢de was proposed between Cys-174 and Cys-179 [10]. Later site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated the central role of Cys-153 in pea [11,12] and Cys-157 in rapeseed [13] FBPase for regulation. The recently published crystallographic structure of oxidized pea enzyme reveals a disul¢de bridge between Cys-153 and Cys-173 [14], corresponding to Cys-155 and Cys-174 in spinach where no such data are available. The model suggests that the sulfur atom of Cys-174 is closer to the surface than the one of Cys153. Disul¢de reduction by reduced thioredoxins proceeds via the formation of a transition state heterodisul¢de between the two reactants [15]. With mutants, where the non-accessible cysteine of one or both participating reactants has been replaced, it is possible to obtain covalently linked, stable heterodimers [6,16]. These provide information on the accessibility of the individual cysteine residues and on the identity of the Cys participating in the intermolecular mixed disul¢de. To obtain such information for the reduction of spinach chloroplast FBPase by homologous Trx f we replaced on both proteins the cysteine residues potentially involved. With these mutants we obtained evidence that a stable mixed disul¢de intermediate is formed between Cys-155 of FBPase and Cys46 of Trx f. 2. Materials and methods
The cloning of spinach FBPase and the plasmids used for mutagenesis of FBPase (pET 3d-FBPase) and Trx f (pET 3d-TFDel and TFDelC73S) have been described previously [17]. All sequences and mutations were checked by automatic sequencing using a T7 primer and the sequencing kit from Amersham-Pharmacia on a MWG LICOR sequencer. Expression of recombinant proteins was done in the E. coli strain BL21 DE3 pLysS grown in Luria broth containing 100 Wg/ml ampicillin and 34 Wg/ml chloramphenicol at 37³C. When the culture reached an OD600 nm of 0.8, expression was induced by adding isopropyl-L-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a ¢nal concentration of 0.5 mM.

Extraction and puri¢cation of Trx f included an osmotic shock [18,19], where cells were resuspended in sucrose containing bu¡er (50 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (Mes)-NaOH pH 6.1, 2.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 20% sucrose) and, after 10 min under low agitation, were sedimented by centrifugation (5000Ug, 10 min, 4³C). This treatment was repeated with bu¡er containing no sucrose (50 mM Mes-NaOH pH 6.1, 2.5 mM EDTA and 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-MET)). After centrifugation (10 000Ug, 10 min, 4³C) the supernatant containing Trx f was applied on an SPSepharose column (5U5.5 cm, Amersham-Pharmacia) equilibrated in 50 mM malonate^Cl pH 6.0, 14 mM 2-MET. After elution with a 2 l gradient of 0^200 mM NaCl in this bu¡er the Trx f fractions were concentrated on a YM10 membrane (Amicon) and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.6U95 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Mes-NaOH pH 6.1, 50 mM NaCl and 14 mM 2-MET. Trx f was ¢nally concentrated on a YM10 membrane and dia¢ltrated with 50 mM Mes-NaOH pH 6.1, 14 mM 2-MET. For the extraction of recombinant FBPase the bacteria were resuspended in 30 mM Tris^Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. After freezing and thawing to disrupt cell membranes 25 U/10 ml of benzonase (Merck) was added to digest nucleic acids. The resulting solution was clari¢ed (48 000Ug, 15 min, 4³C) and its pH lowered with formic acid to 5.2. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation and the pH of the supernatant adjusted to 5.5 with 0.1 M NaOH. The protein extract was loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (5U11.5 cm, AmershamPharmacia) equilibrated in 50 mM Na-acetate pH 5.5 and eluted with a 2 l gradient of 0^1 M NaCl in bu¡er. Active fractions were combined and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (90% saturation). The pellets, redissolved in 20 ml of 50 mM Na-acetate pH

59 5.5, were chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column (4U98 cm). The peak containing the enzyme was collected and the FBPase concentrated and dia¢ltrated on a XM50 membrane (Amicon) with 50 mM Na-acetate pH 5.5. If needed a ¢nal clean up was accomplished on a 1.5U14.5 cm hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad, Ceramic MacroPrep, 40 Wm) with a 1 l gradient of 20^250 mM K-phosphate bu¡er pH 7.0. FBPase fractions were concentrated and dia¢ltrated as before and stored frozen. The concentration of proteins was calculated based on their absorbance at 280 nm. For recombinant FBPase we determined an extinction coe¤cient of O280 nm = 144 570 M31 cm31 and for Trx f we used O280 nm = 14 230 M31 cm31 [20]. FBPase and Trx f were mixed in a ratio of 1:4 (FBPase:Trx f) in 50 mM TEA^Cl pH 7.0 and incubated for 30 min at 25³C. When oxidant was added, it was at a ¢nal concentration of 3 mM for cupric ions (CuSO4 ) or 10 mM for diamide (N,N,NP,NP-tetramethylazodicarboxamide) [21]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS^ PAGE) was carried out as described by Laemmli [22] using a miniPROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue.

3. Results and discussion To obtain stable protein^protein mixed disul¢de intermediates between Trx f and FBPase we replaced on both proteins cysteines potentially involved in intermolecular disul¢des by serines. After incubation of all possible combinations of the mutant proteins under oxidizing conditions the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS^PAGE under non-reducing conditions. In Trx f, which contains three strictly conserved cysteines, two are accessible and capable of forming disul¢de bonds. Cys-46, the accessible cysteine of the active site, has been shown to be the primary nucleophile in the activation of FBPase [5] and Cys-73, which is close to the active site [4], was found to be able to form disul¢de bonds [2]. To distinguish between the two cysteines and detect possible interactions with Cys-73 we produced two Trx f mutants. We replaced in both Cys-49 leaving in the ¢rst mutant two accessible cysteinyl residues, Cys-46 and Cys-73, while in a second mutant we also replaced Cys-73. In the spinach FBPase all three cysteines of the regulatory loop, Cys-155, Cys-174 and Cys-179, were individually replaced. In addition we constructed the double mutants C155/174S, C155/179S and C174/179S. Wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins were expressed and puri¢ed to homogeneity. Samples of FBPase WT or mutant (C155S, C174S, C179S, C155/174S, C155/179S, C174/179S) were mixed and incubated at a ratio of 1:4 with samples of WT Trx f, mutant C49S or double mutant C49/73S in air-saturated bu¡er at pH 7.0. Fig. 1A,B shows the analyses of these mixtures by SDS^PAGE where we observe essentially three bands corresponding to Trx f (12.5 kDa), FBPase monomer (44 kDa) and a covalently linked complex of Trx f with FBPase monomer (V60 kDa). Mixtures containing WT Trx f (Fig. 1, lanes a) form no heterodimeric complex since in oxidized thioredoxin its active site cysteines are linked by the internal disul¢de bond. Furthermore, the absence of a heterodimer indicates that the third cysteine, Cys-73, does not form a disul¢de bond with FBPase. Similarly, in virtually all reaction mixtures containing FBPase mutants lacking Cys-155 there is no complex formation. However, the 60 kDa heterodimer band clearly appears when either Cys-174 or Cys-179, or both are replaced by serine. WT FBPase forms also a small amount of heterodimer with Trx f mutants.

The most relevant observation is that the formation of heterodimers is linked to the presence of Cys-155 indicating that this residue is clearly part of the disul¢de bridge between FBPase and Trx f, although the pea enzyme structure positions the sulfur atom corresponding to Cys-174 closer to the surface [14]. The fact that Cys-155 and not Cys-174 is attacked by Cys-46 of Trx f suggests that as a result of the interaction between FBPase and Trx f, which is of electrostatic nature [23], there is some change in the conformation of the £exible regulatory loop favoring Cys-155 as the target residue. The weak band of heterodimer seen with Trx f C49S and FBPase C155S is probably due to an artefactual disul¢de bridge with either Cys-174 or Cys-179 since it is absent from the incubations with the double mutants C155/174S and C155/ 179S. It could also be formed with Cys-73 of Trx f since it is not seen with Trx f mutant C73S. Mutation of Cys-155 might render the residues Cys-174 and Cys-179 more accessible due to increased £exibility of the loop in absence of the regulatory disul¢de [14]. Surprisingly, the analyses of reaction mixtures containing the FBPase mutant Cys-174 or Cys-179 produce essentially identical patterns for both, favoring heterodimer formation although Cys-179 is, based on the pea enzyme structure, not implicated in a regulatory disul¢de bridge. The C179S mutation probably induces some structural change in the regulatory loop enhancing the accessibility of Cys-155 for Trx f. However, the large amounts of complex formed between FBPase C174S and both thioredoxin mutants let us conclude that in both proteins only these active site Cys are remaining,

which are part of the intermolecular bond, i.e. Cys-155 in FBPase and Cys-46 in Trx f [5] (Table 1). Complex formation happened very rapidly. Within minutes after mixing the proteins the complexes could be demonstrated and no signi¢cant further increase in their amounts was detected even after overnight incubation, which we consider as an indication for the speci¢city of the interaction. In order to further enhance formation of covalent complexes we tested the addition of oxidants during incubation. Fig. 2 shows results obtained with diamide. The amount of heterodimer formed between WT FBPase and Trx f mutants increases signi¢cantly reaching almost the level seen with FBPase C179S, while FBPase C174S is almost completely in the intermediate complex form. By increasing the ratio of thioredoxin C49S/FBPase C174S it has not been possible to completely saturate the tetrameric FBPase with Trx f (data not shown). Chromatographic separation of such reaction mixtures yielded four species of heterodimeric complexes containing variable numbers of thioredoxins linked. On the other hand addition of oxidant produced detectable levels of thioredoxin homodimers implicating Cys-73 in the WT, Cys-46 and/or Cys-73 in the C49S mutant and Cys-46 in the C49/ 73S double mutant. Addition of cupric ions (Cu2 ) as oxidant [6] resulted in essentially the same patterns, but with many additional minor bands, which seem to be due to modi¢cations of the FBPase since they are also observed after incubation of FBPase alone. The dimerizations obtained with diamide are entirely reversible. The covalently linked heterodimers were easily separated by reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 3), whereas monothiols like glutathione or 2-MET were much less e¤cient (data not shown). In conclusion, we have obtained evidence for the formation of covalent heterodimers between spinach chloroplast FBPase and Trx f active site mutant C49S. We identi¢ed Cys-155 of FBPase as the cysteinyl residue, which forms the protein^protein mixed disul¢de bond with the primary nucleophile Cys-46 of Trx f during the reduction/activation process.
