RIKEN Systems and Structural Biology Center, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan Received 21 October 2008; accepted 26 November 2008 Available online 11 December 2008 Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) recently found in some methanogenic archaea and bacteria, recognizes an unusually large lysine derivative, L-pyrrolysine, as the substrate, and attaches it to the cognate tRNA (tRNAPyl). The PylRS­tRNAPyl pair interacts with none of the endogenous aaRS­tRNA pairs in Escherichia coli, and thus can be used as a novel aaRS­tRNA pair for genetic code expansion. The crystal structures of the Methanosarcina mazei PylRS revealed that it has a unique, large pocket for amino acid binding, and the wild type M. mazei PylRS recognizes the natural lysine derivative as well as many lysine analogs, including N -(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-lysine (Boc-lysine), with diverse side chain sizes and structures. Moreover, the PylRS only loosely recognizes the -amino group of the substrate, whereas most aaRSs, including the structurally and genetically related phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS), strictly recognize the main chain groups of the substrate. We report here that wild type PylRS can recognize substrates with a variety of main-chain -groups: -hydroxyacid, non--amino-carboxylic acid, N-methyl-amino acid, and D-amino acid, each with the same side chain as that of Boc-lysine. In contrast, PheRS recognizes none of these amino acid analogs. By expressing the wild type PylRS and its cognate tRNAPyl in E. coli in the presence of the -hydroxyacid analog of Boc-lysine (BocLysOH), the amber codon (UAG) was recoded successfully as Boc-LysOH, and thus an ester bond was site-specifically incorporated into a protein molecule. This PylRS­tRNAPyl pair is expected to expand the backbone diversity of protein molecules produced by both in vivo and in vitro ribosomal translation.

1353 hexanoic acid (Boc-LysOH; Fig. 1). We report that Boc-LysOH as well as Boc-lysine was successfully incorporated into a protein in a site-specific manner in E. coli. Loose recognition of the -amino moiety by PylRS As shown in Fig. 2a, the -amino group of Lpyrrolysine is loosely recognized in the crystal structure of the M. mazei PylRS L-pyrrolysine AMPPNP complex.12 The -amino group only hydrogen bonds to a water molecule, which is trapped by the side chain of Asn346 and hydrogen bonded to the main chain amino groups of Leu301 and Ala302. Although the side chains of Met300 and Ala302, which are completely conserved among the PylRSs, are close to the -amino group of the bound L-pyrrolysine, they are too distant from each other to form van der Waals contacts. In the PylRS L-pyrrolysyl adenylate (PylAMP) structure reported by Kavran et al., 11 Tyr384, on the loop between 7 and 8 of the C-terminal catalytic fragment, approaches the -amino group of the pyrrolysyl moiety and forms a hydrogen bond. However, Tyr384 is distant from the substrate in the apo-PylRS structure,12 and is disordered in the cases of the Cyc-AMP-11 and Boc-lysine-bound PylRS structures,15 as in the PylRS L-pyrrolysine complex. Moreover, L-pyrrolysine is recognized, at least in vitro, and Boc-lysine is recognized both in vivo and in vitro, by the PylRS mutant, which has a Phe substitution for Tyr384.15 These findings suggest that the hydrogen bond between the -amino group of the substrate and Tyr384 is flexibly formed, and not essential for the catalytic activity of PylRS. Therefore, the -amino group of the substrate is only indirectly recognized by PylRS, via the hydrogen bond network with a water molecule trapped by the polypeptide. In contrast, the structural relative of PylRS, PheRS, strictly recognizes the -amino group of its substrate, L -phenylalanine. In the Thermus thermophilus PheRS L-phenylalanine structure,16 the -amino group of the L-phenylalanine hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Ser180, Gln219, and Glu220, and interacts with His178 through van der Waals contacts (Fig. 2b). His178 and Ser180 correspond to the Thr and Glu residues, respectively, of the conserved T-X-E motif for the -amino-group recognition by the class II aaRSs,17 except for threonyl-tRNA synthetase, which recognizes its substrate by a coordinated zinc ion in addition to the protein residues and a proteintrapped water molecule.18 The novel PheRS-related class-IIc aaRS, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS), which aminoacylates the cysteine tRNA (tRNACys ) with O-phospho-L-serine for cysteine biosynthesis,19 also strictly recognizes the -amino group of its substrate. The crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus SepRS tRNACys O-phosphoL-serine complex20 revealed that the two residues of the T-X-E motif, His186 and Thr188, correspond to His178 and Ser180 of the T. thermophilus PheRS, respectively, and that Thr188 recognizes the -amino

In living cells, proteins are synthesized by the translation of genetic information according to the genetic code, which assigns the 20 standard amino acids to the 61 sense codons. The precise codon-toamino acid assignment in the genetic code is achieved by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), corresponding to their respective amino acids. These enzymes strictly recognize both the side chain and main chain groups of their specific amino acids as the substrates, activate them with ATP, and produce the aminoacyl adenylate intermediates. The aminoacyl moieties are then transferred to their cognate tRNA molecules.1 The aaRSs are divided into two classes, I and II, according to the signature motifs, and each class is further divided into three subclasses.2 In many species across the three kingdoms of life, selenocysteine is synthesized in the form of selenocysteinyl-tRNA from seryl-tRNA, and is incorporated into specific proteins in response to the opal (UGA) codon, as the 21st amino acid.3,4 Recently, a novel amino acid, L-pyrrolysine, was found as the 22nd amino acid, incorporated into the methylamine methyltransferases in the methanogenic archaea Methanosarcinae.5,6 L-Pyrrolysine is a large lysine derivative with a methyl-pyrroline ring at the N group.6,7 A novel class-II aaRS, pyrrolysyltRNA synthetase (PylRS) attaches this unique amino acid directly to the specific amber (UAG) suppressor tRNA (tRNAPyl ).5,8,9 The PylRS­tRNAPyl pair is "orthogonal" to the aaRS­tRNA systems from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and mammalian cells; the expressed PylRS and tRNAPyl molecules do not interact with the endogenous tRNA and aaRS molecules, respectively, and the substrates for PylRS can be incorporated specifically into proteins in response to amber codons in these organisms.8,10 The crystal structures of the Methanosarcina mazei PylRS catalytic C-terminal fragment and its complexes with substrates were determined,11,12 revealing that the overall structure is similar to that of the class-IIc phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS).13 These structures showed that PylRS has an unusually large substrate binding pocket for L-pyrrolysine. Therefore, the enzyme has extraordinarily broad specificity for the side chain structures of amino acids; it efficiently accommodates other nonnatural lysine derivatives, such as N-D-prolyl-Llysine, N-cyclopentyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (Cyc),14 and N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl (t-Boc))-L-lysine (Boclysine; Fig. 1).15 These amino acids thus represent alternative substrates for L-pyrrolysine, and they have been used for the expansion of the genetic code in E. coli, yeast, and mammalian cells expressing the orthogonal PylRS tRNAPyl genes.10,14,15 The structures of the substrate-binding pocket of PylRS suggest that PylRS may also be capable of recognizing a broad spectrum of main chain structures as well as various side chain structures. We have analyzed the activity of the M. mazei PylRS for several non--amino derivatives of Boc-lysine. As a result, we found catalytic tolerance for a broad range of non--amino Boc-lysine analogs, including an -hydroxyacid, N-t-Boc-L-6-amino-2-hydroxy-

Boc-Ahx was purchased from Fluka. Boc-LysOH was synthesized as described,49 and the purity was assessed by silica gel thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry by Shinsei Chemical Co., Ltd. NMe-Boc-lysine (NMe-Boc-Lys) was produced from N-9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl(Fmoc-) NMe-t-Boc-lysine (Bachem). N-Fmoc-NMe-t-Boc-lysine (35 mol) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of dioxane, and was deblocked by adding 0.5 ml of piperidine for 2 h at room temperature. The deblocked NMe-Boc-lysine was separated as a precipitate, which was centrifuged, washed twice with 10 ml of diethylether, and finally dried in a vacuum evaporator. The purity of the deblocked product was monitored by thin-layer chromatography.

group by a hydrogen bond (Fig. 2c). The side chain oxygen atom of Asn325 is close enough (b3.2 Å) to hydrogen bond to the -amino group, and the hydroxy groups of Tyr273 and Tyr274 also have the potential to hydrogen bond to the -amino group of O-phospho-L-serine. In addition, the side chain phosphate group of the O-phospho-L-serine interacts electrostatically with the main chain -amino group. Thus, the canonical class-II aaRSs strictly recognize the -amino groups of their cognate amino acids. The

class I aaRSs also precisely recognize the -amino groups of their substrates in different manners.17 Recognition of non--amino derivatives by PylRS Given the uniquely loose -amino-group recognition by the PylRS, we considered that it could esterify other non--amino derivatives of its -amino substrates to tRNAPyl. Thus, we analyzed the acylation

Fig. 3. Acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of Boc-lysine-analog recognition by the wild type M. mazei PylRS. The wild type PylRS proteins were over-expressed in E. coli, and were purified as described.12 The tRNAPyl transcripts were prepared as described.12 Aminoacylation reactions were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C in 100 mM Hepes-K buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mM magnesium chloride, 4 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 10 M tRNAPyl, 3 M wild type full-length PylRS, and 2 mM Boc-lysine analogs. The acylated tRNA molecules were separated by acid-urea PAGE (7% polyacrylamide gel) with sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8), and the reactions were stopped by the addition of phenol saturated with citrate buffer (pH 4.3). The gel was stained with 0.1% (w/v) toluidine blue.

activity for the non--amino derivatives of Boc-lysine, because Boc-lysine and L-pyrrolysine are recognized by PylRS in a similar manner. Moreover, Boc-lysine and its derivatives are either commercially available or easily synthesized. N  -t-Boc-D-lysine (D-Boclysine), N-t-Boc-6-amino-2-hydroxy-L-hexanoic acid (Boc-LysOH), N-t-Boc-6-aminohexanoic acid (BocAhx), and N-methyl-N-t-Boc-L-lysine (NMe-Boclysine) were chosen as the derivatives of Boc-lysine (Fig. 1). They were reacted with 10 M tRNAPyl at final concentrations of 2 mM in the presence/absence of the wild type PylRS. As shown in Fig. 3, all of these Boc-lysine analogs were attached to the tRNAPyl by the PylRS. The wild type PylRS efficiently ligated tRNAPyl with Boc-LysOH, which is almost the same size as Boc-lysine, while it lacks the positive charge at the  position (Fig. 3, lane 7). Interestingly, Boc-Ahx was also recognized efficiently (Fig. 3, lane 9). Therefore, the recognition of the -group of the substrates is dispensable for the PylRS catalytic reaction. The yields of the acylated-tRNAs with these compounds were almost 100%, and were higher than that with Boc-lysine (Fig. 3, lane 3), probably because -hydroxyacyl- and non--amino-carboxyltRNAs are chemically more stable than an aminoacyl-tRNA.21 Moreover, the Boc-lysine with an additional -methyl, NMe-Boc-lysine, and the diastereomer of Boc-lysine, D-Boc-lysine, were also recognized by the wild type enzyme (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 11), but the enzymatic activities with them are lower than that with Boc-lysine, probably because of the steric clashes between PylRS and the substrates. Nevertheless, PylRS has broad tolerance for the substituted analogs of primary -amino substrates. In contrast, PheRS strictly recognizes the -amino group of the substrates.22 PheRS cannot activate the -hydroxy or non--amino carboxylic acid derivatives of L-phenylalanine with ATP. Interestingly, most aaRSs discriminate the -hydroxy analogs from their substrates; Szostak and co-workers reported that only methionyl-tRNA synthetase, among the 16 aaRSs tested, recognized the -hydroxyacid analog of methionine in an in vitro translation system.23 Since living cells contain many -hydroxyacids (e.g., lactic acid, malic acid) as the metabolites, aaRSs must avoid misacylations of tRNA with these compounds. Although the biogenic and metabolic pathways of L-pyrrolysine are unclear, the -hydroxyacid of Lpyrrolysine is not thought to be present in methanogenic organisms, and thus the PylRS has not

developed a strict discrimination mechanism against the -hydroxyacids. On the other hand, N-methyl amino acids and D-amino acids are recognized by some aaRSs; AspRS and HisRS recognize N-methylaspartic acid and N-methyl-histidine, respectively,23 and D-tyrosine, D-tryptophan, D-aspartic acid, Dhistidine, and D-lysine can be attached to tRNA molecules by their cognate aaRS molecules.24 In vivo incorporation of an -hydroxyacid by the PylRS·tRNAPyl pair in E. coli Ribosomal polymerization of an -hydroxyacid was reported in the 1970s.25 The tRNA chemically ligated with an -hydroxyacid can be recognized by EF-Tu,26 and delivered to the ribosome, and then the -hydroxyacid molecules are polymerized, as in the case of -amino acids. Such chemically -hydroxyacylated tRNA molecules have been used for the production of proteins containing a site-specific ester bond in vitro27­29 and in vivo (Xenopus oocyte).30 Our discovery of the PylRS activity for Boc-LysOH suggested that the site-specific incorporation of BocLysOH in E. coli cells could be accomplished by expressing the wild type PylRS tRNAPyl in vivo. Therefore, we analyzed the in vivo incorporation of Boc-LysOH. The M. mazei PylRS and tRNAPyl were expressed in E. coli cells, and the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) gene, in which the open reading frame is interrupted with an amber codon at residue 109 (Fig. 4a), was expressed under the control of the T7 promoter. In the absence of the non-natural substrate in M9GMML (see the legend to Fig. 4b) or LB medium, no full-length GST was produced (Fig. 4b, lane 5), because of the translational termination at the internal stop codon. This indicates that the PylRS­tRNAPyl pair is actually orthogonal to the E. coli aaRS­tRNA pairs,8 and that the wild type PylRS recognizes none of the endogenous amino acids. In the presence of 1 mM Boc-lysine, the full-length GST was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography, as described15 (Fig. 4b, lane 3). As expected, the fulllength product was readily detected, and it was present also when 1-mM Boc-LysOH, instead of Boclysine, was incorporated in the culture medium (Fig. 4b, lane 1). The 29 kDa full-length GST was sitespecifically cleaved to the N-terminal 12 kDa and Cterminal 17 kDa fragments by alkaline hydrolysis under mild conditions (25 °C, 2 h), since the ester

1357 4e). These results indicate that Boc-LysOH is assimilated by the E. coli cells and incorporated translationally into proteins in response to the amber codon within their genes, in the presence of the PylRS­tRNAPyl pair. The yield of the Boc-LysOH-containing protein was 0.9 mg/l culture, which is about one-tenth of that of the Boc-lysine-containing protein. Although a higher copy number of the tRNA Pyl gene increased the yield of amber-suppressed GST with Boc-lysine generated by PylRS in E. coli, that with Boc-LysOH was hardly affected (data not shown). This implies that either the Boc-LysOHacylated tRNA binding of EF-Tu or the ester-bond formation by the ribosome is the rate-limiting reaction in this system.31,32 PylRS for site-specific backbone mutagenesis To date, to expand the variety of protein residue mutations, the site-specific incorporation of nonnatural amino acids in living cells has been achieved by the genetic code expansion of the cells, using altered aaRS­tRNA pairs that are orthogonal to the

bonds formed by the polymerization of an hydroxyacid are more alkali-labile than the amide bonds (Fig. 4b, lane 2). Each fragment was identified also by Western blotting with the antibodies against their respective tags (N-terminal T7 tag and Cterminal His6 tag; Fig. 4b). Precise molecular masses for these GST polypeptides with mutations at residue 109 were obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For the Boc-LysOH-incorporated GST incubated without the alkaline reagent, one peak, representing the single ionized peptide, was obtained, corresponding to the full-length GST lacking the Nterminal methionine residue (theoretical m/z = 29156; Fig. 4d). After alkaline hydrolysis, two peaks, corresponding to the N-terminal (theoretical m/z = 12288) and C-terminal (theoretical m/z = 16886) fragments, were clearly detected, as shown in Fig. 4c. In contrast, there was no mass change with/without treatment with alkali for the Boc-lysine-incorporated GST (Fig. 4d). Such site-specific alkaline cleavage of the amber-suppressed GST was detected also when another GST gene, with codon 25 replaced by an amber codon, was over-expressed in E. coli cells in the presence of Boc-LysOH, PylRS, and tRNAPyl (Fig.

Left: Before alkaline treatment; Right: after alkaline treatment. The Schistosoma japonicum GST (GenBank accession no. AAB59203) (2­218) gene was amplified from the pGEX vector (GE Healthcare) by PCR, and includes an N-terminal tag with the T7 tag sequence (MASMTGGQQMGRDPGANSGVTKNSY; T7 tag is underlined) and a C-terminal linker (Ser-Asp). The PCR fragment was introduced into the NdeI-XhoI sites of pET21b for the expression of the protein with a C-terminal His6 tag (LEHHHHHH). Codon 109, which corresponds to Cys84 in the S. japonicum GST, of the introduced GST on the pET plasmid was then mutated to the amber codon (UAG) by the QuikChange method (Stratagene), and this tagged GST mutant gene was designated GST(109Amber). This Cys84 residue was chosen from the surface residues in the GST structure (PDB ID 1UA5), and its substitution with non-natural residues should not affect either the protein folding or glutathione binding activity. The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the constructed plasmids and the pTK2-1 based plasmids for the stable expression of wild type M. mazei PylRS and tRNAPyl.15 The cells were fermented overnight in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 g/ml) and kanamycin (50 g/ml), and then were inoculated into the three types of M9 medium, containing 1% (v/v) glycerol and 0.3 mM Lleucine (M9GMML) supplemented with ampicillin (100 g/ml), kanamycin (50 g/ml), and either 1 mM Boc-lysine, BocLysOH, or no non-natural substrate, respectively. Each culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C until the optical absorbance was 0.3, and then IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were harvested, and suspended in PBS, sonicated on ice, and centrifuged. The recombinant full-length GST molecules were purified from the supernatants by Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) affinity column chromatography, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The purified proteins were concentrated to 0.1­1.7 mg/ml with an Amicon Ultra 4 filter (Millipore). The concentrations of the proteins were adjusted to 0.1 mg/ml, and then were left at 25 °C for 2 h after the addition of an equal volume of water (no treatment with alkali) or NH4OH (mild treatment with alkali). The ammonia was removed from the reacted solutions by vacuum evaporation. Aliquots of the solutions were stored at -80 °C for mass spectrometry. Other aliquots were mixed with NuPAGE sample buffer, but were not subjected to heat denaturation, to avoid hydrolysis of the ester bond in the recombinant GST molecules. These samples were fractionated by PAGE on two 4%­12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels with Mes running buffer. One gel was stained with SimplyBlue Safe Stain, and the other was used for Western blotting with the anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen) and the antipenta His antibody (Qiagen). For mass spectrometry, the peptides were concentrated and purified from the stored samples with a ZipTip C18 column (Millipore), and then their MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured with a VoyagerDE STR spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). e, SDS-PAGE analysis of intact or alkali-cleaved, purified GST expressed from GST(25Amber) with PylRS·tRNAPyl in E. coli cells, in the presence of 1 mM Boc-lysine or Boc-LysOH, or in the absence of non-natural substrates. Codon 25 of the open reading frame of the GST with the T7 and His6 tags constructed above was mutated to the amber codon. This mutant gene was designated as GST(25Amber) and expressed with wild type PylRS and tRNAPyl in the presence of Boc-lysine/Boc-LysOH in E. coli, and full-length GST was purified, as described above. The purified proteins were concentrated and treated with alkali, as described above. The products were fractionated by conventional SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide gel) method, and were stained with SimplyBlue Safe Stain.

1358 endogenous aaRS­tRNA pairs.33­38 On the other hand, a method for the main chain mutagenesis of proteins was also desired, because it was impossible to change the backbone structures of proteins with the canonical amino acids. The site-specific amideto-ester substitution has been used for the main chain mutagenesis of proteins to analyze the contributions of the main chain hydrogen bonds to protein folding, catalysis, and molecular recognition.28­30,39 The alkali-labile ester bond can also be used for the enzyme-free cleavage of proteins or peptides, to remove tags or for activation. As described above, the evolutionally novel aaRS, PylRS, tolerates various non--amino substrates. One of these, Boc-LysOH, is genetically encoded successfully by introducing the PylRS­ tRNAPyl pair into E. coli. Previous reports state that an N-methylated amino acid can be polymerized by the ribosome;27 however, we could not achieve the site-specific introduction of NMe-Boc-lysine in E. coli cells with this aaRS­tRNA pair, probably because the wild type PylRS lacks sufficient activity for NMe-Boc-lysine (Fig. 3). The genetic engineering of PylRS would increase the enzyme activity for non--amino substrates. The other Boc-lysine analogs we tested will not be incorporated into proteins by the natural translation system, which also does not incorporate D -amino acids into proteins. Recently, an altered ribosome, which recognizes Damino acids as well as L -amino acids, was developed.40,41 Such efforts to engineer ribosome genes will expand the variety of protein backbones by genetic code expansion. The engineering of the 50 S ribosome should facilitate the polymerization of the -hydroxyacids. Conversely, the in vivo encoding of -hydroxyacids will facilitate the genetic selection of such mutant ribosomal genes. Recently, Schultz and co-workers reported the incorporation of the -hydroxyacid analog of L-tyrosine site-specifically into proteins, with an altered archaeal Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyltRNA synthetase (TyrRS) and its cognate tRNA in engineered E. coli, using proteins with the sitespecific ester bond.42 Their altered aaRS specifically recognizes the -hydroxyacid, whereas the wild type PylRS recognizes both the Boc-lysine and BocLysOH in a non-discriminating manner. On the other hand, Boc-lysine and the other substrates of PylRS do not exist in E. coli cells,8 and thus BocLysOH is selectively incorporated into the proteins in response to the amber codon within their genes. Moreover, the wild type PylRS recognizes the wild type amber suppressor tRNA, tRNAPyl, and the opal (UGA) suppressor mutant of the tRNAPyl (tRNAPylUGA),43 whereas the M. jannaschii TyrRS recognizes the amber suppressor tRNA (tRNATyrUAG) derived from its cognate tRNA.44 The PylRS­ tRNAPylUGA pair is orthogonal to the E. coli aaRS­ tRNA pairs, and causes efficient opal suppression in E. coli.43 Therefore, the M. jannaschii TyrRS­ tRNATyrUAG pair and the PylRS­ tRNAPylUGA pair can be used for the simultaneous incorporation of non-natural components into proteins corresponding

Pyrrolysyl-tRNA Synthetase

to the two different nonsense codons. Since the PylRS­tRNAPyl pair is orthogonal to the aaRS­ tRNA systems from eukaryal cells (yeast and mammalian cells) as well as from bacterial cells,10 the PylRS­tRNAPyl pair will be useful for the incorporation of the ester bond into the proteins in eukaryal cells as well as in E. coli. Our PylRS tRNAPyl suppression system can be used for the in vitro synthesis of peptides with nonnatural backbones. Recently, in vitro translation systems have been customized for the production of nonribosomal peptides by reprogramming the genetic code.45­47 In these reports, the precharged tRNA molecules, which were either enzymatically (with natural aaRSs or the artificially evolved ribozyme, flexizyme48) or chemically acylated, were added to a customized, highly purified translation system. PylRS and its mutants can be used for alternative catalysis for tRNA acylation, and will contribute to the efficient one-pot production of nonribosomal peptides.
