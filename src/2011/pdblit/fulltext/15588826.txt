Abstract Two metal ion binding sites are conserved in metalloL-lactamase from Aeromonas hydrophila. The ligands of a first zinc ion bound with picomolar dissociation constant were identified by EXAFS spectroscopy as one Cys, two His and one additional N/O donor. Sulfur-to-metal charge transfer bands are observed for all mono- and di-metal species substituted with Cu(II) or Co(II) due to ligation of the single conserved cysteine residue. Binding of a second metal ion results in non-competitive inhibition which might be explained by an alternative kinetic mechanism. A possible partition of metal ions between the two binding sites is discussed. z 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction L-Lactamases are extracellular or periplasmic enzymes synthesized by bacteria. The producing strains become resistant to L-lactam antibiotics. Class B L-lactamases [1,2] are metalloproteins which require bivalent transition-metal ions for activity, and Zn2 appears to be the metal present in the naturally occurring proteins. The number of known class B L-lactamase producers has signi¢cantly increased during the last decade. However, only a few enzymes of this group have been studied in detail. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of the enzymes from Bacillus cereus 569/H/9, Bacteroides fragilis CcrA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia have been solved, revealing the presence of one [3] or two zinc ions [4] in the active site of the B. cereus enzyme and of two zinc ions in those of the B. fragilis [5] and S. maltophilia enzymes [6]. The ligands of the single zinc ion in the X-ray structure of the B. cereus enzyme are three histidines and one water molecule in the so-called ¢rst binding site. By UV-vis di¡erence spectroscopy of the Co2 -B. cereus 1

enzyme [7], however, a cysteine residue was also identi¢ed as metal ligand. The ligands for one of the zinc ions bound in the active site of the B. fragilis and S. maltophilia enzymes are also three histidines, whereas the second is coordinated by one aspartate, one cysteine, one histidine and one water molecule in the B. cereus and B. fragilis enzymes, and by two histidines, one aspartate and two water molecules in the S. maltophilia enzyme. The Aeromonas hydrophila enzyme retains the same set of metal ligands as the B. cereus and B. fragilis enzymes except that His-86 in the ¢rst binding site is replaced by an asparagine residue (the numbering is that of the B. cereus enzyme). The catalytic activity of the B. fragilis enzyme versus nitroce¢n seemed to be correlated with the simultaneous occupancy of both Zn binding sites [8]. Recently it could be shown that the enzyme is also active as the Zn1 -enzyme with even increased activity versus cefoxitin as the mononuclear enzyme [9]. For the enzyme from B. cereus it could be shown that mono- and binuclear species are active with unchanged or slightly increased turnover numbers for the binuclear enzyme, depending on the enzyme strain and the substrate used [10]. Conversely, the presence of a zinc ion in the second binding site of the A. hydrophila enzyme non-competitively inhibits its activity on imipenem [11]. The enzyme from A. hydrophila di¡ers from all other known class B L-lactamases with respect to its narrow substrate spectrum. In an attempt to identify the metal ion ligands we performed EXAFS spectroscopy of the native enzyme, and electronic spectroscopy of stoichiometrically de¢ned metal ion-substituted derivatives. The spectroscopic results are correlated to metal ion a¤nities and catalytic properties of the di¡erent metal-substituted species. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of enzyme species The preparation of the native and metal-free (apo-) L-lactamase from A. hydrophila AE036 was described before [11,12]. The enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using A280 = 38 500 M31 cm31 for the Zn- and apoenzymes. The Co2 and Cd2 -substituted forms of the enzyme were prepared by direct addition of metal ions to the apoenzyme in either metal-free 15 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, or 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. The Cu2 species were produced in 50 mM TES, pH 7.5. The Cu2 -Zn2 -hybrid was obtained by addition of one equivalent of Zn2 to the Cu2 2 enzyme at pH 7.5.

222 2.2. Metal ion binding constants, UV-vis spectroscopy, kinetics The dissociation constant for a ¢rst metal ion bound (KD P) was obtained from competition experiments with the chromophoric chelator quin-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for Zn2 and Cd2 [13], and with phen-green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for Cu2 . The indicators were titrated with metal ions in the absence and presence of the apoenzyme (protein/indicator ratios were 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3). Changes in absorbance at 266 (quin-2) and at 493 nm (phengreen) were monitored. The program Chemsim was used for numerical data analysis [14]. The dissociation constants for a second Zn2 , Cd2 , Cu2 or Co2 ion bound (KD Q) were determined by equilibrium dialysis experiments at 4³C. Metal analysis was done by atomic absorption spectrometry using a Perkin Elmer 2100 atomic absorption spectrophotometer in the £ame mode for Zn2 , Cd2 and Cu2 or a Perkin Elmer 1100 atomic absorption spectrophotometer in the graphite furnace mode equipped with a HGA-400 Programmer for Co2 . The hydrolysis of imipenem was monitored by following the absorbance variations resulting from the cleavage of the L-lactam ring using vA of 9000 M31 cm31 at 300 nm. Imipenem was a kind gift of Merck Sharp and Dohme, nitroce¢n was purchased from Unipath (Oxford, UK). The Km and kcat values were derived from complete hydrolysis time courses [15] or initial rate measurements. The UV-vis spectra of the various enzyme species (40^50 WM) were recorded at 25³C with a Lambda 2 spectrophotometer from PerkinElmer. 2.3. Extented X-ray absorption ¢ne structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy of the Zn2 +-enzyme The mono-Zn2 -enzyme samples were prepared by successive dialysis steps of the enzyme against 10 mM Bis^Tris bu¡er, pH 6.5 and 10 mM Tricine bu¡er, pH 7.5. After centrifugation, the samples were freeze-dried. The solutions were prepared from freeze-dried enzyme and the ¢nal concentration adjusted to 1.5 mM. The K-edge EXAFS data were collected at beam line D2 (European Molecular Biology Laboratory Outstation Hamburg, Germany) with a positron beam energy of 4.6 GeV and a maximum stored current of î 100 mA in £uorescence mode [16]. The measurements were performed with either frozen solutions or freeze-dried powders at 18K. The energy resolution was better than 2.5 eV. The data were analyzed using the computer program packages EXPROG (developed by C. Hermes and H.F. Nolting at the EMBL-Outstation) and EXCURV92 (developed by N. Binsted, S.W. Cambell, S.J. Gurman and P. Stepherson at SERC Daresbury). For the EXAFS data analysis and the re¢nement of the structural parameters, restraints were included as described by Binsted et al. [17].

The EXAFS spectra of a freeze-dried sample (top) and of a frozen solution (bottom) with theoretical ¢ts are shown to the left and the corresponding Fourier transforms to the right. The ¢ts were obtained with a coordination environment composed of 1 sulfur from cysteine, 2 nitrogens from histidine and 1 additional N/O donor (compare [21]).

excess of both metal ions leads to formation of complexes with L-lactams [19,20]. 3.2. EXAFS spectroscopy of the Zn2 +-enzyme 1 To avoid interference of heavy atoms in bu¡ers such as sulfate or cacodylate with EXAFS measurements, Bis^Tris and Tricine were used at pH 6.5 and 7.5, respectively. The dissociation constants obtained for a single Zn2 bound were 2 þ 1 and 8 þ 2 pM in Bis^Tris and Tricine bu¡ers, respectively, and the kcat /Km values 2.7 and 2.5U106 M31 s31 . The frozen solution and the freeze-dried samples retained 85 and 90% of activity after irradiation, respectively. The rigid structure of systems like imidazole is well known. Therefore in EXAFS restrained re¢nement is applied to such problems [17]. This allows the bond length and angles within the imidazole ligand to change slightly. The Debye-Waller parameters were assumed to be identical if the distances between central Zn-atom and backscattering atoms were similar. This considerably reduces the number of free parameters. The amplitude reduction factor accounting for inelastic losses was ¢xed to 0.925. The interpretation of the extracted k2 -weighted ¢ne structure by these assumptions results in the two ¢ts shown in Fig. 1 at pH 6.5. Data of a freeze-dried sample at pH 7.5 indicated the same geometry (data not shown). The Fourier transform in Fig. 1 clearly shows that the assumed coordination of two histidines matches the typical imidazole î pattern at about 2.6 and 4 A. The peak positions in the Fourier transform di¡er from the geometric distances due to the phase correction one accounts for in the re¢nement. The ¢rst peak in the Fourier transforms re£ects nitrogen atoms of imidazole, oxygen of a N/O donor ligand or OH3 , and sulfur from a cysteine ligand bound to the zinc. Such a ligand composition results in very good ¢ts shown in Fig. 1. It

3. Results 3.1. Metal ion a¤nities and kinetic parameters of native and metal-substituted enzyme species Table 1 compares the dissociation constants for a ¢rst (KD P) and a and second metal ion bound (KD Q). The a¤nity for a ¢rst metal ion decreases in the order Zn2 s Cd2 s Co2 s Cu2 with little variation over the pH range 6.5^7.5, whereas the dissociation constant of Zn2 is considerably increased to 120 þ 14 nM in 50 mM Na^cacodylate, pH 5.5. The a¤nity for a second metal ion decreases in the order Cu2 s Zn2 s Cd2 s Co2 at pH 6.5 and Cd2 s Zn2 s Cu2 s Co2 at pH 7.5. The in£uence of the catalytic metal ions on activity was studied with imipenem which is the most e¤ciently hydrolyzed substrate of the A. hydrophila Zn-L-lactamase [18]. Kinetic data for the native and metal-substituted species are combined in Table 2. Binding of a second Cd2 to the mono-cadmium enzyme at pH 6.5 results in non-competitive inhibition, as it has been previously described for the zinc enzyme [11]. The kcat and Km values of the Cu2 - and 2 Co2 -enzymes could not be determined since the necessary 2

The experimental data were ¢tted to a hyperbolic function.

seems evident that a coordination number of 1 for cysteine sulfur as a ligand to the single zinc ion has to be taken into account. 3.3. Electronic spectroscopy of the Co2 +- and Cu2 +-substituted enzyme The UV-vis di¡erence spectra of the Co2 -enzyme are char1 acterized by two intense sulfur-to-Co2 ligand-to-metal charge

transfer (LMCT) bands in the UV region (A289 = 1800 M31 cm31 and 1940 M31 cm31 , A325 = 450 M31 cm31 and 530 M31 cm31 at pH 6.5 and 7.5, respectively) and additional bands between 500 and 650 nm (A600 = 275 M31 cm31 and 290 M31 cm31 at pH 6.5 and 7.5, respectively) most likely due to Co2 d-d transitions (Fig. 2A). The positions of both UV bands are unchanged in the Co2 -enzyme at pH 7.5. The 2 absorption changes between Co2 - and Co2 -species in the 1 2 visible range (compare second derivatives in Fig. 2A) are characterized by an unchanged A at 600 nm and an increase by 75 M31 cm31 at 550^560 nm. The intensity of either the LMCT or d-d bands displayed by the enzyme upon titration with Co2 (Fig. 2C) at pH 6.5 and 7.5 could be used to determine the KD P values shown in Table 1. The UV-vis spectrum of the Cu2 -enzyme at pH 7.5 exhib1 its absorption maxima at 290 nm (A = 1950 M31 cm31 ), 381 nm (A = 2300 M31 cm31 ) and a shoulder at 795 nm (A = 220 M31 cm31 ) (Fig. 3A). For the Cu2 -species the 381 nm band 2 is shifted to 369 nm (A = 2890 M31 cm31 ) and an additional absorption band is observed at 655 nm (A = 370 M31 cm31 ).

Imipenem was added after previous incubation of the enzyme with the corresponding metal ion concentrations. The maximal activities were reached after 60 min at 25³C. Unless otherwise stated, S.D. values were below 10% of the mean of four di¡erent measurements. In some cases, only the kcat /Km values were determined from ¢rst-order time courses at low substrate concentrations. The enzyme concentrations were 2 and 8 nM for the Zn2 - and Co2 -substituted enzymes, respectively, and 200 nM for the Cd2 - and Cu2 -enzymes.

The bands at 290 nm and in the 365^385 nm range can be attributed to sulfur-to-copper LMCT transitions. The strong absorption maximum at V 6 300 in the spectrum is probably due to imidazole-to-copper LMCT transition(s) [22]. The bands in the visible region of the spectra of the Cu2 - and 1 Cu2 -species can be attributed to d-d transitions due to Cu2 2 in distorted four-coordinate sites [23]. The positions of the d-d band and the LMCT band at 368 nm are identical in the Cu2 -Zn2 -hybrid and in the Cu2 -species with unchanged 2 intensity of the d-d band and a decrease of A368 to 2100 M31 cm31 in the hybrid (Fig. 3B). 4. Discussion The only direct structural information so far available for the coordination environment of the active site zinc ion of the A. hydrophila Zn-L-lactamase results from the presented EXAFS investigation. Spectra obtained for the Zn1 -enzyme (Fig. 1) could be ¢tted with a tetracoordinated ligand geometry î composed of 1 sulfur from Cys-168 at 2.27 A, 2 nitrogens î from histidines and 1 oxygen/nitrogen ligand at 2.00 A. The possibility to ¢t the EXAFS spectra with one cysteine ligand at full occupancy is at variance with results obtained for the Zn2 -species of the B. cereus enzyme, strain 5/B/6, where a 1 fractional contribution of sulfur to the ¢rst coordination sphere gave the best ¢tting results [10,21]. From the available crystal structures of the B. cereus and B. fragilis enzymes [3,5] it becomes obvious that the conserved Cys residue cannot act as a metal ligand in the ¢rst or high a¤nity site of these enzymes. Thus it could be concluded that the Zn(II) ion in the B. cereus Zn1 -enzyme was distributed between the two binding sites with possible implications for the catalytic mechanism [10,21]. Although the enzymes from A. hydrophila and B. cereus show 35% of identical residues, minor changes in the tertiary structure could lead to a possible structural modi¢cation of the metal ion binding sites. The UV-vis spectrum of the Co2 -enzyme clearly exhibits 1 sulfur-to-Co2 LMCT bands at 289 and 325 nm and furthermore shows close resemblance with that of a Co2 -substituted His-94-Cys mutant of carbonic anhydrase [24] (compare Fig. 2B), where 2 His and 1 Cys are the protein ligands in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. It can be concluded that Co2 in the mono-metal species is also bound to cysteine as it has been shown for Zn2 by EXAFS spectroscopy. The minor spectral variations observed upon binding of a second Co2 to Co2 -L-lactamase from A. hydrophila are par1 alleled by recently published spectra of the Co2 -substituted

enzyme from B. fragilis: a ¢rst Co2 bound obviously causes already s 80% of the absorbance of the Co2 -species in the 2 charge transfer as well as the d-d region (compare Fig. 3 in [25]). The weak d-d transitions contributed by a second Co2 bound to the enzyme from A. hydrophila could be the result of an increased coordination number as it was found crystallographically for Zn2 in the second binding site of the S. maltophila enzyme [6]. The di¡erence of dissociation constants for a ¢rst and a second Cu2 bound is signi¢cantly smaller as compared to Zn2 and Co2 (Table 1) and a partition of Cu2 between the two sites in the Cu2 -enzyme and in the Zn2 -Cu2 -hybrid 1 could explain the spectroscopic results. In all cases sulfur-tocopper LMCT bands are observed with the highest intensity for the Cu2 -species (Fig. 3B). The identity of band positions 2 and intensities in the d-d region of the absorption spectra are giving no evidence to decide whether Cu2 in the Zn2 -Cu2 hybrid enzyme is preferentially bound to a speci¢c binding site. Although Zn2 preferentially binds to a ligand set including Cys in the Zn2 -species the Zn2 -Cu2 -hybrid shows a strong 1 contribution of sulfur-to-Cu2 charge transfer. This seems surprising since the relative magnitude of a¤nities for Zn2 and Cu2 di¡ers by ¢ve orders of magnitude for a ¢rst metal ion bound whereas binding of a second metal ion is comparably strong for both metal ions. The observation of LMCT bands for the hybrid implies that Zn2 and Cu2 compete for Cys sulfur or share it as a bridging ligand. The reduced intensity of the LMCT bands in the Zn2 -Cu2 -hybrid could be 1 1 the result of a partial occupation of the Cys binding site by Cu2 . Very similar results have been obtained with a Zn-Cohybrid enzyme which could only be produced with large excess of Co2 (2 mM) causing turbidity of enzyme solutions (data not shown). The large deviation between KD P and KD Q for all the metal ions studied might be the result of strong negative cooperativity connected to binding of a second metal ion. As it has been observed with other zinc enzymes, the Co2 1 enzyme is the most active one after the natural Zn2 -species 1 with imipenem as substrate (Table 2). Binding of a second Zn2 non-competitively inhibits the enzyme in the 5.5^8.0 pH range. At pH 6.5, a similar e¡ect was observed upon binding of a second Cd2 to the Cd2 -species. For the 1 Cu2 - and Co2 -enzymes, the same experiments could not be performed because of the direct interactions between the free ions and carbapenems interfering with the activity measurements.

Although Zn-L-lactamase from A. hydrophila has two conserved metal ion binding sites it is surprising that the binuclear enzyme species are non-competitively inhibited by a second metal ion bound. Therefore it may be concluded that the mono-nuclear species represents the native enzyme. Comparable to the interpretations of experimental results derived for the enzyme from B. fragilis [9] and B. cereus [10] a role of a second metal ion binding site during catalysis may be suggested. A transient occupation of this site by zinc with a bound reaction intermediate could explain its presence. In case of the binuclear enzymes such a translocation would be super£uous. The non-competitive inhibition observed for the A. hydrophila enzyme could then be interpreted in terms of a less e¤cient catalytic mechanism of the binuclear enzyme.
