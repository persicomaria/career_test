Introduction The first step in the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) involves the binding of the viral gp120 envelope glycoprotein to the CD4 receptor on the surface of a new potential host cell (reviewed in Wyatt and Sodroski, 1998). Biochemical and thermodynamic studies show that this binding induces substantial conformational changes in gp120 (Moore et al., 1990; Myszka et al., 2000). Crystal structures of CD4 (Ryu et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1990; Wu et al., 1997), of gp120 in complex with CD4 (Kwong et al., 1998, 2000), and most recently of unliganded gp120 (Chen et al., 2005) define the conformational change in detail. CD4 remains essentially fixed throughout the binding reaction. In contrast, gp120 undergoes a remarkable refolding, with roughly half of its core secondary structure rearranging; when modeled into the context of the viral spike, these rearrangements move select structural elements over 40 Å (Chen et al., 2005). The precise interface of CD4 with gp120 involves a mostly contiguous surface contributed by three sequence segments of CD4: residues 31­35, residues 40­ 48, and residues 58­64 (Figure 1A). Of these, residues 40­48, which form part of the CDR2-like antiparallel  strands of CD4, are the most important and account for 40% of the total contact surface (Kwong et al., 1998; Moebius et al., 1992; Sweet et al., 1991). The extensive structural information combined with the inability to date of small molecule screening to identify effective CD4-mimetic antagonists has spurred structure-based efforts. These range from chemical mimicry of the CDR2-like loop (Chen et al., 1992) to phage display selection (Choi et al., 2001; Ferrer and Harrison, 1999) and scaffold transplantation (Martin and Vita, 2000). In general, transplantation of a conformational binding site to a smaller scaffold is a difficult endeavor (reviewed in Fernandez-Carneado et al., 2000 and Martin and Vita, 2000). The gp120 interface is particularly daunting in that it is relatively large, contains unusual cavities, and is composed of primarily backbone interactions, arranged by gp120 refolding (Kwong et al., 1998, 2000; Myszka et al., 2000). Nonetheless, attempts to transfer the CD4-gp120 binding surface have met with success, especially with the scorpion toxin scyllatoxin, a 31 amino acid protein with three disulfide bonds holding together an  helix and two antiparallel  strands (Martin et al., 2003; Vita et al., 1999). These efforts produced CD4M33, which showed binding affinities with select isolates comparable to CD4 (Martin et al., 2003). Its success prompted a number of questions: in light of the conformational flexibility of gp120, what conformation does CD4M33 recognize?

Summary The binding surface on CD4 for the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein has been transplanted previously onto a scorpion-toxin scaffold. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to characterize atomic-level details of gp120 with this transplant, CD4M33. Despite known envelope flexibility, the conformation of gp120 induced by CD4M33 was so similar to that induced by CD4 that localized measures were required to distinguish ligand-induced differences from lattice variation. To investigate relationships between structure, function, and mimicry, an F23 analog of CD4M33 was devised. Structural and thermodynamic analyses showed F23 to be a better molecular mimic of CD4 than CD4M33. F23 also showed increased neutralization breadth, against diverse isolates of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVcpz. Our results lend insight into the stability

How similar is this to the conformation induced by CD4? To what degree is CD4M33 a molecular mimic of CD4? Here, we use X-ray crystallography to address these questions. Our results represent the first in-depth atomic-level description of the successful transplantation of a complex binding surface to a smaller scaffold. We use the opportunity to address questions of molecular mimicry, to explore how evolutionary diversity may affect such considerations, and to discuss tradeoffs between overall neutralization breadth and specific potency against target subsets. Results CD4M33 Structure in Complex with HIV-1 Core gp120 To define the CD4M33 mimicry at the atomic level, we crystallized and solved the structure of CD4M33 in complex with core gp120 from the primary HIV-1 isolate YU2 and the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of the 17b antibody (Figure 1). The crystals were space group P21 (a = 51.6 Å, b = 157.0 Å, c = 108.9 Å,  = 93.5°) with two ternary complexes in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by using molecular replacement with the previously determined ternary structure (Kwong et al., 2000) of core YU2 gp120 in complex with CD4 and Fab 17b. After rigid-body refinement of the gp120 and Fab 17b orientations, electron density for CD4M33 was clearly defined, and this was fitted, starting with the NMR structure of the free CD4M33 (P.B. and C.R., unpublished data). Refinement with 20­2.75 Å data produced an R value of 20.2% and an Rfree of 27.5% (Table 1). The overall structures of core gp120 in the Fab 17b ternary complexes with CD4M33 and CD4 were similar. The primary structural differences were related to lattice interactions at the core N terminus: in the CD4 complex, a lattice contact with a symmetry-related 17b Fab disrupts the first three residues; in the CD4M33 complex, the first six residues are involved in a lattice interaction with the inner domain of a symmetry-related gp120 molecule. There were also differences at the site of V1/V2 loop truncation and in the V4 loop, which was disordered in the mimetic ternary structure. Superpositions excluding these regions showed overall C root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.89/0.88 Å (the two numbers are from the two independent CD4M33 complexes in the P21 asymmetric unit). These rms deviations are comparable to the C rms deviation (0.87 Å) between the CD4:gp120:17b ternary complexes of the different gp120 isolates, YU2 and HXBc2. The antiparallel  strands of CD4M33 hydrogen bond to the 15 strand of gp120 in a manner similar to the

CDR2-like loop of CD4 (Figure 1B). Superposition of the main chain atoms of residues 22­26 of CD4M33 and residues 42­46 of CD4 produced rms deviations of 0.43/0.49 Å and of 0.93/1.06 Å for the CDR2-like region (residues 16­27 for CD4M33 and residues 36­47 for CD4). Four hydrogen bonds between residues 22­26 and gp120 (equivalent to CD4 residues 42­46), one from the side chain oxygen of Ser22 and three from the main chain atoms of residues 24 and 26, are conserved in the CD4M33:YU2core structure. The stereochemistry of these bonds is remarkably similar, especially for the intermolecular antiparallel strands (Figure 1B). The mimicry by CD4M33 of the two other sequence segments of CD4 (residues 31­35 and 58­64) was less successful. The  strands of CD4M33 are shorter than those of the CDR2-like loop of CD4 and, consequently, do not extend to make contacts like residues 31­35 of CD4. Arg9 of CD4M33, meanwhile, only partially mimics the important Arg59 contact of CD4; two conformations were observed, only one of which makes a salt bridge with Asp368 of gp120 (Figure 1C). Other portions of the mimetic, however, bind to the surface otherwise occupied by 58­64 of CD4; for example, thiopropionic acid at the N terminus of CD4M33 contacts gp120 at a surface that interacts with CD4 residues 59 and 62. The contact surface between CD4M33 and gp120 is 449/475 Å2 for CD4M33, approximately 55% of the CD4 interface. A primary "hotspot" of interaction (Clackson and Wells, 1995) in the gp120 interface involves Phe43 of CD4, which binds at the nexus of the inner, outer, and bridging sheet domains of gp120, where an unusual interfacial cavity resides (Kwong et al., 1998) (Figure 1B). In CD4M33, a biphenyl side chain was designed to not only mimic Phe43, but to protrude and fill the CD4-gp120 interfacial cavity. This biphenyl group (residue 23 of CD4M33) contributes 168/170 Å2 (37%) of the total area, with roughly 80 Å2 contributed by its second ring, where it reaches into the heart of gp120. The footprints of the contact surface made by residues 20­27 of CD4M33 and residues 40­47 of CD4 are very similar (Figure 1D). In the CD4M33:YU2core complex, this region accounts for more than 80% of the interface. We attribute the high affinity of CD4M33, despite making only half the contacts as CD4, to filling the CD4gp120 interfacial cavity with the second ring of the unnatural biphenyl side chain. However, biphenyl groups are relatively rigid, with limited flexibility along their long axes and dihedral constraints between their two rings (Dzyabchenko and Scheraga, 2004). The observed ring-ring dihedrals were 38°/40° for CD4M33 in the CD4M33:YU2core complexes (the two angles specified here are the observed angles for the two independent CD4M33 molecules in the asymmetric unit).

proteins with bound biphenyl-containing compounds, the dihedrals vary from 10° to 53°, suggesting that the ring-ring dihedral of the biphenyl group in the CD4M33:gp120 complex is not highly unfavorable. However, the observed orientation of the first ring of the biphenyl moiety (chi1 -74°/-64°, chi2 -48°/-59°) was more than 10° different from those of the Phe43 of CD4 (chi1 -55°, chi2 -67°) (Figure 2B). This difference in orientation suggested that to accommodate the biphenyl moiety, the biphenyl side chain and neighboring atoms adopt an orientation that sacrifices mimicry. F23 Structure in Complex with HIV-1 Core gp120 To investigate the effects of the rigid biphenyl and to increase mimicry, we synthesized a modified CD4M33, with the biphenyl side chain of residue 23 replaced with a simple phenyl ring (Figure 2A). This modified molecule, F23, partially reverts to previous generations of the scorpion-toxin mimetic, for example, CD4M9, which contained a Phe at this position (Vita et al., 1999). We were able to crystallize F23 in a similar P21 lattice as the parent CD4M33. Refinement with 20­2.20 Å data produced an R value of 20.9% with an Rfree of 26.8% (Table 1). Because of lattice symmetry, we were able to use difference fourier analysis to highlight differences

between the CD4M33 and F23 complexes (Figure S1; see the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Difference fourier peaks clustered toward the mimetic:gp120 interface. The highest peaks were associated with the second phenyl ring of the biphenyl adduct. Overall, difference fourier analysis indicated that the CD4M33 and F23 complexes were extremely similar. In terms of a comparison between the CD4, CD4M33, and F23 complexes, Figure 2B shows that substitution of the CD4M33 biphenyl side chain with a phenyl side chain enhanced mimicry of CD4 at this particular position. We asked whether this increased ligand mimicry could be detected in the gp120 structure. Superposition of the YU2 gp120 molecules from the two asymmetric units of F23 with the YU2 gp120 in the CD4 ternary complex gave overall C rms deviations of 0.87/0.85 Å (Table 2). These superpositions were not significantly different than those observed with CD4M33 (0.89/0.88 Å). Much of the overall deviation relates to intrinsic gp120 flexibility, especially in the coreceptor binding region, coupled to lattice variation. Indeed, overall C rms deviations show that YU2 gp120 differs more between independent copies in the asymmetric unit (0.31­0.42 Å) than between lattice-equiva-

lent CD4M33 and F23 variants of the mimetic (0.26­ 0.32 Å). The lattice influence on structure can be seen with even the tightly folded mimetic; the helix-loopstrand connection of CD4M33 is substantially different between the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1C). A full matrix of superpositions, both overall and of individual gp120 domains, is shown in Table 2. These superpositions show that the conformation of gp120 induced by both CD4M33 and F23 is so similar to the conformation induced by CD4 that overall measures of analysis, even when reduced to individual domains, could not easily distinguish ligandinduced differences in gp120 conformation from latticeinduced variation. Localized Measures of Structural Mimicry: DistanceSorted Difference Distances, Localized Rms Deviations, and Residue-Specific Contact Surfaces In structure-based drug design, it is useful to quantify changes in the target molecule, as opposed to the lead compound, since lead compounds can vary greatly, making comparisons difficult. Prompted by difficulties in using overall rms deviations to distinguish ligandinduced changes from lattice- or isolate-induced variation, we attempted other means to quantify such changes in the gp120 target molecule. Qualitatively, we could observe differences in gp120 outside of the binding interface. An example is shown in Figure 2C, in which a water channel that forms between the bridging sheet and the inner domain of gp120 is shown. This channel was initially highlighted in the HXBc2 and YU2 core structures (Kwong et al., 2000), and it is also the location of residues, which, when mutated, affect the binding of the CD4-antagonist, BMS-378806 (Lin et al., 2003; Madani et al., 2004). Comparison of the shape of the water channel in these three complexes showed greater similarity between the F23 and CD4 complexes than with the CD4M33 complex. Such qualitative comparisons, however, have limited utility, and thus we sought quantitative means of accessing structural similarity. We observed that in the ligand (CD4, CD4M33, or F23), lattice variation had a larger effect on regions further from the interaction hotspot. Thus, with CD4 bound to gp120 in different lattices, the second domain of CD4 shows greater variation than the first domain, which interacts with gp120 (Kwong et al., 2000); with the two asymmetric unit variants of either CD4M33 or F23 bound to gp120, the  helix showed greater variation than the  strands, which interact with gp120 (Figure 2B). In light of these observations, we asked whether localized quantifications, focused on the interaction hotspot, might be less influenced by lattice variation and thus might be more revealing. Several types of localized quantification were carried out. We used rms deviation, restricted to the sphere or shell surrounding the interaction hotspot (Figure 3). We also complemented the rms deviation analysis with difference distance matrices (Nishikawa et al., 1972; Richards and Kundrot, 1988). These have the advantage of being superposition independent and also being residue specific. We modified these methods with distance sorting to focus the difference distance matrix. We also extracted overall summations of the difference distance

matrix, by using either normalized linear summations or rms of the matrix elements (Figure 2D). When restricted to a 10 Å sphere centered on the C of the biphenyl to phenyl change of CD4M33 to F23, "distance-sorted" difference distance matrices of gp120 residues showed F23 to emulate the structural change induced by CD4 significantly better then CD4M33 (Figure 2D). The importance of using localized measures to reduce lattice influences is demonstrated in Figure 3, in which a full complement of distance-sorted difference distance matrices (and associated rms deviations) have been calculated with larger radial cutoffs. Because of the high similarity (and small differences) between the various gp120 structures, we analyzed the role that coordinate error might play. This varies with respect to resolution: the best structures (the F23 complex at 2.2 Å resolution and the CD4:HXBc2core at 2.25 Å resolution) had Luzzatti estimated errors in coordinate of w0.3 Å; the more weakly diffracting structures (the CD4M33 complex at 2.75 Å and the CD4:YU2core at 2.9 Å) had estimated errors of about 20% greater. These resolution-dependent overall estimated errors were comparable to the observed rms deviations in C positions between lattice-equivalent gp120 molecules in the F23 and CD4M33 complex structures (0.26­ 0.32 Å), but were substantially less than the differences between lattice-nonequivalent structures (0.46­0.48 Å) (Table 2). The fortuitous occurrence of CD4 structures at low and high resolution, as well as of mimetic structure at low and high resolution, coupled to the presence of two molecules in each of the mimetic asymmetric units, allowed the influence of resolution-dependent coordinate error to be decoupled (Figure 3). For example, the upper right panel of Figure 3 shows that the observed differences were similar between the two asymmetric units of CD4M33 (at 2.75 Å) and F23 (at 2.2 Å). Thus, while resolution-dependent coordinate error does influence comparisons, the multiplicity of structural information was able to control for some of this resolution-dependent ambiguity. Finally, we examined the residue-specific contacts of gp120 and compare the interactive surface of gp120 with CD4, CD4M33, and F23 (Table 3). CD4 contacted 43 residues in YU2, 19 of which were not contacted by either CD4M33 or F23. CD4M33 contacted 32 residues (not including 2 residues with minor contacts observed in only 1 of the 2 complexes in the P21 crystal), of which 9 were not contacted by CD4. F23 contacted 23 residues (not including 4 residues with minor nonconserved contacts), all of which were also contacted by both CD4 and CD4M33. Thus, although F23 had an interface only half the size of CD4, all of the residues it contacted were also contacted by CD4. In summary, while overall rms deviations were not very revealing, localized measures of analysis indicated that, in terms of gp120 conformation and contact surface, F23 had a higher degree of CD4 mimicry than did CD4M33. Thermodynamic Analysis of CD4, CD4M33, and F23 Binding to HIV-1 gp120 To extend our analysis of transplantation mimicry from the static crystal structures to the binding process, we measured the thermodynamics of 17b and gp120 binding for CD4, CD4M33, and F23 by using isothermal tit-

The top portion of the table shows overall gp120 rms deviations after superposition for main chain atoms (lower left, underlined numbers) and C atoms (upper right). The bottom portion of the table shows gp120 domain rms deviations for C atoms after superposition of the outer domain of gp120 (lower left) or the inner domain of gp120 (upper right). Residues used in the overall superposition were 89­126, 196­394, and 412­492 of core gp120, with 9, 5, and 17 residues removed from the N terminus, the site of V1/V2 loop truncation, and the V4 loop, respectively. Main chain atoms consisted of the backbone nitrogen, C, backbone carbon, and carbonyl oxygen. Residues used were 89­119, 204­255, and 475­492 for the inner domain (I); 256­394, 412­422, and 436­474 for the outer domain (O); 120­126, 196­203, and 423­435 for the bridging sheet (B). Numbers in italics report rms deviations for domains not involved in the superposition.

ration calorimetry (Table 4). One of the hallmarks of the CD4-induced conformational change in gp120 is the formation of the coreceptor binding site (Trkola et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1996). The 17b antibody binds to the coreceptor binding site, and, in the core context, its affinity is highly dependent on the presence of CD4. Its binding thus provides a measure of the conformational change induced in gp120. The 17b bound core YU2 gp120 with a relatively large entropic change and low affinity. Prior formation of the CD4:YU2core complex altered 17b binding dramatically, with entropy decreasing 3-fold and affinity increasing w200-fold. This dramatic alteration was also seen with 17b binding to the CD4M33:YU2core, which showed extremely similar thermodynamics (Table 4). Binding to core YU2 by CD4 showed the unusual enthalpy and entropy indicative of

gp120 refolding observed previously, although the overall entropic change was about 30% less than that observed previously with full-length YU2 (Kwong et al., 2002). Binding to core by CD4M33 or F23 showed significantly lower entropies, about half the level of that observed with CD4. Because core gp120, which is only two-thirds the size of full-length gp120, is missing significant portions of functionally important regions (the N/C termini and also the V1, V2, and V3 regions), we analyzed binding to a full-length gp120, engineered to remove only the V1/V2, which may sterically occlude the CD4 site. Unlike core gp120, this V1/V2 gp120 is functionally active for both receptor binding and virus entry (Cao et al., 1997; Wyatt et al., 1993), and thus its behavior should be more biologically relevant than that of core gp120.

(D) Distance-sorted difference distance matrices of gp120. The YU2 gp120 C distances (Å) from Phe43 of CD4 were sorted and are shown along with the corresponding gp120 residue in the far-left column. Difference distance matrices composed of these gp120 residues were calculated for various gp120 complexes with CD4, CD4M33, and F23. Each i,j matrix element shows the distance between atom i and atom j in the first specified structure minus the distance between the same atoms in the second specified structure. The difference distance matrices could be quantified by rms of the difference distances ("square") or by linear summation of the absolute value of the difference distance normalized by the number of matrix elements ("linear"). Both values are shown for nondiagonal matrix elements. The matrices show both visually and quantitatively that the structural changes induced in gp120 by CD4 are more closely mimicked by F23 than CD4M33. (Comparable rms deviations are given in Figure 3, with a full complement of distance-sorted difference distance matrices.)

Figure 3. Distance-Sorted Difference Distance Matrices for gp120 Complexed with CD4, CD4M33, and F23 Rms deviations and difference distance matrices provide overall and atom-specific quantifications of gp120 structural differences. To quantify the CD4 or mimetic influence of gp120 structures, we focused on gp120 residues around the Phe43 hotspot of CD4 (or the equivalent position in CD4M33 or F23). The 50 closest C positions of YU2 gp120 from Phe43 of CD4 were sorted and divided into three groups. These distances and the corresponding gp120 residues are shown in the upper left of the figure. The rms deviations of main chain atoms (C, N, C) for each group and for each pair of structures are shown. Difference distance matrix plots were calculated between structural pairs by using the distance-sorted atoms; for each pair of structures, "1" and "2," the difference distance D12 = |ai - aj|1 - |ai - aj|2 was calculated, where ai and aj are the atomic positions for the C of residues i and j, respectively. Differences are colored in ten increments, between -1.0 Å (red) and 1.0 Å (blue). The influence of lattice and isolate differences can be seen in the groups beyond 10 Å distance from Phe43. These obscure the ligand-induced differences in gp120 due to differences in binding to CD4, CD4M33, or F23. For example, in the 10­13.5 Å shell, HXBc2 and YU2 bound to CD4 show an rms deviation of 0.32 Å, which is significantly larger than the HXBc2:CD4 versus YU2:F23 rms deviations of 0.28/0.24 Å. Such difficulties in discriminating lattice- and isolate-induced structural changes from ligand-specific ones highlight the utility of focusing on structural hotspots with distance-sorted difference distance matrices to reveal important ligand-induced structural differences.

"Main," "side," and "total" refer to the surface area of the main chain atoms, the surface area of the side chain atoms, and the total surface area for each gp120 residue specified. Residues are colored blue if they have a contact surface common to CD4, CD4M33, and F23, black if the contact is not conserved, and red if the contact is unique to both independent copies of CD4M33 in the P21 crystal.

We observed that CD4 binding to V1/V2 gp120 showed highly unusual enthalpic and entropic changes, approaching -60 kcal/mol and 50 kcal/mol, respectively. Interestingly, CD4M33 displayed changes of only about two-thirds of this number, whereas F23 binding displayed enthalpic and entropic changes very similar to those observed with CD4, -58.6 versus -54.8 kcal/

mol and 47.1 versus 45.6 kcal/mol, respectively, although it had substantially lower affinity (Table 4). The results suggested that the mimetics, CD4M33 and F23, were both able to induce many of the same conformational changes in gp120 as CD4, especially with regard to the portion of the coreceptor binding site bound by 17b. However, in terms of the more biologically relevant

Each experiment was repeated 2­5 times, and the numbers are shown as mean ± standard error. Experimental constraints limited the ability to measure 17b binding to additional complexes. For YU2core/F23, the weak affinity between F23 and gp120 prevented accurate secondary ligand titration; with YU2 V1/V2 complexes, the 17b affinity was subnanomolar, too tight to be measured by titration calorimetry.

V1/V2 gp120, F23 replicated the CD4-induced changes in entropy and enthalpy more accurately than CD4M33. Neutralization Breadth of CD4, CD4M33, and F23 on HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVcpz In light of the structural and thermodynamic mimicry of CD4 by CD4M33 and F23, we investigated the mimicry of another unique property of CD4, the ability of soluble CD4 to compete with cell surface CD4 and neutralize diverse isolates across the entire primate immunodeficiency lentiviral family (Smith et al., 1987; Trkola et al., 1995). We explored the neutralization capacities of CD4, CD4M33, and F23 with a panel of primate immunodeficiency viruses ranging from clade B isolates all the way to HIV-2 and SIVcpz (Table 5). Because primary isolates vary in their sensitivity to soluble CD4 neutralization (Daar and Ho, 1991; Moore et al., 1992), we normalized for overall neutralization sensitivity by examining relative neutralization potency. This allowed us to estimate the G of binding for CD4, CD4M33, and

F23, and we did so as a function of genetic distance (Figure 4). Such an analysis provides an isolateaveraged estimate of the relative neutralization potential. For clade B viruses, similar to the HXBc2 isolate in which the initial mimetic design was carried out, CD4M33 was only 0.2 kcal/mol less effective than CD4, whereas F23 was 1.9 kcal/mol less effective (Figure 4, y intercepts). These results, estimated directly from neutralization potency, agree with the thermodynamically observed G of binding to V1/V2 YU2 gp120 (Tables 4 and 6). They show that the single phenyl extension of CD4M33 into the hydrophobic interfacial cavity enhances neutralization potency by roughly 10fold. A similar extension on CD4 might lead to similarly increased neutralization potency, but our results suggest that it might also lead to reduced breadth. Mimicry as Defined by Neutralization Breadth We observed that the change in GN as a function of genetic distance could be fit linearly (Figure 4). Such an

Figure 4. Free Energy Difference of CD4, CD4M33, and F23 Binding as a Function of gp120 Genetic Distance For a compound (n) with a binding constant of K(n) that inhibits virus at an IC50(n), there exists a function f(n) such that f(n) = IC50(n)/K(n). The free energy, G, is equal to -RTln(K), and thus the difference in free energy for two inhibitors, n = 1 and n = 2, is G = G(1) - G(2) = [-RTlnK(1)] - [-RTlnK(2)] = -RTln [K(1)/K(2)] = -RTln {[IC50(1)/f(1)]/[IC50(2)/f(2)]} = -RT ln {[IC50(1)/IC50(2)] [f(2)/f(1)]}. Although f(n) is dependent on a number of different variables, such as temperature, viral assay, and overall neutralization sensitivity, when using the same assay, normalizing with the same virus, and using inhibitors that work through the same mechanism, f(1) can approximate f(2), and G z -RT ln [IC50(1)/IC50(2)] h GN. This relates the relative neutralization potency of CD4, CD4M33, and F23 (Table 5) to the difference in free energy as a function of genetic distance. The vertical axis shows GN in units of kcal/mol, and the horizontal axis shows genetic distance in units of average amino acid change per residue from HXBc2, the isolate used in the original scorpion toxin transplantation design. The y intercept gives a normalized relative potency against clade B isolates like HXBc2, and the slope shows the change in relative potency as a function of evolutionary distance. The variance of the function relates to strain-specific effects and also to how well f(1) approximates f(2). As expected, the variance between the two mimetics is smaller than with CD4; nonetheless, the correlation coefficients (r) for all three functions are reasonable (59%­86%). HIV-1 group M viral isolates are depicted with open circles, SIVcpz isolates with filled triangles, HIV-1 group O isolates with open triangles, and HIV-2 isolates with filled circles.

analysis provides an alternative means to judge mimicry. A perfect mimetic of CD4 would have a slope of zero and a variance related to the error in measurement. With HXBc2 as a reference, we observed for CD4M33 versus CD4 a slope of 6.1 kcal/mol per average amino acid change per residue, and we observed for F23 versus CD4 a slope of 2.8, both with similar variances (Figure 4). One can also compare F23 and CD4M33, independent of CD4; such quantification indicates that F23 retains its relative potency across evolutionarily diverse viral isolates better than CD4M33, with F23 neutralizing HIV-2 strains, 7312A and UC2, with IC50s of 7­8 g/ml and SIVcpz GAB strains with IC50s of 0.3­1.0 g/ml (Table 5). We investigated the effect of altering the choice of evolutionary origin on the correlation of G as a function of genetic distance. The linear fit of GN was calculated when either HIV-1 isolate YU2, SIVcpz isolate GAB-1fl, or HIV-2 isolate UNC1NsMf were chosen as evolutionary origins (Table 6). The slope and correlation of the linear fit depend on the choice of isolate from which the genetic distance is calculated, as each choice of origin provides a different vantage point from which to view the evolutionary landscape. The fit is only linear to the extent that there is a linear correlation between an evolutionary direction and a particular ligand feature. Nonetheless, we found that if YU2, HIV-2, or SIVcpz isolates were chosen as origins, CD4M33 versus CD4 had, on average, twice the absolute slope as F23 versus CD4 (Table 6). These results indicate that the relative slope gives an indication of mimicry, even if very different isolates are chosen as evolutionary references. Discussion HIV utilizes a two receptor mechanism coupled to substantial gp120 refolding to maintain binding to host re-

ceptors, while avoiding neutralization by antibody. Prior to interaction with cell surface CD4, the viral spike is protected by multiple mechanisms of evasion and is highly resistant to antibody binding. Upon attachment to CD4, gp120 undergoes a remarkable refolding (Chen et al., 2005), and the spike becomes primed for interaction (e.g., with coreceptor or with the drug Fuzeon), but the close proximity of the target cell membrane restricts antibody binding (Labrijn et al., 2003). Our results with the scorpion-toxin mimetics of CD4 suggest that, once induced, the CD4 bound conformation of gp120 is relatively stable. Even though thermodynamic analysis indicated that F23 and CD4M33 induced only half the entropic change in core gp120 as CD4, the observed conformation of gp120 was virtually identical in all three liganded structures. (Such similarity cannot be attributed to 17b, as binding of 17b to both the YU2 core:CD4 and YU2 core:CD4M33 showed similar and relatively small entropies of interaction.) The smaller interfaces of the mimetic probably only stabilize a subset of the CD4 interactions: significant entropy resides in more distal regions until crystallization drives gp120 to the observed conformation. Interestingly, much of the conformational change between unliganded and CD4 bound gp120 occurs in the inner domain of gp120, but neither CD4 nor F23 make direct contacts with it. With F23, we find that less than 400 Å2 of interactive surface--on the bridging sheet and outer domain--is sufficient to snap the inner domain into its CD4 bound conformation. The large conformational change induced by CD4 exposes cryptic epitopes on gp120, which have been the target of vaccine efforts (Fouts et al., 2002). The similarity observed between F23-induced and CD4-induced conformations of gp120 and the small size of F23 relative to CD4 suggest that F23:gp120 complexes may have utility in this regard. The lower affinity of F23, how-

Different isolates were chosen as the evolutionary origin, and the linear fit to GN was calculated for each as described in Figure 4. Slopes (kcal/mol per average amino acid change per residue), y intercepts (kcal/mol), and correlation coefficients from these linear fits are shown. The average |slope| represents the average of the absolute value of the slopes obtained from using each of the specified evolutionary origins in linear GN fits. Because we measured the affinity of YU2 directly by isothermal titration calorimetry, we had an independent means of judging the accuracy of the GN calculations. The thermodynamically measured G of binding to V1/V2 YU2 gp120 were 1.2 and 2.3 kcal/mol for CD4M33 and F23, respectively (Table 4), which agreed with the 0.5 and 2.1 kcal/mol isolate-averaged estimate (y intercept) obtained by using YU2 as the evolutionary origin.

ever, may necessitate immunization with covalently linked complexes, and the thiopropionic N-terminal residue of the F23 N terminus would need to be replaced to facilitate genetic linkage. Our analysis defines two quantitative measures of mimicry, one based on structure, and the other based on evolutionary conservation of function. The distancesorted difference distance matrices provide a superposition-independent measure of mimicry that can be focused on the appropriate interaction hotspot. The GN, meanwhile, permits an isolate-averaged estimate of the difference in free energy of binding as a function of genetic distance. These quantifications define a structure-based strategy for enhancing mimetic breadth. The premise behind this strategy is that increased structural mimicry of evolutionarily conserved interactions should lead to an increase in neutralization breadth. Because we define metrics for evaluating structural mimicry in the target molecule, comparative analyses of diverse lead compounds are possible. In comparing CD4M33 with CD4 to create F23, we focused on increasing molecular mimicry at an interaction hotspot and found that this resulted in a substantial increase in neutralization breadth. However, within the HIV-1 subset of viruses, F23 displayed substantially reduced neutralization potency. It remains to be seen whether our strategy can simultaneously increase both breadth and potency. The second ring of the biphenyl induced structural alterations in gp120, reducing CD4 mimicry; if a different extension were used that maintained the CD4-induced conformation, our results suggest that such an extension would better maintain both potency and mimicry. In terms of CD4M33 and F23, there is considerable room for improvement, as the other important hotspot of CD4 involving the Arg59 salt bridge is not fully optimized. Many drugs, including a significant fraction of current HIV-1 therapeutics such as protease and fusion inhibitors (reviewed in Matthews et al., 2004 and Wlodawer and Vondrasek, 1998), are mimetic antagonists. Our results with CD4, CD4M33, and F23 suggest that, once the relative breadths of neutralization are known, the structures of the different complexes themselves can be used to define the appropriate target to emulate.

By using atomic-level structural analysis, thermodynamic characterization of binding, and assessment of neutralization capacities with an evolutionarily diverse panel of viral isolates, our studies serve to define and quantify overlapping facets of molecular mimicry. The binding surface transplantation or protein grafting of CD4 onto a scorpion-toxin scaffold shows some of the power of atomic-level structural design. Our studies suggest that, when considering therapeutic breadth, analysis and quantification of molecular mimicry as demonstrated by the F23 prototype described here should play an important role. Such considerations have increasing urgency in light of the need for therapeutics that are effective against the diverse isolates of the developing world and the ever increasing diversity of HIV-1 (Coffin, 1995; Korber et al., 2001; Vidal et al., 2000).
Experimental Procedures Synthesis of CD4 Mini-Protein, Protein Expression, Purification, and Complex Preparation The CD4 mimetics, CD4M33 and F23, were synthesized by solidphase methods as described (Martin et al., 2000, 2003). Constructs of HIV-1 envelope gp120 proteins, core YU2 and V1/V2 YU2, were expressed in Drosophila Schneider 2 lines, and the ternary complexes of CD4 mimetics with core YU2 gp120 and Fab 17b were prepared as described (Kwong et al., 2000) substituting CD4 mimetics for two-domain CD4. The addition of 0.1 M CD4 mimetic to the gel filtration column buffer helped to stabilize formation of ternary complexes during gel filtration purification. Crystallization, X-Ray Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement Vapor-diffusion hanging-drop crystallizations were used, with 0.5 l protein solution (4­7 mg/ml in 0.35 M NaCl, 5 mM Tris [pH 7.1]) combined with 0.5 l 0.3 M Gly-Gly-Gly tripeptide and 0.5 l reservoir solution of 14% PEG 4000, 14% isopropanol, 0.07 M sodium citrate (pH 5.6) (70% of Crystal Screen reagent 40, Hampton Research) with 5 M NaCl added to the reservoir to a concentration of 0.35 M after the crystallization droplet had been set up to counter balance the NaCl in the protein solution. Crystals were crosslinked over a 20 l sitting droplet of 1.5% glutaraldehyde for 45 min by using the procedure of Lusty (1999), transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing the reservoir solution with 20% ethylene glycol and 10% 2R, 3R-butanediol for 1­2 min, and flash cooled to 100 K° for data collection. X-ray data were collected at a wavelength of 1.00 Å and were processed and reduced with HKL2000 (Otwi-

nowski and Minor, 1997). The structure of CD4M33:YU2core:Fab 17b was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) as implemented in the CCP4 package (CCP4, 1994). The structure of core YU2 gp120 bound to Fab 17b in the 1G9N coordinates was used as a search model, with the solution yielding a Patterson correlation coefficient (10­4 Å data) of 48.3%. The density for the CD4M33 was clear after rigid body refinement of core gp120 and Fab 17b, and the free structure of CD4M33 as determined by NMR was used as the starting point for further refinement. Using programs O for model building (Jones et al., 1991) and CNS for refinement (Brünger et al., 1998), side chains on the initial models were corrected, and the models were subjected to torsionangle-simulated annealing with slow cooling, iterative manual fitting, automated water placement, and positional and individual isotropic B factor refinements. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used in the initial stages of the refinement, but then removed when it became clear that lattice effects caused substantial structural differences. An Rfree test set consisting of 10% of the data was used as a monitor throughout the refinement. The crystals of F23:YU2core:Fab 17b were isomorphous to those of CD4M33: YU2core:Fab 17b; its structure was solved by using the CD4M33 ternary complex as a starting model. Refinement was carried out as described for the CD4M33 complex. Model Analysis All superpositions were performed by using lsqkab in CCP4 (CCP4, 1994) or lsqman in the Uppsala software package (Kleywegt, 1996). Molecular surface interactions were calculated by using MS (Connolly, 1993). Figures were prepared by using PyMOL (DeLano, 2002) or GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). Difference distance matrices were produce by distance sorting C positions and plotting with the program DDMP (Fleming, 2004). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Proteins were gel filtration purified (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed in PBS buffer (10 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl [pH 7.4]). Experiments were conducted on a MicroCal VP-ITC at 37°C, and data were analyzed with Origin software (MicroCal). Core YU2 (1.5­24 M) and V1/V2 YU2 (1.0­6.5 M) were titrated with CD4, CD4M33, F23, or 17b Fab by using 20­30 injections of 5­10 l per injection. Mimetic concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm based on extinction coefficients calculated from the protein sequences. Neutralization Assay and Data Analysis Viral assays testing the neutralization capacity of CD4, CD4M33, and F23 were carried out as described previously (Wei et al., 2003). Protein sequences were used to build a phylogenetic tree by using the parsimony method as implemented in PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 2004).
