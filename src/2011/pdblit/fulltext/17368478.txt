Abstract Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds the 5PP cap of eukaryotic mRNAs and overexpression of eIF4E in epithelial cell cancers correlates with the metastases/tissue invasion phenotype. Photolabeling of eIF4E with [Q-32 P]8Q azidoguanosine 5P-triphosphate (8-N3 GTP) demonstrated crossP linking at Lys-119 in the S4^H2 loop which is distant from the m7 GTP binding site [Marcotrigiano et al. (1997) Cell 89, 951^ 961; Friedland et al. (1997) Protein Sci. 6, 125^131]. Modeling studies indicate that 8-N3 GTP cross-linked with Lys-119 because it binds a site that is occupied by the second nucleotide of a bound mRNA. Mutagenesis of the S4^H2 loop produced proteins with a 5^10-fold higher affinity for m7 GTP than wild-type eIF4E. These mutants of eIF4E may have uses in selectively purifying mRNAs with intact 5P-ends or in determining how the promyelocytic P leukemia protein decreases the affinity of eIF4E for mRNA caps. ß 2002 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Regulation of gene expression at the level of translation occurs in many biological processes including cell growth and di¡erentiation, embryonic development, and viral infection. Evidence is accumulating that perturbations in mRNA translational elements play a major role in the biology of some cancers [3^7]. In addition, at least one small molecule anti-cancer agent is believed to exert its e¡ect by inhibiting initiation of mRNA translation [8]. A critical protein mediating early events in initiation of translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). eIF4E serves as an intermediary between the 5P-cap (m7 G(5P)ppp(5P)N), several other initiation factors plus the poly(A) binding protein (PAB), and the 3Ppoly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNA [9,10]. It has a binding site

for m7 GDP on one side and a binding site for eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) (or PHAS-I) on the other side of its central L-sheet [1,11,12]. eIF4E is part of the eIF4F complex that includes eIF4G, which binds ribosomes and PAB, and eIF4A, which is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase [13]. The binding of eIF4F and eIF4B to the mRNA cap appears to be a key step in the ATP-dependent unwinding of mRNA structure and ribosome binding which are rate limiting events for the translational initiation of many eukaryotic mRNAs [14]. eIF4E and assembly of the eIF4F complex are targets of regulation during the stimulation of cell growth and di¡erentiation [15^17]. In addition, overexpression or microinjection of eIF4E causes malignant transformation in NIH 3T3 cells and aberrant growth in HeLa cells [18,19]. Elevated levels of eIF4E mRNA and protein are found in a variety of epithelial cell cancers [3,5]. The binding of eIF4E to eIF4G is regulated by interactions with translational repressor proteins which sequester eIF4E for release under selected physiological conditions [20,21]. On the other hand, eIF4E- and eIF4E-associated proteins are targeted during growth inhibitory events. For example, during apoptosis at least one eIF4E-associated protein is targeted for proteolytic destruction [22]. In addition, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) which inhibits cell transformation and growth has recently been shown to bind eIF4E and decrease the a/nity for mRNA caps [23,24]. The structure of a cocrystal of mammalian eIF4E bound to m7 GDP and the structure of yeast eIF4E bound to m7 GDP in solution have been solved [1,11,12]. Both studies describe a cap binding slot for eIF4E in which the m7 G moiety is sandwiched between the side chains of two tryptophans, Trp-56/ Trp-102 in mammalian and Trp-58/Trp-104 in yeast eIF4E. Mutagenesis studies of the m7 GDP binding site of eIF4E support the hypothesized Z^Z stacking that occurs between the m7 G moiety and the two tryptophan residues [25]. In addition, several residues interact with m7 G by hydrogen bonding. These include Trp-166 in mammalian and yeast, as well as Glu-103 in mammalian, and Glu-105 in yeast eIF4E which form hydrogen bonds with m7 G [1,11]. The results of speci¢c photoa/nity labeling of recombinant mammalian eIF4E with [Q-32 P]8-azidoguanosine 5P-triphosphate (8-N3 GTP) suggested that residues near Lys-119, the site of photoinsertion, interacted with this nucleotide probe [2]. We report a molecular model built with the coordinates of eIF4E/m7 GDP cocrystal structure and its use to identify

T. Spivak-Kroizman et al./FEBS Letters 516 (2002) 9^14 measured on a Jasco-J710 spectropolarimeter [29,30]. Spectra were obtained in a 0.1 M phosphate bu¡er at pH 7.6. All measurements were performed using a 0.5 mm pathlength quartz cell at 25C. Each sample was scanned 10 times and high frequency noise reduction was applied. Data were recorded at 0.5 mm intervals with a time constant of 1.0 s and a 1.0 nm constant spectral bandwidth. 2.5. Fluorescence measurements of the Kd of eIF4E for m7 GTP Fluorescence titration experiments were performed to determine the Kd of m7 GTP binding to wild-type and mutant eIF4E. The bu¡er used for all £uorescence measurements was 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6) and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Measurements were performed at 25C on a SPEX Fluorolog-T2 spectro£uorometer equipped with a high intensity (450 W) xenon arc lamp. An excitation wavelength of 289 nm was used to monitor the tryptophan £uorescence emission of the proteins. Excitation and emission slit widths of 1.5 and 2.0 mm, respectively, were used and a 1.0 cm sample cell path length was employed. The steady state data were collected and analyzed as described previously [29,31].

possible binding sites for the [Q-32 P]8-N3 GTP probe on the surface of eIF4E near the S4^H2 (N118^Q120) loop. The site of cross-linking of the nucleotide probe, the S4^H2 loop, was analyzed by mutagenizing residues Asn-118 through Gln-121 to alanine and determining the e¡ect on 4E functions. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Modeling of the capped mRNA binding site of eIF4E The eIF4E structure was studied to determine the possible binding site of [Q-32 P]8-N3 GTP ([1,2], PDB ID# 1EJ1, 1EJ4, 1EJH). The program DOCK was run on the apo-protein structure (eIF4E without m7 GDP present) to locate potential mRNA binding sites on the protein surface [25]. First, cavities were located on the protein surface by î probing with a sphere equivalent to H2 O (1.4 A). A cavity is de¢ned by a cluster of spheres which are in contact and are complementary to a pocket in the molecular surface of the protein. More than 20 cavities were located on the surface of eIF4E. Three interconnected cavities localized near the site of m7 GDP in the cocrystal structure were searched for nucleotide binding sites. When searched with m7 GDP î as the ligand, DOCK located a m7 GDP binding site within 1.5 A of the m7 GDP bound in the cocrystal structure. Next GMP was used as the ligand to search for other possible mRNA binding sites because it is a single repeating unit of RNA. An atomic match of GMP to a subset of spheres within a cavity de¢ned a potential nucleotide binding site. All potential GMP binding sites were located and sorted to identify those which positioned the ribose and phosphate of the base in an appropriate orientation to form growing RNA chains of three nucleotides from a m7 GDP moiety which was ¢xed as in the cocrystal structure [1]. Two initial mRNA conformations formed using this approach were submitted as ligands in £exible docking runs onto the apo-eIF4E structure using SYBYL FlexiDock [26]. The m7 GDP cap was held ¢xed within the determined binding site, the protein molecule was held ¢xed, and the remainder of the RNA tail was allowed to £ex and rotate. These studies formed the basis for the hypothesized location of an mRNA bound to eIF4E. 2.2. Mutagenesis of eIF4E Wild-type eIF4Ehuman in a pET-3d vector was used as a template for QuikChange1 PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) [25,27]. Mutagenesis primer oligonucleotides were designed to introduce alanine substitutions at residues N118, K119, Q120, and Q121, and used according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. All plasmids were sequenced (both strands of the eIF4E coding region) to con¢rm mutagenesis. The nomenclature of mutants indicates the substituted amino acid, its position, and the replacing residue (e.g. lysine at position 119 replaced by alanine is designated K119A). 2.3. Expression and puri¢cation of eIF4E mutants and PHAS-I Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expressing wild-type or mutants of eIF4Ehuman were grown at 37C in M9ZB media containing ampicillin. Cells were induced at an OD600 of 0.6 with 0.4 mM IPTG and incubated for an additional 3 h. Wild-type and mutant proteins were puri¢ed from these cultures as previously described [27]. PHAS-I was expressed and puri¢ed as described elsewhere [28]. The PHAS-I expression vector and rabbit anti-PHAS-I antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. J.C. Lawrence [28]. 2.4.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Modeling studies of 8-N3 GTP binding to eIF4E Previous studies have shown that an 8-N3 GTP photoprobe speci¢cally bound to mammalian eIF4E and that the site of cross-linking was Lys-119 [2]. Modeling studies were done with the coordinates of the eIF4E/m7 GDP cocrystal to identify the most likely surface cavity that bound the 8-N3 GTP probe. They demonstrated that it was highly improbable that the photoprobe bound to the m7 GDP binding site in the cocrystal structure [1]. In the eIF4E/m7 GDP cocrystal structure the m7 GDP binding site covers the edge of the central L-sheet (strands 1, 3, and 5) [1]. Lys-119 is at the end of strand 4 which is two strands away from the m7 GDP binding site at a î distance of approximately 19^20 A. The side chain of Lys-119 could not extend this distance in the model to interact with 8N3 GTP in the m7 GDP binding site (between Trp-56 and Trp102), and since Lys-119 is one residue o¡ the end of a L-strand in the center of the sheet, the backbone surrounding position 119 could not extend to allow this interaction. Moreover, other lysine residues that were on £exible loop structures line the m7 GDP binding site (Lys-49, Lys-52, and Lys-54 in the 1^2 loop and Lys-106 in the 3^4 loop) and were more likely candidates to cross-link with 8-N3 GTP bound in the m7 GDP binding site [1]. Based on the modeling studies we conclude that 8-N3 GTP did not bind eIF4E in the m7 GDP site formed by the S1^S2 and S3^S4 loops. If the 8-N3 GTP photoprobe did not bind in the m7 GDP binding site then what site on eIF4E would speci¢cally bind this nucleotide? Modeling suggests that in order to interact with Lys-119, the 8-N3 GTP probe bound to sites that we hypothesize bind the second and third nucleotides of a bound mRNA (Fig. 1B). GMP was used as the ligand to probe the apo-protein structure of eIF4E with the program DOCK (see

The L-strands are colored yellow and labeled as previously de¢ned [1]. The S4^H2 loop (extending from strand 4; residues 118^121) is colored red. The positions of side chains of Lys-159 and Ser-209 are labeled in white. Lys-119 was modeled, labeled and displayed (capped sticks, represented by atom color with carbons being green).

Only GMP molecules which orient the ribose and phosphate in the 5P to 3P direction toward the m7 G cap are shown. Note that two di¡erent potential binding sites for the fourth nucleotide are shown (lower left of the panel). B: The preferred mRNA position, as determined by modeling, is shown. The m7 Gpp present in the eIF4E/ m7 GDP cocrystal structure is shown in space ¢ll. The second, third, and fourth nucleotides of the modeled mRNA (m7 GpppGGG) are shown in magenta. The location of this modeled mRNA binding site is consistent with the proposed path of a capped mRNA [1], and the solution structure of yeast eIF4E with bound m7 GpppA [11]. The second nucleotide binds between Ser-209 and Lys-159, while the third and fourth nucleotides pack along the edge of the cavity demarcated by Lys-159 and Lys-119.

Fig. 2. Puri¢cation of eIF4E mutants. Expression and puri¢cation of all mutants of eIF4E was performed as described in Section 2. The recombinant proteins recovered from the ¢nal FPLC puri¢cation step were analyzed by 12% SDS^PAGE. A Coomassie bluestained gel with 30 Wg of each eIF4E mutant is shown.

Section 2) and the binding sites were clustered within the predicted path of an mRNA [1] (Fig. 1A). The bound GMP molecules were then linked to form RNA chains (m7 GpppGGG) and minimized using FlexiDock. The predicted mRNA conformations packed in one of two binding channels. The 5P-m7 Gpp moiety and second nucleotide of each RNA were bound in identical positions. The most favored site packed nucleotides 3 and 4 along the edge of the cavity that is demarcated by Lys-119 and Lys-159 (Fig. 1B). Regarding the second, third, and fourth nucleotides of the modeled bound mRNA, the phosphate-ribose backbone and not the bases interacted with the L-sheet of eIF4E. This mode of binding has been observed in the cocrystal structure of VP39, a vaccinia virus protein that has cap-dependent 2P-Omethyltransferase activity, with an m7 G capped oligoribonu-

cleotide which permits the protein to bind RNA in a sequence-non-speci¢c manner [32,33]. The orientation of a bound RNA in VP-39 and that predicted for eIF4E is di¡erent from the RNA recognition motif described for RNPs that speci¢cally bind U series RNAs [34,35]. RNPs contain solvent-exposed aromatic residues on the interior L-sheet, which stack with bases of the bound RNA in a manner that is not base speci¢c. Such aromatic residues are not seen in the L-sheet region forming the RNA binding site of eIF4E. Instead, positively charged residues (Lys, Arg) are present on this surface, suggesting that it interacts with the phosphate backbone of a bound RNA. Using the modeled mRNA and allowing £exibility of the C1^N9 bond of guanine bases and the chi1 and chi2 bonds of Lys-119, the hydrogen on C8 of the 5P-m7 G cap, of G2, and î î î of G3 was 20 A, 5 A, and 5 A away from the epsilon nitrogen of Lys-119, respectively. This suggests that Lys-119 could not cross-link with 8-N3 GTP bound in the m7 GDP cap site without extensive rearrangements of the protein structure, yet could readily cross-link with a N3 GDP bound in the second (or third) nucleotide binding site of the model with only slight shifts in the S4^H2 loop and the S5^6 loop (Fig. 1B). Such structural shifts were implied in the di¡erences seen in the crystal structure of the S5^6 loop observed in the two di¡erent asymmetric units solved [1]. The location of the modeled mRNA binding site is consistent with the path of a capped mRNA bound to mammalian eIF4E and the solution structure of yeast eIF4E with m7 GpppA (Fig. 1B) [1,11]. The capped mRNA extends from Trp-56/Trp-102 (Trp-58/Trp-104 in yeast) and travels through the concave surface of the L-sheet. The fact that m7 GTP was able to speci¢cally compete with photocross-linking of the 8-N3 GTP probe is most likely due to competition at the level of the 3P-phosphates rather than competition between the purine ring moieties [2]. Because of the 5P^5P linkage of the mRNA cap, the phosphates of each NTP would be facing the

Fig. 3. Measurements of the fraction of protein bound as a function of m7 GTP concentrations were performed for wild-type eIF4E and K119A. All measurements were done in 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6) and 1 mM DTT, at 23C and at a protein concentration of 1 WM. An excitation wavelength of 289 nm was used to monitor the £uorescence intensity at 330 nm. The symbols represent (b) wild-type and (a) K119A eIF4E.

phosphates of 8-N3 GTP and would compete for the same binding site (Fig. 1B). Thus as the experiments showed, the photolabeling of 8-N3 GTP was most e¡ectively inhibited by capped mRNA (95%), m7 GTP (84%), GTP (79%), and GDP (74%) while photolabeling was inhibited only slightly by GMP (27%) [2]. 3.2. Expression and puri¢cation of eIF4E mutants To further study the site identi¢ed by photoa/nity labeling, we mutagenized the S4^H2 loop. Four eIF4E mutants were produced with residues N118, K119, Q120, or Q121 mutated to alanine. Wild-type and mutants of eIF4E were expressed in E. coli and milligram quantities of proteins were puri¢ed (see Section 2). Analysis of the puri¢ed mutants of eIF4E by SDS^ PAGE demonstrated greater than 90% purity (Fig. 2). The yields for both wild-type and mutant eIF4E were between 1 and 2 mg of puri¢ed protein per liter of E. coli culture. Characterization of the eIF4E mutants indicated that mutagenesis did not disrupt several functions. Mutant proteins with residues 118^121 changed to alanine were able to bind m7 GTP Sepharose and had circular dichroism spectra that were similar to wild-type eIF4E (data not shown). In addition, their ability to bind the translational repressor protein PHAS-I was not altered as determined by co-immunoprecipitating the two proteins with anti-eIF4E serum (not shown). 3.3. A/nity of eIF4E mutants for m7 GTP The preparation of relatively large quantities of recombinant eIF4E mutants permitted their Kd of binding to the mRNA cap structure to be directly determined. Quantitation was performed by measuring the £uorescence quenching of intrinsic tryptophan residues in eIF4E upon m7 GTP binding at 25C. The Kd value of recombinant wild-type eIF4E for m7 GTP was 1.2 WM and is similar to that reported for the native protein [29,31]. While Q121A had a Kd for m7 GTP that was similar to wild-type eIF4E (Kd of 1.1 and 1.2 WM, respectively), the N118A, K119A, and Q120A mutants all had signi¢cantly higher binding a/nities with a Kd of 6 0.30 WM for m7 GTP. Substituting residues in strand 4 of eIF4E with alanine produced no mutants with similar increases in their af¢nity for m7 GTP (not shown). The quenching curves for wildtype eIF4E and K119A are shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the N118A, K119A, and Q120A mutants of eIF4E did not show an ionic strength dependence for m7 GTP binding as is the case for wild-type eIF4E [29]. The interaction between eIF4E and mRNA caps is an essential and regulated step of gene expression. We provide evidence that speci¢c mutations that are distant to the m7 GTP binding site of eIF4E can increase the a/nity of m7 GTP binding. The N118A, K119A, and Q120A mutants of eIF4E provide novel examples of isoforms of eIF4E which have an a/nity for m7 GTP that is up to one order of magnitude higher than wild-type eIF4E. All of these mutations are located in the S4^H2 loop. One possible explanation for the observed increased a/nity for m7 GTP would be minor modi¢cations in the position or orientation of the tryptophan residues, located in the S1^S2 (W56) and S3^S4 (W102) loops, which Z^Z stack with the m7 G moiety of mRNA [1,25]. It will be interesting to eventually determine if the mechanism(s) involved share similarities with or are di¡erent than those explaining the decreased a/nity of mRNA cap binding that occurs when PML binds eIF4E [23,24]. Current e¡orts are being aimed

at determining if the high a/nity mutants of eIF4E may have practical use in improving methods of isolating mRNA with intact 5P-ends [36]. A better understanding of the reason for the increased a/nity of these mutants for m7 GTP may permit eIF4E to be further engineered for speci¢c purposes.
