Background: The capsid protein (CA) of retroviruses, such as Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), consists of two independently folded domains. CA functions as part of a polyprotein during particle assembly and budding and, in addition, forms a shell encapsidating the genomic RNA in the mature, infectious virus. Results: The structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of RSV CA have been determined by X-ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, respectively. The N-terminal domain comprises seven  helices and a short  hairpin at the N terminus. The N-terminal domain associates through a small, tightly packed, twofold symmetric interface within the crystal, different from those previously described for other retroviral CAs. The C-terminal domain is a compact bundle of four  helices, although the last few residues are disordered. In dilute solution, RSV CA is predominantly monomeric. We show, however, using electron microscopy, that intact RSV CA can assemble in vitro to form both tubular structures constructed from toroidal oligomers and planar monolayers. Both modes of assembly occur under similar solution conditions, and both sheets and tubes exhibit long-range order. Conclusions: The tertiary structure of CA is conserved across the major retroviral genera, yet sequence variations are sufficient to cause change in associative behavior. CA forms the exterior shell of the viral core in all mature retroviruses. However, the core morphology differs between viruses. Consistent with this observation, we find that the capsid proteins of RSV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 exhibit different associative behavior in dilute solution and assemble in vitro into different structures.

Introduction
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is a tumor-generating avian retrovirus. Following its isolation in 1911, it has become one of the most thoroughly studied retroviruses. These viruses are dependent on RNA-directed DNA synthesis for the establishment of infection, via the process of reverse transcription. They are the causative agents of cancer and immune disorders in many species. All retroviruses possess a gene (gag), which encodes the major structural proteins of the virion. The gag gene is translated as a polyprotein, which directs the formation and release of spherical viral particles. During or after budding of the virus, the Gag polyprotein is cleaved by the viral protease, generating the internal structural proteins found in the infectious retrovirus. These include the proteins MA (matrix), CA (capsid), and NC (nucleocapsid). Proteolytic cleavage is associated with a structural rearrangement of the virus, termed maturation. The most dramatic structural change seen in the maturing retrovirus

is the formation of the viral core, a large assemblage in which a shell of CA encapsidates the genomic RNA and the replicative enzymes of the virus. Within the capsid, NC associates tightly with the RNA, forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which is the template for reverse transcription. The retroviral core is delivered into the cytoplasm of the host cell during the initial stages of infection. There has been rapid progress in structural studies of the individual components of retroviruses (for reviews focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) see [1,2]). Much less is known about the interaction of these components within the virion and the regulation of retroviral assembly and maturation. This paper focuses on the retroviral capsid protein, a molecule comprising two loosely associated, predominantly  helical domains. Structures of the nearly full-length capsid protein, or of the individual domains, have been reported for HIV-1 [3­8], equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) [9], and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [10]. These results,

obtained using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, show that there can be large variations in the relative positions of the two domains, with few or no interactions between them [5,7,9,10]. The C-terminal domain contains the most highly conserved amino acid sequence within the retroviral Gag protein, a stretch of 20 residues termed the major homology region (MHR). Although the role of this region is unknown, an essential function in viral replication is implied by its evolutionary conservation in otherwise widely diverged sequences. This supposition has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis [11,12]. In the immature virion, CA is embedded within the Gag polyprotein. All immature retroviruses have a similar supramolecular organization. The Gag proteins are arranged radially, with the N termini facing the viral membrane and the C termini in the interior of the particle. Retroviruses are heterogeneous in size and lack any overall symmetry [2]. Although CA forms the exterior shell of the viral core in all mature retroviruses, the core morphology differs among these viruses. The core in HIV-1 and other lentiviruses (e.g. EIAV) has a predominantly conical appearance. The cores of other retroviruses, however, such as RSV (cryo-EM unpublished observations) and murine leukemia virus (MLV), resemble irregular polyhedra. The sequence immediately downstream of CA is important in directing immature particle formation in RSV and also during maturation of the virus [13]. The proteolytic processing that occurs at the C terminus of CA has been studied in both RSV [14,15] and HIV-1 [16,17]. In both of these retroviruses, CA is separated from the downstream NC by a short amino acid sequence, termed the spacer peptide (SP in RSV, and SP1 or p2 in HIV-1). The spacer is 12 amino acids long in RSV and 14 amino acids long in HIV-1 (with some variation among different isolates). In RSV, deletions of all, or part, of SP do not block particle assembly or release. All such mutants are non-infectious, however, with the resulting particles exhibiting increased size heterogeneity and a reduced stability of the viral core [13,14]. In HIV-1, most studies have shown that deletions or point mutations in this region also result in morphologically aberrant particles of heterogeneous size [16]. Cleavage at the N terminus of the spacer peptide is much slower than cleavage at its C terminus, and an intermediate species CA SP (CA SP1 in HIV-1) transiently accumulates and disappears during the maturation process [15]. We initiated structural studies on RSV CA to help understand the role of CA and the spacer peptide in viral assembly. Crystals of this protein have been described previously, in which the molecule is arranged in pseudohelical fashion [18]. Although the interactions of CA within these crystals might mimic those found in vivo, the

crystallography is not straightforward, partly because of crystal disorder. In this paper, we report independent structure determinations of the two domains of RSV CA; the N-terminal domain by X-ray crystallography and the C-terminal domain and spacer peptide by solution NMR spectroscopy. Results of in vitro assembly studies on intact CA are also presented.

Results and discussion
The N-terminal domain of RSV CA

Domain structure, the role of the  hairpin, and interactions within the crystal

X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.05 Å resolution from crystals of the N-terminal domain of CA (residues 1­154) (Table 1). Phases to 2.7 Å resolution were experimentally determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) methods. The crystal space group is P212121, with two copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit. One of the molecules undergoes relatively large displacements from its mean position within the crystal lattice, and the electron density for this copy is less resolved. The crystallographic R factors for the final refined model were 24.7% (Rwork) and 27.1% (Rfree). The last eight residues of both CA1­154 molecules are disordered and have not been modeled. Comparison with structures of HIV-1 and EIAV CA [7,9] shows that these residues form the flexible linker between the two domains of the intact protein.

The N-terminal domain comprises seven  helices, together with a short  hairpin at the N terminus, and is similar to that found in other retroviral CAs (Figure 1). The least conserved region within CA is found between the fourth and last helices of the domain (the top left of the molecule in Figure 1), where corresponding helices vary significantly in both length and orientation in the four known structures (RSV, HIV-1, HTLV-1, EIAV). This region encompasses the flexible, proline-rich, cyclophilinA binding loop found in HIV-1 CA. The  hairpin in RSV CA (amino acids 1­12) projects away from the main body of the domain and is anchored in place at the N terminus by a salt bridge between the charged N-terminal proline residue and a buried aspartic acid (Figure 1). In this, it closely resembles HIV-1 CA, in which the hairpin (amino acids 1­13) is held in place by equivalent interactions [3­5]. In the better defined copy of RSV CA1­154, the electron density for the  hairpin is readily interpretable. In the second copy of this molecule, there is no interpretable electron density for amino acids 6­8, the most distal part of the hairpin. This structural element seems to be quite mobile in both RSV and HIV-1 [3,4,19]. The conservation of the  hairpin among retroviral CAs has been widely anticipated; however, RSV is only the second retrovirus in which this has been experimentally demonstrated. In structure determinations of EIAV and HTLV-1 CA [9,10], the molecules studied did not have wild-type sequences at the N terminus, and the structure of this region was not resolved. The N-terminal  hairpin, as seen in RSV and HIV-1 CA, can only completely form after proteolysis of the Gag precursor. In HIV-1, it was proposed, largely on the basis of crystallographic results [3], that structural rearrangement at the N terminus following proteolysis allows formation of a new CA­CA interface, facilitating assembly of the capsid in the maturing virus [3,4]. The N-terminal proline, and its bonding partner (aspartic acid or glutamic acid), are conserved among highly diverged retroviral sequences, suggesting that similar events occur in almost all retroviruses. Hence, it was hypothesized that the N terminus of CA functioned as a `conformational switch' responsible for redirecting assembly of CA in the mature virion. This concept is supported by the in vitro assembly studies on purified viral components, although results for HIV-1 [20] and RSV [21] were not entirely consistent. The recent observation that truncated HIV-1 Gag proteins with an `immature' CA N terminus can be assembled into either tubes (resembling the mature core) or spheres (resembling the immature virion), depending upon solution pH [22], indicates that the switching hypothesis is probably oversimplified. It is not clear to what extent the structure at the N terminus of mature CA is formed within the Gag polyprotein. The  hairpin must be at least transiently disrupted to allow access to the viral protease and, hence,

must fold in a semi-autonomous fashion. The N-terminal proline in RSV is followed in the sequence by three -branched amino acids (Val­Val­Ile), which have a high intrinsic propensity for  sheet formation [23]. This might help direct the formation and stabilization of the hairpin. More generally, there is a strong preference for -branched amino acids at positions 2 and 3 in the sequences of all retroviral CAs. The two noncrystallographically related copies of the protein interact through a tightly packed interface, arising from the parallel association of the fourth helix of the domain (Figure 2). The interface exhibits almost perfect twofold rotational symmetry (the two molecules involved are related by a rotation of 178°, with a translation of 0.2 Å along the symmetry axis). Residues at the core of the interface are hydrophobic, but the area of interaction is small, with the molecular surface area of each of the interacting domains reduced by only 1.9% (250 Å2). The domain interaction is mediated by an octahedrally coordinated metal ion (probably Mg2+, which was present at high concentration in the crystallization medium). The metal ion is bound to Asp71 in each molecule and to four coplanar water molecules. This interface is different from the twofold symmetric interfaces previously reported for the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 CA in complex with a monoclonal antibody fragment [5] or with cyclophilin A [3]. The N-terminal  hairpin is found on the exterior of the complex and is not involved in interface formation (Figure 2). This interface could be one of several interactions involved in assembly of the immature or mature particle.
The C-terminal domain of RSV CA

Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy

We overexpressed two constructs in Escherichia coli, encompassing the C-terminal domain of CA, and studied them by solution NMR spectroscopy. Both start at residue 155 of CA and contain, in addition to the wild-type sequence, an initiating methionine. Evaluation of the probable domain boundary was made on the basis of proteolysis experiments on HIV-1 CA [4], coupled with alignment of the HIV-1 and RSV CA sequences. Recent structural studies suggest that the flexible polypeptide linking the N- and C-terminal domains begins several residues upstream [7,9,10]. The first construct (CA155­237) ends at Ala237, which is the C terminus of the predominant variant of mature RSV CA [15]. The second construct (CA155­249) ends at Met249, hence including both the C-terminal domain of CA and the spacer peptide. The constructs show no apparent self-association in dilute solution, as monitored by size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). This is consistent with results for the intact protein, which behaves in a similar fashion (see below). The four  helices of the C-terminal domain were readily identified by analysis of their chemical shifts [24] and by

The boundaries of the helices within the N-terminal domain of RSV CA are: helix 1, 15­30; 2, 33­44; 3, 49­61; 4, 62­87; 5, 102­107; 6, 116­124; 7, 125­147.

characteristic patterns of short and medium range nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs). The final helix terminates at Arg225. In both the shorter and longer constructs, there are no significant chemical shift deviations from random coil values beyond Pro230. Addition of the spacer peptide to the C terminus of CA slightly perturbs the NMR chemical shifts of the last seven residues (amino

acids 230­237) and results in chemical shift heterogeneity, beginning at Pro230. Instead of a single resonance associated with each nucleus, more than one was often observed, although they all clustered around random coil values. The chemical shift heterogeneity is most probably because of cis­trans isomerization of Pro230 and Pro246. There is an almost complete absence of inter-residual

Solution structure of the C-terminal domain

NOEs in the region C-terminal to Pro230, whether or not the spacer peptide is present. The magnitudes of the steady-state heteronuclear 1H­15N NOEs were measured to study the mainchain flexibility. The steady-state 1H­15N NOE is highly sensitive to reorientation of the 1H­15N bond vector, with negative, or small positive, NOE values being indicative of fast motion relative to the overall tumbling rate of the molecule. In the shorter construct, the heteronuclear NOEs for the backbone amide groups start to decrease sharply at Arg225, and beyond residue 230 they become negative. The same pattern is exhibited in the longer construct with none of the residues in the spacer peptide exhibiting large positive heteronuclear NOEs. These results indicate that the C terminus of CA and the spacer peptide (residues 230­249) do not possess any persistent secondary or tertiary structure and are flexible in solution. Deletion of the spacer

The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain (residues 155­230) was determined from NOEderived distance restraints, together with 3-bond J-coupling measurements and chemical shift data (see the Materials and methods section). The minimized average structure agrees well with the experimental restraints (Table 2) and has 88% of the amino acids in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot. The four  helices of the C-terminal domain form a compact bundle (Figure 3). The N-terminal residues (155­159) have an extended conformation and pack against the first helix of the domain. The MHR encompasses this N-terminal extended strand, the subsequent  turn and much of the first helix. Several of the invariantly conserved amino acids within the MHR are involved in formation of the  turn. Critical to the integrity of this region is a glutamine residue (Gln158 in RSV) that functions as a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, bridging the N terminus of helix 1 and the C terminus of helix 2. All tested mutations of this residue in RSV disrupt particle assembly and abolish viral replication [12] (T Cairns and R Craven, unpublished observations). A conservative substitution of the equivalent residue in HIV-1 has a similar effect [11]. Most other elements of the associated hydrogen bonding

622

Structure 2000, Vol 8 No 6

network within HIV-1 [6] are present in RSV. It has not been possible to fully define the sidechain conformation of Arg170, which is completely conserved among CA sequences. Nonetheless, there are several indications that this residue adopts a fixed position within the structure (see Materials and methods). The hydrophobic residues within the MHR are found on the interior face of the first helix. Given the potential for compensatory mutations within the hydrophobic core of most proteins, the reason for their conservation remains uncertain.
The spacer peptide appears unstructured: implications for assembly and maturation

The lack of persistent structure at the C terminus of RSV CA and within the spacer peptide is consistent with studies on other retroviral CAs. The last 8­10 amino acids of the HIV-1 and EIAV CAs are disordered in X-ray crystal structures [6­9], and NMR spectroscopy shows that this region lacks structure in HTLV-1 CA [10]. For HIV-1, one of the proteins studied encompassed both the C-terminal domain and the spacer peptide SP1 [8]; however, SP1 was found to be disordered within the crystal. Although a helix overlapping the CA SP1 boundary in HIV-1 has been predicted [16], no direct experimental evidence exists in support of this hypothesis. It is unclear if these observations can be related directly to the situation in vivo. Proteolytic cleavage might be associated with conformational change, thereby causing the structure of the mature proteins, or transiently observed intermediates, to differ from that embedded in the polyprotein precursor. Within the immature virus, lateral interactions between the Gag polyprotein, mediated by
Figure 3

nucleic acid binding, will confine the polypeptide chain at the CA­NC boundary to a very restricted volume, potentially influencing structure in this region. Nevertheless, there is little evidence to suggest that the spacer peptide needs to be structured to fulfill its role in viral assembly and maturation. The assembly of immature particles is a robust process, and the Gag polyprotein in some retroviruses is known to include domains that are unstructured in vitro [1]. During maturation, the removal of the spacer peptide from the C terminus of CA appears essential for proper condensation of CA around the RNP complex in RSV and HIV-1 [14,16,17]. The presence of a long, flexible extension at the C terminus of CA, however, could block capsid assembly through a simple steric mechanism. The majority of retroviruses possess a spacer peptide which separates mature CA and NC; however, it varies widely in length and composition, ranging from five amino acids in EIAV to 25 amino acids in bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). In several retroviruses (RSV, HIV-1, BIV), there are multiple cleavage sites within the spacer peptide. Some retroviruses (mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and MLV) lack a spacer peptide altogether. It, therefore, seems unlikely that the spacer peptide has a completely defined and invariant structure in HIV-1 or in any other retrovirus.
Intermolecular association and the C-terminal domain

Structures of retroviral CAs have not fully clarified the pathway or outcome of viral assembly. The CA­CA interactions within the immature and mature virus might be quite different, as suggested, for example, by crosslinking studies on MLV [25]. The study of capsid

(b) This figure displays the same information as in (a) but the domains have been rotated by 180° so that the reverse face of the molecule is visible. For clarity, the N terminus has been truncated at an equivalent point in each structure (Asp155 in RSV, Asp152 in HIV-1, Asn152 in EIAV, Ser135 in HTLV-1). Several residues N-terminal to this position should be considered part of the C-terminal domain and are potentially involved in domain association [6,8]. Ribbon diagrams were prepared using the program Ribbons 2.0 [50], and molecular surfaces were calculated and displayed using the programs MSMS and MSV [53]. Vertices of the triangulated surface were colored by the property of the closest atom. The Protein Data Bank accession codes of the structural models used to generate the figure are 1a43 (HIV-1 [8]), 1eia (EIAV [9]), 1qrj (HTLV-1 [10]).

condensation in the maturing virus is further complicated by the transitory nature of the interactions involved, the potential for cooperative association of the two flexibly linked domains of CA, and the irregularity of the authentic viral core. The C-terminal domain of HIV-1 CA (the `dimerization domain' [6,8]) is responsible for the self-association of this protein in dilute solution. The X-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 CA shows that the dimer interface is built around the parallel packing of helix 2 across a twofold rotation axis [6,8]. A similar, but not identical, interaction is seen in a crystal structure of EIAV CA [9]. This dimer might be an intermediate in the capsid assembly pathway, such as occur during assembly of some icosahedral viruses.

The molecular surface of the C-terminal domain of CA is displayed for RSV, and for three other retroviruses, in Figure 4. On the front face of the domain (Figure 4a), a hydrophobic surface patch associated with the N terminus of helix 2 is relatively conserved, consistent with its persistent involvement in the domain interactions seen crystallographically [6­9]. On the reverse face of the domain (Figure 4b), there is another hydrophobic surface patch, which is of largest extent in RSV. The predominant contribution to this region is made by residues within the first and fourth helices of the domain, and its size suggests that it could be involved in intermolecular association. Although the burial of nonpolar residues might drive protein­protein association, the complementarity of the interacting regions will dictate the specific result. Changing the solution pH can profoundly affect the outcome of

1000 µm [10]. In contrast, HIV-1 CA dimerizes with an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd = 10­30 µM, with dimerization apparently mediated by the C-terminal domain alone [6]. The structures of the two independently folded domains of RSV CA, and the behavior of CA in dilute solution [11], give few indications how the molecule might interact to form higher-order structures. Consequently, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to study the in vitro assembly of CA. Intact CA (2­10 mg/ml) assembles into regular structures at mildly acidic pH, in the presence of 0.6­1.1 M NaCl. The in vitro assembly of HIV-1 CA to form tubular structures occurs under similar conditions [26,27]. At these concentrations, the salt acts to reduce protein solubility. Two types of higher-order assembly were observed at such conditions (Figure 5). Most commonly, large planar arrays formed, spanning thousands of nanometers. The edges of these arrays are often curled up to form partially closed tubes with a varying external diameter of ~90 nm. The planar sheets were ordered, with Fourier transformation of images giving rise to discrete peaks, arranged on a regular lattice. The diffraction pattern can be indexed on a hexagonal lattice (approximate cell dimensions a = b = 9.1 nm,  = 60°) or, alternatively, on a `centered' rectangular lattice (approximate cell dimensions a = 9.0 nm, b = 15.9 nm,  = 90°). Diffraction from well-preserved negatively stained arrays extends to approximately 25 Å resolution. Filtered images of untilted, negatively stained arrays possess approximate C2mm plane group symmetry. This would arise in projection if the layer group of the crystal was C222. This tentative layer group assignment implies that there are twofold symmetric interfaces that mediate the formation of the array. The second mode of RSV CA assembly was observed more sporadically. In this case, the CA assembled into toroidal oligomers (mean diameter ~20 nm), possessing a stain-accessible central cavity (Figure 5). Neither mode of assembly described for RSV CA can exactly represent the situation within the virion, however, because the authentic viral core is a closed, irregular structure, that lacks a fixed geometry.

in vitro assembly studies on purified retroviral components [21,22], and, hence, the protonation state of individual amino acids might be critical to assembly.
Self-association of intact RSV CA

In vitro assembly of RSV CA into regular structures

Size-exclusion chromatography was used to characterize the behavior of intact RSV CA in dilute solution. Protein concentrations up to 780 µm were studied, at near neutral pH, with no change in behavior observed under reducing or oxidizing conditions. Purified CA eluted in a single peak, at a position consistent with a monomeric associative state. As expected for a monomeric species, the elution time did not depend on the concentration of the protein loaded onto the column. An N-terminally truncated HTLV-1 CA is also monomeric at concentrations up to

The in vitro assembly of HIV-1 CA protein into tubular structures has been reported previously [26­28]. These tubes have a variable diameter of 40­50 nm and exhibit long-range order [28,29]. They appear to have a layered architecture, with the N-terminal domain on the outside of the cylinder and the C-terminal domain on the inside [28]. Morphologically similar tubes can be assembled from CA­NC fusion proteins in the presence of nucleic acids. Under suitable solution conditions, these tubes close off

into conical structures that closely resemble the mature core of HIV-1 [22,29]. Similarities in the helical diffraction patterns of the tubular structures, and the viral core, suggest similarities in their internal organization [2]. Thus, for HIV-1 there are clear parallels between the structures assembled in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, two additional modes of assembly have been identified for RSV CA alone. Neither of the resulting structures appears macroscopically similar to the tubes of HIV-1 CA. The planar sheets of RSV CA have rectangular symmetry (tentative layer group assignment C222), whereas HIV-1 CA tubes reportedly possess hexagonal symmetry [29]. The tubular structures of RSV CA, built up from toroidal oligomers, are also dissimilar to the thinwalled hollow tubes of HIV-1 CA.

Both modes of assembly occur at mildly acidic pH in the presence of moderate salt concentrations. Image analysis of the planar sheets, which are the predominant assembly product, suggests that twofold symmetric interactions between domains mediate the formation of this structure. Although the in vitro assembly of HIV-1 CA into tubular structures has been reported previously, these do not macroscopically resemble the sheets or tubes of RSV CA. With in vitro assembly systems for both HIV-1 and RSV CA now described, it might be possible to understand the origin and significance of the different core morphologies of these retroviruses.

Structure determination of the N-terminal domain of RSV CA Protein expression, purification and crystallization
DNA encoding the selected region of the RSV Gag protein (Prague strain C) [30] was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, subcloned into the pET 3xc expression vector (Novagen), and transformed into the BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain of E. coli (Novagen). The expressed protein (CA1­154) comprises the first 154 amino acids of mature CA and has a molecular weight of 16,480 Da. The transformed cells were grown at 37°C in 2YT media, supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 µg/ml). Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the cells harvested 4­5 h after induction. Cells were lysed using a French press. The crude cell lysate was suspended in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer pH 8.0, containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF. Protamine sulfate (final concentration 10 mg/ml) was added to precipitate nucleic acids. Following centrifugation, CA1­154 was purified from the supernatant by size-exclusion chromatography. Superdex 75 preparation and analytical grade columns (Pharmacia) were used sequentially. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced by down-regulation of methionine biosynthesis, using the same vector and host strain. Cells were grown in 2YT media until ready for induction. The cells were spun down, washed, and resuspended in M9 minimal media, supplemented with lysine, threonine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine and isoleucine, all at 100 µg/ml, and selenomethionine at 50 µg/ml. After 30 min growth, the cells were induced and harvested 4­5 h later. The incorporation of selenomethionine was confirmed using matrix-associated laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Crystals of CA1­154 were grown by vapor diffusion methods. Crystallization conditions were identified using experiments based on orthogonal arrays [31]. The protein (20­30 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris/HCL buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl) was equilibrated at 4°C, against a reservoir solution containing 0.15 M Boric acid/KOH buffer, pH 9.1, 16­22% (w/v) PEG 6000, and 0.7 M Mg(NO3)2. It was necessary to use seeding procedures to obtain crystals of a useful size. Crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted protein were prepared in the same fashion. In the latter case, however, it was necessary to include the reducing agent Tris-carboxy ethyl phosphine (TCEP) at a concentration of 1­5 mM in order to prevent protein oxidation. Concentrations of all proteins studied in this paper were measured by spectrophotometric methods. Crystals were transferred to a cryoprotective solution (0.15 M Boric acid/KOH buffer, pH 9.1, 24% (w/v) PEG 6000, 0.7 M Mg(NO 3)2, 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol) and flash frozen in a cold gas stream for X-ray data collection. All diffraction data were collected at 113K. Data integration and scaling were performed with the programs Denzo and Scalepack [32].

Biological implications
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is a tumorigenic avian retrovirus. The emergence of the related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and the resulting world-wide autoimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic, has lent a new urgency to the study of such infectious agents. The RSV capsid protein (CA), like all the internal structural proteins of the virus, is first expressed as part of a polyprotein and is later liberated by the viral protease. CA forms the exterior shell of the viral core, which is delivered into the host cell in the initial stages of infection. The core in RSV resembles an irregular polyhedron, differing from the conical appearance of the core in lentiviruses, such as HIV-1. Despite knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of many retroviral components, the understanding of core architecture and assembly is rudimentary. The structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of RSV CA are presented in this paper and are found to closely resemble those described for other retroviruses. Along with HIV-1, RSV is one of the best characterized molecular genetic systems for the study of retroviruses. Structures of the two domains of CA will be of great importance in interpreting phenotypes resulting from mutagenesis. In common with HIV-1, the N terminus of RSV CA forms a  hairpin, anchored in place by an internal salt bridge. Given that refolding of the N terminus following proteolysis might help direct capsid assembly in the maturing virus, the conservation of this structure across retroviral families is significant and has not been demonstrated previously. The N-terminal domain associates through a twofold symmetric interface within the crystal that does not directly involve the  hairpin. In vitro assembly studies of intact RSV CA are also presented. The molecule is shown to form both tubes, constructed from a toroidal oligomer, and flat sheets.

Structure 2000, Vol 8 No 6

A native data set, which was used for the refinement of the structural model, was collected from a single frozen crystal at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) in Argonne, Illinois (station 14-BM-c) (Table 1). The crystal space group is P212121, with cell dimensions a = 40.5 Å, b = 64.5 Å, c = 108.9 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, related by an almost perfect twofold rotation. The Matthews coefficient, VM, is 2.16 Å3/Da, which corresponds to a solvent content of ~43%. Bragg diffraction from the crystals extends to approximately 2.0 Å resolution, but falls off in an anisotropic fashion.

NMR spectroscopy and data processing
All spectra were recorded at 25°C on a Varian UnityPlus 600 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a z-shielded gradient triple-resonance probe. NMR data were analyzed with the programs NMRPipe [40] and ANSIG [41]. 1H chemical shifts are reported relative to DSS. 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using standard frequency ratios. Steady-state heteronuclear 1H­15N NOEs were measured using the pulse sequences of Farrow et al. [42], with and without proton saturation. Approximate error estimates were derived from the intensity variation in background regions [42].

Crystallographic phase determination by MAD
To phase the X-ray diffraction data, a MAD experiment, based on the selenium K-edge, was carried out at the APS (station 14-BM-d). Data were collected at five wavelengths, four of which were close to the X-ray absorption edge (Table 1). The inverse beam method was used to accumulate the Friedel pairs at each wavelength. Data collected at each wavelength were put on the same relative scale using the program FHSCAL [33]. Estimates for |FA|, the structure factor amplitudes of the anomalously scattering selenium atoms, were derived using an algebraic procedure (RLK, unpublished observations). Direct methods coupled with phase annealing [34] were used to locate nine of ten selenium atoms. Phases were calculated and refined using the program MLPHARE [35]. This yielded a readily interpretable map, which was further improved using solvent flattening and histogram matching with the program DM [36].

Spectral assignments
Sequential backbone assignments were made using a combination of 15N-resolved [1H,1H]-NOESY, HNHA, HNHB77, and J-correlation experiments (CBCANH, CBCACONH). Assignments of sidechain nuclei were made using a combination of J-correlation experiments (H(CCO)NH, C(CO)NH) and NOE-based approaches. Complete 1H, 15N and 13C chemical shift assignment was achieved for residues 155­230 of the C-terminal domain. Stereospecific assignments have not been made. Chemical shift assignment within the unstructured C-terminal region (231­249) was complicated by chemical shift heterogeneity, resonance overlap, and limited NOE information. Partial assignments, including most of the backbone nuclei, have been made for this region.

Determination of conformational constraints Model building and refinement
The program Xfit from the XTALVIEW software package [37] was used for interactive model building. The model was refined with the program CNS [38], using torsion angle molecular dynamics procedures that incorporate a maximum-likelihood target function. Atomic displacements were modeled with an isotropic B value for each atom, with restraints on the B values of neighboring atoms. The contribution of the bulk solvent to the X-ray diffraction was modeled using a flat masking procedure [39]. No noncrystallographic symmetry restraints or constraints were applied during refinement. Five percent of the observed data was randomly selected for calculation of Rfree and excluded from all refinement procedures. Statistics associated with the final refined model are presented in Table 1. Distance restraints for the calculation of the 3D structure were derived from 13C- or 15N-resolved [1H,1H]-NOESY spectra (mixing time 150 ms). Distances (D) were estimated using the isolated spin pair approximation, Dij --6 = AIij, where A is a calibration factor determined using known distances within the  helices (H(i)  HN(i+3) ~3.4 Å). Upper (U) and lower (L) bounds for the structure calculation were then set to L = D -- 0.12D2, U = D + 0.12D2 [43]. Ambiguous and degenerate NOE crosspeaks were treated using `r--6 summation'. The 3J(HN,H) and 3J(N,H) coupling constants were derived from the HNHA and HNHB experiments, respectively [44]. Only the longer construct (CA155­249) was isotopically enriched with both 15N and 13C, and restraints used in the structure calculation were derived from spectra recorded on this protein.

Structure determination of the C-terminal domain of RSV CA Sample preparation
The two proteins encompassing the C-terminal domain of CA were expressed from cloned DNA segments as described for the N-terminal domain. One of the expressed proteins (CA155­237 ) comprises the last 83 amino acids of CA, plus an initiating methionine at the N terminus, and has a molecular weight of 9212 Da. A second protein (CA155­249) contains, in addition, the 12 amino acid spacer peptide and has a molecular weight of 9485 Da. Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled proteins were prepared by growing the cells in M9 minimal media, containing 15NH4Cl (1 g/l) and 12C6-Dglucose (2 g/l) or 15NH4Cl (1 g/l) and 13C6-D-glucose (2 g/l), respectively, supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 µg/ml). Protein expression was induced late in log phase growth (A600 ~0.7) by addition of IPTG. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction and lysed either by freeze-thaw cycling or using a French press. The crude cell lysate was suspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Protamine sulfate (final concentration 10 mg/ml) was added to precipitate nucleic acids. Following centrifugation, the RSV CA fragments were purified from the supernatant by size-exclusion chromatography. Superdex 200 and Superdex 75 columns (Pharmacia) were used in sequence. Purified proteins were concentrated to 10­20 mg/ml in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.9, containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM deuterated dithiothreitol. 10% (v/v) 2H20 was added to the samples before NMR data acquisition.

Calculation of the three-dimensional structure
Starting from an extended strand conformation, structures were calculated using torsion angle dynamics with the program CNS [38]. NOEderived distances were restrained by a flat-bottomed parabolic function and a simplified repulsive function describing the van der Waals interactions. Restraints on backbone  and  torsion angles were incorporated using an empirical relationship between these quantities and the 13C and 13C chemical shifts [45]. Direct refinement against vicinal scalar coupling constants was employed [46,47], with Karplus parameters relating coupling constants to torsion angles. Restraints based on 1H chemical shifts were included for the non-amide protons [48]. For the final calculation, 100 structures were generated using torsion angle molecular dynamics. On the basis of agreement with the experimental restraints and geometric ideality 19 these structures were accepted (Figure 3). A mean structure was calculated from this ensemble and regularized by restrained energy minimization. Statistics associated with the final structure calculation are shown in Table 2.

Structure validation
The final model has 88% of the residues in the core region of the Ramachandran plot and the remainder (excepting Ser210) in the additional allowed regions (defined by the program PROCHECK). Ser210 is found in a poorly restrained surface loop connecting helices 3 and 4 of the domain (Figure 3). The final model contains no highly improbable sidechain 1,2 choices [49]. It was also verified that most short interproton distances predicted by the model had corresponding NOE crosspeaks.

Arg170, which is an invariantly conserved residue within the MHR of the C-terminal domain, is poorly defined in the current model. Few NOE interactions were observed for the distal region of this sidechain, with exchangeable H protons. However, there are several indications that this residue actually adopts a fixed position within the structure. Firstly, the steady-state 1H­15N NOE is positive, with a magnitude (0.63) that is only slightly smaller than the backbone 1H­15N NOEs. In comparison, the 1H­15N NOEs for the other four arginine residues in the C-terminal domain (Arg185, Arg194, Arg206 and Arg225) are less than 0.08. Secondly, the sidechain H of Arg170 experiences a strong downfield shift, resonating at 9.86 ppm (cf. the random coil chemical shift of 8.06 ppm), consistent with the involvement of this residue in a strong hydrogen-bonding network. Finally, a weak NOE crosspeak can be identified between H of Arg170 and H of either residue 166 or 167. This localizes the sidechain to the same region it occupies in the crystallographic structures of HIV-1 and EIAV CA [6,8,9].

Self-association of RSV CA Behavior of the CA in dilute solution
Bacterial overexpression and purification of intact RSV CA has been described previously [18]. The behavior of the protein in dilute solution was studied by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia). The protein was suspended in 25 mM EPPS/NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl. The redox potential of the solution was controlled by including reduced and oxidized glutathione. Column runs were performed under both reducing (5.0 mM oxidized glutathione, 0.5 mM reduced glutathione) and oxidizing (0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 5.0 mM reduced glutathione) conditions, with protein loading concentrations between 1 and 20 mg/ml.

Assembly of CA into higher order structures
Self-assembly of CA was studied using both vapor-diffusion and equilibrium dialysis techniques. In general, sitting-drop vapor-diffusion methods gave the most reproducible results. CA (2­10 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl) was equilibrated against NaCl solutions buffered at varying pH. To monitor assembly, the samples were applied to glow-discharged carbon/formvar-coated electron microscopy grids. Excess liquid was removed by blotting. The samples were stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate, air-dried, and examined in the electron microscope. Assembly into regular structures occurred at mildly acidic pH, in the presence of moderate (0.6­1.1 M) NaCl concentrations. Typically, the NaCl solutions were buffered with 0.20 M citric acid/KOH pH 4.9, 0.20 M acetic acid/KOH pH 4.9, or 0.20 M malic acid/KOH pH 5.5. The temperature at which the experiments were performed was not critical and ranged between 4 and 37°C.

Electron microscopy and image processing
Images of the specimens were recorded using a Phillips EM420 electron microscope equipped with a lanthanum boride filament, operated at 80­100 kV. Micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO-163 photographic film, at a nominal magnification of 36000x, using a low-dose unit to reduce electron exposure. The micrographs were digitized on a Zeiss-SCAI scanner, with a step size of 7 or 14 µm. The MRC image processing package was used for image analysis. Defocus values were determined from the spacing of the Thon rings in the computed Fourier transform of each image. For analysis of the planar periodic arrays, maxima in the Fourier transform were manually indexed, and the lattice refined by least-squares methods. Fourier coefficients were then derived directly from the computed transform, by determining the amplitude and phase at the positions predicted by the crystallographic reciprocal lattice.
