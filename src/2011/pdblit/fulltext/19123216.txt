Abstract: Total synthesis of naturally occurring casuarine (1) and the first total synthesis of casuarine 6-O-a-glucoside (2) were achieved through complete stereoselective nitrone cycloaddition, Tamao­Fleming oxidation and selective a-glucosylation as key steps. Biological assays of the two compounds proved their strong and selective inhibitory properties towards glucoamylase NtMGAM and trehalase Keywords: enzyme structures · maltase glucoamylase · natural products · total synthesis · trehalase Tre37A, respectively, which place them among the most powerful inhibitors of these enzymes. The structural determination of the complexes of NtMGAM with 1 and of Tre37A with 2 revealed interesting similarities in the catalytic sites of these two enzymes which belong to different families and clans.

Introduction
Casuarine, (1R,2R,3R,6S,7S,7aR)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-1,2,6,7tetrahydroxypyrrolizidine (1), and its 6-O-a-glucoside, casuarine 6-O-a-glucopyranoside (2) (see below), have been iso-

(Myrtaceae),[1] two plants well known for their therapeutic action against diarrhoea, dysentery and colic,[2] breast cancer,[1] diabetes and bacterial infections.[2, 3] Compounds 1 and 2 are strong inhibitors of the fungal glucoamylase from

Aspergillus niger, with very similar IC50 values (IC50 = 0.7 mm for 1, IC50 = 1.1 mm for 2).[4] No inhibition data against human a-glucosidases or glucoamylases are available to date. Human maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM, EC 3.2.1.20) falls into family GH31 of the Carbohydrate Active enZyme (CAZy) classification.[5] It is one of the two enzymes (together with sucrase-isomaltase SI, EC 3.2.1.48 and 3.2.1.10) responsible for catalyzing the last step in starch digestion by hydrolyzing mixtures of dextrins at the non-reducing end into glucose with net retention of anomeric configuration.[6] Inhibitors of enzymes involved in the starch-digestion pathway are used to delay glucose production and thus aid in the treatment of Type II diabetes.[7] This therapeutic poten-

tial would be encouraged by an in-depth study of their mode of action.[8] Some of us recently reported[9] the first crystal structure of the human N-terminal subunit of MGAM (NtMGAM) in its apo form and in complex with acarbose (3) (see below), a tetrasaccharide analogue currently on the market as an antidiabetic drug (Glucobay, Precose). Trehalases, another class of glycoside hydrolase of current interest, hydrolyze one of the two glycosidic bonds in trehalose (a-d-glucopyranosyl-a-d-glucopyranoside) with inversion at the anomeric center.[10] Trehalases are vital for insect flight by providing glucose from trehalose hydrolysis, and thus their inhibition is an interesting target for novel insecticides.[7] Casuarine (1) and its glucoside 2 are known to inhibit porcine kidney trehalase (IC50 = 12 and 0.34 mm, respectively).[4] Some of us recently presented the first three-dimensional structure of a periplasmic trehalase from Escherichia coli (Tre37A), which belongs to family GH37 of the CAZy classification, in complex with some potent inhibitors, 1-thiatrehazolin (4) and validoxylamine A (5).[11] In order to evaluate and compare the inhibitory activity of 1 and 2 towards the human NtMGAM and E. coli Tre37A we undertook the total syntheses of both compounds.

iminosugars isolated from natural sources, thus indicating that their occurrence in Nature is not uncommon.[14] In contrast, few syntheses of glycosyl iminosugars are reported in the literature,[15, 16] and they all reflect some difficulties in targeting the final compounds with good yields and selectivities, particularly in the glucosylation step. Interestingly, their inhibitory properties differ substantially from those of the parent iminosugar, with the linked carbohydrate moiety usually generating higher selectivity. This can be due, in principle, to a different arrangement within the catalytic site or, most likely, to additional stabilizing (or destabilizing) interactions with other subsites. In this paper we report a straightforward and highly selective approach to the synthesis of casuarine (1) and the first total synthesis of casuarine-6-O-a-glucoside (2), their inhibitory activity towards NtMGAM and Tre37A, and the threedimensional structure of NtMGAM in complex with 1 and Tre37A in complex with 2, supported by a molecular modeling study. These data provide a rationale for understanding the complementary inhibitory properties of 1 and 2 against human NtMGAM and E. coli Tre37A. These studies also show that although MGAM and Tre37A belong to different families and clans,[5] have different sizes, and operate by different mechanisms (MGAM proceeds with retention, and Tre37A with inversion of configuration at the anomeric center), many similarities are found within their active sites. Importantly, we found that casuarine (1) is able to inhibit NtMGAM more strongly than the pseudo tetrasaccharide acarbose (3), holding promise for the development of novel antidiabetic drugs, and that its 6-O-a-glucoside 2 inhibits Tre37A at levels comparable with its most powerful known inhibitors.

Results and Discussion
Our approach to the synthesis of casuarine (1) started with nitrone 6, available in multigram scale from 2,3,5-tri-O-benzylarabinofuranose.[17] Nitrone 6 has the correct relative and absolute stereochemistry at C1, C2 and C3 of the target molecule. The first key step for the synthesis of the casuarine skeleton was the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrone 6 with (Z)-alkene 7. Although no close example was reported, we were confident that (Z)-disubstituted alkene 7 could provide the correct regioselectivity in the cycloaddition step on the basis of related nitrone cycloadditions with vinyl silanes.[18] Indeed, the desired adduct 8 was obtained with high regio- and stereoselectivity in 79 % yield (Scheme 1). The regiochemistry and relative stereochemistry of 8 were firmly established on the basis of COSY and NOESY experiments. The complete stereoselectivity of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, which allowed the selective installation of the three new stereocenters (corresponding to C6, C7 and C7a in the target molecule) in one step with the required configuration, may be ascribed to the peculiar all-trans disposition of the benzyloxy groups in nitrone 6, which hampered any endo or syn approaches.[17, 19]

Isolation and purification of 1 and 2 from natural sources are very difficult and expensive, and afford only minor amounts (indeed, 2 has never been obtained in a chemically pure form). Furthermore, very few total syntheses of casuarine (1) have been reported to date,[12, 13] and no total synthesis of 2 has been previously described. The highly complex and challenging structure of casuarine, as it is the most highly hydroxylated pyrrolizidine alkaloid and possesses six contiguous carbon stereocenters, is presumably responsible for the limited number of synthetic approaches described. An additional problematic issue in the synthesis of casuarine 6-O-a-glucoside lies in the selectivity of glucosylation of the hydroxy group at C6. Carefully planned extraction procedures have recently uncovered more examples of glycosyl

Reductive cleavage of the NÀO bond[17, 20, 21] with Zn in acetic acid followed by spontaneous N-cyclization afforded lactam 9 in 93 % yield. Then, the Tamao­Fleming reaction[22] allowed oxidation of the CÀSi bond with retention of configuration and 76 % yield of diol 10. Oxidation of the C-Si bond to C-OH with retention of configuration was confirmed by NOESY experiments performed on the diacetyl derivative of 10. Finally, reduction of 10 with LiAlH4 in refluxing THF (78 % yield), followed by catalytic hydrogenation of pyrrolizidine 11, provided quantitatively casuarine (1) as a white solid (m.p. 180­182 8C). The spectroscopic data and physicochemical properties of the synthesized compound were identical to those of natural casuarine.[1a] Synthetic 1 showed a specific optical rotation ([a]20 = + 14.4 (c D = 0.52, H2O)) in good agreement with those reported for the natural and for the previously synthesized compound ([a]24 = + 16.9 (c = 0.80, H2O);[1a] [a]27 = + 10.8 (c = 1.02, D D H2O)[12a]). In conclusion, our total synthesis furnished casuarine in five steps and 44 % overall yield from nitrone 6, which compares well with the previously reported syntheses. For the synthesis of casuarine 6-O-a-glucoside (2), we needed to carry out the Tamao­Fleming oxidation prior to glycosylation as the glycosidic bond did not tolerate the harsh reaction conditions of Tamao­Fleming oxidation. Acetylation of lactam 9 and subsequent Tamao­Fleming oxidation afforded 12 with 82 % yield (Scheme 2). Then, a protection­deprotection sequence (75 % yield over 2 steps) was required to give the intermediate 13, which bears the free hydroxy group at C6 suitable to be linked to the glucose moiety. The glucosylation reaction of 13 was carried out with the trichloroacetimidate 14 and catalytic TMSOTf in diethyl ether and afforded selectively the a-anomer 15 in 72 % yield. Only traces of the b-anomer, which could not be isolated, were detected in the crude reaction mixture. Reduction of C=O double bond of 15 was not a trivial task. LiAlH4, Red-Al, BH3·SMe2 or LiBH4 in refluxing THF afforded complex mixtures of products, while at room temper-

ature the starting material was converted only marginally. Eventually, treatment of 15 with a high excess of LiBH4 in combination with BH3·THF at room temperature for three days[23] afforded glucoside 16 in 68 % yield. Catalytic hydrogenation finally provided casuarine 6-O-a-glucoside (2) in 77 % yield as a white foam. The synthesis of casuarine 6-O-a-glucoside (2) renders it available in a chemically pure form. Indeed, the sample isolated from a natural source was evaluated to be only around 60 % pure.[1b] Only 1H NMR and 13C NMR data have been reported for the isolated natural compound and they are in good agreement with those of the compound synthesized by us, thus confirming the assignment proposed by the authors.[1b] Inhibition studies of 1 and 2 towards NtMGAM and Tre37A show complementary behaviour with the two enzymes (Table 1).

NtMGAM inhibition studies revealed that 1, with a Ki of 0.45 mm, displayed over 600-fold greater inhibition against NtMGAM compared to 2, which inhibited with a Ki of 280 mm. These results are similar to the inhibition profile of rat intestinal maltase where 1 and 2 inhibit with IC50 values of 0.7 and 260 mm, respectively, but are in contrast to the inhibition profile of fungal glucoamylases where 1 and 2 display similar and potent inhibitory activities.[4] The similarity in inhibition profiles between NtMGAM and the rat intestinal maltase agrees with previous kinetic

studies,[9, 24] which propose that the N-terminal MGAM domain of human maltase-glucoamylase displays maltase activity whereas its C-terminal catalytic domain displays glucoamylase activity. The crystal structure of NtMGAM in complex with 1 was solved to 2.1  (see Experimental Section for details and data processing and refinement statistics). The electron density clearly revealed one molecule of 1, Figure 1a, bound in

the À1 subsite and one glycerol molecule (originating from the cryoprotection solution) bound in the + 1 subsite. The two pyrrolidine rings, named "A" and "B" (shown above), both adopt an envelope configuration; ring A is in a 2E conformation, and ring B in an E6 conformation. With its heavily hydroxylated rings, 1 binds tightly to the NtMGAM active site primarily through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chains lining the À1 subsite (Figure 2a). These include hydrogen bonds between D327 and the hydroxyl groups at C8 and C2, H600 with the C1-OH and C2-OH, D443 with the C7-OH and the pyrrolidine nitrogen, R526 with the C7-OH and D542 with the C6-OH. The weaker inhibition of 2 compared with 1 leads us to believe that the addition of glucoside group of 2 makes unfavourable interactions with the + 1 subsite, or weakly competes with the casuarine group to occupy the À1 subsite, both of which may decrease the inhibition properties of the casuarine group. Kinetic data were measured on Tre37A using an assay where glucose was detected by glucose oxidase/peroxidase linking enzymes following trehalose hydrolysis (see Experimental Section for details). Ki values for 1 and 2 were determined at 37 8C and pH 5.5, and included a 20-minute pre-incubation of the inhibitor with the enzyme to prevent any complications in the data analysis from slow onset inhibition. Compound 2 was shown to be around a thousand fold

more potent than 1 (Table 1), indicating that the glucose moiety in the + 1 subsite (see below) contributes considerACHTUNGREably to binding. This fits with the fact that Tre37A hydrolyses disaccharide substrates and therefore presumably has evolved to optimise interactions in both the À1 and + 1 subsites.[11] X-ray data for Tre37A in complex with 2 were collected to 1.9  (see Experimental Section for details and data processing and refinement statistics). There was clear electron density in each of the four molecules of the asymmetric unit corresponding to a molecule of 2, Figure 1b. The casuarine moiety of 2 is bound in the À1 subsite of Tre37A (Figure 2b). The two pyrrolidine rings are both found in an envelope conformation; ring A is in a 2E conformation, and ring B in a 5E conformation. The glucose moiety of 2, in the + 1 subsite, is bound in a relaxed 4C1 conformation. The majority of the interactions between the glucose and the active site residues of Tre37A are as described previously;[11] the exception to this is the hydroxyl group at the C6 position, which hydrogen bonds with a sulfate group from the crystallization conditions, and appears to cause a large movement of E511 away from the active site. The hydroxyl group at C8 of the casuarine moiety hydrogen bonds with D160 and a water molecule, the C2-OH interacts with D160 and the oxygen of Q207 and the C1-OH with W159 and the back-

6-O-a-glucoside (2) and Tre37A in complex with casuarine (1) using Glide[26] docking simulations. Docking of 2 in NtMGAM places the casuarine moiety in the À1 subsite, and consequently the glucose moiety in the + 1 subsite (Figure 4c). With respect to the crystallographic structure (Figure 4a), the casuarine (aglyconic) portion of 2 is not perfectly overlapped with 1, probably due to the presence of the 1,1-linkage instead of 1,4 present in physiological substrates. Nevertheless, all of the hydrogen bonds we found in the casuarine complex are formed by the casuarine portion of 2 in the modelling, with the exception of the hydrogen bond between C6-OH of casuarine and D542, because of the presence of the glucosidic bond in that position. The glucose moiety which lies in the + 1 subsite is able to form a few hydrogen bonds with solvent exposed residues but is also in close contact to bulky residues that surround the À1 subsite entrance and which may form a sort of "linkage selector" in order to assure 1,4-linkage selectivity for the enzyme. All together, these observations give a rationale to the observed difference in inhibitory activity between 1 and 2; the weaker inhibition of NtMGAM by 2 most likely reflects the speciACHTUNGREficity of the enzyme which has evolved to hydrolyse the a-1,4 linkages in starch-derived dextrins whereas 2 is a trehalose (a,a-1,1) mimic. Interestingly, a comparison with the crystal structure of NtMGAM in complex with acarbose previously reported,[9] shows that the acarbose (3) is stabilized by an electrostatic interaction between its positively charged nitrogen and D542, but lacks the two hydrogen bonds with D443 (Figure 4b). Therefore, casuarine (1) is the only one of the three inhibitors to interact with both of the key residues D443 and D542, which may be partly responsible for the two orders of magnitude increase in inhibition with respect to acarbose (3) or 2. Tre37A has a buried cavity, specific both for the a,a-1,1 substrate and for a glucoside in the + 1 leaving group subsite. The shape and dimension of 2 are thus optimal for maximizing transition state mimicking interactions in the À1 subsite and leaving group glycoside interactions in + 1. These are achieved through hydrogen bonds involving all of its acceptor and donor groups (Figure 5a). A similar network of interactions were observed for previously solved complexes with 1-thiatrehazolin (4) and validoxylamine A (5),[11] which have a similar enzyme affinity (Figure 5b and c, respectively). As the binding of 1 leaves one of the two subsites of Tre37A empty (Figure 5d and e), fewer hydrogen bonds can be formed with the protein. The formation of fewer interactions gives a rationalization for the lower affinity of the "monosaccharide-like" inhibitor compound as opposed to the "diACHTUNGREsaccharide-like" equivalent.

bone carbonyl of G310. The nitrogen atom in the pyrrolizidine ring interacts with the same water molecule as the C8OH. In ring B, the hydroxyl group at C7 interacts with W447 and a different water molecule (not shown). Despite having different protein sequences and architectural folds, structural comparison of the two enzymes reveals an intriguing similarity of their binding sites, as shown in Figure 3, which was obtained by overlapping the pyrrolizidine nuclei in the two enzyme­inhibitor complexes. Although not perfectly superimposable, almost every residue lining the À1 subsite of NtMGAM corresponds to a similar and analogously oriented residue in the Tre37A active site. The most conserved residues are those directly involved in ligand hydrogen bonding (D327, H600 and D542 in NtMGAM, which corresponds to D160, W159 and D312 in Tre37A, respectively). An exception to this is the backbone carbonyl of G310 in Tre37A, which corresponds to a water molecule in NtMGAM. Most of the hydrophobic residues lining the À1 subsite are also conserved and occupy approximately the same positions (Y299, W406, W441, W539 and H600 in NtMGAM which correspond to Y157, F153, W520, W447 and W159 in Tre37A, respectively). The two binding sites differ in the position of the catalytic side chains (D443, the nucleophile in the retaining NtMGAM and E496, the base in the inverting Tre37A), by more than 3 , reflecting the different mechanisms utilised by the enzymes. Strikingly, as mentioned above, the respective catalytic acids, D542 in MGAM and D312 in Tre37A, superimpose closely. An important difference between the two binding sites is the presence of a phenylalanine (F575) in NtMGAM in close proximity to the catalytic acid/base D542, while the corresponding amino acid in Tre37A is an alanine (A307). In accorACHTUNGREdance with their varying functions, the + 1 binding sites of NtMGAM and Tre37A have major differences, reflecting the specificity for a-1,4 and a,a-1,1 linkages, respectively. In addition, this site in NtMGAM is exposed to the solvent, while in Tre37A it is a buried cavity.

lowed the total synthesis of casuarine 6-O-a-glucoside (2) to be accomplished from nitrone 6 in nine steps and 17 % overall yield, thus opening the way for the generation of a number of differently glycosylated pyrrolizidine iminodisaccharides. This study demonstrates that among glycoside hydrolase enzymes that belong to different families and clans, and which differ in mechanism of action, there is a degree of conservation of the analogous active site residues reflecting the convergent evolution of optimised non-covalent interactions. The binding of inhibitors 1 and 2 were investigated with NtMGAM and Tre37A by kinetic and structural methods, which provide information on the relevant interactions in the active site and could form the basis for the synthesis of analogues. This study shows that casuarine can be envisaged as a lead compound for the construction of novel diACHTUNGREsaccharide and polysaccharide type glycoside hydrolase inhibitors, the syntheses of which are currently ongoing in our laboratories.

Kinetic methods: Inhibition assays of NtMGAM were carried out in 96well microtitre plates containing 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, inhibitor and p-nitrophenol d-glucopyranoside (pNP-glucose, Sigma) as substrate (2.5­30 mm). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 50 minutes at 37 8C before quenching with 0.5 m sodium carbonate and measuring the release of the p-nitrophenolate ion at 405 nm. Inhibition of Tre37A was determined using a stopped assay, where glucose was detected using glucose oxidase/peroxidase linking enzymes (Megazyme, Bray, Eire) in the same way as described previously.[11] Measurements were made at trehalose concentrations between 0.05 and 6 mm and Tre37A was present at a final concentration of 0.7 nm. The Ki values of 1 and 2 against NtMGAM and Tre37A were calculated by determining the reaction rates of the enzymes in the absence and presence of inhibitor. Concentrations of 0.2­0.6 mm 1 or 0.4­1.2 mm 2 were used to inhibit NtMGAM and concentrations of 10­40 mm 1 or 10­ 20 nm 2 were used to inhibit Tre37A. Rates were determined and the data fitted to the Michaelis­Menten equation in GRAFIT (Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK) to obtain a KM (in absence of inhibitor) or apparent KM (KMapp) (in presence of inhibitor). Ki values were determined using the equation KMapp = KM (1 + [I]/Ki). Structural methods: The crystallization of NtMGAM was previously reported by Sim et al.[9] The complex of NtMGAM with 1 was obtained by soaking NtMGAM crystals for % 12 h in mother liquor supplemented with 200 mm 1. X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector at beamline F1 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and were processed with HKL2000.[28] Since the crystal of NtMGAM in complex with 1 was isomorphous to the crystal of NtMGAM in complex with acarbose,[9] this structure was used as

an initial model to calculate Fo-Fc maps. These difference maps clearly revealed the position of casuarine in the NtMGAM active site. Inhibitor topologies and restraints were generated using the PRODRG server (http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/) and the model was subsequently modified and refined using COOT[29] and REFMAC.[30] Data processing and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2.

Gene expression and purification of Tre37A was carried out as described previously.[11] Protein, at a concentration of 10­12 mg/ mL, was co-crystallized with 5 mm 2 from 1.7 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m citric acid buffer, pH 3.5. Crystals were cryoprotected in the mother liquor supplemented with 25 % ethylene glycol and flash frozen. Data were collected on beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), and were processed with the HKL2000 suite.[28] As the cell dimensions differed from previous complexes of Tre37A, structure solution required molecular replacement in PHASER[31] using a monomer of 2 JF4 as the search model. The model was refined with manual building in COOT[29] interspersed with refinement of geometric restraints in REFMAC.[30] Data processing and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. Computational methods: All calculations were performed on 2  AMD Opteron285 Dual Core processors running Linux RedHat OS. The structures of the complexes between NtMGAM and casuarine (1) and Tre37A and casuarine 6-O-a-glucoside (2) were superimposed by the pyrrolizidine nuclei. After the removal of all non-protein molecules, the crystallographic structures were prepared according to the Glide protein preparation procedure[26] used to assign missing hydrogens and to reduce structural problems. Docking calculations were performed with the Glide program using default input parameters (no scaling factor for the vdW radii of non polar protein atoms, 0.8 scaling factor for non polar ligand atoms) and the SP scoring function was used to evaluate the resulting poses. The best docked conformations were chosen using the GlideScore, a modified and extended version of the empirically based ChemScore function.[32]
