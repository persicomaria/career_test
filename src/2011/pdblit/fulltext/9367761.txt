ABSTRACT Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) cleaves phosphoinositides into two parts, lipid-soluble diacylglycerol and the water-soluble phosphorylated inositol. Two crystal forms of Bacillus cereus PI-PLC have been obtained by the vapor diffusion technique. Hexagonal crystals were grown from solutions containing polyethylene glycol (PEG; 4,000 to 8,000 D). The space group of these hexagonal crystals is P6122 (or the enantiomorphic space group P6522), with cell constants a = b = 133 A, and c = 231 A. The crystals diffract to 2.8 A. The second crystalline form was grown from a two-phase PEG (600 D)-sodium citrate solution. The phase diagram and PI-PLC distribution between phases has been determined. The enzyme crystallizes from the PEG-rich phase. The crystals are orthorhombic with space group P212121 (a = 45 A, b = 46 A, c = 160 A), and contain one PI-PLC monomer per asymmetric unit. The orthorhombic crystals diffract to 2.5 A. Both the hexagonal and orthorhombic forms are suitable for crystallographic studies.

INTRODUCTION

Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (EC 3.1.4.10) cleaves phosphoinositides into two parts: the lipid-soluble diacylglycerol, and the phosphorylated water-soluble inositol headgroup. An increasing number of PI-PLCs are being found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. They are secreted by a variety of bacteria, including Bacillus cereus ( 1, 2) and the closely related Bacillus thuringiensis (3, 4), the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (5) and Listeria monocytogenes (6-8), and the marine bacterium Cytophaga sp. (NCMB 1314, 9). PI-PLC is one of three classes of enzymes that have phospholipase C activity. Another type is phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C (PC-PLC, sometimes called lecithinase). PC-PLC is less specific, hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. The crystal structure of a phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase from B. cereus has been reported ( 10). A third enzyme with a phospholipase C-like activity is sphingomyelinase. These latter two enzymes do not hydrolyze PI. There appears to be little or no sequence homology between these three types of phospholipases C. The bacterial PI-PLCs also cleave glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a derivative of PI, and thus release GPI-anchored proteins from membrane surfaces ( 11). The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei has a GPIPLC thought to play a role in the ability of trypanosomes to shed the variable surface glycoprotein (12-15). The malaria-causing Plasmodiumfalciparum evidently has a PI-PLC activity ( 16, 17), as has the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum ( 18). In higher eukaryotes, PI-PLCs are involved in signal transduction. Drosophila PI-PLCs have been reported ( 19-21 ), and an avian PI-PLC from turkey erythrocytes has been sequenced (22, 23). Mammalian PI-PLCs have

been found in nearly all tissues examined (for reviews see 24-26). In some mammalian cells in culture, PTPLC activity is also present on the exterior surface (27, 28). In addition, PI-PLCs are being reported in higher

plants (29, 30).
The purpose of this paper is to report the successful crystallization of a member of the PI-PLC family of enzymes. We selected the B. cereus PI-PLC because it is a relatively small enzyme (35 kD) compared to the PIPLCs of higher eukaryotes (85-155 kD). Also, the B. cereus PI-PLC has been overexpressed in E. coli so that sufficient quantities are available for x-ray crystallography studies (31 ).
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemicals and biochemicals
Polyethylene glycol ofaverage molecular weight 600 (PEG 600; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), sodium citrate dihydrate ("Baker Analyzed" grade; J. T. Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ), HEPES (free acid; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and myo-inositol (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI; and Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) were used without further purification. Precipitant solutions for growing orthorhombic crystals, as well as total systems used to determine the phase diagram and PI-PLC partitioning, were prepared from the following stock solutions: 1 M and 1.6 M sodium citrate dihydrate, pH to 7.3 with HCI; I M HEPES, pH to 7.9 with NaOH; 0.5 M myo-inositol. These solutions were sterilized using cellulose acetate membrane filters (0.2 ,m pore size; Nalgene; Nalge Company, Rochester, NY; or Uniflow-25; Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH) and stored in sterile polypropylene tubes (50 ml capacity) at room temperature. Recombinant B. cereus PI-PLC was isolated from E. coli strain MM294 harboring the overexpressing plasmid pIC (31 ). The protein was stored in 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.5, at -20°C. All aqueous solutions were prepared using sterile filtered deionized water. All our preparations contain no stabilizing or antimicrobial agents.

Crystallization
The B. cereus PI-PLC used for crystallization was transferred from 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.5, to water by repeated ultrafiltration (Centricon10; Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The PI-PLC concentration in water was usually 6-8 mg/ml. All crystallization experiments were carried

Hanging drops were prepared by mixing 2-10 Al ofprotein with an equal volume of precipitant solution on glass cover slips (No. 2, round, 22 mm; VWR Scientific, Inc., Media, PA) which had been treated with siliconizing solution (AquaSil; Pierce, Rockford, IL/or Prosil-28; PCR Inc., Gainesville, FL). These cover slips were inverted and sealed over 1 ml of hypertonic reservoir solution (either precipitant or sodium chloride solution) in 24-well Linbro plates (Cat. No. 76-033-05; Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA).

The relative NMR peak areas of the component for which the concentration is to be calculated are given by AL (lower phase) and AU (upper phase).

Hexagonal crystals. Initially, in a screen of conditions using PEG as precipitating agent, hexagonal microcrystals formed in the presence of 5% (wt/vol) PEG 8000,50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. Further crystallization trials were conducted using the sparse matrix sampling approach of Jancarik and Kim (33). Forty six of the fifty trial conditions of these authors were carried out, with one modification: the respective solutions were diluted 1: 1 with water. Four sets of conditions yielded hexagonal crystals: (a) 0.1 M magnesium chloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 15% PEG 8000; (b) 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, 50 mM cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 15% PEG 8000; (c) 0.1 M sodium acetate, 50 mM TrisHCI, pH 8.5, and 15% PEG 4000; and (d) 0.1 M ammonium sulfate, and 15% PEG 8000, pH 6.3 (unadjusted). These trials yielded no additional crystal morphologies. We experienced some difficulty in reproducing these crystals. However, by varying the growing conditions, crystals were almost always obtainable. The largest crystals grew in the presence of 15% PEG 4000, 0.15 M sodium acetate, and 0.1 M TrisHCI, pH 8.5.

Protein distribution between the PEGrich and sodium citrate-rich phases
In a typical experiment, the buffer of the purified protein at 20.6 mg/ ml was exchanged for 93 mM HEPES, pH 7.9 by repeated ultrafiltration (Centricon- 10) and the protein concentration was adjusted to 16.3 mg/ml. The concentration of PI-PLC was determined spectrophotometrically as follows. The amino acid sequence of the mature PI-PLC protein from B. cereus, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of its coding region (35), was used to calculate the molar extinction coefficient by the method of Gill and von Hippel (36). The calculated value is E2-n = 1.83. To provide a linear relation of PI-PLC concentration and absorbance at 280 nm, protein dilutions giving an A280 < 0.6 were used. Small volumes ( 160 ,ul) of total systems containing /4 or l/8 volume of 16.3 mg/ml PI-PLC were prepared in 0.65 ml microcentrifuge tubes. After brief vortexing to mix the components, complete phase separation was obtained after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 5 min. Volumes were determined by comparison to standard volumes in identical tubes. All procedures were performed at room temperature. The phases were removed and diluted 1:40 (upper phase) or 1:20 (lower phase) in water for measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The blanks for the spectrophotometer measurements were 1:40 or 1:20 dilutions of upper and lower phase from total systems without PI-PLC but otherwise identical.

PI-PLC were grown at 4°C in the presence of 0.2 M sodium citrate, pH 5.6 and 45% PEG 600. This set of conditions gave small twinned crystals overnight. By changing the precipitant solution to 0.3 M sodium citrate, 28% PEG 600, 50 mM myo-inositol and 10 to 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, we have produced the larger single rods with a rectangular cross-section discussed below. Crystallization drops typically consisted of 10 ,ul protein solution mixed with 10 ,ul precipitant solution suspended over a reservoir of precipitant solution. Most drops gave
hundreds of small crystals or no crystals at all. In order to find the optimal hypertonicity of the reservoir solution, drops were placed over a series of increasing sodium chloride concentrations (2.0-3.0 M sodium chloride in 50 mM increments). Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction data collection grew over 2.55 M sodium chloride at 4°C.

The phase diagram was determined by the general approach described by Albertsson for aqueous two phase systems (34). In 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes (graduated at 0.1 ml increments), total systems containing PEG 600, sodium citrate, myo-inositol and HEPES at concentrations given in Table 1 were prepared by dilution of the appropriate stock solutions. To accelerate the separation of the two aqueous phases, the preparations were centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5 min. The total volume (V0), as well as the volumes of upper (Vu) and lower phases (VL) were read directly from the graduated centrifuge tubes (see Table 1). All procedures were performed at room temperature. The concentrations of PEG 600, sodium citrate and myo-inositol were determined by

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Hexagonal crystals of B. cereus PI-PLC
Small hexagonal crystals were obtained using PEG 8000 as the precipitant (Fig. 1). The largest crystals we observed were on the order of 0.12mm x 0.12mm x 0.35 mm. The crystals were mounted with their long axes perpendicular to the x-ray beam. A series of still photographs at various rotations about this axis show equivalent zones at 600 intervals. These zones are interspersed with another set of zones, 300 away. Both zones display mm symmetry, as seen on screened precession photographs. Only hexagonal space groups have such equivalent zones, axially spaced at 600, with mm symmetry. The major zone (hOl) was identified based on its more closely spaced layer lines, relative to the diagonal zone. The two zones have a common row of reflections, related to the axis of rotation between them, which only shows

NMR measurements were on 20 yd of sample combined with 0.4 ml of D20. The concentrations of PEG 600, sodium citrate and myo-inositol in each phase were calculated from the peak area relative to the sodium benzoate standard, the concentration of the component in the total system, and the measured volumes of the phases. For example, the concentration of a component in the lower phase is given by:

The composition of a total system states the concentration of all components in this preparation regardless of their distribution between the phases. All systems were prepared and analyzed at room temperature (23°C). * The total systems also contained HEPES (50 mM) and myo-inositol (71 mM in a, 67 mM in b, 63 mM in c, and 56 mM in d). Additional data were recorded at constant myo-inositol (50 mM) concentration. The phase diagram was the same within experimental error. § The concentrations of PEG 600 and Na citrate in upper and lower phases were determined using NMR as described under Materials and Methods.
every sixth reflection, compared to neighboring rows. This row suggests a 6,-screw operator along the c axis. In the hkO photograph of the diffraction pattern, twelve symmetry mates are present for each reflection. This can only occur in our hexagonal space group if there are 2-fold axes of symmetry perpendicular to the 6-fold screw axis. We therefore assign the space group to be P6,22 (or the enantiomorphic space group, P6522). This space group has twelve asymmetric units per unit cell. We determined cell constants from an hOl precession photograph. The distance between reflections on the hOO layer line indicates the cell parameters a = b = 133 A. From the distance between = 6n reflections on the 001 layer, c is calculated to be 231 A. The unit cell volume (V) is V = a2c sin 600 = 3.54 x 106 A3 or 295 x 103 A3 per asymmetric unit. To determine the most likely num-

ber of PI-PLC monomers in each asymmetric unit we assumed a crystal packing parameter of2.15 A3/Dalton. This is the most commonly observed value in a survey of solved protein structures reported by Matthews (38). The resulting number of 35 kD proteins that can be accommodated in the asymmetric unit is 3.9. Thus, there are probably 4 PI-PLC monomers in each asymmetric unit of the hexagonal unit cell (2-5 are possibilities).

Phase diagram for the PEG 600sodium citrate system and partitioning of PI-PLC in the two phases
experience, orthorhombic PI-PLC crystals can be in PEG 600 and sodium citrate containing precipitant solution after phase separation occurs in the hanging drop, following partial dehydration of the hanging drop (usually >50%). Polyethylene glycols with other polymers, or certain combinations of water-soluble polymers and salt, cause separation into two aqueous phases, depending on the concentration of solutes. Although polyethylene glycols are frequently employed as precipitating reagents in protein crystallization studies (32, 39), these phase separations are rarely explored in detail. However, in the field of industrial-scale bioseparations, there is an extensive literature on aqueous two-phase systems based on two water soluble polymers, for example PEG and dextran (34, 40). These polymers, or certain combinations of water soluble polymers and salts, cause a separation into two aqueous phases. Proteins and other biological macromolecules added to these systems partition unequally between the two phases, and this partition provides the basis for protein isolation. In one study particularly relevant to the present work, Vernau and Kula (41 ) examined a series of aqueous two-phase systems resulting from mixtures of PEG 400 to 20,000 and sodium citrate. Their goal was to develop a system for extracting enzymes from cell homogenates based on biodegradable citrates. During the course of their work, Vernau and Kula established that PEG and sodium ciIn our grown

trate will form a two-phase system in the absence of any added protein, and that a range of proteins (e.g., leucine

inositol, detected in lower phase only, and HEPES, which was found evenly distributed between the phases, were omitted from Fig. 2, for clarity. The phase diagram explains several observations regarding the growth conditions of the orthorhombic crystals. Initially, the hanging drop consists of one homogeneous phase, corresponding to points well below the binodial of Fig. 2 (e.g., 14% PEG 600 and 0.15 M sodium citrate). As vapor diffusion progresses, the concentrations of PEG 600 and sodium citrate increase, until a phase separation occurs. PI-PLC crystal growth appears to be supported only in the upper but not in the lower phase. The phase separation is a property of the PEG 600-sodium citrate system, and is not caused by the PI-PLC. To examine the partitioning of B. cereus PI-PLC between the two aqueous phases, total systems were prepared analogous to those in the phase diagram (Fig. 2) except that PI-PLC was added. The results are tabulated
in Table 2. We found a distinct preference of PI-PLC for the PEG-rich phase, with partition coefficients (K = Cu C0) that correlate with the concentration of PEG 600 in the upper phase (K values for systems 1-4 are K1 = 2.4, K2 = 5.9, K3 = 16.5, K3b = 17.5, K4 = 35.0, respectively). Thus, one effect ofthe phase separation is to concentrate the protein in the upper phase. These results are in agreement with the protein separation studies of Vernau and Kula (41 ). At first glance, they might appear to be at variance with a report by Alber et al., (42) that yeast triose phosphate isomerase is concentrated in the bottom phase of a PEG 4000-ammonium sulfate system. However, it is well known that changes in the ions present can cause shifts in equilibrium concentrations of protein and other components between the upper and lower phases (34). In fact, Vernau and Kula (41 ) make use of this fact in a second step of their protein purification protocol. They were able to shift the protein concentration from the top PEG-rich phase to the bottom phase by replacing sodium citrate with sodium chloride. Thus, our results are consistent with the available literature. By preparing systems 1-4 (Table 2), but omitting PIPLC or adding myo-inositol or both (i.e., adding protein and myo-inositol), and comparing the volumes of upper and lower phases to those of systems 1-4, we detected volume differences only for variations of system 1, and these were small. Considering that modifications of system 1 occur nearest to the critical point P (see Fig. 2), the point where the property of a two phase system is most sensitive to variation in its composition (34), these

dehydrogenase, alanine dehydrogenase, R-oxynitrilase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and glucose-6-phosphate reductase) are concentrated in the upper PEG-rich phase. Since our conditions are different from those examined by Vernau and Kula, we have determined the appropriate phase diagram for the PEG 600-sodium citrate system. The aim is to provide a better understanding of the PI-PLC crystal growth conditions, and to provide a basis for minimizing complications (e.g., crystal imperfections and perforations arising from contact with multiple droplets of the second phase during crystal growth). The phase diagram for the PEG 600-sodium citrate system is shown in Fig. 2. PEG 600 and sodium citrate are both quite soluble in water, yet the two compounds together are incompatible and cause a separation into two phases when present in sufficiently high concentrations. By convention, the component enriched in the top phase is plotted on the ordinate and the component concentrated in the bottom phase on the abscissa. Mixtures with compositions below the curved line (binodial) produce a single homogeneous phase, whereas above this line, phase separation occurs. In Fig. 2, the points a-d are the total compositions selected to generate the binodial. The straight lines are tie lines. The line passing through a, for example, connects the points on the binodial representing the compositions of the two phases in equilibrium with the system of total composition represented by a. Volumes and densities of the phases, concentration of their components and distances on the tie lines AC and AB are related by:

* see annotation Table 1. The total systems further contained 23.2 mM HEPES. § 16.3 mg/ml of PI-PLC in 93 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, was added to the systems (I1-4) to give the indicated PI-PLC concentrations. In (3b) and (4), the buffer concentration was adjusted by adding the appropriate volume of 93 mM HEPES. At higher concentrations ofPEG 600 and Na citrate protein precipitation was observed at 4.1 mg/ml, therefore, 2.0 mg/ml PI-PLC were used. Volume of total system (1-4) prepared (V0), and volumes of upper (Vu) and lower (VL) phases measured after phase-separation. 'The concentration of PI-PLC in the upper and lower phases was determined spectrophotometrically (see Materials and Methods section). ** System (3b) also contained 54.5 mM myo-inositol.

small differences are not surprising. We conclude that additives (PI-PLC and or myo-inositol) at concentrations used here cause only minor changes in the phase diagram. Therefore, tie lines of systems 2-4 can be projected into the phase diagram and the PEG 600 and sodium citrate concentrations of upper and lower phases deduced. Furthermore, we find addition of myo-inositol to be without influence on the partitioning of PI-PLC between upper and lower phases (Table 2, 3b) . The presence of myo-inositol is not required for crystallization of PI-PLC as shown from our initial precipitant solution without myo-inositol. However, we find PI-PLC crystals formed in the presence of myo-inositol to be somewhat larger in size. The influence of myo-inositol on crystal growth might be via association with PI-PLC, for which we have indirect evidence from studies showing a weak inhibitory effect of myo-inositol on PI-PLC activity (43). However, any influence of myo-inositol is puzzling, since it partitions primarily to the lower phase. Applying this analysis of the PEG 600-sodium citrate two phase system and partitioning of PI-PLC between the phases to crystal growth, we then asked if it is possible to grow crystals using precipitant solution composed of upper phase only. A single phase system from which protein can crystallize would be useful when defined changes to the precipitant are to be made (e.g., addition of cofactors or inhibitors) to avoid problems arising from unequal partitioning of additives between the phases. In preliminary experiments, we prepared several total systems consisting of PEG 600, sodium citrate, myo-inositol and 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, and removed the upper phase. Adding these solutions to an equal volume of protein solutions, we were able to grow orthorhombic crystals of PI-PLC at 4°C by the vapor diffusion technique. The crystals obtained were comparable to those of Fig. 3. From the phase diagram, and assuming

vapor diffusion equilibrium with the well solution, we estimate the hanging drop contained between 36% PEG 600 and 0. 19 M sodium citrate to 42% PEG 600 and 0. 13 M sodium citrate. These results indicate that factors inherent in the process of phase separation per se, such as the presence of an interface or the gradual removal of citrate, are not essential for crystal growth.

A, b = 46 A, c = 160 A. These unequal perpendicular cell axes are consistent with an orthorhombic unit cell. The systematic absences and mm symmetry seen on all three principal axes are consistent with space group P212,2,. This space group has four asymmetric units per unit cell. The volume (V) of the orthorhombic unit cell is V = abc = 3.31 x I0 A3, and thus the volume of each of the four asymmetric units is 82.8 X 103 A3. Assuming one monomer of PI-PLC (35 kD) per asymmetric unit, the molecular volume (Vm) is 2.38 A3!/Dalton. This value is near the most common observed value of the packing parameter for known protein structures (38). Two monomers per unit cell would be highly unlikely because the corresponding Vm ( 1. 19 A 3/D) is well below the lowest observed value of this distribution. X-ray diffraction from orthorhombic PI-PLC crystals extends to 2.5 A resolution on our multi-wire area detector. In 48 hours, we collected the 20 A-2.8 A data summarized in Table 3. The statistics show a high completeness and redundancy. Between 20 A and 3 A, 9 1% of the independent reflections were measured, with each being measured an average of 3.5 times. The final R-factor of 0.046 indicates that data can be collected reliably to at least 2.8 A. We intend to pursue the three-dimensional structure determination of B. cereus PI-PLC using the standard technique of multiple isomorphous replacement, and the search for suitable heavy atom derivatives is under way.

We routinely obtain 12° screened precession photos in 24 hours. By aligning the long axis of the brick-shaped crystals perpendicular to the beam and taking still x-ray photographs, we found two principal zones. These are related to each other by a 900 rotation about the crystal's long axis. A third principal zone is obvious when the crystal is oriented with its long axis parallel to the beam. We determined the cell constants and space group of these crystals from screened precession photographs of the three major zones. All three zones (hkO, hOl, and Okl) have mm symmetry and a common set of missing reflections. In the central horizontal and vertical rows, only alternate reflections are present. In the case of the hOl picture (see Fig. 4), these reflections are h = 2n on the hOO axis and 1 = 2n on the 001 axis. Only k = 2n reflections are present on the OkO axis as judged from the Okl and hkO photographs. The spacings between layer lines on these pictures were measured by hand and indicate constants of a 45

CONCLUSIONS Two crystal forms of B. cereus PI-PLC are reported. This is evidently the first member of the large class of PI-specific phospholipase C enzymes to be crystallized. Small hexagonal crystals were grown from a single phase solution with PEG 8000 as the precipitating agent. Orthorhombic crystals were obtained from a more complex two phase system utilizing low molecular weight PEG (600 D) and sodium citrate. In order to provide a rational basis for understanding the crystallization process, the phase diagram was determined for the PEG 600 soTABLE 3 Data collection for the orthorhombic form of B. cereus PI-PLC

dium citrate system under the crystal growth conditions. Phase separation occurs spontaneously when PEG 600 and sodium citrate solutions are combined in the appropriate amounts, and it is not due to the PI-PLC. One effect ofthe phase separation, which occurs slowly in the hanging drop, is to concentrate PI-PLC in the upper PEG-rich phase, thus promoting crystallization. The phase diagram can be used to control the amount of the two phases present, and thus to minimize crystal imperfections caused by interference of droplets of the sodium citrate phase in the vicinity of crystals growing in the PEG-rich phase. Both crystal forms are suitable for crystallographic studies of B. cereus PI-PLC.
