Summary
A soil-borne bacterium exhibiting broad antimicrobial activity, including activity against MRSA, was investigated. The bacterium was identified using morphological, biochemical and genetic techniques. The 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate indicated that it was most closely related to Streptomyces lavendulae and Streptomyces globosus. DNA≠DNA hybridisation revealed 80% homology with S. globosus DSM41122. The antibiotic was partially purified from the culture supernatant using a combination of precipitation, charcoal and ion exchange. The antibiotic was found to be water-soluble and highly thermally stable at acidic pH. It inhibited the growth of S. lavendulae but not Streptomyces tenebrarius. Significantly, the partially purified antibiotic displayed activity towards clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, representative of the major clonal complexes. & 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Introduction
Bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces are widely recognised as industrially important microorganisms, and produce many commercially and medically useful antibiotics. It is generally accepted that the `golden age' of antibiotic discovery from actinomycetes has passed, since

fewer antibiotics are being discovered now than in the 1950s and 1960s, nevertheless these microorganisms remain a rich source of novel bioactive compounds; one study estimates that the number of antibiotics produced by the genus Streptomyces is of the order of 100,000, thus many more antibiotics remain to be identified (Watve et al. 2001). Investigation of actinomycete diversity in tropical rainforests using a combination of 16S rDNA analysis and morphological examination revealed that many of the isolates had only a distant relationship with known species, indicating the

Streptomyces sp. isolate exhibiting activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus presence of new taxa and an excellent source for novel natural product discovery (Wang et al. 1999). Furthermore, from the sequences of antibiotic gene clusters and the complete genomes of some bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces coelicolor), it would seem that such microorganisms are probably capable of producing a greater number of secondary metabolites than have been currently isolated from them. By altering easily accessible cultivation parameters such as aeration and media composition, several secondary metabolites can be produced by one organism (Bode et al. 2002). Despite these factors, it remains very challenging to obtain a novel compound using classical screening techniques, principally because of the rediscovery of known antibiotics. Thus, alternative screening methods are being employed, such as analysis of genomes and gene clusters that code for the presence of proteins typically involved in natural product biosynthesis but which cannot be assigned to any known metabolite (genome mining), and has resulted in the identification of the novel siderophore coelichelin from S. coelicolor (Lautru et al. 2005). Nevertheless, pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to commit resources to the development of new antimicrobial therapies. At a time when antibiotic resistance amongst pathogens is a chronic clinical problem, the diminishing numbers of new antibiotics being discovered is highly worrying. In this paper we describe the isolation and characterisation of a bacterium that exhibits strong antibacterial and antifungal activity, notably against MRSA, and describe some of the antibiotic's properties. 83

mended by Shirling and Gottlieb for the International Streptomycete Project (Shirling and Gottlieb 1966). In the carbon utilisation experiments the minimal medium recommended by Kieser et al. (2000) was used with L-asparagine replaced with (NH4)2SO4, and supplemented with various carbon sources. For electron microscopy ISP4 agar was inoculated with spores of Streptomyces sp. and incubated for 7 days at 28 1C. A plug of the culture was removed and fixed in glutaraldehyde (2.5% v/v), washed with water and post-fixed in osmium tetroxide (1% w/v) for 1 h. The sample was washed twice with water and dehydrated in ascending ethanol before drying in a critical point drying apparatus (Polaron E3000) and finally coated in gold and examined in a JEOLJSM 5410LV scanning electron microscope at 15 kV. Antibiotic activity of culture supernatants was determined by removing a plug of agar from a plate inoculated with the test organism and introducing antibiotic (50 ml) into the well. The plate was left at room temperature for 2 h to allow the liquid to diffuse into the media and was then incubated at 28 1C for 18 h. The antibiotic activity of the supernatant was assessed as the zone of clearing (mm).

Genetic characterisation of Streptomyces IMD2703
The 16S rRNA gene of Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 was amplified by PCR using the primers 16SF50 (50 -AACACATGCAAGTCGAACG-30 ) and 16SR1392 (50 ACGGGCGGTGTGTAC-30 ). Sequencing was performed either using a Beckman Coulter CEQ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing with Quick Start Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, or commercially by MWG. DNA≠DNA hybridizations were conducted by DSMZ, with isolate IMD2703 and S. lavendulae DSM40708, and with isolate IMD2703 and S. globosus DSM41122.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains
Strain IMD 2703 was isolated from Cambodian soil based on antibiotic activity. Streptomyces lavendulae DSM40708, Streptomyces globosus DSM 41122 and Streptomyces tenebrarius DSM40477, were purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen un Zellkulturen (DSMZ), Germany. The bacteria were maintained on slopes of tryptone soy agar (TSA) stored at 4 1C. Clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus were collected by D. Ashley Robinson, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.

Partial purification of antibiotic
Streptomyces sp. IMD 2703 was routinely grown in flasks containing TSB (50 ml), which were incubated at 28 1C shaking at 200 rpm. Additional aeration was provided by the inclusion of a coiled spring in the flask (Shannon Coiled Springs Ltd., Ireland). Fermentation broth (1 1) was acidified to pH 3 with HCl (5 M) while stirring. The broth was filtered and activated charcoal (1% w/v) was added to the filtrate. The mixture was stirred for 2 h and the charcoal was removed by filtration. The filtrate

84 was neutralised by elution from Amberlite IRA-96 anion-exchange resin using deionised water. The neutral eluate was mixed with activated charcoal (1% w/v), which adsorbed the antibiotic. The charcoal was washed with ethanol and resuspended in formic acid/methanol/water. The acidic filtrate was neutralised as before and concentrated by evaporation to yield a white solid, which was washed with excess methanol to extract the antibiotic. After removing the methanol under reduced pressure, oily, golden-yellow liquid remained, which was dissolved in deionised water (5 ml). The aqueous antibiotic was dialyzed in a Specra/Por DispoDialyzer with a molecular weight cut off of 1000 Da, for 18 h in deionised water. The dialysate was lyophilised and the yellow powder was dissolved in water to a concentration of 100 mg/ml. Quantification of antibiotic activity was determined using a method adapted from that of Hilton et al. (1988). Serial dilutions of both streptomycin (50 mg/ml) and antibiotic-containing supernatant (100 mg/ml) of Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 were used in bioassays with B. subtilis, and the dilution versus inhibition zone was plotted for both antibiotics, revealing comparable responses. The lowest concentration of streptomycin to create a zone of clearance (11 mm) was 5 mg/ml; thus, the units of antibiotic from Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 were defined as the inverse of the dilution factor of antibiotic generating a zone of inhibition equal to that produced by 5 mg/ml of streptomycin (11 mm). S.J. Higginbotham, C.D. Murphy spectrum antibiotic streptothricin and is often the predominant bacterium emerging from classical antibiotic screening programmes (Waksman et al. 1951), thus, it was necessary to obtain a more definitive identification of the isolate. The morphologies of the three strains on ISP4, TSA and glucose≠yeast extract≠malt extract medium (GYM) were very similar. However, comparison of the strains' micromorphologies revealed that S. lavendulae and S. globosus have straight to flexous aerial mycelia composed of long chains of smooth, oval spores, while Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 has tightly coiled aerial mycelia composed of long chains of smooth, oval spores (Figure 1). To definitively confirm the identity of the isolate DNA≠DNA hybridisation was conducted, and revealed that Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 has 79.8% DNA similarity to S. globosus. Since this is well within the threshold of 70% (Wayne et al. 1987), it was possible to identify Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 as a strain of S. globosus.

Partial purification and characterisation of antibiotic
Of a range of media tested, antibiotic production was best in TSB. Extraction of the culture supernatant with a variety of organic solvents and subsequent bioassay revealed that the antibiotic remained in the aqueous layer, thus is highly polar. The thermostability of the antibiotic activity in crude culture supernatant was examined and it was observed that at neutral pH the antibiotic was resistant to boiling but became inactive after 1 h of autoclaving; however, at pH 3 the antibiotic was resistant to autoclaving for 1 h. Furthermore, the antibiotic produced by Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 is active towards S. lavendulae, but not towards S. tenebrarius. These observations are characteristic of aminoglycoside antibiotics (Etienne et al. 1991). Uri et al. (1979) reported a presumptive test for putative aminoglycosides based on the effect of pH on the activity of the antibiotic. It was found that at acidic pH values, the antibiotics gave small zones of inhibition, which increased significantly around pH 5 and were moderately greater again at high pH values. This method was adapted to examine the antibiotic from Streptomyces sp. IMD2703. Aliquots of antibiotic-containing supernatant were lyophilised and dissolved in citric acid≠phosphate buffers (pH 3≠8) and phosphate buffer (pH 9). Bioassays were carried out in duplicate against B. subtilis. Gentamicin and streptomycin in buffer (500 mg/ml each) were used as positive controls and buffer alone was used as a

Results
Isolation and properties of strain IMD2703
Various soil samples were initially screened for antibiotic activity using a classical approach of assessing a crowded plate for zones of inhibition. Microorganisms that displayed strong antibacterial and antifungal activities were isolated and preliminarily identified by sequence comparisons of their 16S rDNA, so that any known antibiotic producers were easily identified. Strain IMD2703 exhibited a significant antibiotic activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and yeasts; most interestingly, the culture supernatant was highly active against a clinical isolate of MRSA. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene IMD2703 (1200 bp) with sequences in the GenBank database revealed that the bacterium was a streptomycete with 99% similarity to S. lavendulae and S. globosus. S. lavendulae produces the broad

increased from approx. 4 units/100 mg to approx. 100 units/100 mg. Thus, the purification resulted in a 25-fold increase in the antibiotic activity from culture supernatant. Bioassays were conducted using semi-purified antibiotic against a broader range of MRSA strains, which represented the five clonal complexes. Since the physicochemical and biological properties of the antibiotic indicated that it was an aminoglycoside, commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotics were included in the bioassays to compare their activity to that of the antibiotic from Streptomyces sp. IMD2703 (Table 1).

Discussion
We have described the isolation and identification of a new S. globosus strain that produces a water-soluble antibiotic that has a broad spectrum of activity, and is particularly active against clinical isolates of MRSA. The properties of the semi-pure antibiotic suggest that it is an aminoglycoside; however, its inhibitory effect on MRSA is distinctive from that of known aminoglycoside antibiotics, which have little or no effect on MRSA even at concentrations of 1 mg/ml. Exhaustive searches of the literature have revealed only one report of the antibiotics produced by S. globosus (Seo and Hong 1977), which described the identification of an isolate from a Korean soil sample based on its morphology and physiology. The strain produced a highly active antibiotic substance that was tentatively identified as a streptomycin-like substance based on its chromatographic behaviour, which, in contrast to the antibiotic produced by Streptomyces IMD 2703, was soluble in ethyl acetate.

surprising observation that such a small amount of work has been conducted in relation to the antibiotics produced from a readily available bacterium might reflect the morphological similarities between S. globosus and S. lavendulae, which is commonly re-isolated in antibiotic screens from soils. It is possible that strains of S. globosus have been mistakenly identified as S. lavendulae, and subsequently discarded. The determination of the antibiotic's structure is a clear objective.
