TFIIIB, which comprises the TBP and two other polypeptides, Brf1 and Bdp1, does not bind detectably by itself to TATA-less class III genes, but it can assemble on TATA-box containing genes and direct multiple rounds of transcription, in vitro, in the absence of TFIIIC (Margottin et al., 1991; Dieci et al., 2000). Interestingly, the presence of TFIIIC (but not RNA polymerase III) and clusters of B box sequences also mark boundaries between euchromatic and heterochromatic domains, which suggests an additional role of TFIIIC as a chromosome-organizing clamp (Noma et al., 2006). TFIIIC is an w600 kDa multiprotein complex composed of two DNA binding subcomplexes, tA and tB, of similar mass (300 kDa) and size (10 nm in diameter) (Schultz et al., 1989). Chromatographic separation of tA and tB has never been observed, but limited proteolysis yields a tB subcomplex able to bind tightly to the B block of tRNA genes (Marzouki et al., 1986). Recently, the reconstitution of a functional TFIIIC complex and the characterization of its tA and tB subcomplexes has established their polypeptide composition (Ducrot et al., 2006). Subunits t131, t95, and t55 form the tA subcomplex (Conesa et al., 1993; Manaud et al., 1998; Marck et al., 1993; Rameau et al., 1994), and subunits t138, t91, and t60 form the tB subcomplex (Arrebola et al., 1998; Deprez et al., 1999). Based on protein-DNA crosslinking experiments, the largest tB subunit, t138, was mapped over the B block and t91 at the most 30 location of TFIIIC-5S RNA gene complexes (Bartholomew et al., 1990; Braun et al., 1992). t138 is thought to be the DNA binding subunit (Gabrielsen et al., 1989), although B block binding also requires t91 and t60 (Ducrot et al., 2006). Subunit t60 was suggested to link the tA and tB domains and to interact with TBP (Deprez et al., 1999). A thorough understanding of the molecular details underlying preinitiation complex formation on class III genes has been hampered by a lack of structural information. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae t60 in complex with a large C-terminal fragment of t91 (Dt91). The cores of both subunits are formed by b propellers, which pack perpendicularly against each other in a previously unobserved mode of interaction. The b propeller domains of t60 and t91 are sufficient to form a B block binding tB complex. Biochemical studies suggest a role for the C-terminal domain of t60 in the interaction with TBP and for the N-terminal domain of t91 (missing from our structure) in nonspecific DNA binding. Interestingly, recombinant tB is able to recruit TBP on tDNA and to stimulate TFIIIB-dependent transcription of a TATA-box containing tRNA gene, which suggests an extended role of the tB subcomplex in preinitiation complex formation. Results Overall Structure of the t60/Dt91 Complex We initially tried to crystallize the intact t60/t91 complex but could only obtain poorly diffracting crystals. Limited

Summary Yeast RNA polymerase III is recruited upon binding of subcomplexes tA and tB of transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) to the A and B blocks of tRNA gene promoters. The tB subcomplex consists of subunits t60, t91, and ° t138. We determined the 3.2 A crystal structure of t60 bound to a large C-terminal fragment of t91 (Dt91). Dt91 protein contains a seven-bladed propeller preceded by an N-terminal extension, whereas t60 contains a structurally homologous propeller followed by a C-terminal domain with a novel a/b fold. The two propeller domains do not have any detectable DNA binding activity and mediate heterodimer formation that may serve as scaffold for t138 assembly. We show that the C-terminal t60 domain interacts with the TATA binding protein (TBP). Recombinant tB recruits TBP and stimulates TFIIIB-directed transcription on a TATA box containing tRNA gene, implying a combined contribution of tA and tB to preinitiation complex formation. Introduction In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase III synthesizes small, untranslated RNA molecules, including tRNAs, 5S rRNA, 7SL RNA, and several viral RNAs. tRNA genes, as well as other genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III, contain internal promoter elements named A and B blocks. Preinitiation complex assembly is initiated by the binding of the general transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) to the A and B blocks via two distinct DNA binding subcomplexes, tA and tB (reviewed in Geiduschek and Kassavetis, [2001] and Schramm and Hernandez, [2002]). Through its interaction with the B block, TFIIIC behaves as an enhancer and relieves repression by chromatin (Burnol et al., 1993; Shivaswamy et al., 2004). After A block binding, TFIIIC recruits TFIIIB at a fixed distance upstream of the transcription start site and, hence, indi*Correspondence: joel.acker@cea.fr (J.A.), mueller@embl-grenoble. fr (C.W.M.) 3 These authors contributed equally to this work. 4 Present address: Transcription Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PX, United Kingdom. 5 Present address: Synchrotron SOLEIL, B.P. 48, 91192 Gif-surYvette Cedex, France.

proteolysis led us to identify a stable fragment of t91 spanning 514 C-terminal residues (Dt91, residues 159­ 672), which retained t60 binding activity (Mylona et al., 2006). We crystallized this N-terminally truncated complex, hereafter denoted t60/Dt91, and solved its structure by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using a gold derivative. The structure ° was refined at 3.2 A resolution to a crystallographic R value of 21.2% and a free R value of 25.7% with good stereochemistry (Table 1). The refined model comprises t60 residues 2­588 and Dt91 residues 165­672. All residues are well ordered except for three loop regions in Dt91 comprising residues 320­337, 591­596, and 625­637. The t60/Dt91 complex has a cylindrical shape about ° ° 130 A long and varying in diameter from 40 A at one ° end to 60 A at the other. The larger end of the cylinder is formed by Dt91, which consists of a seven-bladed b propeller (residues 253­672) preceded by an N-terminal extension (residues 159­252). t60 consists of two domains, an N-terminal domain (t60-N, residues 1­398), which also adopts a seven-bladed b propeller fold, and a C-terminal domain (t60-C, residues 399­588), which has an a/b fold and corresponds to the thinner part of the cylinder (Figure 1). Interactions between t60 and

Structure of the b Propeller Domains The b propeller domains of t60-N and Dt91 are shown in Figure 2. Each blade consists of four antiparallel b strands designated A­D according to convention (Weirich et al., 2004), with the ``top'' of the propeller containing the interblade linkers. As in most b propellers, strand D of blade 7 is contributed by the N terminus of the protein, forming a ``velcro-like'' closure. Although WD repeats were previously detected in subunit t91 (Huang et al., 2000), a b propeller structure was unexpected for subunit t60. The t60 and t91 b propellers contain several large excursions between blade-forming strands. In t60, three extended loops embrace Dt91 and contribute to the large interface between the two subunits (see below). At the C-terminal end of the t60 b propeller, helix a7C is tightly packed between preceding residues and loop CD of blade 1, suggesting this helix to be required for the structural integrity of the domain. In the t91 propeller, blade 6 is extended by strand 6D0 and blade 1 by strand 1D0 , whereas in t60, such insertions are absent (Figure 2A). Blade 1 of the t91 propeller contains a large disordered loop (residues 320­337). This loop overlaps with a region containing 13 Cys and His residues (residues 328­411), previously suggested to bind Zn ions and form a DNA binding domain (Arrebola et al., 1998). However, we observe no Zn ions in our crystal structure. The t91 and t60 propellers can be structurally aligned ° with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 2.9 A over 256 residues. However, the t91 propeller has a more ``compressed'' shape due to blades 5, 6, and 7, whereas the t60 propeller is more uniformly round (Figure 2A). DALI searches (Holm and Sander, 1995) of the two b propellers against the Protein Data Bank also revealed hits with other seven-bladed b propellers, including the tran° scriptional repressor Tup1 protein (rmsd265CA = 2.7 A compared with t91 [Sprague et al., 2000]) and the ac° tin-like protein 3 (Arp3) (rmsd287CA = 3.3 A compared with t60 [Robinson et al., 2001]). Individual blades of the t91 and t60 propellers superimpose well onto one another, despite a low degree of sequence similarity (Figures 2B and 2C). Poor sequence conservation is a hallmark of b propeller structures (Jawad and Paoli, 2002) and explains why the propeller domain of t60 previously escaped detection. N-Terminal Extension and b Propeller of t91 Tightly Associate The N-terminal extension of the t91 propeller (residues 159­252) crosses the bottom face of the b propeller, closing off the tunnel formed by the blades of this domain (Figure 1A). The extension packs against blades 5 and 6 via three N-terminal helices before traversing the domain and extending blade 7 by strand 7D0 and blade 6 by the antiparallel strands 6D00 and 6D%. In the low-density lipoprotein receptor, N-terminal ligand binding repeats reversibly bind to a six-bladed b propeller and displace the bound lipoprotein ligand (Rudenko

et al., 2002). In t91, the extensive interface between the N-terminal extension and the b propeller makes such reversible binding unlikely. Instead, we consider the N-terminal extension as part of the t91 b propeller domain. A Novel Fold for the C-Terminal Domain of t60 The C-terminal domain of t60 (residues 399­588, t60-C) is formed by a helix bundle that involves consecutive helices a1­a4 and C-terminal helix a5 as well as by three small sheets (each formed by a pair of short antiparallel strands) packed against the helix bundle (Figure 1). The C-terminal domain represents a new fold because no significant similarity to any known structure was detected by using the programs DALI (Holm and Sander, 1995) and Combinatorial Extension (CE) (Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998). Comparison between the two molecules of t60 present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal shows a difference (corresponding to a rotation of about 4 ) of the orientation of the C-terminal domain relative to the propeller, which indicates some flexibility between the N- and C-terminal domains of t60. Such flexibility of t60 might be required to contact TBP during the recruitment of TFIIIB (Deprez et al., 1999). The t60/Dt91 Interface Complex formation between t60 and Dt91 buries a ° surface area of 3640 A2. The interface includes several hydrophobic contacts but is primarily hydrophilic in character, with over 20 polar interactions (Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Interactions are mostly mediated by residues located in

loops of the two subunits. The CD loop of t91 blade 4 (residues 498­503) inserts into the central tunnel of t60. This loop includes a short helix (a4) that mediates several polar interactions (Figures 3A and 3B). Additional interactions mediated by t91 involve strands C and D and the CD loop of blade 3, strand C and the AB loop of blade 4, and the DA loop between blades 4 and 5 and the CD loop of blade 5. t60 embraces Dt91 not only via two long DA loops connecting blades 1 and 2 and blades 6 and 7, and the BC loop in blade 7, but also through two shorter DA loops connecting blades 4 and 5 and blades 5 and 6. Trypsin proteolysis in the absence or presence of t91 identified the BC loop in blade 7 as primary cleavage site within t60 (Mylona et al., 2006). Residue Tyr358 immediately adjacent to the cleaved Lys359-Ile360 peptide bond is involved in the interaction with t91. Lack of proteolytic protection within the t60/t91 complex might suggest that t60 and t91 rapidly associate and dissociate in solution. In Dt91, the surface formed by blades 3 and 4 is negatively charged whereas that formed by blade 5 is mainly positively charged (Figure 3C). The corresponding interacting surfaces of t60 are positively and negatively charged, respectively. Thus, electrostatic complementarity may play an important role for subunit association. Interestingly, many of the t60/Dt91 contacts are formed through backbone atoms. Although many residues involved in the interactions between t60 and Dt91 are poorly conserved even among different fungi (Figures S1 and S2), the sequence conservation is sufficient to preserve the interaction surfaces as illustrated in Figure 3C.

Structure of the Yeast TFIIIC t60/Dt91 Subcomplex 225

Contributions of t91 and t60 in B Box Binding Although TFIIIC and its subcomplex tB bind strongly to DNA, direct binding to DNA has only been demonstrated for t91 (Arrebola et al., 1998). Using southwestern experiments, we showed that neither t60 nor Dt91 could bind DNA (Figure 4A), suggesting that the N-terminal domain of t91 missing from our crystal structure mediates nonspecific DNA binding, presumably through its AT-hook domain, which is also conserved in S. pombe and humans (Huang et al., 2000). These observations also agree with the predominantly negative surface charge of the t60/Dt91 complex, which is likely incompatible with the negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone (Figure 4C). To further investigate which parts of t60 and t91 are required to form a B box binding complex, the b propeller domains of both subunits corresponding to the N-terminal domain of t60 (t60-N) and the C-terminal moiety of t91 (Dt91) were expressed in insect cells. After coexpression of t60/Dt91/t138 in insect cells, a B box binding complex could be detected by gel-shift assay using insect crude protein extract (Figure 4B, lane 3). A reconstituted DtB complex was partially purified on heparin column and used for competition experiments, which demonstrated the specificity of its DNA binding activity (Figure S3). Subunits t60, Dt91, and t138 are sufficient to form a B box binding complex, demonstrating that the N-terminal domain of t91 containing the AT-hook motif is not required. We next tested whether t60-N when coexpressed with t138 and t91 was also sufficient to reconstitute a B block binding complex. After partial purification on a heparin column, a complex that binds to a tDNAIle probe was observed only in the presence of a bona fide B block (Figure 4B, compare lanes 7 and 8 with 11 and 12). Only about 3%­5% of the complex could be reconstituted with t60-N compared to full-length t60. Reduced binding to the tDNAIle probe probably results from the low-expression level of the t60-N construct (see Experimental Procedures) but might also be caused by the lack of t60-C. As in subunit t91, the b propeller domain of t60 (t60-N) is sufficient to form a B block binding complex, whereas t60-C is not absolutely required for complex formation. Interaction Surfaces of the t60/Dt91 Complex with t138 A surface representation of the t60/Dt91 complex (Figure 4C) shows that the most conserved regions lie on one side of the complex, whereas the opposite surface displays poor conservation. The conserved regions mainly involve residues at the ``top'' of the t91 propeller and close to the accessible side of the tunnel not blocked by the N-terminal extension. These regions might mediate interactions with t138. A temperaturesensitive mutation in the t138 subunit (Tfc3-G349E)

decreases the affinity of TFIIIC for the B box element (Lefebvre et al., 1994). The mutated glycine residue as well as the adjacent residues are conserved in S. cerevisae and S. pombe (Huang and Maraia, 2001). The thermosensitive phenotype of the Tfc3-G349E mutant can be suppressed and DNA binding and transcription defects of mutant TFIIIC can be alleviated in vitro through a point mutation, E330K, in subunit t91 (Arrebola et al., 1998). This residue is in a disordered loop (residues 320­337) of t91 that protrudes from a conserved region next to the tunnel entrance of the propeller (Figure 4C). It is therefore likely that this region is involved in the interaction between the t60/t91 complex and t138, and possibly, the tunnel of Dt91 plays a role in this interaction. This region is highly acidic, with a small basic region on the top of the complex surface, implying a possible electrostatic interaction between t138 and the t60/t91 complex (Figure 4C). Interestingly, the presence of an N-terminal His tag in the t60-N construct also prevents tB complex formation when coexpressed with t138 and t91. This agrees with an earlier report, in which the presence of an N-terminal HA epitope in t60 led to a thermosensitive phenotype (Deprez et al., 1999). In our crystal structure, the N terminus of t60 is located near the most conserved surface area of the t60/Dt91 complex (Figure 4C), and we suspect that in the complete tB complex the N-terminal extension of t60 also interferes with t138 binding. tB and TFIIIB Functionally Cooperate through a Direct Interaction between t60 and TBP A direct interaction between t60 and TBP had been previously shown (Deprez et al., 1999). We used pull-down assays to test which part of t60 might be involved in TBP binding. Ni-NTA magnetic beads were incubated with N-terminally His-tagged TBP and subsequently incubated with either full-length t60 or with t60-C. We observe similar binding of full-length t60 and its C-terminal domain to TBP, which suggests that t60-C mediates the interaction with TBP (Figure 5A). However, because the t60-N construct was so poorly expressed (see Experimental Procedures), we could not test binding of t60-N to TBP and therefore cannot entirely rule out that the b propeller domain also participates in TBP binding. To explore a possible role of the TBP-t60 interaction in the association between tB and TFIIIB, we made use of the tRNAIle (TAT) gene, which can be transcribed in a TFIIIC-independent manner (Dieci et al., 2000). In the tRNAIle (TAT) gene, the A and B box is preceded by a bona fide TATA motif. Surprisingly, under RNA polymerase III transcription conditions, TBP alone could not detectably bind the TATA box in the tRNAIle (TAT) gene in a gel-shift assay (Figure 5B, lane 9, and data not shown). In contrast, in the presence of reconstituted tB, TBP is recruited to the tB complex: addition of increasing amounts of purified His-tagged TBP resulted

Purified recombinant t60, t91, and Dt91 were analyzed on 8% SDS PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and then incubated with a specific (tRNA3Glu gene) or nonspecific (lacZ fragment) single-stranded (ss) DNA and doublestranded (ds) DNA probe as indicated. (B) Subunits t138, Dt91, and t60 are sufficient to reconstitute a functional DNA binding tB complex that can be detected by EMSA using crude insect protein extracts (left).

Lane 1, control without protein. The tRNA3Glu gene was used as DNA probe. The C-terminal domain of t60 is not required for the formation of a functional B box binding complex (right). Insect protein extract coexpressing t138, t91, and t60 or t60-N was separated on a heparin column by linear NaCl gradient elution from 0.1 to 1.0 M as described (Ducrot et al., 2006).

in the formation of a DNA complex of decreased electrophoretic mobility (Figure 5A, compare lanes 2 and 5). The presence of TBP in the complex was confirmed by a specific supershift detected using anti-His antibodies (Figure 5B, lanes 6 and 7), whereas adding anti-t131 antibodies did not result in a super-shifted complex (Figure 5B, lane 8). Using the same gel-shift conditions, we did not detect any interaction with the two other TFIIIB subunits Brf1 and Bdp1 (data not shown), suggesting that TBP is the only target of tB in TFIIIB. The binding of TBP is TATA-box independent, as the TBP/tB complex also forms on a tRNAIle gene deleted for the TATA

box (Figure S4A). In contrast, formation of the TBP/ tB-DNA complex requires the B box, and no specific complex could be detected with a tRNAIle probe lacking the B box (data not shown), indicating that TATA box and the protein-protein interactions involved are not sufficient to stabilize the TBP-tB-DNA interaction. Because tB was found to recruit TBP, we next tested the effect of tB on in vitro transcription of the tRNAIle gene (Dieci et al., 2000). Compared to the basal transcription in the presence of TFIIIB, adding tB stimulates transcription by a factor of 2, whereas a 7-fold stimulation is achieved when recombinant TFIIIC is added

(Figure 5C, lanes 3 and 6). In contrast, TFIIIC is still able to stimulate transcription in the absence of the B block, probably through the interaction between tA, bound to the A block, and TFIIIB (Figure 5C, lane 9). Subunits t60 and t91, alone or in complex, have no stimulatory effect (Figure S4B), indicating that the cooperation between tB and TFIIIB requires specific binding to the B block. Deleting the TATA box in the tRNAIle gene not only abolishes basal transcription but also transcription in the presence of tB, whereas in the presence of TFIIIC, transcription is reduced 2-fold (Figure 5C, lanes 3, 5, and 8), confirming the importance of tA in the TFIIIB assembly. Although tB presumably facilitates TFIIIB assembly, clearly, transcription activation requires the interaction with the TATA box for a proper placement of TFIIIB. Discussion DNA Recognition by the tB Subcomplex The overall negative surface charge distribution of the t60/Dt91 complex reinforces the notion that residues directly contacting DNA are located in subunit t138, which is highly positively charged (pI = 10.2) and had earlier been suggested to be the DNA-contacting subunit based on crosslinking experiments (Bartholomew et al., 1990; Gabrielsen et al., 1989). However, the reconstitution of a TFIIIC tB subcomplex able to specifically interact with the B block in tRNA genes requires not only subunit t138 but also the b propeller domains of t60 and t91, whereas the C- and N-terminal moieties of t60 and t91, respectively, are not absolutely required. In the tB complex, the t60/Dt91 propeller dimer probably provides a scaffold for t138 required for the stability of the tB complex, whereas t138 would directly contact DNA. The presence of large regions in tB dispensable for the reconstitution of a B block binding complex suggests that tB could be involved in other functions. Hence, the C-terminal domain of t60 that interacts with TBP could serve as linker between tA and tB and contribute to TFIIIB recruitment. The N-terminal domain of t91 containing the AT-hook motif could play a role in transcriptional termination, which in the RNA polymerase III transcription system is based on the recognition of runs of T residues (Cozzarelli et al., 1983). Subcomplexes tA and tB Participate in the Recruitment of TFIIIB Our results show that TFIIIC subcomplexes tA and tB both participate in the assembly of the TFIIIB-DNA complex, whereas earlier results had emphasized the role of tA in the assembly process (Bartholomew et al., 1991; Joazeiro et al., 1996; Kassavetis et al., 1990). The interaction of subcomplex tB with TFIIIB is mediated by a direct contact between TBP and subunit t60, which involves the C-terminal domain of t60 (t60-C). Individual contributions of tA and tB, in the assembly of the preinitiation complex, might vary in function of the promoter structure: in the absence of the TATA element, the TFIIIC-dependent TFIIIB assembly involves a stepwise series of interactions and conformational changes, mostly mediated by t131 of the tA complex and

Figure 5. The Association of tB and TFIIIB Is Mediated through a TBP-t60 Interaction (A) The C-terminal domain of t60 is sufficient for TBP binding. Fulllength t60 or t60-C (residues 399­588) was incubated with magnetic Ni-agarose beads preincubated with recombinant 63His fusion of TBP protein. One-fifteenth of the total input and the entire bound protein fraction were analyzed by western blot. The Ni-agarose beads retained specifically TBP (lane 4) and t60 or t60-C bound to TBP (lanes 7 and 8), whereas no retention of t60 or t60-C by the beads was detected (lanes 5 and 6). (B) TBP can be recruited by tB on the tRNAIle gene. Heparin-purified tB or affinity-purified His-TBP, separately or together, were incubated with labeled tDNAIle and analyzed by gel-retardation assay. Lane 1, control without protein. Lanes 2­5, tB with 0, 20, 60, and 100 ng of purified His-TBP. Lanes 6 and 7, tB, 100 ng of His-TBP, 50 ng, and 150 ng of anti-His antibody. Lane 8, tB, 100 ng of HisTBP and 150 ng of purified anti-t131 antibody. Lane 9, His-TBP alone. Lanes 10 and 11, His-TBP with 50 and 150 ng of anti-His antibody. (C) Recombinant tB can stimulate the basal transcription of the tRNAIle gene. The tRNAIle WT gene or the tRNAIle gene lacking the TATA Box (DTATA) or the B box (DBbox) was transcribed in vitro with TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III alone (lanes 1­3) or in the presence of tB (lanes 4­6) or TFIIIC (lanes 7­9) as described in the Experimental Procedures. The transcription level of each reaction, relative to the WT template (arbitrarily set to 100), is indicated below each lane.

(Figure 5C, lanes 1, 4, and 7), in good agreement with the 8-fold stimulation observed using partially purified TFIIIC (Dieci et al., 2000). In the absence of B block, no interaction could be detected between TBP and tB (see above), and as expected, no stimulation of the basal transcription is observed upon addition of tB

probably by t60 (Chaussivert et al., 1995; Deprez et al., 1999), which lead to Brf1, TBP, and Bdp1 recruitment at a fixed distance from the transcription start site (Kassavetis et al., 1990, 1992). Remarkably, in a minimal system comprising TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III, tB stimulates transcription of a TATA-containing gene, presumably by favoring the recruitment of TBP and TFIIIB assembly at the correct position. However, tB is not sufficient to stimulate transcription of TATA-less tRNA genes (Ducrot et al., 2006) or of a tRNAIle gene that contains a mutated TATA box (Figure 5C). In the absence of a TATA box, TBP can be recruited by tB, as shown by gel-retardation experiments. The resulting complexes migrate less rapidly (Figure S4), which suggests a difference in the placement of TBP, and are unable to direct accurate transcription. The presence of a TATA box and a B block is critical to observe tB stimulatory activity. These observations indicate that the role of the tB subcomplex is probably more complex than previously thought. In the current model (Kassavetis et al., 1992), Brf1 is recruited first by the TFIIIC-DNA complex and then recruits TBP in turn. The results presented here suggest that Brf1 and TBP could be recruited simultaneously by the TFIIICDNA complex. The Overall Architecture of the TFIIIC Complex Is Probably Conserved across Species Comparison of the RNA polymerase III transcription machinery between S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and human shows a high degree of conservation in the primary sequences of the different components (Huang and Maraia, 2001). In the tA subcomplex, S. cerevisiae subunits t131 and t95 have orthologs in S. pombe and humans, whereas for subunit t55 no orthologs have been detected so far. For tB subunit t91, the S. pombe ortholog Sfc6 served as linking sequence as it showed similarities with the S. cerevisiae and the human ortholog (Huang et al., 2000). Weak sequence similarity between orthologs S. cerevisiae t138, S. pombe Sfc3, and human TFIIIC220 has also been detected (Rozenfeld and Thuriaux, 2001), whereas for S. cerevisiae subunit t60, the similarity with human subunit TFIIIC90 is even weaker. Nevertheless, human TFIIIC90 is thought to be the functional homolog of S. cerevisiae t60, because both appear to bridge the tA and tB subcomplexes and to be involved in TFIIIB recruitment (Deprez et al., 1999; Hsieh et al., 1999). Evidence indicates that the t60 and t91 orthologs also contain b propellers in their N-terminal and C-terminal moiety, respectively. WD repeats have been predicted for the S. pombe and human orthologs of t91 (Sfc6p and TFIIIC110) (Huang et al., 2000; Sinn et al., 1995). Moreover, the propeller moiety of t91 aligns well with these orthologs (Figure S5), whereas the N-terminal moiety aligns poorly. According to this alignment, 75% of invariant or conservatively substituted residues are located in b strands or short turns and most deletions or insertions fall into predicted loop regions. For t60, programs SMART (Schultz et al., 1998) and Pfam (Bateman et al., 2004) also predicted isolated WD repeats in the N-terminal moiety of human TFIIIC90 and S. pombe Sfc9p, although the propeller region of t60 shows low sequence similarities with these ortho-

logs. Proteins with dissimilar sequences and with weak sequence repetition among the different sheets can form propellers (reviewed in Andrade et al., [2001] and Jawad and Paoli, [2002]) and indeed the PHYRE server for protein fold recognition (http://www.sbg.bio. ic.ac.uk/wphyre/) predicts a propeller fold for the human ortholog TFIIIC90. Hence, it is likely that all t60 and t91 orthologs form propeller structures and that the observed propellerpropeller interaction and, more generally, the overall architecture of the TFIIIC complex is conserved across species, suggesting a common mechanism in RNA polymerase III promoter recognition. Importance of the b Propeller-b Propeller Interaction In many cases, b propeller proteins can serve as scaffolds for protein assemblies. This is strikingly the case for the t60 propeller (Figure 3B). The interactions with t91 come almost exclusively from the loops and not from the b strand scaffold. Crystal structures have been reported for b propellers bound to proteins with different structural folds involved in signal transduction, transcription, and cell-cycle control (reviewed in Jawad and Paoli, [2002]). We describe the interaction between two propellers that appears to play a central role in the formation of the tB subcomplex. Other multiprotein complexes also contain several WD repeat-containing subunits. Examples include the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that contains the WD repeat proteins ESC and Nurf55 (Nekrasov et al., 2005), the COMPASS complex with WD proteins Cps30, Cps35, and Cps50 (Miller et al., 2001), and the SAGA complex with WD-repeat subunits TAF90 and Spt8 (Grant et al., 1997). In many cases, b propellers bind ligands or substrates at the entry of the central tunnel, and it is interesting to note that the interaction between t60 and t91 propellers also involves the tunnel entry of t60 that binds to the extended CD loop of blade 4 in t91. Interaction between b propellers might generally involve this ``interaction motif,'' and the architecture found in the t60/Dt91 complex might therefore be conserved in other multi-protein assemblies. b Propellers and Chromatin Remodeling TFIIIC is a multifunctional protein complex involved in promoter recognition, TFIIIB recruitment, and through its tB subcomplex, displacement of nucleosomes to relieve transcriptional repression (Burnol et al., 1993; Shivaswamy et al., 2004). Histone acetyltranferase activities for free and nucleosomal histones have been reported for human TFIIIC subunits TFIIIC220, TFIIIC110, and TFIIIC90 (Hsieh et al., 1999; Kundu et al., 1999), whereas S. cerevisiae and S. pombe TFIIIC do not have detectable HAT activity (Chedin et al., 1998; Huang et al., 2000). The mechanism by which yeast TFIIIC relieves chromatinmediated repression remains an open question, but it is interesting to note that propeller proteins can be part of chromatin-associated complexes. Recently, the association of the WD repeat protein WDR5 with a histone H3 tail methylated at K4 has been described (Wysocka et al., 2005). It is tempting to speculate that yeast t91 or t60 also associates with histone tails and is involved in the displacement of nucleosomes to relieve chromatin repression.

Experimental Procedures Data Collection and Structure Determination Purification and crystallization of the t60/Dt91 complex have been previously described (Mylona et al., 2006). The t60/Dt91 complex ° ° ° crystallizes in space group P21 (a = 61.4 A, b = 25.8 A, c = 210.5 A, b = 94.5 ) with two complexes per asymmetric unit related by a noncrystallographic dyad and 55% solvent content. Native and derivative data were collected at ESRF beamline ID29 on an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector and processed with program MOSFLM (CCP4, 1994). The structure was solved by the SAD method using a crystal cocrystallized with KAu(CN)2. All 12 gold sites present in the asymmetric unit were located by using program SHELXD (Schneider and Sheldrick, 2002) and confirmed by difference Fourier synthesis. ° Initial phases calculated at 3.5 A resolution with program SHARP (de la Fortelle and Bricogne, 1997) were improved by solvent flattening and 2-fold NCS averaging with program DM (CCP4, 1994). Phases were then transferred to the nearly isomorphous native data set ° and extended to 3.2 A resolution, resulting in an interpretable electron density map. Heavy-atom sites from the Au derivative and from a low-resolution Se derivative not used in the initial phasing provided useful markers for the sequence assignment. The atomic model was built by using programs TURBO (Roussel and Cambillau, 1989) and O (Jones et al., 1991), and refinement was carried out initially with program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and later with program ¨ REFMAC (CCP4, 1994). Iterative cycles of phase recombination, model building, and NCS refinement lead to a complete model with good stereochemistry (Table 1). The final model uses data ° between 30 and 3.2 A and has a crystallographic R factor of 21.2% (Rfree=25.7%). The model comprises two t60/Dt91 complexes (t60 residues 2­588, [second molecule, 3­588] and Dt91 residues 165­674 [second molecule, 167­674]) and five water molecules.

DNA Binding Assays and In Vitro Transcription Assays tB-DNA interactions were monitored by gel-shift assays as previously described (Ducrot et al., 2006) by using a 32P-labeled DNA fragment carrying as probe the indicated tRNA gene (wild-type tDNA3Glu or tDNAIle or one of its mutated forms: tDNAIle DTATA lacking the TATA box and tDNAIle DBbox lacking the B box). For the DNA binding assays, TFIIIC and TFIIIB subunits were expressed in insect cells as previously described (Ducrot et al., 2006). For construct t60N (residues 1­398), expression was severely reduced compared to full-length t60 as revealed by western blot analysis (data not shown), probably because the lacking C-terminal domain exposes hydrophobic patches. The amount of protein used in the gel-shift assays was 1 mg of total protein extract and 100 ng of heparin-purified tB. For the supershift experiments, 1 mg of anti-His antibody or of purified anti-t131 antibody was added to the mixture. To test the specificity of binding, a 250 bp lacZ fragment was used instead of the tDNA3Glu gene using the same conditions. For competition experiments, unlabeled DNA was added to the reaction mixture at the same time as labeled DNA. The lacZ fragment was obtained by PCR using plasmid pBluescript as template with the universal reverse primer and the M13(-40) universal forward primer as oligonucleotides. The tDNA3Glu probe was a 200 bp PCR-amplified fragment from the Puc-Glu plasmid carrying the tRNA3Glu gene (Gabrielsen and Oyen, 1987). Standard in vitro transcription of the tRNAIle wild-type gene was performed as described (Ducrot et al., 2006), using the following amounts of proteins: 0.5mg of partially purified B00 fraction, 20 ng of rTBP, 10 ng of rBrf1, 100 ng of highly purified RNA polymerase III, 100 ng of DNA plasmid templates, and when required, 20 ng of purified rTFIIIC (Ducrot et al., 2006) or 100 ng of heparin-purified tB, or 100 or 500 ng of purified t60, or Dt91 or Dt91/t60. All components were incubated for 20 min at 25 C, then NTPs were added and transcription was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 25 C. Transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel, and quantified by phosphorimaging. Transcription reaction mixtures contained saturated amounts of tB and TFIIIC.
