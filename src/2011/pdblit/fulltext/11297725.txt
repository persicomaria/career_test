Bovine F1-ATPase covalently inhibited with 4-chloro-7nitrobenzofurazan: the structure provides further support for a rotary catalytic mechanism
George L Orriss, Andrew GW Leslie, Kerstin Braig and John E Walker*
Background: F1-ATPase is the globular domain of F1F0-ATP synthase that catalyses the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate. The crystal structure of bovine F1-ATPase has been determined previously to 2.8 Å resolution. The enzyme comprises five different subunits in the stoichiometry 33; the three catalytic  subunits alternate with the three  subunits around the centrally located single  subunit. To understand more about the catalytic mechanism, F1-ATPase was inhibited by reaction with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBDCl) and the structure of the inhibited complex (F1­NBD) determined by X-ray crystallography. Results: In the structure the three  subunits adopt a different conformation with different nucleotide occupancy. NBD-Cl reacts with the phenolic oxygen of Tyr311 of the E subunit, which contains no bound nucleotide. The two other catalytic subunits TP and DP contain bound adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) and ADP, respectively. The binding site of the NBD moiety does not overlap with the regions of E that form the nucleotide-binding pocket in subunits TP and DP nor does it occlude the nucleotide-binding site. Catalysis appears to be inhibited because neither TP nor DP can accommodate a Tyr311 residue bearing an NBD group. Conclusions: The results presented here are consistent with a rotary catalytic mechanism of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, which requires the sequential and concerted participation of all three catalytic sites. NBD-Cl inhibits the enzyme by preventing the modified subunit from adopting a conformation that is essential for catalysis to proceed.

Introduction
F1-ATPase is the globular catalytic domain of the membrane-bound F1F0-ATP synthase; it can be detached intact from the membrane and hydrolyses ATP to ADP and phosphate. F1-ATPase is composed of five different polypeptides in the ratio 33 [1­3]. Their combined molecular mass is 371,000. 4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-Cl) (Figure 1) inhibits ATP hydrolysis by the bovine enzyme by reacting specifically with Tyr311, and complete inhibition is obtained by modification of this residue in only one of the three catalytic  subunits [4­6]. The F1-ATPases from Escherichia coli [7], the thermophilic bacterium PS3 [8] and chloroplasts [9] are also inhibited by the reaction of NBD-Cl with the equivalent tyrosine residue. The ATP synthesis activity of F1F0-ATP synthase is also inhibited by modification of Tyr311 with NBD-Cl [10]. NBD-Cl is highly reactive towards nucleophiles such as sulphydryl [4,11,12] and amino groups [13]. The Tyr­O­ NBD linkage is unstable at alkaline pH, and at pH 9.0 the NBD group transfers from the tyrosine to a lysine residue in the same  subunit [13]. This lysine has been identified

as Lys162 in the phosphate-binding loop (P loop) [14], and not Lys401 as initially proposed [15]. This transfer reaction can be prevented by reduction with sodium dithionite, which reduces the nitro group of the NBD moiety to the more stable amino derivative [5]. In the present work, F1-ATPase inhibited with NBD-Cl and reduced with dithionite has been crystallised, and the structure of the inhibited enzyme has been solved. In the structure of bovine F1-ATPase [16], the three catalytic  subunits alternate with the three non-catalytic  subunits, around the centrally located single  subunit. In crystals of bovine F1-ATPase grown in the presence of adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) and ADP, each of the three chemically identical  subunits adopts a different conformation, with different nucleotide occupancy. One  subunit (TP) has AMP-PNP bound and the second (DP) has ADP bound. The third  subunit (E) has no bound nucleotide at all despite the presence of excess nucleotides in the mother liquor. The  subunits are referred to as TP, DP and E according to the catalytic interface in which they participate. Many features in the

structure of bovine F1-ATPase suggest a rotary catalytic mechanism, in which the three catalytic  subunits are interconverted through different conformations by a rotation of the  subunit relative to the 33 subcomplex. The structure is consistent with Boyer's `binding change mechanism' of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis by F1F0-ATP synthase [17]. The rotation of the single-copy  subunit relative to the 33 assembly has been visualised directly in a bacterial 33 complex [18]. The structure of bovine F1-ATPase inhibited by NBD-Cl is consistent with a cyclic catalytic mechanism. The structure of bovine F1-ATPase covalently modified by NBD-Cl (F1­NBD) is presented here at 3 Å resolution. The enzyme was inhibited to greater than 99% by reaction with 0.1 mM NBD-Cl, and only one of the three  subunits, namely E, had reacted with the reagent at Tyr311. The corresponding residues in the DP and TP subunits are buried at the  interface with the adjacent  subunits and are inaccessible to the reagent. The inhibitor appears to act by preventing the E conformation from converting to a productive nucleotide-binding state. This proposal is consistent with a cyclic catalytic mechanism in which all three of the  subunits participate sequentially.

29.7%. Data processing and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The stereochemistry of the final model was good, with 86.8% of residues having mainchain torsion angles within the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot [19] and none in the disallowed regions. The final model consists of residues 24­510 for the E subunit, residues 24­400 and 415­510 for the TP subunit

Results and discussion
Inhibition reaction

The UV spectrum of the NBD-Cl inhibited enzyme has an absorbance maximum at 385 nm which is consistent with reaction with the phenolic oxygen of a tyrosine [4]. This treatment resulted in the loss of 80% of the initial ATPase activity within 10 min. After 45 min, more than 99% of the activity had been lost (Figure 2). Further incubation did not lead to loss of the residual ATPase activity.

Overall molecular conformation

The refined F1­NBD structure is very similar to the native F1-ATPase structure with bound AMP-PNP and ADP [16]. No significant changes were observed in the quaternary and tertiary structure or in the residues which form the NBD-binding pocket. A subunit by subunit comparison with the native AMP-PNP/ADP bound enzyme gave root mean square (rms) differences for all mainchain atoms of 0.56 Å, 0.58 Å and 0.49 Å for the TP, DP and E subunits, respectively, 0.41 Å, 0.58 Å and 0.53 Å for the TP, DP and E subunits, and 0.71 Å for the  subunit, compared with a value of 0.55 Å for the entire structure. The higher value for the  subunit is a reflection of the higher temperature factors associated with this subunit.
The NBD-binding site

Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. *Measurements with intensities differing more than 3.5(I) from the weighted mean were rejected. Rmerge = h i|I (h)­I(h)i |/ h i I(h)i, where I(h) is the weighted mean intensity after rejections. The contributing reflections were weighted by their standard deviations, which were determined by adjusting the measured standard deviation to reflect the observed differences between symmetry-related reflections. Hydrogen atoms were excluded. §The R factor is defined as h | Fo­Fc |/ h Fo, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively, and was determined using 98% of the data. ¶The free R factor [30] was determined from the residual 2% of the data.

The NBD-binding site is in the central nucleotide-binding domain of the E subunit (residues 83­363), but does not encompass sidechains that become involved in nucleotide binding in subunits DP and TP. The modified Tyr311 is found directly at the `open' E­E interface, with the NBD group pointing away from the E subunit towards the adjacent E subunit. The NBD moiety sits in a loose pocket (referred to as the NBD-binding pocket). The location of this pocket in the overall structure of the enzyme and a detailed view at the E­E interface are shown in Figures 3a and b, respectively. The NBD-binding pocket is quite open, with no hydrogen bonds between the protein and the NBD ring. Only two protein atoms, EIle343(CG2) and EAsp315(OD2), are within 4 Å of the NBD ring. This provides an explanation for the relatively weak density and high thermal parameters

and residues 19­510 for the DP subunit, residues 9­474 for each of the  subunits and residues 1­44, 77­90 and 209­272 for the  subunit.

The top of the pocket is defined by Val334, Ser335 and Thr340 of the E subunit, and residues Pro313 and Ala314 from the E subunit. Residue EIle343 is in middle of the pocket, and EPhe351, EVal312 and EAsp315 form the bottom of the pocket.

and tight sites, respectively. In the hydrolytic cycle each site proceeds unhindered between the open, loose and tight conformations cooperatively and sequentially, with all three catalytic  subunits participating in catalysis. It is clear from the structure, that only Tyr311 in the E subunit is accessible to modification by NBD-Cl. In subunits TP and DP, this amino acid is buried in the ­ subunit interfaces and is inaccessible to the reagent. The structure also shows that NBD-Cl does not act as a nucleotide analogue, contrary to a previous proposal [7]. It is 13 Å distant from the P-loop residues which are involved in nucleotide binding in subunits DP and TP, and it does not occlude the potential nucleotide pocket [20]. It would appear from the structure that the inhibition of F1-ATPase is due to the NBD group preventing the required interconversion between different conformations (Figure 5). The interconversion is blocked as an NBD group on Tyr311 cannot be accommodated in either the

The catalytic cycle of the enzyme requires concerted conformational changes in all three catalytic  subunits, in which they pass through the three states `open', `loose' and `tight' as proposed in the binding change mechanism [17]. The open site has a low affinity for substrate, the loose site has loosely bound substrate and the tight site contains tightly bound products. In the structure, the E subunit seems to correspond to the open site, and the TP and DP subunits appear to correspond to the loose

TP or DP subunits because the NBD ring would make unfavourable steric clashes with many mainchain and sidechain atoms. The synthetic and hydrolytic activities of F1F0-ATP synthase are both inhibited by modification with NBD-Cl [10], as both of these activities require the E conformation to convert to a productive nucleotidebinding state. Under alkaline conditions the NBD moiety can transfer from Tyr311 to Lys162 [13]. The NBD group is about 13 Å from this residue in the E subunit, and so it is unlikely that the NBD moiety is transferred directly in this conformation from Tyr311 to Lys162. If the E subunit were to begin to convert to conformations similar to those of the TP or DP subunits as the cyclic mechanism demands, however, then model building shows that a change in the 1 sidechain angle of Tyr311 can bring the NBD ester linkage within 3 Å of the -phosphate, facilitating transfer to the -amino group of Lys162. A similar explanation can be invoked to explain the transfer from Tyr311 to the thiol group of the nucleotide analogue P1-(5-adenosyl)-P2-N-(2mercaptoethyl)diphosphoramidate (AMEDA) [21]. In both cases, the requirement for a significant conformational change is consistent with the slow transfer rate that is observed (approximately 60 min in the case of AMEDA, and 5 h for the tyrosine to lysine transfer). There are conflicting results in the literature on the stoichiometry of nucleotide binding to the NBD-Cl inhibited enzyme. Cross and Nalin [22] found that three molecules of AMP-PNP could be bound at catalytic sites in the NBD-Cl inhibited mitochondrial F1-ATPase, whereas Weber et al. [20] report that only two catalytic sites are occupied in NBD-Cl inhibited E. coli F1-ATPase, even at high nucleotide concentrations. In the F1­NBD structure, nucleotides are bound at two catalytic sites, as in the native F1 structure [16]. Nevertheless, the possibility of nucleotide binding to the modified E subunit in solution cannot be ruled out on the basis of the nucleotide occupancy observed in the crystal structure.

shows that the three catalytic  subunits alternate with the three non-catalytic  subunits around the centrally located  subunit. Each of the  subunits adopts a different conformation, with different nucleotide occupancy. One  subunit (TP) has AMP-PNP bound, the second (DP) has ADP bound and the third (E) has no bound nucleotide. The structure suggested that the nucleotide-binding properties of the three catalytic sites of the enzyme were modulated by the rotation of the central  subunit inside the surrounding 33 complex. Guided by the structure, the rotation has been visualised directly in the 33 complex from a moderately thermophilic bacterium [18]. This rotary mechanism should be able to explain the modes of action of inhibitors of the enzyme. The crystal structures of F1-ATPase in complex with the antibiotics efrapeptin [24] and aurovertin [25] indicated that the mode of binding of both these inhibitors to F1-ATPase was compatible with such a mechanism of catalysis. Another inhibitor, NBD-Cl, inhibits F1-ATPase by covalent reaction with Tyr311 in one of the three catalytic  subunits. We report here the structure of F1-ATPase in complex with NBD-Cl (F1­NBD). The F1­NBD inhibited state shows that the reagent has reacted with the catalytic subunit, E, that has no affinity for nucleotide. The inhibitor appears to be preventing this subunit from being changed into a nucleotide-binding state, a change that would otherwise be brought about by the rotation of the  subunit in the active enzyme. Therefore, the structure of F1­NBD provides further support for the rotary mechanism of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis.

Materials and methods
Bovine F1-ATPase was purified according to Walker et al. [3], except that the Ultrogel AcA34 column was replaced by a Pharmacia HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg column. The purified F1-ATPase, stored as an ammonium sulphate suspension, was centrifuged at 30,500 g at 4°C. The resulting pellet was washed in 5 ml of F1­NBD buffer A (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM MOPS-NaOH pH 7.4, 4 mM ATP, 2 mM EDTA) to remove all traces of dithiothreitol. The inhibition of F1-ATPase (nonnucleotide-depleted enzyme) in F1­NBD buffer A was conducted according to [4], and its course was followed by measuring the ATPase activity assay, using an ATP regenerating system coupled to oxidation of NADH. The assay solution (1 ml) contained 83 mM sucrose, 33 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 6 mM potassium hydrogen carbonate, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM phosphoenol pyruvate and 0.25 mM NADH, to which was added pyruvate kinase (8.5 U) and L-lactate dehydrogenase (7.5 U). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the linear decrease in A340, using a value of 6220 for the molar extinction coefficient for NADH at 30°C. The reduction of NBD-Cl inhibited F1 with dithionite was performed as described in [5]. Bound nucleotides were removed from F 1­NBD according to [26], except that the glycerol concentration was 20% (v/v). Fractions with a total nucleotide content of less than 0.25 mol/mol F1, as determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay [27], were pooled and used in crystallization trials.

Biological implications
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of biology, and its synthesis is carried out by the F1F0-ATP synthase complex. In bovine heart mitochondria, the complex is found in the inner membrane. The complex is an assembly of 31 polypeptides of 16 different kinds [23] with a combined molecular mass of 660,000. The enzyme uses the proton motive force generated across the membrane from oxidative metabolism to synthesise ATP from ADP and phosphate. A detailed understanding of the biological mechanism of this enzyme has been derived from the structure of bovine F1-ATPase at 2.8 Å resolution [16]. The enzyme comprises five subunits in the ratio 33. The structure

This solution was placed in a microdialysis button. The outside buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM magnesium sulphate, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 0.002% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 8% (w/v) PEG MME 5000, 250 µM AMP-PNP and 5 µM ADP) was changed after three days, and the PEG MME 5000 concentration was increased to values between 10.5% and 11%. Crystals appeared after two weeks at 23°C. They were fully grown after six weeks, with typical dimensions of 350 × 150 × 100 µm.

Data collection
Immediately before data collection, ethylene glycol was added over a period of 7 h to the outside buffer in 4% steps, to a final concentration of 28% (v/v). X-ray data were collected from a single crystal at 100K on station 9.6 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK), at a wavelength of 0.87 Å and recorded on a 300 mm MAR Research image plate detector. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit-cell dimensions 281.0 × 106.6 × 138.8 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm), and had a mosaic spread of 0.45°. Data were processed using MOSFLM [28] and programs from the Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 suite [29].

significant positive density only around the hydroxyl of Tyr311 in the E subunit (Figure 6). The absence of any additional density around Tyr311 at this position in the native AMP-PNP/ADP bound F1-ATPase electron-density map, or in either the TP or DP subunits suggests that this feature is attributable to NBD-Cl. Coordinates for an NBD group were obtained from the entry GAKNEL [33] in the Cambridge small molecules database. A new entry was created in the X-PLOR dictionary for a tyrosine residue modified by NBD-Cl. The modified residue was built into the E subunit with the graphics program O [34] (Figure 7), with the bond length and angles for the ester linkage between Tyr311 and the NBD group taken from the DCPHER entry [35] in the Cambridge small molecules database. A third round of torsion angle dynamics was performed, to refine the position of the modified tyrosine residue. The solvent structure was then redetermined, and new water molecules assigned to positions of peaks in the difference Fourier map greater than 3.5, providing that these made suitable hydrogen-bonding contacts. A final Powell minimisation of the model including the solvent molecules was performed, and any refined water molecules outside hydrogen-bonding distance were excluded. The stereochemistry of the final model was verified using PROCHECK [36].

Structure solution and refinement
The structure of the F1­NBD complex was solved by molecular replacement. The aluminium fluoride inhibited F1-ATPase complex (KB, RI Menz, AGWL and JEW, unpublished data) was used as a starting model. Throughout the refinement of the F1­NBD structure, 2% of the data were used for calculation of the free R factor [30]. The starting model gave an initial R factor of 46.1% and free R factor of 44.7%. The model was then subjected to rigid-body refinement using the program TNT [31], and all data from 20­3 Å. Further positional refinement using data from 6­3 Å was carried out using the torsion angle dynamics option in X-PLOR [32], followed by positional and temperature-factor refinement using conventional Powell minimisation [32]. The water structure was then omitted to prevent model bias, and a second round of refinement by torsion angle dynamics was performed. After this initial refinement by X-PLOR, a search of the difference density map revealed
