The R-specific alcohol dehydrogenase (RADH) from Lactobacillus brevis is an NADP-dependent, homotetrameric member of the extended enzyme family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) with a high biotechnological application potential. Its preferred in vitro substrates are prochiral ketones like acetophenone with almost invariably a small methyl group as one substituent and a bulky (often aromatic) moiety as the other. On the basis of an atomic-resolution structure of wild-type RADH in complex with NADP and acetophenone, we designed the mutant RADHG37D, which should possess an improved cosubstrate specificity profile for biotechnological purposes, namely, a preference for NAD rather than NADP. Comparative kinetic measurements with wild-type and mutant RADH showed that this aim was achieved. To characterize the successful mutant structurally, we determined several, partly atomic-resolution, crystal structures of RADH-G37D both as an apo-enzyme and as ternary complex with NAD or NADH and phenylethanol. The increased affinity of RADH-G37D for NAD(H) depends on an interaction between the adenosine ribose moiety of NAD and the inserted aspartate side-chain. A structural comparison between RADH-G37D as apo-enzyme and as a part of a ternary complex revealed significant rearrangements of Ser141, Glu144, Tyr189 and Met205 in the vicinity of the active site. This plasticity contributes to generate a small hydrophobic pocket for the methyl group typical for RADH substrates, and a hydrophobic coat for the second, more variable and often aromatic, substituent. Around Ser141 we even found alternative conformations in the backbone. A structural adaptability in this region, which we describe here for the first time for an SDR enzyme, is probably functionally important, because it concerns Ser142, a member of the highly conserved catalytic tetrad typical for SDR enzymes. Moreover, it affects an extended proton relay system that has been identified recently as a critical element for the catalytic mechanism in SDR enzymes.

Complex Structures of R-alcohol Dehydrogenase

Introduction
R-alcohol dehydrogenase (RADH) from Lactobacillus brevis, a member of the extended superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/ reductases (SDRs),1≠3 is a homotetrameric enzyme with 251 amino acid residues (Figure 1) and a molecular mass of 26,627 Da per subunit. RADH was discovered during a search for biotechnologically interesting alcohol dehydrogenases.4 In fact, it can be used to produce valuable synthons for asymmetric organic syntheses, because it catalyses the enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones by NADPH to the corresponding secondary alcohols:

In this reaction, the residue R is typically a methyl group. The second residue, R 0 , can vary over a wide range and, in contrast to other biotechnologically relevant dehydrogenases, it can be a bulky group like phenyl.5 The preferred RADH substrate for in vitro studies is acetophenone, which is not accepted as a substrate by any of the commercially available alcohol dehydrogenases and which is reduced under RADH catalysis to R-phenylethanol with 100% enantiomeric excess.5

The three positions considered as determinants of the cosubstrate specificity are labelled with a plus sign.

803 the electron density quality around the substrate and cosubstrate molecules at the end of the refinements differed significantly but complement each other. Generally, while the protein chains were well defined by electron density in all crystals, the active-site ligands presented a partly disordered picture. In spite of numerous optimization trials following soaking and co-crystallization strategies, typically only the adenine half of the cosubstrate was well defined in the ternary complex structures. Nevertheless, information from the different structures about the nicotinamide part and the respective substrate could be merged to give a consistent picture. All seven structures were refined to satisfactory R-factors and stereochemical parameters (Table 1). ∞ The 1.00 A resolution structure of wild-type RADH ∞ and the 1.05 A resolution structure of RADH-G37D (numbers 7 and 1 of Table 1, respectively) are the best-resolved crystal structures of an SDR protein so far. This is particularly valuable, since genome sequencing projects have revealed that the SDRs are a highly abundant protein family.1 For instance, more than 60 SDRs have been identified in humans so far according to the Integr8 service at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Furthermore, their correlation with human diseases has become more and more obvious.10,11 In such widespread and biomedically important superfamilies, highly resolved structures of single representatives are particularly valuable, because they can serve as a basis for homology modelling. Structural adaptations upon substrate and cosubstrate binding A 3D comparison of the nine apo-RADH-G37D subunits in different crystallographic environments (eight monomers in the triclinic structure 6 and one monomer in the orthorhombic structure 5) revealed that the largest structural deviations exist in the cosubstrate-binding site (residues 35≠46) and in the substrate-binding loop region (residues 185≠210) (Figure 2(a)), which are obviously the most adaptable parts of the enzyme. In Figure 2(b) the structural differences between the apo-form and a ternary complex of the RADH mutant G37D are plotted. To guarantee that these differences are not crystal packing artefacts, we calculated this plot with two I222-structures. The structural deviations between the apo-form and the ternary complex RADH-G37D refer first to parts of the molecule that we have identified as adaptable just before (Figure 2(a)) and second to the region around Ser141. This position is followed by Ser142, which is one of the catalytic key residues typical for SDR enzymes.12 The role of this serine residue in the reaction mechanism is most probably to fix the carbonyl/hydroxyl group of the substrate by a hydrogen bond, but more active tasks have been

The current structural knowledge about RADH is ∞ restricted to a 1.79 A resolution structure of the apo6 enzyme. In that structure two divalent magnesium ions per RADH tetramer were found coordinated to the C-terminal carboxylate groups of the four protomers. Removal of these magnesium ions by chelating agents inactivates the enzyme,6 a fairly uncommon behaviour among SDR enzymes, which are normally independent of the presence of metal ions. To our knowledge, the only other reported example is the dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase from Salmonella enterica.7 In this enzyme, Mg2C was shown to be part of a novel dimerization interface not found in other SDRs.8 Also in RADH tetramers, each of the two magnesium ions is liganded by two RADH chains, which stabilizes the quaternary structure. Nevertheless, their removal does not affect the homotetrameric architecture globally.6 In contrast to this "metaleffect", the properties that make RADH biotechnologically interesting, its valuable substrate-specificity and enantio-specificity, are less well understood. One objective of this study was to explain these features on a structural basis and hence to provide a framework to improve the substrate profile by rational protein design. Regarding the biotechnological performance of RADH, our second intention was to understand and alter its cosubstrate specificity in such a way that no longer NADPH but NADH is preferred. The favourable economical consequences of such a switch are indicated by the price ratio NADPH/NADH, which is nearly 5, with a typical supplier for laboratory chemicals (Sigma-Aldrich). Moreover, the regeneration of the reduced form is easier in the case of NADH, which is a further advantage in biotechnological applications.5 Finally, in addition to these RADH-specific goals, the high diffraction quality of the published crystals of apo-RADH6,9 induced us to expect that RADH would provide the first atomic-resolution structure of an SDR enzyme and hence become a valuable matrix for homology modelling studies in one of the five largest protein superfamilies in nature. To address these items, we present here atomicresolution crystal structures of wild-type RADH and of the RADH mutant G37D, both as apoenzymes and as ternary complexes with bound substrate and cosubstrate molecules and we interpret these structures in the light of kinetic data.

Results and Discussion
Quality of the structures Seven structures, one of wild-type RADH and six of the mutant RADH-G37D, which had been designed to switch the cosubstrate preference from NADPH to NADH (see below), were obtained (Table 1). In some cases, the underlying experimental conditions were fairly similar. The corresponding structures are included in this analysis, because

proposed for this side-chain.8,13 Interestingly, an adaptability in this functionally most important region has not been described before for any SDR enzyme. In the following, we focus on the three parts of the enzyme marked in Figure 2(b) and discuss the structural basis for substrate and cosubstrate binding of RADH. Coenzyme binding and recognition Mutant design All "classical" SDR proteins are oxidoreductases,14 and can be classified into either NAD-preferring or NADP-preferring enzymes.3 The cosubstrate specificity has been assumed to be governed by three residues in the cosubstratebinding region.15≠17 The classical view was that two basic residues in the N-terminal region, one at position 4 of the conserved GXXXGXG motif

between helix aB and strand bA (equivalent to Leu16 of RADH; Figure 1) and the other in the loop between strand bB and helix aC (equivalent to Arg38 of RADH), determine an NADP dependency, while an aspartate residue in this bB/aC loop (equivalent to Gly37 of RADH) leads to a preference for NAD. Figure 1 contains one example for each case: mannitol-2-dehydrogenase (MtDH)18 is NADP-specific and has arginine residues at both locations; meso-2,3-butandiol-dehydrogenase (BDH)19 is NAD-dependent and possesses neither of these arginine residues but instead has an aspartate residue at a position equivalent to Gly37 of RADH. In the case of RADH, however, the "two basic side-chains" rule is not valid: its wild-type form is strictly NADP-dependent (Table 2), although it contains only one of the two basic residues, Arg38 in the bB/aC loop. A similar observation was reported for glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) from

Bacillus megaterium (Figure 1).20 Obviously, a basic residue in the GXXXGXG-motif is not really required for NADP preference. Equivalent conclusions were drawn by Kallberg et al. from a systematic clustering of SDR enzymes based on a multiple sequence alignment.14 For NAD-dependent SDRs, the critical role of the above-mentioned aspartate residue has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase.21 Therefore, we changed the glycine residue that RADH carries at the corresponding position (Gly37) to aspartate in order to obtain an NAD-dependent variant of the enzyme. This mutant planning, although originally done on the basis of sequence comparisons, was emphasised by the ternary complex structure of wild-type RADH (7 in Table 1): in this structure we found the 2 0 -phospho group at the adenosine moiety hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain of Thr15 and to the peptide group between Gly37 and Arg38 (Figure 5(a)). In contrast, the side-chain of Arg38 is not directed towards the phospho group of NADP. This observation supported our decision to alter only position 37 and to leave Arg38 unchanged. Kinetic studies of mutant and wild-type RADH We produced the mutant RADH-G37D and characterized it in comparison to the wild-type. The handling of the mutant was straightforward, meaning we did not observe any solubility or stability problems (formation of inclusion bodies, reduced thermostability) sometimes accompanied with site-directed mutagenesis.

We compared wild-type RADH and RADHG37D in kinetic studies and found that the cosubstrate specificity was indeed strongly affected by the mutation and, moreover, that it was changed in the predicted direction (Table 2A). Wild-type RADH has KM values for NADP and NADPH in the micromolar and thus physiological range (Table 2A), which has been reported for mouse lung carbonyl reductase,22 for 3b/17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 12 and for other SDR enzymes for the preferred cosubstrate, respectively. It does not possess any catalytic activity with NAD or NADH, while the mutant RADH-G37D shows dual-cosubstrate specificity, with a strong preference for NAD. This is indicated by a ratio (kcat/KM)NAD/(kcat/KM)NADP of 20, meaning the catalytic efficiency of the mutant is distinctly higher with NAD compared to NADP. In particular, the KM value for NADP increased by a factor of 607 (K M(NADP, G37D)/K M(NADP, wild-type)Z 9.1 mM/0.015 mM) by the mutation, whereas the turnover rate (k cat ) was nearly unchanged (Table 2A). Such a drastic change in cosubstrate specificity as consequence of a single mutation has been reported only once, namely, for the mouse lung carbonyl reductase, an NADP-dependent member of the SDR family.22 Further mechanistic implications It deserves a note that the affinity of RADH to the preferred cosubstrate as reflected by the KM values decreased by the mutation (Table 2A). The KM values of wild-type RADH for NADP and NADPH are in the micromolar range (15 mM and 40 mM,

respectively), but in the millimolar range for NAD and NADH in the case of RADH-G37D (0.75 mM and 1.6 mM, respectively). Interestingly, a parallel drop in affinity concerning the substrate can be observed when the kinetic constants for acetophenone and phenylethanol under saturation concentrations of the respective preferred cosubstrate molecule are determined (Table 2B). We found that the apparant KM values for either acetophenone or phenylethanol are about four times higher for RADH-G37D than for wildtype RADH (about 11 mM compared to 3 mM). A reduction in cosubstrate affinity is transferred to the binding to the substrate or, in other words, the binding affinities for the substrate and the cosubstrate are highly and positively correlated. This observation is consistent with a sequential

binding mechanism, as it is common in the SDR enzyme family.3 The cosubstrate binding site and conformational adaptations The cosubstrate binds to RADH in an extended conformation (Figure 3) similar to what is found in other members of the SDR family. The critical role of residues Thr12, Asp62, Asn88, Asn89 and Ala90 (in RADH numbering) in cosubstrate binding and catalysis, as proposed by Filling et al.,12 is supported strongly by the structure of RADH. In agreement with most other SDR complexes, they either interact with the cosubstrate directly or, in the case of Thr12 and Asn88, they participate in building up an extended proton relay system during catalysis

The region from Met140 to Ser142 is covered by the final (2FoKFc) electron density map contoured at 1 s. Of the two conformations, the one that resembles the apo-form is drawn with green carbon atoms, and the other, which represents the fully developed ternary complex, has blue carbon atoms.

808 (Figure 8),12 which we discuss in context of the active site architecture. The number of hydrogen bonds in the nicotinamide nucleoside moiety is similar to those of other SDRs, but lower than in tropinone reductase-II23 and glucose dehydrogenase.20 In these SDR enzymes, additional interactions between the substrate-binding loop and the cosubstrate have been discussed for stabilization of that loop region and formation of the active-site cavity before substrate binding. In RADH, neither additional interactions nor the presence of the cosubstrate are required for stabilizing the substrate-binding loop region, since it is fully structured and defined by electron density already in the apo-forms of wild-type RADH6 and of RADH-G37D presented here. It may be that the lack of contacts between the cosubstrate and the substrate-binding loop is the main reason for the relatively low quality of the electron densities in the nicotinamide nucleoside regions of all RADH ternary complexes that we investigated (see Figure 3 for an example). A surprising novel case of structural adaptability, which we detected both in wild-type RADH and in the RADH-G37D, but which has not been reported for any other SDR enzyme, is documented in Figure 2(b) and Figure 4: Ser141, which precedes the catalytic key residue Ser142, is able to adopt two different conformations in the side-chain and in the main-chain. In all three atomic-resolution ternary complex structures of Table 1 (structures 1, 2 and 7) these two conformations exist simultaneously. Furthermore, a water molecule (Wat122 in Figure 4) is found that is absent from the structures of the apo-forms and that may participate in building up a proton relay system (Figure 8, see below for a discussion). The adaptability of the Ser141/Ser142 region is underlined by the fact that we found each of the two conformations shown in Figure 4 also in pure form: the conformation with blue carbon atoms in which the backbone carbonyl group of Ser141 is turned away from the cosubstrate and the water molecule (Wat122) is present in the ternary complex of ∞ RADH-G37D refined at 1.78 A resolution (4 in Table 1), while the other conformation (green carbon atoms in Figure 4) with a Ser141 carbonyl group pointing towards the cosubstrate binding site exists in the structure of apo-RADH-G37D (5 in Table 1). This observation suggests that Ser141 changes its backbone conformation to generate space for the cosubstrate and for the additional water molecule (Wat122 in Figure 4). Structural basis of the cosubstrate specificity In the ternary complex structures of RADHG37D, the negative side-chain inserted at position 37 forms hydrogen bonds to the 2 0 -hydroxyl group of the adenine ribose moiety of NAD (Figure 5(b)). It interacts with Arg38 and Thr15, and with a water molecule (Wat271 in Figure 5(b)), and assumes a role analogous to that of the phospho moiety of

Complex Structures of R-alcohol Dehydrogenase

NADP in the wild-type structure (Figure 5(a)). This observation is fully consistent with our kinetic data (Table 2A): First, it explains the much lower affinity of the mutant G37D towards NADP (Km Z9.1 mM) compared to NAD (KmZ0.75 mM), since a comparison of Figure 5(a) and (b) suggests that the binding of NADP to the mutant leads to steric and charge repulsion problems. Second, it indicates why wild-type RADH is unable to work with NAD or NADH, for in this case a negatively charged group is missing at the 2 0 -phosphate binding site, so that the adenine ribose group has no anchor point. Taken together, our protein design work with

The bound R-phenylethanol molecule and surrounding residues are covered by the final (2FoKFc) electron density contoured at 0.65 s. The electron density map is coloured blue for the substrate and grey for enzyme. A hydrogen bond is indicated by a dotted magenta line.

RADH supports the view that a single basic residue, rather than two, is sufficient to determine the NADP-dependence of an SDR enzyme.13 Furthermore, it shows that the introduction of a single negative charge directly upstream of the normally NADP-recognizing arginine residue can mask its role and switch the cosubstrate preference towards NAD. Substrate binding and recognition The binding site for the substrate is formed by the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(P) and a hydrophobic patch on the enzyme surface, more precisely at the interface of helix aG and the loop between strand bE and helix aF. The phenyl ring of phenylethanol interacts with hydrophobic side-chains (Ala93, Leu152, Val195, Leu198 and Met205; Figure 6) and with the aromatic ring of Tyr189, while its hydroxyl ∞ group forms a hydrogen bond (distance 3.3 A) with the terminal hydroxyl group of Tyr155, which is the most conserved residue of the whole SDR superfamily and the established catalytic base of the oxidative reaction direction.12 In contrast, the distance to the hydroxyl group of Ser142, like Tyr155 a member of the catalytic tetrad,12 is, at ∞ more than 5 A, conspicuously large, in particular in comparison to ternary complex structures of other SDRs.8,13 This finding, together with partial disorder of the bound substrate and cosubstrate molecules, indicates that we did not trap the fully productive state of the ternary complex. The substrate-binding loop that comprises the surface helices aFG1 and aFG2 (Figure 1) is involved in crystal-packing contacts in the case of the I222 crystals. This observation explains why this region, although identified as the most flexible part of RADH in Figure 2(a), shows no marked change of the backbone conformation upon ternary complex formation in the crystalline state (Figure 2(b)). Nevertheless, a closer look (Figure 7) reveals that

some side-chains change their conformations significantly: the aromatic side-chain of Tyr189 is rotated towards phenylethanol and touches its phenyl ring; Glu144 turns away from the substrate first to leave space for the methyl group of the substrate and second to present its hydrophobic methylene groups in that direction; and Met205 accompanies the motion of Tyr189 and interacts afterwards with the phenyl group of the substrate. What confuses the picture a bit is the fact that all three side-chains are present with two alternative conformations, meaning that it looks as if we analysed a crystalline state in which the apoenzyme is overlaid with the ternary complex, or at least an intermediate state, on the way to the ternary complex. Obviously, the crystalline environment strongly stabilizes the, in many SDR structures disordered, substrate-binding loop, resulting in excellent diffraction properties but a loss of adaptability and, therefore, a low affinity for the substrate and the nicotinamide part of the cosubstrate. The methyl group of the bound phenylethanol is covered in all directions and has reasonable ∞ ∞ distances, between 3.5 A and 4 A, to atoms of surrounding side-chains (Leu152, Glu144, Tyr155 and Tyr189) and of NAD. There is little space for a larger group, which is consistent both with the enzymes's preference for a methyl group5,24 and with the enantiospecificity of the enzyme: RADH binds acetophenone exclusively in such a way that R-phenylethanol is formed. In contrast to the methyl group, the phenyl ring of phenylethanol is not covered completely by the hydrophobic side-chains mentioned above. It points towards the solvent, in agreement with the substrate profile of RADH:5 for instance, a chloro substituent at position 2 of the phenyl ring of acetophenone, i.e. in the region of the hydrophobic coat, drops the activity to 10% compared to acetophenone. In contrast, a chlorine atom attached to one of the outer positions 3 or 4 is even

Figure 7. Stereo picture illustrating the structural adaptions of RADH-G37D during the formation of the ternary complex. The structures of apo-RADH-G37D (no. 5 of Table 1; green atoms) and ternary complex RADH-G37D (no. 1 of Table 1; blue atoms) have been superimposed. As mentioned in the text, the ternary complex structure contains several regions with alternative conformations (example the main-chain around Ser141 or the side-chain of Tyr189); here, the predominant conformation is drawn. Particularly conspicuous are the structural adaptations of Ser141, Glu144, Tyr189 and Met205.

stimulatory. In summary, the environment of the phenyl group, in particular the vicinity to the aromatic side-chain of Tyr189, correlates well with the biotechnologically most valuable property of RADH, namely, its ability to transform prochiral ketones with bulky and especially aromatic sidechains. Active-site architecture On the basis of sequence comparisons, chemical modifications, structure determinations and mutational analyses, several residues essential for the catalytic mechanism in SDR enzymes have been identified. We have already mentioned the term "catalytic tetrad" according to the most recent model for the mechanism of SDR catalysis12 but a closer look at the SDR literature reveals that the number of those key residues and their roles are ®rnvall matters of continuous discussion. In 1995, Jo et al. explained a mechanism based on two conserved residues, Tyr155 and Lys159 in RADH numbering (Figure 1).3 According to this model, Tyr155 serves as a catalytic acid in the reductive reaction direction; it is deprotonated in the course of the reaction and needs stabilization by the positively charged Lys159 for this purpose. Later, the Tyr/Lys-couple was extended by inclusion of a serine residue (Ser142 in RADH) to form a catalytic triad. The function of this serine residue, however, is not completely clear. From a chemical point of view it is not necessary to postulate such an additional aliphatic hydroxyl group. In fact, the RADH ternary complex structures with the above-mentioned long distance between Ser142 and the bound substrate alone provide no indication that it plays a role in the catalytic mechanism at all. However, we mentioned already the possibility that this observation may be the result of a crystallization artefact, in particular since in other ternary complex structures of SDRs

the hydroxyl group of the serine (or threonine) residue equivalent to Ser142 of RADH is in close hydrogen bonding distance to the carbonyl or hydroxyl oxygen atom of the respective substrate.8,13 Therefore, the common view is that this side-chain is necessary to fix the substrate. Furthermore, Blankenfeldt et al. proposed that the serine residue tunes the pKa values of the catalytic tyrosine residue and the substrate in such a way that they finally match.8 As a consequence, a very close "low barrier hydrogen-bond",25 in which a proton is effectively shared between two binding partners, can be formed in the transition state. The validity of this and other models could be checked by a determination of the exact hydrogen atom positions by neutron diffraction. The high-quality RADH crystals described here could serve as a basis of such experiments. Coming back to the increasing cluster of catalytic key residues, Filling et al. finally pointed to a conserved asparagine residue (Asn113 in RADH).12 They proposed a "proton relay system" that includes the "tetrad" composed of the catalytic triad plus the aforesaid asparagine residue, the 2 0 -OH-group of NAD(P) and a water molecule that is bound simultaneously to the lysine residue and to the asparagine residue of the catalytic tetrad. Filling et al. identified such a water molecule in a bacterial 3b/17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and in several other SDR structures from the protein data base.12 We supplement this list here with the structures of RADH that contain a water molecule at an equivalent position (Wat48 in Figure 8). Moreover Filling et al. postulated the existence of an "extended proton relay system", which allows the rapid transfer of a proton from the bulk solvent to the active site, where it is consumed in the reductive reaction direction.12 This extended proton relay system comprises a cluster of several water molecules filling a hydrophilic cavity

resulting two gene-specific PCR pieces, both carrying the site-specific mutation, were fused together in a followup PCR reaction using equal amounts (picomolar) of each gene-specific DNA piece and no additional primer for the first five cycles. This guaranteed the elongation into the whole gene starting from the only overlapping sequence, the mutated primer region. After five cycles, the N and C-terminal primers were added, and exponential amplification of the whole gene, now with the incorporated mutation on both strands was achieved. The mutated gene was cloned, according to the wild-type gene, into the pkk177-3H vector, and Escherichia coli HB101 cells were used for transformation. The altered RADH sequence at position G37 was verified by sequencing the new construct. Expression, purification and crystallization Wild-type RADH was expressed recombinantly and purified as described.4 Purified RADH was concentrated and rebuffered by ultrafiltration against a solution of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgCl2. The final concentration of protein in the RADH stock solution for crystallization setups was 15 mg/ml. The ternary complex of wild-type RADH was crystallized using acetophenone and NADP as additives for co-crystallization and PEG400 or PEGMME550 as precipitant. The best condition was 21% (w/v) polyethyleneglycol monomethyl ether (PEGMME) 550, 0.1 M Tris≠HCl (pH 8.9), 50 mM MgCl2, 40 mM acetophenone and 10 mM NADP. The crystals grew within three weeks to a maximum size of 0.25 mm!0.25 mm!1.0 mm. The mutant RADH-G37D was purified to homogeneity using a new four-step purification protocol (anionexchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, coupled cation/anion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography).26 Purified RADHG37D was concentrated and rebuffered by ultrafiltration against a solution of 20 mM triethanolamine≠HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM NaCl. The final protein concentration in the RADH-G37D stock solution for the crystallization setups was 21 mg/ml. The apoenzyme could be crystallized using methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), PEG 400 or PEGMME 550 as precipitant. The best condition was 20% (w/v) PEG 400, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mM MgCl2. The ternary complex was crystallized using phenylethanol and NAD/NADH as additives for co-crystallization, and PEG400 or PEGMME550 as precipitant. The best conditions were: first, 25% PEGMME 550, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 6.5), 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM phenylethanol, 25 mM NADH; and second, 35% PEG 400, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0), 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM phenylethanol, 25 mM NADH. The crystals grew within one week to a maximum size of 0.4 mm!0.5 mm!1.7 mm. All crystallization experiments were performed at 16 8C according to the sitting-drop variant of the vapourdiffusion method. For X-ray measurements at cryogenic temperatures, the concentration of PEGMME 550 or the PEG 400 in the reservoir was increased stepwise to 40%. Diffraction data collection and processing Diffraction data for the ternary complex of wild-type RADH were collected at the BW7B synchrotron beamline of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) outstation in Hamburg, Germany, using a MAR345 ∞ imaging plate detector and a wavelength of 0.8439 A.

that is coated by a number of backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms and side-chain hydroxyl groups belonging to well conserved residues. The arrangement of these protein and solvent elements as occuring in RADH is drawn in Figure 8. Taken together, the high-resolution structures of RADH are consistent with the mechanistic notions of Filling et al.12 They even extend this concept, since they provide the first indication for a conformational flexibility next to the serine member of the catalytic tetrad (Figures 2(b), 4 and 7). In this way, the necessary space for an additional water molecule between the catalytic tyrosine residue and the 2 0 -hydroxyl group of the NAD nicotinamide nucleoside moiety (Wat122 in Figures 4 and 8) is created. This water molecule may be a further, and so far unknown, component of the "extended proton relay system".12

Material and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis The mutant RADH-G37D was constructed using regular PCR with site-specific mutation primers for both DNA strands and a follow-up fusion PCR reaction. The wild-type gene of the Lactobacillus brevis RADH was used as a template and divided into two separate amplification products, one yielding partial gene amplification between the N-terminal primer (5 0 -GCGCGAATTCATGTC TAACCGTTTGGATGGTAAGGTAGCA) and the antisense mutation primer (5 0 -AACATCGCTGTGCCGGT CGGTAATCATGACCTT), the second one yielding partial gene amplification between the sense mutation primer (5 0 -AAGGTCATGATTACCGACCGGCACAGCGATGTT) and the C-terminal primer (5 0 -GCGCAAGCTTCTAC TATTGAGCAGTGTAGCCACCGTCAACTACG).

In the case of RADH-G37D, two datasets of the apoenzyme and four datasets of ternary complexes were measured. The two apo-enzyme data sets (5 and 6 in Table 1) and two of the four ternary complex data sets (3 and 4 in Table 1) were collected at 100 K with a DIP2030 imaging plate detector (MacScience) and Cu Ka radiation generated by a Nonius FR591 rotating anode diffractometer. Two high-resolution data-sets of ternary complexes (1 and 2 of Table 1) were collected with ∞ synchrotron radiation (wavelength 0.9155 A) at the beamline ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) with an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector. All diffraction data were processed using XDISP, DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL package.27 The scaled diffraction intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes with TRUNCATE from the CCP4 program suite.28 Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the processed data sets. Structure solution and refinement The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the corresponding routines of CNS29 and the structure of apo-RADH (PDB code 1NXQ) as a search model.6 They were refined initially with CNS.29 For the triclinic crystal form (6 in Table 1), non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied, which were relaxed in the course of the refinement, and finally excluded completely for the regions in which strong structural deviations were clearly proven by the electron density. In the case of the six structures with I222 crystal symmetry, REFMAC30 from the CCP4 suite28 was used for the final refinement. Manual model building was performed with O.31 Anisotropic B-factors were refined in the case of all ∞ datasets with resolution better than 1.6 A. 32 NAD and NADH were refined with the same parameter files because in spatial and temporal average the six carbon ring of NADH looks just as flat as that of NAD. Structure validation, interpretation and documentation The stereochemical quality of the structures was checked with PROCHECK33 from the CCP4 suite.28 The relevant parameters are documented in Table 1. The final atomic coordinates and the corresponding experimental structure factor amplitudes were submitted to the Protein Data Bank.34 The respective PDB codes are given in Table 1. The multiple structural alignment shown in Figure 1 was calculated with STAMP35 and the least-squaresminimized average RMS deviations for main-chain atoms plotted in Figure 2 with LSQKAB from the CCP4 suite.28 All other structural overlays illustrated in the Figures were calculated with the LSQ options of O.31 The structure pictures (Figures 3≠8) were drawn with MOLSCRIPT36 or BOBSCRIPT37 (if they include electron densities) in combination with the rendering program Raster3D.38 Assays of RADH enzymatic activity The interconversions between phenylethanol and acetophenone on the one hand and between NAD/ NADP and NADH/NADPH on the other were used as assay reactions to characterize wild-type RADH and the mutant RADH-G37D (Table 2). The reactions were followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 MK1 cm K1 for

NADH or NADPH. The reaction temperature was 30 8C in all cases. The reaction mixtures contained 100 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer at pH 7.0. Prior to the reaction, the enzyme preparation was diluted with 0.1 M Tris≠HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mM MgCl2. All reactions were performed under pseudo-first-order conditions, meaning that the concentration of one of the reaction partners was varied to determine the corresponding Km value, while the other was added in great excess. All measurements were made in triplicate. KM and kcat values were determined with the program GRAFIT (Erithacus Software Ltd, Horley, UK). The protein concentrations of the enzyme preparations were determined by measuring UV absorption at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 19,300 MK1 cmK1, which had been calculated from the amino acid sequence.
