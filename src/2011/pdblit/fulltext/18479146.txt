ABSTRACT:

The high-temperature requirement A (HtrA) family of serine proteases has been shown to play an important role in the environmental and cellular stress damage control system in Escherichia coli. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has three putative HtrA-like proteases, HtrA1, HtrA2, and HtrA3. The deletion of htrA2 gives attenuated virulence in a mouse model of TB. Biochemical analysis reveals that HtrA2 can function both as a protease and as a chaperone. The three-dimensional structure of HtrA2 determined at 2.0 Å resolution shows that the protease domains form the central core of the trimer and the PDZ domains extend to the periphery. Unlike E. coli DegS and DegP, the protease is naturally active due to the formation of the serine protease-like catalytic triad and its uniquely designed oxyanion hole. Both protease and PDZ binding pockets of each HtrA2 molecule are occupied by autoproteolytic peptide products and reveal clues for a novel autoregulatory mechanism that might have significant importance in HtrA-associated virulence of Mtb.

Bacterial survival in environmental extremes, including high temperature and oxidative stress, depends on the activities of periplasmic proteases and chaperones (1­7). The HtrA1 proteins are comprised of a family of periplasmic heat shock proteins with both protease and chaperone activity (5­10). HtrA proteins have been identified in many organisms, from Archaea to humans. Members of this protein family all share a highly conserved serine protease domain containing an active site catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp) and one or more C-terminal PDZ domains (9, 10). PDZ domains are protein

modules that mediate specific protein­protein interactions and usually bind three or four C-terminal residues of the target protein (11­14). Accumulated evidence indicates that the PDZ domains can both positively and negatively regulate the protease activity of HtrA proteins (15­17). HtrA proteases play important roles in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli as part of the stress response system involving the Cpx two-component system (18, 19) and E pathway (17, 20). For example, DegP is part of E. coli's extracytoplasmic stress response system and acts on several misfolded native gene products, including alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) (21), DsbA (22), and maltose-binding protein variants MalS and MalE (4, 8, 23). The diversity of substrates implies that DegP plays a central role in the stability and turnover of periplasmic proteins. DegS and DegQ are two other HtrA enzymes found in E. coli. DegS senses the stress

M. tuberculosis HtrA2 and triggers the E stress response pathway (17, 20, 24), while the specific role of DegQ is not yet known. HtrA homologues have also been found in many Grampositive bacteria and are shown to be important in virulence (25­28). However, the functions of these proteins in Gram-positive bacteria remain unclear. Homologues of HtrA are also present in mycobacteria, which are related to Gram-positive bacteria yet have many Gram-negative characteristics, including a periplasmic space (29). The genome of Mtb contains three genes that encode HtrA serine proteases: RV1223 (htrA1), RV0983 (htrA2), and RV0125 (htrA3). The predicted amino-terminal transmembrane region suggests that, like the E. coli HtrA proteins, all three Mtb enzymes are localized to the outer leaflet of the membrane in the periplasmic compartment. This correlates well with a previous study that demonstrated that HtrA1 is an integral membrane protein of 55 kDa (30). However, the presence of HtrA2 and HtrA3 in the culture medium of cells grown in vitro suggests that these enzymes may be exported to the periplasm (31­33). HtrA2 is part of an operon consisting of mprA (RV0981)-mprB (RV0982)-htrA2(RV0983)-(unknown)RV0984. MprA-MprB is a two-component system required by Mtb for growth in vivo during the persistent stage of infection (34). Recent studies have also demonstrated that MprA regulates the expression of numerous stress responsive genes in Mtb, including sigB and sigE, while MprB acts as a cognate sensor kinase (35). Interestingly, it has been shown that MprA regulates its own expression, as well as the expression level of HtrA2, by binding to the 8 bp conserved motif found upstream of htrA2 and mprA (36). All three Mtb HtrA homologues exhibit moderate levels of sequence homology among themselves (32­40% identical) and levels of sequence identity similar to those of the E. coli periplasmic proteases DegP, DegS, and DegQ. DegP and DegQ have two PDZ domains, and DegS has a single PDZ domain. The four HtrA homologues identified in the human genome and the three HtrA enzymes of Mtb contain only one PDZ domain. However, the function of Mtb-HtrA and its specific role in Mtb have not yet been explored. Here in this study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of Mtb-HtrA2 and demonstrated that this enzyme is required for the virulence of Mtb in mice and that it behaves as both a protease and a chaperone. Our studies show that mHtrA2 undergoes autolytic processing and produces several peptide products; two of these peptides are identified in the PDZ and protease binding pockets of the mHtrA2 crystal structure. Binding of both the peptides to the mHtrA2 active site and PDZ domain suggests that autoproteolysis of this enzyme might be involved in modulating its activity. In addition, we have shown an unusual occurrence of hydrophobic residue clusters associated with the autolytic sites of Mtb-HtrA2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Deletion of the Mtb htrA2 Gene. Flanking DNA sequences of Mtb-htrA2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into vector pJSC284 upstream and downstream of the hygromycin resistance gene. The deletion allele was packaged into a temperature sensitive mycobacteriophage, phAE159, and then packaged into a  phage. E. coli HB101 was transduced with the  phage, and hygro-

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 23, 2008 6093 mycin resistant clones were chosen for cosmid isolation. Mycobacterium smegmatis was transformed with pooled cosmids, where high-titer phage lysates were obtained for transducing Mtb (37­39). Mouse Virulence Experiments. BALB/c SCID and C57BL/6 mice were infected intravenously with 1 × 106 CFU of mycobacteria. Four mice from each experimental group were sacrificed 24 h and 3, 8, and 15 weeks after infection. Organs were analyzed for bacterial burden and histology. A log rank test was used for analyzing the significance of mouse survival, and a statistical hypothesis test (Student's t-test) was used to analyze the colony's transformation of units in organs. Cloning and Purification. The truncated form of MtbHtrA2 (tm-HtrA2) containing residues 125­464 was amplified by PCR from MtbH37Rv genomic DNA. This expression construct contained 31 vector-derived amino acids fused at the N- and C-termini, including two His6 tags. The PCR product was subcloned into the pET28b vector at the NdeI and XhoI sites and transformed into BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The S317A mutant of tm-HtrA2 was prepared using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene). Both native and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli at 37 °C. The cells were grown at 37 °C and 200 rpm in LB (Luria broth) medium with kanamycin (final concentration of 50 µg/mL) until the OD600 reached 0.6­0.9. The culture was then induced with 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio- -D-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. For Se-Met protein, the pET28b-tmHtrA2 clone was transformed into E. coli B834(DE3) (Novagen) Met auxotrophic cells; the cells were grown in M9 minimal medium with all of the 19 standard amino acids, and methionine was substituted with selenomethionine (50 mg/L). A solution of kanamycin (50 µg/mL) was added to the culture, and the cells were grown at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 0.5. The culture was then induced at 25 °C with 1 mM IPTG. For all protein preparations, the cells were lysed using a French press, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 40 min. The 0.2 µm membrane-filtered clear supernatant was then loaded onto an Amersham Biosciences Hi-trap Ni2+ chelating column that was equilibrated with the cell resuspension buffer, and the protein was eluted using an imidazole gradient [20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl, and 200 mM imidazole]. All proteins were purified by a nickel affinity column, followed by size exclusion chromatography using Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia). The protein band for the expressed tm-HtrA2 appeared at 32 kDa instead of 37 kDa as observed via SDS-PAGE. Along with this 32 kDa protein band, another strongly expressed protein band of approximately 10 kDa was observed in the soluble fraction of the recombinant E. coli lysate. This 10 kDa protein (mHtrA2-PDZ hereafter) was copurified using a nickel column and separated using size exclusion chromatography. Attempts to crystallize this 10 kDa protein were unsuccessful. The fractions containing the 32 kDa product of tm-HtrA2 (mHtrA2 hereafter) were pooled, concentrated, and crystallized. Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystals of mHtrA2 were obtained at 16 °C from a solution of 7 mg/mL protein

A single crystal was mounted in a cryo-loop and was flashcooled to 100 K after a brief soak in N-paratone oil. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at synchrotron beamline BioCARS 14-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) and processed with HKL2000 using DENZO and SCALEPACK (40). Structure Determination. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing (41) was used with diffraction data collected from a Se-Met mHtrA2 crystal at three different wavelengths. Four (out of nine) Se sites were identified using SHELXD (42) and were refined by SHARP (43). Solvent flattening SOLOMON (44, 45) improved the electron density map to the point where an initial protein model could be constructed using Xtalview (46). The asymmetric unit contained three molecules (molecules A, B, and C). The electron density map corresponding to the protease domain (residues 149­364) of each molecule was mostly similar. The PDZ domain of molecule A (residues 376­464) is continuous and well-ordered. In contrast, the PDZ domains of molecules B and C exhibited an increased flexibility and contained a greater number of disordered residues. Disordered protein residues (see Table 1), which are not visible in the electron density map, were omitted from the model; 327 water molecules were identified by Xtalview (46) and were included in the refinement. A refined model was produced through several cycles of manual model building and maximum likelihood refinement in CCP4-Refmac5 (47). Clear, continuous, and unexplained electron density above the 1 cutoff in the experimental map was observed in both the protease and PDZ binding pocket of HtrA2 (Figure 1a, b). The additional densities were interpreted as extended polypeptides of VEQV and GATV. Several other equivalent tetrapeptide residues were examined and ruled out by close examination of the interactions of the peptide with the binding pocket. Further refinement after including these peptides yielded the final model with an Rfactor of 22.5% and an Rfree of 27.2%. The final model gave good stereochemistry (Table 1) as determined by the Ramachandaran plot [calculated with PROCHECK (48, 49)]. The crystal data and refinement statistics are given in Table 1, and the atomic coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entry 2Z9I. The figures were prepared using Spock (http:// quorum.tamu.edu), Raster3D (50), and Chimera (51). Protease Assay. The bovine -casein (Sigma) was used as a substrate. The assay buffer contained 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. For 2 h, 5­10 µg of mHtrA2 was incubated with 70 µg of -casein at 37 °C in a total reaction volume of 80 µL. The results were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the products were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (Figure 2a). Chaperone Assay. The chaperone-like activities of mHtrA2, the S317A mutant of tm-HtrA2, and the 10 kDa product of HtrA2 (mHtrA2-PDZ) were measured using pig heart citrate synthase (CS) as the substrate as described previously (52­54). CS (Sigma) was denatured in a solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride, and 40 mM DTT for 2 h at room temperature.

The denatured CS was diluted 200-fold into a refolding buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and enzyme to reach the required molar ratios (Figure 2b). The change in turbidity caused by the aggregated proteins was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 320 nm with a Cary 100 spectrophotometer at room temperature. MALDI-MS Analysis. Linear mode matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) data were acquired using a Voyager DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under optimized conditions. The HtrA2 sample was diluted 10fold in ddH2O and mixed 1:1 with MALDI matrix [15 mg/ mL sinapic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 50:50 acetonitrile (ACN)/ddH2O mixture with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)]. LC-MALDI-MS/MS Analysis. Crystals of mHtrA2 were resuspended in 300 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5. The protein solution was allowed to undergo autolytic digestion at 10 °C. The protein solution was diluted 10-fold in ddH2O and filtered through a 10 kDa MWCO filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove the intact protein. The resulting solution was then subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis by injecting

10 µL onto a C18 reverse-phase column (Vydac, 0.18 mm × 150 mm) using an LC Packings (Sunnyvale, CA) autosampler and pumps. The LC gradient from 2 to 60% solution B [85% ACN, 5% 2-propanol (IPA), 9.9% ddH2O, and 0.1% TFA] was used to elute the peptides from the column at a rate of 1.0 µL/min. The column effluent was mixed in a "T" junction (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) as described by Rosas-Acosta and co-workers (55) with a solution of R-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA, 7.5 mg/mL) (Sigma Aldrich) at a rate of 1.5 µL/min. CHCA was prepared in a 12:7:1 ACN/ddH2O/IPA solution with 10 mM ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and doped with 50 fmol/µL bradykinin fragment 2-9 and 150 fmol/µL adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18-39 used as internal mass calibrants. The resulting solution was directly spotted onto MALDI plates using a robotic spotter (ProBot, LC Packings). Similar configurations for LC and other separation modes have been reported using the ProBot for fraction collection (55, 56). The LC fractions were spotted every 6 s. Two MALDI plates were used per injection, each plate containing 624 spots. The resulting LC separations were interrogated using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) in both MALDI-MS and MS/MS acquisition modes. MALDIMS data for each LC fraction were obtained using the

reflectron detector in positive mode (700­4500 Da, 2100 Da focus mass) with internal mass calibration. Tandem MS data were acquired for each chromatographic peak using the following precursor selection: signal-to-noise threshold, 50; 12 precursors/fraction; 150 ppm fraction-to-fraction mass tolerance; chromatographic peak width, six fractions; and 3600 laser shots. Autolytic peptides were identified using both the MS-NonSpecific tool available on Protein Prospector (http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/4.0.8/mshome.htm) and the corresponding tandem MS data. N-Terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis. After SDSPAGE, the protein sample was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and visualized via Coomassie brilliant blue staining. The proteins were excised from the PVDF membrane and analyzed with a HewlettPackard G1005A Automated Protein Sequencer at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory (Texas A&M University). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION htrA2 Is Required for Mouse Virulence. To improve our understanding of the physiological function of HtrA homologues, deletion of the three genes (htrA1, htrA2, and htrA3) was achieved in Mtb using specialized transduction (39).

Successful deletions of both htrA2 and htrA3 were independently generated in Mtb, creating two mutant strains. In parallel experiments, the generation of the htrA1 mutant could not be obtained, suggesting that htrA1 may be essential. In addition, Sassetti et al. (57) have identified htrA1 as a gene that could not be disrupted in Mtb using the transposon site hybridization method. To analyze the roles that the two nonessential genes play in the virulence of Mtb, C57BL/6 mice were infected with these mutants. The htrA2 strain revealed a modest but

significant increased time-to-death phenotype compared to the wild type or the complemented mutant (297, 245, and 252 days, respectively; p < 0.01) (Figure 3a). This result was confirmed with a second experiment in which mice infected with the mutant strain had a longer mean survival time than mice infected with the wild-type strain (313 and 201 days, respectively; p < 0.01) (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). In contrast, the htrA3 deletion had no effect on the mean survival time of mice and no other detectable phenotype (data not shown). To further analyze

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 23, 2008 6097 performed. We have constructed and analyzed an HtrA2 variant lacking the N-terminal cytoplasmic region and its transmembrane segment. This truncated form of Mtb-HtrA2 (residues 125­464, designated tm-HtrA2) was expressed in E. coli and purified. While the predicted molecular mass of the recombinant protein was 37 kDa (corresponding to residues 125­464 of HtrA2 and 31 vector-derived amino acids, including N- and C-terminal His6 tags), analysis of the molecular mass based on SDS-PAGE of the protein expressed in E. coli showed that the soluble recombinant protein had a mass of approximately 32 kDa. N-Terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the start of this 32 kDa protein was Ala149-Asn150-Met151-Pro152-Pro153, indicating autocleavage between Ala148 and Ala149. The 32 kDa autoproteolytic product of tm-HtrA2 exists as a trimer in solution [from size exclusion chromatography (data not shown)] and was shown to possess proteolytic activity against -casein at 37 °C, generating at least two fragments (10 and 16 kDa) of casein (Figure 2a). The length of the degraded product from -casein indicates that it is an endoprotease as observed for other HtrA enzymes (7, 9, 10). To demonstrate that this was a serine protease, we generated the S317A mutant of tm-HtrA2, which exhibited neither autoproteolytic nor proteolytic activity when tested against -casein. In addition to the serine protease activity, the HtrA2 of Mtb also possesses chaperone activity similar to that of HtrA of Thermotoga maritima (52). The chaperone activity of recombinant mHtrA2 and that of the S317A mutant of tmHtrA2 were measured with a pig heart citrate synthase assay (52­54). The S317A mutant of tm-HtrA2 exhibited 37% inhibition of CS aggregation, while mHtrA2 exhibited 34% inhibition (Figure 2b). However, the percentage of inhibition is significantly low compared to that of an HtrA homologue from T. maritima, which exhibited more than 80% activity at the same molar ratio (52). A second strongly expressed protein band was observed during purification, with a molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa (named mHtrA2-PDZ in Experimental Procedures). This product eluted as a monomer via size exclusion chromatography. N-Terminal amino acid sequencing of this band yielded a sequence within the HtrA2 protein starting from Ser378, the result of an autoproteolytic cleavage between Ala377 and Ser378. The 10 kDa band was not present in the S317A mutant preparation. On the basis of the crystal structure reported in the latter part of this work, Ala377 is the start of the 10 kDa PDZ domain. The cleaved PDZ domain has not been observed in any other HtrA homologues, including E. coli's DegP and DegS. Furthermore, a construct with just two PDZ domains of E. coli DegP exhibited no chaperone activity (8). In contrast, the purified 10 kDa PDZ product of Mtb-HtrA2 exhibited chaperonelike activity similar to that of mHtrA2 (Figure 2b). The Crystal Structure of HtrA2 Indicates a Possible Autoregulatory Mechanism. To provide further insight into the molecular mechanism of HtrA2, the crystal structure of mHtrA2 was determined at 2.0 Å resolution (Table 1). mHtrA2 forms trimers in the crystal lattice, and the subunits are named molecules A, B, and C, as shown in Figure 2c. Each subunit is composed of an N-terminal protease domain

FIGURE 3: (a) Survival of C57BL/6 mice infected with wild-type Mtb (wt), mutant htrA2 (mc23135), and complemented (mc23136) strains. A significant difference in survival between the mutant strain and the complemented and wild-type strains is detected at p < 0.01. (b) Histopathology of lungs from mice infected with wild-type Mtb (M. tuberculosis Erdman strain) and htrA2 (mc23135). At various time points after infection (24 h and 3, 8, and 15 weeks), lungs were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Note that the number of lesions for each strain is comparable at the early time points but that the wild-type lesions have become confluent and occupy a larger proportion of the lung cross section at the later time points.

virulence, growth kinetics and pathology following mouse infections were examined. While no significant differences in CFU counts were observed 24 h or 3, 8, and 15 weeks after infection (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information), histopathological analyses did reveal differences consistent with the longer survival times of the htrA2 deletion. At week 8, the lungs from mice infected with the wild-type strain exhibited more extensive lesions than lungs of the htrA2 infected group containing a large number of foamy macrophages filled with Mtb (Figure 3b). In contrast, lungs from htrA2 mutant-infected mice exhibited smaller lesions with fewer foam cells and contained fewer visible bacilli. By week 15, the number of lung lesions and the extent of pathology increased for both groups. However, the lungs from mice infected with the wild type still demonstrated larger lesions, many of which were confluent compared to the lungs of mutant-infected mice. Granulomas were present in livers and spleens at all time points, and there were also more extensive lesions in the animals infected with the wild-type strain (Figure 3b). The decreased extent of pathology thus correlated with longer survival times. These results demonstrate that htrA2 is required for full virulence of Mtb in mice. The htrA2 Gene Encodes a Serine Protease with Chaperone ActiVity. To further define the functional role of HtrA2 in Mtb, biochemical and structural characterization was

(residues 149-364) and a C-terminal PDZ domain (residues 376-464). The three protease domains form the central core of the trimer, and the PDZ domains extend to the periphery. Similar to other serine proteases, the protease domain of each subunit has two perpendicular -barrel lobes ( 1- 6 and 7- 12) with a C-terminal helix (R3). Loops L1 ( 9- 10 connection), L2 ( 11- 12), L3 ( 8- 9), LA ( 1- 2), LB ( 3- 4), LC ( 4- 5), and LCA ( 5- 6) are defined according to the previously used nomenclature of serine proteases (Figure 2e). Interactions between the subunits of the trimer are formed exclusively by residues of the 7 and 8 strands of the serine protease domains. Although the PDZ domains make no significant interactions with their neighboring subunits, they are positioned close to the proteaseprotease interfaces of the trimer. The closest distance between the LC loop of the protease domain and the PDZ domain of the neighboring subunit is 4 Å. When this is taken into account, even a small change in the position of the PDZ domain would allow its 14- 15 loop to interact with loop LC of the neighboring protease domain and may even change the properties of the substrate binding pocket (Figure 2c). The mHtrA2 trimer is similar to the previously reported E. coli DegP, E. coli DegS, and human HtrA2/OMI trimers (5, 11, 16). However, only E. coli DepP forms a hexameric assembly, a dimer of two trimers. The contacts between the two trimers are primarily made by a long and flexible loop, termed LA. In E. coli, this loop is 55 residues long, and it has been shown to block the active sites of each subunit in the adjacent trimer (5). These results led the authors to suggest that DegP acts as chaperone at low temperatures when the loop is blocking the protease active site, and at elevated temperatures, its protease activity is turned on via a conformational change in the loop. Previous studies have also suggested a similar mechanism of regulation for the HtrA homologue from T. maritima which also contains the long LA loop (52). In contrast, the LA loop of mHtrA2 (residues 150­155) is only six residues in length, much too short to follow the proposed switch between distinct protease or chaperone activity (Figure 4). Therefore, mHtrA2 cannot switch between a distinct protease or chaperone oligomeric state by rearranging the protease domain loops. Furthermore, there is no evidence from the crystal lattice of any higher oligomeric state. In human HtrA2/OMI, the PDZ domain inhibits its proteolytic activity by packing directly onto its active site (16). In contrast, the Ser317-His197-Asp236 triad residues in each subunit of Mtb-HtrA2 are situated in the center of the protease domain and are freely accessible to solvent (Figure 2c). The imidazole nitrogen atom of His197 hydrogen bonds with the OH group of Ser317 (3.31 Å) of loop L1. N of His197 also forms a hydrogen bond interaction (2.85 Å) with the carboxylate of Asp263 of loop LCA to complete the catalytic triad. Loop L2 (residues 291-302) is typically involved in substrate binding, forming an S1 specificity pocket near Ser317. A flexible region of loop L2 (residues 293-299) is disordered in the electron density of all three subunits. The intrasubunit interactions are similar in all three subunits; molecule A is used for the distance calculations. In the serine protease trypsin, the NH group of Gly193 (position -2 from the active site Ser) and Ser195 [catalytic triad residue (position 0)] form the active tetrahedral oxya-

FIGURE 4: Comparison of mHtrA2's protease domain (yellow ribbon) with the protease domains of E. coli DegP (cyan ribbon; molecule A of PDB entry 1ky9). The catalytic triad of mHtrA2 is drawn as a stick model (active site Ser labeled). The protease domain structure is fairly conserved in both the proteins, while loop regions display significant differences. Loop LA of DegP (labeled LA-DegP) is 55 residues long and predicted to be responsible for a temperature switch. Loop LA of mHtrA2 (labeled LA-mHtrA2) is too short (residues 150­155) to follow this mechanism. Active site loops L2 and L3 of mHtrA2 are also labeled.

nion intermediate. In E. coli DegS, the C-O bond of the position -3 residue (position -3 from the active site Ser) points into the oxyanion hole and blocks the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate (18). The C-terminal tetrapeptide of the outer membrane porin binds to the PDZ domain of DegS and activates the protease domain. In the active form structure, the position -3 residue of the DegS-oxyanion hole switches its CdO group away from the NH groups to facilitate substrate binding (17). In contrast, Mtb-HtrA2 develops an active oxyanion hole formed by the Pro314Gly315-Asn316-Ser317 residues. The position -3 residue (Pro314) imposes a steric hindrance in the trans conformation and facilitates the formation of the active oxyanion hole (see Figure 2d). Interestingly, additional electron density was clearly visible in the active sites of all protease domains of the trimer (Figure 1a). This extra electron density, from an unbiased nonaveraged electron density map, was very clear and could be fitted and refined by a "VEQV" sequence (defined as P4Val-P3Glu-P2Gln-P1Val in Figure 1c). Although nearly identical electron density was observed in all three subunits of the trimer, molecule B shows additional electron density, which resembles a Ser on the N-terminal side of the peptide. We cannot rule out the possibility that other residues might extend into the solvent and may be disordered. The amino acid sequence of HtrA2 suggests that this additional electron density site belongs to a cleavage product of the recombinant protein of HtrA2 (residues V156-E157-Q158-V159). The unbiased electron density map also clearly indicates that P1Val of the peptide is covalently linked to O of the active site Ser317 (Figure 1a,c). The side chain O atom of the catalytic Ser317 forms a covalent bond with the carbonyl

M. tuberculosis HtrA2

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 23, 2008 6099 These results suggest that a peptide with four (or more) residues, observed at the active site of the protease domain of each subunit, is generated by an autoproteolytic cleavage, and each protease domain of mHtrA2 is an acyl-enzyme adduct of an oligopeptide. As the binding pocket is already occupied, it is obvious that the binding of the tetrapeptide should inhibit the protease activity. In contrast, mHtrA2 exhibited clear proteolytic activity against -casein (Figure

FIGURE 5: Summary of the LC-MALDI-MS/MS analysis of the autolytic cleavage sites of HtrA2. Arrows indicate the locations of the identified cleavage sites. We have cloned and overexpressed tm-HtrA2 (residues 125­472). Residues 125­148 (blue letters) were autocleaved during overexpression, yielding mature HtrA2 (mHtrA2). Apart from these, a 10 kDa PDZ domain was also observed during overexpression as a result of the autoproteolytic process. N-Terminal amino acid sequencing of mHtrA2 and the 10 kDa domain located two additional cleavage sites that are indicated by red arrows. Residues 149­364 form the protease domain of mHtrA2, and residues 376­464 form the PDZ domain. The H-D-S catalytic site residues are colored red. The tetrapeptides observed in the vicinity of the protease and PDZ binding pockets of the mHtrA2 crystal structure are highlighted in green.

carbon atom of P1Val (1.3 Å), and its backbone oxygen atom extends into the oxyanion hole to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Ser317 (3.1 Å) and Gly315 (2.8 Å). The backbone of the rest of the tetrapeptide is hydrogen bonded to the protein via P1Val N-Ser333 O (3.5 Å), P3Glu O-I335 N (3.0 Å), and P3Glu N-I335 O (3.4 Å) bonds. Side chain atoms of P1Val protrude into the P1 binding pocket formed by Ile335, Pro314, Ala334, Ile312, and Asn316. The binding of P1Val was augmented by both hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions of these residues. O of P2Gln forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp236 (3.1 Å) and His197 (3.1 Å) of the catalytic triad. The side chain of P3Glu forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen atom of Ser347 (2.8 Å) and the side chain oxygen atom of Thr337 (3.0 Å), and P4Val makes hydrophobic interactions with Val290.

2a) present in the assay buffer. To correctly address this issue further, we repeated the protease assay using the enzyme derived directly from the crystals of mHtrA2. Several crystals grown under the same condition were harvested, washed extensively with the crystallization buffer, and dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). In spite of the low yield obtained via this process, as observed in the SDS-PAGE gel, the enzyme displayed proteolytic activity, as shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. Thus, the enzyme-tetrapeptide adduct observed in the crystal is, in fact, a provisional intermediate. Tri-, penta-, and tetradecapeptides have been previously observed at the catalytic sites of the acyl-enzyme adduct crystal structures of R- and -chymotrypsin (58­60), the tetra-decamer having been shown to be a potential inhibitor (60). To determine the specificity of the HtrA2 protease, we monitored the autodigestion products of the dissolved crystals of mHtrA2 via LC-MALDI-MS as well as LC-ESI-MS. Linear mode MALDI-MS analysis resulted in observation of both the intact HtrA2 protein (32 kDa) and the 10 kDa PDZ fragment. Similar results were obtained from LC-ESIMS analysis; i.e., the 32 kDa intact protein predominates until the 10 kDa fragment appears after autodigestion for 27 h. In addition, several small autolytic peptide fragments were observed in the linear mode MALDI-MS and LC-ESIMS data. Therefore, LC-MALDI-MS was used to identity these autolytic products.

The side chain residues of this tetrapeptide make a network of nonbonding interactions involving R4, L3, LCA, the protease binding pocket, and the second autoproteolytic product A. Binding of A and B should modulate the activity of HtrA2. The left panel shows the relative positioning of PDZ- and protease-bound tetrapeptides. The right panel (stereoview) shows the detailed interactions between the PDZ binding pocket and protease active site. The protease domain is colored green and the PDZ domain yellow.

MohamedMohaideen et al. Val429, Leu428, and Leu379. Binding of the tetrapeptide is further stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions between Ala(-2) O and Val383 N (2.9 Å) and between Ala(-2) N and Val383 O at 3.0 Å. The backbone nitrogen of Gly(-3) forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond interaction with the side chain oxygen atom of Thr384. Interestingly, helix R4 makes a significant interaction with loop L3 of the protease domain. The side chain oxygen atom of Asp426 of R4 forms hydrogen bond interactions with the side chain oxygen atom of Ser291 of L3 (2.8 Å). Residues Val429 and Ala430 of R4 form hydrophobic interactions with Val302 of loop L3. One of the side chain nitrogens of Arg433 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen atom of Val302 (3.5 Å). Together, the PDZ-bound tetrapeptide makes a network of nonbonded interactions with protease domain loop L3 through R4 (Figure 6). Under stressful conditions, E. coli's outer membrane porin binds to the PDZ domain of DegS and activates the protease domain through "bound peptide-R4-L3-active site" interactions (17). Although Mtb-HtrA2 is active in its native form, the binding of the tetrapeptide to the PDZ domain should have an effect on the substrate specificity and might regulate the activity of its protease domain. While the physiological consequences of the observed autocleavage are unclear, these studies indicate that the MtbHtrA2 forms an active oxyanion hole and an active protease, which might regulate itself by its autoproteolytic products. Our studies suggest that the release of HtrA2 from the membrane is more likely to be achieved by an autoproteolytic mechanism, as there is no signal peptide cleavage sequence evident at the N-terminus of the protein. Also, we illustrated the dominance of Val-specific autolytic cleavage that might play a major role in the HtrA2-associated virulence of the pathogen. The role of richness of Val and other hydrophobic residue clusters at the cleavage sites of these proteases, such as Mtb-HtrA2, warrants further investigation.

Information show representative LC-MALDI-MS data for a single LC fraction containing a few autolytic peptides and the peptides used as internal mass calibrants. The identity of these autolytic peptides was confirmed from tandem MS analysis. For example, the tandem MS data for PPGSVEQV (m/z 812.42) shown in Figure S5B of the Supporting Information illustrate a nearly complete series of b-type fragment ions. The additional tandem MS data confirmed HtrA2 autolytic peptides observed from the LC-MALDIMS analysis are summarized in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. Figure 5 summarizes the results of LC-MALDI-MS/MS analysis. The analysis of the amino acid sequence at the autolytic cleavage sites clearly indicates the dominance of the Val residue with the highest propensity for autolytic attack; 18 of 40 potential cleavage sites identified by LC-MS analysis are at the carboxyl side of the Val residue. Similarly, the most important residues next to Val are Ala (six sites), Thr (five sites), Ile (five sites), Ser (four sites), and Leu (two sites). These results are consistent with the active sites of the mHtrA2 crystal structure. Interestingly, the PDZ pocket of the HtrA2 structure also displays marked complementarity to the Val residue, as described below. The structure of the PDZ domain of Mtb-HtrA2 is similar to that of other bacterial PDZ domains with seven -strands, two R-helices, and a carboxylate-binding loop formed by Ser378, Leu379, Gly380, and Val381. Surprisingly, significant electron density was also visible in the peptide-binding pocket of the PDZ domain formed by -strand 14, the N-terminal SLGV loop, and R-helix strand R4. The additional electron density was clear only in subunit A of the trimer and could be modeled and refined by an extended tetrapeptide with the GATV sequence, which matches Gly438, Ala439, Thr440, and Val441 of HtrA2 (Figure 1b). Each protomer of the mHtrA2 structure had continuous electron density for residues 156­159 (SVEQ) and 438­441 (GATV). The LC-MS analysis of the dissolved crystals shows no evidence of any short tetrapeptides. However, the analysis did confirm the presence of an 11-amino acid peptide that ended with GATV and a nine-amino acid peptide that ended with VEQV (see Figure 5 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information). These results and the analysis of the autolytic sites suggest that the tetrapeptides observed in the crystal structure should be longer. It is possible that the N-terminal ends of these peptides are disordered in the crystal structure and are not visible in the electron density map. The autoproteolytic product GATV binds to the PDZ domain of HtrA2 by forming an additional -sheet ( B) to 14 through the backbone interactions typical of an antiparallel -sheet. The C-terminus of B is anchored by the carboxylate-binding loop of the PDZ domain. A similar type of -augmentation was previously observed in other PDZ-peptide complexes, including DegS (11, 14, 17). In HtrA2, the carboxyl-terminal residue of the B tetrapeptide [Val(0) of G(-3)A(-2)T(-1)V(0)] forms a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone nitrogen atoms of peptide-binding pocket residues Leu379 (2.8 Å) and Gly380 (2.9 Å) (Figure 6). The carboxyl oxygen atoms of Val(0) also form a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen atom of Ala377 and the backbone and side chain oxygen atoms of Thr(-1). Val(0)'s side chain is buried into the hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Val432,
