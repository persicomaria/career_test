INTRODUCTION TTHA0303 (TT2238) is a 19-kDa neutral protein (number of amino acids 5 169, theoretical pI 5 6.99) from an extremely thermophilic Gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8, which is capable of growing at 858C. TTHA0303-like proteins are found only in several bacterial genera such as Thermus, Deinococcus, Geobacillus, and Bacillus. The crystal structure of YfiT (17% sequence identical to TTHA0303, PDB: 1RXQ)1 is the only structure reported so far for TTHA0303-like ° proteins. Here, we report the 2.0-A crystal structure of TTHA0303. TTHA0303 and YfiT commonly have a fourhelix bundle fold with an unusual down-up-up-down topology, and a characteristic histidine triad (HT) on the molecular surface. We have revealed some unique features of TTHA0303 (1) it has a cleavable loop between two parallel helices a2 and a3, (2) its HT does not coordinate any metal ion, even in the presence of 100 mM Zn21, (3) it is monomeric in solution, unlike homodimeric YfiT.

and the following six steps of column chromatographies: HiPrep 26/10 Desalting, Super Q Toyopearl 650M, Resource S, Hydroxyapatite CHT20, HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg, and HiPrep26/10 Desalting (GE Healthcare, Tosoh, and Bio-Rad). Crystallization was carried out by a microbatch method, where 0.5 lL of 13 mg/mL SeMetTTHA0303 solution and 0.5 lL of crystallization buffer consisting of 20% (w/v) PEG 1000, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 200 mM Zn acetate were mixed to form a drop in 15 lL of oil (paraffin:silicon 5 7:3, v/v) and kept at 188C. Rod-shaped crystals with approximate dimensions of 80 lm 3 30 lm 3 30 lm were obtained ° in a month. The crystal diffracted X-rays beyond 2.0-A resolution. Se-MAD data were obtained at SPring-8 ° (Harima, Japan) BL26B2 at wavelengths of 0.97914 A ° (edge), and 0.90000 A (remote). The ° (peak), 0.97950 A diffraction data were processed with HKL2000,2 the phase problem was solved, the initial model was built with SOLVE/RESOLVE,3,4 and the protein structure was refined with REFMAC5 and COOT6 and verified with

MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was carried out with an AXIMA CFRplus mass spectrometer (Shimadzu).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION TTHA0303 protein was crystallized in the space group P41212 with two protein molecules in an asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of TTHA0303 (169 amino acid residues) was solved by the Se-MAD method at 2.0° A resolution and was refined to Rwork and Rfree factors of 20.4% and 25.3%, respectively. Diffraction data and refinement statistics are given in Table I. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit adopt almost identical con-

° formations, with an atomic RMS difference of 0.3 A for a 120 aligned C atoms. TTHA0303 protein has a four-helix bundle structure with a topology of a1 (10­30) ;- a2 (47­72) :- a3 (106­126) :- a4 (145­165) ; (Fig. 1). The protein structure does not include the N- and C-termini (1­8 and 167/168­169) and a $30-residue loop between the two parallel helices a2 and a3 (73/74­103) because of very weak or unobserved electron densities (the residue numbers appearing in this article are those of TTHA0303, as shown in Fig. 3). The DALI8 structural database search showed that the most structurally similar protein to TTHA0303 is YfiT from Bacillus subtilis (PDB code, 1RXQ).1 These proteins share 25% sequence iden° tity and a 2.2-A RMS difference for 123 aligned Ca atoms. They commonly have a histidine triad (HT) formed by conserved His53, His155, and His159 on the molecular surface (Fig. 2). But these molecules have different features as well. The HT of YfiT coordinates a Ni21 ion together with three H2O molecules, but the HT

of TTHA0303 coordinates no metal ion, even in the presence of 100 mM Zn21 in the crystallization drop. Since the geometry of the HT, metal ion, and Glu81 in YfiT is similar to that of active-site residues in some zinc pro-

teases such as thermolysin, a possible hydrolase activity of YfiT has been proposed.1 In contrast, TTHA0303, which has Pro81 instead of Glu, cannot form a YfiT-like putative active site of metalloprotease. Furthermore,

The residue numbers are those of the TTHA0303 protein. The secondary structure elements of TTHA0303 and YfiT are shown above the TTHA0303 sequence and below the YfiT sequence, respectively. @@@@ and ? represent an a helix and a b strand, respectively. Ã shows a His residue involved in the histidine triad (HT). #### indicates the proteolytically removed region, as revealed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Gray characters indicate the regions not modeled because of very weak or unobserved electron densities.

TTHA0303 was found to be monomeric in solution, as revealed by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), in contrast to YfiT, which exists as a homodimer in solution.1 BLAST9 sequence database search showed that TTHA0303-like proteins with conserved His53, His155, and His159 are found only in several bacterial genera such as Thermus, Deinococcus, Geobacillus, and Bacillus. Genome databases show that T. thermophilus has no other TTHA0303-like protein,10,11 while B. subtilis has two TTHA0303-like proteins, YfiT and YuaE, both of which show 17% sequence identity to TTHA0303.12 Sequence alignment shows that YuaE is more similar to TTHA0303 than to YfiT (Fig. 3). In fact, YuaE has Pro81 (as in TTHA0303) instead of Glu81 (as in YfiT). The loop between a2 and a3 of TTHA0303/YuaE is longer than the corresponding loop of YfiT by 11­12 residues. The SeMet-TTHA0303 protein we used for crystallization migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE just after

the purification, but the protein was cleaved at several positions in the loop between a2 and a3 after storage at 48C for several months (see Fig. 3). The resulting TTHA0303 protein lacked the long loop between a2 and a3, as revealed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. This observation is consistent with no electron densities for the loop between a2 and a3 being observed and there being no space to accommodate the missing loop in the crystal due to the crystal packing. Therefore, the loop between a2 and a3 must also have been removed in the crystallization process of TTHA0303 at 188C. In contrast, the short loop between a2 and a3 in YfiT was not cleaved.1 Since the TTHA0303 samples were purified by a heat treatment (708C, 10 min) followed by six steps of column chromatographies, the removal of the loop occurred probably by potential proteolytic activity of TTHA0303, not by contaminated E. coli proteases. The possible metalloprotease activity of TTHA0303, particularly its selfprocessing activity to remove the long loop between a2 and a3, is being investigated. Very recently, the crystal structure of mycothioldependent maleylpyruvate isomerase (MDMPI) from the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum (PDB code, 2NSF) has been reported.13 MDMPI consists of an N-terminal metal-binding domain and a C-terminal domain with a novel folding pattern. The core of the N-terminal metal-binding domain consists of five a-helices, and is very similar to TTHA0303 and YfiT with ° atomic RMS differences of 2.2 A for 123 Ca atoms and ° and 146 Ca atoms, respectively, although the metal 2.8 A ligands in MDMPI are His, Glu, and His instead of an HT. Its putative active pocket includes the metal ion (Zn21), the metal binding residues, and other conserved residues located between the two domains, and both the N- and C-terminal domains are necessary for its enzyme activity. In a similar manner, TTHA0303 and YfiT may represent one part of heterodimeric enzymes whose partners have yet to be identified. The atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors of TTHA0303 have been deposited to PDB under the code 2YQY.
