Abstract The coupling of succinate oxidation to the reduction of ubiquinone by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) constitutes a pivotal reaction in the aerobic generation of energy. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SDH is a tetramer composed of a catalytic dimer comprising a flavoprotein subunit, Sdh1p and an iron­sulfur protein, Sdh2p and a heme b-containing membrane-anchoring dimer comprising the Sdh3p and Sdh4p subunits. In order to investigate the role of heme in SDH catalysis, we constructed an S. cerevisiae strain expressing a mutant enzyme lacking the two heme axial ligands, Sdh3p His-106 and Sdh4p Cys-78. The mutant enzyme was characterized for growth on a non-fermentable carbon source, for enzyme assembly, for succinate-dependent quinone reduction and for its heme b content. Replacement of both Sdh3p His-106 and Sdh4p Cys-78 with alanine residues leads to an undetectable level of cytochrome b562. Although enzyme assembly is slightly impaired, the apocytochrome SDH retains a significant ability to reduce quinone. The enzyme has a reduced affinity for quinone and its catalytic efficiency is reduced by an order of magnitude. To better understand the effects of the mutations, we employed atomistic molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the enzyme's structure and stability in the absence of heme. Our results strongly suggest that heme is not required for electron transport from succinate to quinone nor is it necessary for assembly of the S. cerevisiae SDH. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), also known as complex II or succinate:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), is a member of both the Krebs cycle (a central pathway of intermediary metabolism) and the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC), which is the major source of energy in aerobic biological systems. SDH catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and channels reducing equivalents to the MRC via ubiquinone [1­6]. In addition to its role in energy generation, SDH functions as a tumor suppressor

[7] and may be involved in regulating mitochondrial redox status by serving as an oxygen sensor [8­10]. Mutations of the human SDH are associated with a wide variety of clinical manifestations, including tumorigenesis, encephalopathy, optic atrophy and myopathy [11­13]. Understanding the structure and function of the mitochondrial SDHs is of fundamental importance in developing treatment for these diseases. SDHs are functionally and structurally related to membrane-bound fumarate reductases (FRDs), which are found in anaerobic organisms respiring with fumarate as terminal electron acceptor [2,14­16]. FRD catalyzes the reduction of fumarate to succinate, the reverse of the SDH reaction. Crystal structures of SDH enzymes from avian [17], bacterial [18­20], and mammalian [21] sources are available. In addition, a homology model of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDH has been published [22]. These structures have tremendously increased our understanding of the structure of the enzymes. SDH is an integral membrane protein localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane

of eukaryotes and cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes. SDH and FRD consist of two distinct domains: a hydrophilic catalytic dimer that protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix or the bacterial cytoplasm and either one or two integral membrane subunits. The catalytic subunits exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation across species and as expected, adopt very similar structures. The larger subunit carries a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), while the smaller subunit contains three iron­sulfur clusters. The membrane domains, in contrast, exhibit considerable variability in their primary structures and in cofactor composition and are believed to contribute to the distinct properties of the enzymes in different biological systems. In the S. cerevisiae SDH [22], the membrane domain comprises two small hydrophobic polypeptides, Sdh3p and Shd4p, proximal and distal quinone-binding sites, QP and QD, respectively and a b-type heme, reminiscent of the porcine enzyme [21]. Despite the abundance of structural information, important questions remain unanswered. Mechanistic details of catalysis, especially those occurring at the membrane domain remain poorly understood. Electron transfer is thought to proceed from succinate through FAD and the three iron­sulfur clusters to the proximal quinone, QP (Fig. 1). The near linear arrangement of these cofactors and their edge-to-edge distances, which are consistent with physiological electron transport via quantum tunneling [23], are highly suggestive of this pathway [17,19­ 22,24]. However the role of heme, which is present in all eukaryotic SDHs studied to date, and of the QD site [21,22,24] remain controversial. Heme b can function as an electron carrier but it does not appear to do so in all cases. Bovine SDH cytochrome b560 is not reducible by succinate [25] but the heme in the Escherichia coli SDH (E = + 36 mV) is [26]. In the m Bacillus subtilis SDH, a di-heme enzyme, the high potential heme (E = + 65 mV) is reducible by succinate, while the low m potential heme (E = - 95 mV) is not [27]. Evidence that the dim heme containing FRD and SDH enzymes are involved in transmembrane electron transfer has recently been published [28,29]. In the E. coli SDH, there are indications that the heme may provide an alternative low energy electron transfer pathway between the [3Fe­4S] cluster and quinone [30]. However, the E. coli FRD, which lacks heme, catalyzes with similar efficiency the same reactions as the E. coli SDH [31,32]; this observation seems to rule out an obligatory role for heme in catalysis. Another possible role for heme b is in the maintenance of the structural integrity of the membrane polypeptides. While such a role has been demonstrated for the di-heme Wolinella succinogenes FRD and B. subtilis SDH [33,34], the situation is less clear for the E. coli SDH. A study employing a hemedeficient mutant suggested that heme is required for enzyme assembly [35]. When the heme axial ligands (SdhC His-84 and SdhD His-71) were singly mutated, the enzymes retained succinate­quinone reductase activity despite an apparent absence of heme [36]. The same mutants were re-investigated and found to retain heme, although with altered redox potentials and spectroscopic properties [37]. The mutant enzymes were also found to be less thermostable and more sensitive to aeration, which may account for the discrepancies between the two reports.

In previous studies, we identified Sdh3p His-106 and Sdh4p Cys-78 as the heme axial ligands [38]. Mutation of either of these ligands produces an enzyme that retains a significant content of heme but with altered spectral properties. In this study, we constructed a heme-free S. cerevisiae SDH by simultaneously removing both axial ligands. The heme-free SDH is capable of efficient assembly, of supporting growth on a non-fermentable carbon source and of succinate-dependent quinone reduction. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further support our conclusion that heme b does confer some structural stability to the enzyme but it is not an obligatory requirement for electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone.
2. Materials and methods 2.1. Strains, media and culture conditions
The S. cerevisiae strain, YPH499 (MAT, ura3-52, lys2-801amber, ade2101ochre, his3200, leu21, trp163, +) was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The SDH3-SDH4 double knockout strain, sdh3W1/4K6

K.S. Oyedotun et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1767 (2007) 1436­1445 The starting membrane model contained 64 pre-equilibrated DPPC [47]; it was modified to 271 DPPC and 23,553 SPC water to accommodate the protein in a cubic box (10.52 nm a side). Before insertion of the protein, the modified bilayer was energy minimized for 300 ps and equilibrated for 2 ns. Thereafter, the inserted protein was position-restrained for 500 ps to allow the lipid to equilibrate around the protein. This was followed by an additional 500 ps equilibration of the whole system. Simulations were run with a time step of 2 fs with anisotropic pressure coupling on the z axis (membrane normal) for equilibration and isotropic pressure coupling for production runs. Other details of simulation conditions have been described [22]. Free energy calculations were carried out using the thermodynamic cycles in Fig. 2. The following thermodynamic integration equation was employed: Z DG ¼

(YPH499, sdh3::TRP1, sdh4::LYS2) has been described1. Briefly, the SDH3 gene was disrupted by replacing a 0.13-kb KpnI fragment of the gene with a 0.83-kb KpnI fragment containing the TRP1 gene in the yeast strain sdh4K6, which lacks chromosomal copy of SDH4 gene. The double knockout was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and complementation analysis on non-fermentable carbon source. The E. coli strain DH5 was used for all genetic manipulations. The yeast media (YPD, YPG, SG, YPGal, and semisynthetic galactose media) and culture conditions have been reported [38]. Plasmid loss was routinely monitored by plating out aliquots of cultures grown under non-selective conditions onto YPD and selective SD medium [39].

2.2. Construction of mutants
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR as described [40,41] using two complementary mutagenic primers and two flanking primers [38]. Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing the entire gene. 2.2.1. Isolation of mitochondria and submitochondrial membranes Stationary phase cultures grown on YPGal were harvested by centrifugation, lysed in a French pressure cell, and submitochondrial particles prepared by differential centrifugation as described [42]. For the preparation of mitochondria, cultures were grown in semisynthetic galactose to late logarithmic phase (OD600 3) and lysed enzymatically [42].

2.3. Enzyme assays and kinetic analysis
The succinate-dependent reduction of quinone was monitored spectrophotometrically at 22 °C as the malonate-sensitive, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4benzoquinone (DB)-mediated reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP). The succinate-dependent, phenazine methosulfate (PMS)-mediated reduction of DCPIP is a measure of membrane-associated Sdh1p/Sdh2p dimer. Other enzyme assays (succinate-cytochrome c reductase, succinate oxidase, NADH oxidase, glycerol-1-phosphate cytochrome c reductase) have been described [38]. The effect of quinone concentration on the initial velocity of the succinate-DB reductase activity was measured by varying the concentrations of DB at fixed saturating concentrations of succinate and DCPIP [39]. Apparent Km and Vmax values were calculated from a nonlinear regression fit to the Michaelis­ Menten equation using initial estimates from the Lineweaver­Burk plots [39]. 2.3.1. Spectroscopic analysis Optical difference spectra of detergent-solubilized mitochondrial membranes were determined as reported [43] using a Shimadzu dual wavelength ultravioletvisible spectrophotometer (Model 1601PC) with a spectral resolution of 0.5 nm and quartz cuvettes of 1.0 cm optical path length. Cytochrome contents were estimated spectrally (max, 562 nm; extinction coefficient, 24 mM- 1 cm- 1).

where H() is an intermediate Hamiltonian and  is a coupling constant between the wild-type ( = 0) and mutant ( = 1). The angled bracket b N denotes isothermal­isobaric ensemble average for the system characterized by the Hamiltonian H(). The coupling parameter  was changed in 20 successive stages. At each , a 250-ps equilibration was performed followed by 250 ps production simulation. In total, 20 ns free energy calculations were performed both in the forward and reverse directions for each of the two non-physical legs (G3 or G4) of the thermodynamic cycle (Fig. 2). The average value of the derivatives H()/ was calculated at each  point and the resulting free energy profile was then integrated using the trapezoid method [48] to obtain G01. Error was calculated for each bH()/N using block averaging methods [49,50] and an estimate of the error for G was obtained by integrating over the errors at individual  values.

2.4. Miscellaneous methods
Measurements of covalently bound FAD and protein contents, E. coli and yeast transformations and recombinant DNA methods have been described [38].

2.5. Computational methods
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GROMACS 3.3 package [44,45] with the GROMOS96 force field under constant pressure and temperature, and with a constant particle number (NpT ensemble). The temperature was set at 325 K using the Berendsen thermostat, while anisotropic pressure was maintained at 1 ba using the Parrinello­Rahman barostat. SDH was inserted into a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer solvated with single point charge (SPC) water [46]. All simulations use a model of the S. cerevisiae SDH (PDB entry code 1PB4) as the starting structure [22]. Sdh1p was removed from the structure in order to reduce computational complexity.

K.S. Oyedotun et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1767 (2007) 1436­1445 To calculate free energy differences between the reference (wild type) and mutant states, two amino acid residues (Sdh3p His106 and Sdh4p Cys78) were alchemically transformed into alanine residues either in the context of the holoenzyme or of the heme-free complex. The alchemical transformations use the single topology approach, in which every atom in the initial state has a counterpart in the final state. To accomplish this, dummy (virtual) atoms were introduced for atoms that exist in one state and have no counterpart in the other state. In our calculations, dummy atoms were identical to real atoms except that they have no nonbonded (Coulombic or van der Waals) interactions. Covalent terms associated with these dummy atoms were not changed during the course of the mutation. The non-bonded interactions between the initial and final states were interpolated using a soft-core potential [51]. As a starting structure for the reverse simulation, the final structure of the forward simulation after additional 250 ps of equilibration was used. The convergence of G was examined by hysteresis (from the stimulation of the reverse direction) and longer stimulation (500 ps for each  state). To explore the effect of the mutations on the structure of QP site, extended simulations of native and mutant enzymes were performed for 5 ns. Simulations were performed using 8 computer nodes of the University of Alberta Linux cluster (44 nodes of 3.8 GHz Pentium 4).

3. Results Sdh3p His-106 and Sdh4p Cys-78 were mutated to alanine residues in order to remove the two axial ligands to heme b. The resulting mutant genes were cloned into the yeast shuttle vectors, YCplac111 and pRS416 and transformed into the double knockout strain sdh3W1/4K6 to create sdh3H106A/ sdh4C78A-1 and sdh3H106A/sdh4C78A-2, two independent isolates. The respiratory proficiencies of mutant and wild type strains were determined on a minimal glycerol medium. The mutant strains were able to support respiratory growth comparable to the wild type parent strain YPH499 or to the double knockout strain containing plasmid-borne wild type SDH3 and SDH4 genes, pSDH3/pSDH4 (not shown). No detectable growth was observed for the double-knockout strain transformed with the empty vectors, sdh3W1/4K6 +vecs. To quantify respiratory growth, the growth yields on semisynthetic medium containing 0.1­0.5% galactose as carbon source were measured. We have shown that S. cerevisiae exhibits a diauxic shift when cultured in this medium; an initial fermentative growth is followed by a respiratory phase when the fermentable carbon source is limiting [39]. Table 1 shows percent growth yields (relative to wild type values) measured as optical densities at 600 nm of late stationary phase cultures on semisynthetic medium + 0.5% galactose. The wild type strain YPH499 and the knockout strain containing plasmid-borne wild type SDH3 and SDH4 genes, pSDH3/pSDH4 achieved similar

growth yields on this medium. sdh3H106A/sdh4C78A-1 and sdh3H106A/sdh4C78A-2 mutant strains showed slightly reduced growth yields of 70 ± 3% and 66 ± 5%, respectively. The double knockout strain, sdh3W1/4K6 +vecs achieved by fermentation alone a growth yield of 12 ± 2%. The spectrum of heme b associated with the S. cerevisiae complex II is not readily observable in the classical difference absorption spectrum of yeast mitochondria because it is obscured by the more abundant cytochrome b of complex III [43]. The S. cerevisiae SDH, like its mammalian counterpart, can be selectively oxidized by excess fumarate after all the mitochondrial chromophores have been reduced by dithionite [52]. We determined the effect of the mutations on cytochrome b562 assembly by monitoring the fumarate-oxidizable spectra in dithionite-reduced detergent-solubilized mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 3). In the wild type, the major peak centered at 562 nm appears within 1 min after the addition of fumarate. The spectrum is abolished in the presence of 40 mM malonate, a potent inhibitor of SDH that competes with fumarate at the active site. We could not detect a fumarate-oxidizable cytochrome in the mutant strains or in sdh3W1/4K6 +vecs. This indicates that SDH-associated cytochrome b562 is not present in mitochondrial membranes of these strains. We investigated the assembly of the mutant enzyme by measuring the levels of covalent FAD in mitochondrial membranes and by determining membrane-associated succinate-dependent PMS reductase activity. SDH is the major flavoprotein in S. cerevisiae and the acid-precipitable flavin levels of mitochondrial membranes quantitatively reflect SDH assembly [39]. Similarly, membrane-associated succinatedependent PMS reductase activities quantitatively reflect complex assembly, since this activity depends on the membrane

anchoring but not the catalytic functions of the hydrophobic subunits. The results are shown in Table 2. The covalent flavin levels of the sdh3H106A/sdh4C78A-1 and the sdh3H106A/ sdh4C78A-2 membranes were slightly reduced, suggesting a mild impairment in complex assembly or stability. Membranes from YPH499 and from pSDH3/pSDH4 exhibited similar covalent FAD contents. Also presented in Table 2 are the succinate-dependent, malonate-sensitive PMS reductase activities. Due to variable FAD contents of mutant and wild type strains, we determined turnover numbers based on FAD contents in order to compare their catalytic efficiencies. The data show that after normalization to FAD content, succinate-PMS reductase activity of the double mutant enzyme is reduced to 2400 ± 200 min- 1 in sdh3H106A/sdh4C78A-1 and to 2500 ± 100 min - 1 in sdh3H106A/sdh4C78A-2. This compares to values of 3800 ± 200 min- 1 for YPH499 and 3700 ± 100 min- 1 for pSDH3/ pSDH4. These observations suggest a mild impairment of complex catalytic activity or somewhat reduced stability for the apocytochrome complex. A residual flavin level of 15 ± 3 pmol FAD mg of protein- 1 was detected in the double knockout strain (sdh3W1/4K6 +vecs), representing 37% of wild type level. Similarly, significant background PMS-reductase activity was found in this strain. We suspect that this may be attributable to the expression of the Sdh3p and Sdh4p paralogs found in the

S. cerevisiae genome [6] and/or to contaminants from soluble flavoproteins [53]. The amount of residual activity is straindependent [38,54], but it is insufficient to support growth on a defined medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source. The next question that we posed was whether electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone can proceed in the absence of cytochrome b562. We assayed mitochondrial membranes of wild type and mutant S. cerevisiae strains for malonate-sensitive, succinate-dependent reduction of the exogenous quinone, DB (Table 3). The succinate-DB reductase activities of both mutant strains were reduced to about 70% of wild type activities, indicating that the mutations mildly affect the interaction of the enzyme with quinone. In addition, we measured the malonate-sensitive, succinatedependent cytochrome c reductase and the succinate-oxidase activities. These assays are physiologically relevant since they rely on the reduction of endogenous quinone. The former assay depends on complexes II and III of the respiratory chain; the latter assay requires complexes II, III and IV. The activities of mutant and wild type enzymes parallel the succinate-DB reductase activities (Table 3), suggesting that the loss of heme has only minor effects on catalysis. Interestingly, sdh3W1/4K6 +vecs shows very little activity in these physiological assays compared to the succinate-DB reductase (Table 3) and the succinate-PMS reductase assays (Table 2). To rule out the possibility that the SDH3 and the SDH4 mutations have pleiotropic effects on nearby complexes, we measured the NADH oxidase and the glycerol-1-phosphate cytochrome c reductase activities (Table 3). None of the mutations affected these activities, demonstrating the integrity of other respiratory chain complexes. The data in Table 3 suggest that the Sdh3p His106A and Sdh4p Cys78A mutations have measurable but small effects on electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone. It is unclear whether this effect is due to the absence of heme b or to structural perturbation in the vicinity of the QP site. As a first step in clarifying this, we determined the apparent kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, using the reporter DCPIP in a coupled enzyme assay that measures the malonate-sensitive, succinate-dependent reduction of the soluble quinone, DB DB (Table 4). There was a 2-fold increase in the apparent Km value of the hemeless mutant enzyme. To compare the catalytic efficiencies of the enzymes, we calculated the maximal turnover

The kcat values for the sdh3H106A/sdh4C78A-1 and sdh3H106A/ sdh4C78A-2 mutant enzymes were decreased to 2700 ± 200 m- 1 and 2600 ± 100 m- 1, respectively, compared to wild type values of 3800 ± 200 m- 1 (pSDH3/pSDH4) and 3900 ± 200 m- 1 (YPH499). The Michaelis­Menten equation may be rewritten as  = kcat/ Km × [E][S]. The ratio, kcat/Km (the rate constant for the reaction of free enzyme E with free substrate S) is an indicator of enzyme catalytic efficiency. The catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzyme decreased by  3-fold compared to the wild type enzymes (Table 4). We conclude that the Sdh3p His106A and the Sdh4p Cys78A mutations do affect the interaction of SDH with a quinone substrate. The use of molecular dynamics simulation as a complementary tool to experiments examining protein stability and protein­ligand interaction is well established [48,55,56]. In many cases, simulation results in good agreement with experiments have been obtained. We have presented data in this report that demonstrate that functional S. cerevisiae SDH is assembled in the absence of heme b (Tables 2 Tables 3 Tables 4). Our data also indicate that the apocytochrome enzyme does not function optimally (most quinone-mediated enzymatic activities are about 70% of wild type values, Table 3). The kinetic data (Table 4) suggest that the mutant enzyme does not interact as efficiently with its quinone substrate as does the wild type

enzyme. We reasoned that the heme axial ligand mutations and/ or the absence of heme b may either affect the stability of the enzyme or perturb the QP site and limit interaction with quinone. To explore these possibilities, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations. Two approaches were used to determine protein stability. First, we calculated the relative free energy of solvation of wild type and mutant enzymes when moved from vacuum to the membrane bilayer. This determines their stability in the membrane milieu, since solvation effects are important in determining thermodynamic helix propensities [57­59] and stability of mutants [48]. Second, we calculated the relative free energy of mutant and wild type enzymes in the presence and absence of heme b. The results of these calculations are summarized in Table 5. The Sdh3p His106A and Sdh4p Cys78A mutations destabilize the enzyme in the membrane milieu by 5.3 ± 0.2 kcal mol- 1. Similarly, the absence of heme in SDH destabilizes the enzyme by 7.8 ± 0.2 kcal mol- 1. The results also show that solvation accounts for the major destabilizing effect in the absence of heme b (up to 5.3 kcal mol- 1). The free energy gap by which the native state of proteins is typically stabilized relative to the unfolded or denatured state is in the order of 15­ 25 kcal mol- 1 [60­62]. Thus, SDH is only mildly destabilized in the absence of heme. This result seems to rule out any essential role for heme b in SDH assembly in S. cerevisiae.

Since the mutant enzyme retains a cavity of sufficient size to accommodate heme, we explored the possibility that alternative residues in the vicinity of heme b may serve as substitute ligands. Such residues include Sdh3p His46 and Sdh3p His113. There are no candidate residues in Sdh4p. Attempts to insert the heme by defining bonds between the candidate residues and the heme iron were unsuccessful (data not shown). The simulation explodes due to instability as the heme exits the pocket, confirming that heme retention in the pocket is not feasible in the absence of both axial ligands. Destabilizing effects caused by the mutations may explain why the mutant enzyme does not function optimally. We addressed this question further by investigating the effects of the mutations on the structure of the QP site and the heme binding region through unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation. Wild type and mutant SDH were simulated for 5 ns and their structures at the end of the simulation were compared. Fig. 4 shows the stability of the simulation system as monitored by total energy (Fig. 4A) and root mean square displacement of C (Fig. 4B). The total energy of the system is stable after about 1 ns of simulation. As shown in Fig. 4B (ii), the wild type structure is very close to the starting model. However, the mutant structure, 4B (i) moves slightly away ( 0.06 nm) from the starting model. Fig. 5 depicts the superposition of average structures of the last 500 ps trajectory of mutant (green) and wild type (white) SDH. The main deviation from the wild type structure (1.5 Å involving 2176 atoms) is in the vicinity of heme-binding pocket, highlighted in the box. Amino acid

residues in the vicinity of heme b pocket are shown in Fig. 6. The heme pocket in the mutant (Fig. 6B) shrinks inward about 1.8 Å compared to wild type heme environment (Fig. 6A). Although the pocket can still accommodate heme b in the mutant, there are no amino acid residues in the vicinity that can serve as axial ligands for heme b. The heme is shown in Fig. 6B only to emphasize that the heme pocket remains intact even after extensive MD simulation. There was no observable effect at the QP site (data not shown). 4. Discussion We have provided data in this report that demonstrates assembly of the yeast SDH in the absence of the two axial ligands for heme b. First, when the two heme axial ligands are replaced by alanine residues, no cytochrome b562 spectrum is detectable in mitochondrial membranes of the mutant strain. Second, the double mutant enzyme supports aerobic respiratory growth and can catalyze succinate-dependent quinone reduction. Third, molecular dynamics simulations show that the hemeless enzyme is thermodynamically stable. The S. cerevisiae SDH is unusual in its use of a Cys residue as one of the heme axial ligands [38]. All SQRs characterized to date use two His residues for heme coordination [4,17,19­21]. In a previous report [38], we showed that when either Sdh3p His106 or Sdh4p Cys78 is replaced by an alanine, SDH retains a significant amount of heme b, although with altered spectral properties. Thus, either Sdh3p His106 or Sdh4p Cys78 can

Fig. 6. Residues in the vicinity of heme b. The wild type (A) and mutant (B) energy-minimized average structures were calculated from the trajectory of the last 500 ps of a 5-ns simulation. The coordinates of heme b in the mutant structure were calculated by superposition of the wild type structure. The heme is included in panel B to indicate that after extended MD simulation, the heme pocket remains intact.

provide sufficient coordination for the stable insertion of heme b. The current report confirms and extends these studies. The combination of the two mutations prevents heme b coordination and there are no other potential ligands in the vicinity of heme b (Fig. 6B). There is the formal possibility that the heme ligand mutations lead to the loss of heme under the conditions used for the determination of heme content, which involve the use of detergent. We consider this possibility unlikely because detergent-solubilized membranes still contain assembled enzyme with a considerable turnover number [38]. The role of heme b in SQR is enigmatic. Three possible roles for heme b have been proposed. These include electron transfer, complex assembly and as an electron sink to protect against free radical damage. The data presented in this report demonstrate that electron transfer from succinate to quinone can proceed in the absence of heme b; heme b is not essential for catalysis in the yeast SDH. It is intriguing that the E. coli FRD, which lacks heme, catalyzes with similar efficiency the same reactions as the E. coli SDH [31,32], ruling out an obligatory role for heme in catalysis. Studies with the di-heme W. succinogenes FRD and B. subtilis SDH [33,34] have shown that the enzyme does not assemble in the absence of heme. In contrast, our data show that

functional SDH is assembled in the absence of heme b, although we observed measurable decreases in the amount of assembled enzyme as monitored by acid precipitable flavin content or by succinate-PMS reductase activities. We hypothesize that this may be due to a decreased stability of the mutant enzyme, rather than an essential role for heme in SDH assembly. The hypothesis was confirmed by results of atomistic molecular dynamic simulation. The absence of heme b destabilizes the enzyme by 7.7 ± 0.2 kcal mol- 1. The free energy of solvating wild type SDH in the bilayer is increased by 5.3 ± 0.2 kcal mol- 1 when the Sdh3p His106A and Sdh4p Cys78A mutations are introduced. This suggests that the major part of the destabilizing effect can be accounted for by solvation effects, possibly as lipid moves into the cavity that is present when heme is absent. Unrestrained extended molecular dynamics simulation shows that the destabilization is local (Fig. 5) and does not lead to a complete unfolding of the enzyme. The structural perturbation introduced by the absence of heme appears to be propagated to the QP site; our kinetic analysis indicates an altered affinity of the enzyme for quinone. What is the role of heme b in SQRs? In light of this study, roles in assembly or catalysis can be ruled out, at least for the

yeast enzyme. The suggestion that heme b may protect against oxidative damage by serving as electron sink [20] is appealing and should be further investigated. The E. coli FRD, which is devoid of heme, is known to produce copious amounts of reactive oxygen species [63], more than the E. coli SDH, which contains heme b. Heme b is well positioned (Fig. 1) to serve as a capacitor/voltage regulator during time of high electron flux. In a recent study using pulse radiolysis [30], it was shown that 4 electrons must be introduced into the E. coli SDH before the heme center is fully reduced. The study suggested that the heme may provide a lower energy pathway for electron transfer from the high potential [3Fe­4S] center to ubiquinone. In contrast, a recent report demonstrates that quinone reduction precedes electron transfer to heme b [64]. Taken together, the data are consistent with the interpretation that heme b may be activated only during periods of high electron flux. Electrons temporarily stored on heme b may be safely transferred to the quinone pool via the QD site. We are currently examining this possibility with simulation studies.
