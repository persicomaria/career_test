Abstract The type-II restriction endonucleases generally do not share appreciable amino acid sequence homology. The crystal structures of restriction endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI have shown these enzymes to possess striking 3D-structural resemblance, i.e., they have a similar overall fold and similar active sites, though they possess 6 23% sequence identity. Structural superimposition of EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV, and PvuII based on active site residues led to sequence alignments which showed nine possible sequence motifs. EcoRV and PvuII show a more similar pattern than EcoRI and BamHI suggesting that they belong to a different subgroup. The motifs are characterized by charged and/or hydrophobic residues. From other studies on the structure of these endonucleases, three of the motifs could be implicated in DNA binding, three in forming the active site and one in dimer formation. However, the motifs were not identifiable by regular sequence alignment methods. It is found that motif IX in BamHI is formed by reverse sequence order and the motif IX in PvuII is formed from the symmetry related monomer of the dimer. The inter-motif distance is also quite different in these cases. Of the nine motifs, motif III has been earlier identified as containing the PD motif involving one of the active site residues. These motifs were used in a modified profile analysis procedure to identify similar regions in eight other endonuclease sequences for which structures are not known. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Restriction-modi¢cation systems in bacteria have two functional components, the DNA restriction activity and the DNA methylase activity, both recognizing the same sequence. The restriction enzymes in bacteria recognize and cleave foreign DNA that is unmodi¢ed (unmethylated). The type-II restrictionmodi¢cation system consists of di¡erent enzymes for methylation and restriction, while type I and III systems have both the methylating and restricting

activities present in the same enzyme. Type-II restriction endonucleases cleave double stranded DNA in the presence of Mg2 ions with high speci¢city at sites near or within the recognition sequences. (for review see [1,2]). Type-IIs restriction endonucleases recognize asymmetric sites, 4^7 bp long and cleave in presence of Mg2 with a staggered cut, at a ¢xed distance from one side of recognition site. These are also larger than type-IIp enzymes and may contain two or more domains, a recognition domain and a cleaving domain [3]. Type-IIe enzymes have a two site DNA cleavage mechanism and resemble proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA recombination and replication [4^6]. The type-II restriction endonucleases lack appreci-

able sequence identity, ( 6 23%) (Table 1), in contrast to DNA methylases that do have some conserved motifs of amino acid sequence [7]. Hence, the restriction endonucleases have been thought to be unrelated to each other. Sequence alignment of endonucleases in conjunction with phenotypic recognition sequence data has been used in an earlier report to cluster the endonucleases [8]. X-ray crystallographic studies on type-II restriction endonucleases have shown commonality in their structures. The structures of restriction endonucleases BamHI [9], EcoRI [10,11], EcoRV [12] PvuII [13], Cfr10I [14], BglI [15] and MunI [16] have been determined and studies on the structural and functional aspects have been made [17^22]. The structural topology is comparable (Fig. 1). The structures of BamHI and EcoRI show a striking presence of a common structural fold comprising a central bundle of ¢ve L-strands and four K-helices on the sides [23]. Comparison of the structures of EcoRI and EcoRV showed that there is a common structural motif containing two acidic side chains and one basic side chain near the scissile phosphodiester bond [12]. This motif called the PDT(active site) motif was also predicted to be present in a few other type-II restriction endonucleases [1]. Homologs amongst other restriction enzymes could not be detected by Newman et al. [24] using pro¢le-based search methods based on structurally identi¢ed common core region between EcoRI and BamHI. Di¡erent sequences can give rise to very similar folds [25]. Techniques for superimposition of protein structures have been developed [26]. Superimposing such similarly folded protein structures belonging to same functional class and allowing appropriate inser-

tions or deletions in the sequences based on the structural alignment, it has been possible to ¢nd conserved motifs. Structure based sequence alignment has been reported for a variety of systems, for example, between Mengo virus and HRV14 [27], DNA methyltransferases [28,29], replication terminator protein from Bacillus subtilis [30] and zinc endopeptidases [31]. We report here the structure based sequence alignment of the type-II restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV, and PvuII and the detection of nine possible motifs. We have extended the analysis to a few other type-IIp endonucleases sequences using a pro¢le search method. 2. Materials and methods The structures of EcoRI (1ERI), BamHI (1BAM), EcoRV (4RVE) and PvuII (2PVI) were from the Protein Data Bank [32]. The set of sequences of restriction endonucleases for which structures are not known comprises representative type-IIp sequences with di¡erent substrate speci¢cities. Type-IIs endonucleases were not used for analysis as they have a two-domain structure. EcoRII, a representative of type-IIe enzymes was removed from the analysis as it is shown to be presumably a dimer of pseudodimers [33]. The sequences of 15 type-II restriction endonucleases were obtained from the SwissProt database (SwissProt IDs: BamHI (P23940), BsufBI (P25217), CviaII (P31117), Cfr10I (P56200), EcoRI (P00642), EcoRV (P04390), HhaII (P00643), MunI (P43642), NgoMI (P31032), PvuII (P23657), PstI (P00640), RsrI (P21763), Sau96I (P23736), SinI

The BglII structure (1DFM) was not available at the time the work was done and its analysis could only be included later. The structures of EcoRI, BamHI were superimposed based on the active site residues (EcoRI D91 ,

BamHI D94 ; EcoRI E111 , BamHI E111 ; EcoRI K113 , BamHI E113 ), that are placed in equivalent positions in the structures. The active site residues of EcoRV (D90 , K92 ) and PvuII (E68 , K70 ) were used as a guide to superimpose the structures of EcoRV and PvuII on the superimposition of EcoRI and BamHI. The sequences of the endonucleases were aligned based on the structural similarity. The sequence motifs were deduced from the structural alignment of EcoRI

and BamHI (Fig. 2). The motifs identi¢ed in EcoRI and BamHI were used for the pro¢le construction (Fig. 3a,b). The motifs identi¢ed from the structural alignment of EcoRV and PvuII with EcoRI and BamHI were used to validate the modi¢ed motif detection strategy (Fig. 3a). Separate pro¢les for each motif and combined pro¢le for successive motifs (Fig. 3b) were used in the motif detection strategy. These pro¢les were run against the data set of eight endonuclease sequences using pro¢lesearch [34] and pro¢lesegments of GCG package version 6.2 [35] and the motifs were identi¢ed in these eight sequences. 3. Results 3.1. Structural and sequence alignment of restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV and PvuII Structural alignment of crystallographic structures of EcoRI and BamHI show them to share a common structural fold as reported earlier. Alignment of crystallographic structures of restriction endonucleases EcoRV and PvuII based on their active site residues with the structures of EcoRI and BamHI showed that these two enzymes also share a part of the common structural fold. The sequences aligned on the basis of structural identity led to the identi¢cation of nine motifs in amino acid sequences of EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV,

and PvuII, of which ¢ve can be considered strong motifs and four weak motifs. These motifs have a conserved pattern of hydrophobic and charged residues (Fig. 3). 3.2. Motifs I^IX The nine motifs were identi¢ed in other eight endonuclease sequences based on the pro¢le of the motifs of BamHI, EcoRI, EcoRV, PvuII (Fig. 4). Motifs I and II were found by alignment A of EcoRI and BamHI sequences. Alignment A identi¢es the structurally de¢ned motifs I and II in EcoRV, while PvuII lacks the regions corresponding to motifs I and II, and for HhaII the two motifs were determined by alignment B. Motif III contains the `PD' of the catalytic site motif described earlier. This motif could be determined by alignment A. PvuII lacks this motif. Motif III for NgoMI was found using alignment B and in case of CviaII by using a separate pro¢le for motif III. The validity of this was determined by the relative position with respect to motif II and motif IV. Motif IV is identi¢ed by alignment B. This motif was not correct for EcoRV but identi¢ed as correct for PvuII. CviaII lacks this motif. Motifs V and VI are identi¢ed by alignment B. PvuII does not have a region corresponding to motif V. Motif VII is identi¢ed by alignment B. Both EcoRV and PvuII lack this region identi¢ed from structural alignment. Motif VIII is identi¢ed by alignment B. In EcoRV and

PvuII the motif VIII is not determined from the pro¢lesearch. Motif VIII is a reverse motif and could be found only by a separate pro¢le. Motif IX is identi¢ed both by a combination of alignments A, B or a separate pro¢le for motif IX. However, for PvuII, the motif IX could be identi¢ed only from structural alignment since the other monomer of the dimer contributes to the structural equivalence. 4. Discussion We used a pro¢le search method [34] with di¡erent pro¢le combinations to identify a set of nine motifs (¢ve strong, four weak), and these motifs were validated from the alignment of EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV and PvuII structures. The motif IX found in BamHI is a reverse motif i.e., it is the sequence found in the N-terminal region of the BamHI sequence, comprising residues 32^19 which are structurally similar to the region corresponding to residues 274^287 in EcoRI. There are examples where the motifs are nonlinear e.g., DNA methylases that can be classi¢ed based on linearity or non-linearity of the motifs [28]. The sequence distances between the nine motifs are not the same for each endonuclease. Moreover, standard sequence alignment programs like Clustal V [36], MACAW [37] were unable to detect any conserved motifs in the endonuclease sequences including the sequences of EcoRI and BamHI. The structure of Cfr10I is also available [14] (PDB ID: 1CFR), but it has not been used in the structurebased sequence alignment as the active site residues are not positioned in a manner similar to the active site residues in the other structures of type-II restriction endonucleases. The structure of Cfr10I was superimposed on the EcoRI structure based on the residues that are structurally equivalent to the active site residues of EcoRI. Cfr10I also shows the presence of the common core structure. Cfr10I recognizes the hexanucleotide sequence 5P-PuCCGGPy and cleaves after the ¢rst purine to produce 5P overhangs, in contrast to EcoRI and BamHI that also produce 5P overhangs but show a more stringent sequence speci¢city. Cfr10I shows structurally conserved central core comprising four L-strands sandwiched by two K-helices. When compared to EcoRI, EcoRV, BamHI and

PvuII, it lacks motifs I, II, and VII. The motif IV in Cfr10I does not seem to be containing the active site residues and in contrast has the active site residues on motif VI. This motif is likely to be involved in DNA recognition and binding from its structural similarity to EcoRI. BglI structure [15] (PDB ID: 1DMU) is the only structure of a restriction endonuclease that cleaves DNA generating 3P overhangs. BglI has the active site residues arranged spatially like the active site residues in EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV and PvuII and the structural superimposition based on its active site residues reveals a common central core. Seven motifs of the nine were found, of which two are oriented in an opposite direction as compared to EcoRI. But as the overall structure of BglI is not very similar to the structures of EcoRI and BamHI, and is more related to EcoRV and PvuII, BglI was not used for construction of pro¢le and crosschecking of pro¢les. The BglII structure [38] is an example of divergence from restriction endonucleases like BamHI (which has a similar target site), and similarity of the active site to the I-CreI homing endonuclease. Structural superimposition of BglII (PDB ID: 1DFM) showed the presence of common central core, but the structure based sequence alignment showed that the sequences in these structurally conserved regions have less homology. This also could be indicative of the di¡erences in the protein^DNA interactions. The structure of MunI [16] is related to EcoRI structure though there is little similarity in their primary sequences. As seen from the topology diagram [16], a mixed ¢ve-stranded L-sheet and two helices seem to overlap with structurally equivalent regions of EcoRI and BamHI, and so do the active site residues. This could also be expected as the recognition sequences of MunI and EcoRI are very much related. The coordinates for MunI became available (PDB ID:1D02) later. Superimposition of MunI with EcoRI and BamHI con¢rmed the motifs for MunI. Therefore, this has been included in Fig. 2 with the structurally derived motifs. Studies done on the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, RsrI, XcyI, Cfr9I and MunI [39] revealed two regions of similarity in these sequences, mapping to the structural elements forming the catalytic site

and region interacting with central nucleotides of the recognition region in EcoRI using a probabilistic evaluation of local similarities. These two regions found by Siksnys et al. [39], are the motifs III, IV, V found by our method. Repeating the procedure of motif identi¢cation with sequences that are not type-IIp restriction endonucleases or non-endonuclease sequences, such motifs could not be identi¢ed. EcoRII is a type IIe restriction endonuclease and is presumably a dimer of pseudodimers. EcoRII was initially included in the alignment. Though the second binding site motif reported earlier [33] was seen as such in motif V of the pro¢lesearch based alignment, a similar search with SsoII and Sau3AI (both type IIe enzymes) did not align the binding site motif II (which is very similar to EcoRII binding site II) of these enzymes with that of EcoRII. This possibly indicates that the structures of the type IIe enzymes would di¡er from type IIp, and a separate structurebased pro¢le would be needed for such enzymes. EcoRII and other type-IIe enzymes have not been included in the alignment. The nine motifs that were identi¢ed in the sequences of type-II restriction endonucleases occur without extensive rearrangements of order (Table 2), and motifs VIII and IX are found reversed as in case of

BamHI, EcoRV, PvuII, BglI and BglII. At least in the known structures, these reversals were found to be for the motifs existing at the C-terminus of the sequence, i.e., the complementary motifs to the Cterminal motifs in EcoRI were found to be in reverse orientation, in few endonucleases. This could be due to genetic rearrangements during the course of evolution. In PvuII, the structural alignment showed that the motif IX was contributed by the other monomer, which could be a step before the loss of the motif later on during evolution. From the structure of BamHI and EcoRI endonucleases and their complexes with cognate DNA, the motif I can be implicated in DNA binding. Motifs III and IV contain the active site residues which also comprise the `catalytic site motif'. Motifs III and IV can be implicated in forming the active site. Motif V also contains the DNA recognition region. In EcoRI, mutation studies have shown the residues E144 and R145 present in this region to be important for dimerization. It has been found that mutation in this region hampers the dimerization of the enzyme [17]. Though this motif can be implicated in dimer formation, in case of PvuII the dimer formation should involve other regions such as possibly motif IX. Motif VII forms the DNA recognition region in EcoRI and BamHI.

EI: EcoRI, BI: BamHI, EV: EcoRV, PII: PvuII, CI: Cfr10I, BII: BglI, BG: BglII, MI: MunI. Functions of motifs I, VI and VII were predicted from the structures. Speci¢c residues found to be involved in the activity from biochemical data are indicated. These residues are found conserved in the respective motifs. a The residues in these motifs (I and VI) were found to be involved in contact with DNA from an examination on the graphics. b The helix involved in this motif (VII) has been reported to be implicated in dimer formation in BamHI and MunI.

Mutational studies to check the involvement of di¡erent residues in the activity of EcoRI have been reported earlier. E111 and K113 from the active sites as shown by the re¢nement of EcoRI endonuclease structure [11] which places E111 near the sessile bond of DNA, and mutations at this point have been identi¢ed that reduce the activity of the enzyme but do not a¡ect the DNA binding [18]. Mutation of E111 to G or to Q resulted in severe cleavage defects, but replacement of this residue by D resulted in a more limited reduction in the rates of cleavage steps. Hence, it was proposed that a negative charge is required at this position for the optimal activity of this enzyme. Residues 111 and 113 are present in the motif IV that was identi¢ed by structure-based sequence alignment. Conservation of a negatively charged residue in endonucleases aligning with E111 of EcoRI seems to be signi¢cant and this could form a part of the active site of the endonuclease containing it, and so is the conservation of a charged residue at position aligning with K113 of EcoRI. So, motif IV could be a motif important in cleavage activity in the restriction endonucleases. The structure of EcoRI also showed that E144 and R145 form four hydrogen bonds to adjacent adenosine while R200 forms two hydrogen bonds with guanosine [10]. The mutational studies on these three residues [17] revealed that a double mutation of E144 R145 to Q144 K145 and a triple mutation of E144 R145 R200 to Q144 K145 K200 resulted in reduced propensity of the enzyme to form a dimer or tet-

ramer. Mutation of R145 to K145 did not impair the dimer formation as electrostatic interactions here were intact [19], but a change of E144 to Q144 abolished the electrostatic interactions. But as dimerization was still possible, it was proposed that dipolar interactions could substitute for the electrostatic interactions. A change of E144 to K144 abolished dimerization completely and no enzymatic activity was seen [22]. E144 and R145 of EcoRI can be found in motif V identi¢ed by structure-based sequence alignment, and in other endonucleases there are charged residues at positions aligning with E144 and R145 of EcoRI. Thus, motif V can be implicated in the dimer formation of these endonucleases. However, as mentioned earlier, motif IX, considering the case of PvuII, is probably also involved in dimer formation. Motif III contains the PD of the `PDT (active site residues)' motif as reported by Anderson [2], which in EcoRV and EcoRI if mutated caused a loss of cleavage activity [19,20]. As seen from the gel mobility shift assays, the complexes were intact and so this motif does not seem to be involved in binding to DNA. Charged residues seem to be an important factor in this motif and a change from that results in reduced activity. Motif III contains one of the active site residues in EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV, Cfr10I and BglI (D of the PD motif). From the structures of EcoRI, BamHI, EcoRV and PvuII, motifs I and IV could be involved in DNA binding (Table 3). Site-directed mutagenesis studies on EcoRV indi-

cated the involvement of S183 , N185 , T186 and N188 in the binding/cleavage of DNA [40]. This region is not identi¢ed by our structure-based sequence analysis method as any of the motifs. Additionally, there are regions in Cfr10I that superimpose well with certain regions of EcoRV but not with EcoRI, BamHI. Thus, our method has been able to de¢ne a common structural/functional core, which is similar in these restriction endonucleases despite the di¡erences in cleavage pattern, but may not include all the functional aspects of each endonuclease. EcoRV and PvuII seem to belong to a class di¡erent from EcoRI and BamHI and show di¡erence in the residues conserved for these enzymes. Our results have pointed out the existence of possible conserved sequence motifs in the type-II restriction endonucleases. These motifs serve as basis for structure^function studies on type-IIp restriction endonucleases (Table 3). As the standard multiple sequence alignment methods fail to identify these motifs, there is a need to design methods that would be able to ¢nd such motifs taking into account and allowing variability of sequence lengths between motifs. Such methods based on structural alignments could also provide means to allow identi¢cation of sequence reversals.
