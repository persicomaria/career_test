Astrocyte cell cultures were established from human fetal brains and exposed to human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and human recombinant interferon gamma (IFNy), and the proliferative response was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine-immunostaining technique. TNFu showed an inhibitory activity, while IFNy induced a slight increase in the number of astrocytes undergoing cell division. However, in both experiments differences were not statistically significant. Previous studies have demonstrated that TNFa and IFNy are potent mitogens for adult astrocytes in both in vivo and in vitro conditions. Our results suggest that in developing brain the immunomodulatory activity of cytokines, TNFa and IFNy, is different from that observed in adult brain.

Cytokines are secretory products of mononuclear cells that function as immunoregulatory factors and, therefore, modulate the immune reactions in different tissues, including the nervous system. In particular, several members of the cytokine family such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&) and interferon gamma (IFNy) have been reported to strongly affect immune responses of the central nervous system [5]. These molecules stimulate microglial cells and astrocytes to proliferate [ 1, 10, 12, 141, to express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens [3, 10, 151, to function as antigen-presenting cells [4], and also to secrete cytokines [8]. Thus, by modulating the activity of glial cells, TNFcl and IFNy might control the evolution of inflammatory and reparative processes accompanying injuries of different etiology that occur in the brain. However, while the cytokine-glial cell interactions in the postnatal and adult brain are established, little is known about the effects of these molecules on the developing nervous system. In the present study, cultured human fetal astrocytes were exposed to TNFa and IFNy, and their proliferative response was assessed by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)immunostaining technique. The aim of the present study was to examine if cytokines could influence the proliferation of human astrocytes.

Astrocytes were isolated from the brain of human fetuses, legally and therapeutically aborted at 12-15 weeks of gestation. After removing meninges, brains were diced, incubated with 0.25% trypsin and 0.002% DNAse in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 37°C and then dissociated into single cells by gentle pipetting. Cell suspension was washed twice in feeding medium, resuspended in feeding medium and plated onto 9-mm Aclar poly+lysine-coated coverslips. Feeding medium, consisting of Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% glucose and 20 pg/rnl gentamicin, was changed once a week. Between 10 and 20 days in vitro (DIV), cultures were used for the present experiments. Cells were incubated with the following cytokines: recombinant human TNFcl (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA; 10, 100,200 U/ml) and recombinant human IFNy (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA; 10, 100, 1000 U/ml) for 4 days. During the last 2 days, BrdU (Sigma) at the final concentration of 10 ,uM was added to the growth medium. Control cultures were incubated only with BrdU. Cells were immunostained with rabbit antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Dakopatts, 1:100) and then followed by mouse monoclonal antibody to BrdU (Becton Dickison, 1:5) [ 131.After staining, cells on coverslips were mounted with Gelvatol and examined under a Zeiss Universal fluorescence microscope. Under the fluorescence microscope, at x200 magnifi-

cation, a quantitative analysis of proliferating activity was carried out. This was done by counting 100-300 GFAP+ astrocytes in 20 fields for each coverslip; of these astrocytes, the number of cells incorporating nuclear BrdU was also assessed. Each single value reported in Table I represents the sum from 5 coverslips. The proliferating index (PI) was calculated by dividing the mean percentage of proliferating astrocytes from exposed cultures with that of control [13]. The significance of the results from control and cytokine-treated cultures was analyzed by single factor ANOVA analysis with P < 0.05. A large number of human fetal astrocytes, identified by their expression of GFAP at immunofluorescence, showed a flat fibroblast-like morphology which did not change during their maintenance in vitro up to several months. These flat fibroblast-like GFAP+ astrocytes were classified as type 1 astrocytes, while smaller process-bearing GFAP+ cells were seen as type 2 astrocytes in rat brain cultures by Raff and his associates [6]. Under the basal conditions with serum-containing medium examined between 14 and 24 DIV, 18-30% of these control astrocytes underwent cell division and incorporated BrdU in their nuclei (Fig. la,b).

A 4-day exposure to TNFa resulted in a slight decrease in the number of proliferating astrocytes (Fig. lc,d); this prevailing course was dose-dependent, and it was found in all the experiments (Table I). On the other hand, exposure to IFN resulted in increased proliferative activity at concentrations of 100 and 1000 U/ml (Fig. le,f; Table I). However, when statistical analysis was performed, differences between control and exposed cultures were not significant, both in TNFa and IFNy experiments. PI values ranged from 0.61 to 0.79 after TNFa treatment and from 0.97 to 1.25 after IFNy exposure; this further confirms the absence of proliferative influence of TNFol and IFNy as previously reported by others [l, 10, 12, 141. When experiments were performed in serum-free medium (data not shown) instead of 10% FBS, final results were similar to those described above. Finally, cell morphology of astrocytes did not undergo any change after incubation with either of the cytokines. Our results demonstrated that TNFcll and IFNy did not significantly modify the proliferative capacity of human astrocytes in vitro; in addition, no other morphological changes were detected at microscopic level after TNFcl and IFNy treatment. The biology of cytokines has been extensively investigated, and their importance in immune reactions within the central nervous system is well-recognized. However, effector mechanisms by which these molecules activate the responses of target cells are still largely unknown [9]. Therefore, studying these aspects of the cytokine-astrocyte interactions may provide new insights to better understand pathological processes [5] that accompany ischemic, intlammatory, and traumatic injuries of the CNS. TNFa, a 17.3 kDa glycoprotein encoded in chromosome 6 and mainly secreted by monocytes/macrophages, produces cytotoxic and cytostatic effects when it binds to the surface receptor of target cells. In the nervous system, TNFa has been reported as promoting proliferation of mature bovine and human astrocytes [l, 10, 121 mediating myelin and oligodendrocyte damage [ 1l] and inducing expression of ICAM- [7]. A proliferative response of mature human astrocytes has also been reported after exposure to IFNy [14], a 20-25 kDa glycoprotein encoded in chromosome 12 in the human genome. Moreover, these cytokines are believed to operate synergistically, at a molecular level, in modulating class II MHC antigen expression on astrocytes [3, 151. At variance with the above reported studies, by employing the accurate and unambiguous BrdU technique, we found that these cytokines were not growth factors for human astrocytes in vitro. In particular, TNFa appeared rather to produce some inhibitory effects on cell proliferation (Table I). This discrepancy may reflect mis-

match effects of human TNFcl in bovine glial cells [lo] and non-physiological response of transformed human cell line to human TNFcl in earlier studies [l]. Alternatively, interactions between cytokines and astrocytes of various stages of cell development could result in different responses. Observations from animal experiments that, following an injury, only a mild and circumscribed degree of gliosis was produced in the immature brain while adult astrocytes proliferated extensively [2], support our contention of different patterns of astrocytic reactions associated with development. Our results on human fetal astrocytes in vitro reflect these considerations and suggest that cytokines might influence the behavior of these glial cells.
