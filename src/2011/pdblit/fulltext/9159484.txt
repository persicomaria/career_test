Determination of the Structure of Oxidised Desulfovibrio africanus Ferredoxin I by 1H NMR Spectroscopy and Comparison of its Solution Structure with its Crystal Structure
Sharon L. Davy, Michael J. Osborne and Geoffrey R. Moore*
Centre for Metalloprotein Spectroscopy and Biology School of Chemical Sciences University of East Anglia Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK The solution structure of the 64 amino acid Fe4S4 ferredoxin I from Desulfovibrio africanus has been determined using two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. Sequence-speci®c assignments were obtained for 59 amino acid residues and the structure determined with the program DIANA on the basis of 549 nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) upper distance limits, and four dihedral angle and 52 distance constraints for the Fe4S4 cluster. The NMR structure was re®ned using the simulated annealing and energy minimisation protocols of the program X-PLOR to yield a ®nal family of 19 structures selected on the basis of good covalent geometry and minimal restraint violations. The r.m.s.d. values to the average Ê Ê structure for this family are 0.49(Æ0.07) A and 0.94(Æ0.09) A for the backbone and heavy-atoms of residues 3 to 62, respectively. The NMR structure has been compared to the previously reported X-ray structures for the two molecules within the asymmetric unit of the crystal, which have a network of seven hydrogen bonds between them. This intermolecular interface, involving residues 38, 40 to 43 and 46, has the same conformation in the solution structures showing that the crystal packing does not perturb the structure. There are three regions in which the NMR and X-ray structures differ: around the cluster, a turn involving residues 8 to 10, and a loop involving residues 29 to 32. In the family of solution structures the backbone of the loop region incorporating residues 29 to 32 is well-de®ned whilst in both of the X-ray molecules it is illde®ned. The small differences between the X-ray and NMR structures for the cluster environment and the turn between residues 8 to 10 probably re¯ects a lack of NMR constraints. The observation of relatively rapid amide NH hydrogen exchange of NH groups close to the cluster, together with rapid ¯ipping for Phe25, which is also close to the cluster, indicates that the cluster environment is more dynamic than the corresponding regions of related Fe/S proteins.

Introduction
Proteins containing Fe4S4 centres take part in a variety of electron transfer and dehydrationhydration reactions, and act as control elements in both transcription and translation (Beinert et al., 1997). Consequently the structural bases for the determination of their properties is of considerable interest. The simplest Fe4S4-containing proteins are members of the HiPIP and ferredoxin classes. In these, the functional oxidised forms contain 3Fe(III)/1Fe(II) and 2Fe(III)/2Fe(II) clus# 1998 Academic Press Limited

684 ters, respectively. Our interest with Fe4S4-containing ferredoxins centres around understanding their complex patterns of cluster redox chemistry, particularly those involving coupled electron-proton transfer (Armstrong et al., 1989) and cluster transformation reactions (Butt et al., 1991a,b; Beinert et al., 1997). Some of the ferredoxins exhibiting these properties are structurally uncharacterised because crystals of the protein suitable for X-ray diffraction have not been obtained. Therefore, we have turned to high-®eld NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structures of ferredoxins (Davy et al., 1994, 1995). This has been an extremely active ®eld of research in recent years (Cheng & Markley, 1995; Bertini et al., 1996c) with three-dimensional structures being reported for Fe2S2-containing ferredoxins (Pochapsky et al., 1994; Baumann et al., 1996; Hatanaka et al., 1997) and Fe4S4-containing ferredoxins (Bertini et al., 1995a; Wang et al., 1996; Sticht et al., 1996) and HiPIPs (Banci et al., 1994b, 1995; Bertini et al., 1995b, 1996b; Bentrop et al., 1996). Good quality structures have been obtained, particularly where 15N labelling and isotope-edited NMR have been employed (Bertini et al., 1996b). However, it is generally accepted that in the presence of a paramagnetic FexSx centre good de®nition of the immediate vicinity of the cluster is not possible from 2D NOESY measurements alone. This has led to modelling using X-ray structures to improve the quality of NMR structures, as well as the inclusion of a variety of paramagnetic NMR restraints into the NMR structure calculations (Bertini et al., 1996c). These paramagnetic restraints include Fe-S-Cb-Hb and/or Fe-S-Cb-Ca dihedral angles determined from ligand cysteine hyper®ne shifts and linewidths (Bertini et al., 1994; Davy et al., 1995), NOE connectivities determined from one-dimensional NOE difference spectra (Banci et al., 1994a,b), and nuclear T1 values (Huber et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1996; Bertini et al., 1996b). More recently, Bertini et al. (1996a) have shown that a relaxation matrix analysis of the effect of paramagnetic-induced relaxation on the intensities of NOEs led to an improved structure of an oxidised HiPIP. Further improvement in obtaining structural constraints for the cluster vicinity from the NMR data has been achieved by the same group with a 13C/15N-labelled sample of reduced Ectothiorhodospira halophila HiPIP I (Bertini et al., 1996b). Desulfovibrio africanus has a variety of distinctive ferredoxins including ferredoxin I, which contains a single Fe4S4 cluster (Bruschi & Hatchikian, 1982; Hatchikian et al., 1984). An outline three-dimensional structure of this protein has been proposed based on a comparison of the amino acid sequences of structurally characterised ferredoxins with that of D. africanus ferredoxin I (Fukuyama et al., 1988), and its structure determined by single Ê Â crystal X-ray diffraction at 2.3 A resolution (Sery et al., 1994). There are independent X-ray structures

Structure of Oxidised D. africanus Ferredoxin I

for the two molecules within the asymmetric unit Â of the crystal, which Sery et al. (1994) report have a network of seven hydrogen bonds between them. We initiated two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic studies of this ferredoxin several years ago, which led to some of its secondary structure being determined (Davy et al., 1994). That NMR study con®rmed that the paramagnetic nature of the cluster affected the quality of the data. In addition to this, our early work was handicapped by the discovery of errors in the published amino acid sequence. The correct sequence has now been reported (Davy Âry et al., 1994) and using this, et al., 1994; Se together with NMR-determined structural constraints, we have determined the structure of the paramagnetic, oxidised ferredoxin I in aqueous solution using distance geometry (DG), DG-simulated annealing and restrained energy minimization re®nement protocols. The NMR resonance assignments and structure are reported here together with a comparison of the solution and crystal structures of D. africanus ferredoxin I. Although a direct comparison between solution and solid state structures has been reported for a HiPIP from Chromatium vinosum (Banci et al., 1995; Bertini et al., 1995b), the equivalent analysis for a ferredoxin has not. The number of structurally characterised ferredoxins is still relatively small and thus, for example, the solution structure of the 2 Â Fe4S4 ferredoxin from Clostridium pasterianum (Bertini et al., 1995a) was compared to the X-ray structure of an oxidised 2 Â Fe4S4 ferredoxin from ClostriÂe dium acidurici (Due et al., 1994), as its own X-ray structure has not been reported. D. africanus ferredoxin I is only the second Fe4S4 ferredoxin for which both the NMR and X-ray structures are available, the other being the ferredoxin from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis (Wang et al., 1996; Macedo-Ribeiro et al., 1996). Here we report the ®rst detailed structural comparison between a solution and a solid state structure of an oxidised Fe4S4 ferredoxin.

Results
Resolution and assignment of 1H resonances The methodology for identi®cation of amino acid 1H NMR spin systems has been well docuÈ mented (Wuthrich, 1986). In the present case the DQF-COSY spectrum of a sample in 90% H2O/ 10% 2H2O was used to identify the backbone NH-aCH connectivities (Davy et al., 1994). Of an expected 62 NH-aCH cross-peaks (64 residues minus three prolines and the N terminus with two glycine residues having non-degenerate aCH hydrogen atoms), 48 were observed (Figure 1). The signals not observed may have been missing because of overlap with the HO2H resonance, saturation-transfer, or because their relaxation times were too short. Since the cross-peaks of both glycine residues were observed, only 46 residues

were detected in the ®ngerprint region of the DQFCOSY spectrum. TOCSY spectra were used to assign additional resonances, and thus identify further spin systems, with NOESY spectra (mixing times of 100, 150 and 200 ms) used to obtain sequential assignments. Intraresidue correlations from 44 NH hydrogen atoms to side-chain hydrogen atoms were observed in the amide region of ferredoxin I in 90% H2O with a spin-lock time of 120 ms. On the same sample a TOCSY spectrum recorded with a spin-lock time of 50 ms showed an additional nine spin systems. Thus a total of 53 spin systems with correlations to NH hydrogen atoms were identi®ed. Eighteen of these were assigned to particular residue types: a serine and a threonine, two each of isoleucine, glycine and lysine, four valine and six alanine. A further 18 were identi®ed as potential AMX spin systems and 14 as AM(PT)X. The spin system designations of the remaining three could not be determined. Analysis of the aliphatic region identi®ed a further ®ve spin systems without detectable NH hydrogen correlations. One of these was identi®ed as a proline. Six aromatic ring patterns and three geminal glutamine side-chain

amide correlations from eNH2 hydrogen atoms were also observed. Sequence-speci®c assignments for residues 3 to 10, 18 to 53 and 59 to 64 were relatively straightforward (Davy et al., 1994; Davy, 1996), even for Ala34, for which only an aCH resonance was detected. The speci®c assignments for the remaining residues were complicated by the effect of the paramagnetism of the Fe4S4 centre. With the exception of the N-terminal residues all the remaining residues unassigned at this stage are sequentially close to the cluster ligating residues (Cys11, Cys14, Cys17 and Cys54), which dictates their close spatial proximity to the cluster. Previous work with NMR experiments tailored for rapidly relaxing signals had led to the tentative identi®cation of side-chain resonances of the co-ordinated cysteine residues themselves (Davy et al., 1995) and assignments for Ile12, Gln57 and Cys58 were obtained from similar experiments. The spin system of Ile12 was identi®ed from the strong 1D NOE between its sidechain hydrogen resonance at 1.13 ppm and a bCH hydrogen resonance of Cys14 (Davy et al., 1995; Davy, 1996), and assigned to one of the ®ve aliphatic spin systems identi®ed in 2D TOCSY

686 spectra for which no correlation to an NH resonance had been observed. Its amide hydrogen remains undetected. The spin system assigned to Gln57 was only observed in TOCSY and NOESY spectra recorded with short spin-lock or mixing times (50 ms and 30 ms, respectively) and no interresidue correlations were present for this system in any NOESY spectrum. The assignment was actually obtained from 1D NOE data reported by Davy et al. (1995): an NOE to a previously unassigned peak at 4.08 ppm, the aCH of Gln57, was observed upon saturation of a bCH resonance of Cys54. Interresidue correlations involving a spin system identi®ed to be from Cys58 were observed in both 100 ms and 30 ms mixing time NOESY spectra, though more correlations were observed in the shorter mixing time spectrum, suggesting that this residue is spatially close to the paramagnetic cluster. No NOEs were observed to the amide resonance, whose assignment was obtained from a weak intraresidue NH-aCH correlation observed in a 50 ms TOCSY spectrum. The diagonal resonance of this amide hydrogen was not observed in this spectrum. Long-range NOESY connectivities to Asp7 and Glu10 aided the Cys58 assignment once structure calculations had produced an outline structure. In total, sequence-speci®c assignments for 59 of the 64 amino acid residues of ferredoxin I were obtained. Of the remainder, tentative assignments for three residues have been made, two of which include both backbone NH and aCH resonances

Structure of Oxidised D. africanus Ferredoxin I

(Ala1 and Glu15), while for the other (Ala13) only the aCH and side-chain resonances have been identi®ed (Davy, 1996). Resonances of the remaining two spin systems (Ser16 and Val56) have not been identi®ed. Since data involving these tentatively assigned residues was not used in the NMR structure calculations we do not consider them further. A full listing of the assignments used for the structure calculation is given in Supplementary material. NH 3 N2H exchange The exchange of amide hydrogen atoms with deuterium was monitored by comparison of TOCSY spectra recorded on a 90% H2O/10% 2H2O sample with data recorded on a freshly prepared 99.9% 2H2O sample (Figure 2). Three distinct rates of exchange were identi®ed from these data: fast, intermediate, and slow. Fast exchange describes amide hydrogen atoms which were not observed in TOCSY spectra acquired within a few hours of the solvent exchange; intermediate denotes amide hydrogen atoms detected in such spectra but not in spectra acquired 48 hours after solvent exchange with 2H2O; and slow exchange designates the amide hydrogen atoms observed in these latter spectra. All of the slowly exchanging NH resonances persisted for several years. Of the 52 backbone amide hydrogen atoms observed in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O, 23 were identi®ed as fast exchanging, two as intermediate and the remaining 27 as slowly exchanging (Figure 3). These NH-N2H

Residues 25 to 36 (excluding 29 and 34) have been highlighted to demonstrate the importance of these data in establishing slow exchanging amide hydrogen atoms and potential regions of secondary structure (see the text for details).

Unassigned residues are denoted by an asterisk (*), tentative assignments by # and assigned residues for which the amide hydrogen has not been observed (with the exception of proline residues) by {. A ®lled circle denotes a slowly exchanging amide hydrogen still observed after the sample has been dissolved in 2H2O for years; a half-circle denotes an amide hydrogen with an intermediate rate of exchange (see the text). , À and 0 refer to aCH chemical shifts which are greater than, less than and within 0.10 ppm of the random coil value, respectively. Regions of secondary structure predicted from these data are indicated.

exchange data enabled the identi®cation of potential regions of secondary structures and the reduction in observable spin systems in the amide region of the TOCSY spectrum with exchange of solvent aided assignments by alleviating problems of overlap (Figure 2). Secondary structure Potential secondary structure elements were È identi®ed from NOEs (Wuthrich, 1986), the chemical shift index (CSI; Wishart et al., 1992) and NH-N2H exchange data. The presence of a helix incorporating residues 44 to 53 in ferredoxin I was previously indicated by strong dNN(i,i  1) correlations but a distinction between an a-helix and a 310-helix was not made (Davy et al., 1994). Further analysis of the NOESY data show there are clear daN(i,i  3), dab(i,i  3) and daN(i,i  4) correlations (Figure 3) which con®rm that it is an È a-helix (Wuthrich, 1986). The assignment of these interresidue correlations was complicated by overlap of degenerate resonances, but enough of them were unambiguously assigned for the

a-helix designation to be secure. Additional support for this is provided by the NH exchange data and aCH chemical shift values. Only three out of the ten amide hydrogen atoms of Gln44 to Thr53 were shown to be labile (Figure 3). The non-labile behaviour of the remainder are consistent with these amides taking part in hydrogen bonding. The CSI predicts that the aCH hydrogen atoms of residues comprising an a-helix will be shifted up®eld compared to their random-coil chemical shift (Wishart et al., 1992), as observed for all the aCH hydrogen resonances of residues Gln44 to Asp52 (Figure 3). The magnitude of these shifts ranged from 0.15 ppm (Glu45) to 1.00 ppm (Ala50 and Met51). A b-sheet structure connecting the N terminus to the C terminus of the polypeptide chain was identi®ed by NOEs between two strands comprising Lys3 to Val6 and Ile59 to Glu62 (Davy et al., 1994). The determination of the b-sheet structure was initiated by the observation of a strong NOE between aCH hydrogen resonances at 5.65 ppm and 5.22 ppm, which arise from Phe4 and Trp61, respectively. Though two intense cross-peaks from

The sequential daN(i,i  1) and indicative daa(i,j), dNN(i,j) and daN(i,j) NOEs detected are shown as arrows. Hydrogen-bonding residues deduced from NH exchange data are shown in red.

daa(i,j) correlations are expected for this b-sheet structure only the one between Phe4 and Trp61 was observed. The anticipated Val6/Ile59 correlation was not detected, probably as a consequence of the aCH hydrogen of Ile59 at 4.72 ppm overlapping the solvent resonance. However, the number of other long-range correlations was suf®cient to determine that this b-sheet is antiparallel (Figure 4(a)). In contrast to the up®eld shift of the aCH hydrogen atoms of residues involved in a-helices, the aCH hydrogen atoms of residues

involved in b-sheet structures are predicted to be shifted down®eld (Wishart et al., 1992). This trend is observed for all eight residues encompassing Lys3 to Val6 and Ile59 to Glu62, though the extent of the shift is variable ranging from 0.05 ppm (Lys3) to 0.99 ppm (Phe4). Furthermore, the amide hydrogen atoms of Tyr5 and His60 exchange slowly with solvent, consistent with their involvement in hydrogen bonding. Two additional secondary structure elements were assigned simultaneously: an antiparallel

Structure of Oxidised D. africanus Ferredoxin I

689 sistent with these residues forming part of an antiparallel b-sheet. The observation of the amide NH of Phe25 in the spectrum of Figure 2(b) implies that this residue is buried in the tertiary structure or involved in a hydrogen bond with another part of the protein (see below). For the tight turn between Pro29 and Glu32, the indicative NOEs were sequential (i,i  1) correlations such as dNN(i,i  1) and daN(i,i  1) for Glu30-Ile31 and Ile31Glu32 and a dNa(i,i  1) correlation between Ile31 and Glu32. A medium-range NOE between the aCH resonance of Glu30 and the NH resonance of Glu32 was also observed. The down®eld shift predicted for aCH hydrogen atoms of b-sheets from the CSI (Wishart et al., 1992) is observed for each of the residues Ala26 to Asp28 and Lys33 to Val36, but a common trend of secondary structure shifts is not present for the residues involved in the turn. The aCH hydrogen resonances of Pro29 and Ile31 are shifted down®eld, the aCH hydrogen resonance of Glu30 is not signi®cantly shifted, and the aCH hydrogen resonance of Glu32 is shifted up®eld (Figure 3). Quality of the tertiary structure The determination of the experimental distance constraints and the computational procedures used

b-sheet involving residues Phe25 to Asp28 and the complementary strand Lys33 to Val36, and a fourresidue tight turn involving Pro29 to Glu32 (Figure 4(b)). The assignment of the aCH resonance at 5.30 ppm to Met27 was the starting point for the determination of these two secondary structure elements. An NOE was observed between this resonance and that of the amide hydrogen of Asp28 at 9.19 ppm. An NH-NH NOE between Asp28 and a hitherto unassigned resonance at 6.94 ppm was also seen. Since the NH groups could not be sequential to Pro29 the NOE was clearly a medium or long-range interaction. Furthermore, the NH hydrogen of Asp28 was also identi®ed as being close to an aCH hydrogen resonating at 5.92 ppm. A NOE between the 5.92 ppm resonance and the amide hydrogen of Tyr35 was also observed. Finally, the observation of a strong dNN(i,j) connectivity between Ala26 and Tyr35 further reduced the possible assignments which would satisfy all the correlations stated above. Consequently, Lys33 was assigned to the residue at 6.94 ppm and the aCH at 5.92 ppm to Ala34. The NH of Ala34 remains unobserved. These correlations, and others which permitted the assignment of this antiparallel b-sheet, are given in Figure 4(b). The slow exchange behaviour of the NH resonances of Ala26, Asp28, Lys33 and Tyr35 (Figure 2) is con-

A summary of the constraints used for the structure calculations are given in Table 1, and a statistical overview of the calculated structures is given in Table 2. Both the global mean pairwise r.m.s.d. values of the 19 structures and the r.m.s.d. values relative to the calculated average structure are listed for all residues, 1 to 64, and also for residues 3 to 62. Comparison of the equivalent statistics for the DG structures calculated with DIANA and the re®ned structures shows that an improvement in the precision of the structure has been achieved using the DG-simulated annealing and re®nement protocols of X-PLOR. For example, the backbone and heavyatom r.m.s.d. values to the average structure for Ê residues 3 to 62 have decreased from 0.56(Æ0.20) A Ê , respectively, for the family and 0.98(Æ0.25) A Ê of DIANA structures to 0.49(Æ0.07) A and Ê 0.94(Æ0.09) A, respectively, for the re®ned structures. The decrease in standard deviations between the two families is particularly striking. No NOE Ê violations >0.5 A were observed for any of the 19 structures, and the four cluster dihedral angle constraints were satis®ed in all 19. The average deviations from these experimental constraints, and

those of the covalent geometric parameters of the intrinsic X-PLOR force ®eld (bond lengths, bond angles and improper angles), are listed in Table 2, together with the individual energetic contributors of the force ®eld to the overall energy of the system and the total energy. The magnitudes of these deviations and energy terms are comparable with the corresponding values typically found for protein structures determined by NMR (Hendrickson È & Wuthrich, 1991 ±1997). The Ramachandran plot for all 19 ®nal solution structures of ferredoxin I is shown in Figure 5. In a minority of the structures two residues have f/c combinations in the disallowed regions: Cys54 (3 structures) and Gln57 (7 structures). Over the 19 structures this represents <1% of residues exhibiting unfavourable conformations. A total of 65% are found in the most favoured regions, 28% in the additionally allowed regions and the remaining 6% in the generously allowed regions, as determined by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al., 1996). Residues commonly found in the generously allowed regions are Phe4, Tyr5, Ala13, Ala21 and Glu32 (Figure 5). Collectively, the Ramachandran plot, the r.m.s.d. values and the small deviations from

For a more detailed analysis of atomic deviation within the family, plots of mean r.m.s.d. values from the average structure for both backbone and heavy-atoms are given in Figure 7(a) for each residue. The distribution of the experimental NOE data over the 64

residues of ferredoxin I is shown in Figure 7(b). From the data of Figure 7(a) and the two representations of the family of structures in Figure 6, the relative precision of different regions of the NMRdetermined structure can be identi®ed. We describe regions which have backbone r.m.s.d. Ê values greater than the average of 0.49(Æ0.07) A (for residues 3 to 62) as poorly de®ned, and discuss possible reasons for the lack of de®nition below. However, we note that the overall precision of the backbone for the family of structures is good, as judged by comparison with corresponding data for other NMR determined structures (Hendrickson & È Wuthrich, 1991-1997). Ala13 and Lys37 exhibit the largest individual Ê Ê backbone r.m.s.d. values; 0.93 A and 0.83 A, respectively. The high r.m.s.d. value of Ala13 can be readily explained: no NOEs have been detected

The statistical analysis of this family is given in Table 2. (b) A sausage representation of the overlay in (a). The width and colouring are representative of the r.m.s.d. values for each residue relative to the average structure (created in MOLMOL). Red indicates residues with an Ê average r.m.s.d. value >0.75 A, orange r.m.s.d. values Ê >0.49 A, and yellow indicates residues which have Ê r.m.s.d. values <0.49 A. The average global backbone r.m.s.d. values for residues 3 to 62 are given in Table 2.

for this particular residue whose assignment remains tentative. However, Lys37 has been ®rmly assigned with a higher than average number of NOEs (Figure 7). Its poor de®nition is a direct re¯ection of the type of NOEs it experiences with only one long-range backbone NOE identi®ed (NH Lys37-aCH Phe25). Additionally, Lys37 is situated on the surface of the protein with its aCH and side-chain protruding outward towards the solvent, which may account for the fact that the side-chain of Lys37 is the least well-de®ned of any for residues 3 to 62 inclusive. Other residues which have larger than average backbone r.m.s.d. values (Figure 7(a)) can be segregated into three broad groups: those involved in turns (Gln8 to Glu10, Pro22, Glu30 and residues Val39 to Ala42), those close to the cluster (Ile12, Cys14 and Pro55 to Gln57), and those towards the C terminus. Analogous to Lys37, residues 8 to 10 and Pro22 are remote from other regions of the protein, and, although locally they are wellde®ned, a lack of long-range NOEs results in their poor de®nition between structures. For residues 39 to 42 the poor r.m.s.d. values of all four residues is largely a result of the poor NOE data for residues

39 and 40: one long-range side-chain interaction for Val39 and for Gly40, only NOEs with residues 38 to 42. In contrast, the local environment of residues 41 and 42 within the folded polypeptide has been established by long-range NOEs, both backbone and side-chain, to the Gly23-Ala24 region of the protein. For the residues close to the cluster the poor de®nition is due to a lack of experimental constraints (Figure 7(b)), which is a consequence of the paramagnetism of the cluster. Val56 remains unassigned whilst NOE data for Ile12 (one NOE), Cys14 (no amide assignment), Pro55 (one NOE) and Gln57 (three NOEs) have been derived from the non-quantitative one-dimensional experiments (see Materials and Methods). The distribution of the average r.m.s.d. values for the side-chains of each amino acid in ferredoxin I is less straightforward to account for than the backbone r.m.s.d. values, as very few sequential residues exhibit similar values (see Figure 7(a)). Although a correlation between residues with larger than average backbone r.m.s.d. values is

693 discussed above. In Figure 8, one structure which is representative of the family is shown. Of the major secondary structure elements predicted, the two a-helices comprising residues 16 to 20 and 44 to 53 were present in all 19 structures (although shortening by one residue was observed in some structures). The ®rst b-sheet, involving residues 3 to 6 and residues 59 to 62, is present in 16 of the 19 structures, and in the remaining three structures the close orientation of the strand residues is recognised by MOLMOL with residues 3 and 62, and 6 and 59, identi®ed as forming bridges. The second b-sheet, that between residues 25 to 28 and 33 to 36, was the least de®ned of the major secondary structure elements. However, its de®nition in the majority of the structures, together with the close proximity in the other structures of residue 25 to 36, and residue 28 to 33, permits its inclusion in Figure 8. Also, additional turns to the one connecting the two strands of the second b-sheet (residues 29 to 32) were consistently seen in four regions of the structure: residues 8 to 10, 22 to 24, 39 to 42 and 55 to 56. Definition of the cluster and its immediate environment in the NMR structure

Figure 8. Ribbon diagram of the secondary structure of ferredoxin I consistently found in the family of 19 structures (see the text). The major secondary structures comprise two a-helices, residues 16 to 20 and residues 44 to 53, (purple) and two antiparallel b-sheets, residues 3 to 6 with 59 to 62 and residues 25 to 28 with 33 to 36, (yellow). Five turns were also identi®ed at positions 8 to 10, 22 to 24, 29 to 32, 39 to 42 and 55 to 56 in the sequence (red).

observed, the percentage of residues with heavyatom r.m.s.d. values greater than the mean Ê (0.94(Æ0.09) A) has risen to 40%. The small number of relevant distance constraints for de®nition of the side-chains is responsible for the statistics quoted above. Reasons for this include: the residue remains unassigned, e.g. Ser16 and Val56; no interresidue NOEs have been observed at all, e.g. Ala13 and Glu15; the inability to identify side-chain NOEs with absolute certainty due to overlapping resonances even though the side-chains are within the interior of the protein structure; and the lack of de®nition is a real property of the protein structure, perhaps because the side-chain is on the surface of the protein, e.g. Glu30 and Glu32. Finally, there is good agreement between the elements of secondary structure, determined with MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996), that are present in the ®nal structures with those suggested by the indicative NOEs, CSI and NH-N2H exchange data

For the purpose of this study the cluster environÊ ment is de®ned as a sphere of 5.00 A radius centred at each Fe atom of the Fe4S4 cluster. Nuclei within this area are in¯uenced by the paramagnetic nature of the cluster and from our work, and that of others on related proteins (e.g. see Nettesheim et al., 1992; Gaillard et al., 1992, 1993; Teng et al., 1994; Cheng & Markley, 1995; Bertini et al., 1995a; Sticht et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1996), the number of experimentally obtained structural constraints is relatively poor around the cluster compared to other regions of the protein. However, due to the functional properties of the cluster and its environment, de®nition of residues in this region is particularly important. The distances and bond angles intrinsic to the Fe4S4 cluster and those involving the gS atoms of the cluster-ligating ligands for ferredoxin I determined in this work are very similar to those reported for other Fe4S4-containing ferredoxins

The nomenclature of I, II, III and IV represents the ®rst, second, etc. cluster ligand of the ferredoxin motif (Cammack, 1992). For D. africanus ferredoxin I this corresponds to Cys11, Cys14, Cys17 and Cys54, respectively. For the X-ray structures the angles have been obtained from analysis of the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The difference in the ICa-ICb-ISg-Fe1 dihedral angle between the solution and X-ray structure of D. africanus Fd I can be clearly seen (see the text). Both values are, however, similar to the identical angle exhibited by the other ferredoxins listed.

Average distances and angles over all 19 Ê structures for ferredoxin I are: Fe...Fe 2.84 A; S...S Ê Ê 3.65 A; Fe-S 2.33 A; gS-Fe 2.18; Fe-S-Fe $75 , S-Fe-S $104 and gS-Fe-S $115 . In Table 3 the Ca-Cb-Sg-Fe angles for each cysteine covalently bonded to the cluster are listed for the solution and X-ray structures of ferredoxin I together with those for a selection of other ferredoxin structures. The difference in the Ca-Cb-Sg-Fe dihedral angle for Cys11 predicted from the bCH chemical shifts (Davy et al., 1995; value 73.5 ) and crystal structures (values of 51.7 (Mol I) and 58.9 (Mol II)) of ferredoxin I remains unresolved upon determination of the solution state structure. Examination of the solution structure of ferredoxin I does not identify any environmental factor (e.g. ring currents) which may in¯uence the determination of this angle by the relationship described by Davy et al. (1995). In the crystal structure this dihedral angle shows the largest difference between Mol I and Mol II for any of the four ligating cysteine residues (Table 3), and in both NMR and X-ray structures the value for this angle is within the ranges exhibited in other Fe4S4 cluster-containing ferredoxins (Table 3). The cluster environment for all 19 structures of ferredoxin I is shown in Figure 9 with the complementary displacement from the calculated mean structure for each residue calculated by MOLMOL for this overlay given in Table 4. Fifteen residues have been identi®ed within the cluster environment: Cys11 through to Val18 inclusive, Phe25, Ala34 and Cys54 through to Cys58. With the exception of Phe25 and Ala34, the close proximity of these residues to the cluster is dictated by their sequence position relative to the cluster-ligating cysteine residues. Residues 11 to 18 include three cluster-ligating cysteines, and has been described as the large loop, whilst residues 54 to 58, the small loop (Backes et al., 1991), contains the ®nal

cluster ligand, Cys54. Both Phe25 and Ala34, having been brought close to the cluster by the tertiary fold of the protein, are described as remote residues. Generally the residues in the large loop are better de®ned than the residues in the small loop (Figure 9 and Table 4). Residues which are ordered and contain no subfamilies within the 19 structures include residues 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 25 and 34. Ala13 is poorly de®ned with no preferred orientation Ê dominating its conformation (0.64 A global backbone displacement). Surprisingly, two subfamilies are observed for Cys14: in 5 of the 19 structures the amide hydrogen points away from the cluster

695 comparison of the two structures for a Fe4S4 ferredoxin has not previously been reported and is therefore of interest. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, two molecules are found in the asymmetric unit cell of the crystal, Mol I and Mol II, which Â form a close packing interaction (Sery et al., 1994). By direct comparison of this region with the solution structure any possible distortions of the crystal structure caused by this packing interaction can be assessed. Â In the paper by Sery et al. (1994) reporting the X-ray structure, the backbone r.m.s.d. values of the Ê two molecules of 0.24 A for residues 4 to 62 and the very similar fold of the structures determined from the pattern of hydrogen bonds permitted the authors to state that within experimental error the molecules were equivalent. The detailed analysis within their paper was then restricted to Mol I only. However, for the purpose of our comparison we have utilised both of the X-ray structures, although in reporting statistical analysis and visual representations a mean molecule of the two X-ray structures generated in MOLMOL has sometimes been used for simplicity (see Figure legends). Similarly, the mean of the family of 19 solution structures has been used, though we acknowledge that the use of average structures is not ideal. Therefore, particular care has been taken when considering regions of potential structural differences to establish whether deviations intrinsic to the X-ray structures and/or those to the family of solution structures occur. Poor de®nition in the NMR structure can be assessed from the r.m.s.d. values determined over the family of 19 structures and when large r.m.s.d. values are seen within the NMR structures the identi®cation of real structural differences between the NMR and X-ray structures becomes ambiguous. For identi®cation of illde®ned regions in the X-ray structures we are reliant on the details reported in the X-ray paper. Regions described as ill-de®ned in both molecules of the X-ray structure were the two C-terminal residues, residues 28 to 33, and the side-chain of Glu45. Additionally for Mol II, the N-terminal residue was included in this category. Also, because the N and C termini have higher than average r.m.s.d. values in the NMR structures and show poor convergence in the X-ray structures (the backbone r.m.s.d. value for residues 1 to 64 of the X-ray Ê Ê structures is 0.96 A compared with 0.24 A for residues 4 to 62) all comparisons have been con®ned to residues 4 to 62. An overlay of the backbone of the mean solution structure of ferredoxin I with the mean X-ray structure and the complementary statistical analysis are given in Figure 10. The global backbone and heavy-atom r.m.s.d. values for residues 4 to 62 in Ê Ê Figure 10 are 1.18 A and 1.83 A, respectively. Although these are larger than the r.m.s.d. values reported within the family of 19 structures there is an obvious correlation between the overall fold of the protein in both the solution and solid state structures. This is complemented by the absolute

in contrast to the dominant subfamily of 14 where the amide hydrogen is directed towards the cluster. This latter orientation is characteristic of the CysII site in other ferredoxins (Adman et al., 1976; Fukayama et al., 1988; Backes et al., 1991; Donaire et al., 1994, 1996; Gorst et al., 1995) and is consistent with the observation of the aCH resonance of Cys14 in 1D NOE data of ferredoxin I (Davy et al., 1995). The poor de®nition of the remaining residue in the large loop, Glu15 (heavy-atoms only), and residues of the small loop, is accounted for by the absence, or the small number, of experimental constraints obtained for them (Figure 7). The relationship between the lack of NMR data and the in¯uence of the paramagnetism is established by examination of the tertiary structure. For instance, the full spin system of Pro55 was not observed, and the dCH hydrogen atoms of Pro55 were consistently found at a distance from Fe4 ranging Ê from 4.0 to 4.8 A. However, for Cys58, which shows the second largest global backbone displacement behind Ala13 (Table 4), the situation is more Ê complex. This displacement value of 0.56 A is not simply a re¯ection of poor convergence over the whole family of 19 NMR structures as two subfamilies were identi®ed for this residue: in six of the structures the NH hydrogen of Cys58 points away from the cluster and the cysteinyl ligating gS of Cys54 (see below), whilst in the remaining 13 its direction is reversed and lies towards the cluster. This bias in 13 of the 19 structures towards one orientation allows us to predict that this is the more favourable orientation. The ®nal two residues within the cluster environment are the remote residues of Phe25 and Ala34. The backbone of Phe25 is well-de®ned in the family of 19 structures, and with the exception of one structure (structure 11), the orientation of the ring of Phe25 is also consistent throughout the solution structures. Good de®nition of this residue was expected from the large number of its experimental constraints (Figure 7(b)). The de®nition of the second remote residue of the cluster environment, Ala34, is also good, both when the full structures are overlaid (Figure 7(a)), and particularly when the overlay is optimised for the cluster environment (Figure 9 and Table 4). The general orientation of this residue is consistent throughout the ®nal family of 19 structures, with the methyl group and aCH hydrogen of this residue within the paramagnetic environment of three of the cluster Fe atoms (Fe1, Fe2, and Fe3). The amide hydrogen itself points towards the gS of the cluster-ligating Cys11 residue (see below).

Figure 10. (a) Overlay of the backbones of the mean solution structure (red) and the mean X-ray structure (black). Both structures and the overlay were constructed using the program MOLMOL. The solution structure was determined from the NMR family of 19 structures, the X-ray structure from the two molecules (Mol I and Mol II) found in the asymmetric unit cell. The overlay is optimised for residues 4 to 62 (residues 1 to 3 and 63 to 64 are not shown), Ê Ê with a global backbone r.m.s.d. value of 1.18 A and a global heavy atom r.m.s.d. of 1.83 A. The similarity in the overall folds of the protein structures can be seen clearly. (b) Sausage diagram of the overlay given in (a). The width of the sausage and the colour is representative of the convergence between the structures. Areas in yellow are residues with a lower than average global backbone r.m.s.d. value, orange de®nes residues with r.m.s.d. values ranging Ê Ê between 1.19 A and 1.55 A.

These regions are exempli®ed by residues 8 to 9 (left of the cluster), and the loop to the extreme left of the overlay involving residues 29 to 31. Blue indicates residues 1 to 3, 63 and 64. Structural differences are discussed in the text. (c) Distribution of the backbone (®lled circles) and heavy-atom (open circles) r.m.s.d. data for individual residues for the overlay in (a).

conservation of the secondary structure elements. Those listed in the X-ray paper were limited to Mol I as follows: two a-helices (residues 16 to 20 and 44 to 53), two double-stranded sheets (residues 3 to 6 and residues 59 to 62; residues 25 to 28 and residues 33 to 36) and ®ve turns (residues 8 to 10, 22 to 24, 29 to 32, 39 to 40 and 55 to 56). These are represented on the sequence of ferredoxin I (Figure 11) together with the analogous data for Mol II, determined with MOLMOL, and the secondary structure elements de®ned for the solution structure in Figure 8. The agreement is excellent between these structures, which all show the topology associated with mono-cluster ferredoxins (Fukayama et al., 1988; Kissinger et al., 1991; Cammack, 1992; Matsubara & Saeki, 1992; Donaire et al., 1996). Although some regions (19-20, 36-37, 40 to 42) and lone residues (13, 15, and 23) exhibit backbone r.m.s.d. values greater than the global mean of Ê 1.18 A there are only two regions within the structure of ferredoxin I which show substantial structural deviations: residues 8 to 10 and residues 29 to 32 (Figure 10). In the family of solution structures the backbone of the loop region incorporating residues 29 to 32 is well-de®ned, whilst in both of the X-ray structures it is listed as an ill-de®ned region. It seems likely that there is a real difference between the reported D. africanus ferredoxin I structures in this loop region, though we cannot state whether this difference is a re¯ection of the structure in the different media or is a consequence of the poor diffraction data in the X-ray study. The second region identi®ed as showing poor convergence between the NMR and X-ray struc-

tures involves residues 8 to 10. In both the NMR determined structure and the X-ray structure the same motif, a turn, has been identi®ed for these residues (see Figure 11). However, in the NMR family of structures this region is not well de®ned, and therefore the differences between the NMR and X-ray structures for this region probably represent variability within the NMR family of structures and not real differences between the crystal and solution state structures. The interacting interface seen in the X-ray structure of ferredoxin I involves residues 38, 40 to 43 and 46 in a network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The residues of 41 to 43 show slightly larger than average backbone r.m.s.d. values between the X-ray and NMR structures, but the 39 to 42 turn showed inadequate convergence to be considered well-de®ned in the solution structure. Residues 38 and 46 are well-de®ned in the solution structure and these show good convergence with the corresponding residues in the X-ray structure. With the exception of residue 40, none of the aforementioned residues has a larger global heavy-atom Ê r.m.s.d. value greater than the average of 1.83 A (Figure 10(c)). Thus, even though the global r.m.s.d. values between the solution structure and crystal structure are relatively high, the fact that residues 38, 42± 43 and 46 show values comparable with other regions of the protein indicates that there is not a major difference in the interface regions between the various structures. In the solution structure of ferredoxin I, 15 residues were identi®ed with at least one hydrogen Ê atom within the cluster environment (<5.00 A radius from a cluster Fe atom). Comparison of the

Figure 11. Comparison of the secondary structure of ferredoxin I observed in the solution structure and crystal structure. The elements given for the solution structure were determined from all 19 structures, both the X-ray molecules are listed. This analysis was performed in MOLMOL. The correlation between the secondary structures is striking and the conservation of turns also ensures the tertiary fold of the protein structures are very similar.

similar data for the two X-ray structures identi®es 14 of these residues together with an additional two: Val6 and Ile59. The gCH3 hydrogen atoms of Ê Val6 are $4.5 A from Fe1 and Fe4, and the sidechain orientation of Ile59 is such that its dCH and Ê gCH hydrogen atoms are within a 3.4 to 4.8 A range of Fe4. Of the other residues close to the cluster in the NMR structure (11 to 18, 25, 34, 54 to 58) it is only the side-chain of Phe25 which is at a Ê distance >5.00 A from the cluster in the X-ray structure. A visual comparison of the cluster environments in the two structures is given in Figure 12: in (a) the residues of the large ligating loop (residues 11 to 18), the small loop (residues 54 to 58) and the remote residue of Ala34 are superimposed for the mean NMR structure (red) and the two X-ray structures (black); in (b) the additional residues of Phe25, Met27 and Ile59 are included. Overlaying of these residues optimises the comparison of the cluster environments: the global backbone and heavy-atom r.m.s.d. values are Ê Ê Ê 0.69 A and 1.33 A for X-ray Mol I and 0.66 A and Ê 1.09 A for X-ray Mol II. This indicates that the cluster environments are similar. Comparison of the cluster environments allows further clari®cation of the orientations of two residues which had subfamilies in the NMR structure, Cys14 and Cys58. As a cluster ligand and `additional' cysteine, respectively, the orientation of these residues is of particular interest. The dominant solution subfamilies of both residues is consistent with the X-ray structure, i.e. the amide hydrogen of Cys14 is directed towards the cluster, and the amide hydrogen of Cys58 is directed towards the gS of Cys54. Calculation of a mean structure from the 13 structures which show this particular orientation of Cys58, and overlaying the cluster environment of this

with the X-ray structures shows a decrease in the average backbone and heavy-atom r.m.s.d. of this Ê Ê residue from 0.57 A and 0.88 A (mean of all 19 Ê Ê structures) to 0.45 A and 0.86 A. Thus, Cys58 appears to be in close contact with the cluster (S1) and one of its ligands (Cys54) in solution, as in the X-ray structure of ferredoxin I. The overlay of these 13 structures with the X-ray structures given in Figure 12(b) clearly illustrates the differences in the positions of Phe25 and Ile59. The presence of aromatic residues close to the cluster have been observed in other Fe4S4 cluster proteins (e.g. see Adman et al., 1973; Carter et al., 1974; Krishnamoorthi et al., 1986; Fukuyama et al., 1989; Banci et al., 1994b, 1995; Donaire et al., 1994; Bertini et al., 1996b) but the ring of Phe25 in our NMR structure is closer to the cluster than in the crystal structure of ferredoxin I. The position of the backbone of Phe25 is similar in the solution and crystal structures, with the hydrogen bond between the amide of Phe25 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ala21 observed in both. Therefore, it is only the side-chain of Phe25 which is differently positioned (Figure 12(b)). This is well-de®ned in the solution structures where its position has been de®ned by 19 interresidue NOEs to a better than average precision as given by the relevant r.m.s.d. values (Figure 7(a)). The proximity of an Ile in the cluster environment has been reported in other ferredoxin structures (Fukuyama et al., 1989). A 1D NOE was observed between the bCH hydrogen of Cys54 with one of the hydrogen resonances of Ile59 but the full spin system of Ile59 remains unidenti®ed. Collectively, the qualitative information indicates the close proximity of Ile59 to the cluster but the lack of observable NOEs means there is little quan-

Figure 12. Stereo views permitting a comparison of the cluster environments of the solution structures and crystal structures of D. africanus ferredoxin I. (a) Residues common to the cluster environment of both structures are overlaid for the two crystal structures (black) and the average of the 19 NMR structures (red). The residues are 11 to 18 (large loop), 54 to 58 (small loop) and Ala34 (remote residue). The orientation chosen is in accordance with Figure 9. (b) Overlay of 13 NMR structures (see the text) and the two X-ray molecules (black). Residues in red are those shown in (a) and residues in green are Phe25, Met27 and Ile59 of the NMR structures. The different orientations of Phe25 and Ile59 clearly determines that Phe25 is only in the cluster environment of the solution structure and Ile59 is only in the cluster environment of the crystal structure.

titative NMR data to positively de®ne the actual orientation of this residue in the solution structure. One further residue has been included in Figure 12(b), Met27, because, like Phe25 and Ile59, this forms part of the shield protecting the cluster Â from the bulk solvent (Sery et al., 1994). In the solution structure the side-chain of Met27 is not well-de®ned, although its backbone is. Figure 10 shows that when the NMR and X-ray mean structures are overlaid for residues 4 to 62, the backÊ bone r.m.s.d. for Met27 is only 0.83 A, and even when the overlay is optimised for the cluster and its ligands the position of the backbone of Met27 is similar in both structures. The difference in the side-chain orientations leads to Met27 in the solution structure being closer to the cluster than it is in the X-ray structures (Figure 12(b)). Collectively Met27, Phe25, and Ile59 shield the cluster from the solvent and although there are differences in the positions of these residues between the solution and crystal structures, these differences are relatively small and the groups

occupy similar regions of space in both structures. However, the differences raise the question of whether there are real differences between the solution and X-ray structures in the vicinity of the cluster, or whether they are a re¯ection of the inherent problem in determining the structure of a paramagnetic system by NMR. As far as Ile59 and Met27 are concerned, the difference could result from a lack of quantitative NOEs but for Phe25 this is unlikely to be the case. Cluster NHÐS hydrogen bonds A characteristic associated with Fe4S4 clusters and its ligands are interactions with other groups through a network of hydrogen bonds of the type NHÐS. The amide hydrogen atoms are donated by residues in the cluster environment and the S is a cluster sulphide or a gS atom of a cysteinyl ligand. For Fe4S4 ferredoxins it has been established that eight hydrogen bonds are generally formed, ®ve from the large loop, two from the

699 the (NH)3 group is the amide of CysIII. The ®rst X in the small loop is the fourth remote cysteine ligand; CysIV. A schematic representation of these hydrogen bond interactions is given in Figure 13 with the residue numbering for D. africanus ferredoxin I. To identify hydrogen bonds in the family of NMR structures, the distances and linearity of NHÐS vectors were considered in accordance with the analysis of Donohue (1969). This established that the NÐS distance on its own is an inadequate criterion for recognition of a hydrogen bond. Sulphur and amide hydrogen atoms were considered to form hydrogen bonds if the NÐS Ê distance ranged between 3.25 and 3.55 A, the HÐS Ê , and there was a distance between 2.3 and 2.6 A deviation from linearity of the H-NÐS vector of less than 25 . All contacts between amide hydrogen and sulphur atoms, both cysteinyl and cluster sulphide, were analysed for each of the 19 solution structures of ferredoxin I and four interactions were found that satis®ed both the distance and angular criteria speci®ed above: gS11-NH34, gS14NH16, S2-NH12, S4-NH17 (Table 5). All these residues are de®ned with precision in the cluster environment. Also listed in Table 5 is a proposed hydrogen bond between gS54 and NH58, which, unlike the other four proposed hydrogen bonds, is not present in all 19 structures because Cys58 has two subfamilies, as stated earlier. In the dominant subfamily of 13 out of 19 structures, the orientation of the NH hydrogen of Cys58 towards the gS atom of Cys54 allows both the distance and angle criteria for an NHÐS hydrogen bond to be satis®ed in nine of the structures. The presence of the amide hydrogen of Cys58 in spectra of a 99.9% 2H2O sample (Figure 3) supports its involvement in a hydrogen bond. Close contact between the gS of Cys54 with the NH of Gln57 indicates that a poten-

Possible hydrogen bonds identi®ed by the sole criteria of the NÐS distance. Donohue established that a strong NHÐS hydrogen bond needs to satisfy the following distance and angular criteria; NÐS, Ê Ê 3.25-3.55 A; HÐS, 2.3-2.6 A; H-NÐS angle 180(Æ25) . c See Figure 13. d The numbering of the inorganic sulphur atoms of the cluster has been modi®ed in accordance with the numbering used in the solution structure. S3 is equivalent to S1 and S2 is equivalent to the S3 in the original X-ray paper. e Due to two subfamilies observed for Cys58 this hydrogen bond is not seen in all of the solution structures (see the text).

700 tial hydrogen bond between these residues may be Ê present with an average NÐS distance of 3.25 A Ê and HÐS distance of 2.60 A. However, the Donohue (1969) criterion for deviation from linearity is violated with an average deviation of $40 . Thus only ®ve out of the expected eight NHÐS hydrogen bonds have been found in the NMR structures of D. africanus ferredoxin I. The missing H-bonds are two from the large loop and one from the small loop: gS11-NH13, S3-NH15 and gS54NH56, respectively. In the X-ray structure paper, NHÐS hydrogen bonds were identi®ed from the NÐS distances only. Based on this criterion 11 such interactions were identi®ed, seven between backbone amides and the gS atoms of the cluster ligands and four to Â the sulphides of the cluster (Sery et al., 1994). However, using the additional parameters of the Ê HÐS distances (<2.6 A) and the linearity of the H-NÐS vector (180(Æ25) ) only seven of the 11 NÐS interactions listed in the X-ray study are consistent with hydrogen bonds (Table 5). Five of these are those seen in the solution structures (Table 5). The gS54-NH56 hydrogen bond expected for a Fe4S4 cluster is not seen in either the X-ray structures or NMR structures. Though distance and angle criteria are good indicators of hydrogen bond interactions, the rate of exchange of the hydrogen-bonded hydrogen for solvent deuterons is generally an excellent additional indicator. A relatively slow rate of exchange is consistent with a hydrogen bond, though rapid exchange does not mean a hydrogen bond is not formed. However, a problem with the proposed NHÐS hydrogen bonds in ferredoxin is that the amide hydrogen atoms are close enough to the cluster to experience sizable paramagnetic perturbations, and perhaps even to have some unpaired electron density delocalised onto them. This renders their observation dif®cult, and in the present case the amide hydrogen atoms of Ile12, Ala13, Ser16, Cys17, Ala34 and Val56, all potential hydrogen bond donors to the cluster (Table 5), remain unassigned. The amide hydrogen atoms of Glu15, expected to form a cluster hydrogen bond and probably doing so in the X-ray structures Â (Table 5), Gln57, proposed by Sery et al. (1994) to form a cluster hydrogen bond, and Cys58, expected to form a cluster hydrogen bond and probably doing so in the NMR structures (Table 5) are all assigned. With the exception of Cys58 the amide NH hydrogen atoms of these residues exchange rapidly with solvent deuterons (Figure 3). If a relationship can be established between the rate of exchange for amide hydrogen atoms and their involvement in hydrogen bonds in the cluster environment, then direct measurement of exchange data could provide additional structural constraints. Such data were utilised in the study of the 2 Â Fe4S4 ferredoxin from C. pasteurianum by Bertini et al. (1995a), where, having observed a retarded rate of amide hydrogen exchange for one residue expected to hydrogen bond to each cluster,

Structure of Oxidised D. africanus Ferredoxin I

appropriate constraints were included in the structure calculations. Amide hydrogen atoms of other potential hydrogen bonding groups were not assigned. Dynamic characteristics of the cluster environment There are two pieces of data from our study of D. africanus ferredoxin I and similar data from other studies of ferredoxins that indicate that the environment of the cluster is relatively dynamic. The ®rst is the observation of the ring of Phe25 as an A2M2X spin system, which indicates that this residue ¯ips rapidly between equivalent positions È about its Cb ± Cg bond (Wuthrich, 1986). In other proteins aromatic rings packed close to large prosthetic groups frequently have retarded rates of conformational ¯ipping; e.g. eukaryotic cytochromes c (Campbell et al., 1976). The second piece of information is that NH hydrogen atoms of groups close to the cluster, including at least one which probably forms an NHÐS hydrogen bond, S3-NH15 (Table 5), rapidly exchange with solvent. The comparison with HiPIPs is striking. In E. halophila HiPIP a retarded rate of conformational ¯ipping has been reported for the ring of Tyr14 which is close to the cluster (Bertini et al., 1996b), and NH hydrogen atoms which are hydrogenbonded to cluster S atoms generally have slow exchange rates. Indeed, Orme-Johnson et al. (1983) and Backes et al. (1991) report, from electron spinecho and resonance Raman studies, that it is necessary to partially denature HiPIPs to achieve complete exchange of NH groups hydrogenbonded to the cluster, whereas signi®cant exchange is seen in ferredoxins without denaturation. One implication of these observations is that in analysing the factors which in¯uence the redox potentials of ferredoxins, the dynamic characteristics of the cluster environment need to be considered. The importance of the polarity of the environments of Fe/S clusters in in¯uencing the levels of the reduction potentials has been recognised for some time (Kassner & Yang, 1977), and con®rmed by more recent theoretical studies (Jensen et al., 1994; Mouesca et al., 1994). Should the dynamic nature of the cluster environment cause sizable timedependent changes in polarity on a time-scale similar to that for electron transfer, then the thermodynamic, and hence kinetic, parameters of the electron transfer step might be modulated. Further experimental and theoretical study of the dynamics of Fe/S proteins are needed to address this issue.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of NMR samples Oxidised D. africanus ferredoxin I was prepared by the method of Hatchikian et al. (1979). Samples for NMR were 4 to 6 mM in >99% 2H2O or in 90% H2O/10%

Structure of Oxidised D. africanus Ferredoxin I H2O, and in 5 mM or 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer at either pH 7.2 or pH 6.1. Quoted pH values are direct meter readings uncorrected for any isotope effect. An Amicon 8MC ultra-centrifugation unit equipped with a micro-volume insert and a YM3 membrane was used for solvent exchange. NMR spectroscopy Spectra were recorded on JEOL GX-400 and a500 spectrometers, Bruker AMX500 and AMX600 spectrometers and a Varian Unity Inova 600 spectrometer. A range of spectrometers was required because during much of the life-time of this work local facilities were not adequate for the task. Consequently we obtained spectra from external laboratories where time was available. Spectra recorded on the Bruker spectrometers were acquired in the pure absorption mode with the TPPI È method (Red®eld & Kunz, 1975; Marion & Wuthrich, 1983). On the Varian 600 and JEOL spectrometers spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-TPPI procedure (Marion et al., 1989) or hypercomplex method of States et al. (1982). COSY, DQF-COSY, TOCSY and NOESY spectra were obtained by standard È procedures (Bax et al., 1985; Frenkiel, 1993; Wuthrich, 1986). For TOCSY experiments spin-lock ®elds were obtained with an MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence (Bax & Davies, 1985). A spin-lock ®eld of 10 to 12 MHz was used for mixing times ranging from 50 to 200 ms. The ®eld was increased to 15 to 20 MHz, and the mixing time decreased to between 5 and 25 ms, for TOCSY spectra acquired to observe correlations between the fast relaxing hydrogen atoms of the cluster ligands (Sadek et al., 1993; Osborne et al., 1997). NOESY spectra recorded for observation of dipolar correlations in the diamagnetic regions of the protein were recorded with mixing times ranging from 30 to 200 ms. For observation of NOESY effects at 600 MHz involving rapidly relaxing nuclei, mixing times of 5 to 10 ms were used (Bertini et al., 1991; Banci et al., 1994a). Additional NOE data for these nuclei were obtained from 600 MHz 1D-NOE difference spectra collected as previously described (Banci et al., 1994a; Davy et al., 1995). Typical data set sizes for 2D homonuclear experiments were 512 increments of 1000 or 2000 data points. Resolution enhancement was achieved by zero-®lling to give a processed matrix of 2000 Â 2000 data points or 4000 Â 4000 data points. Prior to Fourier-transformation either a sine-bell squared (1/3 phase shift) or a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian window function was applied in both F2 and F1 dimensions. Chemical shifts were measured from the HO2H peak at 4.75 ppm (25 C) and are quoted relative to the methyl resonance of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapropanesulphonic acid at 0 ppm. The NMR data were processed with FELIX (Hare and BIOSYM) and analysed with this program and also with XEASY (Eccles et al., 1991) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 4000 workstation. Structural constraints A total of 588 unique NOEs were assigned from 1472 correlations observed from a 150 ms NOESY spectrum recorded at 500 MHz. The assignment of an additional 180 NOEs, predominately from ®ve shorter mixing time NOESY experiments (30 ms to 100 ms), raised the total number of assigned NOEs to 768.

The intensity of the assigned NOEs in the 2D data sets were quanti®ed using an integration routine running within the program XEASY (Eccles et al., 1991). Each peak was individually integrated utilising the manual mode having de®ned an elliptical peak line shape. The base level, used to eradicate the introduction of errors due to the incorporation of noise into the integral, was determined for each spectrum. When degenerate peaks were observed the total peak volume was divided proportionately (i.e. in half for two peaks, in thirds for three peaks, etc.) or the peak left unassigned. Upper limits of interhydrogen distances were generated for each spectrum from this list of assigned peak integrals using the È È program CALIBA (Guntert et al., 1991; Guntert, 1995). Scaling of the NOEs from the different spectra was achieved with the weighting procedure available within CALIBA. Initially peaks were calibrated with plots of cross-peak volumes versus distances for rigid structures. These included intraresidue correlations involving the indole hydrogen of Trp61 and interresidue dNN(i,i  1) correlations observed for the a-helical residues Gln44 to Thr53. Following the initial calculations, the different classes of NOEs given in Table 1 were continually recalibrated on successive cycles of the structure calculations È as described by Guntert et al. (1991). The best agreement between dipolar connectivities was obtained when the intensities were given a 1/r6 dependence for the hydrogen distances of the long-range backbone and mediumrange NOEs, and a 1/r4 dependence for all other classes. Eighteen connectivities observed in 1D NOE difference spectra were also incorporated into the upper distance limit ®le with the interhydrogen distances originally Ê ®xed at 4 A. The number of experimentally determined interhydrogen distances in the original upper limit ®le therefore totalled 786. For the structure calculations performed with È DIANA (Guntert et al., 1991) the Fe4S4 cluster motif was constructed by modi®cation of the ligating cysteine residues to the arti®cial amino acid CFS as described by Banci et al. (1994a). The appropriate 26 links used to de®ne the cluster were speci®ed as `special covalent bonds' (scb's) in the upper and lower È limit ®les (Guntert, 1995). In addition to the distance constraints determined experimentally from the 2D and 1D NOE data, and scbs used to demarcate the cluster, further structural constraints were identi®ed after the generation of a ®rst family of DG structures (calculation I). Examination of these structures led to the identi®cation of hydrogen bonds and also indicated the necessity for the inclusion of some lower limit constraints. These were utilised in a second DIANA calculation (calculation II). Unambiguous assignments of hydrogen bonds were made from NH exchange data and the observation of consistent potential hydrogen bonds in initial structures: 19 consistent hydroÊ gen bonds with an HÐO interatomic distance of <2.4 A and angular deviation of the donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle of Æ35 were identi®ed. These hydrogen bonds were de®ned within the upper distance limit ®le by the Ê inclusion of OÐH and OÐN distances of 2.4 A and Ê 3.0 A, respectively. The additional lower limit constraints included in the second series of DIANA calculations were for residues Pro29 to Glu32. These residues consistently showed van der Waals distance violations in calculation I with distances much shorter than the upper distance limit determined from integration of the NOESY data. Four lower limit constraints were included for sequential or medium

702
range NOEs assigned for residues Asp28 to Lys33 inclusive. The ®nal set of NMR data introduced into the input constraints for the second DIANA calculation were the Ca-Cb-Sg-Fe dihedral angles previously determined from NMR parameters (Davy et al., 1995), i.e. 75 , 315 , 245 and 80 for Cys11, Cys14, Cys17 and Cys54, respectively. Structure determination The solution structure of D. africanus ferredoxin I was calculated using a combined procedure of distance geometry followed by simulated annealing and restrained molecular dynamics. Distance geometry structure calculations were carried out with DIANA (version 2.1) and È its auxiliary programs (Guntert et al., 1991). Re®nement of the distance geometry structures was performed with È X-PLOR (version 3.843: Brunger, 1992). For the DG calculations the recommended redundant È dihedral angle constraints strategy (REDAC: Guntert & È Wuthrich, 1991) was used throughout. In these calculations, the side-chains of the eight glutamate, three aspartate and three lysine residues, His60 and Arg2 were all assumed to be charged. In each cycle of the calculations the standard DIANA minimisation parameters were used, with the maximum number of target function evaluations set to 2000. The minimisation for a level was stopped after 200 evaluations if the target function was not being reduced by 1% or more. Two DIANA calculations were performed, calculation I and calculation II, which differed in their initial experimental input restraints. Additional constraints were utilised for calculation II based on examination of the family of structures from calculation I and the original NMR data as described above. The input constraints for DIANA calculation I were upper and lower distance limits. The lower limit ®le contained only the 26 scbs used to de®ne the cluster. The upper distance limit ®le contained 812 distance constraints, 786 derived from experimental data and the 26 scbs used to de®ne the Fe4S4 cluster. The initial cycle of calculation I was run with 50 start conformers of randomised dihedral angles minimised against the experimental distance constraints. The original upper distance constraints ®le was modi®ed in the ®rst cycle of the calculation, with the automatic elimination of 237 irrelevant constraints; 211 of these restraints could not be violated in any conformation of the polypeptide chain and 26 distances were de®ned as ®xed hydrogen ± hydrogen distances. The remaining 575 relevant distances provided the distance constraints for all subsequent cycles of DIANA calculations. In Table 1 these are divided into the ®ve classes of connectivities de®ned by CALIBA. This ®rst cycle of the calculation generated the redundant dihedral angle constraints which provided constraints for the next cycle of the DIANA calculation in accordance with the REDAC strategy. The dihedral angle constraints were accepted if the Ê local target function was smaller than 0.5 A2 for at least ten of the structures generated in the calculation. This REDAC procedure was repeated three more times and È after each cycle the program GLOMSA (Guntert et al., 1991) was used to aid stereo-speci®c assignments for geminal hydrogen atoms and methyl groups. Including the four stereo-speci®c assignments of the bCH2 protons of the cluster ligands determined previously from 1D experiments (Davy et al., 1995), a total of 44 stereospeci®c assignments were made. Pseudo-atoms were used to designate non stereo-speci®cally assigned hydro-

Structure of Oxidised D. africanus Ferredoxin I gen atoms and degenerate methylene hydrogen atoms. During the REDAC cycles the number of conformers was decreased from 50 to 30 to aid the structural convergence. The 30 structures were chosen based on their target function value and by analysis of violated constraints. Structures with no common NOE-derived disÊ tance constraints greater than 0.5 A and no common torsion angle violation greater than 5 were taken into the ®fth and ®nal calculation to generate the ®rst DG family of 30 structures. This ®nal DIANA minimisation calculation was performed against the distance constraints and the conformers generated from the preceding REDAC calculation. The basic format of DIANA calculation II was similar to that of calculation I, although the number of conformers generated from the experimental constraints in the ®rst cycle was increased from 50 to 75. The upper and lower limit distance ®les used in this cycle had been modi®ed as described above. Following the initial cycle of calculation II, three further REDAC cycles were performed. The number of conformers used in these cycles was reduced successively from 75 to 40 (for two cycles), then to 30. These 30 conformers, chosen with the same criteria as stated above for calculation I, were used in the ®nal DIANA calculation minimised against the experimental constraints as before. The family of 30 structures from this calculation provided the input structures for re®nement using the simulated annealing and energy minimisation protocols of X-PLOR (version 3.843: È Brunger, 1992). The DIANA co-ordinate ®les were converted into PDB format using the program COFIMA. However, to use X-PLOR, amendments to the nomenclature were needed and for ferredoxin I these included the rede®nition of the cluster as a prosthetic group and the speci®cation of its topology and parameters. Thus, the CFS residues were modi®ed back to Cys residues with the Fe and S atoms of each CFS residue added as an extra residue at the end of the structure co-ordinate ®le. For generation of the X-PLOR molecular structure ®le the generatemetal procedure, which includes default topology and parameters for an Fe4S4 cluster, was used. Although the default masses of the Fe and S atoms were used, distances and angles for the internal cluster geometry, and between the cysteinyl ligands and the cluster speci®c to ferredoxin I, were de®ned. Each Fe and S atom was designated a distinct atom type and a total of 20 bonds and 48 bond angles (12 and 24 intrinsic to the cluster, respectively) were speci®ed. The values were determined from analysis of the 30 DG structures using QUANTA (Molecular Simulations). The average distances and angles for the 30 DG structures were taken and these parameters were used in all the subsequent X-PLOR calculations. For all the other residues the topology ®le topallhdg old.pro and the parameter ®le parallhdg old.pro were used. Due to errors encountered at a later stage for dihedral angles involving proline residues, the atom types of the gC and dC atoms were modi®ed from CT to CP, in accordance with the later X-PLOR version of 3.851. This procedure eradicated the angular violations by enabling speci®c proline angles to be de®ned separately from equivalent angles in other residues. The resulting topology ®le was used throughout all the stages of the X-PLOR calculations. Thirty X-PLOR protein structure ®les and co-ordinate ®les were generated from the 30 DIANA structures by the generatemetal protocol inclusive of the modi®cations detailed above. For the ®rst X-PLOR re®nement the distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol was used. The exper-

Structure of Oxidised D. africanus Ferredoxin I imental constraints were the NOE-derived distances and the four Ca-Cb-Sg-Fe dihedral angles. Violations of both Ê the geometric experimental constraints (NOE <0.5 A, dihedral angles <5 ) and the integral X-PLOR parameters were determined for each individual structure and the structures assessed with the accept protocol. No NOE violations were observed, although small deviations in some of the dihedral angles resulted in two out of the 30 structures being rejected. The remaining 28 structures were re®ned using slow-cooling simulated annealing (initial temperature of 2000 K, 8000 cooling steps: Ê È Brunger, 1992). With no violations (NOE <0.5 A, diheÊ dral angles <5 , bond distances <0.05 A, bond angles <5 , improper angles <5 ) all these structures were accepted. In a second cycle of simulated annealing re®nement, further restrictions were applied to the cluster ligands and the cluster itself, ®xing these groups (Table 1). In the resulting 28 structures no geometric constraints were violated. Upon further applications of the re®nement protocol no signi®cant improvement in the calculated structures was observed. Nineteen of the 28 structures with the lowest overall energies were chosen for calculation of the average structure and for further detailed structural analysis. The average structure was subjected to a ®nal simulated annealing re®nement followed by an additional 2000 cycles of Powell restrained energy minimisation (KNOE  110 kcal molÀ1, KCDIH  200 kcal molÀ1). The empirical quality of the calculated structures was assessed using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al., 1996), MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) and X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992). The co-ordinates of the ®nal 19 NMR structures and the average minimised structure together with the NMR constraints have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 1dfd, 1dax and r1dfdmr, respectively.
