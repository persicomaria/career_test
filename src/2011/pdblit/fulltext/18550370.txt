Abstract--In the search of Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors structurally different from the pyrazole-based series, we identified a viable series of enantiopure cis-(1R,2S)-cycloalkyldiamine derivatives as potent and selective inhibitors of FXa. Among them, cyclohexyldiamide 7 and cyclopentyldiamide 9 were the most potent neutral compounds, and had good anticoagulant activity comparable to the pyrazole-based analogs. Crystal structures of 7-FXa and 9-FXa illustrate binding similarities and differences between the fiveand the six-membered core systems, and provide rationales for the observed SAR of P1 and linker moieties.

Coagulation factor Xa (FXa), a serine protease positioned at the convergence of the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways in the coagulation cascade, is an attractive target for developing novel, orally active anticoagulants for the treatment and prevention of thrombotic diseases. Selective FXa inhibitors might be more efficacious, have fewer bleeding risks, and a more favorable safety/efficacy ratio compared with thrombin inhibitors.1­3 Several small-molecule, orally active FXa inhibitors, including pyrazole-based razaxaban4 and apixaban,5 have entered clinical development, and apixaban is undergoing evaluation in phase 3 studies in various indications. During the search for diverse scaffolds for FXa inhibition, compound 1 (Table 1) was identified as a lead bearing a simple ethylene diamine core with a N-phenylpyridone P4 group. The phenylpyridone group, as the unsaturated derivative of the phenylpiperidinone group found in apixaban,5 was a potent P4 moiety in the pyrazole-based series.6 Compound 1 showed good in vitro

Figure 1 depicts the X-ray structure of the 1-FXa com° plex with R = 0.24 at 1.8 A resolution.7 In this complex, 1 adopts an L-shaped conformation, similar to that observed in the pyrazole-based analogs previously disclosed,4,5 with the chlorothiophene group occupying the S1 pocket and the phenylpyridone group bound to the S4 pocket. The P1 amide is coplanar with the thiophene ring, while the P4 amide is slightly tilted from the phenyl ring.

Purified human enzymes were used. Values were averages from multiple determinations (n P 2). Ki values were measured as described in Ref. 10. PT EC2x (the concentration of the inhibitor that doubles the prothrombin time from the control) values were measured according to Ref. 4. Same for all tables.

Figure 1. Interactions between compound 1 and the FXa active site. There is a water-mediated hydrogen-bond system involving the P1 carbonyl and Ser214 O. The P1 amide NH forms a hydrogen bond with Gly218 O, and the P4 amide NH forms a tight hydrogen bond with Gly216 O. The P1 Cl substituent forms a close contact with Tyr228 side chain.

S1 and S4 pockets are well-defined and distinctive subsites of FXa. Based on experience, we believe that interactions of a ligand in the FXa S1 and S4 subsites are essential to the FXa binding affinity of the ligand. The proper orientation of the P1 and P4 groups toward the S1 and S4 pockets could be achieved by the selection of an appropriate core or linker. The well-defined electron density of the flexible ethylene linker in the crystal structure of the 1-FXa complex (Fig. 2) led us to the strategy of improving FXa binding affinity by adding one or more methyl groups on the ethylene linker to further stabilize the observed gauche conformation. The potency of the resulting methylated ethylenediamides is shown in Table 1. Adding methyl group(s) at either the C1 or the C2 position of the ethylene chain in 1 with

a 5-chlorothiophene P1 group (A) resulted in compounds having similar FXa inhibitory activity. In contrast, adding methyl group(s) in 2 bearing a larger bicyclic 3-chloroindole P1 group (B) resulted in improved anti-FXa activity (2a­2d). Compound 2b with a gem-dimethyl substitution at C1 of the ethylene linker was 10-fold more active than the unsubstituted 2. Modeling studies9 suggested that FXa potency could be further improved by modifying the methyl substituents in 2b to interact with the disulfide bridge region (S1b). We did not investigate this series further due to the negligible solubility and relatively low anticoagulant activity of 2b, the latter of which is suggestive of high protein binding. Another way of constraining the floppy ethylene linker in 1 and 2 is to tie back the C1 and the C2 CH2 groups to form cyclicdiamine derivatives (Table 2). We found that the cis racemic cyclohexyl analogs 3 and 5 were slightly (threefold) more active than the trans analogs

17. Compound 11 with a 3-chloroindole group was the most potent among compounds bearing chlorinated bicyclic (hetero) aromatic P1 groups (11­16). Adding a nitrogen in the thiophene ring of 9 resulted in more than three orders of magnitude loss of potency (18). Chlorine substitution and the position of the chlorine are essential to the compound's FXa inhibitory activity.12 Replacing the chlorine atom with a methyl group (9 vs 19), or a methoxy group (17 vs 20), and removing the chlorine atom (11 vs 21) resulted in fivefold to 120-fold decrease of potency. The 4-Cl-phenyl analog 17 was 30-fold and 70-fold more potent than the 3- and 2-Cl-phenyls (22, 23), respectively. Orthoor meta-substitution on the 4-chlorophenyl ring in 17 with F, Cl, OMe, Me, and SO2Me resulted in decreased FXa potency (22­32). 5-Chlorothiophene and 3-chloroindole in 9 and 7 were the two best P1 groups in both the five- and the sixmembered core series (Table 4). 6-Chloronaphthyl, 6chlorobenzo[b]thiophenyl, and 4-chlorophenyl P1 groups provided compounds that were one to two orders of magnitude less active than 9 and 7. Tables 3 and 4 show that subtle structural deviations from 5chlorothiophene and 3-chloroindole P1 groups reduced FXa potency drastically, revealing the importance of the S1 pocket of serine proteases for binding affinity. P4 SAR of (1R,2S)-cyclopentyldiamine and (1R,2S)cyclohexyldiamine derivatives. FXa activities of (1R,2S)-cyclopentyl and cyclohexyldiamine core systems containing a variety of P4 groups were studied using 5chlorothiophene and 3-chloroindole P1 groups (Table 5). Pyridones 7, 9, and 11 and a-CH2-N-pyrrolidinyl phenylcyclopropyl analogs 54­56 were the most potent FXa inhibitors (FXa Ki 6 1 nM) in both core systems. Compounds containing a variety of six-membered lactam-based P4 moieties, such as piperidinones 40­42, morpholinone 43, cyclic carbamate 44, and cyclic urea 45, were potent with Ki values less than 5 nM. The basic 2-dimethylaminomethyl imidazole 50 and piperidinone 42 were also similar in potency. Compounds 46 and 47 bearing five- and seven-membered lactam P4 groups were less potent than piperidinones 40­42. The cyclic sulfonamide in 48 was the least potent P4 group in this study. Table 5 shows that cyclohexyldiamine derivatives bearing the larger 3-chloroindole P1 group were slightly more potent than the cyclopentyldiamine counterparts. For example, compounds 7, 50, and 54 were two- to fivefold more potent than compounds 11, 49, and 53, respectively. In contrast, when using the smaller 5-chlorothiophene P1 group, the resulting cyclopentyldiamine derivatives were equal or slightly more potent than the corresponding cyclohexyldiamines (9 vs 37, fourfold; 55 vs 56, twofold; and 51 vs 52, twofold). Most compounds with good binding activity (FXa Ki < 2 nM) also demonstrated good anticoagulant activity in the clotting time functional assay. Compared with pyrazole-based raxazaban4 and apixaban,5 these cyclicdiamides were less potent in FXa binding affinity (FXa Ki). However,

4 and 6, respectively. The cyclohexyldiamine derivative 7 (FXa Ki = 0.67 nM) bearing a 3-chloroindole P1 group with a cis-(1R,2S) configuration was five times more potent than its enantiomer 8, and the cis cyclopentyldiamine derivative 9 (FXa Ki = 0.43 nM) bearing a 5-chlorothiophene P1 group with the same (1R,2S) configuration was 200-fold more potent than its enantiomer 10. Compounds 9 and 7 were threefold and 20-fold more potent than the corresponding ethylenediamine leads 1 and 2, respectively. The absolute stereochemistry of 9, cis-(1R,2S), was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis11 using the anomalous dispersion of sulfur and chlorine atoms. Given the potency of the cis analogs, the SAR discussion reported herein will therefore focus on the cis-(1R,2S)-cyclopentyldiamine and cis-(1R,2S)-cyclohexyldiamine core systems. P1 SAR of (1R,2S)-cyclopentyldiamine and (1R,2S)cyclohexyldiamine derivatives bearing phenylpyridone P4 group. In the cyclopentyldiamine series (Table 3), 9 with a 5-chlorothiophene group was the most potent among compounds bearing monocyclic P1 groups, and it was 80-fold more potent than the 4-chlorophenyl analog

be the result of the reduced lipophilicity, which in turn lowers protein binding. In general, the series of compounds in Table 5 were highly selective against other related serine proteases (see Table 6 for four representative compounds). The observed high selectivity resulted from the structural variations in the S1 and S4 pockets of the different serine proteases (e.g., the size difference of the S4 pockets, the Ala190Ser difference in the S1 pockets), evident in the overlay of the publicly available crystal structures. Linker SAR. Tables 7 and 8 list FXa potency of fiveand six-membered cores with different P1 and P4 linkers. Compounds 7 and 9 with P1 and P4 amide linkers were the most potent. Compounds with a planar P1 linker, such as amides 9 and 17, urea 57, and oxalamide 58, were much more potent than those with an aplanar linker, such as methylamine 59 and sulfonamide 60. Changing the P4 amide in 7 to a sulfonamide in 63 led to loss of potency, while the methylsulfonyl P4 linker analog 64 (racemic) resulted in 19-fold loss of potency. Different SAR of P4 linker was observed between the five- and six-membered core systems: in the five-membered core, reducing the P4 amide in 9 to a methylamine in 61 led to 10-fold loss of potency; while in the sixmembered ring system, the corresponding methylamine 65 had similar FXa potency as parent 7. Ortho substitution on the inner phenyl ring in cyclopentyl 9 with a fluorine atom in 62 resulted in a 10-fold drop of FXa potency; while for the six-membered ring, FXa potency of the fluorine analog 66 was maintained compared with 7. X-ray structures of compounds 7 and 9. Cyclopentyl-diamide 9 with a chlorothiophene P1 and cyclohexyl-diamide 7 with a chloroindole P1 were the most potent neutral leads in this series. X-ray crystal structures of 7-FXa13 and 9-FXa14 complexes were obtained with res° ° olution at 2.2 A and 1.8 A, respectively. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the interactions of 7 and 9, respectively, with the FXa residues in the active site. Figure 5 shows the overlay of the X-ray structures of FXa-bound ethylenediamide 1, cyclohexyldiamide 7, and cyclopentyldiamide 9. All three molecules bind in a similar extended manner, with the chloroheteroaryl groups occupying the S1 pocket and the phenylpyridone group bound to the S4 pocket. The pyridone ring in each of the three molecules forms an edge-to-face interaction with Try215, and stacks nicely between Tyr99 and Phe174. The chlorothiophene groups of 1 and 9 and the chloroindole group of 7 are buried deeply inside the S1 pocket (Fig. 5). The chlorine atoms occupy essentially the same position at the bottom of the S1 pocket, displacing a structurally conserved water and forming close contacts with Tyr228. The average ClÁ Á ÁTyr228CZ distance is ° 3.6 A. Such Cl­Tyr228 interaction (presumably Ar­ClÁ Á Áp interaction) is also observed in other inhibitor-FXa complexes.12 The narrow P1 SAR could be at least partially attributed to the high degree of directional preference15 of the Ar­ClÁ Á Áp interactions. The overall conformation of the cyclopentyldiamide 9 is very similar

chlorine atom at essentially the same position in the S1 pocket. The overlay of the X-ray structures of 7-FXa and 9-FXa (Fig. 5) clearly shows significant binding differences in both the cycloalkyl core and the amide linker region of 7 and 9, suggesting that different approaches may be needed to optimize the five- and the six-membered ring systems. The cyclohexyl ring in 7-FXa with a preferred bicyclic indole P1 group locates farther away from the S1 pocket than the cyclopentyl ring in 9-FXa bearing a smaller thiophene P1 group. Hydrogen bonding possibilities of the two amide linkers of 9 and 7 are different (see Figs. 3 and 4). In addition, the relative orientation of the two amides with their adjacent aromatic rings is different in these two compounds. In cyclopentyl 9, the P1 amide is almost coplanar with the thiophene ring, and the P4 amide is nearly coplanar with the inner phenyl ring; while in cyclohexyl 7, the two amides are not at the same plane as that of the indole or the inner

phenyl ring. This suggests that the amide linker region in the cyclopentyl core system may be less tolerable to structural changes than those in the cyclohexyl core system. Synthesis. Schemes 1 and 2 outline the synthesis of enantiopure cis-(1R,2S)-cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl-diamine derivatives bearing a variety of P4 groups. The requisite P4 acids were synthesized according to the straightforward transformations illustrated in sequences A to H (Scheme 1). The Boc-protected cyclicdiamine cores 67 were prepared from commercially available enantiopure benzyl protected amino alcohols via a sequence of deprotection, mesylation, azide displacement, and then reduction of the azide. Two subsequent amide formation reactions of the P4 and the P1 acids with cores 67 generated the desired products (Scheme 2). In summary, using both structure-based design and traditional medicinal chemistry approaches, we identified enantiopure cis-(1R,2S)-cycloalkyl diamine derivatives as a viable series of potent, selective FXa inhibitors that are structurally different from previously reported pyrazole-based scaffolds. The 5-chlorothiophene and 3-chloroindole P1 groups were identified as potent P1 fragments for FXa inhibition in this series. Example compounds bearing a variety of N-phenyl substituted lactam-based P4 groups and alpha-CH2­N-pyrrolidinyl-phenylcyclopropyl P4 group showed excellent binding affinity (<1 nM), good potency in human plasma clotting assay (<5 lM), and high selectivity against other serine proteases (>5000-fold). Among them, the cyclopentyl-diamide 9 and the cyclohexyldiamide 7 were the most potent neutral analogs with anticoagulant activity comparable to raxazaban and apixaban. In each of the X-ray structures of FXa-bound 9 and 7, the P1 group sits deep in the S1 subsite and there exist interactions between the chlorine and Tyr228. The crystal structures of 7-FXa and 9-FXa complexes provided insights to guide further structural optimization of the cyclicdiamine derivatives to modulate in vitro and in vivo properties, which shall be reported in future communications.
