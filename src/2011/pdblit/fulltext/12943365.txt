Key words: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Structural genomics, Osmotically inducible protein C, OsmC domain, KH domain Introduction The Berkeley structural genomics center (BSGC) has focused on Mycoplasma as its structural genomics target organisms because of their compact genome size as well as their relevance to human pathogenicity (http://www.strgen.org). MPN625 is one of the structural genomic targets of BSGC that has been selected by several criteria (molecular weight of less than 40 kDa, predicted water solubility, and absence of structural homologues in Protein Data Bank (PDB, http://www.pdb.org)) (http://www.strgen.org/status/ mptargets.html). MPN625 is presently annotated as an `osmotically inducible protein C like family' [1] and is a member of the OsmC domain family in the conserved domain database (CDD) [2]. The OsmC domain family (CDD ID: LOAD_osmc) includes an oxidative stress induced protein (organic hydrogen peroxide resistance protein, Ohr), an osmotic stress induced protein (OsmC), and many other proteins of unknown function annotated as `hypothetical.' The OsmC domain family is only found in prokaryotes (12 genes from Archaea, 55 genes from Bacteria). Although the OsmC domain shows a broad range in sequence identity, the sequence alignment implies that it has two highly conserved cysteine residues. No three-dimensional structures of the members of the OsmC domain family are known. We report the crystal structure of MPN625 at 2.85 Å resolution determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method.

The monomer has approximate dimensions of 50 Å 35 Å 30 Å with two domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain is an all structure composed of three -strands forming a -sheet. The C-terminal domain is a mixed alpha-beta structure composed of the 2-layer ( )-sandwich in the CATH classification [3]. Two identical monomers form a cylinder-shaped dimer with approximate dimensions of 65 Å 35 Å 35 Å. As shown in Fig 1, six helices are located inside and two six-stranded -sheets wrap around these helices in the dimer. Two highly conserved cysteine residues (Cys52, Cys119) form a disulfide bond within each monomer. The disulfide bond links two helices in the C-terminal domain and induces a structural constraint creating a kinked helix. Two conserved proline residues (Pro41, Pro120) are located in proximity to the disulfide bond. The structure suggests that the dimer may be a biological form rather than a crystallization artifact for the following reasons: 1) the interactions between monomers are very extensive and tight as manifested by many nonpolar interactions commonly observed in biologically functional oligomer interfaces [4]; 2) the surface area buried by the dimer (2,012 Å 2 for each monomer) is comparable to those from other oligomeric proteins and is larger than the area buried by typical crystal contacts [4]. A Dali [5] search in PDB found that the C-terminal domain of MPN625 had a similar fold to the N-terminal domain of Streptococcus pneumoniae conserved hypothetical protein SP14.3 (PDB ID: 1IB8) [6], the C-terminal domain of ERA (PDB ID: 1EGA), a GTP binding protein [7], and the N-terminal domain of ribosomal protein S3 (PDB ID: 1J5E)

Methods MPN625 (gi¦1673883) was cloned in pSKB3 expression system (gift from Steve Burley, Rockefeller University) and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/ pSJS1244 [9] cells upon induction with 0.5mM isopropyl- -d-thiogalactopyranoside. Selenomethionyl (Se-Met) protein was prepared according to the method of Doublie [10]. The cloned MPN625 containing an N-terminal His6-tag was affinity-purified from the soluble fraction using Talon metal affinity resin (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA). The target protein was bound onto a 5 ml HiTrap Q column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and eluted with a 10 column volume linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer. The protein was concentrated to 12.9 mg/ml in 20mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT, 300mM NaCl. The optimal crystallization condition was found to be 0.2 M Sodium Iodide, pH 6.9, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350), using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The crystals were soaked in a drop of mother liquor with 5% ethylene glycol (about 5 µl) for about 10 seconds before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and exposed to X-ray. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at three wavelengths at the Macromolecular Crystallography Facility beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using a Quantum 4 CCD detector (Area Detector System Corporation, Poway, CA) placed 250 mm from the sample. The oscillation range per image was 1.0° with no overlap between two contiguous images. X-ray diffraction data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK [11]. The synchrotron data were collected to 2.85 Å. Data statistics are summarized in Table I A. The crystal belongs to the primitive orthorhombic space group P2 12 12 1, with unit-cell parameters of a 66.36 Å, b 95.60 Å, and c 308.48 Å. The program SHELEXD [12] was used to locate the selenium sites in the crystal. The program SHARP [13] was used for phase refinement to 2.85 Å followed by solvent flattening with SOLOMON [14]. The map calculated by using the improved phases was not good enough to trace the backbone structure of the protein. However, the presence of improper

five-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) made by five dimers was identified during an initial backbone tracing. Ten-fold NCS density averaging was carried out using DM [15]. Partial models for 10

34 monomers were built using the O program [16]. Based on the partial models, the ten NCS matrices were refined using a software in the RAVE program package [17] of real-space averaging and densitymanipulation programs. The program CNS [18] was used for all refinement calculations. All the reflections in the remote data set between 20.0 Å and 2.85 Å were included throughout the refinement calculations. The non-crystallographic symmetry restraints among the ten subunits were applied during the refinement. Ten percent of the data were randomly chosen for free R factor cross validation. The refinement statistics are shown in Table I B. Isotropic B-factors for individual atoms were initially fixed to 15 Å 2 and were refined in the later stages. The 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps were used for the manual rebuilding between refinement cycles and for the location of solvent molecules. Atomic coordinates have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the access code of 1LQL. References

Discussion MPN625 protein is a prokaryote-unique protein belonging to a large domain-family of proteins that are induced by stress. The crystal structure provides a new structural template to model the rest of the members of this large protein domain family. The structure also reveals no obvious `active site' pocket or residues suggesting that it is not likely to be an enzyme, but a structural or regulatory protein in the signal transduction pathway of the stress response. The functional unit appears to be a homodimer, as suggested by the crystal structure and discussed above, and by size-exclusion column chromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, the arrangement of the dimers in the crystal suggests that they may form a helical `fibre' (Fig. 2) as a part of the protein's function in responding to external stresses.
