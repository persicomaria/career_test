ABSTRACT The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the most abundant natural auxin involved in many aspects of plant development and growth. The IAA levels in plants are modulated by a specific group of amidohydrolases from the peptidase M20D family that release the active hormone from its conjugated storage forms. Here, we describe the X-ray crystal structure of IAA-amino acid hydrolase IAAleucine resistantlike gene 2 (ILL2) from Arabidopsis ° thaliana at 2.0 A resolution. ILL2 preferentially hydrolyses the auxin-amino acid conjugate N(indol-3-acetyl)-alanine. The overall structure of ILL2 is reminiscent of dinuclear metallopeptidases from the M20 peptidase family. The structure consists of two domains, a larger catalytic domain with three-layer aba sandwich architecture and aminopeptidase topology and a smaller satellite domain with two-layer ab-sandwich architecture and a­bplaits topology. The metal-coordinating residues in the active site of ILL2 include a conserved cysteine that clearly distinguishes this protein from previously structurally characterized members of the M20 peptidase family. Modeling of N-(indol-3-acetyl)-alanine into the active site of ILL2 suggests that Leu175 serves as a key determinant for the amino acid side-chain specificity of this enzyme. Furthermore, a hydrophobic pocket nearby the catalytic dimetal center likely recognizes the indolyl moiety of the substrate. Finally, the active site of ILL2 harbors an absolutely conserved glutamate (Glu172), which is well positioned to act as a general acidbase residue. Overall, the structure of ILL2 suggests that this enzyme likely uses a catalytic mechanism that follows the paradigm established for the other enzymes of the M20 peptidase family.

INTRODUCTION Auxins are ubiquitous plant hormones involved in regulation of many aspects of plant development and growth including germination, root initiation, phototropism, leaf formation, and fruit development.1 One of the most common natural auxins is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). This hormone is present in plants as either a physiologically active free acid or as a nonactive conjugate in which the carboxyl group of IAA is derivatized with amino acids, peptides, or sugars.1,2 IAA conjugates represent a storage pool from which the active hormone can be released by selective classes of enzymes, such as aminoacid amidohydrolases in the case of IAA-amino acid conjugates, thus providing a means for the regulation of auxin levels in plants.1,3 The most common auxin conjugates in Arabidopsis thaliana include IAAAla, IAA-Leu, IAA-Asp, IAA-Glu, IAA-glucose, and IAA-peptide.3­5 IAA-Asp may serve as an intermediate in the auxindegradation pathway.6 The gene locus At5g56660.1 of A. thaliana encodes a 48-kDa IAA-leucine-resistantlike gene 2 precursor (ILL2), an IAA-amino acid hydrolase from the amidohydrolase family (also known as the peptidase M20D family) involved in auxin metabolism.7 Multiple enzymes from the amidohydrolase family have been identified in A. thaliana. Initially, ILR1 and IAR3 (also known as ILL4) were identified through mutant screens based on reduced sensitivity to IAA-conjugates in the root-inhibition bioassay.8,9 Five additional isoforms ILL1, ILL2, ILL3, ILL5, and ILL6, which share 40­85% sequence identity, have since been described in A. thaliana and shown to have orthologs in other dicots as well as monocots and gymnosperms.7,10,11 Such

widespread occurrence of a multigene family indicates an ancient evolutionary divergence within the plant kingdom. The A. thaliana IAA-hydrolases lack close homologs in nonplant higher eukaryotes, although they share a more distant relationship to an array of bacterial hydrolases (30­40% sequence identity). The A. thaliana isoforms ILL1, IAR3, and ILL5 meet stringent bioinformatics criteria for localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) including having a predicted amino terminal signal sequence and carboxy terminal His/Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu tetrapeptide that serves as an ER retrieval tag.9,12,13 The importance of ER localization is not clear; however, as phylogenetic trees of 66 orthologs across the plant kingdom resolved two separate monocot clades, one with members possessing ER retrieval sequences and one lacking them.11 The remaining A. thaliana isoforms either lack ER retrieval sequence motifs (ILL3, Lys-Ser-Gly-Asp; ILL6, Asp-Lys-His-Ser) or have variant motifs for which there is evidence of ER retention in fungal and animal systems but not yet in plants (ILR1, Lys-Ser-Glu-Leu; ILL2, His-Glu-Glu-Leu).14,15 Several A. thaliana amidohydrolases have been characterized biochemically. In enzymatic assays with purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-amidohydrolase fusion proteins, ILL2 showed the highest overall hydrolytic activity among these enzymes with a clear preference for IAA-Ala.10 In contrast, ILL1, which shares 87% identity with ILL2, had the lowest activity toward all the substrates tested. ILR1 preferred IAA-Leu and bulky aromatic conjugates IAA-Tyr and IAA-Phe. Although IAR3 also hydrolyzed IAA-amino acid conjugates with small side chains, it acted as a relatively poor catalyst. A disparate study has shown that this isoform can hydrolyze amino acid conjugates of the plant hormone jasmonic acid, suggesting a role in wound repair response.16,17 The hydrolysis rates for each IAA-amino acid conjugate correlated with the results of a root inhibition assay, suggesting that the hydrolase activity is directly linked to biological activity of IAA conjugates.7 The gene expression of ILL1, ILL2, IAR3, and ILR1 has been examined in Northern and promoter-b-glucuronidase assays.7 ILL2 and ILR1 showed overlapping but distinct pattern of expression in A. thaliana seedlings and adult plants. Interestingly, unlike the triple ilr1-iar3-ill2 mutant, single ill2 mutation had only limited effect on the inhibition of the root elongation in the presence of various IAA conjugates suggesting redundancy of function with the other two A. thaliana amidohydrolase isoforms.7 Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of A. thali° ana ILL2 (UniProt code ILL2_ARATH18) at 2.0 A resolution and discuss the structural basis for the substrate specificity of this enzyme. The structure of ILL2 represents a sequence-to-structure target with <30% sequence identity to any structure in Protein Data Bank19 at the time of selection and deposition determined under the National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative.

METHODS
Prediction of signal peptide residues

The ILL2 amino acid sequence encoded by At5g56660.1 was analyzed with web-based programs to predict subcellular localization. Secretory pathway targeting was predicted by TargetP20 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/TargetP/) and confirmed with iPSORT21 (http:// hc.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/iPSORT/) and SignalP12 (http:// www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). The predictions for ILL2 and homologous amidohydrolases from A. thaliana indicated a secretory pathway localization as well as a highly reliable cleavage score (>0.8 with TargetP and SignalP) for all members except ILL5_ARATH. The putative signal peptide of ILL2 corresponded to amino terminal residues 1­22 based on these analyses.
Expression and purification of ILL2

The gene At5g56660.1 encoding mature ILL2 (residues 23­439) was cloned and both the unlabeled and selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled proteins were expressed and purified following the standard Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics pipeline protocols for cloning,22 protein expression,23 protein purification,24 and overall bioinformatics management.25 In short, the cDNA-encoding ILL2 was cloned into a pDONR221 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and for expression purposes transferred into a pVP13 plasmid, a custom vector derived from pQE80 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The predicted signal peptide-spanning residues 1­22 of ILL2 was eliminated at the cloning stage. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli B834 p(lacI1RARE) cells using 2 L of self-inducing media. Upon sonication of the harvested cells, the protein in the supernatant was purified via immobilized nickel affinity chromatography, and TEV protease was used to cleave the affinity/solubility tag consisting of His-maltose-binding protein.6 After tag capture by subtractive nickel affinity chromatography, and a final desalting step, the proteins were concentrated to 10 mg/mL and dialyzed against the protein buffer (50 mM NaCl, 5 mM TRIS pH 8.0). Protein aliquots were then drop frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 193 K. Protein purifications resulted in 9.0 mg of native and 7.5 mg of SeMet-labeled recombinant proteins.
Crystallization and structure solution of ILL2

Crystals of ILL2 were grown at 293 K by the hanging drop method from a 10 mg mL21 protein solution in the protein buffer mixed with an equal amount of well solution containing 14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG 1.5K), 80 mM MgSO4, 100 mM N-cyclohexyl-2aminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES) pH 9.0. Crystals were cryoprotected at 293 K by soaking in well solutions containing 7, 14, and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and were

X-ray diffraction data for phasing were collected near the selenium K absorption edge (12,660 eV) from SeMetlabeled ILL2 crystals at Structural Biology Center (SBCCAT) 19-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. X-ray diffraction data used for refinement were collected at 12,665 eV from native ILL2 crystals at the same beam line. The diffraction images were integrated and scaled using HKL2000.26 The structure was automatically phased and density modified using solve/resolve using single wavelength anomalous diffraction methodology.27,28 The initial model was built using Arp/Warp.29 The structure was completed with multiple cycles of iterative manual building in Xfit30 and refinement in REFMAC5.31 All refinement steps were monitored using an Rfree value based on 5.1% independent reflections. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed using MOLPROBITY.32 The substrate docking to the active site was performed using Coot33 and the PyMOL34 sculpting module. The figures were prepared using PyMOL. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The three-dimensional crystal structure of ILL2 was phased with a single wavelength anomalous diffraction ° method35,36 using a 2.0 A diffraction dataset collected near the selenium K-edge from selenomethionyl crystals ° of ILL2. The structure was refined against a 2.0 A dataset collected from the native ILL2 crystal. The final model has an R factor of 15.7% and an Rfree of 20.4%. Detailed data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. ILL2 crystallized in space group P3221 with one monomer per asymmetric unit. The final model consists of residues 37­228, 238­274, 283­428, and additional 285 water molecules. Residues 1­36, 229­ 237, 275­282, and 429­439 of ILL2 were not modeled, as they were either not present (residues 1­22 of the signal peptide) or not resolved in the electron density map. Ile92 adopts an unusual backbone conformation (u 5 80.28, w 5 263.18) in what has traditionally been considered to be a forbidden region of the Ramachandran plot. Inspection of the electron density map for this residue did not reveal any ambiguity in the modeling of this residue [Fig. 1(a)]. In fact, while the adopted conformation is unusual, it is allowed based on the up-to-date MOLPROBITY backbone geometry validation criteria.32

The structure of ILL2 consists of two distinct domains. The larger catalytic domain (residues 1­217 and 333­439) consists of a central eight-stranded b-sheet sandwiched between five and two a-helices on either side [Fig. 1(b),

red and cyan]. Based on the CATH classification,37 the catalytic domain adopts a three-layer (aba) sandwich architecture with aminopeptidase topology found in bacterial dinuclear zinc exopeptidases. Two short b-strands connect the catalytic domain to a satellite domain, which spans the residues 218­332. The satellite domain is inserted between b-strand 6 and helix E of the catalytic domain. It adopts a ferredoxinlike fold with two-layer (ab) sandwich architecture and a­b-plaits topology. The domain consists of a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet flanked on one side by

There are several minor differences in loop conformations between the proteins. Two notable insertions exist in ILL2 spanning residues 387­393 of the catalytic domain and residues 325­330 of

the satellite domain. Importantly, the proteins share a structurally conserved active site [Fig. 2(a)]. The second closest structural homolog of ILL2, with a VAST score of 27.5, is Pseudomonas sp. CPG2.39 The proteins structurally align for 346 residues with an ° RMSD of 3.5 A and 15.6% sequence identity. The overall fold of CPG2 is of the same topology as that of ILL2. However, while the structures are similar, the structural homology is clearly more distant than that in the case of ILL2 and yxeP [compare divergence of protein backbone traces in Fig. 2(a,b)]. Significant structural differences between ILL2 and CPG2 exist in multiple surface loops.

Also, coordination of the dimetal center by CPG2 differs from that seen in yxeP and ILL2 as detailed below.
The active site of ILL2

Structural homologs of ILL2 bind two metal ions in the active site. Available biochemical evidence suggests that hydrolysis of IAA-conjugates by ILL2 and other A. thaliana amidohydrolases is also metal dependent. It has been established that these enzymes prefer Mn21 as a cofactor and ILR1 could also use Cu21.10 The crystallization conditions used to grow crystals of ILL2 did not include metal ions. The resulting apoILL2 structure revealed two water molecules in the active site. However, as shown in Figure 2(a), the active sites of apoILL2 and yxeP, which possesses a dimetal center, are closely similar. The catalytic domains of these proteins superpose with ° an all-atom RMSD of 0.5 A. Therefore, we have identified five residues likely involved in metal coordination in ILL2, namely Cys137, Glu173, and His397 that coordinate metal 1, and Cys137, His139, and His197 that coordinate metal 2. In addition, a bridging water molecule likely completes the coordination of the metals; however, this feature was not unambiguously resolved in yxeP due to limited resolution. As expected, all the coordinating residues are fully conserved in all known A. thaliana amidohydrolases as well as other related proteins (see Fig. 3). It has been reported that mutations of His405 of bacterial IAA-Asp hydrolase, which corresponds to His397 of ILL2, lead to a complete loss of the enzymatic activity.42 This observation is consistent with a crucial role of this histidine in coordinating a metal ion in the active site. Several additional loss-of-function mutations have been described in ILL2 homologs from A. thaliana (Table II). Mutations E69K and G139D in ILR1 likely compromise the geometry of the dimetal-binding site. We note that there are slight differences in conformations of putative ligand residues between yxeP and apoILL2, presumably due to a lack of stabilizing interactions with metal ions in ILL2. The differences include alternate conformations of Cys137 and a minor displacement and rotation of His397 [Fig. 2(a)]. Importantly, Cys98 of yxeP, a residue

analogous to Cys137 of ILL2, coordinates both metals in the active site of yxeP. The coordination of metals by this bridging cysteine residue seems to be a unique feature of ILL2 and yxeP, both members of the peptidase M20D family that clearly distinguishes these enzymes from other structurally characterized enzymes from the M20 family, in which a conserved aspartate coordinates metals in a bidentate mode [Asp141 in CPG2, Fig. 2(b)]. We queried sequence databases by the FFAS03 server43 (using PSIBLAST NR85S multiple sequence alignment option) and found over 700 bacterial and plant proteins that show >30% sequence identity to ILL2 and contain cysteine at the position corresponding to Cys137 of ILL2. A large portion of identified proteins is currently functionally unannotated. Some of the annotated proteins from the list include hippurate hydrolases, a range of N-acyl-Lamino acid amidohydrolases, and a single N-acetyldiaminopimelate deacetylase. There are additional differences in the metal coordination between ILL2 and CPG2 (taken here as a representative of M20 family of peptidases). First, Glu200 in CPG2 replaces His197 in ILL2. Second, ``Metal 2'' is in CPG2 coordinated by His112, which originates from a different secondary structure element than its functional equivalent His139 of ILL2 [Fig. 2(b), double arrow]. His112 of CGP2 is the carboxy terminal residue of the third b-strand, while His139 of ILL2 marks the beginning of the helix C of the catalytic domain. In summary, it is clear that the proteins from the M20D peptidase family can be distinguished from the other M20 peptidases based on interesting remodeling of the active site that changed its preference from zinc(II) to manganese(II).
The substrate-binding model

To understand how ILL2 binds and selectively recognizes its preferred substrate, IAA-Ala, we modeled this compound into the active site of ILL2. We based the initial placement and conformation of IAA-Ala on the structure of transition-statelike inhibitor (S)-2-(4-iodobenzylphosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (GPI-18431) bound to the active site of glutamate carboxypetidase II

Structural hypothesis about of origins of the defect Conformation of the loop harboring general base Glu172 and metal ligand Glu173 will be altered due to loss of stabilizing hydrogen-bond. Possible salt bridge to Asp114 could further disturb local geometry next to the active site. Steric clash resulting from the mutation will directly compromise positioning of metal coordinating residues Cys137 and His139. Mutation places bulky, charged residue into a hydrophobic core of the protein formed by Met145, Ile196, Leu198, Leu384, Val407, and Ile414. Protein likely misfolds. Mutation results in a loss of hydrogen bonds to His380 and fully conserved Asn337.

(GCPII, PDB ID 2c6c).44 The catalytic domains of ILL2 and GCPII share a similar fold (with a VAST score of ° 16.7, RMSD of 2.9 A for 221 aligned residues with 13.6% sequence identity) as well as the active site with a dimetal center. Both the substrate of ILL2, IAA-Ala, and the transition-statelike inhibitor of GCPII, GPI-18431, have similar size and share some common structural features, including an amino terminal aromatic group and free carboxylate group at the carboxy terminus. The carbonyl oxygen of the scissile amide bond of IAA-Ala was posi° tioned and constrained to reside within 2 A from Metal 1. In addition, the dimetal center of ILL2, which was modeled based on that of yxeP, was restrained. Two conformational modifications were necessary to position IAA-Ala into the active site cavity of ILL2. First, a sizeable hydrophobic cavity presented itself for the indole ring IAA-Ala [Fig. 4(a,b)]. The indole ring was therefore steered into this cavity. Second, the side chain of Ser367 of ILL2 clashed with the terminal carboxylate of IAA-Ala. Inspection of the electron density map of apo-ILL2 revealed that the rotamer of Ser367 was not well defined, and a different rotamer could relieve the clash with the modeled substrate. In fact, the new rotamer Ser367 may be stabilized by hydrogen bond(s) to Arg293. To reach the optimal conformation, IAA-Ala as well as protein res° idues and water molecules in 8 A radius from the carbonyl oxygen of IAA-Ala were allowed to relax under van der Waals constraints. The resulting model of the active site with the bound substrate is presented in Figure 4(a). Several key insights can be made from this model. First, the indole ring of IAA-Ala is likely stabilized by binding within a hydrophobic cavity formed by residues

Leu215, Val364, Leu383, Phe381, and Phe214. These residues remain hydrophobic in A. thaliana amidopeptidases, with the exception of Glu363 of ILL1 that corresponds to Val364 of ILL2 (see Fig. 3). Second, Glu172 is well positioned to act as a general acid-base residue during the catalysis. This residue can act as a general base to facilitate deprotonation of a water molecule coordinated to Metal 2 and thus assist in a nucleophilic attact on the amide carbonyl of IAA-amino acid conjugate. The resulting negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate is likely stabilized by electrostatic interaction with manganese(II) dimetal center. Next, the protonated Glu172 can act as a general acid donating a proton to the amide nitrogen of IAA-amino acid conjugate in order to facilitate the fissure of the scissile bond by forming a better leaving group. Glu172 is strictly conserved in all A. thaliana amidohydrolases and their homologs from the M20D peptidase family. Importantly, it is homologous to glutamates implicated as general acid-base residues in other M20 peptidases (e.g., Glu175 of CPG2, or Glu424 of GCPII). The structural similarity of ILL2 and the enzymes of the M20 peptidase family as well as conservation of the key catalytic residue and the similar chemical nature of substrates (e.g., being amides) of these enzymes suggest that ILL2 uses a catalytic mechanism similar to that proposed for the peptidases from M20 family. This mechanism is, in turn, a variation of a mechanism established for prototypical zinc proteases such as carboxypeptidase A.45,46 Residues Glu368, Arg110, Gln169, and Asp369 are highly conserved among proteins that show >30% identity to ILL2. This set of residues seems to be involved in

The active site of ILL2 with a docked substrate. A: A stereo view of the active site of ILL2 with a modeled substrate N-(indole-3-acetyl)-alanine (IAAAla; yellow sticks). Important residues of the active site of ILL2 are shown as sticks and are color coded as follows: metal-coordinating residues (cyan), residues forming a hydrophobic cavity that may bind the indole ring of a substrate (orange), a putative general acid-base residue Glu172 (green) and a putative side-chain selectivity filter residue Leu175 (magenta), other conserved residues (gray) involved in the formation of active site hydrogen bond network. B: A stereo view of a surface representation of the ILL2 active site with the docked IAA-Ala (yellow sticks). The hydrophobic cavity (orange) accommodates the indole ring of a substrate. The carbonyl group of a scissile peptide bond of the substrate is coordinated by one of the metals in the active site (green spheres) while the C-terminal carboxyl of the substrate points toward the surface of the protein. Leucine 175 (magenta) restricts the size of the amino acid side chain of the substrate that can fit into the active site, providing the basis for the substrate specificity of ILL2.

a hydrogen bond network nearby the active site next to the putative general acid-base residue Glu172. Glu368 is found in a salt bridge with the buried Arg110 and is therefore likely present in its basic form. We speculate that a function of Glu368 and Asp369 may be to increase the pKa value of Glu172. Third, Leu175 seems to be responsible for selectivity against IAA-amino acid conjugates with amino acid side chains bulkier than alanine or serine [Fig. 4(b)]. In fact, Leu175 is not conserved in A. thaliana amidohydrolases, it is only present in ILL2 and its closest homolog ILL1. In ILR1, this residue is replaced by Tyr176, which could

stabilize the aromatic side chains of the preferred substrates of this amidohydrolase isoform (IAA-Phe or IAATyr) by a stacking interaction. The remaining amidohydrolases from A. thaliana contain glycine in the structurally equivalent position. In the case of CPG2, Arg324 has been suggested to be responsible for recognition and stabilization of the glutamate side chain of the peptide substrates.44 When the active sites of CPG2 and ILL2 were overlaid and compared, the guanidyl moiety of Arg324 of ° CPG2 was found about 3 A (in the direction away from the active site) from the side chain of Leu175 of ILL2, further supporting the hypothesis about the role Leu175.

The wheat IAR3 homolog (TaIAR3, UniProt Code Q66VR4_WHEAT) has been shown to be specific for Nindole-3-butyryl-alanine or -glycine and N-indole-3-propionyl-alanine.47 Judging from the multiple sequence alignment in Figure 3, all important residues of the active site remain conserved in TaIAR3. Glycine 168 of TaIAR3 corresponds to the putative selectivity filter residue Leu175 of ILL2. The only other notable difference is a single residue insertion (Thr375 of TaIAR3) located in the vicinity of the residues forming the hydrophobic cavity for the indole ring. It is possible that these two modifications within the active site of TaIAR3 contribute to the ability this enzyme to productively bind and hydrolyze auxin derivatives with longer fatty acid chains. Fourth, the terminal carboxyl group of IAA-Ala is likely stabilized by a pair of hydrogen bonds to the main chain of Ser367. However, based on our model, this group is not recognized by additional protein residues. This is in a contrast to GCPII, in which the analogous group is stabilized by electrostatic interaction with Arg210.44 The only basic residue in the vicinity of the active site of ILL2 is Arg293. This residue is strictly conserved in all A. thaliana amidopeptidases and also in other members of the M20 peptidase family (Arg288 of CPG2, and Arg280 of carboxypeptidase T), suggesting an important role for this residue. However, the distance between the guanidinium moiety of Arg293 and the ter° minal carboxyl of modeled IAA-Ala is about 7 A. Therefore, the enzyme would have to undergo a significant conformational change upon substrate binding to allow for stabilization of the terminal carboxyl of IAA-Ala. Instead, it seems more likely that Arg293 stabilizes the overall active site architecture by hydrogen bonding to the main-chain carbonyls of Gly366 and Ala216.
