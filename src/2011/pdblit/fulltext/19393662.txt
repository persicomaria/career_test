Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs) G protein (OpgG) is required for OPGs biosynthesis. OPGs from Escherichia coli are branched glucans, with a backbone of b-1,2 glucose units and with branches attached by b-1,6 linkages. In Proteobacteria, OPGs are involved in osmoprotection, biofilm formation, virulence and resistance to antibiotics. Despite their important biological implications, enzymes synthesizing OPGs are poorly character° ized. Here, we report the 2.5 A crystal structure of OpgG from E. coli. The structure was solved using a selenemethionine derivative of OpgG and the multiple anomalous diffraction method (MAD). The protein is composed of two b-sandwich domains connected by one turn of 310 helix. The N-terminal domain (residues 22­388) displays a 25-stranded b-sandwich fold found in several carbohydrate-related proteins. It exhibits a large cleft comprising many aromatic and acidic residues. This putative binding site shares some similarities with enzymes such as galactose mutarotase and glucodextranase, suggesting a potential catalytic role for this domain in OPG synthesis. On the other hand, the C-terminal domain (residues 401­512) has a seven-stranded immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold, found in many proteins where it is mainly implicated in interactions with other molecules. The structural data suggest that OpgG is an OPG branching enzyme in which the catalytic activity is located in the large N-terminal domain and controlled via the smaller C-terminal domain.

Introduction
Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs) are important components of the bacterial envelope of many Proteobacteria. OPGs from different species share several structural characteristics: glucose is the sole component sugar and residues are linked essentially by b-glycosidic bonds.1,2 OPGs of Escherichia coli are heterogeneous in size, varying from five to 12 glucose residues, with the principal

species containing eight or nine glucose residues. Their structures are highly branched, the backbone consisting of b-1,2 linked glucose units to which the branches are attached by b-1,6 linkages. They are substituted to various degrees by sn-1 phosphoglycerol, phosphoethanolamine, and succinic acid O-ester. Very similar structures with only slight variations in the degree of polymerization have been found in other members of the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria, including Erwinia chrysanthemi and Pseudomonas syringae. In E. coli, the opgGH (or mdoGH) operon encodes two proteins (OpgG and OpgH) that are both required for the assembly of the polyglucose structure of OPGs.3 OpgH is a 97 kDa glycosyltransferase spanning the cytoplasmic membrane.4 The in vitro products of this glycosyltransferase5 are linear oligomers of b-1,2-linked glucose units

196 synthesized from UDP-glucose,6 suggesting that the b-1,2 backbone of OPG is synthesized first by OpgH and the branches are introduced subsequently. OpgH could form a channel for OPG translocation from the cytoplasm to the periplasm during the synthesis. OpgG is a 56 kDa periplasmic protein whose function has not been fully characterized but which is necessary for the production of OPGs. The current working hypothesis is that OpgG cooperates with OpgH, probably by catalyzing the addition of branches to the linear backbone emerging on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. As UDP-glucose is present only in the cytoplasm, the most favored hypothesis is that branching could involve a rearrangement of glucose units originally linked through b-1,2 bonds in the linear chains: glucose residues could be cleaved off from b-1,2 linkages and transferred to the same (or a different) polyglucose chain, but now with b-1,6 linkages. The formation of branch-points in glycogen is well known to involve this type of process. The absence of a reconstituted OpgH­OpgG in vitro system has so far impeded the functional characterization of OpgG. Two cytoplasmic membrane proteins have been implicated in OPG substitutions in E. coli. OpgB is a phosphoglycerol transferase with its activity located at the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane, 7 while OpgC is required for the periplamic succinylation of the OPGs.8 The opgGH operon is under osmotic control.1,2 Many Gram-negative bacteria respond to hypoosmotic conditions by synthesizing large amounts of periplasmic glucans. Mutations in E. coli that block the synthesis of periplasmic glucans, although not impairing the rate of growth appreciably, do have pleiotropic effects9 on cell motility, the pattern of outer membrane proteins and the regulation of capsule production. Interestingly, several reports point to a role for OPGs in the regulation of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) required for development of biofilm architecture.10 Microorganisms organized into biofilms are resistant to host defense mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. For instance, biofilms of uropathogenic E. coli persist in the urinary tract and catheter surfaces and may cause resistance in urinary tract infections, one of the most common bacterial infections of any

organism.11 Although numerous regulators of EPS have been described, osmotic shift is one of the first environmental signals shown to strongly and rapidly induce EPS synthesis.12 In E. coli, colanic acid synthesis is thus induced through the response of a two-component regulatory system, RcsB and RcsC.13 A model has been proposed, based on opgH inactivation, suggesting that the low levels of periplasmic OPGs act to signal RcsC to activate EPS synthesis via RcsB.14 Inactivation of the opgH gene leads to increased expression of colanic acid required for normal biofilm formation.15 However, premature colanic expression blocks adhesion of planktonic cells.11 Also, a mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, which has a transposon insertion in opgH, was shown to have a dramatically reduced virulence against Caenorhabditis elegans and was not able to induce mortality in the mouse model.16 These data illustrate the important role of periplasmic glucans and of the opgGH operon in bacterial pathogenesis. The preponderance of biofilm communities in nature as well as their medical impact provides an incentive for seeking information about the molecular structure of enzymes involved in OPGs biosynthesis. Here, we report the determination of the structure of E. coli K12 OpgG ° by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.5 A. This OpgG protein is identical with that found in the highly virulent uropathogenic E. coli UPEC strain CFT073 (with the exception of one mutation) and provides a framework for homologous OpgG proteins whose genes have been identified in the genome of many bacterial species, including Salmonella enterica pv. thyphimurium,17 P. aeruginosa,18 Shigella flexneri19 and Vibrio cholerae.20 This is the first reported three-dimensional structure of an enzyme involved in OPG biosynthesis.

197 which can be described as a b-sandwich, is composed of 25 b-strands organized in four bsheets, surrounded by two a-helices and six 310 helices (Figures 1 and 2). The length of the various strands ranges from three to 13 residues. The Nterminal domain starts with helices a1 and a2 (Met22­Gly37 and Lys55­Gln60, respectively), which are connected by a coiled loop. This loop is probably very flexible, as inferred from its poor electron density. The four central b-sheets are denoted sheet A (b1 and b5), sheet B (b2, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b15, b20, b23 and b24), sheet C (b3, b4, b11, b12, b13, b14, b18, b19, b21, b22 and b25) and sheet D (b16 and b17). All strands in these b-sheets, except b3 and b11, are anti-parallel. Sheets B and C form a large, two-layer b-sandwich with an important twist of about 1808 (Figure 1). The topological arrangement of the first b-strands is original, in the fact that the beginning of b6 and the preceding loop go through the strands b2 and b3. The connectivity between the different structural elements in this region is confirmed by the experimental electron density map. The N-terminal domain comprises a large cleft (Figures 1 and 3) located between sheet A, a2, sheet D and the loops b2-b3, b22-b23, a5-a6 and b16-b17. The bottom of the cleft is composed of sheet B. The loop between b10 and b11 restrains slightly the accessibility to the cleft. Amino acid similarities between OpgG and homologous proteins are essentially found in the amino-terminal domain (Figure 3(a)). Most of these residues are located in the core of the protein and especially in b-sheet B. The crevice in the N-terminal domain is Y-shaped ° and has a length of about 35 A, a width that ranges ° ° ° from 9 A to 15 A and a depth of w15 A. An analysis of charge distribution at the protein surface has been performed with GRASP (Figure 3(b)).24 It reveals that the cleft is the most electronegative region of the protein. The right-hand side and the bottom of the cleft contain many acidic residues: Glu81, Asp90, Asp146, Glu147, Glu183, Glu184, Asp273, Asp324, Asp326, Asp327, Glu349, Asp357, Glu358, Asp361 and Asp 370. Two basic residues, Arg158 and Arg171, lie in the bottom of the crevice. These two residues are conserved in all the OpgG proteins identified so far. Many aromatic residues point towards the cavity. Tyr56, Tyr59, Tyr83, Tyr88, Phe89, Tyr156, Tyr166 and Phe185 are located on the left-hand side and the bottom of the crevice (Figure 4). Most of these acidic and aromatic residues are conserved among the OpgG from different species, pointing to an important functional role for the crevice (Figure 3(a)). This putative active site shares some similarities with the substrate binding site in glucodextranase from Arthrobacter globiformis I42. This protein, which hydrolyses a-1-6-glycosidic bonds of dextran, has a substrate-binding site that can be divided into two sides. The first is essentially made of residues (Glu, Asp, Arg and Gln) that bind acarbose by hydrophilic interactions; and the second comprises aromatic residues.25

A gel filtration analysis of OpgG has revealed a single peak at an elution volume corresponding to the molecular size of a monomeric OpgG. The dimerization observed is thus most probably favored by the crystal packing. The structure of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit is very similar and superimposes with an ° overall RMSD of 0.45 A, indicating that the molecules have an identical structure. Most of the protein backbone and side-chains are well defined. The final model comprises 490 residues (Phe23­Ser49; Met54­His516) for molecule A and 487 (Met22­Ser49; Met54­Val512) for molecule B, with 477 water molecules and one sodium ion. The geometrical and stereochemical quality of the model was evaluated with PROCHECK.21,22 In all, 99.2% of the non-glycine residues are located in the most-favoured and additionally allowed regions, and 0.7% in the generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The crystallographic refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. An extra electron density was observed between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, which was assigned to a sodium ion. This ion probably comes from either the crystallization solution which contains Na­Mes buffer and sodium acetate or the protein solution, which contains 30 mM NaCl. OpgG can be divided into two distinct structural domains (Figure 1). The N-terminal domain (residues 22­388), which includes about 75% of the protein, is connected to the C-terminal, sevenstranded b-sandwich domain (residues 401­512) by one turn of 310 helix. There are extensive interactions between the two domains, via the prolongation of an N-terminal domain b-sheet. OpgG adopts an elongated structure comprising 33 strands, two a-helices and six 310 helices (Figure 1). Its topology is illustrated in Figure 2 using the TOPS program.23 The N-terminal domain of OpgG The N-terminal domain structure is dominated by extensive layers of b-sheets. Its architecture,

Search for structural homologues Analyses with DALI26 and SSM27 reveal that OpgG matches with a number of proteins displaying a similar b-sandwich motif but where the number of strands and/or connectivities are different. These proteins are: galactose mutarotase,28,29 hyaluronate lyase,30,31 chondroitinase,32 glucodextranase,25 glucanotransferase,33 domain 5 of b-

galactosidase,34,35 copper amine oxidase36 and Hi1317, a protein of Haemophilus influenzae of unknown function (N. Bonander et al., unpublished results). These proteins, except the galactose mutarotase and the protein from H. influenzae, have at least another domain in addition to the b-sandwich motif, and that other domain bears the catalytic activity. The similarity of OpgG with these proteins is confined to the N-terminal domain. All these

structural analogues are involved in the metabolism or binding of carbohydrate-derived molecules, with the exception of copper amine oxidase. OpgG superimposes onto the galactose mutarotase of Lactoccocus lactis (PDB 1L7J or 1MMU in complex with glucose) with an RMSD value of ° 3.79 A . The two proteins show a cleft at a comparable position, which is the active site in the mutarotase (Figure 5). This result, together with the residue conservation between OpgG and other members of the OpgG family, highlights the

potentially important role for this putative binding site in the catalytic activity of OpgG.

binding of another molecule, either another protein, or carbohydrates. Indeed, the C-terminal domain in OpgG is structurally similar to domain 3 of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin extracellular region (PDB 1CWV),37,38 a bacterial integrin-binding protein. It is similar also to domains in carbohydrate-related proteins, for example domain 2 of sialidase from Micromonospora viridifaciens (PDB 1EUT),39 domain 4 of E. coli b-galactosidase (PDB 1BGL),34,35 domain B of glucodextranase from A. globiformis (PDB 1UG9),25 the carbohydratebinding domain 9 family (PDB 1I8A)40 or the Nterminal domain of the E. coli a-1,4 glucan branching enzyme BE (PDB 1M7X) (Figure 6).41

Discussion
The precise role of OpgG proteins, their relations with the partner proteins involved in OPGs biosynthesis and the overall organization of this pathway are still to be unraveled. In an effort to progress in the functional characterization of OpgG, for which an enzymatic activity is not easy to define in vitro, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme. The reported structure reveals that the enzyme is organized into two domains. The N-terminal domain is structurally similar to proteins that have a b-sandwich motif, while the C-terminal has an Ig-like fold. The N-terminal domain architecture is characteristic of proteins involved in carbohydrate interaction and/or enzymatic activities towards carbohydrates. Within this domain, a large cleft has been identified that contains several acidic and aromatic residues. Most of these residues are conserved in related OpgGs. These two categories of residues are often found in the substrate-binding site of carbohydratebinding proteins, as for example in L. lactis galactose mutarotase,29 A. globiformis glucodextranase,25 Fibrobacter succinogenes b-glucanase,42 or the E. coli glycogen branching enzyme.41 In these proteins, the charged residues are involved in hydrogen bonding

sheet E and b28 of sheet F. They form a sevenstranded b-sandwich, twisted by 408. In addition to the 389­400 segment that connects the N and C-terminal domains, b-sheet F extends bsheet C from the N-terminal domain. The link between the two b-sheets is made by b19 (sheet C) and b33 (sheet F), arranged in a parallel fashion. This forms a large, 14-stranded b-sheet that goes through the protein from one side to the opposite one, with a twist of about 2608 (Figures 1 and 2). A similar seven-stranded b-sheet domain architecture is found in a large number of proteins. A search for structural homologues with DALI reveals 225 hits, which all have an immunoglobulin-like bsandwich fold and almost all have at least two domains. Most of the proteins that possess such a domain are implicated in the interaction or in the

with the substrate, and the aromatic residues participate in the stacking with the glycopyrannose rings of the carbohydrate substrates. This observation provides strong support for the hypothesis that OpgG is involved in carbohydrate interaction, and this putative active site may serve as the binding cavity for the linear backbone of OPGs under synthesis. In such a model, the N-terminal domain would serve as the catalytic core subunit. The C-terminal domain of OpgG has architecture comparable to that of protein domains that are involved in the interaction with another protein or with carbohydrates. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of E. coli a-1,4-glucan branching enzyme BE (PDB 1M7X) is characterized by a related Ig-like b sandwich structure. BE catalyzes the formation of a1-6 branches in glycogen synthesis. In BE, the linear a-1-4 linked glucose chain is first cleaved and then the resulting oligosaccharide is linked in a-1-6 position to the carbohydrate chain. BE belongs to the a-amylase family 13 characterized by an (a/b)barrel domain that supports the catalytic residues. The structure of BE shows that the enzyme is organized in three domains. The (a/b) barrel represents the central domain, with two adjacent N and C-terminal domains, both composed of seven b-strands. Only the N-terminal domain has an Ig-like b-sandwich fold. In the case of BE, the function of the Ig-like domain has been identified and was shown to play a role in the branching patterns of glycogen.43,44 Preiss and co-workers have elaborated several chimeric or truncated maize endosperm BE proteins (mBE) and have analyzed their resulting enzymatic properties. Their data demonstrate that the N-terminal domain is implicated in the branching pattern and the length of the glucose chains that are transferred in a a-1-6 position, while the carboxy-terminal domain plays a role in the substrate specificity, substrate binding and in the catalytic efficiency of these branching enzymes.45

As observed for the amino and carboxy-terminal domains of BE, the amino acid similarities between E. coli OpgG and the OpgG protein family are much weaker in the C-terminal domain. By analogy with BE, if we reason on the hypothesis that the E. coli OpgG protein is an OPG branching enzyme, the Nterminal domain, with a more conserved sequence, would represent the potential catalytic domain and the smaller C-terminal domain would act to modulate this enzymatic activity. This modulation could result from interactions with the substrate or with other proteins involved in this biosynthetic pathway. It is known from in vitro studies that the linear b-1-2 backbone of OPGs is synthesized by the transmembrane b-1-2 glycosyltransferase OpgH. Two loops of OpgH are exposed in the periplasmic space,4 and could be involved in interactions with OpgG via its C-terminal domain. These interactions may be required for the efficient OPG backbone transfer from OpgH to OpgG, during their synthesis. Modulation of the OpgG activity via its Cterminal domain could bring the specificity for the glycosidic bonds of the substrate or some catalytic features of this potential enzyme, including the control of the branching pattern of the OPGs, of the length of the branches, without excluding a role in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The low amino acid conservation observed in this last domain could explain the structural diversity of the OPGs among the different species.1 Additional experiments will be required to elucidate the exact function of the E. coli OpgG protein and to decipher the role of each domain.

Materials and Methods
Cloning The E. coli opgG gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a plasmid template containing

202
the gene already modified to express the periplasmic protein with a short C-terminal histidine-tag. The forward primer: 5 0 -CAAGCCATATGTTCAGTATTGATG-3 0 was designed to not amplify the first 66 nucleotides encoding the N-terminal periplasmic localization signal and to introduce an NdeI restriction site (in bold) including an ATG start codon (underlined). A BamHI restriction site (in bold) was inserted into the reverse primer: 5 0 TTAGGGATCCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTG-3 0 . This DNA fragment was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET-29a(C) vector (Novagen Inc.). The resulting OpgG recombinant cytoplasmic protein comprises 498 residues including residues 23­511 of the precursor OpgG protein, an additional N-terminal methionine residue and a C-terminal histidine-tag of eight residues (VEHHHHHH), with a total calculated molecular mass of 56.5 kDa. Expression and purification of the selenomethioninelabeled OpgG BL21(DE3)star cells (Novagen Inc.) were co-transformed by the constructed pET29a-opgG and the pLysS (Novagen Inc.) plasmids. A 5 ml culture was inoculated with a few fresh colonies and grown overnight at 37 8C, under agitation, in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin (25 mg mlK1) and chloramphenicol (35 mg mlK1). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in 5 ml of M9 minimal medium. This inoculum was transferred into 500 ml of M9 minimal medium (M9 salts, 4 g lK1 glucose, 1 g lK1 NH4Cl, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mg lK1 ZnSO4, 0.1 mg lK1 ammonium citrate, MEM vitamin cocktail solution (Sigma)), supplemented with kanamycin (25 mg mlK1) and chloramphenicol(35 mg mlK1). The cells were grown at 37 8C. One hour before the induction, a solution containing 50 mg of L-lysine, L-phenylalanine and Lthreonine, and 25 mg of L-isoleucine, L-leucine and Lvaline was added to the culture to inhibit the methionine ´ biosynthesis pathway (protocol adapted from Doublie et al.46) and half an hour later 25 mg of L-selenomethionine was added to allow the incorporation of selenomethionine into the protein. When the absorbance at 600 nm (A600) reached 0.55, the induction was performed by addition of isopropylthiogalactoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mM, and the temperature was lowered to 30 8C. The culture was pursued for an additional three hours. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at K80 8C. Cells corresponding to a half-liter culture were thawed on ice in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor EDTA-free (Roche)). The lysis reaction was performed by addition of 15 mg of lysozyme at 4 8C for 20 minutes with gentle agitation, then 1 mg of DNAse and RNAse A were added and lysis was continued for an additional 20 minutes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for 45 minutes at 4 8C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5 ml Ni2C HiTrap chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), which was pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol). The column was then washed with 100 ml of buffer A containing 25 mM imidazole and the elution of the protein was made in one step with buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 l of buffer B (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT). The sample was loaded onto

an anion-exchange column (MonoQ HR 10/10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 mM to 600 mM NaCl in buffer B over 22 column volumes. The pooled fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 8C against 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT. The protein was concentrated on a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience) with a cut-off of 5 kDa. The final protein concentration of 16 mg mlK1 was estimated by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as standard (Protein Assay Reagent, Bio-Rad). Selenomethionine incorporation was checked by trypsic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The concentrated protein was filtered (pore size 0.22 mm), divided into 100 ml portions, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at K80 8C. This protocol allows the production of about 30 mg of SeMet protein, which was estimated to be over 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and gel-filtration analysis with a Superdex-75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). OpgG elutes from the column with a molecular mass of approximately 57 kDa, which is compatible with a monomeric form of the protein. Crystallization All crystallization attempts were carried out using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion technique. The hanging drops were set up by mixing 2 ml of the protein solution with an equal volume of the precipitant and then equilibrating them against 0.5 ml of the precipitant solution at 293 K. The final crystallization condition was 52­57% (w/v) PEG 200, 0.09 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M NaMes (pH 6.5). Crystals grew to their final size in two to three days and had a maximum size of 0.8 mm! 0.27 mm!0.2 mm. The condition was cryoprotectant. Crystals were thus flash-frozen directly at 100 K in liquid nitrogen and conserved at this temperature. Well-diffracting crystals were selected in the laboratory using CuKa radiation from a rotating-anode X-ray generator with a Mar345 image plate detector and an Oxford Cryosystem Cryostream device. Data collection and processing A single selenomethionine-labeled protein crystal was used to collect three diffraction datasets at the beamline FIP/BM30, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) Grenoble, France. On the basis of the X-ray fluorescence scan of the frozen crystal, three wavelengths (lpeak, linfl., lremote) were chosen around the selenium K° absorption edge (0.9795 A). Diffraction data were col° lected to 2.7 A using a MAR CCD (165 mm). In order to collect data at a higher resolution, a fourth data set was recorded at the peak wavelength with a 2q angle of 58. The ° resulting resolution was 2.5 A. The diffraction data for each set were indexed, integrated and scaled with the XDS package software.47 The two data sets recorded at the peak wavelength were merged. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit cell ° ° ° dimensions aZ63.86 A, bZ88.12 A, cZ215.65 A. The ° Matthews coefficient (VM)48 is 2.7 A3 DaK1, which corresponds to a solvent content of 54% (v/v), with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1.

determined using ShelXd.49 The Se atom parameters were refined and initial experimental phases were calculated at ° 2.7 A by the MAD method using CNS.50 These phases ° were subsequently improved and extended to 2.5 A by solvent flattening. The experimental electron density map was of good quality, and the complete polypeptide chains could be traced except for the regions corresponding to residues 50­53 and the C-terminal histidine tag of each monomer. An initial model was built with ARP/wARP and GuiSIDE as implemented in the CCP4 suite.51 This model was improved by several steps of manual building using the graphics program Turbo-Frodo.52 All refinement procedures were carried out in CNS. The progress in the refinement was monitored by crossvalidation (Rfree) with a test set comprising 10% of the randomly selected reflections. First, the two monomers were repositioned in the same asymmetric unit and their positions were refined using a rigid body refinement procedure. The refinement was performed with CNS ° using the peak data set to 2.5 A with the maximum likelihood target function. Correction for a flat bulk solvent was also applied. The first group of water molecules was added when peaks in the 2FoKFc density were O2s and had a stereochemistry compatible with at least one hydrogen bond with a protein atom or another water molecule. In the final stages, the s cutoff was reduced to 1.0 s and water molecules with a B-factor O ° 50 A2 were removed from the model. The overall refinement procedure led to an R-factor of 19.2% for all ° ° measured X-ray data from 20 A to 2.5 A resolution. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The final model includes residues 23­49 and 54­516 for monomer A, residues 22­49 and 54­512 for monomer B, 477 water molecules and a sodium ion. The side-chains for residues 44, 55, 119, 122, 123, 420, 514 and 515 in chain A, and 44, 55, 63, 117, 119, 122 and 123 in chain B are not defined in the final electron density map. The stereochemistry of the final structure was evaluated with the program PROCHECK.21,22 Figures 1, 4, 5 and 6 were generated with MOLMOL.53 Protein Data Bank accession number The atomic coordinates and structure factors of OpgG from E. coli have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with access code 1TXK.
