The Polypteriformes (bichirs and reedfish) are a family of ray-finned fishes of ancient lineage. Insulin has been isolated from an extract of the pancreas and upper gastrointestinal tract of the bichir Polypterus senegalis and its primary structure established as A-chain: Gly­Ile­Val­Glu­Gln­Cys­Cys­Asp­Thr­Pro10­Cys­ Ser­ Leu­Tyr­Asp­Leu­Glu­Asn­Tyr­Cys20­Asn; B-chain: Ala­Ala­Asn­Arg­His­Leu­Cys­Gly­Ser­His10­Leu­ Val­ Glu­Ala­Leu­Tyr­Leu­Val­Cys­Gly20­Asn­Arg­ Gly­Phe­ Phe­Tyr­Ile­Pro­Ser­Lys30­Met. Despite the fact that Polypterus insulin contains several unusual structural features that are not found in insulins from other jawed fish (Asp at A-8, Thr at A-9, Arg at B-4, Asn at B-21, Ile at B-27, Met at B-31), all the residues in human insulin that are involved in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization have been conserved. A comparison of the structures of insulins from a range of species indicates that Polypterus insulin most closely resembles paddlefish insulin II (seven amino acid substitutions). In contrast, Polypterus glucagon (His­Ser­ Gln­Gly­Thr­Phe­Thr­Asn­Asp­Tyr10­Thr­Lys­Tyr­ Gln­Asp­Ser­Arg­Arg­Ala­Gln20­Asp­Phe­Val­Gln­ Trp­Leu­Met­Ser­Asn) most closely resembles the glucagons from the gar Lepisosteus spatula and the bowfin Amia calva (four amino acid substitutions). The data are consistent with the conclusion based on comparison of morphological characteristics that the Polypterids

are the most basal living group of the Actinopterygians with evolutionary connections to both the Acipenserids and the Neopterygians. 1998 Academic Press The Polypterids are elongated spiny fishes with rudimentary lungs that inhabit freshwater streams and lakes of tropical Africa. They are united in a single family, Polypteriformes, comprising 12 species in two genera, Polypterus (bichirs) and Calamoichthys (reedfish). Over the past 150 years, the position of the Polypteriformes in phylogeny has been uncertain. The family (also referred to as the Cladistia and Branchiopterygii) has been allied with the gars in the Holostei (Muller, 1844)), with the ``crossopterygians'' (Cope, ¨ 1892), and with the Dipnoi (lungfish) (Nelson, 1969), and has also been regarded as the plesiomorph sistergroup of, but distinct from, the Actinopterygii (Bjerring, 1985). The Polypteriformes are now generally considered to represent a highly specialized survivor of the primitive Actinopterygii and are included in this subclass (Patterson, 1982; Jamieson, 1992). Based on their current systematic position, the Polypteriformes have evolutionary connections to the ancestors of all three extant lines of Gnathostomata: the Chondrichthyes, the Actinopterygii, and the Sarcopterygii (Janvier, 1996). In the terminology of Gardiner (1993), the Actinopterygii may be divided into the ``lower actinopterygians,'' which comprise only two extant lineages, the Polypteriformes and the Acipenseriformes (sturgeons

and paddlefish), and the ``higher actinopterygians,'' which comprise the Ginglymodi (gars), Halecomorphi (bowfin), and Teleostei (teleosts) and are collectively referred to as the Neopterygii. There have been few molecular phylogenetic studies that involve Polypterus but a comparison of 28 S ribosomal RNA nucleotide sequences supports the inclusion of the Polypteriformes in the Actinopterygii (Le et al., 1993). ^ This present article is part of a series of studies designed to characterize islet hormones from phylogenetically ancient fish (reviewed in Conlon et al., 1997) and describes the purification and structural characterization of insulin and glucagon from the bichir Polypterus senegalis.

Purification of Polypterus Insulin
The total tissue extract, after partial purification on Sep-Pak cartridges, was redissolved in 1 M acetic acid (2 ml) and chromatographed on a 1.6 90-cm column of Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 1 M acetic acid. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 24 ml/h and fractions (2.0 ml) were collected. Absorbance was measured at 280 nm. The concentration of insulin-like immunoreactivity in the fractions was determined at a dilution of 1:30. Fractions containing insulin were pooled and injected onto a 1 25-cm Vydac 218TP510 C-18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/ water at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The concentration of acetonitrile in the eluting solvent was raised to 21% (v/v) over 10 min and then raised to 49% (v/v) over 60 min using linear gradients. Absorbance was measured at 214 and 280 nm. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and assayed for insulin-like immunoreactivity at a dilution of 1:30. The peak designated I (containing Polypterus insulin) (Fig. 1A) was rechromatographed on a 0.46 25-cm Vydac 214TP54 C-4 reversed-phase column equilibrated with acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (210/789/1) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The concentration of acetonitrile in the eluting solvent was raised to 42% over 40 min using a linear gradient. Polypterus insulin was purified to near homogeneity, as assessed by peak symmetry, by chromatography on a 0.46 25-cm Vydac 219TP54 phenyl column under the same conditions used for the C-4 column.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Extraction
Sub-adult bichir (29 specimens, 6 female; weight 35­44 g; length 18­26 cm) were supplied by Baileys Wholesale Tropical Fish (San Diego, CA). The animals were anesthetized by immersion in 0.02% benzocaine solution and blood was removed by transcardiac perfusion with 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.9% NaCl and heparin (2 USP units/ml). Disseminated pancreatic tissue and upper small intestine combined (10.0 g) were removed by dissection and extracted with ethanol/0.7 M HCl (3/1 v/v; 900 ml) as previously described (Conlon et al., 1991). After centrifugation (1600g for 1 h at 4°C), ethanol was removed from the supernatant under reduced pressure. Peptide material was isolated from the extract using Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Bound material was eluted with acetonitrile/water/ trifluoroacetic acid (70/29/1, v/v/v.) and freeze-dried.

Purification of Polypterus Glucagon
The peak designated G, containing Polypterus glucagon (Fig. 1A) was rechromatographed on 0.46 25-cm Vydac 214TP54 C-4 and 0.46 25-cm Vydac 219TP54 phenyl reversed-phase columns under the same conditions used for the purification of insulin.

Radioimmunoassay
Insulin-like immunoreactivity was measured using an antiserum raised against pig insulin as previously described (Flatt and Bailey, 1981). Glucagon-like immunoreactivity was measured with an antiserum directed against the central region of porcine glucagon as previously described (Conlon and Thim, 1985).

Structural Characterization
Polypterus insulin (approximately 2 nmol) was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with dithiothreitol (2 mg) in 0.1 M Tris­HCl/6 M guanidine hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.5 (0.4 ml), under an atmosphere of argon. Cysteine residues were derivatized by addition of

4-vinylpyridine (3 µl) and the pyridylethylated A- and B-chains of insulin were separated on a 0.46 25-cm Vydac 218TP54 C-18 column under the conditions used for the purification of intact insulin (Fig. 1B). Amino acid compositions were determined in duplicate by precolumn derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate using an Applied Biosystems Model 420A derivatizer followed by reversed-phase HPLC with an Applied Biosystems Model 130A separation system. Hydrolysis (24 h at 110° in 5.7 M HCl) of approximately 500 pmol of sample was carried out. Cysteine and tryptophan residues were not determined. The primary structures of the A-chain and B-chain of Polypterus insulin and Polypterus glucagon were determined by automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems Model 471A sequenator modified for detection of phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acid derivatives under gradient elution conditions. Approximately 1 nmol portions of the peptides were used. The detection limit for the PTH derivatives was 1 pmol. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed at the Novo/Nordisk Research Institute (Bagsvaerd, Denmark) using a API III LC/MS/MS triple quadrupole instrument (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Approximately 100 pmol of sample was used and the accuracy of the mass determinations was at least 0.1%.

profile is shown in Fig. 1A. Insulin-like immunoreactivity was associated with the single prominent peak designated I. Rechromatography of this fraction on an analytical Vydac C-4 column (Fig. 1B) revealed that the material was heterogeneous and the insulin-like immunoreactivity was associated with the minor peak delineated by the arrows. Polypterus insulin was purified to near homogeneity (as assessed by symmetrical peak shape) by a final chromatography on a Vydac phenyl column (Fig. 1C). The final yield of the pure peptide was approximately 2.5 nmol (equivalent to 250 pmol/g tissue).

Purification of Polypterus Glucagon
The concentration of glucagon-like immunoreactivity in the crude tissue extract was very low (approximately 1 pmol/g), indicating that the structure of Polypterus glucagon was appreciably different from that of porcine glucagon in the central region of the molecule (probably residues 10­15) (Conlon and Thim, 1985). After chromatography on a semipreparative Vydac C-18 column (Fig. 1A), the peak designated G was associated with glucagon-like immunoreactivity. Polypterus glucagon was purified to near homogeneity by successive chromatographies on analytical Vydac C-4 (Fig. 2A) and Vydac phenyl (Fig. 2B) columns and the final yield of pure material was 4.5 nmol (equivalent to 450 pmol/g tissue).

RESULTS
Purification of Polypterus Insulin
The crude extract of the combined pancreas and upper intestine contained a detectable concentration (approximately 10 pmol/g tissue weight) of insulinlike immunoreactivity measured with an antiserum raised against pig insulin, but the immunoreactivity in serial dilutions of the extract did not diminish in parallel with the pig insulin standard. The tissue extract, after partial purification on Sep-Pak cartridges, was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 gelpermeation column and the immunoreactive material was eluted from the column as a single peak with maximum immunoreactivity at the same elution volume as human insulin. Fractions containing immunoreactive insulin were pooled and injected onto a semipreparative Vydac C-18 column and the elution

Structural Characterization of Polypterus Insulin and Glucagon
The primary structures of the pyridylethylated A-chain and B-chain of Polypterus insulin were determined by automated Edman degradation and the results are shown in Table 1. It was possible to identify without ambiguity phenylthiohydantoin-coupled amino acid for 21 cycles of operation of the sequenator during sequence analysis of the A-chain and for 31 cycles during analysis of the B-chain. The results of amino acid analysis demonstrated that the A-chain of Polypterus insulin had the composition Asx 3.7 (4), Glx 3.2 (3), Ser 1.3 (1), Gly 1.4 (1), Thr 1.1 (1), Pro 1.0 (1), Tyr 1.7 (2), Val 0.6 (1), Ile 0.6 (1), Leu 2.0 (2) (mol residue/mol peptide). The composition of the B-chain was determined to be Asx 2.1 (2), Glx 1.2 (1), Ser 2.0 (2), Gly 3.1 (3), His 1.9 (2), Arg 2.2 (2), Ala 3.1 (3), Pro 1.1

DISCUSSION
The pancreas of Polypterus is described by Epple and Brinn (1975) as extending along the abdominal vessels and the gastrointestinal tract and covering in part the

surface of the liver, which it invades by following the branches of the portal vein. The islets are present in highest concentration in the region close to the papilla of the common bile duct. In view of the disseminated nature of the endocrine pancreatic tissue, it was decided to extract the entire upper gastrointestinal tract, including the portion of the liver in the neighborhood of the bile duct. Fortunately, Polypterus insulin showed sufficient cross-reactivity with an antiserum raised against porcine insulin (Flatt and Bailey, 1981) that fractions of chromatographic effluent containing the peptide could be easily identified by radioimmunoassay. The precise epitope(s) recognized by the polyclonal antiserum used in the assay is not known but it is believed to comprise a particular three-dimensional conformation in the molecule rather than a contiguous region of amino acids in either the A-chain or the B-chain. The reactivity of Polypterus insulin is comparable to that of insulins from teleost fish such as coho salmon (Plisetskaya et al., 1985) and the paddlefish (Nguyen et al., 1994) whereas insulin from the African lungfish, which probably adopts a conformation that is appreciably different from pig insulin (Conlon et al., 1997), shows negligible reactivity toward this antiserum. In Fig. 3, the primary structure of Polypterus insulin is compared with the structures of insulins from representatives of the Chondrichthyes [Holocephali: Pacific ratfish Hydrolagus colliei (Conlon et al., 1989); Elasmobranchii: ray Torpedo marmorata (Conlon and Thim, 1986)]; Actinopteryrigii [Acipenseriformes: paddlefish Polyodon spathula (Nguyen et al., 1994); Lepisosteiformes: gar Lepisosteus spatula (Pollack et al., 1987); Amiiformes: bowfin Amia calva (Conlon et al., 1991); Teleostei: coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch (Plisetskaya et al., 1985)]; and Sarcopterygii [Dipnoi: African lungfish, Polypterus annectens (Conlon et al., 1997)]. Polypterus insulin contains several unusual structural features that are not found in any other fish insulin characterized to date. The amino acid substitutions Asp at A-8 and Thr at A-9 have not been observed in any other insulins; Arg at B-4, Asn at B-21, and Ile at B-27 have been found only in the divergent insulins from hystricomorph rodents (Bajaj et al., 1986); and Met at B-31 occurs only in insulin from the Agnathan, the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa (Cutfield et al., 1979).

The data in Fig. 3 show that Polypterus insulin most closely resembles paddlefish insulin II (seven amino acid substitutions). Two molecular forms of insulin that differ by a single amino acid substitution were isolated from the paddlefish pancreas, and these insulins show closest structural similarity (six amino acid substitutions) to insulin from the gar (Nguyen et al., 1994). Several studies (Bajaj et al., 1984; Dores et al., 1996) have pointed out the limitations of using a comparison of the amino acid sequences of insulin to infer phylogenetic relationships between species. In fact, a maximum parsimony analysis based on the sequences shown in Fig. 3 yields little useful phylogenetic information as the cladogram contains a polytomy (unresolved branch point) that includes the bichir, lungfish, and the clade containing the Actinopterygian fishes (J. E. Platz and J. M. Conlon, unpublished data). In general, the amino acid sequences of relatively small neurohormonal peptides are not useful as molecular markers for inferring phylogenetic relationships between species as the resulting clado-

grams based on their characteristics contain features that are clearly at variance with the current consensus based on analysis of morphological characteristics and the fossil record (Hedges et al., 1990). On the other hand, Naylor and Brown (1997), who have carried out a phylogenetic parsimony analysis of the entire proteincoding portion of the mitochondrial genome of 19 well-characterized taxa, have sounded the cautionary note that increasing the amount of sequence information does not in itself lead to an improved phylogenetic estimate. Nevertheless, the similarities between insulins from paddlefish, gar, and bichir are consistent with the conclusion based on morphological characteristics that the Acipenseriformes are a sister-group to the Neopterygians and the Polypteriformes are a sistergroup to this combined group (Grande and Bemis, 1996). The amino acid sequence of Polypterus insulin is compared with that of human insulin in Fig. 3. There are 11 amino acid substitutions in the insulins from the two species but those residues on the surface of the human insulin that that are considered to compose the receptor-binding region (A-1­A-3, A-5, A-19, A-21, B-22­B-26) (Baker et al., 1988) have been conserved in Polypterus. Similarly, a recent alanine-scanning mutagenesis study has shown that alanine substitutions at residues B-8, B-11, and B-13, in addition to A-19, are most disruptive for binding to the insulin receptor (Kristensen et al., 1997) and these residues have also been conserved in Polypterus. The amino acids in human insulin involved in dimer formation (B-12, B-16, B-20, B-24, B-26, and B-28) and hexamer formation (B-6, B-10, B-14, B-17, B-18, A-13, and A-14) are retained in Polypterus insulin. Consequently, Polypterus insulin may be expected to possess a conformation and biological potency that is similar to human insulin. This situation is reminiscent of the fact that the identical insulin from the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus contains 14 amino acid substitutions relative to human insulin but is equipotent with human insulin in binding to the recombinant human insulin receptor (Conlon et al., 1995) and is equipotent with porcine insulin in binding to the insulin receptor in rat liver (Leibush et al., 1997). In the case of Lampetra/Petromyzon insulin, as with Polypterus insulin, those residues composing the receptor-binding domain are conserved (Fig. 3). In view of

the low concentration of insulin in the tissues and the difficulty and expense of obtaining the species, it is improbable that we will be able to obtain sufficient pure Polypterus insulin to investigate its biological properties. The primary structure of Polypterus glucagon is compared with the structures of glucagons from the Pacific ratfish (Conlon et al., 1987), Torpedo (Conlon and Thim, 1985), paddlefish (Nguyen et al., 1994), gar (Pollock et al., 1988), bowfin (Conlon et al., 1993), coho salmon (Plisetskaya et al., 1986), and humans in Fig. 4. Compared with human glucagon, Polypterus glucagon contains the unusual substitutions Ser11 = Thr, not previously observed in any other glucagon yet characterized, and Leu14 = Gln, which is also found in salmon glucagon. It has been shown that the serine residue at position 11 is not required either for receptor recognition or for signal transduction (Unson et al., 1994). Unexpectedly, in view of the similarity of their insulins, Polypterus glucagon is quite different from both molecular forms of glucagon isolated from the paddlefish pancreas (13 and 14 amino acid substitutions). The peptide more closely resembles the glucagons from the gar (Lepisosteoformes) and the bowfin (Amiiformes) with four amino acid differences from each. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the Polypterids, as the most basal living group of the Actinopterygians, have evolutionary connections to the Neopterygians, but suggests that the genes encoding paddlefish glucagons have been subjected to an accelerated rate of molecular evolution.
