Solution Structure of v-Conopeptide MrIA, a Modulator of the Human Norepinephrine Transporter

Received 13 May 2005; accepted 23 May 2005 Published online 1 June 2005 in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com). DOI 10.1002/bip.20302

Abstract: The -conopeptides MrIA and MrIB are 13-residue peptides with two disulfide bonds that inhibit human and rat norepinephrine transporter systems and are of significant interest for the design of novel drugs involved in pain treatment. In the current study we have determined the solution structure of MrIA using NMR spectroscopy. The major element of secondary structure is a bhairpin with the two strands connected by an inverse c-turn. The residues primarily involved in activity have previously been shown to be located in the turn region (Sharpe, I. A.; Palant, E.; Schroder, C. I.; Kaye, D. M.; Adams, D. J.; Alewood, P. F.; Lewis, R. J. J Biol Chem 2003, 278, 40317­40323), which appears to be more flexible than the -strands based on disorder in the ensemble of calculated structures. Analogues of MrIA with N-terminal truncations indicate that the N-terminal residues play a role in defining a stable conformation and the native disulfide connectivity. In particular, noncovalent interactions between Val3 and Hyp12 are likely to be involved in maintaining a stable conformation. The N-terminus also affects activity, as a single N-terminal deletion introduced additional pharmacology at rat vas deferens, while deleting the first two amino acids reduced v-conopeptide potency.

INTRODUCTION
Coral reef ecosystems house an extraordinary diversity of invertebrate species, many of which use novel bioactive compounds as a part of defensive or prey capture strategies. Predatory molluscs of the genus Conus (comprising approximately 500 species) are highly specialized, with venoms that target fish, worms, and other molluscs. The venom is injected through a harpoon-like radular tooth and contains a mixture of constrained peptides called conotoxins, which contain 10­40 amino acids and up to five disulfide bonds.1­3 The peptide cocktail targets a diverse range of ion-channels and receptors and leads to rapid and efficient immobilization of the prey.4,5 MrIA and MrIB are two closely related 13-residue peptides that were recently discovered in the venom of Conus marmoreus and classified as -conopeptides by Sharpe et al.6 based on their activity at the neuronal norepinephrine transporter (NET). Peptides identical to MrIA were isolated in separate studies by McIntosh et al.7 and Balaji et al.8 and termed mr10a and CMrVIB, respectively. The study by Balaji et al.8 also reported the sequences of two related peptides, CMrVIA and CMrX, and classified this family as conotoxins despite its undetermined pharmacology. The sequences of the -conopeptides CMrVIA and CMrX are shown in Table I. Clearly, these peptides share great sequence similarity, suggesting that they belong to the same conotoxin class. Although the length of the peptides and the number of cysteine residues of the -conopeptides resemble the - and -conotoxins, the disulfide connectivity and the spacings between the cysteine residues differ from all other characterized conotoxins. The sequences of selected - and -conopeptides are shown in Table I, highlighting their ``globular'' disulfide connectivity (CysI-CysIII, CysIICysIV) in contrast to the ``ribbon'' connectivity (CysICysIV, CysII-CysIII) of the -conopeptides. Despite the sequence similarities, CMrVIA (i.e., truncated MrIA) and CMrX induce different effects when injected intracerebroventricularly in mice: CMrVIA induces seizures, whereas CMrX induces flaccid paralysis.8 As noted above, MrIA and MrIB are selective inhibitors of the norepinephrine transporter.6,9 The NET belongs to a superfamily of Naþ- and Cl­dependent transporters that includes transporters for dopamine, serotonin, -aminobutyric acid, betaine, glycine, proline, and taurine.10,11 Since the NET plays a key role in reducing levels of neurally released norepinephrine, it has influence on learning, memory, endocrine, and autonomic functions.12 Therefore, it is of great interest to find compounds targeting this transporter, as drugs that inhibit the NET may be used to treat a number of neuro-

logical disorders, including depression,13 schizophrenia,14 and anxiety15 as well as possibly modulating pain pathways.16­18 The -conopeptides appear to be free of the nonselective effects of existing small molecule inhibitors of the NET6 and can therefore be used as tools to develop new NET inhibitors. An alanine scan of MrIA has revealed that the residues of the first intercysteine loop (Table I), as well as the His residue, are important for binding to the NET.9 An NMR chemical shift analysis was performed on the alanine mutants and indicated a perturbation of the backbone when Gly6 is replaced with an alanine. The charged state of the C-terminus of MrIA does not appear to play a significant role in activity, as the nonnative, amidated C-terminal form of MrIA, MrIA-NH2, is only 1.5- and 2-fold more potent than MrIA and MrIB-NH2, respectively, at blocking the NET.6 There have been no experimental structures reported for MrIA and only a relatively low resolution NMR structure of MrIB is available.6 In the current study we report for the first time the solution structure of the pharmaceutically relevant peptide MrIA-NH23. This analysis has revealed an unusual conformation for one of the residues thought to be involved in binding. Furthermore, we have examined truncated analogues of MrIA and they have indicated a structural role for the three N-terminal residues that influence -conopeptide pharmacology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Peptide Synthesis
MrIA-NH2 and truncated analogues were synthesized with Boc chemistry using methods previously described.19

Solution Structure of -Conopeptide MrIA The following side-chain protection groups were used: BocAsn(xanthyl)-OH, Boc-Cys(4-methylbenzyl)-OH, Boc-Tyr(2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl)-OH, Boc-Lys(2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl), Boc-His(dinitrophenyl), Boc-Hyp(O-benzyl)-OH. Experience with other conotoxins suggested that rather than utilizing directed formation of the disulfide bonds it is more efficient to use a single oxidation reaction and purify any resulting disulfide isomers. The peptides were oxidized in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, and produced predominantly two isomers that were readily separated and purified using reverse-phase HPLC with aqueous acetonitrile gradients (solvent A: 0.1% TFA in H2O; solvent B: 90% acetonitrile, 10% H2O, 0.09% TFA). Gradients of either 1 or 0.5% solvent B/min were generally employed. Masses were analyzed using electrospray mass spectrometry. The native isomer eluted later than the other isomer as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The yields of the correctly folded forms were approximately 10%.

Structure Calculations
NOE volumes were obtained from the 150 and 400 ms NOESY spectra. The cross peaks were classified as strong ° ° ° (<2.7 A), medium (<3.5 A), weak (<5.0 A), or very ° ). Pseudoatom corrections of 1.5 A for ° weak (<6.0 A ° for methylene, and 2.0 A for tyrosine ring ° methyl, 1.0 A protons were added. Backbone dihedral restraints of À120 6 408 were applied for 3JHN-H > 8.5 Hz and À60 6 308 for 3JHN-H < 5.0 Hz. Additional f angle restraints (­100 6 808) were applied where the intraresidue dN(i,i) NOE was clearly weaker than the sequential dN(i,iþ1) NOE. Stereospecific assignments of -methylene protons and 1 dihedral angles were derived from 3JH-H coupling constants, measured from ECOSY spectra, in combination with NOE peak intensities from the 150 ms NOESY spectra. No hydrogen bond restraints were included in the structure calculations but hydrogen bonds were present in the final structures consistent with the slowly exchanging amide protons. Structures were calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols within CNS version 1.0.26 The starting structures included disulfide bonds and were generated using random (f, ') dihedral angles and energy minimized to produce structures with the correct local geometry. A set of 50 structures was generated by a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol as described recently for other conotoxins.27­30 Structures were analyzed using PROMOTIF31 and PROCHECK-NMR.32

NMR Spectroscopy
Samples for NMR contained $ 2 mM peptide in either 2 H2O or 90% H2O/10% 2H2O at pH 3.5. 2D total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY),20 nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy (NOESY),21 double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY),22 and exclusive correlation spectroscopy (ECOSY)23 spectra were acquired on either a Bruker ARX 500 MHz or AVANCE 750 MHz spectrometer with a shielded gradient unit. Spectra were acquired at 281, 287, and 298 K and were referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulponate. The temperature was maintained within 6 0.1 K, using a BT V2000 control unit and a Bruker BCU refrigeration unit. NOESY spectra were acquired with 100, 150, 300, and 400 ms mixing times, and TOCSY spectra were acquired with 55 or 110 ms mixing times. Water suppression in TOCSY and NOESY spectra was achieved using a modified water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation24 sequence. Water suppression for DQF-COSY spectra and all other spectra recorded in 2H2O was achieved by use of low-power irradiation at the residual water resonance during the relaxation delay. Spectra were acquired with 4096 data points in F2 and 512 in F1 and multiplied with squared sine bell functions shifted by 908. The data were zero-filled to give matrix sizes of 2048 Â 2048 real data points. Information on slowly exchanging amide protons was obtained by acquisition of a series of 1D and TOCSY spectra upon dissolution of a fully protonated peptide in 2H2O. 3 JHN-H coupling constants were measured from a DQFCOSY spectrum recorded at 298 K. 3JH-H coupling constants were determined from an ECOSY spectrum recorded at 281 K in 2H2O, transformed over the relevant spectral region to 8192 Â 1024 data points. Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo Workstation using XWIN-NMR (Bruker) and further analyzed using the program XEASY.25

Rat Vas Deferens
Electrically stimulated rat vas deferens bisected epididymal segments were used to establish concentration­response curves for MrIA-NH2 and truncated analogues as previously described.6 A shift in the methoxamine (0.1 M to 1 mM) on unstimulated rat vas deferens was used to identify 1-adrenoceptor activity. An ANOVA (Tukey test) was used to establish statistical significance (P < 0.05).

RESULTS
MrIA-NH2 gave good quality NMR spectra in aqueous solution at pH 3.5 and temperatures in the range 281­298 K. The spectra were assigned using the sequential assignment strategy.33 The presence of a strong NOE between the H-H protons for His11 and Hyp12, indicative of a predominant trans-peptide bond, is observed in the NOESY spectra. The spectra show a single spin system for each residue, except for Val3 and Cys13, for which ``brothered'' peaks are observed. These extra spin systems are consistent with the presence of a minor conformation likely to result from cis­trans isomerization of Hyp12. Further evidence supporting this is the observation that Cys4, Cys5, and His11 have slightly broadened peaks indi-

The H secondary shifts (i.e., the differences between the observed and random coil H NMR chemical shifts), NOE connectivities, and HN-H and H-H coupling data are summarized in Figures 1 and 2. The positive secondary shifts for the H resonances of residues 3­6 and 9­12 suggest that MrIA-NH2 contains -type structure. This suggestion is also supported by the coupling constant data, as residues 3­5 and 9­10 have large 3JHN-H coupling constants (!8.5 Hz) indicative of extended structures. Furthermore, long range NOEs characteristic of a ­hairpin were also observed, including N and NN NOEs between residues 5 and 11 and residues 6 and 11. Six amide protons are detectable in NMR spectra 10 min after dissolving the sample in D2O (residues 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11). Residue 4 is the slowest to exchange but is fully exchanged within 4 h.

ensemble, with a pairwise root mean square deviation ° (RMSD) of 1.22 A over the backbone atoms and 2.17 ° for all heavy atoms. The structures have no NOE A ° violations > 0.3 A and no dihedral violations > 38. The structures have good covalent geometry indicated by small deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles. Relevant geometric and energetic statistics, as well as Ramachandran plot statistics, are given in Table II. The family of MrIA-NH2 structures has higher RMSD values than is generally seen for the -conotoxins, which are of similar size and have two disulfide bonds.29,34 However the reduced precision appears to be mainly localized to the N-terminus, Cys13, and residues Gly6-Leu9. If the RMSD calculations are made for residues 3­5 and 10­12, the ° backbone RMSD decreases to 0.35 A. Figure 3 shows the backbone superposition of the representative ensemble, superimposed over residues 3­5 and 10­ 12, displaying the apparent flexible N-terminus and Gly6-Leu9 turn region. MrIA-NH2 adopts a ribbon-like fold, with residues 3­12 forming a -hairpin. The strands (residues 3­5 and 10­12) are connected by an inverse -turn comprising residues 6­8. The observed hydrogen bonds in the structures based on distances and angles are consistent with the amide protons that were slowly

Three-Dimensional Structure of MrIA-NH2
A total of 144 distance restraints (83 intraresidue, 47 sequential, 2 medium, and 12 long range) was obtained from the 500 and 750 MHz NMR data. Eight f angle restraints (­120 6 408 for Val3, Cys4, Cys5, Leu9, and Cys10, À100 6 808 for Cys13, 50 6 408 for Lys8, and ­60 6 308 for Tyr7) were derived from the DQF-COSY spectrum. The 1-dihedral angles (­60 6 308) for Cys4, Cys10, and Cys13 were derived from the ECOSY spectrum and the 150 ms NOESY spectrum. The -protons for these residues were also stereospecifically assigned. The NOEs and dihedral restraints were used in a torsion angle dynamics program using the program CNS26 to calculate a family of 50 structures. The 20 lowest energy structures were chosen as the final

exchanging (i.e., Gly6 HN ­ Leu9 CO, Leu9 HN ­ Tyr7 CO, His11 HN ­ Cys4 CO, Cys4 HN ­ His11 CO). Val3 and Cys10 were also slowly exchanging but Val3 is only predicted to hydrogen bond to the side chain of Asn1 in 2 of the 20 structures whereas Cys10 does not appear to be hydrogen bonded. The disulfide bond between Cys4 and Cys13 has a right handed hook conformation in 8 of 20 structures, and the disulfide bond between Cys5 and Cys10 has a short right-handed hook conformation in 14 of 20 structures. A ribbon representation of the secondary structure of MrIA-NH2 is presented in Figure 4.

pattern, structure calculations using both the -conopeptide (CysI-CysIV, CysII-CysIII) and the -conopeptide (CysI-CysIII, CysII-CysIV) disulfide bonding pattern were performed. The results clearly show that CysI-CysIV, CysII-CysIII is the preferred disulfide bonding pattern. The RMSD values, energies, and violations for the preferred disulfide connectivity are significantly lower than for the -conopeptide disulfide connectivity (Table II).

N-Terminally Truncated Analogues
Truncated analogues of MrIA were synthesized and oxidized using the conditions applied to the fulllength peptide. Three analogues were synthesized with residue 1 (MrIA-NH2[2-13]), residues 1 and 2 (MrIA-NH2[3-13]), and residues 1 to 3 (MrIANH2[4-13]) deleted respectively. An analysis of the secondary shifts of MrIA-NH2[2-13] and (MrIANH2[3-13]) compared to the native sequence is

Disulfide Connectivity
An examination of the NOE data for MrIA-NH2, shows that there are strong Cys4 H to Cys13 H and H NOEs as well as Cys5 H to Cys10 H NOEs, indicative of a Cys4-Cys13, Cys5-Cys10 bonding pattern.35 To confirm this disulfide-bonding

DISCUSSION
In the current study we have determined the solution structure of -conopeptide MrIA and shown it to predominately contain a -hairpin structure. MrIA has potential pharmaceutical applications because it inhibits the NET and the residues primarily responsible for this activity (i.e., residues 6­9) connect the two strands of the -hairpin. Residues 6 to 8 form an inverse -turn. Interestingly, residue 8 adopts a positive f angle, a conformation generally not found for nonglycine residues. The turn connecting the strands appears to have greater disorder than the remainder of the molecule, most likely reflecting structural flexibility in this region. The disulfide connectivity of MrIA has previously been examined using chemical methods6 and in the current study we have used NMR spectroscopy to confirm the ribbon connectivity of the disulfide bonds. NOEs indicative of the ribbon fold were observed between the side-chains of cysteine residues, but in small disulfide-rich bonded peptides such NOEs can be misleading36 and additional information was required to confirm the connectivity. Threedimensional structures of MrIA were calculated with the globular fold of the -conotoxins to assess the likelihood of this possibility. Both the NOE restraints and dihedral angle restraints violated significantly relative to the structures calculated with the ribbon con-

shown in Figure 1, from which it is clear that the overall fold is retained in the analogues. MrIANH2[4-13] has at least two conformations (for some residues four conformations are distinguishable) and therefore the resonances were not assigned (data not shown).

Effect on Rat Vas Deferens Contractility
-MrIA-NH2 was previously shown to enhance the NE-dependent second phase of the vas deferens contractile response to electrical stimuli (logIC50 ­6.4 6 0.13 M, n ¼ 4).6 MrIA-NH2[2-13] enhanced the contractile response similarly to MrIA-NH2 at concentrations up to 1 M. However, at concentrations above 1 M, the size of this enhancement diminished. At the highest concentration tested the size of the second phase was approximately 50% that of the maximal response observed for MrIA-NH2[2-13], while the initial response was enhanced by $ 30% (Figure 5). To identify whether this diminished response arose from 1-adrenoceptor inhibition, the influence of 10 M MrIA-NH2[2-13] was assessed on the methoxamine concentration responses. MrIA-NH2[2-13] shifted the control response of rat vas deferens to methoxamine (EC50 4.7 M) rightward by 3.7-fold (new EC50 17.3 M) without affecting the maximal response to methoxamine (data not shown). MrIANH2[3-13] was 3-fold less potent (logIC50 ­5.9 6 0.15 M, n ¼ 4) than MrIA-NH2 and produced a smaller maximal enhancement of control responses of 260 6 22% compared with a 380 6 36% enhancement of control responses produced by MrIA-NH2.

nectivity, as shown in Table II. The data unequivocally confirm the ribbon conformation for MrIA. The structure of MrIA appears to be more flexible than that previously reported for several -conotoxins,

which make up the main family of conotoxins containing two disulfide bonds. The RMSD values for MII and GI29,34 are both significantly lower than that obtained in the current study. This apparent flexibility is supported by the broadening of several resonances, most likely associated with intermediate exchange between multiple conformations. The ribbon connectivity of MrIA lacks the cross-bracing present in the globular fold and this is likely to be the major factor involved in the greater structural disorder. An analogous situation is apparent in three-disulfide­bonded peptides, where the cystine knot fold (CysI-CysIV, CysII-CysV, CysIIICysVI) appears to confer great stability and welldefined structures37 whereas the laddered connectivity, which contains a CysI-CysVI, CysII-CysV, and CysIIICysIV connectivity exhibits more disorder.38 The former is exemplified by a range of molecules including the plant cyclotides39 and the latter by the rhesus monkey -defensin RTD-1.38 Analogues of MrIA with truncated N-terminal residues suggest a link between these residues and the stabilization of the overall fold. Chemical shifts provide a very sensitive method of assessing structural changes and in particular the -proton shifts provide information about the backbone conformation. MrIA-NH2[2-13] and MrIA-NH2 [3-13] have very similar H shifts to native MrIA, suggesting that the overall fold is retained in the truncated molecules. Interestingly, multiple conformations were observed in the two-dimensional NMR spectra of MrIA-NH2,[4-13] indicating structural heterogeneity for this peptide. Alternative disulfide connectivities and cis­trans isomerization of Hyp12 may be responsible for this heterogeneity. The significant differences in the spectra of MrIA-NH2[4-13] compared to the native or other truncated forms suggest a critical structural role for Val3 in the structure of MrIA. Analysis of the structures of full-length MrIA reveals that the termini are in close proximity, evidenced by NOEs between Val3 and the C-terminal residues (Cys10-Cys13). In particular, the side-chain of Val3 is close to Hyp12 and this appears to provide a stabilizing hydrophobic interaction. It is interesting to note that the naturally occurring truncated version of MrIA, CMrVIA, also retains the N-terminal valine, providing further support for the importance of this residue. Overall, the interaction between the termini may stabilize the native fold and consequently N-terminal truncations destabilize the structure. The current study has also shown CMrVIA maintains the overall fold of MrIA based on chemical shift analysis. The activity of the N-terminally truncated analogues of MrIA was determined on the contractile response of electrically stimulated rat vas deferens. These studies reveal that the truncated analogue

MrIA-NH2[2-13] has additional pharmacology associated with a reduction in the size of the second phase of the contractile response at concentrations above 1 M. This diminished response does not arise from inhibition of transmitter release or a nonspecific reduction in vas deferens responsiveness, as the initial contractile response arising from ATP release was enhanced at these high concentrations. This effect is reminiscent of the -conopeptides, which inhibit the second component of the contractile response through the inhibition of 1-adrenoceptors.6 The ability of MrIA-NH2[2-13] to inhibit the 1-adrenoceptor responses in the rat vas deferens was confirmed by its ability to inhibit methoxamine responses in a competitive manner. In contrast, MrIA-NH2[3-13] effects were restricted to the second phase of contraction, where it was $ 3-fold less potent and $ 30% less efficacious than MrIA-NH2, but these differences did not reach significance. In preliminary studies, MrIA-NH2[4-13] produced < 20% enhancement of responses at concentrations up to 10 M, indicating that Val3 is required for optimal -conopeptide activity. The alanine scan previously performed on MrIA revealed only minor structural differences for all residues that were mutated to alanines with the exception of Gly6. Significant chemical shift perturbations were observed when this residue was replaced with an alanine.9 Although glycine residues are much more likely to adopt positive f angles than other residues, this is not the case for this residue in MrIA. Therefore, the structural perturbation observed upon substitution of an alanine is likely to be directly related to the size of the side-chain rather than the requirement of the generally unfavorable positive backbone f angle in this turn. The importance of this residue is further reflected in its complete conservation throughout the known -conopeptides (Table I). In summary, the three-dimensional structure of MrIA-NH2 has been determined using NMR. MrIANH2 adopts a ribbon-like fold with a -hairpin linked by an apparently flexible turn between residues 6 and 9. Interactions between Val3 and the C-terminal residues and studies of truncated analogues indicate the N-terminal residues, in particular Val3, play a role in the peptide adopting a stable conformation. Truncating the N-terminal tail influenced the pharmacology of -conopeptides.
