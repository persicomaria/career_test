SUMMARY. We have prepared and purified the amino terminal fragment (ATF) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), as well as the kringle and the growth factor domain (GFD) of which it is composed. Structural studies on these materials are currently under way. In addition, we have demonstrated that either the ATF or its GFD portion can inhibit tumour cell invasion in vitro, and that both can likewise act as mitogens and induce differentiation in certain cell lines. Our results also suggest that the fucose attached to Thrl8 may be essential for at least some of these activities, since defucosylated GFD becomes inactive in mitogenesis. Clearly the ATF has activities beyond simply anchoring u-PA to the cell surface. Availability of separated, purified domains will allow both structural and functional dissection of these activities.

Urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) is a multidomain serine protease which has been implicated in numerous normal and pathological physiological processes (e.g., tissue remodelling, fertilization, fibrinolysis, and tumour metastasis).` .' .` In addition to the catalytically active B-chain. u-PA also contains an enzymatically inactive A-chain. which can be further subdivided into a growth factor-like domain (GFD) and a single kringle domain. u-PA fragments containing both a GFD and a kringle domain are referred to as amino terminal fragments (ATF). Recent reports suggest the participation of the GFD in binding to a specific u-PA receptor (u-PA-r),` .' the presence of which has been demonstrated on numerous cell types.6 Binding of u-PA (via the GFD) to the u-PA receptor serves to localize and polarize u-PA activity to the cell surface7.x and sequesters this activity from plasminogen activator inhibitors. which may be compartmentalized within the extracellular matrix. In addition, recent reports suggest both paracrine' and autocrine"' roles for u-PA. which also appear to be modulated by interaction of the non-catalytic domains with a specific u-PA receptor. However. it is not known whether the receptor involved in localization of u-PA activity to the cell surface is the same as that which mediates signal transduction.

We have isolated the individual domains of u-PA. This has allowed for the reconstitution of the activity of the u-PA domains in vitro (see, for example, contributions by Goltzman. Boyd, Nusrat and Barnathan in this supplement), as well as for structural studies to be performed on the isolated domains. We describe here the preparation and characterization of the GFD, kringle, and amino-terminal fragments (ATF) from u-PA.

MATERIALS Materials

AND METHODS

Abbott pro-u-PA (A76137) expressed and purified from SP2/0 cell culture" was used as the starting material for all proteolytic preparations. Lys-plasminogen and low molecular weight (LMW) u-PA (Abbokinase) were also from Abbott labs. LMW u-PA was further purified by affinity chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose.`" Endo-Glu (Staph V8) protease was from Worthington Biochemical Corp. PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), CNBr-activated Sepharose 6B, and benzamidine-Sepharose 6B were purchased from Sigma. Anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA. sequencing grade) was from Pierce Chemicals (Rockford. IL). S-2251 was from KabiVitrum. A monoclonal antibody directed against the u-PA kringle was obtained from Abbott Biotech (Needham, MA).

of Plasmin

Lys-plasminogen (lOmg/ml in 24mM Tris-HCV 25 mM lysine pH 8.5) was incubated with LMW u-PA (1450 units u-PA per 34.8mg lys-plasminogen or 25OO:l molar ratio of plasminogen:u-PA) at room Generation of plasmin was monitored temperature. by S-2251 hydrolysis. Peak plasmin activity was observed at 15min under these conditions: longer incubation times showed a gradual decrease in plasmin activity, presumably due to autolysis. The activation reaction was therefore quenched at 15min by addition of 10% acetic acid (1:6 dilution). Plasmin concentration was determined by active site titration using PNPGB.

The capacity of the derivatized resin was at least 2mg HMW u-PA bound per ml resin. ATF, kringle, and HMW u-PA, but not GFD or LMW u-PA were able to bind to the resin.

Immobilization

of Plasminogen

Immobilization of lys-plasminogen was essentially as previously described. " Approximately 90mg of lysplasminogen was completely immobilized to 5g dry CNBr-Sepharose (7.2mg plasminogen/ml swollen resin). We estimated the concentration of active sites per ml resin by first activating the immobilized plasminogen with urokinase (100 units u-PA per 100~1 immobilized plasminogen, 45 min at room temperature) in TNTH buffer (50mM Tris-HCl/ 1OOmM NaCl/O.l% human serum albumin/O.Ol% Tween-80 pH 8.0) then comparing the activity of the immobilized plasmin to a standard curve generated using lab standard plasmin. The active site concentration of the immobilized plasmin was determined to be 15 FM. S-2251 activity by the plasminogen-Sepharose could not be detected in the absence of a u-PA activation step. Both immobilized plasminogen and the immobilized monoclonal antibody were stored in PBS with 0.05% azide.

N-Terminal Sequencing, Amino Acid Composition, and Plasma Desorption Mass Spectrometry (PDMS) N-terminal sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 470 sequencer. A Beckman 6300 was used for all amino acid composition analysis. All

Pro-u-PA (40ml at 5 mg/ml) was dialyzed against two 1: 100 changes of 0.1 M sodium phosphate/O.4M NaCl pH 7.8 overnight at 4°C. Endo-Glu protease (5mg/ml) was added to a final concentration of O.l25mg/ml (pro-u-PA: Endo-Glu molar ratio of 20: 1) and incubated at 37°C for 6 h. The reaction was quenched by addition of PMSF to a final concentration of lOOpM, and the reaction mixture concentrated to a final volume of 5ml or less. The concentrated preparation was then applied to a 250ml Sephadex G-50 column (2.5x50cm) equilibrated with PBS at 4"C, and developed at a flow rate of 0.25mVmin with this same buffer. Typically, 2ml fractions were collected and assayed for absorbance at 280nm. The front l/3 (pool 1) and the back 2/3 (pool 2) of peak 3 were usually pooled separately. Pool 2 contained only GFD, whereas pool 1 contained some free kringle in addition to the GFD (Fig. 1). The immobilized monoclonal antibody resin was used to remove contaminating kringle species from pool 1. Pool 1 treated in this manner was homogeneous for GFD, and was combined with pool 2. Unfortunately, the kringle species immunopurified in this manner contained a second proteolytic cut after Glu53. The fucosylation of u-PA at Thrl8 has been reported. ".I' We were unable to remove this fucose available fucosidases. Therefore, using commercially roles of the in order to test for possible physiological fucose, we developed a chemical method for removing fucose from the GFD. GFD was dialyzed or into 1OOmM citrate pH 7.0 (phosphate desalted containing buffers interfered with the defucosylation)

clear indication of defucosylation by the appearance of a second mass peak 146 mass units lower than the fucosylated GFD. In most defucosylated samples, only the defucosylated peak (and none of the fucosylated starting material) was observed by PDMS. Interestingly, we also observed some defucosylated material which co-eluted with the tail end of the kringle peak (peak 2) when we assayed the G-50 column fractions by PDMS. However, this naturally defucosylated GFD appeared to be only a minor component, and we did not further pursue its isolation.

The GFD powder was dried further in the reaction tube by placing it overnight in a dessicatol under vacuum. Anhydrous TFA (1 .Oml) was added to the reaction tube and the tube sealed immediately under nitrogen. The sealed tube was subsequently incubated for 30min in a 70°C waterbath. then immediately placed on ice to cool. The cooled GFD in TFA was then transferred to a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube, dried in a Speed Vat. reconstituted with water and dried again to remove any traces of TFA. Final reconstitution of the defucosylated GFD was back into PBS. We were able to assay fucosylated and defucosylated GFD domains by PDMS (Fig. 2a and 2b).

Purified recombinant pro-u-PA was radiolabelled with Na' I using Iodo-beads *` (Pierce Chemical Co.. Rockford, IL) as previously described." Radiolabelled pro-u-PA was diluted in Dulbecco' s phoshate buffered saline (supplemented with calcium and Gibco) containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum magnesium: albumin (Sigma) (PBS-BSA). To measure binding, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and passaged 3-5 times as previously described in Medium 199 supplemented with 10% FBS, endothelial growth factor, and antibiotics." The cells were plated on fibronectin coated 96-well plates and allowed to come to confluence overnight in the presence of 1OOnM phorbol myristate acetate. The HUVECs were then cooled to 4°C and washed 3 times with PBS-BSA buffer. Labelled pro-u-PA (5 nM) was added for 3 h at 4°C in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabelled competitors. including pro-uPA, GFD with fucose, and GFD without fucose.

temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding aprotinin to a final concentration of 20pM and filtering the reaction mixture immediately to remove the resin. The filtrate was applied to a freshly poured benzamidine-Sepharose column (1 X 40) equilibrated with 100nM citrate pH 7.0 at 4°C at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. The column was washed with this same buffer until protein absorbance could no longer be detected in the flow through fraction. The buffer system was then switched to O.lM sodium acetate/ 0.4M NaCl pH 4.0, and the bound u-PA eluted. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and diluted to approximately 1.5mg/ml with the acetate buffer, then dialyzed against two 1:lOO changes of 0.1 M sodium phosphate/0.6M NaCV4 FM aprotinin pH 7.6 using a 25 kD MWCO membrane. After dialysis, the u-PA (further diluted to 1.2mg/ml with phosphate buffer) was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 5.5 days, at which time it was once again applied to a freshly equilibrated benzamidine-Sepharose column as described above. The flow-through was collected in 7 ml fractions, and all protein-containing fractions were pooled. Further purification of the ATF could be achieved using reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) on a C8 resin, which was capable of separating intact ATF from ATF cleaved after Lvs23 (tig.3). -

comprise as much as 30% of the total protein. A second chromatographic step using a G-50 gel filtration column (as described previously) allowed the isolation of homogeneous kringle. Preparation of an ATF by Autodigestion of u-PA

Plasminogen-Sepharose was activated by adding 100 units of u-PA per 1 ml settled volume plasminogenSepharose in TNTH buffer and incubating on a rocker for 45 min at room temperature. The plasminSepharose generated in this manner was filtered (using a 20ml syringe and a 0.2 pm Gelman Acrodisc filter) and washed with 10 volumes cold TNTH buffer, then added to lml pro-u-PA (3.56mg/ml in 0.15M sodium phosphate/O.l4MNaCl pH 7.4). Activation of pro-u-PA was monitored by S-2444 as previously described. A total of 70% activation was achieved after 11 min under these conditions, and this was chosen as the endpoint for pro-u-PA activation in the hope of avoiding secondary plasmin catalyzed cleavage within the A-chain of u-PA. The pro-u-PA activation was scaled up (7ml of plasmin-Sepharose added to 72.56ml of 3.56mg/ml pro-u-PA) and incubated for 15 min on a rocker table at room

The amino terminal sequences and the predicted and determined (by mass spectrometry) molecular weights of the various u-PA domains appear in Table 1. Using this information, we have been able to define the termini of the u-PA domains generated under the conditions of proteolysis used to prepare these modules. The GFD consists of amino acids (aa) 4-43 plus the molecular mass of a single fucose, which has been identified at Thrl8. The kringle domain prepared by plasmin digest consists of aa 47-135(136), which is consistent with two plasmin cleavage sites

occurring between aa 46-47 and 135-136. There is some uncertainty as to whether the C-terminal amino acid is Lys135 or Lys136. We have been unsuccessful in sequencing the C terminus of the unreduced kringle, perhaps due to the proximity of the last disulfide hindering access of carboxypeptidase B to the C terminal. We are presently attempting to resolve the identity of the C-terminal amino acid by using a reduced, alkylated kringle for these studies. The preparation and characterization of the ATF by autolysis of u-PA has been somewhat prepared enigmatic. We originally attempted to reproduce the preparation of the ATF (aa 1-135) described by Bogusky et al."' However. in our hands, 6(b70% of the ATF molecules generated contained a second proteolytic cut after Lys23. which was not inhibited by relatively high concentrations of aprotinin (4 FM or 200 KIUlml) Progressively decreasing the concentration of u-PA increased the yield of single chain 1.2mgim1, greater than 95% ATF. At approximately of the ATF was in the single chain form. Homogeneous single chain ATF could be obtained by purification using reverse phase HPLC on a C8 column. PDMS of the ATF demonstrated a molecular mass consistent with an ATF consisting of aa 6-135 rather than the expected l-135. In addition. N-terminal sequencing consistently detected only 5-10% of the ATF provided. In fact, the aprotinin N-terminal

sequence consistently predominated in the sequence analysis even though the concentration of the ATF exceeded the concentration of aprotinin by at least 2O-fold. We suspected that somehow the first five amino acids of the ATF were removed. followed by a cyclization of the newly formed N-terminal glutamine to a pyro-glutamate. Indeed, upon separating the ATF from aprotinin, we detected several sequences: (a) Ser-Asn-Glu, consistent with aa 1-3; (b) Leu-His. aa 4-5; and (c) a small amount of the sequence Gln-Val-Pro-Ser . ., consistent with aa 6 onward. However. the molar amounts of the sequence did not coincide with the amount of protein determined to bc in the sample by composition analysis. This was not surprising for small peptides like aa l-3 and 4-5. since small peptides have a tendency to be washed off the solid support used in sequencing. However, the low sequencing yield of the 6-135 peptide indicated the presence of a blocked N-terminal. We attempted to deblock this N-terminal using pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase without success. In addition, we have not been able to identify the activity responsible for ATF prepared in this manner is this conversion. stable indefinitely at 4°C at pH 4.5. However, slow cleavage after Lys23 occurs even at -20°C when the ATF is stored at pH 7.0. HPLC purified ATF is completely stable at pH 7.0 at both 4°C and -20°C. SDS-PAGE analysis of the GFD. kringle, and ATF under both reduced and non-reduced conditions demonstrates the presence of a single band for each species (Fig. 4). Since the CJFD tends to migrate with the dye front. we have further examined its purity by RP-HPLC (Fig. 4). In addition, we have been able to isolate both intact GFD and kringle from a V8 digest of pro-u-PA using C8 RP-HPLC. Although greater than 50% of the kringle generated in this manner is cleaved after Glu53. reverse phase chromatography is able to separate the cleaved kringle from the intact kringle with relatively good resolution (data not shown). This method generates two contiguous A-chain fragments. the GFD (aa 4-43) and the kringle (aa 44-143). Comparison of ATF(6135) and ATF(I-143)

In addition to preparation of ATF by autocatalysis, the preparation of ATF by a recently identified metalloprotease is described by Marcotte et al elsewhere in this supplement. Both ATF molecules have been utilized extensively in cell binding experiments and appear to be equivalent."`." Comparison of Fucosylated and Defucosylated GFD

Since the preparation of the defucosylated GFD involves an incubation in neat TFA. we were concerned as to the integrity of the defucosylated GFD after deglycosylation. The defucosylation of the GFD is monitored by PDMS. Although mass spectrometry is essentially non-quantitative. in this instance we are

54 Domains of u-PA A We have also recently attempted to defucosylate the ATF(l-143), and find that although we are able to achieve defucosylation within the GFD, the treatment of ATF with neat TFA chemically modifies this fragment. The mass of the ATF is observed to be -500 mass units greater than would be expected for the defucosylated ATF moiety. Limited proteolysis of the TFA-treated ATF with V8 protease generates a GFD of molecular weight 4471 Da, which demonstrates that defucosylation is achieved, and indicates that modification of the ATF occurs within the kringle. We are presently trying to identify the nature of this modification. Extinction Co-efficients of u-PA Domains

comparing essentially the same compounds except that one is lacking in fucose. It is likely that since the composition of both the fucosylated and defucosylated GFDs is the same, they will desorb to the same extent under PDMS conditions. Therefore, the ratio of the fucosylated to the defucosylated peaks gives a reasonable estimate of the relative amounts of each. By this criterion, defucosylation appears to go very nearly to completion (Fig. 2b). We had hoped to be able to separate the fucosylated and defucosylated by RP-HPLC, which would allow GFD domains quantitation of the two species. However, even under very shallow gradient conditions, the peaks of the fucosylated and defucosylated GFD could not be resolved. This indicated that defucosylation did little to change the chemical composition and/or conformation of the GFD. Furthermore, when we sequenced through the majority of the GFD, only one N-terminal was detected, and all the asparagines, were intact. We were not able to sequence as far as Gln40, and therefore could not be sure whether this amide was intact. However. the defucosylated and fucosylated GFD were both equivalent in competing with HMW u-PA for binding to HUVECs (Fig. 6), which indicates that the defucosylated GFD is structurally intact with respect to receptor binding.

We have determined the extinction coefficients for each of the isolated domains of u-PA, as well as for HMW u-PA, and compared them to the theoretically derived values determined by the method of Gill and 3 There was good agreement between von Hippel.` the theoretical values and our own experimentally derived values. We determined the extinction co-efficients using amino acid composition analysis on duplicate (and in some cases, triplicate) samples of known absorbance values. Samples were loaded into pyrogen free tubes and dried, then reconstituted in sample was 6N HCl. A portion of the reconstituted taken to determine the saved and a UV spectrum amount of protein recovered after drying and reconstitution. In all cases, less than 5% of the initial absorbance was lost due to handling. Nevertheless, extinction co-efficients were determined based on the absorbance reading of the reconstituted sample, rather than the initial sample. Compositions for basic, hydrophobic, acidic (Gln. Asn, Glu, and Asp), and polar residues were averaged to obtain the average moles of the domain of interest. and were normalized relative to the absorbance reading for that sample to determine the extinction coefficient. The results are presented in Table 2.

DHCUSSION We have prepared, purified, and characterized the various domains of u-PA. This will allow direct assay of the various activities of these domains and aid in structural studies. Presently. we are investigating the structure of the various u-PA domains by NMR, fluorescence. CD, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In addition, we have demonstrated that the GFD or the ATF can inhibit tumour cell invasion in vitro,24 and that the GFD and the ATF can act as mitogens and induce differentiation in certain cell lines in the absence of the catalytic domain.` ,`" Our results also suggest that the fucosyl-threonine in the GFD may act as a molecular trigger, at least in the case of mitogenic effects, since GFD with fucose removed loses this activity.2' The physiological role of u-PA is complex, and it appears that each domain of u-PA may have distinct roles in different biological processes. Clearly. the N-terminus of u-PA has evolved not only to anchor the catalytic domain to the cell surface, but also to have true growth factor activity. These activities may be reconstituted using purified u-PA domains, and dissected both functionally (i.e., in cell culture) and structurally (i.e., through interaction of u-PA domains with the u-PA receptor).
