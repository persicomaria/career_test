A number of small, basic proteins penetrate into the structure of the large subunit of the ribosome. While these proteins presumably aid in the folding of the rRNA, the extent of their contribution to the stability or function of the ribosome is unknown. One of these small, basic proteins is L36, which is highly conserved in Bacteria, but is not present in Archaea or Eucarya. Comparison of ribosome crystal structures shows that the space occupied by L36 in a bacterial ribosome is empty in an archaeal ribosome. To ask what L36 contributes to ribosome stability and function, we have constructed an Escherichia coli strain lacking ribosomal protein L36; cell growth is slowed by 40­50% between 30 8C and 42 8C. Ribosomes from this deletion strain sediment normally and have a full complement of proteins, other than L36. Chemical protection experiments comparing rRNA from wild-type and L36-deficient ribosomes show the expected increase in reagent accessibility in the immediate vicinity of the L36 binding site, but suggest that a cooperative network of rRNA tertiary interactions has been ° disrupted along a path extending 60 A deep into the ribosome. These data argue that L36 plays a significant role in organizing 23 S rRNA structure. Perhaps the Archaea and Eucarya have compensated for their lack of L36 by maintaining more stable rRNA tertiary contacts or by adopting alternative protein­RNA interactions elsewhere in the ribosome.

Introduction
Ribosomes consist of three RNA molecules and 50­80 proteins. Although the highly conserved functional regions of the ribosome consist mostly of RNA,1 many of the ribosomal proteins have been highly conserved across all three phylogenetic domains as well.2 Thus, some ribosomal proteins must have been selected to optimize ribosome function in specific ways, which might include prevention of RNA misfolding, promotion of RNA conformational changes during the translation cycle, and stabilization of the structure of the ribosome. One example of how ribosomal proteins have been optimized for a specific function is suggested by the prevalence of small, basic proteins that

penetrate into the rRNA structure of the 50 S subunit.3 The role of these proteins is presumably to aid in the folding of rRNA; however, the extent of their contribution is not known. In order to specifically address the contribution a small, basic protein has in the ribosome, the role of one ribosomal protein, L36, will be examined in this work. L36 is the smallest bacterial ribosomal protein;4 it has a zinc-ribbon-like fold consisting of a small b-sheet and is highly basic (Figure 1).5 As can be seen in the Deinococcus radiodurans 50 S crystal structure,6 L36 is surrounded by several highly conserved functional regions of 23 S rRNA, including helices which stem off the peptidyl transferase center (helices 89 and 91), the L10-L11 binding domain (domain II), and the four-helix junction containing the sarcin-ricin loop (helix 95). From its position crosslinking helices 89 and 91, L36 sits on the divide between two symmetry-related regions extending out from the peptidyl transferase center.7

L36 is a highly conserved bacterial protein found in all branches of eubacteria as well as in mitochondria and chloroplasts.8 Alignments of L36 sequences illustrate that basic residues (12 Arg and Lys in Escherichia coli) tend to be conserved. In addition, the CCCH zinc-binding motif is conserved in w75% of the 160 completed bacterial genomes in which L36 was found and in all known mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences. Although L36 is conserved in bacteria, it is not present in archaeal or eucaryal genomes.8 Examination of 50 S subunit crystal structures from an Archaea and a Bacteria shows that the space occupied by L36 in the bacterial structure is empty in the archaeal structure (Figure 1). These observations lead to the question of how important L36 is for ribosome function: might it make such a marginal contribution that Archaea and Eucarya have not retained an equivalent protein, or might it serve an important role which Eucarya and Archaea have achieved by alternative means. To ask what role L36 plays in the ribosome in bacteria, an E. coli strain lacking ribosomal protein L36 was constructed. Removal of L36 from the ribosome affects ribosome function strongly and causes extensive disruptions of the rRNA tertiary structure. The disruptions extend from the surface to deep within the ribosome, suggesting that the rRNA fold is highly cooperative and relies on the strategic placement of positive charges for its maintenance. We argue from these data that L36 has a specific and important role in the organization of the 23 S rRNA, and speculate that Archaea and Eucarya have used other means to achieve the same degree of stabilization.

Results
Construction and characterization of rpmJD6-35 rpmJ, the gene encoding L36, is the last gene in the spc operon, but the downstream alpha operon is closely linked to the spc operon.9 The majority of the alpha operon transcripts originate from the spc operon promoter.10 In fact, no clear termination site of the spc operon has been determined.11 In order to avoid disruption of potential signals for transcriptional or translational coupling of the spc and alpha operon, an E. coli strain, rpmJD6-35, was constructed in which the bases coding for the first five and the last three amino acid residues of the rpmJ gene were maintained on the chromosome using the method of Link and co-workers12 (Figure 2). Synthesis of the shortened peptide, MKVRARQG, presumably allows for transcriptional coupling and translational read through. rpmJD6-35 showed 40­50% slower growth than wild-type at temperatures from 30 to 42 8C in LB broth (Table 1). A plasmid encoding rpmJ under the control of an inducible Ptac promoter was transformed into the deletion strain. At all three temperatures, the wild-type growth rate was O85% recoverable by addition of L36 in trans, indicating that the absence of L36 protein is the primary cause of the defective cell growth (Table 1). The distributions of polysomes, ribosomes, and ribosomal subunits separated on sucrose gradients were compared for wild-type and rpmJD6-35 cells grown to mid-log phase at 37 8C (Figure 3). Although the amount of 70 S ribosomes was the same in the wild-type and deletion strain there were

present in the same relative amounts as wild-type control ribosomes (data not shown). Because of the size and charge of L36, it is difficult to visualize L36 in the presence of the other ribosomal proteins on standard two-dimensional gels. It was possible to confirm the absence of L36 from the ribosome by using an 18% polyacrylamide gel with Tris-tricine/ urea buffer (Figure 4).13

proportionally more subunits and fewer polysomes in the rpmJD6-35 strain. Additional peaks, which might suggest the accumulation of defective 50 S assembly intermediates are not detected. It is difficult to quantify the relative amounts of free 30 S and 50 S subunits, because of the proximity of these peaks to the large amount of UV-absorbing material at the top of the gradient; however, it does not appear that there is any relative deficiency in the amount of 50 S subunits. The correct assembly of rpmJD6-35 ribosomes is further confirmed by two-dimensional gel analysis of ribosomal proteins extracted from isolated rpmJD6-35 ribosomes; all proteins besides L36 are

439 interact with RNA regions that had shown reactivity using the first primers. Together, these primers probe about a third of the 23 S rRNA, including the L11 binding region, the sarcin­ricin loop, and half of the peptidyl transferase center (Figures 6 and 7(b)). Comparison of the reactivity of wild-type and DL36 ribosomes in DMS and hydroxyl radical reactions showed many protections and a few enhancements in reagent accessibility due to the presence of L36. These changes in reactivity were quantified by superimposing normalized peak profiles from wild-type and DL36 ribosomes; an example of a sequencing gel and peak profile alignment is shown in Figure 5. In order to be unbiased, relative peak heights were extracted from these profiles for four to seven replicate experiments and the values were compared to determine statistically significant changes (see Materials and Methods). The data are shown as the ratio of peak heights for DL36 ribosomes and wild-type; a value greater than 1 means L36 protects that nucleotide from the reagent. The peak heights were not

Structural probing of ribosomes with and without L36 Ribosomes extracted from rpmJD6-36 and wildtype strains were used in structure-probing experiments to examine rRNA in ribosomes with and without L36. Ribosomes extracted from rpmJD6-35 are called DL36 ribosomes. Two types of structural probing reagents were used, dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and hydroxyl radicals. DMS is a basespecific chemical probe that reacts primarily with N7-G, N1-A, and N3-C at neutral pH.14 Hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction abstract protons from the ribose ring, leading to the cleavage of the sugar and strand scission. After extractions of the rRNA from the ribosomes, primer extension of the reacted RNA was performed with five primers specific to the 23 S rRNA. The first primers were chosen to target the four RNA hairpins potentially contacting L36 in the D. radiodurans 50 S crystal structure (PDB 1NKW),6 and then additional primers were chosen to expand probing to regions of RNA that interact with the L36 binding site or

corrected for differences between wild-type and DL36 ribosome control lanes, as only two regions are significantly affected by taking into account control lanes (see below). Data for both reagents are summarized in Table 2. Nucleotides of the 23 S rRNA that may directly contact L36 were identified by determining which ° bases are within 6 A of the L36 backbone in the D. radiodurans 50 S crystal structure (PDB 1NKW). (Protein side-chains have not been assigned in the D. radiodurans structure,6 limiting the determination of direct contacts of L36.) These possible contacts have been mapped on the 23 S secondary structure and displayed on the 50 S crystal structure (Figures 6 and 7). Four regions have been identified as possible direct contacts: helices 89 and 91, which stem from the peptidyl transferase center, bases in the stalk that binds L10/(L12)4, and helix 97 in the four-helix junction containing the sarcin-ricin loop. Helix numbering is as described by Leffers et al.15 As expected, removal of L36 from the ribosome caused greater reactivity in 23 S rRNA nucleotides that are in the immediate vicinity of L36. Three of the four possible contact regions described above are protected extensively by L36. Of these three regions, nucleotides within loops in helices 89 and 91 were cleaved significantly in the DL36 control lanes that lack reagent, suggesting that the removal of L36 makes these RNA regions more susceptible

to nuclease within the cell. The fourth region, helix 97, has only one protection, but the crystal structure indicates that it has less potential for direct contacts with L36. In addition to seeing effects in areas of the rRNA that are close enough to make direct contacts with L36, a number of nucleotides were identified whose accessibility is affected indirectly by L36 removal. Although these nucleotides are in different secondary structure domains of the 23 S rRNA, they are linked to the L36 binding region by tertiary contacts identified in the D. radiodurans 50 S structure (Figure 6). It appears that these reactive nucleotides identify networks of tertiary interactions that are disrupted by the removal of L36 (see Discussion).

Discussion
Ribosomal proteins have been described as the "mortar filling the gaps and cracks between the RNA bricks."1 L36 is a perfect example of "mortar" for the ribosome. The protein is small (38 amino acid residues in E. coli) and highly basic (w30% arginine or lysine); most of its sequence positions are nearly invariant. These properties, and the fact that it fits a specific niche in the ribosome surrounded by rRNA emanating from different functional centers, suggest that it has been tuned by

selection to fulfil a specific role in the ribosome. Its location and basic charge would argue that it could be an important factor stabilizing RNA tertiary interactions in this region (Figure 1). The structure and conservation of L36 do not give any insight into the extent to which the ribosome relies on L36 for proper assembly or function. Even an interaction that enhances ribosome efficiency by less than 1% could become highly conserved over time but would be undetectable in vitro. Thus, the goal of the present work was to assess the magnitude of the structural and functional defects that might result from omission of L36 from 50 S subunits. To accomplish this goal, an E. coli strain lacking L36 (rpmJD6-35) was constructed; the cell growthrate decreased by w40%, but recovered to near wild-type growth rates by addition of L36 in trans. The lack of the protein itself is, therefore, the cause of the growth defect, rather than disruption of gene expression from the ribosomal protein operon. Ribosomes isolated from rpmJD6-35 bacteria showed a full complement of the remaining ribosomal proteins and sedimented normally in sucrose gradients. Therefore, ribosome assembly

has not been disrupted grossly by the lack of L36. Elevated levels of subunits relative to polysomes hint that DL36 ribosomal subunits are less strongly associated or initiate less frequently than wild-type. These results suggest that 50 S subunits assembled in the absence of L36 are functionally defective to a significant extent but are not grossly defective in terms of assembly. Obviously, there is a strong selective pressure to maintain L36 as part of the complement of bacterial ribosomal proteins. Our main focus in this study is the effect of L36 on rRNA structure. To approach this question, ribosomes from wild-type and L36-minus strains were probed with DMS and hydroxyl radicals. The absence of L36 caused increased solvent-accessibility of the rRNA surrounding L36, as expected. However, the surprising result of these studies is that the structural consequences of removing L36 ° extend deep into the ribosome on a w60 A path from the surface of the ribosome to the peptidyl transferase center (Figure 7). Most of the nucleotides whose reactivity is altered by L36 appear to be linked closely to RNA­RNA tertiary contacts. We propose that these tertiary interactions define

a pathway along which perturbations are propagated when L36 is absent during ribosome assembly. The extensive nature of the changes to ribosomal structure caused by the omission of L36 argues that the ribosome structure is highly cooperative in this region. Three examples of structural disruptions found in DL36 ribosomes at progressively more distant locations from the L36 binding site are shown in Figure 8. First, the extrahelical bulge conformation of U1033 may be stabilized by a potential interaction of its phosphate group with Arg18 of L36. This conformation of U1033 is necessary for its stacking with A2750 of helix 97 (Figure 8(a)). In the absence of any interaction with L36, U1033 may be positioned less precisely and allow the hairpin loop containing A2750 to adopt an alternative conformation in which A2750 is less reactive towards DMS (Table 2). Second, a set of tertiary contacts between the sarcin­ricin loop (SRL, helix 95) and helix 91 could be strengthened by L36 (Figure 8(b)). L36 binds across the base of the helix 91 hairpin loop and probably helps stabilize an S-turn in 2528­2530 that points G2529 away from the helix. The four remaining loop bases (A2531­A2534) are stacked and hydrogen-bonded in the minor groove of the SRL. Removal of L36 could destabilize the stacked structure of the helix 91 loop and weaken its interaction with the SRL, thus accounting for the increased reactivity of two SRL nucleotides. A third example of tertiary structure disruptions is seen in the contacts of helices 90-91-92 with helix 71 (Figure 8(c)). The 90-91-92 three helix junction folds into a compact structure linked by hydrogen bonds at the junction itself and between the loop of

hairpin 92 and the 3 0 terminus of helix 90. L36 binds immediately adjacent to one of these tertiary contacts, in which U2514 intercalates between A2541 and A2542. The backbone 5 0 to U2514 is hydrogen bonded to backbone in the 2562­2566 loop. The increased solvent-accessibility seen in most of these regions of tertiary interactions in DL36 ribosomes suggest that L36-induced stabilization of nearby tertiary structure cooperatively stabilizes the entire network of interactions. (The lack of reported changes in the reactivity of A2541, A2542, and U2514 does not rule out the disruption of their intercalated conformation for at least two reasons: (i) we have used a conservative 20% level of change as a minimum for including a nucleotide in Table 2, and may be missing many subtle changes; (ii) bases are likely to remain stacked when in a disrupted conformation, e.g. A2541 would stack with A2542 in the absence of U2514, and thus minimize the change in solvent-accessibility.) Helix 71 contacts helix 92 and the helix 90-91-92 junction; the dramatic increase in helix 71 accessibility to hydroxyl radical could thus be the result of helix 90-91-92 misfolding. The way in which L36 is linked to the structures shown in Figure 8 is necessarily speculative with the information available. L36 may add thermodynamic stability to the tertiary interactions, in which case the disrupted structures are the equilibrium folds that are stable in the absence of the protein. Alternatively, if L36 helps guide the assembly process by increasing the rate of correct RNA folding relative to the rates of forming incorrect structures, the RNA could become trapped in misfolded conformations during ribosome assembly. In either case, it is striking that we do not observe isolated structural changes in the

L36 Organizes rRNA Tertiary Structure in Bacteria

443 Examination of the structural consequences of removing L36 leaves the question of how L36 may affect the function of the ribosome. As we have seen, L36 appears to hold local rRNA elements (helices 42, 89, 91, and 97) together. One of these elements, the rRNA stem binding L10 (helix 42), is directly connected to the L11-binding region, which has been implicated in binding elongation factors.16,17 Additionally, these biochemical and cryo-electron microscope studies show that the sarcin-ricin loop, a region affected indirectly by removing L36, may contact the elongation factors as well. Thus, L36 removal may affect proper positioning of rRNA regions interacting with factors and therefore the function of the factors that bind these RNAs. This could result in a lowered ribosome efficiency, leading to slowed growth. Additionally, the ability of the subunits to associate may be affected, since helix 71, one of the intersubunit contacts, is affected by the removal of L36.18 Although it is clear that functionally important regions of the ribosome have been disrupted as a result of omitting L36, fully understanding how these disruptions translate into effects on ribosome function awaits further studies. Other studies have examined the roles of basic ribosomal proteins within the ribosome. In one study, the tail extensions of L4 and L22, which penetrate into the ribosome, were found to be dispensable.19 However, two other studies found results similar to those presented here. Mutations in yeast L3 caused an effect on the rRNA structure of ° the large subunit w100 A away from L3, and resulted in impaired cell growth and peptidyl transferase activity.20 In another study, the tail extension of ribosomal protein L20 was found to be essential for normal subunit assembly.21 While these studies show results similar to those observed when L36 is not present in the ribosome, the results might have been anticipated on the basis of the early position of L20 and L3 in the 50 S subunit assembly map.22 L36 had not been identified at the time those assembly studies were carried out, but the normal sedimentation and protein complement of DL36 50 S subunits suggest it is a late assembly protein. Thus, L36 is unusual in having an extensive influence on RNA folding without otherwise being required for ribosome assembly. Although L36 appears to play a significant role in stabilizing the ribosome in bacteria, it is missing from archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomes. In addition, comparing the archaeal H. marismortui and bacterial D. radiodurans structures, we see that no protein has filled the L36 niche (Figure 1). The coordinates of surrounding rRNA appear superimposable in these two species. Since we observe such significant perturbations in the ribosomal structure from the removal of L36, we speculate that Eucarya and Archaea have stabilized the correct rRNA fold in this region by other means. Given that the ribosome appears to be highly cooperative in this region, rRNA tertiary interactions and proteins located elsewhere in the structure may be able to confer the same stability

444 to this region of the ribosome as L36. Bacterial and archaeal 23 S rRNA tertiary contacts are not substantially different in the areas affected by L36, as the map of tertiary interactions produced for H. marismortui1 can be reproduced for the D. radiodurans structure.23 However, subtle differences in sequence may yield large changes in rRNA stability. For example, a substitution in a single unbonded base can result in significant stabilization of the RNA tertiary structure, as observed for U1061A in the L11 binding domain.24 U1061A is stabilizing because the mutation makes it more difficult for the RNA to adopt a misfolded structure. Similar base changes may have occurred in archaeal and eucaryotic rRNAs, which, in the absence of L36, would be under greater selective pressure to avoid misfolding. An alternative means by which Eucarya and Archaea could compensate for the lack of L36 is through the use of additional proteins. Some of the 8­12 additional eukaryotic or archaeal proteins associated with the large subunit may confer extra stability in the L36 binding region. Several of the bacterial ribosomal proteins associated with the RNA sequences examined in this work are replaced by different proteins in Archaea. For example, bacterial proteins L25 and L16 are replaced by L10e; the structures of these proteins are quite different, but are found in the same location in the ribosome.1,6 Since we have seen that the region of the ribosome organized by L36 folds in a highly cooperative way, detecting the specific RNA­RNA or RNA­protein interactions that perform the same role as L36 could be difficult. The ribosome may ° have an interaction over 60 A away that stabilizes the structure where L36 is missing.

chromosome, results in a precise deletion of the targeted rpmJ codons with no additional sequence change resulting from the gene replacement method. This method employs a temperature-sensitive origin of replication, pSC101, a chloramphenicol-resistance marker, and a counterselectable sacB marker. pCM_rpmJD6-35 was transformed into E. coli K12, and this transformation was grown with chloramphenicol selection at 42 8C to select for colonies that had integrated the plasmid into the chromosome. From this plate, several colonies were picked and serially diluted onto Luria Broth (LB) with 5% (w/v) sucrose plates at 30 8C. If the plasmid is still present in the cell, the colony will be unable to grow on sucrose plates. Colonies able to grow on 5% sucrose were screened on chloramphenicol for confirmation of the loss of pCM_rpmJD6-35. This resulting strain, called rpmJD6-35, was confirmed by PCR using primers specific to the rpmJ gene and primers specific to the surrounding chromosomal DNA, and by restriction digestion and sequencing of these PCR products. Two primers, 5 0 CCG GAA TTC CCG ATA ATT GGT CGC CCG AGA AGT TAC and 5 0 CGC GGA TCC TCA GCC TTG GCG CTG TTT ATG, were used to amplify rpmJ from E. coli chromosomal DNA and the gene was ligated into pKK223-3 restriction sites EcoRI and BamHI (restriction sites are underlined in the primer sequences).25 This expression vector with an inducible Ptac promoter was used to express L36 in trans. Measurement of growth rates Growth rates were measured in LB26 by diluting saturated overnight cultures into fresh medium. These cultures were monitored by absorbance at 550 nm at 20 min time-points. Growth rates were determined at 30 8C, 37 8C, and 42 8C. Growth rate data, absorbance at 550 nm (A550) versus time (t), were fit to the following equation: A550 Z m1 ½expðm2 tÞ=½1 C m3 m1 expðm2 tÞ where m2 is the growth rate, and m1 and m3 are factors that scale the curve to the absorbance values and take into account the slowing of growth as cells approach stationary phase, respectively. Absorbance values were weighted against themselves in a non-linear, leastsquares fitting protocol. Doubling times were determined from an average of three or four repetitions. Confirmation of the presence of remaining ribosomal proteins Ribosomes were extracted from wild-type and rpmJD635 cells in mid-log phase as described.27 Ribosomal proteins were extracted with acetic acid, precipitated in acetone, and then treated with iodoacetamide as described.28 Two-dimensional gel analysis was performed on the extracted ribosomal proteins.28 Additionally, Tris-tricine/urea 18% polyacrylamide gels of the extracted ribosomal proteins were run at 100 V for 8 h.13 The gel was stained with Sypro ruby (Molecular Probes). Analysis of subunits, tight couples, and polysomes Cell lysates for polysome profiles were prepared in a method similar to that described.29 Analysis of the fraction of subunits, tight couples, and polysomes was performed by centrifugation of the cell lysate through a 10%­40% sucrose gradient in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM

Materials and Methods
Construction of rpmJD6-35 In E. coli, the gene encoding L36, rpmJ, is located at the end of the spc operon and just upstream of the alpha operon. To avoid disrupting expression of other genes in the spc or alpha operons, an E. coli strain was constructed that replaces the coding region of rpmJ with a region that codes for the first five (MKVRA) and the last three (RQG) amino acid residues of L36. First, w2400 bases surrounding rpmJ were PCR amplified using the primers 5 0 CGA AGA AGA GCT CCG GCG TCG ATC ATT ATC CAG C and 5 0 GGA CTA GTG CTC CAG CAC ACC ATA GAT ACG GCG and ligated into pUC18 at restriction sites SacI and SpeI. Two steps of mutagenesis using the QuickChange Mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) were performed to delete a total of 90 bases. Mutagenesis primers used were 5 0 CTG CAA ATC ACA CGG GAC GGA AGC ACG AAC and 5 0 GCG AAA AAA TCA GCC TTG GCG AGC ACG AAC TTT CAT TTT TAC TC. The final construct was digested with BamHI and ligated into pKO3 to give pCM_rpmJD6-35.12 Using a gene replacement method as described12 but with some modifications, the chromosomal rpmJ gene was replaced with the cloned eight residue region. The method, which is based on homologous recombination of the plasmid into the

MgCl2, 100 mM NHCl4, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol in an SW-41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 2.5 h. After centrifugation, the tubes were punctured and the absorbance of the gradient was read using an Isco absorbance detector. Polysome profiles were performed in duplicate.

Structural probing of wild-type and DL36 ribosomes Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and hydroxyl radical probing were performed as described.30 In the DMS probing, 30 pmol of ribosomes was reacted with 1 ml of 880 mM DMS in a 25 ml total reaction for 10 min at 37 8C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 12.5 ml of stop buffer (1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 M EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 M b-mercaptoethanol) to the reaction. In the hydroxyl radical probing, hydroxyl radicals were generated by the Fenton reaction: 1 ml of each of 250 mM ascorbic acid, 2.5% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide, 100 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Fe(NH4)(SO4)$6H20 were added to 30 pmol of ribosomes in the order listed. The total reaction volume was 25 ml. Reactions were incubated at 37 8C for 10 min and terminated by addition of 10 ml of 0.1 M thiourea. For both DMS and hydroxyl radical reactions, total volumes were adjusted to 100 ml. rRNA was then extracted using three extractions with phenol, three extractions with chloroform, and then precipitation in ethanol. Primer extension was performed as described, using five primers.30 Primers are 17 bases in length, with the starting base at positions 1156, 2040, 2639, 2767, 2887 on the 23 S rRNA. The reactions were visualized on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Gel band intensities were quantified on a Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) and Excel. Because of the inherent noise associated with the footprinting technique, and the difficulty with determining protections by examining the gel image, an unbiased data analysis method was applied to all reactions. Using ImageQuant, peak profiles of counts versus distance can be determined along a line drawn down a gel lane. For these data, a line-width of 4­8 pixels was used. For all DMS or hydroxyl radical reactions, a peak profile for each primer was determined. These profiles were normalized to a single peak, either a pause or stop site. Each DL36 ribosome reaction peak height was compared to the peak height from the wild-type ribosome reaction performed at the same time. To determine whether correcting for differences between wild-type and DL36 control lanes would affect the data, the data with and without control lane subtractions were compared. Peak heights for wildtype and DL36 control lanes were normalized to the same peak as the reaction lanes. These values were subtracted from wild-type or DL36 peak heights that had been normalized. The ratio of corrected DL36 and wild-type peak heights were compared to the ratio determined for the uncorrected data. Overall, subtracting the control lanes had a small effect that was within the error of the measurement (see Results and the footnote to Table 2). The resulting data, reported in Table 2, are ratios of DL36 to wild-type rRNA reactivities. Values greater than 1.0 indicate that the nucleotide is more accessible to reagent when L36 is absent from the ribosome. The experiments were repeated four to seven times. Only values that differed from 1.0 by at least one standard deviation and showed more than 20% change (in the wild-type to DL36 ratio) are reported. Given the level of variation we see in the data, we considered less than a 20% effect too small to be significant.
