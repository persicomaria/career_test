An approach for designing bioreductive, hypoxia-activatable carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) inhibitors targeting the tumor-associated isoforms is reported. Sulfonamides incorporating 3,3-dithiodipropionamide/ 2,2-dithiodibenzamido moieties were prepared and reduced enzymatically/chemically in conditions present in hypoxic tumors, leading to thiols. The X-ray crystal structure of the most promising compound, 4-(2mercaptophenylcarboxamido)benzenesulfonamide, which as disulfide showed a KI against hCA IX of 653 nM (in reduced form of 9.1 nM), in adduct with hCA II showed the inhibitor making favorable interactions with Gln92, Val121, Phe131, Leu198, Thr199, Thr200, Pro201, and Pro202, whereas the sulfamoyl moiety was coordinated to the Zn2+ ion. The same interactions were preserved in the adduct with hCA IX, but in addition, a hydrogen bond between the SH moiety of the inhibitor and the amide nitrogen of Gln67 was evidenced, which may explain the almost 2 times more effective inhibition of the tumor-associated isozyme over the cytosolic isoform.
Introduction Hypoxia and acidic extracellular pHe constitute hallmarks of many solid tumors because of their improperly built and insufficiently functioning vasculature, lack of oxygen, and unregulated functioning of house-keeping enzymes, among which are the carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) involved in pH homeostasis, ion transport, and biosynthetic processes.1-3 Wykoff et al.3a investigated the expression of the CA9 gene,4 which encodes a tumor-associated CA isozyme, i.e., CA IX, in response to hypoxia. This research was based on observations showing that the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), which functions as a recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, negatively regulates the stability of the R subunit of the hypoxia inducible factor 1R (HIF-1R) in the presence of O2.5 Under normoxic conditions, oxygendependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) hydroxylate HIF-1R at specific proline residues in the central oxygen-dependent degradation domain.6 This hydroxylation mediates the interaction between HIF-1R and pVHL, leading to the degradation of HIF-1R.7,8 Under hypoxic conditions, which often develop in tumors,1 the lack of oxygen does not allow PHDs to hydroxylate HIF-1R and thus interferes with pVHL recognition pathways. In this way, HIF-1R accumulates in the cell and interacts with a constitutive HIF- subunit to form an active HIF-1 transcription factor that binds a hypoxia response elements (HRE) in the promoters of many hypoxia-regulated genes, activating their expression.6-8 By this mechanism, hypoxic tumor cells can

induce a number of genes involved in their adaptation to low oxygen concentrations, including those regulating cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism.9,10 Wykoff et al.3a showed that the CA9 promoter contains a functional HRE element localized on an antisense strand that is highly responsive to hypoxia, possibly because of its vicinity to a transcription start site, thus making CA9 one the most strongly hypoxia-induced genes.1,3,9,10 As a consequence, hypoxic tumors overexpress massive amounts of CA IX, an enzyme possessing high catalytic activity for the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and protons, which is also inhibited by the classical CA inhibitors belonging to the sulfonamide, sulfamate, and sulfamide classes of compounds.1,11-15 It has been proved by our groups that CA IX is a druggable target, being inhibited in the low nanomolar range by many different classes of sulfonamides, sulfamates, and sulfamides.11-15 In addition, Svastova et al.11 showed that in different tumor cell cultures in which CA IX is inhibited by potent and selective sulfonamide inhibitors, pHe returns to a more normal range (for example, from a pH value of 6.4 in the initial tumor cell culture to a pH of 7.2 after CA IX inhibition with sulfonamides)11 accompanied by an enhanced apoptosis of the tumor cells. Correlated with the fact that it has been shown earlier that some CA inhibitors do show anticancer activity in vivo,16-18 CA IX inhibition may constitute an attractive new approach for the management of hypoxic tumors, which are generally nonresponsive to the classical radio- and chemotherapy.1-3 One approach for improving the selectivity of tumor cell killing by anticancer drugs consists of the use of less toxic prodrugs that can be selectively activated in the tumor tissue, exploiting some unique aspects of tumor physiology such as selective enzyme expression or hypoxia.19 As mentioned above, since CA IX is overexpressed in hypoxic tumors, being present in very low amounts only in some parts of the normal gastrointestinal tract, this enzyme may constitute an attractive target for the design of hypoxia-activatable prodrugs. In fact,

there are many examples in the literature regarding bioreductive prodrugs, which use the reduction of quinones, N-oxides, and nitroaromatics by endogenous enzymes or radiation, the cleavage of amides by endogenous peptidases, and hydrolytic metabolism by a variety of exogenous enzymes, including phosphatases, kinases, amidases, and glycosidases,19-23 but no CA inhibitors were designed until now for this type of application. Here, we report the first hypoxia-activatable prodrugs targeting CA IX, an isozyme abundantly overexpressed in hypoxic tumors, an X-ray crystal structure of one of the most promising of such agents with the physiologically relevant isozyme CA II, as well as modeling binding studies of this compound with the target isoform, the transmembrane, and tumor-associated CA IX. Results and Discussion Chemistry. The rationale for the design of hypoxia-activatable prodrugs targeting the tumor-associated CA IX is based on exploiting the reducing conditions present in such tumors, in which pO2 is generally less than 1%.19d Thus, we considered the design of disulfide derivatives of the main class of CA inhibitors, the aromatic/heteroaromatic sulfonamides.24 In principle, such disulfide-containing sulfonamides should be bulky enough and thus unable to bind within the restricted space of the CA active site, which normally can accommodate only one benzenesulfonamide/heterocyclic sulfonamide moiety.15 However, bioreduction in hypoxic tumors of such dimeric sulfonamides, eventually mediated by the redox protein thioredoxin-1, which is found at high levels in many human cancers which is known to mediate this type of reduction,25 would generate thiols that are much less bulky and thus in principle should bind better to the active site of the CA isoforms present in tumor tissues. Since CA IX is mainly found only in hypoxic tumors, this type of hypoxia-activatable prodrug will be formed only in the cancer tissue, and as a consequence, no monomeric sulfonamide derivative should be present outside the tumor cell. This may lead to a tumor-specific drug with potentially fewer side effects due to inhibition of other CA isoforms highly abundant in noncancer tissues, such as CA I, II, IV, or VA.24 The chemistry employed for the design of the new compounds reported here is shown in Scheme 1. A series of 3,3dithiodipropionamide sulfonamides (2a-d, 3, and 4) were prepared starting from the commercially available dithiodipropionic acid, which was converted to 3,3-dithiodipropionyl dichloride (1) with neat thionyl chloride. The acyl chloride 1 was then reacted with the corresponding aminosulfonamide (i.e., sulfanilamide, 4-aminoethylbenzenesulfonamide, 3-halogenated sulfanilamides, 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, or 4-methyl-5-imino-2-1,3,4-thiadiazoline-2-sulfonamide)26 in pyridine/dioxane, leading to the compounds 2-4 in good yields, as reported earlier for structurally related carboxamidosulfonamides26 (Scheme 1). The disulfide benzamide compounds 5a and 5b were synthesized as previously described by Turpin et al.27 by reacting sulfanilamide or 4-aminoethylbenzenesulfonamide with 2,2dithiodibenzoyl chloride. These two derivatives have been reported earlier as possible anti-HIV agents that provoke metal extrusion from the zinc fingers of the viral nucleocapsid.27 The reduced derivatives of disulfides 2-5 (designated as H2H5; see discussion later in the text and Scheme 2) have been prepared by in situ reduction of the disulfides with a stoichiometric amount of aqueous sodium dithionite directly in the enzyme assay system (dithionite is not a CA I, II, or IX inhibitor)28 and were not isolated as pure compounds, since just the prodrugs 2-5 are of interest for possible new antitumor therapies.

isoforms hCA I and II (h means isozyme of human origin) and the transmembrane, tumor-associated isozyme hCA IX (Table 1). The following SAR was observed from data of Table 1. (i) Against the slow cytosolic isozyme hCA I, derivatives 2d, 5a, and 5b showed weak inhibitory activity, with inhibition constants (KI) in the range 4265-5115 nM. On the other hand, derivatives 2a, H2a, 2b, H2d, 3, 4, H5a, and H5b were much more potent hCA I inhibitors, with KI values in the range 41276 nM. The best hCA I inhibitors were H2b, H2c, H3, and H4, which showed KI values in the low nanomolar range of 9.5-18 nM, being much more effective in inhibiting this isozyme than ethoxzolamide (one of the best hCA I inhibitors reported)24 and the other clinically used derivatives. It is observed that all the reduced compounds are much more inhibitory compared to the corresponding dimeric disulfides. Another observation is that the derivatives incorporating the bulky 2,2-dithiodibenzamido moiety (5a, 5b) were generally less active as hCA I inhibitors compared to the compounds incorporating the less bulky, aliphatic disulfide moiety 3,3dithiodipropionamide. An exception is 2d/H2d, which showed a behavior similar to that of the aromatic disulfide containing sulfonamides 5a and 5b (and of their reduced counterparts, of course). For the 3,3-dithiodipropionamides 2-4, the presence of halogen atoms in the sulfanilamide scaffold or the heteroaromatic rings from 3 and 4 leads to enhanced hCA I inhibitory activity compared to that of the parent sulfanilamide 2a (this is also valid for the corresponding reduced derivatives of the disulfides discussed above). (ii) Against the rapid, pharmacologically highly relevant isoform hCA II, the compounds investigated here also showed very interesting inhibitory activity. Thus, as for the previously discussed isoform, the disulfide benzamide compounds 5a and 5b showed very weak inhibitory activity, with KI values in the range 4860-4975 nM. In contrast, the corresponding reduced derivatives H5a and H5b (as well as all the other reduced

compounds H2-H4 investigated here) showed effective hCA II inhibitory activity, with KI values in the range 8.9-29 nM. The other disulfides, incorporating aliphatic moieties, of types 2a-d, 3, and 4 showed an inhibitory activity between those discussed above. These compounds were less inhibitory compared to the corresponding thiols, with KI values in the range 42-94 nM, but much more effective inhibitors compared to 5a and 5b. Thus, our hypothesis that bulky disulfides such as compounds 2-5 reported here may show a hindered access to the CA active site due to steric impairment may be true. It is also noted that the clinically used compounds AAZ, MZA, EZA, DCP, ZNS, SLP, and IND are generally quite potent inhibitors of this isozyme, with KI values in the range 8-40 nM. (iii) Against the tumor-associated isoform hCA IX, the aromatic disulfides 5a and 5b again showed weak inhibitory activity (KI values in the range 653-724 nM), whereas derivatives 2a, H2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, and H2d were medium-potency inhibitors (KI values in the range 56-79 nM). On the other hand, the other reduced derivatives, i.e., H2b, H2c, H3 (and also the disulfide 3), H4 and its disulfide 4, H5a, and H5b, were very potent hCA IX inhibitors, with inhibition constants in the range 3.2-18 nM, in the same range as the clinically used compounds AAZ, MZA, EZA, DCP, ZNS, SLP, and IND (Table 1). It is observed that for the 3,3-dithiodipropionamide sulfonamides, the difference in hCA IX inhibitory activity between the reduced and the corresponding oxidized form is not very important. The monomeric, reduced (thiol) form is always more inhibitory compared with the disulfide (dimeric) syulfonamide. This difference is very high in the case of the disulfide benzamide compounds 5a and 5b (the case in which the reduced forms H5a and H5b are 72-80 times more inhibitory compared to the corresponding disulfide). Thus, considering the fact that for these two derivatives the difference between the hCA IX (but also hCA II and I) inhibitory activity of the reduced and oxidized forms is the highest one and also that the two compounds (in reduced form) are very potent hCA IX inhibitors, we consider them interesting candidates for in vivo evaluation as potential bioreductive drugs. As a consequence, we chose one of these derivatives (5a) for detailed X-ray crystallographic and modeling studies in order to better understand its interaction with various CA isozymes. (iv) Since hCA II is a ubiquitous house-keeping enzyme present in high amounts in many tissues/cells, it is important to discuss the selectivity ratios of the new compounds 2-5 for the inhibition of the target enzyme (hCA IX) over hCA II (Table 1). Indeed, many of the synthesized compounds are better hCA II inhibitors than hCA IX inhibitors, with a selectivity ratio of <1 (e.g., H2a, 2b, H2b, 2c, H2d, and all the clinically used sulfonamides except ZNS and SLP). However, some of the new derivatives reported here, such as 2a, H2c, 2d, and H5a, show selectivity ratios above unity, in the range 1.00-1.75. Several other new derivatives, such as 3, H3, 4, H4, 5a, 5b, and H5b show selectivity ratios in the range 2.52-7.61, thus showing a certain degree of selectivity for the inhibition of the tumorassociated over the cytosolic isozymes. Considering that the disulfide 5a is a very weak hCA I, II, and IX inhibitor, whereas the corresponding reduced form H5a is a potent and slightly isozyme-IX-selective inhibitor, we chose this compound for X-ray crystallographic and modeling studies.

crystallographic numbering of the atoms in this derivative and its disulfide prodrug), this compound has been cocrystallized with hCA II (trials to crystallize hCA IX in our and other laboratories were unsuccessful until now). Crystals of the adduct are isomorphous with those of the native protein,30 allowing for the determination of the crystallographic structure by difference Fourier techniques. The structure has been refined using the CNS program31 to a crystallographic R factor of 18.4% and an Rfree of 21.8% in the 20.00-1.80 Å resolution range. The refined structure represents a good geometry with rmsd values from ideal bond lengths and angles of 0.005 Å and 1.3°, respectively. The average temperature factor (B) for all atoms is 13.5 Å2. The overall quality of the model is excellent with all residues in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Inspection of the electron density maps at various stages of the refinement showed features compatible with the presence of only one H5a molecule bound to the active site (Figure 1). These maps are well defined for the 4-aminocarbonylbenzenesulfonamide moiety of the inhibitor. A poorer definition is observed for the 2-mercaptophenyl functionality, suggesting a greater flexibility of this group within the hCA II active site. The structure of hCA II in the enzyme-inhibitor complex exhibited only minor differences when compared to that of the native protein,30 as shown by the rmsd calculated over all the CR atoms between the hCA II-H5a complex and the unbound enzyme (rmsd ) 0.37 Å). Interactions between the protein and Zn2+ ion were entirely preserved in the adduct. A careful analysis of the threedimensional structure of the complex revealed a compact binding between the inhibitor and the enzyme active site, with the tetrahedral geometry of the Zn2+ binding site and the key hydrogen bonds between the sulfonamide moiety of the inhibitor and enzyme active site all retained with respect to other hCA II-sulfonamide complexes structurally characterized so far (Figure 1).15,24 In particular, the ionized nitrogen atom of the sulfonamide group is coordinated to the zinc ion at a distance of 1.97 Å. This nitrogen is also hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Thr199 (N,,,Thr199OG ) 2.74 Å), which in turn interacts with the Glu106OE1 atom (2.54 Å). The inhibitor O1 atom is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone amide of Thr199

(ThrN,,,O1 ) 2.85 Å), whereas the O2 atom is 2.93 Å from the catalytic Zn2+ ion. An extended network of hydrophobic interactions strongly stabilizes the organic scaffold of the inhibitor within the active site cavity. Thus, the aminocarbonylbenzenesulfonamide moiety of H5a fills the active site channel of the enzyme and establishes strong van der Waals interactions (distance of <4.5 Å) with the side chains of Gln92, Val121, Phe131, Leu198, Thr199, Thr200, Pro201, and Pro202 (Figure 1), whereas the H5a phenylthio moiety interacts poorly with the enzyme as confirmed by the rather disordered electron density. It is interesting to note that the carboxamido group of the inhibitor does not establish significant polar interactions with the amino acid residues of the active site but is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule (N2, ,,W501 ) 2.68 Å), which in turn interacts with Gln92NE2 atom (Gln92NE2,,,W501 ) 3.35 Å). This interaction has also been observed in the adduct of hCA II with a benzolamide derivative reported earlier by us, in which the secondary sulfonamide moiety (SO2NH) of the inhibitor was connected to Gln92NE2 by means of a water molecule.15c Modeling Studies. To assess the molecular basis of the small differences observed in the affinity of H5a toward hCA II and hCA IX (see Table 1), a model of the adduct of the inhibitor with the tumor-associated isoform hCA IX has been built up by homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations approaches as described in Experimental Protocols. The main protein-inhibitor interactions evidenced in this way are schematically depicted in Figure 2. According to this figure, H5a presents a spatial arrangement in the hCA IX active site similar to that observed in the complex with isoform II. In particular, the tetrahedral geometry of the Zn2+ binding site and the key hydrogen bonds between the sulfonamide moiety of the inhibitor and the enzyme active site were all retained. Even though hCA IX shares only 34% sequence identity with hCA II, residues of isoform II involved in the hydrophobic interactions with the organic scaffold of H5a are strictly conserved in the tumor-associated isoform IX except for the mutations Phe131/Val and Asn67/Gln. Thus, all the relevant hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the binding of H5a in the hCA II active site are retained in the hCA IX-H5a complex. In contrast, a

may explain the almost 2 times more effective inhibition of the tumor-associated isozyme over the cytosolic isoform. Work is in progress to test the effects of these compounds on their antitumor activity in vivo. Experimental Protocols
General. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX400 spectrometer using DMSO-d6 as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Chemical shifts are expressed in  (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane, and coupling constants (J) are expressed in hertz. Electron ionization mass spectra (30 eV) were recorded in positive or negative mode on a Water MicroMass ZQ. General Procedure for the Synthesis of N,N-(Dithiodipropionyl)bis(sulfonamide) Compounds (2-4). An amount of 3 g of dithiodipropionic acid was suspended in SOCl2 (15 mL), and the mixture was refluxed until complete dissolution of the acid. Thionyl chloride was then removed under reduced pressure to yield the dithiodipropionyl dichloride 1 as a pale-yellow oil. Compound 1 was used in the next step without further purification. Dithiodipropionyl dichloride 1 (1equiv, 1.2 mmol) dissolved in dioxane (5 mL) was added in a pyridine solution (10 mL) of aminosulfonamide (3equiv). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h and then poured into 200 mL of water and filtered. The residue was washed several times with water, dichloromethane, and ether. The corresponding N,N-(dithiodipropionyl)bis(sulfonamides) are obtained as a powder in 60-80% yields.

An Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument has been used for assaying the CA catalyzed CO2 hydration activity.29 Phenol red (at 0.2 mM) was used as indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) as buffer, 0.1 M Na2SO4 (for maintaining constant the ionic strength), following the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration reaction for 10-15 s. The CO2 concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 17 mM for the determination of the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. For each inhibitor at least six traces of the initial 5-10% of the reaction have been used for determining the initial velocity. The uncatalyzed rates were determined in the same manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. Stock solutions of inhibitor (1 mM) were prepared in distilled-deionized water with 10% (v/ v) DMSO (which is not inhibitory at these concentrations), and

unique polar interaction distinguishes the hCA IX-H5a adduct from its hCA II counterpart. In fact, the mutated Gln67 is involved in the formation of a stable hydrogen bond with the thiol group of H5a (Gln67NE2,,,S2 ) 3.2 Å). This weak polar interaction, which is absent in hCA II as a consequence of the shorter side chain of Asn67, can be considered as the unique structural feature accounting for the observed differences in binding affinity of H5a toward hCA II and hCA IX, but it is presumably quite important, since this inhibitor is roughly 2 times a more effective inhibitor of the tumor-associated isozyme (hCA IX) over the cytosolic one (hCA II). Conclusions We report here a novel approach for the design of bioreductive, hypoxia-activatable CA inhibitors targeting the tumorassociated isoform hCA IX. Sulfonamides incorporating 3,3dithiodipropionamide and 2,2-dithiodibenzamido moieties have been obtained from aminosulfonamides and dithiodi-aliphatic/ aromatic acyl halides. Such compounds may be reduced enzymatically (or chemically) under the reducing conditions present in hypoxic tumors, which are also rich in the redox protein thioredoxin-1, known to mediate this type of reduction with formation of thiol derivatives. Since the last compounds are much less bulky than the disulfides, they may show better CA inhibitory activity compared to the bulky, sterically hindered disulfides, which have difficulty entering the limited space of the enzyme active site. Indeed, most disulfides reported here showed this type of behavior, whereas the corresponding thiols acted as potent inhibitors of hCA I, II, and IX (with inhibition constants in the range 3.2-18 nM against the tumor-associated isoform). The X-ray crystal structure of the most promising compound in its reduced form, 4-(2-mercaptophenylcarboxamido)benzenesulfonamide, which as a disulfide showed a KI against hCA IX of 653 nM (in reduced form of 9.1 nM), in adduct with hCA II showed the inhibitor making a host of favorable interactions with the side chains of Gln92, Val121, Phe131, Leu198, Thr199, Thr200, Pro201, and Pro202, whereas the deprotonated sulfamoyl moiety was coordinated to the Zn2+ ion and made the classical hydrogen bonds with Thr199. The same interactions were preserved in the adduct of this compound with hCA IX, but in addition, a hydrogen bond between the SH moiety of the inhibitor and the amide nitrogen of Gln67 was evidenced (which is absent in the hCA II adduct), which

dilutions up to 0.01 nM were done thereafter with distilleddeionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at room temperature prior to assay, to allow for the formation of the E-I complex. The inhibition constants were obtained by nonlinear least-squares methods from Lineweaver-Burk plots, as reported earlier,12-15 and represent the mean of at least three different determinations. Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection, and Refinement. The hCA II-H5a complex was obtained by adding a 5 M excess of compound 5a to a 10 mg/mL protein solution in 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.5. Crystals of the complex were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. The drop consisted of 2 µL of the complex solution and 2 µL of the precipitant solution containing 2.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.3 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), and 5 mM 4-(hydroxymercurybenzoate) to improve the crystal quality. Crystals appeared after 1 week at 18 °C. X-ray diffraction data were collected at synchrotron source Elettra in Trieste, using a Mar CCD detector at 100 K. A cryoprotectant solution was made by inclusion of 15% (v/v) glycerol in the reservoir solution. Data were measured to 1.80 Å resolution and processed using Denzo.32 A total of 68 934 reflections were measured and reduced to 21 376 unique reflections (Table 2). The structure of the complex was analyzed by difference Fourier techniques, using the PDB file 1CA230 as a starting model for refinement. Water molecules were removed from the starting model prior to structure factor and phase calculations. The crystallographic R factor and Rfree, calculated in the 20.00-1.80 Å resolution range and based on the starting model coordinates, were 0.368 and 0.353, respectively. Clear electron density for only one monomeric unit (obtained by the reduction of the disulfide bond present in 5a, with formation of H5a; Scheme 2) of the inhibitor was observed in the difference map after a single round of refinement (R factor of 0.253 and Rfree of 0.288). A model for the inhibitor was then easily built and introduced into the atomic coordinates set for further refinement, which proceeded to convergence with alternating cycles of water addiction, manual rebuilding with the O program,33 and energy minimization and B-factor refinement with the CNS program.31 The final crystallographic R factor and Rfree values calculated for the 21 029 observed reflections (in the 20.00-1.80 Å resolution range) were 0.184 and 0.218, respectively. The statistics for refinement are summarized in Table 2. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession code 2HD6). Modeling Studies and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. A model of hCA IX catalytic domain was obtained using both hCA II and mCA XIV X-ray structures as templates as previously described by Alterio et al.34 The hCA IX-H5a starting adduct was then derived by superimposing the three histidine residues coordinating the Zn2+ active site ion of hCA II- H5a X-ray structure onto corresponding atoms of the hCA IX model. This preliminary adduct model was further completed by addition of all hydrogen atoms and underwent energy minimization with the SANDER module of AMBER8 package35 using the PARM99 force field.36 Atomic charges of the H5a molecule were obtained with RESP methodology.37 The H5a conformation derived from the hCA IIH5a crystal structure was fully optimized using the GAMESS program38 at the Hartree-Fock level with the STO-3G basis set. Single-point calculations on optimized molecule was performed at the RHF/6-31G* level. The resulting electrostatic potential was thus used for a one-stage single-conformation RESP charge fitting. Partial charges for the three catalytic histidines and Zn2+ were those published by Suarez and Merz.39 To preserve the integral charge of the whole system, partial charges of CR and HR atoms of the Zn2+-ligand residues and of N and H atoms of the inhibitor sulfonamide group were modified accordingly. A bonded approach between the Zn2+ ion and its ligands was adopted to preserve the experimentally observed tetrahedral Zn2+ coordination in all complexes during MD simulations. Equilibrium bond distances and bond angles involving the Zn2+ ion were derived from the hCA II-H5a crystal structure. Force constants of 120 kcal mol-1 Å-1 were used for N(His)-Zn2+ bond parameters, while force constants

of 20 and 30 kcal mol-1 Å-1 were adopted for N(His)- Zn2+N(His) and N(His)-Zn-N(sulfonamide) angle parameters, respectively. All the torsional parameters associated with interactions between Zn2+ and its ligands were set to zero as in Hoops et al.40 To perform MD simulations in solvent, minimized models were confined in truncated octahedral boxes filled with TIP3P water molecules and counterions (Na+) to ensure electrostatic neutrality. The solvated molecules were then energy-minimized through 1000 steps with solute atoms restrained to their starting positions, using a force constant of 10 kcal mol-1 Å-1 prior to MD simulations. The molecules were then submitted to 90 ps of restrained MD (5 kcal mol-1 Å-1) at constant volume, gradually being heated to 300 K, followed by 60 ps of restrained MD (5 kcal mol-1 Å-1) at constant pressure to adjust system density. MD production runs were carried out at 300 K for 1 ns with a time step of 1.5 fs. Bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.41 Snapshots from production runs were saved every 1000 steps and analyzed with MOLMOL program.42
