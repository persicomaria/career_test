ABSTRACT APETx1 is a 42-amino acid toxin purified from the venom of the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. This cysteine-rich peptide possesses three disulfide bridges (C4 ­C37, C6 ­C30, and C20 ­C38). Its pharmacological target is the Ether-agogo potassium channel. We herein determine the solution structure of APETx1 by use of conventional two-dimensional 1H-NMR techniques followed by torsion angle dynamics and refinement protocols. The calculated structure of APETx1 belongs to the disulfide-rich all-beta structural family, in which a threestranded anti-parallel -sheet is the only secondary structure. APETx1 is the first Ether-a-gogo effector discovered to fold in this way. We therefore compare the structure of APETx1 to those of the two other known effectors of the Ether-a-gogo potassium channel, CnErg1 and BeKm-1, and analyze the topological disposition of key functional residues proposed by analysis of the electrostatic anisotropy. The interacting surface is made of a patch of aromatic residues (Y5, Y32, and F33) together with two basic residues (K8 and K18) at the periphery of the surface. We pinpoint the absence of the central lysine present in the functional surface of the two other Ether-a-gogo effectors. Proteins 2005;59:380 ­386.

deeply associated with a double- or triple-stranded antiparallel -sheet, which is the only regular secondary structural element in these toxins. These toxins from spider, cone, and scorpion venoms act on potassium, sodium, and calcium channels.8,9 Recently, a new structural family was described, the all-alpha toxins, based on the unique structure of -hefutoxin1, a toxin from the scorpion Heterometrus fulvipes.10 An additional family consists of toxins from sea anemones (anthopleurin-A and -B, ShI, ATX-Ia, BDS-I), which are typically classified as disulfide-rich all-beta toxins.11 Recently, APETx1, a new peptidic blocker of human Ether-a-go-go potassium channels (HERG), purified from the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima, has been described. It membership in the disulfide-rich all-beta toxin family has been proposed.12 We herein report the determination of the solution structure of APETx1, found using 1H-NMR techniques, and discuss the pharmacological properties and selectivity of this peptide toward mammalian Ether-a-go-go potassium channels. MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of APETx1 The peptide APETx1 was purified from Anthopleura elegantissima crude extracts obtained from gel filtrations. Successive ion exchange and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) steps and conditions have been described previously.12 The molecular mass of the pure peptide was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization time-of-flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometry. Peptide samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-Pro system in reflector mode. Mass spectra (200 ­300 scans) were calibrated with internal standards and analyzed using Data Explorer software. Sample Preparation for NMR A quantity of 4 mg of APETx1 was dissolved in 500 L of a H2O/D2O mixture (9:1 v/v) to give a concentration of 1.76 mM at pH 3.0. The amide proton exchange rates were obtained on a sample dissolved in 500 L of 100% D2O.

Key words: Anthopleura elegantissima; APETx1; sea anemone toxin; structure determination; potassium channel inhibitor; HERG; NMR INTRODUCTION Numerous small proteins that are natural ligands for ion channels have been described in the literature. These toxins were first classified into two main families according to their structural motifs. The cystine-stabilized / (Cs ) motif was first described for scorpion toxins that act on potassium and sodium channels.1 The structure of these toxins consists of a small double- or triple-stranded anti-parallel -sheet linked to a short -helix by two disulfide bridges. One additional (more rarely two) disulfide bond further stabilizes the motif.2­ 4 A second structural family, the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif, can be described as a knot of disulfides (two disulfides and part of the backbone of the protein form a ring and a third disulfide threads through this ring, leading to the definition of the knot) in the core of the protein.5­7 This knot is

NMR Experiments The H-NMR spectra were all recorded on a BRUKER DRX500 spectrometer equipped with a HCN probe, and self-shielded triple axis gradients were used. The experiments were performed at two different temperatures, 280 and 290K, in order to solve assignment ambiguities. Two-dimensional spectra were acquired using the StatesTPPI method to achieve F1 quadrature detection.13,14 Water suppression was obtained either using presaturation during the 1.3 s relaxation delay and during the mixing time for NOESY spectra, or with a watergate 3-9-19 pulse train15 using a gradient at the magic angle obtained by applying simultaneous x-, y-, and z-gradients prior to detection. TOCSY was performed with a spin-lock time of 80 ms and a spin locking field strength of 8 kHz. The mixing time of the NOESY experiments was set to 80 ms. The individual amide proton exchange rates were determined by recording one series of four NOESY spectra (each experiment was 10 h long) at 280K on the D2O sample. Amide protons still giving rise to nuclear Overhauser effect (nOe) correlations after 40 h of exchange were considered to be slowly exchanging and therefore engaged in an hydrogen bond. Analysis of Spectra The identification of amino-acid spin systems and the sequential assignment were completed using the standard strategy described by Wuthrich16 and regularly used by ¨ our group,17­19 applied with the XEASY graphical software.20 The comparative analysis of COSY and TOCSY spectra recorded in water gave the spin-system signatures of the protein. The spin systems were then sequentially connected using the NOESY spectra. Experimental Restraints The nOe were integrated by measuring the peak volumes using a routine of XEASY. These volumes were then automatically translated into upper-limit distances by the calibration routine of the ARIA software.21 The torsion angle constraints resulted from the 3JHN-H coupling constant measurements that were measured on a DQF-COSY spectrum with 8192 data points in the acquisition dimension. These angles were restrained to 120 40° for 3JHN-H 8Hz and to 65 25° for 3JHN-H 6 Hz. No angle constraint was assigned to a 3JHN-H 7 Hz, a value considered to be ambiguous. Determination of the amide proton exchange rates led us to identify protons involved in hydrogen bonding. The oxygen partners were then identified by visual inspection of the preliminary calculated structures. Structure Calculation The distance restraints and dihedral angles obtained from measured nOe volumes and 3JHN-H coupling constants respectively were used in structural calculations to determine the conformation of the toxin. These restraints were introduced as input for ARIA21 implemented in CNS 1.1.22 In the first run, the calculations were initiated using default parameters and using only nOe peak list and
1

dihedral angle restraints. The disulfide bridges were not used at that stage. This first run allowed us to correct the attribution of the nOe correlations and ended with a preliminary fold of the APETx1 protein without using disulfide bridge restraints. We were then able to univocally define the disulfide bridge partners as well as hydrogen bond partners. In the second run, the distance restraints, dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges were used. Respectively, 8000, 10000, and 8000 steps were used for molecular dynamics refinement, first-stage cooling, and second-stage cooling. We calculated 100 structures in the final iteration, and 50 were kept for water minimization. The 25 best solutions were kept to define the threedimensional structure of APETx1 toxin. Visual analysis of the final selection of solutions was carried out with the TURBO and Pymol graphic softwares,23,24 and the geometric quality of the resulting structures was assessed with PROCHECK 3.4 and PROCHECK-NMR software.25 Electrostatic Calculation The electrostatic potential and dipole moment of the toxin were calculated using the GRASP software26 running on a Silicon Graphics Workstation. This calculation includes all ionizable groups in the peptide, based on the Amber force field of the residues. The potential maps were calculated with a simplified Poisson­Boltzmann solver.26,27 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION NMR Resonance Assignment and Secondary Structure The spin systems were identified on the basis of both COSY and TOCSY spectra. Once the sequential assignment procedure was achieved, almost all protons were identified and their resonance frequency determined (BMRB code 6370). The distribution of the H i/HNi 1, H i/HNi 1 and HNi/HNi 1 nOe correlations indicates that the toxin is mainly organized in extended regions, characterized by strong H i/HNi 1 correlations together with large 3JHN-H coupling constants [Fig. 1(a)]. Structure Calculation A preliminary calculation using only nOe restraints allowed us to univocally define the disulfide bridge partners. This pattern consists of C4 ­C37, C6 ­C30, and C20 ­C38 and is consistent with other all-beta sea anemone toxins. The structure of APETx1 was determined by using 751 nOe, including 366 intra-residue restraints, 140 sequential restraints, 61 medium-range restraints, and 184 longrange restraints. The repartition of these nOe along the sequence is shown in Figure 1(b) (top). In addition, 36 hydrogen-bond restraints derived from proton-exchange data and 20 dihedral angle restraints derived from the measurement of coupling constants were included, as well as nine distance restraints derived from the three disulfide bridges that were deduced from the observation of the structures after the first run of calculation. Altogether, the final experimental set corresponded to 19.4 constraints per residue on average.

Filled circles represent 3JHN-H coupling constants 8 Hz and open circles those 6 Hz.. Collected sequential nOe are classified into strong, medium and weak nOe, and are indicated by thick, medium, and thin lines respectively. The horizontal arrows indicate the secondary elements (extended regions). (B) nOe (top) and RMSD (bottom) distribution vs. sequence of APETx1. Intraresidue nOe are in black, sequential nOe in dark gray, medium nOe in light gray, and long-range nOe in white. RMSD values for backbone and all heavy atoms are in black and gray, respectively.

The calculation using the whole set of restraints and water-solvent minimization led to a single family of 25 solutions [Fig. 2(a)], the structural statistics of which are given in Table I. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculated on the whole structure was 0.82 0.17 Å for the backbone and 1.28 0.17 Å for all heavy atoms. If N- and C-terminal residues are omitted, these values drop to 0.63 0.12 Å and 1.13 0.15 Å respectively, which indicates a poor resolution of N- and C-terminal residues. This is confirmed by the individual RMSD values [Fig. 1(b)]. All of the solutions have good non-bonded contacts and good covalent geometry, as shown by the low values of CNS energy terms and low RMSD values for bond lengths,

valence angles, and improper dihedral angles. Correlation with the experimental data shows no nOe-derived distance violation greater than 0.2 Å. Analysis of the Ramachandran plot for the ensemble of the 25 calculated models (in PROCHECK software nomenclature) reveals that 73.3% of the residues are in the most favored regions, 26.7% in the allowed regions and none in the generously allowed and disallowed regions (data not shown). Structure Description Convergence of the 25 final solutions [Fig. 2(a)] allowed us to describe the structure of APETx1 [Fig. 2(b)] [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1WQK], which consists of a com-

ence of a cis-proline was also found in BDS1 toxin, which is another sea anemone toxin.28 Comparison With Related Toxins The activity of APETx1 was determined by its inhibition on HERG currents recorded from COS transfected cells using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. APETx1 (300 nM) inhibited 75% of the HERG tail current evoked at 40 mV after a depolarizing step to 0 mV from a holding potential of 80 mV.12 The fold of APETx1 places it in the Defensin family, according to the SCOP database.29 This family includes numerous toxins from sea anemone venoms [Fig. 3(a)]: Anthopleurin-A and -B (PDB codes 1AHL and 1APF respectively) from the giant green sea anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammica, which acts on voltage-gated sodium channels, toxin ATX IA from Anemonia sulcata, which inhibits sodium channels (PDB code 1ATX), ShI from Stichodactyla helianthus (PDB code 1SH1), and BDS1 from Anemonia sulcata (PDB code 1BDS), first described as an anti-hypertensive and anti-viral protein, then as an inhibitor of the potassium channel Kv3.4.30 APETx1 does not possess any sequence similarity with any of these toxins except BDS1 toxin, which possesses 37% sequence similarity with APETx1, excluding cystine residues [Fig. 3(b)]. Nonetheless, both toxins are organized around the same overall fold while bearing different specificities. Various Folds Can Accommodate HERG Recognition HERG channel is a six-transmembrane segment voltagedependant potassium channel generating outward currents with inward rectification properties. It is essential in cardiac cells for the control of the plateau phase of the action potential. Besides non-peptidic blockers of HERG channel (methanesulfonanilide, dofetiline, and ibutilide), which act as open channel blockers, three peptidic blockers of known three-dimensional structure have been described. Two of them belong to the Cs fold family, scorpion toxins BeKm-1 from the venom of Buthus eupeus (PDB code 1J5J)31 and CnErg1 (also named ErgTx1) from the venom of Centruroides noxius (PDB codes 1NE532 and 1PX933). These proteins contain an -helix linked by disulfide bridges to a triple-stranded -sheet. Both BeKm-

pact disulfide-bonded core composed of a four-stranded -sheet from which emerge a loop (16 ­27) and the N- and C-termini. APETx1 can therefore be classified as a disulfide-rich all-beta toxin.

It includes residues 3­ 6 (strand I), 9 ­15 (strand II), 28 ­32 (strand III), and 35­39 (strand IV), which are well detected by the PROCHECK-NMR software. According to the dihedral angle values, strands I and II are connected by a type II -turn (residues 6 ­9), strands III and IV are connected by a type II -turn (residues 32­35), and stands II and III are connected by the 16 ­27 loop. The existence of strong nOe between H 39 and H 40 indicates that the P40 is in cis-conformation.16 The pres-

131 and CnErg134 are supposed to bind in the S5PS6 motif of the channel and act as gating modifiers. Interestingly, the two toxins BeKm-1 and CnErg1 interact with the receptor site through two different regions. A mutagenesis study performed on BeKm-131 showed that the critical residues for binding are Y11 on the N-terminal part of the helix, K18, K20, and F21 located at the end of the -helix, and K23 located after the helix [Fig. 4(a), left]. As far as CnERg1 is concerned, no experimental data are available, but two different hypotheses have been proposed. Torres et al.32 have proposed that the critical residues constitute a hydrophobic patch (Y14, F36, and F37) with a central basic residue K13 [Fig. 4(a), middle], while by computational evolutionary trace analysis, Frenal et al.33 have predicted two important amino acid clusters, one hydrophobic cluster made of Y14, Y16, Y17, F36 as well as K13 and K38 acting as cation- interacting residues, and one hydrophilic cluster made of D3, S4, and K25 [Fig. 4(a), right]. As the Cs scaffold can bear a variety of pharmacological functions,35 careful analysis of the molecular surface of the toxin, and delineation of a putative functional surface,

is of utmost importance to understand how subtle variations of the amino-acid sequence influence the spatial structure of the toxin and hence define a specific pharmacology. Towards that aim, our group has developed a prediction method of the interacting surface based on the existence of a molecular dipole moment that reveals the electrostatic anisotropy of peptides. Although in our earlier articles we hypothesized that the dipole would act as a driving force, this assumption has been corrected in the sense that the electrostatic anisotropy is now proposed to act as an orientating force of the ligand within the electrostatic field of the membrane receptor, rather than as a driving force. As a consequence, the intensity of the dipole moment is much less important than its orientation. The recent work of Jouirou et al.36 has confirmed that the intensity of the dipole is unrelated to the affinity of the ligand. This anisotropy must therefore be understood as a guide in the specificity for a given channel and not in its affinity. Therefore the molecular surface through which the dipole emerges is hypothesized to be involved in the interaction with the receptor site of the toxin.17,37 This prediction method has been extensively validated for

toxins acting by pore occlusion, for which structure­activity data based on site-directed mutagenesis are available.38 ­ 40 Applied to BeKm1 and CnErg1 toxins, the calculation shows that the dipole emerges next to or nearby the residues proposed by Korolkova et al.31 and Torres et al.32 respectively, i.e. between residue K18 and K23 at the end of the helix in the BeKm1 toxin and between Y14 and F36 near the first strand of the CnErg1 toxin; however, this disagrees with the proposal of Frenal et al.,33 who described a disrupted interaction surface made, on the one hand of the same residues proposed by Torres et al., and on the other hand of D3, S4 and K25. When applying our prediction method to APETx1, the overall charge distribution reveals a marked electrostatic anisotropy that is represented by the dipole moment shown in Figure 4(b). The electrostatic calculation shows that this dipole emerges through the third strand of the -sheet (near the G31), defining a potential interaction surface composed of three aromatic residues (Y5, Y32, and F33 in the -sheet and the turn), two basic residues (K8 and K18) and three aliphatic amino acids (G7, G31, and L34). The dipole of APETx1

defines a putative plane surface [Fig. 4(b)]. We therefore propose that the conserved orientation of the dipole moment, which emerges through a hydrophobic patch combined with the immediate vicinity of basic residues, could delineate the interaction surface of the toxin with its receptor. Due to their different overall folds, the putative surface of APETx1 is different from the surface of BeKm1 and CnErg1 but presents some similarities: the surface is made of a patch of aromatic residues together with two basic residues at the periphery of the surface. The main difference is the absence of central lysine. As the toxins possess the same mechanism of action (i.e., they act not by occluding the channel but by modifying its gating) in the same range of affinity, we can propose that APETx1 also inhibits the HERG channel by binding to the outer vestibule of the channel. The difference in the interacting surfaces may reveal slight differences in the target region located in the S5P loop region.
