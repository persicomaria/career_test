Abstract--Based on a lead compound identified from the patent literature, we developed patentably novel BACE-1 inhibitors by introducing a cyclic amine scaffold as embodied by 1a and 1b. Extensive SAR studies assessed a variety of isophthalamide replacements including substituted pyrrolidinones and ultimately led to the identification of 11. Due to its favorable overall profile, 11 has been extensively profiled in various in vivo settings. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder, for which no effective treatment is currently available. One of the major pathological hallmarks of AD is the abnormal deposition of amyloid plaques comprised of Ab40,42 peptides in the brain of AD patients. These peptides arise from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by b-amyloid cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1)2 and c-secretase.3 As BACE-1 catalyzes the first committed step in the synthesis of b-amyloid, inhibitors of BACE-1 are expected to be useful treatments for AD. In the preceding paper in this issue,4 we described the discovery of conformationally constrained versions of the hydroxyethylamine (HEA) motif found in many peptidomimetic inhibitors.5 Based on a lead structure identified from the patent literature,6 we developed 4-benzyloxypyrrolidine and 4-phenoxypyrrolidine containing inhibitors 1a and 1b with good in vitro potency (5 nM and 3 nM, respectively) although with low cellular activity and modest selectivity against other human aspartyl proteases (Fig. 1). In addition, both inhibitors

exhibited insufficient pharmacokinetic properties in rats as evidenced by low plasma levels following oral dosing. We now report on studies of various isophthalamide replacements to improve the bioactivity, pharmacokinetic parameters as well as ancillary profile of our cyclic amine BACE-1 inhibitors, ultimately resulting in the discovery of 11.

Inspection of the X-ray structure for 4-benzyloxypyrrolidine-based inhibitor 1a bound to BACE-1 revealed two hydrogen-bonds from the isophthalamide carbonyl-groups to the peptide backbone NH-groups of Thr232 (S3 subsite) and Thr72 (flap), along with hydrophobic contacts within the S3 and S2 enzyme subsites (Fig. 2).8 As part of our plan to identify isophthalamide replacements, we decided to retain the internal amide with its key interaction to the flap Thr72 while broadly screening for more appropriate S2­S3 moieties. Synthetically, this would entail amide formation from our key intermediate, aminoalcohol 2,4 followed by Boc-deprotection (Scheme 1). Several dozen inhibitors including aliphatic amides (3), benzamides (4), arylacetamides (5), and cinnamides (6) were synthesized yet elicited uniformly poor bioactivity (BACE-1 IC50: 10­100 lM) and were not further profiled (Scheme 1). Amides (7) and sulfonamides (8) incorporating azetidine-3-carboxylic acid exhibited reasonable potency (BACE-1 IC50 = 1­10 lM) yet demonstrated a fairly flat SAR most likely due to reduced hydrophobic contacts in the S2 subsite and suboptimal interactions with Thr232.

Considering that pyrrolidinones have a larger molecular volume than azetidinones and display the pyrrolidine N-substituent differently with respect to Thr232 and the S3-enzyme subsite, we decided to investigate BACE-1 inhibitors containing N-substituted pyrrolidinones 99 (Tables 1 and 2). The modest potency of the prototypical inhibitor 9a with its small N-ethyl group (BACE-1 IC50 = 7 lM) underlines the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the S3 enzyme subsite (Table 1). With increasing chain length (9b, 9d­9f), in vitro potencies greatly improved reaching a maximum of 45 nM for 9e. While further branching was tolerated (9c, 9g, and 9h), incorporation of a less hydrophobic oxygen atom resulted in diminished activity (9i­9l). A screen of benzyl groups (9m­9s) revealed the incompatibility of para-substitution--even a small fluoro-substituent (9n) led to a 10-fold loss of activity (vs. N-benzyl 9m). Meta- and ortho-substitution was tolerated with BACE-1 IC50s similar to the parent compound, though cellular activity was diminished. To moderate the cellular potency, we also screened a variety of heteroaryl groups (9t­9y). Despite maintaining in vitro potency for all but 9y (BACE-1 IC50: 219­312 nM), cellular activities were largely unimproved. Since X-ray crystallography of 9d and 9e suggested that stereodefined 2-substituted pyrrolidinones may yield additional binding affinity, we evaluated inhibitors 10a­10h (Table 2). Although substituting the C2-position of 9d with alkyl or benzyl groups (10a­10d) moderately improved the in vitro and cellular activity, we did not observe a similar improvement for the N-pentyl series (10e­10h). Taken together, these studies revealed that the pyrrolidinone scaffold appeared inferior to the isophthalamide moiety, prompting us to revisit further modifications of 1a and 1b.

Another isophthalamide moiety widely adopted throughout the patent literature10 forms the basis for BACE-1 inhibitor 11 and its benzyloxypyrrolidine congener (Fig. 3).8 Replacement of the N,N-dipropylamide present in 1b with a 2-(R)-methoxymethylpyrrolidine amide resulted in a marked increase in cellular potency (BACE-1 Ki = 0.7 nM, cell IC50 = 21 nM), while maintaining good selectivity over related human aspartyl proteases such as cathepsin D, cathepsin E, and renin. When tested in rats (10 mpk po dose), 11 exhibited improved pharmacokinetic properties with reasonable AUC (841 nMÆh) though a low brain/plasma ratio of less then 0.1. In a study with a 5 mpk iv dose, a rat plasma half-life of 3.2 h was determined, with a high volume of distribution (Vd = 15 L/kg) and clearance (Fig. 3). BACE-1 inhibitor 11 has a good ancillary profile and did not inhibit the tested CYP enzymes (>30 lM). The compound has high human and mouse plasma protein binding, reasonable kinetic solubility and no significant inhibition in a rubidium-efflux hERG assay. Although

moderate permeability was observed in the Caco-2 P-gp assay, the efflux ratio was high (B­A/A­P = 174) indicating that 11 is most likely a substrate for the P-gp transporter. This may account for the low brain/plasma ratio observed in the rat PK studies. Due to its favorable overall profile, inhibitor 11 was extensively profiled in the transgenic CRND8 mouse model (Fig. 4).11 Upon oral dosing to 6-week old preplaque CRND8 mice at 10, 30, and 100 mpk, plasma Ab40 was reduced by 4%, 25%, and 70% relative to the vehicle group. Subcutaneous dosing further improved exposure levels resulting in even greater reduction of plasma Ab40 (10 mpk: À58%; 30 mpk: À77%; 100 mpk: À88%). Despite whole brain concentrations in excess of 50-fold its cellular IC50, 11 had no effect on cortical Ab40 levels. In conclusion, replacement of the isophthalamide portion of BACE-1 inhibitor 1a with various truncated amides and N-substituted pyrrolidinones did not improve in vitro or cellular potency.
