Abstract--Recent efforts to identify treatments for chronic diabetic complications have resulted in the discovery of a novel series of highly potent and selective (2-arylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acid aldose reductase inhibitors. The compound class features a core template that utilizes an intramolecular hydrogen bond to position the key structural elements of the pharmacophore in a conformation, which promotes a high binding affinity. The lead candidate, example 40, 5-fluoro-2-(4-bromo-2-fluoro-benzylthiocarbamoyl)-phenoxyacetic acid, inhibits aldose reductase with an IC50 of 30 nM, while being 1100 times less active against aldehyde reductase, a related enzyme involved in the detoxification of reactive aldehydes. In addition, example 40 lowers nerve sorbitol levels with an ED50 of 31 mg/kg/d po in the 4-day STZ-induced diabetic rat model. Ó 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Diabetes mellitus and its disabling complications, which include blindness, renal failure, neuropathy, limb amputation, myocardial infarction, and stroke affect some 17 million people in the United States with an estimated cost of over 100 billion dollars annually.1 Through various clinical studies, including the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), the development and progression of these complications in type I and type II patients has been clearly linked to elevated blood glucose levels.2,3 During euglycemic conditions glucose is preferentially metabolized through the glycolytic pathway where it is phosphorylated with ATP by hexokinase to form glucose-6-phosphate. However, during conditions of hyperglycemia, as observed in diabetes mellitus, elevated blood glucose levels saturate the norKeywords: Aldose reductase; Aldehyde reductase; Diabetes; Complications. * Corresponding author.

mal pathways of glucose metabolism and a dramatic increase in flux through the polyol pathway results (Scheme 1). Glucose entering the polyol pathway is reduced to sorbitol by aldose reductase (ALR2) and NADPH. Sorbitol is subsequently oxidized to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase and NAD+. This increased flux through the polyol pathway results in a change in redox potential for these cofactors. The increased ratio of cytosolic NADH to NAD+ is called reductive stress, which has been linked to depleted intracellular levels of glutathione, increased nonenzymatic glycation, and activation of protein kinase C.4,5 In addition to reductive stress, accumulation of sorbitol in certain cells results in osmotic stress, which can lead to cell swelling and eventually cell death.6 Inhibitors of aldose reductase can prevent these metabolic and biochemical changes, which have been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetic complications.7 In addition to these biochemical endpoints, recent reports provide a strong genetic correlation between over expression of aldose reductase and the development of diabetic complications.8­10 As a result, a high ALR2

level is now considered to be an important risk factor for chronic diabetic complications including neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. Although many potent aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) have been identified and developed, none are currently marketed for worldwide use.4,7 Many of these candidates failed to gain acceptance due to an inadequate therapeutic index. In some cases this toxicity may have resulted from a lack of selectivity relative to aldehyde reductase (ALR1). The physiological importance of ALR1 has been clearly demonstrated.11,12 It converts highly reactive 2-oxoaldehydes like 3-deoxyglucosone and methyl glyoxal to their corresponding nonreactive alcohols.13,14 These aldehydes, which are involved in the formation of various protein cross-links and other advanced glycation end products (AGEs), are formed as degradation products from glucose and fructose.15 During conditions of prolonged hyperglycemia, high concentrations of these aldehydes are formed resulting in the development of chronic diabetic complications and accelerated aging.16­18 As a member of the aldo-ketoreductase super family, ALR1 shares greater than 85% homology with ALR2 (rat and man).19 Specific amino acid changes in the C-

terminal loop, a section of the protein lining the active site cleft, are responsible for various substrate and inhibitor specificities.20 Efforts to design novel, potent, and selective ARIs have resulted in the discovery of a compound class that features a 2-arylcarbamoyl-phenoxyacetic acid as a core template. Within this template, an intramolecular hydrogen bond is used to position the acetic acid moiety and aromatic side chain, the key structural elements of the pharmacophore, in the necessary orientation for high binding affinity. 2. Inhibitor design and synthesis The target compounds were synthesized using methods illustrated in Schemes 2­4. (2-Arylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acids 6, 8, and 13 in Scheme 2 illustrate methods used to prepare most examples. Treatment of commercially available 2,4-difluorobenzoic acid (1) with sodium hydroxide at 135 °C affords 4-fluorosalicyclic acid.21 Activation of the carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride provides the corresponding acid chloride, which is coupled with 3-nitrobenzylamine to give amide 4.

Diazotization of commercially available 5-methoxy-2methyl-4-nitroaniline (14) with sodium nitrite in the presence of HF-pyridine provided the corresponding fluoride22 (15) in 76% yield. Subsequent hydrogenation followed by diazotization and treatment with a CuBr provided bromide 17.23 Treatment with CuCN in DMF at 160 °C gave nitrile 18 (86%), which was hydrolyzed with aq NaOH to give carboxylic acid 19. Formation of the acid chloride with oxalyl chloride and catalytic DMF followed by coupling with 4-bromo-2-nitrobenzylamine provided amide 20 in nearly quantitative yield. Deprotection of the methyl ether with 25% HBr in acetic acid at 120 °C followed by alkylation with ethyl bromoacetate and hydrolysis provides target amide 25. Alternatively, treatment of ester 22 with phosphorous pentasulfide and subsequent hydrolysis provides the corresponding thioamide target (24). The syntheses of additional 4-fluoro analogs with other substituents in the 5-position were conveniently prepared via bromide 26 as illustrated in Scheme 4. Bromination of 4-fluorosalicyclic acid with Br2 in a solution of acetic acid and sulfuric acid followed by alkylation with iodomethane and aq K2CO3 provided the bis-alkylated intermediate 27 in 76% yield (two steps). This highly functionalized salicylic acid intermediate was used to prepare examples with a variety of substituents in the 4-position. For example, the morpholine intermediate 28 was prepared from bromide 27 using standard Bu ¨ckwald conditions.24 The nitrile intermediate 30 was prepared by treating bromide 27 with CuCN in DMF at 150 °C (75%). Additionally, a Suzuki coupling of phenylboronic acid with bromide 27 provided phenyl derivative 32. These intermediates were used to prepare the corresponding target compounds using methods already described in Schemes 2 and 3.

lysis of the ethyl ester gives phenoxyacetic acid 6. Alternatively, treatment of amide 5 with phosphorous pentasulfide followed by hydrolysis provides thioamide derivative 8. If the benzothiazole derivatives are desired, aminoacetonitrile can be used in place of the substituted benzylamine to provide nitrile 9, which can subsequently be condensed with the desired 2-aminothiophenol (10) to provide amide 11. Alkylation of the phenol with ethyl bromoacetate followed by hydrolysis of the ethyl ester provides the target benzothiazole derivative 13 in high yield. Additional examples, where the desired substituted salicylic acid or corresponding 2-fluorobenzoic acid starting materials were not commercially available, were prepared separately and are described in Schemes 3 and 4. The 2-fluoro-3-methyl examples were prepared using chemistry outlined in Scheme 3.

3. Results and discussion The major objective of this program has been to identify highly potent, selective and efficacious aldose reductase inhibitors for treatment of chronic diabetic complications. All compounds in the program were initially tested for potency against human aldose reductase (hALR2) and selectivity relative to human aldehyde reductase (hALR1). Selected compounds with significant in vitro activity against hALR2 were also tested in the 4-day streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rat model. The results from these experiments are listed in Tables 1­3. The program benefited significantly from the early use of X-ray crystallography. The structures provided a clear understanding of the important interactions that make up the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. This information was used to identify the specific fragments of the inhibitor template that provided the greatest opportunities for optimization of potency and selectivity relative to aldehyde reductase. The complexes were obtained using hALR2 expressed in E. coli and crystallized with the oxidized form of the coenzyme b-NADP+ at pH 5 and 277 K. Initial results with example 40 provided a clear picture of the inhibi° tor-enzyme complex (1.8 A). As illustrated in Figure 1, the inhibitor is oriented in the active site of hALR2 in a manner such that the hydrophilic carboxylate head forms tight hydrogen bonds with the OH of Tyr 48 ° ° (2.74 A), the NE2 of His 110 (2.67 A), and the NE1 of ° ). The carboxylate also forms an optimal Trp 111 (3.07 A ° intramolecular hydrogen bond (3.01 A) with the amide N­H forming a unique nine-membered ring. In addition to the hydrogen bonding interactions, the benzyl side chain forms a nearly perfect p-stacking interaction with the indole moiety of Trp 111. These interactions anchor the inhibitor deep within the enzyme active site. As this class of inhibitors bind to the hALR2 active site, a conformational change occurs opening a pocket localized between Phe 122, Trp 111, Leu 300, and Ala 299.25 The specific opening of the pocket varies to accommodate each inhibitor, producing an Ôinduced fitÕ. Since the residues lining this pocket are not conserved in aldehyde reductase, the interactions are specific for ALR2.26­28 As a result, inhibitors with binding interactions in this Ôspecificity pocketÕ are generally highly selective for aldose reductase. The specific interactions within the specificity pocket, for example, 40 include a significant p-stacking interaction of the benzyl side chain with the indole moiety of Trp 111, H-bonding interactions between the side chain fluorine and amide N-HÕs of ° ° Leu 300 (3.30 A) and Ala 299 (3.27 A), and an unusually short contact between the benzyl Br and Thr 113-OG ° (2.98 A). This Br-Thr-OG interaction is likely important for selectivity since in aldehyde reductase Thr 113 is replaced by a much bulkier tyrosine, which would cause steric hindrance. After significant optimization, subsequent co-crystallization experiments with example 40 have resulted in a

new, more refined, structure with exceptional resolution ° (0.66 A). These results will undoubtedly advance our understanding of the catalytic mechanism. The details of this work has been published separately.29 With a clear picture of the inhibitor-enzyme complex early in the lead optimization program, little was done with the (2-arylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acid core structure. New analog synthesis was primarily directed to those areas perceived to have the greatest potential for significant improvement. In keeping with our belief that selectivity relative to aldehyde reductase would play an important role in the success of any clinically useful ARI, a significant portion of the optimization effort was directed toward the aromatic side chain. The side chain is the portion of the inhibitor that interacts with the C-terminal loop, the region of the enzyme most differentiated between hALR2 and hALR1. In general, the structure­activity relationships associated with the structural class are consistent with binding information derived from the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Large variations in hALR2 activity are observed with different substitution patterns on the aromatic side chain. In general, the compounds with the strongest binding affinities contained electron deficient aromatic side chains. All examples with strong electron donating substituents had poor binding affinities with IC50Õs > 2 lM (35, 7methoxy; 43, 6,7-methylenedioxo; 50, 6,8-dimethoxy). Examples with substituents only in the para-position (R7) were, at best, only weakly active with Br being preferred with an IC50 of 550 nM (37, Br > 41, Cl > 34, H > 35, OCH3 > 36, CF3). Addition of an ortho- or meta-substituent often provides a dramatic increase in potency. This is illustrated in example 42 where introduction of a second chlorine (6,7-dichloro), results in an IC50 of 34 nM. This is nearly a 40-fold increase in potency relative to example 41 (7-choro), which has an IC50 of 1300 nM. A similar effect is observed when comparing example 37 (7-bromo) with example 38 (5fluoro-7-bromo). Introduction of the 5-fluoro group brings the IC50 from 550 to 30 nM, nearly a 20-fold increase in potency. In general, electron withdrawing groups capable of being hydrogen bond acceptors in the ortho or meta-positions appear to be critical for high in vitro potency. Preferred substituents include fluorine, trifluoromethyl, and nitro. The IC50Õs for examples with a 6-fluoro (46), 6-trifluoromethyl (47), and 6-nitro (44) are 820, 39, and 6 nM, respectively. Introduction of second meta-substituted group can provide some improvement as seen in example 48, with a 6-triflouromethy and 8-fluoro-substituent, which has an IC50 of 29 nM. All activity is lost however when two large trifluormethyl substituents are present in the meta-positions as seen in example 49 with an IC50 of only 22 lM. In this example, the side chain is simply too large for the specificity pocket. As consistent with previously identified ARIs, the preferred substitution patterns appear to be the 3-nitro benzyl (8) and the 2-fluoro-4-bromo benzyl (40).30,31 These examples are highly potent and selective with IC50Õs of 6 and 30 nM for hALR2 and 35,000 and 33,000 nM for hALR1, respectively.

Substitution on the core salicylic acid structure is generally well tolerated and can significantly improve in vitro and in vivo activity. Exceptions include those examples with large groups in the 1 and 2-positions where unfavorable steric interactions occur with VAL 47 (examples 54, 57, and 72). When comparing examples 39 and 52, introduction of fluorine in the 2-position provides about a threefold increase in potency and selectivity. In vivo efficacy is also significantly increased with the 2-fluoro substituent. The 3-methyl derivative (64) also provided a significant improvement in potency, selectivity, and in vivo efficacy relative to the unsubstituted example (52). When combined together, the 2-fluoro-3-methyl derivative (25) provided an additive improvement relative to the monosubstituted examples in the primary in vitro assay. Unfortunately, the same effect was not observed in the in vivo model. Examples with a nitro substituent in the meta-position on the benzyl ring (R6) are consistently most potent in the primary in vitro assay. Some of the most interesting examples combine the 6-nitro substituent on the aromatic side chain with the 2-fluoro substituent on the salicylic amide moiety (examples 6, 8, 44, 75­81). Within this series a variety of substituents have been introduced in the 3-position. Examples 75 (R3 = bromo) and 76

Note the short contacts of the inhibitor carboxylic acid head with residues Tyr 48, His 110, and Trp 111 and the perfect pstacking of the benzyl side chain with the indole moiety of Trp 111.

(R3 = morpholino) are also two of the most selective with IC50Õs for hALR1 of 44,000 and 54,000 nM, respectively. With selectivity ratios (hALR1/hALR2) > 7000, these are among the most selective inhibitors identified to date. Other examples in this series including 77 (R3 = cyano), 78 (R3 = phenyl), 80 (R3 = methyl), and the corresponding thioamide derivatives (79 and 81) are also very potent, but somewhat less selective. In addition to the (2-benzylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acids a few {2-[(benzothiazol-2-ylmethyl)-carbamoyl]phenoxy}-acetic acids were also prepared (Table 2). In general the in vitro and in vivo activities were comparable to the benzyl series. Example 87 with a 2-fluoro substituent has similar potency for hALR2 as the corresponding example with the 2-chloro substituent (86), but is approximately fourfold more selective. When

comparing substituents on the benzthiazole, the 5,6,8trifluoro example (13) is about twofold more potent and selective relative to the 6-trifluoromethyl example (87). The thioamide analog of example 13, (88) is somewhat less potent and selective, but both have good activity in the STZ-diabetic rat model. Because of the obvious importance in positioning the key elements of the pharmacophore, few modifications of the amide linker were explored. The N-methyl derivative, example 85, is approximately 700-fold less active than the corresponding N­H derivative, example 6. As expected, this indicates the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the phenolic ether and carboxylate is critical for activity. In contrast to the N-methyl derivative, a significant improvement in oral efficacy was also obtained when the amide was converted to the thioamide. As evident from examples 6 and 8, oral efficacy improved from 41% for the amide to 89% for the thio amide at 50 mg/kg/d. A similar but less dramatic effect was also observed with the 2-fluoro-4-bromo derivatives (examples 39 and 40). In conclusion, a novel series of (2-arylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acid derivatives have been identified and optimized as highly potent and selective inhibitors of aldose reductase. In vivo evaluation of example 40, 5-fluoro-2-(4-bromo-2-fluoro-benzylthiocarbamoyl)-phenoxyacetic acid, in the 4-day STZ-induced diabetic rat model resulted in lowered nerve sorbitol levels with an ED50 of 31 mg/kg/d (po). This compares favorably with tolrestat, an important aldose reductase inhibitor already developed for treatment of chronic diabetic complications. Continued development of these compounds may result in an important new treatment for chronic diabetic complications. 4. Experimental section 4.1. Chemistry 4.1.1. General methods. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes on a Thomas­Hoover apparatus and are uncorrected. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were determined on a Varian Gemini 2000 (300 MHz) instrument. Chemical shifts are provided in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane (internal standard) with coupling constants in hertz (Hz). Multiplicity is indicated by the following abbreviations: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), broad (br). Mass spectra were recorded on a Perkin­Elmer API 100. Elemental analyses (C, H, N, S, Cl, Br) were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. (Norcross, Georgia) and are within ±4% of theory unless otherwise noted. Products from all reactions were purified by either flash column chromatography or medium pressure liquid chromatography using silica gel 60 (230­400 mesh Kieselgel 60, EM Reagents) unless otherwise indicated. Thin-layer chromatography using glass-backed silica plates containing a fluorescent indicator (0.25 mm, Whatman, Merck) was used to monitor reactions. The chromatograms were visualized

using ultraviolet illumination, exposure to iodine vapors, or dipped in an aqueous potassium permanganate solution. All starting materials were used without further purification. All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of dried nitrogen. 4.1.2. General procedures for the synthesis of (2-arylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acid derived ARIs. (2-Arylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acids 6, 8, 13, 34­56, 61­4, 66, 69, 72­74, and 82­88 (Tables 1 and 2) were prepared from 2,4-difluorobenzoic acid 1 or the corresponding commercially available salicylic acids as outlined in Scheme 2 via the general experimental methods described, for examples, 6, 8, and 13 below. The substituted 2-aminothiophenol hydrochloride salts used to prepare examples 13 and 86­88 as illustrated were prepared by literature methods32 or purchased commercially. 4.1.3. [5-Fluoro-2-(3-nitro-benzylcarbamoyl)-phenoxy]acetic acid (6). 4.1.3.1. Step 1: synthesis of 4-fluoro-2-hydroxy-benzoic acid (2). A solution of 2,4-difluoro-benzoic acid (100 g, 0.63 mol) in 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (1400 mL, 0.45 M) was treated with sodium hydroxide (88 g, 2.2 mol) and heated to 135 °C. After stirring for 4 h, the solution was cooled to 0 °C and dissolved in water (100 mL). After transferring the solution to a 5 L Erlenmeyer flask, aq HCl (2800 mL, 2 N) was carefully added. After filtering off the crude product, the precipitate was dissolved in ethyl acetate, dried over sodium sulfate and decolorizing charcoal, and filtered. The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and recrystallized from ethyl acetate and heptane to give 4-fluorosalicylic acid (two crops, 67 g, 68%) as off-white needles. Mp: 188­189 °C; Rf 0.26 (20% methanol in dichloromethane). 4.1.3.2. Step 2: synthesis of 4-fluoro-2-hydroxy-benzoyl chloride (3). A suspension of 4-fluoro-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (15 g, 96.1 mmol) in heptane (190 mL) was treated with thionyl chloride (21 mL, 288 mmol) in a dropwise manner over 30 min. A drop of N,N-dimethylformamide was added and the solution was heated for 4 h at 60 °C. The excess thionyl chloride was distilled off under reduced pressure. The remaining solution was cooled to room temperature, filtered, and concentrated to give 4-fluoro-2-hydroxy-benzoyl chloride as a pale yellow crystalline solid (14.2 g, 85%). 4.1.3.3. Step 3: synthesis of 4-fluoro-2-hydroxy-N-(3nitro-benzyl)-benzamide (4). A solution of 4-fluoro-2-hydroxy-benzoyl chloride (12.3 g, 70.3 mmol) in dichloromethane (140 mL) was cooled to 0 °C, and treated with N,N-diisopropylethylamine (31.0 mL, 175 mmol) and 3nitrobenzylamine hydrochloride (16 g, 84.6 mmol). After stirring at room temperature for 24 h, the solution was concentrated in vacuo and diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed successively with aq 2 N HCl and saturated aq NaCl, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated.

Aq NaOH (35 mL, 5.8 M, 204 mmol) was combined with an aq silver nitrate solution (35 mL water, 2.9 M, 102 mmol) and stirred. The resulting suspension was cooled to 0 °C and treated with 2-hydroxy-5-trifluoromethoxy-benzaldehyde (10.0 g, 48.5 mmol) in several portions. After the addition was complete, the reaction was stirred an additional 10 min and filtered. The precipitate was washed with hot water and the combined washings were acidified to pH 1 with concd HCl. The resulting precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, dissolved in ethyl acetate, and washed with saturated aq

NaCl. The solution was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to give 2-hydroxy-5-trifluoromethoxy-benzoic acid (9.8 g, 91%) as a white solid: Rf 0.38 (20% methanol in dichloromethane); 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) d 10.30 (br s, 1H), 7.79 (d, J = 3.0 Hz, 1H), 7.41 (dd, J1 = 9.3 Hz, J2 = 3.0 Hz, 1H), 7.05 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H). 4.2. Pharmacology 4.2.1. Enzyme preparation. Recombinant human aldose reductase (hALR2) was overexpressed in E. coli using a T7 based expression system and purified using a metal affinity column.35 The enzyme was precipitated in 3.5 M ammonium sulfate, 10 mM Tris­HCl buffer and 1 mM DTT. The enzyme was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellet was resuspended to an approximate concentration of 10­15 mg protein/mL in (NH4)2SO4 in NaH2PO4, pH 6.6. Protein content was determined using Coomassie Protein Assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Aliquots were made and the enzyme was stored at À40 °C. Recombinant human aldehyde reductase (hALR1) supplied by Dr. K. Gabbay (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) was prepared as previously described.36 The enzyme was stored in 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mM EDTA at 4 °C. Protein content was determined using Coomassie Protein Assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 4.2.2. Enzymatic assays. The method to examine the inhibition of aldose reductase (ALR2) was similar to those methods used by numerous other laboratories.37­39 Enzymatic activity was measured by monitoring the disappearance rate of NADPH. Briefly, compound or solvent is placed in the microplate well to which buffer is added and mixed for 1 min. Enzyme is added to the well and incubated at 37 °C and shaken for 10 min. DL -Glyceraldehyde and NADPH are added to initiate the reaction. The microplate is placed in the platereader for 30 min at 340 nm and read at 2 min intervals. The reaction contents in a final volume of 300 lL are 6.6% (NH4)2SO4, 33 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.6), 0.11 mM NADPH, 4.7 mM DL -glyceraldehyde, 0.59 lg enzyme, 1% DMSO, and compound. Percent inhibition is calculated based on the enzyme activity in the presence or absence of compound. The IC50 is calculated using SAS release 6.10 and a four-parameter logistic regression of data. The inhibition of aldehyde reductase (ALR1) was assessed using a standard spectrophotometric assay.36 The procedure is similar to the method described above for determining ALR2 inhibition. The reaction contents in a final volume of 300 lL are 33 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 6.6), 0.11 mM NADPH, 4.7 mM DL -glyceraldehyde, 0.28 lg enzyme, 1% DMSO, and compound. 4.2.3. STZ-induced diabetic rat model. Male Sprague­ Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), weighing 150 g, are allowed to acclimate for one week and placed on a standard diet (7012, Harlan Teklad certified

LM-485 mouse/rat, Madison, WI). Water is supplied ad libitum. After a 24 h fast, 40 mg/kg STZ (S01230 Sigma, St. Louis, MO) prepared in 0.03 M citrate buffer, pH 4.5 is administered ip. Control animals receive citrate buffer. Four days after receiving STZ, tail blood glucose is measured using a One Touch II blood glucose meter (Lifescan, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Milpitas, CA). Diabetic rats whose blood glucose levels are P 300 mg/ dl are randomized according to blood glucose levels into diabetic control and diabetic-treatment groups. Each study includes 5 nondiabetic controls, 10 diabetic controls, and 7 diabetic rats for each drug-treated group. Beginning on day 4 after induction of diabetes with STZ, the compound is administered for five consecutive days po suspended in a vehicle of 2% Tween 80 in saline. Nondiabetic and diabetic controls receive vehicle during this period. After the initial dose of compound, animals continue to receive the standard diet for the remainder of the study. After receiving the final dose of compound, the food is removed. Four hours after the final dose is administered, the rats are euthanized by asphyxiation with CO2 and sciatic nerves are removed, weighed, frozen on porcelain plates on dry ice, and stored at À80 °C for sorbitol analysis. 4.2.4. Tissue sorbitol analysis. Sciatic nerve sorbitol levels are measured by a standard enzymatic method that uses sorbitol dehydrogenase.40,41 A D -sorbitol kit purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (670 057 Indianapolis, IN) was adapted to a microplate format. Tissues are homogenized in ice cold 0.2% perchloric acid in methanol using a DUALL tissue grinder and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. A sampling of the supernatant is transferred to a microplate. A reaction mixture combining buffer, diaphorase, NAD+, and iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT) is added to each sample followed by an initial absorbance reading at 490 nm. Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) is added to initiate the reaction and the plate is mixed for 90 s on an orbital shaker. Plates are incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min and the final absorbance reading at 490 nm is made. The reaction contents in a final volume of 255 lL at pH 8.7 are 14.1 mM potassium phosphate, 94 mM triethanolamine, 0.94% Triton X-100, 0.16 U diaphorase, 1.66 mM NAD, 0.034 mM INT and 0.82 U SDH. Sciatic nerve sorbitol content is calculated as nmol sorbitol/mg wet tissue weight by taking the difference in the final and initial absorbance readings and comparing to a sorbitol standard curve. % Inhibition is calculated by comparing treatment groups to both the nondiabetic and diabetic control groups within the study as described by the equation: (t À n)/(d À n) where n = nondiabetic control, d = diabetic control, and t = drug-treated diabetic control. The ED50 was calculated using Sigma plot, version 4.0, using a Hill slope four-parameter logistic equation.

4.3. X-ray crystallography 4.3.1. Overproduction and purification of recombinant human ALR2. The ORF of the human ALR2 gene (Accession GenBankTM/embl Data Bank Number J05017) was amplified by PCR from its cDNA and cloned into the T7 RNA polymerase-based vector pET15b (Novagen). Expression of the (HIS)6-human ALR2 in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) is induced by IPTG (Euromedex) during a 3 h culture at 37 °C. The pellet from a 4 L culture was disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied on a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech). After thrombin cleavage of the hexahistidine extension, the detagged protein was then loaded on a DEAE Sephadex A-50 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a NaCl gradient. 4.3.2. Crystallization trials and preliminary crystallographic analysis. All trials were carried out in Linbro 24well tissue culture plates (Flow Laboratories) using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mM ammonium citrate pH 5.0. The drops of a final volume of 12 mL contained 15 mg/mL of human ALR2 with 2 equiv of NADP+ (Sigma) and 5% of PEG 6000; they were equilibrated against a well containing 120 mM ammonium citrate, pH 5.0, 20% PEG 6000 and the same concentration of NADP+ as above. Crystals were grown at 4 °C and reached the size of 0.5 · 0.4 · 0.4 mm. 4.3.3. Soaking with the inhibitor. Crystals of the ALR2inhibitor complex were obtained by soaking of the native crystals with a solution containing 2 mg/mL of inhibitor dissolved in the mother liquor containing 120 mM ammonium citrate, pH 5.0, and 25% of PEG 6000. The soaking time was three weeks. 4.3.4. Data collection and refinement. The diffraction analysis was performed using a rotating anode laboratory source and an image plate, and the data treated with the HKL package.42 The inhibitor-soaked crystals ° diffracted to 1.8 A and were isomorphous to the native crystals. The native structure was used as a model for the molecular replacement; after a rigid-body minimization, the inhibitor was placed in the electron density shown by a Fourier difference map. The model of the complex was used as starting point of the refinement, which included a rigid-body refinement step, a slowcooling step, a Powell minimization, and a temperature-factor refinement. Water molecules were then placed in a difference map and minimization was performed as above without putting restraints on the water molecules; bulk solvent correction was also applied. The programs O 43 and X-PLOR 44 were used for model building and refinement. Diffraction experiments were conducted on two crystals at the X-ray beam of the undulator line 19ID of SBCCAT at the APS. All conditions were optimized for the high resolution experiments.29
