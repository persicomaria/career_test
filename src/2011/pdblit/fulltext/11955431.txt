Abstract Human erythrocytes (E) react by exocytosis of membrane vesicles to various stresses including the fixation of the membrane attack complex of Complement. E from normal individuals loose a notable proportion of their initial number of surface CR1 molecules during the ageing process. An acquired decrease of CR1 on E also occurs in pathological conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or AIDS. The present study investigated whether calcium ionophore A23187 (Ca-ion) induced vesicle formation of human E in vitro is responsible for a preferential loss of CR1 as well as whether CR1 molecules at the surface of Ca-ion treated E or vesicles are: (i) functional, (ii) native or protease degraded, or (iii) more clustered than CR1 on native E. A study of E from 137 normal individuals showed that a one-hour Ca-ion induced vesicle formation preferentially removed one third of E surface CR1. Kinetic experiments suggested that all surface CR1 could be removed from E upon longer incubation times. CR1 molecules on vesicles were still able to inhibit Complement activation, and were found in larger clusters than on native E. These data suggest that a significant part of surface CR1 molecules may be removed from E by vesicle formation during the life of E in normal individuals. This phenomenon could be exacerbated in pathological conditions. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

X. Dervillez et al./ lmmunopharmacology 38 (1997) 129-140

The human C3b/C4b C receptor type 1 (CR1, CD35) (Fearon, 1980, 1984) is expressed on the surface of various blood cells, on neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, B lymphocytes, a subset of T lymphocytes, but also on glomerular podocytes, follicular dendritic cells and E (Fearon and Wong, 1983; Ross and Medof, 1985). The approximate mean number of CR 1/cell is 20,000 for neutrophils, 21,000 for B lymphocytes, 30,000 for monocytes (Fearon and Wong, 1983) and 500 for E (Cohen et al., 1987). Despite the relatively low density of CR1 on E when compared to leukocytes, it has been estimated that over 85 percent of CR1 molecules in the circulation are expressed on E (Hebert, 1991; Hebert et al., 1991). CR1 is also found in soluble form in plasma (Fearon and Wong, 1983; Yoon and Fearon, 1985). A trans-membrane form of soluble CR1 has been found in synovial fluids from rheumatoid arthritis patients in addition to the canonical extra-cellular form of soluble CR1 (Sadallah et al., 1997a,b). E-CR1 binds C3b and C4b that are covalently attached to IC, a reaction that is particularly efficient due to the cluster distribution of CR1 on E (Paccaud et al., 1988). E appear to act as passive shuttles for the transport of C-coated IC from the circulation to the liver or the spleen (Cornacoff et al., 1983; Davies et al., 1990). E bound IC are then removed from E and captured by reticuloendothelial mononuclear phagocytic cells of the liver or spleen (Davies et al., 1989; Schifferli and Taylor, 1989). CR1 has also a potent inhibitory function in the C cascade both on the cell surface and to a lesser extent in the fluid phase, as a cofactor for the cleavage by factor I of C3b to C3bi and then to C3dg (Fearon, 1979; Iida and Nussenzweig, 1981; Medof et al., 1982). CR1 is a polymorphic glycoprotein composed of a single polypeptide chain that exists in four allotypic forms of M r ranging from 160,000 to 250,000 (Dykman et al., 1985; Wong, 1990; Wong et al., 1989). The two most common forms, the A and B allotypes, have M r of 190,000 and 220,000 (Dykman et al., 1983; Wong et al., 1983) and two rarer forms have M r of 160,000 and 250,000 (Dykman et al., 1985). All four CR1 allotypes have C3b/C4b binding activity (Dykman et al., 1983; Wong et al., 1983; Dyk-

man et al., 1985). The average number of CR1 on E varies very widely among normal individuals (Miyakawa et al., 1981; Iida et al., 1982; Wilson et al., 1982). A bimodal distribution of E-CR1 levels has been established in normal individuals, that is genetically determined (Fearon, 1979, 1980; Wilson et al., 1986). The density of CR1 on E from normal individuals is controlled by a codominant bi-allelic system, at a single locus (Wilson et al., 1982, 1986), associated with a single base mutation within an intron of the structural gene, as demonstrated by a polymorphism in the restriction-fragment length of the CR1 gene (Wilson et al., 1986) that can also be assessed by polymerase chain reaction - - restriction fragment length polymorphism (Cornillet et al., 1991). A decreased amount of E-CR1 has been reported in several diseases (Miyakawa et al., 1981; Iida et al., 1982), including SLE (Wilson et al., 1982; Walport et al., 1985; Cohen et al., 1992), auto-immune hemolytic anemia (Ross et al., 1985), paroxysmal noctumal hemoglobinuria and AIDS (Tausk et al., 1986; Cohen et al., 1988). This was initially considered likely to be a genetically determined primary effect in SLE (Miyakawa et al., 1981; Wilson et al., 1982). Further studies established that the low number of CR1 on E in SLE patients appeared to be predominantly an acquired phenomenon (Walport et al., 1985; Cohen et al., 1989a). Furthermore, the loss of E-CR1 correlated with disease activity in SLE (Walport et al., 1985; Cohen et al., 1989a, 1992) as well as with disease severity in AIDS (Tausk et al., 1986; Cohen et al., 1989b). However, the situation has been made more complex by the discovery that the number of CR1 molecules on E decreases physiologically with the age of E in vivo (Ripoche and Sim, 1986; Moldenhauer et al., 1988; Cohen et al., 1992). The mechanism responsible of the loss of CR1 on ageing is poorly understood, but might be similar to that of the acquired loss of CR1 in diseases. CR1 molecules could be lost from ageing E by a wearing-out process involving proteolysis, because it is sensitive to proteolysis in vitro (Ripoche and Sim, 1986). Alternatively, native CR1 molecules could be lost in the form of membrane vesicles. E are indeed able to react by exocytosis and membrane vesicle formation in response to various stresses such as heating

(Coakley et al., 1978), calcium loading, ATP depletion (Allan et al., 1976; Allan and Thomas, 1981) or the fixation of the MAC of the C (Sims and Wiedmer, 1986; Iida et al., 1991). E can preferentially loose GPI-anchored proteins such as ACHE, DAF or CD55 and MIRL or CD59, in the form of cytoskeleton-free vesicles, during Ca-ion induced vesiculation (Dumaswala and Greenwalt, 1984; Biitikofer et al., 1989). This vesiculation renders E more sensitive to C mediated hemolysis because CD55 and CD59 were lost (Test et al., 1991). Thus, vesiculation might represent a cellular way to escape C lysis. The mechanism by which GPI-anchored proteins are enriched on vesicles is unclear. A local alteration in membrane structure during formation of vesicles and an increase of the lateral movement of the GPIanchored proteins could be a prerequisite for the enrichment of GPI-anchored proteins in vesicles (Biitikofer et al., 1989). A recent study has suggested that vesicles released from human E also contained CR1 molecules (Pascual et al., 1993). Mechanisms of both a physiological and pathological decrease of CR1 density on E, if distinct, remain poorly deciphered. Several explanations have been proposed to explain an acquired reduction of CR1 on E in several IC-mediated diseases. The most commonly cited candidate mechanisms are surface proteolytic cleavage of CR1 (Ross et al., 1985; Walport et al., 1987; Davies et al., 1989) or vesicle formation (Pascual et al., 1993). Alternatively, the hypothesis of a decreased CR1 synthesis could be also advocated. A blockage of CR1 antigenic sites by autoantibodies or IC can be ruled out as a very rare phenomenon (Wilson et al., 1985; Cook et al., 1986). In the present study, both kinetics and quantitative aspects of CR1 shedding from E upon Ca-ion induced vesicle formation were investigated in order to check (i) whether the mechanism of exocytosis of membrane vesicles preferentially eliminates CR1 molecules from E, like other molecules (CD55, CD59), (ii) whether this phenomenon is of the same magnitude that physiological decrease of E-CR1 with age or the acquired decrease of E-CR1 in pathological conditions, or (iii) whether CR1 molecules are lost from E surface in their native clustered form, or (iiii) whether the vesiculation of E is accompanied by proteolysis of CR1 molecules.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Anti-CR1 monoclonal antibodies and CR1 length polymorphism
J3D3, J 3 B l l and 3D9 anti-CRl MoAbs were kindly provided by E. Fisher (Inserm U430, Paris). E9 anti-CR1 MoAb was kindly provided by D.J. Birmingham (Department of internal medicine, nephrology, Columbus, OH). TO5 anti-CR1 MoAb was purchased from Dako (Dako, Copenhagen), and E11 from Valbiotech (Paris). Experiments were performed on E of the homozygous AA and heterozygous AB genotypes corresponding to the A or B alleles of CR1 (Klickstein et al., 1987; Wong, 1990).

2.2. Papain treatment of E membrane proteins
E membrane proteins were digested by using papain as previously described (Quadri and Schifferli, 1992). 109 E were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a 150 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.0 containing 140 mM NaCI, 0.2% glucose, 1% of 0.5 M EDTA and 200 /xg/ml papain (Merck, Darmstadt). Digestion was stopped by adding a mixture of 100 /xl of 100 mM PMSC (Merck) and 400 /xl of a ten-fold concentrated protease inhibitor cocktail kit (ICN Biomedicals, Orsay) including AEBSF, EDTA-Na 2, leupeptin and pepstatin. Supernatants of papain treated E were concentrated about 10 fold by a 5,000 × g centrifugation during 5 min in concentration devices of a molecular weight cut-off 30 kDa (Amicon, Epernon) at 4°C. E were washed three times in ice-cold PBS then membrane proteins were extracted and analyzed under SDS-PAGE.

2.3. Western-blot analysis of CR1 alleles and fragments using different anti-CR1 MoAbs
CR1 alleles and fragments on E were defined after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as previously described. The studies were performed with E from individuals homozygous AA, or heterozygous AB for the A or the B alleles of CR1 (data not shown). Western-blot analysis of CR1 was performed using different MoAbs (J3D3, J3B11, TO5, 3D9, E9 and E11).

2.4. Vesiculation of E using calcium ionophore A23187
Ten ml of fresh human blood were washed twice in ice-cold PBS without calcium and magnesium (Biomerieux, Marcy L'etoile) at 640 X g for l0 rain, and washed once in ice-cold l0 mM Tris pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.2% glucose, 144 mM NaC1. Sixteen percent hematocrite E were incubated for 3 rain at 37°C with shaking in 8 ml of 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.2% glucose, 144 mM NaCI and 1 mM CaC12. Subsequently, calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma, Saint-Quentin Fallavier) was added to E suspensions at a final concentration of 4 /~M and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with shaking. Controls E (untreated E) were incubated in the same conditions but in a CaC12 and Ca-ion-free 10 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.2% glucose, 144 mM NaCl. Vesicle formation was finally stopped by adding 100 /zl of 0.5 M EDTA. The kinetics of the loss of CR1 from E upon calcium induced vesiculation were studied by stopping the Ca-ion induced vesiculation after different times of incubation.

diluted in PBS and centrifuged 5 min at 640 X g or at 12,000 X g for E and for vesicles respectively.

2.6. Analysis of CRI antigenic sites at the surface of E, calcium ionophore treated E and uesicles by western blotting
E and Ca-ion treated E were washed twice in PBS, then pelleted by centrifugation at 640 x g for 10 min. Ghost membranes were prepared from 25/zl of E pellet, 25 /zl of Ca-ion treated E pellet and whole vesicles respectively by hypotonic lysis in 10 ml of ice-cold distilled water containing 100 /zl of 100 mM PMSC and 500/zl of ten fold concentrated protease inhibitor cocktail kit (ICN), then centrifuged at 12,000 X g at 4°C for 15 rain. Controls were performed in the same conditions by omitting protease inhibitors during hypotonic lysis. After complete removal of supernatants, pellets were resuspended in 40 /xl of 10 mM Tris/HC1 pH 7.4 buffer containing 150 mM NaC1, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA and 1% NP40, then centrifuged at 10,000 x g at 4°C for 15 rain. Supernatants containing E membrane proteins were collected, then subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions on 6% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (1970). Proteins were blotted onto PVDF western blotting membranes (Boeringer Mannheim, Meylan) at 100 V during 3 h in an ice-cold 25 mM Tris blotting buffer containing 192 mM glycine and 15% methanol (v/v). Blots were incubated overnight at 4°C in PBS blotting buffer containing 5% non fat milk powder (Lovelait ®, Saint-Martin-Belle-Roche) and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were then successively incubated in 1% non fat milk powder/0.05% Tween 20 PBS containing monoclonal anti-CR1 (J3B11:30 /xg; E 1 1 : 1 0 /zg), in a 400 fold diluted sheep biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Life Science, Les Ulis) and in a 1.500 fold diluted streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase solution (Amersham). Blots were washed three times in 1% non fat milk powder /0.05% Tween 20 PBS between each incubation. Immuno-detection was carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescent system (ECL system, Amersham). The light produced by the ECL reaction was subjected to autoradiography using X-OMAT AR blue-light sensitive autoradiography film (Kodak Rochester, USA).

2.5. Gradient separation of E, uesicles and ghosts
A stock Percoll ~ (Seromed, Berlin) solution was made from 105 ml of Percoll ® (1.4 mg/ml), 7 ml of 0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 5.3 ml of 3 M NaC1, 3.5 ml of 4% glucose, 0.25 ml of 0.5 M EDTA. Distilled water was added to the stock PercolV~ solution in order to adjust the density to 1,0875. Approximately 35 ml of distilled water were needed yielding to a final volume of 156 ml. Ca-ion treated E, controls (non treated E) and density marker beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala) were carefully deposited on 6 ml of a Percoll ® solution containing 67 /~1 of 100 mM PMSC (Merck) and 267/zl of ten fold concentrated protease inhibitor cocktail kit (ICN), then centrifuged in polycarbonate tubes (Beckman) at 15,000 X g during 20 min at 4°C in a Beckman L5-65 ultracentrifuge (Rotor type TY65) (Lutz et al., 1992). Controls were realized in the same conditions by omitting protease inhibitors in the Percoll ~ solution. The different bands of interest were then collected,

J3D3 and J 3 B l l anti-CR1 MoAbs recognizing different epitopes of the molecule were used to quantify soluble CR1 antigenic sites in CRI ELISA. J3Bll MoAb was coated with 100 /zl (1.5 ~ g / w e l l in PBS, pH 7.9) on polystyrene microwell plates (Nunc Maxisorb immunoplates, Poly Labo Block, Strasbourg) over night at 4°C. Wells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, then saturated during one hour at 37°C using 200 ~1 of PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. The samples containing CR1 to be quantified were diluted in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Wells were washed three times in PBS0.05% BSA, then incubated with 100 /xl of biotinylated J3D3 (0.05 /xg/well) for one hour at 37°C. Wells were washed again three times in PBS-0.05% BSA, then incubated with streptavidine (0.05 /xg/well) (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C. After three washes, biotinylated phosphatase alkaline (Sigma) (0.05/xg/well) was added for 30 min at 37°C. After three washes, 150 /xl of 4 m g / m l paranitrophenylphosphate substrate diluted in alkaline buffer ® (Sigma) were incubated for 30 rain at 37°C. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm in each well on a microplate reader (SLT reader 340 ATCC, Salzburg). Soluble recombinant CR1 (CRls) was used as standard (a kind gift of E. Fischer).

were collected. The mean fluorescence channel was used for the quantification of the staining of a given sample.

2.9. Inhibition of C3b binding on rabbit anti-sheep E polyclonal antibody sensitized E by CR1 from vesicles
1 X l 0 9 sheep E were activated by incubation with a 500 fold diluted rabbit anti-sheep E polyclonal antibody (Sanofi Pasteur, Marne-la-Coquette) for 30 min at 37°C in 2 ml of distilled water containing 0.9% NaC1. Several tubes of 100 /.d of AE were incubated 30 rnin at 37°C with 5 /xl of C5 deficient human serum (a kind gift from patient D.D.) 100 fold diluted VBS +÷ and with 5 /~1 of non diluted vesicle containing supernatants from 5 x 108 E or with 5 /xl of serial dilutions in VBS ÷+ of vesicle containing supernatants (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 fold respectively) prepared as follows: 5 X 108 Ca-ion treated human E were centrifuged at 480 X g for 10 rain. Vesicle containing supernatant was then recovered and centrifuged 10,000 X g for 15 min. The pellet of vesicles was washed twice in VBS +÷, then resuspended in 50 /xl of VBS +÷. After 3 washes in VBS +÷, AE were incubated 30 min at 4°C with FITC conjugated anti-C3b MoAb (Immunotech, Marseille) diluted in PBS-1% BSA. After 3 washes in P B S - I % BSA, stained E were fixed using ice-cold 0.37% formaldehyde (Merck) PBS. Controls were performed in the same conditions but omitting one of the following steps: (i) activation of sheep E using rabbit anti-sheep E polyclonal antibody, (ii) incubation with C5 deficient human serum, (iii) incubation with vesicle containing supernatant from Ca-ion treated E or (iiii) incubation with FITC conjugated anti-C3b mouse MoAb (immunotech). Flow cytometry of stained cells was performed using a FACStar plus (Becton Dickinson). Ten thousand events of each sample were analyzed.

2.8. Indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry
E were analyzed for CR1 density level using indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry as previously described. 2 X 106 washed E were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 2 /~g of biotinylated J3D3 in PBS containing 1% BSA and washed 3 times in the same buffer. Fifty /xl of StreptA-PE (1.5 /.~g, TEBU, Le-Perray-en-Yvelines), 1 ~g of biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody and 50 /~1 of StreptA-PE (1.5 /xg) were then sequentially added and incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4°C. Stained E were fixed using ice-cold 0.37% formaldehyde (Merck) PBS. Flow cytometry of stained cells was performed using a FACStar plus (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). For each sample, at least 10,000 events

2.10. lmmuno-gold labeling of calcium ionophore treated E using J3D3 anti-CR1 MoAb
Two pA of Ca-ion treated pellet containing E and vesicles (E v) were washed twice in ice-cold PBS including 1% of a BSA (Sigma) (5 min, 780 X g).

E v were incubated in 50 /xl of P B S - I % BSA containing 2 /.tg of J3D3 mouse anti-CR1 M o A b for 45 min at 4°C. E v were then washed twice in ice-cold P B S - I % BSA, then incubated for 45 min at 4°C in 50 /zl of P B S - I % BSA containing 10 nm goldlabeled goat anti-mouse antibody (British Biocell, Cardiff) 10 fold diluted.

2.11. Electron microscopy
J3D3 mouse anti-CR1 M o A b and 10 nm goldlabeled goat anti-mouse antibody immuno-labeled E V were fixed in PBS containing 1% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde for 2 h at 4°C, then were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. E v were post-fixed in PBS including 1% of OsO 4 (Merck), then washed twice in ice-cold PBS. E v were pre-embedded in 20 /.tl PBS including 5.6% of B S A and 6.2% of glutaraldehyde. Resuspension of pellets was carefully avoided. Preembedded pellets were collected, then dehydrated in 70 ° , 80 ° , 90 ° , 95 ° and absolute ethanol successively, then embedded in Epon (Merck) at 60°C during 48 h. Ultra-thin sections ( 6 0 - 8 0 nm) were collected over copper grids. Grids were examined in a Jem 100C Jeol electron microscope (Jeol, Tokyo). Photographs were taken at magnifications between 8,300 X and 100,000 X .

2.12. Quantitative evaluation of CR1 immuno-gold labeling
The quantification of CR1 staining was performed on an image analyzer (Bio 500, Biocom, Les Ulis) using transmission electron micrographs of whole native E, Ca-ion treated E and vesicles, as well as a semi-automatic quantitative method (Bonnet et al., 1990). After image digitalization, analysis of labelling densities followed four steps: (i) identification and selection of the different cells or vesicles whose areas were defined and computed; (ii) extraction of the dense gold particles from background by thresholding images; (iii) a calibration was realized according to the magnification of each micrograph; (iiii) the quantification of the staining was expressed as the number of gold particles per/.tin 2 area.

polyclonal antibody sensitized E (Fig. 5). When vesicles originating from 5 × 108 human Ca-ion treated E were added to C5 deficient human serum, then incubated in the presence of AE, no C3b binding was observed. Using serial dilutions of vesicles, a dose dependent inhibition of binding was observed (Fig. 5). This experiment demonstrated that CR1 molecules from vesicles could still inhibit C3b binding on AE, serving as functional non degraded C3b/C4b receptor. Quantitative aspect and clustering distribution of CR1 on native E, Ca-ion treated E and vesicles were investigated using J3D3 anti-CR1 MoAb immunogold labelling on transmission electron microscopy. Fig. 6 shows that CR1 was more clustered on Ca-ion treated E than on native E (Fig. 6a), that the density of CR1 on vesicles was far higher than on E (Fig. 6b) and that more native E were labeled than Ca-ion treated E or vesicles (Fig. 6c). Fig. 7a-c depict the clustering of CRI during the formation of vesicles.

and 140 kDa degradation products (data not shown).Only a very small part, if any, of CR1 from Ca-ion treated E or vesicles was degraded (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4), when Percoll ® separation and membrane protein extraction were performed in the presence of protease inhibitors. No soluble CRI was found in the vesicle-depleted supernatants of Ca-ion treated E, even when 8 fold concentrated (Fig. 4, lane 3). On the other hand, when Percoll ® separation and membrane protein extraction were performed in the absence of protease inhibitors, significant proteolysis of CR1 on vesicles was observed (Fig. 4, lane 5). The function of CR1 molecules at the surface of vesicles was assessed by their ability to serve as an inhibitor of C3b binding on rabbit anti-sheep E

Several mechanisms such as membrane attack complex assembly (Sims and Wiedmer, 1986; Iida et al., 1991), ATP depletion, heating (Coakley et al., 1978), the calcium ionophore can lead to vesicle formation from E (Allan et al., 1976; Allan and Thomas, 1981; Test et al., 1991). All these procedures involve changes in calcium flow in the cell, and subsequent activation of calcium dependent proteases allowing them to cleave cytoskeleton elements. The subsequent events, particularly the molecules expressed on vesicles can thus be reasonably assumed to be similar, regardless of which vesicle inducing the procedure is used. Ca-ion induction of vesicles was chosen in this study in order to obtain reproducible vesicle formation and accurately quantify CR1 clustering and release. Quantitative data concerning CR1 on native or Ca-ion treated E established that CRI is preferentially removed from E through vesicle formation since there are less CR1 molecules on Ca-ion treated E than on native E. The simultaneous reduction of E volume through the vesicle formation is not sufficient to explain the loss of CR1 observed. The

138

preferential loss of DAF (CD55), protectin (CD59) and AChE has been previously reported (Dumaswala and Greenwalt, 1984; Biitikofer et al., 1989). All these molecules are GPI-anchored surface molecules, whereas CRI is a trans-membrane integral protein. Two hypotheses could explain the enrichment of CR1 molecules on vesicles: either (i) vesicles are formed around CR1 clusters. C activation through the uptake of opsonized IC makes bigger and thus more efficient clusters more likely to be located at the place of vesicle formation; or (ii) CR1 is fairly capable of capping into clusters at the surface of E during the Ca-ion induced vesicle process formation, migrating to membrane areas that will be removed as vesicles. CR1 decreases in an acquired manner with ageing on normal E (Ripoche and Sim, 1986; Moldenhauer et al., 1988; Cohen et al., 1992). E with a higher number of CR1 molecules loose more CR1 molecules than E with a lower number of CR1 molecules at their surface. This phenomenon is in the range of about one third of the total CR1 of young E. Ca-ion induced vesicle formation removed a similar amount of CR1 molecules in one hour, allowing speculation on the responsibility of this phenomenon in the overall decrease of CR1 when the E has faced various stresses including C attack during its life span. Quantitative staining in this study showed that CR1 is preferentially removed in clusters and that CR1 clusters are bigger on Ca-ion treated E than on native E, suggesting adaptive clustering on stressed E. Clusters of CR1 on vesicles are functional, inhibiting C3b deposition on sensitized E. In addition, there is no soluble CR1 further shed from vesicles or Ca-ion treated E. The epitope mapping of anti-CR1 MoAbs observed on papain-degraded CR1 was in accordance with the reported E1 l analysis of trypsin fragments of CRI (Sadallah et al., 1997a,b). Structural analysis by western blotting showed that CR1 retained its native structure during vesicle formation as well as during the extraction procedure when performed in the presence of protease inhibitors. This situation is representative of the large physiological excess of protease inhibitors in plasma in vivo. However, the rapid partial degradation of CR 1 from vesicles when processed in the absence of protease inhibitors sug-

gests that protease degradation of CR1 on E might also occur in some conditions where protease inhibitors might be lacking in the local environment of E. Nevertheless, CR1 clusters on E are able to take up opsonized IC and to contribute to the inactivation of C3b on immune complexes. When C3b inactivation is not sufficient, local terminal C complex attack could induce vesicle formation on which CR1 remain native and functional, able to carry opsonized IC, whilst vesicle-depleted E can escape C damage since they no longer retain at their surface opsonized IC, which include active enzyme C3b. In some situations, for instance, when monocytes in SLE patients are producing more reactive oxygen metabolites following IC uptake (Nielsen et al., 1997) some proteolysis of CR1 on vesicles might occur secondarily. In pathological conditions, such as SLE (Wilson et al., 1982; Ross et al., 1985; Walport et al., 1985; Cohen et al., 1989a) or HIV infection (Cohen et al., 1989a; Tausk et al., 1986), CR1 molecules decrease on E as an acquired phenomenon. This acquired decrease in CR1 density can extend to a total loss of CR1 from E. Kinetics experiments using Ca-ion induced vesicle formation suggested that nearly all CRI could be removed from E by this mechanism. Vesicle formation could be exacerbated in pathological conditions, although there has been as yet no evidence of the relevance of this phenomenon in the pathological decrease of CR1 observed in-vivo. The relative contribution of vesicle formation, surface proteolysis or other mechanisms in the acquired CR1 decrease in diseases remains to be investigated.
