Type 2 diabetes has rapidly reached an epidemic proportion becoming a major threat to global public health. PPAR agonists have emerged as a leading class of oral antidiabetic drugs. We report a structure biology analysis of novel indole-based PPAR agonists to explain the structure-activity relationships and present a critical analysis of reasons for change in selectivity with change in the orientation of the same scaffolds. The results would be helpful in designing novel PPAR agonists.
Introduction Type 2 diabetes has rapidly reached an epidemic proportion, becoming a major threat to global public health.1 The ligands targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor R/ (PPARR/ ) or PPARR// have shown promise in preclinical and clinical development, although some of these candidates were withdrawn due to adverse safety profiles.2-4 The efforts to develop a safe and effective dual PPARR/ agonist are continuing in view of the greater benefits offered by this class of compounds. We have recently reported a series of indole based PPAR pan agonists with the lead compound 1 (Figure 1) displaying potent glucose lowering efficacy and an excellent pharmacokinetic profile5 and 2 showing potent in vitro binding and functional activities.6 We had also reported the cocrystal structures of 1 and 2 to analyze the interactions with the PPAR protein. Here we present the effect of moving the acidic head moiety from the N1 position to the hydroxyl group of 4-, 5-, or 6-hydroxyindole and the tail part attached through a linker to the N1-positon of indole to determine the effect of this switch on the activity and selectivity with the aid of structural biology studies. This is the first report of detailed structural analysis of the PPAR agonists to explain the structure-activity relationships. The synthesis of novel indoleoxyacetic acids is also reported. Chemistry. Compounds 7-12 were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. The commercially available 4, 5, or 6-hydroxyindoles (3a-c) were alkylated with ethyl 2-bromoacetate or ethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropionate in the presence of an equimolar amount of potassium hydroxide in DMSO yielding 4a-f. Compounds 4a-f were alkylated with 1-bromo-3-chloropropane

Finally, 6a-f were deprotected by refluxing with lithium hydroxide in a methanol-water mixture to give the desired compounds 7-12. Results and Discussion The recently reported N1-substituted indole 2 showed potent activity against all three PPAR subtypes in binding and functional assays.6 To take advantage of the versatility of the indole scaffold, we moved the acidic headgroup to the hydroxyl group of 4, 5, or 6-hydroxyindoles, respectively, and the hydrophobic tail part was attached through a linker to the N1 position, thus effectively reversing the placement of substituents on indole as compared to 2. The compounds were screened in a cell-based transactivation assay5 for all three PPAR isoforms, as shown in Table 1. Upon placing the oxyacetic acid at the 5-position of the indole, compound 8 loses PPAR and PPAR functional activity but retains potent PPARR activity. The

4-position analogue, 7, also showed selective PPARR activity, while the 6-position analogue, 9, had weak functional activity against all three subtypes. Keeping in mind the selective PPARR activity of fibrates,7 we decided to introduce the dimethyl group on the oxyacetic acid in 7-9, to synthesize the fibrates 10-12, expecting to increase the PPARR activity and improve the selectivity. But to our surprise, the introduction of the fibrate moiety instead improved the PPAR binding and functional activity of all three analogues, thus resulting in dual PPARR/ agonists. The 5-substituted indole analogue 11 showed potent PPARR and PPAR functional activities. On moving the acidic head to the 4-position of the indole in compound 10, the PPAR activity improved 3-fold and it retained potent PPARR functional activity. Additionally, the 6-substituted analogue, 12, exhibited reversal of the relative PPARR/ functional activity, showing 2-fold better potency for PPAR as compared to PPARR. All the compounds showed weak or no PPAR activity. The change in selectivity and relative decrease in activity on reversing the position of the acidic head and hydrophobic tail on indole scaffold in comparison to 2 induced us to carry out a detailed structural biology study of the cocrystals of compounds 2, 8, and 10 with PPAR (Table 2). This would help to study the interactions of the ligand with the protein and also reveal the unusual role of the fibrate moiety in increasing the PPAR activity, as compared to other published fibrate analogues, and thus aid in the design of novel PPAR agonists. Superimposition of the cocrystallized structures of 2 and 8 with PPAR revealed the difference in their binding positions (Figure 2). The tail part of these two ligands superimposed reasonably well, whereas the linker and the head parts occupied different binding positions. In the 2-PPAR complex structure, the longer linker allowed the indole ring to move close to the AF2 helix and, consequently, enabled the carboxylic head of 2 to form H-bond interactions with His449 and Tyr473. This H-bonding pattern was conserved in most full PPAR agonist complex structures and, in some cases, an additional H-bond was formed with His323 or Ser289. Many reports have suggested the interactions with this conserved H-bonding rich area are important for the activities of PPAR agonists as this H-bonding network could stabilize the AF-2 helix in a conformation favoring the binding of coactivators to PPAR and, consequently, enhancing their recruitment.8,9 In contrast, in the 8-PPAR complex structure, with a linker one oxygen length shorter, the indole ring was moved away from the AF2 helix

In our recent report6 we had shown that the distances between the acidic group and the linker, when a ligand is complexed with the PPAR protein, were important for potent activity. We have now determined with the compounds described herein that a similar correlation exists for the distances between the carboxylic acid group and the methylene adjacent to the indole N1. As in our previous report, a distance close to 8-9 Å translated into potent PPAR activity. Distances longer than 9 Å, as in the case of compound 8, did not allow the molecule to orient properly in the PPAR binding pocket, thus limiting the interactions with the narrow acidic pocket of the LBD (Table 3). Conclusion In conclusion, the structure-activity relationship studies revealed that 5-substituted indoleoxyacetic acid analogue 8 is a potent and selective PPARR agonist. Incorporation of the dimethyl to form fibrate analogues unexpectedly increased the PPAR activity, giving PPARR/ dual agonists, with the 4-substituted indole analogue 10 being most potent. The change in potency and selectivity from PPAR pan agonist (2), to PPARR agonist (8), to PPARR/ agonist (10) was noted upon reversal of the orientation of the indole moiety in the indole-based PPAR agonists. The structural biology studies of the cocrystals of 2, 8, and 10 with PPAR-LBD showed that the H-bond interactions of the carboxylic acid groups with the AF-2 helix were the structural basis for the PPAR agonist activity. The repositioning of the carboxylic acid of 10 into the AF-2 helix due to the dimethyl group resulted in four H-bond interactions with key residues contributing to PPAR agonist activity. The proper orientation of the acidic head into the AF-2 helix can be indicated by the distance between the carboxylic group and the linker and should be around 8-9 Å for potent activity.

A mixture of 5-hydroxyindole (3b; 0.500 g, 3.76 mmol), powdered potassium hydroxide (0.316 g, 5.64 mmol), and DMSO (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, and then ethyl-2bromoisobutyrate (0.806 g, 4.14 mmol) was added. Stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h and then 15 mL of water was added. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 30 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with water (6 × 25 mL), followed by brine (2 × 20 mL), and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue flash chromatographed over silica gel, eluting with hexane/ethyl acetate (95:5) to give 4e (0.696 g, 75%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3)  1.28 (t, J ) 7.2 Hz, 3H), 1.57 (s, 6H), 4.27 (quartet, J ) 7.2 Hz, 2H), 6.42-6.43 (m, 1H), 6.84 (dd, J ) 2.4, 8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.12-

and subsequently resulted in the loss of H-bond interactions with PPAR. The absence of these critical H-bonding interactions with the protein might provide the structural basis for the much weaker transactivation activity of 8 for PPAR as compared with 2. Further, to elucidate the mechanism of the increase in PPAR activity upon the introduction of the fibrate moiety, we carried out a structural biology study of 10. The complex structure of 10 with PPAR was solved to 2.34 Å, and the electron density map of the compound is very defined. Comparison of the structures of 8 and 10 showed that the indole ring, linker, and tail parts superimposed very well with each other (Figure 3). However, a most significant difference occurred in the head part, particularly around the carboxylic acid. The dimethyl group in the fibrate moiety formed hydrophobic interactions with Phe282, Cys285, and Gln286 and shifted the carboxylic acid group closer to the AF-2 helix. The movement of the carboxylic acid group led to the formation of four strong H-bonding interactions with Ser289, His323, His449, and Tyr473. Therefore, introduction of the dimethyl group was able to reposition the carboxylic acid to the area where it could form the conserved H-bonding interactions with the key residues and, consequently, increase its activity toward PPAR.
