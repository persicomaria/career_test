The structure of the L1 metallo-b-lactamase from the opportunistic Ê pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been determined at 1.7 A resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) approach exploiting both the intrinsic binuclear zinc centre and incorporated selenomethionine residues. L1 is unique amongst all known b-lactamases in that it exists as a tetramer. The protein exhibits the ab/ba fold found only in the metallo-b-lactamases and displays several unique features not previously observed in these enzymes. These include a disulphide bridge and two substantially elongated loops connected to the active site of the enzyme. Two closely spaced zinc ions are bound at the active site with tetrahedral (Zn1) and trigonal bipyramidal (Zn2) co-ordination, respectively; these are bridged by a water molecule which we propose acts as the nucleophile in the hydrolytic reaction. Ligation of the second zinc ion involves both residues and geometry which have not been previously observed in the metallo-b-lactamases. Simulated binding of the substrates ampicillin, ceftazidime and imipenem suggests that the substrate is able to bind to the enzyme in a variety of different conformations whose common features are direct interactions of the b-lactam carbonyl oxygen and nitrogen with the zinc ions and of the b-lactam carboxylate with Ser187. We describe a catalytic mechanism whose principal features are a nucleophilic attack of the bridging water on the b-lactam carbonyl carbon, electrostatic stabilisation of a negatively charged tetrahedral transition state and protonation of the b-lactam nitrogen by a second water molecule co-ordinated by Zn2. Further, we propose that direct metal:substrate interactions provide a substantial contribution to substrate binding and that this may explain the lack of speci®city which is a feature of this class of enzyme.

concern. Since the initial discovery of Zn-dependent b-lactamase activity in innocuous strains of Bacillus cereus (Kubawara & Abraham, 1967) it has become apparent that these enymes are responsible for antibiotic resistance in an increasing number of pathogenic bacteria including the Klebsiella, Serratia, Pseudomonas/Stenotrophomonas and Bacteriodes genera (Senda et al., 1996; Ito et al., 1995; Watanabe et al., 1991; Bandoh et al., 1992). The principal clinical relevance in all of these cases is the activity of metallo-b-lactamases (class B, Ambler (1980) or group 3, Bush et al. (1995)) against the carbapenems or third generation penicillins. These compounds are of great clinical importance because

126 they are poorly hydrolysed by the better-characterised active-site serine enzymes (Rasmussen & Bush, 1997). It is also becoming apparent that the metallo-b-lactamase genes are being disseminated by both plasmid (Ito et al., 1995) and integronborne (Senda et al., 1996) mechanisms. This is likely to lead to an increasing incidence of metallo-b-lactamase mediated antibiotic resistance in more aggressive pathogens, further reducing the choice of available antibacterial agents. To date there remain no clinically useful metallo-b-lactamase inhibitors. Kinetic studies on the metallo-b-lactamases (Felici et al., 1993) show that these proteins possess an exceptionally broad pro®le of activity. The only exceptions are the enzymes from the Aeromonas species which function as rather speci®c ``imipenemases'' (Felici et al., 1993; Walsh et al., 1996). It is also evident that whilst all metallo-b-lactamases require zinc, the stoichiometry which is necessary for full activity varies such that the protein from Aeromonas hydrophila functions with a single zinc ion bound, that from Bacillus cereus may utilise one but requires two zinc ions for optimal ef®ciency and those from Bacteriodes fragilis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia require two (Davies & Abraham, 1974; Crowder et al., 1996, 1998; Valladares et al., 1997). In the light of these data it has been suggested that the catalytic ef®ciency of metallob-lactamases is correlated with their af®nity for the second zinc (Concha et al., 1996). Crystal structures exist for two metallo-b-lactamases: the enzymes from B. cereus 569/H (Car® et al., 1995, 1998b) and from B. fragilis (Concha et al., 1996, 1997; Car® et al., 1998a). The overall fold for these molecules is an ab/ba motif which is, at present, unique to the metallo-b-lactamases. The polypeptide chain is divided into two domains whose central b-sheets obey an approximate 2-fold symmetry relationship. The interface of these two b-sheets forms the hydrophobic core of the molecule whilst the active site lies in a groove running between them and is associated with a number of loops which bear the residues associated with zinc binding. The sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures of these two enzymes are very similar although there are some differences between them at their active sites. The B. cereus structure from crystals grown at pH 5.6 (Car® et al., 1995) contains a single zinc ion co-ordinated in a distorted tetrahedral fashion by three histidine residues and a water molecule. More recent work has established that it is also possible to crystallise, at higher pH values, a form of this enzyme in which two zinc ions are bound in a near-identical fashion to the B. fragilis active site (Car® et al., 1998b; Fabiane, et al., 1998). In the B. fragilis structure by Concha et al. (1996), crystallised at pH 7.0, a binuclear zinc centre is observed in which the ®rst zinc ion is tetrahedrally co-ordinated by the equivalent three histidine residues and a single water molecule. The second zinc ion is co-ordinated in a pentavalent distorted trigonal bipyramidal conformation by the

same water molecule (which thus ``bridges'' the two zinc ions), one further water molecule, and a His, Cys, Asp triad, which is conserved across the majority of metallo-b-lactamase sequences. The kinetic work of Waley and co-workers, carried out at low temperature or on manganese or cobalt-substituted forms of the B. cereus enzyme (Bicknell & Waley, 1985; Bicknell et al., 1986) suggested that the reaction was likely to proceed through non-covalent rather than covalent intermediates and might involve changes in the geometry of zinc co-ordination. More recently it has been proposed that the enzyme may function with either one or two zinc ions (Car® et al., 1995, 1998a). Accordingly, b-lactam substrates are bound such that the b-lactam carbonyl oxygen interacts with Zn1 and the conserved Asn at position 180 (B. cereus numbering), whilst the carboxylate group interacts with either His210 (in the single-zinc form) or Zn2. The water molecule bound to Zn1 (or bridging water in the two-zinc form) is deprotonated by Asp90 and makes a nucleophilic attack on the b-lactam carbonyl carbon. This creates a tetrahedral intermediate which decays when Asp90 donates a proton back to the b-lactam nitrogen (thus functioning as a proton shuttle) with concommitant cleavage of the carbon-nitrogen bond and opening of the b-lactam ring. In contrast, Concha et al. (1996, 1997) propose that the pKa value of the bridging water will be suf®ciently altered for it to exist as a hydroxide without deprotonation by Asp86 (B. fragilis numbering). Substrate is bound through interaction of the carbonyl oxygen with Zn1 and the carboxylate with Lys167. The bridging water (or ``shared hydroxide'') makes an equivalent attack at the carbonyl carbon to form a tetrahedral intermediate. This is stabilised by an oxyanion hole formed by Zn1 and Asn176; protonation of the nitrogen is by the ``apical'' water ligand of Zn2. Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia has emerged as a signi®cant hospital-derived or nosocomial pathogen of immunocompromised hosts such as cancer, cystic ®brosis and transplant patients (Benson et al., 1996; Denton, 1997). The antibiotic resistance of this organism is reported to be conferred by a pair of co-ordinately expressed chromosomal proteins; a class 2e serine b-lactamase termed L2 and a group 3a metallo-b-lactamase termed L1 (Walsh et al., 1994, 1997). Within the sub-class of metallo-b-lactamases, however, the L1 protein possesses several unique distinctions. The level of sequence identity is greatly reduced compared to that between other members of the group. The L1 protein contains a number of substitutions at sites thought to be important for metallo-b-lactamase function: in particular at position 184 where L1 lacks the cysteine proposed to be important for zinc co-ordination; at 187 where a lysine thought to be critical for substrate binding is absent; and at 163 where an aspartate identi®ed by crystallographic (Concha et al., 1996) and mutagenic analyses of the B. fragilis protein (Crowder

et al., 1996) as important for orienting zinc ligands is replaced by glycine. In common with other metallo-b-lactamases, L1 is localised to the periplasm of the host organism (Bicknell et al., 1985; Walsh et al., 1994) and therefore undergoes posttranslational N-terminal cleavage. The mature protein is longer by 37 residues than any of the other four known group 3a sequences. Gel ®ltration data are consistent with the protein existing as a tetramer in solution (Bicknell et al., 1985; Saino et al., 1992; Paton et al., 1994) though there is no evidence of allosteric effects on activity. All other b-lactamases, whether metallo or active-site serine, are monomeric. The enzyme has a catalytic ef®ciency comparable with that of the other group 3a proteins (Felici et al., 1993) and is active against a wide range of penicillin and cephalosporin substrates. We present here the re®ned crystal structure of the tetrameric metallo-b-lactamase L1 Ê from S. maltophilia at 1.7 A resolution.

Results
Overall structure Electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy con®rmed that the 21 amino-terminal amino acid residues of the leader sequence were removed posttranslationally. Of the remaining 269 amino acids, good electron density was observed for residues 2 to 267, permitting an uninterrupted trace of the polypeptide chain. Approximately 91% of amino acid residues display conformations within the highly favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot with just one residue, Asp53, lying outside the allowed regions. This residue is conserved and adopts a sterically strained conformation in both the B. cereus and B. fragilis structures (Car® et al., 1995; Concha et al., 1996). The relevance of this observation will be discussed below. The crystals used in this study belong to the space group P6422 with one L1 monomer in each asymmetric unit. The nature of the symmetry operators in this space group is such that there are two types of centre in the unit cell which contain three orthogonal and intersecting 2-fold axes. One set of these crystallographic dyads generates a tight packing tetrameric arrangement of L1, but the interactions involved may or may not represent how the molecule exists in solution. In order to determine the oligomerisation status de®nitively sedimentation equilibrium measurements were carried out (see Figure 1). The data ®t extremely well to a model comprising a single species of molecular mass 114,838 Da, i.e. that of the L1 tetramer. In contrast, more loosely associated or asymmetric species would by this method conform, respectively, to models containing more than one state or of greater apparent molecular mass. The experiment therefore con®rms that the close-packed arrangement observed in the crystal corresponds to the physiological state.

The 3D structure of the L1 monomer is shown as a ribbon representation in Figure 2, together with the structures of the metallo-b-lactamases from B. fragilis and B. cereus. The overall fold of the molecule may be described as an ab/ba sandwich. The structure divides into two near-equivalent domains, each of which comprises an antiparallel b-sheet and two a-helices. These helices pack against each other in a parallel fashion in the Nterminal domain but antiparallel in the C-terminal domain. A ®fth helix, a3, runs between the two domains and sits adjacent to the catalytic site which lies within a shallow groove formed at the interface of the two b-sheets. In addition, three short lengths of 310 helix are positioned prior to b1, a1 and a5, respectively. Comparison of this structure with those from B. cereus (Car® et al., 1995) and B. fragilis (Concha et al., 1996) shows that the overall fold is conserved in spite of the distant sequence relationship. Nevertheless, it is clear that whilst the structures of the metallo-b-lactamases from B. cereus and B. fragilis are extremely similar to each other, that of S. maltophilia L1 is distinct from both of these in several important regards. In L1 the b-sheet of the N-terminal domain contains four rather than ®ve strands prior to the ®rst alpha helix. Furthermore, the C-terminal helix a5 and the loops between a3 and b7 and between b12 and a5 are considerably elongated, allowing the structure to accomodate the additional 37 (c.f. B. fragilis) or 42 (c.f. B. cereus) amino acids of the mature polypeptide. A single intramolecular disulphide brige links the two cysteine residues 218 and 246, and may serve to constrain the second of these long loops. This disulphide bond is not present in the

metallo-b-lactamases from either B. fragilis or B. cereus. Sequence comparison also suggests that it is absent in the enzymes from A. hydrophila and S. marescens and thus that it is unique to the L1 protein. The quaternary structure of the molecule is depicted in Figure 3. Tetramerisation is achieved by three discrete sets of interactions enabling each subunit to contact each of the other three. The contacts are predominantly hydrophobic in nature Ê and result in each subunit burying 1300 A2 of nonpolar side-chain surface area on formation of the tetramer. The principal contact at the interface between the A and B subunits is made by the sidechain of Met140A which penetrates a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the B molecule formed by Leu122, Pro162 and Pro200 and Tyr199. Additional residues, located predominantly in the region

between the two domains of the monomer comprising the C-terminal end of the a3 helix (positions Ala108A, Glu109A and Val112A) and Ile138A in strand b7, pack against the equivalent positions in the B chain. Similarly, two sets of inter-subunit contacts comprise the interface between the A and C chains. Of these, the most striking interactions involve the N-terminal 15 residues of each chain which form extended U-shaped structures mutually stabilised by both electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions. Two prominent leucines at positions 5 and 8 are docked into apolar cavities on the surface of the opposing subunit formed by the side-chains of residues at the more distal end of this structure (Ala10, Tyr11 and Ala15) and at the N-terminal end of a1 (Met56, Pro57, Gln58, Met59 and His62). This is the principal area of contact between the A and C (and, of course, the B and D) chains and Ê accounts for 600 A2 of buried hydrophobic surface per monomer. A further interaction is formed by the side-chain of Pro132A with those of residues Pro132C and Arg116C. Contact between the A and D subunits is limited to a number of hydrogen bonds of which the major contributors are Arg75 and Asp78.

Discussion
The active site The geometry of the active site is super®cially reminiscent of that observed in the B. fragilis structure of Concha et al. (1996). The two zinc ions are Ê separated by a distance of 3.4 A and co-ordinated, respectively, in tetrahedral and a distorted trigonal bipyramidal fashion as is shown in Figure 4. Details of the zinc co-ordination geometry are given in Table 1. For the tetrahedral zinc ion (Zn1) co-ordination is by the conserved histidine triad at positions 84, 86 and 160 and the bridging water, Wat1 (the equivalent of the shared hydroxide described by Concha et al. (1996)). The pentavalent

129 positions in the trigonal bipyramidal co-ordination of Zn2 are occupied by the conserved residues His206 and Cys164 and the shared hydroxide. In the active site of the more recent B. cereus structure (Car® et al, 1998b) in which both zinc sites are fully occupied and which may be almost exactly superimposed with that of the B. fragilis enzyme the equivalent ligands are His210, Cys168 and a bicarbonate ion. The axial or apical positions are ®lled by the conserved Asp at 86 (B. fragilis) or 90 (B. cereus) and an additional apical water. In the S. maltophilia active site the conserved protein ligands are His225 and Asp88. However, the structure comparison shows that this aspartate cannot be superimposed with the equivalent acidic residue in the two other enzymes. Asp88 adopts a position unique to the S. maltophilia L1 enzyme. The reason for this is likely to be the substitution of Cys164 (B. fragilis)/Cys168 (B. cereus) for Ser185 in L1, which is able to act as a ligand only indirectly through the hydrogen-bonded water, Wat2, which occupies an apical position. Co-ordination of Zn2 is completed by His89 acting as an equatorial protein ligand. This ®fth ligand (His89) in the S. maltophilia L1 protein is therefore provided from a completely different region of sequence to the ®fth ligand in either B. cereus (Cys168) or B. fragilis (Cys164). The effect is that whilst Asp88 and Wat2 are retained as apical (rather than planar) ligands, the positions of the three planar ligands Wat1, His89 and His225 are moved such that the entire plane has undergone a rotation of approximately 76 about the Wat1 ± Zn2 bond. Although Asp88 has been repositioned it is noteworthy that there has been some rotation of the side-chain of this residue such that the interaction between the OD1 and the hydrolytic or bridging water is retained. An additional feature of the metal co-ordination is the distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry about Zn2. The angle Wat1-Zn2-His225 at 146 is substantially larger, whilst the angle His225-Zn2His89 is at 102 is much smaller than the ideal value of 120 . The apical ligands Asp88 and Wat2 are approximately 14 away from colinearity. Additionally the distance between Zn2 and the apiÊ cal water Wat2 is at 2.4 A is signi®cantly longer than for the other four ligands. Both of these obser-

Broken lines represent co-ordination and hydrogen bonds. The water molecule referred to in the text as Wat1 is that bridging the two zinc ions, whilst that referred to as Wat2 links Zn2 with Ser185.

(trigonal bipyramidal) zinc ion (Zn2) is ligated by Wat1, an additional water molecule Wat2 (equivalent to the apical water described by Concha et al. (1996)), the conserved residues Asp88 and His225, and an additional histidine at position 89. If the active sites are compared for the enzymes from S. maltophilila and B. fragilis as shown in Figure 5, it is apparent that the structure reported here is substantially different from those previously reported. The tetrahedral zinc ion Zn1 and associated ligands in both structures are fairly similar and the position of the bridging water or shared hydroxide is little changed between them. It is at the trigonal bipyramidal zinc ion Zn2 and more particularly at the positions of the co-ordinating ligands that the most signi®cant differences occur.

vations may be of mechanistic relevance as will be discussed later. Orientation of the zinc ligands is maintained by an extensive hydrogen bonding network and additional hydrophobic interactions. Each histidine ligand is hydrogen-bonded, either directly or through a connecting water molecule, to an aspartate group or main-chain oxygen. Details are given in Table 1. These interactions serve to position and orient the zinc ligands and help to maintain the necessary tautomer of the histidine side-chains. This is because the histidine residues can only coordinate to the zinc ions through their unprotonated nitrogen. The aromatic residues Phe124 and Trp17 are additionally positioned such that they may make stabilising edge-face contacts with His86 and His225, respectively (see Figure 4). Although a hydrogen-bonding network about the zinc ligands is also a prominent feature of the B. fragilis active site model proposed by Concha et al (1996), it appears to involve different interactions. Asp53 of L1 is unusual in that it is the only residue lying outside the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The equivalent aspartic acid residue adopts similar sterically strained conformations in both the B. cereus and B. fragilis structures (Car® et al., 1995; Concha et al., 1996). In the L1 structure the side-chain of Asp53 makes

hydrogen bonds with the main-chain amide and side-chain of Ser83 and with a water molecule (Wat23). Intriguingly, this water occupies almost exactly the same position as a Na in the B. fragilis structure which also interacts with the equivalent aspartic acid residue. In the B. fragilis structure the Na is penta-co-ordinated and is believed to be important in the orientation of three zinc liganding groups. However, the four other groups in the B. fragilis structure which co-ordinate the Na are not conserved in L1. In the L1 structure Wat23 is hydrogen-bonded by both Asp53 and His89 ND1, and by this means it appears that this acidic residue acts indirectly to stabilise the appropriate tautomeric form of the histidine. The other hydrogen bonds that Asp53 make appear to be important in stabilisation of the structure of the molecule close to its active site. Mode of substrate binding and mechanistic considerations The results of Monte-Carlo simulations in which the substrates ampicillin, ceftazidime and imipenem were docked into the active site and subjected to energy minimisation are shown in Figure 6. The Figure shows an ensemble of the lowest energy structures generated by this procedure. In the case

131 (Concha et al., 1997), we propose that direct interactions between the substrate carbonyl oxygen and Zn1 and the b-lactam nitrogen and Zn2 provide the major contributions to binding energy. Binding of substrate therefore changes the co-ordination state of the two zinc ions such that it becomes ®vefold (trigonal bipyramidal) about Zn1 and sixfold (octahedral) about Zn2. The most signi®cant additional contact is that between the substrate carboxyl group (conserved among b-lactam antibiotics) and Ser187. The absence of further, speci®c protein: substrate interactions thus provides an explanation for the exceptionally broad pro®le of compounds against which these enymes are active. The binding interactions outlined above also serve to orient approximately the substrate carbonyl carbon for nucleophilic attack by the bridging water, which we believe will exist as the OHÀ species. This produces a tetrahedral transition state in which the carbonyl oxygen molecule exists as an oxyanion. The models described by Concha et al. (1996, 1997) and Car® et al. (1995, 1998a) postulate that this species makes additional interactions with the conserved Asn at position 180 (B. cereus) or 176 (B. fragilis), which together with Zn1 forms an oxyanion hole. The equivalent residue (Asn196) is conserved in the S. maltophilia L1 enzyme but its sideÊ chain is 14 A away from the substrate carbonyl oxygen molecule. A large scale motion of the loop between residues 183 and 202 would therefore be required in order to bring Asn196 into a position where it could make additional stabilising contacts with the oxyanion (see Figure 2). Though such a profound rearrangement falls outside the scope of the modelling procedure employed and therefore cannot be ruled out, the data suggest an alternative possibility. In L1, we propose that the oxyanion is stabilised by interaction with the side-chain of Tyr191, either directly or through a water molecule, and by the positive dipole formed at the amino terminus of the short helical turn made by residues 86 to 91. Product formation occurs upon breakage of the carbon-nitrogen bond of the b-lactam ring. This requires donation of a proton to the nitrogen. From the ensemble of ampicillin structures the nearest Ê potential donor is Wat2, approximately 3.5 A distant. Concha et al. (1996, 1997) make a similar proposal despite the different arrangement of ligands about Zn2 in the B. fragilis structure compared with the S. maltophilia L1. It is likely that in L1 this protonation step may be favoured by the interaction of Wat2 with Ser185 which may aid both its positioning and orientation. It is noteworthy that the bond between Wat2 and Zn2 is signi®cantly longer than those of the other co-ordinating ligands. In addition, the formation of the oxyanion transition state is likely to be accompanied by a loss of co-ordination of Zn1 by the carbonyl oxygen as the geometry about the carbonyl carbon alters from planar to tetrahedral. A consequence of this is a rearrangement of ligands about Zn1. Wat2 is well positioned to interact with

of ampicillin, eight conformers arise within an energy range of 88 kcal/mol, for ceftazidime there are six structures within 24 kcal/mol, and for imipenem there are ten structures across just 7 kcal/ mol. In the latter case, clustering of many conformers within a tight energy band is due to the lack of bulky substituents in the imipenem structure. For all three substrates it is apparent that there is no one favoured conformation for binding and that substrate molecules may instead adopt any one of numerous conformations each capable of making productive interactions. Given the assumptions made during the docking procedure (that the shared hydroxide is likely to function as the nucleophile and that Zn1 is important in positioning the b-lactam carbonyl oxygen), the most important additional interaction appears to be a hydrogen bond between Ser187 and the b-lactam carboxylate moiety. This position is occupied by a lysine in all other metallo-b-lactamase sequences (position167 in the B. fragilis sequence and 171 in B. cereus), which makes a similar contact in the model for substrate binding proposed by Concha et al., (1996). A further effect of these contacts is that the b-lactam nitrogen is itself brought into close proximity with Zn2. For example, in the lowest energy ampicillin conformer the distance between the b-lactam N and Zn2 is Ê approximately 2.8 A. The distorted geometry observed around Zn2 in the absence of substrate leaves this ion open to the approach of an additional ligand (i.e. b-lactam) from a direction opposite to His89. Only minor adjustments are required for Zn2 to adopt octahedral co-ordination. Binding of the more hydrophobic b-substituted substrates, ampicillin and ceftazidime, appears to be facilitated by the proximity of hydrophobic surfaces. The most prominent of these is formed by Phe124 and Ile128. These two residues form part of the loop between a3 and b7 (residues 116 to 137), which is considerably extended in this enzyme compared to all other members of the class, with the exception of the proteins from the Aeromonas species. More minor interactions (those adopted by smaller numbers of conformers) are those of the aromatic substituent of ampicillin with Tyr11 and of the pyridine ring of ceftazidime with either Trp17 or His225. The overall conclusion from the simulation studies is that there appears to be no well-de®ned substrate conformation required for binding whilst the open active-site groove is surrounded by numerous hydrophobic groups capable of contributing to binding of substrates with a wide variety of substituents. Both of these factors could contribute to the broad spectrum of activity which is observed with this enzyme. Combination of structural, modelling and existing kinetic data permits some conclusions to be drawn regarding the likely mechanism of b-lactam hydrolysis by L1. These are shown schematically in Figure 7. Given the failure of our own and others' attempts to obtain crystallographic information regarding modes of substrate binding

Figure 7. Proposed mechanism for b-lactam hydrolysis by the S. maltophilia L1 metallo-b-lactamase. The protein residues S187 and Y191 are shown ringed in those states where they do not interact with the substrate. Protein in the absence of bound substrate is shown at bottom left with tetrahedral co-ordination about Zn1 and trigonal bipyramidal co-ordination about Zn2. Binding of substrate (top left) is facilitated by interaction of Zn1 with the b-lactam carbonyl oxygen atom, Zn2 with b-lactam nitrogen and Ser187 with b-lactam carboxylate and so, in this complex, Zn1 is ®vefold and Zn2 sixfold co-ordinated. The bridging hydroxide (Wat1) is positioned to make a nucleophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl carbon. In the transition state complex (top right) the geometry of the substrate carbonyl carbon alters from planar to tetrahedral, breaking the co-ordination of Zn1 by the carbonyl oxygen atom. The oxyanion is stabilised by interaction with Tyr191 and the positive dipole at the N terminus of the helical turn formed by residues 86 to 91. The apical water Wat2 is acidi®ed by proximity to both Zn ions and protonates the b-lactam nitrogen, leaving a hydroxide ion bridging the two zinc ions. Finally the apical position about Zn2 is ®lled from bulk solvent (bottom right).

Zn1 in the transition state complex, forming a contact which would make Wat2 more likely to protonate the amide nitrogen. Protonation of the b-lactam nitrogen leaves Wat2 in position as a hydroxide bridging the two zinc ions. On dissociation of product Wat2 therefore becomes equivalent to the ground state bridging ligand Wat1, and the incoming ligand at the apical position about Zn2 is recruited from the bulk solvent. The alternative suggestion is that the conserved Asp residue (position 88 in L1) acts as a proton shuttle by accepting a proton from the bridging water and back-donating it to the b-lactam nitrogen (Car® et al., 1995, 1998a). Although it appears likely that OD1 of Asp88 assists in the orientation of the hydroxide nucleophile, it seems unlikely that the pKa value of an aspartate in this environment (facing two Zn2) will be suitable for it to act as a proton shuttle. Also, as modelled, the b-lactam Ê amide nitrogen is 4.6 A from Asp88 OD1 whereas Ê from Wat2. it is just 3.5 A

An interesting analogy may be made between L1 and the binuclear zinc enzyme phosphotriesterase which, in the unliganded form, contains a pair of zinc ions co-ordinated in a similar tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal environment (Vanhooke et al., 1996). Kinetic and crystallographic investigation of the mode of substrate binding of this enzyme has suggested that the major contribution is derived from direct interaction of substrate with both zinc centres. Further, phosphotriesterase is characterised by an extremely broad substrate pro®le (Hong & Raushel, 1996), which is believed to result from the limited contribution of speci®c protein groups to binding. It should, however, be noted that in contrast to the metallo-b-lactamases phosphotriesterase has been successfully co-crystallised in the presence of substrate analogues, albeit with very high crystallographic B-factors for these compounds (Vanhooke et al., 1996). The hypothesis that direct substrate interactions with the binuclear zinc centre comprise the major

10,000 rpm. The protein partial speci®c volume and the solvent density were calculated from tabulated values (Laue et al., 1992). After centrifugation for 20 hours cells were scanned radially every two hours (l  280 nm) until no further change in the absorbance pro®le was observed. The molecular mass was derived by direct non-linear ®tting of this ®nal equilibrium pro®le (A versus r) using an ideal single species model in the program ORIGIN. Crystallisation Crystallisation was identical for both native and Sesubstituted proteins. Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method at 4 C. Protein solution was concentrated to 16 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM ZnSO4, 1 mM bME; 1 ml of this was mixed with 1 ml of reservoir solution (100 mM Hepes (pH 7.75), 2.0 M (NH4)2SO4, 1.5% (v/v) PEG400) and equilibrated for one week against 500 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6422 with unit cell dimensions Ê Ê a  b  105 A, c  98 A and attained a maximum size of 70 mm Â 70 mm Â 440 mm. Data collection and processing All data were collected at 100 K on ¯ash-frozen crystals maintained at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems liquid nitrogen cryostat. Crystals were removed from the drop, equilibrated ten minutes in cryobuffer (mother liquor with addition of 25% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant) and mounted in 0.2 or 0.4 mm diameter nylon loops (Hampton Research) glued to glass capillary tubes. Native data were collected at station 7.2 of the Daresbury synchrotron radiation source (SRS) and at station EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) X11 of the Deutsches Electronen-Synchrotron (DESY) source at Hamburg in both cases recording on a 300 mm MAR Research image plate. MAD data sets were collected at station EMBL X31 of the DESY source on a 180 mm MAR Research image plate. Five separate data sets were collected at wavelengths corresponding to the in¯ection Ê Ê points ( f H ; 1.2835 A and 0.9801 A) and peaks ( f HH ; Ê Ê 1.2821 A and 0.9797 A) of the Zn and Se absorption edges, respectively, and an additional high-energy Ê remote point at a wavelength of 0.9200 A (Table 2). Intensity data were integrated and subsequently scaled and merged using using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK, respectively (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996). MAD phasing Since attempts to solve the structure of L1 by both molecular replacement and heavy-atom derivatisation were unsuccesful, the structure was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method (MAD). Crystals were prepared from seleno-methionine substituted protein which enabled us to exploit the anomalous scattering from both the incorporated Se and the intrinsic zinc ions. Appropriate wavelengths for optimised signals from f H and f HH at both types of anomalous edge were determined by collecting ¯uoresence emission spectra directly from the frozen crystal on station EMBL X31 DESY, Hamburg. Five diffraction datasets were collected from the crystal including a high-energy remote wavelength set. The two Zn sites were identi®ed by inspection of an anomalous difference Patterson calculated using

contribution to substrate binding could also explain the unusual properties of the metallo-b-lactamase from the Aeromonas genus. Recent data (Valladares et al., 1997) demonstrate that this enzyme possesses optimal activity with a single zinc ion bound, and is inhibited by occupation of a second, low af®nity zinc site. In contrast to all other members of the group, this protein acts as a far more speci®c imipenemase and is active against only a narrow spectrum of b-lactam substrates. The inference is that the loss of direct metal-substrate contacts has been overcome by an increase in speci®c protein:substrate interactions leading to preservation of catalytic ef®ciency at the expense of a greatly reduced spectrum of activity.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, over-expression and protein purification Cloning and expression of the S. maltophilia L1 gene has been described elsewhere (Crowder et al., 1998). A modi®ed protocol was adopted for puri®cation. Plasmid PUB 5832 was transformed into the expression strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). A single colony of BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells was used to inoculate 50 ml of terri®c broth (Tartof & Hobbs, 1987) and grown overnight at 37 C with shaking. Ten millilitres per litre of this culture was used to inoculate a total of four litres. Cells were grown until absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6 ± 0.8, and induced with 1 mM IPTG. After a further three hours growth the culture was harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mM ZnSO4, 1 mM b-mercaptoethonol (bME) containing 1 mM Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim) and the cells lysed by sonication. Debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. Flow-through was collected, dialysed against 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 5 mM ZnSO4, 1 mM bME; loaded onto an S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted on a 0 to 500 mM NaCl gradient. Fractions containing L1 protein were dialysed against acetate buffer as described above at pH 6.0, loaded onto a POROS 50HS column running on a BioCad workstation (Perseptive Biosystems) and eluted on a 0 to 400 mM NaCl gradient. Active fractions were loaded onto a Superdex-200 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 0.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM ZnSO4, 1 mM bME and eluted in the same buffer. Sample purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Production of selenium-incorporated protein was identical to that described above, except that B843 (DE3) cells (Novagen) were grown at 30 C in minimal media supplemented with Se-DL-methionine (Sigma) according to the methods described by Hendrickson et al. (1990). Sedimentation equilibrium Protein samples for sedimentation equilibrium (0.5 to 1.0 mg/ml) were prepared by exhaustive dialysis against a buffer blank 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM ZnSO4. Experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge with the temperature maintained at 293 K and rotor speed

the f HH amplitudes. These two Zn sites were then re®ned Zn in MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991) with the f HZn, f HH and Zn fremote datasets to generate phases for subsequent calculation of a dispersive difference Fourier using the coef®cients Ff H Se À Fremote. This map revealed the positions of ®ve, of a potential six, Se sites. The ®ve Se and two Zn sites were then re®ned in MLPHARE against the ®ve different wavelength datasets producing ®nal empirical Ê phases with an overall Figure of merit of 0.79 to 3.0 A. These phases were further re®ned and extended by density modi®cation procedures using DM (Cowtan, 1994) against the remote wavelength data set which was collected to somewhat higher resolution. The resulting elecÊ tron density map at 2.85 A was readily interpretable and most of the ®nal model was built in the ®rst round. The model was subjected to alternate cycles of re®nement and water molecule addition using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1994) and ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993). This re®nement was carried out against data to Ê 1.7 A collected from a native crystal but also included, Ê as targets, the DM-modi®ed (3 A) empirical phases. The inclusion of this phase information enabled the REFMAC/ARP re®nement procedure to converge accurately starting from a rather crudely built initial model. This re®nement procedure did not work if the phase restraints were not included. Statistics for the phasing and re®nement are presented in Table 2. Molecular modelling Initial docking of ligands was carried out manually using the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, San Diego) to position the b-lactam carbonyl carbon in close proximity to the shared hydroxide and the carbonyl oxygen close to Zn1. Large numbers of conformations were then generated using a Monte-Carlo procedure to vary torsion angles of groups exocyclic to the b-lactam ring; the entire system was then subjected

to Adopted Basis Newton-Raphson minimisation (Brooks et al., 1983) until the potential gradient was less than or equal to 0.01 kcal/mol. Constraints were applied Ê such that all atoms within 6 A of the ligand were conÊ strained by a harmonic force of 5 kcal/mol per A, both Zn atoms, the shared hydroxide and the b-lactam carbonyl carbon and oxygen atoms by a force of 10 kcal/mol Ê per A and the remainder of the ligand left free to move. The empirical energy function of the program CHARMM (Brooks et al., 1983) was employed with the TIP3P model for water (Jorgensen et al., 1983) and the parameter set 19 for the protein (Neria et al., 1996) in which only polar hydrogen atoms were explicitly modelled. Screening due to bulk solvent was simulated by employing a radially dependent dielectric constant scaled down fourfold. Non-bonded interactions were truncated employing a potential that shifted all electrostatic interactions up to Ê 12 A and switched the van der Waals interactions Ê Ê between 8 A and 12 A (Brooks et al., 1983; Lonchariach & Broooks, 1989). Co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the protein data bank with the accession numbers 1sml and r1smlsf, respectively, and will be held for 1 year prior to release.
