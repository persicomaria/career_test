1. Introduction

In electron microscopy of biological macromolecules the resolution depends on two factors: (a) the resolving power of the instrument, and (b) the resolution of the specimen preparation technique. Modern transmission electron microscopes operating at 100 kV are capable of a point-to-point resolution better than 0.2 nm. Unfortunately the situation is far less satisfactory where specimen preparation procedures are concerned and the routine shadowing and staining methods for enhancing contrast from biological objects [l] have achieved a resolution not better than 1.5-2.0 nm. An exception to this generalization is the technique of labelling the biopolymer with individual heavy atoms [2]. This technique is capable of a resolution of about 0.5 nm but suffers from noise associated with the granularity of the supporting substrate and of structural irregularities within the "stain". The damage due to the direct interaction of the stain material with the biopolymer molecule and the radiation damage due to electron bombardment in the microscope are also serious practical problems which have not yet been overcome. A new specimen preparation technique for visualizing macromolecules by electron microscopy, known as epitaxial sandwiching, has been proposed by one of the authors [3]. It was suggested that the biopolymer molecule should be embedded in an epitaxially-grown thin . single crystal of gold (hereafter referred to as an "epitaxial sandwich"). Such an occluded molecule should give rise to contrast in the electron microscope. Since the lattice resolution in electron micrographs of crystalline material can be of the order of 0.2 run or better, it is conceivable that structural details in a bio255

polymer molecule close to this limit could be detectable. Thus, the resolution of the method would be limited only by the precision with which the gold crystal reflects the details of the molecular structure, while the random noise characterizing an amorphous substrate is expected to be reduced because of the crystallinity of gold film. Furthermore, the degradation of the molecule caused by electron irradiation should be inhibited in an epitaxial gold sandwich, both as a result of the high thermal conductivity of gold and due to the physical constraints imposed by the surrounding metal lattice. The details of the preparation of the epitaxial sandwhich have been previously reported [4]. In this contribution we will discuss some of the experimental results and report on computer simulation of contrast phenomena for a DNA molecule occluded in a singlecrystal gold film.

2. Contrast from a DNA molecule occluded in an epitaxial sandwich

A DNA molecule embedded in a crystalline metal foil is expected to behave as a crystal lattice defect. Therefore the contrast will be dependent on parameters characterizing the diffraction conditions for the crystal. Such parameters are as follows. (i) The orientation of the crystal matrix with respect to the beam and the corresponding value of the deviation parameters for the various operating reflections. (ii) The extinction distance for all the operating reflections. (iii) The total thickness of the foil.

(iv) The angular divergence of the incident beam. (v) The position of the molecule in the foil. In addition, the contrast will depend on the size qf the objective aperture and on the choice of image mode; that is, on which diffraction reflections contribute to form the final image. The contrast from an epitaxial sandwich of a biopolymer molecule in a crystalline matrix should be due to two main effects. (1) The presence of a low electron-density void in the sandwich whose shape is that of the molecule but whose presence does not otherwise affect the crystal structure. (2) A strain field in the vicinity of the molecule-crystal interface due to the displacement of metal atoms in the crystal lattice from their equilibrium lattice positions. Displacement of atoms in a direction perpendicular to the foil surface gives rise to a scalar product gR = 0, where g is a reciprocal lattice vector of the operating reflections. Therefore, according to classical contrast theory [S], such displacements cannot give rise to contrast. The matrix strain field caused by displacements parallel to the foil surface is not expected to be local in character and should give rise to a broad resultant image profile with correspondingly poor resolution. The best resolution should be provided by the voideffect arising from simple occlusion of the biopolymer in the single crystal matrix. In order to determine the strength of the contrast due to such a mechanism some calculations were performed. It was assumed that a cavity whose shape approximates that of a DNA molecule is extended in the direction parallel to the surface of the gold foil at a depth equal to one half of the total foil thickness. The calculations were restricted to the "in-focus" case and the intensity distribution was determined only at the bottom surface of the foil (that is, no attempt was made to include an image transfer function). The [OOl] -direction in the crystal film was chosen to be parallel to the, incoming beam and the following reflections were taken into account: go = 000, g1 4200,gz =02o,g3 =22o,g, =ioo,g, =oio,& = 220, g7 = 220, gs = 220. In order to calculate the wave intensities leaving the crystal the matrix methods of dynamic theory [6-71 were applied. Since the sample is very thin (lo-20 nm thick) absorption effects can be neglected.

The amplitudes of the transmitted and diffracted beam are found from the equation:

where q(Z) is the column vector whose components J/,,(Z) and $,(Z) (n = 1, . .. . 8) are the amplitudes of the transmitted and diffracted beams, respectively. The 1 column vector NO) = 0 represents the initial ampli0 tudes of incident beam at the entry surface (Z = 0). The matrix P is the scattering matrix, which is the product of three matrices:

P(Z)=MZ,)

where the scattering matrices i), (Z,) and P2(Z2) describe propagation of electrons through the perfect lattice with thicknesses Z, and Z2 above and below the molecule, respectively [7]. The matrix ir<Z,) describes the effect of the presence of the DNA molecule in a gold crystal. In our model the matrix i/<Z,) takes the form of the scattering matrix for a void

where the subscript "diag" refers to the "diagonal matrix", Sg, is the deviation parameter which represents the deviation of the reflecting sphere from the reciprocal lattice point g,, and Z3 is the local thickness of the void. The computer calculations were performed for the bright-field mode, that is the intensity of the direct transmitted beam 1, g I$,-,oOI2 was found. The results were printed on a two-dimensional display as "pseudomicrographs" and are presented in figs. 1 and 2. In fig. 1 computed images for various sandwich thicknesses and diffraction conditions are shown corresponding to the symmetrical case (optical axis parallel to [OOl]). In fig. 2 computed images are shown for the case where the thickness of the sandwich is constant, but the crystal orientation is varied (optical axis tilted away from [OOl]). It is clearly seen from fig. 1 that the contrast strongly depends on the exact value of the sandwich thickness, and the molecule exhibits the strongest contrast at certain critical crystal thicknesses (12 nm, for example, for the symmetrical case) the sign of the contrast can also be different for sandwiches with different thicknesses. On the other hand, the

contrast is alsoextremely sensitiveto the specimen tilting (seefig. 2) while the apparentmolecular width in the simulatedimagecan be lessthan the real width. The obvious conclusionis that it is indeed possible in principle to imagea biopolymer moleculewith high contrast by means epitaxial sandwichingand that of subunitsof structure, clearly visible in the simulated image,correspondto the narrowing and thickening of the molecularprofile. Sincethe dimensions such of structural detailsare not greater than 0.5 run, one may assume the resolution of the epitaxial sandthat wich could achieveat leastthis value.

detailsof the molecular structure. However, in an optical Fourier transform (fig. 4b) taken from a filament image(fig. 4a) two separate diffraction spotsareclearly distinguishable. (The scalein fig. 4b is marked in nm-`.) The distancebetween the spotscorresponds to an underlying imageperiodicity parallel to the axis of moleculewith a wavelengthof 3.2-3.6 nm. This result is in good agreementwith the X&y data [8] from which the pitch of the double helix structure is
3.4 nm.

The periodicity detected from the micrographin fig. 4a may be assumed correspondto the periodito city inherent in the molecular profile. Fig. 4c shows the optical diffraction pattern correspondingto a shadowprojection of the double helix modeI. Fig. 4c is consistentwith fig. 4b so that the periodicity of the contrast in fig. 4a is compatible with modulation of the imageprofile characteristic of the occludedDNA molecule. In an attempt to confirm this conclusion,computer . calculationsof the two dimensionalFourier transform of the imagein fig. 4a were performed. The method adopted for computer processing of the imagewassimilar to that usedby Smith et al. [9]. The electronmicrographs were digitized usingan Optronics Photoscan(P-1000) rotating drum densitoand meter. The phases amplitudesof the two-dimensionalFourier transform were calculated from the digitized imageusinga computer programsuppliedby Dr. R. Josephs (The WeizmannInstitute of Science, Rehovot). Fig. 5 represents computed diffraction the pattern for the DNA imagein fig. 4a. The boxes outline the diffraction maxima and the scaleis marked in A-`.
