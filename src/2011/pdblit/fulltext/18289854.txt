Biarylamine-based inhibitors of Met kinase have been identified. Lead compounds demonstrate nanomolar potency in Met kinase biochemical assays and significant activity in the Met-driven GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma cell line. X-ray crystallography revealed that these compounds adopt a bioactive conformation, in the kinase domain, consistent with that previously seen with 2-pyridone-based Met kinase inhibitors. Compound 9b demonstrated potent in vivo antitumor activity in the GTL-16 human tumor xenograft model. Ó 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Met (c-Met, HGFR-hepatocyte growth factor receptor) is a glycosylated, heterodimeric receptor tyrosine kinase, which is primarily expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells.1 The activation of Met is ligand dependent with the natural ligand being HGF/SF (hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor).2 The high-affinity binding of HGF/SF to Met results in receptor autophosphorylation and upregulation of Met kinase activity, which in turn activates a complex cell-signaling pathway that stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis. Met signaling is implicated in a wide variety of human malignancies, including: colon, lung, prostate, gastric, and breast cancers.3 This signaling contributes to oncogenesis and tumor progression in several human cancers and promotes aggressive cellular invasiveness that is strongly linked to tumor metastasis.4 The activation of Met-mediated oncogenic signaling can occur through aberrant paracrine or autocrine HGF stimulation and/or receptor overexpression. Other modes of activation for Met include: activating mutations, gene rearrangement and/or amplification, as well as the interaction of Met with other receptor families.4 We have previously disclosed potent Met kinase inhibitors, which have focused on the utilization of malonamide 1, acylurea 2, or pyridone 3 groups tethered to suitable kinase inhibitor templates (Fig. 1).5­7 These aminopyridine (AP) and pyrrolopyridine

(PP) templates have been shown, by X-ray crystal structure analysis, to serve as a replacement for the adenine group of ATP in establishing the critical hydrogen-bonding array to the hinge region of the Met protein. Kinetic analysis has further demonstrated that these compounds bind in the Met kinase domain in a manner that is ATP-competitive. The malonamide and acylurea groups of 1 and 2 approach planarity in the bioactive conformation, due to a hydrogen-bonding arrangement between the phenoxyaniline NH and the distal carbonyl group of either the malonamide or acylurea. Compound 3 appears to engage in a similar arrangement between the aniline NH and the carbonyl oxygen of the pyridone ring. Constraining this region of the molecule, as an aromatic ring, might serve to lock this portion of the molecule into a bioactive conformation. Molecular modeling studies suggested that a biarylamine motif could potentially be used to preorganize the molecule. To adopt the bioactive conformation, however, the aromatic rings would need to approach the coplanarity observed between the

fluorophenyl ring and attached acylurea group seen in compound 2 (Fig. 2). Further analysis suggested that utilization of a diphenylamine in this region, would force the rings out-of-plane by approximately 30°. Incorporation of an aromatic nitrogen ortho to the diarylamino nitrogen, was proposed to relieve this potential conformational energy strain. Herein, we describe the synthesis, structure­activity relationships, and in vivo activity of novel biarylamine-based Met kinase inhibitors. The synthesis of compounds in these series centered upon the acid-catalyzed addition of an appropriate 2-fluoro-4-aryloxyaniline to a desired 2-halonicotinamide (Scheme 1). Thus, 2-chloro- or 2-fluoronicotinamide 5 could be readily generated from the precursor nicotinic acid via generation of the acid chloride and coupling that acid chloride with a suitable amine. Addition of the resultant halonicotinamide to 4-(4-amino-2-fluorophenoxy)picolinamide 6,8 in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate,9

followed by treatment with bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene and pyridine afforded compound 8.10 Pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine analog 9 was prepared in a similar manner. Thus, microwave-assisted reaction between 4-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-4-yloxy)-3-fluorobenzenamine7 and the desired 2-chloro- or 2-fluoro-nicotinamide, in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, afforded compound 9, albeit in low (18­27%) yield. A subsequent optimization study on the synthesis of the pyrrolopyridine analogs determined preferred conditions, utilizing 4 N HCl in dioxane and the desired 2-fluoronicotinamide, under thermal conditions, which afforded compound 9b in 72% yield.11a Initial structure­activity relationship (SAR) studies centered on determining the effect of substitution on the nicotinamide nitrogen, with both the aminopyridine (AP) and pyrrolopyridine (PP) based scaffolds (Table 1). Two assays were employed to evaluate the activity of the compounds. A Met kinase substrate based assay was used to assess the ability of these compounds to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the Met receptor.6 Compounds exhibiting sufficient activity were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of the GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma cell line, which expresses high levels of constitutively-activated Met kinase.6 Studies have shown this cell line to be very sensitive to small molecule inhibitors of Met.12 As such, it was utilized as the primary in vitro cell line for the screening of Met inhibitors. In the Met kinase assay, utilization of the aminopyridine core with an initial p-chlorophenyl amide (8a) resulted in a compound demonstrating potent activity. Incorporating a 2,4-dihalogenated amine, in the form of the 2,4-difluorophenylamide (8b), afforded

similar activity in both assays. With a change to the pyrrolopyridine core (9b), potency in the Met kinase assay was maintained, while a greater than fourfold improvement in activity in the GTL16 cellular proliferation assay was observed. Monosubstitution in the 2-position of the aniline (9c and 9d) afforded compounds that, while still potent in the Met kinase assay, exhibited somewhat decreased cellular activity, compared to 9b. Methylation of the nicotinamide nitrogen (9e) resulted in compounds with significantly reduced activity in both assays. As expected, smaller substitutions on the nicotinamide nitrogen, such as the primary carboxamide or the N-methyl nicotinamide, also resulted in compounds with reduced activity in the Met kinase assay (data not shown). Heteroaromatic replacement of the phenyl ring, in the form of N-pyridin2-yl-nicotinamide 9f, afforded potent cellular activity. Extension of the terminal phenyl via N-benzyl-nicotinamide (9g) and incorporation of polar substituents, such as hydroxyethyl (9h) also resulted in compounds exhibiting potency against Met kinase as well as cellular activity. For the purpose of exploring the SAR about the central heterocycle, the terminal 2,4-diflourophenyl group was held constant while varying the central heterocycle (Table 2). The synthesis of

various biarylamine targets, wherein the heterocycle was defined as a pyridine ring, were generally carried out similarly to the route previously described in Scheme 1.8 In the case of the pyrimidine analogs a slightly different route was employed (Scheme 2).8 Ethyl 4-chloro-2-(methylthio)pyrimidine-5-carboxylate was treated with 4-(4-amino-2-fluorophenoxy)-picolinamide, under acidic conditions, to give ethyl 4-(4-(2-carbamoylpyridin-4-yloxy)3-fluoro-phenylamino)-2-(methylthio)-pyrimidine-5-carboxylate. Saponification with NaOH, afforded the carboxylate salt which was then coupled with 2,4-difluoroaniline to give intermediate 11. Treat-

ment with bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene afforded the 2(methylthio)pyrimidine product 12.11b Alternatively, intermediate 11 was oxidized with m-CPBA to afford sulfone 13, which was then displaced by a variety of nucleophiles, including dimethylamine. Subsequent treatment with bis(trifluorocetoxy)iodobenzene afforded compound 14. The SAR about the heterocyclic portion of the biarylamines is shown in Table 2. Compounds which incorporated a nitrogen in the heterocycle, ortho to the amine juncture, showed preferred activity in the Met kinase assay. Consistent with the activity observed for the 2-aminonicotinamides 8b and 9b, compounds substituted in the 5- or 6-position (15­17) also exhibited potency against Met kinase regardless of the core being utilized. The 4-aminonicotinamides, 18 and 19, were less potent in the kinase assay, presumably due to the necessity of that pyridine ring to lie out-of-plane with the fluorophenylamino ring. Replacement of the pyridine ring of the nicotinamide with pyrazine (20 and 21), led to an eightfold drop in kinase activity, relative to 8b and 9b. A decrease in the cellular activity was also observed. Kinase and cellular activities observed with pyrimidine substitution (22, 12, and 14) were found to be sensitive to the type of group located in the 2-position of the pyrimidine. Attempts to improve the solubility of these compounds, by incorporating a 2-position substituent having a basic nitrogen, resulted in a decrease in activity. The X-ray crystal structure of 8b13 revealed the compound resides in the Met kinase domain (Fig. 3) with a conformation consistent with that of pyridone 3.7 Of particular note is how the biarylamine rings adopt a conformation in which they approach planarity mimicking the hydrogen-bond between the amide NH and the 2-pyridone carbonyl oxygen in 3. Based on its potency against Met kinase,14 as well as its activity in the GTL-16 cellular proliferation assay, 9b was evaluated in a preliminary pharmacokinetic study in mice. The compound demonstrated reasonable exposures in an 8 h mouse oral exposure study at 50 mpk (Cmax = 9.3 lM, AUC0­8 h = 42 lM h) and was subsequently taken into the GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma model.5 In the study, anthymic mice are implanted with GTL-16 xenografts. The compound was administered orally at various dose levels, once

daily over 15 days. Figure 4 illustrates the dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition of compound 9b in the GTL-16 gastric carcinoma model. The compound demonstrated activity at multiple dose levels, resulting in complete tumor stasis at the lowest dose tested (25 mg/kg). In summary, biarylamine-based inhibitors of Met kinase were identified. This template was found to serve as an effective surrogate for the hydrogen-bonded array previously observed in acylureas, malonamides, and pyridones. When suitably tethered to an aminopyridine or pyrrolopyridine, these compounds demonstrated potent activity in the kinase and cellular proliferation assays. Based on the X-ray crystal structure, compound 8b was shown to adopt a conformation consistent with that previously seen for compound 3, in the Met kinase binding domain. Additionally, in vivo studies involving compound 9b demonstrated that these compounds can exhibit potent antitumor activity.
