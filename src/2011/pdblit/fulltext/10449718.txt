ABSTRACT Anthranilate synthase catalyzes the synthesis of anthranilate from chorismate and glutamine and is feedback-inhibited by tryptophan. The enzyme of the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus has been crystallized in the absence of physiological ligands, and its three-dimensional structure has been determined at 2.5-Å resolution with x-ray crystallography. It is a heterotetramer of anthranilate synthase (TrpE) and glutamine amidotransferase (TrpG) subunits, in which two TrpG:TrpE protomers associate mainly via the TrpG subunits. The small TrpG subunit (195 residues) has the known ``triad'' glutamine amidotransferase fold. The large TrpE subunit (421 residues) has a novel fold. It displays a cleft between two domains, the tips of which contact the TrpG subunit across its active site. Clusters of catalytically essential residues are located inside the cleft, spatially separated from clustered residues involved in feedback inhibition. The structure suggests a model in which chorismate binding triggers a relative movement of the two domain tips of the TrpE subunit, activating the TrpG subunit and creating a channel for passage of ammonia toward the active site of the TrpE subunit. Tryptophan presumably blocks this rearrangement, thus stabilizing the inactive states of both subunits. The structure of the TrpE subunit is a likely prototype for the related enzymes 4-amino 4-deoxychorismate synthase and isochorismate synthase. Anthranilate synthase (AnthS) from bacteria and yeast is a multifunctional enzyme composed of small TrpG and large TrpE subunits or domains (1). TrpG belongs to the family of ``triad'' glutamine amidotransferases (2, 3), which hydrolyze glutamine and transfer nascent ammonia through an intramolecular channel to a synthase active site. The TrpE subunit is a bifunctional enzyme (4). It catalyzes the synthesis of anthranilate in two steps (Scheme 1): the

is not released into the solvent. The TrpG2:TrpE2 complex mediates communication between three distinct ligandbinding sites on the two subunits (1): (i) chorismate binding to the TrpE subunit activates the release of ammonia from glutamine bound to the TrpG subunit; (ii) nascent ammonia is transferred intramolecularly from the TrpG to the TrpE subunit, in preference to ammonia from the bulk solvent (1), and (iii) tryptophan binding to a distinct site on the TrpE subunit (5) inhibits all partial reactions of the TrpG2:TrpE2 complex. The strictly ordered addition of chorismate before glutamine (6) and the cooperative binding of both chorismate and tryptophan (7) to the complex suggest that conformational changes mediate the communication between the various ligand-binding sites. Here, we report the crystal structure of the unliganded AnthS complex from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus. The TrpE subunit has a novel fold with distinct binding sites inferred for chorismate and tryptophan. The active sites of the TrpG and TrpE subunits face each other across the intersubunit interface but do not form a channel in the apoenzyme.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Enzyme Production and Properties. The tandem trpEG genes of S. solfataricus (8) were cloned from chromosomal DNA into the NdeI and BamHI sites of expression vector pET15b (Novagen), which attaches a hexahistidine tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPR 2 GSHM1..TrpE) to the N terminus of TrpE subunit and were expressed overnight at 37°C in LB medium in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). AnthS was detectable only in the soluble fraction of cell homogenates (buffer: 0.05 M K2HPO4, pH 7.5) and was purified in four sequential steps as follows: (i) heat treatment in the presence of 0.05 M glutamine (9) at 60°C for 25 min; (ii) Ni2 -metal chelate chromatography (gradient, 0.02­0.5 M imidazole in buffer); (iii) removal of the hexahistidine tag by trypsin digestion (new N terminus, Gly-3 Ser-2 His-1 Met1. . . ); and (iv) hydroxylapatite chromatography (gradient, 0.025­0.5 M buffer, containing 0.1 M KCl). The enzyme was 90% pure with a yield of 0.1 mg of protein per liter of culture. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements (Mr 153 kDa, data not shown) confirmed the calculated Mr [2 (21.9 47.7) 139.3 kDa], proving that the enzyme is a TrpG2:TrpE2 heterotetramer. The enzyme kinetic constants were determined fluorimetrically at 60°C in 0.05 M Tris HCl (adjusted to pH 7.5 at 60°C), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, as described by

The data from the HgCl2-I and (CH3)3PbOAc derivatives were scaled to the Native-I data with SCALEIT (13). Heavy atom positions were determined by difference Patterson and difference Fourier analysis. Final refinement of the heavy atom parameters and phase calculation, including anomalous scattering of the heavy atoms, was performed with SHARP (14). Phases were improved by 120 cycles of solvent flattening with SOLOMON (15). The resulting map was interpretable in most regions of the structure. It was used for model building in combination with a map calculated with phases derived from the isomorphous and anomalous scattering contribution of the mercury derivative (HgCl2-II) at four different wavelengths (see below). Multipleisomorphous replacement-phasing statistics are summarized in Table 1. Multiple-Wavelength Anomalous Dispersion. SCALA and SCALEIT (13) were used to scale Native-II and HgCl2-II data at wavelengths 1, 2, and 3 to HgCl2-II data at wavelength 4, which was treated as reference data set. Heavy atom parameters as determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (see above) were used as starting model for refinement with SHARP (14). Phases were improved by 120 cycles of solvent flattening with SOLOMON (15). The resulting electron density map was of good quality and was used to trace about 90% of the structure by using O (16). Multiple-wavelength anomalous-dispersion phasing statistics are summarized in Table 1. Refinement. All data between 30 Å and 2.7 Å of the Native-II data set (reprocessed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK; ref 17; see Table 1) were used to refine the model coordinates with X-PLOR (18). Partial structure factors from a flat bulk-solvent model were applied throughout the refinement (19). After the R factor had converged at 0.234 (free R factor, 5% of data, 0.269; ref. 20), Native-II data were subjected to an overall anisotropic B factor scaling (18). The protein coordinates were subsequently refined against the rescaled Native-II data set. The R factor of the final model is 0.225 (free R factor 0.253) for all data in the resolution range 30­2.5 Å. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. The structure is well defined in most regions of the polypeptide chains. The electron density is weak for residues 133­140, 247­249, and 301­303, and no interpretable electron density is

The structure of AnthS was solved by using multiple isomorphous replacement and multiple-wavelength anomalous-dispersion phasing techniques.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structure and Active Site of the TrpG Subunit. The TrpG subunit has 195 residues (Fig. 1A) and a compact, spherical shape (Fig. 3). The core of the / structure of the TrpG subunit is an open, seven-stranded, mixed -sheet (Fig. 3 A and C). The fold is similar to both the N-terminal domain of GMP synthetase (25% sequence identity; ref. 3) and the C-terminal domain of the small subunit of carbamoyl phosphate synthase (23% sequence identity; ref. 24). Structural superposition revealed rms deviations of structurally equivalent C atoms of 1.31 Å and 1.52 Å, respectively. The residues of the catalytic triad Cys-84, His-175, and Glu-177 are at identical positions, with Cys-84 adopting a similarly unfavorable backbone con60°, 110°) as in the two precedents formation ( above, ready for catalysis of the glutaminase reaction. Structure of the TrpE Subunit. The TrpE subunit of AnthS (421 residues; Fig. 1B) has a complicated / folding pattern of novel topology (Figs. 2 and 3) with two domains and a cleft. Domain I is composed of residues 1­49, 116­224, and 376­421 and consists of an 11-stranded, antiparallel -sheet and four helices. Two long inserts, namely subdomain IIA (residues 50­115) between strands 3 and 7 and subdomain IIB (residues 225­375) between strands 12 and 20, together form domain II. It consists of a nine-stranded antiparallel -sheet and six helices. All crossover connections of both

domains are right-handed and helical. The -sheets of both domains have a left-handed twist of 90° (Fig. 3). The strands 3, 2, 11, and 12 of domain I together with strands 6, 5, 18, and 19 of domain II form an orthogonal -sandwich with an hydrophobic interface. The amino acid sequence of the TrpE subunit (8) is 99 residues shorter than that of Salmonella typhimurium (1). From the alignment of the two sequences there are five major deletions inferred in the S. solfataricus sequence. All are located on the surface of the TrpE subunit (Figs. 1B and 3). Four of the five deletions occur within the first 140 residues, and two of the affected regions (residues 133­140 and 247­ 249) display weak electron density. These findings are consistent with the observation that thermostable proteins often display shorter surface loops than their thermolabile homologues (25). Catalytic and Regulatory Sites of the TrpE Subunit. Mutation of the trpE gene of S. typhimurium has identified six conserved residues (see Fig. 1B) that are important for catalysis (4, 10). The C positions of the corresponding residues in the TrpE subunit of S. solfataricus (Thr-243, Asp-266, His-306, Thr-333, Gly-393, and Glu-403) are located on two internal surfaces of the cleft (Fig. 3B). Similar mutational studies of AnthS from both S. typhimurium (5) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (26) have established that residues corresponding to Glu-30, Ser-31, Ile-32, Ser-42, Val-43, Asn-204, Pro-205, Met209, Phe-210, Gly-221, and Ala-373 of S. solfataricus TrpE

(Fig. 1B) are involved in feedback inhibition of AnthS by tryptophan. All but Ile-32, Val-43, and Ala-373 are invariant or conserved. All feedback-sensitive residues except Ala-373 are found in domain I of the TrpE subunit and are clustered on one side of the orthogonal -sandwich (Fig. 3B). The mean distance between the residues involved in catalysis and feedback regulation (20 Å) confirms earlier evidence (7, 10) that tryptophan and chorismate bind to separate sites. However, the complicated fold of the TrpE subunit (Figs. 2 and 3) rules out the proposal of distinct N-terminal regulatory and Cterminal catalytic domains of the TrpE subunit (5, 7). Structure of the TrpG2:TrpE2 Heterotetramer. Both domains of the TrpE subunit contact the TrpG subunit, close to its active site triad (Figs. 3 A and 4). The extensive interface buries 2,730 Å2 of surface area and includes 17 invariant or conserved contact residues of 27 in both subunits (Fig. 1). The view of the TrpG:TrpE interface, depicted parallel to helix 7 of the TrpE subunit in Fig. 4A, shows that domain II of TrpE uses helix 7, loop 3 6 and the N terminus of helix 9 as docking surfaces, whereas domain I uses the C-terminus of 4, loop 4 10, and loop 21 10. The view of the TrpG:TrpE interface down the axis of helix 7 of the TrpE subunit (Fig. 4B) shows that the cleft between the two domains of the TrpE subunit is open sideways to solvent. The six catalytically important residues as well as some of the feedback-sensitive residues (Fig. 4B shows Asn-204) of the TrpE subunit are exposed. In contrast, the active site of the TrpG subunit is

shielded from solvent. The distance between the groups of catalytic residues in the TrpG and TrpE subunits is about 15 Å. The two TrpG:TrpE heterodimers are related by a crystallographic twofold rotation axis and are connected via their TrpG subunits (Fig. 3C). The TrpG:TrpG interface buries 1,720 Å2 of surface area, suggesting that this interaction corresponds to the tetramerization interface (27). It is predominantly hydrophobic, with seven, albeit nonconserved, side chains contributed by each subunit (Met-1, Leu-3, Tyr-27, Ile-29, Ile-31, Ile-36, and Ile-44). Moreover, the side chains of Glu-35 and Arg-43 (a prime denotes residues of the symmetry-related subunit) are salt-bridged, and the peptide units of Glu-35 and Ser-37 are hydrogen-bonded. An additional lattice contact related to a crystallographic twofold rotation axis is observed between TrpE subunits. It involves residues from 9, 10, and the C terminus of 10 (compare Fig. 3 A and C). Because this crystal contact is more polar than the TrpG:TrpG interface, involves two water molecules, and buries only 1,010 Å2 of surface area, it is a less likely tetramerization interface. The observed noncooperative binding of either chorismate or tryptophan in the S. solfataricus AnthS (9) is consistent with the lack of contact between the TrpE subunits in the het-

erotetramer (Fig. 3C). Anthranilate synthases that have additional sequence inserts or additional functional domains and display cooperative ligand binding (e.g., AnthS from S. typhimurium; refs. 1 and 4) may have significantly different quaternary structures. Functional Implications. Catalysis. Combining the information from the crystal structure of AnthS from S. solfataricus with reported kinetic and mutational properties of the enzymes from bacteria and yeast leads to new, albeit indirect, insights into the allosteric interactions between the distinct catalytic and regulatory sites of this trifunctional enzyme complex. Of the six catalytic residues identified by mutagenic analysis, three (Thr-243, Asp-266, and His-306) are clustered in subdomain IIB that constitutes the ceiling of the active site cleft (compare Figs. 3B and 4B), whereas the remaining three (Thr-333, Gly-393, and Glu-403) are clustered on the floor of the cleft. The C atoms of the two groups of residues are separated by 12­18Å. If these residues were required to be in close proximity for chorismate binding, the cleft would have to narrow, possibly by movement of subdomain IIB (see Fig. 3B). In one scenario, bound chorismate would be tightly sand-

wiched between the identified residues. After conversion of chorismate to ADIC (Scheme 1), the product would remain bound to the original chorismate site, ready for the subsequent ADIC lyase reaction. However, chorismate is a mixed competitive inhibitor of ADIC lyase (4), indicating that chorismate and ADIC can bind simultaneously to the active site, perhaps at close but spatially distinct positions in the cleft of the TrpE subunit. In support of this alternative scenario, mutant enzymes with replacements at any one of the two ceiling residues of the active-site cleft (Asp-266 and His-306) catalyze the synthesis of ADIC from chorismate (Scheme 1) at substantial rates but have negligible ADIC lyase activity (4, 28). However, mutant enzymes with changes at any one of the three floor residues have drastically reduced ADIC synthase and ADIC lyase activities (28). Nevertheless, in both scenarios, anthranilate, a planar molecule that lacks the enolpyruvyl moiety of both chorismate and ADIC, presumably interacts only weakly with the substrate-binding residues. Allosteric interactions. The closed active site of the TrpG does not allow glutamine to enter (Fig. 4). Moreover, kinetic studies (6) indicate that chorismate must bind first before glutamine can be bound. Because both TrpE domains interact with distinct surface components of the TrpG subunit, close to its active site (Figs. 3 A and 4A), conformational changes accompanying chorismate binding could force the TrpG subunit to switch from a nonfunctional to a functional conformation, allowing glutamine to enter and be hydrolyzed at the active site of the TrpG subunit and creating a channel for transferring nascent ammonia to the TrpE subunit. Movement of subdomain IIB may mediate communication between the sites of the TrpE and TrpG subunits. In a similar way, movement of an N-terminal domain of the -subunit of tryptophan synthase mediates communication between the catalytic sites of the - and -subunits (29). Inhibition of AnthS of both S. typhimurium (5­7) and S. solfataricus (9) by tryptophan is competitive with respect to chorismate. The distance between the putative binding sites for chorismate and tryptophan (Fig. 3B) suggests that the competition is due to conformational changes that mediate mutually exclusive binding of these ligands. That is, tryptophan binding stabilizes a protein conformation to which chorismate has little or no affinity, and vice versa. A simple means for tryptophan to regulate chorismate binding and the activity of the TrpG subunit would be to prevent the putative structural rearrangements that accompany the binding of chorismate. Because diffusion of tryptophan into crystals of AnthS does not crack them, it is likely that the unliganded form of the TrpG2:TrpE2 complex, as seen in the crystal structure, has high affinity for tryptophan and low affinity for chorismate. The Structure of the TrpE Subunit as a Prototype. 4-Amino 4-deoxychorismate synthase (PabB) and isochorismate synthase (EntC) catalyze the conversion of chorismate to closely related analogues of ADIC (Scheme 1; refs. 30 and 31). Moreover, sequence alignments of these proteins with TrpE (32, 33) reveal significant similarities amongst the C-terminal 250 residues (AnthS from S. solfataricus/PabB from S. typhimurium: 40% identical, 53% similar residues; AnthS/EntC from S. typhimurium: 32% identical, 40% similar residues). This most conserved portion of the TrpE sequence is also devoid of insertions and deletions in various TrpE sequences, with one exception (Fig. 1B). Because the catalytic processes and the sequences of the three enzymes are related, the fold of the TrpE subunit is a likely prototype for this group of chorismate-metabolizing enzymes.
