Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are, after cytochromes P450, the most important monooxygenase system in humans and are involved in xenobiotics metabolism and variability in drug response. The x-ray structure of a soluble prokaryotic FMO from Methylophaga sp. strain SK1 has been solved at 2.6-Å resolution and is now the protein of known structure with the highest sequence similarity to human FMOs. The structure possesses a two-domain architecture, with both FAD and NADP well defined by the electron density maps. Biochemical analysis shows that the prokaryotic enzyme shares many functional properties with mammalian FMOs, including substrate specificity and the ability to stabilize the hydroperoxyflavin intermediate that is crucial in substrate oxygenation. On the basis of their location in the structure, the nicotinamide ring and the adjacent ribose of NADP turn out to be an integral part of the catalytic site being actively engaged in the stabilization of the oxygenating intermediate. This feature suggests that NADP(H) has a moonlighting role, in that it adopts two binding modes that allow it to function in both flavin reduction and oxygen reactivity modulation, respectively. We hypothesize that a relative domain rotation is needed to bring NADP(H) to these distinct positions inside the active site. Localization of mutations in human FMO3 that are known to cause trimethylaminuria (fish-odor syndrome) in the elucidated FMO structure provides a structural explanation for their biological effects.

wo effective families of enzyme systems have evolved in eukaryotes to oxygenate xenobiotics: cytochromes P450 and flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs). They both help organisms to deal with potentially toxic exogenous compounds from natural sources and, most notably in humans, represent the enzyme systems involved in the metabolism of drugs and pollutants (1). FMOs belong to the flavoenzyme class of singlecomponent flavoprotein monooxygenases (2); they use equivalents from NADPH to reduce the FAD cofactor, which, in turn, becomes capable of reacting with molecular oxygen to yield the C4a-hydroperoxyFAD intermediate (Fig. 1A). This intermediate is responsible of the insertion of one oxygen atom into a substrate, with the production of the second intermediate C4ahydroxyFAD. The loss of the second oxygen atom from the flavin in the form of a molecule of water restores the oxidized cofactor (3). The first FMO isolated from pig liver was described as liver microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase (4) and thoroughly characterized in its kinetic properties (5­8). FMOs act on a variety of nonpolar substrates that contain soft nucleophile heteroatoms (9). The most remarkable feature of their catalytic cycle is their ability to stabilize the crucial C4ahydroperoxyFAD intermediate until a substrate gains access to the active site (10). A prominent aspect is that the presence of NADP is essential for intermediate stabilization and, consistently, NADP remains bound to the enzyme throughout the catalytic cycle, being the last product to be released (Fig. 1 A) (6). The human FMO (hFMO) gene family comprises five genes and some pseudogenes. Of the five functional isoforms, hFMO3

is the one most abundantly expressed in adult liver and largely involved in drug metabolism (11, 12). All isoforms display 60% sequence identity, a moderate level of polymorphism (13­15), and the presence of tissue- and age-specific splice variants (16). Several mutations in hFMO3 have been reported to cause the inheritable disease known as trimethylaminuria (TMAU) or ``fish-odor syndrome,'' because of accumulation of substrate trimethylamine in body fluids (17). All mammalian FMOs have a strong membrane association and poor water solubility (9), and no structure of a mammalian FMO is currently available. In recent years, several plant (18) and prokaryotic enzymes have been annotated as FMOs. The first discovered bacterial FMO was identified in the methylotrophic bacterium Methylophaga sp. strain SK1 (mFMO) for the purpose of biocatalytic production of the blue dye indigo (19). mFMO is not membraneassociated. Its sequence (456 aa) scores 31% identity with hFMO3 and contains two dinucleotide-binding signatures (Rossmann folds) for FAD and NADP and the FMO-identifying motif FXGXXXHXXX(Y/F) (20). mFMO shares 27% sequence identity with Schizosaccharomyces pombe FMO, whose crystal structure has been recently reported (21). The sequences of Methylophaga, human, and S. pombe FMOs are aligned (22, 23) in Fig. 1B. Here, we present the biochemical characterization of mFMO with kinetic data on a number of substrates and the 2.6-Å resolution structure obtained by x-ray crystallography. In addition to the interest raised by the homology with the hFMOs, the crystal structure of the bacterial enzyme highlights the direct involvement of NADP in the stabilization of the crucial C4a-hydroperoxyFAD intermediate, a unique feature of these enzymes.

Fig. 2. Absorbance spectra of mFMO. Trace A represents the fully oxidized form in the absence of NADP . Trace B was obtained as described in Materials and Methods by the addition of an equimolar amount of NADPH under aerobic conditions and is consistent with formation of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. The presence of a small amount of oxidized enzyme because of the intrinsic NADPH-oxidase activity accounts for the shoulder observed at 450 nm. Traces C to G were sequentially recorded after 25 sec, 90 sec, 3 min, 10 min, and 18 min and show the slow decay of the C4ahydroperoxyflavin intermediate, which is completed after 30 min.

Fig. 1. Biochemical properties of FMOs. (A) Scheme of the catalytic cycle. NADP that forms upon reduction of the flavin cofactor stays bound throughout the reaction and is essential for stabilization of C4a-hydroperoxyFAD (Bottom Right) (3­ 6). Enzyme-bound NADP prevents FMO from working as an NADPH oxidase, which would produce H2O2 (dashed line). S and S-O indicate substrate and monooxygenated product, respectively. (B) Alignment of the sequences of Methylophaga FMO (MeFMO), Homo sapiens FMO3 isoform 1 (hFMO3), and S. pombe FMO (SpFMO). Sequence identities to hFMO3 are 31% for mFMO and 27% for S. pombe FMO.

of an organic substrate, mFMO shows a slight NADPH oxidase 13 M, kcat 0.06 s 1 measured in activity (Km,NADPH steady-state conditions) producing hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1 A). The ability to stabilize the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate, well documented in the early works on pig FMO (4, 6, 7), can also be demonstrated in mFMO. Mixing the enzyme with an equimolar amount of aerated NADPH (in the absence of an organic substrate) leads to the immediate formation of a C4ahydroperoxyflavin intermediate characterized by the typical absorbance spectrum with a peak at 360 nm (refs. 6, 25­27; Fig. 2, trace B). Over 30 min, the spectrum slowly reacquires the characteristic 442-nm peak of the oxidized flavin (Fig. 2, traces C to G). Conversely, addition of excess substrate immediately brings the spectrum back to that of the fully oxidized flavin. Steady-state kinetic assays performed at a fixed concentration of NADPH with typical FMO substrates showed Michaelis­ Menten behavior (Table 1). Substrates were selected on the basis of the following considerations: trimethylamine is a common endogenous substrate for hFMO3; methimazole and (S)-(-)nicotine are of pharmacological relevance (9); methimazole and N,N-dimethylaniline has been extensively exploited to test mammalian FMO activity in literature; indole is the putative substrate of mFMO in the pathway for the production of indigo (19). All these compounds are good substrates, with trimethylamine exhibiting the highest catalytic efficiency (Table 1). An enzymatic activity has also been unexpectedly appreciated on dimethyl sulfoxide initially used for dissolving some substrates, confirming that mFMO accepts a broad range of N- and S-containing molecules largely overlapping with the substrates of

the first Rossmann fold for FAD binding, the fingerprint sequence for FMOs (20), and the second Rossmann fold for NADP binding, respectively. The green asterisks mark residues that are part of the active site, whereas the red asterisks indicate residues that are mutated in patients affected by TMAU. The alignment was performed with ClustalW2 (22) and ESPript (23).

mammalian FMOs. Moreover, as observed in steady-state kinetics of mammalian enzymes (4), NADP was competitive (Ki of 30 M) with NADPH. Taken together, these observations suggest that, similar to the mammalian FMOs, the bacterial enzyme behaves like a ``cocked gun,'' spending most of the time in the form of the hydroperoxyflavin intermediate. Any heteroatom-containing compound gaining access to the stabilized intermediate is monooxygenated, in accordance with the striking substrate promiscuity of FMOs.
Overall Three-Dimensional Structure. Wild-type mFMO crystallized readily, but all crystals invariably suffered from severe twinning. This problem was addressed by exploiting a number of techniques, among which surface mutagenesis proved to be successful (28). We targeted sets of two/three consecutive charged residues (mainly Glu and Lys) supposed to be solventexposed based on alignment with homologous proteins [supporting information (SI) Table S1]. The mutant E158A/E159A gave crystals that turned out to be free from twinning (the mutant has biochemical properties virtually identical to those of wild type; Table 1). Addition of NADP was essential for crystal growth. mFMO structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method at 2.6-Å resolution (Tables 2 and 3) (29, 30). Protein molecules are arranged to give two identical homodimers (Fig. 3) in the asymmetric unit, which is consistent with the dimeric form determined by size-exclusion chromatography for both wild-type and E158A/E159A mFMOs. However, each of the active sites is exclusively built up by residues belonging to a single subunit. rmsd between equivalent C atoms of the monomers are 0.1 Å. The protein is made up of two distinct domains (Fig. 3A), a larger FAD-binding domain (residues 1­169 and 281­461) and a smaller NADP-binding domain (residues 170­280). Both domains display a typical dinucleotide-binding fold and are connected through a double linker (around residues 170 and Table 2. Data collection statistics

There are three long stretches interposed between the two domains; they lack secondary structure elements (residues 44­80, 166­186, 276­ 306), suggesting the absence of any rigid block opposing the reciprocal movement of the domains.

a cleft leading to the NADP molecule at the interface between the two protein domains (Fig. 4A). NADP occupies the cleft, blocking the access to the flavin and the catalytic core. The nicotinamide ring is sandwiched between the re side of the flavin and the single -helix of the NADP-binding domain and is roughly coplanar with isoalloxazine at a distance of 3.0­4.0 Å. Importantly, the nicotinamide orients its reactive C4 away from the flavin N5 (C4-N5 distance of 5.1 Å) so that the NADP amide group is within hydrogen-bond distances from the flavin O4 and N5. These potential hydrogenbond interactions led us to tentatively assign the orientation of the NADP carboxamide group as shown in Fig. 4B. Spanning in proximity of the flavin ring, a 161-Å3 cavity was detected by the program VOIDOO (31) by using a 1.4-Å radius sphere as probe (Fig. 4C). Its limits are defined by the isoalloxazine, the NADP ribose and several protein residues (Asn-78, Gly-79, Pro-80, Cys-83, Leu-84, Phe-402, Trp-405, Gln-323, Trp-324, Tyr-325, Ser-326, Tyr-212). The role of Tyr-212 is remarkable, because its side chain together with the ribose of NADP shields the cavity from the outside, forming the only barrier to the solvent (Fig. 4). After obtaining the native dataset at 2.6-Å resolution, several attempts were made to bind substrate molecules inside the crystals by either soaking or cocrystallization but none of them were successful. Nevertheless, in the electron density map calculated from soaked crystals (we refer to the experiment with N,N-dimethylaniline hereafter named ``dataset from soaking;'' Tables 2 and 3), a well defined ellipsoidal peak of density was found in proximity to the catalytic site inside the above-described cavity, halfway between Tyr-212 and the pyrimidine ring of the flavin (Fig. 4C). Alternative refinements with several candidate molecules and atoms only yielded reasonable B-factors when dioxygen or monoatomic ions of comparable electron density were fitted inside. Based on these observations, we assigned the orphan electron densities to dioxygen, which is included in the coordinate file deposited in the Protein Data Bank (32). However, we do not rule out that, instead of molecular oxygen, a superoxide molecule, possibly generated upon the x-ray exposure of the crystal, is bound at this position. Likewise, the presence of a monoatomic ion (especially if positively charged,

mFMO structure fall in solvent-exposed areas far apart from the active site (Fig. 3A). Discussion We investigated mFMO for its ability to work as a good model for the study of human enzymes. Biochemical analysis revealed that this prokaryotic enzyme shares many functional properties with mammalian FMOs, including the ability to stabilize C4ahydroperoxyFAD for minutes. The well known role of NADPH coenzyme in the catalytic cycle of FMOs is that of providing FAD with reducing equivalents (Fig. 1 A). The chemistry of NADPH requires that reduction of the flavin cofactor is brought about through a hydride transfer from the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring to the flavin N5 atom (Fig. 4B). The stereochemistry observed in mFMO structure does not reveal a close proximity between these two crucial atoms and thus is clearly not compatible with a hydride transfer. This implies that the structure in the crystals does not correspond to the conformation in which NADPH is able to reduce the flavin. A modeling experiment (Fig. 5A) in which the hypothetical coordinates of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin are superimposed onto the flavin coordinates of the mFMO structure places the two additional oxygen atoms of the C4a-adduct within hydrogen-bond distance from O2 atom of NADP ribose, which then would be perfectly positioned to properly stabilize this oxygenating intermediate. The positioning of the two additional oxygens would require only a small (1­2 Å) shift of the Asn-78 side chain, which in turn could contribute to their stabilization through polar interactions. Consistently, the homologous Asn-61 of hFMO3 is essential for activity (refs. 11 and 17; Fig. 3A). These considerations suggest that the conformation in mFMO crystals is likely to correspond to that promoting the stabilization of C4a-hydroperoxyFAD. This feature is known to depend on the presence of NADP that was proposed to act as a ``gate keeper,'' preventing the decay of the intermediate possibly by protecting the flavin N5 from solvent attack (6). Our structure helps to explain these functional properties and is a clear observation of a second fascinating functional property of NADP in FMO catalytic cycle, i.e., the stabilization of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin. NADP shields the active site and provides a proper H-bonding environment that can prolong the intermediate half-life. Therefore, NADP is an integral part of the enzyme catalytic machinery that promotes intermediate stabilization and substrate monooxygenation. The approach of a substrate to the intermediate may be promoted by a displacement of both the loop of Tyr-212 (NADP-binding domain) and the stretch of residues 407­415 at the end of a -helix (FAD-binding domain, Fig. 3A), as suggested by the higher B-factors of this protein region. The crystal structure of mFMO is similar to that of S. pombe FMO (21). In particular, most of the catalytic residues are identical in the two enzymes (Fig. 1B), which display similar active sites and, most importantly, essentially the same conformation of bound NADP (Fig. 5B). In their original article, Eswaramoorthy et al. (21) explained the observed NADP binding mode as indicative of a flavin-reduction mechanism involving hydride transfer from the nicotinamide C2 atom (rather than C4) to the flavin. This interpretation has been subsequently revised as not compatible with known NADP(H) chemistry without any further comment (33). We believe that, in view of their structural similarity, Methylophaga and S. pombe FMOs are very likely to have a similar catalytic mechanism with NADP being actively involved in the stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate as described above. In this context, we remark that also sequence-related Baeyer­Villiger monooxygenases, e.g., cyclohexanone monooxygenase and phenylacetone monooxygenase (34, 35), probably use the same catalytic strategy. Indeed, for phenylacetone monooxygenase it has been shown that NADP is a prerequisite for efficient and

Location of hFMO3 Mutations and Polymorphisms. The remarkable

degree of sequence identity makes it interesting to locate mFMO residues corresponding to hFMO3 positions affected by pathological mutations and polymorphisms (11, 17). All classical TMAU-causing mutations target residues that are located either in the active site or in structurally relevant regions (Figs. 1B and 3A). Examples are the human mutation Asn61Ser that targets the catalytically crucial Asn-78 in mFMO and the Pro153Leu mutation (homologous to mFMO Pro-173) that targets a residue of the domain linker. Conversely, hFMO3 polymorphisms commonly observed in human populations concern positions that in

enantioselective catalysis (36) and its crystal structure predicts a NADP -binding mode identical to that found in FMOs, suggesting a similar mechanism of intermediate stabilization (37). To bring about the first of its two roles (reduction of FAD by hydride transfer; Fig. 1 A), NADPH coenzyme must occupy a

position different from that observed in our structure. A shift of the ribose ring of NADP coenzyme might be enough to move the nicotinamide ring to a position productive for hydride transfer. However, our repeated observation that soaking mFMO crystals in a solution of fresh NADPH rapidly bleaches and cracks them rather suggests that a relative domain rotation could be involved in promoting FAD reduction by NADPH. A similar movement has been hypothesized for proteins with similar topology (38) and in the catalytic mechanism of phenylacetone monooxygenase (37). In conclusion, in FMOs and related monooxygenases, NADP(H) has two binding modes likely to be associated to distinct protein conformational states; the first binding mode along the catalytic cycle promotes FAD reduction through hydride transfer, whereas the second mode exerts stabilization of the crucial catalytic intermediate, a sort of moonlighting activity of NADP(H). Materials and Methods
Crystallization and Structure Determination. Gene cloning and protein expression and purification were carried out by using standard protocols as described in SI Text. Wild-type mFMO crystallized in many conditions using low-molecular-weight PEGs as precipitant. However, these crystals were affected by twinning. Conversely, mutant FMO E158A/E159A (SI Text) gave crystals of a different form in microbatch technique at 4°C by mixing equal volumes of 8 mg of protein/ml in Tris HCl 25 mM, pH 8.0; NaCl 250 mM; NADP 1 mM and of PEG4000 20% (wt/vol) in Na/Hepes 0.1 M, pH 7.5. These crystals were not affected by twinning and could be used for structure determination. Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) and processed with the CCP4 package (39). The structure was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method (Table 2) by using SHELXD (40) and SHARP (41). The resulting electron density map was

used in molecular replacement calculations to solve the structure of the native (nonselenomethionine-substituted) enzyme. Phases were further improved by multiple-crystal density averaging with DMMULTI (39). All subsequent model-building and refinement calculations were done by using data from the native crystals. The initial model was traced with ARP/wARP (42). The programs COOT (43) and Refmac5 (29) were used for model rebuilding and refinement (Table 3). Figures were generated by using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific; www.pymol.org). Kinetic Assays. Kinetic assays were performed in duplicate at 25°C on a Varian spectrophotometer (Cary 100 Bio) equipped with a thermostatic cell compartment. A 1-ml mixture containing mFMO 0.1­ 0.2 M; Tris HCl 25 mM, pH 8.5; NaCl 35 mM; 0.1 mM NADPH (dissolved in NaOH 20 mM) was equilibrated for

2 min; the reaction was triggered by addition of substrate and followed by decrease in absorbance at 340 nm ( 340 6.22 mM 1 cm 1 for NADPH). All substrates (Table 1) were dissolved in water except N,N-dimethylaniline (dissolved in ethanol). Km for NADPH was measured by using a fixed trimethylamine concentration (2 mM) and varying NADPH concentrations (0 ­230 M). To generate the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (Fig. 2, trace B), an aerated solution of NADPH 7 M was added to a solution of mFMO (7 M in KPi 100 mM, pH 7.4) in a final volume of 1 ml at 4°C.
