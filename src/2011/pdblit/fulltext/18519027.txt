School of Biological Sciences & Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92010, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Received 24 February 2009; received in revised form 20 April 2009; accepted 21 April 2009 Available online 24 April 2009 Enzymes from the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway have been exploited for the development of anti-cancer drugs, and represent novel targets for anti-bacterial drug development. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of tuberculosis, this pathway has been identified as essential for growth and survival. The structure of M. tuberculosis PurN (MtPurN) has been determined in complex with magnesium and iodide at 1.30 Å resolution, and with cofactor analogue, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure shows a Rossmann-type fold that is very similar to the known structures of the human and E. coli PurN proteins. In contrast, MtPurN forms a dimer that is quite different from that formed by the Escherichia coli PurN, and which suggests a mechanism whereby communication could take place between the two active sites. Differences are seen in two active site loops and in the binding mode of the 5MTHF cofactor analogue between the two MtPurN molecules of the dimer. A binding site for halide ions is found in the dimer interface, and bound magnesium and iodide ions in the active site suggest sites that might be exploited in potential drug discovery strategies.

cules, as secondary messengers, or neurotransmitters. 1,2 Nucleotides can be obtained by two different routes: synthesis via the de novo pathway, or salvage from breakdown products of nucleic acids. The function of most normal cells (except liver and T-cells) relies on the salvage of purines, whereas tumour cells cannot salvage purines efficiently and depend on de novo synthesis.3 The de novo purine biosynthesis pathway consists of ten enzymatic reactions,4 two of which involve folate-dependent enzymes: glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (PurN) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase (PurH). PurN, the subject of this report, catalyses the third step of the purine biosynthesis pathway and transfers the formyl group from N 10 -formyl-tetrahydrofolate (fTHF) to glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) to produce formyl-glycinamide ribonucleotide (fGAR) and tetrahydrofolate5 as shown in Fig. 1a. Exploiting the requirement of tumour cells for de novo purine biosynthesis, PurN has been deve-

The molecular structures of the cofactor N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate and cofactor analogue 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate are also shown. (b) Subdomain structure of PurN. The PurN protein consists of two subdomains, an N-terminal subdomain (coloured green and labelled N) and a C-terminal subdomain (coloured red and labelled C). Residue numbers appropriate to each protein are shown above the bar diagrams. The MtPurN structure (left) is coloured by subdomain structure with the active site cavity delineated by white CPK models of GAR and cofactor 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate.

developed on the basis of differences between viral and human enzymes involved in purine metabolism,3 but enzymes from the purine biosynthetic pathway have not been exploited for anti-bacterial

724 or anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug development, even though this pathway has been shown to be essential for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.7 Structures are available for two bacterial PurN enzymes, from Escherichia coli5,8 and Aquifex aeolicus (PDB code 2YWR), and one eukaryotic, the PurN domain9 of a trifunctional, three-domain human enzyme.10 All have the same fold, with a Rossmanntype / topology in which the active site cleft is located between the N- and C-terminal halves of the fold (Fig. 1b). The active site comprises a mainly hydrophobic pocket with a number of polar residues interacting with the substrate and cofactor.5 A proposed catalytic triad comprising Asn106, His108 and Asp144 (E. coli numbering) is conserved in all homologous PurN enzymes (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). Mechanistic studies suggest that the amino group of GAR carries out a nucleophilic attack on the formyl carbon of fTHF to form a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate and that any two of the catalytic triad residues could activate the amino group of GAR.11 Reported crystal structures for E. coli and human PurN contain numerous examples of ligand binding, including substrate GAR, cofactor analogues, cofactor-based inhibitors, as well as structures with multisubstrate adduct inhibitors. 5,8,9,12­15 This wealth of information has played a major part in the structure-based drug discovery of antifolate compounds for cancer chemotherapy and provides an important knowledge base for the design of potential antibacterial agents, once the similarities and differences between bacterial and human enzymes have been mapped. Given the slow growth and persistence of M. tuberculosis bacilli, compounds that target purine biosynthesis are attractive drug development options. M. tuberculosis and human PurN proteins share 36% sequence identity, translating to potentially significant structural differences to be exploited for selective drug discovery. Here, we report structures for M. tuberculosis PurN (MtPurN) in its apo state, but with Mg2+ and iodide bound, and in complex with the cofactor analogue 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF). The details of cofactor and ligand (Mg2+ and I-) binding in the active site provide key information for future structure-based anti-TB drug design. We found that MtPurN forms a dimer that is completely different from that found for E. coli PurN, and which appears to impact on the cofactor binding site. Subtle differences in the loops that mediate substrate and cofactor binding suggest possible opportunities for selective anti-TB drug design.

Its structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.30 Å resolution to an R-factor of 0.165 and Rfree of 0.186 (Table 1). The structure of the cofactor complex, in which 5MTHF is bound to MtPurN, was then determined from crystals in space group P21 grown from a crystallisation solution consisting of 0.18 M magnesium nitrate, 20% PEG3350, and subsequently soaked in 5 mM 5MTHF. The complex structure was refined at 2.2 Å resolution to an R-factor of 0.184 and Rfree of 0.243 (Table 1). The two crystal forms grow under essentially the same conditions and are morphologically indistinguishable. Both forms contain two MtPurN molecules in the asymmetric unit and are found to contain equivalent dimers, formed by crystallographic symmetry (the two molecules of the asymmetric unit do not form a dimer). Overall structure The MtPurN monomer displays a Rossmann fold consisting of a mixed seven-stranded -sheet surrounded by six -helices (Fig. 2a). Outside the basic

(b) The MtPurN dimer, highlighting the two iodide ions in the intermolecular interface. Monomer A is coloured blue and monomer B is coloured yellow.

726 Rossmann fold, the C-terminal residues form two short antiparallel -strands (c1 and c2) and, together with strand n1 from the N-terminus, form a small three-stranded -sheet, which is exposed on the surface of the structure. The monomer can be divided into two sub-domains, representing the two halves of the Rossmann fold: the N-terminal subdomain (Val1 ­ Thr114) and the C-terminal subdomain (Leu115 ­ Gly215). The cleft between the Nand C-terminal sub-domains contains the active site and binds substrate and cofactor analogues as described for the E. coli and human PurN structures.5,8,9 The monomer structure is most similar to human PurN (HsPurN), with which it shares 36% sequence identity, with an overall root-mean-square difference (rmsd) in atomic coordinates of 1.28 Å for an alignment of 192 C atoms. The apo-MtPurN structure contains a magnesium ion in the active site of molecule A and an iodide ion in the phosphate-binding pocket of both molecules (identified by analogy with E. coli PurN (EcPurN)). The dimer interface contains a halidebinding pocket, which in this structure is occupied by two iodide ions, and a larger pocket in which a disordered -mercaptoethanol molecule binds. Additional iodide ions, derived from the crystallization medium, which contained 0.1 M NaI, are found in surface sites at occupancies varying from 0.33 to 1.0. The cofactor complex structure contains one molecule of 5MTHF in each active site of the dimer, one magnesium ion in the active site of molecule A, one nitrate ion, and two chloride ions (occupying the halide-binding pocket in the dimer interface). Although there are some local differences in the structures from the two space groups, the overall rmsd in atomic coordinates for the entire dimer, as calculated by SSM16 is only 1.81 Å over 408 C atom positions. The MtPurN dimer Both dynamic light-scattering and analytical gelfiltration chromatography show that M. tuberculosis PurN is dimeric in solution, and remains a dimer over a range of 0 ­ 250 mM NaCl. An analysis of the intermolecular interface using the EMBL-EBI PISA server17 reveals substantial contacts and an overall buried surface area of around 900 Å2. This analysis shows that the same dimer interface is formed in both crystal structures, with equivalent hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, indicating that this is the biologically relevant dimerization mode. Other interacting surfaces found in the MtPurN crystals have fewer contacts and smaller buried surface, and are not conserved between the orthorhombic and monoclinic crystal structures; these are most likely crystal contacts and not biologically relevant. The dimerization interface is formed by the symmetrical pairing of 6, 7 and 5 from two C-terminal sub-domains (Fig. 2b). The interface is primarily hydrophobic, with 57% of the interface residues being non-polar, and eight hydrogen bonds that link the two monomers, and a tyrosine

residue (Tyr137) that is inserted into the opposing monomer, stacking between Pro123 and Arg204. In the apo-MtPurN crystal structure, two iodide ions bind in a hydrophobic pocket within the dimer interface, in what we describe as a halide-binding pocket (Fig. 2c). The 5MTHF complex structure contains chloride ions in equivalent positions. In each case, the two halide ions are found sandwiched between two pairs of proline residues arranged on either side of a twofold axis. This proline "quartet" is unique to MtPurN. A molecule of -mercaptoethanol also binds in the interface; binding over a twofold symmetry axis, it is disordered over two orientations. The MtPurN dimer contrasts markedly with the dimer that is formed by the equivalent E. coli enzyme, EcPurN. The latter undergoes a pHdependent monomer­dimer transition near physiological pH that was proposed as an enzyme control mechanism; it is monomeric at pH greater than 7.4, but forms a dimer below pH 6.6.18 MtPurN, on the other hand, is dimeric over a large range of pH values. The two dimers also involve entirely different surfaces; the dimer formed by EcPurN is formed by the symmetrical pairing of 3, 2 and 3 of two N-terminal sub-domains, whereas that formed by MtPurN involves 6, 7 and 5 from two C-terminal sub-domains. This could be described as a head-to-head arrangement for EcPurN and a tail-to-tail arrangement for MtPurN (Fig. 3). The EcPurN dimer interface is also smaller than ´ that of MtPurN, measuring 786 Å 2 compared with ´ 2. 902 Å The human PurN protein (HsPurN), which forms one domain of a large trifunctional protein,10,19 displays a monomer­monomer interaction in the crystal structure of the HsPurN domain fragment that is similar to that seen for MtPurN, although the interface area is significantly less at 731 Å2, and this protein is regarded as monomeric.15 In its crystal structure (unpublished), A. aeolicus PurN (AaPurN) also forms the same dimer as that seen for MtPurN, and while there is no literature support for this dimerization, analysis with PISA gives Gint of ­24 kcal/mol and Gdiss of 17 kcal/mol for the AaPurN dimer. Comparison with the equivalent energies for MtPurN (Gint ­11 kcal/mol and Gdiss 1.6 kcal/mol) suggests that the AaPurN dimer is a highly favoured state in solution and thermodynamically stable.17 Sequence alignment of the Cterminal sub-domains of MtPurN, AaPurN, HsPurN and EcPurN show that whereas the residues involved in the tail-to-tail interface of MtPurN are well conserved in AaPurN (58% similarity) and HsPurN (42% similarity) they are least conserved in EcPurN (38% similarity) (Fig. 3). Likewise, the residues involved in the head-to-head EcPurN dimer are poorly conserved in both MtPurN and AaPurN (12% and 24%, respectively) and with HsPurN displaying a moderate similarity of 35%. These similarities account for the preference for a tail-to-tail dimer for MtPurN and AaPurN, but a distinctly different dimer for EcPurN.

N-terminal subdomains are coloured green and C-terminal subdomains are coloured red. Interface atoms are shown in white. MtPurN, AaPurN, and HsPurN dimerize between C-termini, while EcPurN dimerizes between N-termini.

Also highlighted are residues involved in the dimerization of EcPurN (black triangle on green bar) and MtPurN (black triangle on red bar).

Ion binding and loop variability in the substrate-binding site The natural substrate of PurN is the sugar derivative glycinamide ribonucleotide, in which the O5 hydroxyl of the ribose residue is phosphorylated and the O1 hydroxyl is substituted with glycinamide. In apo-MtPurN, both molecules contain an iodide ion bound in the positively charged pocket formed by the loop that connects 1 and 1 (Fig. 4a). This pocket, which derives its positive charge from the N-terminus of helix 1, is invariably the site of phosphate binding, either from inorganic phosphate or from the substrate phosphoryl moiety, in all structures of the E. coli and human PurN enzymes. In MtPurN, the iodide ion makes a long-range contact (3.7 Å) with the amide nitrogen of Leu26 and shorter contacts (3.3­3.5 Å) with three water molecules. A hydrogen bond network between the three water molecules and the protein backbone stabilises this site, particularly in the 1-1 loop

Leu18­Leu26. Although 166 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank contain iodide ions, most of these show surface binding motifs and we have found no site similar to ours. The apo-MtPurN active site also accommodates an magnesium ion, which is present in molecule A (not in molecule B) and binds in a pocket formed by Ala96, Asn116, Thr117, His118, His147, and Asp154 (Fig. 4b). The magnesium makes direct contacts to only two protein atoms, Thr117 O (2.3 Å) and Asn116 OD1 (2.6 Å), with the four remaining octahedral coordination sites occupied by water molecules (Mg-O 2.3­2.4 Å), all of which are directly hydrogen bonded to protein atoms. The Thr117 side chain hydrogen bonds to Glu183, maintaining an ideal orientation of Thr117 O for octahedral coordination to magnesium. Thr117 is conserved in Mycobacterium species but is not found in a range of other organisms, including bacteria, insects, plants, and other eukaryotes, where the equivalent residue is invariably leucine or isoleucine (Supple-

The iodide is shown as a large pink sphere binding adjacent to the phosphate of GAR (ball and stick model).

Conserved water molecules are shown for each structure as small spheres (blue MtPurN, yellow HsPurN).

mentary Data Fig. 1). The loop between 6 and 7 is disordered in molecule B but in molecule A moves approximately 2 Å towards the Mg2+ -binding site. As a result, water-mediated interactions are formed between the magnesium and protein residues Asp154 and His147 of the 6-7 loop. The residues equivalent to Asn116, His118 and Asp154 (Asn106, His108, and Asp144) have been proposed as catalytic residues in EcPurN, and are conserved in all PurN proteins (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). Mechanistic studies suggest that the amino group of GAR carries out a nucleophilic attack on the formyl carbon of fTHF and forms a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate. The position of the Mg2+ in the current M. tuberculosis structure approximates the expected position of the GAR -amino group, as deduced from substrate and substrate analogue binding studies on EcPurN and HsPurN.9,13­15,20 The interactions made by this Mg2+, if it is regarded as a surrogate for the GAR amino group, would be consistent with the involvement of Asn116, His118, and Asp154 in activation of this amino group to facilitate nucleophilic attack. At least two of the three amino acids Asn106, His108 and Asp144 in EcPurN are absolutely required for in vivo activity, and it has been suggested that any two of these three polar residues could activate the amino group of GAR.11 We cannot infer any biological relevance for Mg2+ binding to PurN, given that its concentration in the

crystallization mother liquor is 70 mM, some 70fold higher than the concentration of free Mg2+ in cells. A magnesium ion is utilised in a second GAR transformylase, PurT, found in various bacterial species, including E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and M. tuberculosis. PurT uses formate and Mg2+ATP to produce a formyl phosphate intermediate21 before transfer of the formyl group to GAR. There is little structural similarity between the active sites of PurN and PurT from E. coli,22,23 however, and we cannot detect formate or ATP binding for MtPurN (data not shown). Two binding modes for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the cofactor-binding site The PurN cofactor, N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (fTHF) is not commercially available, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was used in crystal-soaking experiments to mimic cofactor binding. Given the short half-life of 5MTHF due to hydrolysis (45 min), crystals were soaked for no longer than 5 min. 5MTHF binds in the active sites of both molecules in the complex structure, and displays 6R stereochemistry in both molecules, which is the opposite of the biologically relevant stereochemistry for the natural cofactor fTHF. Commercial preparations of 5MTHF are racemic mixtures of 6R and 6S stereoisomers, and the 6R form has presumably been selected in the crystal structure because it interacts more favour-

ably with MtPurN, and/or as a result of more favourable crystal packing for this complex. We hypothesise that the 5-methyl substituent imposes

the observed ring conformation and 6R chiral stereoselectivity through its protein contacts. We note that a very similar phenomenon is seen in the

730 binding of a high-affinity, folate-based inhibitor to the human PurN, in which the 6R isomer is also selected preferentially.15 In both molecules of the asymmetric unit, the pteridine moiety of 5MTHF binds in a deep active site pocket formed by three loops, the 4-4 loop (residues 97­103), the 5-5 loop (residues 119­129) and the 6-7 loop (residues 148­156). The latter is referred to as the folate binding loop because of the way it folds over the pteridine moiety, and it is highly flexible in many PurN structures. The pteridine-binding mode is very similar in both molecules of the dimer, although not identical (see Fig. 5a and b). This is because the folate-binding loop is fully closed in molecule A but partially flipped back in molecule B (Fig. 5c). The pteridine-binding mode is also essentially identical with that seen for fTHF analogues bound to EcPurN13 and HsPurN,15 and its interactions are clearly the major determinant of cofactor binding. The full hydrogen bonding potential of the pteridine moiety is utilised in short, geometrically favourable hydrogen bonds that involve almost exclusively PurN main chain atoms, from residues 100­102 and residues 150­154 of the folate-binding loop (Fig. 5). The only exception involves an integral water molecule, which is observed also in the EcPurN and HsPurN complex structures. Intriguingly, beyond the pteridine ring system, the 5MTHF-binding mode differs in several important respects between the two molecules. In the molecule B conformation (5MTHF-b), the p-aminobenzamide moiety makes only minimal contact with the protein, hydrogen bonding via its carbonyl oxygen and through water-mediated interactions. The glutamate tail of 5MTHF-b is not observed and is presumably located in the bulk solvent and disordered. In contrast, in molecule A the whole 5MTHF molecule (5MTHF-a) is clearly observed. Here, the aminobenzyl-glutamate portion of the cofactor wraps back towards the active site with the glutamate moiety well ordered and its -carboxylate binding directly to the Mg2+ found in the molecule A active site. These conformational differences are associated with movements of the two loops that enclose the cofactor, the 5-5 loop and particularly the folate-binding loop 6-7. The full closure of the latter in molecule A inserts the key residue Asp154 into the active site, where it interacts with the Mg2+ (Fig. 5c). Although another molecule packs near this region in the crystal, complicating the analysis, solvent space still exists for the 5MTHF-a "glutamate tail" to be oriented into bulk solvent in a way similar to that seen for 5MTHF-b. The Mg2+ is located in a position similar to that of the apo structure and, as in that structure, is found in only one of the two independent molecules (molecule A) of the dimer, even though the crystal mother liquor contains a high concentration of Mg2+ (around 140 mM). This Mg2+ coordinates two water molecules: one of these is hydrogen bonded directly to the three critical active site residues Asn116, His118 and Asp154, and the

Glycinamide Ribonucleotide Transformylase

other is involved in a network of hydrogen bonds with the -carboxylate of 5MTHF-a and protein residues from the polypeptide loop 93­103. A final and important feature of the cofactor region is the insertion of the Tyr137 side chain from the opposing monomer of the PurN dimer (Fig. 5c). The tyrosine ring inserts between the side chains of Pro123 and Arg204, stabilised in this binding mode by plane-to-plane stacking, and forms watermediated hydrogen bonds with Asp154 from the folate-binding loop (Fig. 5c). It is thus in a position to influence the conformations of the two flexible active site loops 119­129 and 148­156 directly, and so impact on binding and catalysis by MtPurN. Given the differences in magnesium binding, 5MTHF binding and active site loop conformations between the two molecules of the complex structure (Fig. 5), the tyrosine insertion could provide an allosteric signal between the two sites, and suggests a role for dimerization in activity/regulation. We sought to determine whether this tyrosine insertion (including the partner residues Pro123 and Arg204) is unique to MtPurN or occurs in the PurN enzymes of other organisms. The KEGG SSDB database was searched and the resulting multiple sequence alignments over a very broad range of species suggest that this tyrosine insertion is not unique but is found in a limited subset of species. A pattern is clearly seen: Pro123 is highly conserved across all species and Tyr137 is paired almost exclusively with Arg204. The Tyr137/Arg204 pair is found in only 1 of 73 eukaryotic sequences, but in N50 % of the top 100 bacterial sequences, and in 31% of archaeal sequences. Substitution of Tyr137, commonly with Ala or Thr, almost invariably accompanies a substitution of Arg204. These data suggest that other bacterial and archaeal species form an MtPurN-like dimer and that their activity may be under allosteric control. The crystal structure and predicted dimer of A. aeolicus PurN support this hypothesis. We have predicted that AaPurN forms a strong dimer in solution. Additionally, the structure contains the conservative substitution of Tyr137 for phenylalanine, and this residue is sandwiched between a proline and an arginine as in the MtPurN structure. Conclusions and implications for drug design The structural analysis of MtPurN shows that the mycobacterial enzyme closely resembles the human PurN enzyme in terms of both overall fold and active site structure. The active sites of M. tuberculosis and human proteins display an rmsd of 0.97 Å for an alignment of 51 C atoms, which reflects a 49% sequence identity and 75% sequence similarity in these residues. The similarities in protein structure, particularly in the active site, suggest that the inhibitors that have been developed for the human

731 and point to differences between the MtPurN and HsPurN structures that might be exploited in selective inhibition of MtPurN. Firstly, the loop containing Ala96 is displaced, either by the bulk of the iodide or to alleviate contacts with helix 1, thereby changing the GAR binding site shape and contacts. Secondly, Ala19 in MtPurN replaces a bulkier isoleucine, which is the equivalent residue in both HsPurN and EcPurN, and this generates a larger and deeper pocket that accommodates the bulky iodide in MtPurN. An inhibitor incorporating an iodide or some equivalent bulky group in this site could introduce inhibition selectivity for MtPurN over HsPurN.

protein in the course of anti-cancer drug development could serve as useful lead compounds for the design of anti-mycobacterial drugs based on the structure of MtPurN. There are, however, notable differences in the mycobacterial enzyme. In particular, we find that it differs significantly in its quaternary structure, forming a dimer that is completely different from the pH-dependent dimer formed by EcPurN and that contrasts with the monomeric human PurN domain. This dimer persists in solution and is the same in two different crystal forms with very different crystal packing. A key feature of the dimer is the insertion of a tyrosine residue, Tyr137, into the opposing monomer in contact with the active site loops that enclose the cofactor. This provides a potential structural mechanism for communication between the two active sites of the dimer. Also notable is the fact that in both the apo-PurN structure and the 5MTHF complex there are differences between the two active sites. In the apo structure, molecule A contains a Mg2+ in the active site, at the position where the GAR -amino group should bind, and has an ordered folate-binding loop, whereas molecule B has no Mg2+ and the folate binding loop is disordered. In the 5MTHF complex, again one molecule (molecule A) has a Mg2+ bound, a closed folate-binding loop and a well ordered conformation for the 5MTHF that is likely to model the physiologically-relevant cofactor conformation. In contrast, there is no Mg2+in molecule B , the folate-binding loop is partially flipped back and although, the pteridine ring is similarly (but not identically) bound, much of the rest of the 5MTHF is disordered. We propose that these differences are linked to dimer formation and communication via Tyr137 and its interaction with the folate-binding loop. Finally, the Mg2+ and iodide ions that are bound in the apo-MtPurN structure point to sites that could be exploited in drug design. The Mg2+ identifies an important potential docking site for positively charged groups of inhibitors. The key residues involved in magnesium binding are conserved across all species, yet none of the E. coli or human crystal structures contains active site metals, nor are these proteins known to exhibit a magnesium dependency for activity. Intriguingly, however, the A. aeolicus crystal structure contains both cobalt and magnesium cations, with the cobalt ion in a site similar to that of the MtPurN magnesium, making water-mediated interactions with the Asp154 equivalent. We surmise that metal binding results from dimer formation and from the subtle active site changes induced by this process, and that this represents a suitable difference between host and pathogen that could be exploited for drug design. Further investigation of this hypothesis is warranted but is beyond the scope of this study. The iodide ion is positioned 4.5 Å away from the phosphate of the natural GAR substrate in human PurN, and is deeper in the substrate pocket (Fig. 4a). Two structural features account for this observation,

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification The purN gene (Rv0956) was amplified by PCR from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using the primers:
5- GGCAGCGGCGCGGTGCAGGAACCGCTTCG - 3 5- GAAAGCTGGGTGTCATC CTATGGTTACC - 3

The construct was cloned into the N-terminal His6tagged pDEST17 vector (Invitrogen) using the Gateway cloning system, and PurN protein was over-expressed in E. coli (BL21 DE3) using an autoinduction protocol.24 An overnight culture was prepared by inoculating 5 mL of PA0.5G medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 g/L) and incubating at 37 °C with shaking at 160 rpm. Overnight cultures were transferred into 1 L of ZYP-5052 medium and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 160 rpm. At an A600 of 0.7 (4 h), the cell culture was cooled to 4 °C, kept at that temperature for 1 h and then incubated with shaking at 160 rpm for 18 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min at 4 °C and suspended in buffer A (25 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA). Cells were lysed using a cell disrupter (Constant Cell Disruption System) and the resulting supernatant was passed over a Ni2+-loaded immobilised metal-affinity column (IMAC) for the initial purification. The His6 tag was removed by treatment with recombinant tobacco etch virus (rTEV) protease and the preparation was subjected to a second IMAC step to remove His6-tagged rTEV protease and uncleaved PurN. The final purification step involved concentrating PurN to 20 mg/mL and passage through a size-exclusion chromatography column (Superdex S200 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A, resulting in a single peak. Analytical gel-filtration chromatography was carried out using fresh protein standard solutions prepared with buffer A containing: ovalbumin (45 kDa, 7 mg/mL), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, 2 mg/mL), albumin (67 kDa, 7 mg/mL), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, 3 mg/mL) and blue Dextran 2000 (1 mg/mL). The retention times for the protein standards were compared with that of PurN to determine the oligomerization state of PurN. Crystallization and data collection The protein in buffer A was concentrated to 10 mg/mL and subjected to sitting-drop, vapour-diffusion experi-

ments by mixing 100 nL of protein solution and 100 nL of reservoir buffer from the Top67 crystallization screen.25 Initially, native PurN crystals grew from two conditions: 0.2 M magnesium nitrate with 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350; and 0.2 M NaI with 20% PEG 3350. Fine screening around these formulations (0.1 M magnesium formate, 0.1 M NaI, 20% PEG 3350) produced crystals that diffracted to 1.30 Å resolution. Crystals grown overnight to maximum dimensions of 250 m × 50 m × 50 m were dipped briefly in cryoprotectant (20% ethylene glycol in crystallisation buffer) and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before data collection. Data were collected at beamline BL9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) equipped with ADSC Quantum-315 CCD detector. Crystals with cofactor analogue bound were prepared by soaking pre-formed native crystals (from 0.18 M magnesium nitrate and 20% PEG 3350) with 5 mM (final concentration) 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF), which was added directly to the crystallisation drop. Soaking time was restricted to a maximum of 5 min to minimise hydrolysis of the cofactor analogue. X-ray data from the complex were collected at 110 K on a Rigaku MM007-HR rotating anode generator equipped with a Mar345 image plate detector, Osmic mirror focusing optics, and an Oxford Cryostream. All data were processed with MOSFLM and SCALA.26 Data collection statistics for native and 5MTHF complex crystals are summarised in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The apo-MtPurN protein structure was determined by automated molecular replacement using BALBES with the PDB model 1MEO (human PurN).27 Two molecules were located in the asymmetric unit that were subsequently refined with several cycles of manual building in COOT,28 and maximum likelihood refinement in REFMAC.29 A peak search of an Fo ­ Fc electron density map showed a number of peaks over 20 that were identified and refined as iodide anions with varying occupancy. Solvent molecules were added by automatic peak picking from Fo ­ Fc electron density maps using COOT and a magnesium ion was identified from its contacts and geometry with surrounding ligands. The stereochemistry of the structure was evaluated using MOLPROBITY.30 The final model of apo-MtPurN in space group P212121 was refined at 1.30 Å resolution and contains two protein molecules, with 212 residues (3­215) in molecule A and 206 residues (4­210) in molecule B, 9 iodide ions, 1 magnesium ion, 1 mercaptoethanol molecule, and 449 water molecules. The refinement statistics are summarised in Table 1. The MtPurN-5MTHF structure in space group P21 was determined by molecular replacement using the final apoMtPurN structure as the search model. Refinement proceeded as for the apo structure, but with the addition of two (partial) molecules of 5MTHF with coordinates and restraints produced using the Dundee PRODRG2 server.31 Water molecules were added automatically using COOT and were included in the refinement. The final model, refined at 2.20 Å resolution, contains two molecules with 205 residues (3­208) in molecule A and 204 residues (4­ 208) in molecule B, two 5MTHF molecules, two chloride ions, one magnesium ion, one nitrate ion, and 286 water molecules. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarised in Table 1. The figures were prepared with PyMOL.  http://www.pymol.org
