Tryptophan 7-Halogenase (PrnA) Structure Suggests a Mechanism for Regioselective Chlorination
Changjiang Dong,1 Silvana Flecks,2 Susanne Unversucht,2 ´ Caroline Haupt,2 Karl-Heinz van Pee,2 James H. Naismith1*
Chlorinated natural products include vancomycin and cryptophycin A. Their biosynthesis involves regioselective chlorination by flavin-dependent halogenases. We report the structural characterization of tryptophan 7halogenase (PrnA), which regioselectively chlorinates tryptophan. Tryptophan and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are separated by a 10 angstrom­long tunnel and bound by distinct enzyme modules. The FAD module is conserved in halogenases and is related to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. On the basis of biochemical studies, crystal structures, and by analogy with monooxygenases, we predict that FADH2 reacts with O2 to make peroxyflavin, which is ­ decomposed by Cl . The resulting HOCl is guided through the tunnel to tryptophan, where it is activated to participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution. In addition to man-made chemicals, there are nearly 4000 chlorinated and brominated natural products (1), including drugs such as vancomycin (2), rebeccamycin (3), and cryptophycin A (4). The de novo chemical synthesis of complex natural products is often too expensive or too difficult to be practical. Their production relies on fermentation, and introducing diversity in such molecules requires protein engineering. This has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the molecular basis of the biological regioselective halogenation mechanism. Metal-dependent haloperoxidases were once thought to catalyze all halogenation reactions in biology and fall into two classes. Both heme-iron-dependent enzymes (5) and vanadium-dependent enzymes (6) have been structurally characterized. Although different in structure, both form a metal-bound hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with halide ions to produce a metalbound hypohalite ion. This ion dissociates from the metal as hypohalous acid (5, 6), where in solution it reacts with substrate. Such halogenation lacks regioselectivity and substrate specificity (7). Perhydrolases are now recognized not to be involved in halometabolite biosynthesis (8). A new halogenase was reported by Dairi et al. identifying the gene for the chlorinating enzyme in chlorotetracycline biosynthesis (9). The gene product showed no similarity to haloperoxidases.

domonas fluorescens identified two related genes ( prnA and prnC ), coding for two halogenating enzymes (10) (fig. S1). Both contain a flavin binding site (9­13) and exhibit weak sequence homology to flavindependent monooxygenase enzymes (14). PrnA catalyzes the regioselective chlorination of the 7 position of tryptophan (15). Turnover requires that FAD is reduced to FADH2 (by flavin reductase) and that O2 is present (11). Members of this halogenase superfamily have been identified in the biosynthetic pathways of the antibiotics balhimycin (16) and vancomycin (2), the antitumor agent rebeccamycin (3), and other halometabolites (7, 17­21). It is likely that regiospecific halogenation reactions carried out by bacteria are predominately catalyzed by flavin-dependent halogenases. To account for the regioselectivity, two mecha-

nisms have been proposed. In one, the substrate is oxidized to an epoxide, which is decomposed by a nucleophilic attack of Cl­ (11). In the other, direct chlorination by a high-energy flavin hypochlorite intermediate occurs (22, 23). The use of HOCl as the halogenating agent has been explicitly discounted because of its reactivity and regioselectivity (11, 23). PrnA was purified from a P. fluorescens expression system, and its structure was determined to 1.95 ). The structure consists of residues 2 to 518 (Fig. 1A) and is a dimer (fig. S2A). Each monomer is a single domain, shaped like a box with a triangular pyramid stuck to one face (Fig. 1A). The box, which we identify as the FAD binding module, is dominated by two large b sheets (Fig. 1A). FAD is bound in a solventexposed groove adjacent to the large parallel b sheet (Fig. 1A). The C4-N5 edge of the isoalloxazine ring sits above one face of the mainly antiparallel b sheet (Fig. 1, A and B). Sequence alignment shows that only the flavin binding module is conserved in flavin-dependent halogenases (fig. S3). Conserved residues map to this module, and some of these residues are conserved in the monooxygenase enzymes (fig. S3). The flavin binding module of PrnA is structurally similar to p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) (24), a monooxygenase (fig. S4). Cl­ is bound in a pocket on one face of the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 1B) and makes contacts with the amide nitrogen atoms of Thr348 (T348) and Gly349 (G349) (25). No other Cl­ is experimentally located despite the presence of 50 mM NaCl, and we identify this as the Cl­ binding site. The amide backbone is known to bind negative ions and is proposed to bind F­ ion in the fluorinase structure (26). Complexes with tryptophan and 7-chlorotryptophan were obtained by incubating the protein, before

crystallization, with each. Tryptophan (Fig. 1C) and 7-chlorotryptophan (fig. S5B) are bound by the pyramid, which we denote as the substrate binding module (Fig. 1A). The protein structures are similar, with the compounds bound in an essentially identical manner. The discussion focuses on the higher resolution tryptophan complex. There is no substantial change in the protein structure upon tryptophan binding; the most notable difference is increased disorder in the loop between b2 and a2 at G48, adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring (fig. S5C). FAD and Cl­ are bound at the same positions as in the native enzyme. One face of the tryptophan ring stacks against H101 and W455 (25), the other face against F103 (Fig. 1C). The indole nitrogen is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of E346. The amino group of tryptophan makes a salt link with E450 and hydrogen bonds to other residues. The carboxylate group is also hydrogen bonded to the protein (Fig. 1C). We have obtained an FADH2 structure by reducing the enzyme with dithionite. The crystals, obtained in the absence of Cl , have an empty Cl binding site. The isoalloxazine ring is bent and slightly changes its interaction with surrounding residues (fig. S5, C and D). The loop at G48 undergoes a conformational change, and the helices capping the tryptophan binding site become disordered (fig. S5C). Together with the observation that in substrate and product complexes the G48 loop is less well ordered, it suggests there is communication between the modules regulating the enzyme. The mechanism of flavin-dependent monooxygenases is well established (27, 28). These enzymes are reduced to give FADH2, which then binds molecular oxygen to form a spectroscopically characterized highly reactive peroxide-linked flavin (27, 28). This intermediate is decomposed by the nucleophilic attack of an adjacent phenolate substrate, resulting in oxygen atom transfer. Consistent with this established mechanism (27, 28), we and others (11, 23) propose that in PrnA FADH2 binds O2, forming the same peroxide-linked isoalloxazine ring (Scheme 1). There is no moiety in PrnA

that appears capable of binding or interacting with O2 other than FADH2. In PrnA unlike PHBH, there is no room for an organic molecule to bind adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring, and the substrate is 10 ) distant. We see no indication of a large conformation change that could bring tryptophan and flavin together. Furthermore, the Cl­ ion binding site is over 10 ) from 7-chlorotrytophan and no other Cl­ binding site has been located. These observations seem to disfavor mechanisms involving direct transformation of substrate by oxygen linked to flavin (11) or flavin hypochlorite (22, 23). We cannot entirely eliminate these mechanisms because large conformational changes could take place. However, we postulate that the chlorinating agent created from flavin peroxide ­ moves 10 ) to the tryptophan. In PrnA, Cl is bound on the opposite face of FAD from the solvent and near to the entrance of the tunnel leading to the tryptophan (Fig. 1B). Cl­ is positioned to make a nucleophilic attack on the flavin peroxide, resulting in the formation of hydroxylated FAD and

HOCl (Scheme 1). The formation of HOCl from peroxides is well known in chemistry. Close to the expected site of this reaction, a water molecule is hydrogen bounded to S347 (Fig. 1B). PrnA incubated with 5-methylindole results in the formation of 3-chloro-5-methylindole (29) (fig. S6). We have established that, in solution, the substrate mimic 5-methylindole reacts with HOCl to give 3-chloro-5-methylindole (fig. S7). In order to confirm the enzyme reaction was not due to adventitious HOCl production, we tested PrnA for its ability to chlorinate monochlorodimedone (MCD). MCD, which is much more reactive than 5methylindole, is chlorinated by free HOCl and is used to assay haloperoxidases (5, 30) (fig. S6). MCD does not inhibit and is not chlorinated by PrnA (fig. S8), indicating that MCD does not access the tryptophan binding site. It establishes that production of 3-chloro-5-methylindole by enzyme does not arise from the presence of HOCl in solution. 5-Methylindole inhibits PrnA, consistent with it accessing the tryptophan binding site. The chlorinating agent at the tryptophan site has identical reactivity to that of HOCl (with respect to 5-methylindole). These data are consistent with the proposal that HOCl is created and channeled by PrnA. Modeling suggests PrnA binds 5-methylindole orienting its 3 position toward the tunnel (fig. S9). We propose HOCl is generated by the conserved flavin binding module and is therefore general to all flavin-dependent halogenases, irrespective of substrate or halogen (Cl or Br). The 10 ) tunnel is lined by the polypeptide main chain and the side chains of residues I82, K79, I52, and S347 (25) (Fig. 2A). These would not be oxidized or chlorinated by HOCl. W272 and W274 are remote from the site of HOCl formation, and, in any event, on its own tryptophan is not chlorinated by HOCl (23). We suggest that HOCl, after formation, is prevented from diffusing into solvent by the protein structure and instead enters this tunnel, moving toward tryptophan. In the native PrnA structure, K79 makes a hydrogen bond with a water molecule located at the end of the tunnel adjacent to the Cl atom of 7chlorotryptophan (Fig. 2A). K79 may hydrogen bond to HOCl and thus position it to react with tryptophan. In the absence of this water molecule, there is a cavity centered on the 7 position of tryptophan (Fig. 2A). We propose the basis for regioselective halogenation is the controlled spatial presentation of HOCl to substrate. There is a chemical precedent for this; in solution HOCl reacts with anisole resulting in p- and o- substitution. By first adding cyclodextrin, which is thought to wrap around anisole masking the o-positions, it has been shown that only psubstitution occurs (31). Electrophilic addition of chlorine to tryptophan proceeds through a Wheland intermediate (Fig. 2B). This intermediate would be stabilized by interaction with E346, reminiscent of but reversed in polarity from p cation interactions (32, 33). E346 is positioned to deprotonate the intermediate, leading to product (Fig. 2, A and B). Tryptophan is less reactive than other aromatics and in solution is not chlorinated by HOCl (23). A more electrophilic source of Cl than HOCl is known to be required (23). If K79 does hydrogen bond to HOCl, it would activate Cl by increasing its electrophilicity (Fig. 2B), allowing it to chlorinate tryptophan. Such a spatially constrained activating step may not only accomplish halogenation of less reactive substrates but could protect nearby tryptophan residues. In our assay, the native enzyme has a low kcat of 0.1 minj1 (fig. S10); however, rebeccamycin halogenase is also slow with a kcat of 1.4 minj1 (23). We find no detectable activity for a K79YA79 mutant, consistent with K79 playing a key role in guiding and activating HOCl. The kcat for PrnA E346Q (an E346YQ346 mutant) is decreased by about two orders of magnitude; KM is unchanged (fig. S11). This supports our proposed role for E346 (Fig. 2B) in stabilization and deprotonation of the intermediate. Halogenation using HOCl is well known in nature and organic chemistry, yet it lacks the reactivity and regioselectivity required for biosynthetic pathways. We suggest that with halogenases biology has evolved a remarkable mechanism of generating, activating, and controlling HOCl.

The Wheland intermediate is shown in square brackets and would be stabilized by interaction with E346. K79 in the apo structure makes three hydrogen bonds, suggesting a polar environment for the NZ atom, consistent with a protonated NZ atom. The indole ring stacks with W455 and H101 on one face and F103 on the other, which may further stabilize the intermediate.

Rev1 Employs a Novel Mechanism of DNA Synthesis Using a Protein Template
Deepak T. Nair,1 Robert E. Johnson,2 Louise Prakash,2 Satya Prakash,2 Aneel K. Aggarwal1*
The Rev1 DNA polymerase is highly specialized for the incorporation of C opposite template G. We present here the crystal structure of yeast Rev1 bound to template G and incoming 2¶-deoxycytidine 5¶-triphosphate (dCTP), which reveals that the polymerase itself dictates the identity of the incoming nucleotide, as well as the identity of the templating base. Template G and incoming dCTP do not pair with each other. Instead, the template G is evicted from the DNA helix, and it makes optimal hydrogen bonds with a segment of Rev1. Also, unlike other DNA polymerases, incoming dCTP pairs with an arginine rather than the templating base, which ensures the incorporation of dCTP over other incoming nucleotides. This mechanism provides an elegant means for promoting proficient and error-free synthesis through N2-adducted guanines that obstruct replication. Rev1, a member of the eukaryotic Y family DNA polymerases, is highly specific for incorporating a C opposite template G (1, 2). In this respect, Rev1 differs not only from the replicative and repair polymerases (Pols), which incorporate the correct nucleotide opposite all four template bases with nearly equivalent catalytic efficiencies, but it differs
