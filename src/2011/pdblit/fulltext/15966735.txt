ABSTRACT: Mutagenesis of the conserved tyrosine (Y370) of the Micromonospora Viridifaciens sialidase to small amino acids changes the mechanism of catalysis from retention of anomeric configuration to inversion [Watson, J. N., et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 12682-12690]. For the Y370G mutant enzymecatalyzed hydrolysis of a series of aryl sialosides and 3-sialyllactose, the derived Brønsted parameters ( lg) on kcat and kcat/Km are -0.63 ( 0.05 and -0.80 ( 0.08, respectively. Thus, for the Y370G enzyme, glycosidic C-O bond cleavage is rate-determining. Analysis of the activity of the Y370G mutant and wild-type enzymes against a substrate [3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[3,2-c]pyridinium R-D-N-acetylneuraminide (DHP-RNeu5Ac)] whose hydrolysis cannot be accelerated by acid catalysis is consistent with these reactions proceeding via SN1 and SN2 mechanisms, respectively. The overall structure of the Y370G mutant sialidase active site is very similar to the previously reported wild-type structure [Gaskell, A., et al. (1995) Structure 3, 1197-1205], although removal of the tyrosine residue creates two significant changes to the active site. First, the anomeric oxygen atom of the hydrolysis product ( -N-acetylneuraminic acid) and four water molecules bind in the large cavity created by the Y370G mutation. Second, the side chain of Asn310 moves to make a strong hydrogen bond to one of the bound water molecules.

The enzymes that cleave the terminal sialic acid residues, which are R-ketosidically linked to glycoconjugates, are exosialidases (N-acetylneuraminosyl glycohydrolase, neuraminidase, EC 3.2.1.18) (1). These enzymes are involved in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including influenza and cholera (2, 3). Within the exo-sialidase superfamily, sequence homology and X-ray crystal structure data have revealed that seven amino acid residues are strictly conserved (4). Three of these seven residues, a conserved tyrosine and a pair of acidic residues (glutamic and aspartic acid), are thought to comprise the basic catalytic assembly (4). A salient feature of all known exo-sialidases is that catalysis occurs with retention of the anomeric configuration (5-7). Recently, Withers and co-workers have shown that the acid-base catalyst mutant (D59A) trans-sialidase from Trypanosoma cruzi becomes covalently modified on the active site tyrosine residue during the slow turnover of 3-fluoro-R-D-N-acetylneuraminosyl fluoride (8, 9), a finding consistent with a tyrosine residue being the catalytic nucleophile. A similar conclusion was reached by Watson et al. (10), who reported that three tyrosine mutants of the Micromonospora Viridifaciens sialidase (Y370A, Y370D, and Y370G) were catalytically active inverting enzymes. In other

words, replacement of the nucleophilic tyrosine residue with a smaller amino acid changes the mechanism of hydrolysis from one involving two inversions of configuration via a tyrosinyl-bound intermediate to one in which a bound water molecule gives rise to a direct displacement reaction that entails a single inversion of configuration. On the basis of structural (11), kinetic (12), and computational (13) studies, it has been proposed that the conserved aspartic acid residue acts as a general acid catalyst. Furthermore, Watson et al. (14) concluded that the contribution of this residue to catalysis is much more important for the hydrolysis of natural substrates than for the corresponding reactions of aryl N-acetylneuraminides. It is perhaps surprising that M. Viridifaciens Y370 mutant sialidases possess close to wild-type activity against moderately activated substrates, but it is possible that for good leaving groups the conserved glutamic acid residue can assist the nucleophilic attack of the bound water molecule via a general base-catalyzed process. In contrast, nucleophilic mutants of acetal-processing glycosidases display a much greater reduction in their catalytic activity when water is the nucleophile. For example, Wang et al. noted that the E358A mutant -glucosidase from Agrobacterium displayed a kcat value that is reduced by a factor of greater than 107 in comparison to that of the wild-type enzyme for the hydrolysis of the activated substrate 2,4-dinitrophenyl glucoside (15). Moreover, Wang et al. noted that the activity of their nucleophilic mutant could be rescued by the addition of strong, small anionic nucleophiles such as formate and azide (15), and similar observations have been reported for other mutant acetal-processing glycosidases (16-19).

Newstead et al. inhibition (using GraFit). To determine whether the Y370G mutant can hydrate DANA, NMR experiments were performed using 10 mM DANA in tartrate buffer (10 mM in D2O at pD 5.3) at room temperature. The concentration of the enzyme in the reaction was one-tenth of that used to determine the stereochemical outcome of MURNeuAc hydrolysis (10). The DANA-containing reaction was monitored for 20 h. Protein Crystallization. The purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg/mL in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals appeared within 1-2 weeks at 293 K in drops composed of 2 µL of protein solution and 2 µL of mother liquor containing 13% (w/w) PEG 3350 and 0.2 M sodium fluoride. The crystals were soaked in situ with 40 mM DHP-RNeu5Ac for 30 min at 293 K. Crystals were cryoprotected in 20% (w/v) glycerol in the crystallization buffer for 1 min prior to being flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray Data Collection. Diffraction data were collected to 1.8 Å on a MAR CCD 3×3 detector on beamline ID14.3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The diffraction images were processed using MOSFLM (23) and scaled and merged using SCALA (24) from the CCP4 package (25). The data processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. The crystal belongs to space group P21, with the following unit cell dimensions: a ) 55.44 Å, b ) 49.54 Å, c ) 107.04 Å, and ) 101.74°. The crystal has a solvent content of 41.4% with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and a Mathews coefficient of 2.1 Å3 Da-1. Structure Determination. The starting model for crystallographic refinement was the 1.6 Å structure of the M. Viridifaciens D92G mutant sialidase reported previously (14), PDB entry 1W8N, which was in an orthorhombic P212121 unit cell. A molecular replacement solution in the new monoclinic cell was found using the complete model with AMoRE (26). Rigid body refinement of the three domains (residues 47-402, 403-502, and 503-647) was followed by restrained refinement using REFMAC5 (27), with iterative cycles of model building in O (28). Solvent molecules were added automatically using ARP/wARP (29) and visually inspected for correct placement in O (28). The final crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entry 2BER. RESULTS Enzyme Kinetics. Given in Table 2 are the kinetic parameters for the Y370G mutant M.

This paper details a complementary series of kinetic and structural studies that were performed on the Y370G mutant of the sialidase from M. Viridifaciens using a variety of substituted aryl R-D-N-acetylneuraminides (1), a natural substrate analogue (3-sialyllactose, 2), and a pyridinium R-DN-acetylneuraminide (3). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials. All chemicals were of analytical grade or better. MU-RNeu5Ac,1 PNP-RNeu5Ac, and phenyl R-D-N-acetylneuraminide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and 3SL was purchased from V-labs. DHP-RNeu5Ac (20) and DANA (21, 22) were synthesized according to literature procedures. Enzyme Kinetics. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions of DHP-RNeu5Ac were monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 266 nm ( ) -6221 M-1 cm-1) using a Cary 3E UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with the Cary six-cell Peltier constant-temperature accessory. Kinetic data for all other substrates were acquired using protocols identical to those reported earlier (10). MichaelisMenten parameters were calculated using a standard nonlinear least-squares fit of the rate versus substrate concentration data. To measure the binding affinity of DANA for Y370G, the rate of hydrolysis of MU-RNeuAc at a concentration well below Km was monitored in the presence of varying DANA concentrations. To obtain a value for Ki, the kinetic data were fit to the standard equation for competitive

To determine whether these catalyzed reactions give DANA as either a product or an intermediate, the Y370G mutant was incubated in the presence of DANA for 20 h. Under these conditions, no formation of N-acetylneuraminic acid was observed, yet DANA binds to this enzyme with a Ki value of (5.5 ( 1.8) × 10-6 M. Assuming that 10% hydration would have been detected, the maximal value for kcat for hydration of DANA by Y370G is 0.09 s-1. In addition, during the Y370G mutant-catalyzed hydrolysis of PNP-RNeu5Ac (1a), the only reaction product formed is N-acetylneuraminic acid (data not shown); that is, no evidence was seen for the formation of DANA. Thus, it can be concluded that the Y370G mutant catalyzes a substitution reaction and not an elimination reaction. Structural Studies. In 2003, Watson et al. (10) noted that mutation of the conserved catalytic tyrosine residue to a smaller amino acid (A, D, or G) resulted in a change in the mechanism from retention to inversion of configuration. The authors proposed that the mutation created a "hole" in the active site from which a bound water molecule could effectively function as the catalytic nucleophile. To investigate the structural consequences of such nonconservative mutations, the Y370G mutant described in the 2003 paper was crystallized and soaked with DHP-RNeu5Ac (as described in Experimental Procedures). The result of this experiment revealed unambiguous density for -Neu5Ac (4) sitting in the active site (Figure 2). Clearly, DHP-RNeu5Ac either was turned over slowly by the Y370G mutant or underwent partial spontaneous hydrolysis during the soaking experiment to give some Neu5Ac, which forms a mixed population of the R- and -anomers in solution. The overall structure of the Y370G active site is very similar to the previously reported wild-type structure (PDB entry 1EUS) (30), with an rmsd of only 0.36 Å for the 359 equivalent CR atoms that make up the -propeller catalytic domain. However, removal of the tyrosine residue creates

two very significant changes to the active site. The first is the creation of a large cavity in which the O2 atom of -Neu5Ac and four water molecules are seen forming hydrogen bond interactions with each other and with protein residues (Table 4). The second is the movement of the side chain of Asn310 to make a strong hydrogen bond to one of these waters at a distance of 2.70 Å. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the hole created by the Y370G mutation and the hydrogen bonding interactions in this area of the active site, respectively. DISCUSSION In 2003, Watson et al. (10) reported that three mutants with the strictly conserved tyrosine residue in the sialidase from M. Viridifaciens replaced are catalytically active inverting sialidases. On the basis of the results for the Y370D mutant, which included a pH-rate profile, a product study, and the effect of leaving group ability on the catalytic rate constants, Watson et al. (10) concluded that the Y370D mutant likely operates via a dissociative mechanism. Furthermore, these authors concluded that removal of the strictly conserved tyrosine residue, the catalytic nucleophile, resulted in the generation of a hole in which water could bind and then act as a nucleophile during the catalytic cycle. To probe in more detail whether such catalytically active inverting mutant sialidases operate via an associative or

dissociative mechanism, kinetic studies were performed using the Y370G mutant and sialoside substrates that possess two different leaving group chemistries. That is, kinetics were measured using 4-nitrophenyl sialoside and a sialosyl pyridinium substrate (PNP-RNeu5Ac and DHP-RNeu5Ac, respectively). The difference between these two classes of sialosides is that the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the pyridinium substrate (3) can be accelerated by nucleophilic catalysis, but not by acid catalysis, whereas hydrolysis of the aryl substrate (1a) can, in principle, be expedited by both types of catalysis. The catalytic proficiencies (CPs) listed in Table 3 show that mutation of the general acid catalyst (D92G mutant) actually increases the CP value for hydrolysis of 3, while the CP value for hydrolysis of 1a is decreased slightly. These observations are consistent with the notion that acid catalysis is either unimportant (PNP-RNeu5Ac) or impossible (DHPRNeu5Ac) during hydrolysis of these non-natural substrates. In contrast, removal of the nucleophilic tyrosine residue (Y370G mutant) results in a catastrophic loss of catalytic activity for hydrolysis of the substrate in which acid catalysis is impossible (3), yet efficient hydrolysis of 1a still occurs with the Y370G mutant enzyme. Given that DANA is neither a product nor an intermediate in these reactions, it can be inferred that hydrolysis proceeds via a direct substitution mechanism (SN1 or SN2). Consistent with the observations noted above is the conclusion that the wild-type and Y370G mutant enzymes catalyze reaction via SN2 and SN1 mechanisms, respectively. In other words, wild-type enzyme-catalyzed cleavage of the glycosidic C-N bond in 3, a compound in which acid catalysis is prohibited, is greatly accelerated by the correct alignment of a suitable nucleophile that is actively participating in the cleavage reaction, i.e., an associative SN2-type mechanism, whereas in the case of the Y370G inverting mutant, the nucleophilic water does not assist in departure of the pyridine leaving group even though the conserved glutamic acid residue (E260), which in the wild-type enzyme presumably acts as a general base catalyst, is still correctly positioned. In other words, the Y370G mutant-catalyzed reaction involves a dissociative SN1-type mechanism; that is, nucleophilic attack is not coupled to aglycon departure. Clearly, during hydrolysis of aryl sialosides, acid catalysis is a more important contributor to the observed rate acceleration (CP) for the Y370G mutant than it is for the wildtype enzyme. This strong kinetic evidence that the wild-type M. Viridifaciens sialidase operates via a mechanism in which nucleophilic attack is concerted with leaving group departure is in

The hole generated by the mutation can be seen directly beneath the O2 atom of the ligand. The water molecules are shown as magenta colored spheres, with selected hydrogen bonds as dashed green lines.

FIGURE 4: Stereoview of the active site of the MvNA Y370G mutant. The mutant active site is colored wheat, and the position of Asn310 in the wild-type structure (PDB entry 1EUS) is colored slate. The selected hydrogen bonds to the O2 atom of the ligand, -Neu5Ac, are shown as dashed green lines. Four water molecules (magenta) can be seen sitting in the hole generated by the absence of Tyr370. The movement of Asn310 in the mutant structure can also clearly be seen to make a new hydrogen bond to one of these water molecules.

agreement with the conclusion made by Yang et al. (31), based on anomeric 13C kinetic isotope effects, that the mechanism used by the trans-sialidase from T. cruzi is SN2 in nature. The conclusion that the Y370G mutant operates via an SN1 mechanism in which C-O bond cleavage is ratedetermining is further strengthened by an analysis of the effect of leaving group ability on the kinetic rate parameters. The lg value for the SN1-like uncatalyzed spontaneous hydrolysis of aryl sialosides is -1.22 (32), a value that is only slightly larger than those calculated for the Y370G mutant-catalyzed reactions (Figure 1). It can therefore be concluded that the bound water molecule can only weakly assist leaving group departure, at best. Of note, the Y370G mutant possesses kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of 3-sialyllactose (2) that are within 1 order of magnitude of those reported for the Y370D mutant (10). Therefore, it can be concluded that the Y370D mutant also reacts via a dissociative (SN1-like) mechanism. Of note, the M. Viridifaciens sialidase efficiently processes a broad range of substrate structures. Specifically, the CP for the hydrolysis of 3 (Table 3) is between 60- and 1200fold greater than those reported for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of pyridinium R-D-N-acetylneuraminide by a series of bacterial and viral sialidases (33).

The structure of the Y370G complex with the first-formed product of the enzymatic reaction, i.e., -NeuAc, neatly demonstrates the source of the attacking water from the hole generated by the absence of the phenol ring of Tyr370 (Figure 3). Furthermore, analysis of the hydrogen bond interactions (Table 4), which shows the conserved active site general base (Glu260) to be only 2.71 Å from O2 and 2.7 Å from one of these water molecules, raises the possibility that strong H-bonding to this residue maintains a sufficient distance between the critical water molecule and the anomeric center to prevent nucleophilic attack until after formation of the oxacarbenium ion (SN1). In other words, nucleophilic attack is delayed until the growing cation-lone pair interaction between the nascent cationic center and the water molecule overcomes the H-bonding to the glutamate residue, whereas in the wild-type MvNA, the nucleophilic oxygen atom (Tyr370) is held in an optimal position such that nucleophilic attack occurs prior to the complete buildup of positive charge on the anomeric center (SN2). CONCLUSIONS In summary, kinetic studies are consistent with the conclusion that the wild-type sialidase from M. Viridifaciens catalyzes hydrolysis with a direct nucleophilic attack of the active site tyrosine residue at the anomeric center, whereas

9122 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 25, 2005 the nucleophilic mutant (Y370G) operates via a dissociative mechanism in which a bound water molecule attacks the nascent oxacarbenium ion center after leaving group departure to give -NeuAc as the first-formed product. The threedimensional structure of the Y370G mutant shows that removal of the nucleophilic tyrosine residue generates a hole in which water is bound and that minor modifications to the surrounding residues occur to facilitate hydrogen bonding to these water molecules.
