Abstract The tRNA modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is involved in the exchange of guanine in the first position of the anticodon with preQ1 as part of the biosynthesis of the hypermodified base queuine (Q). Mutation of Ser90 to an alanine in Escherichia coli TGT leads to a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity (Reuter, K. et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 7041^7046). To further clarify the role of this residue in the catalytic center, we have mutated the corresponding Ser103 of the crystallizable Zymomonas mobilis TGT into alanine. The crystal structure of a TGT(S103A)/preQ1 complex combined with biochemical data presented in this paper suggest that Ser103 is essential for substrate orientation in the TGT reaction. z 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Key words: Queuine; Modi¢ed nucleoside; tRNA; Crystal structure; Catalytic mechanism 1. Introduction Eubacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT, EC 2.4.2.29) [1] catalyzes the ¢rst step of the posttranscriptional modi¢cation in the anticodon loop of cognate tRNAs (Asn, Asp, His, Tyr), resulting in the exchange of guanine-34 at the wobble position by the queuine precursor 7-aminomethyl-7deazaguanine (preQ1 ). This precursor is converted to the hypermodi¢ed base queuine (Q-base: 7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclo-penten-3-ylamino-methyl)-7-deazaguanine) in subsequent enzymatic steps [2]. Queuine is found at the wobble position of tRNAs in most organisms with the exception of yeast and archaebacteria [3^5]. In eukaryotes, the Q-base is a nutrient and the replacement of guanine-34 with queuine is carried out directly in one single enzymatic step [6]. The exact biological function of queuine in tRNA is not yet fully understood, but it seems to play a role in the ¢ne tuning of protein biosynthesis in eubacteria [7] and in di¡erent cellular events such as development, di¡erentiation, aging and cancer in eukaryotes [8,9]. In Shigellae, which are the causative agents of dysentery and e¡ect some 500 000 infant deaths per year, the enzymatic activity of TGT is a prerequisite for pathogenicity [10]. This prompted us to launch a detailed biochemical and structural study of this enzyme, since it might be a useful target for the design of a drug against Shigellosis.

The structure of Zymomonas mobilis TGT has been solved î at 1.85 A resolution and revealed a non-canonical (L/K)8 -barrel fold with a zinc binding subdomain. Soaking of TGT î crystals with preQ1 and inspection of the structure at 2.2 A resolution indicated a speci¢c preQ1 binding pocket at the C-terminal face of the barrel [11]. Mutagenesis and crystallographic studies revealed Asp102 to be the active site nucleophile of Z. mobilis TGT in the base exchange reaction. The proposed mechanism involves two consecutive SN 2 reactions and the formation of a covalent TGT/tRNA intermediate [12]. An Escherichia coli mutant has been described that contains tRNAs lacking queuine due to a single point mutation in the tgt gene changing the Ser90 codon (E. coli numbering) to a Phe codon [13]. Mutation of Ser90 to cysteine leads to a reduced activity of E. coli TGT, mainly due to an increased KM for the substrate tRNA. The mutation of Ser90 to alanine leads to a dramatic decrease of catalytic e¤ciency, such that Vmax /KM is reduced by four orders of magnitude compared to the wild-type [14]. The E. coli and Z. mobilis TGT show 53% sequence identity and have similar kinetic parameters. Inspection of the crystal structure of the Z. mobilis TGT in complex with preQ1 suggested that Ser103 (which corresponds to Ser90 in E. coli) is involved in substrate orientation. In the preQ1 î complex, this residue forms a weak hydrogen bond (3.5 A) to the 2-NH2 group of preQ1 . Assuming that G34 of the tRNA occupies the preQ1 site during the ¢rst step of catalysis, Ser103 cannot act as the catalytic nucleophile due to the long distance î of 7 A to nitrogen N9 in preQ1 [11] and by implication to the 1P carbon of the G34 ribose. Although it does not appear to be directly involved in catalysis, the importance of this residue is emphasized by the fact that it seems to be invariant among all suggested and characterized TGT enzymes. This fact is true even for TGT enzymes from archaebacteria and eukaryotes, which exhibit deviating substrate speci¢cities from eubacterial TGTs [15]. To further elucidate the function of this residue in the catalytic center of TGT, we have mutated Ser103 of Z. mobilis TGT to alanine in order to determine the crystal structure of the mutated protein. Here we report the biochemical and structural characterization of the Z. mobilis TGT(S103A). 2. Materials and methods

TGT and E. coli tRNATyr preparation Z mobilis TGT, both wild-type and S103A mutant, were prepared as described previously [16,20] and stored at 4³C as microcrystalline suspension. Prior to use, a small sample of the microcrystals was redissolved in a high-salt bu¡er composed of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2 and an appropriate concentration of NaCl. The NaCl concentration was adjusted to the lowest possible value to obtain a total dissolution of the microcrystals (e.g. 400 mM NaCl lead to a TGT concentration of 1 mg/ml, 2 M NaCl lead to a maximum TGT concentration of 12 mg/ml). E. coli tRNATyr -(G34) was prepared as described previously [14] and stored at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in a bu¡er composed of 5 mM cacodylate (pH 6.5), 2 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM EDTA. 2.2. Construction of the TGT mutant S103A The construction of the mutant was performed via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on a protocol already described [17,18]. The PCR-primers were partially overlapping with both of them containing the mutated codon (Table 1). Successful mutagenesis was veri¢ed by sequence analysis of the complete mutated tgt gene using an ABI-PRISM 310 automated sequencer, allowing the identi¢cation of clones with no additional undesired mutations. 2.3. Activity assays The determinations of wild-type TGT and TGT(S103A) activities were performed as described previously [16]. 2.4. Band-shift assay Wild-type or mutated TGT (3 WM) was ¢rst incubated with a 20-fold excess of E. coli tRNATyr at 37³C for 1 h in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 20 mM MgCl2 . The reaction mixtures were then analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described previously [12]. Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Merck) followed by silver staining (Sigma). 2.5. Crystallization and preQ1 soaking PreQ1 was synthesized as described previously [19]. Wild-type TGT and TGT(S103A) were crystallized as described previously [20]. Crystals were soaked for 3 days at 22³C in a bu¡er composed of 5% (w/v) PEG 8000, 10% (v/v) DMSO, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 1 mM DTT and 50 mM preQ1 . 2.6. Structure determination X-ray data were collected on an RAXIS-IV image plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode generator operating at î 50 kV and 100 mA, using focusing mirrors (MSC, USA). The crystal to detector distance was 120 mm and images of 1³ oscillation with a 5 min exposure time were collected at 3173³C. Di¡raction data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [21]. To collect data under cryo-conditions crystals were £ash frozen in a solution containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 16% (w/v) PEG 8000 and 20% (v/v) glycerol as a cryo-protectant. The structures were re¢ned by several cycles of energy minimization, using X-PLOR [22] and manual correction using ARP [23] and O [24].

To verify successful mutagenesis and exclude potential additional mutations, the complete insert of the mutated plasmid was sequenced. The resulting plasmid pETZM4-S103A was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for overexpression of the mutated tgt gene as described previously [16]. TGT(S103A) could be puri¢ed identically to the wild-type TGT, indicating a correct folding of the enzyme. 3.2. Characterization of the TGT(S103A) mutation by activity assay and denaturing gel electrophoresis The measurement of TGT(S103A) activity revealed a drastic reduction of activity compared with wild-type Z. mobilis TGT as positive control. Even at high substrate and enzyme concentrations the initial velocities were too low to determine Vmax and KM because of the pronounced errors obtained for the measured values. This ¢nding was consistent with the properties of E. coli TGT(S90A) [14]. It has been shown that E. coli TGT(S90A) binds cognate tRNA under native conditions [14]. To see if Z. mobilis TGT(S103A) retained

the ability to form the covalent protein/tRNA intermediate shown for wild-type TGT, we performed a band-shift experiment under denaturing conditions as described previously [12] using wild-type TGT as positive control. Both wild-type and mutated TGT were incubated at 37³C for 1 h in the presence and absence of a 20-fold excess of E. coli tRNATyr -(G34). Analysis by SDS-PAGE clearly showed the presence of shifted bands (V66 kDa) consistent with a TGT monomerWtRNA complex (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, an additional band at a higher

molecular weight (V97 kDa) was observed in the case of TGT(S103A) seen also for Z. mobilis TGT(D156A) [12], for which no explanation can be given. Nevertheless, the results con¢rm that TGT(S103A) is able to form a covalent intermediate with the tRNA and that Ser103 cannot be the active site nucleophile involved in the formation of a covalent bond to tRNA. Consistent with these results, we also ¢nd that the

Subsequent nucleophilic substitution by the deprotonated preQ1 molecule preserves the L-con¢guration and leads to the modi¢ed preQ1 -tRNA. The residue Ser103 performs a critical role in substrate orientation.

E. coli TGT(S90A) mutant forms a covalent complex with both full-length tRNA and minihelix RNA (data not shown). 3.3. Structural characterization Soaking crystals of TGT(S103A) with preQ1 and subsequent structure analysis was used to determine the binding mode of the substrate. The X-ray structure has been solved î at 2.0 A resolution (Table 2) and shows only minor changes compared to the wild-type structure (Fig. 2). The serine to alanine mutation is clearly con¢rmed by the electron density map. A preQ1 molecule could easily be ¢t in the di¡erence electron density. The 2fo 3fc electron density map of the re¢ned TGT(S103A) structure including the substrate clearly indicates a similar orientation of the preQ1 molecule as observed in the wild-type structure [11]. The base is intercalated between the side chains of Met260 on one side, and Tyr106 and Cys158 on the other side. Speci¢c recognition is allowed through hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Asp156 and the 1-NH and 2-NH2 groups, and between the amide of Gly230 and oxygen O6. These residues are strictly conserved in all presently known TGT sequences of prokaryotes, archaebacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting a common guanine recognition motif [15]. Interestingly, di¡erence electron density indicates a rotation of the exocyclic methylene-amino group of preQ1 by V95³ in the TGT(S103A) complex, allowing an interaction with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Leu231 (Fig. 2). The 2-NH2 group of preQ1 forms a hydrogen bond î (2.8 A) to an additional water molecule in the vicinity of the serine to alanine mutation. This water molecule is not present in the wild-type structure, and thus formally replaces the OH functional group of Ser103 . In the wild-type TGT/preQ1 complex, the 2-NH2 group is involved in a weak hydrogen bond î (3.5 A) to Ser103 , suggesting that this residue assists in the correct orientation of the substrate required for the base exchange reaction [11]. In the present complex, no electron density was observed for the C2-NH2 group of preQ1 in the 2fo 3fc map at a contour level of 1.0 c (Fig. 3), nor could electron density be properly assigned to the hydroxyphenyl ring of Tyr106 , indicating that this residue is not fully occupied in the position adjacent to the preQ1 molecule (Fig. 3). A superposition based on all main chain atoms between wildtype TGT and TGT(S103A) shows a slight rotation of the preQ1 molecule towards the amide group of Gly230 (Fig. 2). 4. Discussion The results presented here support the catalytic mechanism proposed on the basis of structural and mutagenesis studies described previously [11,12]. The X-ray structure of queuosine monophosphate shows that the L-con¢guration of the ribose is preserved [25]. Consequently, two consecutive SN 2 reactions are most likely involved in the base exchange reaction catalyzed by TGT as indicated earlier [11,12]. In this mechanism, a covalent TGT/tRNA intermediate is formed as a consequence of the preceding nucleophilic attack by the carboxylate of Asp102 at the C1P atom of the wobble guanosine (Fig. 4). After replacement of guanine by preQ1 at the binding site, the deprotonated preQ1 attacks carbon C1P of the ribose, resulting in the ¢nal preQ1 -modi¢ed tRNA. In our band-shift experiment, we have demonstrated that TGT(S103A) still binds covalently to tRNA, in agreement with the above postulated mechanism. Therefore, residue Ser103 cannot be involved in

the nucleophilic attack of the wobble guanosine. In the enzyme assay, we observed a dramatic reduction of activity of Z. mobilis TGT(S103A) compared to the wild-type TGT. However, total inactivation upon mutation of the Z. mobilis TGT Ser103 to alanine could not be determined, consistent with the results obtained for E. coli TGT(S90A) [14]. The X-ray structure of Z. mobilis TGT(S103A) showed di¡erence density for a preQ1 molecule, suggesting a similar binding mode to that observed for wild-type TGT. This clearly implies that the wobble guanine is still recognized in the preQ1 binding pocket of TGT(S103A). However, the lack of well resolved electron density attributable to the C2-NH2 group of preQ1 and to the side chain of Tyr106 in the re¢ned structure of TGT(S103A) indicates an elevated £exibility of the preQ1 molecule in the binding pocket. In the wild-type TGT, the 2-NH2 group of preQ1 forms a weak hydrogen bond (3.5 î A) to Ser103 [11]. This interaction could be crucial for immobilizing the wobble guanosine in a binding position suitable for the nucleophilic attack and tighter binding of the intermediate transition state with Asp102 (Fig. 4). Removal of the Ser103 hydroxyl group by an alanine replacement is accompanied by a change to a more hydrophobic environment. In the re¢ned TGT(S103A) structure, an additional water molecule is detected in the vicinity of Ala103 , allowing for an extra î hydrogen bond (2.8 A) to the 2-NH2 group of preQ1 . This water molecule could mimic the Ser-OH recognition site, however it obviously does not retain the orientational ¢xation of the Ser103 hydroxyl group binding to the 2-NH2 group of the wobble guanosine. We therefore conclude that Ser103 plays a critical role in the appropriate immobilization and orientation of the substrate for the base exchange reaction.
