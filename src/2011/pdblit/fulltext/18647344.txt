Bacterial l-asparaginases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of l-asparagine to aspartic acid. For the past 30 years, these enzymes have been used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acute childhood lymphoblastic leukemia. Their intrinsic low-rate glutaminase activity, however, causes serious side-effects, including neurotoxicity, hepatitis, coagulopathy, and other dysfunctions. Erwinia carotovora asparaginase shows decreased glutaminase activity, so it is believed to have fewer sideeffects in leukemia therapy. To gain detailed insights into the properties of E. carotovora asparaginase, combined crystallographic, thermal stability and cytotoxic experiments were performed. The crystal structure of E. carotovora l-asparaginase in the presence of l-Asp was determined at ° 2.5 A resolution and refined to an Rcryst of 19.2 (Rfree = 26.6%) with good stereochemistry. Cytotoxicity measurements revealed that E. carotovora asparaginase is 30 times less toxic than the Escherichia coli enzyme against human leukemia cell lines. Moreover, denaturing experiments showed that E. carotovora asparaginase has decreased thermodynamic stability as compared to the E. coli enzyme and is rapidly inactivated in the presence of urea. On the basis of these results, we propose that E. carotovora asparaginase has limited potential as an antileukemic drug, despite its promising low glutaminase activity. Our analysis may be applicable to the therapeutic evaluation of other asparaginases as well.

l-Asparaginases (EC 3.5.1.1) are enzymes that primarily catalyze the conversion of l-asparagine to l-Asn and ammonia, and to a lesser extent the hydrolysis of l-Gln to l-Glu. Two types of bacterial l-asparaginase have been identified, namely type I and type II [1]. Type I asparaginases are expressed constitutively in the cytoplasm and characterized by enzymatic activity for both l-Asn and l-Gln. Type II asparaginases are expressed under anaerobic conditions in the periplasmic space of the bacterial membranes and display high specific activity against l-Asn. Type II asparaginases, in particular, display antitumor activity and are

used as chemotherapeutics in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [2­4]. The antileukemic effect of l-asparaginases is believed to result from the depletion of circulating Asn. Certain tumors have decreased or absent activity of Asn synthase, so they are dependent on externally supplied l-Asn for growth [5]. Following administration of l-asparaginase, the Asn blood levels are reduced, leading to selectively induced inhibition and regression of tumors. A marked reduction of l-Asn concentration in blood and tissue fluids (< 10% of the normal level) is required for effective treatment.

Erwinia carotovora L-asparaginase

Escherichia coli periplasmic l-asparaginase (EcAII) and Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase (ErA) have been successfully used in leukemia treatment. However, their l-glutaminase side activity limits their use and causes severe side-effects as a result of l-Gln deprivation [6]. Serious liver disorders, acute pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, immunosuppression and other dysfunctions are some of the side-effects in patients receiving l-asparaginase treatment. Also, differences between E. coli and Er. chrysanthemi asparaginase in respect to toxicity and efficacy have been found [2]. All known bacterial l-asparaginases show high similarity in their tertiary and quaternary structures. l-Asparaginases crystallize mostly as homotetramers with 222 symmetry. Structural information on several l-asparaginases, including EcAII [7], ErA [8], Wolinella succinogenes asparaginase [9] and related amidohydrolases from Acinetobacter glutaminasificans [10] and Pseudomonas fluorescence [11], is available. Recently, an X-ray structure of ErA was refined to ° 1.0 A resolution [12]. The enzyme monomer consists of $ 330 amino acids arranged in two domains. The active site of l-asparaginase is located between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of two adjacent monomers. Residues responsible for ligand binding form the rigid part of the active site. The flexible part of the active site (residues 14­33 in ErA) controls access to the binding pocket and carries the catalytic nucleophile Thr15, which is highly conserved for all l-asparaginases [8]. This region is often disordered in the crystals of the enzyme, indicating high mobility of the flexible loop. Suicide inhibitors bind covalently to the primary catalytic nucleophile Thr15 and Tyr29 of ErA, freezing the flexible loop in the `closed' conformation [13]. Further experiments have shown that, indeed, substrate binding induces rapid closure of the loop, whereas in the absence of ligands, the loop stays predominantly open [14,15]. Desired properties for therapeutic l-asparaginases include high l-asparaginase activity, low l-glutaminase specificity, and a long half-time in the bloodstream [16]. These criteria have directed the search for an optimal therapeutic asparaginase that started more than 30 years ago [17] but has not led to any noticeable success. As a result, many asparaginases with promising catalytic properties did not pass preclinical trials, because of their therapeutic inefficiency [18]. In most of the studies, the catalytic properties of the enzymes were characterized in detail, but other important parameters, such as oligomerization and thermal stability, were overlooked. Hence, a clear understanding of the catalytic activity, conformational stability and structural properties is required to pro-

vide adequate and efficient criteria for evaluation and prognosis of the therapeutic efficiency of new l-asparaginases. Recent studies have shown that Erwinia carotovora asparaginase (EwA), similarly to EcAII, exhibits a very low glutaminase activity ­ about 1.5% of its l-asparaginase activity [19,20]. On the other hand, ErA, which is more closely related to EwA at the amino acid sequence level than to EcAII, has a glutaminase activity that is approximately 10% of its asparaginase activity but is better for medication, owing to less severe immunorelated side-effects [21,22]. Consequently, EwA may exhibit better therapeutic potential by combining the advantages of both EcAII and ErA. To gain further insights into EwA and to assess its suitability as a drug candidate, we have determined the crystal structure of the enzyme in the presence of Asp and carried out stability and cytotoxicity measurements. Unlike in previously reported crystal structures of asparaginases, a dimer of homotetramers was found in the crystals. As compared to EcAII, EwA was found to have reduced stability with and without l-Asp. Furthermore, its cytotoxic efficiency was 30 times lower than that of EcAII.

Results and Discussion
Quality of the structure The structure of EwA was refined to an Rcryst of 19.2% (Rfree = 26.6%). The final model consists of eight monomers, eight l-Asp molecules, and a total of 708 water molecules. The first three residues and a gap between residues 19 and 33 could not be fully modeled in any of the eight individual monomers, due to the lack of sufficient electron density. The Ramachandran plot showed 89.2% of the non-Gly and non-Pro residues in the most preferable region and 0.4% in the generously allowed region. The overall G-factor is )0.05, which is better than expected for structures determined at the same resolution according to procheck. The average B-factor for all atoms in the ° structure is 34.6 A2, close to the B-factor of the col° lected dataset calculated by Wilson plot (39.6 A2). The ° average B-factors for each monomer are: A, 29.6 A2; ° ° ° ° B, 29.0 A2; C, 30.2 A2; D, 28.7 A2; E, 39.4 A2; ° ° ° F, 39.3 A2; G, 39.5 A2; and H, 39.8 A2. The map correlation is 0.95 (Fig. S1). Overall structure The eight monomers (indexed from A to H) are arranged in two tetramers (ABCD and EFGH) in the

the overall fold and active site orientation. One structurally important difference found between EwA and EcAII is the presence of a single disulfide bond in EcAII, involving Cys77 and Cys105. This disulfide bond is placed near the substrate entry, possibly providing extra stabilization to EcAII. Hence, site-directed mutagenesis to engineer a similar disulfide bond into EwA may alter the properties of the enzyme and improve its stability. Active site The catalytic site of the enzyme is located between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of adjacent monomers (A and C; B and D). Sequence comparison indicates that the active site is highly conserved between EwA, ErA, and EcAII (Fig. 2A). Strong electron density in the active site region was found and, due to its shape, it was assigned to a bound l-Asp. The low ° B-factors, around 30 A2, for the active site residues in monomer A indicated that there is relatively stable binding of the ligand, as also suggested by the B-factor ° (36.1 A2) of l-Asp itself. Higher B-factors for l-Asp were found in other monomers, possibly due to less tight binding. The catalytic residues are believed to be Thr15 and Thr95 according to previous structures of l-asparaginases. Thr15 is part of the active site flexible loop comprising residues 14­33. Evaluation of contacts within the structure shows that the surrounding residues Ser62, Glu63, Asp96 and Ala120 also have significant contacts with the ligand (Table 1). Ala120, ° in particular, is approximately 0.3 A closer to the OD2 of l-Asp, and it may provide additional stabilization for ligand binding (Fig. 3). Hence, a bulkier residue could further reduce the size of the binding pocket, possibly leading to an additional reduction of the glutaminase activity. In EcAII, Glu283 from monomer C is involved in a strong hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of l-Asp. In contrast, only Ser254 OG from monomer C of the AC EwA dimer makes a weak con° tact (4.25 A) with the nitrogen atom of l-Asp, and no structural equivalent of EcAII Glu283 is found in EwA and ErA, due to a deletion in their primary structure (Fig. 2A). This might explain the higher affinity of EcAII for l-Asn (Km = 15 lm) [15] as compared with EwA (Km = 98 lm) [19] or ErA (Km = 55 lm) [24]. Close inspection of this region in the crystal structures of EwA and EcAII reveals that ° Asp287 of EwA monomer C is approximately 5.8 A away from EcAII Glu283 and hence unable to make any contacts with l-Asp. Structural comparison with the active site of ErA shows strong conservation of the participating residues. One notable exception is EwA

asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). The rmsd values between ° the monomers are no higher than 0.29 A (monomer A will be taken as reference unless otherwise stated). Each of the independent monomers has the characteristic two-domain architecture of l-asparaginases: a large N-terminal domain characterized by an eightstranded antiparallel mixed b-sheet, and a smaller C-terminal domain that contains a parallel b-sheet (Fig. 1B) [23]. The two domains are connected by an approximately 20 residue flexible linker in the region around residue 200. Of all residues in the linker, Thr204 adopts a stereochemistry that lies in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, in agreement with the corresponding Thr in EcAII and ErA. Comparison with other asparaginase monomers Structure-based sequence alignment was carried out against EcAII and ErA monomers using the coordinates of the 3ECA [7] and 1HG1 [8] Protein Data ° Bank entries, respectively (Fig. 2). An rmsd of 0.42 A ° (49% sequence (78% sequence identity) and 0.88 A identity) for Ca atoms was found for ErA and EcAII, respectively. The symmetry found in EwA tetramers matches that of EcAII and ErA, and the overall fold of the monomers is also identical (Fig. 2B). As expected, EwA and ErA keep a nearly identical fold, whereas there are more differences between EwA and EcAII. The largest differences are found in the flexible parts of the surface, but these are less important for

Gly61, which corresponds to Ala61 in ErA. Given that EcAII has also a Gly in the same position, the presence of Ala in ErA may contribute to the increased glutaminase activity of the latter as compared to EwA and EcAII, because of small conformational changes or different flexibility of the surrounding residues. Different conformations of the active site flexible loop may also contribute to the variations in substrate specificity among l-asparaginases [20]. Hence, the active site flexible loop could be another good starting point for protein engineering efforts to produce l-asparaginase variants with altered substrate specificity. The EwA tetramer As the tetramer is known to be the catalytically active form of asparaginases [25], its preservation is important for the enzymatic and, consequently, therapeutic

properties of the enzyme. Spatial and energetic properties of monomer interfaces in EwA and EcAII tetramers are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The largest contact area is between monomers A and C, which participate in the active site formation. This interface corresponds to 24­28% of the dimer solventaccessible surface area (ASA). The asparaginase monomers that do not contribute to the catalytic center formation are less tightly bound. Their pairwise contact area involves no more than 10­12% of the dimer ASA. The strength of the intersubunit binding correlates well with the interaction energy, which is also significantly higher for the AC dimers than for other dimer combinations. The comparison of EwA crystal structures in complex with l-Asp in the active site and in the absence of any ligand (Protein Data Bank code 1ZCF) reveals that l-Asp binding tightens the interaction of each monomer; for example, the

number of hydrogen bonds increases and the electrostatic part of the interaction energy is reduced to half, with the exception of the EwA AD dimer. This finding implies that the thermodynamic stability of asparaginase in solution will benefit from the presence of l-Asp. Although EcAII and EwA do not differ significantly with respect to the geometry of the dimer interface, EwA is characterized by a considerably higher electrostatic energy of monomer­monomer interactions. Although the electrostatic energy is decreased upon binding of l-Asp to EwA, it still remains approxi4310

mately three times higher than that of the corresponding EcAII monomer pairs. This observation suggests reduced thermodynamic stability of EwA and, consequently, a possible decreased ability of this enzyme to inhibit tumor cell growth. The hydrophobic interactions were not taken into consideration, although they are very important in evaluating the stability of protein­protein complexes. However, the calculation of the hydrophobic constituent in a vacuum using crystal structure is not accurate, as it essentially depends on the protein environment.

Crystal packing in the asymmetric unit EwA was found to form a dimer of homotetramers in the asymmetric unit. The intermolecular interactions between the two tetramers are mediated mainly by salt bridges found between B Asp215 and G Arg148, B Asp215 and G Lys147, and C Arg148 and F Asp215. Calculation of the ASA between the two EwA tetramers ° gives an estimated contact area of $ 3700 A2, which is ° in the upper range of contact areas (> 2000 A2) found in protein­protein complexes [26]. The shape complementarity Sc [27] of the two tetramers is 0.517, which corresponds to the lower limit of Sc found in protein­ protein interfaces. Thus, the possibility that EwA may be able to form higher-order oligomers under physiological conditions cannot be ruled out according to structural considerations. Changes in the oligomeric form of l-asparaginase could be clinically important and may require further investigation. Earlier studies have shown that EcAII is able to form oligomers of different molecular masses, depending on the enzyme concentration and the influence of various chemicals [28]. Cytotoxicity tests EwA showed an inhibitory effect on leukemia cell growth (Fig. 4). Three human tumor cell lines commonly used to test asparaginase cytotoxicity were employed. The enzyme concentrations used in the

experiments (from 0.01 to 15 IUÆmL)1) covered the range of asparaginase concentration in blood after injection of a standard dose of this drug (0.5­ 2 IUÆmL)1) [29]. The viabilities of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma cells were significantly decreased after 72 h of incubation with EwA. Chronic myeloid leukemia cells were rather resistant to asparaginase treatment [18]. A significant decrease in cell viability began at an EwA concentration of 0.5 IUÆmL)1 for K562 and MOLT-4 cells, and at 0.3 IUÆmL)1 for Raji cells, and this was followed by a further linear decay of the number of surviving cells up to 0% of control. The LC50 values were determined to be 3.26 ± 0.29 and 7.33 ± 0.42 IUÆmL)1 for Raji and MOLT-4 cells, respectively. For K562 cells, the LC50 value was not determined, as a 50% decrease in the number of viable cells was not reached even with the highest concentration of 15 IUÆmL)1 used in the experiment. The concentration of 5 IUÆmL)1 marked a plateau on the dose-dependence curve, suggesting that the LC50 level may not be reached at all for K562 cells. Similar results were obtained with EcAII, which was used as a reference enzyme. Only a quantitative difference between EcAII and EwA antiproliferative properties was found. The EcAII LC50 values for both Raji (0.11 ± 0.005 IUÆmL)1) and MOLT-4 (0.27 ± 0.03 IUÆmL)1) cells were approximately 30 times lower than the EwA LC50 value, suggesting that EcAII is $ 30 times more toxic than EwA.

Stability measurements Comparative studies of thermodynamic stabilities revealed that EwA, in contrast to EcAII, rapidly lost its
4312

activity under denaturating conditions (Fig. 5). Incubation for 3 min at 35 °C led to a 60% irreversible decrease of EwA activity, whereas EcAII retained most of its initial activity after incubation under the same conditions. EwA also displayed low stability in urea solutions (Fig. 5B), and its enzymatic activity was completely lost after 1 h of incubation with 2 m urea. In contrast, no decrease in activity was observed for EcAII with up to 4 m urea. Furthermore, the presence of l-Asp increased the stability of both asparaginases with respect to the denaturing effect of temperature and urea, in agreement with the structural analysis of the tetramer. Thus, the stability of EwA remained much lower than that of EcAII even in the presence of l-Asp. With all of these findings, the drastic difference between the cytotoxic activities of EcAII and EwA may be attributed to the ability of these asparaginases to maintain their catalytically active oligomeric conformation. Indeed, the rapid loss of EwA activity

below 30­40 °C is due probably to disruption of the quaternary tetrameric structure rather than to the unfolding of individual monomers. The same is expected for asparaginase inactivation in urea solution. Shifrin et al. [25] have shown in sedimentation velocity experiments, confirmed by fluorescent studies, that the inactivation of asparaginase in urea proceeds through tetramer dissociation. Implications The results presented here have unveiled a potential correlation between the thermodynamic stability of EwA and its cytotoxicity. Thus, two important conclusions can be drawn from our studies. First, thermodynamic stability appears to provide a new criterion that has been previously overlooked during the search for new therapeutic candidates in the l-asparaginase family. Second, our analysis may help to interpret the variations in the clinical profiles of asparaginase therapy that so far are not fully understood. For example, the recently published results of a comparative study of therapeutic l-asparaginases conducted for 7 years by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute showed that ErA is less toxic and less efficacious than EcAII [30,31]. It is possible that ErA may dissociate rapidly and lose its activity after injection, so becoming unable to induce either a therapeutic effect or toxicity as compared to EcAII. This assumption agrees well with the essentially different half-times of these enzymes in blood (6­15 h for ErA and 30­34 h for EcAII) [18]. Further investigations are clearly necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the interplay of therapeutic potential and protein stability in l-asparaginases.

A600 nm = 0.8­0.9, and EwA expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside for 5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min and stored at )20 °C until use. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in water and disrupted by sonication. Then, the pH of the cell-free extract was decreased to 6.0 with 1 m NaH2PO4. Cell debris and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 20 min. The soluble fraction of the cell-free extract was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (1 · 8 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and unbound proteins were washed off with the same buffer. EwA was eluted with 100 mL of a 0­0.8 m NaCl linear gradient in column buffer, desalted on a PD10 column, and concentrated to 10 mgÆmL)1.

Crystallization and data collection
EwA was crystallized in the presence of l-Asp as previously described [32]. Briefly, a 10 mgÆmL)1 protein solution containing 10 mm l-Asp was mixed with a reservoir solution containing 16­18% poly(ethylene glycol) 4000 and 0.2 m NaF. Crystals usually appear after $ 5 days. Data were collected on station X13 at EMBL Hamburg (c / o DESY) from a single crystal at 100 K, using 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant. A MARCCD detector and a fixed wavelength ° (0.8043 A) were used during data collection. In total, 900 images with an oscillation range of 0.25° and exposure time $ 30 s were collected, processed and scaled using xds [33]. Details of data processing are given in Table 4.

Structure determination and refinement
Initial phases were calculated with phaser [34], using a poly-alanine model of ErA tetramer (Protein Data Bank code 1HG1). Refinement was first carried out with cns [35], and at the later stages with refmac5 [36]. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4. Rebuilding and manual fitting into 2|Fo|­|Fc| and |Fo|­|Fc| difference electron density maps were performed in o [37] and coot [38]. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used in the initial stages of refinement, and were gradually released at the final stages. Water molecules were added either manually or automatically by arp / warp [39]. Only water molecules ° with B-factors < 65 A2 after a round of refinement were kept for subsequent refinement. Bond distances and contacts were analyzed by the program contact from the ccp4i program suite [40]. The geometric quality of the refined model was assessed with procheck [41]. Monomer interfaces were analyzed by cache 6.1 (http://www.fqs.pl/ chemistry/cache), and interaction energies were calculated using swiss-pdbviewer 3.7 with the gromos96 forcefield (http://www.expasy.org/spdbv). Structure-based superposition was performed with ssm [42] and structural comparison between monomers with lsqkab [40].

Experimental procedures
Cloning, expression and purification of EwA
A plasmid pACY177 / ECAR-LANS containing a 1126 bp EwA genome fragment including the EwA gene (ansB1, Gene ID 2884179) was kindly provided by V. V. Bogush (Institute of Gene Biology, Moscow). EwA was PCR amplified from this plasmid using the following forward and reverse primers: 5¢-CGTCATATGAAAAGGATGTTTAA GG-3¢ and 5¢-CCTCTCGAGATAAGCGTGGAAGTAA TCC-3¢. The NdeI and XhoI sites (underlined) were introduced at the 5¢-terminus and the 3¢-terminus, respectively, of the EwA gene for cloning into the pET22b vector (Novagen). The resulting pET22 / EwA plasmid was inserted into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells after verification of construct fidelity by sequencing. Cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 lgÆmL)1 ampicillin at 37 °C to

in fresh medium. The range of the final l-asparaginase concentrations in each well was from 0.01 IUÆmL)1 to 15 IUÆmL)1. Each test was performed in triplicate. Commercially produced EcAII l-asparaginase (Medac, Hamburg, Germany) was used as a reference. After 72 h of incubation under standard conditions, a colorimetric assay using the metabolizable salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was employed to measure cell survival [44]. Two hours before the end of incubation, 50 lL of MTT (1 mgÆmL)1) in the culture medium were added to each well. After staining, the culture medium was removed, formazan crystals produced by reduction of MTT were dissolved in 100 lL of dimethylsulfoxide, and staining intensity was measured by absorption at 540 nm on an ELISA reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Cell survival (CS) was calculated by the equation: CS = (Dtreated well / mean Dcontrol wells) · 100%. The enzyme concentration lethal to 50% of cells (LC50) was calculated from the fit of experimental data to the dose­ response equation CSðEÞ ¼ A1 þ ðA2 À A1 Þ=½1 þ 10ðLC50 ÀEÞ p; where A1 and A2 are the bottom and top asymptotes, E the enzyme concentration, and p the Hill slope. Data were processed with origin 7.0 (http://www.originlab.com).

Conformational stability measurements
To test asparaginase thermal stability, 10 lL of enzyme stock solution (150 IUÆmL)1) were added to 500 lL of preheated 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), supplemented with 50 mm NaCl, mixed vigorously for a few seconds, and incubated at a given temperature for 3 min. After that, the assay mixture was immediately put on ice for 1 h for refolding. Then, the residual asparaginase activity was measured under physiological temperature conditions (37 °C). The reaction was started by addition of 40 lL of 200 mm l-Asn solution in NaCl / Pi, and quenched with 250 lL of 20 mm trichloroacetic acid. Empirical melting temperatures were read at the inflection points of the resulting activity versus temperature profiles. The asparaginase stability was also evaluated by denaturation experiments in urea solutions. In this case, 2 lL of 1000 IUÆmL)1 enzyme stock solution was mixed with 18 lL of increasing urea concentrations (from 0 to 7.2 m) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature (23 °C), all 20 lL of the assay mixture were added to 530 lL of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), containing 100 mm NaCl and 15 mm l-Asn. The reaction was stopped with 250 lL of 20 mm trichloroacetic acid. Denaturation experiments in the presence of 2.7 mm l-Asp were also conducted.

Enzymatic assay
The rate of l-Asn hydrolysis by EwA was measured in a discontinuous assay following the formation of ammonia by the Nessler method, as described elsewhere [43]. The asparaginase activity was expressed in International Units (IU), with 1 IU defined as 1 lmol of ammonia released per 1 min.

Antiproliferative assay
Human leukemia cell lines MOLT-4 (acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia), Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma) and K-562 (human chronic myeloid leukemia) were used to test asparaginase cytotoxicity. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and propagated in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% (v / v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 50 lgÆmL)1 gentamicin as antibiotic solution. Cells were plated in 96-well plates (Corning-Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) at a density of 2.5 · 104 cellsÆmL)1
