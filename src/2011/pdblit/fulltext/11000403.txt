Summary Specific hapten-immunoglobulin complexes were generated by binding mezlocillin molecules to the binding sites of specific immunoglobulins in rabbit antimezlocillin serum. The antimicrobial activity of mezlocillin against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 was examined by determination of colony forming units (cfu ml-l) within bacterial suspensions after cultivation at 37" C in Mi.iller-Hinton broth for 24 h. The antibacterial activity was significantly increased in the presence of mezlocillin-specific immunoglobulin complexes in comparison with controls without the specific complexes. The enhancement of antimicrobial efficacy may be seen as the result of more active attraction of the positively charged immunoglobulin molecules of the mezlocillin-specific immunoglobulin complexes by negatively charged bacterial cells. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic-specific immunoglobulin complexes is proposed, and the possibility of their clinical use for intensive antimicrobial treatment is discussed.

Introduction Antibiotics being low molecular weight substances act as haptens in organisms. They alone are not capable of initiating an immune response. However, specific antibodies can be produced against them as antigen epitopes if they have been conjugated to an immunogenic molecule of protein. Such antibodies do possess quite different biological activities. In patients with allergic and immunopathological disorders treated with antibiotics, specific antibodies against antibiotics have been recognized as the sensitizing immunoglobulins of the classes E and G (IgE and IgG), respectively1-3. Since the 1970s specific antibodies against antibiotics have been used to determine the concentration of the antibiotic in human body

fluids and tissues by different immunologic methods, in particular by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA)4. Using antimezlocillin antibody the binding of mezlocillin molecules to the outer cell membrane of Escherichia coli could be proved by specific immunofluorescent test'. With the help of specific monoclonal antibodies it was possible to neutralize the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotics as well as to solve several questions concerning the specificity and the mode of action of the antibioticsC9. The conjugates of specific immunoglobulins with drugs for chemotherapy or with toxins used in the therapy of cancer (chemoimmunoconjugates and immunotoxins, respectively) have a special significance at the present time lo. In these conjugates the active chemotherapeutic molecule or toxin is bound to the Fc fragment of the immunoglobulin and transported in the organism to the target cells. The immunoglobulin binds by its specific binding sites in the Fab fragments to the membrane antigen of the target cell and releases the conjugated chemotherapeutic or toxic molecule there.

In the present study we report on our investigations of antimicrobial in vitro activity of mezlocillin modified by specific rabbit antimezlocillin serum. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic-specific immunoglobulin complexes is proposed, and the possibility of their clinical use for intensive antimicrobial treatment is discussed. Materials

and methods

The investigations have been carried out with B-lactam substances: mezlocillin (MEZ) and cefmenoxime (CMX). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 1.
Specific immune sera produced in rabbits

In order to produce specific anti-MEZ and anti-CMX antibodies (RaAMEZ and RaACMX), respectively, the dissolved antibiotics were first rendered antigenic by conjugating them with the proteins of the rabbit serum". They were used for the active immunization of

the rabbits in emulsion with the complete Freund adjuvant. The occurrence, concentration and specificity of the antibodies in sera of the immunized rabbits were determined by Boyden's passive haemagglutination in microtitre plates. For this purpose, tannin-treated sheep erythrocytes sensitized with MEZ and CMX protein conjugates were used as antigens",13. The results of haemagglutination reactions can be seen in Table 1. A pool of several sera of healthy nonimmunized rabbits served as normal rabbit serum (RaNS). All sera (RaNS, RaAMEZ, RaACMX) were inactivated in a water bath at 56" C for 30 min. The total protein concentration of each serum was determined by FolinCiocalteau's reagent, after Lowry'j. The mean value was 98.5 mg ml-' f 10.5. Rabbit sera containing no antibiotic had no effect on the growth of bacteria in the broth.
Preparation of specific hapten-immunoglobulin complexes and of bacterial suspension

Cefmenoxim

All investigations have been carried out in Duran glass tubes 10 X 40 or 15 X 65 mm in size. To generate the hapten-immunoglobulin complexes 200.0 yl of saline or rabbit serum of desired concentration were first put in glass tubes. Then 200.0 ~1 of 6.0 mg 1-l MEZ solution were added to each tube. The tubes were first incubated at 37" C for 4 h and then at 4" C for 18-24 h, being shaken a few times during the incubation. The bacterial suspensions were prepared by emulsifying an 18-24 h agar slope culture of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 in 5.0 ml of Mtiller-Hinton broth. The desired concentration of bacteria was achieved by further dilution with Mtiller-Hinton broth and determined by counting the cfu in inocula of 100.0 ul on blood agar plates.

in inocula of 100.0 ~1 on blood agar plates. Four parallel inoculations of blood agar plates were made out of each tube. The blood agar plates were incubated at 37" C for 48 h. The number of colonies was counted and the purity of the S. aureu.s culture was confirmed.

Results First the mode of action of the three rabbit sera (RaNS, RaAMEZ, RaACMX) was investigated and optimized up to the level as described in Materials and methods (Figure 2). In this experiment the specific RaAMEZ immune serum was shown to have the ability to increase the bactericidal effect of mezlocillin on S. aureus ATCC 25923 after cultivation at 37" C for 24 h. Figure 2 also shows the immunologic specificity of this effect in comparison to normal (RaNS) and heterogeneous (RaACMX) sera. In a second experiment the significance of the serum concentration on the potentiating ability of the RaAMEZ immune serum was investigated (Figure 3). The optimal final dilution of RaAMEZ was 1 : 8 in experimental conditions as described. In order to satisfy the statistical requirements six parallel experiments have been carried out. Out of each tube of this experiment the number of bacteria contained in 100.0 pl was evaluated with the help of blood agar plates in four parallel trials. Thus, for statistical evaluation 6 X 4 = 24 accounts of cfu ml-' were available to determine the resulting value. Figure 4 shows the results of one of these experiments, demonstrating the value of median and the standard deviation of each value (Figure 4). The potentiating ability of the anti-MEZ immune serum as compared to both control sera (RaNS and RaACMX) can be seen. Table 2 shows the logarithms of cfu ml-' of the culture of the bacteria after incubation at 37" C for 24 h for all the six experiments. Each value represents the mean of four parallel determinations of the number of

The statistical significance was evaluated by rejecting H, at the chosen level of significance (F = 229.16; P <O.OOOl). Applying Tukey's test the minimum significant difference delta was evaluated d = 0.14429, where (Y = 0.05 as before (Table 3). Table 3 shows the results of pairwise comparisons. Whereas the two treatments, MEZ plus RaNS and MEZ plus RaACMX, are not significantly different, the treatments, MEZ plus saline and MEZ plus RaAMEZ, produce significantly larger and lower log cfu, respectively.

The 300 times larger immunoglobulin molecule not only binds and transports the small hapten molecule of the antibiotic but it also protects it from damage or destruction. Under appropriate conditions the antibiotic may be released from the specific binding sites of the immunoglobulin and exerts its antimicrobial activity. Furthermore the specific immunoglobulin acts as an extracellular messenger molecule in accordance with the following concept: The surface of bacterial cells is known to carry a negative electric charge, due to the radicals of protein and carbohydrate molecules in the outer membrane, as well as by the radicals of glycoprotein and polysaccharide molecules of the glycocalyx'6. This negative charge is determined on the basis of Nernst's equation and Donnan's equilibrium17. Therefore the bacterial cell functions as a cathode. In immunoelectrophoresis of serum proteins the immunoglobulins, especially IgG, are attracted by the cathode while albumin is attracted by the anode (Figure 5)`s. Consequently the antibiotics bound to the serum albumin as a carrier are repulsed by the negatively charged bacterial cells and hardly reach the bacterial cell surface. However, the antibiotics bound to the specific immunoglobulin are attracted by the negatively charged bacterial cells. As long as the antibiotic molecules are bound to the albumin their antibacterial efficacy is poor. On the other hand, the bacterial cells will attract and gather the specific antibiotic-IgG complexes like a cathode and the antibiotic set free in this very spot will be able to gain a potentiating antimicrobial efficacy as compared to control

Discussion The binding of the antibiotic to specific immunoglobulins against this antibiotic does not necessarily neutralize the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic itself. On the contrary, using experimental conditions as described in this paper, the antimicrobial activity of mezlocillin was rather enhanced by the specific rabbit antimezlocillin serum. In our experiments with two other antimicrobial substances, the enhancement of antimicrobial activity by specific antibody has not only been confirmed but it seemed to be even more effective than the reported enhancement of mezlocillin activity. The enhancement of antimicrobial activity by specific antibody against the antibiotic molecule obviously seems to be a phenomenon of common validity. To our knowledge, this biological phenomenon has not been described to date. As an attempt to discover the most plausible basis for explaining the mechanism of the enhancement phenomenon, we present the following hypothesis:

enhance its antimicrobial efficacy on conditions in viva and in clinical therapy remains to be answered. In a few preliminary experiments with infected rats treated with mezlocillin-specific antimezlocillin complexes we have observed a higher bactericidal efficacy as compared to control animals. The results are to be confirmed. Nevertheless, similar functioning under in viva conditions may be assumed. In this connection the concept of the bioavailability of antibiotic is to be more precisely determined. The electric charge of bacterial cells has a quite considerable importance on the antibacterial efficacy of an antibiotic in the organism. Therefore, good knowledge of the actual electric potential of an antibiotic molecule in an organism may decisively affect its bioavailability. Before using the antibiotic-specific immunoglobulin complexes in clinical therapy, their sensitizing effect on the patient must be investigated. In order to avoid the disturbing complications of sensitization. human monoclonal antibodies or their fragments could be used for producing the specific antibiotic-immunoglobulin complexes. In particular, the therapy of diseases in which the antibiotic is mostly bound to albumin and produces a high degree of toxicity, the use of such complexes with specific human monoclonal immunoglobulins as an alternative antibiotic therapy could result in a superior treatment.

without a specific immunoglobulin. Our results with mezlocillin and with two other antimicrobial substances combined with specific antibody prove these facts. The defeat of the negatively charged barrier of the bacterial cells is apparently the first step in the chain of reactions of the antimicrobial efficacy exerted by the antimicrobial molecule. The antibiotic cannot bind to structures of the bacterial cells in order to fulfil the antimicrobial efficacy unless this barrier has been broken. As early as 1913-14 Paul Ehrlich stated: "corpora non agunt nisi fixata", defining the difference of chemotherapy to the regularity of chemical reactions: "corpora non agunt nisi liquida"rY. Now, since the potentiating effect of the specific antimezlocilhn serum on the antibacterial efficacy of mezlocillin has been demonstrated, Paul Ehrlich's premise should be extended and put more precisely: "corpora non agunt nisi fixata. corpora autem non fixantur nisi attracta"*. At present we are about to confirm this theoretically constructed concept by further experiments. The quoted statement relates to the conditions in a test tube where all ingredients (antibiotic, immunoglobulin and bacterial cells) are free floating in a solution of broth. The question as to whether the antibiotic bound to the specific immunoglobulin will
