Abstract Progranulin is a secreted protein with important functions in several physiological and pathological processes, such as embryonic development, host defense, and wound repair. Autosomal dominant mutations in the progranulin gene cause frontotemporal dementia, while overexpression of progranulin promotes the invasive progression of a range of tumors, including those of the breast and the brain. Structurally, progranulin consists of seven-and-a-half tandem repeats of the granulin/epithelin module (GEM), several of which have been isolated as discrete 6-kDa GEM peptides. We have expressed all seven human GEMs using recombinant DNA in Escherichia coli. High-resolution NMR showed that only the three GEMs, hGrnA, hGrnC, and hGrnF, contain relatively well-defined three-dimensional structures in solution, while others are mainly mixtures of poorly structured disulfide isomers. The three-dimensional structures of hGrnA, hGrnC, and hGrnF contain a stable stack of two b-hairpins in their N-terminal subdomains, but showed a more flexible C-terminal subdomain. Interestingly, of the well-structured GEMs, hGrnA demonstrated potent growth inhibition of a breast cancer cell line, while hGrnF was stimulatory. Poorly folded peptides were either weakly inhibitory or without activity. The functionally active and structurally well-characterized human hGrnA offers a unique opportunity for detailed structure­function studies of these important GEM proteins as novel members of mammalian growth factors.

Granulins, also known as epithelins, are an emerging family of protein growth factors implicated in both normal physiological and disease-related processes such as embryonic development, host defense, wound repair, and tumor growth (Bateman and Bennett 1998; Lu and Serrero 2000; Zhu et al. 2002; He and Bateman 2003; He et al. 2003). Granulins or epithelins were originally discovered in human and rat tissue extracts as disulfide-rich polypeptides of ;6 kDa with four repeats of two adjacent cysteines, flanked by two pairs of single cysteines at both the N- and C-terminal ends (Bateman et al. 1990; Shoyab et al. 1990). Analysis of genomic databases revealed that the granulin/epithelin-like modules (GEMs) also exist in plants, nematodes, insects, fish, and other mammalian species (Bateman and Bennett 1998). In mammals, granulins are produced in the form of progranulin, also called the granulin/epithelin precursor (GEP), PC-derived growth factor (PCDGF), or acrogranin, containing seven-and-a-half GEM repeats arranged in tandem (Bhandari et al. 1992, 1993; Plowman et al. 1992; Baba et al. 1993). Both progranulin and some processed GEM polypeptides (e.g., epithelin-1 or rat granulin A and epithelin-2 or rat granulin B) exhibit growth-modulating activities on certain cell types (Shoyab et al. 1990; Zhou et al. 1993; Xu et al. 1998; Zhang and Serrero 1998; He and Bateman 1999; Diaz-Cueto et al. 2000). The progranulin or PGRN is constitutively expressed in a number of epithelial cells, particularly in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and the reproductive system, and also in immune cells and in specific neurons in the brain (Daniel et al. 2000). PGRN expression modulates the normal development of early embryonic epithelia (DiazCueto et al. 2000), mediates the wound response (Zanocco-Marani et al. 1999; He et al. 2003), and plays a regulatory role for the sexual differentiation of the rat brain (Suzuki et al. 1998, 2000, 2001; Suzuki and Nishiahara 2002). Very recently, autosomal dominant mutations in the PGRN, which encodes progranulin or GEP, were shown to be a major cause of frontotemporal dementia (Baker et al. 2006; Cruts et al. 2006), which is the second most common form of early-onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease (Rademakers et al. 2007). In tumor models, the elevated expression of progranulin transformed nonmalignant cancer cell lines (He and Bateman 1999) as well as immortalized human primary cells (Matsumura et al. 2006) into aggressive tumorforming cells. In contrast, decreased progranulin expression in spontaneously malignant cell lines, for example, in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (Zhang and Serrero 1998), in Hep3B liver cancer cells (Cheung et al. 2004), or in aggressive teratomas (Zhang and Serrero 1998) greatly reduced tumor growth. Progranulin influences tumorigenesis by increasing cellular proliferation (He and Bateman 1999; He et al. 2002), invasion (He et al. 2002), and survival (He et al. 2002; Tangkeangsirisin 712

et al. 2004; Kamrava et al. 2005) and is thought to contribute to tumor development in carcinomas of the breast (Zhang and Serrero 1998; Serrero and Ioffe 2003), ovary (Jones et al. 2003; Davidson et al. 2004), endometrium (Jones et al. 2006), liver (Cheung et al. 2004), kidney (Donald et al. 2001), bladder (Monami et al. 2006), prostate (Pan et al. 2004), and larynx (Kong et al. 2007), as well as in gliomas (Liau et al. 2000), myelomas (Matsumura et al. 2006), and sarcomas (Wang et al. 2003). These observations suggest that the PGRN is multifunctional, with significant roles in epithelial homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and in reproductive, immunological, and neuronal functions. Despite the significant progress made in the last few years, the structure­function relationships of proteins containing GEMs are not well understood, and the physiological roles of the 6-kDa GEM peptides remain largely uncertain. The partially characterized GrnD was found to be mitogenic for glioma cell lines (Liau et al. 2000), and depending on the cell type being assayed, GrnA/epi1 exhibited both mitogenic or growth inhibitory activities (Shoyab et al. 1990). GrnB may exert proinflammatory effects by stimulating the secretion of interleukin-8 (Zhu et al. 2002), and in inflammation, the balance between progranulin and 6-kDa GEM peptides is maintained by SLPI (secreted leukocyte protease inhibitor), which physically associates with progranulin (or GEP) and prevents its proteolytic breakdown (Zhu et al. 2002). However, no systematic attempt has been made to investigate the biological properties of all human GEMs. Low levels of human GEM peptides can be purified from human leukocytes (i.e., human granulins A, B, C, and D) (Bateman et al. 1990) and from human urine (human granulins A, B, and F) (Kardana et al. 1993; Sparro et al. 1997), but extensive biochemical and functional characterization of GEMs is hampered by the difficulties of large-scale production of structurally wellcharacterized proteins. Recombinant expression is rather challenging because of the extremely high abundance of cysteine residues in GEMs (more than 20% per module) participating in disulfide bond formation. Using Escherichia coli strains that promote disulfide bond formation, we, however, succeeded in producing all seven human GEMs and characterized their folding properties by use of NMR spectroscopy. Parallel activity assays and structural analysis have provided significant insights into the functional characteristics of the different GEM peptides. Results Expression and folding characterization of human granulin peptides Human GEM peptides (Table 1) were produced as thioredoxin fusion proteins using E. coli strain Origami(DE3), which

promotes formation of disulfide bonds of overexpressed proteins (Prinz et al. 1997). SDS-PAGE analysis of the total fusion protein showed approximately one-third of the total expressed fusion protein in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1A). Only the soluble fusion protein was collected and purified using Ni-NTA agarose columns (Fig. 1B), cleaved by recombinant enterokinase to release the GEM peptides (Fig. 1C). The crude GEM peptides thus obtained were separated from the thioredoxin tag and remaining uncleaved fusion protein by use of Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Fig. 1D). The different disulfide isomers were resolved and purified by use of reversed-phase HPLC, and this was followed by characterization of the fold by use of onedimensional (1D) NMR spectroscopy. HPLC fractions displaying large (>2 ppm) dispersion of amide proton NMR resonances were then subjected to analysis by use of homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) NMR, especially through the TOCSY and NOESY spectra (data not shown). Eventually, five major HPLC fractions, hGrnA, hGrnC1, hGrnC2, hGrnF1, and hGrnF2 (Fig. 2), for hGrnA, hGrnC, and hGrnF were found to be homogeneous, and thus potentially well-structured and suitable for further studies. However, none of the fractions of granulins B or E displayed NMR signal dispersion typical of a protein with even partial structure formation. HPLC fractions of granulins D and G with the lowest retention time were not spectrally homogeneous, that is, more than one NMR signal was observed for some unique protons of each GEM species. Interestingly, the structured fractions of granulins A, C, and F all had smaller retention times (Fig. 2), and they were well separated from the other isomers. This observation confirms an earlier finding that oxidized and well-folded N-terminal subdomains from other GEMs all have markedly smaller retention times than the corresponding unfolded peptides with reduced cysteine thiol groups (Vranken et al. 1999; Tolkatchev et al. 2000). HPLC fractions of hGrnA, hGrnC1, hGrnC2, and hGrnF2 were further characterized by mass-spectral

analysis, which showed that these recombinant peptides were full-length GEMs with six disulfide bonds, whereas hGrnF1 is a proteolytic product of human granulin F (with a molecular weight of 4494 vs. theoretical 8055, mass spectra not shown). Fractions hGrnC1 and hGrnC2 appear to be interconvertible while still in the form of the

inhibition was achieved at a nanomolar concentration of the purified peptide (Fig. 3A). Stimulatory activity is particularly pronounced for hGrnF (Fig. 3A), which is also relatively well-structured as judged by use of 1D NMR spectra. All these purified GEM peptides had confirmed full-length primary structures as expected from the recombinant DNA sequence. NMR resonance assignment and determination of disulfide bonds in human GEMs High-quality 2D NMR spectra of recombinant hGrnA, hGrnC1, hGrnC2, hGrnF1, and hGrnF2 (e.g., that of hGrnA in Fig. 4A) enabled residue-specific signal assignment using either 15N-labeled samples (for hGrnA and hGrnF) or direct homonuclear proton 2D TOCSY and NOESY spectra with unlabeled samples. [15N,1H]-HSQC spectra for hGrnF1 and hGrnF2 fractions were partly superimposable, except for the presence in hGrnF2 of several poorly resolved overlapping peaks (spectra not shown). Further analysis of 15N-labeled hGrnF1 showed that its NMR spectrum is that of only the N-terminal fragment of the full-length hGrnF, which is consistent with the mass spectrometric data (see above). The NMR line widths were also narrower for hGrnF1, all indicating that the C-terminal part of hGrnF2 may be flexible or predominantly unstructured. In addition, we found that residues Tyr14, Thr15, Cys17, Gly25, and Cys27 in hGrnA and Cys17, Gly25, and Cys27 in hGrnF1 had slowly exchanging amide protons, but none was detected for the hGrnC1 and hGrnC2 samples. With resonance assignments, Klaus et al. (1993) showed that a disulfide link between two cysteine residues can be located by the presence of NOE connectivities between CbH­CbH and CaH­CbH atoms, whereas the presence of an NOE between NH and CaH of two cysteines is a strong indication for the absence of a disulfide bridge between them. Using the same approach, we analyzed the NOE connectivities for hGrnA, hGrnC1, hGrnC2, and hGrnF1 (dissolved in D2O) to determine the disulfide-bonding pattern as we have done for several GEM-derived halfmodule peptides arranged in a stack of two b-hairpins (Vranken et al. 1999; Tolkatchev et al. 2000, 2001). To facilitate further discussion, Figure 4B shows a schematic three-dimensional (3D) model with disulfide bond connectivities of a prototypic member of the GEM protein family, that is, carp granulin-1 (Hrabal et al. 1996). For hGrnA, we found all eight unique NOE connectivities between the CbH­CbH and CaH­CbH atoms in the cysteine pair Cys4­Cys16. Also, we observed four unique NOEs between CaH­CbH atoms in the cysteine pair Cys10­Cys26. There were two unique NOE connectivities between CaH and low-field CbH atoms from the cysteine pair Cys42­Cys55, and a unique NOE peak between the

fusion protein with the N-terminal thioredoxin tag, since longer exposure of the fusion protein to neutral pH resulted in a higher yield of hGrnC2 at the expense of hGrnC1 (data not shown). After cleavage, hGrnC1 and hGrnC2 were stable in solution and did not exhibit detectable structural changes within a period of several months. Apparently, hGrnC2 represents a derivative of hGrnC1 with reshuffled disulfide bonds (vida infra). Functional activities of human GEM peptides in a cell-based assay All the major fractions of each expressed human GEM peptide were subjected to a cell-growth assay using the MDA-MB-468 cancer cell line. Most of the purified peptides, including the relatively well-structured hGrnC1 and hGrnC2, are weakly inhibitory for the proliferation of the MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 3). The well-structured hGrnA is particularly notable in this regard, as a marked 714

high-field CbH atom of Cys17 and the low-field CbH atom of Cys34. Other NOE peaks consistent with the CbH­CbH connectivities in the pairs Cys10­Cys26, Cys17­Cys34, and Cys42­Cys55 were observed as well, but they could not be unambiguously assigned because of NMR spectral overlaps. In addition, an NH­CaH NOE connectivity was found for the cysteine pair Cys27­Cys16. These data conclusively demonstrate the formation of disulfide bonds for cysteine pairs Cys4­Cys16 and Cys10­Cys26 and strongly suggest a disulfide pairing between cysteines 42 and 55, and support the pairing of cysteines 17 and 34. Similarly, we established formation of the disulfide bonds Cys4­Cys16 (i.e., the [1­3] pairing) and Cys10­ Cys26 ([2­5]) in hGrnC1, hGrnC2, and hGnrF1, and found evidence in favor of the presence of disulfide bonds Cys35­Cys48 ([8­11] pairing) and Cys42­Cys55 ([10­ 12] pairing) in hGrnC1 and hGrnC2. The full list of NOE connectivities for disulfide bond determination in human GEM peptides is shown in Supplemental Table S2. Overall, formation of the disulfide bonds Cys4­Cys16 ([1­3] pairing) and Cys10­Cys26 ([2­5] pairing) can be established by use of NMR data for all structured granulin modules because of the high spectral resolution in the N-terminal subdomain, explicit Cys­Cys side-chain NOE connectivities, and other NMR structural evidence, such as expected patterns of NOE contacts (vida infra) in the well-structured N-terminal stack of two b-hairpins (Hrabal et al. 1996; Vranken et al. 1999, 2002; Tolkatchev et al. 2000, 2001). In contrast, the disulfide

bonds connecting the N- and C-terminal subdomains were practically impossible to detect by use of NMR in any human granulin module. Stereochemical analysis of the disulfide pairing in human granulin modules Some uncertainty in the disulfide pairing of cysteines, connecting the N-terminal S2H with the C-terminal subdomain, or disulfide formation involving cysteines 17, 27, 34, and 41, can be resolved by the analysis of the 3D structural information from NMR spectroscopy. Generally speaking, there are a total of three possibilities for pairing these four cysteines, that is, [Cys17­Cys27; Cys34­Cys41], [Cys17­Cys34; Cys27­Cys41], and [Cys17­Cys41; Cys27­Cys34]. One of these three possibilities, i.e., [Cys17­Cys27; Cys34­Cys41], can be discarded for the following reasons: Analysis of the interstrand NOE connectivities in well-structured human GEMs demonstrates that cysteines 17 and 27 are located at positions ÀCysi+1 and +Cysi+1, where À and + denote two different strands of a b-hairpin, and i, i+1 indicate positions of cysteine residues in each strand as illustrated in Figure 4C. The in-register non-hydrogen-bonding positions ÀCysi and +Cysi are occupied by cysteines 16 and 26, respectively. This pattern of cysteines in the second bhairpin is typical of the N-terminal S2H topology (Hrabal et al. 1996; Vranken et al. 1999; Tolkatchev et al. 2000, 2001). Owing to the constraints of disulfide-bond stereochemistry,

formation of a Cys­Cys bond between two antiparallel strands is sterically precluded, except for some cases in which half-cysteines are located in the non-hydrogenbonding register of the b-hairpin (ÀCysi and +Cysi in Fig. 4C) (Gunasekaran et al. 1997; Hutchinson et al. 1998). Therefore, pairing [Cys17­Cys27; Cys34­Cys41] is highly improbable without compromising the structural integrity of the second b-hairpin, shown to be the most stable in hGrnA and hGrnF1 by amide proton-deuterium exchange. We obtained further experimental evidence for the incompatibility of the ÀCysi+1­+Cysi+1 disulfide pairing with the S2H topology using the example of human paragranulin peptide. Human paragranulin is a half-granulin repeat found in the N terminus of progranulin (Bhandari et al. 1992; Plowman et al. 1992) with the sequence of T1RCPDGQF CP10VACCLDPGGA20SYSCCRPLLD30. The peptide corresponds to the N-terminal S2H domain of a consensus GEM sequence. Two peptides derived from the wild-type paragranulin sequence were produced, one with cysteines 14 and 25 replaced with serine and cysteines 9 and 24 blocked with S-acetamidomethyl groups (Acm) [hGrnP (C9CAcm, C14S, C24CAcm, C25S)], and another with cysteines 14 and 25 blocked with Acm [hGrnP(C14CAcm, C25CAcm)]. The peptide [hGrnP(C9CAcm, C14S, C24CAcm, C25S)] was oxidized in two steps (see Materials and Methods), directing the formation of a [Cys3­ Cys13; Cys9­Cys24] disulfide-bonding pattern expected for the N-terminal subdomain of GEMs. The peptide [hGrnP(C14CAcm, C25CAcm)] was oxidized by air, and such spontaneous oxidation produced the same disulfidepairing pattern. Both peptides exhibited very similar and well-resolved NMR spectra typical of a well-folded S2H (Fig. 5A­C). Assignment of NOEs confirmed the specific arrangement of the cysteine residues observed for the second b-hairpin in an S2H topology (D. Tolkatchev, unpubl.). The oxidized peptide hGrnP(C14CAcm, C25CAcm) was then subjected to oxidation of the S-Acm blocked cysteines 14 and 25, located at the sites ÀCysi+1 and +Cysi+1 of the second b-hairpin, specifically in acidic conditions to prevent disulfide-bond reshuffling (Hunter and Komives 1995). Introduction of such an artificial Cys14­Cys25 disulfide bond caused severe broadening of several NMR peaks in the peptide especially for residues in the second b-hairpin (Fig. 5D). Such NMR line broadening suggests the presence of extensive conformational exchange processes in the peptide induced by the unfavorable disulfide bond Cys14­Cys25. Chemical determination of disulfide-bond pairing in hGrnA The assignment of disulfide bonds by use of NMR and structural data was difficult to achieve for the cysteines located in the structurally flexible region corresponding

to the third b-hairpin, and further disulfide mapping by proteolytic cleavage was unsuccessful (data not shown). For further analysis, we therefore adopted a cysteine cyanylation/cleavage methodology that identifies cysteine pairing in proteins with adjacent cysteine residues (Wu and Watson 1997, 1998; Yang et al. 1998; Qi et al. 2001). After partial reduction by TCEP under conditions that open predominantly only one disulfide bridge, the resulting sulfhydryls are then cyanylated with the use of CDAP. Upon purification by HPLC, the cyanylated peptides are cleaved by aqueous ammonia on the N-terminal side of the cyanylated cysteines (see Materials and Methods for details). Three peptides are obtained after reduction of the remaining intact disulfide bridges; these are the peptide N-terminal to the first cleavage site,

and two with iminothiazolidinyl carboxylate modified N termini that correspond to the peptide cleaved between the two cyanylated cysteines, and to the peptide cleaved at the C terminus of the second cyanylated cysteine, respectively. To promote accumulation of the species containing cyanylated cysteines from the conformationally flexible region, we omitted the guanidine chloride denaturant from the TCEP/CDAP reaction. To minimize potential problems such as incomplete cyanylation, incomplete cleavage, b-elimination, and even disulfide scrambling, which may complicate interpretation of the results (Qi et al. 2001), we performed independent reduction/cyanylation/cleavage procedures using slightly different temperature and reaction times. Recombinant hGrnA showed an estimated mass of 7889.2 6 1.0 by use of mass spectrometry, which matches the theoretical 7889.3 with all cysteines in an oxidized cysteine form. A partially reduced/CDAP-treated hGrnA appears in the reversed-phase HPLC chromatogram (see Materials and Methods for details) as a single additional peak with retention time longer (by ;1.5 min) than the fully reduced hGrnA (profile not shown). Since the amount of TCEP-reduced protein was less than 10% of the initial fully oxidized hGrnA, most of the reduced species should represent hGrnA with a singly reduced disulfide bond. This was confirmed by a mass spectrum of the cyanylated species showing an average mass of 7947.7, which is in close agreement with a theoretical average mass 7946.9 of hGrnA with two cyanylated cysteines. Every open and cyanylated disulfide bond ideally should yield three fragments after the alkaline cleavage. We have consistently observed the presence of three MALDI peaks with an m/z average of 3878.1, 1456.9, and 2656.8 (spectra not shown). The observation of these three fragments supports the CN-induced cleavage before cysteines 35 and 48 [theoretical m/z values of the corresponding fragments are 3878.5 for hGrnA-(-2)-34red, 1456.6 for hGrnA-itz-35-47-red, and 2656.9 for hGrnA-itz-48-70-red, respectively, where red indicates that non-cyanylated cysteines were completely reduced after alkaline cleavage]. These data suggest strongly that there is a disulfide pairing between the two cysteines 35 and 48. MALDI analysis of partially reduced/cyanylated/ cleaved hGrnA implied that the HPLC peak, corresponding to the cyanylated species, may also contain more than one species corresponding to differently opened disulfide bonds. Ions with m/z values of 1923.6 and 3335.9 were also observed, which were assigned to the C-terminal fragments of hGrnA produced by the CN-induced cleavage before cysteines 55 (i.e., hGrnA-itz-55-70-red) and 41 (hGrnA-itz-41-70-red), respectively. Since NMR spectroscopy data indicate that Cys55 is connected with Cys42, this probably represents the minor admixtures of other disulfide paired isomers in the hGrnA preparation

at concentrations that are difficult to identify by use of NMR spectra. Taking into account the experimental error of mass determination (;0.05%), it is technically possible that peaks at 1456.9 and 1923.6 are the products of hGrnA with an open disulfide bond between cysteines 41 and 55, with theoretical m/z values of 1455.6 (hGrnA-itz41-54-red) and 1923.1 (hGrnA-itz-55-70-red). However, we could not clearly identify the third fragment that would have formed in this case with a theoretical average mass of 4613.3 [hGrnA-(-2)-40-red]. Consequently, MALDI spectra are best explained by the formation of a disulfide bond between residues Cys35 and Cys48. Three-dimensional structures of human GEMs in solution Backbone­backbone NOE connectivities, CaH chemical shift values, and slowly exchanging amide protons were used to identify secondary structure elements of the wellstructured hGrnA, hGrnC1, hGrnC2, and hGrnF1 modules (Fig. 6). The derived set of NOE distances, chemical shift-based angle constraints, and angle constraints from 3 JHN­Ha coupling constants were used for structure calculations (Linge et al. 2001) together with the same six disulfide bonds identified for hGrnA as those found in carp granulin 1 (Fig. 4B). For hGrnC1 and hGrnC2, only disulfide bonds within the N- and C-terminal subdomains were used, whereas cysteines 17, 27, 34, and 41 were left free. The structural calculation for hGrnF1 included only two disulfide bonds, Cys4­Cys16 and Cys10­Cys26.

Including the interdomain disulfide bonds between cysteines 17, 27, 34, and 41 had very little effect on the structural characteristics of the resulting 3D models of hGrnA, hGrnC1, and hGrnC2, since only very few NOE connectivities were found between the second b-hairpin and the region that corresponds to the third b-hairpin. The calculated structures showed again that all four human GEM species are b-strand proteins, each with a welldefined N-terminal stack of two b-hairpins (Fig. 7). The formation of another b-hairpin, corresponding to the fourth b-hairpin in cGrn1, was also established for hGrnA and hGrnC1. In all the granulin molecules, the N-terminal subdomain was consistently better defined than the C-terminal part (Fig. 7; see Table 2). The second b-hairpin is particularly well defined in all structured human granulins, with the two b-strands joined together by a 3:5 b-hairpin loop (Sibanda and Thornton 1991). In hGrnC1 and hGrnF1, the 3:5 b-hairpin loop has a propensity toward the formation of a more specific 3:5 G1 b-bulge (Sibanda and Thornton 1991), also found earlier in cGrn1 (Hrabal et al. 1996), and related peptides (Tolkatchev et al. 2000; Vranken et al. 2002). The structure of the first b-hairpin in all four GEM peptides is not as well defined as the second, with some of the residues having broadened amide proton signals, most likely resulting from conformational exchange processes. Despite the general structural uncertainty of the C-terminal subdomain, the fourth b-hairpin is still fairly well structured. The fourth b-hairpin may contain a 3:5 (for hGrnC1) or 4:4 (for hGrnA) loop (Sibanda and Thornton 1991). It is the region corresponding to the third b-hairpin in cGrn1 that is practically undefined structurally. Such a putative ``third b-hairpin'' region normally contains the largest number of residues with broad NMR signals, which make it difficult to achieve resonance assignments and to obtain structural information. Even in well-structured cGrn1, the third b-hairpin is also the region with the poorest structural definition (747­752) (Hrabal et al. 1996). Discussion Granulins are a unique family of proteins with a highly characteristic primary sequence rich in the doublecysteine (i.e., CC) motif (Bateman and Bennett 1998). Determination of the 3D structure of carp granulin 1 (cGrn1), a prototypic member of the family from the carp fish (Belcourt et al. 1993, 1995), revealed a novel protein architecture of a stack of four b-hairpins (Hrabal et al. 1996). The four b-hairpins of cGrn1 are arranged and stapled together by six parallel disulfide bonds, leading to a ladder-shaped topology. Therefore, the full-length cGrn1 is extremely stable with a well-defined 3D structure, especially for the 30-residue N-terminal subdomain

Figure 7. The clusters of the 10 lowest-energy human granulin structures superimposed using the backbone of the residues in structurally defined regions. Regions corresponding to the third b-hairpin of cGrn1 (Hrabal et al. 1996) are consistently poorly defined and, for clarity of presentation, are not displayed. The N- and C-terminal fragments of hGrnA are superimposed over the backbone atoms of residues (2­4, 7­19, 23­28) and (45­49, 52­57), respectively. The N- and C-terminal fragments of hGrnC1/hGrnC2 are superimposed over the backbone atoms of residues (6­11, 14­20, 22­27) and (41­58), respectively. HGrnF1 is superimposed over the backbone atoms of residues (2­4, 8­11, 14­28).

(Hrabal et al. 1996; Vranken et al. 1999, 2002). The structural integrity of cGrn1 is further enhanced by a network of hydrophobic contacts between the first and second bhairpins and by a hydrophobic cluster of residues on top of the first b-hairpin (Vranken et al. 1999, 2002; Tolkatchev et al. 2000). In contrast, mammalian granulins lack several hydrophobic and turn-stabilizing amino acid residues that are believed to contribute to the remarkable stability of cGrn1 and its N-terminal subdomain (Tolkatchev et al. 2000, 2001). Human granulins, in particular, are produced in the form of a precursor protein, the progranulin or granulin/epithelin precursor (GEP), containing seven-and-a-half repeats of the granulin/epithelin module (GEM) (Bhandari et al. 1992, 1993; Plowman et al. 1992; Baba et al. 1993). Both progranulin and some isolated GEMs were found to display cell growth-modulating activity, but it is unclear if processed human GEMs possess unique 3D structures and in what way structural properties determine their putative functions. There is growing evidence that implicates the overexpression of the mammalian PGRN in the development of several human cancers, many of which present serious clinical challenges (Zhang and Serrero 1998; He and Bateman 1999; Lu and Serrero 2000, 2001; Markert et al. 2001; He et al. 2002), its involvement in wound healing processes (Zanocco-Marani et al. 1999; He et al. 2003), and aberrant mutations leading to dementia (He et al. 2003; Baker et al. 2006; Cruts et al. 2006). To date, there has been no systematic survey of the activity of all the seven potential GEMs using structurally well-defined granulin peptides. As an important step forward, we have expressed all seven human GEMs in E. coli strains that promote proper disulfide formation between the many cysteines in the GEM sequence. Many of these recombinant peptides were found to be biologically active as growth inhibitors of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, which are known to be highly dependent on intrinsic progranulin secretion for tumor growth (Lu and Serrero 2000). Our results show modest to absent bioactivity for poorly structured peptides (Fig. 3B). However, the well-folded peptides demonstrate highly divergent activity with the full-length hGrnF2 showing strong proliferative activity while hGrnA1 acts as a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation even at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3A). This is the first demonstration of biological activity associated with the granulin F module and raises the possibility that this module contributes to the activity of the full-length progranulin protein. Interestingly, the hGrnC1 and hGrnC2 peptides were only weakly inhibitory and closely paralleled activity seen for poorly structured GEMs despite being well-folded in solution (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ability to adopt the granulin fold in solution is necessary but not

Regions containing continuous stretches of amino acid residues 1­29 and 42­57 (hGrnA), 2­29 and 42­56 (hGrnC1 and hGrnC2), and 2­28 (hGrnF1) correspond to the N-terminal S2H and the fourth cysteine loop, respectively, of the granulin modules. Stretches 2­4, 7­19, 23­28, and 45­49, 52­57 (hGrnA), 6­11, 14­20, 22­27, and 41­56 (hGrnC1 and hGrnC2), and 2­4, 8­11, 14­28 (hGrnF1) are comparatively well-structured fragments with low local RMSD values.

sufficient, as for hGrnC1 and hGrnC2, for imparting strong biological activity and that the specific amino acid sequence of the folded peptides must also be critical. It remains to be determined whether hGrnA and hGrnF modulate cell growth by acting as an antagonist/agonist for the progranulin receptor or act on their own receptor/ binding proteins. Our structural analyses revealed that at least three human GEMs out of seven, hGrnA, hGrnC, and hGrnF, can form the N-terminal stack of two b-hairpins (S2H) with an expected crisscross disulfide-pairing pattern [Cys4­Cys16; Cys10­Cys26] (Hrabal et al. 1996; Vranken et al. 1999; Tolkatchev et al. 2000). This observation indicates that the amino acid sequence of GEMs must dictate the specific structural folding, favoring the formation of the N-terminal S2H, given the large number (10,395) of possibilities of disulfide pairing for a single granulin module. In addition, the second b-hairpin in the N-terminal subdomain appears to be the most stable in the whole protein. In contrast, hGrnD was spectrally inhomogeneous, displaying coexistence of at least two molecular species even after purification. In addition, hGrnB and hGrnE showed little evidence of structure formation, suggesting that specific cues for efficient autonomous folding may exist within the primary sequences only in some but not in all isolated GEMs. At present, it is unknown whether hGrnB and E adopt stable folds in the intact progranulin, if so it would imply long-range stabilization of the fold within the larger protein. A unique structure fold for hGrnB within progranulin may explain why two out of the three missense mutations in dementia patients occur in the sequence region of granulin B (van der Zee et al. 2007). Through structure modeling, the Pro248Leu mutation (at the site of Pro43 in hGrnB) (see Table 1) was predicted to have a destabiliz720

ing effect on the putative S4H (stack of four b-hairpins) fold for hGrnB, leading to pathogenesis (van der Zee et al. 2007). On the other hand, the standard S4H fold assumed for hGrnB cannot rationalize a second missense mutation, Ser258Asn, also occurring in the granulin B domain of a pathogenic progranulin (i.e., Ser53 of hGrnB) (Table 1). It is interesting to note, however, that the hGrnB module can exist as a stable GEM protein as it has been isolated from human inflammatory cells and rat bone marrow (Bateman et al. 1990; Shoyab et al. 1990) and found in human urine along with the better-structured granulins A and F (Sparro et al. 1997). In addition, singledomain hGrnB proteins have been shown to possess biological activities (Shoyab et al. 1990). In all, further studies are needed in order to clarify the folding characteristics of hGrnB and its detailed structure­activity relationships. The C-terminal subdomain of human GEMs is highly flexible and apparently less stable structurally. Unlike the N-terminal S2H, it appears to be more susceptible to proteolysis leading to internal cleavages of hGrnF. In previous studies, synthetic N-terminal fragments of hGrnA were found to be structurally flexible in solution (Tolkatchev et al. 2000). The greatly enhanced stability of the N-terminal S2H in the complete hGrnA peptide implies that the C-terminal subdomain must contribute to structural stabilization through interdomain interactions. In addition, putative rearrangement of the disulfide-bond connectivity between the N- and C-terminal subdomains leads to poorer structural definition of hGrnC2 as compared to that of hGrnC1. On the other hand, structural folding of GEMs appears to tolerate insertions/deletions of amino acid residues observed in the first and fourth b-hairpins of human granulin sequences. One additional amino acid residue in the fourth b-hairpin of hGrnA

versus hGrnC1 is accommodated by the transformation of a 3:5 into a 4:4 b-hairpin loop. Also, an insertion of a Glu9a in hGrnF alters the shape of its N-terminal bhairpin; however, the second b-hairpin remains structurally the same as that of the other well-structured granulin modules. Therefore, a limited number of highly conserved amino acid residues are likely to serve structural roles for stabilizing the specific GEM scaffold around the core second b-hairpin. The 3D structures of human GEMs are generally not as well defined as that of cGrn1; nevertheless, a comparison of cGrn1 and hGrnA reveals very similar structural tendencies in these two well-structured GEM molecules. Although some uncertainty in the disulfide pairing of human GEMs between the N-and C-terminal subdomains still remains, the available data for hGrnA and hGrnC1 are consistent with the disulfidepairing pattern found for cGrn1 (Fig. 4B). In summary, this is the first systematic study of the structure and activity of all the GEMs in a mammalian progranulin. It demonstrates that production of the disulfiderich granulin family can be performed in a ``parallel'' manner, and that well-structured species can be easily identified and characterized by use of NMR spectroscopy. This approach opens an opportunity for much-needed functional studies of the GEM proteins in a variety of biological and biochemical processes. Our findings also indicate the overall complexity of the progranulin molecule and suggest further strategies to target specific domains within progranulin in order to mitigate promitotic activity in cancer.

Express medium supplied with 100 mg/mL carbenicillin in 2.8-L flasks to give an OD600 of 0.035. The cell culture was shaken at 22°C until the OD600 reached 0.7, and induced by 0.5 mM IPTG. After induction, the culture was shaken for another 6 h at 22°C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation.

Protein purification and characterization
Frozen cells from 1 L of culture were thawed at 0°C and resuspended in 50 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. Lysozyme from hen egg white (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to 1.0 mg/mL, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice. After incubation, protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, and leupeptin were added to the mixture to the final concentration of 100 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 1 mg/mL, respectively. The mixture was sonicated for 4 min on ice with interruption for 10 s every 20 s. DNase I (10 mg/mL) and RNase A (5 mg/mL) were added to the cell lysate, followed by incubation for 20 min on ice. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000g for 30 min to remove the insoluble fraction. Crystalline urea was added to the cleared cell lysate to a final concentration of 4 M. To the final solution (70 mL), 16 mL of 50% Ni-NTA agarose resin (QIAGEN) slurry was added and mixed gently for 1 h on ice. All the following steps of protein purification were carried out at room temperature. The slurry of protein/resin mixture was loaded onto a 20-mL column and progressively washed with 50 mL of 8 M urea in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, and 50 mL of 8 M urea in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 5.9. The fusion protein (;6­80 mg/L of cell culture) was eluted with 16 mL of 8 M urea in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 4.5. Approximately 30 mg of eluted fusion protein was initially transferred into 2­3 mL of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, and 8.0 M urea, at pH 7.0, by means of buffer exchange on an Amicon Centriprep YM-10 membrane. The concentrations of the fusion protein and urea were then adjusted to 1.0­1.5 mg/mL and 0.5­1.2 M, respectively, by a rapid onestep dilution with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, at pH 7.0, and supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2. In general, release of the GEM peptides was enabled by enterokinase (Novagen) added to a concentration of 2.0 units/ mg of the fusion protein, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 48 h at 37°C. However, the thioredoxin-hGrnE fusion protein was performed on the Ni-NTA agarose resin to prevent protein aggregation in the solution phase. Ni-NTA agarose beads with the immobilized fusion protein (8 mL) were washed on a column with 70 mL of a buffer that was 10 mM in sodium phosphate, 150 mM in NaCl, at pH 7.0, supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2 and transferred into an equal volume of the same buffer. Recombinant enterokinase (Novagen) was added, and the mixture was incubated with gentle shaking for 24­48 h at 37°C. The extent of the cleavage reactions was verified by SDS-PAGE. Final purification of the GEM peptides was carried out by use of reversed-phase HPLC, following essentially the same procedures as established previously (Belcourt et al. 1993). Briefly, 10­15 mg of the cleaved fusion protein was pre-treated by use of the 2g Vac Sep-Pak R C18 columns and eluted by 1.1 vol of 35%­45% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The partially purified granulin samples were further purified by use of a 0.46 3 25 cm Vydac C18 HPLC column and if necessary, on a Vydac C8 HPLC column and lyophilized until further use. Protein concentrations were estimated by measuring the absorption coefficients at 280

Materials and Methods Cloning and recombinant expression of human granulins in E. coli
Double-strand DNA fragments encoding human GEMs hGrnX (where X denotes A, B, C, D, E, F, or G) were subcloned from the cDNA of full-length progranulin (PGRN) into the expression vector pET32b (Novagen) (Supplemental Table S1). All the expression plasmids were prepared as thioredoxin-hGrnX fusions, which were expressed in the E. coli strain Origami (DE3) (Novagen). The transformed E. coli cells were cultured in shake flasks at 22°C in LB medium containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin. Protein expression was induced when the cells had grown to an OD600 of 0.6­0.8 by the addition of isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5­1 mM. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation at 3000g for 25 min, at 4°C. The cell pellets were stored frozen at À20°C until use. Samples of hGrnA and hGrnF required for some NMR experiments were uniformly labeled with the 15N isotope by growing the transformed Origami(DE3) cells in the 15N-labeled rich medium Bio-Express-1000 (Cambridge Isotope Labs). Fifteen milliliters of LB medium containing 100 mg/mL carbenicillin was inoculated with a single colony and shaken for 20 h at 37°C. The overnight culture was centrifuged at 2000g for 20 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 L of 0.53 Bio-

NMR experiments and structural calculations Bioassays
Seven thousand breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468), obtained from ATCC, were seeded per well in 96-well plates (Corning, Inc.) in the presence of the RPMI medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 10 mg/mL Gentamicin (Invitrogen). The cells were first incubated at 37°C (5% CO2) for 24 h and then for 24 h in serum-free medium. Thereafter, the cells were kept in serum-free RPMI medium supplemented with or without a GEM peptide and incubated for a further 4 d. Cells were then trypsinized, and viable cells, as assessed using trypan blue exclusion, were counted with a hemocytometer. All assays were performed in triplicate. One-dimensional proton NMR spectra were acquired for lyophilized HPLC fractions dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM EDTA, 10% D2O, at pH 6.8, or in 20 mM sodium acetate-d3 buffer, 10% D2O, at pH 5.0. For amide proton/deuterium exchange, the buffered NMR samples were further lyophilized and redissolved in an equal volume of D2O at room temperature. A series of NMR spectra was acquired of the protein samples in D2O, and in the case of 15Nlabeled proteins, a series of [15N,1H]-HSQC spectra was recorded immediately. The protein concentration for all NMR samples was ;0.5­1.0 mM. All NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 500 MHz and 800 MHz spectrometers at 288 K and 298 K. TOCSY (Braunschweiler and Ernst 1983) (tSL ¼ 35­ 65 ms) and NOESY (Lippens et al. 1995) (tm ¼ 120 and 200 ms) spectra were recorded, processed, and assigned as described previously (Tolkatchev et al. 2000). The complete data set for 15N-labeled samples included [15N,1H]-HSQC, 2D 15N-decoupled flip-back TOCSY (tSL ¼ 33­60 ms), 2D 15N-decoupled flip-back NOESY (tm ¼ 200 ms), 3D 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC (tSL ¼ 58 ms), 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (tm ¼ 200 ms) (Sattler et al. 1999), and MJ[15N,1H]-HSQC (Heikkinen et al. 1999). NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and converted to the format used by NMRView (Johnson and Blevins 1994) for further analysis. Residue-specific assignment of the 15N and proton resonances was achieved by spin system identification using [15N,1H]-HSQC, 2D 15N-decoupled TOCSY and 3D 15Nedited TOCSY-HSQC spectra, followed by sequential assignment through NOE connectivities from 2D 15N-decoupled NOESY and 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC. The NOE cross-peak assignment was performed in part manually, in part using iterative structure-based ARIA assignment protocols (Linge et al. 2001), followed by structure calculations using the Structure Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) (Brunger et al. 1998). 3JHN­Ha coupling constants for the 15 N-labeled samples were determined from MJ-[15N,1H]-HSQC (Heikkinen et al. 1999) or from DQF-COSY (Kim and Prestegard 1989) spectra. Values between 5.0 and 8.0 Hz were discarded, and an error of 61 Hz was assumed in converting the remaining coupling constants to dihedral f angle constraints, using the parameterization of Vuister and Bax (1993). The chemical shift index-based dihedral angles for the b-sheet regions were restrained to (À135 6 50) for the f angle and (135 6 50) for the c angle. Initial ARIA-CNS calculation runs were performed in order to remove assignment errors, noise, and other artifacts from the complete NOE peak list. The calculated structures were analyzed and visualized with the Sybyl (Tripos), InsightII (Biosym), and Molmol (Koradi et al. 1996) software programs. Obtained structure coordinates (i.e., those shown in Fig. 7) were deposited into the Protein Data Bank (hGrnA, PDB: 2jye; hGrnC1, PDB: 2jyt; hGrnC2, PDB: 2jyu; hGrnF, PDB: 2jyv).

Disulfide mapping of hGrnA using the cyanylation/cleavage methodology
Partial reduction, cyanylation, and cleavage of the recombinant hGrnA were carried out essentially as described by Wu and Watson (1997, 1998). Freshly prepared 20 nmol of hGrnA was dissolved in 27 mL of 100 mM citric acid (pH 3.0). Fourteen microliters of 0.01 M tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCAP) in the same buffer was added to the hGrnA solution, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature. After 10 min, 16 mL of 0.1 M 1-cyano-4-dimethylamino-pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) was added to the hGrnA sample under the same buffer conditions, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 120 mL of 20% TFA and desalted on a Waters 360 mg Sep-Pak C18 column. The peptides were eluted with 3 mL of 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA, and the eluted fractions were diluted twice with 0.1% TFA before application onto a 1.0 3 25 cm Vydac C8 HPLC column, equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The fractions were subsequently eluted with a linear 10%­70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% TFA, at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. Two to three nanomoles of the purified cyanylated products was specifically cleaved in 40 mL of 1 M NH4OH, 6 M guanidine chloride for 1 h at room temperature. The cleaved sample was dried under vacuum and reduced with 20 mL of 50 mM TCEP in 100 mM citric acid, pH 4.0, for 30 min at 37°C.

Synthesis and purification of peptide fragments
Two peptides corresponding to the sequence of human paragranulin (T1RCPDGQFZP10VACSLDPGGA20SYSZSRPLLD30 [hGrnP(C9CAcm, C14S, C24CAcm, C25S)] and T1RCPDG QFCP10VACZLDPGGA20SYSCZRPLLD30 [hGrnP(C14CAcm, C25CAcm)], where Z ¼ S-acetamidomethyl-cysteine) were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using standard Fmoc chemistry. Disulfide bonds were formed in two steps as described previously (Yang et al. 1994; Hunter and Komives 1995; Tolkatchev et al. 2000). Briefly, unprotected cysteine residues were first oxidized by air at pH 8.0­8.5. In the second step S-acetamidomethyl-cysteines were deprotected and oxidized as described by Hunter and Komives (1995). The disulfide-bonding pattern of well-folded isomers was established by
