Crystal Structure of the Zinc-binding Transport Protein ZnuA from Escherichia coli Reveals an Unexpected Variation in Metal Coordination
Hua Li and Gerwald Jogl
Department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA Bacterial ATP-binding cassette transport systems for high-affinity uptake of zinc and manganese use a cluster 9 solute-binding protein. Structures of four cluster 9 transport proteins have been determined previously. However, the structural determinants for discrimination between zinc and manganese remain under discussion. To further investigate the variability of metal binding sites in bacterial transporters, we have determined the structure of the zinc-bound transport protein ZnuA from Escherichia coli to 1.75 Å resolution. The overall structure of ZnuA is similar to other solute-binding transporters. A scaffolding -helix forms the backbone for two structurally related globular domains. The metalbinding site is located at the domain interface. The bound zinc ion is coordinated by three histidine residues (His78, His161 and His225) and one glutamate residue (Glu77). The functional role of Glu77 for metal binding is unexpected, because this residue is not conserved in previously determined structures of zinc and manganese-specific transport proteins. The observed metal coordination by four protein residues differs significantly from the zinc-binding site in the ZnuA transporter from Synechocystis 6803, which binds zinc via three histidine residues. In addition, the E. coli ZnuA structure reveals the presence of a disulfide bond in the C-terminal globular domain that is not present in previously determined cluster 9 transport protein structures.

Introduction
Transition metal ions are essential cofactors for numerous proteins in all organisms. However, the requirement for metal cofactors has to be balanced with the toxicity of higher intracellular metal ion concentrations. In bacteria, metal homeostasis for ions such as Fe3+ , Mn2+ or Zn2+ is regulated by high and low-affinity metal efflux systems,1,2 highaffinity ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport systems,3 and low-affinity ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like Proteins) family transporters.4 Thus, the concentration of zinc ions in Escherichia coli is determined by the P-type zinc efflux ATPase ZntA,5,6 the cation difAbbreviations used: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; SBP, solute-binding protein.

fusion facilitator ZitB, 7,8 the high-affinity zinc transport system ZnuABC9,10 and the low-affinity ZIP family transporter ZupT.11,12 The metal specificity of these transporters as well as the regulation of bacterial zinc uptake in bacteria has recently been reviewed.13,14 Bacterial ABC-type metal ion transport systems consist of three proteins: a solute-binding protein (SBP), a transmembrane permease and a nucleotide-binding protein. The high-affinity zinc transport system consisting of the periplasmic SBP ZnuA, the ZnuB transmembrane permease and the ATPase ZnuC was identified in E. coli.9 Subsequent studies of ZnuA homologues in several pathogenic bacteria confirmed its critical function for zinc upake and demonstrated that ZnuA inactivation results in decreased virulence.15­17 Phylogenetic analysis placed the ZnuA SBP in a newly defined group (cluster 9) of ABC-type metal permeases, which also includes manganese-specific SBPs.18

Structure of ZnuA from Escherichia coli

1359 are given in Table 1. Subsequent chemical sequencing by trypsin digestion and tandem mass spectrometrical analysis confirmed the identity of the unknown protein as ZnuA (data not shown). There are two molecules of ZnuA in the asymmetric unit. The first residue in both protein chains is Ala45, which is consistent with cleavage of the Nterminal signal peptide by type I signal peptidase at the consensus "Ala-X-Ala" cleavage site.29 The structures of both molecules are very similar, with an overall root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.4 Å for all 262 C atoms. The following description is based on molecule A in our structural model. The overall structure of the protein is similar to other metal-binding transporters and consists of two (/)4 domains with the same topology that are connected by a long backbone helix and bind the metal ion at the interdomain interface (Figure 1(a)). Each domain consists of an all-parallel fourstranded -sheet with the strand sequence 2-1-3-4. The central -sheet is flanked by four -helices, two on each side. The -helices alternate with the strands in the primary sequence. The overall structures of both subdomains are similar, with an rmsd of 2.0 Å for 66 C residues. However, there are significant differences in the loop regions contributing to the metal-binding site as well as in the Cterminal helices that interact with the backbone helix. The backbone helix 5 connects the C-terminal helix 4 of the first domain with the N-terminal strand 5 of the second domain and stabilizes the relative orientation of the two globular domains by close interactions with the longer C-terminal helices 4 and 9 of both domains. Metal-binding site The metal-binding site in the ZnuA structure is located at the interface between both subdomains and contains a bound metal ion. To confirm the identity of this metal ion, we collected a singleTable 1. Data collection and refinement statistics

Structural information is currently available for four metal-specific SBPs. The structures of PsaA from Streptococcus pneumoniae,19 TroA from Treponema pallidum 20 and ZnuA from Synechocystis 6803 (ZnuA_syn)21 have been reported with bound Zn2+. The structure of TroA has also been determined in the metal-free conformation.22 In addition, the structure of MntC from Synechocystis 680323 has recently been determined with bound Mn2+. All four proteins belong to the cluster 9 family of SBPs and share the same overall fold. However, the organization of the metal-binding site is different for all structures and the significance of these structural variations for the metal-binding affinity and discrimination between zinc and manganese remain unclear. Here, we describe the X-ray crystal structure determination of ZnuA from E. coli (ZnuA_ec) with a bound zinc ion. The metal ion is coordinated by four residues (His78, His161, H225 and Glu77) in an unexpected arrangement, which was not predicted from sequence alignments with homologous SBPs. Therefore, the ZnuA_ec structure represents a new variation for metal coordination in a conserved structural framework.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure During protein purification experiments to isolate a poorly soluble, seleno-methionine labeled, recombinant protein, we noticed that a bacterial protein of approximately 35 kDa molecular mass consistently co-purified in significant amounts on a Ni-agarose affinity column. We collected fractions from a sizeexclusion chromatography run containing the unknown protein and set up crystallization experiments in parallel with the original protein target. The unknown protein crystallized readily and produced large and well-diffracting crystals. As the crystals were grown from seleno-methionine labeled protein, we collected an anomalous diffraction data set to 1.75 Å resolution and solved the structure by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion methods. For the structure solution, the program Solve24 located 13 selenium sites in space group P212121, and density modification with Resolve25 produced a high-quality experimental electron density map. Next, we assigned the protein sequence of a 28residue segment by manual inspection of the electron density in O.26 A protein sequence database search using BLAST27 identified ZnuA as the highest-ranked candidate for this 28-residue sequence. Using the full-length sequence of ZnuA, automated model building with Arp/wArp28 resulted in an almost complete model for residues 45 to 327. The fit of the initial model to the electron density map was verified with O and side-chain orientations and the N-terminal and C-terminal region were rebuilt manually.

In an anomalous difference Fourier map, two peaks were significantly higher than all other peaks and their positions corresponded with the metal ion positions in the two ZnuA molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1(b)). Overall, the metal-coordinated residues and the hydrogen-bonding residues in the second coordination shell form a hydrophilic environment that is

enclosed by an outer shell of hydrophobic residues (Figure 2(a)). The zinc ion is coordinated by three histidine residues (His78, His161, His225) and one glutamate (Glu77). The metal coordination by Glu77 is unexpected based on sequence alignments of cluster 9 SBPs and previous structure determinations (further discussed below). The histidine residues interact via their N2 atoms with the zinc ion, and the glutamate side-chain coordinates with the O2 oxygen (Figure 2(b)). The distances between the

1361 disulfide bond is not present in ZnuA_syn or the other metal-binding SBP structures currently available. However, equivalent cysteine residues are present in three other SBPs, ZnuA from Hemophilus ducreyi, ZnuA from Vibrio cholerae and Adh from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.18 In addition, the presence of a disulfide bond has been predicted based on sequence analysis in a study of the zinc-binding protein PZP1 from Hemophilus influenzae.31 Comparison with other metal-binding transport proteins As expected from sequence alignments, the overall structure of E. coli ZnuA is similar to other cluster 9 SBPs. A database search with the program Dali32 confirmed that the closest related structures are ZnuA_syn (Pdb code 1PQ4,21 rmsd 1.6 Å for 229 C, Figure 3(a)), MntC23 (Pdb code 1XVL, rmsd 1.7 Å for 231 C, Figure 3(c)), TroA20 (1.8 Å for 243 C, Figure 3(b)) and PsaA19 (1.8 Å for 232 C; PsaA is highly similar to MntC and is not shown in Figure 3). However, while the positions of secondary structure elements are consistent in all transporter structures, the loop regions contributing to the metal-binding site display unique conformations in each structure. Least-squares superposition of the ZnuA_ec metal-binding site with that of ZnuA_syn illustrates that Glu77 occupies the fourth metal-coordination site. This residue is unique in the E. coli protein and replaces a hydrophobic residue (proline or isoleucine) in the other structures (Figure 3(d)­(f)). Despite the unusual location of this residue, the coordinating oxygen atom is placed in a very similar position to the solvent water in ZnuA_syn (Figure 3(d)) or to the oxygen of Asp279 in TroA (Figure 3(e)) or Asp295 in MntC (Figure 3(f)). Despite the availability of several SBP structures, the structural determinants for discrimination between zinc and manganese remain under discussion. The first structures to be determined, PsaA and TroA, contained a bound zinc ion, but both proteins were thought to be manganese transporters. The structural data therefore suggested that these proteins do not discriminate between zinc and manganese. This problem was later resolved for the case of TroA when additional studies indicated that TroA is in fact a zinc-binding transport protein.33 One mechanism to discriminate between both metals would be to provide a tetrahedral coordination environment for zinc binding and a hexacoordinated state for manganese binding (discussed by Hantke14). However, additional structure determinations for ZnuA_syn and MntC showed that both zinc and manganese are bound in similar tetrahedral coordination states. Another discrimination mechanism was proposed based upon the ZnuA_syn structure. In this protein, zinc is surprisingly coordinated by three histidine residues and the fourth position is occupied by a solvent water molecule instead of a conserved aspartate residue

coordinating atoms and the zinc ion are 2.03 Å to His78, 2.05 Å to His161, 2.08 Å to His225, and 1.86 Å to Glu77 (4.0 Å to O1). The side-chain orientations of these coordinating residues are also determined by additional interactions with other residues or solvent water molecules. The N1 of His78 is oriented towards the entrance of the metalbinding site and coordinates to the solvent water W406 (2.74 Å), which is hydrogen-bonded to W319 (2.91 Å). N1 of His225 coordinates to O1 of Glu274 (2.78 Å) and Glu274 is positioned by interaction of its O2 with the hydroxyl group of Tyr228 (2.72 Å). In addition, O1 of Glu274 forms a hydrogen bond to the buried solvent water W1 (2.77 Å), and W1 connects to Q276 (2.81 Å) and W350 (2.69 Å), which in turn interacts with O1 of Glu77 (2.87 Å) and the hydroxyl group of Ser76 (2.63 Å). The buried solvent water molecules W1 and W350 thus form an interaction network between His225 and Glu77 in an otherwise hydrophobic pocket that is lined with Pro298, Leu299 and Phe277. Finally, the N1 of His161 is oriented towards the oxygen atom of Asn159, but the two atoms are located at a distance of 3.22 Å from each other in our model. In their study of ZnuA_syn,21 Banerjee et al. proposed that a flexible loop region can function as a metal-binding chaperone to enhance the binding affinity of the transporter. ZnuA_ec contains a similar inserted loop region (residues 136­ 156, Figure 1) that is also disordered in the crystal structure and was omitted from the final model. In both proteins, the loop is inserted in the N-terminal domain between 4 and 4. However, the E. coli loop insertion is considerably shorter, containing 21 residues as compared to 36 residues in Synechocystis. In our study, we observed that ZnuA binds efficiently to Ni-agarose beads. Inspection of the metal-binding site in the nickel-specific binding site in the NikA SBP30 illustrates that the nickel ion is bound in its hydrated form in a larger hydrophobic cavity. The observed binding of ZnuA to Ni-agarose beads is therefore more likely facilitated by the flexible loop region, which contains six histidine and eight aspartate residues within 21 residues. Interestingly, we could purify the ZnuA protein only from bacterial cultures grown in minimal LeMaster media, which suggests that the metalbinding site is empty during bacterial expression and that only metal-free protein binds to Ni-agarose beads. However, we think that this observation reflects the fact that ZnuA expression is upregulated in minimal media (containing only trace amounts of zinc) by its zinc-responsive regulator Zur10 and that the significantly higher amounts of protein present in these bacterial cultures lead to the observed ZnuA co-purification. Further Ni-agarose pull-down studies with a loop-deletion mutant protein will be required to confirm that the flexible loop region is required for nickel binding in ZnuA. Our ZnuA_ec structure determination revealed the presence of a disulfide bond between Cys270 and Cys234 connecting strand 8 with helix 9 in the C-terminal globular domain (Figure 1(a)). This

(Asp313 in ZnuA_syn) that binds to the metal ion in the other SBP structures. Banerjee et al. therefore proposed that zinc uptake might be preferred by reducing the number of coordinating residues.21 Our structure of ZnuA_ec now shows that the zinc ion is similarly not interacting with the aspartate (Asp297 in ZnuA_ec), but that it is again coordinated by four residues in a new structural variation of the zinc-binding site. A reduction in coordination number is therefore not conserved in the ZnuA proteins. To better understand the observed variations in metal coordinating residues, we performed a structure-based sequence alignment of all five available SBP structures (Figure 4) and further extended this analysis to include 42 homologous protein sequences (see Supplementary Data Figure S1 for full alignment). Within this sequence alignment, two groups can be observed among the ZnuA-related sequences that contain either a glutamate (such as ZnuA_ec) or a proline residue (such as ZnuA_syn) in the position of Glu77. In addition, the structure-based sequence alignment clearly shows that the position of the metalbinding aspartate residues is not conserved between the ZnuA proteins and other SBPs. In TroA, the metal-coordinating Asp279 is located in a loop

region between strand 8 and helix 9 in the Cterminal domain. Inspection of the hydrophobic core region of the C-terminal domain reveals two highly conserved residues, Tyr228 and Phe272 (in ZnuA_ec) that form a hydrophobic pocket that is filled by Leu296 (Figure 5). Tyr228 and Phe272 are conserved in all available structures, and the Leu296 position is occupied by either leucine or isoleucine (Figure 4). The extended sequence alignment shows that the position of Tyr228 is always an aromatic side-chain (Tyr, Phe, or Trp) and that the phenylalanine in the position of Phe272 is almost strictly conserved. The position of Leu296, finally, is occupied by a leucine in all ZnuA and TroA related sequences and by either leucine, isoleucine, or valine in the PsaA related sequences. From the sequence alignment, it can be seen that the aspartate residue in the ZnuAs is adjacent to the hydrophobic Leu296 and therefore located in a remote position from the metal center, whereas the aspartate residue in TroA, PsaA and MntC is actually an inserted residue in the third position after the hydrophobic leucine/isoleucine (Figure 5). Thus, the requirement to place a hydrophobic residue in the hydrophobic pocket of the core region between Tyr228 and Phe272 determines the position and metal-coordinating function of the following aspartate residue.

The comparison between the zinc and manganesespecific SBP structures therefore illustrates the following structural variations for metal-binding: In the zinc-specific ZnuAs and TroA, the metal is coordinated via three histidine residues and either no ligand or an aspartate (in TroA) or glutamate residue (in ZnuA_ec). The placement of the aspartate residue in TroA is related to PsaA and MntC, whereas the placement of the glutamate in the ZnuA_ec reported here represents a new variation among the zinc-binding SBPs. In the manganesespecific SBP structures, the metal is coordinated via two histidine residues, the third histidine is replaced

by a glutamate, and the fourth position is occupied by an aspartate in the same manner as in TroA. This pattern is conserved in the extended sequence alignment including 42 homologous sequences (Supplementary Data Figure S1). In summary, the crystal structure of ZnuA_ec reveals a new variation for metal-binding in the cluster 9 family of SBPs. Structural comparison of all available SBP structures shows that two histidine residues (His78 and His161 in ZnuA_ec) are strictly conserved in all proteins. The position of the third histidine residue in ZnuA_ec (His225) is either occupied by a histidine residue in the

X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC CCD detector at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source in Brookhaven. A selenomethionyl singlewave-length anomalous diffraction (SAD) data set to 1.75 Å resolution was collected at a wavelength of 0.9790 Å at 100 K. The diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL package.35 The crystals belong to the space group P212121, with cell dimensions of a = 73.0 Å, b = 88.0 Å and c = 86.7 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, giving a Vm of 2.2 Å3/Dalton. The data processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement Figure 5.

Comparison of the ZnuA_ec structure with ZnuA_syn now shows that the fourth metal-coordinating position is occupied by either a solvent water molecule or a glutamate or aspartate residue in the zinc-specific SBPs and by an aspartate residue in the manganese-specific SBPs.

Materials and Methods
Purification and crystallization of ZnuA ZnuA was purified from B834(DE3) cells (Novagen) grown in defined LeMaster media.34 Bacterial cells were lysed by ultrasonification on ice. ZnuA was bound to nickel-agarose affinity resin (Qiagen), washed with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.8), 250 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole. His-tagged protein was then eluted with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.8), 250 mM NaCl, and 150 mM imidazole. The protein was further purified with anion exchange chromatography at pH 8.8, using a linear gradient of 10 mM to 1 M NaCl concentration, and size-exclusion chromatography at pH 8.8 and 200 mM NaCl. The purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.8) and 10 mM NaCl. The sample was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without addition of cryo-protectant and stored at -80 °C. Crystals of ZnuA were obtained at 20 °C with the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350. The crystals were cryoprotected by rapid soaking in a solution containing mother liquor with the addition of 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 0.8 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm. A crystal with dimensions 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm was used for data collection.
