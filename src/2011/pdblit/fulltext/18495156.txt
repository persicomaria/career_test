A new esterase gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, reported to show homology with the mammalian hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)-like group of the esterase/lipase family, was cloned by means of the polymerase chain reaction from the A. fulgidus genome. In order to compare the biochemical properties of this putative hyperthermophilic enzyme with those of the homologous, thermophilic member of HSL group, namely Alicyclobacillus (formerly Bacillus) acidocaldarius esterase 2 (EST2), an overexpression system in Escherichia coli was established. The recombinant protein, expressed in soluble and active form at 20 mg/liter of E. coli culture, was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme, a 35.5-kDa monomeric protein, was demonstrated to be a B -type carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) on the basis of substrate specificity and the action of inhibitors. Among the p-nitrophenyl (PNP) esters tested the best substrate was PNP-hexanoate with K m and k cat values of 11 3 M (mean SD, n 3) and 1014 38 s 1 (mean SD, n 3), respectively, at 70°C and pH 7.1. Inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, diisopropylfosfofluoridate (DFP), and physostigmine, as well as labeling with [ 3H]DFP, supported our previous suggestion of a catalytic triad made up of Ser 160-His 285-Asp 255. The sequence identity with the thermostable A. acidocaldarius EST2 was

42.5%. The enzyme proved to be much more stable than its Alicyclobacillus counterpart. The conformational dynamics of the two proteins were investigated by frequency-domain fluorometry and anisotropy decay and the activity/stability/temperature relationship was discussed. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: carboxylesterase; thermostability; flexibility; Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius.

Esterases, lipases, and cholinesterases belong to a large family of phylogenetically related proteins with representatives in the domains of Eukarya and Bacteria which include proteins lacking of enzymatic activity (1, 2). Three subfamilies have been identified: the C group includes cholinesterases from vertebrate and invertebrate, lipases from fungi, several esterases, and some nonenzymic proteins; the group L includes lipases from vertebrate and bacteria, lipoprotein lipases, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferases, and related nonenzymatic vitellogenins from flies; the third group was named hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 2 by Hemila et al. (1), since these authors reported the ¨ cloning and sequencing of a gene from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius encoding a protein of unknown function

[open reading frame (ORF) 3], sharing sequence homology with the HSL from human and rat (3). We recently reported the purification of a new esterase from A. acidocaldarius and demonstrated its identity with the aforementioned ORF3. Moreover on the basis of secondary structure predictions and secondary structure-driven multisequences alignment with sequences of remote homologous proteins with known three-dimensional structure, we proposed for this enzyme the / hydrolase fold common to several esterases and lipases and identified Ser 155, Asp 252, and His 282 as putative members of the catalytic triad (4). The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized biochemically (5). A three-dimensional (3D) model was constructed and tested by sitedirected mutagenesis and affinity labeling (6). Crystals diffracting at 2.4 Å were obtained (7) and resolution of the 3D structure is currently underway. To the HSL group belong also: the N-acetylphosphino-thricintripeptide deacetylase from Streptomyces hygroscopicus (8); the acetylhydrolase from Streptomyces viridochromogenes (9); the lipase 2 from Moraxella TA144 (10); an esterase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (11); the esterase encoded by the ORF203 of E. coli, (12); Vsh5, a protein from the slime mold Dictiostelium discoideum (13), and the recently sequenced human liver arylacetamide deacetylase (14). Recently the complete sequencing of the A. fulgidus genome has been reported (15). Among its ORFs a gene homologous of the A. calcoaceticus esterase was identified (code: AF1716 at http://www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/afdb/afdb.html). By a multisequence alignment we aligned this hypothetical protein to the HSL group and predicted Ser 160, Asp 255, and His 285 as members of the catalytic triad (16). These predictions has been recently confirmed because the first 3D structure of a mesophilic member of the HSL group, the Bacillus subtilis Brefeldin A esterase, has been reported (17). Unfortunately, it is unclear at the moment whether the sequence similarity among these enzymes found in representatives of all domains of the life and adapted to different habitats implies comparable biochemical and physiological properties and the evolutive relationships among them. New enzymes from thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria could add new insights into the evolutive relationships from one hand and from the other they could allow fundamental studies in the field of protein stability for this class of proteins. Moreover stable carboxylesterases are giving rise to growing interest in the biotransformation field. To date, carboxylesterases have been purified and partially characterized only from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (18), Bacillus stearothermophilus (19 ­21), and A. acidocaldarius (4, 5, 22).

Here we report the cloning by PCR amplification of the gene from the Archaeoglobus fulgidus genome and its overexpression in E. coli. The recombinant protein was purified and demonstrated to be a thermostable and thermophilic carboxylesterase. Some biochemical and biophysical studies were done to gain further insights into the structure-function relationship of this interesting representative of the HSL group, especially in relation to the homologous thermophilic EST2. In particular the substrate specificity, the enantioselectivity and the thermal behaviour as well as the conformational dynamics of the two proteins were compared and discussed.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials. p-Nitrophenyl (PNP) esters, Fast Blue RR, and -naphthylacetate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Molecular mass markers for SDS­PAGE and for gel filtration chromatography were obtained from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). [ 3H]Diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DFP) (6 Ci/mmol) and [ 14C]Trioleoylglycerol (60 Ci/mol) were from Amersham. Strains and plasmids. E. coli Top 10 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was used as host for cloning, whereas E. coli BL21(DE3) harbored the recombinant plasmid for gene expression. The expression vector utilized was a derivative (pT7-SCII) of pT7 vector (23, 24). Cloning and overexpression. Standard molecular cloning techniques were employed throughout (25). E. coli cells [Top 10 or BL21(DE3)] were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin at 100 g/ml. Modification and restriction enzymes used in this work were from Promega and were used under the conditions recommended by the supplier. A 1032-bp fragment containing the entire ORF AF1716, was amplified using the A. fulgidus genomic DNA, a generous gift of Dr. D. Cowan, as template, recombinant Taq DNA polymerase, and oligonucleotides Afest5 (5 -GGGAAAGAGCATATGCTTGATATGCCAATCGACCCTG-3 ) and Afest3 (5 -GGCCATGAAGGCCTTGAGGGACCCTGACCTGCAGAAGGCC-3 ) as forward and reverse primers, respectively, in a 30-cycle PCR (1 min at 92°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C). The above amplification primers were designed to introduce NdeI and PstI restriction sites (underlined) upstream from the initiation site and downstream from the stop codon of AFEST ORF, respectively. The PCR product, eluted from an agarose gel and digested with NdeI and PstI, was ligated into the NdeI­PstI-linearized expression vector pT7-SCII to create the pT7SCII-GM2 construct. The cloned fragment was completely sequenced on both strands using the T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to verify that no undesired mutations were introduced during amplification. For protein expression the construct was transformed in BL21(DE3) cells and induction was started when culture reached an optical density of 1.8 units at 600 nm, by adding isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and continuing the incubation at 37°C for additional 3 h. For large scale protein production, 10 liters of LuriaBertani medium containing 100 g/ml of ampicillin were inoculated at 0.005 optical density ( A 600 nm) and grown overnight at 37°C with vigorous bubbling of steril air. The next day, after 3 h IPTG induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000g, 4°C, 15 min), washed with 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0)/2.5 mM MgCl 2/0.5 mM EDTA/1 mM DTT (buffer A), and stored at 70°C. Purification of the recombinant enzyme. All procedures were carried out at room temperature, unless indicated otherwise. Wet frozen cells (30 g) were thawed and resuspended in 150 ml (buffer A). Aliquots of 40 ml were broken by passing through a French pressure

MANCO ET AL. M), dissolved in 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, without detergents. Electrophoreses. Electrophoretic runs were performed with a Mini-Protean II cell unit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) at room temperature. SDS­PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (1970) (28). Gels (12.5% polyacrilamide) were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Serva). Molecular mass markers (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) were phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), -lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The molecular mass of the denatured enzyme was obtained by interpolation on a plot of log of molecular mass against relative migrations (R f values). Nondenaturing PAGE was performed at basic pH (separating gel, pH 8.8; running buffer, pH 8.3) with 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide slab gels. Reverse-phase HPLC. Protein purity was also checked by reverse-phase HPLC on a Pharmacia-LKB apparatus. Protein (20 g) was applied to the column (C 18; Aquapore RP 300, Brownlee) in 200 l of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid. Elution was performed with a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoracetic acid to 70% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. The absorption was monitored at 280 and 220 nm. Activity staining. Nondenaturing gels and SDS gels after protein renaturation, were stained for esterase activity as described (29). In brief, gels were incubated in a solution (100 ml) of 100 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mg of -naphtylacetate (predissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol) and 25 mg of Fast Blue RR at room temperature. Reactions were stopped after 15­30 min by rinsing with tap water and placing gels in 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid. Molecular mass determination by analytical gel filtration. Pure esterase (100 g) and protein markers (100 g) were chromatographed through a Zorbax GF 450 HPLC column (DuPont, Wilmington, DE). The equilibration and elution buffer was 25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.2, containing 300 mM NaCl, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. The molecular mass markers used were apoferritin (473 kDa), aldolase (160 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), carbonic anydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome C (12.6 kDa). Proteins were detected at 280 and 220 nm and esterase activity was measured by the standard assay. The esterase molecular mass was calculated by interpolation on a plot of log molecular mass against the V e/V o ratio. Active-site serine titration. Pure esterase (8 nmol in 0.5 ml of 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0) was titrated by addition of 36 l of [ 3H]DFP (6 Ci/mmol; 167 pmol/ l; 4.6 10 5 cpm/ l) and incubation at 37°C. Aliquots were withdrawn at times from the reaction mixture, and the residual activity was assayed by the standard assay. After complete (98%) inactivation the enzyme was separated from unreacted [ 3H]DFP by gel filtration through a column (20 0.5 cm) of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated and eluted with 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein eluted at the void volume was assayed by Bio-Rad protein assay and the coeluted radioactivity was measured by using a Packard Tri-Carb 300 liquid scintillation counter. An aliquot (5 g) of [ 3H]DFP-AFEST was subjected to SDS­PAGE. After run the gel was treated for fluorography as described (30). Thiol titration. Thiol group titration was performed with the Ellman's reagent as described (31). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed after protein separation by SDS­ PAGE and electrotransfer onto PVDF membrane ProBlott (Applied Biosystems), as described by Matsudaira (1987) (32). The band of interest was cut out and subjected to automated Edman degradation by an Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequencer (model 477 A) equipped with an on line 120 A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy. Circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) was performed on homogeneous samples of AFEST at concentrations 0.2 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.

cell apparatus (Aminco Co., Silver Spring, MD). A pressure setting of 2000 lb/in 2 (1.38 MPa) was used. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (80,000g, 30 min, 4°C). The crude extract after dilution 1:1 with buffer A was thermoprecipitated by incubation at 90°C for 10 min and clarification by centrifugation (17,000g, 30 min, 4°C). The pellet was discarded. The final enzyme solution was directly loaded onto an FPLC High-load Phenyl Sepharose column (20 3 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A, containing 10% (w/v) (NH 4) 2SO 4. After washing, a decreasing gradient of (NH 4) 2SO 4 (10% to 0%) was applied. Proteins were split into several peaks (a through f ) but activity was predominantly present in peak (b). Enzyme assays. The time course of the esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of PNP esters was followed by monitoring the production of p-nitrophenoxide at 405 nm in 1-cm pathlength cells with a doublebeam Varian Cary1E ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller (Varian) based on Peltiers heat-exchange devices. Initial rates were calculated by linear least-squares analysis of time courses comprising less than 10% of the total substrate turnover. The standard assay contained 0.2 mM PNP-hexanoate in 40 mM Na 2HPO 4/NaH 2PO 4/0.09% (w/v) arabic gum/0.36% (v/v) Triton X-100/2% (v/v) propan-2-ol (pH 7.1) at 70°C. Stock solutions of PNP esters were prepared by dissolving substrates in water, at their maximum of solubility (for kinetic measurements) or in propan-2-ol (for routine assays). The background hydrolysis of the substrate was deducted by using a reference sample of identical composition to the incubation mixture, except that esterase was omitted. One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of protein releasing 1 mol of p-nitrophenoxide/min from PNP ester at the indicated temperature. The absorption coefficients were measured at each indicated temperature and ranged over 14,000 ­21,000 M 1 cm 1. The pH was always adjusted for the appropriate working temperature. Lipase activity was assayed with [ 14C]trioleoylglycerol as described (26). The protein concentration measured with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay system, with BSA (Fraction V) as a standard, was found to be underestimated of 12% by amino acid composition analysis. Measures were corrected accordingly. Determination of pH optimum. The dependence of initial velocity on pH was monitored at 348 nm (the pH-independent isosbestic point of p-nitrophenol and the p-nitrophenoxide ion), using the extinction coefficient 5,300 M 1 cm 1, at 70°C. The buffer used 0.04 M Na 2HPO 4/NaH 2PO 4 over the range 5.6 ­ 8.4. pH values were adjusted at 70°C. Kinetic measurements. Initial velocity versus substrate concentration data were fitted to the Lineweaver­Burk transformation of the Michaelis­Menten equation, by weighted linear least-squares analysis using a personal computer and the GRAFIT program (27). Effect of inhibitors. Different concentrations of PMSF, physostigmine, and DPC were incubated with enzyme (21 g/ml) dissolved in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (for the inhibition by physostigmine and PMSF), and in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4 (for the inhibition by DPC), at 37°C for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by chilling on ice, and aliquots were assayed by the standard assay. Physostigmine and DFP are extremely toxic and were handled according to established safety regulations governing chemical materials. Thermostability and thermophilicity. The thermal stability of AFEST (0.225 mg/ml in 30 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) was studied over the range 58 ­95°C. After incubation in sealed glass tubes aliquots were assayed at 70°C by the standard assay. To calculate t/ 2 values experimental data points were computer fitted to an equation describing a single exponential decay with the program GRAFIT (27). The dependence of enzyme activity on temperature was studied over the range of 10 ­90°C, with PNP-hexanoate (90

EXPRESSION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A. fulgidus ESTERASE We used a J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with the Neslab RTE-110 temperature-controlled liquid system (Neslab Instruments, Portsmouth, NH) and calibrated with a standard solution of ( )-10-camphosulfonic acid. Sealed cuvettes with a 0.1-cm path length (Helma, Jamaica, NJ) were used in the far-UV region. Photomultiplier high voltage did not exceed 600 V in the spectral regions measured. Each spectrum was averaged five times and smoothed with Spectropolarimeter System Software, Version 1.00 (Jasco, Japan). All measurements were performed under nitrogen flow. Before undergoing CD analyses, all samples were kept at the temperature being studied for 6 min. The results are expressed in terms of residue molar ellipticity ( ). The percentages of secondary structures were estimated according to Yang's method (33). Fluorescence spectroscopy. Emission spectra were obtained with a Jasco FP777 spectrofluorometer, at a protein concentration 0.05 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The excitation was set at 298 nm in order to exclude the tyrosine contribution to the overall fluorescence emission. Frequency-domain measurements were performed using instrumentation described previously (34). The excitation source was a synchronously-pumped frequency-doubled rhodamine 6 G dye laser at 298 nm. The Trp emission was selected by a Corning 7-60 and 345 nm cut off filter. All intensity decay measurements were performed with magic angle polarized conditions. Temperature of the sample compartment was stabilized with the precision better than 0.5°C using Lauda RMT6 waterbath. Intensity decays were analyzed in terms of the multiexponential model, where i are the preexponential factors, i the decay times, and 1.0. i I t

The enantioselectivity of the enzyme was expressed as the enantiomeric ratio, E, which was obtained through the equation E ln[1 c(1 ee P)]/ln[1 c(1 ee P)], where c is the degree of conversion and ee P the enantiomeric excess of the product (41).

Cloning and Overexpression of AFEST in E. coli By searching the A. fulgidus genome for ORFs encoding putative esterases we identified the ORF AF1716 as a presumed esterase showing sequence similarity to the HSL subfamily of enzymes. The two aligned sequences are shown in Fig. 1. The sequence identity was 42% on an overlap of 309 residues. We cloned the gene by means of PCR amplification using two oligonucleotides at the amino and carboxyl terminal ends of the ORF, which also introduced, in the amplified fragment of 1032 bp, two unique restriction sites NdeI and PstI, respectively. The amplified DNA was double digested with NdeI and PstI and ligated into the expression vector pT7-SCII digested in the same way. The goal of this strategy was to put the gene under the control of the IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase through the T7 promoter 10 (Fig. 2). A clone was obtained expressing AFEST at 20 mg/l of E. coli culture after 3 h induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. The enzyme was completely associated with the cytosolic fraction of the crude extract (data not shown). Purification and Physical­Chemical Properties For the purification procedure (not shown) we took advantage from the high thermostability of the enzyme

where g k are fractional amplitudes and k the rotational correlation times, g k 1.0. The uncertainties in the differential phase ( ) and modulation ratios ( ) values were assumed to be 0.2 and m 0.005, respectively. Enzyme-catalyzed resolutions. The following racemic butyrates were subjected to enzymic hydrolysis (see Table III for structures): ( )-3-bromo-5-(hydroxymethyl)- 2-isoxazoline (1), ( )-3-hydroxymethyl-3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydro-benzo[d]isoxazole (2), ( )-3-hydroxymethyl-3a,5,6,7a-tetrahydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-d]isoxazole (3) and ( )-6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (4). The following procedure was adopted. The substrate (100 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (1 ml) and added to 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (10 ml), pH 7.0, containing the enzyme (11­35 g, depending on the substrate). The enzyme was stable in the reported conditions for several hours (results not shown). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for a scheduled time (15­ 45 min), depending on the substrate, extracted with ethyl acetate (3 10 ml), dried over sodium sulfate, and analyzed by chiral HPLC or GLC to determine the

by using as a first purification step a thermoprecipitation at 90°C. A hydrophobic chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose followed. The enzyme was purified with a 84% total yield and a purification factor of eightfold in peak (b) (see Experimental Procedures) in which the enzyme was more than 95% pure. This means that AFEST represents 12.5% of the total soluble E. coli proteins. Purity was assessed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Pharmacia-LKB apparatus (purity 98%), Nterminal sequencing and SDS­PAGE. The recombinant protein started with a methionine and the unique detected sequence was: MLDMPIDPVYYQLAEY, which was identical to that deduced from the DNA sequence. The final specific activity was approx. 3000 U/mg at 80°C using the standard assay. The specific activity is comparable with that displayed from the A. acidocaldarius EST2 we recently purified and characterized (4, 5). This and the aforementioned high thermostability (see below) suggest that the enzyme is correctly folded as also indicated by the far-UV CD spectrum of the recombinant protein (Fig. 3). The CD data, elaborated according to Yang's method (33) ( 42%; 15%; turn 19%; random 24%) were in fairly good agreement with data obtained from the secondary structure predictions ( 44%; 21%; rest 34%) using the PHD server (42), especially for the -helix content. The apparent molecular mass of the unique band observed on SDS­PAGE 12.5% T (Fig. 4, lanes a

and b), was 33.8 kDa. The band was slightly active after SDS removal and activity staining in situ (not shown) and it was [ 3H]DFP-reactive (lane c). In a nondenaturing PAGE (lane d) a single band was observed migrating more slowly than A. acidocaldarius EST2. A gel electrofocusing (not shown) was carried out on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing ampholines in the pH range 3­10 (Bio-Rad). The calculated isoelectric point was approximately 6, whereas the theoretical one is 5. The apparent molecular mass of the enzyme in nondenaturing conditions was determined by gel filtration on an HPLC apparatus using a Zorbax GF 450 column. A value of 43,000 daltons was estimated by interpolation on a calibration curve (data not shown). This and the above findings are consistent with a monomeric enzyme. Kinetic Studies The optimal pH was determined at 70°C with PNPhexanoate (C6) as a substrate. The enzyme had a broad optimal pH between 6.5 and 7.5 and it was routinely assayed at pH 7.1. Table I displays k cat and K m values for the hydrolysis of PNP esters with acyl chain length of 3­ 8, at 70°C.

low. However no lipase activity was detected by using [ 14C]trioleoylglycerol as substrate in an emulsion of arabic gum and BSA. The results obtained in the esterase catalysed resolution of some racemic alcohols of interest in the pharmaceutical or pheromone field (37­ 40) are summarised in Table II. The enzyme was very effective as a catalyst and significant conversions were achieved in short reaction periods and with high substrate/enzyme ratios. However, a modest enantioselectivity was observed only in the resolution of compound 4, where the (R)product was obtained with a 60% enantiomeric excess at 39% conversion. The enantiomeric ratio values were low and ranged between 0 and 6. Inhibitors, Active Site, and Thiol Titration The effect of some inhibitors are shown in Fig. 5. The enzyme was almost completely inhibited by PMSF (2.8% of residual activity with 0.08 mM of inhibitor) and physostigmine, a carbamate-type inhibitor (4% of residual activity with 0.1 mM of inhibitor) in the applied conditions. [ 3H]DFP gave inhibition kinetics similar to PMSF (not shown). The inhibition was essentially irreversible as judged by the activity assay of the enzyme after gel filtration and by the stability of the [ 3H]DFP labeled enzyme to SDS­PAGE conditions (Fig. 4, lane c).

For the substrate PNP-hexanoate with the higher specificity constant (k cat/K m), K m and k cat values measured at 70°C gave values of 11 3 M (mean SD, n 3) and 1014 38 s 1 (mean SD, n 3), respectively. The activity toward longer PNP esters (C 12 and C 16), in the standard assay, proved detectable, albeit very

The reactions were stopped by chilling on ice, and aliquots were assayed by the standard assay.

enzyme (6.2% residual activity with 1.5 mM), suggesting the involvement of a histidine at the active site. Taken together, these data suggest that this esterase might contain a triad Ser-His-Asp/Glu similar to that reported for the active site of serine protease or for lipase. To determine the number of active sites per molecule of the enzyme, a known amount of pure protein was titrated with [ 3H]DFP, as described under Experimental Procedures. Assuming a molecular mass of 35,500 daltons as deduced from the sequence, 1 mol of [ 3H]DFP was required to titrate 1 mol of the enzyme. By sequence comparison (Fig. 1) we noticed that out of the three cysteine residues of AFEST, Cys 102 corresponds to the single cysteine residue, namely Cys 97 of EST2. We wondered whether these residues were exposed to the solvent or involved in enzyme activity. The Ellmann's reagent, as described under Experimental section, was used to titrate the thiol groups under native conditions. A single exposed cysteine residue was estimated based on a protein molecular mass of 35,500 and a molar absorptivity of 13,600 M 1 cm 1 at 412 nM for the 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion. The activity of modified enzyme in the standard assay was found to be 70% reduced respect to the control. Two additional cysteine residues were only detected after incubation of the protein in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride. Thermophilicity and Thermostability The relationship between activity and temperature over the range 10 ­90°C was obtained using PNP-hexanoate as a substrate. The optimal temperature was

found to be 80°C (Fig. 6A). An energy activation value of 26 KJ/mol (6.35 Kcal/mol) was estimated from the linear part of the Arrhenius plot over the range 10 ­ 80°C (Fig. 6B). The esterase thermostability was studied by measuring the residual activity after incubation for different period at temperatures ranging between 58 ­95°C. Figure 7 shows for each temperature tested the comparison with EST2, a thermostable carboxylesterase from the thermoacidophilic eubacterium A. acidocaldarius we previously characterized (20). At 85°C the t 1/ 2 for AFEST and EST2 were 60 and 24 min (Fig. 7A); at 90°C 28 and 18 min (Fig. 7B); and at 95°C 26 and 3.5 min (Fig. 7C), respectively. At 58 and 70°C t/ 2 values for AFEST were 30 and 7.5 h, respectively (not shown).

FIG. 8. Frequency domain fluorometry of EST2 and AFEST at 25°C. Frequency dependence of the phase shift and demodulation factors of EST2 and AFEST fluorescence emission at 25°C. Excitation was at 298 nm and the absorbance of the enzyme solutions was below 0.1 at the excitation wavelength.

Fluorescence Analysis In order to analyze the structural flexibility/activity/ stability relationship in the two enzymes we exploited their intrinsic tryptophanyl fluorescence. EST2 and AFEST possess 4 and 3 tryptophan residues, respectively, with two of them conserved between sequences as shown in the alignment of Fig. 1. The fluorescence emission spectra of AFEST and EST2, at 25°C show an emission maximum at 340 and 338 nm, respectively. In both cases, the position of the emission maximum is blue-shifted with respect to the emission maximum of N-acetyltryptophanylamide (NATA) centered at 348 nm, suggesting that the tryptophanyl residues of both enzymes are embedded in buried and/or unrelaxed microenvironments (43).

The tryptophanyl emission decay properties of AFEST and EST2 at 25°C were investigated by frequency domain fluorometry (Fig. 8). The phase shifts and modulation factors were collected upon excitation at 298 nm to exclude tyrosine contribution to the whole emission. The data were analysed in terms of multiexponential model. Table III shows the multiexponential analysis of the intensity decay of AFEST and EST2 at 25°C. The best fits were obtained using the three exponential models, characterized by chi-square values that were much lower than those obtained with the other fits (data not shown). The reported results indicate that at 25°C the two proteins show a different degree of structural flexibility; in particular, the data indicate that EST2 possess a more dynamic and/or solvent-exposed structure. Frequency domain fluorescence anisotropy decays of AFEST and EST2 at 25°C are depicted in Fig. 9. At low modulation frequencies, the modulation anisotropy for EST2 is much lower than for AFEST. However, we should state that the fluorescence lifetime of the tryptophan residues is too short in order to gain information about the overall rotation motion of the proteins ( 34 kDa). The anisotropy data show that the motion of the fluorophores on the time-scale of the tryptophanyl emission is more restricted for AFEST than for EST2. However, for both enzymes the modulation anisotropy at high frequencies is almost the same and lower than the expected value of r 0 0.29 reported for Trp excited at 298 nm (43). This indicates that the tryptophanyl fluorescence emission from both enzymes undergoes to a fast initial unresolved depolarization of about the same extent, probably as consequence of a local motion of the fluorophores. Results of the doublecorrelation time analysis of the data from Fig. 9 are summarized in Table IV. The correlation times for AFEST were found to be longer than correlation times for EST2, supporting the evidence that the structure of EST2 is more flexible than the AFEST structure at 25°C.

DISCUSSION

An efficient overexpression system of the AF1716 gene was devised in E. coli and biochemical studies on the recombinant thermostable enzyme were performed. As described under Results, high level expression was attained after 3 h of IPTG induction and the enzyme was easily purified to homogeneity by taking advantage of its thermostability. As inferred from SDS­PAGE, gel permeation chromatography and titration of the active site with [ 3H]DFP, the enzyme proved to be a monomer with a single active center, similar to the EST1 and EST2 we previously purified from A. acidocaldarius (4, 5, 22). The profile of substrate specificity shown in Table I suggests the presence at the active site of a hydrophobic binding pocket able to accommodate optimally short- and medium-length acyl chains. However, long chain esters (C12 and C16) were hydrolyzed as well, albeit at a lower rate. The profile is quite similar to that obtained for A. acidocaldarius EST2 (5). The AFEST enzyme is similar to EST2 in a number of other features such as optimal pH, DFP sensitivity and the apparent molecular mass but, as expected, appears different as far as thermophilicity and thermostability are concerned. The fact that the two enzymes share many features and are practically colinear in sequence and yet are derived from organisms in different domains of life is noteworthy, since it speaks of the probable gene trans-

fer that may account for the similarity. This suggestion is also supported by the consideration that the gene is absent from the genome of the other completely sequenced archaea (thermophilic or not) whereas homologous genes are present in several eubacterial genomes and yet is absent from the genome of the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima, which has been reported to have a high degree of genes with similarity to archaeal genes (44). The AFEST's activity/temperature relationship was investigated in terms of Arrhenius plots. AFEST displayed optimal activity at 80°C (Fig. 6A) corresponding fairly well to the A. fulgidus optimal growth temperature (83°C). The Arrhenius plot (Fig. 6B) was linear over the range 10 ­ 80°C, thus no change in activation energy was observed; beyond 80°C enzyme activity decreased but this was unlikely to be due to denaturation as suggested by stability measurements (Fig. 7) and changes in the spectroscopic behaviour of the enzyme (unpublished). Thus, unlike other thermophilic enzymes which are inactive even at room temperature or, if not, are only marginally active, AFEST was still detectable at 10°C (with approximately 10% of the activity at 80°C). Moreover AFEST displayed k cat values lower than its Alicyclobacillus counterpart (about sixfold at 70°C (5)), even if the comparison was made at the respective optimal temperatures. According with current opinion this difference could be ascribed to the higher thermostability of AFEST respect to EST2, which could make the AFEST protein more rigid (45). In order to shed some light on this aspect experiments of frequency domain fluorometry and anisotropy decay were performed. The reported results (see Tables III and IV) indicate that at 25°C the two proteins show a different degree of structural flexibility; in particular, the data indicate that EST2 possesses a more dynamic and/or solventexposed structure. The analysis at 25°C was legitimate from the fact that as for EST2 (5), the Arrhenius plot was linear and the downward curvature at low temperature observed for several thermostable enzymes (46 and references therein) and generally interpreted as due to the lower conformational flexibility (45, 47),

was not detected. Moreover the E a values for the two enzymes were similar (6.35 and 7.44 kcal/mol for AFEST and EST2, respectively). A comparative analysis of flexibility at different temperatures is, however, necessary and will be argument of future work as well as the comparison of the two 3D structures with that of the mesophilic counterpart (17). The inhibitory effect of DFP, physostigmine, PMSF, and DPC (Fig. 5) suggested the involvement of a serine residue and a histidine residue at the active site. These results give further support to the previously made prediction of a "catalytic triad" composed of Ser 160, His 285, and Asp 255 (22). We have recently mutated the latter two residues in the homologous A. acidocaldarius EST2, demonstrating their involvement in the esterase activity (6). Moreover recently the 3D structure of a member of the HSL group has been solved (17) confirming our predictions. On the basis of both the substrate specificity (Table I) and the sensitivity to carbamate and organophosphate-type inhibitors (Fig. 5), AFEST should be classified according to Oosterbaan and Jansz (1965) (48) as a B -type carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1). 3 By sequence inspection we noticed that one out of the three cysteine residues in AFEST, namely Cys 102, corresponds to the single cysteine (Cys 97) existing in EST2 which was previously demonstrated to be exposed and not involved in the enzyme activity (5). The titration with the Ellman's reagent suggested that in AFEST there is a single cysteine with similar accessibility since in native condition only one thiol group was titrated out of three. However, in contrast with EST2 the activity was substantially reduced after this single thiol titration. The remaining two groups were only available to the titrant after addition of 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride indicating that they are buried. Thus the available data do not permit to conclude that Cys 102 of AFEST has the same topological position of Cys 97 of EST2. From a biotechnological standpoint there is only a marginal difference between esterases and lipases as these enzymes are interchangeable in the majority of biotranformations. The constant academic and industrial interest in enzymes with new properties for synthetic purposes, prompted us to investigate the enantioselectivity of AFEST. Butyryl esters of several alcohols of interest in the pharmaceutical and pheromone field (37­ 40) were tested. Substantial enantioselectivity was only observed in the resolution of compound 4, where the (R)-product was obtained with a 60% enantiomeric excess at 36% conversion (Table II). It should be emphasised that the enantiomeric ratio is equal to
3 Enzymes. Carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1); Triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3).

the ratio between the specificity constant of the enzyme for one enantiomer and that of the other enantiomer. This biochemical constant is independent of time, conversion and substrate concentration (41). Compared with EST2 the enantioselectivity is quite modest. Moreover AFEST showed the best enantioselectivity for compound 4 in contrast with EST2 (5) for which the enantioselectivity was better for compound 1. The structural basis for the observed difference is at present unknown and in order to be elucidated it will require the comparison of enzyme structures, better if complexed with transition-state analogues. In fact has been reported, by crystallographic and molecular-modeling studies that small differences afforded by a few amino acid substitutions, are able to affect largely the enzyme enantioselectivity (49, 50). To address further this point a larger set of substrates requires investigation. Furthermore, protein engineering through sitedirected and random mutagenesis as well as medium engineering might also be systematically explored. Finally, the thermal behavior of these enzymes, such as high thermostability coupled with high activity at mesophilic temperatures make them excellent model systems to explore enzymatic properties in nonconventional conditions. Again the large amount of the pure protein obtained will permit the crystallisation of the enzyme in order to compare its tertiary structure with those of thermophilic and mesophilic companions with the ultimate goal to understand the molecular mechanisms that are at basis of the thermostability of these enzymes.
