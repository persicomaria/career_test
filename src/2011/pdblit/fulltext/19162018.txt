Spherical Wave Analysis of EXAFS Data Including Multiple Scattering

Introduction It is apparent that EXAFS analyses of data are greatly improved in accuracy if a spherical- rather than plane-wave theory is employed. Inclusion of multiple scattering into the EXAFS analysis recently has been advanced by Gurman, Binsted, and Ross,' who have derived the exact spherical wave double and triple scattering terms for a three atom randomly oriented sample. However, evaluation of these temls provides a computational burden for routine application of the theory. An alternative approach to multiple scattering uses Rehr's high energy asymptotic formulation that promises to be a rapidly evaluated and accurate approximation to the exact theory'. We report results of an implementation of this theory with selected examples of transition metal complex and metalloenzyme EXAFS. Computational Approach and Results

Atomic potentials are generated from central atom configuration containing a 1s hole and either two or three valence holes; neutral atoms are used for the low Z ligand atoms. Phase shifts are calculated from the potentials with inclusion of the energy-dependent Dirac-Hara exchange potential. While backscattering phases are relatively insensitive to the muffin-tin radius, forward or near-forward scattering requires use of overlapping spheres, and a muffin tin radius of 1.19 8, is employed so as to enclose ca. 90% of the atomic charge density. Phase shifts to f=25 are used. Single scattering is calculated with the exact spherical-wave theory. The key assumption in the multiple scattering approximation (SWA) is retention of only m=O terms in the expansion of G,_,,_,. Thus the multiple scattering tern1 for the path with legs R,, R?..R, is

We include double and triple scattering terms for three atoms. The k-dependent mean-free path h is obtained from the "universal" curve and a core-hole lifetime is included. Only one overall (r' is employed. ,X Figure 1 compares the exact and SWA Y results for the net double scattering contributions from the six paths in a copper-imidazole( Im) fragment: the agreement is excellent and tmd computational time is reduced by a factor of l/X() using the SWA. Least-squares fitting of experimental data from Cu( Im),(NO,), at 80 K (Fig. 2a) leads to the results (talc; exp) in A: lsh (2.00: 2.01), 2sh (2.95, 3.05; 2.94, 3.04), 3sh (4.17,4.34; 4.14,4.19). To obtain the best fit axial oxygen atoms are needed. A (J' of 0.002 A2 is found by fitting and compares well to an experimentally determined value of 0.003 A2 in Ni(lm),Cl, at X0 K. Co(Im),(NO,), is an octahedral complex and the simulation shown in Fig. 2b leads to 1sh (2.14; 2.16), 2sh (3.04, 3.18; 3.12, 3.23), 3sh (4.31, 4.50; 4.29, 4.37). The third shell C distance is in error by 0.13 8, (($1 the copper complex). A o2 = 0.0055 A" reproduces cr' = 0.006 8' found "X Y experimentally at 300 K in the nickel complex. An example of a mixed ligand complex is the Mg salt of (N,N'-ethylenebis-(o-hydroxyphenylglycine) iron (III) (FeEHPG). The fitted (Fig. 2c) values for first-shell distances are 2.19, 2.03, and 1.92 8, for Fe-N, Fe-O(carboxylate), and Fe-O(phenolate), respectively, as compared to averaged pairs of crystallographic bond distances of 2.16, 2.04, and 1.91 A. Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase from P. ueru,yinosu contains a non-heme iron active site. Previous EXAFS, XAS, resonance Raman, nmr, and epr results3.' have suggested that two histidine and two

tyrosine are metal ligands with at least one water or hydroxide ligand. By using the analysis described here (Fig. 2d), we find that the iron is five-coordinate7 with first-shell distances of 1.93 (Fe-O(Tyr)), 2.14-2.16 (Fe-N(His)), and 1.93 8, (Fe-O(OH- )); the short iron-water distance favors assignment to a hydroxo ligand. The recent crystallographic study of a protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase confirms the spectroscopically determined amino acid residues and in the initial model one solvent molecule occupies the fifth site*. Under anaerobic conditions the enzyme-substrate complex is stable and its EXAFS spectrum with simulation is shown in Fig. 2e. The first-shell distances are found as 1.97- 1.99 Fe-O(protocatechuate), 1.92-l .93 Fe-O(Tyr), and 2.10 8, (Fe-N(His)). No evidence is found during refinement for asymmetrical binding of the substrate or for monodentate binding. The substrate is a chelator in this enzyme. Conclusions A combination of an exact spherical-wave single scattering treatment and Rehr's SWA for multiple scattering yields accurate simulations for a variety of transition metal complexes at a marked increase in computational speed when compared to exact multiple scattering formulations. Forward scattering paths require the use of overlapping muffin tin radii. The EXAFS fitting appears to yield accurate first shell distances, even in mixed ligand complexes. Accuracy decreases in more distant shells exhibiting multiple scattering enhancement.
