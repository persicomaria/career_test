ABSTRACT Proteolytic activity is an important virulence factor for Candida albicans (C. albicans). It is attributed to the family of the secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) from C. albicans with a minimum of 10 members. Saps show controlled expression and regulation for the individual stages of the infection process. Distinct isoenzymes can be responsible for adherence and tissue damage of local infections, while others cause systemic diseases. Earlier, only the structures of Sap2 and Sap3 were known. In our research, we have now succeeded in solving the X-ray crystal structures of the apoenzyme of Sap1 and Sap5 in ∞ complex with pepstatin A at 2.05 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. With the structure of Sap1, we have completed the set of structures of isoenzyme subgroup Sap1-3. Of subgroup Sap4-6, the structure of the enzyme Sap5 is the first structure that has been described up to now. This facilitates comparison of structural details as well as inhibitor binding modes among the different subgroup members. Structural analysis reveals a highly conserved overall secondary structure of Sap1-3 and Sap5. However, Sap5 clearly differs from Sap1-3 by its electrostatic overall charge as well as through structural conformation of its entrance to the active site cleft. Design of inhibitors specific for Sap5 should concentrate on the S4 and S3 pockets, which significantly differ from Sap1-3 in size and electrostatic charge. Both Sap1 and Sap5 seem to play a major part in superficial Candida infections. Determination of the isoenzymes' structures can contribute to the development of new Sap-specific inhibitors for the treatment of superficial infections with a structurebased drug design program.

INTRODUCTION Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a commensal organism and part of the normal human microflora in $50% of the population.1 Although yeast is usually harmless in healthy individuals, it can turn into a pathogen triggering life-threatening infection in immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Proteolytic activity is known as an important virulence factor of C. albicans.1,2 It is attributed to the secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) of C. albicans with a minimum of 10 members. Sap1-8 are secreted into the extracellular space, whereas Sap910 are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane-bound proteins. The importance of Saps was detected by using Sap inhibitors like pepstatin A (pep A) during wild type infection and based on the construction of certain SAP null mutants.3≠5 Deletion of C. albicans SAP genes (knock-out) resulted in less virulent strains which were found in mice and guinea pig models.6 The panel of 10 different Sap isoenzymes facilitates adaptation of the yeast to many possible host niches, enabling C. albicans to cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. The Saps undergo controlled expression and regulation depending on the individual stages of the infection process. Certain Saps can be particularly important for adherence and tissue damage in localized infections and others in systemic diseases.7≠9 Sap9-10 are also necessary for adherence, cell surface integrity, and cell separation.10 Several studies have proved the significant role of Sap1 and Sap 5 for virulence during local and systemic C. albicans infections.

switching strain WO-1, in which white-phase cells misexpressed the opaque-specific gene SAP1, Kvaal et al.11 proved that SAP1 caused a dramatic increase in cutaneous infection probably as a result of increased adherence to and ``cavitation'' of the skin. Recently, the role of Sap5 for the invasion of epithelial tissues was demonstrated in a three-dimensional model of the human oral mucosa. The authors showed that an invasion-deficient rim101-/ rim101-strain had been severely restrained in its ability to express SAP4, SAP5, and SAP6 genes. However, engineered expression of SAP5 in this mutant restored invasion in the mucosal model.12 Mutants lacking Sap1 to Sap3 were only moderately attenuated during disseminated infections of mice and guinea pigs which were infected intravenously with the mutants.4 In the case of the sap3 mutant, this may partially be due to a URA3 position effect. Expression of URA3 can influence the virulence phenotypes and proteome of C. albicans but can be overcome by targeted reintegration of URA3 at the RPS10 locus. A more noticeable decrease in virulence was monitored for the SAP4 to SAP6 deleted mutant.5 PepA, the classical aspartic proteinase inhibitor, showed a protective effect against C. albicans infections in mice.13,14 However, pepA did not protect against C. albicans when injected intravenously.13 In addition, pepA is slightly toxic for animals.15 In vitro, similar binding affinities for pepA to Sap1, Sap2, and Sap3 have been found, as reflected by Ki values being 15, 17 (or IC50 27 nM16), and 60 nM, respectively.17 The HIV proteinase inhibitors such as ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir, which are part of the highly active anti retroviral therapy (HAART) used in AIDS therapy today, have been associated with the clinical resolution of oral candidiosis.18 Korting et al.19 demonstrated the attenuation of tissue damage by saquinavir using a reconstituted human epithelium (RHE) model of oral candidosis. It has been shown by several in vitro studies that HIV proteinase inhibitors are active against Sap isoenzymes in the micromolar range.19≠22 A significant inhibition of enzyme activity was observed for Sap 1-3, while almost no inhibitory effect of the HIV protease inhibitors could be detected for Sap 4-6. Since current medical mycology focuses on substances that interfere with virulence factors rather than with cell structures,23≠25 effective Sap inhibitors can become an attractive therapeutic option.6 Crucial for Sap-specific inhibitor design are the exact enzyme structure models, which so far have only been known for Sap2 and Sap3 in C. albicans.26≠28 We report the X-ray crystal structures of the apoenzymes Sap1 and Sap5 in complex with pepA at 2.05 and ∞ 2.5 A resolutions. With the structure of Sap1, we have completed the set of structures of subgroup Sap1-3. Of subgroup Sap 4-6, the structure of the enzyme Sap5 is the first structure that has been described up to now.

This makes a comparison of structural details and inhibitor binding modes among the different subgroup members possible. Thus, we analyzed the structures of Sap1 and Sap5 in the context of the known structures of Sap2 and Sap3. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression of the Sap isoenzymes in Pichia pastoris

Both, Sap1 and Sap5 were expressed as recombinant proteins using the Pichia pastoris expression system.29 P. pastoris transformants were cultured to cell densities near saturation (OD600 5 20) at 308C in 1000 mL of glycerol-based yeast media [0.1M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0, containing 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 1.34% (w/v) YNB without amino acids (Difco, Sparks, USA), 1% (w/v) glycerol, and 4 3 1025% (w/v) biotin]. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 200 mL of the same medium containing 0.5% (w/v) methanol instead of glycerol and were incubated for 2 days. Thereafter, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation.
Purification of recombinant proteinases

Four hundred milliliter of Pichia pastoris culture supernatant of both Sap1 and Sap5 was concentrated to 100 mL using an Amicon-stirred ultrafiltration cell (10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), Millipore, Billerica, MA).
Purification of Sap1

For desalting, the concentrate of Sap1 was dialyzed against a 100-fold volume of 10 mM citric acid/NaOH (pH 5.5). Sap1 was first purified by anion-exchange. The dialyzed solution was loaded on a DEAE-column (DE 52, Whatman1, Middlesex, UK), washed with 10 mM citric acid/NaOH (pH 5.5) and eluted with a gradient running from 10 to 100 mM citric acid/NaOH at the same pH. Pooled fractions were concentrated to a volume of 1.0 mL and further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 prep grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) with 10 mM citric acid/NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 150 mM NaCl. Finally, the protein was transferred into 10 mM 2-(Nmorpholine)-ethane sulphonic acid (MES)/NaOH (pH 6.5) via a NapTM10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Purification of Sap5

Sap5 was dialyzed--after concentration to about 100 mL--against 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.0) and purified on CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia BioPROTEINS

tech). The loaded sample was washed with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.0) and eluted with a gradient from 10 mM sodium citrate buffer to 300 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.0). Pooled fractions were concentrated to a volume of 1.0 mL and for further purification run over a gel filtrationcolumn (Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 prep grade (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a 10 mM sodium citrate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.0). Protein recovered from gel filtration was finally buffer-exchanged to 10 mM MES buffer (pH 6.5) by passing through NapTM10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Protein extract analysis

and 0 nM for 60 min at room temperature. After adding substrate solution, the mixture was incubated at 378C for another 60 min. The undigested substrate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration) and separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The fluorescence of the supernatant was measured in the alkaline range at 530 nm (excitation) and 590 nm (emission) after adding 100 lL 1M Tris/HCl (pH 10.0).
Crystallization

Protein concentrations were calculated from the absorption of protein at 280 nm (OD280) by using the extinction coefficient (Abs 0.1% at 280 nM 5 0.765 M21/cm for Sap1 and 1.05 M21/cm for Sap5, respectively) as given in Expasy-ProtParam Tool. Protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE30 with a separation gel of 12% polyacrylamide. Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany).
Peptide mass fingerprinting

Samples recovered from buffer exchange were concentrated to about 10 mg/mL using Centricon 10 filtration units (Millipore). Pepstatin A (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) was added to samples of Sap5 in a 1.5-fold molar excess. Sap1 apoenzyme crystallized in the presence of a buffer containing either 14 or 16% PEG 20,000 and 0.1M MES/NaOH (pH 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, or 6.7, respectively). Sap5 in complex with pepstatin A formed crystals in the presence of reservoir buffer containing a mixture of 10% PEG 8000, 8% ethylene glycol, and 0.1M HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5). The crystals of Sap1 grew within a few days, whereas the crystals of Sap5 appeared overnight. Sap1 and Sap5 crystals reached full size within several weeks.
Data collection, structure solution, and refinement

The identity of Sap1 and Sap5 was confirmed by its peptide mass fingerprint. The putative band in SDSPAGE containing the respective protein was analyzed by enzymatic tryptase digestion followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Measured peptide masses were compared with peptide masses from an in silico digestion of the protein database using the search engine MASCOT.
Activity assay

The proteolytic activity of both isoenzymes was measured with 0.02% resorufin-labeled casein as substrate at the pH optimum in citric acid/NaOH (50 mM citric acid/NaOH, pH 4.5 and 5.0, respectively)29 in a total volume of 0.1 mL. After incubation at 378C for 30 min, the undigested substrate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration) and separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured in the alkaline range at 574 nm after addition of 100 lL 1M Tris/HCl (pH 10.0).
Determination of IC50 of pepstatin A for Sap5

Proteolytic activity of Sap5 was measured at pH 5.0 as described earlier. However, reflecting the higher sensitivity, fluorescence instead of absorption of resorufin was detected. Optimal incubation of resorufin-labeled casein was determined in a range of 15≠75 min at first. Thereafter, Sap5 (5 nM final concentration) was incubated with pepA at a final concentration of 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1,

X-ray data were collected after shock freezing the crystals under a stream of nitrogen at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream, Oxford, UK, using synchrotron radiation at the beamline BW6 of the DESY (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany) by using a Mar Research CCD detector (Mar Research, Hamburg, Germany). Two complete native data sets in the resolution ∞ ∞ range of 30.00≠2.05 A (Sap1) and 30.00≠2.5 A (Sap5) were collected using X-ray radiation with a wavelength of ∞ 1.05 A. The crystal of Sap1 was of space group C2, while Sap5 had space group P41212. Both crystals contained two molecules per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data was processed and scaled with the programs DENZO/SCALEPACK.31 Models were built with the modeling program O.32 Statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table I. Sap1 was solved by molecular replacement with the program Phaser.33 The structure of Sap2X (PDB Code: 1ZAP27) served as a search model. The calculation of the electron density map and the crystallographic refinement were performed using CNS.34 Six hundred fifty-five water molecules were automatically built with CNS34 and pepA was built into the extra density along the active site cleft. The model of the Sap1 apoenzyme was refined ∞ to 2.05 A to a final Rfree of 22.4% and an R-factor of 18.9%. The model of Sap2X was again used as a search model for molecular replacement by Phaser33 in order to solve the structure of Sap5. Refinement of this model was per-

Three hundred seventy water molecules were automatically built with CNS.34 Refinement was performed to 2.5 ∞ A to a final Rfree of 27.5% and an R-factor of 22.4%. The main-chain angles of the refined structures were analyzed by the program PROCHECK35 and plotted in a Ramachandran diagram.36 Accordingly, 99.3% of all mainchain angles in the structure of Sap1 show ``most favored'' or ``additionally allowed'' conformations, while residues His11 (chain A), Val12 (chain B), and Asn160 (chain A/B) exhibit ``generously allowed'' conformation. In Sap5, all main-chain angles show ``most favored'' or ``additionally allowed'' conformations.
Accession codes

The coordinates of the Sap1 apoenzyme and Sap5 complexed with pepstatin A have been deposited at the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the accession codes 2QZW and 2QZX, respectively.

ingly, Sap1 did not form crystals in the presence of an inhibitor. Rms deviations outlined in Table II confirm a high structural similarity between Sap1 and Sap5. When determining rms deviations, we omitted the flap formed by residues 81≠91, as this flap is observed to be rather flexible. In fact, all structurally known Sap isoenzymes including Sap2 and Sap3 show high structural similarity. Accordingly, the structural features of the overall fold of Sap1 and Sap5 are very similar to the structural features of the Sap isoenzymes Sap2 and Sap3. We recently described the structure of Sap3 in depth.28 The Sap isoenzymes consist mainly of b-strands formed into a tightly packed, kidney-shaped globular protein [Fig. 1(A)]. The bilobed structures clearly display an Nterminal and a C-terminal domain. Each domain contributes one catalytic aspartic acid (residues 32 and 218) to the active site. A funnel-like extended active site is formed by an N-terminal entrance loop (N-ent loop)

Sap isoenzymes mainly consist of b-strands arranging to a tightly packed, kidney-shaped globular protein. The side chains of the two catalytical aspartates are displayed in blue, the two disulphide bridges (Cys47≠Cys59 and Cys256≠Cys294) in orange. The loops tied together by the disulphide bridges are specified as N-terminal entrance loop (cysteine residues 47 and 59) (N-ent loop) and C-terminal entrance loops (cysteine residues 256 and 294) (C-ent loops). b-Sheet s7,8 (residues 81≠91) represents the active site flap which plays an important role in inhibitor binding. PepA is shown as a stick model colored in magenta. The figure was generated with Pymol.37 (B) Sequence alignment of Sap1-3 and Sap5 together with pepsin, a typical mammalian member of the aspartic proteinase family. b-Sheets, a-helices, and loops found in Sap1 and Sap5 are represented by arrows, cylinders, and lines. The catalytic aspartic acids are highlighted in orange. The amino acids highlighted in cyan show 100% identity within the sequences of all aspartic proteinases listed. Identical residues within the sequences of Sap1-3 and Sap5 are colored in magenta, while residues conserved in Sap1-3 only are displayed in green. Positively charged residues within the sequence of Sap5 that are not conserved are highlighted in blue. The numbering system is based on Sap2. The figure was created using ClustalW.38

and C-terminal entrance loops (C-ent loops). The C-ent loops of both Sap1 and Sap5 are highly flexible, as indicated by the high B-factors that were observed during

structure refinement. Residues 243≠250 of Sap1, which are part of the C-ent loop, could not be defined because of very weak density.

The optimal superposition highlights the highly conserved structural fold of the isoenzymes' middle and back part. (B) Close up view on the N-ent loop directed to the active site cleft. PepA binding is exemplified by the Sap5-pepA complex (white sticks). Yellow dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds of the statine residue of pepA to Asp32Sap5 and Asp218Sap5. In the structure of Sap5 the N-ent loop is lowered down onto the active site cleft which, compared to Sap1-3, significantly narrows its entrance. The constriction of the active site cleft entrance is consolidated by voluminous N-ent loop residues such as Lys50Sap5, Trp51Sap5, and Arg52Sap5. (C) Detailed view on substrate binding pockets S4 and S3. PepA bound to Sap5 is shown as white sticks. Yellow dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds between pepA and residues forming S4 and S3 pockets. The side chains of Arg297Sap5 and Arg299Sap5 directly point into the S4 pocket in Sap5, significantly reducing its size and making its polar character highly positive. Ile12Sap5 and Ile223Sap5 build hydrophobic contacts with pepA. The size of the S3 pocket in Sap5 is reduced by substitution of Asp120Sap2/3 or Pro120Sap1 by Arg120Sap5. Hydrophobic interaction between Sap5 and pepA can be observed with Ile12Sap5 only. Specifically in Sap5, the N-ent loop extends the active site cleft by contributing to the Sap5-S4 pocket (Trp51Sap5) and Sap5-S3 pocket (Lys50Sap5 and Trp51Sap5). The figure was made with Pymol.37

The rather flexible loop built by residues 81≠91 is a structural feature of aspartic proteinases known as the ``active site flap.'' Flexibility of the active site flap is of importance for substrate or inhibitor binding. After a substrate or inhibitor attaches to the enzyme, the active site flap moves toward the active site cleft. It thus adopts an ideal position for the formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between inhibitor/substrate and enzyme. This state is called the ``closed'' conformation of the enzyme and can be observed in the structure of Sap5 complexed with pepA [Fig. 1(A)]. Without a bound inhibitor the active site flap of Sap1 is more flexible, as indicated by different conformations found in Sap1 molecule A and B. Differences within the amino acid sequences of Sap1-3 and Sap5 do not affect the similarity of the overall struc-

tural fold of the isoenzymes. Sequence alignment performed using ClustalW38 [Fig. 1(B)] shows insertions of one residue in the amino acid sequences of both Sap5 and Sap2; though the overall secondary structure is retained. As described recently,28 the deletion of residue 52 in Sap3, a residue located in the N-ent loop, results in a less restricted entrance to the active site cleft of Sap3.

Figure 3
Electrostatic surface representations of Sap1-3 and Sap5. Negatively charged surface appears in red while positively charged surface is colored in blue. While the active site itself retains a high negative charge for all isoenzymes, the electrostatic charge outside the active site of Sap5 is strongly positive in contrast to the mainly negatively charged structures of Sap1-3. Interestingly, in all enzymes the charged residues basically accumulate on one side generating a rather hydrophobic and a rather hydrophilic side. The figure was created using GRASP.39

ever, significant structural and conformational differences subdivide the Sap isoenzyme structures into distinct subgroups. Analyzing the electrostatic surface of all four Sap isoenzymes led to a striking observation: the electrostatic surface representations in Figure 3 show that the structure of Sap5 is clearly different from that of Sap1-3. While the active site is strongly negative in all isoenzymes, the overall electrostatic charge of Sap5 is positive in contrast to the mainly negatively charged surfaces of Sap1-3. The isoenzymes display a rather hydrophilic front and a rather hydrophobic back (see Fig. 3). A second significant difference can be found at the entrance to the active site cleft. All, Sap1, Sap2, and Sap3 show a rather open entrance to the active site cleft, whereas Sap5 has a rather narrow entrance. This is caused by the N-ent loop which reaches down into the active site cleft and has voluminous residues such as Lys50Sap5, Trp51Sap5, and Arg52Sap5 [Fig. 2(B)]. Inhibitor binding is not likely to affect the overall conformation of the N-ent loop, which we learn from the similar conformations found in Sap1 with no inhibitor bound and those in Sap2 or Sap3 both complexed with an inhibitor. The conformation in Sap5 seems to be quite stable due to an interaction network between Arg120Sap5 and Trp51Sap5 (cation-p interaction) as well as Asp86Sap5 and Ser88Sap5 with

Lys50Sap5 (hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction of side chains, respectively).
Substrate binding sites of Sap1-3 and Sap5

Residues of Sap1-3 and Sap5, which form the substrate binding site pockets, display a sequence identity of 52%. The amino acid sequence of Sap5 differs most from the sequences of Sap1-3 [Fig. 1(B)]. Character, shape, and size of substrate binding site pockets, again, distinguish Sap5 from Sap1-3. Most significant differences between Sap1-3 and Sap5 can be found within the substrate binding pockets of the outer region (S4, S3, S20 ). The S4 pocket, which is found at the upper left edge of the protein--following standard orientation (i.e., nonprimed site pockets located left and primed site pockets right of the active center)--represents a relatively large pocket in Sap1-3. In Sap5, this pocket is drastically changed as follows: different from Sap 1-3 it has two arginine residues and not (like Sap 1-3) leucine, glycine, or asparagine (Table III). The side chains of Arg297Sap5 and Arg299Sap5 directly reach into the S4 pocket in Sap5, thus significantly reducing its size and turning its polar character into highly positive [Fig. 2(C)]. In addition, the long hydrophobic side

chains of those residues make hydrophobic contacts in Sap5 possible. The S3 pocket, in general, represents a notably large pocket compared to the common mammalian and fungal aspartic proteinases. Again, in Sap5 the size of the S3 pocket is reduced by substitution of Asp120Sap2/3 or Pro120Sap1 by Arg120Sap5 [Fig. 2(C)]. The more negative polar character of the S3 pocket in Sap1-3 becomes positive in Sap5. A distinctive feature of Sap5 is that the N-ent loop becomes part of the Sap5-S4 pocket

(Trp51Sap5) and Sap5-S3 pocket (Lys50Sap5 and Trp51Sap5). The size of the S20 pocket situated at the lower right edge of the protein is significantly maximized in Sap5 with substitution of Asn131Sap1/2 by Gly131Sap5. The polar character, though, is retained. The substrate binding pockets (S2, S1, S10 ) of the center region show few differences.

Sap1/2/3 by Thr195Sap5 and Lys193Sap5 should not go unnoticed.
The Sap5-pepstatin A complex--a common binding scheme

Sap5, which was strongly inhibited by pepA with an IC50 value of 6 nM (data not shown), was cocrystallized with pepA, the classical aspartic proteinase inhibitor. During the refinement of the structure model, density was clearly noticeable along the substrate binding groove of Sap5. Omit maps calculated during the refinement of Sap5 show an electron density of high quality for pepA into which all atoms of the inhibitor could be easily built [Fig. 4(A)].

PepA binds to Sap5 in a similar conformation as observed in our previously refined structure of Sap3.28 This is indicated by the superposition of both pepA molecules in Figure 4(B). Only the primed site end of the inhibitor corresponding to P30 exhibits a different conformation in Sap5. The ``new'' conformation in the Sap5-pepA complex presumably results from hydrophobic interaction between the side chain of Lys83Sap5 and the isoleucine side chain of pepA at P30 . Further residues contributing to pepA binding by hydrophobic contact in Sap5 are listed in Table II. The set of hydrogen bonds found in Sap5 includes the catalytic aspartic residues Asp32 and Asp218 together with residues Gly34, Gly85, Asp86, Gly220, and Thr222, which are highly conserved among the Sap iso-

enzymes [Fig. 1(B), Table III]. Residues 83 and 221 are also involved in the hydrogen bonding network by forming long distance hydrogen bonds. Although the residues of the Sap isoenzymes differ at position 83, the hydrogen bonds are formed by main-chain atoms and remain unaltered. DISCUSSION
Overall structure

The first Sap isoenzymes whose structures were determined are Sap226 and the closely related isoenzyme Sap2X27; both are typical aspartic proteinases. Sap2, Sap3,28 Sap1, and Sap5 all show similar features that identifies them as a unique family within the family of pepsin-like aspartic proteinases. The disulfide loop between Cys47 and Cys59, which constitutes the N-ent loop, is a highly important structural difference. This loop was denominated as second active site flap by Stewart and Abad-Zapatero.6 Compared to Sap1-3, the N-ent loop of Sap5 has voluminous side chains such as Lys50Sap5, Trp51Sap5, and Arg52Sap5, which reach down to the substrate binding cleft and are probably an additional barrier for substrates that want to enter Sap5's active site cleft. Sap5 clearly differs from Sap1-3 by its electrostatic charge--visible in the electrostatic surface representations. It can be the positively charged residues surrounding the active site of Sap5 that make the optimal pH for activity of Sap5 rise to pH 5.0 with a still noticeable activity at neutral pH. Sap2/Sap3 and Sap1, however, are most active at pH 3.5 and 4.5.29 The difference in electrostatic charges of Saps and thus their pH optima can be due to the adaptation of the isoenzymes to their specific host environment. This is in accordance to the finding that Saps are differently expressed in C. albicans during superficial7≠9 and systemic infections40,41 depending on the environmental conditions. The active site cleft itself remains negatively charged with all four isoenzymes presumably due to the highly conserved catalytic reaction. The accepted mechanism of pepsin-like enzyme function assumes that one of the catalytic aspartic acid residues has to be charged, whereas the other one has to be protonated.42≠46 Andreeva and Rumsh47 have pointed out the important role of amino acid residues that border the catalytic center in stabilizing this balanced protonated/deprotonated state. Accordingly, the catalytic mechanism demands a highly conserved site adjacent to the catalytic center.
Substrate binding pockets and substrate specificity

lian enzymes in that they also cleave substrates with polar residues such as histidine or lysine in the P1 position.49 Table II demonstrates a high conservation of substrate binding site residues of Sap4-6, which suggests very similar substrate specificities for all members of this isoenzyme subgroup. Unfortunately, only substrate specificities at the P1 and P10 sites for Sap isoenzymes Sap1-3 and Sap6 have been examined so far.17 P10 specificities are generally broader than those observed for P1. However, substrate specificities specific to either subgroup Sap1-3 or Sap4-6 in particular could not be defined. Because of the considerable changes regarding character and size of the S4 and S3 pockets in Sap5, different individual substrate specificities might also be expected for Sap1-3 and Sap4-6. Sap4-6--displaying two arginines in the S4 pocket and one arginine (Sap5) or histidine (Sap4/6) in the S3 pocket--are very likely to prefer hydrophobic and/or negatively charged residues.
Inhibitor binding Pepstatin A

The activity of Sap5 was strongly inhibited by pepA with an IC50 value of 6 nM (data not shown). Binding affinities for pepA to Sap1, Sap2, and Sap3 indicated by Ki values being 15, 17 (and IC50 27 nM,16), and 60 nM have been reported.17 The hydrogen bonding scheme found in Sap5 which strongly contributes to inhibitor binding is a highly conserved common theme not only for the Sap isoenzymes but also for other pepA-protein complexes.50≠53 Hydrophobic contacts slightly differ within the pepA-Sap complexes but a sufficient amount of contacts results in the similar binding affinities for pepA to Sap2, Sap3, and Sap5.
HIV protease inhibitors--ritonavir

Aspartic proteinases in general prefer substrates with hydrophobic residues at positions P1 and P10 for cleavage.48 However, fungal aspartic proteinases differ from mamma-

Various studies19≠22 have found that HIV protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir, inhibit Sap isoenzymes Sap1-3 in the low micromolar range. Ritonavir, in particular, was stated as the most potent inhibitor. For Sap4-6 a marginal inhibitory effect from HIV protease inhibitors has been detected (IC50 > 300 lM). HIV-1 protease, which is a member of the aspartic protease family, displays two catalytic aspartic residues that are provided by the subunits of the symmetrical dimer.54,55 To study potential interactions between the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir and the different Saps, we superimposed the structure of HIV-1 bound to ritonavir (PDB Code: 1HXW56) with the structures of Sap1-3 and Sap5. Ritonavir was modeled into the active site of Sap1-3 and Sap5 with its central phenylstatine residue (Phe¿ ¿ CH¿ ¿CHOH¿ directed toward active site residues ¿) Asp32 and Asp218 equal to the pepA-statine-Asp32PROTEINS

Asp218-complex. The most significant difference between Sap1-3 and Sap5 was found at position 193 of the isoenzymes. In Sap5, the long side chain of Lys193Sap5 represents a significant barrier for ritonavir's isopropylthiazolyl group when binding to the enzyme, whereas the smaller glutamic acid found in Sap1-3 at that position is of no hindrance. This could also explain the reduced inhibitory effect of ritonavir on Sap5. However, a conformational change of the respective side chain of ritonavir after binding to Sap5 is conceivable. CONCLUSIONS In determining two further structures of the 10 members of the Sap family, Sap 1 and Sap 5, we have been able to lay solid grounds for the structural comparison of the Sap isoenzymes. With the structure of Sap1, we have completed the set of structures of subgroup Sap1-3. This facilitates comprehensive structure-based drug design of inhibitors active on Sap1-3. With Sap5 we have described the first structure within the isoenzyme subgroup Sap4-6. Thus we have provided the structural basis for a detailed comparison of the two subgroups. Despite the highly conserved overall secondary structures of Sap1-3 and Sap5, Sap5 differs from Sap1-3 in its general electrostatic charge. In contrast to the mainly negatively charged surface of Sap1-3, Sap5 has a mainly positively charged surface. This indicates the adaptation of individual Sap isoenzymes to their specific environmental conditions. Both Sap1 and Sap5 seem to play a major part in superficial Candida infections. Determination of the isoenzymes' structures can contribute to the development of new Sap-specific inhibitors by a structure-based drug design program that is applied in superficial infections. Inhibitors for Sap5 have to deal with the considerably different character of the Sap5-S4 pocket and the Sap5S3 pocket. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank I. Mathes and F.
