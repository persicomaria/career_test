Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a small, homodimeric protein that binds to both RanGDP and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins, such as yeast Nsp1p and vertebrate p62. NTF2 is required for ef®cient nuclear protein import and has been shown to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP. We have used the crystal structures of rat NTF2 and its complex with RanGDP to design a mutant, W7A-NTF2, in which the af®nity for xFxFG-repeat nucleoporins is reduced while wild-type binding to Ê RanGDP is retained. The 2.5 A resolution crystal structure of W7A-NTF2 is virtually superimposable upon the wild-type protein structure, indicating that the mutation had not introduced a more general conformational change. Therefore, our data suggest that the exposed side-chain of residue 7 is crucial to the interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. Consistent with its reduced af®nity for xFxFG nucleoporins, ¯uorescently labelled W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the nuclear envelope of permeabilized cultured cells than wild-type NTF2 and, when microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, colloidal gold coated with W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the central channel of nuclear pore complexes than wild-type NTF2-coated gold. Signi®cantly, W7A-NTF2 only weakly stimulated the nuclear import of ¯uorescein-labelled RanGDP, providing direct evidence that an interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins is required to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP.

Introduction
The traf®cking of macromolecules, ions and small molecules between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), cylindrical proteinaceous structures, about Ê Ê 1200 A in diameter and 700 A thick, that perforate the nuclear envelope (reviewed by Pante & Aebi, 1996; Yang et al., 1998). Proteins and nucleic acids are transported actively along the central axis of the NPC (Feldherr et al., 1984; Dworetsky &

For example, proteins containing a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) are imported into the nucleus, whereas proteins containing a nuclear export sequence (NES) are exported to the cytoplasm. Although there are several different nuclear traf®cking pathways, they share a number of comÈ mon features (reviewed by Gorlich, 1998; Mattaj & Engelmeier, 1998; Izaurralde & Adam, 1998; Stewart & Rhodes, 1999). In each case, the substrate or cargo does not interact directly with the NPC, but instead is transported bound to a soluble carrier molecule, which then has to be recycled back to the original compartment. For example, proteins containing a nuclear import signal ®rst attach to soluble receptors of the importin-b family, either directly (Pollard et al., 1996) or via an È adapter such as importin-a (Gorlich et al., 1994). The importin-cargo complex then docks at the

Translocation is followed by displacement of substrate from the carrier molecule by RanGTP in the nucleus, after which the carrier, complexed with RanGTP, is recycled back through the NPCs to the cytoplasm where RanBP1 and RanGAP act to dissociate the complex and promote hydrolysis of the GTP È bound to Ran (Bischoff & Gorlich, 1997; Floer & Blobel, 1997; Lounsbury & Macara, 1997). Analogous pathways have been identi®ed for the export of RNA and protein from the nucleus (reviewed by Izaurralde & Adam, 1998; Mattaj & Engelmeir, 1998). Although the association and dissociation of the carrier-cargo complexes have been characterized, the precise molecular mechanism of translocation through NPCs has remained obscure. The nucleotide state of the Ras-family GTPase Ran is an important determinant of nuclear traf®cking (reviewed by Koepp & Silver, 1996; È Gorlich, 1998). GTP hydrolysis by Ran does not appear to be linked directly to transport (Kose et al., 1997; Nakielny & Dreyfuss, 1998; Ribbeck et al., 1999; Engelmeier et al., 1999; Schwoebel et al., 1998) and instead could be used, for example, to specify È directionality (see Gorlich, 1998) or to sort molecules prior to transport (see Stewart, 1992; Stewart & Rhodes, 1999). The nucleotide state of Ran is determined primarily by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). The principal Ran GEF, RCC1 (Bischoff & Ponstingl, 1991), which recharges the molecule with GTP, is nuclear (Ohtsubo et al., 1989), whereas the principal GAP, RanGAP1 (Bischoff et al., 1994), is cytoplasmic with a proportion attached to ®brils that emanate from the NPCs (Hopper et al., 1990; Melchior et al., 1993; Matunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997). This distribution of Ran GEF and GAP has lead to the proposal that cytoplasmic Ran is primarily in its GDPbound state, whereas nuclear Ran is in its GTPbound form (reviewed by Koepp & Silver, 1996; È Gorlich, 1998). Moreover, it has been proposed that this Ran nucleotide gradient speci®es directionality È of transport (Gorlich et al., 1996). Ef®cient nuclear protein import using the importin-b pathway also requires NTF2 (nuclear transport factor 2, also called p10), a 15 kDa dimeric protein that is essential in yeast and which binds to both RanGDP and to a series of NPC proteins (nucleoporins) that contain distinctive repeating sequence motifs (Moore & Blobel, 1994; Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Corbett & Silver, 1996; Clarkson et al., 1997). These sequence motifs are based on highly conserved cores, containing one or two phenylalanine residues, linked by hydrophilic spacers of very variable sequence but which are rich in charged and polar residues. The two most common cores are based on xFxFG (where x is usually a small polar residue or glycine) and GLFG (reviewed by Rout & Wente, 1994). In vertebrates, many xFxFG repeat nucleoporins bind wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Nuclei assembled from Xenopus

NTF2-Nucleoporin Interaction

egg extract depleted of WGA-binding proteins do not retain the ability to import NLS-containing substrates, but this ability is restored by adding back material eluted from WGA-sepharose (Finlay & Forbes, 1990), indicating that either the WGAbinding xFxFG nucleoporins, or proteins bound to them, are required for transport. Electron microscopy has indicated that xFxFG nucleoporins are located in the central channel of NPCs and also on both their nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces (Pante et al., 1994; Pante & Aebi, 1996; Grote et al., 1995; Fahrenkrog et al., 1998). Depletion of cytoplasm by the vertebrate xFxFG nucleoporin p62 bound to Sepharose, inhibits nuclear protein import in permeabilized cells (Paschal & Gerace, 1995), but transport can be restored to normal levels by adding exogenous NTF2. Although NTF2 has no detectable af®nity for RanGTP (Paschal et al., 1996), it binds RanGDP to form a de®ned complex (Moore & Blobel, 1994; Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Stewart et al., 1998a). The interaction between NTF2 and RanGDP is crucial for ef®cient nuclear protein import (Moore & Blobel, 1994; Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Paschal et al., 1996, 1997; Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996; Clarkson et al., 1996, 1997; Corbett & Silver, 1996; Wong et al., 1997). Recent work has indicated that a key role of NTF2 is to mediate nuclear import of RanGDP (Smith et al., 1998; Ribbeck et al., 1998), and so may function in a manner analogous to RabGDI (reviewed by Pfeffer et al., 1995) to direct RanGDP to the nucleus for nucleotide exchange. Ef®cient nuclear import of Ran is essential for transport because importin blike transport receptors exit the nucleus complexed with RanGTP and thereby continuously deplete Ran from the nucleus. However, the precise mechanism by which NTF2 facilitates Ran's nuclear import is unknown. NTF2 binds to RanGDP and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins in vitro at different, non-overlapping sites (Moore & Blobel, 1994; Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Paschal et al., 1996; Clarkson et al., 1996, 1997) and mutants of NTF2 or Ran that ablate the NTF2-Ran interaction disrupt the NTF2mediated import of RanGDP (Smith et al., 1998; Ribbeck et al., 1998). NTF2 exists in solution as a dimer and each chain has an unusual fold based on a bent b-sheet backed by a long a-helix that generates a pronounced hydrophobic pocket (Bullock et al., 1996). The crystal structure of the NTF2-RanGDP complex (Stewart et al., 1998a) indicates that the primary interaction interface is formed by the switch II loop (residues 67-78) of Ran with a smaller contribution from the switch I region (residues 40-43), together with the hydrophobic cavity and surrounding negatively charged residues of NTF2. Although the precise mechanism by which cargo-carrier complexes are translocated through the NPC has not yet been established, a considerable body of indirect evidence suggests that interactions involving xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins may be important. Addition of

581 Ran binding. Previous work has shown that RanGDP and xFxFG-repeat nucleoporins bind to separate non-overlapping sites on NTF2 (Clarkson et al., 1996). Moreover, because many different xFxFG-repeat nucleoporins bind to NTF2, it appears that the interaction involves primarily the xFxFG core of the repeats rather than the intervening hydrophilic linker regions that vary considerably in sequence (Clarkson et al., 1997). Inspection of the crystal structures of rat NTF2 (Bullock et al., 1996) and a series of mutants (Clarkson et al., 1997), together with the structure of the NTF2RanGDP complex (Stewart et al., 1998a) indicated that there was a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the NTF2 molecule, centred roughly on Trp7, which remained exposed in the NTF2-RanGDP complex and so was a candidate for binding to the hydrophobic aromatic side-chains of the xFxFGrepeat cores. To investigate this hypothesis, we mutated Trp7 to Ala and examined its in¯uence on the interactions with both RanGDP and xFxFG nucleoporins. Bacterially expressed W7A-NTF2 eluted from a S100 gel-®ltration column at the same volume as wild-type NTF2, corresponding to a Mr of 31 kDa, showing that, like the wild-type protein (Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Bullock et al., 1996), W7A-NTF2 was dimeric in solution. The ability of W7A-NTF2 to dimerize indicated that its conformation was probably similar to that of the wild-type protein. To con®rm that the mutation had not introduced any major conformational change into the molecule, we Ê solved its structure to 2.5 A resolution using X-ray crystallography. The mutant protein crystallized in space group P21 (Table 1) whereas the native protein crystallized in space group P212121. The crysÊ tals of W7A-NTF2 diffracted to 2.5 A using synchrotron radiation and produced a high quality data set (Table 1) that was used to generate a molecular replacement solution using the co-ordinates of wild-type NTF2 (Bullock et al., 1996). Re®nement using REFMAC (CCP4, 1994) produced a model having a ®nal R-factor of 20.8 % (Rfree 24.0 %) and good stereochemistry (Table 2). Figure 1(a) shows a portion of the 2Fo À Fc electron density map which was unambiguous in the region of residue Ê 7. The 2.5 A structure of W7A-NTF2 showed no signi®cant changes from wild-type apart from the

bacterially expressed fragments of several xFxFG nucleoporins inhibits nuclear protein import and/ or export (Bastos et al., 1996; Iovine et al., 1996; Stutz et al., 1996; Shah & Forbes, 1998) and several xFxFG nucleoporins, including Nup1p, Nup2p, Nup98 and Nup153, bind importin-b family members in vitro (Radu et al., 1995a,b; Rexach & Blobel, 1995; Moroianu et al., 1995; Shah & Forbes, 1998; Shah et al., 1998). However, it is not clear that the effects observed with added bacterially expressed nucleoporin repeat constructs are generated directly by an interaction between them and the carrier-cargo complex, as these constructs could either bind to and so obstruct other NPC components, or sequester other soluble transport factors. Therefore, although there have been indications that the nucleoporin repeats may be sites of interaction between carrier molecules and NPCs, direct evidence for their involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport has been lacking. Here we describe the W7A mutant of NTF2 in which the interaction with xFxFG nucleoporins is greatly reduced while its ability to bind RanGDP is retained. X-ray crystallography shows that this mutation introduced a negligible structural change, indicating that Trp7, which is exposed on the surface (Bullock et al., 1996), is close to the binding site of the xFxFG repeat cores. W7A-NTF2 binds more weakly to NPCs than wild-type NTF2, especially in the central channel, and mediates the nuclear import of RanGDP less ef®ciently, providing direct evidence for the involvement of the NTF2-nucleoporin interaction in this transport process. Consistent with this evidence, a soluble construct of yeast nucleoporin Nsp1p containing 19 xFxFG repeats is able to reduce substantially the binding of NTF2 to the nuclear envelope of permeabilized cells and inhibit the nuclear import of Ran.

mutated side-chain (Figure 1(b)) and at the C terminus after residue 122. The C terminus of NTF2 is thought to be ¯exible and differs in conformation between both chains in wild-type NTF2 (Bullock et al., 1996) and in NTF2-RanGDP complex crystals (Stewart et al., 1998a). Pairwise comparisons for Ca atom rms deviation for residues 5-120 between the two chains in the wild-type NTF2 asymmetric unit and the four chains in the W7A-NTF2 asymmetric Ê unit ranged between 0.37 and 0.48 A. Therefore, because the mutation did not introduce an extensive conformational change, the crystal structure indicates that the effects observed with W7A-NTF2 were due directly to the altered side-chain. The W7A mutation reduces binding of NTF2 to xFxFG repeat nucleoporins while retaining binding to RanGDP We used both ¯uorescence and Sepharose-bead binding assays (Clarkson et al., 1996, 1997; Wong et al., 1997) to test the effect of the W7A mutation on the molecular interactions of NTF2. Both wildtype and W7A-NTF2 protein coupled to Sepharose

beads bound RanGDP to comparable levels (Figure 2(a)), whereas constructs corresponding to 19 xFxFG repeats of yeast nucleoporin Nsp1p (Clarkson et al., 1996) or 11 xFxFG repeats of murine nucleoporin p62 (Buss & Stewart, 1995) bound strongly to wild-type NTF2-Sepharose beads but bound very weakly to W7A-NTF2 beads (Figure 2(a)). Similarly, whereas wild-type NTF2 bound to the Nsp1p xFxFG repeat-containing construct coupled to Sepharose, W7A-NTF2 bound much less strongly (Figure 2(b)). In summary, the solution binding assays gave a clear indication that although W7A-NTF2 bound RanGDP in a similar manner to the wild-type protein, the mutant's binding to the xFxFG repeats of Nsp1p and p62 was substantially reduced. We used ¯uorescence quenching and bead-binding assays to obtain a more quantitative picture of the effect of the W7A mutation on the interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeats (Figure 3). Because NTF2 is a dimer and the xFxFG repeatcontaining constructs contained a number of repeats, strictly one can only measure an avidity (analogous to that frequently employed in, for

583 mutant protein. Moreover, these assay conditions closely parallel the conditions likely to be found in NPCs where many of the nucleoporins that line the central channel contain multiple xFxFG repeats. For wild-type NTF2, bead-binding assays gave similar operational Kd values (of the order of 23 mM) for both p62 and Nsp1p constructs and comparable values were obtained for the Nsp1p-NTF2 interaction using ¯uorescence assays (the poor solubility and ¯uorescence properties of the p62 xFxFG constructs frustrated measuring its Kd accurately by ¯uorescence). Because we saw no evidence for co-operativity in this interaction, we assumed, as a ®rst approximation, that the xFxFGbinding site on each chain of the NTF2 dimer behaved independently. On this basis, the ¯uorescence data for the Nsp1p construct binding to NTF2 were consistent with a Kd of 1.9(Æ0.2) mM (Æ standard deviation) and the bead-binding data with a Kd of 3.2(Æ1.0) mM, whereas bead binding for the p62 xFxFG construct gave a Kd of 1.4(Æ0.3) mM. If indeed there was a level of cooperativity in the interaction, possibly arising from the multidentate nature of the nucleoporin ligand, the true Kd would be even weaker, and so the Kd

(a) Nsp1p (Clarkson et al., 1996) binds to W7A-NTF2 (lane 2) much less strongly than wild-type NTF2 (lane 3), whereas RanGDP binds equally to W7A-NTF2 (lane 4) and wild-type protein (lane 5). A mixture of RanGDP and Nsp1p bind simultaneously to wildtype NTF2 (lane 7), whereas from this mixture only RanGDP shows signi®cant af®nity for W7A-NTF2 beads (lane 6). As negative controls, neither the 19 Nsp1p xFxFG repeats (lane 8) nor RanGDP (lane 9) bind signi®cantly to ovalbumin-Sepharose beads. (b) Similarly, the xFxFG repeat-containing N terminus of p62 (Buss & Stewart, 1995) also binds W7A-NTF2 much more weakly than wild-type. (c) Whereas wild-type NTF2 (lane 1) binds to Nsp1p-Sepharose beads, W7A-NTF2 (lane 2) shows no detectable binding. Note that, although NTF2 molecules were covalently coupled to the Sepharose beads, because it is a dimer, one of the subunits dissociated into the protein sample buffer and is visible by SDS-PAGE. Ovalbumin and Nsp1p are monomeric and therefore when coupled to Sepharose beads are not visible by SDS-PAGE (Clarkson et al., 1996).

NTF2-Nucleoporin Interaction

values quoted should be taken as upper limits for the strength of this interaction. As shown in Figure 3, W7A-NTF2 bound to the Nsp1p or p62 xFxFG constructs much more weakly than wild-type in either assay system. The W7A binding was so weak that it could not be saturated, and may well have been non-speci®c. It was not possible to determine binding constants precisely (Figure 3), but modelling the W7A data as the ®rst part of a binding isotherm indicated that the minimum value for the Kd for Nsp1p binding was of the order of 80 mM (¯uorescence assays) or 45 mM (bead-binding assays). Because it was likely that the mutated tryptophan residue was making a major contribution to the ¯uorescence signal, the operational Kd obtained for W7A-NTF2 using this method may not have been estimated accurately, and so it was reassuring that the bead-binding assays also showed a substantially reduced binding of the mutant to xFxFG repeats compared with wild-type NTF2. Consistent with the observation that binding to Nsp1p was at least an order of magnitude weaker for W7A-NTF2, a minimum value for the Kd of p62 binding to W7A-NTF2 of 10 mM (bead-binding assay) was estimated, again an order of magnitude weaker than that measured for the wild-type protein. W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the nuclear envelopes of permeabilized cells Previous work using light and electron microscopy has shown that NTF2 stains nuclear envelopes in a punctate pattern consistent with its binding to NPCs (Corbett & Silver, 1996; Feldherr et al., 1998; Ribbeck et al., 1998). To evaluate the effect of the W7A mutation on nuclear envelope binding, we labelled wild-type and W7A-NTF2

yeast nucleoporin Nsp1p containing 19 xFxFG-repeats (Clarkson et al., 1996) by increase in intrinsic tryptophan ¯uorescence of (a) NTF2 and (b) Nsp1p-coupled Sepharose bead-binding assay. (a) The increase in tryptophan ¯uorescence of wild-type NTF2 is saturable and much greater than for W7A-NTF2. Modelling the W7A data as the ®rst part of a binding isotherm indicated that the minimum value for the Kd was at least two orders of magnitude weaker than the Kd determined for wild-type NTF2. (b) Similarly, wild-type NTF2 binding to Nsp1pbeads was saturable and produced a value for the Kd similar to that derived from the ¯uorescence assay. Again, W7A-NTF2 binding was not saturable, and modelling the data as before gave a minimum value for the Kd at least an order of magnitude weaker than the Kd determined for wild-type NTF2. (c) Whereas binding of the p62 construct containing FxFG-repeats to NTF2sepharose beads was saturable, producing a value of the Kd of the same order of magnitude as that for the interaction between NTF2 and the Nsp1p construct, binding of the p62 construct to W7A-NTF2 sepharose beads was not saturable and was approximately an order of magnitude weaker than wild-type.

585 NPCs and show accumulation in the central channel through which material is transported (Feldherr et al., 1984; Dworetsky & Feldherr, 1988) as well as at the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 3, with W7A-NTF2, although there was still binding to the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces, the proportion of protein-coated colloidal gold bound to the central channel of the NPCs was reduced substantially (38 %) compared with wild-type NTF2. Reduced binding to the central channel of the NPCs would also be consistent with the reduced strength of the NTF2-nucleoporin interaction in the W7A mutant (Figures 2 and 3), because the xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins to which NTF2 binds (but to which W7A-NTF2 does not) are known to be primarily located along the central channel with some also located at their nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces (Grote et al., 1995; Fahrenkrog et al., 1998; Pante & Aebi, 1996). W7A-NTF2 mediates RanGDP import less efficiently than wild-type Previous studies have shown that NTF2 mediates the nuclear import of RanGDP (Smith et al., 1998; Ribbeck et al., 1998) and that the NTF2RanGDP interaction is essential for ef®cient nuclear protein import (Clarkson et al., 1997). We therefore examined the effect of the W7A mutation, with its consequent reduction in the strength of the NTF2xFxFG repeat interaction, on RanGDP nuclear import. The import of ¯uorescein-labelled Ran (Ribbeck et al., 1998) was assayed in the absence of NTF2, in the presence of wild-type NTF2, and with W7A-NTF2 (Figure 6). In the absence of NTF2, the ¯uorescent RanGDP stained the nuclear envelope weakly, but was not imported into the nucleus, whereas in the presence of 1.5 mM wild-type NTF2, ¯uorescent RanGDP was imported ef®ciently. By contrast, 1.5 mM W7A-NTF2 mediated RanGDP import much less ef®ciently than 1.5 mM wild-type NTF2 and showed only marginally higher nuclear Ran accumulation than observed in the absence of exogenous NTF2. Moreover, increasing the concentration of W7A-NTF2 above 1.5 mM did not increase the ef®ciency of import further. Therefore, as well as binding xFxFG nucleoporin repeats less strongly, W7A-NTF2 also mediated the nuclear import of RanGDP less ef®ciently. Soluble Nsp1p xFxFG repeats inhibit both NTF2 binding to nuclear pores and nuclear import of RanGDP We also examined the effect of the construct of Nsp1p containing 19 xFxFG repeats on both the localization of ¯uorescein-labelled wild-type NTF2 and on RanGDP nuclear import. As shown in Figure 7, the binding of wild-type NTF2 to the nuclear envelopes of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of RanGDP and Nsp1p was much lower than that observed with RanGDP

with ¯uorescein (Ribbeck et al., 1998), which did not alter the binding to either RanGDP (Ribbeck et al., 1998) or xFxFG repeats (data not shown) in bead-binding assays. When added to digitoninpermeabilized HeLa cells, the nuclear envelope staining of ¯uorescein-labelled W7A-NTF2 was reduced dramatically compared to wild-type NTF2 (Figure 4). Moreover, previous work (Ribbeck et al., 1998) showed that the amount of ¯uorescent NTF2 bound to the nuclear envelope is enhanced by the addition of RanGDP and indeed both wild-type NTF2 and the W7A mutant showed such an enhancement, although here too the W7A-NTF2 staining was still much less intense than that of the wild-type (Figure 4). Thus, these ¯uorescence microscopy data indicate that W7A-NTF2 binds to nuclear envelopes less strongly than the wild-type protein. W7A-NTF2 shows reduced binding to the central channel of NPCs We also used electron microscopy to investigate the differences in nuclear envelope binding between wild-type and W7A-NTF2. Previous work (Feldherr et al., 1998) has shown that when colloidal gold particles coated with NTF2 are microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, the particles bind to

Fluorescein-labelled NTF2 or W7A-NTF2 (0.8 mM) was incubated with permeabilized cells in the presence of an energy-regenerating system and, where indicated, with 2.3 mM of RanGDP. NTF2 localization was analyzed after ten minutes by live confocal ¯uorescence microscopy. The addition of RanGDP enhanced accumulation of both wild-type NTF2 and W7A-NTF2 at the nuclear envelope; however, the effect on wild type NTF2 was signi®cantly stronger than on W7A-NTF2.

Gold coated with W7A-NTF2 still showed binding to the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic faces of the NPCs, but showed substantially reduced binding to the central NPC channel (see also Table 3) so that now few NPCs showed a continues track of gold particles crossing the nuclear membrane.

alone. Indeed, in the presence of the xFxFG repeat construct, the binding of ¯uoroscein-labelled NTF2 to the nuclear envelope was comparable to that seen with the W7A mutant alone, demonstrating that the Nsp1p construct had competed effectively with the NPCs for NTF2 binding. Moreover, the addition of this xFxFG construct also inhibited the nuclear import of Ran. As illustrated in Figure 8, in permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of reticulocyte lysate, addition of the Nsp1p construct to a concentration of 54 mM signi®cantly inhibited the import of ¯uorescein-labelled RanGDP, consistent with an interaction between xFxFG-containing nucleoporins and NTF2 being required for ef®cient nuclear import of Ran.

Discussion
Previous work has shown that NTF2 mediates the nuclear import of RanGDP (Smith et al., 1998; Ribbeck et al., 1998). Moreover, a direct interaction between these proteins is required, since Ran import is defective with mutants of NTF2 that do not bind RanGDP and with Ran mutants that do not bind NTF2. We have now used protein engineering, based on the crystal structure of wild-type

(Bullock et al., 1996) and mutant (Clarkson et al., 1997) NTF2 and the NTF2-RanGDP complex (Stewart et al., 1998a) to produce a NTF2 mutant, W7A-NTF2, in which in vitro binding to xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins is reduced by a factor of at least an order of magnitude, while retaining binding to RanGDP (Figures 2 and 3). Light microscopy using ¯uorescein-labelled proteins (Figure 4) indicated that W7A-NTF2 bound to nuclear envelopes more weakly than wild-type and electron microscopy indicated that gold particles coated with W7A-NTF2 bound much less strongly to the central transport channel of the nuclear pore complexes in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, in contrast to wild-type NTF2 (Smith et al., 1998; Ribbeck et al., 1998), W7A-NTF2 shows only weak stimulation of the nuclear import of ¯uorescently labelled RanGDP (Figure 6), providing direct evidence that the mechanism for NTF2-mediated Ran import involves an interaction of NTF2 with xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. Binding of NTF2 to NPCs The reduced binding of W7A-NTF2 to nuclear envelopes relative to wild-type (Figure 4) and the

Figure 6. The NTF2-RanGDP interaction is required for Ran import. Nuclear import of ¯uorescein-labelled RanGDP (1.5 mM) was performed in permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of an energy regenerating system and reticulocyte lysate that had been depleted of NTF2 (Ribbeck et al., 1998). Uptake of ¯uorescein-Ran into the nuclei was analyzed after ten minutes by confocal ¯uorescence microscopy of living cells using the ¯uorescein channel. Addition of 0.75 mM wild-type NTF2 (dimer) ef®ciently restored Ran import activity, whereas addition of the W7A-NTF2 mutant even at approximately fourfold higher concentrations (2.5 mM) only weakly stimulated Ran import.

inhibition of the binding of wild-type NTF2 to nuclear envelopes by added xFxFG repeats (Figure 7) both indicate that NTF2's binding to NPCs is mediated through its interaction with the xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins such as Nsp1p and p62. However, both ¯uorescein-labelled material and NTF2-coated gold particles still showed some residual binding to the nuclear envelope. In the case of permeabilized cells, this residual binding was increased by the addition of RanGDP (Figure 4). There appeared to be more residual binding with the coated gold particles, but it is not straightforward to compare each method quantitatively. The residual binding present with the coated gold particles may have been due to the endogenous levels of Ran present in intact Xenopus oocytes which, as shown in Figure 4, would be expected to increase the level of NTF2 binding to the nuclear envelope. However, the residual binding seen with coated gold particles could also have derived, at least partially, from non-speci®c attachment of the gold particles to the periphery of the NPCs. Signi®cantly the residual binding seen with gold particles coated with W7A-NTF2 was located mainly at the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces of the NPCs and was strikingly absent from the central transport channel of the pores where the majority of the xFxFG nucleoporins are thought to be located (Grote et al., 1995). The residual binding of both ¯uorescein-labelled W7A-NTF2 and W7A-NTF2-coated colloidal gold particles to NPCs could derive from several causes. For example, although both the bead-binding and

¯uorescence assays (Figures 2 and 3) indicated that the interaction of NTF2 with xFxFG repeats was weaker in the W7A mutant, this interaction may not have been entirely ablated by this mutation. A residual binding of W7A-NTF2 to xFxFG repeats could account for the residual levels bound to NPCs seen by both light (Figure 4) and electron (Figure 5) microscopy and also for the observation that, although its Ran import activity was reduced, it was not completely eliminated. In addition, the environment in which NTF2 binding is occurring at the NPC may be rather different from that employed for solution binding studies. Although the effective concentration of xFxFG repeats within the pore is unknown, it is likely to be relatively high, since several nucleoporins contain these repeats, often in up to 20 copies per chain. Electron microscopy indicates that these repeats tend to be concentrated along the central channel (Grote et al., 1995; Fahrenkrog et al., 1998). If, as a ®rst approximation, one assumes that there could be eight copies of ten different nucleoporins each containing 20 repeat cores located in the central channel Ê Ê occupying a cylinder 700 A long and 300 A in diameter, the effective xFxFG core concentration in the channel would be of the order of 50 mM. In addition, the labelled gold particles probably contained several NTF2 molecules and thus were also multidentate. Therefore, even quite weak interactions between W7A-NTF2 and the repeats could result in some binding occurring at the NPC, albeit considerably less than observed with wild-type NTF2. Alternatively, NTF2 could also be binding

NTF2-Nucleoporin Interaction

Figure 7. Soluble Nsp1p xFxFG repeats compete with the nuclear pore for binding to NTF2. Fluorescienlabelled wild-type or W7A-NTF2 (1.75 mM) was incubated in the presence of an energy-regenerating system and, where indicated, with 2.3 mM of RanGDP, NTF2 localization was analysed after ten minutes by confocal ¯uorescence microscopy. The addition of 17 mM Nsp1p construct containing 19 xFxFG repeats signi®cantly reduced the binding of wild-type NTF2 to the nuclear envelope.

Figure 8. Soluble Nsp1p inhibits nuclear import of RanGDP. Nuclear import of ¯uorescein-labelled RanGDP (1.5 mM) was performed in permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of an energy regenerating system and reticulocyte lysate. Uptake of ¯uoresceinRan into the nuclei was analyzed after ten minutes by confocal ¯uorescence microscopy of these cells using the ¯uorescein channel. Without the addition of the Nsp1p construct containing 19 xFxFG repeats, ¯uoresceinlabelled Ran accumulated in the nucleus and so gave a bright nuclear ¯uorescence signal, whereas addition of 54 mM Nsp1p signi®cantly inhibited nuclear import of Ran and resulted in a marked reduction of the nuclear ¯uorescence signal.

another, as yet unidenti®ed nucleoporin. Although clearly further work will be required to de®ne more precisely the basis of the residual binding of W7A-NTF2 to the nucleoplasmic face of NPCs, the loss of binding to the central channel is certainly consistent with the reduced binding to xFxFG nucleoporins observed in vitro (Figures 2 and 3). The weak binding constant observed for the interaction between wild-type NTF2 and the xFxFG repeats of Nsp1p was consistent with NTF2 forming a number of transient attachments to xFxFG nucleoporins during nuclear Ran import. The operational binding constant calculated assuming no co-operation between sites was of the order of 3 mM, but this probably overestimated the strength of the interaction because the locally high concentration of xFxFG cores could tend to facilitate rapid rebinding once NTF2 had dissociated. The on-rate of association between NTF2 and xFxFG repeats would be expected to be in the range 107-108 sÀ1 (Berg & von Hippel, 1985), and so a 3 mM binding constant would imply an off-rate of the order of 30-300 sÀ1. Consequently a binding constant of this magnitude would imply that interactions between NTF2 and xFxFG nucleoporins would be transient and so ideally suited to allowing a rapid attachment and detachment of

NTF2 to nucleoporins as it passed through a NPC. Thus, the Kd for the NTF2-xFxFG nucleoporin interaction is ideally suited for allowing the NTF2RanGDP complex to translocate through NPCs by hopping from one nucleoporin to the next along the central channel.

Implications for nuclear protein import The results obtained with W7A-NTF2 have demonstrated a direct involvement of the NTF2xFxFG nucleoporin interaction in the nuclear import of RanGDP. This ®rst direct demonstration of a functional interaction between a xFxFG nucleoporin and a transport factor raises the question of whether an analogous interaction is involved in other import pathways. Although other cargo molecules are imported using importin-b family member transport factors rather than NTF2 as carriers, there are a number of parallels between the import of Ran and that of other proteins. For example, interactions between members of the importin-b family and several xFxFG or GLFG repeat-containing nucleoporins have been identi®ed by both in vitro binding assays and the in vivo yeast two-hybrid system (Radu et al., 1995a,b; Rexach & Blobel, 1995; Bastos et al., 1996; Iovine et al., 1996; Shah et al., 1998). Moreover, bacterially expressed constructs corresponding to

589 series of weak interactions with repeat-containing nucleoporins. In summary, W7A-NTF2 retains its af®nity for RanGDP, but has reduced af®nity for xFxFG nucleoporins in vitro and binds less strongly to NPCs. Because the structure of W7A-NTF2 is very similar to that of the wild-type protein, a binding site for xFxFG nucleoporins on NTF2 is probably at or near Trp7. Indeed it is likely that the sidechain of residue 7 participates directly in the interaction with the hydrophobic residues in the cores of the xFxFG repeats and this would provide a rationale for why so many nucleoporin repeats are rich in hydrophobic residues such as phenylalanine. W7A-NTF2 stimulates the nuclear import of RanGDP less effectively than wild-type NTF2, and so provides direct evidence for the involvement of an interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG nuceloporins in this process.

xFxFG repeat domains of several nucleoporins have been shown to exert a dominant negative effect on nucleocytoplasmic transport (Radu et al., 1995b; Moroianu et al., 1997; Shah & Forbes, 1998). A clear picture of the role of these sequence repeats in the import of nuclear transport factors and substrates has not yet emerged, although there appears to be a correlation between interactions with GLFG nucleoporins and export (Iovine & Wente, 1997), whereas interactions with xFxFG nucleoporins appear to be associated with import (Shah & Forbes, 1998). At least for traf®cking involving importin-b, Rexach & Blobel (1995) have proposed that nuclear protein import could be mediated by cycles of attachment and detachment of cargo-carrying molecules to these repeats. The extent to which the interaction of carrier molecules of the importin-b family with nucleoporins resembles that between NTF2 and nucleoporins is not completely clear. However, importin-b (or the importin a/b heterodimer) appears to only interact with some xFxFG nucleoporins and not with others (see, for example, Percipalle et al., 1997; Shah et al., 1998), whereas NTF2 appears to interact more generally with xFxFG nucleoporins (Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Clarkson et al., 1996, 1997). Although blot overlays (Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996) indicated that NTF2 binds to both xFxFG and GLFG repeat-containing nucleoporins, yeast two-hybrid assays (Clarkson et al., 1997) showed only an interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins and did not detect an interaction between NTF2 and GLFG-repeat containing nucleoporins. Thus, whereas NTF2 is probably binding to the xFxFG cores of these repeats (Clarkson et al., 1997), it may be that the importin a/b heterodimer is binding instead to some of the linkers. Moreover, it could be that the interaction between nucleoporins and importin-b could be indirect and involve both importin-b and the nucleoporins binding an additional protein. Furthermore, although addition of bacterially expressed constructs containing the repeat regions of xFxFG nucleoporins can act as a dominant negative inhibitor of nuclear protein import (Radu et al., 1995a; Moroianu et al., 1997; Shah & Forbes, 1998), it is not clear that this effect is mediated directly through an interaction with importin-b. Indeed added xFxFG repeats could, for example, inhibit nuclear protein import by sequestering NTF2 and thereby inhibiting RanGDP's nuclear import and associated recharging with GTP by RCC1. Clearly further experimental work will be needed to resolve this point and, in this context, unfortunately it has not yet been possible to generate importin-b mutants analogous to W7A-NTF2 in which the binding to xFxFG nucleoporins was reduced while retaining their other interactions associated with traf®cking. However, the general similarity between the NTF2 and importin-b pathways certainly lends plausibility to the idea of the translocation through NPCs of an importin a/b substrate complex being mediated by a

Materials and Methods
Molecular biology The W7A mutant of murine NTF2 was made by using PCR-based site-speci®c mutagenesis as described (Clarkson et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 1998b). After cloning into the phage T7-based expression vector, pET15b, the inserted DNA was sequenced to ensure that Trp7 was mutated to Ala7 and that no other mutations were present in the construct. W7A-NTF2 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) at 34  C overnight without induction. Protein was puri®ed by DE52 ionexchange chromatography followed by gel-®ltration on an S100 column using the protocol described previously for wild-type NTF2 (Kent et al., 1996). The puri®ed protein was over 95 % pure by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie staining (Laemmli, 1970). Bead-binding assays Solution binding assays using either wild-type or W7A NTF2 were performed as described (Clarkson et al., 1997) with minor modi®cations. NTF2 was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads at a concentration of 3.6 mg/ml; and binding and washing were carried out in PBS  0.1 % (v/v) Tween-20 to reduce non-speci®c interactions. Ran, the repeat domain of Nsp1p containing 19 xFxFG repeats, and the repeat domain of p62 containing 11 xFxFG repeats were all obtained by expression in E. coli, and puri®ed as described (Buss & Stewart, 1995; Clarkson et al., 1996). The p62 protein was pre-treated by incubation with ovalbumin-coupled Sepharose beads to remove the sub-population of molecules which appeared to bind non-speci®cally to ovalbumin and could not be washed out. In order to determine Kd values, Nsp1p was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads at a concentration of approximately 3 mg/ml. Binding of wild-type or W7ANTF2 was carried out as before in PBS 0.1 % Tween-20, but the washing steps were omitted because they reduced the effective concentration of NTF2 in solution. The amount of NTF2 bound to beads was visualized by digitizing the SDS-PAGE protein gel using either the Kodak Digital Science system or a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitomer SI and quantitating using Image-

590
Quant (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of NTF2 occluded in the bead pellet was estimated using ovalbumin-coupled Sepharose beads. Occlusion of NTF2 in ovalbumin beads was linear with respect to free NTF2 concentration and subtracting this line from Nsp1p-bead data resulted in binding curves shown (Figure 3(b)). It was not possible to couple the p62 construct to CNBrSepharose beads and so Kd values for the interaction between p62 and NTF2 were determined using either wild-type or W7A-NTF2 coupled Sepharose beads and adding soluble p62 which had been pretreated with ovalbumin-Sepharose beads. Fluorescence assays Wild-type rat NTF2 contains three tryptophan residues, which give a ¯uorescence emission maximum at 340 nm when excited at 290 nm. We developed an assay based on the observation that this ¯uorescence was increased when NTF2 binds xFxFG repeat-containing proteins. The Nsp1p construct contained no tryptophan or tyrosine residues and showed less than 1/2000 the intrinsic ¯uorescence of wild-type NTF2 when excited at 290 nm. Therefore, we could be con®dent that the ¯uorescence change observed in our assay was due to the interaction between the xFxFG repeats and NTF2. Titrating the Nsp1p protein into a ®xed quantity of NTF2 lead to an increase in ¯uorescence which, since Nsp1p had negligible intrinsic ¯uorescence, was attributed to the increase in NTF2 tryptophan ¯uorescence due to binding of Nsp1p (probably as a result of shielding from the solvent). Measurements of the intrinsic tryptophan ¯uorescence of NTF2 at 340 nm after excitation at 290 nm were carried out using a Perkin Elmer LS50B ¯uorimeter and FL Winlab software. Using slit widths of 2.5 nm and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively, the intrinsic ¯uorescence of both W7A and wild-type NTF2 varied linearly with concentration demonstrating that there were no artefacts due to the inner ®lter effect. A stock solution of Nsp1p protein was added serially in 2 ml aliquots to 2.3 mM W7A and 0.6 mM wild-type NTF2 (as assayed by absorbance at 280 nm) in an initial volume of 400 ml of PBS containing 2 mM MgCl2. Appropriate concentrations of mutant and wild-type NTF2 were used to obtain suf®cient signal from the tryptophan ¯uorescence. Fluorescence measurements were integrated for two seconds, repeated three times, averaged and corrected for volume for each point. Binding isotherms were generated using a simple least-squares curve-®tting algorithm and Gra®t software. Fluorescein labelling NTF2 and W7A-NTF2 were labelled essentially as described (Ribbeck et al., 1998) in 50 mM Tris-buffer (pH 7.5) containing 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg acetate. An equimolar amount of ¯uorescein-5H O-maleimide (dissolved in dimethyl formamide) was added and the reaction was carried out on ice for four hours. Nonincorporated label was removed by gel ®ltration on a NAP 5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg acetate, 250 mM sucrose. Electron microscopy Xenopus laevis were purchased from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and maintained in ®ltered arti®cial

NTF2-Nucleoporin Interaction pond water. Stage VI oocytes, approximately 1.2 mm in diameter, were obtained from mature females and had well-delineated animal and vegetal hemispheres. ColÊ loidal gold particles 20-50 A in diameter were coated with wild-type NTF2 or the W7A mutant and microinjected into manually defolliculated stage VI oocytes as described (Feldherr et al., 1998) using a Narishige micromanipulator and 10-15 mm tip diameter micropipettes. After approximately 60 minutes the injected oocytes were ®xed with glutaraldehyde followed by OsO4, dehydrated and embedded as described (Dworetsky & Feldherr, 1988). Sections were examined in a JEOL 100CX electron microscope.

RanGDP nuclear import assay The nuclear import of ¯uorescein-labelled Ran in permeabilized Hela cells was carried out in suspension at 19  C essentially as described (Ribbeck et al., 1998). The import buffer contained 2 mg/ml nucleoplasmin core (to block non-speci®c binding), 20 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 7.5), 120 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM Mg acetate, 250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA. The energy-regenerating system consisted of 0.5 mM GTP, 0.5 mM ATP, 10 mM creatine phosphate and 50 mg/ml creatine kinase.

X-ray crystallography W7A-NTF2 crystals with P21 symmetry were obtained by vapour diffusion using 8 ml hanging drops containing approximately 1.5 mg/ml protein and half-strength mother liquor at 18  C against a mother liquor of 1.32 M ammonium sulphate, 3 % (v/v) isopropanol, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After 15 hours, the drops were microseeded using fragments of old W7A crystals. After three days the crystals were fully grown. A plate crystal of dimensions 0.2 mm Â 0.1 mm was transferred to cryoprotectant (mother liquor plus 20 % (v/v) glycerol) for less than one minute and was ¯ash-frozen at 100 K. A native data set was collected at beamline 5.2 at ELETÊ TRA using synchrotron radiation of wavelength 1.2 A and a Mar345 detector and was reduced using MOSFLM and SCALA (CCP4, 1994). Table 1 presents the data collection statistics. It was possible to index the data set as having either C2221 or P21 symmetry. We chose to process the pattern using P21 symmetry because we had obtained P21 crystals with similar lattice constants using another NTF2 mutant (unpublished data) and so thought it prudent not to risk introducing spurious higher symÊ metry. Molecular replacement using a 2.3 A resolution wild-type NTF2 structure (Bullock et al., 1996; PDB accession code 1OUN) and AMORE (CCP4, 1994) produced a ®nal R-factor of 20.8 % and Rfree of 24.0 %. We used O (Jones et al., 1991) for chain-tracing and model building and REFMAC (CCP4, 1994) for re®nement.
