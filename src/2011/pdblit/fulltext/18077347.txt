The glucosylation of pollutant and pesticide metabolites in plants controls their bioactivity and the formation of subsequent chemical residues. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains >100 glycosyltransferases (GTs) dedicated to small-molecule conjugation and, whereas 44 of these enzymes catalyze the O-glucosylation of chlorinated phenols, only one, UGT72B1, shows appreciable Nglucosylating activity toward chloroanilines. UGT72B1 is a bifunctional O-glucosyltransferase (OGT) and N-glucosyltransferase (NGT). To investigate this unique dual activity, the structure of the protein was solved, at resolutions up to 1.45 Å, in various forms including the Michaelis complex with intact donor analog and trichlorophenol acceptor. The catalytic mechanism and basis for O/N specificity was probed by mutagenesis and domain shuffling with an orthologous enzyme from Brassica napus (BnUGT), which possesses only OGT activity. Mutation of BnUGT at just two positions (D312N and F315Y) installed high levels of NGT activity. Molecular modeling revealed the connectivity of these residues to H19 on UGT72B1, with its mutagenesis exclusively defining NGT activity in the Arabidopsis enzyme. These results shed light on the conjugation of nonnatural substrates by plant GTs, highlighting the catalytic plasticity of this enzyme class and the ability to engineer unusual and desirable transfer to nitrogen-based acceptors.

active toward DCA were purified from suspension cultures (4). The importance of UGT72B1 in DCA metabolism in planta was subsequently demonstrated by using transposon-disrupted ugt72b1 knockouts (6). Plants lacking UGT72B1 metabolized DCA more slowly than wild types and, instead of accumulating N-glycosidic conjugates, incorporated the xenobiotic into insoluble macromolecules in phase 4 reactions (Fig. 1 A). Unexpectedly, the knockouts tolerated chloroanilines more effectively than wild types, suggesting the glucosylation of chloroanilines is a less effective mechanism of detoxification than insoluble residue formation. The widespread N-glucosylation of DCA in plants (8) indicates that the activity catalyzed by UGT72B1 is important in regulating the metabolism of anilines in crops (6, 9). Furthermore, the formation of C­N glycosidic bonds is of potential interest as a chemoenzymatic route to generate nonhydrolyzable glycosides. Here, we report on the structural and functional characterization of UGT72B1 and the protein engineering of its unusual bifunctional OGT and NGT activity. Results
UGT72B1 Has Unique NGT Activity. Arabidopsis contains 120 family-1 GT-like sequences, of which 107 encode apparently functional proteins (3, 9). To systematically test the Arabidopsis UGTs for their ability to conjugate xenobiotics, the available collection of Nterminal GST-UGT fusion proteins was expressed in Escherichia coli, with 99 accumulating as soluble polypeptides (Fig. 2A). In the primary screen, crude lysates from the UGT collection were assayed, with UDP-glc as donor and TCP as acceptor (Fig. 2, Table 1). TCP was chosen, because studies with Arabidopsis protein extracts have shown it to be an excellent glucose acceptor (6). In each case, the specific activities of the UGTs were determined after quantifying the fusion protein. Although the UGT-specific activities in the crude lysates were lower than those determined for the purified enzymes, the sensitivity of the radiochemical assay was able to readily distinguish between active and inactive enzymes in this large-scale screen. Of the 99 expressed UGTs, 44 fusion proteins showed OGT

lants are constantly exposed to synthetic compounds, such as pollutants and crop protection agents, and are able to transform these xenobiotics by using a four-phase detoxification system that has immediate parallels with drug metabolism in animals (Fig. 1A). Absorbed xenobiotics are first metabolically activated by ``phase 1'' enzymes, which then facilitates their subsequent bioconjugation with polar natural products (amino acids, sugars, peptides) in phase 2 metabolism. In crops and weeds, the most commonly observed phase 2 reaction is glycosylation (1), a reaction catalyzed by family GT1 glycosyltransferases (2), which are more normally engaged in secondary metabolism (3). A diverse range of xenobiotics are known to undergo conjugation as O-, S-, and N-acceptors, with UDP-glucose (UDP-glc) being the most commonly observed sugar donor (1). Once synthesized, conjugates accumulate transiently in the cytosol before being transported (phase 3) to either the vacuole or apoplast (Fig. 1 A). Despite their central importance in the metabolism of herbicides, pesticides, and organic pollutants, the identity of the enzymes catalyzing the glycosylation of xenobiotics has only recently been determined through studying their activity in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (4, 5). Arabidopsis plants rapidly metabolize persistent pollutants such as 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) and 3,4dichloroaniline (DCA) by O- and N-glucosylation, respectively (4­7) (Fig. 1B). Several UDP-glc-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) in Arabidopsis have been shown to have O-glucosyltransferase (OGT) activity toward TCP (5), whereas only one enzyme, UGT72B1, was identified when N-glucosyltransferases (NGTs)

Fig. 1. Metabolic fate of pesticides and pollutants in plants, showing the central importance of N- and O-glycosylation. (A) After either direct uptake, or after phase 1 metabolism, xenobiotics bearing amine (R-NH2) or hydroxyl (R-OH) groups undergo phase 2 conjugation with glucose (G), as catalyzed by UGTs. Conjugates may then be exported from the cell and hydrolyzed to release the aglycon or imported (phase 3) into the vacuole. As an alternative to phase 2 glycosylation, xenobiotic metabolites can also undergo phase 4 polymerization into cell wall components to form insoluble bound residues.

activity toward TCP (Fig. 2, Table 1). OGT activity toward this xenobiotic was well represented in the large D, E, and L groups, but absent in group A. On the basis of enzyme-specific activity, the E group enzymes were the most active, with UGT72B1 being 20 more efficient than any other UGT in conjugating TCP. To determine whether the GST N-fusion affected NGT activity, UGT72B1 was expressed as both a native protein and pGEX fusion and a turnover number (s 1) determined under standard assay conditions. With DCA as acceptor, the purified pGEX fusion was shown to have an activity of 0.63 s 1, which was very similar to that determined with the native protein (0.57 s 1). This suggested that the GST ligation was unlikely to seriously disrupt the glycosylating activities of the Arabidopsis UGTs. The enzyme collection was assayed for NGT activity by using DCA as an acceptor (Fig. 2, Table 1). The only UGTs showing appreciable NGT activity ( 1 pkat mg 1 UGT fusion) were localized to the group E enzymes, with UGT72B1 being 400-fold more active than any other enzyme (Fig. 2, Table 1). UGT72B1 was also unusual in showing equivalent activities when functioning as an

OGT or NGT. With the exception of the related protein UGT72E2, the other UGTs showed a bias for TCP over DCA conjugation. For completeness, the UGT collection was also screened for Sglucosyltransferase (SGT) activity with 4-chlorothiophenol as xenobiotic acceptor (Fig. 2B). Appreciable SGT activity ( 1 pkat mg 1) was determined in six UGTs derived from the D, H, and L groups (Table 1). Although the SGTs in groups D and H had comparable OGT activities, those in group L showed a preference for the thiol acceptor. Of these enzymes, only UGT74B1 was known to be an SGT because of its glucosylating activity toward thiohydroximate precursors of glucosinolates (10). The other five UGTs had been shown to have OGT activity toward natural products, with UGT74F1 and UGT84B1 conjugating anthranilic acid and indole acetic acid, respectively. These experiments demonstrated the uniqueness of UGT72B1 as the only family 1 GT in Arabidopsis with high NGT/OGT bifunctionality toward xenobiotics. Database searches identified fulllength EST orthologs of UGT72B1 in soybean, red pepper, Medicago truncatula, tomato, and potato, with partial sequences

closest available search model. UGT72B1 displays 33% identity with MtUGT71G1, 31% identity with the recently determined MtUGT85H2 (11), and 28% with VvUGT1, a flavonoid UGT from Vitis vinifera whose 3D structure is also known (12). Although UGT72B1 is the first reported UDP-glc-dependent NGT, as expected for a family GT-1 enzyme, the structure assumes the glycosyltransferase-B (GT-B) topology. The GT-B fold features two / / Rossmann domains, which in UGT72B1 correspond to residues 6­243 (N-terminal) and 244­446 (C-terminal). As observed for most GT-B enzymes, the C-terminal helical tail (here 446­476) forms the latter half of a kinked -helix that crosses back into the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2 A). Structural similarity matching using the SSM server (13) and coordinates for both N- and C-terminal domains together reveal that MtUGT71G1, VvUGT1, and MtUGT85H2 are indeed the closest structural matches with 402, 398, and 394 equivalent Calphas (C s) overlapping with rmsds of 1.7, 1.6, and 2.0 Å, respectively. Because of potential differences in the orientations of the N- and C- terminal domains, each domain of UGT72B1 was treated independently for molecular replacement and structural similarity searches. The N-terminal (acceptor binding) domain closely matched the equivalent domain of MtUGT71G1, with 29% sequence identity and 216 C s overlapping with an rmsd of 1.8 Å. The N-terminal domain of VvUGT1 is somewhat less similar (rmsd 2.3 Å for 207 C s, 23% identity) and that for MtUGT85H2 (rmsd 2.4 Å for 204 C s, 27% identity). After this, the macrolide glycosyltransferase, OleI, has an rmsd of 2.7 Å for 149 matching C s but surprisingly none of the next 10 matches is a UGT, all having SSM (13) Q scores of 0.14. The C-terminal domain, which in GT-B proteins binds the nucleotide donor, shows a higher degree of similarity with related enzymes, as would be expected. The closest match, surprisingly, is not to another plant GT but to the human UDP-glucuronyltransferase 2B7 (14) (rmsd 1.8Å for 155 matching C s but just 26% identity). The C-terminal domains of VvUGT1, MtUGT71G1, and MtUGT85H2 are all close matches (rmsd 1.3 Å for 168 matching C s reflecting 38% identity over this region for VvUGT1, rmsd 1.1 Å for 165 matching C s, reflecting 43% identity for MtUGT71G1 with rmsd 1.3 Å for 167 matching C s, reflecting 43% identity for MtUGT85H2). Other family GT1 enzymes follow with lower but still significant similarity, notably the macrolide UGTs OleI and OleD (15, 16) (rmsd 2­2.6 Å with only 150 C s matching) and the vancomycin UGT GtfD with rsmd 2.5 Å 157 C s, reflecting just 10% identity.

observed in many other species. Soybean is well known to Nglucosylate DCA (1, 7), so its UGT72B1 ortholog GmUGT EMBL sequence accession no. AM489710 was cloned and assayed with DCA (52.5 pkat mg 1 pure protein) and TCP (118.2 pkat mg 1). The ratio of N- and O-conjugating activities was very similar to those determined with UGT72B1, confirming that this bifunctional catalytic activity is present in related UGTs in other plants.
The 3D Structure of UGT72B1 and Its Complexes. To understand the

basis for this unusual dual N- and O-glucosylating activity, the 3D crystal structure of UGT72B1 was determined in three different ligand-complex forms at resolutions from 1.4 to 1.9 Å [supporting information (SI) Table 4]. The structure was solved in a complex with (i) the donor UDP-Glc (although glucose was shown to be hydrolyzed and absent), (ii) UDP and Tris buffer, and (iii) in Michaelis complex (for O-glycosyltransfer) with TCP and UDP-2deoxy-2-fluoro glucose (UDP-2FGlc). The structure of UGT72B1 was solved by using MtUGT71G1 from M. truncatula (10) as the
20240 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0706421104

UGT72B1 featured crystals grown in the presence of UDP-Glc. The complex, at 1.4-Å resolution, reveals clear density for UDP but with either solvent/ethylene glycol or highly disordered glucose in the donor sugar site. Subsequently, the structure was solved in the presence of UDP and irgasan, but in this case, Tris buffer lies in the position normally occupied by the donor sugar. Although Tris is a well known glycosidase inhibitor by virtue its partial mimicry of the transition state, its presence in the active site of UGTs has rarely been commented on. However, the observation that bis-Tris propane was also determined in the active site of VvUGT1 [PDB ID code 2C1X (13)] reiterates that Tris-based buffers should be avoided when determining UGT kinetics and for complex formation. The Michaelis complex with TCP and UDP-2FGlc, a nontransferable UDP-Glc mimic (16), was solved at 1.9-Å resolution. Electron density is clear for both ligands, which interact predominantly with the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively (Fig. 2B). Interactions of the sugar donor are similar to those observed with VvUGT1 (12) and other family UGT1 enzymes (17), especially those active on UDP-Glc donors. Notably, the glucose moiety interacts with the enzyme through its O2 (here an F), O3, and O4 hydroxyls via hydrogen bonds to Gln-389 and Glu-388. The O6

hydroxyl interacts via a 2.8-Å hydrogen bond to the nucleophilic hydroxyl of the acceptor, TCP. As with all family GT1s, the acceptor (here TCP) binds predominantly in the N-terminal domain. Here, the TCP is enclosed in an entirely buried and compact hydrophobic site, enclosed by Ile-86, Leu-118, Phe-119, Phe-148, Leu-183, and Leu-197. The only hydrophilic residue present is Glu-83, which caps the acceptor site on the solvent side and thus presents a potential gateway to ligand entry and departure. It is therefore evident that conformational change must accompany ligand binding and/or departure given the buried nature of the acceptor. None of the three chloro-substituents of TCP makes an interaction ( 3.3 Å) with the protein, nor are there obvious hydrogen-bonding groups near these locations. The Michaelis complex of UGT72B1 is of particular interest, given that it provides a rare structural opportunity to dissect the geometry of catalysis in the near-attack conformation. Catalysis by UGT72B1 involves transfer of glucose to the acceptor with inversion of anomeric configuration of the UDP-Glc donor, to generate the -D glycoside product (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the singledisplacement mechanism, the attacking oxygen of TCP lies 3.8 Å from the C1 of glucose, perfectly poised for in-line nucleophilic attack with an O(acceptor)-C1(glucose)-O(leaving group) angle of 160°. Under normal circumstances, a poorly reactive acceptor hydroxyl oxygen requires activation through proton abstraction to generate a more powerful nucleophile, with a phenolic hydroxyl most likely requiring less activation than a high pKa species. As with the majority of other GT-B fold inverting enzymes, a histidine residue, His-19, is positioned to act as a Brønsted base, with its NE2 imidazole nitrogen 2.3 Å from the attacking oxygen of the phenolic acceptor (Fig. 3 B and C). In the majority of inverting UGTs (10, 12, 18), the equivalent histidine forms an Oacceptor-His-Asp triad (Fig. 3C), analogous to the geometry of the Ser-His-Asp triad of serine hydrolases (see ref. 19), where the aspartate classically balances the charge on the histidine after proton abstraction. Consistent with important roles for His-19 and Asp-117, mutagenBrazier-Hicks et al.

esis studies with UGT72B1 showed that the respective alanine variants had no UGT activity (Tables 2 and 3). UGT72B1 is remarkable in that it conjugates aryl amine acceptors in addition to activated phenols. Intriguingly, UGT72B1 also displays noncanonical GT1 geometry around its active center ``base.'' The histidine side chain is rotated through 90° compared with related enzymes (Fig. 3C) and does not interact directly with Asp-117, which is instead swung away from the ``catalytic'' histidine. Instead of interacting with the adjacent aspartate, the NE1 of His-19 now interacts with Ser-14. The consequence of these changes is that, whereas Asp-117 may play an important structural role, electrostatic stabilization of an imidazolinium ion by this residue is unlikely, at least in the conformation observed in-crystal. Additional support that the conformation observed is relevant comes from the observation that this noncanonical geometry and the entire active center geometry are conserved in all three complexes (UDP, UDP/Tris, and UDP-2FGlc plus TCP). To try to dissect the structural/chemical basis for N- vs. O-glycosyltransfer, a closely related but obligate OGT was investigated.
Protein Engineering of NGT Activity. To investigate the NGT activity

of Arabidopsis UGT72B1, the orthologous enzyme was cloned from the closely related plant Brassica napus. This ortholog was identified as being of interest because, although several UGT72B1-like ESTs have been sequenced in B. napus, crude protein extracts from this plant have negligible NGT but appreciable OGT activity (20). This suggested that the respective B. napus enzyme must have a very different profile of NGT vs. OGT activities to UGT72B1. The resulting cDNA, BnUGT1 (PDB ID code AM489709) showed 85% sequence identity to UGT72B1 (SI Fig. 4A) and was expressed in E. coli. Whereas both purified recombinant Arabidopsis and Brassica UGTs were active toward 3,4-dichlorophenol (3,4-DCP), only UGT72B1 N-glucosylated (3, 4 DCA) (SI Fig. 4B). The two closely related UGTs were then used for domain swapping, to probe substrate specificity through analysis of a series of chimeras (SI Fig. 4B).

UGT72B1 (Fig. 3D) glucosylated anilines. The variant amino acids in this region of BnUGT were then systematically mutated to give the corresponding residues observed in UGT72B1, with each mutant screened for NGT activity toward a series of anilines (2,4-DCA, 3,4-DCA, and 2,4,5-trichloroaniline) and for OGT activity with the respective phenols (2,4-DCP, 3,4-DCP, and 2,4,5TCP) under standard assay conditions (Tables 2 and 3). Attention was focused on residues 314 to 320 in BnUGT, with the substitution of all residues outside this region having no effect on any UGT activity. As a first experiment, all five variant residues within 314­320 BnUGT were simultaneously mutated to the respective amino acids determined in UGT72B1. This 5 mutation conferred NGT activity, notably toward DCA (Tables 2 and 3). Each residue was then systematically substituted, with the D314N mutation allowing BnUGT to glucosylate all three anilines, notably 2,4,5TCA. Similarly, the F317Y mutation of BnUGT resulted in activity toward 3,4-DCA 2,4,5-TCA and 2,4-DCA. Detailed kinetic analysis subsequently showed that the double D314N-F317Y mutant glucosylated the anilines at a similar rate to UGT72B1 (Tables 2 and 3). Having identified residues in BnUGT1, which on modification conferred NGT activity, the reciprocal residues Asn-312 and Tyr315 in UGT72B1 (Fig. 3 B and D) were replaced singly and in tandem with the respective amino acids from the Brassica enzyme.

Although UGT72B1-N312D retained significant NGT activity, under standard assay conditions, these activities were reduced to those seen in BnUGT1 in UGT72B1-Y315F (Tables 2 and 3). Kinetic studies with DCA showed this to be due to a major reduction in turnover, with binding being unaffected (Tables 2 and 3). NGT activity in the UGT72B1-N312D-Y315F double mutant was negligible, with turnover reduced 273-fold compared with the parent enzyme. Inspection of the 3D structure (Fig. 3B) reveals that Tyr-315 interacts with the loop containing Ser-14/Pro15. Therefore Tyr-315 may play an essential role in maintaining His-19 and Asp-119 in their (non-GT1 canonical) position through a hydrogen bond from the phenolic OH to the main chain carbonyl of Pro-15 (Fig. 3 B and C). Asn-312 also lies in this niche but makes no direct interactions with the loop extending from Ser-14-His-19. Discussion Chemically, the distinction between O- and N-glycosyltransfer to a hydroxyl vs. a primary amine is defined by the absolute requirement for deprotonation of the acceptor nucleophile in the case of O-glycosyltransfer (with poor nucleophiles). This is necessary to avoid the enormous barrier to the formation of the positively charged oxonium-ion [R-(OH)-R2; pKa 4 (21)], although it should be noted that this transition state is more easily attained with activated phenols. In contrast, proton abstraction is possibly not

required for the transfer to anilines. In the absence of deprotonation, the transition state would be a charged secondary amine [R1-(NH2)-R2; pKa 5 (22)], which, in contrast to an oxonium-ion, is a stable and easily attained species (Fig. 1B). Although we cannot rule out conformational changes upon binding, we propose that a significant contribution to NGT specificity is the ability of His-19 to direct and orientate nucleophilic attack, while not necessarily abstracting a proton from the aniline acceptor. Indeed, His-19 hydrogen-bonds to a lone pair on the acceptor to prevent conjugation of the amine lone pair with the aromatic system. This would increase its electron density and nucleophilicity. This role may be further facilitated by the noncanonical geometry and apparent uncoupling of His-19 and Asp-117. To test our hypothesis, the single H19Q variant was constructed. We postulated that glutamine could still orientate and enhance nucleophilic attack but be chemically unable to abstract a proton. H19Q is indeed able to perform N-glycosyltransfer (only 2-fold down on wild type) but was severely compromised in OGT activity with kcat with 3,4-DCP reduced to 1/300 of wild type (Table 1). It is possible that the hydrogen-bond from O6 of the donor glucose to the amine may contribute similarly to reduce conjugation of the amine lone pair. In that context, the 300-fold greater loss in activity for aniline vs. phenolic determined with UDP-xylose as donor is also relevant (6). Such a mechanism in which the ``base'' residue is tailored to match the pKa of the acceptor is not without precedent. Studies with mutant glycosidases have shown that removal of the charged base engineers acceptance of nonnatural sulfur-containing acceptors in transglycosylation reactions (22). It may also be relevant that the two characterized cytokinin-N-glycosyltransferases in Arabidopsis (UGT76C2 and UGT76C1) are rare examples of UGTs that do not have, based on sequence alignments, a histidine at the ``base'' position. In both enzymes, the residue is replaced with a cysteine, supporting a mechanism in which base pKa is better matched to acceptor chemistry. Recent studies on plant UGTs have shown that point mutations can alter both the regioselectivity (23) and sugar donor preference (24). With respect to O-glucosyltransfer, recent studies with the UGT85H2 from M. truncatula (31% identity with UGT72B1) have revealed that atypical structural features within the active site of these enzymes can allow distinct phenolic acceptors to be tolerated as substrates (11). Our results further demonstrate that the activesite chemistry and structural biology of specific UGTs may also enable these enzymes to mediate sugar transfer to chemically distinct acceptor atoms for industrial application. As such, together with a recent report examining the enzyme mechanism of a C-glycosyltransferase (25), there is now considerable scope for rationally engineering UGTs to generate nonlabile glycosidic bonds. These results also give insight into the potential for plants to

evolve resistance toward organic pollutants. Indeed, our results show that simple mutations could lead to the loss of NGT activity and render plants more resistant to phytotoxic choroaniline pollutants. Materials and Methods
GT Activity Determination. The Arabidopsis UGT collection were expressed as recombinant GST-UGT fusion proteins (9). Crude lysates were assayed for UGT activity in 20 mM Hepes OH pH 7.6 containing 2 mM DTT using UDP-[14C-glucose], as described (4). UGT-specific activities were calculated from the GST activity of the pGEX fusion (1.6 s 1) after confirming the integrity of the respective polypeptides by Western blotting using an anti-GST-serum (immunodetectable fusion protein directly proportional to activity, R2 0.98). For enzyme kinetic studies, Km and kcat (acceptor) determinations were carried out under saturating UDP-glc concentrations (0.6 mM UDP-glc). Kinetic constants were determined using hyperbolic regression analysis. Generation of Chimeric UGT Enzymes and Their Mutagenesis. Recombinant UGT72B1, BnUGT, and the respective chimeric and mutant enzymes were affinitypurified from E. coli as N-terminal streptactin-tagged fusion proteins (IBA) after being generated using a custom pET-STRP3 vector (see SI Text and SI Table 5). The coding sequence of BnUGT (PDB ID code AM489709) was derived by RT-PCR amplification from the foliage of B. napus using primers (CGCGCGCATATGGAGGAATCAAAAGCGCCTC and CGCGCGCTCGAGCTAGTGCTTGCCATTTTGC), which corresponded to the N- and C- terminal sequences of the enzyme, as reconstructed from four ESTs (5 CN729499, CD833304; 3 CN735050 and CD811855). To generate the UGT72B1-BnUGT chimeras, constructs pETStrp3UGT72B1 (A) and pETStrp3BnUGT (B) were digested with NdeI and XhoI, respectively, along with SstI, DraI, or XbaI. The 290-, 776-, and 1,110-bp fragments were combined in tripartite ligations with the digested pET-STRP3 vector to produce the chimeras ABBB, AABB, and ABBB. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using pETStrp3UGT72B1 or pETStrp3BnGT as template with the primers detailed in SI Text. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution. For structural studies, ugt72b1 was recloned into pET-30a vector (Novagen), expressed in E. coli Tuner cells (Novagen) and the recombinant protein harvested by using standard metalion affinity protocols. Crystallization and data collection details for the UDP-Glc complex are given in SI Text. The structure was solved by molecular replacement by using the program PHASER (26) with the N- and C-terminals domains of the search model (M. truncatula triterpene glucosyltransferase MtUGT71G1, PDB ID code 1ACV, ref. 10) treated as separate ``ensembles.'' The structure was rebuilt manually by using COOT (27) and refined with REFMAC (28) from the CCP4 suite (29) of programs. Details of the crystallization, data collection, and refinement of other complexes are given in SI Text. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
