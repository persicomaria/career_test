The crystal structure of phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase (PRAI) from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtPRAI) was solved at 2.0 Å resolution. The overall structure of TtPRAI with a dimeric structure was quite similar to that of PRAI from Thermotoga maritima (TmPRAI). In order to elucidate the stabilization mechanism of TtPRAI, its physicochemical properties were examined using DSC, CD, and analytical centrifugation at various pHs in relation to the association-dissociation of the subunits. Based on the experimental results for TtPRAI and the structural information on TtPRAI and TmPRAI, we found that: (i) the denaturation of TtPRAI at acidic pH is correlated with the dissociation of its dimeric form; (ii) the hydrophobic interaction of TtPRAI in the monomer structure is slightly greater than that of TmPRAI, but dimer interface of the TmPRAI is remarkably greater; (iii) the contributions of hydrogen bonds and ion bonds to the stability are similar to each other; and (iv) destabilization due to the presence of cavities in TtPRAI is greater than that of TmPRAI in both the monomer and dimer structures. Key words: differential scanning calorimetry, phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase, protein interaction, protein stability, X-ray analysis.

Proteins from thermophiles are remarkably stable compared with homologous proteins from mesophiles. To date, three-dimensional structures of many proteins from various thermophiles have been determined and compared in order to elucidate the mechanism of the extremely high stability of these proteins. Although many stabilization factors responsible for high stability have been proposed based on structural features (1­3), the molecular origin for the high stability of thermophile proteins remains to be answered. To address these questions, it is important to characterize the physicochemical properties of thermophile proteins in solution, and the stability should be analyzed on the basis of the structural features in comparison with their counterparts from mesophilic organisms. The results might provide valuable insight into the creation of stably folded proteins by protein engineering. Phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase [EC 5.3.1.24] (PRAI) catalyzes the conversion of N-(5-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate to 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate in the tryptophan biosynthesis path-

way. Two crystal structures of PRAI have been reported: one from a mesophile Escherichia coli (4) and another from a hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima (5) that has a maximum growth temperature of 90°C (6). PRAI from E. coli (EcPRAI) occurs as the C-terminal domain of a bifunctional enzyme, which is a monomer, whereas that from T. maritima (TmPRAI) is a homodimer. Although the structure of TmPRAI has a complete TIM barrel fold (5), the helix 5 in EcPRAI is replaced by a loop. The subunits of TmPRAI associate via the N-terminal faces of their central -barrels through multiple hydrophobic interactions. The side chains of the N-terminal Met and the C-terminal Leu of both subunits are immobilized in a hydrophobic cluster at the subunit boundary. Especially, the sequential hydrophobic residues (Leu50-Pro51Pro52-Phe53-Val54) in TmPRAI dimer protrude reciprocally into the interior of the -barrel of the neighboring subunit. Its hydrophobic amino acid sequence has been reported to be mainly responsible for the higher thermostability of TmPRAI (5), because equivalent hydrophobic residues had not been observed in PRAIs from mesophiles at that time (7). The oligomerization of several subunits is one of the important factors responsible for the extremely high stability of proteins from hyperthermophiles (1, 8­13). 569

570 Due to the recent abundance of Genome Projects, a large number of PRAI sequences have become available from many different sources. The alignment of all PRAI sequences from the Swiss Prot data bank (June 2004 release) shows that PRAIs from mesophiles, such as Geobacter metallireducens, Nitrosomonas europaea ATPC, Pseudomonas fluorescens PfO-1, Neisseria meningitidis Z2491 and, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, for which the optimal growth temperatures are lower than 37°C, have the same sequences from Leu50 to Val53 (LPPFV) as those of TmPRAI. This fact indicates the possibility that these mesophile proteins are present as homodimers and that the hydrophobic sequence of LPPFV is not specific characteristic of thermophile proteins such as TmPRAI. Recently, we determined the crystal structure at 2.0 Å resolution of PRAI from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtPRAI), which is an extremely thermophilic bacterium with a maximum growth temperature of 85°C. The overall structure of TtPRAI is quite similar to that of TmPRAI with a dimeric structure. TtPRAI also has a hydrophobic protrusion at the subunit interface, which is similar to that of TmPRAI. Therefore, in order to elucidate the role of the protrusion, the stability of TtPRAI has also been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the acidic range in relation to the association­dissociation of the subunits. In this paper, the thermostabilization mechanism of PRAIs from thermophiles will be discussed on the basis of the crystal structures of proteins from mesophilic, extreme thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic organisms.

Purification of TtPRAI--TtPRAI was over expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) containing only the trpF gene from T. thermophilus HB8. The E. coli strain was routinely grown at 37°C in 2.3 liters of LB medium containing 50 mg liter­1 ampicillin for 20 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,500 rpm for 5 min, suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and disrupted by sonication. The supernatant was heated at 70°C for 10 min. After heat treatment, the cell debris and denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 30 min) at 4°C, and the supernatant solution was used as the crude extract for purification. The crude extract was desalted through a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham-Biosciences) and applied onto a SuperQ TOYOPEARL 650M column (Tosoh) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0­0.3 M NaCl. The fraction containing the protein was desalted with HiPrep 26/10 with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 and subjected to a RESOURCE Q column (Amersham-Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0­0.3 M NaCl. The fraction containing the protein was desalted with HiPrep 26/10 containing 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and applied onto a Bio-Scale CHT-20-I column (BIO-RAD) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 10­100 mM phosphate, pH 7.0. The fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, 5k cut), and

loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (Amersham-Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 M NaCl. The purified protein showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration of the protein was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm, assuming E1cm1% = 10.57 as calculated from the molar absorption coefficient. Crystallization--The protein crystal used for data collection had a size of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3 and was obtained using the oil microbatch method by TERA (14). A 0.5 µl aliquot of protein solution (29.63 mg ml­1 in 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (27.5% isopropanol buffered with 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.1) and covered with 15 µl of paraffin oil. Block-shaped single crystals appeared after two days of incubation at 22°C. Data Collection and Structure Determination--X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline BL26B1, SPring-8, Harima, Japan. The crystal with Paratone-N and 10% w/v glycerol as the cryoprotectant was flashcooled in a 100 K dry nitrogen stream. The data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (15). The crystals belonged to the space group P4132, with a dimer in the asymmetric unit, a solvent content of

The refined model consists of 3,058 protein atoms and 301 water molecules in an asymmetric unit. The electron density of the C-terminal tail of each monomer, comprising residues 201­203, was not visible. The X-ray crystallographic data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1V5X). Differential Scanning Calorimetry--DSC was carried out with a differential scanning calorimeter, MicroCal VP-DSC (Northanmpton, USA). Prior to the measurements, the protein solution was dialyzed against the buffer used. The dialyzed sample was filtered through a 0.22-µm pore size membrane and then degassed in a vacuum. The buffers used in the presence of 0.1 mM EDTA were 50 mM glycine in the acidic region and 50 mM potassium phosphate in the neutral region. The protein concentrations under measurement were 0.8­1.5 mg ml­1. The DSC curves were analyzed using the Origin software from MicroCal. Analytical Ultracentrifugation--Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out using a Beckmann Optima mode XL-A at 20°C with an An-60 Ti rotor at a speed of 12 K or 18 K rpm. Prior to the measurements, the protein solutions were dialyzed overnight against the respective buffer at 4°C. Experiments at three different protein concentrations between 1.8 and 0.5 mg ml­1 were performed in Beckman 4-sector cells. The buffers used in the presence of 0.1 mM EDTA were 50 mM glycine in the acidic region and 50 mM potassium phosphate in the neutral region. The partial specific volume of 0.757 cm3 g­1

used for TtPRAI was based on the amino acid composition of the protein (19). Analysis of the sedimentation equilibrium was performed using the program "XLAVEL" (Beckman, version 2.0). CD Measurements--CD spectra were measured at 25°C with a Jasco-J720 spectropolarimeter. Far- and near-UV CD spectra were scanned 16 and 32 times, respectively, at a scan rate of 20 nm min­1, using a time constant of 0.25 s. The light path length of the cell used was 1.0 mm in the far-UV region and 10 mm in the nearUV region. The buffers used in the presence of 0.1 mM EDTA were 50 mM glycine in the acidic region and 50 mM potassium phosphate in the neutral region. The protein concentrations were 0.1­1.35 mg ml­1. For the calculation of mean residue ellipticity, [], the mean residue weight was assumed to be 108.1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Quality of the Model and Overall Structure of TtPRAI-- The refinement of TtPRAI structure converged to an R factor of 26.2% and a free R value of 29.6% for reflections in the resolution range of 35.0­2.0Å. The current model is a dimer with 200 residues in each subunit. The refined structure model of TtPRAI converged well with root mean square deviations (rmsd) from the ideal bond

length and angle of 0.007 Å and 1.30°, respectively. 89.2% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues were in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot, 10.2% in the additionally allowed region, 0.6% in the generously allowed region, and no residues in the disallowed region (Table 1). The monomer structure of TtPRAI adopts an 8-fold / barrel fold, as first observed for a triose-phosphate isomerase (20). As shown in Fig. 1a, two subunits of TtPRAI associate via the N-terminal faces of their central barrels related by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis. Two symmetry-related long loops (including Pro51 and Phe52) protrude reciprocally into cavities of the other subunit, which is similar to what is observed for TmPRAI (5). All the residues of TtPRAI dimer are visible in the electron density except for the three C-terminal residues (201­203). The structures of the two subunits of TtPRAI are substantially the same, as indicated by the low rmsd after structural superposition of 0.36 Å between their corresponding C atoms. However, the average B-factors of the main chain atoms of the subunits differ from each other: 54.93 and 30.58 Å2 for the A and B chains, respectively. The different B-factors of the two subunits might be a consequence of their different packing in the crystal. The high R- and free R-factors, despite

573 showing the highest deviations, as shown in Fig. 3, belongs to the flexible loop (residues Gly125­Pro135) that connects strand 6 and helix 6 (loop 66). The following might cause this large deviation. (i) Three residues between residues Pro130 and Gly134 of TmPRAI are absent from the loop 66 of TtPRAI. (ii) All residues in the loop of TtPRAI are visible in the electron density, while those of the TmPRAI have been reported to be invisible (5). The second large deviation that includes residues Glu106­Gln119 consists of loop 55 and helix 5. The deviations between the C atoms for each class of secondary structure of TtPRAI and TmPRAI were calculated to be 0.46 (42 atoms), 1.35 (73), and 1.37 (82) Å for  strand,  helix, and others, respectively. The structures of TtPRAI and EcPRAI were also superimposed with an rmsd of 1.40 Å between 181 equivalent C atoms in both proteins, and the deviations for each class of secondary structure were 0.62 (42 atoms), 1.60 (66), and 1.32 (78), respectively. These results indicate that the deviations in -strands among the three proteins are the lowest. Arrows in Fig. 3 indicate the positions of the  strands, where deviations are clearly lower than those in other positions. These results suggest that the  sheet structures in the ()8 barrel structure of PRAI are more conserved than other secondary structural elements. The conservation in the  sheet structure seems to be rational, because the  barrel, comprising the central architecture in the ()8 barrel fold, and -strands are directly hydrogen bonded to each other in the center of the molecules, whereas the -helices are connected to the -strands by loop regions. Dimer Interface--It has been suggested that the two loops 23 of the TmPRAI dimer provide an unusual mode of interlocking interaction that is responsible for the high stability of the protein (5). The three hydrophobic residues (Pro51-Phe52-Val53) in loops 23 of TtPRAI dimer protrude reciprocally into the interior of the -barrel of the neighboring subunit. The corresponding residues of TmPRAI are Pro52, Phe53, and Val54, which are completely inaccessible to solvent. Pro52 and Phe53 of one subunit of TtPRAI fit into the bottom (0) layer of the barrel (4) and the first regular layer, respectively, of the other subunit. The protrusion of these two residues might be important for the stability of the dimer. The N-terminal (Met1) and C-terminal (Leu205) residues of both subunits of TmPRAI form a hydrophobic cluster at the dimer interface. In the case of TtPRAI, however, the residue corresponding to the N-terminal Met residue of TmPRAI is missing, and the three C-terminal residues (201­203) are flexible and not visible in the electron density. Instead, Arg200 of TtPRAI can be superimposed on the C-terminal residue (Leu205) of TmPRAI. The contribution of terminal residues to the stabilization of the dimer seems to be weaker in TtPRAI than in TmPRAI.

the good quality diffraction data, might be caused by the high B-factors of the A chain. Amino Acid Compositions--TtPRAI and TmPRAI consist of 203 and 205 residues, respectively. The number of amino acid residues in PRAI from E. coli (EcPRAI), which is a domain corresponding to the phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase in a bifunctional enzyme, is 198. Table 2 shows the amino acid compositions of the three proteins. The proportion of hydrophobic residues in TtPRAI (132; 65.0%) is greater than that in TmPRAI (109; 53.2%); especially, the levels of Ala and Leu are remarkably different. On the other hand, the number of neutral residues in TtPRAI is less than half those in the other two proteins. The number of ionizable residues in the thermophilic proteins (TtPRAI and TmPRAI) is greater than in the mesophilic protein (EcPRAI), suggesting a contribution of ion-bonds to the thermo-stabilization of thermophilic proteins. Structural Comparison--Figure 2 shows the secondary structure-based sequence alignment of the three proteins using the secondary structural elements assigned with DSSP (21). The residue identity between TtPRAI and TmPRAI is 40.4% (82/203), and that between TtPRAI and EcPRAI is 25.1% (51/203). The alignment indicates that the mesophilic protein, EcPRAI, has a deletion of two residues at positions 51 and 141 of TtPRAI, and the insertion of one residue at position 109 of TtPRAI. These changes are conserved in both thermophilic proteins. Figure 1b shows the backbone structures of TtPRAI and superimposed TmPRAI using 197 equivalent C atoms. All of the  strands and some of the  helices seem to be structurally identical. The rmsd between the 197 C atoms of TtPRAI and TmPRAI is 1.17 Å. The region

The accessible surface area (ASA) of the dimer interface was calculated (Table 4). The total surface area buried at the dimer interface of TtPRAI was only 81.9% that of TmPRAI, suggesting a difference in the hydrophobic interactions between the two thermophilc PRAIs described later. Active Site--The active site of EcPRAI is speculated to be covered by four long loops, 22, 56, 66, and 88 (including helix 8) on the C-terminal side of the central -barrel (2). Electron density indicative of a phosphate ion has been observed at the potential binding sites of the phosphate-ester moiety of the substrate phosphoribosyl anthranilate in EcPRAI. Although the electron density of a phosphate ion was not detected at the equivalent position in TtPRAI, the superimposition of the two structures near the phosphate ion binding site for TtPRAI and TmPRAI reveals no significant differences, suggesting a conservation of structure near the active sites. Electron density for a phosphate ion might be observed at the corresponding site in TtPRAI if the crystallization cocktail contained phosphate ions. Ion Pairs (Salt Bridges) and Hydrogen Bonds--It is believed that ion pairs (salt bridges) play an important role in the stability of proteins from hyperthermophiles, because they occur so frequently. The number of ion pairs within 4 Å in TtPRAI is comparable to that in TmPRAI, which is greater than that in the mesophilic protein, EcPRAI (Table 3). The number of inter-subunit ion pairs of TtPRAI and TmPRAI is the same, but their positions differ. Arg148 in TtPRAI pairs with Glu18 (1) of the another subunit, and the corresponding Arg152 in TmPRAI bonds with Glu49 in a different secondary structural segment (2). This change results in the area of subunit interface in TtPRAI being less than that in

TmPRAI, which also weakens the hydrophobic interaction of the dimer interface of TtPRAI as described below. Table 3 lists the number of hydrogen bonds in the three proteins. The total numbers of hydrogen bonds shorter than 3.3 Å in the three proteins are almost the same, except for those of the dimer interface in thermophilic proteins. Hydrophobic Interaction--The hydrophobic effects on the conformational stability of proteins have been extensively analyzed by studies involving site-directed mutagenesis, and it has been revealed that hydrophobic residues in the interior of a protein contribute to conformational stability (22­24). Takano et al. (25) have found a general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability, using a series of hydrophobic mutants of human lysozyme. The change in unfolding Gibbs energy (G) due to the hydrophobic effect between the wild-type and mutant proteins (GHP) can be expressed as follows: GHP = ASAnon-polar + ASApolar (1)

where ASAnon-polar and ASApolar represent the difference in ASA of the non-polar and polar atoms of all residues, respectively, between the wild-type and mutant proteins upon denaturation. Parameters  and  have been determined to be 0.154 and ­0.026 kJ mol­1 Å­2, respectively, using the stability/structure database of mutant human lysozymes (26). For calculation of the ASA value, carbon and sulfur atoms in the residues are assigned as ASAnon-polar, and nitrogen and oxygen atoms as ASApolar.

Fig. 4. pH dependence of the apparent molecular weight (MWapp) of TtPRAI. Each data point shows the average value of three different concentrations (0.3 mg ml­1 to 1.0 mg ml­1) at 20°C. Potassium phosphate, acetate, and glycine buffers (50 mM) were used at pH 7.0, pH 4.4, and below pH 3.5, respectively.

the dimer interface of the two thermophilic proteins were estimated using Eq. 1. The ASA values of the native state were calculated by the procedure of Connolly (27) using the X-ray structures of the three proteins. The ASA values for the denatured forms were estimated using extended structures of each protein generated from the native structures using the program Insight II. The contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the stability of the three proteins is shown in Table 4. In the monomer structure, the hydrophobic interaction (GHP) of TtPRAI is higher by 15 and 56 kJ mol­1 than those of TmPRAI and EcPRAI, respectively. But the GHP value originating from the hydrophobic interaction at the dimer interface of TmPRAI is remarkably higher (44 kJ mol­1) than that of TtPRAI. This means that TmPRAI is more stabilized by hydrophobic interactions than TtPRAI in total, although the proportion of hydrophobic residues in TmPRAI was lower than that in TtPRAI (Table 2). Cavity Volume--Changes in the cavity volume in the interior of a protein affect its conformational stability (28). Therefore, the cavity volumes of the three proteins were estimated using a probe sphere of 1.4 Å radius (corresponding a water molecule) (27). The cavity volumes of TtPRAI in the monomer and dimer states are greater than those of TmPRAI (Table 4). The energy contribution to protein stability (GCAV) due to changes in the cavity size can be expressed in terms of the cavity volume (52 J mol­1 Å­3) (26). Using this parameter, the increment of stabilization (GCAV) of TmPRAI in the monomer and dimer states due to the change in cavity volume was calculated to be 3.4 and 12.2 kJ mol­1, respectively (Table 4), compared with those of TtPRAI. The difference in the contribution of the change in cavity volume to stability at the interface between TtPRAI and TmPRAI was estimated to be 5.4 (= 12.2 ­ 3.4 × 2) kJ mol­1, after subtracting the contribution of the monomer structure from that of a dimer structure. Molecular Assembly Forms of TtPRAI at Different pHs-- It has been reported that TmPRAI is a homodimer in solution even at pH 3.2 (9), although EcPRAI which is part of a bifunctional chain, is monomeric. Therefore, ultracentrifugation experiments of TtPRAI were performed at neutral and acidic pHs at 20°C to examine the molecular assembly forms at different pHs. As shown in

Fig. 6. Typical DSC curves of TtPRAI in the acidic region. (a), (b), and (c) represent excess heat capacity curves at pH 3.64, 3.88, and 4.06, respectively. The DSC measurements were performed at scan rate of 1°C min­1.

Fig. 4, TtPRAI is a dimer at pH 7.0 (MW of a monomer = 21.95k) but dissociates to monomers below pH 3.4. This suggests that the dimeric association of TtPRAI is weaker than that of TmPRAI at pH 3.2. Differential Scanning Calorimetry of TtPRAI--To verify whether the association-dissociation between the subunits in TtPRAI is related to the change in stability, the heat stabilities of TtPRAI were measured by DSC at the scan rate of 1°C min­1 in the pH region where the dissociation occurs (Fig. 4). The apparent denaturation temperatures above neutral pH were around 100°C (Fig. 5). DSC measurements could not be carried out between pH 6.5 and pH 4.5, near the isoelectric point of the protein, because the protein became turbid upon heating. Below pH 4.5, the denaturation temperatures decreased markedly with decreasing pH (Fig. 5). Above pH 3.6 the excess heat capacity changes in the DSC curves could be clearly observed as shown in Fig. 6. However, no excess heat capacity was found below pH 3.3, suggesting that the protein was acid-denatured. In the DSC measurements of the cooling and reheating processes after the first heating, no excess heat capacity curve was observed in the acidic region, suggesting that the heat denaturation of TtPRAI was not reversible

J. Takai et al. seems to remain at pH 3.1. Although the CD values at 220 nm at pH 3.1 are similar to those at pH 7.0, the negative values around 205 nm at pH 3.1 are significantly larger than that at pH 7.0 in the native state. The results of the CD and DSC measurements indicate that the structure of TtPRAI undergoes thermodynamically denaturation at pH 3.1, although the secondary structure still remains. This is in agreement with the characteristics of a molten globule structure already reported (35). Stabilization Due to Dimer Formation in TtPRAI-- The apparent denaturation temperature of TtPRAI from T. thermophilus, which is an extremely thermophilic eubacterium with a maximum growth temperature of 85°C, is around 100°C above pH 7 (Fig. 5). The stability of this protein might be comparable to or less than that of TmPRAI, because TmPRAI originates from a hyperthermophile, T. maritima, which has a higher maximum growth temperature of 90°C than that of T. thermophilus. Now, we can compare the stabilization factors of both proteins on the basis of their crystal structures. In the case of monomer structures, (i) the hydrophobic interaction (GHP) of TtPRAI is only slightly higher than that of TmPRAI (Table 4), (ii) the number of hydrogen bonds does not differ among the three proteins (Table 3), (iii) the number of ion bonds is slightly greater in the thermophilic proteins than in the mesophilic protein (Table 3), and (iv) the cavity volume of TtPRAI is greater than that of TmPRAI (Table 4). As compared with the mesophilic protein (EcPRAI), the thermophilic proteins (TtPRAI and TmPRAI) seem to be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and ion bonds. No large difference in stabilization between the thermophilic proteins was evident at the level of the monomer structures. At the subunit interface, however, hydrophobic interactions and a decrease in the cavity volume contribute less to the stability of TtPRAI than that of TmPRAI (Table 4). The number of hydrogen bonds in TtPRAI is slightly higher than in TmPRAI, but the number of ionic bonds is the same. These results suggest that the dimer form of TtPRAI is less stable than that of TmPRAI. From the present experiments, it is evident that the acid denaturation of TtPRAI correlates to the dissociation of a dimer form, and an intact monomer structure can not be maintained below pH 3.5. On the other hand, in the case of TmPRAI, based on sedimentation equilibrium and CD experiments, it has been reported that the protein with a molecular weight of a dimer form is not denatured at pH 3.2 (9). This implies that the TmPRAI is more stable than the TtPRAI at pH 3.2. This agrees with the above conclusion based on the difference in structures at the dimer interfaces of these proteins. Henning et al. (5) have proposed the possibility that the sequential hydrophobic residues (Pro51-Pro52-Phe53Val54) in loop 23 of TmPRAI, which protrude reciprocally into the interior of the -barrel of the neighbouring subunit, are responsible for the stability of the dimer. They found that only PRAI from the halophilic archaeon Halofearax volcanii among all PRAI sequences available at that time has the same hydrophobic amino acid sequence as PPFV of TmPRAI. Therefore, only "extremophilic" PRAIs seemed to be stabilized by dimerization via these residues. However, recently, when all PRAI sequences available in the Swissprot databank were

under the conditions of the experiment. Furthermore, when the scan rate of DSC was decreased at pH 3.7, the denaturation temperature also decreased: denaturation temperatures were 68.4, 66.5, and 63.0°C for scan rates of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25°C min­1, respectively. These results indicate that the denaturation of TtPRAI is quite slow and does not reach equilibrium. It has been reported that the denaturation rates of hyperthermophilic proteins are unusually slow (29­33). For example, the heat denaturation of pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus does not reach equilibrium even at a very slow scan rate of 1°C h­1, and is under kinetic control (34). TtPRAI from the extreme thermophile also has this common feature of hyperthermophilic proteins. CD Spectra of TtPRAI in the Acidic pH--In order to examine the state of the structure of TtPRAI around pH 3, CD spectra in the near and far-UV region were measured. Changes in the tertiary structure of a protein can be judged from the near-UV CD spectrum (from 250 to 320 nm), which originates from aromatic side-chains. Curve 3 in Fig. 7a suggests that the tertiary structure of TtPRAI is largely destroyed at pH 3.4 as compared with curve 1 at pH 7.0. However, the structure at pH 3.8 seems to be still intact because the CD spectrum is quite similar to that at pH 7.0, as shown in Fig. 7a. At pH 3.1, four negative peaks characteristic of the native state disappear (curve 4 in Fig. 7a), indicating that the native structure has become almost completely denatured. On the other hand, as judged from the spectrum in the far-UV region (Fig. 7b), a fairly high content of secondary structure

Dimer Form of Phosphoribosyl Anthranilate Isomerase aligned, it was found that the PRAIs from many mesophiles have the same sequence (LPPFV) as that (from Leu50 to Val53) of TmPRAI. Therefore, attempts were made to predict the tertiary structures of several PRAIs from mesophiles containing the LPPFV sequence by homology modeling using MOE software (Chemical Computing Group Inc.). All predicted structures could be superimposed very well with those of TtPRAI and TmPRAI at the dimer interface (not shown). These results suggest that these mesophilic proteins form homodimers and that the hydrophobic sequence LPPFV is not a unique characteristic of thermophilic proteins such as the TmPRAI. The sequence Leu49-Gly50-Pro51-Phe52-Val53 of TtPRAI corresponds to the LPPFV of TmPRAI. The Gly50 of TtPRAI is not observed in TmPRAI. Pro51 and Phe52 in the protrusion of TtPRAI seem to be the most important residues contributing to the dimeric structure, because they are trapped in the other subunit as shown in Fig. 1. Although this protrusion might be important for preserving the dimeric form, many other factors should also be responsible for the higher stability of the dimer in thermophiles as revealed by the differences in the stabilizing factors between TtPRAI and TmPRAI demonstrated in the present study.

The crystal structure of TtPRAI was solved at 2.0 Å resolution. The overall structure of TtPRAI is quite similar to that of TmPRAI with a dimeric structure. The TtPRAI also has a hydrophobic protrusion at the subunit interface, which is similar to that of TmPRAI. Therefore, in order to elucidate the role of the protrusion, the stability of TtPRAI has also been investigated by DSC, CD, and analytical centrifugation in the acidic range as it relates to the association-dissociation of the subunits. The denaturation temperature of TtPRAI in solution declined sharply with decreasing pH below pH 4.5. The tertiary structure was largely destroyed at pH 3.4. This denaturation of the protein at acidic pH was correlated with the dissociation of its dimeric form. On the basis of the crystal structures of proteins from mesophilic, extreme thermophilic, and hyperthermophilic organisms, we found that (i) the hydrophobic interactions of TtPRAI in the monomer structure are greater than those of EcPRAI and TmPRAI, but those at the dimer interface of TmPRAI are remarkably greater; (ii) the contributions of hydrogen bonds to stability among the three proteins are similar, but ion pairs in both thermophilic proteins contributed more to the stability than those in the mesophilic protein; (iii) destabilization due to the presence of cavities in TtPRAI is larger than that of TmPRAI in both the monomer and dimer structures; (iv) the higher stability of TmPRAI due to dimer formation is caused by increase in an area of hydrophobic interaction and a decrease in cavity volume at subunit interface as compared with TtPRAI.
