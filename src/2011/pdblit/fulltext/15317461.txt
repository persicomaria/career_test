Optimization of the screening hit 1 led to the identification of novel 1,5-naphthyridine aminothiazole and pyrazole derivatives, which are potent and selective inhibitors of the transforming growth factor- type I receptor, ALK5. Compounds 15 and 19, which inhibited ALK5 autophosphorylation with IC50 ) 6 and 4 nM, respectively, showed potent activities in both binding and cellular assays and exhibited selectivity over p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The X-ray crystal structure of 19 in complex with human ALK5 is described, confirming the binding mode proposed from docking studies.
Introduction Transforming growth factor (TGF- ) is a pluripotent cytokine involved in a variety of biological processes such as development, cell growth, differentiation, cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and immune response regulation.1 This cytokine regulates not only the ECM deposition in response to tissue injury, thus contributing to the healing process, but is also involved in pathological fibrosis.2 Indeed, TGF- overexpression has been implicated in multiple disease states including pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, renal glomerulosclerosis, and cancer.3-5 TGFbelongs to the TGF- superfamily, which includes in humans the three TGF- isoforms (TGF- 1, TGF- 2, and TGF- 3), the activins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins.6 TGF- 1 is the prototypic member of this family of cytokines that signals through a family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. These receptors can be divided into two classes, the type I or activin like kinase (ALK) receptors and the type II receptors.7,8 The ALK receptors are distinguished from the type II receptors in that they lack the serine/ threonine rich intracellular tail, possess serine/threonine kinase domains that are homologous between type I receptors, and share a common sequence motif called

the GS domain. The GS domain is at the amino terminal end of the intracellular kinase domain and is critical for activation by the type II receptor.9 Several studies have shown that TGF- signaling requires both the ALK and the type II receptors. Specifically, the binding of TGF- 1 to the type II receptor causes phosphorylation of the GS domain of the TGF- type I receptor, ALK5. The ALK5 receptor, in turn, phosphorylates the cytoplasmic proteins smad2 and smad3 at two carboxyl terminal serines. The phosphorylated smad proteins form heteromeric complexes of smad2, smad3, and smad4, after which the complex translocates into the nucleus to effect gene transcription.10 A program was initiated to identify small molecules inhibiting the TGF- signaling pathway. High throughput screening (HTS) of our corporate compound collection was carried out using a TGF- -dependent transcriptional assay, comprising a HepG2 cell line stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by the PAI-1 promoter. This screen identified the aminothiazole derivative 1 as a potent inhibitor of TGF- signaling (IC50 ) 429 nM). We describe below the optimization of 1 to give a series of high-affinity ALK5 inhibitors (Chart 1). A pyrazole compound 19 was cocrystallized with ALK5, and the structure of the complex was determined by X-ray crystallography. Results and Discussion Consideration of the structure of 1 strongly suggested that it might inhibit a kinase, and ALK5 appeared a likely candidate. Accordingly, an ALK5 autophospho-

rylation assay was constructed using the purified human ALK5 kinase domain produced in Sf9 insect cells. Aminothiazole 1 inhibited ALK5 activity in this assay with an IC50 of 274 nM. While presenting some structural analogy with p38 MAP kinase inhibitors,11 this compound did not exhibit p38 MAP kinase activity when tested in a relevant binding assay (IC50 > 16 µM). A chemistry program was initiated with the aim of increasing potency. To support the study of structureactivity relationships (SAR) within the series, a binding assay was set up in which the ability of the test compounds to displace a rhodamine green-labeled ligand from recombinant GST-ALK5 was measured. In this assay, 1 exhibited an IC50 of 724 nM. The compounds were evaluated in both the binding and the TGF- dependent cellular assay, and the most potent compounds were also tested in the ALK5 autophosphorylation assay. At the outset of this work, no structures of ALK5 inhibitors cocrystallized with the protein had been published. However, the crystal structure of an inactive form of ALK5 complexed to FKBP129 was available and this was used as a basis for docking studies. Binding Mode Hypothesis. On the basis of the crystal structure of the ALK5-FKBP12 complex, we carried out molecular modeling studies to support the medicinal chemistry program. Knowing that compound 1 inhibited ALK5 by occupation of the ATP binding site, the binding was ATP competitive (data not shown), and comparison of ALK5 with a range of other kinaseinhibitor complexes for which structural information was available enabled us to characterize residues that could interact with the ligand. Subsequent docking studies were performed to identify a potential binding mode of compound 1 (Figure 1). In the preferred model, the quinoline moiety interacts with the backbone of amino acids (residues 281-283) that links the N- and C-terminal domains of the kinase (hinge region), a region normally occupied by the adenine ring of ATP. The main hydrogen bond in this region links quinoline N1 and the backbone NH of His283. An analogous hydrogen bond acceptor-donor pair occurs in all inhibitor-kinase crystal structures and is also seen for N1 of adenine in ATP.

The N3 of the aminothiazole scaffold may interact with the side chain of Lys-232. This amino acid is included in the catalytic segment, and an equivalent hydrogen bond had previously been seen between p38 MAP kinase inhibitors and Lys-53.12 As Lys-53 is a highly conserved residue in the ATP binding site, this interaction is unlikely to contribute to selectivity. The pyridyl moiety is directed into the interior of the protein toward Ser-280 in the so-called "selectivity pocket", as established for p38 MAP kinase.13 This selectivity pocket is behind and orthogonal to the adenine binding site and is not utilized by ATP. Ser280 may be the key protein feature involved in inhibitor selectivity and is equivalent to Thr-106, the so-called "gate keeper" residue in p38 MAP kinase.12 These are the main residues governing the size and accessibility of the selectivity pocket. Only a limited number of kinases have threonine or serine as gate keeper residues, most having larger residues at this position, which are believed to block the formation of the pocket. SARs. In an attempt to increase the potency of this novel series of ALK5 inhibitors, the three heterocyclic subunits were modified in turn. To explore the selectivity pocket toward which the pyridin-2-yl is directed, the pyridine moiety was replaced by other aromatic groups (Table 1). The pyridin-3-yl analogue 2 showed a decrease in binding affinity, suggesting that the nitrogen atom of the 2-pyridyl ring might be involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein, even though this was not evident from the docking studies. In support of this supposition, the thiazol-2-yl compound 3 retained the potency of 1 in the binding assay. However, the 2-fluorophenyl analogue 4 also showed a similar level of binding affinity, so, clearly, an appropriately positioned nitrogen atom is not necessary for activity, although it remains possible that the 2-fluorophenyl group could participate in hydrogen bonding. Replacement of the 2-fluoro substituent by a 2-methoxy group 5 abolished the binding to ALK5. It was apparent from the docking studies that the pyridin-2-yl of 1 and the Ser-280 oxygen of the protein were in close proximity, with a distance of 3.21 Å measured between the pyridine centroid and the Ser-280 oxygen. This was suggestive of a possible electrostatic interaction, consistent with the observed activity of the 2-fluorophenyl analogue 4. To explore this idea further, the pyridin-2-yl ring was substituted with electron-withdrawing and -donating groups, some representatives of which are shown in Table 1. The electron deficient 5-chloro (6) and 4-chloro (7) analogues retained the binding affinity to ALK5, whereas the electron-rich 5-methyl derivative (8) showed a significantly decreased affinity. These results partly support the hypothesis that an unfavorable electrostatic interaction between the pyridine ring and the Ser-280 hydroxyl is exacerbated when the pyridine bears an electron-donating group as in 8, although, if this is the case, it is not clear why the electron deficient analogues 6 and 7 do not show enhanced affinity. The above compounds were tested in the TGF- cellular assay, and all showed decreased potency, so it appeared that the 2-pyridyl core was important for cellular activity. Accordingly, the pyridin-2-yl group was retained while modifications were made to the quinoline region of the series (Table 2). Replacement of the quinoline by a

naphthalene nucleus 9 abolished the binding to ALK5, supporting the hypothesis that the nitrogen atom of the quinoline 1 was engaged in an important interaction with the protein. Evaluation of a range of alternative heterocyclic systems using docking studies suggested that the naphthyridine system might be an appropriate replacement for the quinoline. In particular, two templates were selected based on their potential hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone NH of His-283. While incorporation of the 1,8-naphthyridine nucleus 10 was detrimental for binding to ALK5, the 1,5-naphthyridine 11 showed a 10-fold increase in binding potency as compared to 1. For the 1,8-naphthyridine 10, docking studies showed a good overlay with the quinoline 1. The distance between the N1 nitrogen of the 1,8-naphthyridine core and the backbone NH of His-283 was 2.74 Å, consistent with the desired H-bonding interaction. However, the close proximity of the N8 nitrogen and the backbone carbonyl of His-283 (distance of 3.82 Å) may be indicative of a repulsive interaction as compared with the quinoline 1, which might account for the loss

in potency. On the other hand, two parameters might explain the gain in potency for the 1,5-naphthyridine 11. First, the hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone NH of His-283 was maintained despite a shift of 1.13 Å for naphthyridine N5 as compared to quinoline N1. Second, the naphthyridine nucleus was more deeply embedded in the hinge region as compared to the quinoline, as illustrated in Figure 2. The quinolin-2-yl analogue 12 showed a 70-fold reduced binding affinity as compared to 11, demonstrating that the N5 nitrogen was key for optimal binding affinity. To explore the hinge region, which accommodates the naphthyridine nucleus, substitution at positions C6 and C8 was carried out. The C6-ethoxy analogue 13 showed a decreased binding affinity, whereas the C8-methyl analogue 14a retained ALK5 inhibitory potency (Table 2). The loss of potency on substitution at C6 can be explained by the location of the naphthyridine nucleus in a deep well-defined pocket of restricted size. Docking studies suggest an unfavorable interaction between the C6-substituent and the backbone carbonyl of Asp-281. The C8-methyl group of compound 14a, on the other hand, is directed toward the opening of the active site (Figure 2), so it is not surprising that this compound retained binding affinity. Interestingly, the

1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl analogue 14b presented a binding affinity comparable to 1. In this case, this is the N1 nitrogen of the 1,5-naphthyridine group that is involved in the hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone NH of His-283. Compounds 11 and 14a,b were more potent than 1 in the TGF- cellular assay. Compound 11 was also a potent inhibitor of ALK5 autophosphorylation (IC50 ) 20 nM), exhibiting a 10-fold higher potency than 1. On the basis of these encouraging results, further modifications were made to the pyridin-2-yl moiety, this time retaining the 1,5-naphthyridine core (Table 3). Introduction of a methyl at the C6-position led to an equipotent ALK5 inhibitor 15 with also a 6-fold increase in potency in the TGF- cellular assay. Replacement of the pyridin-2-yl ring with 4-fluorophenyl 16 or 3-chlorophenyl 17 retained the in vitro potency, showing that the selectivity pocket is able to accommodate small lipophilic groups such as methyl or chlorine. Although the binding affinity was maintained for the phenyl derivatives 16
Table 3. 1,5-Naphthyridine Aminothiazoles

and 17, this structural modification had an impact on selectivity vs p38 MAP kinase. Indeed, both compounds 16 and 17 exhibited significant binding affinity for p38 as compared to the pyridin-2-yl derivatives 11 and 15. To identify potent ALK5 inhibitors, we investigated other chemical series in parallel of this work, exploring the replacement of the central core by different heterocycles. We previously identified the pyrazole14 as an interesting scaffold to replace the aminothiazole core and decided to combine this modification with the 1,5naphthyridine template. More recently, pyrazole compounds were also described in the literature15 as potent ALK5 inhibitors. Both pyrazoles 18 and 19 showed similar enzyme inhibitory potencies to the corresponding aminothiazole analogues 11 and 15 with no loss in selectivity vs p38 MAP kinase (Table 4). This would appear to suggest that the ring nitrogen atom of the aminothiazole is more important for ALK5 inhibitory activity than the extracyclic amino group. Both pyrazoles presented cellular potency comparable to that obtained for the corresponding aminothiazoles. In addition, compound 19 was tested against a panel of kinases (Table 5) and did not present any inhibitory activity at 16 µM on these kinases. Binding Mode Description of Compound 19 in ALK5 from X-ray Crystal Structure. To determine with precision the binding mode and validate our previous hypotheses, a representative example of the naphthyridine series, compound 19, was cocrystallized with ALK5. The RMS deviation (backbone atoms) of the ALK5-FKBP12 complex active site is 1.14 Å from the ALK5-19 crystal structure active site indicating that the docking studies based on the ALK5-FKBP12 complex were indeed relevant to support the medicinal chemistry program. The main interactions suggested by the model were shown to be valid following examination of the cocrystallization structure. Moreover, additional structural characteristics, particularly in the selectivity pocket, shed interesting light on the SAR data as shown in Figure 3. Compound 19 binds in the ATP site with the 1,5naphthyridine N5 interacting with the backbone NH of His-283. Pyrazoles N1 and N2 are involved in hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp-351 and Lys-232,

respectively. In the X-ray crystal structure that was described by workers at Lilly for 4-[3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1Hpyrazol-4-yl]quinoline,15 the N1-Asp-351 hydrogen bond was not mentioned, while it was recently observed by another team for the same compound.16 As was suggested by Sawyer et al.,15 the flexibility of the Asp-351 side chain might play a key role in the ability of ALK5 to accommodate a range of inhibitors displaying a variety of steric profiles in the hinge region. Pyridine N1 forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule that also interacts with side chains of Tyr-249, Glu-245, and the backbone of Asp-351. This pyridine N1-H2O hydrogen bond may explain why a hydrogen bond acceptor group in this position is beneficial, as noted above. This water molecule, although located deep inside the active site, is surrounded by a polar environment, which may stabilize it (Figure 4). An analogous water molecule was observed in the crystal structures of aryl-substituted pyrazole ALK5 inhibitors15 but was not detected in the ALK5-FKBP12 complex. This may suggest that it is brought into the active site with the solvated ligand. Determination of a crystal structure of

an inhibitor without this hydrogen bond capability (for example compound 16 or 17) would help to test this hypothesis. Apart from this pyridine N1-H2O interaction, the ligand is not involved in other hydrogen bonds within this region. The 6-methyl substituent is located in a small, mainly hydrophobic, pocket (Figure 4). The pyridine ring is close to and parallel with the side chain of the Ser-280 (3.27 Å between the pyridine centroid and the oxygen of Ser-280). An overlay of crystal structures

of p38 and ALK5 shows that the hydroxyl side chain of Ser-280 is superposed on the methyl of Thr-106 but not its hydroxyl. As a consequence, the nature of the interaction with the inhibitor will be different between enzymes and this may explain the selectivity of this type of ALK5 inhibitor vs p38 MAP kinase. Two types of interactions seem to coexist in the region: the hydrogen bond with N1 of the pyridyl and an electronic interaction between the O of Ser-280 and the ring of the ligand. This may explain the SAR showing that either a pyridine or a phenyl, substituted with small electronwithdrawing groups, is necessary to optimize the interaction. Chemistry The quinolin-4-yl aminothiazole derivatives were prepared according to the general method described in Scheme 1. Lepidine 20 was condensed with the corresponding esters (R1COOEt) in the presence of potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in anhydrous THF in a range of temperatures between -50 and -78 °C to give the ketones 23-29. The 2-carbethoxy-5-methylpyridine 22 was prepared by carboethoxylation17 of 2-bromo-5methylpyridine in the presence of a catalytic amount of palladium acetate and 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) in a mixture of triethylamine/ethanol under a CO atmosphere. Subsequent bromination of the ketones 23-29 with bromine or polymer-supported pyridinium perbromide afforded the corresponding R-bromoketones, which were immediately reacted with thiourea to provide the aminothiazole compounds 1, 2, and 4-8. The same synthetic pathway was used for the preparation of the 1,8-naphthyridine 11 starting from 4-methyl[1,8]naphthyridine 21 (Scheme 1). The 4-methyl[1,8]naphthyridine was prepared in a one step synthesis applying the Skraup reaction to the commercially available 2-amino-4-methylpyridine as described in the literature.18 Another approach was followed for the preparation of compound 3 (Scheme 2). The commercially available 2-acetylthiazole was condensed with 4-chloroquinoline in the presence of sodium hydride to afford the ketone 31. Bromination and reaction with thiourea using the conditions previously described afforded the aminothiazole 3.

Alternatively, the ketone 32 was prepared by condensation of (1-naphthalenylmethyl) magnesium chloride with ethyl picolinate. This ketone was therefore reacted with bromine followed by thiourea to afford the naphthalene derivative 9 (Scheme 3). The 1,5-naphthyridine derivatives 11 and 13-19 and the quinoline 12 were prepared following the general pathway outlined in Scheme 4. The aminothiazoles 11 and 15 and the corresponding pyrazoles 18 and 19 were accessible from common ketone intermediates. The 1,5naphthyridines 36-39 were condensed with the commercially available esters of general formula (I) to give the corresponding ketones 41-46. Subsequent bromination followed by reaction with thiourea afforded the aminothiazoles 11 and 13-17. The same synthetic pathway was applied to 2-methylquinoline to give, from intermediate 47, the aminothiazole 12. On the other hand, treatment of the ketones 41 and 44 with N,Ndimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF,DMA) in the presence of acetic acid in DMF, followed by reaction with hydrazine monohydrate, provided the pyrazoles 18 and 19. The 1,5-naphthyridine derivatives 36-39 were prepared from the commercially available 3-aminopyridine

derivatives as described in Scheme 5. The 3-amino-6picoline 33 was readily converted to the known 2-methyl[1,5]naphthyridine 36 via a Skraup reaction,19 whereas the 3-amino-4-methylpyridine 34 was reacted with acetaldehyde to afford the 2,8-dimethyl[1,5]naphthyridine 37. The 2-hydroxy-6-methyl[1,5]naphthyridine 38 was obtained in the same fashion starting from 6-methoxy3-aminopyridine 35 and was next converted to the 2-chloro-6-methyl[1,5]naphthyridine 39 with POCl3. In the case where the 2,8-dimethyl[1,5]naphthyridine 37 was condensed with ethyl picolinate, a mixture of two isomers, 2-(6-methyl-1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl)-1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanone and 2-(8-methyl-1,5-naphthyridin2-yl)-1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanone, was formed and used directly in the next steps without purification. The separation of isomers was performed by chomatography on the final products 14a,b, after cyclization with thiourea. The structures of compounds 14a,b were assigned from NOE experiments based on the difference of the chemical shifts and 3J couplings of their respective Hb and Hd protons (Scheme 6). The small coupling

between Ha and Hb in compound 14a (respectively between Hg and Hi in 14b) and the large coupling between He and Hf in compound 14a (respectively between Hc and Hd in 14b) are characteristic for 1,5naphthyridines. Irradiation of the methyl group for compound 14a at  2.50 gave an enhancement of the proton Ha at  7.76, which is coupled with Hb at  8.85 (3J ) 4.52 Hz), while irradiation of the methyl group for compound 14b at  2.54 gave an enhancement of the proton Hc at  7.65, which was coupled with Hd  8.28, with a large coupling (3J ) 8.53 Hz). Conclusion Two novel series of ALK5 inhibitors were identified starting from a HTS based on a TGF- -dependent transcriptional HepG2 cellular assay. 1,5-Naphthyridin4-yl-substituted aminothiazoles and pyrazoles showed potent inhibition of ALK5 on both the enzyme and the TGF- -dependent cellular assays. Moreover, the pyridin2-yl derivatives 11, 15, 18, and 19 exhibited selectivity against p38 MAP kinase. The X-ray crystal structure

Experimental Section
All starting materials were commercially available and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out with the use of standard techniques under an inert atmosphere (Ar or N2). Organic extracts were routinely dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Solvent removal refers to rotary evaporation under reduced pressure at 30-40 °C. The analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on E. Merck 60-F254 precoated silica gel plates, and components were usually visualized using UV light, iodine vapor, or Dragendorff preparation. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel, Merck grade 60 (230-400 mesh). Melting points were determined on a hot-stage Kofler apparatus and are uncorrected. Proton NMR (1H NMR) spectra were recorded at ambient temperature on Bruker Avance 250 AC, 300 DPX, or 400 DPX spectrometers using tetramethylsilane as internal standard, and proton chemical shifts are expressed in ppm in the indicated solvent. The following abbreviations are used for multiplicity of NMR signals: s ) singlet, d ) doublet, t ) triplet, q ) quadruplet, dd ) double doublet, m ) multiplet, dd ) doublet of doublet, ddd ) doublet of doublet of doublet, and bs ) broad singlet. The mass spectra (MS) were recorded on a Helwett-Packard 5973 or micromass Platform-LC mass spectrometer using different techniques, including atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) or electrospray ionization (ESI). Analytical HPLC (system A) was conducted on a Chromolith Performance RP 18 column (100 mm × 4.6 mm id) eluting with 0.01 M ammonium acetate in water and 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN), using the following elution gradient: 0-100% CH3CN over 4 min, 100% CH3CN over 1 min at 5 mL/min. High-resolution mass spectra were determined on a micromass LCT. Analytical HPLC (system B) was conducted on a Uptisphere-hsc column (3 µm, 33 mm × 3 mm id) eluting with 0.01 M ammonium acetate in water and 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN) using the following elution gradient 0-5% CH3CN over 0.5 min, gradient 5-100% CH3CN over 3.25 min, and 100% CH3CN over 0.75 min. For compound 9, HPLC analysis was carried on a Agilent 1100 Series LC/MSD. Analytical HPLC (system C) was conducted using a Xterra MS C18 column (4.6 mm × 50 mm i.d) eluting with a mixture of water and acetonitrile (CH3CN) using the following elution gradient 5-100% CH3CN over 15 min at 1.8 mL/min. The purity of the compounds was determined on two analytic HPLC systems by UV detection. The following compounds were prepared according to literature procedures: methyl 4-chloropicolinate20 and methyl 5-chloropicolinate.21 Ethyl 5-Methylpyridine-2-carboxylate (22).

The docking experiments were performed using GOLD V1.122 in TGF- -FKBP12 complex. A single hydrogen bond constraint was added during calculations, guiding the quinoline N1 or naphthyridine N5 to interact with the protein backbone NH of His-283. The parameters were maintained as standard default GOLD V1.1 settings with the following exceptions. The floodfill radius, defining the active site search center, was increased to 12 Å. This radius was measured from a dummy atom located at the centroid generated from the heavy atom positions of five key residues: Lys-232, Leu-260, Ser-280, His-283, and Asp-351. Ten poses per ligand docking were saved, and the top scoring pose was taken to be the favored pose in the majority of cases. Only in the event of an obvious failure was the top pose discarded and an alternative, lower scoring pose selected. To ensure that a range of solutions was available for scrutiny, early termination was disabled. Visualization was performed with Sybyl 6.x (Tripos) and Insight II (Accelrys).

Potent and Selective TGF- Type I Receptor Inhibitors X-ray Crystallography: Crystallization of the Complex of Human ALK5 with Inhibitor 19. The kinase domain of ALK5 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in baculovirus-infected sf9 cells. After purification on glutathione Sepharose, GST was removed by thrombin cleavage and ALK5 was further purified on an ATP-Sepharose affinity column. The purified protein was concentrated to 9 mg/mL in the presence of inhibitor and was in a solution containing 50 mM tris, pH 8.0, 8% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. Crystals of ALK5 complexed with inhibitor compound 19 grew as a clump of needles in 3 weeks at 4 °C using the vapor diffusion method and a reservoir containing 20% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.2 M magnesium chloride. The crystals of the complex are orthorhombic, space group P212121, with cell constants a ) 42.07 Å, b ) 77.78 Å, and c ) 89.59 Å. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with a model consisting of coordinates for all protein atoms from residues 201 to 500 of human ALK5 from the published structure of the cytoplasmic domain of type I TGF- receptor in complex with FKBP12 (PDB code 1B6C). The structure was refined at 2.0 Å resolution. The final values for Rcryst and Rfree were 0.224 and 0.275. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, accession number 1VJY. ALK5 Fluorescence Polarization Binding Assay. Fluorescence polarization is a method that is well-documented in the literature.23 Kinase inhibitor compounds, conjugated to fluorophores, can be used as fluorescent ligands to monitor ATP competitive binding of other compounds to a given kinase. The increase in depolarization of plane polarized light, caused by release of the bound ligand into solution, is measured as a polarization/anisotropy value. Compound binding to ALK5 was tested on purified recombinant GST-ALK5 (residues 198503). Displacement of rhodamine green fluorescently labeled ATP competitive inhibitor24 by different concentrations of test compounds was used to calculate a binding pIC50. GST-ALK5 was added to a buffer containing 62.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM CHAPS (all reagents obtained from Sigma), and 1 nM rhodamine green-labeled ligand so that the final ALK5 concentration was 10 nM based on active site titration of the enzyme. Forty microliters of the enzyme/ligand reagent was added to 384 well assay plates containing 1 µL of different concentrations of test compound. The plates were read immediately on a LJL Acquest fluorescence reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation, emission, and dichroic filters of 485, 530, and 505 nm, respectively. The fluorescence polarization for each well was calculated by the Acquest and was then imported into curve fitting software for construction of concentration-response curves. ALK5 Autophosphorylation Assay. The kinase domain of ALK5 (Franzen, P. 1993) (amino acids 162-503) was cloned by PCR and expressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 cells system. The protein was 6-His tagged in the C terminus and purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+ column, and the obtained material was used to assess compound activity in an autophosphorylation assay. Purified enzyme (10 nM) was incubated in 50 µL of Tris buffer (Tris 50 mM, pH 7.4; NaCl, 100 mM; MgCl2, 5 mM; MnCl2, 5 mM; and DTT, 10 mM). The enzyme was preincubated with different concentrations of compounds (0.1% DMSO final concentration in the test) for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 3 µM ATP (0.5 µCi -33P-ATP). After 15 min at 37 °C, phosphorylation was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 2.5% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 5% -mercaptoethanol). The samples were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C and run on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed to a phosphor screen overnight. ALK5 autophosphorylation was quantified using a Storm imaging system (Molecular Dynamics). Cellular Assays to Measure Anti-TGF- Activity of ALK5 Inhibitors. The activity of compounds was tested in a transcriptional assay in HepG2 cells. The cells were stably transfected with a PAI-1 promoter driving a luciferase (firefly) reporter gene.25 The stably transfected cells responded to

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2004, Vol. 47, No. 18 4505 TGF- stimulation by a 10-20-fold increase in luciferase activity as compared to control conditions. To test anti-TGF- activity of compounds, the cells were seeded in 96 well microplates at a concentration of 35000 cells per well in 200 µL of serum-containing medium. The microplates were then placed for 24 h in a cell incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atm. The compounds dissolved in DMSO were then added at concentrations of 50 nM to 10 µM (final concentration of DMSO 1%) for 30 min prior to the addition of recombinant TGF- (1 ng/mL) (R&D systems). After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed by addition of 10 µL of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Inhibition of luciferase activity relative to control groups was used as a measure of compound activity. A concentration-response curve was constructed from which an IC50 value was determined graphically.
