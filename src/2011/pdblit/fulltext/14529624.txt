Abstract We have previously reported the scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging under buffer of the heme monooxygenase cytochrome P450 cam from Pseudomonas putida [Faraday Discuss. 116 (2000) 1]. We describe here the adsorption and STM imaging under buffer of complexes of a mutant of cytochrome P450 cam , K344C, and wild-type putidaredoxin (Pdx) on gold(111). The images of Pdx on its own on gold(111) are not uniform, presumably due to multiple orientations of protein adsorption because of the presence of five or more cysteines on the protein surface. STM imaging of a 1:1 mixture of P450 cam ­K344C / Pdx showed a regular array of pairs of different-sized ° proteins 20­25 A apart arranged in rows across the gold(111) surface which we attribute to the P450 cam / Pdx complex. The images of the pairs are more regular than those of Pdx on its own, probably as a result of complex formation with P450 cam partly overcoming the heterogeneity of Pdx adsorption. As far as we are aware this is the first report of STM imaging of a protein / protein complex, and the first direct observation of P450 cam / Pdx complex formation which is a key step in the catalytic cycle of P450 cam catalysis. The redox centers of ° the two proteins are ca. 20 A apart, too far for rapid intracomplex electron transfer. Whether the observed complex is competent for electron transfer or physiologically relevant is not known, and further work is in progress to elucidate the protein­protein interaction. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Introduction Since its invention, now nearly two decades ago [1], scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has become an essential tool for scientists working at the interface between various scientific disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, material science and environmental studies. The multidisciplinary application of STM stems from its ability to image samples under virtually all experimental conditions with high, even atomic resolution. Since its discovery in 1982 by Binnig and Rohrer, STM and other successive `non-optical' scanning probe microscopies (SPMs), e.g. atomic, chemical, magnetic, and electrostatic force, have been engaged at the forefront of science and interfacial research to examine those issues essential to future technological advances. Since water plays an integral part in protein tertiary structure, the advantages associated with the capability to

carry out molecular-level imaging of biomolecules under quasi-physiological conditions are enormous. The heme monooxygenase, cytochrome P450 cam , from Pseudomonas putida has been studied extensively [2]. Its high-resolution crystal structures have been reported (both substrate-free [3] and camphor bound [4]) and attention has been drawn to the dynamic nature of the structure [5]. The role of specific amino acid residues in P450 cam structure and function has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis [6,7]. We have chosen to work with a P450 cam mutant, MSS­K344C, in which all five cysteines on the enzyme surface have been substituted with alanine (MSS: Minus Surface Cysteines), and one cysteine is introduced at a surface residue, lysine­344. We have examined the complexes formed between this mutant and putidaredoxin (Pdx), the electron transfer co-factor protein. The formation of a complex between P450 cam and Pdx is an essential feature of electron transfer from the NADH co-factor to P450 cam . Pdx is a 12 kDa ferredoxin, with two potential interaction sites with P450 cam ; a hydrophobic patch with three valine residues (4, 6 and 98) and a negatively charged region comprising Asp 58, and four

Glu residues (65, 67, 72 and 77). Pdx has five surface exposed cysteines, Cys (39, 45, 73, 85 and 86). We accordingly report here the results of an STM study of complex formation between MSS­K344C and Pdx. We set out to capture and anchor the complex formed between these two proteins to a gold surface in a stable, predetermined orientation, such that high resolution images of individual complexes may be obtained.

3. Results

3.1. STM imaging of cytochrome P450cam MSS­K344 C
A STM image of the P450 cam MSS­K344C mutant on gold(111) is shown in Fig. 1. We reported previously that this combination of mutations resulted in regular patterns on the surface compared to a more amorphous pattern for the wild-type protein. We concluded that adsorption of the P450 cam protein in a uniform orientation was conferred by the unique surface cysteine residue at 344 [11]. Both the pattern and orientation of adsorption obtained in the present work closely resemble those already published though, if anything, the resolution achieved here appears higher. The P450 cam molecule is trigonal prismatic in shape [4]. As described previously, the STM images suggest that the K344C mutation directed the protein adsorption such that one trigonal face of the protein interacts with the gold surface, and the size of the imaged molecules is similar to that derived from the crystal structure [11]. The z-values are interesting in that higher than expected values (which reflect a higher tunnelling current) are observed in the region of the image where one may presume to find the heme prosthetic group. Whether this is indeed attributable to the heme, the iron or the sulphur of the proximal cysteine residue, has yet to be discerned.

2. Experimental

2.1. Materials and methods
All buffer components, solvents and other reagents were of AnalaR grade or the highest purity available. All buffer solutions used in enzyme preparation were filtered through sterile 0.22-mm filters prior to use. General DNA manipulation followed standard methods [8]. P450 cam and Pdx were expressed in E. coli, and purified according to literature methods [10]. The MSS­K344C P450 cam mutant C58A­C85A­C136A­C148A­C334A­K344C was prepared as previously described [9]. The purified proteins were stored at 220 8C in 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The storage solution for P450 cam also contained 1 mM camphor, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 50% glycerol. Dithiothreitol was included to avoid dimerization of the protein molecules via disulfide bond formation. Glycerol, camphor and dithiothreitol were removed immediately prior to experiments by gel filtration on a Pharmacia PD-10 column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4.

3.2. Putidaredoxin ( Pdx) 2.2. STM experiments
STM experiments were performed on a Molecular Imaging Pico STM instrument (Model MS300) with a `D' scanner (Molecular Imaging). Images were obtained in constant current mode. Gold substrates were prepared by evaporating gold (Goodfellow Ltd.) on freshly cleaved muscovite mica (Agar Scientific) at 250 8C under a pressure of 1310 25 bar and deposited at the rate of 0.2 nm s 21 . Substrates were annealed in a blue butane flame, quenched in air for a few seconds, then immersed in pure water (Aldrich 27-072-3) or 15 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 within the Molecular Imaging fluid cell. The fluid cell was soaked overnight in a mixture of 30% H 2 O 2 and 70% H 2 SO 4 (caution!), and then immersed in boiling Millipore water for at least 1 h prior to use. Tips were prepared by electrochemical etching of a tungsten wire (0.25 mm, Agar Scientific) in 3 M NaOH and coated in apiezon wax. For solution phase imaging, a freshly annealed gold substrate was exposed to a solution of 0.25 mM P450 cam MSS­K344C and 0.25 mM Pdx. The gold substrate was removed from the solution after 5­15 min, then immediThe STM images of Pdx on gold(111) obtained under buffer are shown in Fig. 2. The images are not particularly uniform, suggesting multiple adsorption orientations for Pdx. Heterogeneity in the adsorption orientation of Pdx on

a gold surface is expected because the protein has five surface cysteines from the NMR structure. The dimensions of the imaged molecules are broadly consistent with that ° ° expected from the NMR structure (2863 A)3(2062 A) [12]. Like the STM images of rubredoxin [13], higher than expected z-values are observed in the region expected for the iron­sulphur cluster of Pdx, perhaps on account of the iron and / or sulphur atoms.

3.3. Cytochrome P450cam /putidaredoxin complex formation
From a 1:1 mixture of P450 cam and Pdx in solution, the complex was deposited on the gold(111) surface. At low resolution, the STM images show a fairly regular array of proteins, apparently arranged in `pairs' (Fig. 3). Although not totally uniform, each component of a pair is approxi° ° mately 20­25 A apart, with each pair being 100610 A apart within a `row', and the row-to-row separation is ° 50610 A. We note that not all the pairs in the images have the same size, and the arrangement and alignment of the pairs across the whole image are not wholly regular. Control experiments show that the scan angle did not affect the results. There are a myriad of possible effects that may be responsible, e.g. topographic convolution with the scanning tip or tip-induced flattening of the soft, compressible protein molecules. However, one important factor may be the heterogeneity of adsorption orientation for Pdx on its own, which we attribute to the presence of multiple cysteines on the protein surface. This heterogeneity may also give rise a distribution of adsorption orientations for the P450 cam / Pdx complex on the gold surface. On an ideal gold(111) surface, adsorbed molecules should align along the lattice with overall threefold symmetry, rather than the rows observed for the P450 cam / Pdx mixture. In practice the ideal picture with threefold

symmetry is rarely observed because of, amongst other factors, the difficulties in depositing a perfect gold(111) surface and the fluid dynamics of sample addition. We also note that pairs of molecules could arise from double tips. However we only observe paired images when the protein mixture was imaged and not for the proteins on their own, except for the occasional protein dimer (vide infra). In addition, double tips should also give rise to paired images of the gold edges in the background. Such pairs are not observed and the edges of gold background are sharp. Furthermore, control experiments involving imaging of HOPG by the same tips used for the protein complex conclusively ruled out double tip effects. We conclude that the pairs observed in the images are not due to artefacts. At higher resolution, the pairs appear to be composed of

two different proteins (Fig. 4a), and we suggest that the larger one is consistent with P450 cam and the smaller one is Pdx. The `cross-section' of each complex, i.e. a section in the `xz-plane', is given in Fig. 4b and again is consistent with a protein­protein complex. For comparison an image of the dimer of cytochrome P450 cam MSS­K344C is shown in Fig. 5. A small number of these dimers are deposited under certain conditions, especially when a sample of the protein is left standing in the absence of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol. There are appreciable differences between the P450 cam dimers and the P450 cam / Pdx complex shown in Fig. 4. The dimer image is much more symmetric, both the image itself and the xz-section in Fig. 5b. From the images of the P450 cam / Pdx complex, the distance between the heme of the P450 cam and the Fe 2 S 2 ° cluster of Pdx is estimated to be 20­25 A, which is greater

° than what might be expected (10­15 A) for rapid electron transfer. The images of the complexes are not totally uniform across the whole population, and it is not yet possible to discern whether the observed complex is physiologically relevant or indeed competent for electron transfer. Further work on altering and defining the adsorption orientation of the complex is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.

4. Discussion Though there have been a number of studies [14­17] on the formation of a complex between P450 cam and Pdx,

many questions remain. In the absence of a crystal structure of the complex, most information is derived from molecular modelling [14], NMR spectroscopy [15], competitive binding experiments [16], and activity studies [17] of P450 cam and Pdx mutants with amino acid substitutions of surface residues. The regions of the surfaces of both P450 cam and Pdx potentially involved in complex formation have been inferred from these investigations but direct observation of the complex has not been possible. Very recently Sligar and co-workers reported studies on the P450 cam / Pdx complex using an optical biosensor [18]. To our knowledge, the STM images described here are the first for a protein­protein complex, and the first physical image of the P450 cam / Pdx complex. It is surprising that the STM images of the P450 cam / Pdx complex appear so uniform, bearing in mind the heterogeneity of the Pdx STM image. One explanation is that the binding of Pdx to P450 cam is sufficiently strong to overcome largely the heterogeneous binding of Pdx to the gold surface. The region on the surface of P450 cam thought to be responsible for interaction with Pdx consists of the residues Lys344, Arg72, Arg112 and Arg364 which form an area rich in positive charges on the proximal face of the heme. One proposed orientation of P450 cam / Pdx complex formation involves the negatively charged residues Asp58, Glu65, Glu67, Glu72 and Glu77 of Pdx. Other orientations have been proposed, including one which permitted the interaction between Trp106 and Asp38 of Pdx with Arg72, Arg112 and Arg364 of P450 cam . The resolution of the present images does not allow the different possibilities to be unambiguously distinguished. Further work is in progress to address this question. The distance between the heme of the P450 cam and the Fe 2 S 2 cluster of Pdx estimated from the images is greater than that expected for rapid electron transfer. Various factors would be expected to influence the dimensions of the complex, in particular the binding of both proteins to the surface and to each other as well as the resolution of the technique. Since the dimensions of the complex observed by STM were fairly reproducible, it is unlikely that different degrees of tip convolution are responsible. Though one does not necessarily expect the molecular dimensions of a surface-restrained hydrated enzyme to mirror those derived from diffraction methods, especially under the influence of the scanning probe (and the pressure generated by it in the tunnel gap), the reason for the difference in size measurements is not yet understood. The binding orientation of P450 cam to gold(111) is controlled by the presence of only one surface cysteine, but that of Pdx is uncontrolled because there are five cysteines on its surface. Because of this lack of control on Pdx adsorption, it is entirely possible that the orientation of the two proteins in the complex observed by STM in this study may not be physiologically relevant for the electron transfer reaction. Nevertheless the direct observation of a protein / protein complex by STM is of great scientific

interest. Further insight into the structure of the P450 cam / Pdx complex will have to await the examination of different mutants of both P450 cam and Pdx. For example, it will be interesting to examine the complex formed between P450 cam and the mutant of Pdx that lacks surface cysteines. In addition the redox state of the proteins may also exert a controlling influence on complex formation. This intriguing possibility is amenable to investigation and we look forward to reporting on the influence of the redox state on the formation and structure of the complex. The immobilisation of protein / enzyme molecules for biosensing applications has developed significantly over the past decade [19,20]. We are currently investigating the possibilities offered by site-directed mutagenesis as a means of more controlled P450 cam / Pdx complex immobilisation on a gold electrode leading, ultimately, to ordering of the enzyme and its attendant partner on the electrode surface.
