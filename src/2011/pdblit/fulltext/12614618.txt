The Arabidopsis thaliana protein AtHAL3a decarboxylates 40 -phosphopantothenoylcysteine to 40 -phosphopantetheine, a step in coenzyme A biosynthesis. Surprisingly, this decarboxylation reaction is carried out as an FMN-dependent redox reaction. In the first half-reaction, the sidechain of the cysteine residue of 40 -phosphopantothenoylcysteine is oxidised and the thioaldehyde intermediate decarboxylates spontaneously to the 40 -phosphopantothenoyl-aminoethenethiol intermediate. In the second half-reaction this compound is reduced to 40 -phosphopantetheine and the FMNH2 cofactor is re-oxidised. The active site mutant C175S is unable to perform this reductive half-reaction. Here, we present the crystal structure of the AtHAL3a mutant C175S in complex with the reaction intermediate pantothenoyl-aminoethenethiol and FMNH2. The geometry of binding suggests that reduction of the CavCb double bond of the intermediate can be performed by direct hydride-transfer from N5 of FMNH2 to Cb of the aminoethenethiol-moiety supported by a protonation of Ca by Cys175. The binding mode of the substrate is very similar to that previously observed for a pentapeptide to the homologous enzyme EpiD that introduces the aminoethenethiol-moiety as final reaction product at the C terminus of peptidyl-cysteine residues. This finding further supports our view that these homologous enzymes form a protein family of homo-oligomeric flavin-containing cysteine decarboxylases, which we have termed HFCD family.

entries in the ENZYME data base for this enzyme class (EC 4.1.1.-).1 Many representatives depend on cofactors including thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), biotin, pyruvate or pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). The decarboxylation of 40 -phosphopantothenoylcysteine (P PC) to 40 -phosphopantetheine (P P) is a key step in coenzyme A biosynthesis from pantothenate.2 For Escherichia coli, rat and horse this decarboxylase activity was first assigned to pyruvoyl-dependent enzymes.3 ­ 6 However, no gene encoding a pyruvoyl-dependent P PC decarboxylase could be identified and it was not clear how the pyruvoyl group could contribute to this reaction as there is no free amino group in the substrate. None of the proposed reaction mechanisms was verified.7,8

Plant PPC Decarboxylase AtHAL3a

Finally, two years ago it could be demonstrated that the P PC decarboxylases (EC 4.1.1.36)1 are not pyruvoyl but flavin-dependent enzymes. For E. coli, it was shown, that the NH2-terminal domain of the Dfp flavoprotein (the CoaC domain) catalyses the decarboxylation of P PC.9 Dfp is a bifucntional enzyme and also has P PC synthetase activity that resides in the COOH-terminal CoaB domain.10,11 Later it was confirmed that flavindependent decarboxylation of P PC also occurs in plant12 and human coenzyme A biosynthesis.13 The plant P PC decarboxylase AtHAL3a was originally identified as a flavoprotein related to plant growth and salt and osmotic tolerance.14 Plant and human P PC decarboxylases share the proposed P PC decarboxylase signature pattern with the CoaC domain of the Dfp proteins.15 However, there is also sequence homology with the LanD flavoproteins EpiD from Staphylococcus epidermidis and MrsD from Bacillus.9 Both enzymes catalyse the oxidative decarboxylation of peptidylcysteine residues to peptidyl-baminoethenethiol,16,17 a reaction involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotics epidermin and mersacidin. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified antibiotic peptides.18 The P PC decarboxylases and the LanD enzymes belong to a new family of flavoproteins which was named HFCD (homo-oligomeric flavin-containing Cys decarboxylases).9,19 HFCD proteins share conserved active-site residues, a new flavin-binding mode and are trimeric (AtHAL3a) or dodecameric proteins (EpiD, MrsD and Dfp). All members of this protein family characterised so far catalyse the decarboxylation of cysteine residues. The central point in characterising the HFCD proteins is to elucidate the exact role of the flavin cofactor for the decarboxylation mechanism. We had already proposed that the flavin cofactor oxidises the side-chain of the cysteine residue16 and that decarboxylation of cysteine residues occurs spontaneously via the thioaldehyde tautomer of the oxidised side-chain.9 The crystal structure of the active-site mutant EpiD H67N with a bound substrate peptide then revealed the surprising result that Ca ­ Cb dehydrogenation by FMN and subsequent tautomerisation does not take place. In contrast, the geometry of the enzyme ­ substrate complex suggested that the oxidative attack of FMN starts at the thiol, yielding directly the thioaldehyde intermediate.19 The detection of oxidatively decarboxylated reaction products for the homologous peptidylcysteine decarboxylases EpiD and MrsD was a direct hint that P PC decarboxylases also follow the mechanism "decarboxylation by initial oxidation", although the final product P P is not oxidised. Based on the crystal structure of EpiD H67N with bound substrate peptide19 and the crystal structure of AtHAL3a,20 a model for binding of P PC to AtHAL3a has been proposed.12 In this model binding of P PC involves a binding

clamp that is disordered in the absence of substrate. Using the unphosphorylated substrate pantothenoylcysteine (PC) and AtHAL3a proteins, in which residues of this substrate binding clamp were exchanged, it was possible to identify the proposed oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate by high-resolution mass spectrometry and UV ­ visible spectroscopy.21 It is reasonable to assume, that the decarboxylation mechanism is not dependent of the used substrate (PC or P PC), although the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate was not present in assignable amounts for P PC. We also suggested that Cys175 of AtHAL3a, which is conserved in the P PC decarboxylases but not the LanD enzymes, is responsible for reduction of the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate and/or re-oxidation of the flavin cofactor yielding the final product.21 The three-dimensional structures of AtHAl3a20 and EpiD19 have been determined but only the latter structure revealed the substrate binding mode and the reaction mechanism of LanD proteins acting on peptide substrates. To get insights into the binding mode of substrate and the reaction mechanism of P PC decarboxylases, we analysed crystals of the mutant AtHAL3a C175S soaked with PC. PC was oxidatively decarboxylated by this enzyme and due to the mutation of the catalytic Cys175 residue, re-oxidation of the simultaneously reduced cofactor FMN was not observed. Here, we present the high-resolution structure of AtHAL3a-C175S-FMNH2 with bound oxidatively decarboxylated PC (pantothenoylaminoethenethiol). Based on this crystal structure we propose a mechanism for re-oxidation of FMNH2 and reduction of the oxidised intermediate. The data presented here, together with recently published data9,16,17,21,22 confirm that the decarboxylation of cysteine residues in P PC decarboxylases is a flavin-dependent reaction, although there is no overall redox reaction.

Results and Discussion
Complex formation The mutant AtHAL3a C175S has been demonstrated to perform only one half-reaction, the oxidative decarboxylation of PC, but is unable to complete the reaction to form the decarboxylated product pantetheine.21 During this half-reaction FMN is reduced to FMNH2 (Figure 1). This property opened the possibility to analyse AtHAL3a in complex with this reaction intermediate, which has the ene-thiol group in common with the end product of LanD proteins like EpiD.16 As AtHAL3a decarboxylates both, PC and P PC, we used PC because of its higher availability and because the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate has already been characterised by highresolution mass spectrometry in this case.21

Figure 1. Reaction catalysed by AtHAL3a. The enzyme converts both PC (used in this study) and its 40 -phosphorylated derivative P PC, the native substrate. PC is oxidised to a thio-aldehyde intermediate that undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to form OxPC. In the wild-type enzyme this intermediate is reduced to pantetheine.

Attempts to co-crystallise AtHAL3a C175S with PC failed and therefore, we produced the complex by soaking crystals with PC in the cryo buffer. In crystals of space group P6(3) that were essentially isomorphous to those used for structure determination, the active site of the asymmetric monomer is completely exposed to the solvent along a large channel through the crystal.20 The substrate binding clamp proposed on the basis of the EpiD complex structure19 is disordered in the unliganded structure and not fixed by lattice contacts. Soaking times were varied between five minutes and two hours and concentrations of PC between 2 mM and 20 mM were applied. The progress of the reaction could be easily monitored by the disappearance of the bright yellow colour of the FMN cofactor upon reduction. Several data sets were measured to optimise the conditions. Finally, the best electron density was obtained by soaking a crystal of approximately 0.2 mm £ 0.2 mm £ 0.6 mm for 25 minutes in a 10 mM solution of PC. With lower concentrations of PC and/or prolonged soaking times almost no additional electron density was visible at the active site but at higher concentrations the crystals cracked and their diffraction quality decreased significantly. The substrate binding site is located in a cleft adjacent to the FMN cofactor formed by two

subunits of the trimer (Figure 2). Upon soaking crystals of the C175S mutant with PC a clear difference electron density was apparent for the substrate binding clamp and an elongated molecule compatible with the reaction intermediate. The highest electron density was observed at the sulphur atom of OxPC in the vicinity of FMN. The peptide carbonyl oxygen of the former cysteine residue defined the location of the peptide bond unambiguously. This peptide bond is coplanar with the moiety that contains the thiol group and that can be nicely interpreted as the CvC double bond of the intermediate OxPC in a cis conformation, which is also observed for the reaction product of EpiD.23 No electron density for a carboxylate group is present, proving the decarboxylation of the substrate PC. The bulky electron density of the branched pantothenate moiety is also clearly defined as well as the carbonyl oxygen of the second amide bond. The electron density can neither be fitted by the educt PC nor the final product pantetheine (that is formed by the wild-type enzyme but not the C175S mutant). As the observed electron density disappears after a prolonged soaking time (. one hour), we interpret this electron density as bound intermediate OxPC and not as the educt. The yellow colour of oxidised FMN reappears after about one day,

strate PC to the reduced enzyme. So, even in the presence of a large excess of substrate in the drop, the reduced enzyme-intermediate complex accumulates in a single-turnover. The crystallo° graphic temperature factor of OxPC is 49.3 A2 (Table 1), which is slightly higher than that of the ° protein on average (43.4 A2) but in a comparable range suggesting a high occupancy. The AtHAL3a C175-FMNH2 ­OxPC complex ° was refined with data to 2.2 A resolution and for comparison, the unliganded mutant structure was ° determined and refined using data to 2.0 A. The latter value corresponds to the determined resolution of the native enzyme20 (Table 1). The model of the unliganded structure includes residues Lys19 to Lys170 and Asn180 to Gln200. The complex structure comprises Arg18 to Ser199. The substrate binding clamp is completely defined with the exception of the side-chains of Arg172 and Tyr178, which are largely disordered and point into the solvent. Substrate binding site Based on the EpiD peptide structure we have defined the substrate binding clamp of AtHAL3a to include residues Pro168 to Met183.19 In the absence of substrate, the substrate binding clamp is ordered only up to residue Lys170 and for Asn180 and following residues. In the complex with the intermediate, the binding clamp forms a rather distorted antiparallel two-stranded b-sheet that embraces the OxPC molecule. The latter is tightly fixed by a number of contacts (Figure 3). With its carbonyl oxygen, the peptide bond of the original cysteinyl moiety forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Ala174 ° (2.8 A) and with its amide another hydrogen bond ° to carbonyl oxygen O4 of FMN (2.9 A). In addition, the ene-thiol group packs against the Ca atom and ° the backbone of Asn142 with a distance of 3.3 A between the backbone amide of Asn142 and the

therefore the bound molecule definitely interacts with reduced FMN. It should be noted that the enzyme concentration in the crystal is about 28 mM, e.g. comparable to that of PC in the mother liquor. Taken together, these observations suggest a fast reaction between the substrate and oxidised FMN that is essentially controlled by diffusion of PC into the crystal and an overall slow dissociation of the intermediate from the mutant enzyme. The fact that this density disappears after prolonged incubation suggests a rather low affinity of the sub-

Figure 4. Active site geometry. The reaction intermediate OxPC is bound by several hydrogen bonds (purple dotted lines). The peptide amide of Val30 forms a long polar contact with N5 of FMN. The CvC double bond between Ca and Cb of the former cysteinyl moiety can be reduced by direct hydride transfer from N5 of FMN and protonation of Ca by wild-type Cys175 (green dotted lines). In the mutant the side-chain of Ser175 is fixed by Asn142 and Asp177.

thiol of OxPC. The side-chain of Met145, a conserved residue, re-orients compared to the unliganded form to come into van der Waals con° tact with the thiol (3.7 A). The 20 -hydroxyl group of the pantothenoyl moiety forms a hydrogen ° bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Arg172 (3.0 A) and the carbonyl oxygen of the pantothenate amide forms one to the backbone amide of Met183 ° (3.0 A) that defines the C-terminal end of the substrate binding clamp. The 40 -phosphate of P PC will be located at the distal end of the binding cleft. Here, the clamp contains a number of basic residues including Lys171 and Arg172, and Lys34 could contribute to its binding. In addition to the four hydrogen bonds between OxPC and the clamp or FMN, numerous van der Waals contacts contribute to the binding. For example, these contacts include Val30 and the methyl groups of pantothenate or Ala182 and the amide group of pantothenate. The turn region of the binding clamp comprises Ala174 to Gly176 and harbours the mutation

Cys175Ser. It contacts the loop preceding Val88 of the neighbouring subunit (Figure 3). The sidechain of Ser175 is tightly fixed by hydrogen bonds ° ° to Asp177 (2.8 A) and Asn142 (3.1 A). Arg95 from the neighbouring subunit also contributes to the loop conformation as its guanidino group hydro° gen bonds the carbonyl oxygen of Ser175 (3.1 A) ° and a salt bridge to Asp177 (2.6 A). Upon reduction, the isoalloxazine ring remains essentially planar. A major change associated with the reduction of FMN is the side-chain reorientation of Ser29 located below the pyrimidine ring of FMN. In the oxidised state it hydrogen bonds the carbonyl oxygen of Ala140 and in the reduced ° state O4 of FMN (2.7 A). The water molecule located at the N1 ­C2vO2 locus of FMN (Figure ° 3) shifts by about 0.2 A towards the backbone amide of Asn108, which is located at the N terminus of an a-helix. It should be noted that this water molecule is structurally conserved in AtHAL3a and EpiD19 and well defined with low temperature factors. In AtHAL3a it functions as a

The helix forming the dimer contact to another trimer in the dodecameric EpiD is replaced by an insertion preceding His90 in AtHAL3a. The substrate binding clamp of AtHAL3a (light blue) is shorter by four residues compared to that of EpiD (red).

of substrate accommodates the thiol group. Interestingly, this cavity is not completely filled by the thiol sulphur, indicating that there is space to bind the educt and final product in different conformations as required by different hybridisation states of Ca and Cb of the cyteinyl moiety. Comparison with EpiD The accumulation of OxPC during the decarboxylation of P PC by AtHAL3a Cys175Ser clearly shows that the reaction catalysed by the wild-type can be divided into two parts, an oxidation reaction including a spontaneous decarboxylation and a reduction of the intermediate. AtHAL3a shares the oxidation of a terminal cysteine residue with the LanD protein EpiD.12,16 Figure 5 shows a superposition of EpiD with the bound pentapeptide substrate and AtHAL3a with the bound reaction intermediate OxPC. The major difference in positioning very likely arises from the absence of the carboxylate group in OxPC that allows a different orientation for the ene-thiolate group compared to the cysteinyl moiety of the educt. The educt complex of AtHAL3a might resemble the situation found in EpiD quite closely, as key residues are conserved between both enzymes, especially Asn142 (EpiD: Asn117) and Ile91 (EpiD: Ile68) that contact the carboxylate group and the methylene group of the cysteinyl moiety, respectively. The binding clamps and the inherent flexibility of the substrate molecules will allow repositioning of the substrate during the reaction very efficiently. However, the active site in AtHAl3a appears constricted by Val88 on the right side and a bit broader on the left side by the replacement of Asn14 and Asn115 in EpiD by Ala31 and Ala140 in AtHAL3a, respectively. In addition, the substrate binding clamp of AtHAL3a is shorter by four residues compared to EpiD. These findings argue that the binding site in AtHAL3a might be shifted slightly towards the pyrimidine ring. As also observed for OxPC, the ene-thiol group formed upon oxidative decarboxylation of the peptidyl-cysteine substrate is present in a cis conformation.23 Similar to OxPC in AtHAL3a, this ene-thiol moiety is expected to rotate in EpiD towards the cavity above the pyrimidine moiety of FMN. In fact, this position is favoured by flavoproteins, as typically an offset of ° about 0.2 ­1.1 A from N5 towards the C4a position is found for the substrate atom24 and the offset into the opposite direction in EpiD is rather unusual. A major difference near the active site results from the dodecameric assembly of EpiD being a tetramer of trimers that correspond to the assembly of AtHAL3a. The inter-trimer contact in EpiD is mediated by a 2-fold contact that contributes to the binding site of the pentapeptide and the dimethylbenzene ring of FMN. In AtHAL3a, this dodecamer contact is substituted by an insertion of eight residues that precede the

Figure 6. Proposed reaction mechanism. In the oxidative half-reaction a thiolate ion is stabilised by His90 and bound near the dimethylbenzene ring of FMN. Electrons are transferred by an SET mechanism from the thiolate to FMN and Cb is deprotonated. The resulting thioaldehyde intermediate decarboxylates spontaneously and tautomerisation leads to the formation of a cis ene-thiolate that binds to a cavity above the pyrimidine moiety of FMN. In that geometry OxPC can be reduced by direct hydride transfer from FMNH2 to the Cb atom and the concomitant protonation of the Ca atom by Cys175.

pivot for a slight clockwise rotation of the isoalloxazine moiety upon reduction. Concomitantly, the distance of N5 to the backbone amide of Val30 ° ° decreases from 3.8 A to 3.5 A, e.g. in the reduced enzyme N5, which is very likely protonated, forms a long polar contact. The angle N(Val30)­ N5 ­ N10 decreases from 1258 to 1178, in the range typically observed for a hydrogen bond donor at N5 (116­ 1708).24 This contact in the reduced enzyme might contribute to a destabilisation of the reduced state and thereby favour the reduction of the intermediate in the wild-type enzyme. In the ° complex the original Cb atom is located 4.0 A from a ° apart (Figure 4). N5 of FMN, the C atom is 4.2 A The angle Cb ­ N5 ­ N10 is 1148 whereas the angle Ca ­ N5 ­ N10 is 1328. It is known that during oxidative reactions the substrate atoms bind ° roughly 3.5 A in front of N5 with an angle to N5 and N10 in the narrow range of 96 ­1178.24 This supports the view that the double bond of OxPC can be reduced by direct hydride transfer from N5 of FMN to the Cb atom. In the absence of substrate the binding cleft is lined by a number of water molecules that are replaced completely by OxPC. Most prominent of these are three water molecules in a cavity above the pyrimidine ring of FMN, which in the presence

Figure 7. Sites of mutations studied in AtHAL3a.21 Mutants are either (almost) inactive (N142D, M145L), produce the intermediate OxPC and the product pantetheine (R95Q, A174V, A174S, D177N and G179A) or only the intermediate OxPC (C175S). The first group affects binding of the substrate and/or the oxidative half-reaction (red), the second shows a disturbed reductive half-reaction (green), whereas the third group is completely inactive in the reductive half-reaction (blue). The conformation of the binding clamp around the ACGD-motif is defined by a number of hydrogen bonds between Asn142, Ser175, Asp177 and Arg96.

invariant His90/His67. This region provides van der Waals contacts to the binding clamp from Gly85 to Val88. Interestingly, this insertion is of identical length in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein SIS2, which is still uncharacterised with respect to structure and function. However, Dfp is dodecameric like EpiD9,15 and has an insertion of four residues. This may indicate a similar constriction of the cavity above the dimethylbenzene ring to which the C-terminal Cys of the EpiD substrate binds as the one caused by Val88 in AtHAL3a. Reaction mechanism--oxidative decarboxylation The decarboxylation of P PC by the bifunctional Dfp enzyme, which also harbours P PC synthase activity,10 and by AtHAL3a have been studied in detail.12,15 A mechanistic study on Dfp22 supports a reaction scheme similar to that proposed for EpiD.19 The authors found a very small primary deuterium isotope effect at the Ca position of the cysteinyl moiety and a primary isotope effect at Cb. These results further support our view that the initial oxidation reaction does not involve a deprotonation of Ca or a hydride transfer from either Ca or Cb to FMN. An induced charge-transfer band in the absorption spectrum at 560 nm demonstrates proximity of a thiolate anion to FMN for the substrate and the product complex. This can be stabilised by the strictly conserved His90/His67 as a general base, which we discussed previously.19 It has also been suggested that the electron transfer from the thiolate to FMN can be either mediated by an SET mechanism or via a thiol-C4a flavin adduct.22 In the complex of AtHAL3a with OxPC the sulphur atom is located in a cavity above the pyrimidine moiety of FMN, also present in EpiD, near the C4a position of FMN with a distance of

° 3.5 A, which represents a close van der Waals contact. Our present crystallographic study clearly shows only a van der Waals contact between the sulphur and C4a in the reduced enzyme. However, PC will have to adopt a different conformation due to the presence of the carboxylate group, which is further away from the C4a position similar to the educt in the EpiD complex. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume that the educt complexes of EpiD and AtHAL3a are rather similar and that the oxidative half-reactions follow a similar mechanism. The formation of a thiol-C4a flavin adduct is impossible for EpiD, as the offset of the thiol from N5 is towards the ° dimethylbenzene ring with a distance of 4.7 A between C4a and the thiolate sulphur,19 supporting an SET mechanism for electron transfer (Figure 6). Reaction mechanism--reduction of the intermediate The reductive half-reaction could either act on the ene-thiolate or on the thio-aldehyde tautomer of the ene-thiol form. Both variants involve a hydride transfer from N5 of the reduced FMN to Cb of the bound substrate. The active site geometry (Figure 4) shows that this can easily occur as the ° distance Cb to N5 of 4.0 A and the angle Cb ­N5 ­ N10 of 1148 are in the observed ranges.24 Our proposed mechanism is based on the formation of a metastable thioaldehyde intermediate during the oxidative half-reaction and its spontaneous decarboxylation to an aminoene-thiolate group (Figure 1). As this chemical group is quite stable with a low pKa value of about 6.025 we propose that OxPC is a true intermediate of the reaction, bound as an ene-thiolate, and that it is most likely the substrate for the reductive half-reaction. A tautomerisation to a thio-aldehyde during the

200

reductive half-reaction would require a protonation of Ca before hydride transfer whereas in the case of the reduction of the CvC double bond protonation would occur after or concomitantly with a hydride transfer to Cb. A hydride transfer to the sulphur of a thioaldehyde tautomer and the protonation of Cb appear less likely, although it is possible from geometric considerations as the ° distance of S to N5 is in the typical range of 3.6 A. However, the angle S ­ N5 ­ N10 of 918 is lower than the range of 96 ­1178 typically observed. The turn region of the substrate binding clamp is formed by the conserved ACGD motif. Its conformation depends on a hydrogen bond network that involves the side-chain of Ser175-Cys175 in the wild-type to Asn142, Asp177 and Arg95 (Figures 4 and 7). Mutations at these sites strongly influence the enzyme activity supporting the importance of this contact.21 In that geometry, the active site is completely shielded from the solvent. The only accessible proton source in vicinity of Ca or Cb of OxPC is the thiol group of Cys175 of the wildtype enzyme. This strongly supports the view that Cys175 functions as a proton source during the reduction of the substrate. Protonation by a specific residue during the reduction of a CvC double bond by flavoproteins has been observed for the old yellow enzyme family that reduces a,bunsaturated carbonyl compounds.26 There, the Ca is protonated by a Tyr residue and the N5-hydride goes to Cb. In summary, our structural results suggest that the oxidative half-reaction is essentially identical to that performed by EpiD, most likely by an SET mechanism involving a transfer of electrons from the thiolate group to FMN, and that the reductive half-reaction involves a direct hydride transfer to the Cb atom of OxPC and a protonation of Ca by Cys175 (Figure 6). Mutations influencing the reaction A number of mutants of AtHAL3a have been studied that influence its catalytic activity.21 Some of them are (almost) inactive, others produce both significant amounts of OxPC and small amounts of the final product, while only Cys175Ser produces exclusively the intermediate OxPC (Figure 7). Inactive mutants are probably defective in substrate binding and/or the oxidative halfreaction (Asn142Asp and Met145Leu; however we could not exclude that small amounts of OxPC are formed), those that produce the intermediate in significant amounts in addition to varying amounts of the product show a disturbed reductive half-reaction (Arg95Gln, Ala174Val, Asp177Asn and Gly179Ala), probably due to a more or less distorted binding geometry that results in a premature release of the intermediate. As predicted by the EpiD substrate structure, Asn142 is essential for substrate recognition and is predicted to bind the carboxylate and peptide amide of the cysteinyl moiety (Figure 5). Met145

forms a crucial van der Waals contact to the pyrimidine ring of FMN. Mutations at Arg95, Ala174, Cys175, Asp177 and Gly179 of the substrate binding clamp show the formation of the intermediate OxPC, but only Cys175Ser shows no product. These data indicate that mutants in the substrate binding clamp strongly affect the reductive halfreaction. Therefore, these residues, especially the turn region of the binding clamp including the conserved ACGD motif, are essential to ensure a precise geometry of the intermediate to allow efficient hydride transfer from FMNH2 to the intermediate. Another explanation could be that one of these residues has a specific function during the reductive half-reaction. The latter can be true for Cys175, as in the mutant Cys175Ser only Ser175 contacts the CvC double bond of OxPC. The disruption of crucial contacts as seen in our crystal structure is expected to critically influence the conformation of the loop harbouring Cys175. Especially the formation of both product and intermediate by the mutant Arg95Gln argues that the observed conformation indeed represents the active site geometry for the reductive half-reaction. The isosteric mutation Cys175Ser obviously does not disturb the interaction with the substrate PC, as the oxidative decarboxylation reaction occurs. In analogy to EpiD, it can be proposed that Cys175 and Asn142 form hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate group of the cysteinyl moiety of PC and Asn142 binds the peptide nitrogen (Figure 5).

Conclusion
We could demonstrate that two subgroups of the HFCD family, the LanD proteins including EpiD, and the P PC decarboxylases including AtHAL3a, share general principles of substrate recognition and conversion. The substrates have a terminal cysteine residue in common and are embraced in an almost extended conformation by a substrate recognition clamp that is disordered in the absence of ligands. The major difference in the reaction products arises from the ability of the P PC decarboxylases to reduce the primary reaction product, an ene-thiol moiety, in a second half-reaction to form the ethylthiol-moiety of the cysteamine residue. This ability is ascribed to the function of a cysteine residue in the substrate recognition clamp of P PC decarboxylases as a proton source and to the precise positioning with respect to the flavin N5 atom that enables efficient hydride transfer from FMNH2 to the CvC double bond of the intermediate.

Materials and Methods
The AtHAL3a mutant C175S was expressed in E. coli and the recombinant protein was purified21 and crystallised20 essentially as described earlier but without reducing agents. Obviously C175, which is located in a flexible loop structure, is responsible for the formation

of higher aggregates of the wild-type under oxidising conditions. These could be easily detected by analytical gel permeation chromatography, whereas the C175S mutant was monodisperse. The purified protein was of greenish colour. The substrate pantothenoylcysteine was prepared as described.9 For crystallisation, 2 ml of the protein solution at a concentration of 10 mg ml21 in 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5) were mixed with 2 ml of 1.4 M ammonium sulphate in 100 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 6.3) and equilibrated over the same buffer. Hexagonal crystals of space group P6(3) grew within one week to a maximum final size of 0.2 mm £ 0.2 mm £ 0.6 mm. Crystals had a bright yellow colour. For data collection crystals were transferred into a cryobuffer containing 2 M ammonium sulphate in 100 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 6.3) and 30% (v/v) glycerol. For complex formation crystals were first transferred to the cryo-buffer and incubated for 15 minutes and then soaked in cryo-buffer containing freshly dissolved pantothenoylcysteine until the colour of the crystals had turned into a faint yellow. Data sets of the substrate-free structure and of the complex were measured at 100 K using an Oxford cryo-stream. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MarResearch imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray generator, operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. Diffraction data were evaluated with the HKL suite27 and CCP4 program suite.28 The crystal structure of AtHAL3a provided the starting set of coordinates.20 Model building was done with the program MAIN.29 The structures were refined with CNS30 using a test set of 5 % of the reflections for cross-validation using the maximum likelihood target using amplitudes. The structures display good stereochemical parameters as estimated by the program PROCHECK.31 Figures were prepared with BOBSCRIPT.32 PDB accession numbers The coordinates have been deposited with the PDB under accession codes 1MVL and 1MVN.
