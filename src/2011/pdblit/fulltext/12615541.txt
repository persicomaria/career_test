The three-dimensional structure of ferredoxin, puri®ed from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, was determined in aqueous solution by two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition to the 946 distance constraints from nuclear Overhauser effect connectivities, we added 241 distance constraints derived from the crystal structure of Spirulina platensis ferredoxin to the 19 residues close to the [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur center, where crosspeaks disappeared due to paramagnetic effects. The atomic root-mean-square difference of the ten Ê converged structures from the mean structure was 0.61(Æ0.12) A for backbone atoms (N, Ca, CH ). The main-chain structure was almost the same as the crystal structures of other mesophile ferredoxins, but comparison of the side-chain structures revealed an extension of the hydrophobic core, a unique hydrophobic patch on the surface of the large b-sheet, and two unique charge networks in this thermostable ferredoxin structure, some of which might contribute to thermostability.

Introduction
Ferredoxins are soluble iron-sulfur proteins present universally in all organisms. Ferredoxins contain either one or two [4Fe-4S] clusters (or a 3Fe variant of this cluster) or one [2Fe-2S] cluster. Plant-type ferredoxins carry one [2Fe-2S] cluster and are involved in photosynthetic electron transport in higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria. They distribute electrons from the photosystem I to electron donors in various important reactions, including not only NADP reduction related to carPresent address: S.

bon assimilation, but also nitrite reduction for nitrogen assimilation, sul®te reduction, glutamate synthesis and thioredoxin reduction for metabolism regulation (for a review, see Knaff & Hirasawa, 1991). Plant-type ferredoxins have been sequenced for more than 70 plants, algae and cyanobacteria. Some [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin homologs, such as putidaredoxin and adrenodoxin, act as electron donors of cytochrome P-450 in non-photosynthetic organisms. Crystal structures have been determined for four ferredoxins from three mesophilic cyanobacteria: Spirulina platensis (Fukuyama et al., 1980, 1995; Tsukihara et al., 1981), Aphanothece sacrum (Tsutsui et al., 1983; Tsukihara et al., 1990) and Anabaena 7120 (Rypniewski et al., 1991; Jacobson et al., 1993), and one ferredoxin from ®eld horsetail Equitum arvense (Ikemizu et al., 1994). Recently another ferredoxin isolated from the halophilic archaebacterium in the Dead Sea Haloarcula marismortui has also been solved crystallographically (Frolow et al., 1996), which elucidated mechanisms of salt tolerance. NMR studies were also done in detail about the two types of ferredoxin of Anabaena 7120 (Oh & Markley, 1990; Chae et al., 1994). However, the

resonances of protons close to the paramagnetic iron-sulfur center were broadened, so solution structure calculation has been dif®cult. A low-resolution NMR-derived model of putidaredoxin, a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin homolog in Pseudomonas, was determined (Pochapsky et al., 1994), but the sequence homology with plant/cyanobacterial ferredoxins is very low. The history of studies on the origins of thermostabilities of ferredoxins goes back to more than 20 years ago (Tanaka et al., 1973; Perutz & Raidt, 1975; Hase et al., 1976b) owing to the number of known sequences and the easy detection of denaturation by color. Perutz & Raidt (1975) suggested that the thermostability of two 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins derives mainly from external salt bridges linking residues near the N terminus to others near the C terminus. [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins from three thermophilic cyanobacteria and one red alga have been sequenced. For example, the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus grows rapidly around 55 C, and the denaturation temperature of its ferredoxin is 76 C (Koike & Katoh, 1979), 25 C higher than that of Sp. platensis ferredoxin. Hase et al. (1983) discussed mainly salt bridges which may contribute to thermostability of ferredoxins from the thermophilic cyanobacteria Sy. elongatus and Mastigocladus laminosus. Because the actual structures of thermostable ferredoxins were not known, this discussion was made based on the structure of Sp. platensis ferredoxin. Although the above studies concentrated on salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, recent studies emphasize contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the stability of globular proteins (Matthews, 1993). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments in Anabaena 7120 ferredoxins (for a review, see Holden et al., 1994) were applied to alteration of protein stability recently (Hurley et al., 1995). Here, we report the solution structure of ferredoxin from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Sy. elongatus and discuss determinants of thermostability. The resonances from the protons close to the iron-sulfur center could not be observed, but this region was small enough and its amino acid sequence is almost perfectly conserved among ferredoxins. So we added the constraints derived from the corresponding part of the crystal structure of Sp. platensis ferredoxin (Fukuyama et al., 1995). As all the candidates of the determinants of thermostability were observed in two-dimensional NMR spectra, the structure determined in the present study was useful enough for discussions on the origins of thermostability. Moreover, this structure would be useful in the future for the interaction with the photosystem I reaction center membrane protein complex, whose structure is now being elucidated (Krauss et al., 1993, 1996). At the end of this paper, our structure is compared with another NMR structure of the same molecule published recently (Baumann et al., 1996), since their structure and discussion were totally different from ours.

In the case of proline residues, CdH protons are used instead of NH protons. NOEs are classi®ed into strong, medium and weak according to the height of the ®lled bar underneath the sequence. The asterisk indicates the NOE that cannot be de®ned since glycine residues have no CbH protons. The character X indicates the NOE that is not clearly observed due to overlapping with other NOE peaks.

Results
Assignments and structure determination Sequence-speci®c resonance assignments of ferredoxin were achieved (Figure 1) with the twodimensional NMR measurements according to È the conventional method (Wuthrich, 1986). We also referred to the chemical shifts of ferredoxin from the mesophilic cyanobacterium Anabaena 7120 vegetative cells (Oh & Markley, 1990). Since even a small fraction of denatured ferredoxin can deteriorate NMR spectra by releasing paramagnetic iron ion, thermostability of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin was essential for the quality of spectra. We were able to observe easily and assign surely even the crosspeaks from Thr90 OgH and Cys86 SgH at 6.54 and 2.45 ppm, respectively, in all of the spectra, although OH and SH protons of proteins have been reported as rarely observed owing to exchange with solvent protons È (Wuthrich, 1986). The crosspeaks from Thr90 OgH were so intense that they were almost misassigned as those from NH of an alanine residue. Although we obtained spectra of good quality, resonances for 21 residues, Leu26, Pro37 to Ala49, Gln62 to Phe64 and Leu76 to Val79, were not observed in two-dimensional NMR spectra. Their distribution was restricted to the region expectedly close to the paramagnetic iron-sulfur center, as reported with the vegetative cell ferredoxin from Anabaena 7120 (Oh & Markley, 1990). The primary sequence of the region where we could not observe resonances was almost perfectly conserved among ferredoxins from normal cells of different cyanobacteria, with a single exception of replacement of Phe38 by Tyr. Therefore, we as-

924 sumed that the tertiary structure of this region is also conserved. We calculated interproton disÊ tances from 1.8 to 5 A among the 19 residues, Pro37 to Ala49, Ser63, Phe64 and Leu76 to Val79, where the resonances of NH or CaH disappeared, on the basis of the model made from the crystal structure of Sp. platensis ferredoxin. Then only those from atom pairs separated by more than one residue were used as the upper limit constraints, both for the iterative structure calculations for NOESY peak assignment, and for the ®nal structure calculations. The NOESY peak assignments were obtained using our laboratory-made programs for semiautomatic NOESY cycles (Hatanaka et al., 1994). The above constraints derived from the Sp. platensis ferredoxin crystal structure was a great help to producing low-resolution structures of correct folding in the ®rst-step calculations. But we did not refer any other parts of crystal structures during the NOESY peak assignment. Using 1187 distance constraints, we obtained 40 converged structures starting from randomly generated initial structures, and selected ten computationally converged structures with the smallest sum of the two target function terms of distance constraints and van der Waals repulsion (Kohda & Inagaki, 1992). A summary of the structural statistics for a set of the ®nal structures and for the mean structure is presented in Table 1. There were few distance constraints which were violated by Ê more than 0.3 A in each structure. The deviation

Ê from ideal bond lengths was 0.003 A. These facts imply good quality of the structure, considering that our distance constraint set was tighter than those in the typical three-level classi®cation (Kohda et al., 1994). Structure description Figure 2(a) shows the results of the tertiary structure determination of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin. The root-mean-square difference (RMSD) value of the ten ®nal structures from the minimized averaged Ê structure was 0.61(Æ0.12) A for the backbone atoms (N, Ca, CH ) of all residues 1 to 97, and Ê 1.02(Æ0.18) A for the non-hydrogen atoms. The residues 1 to 36, 50 to 62, 65 to 75 and 80 to 97 (blue), where only the NOE constraints were used, could be superposed to the mean structure with Ê the (N, Ca, CH ) RMSD value of 0.64(Æ0.13) A, and the other residues 37 to 49, 63 to 64 and 76 to 79 (green), where the constraints from the crystal structure of Sp. platensis ferredoxin were added, were superposed with the RMSD value of Ê 0.18(Æ0.04) A. Figure 2(b) shows a ribbon diagram of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin structure in stereo. The large b-sheet was constructed by the four strands of the residues 2 to 10, 13 to 21, 51 to 53 and 84 to 90. This b-sheet carried on one side the longest a-helix 25 to 32 and the other secondary structure elements, namely, two a-helices 67 to 72 and 94 to 97, and one small b-sheet made of two strands 56 to 59 and 80 to 83. The general folding of this ferredoxin was almost the same as the crystal structures of other [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins, although structural description of these minor elements varies with the authors. We judged the secondary structures by backbone dihedral angles. All of the secondary structures were located inside the region determined by the NOE constraints. We also made structural calculations using only NOE constraints, that is, without the extrinsinc constraints from X-ray structures (Figure 2(c)), and Ê obtained the RMSD values of 0.81(Æ0.12) A for the residues 1 to 36, 50 to 62, 65 to 75 and 80 to 97, while the regions which had no distance constraints were perfectly disordered. Inside this region, the mean structure of the latter calculation set could be superposed to the former mean strucÊ ture with the RMSD value of 0.84 A. These results mean the structures of this region were determined independently from the modeled region around the iron-sulfur cluster. Figure 3 gives the variations of the number of distance constraints (a) and RMSD values (b) with the residue number of ferredoxin. The open bars in Figure 3(a) show the numbers of the constraints derived from the crystal structure of Sp. platensis ferredoxin. The large RMSD values at the residues 1 to 2, 10 to 14 and 31 to 35 were due to the small number of distance constraints from long-range NOEs. The reason for the large values at residues 91 to 97 is the displacement of whole helices.

hSAi refers to the ®nal set of simulated annealing structures, and (SA)r is the mean structure. The number of terms is given in parentheses. a The set of upper bound distance constraints obtained (see Materials and Methods) is tighter than in the usually used Ê three-level classi®cation (e.g. strong < 2.8 A, medium < Ê Ê 3.5 A and weak < 5.0 A). Hence, a few violations greater than Ê 0.3 A remain, but posed no problems. b The value of the square-well NOE potential, FNOE, is calcuÊ lated with a force constant of 50 kcal/mol per A2. The value of Ê Frepel is calculated with a force constant of 4 kcal/mol per A2 with the van der Waals radii scaled by a factor of 0.8 of the standard values used in the CHARMm empirical function. c EL-J is the Lennard-Jones van der Waals energy calculated with the CHARMm empirical energy function (Brooks et al., 1983), which was not included in the simulated annealing calculations. d The improper torsion term is used to maintain the planar geometry and chirality.

Discussion
Backbone structure comparison with mesophilic [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins Figure 5 compares the main-chain folding of the Sy. elongatus ferredoxin and other ®ve mesophilic ferredoxins, Sp. platensis (Fukuyama et al., 1995), A. sacrum (Tsukihara et al., 1990), Anabaena 7120 (Rypniewski et al., 1991; Jacobson et al., 1993) and E. arvense (Ikemizu et al., 1994). We superposed the Cas of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin residues 2 to 10 and

12 to 97 to the corresponding Cas of other ferredoxÊ ins, and obtained RMSD values 1.3 to 1.9 A, which indicates the extent of structural similarity. There were minor differences among ferredoxin backbones at three sites. The loop length between the ®rst two b-strands is variable, and the structure of this loop is ¯uctuated by insertions or deletions. Structural variability at the C terminus is caused by swinging displacements of the whole helical loop. In the structure of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin, the residues of the RMSD values are high around these two variable regions, which made the differences somewhat ambiguous. The third variable site is located around Leu65, and the segments from A. sacrum and Sy. elongatus are shifted away from the other four ferredoxins at this site. Since the amino acid sequence around this site is extremely conserved, this difference may be related to such artifacts as crystal packing or qualities of structure re®nements. In the case of Sy. elongatus, it might have been produced by the loss of distance constraints between the region of NOE constraints and the region of extrinsic constraints, since this site includes borders of the two regions. Contribution of hydrophobic interaction to thermostability Since we could not detect any signi®cant differences for the backbone structure, we investigated the interactions of the side-chains.

We used the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977; Abola et al., 1987) entries 4FXC, 1FXI (Molecule A), 1FXA (Molecule A), 1FRD and 1FRR (Molecule A), respectively.

Sacrum (Hase et al., 1976a), Anabaena 7120 vegetative cells È (Alam et al., 1986), Anabaena 7120 heterocysts (Bohme & Haselkorn, 1988) and E. arvense (Hase et al., 1977) .

which constitute the hydrophobic core was determined more precisely than hydrophilic residues on the surface of the molecule. Figure 6(a) shows the mode of packing of Ile17, Val19, Ile25 and Val28. The conformation of these side-chains was determined precisely. In many mesophilic ferredoxins, Ala occupies the position of Val28, and in some mesophiles including Sp. platensis, Cys replaces Val19, although A. sacrum ferredoxin has the same four residues. These residues link the largest a-helix and the second b-strand, and extend the hydrophobic core of the molecule, and therefore these substitutions may raise the thermostability of ferredoxin. Figure 6(b) shows the position of Val8, Leu89 and Leu53 on the outer surface of the b-sheet. Before determination of the structure, we had expected that these hydrophobic side-chains are covered with another part of the molecule, such as

the C-terminal segment, but the determined structure shows that these three residues are not covered but make a hydrophobic patch exposed to the solvent. The side-chains of other hydrophobic residues in the b-sheet, Val5, Leu7, Ile17, Leu52, Cys86 and Ile88, were located on the opposite side and constituted the hydrophobic core. In Sp. platensis ferredoxin, Lys and Thr occupy the positions of Leu89 and Leu53, respectively. Leu89 is observed only in the three thermostable ferredoxins. In the thermostable M. laminosus ferredoxin, this position is occupied by Glu, but Val is located at the position of Lys87 instead, which is, however, observed in several thermolabile ferredoxins. Whether these hydrophobic residues exposed to the solvent contribute to thermostability of the molecule is a highly interesting question to be elucidated. Otherwise, they might be involved in the interaction with other molecules, especially at the high physio-

logical temperature for Sy. elongatus, where hydrophobic interactions become stronger. Contribution of electrostatic interaction to thermostability Hase et al. (1983) suggested from comparison of the sequence of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin with that of Sp. platensis that there may be three new salt bridges in Sy. elongatus ferredoxin, that is, Arg9 ± Glu94, Lys72 ± Glu71 or C terminus and Arg83 ± Glu21 or Asp58. On the new basis of the tertiary structure of the thermostable ferredoxin, we investigated the possibilities of interaction between these pairs, although most side-chains on the molecular surface were not well de®ned. Figure 7(a) shows the basic amino acid residue Arg83 and its surrounding charged residues. The nearest neighbors are three acidic residues Glu21, Glu56 and Asp58. Both of the positions of Arg83 and Glu56 were frequently occupied by Thr in mesophile ferredoxins. The insertion of a positive charge in the center of the negative charge cluster should mostly cancel the repulsion. Therefore, the replacement of Thr with Arg at the position of residue 83 may contribute to the thermostability, and the change from Thr to Glu56 might reinforce this network of electrostatic interaction. We discovered another pair, Lys87 and Glu54 (Figure 7(a)), whose positions are occupied by Val/Thr and Ser, respectively, in most mesophile ferredoxins. There were no NOEs which limited the orientation of these side-chains, but they could get close to each

other and contribute to thermostability. The whole network of charges shown in Figure 7(a) is unique to Sy. elongatus and Sy. lividus. Figure 7(b) shows Lys72 and its neighboring acidic residues. The position of Lys72 is occupied by Ala in most thermolabile ferredoxins. The positive charge of Lys72 should cancel the dipole moment of the a-helix at residues 67 to 72 and stabilize the secondary structure. This lysine residue may interact also with the negatively charged C terminus. This might help the stabilization of the other short a-helix at residues 94 to 97 by interaction with its dipole moment. In addition, we found another pair, Lys51 and Glu95, also shown in Figure 7(b). There are different residues at the position of Glu95 in mesophile ferredoxins, and a glutamate residue is observed at the corresponding position of E. arvense ferredoxin, but it interacts with a lysine residue at position 92 instead. All these electrostatic interactions in Figure 7(b) appear to cooperate in ®xing the two short a-helices. Arg9 had been suggested to make a salt bridge with Glu94, but Figure 7(c) shows that Arg9 is oriented rather to the opposite direction, namely, to the molecular core. This residue seems to interact with Asp35 or Asp11, although the surrounding regions of these residues are not well re®ned. The side-chain hydrophobicity of Arg9 compared with that of Asn or Thr might contribute to thermostability and explain its appearance limited to thermostable ferredoxins.

Natural strategies of ferredoxins for thermostability Here, not only have we certi®ed the proximity of the two postulated electrostatically interacting pairs, but also we discovered unexpected pairs near those expected pairs, and they together form highly organized networks of charges. In addition, we found an extension of the hydrophobic core and a unique hydrophobic patch. We believe some or all of these interactions contribute to thermostability, although the actual determinants are to be elucidated using site-directed mutagenesis. These stabilization mechanisms are almost unique to thermostable ferredoxins, especially to Sy. elongatus and Sy. lividus, which are highly homologous to each other. Ferredoxins from other thermophiles, M. laminosus and C. caldarium, share only a

few features of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin, and they might adopt other strategies for thermostability. On the other hand, Anabaena 7120 heterocyst ferredoxin shares some features of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin, which is less stable than the ferredoxin from vegetative cells (Chae et al., 1994). Since this isoform was shown to be severely destabilized by a single residue substitution with His at the position of Arg41 of Sy. elongatus (Hurley et al., 1995), more experiments are needed to elucidate the role of the residues discussed above. Finally, we would like to emphasize the importance of the interaction between the segments Leu53 to Asp58 and Arg83 to Leu89. In Sy. elongatus ferredoxin, the interaction was reinforced by two sets of electrostatic interaction and one set of hydrophobic interaction. This fact might indicate that in mesophile ferredoxins these segments make

930 a weakpoint which is sensitive to unzipping, and studies on dynamics or denaturation kinetics in combination with site-directed metagenesis would be of interest. Comparison with another NMR structure of Sy. elongatus ferredoxin After preparation of the manuscript, a structure of the same ferredoxin in solution was published (Baumann et al., 1996). Signi®cant differences exist between the two structures. The RMSD value of the Ca coordinates from their Protein Data Bank entry 1ROE (model 1) with Ê those from our structure was 4.3 A (Figure 8(a)). The values with those of the ®ve other ferredoxins

Ê discussed above were 4.3 to 4.7 A. These values were quite abnormal for the homologous proteins with approximate 70% sequence homologies, and much larger than the RMSD values between our structure and those of other ferredoxins, 1.3 to Ê 1.9 A. Even in the case where the modeled residues 37 to 49, 63, 64 and 76 to 79 were excluded, the Ca RMSD value between the two structures of the Ê same molecule was 4.0 A. The main structural feature described in their paper was the salt bridge between the residues Lys51 and Glu56 inside the hydrophobic core, with a suggestion that it is related to the thermostability. However, in our structure, they protrude into the solvent (Figure 8(b)) similarly to the corresponding residues in other ferredoxin structures. There are

TOCSY spectra were recorded using DIPSI-2 as spin lock pulses (Cavanagh & Rance, 1992) with a mixing time of 45 ms. NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 75 ms and 200 ms. After zero ®lling once in the t2 dimension and twice in the t1 dimension, phase-shifted sine-bell functions or Gaussian functions were applied prior to Fourier transformation: 2048 Â 2048 real data matrices were ®nally obtained. Structure calculations Upper limits of NOE distance constraints were calculated as kIÀ1/6, where I is the peak intensity on the NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 75 ms. The constant k was determined so that the mean of the three strongest peak intensities that were assigned unambiguously to the sequential NOEs between CaH and NH corÊ responds to the distance of 2.2 A. All the distance Ê constraints were relaxed by 0.5 A considering mobility. È Calculations with X-PLOR version 3.1 (Brunger, 1993; Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) were achieved on a Silicon Graphics Power Indigo2 workstation. We used an iterative method for NOESY peak assignments and structure calculations (Hatanaka et al., 1994). We used the sa.inp alias YASAP (Nilges et al., 1988) whose high-temperature dynamics were extended into 30,000 steps. The iron-sulfur cluster was replaced with four hydrogen atoms during structure calculations. No hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential, or experimental torsion angle terms were present in the target function. The ®nal structure calculations were based on 1187 interproton distance constraints including 946 from NOEs and 241 from the crystal structure of Sp. platensis ferredoxin. 860 NOE constraints were assigned to single pairs of resonances (355 intra-, 199 sequential [ji À jj  1], 107 middle-range [2 < ji À jj < 5], and 199 long-range [ji À jj > 5] NOEs). In addition, 86 constraints were assigned to multiple pairs using X-PLOR ``or'' operators and dynamically assigned to each pair during structural calculations (Hatanaka et al., 1996). Analysis of the calculated structures For quantitative assessment of the convergence of the calculations, root-mean-square NOE violations, numbers of NOE violations, and the values of Frepel and FNOE were examined as described in our previous work (Hatanaka et al., 1994). A mean structure was obtained by averaging and minimizing the coordinates of the structures that were ®rst superimposed to the best converged structure for a minimum pairwise RMSD of the backbone atoms (N, Ca, C) for the residues 1 to 97.

three reasons why we cannot agree with their salt bridge. First, there are some NOE constraints between the side-chain of Lys51 and those of Phe74 and Gln92, which direct the Lys51 side-chain against the hydrophobic core. Second, although Figure 10 in their paper shows that the residues Lys51 and Leu89 face each other inside the antiparallel b-sheet, that is, they make two backbone hydrogen bonds, their actual coordinates (Figure 8(c)) show that the side-chains of these residues direct themselves oppositely, and that what they call b-sheet is destroyed perfectly. The next side-chains of Leu52 and Ile88 are also directed almost oppositely to each other. Third, the same Lys and Glu residues exist also in the Anabaena 7120 heterocyst ferredoxin, and the side-chain directions of these residues are perfectly the same as those in our structure (Jacobson et al., 1993). Why are these two structures so different? Out of our 946 NOE constraints, 67 constraints were violated in their structure (1ROE, model 1) by Ê Ê more than 2 A. The largest violation 8.52 A is loa g cated between Leu52 C H and Val75 C H. The 16 Ê violations greater than 5 A include multiple large violations between the residues Leu52 and Val75 and between Phe74 and Gln92, but there are no critical inconsistencies as to these residues between the two chemical shift assignment tables. This might suggest that most differences were caused from the process of NOESY assignment. During our semi-automatic NOESY assignment process (Hatanaka et al., 1994), ®xing the geometries of the 19 residues around the iron-sulfur cluster was helpful for solving the assignment degeneracies of NOESY peaks outside the modeled region. Since the biggest differences illustrated in Figure 8(b) and (c) is located close to the modeled region, the difference in the modeling procedure might have resulted in the signi®cant differences in these two structures.

Materials and Methods
NMR spectroscopy Ferredoxin was puri®ed from Sy. elongatus as previously described (Koike & Katoh, 1979). For NMR measurements, it was further puri®ed by chromatography with DEAE-Toyopearl columns or by gel ®ltration with Sephadex G-50 columns. The absorbance ratio A422/A275 was 0.65. Ferredoxin from Sy. elongatus was dissolved at 2.5 mM concentration in the H2O (10% 2H2O) buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM NaCl. The pH was 7.2 with an uncorrected glass electrode reading (pH*) by using a Radiometer PHM 84 and an Ingold thin-glass electrode. The NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL a-600 spectrometer operating at 1H frequency of 600 MHz. Chemical shifts were quoted relative to 2,2dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate used as an internal reference. DQF-COSY (Rance et al., 1983), TOCSY (Bax & Davis, 1985), and NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979; Macura et al., 1981) spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode (States et al., 1982). The water resonance was suppressed by means of the DANTE pulse (Zuiderweg et al.,
