Fluorescent chemosensors for the detection and measurement of metal ions, especially for cations with biological interest such as Na+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, are actively investigated.1 In particular, Cu2+ is the third in abundance among the essential heavy metal ions in the human body and plays an important role in various biological processes. Especially, copper is known to play a crucial role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and Wilson's disease. In this regard, copper binding studies in b-amyloid peptide,2 human- and bovine serum albumins4 as well as transferrin (Tf)3d,4 have been actively reported. The serum iron transport protein, Tf, which is known to bind Cu2+ and the Cu2+­ Tf complex characterized by a log K value of 12.3.4b Also, it is reported that the residues 135­155 of the cystein-rich domain of APP (amyloid precursor protein), a protein highly implicated in Alzheimer's disease, are participating as Cu2+ binding site.2a Accordingly, the design and synthesis of fluorescent chemosensors for copper ions have become a very active area of research.1d,5 Calcein especially has been widely used for the various metal ion binding studies including Cu2+.6 We report herein a new fluorescein derivative, which can effectively recognize Cu2+ in 100% aqueous solution.

Also, the Cu2+ ion uptake by transferrin and amyloid precursor protein was monitored using the title fluorescent chemosensor. A diethyl iminodiacetate fluorescein (2) was synthesized through a Mannich reaction between 2 0 ,7 0 -dichlorofluorescein and the iminium ion condensation of product of formaldehyde and diethyl iminodiacetate. The tetra acid 1 was produced in 92% yield by hydrolysis with potassium hydroxide in water (Scheme 1). The product was

fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high resolution FAB mass spectroscopy. The experimental details and characterization data are explained in the supplementary data. Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ ions were used to evaluate the metal ion binding properties of 1. All fluorescent studies were conducted at pH 7.4 (20 mM HEPES) and using a 1 lM concentration of compound. The fluorescence emission changes of 1 upon the addition of various metal ions (100 equiv) are illustrated in Figure 1. The fluorescence spectra were obtained by excitation into the fluorescein fluorophore at 505 nm, and both the excitation and emission slits were 1.5 nm. As shown in Figure 1, compound 1 displayed large chelation-enhanced quenching (CHEQ) effects with Cu2+ and Ni2+. A small red-shift (6 nm) with Hg2+ and a small blue-shift (7 nm) with Zn2+ were observed. Similar red-shift and blue-shift were also observed for Hg2+ and Zn2+ in their UV spectra (S-Fig. 4). From the fluorescence titration experiments, the dissociation constants of complex 1 with Cu2+ (Fig. 2) and Ni2+ (S-Fig. 5) were observed to be 26 nM and 700 nM, respectively (errors <10%).7 Figure 3 explains the titration curves of 1 with Cu2+ and Ni2+ using fluorescent changes. The selectivity for Cu2+ over

Ni2+ was more than 25 times. As shown in Figure 2, an overall emission change of 10-fold was observed for Cu2+. It is well documented1d that when Cu2+ binds tightly to the host compound, intracomplex quenching takes place (via energy or electron transfer8). To test the further selectivity of the fluoroionophore for Cu2+ binding, the fluorescence responses of compound 1 to other metal ions were measured and compared to that of Cu2+ ions. Figure 4 explains that emission intensities of 1 with 1 lM Cu2+ in the presence of 100 lM of Ca2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+ ions were almost the same as that using 1 lM Cu2+ alone (S-Fig. 6). Even in the presence of 1 mM of these metal ions, there was not a significant difference in the fluorescence intensities (S-Fig. 6). Furthermore, there was no significant change in the association constant for Cu2+ when excess Ca2+ (0.1 mM) was present (S-Fig. 7). The job plots using the fluorescence changes indicated 1:1 and 1:2 mixed binding for 1 with Cu2+ (S-Fig. 8). We next examined the feasibility of the biological applications of 1 by using Tf, a model protein for Cu2+ uptake.5a Figure 5 shows that the fluorescence intensity of 1 is correlated to the concentration of Tf. This tendency arose due to the regeneration of fluorescence of 1 by the Cu2+ uptake to Tf instead of 1, resulting

were added together to the mixture of Transferrin and chemosensor 1, chemosensor 1 was not fully quenched. This seemed to be caused by the competition between Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions for the metal binding sites of Transferrin. The number of the binding sites on Transferrin previously available for Cu2+ became less available for Cu2+ by the binding of Fe3+ to Transferrin. This explanation can be further supported by the fact that Transferrin can transport both Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions in the blood.9 In conclusion, we synthesized compound 1 as a fluorescent chemosensor for copper ions, which can be obtained via relatively simple two-step reactions in a moderate yield. It shows a high specificity for nanomolar copper ions at the physiological pH. Furthermore, the usefulness of the title fluorescent chemosensor 1 as a sensor molecule was demonstrated by monitoring Cu2+ ion uptake by copper binding proteins such as TF and APP135­155, respectively. This highly sensitive Cu2+-selective chemosensor can be suitable for many other biological applications possibly including in vivo experiments.

in a positive calibration curve. At 5 lM Tf, 1 fully regenerated the fluorescence quenched by Cu2+ ion to the level of intensity, equivalent to the intensity obtained in the absence of Cu2+. Similar experiments were performed with APP135­155 (copper-binding fragment of the human wild-type amyloid precursor protein) as shown in Figure 6. At 50 lM APP135­155, 1 fully regenerated the fluorescence quenched by Cu2+ ion to the level of intensity, equivalent to the intensity obtained in the absence of Cu2+. The Kd value of APP135­155 is reported as 10 lM,3a while the Cu2+­Tf complex is characterized by a log K value of 12.3.5b Our fluorescent changes upon the addition of Tf or APP135­155 are quite consistent with the known affinity of Tf and APP135­155. Fe3+ ion can interfere with the Cu2+-selective sensing behavior obtained with Transferrin. In our experiments, in which Cu2+ and Fe3+ ion at the same concentrations
