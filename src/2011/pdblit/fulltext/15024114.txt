Cytoplasmic face-mediated integrin inside-out activation remains a paradigm in transmembrane signal transduction. Emerging evidence suggests that this process involves dissociation of the complex between the integrin cytoplasmic tails; however, a dynamic image of how it occurs on the membrane surface remains elusive. We show here that, whereas membrane-proximal helices of integrin cytoplasmic tails associate in cytoplasm-like aqueous medium, they become partially embedded into membranemimetic micelles when unclasped. Membrane embedding induces substantial structural changes of the cytoplasmic tails as compared to their aqueous conformations and suggests there may be an upward movement of the membrane-proximal helices into the membrane during their separation. We further demonstrate that the 3 tail exhibits additional membrane binding site at its C terminus containing the NPLY motif. Talin, a key intracellular integrin activator, recognizes this site as well as the membraneproximal helix, thereby promoting cytoplasmic tail separation along the membrane surface. These data provide a structural basis of membrane-mediated changes at the cytoplasmic face in regulating integrin activation and signaling.
NMR micelles transmembrane signaling cell adhesion receptor

ntegrins are a major family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors and are essential for the development and survival of multicellular organisms (1, 2). They function by interacting with matrix proteins through their large extracellular domain and with intracellular proteins by means of their small cytoplasmic domain composed of the C-terminal 20­50 residues of each subunit. In this manner, integrins link the exterior and interior of the cell to regulate a variety of cellular processes including adhesion, spreading, and migration. Typical of other cell surface receptors, integrins can transduce signals from outside the cell into the cytoplasm on binding of extracellular ligands (outside-in signaling). Unique to integrins is their capacity to also transduce inside-out signaling; i.e., integrins are normally expressed on the cell surface in a low-affinity state, but signals received from other cell surface receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors, are transmitted from the integrin cytoplasmic face to the extracellular domain, thereby increasing the affinity avidity of the receptors for ligands (integrin activation) (2). The molecular mechanism by which the cytoplasmic face mediates such conformation-based inside-out signaling has been under intensive investigation over the past decade (3). These studies have led to a model where the and cytoplasmic tails associate to form a clasp in maintaining the receptor at a low-affinity state, whereas cellular activators such as talin induce the dissociation of the clasp during inside-out activation (4­7). This unclasping hypothesis is supported by NMR data (7), biochemical data (8, 9), and a most recent fluorescence energy transfer experiment in vivo (10). However, although the detailed structural basis of integrin cytoplasmic clasp in regulating integrin activation has been elucidated on integrin IIb 3 (7), the extension of the activation mechanism to other integrins and, more importantly, the structural events that occur subsequent to unclasping to sustain the active conformer remain largely unclear.

I

To determine whether the unclasping hypothesis is a general mechanism for integrin activation, we have performed NMR experiments on two representative integrins: 5 1, a member of the largest integrin subfamily (the 1 subfamily), and v 3, an integrin implicated in diverse biological responses including angiogenesis, apoptosis, and tumor growth (1, 2), both of which can be activated in a talin-dependent manner, as recently demonstrated by using small interference RNA technology (11). We show that the cytoplasmic tails of these integrins also associate in aqueous solution and dissociate on binding to talin, thus establishing that cytoplasmic unclasping is a general mechanism for initiating integrin inside-out activation. Furthermore, to gain a detailed molecular understanding of how cytoplasmic tail unclasping occurs at the membrane surface, we have characterized in detail the membraneanchoring and structural properties of integrin IIb 3 cytoplasmic tails in membrane-mimetic micelles. We show that, although membrane-proximal helices of IIb 3 tails associate in a cytoplasm-like aqueous medium, they become partially embedded into membrane in the unclasped state, thereby inducing substantial conformational change on each tail. This provides new structural insight into the integrin activation where the membrane-proximal helices may move upward into the membrane on separation. We further show that the 3 tail contains an unanticipated additional membraneanchoring site in the vicinity of a major docking site for several integrin-binding proteins, including talin. We demonstrate that talin binds to this site as well as to the membrane-proximal helix. These data allow us to extend the unclasping hypothesis to incorporate mechanisms for how talin facilitates cytoplasmic tail separation and movement along the membrane surface and how separation is sustained to maintain the activated state of the receptor. Methods cytoplasmic tails of IIb, v, 5, 1-N, and 3-N (C-terminal truncations of the 3 and 1 tails) were synthesized by the LRI Biotechnology Core (Cleveland; see Fig. 1A for sequences). Large quantities of full-length 3 tail and 3 tail mutants were synthesized by using the procedure described (12). All peptides were HPLC purified and their molecular weights were confirmed by MS. Recombinant and or isotope-labeled IIb tail, 3 tail, maltose-binding protein (MBP)- 1 tail, MBP- 3 tail, talin head domain (1­429), and talin F2-F3 (206­429) were all prepared by using described procedures (7).

To examine how talin-H perturbs the 5 1 tail interaction using the transferred NOE method, a solution of 1 mM unlabeled 5 tail was prepared in the presence of 0.1 mM MBP- 1 and 0.2 mM talin-H in 20 mM phosphate buffer 5 mM Ca2 , pH 6.3.

Results and Discussion We have previously used multiple NMR approaches to demonstrate the IIb 3 cytoplasmic tail interaction (7). To investigate whether such interaction occurs with 5 1 and v 3 tails, respectively (see sequences in Fig. 1 A), we first used the most sensitive transferred NOE method, where we examine the NOE pattern of an cytoplasmic tail in the presence and absence of partner fused to large MBP (7). Fig. 1B shows the 2D NOESY spectrum of the 5 tail in an aqueous medium in the presence of the 1 tail fused to MBP ( 5:MBP- 1 10:1). Substantial transferred NOEs (Fig. 1B) are clearly induced by 5 1 interaction as compared to the random-coiled NOESY pattern for free 5 tail (Fig. 1C). The transferred NOEs were also observed for the v MBP­ 3 tail complex (Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Note that the fusion protein MBP was previously shown not to be involved in the tail interaction because the MBP alone did not induce any transferred NOEs to IIb (7). To confirm the interaction between the tails, we performed another independent NMR study: the NOESY spectrum of a mixture of the 5 tail and a C-terminally truncated 1 tail ( 1-N) (no fusion attached to either 5 or 1-N) was compared to the NOESY spectrum obtained by mathematically adding the individual 5 and 1-N spectra together. This approach has been effectively used to detect IIb 3 tail interactions (17). Fig. 1D shows that the mathematical addition of individual 5 and 1-N NOESY spectra is significantly different from the NOESY of the 5 1-N mixture. The actual NOESY spectrum of the mixture exhibits substantially more NOEs (Fig. 1D), reflecting the 5 1­N tail interaction. Of note, the C-terminal tail is clearly not involved in the complex formation, consistent with the structure of the IIb 3 cytoplasmic complex where the complex interface is restricted to the highly conserved membraneproximal regions of the tails (7). The talin head domain, composed of a four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, and moesin domain containing three subdomains, F1, F2, and F3, or a smaller fragment of talin head domain, talin F2-F3, activates integrin IIb 3 by binding to the cytoplasmic tails (7, 18, 19). To investigate how talin acts on integrin 5 1 and v 3 tail complexes, we examined the transferred NOE effect by adding the talin head domain or talin F2-F3 to 5 MBP- 1 or v MBP- 3 mixtures. Fig. 1C demonstrates that either the talin head domain or talin F2-F3 completely quenches the transferred NOEs for 5 to its 1 tail partner. The same effect was observed with the v 3 cytoplasmic complex (Fig. 6) and the IIb 3 cytoplasmic complex (7). Hence, cytoplasmic clasping and talin-mediated unclasping occur with multiple integrins. Although the structure of the IIb 3 tail complex in aqueous solution provided insight into the resting cytoplasmic face of the receptor (7), the structure of the active cytoplasmic face in the unclasped state is unknown, which limits our understanding of integrin activation at a molecular level. With the above additional data indicating that the unclasped state occurs as an important step in the activation of multiple integrins, it becomes essential to determine the structure of the free and tails and their relationship to the membrane. To investigate this, we dissolved IIb and 3 tail peptides in DPC detergent micelles. DPC has the same zwitterionic phosphocholine head group as the dominant phospholipids of most eukaryotic membranes and has been used extensively as a membrane mimetic for NMR studies (20, 21). We have previously shown that the N-terminal myristoylated IIb tail can be incorporated into DPC micelles

and acquires structure as contrasted to the random coil that is observed in aqueous solution (12). Surprisingly, DPC induced substantial spectral changes for both nonmyristoylated IIb and 3 tails (Fig. 2), demonstrating that each of the tail peptides bound to DPC. Resonance assignments of IIb showed that only its membrane-proximal K989-R997 region is substantially perturbed on binding to DPC (Fig. 2 A), indicating that this region is involved in interacting with membrane. On the other hand, essentially all of the resonances in 3 are significantly perturbed on binding to DPC (Fig. 2B), suggesting that 3 underwent a more complex conformational rearrangement than IIb. To understand how exactly DPC binds to the peptides, we performed 15N 13C-filtered NOESY experiments on IIb and 3, each dissolved in protonated DPC. Detailed analyses showed that side chains of IIb K989-F993 (Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site) and 3 K716-I721 exhibit extensive NOE contacts with hydrophobic methylene groups of DPC (Fig. 3), indicating that these regions are fully inserted into the membrane. The insertion regions are consistent with those predicted previously by glycosylation analysis on the individual cytoplasmic peptides to map the boundaries of their membrane insertion (22) and contrast with the boundaries maintained when the cytoplasmic peptides are in complex representing the integrin in its nonactivated state (7). Surprisingly, the filtered NOESY experiments also revealed an additional DPC-binding site on the 3 tail at its NPLY region (Fig. 3). A 3 C-terminal peptide containing the NPLY region (with no membrane-proximal region) also binds to DPC, thus providing additional evidence for membrane anchoring involving the NPLY motif (Fig. 8, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). In comparison with the membrane-proximal regions, this region does not have extensive contacts with DPC (Fig. 3). The major contacts at this site appear to involve the side chains of T741 and Y747 (strong NOEs) (Fig. 3). These two side chains interact with each other in the 3 tail structure (see below) to stabilize the NPLY turn, indicating structurally how this region might orient and anchor onto the membrane surface. The membrane anchoring of the NPLY region has important functional implications: because the cytoplasmic tails are separated during integrin activation (7, 8, 10), the membrane anchoring of this region may restrict the movement of the 3 tail during tails separation. However, because this region overlaps with the talin-binding site (7,

23), talin binding could relieve this additional membrane-anchoring constraint, which then facilitates the movement of the 3 tail during tail separation. Consistently, although 3 D723R mutation would induce cytoplasmic unclasping for constitutive inside-out integrin activation (7), talin knock-down suppressed integrin activation (11), suggesting that the unclasping-induced lateral movement of 3 tail is restricted due to the membrane anchoring of the NPLY region. The membrane detachment of this region by talin may also allow it to bind to other proteins such as kinases for phosphorylation as well as to adaptors involved in outside-in signaling (24).
Table 1. Structural statistics for IIb and 3 tails

To gain more detailed structural insight into the membraneanchoring topology of cytoplasmic tails, we determined the NMR structures of IIb 3 tails in DPC (see Table 1 for structural statistics). As expected, IIb K899-N996 adopts a helical structure. However, in contrast to the ``closed inactive'' IIb structure obtained for the myristoylated form (12), which was also observed for this tail in the IIb 3 complex in aqueous solution (7), the C-terminal part of nonmyristoylated IIb tail does not fold back to interact with the membrane-proximal region (Fig. 4A). The DPC embedding of K989-F993 in the IIb tail clearly precludes interaction between F993 in the membrane proximal region and P1000 and the methylene group of D1004 in the C-terminal region, as observed previously (7, 12). It is very likely that the long and hydrophobic myristoyl group previously used to anchor the IIb tail onto the DPC allowed for little or only partial membrane embedding of IIb F993, which permitted its interaction with the C-terminal loop, thus forming the ``closed'' conformation (12) seen in the tail complex (7). The membrane-bound structure of the 3 tail is shown in Fig. 4B. The prominent features of this structure are a long membrane-proximal -helix (K716-R734) followed by a flexible loop and another short helix at Y747-T755. One interesting, but not so surprising, feature of the membrane-proximal helix in our structure is a kink at residue D723, which allows this helix to bend slightly and brings the flexible loop into possible contact with the membrane surface (see below). An irregular structural feature in the D723 region was also suggested in a secondary structural analysis of the 3 cytoplasmic-transmembrane domain performed by Li et al. (25). However, instead of the slightly bent structure that we determined, Li et al. (25) proposed a hinge that breaks the membrane proximal helix into two parts based on the J-coupling constant and some dynamics data. Another notable difference between our study and that of Li et al. (25) is that we precisely defined membrane-anchoring sites using filtered NOESY experiments. The connecting loop between the two helices in our structure is less defined and flexible, as indicated by the absence of medium and long-range NOEs. Immediately next to the loop is the N744PLY747 motif that forms an inverse

turn, which is the start point for the second helix. The turn is stabilized by long-range interaction between the T741 methyl group and the Y747 ring. The formation of the C-terminal helix is surprising, because it was absent in the structure of the IIb 3 tail complex in aqueous solution. Because no long-range NOEs were observed between the N- and C-terminal helices, the formation of the C-terminal helix is likely induced and stabilized by the docking of the NPLY turn onto DPC. The N756ITY759 motif after the helix exhibits a helical turn feature and is followed by the unstructured C terminus of the peptide. The structures of the IIb and 3 tails and their detailed intermolecular NOEs with DPC allowed us to construct a membrane-anchoring topology of the unclasped (active) cytoplasmic face (Fig. 5). For IIb, the membrane-proximal K989F993 insert into the membrane with the rest of the tail being below the membrane surface. Because of the insertion, the C-terminal acidic loop of IIb moves away, which otherwise interacts with the insertion region (7, 12). This results in an ``open'' conformation of the IIb tail, which we know to be an active form of the receptor because mutations that induce this open form activate IIb 3 (12). For 3, the N-terminal K716I721 is embedded into the membrane. The C-terminal part of 3 tail, which is otherwise anchored onto the membrane surface through the NPLY region in the inactive integrin, is detached from membrane surface by talin (Fig. 5). Thus, talin likely plays a dual role in integrin inside-out signaling: it detaches the NPLY region from the membrane, and it dissociates the membraneproximal clasp. Although crystallographic study has confirmed the direct interaction between talin F2-F3 and the NPLY motif (23), the exact talin-binding site in the membrane-proximal region is not unambiguously defined at this time, but two lines

Fig. 5. Structural illustration of integrin activation by talin. (A) A model for membrane-mediated change of cytoplasmic face during integrin activation. Agonist stimulation induces a conformational change in talin that exposes its head domain (Talin-H). Talin-H binds to the 3 tail at both the NPLY-containing region and the membrane-proximal helix. The binding to the membraneproximal region displaces the IIb tail from its complex with the 3 tail, leading to an unclasping, and the binding in the NPLY region releases a membraneanchoring constraint on 3, which further facilitates the unclasping movement along the membrane surface. Notice the shifted membrane interface for both membrane-proximal helices before and after unclasping (green bars), which suggests a ``fanning-out'' unclasping process because the transmembrane domains may also undergo separation or open-scissor motion. The unclasping initiates the opening of the integrin C-terminal stalks, which is necessary for the rearrangement of the extracellular headpiece for highaffinity ligand binding. (B) HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled 3 tail in the absence (black) and presence (red) of unlabeled talin F2-F3 at 35°C. Residues with significant chemical shift changes were labeled, which primarily involve membrane-proximal T720-D723 and C-terminal A735­A750, containing the N744-Y747 turn. (C) Surface plasmon resonance data. One hundred nanomol of talin-H (1­ 429) was passed over CM5 sensor chips coated with 3 (716 ­762) (red), a 3 membrane-proximal mutant (H722A D723A, black), or a 3 single mutant (F730A, green), with association and dissociation phases of 360 sec. The former mutant had diminished binding to talin, but the latter has about the same as the binding capacity to talin, indicating that H722D723 is critical for talin binding. D723A R724A mutations also had the same effect as H722A D723A (data not shown). Talin-H made no detectable interaction with IIb(989 ­1008) when this peptide was coupled to a CM5 chip.

of evidence suggest that it may contain H722-R724: (i) when titrated into 15N-labeled 3 tail, talin F2-F3 noticeably perturbs only the T720-D723 region and the middle segment containing the NPLY turn (Fig. 5B); and (ii) point mutations of H722D723 or D723R724 to AA substantially reduce talin binding to 3 (Fig. 5C), independently implicating HDR in binding to talin. Because D723 forms a salt bridge with IIb R995 (7), these data also indicate that talin disrupts the salt bridge and initiates cytoplasmic tail separation. The insertion of IIb 3 membrane-proximal regions in the dissociated state suggests an upward movement of these regions into the membrane during cytoplasmic tail separation (Fig. 5A). This process would result in more elongated transmembrane domains (Fig. 5A), which is supported by the previously proVinogradova et al.

posed C-terminal separation model (7, 8, 10) where transmembrane domains are expected to be more elongated from an inactive parallel coiled-coil state (26) to an active v-shaped (7, 8, 10) or open-scissor state (2, 6). Note that the proposed cytoplasmic location of the clasped membrane-proximal regions (Fig. 5A) is not merely based on the detection of the tail complex in the cytoplasm-like aqueous solution (7) but also is supported by the following observations: (i) Although the membraneproximal IIb K989-R997 interacts with the C-terminal part of the IIb tail in the IIb 3 tail complex in aqueous solution (7), partial membrane embedding of the former results in an ``open'' conformation by precluding such interaction (Fig. 4A). We know the open conformation represents the active form of IIb, because it was observed in the activating IIb P999A P1000A mutant (12). Thus, IIb adopts a ``closed inactive'' conformation in cytoplasm but an ``open active'' conformation when embedded into the membrane. (ii) A cryoelectron microscopy structure of inactive IIb 3 determined in a membrane-mimetic environment revealed that the IIb 3 tails are associated (26). This indicates that the membrane-proximal clasp is preserved in the intact receptor and is in the cytoplasm. The clasp would be disrupted if it were in the membrane due to the membrane embedding of the membrane-proximal interface; as shown by NMR, i.e., IIb 3 tail peptides weakly associate in aqueous solution but not in DPC (7). (iii) A number of integrin-activating proteins, such as talin (18), CIB (27, 28), and 3-endonexin (29), bind to the membrane-proximal regions of either IIb or 3, suggesting that these regions are in the cytoplasm for the low-affinity state of the integrin to be accessible to these intracellular activators. Conclusion The data presented allow us to propose how cytoplasmic unclasping occurs along the membrane inner surface during integrin activation and inside-out signaling (Fig. 5A). On agonist stimulation, a series of intracellular signaling events are initiated that propagate to the IIb 3 cytoplasmic face. One of these signaling events involves induction of a conformational change in an integrin activator. In the case of talin, the change exposes

its head domain such that it can bind to the 3 tail at both the NPLY-containing region and the membrane-proximal helix, as definitively shown here (Fig. 5 B and C) and suggested previously (7, 23, 30). The binding displaces the IIb tail from its complex with the 3 tail, leading to an upward movement of the membrane-proximal regions into the membrane. Such movement may occur as a ``fanning-out'' unclasping process, because the transmembrane domains may also undergo separation or open-scissor motion (Fig. 5A). The binding also releases the C-terminal membrane-anchoring constraint of 3, which further facilitates the unclasping movement along the membrane surface. The unclasping or reordering of the transmembrane segments initiates the opening up of the integrin C-terminal stalks in the extracellular domain, which is necessary for the structural rearrangement of the integrin headpiece for high-affinity ligand binding (31). This model of unclasping and upward movement is consistent with the recent fluorescence energy transfer data of Kim et al. (10), suggesting the occurrence of marked separation of the tails on integrin activation in intact cells. It is also consistent with the data of Tadokoro et al. (11), indicating a prominent role of talin in the activation of integrins. Such C-terminal opening may also facilitate integrin clustering and further enhanced ligand affinity through oligomerization of the transmembrane domains, as suggested by Li et al. (32). On the other hand, it is known that ligand binding induces additional conformational change (1, 2), which is transmitted to the cytoplasmic face (outside-in signaling). Although it remains to be determined how this conformational change occurs, one possibility is that ligand binding induces a piston motion that moves the membrane-embedded regions partially or fully back out of the membrane. There are several elegant examples for such ligand-induced piston motion (33, 34). A number of proteins such as calreticulin, FAK, and Rac1 (35) have been suggested to bind to these regions in ligated integrins, and the accessibility of their binding sites would be restricted to the ligated integrin by this mechanism, thus mediating outside-in signaling.
