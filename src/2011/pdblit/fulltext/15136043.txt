The tricorn interacting factor F3 is an 89 kDa zinc aminopeptidase from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum. Together with the tricorn interacting factors F1 and F2, F3 degrades the tricorn protease products and thus completes the proteasomal degradation pathway by generating free amino acids. Here, we present the crystal structures of F3 in three different ° conformations at 2.3 A resolution. The zinc aminopeptidase is composed of four domains: an N-terminal saddle-like b-structure domain; a thermolysin-like catalytic domain; a small barrel-like b-structure domain; and an a-helical C-terminal domain, the latter forming a deep cavity at the active site. Three crystal forms provide snapshots of the molecular dynamics of F3 where the C-terminal domain can adapt to form an open, an intermediate and a nearly closed cavity, respectively. With the conserved Zn2C-binding motifs HEXXH and NEXFA as well as the N-terminal substrate-anchoring glutamate residues, F3 together with the leukotriene A4 hydrolase, represents a novel gluzincin subfamily of aminoproteases. We discuss the functional implications of these structures with respect to the underlying catalytic mechanism, substrate recognition and processing, and possible component interactions.

Introduction
Protein degradation is one of the major tasks of cells in all living organisms. Each living cell needs to continuously clear vain or defective components to maintain the balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways and to make free amino acids available for the continuously rebuilding of cellular structures. Initial intracellular protein degradation is carried out mostly by unspecific proteases employing sieving mechanisms for substrate selection. Proteasomes are representatives of this class of proteases, which form cage-like structures to exclude folded substrates from their central cavities harboring the active sites. Products of proteasomes are peptides showing a broad size distribution with a peak length of 6­12 amino acid residues. For reuse

in protein synthesis or energy production, these peptides have to be further degraded into free amino acids. In the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum, this further degradation of the proteasomal products is carried out by the tricorn protease, which acts downstream of the proteasome in a processive manner to preferentially yield diand tripeptides.1,2 The subsequent final step of the protein degradation to free amino acids in the mentioned archaeon is performed by the tricorn interacting factors F1, F2 and F3 working downstream of the tricorn protease. While the tricorn interacting factor F1 is an aminopeptidase, which belongs to the a/b hydrolase super family,3­5 the tricorn interacting factors F2 and F3, which are not related to F1, are 89 kDa zinc-aminopeptidases sharing 56% sequence identity. The substrate specificity spectrum of F1 includes most hydrophobic residues such as alanine, proline, phenylalanine and leucine, but also glycine and tyrosine as P1 residues. F2 shows a broad specificity against neutral, hydrophobic and basic residues in the P1

789 by domain III (residue 415­489) and the first three helices of the C-terminal domain IV (residues ° 490­780), with a width of 40 A. The right lobe of ° the hook-shape has a length of 45 A and is, therefore, significantly shorter than the left lobe of the structure. It is composed of the remaining helices of the C-terminal domain IV. The relative ° arrangement of the four domains creates a 25 A deep cleft, which harbors the active site with the conserved zinc-binding motif. The active site is positioned on the left lobe of the hook-shaped structure. The cleft is broadening in a wedge-like ° ° fashion from 13 A at the entrance to 22 A at the ground of the cleft. The shape of the cleft varies within the different crystal forms and represents more open and more closed conformations of F3. The N-terminal domain I The N-terminal domain of F3 (residues 1­170) superimposes on the N-terminal domain of the human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) (residues 1­207) (PDB accession code 1HS6) with an r.m.s.d. ° value of 1.19 A for 145 Ca positions out of 170 and 207 residues for F3 and 207 residues for LTA4H. The domain is composed of three b-sheets. The central eight-stranded b-sheet is of mixed polarity. It forms a large, saddle-like surface and is largely solventexposed. An antiparallel three-stranded b-sheet and another antiparallel four-stranded b-sheet complete the saddle-like structure as a barrel-like domain. The organization of secondary structure elements of F3 and LTA4H is very similar. Remarkable insertions in LTA4H are localized to three loop structures. In LTA4H these are the 80-loop, the 124-loop and 182-loop corresponding to the 57-loop, the 92-loop and the 146-loop in F3. The four residue elongation of the 182-loop in LTA4H, which forms the right edge of the saddle-like structure, leads to stronger bending of the concave surface compared with F3, in which the corresponding 146-loop consists of only three residues. The 80-loop in LTA4H, which corresponds to the 57-loop in F3, narrows the active-site cleft of the hydrolase from the left side much more than the short, three residue 57-loop in F3 does (see Figure 2(b)). The abovementioned 124-loop (residues 120­128) in LTA4H is a surface loop composed mainly of the polar residues Gln122, Thr123, Ser124, Gly125 and Lys126. In F3 the corresponding 92-loop (residues 90­94) is four residues shorter. This solventexposed, mainly polar loop forms, together with the 82-loop (residues 80­84), a roof-like structure

position. F3 displays a much narrower range of substrate specificity compared to F2, with strong preference for glutamate in the P1 position.1 The closest related protein with known 3D structure is the human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (PDB accession code 1HS6),6 which shares 25% of identical amino acid residues with F3. Here, we present the crystal structure of the tricorn interacting factor F3 of T. acidophilum in the free form and in three different conformations, depending on the crystal form in which they were crystallized, giving insights into the molecular dynamics of F3 relating to substrate binding and mechanistic aspects of substrate processing. Moreover, the structure adumbrates how F3 might assemble with the tricorn protease and how the substrate transfer from the tricorn protease to F3 might proceed.

Results
BLAST homology search With respect to sequence similarity, a BLAST homology search displayed that the highest level of identity is with the aminopeptidase N from Thermoplasma volcanium (68%), followed by F2 (56%), the aminopeptidases Aap1p (37%) and Aap2p (36%) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and with the puromycin-sensitive amino peptidase (32%) from Homo sapiens (see Figure 1). All of these aligned aminopeptidases share the conserved HEXXH zinc-binding motif, which characterizes them as zinc peptidases. The third zinc-binding ligand is also conserved in the sequence motif NEXFA among the aligned sequences at a conserved distance of 18 amino acid residues from the second histidine residue of the zinc-binding motif. This relation makes it possible to subgroup the aligned aminopeptidases in the gluzincin family of metalloproteases.7 Overall structure of F3 F3 is composed of four domains which together form a hook-like structure (see Figure 2(a)). The ° overall dimensions of the structure are 80 A! ° !47 A. The left lobe is built by the N-terminal ° 40 A domain I (residues 1­170) and the catalytic domain ° II (residues 171­414), with a length of 80 A. The connecting turn of the hook-shaped structure is formed by the fifth helix of the catalytic domain II,

791 (see Figure 2(b) and (c)). The arrangement of the secondary structure elements of F3 and LTA4H is very similar. Superimposed thermolysin displays significant differences at the beginning and at the end of the catalytic domain. In thermolysin, the mixed a/b-structure is extended by four additional b-strands, which together with the conserved second five-stranded mixed b-sheet, form a rooflike structure (see Figure 2(c)). In F3 and in LTA4H, this roof-like structure is substituted by the saddlelike structure of the N-terminal domain I, which is absent from thermolysin. Moreover, the twostranded parallel b-sheet, which is positioned in the neighborhood of the active site in F3 and LTA4H, is substituted by a loop structure in thermolysin. The helices H5 and H6 in F3 are replaced in thermolysin by a long loop structure (residues 181­221) with three short helices inserted covering the front of the molecule. This long loop in thermolysin passes over to the loop corresponding to the long and highly flexible 338-loop in F3. In thermolysin, this loop is much shorter compared to F3 and LTA4H. Another special feature of thermolysin is the b-hairpin between the helices H7 and H8, which is absent from F3 and LTA4H (see Figure 2(c)). The architecture of the active site is very similar in all three structures. Significantly, the relative arrangement of the active site helices H3 and H4 and the position of the zinc coordinating residues are identical in all three zinc proteases (see Figure 3(a)). Domain III Domain III (residue 415­489) is a unique structural feature of F3. This domain is composed of the eight b-strands S23­S30. They are organized in a b-sandwich, from which b-strand S25 is excluded and pointing perpendicular to the other b-strands. This domain forms part of the bottom of the hookshaped overall structure. The C-terminal domain IV The C-terminal domain of F3 (residues 490­780) is a predominantly a-helical domain formed by 15 a-helices (H11­H25) that are organized into a superhelix. A similar superhelical arrangement of helices is observed in human b-catenin.9 In contrast to b-catenin, the superhelix of the C-terminal domain IV in F3 is bent so that two helical modules

narrowing the entrance of the cleft from the left side (Figure 2). The N termini of both proteins differ markedly from each other. The N terminus of LTA4H carries a 15 residue insertion, forming an additional loop structure. It is completely solvent-exposed with no contact to the rest of the protein and is therefore highly flexible (see Figure 2(b)). By contrast, the side-chain of the N-terminal Met1 in F3 points towards a hydrophobic surface depression composed of the hydrophobic side-chains of Ala27, Ala29, Gly30, Ile32, Val33, Ile25 and Ile102, which form the edges and the bottom of the hydrophobic depression, respectively. The Met1 side-chain is stabilized in this position by hydrophobic interactions with the side-chains of the above-mentioned residues. The catalytic domain II The first part of the catalytic domain of F3 is a mixed a/b-structure, which is composed of five b-strands. The three central b-strands are parallel, whereas the edge strands point in the opposite direction. The mixed b-sheet structure is interrupted between the b-strands S17 and S18 by helix H1. The b-strand S19 covers directly the active site and could therefore play a role in substrate recognition. The second part of this domain is built mainly by eight a-helices interrupted by a two-stranded (S21 and S22) parallel b-sheet. The conserved zinc-binding motif 265HEXXH269 is part of helix H3, whereby Glu266 serves as the general base for catalysis. The second conserved zincbinding motif NE288XFA, which contains the third chelating residue Glu288, is located in helix H4. Helices H5­H10 of this domain are interlocked in two planes forming a compact, densely packed a-helical structure. A remarkably long loop structure in F3 (residues 328­349) connects the helices H6 and H7. This 338-loop is highly flexible and covers the front of the active site. Superimposition of the catalytic domains of Thermoplasma acidophilus F3 with the human LTA4H and with Bacillus thermoproteolyticus thermolysin,8 a prominent representative of the gluzincin family of zinc proteases, highlights the structural homology of F3 with the human LTA4H and, to a lesser extent, with thermolysin (see Figure 2(c)). The catalytic domains of the three proteins deviate by an r.m.s.d. value of ° ° 1.65 A for LTA4H-F3 and 2.3 A for thermolysin-F3

are produced. The two helical modules are rotated by approximately 908 relative to each other. In both modules, the helices are organized into two layers of parallel helices, four helices in the inner layer and three helices in the outer layer of the first module, and four helices in both layers of the second module, which are arranged in an antiparallel manner. The inner helices of the first module complete the bottom, whereas the inner helices of the second module form the right side of the deep cleft. The outer layers of both modules create the bottom and the right lobe of the hook-shaped structure. Compared with all other domains of F3, the C-terminal domain is the domain with the greatest flexibility, as evident by high B-factors, especially those for the helices of the second module. The crystallization conditions (see Materials and Methods) yielded two different crystal forms. The first crystal form belongs to the trigonal space group P3221, with one molecule (MOL3) in the asymmetric unit, whereas the second crystal form belongs to the orthorhombic space group P21212, with two molecules (MOL1 and MOL2) in the asymmetric

unit (see Figure 4). Superimposition of the three different conformations MOL1, MOL2 and MOL3 demonstrates that the N-terminal domain, the catalytic domain and domain III are almost invariant in the different conformations. Similarly, the first helical module of domain IV remains largely unchanged in the three different conformations. Remarkable differences between MOL1 and MOL2 of the orthorhombic space group and MOL3 are found in the helices of the second block of domain IV. The superimposed backbones of the three different conformations show that MOL1 of the orthorhombic space group displays the widest cleft, ° in which the helices are translated up to 15 A to the ° right side and up to 5 A in the direction of the bottom. While the backbones of the four C-terminal helices of MOL2 in the orthorhombic space group and MOL3 in the trigonal space group appear to be very similar, there are marked differences in the first four helices of the second block, in which the chain trace of MOL3 resembles more that of MOL1 but is not shifted as far as in MOL1 in the direction of the bottom. These conformational changes seen in the different molecular structures of F3 are the

structural basis of open and closed active-site states. In this respect, the two crystallographically independent structures of the orthorhombic space group form the extremes, whereas the structure found in the trigonal space group represents an intermediate between the closed and the open conformation. Moreover, this superimposition shows that the relative arrangement of the helices in the second block of this domain is highly flexible. The three different observed conformations of F3 are caused by varying crystal contacts in the molecular packing of the orthorhombic and the trigonal space group. The open and the closed conformations of F3 provide snapshots of the molecular dynamics of F3 localized in the C-terminal segment and may serve as a model for the structural changes during substrate binding and processing. Superimposition of the C-terminal domains of F3 and LTA4H reveals that in LTA4H this domain is reduced to the first block of helices (see Figure 2(b)). While the second block of helices forms the hookshaped structure with the deep cleft in F3, the two layers of parallel helices are shifted in LTA4H, thereby occupying the location of the deep cleft in F3. Furthermore, in LTA4H this domain is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the N-terminal domain and the catalytic domain. Consequently, this domain is much less flexible in LTA4H than in F3, in which the distances to the N-terminal and the catalytic domains, especially of the second block of helices, are too wide for hydrogen bonding. The active site As mentioned above, the active site is positioned at the left lobe of the hook-shaped structure. The active site of F3 runs diagonally from the north-east

upper to the south-west side of the catalytic domain ° II (see Figure 5(a)). It is composed of a 20 A long ° ° groove that opens from 5 A at the west side to 15 A at the east side and merges directly into the deep cleft spread between the catalytic domain II and the C-terminal domain IV. Secondary structure elements of the N-terminal domain, the catalytic domain II and the C-terminal domain IV contribute to the active-site architecture. Whereas the secondary structure elements of the catalytic domain contribute most to the active site, the N-terminal domain adds two loops and the C-terminal domain only the Arg721 side-chain of helix H23 to the active-site architecture. The west of the active site is ° narrowing to a channel with 5 A diameter, which is solvent-connected and has space for one free amino acid. At the east of the active site, the side-chain of Arg316 separates the long groove into two smaller pockets, generating positive charge at the separation point of both pockets. The Arg316 side-chain is stabilized in this position with its guanidino group by hydrogen bonding to the hydroxyl group of theTyr296 side-chain, which belongs to the terminal part of the second active-site helix, H4. The first pocket points directly to the east, whereas the second one extends to the south of the active site. Both pockets are connected directly to the deep cleft. The roof of the east pocket is composed of the beginning of the first active-site helix, H3, with the side-chains of Thr254 and Asn258. It is closed to the east side by the aromatic rings of Trp306 and Phe308, while the bottom is formed by the sidechains of Arg316 and Asn311. The whole pocket is polar because of the two Asn side-chains and the Thr side-chain. The south pocket is made by the side-chain of Arg316 at the east side, the side-chain of Tyr351 at the west side and by the backbone of Tyr351 and Gly352 at the south side, and exhibits a

hydrophobic character. The two pockets suggest two different substrate binding modes corresponding to the binding of di- or tripeptides, which are both processed by F3. The conserved zinc-binding motif HEXXH is positioned at helix H3, whereas the third zincbinding ligand is positioned at helix H4. Both helices are slightly rotated against each other and connected with b-strand S21, which together with b-strand S22 forms a parallel, two-stranded b-sheet. The catalytic zinc ion is coordinated by the N32 atoms of His265 and His269, and by the carboxylate oxygen atom of Glu288. Together with one solvent molecule in the free, unbound state, the zinccoordinating atoms form an almost perfectly tetrahedral coordination sphere with the zinc ion in the center (see Figures 3(a) and 5(b)). The active-side solvent molecule is stabilized by the carboxylate group of Glu266, possibly playing the role of a

general base, as observed in other HEXXH metalloproteases (see below).7 O32 of Glu288 together with the carboxylate groups of Glu233 and Glu101 forms a negatively charged depression, which is perfectly shaped to accept the N-terminal ammonium group of the cleaved substrate. In the free, unbound state this position is occupied by a second solvent molecule. The carboxylate groups of Glu101, Glu233 and Glu288 are linked to this solvent molecule by hydrogen bonding. The roof of the active site is composed in the east of helix H3 as described above, in the west by the 86-loop (residues 80­93) with the side-chains of Leu83 and Ser84 and by the 102-loop (residues 89­109) with the side-chains of His99 and Glu101, which both belong to the N-terminal domain. His99 is the only residue in the 102-loop within a short distance to the zinc ion, which carries a positive charge and which could therefore serve as

Crystal Structure of T. acidophilum Factor F3

795 helices in the C-terminal domain of F3 is observed also in LTA4H. However, the relative position of this domain differs markedly in both proteins. The C-terminal domain of F3 is extended to a second layer of helices rotated approximately 908 to the first one forming the deep cleft in front of the active site. In LTA4H, this domain occupies the place of the cavity in F3 and influences directly the architecture of the active-site cleft, so that it is much narrower compared to F3. As the zinc-binding ligands are conserved over all members of this family by the motifs HEXXH and NEXFA, this family can be subgrouped in the gluzincin-family.7 All members shown in the alignment share aminopeptidase functionality and can be grouped into a new subfamily. Consequently, we declare this new subfamily as the aminopeptidase-family of gluzincins. One characteristic of this new subfamily is their third zinc-binding ligand in the motif NEXFA at a conserved distance of 18 amino acid residues from the second zinc-binding ligand, histidine. Another characteristic is their anchor site for the N terminus of the substrate, which is formed by the carboxylate groups of two glutamate residues. The anchoring glutamate residues correspond to Glu101 and Glu233 in F3. Together with the glutamate residue of the second zinc-binding motif, these anchoring residues form a negatively charged depression perfectly shaped for accepting the N terminus of substrates. LTA4H deviates at the Glu101 position, where it carries a glutamine residue. The Gln/Glu substitution in LTA4H is consistent with its special function in the leukotriene cascade as catalyst of the hydrolization of the leukotriene A4 epoxide. The stabilization of the N terminus in F3 in a hydrophobic depression as described above prevents autolysis. This is observed also in the prolyliminopeptidase F1,3 where the N terminus is stabilized by the cytosolic disulfide-bridge Cys5­Cys22. The different trace of the N terminus in LTA4H as described above is explained directly by its function as catalyst in the leukotriene A4 cascade, where autolysis protection in contrast to F1 and F3 is not necessary. Superimposition of the mechanistically relevant residues of F3, LTA4H6 and thermolysin8 of Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, the prototype of all gluzincins,8 as shown in Figure 3, confirms that the positions of the zinc-binding ligands are nearly identical in the three zinc proteases. It is therefore possible to transfer its proteolytic mechanism onto the aminopeptidases F3 and LTA4H. We propose the following proteolytic mechanism for F3 of T. acidophilum on the basis of the mechanism of aminopeptidase N,11 as well as that of thermolysin.8 The N terminus of the substrate is bound by the carboxylate groups of Glu101 and Glu233. Glu266 serves as a general base polarizing, together with the zinc ion, the zinc-bound water molecule.12 The substrate is bound with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the scissile bond to the zinc ion polarized in the same way as the active-site

interaction partner of a carboxyl oxygen atom of a substrate with glutamate in the P1 position. The middle of the roof is formed by the b-sheet S19 with Gly228, Gly230, the side-chain of Ala229 and by helix H2 with the side-chains of Arg241, Ile243 and Tyr244. The front wall of the active site is limited by helix H5 (residues 307­312) at the east side and the side-chains of Ile342, Phe346 and the backbone of Asp347 and Glu348, which all belong to the above-mentioned highly flexible 338-loop, at the west side. Moreover, the only residue of the C-terminal domain that is involved in the active-site architecture, is Arg721 of helix H23, whose sidechain points directly to the 338-loop stabilizing this loop conformation by hydrophobic interactions. The position of the Arg721 side-chain differs markedly in the three distinct conformations (see Figure 4). In all three conformations, the side-chain of Arg721 is poorly defined in the electron density map, reflecting its high degree of flexibility, but the backbones of helix H23 of MOL2 in the orthorhombic space group and of MOL3 in the trigonal space group are positioned so that the side-chain of Arg721 is within distance to make a hydrophobic interaction with the 338-loop.10 The 338-loop constitutes a small hydrophobic depression composed of the side-chains of Ile342, Ile345 and Phe346. The side-chain of Arg721 points directly towards this depression. In MOL1 ° (space group P21212) helix H23 is shifted 6.14 A to the front of the molecule, so that Arg721 has no contact to residues of the catalytic domain II. MOL1 is therefore considered as the open conformation. The backbones of MOL2 (P21212) and MOL3 (P3221) superimpose to a high degree in this region of the protein, but the closest conformation is displayed by MOL2, which is therefore defined as the closed conformation. Arg721 serves as the bridge residue between the catalytic domain II and the C-terminal domain IV, closing the gap between both domains and creating a closed deep cavity in front of the active site.

Discussion
The tricorn interacting factor F3 of T. acidophilum is a zinc aminopeptidase composed of four domains, three of which are shared with the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). Superimposition of the single domains of F3 and LTA4H demonstrates a high degree of similarity in the arrangement of the secondary structure elements of both proteins. Especially the organization of b-sheets in the N-terminal domain forming the saddle-like structure that covers the active site appears as a unique feature of this new group of zinc aminopeptidases. The thermolysin-like catalytic domain and the arrangement of the active-site helices, including the zinc-binding residues, are very similar in these proteins. Whereas the barrellike b-sheet structure of domain III is a unique feature of F3, the superhelical arrangement of the

796 water molecule. The active-site water molecule transfers one proton to the zinc-bound carbonyl oxygen atom and, by a nucleophilic attack on the scissile bond, forms the tetrahedral intermediate. In this reaction intermediate, the zinc ion is pentacoordinated by the three zinc-binding residues, the carbonyl group of the scissile bond and the active-site water molecule. The second proton of the active-site water molecule is transferred to the newly formed N terminus. Glu266 serves here as a proton shuttle, transferring the abstracted proton to the new N terminus. Moreover, Glu266 can stabilize the new positively charged N terminus by forming a salt-bridge. The P1 amino acid residue is bound by its C-terminal carboxylate group to the zinc ion. Both the carboxylate group of the amino acid and the N terminus of the cleaved substrate are set free by substitution of a new active-site water molecule, thus entering another proteolytic cycle. The tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized in thermolysin by the side-chains of Tyr157 and His231. The hydroxyl group of Tyr157 and the imidazole nitrogen atom of His231 function as proton donor, 8,13,14 by making their protons available to the tetrahedral intermediate. The superimposition of the three zinc proteases shows that Tyr351 (F3) and Tyr383 (LTA4H)6,15 are positioned, similar to His231 (thermolysin), at the first part of helix H7 to fulfil the proton donor function. Differences in the three zinc proteases are found in the position of the second proton donor residue. In thermolysin, Tyr157 is positioned in the loop structure between the two active-site helices. This loop is extended in thermolysin compared to F3 and LTA4H, because of the missing antiparallel b-sheet as described above. The extended loop structure in ° thermolysin is shifted 4.4 A towards the zinc ion so that the Tyr157 hydroxyl group is positioned perfectly to act as proton donor. In F3 and LTA4H, this position is occupied by a tryptophan residue. By the chemical nature of tryptophan, Trp281 (F3) and Trp311 (LTA4H) would be candidates to act as proton donor, similar to His231 in thermolysin. Since the above-mentioned loops in F3 and LTA4H are shorter, the distances between the zinc ion and the nitrogen of these tryptophan residues are too long for proton donor functionality. Instead, the side-chain of Tyr378 is positioned perfectly to fulfil this function in LTA4H. The alignment suggests that in all other aminopeptidases the Tyr378 position of LTA4H is occupied by a hydrophobic phenylalanine residue and consequently, one proton donor is missing. In F3, Phe346 is found at this position, which is conserved in all members of this family except in LTA4H. It is tempting, therefore, to speculate whether a point mutation F346Y would increase the protease activity of F3, as this substitution would provide the second proton donor besides Tyr351 and thus stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate. The function of the Tyr378 hydroxyl group in LTA4H can probably be fulfilled in F3 by Thr292, which is harbored by the second active-site

Crystal Structure of T. acidophilum Factor F3

helix, H4. The alignment shows that this threonine residue is conserved among all members of this family, except in the human puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (serine) and in LTA4H (valine). Further mutational studies have to be made to answer the question of whether the Thr292 hydroxyl group plays a role in the proteolytic mechanism of F3 and the related aminopeptidases. From the positions of the mechanistically relevant residues, one can draw conclusions on the evolutionary relationship of the three above-mentioned zinc proteases. The zinc-binding ligands including the general base in the first zinc-binding motif (HEXXH) are positioned nearly identically in F3, LTA4H and thermolysin, reflecting their co-evolution. Intriguingly, the residues fulfilling the proton donor function and their secondary structure elements differ in the three zinc proteases. While all three zinc proteases use the same general proteolytic mechanism, different residues have adapted for the proton donor function. This observation implies that the three zinc proteases represent an example of convergent evolution, which is driven by the same fundamental proteolytic mechanism. The hydrophobic and aromatic substitutions specific to LTA4H confer substrate specificity consistent with its function in the leukotriene cascade, as mentioned above. The comparison of the side-chains of Tyr383 in LTA4H and Tyr351 in F3 indicates that the Tyr351 side-chain is rotated away from the zinc ion. Moreover, in F3 the whole helix ° harboring Tyr351 is shifted around 2.7 A away from the zinc ion to the south of the active site. Both the rotated side-chain of Tyr351 and the shifted helix in F3 suggest that our F3 crystal structures represent inactive conformations of F3. We propose that the active conformation is induced by substrate binding and will be accompanied by a rotation of the Tyr351 side-chain towards the zinc ion. This will bring ° its hydroxyl group within a distance of 3.7 A to the zinc ion, so that it can function as proton donor. The two conformations of Tyr351 are shown in Figure 5 and labeled as active and inactive. Figure 5 depicts a model of bestatin, a natural unspecific inhibitor of zinc proteases, bound to the active site of F3, which is based on the complex of bestatin found with LTA4H.6 The phenyl ring of bestatin stacks between the side-chains of Glu101 and Ala229. Compared with LTA4H, in which the Ala229 position is replaced by Tyr267, the S1 pocket of F3 gives more space for the P1 residue. However, the aromatic ring of Tyr267 in LTA4H seems to be a preferred interaction partner for the phenyl ring of bestatin. Specificity in the F3 S1 pocket is generated only by His99, which is able to bind the preferred acidic residues in the P1 position. Modeling studies indicate that by substituting the phenyl ring of bestatin with a glutamate side-chain (data not shown), the carboxylate group of the glutamate would be positioned perfectly to interact with N31 of His99. Therefore, we denote this loop as the specificity loop of F3. Interestingly, in all other

Crystal Structure of T. acidophilum Factor F3

aligned aminopeptidases the His99 position of F3 is occupied by glutamine. In the case of the homologue F2 from T. acidophilum, the His/Gln substitution in F2 explains its broader specificity against neutral, hydrophobic and basic amino acids, whereas the substrate spectrum of F3 is much narrower, and is limited to acidic amino acids.1 The N terminus of bestatin is bound to the carboxylate groups of Glu233 and Glu101 in F3 as observed for LTA4H. The hydroxyl group and the neighboring carbonyl group of bestatin mimic the tetrahedral intermediate adopting, together with the zincbinding residues, the same pentacoordination of the zinc ion as expected for substrates during catalysis. The C terminus of bestatin is hydrogen bonded to the backbone nitrogen atom of Ala229 and Gly230. Also, this interaction motif is conserved in LTA4H. We predict Glu266 to serve as the general base and, consequently, to be essential for the proteolytic mechanism in F3. Glu266 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone nitrogen atom of bestatin and can, therefore, function as a transfer shuttle for the abstracted proton of the active-site solvent and as salt-bridging partner for the new positively charged N terminus of the cleaved substrate. The LTA4H-derived bestatin­F3 complex serves as an excellent model for substrate binding in the active site of F3, which is consistent with our proposed proteolytic mechanism of F3. The three conformational snapshots of F3 give us a deeper view into the molecular dynamics of F3. As shown in Figure 4, the only highly flexible part in F3 is the C-terminal domain IV. The N-terminal domain I, the catalytic domain II and domain III are largely rigid and, therefore, covered by the solid surface. In the helical C-terminal domain of F3, the relative arrangement of the helices is quite flexible; especially, the arrangement of the helices of the second block exhibits strong differences in the three different snapshots, which influences directly the size of the deep cleft in front of the active site. The three conformations, which we define as the open conformation (MOL1, P21212), the intermediate conformation (MOL3, P3221) and the closed conformation (MOL1, P21212), show nicely how a substrate would access the active site of F3 and how the product, the free amino acid, would egress the active-site cleft. In the open conformation of MOL1, the substrate could enter the cavity either from the top or from the front of the molecule. In the intermediate conformation of MOL3, the bottom of the molecule is closed and the top opening is narrowed, preventing the access of another substrate as well as avoiding unproductive release of the bound substrate. Only the middle part of the cavity remains open in the intermediate conformation. This could probably support the egress of substrates with mismatched P1 residues. In the closed conformation, no substrate could enter the cavity, and only the product, the free amino acid, could be released through the groove positioned at the bottom of the molecule. There are several lines of evidence of a

One subunit is covered with a semi-transparent surface. The b6 propeller is shown in this subunit as a yellow ribbon representation. The tricorn interacting factor F3 is shown as a solid surface in the open conformation of MOL1 (P21212). The Figure was prepared with GRASP32 and PYMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge. net/).

physical interaction of tricorn with its interacting factor F1.1,3,4 Complex formation of tricorn with F1 is transient and appears to be mediated by the peptidic substrate. This mechanism may easily serve to sort tricorn products and funnel them to the downstream protease factors F1, F2, and F3, depending on their substrate preference. Products leave tricorn predominantly via the b6 propeller.2,16 Therefore, if a physical complex of tricorn and F3 were to form, we would expect F3 to dock with its substrate entrance to a b6 propeller of tricorn. Figure 6 illustrates this putative supermolecular complex. It is evident from this Figure how the b6 propeller would match, by its geometric dimension, the entrance domain of F3. We propose that tricorn can hand over its product to the open conformation of F3 only. Concurrent with the conformational "breathing" during its catalytic cycle (Figure 4), F3 would be released from the tricorn protease, allowing tricorn to transfer a newly generated product to the corresponding interacting factor. Clearly, the detailed mechanism of substrate transfer and component interaction awaits further experiments.

Materials and Methods
Protein cloning, expressing, purification and crystallization Molecular biological and biochemical procedures were performed according to standard techniques.17 The F3 gene was amplified in PCR with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) from genomic T. acidophilum DNA, and the product was purified with the QIAprep kit (Qiagen). Restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) were used to insert the F3 gene into pRset6c plasmids that carried ampicillin resistance.18 The ligation reaction was performed overnight at 16 8C with phage T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). The expression vector was cloned in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL cells (Stratagene). The protein was expressed at room temperature overnight and in LB medium containing 70 mM ampicillin and 34 mM chloramphenicol. The expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl. Cell lysis was achieved by sonification and heat-labile proteins were removed by heating the lysate for 20 minutes at 60 8C. The soluble protein was further purified with anion-exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose, followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using OctylSepharose, and finally with size-exclusion chromatography using Superose12. For the incorporation of selenomethionine, E. coli BL21(DE3)RIL cells were used, which were cultivated in minimal medium.19 The purification procedures were the same as those used for the native protein. All columns were from Amersham Pharmacia. All purification steps ¨ were carried out with an AktaExplorer (Amersham Pharmacia). The described procedures yielded milligram quantities of highly purified F3. The purified protein was concentrated to 25 mg/ml and subjected to screenings of different crystallization conditions. Initial crystals appear after two weeks. After optimization of the conditions, hexagonal crystals of F3 were grown from 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 18% (w/w) PEG 2000 and 0.2 M Li2SO4 at 18 8C using the sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion technique. They belong to trigonal space group P3221, with the cell ° ° ° constants aZ105.1 A, bZ105.1 A, cZ178.2 A, aZbZ908, gZ1208, grew to a final size of 0.6 mm!0.3 mm!0.2 mm ° and diffract X-rays to a limiting resolution of 2.7 A with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The second crystal form, which grows under the same conditions to a final size of 0.5 mm!0.3 mm!0.2 mm, belongs to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with cell constants of aZ ° ° ° 115.2 A, bZ183.3 A, cZ105.6 A, aZbZgZ908 and with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The orthorhombic ° crystals diffract X-rays to a limiting resolution of 2.3 A, but could not be cryo-cooled ("frozen") without badly Table 1. X-ray diffraction data and MAD phasing statistics

impairing the diffraction quality. Therefore, it was critical to stabilize both crystal forms by using the Free Mounting System and decreasing the relative humidity of the crystals from 98% to 94% in a jump-like manner.20 These crystals could be flash-frozen at 77 K in liquid nitrogen without loss of diffraction quality. Data collection, processing and structure determination The MAD experiments with synchrotron radiation were carried out at the BW6 beam-line at DESY, Hamburg, with the trigonal crystals. After a wavelength scan for the absorption edge of selenium, data sets were collected on a MAR CCD detector (Mar Research) for ° ° peak (lZ0.9788 A), for inflection point (lZ0.9792 A) and ° for remote (lZ0.9200 A) wavelength up to a resolution of ° 2.7 A. Images in frames of 0.58 were recorded over a range of 1208. For the peak and the inflection wavelength, the reverse beam technique was applied to collect another 1208 for measuring the reflections of the Bijvoet mates. The images were integrated with DENZO21 and scaled with SCALEPACK.21 Further scaling and data analysis were done with the programs TRUNCATE, CAD and SCALEIT of the CCP4 program suite.22 The positions of the selenium atoms were searched with difference Patterson search methods using the program SHELX,23 resulting in maps of the peak wavelength, which show several distinct positions of strong anomalous scatterers. In all, 29 positions were found according to the 29 methionine residues in the F3 sequence. In order to validate these sites and to resolve the handedness ambiguity, (difference) Fourier techniques were applied using the two mutually inverted sets of 29 selenium positions. These sites were refined and phased by using the program MLPHARE (see Table 1)22 and the resulting densities were solvent flattened with the program SOLOMON.22 These procedures allowed us to decide unambiguously on the correct handedness and resulted in a well-defined starting 2FoKFc-map, including data up ° to 2.7 A resolution, in which residues 1­560 are well defined. The C-terminal domain IV was completely undefined in this density. The first model was calculated with the program SOLVE/RESOLVE.24­26 The orthorhombic data set to higher resolution was used to ° improve the resolution to 2.3 A. Density averaging of the molecule of the trigonal space group P3221 and the two molecules in the orthorhombic space group P21212 allowed us to improve the quality of the electron density in the conserved domains (using programs of the CCP4 program suite22 and the program MAIN27). Improved phases could be obtained by back-transforming the locally improved density and combining the experimental and model phases, which allowed us to calculate an excellent electron density for the complete molecule.

Most of the secondary structure elements of the C-terminal domain, including their side-chains, are well defined, except some highly flexible loops, from which only the trace of the backbones is well defined whereas the sidechains are completely without density. In the molecule MOL3 of the trigonal space group, helix H20 is completely disordered in the electron density. Model building and refinement Model building was performed with the interactive 3D graphics program MAIN.27 Most of the side-chains were clearly identified, except the above-mentioned loops and the helix H20. All residues sequentially fit the electron density maps. The resulting model was refined and water molecules were added by the water-pick routine in CNS.28 The quality of the model was cross-validated by using 5% of independent reflections in a test data set. The refinements led to models with excellent parameters for stereochemistry (see Table 2) and with crystallographic R-factors of 22.1% (P3221)/21.3% (P21212) and Rfree of 29.6% (P3221)/26.1% (P21212). More than 96% of all residues in both models lie in the core and in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The stereochemistry of the model was analyzed by the program PROCHECK.29 Protein Data Bank accession code Coordinates and structure factors for the trigonal and the orthorhombic space group of the tricorn interacting factor F3 have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the accession codes 1Z1W and 1Z5H.
