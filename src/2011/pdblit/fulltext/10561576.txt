The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome encodes a highly conserved 16 kDa regulatory gene product, Vpr (viral protein of regulation, 96 amino acid residues), which is incorporated into virions, in quantities equivalent to those of the viral Gag proteins. In the infected cells, Vpr is believed to function in the early phase of HIV-1 replication, including nuclear migration of preintegration complex, transcription of the provirus genome and viral multiplication by blocking cells in the G2 phase. Vpr has a critical role in long-term AIDS disease by inducing infection in nondividing cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Mutations have suggested that the N-terminal domain of Vpr encompassing the first 40 residues could be required for nuclear localization, packaging into virions and binding of transcription factor (TFIIB, Sp1), viral proteins (p6) and cellular proteins (RIP1, UNG, karyopherins). To gain insight into the structure±function relationship of Vpr, (1±51)Vpr was synthesized and its structure analyzed by circular dichroism and two-dimensional 1H NMR in aqueous trifluoroethanol (30%) solution and refined by restrained molecular dynamics. The structure is characterized by three turns around the first three prolines, Pro5, Pro10, Pro14, followed by a long amphipathic a helix-turna helix (Asp17±Ile46) motif ended by a turn extending from Tyr47 to Thr49. The a helix-turn-a helix motif and the amphipathic helix are well known for being implicated in protein±protein or protein±nucleic acid interaction. Therefore structural characteristics of the (1±51) N-terminal fragment of Vpr could explain why this region of Vpr plays a role in several biological functions of this protein. Keywords: helix-turn-helix motif; HIV-1; NMR structure; N-terminal domain; viral protein.

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of AIDS. It belongs to the Retroviridae family of viruses. Among the different groups of retroviruses, primate immunodeficiency viruses are unique members of this family in that, in addition to constitutive gag, pol and env proteins, their mRNA encodes six regulatory (auxiliary) proteins called Tat, Rev, Vif, Vpu, Nef and Vpr (viral protein of regulation), not found in most retroviruses. Several of these proteins such as Tat and Vpr ensure efficient replication of HIV-1 in infected cells, including nondividing cells [1,2]. Among these proteins Vpr is a small basic protein (14 kDa) of 96 amino acids (Fig. 1) conserved in HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus. Vpr, which has been reported to form an oligomer [3], produced late in the virus life cycle, is incorporated in the viral particles at a high copy number, comparable to those of the polyprotein gag [4]. Vpr is essential for efficient infection of cells such as macrophages and monocytes and has an important function in pathogenesis as

the vpr gene was found to be conserved throughout the evolution of the lentiviruses [5]. The C-terminal portion of the gag precursor corresponding to p6, and particularly the motif (LXX)4, appears to be essential for the incorporation of Vpr by interacting with the N-terminal domain of Vpr [6]. In vitro, Vpr forms a complex with the protein of nucleocapsid NCp7 [7] particularly involving the 80±96 domain of Vpr and the second zinc finger of NCp7 [8]. In vivo, the incorporation of Vpr, in HIV-1 mature particles, seems to occur by a process in which NCp7 cooperates with p6 [9]. Recent studies indicate that Vpr has the capacity to arrest the cell cycle of infected cells in the G2 phase, thus contributing to the immunopathogenicity of HIV-1 [10±14]. This process occurs even in the absence of other viral proteins [15,16] and appears to be caused by a blockade of the p34±cyclinB complex formation shown to be essential for the G2-M phase transition [2,17], as well as through a possible interaction with mitochondria to trigger apoptosis [18]. The HIV-1 Vpr protein appears to be an early regulator of apoptosis in HIV-infected T cells [19]. Vpr may also influence the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription by interacting with tRNALys,3 synthetase in its native state and this could implicate the (1±39)Vpr domain [20]. Nuclear proteins could interact with Vpr to facilitate the nuclear transport of the preintegration complex [21], a role that is in keeping with its virion association and accumulation in the nuclei of infected cells [22,23]. For example, RIP-1 appears to be translocated to the nucleus after interaction with both the

glucocorticoid receptor GR-II and the 16±74 domain of Vpr [24]. Moreover, Vpr could play a functional role in nuclear integration of the PIC (pre-integration complex), across the nuclear membrane [25], mediated by the cellular protein karyopherin a and karyopherin b [26]. In the nucleus, Vpr has been reported to bind to many proteins; the 15±77 domain of Vpr interacts with UNG [27], a protein repairing DNA, and with TFIIB [28]. Recently, Bouhamdan et al. [29] have demonstrated that most of the proteins which bind to Vpr contain a common motif WXXF, found in UNG and TFIIB. However, the mechanisms of interaction between Vpr and retroviral or cellular proteins are unknown and therefore a structural study of the protein is a prerequisite to investigating these interactions at the molecular level. Due to its cellular toxicity, Vpr cannot be obtained by classical cell transfection and expression methods which allow production of 15N- and/or 13 C-labelled proteins in large quantities, facilitating their structure determination by NMR. Therefore, as a nonstructured region encompassing the 50±53 sequence was predicted using different algorithms [30±32], the N-terminal (1±51)Vpr and the C-terminal (52±96)Vpr fragment were synthesized (Fig. 1). We have previously determined the structure of the C-terminal domain of Vpr by NMR [33]. In this study, we report the structure of the N-terminal fragment (1±51)Vpr which was determined by circular dichroism and two-dimensional 1H NMR. The structure of (1±51)Vpr presents a long motif of a helixturn-a helix type encompassing the Asp17-Ile46 domain ended by a g turn. Several successive turns localized around three prolines (Pro5, Pro10, Pro14) in the N-terminal domain were also characterized. The first a helix, extending from Asp17 to Glu29, shows a clear separation between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces, and the second a helix also has an amphipathic nature. The first a helix could account for the interactions of the N-terminal domain of Vpr with several targets, as this type of structure is well-known to be involved in protein±protein or protein±lipid interactions.

solid phase method [DCC/hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) as coupling reagent]. Synthesized peptide was cleaved from the resin, and side chain protections removed at room temperature for 3 h as already described [35]. Resin was filtered and solvents partially removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. After precipitation of the residue in cold diethyl ether, the crude peptide was dissolved in water and lyophilized. Purification of the peptide was carried out by HPLC with a C4 VYDAC column using an acetonitrile gradient. The peptide was analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry and found to have a purity higher than 98%. It is important to note that Vpr or its fragments cannot be obtained in large quantities by classical methods of transfection because this protein is highly toxic for cells classically used for protein expression, arresting division in the G2 phase of the cell cycle [10,11]. Circular dichroism measurements CD were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon (Longjumeau, France), CD6 spectrodichrograph, using a cell with a 1-mm path length. The temperature was recorded at 293 ^ 0.1 K and the wavelength increment and accumulation time used were 0.2 nm and 1 s per step, respectively. Each spectrum was obtained at a peptide concentration of 2 Â 1025 m in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 6 and pH 3, and with increasing concentrations of trifluoroethanol from 0 to 30%. All spectra resulted from averaging four successive individual spectra and baseline corrected spectra were smoothed by using 3rd order least-squares polynomial fit. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments The NMR samples of (1±51)Vpr were prepared by dissolving 6.4 mg of the protein in 0.5 mL of water containing 30% trifluoroethanol-d2 (S.d.S, Peypin, France) leading to a final solution of 2 mm. The pH was adjusted to the desired values: 3.4 and 6 with NaOD or DCl solutions. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded at 293 K, 303 K, 313 K and 323 K on a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer with the carrier frequency set to the water resonance. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive 1H clean-TOCSY (70 ms spin lock) [36] and NOESY (mixing times 50 ms, 100 ms, 150 ms and 200 ms) [37] spectra utilizing time-proportional phase incrementation [38] were recorded. The temperature was externally controlled using the SK107 unit (Haake, Karlsruhe, Germany). The water signal was suppressed by weak presaturation during 1.6 s relaxation and during the mixing time for NOESY experiments. FIDs (512) of 128 scans were collected using the time-proportional phase incrementation method. The spectral width was about 12 p.p.m. in both dimensions.

Peptide synthesis and characterization of (1±51)Vpr Peptide synthesis of (1±51)Vpr was performed on an Applied Biosystems 431 synthetiser, using procedures already reported for the preparation of other retroviral proteins [8,34]. All reagents, solvents and protected amino acids, were obtained from Applied Biosystem. The first amino acid was coupled on HMP (4-hydroxymethylphenoxymethyl-copolystyrene 1% divinylbenzene) resin with DCC (N,N H -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)/dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as coupling reagents. Assembly of the peptide was then carried out using a stepwise

Data were zero filled to 2K Â 1K real points and apodized 1 using phase-shifted (1 to 2X5) sine-squared or (1 to 1) sine-bell 2 6 3 functions in both dimensions before Fourier transformations È with UXNMR (Bruker). The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to hexamethyldisiloxane (Peypin, France) used as an internal standard. Additional baseline correction was performed using the softÈ È ware supplied by Bruker incorporated on a Bruker X32 computer. Structure calculations NOE cross-signal volumes (NOESY, 323 K) were converted into distances either by a r26 dependency for well resolved peak or semiquantitatively by counting levels. The few crosscorrelation peaks which were not observed using tm of 50 ms were not used in the calculations to avoid possible diffusion spin artefacts. The distances were calibrated using Trp H5-H6 protons. A total of 503 distance constraints (245 intraresidues, 258 interresidues) derived from NMR experiments were classified, Ê Ê for the first time, into three categories: 1.8±2.5 A, 1.8±3.5 A, Ê 1.8±4.5 A corresponding, respectively, to strong, medium and weak NOEs. During the refinement procedures three additional categories were used, corresponding to distance ranges of Ê Ê Ê 1.8±3.0 A, 1.8±4.0 A, 1.8±5.0 A for intermediary NOEs. Pseudo-atom corrections were added when necessary and È interproton distances corrected according to Wuthrich [39,40]. All calculations were performed using the discover/ nmrchitect software package from Biosym Technologies with Amber forcefield. A first preliminary minimization (: = 4r) of the linear peptide was realized, with NMR-distance-restraints using 1000 steps of steepest descents followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradients, in order to fold up (1±51)Vpr before simulated annealing (: = 4*r). Structures (70) were generated using a restrained dynamic simulated annealing protocol and refined by energy minimization. This protocol consists of heating the systems at 1000 K for 1 ps and then maintain them at this temperature for 3 ps before a cooling procedure which led the system to a final temperature of 300 K in five steps of 2, 1.7, 5 and 5 ps each. The NOE derived constraints were maintained by a force constant of Ê 30 kcal´mol21´A22 throughout the refinement process. All peptide bonds were forced into trans orientation by torsional constraints with a force constant of 200 kcal´mol21, operating for deviations higher than 10 degrees from the trans form. The dielectric constant was set to be distance-dependent (: = 4*r) in order to diminish electrostatic in vacuo effects. During the dynamic steps, the nonbonding terms were reduced to a simple quadratic van der Waal's repulsion with radii scaled by a factor of 0.85. The resulting structures were then energy-minimized using a Lennard-Jones nonbonding term, under NOE restraints, by conjugate gradients until a maximum derived value was less Ê than 0.001 kcal´mol21´A21. The 16 best energy minimized structures with the lowest values for total energies and NOE restraint violations are described [41]. Finally, rmsd values with respect to the backbone were used for final structure analysis.

trifluoroethanol at pH 6 and pH 3. In water solution, the CD spectrum was characteristic of an ordered a helix, whatever the pH, as typical double minima at 208 nm and 222 nm and typical maxima at 190 nm and 210 nm were observed [42±44] (Fig. 2A,B). Addition of increasing concentrations of trifluoroethanol (until 30%) to the solution slightly enhanced and stabilized the pre-existing a structure [45,46] (Fig. 2A,B).

H NMR studies of the N-terminal Vpr

In a first attempt, we tried to analyze the 1H NMR spectra of (1±51)Vpr in pure H2O at pH 6 but due to its low solubility and its strong tendency to self-aggregate, the peptide gave broadened signals in the 293 K to 323 K temperature range. However, no important modification in the one-dimensional spectrum occurred during this temperature variation (not shown). The higher temperature (323 K) was selected for all

The two maximum at 208 and 222 nm indicate that (1±51)Vpr is structured in a helix, stabilized in presence of 30% trifluoroethanol.

One-dimensional 600 MHz 1H NMR of (1±51)Vpr (region of aromatic and amide protons) at 323 K in aqueous 30% trifluoroethanol at pH 6 (top); in the absence of trifluoroethanol at pH 3.4 (middle); in aqueous 30% trifluoroethanol at pH 3.4 (bottom). The addition of 30% trifluoroethanol leads to signal sharpening very likely resulting from oligomerization disappearance.

NMR studies due to the sharpening of the signals and the largest scattering of the proton resonances, suggesting the occurrence of a structure within the peptide sequence. Acidification of the aqueous solution (pH 3.4) enhanced slightly the solubility of (1±51)Vpr (Fig. 3, middle) and addition of 30% trifluoroethanol induced a sharpening of the signals (Fig. 3, bottom). Both conditions are well known to make aggregation caused by protein±protein interaction vanish. However, a new experiment performed in aqueous 30%

trifluoroethanol at pH 6 showed clearly the absence of crucial modification of the position of the proton signals not only in the amide and aromatic regions (Fig. 3, top) but also in the other parts of the spectrum (not shown). Moreover, the NOE connectivities were the same, in agreement with the results of CD experiments. This strongly suggest that the main structural characteristics of (1±51)Vpr are maintained in these different conditions. The structure of (1±51)Vpr was therefore investigated by 1H NMR in a 2-mm aqueous solution containing 30% trifluoroethanol-d2 adjusted at pH 6 and pH 3.4 (Fig. 3) in the same solution conditions as those used to analyze the structure of the (52±96) C-terminal domain of Vpr [33]. Sequence-specific assignment of N-terminal Vpr protons was obtained by first identifying amino acid spin systems using direct and relayed-through-bond connectivities, followed by the Ê sequential assignment of resonances by means of short (, 5 A) through-space connectivities [40]. Therefore clean-TOCSY and NOESY were used for spin identification, and cross signals connecting NH, Ha and Hb of residue i with NH of residue i + 1 for sequential assignment. A secondary structure analysis based on the observed strong NOEs NN(i,i + 1), ab(i,i + 1) suggested the presence of two a helices spanning residues 17±32 and 36±47, consistent with the CD data showing an a-helical folding. The NOE connectivities are summarized in Figs 4 and 5. A complete pattern of strong, sequential dNN(i,i + 1) NOE connectivities and a nearly complete pattern of daN(i,i + 1) NOEs was observed for the sequence 18±32. The daN(i,i + 4), dNN(i,i + 2) and dNb(i,i±1) NOE connectivities support the formation of structure of the 16±18 domain that corresponds to the first part of the helix. The occurrence of a typical a helix was reinforced by the observation of a series of NOE crosspeaks of daN (i,i + 4) type. The absence of NN(i,i + 1) and

aN(i,i + 1) in the region (33±35) correlated with the presence of characteristic dab(i,i + 3), dNa(i,i ± 3) and daN(i,i ± 4) suggesting the presence of a turn as for the 6±11 sequence (Figs 4 and 5). The Ha protons of residues 47, 48, 49 and 50 were highfield shifted and dNa(i,i ± 2), dNN(i,i + 1) and daN(i,i + 1) NOE connectivities suggest a structuring which could correspond to a turn or a nascent helix. NMR derived three-dimensional structure of (1±51)Vpr The structure of (1±51)Vpr were obtained by a simulated annealing protocol and energy minimization using 503 distance constraints of which 245 were intraresidual, 109 were sequential and 149 were medium range distances. The final structure set allows several structured regions to be identified within (1±51)Vpr with total rms deviations of the Ê backbone atoms (N,Ca,C H ,O) of at most 1.0 A.

Structures (16) endowed with the lowest total energies and the lowest NOE restraint violations were used for structural analysis (Table 1). The superposition of the structures is shown in Fig. 6. The (1±51) N-terminal domain of Vpr consists of both structured helical conformations and turns with a well-defined a helix-turn-a helix, interrupted at position 34 and by four turns of b and g types. The motif a helix-turn-a helix, extending from Asp17 to Ile46, has the second helix part less defined than the first. This first a-helical domain of 13 amino acids is followed by a b turn type IV and then by the second a helix of 12 amino acids corresponding to the 35±46 fragment (Figs 6 and 7). To analyze the amphipathic property of the a helix, the amino acid side chains have been classified into two categories according to their preferences for aqueous or nonpolar environments by using their hydrophilic coefficients.

The first a helix localized in the region Asp17-Glu29 presents the structural characteristics of an amphipathic helix as this domain of Vpr presents two faces of opposite amphipathicity with the hydrophobic face more extended (Figs 7 and 8). The mainly hydrophobic face is formed with the amino acid side chains of Trp18, Thr19, Leu20, Leu22, Leu23 and Leu26, and the hydrophilic face consists of the amino acid side chain Asp17, Glu21, Glu24, Glu25, Lys27, Asn28, Glu29. The average rmsd for the superimposed backbone atoms (N,Ca,C H ,O) for Asp17±Glu29 is Ê 0.20 ^ 0.1 A (Figs 6±8). The second a helix localized in the region Pro35±Ile46 is rather amphipathic although to a lesser extent than the 17±29 domain. The hydrophilic amino acid side chains of Arg36, Ser41 and Gln44 are located on one side of the helix and the hydrophobic amino acid side chains of Trp38, Leu39, Leu42, His45 and Ile46 on the other side. Two residues Ile37 and His40 are localized on the former surface hindering the formation of a perfect amphipathic a helix. The average rmsd for the superimposed backbone atoms (N,Ca,C H ,O) for this helix is Ê 0.31 ^ 0.1 A (Figs 7 and 8). Between these two a helices, a b turn type IV (Ala30-His33) leads to a quasi-perpendicular orientation of the two helices (Figs 6, 7 and 8). The average rmsd value for the superimposed Ê backbone atoms (N, Ca, C H , O) for this turn is 0.41 ^ 0.1 A.

Four other regions of the peptide are structured in different types of turns, three of them being structured around a proline residue (Fig. 9). The first one, from Ala4 to Glu6, forms an almost perfect g turn with a proline in the second position stabilized by the H-bond CO4-NH6 and characterized by typical F, C angles (FPro5, CPro5 = 708, ±708). This turn is conserved in all structures with an average rmsd equal to Ê 0.51 ^ 0.1 A. The second turn, extending from Gln8 to Gln11, including a proline in position 10, is a b turn type III, with a perfect F, C angle arrangement (F, C Gly9-Pro10) = ±608, ±308 (Fig. 9). This turn is slightly less defined in the 16 Ê structures explaining the higher averaged rmsd (0.85 ^ 0.1 A). The third turn, which could be considered as a nascent helix, consists of Pro14, Tyr15 and Asn16 residues, containing a g Ê turn (rmsd 0.84 ^ 0.2 A) with a H-bond CO14-NH16 and typical dihedral angle values FTyr15, CTyr15 = 708, ±708 (Fig. 9). The last turn is again a g turn (Tyr47 to Thr49) with the H-bond CO47-NH49 and (FGlu48, CGlu48) = 608, ±608 (Fig. 9).

DISCUSSION

involved in many functions of the protein [21,47] and which has recently been reported to have karyophilic properties [48]. CD experiments have shown that this domain is mainly under a-helix conformation in aqueous solution whatever the pH (pH 3.4 or pH 6) as illustrated by the curves (Fig. 2) characterized by two minima at 208 nm and 222 nm and the

presence of two maxima at 190 nm and 212 nm which are typical of ordered helices [43,44]. The addition of 30% trifluoroethanol, known to decrease hydrogen bonding of amide protons to water and consequently to favor intramolecular hydrogen bonds, enhanced the a-helical conformation in structured regions, as previously described for many

other protein fragments. However, it is very important to observe that trifluoroethanol has been found to stabilize helix in regions that have already a high propensity for helix formation [49±54]. Segawa et al. [45] and Dyson et al. [45] have also demonstrated that only peptide fragments corresponding to helical segments formed in the native proteins adopt secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol. For Nelson & Kallenbach [53] the stabilized structure (in trifluoroethanol) should be the same as that formed in the absence of the organic solvent. This explains why b hairpins could also be stabilized by trifluoroethanol [55]. The role of relatively low concentrations (, 30%) of trifluoroethanol is therefore to stabilize such pre-existing secondary-structure conformations with increased flexibility in aqueous solution. The presence of a large part of (1±51)Vpr under a-helical conformation is definitively demonstrated by the NMR study showing a number of medium range connectivities (i,i + 3) and (i,i + 4) in the NOESY spectra throughout the sequence of the peptide (Figs 2 and 10). The present results show that the (1±51) domain of Vpr is highly structured as only nine amino acids (Met1, Glu2, Gln3, Asp7, Arg12, Glu13, Phe34, Tyr50 and Gly51) are not well defined. This is in keeping with the NMR results showing no Na(i,i±1) correlations for these nine residues and with their chemical shifts which are found at lower field compared to those of the 42 other amino acids. Nevertheless, it is not surprising that the first residues (Met1, Glu2 and Gln3) and the last two (Tyr50 and Gly51), constituting the N-terminal and C-terminal domain of (1±51)Vpr, are not involved in the secondary structure. The (1±51) fragment of Vpr forms a series of three turns, around the first three prolines, of b type (Ala4±Glu6) and g types (Gln8±Gln11, Pro14±Asn16), followed by a very well defined a helix-turn-a helix of 30 residues, encompassing Asp17-Ile46, followed by a g turn around the Tyr47±Thr49 sequence (Fig. 9). The presence of three domains structured with different types of turn (b or g) is not surprising as they are organized around proline residues (Pro5, Pro10 and Pro14) well known to promote the formation of bends. In the a helix-turn-a helix motif, only one residue, Phe34, is less strictly defined in the structure but this did not disrupt the spatial disposition of the a helix-turn-a helix motif. These two a-helical domains (Asp17±Glu29, Pro35±Ile46) present amphipathic characteristics (Figs 7 and 8). This could explain the oligomerization properties of Vpr and the difficulties of its solubilization in 100% H2O at concentrations of 1 mm or 2 mm. The helix-turn-helix region of Vpr could explain the capacity of Vpr to participate in the nuclear transport of the proviral DNA [56] as it is well known that these types of motif are characteristic of DNA binding domain. Thus during the early stages of HIV-1 replication, binding of NCp7 to the C-terminal domain of Vpr (Figs 6, 7) may expose the N-terminal portion of the protein, allowing its tight binding to tLys-tRNA synthetase [20] and in the latter stages of infection, the N-terminus of Vpr could be complexed with tRNA synthetase with the HIV-1 encoded p6. This notion of the a amphipathic helix (Aps17-Glu29) is very important as it is commonly observed in the structural motifs that involve protein±protein and protein±lipid interaction. This helix exhibits well-demarcated hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the virion-associated protein encoded by HIV-2 Vpx presents a high homology sequence and an amphipathic helical structure in its N-terminal domain and, like Vpr, its incorporation depends on Gag [57].

The tendency of (1±51)Vpr to form an oligomer can thus be explained by these amphipathic a helices which also occur over the entire protein [21,47]. The fact that amphipathic a helices are well known to oligomerize by their hydrophobic face explains the oligomerization property of Vpr. The NMR structure of (1±51)Vpr and its dimerization tendency also accounts for the resistance of wild type Vpr to trypsin digestion of the basic amino acid residues located in the 1±73 region [21]. The hydrophobicity of the Vpr helix can explain its capacity to dimerize, as well as the observations that antibodies in HIV-1 infected patients preferentially recognize the Vpr dimer [58]. The incorporation of Vpr in the virus particle requires its integration with the core protein Gag [4,59,60] through a possible interaction with a leucine triplet repeat sequence (LXX)4 found in p6, the C-terminal domain of Gag [61]. It has been reported by mutagenesis that virion incorporation was

dependent on the N-terminal domain and mainly on the 17±34 sequence [23,62±64]. Mutations in the a helix (E25K, L23F, E24P, E21P, E29P, D17P, L26P) induced the elimination of (1±96)Vpr incorporation in new virus particles. This is supported by the NMR structure as these mutations are expected to disrupt the first amphipathic a helix thus making protein±protein interactions involving Vpr vanish. Recent studies showed that Vpr interacts with the primer for reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome and could influence the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription [20], very likely through interaction with Lys-tRNA synthetase. The domains of Vpr involved in this interaction are (1±39) and (35±96) with a preference for the N-terminal domain of the protein. It is interesting to observe that our NMR results have revealed the presence of two amphipathic helices (17±29), both in the N-terminal domain (this study), and in the C-terminal (53±78) sequence [33] which encompasses a large part of the domain that recognizes Lys-tRNA synthetase. Bukrinsky et al. [65] proposed a model of HIV nuclear import in which Vpr enhances the complex between karyopherin a and the two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the terminal domain of the HIV matrix (NLS1, NLS2) forming a bipartite NLS. Due to the binding of Vpr, karyopherin a could change its conformation, and the complex may be transported by karyopherin b to nucleoporins [66]. Karyopherin a, karyopherin b, matrix and Vpr could assemble in a tetrameric complex which allows transport of the viral preintegration complex into the nucleus of nondividing cells. Such a role is consistent with the presence of Vpr in the nucleus [22,64] and with its membrane localization [22,25]. This capacity of Vpr to bind to karyopherins and to transport the PIC to the nucleus could be explained by its secondary structure (a helix-turna helix) which is well known to favor protein/protein complex formation, and to have the potential of interacting with the phospholipid bilayer. Vpr has been reported to form cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers in vitro [67]. The NMR structure of (1±51)Vpr shows that Glu21, Glu25 and Glu29 located on one side of the a helix could easily interact by saltbridge formations with residues Arg73, Gln65, Gln66, Arg62 and Glu58 found on one side of the a helix of (52±96)Vpr [33]. Furthermore, both a-helical domains were also shown to be essential for nuclear localization of Vpr and the in vivo stability of Vpr [23,47,62]. In conclusion, the helix-turn-helix found in the solution structure of the 1±51 N-terminal domain of Vpr could explain, at least partly, some of the most important properties of this viral protein.
