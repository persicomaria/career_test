Crystallographic

Study of Plastocyanins

C'ryst,als of plastocyanins from pea and corn lea\-es ha\Te been obt,ained. Rot11 are suitable for X-ray structure analysis with a resolution up to 1.8 8. The crystal form of plastocyanin from pea leaves belorlgs to the space group P2I2,21 wit,h unit ~11 dimensions: a = 4!).0 A, b = 53.3 A, c = 82.6 B. The assumed member of prot,ein molecules per asymmetric unit of the unit cell is two. Crystals of the oxidized (CuZf ) and reduced (Cu' ) forms are isomorphic. No essential differences in spot intensities for the main zone' with a resolution of 3 A were rcxvealed. The crystal form of plastocyanin from corn leaves belongs to the space group 1'1 with unit cell parameters: a = 24.8 A, b = 30.0 A, c = 58.5 Ai and a := M"10'. /? = 87"08', y :. 78"40'. The nssumcvI nllmhcr of prokin molecules pvr asymnwtric unit is two. Plnstocynnin is one of the main proteins of the electron t,ransport chain in photosynthetic systems. This protein has been found in many photosynthetic organisms including higher plants and bacteria. Plastocyanins usually have a molecular weight, of about 10,500 and conta'in one copper atom. In some cases, however, for example in spinach plastocyanin, a quaternary structure seems to be observed with a total molecular weight of about' 40,000 (Siegelman et al., 1976). In this letter we present data from a crystallographic study of plastocyanins from pea and corn leaves. Plastocyanin from pea leaves (Pisum satiwum L.) was isolated using the procedure described by Garber et al. (1976). Plastocyanin from corn leaves (Zea may) was kindly presented by Dr N. F. PJesnayko (Institute of Photosynthesis, Poustchino). Both preparations were purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G75 and by chromatograph> on DEAF,-cellulose. The proteins were homogeneous according to data obtained from gel electrophoresis. In the oxidized form they had an absorption spectrum typical for plastocyanins, the absorption ratio A,7,/A5S7 was in the range of 1.1 t'o 1.3. Crystallization of the pea plastocyanin was done in a 1 to 29/o solution of the oxidized protein (deep blue) in a 0.05 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 0.1 mM-CuSO, sulphate as a precipitant was introduced gradually int'o at about ~-4"c). Ammonium the protein solution by dialysis. At 67 y0 saturation with ammonium sulphate needle-like microcrystals a few micromet'res long usually appeared. Sometimes under the same conditions rod-like microcrystals with a rectangular cross-section also appeared. The lat,ter were used as seeds to grow large monocrystals. Seeds were introduced int'o a 1) <, protein solution saturated with ammonium sulphate up to 5Ooj. The crystals were grown in closed glass bottles at room temperature. The relaxation method was applied to increase the crystal size: twice a week the concentration of ammonium sulphate was reduced to 451~`; saturation and aft,er the crystals had partially melted the initial concentration of the precipitant was re-established. During a month we succeeded in growing large monocrystals in the form of rectangular parallelepipeds (Fig. l(a)). The crystals were stored at room temperature in the dark in 77?' saturated ammonium sulphate solution (pH 7.0) wit,h 0.1 IUM-CUSO,. The colourless plastocyanin crystals in the reduced form (Cu + ) were obtained by adding sodium dithionite to the mother liquor up to a concentration of 15 mg/ml.

Crystallization of corn plastocyanin in the oxidized form was carried out in ly,;, protein solution in a 0.05 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 3 to 5 M solutions of different salts, at about $-5°C. To grow large monocrystals we used 3 M-(NH,)$O, or 1.5 M-(NH,),SO, + 1.5 M-NaH,PO, )- 1.5 M-CsCI. We studied the crystals grown with the latter salt composition. Addition of 0.1 mu-C&O, to t'he protein solution did not make any difference. Usually large enough crystals in the form of thin plates appeared after a week (Fig. 2(a)). Crystals larger t,han those indicated in Table 1

were of a. worse quality because of many microcracks. The monocrystals suitable for X-ray measurement were fragile, so we measured them in a small drop of mother liquor. The reduced form of the crystals could be obtained by adding dithiothreitol to the mother liquor. The crystal density of pea plastocyanin was measured by the floatation method in a Ficoll/water solution (Westbrook, 1976). We failed to measure the crystal density of corn plastocyanin because these cryst'als dissolved in the Ficoll solution (Pharmacia.) The precession photographs of the main zones were taken with Nonius cameras. CuKu radiation was used, the Elliott GX6 rotating anode generator was operated at 35 kV and 3.5 mA. The size of the focal spot was 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm. Unit cell dimensions were taken from the photographs using the automatic microdensitometer AD-l. Syntex, and were increased by 0.15o;b due to film shrinkage. Examples of precession photographs are presented in Figure l(b) and Figure 2(b). According to systematic absences, the space group of pea plastocyanin crystal in t'he oxidized form was found to be orthorhombic and the space group of corn plastocyanin crystal to be triclinic. The dimensions of unit cells and other crystal data are given in Table 1. The crystals are stable in the X-ray beam for more than 40 hours. We have investigated also the reduced form of pea plastocyanin crystals. These crystals are converted into the oxidized form after three hours of exposure in the X-ray beam. The crystals of the oxidized and reduced forms are isomorphic. We did not observe any considerable differences in spot intensities of the Olcl zone taken with a resolution of about 3 A. The possible number of molecules in the unit cell has been estimated

1968). It is reasonable that this using the Matthews parameter V, (Matthews, number is eight for the crystals of pea and two for corn plastocyanin because the Twelve molecules in vi?4 values are equal to 257 and 2.02 i13/dalton. respectively. the unit cell of pea plastocyanin seem improbable since in this case T', will be equal to 1.71 A3/dalton. Therefore, the assumed number of molecules in the asymmetric part, of the unit cell is two for both plastocyanin crystals. Llsing a partial specific volume of 0.74 cm3/g, we have calculated t,he solvent content of the crystals (Table 1). `I'hc authors are grateful to Drs XT-.E. Erokhin and V. A.
