The 3D structure of monomeric C-truncated Escherichia coli methionyltRNA synthetase, a class 1 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, has been solved Ê at 2.0 A resolution. Remarkably, the polypeptide connecting the two halves of the Rossmann fold exposes two identical knuckles related by a 2-fold axis but with zinc in the distal knuckle only. Examination of available MetRS orthologs reveals four classes according to the number and zinc content of the putative knuckles. Extreme cases are exempli®ed by the MetRS of eucaryotic or archaeal origin, where two knuckles and two metal ions are expected, and by the mitochondrial enzymes, which are predicted to have one knuckle without metal ion.

Introduction
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) catalyze the aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs through a two-step mechanism involving an activation of the amino acid by ATP, to yield aminoacyl adenylate, followed by transfer onto the 3H end of the tRNA molecule. Accordingly, the catalytic speci®city and ef®ciency of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key features of the translation process. This family of enzymes was divided into two classes depending on the structure of their catalytic

center (Eriani et al., 1990). Class 1 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are characterised by a catalytic center built around a Rossmann fold where the two signature sequences HIGH and KMSKS are systematically found, while class 2 enzymes possess a central antiparallel b-sheet. Numerous biochemical and structural studies have led to the idea that aaRS are modular enzymes, containing several domains appended to the catalytic core and having speci®c functions. This has been illustrated recently by the 3D-structure of IleRS (Nureki et al., 1998), which shows a structurally separated module responsible for the hydrolysis of misactivated ValAMP or of misacylated Val-tRNAIle (Lin et al., 1996). This module is inserted between the two halves of the Rossmann fold, within a region called the connective polypeptide (CP). All class 1 enzymes possess such a CP appendix, the length and 3D structure of which appear variable. Among class 1 aaRS, Escherichia coli methionyltRNA synthetase (EcMetRS) has been extensively studied at the biochemical level. This enzyme

However, a fully active monomeric MetRS retaining one zinc ion could be obtained from C-terminal truncation by mild trypsinolysis in vitro (Cassio & Waller, 1971; Kalogerakos et al., 1980; Mellot et al., 1989). The same monomeric species, produced in vivo by genetic engineering, is able to complement an E. coli mutant defective in MetRS activity (Mellot et al., 1989). Similar C-truncations releasing active singlechain MetRS were observed in the cases of the Bacillus stearothermophilus (Kalogerakos et al., 1980), Thermus thermophilus (Kohda et al., 1987) and sheep liver (Mirande et al., 1982) enzymes. Interpretation of structure-function relationships of MetRS has suffered from the lack of comprehensive structural data, in spite of the pioneering work of Waller and associates, who obtained crystals diffracting to Ê 1.8 A resolution (Waller et al., 1971). Biochemical data (e.g. see Ghosh et al., 1991a) could not be fully explained on the basis of the ensuing 3D model (Brunie et al., 1990). Very recently, the structure of a monomeric fragment of Thermus thermophilus MetRS (TtMetRS) has Ê been solved at 2.0 A resolution (Sugiura et al., 1999). Determination of the 3D structure of the Ê monomeric E. coli enzyme at 2.0 A resolution was facilitated by the availability of the 3D structure of TtMetRS as well as by new collections of native and heavy-atom derivative data from EcMetRS crystals. This structure sheds a new light on the interpretation of the biochemical properties of EcMetRS. In addition, according to the 3D structure and the sequence of their CP domain, we propose a classi®cation of MetRS of different origins into four subsets.

Structure of E. coli Methionyl-tRNA Synthetase

Results and Discussion
Overall structure The crystal structure of a genetically engineered E. coli monomeric methionyl-tRNA synthetase composed of 551 residues was solved by using solvent-¯attened MIR maps, into which the re®ned model of the monomeric TtMetRS (PDB access code 1A8H) was used as a guide for model construction. The initial model showed an R value of Ê 45 % for the data between 8 and 4 A resolution. During the course of re®nement and phase extenÊ sion to 20-2.03 A resolution, the regions that could not be constructed in the initial model, in particular the zinc-binding domain, stood out clearly and could be unambiguously assigned. Eventually, the obtained model showed all the residues from Val3 to Glu548, plus one zinc ion and 179 water molecules, with an R-free value of 21.4 % (R  17.0 %), and a very good geometry. Four domains are distinguishable in the 3D structure of the M551 enzyme (Figure 1). (i) The classical Rossmann fold (colored red in Figure 1) results from a ®ve-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded on each side by two alpha-helices. It con-

tains two additional helices, a1 and a5 (colored pink in Figure 1). (ii) Inserted between the two halves of the Rossmann fold is the so-called connective polypeptide (CP, green in Figure 1), one part of which forms the zinc-binding region protruding above the active-site crevice. On the basis of the previously published 3D model of MetRS, it was thought that two non-contiguous regions, called CP1 and CP2, were inserted within the nucleotide-binding fold. The present structure unambiguously shows that these insertions actually correspond to a single one. (iii) A small domain bordering the catalytic crevice follows the ®fth strand of the Rossmann fold, bE. This domain is composed of two short parallel beta-strands connected by two alpha-helices, a6 and a7 (yellow in Figure 1), and contains the KMSKS signature peptide (Hountondji et al., 1986). (iv) The C-domain (blue in Figure 1) comprises a helix bundle with helices a9 to a14. The C-terminal helix, a15, folds back towards the KMSKS domain and packs against the a6 and a8 helices as well as against the KMSKS loop. The a8 and a15 helices may therefore be considered to contribute to the KMSKS domain. As shown in Figure 2, the EcMetRS structure is Ê very similar to that of TtMetRS (rmsd is 1.6 A for 419 C-alpha atoms). The most notable difference between the two MetRS species lies in both the topology and the orientation of the connective polypeptide (see below). Two other structural variations can be noticed. First, the connections of the a5 helix are shorter in TtMetRS than in EcMetRS; this causes a slight difference in the position of this helix relative to the core of the catalytic domain. Second, conformations of the KMSKS loops are different in the two enzymes; it may re¯ect the fact that the monomeric fragment of TtMetRS lacks the a15 helix. Notably, an EcMetRS variant truncated after R537 and deprived of the a15 helix is active but becomes highly temperature-sensitive (Mellot et al., 1989). Zinc-binding domain The ®rst half of the Rossmann fold ends with the bC strand (residue 96) and is connected to the aC helix (residue 252) through a 155 residue polypeptide called the connective polypeptide (CP). This region distinctly forms an isolated domain located over the catalytic crevice of EcMetRS (green domain in Figure 1); it is formed by a fourstranded antiparallel beta-sheet (b1, b4, b5 and b6) surrounded by the zinc-binding domain on the one side and by two alpha-helices (a3 and a4) on the other. The zinc-binding knuckle was previously produced as an isolated domain and its 3D structure was solved by NMR (Fourmy et al., 1993a,b). The obtained fold is superimposable on that deduced from the present crystallographic structure. We therefore conclude that the MetRS zinc-binding knuckle folds independently of the rest of the enzyme.

The structural domains are coloured: Rossmann fold in red, CP domain in green, KMSKS domain in yellow and C-terminal domain in blue. Two supplementary helices added to the Rossmann fold (a1 and a5) are in pink.

Interestingly, comparison of the Tt and Ec enzymes shows that the zinc-binding domain of EcMetRS corresponds to a duplication of the zincbinding knuckle of TtMetRS. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3, the E. coli knuckle (in white) that holds the zinc ion is inserted inside a motif identical with the zinc-binding knuckle of TtMetRS (in yellow). Therefore, E. coli MetRS displays two very similar structural motifs related by a 2-fold axis but with zinc in the distal motif only. In this distal motif, zinc is co-ordinated by four Cys side-chains (145, 148, 158 and 161). This organization is compatible with the 1:1 stoichiometry between zinc and the EcMetRS monomer (Posorske et al., 1979; Mayaux & Blanquet, 1981). Despite the absence of metal, the proximal motif of EcMetRS adopts a structure that nicely superimposes on that of the zinc-bindÊ ing knuckle of TtMetRS (rmsd 1.2 A; see Figure 3). Instead of the zinc-chelating CVSC and CPIH motifs of TtMetRS, the proximal knuckle of EcMetRS has 129DPEK132 and 175SVVS178. The sidechains of D129, S175 and S178 stabilize the knuckle by three hydrogen bonds. Figure 2 shows that a satisfying sequence alignment between TtMetRS and EcMetRS can be deduced from the structural superimposition of the zinc-binding domains. It should be underlined that

in this comparison, the zinc ligands of TtMetRS are not aligned with those of EcMetRS. We extended this alignment strategy to all known MetRS sequences. Interestingly, the analysis summarised in Figure 3 predicts four families characterized by their numbers of knuckles and of zinc-binding sites in the CP region. In the MetRS of eukaryotic or archaeal origin, the CP region is expected to always carry two metal ions. This should be the case also for MetRS from Spirochetes. Two other families, with either two knuckles and one zinc ion or one knuckle and one zinc ion, are exempli®ed by EcMetRS and TtMetRS, respectively. MetRS from Bacillus stearothermophilus belongs to the family of TtMetRS. The B. stearothermophilus enzyme was indeed shown to contain one zinc ion per subunit (Kalogerakos et al., 1980). The fourth subset contains enzymes structurally close to TtMetRS but lacking any metal ion (Figure 3). In accordance with this prediction, zinc could not be detected in MetRS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Kim et al., 1998). Notably, in the two families that have one knuckle devoid of zinc, hydrogen bond donors are systematically found at the positions corresponding to D129 of motif 1, and to S175 and S178 of motif 4 in the EcMetRS sequence (see Figure 3 for a de®nition of motifs 1, 2, 3 and 4).

Left: The secondary structure elements of EcMetRS are indicated on the top of the aligned sequences. The EcMetRS sequence is above the TtMetRS sequence. Right: Stereoview of the C-alpha backbone of EcMetRS (yellow) Ê superimposed on that of TtMetRS (blue). The rms is 1.6 A for 416 pairs of C-alpha atoms. The superimposition was made with O (Jones et al., 1991).

Beside their putative zinc contents, the enzymes of each family are characterized by sequence conservations (Figure 3). For instance, families with two knuckles feature an FLXDR sequence between motifs 1 and 2, and a GD sequence between motifs 2 and 3. Finally, it should be pointed out that the four-family classi®cation of MetRS does not coincide with the phylogenetic relationships between the corresponding species as established from 5 S RNA sequences (Woese et al., 1990). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of EcMetRS (Fourmy et al., 1993b, 1995) sustain the idea that the zinc-binding domain plays a central role in methionine activation as well as in amino acid transfer onto the 3H end of tRNA. The same conclusion could be reached in the cases of the thermostable MetRS from T. thermophilus (Nureki et al., 1993) and B. stearothermophilus (Schmitt et al., 1997). These studies led to the proposal that the metal ion contributes to the correct orientation of side-chains involved in catalysis. Within the zinc knuckle, three residues belonging to the FLXDR conserved sequence are important for the E. coli enzyme activity: D138 and R139, whose mutations to alanine strongly reduce the rate of methionine activation, and F135, which acts at the level of the tRNA aminoacylation step (Fourmy et al., 1995). The location of these residues, far from the catalytic center, argues for the occurrence of a motion of the CP domain during catalysis. In this view it is notable that superimposition of the Rossmann

folds of EcMetRS and TtMetRS reveals distinct orientations of the CP domains with respect to the catalytic center (Figure 2). Such a difference may re¯ect a mobility of the CP domain, with the possibility to hinge on strands b1 and b4, towards the catalytic center. Actually, conformational changes accompanying each step of the methionine activation reaction, as well as complex formation with tRNAMet, are indicated by large speci®c variations of the EcMetRS tryptophan ¯uorescence (Blanquet et al., 1972, 1973, 1975). Comparison of the catalytic domains of class1 aaRS The CP domain of TtIleRS (Nureki et al., 1998) is larger than that of MetRS. Nevertheless, in the two enzyme structures, the a2, a3, and a4 helices as well as the b1, b4, b5 and b6 strands have the same organisation (Figure 4). Relatively to the Rossmann fold, the zinc-binding module in the two MetRS species occupies the same position as the IleRS region that is responsible for the hydrolysis of misactivated Val-AMP or misacylated ValtRNAIle (Lin et al., 1996; Nureki et al., 1998). This correspondence is evocative of an involvement of the zinc knuckle of MetRS in some proof-reading reaction. However, an editing of a misacylated tRNAMet by MetRS was never evidenced. Instead, ef®cient editing of misactivated homocysteine through cyclization of its adenylate to form homo-

cysteine thiolactone has been reported (Jakubowski & Fersht, 1981). Whether the CP domain of MetRS participates in this cyclization reaction remains an open question. Figure 4 compares the two class 1a MetRS and IleRS (Nureki et al., 1998) to TyrRS (Brick et al., 1989), GlnRS (Rould et al., 1989) and GluRS (Nureki et al., 1995). Although the CP domain varies considerably from one 3D structure to another, some resemblances are worth noting. Clearly, the a2 helix and the anti-parallel b-sheet present in MetRS and IleRS are conserved in GluRS and GlnRS. They can be found also in ArgRS (Cavarelli et al., 1998). In addition, GlnRS and GluRS possess an extension of the CP beta-sheet. In the case of

GlnRS, this extension is involved in tRNA binding (Rould et al., 1989). Finally, in place of the a3 and a4 helices found in the class 1a enzymes, GluRS possesses two antiparallel b-strands that are anchored to the bE strand of the Rossmann fold. A conserved sequence with a consensus WDISR is found in MetRS, IleRS, LeuRS and ValRS, which are hydrophobic amino acid-speci®c aaRS. This sequence is part of the b5 strand, within the CP. The remaining class 1 enzymes, ArgRS, GluRS, GlnRS, TyrRS and TrpRS, lack the motif. It is unclear whether a sequence corresponding to WDISR occurs in CysRS, which possesses a short CP (Eriani et al., 1991). EcMetRS variants into which R233, belonging to the WDISR sequence,

was changed into A or Q are markedly affected in both the Km of methionine and the kcat of the activation step (Kim et al., 1993a). Considering the large distance between this residue and the catalytic center, these observations may re¯ect the occurrence of cross-talks between distant domains through structural rearrangements throughout the course of the enzymatic reaction. Recently, on the basis of the structure of IleRS from Staphylococcus aureus complexed with tRNAIle, the arginine residue of the WCISR motif of IleRS was proposed to play a role in the binding of C75 of tRNA (Silvian et al., 1999). In addition to the CP domain, the Rossmann folds of class 1 aaRS contain insertions (pink in Figure 4) speci®c for each enzyme. In MetRS, these insertions consist of the a1 and a5 helices. Helix a1 is inserted between bB and aB. In ArgRS, a fourhelix insertion termed Ins-1 is located at the same position. It is thought to be involved in the binding of the acceptor stem of tRNA (Cavarelli et al., 1998). A possible role of the a1 helix of MetRS in tRNA binding was suggested by af®nity labeling experiments (Hountondji et al., 1985, 1990). Using a tRNAMet oxidized at its 3H adenosine residue, two f residues could be labeled: K335, the second lysine residue in KMSKS and, to a lesser extent, K61, which belongs to a1 . When a truncated oxidized tRNA-CC lacking A76 was used as af®nity labeler,

K61 became the main targeted residue. Finally, with tRNA-C, residues K142, K147 and K149, all of which belong to the zinc-binding domain, were cross-linked. By using the recently determined structure of the IleRS:tRNAIle complex (Silvian et al., 1999), we attempted a positioning of tRNA on EcMetRS. After superimposition of the Rossmann folds of the two enzymes, we noted that the position of the acceptor helix of IleRS-bound tRNAIle satis®ed all the above af®nity labeling data (results not shown). We may propose that both a1 and the CP domain of MetRS force the acceptor arm of tRNA towards the active center in a manner similar to that observed in the case of IleRS. It was previously noticed that two peptidic regions centered around residues 253 and 300 of EcMetRS were broadly conserved in the available MetRS sequences. The corresponding residues were proposed to be involved in methionine binding (Fourmy et al., 1991; Mechulam et al., 1991; Schmitt et al., 1997). In agreement with this hypothesis, mutations directed towards H301 and W305 of EcMetRS strongly affected the af®nity of the methionine substrate (Fourmy et al., 1991; Ghosh et al., 1991b). In the present structure of MetRS, these two regions belong to the aC and aD helices, and face one another to form a hydrophobic cleft. Since TyrRS displays its L-tyrosine binding site at

Structure of E. coli Methionyl-tRNA Synthetase

the same position in the Rossmann fold (Brick & Blow, 1987), the cavity of MetRS can be safely considered to be the site of the L-methionine substrate. tRNA anticodon-binding site Previous studies using either af®nity labeling (Leon & Schulman, 1987), site-directed mutagenesis or genetic selection (Ghosh et al., 1990, 1991a; Meinnel et al., 1991; Schmitt et al., 1993) showed that two peptidic regions in the C-terminal part of EcMetRS were involved in anticodon binding. These two regions carry residues W461, N452, R395 and N391, which are positively involved in the recognition of the CAU anticodon, as well as two acidic residues, D449 and D456, which are involved in the rejection of tRNAs carrying a nonCAU anticodon. Indeed, mutation of either D449 or D456 into a non-acidic residue enabled recognition by MetRS of mutant tRNAMet having a nonCAU anticodon, while keeping intact the capacity to bind authentic tRNAMet (Schmitt et al., 1993). The present sequence assignement in the structural elements of the C-terminal domain of MetRS signi®cantly differs from that in the previously published structure (Brunie et al., 1990). Here, all the above residues are carried by two parallel a-helices (a9 and a11) inside a helix bundle domain closely resembling the anticodon-binding domain of ArgRS (Cavarelli et al., 1998) or IleRS (Auld & Schimmel, 1996; Nureki et al., 1998). The two helices interact through a network of electrostatic bonds (Figure 5). Notably, R395, a positive determinant for anticodon recognition, interacts with the negative determinant D456. In addition, the second negative determinant, D449, binds the sidechain of K388. Such a positioning of K388 suggests a role for this residue in the recognition of the anticodon. Upon mutation of D449 or of D456, disruption of the network of electrostatic bonds would increase mobility of the involved residues, thus conferring an enlarged speci®city to the synthetase. The a9 helix, to which the positive determinant R395 belongs, extends a helix (a8) connecting the C-terminal domain to the KMSKS domain. This organization possibly re¯ects a relation between the anticodon-binding domain and the active center of MetRS, as suggested by Gale et al. (1996). Similar links between equivalent domains have been noticed in GlnRS and ArgRS (Rould et al., 1989; Cavarelli et al., 1998). In the case of GlnRS, this connection was hypothesized to trigger glutamine activation in response to tRNA binding (Perona et al., 1993). In contrast to GlnRS and ArgRS, MetRS does not require tRNA binding for amino acid activation. However, a link between tRNAMet binding and the conformation of the KMSKS region might favor the ef®ciency of the reaction of transfer of the amino acid. In the cases of both MetRS and TyrRS, evidences were obtained that the KMSKS loop ¯ips upon amino acid activation (First & Fersht, 1993; Schmitt et al., 1994)

and reaches a closed conformation after aminoacyl adenylate formation (Brick et al., 1989). One may imagine that, through the a8a9 link, the binding of tRNAMet at the anticodon-binding domain facilitates the access of the accepting 3H -terminal adenosine residue to the active site, by opening of the KMSKS loop. Several studies indicate that a15 serves as a relay between the anticodon-binding and the KMSKS domains (Mellot et al., 1989; Kim et al., 1993b; Gale et al., 1996). In particular, mutation of R533, a residue located immediately before a15, changes the af®nity of an isolated anticodon stem and loop of Ê tRNAMet (Gale et al., 1996). R533 is 22 A away f from W461. Such a location enables contacts with the top of the anticodon stem or with the D-stem of tRNA. However, mutation of R533 also affects the rate of aminoacylation of tRNAMet (Kim et al., f 1993b) as well as the binding of an acceptor helix based on the same tRNA (Gale et al., 1996). This behavior indicates that upon interaction of R533 with tRNA, productive binding of the acceptor stem inside the KMSKS and CP regions is improved. Finally, the CP domain of MetRS makes contacts with both the Rossmann fold and the KMSKS domains. The side-chain of Q211 is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain oxygen atom and NH group of V322 (bE) and the side-chain of Q213 binds the main-chain NH group of I367 (loop before b8). These two Q residues lie between the

1294 long a3 and a4 helices. Such contacts seem important to sustain the aminoacylation reaction. Indeed, it was observed that the Q211R or the Q213P mutations changed the rate of tRNAMet aminoacylation (Meinnel et al., 1991). Such connections between structure and function provide useful clues to the way in which the different modules of MetRS may communicate to achieve their role in a co-ordinated manner. To model the motions of the synthetase modules and reach a dynamical description of the enzyme speci®city, more structural studies involving ligandcomplexed forms of the protein are clearly necessary. The availability of the 3D structure of free MetRS, as reported here, should contribute to promote such efforts.

For the preparation of heavy-atom derivatives, crystals were ®rst transferred in 3.2 M ammonium sulfate plus 20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.0). Samarium, platinum and uranyl derivatives were prepared as described (Zelwer et al., 1982). Native data were collected from crystals soaked in ammonium sulfate and used as a reference for MIR phasing. Data were collected at 4  C by using a synchrotron source Ê (l  0.9 A) at the L.U.R.E. (Orsay, France) (Table 1). Diffraction images were analyzed either with the MOSFLM program (A.G.W. Leslie, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Daresbury, UK) and the data further processed using programs from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project No 4, 1994). Phase determination and model building The positions of the heavy atoms in the derivatives were found identical with those identi®ed for EcMetRS crystals (Zelwer et al., 1982). After re®nement of the heavy-atom parameters using the CCP4 program MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991), MIR phases were calculated and the corresponding electron density modi®ed by solvent ¯attening and histogram matching using the DM program (Cowtan, 1994). Electron density maps Ê were calculated at 3.5 and 3.0 A resolution. An initial polyalanine model containing 90 % of the residues was then constructed using the O program (Jones et al., 1991). In this procedure, the re®ned model of TtMetRS was used as a guide. Refinement Ê The model was ®rst re®ned against the 8.0 to 4.0 A native sulfate data using the program X-PLOR 3.851 (Brunger et al., 1987). The crystallographic R-factor of the starting model was 45 %. A random sample containing 8 % of the total data was excluded from the re®nement and the agreement between the calculated and observed structure factors corresponding to these re¯ections (Rfree) was used to monitor the course of the re®nement procedure (Brunger, 1992). Several rounds of positional re®nement and simulated annealing, alternated with manual model rebuilding, were performed. After a few runs, bulk solvent was modeled, which allowed the use Ê of data up to 20 A resolution. Resolution was then

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection The M551 monomeric form of E. coli MetRS composed of the 551 N-terminal residues of the native enzyme (Mellot et al., 1989) was used instead of the truncated monomeric form of MetRS obtained by limited trypsinolysis (Cassio & Waller, 1971). The pBSM551 plasmid encoding the M551 enzyme was derived from pBSM547 (Fourmy et al., 1991) by replacing the PstI-BamHI fragment by the corresponding one from M13M551 (Mellot et al., 1989), which contains an opal stop codon following the codon for Lys551. The M551 enzyme was puri®ed from JM101Tr-pBSM551 cells as described for the M547 form (Fourmy et al., 1991). Small crystals of M551 were obtained by slow dialysis of a 6 mg/ml protein solution against 1.3 M ammonium citrate plus 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), as described in the case of the trypsic form of MetRS (Waller et al., 1971). These crystals were used to seed pre-equilibrated sitting drops (100 ml) containing 3.6 mg/ml M551 enzyme in 1.08 M ammonium citrate plus 30 mM potassium phosphate and 4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.0). Crystals obtained using these conditions were monoclinic, space group Ê Ê P21, with unit cell dimensions a  78.15 A, b  46.3 A, Ê c  87.7 A, b  109.06  . For data collection, crystals were stabilised in 1.5 M ammonium citrate plus 30 mM pot-
