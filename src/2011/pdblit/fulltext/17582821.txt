Structural Ramification for Acetyl-Lysine Recognition by the Bromodomain of Human BRG1 Protein, a Central ATPase of the SWI/SNF Remodeling Complex
Mahavir Singh, Grzegorz M. Popowicz, Marcin Krajewski, and Tad A. Holak*

Figure S1. Positions of highly conserved amino acids in the BRG1 bromodomain. Conserved residues are shown in red and marked. A) A front stereo view of the structure with the conserved residues marked. The circle shows the acetyl-lysine binding site in the structure. B) A 90° flip of the front view.

Figure S2. Position of the N-acetylated K16 H4 peptide in comparison with bromodomain residues involved in keeping it in a proper orientation. Dotted lines in black with arrows show the approximate distances between the two residues. The dotted lines in red represent the hydrogen bond. A) Positions of Glu360, Tyr413 and Asn407 in comparison with the N-acetylated H4 peptide in the yGCN bromodomain. B) Positions of Glu1493, Tyr1547, Ile1546, and Asn1540 in com parison with the modeled N-acetylated H4 peptide from H4 peptide in the BRG1 bromodomain.
