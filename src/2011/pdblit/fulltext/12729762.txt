Abstract

The homodimeric flavoenzyme glutathione reductase (GR) which catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide is a cornerstone of the malaria parasite antioxidant defense and repair mechanisms. Here we report on the identification of the GR gene from Plasmodium falciparum. A 1.4kb fragment of the gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using this PCR fragment as a probe a full length cDNA clone (2085 bp) was isolated from a P. falciparum gametocyte library. The deduced amino acid sequence of 541 residues shows an overall identity of 35% when compared to the human enzyme. Most amino acids of known function are identical. However, notable differences between human and parasite protein occur in the glutathione-binding pocket (for instance, Glu374 instead of the expected basic residue) and at the intersubunit contact area. These regions are of particular interest since they represent binding sites of known GR inhibitors. Consequently, parasite GR can serve as a target structure for the design of antimalarial drugs.

global burden of parasitic diseases and menaces 40% of the world population [l]. Due to the high mutational rate of the parasite and the resulting rapid adaptation to environmental changes, drug resistance and geographic distribution of the disease are increasing. As experimenta naturae innate protective mechanisms against malaria have evolved [2,3]. These red blood cell disorders which often represent severe illnesses for homozygous and hemizygous individuals include a variety of hemoglobinopathies [4,5], as well as glucosedphosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [6,7].

terestingly, all these conditions have one metabolic key in common: the exposure of P. falciparum in erythrocytes to the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species [8,9]. This oxidative stress [lo] does not only originate from the host. The parasite itself produces hydrogen peroxide while digesting red cell oxyhemoglobin Ill]. Challenging the host cell up to a tolerable degree with oxygen derivatives appears to promote growth and differentiation of P. falciparum [ 12,131. However, pronounced disturbance of the equilibrium between oxidative challenge and antioxidant capacity results in irrevocable parasite damage. The central enzyme of antioxidative defense is glutathione reductase (GR) which provides high intracellular concentrations of the reducing tripeptide glutathione by catalyzing the reaction GSSG + NADPH + H+ - 2 GSH + NADP+ [14,15]. Three-dimensional structure and mechanism of catalysis have been established for human GR (hGR) in atomic detail [ 16,171. In order to create a pharmacological phenocopy of inherited GRdeficiency, this enzyme was chosen as a drug target and the antimalarial activity of a number of GR inhibitors has already been established [14]. Here we report on the identification and sequence analysis of the P. falciparum GR gene. The deduced protein structure of PfGR is discussed and compared to the geometry of hGR, the corresponding enzyme of the human host cell. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Parasites and preparation of genomic DNA P. falciparum FCH-5 was cultured and isolated as described previously [ 181.Genomic DNA of the parasites was prepared using the Stratagene DNA Extraction Kit according to the manfacturer's instructions.
2.2. Polymerase chain reaction

antisense oligonucleotide 5'-AA(C/T)TC(C/T)TC(A/T/G/C)GCIGCI(G/C)(A/T)IGG(A/G)TG (A/T/G) AT-3'. The oligonucleotides had been designed on the basis of amino acid sequences conserved in glutathione reductases of other organisms. These sequences are available from the EMBL data library which up to now contains GR sequences from 13 species, including
Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Pisum sativum and Mus musculus. In order to reduce the complexity of the

oligonucleotide populations, inosine was introduced in some positions instead of all four nucleotides. A 1.4-kb genomic DNA fragment was amplified by 30 PCR cycles of 95" for 2 min, 50°C for 1.5 min, and 72°C for 2 min [19]. One to 10 ~1 of the amplified DNA was used in a second round of amplification. The products were analysed on 1% TAE (40 mM Tris-acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) agarose gels, purified (Geneclean 11, Bio 101 Inc.) and subcloned into the pCRIITM cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Both strands of the PCR fragment were analysed performing the Sanger dideoxy-chain termination reaction for double stranded DNA [20]. 2.3. cDNA clones Using the 1.4-kb PCR fragment as a probe, a number of cDNA clones were isolated from a gametocyte cDNA library kindly provided by David Kaslow, Bethesda, Maryland; this cDNA plasmid library was screened by standard colony hybridization techniques [20]. Both strands of the isolated cDNA clones were sequenced [20]. One of the clones contained the complete coding region of PfGR and 5'- and 3 `-nontranslated regions. 2.4. Numbering system for parison of PfGR and hGR

In order to amplify and isolate the desired fragment of the GR gene from P. falciparum, 100 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the degenerate sense oligonucleotide 5'-AT(A/T/C)GG(AiT/C)G(G/C)(A/T/C)GGI(A/T)(G/C) IGGIGG 3 ' and the degenerate

It contains the FADbinding domain (residues 18- 157 in hGR; 39- 193 in PfGR), the NADPH-binding domain (158-293 in hGR; 194-318 in PfGR), the central domain (294-364 in hGR; 3 19-390 in PfGR), and the sub-

3. Results and discussion
3.1.

Isolation and analysis of DNA encoding Plasmodium falciparum glutathione reductase
In

falciparum,

order to amplify genomic DNA from P. oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved peptides of heterologous glutathione reductases were designed. A number of PCR products with the expected size were obtained; the largest fragment contained 1.4 kb. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed two characteristics of a P. falciparum gene [24,25]: a high proportion of A and T and a typical codon usage. When used as a probe to screen a cDNA library one clone (PfGR13.4) of 2085 bp, containing the complete coding region, the 3 `nontranslated region, and part of the 5'-nontranslated region was identified. In the overlapping section, the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone was identical with the genomic 1.4-kb PCR product. The 3'-nontranslated region contains the consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) at position 1901- 1906. The P. falciparum 1.4-kb PCR fragment hybridized specifically with parasite DNA while there was no signal with the DNA of the human host (data not shown). 3.2. The structure of P. falciparum glutathione reductase is likely to be less compact than the host cell enzyme The cDNA clone PfGR13.4 was found to encode the characteristic four-domain structure of glutathione reductases which was originally

discovered in the human erythrocyte enzyme [23,26]. The N- and C-terminal extensions attached to the rigid four-domain structure are not essential for catalysis and vary a lot among species. Here we compare the common core structure of parasite GR (residues 39-520) and host erythrocyte GR (residues 18-478). The computer-based alignment [27] of PfGR with human GR was corrected on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of hGR [ 17,281. Large sections of PfGR can be assigned unambiguously and most residues of known function are present in sequence motifs of PfGR. Helices and sheet strands appear also to be highly conserved (Figs. 1 and 2) except for the two B-meanders. As shown in the alignment, PfGR has an insertion of five amino acids in the region of the first p-meander which is formed in hGR by residues 128-148, and it lacks 11 residues (possibly the segment 269-279 of hGR) in the region corresponding to the second &meander. Another extra segment of nine residues in PfGR is located between Lys53 and Leu54 of hGR. This insertion is also present in GRs from plants which might be used as supporting evidence for the notion that P. falciparum has a `green' origin [29,30]. The largest insertion in PfGR (15 residues close to position 413 of hGR) is part of a loop connecting two P-strands of the Greek key motif in the interface domain. Finally, there are nine single insertions or deletions in PfGR, none of them interfering with secondary structures. In balance, when comparing the common core structure of the two enzymes, the sequence of PfGR is approximately 20 residues longer than human GR, i.e., PfGR appears to be less compact. It should be emphasized that the precise position of insertions and deletions of PfGR cannot be assigned without solving the crystal structure of this enzyme since they are located in chain regions with little

(a) The four structural domains are shown in different colours: blue, FADdomain (amino acids 18- 157); red, NADPH-domain (I 58-293); yellow, central domain (294-364); green, interface domain (365-478). (b) In the ribbon model, the similarity of hGR to PfGR along the chain is graded using the following colour code: white, 75-100% identity; pink, 50-75% identity; magenta, 20-50% identity; blue, O-20% identity. Additionally shown are FAD (yellow), GSSG (red), and the rigidly bound moiety of NADPH (green).

resemblance between hGR and PfGR; as examplified for the insertion(s) in the first o-meander of trypanothione reductase, computer-based alignments can be grossly misleading [3l]. Many surface loops - for instance in the segments 151-181,289-306 or 432-457 - are so different for parasite GR and host GR that these peptides can serve as discriminating antigens for immunohistochemical studies on the parasite enzyme. 3.3. Catalytic site residues and jlavin-tuning structures are well conserved 3.3. I. Catalytic site residues. The conspicuous

The structural and functional intimacy of FAD domain and central domain has led some authors to regard these structures as a single domain [16,28]. 3.4. Marked differences between host and parasite Both PfGR and hGR contain variations of the canonic dinucleotide-binding motif Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly. In the NADPH domain of hGR the last Gly is replaced by an alanine (Alal99), and PfGR has in addition Ser231 instead of the central Gly. A serine at an equivalent position occurs also in NADH peroxidase, an enzyme of known geometric structure [32,37]. The residues representing the induced fit on nicotinamide binding to GR are conserved in PfGR (Tyr232 and Thr395). The primary purpose of the strained and lid-like conformation of this tyrosine in the absence of NADPH appears to be the protection of the isoalloxazine ring from molecular oxygen and reactive oxygen species [38]. The two side chains responsible for favouring binding of NADPH and discriminating against NADH [21,39] are Arg253 and Arg258 in PfGR. 3.4.2. GSSG-binding. As revealed in the high resolution structure of hGR, the binding of GSSG involves 10 direct and 14 water-mediated contacts between protein and substrate [39]. With respect to the side chains making direct contact Lys58 (Arg37 in hGR), Tyr145, His509', and Glu514' are conserved. A conspicuous difference is position 374 which contains a Glu residue instead of the expected basic side chain: Arg347 in hGR is required for fixing the ar-carboxylate of the central glutathione moiety. In the aligned sequences of four plant GRs and Pseudomonas aeroginosa GR, the position equivalent to 374 is neither Arg nor Lys. It should be noted that the six known GR sequences without a basic residue in position 374 possess an Arg or Lys in position 378, that is on the same side of the helix. This finding suggests that the binding mode for GSSG is different in PfGR so that glutathione derivatives can be considered as potential inhibitors of PfGR. 3.4.3. Intersubunit contact areas. In hGR there are two interfaces between the two subunits [171. The lower or looser contact area of 1200 A * conenzyme occur at the ligand-binding site 3.4.1. NADPH-binding and induced fit.

catalytic site residues of the hGR structure have identical counterparts in PfGR: Cys88, Cys93, Lys96, Tyr232, Glu236, His509' and Glu514'. It should be noted that the sequence around the active site thiols (positions 55-67 in hGR) is identical in host and parasite enzyme. This sequence is also highly conserved in a number of different disulfide reductases, in NADH peroxidase, mercuric ion reductases and other flavoproteins of this family [15,32]. 3.3.2. FAD-binding. The two known fingerprint motifs of FAD-binding [33,34] are present both in PfGR and hGR. These regions are the general dinucleotide-binding motif Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly (residues 27-32 in hGR; 48-53 in PfGR) and the special FAD-binding motif Thr-X-X-X-X-h-y-hh-Gly-Asp (see 347-357 in PfGR and 321-331 in hGR) [35]; h represents a non-polar residue and y any aromatic side chain. The carboxylate of the terminal Asp forms a hydrogen bond to the ribityl moiety of FAD. Both in PfGR and in hGR there are three internal salt bridges juxtaposed to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD: Lys96lGlu236, Arg316lAsp357 and His509'/Glu514' in PfGR, the corresponding positions held by identical amino acids in hGR being 66/201,291/33 1 and 467'1472'. In each case the basic amino acid is closer to the tricycfic ring so that the tlavin's electrophilicity can be finely tuned during the catalytic cycle. In this context the helix 366-378 (339-351 in hGR) is also of interest. The positive end of the helix dipole seems to be necessary for stabilizing a negative charge occurring transiently at 02~ or N3 of the isoalloxazine during the transfer of reducing equivalents [ 15,361.

tains the intersubunit bridge connecting CyBO and Cys90'. This disulfide is not present in PfGR and most other GR sequences. The upper tightly packed contact area of 2100 A2 is represented by the interlocking parallel helices 440-452 and 440' 452 ' (482-494 and 482 ' - 494' in PfGR). Its importance for the structure and function of hGR is illustrated by the fact that a single mutation at residue 446 (and 446') leads to a completely unfolded monomeric protein [40]. Twenty out of 43 residues at the upper part of the interface are identical in host and parasite enzyme including Glu442 of hGR (Glu484 in PfGR), Gln445 (Gln487), Gly446 (Gly488), Asn462 (Asn504) and Pro468 (ProSlO). A similar proportion, i.e., less than 50% identity is obtained when comparing soybean GR or spinach GR to hGR. In contrast, as many as 39 out of 43, that is 92%, of the upper interface residues of hGR are conserved in E. coli [ 17,431. These data suggest that the design of dimerization inhibitors might be feasible to specifically inactivate the PfGR, since the catalytic site geometry requires amino acid residues from both subunits. In conclusion, the comparison of P. falciparum GR and the isofunctional host enzyme opens a new approach to studies on the redox metabolism, growth and differentiation of the parasites and to chemotherapeutic interventions against malaria.

Note added in proof According to a recent report (Gasdaska et al. (1995), FEBS Lett. 373, 5-9), putative glutathione reductase genes of various eukaryotes may actually encode a thioredoxin reductase-like protein, that is, an enzyme with a rather broad substrate specificity.
