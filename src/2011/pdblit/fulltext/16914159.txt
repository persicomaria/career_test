Summary

In an attempt to identify improved biochemical markers for the diagnosis of early kidney damage via urinary analysis of kidney derived enzymes, we have undertaken the systematic identification, quantification and characterization (following purification via anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, and preparative electrophoresis) of the dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases in normal human kidney soluble extract (with which the majority of the cellular activity of these enzymes is associated). Four chromatographically separable enzyme types were identified as follows (% relative activity in parentheses): dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I (EC 3.4.14.1; 24%); dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II (EC 3.4.14.2; 8%); dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5; 61%); tripeptidyl aminopeptidase (unclassified; 7%). Comparison of the levels of activity for the above enzyme types in normal and pathological urine may lead to an improvement upon existing procedures for the early detection of renal damage.

Introduction

The kidney has considerable functional reserve; thus methods based upon measurement of renal function routinely used in the diagnosis of kidney disease lack the sensitivity required for early detection of kidney damage. In an attempt to develop improved biochemical markers for the diagnosis of early kidney damage via urinary analysis of kidney-derived enzymes, we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the peptide-degrading cytosolic exopeptidases (aminopeptidases,

dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases) of normal human kidney, since previous studies have suggested that measurement of urinary levels of the brush border membrane associated enzyme alanyl aminopeptidase is a sensitive index of cellular damage in patients with kidney disease [I] or drug induced nephrotoxicity [2]. We have previously described the identification and characterization of the aminopeptidases in human kidney soluble extract [3]; in this paper we describe the identification, quantification and characterization (following purification) of the dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases in human kidney cytosol using a similar experimental approach. Previous work described in the literature on the characterization of dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases (including the enzyme-types described in this paper) in human and animal tissues has been detailed in the bibliography of exopeptidases by McDonald and Barrett [4]. Materials and methods

DEAE-Sephadex A50 and Sephacryl S-200 and S-300 were obtained from Pharmacia, London, UK; aminoacyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) derivatives from Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland and Cambridge Biochemicals, Cambridge, UK; all other materials were obtained from Sigma, London, UK and BDH, Poole, UK and were of analytical grade where available. Enzyme extraction

Approximately 6 g of normal human kidney (representative of the whole of the kidney thickness, and from cases with no history of renal disease), obtained at autopsy within 15 h of death, were homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (2 x 30 s at 15 000 rev/mm, with cooling in ice). A 1 : 4 tissue : buffer homogenate was prepared in 50 mmol/l glycylglycine buffer, pH 7.5, at 6" C containing 5 mmol/l EGTA, 1 mmol/l 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol and 3 mmol/l NaN, (Buffer A). The homogenate was centrifuged at approximately 20000 X g for 30 min and the supernatant retained for enzyme separation. Separation of dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases raphy of kidney supernatant by anion exchange chromatog-

Approximately 20 ml of supernatant (NaCl cone adjusted to 0.1 mol/l) were applied to a column (30 X 1.5 cm) of DEAE Sephadex A50 anion exchange gel equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 mol/l NaCl, and then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1-0.5 mol/l NaCl, total vol. 500 ml) in buffer A at a flow rate of 10 ml/h; fractions (2 ml) were collected for activity assays.

purified via gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 (protein exclusion limit 250 kDa) or Sephacryl S-300 (protein exclusion limit lo6 Da), following concentration by ultrafiltration (Amicon cell, 10 kDa molecular mass exclusion membrane). Samples were applied to a gel column (88 X 1.5 cm) equilibrated with 50 mmol/l Tris/acetate buffer, pH 7.5, at 6'C containing 0.1 mol/l KCl, 1 mmol/l 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol and 3 mmol/l NaN, at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Cytochrome c, myoglobin, creatine kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase and ferritin were used as molecular mass calibration proteins, and the void volume of the column determined with dextran blue. Fraction volumes (approximately 2 ml) were determined by weight. Preparative po/yactyfamide gei electrophoresis Following anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, each enzyme type was further purified using preparative polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis (14 x 10 cm, acrylamide cone ranging from 4% to 7% depending on the particular enzyme under purification) with a continuous Tris/acetate buffer system (0.1 mol/l, pH 8, at 6°C). Enzyme samples were concentrated to a volume of approximately 1 ml (Amicon 10 ml ultrafiltration cell with 10 kDa exclusion membrane) and layered across the full width of the gel slab, following addition of glycerol (30% v/v) and bromophenol blue tracking dye (0.10%). Samples were run at 20 mA/gel slab for 20 h (equivalent to approximately 3 x tracking dye migration distance). Gel strips 1 cm in width were removed vertically from each gel slab and stained for protein following the method of Oakley et al. [5]; the gel slabs were then sectioned horizontally (3 mm slices) and enzyme extracted by soaking the slices in assay buffer for 20 h at 6 o C. For each of the enzyme types investigated, a single protein staining band coinciding with enzyme activity was obtained following the above procedure. Assay of dipeptidyi and tripeptidyl aminopeptidase activity Enzyme (0.1 ml) was incubated with the approp~ate assay medium (total volume 0.3 ml) for 1 h at 37" C, and the reaction terminated by addition of 0.6 ml of ethanol. The fluorescence of the liberated AMC was measured by reference to a fluorescence standard block (tetraphenylbutadiene; h,, 380 nm, h,, 440 nm). Assay blanks were run in which the enzyme was added to the medium immediately before addition of ethanol. Assay conditions were modified (reduced enzyme volume and/or incubation time) for samples with high enzyme activity such that the extent of substrate utilization never exceeded 15%. Assays were carried out using the follotiing arninoacyl-AMC derivatives, with the appropriate optimal experimental (obtained by substitution of buffers, effecters and substrates in the above assay procedure) given in parentheses: dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I (50 mmol/l acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 *C, 1 mmol/l di~iothreitol, 0.5 mmol/l gly-arg-AMC); dipeptidyl a~nopeptidase II (50 mmol/l acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 37°C. 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 0.25 mmol/l lys-ala-AMC); dipeptidyl

a~nopeptida~ III [50 mmol/l glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 9.0, at 37' C, 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmol/l arg-arg-AMC]; dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV [50 mmol/l Tris/acetate buffer pH 8.0 at 37' C, 1 rnmol/l dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmol/l gly-proAMC]; tripeptidyl aminopeptidase [50 mmol/l Tris/acetate, pH 7.5, at 37OC, 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 0.25 mmol/l ala-ala-phe-AMC]. For each of the enzyme types described above, the relative rates of hydrolysis were determined (under the appropriate assay conditions) for the following AMC derivatives: ala-, arg-, glu-, gly-, leu-, lys-, met-, orn-, phe-, pro-, ser-, tyr-, val-, arg-arg-, glu-phe, gly-arg-, gly-pro-, lys-ala-, phe-pro-, CBZ-gly-pro-, ala-ala-phe-, Ac-ala-ala-tyr-, glu-gly-glyphe-. The activities of dipeptidyl aminopeptidases I, II and IV and tripeptidyl aminopeptidase were estimated directly in kidney homogenate following incorporation of

bestatin (0.01 mg/ml) in the appropriate assay media; the latter compound is an inhibitor of the major soluble kidney exopeptidase, alanyl aminopeptidase [3], which interferes in assays for the above enzymes via hydrolysis of gly-arg-AMC, lys-alaAMC, gly-pro-AMC and ala-ala-phe-AMC, respectively (Fig. 1). Assay of the above enzymes in the insoluble fraction obtained after centrifugation of kidney homogenate was carried out following reconstitution of the former in extraction Buffer A containing 0.1% (v/v) nonidet nonionic detergent. Results and discussion Four dipeptidyl aminopeptidase enzyme types (I, II, III and IV) and two forms of tripeptidyl aminopeptidase have been previously described in a variety of species and/or tissues [4]. Extrapolation of such data for individual enzymes to human kidney is difficult, because of the varying experimental approach employed by different research groups; there has been no systematic investigation to identify, quantify and characterize the above enzymes in human kidney tissue, prior to their measurement in normal and pathological urine samples as indicators of renal damage. A preliminary survey of kidney homogenate and soluble extract (as described under `Methods') showed that for each of the enzyme types investigated, at least 75% of the activity measured in homogenate was present in the soluble fraction. This result was unexpected for the case of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV, which has been considered to be a membrane associated enzyme [4]. However, data obtained for the characterization of dipeptidyl arninopeptidase IV from human brain [6] and skeletal muscle (D. Mantle, unpublished work) tissues using a similar experimental approach have suggested that this enzyme is also present in the latter tissues in soluble form. Because of the problem of interference in the respective assay procedures for the dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases (principally by alanyl aminopeptidase, see Fig. l), a chromatographic fractionation step is required before the accurate identification and quantification of these enzyme types is possible. The results of a typical separation of dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases following anion exchange chromatography of human kidney soluble extract are shown in Fig. 1; four chromatographically separable enzyme types were identified as follows: dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV and tripeptidyl aminopeptidase. The further purification and characterization of each of these enzymes is described below. The relative activity (following anion exchange fractionation) for each enzyme type is given in Table I. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I eluted from the anion exchange column at a NaCl cone of 0.1 mol/l (Fig. la). The enzyme was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6% separating gel) as described under `Methods'. Optimum activity was obtained at pH 6.0 (50% relative activity at pH 4.0 and 7.5, respectively) in the presence of 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol. There was no increase in activity on addition of the following divalent cations (0.055 mmol/l): Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2', Mn2+, ZnZt; addition of Co2+, Cu*+, Cd2+ and Hg2+ (0.05-5 mmol/l) resulted in

inhibition of activity. Only the gly-arg-AMC derivative was appreciably hydrolysed (Km = 0.5 mmol/l). Approximately 50% inhibition of activity was obtained with the following inhibitors: leupeptin (0.1 mg/ml), p-hydroxymercuriphenyl sulphonate (0.5 mmol/l), N-ethyl maleimide (0.5 mmol/l). No inhibition of activity was obtained following addition of soyabean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml), EDTA (10 mmol/l), pepstatin (0.1 mg/ml), puromycin (0.5 mmol/l) or bestatin (0.1 mg/ml). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated as 210 kDa. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II eluted from the anion exchange column at a NaCl cont. of 0.1 mol/l (Fig. lb), and was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% separating gel) as described under `Methods'. Optimum activity was obtained at pH 5.5 (50% relative activity at pH 4 and pH 7, respectively) in the presence of 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol. There was no increase in activity following addition of Ca*+, addition of Co*`, Cu*+, Cd*+ and Mg*+, Sr2+ Ba* Mn*", Zn*+ (0.05-5 mmol/l); Hg*+ (0.5-5 mmol/l) resulted in inhibition of activity. Only the lys-ala-AMC (K, = 0.25 mmol/l) and phe-pro-AMC (80% relative hydrolysis rate) derivatives were appreciably hydrolysed. Approximately 50% inhibition of activity was obtained following addition of 2 mmol/l phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride; there was no inhibition of activity on addition of soyabean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml), EDTA, (10 mmol/l), pepstatin (0.1 mg/ml) or bestatin (0.1 mg/ml). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated as 150 kDa. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV activity eluted from the anion exchange column at a NaCl cont. of 0.24 mol/l (Fig. lc). The enzyme was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5% separating gel) as described under `Methods'. Optimum activity

was obtained at pH 8.0 (50% relative activity at pH 6.5 and 9.5, respectively) in the presence of 1 mmol/l dit~othreitol. There was no increase in activity following addition of Ca2+, Ba*+, Sr'+, Mg2+ (0.05-5 mmol/l); addition of CuZf, Cd'+, Cd2+, Hg2' or Zn'" (0.5-5 mmol/l) resulted in inhibition of activity. Only the gly-pro-AMC (K, = 0.4 mmol/l), phe-pro-AMC (80% relative hydrolysis rate) and ala-AMC (20% relative hydrolysis rate) derivatives were appreciably hydrolysed. Approximately 50% inhibition of activity was obtained on addition of p-hydroxymercuriphenyl sulphonate (0.1 mmol/l), N-ethyl maleimide (0.3 mmol/l), or puromycin (0.5 mmol/l). No inhibition of activity was obtained following addition of phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (2 mmol/l), soyabean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml), pepstatin (0.1 mg/ml), EDTA (10 mmol/l), bacitracin (0.1 mg/ml), bestatin (0.1 mg/ml), leupeptin (0.1 mg/ml) or chymostatin (0.1 mg/ml). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated as 260 kDa. Tripeptidyl aminopeptidase activity eluted from the anion exchange column at a NaCl cone of 0.31 mmol/l (Fig. Id), and was further purified via gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4% separating gel) as described under `Methods'. Optimum activity was obtained at pH 7.5 (50% relative activity at pH 6 and 9, respectively) in the presence of 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol. There was no increase in activity following addition of Ca2+, Mg 2+ Sr2+, Ba2+, Mn" (0.05-5 mmol/l); inhibition of activity resulted on addition of `Cur' , Cd2+, Hg'+ or Zn" (5 mmol/l). Only the ala-ala-phe-AMC derivative was appreciably hydrolysed (K, = 0.25 mmol/l). Approx. 50% inhibition of activity was obtained following addition of phenanthroline (0.05 mmol/l), ~-hydroxymercu~phenyl sulphonate (0.02 mmol/l), N-ethyl maleimide (0.1 mmol/l), puromycin (0.2 mmol/l) and bestatin (0.5 mg/ml). There was no inhibition of activity following addition of soyabean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml), leupeptin (0.1 mg/ml), chymostatin (0.1 mg/ml), pepstatin (0.1 mg/ml) or bestatin (0.1 mg/ml). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated as > 500 kDa. The characteristics of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV and tripeptidyl aminopeptidase purified from human kidney correspond closely with similar enzymes purified from human brain [6] and human skeletal muscle (D. Mantle, unpublished work) tissues, using a common experimental approach. In addition, the characteristics of the above enzymes purified from human kidney are broadly similar to corresponding enzymes characterised in a variety of animal tissues f4]_ No chromatograp~c~ly separable peak of activity corresponding to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase III was identified following anion exchange chromatography of kidney soluble extract, the apparent peak of activity with arg-arg-AMC substrate (Fig. le) eluting at 0.27 mol/l NaCl (molecular mass 103 kDa) being due to hydrolysis of the latter by alanyl aminopeptidase [3] (Fig. If). The peaks of apparent dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase II, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV and tripeptidyl aminopeptidase activity eluting from the anion exchange column gradient at 0.27 mol/l NaCl in Figs. la-ld respectively also result from the hydrolysis of gly-arg-, lys-ala-, gly-pro- and ala-ala-phe-AMC derivatives by alanyl aminopeptidase. It follows from the above data that an appreciable proportion of

142

apparent activity due to the above enzyme types measured in kidney homogenate or soluble extract, results from the action of alanyl aminopeptidase on their respective substrates. In summary, we have undertaken the characterization of the aminopeptidases 131, dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl aminopeptidases (described in this paper) in human kidney soluble extract using a systematic experimental approach. A total of eight chromatographically separable enzyme types have been identified, and their relative activities and characteristics (determined following purification as judged by polyacrylamide gel cl~trophoresis): alar@-, arginyl-, leucyl- and pyro~utamyl aminopeptidases; ~pcptidyl ~nop~tidases I, II and IV; and tripeptidyl ~nopeptidase. All of these enzyme types are potential urinary markers for the biochemical detection of kidney damage; further work will be required to determine the levels of activity of these enzymes in urine from normal control patients, and patients with early and end stage renal disease.
