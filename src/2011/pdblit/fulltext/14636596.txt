Abstract The M.FokI adenine-N6 DNA methyltransferase recognizes the asymmetric DNA sequence GGATG/CATCC. It consists of two domains each containing all motifs characteristic for adenine-N6 DNA methyltransferases. We have studied the specificity of DNA-methylation by both domains using 27 hemimethylated oligonucleotide substrates containing recognition sites which differ in one or two base pairs from GGATG or CATCC. The N-terminal domain of M.FokI interacts very specifically with GGATG-sequences, because only one of the altered sites is modified. In contrast, the C-terminal domain shows lower specificity. It prefers CATCC-sequences but only two of the 12 star sites (i.e. sites that differ in 1 bp from the recognition site) are not accepted and some star sites are modified with rates reduced only 2^3-fold. In addition, GGATGCand CGATGC-sites are modified which differ at two positions from CATCC. DNA binding experiments show that the Nterminal domain preferentially binds to hemimethylated GGATG/Cm ATCC sequences whereas the C-terminal domain binds to DNA with higher affinity but without specificity. Protein^protein interaction assays show that both domains of M.FokI are in contact with each other. However, several DNA-binding experiments demonstrate that DNA-binding of both domains is mutually exclusive in full-length M.FokI and both domains do not functionally influence each other. The implications of these results on the molecular evolution of type IIS restriction/modification systems are discussed. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In bacterial DNA, three types of methylated nucleotides are frequently found: 5-methylcytosine, 4methylcytosine and 6-methyladenine. These modi¢cations are introduced after DNA replication by DNA-methyltransferases (MTases) (reviews: [1^5]). Methylation of nucleobases is an important modi¢cation of the DNA which is involved in the control of DNA replication, gene expression, post-replicative repair, control of cell cycle and in restriction-modi¢-

cation systems (reviews: [1^6]). The important role of DNA methylation in bacteria is underscored by the recent ¢nding, that DNA MTases also are involved in pathogenicity of di¡erent human pathogens (Escherichia coli [7], Salmonella typhimurium [8,9], Neisseria meningitidis [10]). By far the most bacterial DNA MTases are components of restriction-modi¢cation systems (RM systems) which, as a kind of immune system, protect bacteria against infection by bacteriophages (reviews: [11,12]). These systems are present in almost all bacterial species. In addition to the MTase, they contain a restriction endonuclease that cleaves incoming phage DNA at speci¢c recognition sites (review: [13]). The cellular DNA is not attacked, because it is methylated within the recognition site of the RM system by the MTase. To render the host DNA resistant to cleavage, even in the transient phase after DNA replication when methylation of the newly synthesized DNA has not yet taken place, the MTases modify both strands of the DNA and the restriction enzymes do not (or only very poorly) cleave hemimethylated DNA. In type II RM systems which are most common [14], one MTase can modify both strands of the DNA, because these systems have palindromic recognition sites. In contrast, type IIS RM systems (review: [15]) need two MTases to modify both strands of the DNA, because they have asymmetric recognition sites. Occasionally, the two MTases of type IIS systems are fused to each other forming one tandem enzyme, for example in the case of the FokI DNA MTase from Flavobacterium okeanokoites. This enzyme methylates the N6 -positions of both adenines within the asymmetric FokI recognition site (5P-GGATG-3P/5P-CATCC-3P) (EC 2.1.1.72) [16,17]. It consists of two domains each of which contains a full set of amino acid sequence motifs

characteristic for adenine-N6 MTases [17^19] (Fig. 1). Both domains are independent of each other inasmuch as individually cloned N-terminal (amino acids 1^367) and C-terminal fragments (amino acids 335^647) are catalytically active [20]. The N-terminal domain methylates the GGATG-strand of the recognition sequence, whereas the C-terminal part modi¢es the CATCC-strand [18,20,21]. Recently, we found that the C-terminal domain of M.FokI also methylates the upper strand of the recognition sequence (GGATG), albeit at slower rates [20]. This result prompted us to investigate the speci¢city of M.FokI(1^367) and M.FokI(335^647) in more detail by analyzing the rates of methylation of target sites which di¡er from the recognition sites of both enzymes only in 1 bp (`star sites') or sites which di¡er in two positions from the recognition sequence. In order to understand the molecular architecture of the M.FokI^DNA complex, protein^protein interaction assays with both domains of M.FokI were carried out. Moreover, we have investigated DNA binding by full-length M.FokI and both of its domains using non-speci¢c, unmethylated and hemimethylated substrates of di¡erent length to ¢nd out if both domains of full-length M.FokI could simultaneously bind to the DNA. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Enzymes GST-M.FokI(1^367), His6 -M.FokI(1^367) and His6 -M.FokI(335^647) were puri¢ed as described [20], except that in the case of M.FokI(335^647), cell lysis was carried out in 30 mM KPi , pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Lubrol. His6 -tagged M.FokI was cloned in pET28 (Novagen), expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3, pLys) and puri¢ed as described [20]. The GST-tagged variant of the N-terminal domain of M.FokI was only used in the protein^protein interaction assay. The M.FokI(1^367) and M.FokI(335^647) preparations were s 95% pure as estimated from Coomassie blue stained SDS polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2). The purity of the M.FokI preparations was s 80% (Fig. 2). Protein concentrations were determined using extinction coe¤cient estimated on the basis

of the amino acid composition [22]: GST-M.FokI(1^ 367), 98 600; His6 -M.FokI(1^367), 55 700; His6 M.FokI(335^647), 39 300; and His6 -M.FokI, 92 000. Active site titrations were carried out with all protein preparations to measure the amount of active protein in the preparation. All enzyme concentrations refer to the concentrations of active enzyme. 2.2. Oligonucleotides HPLC-puri¢ed oligonucleotides were purchased from Interactiva (Ulm) and Eurogentec (Seraing). The concentrations of the oligonucleotides were determined from the optical density at 260 nm using extinction coe¤cients provided by the supplier. Substrates were annealed by mixing equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides, heating to 90³C for 5 min and slowly cooling to 20³C. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used for the binding experiments: an unmethylated 40 mer

Moreover, a 40 mer that does not contain a M.FokI recognition site (40 ns), a 15 mer containing one M.FokI recognition site (Fok15) and a PCR product of 1000 bp length containing two M.FokI sites at nucleotide positions 99 and 147 were employed. A series of 19-mer oligonucleotides was used for the methylation kinetics. 2.3. DNA binding analyses DNA binding was assayed in binding bu¡er (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM S-adenosylhomocysteine) using a Nitrocellulose ¢lter binding assay as described [23,24]. Oligonucleotides were labeled using [Q-32 P]ATP (NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase

Methylation kinetics Methylation reactions were carried out using a thin layer chromatography assay and radioactively labeled [methyl-14 C] AdoMet (NEN) as described [20,23]. All methylation experiments were carried out under single turnover conditions using enzyme concentrations of 6 WM in the case of M.FokI(335^ 647) and 3 WM in the case of M.FokI(1^367). The reaction mixture containing 50 WM labeled AdoMet and 0.2 WM oligonucleotide substrate in 50 mM Tris/ HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM Dithioerythritol, 2 mM EDTA and 1 mg/ml BSA was incubated at ambient temperature and 2-Wl aliquots were withdrawn at increasing time points, spotted onto a DEAE-thin layer plate (Macherey and Nagel, Duren). To reduce the back« ground of radioactivity, the spots were not allowed to dry on the thin layer plate, but the chromatography was run immediately after each sampling in 50 mM KPi pH 7.5. The radioactivity of the spots was analyzed using a phosphorimager (Fuji). The initial rates of methyl group transfer were determined by linear regression using the initial parts of the reaction progress curves (up to 25% turnover). In each experimental series, one methylation reaction was carried out using the fully methylated control substrate (GGm ATG/Cm ATCC). These reactions re£ect the background of the method due to unequal sensitivities of di¡erent regions of the phosphorimager plates. The mean slope of these reactions was 0.01

(MBI Fermentas). Labeled PCR products were prepared by using labeled PCR primers in the PCR reaction. PCR products were puri¢ed using Qiaquick PCR puri¢cation kits (Qiagen). The puri¢ed 1000 mer consisted of one single species running at the expected position in a polyacrylamide gel. To calculate the DNA binding constant (KAss ) of the enzyme, the experimental data (cpm) were ¢tted to Eq. 1, which is derived from the law of mass action applied to a bimolecular binding equilibrium. Least squares ¢tting was carried out using the Solver function of Excel (Microsoft).

All binding experiments were carried out in triplicate. Deviations of the results from the individual experiments were used for error estimation. To determine the fraction of active enzyme in the enzyme preparations, active site titrations were carried out with all enzyme preparations by incubating 20^100 nM enzyme with 1 nM labeled FokR and increasing concentrations of unlabeled FokR. This titration is described by Eq. 2 which is derived from Eq. 1 by replacing the enzyme concentration by cE UfE where

fmol/min for the N-terminal domain and 0.02 fmol/ min with the C-terminal domain averaged over all reactions. In both cases, the individual values differed by about þ 0.05 fmol/min, demonstrating that no signi¢cant methylation takes place. With each individual substrate, methylation reactions were carried out at least in duplicate, most of them in triplicate. After subtraction of the slopes of the control reactions, methylation rates were reproducible within a factor of two. To interpret the results of the kinetic experiments, we estimated the minimal methylation rate constant that could be unequivocally measured under the experimental conditions on the basis of the following considerations:

rate constants become methylated or are completely resistant to methylation is uncertain. 2.5. Domain interaction assay To study the interaction of both domains of M.FokI, GST-tagged N-terminal domain of M.FokI and His6 -tagged C-terminal domain were used. The assay relies on the co-puri¢cation of the GST-tagged enzyme on a His6 -a¤nity resin in the presence of His6 -tagged M.FokI(335^647) which can only occur if the domains of M.FokI interact with each other. The His6 -tagged C-terminal domain of M.FokI (110 nM) was incubated with di¡erent amounts of the GST-tagged N-terminal domain (0^200 nM) in 200 Wl bu¡er (50 mM NaH2 PO4 (pH 7.5), 10 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 30 min at ambient temperature. BSA (0.1 Wg/ml) was included in most experiments to shield non-speci¢c hydrophobic interactions. After addition of 10 Wl Ni-NTA Magnetic Agarose Beads suspension (Qiagen), the mixture was incubated for another 30 min with gentle shaking to allow binding of the His6 -tagged proteins to the beads. The beads were collected using a magnetic separator (Qiagen) and the supernatant was discarded. Subsequently, the beads were washed twice with Washing bu¡er (200 Wl 50 mM NaH2 PO4 pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Proteins were eluted by incubation with 50 mM NaH2 PO4 (pH 7.5), 250 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. A nitrocellulose membrane was equilibrated in Washing bu¡er for 30 min. Eluted proteins were sucked through the nitrocellulose membrane and the membrane washed twice with Washing bu¡er. The detection of GST-tagged N-terminal domain on the nitrocellulose membrane was carried out using an Anti-GST antibody (Pharmacia Biotech) and Anti-Goat IgG Alkaline Phosphatase Conjugate (Sigma) in dilutions as recommended by the suppliers. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in 50 ml blocking bu¡er (100 mM Tris/HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% w/v skimmed milk powder) for 12 h at 4³C. The bu¡er was discarded and the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with Anti-GST antibody in blocking bu¡er for 1^2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The membrane was incubated three times for 10 min in 100 mM Tris/HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 with gen-

We have manually inspected all individual kinetics and compared them with the results obtained with the fully methylated control substrate in the parallel experiments. Only, if each individual experiment with one substrate indicated a signi¢cant incorporation of radioactivity, the substrate was regarded as being methylated. With this criterion, we found that mean methylation rates exceeding values of 0.05 fmol/min always indicated signi¢cant methylation. Lower rates usually were not reproducible. This threshold value holds for M.FokI(1^367) and M.FokI(335^647). In some cases, we found that the apparent rate of incorporation of radioactivity into the substrates was lower than the apparent rate of incorporation into the fully methylated control substrate in parallel experiments. These negative `rates' never exceeded the value of 30.04 fmol/min. Thus, a value of þ 0.04 fmol/min might be taken as the estimate of error inherent in our results. We have compared the errors of the individual experiments carried out with each substrate. These errors did not exceed values of þ 0.05 fmol/min with substrates that were slowly methylated.

On the basis of these three independent lines of evidence, we estimate a value of 0.05 fmol/min as threshold of signi¢cance in our experiments, corresponding to a single turnover rate constant of 0.075 h31 . This implicates that methylation rates above this limit almost certainly mean that a substrate is methylated. Whether substrates with lower methylation

tle shaking. The membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody in blocking bu¡er for 1 h. After three washing steps, the membrane was incubated with one BCIP/NBT substrate tablet (Sigma) dissolved in 10 ml deionized water. Quanti¢cation of the emerging color was carried out with a video documentation system and the TINA program (raytest Isotopenmessgerate, Straubenhardt, Germany). As « control, identical experiments were carried out in the absence of His6 -tagged proteins and in the presence of 110 nM His6 -tagged EcoRV methyltransferase, puri¢ed as described [23]. For titration experiments, 11 pmol of M.FokI(1^367) and 15 pmol M.FokI(335^647) were incubated in di¡erent volumes of the incubation bu¡er (50^400 Wl) resulting in di¡erent concentrations of both proteins. The samples were processed as described above. Following this procedure, identical molar amounts of proteins were used in all experiments. Therefore, any di¡erence in the signal intensity observed cannot be due to saturation of the Ni-NTA beads or the ELISA reaction. 3. Results 3.1. Interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains of M.FokI To analyze if both domains of the two-domain enzyme M.FokI interact with each other, the His6 tagged C-terminal domain was mixed with the GSTtagged N-terminal domain. The proteins were bound to Ni-NTA agarose beads and the co-puri¢cation of the N-terminal domain was analyzed by ELISA reactions directed against the GST domain. As a control, identical experiments were carried out without the C-terminal domain or in the presence of His6 tagged EcoRV methyltransferase. As shown in Fig. 3A signi¢cantly more GST-FokI(1^367) was detected after incubation with His6 -FokI(335^647) than in the presence of His6 -tagged M.EcoRV or in the absence of His6 -tagged proteins. Addition of BSA at 0.1 Wg/ ml to the incubation bu¡er to reduce non-speci¢c interaction had no detectable e¡ect on these results. These data demonstrate that both domains of the FokI DNA methyltransferase interact with each other. To estimate the binding constant of both doFig. 3.

Results from three independent titration experiments can be ¢tted to binding curves with a dissociation constant of 2 ( þ 1)U1037 M1 , demonstrating that the Kd is in the 0.1^1 WM range. Since in M.FokI, both domains are covalently attached to each other resulting in very high local concentrations, the domains presumably are tightly connected in the full-length enzyme. 3.2. Speci¢city of DNA methylation by the N- and C-terminal domains of M.FokI To determine the speci¢city of DNA methylation of both domains of M.FokI in quantitative terms, methylation rates of 27 double-stranded hemimethylated oligonucleotide substrates were measured with

both domains of M.FokI. The C-terminal domain of M.FokI has been reported to recognize CATCC sequences [18,21]. However, we have demonstrated previously that it also methylates GGATG sequences using a target sequence that is £anked by a cytosine on the 3P side (5P-GGATGC/GCm ATCC-3P) [20]. For reasons of comparison, we have used a GGATGC target site in the present work as well. The substrates either contain the canonical recognition sequence (GGATG/CATCC) or a sequence derived from GGATG/CATCC by an exchange of one bp2 . Only the target base was not exchanged in this study. In all of these substrates, either the upper or the lower strand of the recognition sequence is methNote, that two pairs of substrates contain the same recognition site, GCATGC/GCm ATCC corresponds to GCm ATGC/GCATGC and GGATCC/GCm ATCC corresponds to GGm ATCC/ GGATCC. These substrates were used in only one con¢guration.

ylated to direct the methyltransferase activity to one strand of the DNA. To rule out methylation at other adenines, the oligonucleotides did not contain additional adenine residues. In order to ¢nd out if the cytosine following the GGATG recognition site has any in£uence on the results, two substrates containing GGATGT/ACm ATCC and GGm ATGT/ACATCC sites were also analyzed. Examples of the methylation kinetics are shown in Fig. 4. All results, together with the deviations between di¡erent measurements using the same substrate, are given in Tables 1 and 2. The results are graphically displayed in Fig. 5. M.FokI(1^367) prefers hemimethylated target sequences over unmethylated. It is a quite speci¢c enzyme, because none of the substrates containing sites which di¡er in more than 1 bp from GGATG is accepted and we could detect methylation of only one star substrate (AGATG). Moreover, the rate of

methyl group transfer to AGATG is strongly reduced with respect to GGATG. In contrast, the Cterminal domain is a relatively unspeci¢c MTase as illustrated by the following observations: (1) The rate of methylation of the TATCC-star site is only 3-fold reduced with respect to the canonical site CATCC; (2) 10 of the 12 star sites are methylated with rates reduced by less than two orders of magnitude and only two star sites are not accepted; and (3) It modi¢es substrates containing GGATGC and CGATGC sites which di¡er in two positions from the recognition sequence CATCC of the enzyme. Interestingly, the discrimination between CATCC and TATCC is even more indiscrete than between GCATCC and ACATCC both of which contain a canonical CATCC recognition site. So the e¡ect of bases £anking the recognition site on the rate of methylation is similar to that of the bases within the

Speci¢city of DNA binding by M.FokI, M.FokI(1367) and M.FokI(335^647) To analyze the mode of DNA interaction by M.FokI, DNA binding experiments with M.FokI as well as with the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the enzyme were carried out. Active site titrations demonstrate that the fraction of active protein was between 60 and 100% in all preparations (see Fig. 6A for an example). After correction of the protein concentrations according to the results of the active site titrations, DNA binding constants were reproducible within þ 25% when di¡erent preparations of the same enzyme were used. As shown in Table 3, none of the enzymes binds speci¢cally to the unmethylated 40 mer, because, in each case, the non-speci¢c substrate not containing a GGATG/CATCC site is bound with almost the same a¤nity as the speci¢c substrate. Speci¢c binding also was not observed in bu¡ers containing up to 100 mM NaCl (data not shown). Subsequently, we have also investigated binding to di¡erent hemimethylated 40-mer substrates, containing a GGATG/Cm ATCC or GGm ATG/CATCC site. Whereas the C-terminal do-

main also binds non-speci¢cally to all of these substrates, the N-terminal domain and the full-length enzyme (to a lesser degree) preferentially bind to the GGATG/Cm ATCC substrate. These results ¢t to the data obtained in the kinetic experiments, because the N-terminal domain has a high speci¢city for the hemimethylated GGATG/Cm ATCC site whereas the C-terminal domains methylates DNA less speci¢cally (see above). 3.4. Length dependence of the DNA binding constant of M.FokI If both domains of M.FokI interact simultaneously with the DNA, the DNA binding constants of M.FokI should dramatically increase as soon as the length of the DNA substrate allows simultaneous binding of both domains. The minimal size of the DNA binding site of one domain of M.FokI can be estimated from the sizes of the DNA footprint of several single-domain MTases comparable in size to both of the domains of M.FokI: M.EcoRV comprising 298 amino acid residues has an ExoIII footprint of 21 bp [25], M.MspI (418 amino acid residues) has a DNaseI footprint of 15 bp [26]), the DNaseI footprint of M.BspRI (424 amino acid residues) is 14 bp [27]), the footprints of M.SssI (386 amino acid resi-

dues) and M.HhaI (327 amino acid residues) are 18 and 21 bp, respectively [28]. On the basis of these data, a 15 mer should provide space for binding of only one domain of M.FokI. However, the 40 and 1000 mer should allow for binding of both domains to the DNA. Binding experiments carried out with the unmethylated 15, 40 and 1000 mer are shown in Fig. 6B^D, the equilibrium binding constants (KAss ) derived from three independent experiments are between 1.5U108 M31 and 1.7U108 M31 for all substrates which means that all substrates are bound with the same a¤nity. This result is not in agreement with models assuming simultaneous binding of both domains of M.FokI to one DNA molecule. 3.5. Comparison of the DNA binding constants of M.FokI and both individual domains If both domains of M.FokI interacted simultaneously with the DNA, the binding energy of M.FokI should be the sum of the binding energies of both domains provided that the DNA is of su¤cient length for simultaneous binding of both domain3 . This means that the DNA-binding constant of the full-length enzyme should be in the order of the product of the binding constants of the individual domains. However, the binding constant of M.FokI closely resembles the average of binding constants of the domains with all substrates (Table 3). This result is most easily explained if M.FokI interacts with DNA substrates either via its N-terminal domain or via its C-terminal domain, but not with both doFig. 5.

3 Since both domains interact with each other, additional coupling terms must be taken into consideration for a quantitative analysis.

Fits (lines) of the data points (8) to a bimolecular binding equilibrium (Eq. 2) yielded binding constants of KAss (15 mer) = 1.7( þ 0.2)U108 M31 , KAss (40 mer) = 1.5( þ 0.2)U108 M31 and KAss (1000 mer) = 1.6( þ 0.4)U108 M31 .

mains simultaneously. It argues strongly against binding models in which both domains interact simultaneously with DNA, because even if one considers that interactions between the domains and/or structural changes of the DNA occurred, one would have expected binding constants of the full-length enzyme which are orders of magnitude higher if both domains interacted with the DNA. Taking into account the result that the 1000 mer is not bound more tightly than the 40 mer by full-length M.FokI, simultaneous binding of both domains of M.FokI to the DNA is unlikely. 3.6. Functional interaction of both domains of M.FokI To test if the domains of full-length M.FokI in£uence each other in DNA binding and methylation, several binding experiments and methylation kinetics were carried out with mixtures of both individual domains. However, all results obtained in these experiments were indistinguishable from the sum of the

results obtained with the individual domains (data not shown). This ¢nding demonstrates that both domains of M.FokI do not in£uence each other with respect to their functional properties. It is in good agreement with our conclusion that both domains of M.FokI cannot simultaneously interact with the DNA. 4. Discussion 4.1. Domain architecture of M.FokI Processes like DNA replication, transcription, translation or RNA splicing are carried out by large molecular machines consisting of several proteins that interact with each other as well as with the nucleic acid (reviews: [29^32]). Mechanistic understanding of such systems implies the investigation and quantitative understanding of each binary protein^ protein and protein^DNA interaction as well as

156

their mutual interdependence. The tandem-enzyme M.FokI from Flavobacterium okeanokoites appeared as a particular attractive model of such a multi-protein DNA complex, because only one protein comprising two domains is involved. Given our ¢nding that both domains of M.FokI are catalytically active and both domains bind to DNA, one might have expected that both of them simultaneously contact the DNA in the full-length M.FokI^DNA complex. In this complex, either both domains could bind one next to each other or both domains could bind to DNA independently at remote sites. Examples for proteins exhibiting these binding modes are the FokI restriction enzyme, where the catalytic domain binds to DNA immediately besides the DNA recognition domain [33^35] or the lac-repressor, which binds to DNA producing large loops of the DNA [36,37]. However, our data clearly demonstrate that the DNA interaction of both domains of M.FokI is mutually exclusive and both domains do not in£uence each other functionally. Since each individual domain is able to bind to DNA, this result implies that occupation of the DNA binding site of one domain must prevent DNA interaction of the other domain in the full-length enzyme. Most likely a simultaneous access of the DNA to the DNA binding sites of both domains is sterically excluded in M.FokI. 4.2. Sequence speci¢city of the domains of M.FokI Prokaryotic DNA MTases are generally regarded as being highly speci¢c (reviews: [1,3^5,13,38^44]) ^ these enzymes were even considered as `paradigms for sequence-speci¢c DNA binding proteins' [1]. Surprisingly, this belief is not based on quantitative experimental data, because almost all studies investigating the speci¢city of DNA MTases rely on the restriction protection method. In these experiments, plasmids isolated from bacteria expressing a DNA MTase are digested with di¡erent restriction endonucleases, which are sensitive to DNA methylation. Depending on whether each restriction enzyme does or does not cleave the DNA, one can deduce the methylation status of the corresponding restriction site. These experiments indeed show that DNA MTases do not modify all adenine or cytosine residues within the DNA in a complete unspeci¢c manner, because,

in most cases, only one or a few restriction sites are protected from cleavage. However, some evidence argues against a model assigning a very high sequence speci¢city to all MTases: (1) some DNA MTases do not have a clear recognition sequence [45]; and (2) aberrant DNA methylation has been shown for some DNA MTases to occur at high rates at sites which may di¡er in one to three positions from the canonical sequence [20,46^50]. To analyze the sequence speci¢city of enzymes interacting with DNA in quantitative terms, the rates of enzymatic turnover of substrates that closely resemble the recognition site have to be determined. In fact, such experiments have been carried out only for a few adenine DNA MTases so far (DpnA: recognition sequence, GATC, modi¢ed adenine is underlined [51]; M.EcoRI, GAATTC [47]). It turned out, that DpnA and M.EcoRI methylate several of their starsites with rates only reduced by factors of 5^10 suggesting that DNA MTases might be much less speci¢c than restriction endonucleases. We have investigated the speci¢city of DNA methylation by both domains of M.FokI using a series of oligodeoxynucleotide substrates. The N-terminal domain displays a very high speci¢city for GGATG that is comparable to that of restriction enzymes [52^54]. In contrast, the C-terminal domain is not very speci¢c for CATCC, because it also recognizes most sequences di¡ering in 1 bp from the recognition site. Moreover, it also accepts substrates di¡ering in two positions from the 5-bp consensus sequence. Comparable results have never been obtained with restriction enzymes, which always cleave star sites with much more reduced rates, and do not cleave sites di¡ering in 2 bp from the recognition sequence. These results clearly show that MTases are a heterogeneous group of enzymes some being very speci¢c and others not. One of the most striking features of this work is the ability of M.FokI(335^647) to methylate GGATG sequences. This observation could be interpreted in two ways: either the enzyme has a dual speci¢city for CATCC and GGATG, as found for some phage encoded cytosine-C5 MTases [55^59] or its speci¢city is quite relaxed. According to our data, M.FokI(335^647) clearly has no `speci¢city' for GGATG, because GGATG sites are only methylated in a GGATGC, but not in a GGATGT context.

Therefore, this enzyme cannot be compared to multispeci¢c methyltransferases. This result implies that the GGATGC and CGATGC sites are recognized as a CATCC containing a G at position 1 and 4. However, M.FokI(335^647) only accepts these two substrates that di¡er in two positions from the recognition sequence. Ten other substrates which also di¡er in two positions from CATCC are not methylated, indicating that the speci¢city of the enzyme is not completely relaxed. Our data can be summarized by the rules that: (1) M.FokI(335^647) prefers CATCC sites; other sequences can be modi¢ed by M.FokI(335^647) either (2) if they di¡er from CATCC in only one base pair or (3) if they have an SGATGC sequence (S = G or C). It should be noticed, that DNA recognition is a complex process. Several interactions between the enzyme and the target sequence are formed which concertedly lead to a cooperative conformational change of the enzyme^DNA complex and activation of the catalytic center. This means, that the importance of any contact between the enzyme and substrate depends on the pattern of additional contacts formed. This complexity is illustrated by the following observations with M.FokI(335^647):

di¡ering in two positions from CATCC that are modi¢ed by this enzyme. 4.3. Implications on the molecular evolution of M.FokI Molecular evolution of DNA MTases proceeds by integration of DNA recognition domains at di¡erent positions in a conserved catalytic framework [19,60^ 62] and circular permutations of the amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain [63]. RM systems assemble in a new host by sequential horizontal gene transfer of the genes for an MTase and a restriction endonuclease [64]. Later the genes of the endonuclease and MTase may become linked [11,65], which facilitates maintenance of the RM system and spreading into new hosts. Our results have interesting implications on the molecular evolution of type IIS RM systems which is di¤cult to rationalize, because three enzymes (two MTases and one endonuclease) of matching speci¢cities are required to establish a functional RM system that provides an evolutionary advantage. However, it is very unlikely that such a gene cluster could have formed by chance. To overcome this barrier, an MTase would be required, that could methylate both strands of the asymmetric recognition sequence of the endonuclease. In the case of the M.FokI system, this means that an MTase speci¢c for SSATSS would be required. On the basis of our results, we suggest that the C-terminal domain of M.FokI could have been this precursor MTase, because ^ at least in a certain sequence context ^ this enzyme prefers an S at the ¢rst, second and ¢fth position of the target sequence. Later, the N-terminal enzyme could have been added either by gene transfer or gene duplication. After acquisition of this second enzyme, the original MTase was no longer under evolutionary pressure to recognize GGATG sequences and got freedom to specialize for CATCC. Our results suggest that M.FokI(335^367) is an evolutionary intermediate that currently changes its speci¢city from SSATSS to CATCC. The result that only one domain of the M.FokI enzyme interacts with DNA at each time might appear surprising at ¢rst sight, because an architecture in which both domains simultaneously interact with DNA seems to provide important advantages: the

If a XCATCC sequence is bound, an A at position 1 is supportive for methylation (kACATCC s kGCATCC ). However, in the context of XGATGC, the enzyme recognizes an S at this position (kCGATGC WkGGATGC s kAGATGC WkTGATGC ). In the context of GXATGC sequences, the enzyme has a preference for S at position 2 (kGGATGC W kGCATGC EkGAATGC WkGTATGC ). In GXATCC, the order of methylation rates is completely di¡erent and a C is preferred (kGCATCC s kGTATCC s kGGATCC WkGAATGC ). In the GCATXC sequence, a strong preference for C over G, T and A exits (kGCATCC EkGCATGC W kGCATAC WkGCATTC ), whereas in the GGATXC context, the enzyme prefers S (kGGATGC W kGGATCC s kGGATAC WkGGATTC ).

Thus, M.FokI(335^647) has a tendency to prefer S at the ¢rst, second and ¢fth position of NNATNN sequences. Perhaps, this result might explain why GGATGC and CGATGC are the only sequences

binding a¤nity would increase, the e¤ciency of target site location by sliding along the DNA would increase and both strands of the DNA could be methylated processively. Perhaps this discrepancy between what is found and what appears to be ideal for function may also be explained in evolutionary terms by the model that M.FokI is an evolutionary intermediate that has not yet been functionally optimized. It should be noticed that a simple fusion of the domains of M.FokI in a way that allows simultaneous interaction with DNA might be impossible, because the DNA binding constant of this fusion protein would be roughly at 1016 M31 . Such a very strong DNA binding might interfere with other enzymatic processes involving DNA, for example, it might be di¤cult to displace such a hypothetical protein during DNA replication or transcription. Moreover, even if one assumes that the kinetics of DNA binding were di¡usionally controlled with an association rate constant of KAss W108 M31 s31 , the rate of dissociation of the protein^DNA complex would be in the order of 1038 s31 (4U1035 h31 ). This means, that such a protein would never dissociate from a DNA molecule after binding to it ^ a property that again might cause severe problems in DNA metabolism. Consequently, generation of a domain fusion that allows for simultaneous access of the DNA to the DNA binding sites of both domains requires adaptations and ¢ne tuning of both domains and, therefore, might take some time. Thus, two very di¡erent lines of experimental evidence ^ kinetic study of the speci¢city of both domains of M.FokI and thermodynamic analysis of the architecture of the M.FokIDNA complex ^ lead to the conclusion that M.FokI has not been ¢nally optimized in molecular evolution. 5. Conclusions We have shown that both domains of M.FokI interact with each other. Nevertheless, DNA binding of both domains is mutually exclusive. The N-terminal domain of M.FokI is a very speci¢c enzyme con¢rming the idea that some DNA MTases recognize DNA very accurately. On the contrary the C-terminal domain of M.FokI displays only moderate sequence speci¢city because it also methylates sites dif-

fering in 1 or 2 bp from the recognition site with high rates. Our results imply that DNA MTases are a heterogeneous group of enzymes, some of them being very speci¢c and others not. We suggest a model of the evolution of the FokI RM system which might be applicable to type IIS RM systems in general. Our data suggest that M.FokI has not yet been ¢nally optimized in evolution.
