Therapeutic implications As discussed above, the replication of HIV-1 depends on the presence of CyI'A during the early cycle of infection. Treatment of HIV-l-infected cells with CsA disrupts the CyPA-Gag binding, and thus substantially decreases the ability of HIV-I to replicate and infect. Therefore, it was proposed that the propagation of HIV-l infection could be inhibited effectively with CsA. Unfortunately, the doses of CsA used effectively it7 z,itro to disrupt CyPA-Gag binding are lU-100-fold higher than the doses tolerated by humans iu zrizo. However, lower concentrations of CsA may be effective at inhibiting HIV-l-mediated immunodeficiency by preventing T-cell activation. It is for this reason that CsA is routinely used in organ transplantation. The treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals with CsA is not a new idea dnd was attempted early in the AIDS epidemi@. After initial promising results, CsA treatment failed to reduce virus load and did not yield long-term benefits for the patients. However, it was reported that HIV-l-infected patients who received CsA for the prevention of organ graft rejection after transplantation had a significantly lower incidence of AIDS (Ref. 17). Further experiments even showed that CsA can induce apoptosis in CD4' T cells. A computer-simulated `cyber-analysis' that considers the possibility of ablating the target population of HIV in combination with a reduction of retroviral replication suggests that HIV could be eliminated over time". Indeed, the available data indicate

that it is worthwhile to proceed with the possible application of CsA in HIV-1 infections. Unfortunately, since HIV-2 and other retroviruses do not require CyPA, they are not sensitive to CsA, and it is anticipated that HIV-1 might eventually mutate to a CsA-insensitive state.

Perspectives Although the treatment of an acquired immunodeficiency with a potent imniunosuppressive drug such as CsA has already been suggested'"-?", the results have not been conclusive. II has been shown convincingly that HIV-l Gag function can be inhibited by CsA via its interaction with CyPA (Refs 2,3); however, the toxicity of the required dosage prevents CsA achieving this effect clinically. Therefore, it might be desirable to test CsA analogues that interfere with HIV-1 Gag but are less toxic. Although lower concentrations of CsA prevent T-cell activation and, therefore, the effect of IHYv'-l-specificCTLs, CsA is probably not capabie of preventing their induction and expansion. Both arms of CsA function in HIV-1 infection (Fig. 1) do not eliminate the virus from the host, and might even worsen the state of immunocompetence. However, the combination of CsA (or its analogucs) with other drugs, such as nucleotide analogces [e.g. 3'-azido3'-deoxy-thymidine (AZT) or 2',3'-dideoxycylidine (DDC)], HIV-l-protease inhibitors?`, and antibotics to prevent opportunistic infections, might provide long-term benefit to HIV-l-infected individuals.
