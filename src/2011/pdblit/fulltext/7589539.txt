Abstract The gene encoding the D-aminotransferase from Bacillus licheniformis was cloned and the complete DNA sequence was determined. The deduced D-aminotransferase protein sequence, consists of 283 amino acids and shows a high degree of homology with other Bacillus D-aminotransferases, branched chain aminotransferase of Escherichia coli and the 4-aminobenzoate-4-deoxychorismate lyase of Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli.

acid transaminase activity ZDAT. has been demonstrated in a variety of bacterial species w1≠4x. DAT's are generally thought to be involved in the production of D-glutamate for cell wall biosynthesis and in the production of peptide antibiotics. Bacillus licheniformis produces a family of related peptide antibiotics called bacitracins which have in their structure D-amino acids. These D-amino acids have previously been shown Zwith the exception of Dalanine, which is made by an alanine racemase. to be formed by the action of DAT w5x. The Daminotransferases are an interesting group of enzymes due to their broad, but species-specific substrate range. The dat from Bacillus species ZYM1. has been cloned, sequenced w6x and the crystal structure has been solved w7x and recently, the dat gene from Staphylococcus haemolyticus w8x and Bacillus

Here we describe the cloning and DNA sequencing of the dat gene from Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 10716 and its homology to the known dat genes. B. licheniformis ATCC 10716 genomic DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI until the average fragment size was in 0.5≠3.0 kb range. The partially digested DNA fragments were mixed and ligated into plasmid pIF306 which had been digested with BamHI and BglII. pIF306 is a pBR322 w9x derived plasmid which has a modified, constitutive pheA promoter upstream from a unique BamHI site, making it a useful general cloningrexpression vector Z Ian Fotheringham, unpublished observation.. Escherichia coli WT217 w10x was electroporated with the ligated DNA and recombinants were selected by plating the ligation mixes on LB agar plus 100 m grml ampicillin. Approximately 10 000 transformants were pooled and plasmid DNA was isolated. The resultant plasmid

DNA was electroporated into E. coli WM335 and dat recombinants were selected by plating on LB agar supplemented with 50 mgrml thymine and 100 m grml ampicillin. WM335 Za D-glutamic acid auxotroph. cannot grow in the absence of D-glutamic acid, so only recombinants carrying a functional Daminotransferase or glutamate racemase can survive w11x. From the screen twelve recombinants were isolated and preliminary restriction analysis of the twelve clones showed there were two classes of unrelated recombinants Z data not shown. . To determine that a dat gene had been cloned, crude lysates of each type were assayed for DAT activity using a coupled Dalanine, D-amino transferase assay w12x. The assay was performed plus and minus D-alanine so that the endogenous NADH oxidase could be accounted for. Extracts of the clones carrying the dat gene had 6-fold more activity in the presence of D-ala Zindicat-

ing that the dat gene had in fact been cloned., whereas extracts of clones without DAT activity showed no increased activity in the presence of D-ala. The latter were possibly glutamate racemase clones, but were not further analyzed. This is interesting because it has been generally thought that Bacillus do not have a glutamate racemase gene. The smallest clone Z pPT347, 1.9 kb insert. was sequenced on both DNA strands using an fmol DNA sequencing kit ZPromega Corporation. by primer walking on both DNA strands. The start of the dat gene was found 247 bp downstream from the pheA promoter of the vector and the complete DNA sequence is shown in Fig. 1. One open reading frame containing 283 amino acids Z M r 31396. was found. Comparison of this sequence to the Genbank database using TFASTA ZTable 1. showed that the B. licheniformis dat gene product exhibited a very high degree of homology with the DAT's from S. haemolyticus, Bacillus sp. and B. sphaericus as well as significant homology with the pabC and il’E gene products, suggesting that these enzymes may be mechanistically similar. Using MOTIFS ZGCG, WI. the homology to ADC and BCAT is most striking in the region spanning the ALL motif, suggesting that the B. licheniformis dat belongs to the class-IV aminotransferase subfamily w13x. In contrast, there is very strong homology across the whole protein of all the known DAT's Zas might be expected., but interestingly the

B. licheniformis protein is the least homologous of all the dat genes sequenced to date. For example, whereas the Bacillus sp. and B. sphaericus dat gene products show 66% absolute identity the B. licheniformis D-AAT shows only 45% and 42% respectively. This difference is clearly shown in the UPGMA plot Z Fig. 2., the B. licheniformis D-AAT is actually the most distantly related enzyme, whereas the Bacillus sp. and B. sphaericus enzymes are in evolutionary terms closely related. It is well documented that the latter two DAT's show a wide range of substrate specificities and we are currently studying the substrate range of the B. licheniformis DAT to determine if it is also true for this enzyme. Knowledge of the substrate specificities of these enzymes in conjunction with molecular modeling should allow predictions for mutagenesis strategies for the en-
