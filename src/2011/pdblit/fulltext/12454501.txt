Structure of the Humicola insolens cellobiohydrolase Cel6A D416A mutant in complex with a non-hydrolysable substrate analogue, methyl Ê cellobiosyl-4-thio-b-cellobioside, at 1.9 A
The enzymatic degradation of cellulose continues to be one of the most important enzyme-catalysed reactions. Glycoside hydrolases from family GH-6 hydrolyse cellulose with inversion of the con®guration of the anomeric carbon. Whilst the catalytic proton donor has been clearly identi®ed (Asp226 in Humicola insolens Cel6A), the identi®cation and even the existence of a potential Brùnsted base remains unclear. Equally controversial is the role of surface-loop ¯exibility. Here, the structure of the D416A mutant of the H. insolens cellobiohydrolase Cel6A in complex with a nonhydrolysable thiooligosaccharide methyl cellobiosyl-4-thio--celloÊ bioside at 1.9 A resolution is presented. Substrate distortion in the À1 subsite, to a 2S0 skew-boat conformation, is observed, similar to that seen in the analogous Trichoderma reesei Cel6A structure [Zou et al. (1999), Structure, 7, 1035±1045], but the active-centre N-terminal loop of the H. insolens enzyme is found in a more open conformation than described for previous structures.

The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose remains one of the most important enzyme-catalysed reactions. It is integral to biosphere maintenance through the recycling of plant biomass; it also ®nds numerous and increasing industrial applications, whilst glucosidases in general are often considered as model systems for enzymatic action (Zechel & Withers, 2000). Over 87 families of glycoside hydrolases (GH) are known, with cellulases described in at least 12 distinct families (see http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/ ~cazy/CAZY/index.html; Coutinho & Henrissat, 1999). Family GH-6 contains both endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases, which are believed to act on so-called `amorphous' and crystalline cellulose, respectively. These classes differ mainly through the topography of their substrate-binding channels: open grooves in endoglucanases and enclosed tunnels conferred by two extended surface loops in the cellobiohydrolases (Davies & Henrissat, 1995; Rouvinen et al., 1990). The ¯exibility of these loops may account for many of the unusual properties of these enzymes, which are discussed more fully in Varrot et al. (2000). GH-6 enzymes perform the hydrolysis of cellulose with inversion of anomeric con®guration (Rouvinen et al., 1990; Schou et al., 1993) in a single-displacement mechanism. This canonical mechanism is generally believed to demand the presence of at least two

carboxylate groups: a Brùnsted acid to protonate the glycosidic bond and assist leaving-group departure, and a catalytic base to activate a hydrolytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack at the anomeric centre (Koshland, 1953). For family GH-6 enzymes, the acid has been identi®ed both through three-dimensional structure determination of enzyme complexes and elegant mutagenesis experiments (Damude et al., 1995, 1996; Varrot, È Hastrup et al., 1999; Varrot, Schulein et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999). The catalytic proton È donor of Cel6A is Asp226 (Varrot, Schulein et al., 1999). Although pH pro®les reveal both acid and base components to catalysis, consistent with the paradigmatic inversion mechanism, the identity and even the existence of a classical Brùnsted base in the family GH-6 enzyme mechanism remains unclear (Damude et al., 1995, 1996; Varrot, Hastrup et al., 1999; È Varrot, Schulein et al., 1999; Wolfgang & Wilson, 1999; Zou et al., 1999). The residue equivalent to Asp405 of Cel6A has been considered to be a candidate in many systems (Damude et al., 1996; Spezio et al., 1993; Varrot, È Schulein et al., 1999), but other data argue against this proposal (Rouvinen et al., 1990; Wolfgang & Wilson, 1999; Zou et al., 1999) and consequently none of the potential candidates are convincing. The identi®cation of base catalysts in inverting glycoside hydrolases is often ambigVarrot et al.

uous (Nurizzo, Nagy et al., 2002; Nurizzo, Turkenburg et al., 2002). The inconsistencies between reported mutagenesis data for potential base mutants of family GH-6 enzymes (described above) led us to investigate the family 6 enzymes from H. insolens in more detail. Mutation of the H. insolens endoglucanase Cel6B putative base Asp (corresponding to Asp265 of the T. fusca E2, Asp405 of H. insolens Cel6A and Asp401 of the T. reesei Cel6A) led to an essentially inactive enzyme, consistent with results on the C. ®mi endoglucanase (Damude et al., 1995, 1996). Conversely, mutation of D405 of the H. insolens cellobiohydrolase Cel6A to either Asn or Ala, however, resulted in an enzyme with activity on reduced cellohexaose reduced by just 100±300-fold (lecture by È the late Martin Schulein to the 2001 Carbohydrate Bioengineering Meeting, Stockholm). These perplexing results, mirroring inconsistencies across the whole family, led us to consider whether additional basic residues could `rescue' phenotypic differences in the cellobiohydrolase members of the family. Asp416 of Cel6A lies in a position where it could potentially activate a water for `inverting' attack at C1 should the true base be deleted. It is conserved in all the family GH-6 cellobiohydrolases, but is on a loop absent in the endoglucanase members of this family. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of the D416A mutant of H. insolens Cel6A in complex with a nonhydrolysable thiooligosaccharide, methyl cellobiosyl-4-thio--cellobioside (hereafter Ê called Glc2-S-Glc2), at 1.9 A resolution. The ligand spans the active centre and displays distortion of the À1 subsite sugar to an unusual 2S0 skew-boat conformation similar to that observed for the corresponding enzyme from T. reesei (Zou et al., 1999), but displaying a much more open substrate tunnel than in previous Cel6A structures. column in Tris±HCl buffer pH 8.0 and a sodium chloride gradient (0±500 mM) for elution. The protein was ®nally concentrated to 7 mg mlÀ1 in water. Cel6A was ®rst incubated with 1 mM Glc2-S-Glc2 for 1 h prior to crystallization in hanging drops from a solution containing 20% PEG 5K MME, 100 mM NaOAc pH 4.6 and 200 mM MgOAc. 20% glycerol was added to the crystallization condition as a cryoprotectant prior to crystal mounting in rayon-®bre loops and freezing in an N2 stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K at ESRF Ê (Grenoble), beamline ID14-2 (! = 0.933 A), using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD as detector. Data were processed and reduced using the HKL suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). All further computing used the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994), unless otherwise stated. The Cel6A D416A mutant in complex with Glc2-S-Glc2 was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the native wild type (PDB code 1bvw) as a search model (Varrot, Hastrup et al., 1999) with the program AMoRe (Navaza & Saludjian, 1997). 5% of the observations were immediately set aside for cross-validation analysis È (Brunger, 1992) and were used to monitor various re®nement strategies such as the weighting of geometrical and temperaturefactor restraints and the insertion of solvent water during maximum-likelihood re®nement using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). Manual corrections of the model using the X-FIT routines of the program QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) were interspersed with cycles of maximumlikelihood re®nement. `Riding' H atoms were only included when their position were de®nable. Water molecules were added in an automated manner using REFMAC/ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993; Murshudov et al., 1997) and veri®ed manually prior to deposition of coordinates. The incorporation of the ligand was performed after inspection of the mFo À DFc weighted map. plicity of observation of 3.8 (3.7) in the Ê resolution range 30.0±1.90 A (data in parentheses are for the outer resolution Ê shell, 1.93±1.90 A). The ®nal model structure has an Rcryst value of 0.166, with an Rfree of 0.211 for data in the resolution range Ê 30.0±1.9 A. This model contains 2827 protein atoms, two sodium ions, one N-acetylglucosamine, one Glc2-S-Glc2 and 270 water molecules. It displays deviations Ê from stereochemical target values of 0.014 A  for bonds and 1.57 for angles, with mean B Ê values of 18.2 A2 (r.m.s.d. B for bonded Ê Ê atoms = 0.83 A2) and 20.7 A2 (r.m.s.d. B for Ê bonded atoms = 2.2 A2) for the main chain and side chains, respectively. The mean Ê solvent B is 25 A2. There are no residues in forbidden regions of the Ramachandran plot; 90% of the residues are in the most favoured regions and 10% are in the additional allowed regions (calculated using PROCHECK; Laskowski et al., 1993). Inspection of the initial electron-density map for the Cel6A D416A mutant con®rmed the mutation and revealed clear density for all four glucose moieties of the thiooligosaccharide. The tetrasacchasride spans the active centre and binds in subsites À2 to +2 (nomenclature according to Davies et al., 1997) (Fig. 1). Glucosides in subsites À2, +1 and +2 are in the 4C1 (chair) conformation. That in the catalytic À1 subsite is distorted to an unusual 2S0 (skewboat) conformation (described below), as has previously been reported for similar complexes of the T. reesei Cel6A wild type (PDB code 1qjw) and the Y169F mutant (1qk2) from T. reesei (Zou et al., 1999). No signi®cant structural changes result from the mutation; indeed, the three equivalent complexes superpose well with an r.m.s.d. of Ê 0.6 A for 357 equivalent C atoms (calculated with LSQMAN; Kleywegt & Jones, 1994). The only signi®cant differences between the T. reesei and H. insolens complexes are observed at the level of the two active-site loops which enclose the cellobiohydroase active-centre tunnel. Family 6 cellobiohydrolases are characterized by the two extended loops that together form an enclosed tunnel, which is believed to maintain a single glucan chain through numerous catalytic events whilst preventing it re-adhering to crystalline cellulose (Davies & Henrissat, 1995; Rouvinen et al., 1990). These loops, although often assumed to be static, are observed in a range of conformations in different family GH-6 structures. The N-terminal loop is found `closed' in the T. reesei wild-type structure (Rouvinen et al., 1990) but more open in the Y169F structure (PDB code

2. Experimental
The D416A mutant of Cel6A from H. insolens was a kind gift from the late Martin È Schulein at Novozymes A/S. Cloning was performed so that only the signal peptide and the catalytic module were expressed after removal of the DNA corresponding to the N-terminal cellulose-binding domain and linker region. The mutant protein was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, puri®ed from the extracellular ¯uid and treated with endoglucanase F as described previously for the wild-type enzyme (Varrot, Hastrup et al., 1999). Anion-exchange chromatography was then performed using a Q-Sepharose

3. Results and discussion
Cel6A mutant D416A possesses approximately 10% residual activity (unpublished data) and in order to obtain a complex, a non-hydrolysable thiooligosaccharide (methyl cellobiosyl-4-thio--cellobioside, Glc2-S-Glc2 whose synthesis is described in Reverbel-Leroy et al., 1998) was harnessed. D416A Cel6A±Glc2-S-Glc2 complex data Ê were collected to 1.9 A and had an Rmerge of 0.062 (0.28), a mean I/'(I) of 21.2 (4.6), a completeness of 99.1% (98.0) and a multi-

1cb2; Koivula et al., 1996). Similarly, partially open and closed structures have been reported for the wild-type H. insolens Cel6A structures in the apo form (PDB code 1bvw; Varrot, Hastrup et al., 1999) and in a glucosecellotetraose complex (PDB code 2bvw; Varrot et al., 2000), respectively. In the corresponding endoglucanase Cel6B structure (PDB code 1dys; Davies et al., 2000) this loop is fully open (Fig. 2). The H. insolens D416A Cel6A structure reveals an opening of the `N-terminal' loop of approximately 30 , resulting from 15±25 changes in the main-chain conformational torsion angles between residues 181±183 and 186±187. We believe that this is the most open conformation for this loop witnessed in a cellobiohydrolase thus far. Furthermore, the C-terminal loop is also slightly shifted by a Ê rigid-body movement of approximately 1 A in order to avoid a steric clash of the main chain of Ala413 with the side chain of Ala185. Within the active centre and substrate tunnel few signi®cant changes are noted, with the exception of the À1 subsite, as described below. The glucosyl moieties in the À2, +1 and +2 subsites are exactly as observed in the glucose-cellotetraose complex (PDB code 2bvw; Davies et al., 2000). In the À1 subsite, the glucose moiety is distorted from a 4C1 chair to a 2S0 skew-boat conformation, coupled with an approximate 90 rotation of the pyranoside ring relative to its neighbours. In this conformation, the only direct hydrogen bond to protein is from the O3 hydroxyl to Asp405; all other interactions are mediated by water molecules. It is unclear whether the 2 S0 conformation re¯ects a genuine conformational point along the reaction trajectory or if it is merely an `artefact' necessary to accommodate the hydroxymethyl group lest it clash with the side chain of Tyr174. Distorted Michaelis complexes of retaining glycoside hydrolases (for an example, see Davies et al., 1998, and references therein) are widely believed to re¯ect the adjacent transition-state conformation for glycoside hydrolysis. The nearest potential transitionstate conformation (i.e. that with C5, O5, C1 and C2 coplanar) to the 2S0 conformation is the 2,5B (boat). On super®cial inspection this would seem catalytically unlikely for glucoside hydrolysis, since it displays unfavourable `bowsprit' interactions between the C5 hydroxymethyl substituent and H2 (Sabini et al., 1999). However, recent evidence for unusual B2,5 (Ducros et al., 2002) and 3H4 (Lobsanov et al., 2002) transition states for - and -mannosidases, respectively, coupled with catalysis via a 2,5B state in

family 11 xylanases (Sabini et al., 1999, 2001; Sidhu et al., 1999) suggests that no potential transition-state conformation should be ruled out. The question of whether the 2S0 conformation observed is catalytically relevant is further complicated by the displacement of the catalytic acid, Asp226, away from the glycosidic S atom in this complex and that reported for the T. reesei Cel6A (PDB code 1qjw; Zou et al., 1999). In contrast to the orientation observed in the H. insolens Cel6A±glucose-cellotetraose È complex (Varrot, Schulein et al., 1999), Ê Asp226 lies 4.5 A away from the glycosidic S atom, with inappropriate geometry for proton transfer (Fig. 2b). The displaced position of Asp226 re¯ects its close interaction with Asp180; this latter residue, implicated in pKa elevation (Damude et al., 1996), interacts with the substrate in the +1 subsite in the glucose-cellotetraose complex. Furthermore, in the D416A Cel6A complex with Glc2-S-Glc2 we see no water molecule poised for inverting nucleophilic attack at C1. Catalysis by family GH-6 members remains dif®cult to dissect on both macroscopic and microscopic levels. The D416A Cel6A complex reported here clearly demonstrates the propensity for loop conformational change, reinforcing earlier È work (Varrot, Schulein et al. et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999). Despite these structural observations on enzymes from different sources, loop movements are still dismissed by many authors. The role of a catalytic base is certainly confusing. The residue equivalent to Asp405 of Cel6A had seemed appropriately placed from a geometrical view in the different structures (Rouvinen et al., È 1990; Spezio et al., 1993; Varrot, Schulein et al., 1999) and was consistent with sitedirected mutagenesis on the endoglucanase A from C. ®mi (Damude et al., 1995). However, mutagenesis on other systems appears to contradict this (Wolfgang & Wilson, 1999), as does the position of Asp405 in the plane of the ring in the Glc2-SGlc2 complexes presented both here and elsewhere (Zou et al., 1999) (Fig. 2b). The complex hydrogen bonding within the active centre of Cel6 enzymes, together with the potential for catalytic rescue by other bases within the binding milieu and the absence of a complex which has all components of the catalytic machinery in the correct location, makes interpretation of site-directed mutagenesis data of partially active enzymes fraught with danger. A great deal of work remains necessary before catalysis by family GH-6 enzymes and their role in cellulose degradation is fully understood. Note added in proof: Since acceptance of this paper, Koivula and colleagues have published even more open Cel6A complexes, for the enzyme from Trichoderma reesei. Modelling studies support a 2,5 B transition-state conformation. These authors also propose that attack of water is aided by a solvent-mediated deprotonation in a Grotthus-type mechanism (Koivula et al., 2002). In an unrelated study, Geurin and colleagues observed a 2,5B conformation for a glucosyl moiety in the active centre of an inverting family 8 endoglucanase also lending credence to a 2,5B transition-state conformation (Guerin et al., 2002).
