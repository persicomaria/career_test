Ê Structures and comparison of the Y98H (2.0 A) and Ê Y98W (1.5 A) mutants of flavodoxin (Desulfovibrio vulgaris)
The structures for two mutants at the Tyr98 site of Desulfovibrio vulgaris ¯avodoxin have been determined. The ®rst, a tyrosine-to-histidine (Y98H) variant, was deterÊ mined at the moderately high resolution of 2.0 A, while the tyrosine-to-tryptophan variant (Y98W) yielded very high Ê resolution data (beyond 1.5 A) allowing a detailed look at the water structure, alternate side-chain conformations and the planarity of the FMN. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement beginning with the native (P2A) coordinates as a starting point. The Y98H variant of D. vulgaris ¯avodoxin crystallizes in space group P212121, Ê with unit-cell parameters a = 41.96, b = 61.45, c = 57.04 A, while the Y98W mutant adopts space group P21, with a = 41.29, Ê b = 55.82, c = 32.52 A,  = 100.68 . Re®nement for both mutants utilized PROLSQ followed by, for the high-resolution Y98W structure, anisotropic re®nement as implemented in SHELXL. Final R factors of 17% for the Y98H mutant and 9.8% for the Y98W mutant were obtained. For the highÊ resolution (1.5 A) Y98W mutant, 31 010 unique re¯ections were collected from a single crystal. The ®nal model includes 273 solvent molecules, with eight side chains assuming multiple conformations. At this resolution, the detailed conformation of the FMN can be observed, with both a bow and twist being noted. A comparison is made between the two mutants and the different oxidation states of the native ¯avodoxin. Although both mutants show similar E2 (oxidized/ semiquinone) one-electron redox potentials to the native, the E1 (semiquinone/hydroquinone) redox potential for the Y98H mutant is signi®cantly different from that of the Y98W variant and the native protein. The surprising similarity in the folding of the polypeptide chain 60±64 between the two mutants and the reduced states of the native is discussed. The interaction between O61 and N5 in the ¯avin is discussed because of the new conformation of this loop.

1. Introduction
Flavodoxins are a class of low-potential electron-transfer proteins found in a variety of microorganisms. They substitute for iron±sulfur proteins such as ferredoxins in iron-de®cient media (LeGall et al., 1979). In other organisms, ¯avodoxins are produced constitutively. Flavodoxins fall into two classes according to their size. The physical properties, such as redox potential, of many of these proteins are well established and the tertiary structure of this protein is known from Clostridium beijerinickii (Ludwig et al., 1997), Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Watenpaugh et al., 1973), Anacystis nidulans (Smith et al., 1983; Drennan et al., 1999), Chondrus crispus (Fukuyama et al., 1992), Anabaena 7120 (Burkhart et al., 1995), Escherichia

coli (Hoover & Ludwig, 1997), Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (Romero et al., 1996) and Megasphaera elsdenii (van Mierlo et al., 1990). These proteins have similar polypeptide folding patterns, with a central -sheet core ¯anked by pairs of -helices. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of electron transfer, the reduced states of the C. beijerinckii (Smith et al., 1977) and D. vulgaris (Watt et al., 1991) ¯avodoxins have been examined by X-ray crystallography. From these studies, a ¯ipping of the peptide chain is found to occur near N5 of the isoalloxazine ring in the reduced states. Since the gene for ¯avodoxin from D. vulgaris has been sequenced and cloned (Krey et al., 1988), a comparison of the mutants of ¯avodoxin has been carried out and the residues believed to be responsible for regulating the redox potential of the semiquinone/hydroquinone redox couple have provided some interesting insights. As most ¯avodoxins have a tyrosine in the FMN-binding site, Tyr98 of the D. vulgaris ¯avodoxin was chosen to be modi®ed (Swenson & Krey, 1994). Reported here are the structures and a comparison with the native structure of two of these mutations as determined by X-ray crystallography. These structures have also been studied using NMR (Stockman et al., 1994). The Y98W mutant diffracted to higher resolution than any of the previously examined ¯avodoxins. Ê With data better than 95% complete to 1.5 A resolution, the quality of the resulting maps allows the study of the ®ne details of the structure with a high degree of con®dence. Precise main-chain and side-chain positions, residues occupying multiple conformations, detailed solvent structure and precise information on the extent of bow of the FMN are presented. The high-resolution data allows the details of the conformational changes believed to be caused by the mutation to be easily observed. no noticeable degradation in the quality of the data during overnight data collection on the area detector. For the highÊ resolution Y98W mutant, the 1.5 A resolution assigned to the Ê structure re¯ects the I/'(I) = 1.0 limit of 1.47 A. Good quality data with I/'(I) values above 2.0 extending to a resolution Ê cutoff of 1.3 A were used in the XTAL and PROLSQ re®nement, while all data except speci®cally identi®ed outliers were used for the anisotropic SHELXL (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) re®nement, as advocated by Sheldrick in the SHELXL manual. The Rmerge for all re¯ections was 0.058 (unweighted absolute R factor on I), with the data being better Ê than 95% complete to 1.5 A resolution.

2. Methods
2.1. Crystallization and data collection

Crystals of Y98H ¯avodoxin were grown from 3.1 M (NH4)2SO4 buffered with 0.1 M Tris±HCl pH 7.5. The Y98W crystals were grown from 3.2 M (NH4)2SO4 buffered with 0.1 M Tris±HCl pH 7.0. Crystals acceptable for diffraction studies were obtained using protein concentrations between 0.8 and 1.0%. Both mutant crystals required a few weeks to a few months to grow to a suitable size for diffraction measurements. The Y98H crystals were generally single, while the Y98W crystals appeared as clusters of rectangular crosssection rods growing from a common nucleation site. In all cases, the Y98W crystals had to be cut for diffraction studies. For each structure, the data were collected from a single crystal. Data for the structure determinations were collected using a Siemens P4/Xentronics area detector with Cu K radiation produced by a Siemens rotating-anode generator and a vertical graphite monochromator. Statistics of data collection are presented in Table 1. All data were collected at room temperature (296 K) and processed with version 2.0 of the XENGEN software package (Howard et al., 1987). Crystals for both mutants were very stable in the X-ray beam, with

The Y98H and Y98W mutant structures were solved using molecular replacement. The oxidized room-temperature structure of native (P2A) D. vulgaris ¯avodoxin (Watt et al., 1991) was used as a probe molecule. The MERLOT system of programs (Fitzgerald, 1988) was used to complete the rotation (Lattman & Love, 1972; Crowther, 1972) and translation (Crowther & Blow, 1967) search as well as to apply the resulting values. Translational solutions were found based on 8' rotation solutions for the Y98H and a single 11' solution for the Y98W mutant. Re®nement for the Y98H mutant utilized PROLSQ (Konnert & Hendrickson, 1980; Sheriff, 1987) on data with I > 2'(I) in a ®nal resolution range of Ê 8±2.0 A, while re®nement of the Y98W mutant utilized CEDAR (Watenpaugh, 1985) as incorporated in the XTAL system of programs (Hall et al., 1992) and PROLSQ for data Ê with I > 2'(I), both in a ®nal resolution range of 20±1.3 A. Anisotropic re®nement with SHELXL included all data in the Ê resolution range 8.0±1.3 A. Model rebuilding was performed initially on an Evans & Sutherland PS390 computer graphics system running FRODO software (Jones, 1985; P¯ugrath et al., 1985) using 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron-density maps and later on an Silicon Graphics Indigo using the programs CHAIN (Sack & Quiocho, 1997) and LORE (Finzel, 1997). All electron-density maps used Sim (1960) weighting in order to reduce aberrant calculated phases from Fourier syntheses. Re®nement of the Y98H mutant was complete after 94 cycles and ®ve rebuilding sessions with data in the resolution Ê range 8±2.0 A and an R factor (I > 2') of 17.4%. The Y98H model incorporates 141 sites for solvent atoms. Solvent atoms were only added when reasonable density appeared in both 2Fo À Fc and difference maps and if at least one hydrogen bond to a donor was present. Occupancies and thermal parameters of the solvent were re®ned in alternating cycles. A summary of the re®nement statistics is shown in Table 1. The atomic coordinates and structure-factor data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000). Re®nement of the Y98W mutant began using CEDAR starting from an 8' translation-search peak. The initial Fc calculation using this model had an R factor of 37% and Ê incorporated data to 2.5 A. CEDAR can re®ne molecular structures using energy minimization and crystallographic techniques either separately or in conjunction with each other.

We have found that it allows rapid inclusion of high-resolution data and in our environment has worked well for looking at small changes in structures such as the binding of different inhibitors to a particular protein. Re®nement with PROLSQ was begun because of dif®culty in modeling some alternate side-chain conformations, particularly Arg131, where the two conformations of the side chain slowly diverge starting from the C, and because of the need to compare ®nal structural statistics with those of the native and Y98H mutant which had been re®ned with PROLSQ. Finally, SHELXL was used because of its ease of speci®cation of alternate con®gurations and ability to re®ne anisotropically. In all cases, re®nement sessions were interspersed with model-building sessions using FRODO or CHAIN with the incorporation of LORE. The ®nal SHELXL model incorporates eight alternate conformation side chains and 273 solvent molecules. Final R factors [I > 2'(I)] from CEDAR, PROLSQ and SHELXL are 16.2, 16.6 and 9.8%, respectively. Crystallographic parameters and ®nal re®nement statistics for all are presented in Table 1.1 Coordinates from the SHELXL model were deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Re®nement with SHELXL was started in part to develop experience with this program and in part to assess the ease with which one could specify and re®ne alternate conformations. Following initial isotropic (conjugate-gradient leastsquares) re®nement, the R factor [I > 2'(I)] stabilized at 15.4% with an Rfree of 20%. This model included eight alternate side chains modeled using the PART I and PART II instructions with different names for the atoms in the alternate chains and SADI to ensure proper geometry. The 1997 SHELXL release removes the need for different atom names, making alternate side-chain speci®cation easier. This isotropic structure included 233 solvent molecules. All re®nements were run without bulk-solvent correction. The SHELXL re®neÊ ment used antibumping restraints of 2.0 A for solvent atoms. At this point, following the procedure outlined in Sheldrick's SHELXL manual, the data were tested to determine whether anisotropic re®nement was justi®ed. The Rfree fell by 2%, a fall of 1% being the suggested decision criterion for proceeding with anisotropic re®nement. With 147 residues and the FMN, we carried out the anisotropic re®nement in block mode, specifying blocks of about 15 residues overlapping by four or ®ve residues with adjacent blocks. Completion of the ®rst successful run brought the R factor to 12.7%. The data-toparameter ratio for this anisotropic re®nement was 24 812:12 790 or about 2:1. Further cycles of modeling and re®nement brought the R factor to 11.2%. At this point, calculated H atoms were added which further reduced the R factor. Model building and further re®nement, including addition of more solvent aided by the solvent-suggestion routines built into SHELXL, resulted in an R factor below 10%. To remove any possible artifacts caused by block re®nement, a ®nal run of four cycles of conjugate-gradient

least-squares re®nement on the whole structure was performed. The ®nal model has R factors of 9.8% [I > 2'(I)] and 12.7% (all data) and an Rfree of 16.8% (all data). Inclusion Ê of data to 1.3 A, even though the average I/'(I) for this shell is less than unity, was driven by the large number of observed Ê re¯ections and re¯ections above 2' for the 1.5±1.3 A shell. Of the theoretical 18 242 re¯ections, 13 450 were observed and 26% of these, or 3531, had intensities of 2' or greater. The 2'

Final re®nement showed that the hydrogen-bonding scheme (Table 2) of the ribityl and phosphate groups of the FMN showed little change between the native and mutants; however, the hydrogen-bonding network around the FMN is somewhat different. Both mutant structures showed slight bending in the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN. The angle between the plane normals of the two outer rings is 7.5 (Y98H) and 7.4 (Y98W), respectively.

Ê 18.8 A2, respectively, and those based on calculated isotropic Bs generated for the anisotropic model of the Y98W mutant Ê by SHELXL are 20.0, 13.0 and 39.5 A2, respectively. The general difference in these values is felt to be one caused by program differences in approach to temperature-factor re®nement and scaling. The large discrepancy for the solvent molecules re¯ects the additional weaker solvent assignments made in the anisotropic phase of re®nement and the strategy in SHELXL of creating a web of fully occupied solvent molecules with higher temperature factors. For the purposes of further discussion and structural comparison with the native protein, the SHELXL model of Y98W has been used.
3.3. Comparison of mutant and native structures

The overall quality of the Y98W and Y98H structures was assessed with the PROCHECK program (Laskowski et al., 1993). Table 1 summarizes the assessment of the Y98H mutant structure as well as ®nal CEDAR, PROLSQ and SHELXL determined models for the Y98W mutant. Also presented in this table are the corresponding parameters for the native (P2A) form of the protein. In using PROCHECK for the Y98W structures, multiple conformations were not considered and the models were modi®ed to have only single side-chain conformations placed in the conformation of highest occupancy. It is clear from the similarity of the end models and the PROCHECK assessment that all three programs arrived at fully satisfactory models for the Y98W mutant of the protein. Comparison of temperature factors between the different mutant models shows the expected correlation of low relative temperature factor for the -sheet core of the protein as well as the expected higher temperature factors for the -helices and -turns which mostly comprise the surface of the protein. The average temperature (B) factors for the protein atoms, FMN atoms and water molecules from the PROLSQ model of Ê the Y98H mutant are 13.5, 8.0 and 18.7 A2, respectively, while those for Y98W obtained from PROLSQ were 14.4, 8.9, and

A superposition of Y98W on Y98H based on alignment generated by SUPERIMP (Honzatko, 1986) indicated an Ê average r.m.s. difference for the main-chain atoms of 0.31 A, Ê . The main regions of while that of the side chains is 1.05 A differences in the two structures are shown in Fig. 2. Table 3 summarizes the results of similar superpositions of the Y98H mutant with the oxidized and semiquinone forms of the native and of the Y98W mutant on both forms of the native. As demonstrated by the results from SUPERIMP, overall the mutant structures are more similar to each other than to the native forms of the protein. Comparison of the Ramachandran angles for the peptide chain 60±64 of the two mutants to those of the native structures (Table 4) indicates a greater similarity of the mutants, in this loop region, to the semi-reduced state than to the oxidized form of the native. In all three cases (Y98H, Y98W and semi-reduced native), the 60±64 loop is con®gured so that O61 points generally toward N5 of the FMN. This con®guration, referred to as the `O-up' con®guration, is seen in many semi-reduced forms of a variety of both long- and short-chain ¯avodoxins (Smith et al., 1977; Watt et al., 1991; Ludwig et al., 1997; Hoover et al., 1999). Figs. 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) show stereoviews of this loop region including residues 61, 62, surrounding solvent and N5 of the FMN for the native oxidized, native semi-reduced, Y98H and Y98W forms of the protein. Although Wat155 appeared in all three oxidation states of the native, bridging O4 of the FMN to O62 and N100 (Watt et al., 1991), this scheme has changed for the two mutants. In Y98H, two waters, Wat231 and Wat172, appear in the vicinity of Wat155 of the native; their presence might arise from reordering owing to the greater solvent-accessible volume. In Y98W, Wat203, Wat220 and Wat208 appear in this same region, indicating a completely different hydrogen-bonding scheme.

Ê are 4.19 and 4.08 A for the Y98H and Y98W mutants, respectively. An indirect or bridging hydrogen bond through Wat203 in the Y98W or the equivalent solvent molecule in the Y98H structure is non-ideal because of the observed geometry and distances (O61ÐWat203ÐN5 angle less than 90 , Ê Wat203ÐN5 distance is 3.22 A in Y98W). Considering the Ê large number of hydrogen-acceptor groups (four within 3.0 A) and the electrostatically negative environment, it appears likely that Wat203 might be an ammonium ion rather than a water molecule. In the re®ned structure, this site is represented by a fully occupied O atom and has a quite reasonable Ê temperature factor of 11 A2 (Fig. 3d). The 60s loop is two residues longer than the corresponding loops in other ¯avodoxins; this difference might allow greater ¯exibility for interacting with other electron-transport proteins. Mutation of residue 61 to alanine (G61A; O'Farrell et al., 1998) results in a large shift in the ox/sq potential (E2) and a large movement of this loop, which may be necessary to remove bad contacts introduced by the mutation. This large loop movement is not observed if the glycine residue equivalent to Gly61 is mutated to Ala, Asp or Asn in the shorter-looped ¯avodoxin C. beijerinckii (O'Farrell et al., 1998; Ludwig et al., 1997). A comparison of these three structures (Y98W, G61A and C. beijerinckii) is shown in Fig. 4. Because of the several conformations of the 60s loop in the D. vulgaris mutants (Tyr98, Gly61), it appears that there are only small energy differences between them as suggested for the corresponding loop region in ¯avodoxin from C. beijerinckii (Ludwig et al., 1997). A correlation between the hydrogen bond to N5 and the redox potential for E2 has been discussed based on a small data set (Fukuyama et al., 1992). That is, in the native D. vulgaris and C. beijerinckii proteins (E2 of À102 and À92 mV, respectively), a new hydrogen bond is formed upon reduction to the semiquinone state. However, in Chondrus crispus and Anabaena 7120 (E2 of À235 and À196 mV, respectively) a hydrogen bond exists in the oxidized state. The E2 for the D. vulgaris ¯avodoxin of À102mV is higher than the À146mV value subsequently reported (Curley et al., 1991). The Y98H and Y98W mutants of the D. vulgaris

protein have E2 values of À175 and À152 mV, respectively (Table 5) (Swenson et al., 1991). Both Y98W and Y98H mutants show the peptide chain already oriented for a hydrogen-bond interaction with N5 (albeit an indirect one) in the oxidized state. It appears that this chain reorientation and hydrogen-bond formation might be in place so that the formation of the semiquinone is stabilized to allow the value of E2 in the D. vulgaris system to increase. However, the hydrogen-bond distance is too long in the oxidized state for these two mutants and the crucial experiment to determine the effects of this hydrogen bond would be to study the reduced structures of these mutants and determine whether there is an adjustment bringing O61 closer to N5. A comparison of the NMR order parameters with B factors from the X-ray structure of the oxidized and reduced protein shows higher values for the reduced form compared with the oxidized form, especially throughout the 55±63 and 92±103 loop regions (Hrovat et al., 1997). When examining this same region of the Y98W and Y98H mutants, there is an increase in B factors in the 60±66 and 96±100 regions, with averages of 20 Ê Ê and 18 A2 for Y98H, and 19 and 17 A2 for Y98W, respectively. This can be compared with the average B factor for the Ê Ê protein of 13.5 A2 for Y98H and 14.4 A2 for Y98W. Although the B values for these loop regions are higher, there are no intermolecular contacts that in¯uence this region. The chain following Trp98 also exhibits some displacement, which at ®rst glance appears to be sterically driven to accommodate the larger Trp side chain (Fig. 3). However, this displacement also occurs in the Y98H mutant, with its smaller side chain. The latter would seem to imply that additional structural studies of other mutant structures at Tyr98 might reveal the nature of what is driving this movement. The environment of the isoalloxazine ring is somewhat different in each of the mutants of D. vulgaris. Since Tyr98 is coplanar with the outer portion of the ¯avin ring, there is a possibility that charge-transfer transition could occur between the %-clouds of the two ring systems. When this residue is substituted with tryptophan and histidine using standard point-mutagenesis methods, a slight change in redox potential for E2 in the ®rst case and a signi®cant change for the second case are observed (Table 5) (Swenson et al., 1991). Although the conformations of the Y98W and Y98H mutants appear similar, the His mutant exhibits signi®cant redox-potential differences in E2 when compared with the native. This could be a result of electrostatic effects with the ¯avin semiquinone since the two aromatic ring systems are different. The Y98W and Y98H mutants, when compared with the wild type, show a slight change in the E1 in the ®rst case and a large change in the second case (Table 5). Swenson & Krey (1994) have observed a linear dependence of the ox/sq couple (E2) on pH over the range 5.5 to almost 9.0 (ca $60 mV per pH-unit increase) for the Y98H variant. They conclude that if titration of the imidazole ring occurs over this pH range, then there would appear to be no preferred interactions between either the neutral or the protonated forms of the histidine with the neutral ¯avin semiquinone in this variant. For the sq/hq couple, an approximate 180 mV electropotential increase relative to the wild type is observed at pH 7, but above pH 6 the potential begins to decrease with increasing pH. From these studies, Swenson & Krey suggest that stabilization of the hydroquinone anion by the positively charged histidine, less shielding of the ¯avin from solvent and favorable electrostatic interactions might account for the large difference in E1 for the Y98H variant.
3.4. Details of the high-resolution Y98W mutant structure

3.4.1. Alternate conformations. As a result of the highresolution data for the Y98W mutant, several residues occupying multiple conformations have been identi®ed. For the purpose of r.m.s. comparison with the native, the mutant conformation with the highest occupancy was chosen. The residues that required multiple conformations were Arg24, Glu25, Ser35, Ser40, Val88, Ser97, Ile126 and Arg131. With the exception of Val88 and Ile126, these residues all lie on the surface of the protein. A representative view of Val88 with electron density is shown in Fig. 5. Occupancies for all residues exhibiting multiple conformation were re®ned and alternate conformations were generally not equally populated. 3.4.2. The flavin. The quality of the electron-density map for the Y98W mutant is displayed in Fig. 6, which gives two views of the FMN group. The 2Fo À Fc map is contoured at a level of 1' and clearly indicates the position of all non-H atoms for the FMN. The second view clearly shows that the FMN rings are bowed as has been suggested previously (Smith et al., 1977; Massey & Hemmerich, 1980; Watt et al., 1991). Although both mutant structures appear to have a bow in the FMN ring structure, as did the native structure, it is only with high-resolution data that one feels comfortable in calculating a reliable bow angle for the rings. At this resolution, the amount of bow can be calculated as 7.4 . From a survey of 55 ¯avins (Lennon & Ludwig, 1999), the average of 7.0 Æ 5.2 for oxidized ¯avins and 8.2 Æ 5.9 for reduced ¯avins is in good agreement with what we have Figure 4 observed.

XTAL system, was generated by calculating the angle between least-squares planes determined from the atoms in the end rings of the FMN and represents the overall FMN bow, not a deviation of individual atoms of the FMN from planarity. The angle may be underestimated because planarity restraints in the re®nement result in a slightly more planar geometry of the FMN than the 2Fo À Fc electron density appears to indicate. As this angle is calculated for a mutant structure, it may not re¯ect the degree of bow of the native but may rather be a product of the changes caused by the mutation or crystal packing. The latter seems somewhat less likely owing to the buried nature of the FMN.

4. Conclusions
The re®nement of the Y98H and Y98W mutants of ¯avodoxin provides some insights into the redox potentials of the system. The redox potentials for the Y98W mutant are very similar to those of the native, while the structure in the region of the FMN, particularly near N5, has changed considerably. It would appear that the redox potential E2 is relatively unperturbed by changes in the conformation of the oxidized ¯avodoxin that result from the mutations Y98H and Y98W. The high resoluFigure 6

tion of the Y98W structure coupled with the ability to complete anisotropic re®nement using SHELXL allows the generation of maps of suf®cient quality to look at solvent structure, assign multiple conformations to side chains and to study with some con®dence the planarity and interactions of the FMN. The movements in response to the mutations appear to require the protein to crystallize in different lower symmetry space groups. Finally, as stated earlier, study of the reduced structures of these mutants would be useful for determining whether there is a conformational change bringing O61 closer to N5 and how the large differences observed in E1 for the Y98H mutant are related to structure.
