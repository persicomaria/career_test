Azurin*, a by-product of heterologous expression of the gene encoding the blue copper protein azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Escherichia coli, was characterized by chemical analysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and its structure determined by X-ray crystallography. It was shown that azurin* is native azurin with its copper atom replaced by zinc in the metal binding site. Zinc is probably incorporated in the apo-protein after its expression and transport into the periplasm. Holo-azurin can be reconstituted from azurin* by prolonged exposure of the protein to high copper ion concentrations or unfolding of the protein and refolding in the presence of copper ions. An X-ray crystallographic analysis of azurin* at 0.21-nm resolution revealed that the overall structure of azurin is not perturbed by the metal exchange. However, the geometry of the co-ordination sphere changes from trigonal bipyramidal in the case of copper azurin to distorted tetrahedral for the zinc protein. The copper ligand Met121 is no longer co-ordinated to zinc which adopts a position close to the carbonyl oxygen atom from residue Gly45. The polypeptide structure surrounding the metal site undergoes moderate reorganization upon zinc binding. The largest displacement observed is for the carbonyl oxygen from residue Gly45, whch is involved in copper and zinc binding. It moves by 0.03 nm towards the zinc, thereby reducing its distance to the metal from 0.29 nm in the copper protein to 0.23 nm in the derivative.

Binding of metals to proteins is generally assumed to be a highly selective process. Selectivity of cation uptake in biological systems may be achieved through various mechanisms, including control of metal concentrations via homeostasis, special cation carriers and, most importantly, high-affinity binding to the target metalloprotein both in terms of kinetics and thermodynamics (Frausto da Silva and Williams, 1976; Williams, 1982, 1983; Hamer and Winge, 1989). For azurin ( M , = 14000), a single-copper-containing protein that serves as an electron-transfer agent in denitrifying bacteria (Adman, 1985), metal-substitution experiments have been performed with a variety of transition metal ions and the properties of the native protein have been compared in detail with those of the derivatives. It has been shown that under comparable conditions, Cu(I1) was taken up by apo-azurin much more rapidly than Ni(II), Co(I1) and Mn(I1) (Tennent and McMillin, 1979).

Thermal denaturation studies suggested that, in comparison to other first row divalent transition metal ions like Zn(II), Cu(I1) binds more strongly to apo-azurin, resulting in the highest denaturation enthalpy for Cu(I1)-azurin (Engeseth and McMillin, 1986). In the past, the purity of azurin preparations has been of concern to various groups working on its spectroscopy (Grinvald et al., 1975; Szabo et al., 1983; Canters et al., 1984; Petrich et al., 1987; Hutnik and Szabo, 1989; van de Kamp et al., 1990). It was shown that azurin samples may contain a contaminating protein which co-purifies with azurin and cannot easily be distinguished from the latter. It was suggested that the impurity consists of an azurin-like protein that can not be reconstituted with Cu(I1) (Petrich et al., 1987; Hutnik and Szabo, 1989). Recently, the gene encoding azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cloned (Canters, 1987; Arvidsson et al., 1989) and the protein expressed in high yields in Escherichia cofi (Karlsson et al.. 1989). The high yield of over-expressed azurin from E. Cali and the development of a new isolation procedure made it possible to isolate the contaminating byproduct, which was called azurin* (van de Kamp et al., 1990).

1124 'H-NMR spectroscopic and electrophoretic characterization demonstrated that this protein is highly similar to the Cuazurin, but was not the oxidized, reduced or apo-form of azurin. From experimental evidence that azurin* could not readily incorporate copper ions, it was tentatively concluded that some chemical modification might be present at the metalbinding site of azurin*. but its real nature could not be identified. In this paper we describe the systematic chemical, spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of azurin* and will show that azurin* is the zinc derivative of native azurin which is probably formed in E. coli under the bacterial growth conditions.The structural results are presented and the physiological relevance of the findings discussed.

ES mass spectra (Fig. 1) were recorded for each of the three species separated by HPLC. The molecular mass of the protein in the major fraction was found to be 13946.09 k 0.45 Da, that of peaks 2 and 3 13962.05 f 1.39 Da and 13962.73 0.93 Da. A comparison with the calculated mass of apo-azurin, 13943.79 Da, shows that the molecular mass of the peak 1 sample is, within the limits of expected error of this method, identical to unmodified azurin. Peaks 2 and 3 may represent azurin species in which methonine oxidation has occurred at two distinct sites in the sequence (molecular mass difference 16 Da). To probe further for a modified cysteine in the active site of azurin*, cysteine titration with 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was employed. The protein content of the azurin* solution was determined by measuring the 280-nm protein absorption band and using = 9800 M-' cm-' (van de Kamp et al., 1990). 6.6 nmol protein was titrated yielding 6.2 nmol (96.3%) free cysteine. After it was established that there was no covalent modification of Cysll2 present in azurin*, we obtained initial electron density maps of crystals of azurin* which indicated the presence of a 'heavy' atom in the active site of the protein (see below). We concluded that there was another metal bound in azurin*. Because of the absence of any features in the visible absorption spectrum, the diamagnetism of azurin* and because of its ubiquitous nature, zinc was proposed to be this metal. This hypothesis was tested by AAS on a 30 mM azurin* sample (38.6 nmol), which was found to contain 36.2 nmol (93.7%) zinc. Keeping in mind the probable error of about 10% in the determination of the protein content using the derived value for cZBO.we deduce from these results that the stoichlometric ratio of Zn2+ and azurin is 1 : 1 in azurin'.

RESULTS
Chemical and spectroscopic characterization The experiments described in this section were designed to probe for a possible covalent modification (van de Kamp et al., 1990) at the active site of azurin*. Oxidation of Cysll2 to cysteic acid should be manifested in an altered amino acid composition when comparing azurin and azurin*. In addition, an extra three oxygen atoms should be. detectable using ESMS, a highly sensitive method for molecular mass determination. Other covalent modifications involving Cysll2, such as the formation of a thioether bridge between Cysll2 and Hisll7, should result in the failure to titrate a free cysteine in denatured azurin*. Reversed-phase HPLC run on azurin* revealed that the sample consists of three species in the ratio 85:10:5 with very similar retention times on the column. The amino acid composition of the major fraction was found to be identical to that of azurin. Peaks corresponding to cysteic acid were absent from the analyte (results not shown).

Copper ions can be incorporated into Zn-azurin simply by exposing the latter to a moderate excess of Cu(I1) in the surrounding medium. With a 100-fold excess of Cu(II), 10% zinc displacement was observed after four days, 35% after four weeks. Using a 10-fold excess of copper ions, the typical absorption band at 628 nm appeared in the spectrum after 8 - 10 weeks of incubation at room temperature. After 20 weeks 67% of the protein was reconstituted. Some loss of protein, probably due to denaturation, was observed. No displacement of Cu(I1) from holo-azurin occurs upon exposure of the protein to a 100-fold excess of Zn(I1) under the same conditions. Copper incorporation into Zn-azurin can be accelerated by denaturation of the protein followed by renaturation in the presence of excess Cu(I1). Reconstitution was achieved by stepwise dilution of the solution containing the denaturation agent and the protein. Substantial recovery (>6O%) of the blue copper absorption band was observed at 1 M guanidinium chloride. As a control experiment, the same procedure was applied to Cu-azurin. In this case, the yield of reconstituted azurin was >65%. While preparing this paper, we learnt that a similar procedure has been applied successfully by Hibino et al. (1991) to incorporate copper into recombinant Silene pratensis apo-plastocyanin. Cu(I1) binding to apo-azurin occurs on a much faster time-scale than Zn(I1) binding. Exposure of apo-azurin to a threefold excess of both Cu(I1) and Zn(I1) produced > 95% Cu(I1)-azurin, a value which is indistinguishable from the control experiment [apo-azurin reconstituted only with Cu(I1)

A large positive peak close to Cysll2 Sy implies some positional shift for this atom following the direction of the shift of the metal ion.

Main differences are the deviations of atomic ie) positions of Gly45 backbone atoms ( > 0.03 nm), Cysll2 backbone and side-chain atoms (>0.02 nm) and the metal ions (0.03 nm). These shifts arejust above the error estimated from a Luzzati plot (0.02 nm). However, the error for the region around the metal-binding site as judged from the consistency found between the four independent monomers in the asymmetric unit of azurin crystals is only about 0.01 nm. Therefore, we conclude that the structural differences seen are significant. The remainder of the azurin molecule is virtually unchanged upon metal replacement.

After establishing the nature of the bound hetero-atom, X-Ray crystallographic work on Zn-azurin was initiated concurrently with the chemical and spectroscopic analyses the emphasis of the structure analysis was put on a comparison described above. The hypothesis that another metal atom was between the binding modes of the two metals in the azurin bound in place of the copper in azurin* was based partly on active site. A superposition of the refined structures of Znthe first electron density map, computed with coefficients azurin and Cu-azurin (Fig. 3) shows that indeed the metal F,(azurin*) -F,(azurin) (where azurin refers to the wild-type exchange has only very localized structural effects.

This distance is 0.31 nm in Cu-azurin and is generally regarded as a weak bonding interaction (Adman, 1985; Baker, 1988). The arrangement of the four ligands around the zinc is distorted tetrahedral (Fig. 4) as opposed to the distorted trigonal bipyramidal arrangement in Cu-azurin. Zinc binding to azurin causes a structural adjustment of the polypeptide atoms in its immediate surroundings (Fig. 3). Significant shifts are observed for residues 44 and 45. In particular, 0 4 5 moves 0.03 nm toward the zinc. Movement of Cysll2 Sy and backbone atoms (0.02 nm) is observed and consistent with the peak pattern in the difference density map as seen in Fig. 2.

structures of the apo-protein (Garrett et al., 1984) and the Hg(I1)-derivatized (Church et al., 1986) forms are hardly changed with respect to the Cu(I1) structure. These contrasting results are probably due to structural differences between the copper-binding sites in plastocyanin, where copper is bound in a distorted tetrahedral fashion [such that no geometric change has to occur in replacing it by Hg(I1) which prefers a tetrahedral coordination sphere], and azurin, where a distorted trigonal bipyramidal site is present. Although zinc coordination by Cys, His and oxygen donor ligands is quite common in zinc enzyme structures known to date (Vallee and Auld, 1990), the mixed N 2 S 0 coordination sphere in Zn-azurin is novel. The closest relation may be found with the catalytic zinc site in alcohol dehydrogenase (Branden et al., 1975) where two Cys, one His and a water molecule are arranged in a distorted tetrahedron around the metal centre. Bond distances and angles in Zn-azurin (Fig. 4) are well within the range observed in other crystallographically characterized Zn sites (Chakrabarti, 1989, 1990a). Structural data for metal sites involving ligation of main-chain carbonyl groups are abundant for calcium, but rare for other metals. In fact, the only known examples are azurin (copper) and leucine aminopeptidase (zinc; Burley et al., 1990). In the latter, one of the two active-site zinc ions is coordinated both by the side-chain carboxylate and the main-chain carbonyl group of an aspartic acid residue. Additional carbonyl -zinc interactions are found in several complexes with peptide inhibitors of the hydrolytic enzymes carboxypeptidase A (Christiansson and Lipscomb, 1986) and thermolysin (Holmes and Matthews, 1981; Holmes et al., 1983). It is evident from these examples that zinc is bound to a carbonyl group only in a bidentate mode, realized when an additional ligand atom is available from the same or a neighbouring amino acid (Chakrabarti, 1990b). T h s bonding pattern is seen in Zn-azurin also, where Gly45 0 and His46 N6 form an eight-membered ring chelate with the metal. Spectroscopic data Zn-azurin, then called azurin*, has previously been characterized by gel electrophoresis, ultraviolet/visible absorption, 'H-NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy (van de Kamp et al., 1990). From the presence of twinned peaks in its proton NMR spectrum, it was suggested that it might occur in two forms, azurin *a and azurin *b, with azurin *a being the predominant species ( > 9 5 % ) . It could be suggested that azurin*b corresponds to one of the minor azurin * components detected by ES-MS, with the copper ligand Met121 being oxidized to the sulfoxide and thus preventing metal incorporation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that oxidation of surface Met residues during protein storage might have occurred for part of the protein sample. The following electrophoretic and spectroscopic properties of azurin* are compatible with the finding that it is Zn-azurin. The proton spectrum indicates that the protein is diamagnetic, in line with the diamagnetic character of Zn(1I). Neither oxidative treatment with ferricyanide nor reduction with dithionite affects azurin* as expected for the redox inert Zn(I1). The observation that azurin* is more thermo-stable than Cu- and apo-azurin correlates with previously reported melting temperatures for Zn(II), Cu(I1) and apo-azurin of 90 "C, 80 "C and 62 "C, respectively (Engeseth and McMillin, 1986). The pK, values of titratable histidines in azurin are sensitive probes of the charge on the metal active site (Groeneveld et al., 1988; Bashford et al., 1988). The pK, of

DISCUSSION

Zn binding to azurin ic
According to the rack-induced bonding concept (Gray and Malmstrom, 1983), the bound metal ion in metalloproteins is forced to adopt a coordination geometry determined by the rigid peptide conformation. The structure of Zn-azurin reported here shows that, although the tight cluster of hydrogen bonding around the metal site in azurin prevents drastic conformational changes in the protein structure, it nevertheless allows for some distortions at the polypeptide backbone and side-chain atoms. The largest difference between Zn-azurin and Cu-azurin is at Gly45 0, which forms a weak bond (0.29 nm) with Cu but a strong bond (0.23 nm) with Zn. The movement of this atom and the slight adjustment of backbone atoms connected to it is probably induced by the preference of Zn for tetrahedral coordination. If one assumes that the protein in Cu-azurin is in a relaxed conformation (i. e. identical to apo-azurin ; Baker, 1991), the limited but distinct flexibility of the azurin binding site seen here suggests a higher metalbinding energy than the conformational energy needed to induce these distortions in the peptide structure. Baker (1991) has found similar effects when studying the Cd(I1) derivative of Alcaligenes denitrzfcans azurin. For the related blue copper protein plastocyanin, in contrast, the

1128 His35 in azurin* (6.3 f 0.2) is found close to that of Cu(I1)azurin (6.5 f 0.2), but differs from that of Cu(1)-azurin (7.2 f 0.1) as expected for the charge + 2 of Zn in azurin*. Finally, the much higher fluorescence yield of azurin* compared to Cu(I1)-azurin is in agreement with the inability of Zn(I1) to quench tryptophan fluorescence effectively (Engeseth, 1983). However, the reported titratability of Hisl 17 deduced from NMR spectroscopy is incompatible with the Zn . ..NS Hisl 17 bond observed in the crystal structure. Careful reexamination of the NMR spectra has made it clear that the pHdependent behaviour of His117 can be explained by the influence of the titration of His35 on His117 resonances, since His117 and His35 have similar pK, (6.6 f 0.5 and 6.3 f 0.2) and for both residues the same exchange regime is obtained. By analogy with similar observations for other ligand resonances (Adman et al., 1982; Canters et al., 1984; van de Kamp et al., 1990) we conclude that His117 in Zn-azurin is not titratable itself, but that its pH dependence reflects the titration of His35 through small conformational effects. copper vs zinc uptake is regulated in the cell by metal homeostasis (Williams, 1983, 1985; Hamer and Winge, 1989) resulting in higher Cu(I1) than Zn(I1) levels in the periplasmic spaces of the native organisms Pseudomonas aeruginosa and A . denitrijicans, allowing selective copper incorporation into azurin upon translocation over the cytoplasmic membrane. Enhanced Zn incorporation into these proteins, when isolated from E. coli, would then reflect differences in metal homeostasis. Furthermore, over-expression of foreign protein-encoding genes in E. colimight disturb metal homeostasis. Another explanation would be the involvement of metalspecific carrier proteins that mediate effective copper transfer in vivo in the native organisms. Evidence for the existence of such copper-processing proteins has been provided in the case of the periplasmic nitrous oxide reductase from Pseiidomonas stutzeri (Zumft et al., 1990). Using this line of reasoning, the observed ratios of isolated Cu-protein Zn-protein from E. coli cells might merely reflect the absence of such carrier proteins. This would be understandable, as in the heterologous expression experiments only the blue copper protein-encoding genes are transferred to E. coli without any possible helper genes.

Zinc vs copper binding
The metal-exchange experiments have shown that zinc binding to azurin creates an activation barrier which makes copper incorporation into Zn-azurin an extremely slow process with half-lives of several days. On the other hand, copper binding to Zn-azurin is a thermodynamically favoured process. Competition experiments indicate that zinc binding to azurin is much slower than copper binding, implying that Cu is preferred by azurin as the incorporated cofactor not only thermodynamically but also via kinetic control. These findings agree with the assumption that azurin selectively binds copper (Williams, 1982, 1983; Blaszak et al., 1983; Engeseth and McMillin, 1986). Since there is no difference in ionic radii [73 pm for Cu(II), 74pm for Zn(II)] and charge between the two cations, the selectivity in the absence of metal-specific carriers probably lies in different stereochemical demands and Lewis acidity. A comparison of the crystallographically determined structures of Cu-azurin (Nar et al., 1991) and Zn-azurin shows that zinc incorporation into the azurin active site leads to the formation of four strong bonds in a flattened tetrahedral array with some distortion of the polypeptide structure. Therefore, it appears that the azurin metal site is tailored for copper binding since it offers three strong equatorial ligands and two weakly bound axial ligands. However, it should be kept in mind that, while the present discussion focusses on the incorporation of Cu(I1) ions. it might be Cu(1) which is used by the organism to constitute holo-azurin in vivo. Apparently, the organisms from which azurin is naturally isolated succeed in favouring the production of holo-protein over Zn-protein (Parr et al., 1976; Norris et al., 1979). As a consequence of the above discussion, the question arises why one observes considerable enhancement of Znazurin production over that of Cu-azurin when the genes encoding azurin are heterologously over-expressed in E. coli (van de Kamp et al., 1990; Hoitink and Canters, unpublished results). The amount of Zn protein may be as large as three times that of the copper protein (den Blaauwen, unpublished) and there are indications that the Cu-azurin/Zn-azurin ratio depends on bacterial growth time after induction (Hoitink and Canters, unpublished results) which suggests that zinc is incorporated while the apoprotein resides in the periplasm. It may be deduced that the incorporation of copper is possibly regulated in vivo. One conceivable mechanism is that
