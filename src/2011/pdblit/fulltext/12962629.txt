An isopullulanase (IPU) from Aspergillus niger ATCC9642 hydrolyzes -1,4glucosidic linkages of pullulan to produce isopanose. Although IPU does not hydrolyze dextran, it is classified into glycoside hydrolase family 49 (GH49), major members of which are dextran-hydrolyzing enzymes. IPU is highly glycosylated, making it difficult to obtain its crystal. We used endoglycosidase Hf to cleave the N-linked oligosaccharides of IPU, and we here determined the unliganded and isopanose-complexed forms of IPU, both solved at 1.7-Å resolution. IPU is composed of domains N and C joined by a short linker, with electron density maps for 11 or 12 N-acetylglucosamine residues per molecule. Domain N consists of 13 -strands and forms a -sandwich. Domain C, where the active site is located, forms a right-handed -helix, and the lengths of the pitches of each coil of the -helix are similar to those of GH49 dextranase and GH28 polygalacturonase. The entire structure of IPU resembles that of a GH49 enzyme, Penicillium minioluteum dextranase (Dex49A), despite a difference in substrate specificity. Compared with the active sites of IPU and Dex49A, the amino acid residues participating in subsites + 2 and + 3 are not conserved, and the glucose residues of isopanose bound to IPU completely differ in orientation from the corresponding glucose residues of isomaltose bound to Dex49A. The shape of the catalytic cleft characterized by the seventh coil of the -helix and a loop from domain N appears to be critical in determining the specificity of IPU for pullulan.

Introduction
Pullulan, a polysaccharide produced by Aureobasidium pullulans, is a linear polymer of maltotriose units joined by -1,6-glucosidic linkages.1 This polysaccharide is used in various fields, including the food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries.2

Because of a unique repeat of -1,4- and -1,6glucosidic linkages, pullulan has also been used to study the substrate specificities of many glycoside hydrolases. Although most -amylases scarcely hydrolyze pullulan, a few are reported to catalyze the hydrolysis of -1,4- or -1,6-glucosidic linkages of pullulan.3­5 Isopullulanase (IPU; EC 3.2.1.57, pullulan 4glucanohydrolase) was found in Aspergillus niger ATCC9642 as an endo-acting pullulan-hydrolyzing enzyme.6 IPU is an anomer-inverting enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes specific -1,4-glucosidic linkages of pullulan to produce isopanose [Glc-(1  4)-Glc--(1  6)-Glc]. To date, IPU is the sole enzyme reported to produce isopanose from pullulan. IPU has been classified into glycoside hydrolase family 49 (GH49). Interestingly, IPU does not

hydrolyze dextran, but an important GH49 enzyme hydrolyzes -1,6-glucosidic linkages of dextran.7­9 Some GH49 endodextranases have been isolated from bacteria and fungi, such as Arthrobacter globiformis T-3044,10 Arthrobacter sp. CB-8,11 Penicil-

lium minioluteum12 and Penicillium funiculosum(DNA Data Bank of Japan/European Molecular Biology Laboratory/GenBank No. AJ272066), and the crystal structure of P. minioluteum dextranase (Dex49A) has recently been determined.13 Dextran 1,6--isomalto-

212 triosidase from Brevibacterium fuscum var. dextranlyticum is an exo-type GH49 enzyme that hydrolyzes dextran from the nonreducing end to produce isomaltotriose.14 The catalytic domain of Dex49A, which shows a 38% identity and a 55% similarity of amino acid sequence with IPU, has been reported to fold into a right-handed parallel -helix.13 This unique fold was first reported in pectate lyase C15 and has been found in GH28, GH49 and GH82.13,16 Polygalacturonases and rhamnogalacturonases consist of similar -helical structures,17,18 although these enzymes are completely different from dextran and pullulan hydrolases in substrate specificity. In addition to its unique substrate specificity, IPU is characterized as a highly N-glycosylated protein.19 The amino acid sequence of IPU contains 15 potential N-linked glycosylation motifs (Asn-XSer/Thr), while Dex49A has only 2. Heterologous expression systems using Aspergillus oryzae and Pichia pastoris as host organisms were constructed.20 Based on the results of electrophoresis, the carbohydrate content was 12­15% (native IPU), 34% (recombinant IPU from A. oryzae) or 41% (recombinant IPU from Pi. pastoris).19,21 The deglycosylation of these enzymes by peptide-N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase Hf (Endo Hf) resulted in a decrease in the activity and stability of IPU.21 Numerous N-linked oligosaccharides, however, make it difficult to obtain the crystal of IPU. We used Endo Hf to cleave the N-linked oligosaccharides of IPU, and we here determined the three-dimensional structure of the unliganded IPU and the form in complex with the product, isopanose. The results indicated that the structure of the active site of IPU markedly differs from that of GH49 dextranase, providing insight into the diversity of the substrate specificity of -helical proteins.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure of IPU The crystal structure of the unliganded IPU has been determined at 1.7-Å resolution (Fig. 1). The crystal belongs to the space group P212121, which contains two molecules (Mol-1 and Mol-2) and 1273 water molecules in an asymmetric unit (Table 1). A Ramachandran plot was calculated with the program PROCHECK of CCP4 suite;24 two residues, Ala395 and Trp402, were found in the disallowed region, yet electron densities for these residues were well defined. The residues from Pro193 to Pro196 adopt a backbone that differs slightly between Mol-1 and Mol-2. The r.m.s.d. from Pro193 to Pro196 between Mol-1 and Mol-2 is 4.2 Å, which is the most significant difference; this region consists of a part of a linker connecting the two domains as described in detail below. Except for this region, the two structures are almost identical, and the overall r.m. s.d. between the two molecules is 0.70 Å for all protein atoms and 0.49 Å for main-chain atoms. To

facilitate the description of IPU, the following is based on Mol-1. Other than electron density for amino acid residues and water molecules, electron density maps for 11 and 12 of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues are seen in Mol-1 and Mol-2, respectively (Table 2). IPU consists of two domains, domain N (residues 20­182) and domain C (residues 197­564), which are joined by a short linker (residues 183­196). Four amino acid residues at the N-terminus (residues 16­19) are artificially introduced residues derived from the signal sequence of the expression plasmid.20 Domain N consists of 13 -strands, 9 of which participate in the formation of a -sandwich structure. This -sandwich architecture is known as an immunoglobulin fold and is widely observed in cell-adhesion proteins and some carbohydratedegrading enzymes.25 Domain N of IPU is highly homologous to the -sandwich domain of Dex49A [residues 3­201 of Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1OGM], with 0.77 Å r.m.s.d. for the C backbone (Fig. 2a). However, two loops, connected between the 4th and the 5th -strands (designated as loop NA, residues 84­94) and between the 11th and the 12th -strands (residues 167­168), are significantly different, and the equivalent loops in Dex49A are identified as residues 67­97 (loop NA) and residues 173­184 (designated loop NB). Loop NA orients to the cavity formed by domain N and contributes to the formation of the catalytic cleft of IPU, while the region corresponding to loop NB of Dex49A is largely lacking in IPU.

213 Interactions with the product, isopanose The crystal structure of IPU in complex with isopanose, the product of pullulan, has been determined at 1.7-Å resolution. After the final refinement, an omit map shows that one isopanose molecule binds to each copy of the IPU molecules (Fig. 3a). Although noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not applied throughout the refinement, isopanose was found to form the same contacts with IPU. To facilitate the description of the complex, the three glucose residues are labeled as Glc + 1 to Glc + 3, and the corresponding substrate-binding sites are designated subsites + 1 to + 3 (numbers are based on the nomenclature of Davies et al.27). The overall conformation of IPU in complex with isopanose was essentially identical with that of unliganded IPU, with an r.m.s.d. of 0.51 Å. The isopanose-binding cleft, namely, aglycon-binding subsites, is located at the center of domain C around coils 4, 5 and 6, and forms a narrow groove. In addition to domain C, the extended loop NA of domain N is engaged in forming the cleft of aglyconbinding subsites. A schematic representation of the hydrogen-bonding interaction between IPU and isopanose is presented in Fig. 3b. Glc + 1 is located at the narrowest part of the groove. This glucose residue not only forms multiple hydrogen bonds with Asp353, Glu399 and Asn428 but also makes a hydrophobic contact with Trp402, thus appearing to bind tightly to IPU. Glc + 2 and Glc + 3 interact with both domain C and domain N. Gly350, Gln351, Asn424 and Asn427 from domain C make hydrogen bonds with Glc + 2 and Glc + 3. In addition, the extended loop NA, located at domain N, contributes to the binding of Glc + 2 and Glc + 3. The O2 hydroxyl group of Glc + 2 forms a hydrogen bond with the O1 atom of Gln91, and the O3 hydroxyl group of Glc + 3 makes hydrogen bonds with the main-chain O atom of Gln88. N-Glycosylation sites The primary structure of IPU contains 15 potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs.28 The IPU enzyme produced from the original strain, A. niger ATCC9642, and the heterologously expressed IPU produced by A. oryzae are highly N-glycosylated, and enzymatic deglycosylation resulted in a decrease in the activity and stability of IPU.21 To crystallize IPU, the enzyme was treated with Endo Hf in this study. Endo Hf cleaves the glycosidic bond of the two internal GlcNAc residues

Domain C is folded into a large right-handed cylinder, termed parallel -helix (Fig. 2b). The -helix structure is composed of 10 complete coils, which contain three twisted parallel -sheets (PB1, PB2 and PB3; names are as adopted for the pectate lyase C15) (Fig. 1c). The distances of the backbones of each coil are approximately 4.5­5.0 Å. Three incomplete coils are also found around the N- and C-terminal sides of domain C (denoted a­c in Fig. 2b). The PBs are connected by three turns: T1 (between PB1 and PB2), T2 (between PB2 and PB3) and T3 (between PB3 and PB1). All T2 turns are short, whereas the lengths of T1 and T3 turns vary. Three turns, T3 of coil 2, T1 of coil 8 and T1 of coil 10, of IPU are especially extended, and the sequence similarity with the corresponding regions of Dex49A is low (Fig. 2c). From the alignment shown in Fig. 2c, Asp353, Asp372 and Asp373 are identified as the catalytic residues of IPU. The three catalytic residues are located on T3 of coil 4 and on T3 of coil 5. In addition, T3 of coil 2, T1 and T3 of coil 7, and T3 of coil 8 are involved in the formation of the U-shaped active cleft of IPU. Based on homology with GH49 and GH28 enzymes, Asp372 would act as a proton donor, while either Asp353 or Asp373 is expected to act as a base.13,26 The distance between the O4 atom of Glc + 1 and the O2 atom of Asp372 is 2.7 Å, which appears to be ideal for the nucleophile to attack the -1,4-glucosidic linkage. The O2 atom of Asp353 forms a hydrogen bond with the O4 atom of Glc + 1 via a water molecule; thus, Asp353 may be suitable for incorporating the water molecule into the active site during hydrolysis.

216 of N-linked oligosaccharides, and one GlcNAc residue remains attached to the polypeptide chain.29 After placement and refinement of the polypeptide chain of IPU, the electron densities corresponding to the GlcNAc residues were seen in the omit maps of each molecule (Table 1). In the unliganded IPU, 11 (Mol-1) and 12 (Mol-2) GlcNAc residues were found; in the isopanose complex form, 12 (Mol-1) and 11 (Mol-2) residues were found. In Mol-1, complete maps for all the GlcNAc residues were observed in both unliganded and isopanose complex forms. In Mol-2, most of the maps for the GlcNAc residues were clear, but part of the density for the residues linked to Asn210, Asn381 and Asn455 of the unliganded form, and to Asn115, Asn138 and Asn305 of the isopanose complex form, was not visible (data not shown). The glycosylation sites are uniformly distributed on the molecular surface of IPU, which seems to act like wrapping paper for the enzyme, and the GlcNAc residues are not found in the vicinity of the catalytic cleft (Fig. 4). It is likely that the sugar chains prevent the molecular surface from being exposed to the solvent, thus contributing to enzyme stability. While the glycosylation of most potential Nglycosylation sites was seen, electron density maps corresponding to the GlcNAc around the two residues, Asn186 and Asn486, were never observed (Table 2). Asn186 is located at the linker connecting domains N and C (Fig. 4); Pro193-Pro196, the region near Asn186, is observed to have the highest B-factor in the whole protein structure, as described above. In fact, the average B-factor of the linker region (residues 183­196) of Mol-1 (20.9 Å2) is higher than that of the whole of the Mol-1 protein (14.9 Å2); because of flexibility, it is unclear whether the N-

Crystal Structure of Isopullulanase

linked oligosaccharide is not visible or the site is not glycosylated. Asn486 is located at PB2 of coil 9 of domain C. Asn460, which is glycosylated in all molecules, is located at PB2 of coil 8. These two asparagine residues are positioned adjacent to each other at a distance of 4.8 Å, and Asn486 could not be glycosylated due to steric hindrance. Comparison of active-site structure between IPU and Dex49A The active sites of IPU and Dex49A were compared to address the structural features of IPU. The residues in the catalytic cleft of IPU in complex with isopanose, and of Dex49A in complex with isomaltose, are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The amino acid residues illustrated in Fig. 5 were chosen based on an analysis with the program LIGPLOT; 30 several conserved residues among GH49, which were found to be critical for hydrolysis in our site-directed mutagenesis studies,9 are also indicated. These amino acid residues are categorized into two groups: residues conserved between IPU and Dex49A (green in Fig. 5) and those uniquely found in either of the enzymes (orange in Fig. 5). The residues conserved between IPU and Dex49A appear to be at the potential subsites - 2 and -1, and also at positions that can interact with the O4 and O6 hydroxyl groups of Glc + 1. In contrast, residues interacting with the O2 and O3 hydroxyl groups of Glc + 1 and also residues interacting with Glc + 2 and Glc + 3 are not conserved between IPU and Dex49A. We have reported that the specificity of the glycon-binding subsites of IPU is similar to that of dextranases in spite of the difference in substrate specificity,9 and

The GlcNAc residues linked to Asn24, Asn94, Asn115, Asn210, Asn305, Asn381, Asn448, Asn455, Asn460, Asn491, Asn503 and Asn535 are illustrated based on Mol-1 of the IPU­isopanose complex, and an additional GlcNAc residue linked to Asn138 of Mol-2 is also included in the illustration. Domain N (pink) and domain C (cyan) are presented as a surface model, and the linker connecting the domains is illustrated in the tube-based representation (green). The positions of Asn186 and Asn486 are shown in purple. Isopanose is shown in red. The orientation of the right panel is rotated through 180° from that of the left panel. This figure, along with Figs. 5 and 6, was generated using PyMol.

Fig. 5. Stereo view of the active sites of the IPU­isopanose (a) and Dex49A­isomaltose (b) complex forms. Isopanose and isomaltose are shown in red and blue, respectively. Residues conserved between IPU and Dex49A are shown in green, and residues that are unique to IPU or Dex49A are shown in orange. Two C backbones, loop NA and turn T3 of coil 7, are shown in pink and yellow, respectively.

many of the conserved residues are found in the glycon-binding subsites of IPU. Superpositioning of the whole structures of IPU and Dex49A shows that Glc + 1 and Glc + 2 of isopanose bound to IPU differ in orientation from the corresponding glucose residues of isomaltose bound to Dex49A (Fig. 2a). Compared with their backbone structures, two regions, turn T3 of coil 7 of the -helix structure (yellow in Fig. 5) and loop NA of domain N (pink in Fig. 5), adopt markedly different conformations. From Asn427 to Asn428, T3 of coil 7 forms a bulge and is mainly in contact with Glc + 2. This bulge seems to fix the orientation of the O1 atom of Glc + 2 toward domain N, which enables Glc + 3 to interact with loop NA. Although a similar bulge is seen in T3 of coil 7 of Dex49A, it protrudes into Glc + 1 of isomaltose. Therefore, atom O1 of the Glc + 2 of isomaltose orients toward the opposite side from domain N, implying that the Glc + 3 of Dex49A is located in a completely different position from that of IPU. Loop NA also composes a major part of the catalytic cleft of IPU, and Gln88 makes a hydrogen bond with Glc + 3 (Figs. 3b and 5a). In the vicinity of the O1 and O2 atoms of Glc + 3, there is a glycine

residue, Gly350, located at T3 of coil 4, which provides an open space large enough to accommodate a glucose residue. It is likely that Glc + 4 is placed in this position, and Trp277, located at T3 of coil 2, plays a key role for holding Glc + 4. T3 of coil 2 is also expected to have many contacts with Glc + 4. In Dex49A, only limited interactions are observed between T3 of coil 2 and the product, isomaltose, since Phe373, the position equivalent to Gly350 of IPU, makes a steric barrier due to its bulky side chain. Although Tyr303 of Dex49A (the position equivalent to Trp277 of IPU) can interact with the product, this residue reportedly forms a hydrogen bond with a different glucose residue, Glc + 1.13 Likewise, the interaction between loop NA of Dex49A and the product is much less extensive than that of IPU, and Asp86, the residue corresponding to Gln88 of IPU, makes hydrogen bonds with Glc + 1 and Glc + 2, which are glucose residues different from those in the case of IPU. There is no space for accommodating an additional glucose residue around Phe373. Together with the observations described above, the unique shape of the catalytic cleft, characterized by T3 of coil 7, loop NA and Gly350, is critical in determining the specificity of IPU for pullulan.

218 Comparison to GH28 enzymes The similarity of the -helix fold between the Dex49A and GH28 enzymes has been described.13 We searched for the structural homology of domain C of IPU using the DALI server.31 Apart from the homology to Dex49A, the result shows that domain C of IPU resembled polygalacturonase from Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (PDB ID 1BHE; Z score = 26.5)32 and polygalacturonase II (endoPG II) from A. niger (PDB ID 1CZF; Z score = 24.1),33 both of which belong to GH28. The backbones of the domain C of IPU and the whole of endoPG II were superposed (Fig. 6). The lengths of the pitches of each coil of -helix are essentially identical, but the backbones of extended loops, coils 2­4 of T3 and coils 7­10 of T1, adopt different structures. Although almost none of the amino acid residues was conserved between the two enzymes (data not shown), the positions of the three catalytic aspartyl residues, Asp353(IPU)­Asp180(endoPG II), Asp372­201 and Asp373­202, are shared. T1 turns of coils 2 and 3 of endoPG II are short, whereas the corresponding turns of IPU are relatively long, providing a narrow cleft produced by T1 and T3 of coils 2 and 3 for IPU (Fig. 6). It has been shown that polygalacturonases with various types of processivity for substrates are secreted by A. niger, and Pagès et al. reported that the processive behavior of endoPG II was altered by mutating Ser91, located in the vicinity of T1 turns of coils 2 and 3.34,35 Cho et al. reported a modeled structure of the polygalacturonase­octagalacturonate complex and proposed that the corresponding position located at coil 3 of Aspergillus aculeatus polygalacturonases is subsite - 5.36 It is likely that the architecture of the narrow cleft produced by coils 2

and 3 may reflect the substrate preference of GH49 enzymes.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of IPU and isopanose Recombinant IPU produced by Pi. pastoris was purified as described previously.20 For crystallization, the purified enzyme was mixed with 250 U of Endo Hf (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) per milligram of IPU and incubated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for 24 h at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was applied to a HiLoad Q-Sepharose 16/10 HP column (1.60 cm × 10 cm; GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and eluted with a linear gradient of 60­120 mM sodium chloride in the same buffer at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Two peaks for IPU (61 kDa and 65 kDa in SDS-PAGE) were obtained due to the difference in sugar content, and the 61-kDa protein was used for crystallization. Protein concentrations were determined by the measurement of absorbance at 280 nm using the formula of Gill and von Hippel. 37 Isopanose [Glc--(1  4)-Glc--(1  6)-Glc] was prepared as described.38 Crystallization and data collection The crystals were grown at 20 °C using the hangingdrop vapor-diffusion method, where 1 l of a 15-mg/ml IPU solution in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.5) was mixed with an equal volume of a crystallization reservoir solution containing 8.75% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 8000 in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6). For data collection at cryogenic temperatures, the crystals were transferred to a solution consisting of the well solution

The crystal of the complex of IPU with isopanose was obtained by soaking in the same cryoprotectant solution containing 50 mM isopanose. The diffraction data of IPU were collected at the PF-BL18B (unliganded form at 2.4-Å resolution; data not shown) and PF-BL5A (unliganded form at 1.7-Å resolution and isopanose complex) beamlines (Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan). All data were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000.39 Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Phasing and refinement The structure of the unliganded IPU at 2.4-Å resolution was initially solved by molecular replacement with the program Molrep in the CCP4 suite,24 and a model predicted using the SWISS-MODEL server9 was employed as a probe model. All refinement cycles were carried out using the program CNS.40 Manual adjustment and rebuilding of the model were carried out with the program Xfit in the XtalView system.41 After the 2.4-Å resolution data set had been refined and the model of IPU had been built (PDB ID 1WMR), a higher-resolution data set (1.7-Å resolution) was collected and used for further refinement. To avoid overfitting of the diffraction data, a free R-factor, with 10% of the test set excluded from refinement, was monitored. Refinements of the final structure were converged at Rwork = 0.195 and Rfree = 0.229. The r.m.s.d. between Mol-1 and Mol-2 was calculated with the program CNS. The structure of the IPU­isopanose complex was solved by molecular replacement, using the unliganded IPU as the starting model. After simulated annealing refinement using CNS, difference Fourier maps clearly revealed a density corresponding to isopanose molecules. The structure of the IPU­isopanose complex was finally refined with CNS (Rwork = 0.187 and Rfree = 0.211). Superpositioning of IPU and other protein structures and calculation of the r.m.s.d. values were carried out with the program Swiss-PdbViewer.42 Figures were prepared using XtalView, MOLSCRIPT,22 Raster3D23 and PyMol. PDB accession number The atomic coordinates and structural factors of the unliganded IPU (PDB ID 1X0C) and isopanose complex (PDB ID 2Z8G) have been deposited in the PDB.
