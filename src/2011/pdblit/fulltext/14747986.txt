ABSTRACT The solution structure of the acidic protein HI1450 from Haemophilus influenzae has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. HI1450 has homologues in ten other bacterial species including Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia pestis but there are no functional assignments for any members of the family. Thirty-one of the amino acids in this 107-residue protein are aspartates or glutamates, contributing to an unusually low pI of 3.72. The secondary structure elements are arranged in an - - - - - order with the two alpha helices packed against the same side of an antiparallel four-stranded beta meander. Two large loops, one between 1 and 2 and the other between 2 and 3 bend almost perpendicularly across the -strands in opposite directions on the non-helical side of the -sheet to form a conserved hydrophobic cavity. The HI1450 structure has some similarities to the structure of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) mimic uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) including the distribution of surface charges and the position of the hydrophobic cavity. Based on these similarities, as well as having a comparable molecular surface to dsDNA, we propose that HI1450 may function as a dsDNA mimic in order to inhibit or regulate an as yet unidentified dsDNA binding protein.

Key words: structural genomics; dsDNA mimic; Ugi; NMR INTRODUCTION In the past few years a massive amount of genetic information pertaining to all walks of life has been generated from genomic sequencing efforts. Dispersed among the genes for known proteins encoded by these genomes are genes that have never been studied but hypothetically code for a protein. Often, these hypothetical proteins are conserved in several different species, suggesting that they are in fact real proteins, but the functions are unknown and cannot be deduced from the protein sequence due to a lack of homology with any proteins of known function. One suggested method to annotate the function of the hypothetical protein is to determine its high-resolution structure first and compare it to all known structures. Optimally, the hypothetical protein will have a known protein fold that is associated with a known function. In other cases there may be clues from the

structure such as bound ligands or potential active sites. One of the targets in our current structural genomics project (http://s2f.carb.nist.gov) on hypothetical proteins from Haemophilus influenzae is HI1450. This is a small protein of 107 amino acids with known sequence homologues in Pasturella multocida, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Yersinia pestis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus somnus, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi, and Shigella flexneri, all of which have greater than 48 percent identity and greater than 75 percent similarity to HI1450. HI1450 has thirteen aspartates and eighteen glutamates resulting in a calculated pI of 3.72, the third lowest pI among H. influenzae proteins.1 Here, we describe the solution structure of this highly acidic protein and discuss the possible functional implications of the structure. We show that these negatively charged residues are arranged in winding patterns on the surface similar to the charge distribution seen in dsDNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation HI1450 was amplified from Haemophilus influenzae genomic DNA and inserted into the pET-15b vector (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. E.coli BL21(DE3) cells induced with the constructed plasmid were grown in minimal media containing either 15N-ammonium chloride;

N-ammonium chloride and 13C-glucose; or 13C-glucose, N-ammonium chloride and 60% D2O. As the plasmid was unstable when the E.coli was grown in minimal media, 100 mg/L carbenicillin was used rather than ampicillin and growths in liquid media were conducted within one day. The protein was purified and the (His)6 tag removed using methods previously described.2 The final buffer conditions for all samples were 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA, at pH 6.75. The samples used for the 2D NOESY and 2D TOCSY were lyophilized and dissolved into 99.9% D2O. All other samples were in 10% D2O and 90% H2O. The oligomeric state of the protein was determined by light scattering methods described earlier.3 NMR Spectroscopy Spectra were collected at 300 K on a Bruker DRX-500 or DRX-600 equipped with 3-axis gradient probes and recorded in States-TPPI mode. Pulsed-field gradients were used for coherence selection and solvent suppression. Data were processed on a Linux workstation using nmrPipe/ nmrDraw4 and analyzed using Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, UCSF). Backbone atom assignments were made from the HNCACB,5 HNCO,6 and CBCACONH7 experiments. Side chains for most atoms were assigned from the HBHA(CBCACO)NH,7 (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY,8,9 H(CCO)NH-TOCSY,8,9 and 2D-TOCSY.10 The aromatic side-chain atoms were identified from 2D-CBHD,11 2DCBHE,11 and 2D-TOCSY spectra. Backbone dihedral angle restraints ( ) were identified initially using Talos12 and secondary 1H and 13C chemical shifts. These were confirmed later with 3JHNH coupling constants from a 3D HNHA13 experiment and characteristic NOE restraints. Hydrogen bonds were assigned if the amide protons signals were present in a 15N-HSQC spectrum forty minutes after the lyophilized protein (originally in water) was dissolved in 99.9% D2O and if acceptor/donor heavy atoms were consistently within 3.2 Å and had favorable geometries (HN O angle 120°). Inter-proton distance restraints were obtained from 3D 15N-NOESY14 ( m 120 ms) and 3D 13C-NOESY15 ( m 100 ms) spectra run on a sample in water, and a 2D NOESY16 ( m 150 ms) spectrum collected on a sample in D2O. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were collected for N-HN, C -C , C -HN, N-C , H -C , and C -NH using the IPAP ­ HSQC,17 HNCA,18 and IPAP-HNCO19 experiments. Steady-state {1H}-15N NOEs were measured using a relaxation delay of two seconds with three seconds of saturation for the NOE experiment. The reference spectrum was acquired with a five second relaxation delay.20 Structure Calculations Structures were calculated initially from an extended polypeptide chain using CNS 1.121 and standard simulated annealing and torsion angle dynamics protocols. All prochiral groups were given floating stereospecific assignments until they could be unambiguously assigned from the structure. An initial set of NOE restraints was generated automatically using NOEID, an in-house NOE assign-

ment program. NOEID uses the NOESY peak list and through-bond chemical shift assignments to determine a set of NOE assignments and allows multiple assignments for a given peak. The resulting NOE assignments are automatically converted into restraint file format (either CNS or ARIA) and can also be displayed back onto spectra in SPARKY format. After the initial assignment using NOEID, further assignments were done manually in a semi-automated fashion using NOEID and intermediate structures to iteratively narrow down multiple assignments. Further details regarding NOEID can be found at http://orban.umbi.umd.edu/NOEID. Distance restraints based on peak intensities were categorized as strong (1.8 to 3.0 Å), medium (1.8 to 4.0 Å), weak (1.8 to 5.5 Å) and very weak (2.8 to 6.0 Å). Backbone (phi) dihedral restraints were 60 20° for -helix residues and 120 30° for -strand residues. Hydrogen bond restraints were 1.5 to 2.5 Å for rHN-O and 2.3 to 3.2 Å for rN-O. Hydrogen bonds were used only in the final stages of structure calculation. Resolved RDCs for all of the bond vectors except H -C in the well defined areas of secondary structure were used in combination with a high resolution NOE-derived structure to calculate the axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor using MODULE.22 Inclusion of the H -C restraints resulted in obvious errors in alignment tensor values. In addition, while most RDCs involving carbon couplings gave reasonable correlations between experimental and calculated values after initial refinement, the H -C couplings did not. In contrast, the 1 DNH couplings gave excellent correlations between experimental and calculated values after structure refinement and only these RDC restraints were used in the final structure with an error range of 1.0 Hz. Final force constants were 1,000 kcal mol 1 Å 2 for bond lengths, 500 kcal mol 1 rad 2 for angles and improper torsions, 40 kcal mol 1 Å 2 for experimental distance restraints, 200 kcal mol 1 rad 2 for dihedral angle restraints, 4.0 kcal mol 1 Å 4 for the van der Waals repulsion term, and 1.1 kcal mol 1 Hz 1 for the RDC force constant. The twenty best structures were chosen based on a low total energy, no NOE distance violations greater than 0.35 Å, no dihedral restraint violations greater than 5°, fewer than 10 bad contacts per 100 residues (as calculated by PROCHECK23), and a dihedral G factor greater than 0.5 (calculated by PROCHECK). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Chemical Shift and NOE Assignments A total of 482 out of the 489 expected backbone and side-chain proton assignments were made using standard triple resonance experiments. Thirty-seven out of a total of 160 proton or methyl pairs were stereospecifically assigned. Figure 1 is a labeled 15N-HSQC of HI1450. Unassigned protons included the second H methyl groups of Leu29, Leu35, and Leu63, the second H methyl group of Val47, the H protons of Lys106, the H protons of Asn28, and the H protons of Leu63. In addition to the expected assignments, the guanidino proton resonances of the three

nature of the initial NOESY assignments using NOEID. On average, approximately 15 inter-residue NOE restraints were obtained for each amino acid in the polypeptide chain with loop residues generally having the fewest number of inter-residue restraints [Fig. 2(b)]. Structure Description HI1450 is a monomer in solution as determined by a combination of size exclusion chromatography and in-line laser light scattering24. The solution structure of HI1450 consists of an - - - - - order for the secondary structure elements with the two alpha helices packed against the same side of an anti-parallel four-stranded beta sheet [Figs. 2(a) and 4(b)]. The first four residues of the Nterminus are not highly structured as evidenced by a lack of NOE restraints. Assignments for the Gly-Ser-His tail remaining on the N-terminus of the protein after thrombin cleavage could not be made and were not included in structure calculations. The 1 and 2 helices are at an angle of about thirty degrees to one another and are connected by a six-residue loop. The four -strands are arranged in the sheet in a -meander motif. Two large loops, one between 1 and 2 and the other between 2 and 3 bend almost perpendicularly across the -strands in opposite directions on the non-helical side of the -sheet. The -sheet has an obvious twist due in part to the 1- 2 loop. Figure 2(a) is an overlay of the twenty best structures and Figure 2(d) shows the RMSD per residue illustrating the level of precision obtained. The overall backbone and all heavy atom RMSDs are summarized in Table I. Figure 2(c) shows the steady-state {1H}-15N NOEs for all residues except Gln40, Arg44, and Glu68, which had significant overlap. The loop regions are more disordered than other parts of the structure and have backbone RMSDs greater than 1.0 Å, the second loop between 2 and 3 having the highest backbone RMSD (1.8 Å) of the three. This is due both to the flexibility of the loops [Fig. 2(c)] and a lack of NOE restraint assignments in those regions [Fig. 2(b)]. In contrast, the -strands and the C-terminus of the 1-helix are the most ordered and have backbone RMSDs less than 0.5 Å on average whereas the 2-helix has a slightly higher RMSD of about 0.8 Å. The relatively small RMSD difference between the 1- and 2- helices does not appear to be due to dynamics but rather the smaller number of longrange restraints obtained for the 2-helix [Figs. 2(b) and (c)]. Charge Distribution and Conservation The many negatively charged residues found in HI1450 are distributed mainly along the 1-helix and in the 1- 2, 2- 3, and 3- 4 loops. Figure 3 is a sequence alignment of HI1450 and its homologues in other organisms. Because the protein sequences are very similar, residues were only considered conserved if they were 100% identical (dark boxes-invariant) or 100% equivalent (light boxes-conserved). Most of the invariant residues are found in regions of defined secondary structure. The largest series of identical residues shared by all the homologues is found

arginines were clearly detected and assigned from a 3D 15 N-edited NOESY spectrum. Using NOEID, initial NOE assignments were made for all intra-residue and sequential connectivities, and approximately ten percent of the medium and long range contacts. A total of 3,833 NOESY assignments were made from a list of 4,137 NOESY picked peaks. Of these NOE assignments, 3,542 were used as restraints to calculate the structure (Table I). Restraints that were not used were from overlapped peaks with resolved reciprocal peaks, very weak peaks without reciprocal assignments, and intraresidue restraints from the 2D NOESY. The NOE-type distribution of the restraints that were used in the structure calculation can be seen in Table I. Almost half of the assigned NOEs are intraresidue due to the automated

in the 1-helix and consists of residues 17 through 23. Two of these invariant residues, Asp19 and Glu23, combine with invariant Asp11 and conserved Asp15 to form a line of negatively charged residues exposed on the surface of the 1-helix [Fig. 4(b)], suggesting that they may be important for function. Residues 27 through 45 are all conserved; Leu29, Pro32, Asp34, Leu37, Phe38, Gln41, Phe42, Gly45 are invariant. This region contains most of the 1- 2 loop, the hydrophobic 2-helix and the 2- 1 loop. Residues in the 1- 2, 2- 3, and 3- 4 loops are noticeably less conserved although the 1- 2 loop does contain two invariant residues, Asp55 and Trp56. Trp56 seems to be important structurally as it helps anchor the 1- 2 loop by hydrophobic interactions with residues Glu71, Leu91, Lys89, and Ile104 in the -sheet. By comparison, Asp55 is very solvent accessible and may possibly play a functional role. The final seven-residue loop between strands 3 and 4 is composed almost completely of charged residues in HI1450. Glu97 and Arg99 are conserved and there is always a negatively charged residue at either position 95 or 96 in the homologues of HI1450. Overall, 21 of the 31 negatively charged residues in HI1450 are conserved and all of the homologues in other organisms have 27 or more negatively charged residues (Fig. 3). Structural Homologues of HI1450 A CE25 search retrieved five protein folds all with Z-scores below 4.0 and C RMSDs to the HI1450 structure above 3.7 Å. Figure 4(a) shows a sequence alignment of these folds based on the structure. Residues 185­281 of copper amine oxidase (PDB code 1DYU)26 fold into a structure most resembling HI1450. The oxidase domain contains the same number of secondary structure elements as HI1450, as well as the two large loops that fold over the -sheet; however, there are no similarities in the charge distribution between the two proteins. Two proteins, uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) and chorismate lyase (PDB codes 1UD127 and 1G8128 respectively), have a large 1- 2 loop with a charge distribution similar to the 1- 2 loop in HI1450. Upon further inspection, Ugi is the only protein that shares some of the charge distribution seen elsewhere in HI1450. In addition, Ugi has a low pI of 4.2 similar to that of HI1450. Figures 4b and c show HI1450 and Ugi side-by-side. Ugi has a -sheet consisting of five anti-parallel -strands and two short -helices, one on each side of the -sheet. The first helix of Ugi aligns with the C-terminal half of the first helix of HI1450. Ugi lacks the 2-helix of HI1450 and transitions into the 1-strand via a loop. As in HI1450, the 1-strand is followed by a large loop but in Ugi this loop is interrupted by the small 2-helix. No such helix is observed in HI1450. Strands 2 through 4 in HI1450 align reasonably well with those in Ugi although Ugi lacks the large loop between 2 and 3. HI1450 lacks the fifth strand seen in Ugi. The similarities in charge distribution are clearly seen in Figures 4 and 5. The 2- 3 loop in HI1450 and the 2- 3 and 4- 5 loops in Ugi all contain multiple negatively charged residues. The first helix of Ugi and the loop between strands 3 and 4 also contain nega-

tively charged residues that are topologically similar to those in HI1450. The Function of HI1450 The similarities in structure and surface electrostatic potential between HI1450 and Ugi provide insights into the potential function of HI1450. Ugi inhibits uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) by mimicking the natural DNA substrate of UDG. This restrains the uracil-mediated baseexcision repair pathway of the host bacterium and allows stable incorporation of uracil residues into the unique uracil utilizing dsDNA genome of PBS1.29 There are two regions of Ugi that interact with UDG. The 1-strand of Ugi mimics the phosphate backbone of dsDNA both in its shape and in its distribution of charges while the hydrophobic cavity formed between the 2-helix and the -sheet sequesters the conserved leucine residue of UDG that is normally inserted into dsDNA as part of the mechanism to remove uracil. Both of these structural features are also present in HI1450. Figure 4(d) is an overlay of the 1strands of Ugi, HI1450, and the dsDNA that Ugi mimics (PDB code 1SSP30). Along the 1-strand of Ugi, Glu20 and Glu28 align with the P0 and P 2 phosphate groups of the phosphodiester backbone. Glu48 and Glu51 of HI1450

align with the same phosphate groups. In addition, HI1450 Asp54 aligns with the P 3 phosphate group of the dsDNA. All three of these residues are conserved in the HI1450 family of sequences. In HI1450, the -sheet and two large loops on the non-helical side of the sheet form a hydrophobic cavity that aligns with the cavity formed by the -sheet and second helix in Ugi [see Fig. 5(a, b)]. This hydrophobic cavity consists of the surface residues Val86, Met83, Val50, Trp73, Lys89, and Glu71 in HI1450 and Met24, Val29, Val32, Ile33, Val43, Met56, Leu58, and Val71 in Ugi. All of the residues in the HI1450 cavity are conserved except Trp73 and only Glu71 is invariant. The cavities have a slightly different shape due to the presence of a larger 2- 3 loop in HI1450, but the main difference is the unconserved Trp73 in the center of the HI1450 cavity. If HI1450 is aligned with the crystal structure of Ugi in complex with UDG (PDB code 1UDI), Trp73 occupies the same space as the UDG active site leucine and a nearby proline. The above similarities with Ugi suggest that HI1450 may also function as a dsDNA mimic. This idea is further strengthened when the molecular surface of HI1450 [Fig. 5(d)] is compared with that of a B-DNA dodecamer [Fig.

Oxygen atoms are colored red, nitrogen atoms are blue, and all other atoms are white. Hydrogen atoms are not present in the structures. (a) and (b) are oriented such that the loop sides of the -sheets in HI1450 and Ugi are facing the reader. The 1 strand is at the top of the proteins. In (d) and (e) the proteins have been rotated 180° from (a) and (b) along their horizontal axis so that the 1 strands are now at the bottom of the figures and the first helices of both proteins are facing out (Figures 4(b) and (c) are oriented in the same fashion). Residues discussed in the text are labeled. The distances shown in (c) and (d) were measured from the centers of carboxylate or phosphate groups.

5(c)]. All residues used in the following measurements are conserved. The nearest neighbor distance between the carboxylate groups of Asp11, Asp15, Asp19, and Glu23 in the 1-helix of HI1450 is 7.2 Å on average, the same distance found between neighboring phosphodiester groups of dsDNA suggesting that the 1-helix may mimic a phosphate backbone. To the left of the first helix [Fig. 5(d)] where the minor groove of the dsDNA would be, there is a lack of prominent residues until Glu42. Glu42 is positioned on average 15.5 Å away from Asp15, one of the charged residues in the first helix. The comparable distance in dsDNA is 15.9 Å. The oxygen atoms seen above Glu42 in the proximity of the hydrophobic 2-helix belong to the backbone and side chain carbonyl groups of Asn38.

To the right of the 1-helix where the major groove of the dsDNA would be there is another space lacking prominent residues until Glu96. The distance between the 1-helix and Glu96 is on average 19.3 Å whereas the corresponding distance in dsDNA is about 18.6 Å. It should be noted here that Glu96 is not conserved based on the definition used; however, where a homologue to HI1450 lacks a negative residue at position 96, there is always one in position 95 (see Fig. 3). Overall, the above distances between negatively charged groups appear to be more consistent with dsDNA than dsRNA.31 Proteins that mimic nucleic acids structurally are not common and only three other examples of dsDNA mimics have been reported in the literature to date. Ocr protein

from the T7 bacteriophage is a helical protein that dimerizes to mimic 20 bases of a bent dsDNA.32 Interestingly, present on two of the ocr helices are lines of negatively charged residues spaced in a fashion similar to the residues in the 1-helix of HI1450. TAFII230 from Drosophila melanogaster mimics an unwound TATA box in order to inhibit the TATA box binding protein (TBP).33 The shape and charge of the TAFII230 protein is visually very similar to the DNA that it mimics. Finally, while the structure of the first domain of the 70 subunit in prokaryotes is unknown, it has been proposed to act as a dsDNA mimic in order to serve as a placeholder for dsDNA in the holoen70 34 zyme (RNA polymerase ) and to inhibit dsDNA 70 24 binding in free . All three of these proteins have low pIs [3.9, 3.84, and 3.66 (the first domain only), respectively] similar to that of HI1450. CONCLUSION The structure of HI1450 provides some important clues that point to a likely function. The low pI and the distribution of charges around the protein indicate that it probably interacts with another protein or a smaller, positively charged molecule. The pattern and spacing of negatively charged residues on the protein surface suggest that HI1450 may function as a dsDNA mimic in a similar way to the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage protein Ugi. The structural similarity with Ugi, although weak, is relevant due to the conservation of the 1-strand, the following 1- 2 loop and the hydrophobic cavity. Overall, the charge distribution is similar although there is an obvious visual difference at the helical face of HI1450, which more closely resembles dsDNA than does Ugi [compare Figure 5(c), (d), and (e)]. HI1450 has a longer 1-helix and 2- 3 loop than Ugi, which would appear to make binding to UDG in the same manner sterically more difficult. Experiments to test this directly are in progress. Alternatively, HI1450 may mimic dsDNA in order to regulate or inhibit some other nucleic acid binding protein. As HI1450 has homologues in a relatively small number of organisms, perhaps it interacts with another protein specific to those same organisms. There are 35 proteins conserved in the same organisms as HI1450 that are not found elsewhere and twenty-eight of these are identified as putative or hypothetical. Further experiments are underway to identify the target molecule of HI1450.
