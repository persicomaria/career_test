Abstract The legume lectins are a large family of homologous carbohydrate binding proteins that are found mainly in the seeds of most legume plants. Despite their strong similarity on the level of their amino acid sequences and tertiary structures, their carbohydrate specificities and quaternary structures vary widely. In this review we will focus on the structural features of legume lectins and their complexes with carbohydrates. These will be discussed in the light of recent mutagenesis results when appropriate. Monosaccharide specificity seems to be achieved by the use of a conserved core of residues that hydrogen bond to the sugar, and a variable loop that determines the exact shape of the monosaccharide binding site. The higher affinity for particular oligosaccharides and monosaccharides containing a hydrophobic aglycon results mainly from a few distinct subsites next to the monosaccharide binding site. These subsites consist of a small number of variable residues and are found in both the mannose and galactose specificity groups. The quaternary structures of these proteins form the basis of a higher level of specificity, where the spacing between individual epitopes of multivalent carbohydrates becomes important. This results in homogeneous cross-linked lattices even in mixed precipitation systems, and is of relevance for their effects on the biological activities of cells such as mitogenic responses. Quaternary structure is also thought to play an important role in the high affinity interaction between some legume lectins and adenine and a series of adenine-derived plant hormones. The molecular basis of the variation in quaternary structure in this group of proteins is poorly understood. q 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Recognition between proteins and carbohydrates is of prime importance in many biological processes, such as viral, bacterial, mycoplasmal and parasitic infections, targeting of cells and soluble components, fertilisation, cancer metastasis and growth and differentiation. Legume lectins are the model system of choice to study the molecular basis of these recognition events because they are not only easy to purify in large quantities, but also exhibit a wide variety of carbohydrate specificities despite strong sequence conservation w1x. Legume lectins have, for decades, been a paradigm in the area of protein≠carbohydrate recognition. Lectin activity in plant seeds has been demonstrated as early as 1888 w2x. Despite the lack of knowledge on their in vivo activity, they have proven to be useful tools in immunology and glycobiology because of their wide range of specificities for complex carbohydrates. Their carbohydrate specificity has also allowed them to be used in such applications as purification and characterisation of complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates and bone marrow transplantation. Thus, the in vitro function of these proteins Zcarbohydrate recognition. is well documented and the molecular basis of this interaction has been studied with a variety of biophysical techniques, including X-ray crystallography, NMR and microcalorimetry.

Legume lectins are not only of interest because of their carbohydrate binding properties. Related to their potential to agglutinate cells and to precipitate multivalent carbohydrates is the fact that these proteins are oligomeric, forming either dimers or tetramers. Recent structural data have demonstrated that an essentially strongly conserved monomeric unit can oligomerise in a variety of ways, making these proteins also of interest to analyse the details of protein≠protein interaction. Furthermore, quaternary structure relates to activity, as has been shown in recent years for a variety of lectins: highly ordered homogeneous cross-linked lattices are formed when lectins are mixed with multivalent carbohydrates, resulting in a higher form of specificity than can be achieved on the level of the monomer. In this review, we will focus on the structure of legume lectins and analyse the structural basis of their carbohydrate specificity. 2. The legume lectin monomer The legume lectins form a large family of homologous proteins. Of about 50 legume lectin sequences that have been determined all show pairwise sequence identities not lower than 35%. Recently, it has been suggested that also in the animal kingdom legume lectin homologues may be present w3≠5x. For 11 members of the legume lectin family, crystallo-

graphic co-ordinates have been deposited at the protein data bank Zsee also Tables 1 and 2. . These include concanavalin A w6,7x, PHA-L w8x, the lectins from pea w9x, lentil w10,11x, Lathyrus ochrus w12x, peanut w13,14x, soybean w15x, coral tree w16x, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin IV w17x. The structures of the lectin-related a-amylase inhibitor from Phaseolus ’ulgaris w18x and arcelin w19x, which have no known carbohydrate binding activity, are also known. The best refined structure to date is that of concanavalin ∞ A, which has been refined at 1.2 A w20x and presently ∞ being further refined against 0.94 A data w21x. Not surprisingly, the legume lectin monomer is structurally well conserved. It consists of two large bpleated sheets that form a scaffold on which the carbohydrate binding region is grafted ZFig. 1Z a... The same architecture and topology is found in a wide variety of carbohydrate recognising proteins such as the galactins w22,23x, serum amyloid protein w24x, the lectin-like domains Wing-1 and Wing-2 attached to the catalytic domain of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase w25x and Charcot≠Leyden crystal protein w26x. The topology of the legume lectin fold, which is shown in Fig. 1Zb. , is complex and is structurally related to the jelly-roll topology commonly found in viral coat proteins w27,28x. The architecture of the legume lectin monomer is usually described as consisting of two b-sheets. As was

pointed out by Banerjee and co-workers, the correct description involves three b-sheets: the 6-stranded back sheet, the 7-stranded front sheet and a smaller 5-stranded sheet Zwhich we will call the S-sheet. , that plays a major role in holding the two large sheets together w14x. The main hydrophobic core is located between the back and the front sheet. No a-helix is present and about 50% of the residues are in loop regions. One of these loops Zan V-loop containing the conserved glycine of the monosaccharide binding site ≠ see below. curls over the front sheet, resulting in the formation of a second hydrophobic core between the front sheet and this loop. Carbohydrate binding activity of legume lectins depends on the simultaneous presence of both a calcium and a transition metal ion. These metal binding sites were first described in detail for concanavalin A w29x and have been found to be extremely well conserved in all other legume lectin structures. A schematic drawing of the metal binding sites in concanavalin A is given in Fig. 2Z b. . The calcium ∞ and the transition metal ion are approximately 4.5 A apart and bridged by two aspartate residues. Both metals have four protein ligands and two water ligands. One of the water ligands from the calcium ion forms a bridge with the carbonyl group of an aspartate residue Z Asp208 in concanavalin A. that is preceded by a cis-peptide bond.

Recently, the structure of demetallised concana∞ valin A has been refined at 2.5 A resolution and the structures of several intermediate steps in the remetallisation process have been presented w30,31x. As predicted by earlier NMRD measurements w32x, the key event in the metal-induced activation of concanavalin A is the trans to cis isomerisation of an Ala≠Asp peptide bond. The metal binding region in

concanavalin A is partly unfolded upon demetallisation, and the conformations of several loops in the demetallised structure seem to depend on packing contacts. No calcium binding site is present in demetallised concanavalin A, but a proto-transition metal binding site is formed by the side chains of residues Glu8, Asp10 and His24 Z Fig. 2Z b.. . This metal-free conformation is called the `unlocked' form of ConA,

while the active, metal-bound conformation is called the `locked' form. Binding of zinc or cobalt in this proto-site initially leads to the movement of Asp19 and to an ordering of the loop Pro13≠Pro23, which is

partly disordered in the structure of apo-concanavalin A, but overall the protein stays in its unlocked apo conformation. Solution NMRD studies showed that about 10% of the molecules in demetallised concana-

valin A are in the locked conformation Zcapable of carbohydrate recognition. and that this percentage can increase significantly in the presence of high concentrations of mannose w33,34x. Thus, locked and unlocked conformations are in equilibrium and calcium Zbut also to a lesser extent manganese and

cadmium. stabilises the locked conformation w35,36x. Indeed, presence of a metal bound in the calcium binding site is essential for observing a native conformation for the loops Pro13≠Pro23 and Thr97≠Glu102 of the metal and carbohydrate binding region and for observing a cis-peptide bond between Ala207 and Asp208 in crystal structures of concanavalin A. The all-or-nothing conformational transition observed in the remetallisation process of concanavalin A thus resembles to a certain extent protein folding, in the sense that one goes from an essentially unfolded and flexible metal binding region in the apo structure to a unique well ordered structure in the metal-bound form of the protein. The time constants in the concanavalin A system are, however, much larger than those observed for the folding of small globular proteins, due to the large energy barrier provided by the requirement of a cis≠trans isomerisation step of an Ala≠Asp peptide bond. In this context, it is noteworthy that binding of monosaccharides to concanavalin A stabilises its native conformation and protects against chaotropic agents such as urea w146x. Since high concentrations of mannose are also capable of shifting the locked≠ unlocked equilibrium towards the locked conformation in the absence of metal ions w34x, this stabilisation can be explained. The unlocked structure can be considered as partly unfolded, and saccharide binding therefore stabilises a conformation that has a higher degree of folding. The legume lectin family also contains two proteins with no known carbohydrate recognition activity that do not possess the otherwise strictly conserved metal binding sites: the a-amylase inhibitor Z a-AI. from Phaseolus ’ulgaris w37,145x and arcelin, a seed defence protein found in certain wild accesFig. 2.

sions of the same plant w38x. Both proteins show about 50≠60% sequence identity to the two lectins from Phaseolus ’ulgaris PHA-L and PHA-E. The crystal structures of arcelin variant 5a and a-AI variant 1, as well as that of PHA-L have recently

been solved w8,18,19x. Both a-AI and arcelin lack the loop corresponding to residues Pro13 to Pro23 in concanavalin A. Also, most of the other residues that in other legume lectins play a role in metal and carbohydrate binding are not conserved ZTable 3 and

Fig. 3.. No bound metals are observed in the crystal structure of arcelin or a-AI. Nevertheless, in arcelin Tyr85, the residue corresponding to the cis-aspartate in the other legume lectins, is also preceded by a cis peptide bond w19x. This contrasts with the results obtained on demetallised concanavalin A and suggests that calcium binding is one way, but not the only way in which this particular cis peptide bond can be stabilised. Stabilising interactions include stacking between the aromatic rings of Tyr85 and Phe127 and two main chain ≠ main chain hydrogen bonds ZAla84 NH to Thr205 O and Gly207 NH to Ala84 O.. The presence of this unusual and unpredicted cis-peptide was interpreted in terms of the possible involvement of Tyr85 in an active role in the defence function of this protein. The lectin-related a-amylase inhibitor from Phaseolus ’ulgaris Z a-AI. shows an even larger truncation of the loops involved in metal- and monosaccharide binding by ordinary legume lectins w37,145x. In the recent structure of a-AI in complex with porcine pancreatic a-amylase, no cis-peptide is observed, although the binding site for porcine aamylase is located in the same region of the protein as the carbohydrate binding sites in the lectins and the putative active site in arcelin w18x. 3. Quaternary structure 3.1. The canonical legume lectin dimer Lectins were originally defined as carbohydrate binding proteins from non-immune origin that are able to agglutinate cells or to precipitate complex carbohydrates, without having any enzymatic activity towards their carbohydrate ligands w39,40x. As a consequence, legume lectins have multiple binding sites and indeed, they are found to form dimers and tetramers. The only known exception to this rule in the legume lectin family is arcelin 5a, the lectin-related defence protein from Phaseolus ’ulgaris, which has no known carbohydrate binding potential. Although originally identified as a dimer at pH 7.0, its recently determined crystal structure showed a monomer. Most known legume lectins contain a structure termed the `canonical legume lectin dimer'. This dimer, which was first described for concanavalin A and pea lectin, is characterised by a large 12-stranded

b-sheet resulting from the association of the two 6-stranded back sheets Z Fig. 4. w6,7,9x. Further contacts occur through side chain≠side chain and side chain≠main chain interactions of residues 14b to 17b, the hydrated b-bulge from residues 46b to 49b in the front sheet and residues 90b and 18a Zpea lectin numbering.. In pea lectin, lentil lectin as well as Lathyrus lectin, the dimer interface is quite hydrophyllic and contains a number of buried water molecules w41x. Within a single species, the positions of these water molecules are well conserved, as is evident from an analysis of different crystal forms of lentil lectin and Lathyrus lectin. However, these waters are only poorly conserved among lectins from different species and are modulated by point mutations at the interface, and also by disturbances from perfect 2-fold symmetry by strong packing interactions, as demonstrated by the crystal structure of pea lectin. 3.2. Other dimers Two dimeric lectins of known structure do not form the canonical legume lectin dimer. These are the lectins from coral tree Z Erythrina corallodendron. w16x and lectin IV from Griffonia simplicifolia w17x. These structures are compared with the canonical dimer in Fig. 4. In the case of the E. corallodendron lectin, it was suggested that the canonical dimer cannot be formed due to sterical hindrance from a carbohydrate covalently bound to Asn17 w16x. An alternative dimer is formed with a buried surface of ∞ only 700 A2 per monomer, compared to the about ∞ 1100 A2 buried in the interface of the canonical dimer. GS-IV forms a heterodimer, with both monomers differing in their covalently bound carbohydrates: Asn5 is glycosylated in only one of the two while Asn18 is glycosylated in both w17x. Inter-subunit interactions consist of side chain≠side chain and side chain≠main chain interactions as well as water bridges between residues Ser71, Thr159≠Arg160, Thr177≠ Thr186, Ile198≠Ser200 and Asp239, with a buried ∞ surface area of 900 A2 per subunit. Formation of the canonical dimer is thought not to be impaired by the glycosylation state. Instead, formation of the standard dimer may be prevented because this would bury a charged residue ZGlu58. in the subunit interface. The corresponding residue in the lentil lectin dimer is Thr48b and is located close to the local dyad axis

relating the two subunits in the canonical dimer. In the lentil lectin dimer, the Thr48 side chains from both subunits hydrogen bond to each other, while in the homologous pea and Lathyrus lectin interfaces the corresponding Ser48b are differently oriented, resulting in a different solvent network in the interfaces of these two proteins. Formation of a canonical GS-IV dimer would thus bring two negatively charged ∞ groups within 4 A from each other. Furthermore, in a

canonical dimer environment, the side chain of Glu58 would clash with the side chain of Tyr56 of the other monomer. 3.3. The concana’alin A tetramer The quaternary structure of concanavalin A is pH dependent, the protein being tetrameric above pH 7.0 and dimeric below pH 5.0 w42x. The dimer formed at

low pH is the canonical dimer, and at neutral or higher pH two such dimers associate with their back sheets w30,43x. This structure is shown in Fig. 5Za.. Because of the concave course of the back b-sheets, the centre of the tetramer is formed by a large ∞ water-filled cavity of about 25 = 25 = 8 A3. Several charged and ionisable side chains are buried upon tetramer formation, some of which are involved in salt-bridges. Interestingly, the tetramer interface also contains two pairs of arginines Z Arg60 from each of the four subunits. in close contact. In the structure of demetallised concanavalin A at pH 5.0 they actually are involved a stacking interaction with each other w30x. All known crystal structures of concanavalin A have been obtained around pH 7 w20,44≠47x, except for demetallised concanavalin A and its monometallised Co 2q- and Zn2q-derivatives, that were crystallised at pH 5 w30,31,48x. Although dimeric in solution, demetallised concanavalin A, through crystal packing interactions, forms in the crystal a tetramer very similar to that observed at pH 7.0. The

number of van der Waals and hydrogen bonding contacts between the two dimers is, however, drastically reduced w48x. This reduction in inter-dimer interactions can largely be explained by the different protonation state of aspartates and glutamates at the interface. The different crystal forms of concanavalin A Znative, a mannose complex and two trimannoside complexes. and the almost identical lectin from Cana’alia brasiliensis Ztwo amino acid substitutions of which one on the interface between the two canonical dimers. have shown that the structure of the concanavalin A type tetramer is variable to some extent w45,49≠51x. The two dimers may rotate several degrees relative to each other and may even show a small relative translation, leading to a different hydrogen bonding scheme on the dimer≠dimer interface. In the concanavalin A≠trimannoside complex w49x, a small relative rotation of the two monomers in the canonical dimers is observed as well. This suggests the concanavalin A tetramer to be a dynamical structure in solution.

3.4. The peanut agglutinin tetramer Peanut lectin Z Arachis hypogaea ≠ PNA. was the second tetrameric lectin of which the structure was determined. Although its crystallisation was reported ∞ as early as 1982, a structure refined at 2.2 A was only described recently w13,14x. Despite its homology with other known legume lectins, this structure could only be solved using isomorphous replacement. The peanut lectin tetramer can be considered to consist of two GS-IV type dimers Z Fig. 4. . Two monomers, one from each of these GS-IV type dimers, then associate in a fashion similar but not identical to the canonical dimer, resulting in the only known tetrameric protein that does neither contain 4-fold or 222 symmetry. However, no continuous 12-stranded b-sheet is formed along the dimer interface. Instead, the two N-terminal strands of the two monomers that associate in the canonical dimer-like fashion are intercalated by a series of 6 water bridges. The PNA tetramer is thus unique among all homotetrameric proteins in the sense that its internal symmetry does not lead to a closed point group. It should also be noted here that peanut agglutinin is not a glycoprotein. Therefore, its unique quaternary structure cannot be due to steric effects of covalently bound carbohydrate and must be due to intrinsic properties of the protein itself as coded into its amino acid sequence. Modelling studies on the concanavalin A and peanut agglutinin tetramers w14x suggested that the deciding factor in the choice of the type of subunit association might be the amount of non-polar surface area buried upon oligomerisation. 3.5. The PHA r SBA tetramer: an adenine binding motif? The tetramers of soybean agglutinin ZSBA. w15x and the leuko-agglutinin from Phaseolus ’ulgaris ZPHA-L. w8x have in common with concanavalin A that they also consist of two canonical dimers. The resulting tetramers are, however, distinctly different ZFig. 5Zb... Tetramer formation is not pH dependent for PHA-L and SBA. In the PHA-L and SBA tetramers, the two curved 12-stranded back sheets interact with their two outmost strands, creating a large channel in the middle of the tetramer. This channel probably contains the disordered C-terminus of these lectins and protects it from proteolyic degradation.

The interface formed by these two outmost strands consists mainly of a number of relatively short side chains that intercalate in a zipper-like fashion, an architecture which is unusual for b-sheet packing. Many legume lectins contain, in addition to their carbohydrate binding site, one or more binding sites for hydrophobic ligands w52≠54x. Of special interest here is the binding of adenine and adenine-related plant hormones w55≠59x. Not all legume lectins contain an adenine binding site, but those that do recognise adenine and certain adenine-related cytokinins with an affinity of 10y5 ≠10y6 M, i.e. several orders of magnitude stronger than their affinities for monosaccharides and even oligosaccharides w57≠59x. Structural data on these lectin hormone interactions is limited, but it has been determined that the stoichiometry is either one or two binding sites per tetramer w54,58x. Affinity labelling experiments identified amino acid residues neighbouring the binding site and thus allowed for a crude localisation of the adenine binding site on the PHA-L tetramer as a 2-fold symmetric binding site on the interface between different monomers in the tetramer, inside the central hole of the tetramer w8x. The broad location of this binding site is shown in Fig. 5Z b. . The PHArSBA tetramer has recently been observed in the crystal structures of Vicia ’illosa lectin w147x as well as for the seed lectin of Dolichos biflorus and lectin II of Ulex europaeus Zour unpublished results.. Of these, the Dolichos biflorus lectin is known to bind adenine, while in the case of Vicia ’illosa and Ulex europaeus adenine binding has never been investigated. The PHArSBA tetramer seems thus to be the default or canonical tetramer, while the concanavalin A and peanut agglutinin tetramers are the exceptions. 3.6. Post-translational processing Legume lectins are generally synthesised as a precursor, which subsequently Z after an initial removal of an N-terminal signal peptide. is post-translationally processed into a mature protein. This post-translational processing may consist of proteolytic cleavage of the precursor chain w60x, C-terminal trimming w62≠64x, removal of covalent carbohydrate w65,66x and even ligation of the original C- and N-termini w67,68x. Depending on each specific lectin, the differ-

20

ent precursors may or may not possess carbohydrate binding activity. Undoubtedly, the most complex and intriguing type of processing is the chain of events leading to a circularly permuted structure in concanavalin A w67,68x. After removal of a signal peptide followed by deglycosylation w69x, a loop segment is removed in the middle of the sequence, presumably by an asparagine-specific protease w70,71x. In about two thirds of the molecules, the original N- and C-termini are then ligated, resulting in a circularly permuted protein w67,68x. This relegation was recently shown to be catalysed by jack bean asparaginyl endopeptidase w72x. Another well known form of post-translational processing is the one giving rise to the so-called two-chain lectins of the Vicieae tribe. Here, an amino acid segment of 6 residues is cut out of the pro-lectin, resulting in a protein containing a short C-terminal a-chain and a long N-terminal b-chain. Examples are the lectins from pea, lentil, broad bean and Lathyrus species w60,61x. Less well known is that many so-called single chain lectins that do not undergo the above processing contain ragged C-terminal ends, as determined by mass spectrometry. Examples are soybean agglutinin, PHA-E and the lectins from Dolichos biflorus w62≠ 64x. This phenomenon has also been observed for recombinant lectins expressed in E. Coli w64x. Some of these lectins were shown to consist of an apparent equimolar mixture of long and short variants. In the case of the Dolichos biflorus seed lectin and the closely related stem and leaf lectin, it has been suggested that C-terminal truncation of half of the subunits of the respective tetramer and dimer is essential for carbohydrate binding activity and that only the untruncated subunits recognise carbohydrates w73x. The molecular basis of this phenomenon is not known, but may be related to the quaternary structure of these proteins. A more detailed explanation probably will have to await the determination of the crystal structure of these two lectins. 3.7. Relationship between oligosaccharide specificity and quaternary structure Many plant lectins, covering a wide range of carbohydrate specificities, have been shown to pre-

cipitate glycoproteins and branched multivalent oligosaccharides w74x. This precipitation process often leads to the formation of homogeneous cross-linked lattices of a crystalline nature and in some cases leads to macroscopic crystals w75≠77x. The earlier mentioned structure of soybean agglutinin in complex with the biantennary analogue of the blood group I carbohydrate antigen Galb1≠4-GlcNAcbwGalb1≠4GlcNAcb x-Galb-OZCH 2 . 5 COOCH 3 is such an example w15x. This type of lectin≠carbohydrate interaction is extremely specific as in mixed precipitation systems, distinct and homogeneous lattices can be observed, even if the individual monovalent constituents of the carbohydrate or glycoprotein are bound only with weak affinity w78x. This type of interaction thus represents a new source of binding specificity with a high biological relevancy w79,80x. Binding of multivalent lectins to the surface of cells often leads to cross-linking and aggregation of specific glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors, which in turn is associated with a variety of biological responses such as mitogenic activities and a variety of biological signal transduction processes. The formation of homogeneous lattices can in part be explained by the multimeric nature of the lectins. As discussed previously, different lectins possess different types of quaternary structures, independent of their specificity for monosaccharides. The different spacings between the carbohydrate binding sites of the different lectins combined with specific distances between the different epitopes on multivalent ligands are probably the reason for this type of specificity. This is in agreement with observations on other interacting systems such as the interaction of cholera toxin B with the GM1 ganglioside in a lipid layer and actin interacting with actin-cross-linking proteins w79,80x.

4. Molecular basis of carbohydrate specificity In the following paragraphs, we will give a detailed description of the structural basis of mono- and oligosaccharide binding to legume lectins. Important similarities and differences between the different lectins will be highlighted. Because of the circular homology between concanavalin A and the other lectins and because the carbohydrate binding residues

are distributed over several loops, the equivalent residues for the lectins that are discussed below are given in Table 4. These equivalences are based on superpositons of the different coordinate files Zobtained from X-ray crystallography or molecular modelling. , except for Lima bean lectin, GS-II and Ulex europaeus lectin II, where no three-dimensional coordinates were available. For these three lectins, the equivalent residues were determined by aligning the published amino acid sequences. 4.1. Glc r Man specific lectins 4.1.1. Concana’alin A: an extended binding site Concanavalin A, the lectin from Jack bean Z Cana’alia ensiformis. was the first legume lectin to be isolated w81x, sequenced w82,83x and its three dimensional structure determined by X-ray crystallography w6,7x. The structure of a concanavalin A ≠ ∞ methyl a-D-mannopyranoside complex at 2.9 A resolution in 1989 provided the first detailed view on how a legume lectin specifically interacts with a monosaccharide w84x. This complex has recently been ∞ refined at 2.0 A w46x and the interactions in the binding site are typical for all legume lectin carbohydrate complexes elucidated by X-ray crystallography to date. The essential interactions involve key hydrogen bonds with three extremely well conserved residues: an aspartate Z Asp208. that is preceded by a cis-peptide bond and is held in place via a water bridge with a structural calcium ion, an asparagine Z Asn14. that directly interacts with this calcium and the backbone NH of Arg228, which in most other legume lectin sequences is a glycine and which also interacts with the calcium ion via a water bridge with its backbone oxygen ZFigs. 6 and 7.. Also essential are van der Waals interactions between aromatic residues Z Tyr12 in concanavalin A, but often also Phe and sometimes Leu or Cys. and the sugar ring. Further interactions involve a loop segment ZThr97≠Glu102., of which the conformation and length is variable among the known legume lectin structures and that is not in contact with the calcium ion. Conformational changes in the binding site of concanavalin A upon saccharide binding are small, in contrast to the large differences between holo- and apo-concanavalin A. Two differences between the complexed and the uncomplexed structures are never-

theless significant. The first one concerns a movement of the side chain of Arg228. In all structures of uncomplexed concanavalin A, this side chain partially blocks the monosaccharide binding site. This has been related to the apparent co-operativity of the binding of Mana1≠3wMana1≠6xMan-a-Me by concanavalin A, which may have a dynamic origin, as is suggested by recent calorimetric studies w85≠87x. It can however not be excluded that the observed blocking of the binding site by Arg228 results from crystal packing forces, since the crystal form of uncomplexed concanavalin A is densely packed. Most other legume lectins have a glycine at the position of Arg228. The second conformational change concerns ∞ a small movement Z about 0.5 A. of the loop Thr97≠ Glu102. Strikingly, in all other legume lectins where both a complexed and uncomplexed structure are ∞ available, small movements Z- 1.0 A. of the corresponding loop are observed upon carbohydrate binding. The effect of the presence of a bulky hydrophobic substituent on O1 of mannose and glucose has been investigated w88,89x. In the complexes of concanavalin A with 4X-nitrophenyl a-D-mannopyranoside and 4X-nitrophenyl a-D-glucopyranoside the nitrophenyl group hydrogen bonds to the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr100, and makes favourable hydrophobic interactions with side chain atoms of Tyr12, Leu99 and Tyr100 ZFig. 7. . Concanavalin A, as well as the closely related lectin from Dioclea grandiflora, has its highest affinity for the trimannosyl core Mana1≠3wMana1≠6x Man found in N-glycans w90,91x. Recently, two groups independently determined the structure of a complex between concanavalin A and the trimannoside w49,92x. The terminal mannose on the a1≠6 arm is bound in the monosaccharide binding site, in a way similar as observed in the concanavalin A ≠ methyl a-D-mannopyranoside complex. The reducing core mannose and the a1≠3 terminal mannose are bound in an extension of this primary site Z Fig. 8Za.. . The core mannose interacts with the side chains of Tyr100 and Asp16 via its O4 and O2 oxygens respectively. These results are consistent with recent thermodynamic data on the concanavalin A ≠ trimannosyl system w93,94x. Both published structures agree with each other on the interactions between the core mannose and the

as the other trimannose molecules in the asymmetric unit. Concanavalin A also has a high affinity for structures containing Mana1≠2-Man linkages. No crystallographic or NMR data is available, but molecular modelling has been attempted with the disaccharide Mana1≠2-Man w95x. From this study, it was concluded that the non-reducing mannose most likely occupies the monosaccharide binding site, while the reducing mannose interacts with the side chains of Asn14 and Arg228.

In the structure reported by Naismith and Field, all trimannose molecules are bound in the same conformation, while Loris and co-workers observed two conformations for the a Z1≠3. connection. Interestingly, these two conformations resulted from the same hydroxyls interacting with the protein. The existence of two conformations in a ligand that is considered a specific binder is unusual and was therefore extensively verified using the experimental data. Despite the convincing electron density for this situation, no satisfying explanation could be found as to why this is the case. In fact, the trimannose molecule with the alternative conformation is not involved in crystal packing interactions and seems not to be prevented in any way to adopt the same conformation

4.1.2. Mimicri between carbohydrate and peptide recognition. A couple of years ago, it was reported by two groups that peptides binding to the carbohydrate binding site of concanavalin A could be isolated from a random peptide library w148,149x. These peptides bind to concanavalin A with an affinity similar to that of methyl a-D-glucopyrannoside and inhibit dextran precipitation of concanavalin A. Conversely, monosaccharides such as a-D-mannopyrannoside inhibit peptide binding. These peptides, that contain the consensus sequence Tyr≠Pro≠Tyr, do not bind to other closely related GlcrMan specific legume lectins indicating interactions both with the monosaccharide binding site and some surrounding residues that are not conserved within the GlcrMan specificity group. On the other hand, anti-DVFYPYPYASGS antibodies recognise carbohydrate ligands and anti-a-D-man-

nopyrannoside antibodies recognise the peptide DVFYPYPYASGS that also binds to the carbohydrate binding site of concanavalin A w150x. This situation is analogous to the mimicri found between the cytokeratin peptide SFGSGFGGY and N-acetyl b-D-glucosamine w151x. Also here, antibodies against GlcNac and the peptide are interchangeable and the peptide is recognised by some GlcNac-specific lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin.

4.1.3. Vicieae lectins: ’ariations on a theme Crystal structures of the lectins from fava bean Z Vicia faba., pea Z Pisum sati’um. , lentil Z Lens culinaris . and two isolectins from Lathyrus Z Lathyrus ochrus ≠ LOL I and LOL II. with monosaccharides have shown that these very homologous lectins Z over 85% pairwise sequence identity. bind mannose and glucose in a way essentially identical to concanavalin A w96≠99x.

In the case of LOL I, the effect of an aglycon on enhanced affinity was studied in the complexes with N-acetylmuramic acid and a N-acetylmuramyl dipeptide ZMur-D-Ala-D-iGln ≠ MDP.. It was found that the aglycon of both compounds interacts with the side chains of Tyr100b and Trp128b and with residues Gly97b≠Gly98b of LOL w100x. These are the same residues that according to a recent molecular modelling study are responsible for the enhanced affinity of lentil lectin for 2-O- and 3-O-m-nitro-benzyl derivatives of mannose and glucose as illustrated in Fig. 9Za. w101x. This hydrophobic subsite is different from the one described above for concanavalin A, which cannot bind mannoses or glucoses containing substituents on O3 w102x. The binding of sugar residues extending from the mannose or glucose in the monosaccharide binding site is however fundamentally different from what is seen in concanavalin A. Sugar residues immediately attached to the mannose or glucose in the monosaccharide binding site are either not visible as in the complex of pea lectin with the trimannoside core w98x, or only interact with the protein via an extended water network, as found in a sucrose complex of lentil lectin w99x and the complex of Lathyrus lectin with a trisaccharide w103x. This is in agreement with the affinities of lentil, pea and Lathyrus lectin for these oligosaccharides being similar to their affinities for a-D-mannopyranoside. In all cases, the carbohydrates are in a low Zbut not necessary the lowest. energy conformation w105x and are involved in or located close to crystal lattice interactions. Crystal packing forces nevertheless seem to have little influence on the interaction between the lectin and the oligosaccharide, as shown in an extensive study of the lentil lectin≠sucrose interaction that compared results from crystallography, solution NMR and molecular modelling w99x. The conformation of the sucrose molecule, which is known to be highly flexible in solution, as well as the mode of interaction were found to be essentially identical when studied with the three techniques. In contrast to concanavalin A, the Vicieae lectins have not significantly enhanced affinity for the trimannose core over a-D-mannopyranoside w91,106x. This can be explained by comparing the trimannoside complex of concanavalin A with the different oligosaccharide complexes of Lathyrus lectin w103,104x.

LOL Zand also pea and lentil lectin. lacks the functional groups that in the concanavalin A trimannoside structures interact with the core mannose: Tyr12 and Tyr100 in concanavalin A are substituted by Phe123b and Glu31a in LOL. As a consequence, the trimannoside cannot bind in the same orientation in LOL as in concanavalin A w92x. This is illustrated in Fig. 8Zb. and Zc.. Instead, the a1≠3 linked mannose binds in the monosaccharide binding site. The conformations of the a1≠3 and a1≠6 linkages in the LOL complexes are variable and depend on the exact nature of the longer oligosaccharide w100x. Lectins from the Vicieae tribe show a high affinity for N-acetyllactosamine-type glycans that have a fucose residue a1≠6 linked to the N-linked Nacetylglucosamine w91,106x. The structural basis of this specificity is explained by two recent crystal structures of LOL complexed with fragment N2 of human lactotransferrin and with an isolated biantennary glycopeptide w107x. The fucose residue was found to be bound in a subsite, interacting with Phe123b and Glu31a , i.e. the same residues that in concanavalin A are responsible for its specificity for the trimannose core. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 8Zc. , the position of this fucose roughly coincides with that of the terminal 1≠3 mannose residue in the concanavalin A≠trimannose complexes. In absence of the fucose, the affinity of the lectins from the Vicieae tribe Z LOL, favin, lentil, lectin and pea lectin. for the lactotransferrin-derived oligosaccharide is somewhat lower, but still about 100-fold higher than for the monosaccharides w91x. This is explained by the crystal structure of a LOL≠octasaccharide complex w104x, in which the non-fucosylated lactotransferrin-derived octasaccharide adopts a conformation upon binding to LOL that is different from the one adopted in complex of LOL with the fucosylated biantennary glycopeptide w107x. Recently, it was shown that both the fucosylated and the non-fucosylated biantennary glycans are highly flexible molecules and that upon complex formation, the Vicieae lectins select out a conformation that is already present in solution w155x. The differences in conformation of the fucosylated and non-fucosylated biantennary oligosaccharides bound to LOL as seen in the different crystal structures are therefore not due to inherently different solution conformations of these oligosaccharides, but rather due to a different lectin-mediated selection of a

legume Bowringia milbraedii w108,109x. Of these, only for the B. milbraedii lectin has a detailed study on sugar specificity been published w110x. This lectin differs from the other ManrGlc specific lectins in that it is only poorly inhibited by glucose, and not at all by methyl b-D-glucopyranoside and has a high affinity for structures containing Mana1≠2-Man linkages. B. milbraedii on the other hand does not seem to have a specific binding site for the trimannoside core Mana1≠3wMana1≠6xMan w110x. 4.2. Gal r Galnac specific lectins 4.2.1. Structural features of galactose complexes The amount of structural data available for the GalrGalNAc specific legume lectins is also growing steadily. At present, the structures of four legume lectins with a galactose residue in the monosaccharide binding site have been refined: E. corallodendron lectin in complex with lactose w16x, peanut agglutinin in complex with lactose w14x and the T-antigen disaccharide w152x, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin IV ZGS-IV. complexed with the Lewis b tetrasaccharide Fuc a1≠2-Galb1≠3wFuca1≠4xGlcNAcb-Me w17x and a cross-linked lattice between soybean agglutinin Z Glycine max . and the biantennary pentasaccharide analogue of the blood group I carbohydrate antigen Galb1 ≠ 4-GlcNAc b w Galb1 ≠ 4-GlcNAc b x -GalbOZCH 2 . 5 COOCH 3 w15x. Of these complexes, the GSIV complex is special in the sense that GS-IV does not bind free galactose or GalNAc w111x. GS-IV thus belongs sensu stricto to the complex specificity group and will be discussed in detail later. From the structures of E. corallodendron lectin, peanut agglutinin and soybean agglutinin, it can be seen that the hydrogen bonding network in the binding site in the presence of galactose is similar to the one found for the mannose-binding lectins. Since mannose and galactose differ in the orientation of their C4 hydroxyl Zaxial or equatorial., the orientation of galactose in the binding site needs to be different from the one of mannose, as first pointed out by Shaanan et al. w16x and further discussed by Sharon w153x. As can be seen in Fig. 6, this results in the conserved Asp≠ Asn≠Gly triad interacting with O4 and O6 in the GlcrMan specific lectins and with O3 and O4 in the Gal specific lectins. A similar situation is found for glucose bound to the glucosergalactose binding pro-

tein from E. coli w112x, as compared to the galactose orientation in the L-arabinose binding protein w113x. The mode of binding of galactose is essentially identical in the structures of E. corallodendron lectin and soybean agglutinin. In neither of these structures, direct hydrogen bonds are observed with another carbohydrate residue than the galactose in the monosaccharide bonding site. A major difference between E. corallodendron lectin and soybean agglutinin on the one hand and peanut agglutinin on the other involves the loop Thr216≠Glu224 Z Erythrina numbering., the conformation of which is strikingly different in the peanut structures w14x. Although similar hydrogen bonds are formed with the conserved Asp≠Asn≠Gly triad in peanut agglutinin, the exact position of the galactose residue in the monosaccharide binding site of peanut agglutinin is shifted somewhat on the peanut agglutinin structure compared to soybean agglutinin and E. corallodendron lectin. All available crystal structures contain a galactose in their monosaccharide binding site and therefore do not explain the higher affinity of most of these lectins for GalNAc. In order to understand this, Imberty and co-workers modelled the Zstrictly. GalNAc specific seed lectin from Dolichos biflorus ZDBL. and used this structure to dock various saccharides, including GalNAc w114x. It was proposed that the carbonyl oxygen of the N-acetyl group of GalNAc hydrogen bonds to the main chain NH group of Gly103, while the methyl group forms favourable van der Waals interactions with the aromatic side chains of Tyr104 and Trp132 ZFig. 9Zb.. . These results have been corroborated by a recent NMR study on the interaction between DBL and the Forssman pentasaccharide GalNAc a1≠3-GalNAcb1≠3-Gala1≠4-Galb1≠4-Glc w115x. In this study, intermolecular NOE's between the protein and the carbohydrate ligand could be observed for the terminal GalNAc residue that indeed suggest that the N-acetylamine group interacts with Tyr104 and Trp132. The blood group A trisaccharide GalNAca1≠ 3wFuca1≠2x-Gal occurs in solution in two main conformational populations. In the same modelling study involving the Dolichos biflorus seed lectin w114x, it could not be determined with certainty which of the two conformations binds to the lectin. This ambiguity was resolved using an NMR study on the DBL-blood group A trisaccharide complex w116x. Combination of

the modelling and NMR studies indicate that when bound to DBL, the O4 hydroxyl of the fucose residue hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbonyl of Ser128. This residue corresponds to Tyr124b in the Vicieae lectins and Pro13 in concanavalin A. It is therefore of relevance that in the concanavalin A≠trimannoside complexes, the carbonyl of Pro13 also hydrogen bonds with the 1≠3 terminal mannose residue. Further van der Waals contacts are observed between the fucose and Leu127, the equivalent of Phe123b in the Vicieae lectins and Tyr12 in concanavalin A. These results strongly suggest similar interactions not only in the monosaccharide binding sites of lectins with different specificities, but also in a conserved subsite responsible for high affinity binding of oligosaccharides. The structural basis of oligosaccharide specificity was also investigated for the E. corallodendron lectin w117x. This lectin has a high affinity for Fuca1≠2Galb1≠4-GlcNAcb-terminated glycosphingolipids. Modelling studies with this trisaccharide suggest that the a1≠2-linked fucose binds in a cavity extending from the monosaccharide binding site. In this cavity, the fucose residue forms hydrophobic contacts with Pro134 and Trp135, as well as hydrogen bonds with the NH2 group of Asn133 Zto the 2-OH of fucose as well as to the glycosidic linkage. , NH of Gly107 Zto the 2-OH of fucose. and the hydroxyl group of Tyr108 Zto the 3-OH of fucose. . These residues correspond to those that form the so-called ``hydrophobic binding site'' adjacent to the monosaccharide binding site in both the ManrGlc Zsee above. and Gal Zsee below. specific lectins Z Fig. 9Zc.. . Very recently, the complex of peanut agglutinin with the T-antigen disaccharide Z Galb1≠3GalNac. provided the first crystallographic data of a galactose specific legume lectin recognising an oligosaccharide that binds with an affinity that is significantly better than the lectin's affinity for Gal or GalNAc w152x. This structure is remarkable because it suggests that the 20-fold increase in affinity compared to lactose is entirely due to water-mediated protein≠carbohydrate interactions, the amount of direct protein≠carbohydrate hydrogen bonds and non-polar contacts being identical Z Fig. 10.. While specific water-mediated recognition has been observed previously in protein≠ DNA interactions, the peanut agglutinin-T-antigen disaccharide complex for the first time shows that

water-mediated specificity is also possible for carbohydrate recognition. 4.2.2. Site directed mutagenesis The galactose specific lectins are also the only ones for which their specificity has been successfully modulated by site directed mutagenesis. The lectin from E. corallodendron has a 500-fold higher affinity for galactoses containing a bulky substituent on C2, such as dansylamido Z NDns. compared to the unsubstituted monosaccharide w118x, and also a 2-fold higher affinity for GalNAc than for galactose w119x. In contrast, the affinity of peanut agglutinin for GalNAc is 5 times lower than for galactose, and its affinity for MebGalNDns is only 20-fold higher than

Fig. 10. Schematic diagrams of the binding of lactose Za. and the T-antigen disaccharide Zb. to peanut agglutinin. The main difference between both complexes are the additional water-mediated interactions between the protein and the N-acetyl group of the GalNAc residue in the T-antigen disaccharide. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines and water molecules are indicated by ``W''.

for galactose w120x. The structure of the E. corallodendron lectin revealed an hydrophobic cavity near the C2 carbon of the bound galactose which was thought to be responsible for its affinity for galactoses containing substituents on C2. This cavity is formed by Tyr108, Pro134 and Trp135. Arango and co-workers substituted the dipeptide Pro≠Trp by the corresponding tetrapeptide Ser≠Glu≠Tyr≠Asn found in the related sequence of peanut agglutinin w121x. This resulted in a recombinant lectin with an unchanged affinity for galactose, a slightly diminished affinity for GalNAc and a markedly lower affinity for MebGalNDns. This change in specificity could be rationalised as resulting from steric hindrance by the two additional amino acids present in the cavity region of the mutant. Similar results were obtained by Jordan and Goldstein, who modified the binding site of lima bean Z Phaseolus lunatus . lectin, another GalrGalNAc specific lectin for which at the moment no crystal structure is available w122x. This lectin has its highest affinity for the blood group A immunodominant trisaccharide GalNAca1≠3wFuca1≠2xGalb1-R. Two lima bean lectin mutants showed altered specificity for C2 substituents on the galactose residue of this trisaccharide: the mutant His128Pro recognised GalNAca1≠3-GalNAc while the Cys127Tyr mutant showed specificity for both GalNAca1≠3-Gal and GalNAca1≠4-Gal Z with a necessity for a free hydroxyl group at the C2 position of Gal. . It is of interest to note here that Cys127 corresponds to Tyr12 in concanavalin A and Phe123b in Lathyrus ochrus lectin, suggesting again that the same residues or loops that are responsible for determining the oligosaccharide specificity in the ManrGlc specific lectins have a similar role in the GalrGalNAc specificity group. Interestingly, the same is true for the three residues that make up the above mentioned hydrophobic cavity. Both Tyr108 and Trp135 are conserved in the lentil, pea and Lathyrus sequences Zas Tyr100b and Trp128b . and were identified as the amino acids responsible for the higher affinity of mannoses and glucoses with hydrophobic substituents on C2 or C3 w101x. In the Dolichos biflorus seed lectin, these residues correspond to Tyr104 and Trp132, which were proposed to be responsible for interacting favourably with the N-acetyl group of GalNAc w114x.

4.2.3. Determinants of galactose and mannose specificity As has been discussed, both the GlcrMan and the GalrGalNAc specificity group lectins seem to make similar hydrogen bonds between the monosaccharide and the protein upon binding. Indeed, the key hydrogen bonding partners belong to the conserved core of residues identified by Young and Oomen w123x. Therefore, despite the well-known directionality of hydrogen bonds, hydrogen bonding does not seem to be an important determinant for the selectivity of the recognition process. When the structures of the GlcrMan specific complexes are optimally superimposed onto the complex of the E. corallodendron lectin with lactose, it becomes clear that also the shapes of the monosaccharide binding sites are well conserved. The only exception seems to be the loop from Thr97 to Glu102 in concanavalin A Z corresponding to Thr216≠Glu224 in Erythrina and Thr28a≠Ala33a in the lectins from Lathyrus, lentil and pea.. Clear steric clashes with these loops are observed if a monosaccharide that is normally not recognised is placed into the binding site Z Fig. 11.. Since these loops mainly hydrogen bond to the bound carbohydrate with their backbone NH and CO groups, one may assume that the main determinant for choosing between mannose or galactose specificity is the length and conformation of this loop, but not directly by the individual amino acid side chains Zin the case of E. corralodentron lectin, hydrogen bonds between side chains of this loop and lactose are observed, but proven to be dispensable by site directed mutagenesis ≠ see below.. We will therefore call this loop the ``monosaccharide specificity loop'', as we will show in the following sections that it also plays a similar role in determining fucose, chitobiose and complex specificity. Essentially identical conclusions were also drawn in a recent comparative modelling study w124x. These authors found that the length of the monosaccharide specificity loop Ztermed `loop D' in Ref. w124x. is invariant in the GlcrMan specificity group and that there is a correlation between the length of this loop and monosaccharide specificity. This idea is further corroborated by recent mutagenesis studies on the E. corallodendron lectin w125x, the GlcNAc specific lectin II from Griffonia simplicifolia Z GS-II. w126x, a bark lectin from Robinia pseu-

This transformation was then applied to the galactose residue present in the co-ordinate set from Erythrina corallodendron.

doacacia w127x and pea lectin w154x. In these studies, muting the conserved Asp and Asn invariantly results in a complete loss of carbohydrate binding activity. Also, in the E. corallodendron lectin, the activity of mutants involving Phe131 Z which stacks upon the galactose ring in the monosaccharide binding site. depended upon the nature of the replacement residue: replacement with the isosteric and hydrophobic Tyr is allowed, but the smaller Val and Ala lead to an inactive protein w125x. Similar results were also found for substitutions of Tyr124 in GS-II w126x. Point mutations in the monosaccharide specificity loop on the other hand do not lead to inactivation in the case of E. corallodendron lectin w125≠127,154x, but deletion mutants in this loop resulted in inactivation of GS-II. The similarities between the ManrGlc and Gal specificity groups extend also towards oligosaccharide recognition. As described in the previous paragraphs, two sets of residues appear to form recurrent themes. The first set are those residues that form the so-called hydrophobic binding site, which is present in members of both specificity groups. This subsite is

not only responsible for the enhanced affinity for monosaccharides substituted with hydrophobic aglycons, but may also play a role in binding the Nacetylamine group of GalNAc and even in oligosaccharide specificity in the case of E. corallodendron, where they have been suggested to form a fucose subsite. The second set involves Tyr100 and Asp16 in concanavalin A and their equivalents in the other lectins. These residues may be the key determinants for oligosaccharide specificity in most ManrGlc and Gal specific lectins. In contrast to the monosaccharide binding site, however, the specific side chains of the residues involved are at least as important as loop lengths, although the latter certainly also plays a role. 4.3. Other specificities 4.3.1. Complex specificity Some legume lectins are not inhibited by any simple sugar. Therefore, this specificity group has been termed `complex'. The crystal structures of two members of the complex type of legume lectins are

known: that of lectin IV from Griffonia simplicifolia ZGS-IV. and that of PHA-L from Phaseolus ’ulgaris. Only in the case of GS-IV, a structure of a carbohydrate complex has been reported w17x. This structure reveals that the Lewis-b tetrasaccharide Z Fuca1≠ 2-Galb1≠3wFuca1≠4xGlcNAcb1-Me. binds to the lectin with its galactose in the monosaccharide binding site in a way essentially identical to what has been observed for the lectins from coral tree and soybean w15,16x. The main difference between GS-IV and the E. corallodendron lectin is again the monosaccharide specificity loop Z Val221≠Glu225 in GS-IV and Thr216≠Glu224 in E. corallodendron.. This loop hydrogen bonds to the galactose in the combining site of E. corallodendron lectin but in GS-IV hydrogen bonds with the a1≠4 linked fucose ZFig. 12.. In the latter lectin, the corresponding loop Zresidues Val221 to Glu225. has a rather unusual conformation, including a non-proline cis-peptide bond between Val221 and Gly222, which was identified as essential for the specificity of GS-IV. Legume lectins that can be inhibited by simple monosaccharides show only a low affinity for these saccharides Z K dis s 10y2 ≠10y3 M. Zfor some recently determined values of the thermodynamic parameters of the association between legume lectins and monosaccharides, see w128≠130x.. It is therefore

not a surprise that the removal of one or two hydrogen bonds abolishes monosaccharide binding. This is exactly what seems to have happened with GS-IV: the hydrogen bonds between the galactose in the monosaccharide binding site with the monosaccharide specificity loop have been removed and are compensated by protein≠carbohydrate hydrogen bonds with other residues from the tetrasaccharide. This structure therefore suggests that molecular recognition by the legume lectins with a so-called complex specificity is similar to that occurring in lectins with a defined monosaccharide specificity, but with some of the interactions that normally occur with the monosaccharide removed, so that this monosaccharide cannot bind anymore on its own. It is therefore likely that all lectins of complex specificity will be classifiable into one of the monosaccharide specificity groups when structural information becomes known. 4.3.2. Fucose specific lectins Several fucose specific legume lectins have been isolated, but only two have been analysed in detail as what concerns the mechanism of carbohydrate specificity: lectin I from gorse Z Ulex europaeus ≠ UEA-I. w131x and the lectin from Lotus tetragonolobus w132,133x. The former lectin has also been crys-

tallised w134x, but no structure has been published so far. Some evidence comes from binding studies with deoxy-derivatives of L-Fuc a 1≠2-D-Galb1≠4-DGlcNAc, the highest affinity ligand known to UEA-I w131x. From these studies, all three hydroxyls of the fucose were identified as involved in key polar interactions, although the effect of deleting the O2 hydroxyl is less dramatic w135x, suggesting that O3 and O4 might interact with the conserved Asp≠Asn≠Gly triad, as is the case for the Gal specific lectins. Recently, Gohier and co-workers modelled the binding of fucose by UEA-I w136x. This study resulted in several possible orientations for the fucose ring in the binding site, and it was not possible to decide which mode of binding was the most probable one. Therefore, a definite answer on how fucose specificity is achieved will have to await the determination of a crystal structure. 4.3.3. Chitobiose specific lectins Less information is available on the molecular basis of the specificity of the chitobiose Z or GlcNAc. specific legume lectins. Such lectins are found in the seeds of Ulex europaeus ZUEA-II., Laburnum alpinum and Cytisus species w137≠140x and in the seeds and leaves of Griffonia simplicifolia ZGS-II. w141x. UEA-II is the only one for which the saccharide specificity has been investigated in more detail w142x. It was found that UEA-II has its highest affinity for L-Fuc a1≠2-D-Galb1≠4-D-GlcNAcb1≠6-R, the same trisaccharide that is the best known inhibitor of UEA-I, which is fucose specific and shares less than 50% sequence identity with UEA-II. This similarity in oligosaccharide specificity is remarkable in view of their differences in monosaccharide specificity. UEA-I is not inhibited by chitobiose while L-fucose does not at all bind to UEA-II. UEA-II has now been crystallised Zour unpublished results. and comparison of this structure with the one of UEA-I will undoubtedly reveal how these two lectins recognise the same oligosaccharide using different epitopes. Chitobiose specific lectins also weakly interact with some glucosides such as cellobiose, indicating that the N-acetyl group is not essential w141,142x. One might therefore speculate that in the case of UEA-II, the monosaccharide binding site is occupied by a GlcNAc or glucose residue in a way similar to

the ManrGlc specific lectins, but that the monosaccharide-specificity loop Z residues Val223 to Phe229 in UEA-II. does not interact with this GlcNAc or glucose, but rather with one or more residues further on the carbohydrate chain, such as for the complex specificity type of legume lectins. It remains however questionable whether this is compatible with its high affinity for L-Fuca1≠2-D-Galb1≠4-D-GlcNAc and L-Fuca1≠2-D-Galb1≠4-D-Glc. The GlcrMan specific lectins involve O4 in two key hydrogen bonds, which seems incompatible with any bulky substituent on O4. It should also be noted here that in their original paper describing the fine specificity of UEAII, Pereira and co-workers showed that these two saccharides have a large area in common with chitobiose that is structurally identical and that is most likely the part of the carbohydrate with which the lectin interacts w142x. Some further evidence comes from a mutagenesis study on lectin II from Griffonia simplicifolia w126x, which also weakly binds GlcNAc. As expected from similar studies on pea lectin and PHA-L w125,140≠ 144x, substitution of the conserved Asp88 and Asn136 in the monosaccharide binding site abolishes carbohydrate binding. On the other hand, the effect of mutating Tyr134 depends upon the nature of the replacement residue: while the mutation Y134F seems to have no effect, Y134D and Y134G eliminates binding of GlcNAc. This can be rationalised when one considers that Tyr134 corresponds to Trp132 in the Dolichos biflorus seed lectin, one of the key residues suggested to interact with the N-acetyl moiety of GalNAc. Perhaps in the chitobiose or GlcNAc specific lectins, the same amino acids are responsible for interacting with the N-acetyl moiety of the GlcNAc that is bound in the monosaccharide binding site. Interestingly, this study also gives evidence for our hypothesis that monosaccharide specificity is determined largely by the length and conformation of the so-called monosaccharide specificity loop ZThr97≠Glu102 in concanavalin A, Thr28a≠Ala33a in the Vicieae lectins and Thr216≠Glu224 in the E. corallodendron lectin.: Point mutations in the corresponding loop of GS-II Z Ser225≠Ser230. such as L226K and Q227E had no effect on GlcNAc binding, while the deletion of the dipeptide Leu226≠Gln227 destroyed GlcNAc binding. In other words, again loop length Zand probably conformation. is a more

important determinant than the exact amino acid sequence.

5. Conclusion Despite the slow start in the seventies and eighties, structural knowledge on legume lectins has boomed in the last five years. Although originally considered a diverse group of proteins, the initial structures of concanavalin A and some Vicieae lectins suggested that all of them would have a highly conserved tertiary and quaternary structure. The variation in the quaternary associations now known came as a real surprise. The work by the group of Brewer further suggests that this variation in quaternary structure may be the basis of a form of oligosaccharide specificity previously unrecognised in lectins. The molecular origin of subunit associations in legume lectins, however, is far from clear. Steric hindrance due to bulky covalently attached carbohydrate was initially proposed in the case of GS-IV and the lectin from E. corallodendron, but has been revised in the case of GS-IV. Furthermore, PHA-L forms the canonical dimer and is glycosylated at the same positions as the E. corallodendron lectin. The lectin from peanut is not glycosylated but nevertheless forms the most remarkable of all tetramers. It is likely that the many legume lectin crystal structures that will be solved in the next years will add to the variety of quaternary structures already available and it is hoped that a synthesis of the available structural information will then lead to a satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon. A great deal has been learned about the molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition. The principles derived from the early structures have been confirmed numerous times and we have seen glimpses on how different mono- and oligosaccharides can be selected by a conserved scaffold. It appears that a basic set of essential and conserved residues is surrounded by a limited number of variable residues that direct the specificity of the lectin, thus opening interesting perspectives for engineering novel specificities into a legume lectin. Interesting parallels can be drawn between the different lectins, not only for the architecture of the monosaccharide binding sites, but also for oligosaccharide recognition. A further understand-

ing will undoubtedly require a combination of crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, NMR and modelling. The continuing interest in these proteins nevertheless suggests that further advances may be made in the near future. Acknowledgements We wish to thank F. Brewer, A. Imberty, F Casset, ∞ M.

A crystal structure has also become available of the dimeric stem and leaf lectin ZDB58. of Dolichos biflorus. This lectin is unusual as it is dimeric but still shows adenine binding activity. In the crystal structure of DB58, a novel type of dimer is observed, in which the adenine binding site of the seed lectin is structurally conserved.
