The structures of Micrococcus lysodeikticus catalase, its ferryl intermediate (compound II) and NADPH complex
The crystal structure of the bacterial catalase from Micrococcus lysodeikticus has been re®ned using the gene-derived Ê sequence both at 0.88 A resolution using data recorded at Ê resolution with room-temperature data. 110 K and at 1.5 A The atomic resolution structure has been re®ned with individual anisotropic atomic thermal parameters. This has revealed the geometry of the haem and surrounding protein, including many of the H atoms, with unprecedented accuracy and has characterized functionally important hydrogen-bond interactions in the active site. The positions of the H atoms are consistent with the enzymatic mechanism previously suggested for beef liver catalase. The structure reveals that a Ê 25 A long channel leading to the haem is ®lled by partially occupied water molecules, suggesting an inherent facile access to the active site. In addition, the structures of the ferryl intermediate of the catalase, the so-called compound II, at Ê 1.96 A resolution and the catalase complex with NADPH at Ê 1.83 A resolution have been determined. Comparison of compound II and the resting state of the enzyme shows that Ê the binding of the O atom to the iron (bond length 1.87 A) is associated with increased haem bending and is accompanied by a distal movement of the iron and the side chain of the proximal tyrosine. Finally, the structure of the NADPH complex shows that the cofactor is bound to the molecule in an equivalent position to that found in beef liver catalase, but that only the adenine part of NADPH is visible in the present structure.

1. Introduction
Catalase (hydrogen peroxide:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase; EC 1.11.1.6) is a redox enzyme present in all aerobic organisms (Deisseroth & Dounce, 1970). The enzyme's role is believed to be the protection of the cell from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide by decomposing it into water and molecular oxygen before highly reactive hydroxyl radicals are formed. Catalase de®ciency is known to cause the inherited disease acatalasemia (Ogata, 1991). Catalases have been shown to be involved in alcohol oxidation (Bradford et al., 1993) and play a protective role in in¯ammation (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 1984), in the prevention of mutations (Vuillaume, 1987) and in ageing and certain cancers (Mallery et al., 1995). Catalase has been a subject of interest from the beginning of the last century and a number of recent reviews dealing with its biochemistry and structure are available (Bravo et al., 1997; Zamocky & Koller, 1999; Nicholls et al., 2001; Mate et al., 2001). Three groups of catalases have been identi®ed. The ®rst, most fully characterized, group contains the mono-functional

`classic' haem-containing catalases, which are homotetramers with one haem per subunit and are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The subunit sizes within this group vary, consisting of about 500 residues (small-subunit catalases) or 700 residues (large-subunit catalases). The second group is composed of the non-haem Mn-catalases, homohexameric enzymes with two manganese ions in the active site, that have so far been found only in prokaryotes (Antonyuk et al., 2000; Barynin et al., 2001). The third group, haem-containing catalase±peroxidases with dual catalytic activity, are apparently gene-duplicated members of the plant peroxidase superfamily (Welinder, 1991). The haem-catalases are not only exceptional mediators of hydrogen peroxide decomposition but are also effective catalysts of peroxide-dependent oxidation of hydrazoic, formic and nitrous acids, of lower aliphatic alcohols and of hydroxylamine (Schonbaum & Chance, 1976). The reactions occur in at least two steps: 1986), P. vitale (PVC; Vainshtein et al., 1986; Murshudov et al., 1996), M. lysodeikticus (MLC; Murshudov et al., 1992), E. coli (HPII; Bravo et al., 1995), Proteus mirabilus (PMC; Gouet et al., 1995), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SCC-A; Mate et al., 1999) and human erythrocyte (HEC; Putnam et al., 2000). Ê The structure of MLC was reported previously at 1.5 A resolution with the X-ray amino-acid sequence derived from the electron-density map (Murshudov et al., 1992). Here, we present the revised amino-acid sequence of MLC deduced from the cloned gene, together with four crystal structures: the Ê room-temperature structure at 1.5 A resolution (MLC-RT), Ê the atomic resolution cryogenic structure at 0.88 A (MLCÊ 0.88), the cryogenic structure of MLC compound II at 1.96 A (MLC±PAA), and the room-temperature structure of MLC Ê complexed with NADPH at 1.8 A (MLC±NADPH).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. DNA cloning and sequencing

Where E is the enzyme, porph is protoporphyrin IX, R is H, alkyl or acetyl and X is O, C O or (CH2)n. When R is H and X is O, ROOH and HXOH become the best known substrate of catalase: H2O2. The ®rst step of the reaction is a two-electron oxidation of the resting ferric state of the enzyme with an FeIII-porphyrin group to compound I, which contains an FeIV-oxo porphyrin with a %-cationic radical (Dolphin et al., 1971; Roberts et al., 1981). The second step is a two-electron reduction of compound I back to the resting state directly or via an alternative pathway through compound II, produced by a singleelectron reduction of compound I. Compound II may then return to the ferric state using a one-electron donor or may be converted to inactive compound III by a further two-electron oxidation by H2O2. Some catalases are more resistant to H2O2-induced inactivation via formation of compound II and compound III than others (DeLuca et al., 1995; Lardinois et al., 1996). For example, catalases from Penicillium vitale (PVC), Escherichia coli (hydrogenperoxidase II; HPII) and the largesubunit catalases do not form compound II at all. Most of those that are able to form compound II are small-subunit catalases that apparently bind NADPH. This prevents compound II formation via one- or two-electron transfer from NADPH to the haem (Almarsson et al., 1993; Kirkman et al., 1999; Hillar et al., 1994; Olson & Bruice, 1995). M. lysodeikticus catalase (MLC) is one of the `classic' haemcontaining catalases. At present, the crystal structures of seven catalases of this group are known from different species and at different resolutions: those from beef liver (BLC; Fita et al.,

For direct cloning and expression, the degenerate oligonucleotides 5H -d(TTTTCCATGGAGCACCAGAAGACSACSCCSCAC)-3H and 5H -d(TTTTGAATTCACATSCGSGCCTCSCCSCCSGCCTC)-3H (where S = C or G) were synthesized (0.2 mM scale) using an ABi392 machine. These were designed to match the N-terminal chemically derived sequence (TEHQKTTPHA) starting at Glu2 and the X-ray derived C-terminal sequence, respectively, although it should be noted that the re®ned native MLC structure reveals an Ile residue at the C-terminus, not Met as previously reported. PCR was performed in 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.3 buffer using 10% glycerol co-solvent and ®nal concentrations of 200 mM dNTP, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM degenerate primer. 25 cycles of 369 K for 90 s and 345 K for 150 s were performed using 200 ng of M. luteus ATCC4698 chromosomal DNA as template and 2.5 U Taq polymerase, yielding a single product of 1.5 kbp ¯anked by NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites (bold) for cloning into pET21d (Novagen) of the T7 expression system of Studier (1991). Single-stranded DNA derivatives of the recombinant pET clones were prepared by transfection with helper phage R408 (Promega) to obtain the transcribed strand or by capture of biotinylated PCR products on magnetic beads (Dynal) for the coding strand. DNA was sequenced using a battery of oligonucleotides which prime at regular intervals, extended in the presence of labelled dCTP to enhance signal strength by T7 polymerase with deazaG/A mixes (Pharmacia) and at elevated temperature (338 K) using a thermostable enzyme (Iso-therm, Epicenter Technologies) to relieve compressions. The sequence was con®rmed on one strand using dye-terminators and thermal cycling incorporating dITP on an automated sequencer (ABi 373). A number of CT transversion mutations were evident, consistent with the known mutational tendency of Taq polymerase, and to which the extended denaturation phase during the PCR may have been a contributing factor. A composite DNA sequence based on independent isolates has been deposited at the EMBL under accession code AJ438208.

mented in the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) available from CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). In the later stages, all waters were checked using the X-®t option of QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.) and new water molecules were added using the X-solvate option (Old®eld, 1996). In the ®nal stages, H atoms were added at their riding positions. All measured re¯ections except those chosen for Rfree and ' A calculation were used. For all four structures, overall anisotropic scale factors were re®ned and applied to Fc. Where multiple conformations were suggested by the difference map, the B values of the relevant atoms were checked to see if they provided consistent information. If so, a second, alternative, conformation was introduced. 2.4.1. MLC-RT. The initial re®nement of MLC-RT using PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980) gave an R value of 15.0% (Murshudov et al., 1992). In the ®rst stages, waters were added using the program WATPEAK (Vagin et al., 1998) and ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993). For further re®nement, 5% of È the data were chosen for free R value (Brunger, 1993) validation. The model was rebuilt using the amino-acid sequence deduced from the gene. Up to this stage, all re¯ections in the Ê resolution range 8±1.5 A except those chosen for free R-value calculation were used for re®nement and for map calculation. At this point, maximum-likelihood re®nement implemented in REFMAC became available and all subsequent re®nement was carried out using this program and using all measured re¯ections. The resulting MLC-RT model was used as a starting point for re®nement of the other three structures. 2.4.2. MLC-0.88. After ten cycles of isotropic re®nement, R/Rfree reached 16.5/17.2%. Further re®nement was carried out using individual anisotropic atomic re®nement in REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1999). After every ten cycles of re®nement, all protein atoms were checked to look for alternative conformations. All water atoms were inspected using Fo À Fc maps. If there was negative density at the position of a water atom then the 2Fo À Fc map was inspected to see if there was atom at this position. If there was clear density in the 2Fo À Fc map then its occupancy was reduced to 0.5. Two additional sulfate ions were located with partial occupancy. 2.4.3. MLC-PAA. After the ®rst cycles of re®nement against the cryogenic MLC±PAA data, the difference map showed clear density at the sixth coordination position of the iron and this was introduced to the model as an O atom. The relatively poor data and re®nement statistics compared with the native crystals (Table 1) are probably the result of deterioration of the crystal, perhaps a consequence of the long soaking time in the PAA solution. 2.4.4. MLC-NADPH. After the ®rst ten cycles of re®nement, Fo À Fc and 2Fo À Fc maps showed clear density for the adenine base, one ribose and two phosphates of the NADPH. The nucleotide was built into the density using QUANTA. 2.4.5. H atoms. In all four structures, the addition of H atoms in their riding positions reduced the R/Rfree (in MLCRT by 1.4/1%, in MLC±NADPH by 1.4/0.8% and in MLC± PAA by 0.8/0.2%). For MLC-0.88, H atoms were included from the start. The fall in Rfree is greater at high resolution, indicating that the protein atomic positions are accurate.

Unless otherwise stated all crystallographic calculations were carried out using programs from the CCP4 program suite. All re®ned models were checked with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Final statistics of the re®nement are given in Table 1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Gene cloning and primary structure

The PCR approach was used for the direct cloning of the catalase gene from chromosomal M. luteus DNA (this strain is synonymous with M. lysodeikticus). The method is an extension of protocols that utilize degenerate primers based on conserved amino-acid sequences in multiple alignments of coding regions to prime the PCR. In this case, the primers were designed to both amplify a complete gene, based on the chemically determined N-terminal sequence and the C-terminal residues visible in the three-dimensional structure (Murshudov et al., 1992), and to incorporate unique restriction sites for cloning (see x2). The degeneracy of the primers was minimal, as the choice of synonymous codons are biased towards those which maximize their G + C content, re¯ecting the low A + T content of the M. luteus genome ($30%). For example, of the six possible codons that specify leucine, 99% are CTG or CTC. Although it is unusual to know both the Nand C-terminal protein sequence for a gene-cloning target, advances in C-terminal protein sequencing suggests that such an approach will become more general. The recombinant catalase protein overexpressed in E. coli runs at the equivalent position to authentic M. lysodeikticus catalase on SDS±PAGE (data not shown), although the speci®c activity is lower than expected, presumably owing to the restricted availability of haem cofactor. The cloning of the catalase gene opens up the possibility of using site-directed mutagenesis of this protein for structure±function analysis. The revised MLC protein sequence as translated from the catalase gene is 84% identical to that derived from the previous X-ray model. The differences are minor (e.g. Val versus Thr) and are often at positions located on the surface of the molecule. However, some alterations to the X-ray-derived sequence proved crucial for correct model building owing to ambiguities caused by alternate conformations (e.g. residues Leu105 and Tyr378, see below).
3.2. Analysis of MLC structures 3.2.1. Overall fold. The overall structure of MLC has been described previously (Murshudov et al., 1992). It has a threedimensional organization that closely resembles that of BLC and other known catalases. The DNA-deduced amino-acid sequence of MLC shows that the previous numbers of residues assigned by X-ray analysis should be increased by four. MLC is a homotetramer with 222 molecular symmetry (Fig. 1a). Each monomer consists of 503 residues and one protoporphyrin IX group. Like BLC (Fita et al., 1986), MLC has four domains. The ®rst N-terminal domain (1±58) contains one -helix, which is completely surrounded by residues of

neighbouring subunits within the tetramer. The second domain (59±352) is an + domain which contains eight -helices and an eight-stranded -barrel. This domain and the fourth four-helical domain (425±503) are connected by the third domain (353±424) which wraps around the surface of the molecule and together with the ®rst domain is responsible for the organization of the tightly packed tetramer. A comparison of the MLC and BLC folds is shown in Fig. 1(b). Their three-dimensional similarity starts at residue 13 of MLC and residue 26 of BLC and ends at residues 487 and 499, respectively. The r.m.s. deviation between CA atoms Ê of the 463 equivalent residues is 1.1 A, as calculated using O (Jones et al., 1991) for residue pairs where the difference Ê between CA atoms was less than 3.8 A. 210 of these residues are identical in sequence. The biggest differences in the CA position, apart from the N-terminus, are in the wrapping Ê Ê domain, at the 401st (8 A) and at the 422nd (9 A) residues of MLC (Fig. 1b). 3.2.2. Resting state: MLC-RT and MLC-0.88. As the statistics suggest, the MLC-0.88 data (Table 1) are of very high quality. Most of the H atoms could be identi®ed directly in the Fo À Fc map at the 3' level. The most important of them from a mechanistic point of view ± those of the active site His61 and Asn133 À are discussed below. In spite of the high quality of the data and exhaustive re®nement, positive Fo À Fc electrondensity features remain around the molecule and in the channels associated with water molecules. As the conformational angles 9 and 2 were not restrained during re®nement, they can act as independent indicators of model quality. The conformational angles of 99.6% residues are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 2; Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965). The 9 and 2 angles of only two residues, Val22 and Ser202, are in the disallowed region. Both are the central residues of  turns. Val22 takes part in the intersubunit interaction and despite its hydrophobicity is unusually exposed: the accessibility surface Ê Ê area for CG1 is 11 A2 and for CG2 is 34 A2. The unusual conformation of Ser202 is a common feature in all known catalase structures and seems to be related to the folding of the barrel. Four other non-glycine residues have positive 9 and 2 angles. One of them, His61, is conserved in the other catalases and is essential for catalytic activity. The other three are situated either in the connecting segment (Met376 and Glu373) or in the C-terminal region (His487). Out of 26 prolines, two are in the cis conformation. One (Pro60) is situated before the active-site His61 and seems to be a special feature of MLC. Preceding the active-site histidine, most catalases contain the sequence Val-Val. In MLC these residues are Arg-Pro. Pro60 is probably in the cis conformation to avoid unfavourable interactions between the long hydrophilic side chain of Arg59 and the hydrophobic part of the haem. The second cis proline, Pro389, is a feature of most catalases (Gouet et al., 1995; Fita et al., 1986; Bravo et al., 1995) and is believed to play a role in the tetramer organization, as there are a number of intersubunit interactions around this residue. No electron density could be identi®ed for the ®rst ®ve N-terminal residues. There are negative difference electron densities around residues 6±11. At this resolution, B values in general do not compensate for inaccurate occupancies. It is clear that these residues have several conformations, of which only one has been successfully modelled. MLC-0.88 shows that going towards the N-terminus along the polypeptide chain, disorder starts from residue 11 and becomes most pronounced at residue 6. The rest of the structure is mostly Figure 1 well de®ned with low B values.

the MLC-RT structure (538). This partly re¯ects the high resolution and quality of the MLC-0.88 data and partly re¯ects the fact that local minima become more pronounced in vitri®ed crystals. Of special interest are waters in the active site and in the haem channel in MLC-0.88 (see below). In addition to one sulfate ion bound in MLC-RT, MLC-0.88 has two additional sulfate ions, each half occupied. For similar reasons, there are more residues with double conformations detected in MLC-0.88 (45) than in MLC-RT (12). Only eight are common to both structures. There are two regions with multiple conformations, which are of especial interest as they break down the exact 222 molecular and crystallographic symmetry and introduce minor heterogeneity into the homotetramer. The ®rst is the main chain of residues 105±106 (Fig. 3). The density clearly shows double conformations for these atoms and correlated double conformations for the side chain of Leu105. The two conformations involve a 180 ¯ip about the peptide bond. The two conformations are complementary in the two subunits. As seen in Fig. 3, the conformation with the carbonyl O atom pointing towards the opposing subunit cannot simultaneously coexist in the symmetry-related subunit without giving rise to serious steric con¯icts. These residues (105±106) are adjacent to Ser99, which is conserved in all catalases. Ser99 OG makes a strong Ê hydrogen bond (2.78 A) with the essential His61 and is presumably responsible for stabilizing its orientation. This feature (105±106) of double conformation is detected in most catalases re®ned with high-resolution data (e.g. PVC and HEC) and it is probable that it is of functional importance, particularly as the residues Val101 and Ala102 lie along the edge of the haem channel. The second residue that violates the quaternary 222 Figure 2 symmetry of the tetramer is Tyr378. There are again two Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) for the M. lysodeikticus catalase model. Glycine residues are indicated by complementary conformations of the side chain in adjacent triangles and all other residues by squares. Residues with positive 9 subunits, with the same conformation in each being in serious angles are highlighted. 88.5% of residues are in the most favoured regions steric con¯ict. Tyr378 is distant from the active site and is not and 11.1% are in allowed regions. Two residues, Val22 and Ser202, are in the disallowed region. conserved among catalases. It is a feature speci®c to MLC and almost certainly plays no signi®cant role in catalytic activity. 3.2.3. Compound II. The data for the Ê compound II complex extend to 1.96 A and its analysis is correspondingly less detailed. There are no major changes in the overall structure relative to the resting-state molecule and the r.m.s. deviation between CA atoms of MLC±PAA and MLC-0.88 is Ê 0.16 A, and those of MLC±PAA and MLCÊ RT is 0.15 A. The largest differences are in the N-terminal residues 6±7, which have high B values, and in the surface loops (residues 250±260 and 373±390), where there is some disorder. Five out of seven methionines have been oxidized to form Figure 3 methionine sulfoxide, but it is unlikely that Double conformations of residues Leu105 and Gly106 that violate both crystallographic and this plays any functional role.

The haem geometry is the same in the two structures, showing similar bending, and the Fe atom is displaced from the NA±NB±NC±ND plane towards the proximal side by a similar distance.

The adenine base of the NADPH lies parallel to Arg188, There are fewer water molecules detected in MLC±PAA which is conserved among all known NADPH-containing than in MLC-0.88, MLC-RT or MLC±NADPH, owing to the catalases, binding NADPH through its phosphate O atom relatively low resolution.

The nicotinamide moiety of NADPH in the MLC complex may have a position different from that in BLC, possibly related to the replacement of His304 involved in nicotinamide binding in BLC by Gln290 in MLC. His304 is conserved among other NADPHcontaining catalases and binds the nicotinamide base via a hydrogen bond to NO7. These differences may explain why the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH is not visible in the MLC complex.

along a line that bisects the propionic acids in both molecules. The distances from the haem iron to the nearest water or O atom (in compound II) are presented in Table 2. In MLC-RT the water molecule has a relatively high B value. In MLC-0.88, only when this Fe-linked water was assigned partial occupancy does its B value become comparable to that of surrounding protein atoms. The Fe is displaced from the plane of the Ê pyrrole N atoms by 0.14 A towards the Tyr343 phenolate O Ê atom. The close hydrogen bonds (2.7 A) to the phenolate O atom by Arg339 NE and NH2 favour the loss of a proton through electrostatic in¯uence and through steric effects. It is clear that the phenolate O atom is deprotonated both from the bond distance to the Fe and from the geometry of the oxygen's interactions with the N atoms of Arg339. There is an extensive hydrogen-bonding network extending from the phenolate O atom to Arg339, to His203 and to Asp333, and from here to the surface of the molecule. Inspection of the electron density shows the position of the H atoms in many of these interactions and con®rms the description of the networks made in earlier reports (Fita & Rossmann, 1985). The active site of the catalases is well characterized and is situated at the distal side of the haem. In MLC it includes the essential residues His61, Asn133 and Ser99. Unlike BLC (Fita et al., 1986), the haem in MLC is well de®ned and free of any damage. His61 donates a proton in its hydrogen bond to Ser99 OG (adjacent to the symmetry-violating double conformation of residues 105±106), which is responsible for maintaining the orientation of the histidine. The active-site Asn133, unlike His61, does not make any strong hydrogen bonds and it is not clear what contributes to the stabilization of its orientation. The closest contacts that Asn133 makes are Ê Ê to the waters W36 in the active site (3.20 A) and W50 (3.10 A) hydrogen bonded with Ser202 with an unusual (9, 2) conformation. Experimentally observed H atoms on His61 and on Asn133 ND2 (Fig. 5) clearly con®rm that the current orientations of these residues are correct. Fita & Rossmann (1985) based their reaction mechanism on this orientation of Ê these residues using 2.5 A resolution data where their orientation was less certain. Small positive density close to His61 NE2 suggests partial protonation of this residue (Fig. 5); this could have implications for the mechanism. Although it was shown by NMR (Lanir & Schejter, 1975) that the sixth coordination position of the iron could be occupied by a water molecule, experimental results using magnetic circular dichroism suggest that this position is empty (Andersson et al., 1995). In the MLC structure there is a Ê partially occupied water W289 at a distance of 2.31 A from the iron, occupying a near-ideal octahedral coordination position, although the bond is a little longer than expected (around Ê 2 A). No corresponding water molecule was reported in BLC (Fita et al., 1986) or PMC (Gouet et al., 1995), although there is a water molecule in PMC at a much larger distance from the Ê iron, about 2.8 A. However, the high-resolution structures of PVC (Murshudov et al., 1997) and HPII (Bravo et al., 1995) both contain a water at a corresponding position with an iron± Ê water distance of about 2.28 A. Inspection of the electron Ê density for the HEC structure at 1.5 A resolution shows a lowActa Cryst. (2002). D58, 1972±1982

Ê density water peak at about 2.3 A from the iron, suggesting a partially occupied water as in the MLC structures. The disagreement between crystallographic and magnetic circular dichroism data might be explained by the fact that this water is a very weak ligand of the iron, which stays in a high-spin state. Ê A second water, W36, with a B value of 9.1 A2, lies close by and makes a strong hydrogen bond with the iron's weakly Ê liganded water (the W36ÐW289 distance is 2.57 A) and with Ê the essential His61 (distance 2.67 A). There is a long and weak hydrogen bond between this water and ND2 of Asn133 at a Ê distance of 3.19 A. The high B value of W36 relative to neighbouring atoms (the average B value for this region is Ê 5 A2) and the partial occupancy of W289 might suggest that during the course of reaction they are easily displaced by substrate. The partially occupied iron-coordinating water and the double conformation of residues 105±106 may correlate with the observation that only half of the catalase is active at the same time (Chance & Oshino, 1971), although the structure of compound II shows that all Fe atoms are bound to O. iron by the O atom are restricted to the active site, the rest of the molecule being unaffected. Binding of oxygen to the iron in compound II is associated with small but distinct changes in the porphyrin conformation. The angles between the A, B and D pyrrole rings and pyrrole C change by between 3 and 5 (Table 3). There is a signi®cant change in the bridging pyrroles B and C. The aromatic rings Phe138 and Phe146 above the haem exhibit small movements associated with the ligand binding and the haem adjustments. The largest (more than Ê 0.25 A) movement is at Phe146, which appears to be associated with the movement of pyrrole B. The Phe138 ring has signi®cantly higher thermal parameters than its surrounding residues in the room-temperature and in the vitri®ed native structures. The movement of this ring in compound II is barely signi®cant. In compound II the second water (W36) molecule present in the active site of MLC is shifted just enough to avoid repulsive van der Waals contact with the iron-bound O atom Ê Ê at a distance of 3.48 A. The B value of this water (25 A2) is a Ê little higher than that of the surrounding atoms (about 20 A2). Unlike MLC-0.88, there is no other positive electron density in the active site that could be described as a partially occupied water. The highest positive electron density in the active site of compound II is around the CHC atom of haem, which shows an even higher bend of the haem at this position.

Ê In compound II the Fe atom moves 0.24 A toward the sixth Ê ligand. Tyr343 OH moves in concert by 0.28 A, accompanied by small changes of the dihedral angle at CA. The distance Ê between the sixth liganded O atom and the iron is 1.87 A (during re®nement this distance was not restrained and van der Waals repulsion for this particular pair of atoms was Ê removed from the restraint list) compared with the 2.2±2.3 A distance to the water in the resting state (Table 2). In the compound I and II PMC structures at low resolution (Gouet et Ê al., 1996) this distance was restrained to be 1.71 A. Inspection of the coordinates shows that in these structures there is distortion of the iron's octahedral coordination not found in MLC. The iron coordination seems to be near-ideal octahedral (Fig. 6). There is no signi®cant change in the iron±phenolic O distance in the two enzyme states. There is a movement of the iron relative to the pyrrole nitrogen plane.

Further away from the haem there appear to be few signi®cant changes in the structure, which can be correlated with the creation of an electron-transport pathway. 3.2.7. The haem channel. As in other catalases, the MLC active site is connected Ê with the surface of the molecule by a 25 A long narrow channel. There are subtle but probably important differences between the channel in MLC and the other catalases. Instead of the wide entrance funnel in BLC Ê (which becomes narrow at about 15 A from the haem iron) most of the MLC funnel is ®lled by the C-terminal residues, which form a narrow entrance (Fig. 7). This narrow entrance (the distance between atoms Ê forming it is about 6±7 A) is composed of the hydrophobic residues Ala164, Ala453 and two residues from close to the C-terminus, Ile492 and Val495. The narrow entrance of the channel may increase discrimination between substrates of various sizes, in a good agreement with the evidence that MLC is slower for larger substrates and faster for small substrates relative to other catalases (Jones & Middlemiss, 1972). The second narrow region of the channel is common to all known catalase structures. Ê It is situated about 7 A from the haem iron. This neck is probably responsible for discrimination and orientation of the substrate while it is entering the active site.

Ê 8.5 A. Just above the neck lie Gln153 and Gln167, each of which display two conformations (rotated by 180 around 13). Difference maps calculated after the re®nement of one of the two conformations show positive and negative densities at the positions occupied by the OE1 and NE2 atoms in MLC-0.88. At lower resolution the MLC-RT comparison of B values of these atoms after re®nement also clearly supports the possibility of two conformations. The B value of N becomes less and O becomes more than that of surrounding atoms. A comparison of B values of these atoms in compound II shows that this tendency remains unchanged. While this disordered behaviour may serve to accelerate diffusion in the haem channel of MLC, the equivalent residues to Gln153 and Gln167 are not conserved among catalases. Comparison of B values with surrounding atoms suggests that only two water molecules at the extreme ends of the haem channel are nearly fully occupied, W36 in the active site and W292 in the channel near to the molecular surface. Unsurprisingly, they are conserved in all MLC structures (Fig. 7). W292 is situated at the beginning of the channel near to the surface of the molecule and makes strong hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl O atom of Arg495 and the amide of Pro497, which would help stabilization of the C-terminus and channel structure. After inclusion of these waters in the structure-factor calculations, the difference map exhibits positive density showing that, in spite of the high resolution, not all the contents of the channel can be taken to describe discrete atoms. Partially occupied waters and positive electron density may indicate a dynamic structure for this haem-linked water system. We believe that the positions of partially occupied water molecules in the active-site channel represent the path of substrate and product into and out of the active site. Indeed, there is experimental evidence (Melik-Adamyan et al., 2001) showing that single-site mutation of the residue corresponding to MLC's His61 to Ala or Asn in HPII inactivates the enzyme and simultaneously increases the order of the water molecules in the active-site channel.

Inherent mobility in this channel is likely to be crucial for the enzyme to achieve the rapid reaction rates for which it is renowned.
