Structures of Ligand-free and Inhibitor Complexes of Dihydroorotase from Escherichia coli: Implications for Loop Movement in Inhibitor Design

School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, University of Sydney, New South Wales, 2006, Australia Dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyzes the reversible cyclization of N-carbamylL-aspartate (CA-asp) to L-dihydroorotate (DHO) in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. DHOase is a potential anti-malarial drug target as malarial parasites can only synthesize pyrimidines via the de novo pathway and do not possess a salvage pathway. Here we report the structures of Escherichia coli DHOase crystallized without ligand (1.7 Å resolution) and in the presence of the inhibitors 2-oxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4,6dicarboxylate (HDDP; 2.0 Å) and 5-fluoroorotate (FOA, 2.2 Å). These are the first crystal structures of DHOase-inhibitor complexes, providing structural information on the mode of inhibitor binding. HDDP possesses features of both the substrate and product, and ligates the Zn atoms in the active site. In addition, HDDP forms hydrogen bonds to the flexible loop (residues 105­115) stabilizing the "loop-in" conformation of the flexible loop normally associated with the presence of CA-asp in the active site. By contrast, FOA, a product-like inhibitor, binds to the active site in a similar fashion to DHO but does not ligate the Zn atoms directly nor stabilize the loop-in conformation. These structures define the necessary features for the future design of improved inhibitors of DHOase.

annum in tropical and sub-tropical areas.1 The disease is caused by four Plasmodium species, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. falciparum, transmitted to humans through a bite of the Anopheles mosquito. Malarial parasites possess the six enzymes required for de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides but are unable to salvage preformed pyrimidines for nucleic acid biosynthesis.2­4 In mammals, pyrimidine nucleotides can be synthesized via both the de novo and salvage pathways. Because of this major difference between pyrimidine synthesis in malarial parasites and in humans, understanding the architecture of the active sites and the catalytic mechanism of the enzymes involved in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis may lead to the development of potent inhibitors for anti-malarial chemotherapy.5 Dihydroorotase (DHOase; E.C. 3.5.2.3) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible cycliza-

813 based on its size and the sequence similarity. DHOases from different species, therefore, constitute a highly polymorphic family of enzymes. This variability between the enzymes can potentially be exploited in the design of species-specific inhibitors of DHOases. The protein for which a structure was deposited as a DHOase from A. tumefaciens (2OGJ) is also annotated as a hypothetical protein. This protein shares certain structural similarities with E. coli and P. gingivalis DHOases: the overall structure (TIM-barrel fold) and the presence of two Zn atoms bridged by a carboxylated lysine in the active site. However, it lacks the signature substrate-binding Arg residue the side chain of which interacts with the carboxylate group of DHO (R20, R65, and R67 in DHOases from E. coli, A. aeolicus and P. gingivalis, respectively) and the architecture of the active site cavity is significantly different from those of E. coli and P. gingivalis DHOases. The structural analysis and the biochemical data of this hypothetical protein are yet to be reported. The first reported structure for a DHOase was for the enzyme isolated from E. coli, and crystallized in the presence of the racemic substrate, D,L-CA-asp.15 Surprisingly, the substrate CA-asp was found at the active site of one subunit (B) and the product DHO at the active site of the other (A). There was no apparent asymmetry between the two subunits of the dimer that explained this observation.15 Subsequently, we reported the structure of E. coli DHOase crystallized in the presence of the optically pure product, L-DHO, refined at 1.9 Å resolution (PDB code 1XGE).16 Despite crystallizing the enzyme in the presence of product (DHO) rather than substrate (CA-asp), the structure was virtually identical to that reported earlier by Thoden et al., with CA-asp bound to the active site of subunit B and DHO bound to the active site of subunit A. Importantly, we were able to resolve the conformations of residues 109­112 for both subunits (not seen in the original structure analysis), showing that this tetrapeptide comprises part of a loop (residues 105­115) that has different conformations in each subunit. In subunit B, this loop reaches in toward the active site, with two residues at the tip of the loop (Thr109 and Thr110) forming hydrogen bonds with the bound substrate, CA-asp ("loop-in"). The corresponding residues in subunit A do not interact with the bound product, DHO, and instead form part of the protein

tion of N-carbamyl-L-aspartate (CA-asp) to L-dihydroorotate (DHO) in the third step of the pathway for de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides (Scheme 1). In higher eukaryotes, the activity of DHOase is found in a trifunctional enzyme CAD that catalyzes the first three steps of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway containing the activities of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) and DHOase.6 In bacteria and yeast, DHOase is monofunctional and usually homodimeric with a few monomeric exceptions.4,7,8 Phylogenetic analysis classifies the known DHOase sequences into two major families.9 The Type I DHOases are found in higher organisms and are larger (45 kDa) than the Type II enzymes found in many bacteria and fungi (38 kDa). Members of the same type of DHOases share more than 40% identity in amino acid sequences, while less than 20% sequence identity is found for members between the two types. Type I DHOases can be divided further into three subgroups: Type IA is monofunctional and independent (e.g. DHOase from Bacillus caldolyticus) 10,11 ; Type IB is fully functional only when one or more other enzymes in the pyrimidine pathway are associated noncovalently (e.g. DHOase from Aquifex aeolicus)7,12; while Type IC is covalently linked with at least one other enzyme in the pathway, exemplified by mammalian CAD. As members of the metal-dependent amidohydrolase superfamily that comprise a variety of hydrolytic enzymes of the (/)8-barrel (or TIM-barrel) fold,13,14 DHOases from different sources have different metal dependencies. In particular, the structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme (PDB codes 1J79 15 and 1XGE16), a Type II DHOase, has a binuclear Zncontaining active site, while in each of the two different crystal forms of the A. aeolicus enzyme (PDB codes 1XRT/1XRF12), a Type IB DHOase, the active sites contain a single Zn atom.12 Recently, two new structures of DHOases from Porphyromonas gingivalis (2GWN) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (2OGJ) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) by two independent structural genomics groups. Interestingly, the structure of P. gingivalis DHOase shows two Zn atoms, bridged by a carboxylated lysine in the active site although the enzyme probably belongs to the Type I DHOase family

814 surface ("loop-out"). In the subsequent structural analysis of a mutant enzyme with a reduced activity (T109S), we observed a transition from one crystal form (tetragonal) to the other (orthorhombic) when the mutant enzyme was crystallized in the presence of DHO, providing further evidence that the loop movement is connected to the enzyme catalysis.17 The structure of the unstable tetragonal crystal was stabilized by replacing DHO with a product-like inhibitor, 5-fluoorotate (FOA; Scheme 2, (1)) in the crystallization. In this structure the flexible loops are both in the loop-out conformation, consistent with FOA, like DHO, binding at both sites. The transition of the T109S mutant crystals from one crystal form to the other, in the presence of DHO was explained by initial binding of DHO to both subunits followed by slow conversion to CA-asp with consequent movement of the flexible loop and dissolution of the crystals. The wild-type-like orthorhombic crystals are then able to grow in the presence of DHO and CA-asp with one loop out and the other in. Although the structure of DHOase T109S complexed with FOA showed unambiguous density of FOA in the active site, severe anisotropy of the diffraction and the resulting low resolution did not permit a detailed analysis of FOA binding to the enzyme. The DHOase from hamster, a member of the Type I class of DHOases, has been extensively studied and characterized. 18,19 A number of potential inhibitors, designed as transition-state or substrate analogues, have been synthesized and assayed against the hamster DHOase because of the potential of these compounds as anti-malarial or anticancer agents (Scheme 2).20­22 2-Oxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (HDDP; Scheme 2, (2)), synthesized as a transition-state analogue, is a relatively potent competitive inhibitor of hamster DHOase, binding approximately 30 times more strongly to the active site than DHO (Ki = 0.74 M).20 FOA (Scheme 2, (1)) is a potent inhibitor of DHOase from the malaria parasite P. falciparum, causing 50% inhibition of growth of the parasites at concentrations of 6­42 nM in vitro.23­25 Mice infected with the rodent malarial parasites P. berghei and P. yoelli have been successfully rid of parasites with FOA.24,26,27 The inhibition by FOA was measured on the ring cleavage reaction

(DHO to CA-asp) of the purified DHOases from P. berghei and hamster giving Ki values of 65 and 15 M, respectively.20,24 Here, we report the structures of E. coli DHOase crystallized without ligand and in the presence of the inhibitors HDDP and FOA. These are the first crystal structures of DHOase-inhibitor complexes. The structures reveal the binding mode of each inhibitor to the active site of E. coli DHOase. Importantly, the structures also show different conformations of the flexible loop (residues 105­ 115) depending on the chemical structure of the entity bound at the active site, providing important information for designing more potent inhibitors. We also discuss the possible relevance of this information to the DHOase from P. falciparum in the design of novel compounds or improving existing inhibitors as potential anti-malarial drugs. Overall structure The overall structures of E. coli DHOase crystallized without ligand and in the presence of the inhibitors HDDP and FOA resemble the previously determined structures of E. coli DHOase. The refinement statistics for each structure are summarized in Table 1. The enzyme is a homodimer with one active site per subunit. Each monomer has a TIM-barrel structure with eight parallel -sheets connected by eight -helices. The active site of DHOase containing two zinc atoms resides in a cavity formed by the loops that connect the C-terminal end of each -sheet with the N-terminal end of the next -helix. Close-up views of the divalent metal sites from each structure are shown in Figure 1.

The asymmetric unit contains a single homodimer. Overall the model includes 680 amino acid residues (residues 4­346 in subunit A and residues 4­107 and 114­346 in subunit B), four zinc atoms, and 608 water molecules. The model has good geometry

Expression and purification procedures for E. coli DHOase were adapted from the previous report.35 Crystals of DHOase-inhibitor complexes were grown by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using a modification of the previously reported crystallization conditions.16 A drop containing 2 l of protein solution (8.8 mg ml-1) was mixed with 2 l of reservoir solution (15­20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0­6.5), 75 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl) and 0.45 l of 100 mM HDDP. In the case of the DHOaseFOA complex, 10 mM FOA stock was used due to the low solubility of FOA. Crystals without ligands were grown by the same technique using the reservoir solution containing 20­25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 M Na Hepes (pH 7) and 0.2 M NaF. Crystals were cryoprotected, prior to data collection, by immersion in the mother liquor solution containing 18% (v/v) glycerol. In-house data were recorded on a Mar345 image-plate detector with Cu-K X-rays from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator focussed using Osmic mirror optics. The diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL suite of programs, DENZO and SCALEPACK.36 Synchrotron data were recorded on beamline 14-BM-C at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory using an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector. The diffraction data were processed and scaled with HKL-2000.36 Crystals were isomorphous with the previously reported structure of E. coli DHOase (PDB code 1XGE),16 which was used as the initial model. Prior to refinement, the Zn atoms, CA-asp and DHO molecules, and solvent molecules were removed from the model. Residues B108­114 were also deleted to avoid model bias in the phase calculation. The refinement was carried out using REFMAC5 with TLS refinement,37,38 which included positional and temperature factor refinement with manual model building using the programs O39 and COOT.40 The positions of the two Zn atoms at each active site were identified in the early stage of refinement from the calculated difference Fourier electron-density maps and were included in the model. The addition of solvent molecules was carried out using the automated procedures implemented in ARP/wARP41 and inspected manually using the programs O and COOT. Positive electron density in difference Fourier maps within the active site cavity of each subunit was modelled with the ligands HDDP or FOA, the coordinates and refinement restraints for which were created using the Dundee PRODRG server.42 Finally, residues B108­114 were built into residual positive difference electron density adjacent to the active site of subunit B of the HDDP-complex structure.

with 96.4% of residues in favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1).28 In contrast to the structure of E. coli DHOase reported earlier by us (crystallized with L-DHO),16 but in agreement with that reported by Thoden et al. (crystallized with D,L-CA-asp),15 parts of the flexible loop (residues 105­115) of subunit B are disordered in the ligand-free structure. Specifically, there is no interpretable electron density for residues B108­ B113, which have therefore been omitted from the model. The presence of a moiety at the active site, capable of hydrogen-bonding to Thr109 and Thr110, at the tip of the flexible loop (residues 105­115) is therefore required to stabilize the loop-in conformation. In subunit A, this loop faces away from the active site and the loop-out conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with a neighbouring symmetry-related molecule (­x + 1, y + 1/2, ­z + ½) as observed previously in the structure crystallized in the presence of L-DHO. The crystal packing

effectively selects one out of the many combinations of loop conformations that are possible for the dimers in solution. The packing of molecules in this crystal form preferentially stabilizes a loop-out conformation for subunit A. The loop-out conformation for subunit B, however, is precluded by unfavourable steric clashes with neighbouring symmetryrelated molecules. The two Zn atoms in the ligand-free structure are bridged by a water molecule or hydroxide ion (Figure 1). The distances between the two Zn atoms are 3.4 and 3.5 Å for subunits A and B, respectively. When relative positional errors are taken into account, these distances are not significantly different from that in the DHO-bound active sites (3.6 Å) from our previous structure, where Zn atoms are similarly bridged by a solvent molecule (Supplementary Data Table 1, estimated standard uncertainties (ESU) of the structures are 0.10 Å for the structure of DHOase crystallized with L-DHO and

0.07 Å for the ligand-free structure, respectively). On the other hand, these distances are significantly shorter than the Zn­Zn separation in the CA-aspbound active site (3.9 Å), where the CA-asp molecule provides a bidentate bridge through one of its carboxylate groups (atoms C4, O4 and O5). No gross rearrangement of side-chains in proximity to the ligand-binding pocket was observed in the ligand-free structure. In the structure of DHOase crystallized with DHO (PDB code 1XGE), the

product molecule (DHO) is held in place by four side-chain atoms (Arg20 N1 and N2, Asn44 N2 and His254 N 2 ) and three main-chain atoms (Leu222 N and O, and Ala266 O) of subunit A. The substrate (CA-asp)-bound subunit coordinates the substrate molecule using the common atoms (Arg20 N1 and N2, Asn44 N2, Leu222 N and O, and Ala266 O) in addition of Thr109 O1 and Thr110 O1 atoms from the flexible loop. In the ligand-free structure, several ordered water molecules are

819 monomer. Each active site contains two zinc atoms and one HDDP molecule. Despite the fact that the mixture of R and S stereoisomers at the C6 position of HDDP was used for co-crystallization, the electron density for HDDP in each active site is unambiguous for the R conformation (Figures 1 and 2). The residues of the flexible loop (residues 105­115) are ordered for both subunits. Surprisingly, the loop has a different conformation in each subunit, despite the fact that HDDP is found in each active site. In the case of subunit A, the flexible loop (residues 105­115) faces away from the active site and forms hydrogen bonds (AsnA111 N2  GlnB*289 O (3.3 Å), SerA112 N  GluB*292 O1 (2.8 Å) and SerA112 O  GluB*292 O2 (2.6 Å)) with a neighbouring symmetry-related molecule (­x + 1, y + 1/2, ­z + 1/2). In the case of subunit B, the loop faces inwards toward the active site, and residues Thr109 and Thr110 make hydrogen bonds with the bound HDDP molecule (Figure 2(b)). This asymmetry of the loop conformation is almost identical with that observed in our previous structure of DHOase crystallized in the presence of L-DHO. HDDP, designed as a "transition-state analogue", has two carboxylate groups. One is joined at the C4

found in the active site, forming hydrogen bonds with these ligand-binding residues (Arg20, Asn44, His254, Ala266 and Leu222). When subunits A and B of the ligand-free DHOase are superposed on the identical subunits of DHOase crystallized in the presence of DHO, the root mean squared deviations (rmsd) in the positions of 343 common C atoms in subunit A and 337 common C atoms in subunit B are 0.14 and 0.19 Å, respectively, comparable to the respective estimated standard uncertainties of the structures. Therefore, no significant differences were observed in the ligand-free structure compared to the structure of DHOase crystallized in the presence of DHO, with the exception of the missing residues B108­B113 of the flexible loop in the ligand-free structure. The complex of E. coli DHOase with HDDP The structure of E. coli DHOase co-crystallised with HDDP was refined to 2.0 Å resolution with residuals R = 0.180 and Rfree = 0.235. The final model for the DHOase-HDDP complex has a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Residues 4­346 are modelled for each

820 position coplanar with the ring due to the presence of an adjacent double bond (C4­C5). The other is joined at the C6 position (Scheme 2, (2)). It had been proposed previously by Hambley et al.29 that the coplanar carboxylate group (C41, O41 and O42) would bind the Zn and the other carboxylate group (C61, O61 and O62) would form hydrogen bonds to other atoms of the enzyme. Our structure analysis shows that the opposite is in fact true (Figure 1). Specifically, in subunit A, the coplanar carboxylate group interacts with the guanidinium group of Arg20 (HDDP O41  Arg20 N2 (3.0 Å) and HDDP O42  Arg20 N1 (2.8 Å)) and the side-chains of Asn44 and His254 (HDDP O41  His254 N2 (3.0 Å) and HDDP O42  Asn44 N2 (2.9 Å)) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Data Table 2). The protein backbone atoms in closest contact with HDDP include the O and N-peptide atoms of Leu222, the O-peptide atom of Ala266, and the N-peptide atom of Gly267 (HDDP N1  Leu222 O (3.0 Å), HDDP O2  Leu222 N (2.8 Å) and Gly267 N (2.9 Å), and HDDP N3  Ala266 O (2.8 Å)). The atom O62 of the carboxylate group (C61, O61 and O62) of HDDP provides a monodentate bridge to the Zn atoms at the binuclear centre. The Zn atoms are 3.5 Å apart. This is similar to the situation in the structure of the product (DHO)-bound subunit where a water molecule (or hydroxide ion) bridges the two Zn atoms, but differs from the CA-asp-bound structure, where one of the carboxylate groups (C4, O4 and O5) bridges the Zn atoms in a bidentate manner. In this case the two Zn atoms are further, 3.9 Å, apart (Supplementary Data Table 1). The interactions made by HDDP in subunit B are similar to those observed in subunit A with the important difference being the presence of hydrogen bonds from Thr109 and Thr110 of the flexible loop to the HDDP ligand. Again, the coplanar carboxylate group (C41, O41 and O42) of HDDP provides strong interactions with side-chains surrounding the ligand-binding site and the other carboxylate group (C61, O61 and O62) bridges the two Zn atoms in a monodentate manner. With the flexible loop reaching in toward the active site, O1 of Thr109 at the tip of the loop makes a hydrogen bond to O61 of HDDP and O1 of Thr110 makes a hydrogen bond to O41 of HDDP, stabilizing the loop-in conformation. This observation supports the hypothesis that the presence of a moiety, capable of hydrogen bonding to Thr109 and Thr110 at the tip of the flexible loop (residues 105­115), is an absolute requirement for stabilizing the loop-in conformation. When the structure of the DHOase-HDDP complex is superposed on the structure of DHOase crystallized in the presence of DHO, the rmsd values of 343 common C positions in each subunit are 0.17 and 0.20 Å, respectively. These values are within the range of the respective ESU of the structures (0.10 Å for the structure of DHOase crystallized with L-DHO and 0.16 Å for the DHOase-HDDP complex, respectively). Therefore, no gross conformational change of the molecule occurs upon binding of the inhibitor, HDDP.

The final model for the DHOase-FOA complex contains 679 amino acid residues (residues 4­346 in subunit A and residues 4­107 and 115­346 in subunit B), 428 water molecules, four Zn atoms and two FOA molecules. The electron density corresponding to the residues 108­114 in subunit B are disordered in the DHOaseFOA complex. FOA mimics the product of the reaction, DHO, and contains one carboxylate group only (Scheme 2, (1)). FOA is located in the active site pockets of both subunits of E. coli DHOase with a full occupancy in subunit A and a partial occupancy in subunit B (Figure 1). The binding mode of FOA to the active site is very similar to that of DHO. Although the ring conformation of FOA is close to planar due to the double bond between the C4 and C5 atoms, the C2, O2, C5, C6 and O6 atoms of the FOA molecule lie in approximately the same positions as the equivalent atoms of DHO when each subunit of the DHOaseFOA complex and the DHO-bound subunit of the DHO/CA-asp complex structure are superposed (Figure 3). FOA makes contacts with the same protein residues as does DHO in the DHO-bound subunit of the DHO/CA-asp complex (side-chains of Arg20, Asn44 and His254, and backbone atoms of Leu222, Ala266 and Gly267). The fluoride atom of FOA, linked to C5 of the ring, is also in close contact with Asn44 (Asn44 N2  FOA F5, 3.1 Å in each subunit). In both subunits, a water molecule (or hydroxide ion) bridges the two Zn atoms that are 3.5 Å apart. The FOA molecule bound at the active site of subunit B was partially occupied and refined with an occupancy of 0.75 (Figure 1). In subunit A the flexible loop (residues 105­115) faces away from the active site and the loop-out conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with a neighbouring symmetry-related molecule (­x + 1, y + 1/2, ­z + 1/2). In subunit B, in contrast with the CA-asp-bound or HDDP-bound subunits, but in agreement with the ligand-free structure, parts of the flexible loop (residues 108­114) are disordered when the active site is partially occupied by FOA (Figure 1). Incompatibility of the loop-in conformation with the product-like molecule in the active site results in a disordered conformation for this loop and the partial occupancy of FOA in subunit B. Superposition of the DHOase-FOA complex onto the structure of DHOase crystallized in the presence of DHO has a rmsd for 343 common C positions in subunit A of 0.16 Å and for 336 common C positions in subunit B of 0.19 Å, indicating no gross rearrangement of the enzyme upon FOA binding. The mechanism of movement of the 105­115 loop We have previously hypothesised that the flexible loop moves from the loop-in conformation with CA-

asp bound at the active site to the loop-out conformation on conversion to the product DHO, facilitating its release. This proposal was based on a model in which DHO was placed in the CA-asp active site with the loop-in conformation. In this superposition, DHO can form a hydrogen bond with Thr B110; a short contact with Thr B109 is predicted. This suggested a mechanism for the conversion from the loop-in to the loop-out conformation. Conversion of the C4/O4/O5 carboxylate group of CA-asp to a carbonyl group in DHO prevents DHO from bridging the active site Zn atoms, causing the DHO molecule to move away from the Zn atoms, contacting Thr109 and forcing the loop into the out conformation. Analysis of the structures of the HDDP and FOAbound forms of DHOase, reported here, support this

mechanism. FOA, which lacks the carboxylate group capable of bridging the active site Zn atoms and of interacting with the flexible loop, cannot stabilize a loop-in conformation. Further if the loop were in, there would be a steric clash between FOA and Thr B109. In contrast, HDDP has two carboxylate groups to ligate the two Zn atoms directly and to form suitable interactions with the flexible loop. Together these features can stabilize the loop-in conformation without steric hindrance between the protein and HDDP. Implications for the design of more effective inhibitors Inhibition patterns for the two inhibitors used here were obtained with the E. coli DHOase. The data

822 were fitted by non-linear regression to the equation describing competitive inhibition, yielding inhibition constants (Ki values) of 1.3(±0.2) M for HDDP and 31.8(±1.6) M for FOA, respectively (Supplementary Data Figure 1). HDDP binds approximately 25 times more tightly than FOA to E. coli DHOase. The kinetic data can be reconciled with the structures of the inhibitor complexes. The divalent metal centre plays a critical role in catalysis, activating both the substrate and the hydrolytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack. Although FOA, a product-like inhibitor, interacts with the substrate-binding residues, it does not ligate the Zn atoms. As in the DHO-bound complex, a water molecule bridges the two Zn atoms. In contrast, HDDP uses its additional carboxylate group to ligate the Zn atoms directly. The carboxylate groups of HDDP are also involved in the stabilization of the loop-in conformation, which in turn increases the affinity for HDDP. The loop-in conformation observed in the CA-asp and HDDP-bound subunits is presumably energetically favoured by the formation of new hydrogen bonds with residues of the flexible loop and the liberation of ordered water molecules from the active site. This suggests that more potent inhibitors of DHOase should meet both criteria, that is, ligate the Zn atoms and simultaneously hydrogen bond to the flexible loop. Although HDDP, designed as a transition-state analogue, satisfies the two criteria described above and binds more tightly to DHOase than CA-asp or DHO (Km values 0.47 mM30 and 20.8 M,16 respectively), the Ki value (1.3 M) and the structure of

DHOase-HDDP complex indicates that HDDP is not a true transition-state analogue of E. coli DHOase. The proposed tetrahedral transition-state intermediate is expected to ligate two Zn atoms in a bidentate manner (Scheme 1).15,31 HDDP at the active site of the DHOase-HDDP complex provides a monodentate bridge to the Zn atoms (Figures 1 and 3). Further, HDDP has an additional carbon atom in comparison to the proposed tetrahedral intermediate. The C6 atom of HDDP makes a very close contact with O2 of Asp250 (Figure 3, HDDP C6  Asp250 O2, 3.1 and 3.0 Å in subunits A and B, respectively). Asp250 is proposed to act as the general acid/base required for proton abstraction and donation in catalysis.15,31 An inhibitor designed to relieve the short contact made by HDDP would be expected to bind even more tightly. Recently, Li and Raushel reported the synthesis of a suite of compounds, specifically designed to inhibit E. coli DHOase. 32 4,6-Dioxo-piperidine-2-(S)-carboxylic acid (Scheme 2, (3)) was found to be the most potent of these inhibitors with Ki = 76 M at pH 7.0. Although the ketone group at C4 of this compound can be hydrated in aqueous solution to form an analogue of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate, the majority of the compound exists in product-like forms and less than 25% in the hydrated form at pH 7. Increase of pH of the enzyme reaction medium resulted in higher Ki values (210 and 440 M at pH 8 and 9, respectively) due to the decreased ratio of the hydrated form to other species present in aqueous solution. This suggests that the constant equilibrium between several forms of the compound may not be

823 that are required for compounds to be effective inhibitors of DHOase. In addition to interactions with the residues that are involved in substrate or product binding in the active site, effective inhibitors require two additional features to be more potent. Firstly, they should possess a chemical moiety capable of directly ligating the active-site Zn atoms and secondly, they should stabilize the loop-in conformation of the enzyme that closes the active site during catalysis.

sufficient to ligate the Zn atoms and stabilize the loop-in conformation of the flexible loop. Most of the inhibitors of DHOase reported to date have been tested against hamster DHOase as potential anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory drugs. The differences between pyrimidine synthesis in malarial parasites and in humans make the enzymes involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis good candidates for anti-malarial chemotherapy. In particular, the low activity of DHOase relative to the other enzymes in the de novo pathway makes it a particularly attractive target.33 To design the most effective and specific inhibitors for malarial DHOases, it is necessary to understand the architecture of the active sites and the catalytic mechanisms of the enzymes from both human and malarial parasites. The atomic structures of mammalian and parasite DHOases are yet to be solved. Sequence alignment of the DHOases from E. coli and P. falciparum (Type II DHOases) shows a high level of similarity between the two enzymes with 96 identical residues (28% identity) and 136 conservatively substituted residues (69% similarity) over the 338 residues aligned (Figure 4). The metal ligand residues (His16, His18, Lys102, His139, His177 and Asp250 for E. coli DHOase and His13, His15, Lys97, His133, His169 and Asp256 for P. falciparum DHOase) are well conserved between the two enzymes, as are the residues involved in substrate binding (Arg20, Asn44, Thr109, Thr110 and His254 for E. coli DHOase and Arg17, Asn42, Thr104, Thr105 and His260 for P. falciparum DHOase). Not surprisingly, homology modelling (details not included) of P. falciparum DHOase using the structure of E. coli DHOase as a template predicts that the structure of P. falciparum DHOase is very similar to that of E. coli DHOase. Interestingly, the residues corresponding to the flexible loops (residues 105­115 for E. coli DHOase and residues 100­110 for P. falciparum) are highly conserved with eight identical and three conservatively substituted residues. The two threonine residues that make direct interactions with CA-asp or HDDP when the loop takes the in conformation, are conserved, suggesting that loop movement is a common aspect of catalysis for DHOase enzymes. Overall, the features involved in substrate binding, Zn coordination and the loop movement in the active site are predicted to be similar, reinforcing the view that the principles derived for the design of inhibitors from the E. coli structure will be applicable for the Plasmodium enzymes and ultimately for antimalarial chemotherapy. Conclusions The structures of E. coli DHOase, crystallized in the absence of active site ligands and in the presence of the inhibitors HDDP and FOA have been solved and refined. Analysis of the structures confirms the importance of loop movement in enzyme catalysis and reveals the details of inhibitor binding for the first time. Comparison of the binding modes of the two inhibitors, FOA and HDDP, defines the features
