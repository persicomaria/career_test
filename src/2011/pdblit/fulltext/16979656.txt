Abstract Cellular RA binding proteins are thought to play important roles in the metabolism of retinoic acid (RA), a hormonally active metabolite of vitamin A that has profound effects on cell growth, differentiation and morphogenesis. Binding of RA to type II human cellular RA binding proteins (CRABPII) has been investigated by NMR spectroscopy. The sequential resonance assignments of CRABPII in the presence of RA were established by heteronuclear three-dimensional NMR at pH 7.3. The resonance assignments of the bound RA were achieved by homonuclear two-dimensional NMR. The secondary structures of holo-CRABPII determined by NMR were essentially the same as revealed by the crystal structure of holoCRABPII. Most of the nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) between CRABPII and the bound RA were consistent with those predicted from the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII. The results suggested that the conformations of holo-CRABPII in solution and in the crystalline state are highly similar. Compared to apo-CRABPII, most part of the ligand binding pocket, especially the ligand entrance, was stabilized greatly by binding of RA. Ser12-Leu18, one of the structure elements that constitute the ligand binding pocket, became more mobile upon binding of RA. Intramolecular NOEs between protons of the bound RA indicated that the carboxylate end of the bound RA is well fixed but the L-ionone ring is mobile. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Retinoic acid (RA), a hormonally active metabolite of vitamin A, has profound e¡ects on cell growth, di¡erentiation and morphogenesis [1]. Either RA de¢ciency or excess results in developmental defects. The plethora of biological e¡ects of RA and

other retinoids are believed to be mediated by various nuclear RA receptors (RARs and RXRs), all of which are RA-activated transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of target genes [2]. In addition to nuclear RA receptors, two types of cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPI and CRABPII) are also implicated in RA signal trans-

duction [3]. However, their physiological functions are still under debate at present. It is thought that CRABPs may protect cells from the detrimental effects of RA by preventing it from being incorporated into membranes. Indeed, in tissues that express CRABPs, RA is predominately in the protein-bound forms. More recently, a model for RA metabolism with CRABPI playing more active roles has been proposed [4]. On the other hand, `knockout' mice de¢cient in CRABPII or both CRABPI and CRABPII appear normal except for some minor defects in limb development [5,6]. Both CRABPI and CRABPII are extremely conserved across di¡erent species [7]. Furthermore, the sequence identity of CRABPI or CRABPII between di¡erent species is much higher than that between CRABPI and CRABPII from the same species. It has been thought that the high degree of sequence identity is required not just for conservation of structure and ligand speci¢city but for maintaining interactions with other proteins such as RA-metabolizing enzymes [8]. Although the two proteins have similar speci¢cities and a¤nities for RA [9^11], they di¡er in spatial and temporal expression patterns and regulation, suggesting that CRABPI and CRABPII may play distinct important cellular functions. It has been shown that production of RA is correlated with the expression of CRABPII but not CRABPI [12]. Overexpression of CRABPII enhances cellular response to RA in breast cancer cells [13] but overexpression of CRABPI decreases the biological potency of RA in F9 teratocarcinoma cells [14]. The crystal structures of holo-CRABPI and holoCRABPII (both in complex with all-trans-RA) have been determined [15]. It appears that RA cannot enter or exit the deep binding pocket in the absence of major conformational changes in the protein. The crystal structure of apo-CRABPI reveals a slightly more open ligand entrance [16]. Unlike holo-CRABPI, which was crystallized in a monomeric form, apoCRABPI was crystallized in a dimeric form. Dimerization has been suggested to be the mechanism that allows RA to enter or exit the RA binding pocket and by which CRABPI interacts with RA-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P-450s. However, it is unclear whether apo-CRABPI is dimeric in solution. Recently we have shown that apo-CRABPII is

predominately monomeric in solution [17]. The ligand entrance in the solution structure of apoCRABPII is greatly enlarged relative to that in the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII and readily accessible to RA. Thus the widening of the ligand entrance required for entry of retinoic acid appears to be a property of monomeric apo-CRABPII. In this paper, we report the sequential resonance assignment and the conformational and dynamical properties of holo-CRABPII. The results suggest that the conformation of holo-CRABPII in solution is highly similar to that in the crystalline state. The isoprene tail of the bound RA is well ¢xed in the binding pocket but the ionone ring is mobile. Binding of RA causes signi¢cant conformational and dynamical changes in CRABPII. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sample preparation Expression and puri¢cation of CRABPII have been previously described [11]. Uniformly 15 N-labeled CRABPII was obtained by growing the expression strain BL21(DE3)/pLys containing the plasmid pET-17b/CRABPII in M9 media with 15 NH4 Cl as the sole nitrogen source. NMR samples of holoCRABPII in D2 O were prepared as described below. Lyophilized CRABPII was ¢rst dissolved in 50 ml of PBS bu¡er (20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride in 99.9% D2 O, pD 7.5, uncorrected). The protein concentration was approx. 40 WM. Alltrans-RA (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (Aldrich). The concentration of RA was approx. 3 mM. The RA solution was then added to the protein solution in aliquots of approx. 5 Wl under constant stirring in a dark room. The concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 was kept at less than 1.5%. The mixed solution was kept at 4³C overnight. It was then concentrated to approx. 0.6 ml, centrifuged and transferred to a NMR tube. H2 O samples of uniformly 15 N-labeled holo-CRABPII were prepared by the same procedure except that the protein was dissolved in PBS made in H2 O and approx. 10% D2 O was added at the ¢nal step. The ¢nal protein concentrations of the NMR samples were approx. 2 mM.

2.2. NMR spectroscopy All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA-600 NMR spectrometer at 25³C. For homonuclear 2D spectra, the spectral width was 8000 Hz in both dimensions. The carrier frequency was 4.70 ppm. The residual water resonance was suppressed by low-power presaturation. The relaxation delay was 1.2 s. The following spectra were recorded: one DQF-COSY [28,29] spectrum, three cleanTOCSY [30^32] spectra with mixing times of 20, 33 and 50 ms, and two NOESY [33,34] spectra with mixing times of 100 and 150 ms. The time domain data were composed of 2048U320 complex points for the DQF-COSY and NOESY experiments and 2048U256 complex points for the TOCSY experiments. The data were processed with the program VNMR v. 5.3 (Varian Associates). An approx. 30³shifted sine bell was applied in both dimensions for processing the DQF-COSY data. A gaussian and minus LB combination was applied in F2 dimension and an approx. 75³-shifted sine bell in F1 dimension for processing the TOCSY and NOESY data. The DQF-COSY data was zero-¢lled to 8192U4096 real points, and the TOCSY and NOESY data were both zero-¢lled to 4096U2048 real points. A ¢ve-order polynomial was applied for baseline correction in F2 dimension after Fourier transformation. All heteronuclear NMR data were acquired with coherent selection by pulsed ¢eld gradients and sensitivity enhancement [35]. The carrier frequency was 4.70 ppm for 1 H and 121.0 ppm for 15 N. The acquisition times and complex data points for the 2D 1 H15 N HSQC [35,36] spectrum were 1 H (F2) 121.9 ms, 1024 and 15 N (F1) 53.3 ms, 128 (32 transients). 3D 1 H-15 N TOCSY-HSQC [37] and NOESY-HSQC [37,38] spectra were recorded with the following acquisition times and complex data points: 1 H (F3) 121.9 ms, 1024; 15 N (F2) 15.2 ms, 32; 1 H (F1) 15.2 ms, 128. The mixing time was 35 ms for the TOCSYHSQC experiment and 150 ms for the NOESYHSQC experiment. The 1 H isotropic mixing in the TOCSY-HSQC experiment was achieved by a DIPSI-3 sequence [39]. A low power GARP-I sequence [40] was applied for 15 N broad-band decoupling during the data acquisition. The 2D data were processed with the program VNMR v. 5.3. The 3D data were processed with the program NMRPipe [41]. The 2D

data were weighted by an approx. 45³-shifted sine bell function in both dimensions and zero-¢lled to 2048 (F2)U512 (F1) real points. An approx. 75³shifted sine bell was applied in both F1 (1 H) and F3 (1 H) dimensions and a cosine bell in F2 (15 N) dimension for processing the 3D spectra. The ¢rst points in the F1 and F2 dimensions of the 3D data were calculated by linear prediction. Both 3D data were zero-¢lled to 2048 (F3)U128 (F2)U512 (F1) real points. The aliphatic part in the F3 dimension was removed after Fourier transformation. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Sequential resonance assignments and secondary structure identi¢cation of holo-CRABPII The sequential assignments were carried out following the standard procedure developed by Wuth« rich and others [18]. Spin systems were identi¢ed by the analysis of the 2D homonuclear TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra and the 3D 1 H-15 N TOCSYHSQC spectrum. Sequential links were obtained from NOE connectivities observed in the 3D 1 H15 N NOESY-HSQC experiment (Fig. 1). The assignments were helped greatly by comparison with the sequential assignments of apo-CRABPII [17] and the mutant R111M [19]. Except for eight residues that did not show cross-peaks in the 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum, all main chain amides were sequentially assigned (Fig. 2). Approx. 90% of the side chains were completely assigned. Secondary structural elements were identi¢ed on the basis of NOE patterns (Fig. 3). They were essentially the same as those observed in the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII, except that the N-terminus of the ¢rst K-helix was three residues shorter in solution. However, the chemical shift indices indicated that three residues are in a helical conformation. 3.2. Resonance assignments of the bound RA The 1 H resonances of the bound RA were assigned by a combined analysis of the 2D homonuclear DQF-COSY, TOCSY and NOESY spectra. As shown in Fig. 4, the ole¢nic protons were well resolved in the 2D homonuclear spectra. CH(7) and

CH(8) protons were distinguished from those of CH(10), CH(11) and CH(12) by the analysis of the DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra. CH(11) proton was distinguished from CH(10) and CH(12) protons

on the basis of their cross-peak patterns on the DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra. The assignments of other RA protons, including methyl protons, were based on the intramolecular NOEs (Fig. 5). The

methyl protons of CH3 (16) and CH3 (17) were assigned tentatively. None of the methylene protons of CH2 (2), CH2 (3) and CH2 (4) on the L-ionone ring was assigned at present. The 1 H chemical shifts of the RA bound to human CRABPII (Table 1) were the same as those reported for the RA bound to mouse CRABPII except CH(12) proton, which was 6.34 ppm for mouse holo-CRABPII [20]. They were

also similar to those of RA in CCl4 except for CH(8), CH(11) and CH3 (20) protons, which were 6.06, 6.96 and 2.36 ppm in CCl4 , respectively [21]. 3.3. Interactions between CRABPII and bound RA CRABPI and CRABPII are highly homologous in amino acid sequence (73.7% identity between human

CRABPI and CRABPII) [7]. The crystal structures of holo-CRABPI and holo-CRABPII can be superî imposed with an RMSD of 0.48 A for 136 CK atoms [15]. However, the solution structure of apo-CRABPII and the crystal structure of apo-CRABPI are signi¢cantly di¡erent, particularly at the ligand entrance, although they are similar in backbone folding [17]. While apo-CRABPI was crystallized in a dimeric form, apo-CRABPII is predominately monomeric in solution. This raises the question whether the solution structure of holo-CRABPII is the same as the crystal structure and RA binds to CRABPII in the same manner as revealed by X-ray crystallography. To address this question, we assigned the intermolecular NOEs between the bound RA and the protein.

The majority of the intermolecular NOEs were in agreement, at least qualitatively, with those predicted based on the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII [15], suggesting that RA binds to CRABPII in solution in a manner similar to that observed in the crystalline state. In particular, most of the contacts between the bound RA and the residues at the ligand entrance observed by crystallography were also detected by NOEs, indicating that the conformation of the ligand entrance of holo-CRABPII in solution is similar to that in the crystalline state. Furthermore, the secondary structures determined by this solution NMR study were essentially the same as revealed by the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII as described earlier (Fig. 3). Taken together, the results suggest that

246

the conformations of holo-CRABPII in solution and in the crystalline state are essentially the same. 3.4. Conformational and dynamical changes in CRABPII induced by binding of RA In our previous NMR studies, we have shown that the solution structure of apo-CRABPII is similar to the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII, but the ligand entrance is greatly enlarged in the apo solution structure and readily accessible to RA [17]. The enlargement of the ligand entrance of apo-CRABPII

relative to that of holo-CRABPII is due mainly to a concerted conformational change in three structural elements, namely the second helix, the LC-LD loop and the LE-LF loop. On the basis of the comparison of the solution structure of apo-CRABPII and the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII, we suggested that RA binding induces signi¢cant conformational changes in the protein. The suggestion is strengthened by the observation that the conformations of holo-CRABPII in solution and in the crystalline state are essentially the same as described in the last section.

The intramolecular NOEs of the bound retinoic acid are labeled with capital letters: A, CH(14)-CH(11); B, CH(14)-CH(8); C, CH(14)-CH(10); H, CH(8)-CH(12); I, CH(8)-CH(7); J, CH(11)-CH(12); K, CH(11)-CH(10). The intermolecular NOEs between the aromatic protons of Phe15 and the ole¢nic protons of the bound retinoic acid are labeled with lowercase letters: a, HN1 ,HN2 (F15)-CH(14); b, Hj (F15)-CH(14); c, HO1 ,HO2 (F15)-CH(14); d, Hj (F15)-CH(12); e, HO1 ,HO2 (F15)-CH(12); f, Hj (F15)-CH(10); g, HO1 ,HO2 (F15)-CH(10); h, Hj (F15)-CH(8); i, HO1 ,HO2 (F15)-CH(12); j, Hj (F15)-CH(11); k, HO1 ,HO2 (F15)-CH(12).

RA binding also induces signi¢cant changes in the dynamics of CRABPII. The most striking change in the dynamics of CRABPII was found in the second K-helix. In the apo form, the second K-helix is rather £exible as indicated by the paucity of NOEs and the fast exchanging amide protons, although chemical shift indices suggest that the segment is largely helical [17]. The K-helix is stabilized greatly upon binding of RA. In the holo form, all NOEs characteristic of a helical conformation were observed for the segment (Fig. 1), suggesting a stable helical conformation. To compare the dynamic properties of the apo and holo forms of CRABPII in more detail, we examined the intensities (as measured by peak heights) of the peaks in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra. In general,

the peak intensities of the HSQC spectra are modulated by both amide proton exchange and conformational exchange. As we showed in the previous NMR studies [17], amide proton exchange appeared to have little e¡ects on the peak intensities of the HSQC spectra, partly owing to a `water £ip-back' pulse sequence for the HSQC experiments that minimized water saturation and dephasing [22,23]. In fact, the average peak intensity of the slow exchanging amides was the same as that of all amides. Thus, variation in the line widths of amide resonances caused by conformational exchange was the major factor in determining the peak intensities of the two HSQC spectra. For apo-CRABPII, the intensities of the peaks in

the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum vary greatly with the amino acid sequence (Fig. 6B). About a quarter of residues show weak or no signals in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum. Some of them are situated in the turns or loops between elements of regular secondary structure. Surprisingly, many others assumed regular K-helical or L-sheet structures. Interestingly, most of these residues that show weak or no cross-peaks in the 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum are clustered around the

RA binding pocket, especially the ligand entrance, indicating that the RA binding pocket of CRABPII is rather £exible in the absence of RA. The intensities of the peaks in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of holo-CRABPII is much more uniform than those of apo-CRABPII (Fig. 6A). Five segments have signi¢cant increases in the peak intensities upon binding of RA (Fig. 6C and 7), namely Trp7-Arg11 (the middle part of LA), Met27-Glu42 (the second K-helix and N-terminal part of LB), Tyr56-Thr61 (the LC-LD loop and the N-terminal part of LD), Thr75-Gly78 (the LE-LF loop), and Thr131-Glu137 (the fourth residue of LJ

to the C-terminus). All these segments are clustered around the ligand binding pocket (Fig. 7). In particular, the second K-helix, the LC-LD loop and the LELF loop constitute the ligand entrance. Of the 20 non-proline residues that were in contact with RA [15], all but two residues (Arg111 and Met123) showed signi¢cantly increased peak intensities in the HSQC spectrum of holo-CRABPII. The results strongly suggest that binding of RA stabilizes the ligand binding pocket. The interpretation is consistent with the NMR studies of homologous proteins such as CRABPI [24] and intestinal fatty acid binding protein [25]. As mentioned earlier, eight residues showed no detectable cross-peaks in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of holo-CRABPII. Three of them (Asn2, Thr57 and Asn115) were not observed in the HSQC spectrum of apo-CRABPII either. Surprisingly, the other ¢ve residues (Ser12, Glu13, Asn14, Glu16 and Glu17) were observed in the HSQC spectrum of apo-CRABPII. All the ¢ve residues are situated in a short segment encompassing the C-terminal two residues of LA and the N-terminal two residues of the ¢rst helix, suggesting that this segment becomes more mobile upon binding of RA. The signi¢cance of the motion to the release of the bound RA will be discussed in a later section. 3.5. Conformation and dynamics of the bound RA Twenty-seven intramolecular NOEs involving both the ole¢nic and methyl protons of the bound RA could be identi¢ed in the NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 100 ms. The NOEs between the ole¢nic protons of the bound RA are listed in Table 2.

Quantitative analysis of the NOE cross-peaks is dif¢cult because spin di¡usion can not be ruled out. A shorter mixing time such as 30 ms used in the 13 Cedited NMR study by Norris and coworkers [20] may reduce or eliminate spin di¡usion, but the poor signal-noise ratio of the cross-peaks will make it impossible to accurately evaluate the NOEs. Qualitatively, the NOE cross-peaks are consistent with a cis conformation for the 6 s torsion angle and a trans conformation for the other torsion angles in the isoprene tail of the bound RA as revealed by the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII [15] and the 13 C-edited NMR study [20]. However, the NOEs involving CH(7) are all weaker than expected. For example, the distances between CH(7) and CH(8), between CH(10) and CH(11) and between CH(11) and î CH(12) protons all are approx. 3.0 A, and yet the volume of the NOE cross-peak between CH(7) and CH(8) is signi¢cantly lower than those of the other two pairs of protons (Table 2 and Fig. 5). By contrast, the corresponding peaks in both the 2D DQFCOSY (data not shown) and TOCSY spectra are all relatively strong (Fig. 4), indicating that the relaxation times of these protons are similar to those of others and longer than the mixing time (100 ms). Thus, the weakness of the NOE cross-peaks involving CH(7) is most likely due to internal motion. Since the isoprene tail of RA is a conjugated double-bond system, the most probable internal motion is about the 6 s bond that links the isoprene tail and the L-ionone ring. Most of the NOEs involving the methyl groups in the L-ionone ring of the CRABPIIbound RA are also weaker than expected, suggesting that the L-ionone ring is indeed mobile. The 6 s torsion angle may not be ¢xed as suggested by the crys-

The NOEs were picked by the program NMRCOMPASS 2.5 (Molecular Simulations) from the homonuclear 2D NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 100 ms. The relative volumes were obtained by integration using NMRCOMPASS. The NOEs involving the methyl protons are not listed because most of them are overlapping with other NOE cross-peaks.

tal structure of holo-CRABPII. A single ¢xed 6 s torsion angle has also been suggested by Norris and coworkers [20], but the NOEs between the methyl protons in the L-ionone ring and CH(7) are also weaker than predicted, indicating that the L-ionone ring is also mobile in mouse holo-CRABPII. Similar internal motions have been suggested for the bound RA in mouse holo-CRABPI [20]. The NOEs involving CH(14), on the other hand, are all stronger than expected. In fact, the NOEs between CH(8) and CH(14) and between CH(10)and CH(14) are stronger than that between CH(7) and CH(8) (Table 2). In the crystal structure of holoCRABPII, the distances between CH(10) and CH(14), between CH(8) and CH(14) and between î CH(7) and CH(8) are approx. 4.8, 6.8 and 3.0 A, respectively. Obviously, the NOE cross-peak between CH(8) and CH(14) is due to spin di¡usion. Spin di¡usion may also contributes to the NOE crosspeak between CH(10) and CH(14). The spin di¡usions can be mediated by protons on the protein and/or RA. Since only the methyl group of Met123 î is within 3 A distance of CH(14) and the methyl î group is approx. 7.5 A away from CH(8), the spin di¡usions are most likely through CH(12). Since only a structure rigid on the time scale relevant to the NOESY experiment can provide e¤cient pathways for spin di¡usion, it suggests that the carboxylate end of the isoprene tail is essentially ¢xed in the protein. The rigidity of the carboxylate end of the isoprene tail and the £exibility of the L-ionone ring of the bound RA correlate well with the a¤nities and speci¢city of CRABPs for retinoids. It has been shown that the carboxyl group is critical for RA to bind to CRABPs, while modi¢cations at the L-ionone ring and the C-7 and C-8 positions can be tolerated [15]. 3.6. Mechanism of RA binding Although the crystal structure of holo-CRABPII provides an atomic description of the interactions between CRABPII and RA [15], it also raises the question of how RA gets into and out of the binding pocket of CRABPII. RA is buried deeply in the binding pocket of CRABPII, with its carboxyl group interacting with the side chains of two arginines and one tyrosine at the bottom of the pocket. The L-

ionone ring is ¢xed snugly at the entrance of the RA binding pocket, with only one edge of the ring accessible to the solvent. The crystal structure of apo-CRABPI reveals a slightly more open ligand entrance, but the protein was crystallized in a dimeric form [16]. It has been suggested that dimerization is the mechanism that allows RA to enter or exit the RA binding pocket. Biochemical and NMR evidence, however, indicates that apo-CRABPII is largely monomeric in solution [17]. Dimerization apparently is not a prerequisite for entry of RA into the ligand binding pocket. The solution structure of apo-CRABPII reveals a much more open ligand entrance readily accessible to RA. Furthermore, the ligand entrance, including the second helix, the LC-LD loop and the LE-LF loop, is rather mobile. Arg111 appears to play a major role in maintaining the ligand entrance of apo-CRABPII in an open and dynamic structure [19]. The entry of negatively charged RA into the binding pocket may be facilitated by an electrostatic potential generated by the positively charged residues such as Arg111 and Arg132 at the binding pocket [26,27]. Binding of RA induces signi¢cant changes in the conformation and dynamics of CRABPII. The ligand entrance of holo-CRABPII is much smaller than that of apo-CRABPII, mainly due to a concerted movement of the second helix, the LC-LD loop and the LE-LF loop toward the center of the ligand entrance. For the most part, the binding pocket is greatly stabilized by binding of RA. The second helix, in particular, is very mobile and apparently disordered in the absence of RA and becomes a stable regular helix upon binding of RA. On the other hand, Ser12-Glu18, which encompasses the C-terminal two residues of LA and the N-terminal three residues of the ¢rst helix, becomes more mobile upon binding of RA. The high mobility of these residues may be due to some unfavorable interactions within the segment and/or between the segment and the bound RA. The unfavorable interactions may prevent the protein from binding RA more tightly than needed. In the middle of the segment is Phe15 whose benzene ring is close to ¢ve protons of the bound RA (CH(8), CH(10), CH(11), CH(12) and î CH(14), all within a distance of 4.0 A). The benzene ring is also stacked on the guanidinium group of

Arg132 that is hydrogen bonded to the O1 oxygen of the carboxylate group of the bound RA. Both the guanidinium group of Arg132 and the O1 oxygen of the carboxylate group of the bound RA are also hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr134. Furthermore, the benzene ring is in fast rotation on the NMR time scale because only one set of sharp signals was observed for the benzene ring. It is tempting to speculate that the mobility of the segment, particularly the rotation of the benzene ring of Phe15, may help to open the ligand entrance and release the bound RA.
