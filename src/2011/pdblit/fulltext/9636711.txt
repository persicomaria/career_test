The catalytic domain of a mosquitocidal toxin prolonged by a C-terminal 44 residue linker connecting to four ricin B-like domains was crystallized. Three ° ° crystal structures were established at resolutions between 2.5 A and 3.0 A using multi-wavelength and single-wavelength anomalous X-ray diffraction as well as molecular replacement phasing techniques. The chainfold of the toxin fragment corresponds to those of ADP-ribosylating enzymes. At pH 4.3 the fragment is associated in a C7-symmetric heptamer in agreement with an aggregate of similar size observed by size-exclusion chromatography. In two distinct crystal forms, the heptamers formed nearly spherical, D7-symmetric tetradecamers. Another crystal form obtained at pH 6.3 contained a recurring C2-symmetric tetramer, which, however, was not stable in solution. On the basis of the common chainfold and NADC-binding site of all ADP-ribosyl transferases, the NADC-binding site of the toxin was assigned at a high confidence level. In all three crystal forms the NADC site was occupied by part of the 44 residue linker, explaining the known inhibitory effect of this polypeptide region. The structure showed that the cleavage site for toxin activation is in a highly mobile loop that is exposed in the monomer. Since it contains the inhibitory linker as a crucial part of the association contact, the observed heptamer is inactive. Moreover, the heptamer cannot be activated by proteolysis because the activation loop is at the ring center and not accessible for proteases. Therefore the heptamer, or possibly the tetradecamer, seems to represent an inactive storage form of the toxin.

Introduction
Bacillus sphaericus produces several mosquitocidal protein toxins, including MTX, MTX2, MTX3 and Bin, which have very different modes of action.1­4 It has been suggested that Bin may form pores.5 MTX2 and MTX3 are related to the epsilon-toxin of Clostridium perfringens and are considered to increase membrane permeability.2 In contrast, MTX is an ADP-ribosylating toxin.1,6,7 It is produced as a single chain of 870 residues, which has been subdivided into a putative signal sequence (residues 1­29), a catalytic domain, a linker and four ricin B-like domains that are likely to attach to glycolipids.8­11 The initial product MTX30-870 is inactive but can be activated by proteolytic cleavage

around residue 264.12,13 In vivo, this activation occurs in crude mosquito larval gut extracts. It releases an N-terminal 27 kDa fragment, comprising residues 30­264, that functions as an ADP-ribosyl transferase, giving rise to modifications toxic for the host. Interestingly, MTX30-870 shows 31% sequence identity with the eukaryotic pierisins from Pieris brassicae and Pieris rapae (cabbage butterflies) that consist of 850 residues and align with only a few small gaps.14,15 Pierisin is known to ADP-ribosylate the N2 atom of guanine bases of DNA, resulting in apoptosis of the target cell.16 In contrast, the essential target molecules of MTX are not known. More detailed in vitro analyses using recombinant MTX30-870 demonstrated that MTX is activated by tryptic cleavage after Lys262 or chymotryptic cleavage after Phe264.12,13 In the following we refer to the cleavage after position 264.13 The resulting N-terminal fragment MTX30-264 showed ADP-ribosylating activity when isolated from the C-terminal fragment. Without such a separation, the C-terminal

1227 32,020 Da of residues 30­308 plus the N-terminal spacer. Consistently, this band was accompanied by two minor bands about 1 kDa above and below the major band, indicating a heterogeneity expected to hinder crystallization. However, the material crystallized well and showed a defined structure in chain segment 33­298 (see below). Presumably, the triple band was caused by partial proteolytic removal of the mobile N-terminal spacer and of the disordered C-terminal end of the linker. MTX30-308 was subjected to sizeexclusion chromatography, which showed a pure monomer of about 30 kDa at pH 6.3. However, at pH 4.3, it ran as a 1:4 (total mass) mixture of the monomer and an oligomer of about 280 kDa. Crystallization screens revealed two conditions, one at pH 6.3 yielding crystal form II and one at pH 4.3 giving rise to crystal forms I and III. Data were collected from mutant E197Q of SeMet-labeled MTX30-308 using one crystal of form I and one crystal of form III (Table 1). The third data set was from mutant E195Q of native MTX30-308 in crystal form II (Table 1). Structure elucidation The data obtained from the SeMet-labeled crystal of form I were subjected to a multiwavelength anomalous diffraction analysis (Table 1) that revealed 14 times the expected five selenium sites coded in the sequence. Density modification using non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) information improved the phases obtained from the selenium sites considerably, yielding a clearly interpretable electron density map that showed 14 molecules in the asymmetric unit. These 14 molecules were arranged in D7 symmetry in a nearly spherical tetradecamer. The protein model was subsequently refined to good-quality indices (Table 2). The chainfold of one molecule is shown in Figure 1; the packing of the tetradecamers is depicted in Figure 2(a).

fragment MTX265-870 remained non-covalently associated with the catalytic fragment, inhibiting its activity.17 A further analysis showed that the inhibition is caused by two regions consisting of residues 265­285 and 840­870. The inhibition type of segment 265­285 is competitive with respect to NADC, whereas segment 840­870 inhibits in a noncompetitive manner. Consequently, it was suggested17 that segment 265­285 may occlude the NADC-binding site, while segment 840­870 may deform the active center through an allosteric association. Here, we report the structure of MTX30-308, which comprises the catalytic domain followed by the activation region and the inhibitory linker, and we relate the structure to the established kinetic data.

Results and Discussion
Crystal production and data collection The catalytic domain MTX30-264 is toxic and cannot be expressed in Escherichia coli.13,18 However, the expression is reasonable when MTX30-264 is extended by the inhibitory linker to the ricin B-like domains. The expression level is improved further by applying the mutations E195Q or E197Q that destroy the catalytically crucial E-x-E sequence motif of this ADP-ribosyl transferase.19 Therefore, we expressed the two single mutants E195Q and E197Q of the chain segment comprising residues 30­308 as N-terminal fusion proteins with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). GST was released by proteolytic cleavage through thrombin, producing chain segment 30­308 with an additional 12 residue spacer at its N terminus. This fragment was crystallized and in the following is referred to as MTX30-308. Since the first ricin B-like domain starts at position 303,8,9 a defined conformation of the last six residues of MTX30-308 was not to be expected. SDS-PAGE showed a major band at 33 kDa, which corresponds well to the mass of

Crystal form III was refined to only RcrystZ24% (RfreeZ28%). At this point, the refinement was stopped because the structure and the local packing corresponded closely to crystal form I but the underlying data were quite inferior to those of form I. a In this refinement the data set at the inflection wavelength (Table 1) was used. b In all 14 asymmetric molecules the same 258 residues have a defined conformation. c The 248 residues of the stated segments are structured in at least one of the 16 asymmetric molecules. The average number of structured residues is 240. d This amounts to 0.37 water molecule per structured residue.

The data from the SeMet-labeled crystal of form III were subjected to a single-wavelength anomalous diffraction analysis, which yielded seven times the expected five selenium sites. Phasing based on these sites and on density modification using NCS resulted in a clearly interpretable electron density map. This map was used to build

a protein model that was subsequently refined. For unknown reasons, however, the refinement leveled off at an Rcryst of 24% (RfreeZ28%). Since the ° obtained 2.7 A resolution data set was clearly ° inferior to the crystal form I data at 2.5 A resolution and no novel information was to be expected, we stopped the refinement. As shown in Figure 2(b) the seven molecules in the asymmetric unit form a C7-symmetric heptamer, which utilizes a crystallographic 2-fold axis to form the same D7-symmetric tetradecamer as in crystal form I. Crystal form II was solved by molecular replacement based on the structure of a single MTX30-308 molecule from crystal form I. This method revealed 15 asymmetric molecules, which were subsequently adjusted by rigid body refinement. In order to locate remaining protein molecules, a residual electron difference density map was calculated showing clear density for a 16th molecule. Crystal form II was then refined to reasonable quality indices (Table 2). Since a defined packing of 16 completely asymmetric molecules is entropically unfavorable, we searched for local symmetries and detected a recurring C2-symmetric tetramer, which is shown in detail in Figure 3(b). Four of these tetramers form the ring depicted in color in Figure 2(c). This ring is quasi D2-symmetric. Consequently, the crystal contains an abundance of NCS elements that diminish the entropic barrier appreciably.

(b) Crystal form III shows the same D7 tetradecamer enclosing a crystallographic 2-fold axis in space group C2221. (c) Crystal form II contains 16 asymmetric molecules in space group P212121 that are organized in four tetramers (color-coded). Each tetramer contains a local 2-fold axis shown in Figure 3(b) that participates in the quasi D2 symmetry indicated by three black axes. The D2 symmetry relates the four tetramers to each other.

agrees with results from size-exclusion chromatography at pH 4.3, which shows a predominant oligomer with an apparent mass of 280 kDa. This is somewhat higher than the 7!32Z224 kDa expected for a heptamer. However, the higher apparent mass is explained by the more voluminous ring arrangement compared to the globular proteins used for column calibration. Since the observed value of 280 kDa is too small for the D7

tetradecamer, we conclude that at pH 4.3 MTX30-308 forms a C7 heptamer in solution, which then associates to the D7 tetradecamer observed in crystal forms I and III (Figure 2(a) and (b)). Each ° MTX30-308 molecule buries 1500 A2 of its surface on ° heptamer formation and a further 600 A2 in the tetradecamer. In crystal form II at pH 6.3 we find a peculiar packing of four similar tetramers (Figure 2(c)). An indication of such a tetrameric

Most likely, ring formation depends on the presence of the inhibitory linker (red) as it is an integral part of the contact. One molecule (front upper right) is color° ° coded for B-factors (average of all 14 molecules) from 20 A2 to 90 A2 (blue-green-yellow). The activation loop (AL), the ARTT motif around position 190 and the loops at positions 83, 120 and 150 are labeled. (b) A tetramer unit of crystal form II containing one 2-fold axis (black) that relates two dimers to each other. The black 2-fold axis participates in the quasi D2 symmetry depicted in Figure 2(c). The two oblique non-intersecting 2-fold axes (gray) run through each dimer, which is formed by a dark and a light-colored molecule. The association of the dark and light-colored molecules in each dimer may involve a domain swap of about 20 N-terminal residues (purple). The swap can be visualized by connecting the pink balls accordingly. These balls are at positions 45 (light purple) and 49 (dark purple) as well as at position 55 in all chains. The activation loop (green) is structured in the light-colored molecules but unstructured (two green balls) in the others.

assembly, however, was not observed by sizeexclusion chromatography at this pH value. In crystal form I, in all 14 molecules almost all residues except the activation loop (residues 262­269) and the N and C termini were modeled. Note that the segment comprising residues 262­269 contains the cleavage point for toxin activation.12,13 Therefore, in the following we refer to this segment as the activation loop. The B-factor distribution is shown in the D7 tetradecamer representation in Figure 3(a). The mobility is high in the N-terminal region of residues 50­90 and in the two loops at positions 120 and 190, all of which are at the outer rims of the D7 tetradecamer. The loop around position 190 contains the so-called ADP-ribosylating-turn-turn motif (ARTT), which is considered to determine the

substrate specificity.20 Moreover, the two loops at residues 83 and 150 are mobile and protrude radially from the D7-symmetric ring. The structure of crystal form II is not as well ° defined as that of form I because the 3.0 A resolution obtained is lower (Table 1) and the refinement quality is inferior (Table 2). In crystal form II, the chainfolds of the 16 asymmetric molecules resemble each other closely, except for the highly mobile ° loops, where deviations of up to 5 A are presumably caused by packing contact differences. Compared to crystal form I, some of the chainfolds differ by up to ° 5 A at loop 120 and at the ARTT motif. The 16 molecules are organized as four compact tetramers (Figures 2(c) and 3(b)), each of which buries as ° much as 5300 A 2 solvent-accessible surface

1231 to position 261 contain 49% identical residues and only a few small gaps in external loops, demonstrating a very close relationship. Consequently, the structure of MTX30-308 is most suitable for modelbuilding of the eukaryotic protein pierisin, which may facilitate the analysis of the pierisin function by mutagenesis. NADC-binding site The NADC-binding site of MTX30-308 derived from homologous enzymes is occupied by segment 270­ 283 of the inhibitory linker. After removing this linker from the model, the transferred NADC molecule still clashes with side-chains of MTX30-308 (Figure 4(b)), due to the inaccuracy of homologue comparisons and to deformations of the binding site introduced by the bound inhibitory linker. The nicotinamide moiety of the transferred NADC appears to be placed rather accurately, since it could form the two commonly observed hydrogen bonds to the backbone of the central strand b4,21 here to Trp98 of MTX30-308. As usual, the nicotinamide moiety is bound in a pocket lined by an aromatic side-chain, which is here the indole group of Trp158. The nicotine-ribose overlaps spatially with Glu195 of the 195E-x-E motif.19 This can be explained as Glu195 is obviously displaced by binding to Met276 O of the inhibitory linker (Figure 4(a)). The crucial Glu197 of the E-x-E motif forms hydrogen bonds to Ser142 (backed up by Tyr131) on one side and to Glu195 on the other. The most important hydrogen bond of Glu197, however, is to the 2 0 -hydroxyl group of the nicotine-ribose of the transferred NADC (Figure 4(b)), polarizing this group in support of the transferase reaction. Around the ADP moiety of NADC, Arg97 of strand b4 compensates the diphosphate charges of NADC. Asp99 likely fixes the adenine ribose by a hydrogen bond to a hydroxyl group. The guanidinium group of Arg101 stacks against the adenine, as known from many nucleotide-binding sites.28 Arg114 may pack from the other side against the adenine base and at the same time bind to the phosphate groups. All these putative interactions agree with those in other ADP-ribosyl transferases, corroborating the proposed NADC-binding site. Moreover, this close relationship indicates that MTX is likely to share a common reaction geometry and a common target recognition region with the other family members (Figure 1). Structure­function relationship MTX is activated by a proteolytic cut near residue 264,12,13 which is in an exposed loop that is highly mobile in crystal form I as well as in every other molecule of form II. In the remaining molecules of crystal form II it assumes a defined conformation as it participates in packing contacts. Being exposed and mobile (Figure 1), this segment is a primary target for proteases, explaining the cuts observed in vivo and in vitro.

area of the four single molecules. The tetramer is C2symmetric, containing a 2-fold axis that relates two dimers with each other. The dimers themselves contain a 2-fold axis that, however, does not intersect with the 2-fold axis of the tetramer. Moreover, the dimers seem to be connected internally through a "domain swap" of residues 30­52. Since the electron density supports these swaps only in some instances, the putative crossover region 50­54 was omitted from all molecules. Moreover, the swap was ignored when calculating the buried surface. In two molecules of each tetramer, the activation loop 262­269 is buried in an internal packing contact where it assumes a defined conformation (Figure 3(b)). It is disordered in the other two molecules. Comparison with related proteins The observed chainfold is typical for all known ADP-ribosyl transferases. In particular, the conformation of the four central b-strands (strands b4, b5, b9 and b11 of MTX30-308) showing an angle of 908 between the two central strands b4 and b5 (Figure 1) is a common feature.21 In order to quantify this relationship, we performed a general search using the program DALI.22 The search showed that the closest relatives of MTX30-308 are heat-labile enterotoxin,23 cholera toxin24 and pertussis toxin25 with Z-scores between 10.1 and 8.7. A more detailed superposition of MTX30-308 with these three toxins showed good correspondence in segment 93­231 with 109 residues ° on average being located within a 3 A distance of their counterparts. Moreover, on average 28% of these 109 residues were identical. The aligned segment 93­231 is marked in Figure 1; it should be considered the proper catalytic core of MTX. An accurate superposition with the related toxins and the generally high similarity in the whole enzyme family allowed the localization of the NADC-binding site of MTX30-308. For this purpose, we superimposed the known structure of cholera toxin with bound NADC26 on MTX30-308 and transferred the NADC molecule. The resulting NADC location in MTX30-308 is depicted in Figure 4 and used as a marker for the catalytic center in the other Figures as well. After classifying MTX30-308 structurally, we performed a general sequence search with BLAST27 in order to obtain further information on amino acid exchanges. The only proteins with a significant sequence relationship were another MTX variant from B. sphaericus (99% sequence identity) and two variants of the butterfly protein pierisin (90% mutual sequence identity), which were already known to be sequence-related.14,15 In view of the structure, however, the alignment of the pierisins reveals a split into three regions. The N-terminal residues 33­92 and the C-terminal residues 262­298 of MTX30-308 share only about 17% identical residues but many homologous exchanges, indicating a common chainfold. On the other hand, the proper catalytic core 93­231 and the 30 residues up

In all crystal structures, segment 270­283 of the linker between the catalytic domain and the first ricin B-like domain occupies the putative NADCbinding site, explaining why the proteolytic activation has to be followed by the removal of the produced C-terminal fragment in order to achieve catalytic activity.17 As shown in Figure 4, the most important part of this linker is segment 273D­F­D­ M­F­A­P­N­G. The overlapping binding sites of linker and NADC are in good agreement with the observed competitive type of this inhibition,17 because the linker may be displaced by high concentrations of substrate. It should be noted that the inhibitory linker is an integral part of the interface in the heptameric ring structure. Moreover, the heptameric ring buries the activation loop inside a channel with a diameter of ° about 30 A, where it is not accessible for normal-sized proteases. Accordingly, the ring structure prohibits catalytic activity in two ways: by burying the activation loop and by cementing the inhibitory linker in its position. Since we observed the heptamer in solution and in two crystal forms, we suggest that this heptamer, or possibly the D7 tetradecamer, represents an inactive storage form of MTX. The activation of MTX at the high pH within the larval gut is consistent with this proposal, as MTX30-308 oligomerizes only at pH 4.3. The low pH association may be explained by four carboxylate groups (Asp51, Glu124, Glu207 and Glu251) in the ring interface. Since three of the carboxylate groups are available from the outside, it is conceivable that external factors such as divalent cations may stabilize the heptamer even at normal pH. The location of the four ricin B-like domains is depicted in very general terms in Figure 5. ° These domains form approximately 30 A diameter spheres with N and C-terminal chain ° ends approaching each other within 5 A.9 A structure-based sequence alignment of numerous ricin B-like domains30-870 showed that the first respective domain of MTX30-870 starts five positions after the last structured residue, 298, and that each of the three linkers between the four domains consists of 11 residues. Despite the proximity of the N and C-terminal ends, a linker as long as 11 residues prohibits any prediction of the relative domain orientation and thus also any suggestion for the arrangement of about ten expected glycolipid-binding sites of these domains.11 However, apart from the known position of the first domain, a further fix point is available from the inhibitory action of the C-terminal segment 840­870.17 The inhibition is of a non-competitive type with respect to NADC pointing to an attachment blocking the ADP-ribosyl transfer without affecting the NADC binding site. This may occur through binding at the ARTT motif and/or at the protruding loop at position 150 (Figure 3(a)) considered to outline the docking area of the target molecule.20,21 Therefore, we suggest that the ricin B-like domains curl back to

Figure 5. Suggested arrangement of the four ricin B-like domains in relation to the structured part comprising residues 33­298 of MTX30-308. The proposal takes into account the connection of ricin B-like domain 1 to residue 298 as well as the presumed inhibitory attachment of the C-terminal residues 840­870 near the docking position of the target molecule at loops ARTT (pink) and L150 (yellow). The activation loop is green and the inhibitory linker is red.

the ARTT loop region, as indicated in Figure 5. Since the diameter of the ricin B-like domains matches that of MTX30-308, the presence of these domains is consistent with the heptameric structure because they protrude from the circumference (Figures 3(a) and 5) and are not likely to hinder each other. Therefore, the model of Figure 5 is consistent with the proposed storage form. Conclusions MTX30-308 should be subdivided into five segments: the 60 N-terminal residues with a high degree of variability (33­92), the 139 well-conserved residues forming the proper catalytic core (93­231), 30 further residues that vary greatly in the related bacterial toxins but agree well with the butterfly pierisins, the activation loop (262­269) and the inhibitory linker to the four ricin B-like domains (270­298). The high mobility of the N-terminal segment 33­92 and the possibility of a swap of segment 33­50 in crystal form II are intriguing. It is conceivable that this part of MTX may associate with cellular components. The structure of MTX30-308 explains the activation by a proteolytic cut near position 264 in an exposed, highly mobile loop. Such a cut leaves the inhibiting linker and the inhibitory segment 840­870 at their positions assumed in full MTX. However, if fragment MTX265-870 dissociates, an active ADP-ribosyl transferase is left behind. The surface structure around the ARTT motif and loop 150 recognizing the target molecule is now

1234 available and may be used for target identification. The known binding mode of the inhibitory linker and the suggested binding region of segment 840­870 explain the respective competitive and non-competitive types of inhibition. The C7 heptamer and/or the D7 tetradecamer found in the crystals may represent an inactive storage form of MTX.

Structure of Mosquitocidal Toxin RESOLVE33 was applied for density modification and phase improvement. Due to the 14-fold NCS, the resulting density was of high quality, so that initial model building with ARP/wARP34 yielded almost the full chain. The model of crystal form I was then completed with COOT35 and RAPPER36 and refined with BUSTER-TNT,37 using NCS constraints for 232 residues (33­76, 88­91, 93­129, 133­140, 144­149, 151­185, 200­291, 293­298). Water molecules were added automatically by COOT and inspected manually during the refinement. Crystal form II was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER.38 Molecule A of crystal form I was used as search model and fixed at the top scoring solution. A further 14 molecules were added one by one and always fixed at the respective top-scoring solution. The 15 molecule assembly was then subjected to a rigid body refinement with REFMAC.39 Subsequently, a 16th molecule was added by means of a difference density map. The phases were then improved using RESOLVE. The model was refined using BUSTER-TNT with NCS constraints for 170 residues (89­114, 125­132, 134­185, 196­261, 272­289). Structure validation was performed with WHATCHECK40 and MOLPROBITY.41 Structure similarity searches were carried out with DALI22 and SSM.42 Structures were superimposed with LSQMAN.43 Figures were prepared with POVSCRIPTC44 and POVRAY. Protein Data Bank accession codes The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2CB4 and 2CB6.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification and crystallization As described,13 the single mutants E195Q and E197Q of the chain segment 30­308 of MTX from B. sphaericus strain SSII-1 were expressed as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. GST was removed with thrombin. The resulting fragment MTX30-308 consists of a 12 residue N-terminal spacer, the catalytic domain, the activation region and the linker to the C-terminal ricin B-like domains. The fragment was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and 200 mM NaCl, dialyzed overnight against 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and subsequently concentrated. In order to characterize the aggregation state of the obtained protein by size-exclusion chromatography, we used a Superdex-200-16/60 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Mes (pH 6.3), or with 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.3). SeMetlabeling was achieved by the pathway inhibition method.29 During purification of the SeMet-labeled protein, all buffers were supplemented with 1 mM DTT to prevent selenium oxidation. Initial crystallization conditions were established using sparse matrix screens (Emerald BioStructures and Hampton Research). Two conditions were optimized and used in the crystallization trials performed with the hanging-drop method at 20 8C. Crystal forms I and III grew from a 1:1 mixture of a 10 mg/ml of protein solution and reservoir buffer A (0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.3) and 4­10% (w/v) PEG 4000) within four weeks to sizes of 600 mm!100 mm!100 mm. Crystal form II grew from a 1:1 mixture of a 10 mg/ml protein solution and reservoir buffer B (0.1 M sodium potassium phosphate (pH 6.3), 8­14% (w/v) PEG 8000 and 50­150 mM NaCl) within two weeks to maximum dimensions of 650 mm!100 mm!20 mm. For data collection, the crystals were transferred in three steps to 30% (v/v) glycerol in the respective reservoir buffer before they were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at 100 K. Data collection, phasing and refinement Each X-ray diffraction data set was obtained from a single crystal. The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data sets of form I and form III crystals were collected at BESSY (beamline BL14.1, Berlin/D) selecting the wavelengths according to X-ray fluorescence scans. The data set of crystal form II was collected at the Swiss Light Source (beamline X06SA, Villigen/CH). All data were processed and scaled using XDS.30 The selenium sites were ° established by calculating FA values up to 3.5 A resolution with XPREP (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, 2003) and using them in SHELXD.31 The expected 70 sites were found directly. Site refinement and phasing was performed up ° to 2.5 A resolution with SHARP.32 Using the NCS,
