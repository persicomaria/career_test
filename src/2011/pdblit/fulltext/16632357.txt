Analogs possessing subnanomolar ERb binding, greater than 100-fold ERb-selectivity, and oral bioavailability are reported. Ó 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The physiological effects of estrogen are mediated through the estrogen receptor subtypes ERa1,2 and ERb.3,4 While our understanding of the complex role that these receptors play in the body is incomplete, it is clear that decreasing levels of 17b-estradiol during peri-menopause are associated with bone loss, cognitive impairment, and hot flashes.5 Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) provides relief from these symptoms but does so with an increased risk of breast and uterine cancer as well as an increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke.6 The observation that 17b-estradiol binds ERa and ERb receptors with equal affinity, coupled with the differential distribution of these receptors throughout the body,7,8 provides an intriguing possibility that tissues can be targeted with receptor selective ligands. For example, ERb is expressed in the lung, prostate, and brain but is not the predominant receptor in the uterus or breast tissues. Consequently, a b-selective ligand could specifically target tissues which express ERb while minimizing the risks associated with the proliferative

effects of 17b-estradiol in tissues, such as the breast and uterus, which predominately express ERa. The identification of an ER subtype selective ligand is further complicated by the structural similarity of these receptors. In particular, the binding pockets of ERa and ERb were observed to differ by only two amino acid residues.4 In the ERb binding pocket, Met336 was replaced by Leu384 and Ile373 was replaced by Met421. In spite of the subtle changes in receptor isoforms, selective ERa7,9,10 and ERb11­18 ligands have been described in the literature. We recently reported a new class of potent, ERb selective phenolic tetrahydrofluorenone analogs which are exemplified by analog 1.19 In this paper, we will describe modifications to 1 aimed at improving the ERb binding, b-selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties (PK) of these compounds.

Analog 1 displayed poor oral bioavailability and high plasma clearance rates in rats. The poor PK was, presumably, the result of first-pass glucuronidation of the phenol group followed by rapid elimination from the rat. Several approaches aimed at improving the PK of these analogs were investigated. They included the synthesis of a series of 6- and 8-substituted analogs in an attempt to sterically minimize glucuronidation of the phenol, the synthesis of prodrug derivatives of the phenol, and replacement of the phenol by a fused pyrazole ring.20 The results from the first approach, that substitution at the 8-position was found to be preferable to substitution at the 6-position, helped define regioisomer21 15 as the target for the third approach.22 The syntheses of the pyrazole analogs 2­37 follow the procedures described in Schemes 1­4. Preparation of the requisite 2-substituted indanone 41 is described in Scheme 1. Reductive alkylation of 38 provided the monoalkylated product 39 in high yield.23 Bromination of 39 with NBS in dimethylformamide gave an approximately 85:15 mixture of the 4- and 6-regioisomers from which the 4-isomer 40 was obtained by crystallization from acetonitrile. Conversion of 40 into the 4-methyl indanone 41 was accomplished under Stille reaction conditions. Scheme 2 describes the Robinson annulation of 41 with alkyl vinyl ketones and cyclization under acidic conditions to provide the racemic tetrahydrofluorenone platform. Michael reaction of 41 with methyl vinyl ketone and cyclization of the addition product with pyrrolidine/acetic acid gave analog 42. The halogenation of the enone function of 42 provided the chloro and bromo derivatives 44. The addition product of 41 and ethyl vinyl ketone or propyl vinyl ketone was cyclized in a mixture of acetic acid/6 N HCl, with loss of the acetyl group, to provide aniline 43. A one-pot nitrosation and concomitant cyclization24 of anilines 43, and 44 after basic hydrolysis of the acetyl group, with nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate, potassium acetate, and dibenzo-18-crown-6 provided the racemic pyrazole analogs 2­17. Chiral resolution25 of selected racemic pyrazole products gave enantiomers A and B.

Derivatization of the bromo enone 44 is described in Scheme 3. Introduction of a trifluoromethylgroup was accomplished using copper(I) mediated chemistry.26 Phenyl and vinyl groups were introduced using Stille chemistry. The vinyl group was then converted into a cyclopropyl ring by reaction with excess diazomethane in ether. Removal of the acetyl group was followed by pyrazole ring formation and chiral resolution to afford 18­23. Solvolysis of the trifluoromethyl group 45 under basic conditions gave the esters 24 and 25 (see Scheme 4). The reaction apparently proceeds via deprotonation of the pyrazole nitrogen followed by conjugative elimination of fluoride from the trifluoromethyl group. Methanol or water then adds to the vinyl fluoride intermediate and the process is repeated until the ester is formed. Interestingly, there is no evidence for the formation of the acid product which would be expected from the addition of two moles of water. Halogenation of the pyrazolo tetrahydrofluorenone 45 was examined under a variety of reaction conditions

analogs.19 In both series, alkyl substitution of R1 with ethyl, propyl, and butyl groups imparted the most favorable ERb binding and b-selectivity. The large difference between the ERb binding values of the phenolic enantiomers was also seen in the pyrazole series, where the inactive pyrazole enantiomer 6 exhibited less than 1% of the ER binding of the active enantiomer 5. In general, an increase in the steric size of the R2 substituent produced an increase in ERb potency. When R1 was substituted with an ethyl group, the bromo 13 (2.2 nM), trifluoromethyl 19 (2.8 nM), and phenyl 23 (1.4 nM) analogs showed the most favorable ERb binding affinities, while the methyl 5 (190-fold), bromo 13 (113-fold), and trifluoromethyl 19 (130-fold) analogs displayed the greatest ERb selectivity. When R1 was substituted with a butyl group, the ethyl 10 (1.1 nM) and trifluoromethyl 20 (0.8 nM) analogs possessed the most potent ERb binding, while the trifluoromethyl 20 (220-fold) and methyl ester 25 (400-fold) analogs displayed the greatest ERb selectivity. In analogs where R1 was substituted with a cyclopropyl group, the cyclopropylethyl analog 17 (1.6 nM) showed the most potent and ERb selective binding affinity, although, it was found to be somewhat less selective than analog 15. Analogs 21 and 22, where R2 was substituted with a cyclopropyl group, also displayed slightly reduced ERb potencies when compared with analogs 5 and 8. Oxidation of the benzylic position to give ketones 26­30 had essentially no effect on ERb binding when compared with the parent analogs 5, 11, 13, 19, and 20. However, a small but significant decrease in ERb-selectivity was observed for these compounds. A comparison of the analogs, in which the pyrazole ring was substituted with a halogen 31­37, showed that decreasing steric size produced an increase in ERb potency (F > Cl > Br). The fluorinated analogs 33­37 showed a 1­9-fold improvement over the parent analogs in ERb binding and with the exception of 37, essentially unchanged ERb selectivity. Analog 35 (0.3 nM) showed an ERb potency which was 4-fold better than 17b-estradiol but with greatly improved ERb selectivity. Compounds were also evaluated in a cell-based transactivation assay28 utilizing HEK 293 cells which were stably cotransfected with human ERa or ERb and the alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. The transcriptional activity of the tetrahydrofluorenone analogs was determined and compared as a percent response of 17b-estradiol. These data are summarized in Table 2. Overall, the transactivation data tracked reasonably well with the ER binding data from Table 1. Several analogs displayed subnanomolar ERb transactivation values with the fluoropyrazole 35 exhibiting the greatest ERb potency (0.2 nM). The potent and selective EC50 values demonstrated that these analogs behaved as functional ERb agonists.

(see Scheme 4). Chlorination and bromination of 45 under basic conditions produced the anticipated pyrazole ring halogenated products 31 and 32. However, when the chlorination was performed in a non-polar solvent and R2 was a trifluoromethyl group, the reaction produced the benzylic dichloro analog 46. This reaction proceeded rapidly at room temperature without the addition of a free radical initiator. The isolated dichloro product 46 was found to slowly hydrolyze on silica gel during purification or in dilute acid to give the ketones 29 and 30. Extension of this reaction to analogs 45 in which R2 was a methyl, chloro or bromo group gave a low yielding conversion to the dichloro intermediate, in the case of the methyl analog, and a complex mixture of products with the chloro and bromo derivatives. Alternatively, oxidation of the chloro and bromo analogs 45 with potassium persulfate in aqueous acetonitrile provided the ketones 27 and 28. Few examples of pyrazole ring fluorination have been described in the chemical literature and this target presented a synthetic challenge. After surveying a variety of fluorinating reagents, it was found that reaction of 45 with xenon difluoride provided a low but useful yield of analogs 33­37. This procedure produced a complex mixture of products from which the desired product and a small amount of a mono-fluorinated benzylic product were isolated. The estrogen receptor binding affinities27 of racemic (A/B) and resolved (A or B) tetrahydrofluorenone analogs 1­37 are summarized in Table 1. Comparison of the ER binding SAR for the pyrazole and phenolic tetrahydrofluorenone analogs showed that, after correcting for enantiomeric purity, the pyrazole analogs displayed similar or slightly improved ERb binding affinity and selectivity in comparison with the corresponding phenol

As was the case in the phenolic series,19 an increase in the steric size of the R2 substituent produced a decrease in the ERb agonist response. Analogs that showed a moderate percent agonist response were then tested for their ability to antagonize estradiol's transcriptional effects. The cyclopropyl 21 and phenyl 23 analogs were observed to weakly antagonize the effects of estradiol (526 and 428 nM, respectively) and these analogs were identified as partial agonists/ antagonists. A summary of rat pharmacokinetic (PK) data29 is listed in Table 3. In contrast with phenolic analog 1, all pyrazole derivatives showed oral bioavailability in the rat (21­74%). In the ethyl series, the pair of resolved enantiomers showed relatively good PK

with the inactive enantiomer 6 displaying a slight advantage in AUC and plasma clearance rates over the active enantiomer 5. In the halogenated analogs, the trifluoromethyl analog 19 displayed improved PK over the chloro 11 and bromo 13 analogs. A comparison of the trifluoromethyl analogs 19 and 20 showed ethyl substitution to be preferable to butyl substitution. In addition to minimizing glucuronidation using a fused pyrazole group, an attempt was made to improve PK by minimizing the potential for oxidative metabolism. Potential metabolic sites on the tetrahydrofluorenone were protected from oxidative metabolism with the introduction of a fluoro, cyclopropyl, or keto group. Unfortunately, the PK data for analogs containing a

Further modification of the tetrahydrofluorenone class of ERb agonists will be the subject of forthcoming publications from these laboratories.

cyclopropyl or a fluoro group were not improved relative to related unsubstituted derivatives. For instance, the rat PK of the cyclopropyl analogs 17 and 21 were not significantly different from that of the methyl 5 or halogenated analogs 11 and 13. Likewise, the fluoro analog 35 displayed similar rat PK to that of the parent analog 19. In contrast, the ethyl substituted ketone 29 showed a greater than 2-fold improvement in AUC and plasma clearance over the parent compound 19. This analog displayed the best PK in this class of compounds and suggested that the benzylic position was a site of oxidative metabolism. The butyl substituted ketone 30, however, showed a similar PK profile to the parent analog 20 and reinforced the conclusion that substitution of the R1 group with an ethyl group was preferable to substitution with a butyl group. In summary, we have shown that a fused pyrazole is a suitable phenol group replacement in the previously described tetrahydrofluorenone class of ERb agonists. The pyrazole analogs were selective ERb agonists in a cell-based transactivation assay and showed a marked improvement in their PK properties over

In our experience, this assay provides IC50 values that are reproducible to within a factor of 2­3. With the exception of 17b-estradiol and analog 1, the majority of analogs were tested once in the ER binding assay. The analogs were tested in duplicate in the transactivation assay (Table 2). 28. Barkhem, T.; Carlsson, B.; Enmark, E.; Gustafsson, J.-A.; Nilsson, S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998, 54, 105. 29. Female Sprague­Dawley rats were dosed at 1 mpk IV and 2 mpk PO using a 1.0 mg/mL solution of compound dissolved in EtOH/PEG400/H2O (2:3:5). Plasma samples were mixed with acetonitrile, centrifuged, and analyzed by LC­MS/MS on an Applied Biosystems MDS SCIEX API 4000 tandem mass spectrometer/HPLC system.
