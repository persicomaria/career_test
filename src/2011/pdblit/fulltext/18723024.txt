Abstract Cysteine desulfurase plays a principal role in the assembly of iron ­ sulfur clusters by mobilizing the sulfur atom of L-cysteine. The active site cysteine residue of the enzyme attacks the sulfur atom of L-cysteine to form a cysteine persulfide residue, and the substrate-derived sulfur atom of this residue is incorporated into iron ­ sulfur clusters. Escherichia coli has three cysteine desulfurases named IscS, CsdB and CSD. We found that each of them facilitates the formation of the iron ­ sulfur cluster of ferredoxin in vitro. Since IscU, an iron ­ sulfur protein of E. coli, is believed to function as a scaffold for the cluster assembly in vivo, we examined whether IscS, CsdB and CSD interact with IscU to deliver the sulfur atom to IscU. By surface plasmon resonance analysis, we found that only IscS interacts with IscU. We isolated the IscS/ IscU complex, determined the residues involved in the formation of the complex, and obtained data suggesting that the sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU is initiated by the attack of Cys63 of IscU on the Sg atom of the cysteine persulfide residue transiently produced on IscS.

1. Introduction Cysteine desulfurase, a pyridoxal 5V -phosphate-dependent enzyme, plays a principal role in synthesis of sulfurcontaining biomolecules [1­ 7]. It catalyzes decomposition of L-cysteine into L-alanine and sulfur. In the course of the reaction, a substrate-ketimine intermediate is produced from L-cysteine and pyridoxal 5V -phosphate, and the sulfur atom of this intermediate is attacked by the catalytic cysteine residue, resulting in the formation of a cysteine persulfide residue at the active site of the enzyme [8,9]. The substratederived sulfur atom of the cysteine persulfide residue is incorporated into various sulfur-containing biomolecules such as iron ­ sulfur clusters, 4-thiouridine, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, and thiamin [1 ­ 7]. The genome analysis of Escherichia coli has revealed the presence of three paralogs of cysteine desulfurases: IscS

encoded by the iscS gene [10], CsdB encoded by the csdB or sufS gene [11], and CSD encoded by the csdA gene [12]. Among these proteins, CsdB and CSD are more closely related to each other, sharing about 45% sequence identity. IscS has only about 20% and 22% sequence identity with CsdB and CSD, respectively. All of these proteins have cysteine desulfurase activity, and Cys328 of IscS, Cys364 of CsdB and Cys358 of CSD function as the catalytic residues [9]. IscU, an iron ­ sulfur protein of E. coli and other organisms, is proposed to function as a scaffold protein for the assembly of iron ­ sulfur clusters [13 ­15]. Sequential assembly of labile [2Fe ­ 2S]2 + and [4Fe ­ 4S]2 + clusters occurs on IscU, and the clusters are probably used for maturation of apo iron ­sulfur proteins [13]. IscU is encoded by the iscU gene in the isc gene cluster of prokaryotes including the iscS gene [16]. Recently, it was demonstrated that IscS and IscU interact with each other to form a covalent complex and that the sulfur atom derived from Lcysteine is transferred directly from IscS to IscU [14,15]. Thus, IscS and IscU cooperate with each other in the assembly of iron ­sulfur clusters. In the present study, we examined whether IscU specifically interacts with IscS, or other cysteine desulfurases,

CsdB and CSD, also interact with IscU to deliver the sulfur atom to IscU. We further investigated the residues involved in the formation of the IscS/IscU complex, and discovered a clue to the mechanism of the sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials The sources of materials were as follows: pET21a(+) and His bind resin from Novagen (Madison, WI), QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), lysyl endopeptidase and 4-fluoro-7-sulfamoylbenzofurazan (ABD-F) from Wako (Osaka, Japan), CDP-Star from Roche (Basel, Switzerland), Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and Centricon YM-10 from Millipore (Bedford, MA), Capcell Pak C18 SG300 (4.6 Â 250 mm) from Shiseido (Tokyo, Japan), the silver stain kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA), and all other chemicals from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). 2.2. Purification of proteins The iscU gene was amplified from the Kohara miniset clone No. 430 [17] by PCR and inserted into the NdeI and XhoI sites in pET21a(+) to yield pUH12, which was used for the production of IscU with six histidine residues at the Cterminus (IscU-His6). A DNA fragment containing the iscU ­ iscS region was amplified by PCR and inserted into the NdeI and XhoI sites in pET21a(+) to yield pFH6, which was used for the co-production of IscU-His6 and IscS. Mutants of IscU (C37S, C63S and C106S) and IscS (C328A) were prepared with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was used as a host for the production of these proteins. The cells were disrupted in 20 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (10,000 Â g) and applied to a nickel-chelating column (7 ml). The column was washed with 100 ml of a binding buffer [20 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole] and 250 ml of a washing buffer [20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 60 mM imidazole], and proteins bound to the resin were eluted with 25 ml of an elution buffer [20 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 1 M imidazole]. IscS, CsdB and CSD were purified as described previously [9,11,12]. 2.3. Construction of iron ­sulfur clusters with IscS, CsdB and CSD The ability of IscS, CsdB and CSD to reconstitute the iron ­ sulfur cluster of ferredoxin was examined. Reconstitution was carried out in 50 mM Tricine ­ NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM L-cysteine, 2 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PLP, 0.1 mg/ml (8.1 AM) apo-ferredoxin from

E. coli and 4.3 Ag/ml (50 nM) cysteine desulfurase. Nonenzymatic reconstitution was carried out by using 1 mM Na2S instead of L-cysteine, PLP and the enzyme. The reactions were carried out in 0.1 ml solution in a 1.5 ml tube after replacing the air with N2 gas and shielding the solution with mineral oil. After 10, 30 and 120 min, 1 Al of 50 mM EDTA was added to 20 Al of the reaction mixture, and the solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at À 80 jC until use. Holo-ferredoxin was separated from apoferredoxin by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the protein bands corresponding to holoferredoxin were quantified. 2.4. Surface plasmon resonance analysis Surface plasmon resonance analysis was carried out with BIACORE X (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). IscS-free IscU was prepared from E. coli MG1655 Disc harboring pUH12 and immobilized on a sensor chip (CM5) with N-ethyl-NV (3-dimethyl aminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The chip was blocked with ethanolamine. Flow rate was 20 Al/min, and the sensor chip was regenerated with 5 M guanidine ­ HCl. 2.5. Identification of amino acid residues forming a covalent bond between IscS and IscU The copurified IscS/IscU complex (14 mg of protein) was incubated in 3 ml of 0.15 M Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.8) containing 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, and 4 mM iodoacetic acid for 2 h at 37 jC. After dialysis, the alkylated protein was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (15 Ag). The peptides were recovered with a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and suspended in 300 Al of 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were applied onto the Capcell Pak C18 HPLC column equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the column was washed with the same buffer. The peptides were separated with a 50-min linear gradient from 20% to 100% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the absorption at 215 nm was monitored. Each peptide was recovered and resuspended in 200 Al of 0.1 M Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM ABD-F. The labeling reaction was performed for 5 min at 50 jC in the presence of 1 mM tributylphosphine (TBP). The fluorescence of each fraction was measured at 520 nm with excitation at 380 nm, and the peptide that gave high fluorescence intensity was reanalyzed by HPLC. The primary structures of the peptides were determined with an automated protein sequencer, Shimadzu PPSQ-10. 2.6. Other analytical methods S0 was quantified by cyanolysis according to the published method [18]. The activity of IscS was determined as described previously [12]. Protein assay was carried out

3.2. Specific interaction between IscS and IscU Interaction between IscU and three cysteine desulfurases was examined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. IscU was immobilized on the sensor chip, and IscS, CsdB and CSD were used as analytes. Fig. 2 shows that IscS interacts with IscU. The response unit was increased by increasing the concentration of IscS. In contrast, no response was observed when CsdB or CSD was used as an analyte. This result indicates that IscU specifically interacts with IscS. Specific interaction between IscS and IscU was also observed in vivo. When the crude extract of the E. coli cells harboring pUH12 was subjected to nickel-chelating column chromatography, 45 kDa protein was copurified with IscU-His6 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Sequence analysis revealed that the copurified protein was IscS. IscS was not bound to the column in the absence of IscU-His6 (Fig. 3A,

3. Results 3.1. Assembly of iron ­sulfur cluster of ferredoxin mediated by IscS, CsdB and CSD We examined whether IscS, CsdB and CSD mobilize the sulfur atom of L-cysteine for the assembly of iron ­sulfur clusters in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1, each of these cysteine desulfurases facilitated the reconstitution of the iron ­sulfur cluster of ferredoxin. The cluster assembly was also observed by using Na2S instead of the enzymatic system, but the rate of the cluster assembly was much faster when the enzymatic sulfur delivery system was employed.

lane 2), indicating that IscS was bound to the column through the interaction with IscU-His6. 3.3. Disulfide linkage between Cys328 of IscS and Cys63 of IscU [19] We overproduced both IscS and IscU-His6 using pFH6 to characterize the IscS/IscU complex. The complex was obtained by nickel-chelating column chromatography (Fig. 3B, lane 1). In the absence of the reducing reagent, IscS and IscU behaved as a covalently bound complex in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B, lane 2), indicating that these proteins are bound to each other through disulfide or polysulfide bonds. The fraction also contained a covalently bound IscU dimer (Fig. 3B, lane 2). We analyzed the proteins bound to the nickelchelating column by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, and found that the fraction contained a heterotetramer of IscS and IscU (a2h2), dimeric IscU and monomeric IscU. The heterotetramer was composed of two covalently associated IscS/IscU heterodimers, and the two IscU subunits of the dimeric IscU were covalently bound to each other. The amount of S0 in these complexes was found to be negligibly small, indicating that the covalent bonds are disulfide bonds, not polysulfide bonds containing S0 between two cysteine residues. We next identified the amino acid residues forming the disulfide bond between IscS and IscU. The IscS/IscU complex was digested with lysyl endopeptidase after alkylation of free sulfhydryl groups. The peptides were separated by HPLC, and each fraction was treated with ABD-F and TBP. TBP was used to cleave disulfide bonds, and ABD-F was used to detect free sulfhydryl groups. As a result, only a peptide eluted at 37.1 min showed fluorescence due to the derivatization with ABD-F. The peptide was reanalyzed by HPLC after treatment with ABD-F in the presence or

absence of TBP (Fig. 4). The peptide not treated with TBP gave a peak at 37.1 min, which did not show fluorescence at 520 nm. The treatment with TBP resulted in cleavage of the peptide into two peptides, which were eluted at 22.5 and 33.8 min. Both of these peptides showed fluorescence at 520 nm,

indicating the presence of cysteine residues modified with ABD-F. N-Terminal amino acid sequences of the peptides at 22.5 and 33.8 min were determined to be TYGXGSAIAS and DLAVSSGSAX, respectively. The former sequence corresponds to Thr60 ­ Ser69 of IscU and the latter corresponds to Asp319­ Cys328 of IscS. Thus the disulfide bond was considered to be produced between Cys63 of IscU and Cys328 of IscS. It is notable that Cys328 of IscS is the catalytic residue, which is converted into a cysteine persulfide residue in the course of the reaction with L-cysteine. Cys63 of IscU and Cys328 of IscS were replaced by Ser and Ala, respectively, to produce IscU ­ C63S and IscS ­ C328A. Covalent bonds were produced neither between IscU ­C63S and IscS nor between IscU and IscS ­C328A. This result confirmed that the disulfide bond is produced between Cys63 of IscU and Cys328 of IscS. Since IscU ­ C63S did not form a covalently linked dimer, Cys63 of IscU is also involved in the formation of the disulfide bond between two IscU subunits. Mutation of Cys37 and Cys106 of IscU did not affect the formation of the IscS/ IscU complex and the dimeric IscU. 3.4. Activation of IscS by IscU [19] We found that the cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS increased 6-fold when a stoichiometric amount of IscU was

added to the reaction mixture. The IscU ­C37S and IscU ­ C106S mutants also caused the activation (4.5- and 6-fold, respectively). However, the IscU ­ C63S mutant did not enhance the activity at all, indicating that Cys63 of IscU is essential for the activation of IscS.

4. Discussion We have shown here that IscU specifically interacts with IscS, but not with CsdB and CSD. It has been reported that a deletion mutant of IscS lacking C-terminal residues 376­ 404 exhibited lower binding affinity for IscU [15]. CsdB and CSD lack this C-terminal region, which may account for the inability of CsdB and CSD to interact with IscU. IscS and IscU form a 1:1 complex, in which IscS and IscU are linked with each other through a disulfide bond between the active site Cys328 of IscS and Cys63 of IscU. The covalent complex of IscS and IscU is produced only in the presence of L-cysteine in vitro [14,15], which suggests that IscU reacts with IscS harboring the cysteine persulfide residue. Thus, it is likely that the disulfide bond was produced by the attack of Cys63 of IscU on the Sg atom of the cysteine persulfide residue. The attack of Cys63 of IscU on the cysteine persulfide residue also accounts for the activation of IscS. The attack by Cys63 probably expedites

the release of the substrate-derived sulfur atom from the cysteine persulfide residue. To increase the turnover rate of the cysteine desulfurase reaction, IscU must be dissociated from IscS immediately after its attack on Cys328 to make this residue competent again for the next reaction. Dissociation of IscU from Cys328 is probably achieved by DTT in our assay system. Since an hsp70-type molecular chaperone, HscA, and a co-chaperone, HscB, encoded by the genes in the isc gene cluster, have been shown to interact with IscU [20,21], these proteins may facilitate the dissociation of IscU from IscS in vivo. Previous reports suggested that the sulfur atom derived from L-cysteine is transferred from IscS to IscU and covalently bound to IscU [14,15]. If the dimeric form of IscU found in the present study is the molecule that attacks IscS to accept the sulfur atom, Cys63 of IscU is supposed to be the primary site for sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU (Fig. 5). The dimeric IscU with a disulfide bond between Cys63 reacts with IscS with the cysteine persulfide residue, resulting in the formation of a disulfide linkage between Cys328 of IscS and Cys63 of one of the two subunits of the IscU dimer, releasing the other subunit of IscU with persulfide on Cys63. IscS is a dimeric protein, and crystallographic analyses of the IscS homologs suggest that two subunits of IscS are associated with each other so that the two Cys328 residues are located on opposite sides of the dimer [22,23]. Thus, one IscS dimer is supposed to react with two IscU dimers in order to produce the a2h2 heterotetramer of the IscS/IscU complex, which was observed in the present study. Two IscU monomers are probably released concomitantly with the formation of one heterotetrameric complex of IscS and IscU. Recently, CsdB was shown to play a role in the assembly of iron ­ sulfur clusters in vivo [24]. CsdB, and perhaps CSD, is supposed to cooperate with unidentified proteins other than IscU to mediate the cluster assembly in vivo.
