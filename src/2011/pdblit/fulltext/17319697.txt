ABSTRACT: The solution structure of cupiennin 1a, a 35 residue, basic antibacterial peptide isolated from the venom of the spider Cupiennius salei, has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The peptide was found to adopt a helix-hinge-helix structure in a membrane mimicking solvent. The hinge may play a role in allowing the amphipathic N-terminal helix and polar C-terminal helix to orient independently upon membrane binding, in order to achieve maximal antibacterial efficacy. Solid-state 31P and 2H NMR was used to further study the effects of cupiennin 1a on the dynamic properties of lipid membranes, using zwitterionic chain deuterated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (d54-DMPC) and anionic dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) multilamellar vesicles. In d54-DMPC alone, cupiennin 1a caused a decrease in the 31P chemical shift anisotropy, indicating some interaction with the lipid head groups, and a decrease in order over the entire acyl chain. In contrast, for the mixed (d54-DMPC/DMPG) lipid system cupiennin 1a appeared to induce lateral separation of the two lipids as evidenced by the 31P spectra, in which the peptide preferentially interacted with DMPG. Little effect was observed on the deuterated acyl chain order parameters in the d54-DMPC/DMPG model membranes. Furthermore, 31P NMR relaxation measurements confirmed a differential effect on the lipid motions depending upon the membrane composition. Therefore, subtle differences are likely in the mechanism by which cupiennin 1a causes membrane lysis in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, and may explain the specific spectrum of activity.

Antibacterial peptides are widely distributed throughout nature and form an ancient and pervasive component of the innate immune system for invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, and even microbes themselves (1, 2). Several hundred antimicrobial peptides have been characterized to date, and their sequences are available together with a comprehensive list of reviews and publications (3). Since traditional antibiotic therapeutics target the receptors and enzymes that are components of the bacterial biochemical machinery, rapid adaptation has led to the emergence of a number of drug resistant bacterial strains, which is clearly a serious public health concern (4). The majority of antibacterial peptides appear to act via a specific, but not receptor-mediated, permeabilization of the target membrane (5-8). This confers considerable potential for the development of such peptides as novel therapeutic agents, in particular, those that preferentially lyse bacterial cell membranes. Hence there is much interest in understanding the mechanistic properties of antibacterial peptides and the factors that govern selectivity.

Although the sequences of antimicrobial peptides are enormously diverse, they can be broadly classified based on primary and secondary structures. By far the most abundant and well-studied are the linear helical peptides, which are generally short (<40 residues) and cationic, and adopt amphipathic R-helical structures in membrane environments (9). Typical examples of this group include the cecropins, magainins, and melittin (5). Several models have been proposed to account for the way in which these linear helical peptides interact with and disrupt the bacterial membrane, of which the barrel-stave and carpet mechanisms have been most widely applied. In the barrel-stave model, peptides aggregate at the membrane surface before inserting into the membrane via formation of a transmembrane pore (10-12). For the carpet mechanism, peptides assemble parallel to the membrane surface, forming a detergent-like monolayer (8, 13, 14). Regardless of the mode of penetration, ultimately the disruption of normal membrane function results in cell lysis. Arthropod venom has been identified as a rich source of antibacterial peptides, the vast majority of which conform to the linear helical classification, and are thought to play a role in protecting the venom apparatus against infection (15). Interestingly, however, these peptides display limited specificity, with many having the added ability to lyse erythrocytes, and also directly affect neuronal cell membrane potential (15-18). This general cytolytic activity suggests a

Structure and Membrane Activity of Cupiennin 1a dual role for the antibacterial peptides, which often act synergistically with other neuropeptide components of the venom, to enhance the overall toxicity (19). The balance between antibacterial and cytolytic functions for such dualrole peptides depends upon the structural features of both the peptide and target membranes. To date, a small range of cytolytic peptides have been described from the venom of spiders, and only for those of the labidognatha suborder (15). This includes cupiennin 1a, isolated from the venom of the neotropical wandering spider, Cupiennius salei (Ctenidae), a large nocturnal hunting spider distributed throughout the tropical rain forests of Central America (19-21). Cupiennin 1a, a 35 residue, basic peptide (sequence: GFGAL FKFLA KKVAK TVAKQ AAKQG AKYVV NKQME-NH2), shows significant antibacterial activity toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC1) between 0.3 and 5 µM (21). In addition, this peptide is cytolytic (MIC of 25 µM toward human erythrocytes) and insecticidal (LD50 of 5.9 pmol,mg-1 fly toward Drosophila) (21). CD studies show that, despite being unstructured in aqueous solution, cupiennin 1a contains significant amounts of R-helical secondary structure when in a lipid environment (20, 21). However, a helical net projection shows that cupiennin 1a has a unique amphipathic motif in which the N-terminus is connected by a spiral band of Lys and polar amino acids to the C-terminus (20, 21). Furthermore, structure-activity relationship studies conducted previously for the natural analogue, cupiennin 1d, suggest that the hydrophobic N-terminal segment primarily determines the antibiotic effects and insecticidal properties of these peptides, while the polar C-terminus seems to modulate peptide accumulation at negatively charged cell surfaces via electrostatic interactions (20). Interestingly, the mean hydrophobicity values and hydrophobic moment of the cupiennin peptides are particularly low in comparison with other antimicrobial peptides and, therefore, either the hydrophobicity of the N-terminal region is sufficient to induce membrane disruption or the high activity is related to their unusual distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues. Consequently, we now report the structure of cupiennin 1a in a membrane-like environment using solution state NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics calculations (22-25). While the conformation of the peptide contributes to understanding antibacterial activity, it is also necessary to directly investigate the peptide-membrane interaction. For this purpose, solid-state NMR methods have been widely applied to model lipid membranes (26-29). Naturally abundant 31P in the phospholipid head group and synthetically

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 11, 2007 3577 incorporated 2H in the acyl chains provide probes for investigating motion in the respective portion of the lipid molecule, over a wide range of time scales. For example, the 2H quadrupolar interaction can detect molecular motions in the order of approximately 10-100 kHz, and the 31P chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) is effective for probing rates of 4-6 kHz (29). Furthermore, relaxation measurements can provide insight into lipid molecular motions occurring on the nano- to millisecond time scale (28, 30-32). Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is, therefore, a useful method for studying the dynamics resulting from perturbation of the phospholipid bilayers by membrane active peptides. In this study, the solution structure of cupiennin 1a has been determined in a membrane mimicking solvent mixture, trifluoroethanol/water (TFE/H2O) (21). Furthermore, the effects of cupiennin 1a on the order and dynamic properties of lipid membranes were investigated using 31P and 2H solidstate NMR spectroscopy, in two model membrane systems representing eukaryotic (zwitterionic multilamellar vesicles (MLV) of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and prokaryotic (anionic MLV, DMPC/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, DMPG) cells. The results presented here provide some insight into the mechanism by which cupiennin 1a exerts both cytolytic and antibacterial effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS Solution-State NMR Spectroscopy. The isolation, primary structure determination, and subsequent synthesis of cupiennin 1a have been described previously (21). Solution structure studies were carried out in aqueous TFE, with the sample prepared by dissolving cupiennin 1a (5.3 mg, 1.3 µmol) in d3-TFE/H2O (1:1 v/v, 0.7 mL), to give a final concentration of 2.0 mM and pH of 2.55. A Varian (Palo Alto, CA) Inova-600 NMR spectrometer was used for acquisition of all NMR spectra, with a 1H frequency of 600 MHz and a 13C frequency of 150 MHz. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C, and referenced to the methylene protons of residual unlabeled TFE (3.918 ppm). Referencing of the 13C dimension of the HSQC spectrum (22) was achieved using the 13CH2 signal of TFE (60.975 ppm). Suppression of the water signal was typically accomplished by centring the transmitter frequency on this resonance, and applying low power presaturation from the proton transmitter during a 1 s relaxation delay between scans. Gradient methods for suppression were used in the DQF-COSY experiment (33). High-resolution 1D 1H NMR spectra were acquired for cupiennin 1a in aqueous TFE, with 0.038 Hz per point digital resolution. TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY experiments (34, 35) were collected in the phase sensitive mode. Typically, 64 time-averaged scans were acquired per increment with a total of 200 increments for each experiment, and the FID in t2 consisting of 2048 data points over a spectral width of 5795.4 Hz. The NOESY spectrum was acquired with a mixing time of 250 ms, while the TOCSY pulse sequence included an 80 ms MLEV-17 spin-lock (34). The HSQC experiment was recorded with an interpulse delay of (1/2)JCH ) 3.6 ms, corresponding to JCH ) 140 Hz. One hundred twenty-eight increments, each comprising 64 transients, were acquired over 2048 data points in the directly detected 1H, F2 dimension. A spectral with of 25 641.0 Hz was used in the 13C, F1 dimension.

3578 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 11, 2007 2D spectra were processed using Varian software (VNMRJ, version 1.1D). Data matrices were multiplied by a Gaussian function in both dimensions before zero-filling to 4096 data points prior to Fourier transformation. Structure Calculations. 1H resonances in the NOESY spectra were assigned using Sparky software (version 3.111) and a standard sequential assignment procedure (35). Each of the cross-peaks was integrated, and the volumes were converted to distance restraints using the method of Nilges et al. (23). For each symmetric pair of cross-peaks, the peak of larger volume was used. JNHRH values were measured from the high-resolution 1D 1H NMR spectrum, and dihedral angles were restrained as follows: 3JNHRH < 5 Hz,  ) -60° ( 30°, 5 < 3JNHRH < 6 Hz,  ) -60° ( 40°. For 3JNHRH values g6 Hz,  angles were not restrained. The absence of resolved splitting for an NH resonance implies that its 3JNHRH value is <5 Hz. Structures were generated from random starting conformations using ARIA (version 1.2) (36) implemented with CNS (version 1.1) (37). The standard restrained molecular dynamics (RMD) and simulated annealing (SA) protocol was used, with floating stereospecific assignments employed (38). A single ARIA run consisted of eight iterations, using optimized parameters based on those described by Pari et al. (39). In the final iteration, 60 structures were calculated, from which the 20 with lowest potential energy were selected for analysis. Three-dimensional structures were viewed using the program MOLMOL (version 2k.2) (40). Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy. Phospholipids were purchased from either Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) or Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and used without further purification. Cupiennin 1a (1 mg, 0.26 µmoles) was codissolved in a small amount of chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) with either DMPC (protonated and deuterated, DMPC/d54-DMPC, 2:1 mole ratio) or DMPC/d54-DMPC/DMPG (1:1:1 mole ratio) to give an overall lipid/peptide molar ratio of 40:1. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of N2, and the samples were dried under vacuum for several hours to ensure complete solvent removal. The samples were then resuspended in 52 µL of water, and submitted to five cycles of freeze-thawing followed by vortex mixing until a viscous transparent gel was obtained. They were then transferred to a 5 mm NMR rotor for magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments, or a 5 mm NMR tube for static analysis. Control samples of "pureDMPC" and "mixed DMPC/DMPG" were prepared in a similar manner without the addition of peptide. All NMR experiments were performed on a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) Inova-300 spectrometer, using a 5 mm Doty (Columbia, SC) MAS probe. 31P proton decoupled experiments were carried out at an operating frequency of 121.5 MHz, using a single 90° pulse for excitation, and were referenced to H3PO4 (0 ppm). Spectra were recorded at 30 °C, and typical operating parameters included a 3.8 µs 90° pulse, 2 s recycle delay, and 62.5 kHz spectral width. Generally, 12k scans were averaged and processed with 100 Hz of exponential line broadening. Deconvolution of static spectra into axially symmetric CSA and isotropic components was accomplished by straightforward nonlinear least-squares fitting of frequency-dependent intensities:

While principal CSA components | and  were not explicitly constrained to a specific isotropic value during the fitting, the isotropic frequency observed in MAS experiments on the same samples correlated well to the fit values. Deuterium spectra were recorded at 46.1 MHz using a quadrupolar-echo pulse sequence (43) over a spectral width of 200 kHz. Typical operating parameters included a 5 µs 90° pulse, 40 µs echo delay, and 0.4 s recycle delay. Generally, 150k scans were averaged and processed with 200 Hz exponential line broadening. Unoriented deuterium spectra of overlapping Pake patterns (43) were "dePaked" using single value decomposition (43) as well as a straightforward nonlinear least-squares approach. Numerical mechanics were facilitated by the Gnu Scientific Library v1.7 (44). Order parameters were calculated simply by measuring the quadrupolar splitting in the calculated 0°-oriented spectrum for each myristoyl-C2Hn acyl chain position and then dividing by 255 kHz (3/2 times the static coupling constant) (43). 31P relaxation experiments were carried out under MAS conditions (typically 6 kHz). Longitudinal relaxation times (T1) were measured using the inversion recovery pulse sequence with a recycle delay of 4 s and variable delay values between 1 ms and 3 s. Transverse relaxation times (T2) were measured with a Hahn spin-echo experiment with echo delay values between 0.1 and 18 ms and echo times set to integer multiples of the rotor period. Relaxation times were determined by fitting a single exponential to peak intensity decay versus time. Root-mean-square of noise was measured from empty spectral regions and used as the error in peak intensity data. RESULTS Solution-State NMR Spectroscopy. CD spectra have been recorded previously for cupiennin 1a and suggest that this peptide is unstructured in water but adopts an R-helical conformation in a 1:1 v/v aqueous TFE mixture (21). Therefore, NMR studies were undertaken using this solvent system. NMR spectra were acquired for cupiennin 1a in aqueous TFE, and proton chemical shifts were assigned using standard sequential assignment methods (25) and a combination of NOESY, TOCSY, and COSY experiments. RC resonances were identified by direct investigation of the RH/ RC region of a HSQC spectrum. These spectra and a summary of all assigned proton and RC resonances are given as Supporting Information. NMR structural analysis was also carried out in dodecylphosphocholine micelles (at a 40:1 lipid/peptide ratio, data not shown). The observed spectra and, therefore, the structure which cupiennin 1a is likely to adopt were similar in each media. However, final structures were calculated in TFE/H2O since the data obtained was of higher quality. The RH resonances demonstrate a distinct upfield shift from random-coil values (45) along the majority of the

sequence (Figure 1A), consistent with the peptide having predominantly helical structure (46). The exception to this is in the vicinity of Gln24, and the N and C-termini, in which regions the resonances were more random-coil like. Although a lack of defined secondary structure is anticipated at the ends of the peptide due to a reduction in hydrogen bonding (47), the trend toward random-coil structure observed near the center of the peptide suggests that it adopts a helixhinge-helix type conformation. This is further supported by the RC secondary shifts (Figure 1B), in which two distinct helical regions (encompassing residues 3-21 and 28-34) were identified by their significant downfield shift from random-coil values (46). NH secondary shift values deviate periodically over 3-4 residues, with hydrophobic residues generally producing resonances further downfield compared to those that are hydrophilic (Figure 2), characteristic of an amphipathic R-helix (47). The "zigzag" trend in the graph of NH secondary shifts is maximal between residues Lys7 and Ala22, suggesting that the amphipathicity is best defined in this region. Diagnostic NOE connectivities for cupiennin 1a in TFE/ H2O are given in Figure 3. Here a strong series of dNN signals are noted, in addition to a number of weaker dNN(i,i+2) NOEs.

Sequential dRN and d N NOEs also occur along most of the sequence. A significant number of medium range NOEs are present from 3 and 4 residues apart, particularly dRN(i,i+3) dRN(i,i+4) and dR (i,i+3) signals. No long-range NOE signals were observed, concordant with a lack of intermolecular association. The pattern of observed NOEs and their intensities is generally consistent with the peptide having helical structure along the majority of the sequence (35). However, the reduction in medium range NOEs in the region from A21 to A26 is further support for a helix-hinge-helix type structure in cupiennin 1a. A total of 646 nonredundant distance restraints were generated from the NOESY spectrum of cupiennin 1a, of which 143 were ambiguous. Ten dihedral angle restraints were also employed during the structure calculations, derived from the 3JNHRH coupling constants given in Figure 3. The conclusions drawn by examination of the NMR spectral data were confirmed by structural calculations, whereby 60 final structures were generated by the ARIA RMD and SA protocol, of which the 20 with lowest potential energy were chosen for analysis. Figure 4 shows the 20 lowest energy structures of cupiennin 1a in TFE/H2O, aligned over selected backbone residues. Superimposing the N-terminal helix (residues 3-21) led to a "fraying" of the C-terminal helix (residues 28-34). Similarly, superimposing the C-terminal helix caused the N-terminal helix to become indiscriminate. Clearly, cupiennin 1a adopts two well-defined helices, separated by a more flexible hinge region. The energy and structural statistics for cupiennin 1a in TFE/H2O are given in Table 1. Final structures demonstrated only minor deviation from idealized covalent geometry (e0.05 Å for bonds, e5° for angles). Just seven distance restraints were violated at greater than 0.3 Å, suggesting that the resultant structures adequately satisfy the NMR derived

data and are likely to be an accurate representation of the peptide in solution. Rmsd values were calculated for the structure ensemble over the entire peptide and are also given in Table 1. The rmsd for the helical domains indicated that the structures in these two well-defined regions agreed very

well with each other. A Ramachandran plot of the average  and  angles for cupiennin 1a shows that the majority of residues fall within the favored region for R-helical structure (Supporting Information). Furthermore, residues Gly3-Ala21 as well as Tyr28-Lys32 were well-defined (angular order parameters (S) > 0.9 for both  and ), but the remaining residues were poorly defined with low S values, particularly in the vicinity of Gln24 (Supporting Information). These data are all consistent with a helix-hinge-helix structure. The most energetically stable calculated structure of cupiennin 1a in TFE/H2O (1:1 v/v) is shown in Figure 5. Here the helix-hinge-helix structure is clearly evident. This representation also shows that the N-terminal helix is amphipathic, with obvious hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces, while the C-terminus is essentially a hydrophilic helix. 31P Solid-State NMR of Phospholipid Bilayers. Solid-state 31P NMR is able to detect changes in the dynamics and orientation of the polar region of phospholipid molecules (48-50). The 31P line shape or CSA of NMR spectra can reveal alteration of membrane topology or the membrane surface charge density (51, 52), or more specific alignment and motion of the lipid head groups (49, 52). Static 31P spectra were collected for DMPC and DMPC/DMPG MLV, both with and without cupiennin 1a (Figure 6). The unoriented line shapes, which reflect axially symmetric CSA properties, indicate that the bilayers are in the fluid or liquid lamellar (LR) phase (48). The 31P CSA for DMPC MLV was approximately -47 ppm, in close agreement with previously reported data (53), and the CSA reduces to -39 ppm upon addition of cupiennin 1a. The static line shape for mixed DMPC/DMPG MLV is consistent with a single axially symmetric 31P tensor with CSA of -39 ppm. This CSA, typical of PC and PG head groups (54), is significantly smaller in magnitude than that of DMPC alone and suggests a lack of lateral phase separations in this binary lipid mixture under these conditions. Addition of cupiennin 1a to mixed DMPC/DMPG MLV has a profound effect on the 31P line shape, with the signal revealing two contributing powder patterns. Deconvolution gave two liquid lamellar components with CSA widths of -40 and -25 ppm (Table 2) and respective fractional intensities suggestive of enriched but segregated DMPC and DMPG lipid domains.

Structure and Membrane Activity of Cupiennin 1a

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 11, 2007 3581 showed that the measured T1 accords with a correlation time of 1.4 ns, which represents the time constant of the 1H31 P interaction in a plane parallel to the bilayer surface (64). T2 relaxation is driven by molecular motion on the millisecond time scale, such as diffusion of the lipid through the bilayer and collective membrane slow-order director fluctuations (29, 30, 65). Where relaxation times shorten upon addition of peptide, the peptide may be perceived to have increased the intensity of motions at corresponding frequencies. Conversely, where peptide lengthens relaxation times over control samples, the peptide may be perceived to have restricted motions at the corresponding frequencies. Addition of cupiennin 1a to pure DMPC caused a 15% decrease in T1 and T2. By contrast, cupiennin 1a imparted longer T1 and T2 relaxation times on both components of the mixed lipid MLV; T1 times increased by 33%, while T2 times increased by 10-20% for each component. DISCUSSION Solution NMR studies presented here demonstrate that cupiennin 1a adopts a predominantly R-helical structure in aqueous TFE, consisting of two helical domains separated by a distinct disordered region (Figure 5). TFE acts as a membrane mimicking solvent by promoting the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (66, 67), and therefore, it is likely that the calculated structures persist in a bilayer environment. This is supported not only by results of previous CD experiments, which show that the peptide adopts an R-helical structure in the presence of TFE or phospholipid vesicles (20, 21), but also by the fact that NMR-derived conformations of a number of amphipathic R-helical peptides are similar in both TFE/H2O and lipid bilayers (66, 68, 69). Furthermore, the observed helix-hinge-helix structure occurs frequently in cationic antimicrobial peptides, particularly those larger than 20 amino acids in length. Often the hinge is initiated by proline, or less commonly glycine residues, which are known to disrupt helical structure (70, 71). Gly24 in the disordered region of cupiennin 1a may therefore contribute to the observed flexibility. Earlier structural studies of cupiennin 1a describe a unique amphipathic motif, in which a right-handed ribbon of positively charged lysine resides winds around a presumed linear helix (15, 21). However, in the NMR structure presented here, these positively charged residues describe a narrower grouping when the two R-helical regions are considered separately (lysine residues in both N- and C-terminal helices define an arc of 140°). Such an arrangement allows the N-terminal region to adopt an amphipathic conformation. In contrast, the C-terminal helix is essentially hydrophilic. As a result, it is likely that each helix has a different functional influence on the cytolytic activity of this peptide. Furthermore, the flexibility imparted by the central hinge would allow each helix to orient independently, thereby enhancing the membrane binding and permeabilizing ability of cupiennin 1a. Structural, antibacterial, and hemolytic properties of truncated cupiennin 1a derivatives have been characterized by Kuhn-Nentwig et al. (20). Deletion of nine residues at the C-terminus causes a decrease in cytolytic efficacy, particularly toward Gram-positive bacteria, while additional elimination of the N-terminal pentapeptide entirely negates

NMR of Phospholipid Bilayers. Static 2H NMR spectra of chain-deuterated phospholipids are sensitive to the orientation and mobility of the lipid acyl groups (55-57). The 2 H spectra were typical of a fluid bilayer (57, 58), with a small isotropic peak due to residual 2H in the water (Supporting Information). The order parameters, as detailed in Materials and Methods, for each d54-DMPC acyl chain position show little variation between typical values observed for control MLV samples (59-61) and those including peptide (Supporting Information). 31P NMR Relaxation Studies. MAS allows the recording of high resolution solid-state 31P NMR spectra where intensity from all orientations is averaged into a narrow peak at the isotropic chemical shift (62, 63). The 31P MAS spectrum of DMPC MLV with and without peptide gave a single narrow peak at -1.0 ppm while DMPC/DMPG revealed two resolved peaks at -0.9 and +0.2 ppm with intensities that reflect the molar ratio (i.e., 2:1) of each lipid (Figure 7); these peaks experience a slight upfield shift by 0.2 ppm when the peptide was included. The 31P MAS NMR relaxation times are reported in Table 2. T1 and T2 31P relaxation rates are sensitive to differential phospholipid head group mobility owing to an interaction of peptide with the membrane bilayer. T1 relaxation pathways are driven by molecular motions on the nanosecond time scale, such as rapid conformational changes and long-axis lipid rotation (29, 31, 64). At lower fields, the T1 of the phosphorus is predominantly determined by dipolar interactions with nearby protons and the motional model, both using the dipolar relation and incorporating anisotropic motions,

both antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. This is consistent with what is now known of the structure of cupiennin 1a, in that the cytolytic activity of the cupiennin peptides depends primarily on the amphipathic N-terminus, which is capable of inserting into the membrane, and is modulated by the C-terminus via electrostatic interactions with the cell surface (20). Since cupiennin 1a is both antibacterial and hemolytic, solid-state NMR experiments were performed on net anionic phospholipid bilayers by using DMPC/DMPG to electrostatically model prokaryotic cell membranes and zwitterionic DMPC bilayers to model eukaryotic cell membranes. An important detail underlying the study is implicit in the static 31P NMR data: MLV bilayers remain intact and maintain a liquid lamellar phase at 30 °C in the presence of cupiennin 1a at a lipid/peptide ratio of 40:1. The peptide appeared to maintain the same structure in dodecylphosphocholine micelles with a similar lipid molar ratio (NMR data not shown), and while the curvature is different, the R-helical structure is likely to be maintained in phospholipid bilayers. Although some peptides exhibit different helicities in detergent micelles and isotropic solvents (see, e.g., ref 68), the R-helical structure is usually preserved. Likewise, the helicity of cupiennin 1a as determined by CD is maintained in small unilamellar vesicles, but it is higher in negatively charged compared to neutral phospholipids (20). Thus although the phospholipid charge may influence peptide structure, the amphipathic R-helical nature of cupiennin 1a would most likely be maintained for both MLV systems studied. While the static 31P spectrum of the mixed DMPC/DMPG MLV appeared to contain only one distinct liquid lamellar component, the two peaks differing by 1 ppm in the MAS spectra suggest that there are two components contributing to the static line shape. These two components have only subtly differing principal CSA elements, which, together with comparable relaxation rate constants, suggest little difference in the environment and motions experienced by each component. While the relative intensities of the major and minor components in the MAS spectra were consistent with

the proportions of DMPC and DMPG, respectively, we can only safely assume that the major component, which appears at +0.1 ppm chemical shift relative to pure-DMPC MLV, is enriched with DMPC, and the minor component is enriched with DMPG, although there may be no segregation of enriched domains at all. These relative chemical shifts are consistent with reported correlation between upfield-shift of peak with decreasing negative membrane charge density (51, 52). The addition of cupiennin 1a to pure-DMPC MLV caused a narrowing of the CSA, and reductions in both T1 and T2, which could be a result of a change in motion, headgroup conformation, and/or correlation time. The presence of cupiennin 1a may have led to an increase in the motion experienced by the 31P nucleus at all frequencies: in accord with the 15% decrease in T1 (at 108 Hz), CSA (corresponding to103-104 Hz), and T2 (low-frequency motions). Together with the lack of effect on the 2H order parameters, the overall change in lipid dynamics would suggest that, if the peptide has inserted into the bilayer, there is little disruption of the bilayer integrity. The addition of cupiennin 1a had largely the opposite effect on mixed DMPC/DMPG MLV, and appeared to discriminate between the DMPC-enriched and DMPGenriched membrane components. The major, DMPC-enriched component of the 31P static spectrum had a CSA value similar to the pure-DMPC MLV, while the CSA of the minor, DMPG-enriched membrane component narrowed considerably. This result indicates a preferential interaction with netnegatively charged lipid membranes, and suggests that electrostatics play an important role in the interaction between cupiennin 1a and bacterial cell membranes. Given the cationic nature of the peptide, this is not surprising but is notably greater than previously reported for basic proteins (72). Changes in the 31P chemical shift can be related to the surface charge density of the membrane (54), with decreasing negative charge density causing a small upfield shift. An upfield shift of 0.1-0.2 ppm was observed in the 31P MAS spectra upon addition of cupiennin 1a only for the mixed-

Structure and Membrane Activity of Cupiennin 1a DMPC/DMPG model membrane system, thereby further implicating the presence of cupiennin 1a for negatively charged membrane surfaces. These shifts are greater than those observed by Grobner and co-workers (54) for A 40 with DMPC/DMPG bilayers, which is consistent with the greater positive charge of cupiennin 1a. Upon addition of cupiennin 1a, for each component of the mixed DMPC/DMPG MLV, T1 and T2 relaxation times lengthened. In contrast to the effect of the peptide on pureDMPC MLV, this corresponds to a reduction in motions at the 108 Hz and slow time scales, possibly due to changes in the fast axial rotation and collective motions of the lipids, respectively. The anisotropic motion of the phospholipid headgroup that dominates 31P-T1 relaxation exhibits a correlation time near a nanosecond (64). Therefore, T1 can lengthen by either a reduction or an increase in correlation time since this system is very near its T1 minimum already. Thus the increase in T2 can be mostly explained by changes in T1 processes, suggesting a shorter correlation time and, hence, the contribution of collective motions to these changes is highly unlikely. The changes in T1 and T2 are most likely due to changes in the fast axial rotation and indicate a strong interaction between the peptide and DMPC/DMPG phospholipids (28). The relative similarity in relaxation times between the DMPC- and DMPG-enriched components, in contrast to the differential observed in CSA, indicates that the components were distributed with respect to each other as very small domains, i.e., the DMPG-enriched component is unlikely to be segregated together with peptide in a single large domain on the MLV. Notably, upon association with peptide, the DMPG-enriched component revealed a narrowed CSA usually associated with increased head group mobility or a change in headgroup conformation (49), while the measured relaxation times suggest a relative reduction in mobility, albeit at different frequencies. The reduced CSA reports on changes in rotation of the phospholipid headgroup about the glycerol and the lipid long axis or an increase in the amplitude of wobble of the molecule about the bilayer normal (49). Diffusion over the surface of a planar lipid bilayer or MLV is too slow to cause the observed narrowing and would require a correlation time for the diffusion less than 100 µs (49). One explanation is that the reduced CSA is reporting on averaging of the shielding tensor between a planar and a more highly curved region. The differential effect observed at different time scales suggests a disruption to the bilayer structure and formation of a toroidal pore with the DMPG-enriched component lining the lumen formed by the peptide, similar to that described by Huang and coworkers for melittin (73). When a peptide is incorporated in the bilayer surface (or interfacial) region, it may act as a spacer between the lipid head groups and provide more freedom of movement for the acyl chains, thereby decreasing their order (74, 75). Since no disordering effect of cupiennin 1a was apparent by 2H NMR over the entire acyl chain, it appears unlikely that this peptide adopts a predominantly surface orientation by inserting into the interface between the head groups and the chains in either zwitterionic or anionic lipids. This again is consistent with examples such as melittin, which can associate with phospholipid bilayers as a transmembrane helix, yet show limited perturbation of the lipids by solidstate NMR (76). The behavior of cupiennin 1a contrasts with

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 11, 2007 3583 that of shorter linear peptides (25 residues) isolated from the venom of the Lachesana tarabaeVi spider, Latarcins (Ltc), which exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. A recent NMR study found Ltc2a to have a similar helix-hingehelix structural motif, but the peptide was only weakly amphiphilic (77). In addition, 31P NMR data of the effect of the peptide on phospholipid liposomes, leading to a broad isotopic peak, suggests the carpet mechanism for membrane destabilization by Ltc2a. Cupiennin 1a, however, led to formation of two 31P CSA, indicating formation of PC and PG enriched domains. Based on the solution structures calculated in this study, the length of the N-terminal helix of cupiennin 1a is close to 30 Å, which is also the average thickness of a bacterial cell membrane (78) or PC bilayer (79). The length of this helix is, therefore, sufficient to span the bilayer, and therefore, we propose a pore-forming mechanism in which this segment would adopt a transmembrane orientation. Such a pore may be of the toroidal type, as described for melittin (73), which would account for the significant perturbation of the lipid head group region as indicated by 31P NMR spectra of the anionic lipid MLV. However, as for the case of melittin (73), the mode of interaction may depend on several factors including the peptide/lipid ratio, lipid type, sample hydration, and temperature. The mechanism by which cupiennin 1a induces cell lysis is subtly different in neutral and charged membranes, and the strong interaction between cupiennin 1a and anionic lipids may account for the observed specificity of this peptide, whereby the antibacterial efficacy is significantly more pronounced than the hemolytic activity. The extent to which the observed differences correspond to different modes of interactions with prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes is not clear and invites further investigation. In conclusion, we propose that in neutral membranes, the amphipathic Nterminal helix of cupiennin 1a becomes buried within the core of the bilayer, acting as a driving force for pore formation and membrane disruption. In contrast, electrostatic interactions between the polar C-terminal helix and the anionic lipid head groups are anticipated to significantly disrupt the cell surface of charged membranes. The flexible hinge region of the peptide possibly may allow for the C-terminal portion to remain as an effective anchor at the membrane surface, while the N-terminal domain inserts into the hydrophobic region of the bilayer to form a structured pore.
