The Escherichia coli chaperone Hsp33 contains a C-terminal zinc-binding domain that modulates activity by a so-called "redox switch". The oxidized form in the absence of zinc is active, while the reduced form in the presence of zinc is inactive. X-ray crystal structures of Hsp33 invariably omit details of the C-terminal domain, which is truncated in protein constructs that are capable of forming crystals. We report the solution structure of a recombinant 61-residue protein containing the zinc-binding domain (residues 227­287) of Hsp33, in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of Zn2C. The zinc-bound protein is well folded, and forms a novel structure unlike other published zinc-binding domains. The structure consists of two helices at right-angles to each other, a two-stranded b-hairpin and a third helix at the C terminus. The zinc site comprises the side-chains of the conserved cysteine residues 232, 234, 262 and 265, and connects a short sequence before the first helix with the tight turn in the middle of the b-hairpin. The structure of the C-terminal zinc-binding domain suggests a mechanism for the operation of the redox switch: loss of the bound zinc ion disrupts the folded structure, allowing the ligand cysteine residues to be oxidized, probably to disulfide bonds. The observation that the C-terminal domain is poorly structured in the active oxidized form suggests that the loss of zinc and unfolding of the domain precedes the oxidation of the thiolate groups of the cysteine residues, since the formation of disulfides between distant parts of the domain sequence would presumably promote the formation of stable three-dimensional structure in the oxidized form. Hsp33 provides an example of a redox signaling system that utilizes protein folding and unfolding together with chemical modification for transduction of external stimuli, in this case oxidative stress, to activate the machinery of the cell that is designed to deal with that stress.

translationally, through the operation of an unusual redox switch.1 Under normal conditions, Hsp33 is present in the reducing environment of the cytosol, where it is monomeric and largely devoid of chaperone function. Under conditions of oxidative stress, the monomeric Hsp33 is rapidly activated to form an oxidized dimer. All Hsp33 homologues contain four conserved cysteine residues in a sequence motif CXCX27-32 CXXC located towards the C terminus of the w300residue protein (Figure 1). Under reducing conditions in the presence of zinc, the thiolate

Complete 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments were obtained for the folded zinc-bound form of Hsp33(227­287) using heteronuclear three-dimensional NMR spectra obtained with either uniformly 15N or uniformly 15N, 13C-labeled samples of Hsp33(227­287). HNCO,13 HNCACB,14 CBCA(CO)NH,15 and 15N TOCSY-HSQC16 spectra were employed. Side-chain assignments were obtained with HCCH-COSY and HCCH-TOCSY spectra.17 Water flip-back methods18,19 and/or gradient 15N coherence selection with sensitivity enhancement20 were used for water suppression. Isotopically labeled NMR samples for structure determination were prepared by transformation of a pET21a expression vector containing the coding sequence for the Hsp33(227­287) fragment into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. Expression was carried out at 15 8C in M9-minimal medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose. At the time of induction, ZnSO4 was added to a final concentration of 150 mM. The protein was purified from the soluble fraction under native conditions at room temperature by FPLC using an anion exchange column followed by a gel filtration column. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and MALDI mass spectrometry. Zinc-free samples of Hsp33(227­287) were prepared by the addition of excess EDTA under reducing conditions.

895 Despite the availability of two X-ray crystal structures of Hsp33,6,7 the structural changes that accompany zinc loss, disulfide bond formation and dimerization of Hsp33 are unknown. The X-ray structures show a domain-swapped dimer, but neither of the crystal structures gives any information on the redox-switching mechanism of Hsp33 because the full-length protein could not be

groups of these four cysteine residues coordinate to a single zinc ion,2 forming a compact folded domain.3 Under oxidizing conditions, the zinc is released and two disulfide bonds are formed between the two pairs of neighboring cysteine residues, (Cys232­Cys234 and Cys265­Cys268).4 The oxidized protein then dimerizes to form the activated chaperone.5

B, Ribbon representation of a single structure. C, Close-up view of a single structure showing the coordination of the zinc ion by four conserved thiolate groups. Structure calculations were performed using CYANA. The CANDID module of CYANA was exploited for automated assignment of the 3D 1H­15N and 1H­13C NOESY cross-peaks, followed by a manual check prior to the final calculations. Backbone dihedral angle restraints in helical and b-strand regions, which were derived from an HNHA experiment and from the TALOS program,21 were also used in the calculations. Regular tetrahedral geometry of the coordinating cysteine thiolate groups22 was imposed on the zinc site. Two hundred and fifty random conformers were annealed in 10,000 steps using the distance and dihedral angle restraints. The 50 conformers with the lowest target function were refined using the program AMBER. Finally, the 20 lowest-energy structures from the AMBER calculations were subjected to a round of refinement using the Generalized Born (GB) solvent module of AMBER.23 MOLMOL24 was used to generate A and B, and Chimera25 was used to generate C.

896 crystallized. Instead, proteolytic fragments consisting of residues 1­2556 and 6­233,7 crystallized under oxidizing conditions, were used. As indicated in Figure 1, the truncation of the C-terminal part of the protein results in each case in the loss of two of the Cys residues of the redox switch. Extensive conformational changes have been observed upon oxidation of intact Hsp33.3,8 Removal of the zinc, under either reducing or oxidizing conditions, exposes the substrate-binding site of Hsp33 and partially activates it. This partial activation, even under reducing conditions, was attributed to the unfolding of the C-terminal domain in the absence of zinc. The folded conformation in the reduced zinc-coordinated form of the domain is thought to block the substrate-binding site and the dimerization interface.3 Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of the folded, zinc-bound form of the C-terminal redoxsensitive domain of Hsp33, which forms a compact domain containing three helices and a two-stranded b-hairpin. The structure is consistent with a mechanism of redox activation where the dissociation of zinc first allows unfolding of the domain, then formation of disulfides between pairs of cysteine residues close together in the sequence.

Zinc-dependent Redox Switch Domain of Hsp33

Solution structure of the zinc-bound C-terminal domain of Hsp33 Complete 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments were obtained for the folded zinc-bound form of Hsp33(227­287). Structures were calculated using NOE constraints from 3D 1H­15N and 1H­13C NOESY spectra, using the programs CANDID and DYANA;9 structures were refined using the program AMBER.10 Structural statistics are shown in Table 1. A family of the 20 lowest energy structures is shown in Figure 3A, and a ribbon representation of a single structure is shown in Figure 3B. The first six residues of the construct (residues D227­K231) are disordered. The backbone of the Cys232­ Thr233­Cys234 sequence forms an irregular turnlike structure in order to accommodate binding of the thiols of the two cysteine residues with the zinc ion. Well-formed helices are present between residues 236­244, 248­258 and 276­285, and two b-strands between residues 260­264 and 271­275. The remaining two zinc-binding cysteine residues are present in the turn conformation between the two b-strands, at positions 262 and 265. The zinc ion is located at one end of the folded structure, linking the sequence before the first helix with the center of the b-hairpin (Figure 3C). Comparison of the structure with fold databases

Design of a recombinant form of the C-terminal domain of Hsp33 The amino acid sequence of Escherichia coli Hsp33 (Figure 1), together with structural information from the two X-ray crystal structures6,7 was used to design fragments of the protein that could be cloned and expressed in bacteria. The coding sequences for the fragments containing residues 179­287, 206­287, 218­287 and 227­287 were obtained from a pET3a plasmid containing the gene for intact Hsp331 by standard PCR methods, and recloned into a pET21a expression vector. All of these fragments were expressed in isotopically labeled form, and their 15N­1H HSQC spectra in the presence of zinc indicated that they were well folded, while removal of zinc under reducing conditions caused the resonances to sharpen and the spectral dispersion in the 1H dimension to collapse, consistent with the formation of a soluble monomeric unfolded protein.3 The shortest fragment containing the intact zinc site, Hsp33(227­ 287), was chosen for the structure determination by NMR, since HSQC spectra of the longer constructs showed cross-peaks in the same places as those for the shorter construct, and any additional crosspeaks appeared in the random coil region at the center of the spectrum, indicating that the additional sequences are unfolded. The 1H­15N HSQC spectra of this fragment in the reduced, zinc-bound form (A) and in the reduced, zinc-free form (B) are shown in Figure 2.

The solution structure of the zinc-bound C-terminal domain of Hsp33 was compared with other known folds using the programs DALI11 and TOP.12 A few distant similarities were found between some of the secondary structure elements

897 terminus, and, while the second helix contains three hydrophobic side-chains, two of them are bbranched, a valine and an isoleucine, which do not favor helix formation. Similarly, the only hydrophobic residues in the third helix are two isoleucine residues, again not ideally suited for stable helix formation. The amino acid composition of the b-strands is also not particularly favorable for stable structure: while the first strand contains the sequence Glu-Ile-Asp-Met, which would be favorable for b-strand formation, the second strand has the sequence Tyr-Leu-Phe, which places the hydrophobic leucine side-chain on the solvent side of the b-hairpin, with the two aromatic side-chains directed towards the interior. These relationships are shown in Figure 4B. Thus, the domain is capable of forming a hydrophobic core, but this core has many elements that reduce its stability, including destabilized secondary structure elements, a large proportion of hydrophilic side-chains even within the hydrophobic center of the molecule and some instances of hydrophobic side-chains on the solvent-exposed surface. These features are consistent with the observed tendency for the domain to unfold when the structure-stabilizing zinc ion is

of Hsp33(227­287) and small parts of much larger proteins. None of the matches contains a zinc site at the position found in the C-terminal domain of Hsp33. We conclude that the fold of this domain is a new one that has not been documented.

Insights into the unfolding of the zinc-free C-terminal domain The structure of the C-terminal domain suggests a possible reason for the structural instability of this domain in the absence of zinc, the hydrophobic core of the folded molecule is not favorable for stable structure. Firstly, the amino acid composition of the domain is unusually low in hydrophobic sidechains. In the 52 residues that constitute the folded part of the domain, there are only four leucine residues, one valine residue and four isoleucine residues, together with two tyrosine residues and one phenylalanine residue (Figure 4A). Secondly, the distribution of these hydrophobic side-chains is not ideal for the formation of the secondary structure of the folded domain. The first helix contains only one leucine side-chain towards its C

Zinc-dependent Redox Switch Domain of Hsp33

Mechanism of signal transduction The structural data suggest that a simple in vitro mechanism of activation of the chaperone function of Hsp33 by oxidative stress will be intimately associated with the zinc coordination. Removal of zinc is clearly a necessary prerequisite for oxidation of the cysteine thiolate groups to form disulfides, but unfolding of the domain must also be extensive before the oxidation reaction occurs. We infer this because of the nature of the oxidized form: the C-terminal domain is unfolded3 and contains disulfide bonds between the nearby pairs of cysteine residues, Cys232­Cys234 and Cys265­ Cys268.4 The oxidation event must occur a significant time after the zinc has been removed, allowing the protein to unfold completely. If this were not so, a non-negligible population of long-range disulfide bonds, between the cysteine residues far away in the polypeptide, might be expected to occur, since they are in close proximity in the zinc-bound form of the protein. On the other hand, it is possible that a more complex reaction occurs in vivo to promote formation of the correct disulfide bonds, through the action of a redox chaperone such as thioredoxin, or by some regulated means of zinc removal, or even by interaction of the N-terminal domain of the Hsp33 chaperone itself.
