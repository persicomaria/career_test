Structural and functional modules in RNA interference
Marcin Nowotny1 and Wei Yang2
RNA interference (RNAi) uses small RNA molecules to regulate transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression. In recent years, a number of structural studies provided insights into the molecular architecture and mechanism of functional modules of RNAi. Mechanisms of nucleic acid recognition and cleavage have been revealed by structural studies of proteins and their nucleic acid complexes involved in RNA biogenesis, for example, Argonaute, PIWI, RNase III, Dicer, Drosha, and DGCR8. While quite a few questions remain, an excellent structural and mechanistic overview of RNAi processes has already emerged. In this review, we examine functional modules and their assemblies in RNAi processes.

Argonaute (Ago, the nuclease component of RISC) uses the guide RNA to select complementary mRNA for degradation. In miRNA, base pairing between guide and target mRNA leads to translational inhibition. A recently discovered new class of RNAi, piRNAs (PIWI interacting RNA, PIWI and Ago are closely related), prevents the spreading of selfish genetic elements by methyl-dependent epigenetic silencing [6,7] and cleavage of transposon mRNA [8] (Figure 1b). The following functions are repeatedly required during RNAi: recognition of the 30 -end and 50 -end of RNA, binding of dsRNA, and cleavage of one or both strands of dsRNA at a defined distance from one end. Remarkably, nature uses a limited number of protein modules to accomplish these tasks (Figure 1c). PAZ domain recognizes the 30 -end of RNA in both miRNA and siRNA, the Mid domain of PIWI and Ago binds the 50 -phosphate, and dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBD) are found in Drosha, DGCR8, and Dicer. An RNase III-like endonuclease domain (endoND) carries out all dsRNA cleavage in RNAi. The PIWI domain in PIWI and Ago resembles RNase H and can nick mRNA (passenger or target RNA) that forms base pairs with the guide RNA. This is often referred to as the `slicer' activity. Some PIWI and Ago do not possess the slicer activity because of active site mutations, and their function is most likely to bind dsRNA. In this review, we briefly summarize the structural and functional modules in RNAi processes and how they are assembled into various complexes.

PAZ domain and 30 -end recognition Introduction
The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) is a major breakthrough in modern biology. RNAi influences cell proliferation, development, immunity, and tumorigenesis. Functions and processes of RNAi have been reviewed extensively [1­3]. Briefly, two major classes of RNAi are known -- small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and micro-RNAs (miRNA) [4,5] (Figure 1a). Both processes require cleavage of dsRNA to generate $20­30 bp dsRNA with 2-nucleotide overhangs at the 30 -ends. siRNA fragments are generated by Dicer from dsRNA precursors. The miRNA pathway starts in nucleus, where pri-miRNAa are processed by a complex of Drosha and DGCR8 proteins (Drosha-DGCR8) to produce $70-nt pre-miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs are then transported to the cytoplasm and cleaved by Dicer to make miRNA fragments. One strand of short dsRNA products (known as a guide RNA) is then incorporated into the RISC complex for selecting target mRNAs by base pairing. In siRNA,

The PAZ domain contains around 130 residues and binds the 30 -end of ssRNA or a 30 -end protruding from dsRNA [9,10]. The core of the PAZ domain consists of a short sixstranded b-barrel that resembles an OB fold and a bhairpin and a-helix on the side of the barrel (Figure 2a). In some PAZ domains two a-helices cover one end of the barrel (Figure 2b) [11,12,13,14]. Structures of the Drosophila Argonaute PAZ domain bound to ssRNA or ssDNA [11], human Ago PAZ bound to siRNA-like duplex [10], and T. thermophilus Ago (Tt-Ago) bound to a ssDNA guide strand and RNA/DNA duplex [15,16] reveal a conserved mechanism for nucleic acid recognition. PAZ approaches the 30 -end of RNA or DNA with its open b-barrel end (Figure 2b), and the interactions with the last two nucleotides at the 30 -end are conserved among these structures (Figure 2b). The orientation and structures of the remaining ds or ss nucleic acids are variable apparently owing to limited and nonspecific interactions with PAZ.

Major RNA interference pathways and domain composition of proteins involved in them. (a) Processing of RNAs in miRNA and siRNA. Pri-miRNA transcripts are processed by Drosha-DGCR8 in the nucleus and Dicer in the cytoplasm. The cleavage sites are indicated by orange triangles. siRNAs start as dsRNA and are processed by Dicer. In both cases the end product 20­30 nt RNA is incorporated into the RISC complex. (b) Model of piRNA pathway. Transposon mRNA is cleaved by PIWI using a piRNA guide strand. A fragment of cleaved transposon RNA is incorporated into Ago3 RISC and used to cleave the piRNA cluster transcript. Its fragment is incorporated into PIWI protein to start another round of the cycle. (c) Domain composition of proteins involved in RNA interference.

The last 2 nts at the 30 -end are stacked in the A conformation and inserted into a large binding pocket between the side of the b-barrel and the hairpin/helix element forming extensive polar and hydrophobic interactions with PAZ (Figure 2b). Several conserved residues including key aromatic side chains line the pocket and interact mainly with the phosphosugar backbone. In particular, a characteristically conserved tyrosine stabilizes the phosphate between the last two nucleotides with a hydrogen bond. The 30 -end is surrounded by hydrophobic and aromatic residues, and the 30 -OH is hydrogen bonded with a main-chain carbonyl oxygen. The W­C

edges of these unpaired bases are exposed to solvent, thus nucleic acid binding is nonsequence specific. There is no interaction with 20 -OH of the RNA, which agrees with the observation that PAZ binds either RNA or DNA.

dsRBD domain
The $70-residue dsRBD is present in many proteins involved in transcription, RNA processing, mRNA localization, and translation [17]. Structures of several dsRBDs have been determined. They all contain a central threestranded antiparallel b-sheet and two helices in the topological order of aÀbÀbÀbÀa [18­20]. The two

helices are roughly parallel and located on one side of the b-sheet. Structures of different dsRBDs in complex with RNAs (S. cerevisae Rnt1p [21], X. leavis RNA-binding protein A [22], and RNase III from A. aeolicus [23]) reveal two alternative binding modes. Most often a dsRBD binds dsRNA without sequence preference and interacts with the phosphosugar backbones in the A conformation, which is characterized by a wide minor groove and narrow major groove (Figure 2c). Charge­ charge interactions are formed between the helical dipoles (N-termini) of the a-helices and the phosphate groups surrounding the narrow major groove. Recognition of riboses instead of deoxyriboses is achieved through hydrogen bonding between protein side chains and 20 OH groups along the minor groove (Figure 2c). Alternatively, a dsRBD can recognize hairpin-loop structures, mismatches, and bulges in a sequence-specific manner by interacting with unpaired RNA or a loop region. For example the dsRBD from Rnt1p (yeast RNase III) binds a tetraloop (Figure 2d) and directs cleavage of adjacent dsRNA at a specific location by endoND [24].

helices. A pair of long perpendicular a-helices forms the active site as well as the dimer interface. (Figure 3a,b). The active site is at the intersection of the two helices and consists of two pairs of carboxylates, one pair from each helix. Dimerization results in a valley-shaped dsRNAbinding surface along the length of the dimer [23,31], ° and two active sites $20 A apart are symmetrically located at the bottom of the valley. The placement of the active sites matches the two scissile bonds two base pairs apart across the minor groove (Figure 3c). Divalent metal ions, preferably Mg2+, are essential for catalysis. Although in many RNase III structures only one metal is observed, biochemical data [32­34] and crystallographic studies of A. aeolicus RNase III complexed with RNA [31] and G. intestinalis Dicer with Er3+ ions [12] indicate that dsRNA cleavage occurs via the two-metal ion mechanism (see later discussion on RNase H). Structures of bacterial RNase III­dsRNA complexes (Figure 3c) [23,31] indicate that the specificity for dsRNA cleavage and not dsDNA or RNA/DNA hybrid is due to specific recognition of A-form duplex and 20 -OH groups.

Recognition of the 50 -end by Mid domain
The 50 -end of a guide RNA is recognized by RISC complex, and the cleavage site of target mRNA is determined by the number of base pairs from the 50 -end [25]. The Mid domain found in PIWI and Ago contains a four-stranded parallel b-sheet flanked by a pair of a-helices on each side (Figure 2e). The fold is similar to the sugar-binding domain of Lac repressor [26]. Structures of Mid domain associated with dsRNA and ssDNA (A. fulgidus PIWI protein bound to a small siRNA-like duplex [27,28] and T. thermophilus Ago with ssDNA and RNA/DNA [15,16]) reveal that it recognizes the 50 -phosphate specifically. Even with dsRNA most contacts are formed with the strand presenting the 50 -end. The 50 -end of either RNA or DNA makes a U-turn. The first base is flipped out and stacked with an Arg or Tyr side chain, and the 50 -phosphate is placed in a highly conserved pocket in the Mid domain interacting with invariant Tyr, Lys, and Gln residues (Figure 2e). Interestingly, the 50 phosphate is juxtaposed to the 3rd phosphate, and a metal ion coordinated by the carboxylate group of a C-terminal valine or leucine stabilizes these phosphates (Figure 2f).

Processing dsRNA by Dicer and Drosha­ DGCR8
The only crystal structure of full-length Dicer to date is that of G. intestinalis protein (Gi-Dicer), which consists of two endoNDs, PAZ, and platform domains (Figure 3d) [12]. The structure of Gi-Dicer has been likened to a hatchet with the dimeric endoNDs forming the blade and the PAZ at the end of the handle. Gi-Dicer cleaves dsRNA to 25 bps with 2 nt overhang at the 30 -end. Using structures of bacterial RNase III­dsRNA and PAZ­nucleic acid complexes as templates, a model of Gi-Dicer­dsRNA complex was proposed (Figure 3d) [35]. The platform domain between the endoND and PAZ appears to have a positively charged flat surface for dsRNA binding and separates the cleavage site (endoND) from the 30 -end (PAZ) by $25-bps. One can imagine that by slightly changing the size and shape of the platform domain, Dicer may generate 20­30 bp products. Gi-Dicer may be the minimal Dicer that is functional in vitro and in vivo [35]. As depicted in Figure 1c, Drosha­ DGCR8 microprocessor complex and other Dicers contain dsRBD in addition to endoND and PAZ domains. DUF283 in Dicer has been suggested to resemble dsRBD based on sensitive sequence comparisons [36]. In bacterial RNase III, each dsRBD domain is tethered to an endoND and contributes significantly to dsRNA binding (Figure 3c). The core of DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 in humans, Pasha in C. elegans) contains two tandem dsRBDs and complements Drosha in pri-miRNA processing as efficiently as the full-length DGCR8 [37,38,39]. In the structure of the DGCR8 core domain, the dsRBDs interact extensively to form a compact structure [40]. If these dsRBDs bind a single dsRNA,

dsRNA cleavage by RNase III endonuclease domain (endoND)
All RNase III-like endonucleases are dimeric and cleave dsRNA. The cleavage products of 50 -phosphate and 30 OH with a 2 nt overhang are characteristic of all RNAi pathways [29]. Bacterial RNases III and yeast Rnt1p are true dimers with one endoND in each subunit (Figure 3a). Dicer and Drosha are pseudo-dimeric, and the two endoNDs are tandem in one polypeptide chain (Figures 1c and 3b) [30]. Both endoND and the dimeric interface are highly conserved. A single endoND typically comprises seven awww.sciencedirect.com

the RNA has to be significantly bent. Alternatively they may interact with different segments or even separate molecules of pri-miRNA [40]. How dsRBDs increase the catalytic activity of Dicer awaits future experiments. So far, only a structure of mouse Dicer comprising a single endoND domain with dsRBD is available [41]. The absence of dsRBD in Gi-Dicer may be compensated by the platform domain (Figure 3d). Both Drosha and Dicer can process imperfectly basepaired dsRNA (Figure 1a). Bacterial RNases III can nick bulges present in dsRNA [42]. By analogy, Dicers may
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2009, 19:286­293

accommodate unpaired bulges and bubbles. Indeed Dicer is reported to cleave substrates with bulges or bubbles 6­10 bps away from the endoND active sites and located between the endoND and PAZ [35]. In addition the dsRBD of Dicer may facilitate the binding to a hairpin-loop region as shown in the structure of dsRBD from Rnt1p (Figure 2d).

DNA hybrid (Figure 4a). Further biochemical analyses have confirmed the intrinsic endonucleolytic activity of Ago [43]. Two catalytically essential carboxylates of RNase H are conserved in Ago and PIWIs that possess the slicer activity, and the third carboxylate, which could be Asn in some RNases H, is replaced by His and occasionally Lys or Asp in Ago (Figure 4a) [44]. RNase H cleaves RNA by the two-metal ion mechanism [45], the same as employed by RNase III. An important feature of two-metal ion catalysis is that metal ion coordination in the active site is substrate dependent. This ensures substrate specificity -- only when the proper substrate is bound can the metal ions be coordinated to promote catalysis [46]. This is probably why RNase H binds dsRNA and RNA/DNA hybrids but cleaves only RNA/ DNA hybrids [47]. Similar to the RNase H specificity, PIWI domains have high affinities for ssDNA, medium affinities for RNA/DNA and dsDNA, and the lowest for

dsRNA and ssRNA [27,48]. Yet the most efficient slicing activity has been observed with RNA/DNA hybrids followed by dsRNA [48].

RISC assembly
Ago is the core of the RISC complex, which uses $22 nt ssRNA processed as siRNA or miRNA to target and cleave mRNA. Functionally Ago recognizes 30 -end and 50 -end of a guide RNA, dsRNA formed between guide and target RNA, and cleaves target RNA at the 10th bp from the 50 -end of guide RNA. Structurally, Ago can be divided into four domains: N-terminal, PAZ, Mid, and RNase H-like PIWI domains. Except for the N domain, each has been ascribed with a specific function. The structures of Ago proteins with and without nucleic acid fragments [15,16,26,27,48] clearly show that each domain can move relative to the others (Figure 4b). Recently, structures of T. thermophilus Ago (Tt-Ago)

bound to a ssDNA mimicking a guide RNA [16] and RNA/DNA duplex [15] have been reported. In both structures the guide strand anchors the 50 -phosphate in the Mid domain and the 30 -OH in PAZ (Figure 4c). In the RNA/DNA complex (with DNA as the guide strand) the duplex can only be traced for the first 10­11 base pairs from the 50 -end of the guide strand. Nucleotides 10 and 11 of the target strand are in the vicinity of the active site and are partially disordered because of the mismatch introduced there to prevent cleavage. Also visible in the electron density are the last three nucleotides of the guide strand bound to the PAZ domain. To accommodate the RNA/DNA duplex the central groove is significantly wider than in other Ago structures. This is a result of large movements of the N-ter and PAZ domains which are flexible and can be compared to two lobster claws, while the Mid and PIWI (RNase H) domains of Ago may be compared to the lobster tail and head. When fully stretched, it can accommodate >10 bp of dsRNA or RNA/DNA from the 50 -end of a guide RNA. The structure demonstrates that this so-called `seed region' is key for target recognition through base pairing, which is also confirmed by biochemical data. Guide strands as short as 9 nt can support cleavage and introduction of bulges or mismatches in the seed region leads to a decreased cleavage, while even up to six contiguous mismatches were tolerated in the 30 -end region of the guide after the active site [15].

Conclusions and prospects
Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of RNAi from the structural perspective, but structures of key protein­RNA complexes remain to be determined, for example Drosha, the N-terminal domains in Droshas and Dicers, and Ago complexed with dsRNA substrates longer than 10 bps. In addition, new RNAi pathways are being discovered [8,49] and new Dicer and Slicer variations may emerge with different substrate specificity. Structural biology will likely continue to play a central role in enlightening RNAi pathways.
