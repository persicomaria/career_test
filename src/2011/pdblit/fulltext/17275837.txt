Abstract--Structure-based drug design of novel isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide inhibitors of PKB as potential antitumour agents was investigated. Constrained pyrrolidine analogues that mimicked the bound conformation of linear prototypes were identified and investigated by co-crystal structure determinations with the related protein PKA. Detailed variation in the binding modes between inhibitors with similar overall conformations was observed. Potent PKB inhibitors from this series inhibited GSK3b phosphorylation in cellular assays, consistent with inhibition of PKB kinase activity in cells. Ó 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Protein kinase B (PKB, or Akt) is an important protein involved in the control of cell proliferation and survival, and is a key downstream component of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway.1­5 In response to receptor tyrosine kinase activation by extracellular hormones, PI3K activation in turn produces phosphatidylinositols anchored to the inner side of the plasma membrane. Cytosolic PKB binds to these through a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, translocating the protein to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by phosphorylations on Ser473 and Thr308. Activated PKB phosphorylates a variety of protein substrates, including, for example, GSK-3b, FKHRL1, BAD and mTOR, and signals to pathways controlling cell proliferation, protein translation, cell survival and apoptosis, and progression through the cell cycle. There are 3 known isoforms of PKB (a, b and c). Recent in vitro research suggests that dual inhibitors of PKB-a and

PKB-b may be more effective than inhibitors of either isoform alone.6,7 There is substantial evidence to suggest that deregulation of signalling on the PI3K pathway, and in particular through PKB, is intimate to the development of some human cancers.2,3 Loss of function of the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which dephosphorylates 3 0 -phosphatidylinositols, results in overactivation of signalling through PKB. PTEN is frequently deleted or mutated in human tumours, notably glioblastoma, endometrial and prostate cancers. Amplification and mutation of the gene encoding the PI3K 110a catalytic subunit are also frequently observed in human cancers, particularly ovarian and cervical tumours, resulting in overactivation of the pathway. The overexpression of Erb2 also leads to constitutive PKB activity in breast and other tumours. For these reasons, inhibitors that prevent the phosphorylation of substrates by PKB offer potential as therapies for human malignancies.8 Blockade of signalling via PKB might be achieved by preventing the phosphorylation, and hence the activation, of the enzyme by inhibition of upstream kinases such as PDK1 or through inhibition of the association of the PH domain of the enzyme with PIs.6,7 Alternatively,

direct inhibition of the kinase activity of PKB is possible, and a number of ATP-competitive inhibitors of PKB have been identified.9­14 Most recently, preliminary reports of in vivo efficacy in rodent models have been made for a series of pyridine-isoquinolines.12,15 As part of a programme to discover and optimise new, small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitors of PKB as potential cancer therapeutics,16 we have explored compounds based on the isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide kinase inhibitor template.17 Prior to this study, a combinatorial chemistry approach was adopted by Levitski et al.11 to convert the PKA-selective inhibitor H-89 (Fig. 1) to the PKB/PKA inhibitor NL-71-101. We anticipated that alternative modifications to the structure of H-89 would reveal other scaffolds capable of generating PKB inhibitors with improved physicochemical properties. In particular, we sought replacements for the potentially metabolically labile alkenyl functionalities of H-89 and NL-71-101, and to reduce the lipophilicities of these ligands (C log P 4.4 and 5.0, respectively). Selectivity for PKB over other AGC kinases was also a consideration, although this was anticipated to be a challenge for PKA since the enzymes have a close sequence ($68%) homology in the kinase domain,18 and within the adenine binding site itself only three residues differ between PKBb and PKAa.19 The availability of the X-ray crystal structure of PKBb20 offered the opportunity to use structurebased design techniques in pursuit of novel inhibitors. Such an approach has been taken previously using a PKA-PKB chimeric protein, to gain insight into the differences between the two enzymes.19 As a result, ATPcompetitive inhibitors with selectivity for PKB over PKA have been developed from templates derived from the natural product balanol, that exploit selectivity features outside the adenine and ribose binding regions.9,10 A structure-based approach, again using balanol derivatives as the starting point, was used to delineate the determinants of selectivity between PKA and PKC.21 The PKB structure has also been used in a virtual screen to identify inhibitors of the enzyme.22 2. PKB modelling and docking studies Compounds were docked into a binding pocket consist° ing of all the protein atoms within a 6 A shell around the AMP­PNP ligand of the available PKB structure20 (PDB 106K). Docking was performed with the program GOLD,23 using the ÔDefault 3Õ Genetic Algorithm settings,24 and docked conformations were scored using the Chemscore scoring function.25 In order to reduce

the number of unacceptable docking solutions, a pharmacophoric restraint was constructed26 based on the available crystal structures of isoquinoline sulfonamides (H-series) complexed with PKA27 (PDB 1YDR, 1YDS and 1YDT). The pharmacophoric restraint contained an acceptor term representing the binding of the isoquinoline nitrogen to the hinge region of the protein, a hydrophobic term centred on the isoquinoline bicycle and a term, composed of two acceptors and one donor, to represent the position of the sulfonamide group. The radius used for individual atoms in the pharmacophore ° was 0.7 A.26 To define the most favourable rotational conformation of the sulfonamide, an extensive search of crystal structures from the PDB and CCDC revealed the conformation observed for H-8 (PDB 1YDS) to be the global minimum, in which one S@O bond lies parallel to the plane of the aromatic group. The alternative arrangement seen for H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)2-methylpiperazine] (PDB 1YDR), in which the sulfonyl group is twisted out of the plane of the aromatic ring, was determined as a local minimum. Once identified, the global minimum conformation was used to select preferred docking solutions and for the design of new molecules. A proprietary virtual screening platform28 was used to generate suggested elaborations of the isoquinoline sulfonamide template. Virtual libraries were constructed from the coupling of isoquinolin-5-yl sulfonyl chloride and commercially available amines, and the libraries were virtually screened using the docking methodology described above with ÔDefault 4Õ Genetic Algorithm settings.24 The selection of compounds for synthesis was made by analysing the binding mode, the conformation, the number of hydrogen bonds formed to key residues of PKB and the value of the scoring function. 3. Synthetic chemistry Direct mono-sulfonylation of ethane-1,2-diamine with freshly prepared isoquinoline-5-sulfonyl chloride 129 gave the sulfonamide 2,29,30 which was further elaborated by reductive amination with 2-benzyloxyacetaldehyde to provide the benzyloxyethyl substitution product 3 (Scheme 1).31 To prepare aryl-substituted analogues 4-13, ethylene glycol was mono-alkylated with the appropriate benzyl halides 14 and the resulting alcohols 15 were oxidised to the aldehydes 16 using Dess­ Martin reagent.32,33 Reductive amination of the crude aldehydes 16 with 2 furnished the analogues 4­13. The unsubstituted analogues 1729 and 18 were prepared straightforwardly by mono-sulfonylation of symmetrical diamines. Various cyclic diamines were also mono-sulfonylated with 1 (Scheme 2). As previously demonstrated,34 the reaction of unprotected 4-aminopiperidine led exclusively to sulfonylation of the primary amine to give 19. Similar regioselectivity was seen in the sulfonylations giving 21,34 2334 and 24.34 The regioisomeric piperidine sulfonamide 20 was prepared from commercially available Boc-protected 4-aminopiperidine followed by deprotection. The unambiguous synthesis of 20

Sulfonylation was followed by sulfonamide protection with the SEM group,37 to permit selective O-benzylation of the alcohols 36 and 37 later in the sequence. Acidic deprotection of the N-SEM and N-Boc-protecting groups was carried out in a single step to yield 40 and 41.

confirmed the regiochemistry of the sulfonylation leading to 19. The trans-cyclohexyl-1,4-diamine analogue 22 was also synthesised from the mono-Boc-protected diamine since attempted mono-sulfonylation of the unprotected diamine gave an intractable mixture of products. The most efficient route for elaboration of the analogue 22 was found to be reductive amination of benzaldehyde with the mono-Boc diamine, followed by deprotection and sulfonylation to give 25 (Scheme 3). The preparation of the 3-substituted piperazine 29 required a new approach from the known N-benzyl-protected piperazine ester 26.35 Sulfonylation of 26 and complete reduction of the ester 27 were followed by alkylation of the alcohol to give 28. Selective removal of the N-benzylprotecting group of 28 in the presence of the 4-chlorobenzyloxy substituent was achieved through N-activation using chloroethyl chloroformate.36 Single diastereoisomer, substituted aminopyrrolidines related to 23 were prepared separately from commercialScheme 4.

For substituted analogues of the aminomethylpyrrolidine 24, the single diastereoisomer hydroxyproline esters38 42 and 43 were separately O-alkylated and reduced to the alcohols 44 and 45, respectively (Scheme 5). The alcohols were activated as the mesylates and displaced with sodium azide to give the azides 46 and 47. Hydrogenation of 46, sulfonylation and deprotection were carried out without isolation of intermediates to give the analogue 48. When this sequence was performed on the azide 47, however, some reduction of the 4-chlorobenzyl substituent was seen in the hydrogenation step. The mixture of 4-chloro and des-chloro compounds was carried through the sulfonylation and deprotection, and was separated by preparative HPLC to give compounds 49 and 50. To prepare a related 2,5-syn-pyrrolidine 55, the known racemic bicyclic amide 5139 was doubly protected with the N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (Scheme 6). On treatment of 52 with sodium hydroxide, the activated bicyclic amide was ring-opened to generate the racemic 2,5-syn-substituted pyrrolidine scaffold.39 Without isolation, the liberated carboxylic acid was reduced with sodium borohydride to the alcohol 53, which was alkylated on oxygen to give 54. Complete N-deprotection of 54 gave a diamine that was sulfonylated selectively on the primary amine to yield the required analogue 55. To allow the investigation of replacements of the parent isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide in the analogue 41, the relevant single diastereoisomer diamine side-chain 59 was made (Scheme 7). The protected proline derivative 56 was prepared from (2S,4R)-4-hydroxyproline following literature procedures.40 Alkylation of 56 was followed by selective O-deprotection using mild acid. The secondary alcohol 58 was activated as the mesylate and displaced, with inversion, by sodium azide.41 Reduction of the intermediate azide gave

the desired amine 59, which was subsequently coupled to 4-methylisoquinoline-5-sulfonyl chloride42 and deprotected to give 61. Sulfonylation of 59 with 1chloroisoquinoline-5-sulfonyl chloride43 and sulfonamide N­H protection with the SEM group gave the sulfonamide 63. Displacement of the iminoyl chloride from 63 through SNAr reaction with potassium trimethylsilanolate44 and acidic deprotection of the pyrrolidine and sulfonamide led to the 1-hydroxyisoquinoline analogue 65.

4. PKA--ligand co-crystallography As part of the structure-based design approach, the cocrystal structures of selected inhibitors with PKA were determined. The a catalytic subunit of bovine PKA was expressed and purified with reference to previously described protocols.27,45 Hanging drops containing 17 mg/ml of tri-phospho PKA, 25 mM Mes­BisTris, pH 6.5, 75 mM LiCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1.5 mM octanoyl-N-methylglucamide and 1 mM PKI(5­24) were equilibrated at 4 °C against 15% (v/v) methanol. Crystals of apo PKA appeared overnight and were soaked for approximately 18 h at 4 °C in a solution containing 10% PEG 400, 25 mM Mes­BisTris, pH 6.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM of inhibitor. The crystals were briefly immersed in a cryoprotectant containing 22.5% MPD, 25 mM Mes­BisTris, pH 6.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT, before plunge-freezing into liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a RigakuMSC Jupiter CCD mounted on an RU-H3R rotating anode generator. Data were integrated using MOSFLM46 before input into a proprietary procedure for automated scaling, refinement and ligand fitting.47 The starting model used for refinement was the previously solved PKA structure PDB 1YDS,48 with ligand and waters removed. After ligand fitting, subsequent cycles of model adjustment and refinement were carried out using QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.) and REFMAC5.49 Data processing and refinement statistics are given in the Supplementary Material. 5. Results and discussion Following the observation that the benzhydryl group of NL-71-101 imparted a degree of selectivity for inhibition of PKB over PKA,11 we initially attempted to prepare benzhydryl and close derivatives where the isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide was replaced by various aromatic and heteroaromatic groups linked through an amide. However, this generally led to compounds with poor solubility that confounded accurate testing in vitro (data not shown). We sought to improve the solubility of the ligands by restricting the terminal substituent to a single aromatic group, as in H-89, while incorporating a polar heteroatom into the linker. As well as potentially improving the physicochemical properties, this strategy also addressed the replacement of the potential metabolic site of the alkene in the linker. Thus, a novel series of 2-benzyloxyethyl-substituted analogues 3­13 were prepared16 (Table 1). The parent phenyl analogue 3 showed good in vitro PKB inhibitory activity in the radiometric enzyme inhibition assay50 but no activity in the SRB (sulforhodamine B) cellular antiproliferation assay.51 The effects of simple aromatic substitution were examined and, in general, lipophilic electron-withdrawing or neutral substituents were optimal, a structure­activity relationship that parallels previous observations with analogues leading to NL-71-101.11 Methyl substitution, as in compounds

4­6, was tolerated at all positions, and the most active 2-methyl isomer 4 now showed measurable activity in cells. Chloro substitution, as in compounds 7­9, was beneficial for both in vitro PKB inhibition and cellular antiproliferative activity. In contrast, electron-donating methoxy substituents 11­13 were not advantageous. The selectivity of the more active compounds 7­9 against PKA and PKCa was measured (Table 3). The compounds were 10- to 20-fold selective against PKCa, but showed equipotent inhibition of PKA. This compares with the 8-fold selectivity for PKA shown by H89, the change from the rigid all-carbon 3-atom linker to the more polar, and more flexible, 4-atom linker having overturned this. Although the 4-chlorophenyl analogue 9 had sufficient potency to permit further investigations in cellular assays (vide infra), improvements in the activity and selectivity of the ligands were sought. The large number of rotatable bonds (nRot = 10) in these structures was considered undesirable, since inverse correlations of flexibility and membrane permeability have been reported,52­54 and this feature might account in part for the low cellular activity of the compounds relative to their in vitro enzyme inhibition. In addition, conformational restriction of linear chains can lead to increased potency by lowering the entropic penalty on binding and may also provide a potential means of increasing ligand selectivity.55 To be successful in this series of compounds,

conformational restriction of the diamine linker must optimally deliver the terminal lipophilic aryl group, whilst not disrupting the important hydrogen-bonding interaction of the central amine. There is evidence from X-ray structural determinations of isoquinoline ligands bound to PKA that this interaction has some flexibility,27 and it is reasonable to expect that PKB might exhibit similar tolerance in the positioning of the amine. Simple cyclic diamines were introduced onto the isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide in an attempt to find conformationally restricted scaffolds of equal, or better, potency than the parent ethylenediamine (H-8) or the propylenediamine homologue 17 (Table 1). Virtual docking studies were undertaken to further select replacements for the linear diamines, and additionally to determine the positions on the cyclic diamine scaffolds from which elaboration with a 4-chlorobenzyloxy group, or similar, would be most likely to allow occupation of appropriate space in the enzyme. Of the unsubstituted analogues prepared, the 4-aminopiperidine 19, trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane 22 and 3aminopyrrolidine 23 showed activity equivalent to the linear scaffolds of H-8 and 17 (Table 1). There was some divergence between the observed activity of the unsubstituted diamines, and the scaffolds predicted by modelling to be more promising for substituent addition. For example, although the parent amine had good activity against PKB, substitution of the trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane 22 from the distal amine was predicted to occur along unfavourable vectors for reaching the lipophilic binding pocket. A similar problem was anticipated for the 4-aminopiperidine 20. For the piperizine 18 and 4aminopiperidine 19, an apparent need to preserve a free N­H for optimum hydrogen bonding to the enzyme in the docking studies suggested that substitution from the a-carbon would be more productive. In contrast, the 2-(S)-aminomethylpyrrolidine 24, although of relatively low activity, was predicted to be a competent scaffold for delivering the terminal lipophilic group when appropriately substituted. 3-Aminopyrrolidine was identified as a highly suitable scaffold, both from the modelling and the observation of the inhibitory activity of compound 23. For the pyrrolidine templates, accurate prediction of the best relative stereochemistry of substitution was difficult, and both cis and trans-substitution patterns were considered for synthesis. Although in general no distinct preference for the absolute stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine fragments was discernible from the modelling, for the aminomethylpyrrolidine 24 the 2-(S) enantiomer gave consistently better docking predictions for both the parent and elaborated derivatives. Only the (S)-enantiomer of 24 was synthesised and tested. For the selected scaffolds, addition of appropriately linked 4-chlorophenyl groups was made (Table 2). As anticipated from the modelling studies, N-substitution of the trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane 22 to give compound 25 did not improve the activity. Substitution a to nitrogen of the piperazine 18 was investigated to give compound 29. The marginal increase in activity observed was not encouraging for pursuing this substitu-

tion pattern on this scaffold, or on the more synthetically demanding 4-aminopiperidine 19. Instead, attention was focussed on the pyrrolidines 23 and 24. For the 3-aminopyrrolidine constraint, PKB docking studies and comparison to the structure of H-89 docked to PKA (PDB code 1YDT) indicated that the 5-position would provide the best vector for further substitution (Fig. 2). The calculated free energy difference between cis and trans isomers using the Chemscore scoring function was <0.5 kcal molÀ1, too low to allow any prediction to be drawn. In the event, substitution at this position was favourable for the (2S,4S) diastereomer 41, which proved significantly more active than either the unsubstituted parent 23 or the (2S,4R) isomer 40. For the (S)-2-aminomethylpyrrolidine constraint 24, docking indicated the 4-position as suitable for substitution (Fig. 3). Alternative orientations of the pyrrolidine ring were identified that suggested a (2R,5R) substitution pattern could also be accommodated, provided adjustments were made in the length of the linker at the 5-position. Some indication of preferred relative stereochemistry was obtained from the modelling of the 4-substituted compounds, in favour of the (S,S) diastereomer 50 over the (2S,4R) diastereisomer 48 (Chemscore DDG 4.8 kcal molÀ1). This observation was not used in a proscriptive sense, however, and both isomers were prepared. In practice, a large improvement in activity over the unsubsituted parent 24 was observed upon attachment of the side chain at either the 4-position of the (S)-2-aminomethylpyrrolidine, 48­50, or at the 5-position in the alternative enantiomeric series 55. For the 4-substituted compounds, the (2S,4S) isomer 50 showed 3.5-fold more potent enzyme inhibition than the (2S,4R) isomer 48. The importance of the lipophilic chlorine substituent for high activity, as observed in the linear diamines (cf. 9 vs 3), was emphasised by the 7-fold drop in activity between 50 and the des-chloro analogue 49. Inhibition of cell growth was investigated for the more active pyrrolidine derivatives. Arguably, a limited general improvement in cellular penetration was achieved through the reduction in the number of rotatable bonds in these analogues (nRot = 7­8), since compounds with biochemical activities of 1­5 lM (40, 41, 48, 50, and 55) showed measurable cellular activity. This contrasts with the ethylenediamine analogues 3­ 13 (Table 1), where biochemical activity below 1 lM was apparently necessary before measurable cellular activity was achieved. A caveat to this interpretation is that the cellular assay is not necessarily a simple integration of PKB/PKA activity and membrane permeability, and could reflect any other activities of the compounds. The selectivities of selected constrained analogues versus PKA and/or PKCa were determined (Table 3). In general, no significant selectivity was seen between PKB and PKA activities regardless of the presence or absence of the lipophilic side chain. In contrast, selectivity (ca. 10- to 100-fold) was observed for PKB/PKA versus PKCa for the fully elaborated pyrrolidines 41 and 50. In these respects, constraint of

the diamine linker did not provide a biochemical advantage over the linear scaffolds, for which similar selectivity profiles were observed. For one of the most active pyrrolidines 41, a limited study of conservative changes to the isoquinoline group was made, inspired by the known structure­activity relationships of isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide inhibitors of rho-kinase56 (Table 2). Methylation of the rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil at C-4 of the isoquinoline has been shown to increase the affinity of the analogue for rho-kinase, while leaving PKA activity unchanged. For the compound 61, introduction of the C-4 methyl group was detrimental to PKB activity, while PKA activity was unaffected, leading to 8-fold selectivity for PKA over PKB (Table 3). The metabolism of fasudil by

oxidation at C-1 of the isoquinoline is known to lead to a more potent in vivo inhibitor of the rho-kinase enzyme.57 However, the 1-hydroxyisoquinoline analogue 65 showed equivalent activity against PKB to the parent 41. No significant selectivity was observed for PKB or PKA with compound 65. The binding mode of selected ligands (9 and 48) was evaluated crystallographically with PKA. PKA provides a useful surrogate for PKB as the active sites are approximately 80% identical,18,19 and PKA is a robust crystallographic system amenable to high-throughput data collection. Given the general equipotency of this series of compounds for PKB and PKA, a correspondence between the binding modes to the two proteins would be expected. The constrained ligands 41, 48 and

50 showed equivalent inhibition of PKA activity to the linear inhibitor 9 (Table 3). The co-crystal structure of 9 bound to PKA (PDB 2C1A) reveals an overall ligand orientation as expected from previous crystallographic studies with isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide ligands27,58 (Fig. 4). The isoquinoline binds in the adenine site of the ATP cleft, sandwiched

between the hydrophobic side chains of Val57 and Leu173, and forming a single hydrogen bond between its heteroaromatic nitrogen and the backbone amide of Val123 on the kinase hinge. A ÔCHOÕ type interaction between the isoquinoline C-1 hydrogen and the backbone carbonyl of Glu121 is also observed, and the fused phenyl ring of the heterocycle is orientated towards the ÔgatekeeperÕ Met120. No close protein contacts are observed with the sulfonamide group of the ligand, which adopts a rotational conformation placing the S­N bond orthogonal to the plane of the aromatic ring. The flexible, 7-atom chain between the sulfonamide and the terminal aromatic ring adopts a pronounced Ushaped fold which is similar to that observed for H-89 complexed with PKA.27 The protonated nitrogen occupies the PKA ribose binding site and is involved in salt-bridging and hydrogen-bonding interactions with

1263

the carboxylate of Asp184 and the side-chain carboxamide of Asn171. The other potential salt-bridging partner in this region of the protein, Glu127, does not participate in direct interactions to the ligand. The ligandÕs terminal 4-chlorophenyl ring is directed towards the glycine-rich loop and occupies a hydrophobic pocket defined primarily by the side chains of Thr51, Val53, Lys72, Leu74 and the backbone carbonyls of Gly52 and Gly55. The structure of PKA with the pyrrolidine ligand 48 (PDB 2C1B) allows a comparison with the linear compound 9 and shows that the isoquinoline sulfonamide moieties adopt identical positions and conformations within the adenine site and form essentially equivalent interactions with the hinge (Fig. 5). Likewise, the terminal 4-chlorophenyl groups occupy very similar regions of space, although there are subtle differences in the exact positioning and orientation of the chlorophenyl due to additional constraints on the cyclised ligand. The largest difference, however, is observed for the pyrrolidine linker, the basic amine being displaced by ca. ° 2.4 A, relative to the position in the unconstrained molecule, and having a significant effect on the binding interactions of this functional group (Fig. 6). The salt bridge between the basic group and Asp184 is lost and is replaced by an interaction with Glu127. Asp184, which has been observed to be flexible in other structures, now adopts an alternative rotamer in which it forms a salt bridge with the basic amine of Lys72. In addition, a water mediated hydrogen bond is formed between the basic pyrrolidine amine and the phenol of Tyr330. The positions of other residues in the ATP-site of PKA for both inhibitor complexes are essentially equivalent. Thus, although the constrained pyrrolidine 48 is a very effective mimic of the overall fold of the linear molecule 9, there is a change in the detailed binding mode between the two inhibitors. This may reflect the presence of multiple potential binding sites (principally Asp184 and Glu127) for a basic group within the ribose binding

region of the PKA (and by homology, PKB) kinase domain. The redundancy of potential interactions to the basic amine and flexibility of the protein in this region would imply that the other constrained inhibitors 40, 41, 49, 50 and 55 may adopt slightly different contacts to the protein, whilst maintaining a high degree of overall conformational similarity. These changes in detailed binding mode, and the associated small changes in protein conformation and water structure, may make the effects of ligand conformational restriction on binding affinity harder to predict exactly. A comparison of the co-crystal structure of 48 and PKA with the structure predicted from docking of 48 to PKB (PDB Code 1O6K) (Fig. 7) shows that there is a good correspondence in the overall conformation of the ligand. The glycine-rich loop of PKB is displaced by ca. ° 1 A relative to its position in PKA, and this is reflected

by a shift in position of the 4-chlorophenyl ring by a similar amount. This loop is known to be a highly flexible region of kinases and can adopt a variety of conformations depending upon the ligand bound and the protein crystal system.59,60 The contacts and positions of the isoquinoline ring are identical in the PKB model and the PKA determined structure. The model also correctly predicts the interaction of the basic amine of the ligand 48 with Glu127 rather than Asp184. Although suitable conformational constraints of the linear inhibitor 9 were identified by modelling, and shown by ligand­protein co-crystallography to adopt favourable binding conformations, no improvement in the in vitro inhibition of PKB was seen. The expected entropic gain in affinity through rotatable bond restriction is difficult to quantify, but has been estimated to be approximately 2- to 3-fold/rotor.61 For these compounds, it is possible that any relatively small affinity gain achieved by constraining the molecule is offset by less favourable protein­ligand interactions in the new complex. Although Glu127 and Asp184 may be equivalent sites for binding to ligand basic groups, predicting the precise energetic consequences associated with changing these interactions is difficult, particularly when protein movements and changes in hydration are involved. In addition, it should be noted that the subtle changes in the presentation of the chlorophenyl group to the hydrophobic pocket in the glycine loop may affect the free-energy of binding. The constrained analogues offered no advantage in selectivity for PKB versus PKA, although it was noted that PKB/PKA selectivity did show some response to changes in the spacer between the basic amine and terminal lipophilic group (cf. H-89 vs 9, 41). Recent studies have shown that high selectivity for PKB versus PKA can be achieved when ATP-competitive inhibitors access a region of the enzyme beyond the glycine-rich loop.9,10 Significant structural extension of the inhibitors described here might be needed to occupy similar sites in the enzyme, and although the current compounds fall within the accepted ranges of Ôdrug-likeÕ physicochemical properties62 (e.g., 9 MW 420, Clog P 4.0; 41 MW 432, Clog P 3.9), significant additional functionality might lead to a less favourable physicochemical profile. The effects of the inhibitors 9 and 41 on the PI3K-PKB pathway in cells were studied in more detail. In particular, the ability of the inhibitors to block GSK3b phosphorylation on Ser9 by PKB was examined by Western blotting in PC-3 cells (Fig. 8). This cell line is expected to show increased signalling activity through PI3K-PKB due to the deletion of the negative regulator PTEN.5,63 At concentrations equivalent to or greater than the IC50 for cell growth inhibition, both compounds showed inhibition of GSK3b phosphorylation, indicating that the compounds inhibit PKB kinase activity towards cells. No effects on total levels of GSK3b or PKB protein were observed. Additionally, 9 and 41 were assayed for their ability to inhibit PDK1 kinase activity in vitro, and found to have no activity at concentrations up to 30 lM.64 Quantification of the cellular effects of

the inhibitors was achieved using a Ser9 GSK3b cellular ELISA protocol to measure the extent of GSK3b phosphorylation in PC-3 cells.65 The inhibitors 9 and 41 inhibited Ser9 GSK3b phosphorylation in cells with IC50 values of 15 and 17 lM, respectively, consistent with both the Western blot data, and their cell growth inhibition in the SRB assay. Since ligands from the isoquinolinesulfonamide class have been shown to be ATP-competitive inhibitors of a range of kinases, particularly serine/threonine kinases,11,66 the correlation of PKB enzyme inhibition with antiproliferative effects on cells would be enhanced by further kinase counterscreening data.67 6. Conclusions A series of isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide inhibitors of PKB was developed, with sub-micromolar activity and structurally distinct from previous ligands in this class. Structure-based design using the PKB crystal structure was successful in guiding the preparation of constrained analogues that mimic the bound conformation of the linear prototypes, which was confirmed by co-crystal structure determinations using PKA. Detailed variation in the binding mode between inhibitors with very similar overall conformations was observed. Although effective in this manner, the conformational constraints did not significantly change the in vitro activity of the compounds. Selectivity for in vitro inhibition of PKB over PDK1 and PKCa was observed in this series of ligands, while the compounds were equipotent at PKA. In cellular assays, the most potent inhibitors in this series showed the characteristic inhibition of GSK3b phosphorylation expected for PKB inhibitors. These molecules should prove useful tools for further exploration of the biological effects of inhibition of PKB. 7. Experimental 7.1. PKB in vitro enzyme assay Recombinant, purified PKBb enzyme was provided by Professor David Barford, Structural Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Labs, Fulham Road. Calbiochem, Merck Biosciences, UK, supplied the peptide substrate, AKTide-2T (ARKRERTYSFGHHA), and assays were run in polypropylene 96-well plates. Assay volume was 25 lL, with a

buffer consisting of 20 mM Mops, pH 7.2, 25 mM bglycerophosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 15 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. The final peptide concentration was 25 lM, with 30 lM ATP and 0.35 lCi [33P-c]ATP. In the enzyme reaction, the 33P-c-labelled phosphate from ATP was transferred to the serine residue of the peptide. Incubations were stopped with 30 lL of 2% orthophosphoric acid. The reaction mixture was transferred to a phosphocellulose filter plate (MAPHNOB from Millipore, UK), where the labelled peptide binds, and the unused ATP was washed away with 0.5% orthophosphoric acid. The filter plate was dried, scintillant was added to the wells and the incorporated activity was measured on a TopCountTM (Perkin-Elmer). Under these conditions, enzyme activity was linear with time (up to 30 min) and enzyme concentration (up to 1.5 nM). Compounds were diluted in 12.5% DMSO and added to the assay such that the final DMSO concentration was 2.5%. Inhibitor IC50 values were determined from an eight-point concentration range run in duplicate and calculated in GraphPad Prism 4.00. The standard H-89 gave IC50 0.59 (±0.07) lM under these conditions (lit. value11 IC50 2.5 lM, assay [ATP] 10 lM). 7.2. General synthetic chemistry experimental Reaction was carried out under N2. Organic solutions were dried over MgSO4 or Na2SO4. Starting materials and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. Flash silica chromatography was performed using Merck silica gel 60 (0.025­0.04 mm). Ion exchange chromatography was performed using Isolute Flash SCX-II (acidic) or Flash NH2 (basic) resin cartridges. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC250 instrument and chemical shifts (d) are reported relative to TMS and/ or referenced to the solvent in which they were measured. Combined HPLC­MS analyses were recorded using a Waters Alliance 2795 Separations Module and Waters/Micromass LCT mass detector with electrospray ionisation (+ve or Àve ion mode as indicated). Analytical HPLC was performed using a Supelco DISCOVERY C18 5 cm · 4.6 mm i.d., 5 lm column, with a gradient elution of 10­90% MeOH/0.1% aqueous formic acid at a flow rate of 1 mL minÀ1 and a running time of 10 min. Compounds were detected at 254 nm using a Waters 2487 Dual k Absorbance Detector. High resolution mass spectra were measured at the Department of Chemistry, Cambridge University, UK, on a Bruker Bio Apex II 4.7e FTICR instrument, or a Waters LCT Premier ESI-ToF instrument, and are within ±5 ppm. Synthetic intermediates were characterised by 1H NMR spectra and MS (where electrospray ionisation permitted observation of a relevant ion) for identity and were assessed by 1H NMR for homogeneity. Compounds for biological testing were additionally characterised by HRMS for identity and were assessed by HPLC (UV detection) for homogeneity. Compounds 211,29,30 and 1729 were prepared according to the literature procedures.

Ethylene glycol (1.67 mL, 30 mmol) was added over 10 min to a slurry of NaH (60% dispersion in oil, 0.246 g, 10.3 mmol) and dry THF (15 mL) at rt. The mixture was warmed to 50 °C, and a solution of 4-chlorobenzyl bromide (2.0 g, 9.8 mmol) in dry THF (10 mL) was added during 45 min. The mixture was refluxed for 18 h, cooled to rt and partitioned between Et2O (20 mL) and water (20 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine, dried, filtered and concentrated. Flash silica chromatography (10% MeOH­CH2Cl2) gave the alcohol 15 (R = 4Cl) as a pale yellow oil (1.5 g, 8.0 mmol, 82%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 250 MHz) d 2.02 (1H, br s), 3.60­3.63 (2H, m), 3.77­3.80 (2H, m), 4.55 (2H, s), 7.31 (2H, dd, J = 6, 3 Hz), 7.35 (2H, dd, J = 6, 3 Hz). Dess­Martin periodinane (0.670 g, 1.60 mmol) was added in one portion to a solution of 15 (R = 4-Cl) (0.273 g, 1.46 mmol) in wet CH2Cl2 (15 mL). After stirring at rt for 2 h, the mixture was diluted with saturated aq NaHCO3 and sodium thiosulfate (50 mL). After the disappearance of the precipitate (10 min), the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 and the organic phase was washed with brine, dried and concentrated to give the aldehyde 16 (R = 4-Cl) as a colourless oil (0.253 g, 1.38 mmol, 94%) that was used without further purification. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 250 MHz) d 4.14 (2H, s), 4.62 (2H, s), 7.28­7.39 (4H, m), 9.75 (1H, s).

The reaction mixture was stirred for 20 min followed by addition of NaB(OAc)3H (0.259 g, 1.18 mmol) in one portion and then AcOH (10 drops). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt until the reactants were consumed as determined by the TLC analysis. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated aq NaHCO3 and filtered through a layer of Celite. The product was extracted with EtOAc, and the combined organic extracts were dried and concentrated.

Flash silica chromatography (30% EtOAc­hexane) gave (2S,4S)-2-(4-chlorobenzyloxymethyl)-4-[(1-chloroisoquinoline-5-sulfonyl)-(2-trimethylsilanyleth-oxymethyl)amino]-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (63) (0.44 g, quantitative). 1H NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3) d 0.00 (9H, s), 0.82 (2H, t, J = 8 Hz), 1.44 (9H, s), 2.05­2.30 (2H, m), 3.20 (1H, dd, J = 10.4, 10.6 Hz), 3.40­4.00 (5H, m), 4.16 (1H, m), 4.48 (2H, s), 4.93 (1H, d, J = 11 Hz), 4.99 (1H, d, J = 11 Hz), 7.24 (2H, d, J = 8 Hz), 7.34 (2H, d, J = 8 Hz), 7.81 (1H, dd, J = 8, 7.5 Hz), 8.42 (1H, d, J = 6 Hz), 8.43 (1H, d, J = 6 Hz), 8.53 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz), 8.70 (1H, d, J = 8 Hz). MS (ESI) m/z 718 [(M+Na)+]. KOSiMe3 (0.16 g, 1.3 mmol) was added to a solution of 63 (0.102 g, 0.146 mmol) in THF (2 mL). The solution was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h, then cooled to rt and partitioned between CH2Cl2 (25 mL) and saturated aq NH4Cl (250 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 · 25 mL) and the combined organic extracts were dried and concentrated. Flash silica chromatography (50­100% EtOAc­hexane) gave (2S,4S)-2-(4-chlorobenzyloxymethyl)-4-[(1-hydroxyisoquinoline-5-sulfonyl)-(2-trimethylsilanylethoxymethyl)amino]-pyrrolidine1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (64) (62 mg, 0.092 mmol, 63%). 1H NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3) d 0.00 (9H, s), 0.85 (2H, t, J = 8 Hz), 1.42 (9H, s), 2.04­2.35 (1H, m), 3.21 (1H, t, J = 11 Hz), 3.40­3.95 (6H, m), 4.47 (2H, s), 4.90 (1H, d, J = 11 Hz), 4.96 (1H, d, J = 11 Hz), 7.20­7.35 (6H, m), 7.60 (1H, t, J = 8 Hz), 8.39 (1H, dd, J = 1, 8 Hz), 8.70 (1H, dd, J = 1, 8 Hz), 11.32 (1H, br s). MS (ESI) m/z 700 [(M+Na)+]. HCl (1 mL, 4 M solution in dioxane) was added to a solution of 64 (65 mg, 0.096 mmol) in MeOH (1 mL). The solution was stirred at rt for 24 h and then diluted with Et2O (10 mL). The supernatant was decanted and the solid was washed with Et2O (10 mL). The solid was purified by ion exchange on acidic resin (MeOH, then 0.5 M NH3 in MeOH). Flash silica chromatography (12.5% MeOH­CH2Cl2) gave 65 (10 mg, 0.022 mmol, 24%). 1H NMR (250 MHz, CD3OD) d 1.21 (1H, ddd, J = 8, 8, 13 Hz), 1.87 (1H, ddd, J = 8, 8, 13 Hz), 2.53 (1H, dd, J = 6, 11 Hz), 2.77 (1H, dd, J = 7, 11 Hz), 3.21 (1H, m), 3.31 (1H, dd, J = 2, 5 Hz), 3.60 (1H, m), 4.36 (2H, s), 7.15­7.27 (6H, m), 7.54 (1H, dd, J = 8, 8 Hz), 8.23 (1H, dd, J = 1, 8 Hz), 8.49 (1H, dd, J = 1, 8 Hz).
