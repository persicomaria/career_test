Introduction Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12; G A P D H ) catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of o-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and is found in both glycolytic and gluconeogenic metabolic pathways. The reaction mechanism of the bacterial and eukaryotic enzyme has been studied in great detail and proceeds through a thioester-acyl enzyme intermediate with a cysteine amino acid in the enzyme active site. 1 Most G A P D H s known to date are homotetramers with a subunit molecular mass around 37 kDa. Bacterial and eukaryotic GAPDHs show high sequence similarity (over 40% identity) and usually utilize the cofactor NAD +, with the exception of some plant chloroplast GAPDHs, which are NADP ÷ specific.2 G A P D H from the archaea differs from its bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts in low overall sequence identity (16-20%) and dual cofactor specificity (both NADP + and NAD+). Primary structures of G A P D H s are known for the thermophilic archaea Methanothermus fervidus, 3 Pyrococcus woesei, 4 Sulfolobus solfataricus, 5'~ Methanococcus jannaschiL 7 Archaeoglobus fulgidus, 8 and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum 9 and for two mesophilic archaeal species, Methanobacteriurn formicicum and Methanobacterium bryantii. 1oThe S. solfataricus enzyme has relatively high sequence identity (45-50%) to other archaeal GAPDHs. 6 The low sequence similarity between archaeal GAPDHs and

enzymes from the two other kingdoms, as well as the difficulty in aligning residues implicated in the catalytic mechanism, have led to the suggestion that archaeal G A P D H s are unrelated to their bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts and show a convergent molecular evolution in the catalytic region of their structure. 11 Crystal structures have been reported for GAPDHs from a number of eukaryotes and bacteria, including human, 12 psychrophilic lobsters Homarus americanus 1 and Palinurus versicolor, 13 Trypanosoma brucei, 14
Trypanosoma cruzi, a5 Leishmania mexicana, 16 Escherichia coli, 17 Bacillus coagulans, TM the moderate thermophile Bacillus stearothermophilus, 19 the thermophile Thermus aquaticus, 2° and the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. 21 All of these enzymes are tetramers and have very similar structures. Each subunit is built up from two al/3 domains; the N-terminal

nucleotide-binding domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain. The latter is built around an eight-stranded/3 sheet of mixed type and contains a Cys residue. This nucleophile reacts with the aldehyde portion of the substrate, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. 1 The abortive ternary complex of H. americanus G A P D H with 3,3,3-trifluoroacetone suggests that His-176 in the Cterminal domain acts as a base extracting a proton from Cys-149 during catalysis. 22The binding sites of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and of the substrate phosphate (Ps) were first identified in the crystal structure of H. americanus GAPDH. 23

Sulfolobus solfataricus GAPDH Gene Cloning and Expression
The gene coding for the S. solfataricus G A P D H enzyme has been cloned and expressed in E. coliJ The gap gene overlaps by 8 bp the gene coding for another glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers 5' CCG G A A TTC GAC/T GCI TTC/T GC/GI A/G CI GCA/C/G/T CA 3' sense and 5' CCG G G A ATT CTC G / A A A IAC ICC IG/AC IGG T/C/G/ACC G/ATT 3' antisense (where I represents inosine) were based on highly conserved regions of the many different PGK sequences (over 40) available. The first primer was based on the conserved region involved in 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate binding (amino acids 163-167 of the yeast PGK sequence) and the second primer was based on the ATP-binding site (amino acids 334-338 in the yeast PGK sequence). These are used to screen a genomic library of S. solfataricus DNA to first isolate the full-length pgk gene. This yields a 2.5-kb BglII fragment, which contains the gap gene immediately downstream of the pgk gene. Unexpectedly the initiation codon of the gap gene, GTG, precedes the termination codon of the pgk gene (Fig. 1). A conservation of DNA is usually reserved for viral genomes. An overlap of five nucleotides between the RNA-dependent R N A polymerase of S. solfataricus has also been described} 4 The genes encoding PGK and G A P D H are adjacent in other thermophilic bacterial genomes; however, their order is usually reversed with gap preceding pgk. In bacterial genomes the number of base pairs between the genes decreases with increasing growth temperature from E. coli 25to B. stearothermophilus 26to Thermus thermophilus ~7and Thermotoga

maritima 28 species. The G-C content of the gap gene in S. solfataricus is 38%. A polypyrimidine (T-rich) region is located downstream of the gap gene, which is typical of the transcriptional termination sequences of the archaea. 29 The gap gene also has a strong bias toward A + T in the third nucleotide of each codon, particularly for leucine, isoleucine, alanine, and threonine, which is a feature observed in other genes of thermophilic archa e a . 3°'31 This is in contrast to the genes of some of thermophilic bacteria such as Thermus species, where a G or C in the third codon position is favored, z7 Northern blot analysis shows that the p g k and gap genes are cotranscribed in S. solfataricus. 5 This was one of the first demonstrations that operons are present in archaea. The overlap between the two genes means that a frame shift must take place when the single transcript is translated. To obtain recombinant GAPDH, the gap gene is cloned into the E. coli T7 expression vector pET3d. 32 PCR primers are designed based on the gap gene sequence (5' GGT G A A TAG CCA TGG T-FA AAT GTA GCT GTT AAC GGT 3' and 5' TFA CAA AAT ACC ATG G T r CAC TCA TAT TAG ATA CCC CT 3'), which includes converting the GTG initiation codon to ATG. The unusual GTG initiation codon has been encountered in other archaeal genes, such as aspartate aminotransferase from S. solfataricus and G A P D H from P. woesei. 3°'33 All of the primers have a NcoI site incorporated for cloning purposes. The PCR products are digested with NcoI, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and purified using the Gene Clean kit (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, California) before being cloned into the E. coli expression vector pETd. 32 The introduction of the NcoI at the initiation codon site of the gap gene required the change of the second codon from ATT to GT-17, which results in a conservative change from the amino acid isoleucine to valine in the recombinant protein. Plasmids containing the gap gene in the correct orientation are transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). To express the GAPDH protein the cells are grown in M9 medium containing ampicillin (50 /zg/ml) until the A600 m e a s u r e s 0.6 and are then induced by the addition of isopropylthio-fl-D-galactoside (0.4 mM) and

G A P D H Assay
The assay is performed at 50° and the reaction mixture contains 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8, 10 mM NAD +, 10 mM potassium arsenate, and GAPDH enzyme. The reaction is started by the addition of the substrate DL-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and is monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Enzyme activity of 1 U is defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1/xmol product/min at 50°. The S. solfataricus GAPDH utilizes both NAD + and NADP + as cofactors. The apparent Km values for NAD ÷ and NADP + are 2.2 +_ 0.5 mm and 67 _+ 29/xM with Vmax values of 2.3 _+ 1.3 and 2.3 _+ 1.7 U/mg, respectively, when assayed at 50°.

Protein Purification The harvested E. coli cells harboring the plasmid containing the gap gene are resuspended in buffer A containing 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and the protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 0.05 mM) and benzamidine hydrochloride (0.1 mM). The suspension is sonicated to break the cells and clarified by centrifugation. Nucleic acids are precipitated by treating the crude extract with 0.1% protamine sulfate at 4° for 1.5 hr and centrifuging for 30 rain at 20,000 rpm at 4°. The resulting supernatant is heated at 80° for 15 min to precipitate most of the E. coli proteins (Table I). After centrifugation the supernatant is applied to a dye ligand affinity column

(2.5 × 30 cm) of Reactive Red 120 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The G A P D H is eluted by application of 1.0 M NaCI in buffer A. Protein to be used for crystallization studies is purified further by gel-filtration chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) to increase its purity to better than 99% and to remove any nonspecific aggregation. Properties of Recombinant GAPDH The pure protein has a Mr of approximately 40,000 as judged by SDSPAGE, which agrees with the predicted molecular weight of 37,581. For analysis by laser desorption mass spectrophotometry the purified G A P D H is concentrated to 100 ~g/ml and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol. This gave a Mr of 37,611 + 0.1%. Sedimentation analysis of the G A P D H at concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mg/ml gives a molecular weight of 148,330 + 830.8 indicating a tetramer. The recombinant G A P D H protein elutes as a tetramer by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (5 × 30 cm) eluted with buffer A. This is in common with other G A P D H s from other species. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 15 residues of the recombinant G A P D H agrees with the deduced amino acid sequence from the gene construct. The thermostability of recombination G A P D H is measured by heating samples of the enzyme at 50 mg/ml in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in sealed tubes at 80° for different times and then placing on ice before assaying under standard conditions at 50°. The half-life of the activity of the recombinant enzyme under these conditions is 17 hr. Crystallization The G A P D H protein is crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique as described. 35 The protein concentration is 10 mg/ml in the initial droplet in the presence of 10 mM PIPES, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM N A D +. The precipitant is 35% (NH4)2SOt and crystallization is at 17°. The crystals are harvested into mother liquor containing 45% saturated ammonium sulfate, 10 mM PIPES, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM NAD +. Crystals of G A P D H grow reproducibly in 10-14 days at 17° from 35% ammonium sulfate at 10 mg/ml protein. The crystals appear bipyramidal and are 0.35 mm in their largest dimension. They are stable to X-ray radiation and diffract to 2.0 A resolution at room temperature. The space

Three-Dimensional S t r u c t u r e The S. solfataricus G A P D H model produced from X-ray crystallographic studies 36 has been refined to an R factor of 22.9% at 2.05 A resolution. Molecular replacement studies using the B. stearotherrnophilus enzyme as a model were initially attempted, but despite a promising solution, attempts to refine this failed. The structure of the S. solfataricus enzyme has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement techniques using the heavy atom derivatives, platinum tetrachloride (2 raM) and uranyl acetate (5 raM). The structure factors and refined coordinates of the S. solfataricus G A P D H have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank; the access code is lb7g. Despite low-sequence identity of S. solfataricus G A P D H to bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes, it has similar secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The three-dimensional structures of a bacterial G A P D H from B. stearothermophilus have been compared in detail to the archaeal S. solfataricus enzyme. 36 Figure 2 shows the amino acid sequences of known archaeal G A P D H enzymes aligned with the B. stearothermophilus G A P D H sequence on the basis of the structural superimposition. The S. solfataricus G A P D H subunit has two folding domains: the nucleotide-binding domain (residues 1-138 and 301-333; strands/3A to/3F) with a conserved double /3-a-/3-a-/3 motif fold 37 and the a//3-fold catalytic domain (residues 139-300 and 334-340; strands 131 to 139) built around a mainly antiparallel/3 sheet (Fig. 3). S. solfataricus and B. stearothermophilus G A P D H s can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 2.1 A for 230 Ca atoms (out of a total of 340 in the S. solfataricus sequence). The rest of the Ca atoms belong to the loop regions, which are a different length and/or conformation, or to additional secondary structure elements (Fig. 2). Most of the additional structural elements found in the S. solfataricus enzyme are a-helical. S. solfataricus G A P D H has two additional a helices (residues 56-62 and 70-78) between/3C and/3D. The socalled S-loop (169-178) involved in the cofactor-binding site of the bacterial enzyme between/3~ and/32 of the catalytic domain is 10 residues shorter in S. solfataricus G A P D H and adopts a different conformation.

In this way the S. solfataricus enzyme has an extra interdomain connection in comparison with its counterpart from B. stearothermophilus. The nucleotide-binding domains of the S. solfataricus and B. stearothermophilus enzymes can be superimposed with an rmsd of 2.0 ,~ for 116 matching Ca atoms and their catalytic domains superimpose with an rmsd of 1.7 A for 133 matching atoms.

domain in relation to the catalytic domain in the S. solfataricus enzyme is about 10° in comparison with the B. stearothermophilus enzyme. An interesting additional feature in the S. solfataricus archaeal enzyme is a disulfide bridge, which is formed between the residues cysteine-123 and cysteine-149. This appears to hold together an a helix and a loop structure located to the outside of the tetramer face of the monomeric unit. The position of the disulfide bridge within the monomer and with respect to the overall tetrameric structure is shown in Fig. 4. Although disulfide bonds are uncommon in intracellular enzymes, they have been observed in a number of them, including glutathione reductase,38 pyrrolidone carboxylpeptidase from Thermococcus litoralis, 39 human thioredoxin,4° and Thermus thermophilus EF-Ts. 41 It is possible that the intracellular environment in the archaeal cell will allow disulfide bonds to be maintained. The disulfide bridges found in archaeal thermophilic proteins would offer a mechanism for stabilization at high temperatures. Inspection of other arch38 p. R. E. Mittl and G. E.

aeal GAPDH primary sequences from Methanothermus fervidus, 3 Pyrococcus woesei, 4 Methanococcus jannaschii, 7A rchaeoglobus fulgidus, s and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum 9 shows these cysteine residues to be nonconserved. The S. solfataricus tetramer has 222 point group symmetry and is 86 × 84 × 80 A in size. This evolutional conservation of the tetrameric structure is probably due to the allosteric regulation of GAPDH activity, as one active site is contained within each subunit. The so-called S-loop involved in the cofactor-binding site of the bacterial enzyme interacts with subunits R and Q in the S. solfataricus enzyme, whereas in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme it interacts with subunits R and P. There is a four residue insertion (residues 186-190) after/32 that contains Pro-186 and Pro-190 in cis conformation. This loop is involved in contact with subunit P. An additional a helix between/35 and/36 and the following loop makes additional interactions with subunit Q, which are mainly salt bridges. There are several salt bridge clusters in the S. solfataricus GAPDH structure. One of these is very extensive and includes 14 charged residues, a sulfate molecule, and His-299. Although this crystal structure is that of an apoenzyme, differences can be seen in the cofactorbinding pocket that are consistent with the enzyme's preference for the cofactor NADP +. A lysine residue at the putative phosphate position of the cofactor replaces an aspartic acid residue conserved in most NAD-binding dehydrogenases.37 This lysine residue is conserved in all archaeal GAPDHs that have been sequenced to date, which is consistent with their cofactor preference. The active site Cys-139 has a rotamer different from that of the equivalent Cys-149 in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme. In bacterial and eukaryotic GAPDHs, a conserved His-176, which is located on strand/31 of the catalytic domain, is thought to act as a base extracting the proton from the Cys-149 during catalysis. However, there is no histidine residue at this position in the archaeal GAPDH structure. Instead, another residue conserved in archaea, His-219 from the strand /34 of the catalytic domain, has its imidazole group in about the same location. It has been proposed that His-219 plays the same role in the S. solfataricus enzyme as His-176 in the B. stearothermophilus counterpart. 36 The S. solfataricus enzyme was initially reported to catalyze the reaction with nonphosphorylated glyceraldehyde.42 However, its crystal structure reveals two sulfate-binding sites close to the inorganic phosphate-binding site (Pr) and substrate phosphate-binding site (Ps) as seen in B. stearothermophilus. This suggests that the S. solfataricus enzyme should have a preference for glyceraldehyde-3P over glyceraldehyde as a substrate. The P~ site

All of these residues are conserved in archaeal GAPDHs. The serine residue preceding the active site cysteine binds Pi in all known GAPDHs. The Ps site is formed by the guanidinium groups of Arg-166 and Arg-167, which are also conserved in all known archaeal G A P D H enzymes. In conclusion, although archaeal and bacterial/eukaryotic G A P D H enzymes have a related protein scaffold, the residues implicated in the catalytic mechanism and Ps and Pi binding sites are found on different structural elements of the protein.

residue retain a similar position to that found in the GAPDH enzymes studied previously. An ancestral G A P D H enzyme could have had a similar fold and a related quaternary structure but had a low turnover and broad specificity as it used only a cysteine residue for catalysis. It seems that the active sites of archaeal and bacterial/eukaryotic GAPDH enzymes eventually converged during evolution to a similar location in the threedimensional structure. The S. solfataricus enzyme is of a different class from other GAPDH structures described previously as it has additional secondary structural elements and a low sequence homology with its bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts. There are no structures of mesophilic archaeal GAPDH enzymes reported to date. This makes detailed comparisons relating to thermostability difficult. Several ion pair clusters, one of which involves 15 amino acids on the interface of subunits O and Q and extends into the active site, are proposed to be important features for the S. solfataricus enzyme thermostability. The amino acids involved in the large ion pair cluster described earlier are either totally conserved or substituted by residues carrying the same charge in other thermophilic archaeal GAPDHs. These residues are less conserved in their mesophilic archaeal counterparts. The S. solfataricus enzyme has increased hydrophobicity over known GAPDH enzymes where structural information is available. The primary sequence information available shows that S. solfataricus has a higher content of hydrophobic residues than other archaeal GAPDH enzymes. The disulfide bond, which is not common for intracellular proteins, may also contribute to the S. solfataricus enzyme thermostability. A higher percentage of amino acids in secondary structure elements, particularly in o~helices, does not seem to be important for thermostabilty in this case, as GAPDH enzymes from mesophilic archaea have high sequence identity to the S. solfataricus enzyme, suggesting that they also possess these secondary structure features.
