Abstract This review describes the role of modulation of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)/leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) interaction in controlling autoimmune diseases or inducing immunotolerance. ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction is essential for T-cell activation as well as for migration of T-cells to target tissues. This interaction also functions, along with Signal-1, as a co-stimulatory signal (Signal-2) for T-cell activation, which is delivered by the T-cell receptors (TCR)­major histocompatibility complex (MHC)­peptide complex. Therefore, blocking ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction can suppress T-cell activation in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. Many types of inhibitors (i.e. antibodies, peptides, small molecules) have been developed to block ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions, and some of these molecules have reached clinical trials. Peptides derived from ICAM-1 and LFA-1 sequences have been shown to inhibit T-cell adhesion and activation. In addition, these inhibitors have been useful in elucidating the mechanism of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction. Besides binding to LFA-1, the ICAM-1 peptide can be internalized by LFA-1 receptors into the cytoplasmic domain of T-cells. Therefore, this ICAM-1 peptide can be utilized to selectively target toxic drugs to T-cells, thus avoiding harmful side effects. Finally, bi-functional inhibitory peptide (BPI), which is made by conjugating the antigenic peptide and an LFA-1 peptide, can alter the T-cell commitment from T-helper-1 (Th1) to T-helper-2 (Th2)-like cells, suggesting that this peptide may have a role in blocking the formation of the "immunological synapse." © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Introduction The cellular and humoral immune responses generated by lymphocytes make up the body's adaptive defense against pathogens. These responses of the immune system work in cooperation to recognize and destroy "non-self" pathogen antigens. The humoral or B-lymphocyte (B-cell) immune response is centered in antibody production, while the cellular or T-lymphocyte (T-cell) immune response is built on direct cell­cell interactions. Both T- and B-cells originate from a common stem cell in bone marrow. However, B- and T-cells are distinguished by the site of their differentiation (B-cells mature in the bone marrow and T-cells in the thymus) and by their antigen receptors. The antigen receptor of B-lymphocytes is a membrane-bound form of the antibody that is secreted when B-lymphocytes are activated. When antibody molecules on B-cells bind pathogens, B-cells are

activated to synthesize and secrete antibodies specific to this antigen. In contrast to B-cells, T-cells express receptors that are specific for antigens displayed only on cell surfaces of professional antigen-presenting cells (APC). The T-cell receptors (TCR) are closely related to antibody molecules in structure, and they signal the cell when bound to antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on APC. Both T- and B-cells are selected during development against overt self-reactivity. However, this process is not unequivocal as autoreactive cells can escape deletion and, in some cases, lead to autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune disease pathology is due to the survival of a subset of T-cells that become activated and proliferate when they recognize "self" peptide as "non-self-antigen" or antigenic peptide. The recognition of self- and non-self antigens is facilitated by the TCR, which engages with cells that present an antigenic peptide bound to cell surface protein MHC (Signal-1, Fig. 1). These APC generally include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B-lymphocytes. MHC molecules

Fig. 1. Molecular interactions at the interface of T-cell and APC. Two signals are required for T-cell activation that leads to clonal expansion and generation of host immune response. Signal-1 is provided by the interaction between TCR and the MHC­peptide complex. The co-stimulatory signal (Signal-2) can be delivered by different pairs of molecules (interaction of ICAM-1/LFA-1 or B-7/CD28).

expressed by these cells are divided into two structurally different classes. MHC class I receptors are recognized by cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells or killer T-cells and present peptides that are derived from pathogen proteins generated inside the APC (i.e. virally infected or cancerous cells). MHC class II receptors present peptides usually derived from pathogens taken up from outside the APC that are recognized by CD4+ T-helper-1 (Th1) and T-helper-2 (Th2) cells. These cells help to activate B-cells to produce antibodies and macrophages for intracellular killing of pathogens harbored inside target cells [75]. Both an antigen-specific (Signal-1) and a co-stimulatory signal (Signal-2) are necessary to activate na¨ve T-cells i during the interaction between the APC and T-cell (Fig. 1) [32]. MHC-antigen binding to TCR in the absence of a co-stimulatory signal (Signal-2, Fig. 1) not only fails to activate the cell but also leads to a state called anergy in which the T-cell becomes refractory to activation. The recognition of "non-self" antigens by a specific TCR transmits the main activation signal (Signal-1, Fig. 1) for these T-cells to undergo clonal expansion. This signaling needs to be sustained up to several hours, for complete activation [43]. This co-stimulatory signal (Signal-2) is caused by interactions of several different pairs of molecules at the interface between T-cells and APC, including the interaction between leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on T-cells and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the APC or the interaction between B-7 (found on B-cells) and CD28 (found on T-cells) (Fig. 1). A high density of

TCR­MHC-antigen complexes cannot compensate for the lack of a co-stimulatory signal such as ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction for CD4+ T-cell activation [1]. The source of this secondary signal can influence the type of response generated by T-cells. For example, blocking CD28/B-7 inhibits IL-4 and IL-5 (Th2 cytokines) production, while blocking ICAM-1/LFA-1 leads to a significant increase in Th2 cytokines [90]. Another study demonstrated that co-stimulation by ICAM-1/LFA-1 strongly inhibits IL-10 production, which may favor the development of Th1 rather than Th2 cells [59]. To facilitate T-cell interaction with antigen-presenting cells, leukocytes that circulate as non-adherent cells can be recruited to a specific site of infection or inflammation. The molecules that allow the migration and adhesion of T-cells are selectins, cadherins, integrins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) such as ICAM-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [101]. Cytokine (i.e. IL-4 or IFN- ) released at the site of infection induces the expression of certain adhesion molecules and creates a chemotactic gradient to recruit T-cells. The process of recruitment first involves T-cells rolling along the surface of vascular endothelial cells, followed by the arrest and, finally, migration of T-cells into tissue [15,102,121,124]. The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) involved in the initial steps of recruitment are E- and P-selectins, followed by L-selectin [7,96]. The arrest process involves the tethering (adhesion) and spreading of T-cells [10,30]. Molecules that play a critical role in controlling this process are

integrins such as very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), which is one of six identified 1 integrins, and LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), which is part of the 2 integrin family that includes Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) [14,22]. The ligands for these integrins include VCAM-1 for VLA-4 and ICAM-1, -2, and -3 for LFA-1. The secure adhesion of T-cells to epithelial or endothelial cells represents the demarcation point that allows T-cells to complete extravasation into the surrounding tissue. When ICAM-1/LFA-1 interact, it decreases adhesion mediated by VLA-4 and -5, indicating that a hierarchy exists in which LFA-1 plays a predominant role over VLA-mediated T-cell migration [86]. By inhibiting ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction, T-cells are prevented from firm adhesion to epithelial, endothelial, or APC cells and are thus prevented from taking part in the immune response. One example of this therapeutic principle is the administration of anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LFA-1 antibodies, which inhibit lymphocyte binding to allografts, thus preventing organ transplant rejection [44,78,106,108]. Allograft rejection is initiated by the activation of T-cells recognizing alloantigens, which then infiltrate to the site of graft for tissue destruction. Therefore, this review is focused on the mechanism of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction and on the development of molecules (i.e. peptides and peptidomimetics) that modulate the ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction in controlling autoimmune diseases and possibly inducing immunotolerance.

and VLA-4 is down-regulated, while ICAM-1 and LFA-1 is upregulated [83]. Therefore, one possible target for new AIDS therapy is preventing the HIV from utilizing adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and LFA-1 for budding and transfer processes. The interaction between lymphocytes and tumor cells is mediated by ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction; this interaction induces inflammatory cytokine release necessary for the termination of tumor growth. Tumor cells with high levels of cell adhesion molecules are selected to form metastatic lesions; the types of adhesion molecules vary with malignancy, site of metastasis, and tumor origin [56]. For example, the high expression of ICAM-1 is associated with pancreatic cancer and pulmonary adenocarcinoma tumor progression [46,93]. On the other hand, primary and secondary gastric cancer cells have lower ICAM-1 expression than normal cells, and this low ICAM-1 expression suppresses LFA-1-dependent immune responses [27]. Based on their importance in both T-cell adhesion and activation, LFA-1 and ICAM-1 molecules have become attractive targets for developing new therapies and diagnostic tools for autoimmune diseases, cancer and viral diseases. A growing understanding of the structure and function of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 and the mechanism of their interaction on the cell surface makes it possible to develop therapies based on modulation of these adhesion molecules. 3. Structure and interaction of ICAM/LFA-1

2. LFA-1 and ICAM-1 roles in disease pathology 3.1. Structure of LFA-1 A greater understanding of the roles of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 in specific disease pathologies may provide new targets for potential therapies. The pathology of many autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), thyroiditis, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) involve the infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes to a certain organ or site in the body [53,103,118,124]. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, strong expression of Mac-1, LFA-1, and ICAM-1, and a number of cytokines allows the synovial tissue to be infiltrated by inflammatory cells [39]. In MS, leukocytes were found to exhibit significantly higher adhesion capacity than normal and expressed higher levels of LFA-1, suggesting that ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction may determine adherence of leukocytes to brain microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) and the disease pathology [8,65]. Cell adhesion molecules have been shown to mediate viral budding and transfer [79,94,101]. Primary HIV-1 is known to incorporate host-derived ICAM-1 on the viral particle surface, which can bind to LFA-1 on the T-cell surface, leading to a significant increase in viral infectivity [25,26,101]. A study has demonstrated that the high affinity form of LFA-1 leads to increased viral entry and is thought to be involved in HIV syncytium formation [4]. HIV infection can also alter the expression of cell adhesion molecules in patients; for example, CD4+-lymphocyte expression of L-selectin LFA-1, which belongs to the 2 -integrin family, is a cell surface receptor found on leukocytes. Other receptors in the same family are Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18; d 2 ) and p150,59 (CD11c/CD18). LFA-1 has L - and 2 -subunits, which are designated as CD11a, and CD18, respectively. The L -subunit of LFA-1 contains an I- (inserted) domain that is essential for binding to its ligands (i.e. ICAM-1). In fact, the I-domain alone has been demonstrated to be sufficient for full adhesive activity of LFA-1 [67]. The X-ray crystal structure of the I-domain has been solved with and without bound ligand (Fig. 2a­c) [52,62]. The X-ray structure of the I-domain reveals a dinucleotide-binding fold of a central -sheet surrounded by seven -helices. This I-domain sits on top of the N-terminus of the -subunit, which has a -propeller structure formed by seven "blades" of -sheets. The I-domain and the -propeller are tethered with a hinge sequence that allows them to move in position relative to one another [71,72]. The 2 -subunit is also necessary for the function of LFA-1 in leukocyte activation and immune response. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) patients have leukocytes that do not express a functional 2 -subunit; these patients are prone to serious infection because their T-cells cannot adhere to APC or migrate to the site of infection [42]. The 2 -subunit also

has a sequence known as the I-like domain located near the N-terminus; its structure is homologous to the I-domain of the L -subunit. In addition, the I-like domain is suggested to interact with -propeller domain of the L -subunit. Because both the I-like- and I-domains are associated with the -propeller, it is suggested that the two domains are close together at the interface between the L - and 2 -subunits of LFA-1 [6]. Both the L - and 2 -subunits contain divalent cation binding sites. LFA-1 binding to its ligand (ICAM-1) is dependent on the binding of divalent cations Mg2+ and Ca2+ [16,33,45,87]. The Ca2+ -binding motifs are contained in the EF-hand-like domains, which are predicted to be on the lower surface of the -propeller [81]. A calcium-dependent epitope of LFA-1, recognized by monoclonal antibody NKI-L16, correlates with enhanced LFA-1 avidity for ICAM-1 and adhesion by the reorganization of LFA-1 into clusters on the cell surface [116]. In the cation-bound form of LFA-1, a series of acidic residues in the I-domain provides the direct link between LFA-1 and ICAM-1. This binding site is called the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), in which side-chains of Ser-139, Ser-141, Asp-237,

Thr-206, and Asp-239 of the I-domain are involved in coordinating Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Fig. 2b) [72]. A glutamic acid residue of ICAM-1 is suggested to participate in this cation coordination complex during binding to LFA-1 [72,87]. 3.2. Structure of ICAM-1 ICAM-1 belongs to the IgSF, which includes vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MadCAM-1) [101]. ICAM-1 is found at the cell surface of endothelial and epithelial cells, leukocytes, dermal fibroblasts, melanocytes, and many carcinoma cell types. Cytokines such as IFN- , IL-1, and TNFare known to increase the expression of ICAM-1 that facilitates a selective recruitment of leukocytes in a variety of pathological states [39,73]. ICAM-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that has five immunoglobulin-like domains (D1­D5); mutational studies have revealed that domain-1 (D1) contains residues that are crucial for binding to LFA-1 [12,18]. On the cell surface, ICAM-1 exists predominantly in a dimeric form that

491

binds more efficiently to LFA-1 than does its monomeric form [74]. However, a single ICAM-1 monomer contains the "fully competent" LFA-1 binding surface [51]. The X-ray crystal structure of D1­D2 of ICAM-1 shows that the N-terminal of D1 functions as the interface of the dimer formation (Fig. 2d) [50]. Also, the residues that bind to LFA-1 are oriented with the critical Glu-34 residue (Fig. 2d) pointing away from each other in the dimer, which is ideal for simultaneous binding of two LFA-1 molecules. The LFA-1 binding surface is relatively flat, runs diagonally across the GFC -sheet face, and includes residues on the CD edge of the -sandwich on the D1 [12]. This site is proposed to dock at a groove in the I-domain of LFA-1 [11]. 3.3. Mechanism and function of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction The mechanism of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction involves a conformational change in the structure of LFA-1 [41,104]. Normally, LFA-1 is expressed in a low affinity state for its ligand (i.e. ICAM-1) and, thus, cells do not make unnecessary adhesive contacts while in circulation [104]. The affinity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1 is mediated by a conformational change in the I-domain from a closed (non-binding; Fig. 2c) to an opened (ligand-binding) form (Fig. 2c) [71]. Upon cation coordination, there is a reorganization of the residues at a MIDAS region in which a direct metal bond to Asp-237 residue is lost and a direct bond to Thr-206 is gained [41]. This small conformational change propagates a more extensive change that involves breaking contact between the -propeller and the I-like domain [41]. Recently, a study has suggested that there is a cation-dependent interaction between the I-domain and the I-like domain that occurs only in the active receptor and not in the inactive receptor [120]. Unlike the opened conformation, the closed conformation (Fig. 2c) of the I-domain is not able to bind ICAM-1 (Fig. 2b). The reason for this is that the C-terminal -helix-7, which connects the I-domain to the -propeller, undergoes a major swing (10 Å downward) in the ligand-bound or open conformation that correlates with the reorganization of the MIDAS motif and the high affinity form of LFA-1 (Fig. 2b and c) [41]. This region is part of the I-domain allosteric site (IDAS) that regulates the activation of LFA-1 to its high affinity state [71]. The isolated I-domain can be expressed in the constitutively open (ligand binding) or closed (non-binding) form. The locked opened form was produced by mutation of K287 and K294 to C287 and C294 residues, and a disulfide bond was formed between C287 and C294. In contrast, mutation of L289 and K294 to Cys-298 and C294 residues followed by a formation of a disulfide bond produced a closed conformation of the I-domain [67]. The results show that the I-domain open form binds ICAM-1 but the closed form does not. In addition, the adhesion property of the modified I-domain was abolished by the reduction of the disulfide bond [67]. Many small molecule inhibitors of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction have been shown to bind the I-domain between the C-terminal -helix-7 and the central

-sheet to stabilize the closed conformation [52,60,64,120]. In the non-ligand binding form of LFA-1, the I-like domain ( 2 -subunit) makes contact with -sheets 2 and 3 of the -propeller domain, while the I-domain ( L -subunit) is thought to be held in closed conformation by its contacts with the -propeller and, potentially, by the I-like domain [66]. Activation of LFA-1 receptors can be divided into two signaling processes: "outside-in" and "inside-out" mechanisms that are responsible for cell proliferation [117] or prevention of cell apoptosis [58]. The "outside-in" signal can be triggered via binding of LFA-1 to outside stimuli (i.e. ICAM-1) that produce a signaling cascade in the cytoskeletal region. This signaling cascade includes activation of the tyrosine kinase -associated protein-70 (Zap-70), which initiates the activation of other LFA-1 molecules to form clusters [98]. Clusters of LFA-1 with high avidity to multivalent ICAM-1 result in signaling that leads to F-actin polymerization and higher order F-actin bundling [70,85]. In fact, LFA-1 receptor clustering may be the initial step leading to the conformational change that gives rise to the high affinity form of LFA-1 [41]. Clustered LFA-1 is also involved in "cross talk" with growth factor receptors through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling [123]. Thus, LFA-1 provides a bi-directional intersection where extracellular and intracellular signals are transmitted. LFA-1 acts not only as an adhesion molecule but also as a signaling receptor for the reorganization of F-actin filaments in T-cell-dependent processes. Although the cytoplasmic domain of LFA-1 is short and devoid of enzymatic features, it is thought that signaling is transduced by associating with adaptor proteins to couple them to the cytoskeleton, cytoplasmic kinases, and G-coupled receptors [114]. The enhanced avidity, or clustering, of LFA-1 also facilitates the recruitment of other signaling components such as cytohesin-1 that interact with the 2 -cytoplasmic tail [114]. Unless activated by exogenous divalent cations, cytohesin-1 (a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF GTPases) binds to LFA-1 and mediates "inside-out" signaling through another second messenger, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) [29]. The "inside-out" signal can be produced via activation of other cell surface molecules such as TCR and CD2 that induce second messengers to alter the activation state of LFA-1 [80]. The exact mechanism by which these second messenger signals are translated to induce a high affinity form of LFA-1 is still under investigation. However, it is thought that the phosphorylation of 2 -subunit residues and the interaction of adaptor proteins such as cytohesin-1 and paxillin with the integrin cytoplasmic tails induces a conformational change in LFA-1 [29,40,57,77,119]. This change could be propagated across the membrane, altering the interaction of the -propeller and I-like domain and thus leading to a change in LFA-1 affinity for ICAM-1. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the separation of the membrane-proximal regions of the L - and 2 -subunits of

492

LFA-1 results in integrin activation, while association of these segments restricts LFA-1 in the inactive state [68]. LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 leads to LFA-1 activation by phorbol esters (e.g. PMA), induces clustering by bypassing early signaling events transmitted by other cell surface receptors and directly activating PKC [21,69,115]. During T-cell activation, it is found that protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (i.e. - and -I/II) phosphorylate several serine and theronine residues at the C-terminal of the 2 -subunit (CD18) of LFA-1, and this phosphorylation process plays a role in regulating the adhesive state or ability to signal [24]. It is proposed that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CD18 leads to the recruitment of other proteins to the activated integrin [24]. TCR binding to the MHC-Ag-complex activates a tyrosine kinase Lck that has been implicated in LFA-1 function and activity, including the formation of the heterodimer and cell surface expression [23,111]. Lck deficiency can abrogate TCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling and trigger phosphatidyl inositol pathways, as well as the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways like MAP kinase [105]. Lck mediates T-cell activation via phosphorylation of immunoreceptor-based tyrosine activation (ITAM) motif in the TCR complex cytoplasmic tails, which results in the recruitment and activation of Zap-70 [34,98,105]. Activated T-cells express another CD45 isoform that associates with the TCR and CD4, making T-cells more sensitive to stimulation by low concentrations of peptide­MHC complexes [2,100]. CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase found on all white blood cells, regulates the dephosphorylation of Lck, and engagement of CD45 has been shown to induce homotypic LFA-1-mediated adhesion of T-cells [2]. LFA-1 activation has also been correlated with the activation of cell surface chemokine receptor 4 with stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) signaling [99]. The chemokine signal can be amplified even when the SDF-1 level is low; this signaling process engages GTPases Cdc42, RhoA, and actinomyosin in the activation of LFA-1 [98,99].

action, antibodies to other cell adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 and B-7 have been developed, and their effectiveness has been demonstrated in vivo (Table 1) [63,124]. In addition to their use as therapeutic drugs, antibodies are also important tools for understanding the mechanism by which LFA-1 conformational change is linked to signaling pathways that lead to the leukocyte activation. The "inside-out" signaling for LFA-1 activation can be detected using antibodies to the cysteine-rich repeats of the 2 -subunit. During LFA-1 "inside-out" activation, some epitopes of the cysteine-rich region were exposed due to a conformational change in the stalk region of 2 -subunit, and these exposed epitopes were detected using antibodies [66]. These results suggested that the activation of the headpiece of LFA-1 was initiated by the cytoplasmic domain and translated through the stalk region of the 2 -subunit. In the future, it may be possible to develop a way to control the activation of LFA-1 by controlling the "inside-out" signaling via the stalk region of LFA-1. Although antibodies are effective, their use as therapeutic agents does present a number of pharmaceutical challenges. Due to their physicochemical properties, antibodies cannot be delivered orally and are expensive to produce. In addition, antibodies are prone to physical as well as chemical degradation, which make them difficult to formulate. Antibodies can also generate immunogenicity upon repeated injections to produce immune reaction. Therefore, some efforts have been focused on developing peptide, peptidomimetic, or small molecule inhibitors of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction for treating autoimmune diseases. 4.2. Peptides and small molecules Progress has been made in developing peptides, peptidomimetics and small molecules that can inhibit ICAM-1/ LFA-1 interaction to control immune response in autoimmune diseases and allograft rejection [35,124,125]. In this section, we describe the structure and mechanism of action of peptides and small molecules that have been found to modulate ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction. Table 1 shows several examples of peptides and small molecules that have been investigated as well as their possible mode of action. Due to the large number of compounds, this table does not represent the entire spectrum of possibilities of potential therapeutic agents that can inhibit ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction. 4.2.1. ICAM-1-derived peptides Peptides derived from the sequence of ICAM-1 have been evaluated for their ability to modulate the binding of anti-CD11a antibody to T-cells as well as their capacity to inhibit homotypic T-cell adhesion. Peptides derived from D1 of ICAM-1 (ICAM1­21 and ICAM25­50 ) inhibited the homotypic T-cell adhesion and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) [95,109]. Although both of these peptides inhibited homotypic T-cell adhesion, it was interesting to find that the ICAM1­21 peptide inhibited anti-CD11a antibody while

4. Modulating or inhibiting ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction 4.1. Antibodies As the understanding of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction has grown, so too, has the pharmaceutical industry's interest in developing ways to modulate this interaction. The therapeutic effectiveness of inhibiting ICAM-1/LFA-1 binding has previously been demonstrated by the administration of anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LFA-1 antibodies to prevent allograft rejection [44,107] and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [5,76]. Currently, antibody therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [54,91] and psoriasis [31,82] are being developed, and many have progressed through Phase I, II, and III trials (Table 1).

the ICAM25­50 peptide enhanced the anti-CD11a antibody binding to LFA-1 on T-cells [110]. These results suggest that these two fragments bound to different sites of the LFA-1 receptor and have different mechanisms of action in inhibiting T-cell homotypic adhesion. It is possible that the ICAM1­21 peptide binds to CD11a at the same site as the antibody and inhibits both anti-CD11a antibody and ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1. On the other hand, the ICAM25­50 peptide may bind to a different region on CD11a and induce a conformational change of LFA-1 that favors anti-CD11a antibody binding but inhibits ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1. The ICAM1­21 peptide was further studied by fragmenting its sequence into overlapping cyclic peptides: cIBL (ICAM1­10 ), cIBC (ICAM6­15 ), and cIBR (ICAM12­21 ;

Table 1) [36,37,47,95]. These cyclic peptides were found to have higher activities than the parent peptide (ICAM1­21 ) in inhibiting homotypic T-cell adhesion, MLR, and heterotypic T-cell adhesion [36,37,47,95,110]. These results suggest that conformational restriction in cyclic peptides creates a more rigid structure that accommodates better binding to LFA-1 and blocks ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction. Initially, the mechanism of inhibition of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction by ICAM-1 peptides was thought to be due solely to their ability to bind LFA-1 at the ICAM-1 binding site. Recently, we discovered that these ICAM-1 peptides were also internalized by LFA-1 into the cytoplasmic domain of T-cells [37]. Localization of FITC-labeled ICAM-1 peptide (FITC-cIBR) inside T-cells was followed using confocal

microscopy as well as flow cytometry [37]. Other ICAM-1 cyclic peptides (cIBL and cIBC) behaved similarly when binding to LFA-1 on the T-cells. These results suggest that ICAM-1 peptides trigger an internalization of LFA-1 and lower the adhesion properties of T-cells. The FITC-labeled peptides (FITC-cIBL, FITC-cIBC, and FITC-cIBR) bound to soluble-LFA-1 (sLFA-1) as determined by ELISA. Binding of both FITC-cIBC and FITC-cIBR to sLFA-1 can be inhibited with anti-CD11a antibodies to the I-domain, suggesting that these peptides bind to the I-domain of LFA-1. Furthermore, FITC-labeled cIBR peptide was colocalized with anti-CD18 antibodies on the surface of T-cells as determined by confocal microscopy, indicating that this peptide binds to LFA-1. In summary, these ICAM-1 peptides can bind to and are internalized by LFA-1 on the surface of T-cells. The conformational stability of cyclic peptides cIBC and cIBR contributes to a better binding property than that of the linear peptides. The conformation of the cyclic peptides of cIBC and cIBR was determined using NMR and molecular modeling [36,47]. Interestingly, the overlapping sequence (Pro-Arg-Gly-Gly) of both peptides was found to form a -turn, similar to the same sequence in the ICAM-1 X-ray structure of D1. In the X-ray structure of D1­D2 of ICAM-1, this -turn plays a role in stabilizing the angle between D1 and D2 in ICAM-1 (Fig. 2d) [12]. The activity of overlapping linear hexapeptides derived from ICAM1­21 suggests that the -turn in Pro-Arg-Gly-Gly sequence found in cIBC and cIBR peptides is important for binding to LFA-1. 4.2.2. LFA-1-derived peptides Peptides derived from the L - and 2 -subunits of LFA-1 have been shown to inhibit homotypic and heterotypic T-cell adhesion as well as MLR. Linear peptide LAB (CD11a237­261 ) and its derivatives [cyclic peptides CD11a237­246 (cLAB.L), CD11a244­253 (cLAB.C), CD11a251­261 (cLAB.R)] were derived from the I-domain of the -subunit [95,109,110]. The second peptide fragment was discovered from the divalent cation-binding region of the L -subunit (CD11a441­465 ; LAB.2). The cyclic peptide (CD11a441­450 ; cLAB.2L) from the N-terminal of LAB.2 peptide was found to have biological activity similar to that of the parent peptide, and both of these peptides (LAB.2 and cLAB.2L) were able to complex with calcium and magnesium ions as in the LFA-1 [47,49]. The last peptides were discovered from the 2 -subunit (CD18112­137 ), called LBE peptide [48,109] and its cyclic peptides derived from the N-terminal (CD18112­122 , cLBE.L) and center region (CD18120­129 , cLBE.C) and they were determined to be active in inhibiting homotypic T-cell adhesion and suppressing MLR. The mechanism of binding of cLAB.L peptide (derived from the I-domain of LFA-1; Table 1) to ICAM-1 was evaluated using T-cells, epithelial, and endothelial cells [126­128]. The cLAB.L peptide was found to inhibit ho-

motypic and heterotypic T-cell adhesion to epithelial and endothelial monolayers [127]. Using antibody inhibition studies, cLAB.L peptide was found to bind D1 of ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 on T-cells as well as epithelial cell (Caco-2) monolayers [122,128]. Binding of FTIC-labeled cLAB.L peptide to ICAM-1 on T-cells was enhanced when the cells were activated with PMA and anti-CD3 antibody, and this binding was also enhanced in the presence of a mixture of calcium and magnesium ions [128]. Using NMR and CD, the cLAB.L peptide was found to have a stable conformation, and it could bind to the calcium and magnesium ions [49]. Furthermore, docking studies indicated that this peptide could bind at the calcium binding site of D1 of ICAM-1 [122]. The cLAB.L peptide activity to inhibit heterotypic T-cell adhesion to epithelial monolayers can be enhanced by treatment of ICAM-1-expressing cells with LBE peptide derived from the 2 -subunit. Interestingly, the cLAB.L peptide can be internalized by ICAM-1 into the cell cytoplasmic domain [128]. The internalization of adhesion molecules has been observed in a number of studies, and could be an alternative mechanism of inhibiting cell adhesion [3,88,89]. Therefore, this peptide was evaluated to determine if internalization facilitated its ability to inhibit T-cell adhesion to epithelial cells. The results indicated that cLAB.L peptide was able to inhibit adhesion in a temperature- and concentrationdependent manner, which implied that both binding and internalization contributed to peptide activity [127]. Inhibition at 37  C was greater than at 4  C, indicating that an energy-dependent process was involved in peptide activity [127]. 4.2.3. Other peptides Another approach to identify peptides that inhibit ICAM-1/LFA-1 is to utilize a high-throughput screen of peptides by a phage display library. In one study, phages bearing cyclic peptide sequences were screened for their ability to bind ICAM-1 [92]. Bound phages were eluted using anti-ICAM-1 antibody (84H10). Using this method, cyclic and linear peptides (IP01) were identified to bind ICAM-1 and inhibit T-cell adhesion. The cyclic peptide IP01 (Table 1) did not have any homology with the LFA-1 sequence. It is suggested that there are several possible mechanisms of action for IP01 peptide: (a) this peptide binds to ICAM-1 at the same binding site as LFA-1 peptides, (b) it binds to ICAM-1 at the proximal site of the LFA-1 binding region and induces steric inhibition, and (c) the peptide binds ICAM-1 at the allosteric site that controls the LFA-1-binding site [92]. Alanine scanning of this peptide sequence demonstrated the essential amino acids involved in the activity of this peptide, and suggested that these residues may mimic the epitopes of either LFA-1 or ICAM-1 [92]. Peptide-based therapy was also derived by controlling the signaling mechanisms of LFA-1 instead of direct inhibition of ICAM-1/LFA-1 (Table 1). Intracellular

signaling mediated by LFA-1 oligomerization activates calcium-calmodulin kinase (CAMKII) and leads to the release of perforin, granzymes, and IFN- in NK cells, which can lead to the activation and differentiation of na¨ve T-cells [129]. A peptide derived from the C-terminal i domain of the HIV-1 Tat protein was found to block calcium influx and LFA-1-mediated activation of CAMKII [84]. This study provided evidence that exogenous peptide treatment was able to inhibit NK cell activation occurring upon contact with DC; this mechanism might contribute to the impairment of natural immunity in HIV-1 infection. 4.2.4. Small molecules Research efforts to find small molecules that inhibit ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction have identified several compounds that can bind to the I-domain of LFA-1. For example, lovastatin (Table 1) was found to bind the I-domain of LFA-1 at the IDAS region (Fig. 2a) and inhibited ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction by preventing the LFA-1 conformational change to the activated form via allosteric control [64]. The X-ray crystal structure of LFA-1 and lovastatin complex reveals that lovastatin interacts with Leu-132, Phe-153, Ile-235, Tyr-257, Lys-287, Leu-298, Glu-301, Leu-302 and Lys-305 residues that help form a large hydrophobic cavity between the central -sheet and -helix-7 of the I-domain [52]. Other small molecule inhibitors of ICAM-1/LFA-1 such as a series of p-arylthio cinnamides and hydantoin derivatives (i.e. BRIT-377; Table 1) were also found to bind to this IDAS site and inhibit ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction via an allosteric modification of LFA-1 [60,64]. Additionally, BRIT-377 has been shown to lower the IL-2 production in vivo and has been developed for oral formulation [55]. The hydantoin derivatives bound in the hydrophobic pocket of I-domain around -helices 1 and 7 and -strands 2, 1, and 3. Because of the discovery of this allosteric mechanism, some of the small molecules have been utilized to detect conformational changes in LFA-1 upon binding to the I-domain or an I-like domain [120]. These studies suggest that the I-domain may have a functional relationship with the I-like domain; therefore, targeting one or both of these sites may allow selective control of LFA-1 binding properties. Peptidomimetic inhibitors of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction were designed from non-linear epitopes of D1 of ICAM-1 (Table 1) [28]. The peptidomimetics bound to LFA-1 and inhibited ICAM-1 binding to leukocytes as well as MRL. The peptidomimetics were designed using the knowledge of essential residues in D1 of ICAM-1 such as Glu-34, Lys-39, Met-64, Tyr-66, Asn-68, and Gln-73 that were important for binding to LFA-1. The C ­C side chain vectors of these residues as seen in the X-ray structure of D1 of ICAM-1 were used to design the functional groups or molecular modules of the peptidomimetics. The resulting peptidomimetics demonstrated the ability to bind isolated LFA-1, and one of the peptidomimetic was able to inhibit MLR better than cyclosporin A.

5. Peptide­drug conjugate for cell-specific targeting Both the ICAM-1- and LFA-1-derived peptides previously described exhibited properties consistent with receptor-mediated internalization, which presents a unique strategy for drug delivery [37,128]. By conjugating these peptides to an anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory drug, the internalization of this peptide-conjugate could selectively target and deliver drugs to cells expressing these cell adhesion molecules (Fig. 3). We are currently studying this drug delivery mechanism; this approach could eliminate systemic side effects of toxic drugs and may also overcome drug resistance by avoiding the efflux pumps. Fig. 3 shows that methotrexate (MTX)­cIBR conjugate can bind to and be internalized by LFA-1 into the cytoplasmic domain, and the MTX fragment of the conjugate can inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity. The ICAM-1-derived peptide cIBR was conjugated to MTX to determine its ability to deliver drugs to LFA-1-expressing cells (Fig. 3). The effects of conjugation on both the activity of peptide binding to LFA-1 and MTX activity were evaluated. The MTX­cIBR conjugate, like the unconjugated cIBR peptide, was found to block anti-LFA-1 antibodies in T-cells activated by PMA, suggesting that the ability of the peptide to bind LFA-1 was not affected by conjugation. Importantly, the NMR solution structures of MTX­cIBR and cIBR were analyzed, and the peptide portion of MTX­cIBR had a structure similar to cIBR alone. This suggests that conjugation with MTX did not alter the structure of the peptide fragment in the MTX­cIBR conjugate. MTX­cIBR conjugate activity was compared to that of MTX in inhibiting DHFR. DHFR inhibition is one mechanism of MTX anti-cancer activity, and studies have demonstrated that MTX­cIBR (Kd = 29.8 × 10-9 M) has a 10-fold lower affinity for DHFR than that of MTX (Kd = 1.84 × 10-9 M). This lower affinity may be due to the interference in binding between the MTX-fragment and DHFR by the cIBR-fragment. Low dose MTX is also widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and its mechanism of activity is thought to be due to inhibition of the production of TNF- . Studies have demonstrated that equimolar doses of either MTX or MTX-conjugates reduce TNF- production in human PBMCs stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. These studies indicate that MTX conjugation does not significantly reduce the activity of MTX. In comparison to MTX alone, MTX­cIBR was toxic for T-cells but not endothelial cells that do not have LFA-1, suggesting that the internalization of MTX­cIBR is mediated by LFA-1. Further studies have demonstrated that blocking LFA-1 with either anti-LFA-1 or unconjugated cIBR peptide decreases the toxicity of MTX­cIBR conjugates to T-cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that MTX­cIBR is internalized by LFA-1. Therefore, MTX­peptide internalization mediated by LFA-1 is a novel

peptide-based drug-delivery system that could be used to selectively target T-cells involved in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. This conjugation method could also be applied to other toxic anticancer drugs.

6. Simultaneous inhibition of Signal-1/Signal-2 Signal-1 and -2 are necessary for T-cell activation, and both signals interact at the interface between T-cells and APC membranes [17,61,97,113]. Signal-1 is the recognition of the MHC­peptide complex on the surface of APC by TCR on T-cell surface. This first signal is accompanied by a co-stimulatory signal (Signal-2) that can be delivered by different molecular interactions including ICAM-1/LFA-1; CTLA-4/B-7-1, -2; CD28/B-7-1, -2; ICOS/B7h; PD-1/PD-L1; and CD401/CD40 [17,61,97,113]. It is interesting to note that the differentiation of CD4+ T-cells into Th1 and Th2 populations is influenced by a co-stimulatory Signal-2 such as ICAM-1/LFA-1 versus CD28/B-7. The combination of Signal-1 and -2 leads to the formation of an "immunological synapse" at the interface of T-cells and APC [9,17,19,20,112,113]. The mechanism of this synapse formation has been studied by following the dynamic movements of fluorescence-labeled MHC-II­peptide complex and ICAM-1 on artificial planar membranes after the addition of T-cells [32]. Within a period of 5 min, ICAM-1/LFA-1 molecules interact and form a zone separate from the TCR­MHC­peptide complex. Initially, the TCR­MHC­peptide complexes form at an outer region or ring and the ICAM-1/LFA-1 complexes form at the inner region of the synapse (Fig. 4a). As the T-cell activation process proceeds, the ICAM-1/LFA-1 clusters migrate to the outer ring and the TCR­MHC­peptide complex moves to the inner ring (Fig. 4a and b). The TCR­MHC­peptide complexes congregate in the center of central zone supramolecular ac-

tivation complex (cSMAC) and the ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions form a ring around the central zone that is called peripheral zone supramolecular activation complex (pSMAC) (Fig. 4b and c). As previously mentioned, the duration of TCR­MHC­peptide engagement is key to the signaling process. The "immunological synapse" formation takes several minutes and facilitates the initial signal (Signal-1) involving tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR- and intracellular calcium release. Our hypothesis is that the immune synapse formation can be blocked using a bi-functional peptide inhibitor (BPI) that is composed of antigenic peptide GAD-65 and LFA-1 peptide conjugated with a spacer (Table 1). Presumably, this BPI can bind simultaneously to ICAM-1 and MHC on the surface of APC to avoid the crossing of these two signals to form immune synapse when a specific T-cell binds to the APC (Fig. 4d). To prove this hypothesis, the formation of insulitis in NOD mice primed with GAD-65/CFA was challenged with BPI. The group of mice treated with BPI had a low score of insulitis (25%) compared to NOD mice treated with PBS (insulitis score of 80%). It is interesting that the T-cells isolated from BPI-treated mice produced IL-4 when stimulated with ConA, suggesting that in BPI-treated mice the development of effector T-cells was altered from Th1 to Th2-like response. On the other hand, T-cells isolated from PBS-treated NOD mice produce IFN- , suggesting the preference of Th1 response. Next, the T-cells from the BPI-treated NOD mice were isolated and injected into NOD.SCID mice that had been primed with CD25-depleted diabetogenic T-cells. The T-cells from BPI-treated NOD mice can suppress the increase of glucose levels in NOD.SCID mice. On the other hand, control NOD.SCID mice that were injected with CD25-depleted diabetogenic T-cells and challenged with isolated T-cells from PBS-treated NOD mice had diabetes with high glucose levels. The exact mechanism of BPI in controlling the

T-cell commitment is not clear and warrants further investigation. Nonetheless, these results suggest that BPI could potentially disrupt the formation of the "immunological synapse" and alter the fate of the activated T-cells from the Th1 to Th2-like cells that produce IL-4 and suppress the insulitis progression. In the future, we will attempt to answer many questions related to the mechanism of action of BPI in controlling T-cell activation via the regulation of "immunological synapse" formation.

peptides, and small molecules has impacted understanding the structure and function of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 as well as the interaction of ICAM-1/LFA-1. The potential for new therapies to halt the progression of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases will grow as the understanding of ICAM-1/LFA-1 interaction grows.
