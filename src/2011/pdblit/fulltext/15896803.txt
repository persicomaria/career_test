Abstract ∞ The structural effects on DNA double helices of confinement in hydrophobic nanotubes (NT) with 30 and 40 A diameters have been studied by classical molecular dynamics. For systems with the counter ions included inside the NT, there is little effect on the ∞ average DNA secondary structure relative to unconfined DNA. The DNA confined to the 40 A NT shows little change in thermal ∞ fluctuations compared to unconfined DNA; however, a decrease is observed in the 30 A NT. Finally, exclusion of ions from the NT leads to structures that deviate significantly from both canonical A- and B-DNA. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The structural and dynamical properties of DNA in novel chemical environments are of growing interest for many applications including the development of new DNA sequencing and amplification technologies, the design and delivery of nucleic acids and analogs for gene-based therapies, and even the development of DNA-containing synthetic nanostructures. In this Letter, we study the effect of confinement on the structure and dynamics of DNA oligomers in a hydrophobic nanotube using classical molecular dynamics. We have used a non-polarizable carbon nanotube to model the hydrophobic pore. However, true carbon nanotubes are highly polarizable [1], and therefore these simulations more closely approximate pores formed from solid-state substrates [2] or in lipid bilayers by proteins [3] or synthetic organic compounds [4]. Several earlier experimental and theoretical studies have been published on the transport of DNA or RNA through nanotubes. Gao et al. [5] used classical molecular dynamics simulations to show that single

stranded DNA oligomers are drawn into narrow carbon ∞ nanotubes (14 A diameter) due to van der Waals and hydrophobic forces, and Yeh and Hummer [6] have simulated the electrophoretic transport of single-stranded RNA through short carbon nanotubes. Gao and Kong [7] also describe preliminary results for dsDNA in nanotubes in a recent review. Matile and co-workers [4] have shown experimental results strongly suggesting that ∞ DNA double helices can be drawn through 20≠30 A diameter artificial transmembrane pores without disrupting the pore or the B-form structure of the DNA double helix. Li et al. [8] showed experimentally that ∞ double stranded DNA could pass through a 30 A diameter solid-state silicon nitride nanopore when a voltage bias was applied. The transport of much larger dsDNA molecules through a multiwalled carbon nanotube (77 nm diameter) was observed by time-resolved fluorescence microscopy [9]. This study showed that even DNA molecules with radii of gyration (370 nm) much larger than the nanotube diameter were transported through at a high membrane potential. Because a lag time of up to several seconds was observed before transport took place, these results were interpreted as the time required for the DNA to structurally deform for passage through the NT.

2. Methods We have used molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate the structure and counter ion interactions of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) confined inside hydrophobic nanotubes modeled by a non-polarizable, single-walled carbon nanotube (NT). We studied a total of five systems: an unenclosed dsDNA (the control) and each combination of an 8 base pair DNA oligomer (5 0 ∞ GACATAGC-3 0 ) inside 30 and 40 A diameter nanotubes with all the sodium counter ions either inside or outside the nanotube. All molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the program CHARMM [10] at constant temperature and pressure (300 K, 1 atm) [11]. B-form DNA was inserted into solvated nanotubes ∞ with inside diameters of 30 and 40 A. Both nanotubes ∞ in length. The initial cell were approximately 60 A ∞ ∞ dimensions were 60 ∑ 60 ∑ 110 A3 and 70 ∑ 70 ∑ 110 A3 ∞ (36 500 atoms) and 40 A (49 900 atoms) ∞ for the 30 A nanotubes, respectively. The TIP3P water model was used [12]. The atoms of the nanotube were fixed during the simulations and had no charge [13]. The nanotube atoms used the aromatic carbon van der Waals parameters in CHARMM [14] and the DNA used the new parameter set (version 27) for nucleic acids [15]. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds containing hydrogens [16]. Electrostatic interactions were treated ∞ using particle mesh Ewald summation with a 10 A cutoff ∞ and a 1.0 A grid [17]. A timestep of 1.25 fs was used. The nonbonded interactions were updated every 10 steps, and no constraints were placed on the DNA. A number of studies have addressed the question of simulation timescales necessary for the structural relaxation of DNA. In a comprehensive MD study of over 100 different DNA sequences, Beveridge et al. [18] found that DNA structural parameters were fully converged in the first 3≠5 ns with some properties converging more rapidly. The timescale of our MD simulations was limited by the ‘metastability’ of the systems with the ions excluded from the NT. Since no structural constraints were placed on the molecules, the DNA could drift out of the NT and this occurred in less than 1 ns for approximately half of the simulations where the ions ∞ were excluded from the 30 A NT. Note that simulations where the DNA left the NT were not included in the analysis and that all other systems were stable on the timescale simulated. Following earlier studies of dynamical processes in DNA that used multiple replicates of relatively short MD runs (e.g., Cheatham and Kollman’s [19] simulations of the A- to B-form DNA transition), we have run four 1 ns replicate simulations for each system with each replicate simulation generated from the same starting coordinates but using a different seed value for assigning initial velocities to the atoms. Addition∞ ally, the system with DNA in a 30 A NT with the counter ions on the outside was simulated for six addi-

tional runs, and one each of the simulations with the ∞ ions inside or outside the 30 A NT was extended for an additional nanosecond. In all simulations the RMSD deviations from canonical B-form converged within ∞ 200 ps (with the exception of the 30 A NT with the counter ions on the outside, see below) and remained stable over the remaining 800 ps and were in good agreement between the replicate runs.

3. Results and discussion We have measured the structural effects of NT confinement on the DNA by calculating the RMS deviation of the DNA structures from the same DNA sequence in the canonical A- and B-forms. Fig. 1 plots the averaged RMSD from the canonical B-form DNA versus simulation time for all systems run. This plot shows several interesting features. First, for the DNA≠NT systems with the ions located inside the NT, the RMSD with respect to B-DNA is similar to that for the DNA control, ∞ averaging about 2 A (2.06 ± 0.16, 2.19 ± 0.18, ∞ , for the control DNA, the 30 A DNA≠ ∞ 2.08 ± 0.27 A ∞ DNA≠NT systems, respectively). NT, and the 40 A Above 900 ps, the RMSD for the DNA with the ions in∞ ∞ side the 40 A NT rises above 2.5 A, but this is due to a very large structural fluctuation in just one of the four replicate simulations. These results show that confinement of the DNA with its counter ions does not lead to a large overall change in the DNA secondary structure, despite a large shift in the counter ion distribution ∞ (see below). Extending a 30 A DNA≠NT simulation for an additional nanosecond did not significantly change the RMSD of the DNA. The average RMSD from ∞ 1 to 2 ns was 2.32 ± 0.21 A. The increased RMSD was due to fraying at the 3 0 end of the DNA. The exclusion of ions from the NT leads to much larger deviations in the DNA secondary structure. For the ∞ DNA in the 40 A NT, the exclusion of counter ions

∞ leads to a structure with an average RMSD 2.45 A with ∞ with respect to A-DNA. respect to B-DNA and 3.12 A ∞ For the DNA in the 30 A NT the effect of excluding the counter ions is much greater, leading to final ∞ RMSDs of greater than 4.0 and 3.5 A with respect to both B- and A-form DNA, and in several replicate simulations, having a characteristic bend in the DNA helix ∞ (see below). In the extended simulation of the 30 A NT with ions out, both ends of the DNA began to fray but all the other bases remained paired. Fig. 2a shows the cumulative probability of finding a sodium ion at a specific distance from a phosphate phosphorus. The plot shows the average of four replicas of the MD simulations, for the unenclosed DNA and the ∞ DNA with ions inside the 30 and 40 A nanotubes. These three systems have distinctly different ion distributions. ∞ The most highly constricted DNA in the 30 A NT shows ∞ to a 20% probability, indicating a sharp step at 3.5 A that 1/5 of the phosphates are directly coordinated by ∞ a sodium ion. For the DNA in the 40 A NT, 10% of the phosphates are directly coordinated by a sodium

ion, compared to only about 5% for the unenclosed DNA. Though the effective molarity of the counter ions near the DNA significantly increases, there is little effect on the secondary structure of the DNA. Although the systems with the ions excluded are hypothetical constructs meant to provide insight into DNA≠NT interactions (since the artificial exclusion of the ions from the NT yields a high-energy, non-equilibrium system), it is nevertheless interesting to look at the counter ion distributions in these systems. When they are excluded from the NT containing the DNA, the counter ions do not cluster near the outside surface of the nanotube. Rather, they form a shell near the surface of the periodic simu∞ lation box. In the 30 A NT simulations, less than 10% ∞ of the sodium ions are within 7 A of the outer surface ∞ of the NT, less than 33% within 10 A, 56% within ∞ . The remaining 44% of the counter ions are in 14 A the remaining volume of the box (which has a ∞ ∞ 60 A ∑ 60 A cross-section). The number of water molecules (hydration number) around the DNA is affected by NT encapsulation (Fig. ∞ 2b). The average hydration number within 10 A of a phosphorous atom of DNA in free solution is 118. There is a slight reduction in the hydration number for the DNA ∞ in a 40 A NT to 101. There is a significant drop in the ∞ hydration number for DNA inside the 30 A NT. The average hydration number is 78 around the phosphorous atoms of DNA. The hydration number does not vary significantly if the counter ions are inside or outside the ∞ nanotube. For the case of the 30 A NT with the ions excluded, the lower hydration around the phosphates and the lack of counter ions does have a long-range effect on the orientation of the surrounding waters. Waters around the phosphates have their dipole moment directed ∞ towards these charged groups at a distance well past 7 A from the phosphates. A similar but slightly less dramatic ∞ long range water correlation was seen for the 40 A NT simulation with the ions excluded. No such long range water orientation was seen for the simulations of the unenclosed DNA or the systems with ions inside the NT. We investigated the effect of NT confinement on the RMS fluctuations of each atom in the DNA sequences. These RMS fluctuations were calculated over the last 500 ps of the simulations and averaged over the four replicates. (From this average RMS fluctuation, for each DNA≠NT simulation we calculated the atom-by-atom ratio of the RMS fluctuations with respect to the corresponding atom in the DNA control to yield a ratio that when <1 indicates decreased thermal fluctuation due to confinement and when >1 indicates increased thermal ∞ fluctuations.) For the DNA in the 40 A NT, this ratio varies from 0.77 to 1.16 for different atoms, with an average of 0.97 ± 0.07, indicating little effect of NT confinement on the DNA thermal fluctuations. In contrast, ∞ the ratio for the DNA confined within the 30 A NT ranged from 0.67 to 1.87, with an average of

0.88 ± 0.16, indicating an average overall decrease in the thermal motion of the DNA. However, the RMS fluctuations ratios show an increased range because the termi∞ nal residues of the DNA confined in the 30 A NT showed increased fluctuations; end fraying was more ∞ pronounced in the 30 A NT simulations than in the ∞ NT confined DNA. In simulaDNA control or 40 A tions with frayed ends, the free base can adhere to the side of the NT. Once the base adheres the NT, it does not detach during the simulation. The simulations of the DNA≠NT systems with the ions excluded from the NT yielded the most significant perturbations to the DNA structure. Interestingly, in five out of nine of the simulations of the DNA in the ∞ 30 A NT with the ions excluded, the DNA adopted a characteristic bend that was very nearly superimposeable for all cases (Fig. 3a). The DNA molecules had bend angles ranging from 42∞ to 89∞. The DNA bases remain paired despite this severe bending. By comparison in the non-encapsulated, solvated DNA, the DNA bending ranged from 17∞ to 26∞. The structural features of the DNA bending were similar in all cases. The minor ∞ groove of the DNA widens to 10 A to expose the bases, the major groove narrows, and the DNA bends towards the major groove. This change in DNA confor∞ mation exposes approximately 100 A2 more solvent accessible surface area relative to the DNA structure from the control simulations. The bending of the DNA is very rapid. In each simulation where bending occurs there is an initial transition from B-form to Aform DNA followed by the structures bending before 300 ps and reaching close to the maximum bend angle by 500 ps and persists for the duration of the simulation (Fig. 3b). Although the change in the DNA structure is dramatic and rapid, similar transitions have been observed in other molecular dynamics simulations. Cheetham and Kollman observed an A-form to B-form transition in multiple simulations of a DNA decamer ∞ [19]. An 6 A RMSD change occurred in those simulations within approximately 500 ps (the total length of those simulations were less than 1.5 ns apiece). This result is particularly intriguing because of previous experimental and theoretical evidence for structurally similar bending of DNA near hydrophobic surfaces. Crystallographic structures of DNA bound to the TATA box binding protein (TBP), that acts to initiate eukaryotic RNA polymerization, showed that the DNA had an 80∞ bend in the seven bases within the TBP recognition site and also underwent a 117∞ unwinding in these seven bases [20≠22]. Fig. 3a shows a superposition of the three bent structures observed for the ∞ DNA in the 30 A NT with the ions excluded on the crystallographic structure of the TBP-bound DNA. An earlier simulation study by Elcock and McCammon [23] investigated the effect of a generic hydrophobic protein surface on DNA structure in implicit solvent and found

that the approach of a hydrophobic surface induced bending of the DNA away from the surface. Similarly, in our simulations the DNA bends away from the closest NT wall. Although it would be expected that the less polar bases of the nucleic acids would be interacting with the hydrophobic NT, this does not occur in the simulations. Several backbone phosphates are in contact with the NT, and the solvent exposed minor groove is close to the center of the tube but distant from the NT walls (Fig. 4). The average intrastrand separation of ∞ the phosphorous atoms is 6.56 ± 0.46 A which is intermediate between the average distance found in B-form and A-form DNA. At their closest interaction, the phosphates are in direct contact with the NT without any intervening water. The intrastrand separation of the phosphorous atoms in contact with the NT was greater ∞ than 7 A. The reduced solvation of the phosphates in contact with the NT likely makes a major contribution to the observed DNA bending. Recently, a combined neutron scattering and molecular dynamics study of an open-ended SWNT showed water molecules to be ordered along the interior surface of the NT enclosing a fluid chain of waters [24]. Analysis ∞ of the 30 and 40 A simulations showed a single layer of ordered water on the interior surface of the nanotubes. Fig. 5a and b show representations of the number density for the oxygen atom of water within the NT during ∞ one of the 30 A ions inside simulations. The ordering of ∞ the water in 30 A nanotubes is not affected by the presence or absence of sodium ions. This single ordered layer of water encases the DNA and must be the reason for ∞ the reduced fluctuations in the 30 A NT simulations. Many of the water molecules lay flat across the surface of the NT forming water chains (Fig. 5c). This flattening of the water molecules is commonly seen in hydrophobic ∞ hydration [13,24]. The ordering of the water in the 40 A NT does not significantly affect the DNA since there is a mobile layer of water around the DNA.

In summary, the structural effects of hydrophobic NT confinement on double helical DNA were studied by molecular dynamics. For systems with sodium included inside the NT, there is little effect on the DNA structure relative to unconfined DNA. Exclusion of sodium from the NT leads to structures that deviate from both canonical A- and B-DNA.
