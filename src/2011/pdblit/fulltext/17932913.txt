ABSTRACT Mimotopes mimic the three-dimensional topology of an antigen epitope, and are frequently recognized by antibodies with affinities comparable to those obtained for the original antibody­antigen interaction. Peptides and anti-idiotypic antibodies are two classes of protein mimotopes that mimic the topology (but not necessarily the sequence) of the parental antigen. In this study, we combine these two classes by selecting mimotopes based on single domain IgNAR antibodies, which display exceptionally long CDR3 loop regions (analogous to a constrained peptide library) presented in the context of an immunoglobulin framework with adjacent and supporting CDR1 loops. By screening an in vitro phage-display library of IgNAR variable domains (VNARs) against the target antigen monoclonal antibody MAb5G8, we obtained four potential mimotopes. MAb5G8 targets a linear tripeptide epitope (AYP) in the flexible signal sequence of the Plasmodium falciparum Apical Membrane Antigen--1 (AMA1), and this or similar motifs were detected in the CDR loops of all four VNARs. The VNARs, 1-A-2, 27, 211, and 214, were demonstrated to bind specifically to this paratope by competition studies with an artificial peptide and all showed enhanced affinities (3­46 nM) compared to the parental antigen (175 nM). Crystallographic studies of recombinant proteins 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 showed that the SYP motifs on these VNARs presented at the tip of the exposed CDR3 loops, ideally positioned within bulge-like structures to make contact with the MAb5G8 antibody. These loops, in particular in 1-A-11, were further stabilized by inter- and intra- loop disulphide bridges, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and aromatic residue packing. We rationalize the higher affinity of the VNARs compared to the parental antigen by suggesting that adjacent CDR1 and framework resi-

dues contribute to binding affinity, through interactions with other CDR regions on the antibody, though of course definitive support of this hypothesis will rely on co-crystallographic studies. Alternatively, the selection of mimotopes from a large (<4 3 108) constrained library may have allowed selection of variants with even more favorable epitope topologies than present in the original antigenic structure, illustrating the power of in vivo selection of mimotopes from phage-displayed molecular libraries.

INTRODUCTION The vertebrate immune system possesses an almost limitless capacity to recognize and neutralize foreign antigens through selection and affinity maturation of highly specific antibody molecules.1 Structurally, antibodies consist of paired heavy and light chains, and the antigenbinding region, termed the paratope, is formed from up to six proteinaceous complementarity determining region loops (CDRs) displayed three each at the top of the variable heavy and variable light immunoglobulin domains.2 The binding between paratope and antigenic epitope is mediated through a combination of noncovalent bonds (hydrogen bond, salt bridge, hydrophobic, etc.) and shape and charge complementarity interaction3­5 which

are usually both highly specific and exquisitely sensitive.6 However the resultant affinity-matured antibody may be less than antigen-specific because immune selection is essentially a stochastic process, sampling and selection from an extensive range of possible CDR loop sequences and combinations. For example, antigenic cross-reactivity has been implicated in diseases and auto-immune condi´ tions such as Guillain-Barre,7 Chagas8 and in immunemediated (Type 1) diabetes.9,10 Mimotopes are further examples of this antibody cross-reactivity. These are typically linear peptide mimics of an antigenic epitope, and are specifically recognized by the paratope of an individual monoclonal antibody.11­14 Such mimotopes do not usually contain the precise sequence that represents the epitope and may be structurally distinct from the original epitope. However, they are functionally very similar and thereby capable of mimicking the three-dimensional conformational features of both linear and conformational epitopes in order to bind with potentially higher affinity to the paratope.15­17 Mimotopes can be identified through screening of bacteriophage-displayed libraries of random peptides against a monoclonal antibody target. This approach has the advantage that no structural data is required for the target antigen, and the resultant mimotopes find utility as probes for the detection of antibodies produced during infection, for example on solid phases to capture, detect, and quantify the desired target polypeptide in complex biological mixtures.18­23 Additionally, mimotopes have been used in vaccine design as immunogens to induce an immune response mimicking that raised against an immunodominant epitope of the parental antigen24­28 and in protein engineering as novel peptidomimetics.29,30 Mimotopes are classically defined as peptides. However, the existence of idiotype- anti-idiotypic antibody pairs extends this concept to recognition of an antibody conformational paratope by a second antibody. This is achieved through immunisation using a monoclonal antibody as immunogen, and generation of a secondary (anti-idiotypic) antibody which recognizes the specific CDR loop regions of the paratope, rather than the underlying and conserved immunoglobulin framework. Anti-idiotypic antibodies have been hypothesized to play a role in immune-regulation,31,32 have provided many important biological insights, and been utilized as novel detection reagents of disease states33,34 or for example as treatments for hypo-allergenic conditions.35,36 One antibody variant which combines features of both constrained peptides and conventional antibody structures is the unique IgNAR isotype found in the serum of sharks.37­39 IgNARs are heavy-chain homodimers that lack associated light chains.38 The individual variable domains (VNARs) within each homodimer are independent in solution, and do not associate across a hydrophobic interface, either with each other or with light chain variable regions,40,41 in marked contrast to the VH-VL

conformation found in conventional antibodies. Since VNAR domains bind antigen through only one immunoglobulin domain ($13 kDa) their antigen-binding paratope is drastically reduced in terms of CDR loop number. Indeed, IgNAR structural studies by our laboratory and others have shown that antigen binding is mediated predominantly through the extended CDR3 loop regions, which are on average 16­18 residues in length (though examples up to 23 residues have been observed), forming an extended paratope ideal for targeting for example enzyme active sites and cleft-type epitopes. This structure in effect represents a constrained peptide, with loop stability imparted by internal hydrogen bond networks, and stabilizing disulphide linkages to the CDR1 loop or to adjacent framework regions37,42,43 (SN unpublished results). Important contributions to the VNAR paratope also come from the CDR1, heavy loop 4, and framework residues.37,44 Unlike conventional antibodies, VNAR domains have no distinctive CDR2 loop supporting the CDR1 and CDR3 regions, and in this sense they more closely resemble the class of I-set immunoglobulins.37,43 The monoclonal antibody MAb5G8 recognizes a linear epitope within the pro-domain of apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1), a leading vaccine protein from the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum.18,45 Generation of peptide mimotopes from bacteriophage-display peptide libraries has previously narrowed the epitope to the 76 AYP sequence, with significant cross-reactivity observed for the tripeptide SYP.45 The high frequency of these related sequences in randomly generated bacteriophagebased libraries makes this an ideal model system both for validation of such molecular libraries and the testing of paratope-mimotope interactions. Thus, in this study we have panned a shark VNAR-based library against MAb5G8 and isolated four related families of immunoglobulin mimotopes. We compare their binding affinities with that of native antigen, and correlate the crystallographic structures of two of these VNAR mimotopes with their binding efficiencies, in order to refine our understanding of the IgNAR binding interface.

E. coli strains

Expression of VNAR proteins

The cell line used for library propagation, selection and protein expression was E. coli TG1 (K12 supE D(lacproAB) thi hsdD 5 F'{traD36 proAB1 lacIqlacZDM15}. E. coli transformants were maintained and grown in 2xYT broth supplemented with 100 lg/mL ampicillin Æ2% (w/v) glucose. Solid media contained 2% (w/v) Bacto-agar. Transformation of E. coli was by standard procedures46 performed using electro-competent cells.
Bacteriophage library construction and panning

Construction of the VNAR library has been described previously.39,40 Phagemid particles incorporating the VNAR-gIII/protein fusion were propagated and isolated according to standard procedures47 except for the use of M13 hyperphage (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, GmbH) during propagation. For biopanning of the library, murine monoclonal MAb5G8 IgG (IgG1 j) was coated onto Maxisorp Immunotubes overnight at 48C at a concentration of 2.5 lg/mL in 1xPBS for the initial pan and 0.625 lg/mL in 1xPBS for all subsequent pans. Prior to bio-panning rounds 2­4, purified bacteriophages were also pre-adsorbed against immunotubes coated with 2% skim milk powder in 1xPBS prior to addition to antigencoated tubes. Immunotubes were rinsed (1xPBS), blocked with 2% skim milk powder (Diploma, Australia) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature (RT) then incubated with prepared phagemid particles for 30 min at RT with gentle agitation followed by 90 min equilibration at RT without agitation. Immunotubes were then washed 10 to 20 times in 1xPBS/0.05% Tween-20 followed by an identical set of washes with 1xPBS. Phagemid particles were eluted using 1% ethanolamine, pH 11, neutralised by the addition of 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and stored at 48C.
Nucleic acid isolation and cloning

Recombinant proteins were synthesised in E. coli TG1 bacterial cells and transported to the periplasm as described previously.49,50 Bacterial periplasmic fractions were isolated through the method of Minsky51 and either utilized as a crude fraction or purified by affinity chromatographic techniques using an anti-FLAG antibody-Sepharose column (10 3 1 cm). The affinity column was equilibrated with 1xPBS, pH 7.4, and bound protein was eluted with ImmunoPureTM gentle elution buffer (Pierce, USA). Eluted protein was dialyzed against three changes of 1xPBS/0.02% sodium azide and concentrated by ultrafiltration over a 3kDa cutoff membrane (YM3, Diaflo). Samples were analyzed by gel filtration size exclusion chromatography (FPLC) on a pre-calibrated Superdex75 column (Pharmacia, Sweden) in PBS pH 7.4 and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 12.5 or 15% Tris/glycine gels.

ELISA assays

Phagemid particles were infected into E. coli TG1 cells and propagated as plasmids to enable plasmid DNA isolation. The DNA encoding the VNAR domains was extracted by NotI/SfiI restriction endonuclease digestion and subcloned into similarly digested vector pGC.48 DNA from isolated plasmid clones were sequenced on both strands using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturers specifications at the Australian Genome Research Facility. Nucleotide sequences associated with this study have been lodged with the Genbank database (1-A-2: EF064153; 1-A-7: DQ269922; 1-A-11: DQ269923; 1-A-14: EF064154).

Monoclonal 5G8 IgG antigen or negative control proteins (BSA, a-amylase, lysozyme) were coated onto Maxisorb Immuno-plates (Nunc, Germany) at concentrations of 0.2­0.5 lg/well in PBS and incubated at 48C overnight. Plates were then rinsed, blocked with PBS/5% blocking agent (Blotto, BSA or casein) for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated with periplasmic extracts or purified protein for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were rinsed with 1xPBS, washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20, and incubated with a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate antibody (SigmaAldrich, USA) (1/1000 in PBS/respective blocking agent) to detect bound VNAR protein. Plates were incubated and washed as above, before developing with 2,2 azino di(ethyl) benzothiazoline sulphonic acid (ABTS; Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and read at A405 nm. ELISA assays using whole phage particles were performed as above, with phage particles ($1.0 3 1012) from sequential panning rounds tested for binding to antigen and bound phage detected using an anti-M13 MAb HRP-conjugate (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden).

Competitive peptide ELISAs

Dilutions of peptide E2 derived from the parental antigen (NEDENTLQHAYPIDC) were added to purified VNAR protein (2.0 lg) prior to addition of the mix to ELISA plates coated with MAb5G8. Assays were performed as described above for ELISA assays, using an anti-FLAG M2 peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to detect bound IgNAR protein.

Biosensor binding analysis

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed using a Biacore T100 biosensor system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). CM5 sensor chips, 10xHBSEP1 buffer, rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody, amine coupling kit containing 1-Ethyl 3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 1M ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5 were obtained from Biacore AB (Sweden). All experiments were performed at 258C using a continuous flow in filtered 1xHBS-EP1 buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% surfactant P-20, pH 7.4). Analysis of the interaction between the VNAR proteins and MAb5G8 IgG was carried out using an indirect assay where MAb5G8 IgG was captured onto a sensor chip surface via a rabbit anti-mouse (RAM) IgG antibody. A standard coupling protocol was employed to immobilize the RAM IgG antibody via exposed primary amines52 in two separate flow cells (1 and 2). ``Aim-for-immobilizedlevel'' wizard template (Biacore T100 Control software, v1.1) was utilized for the two separate immobilizations. Briefly, the carboxyl groups on the sensor surface in flow cell 1 (reference surface) and 2 were activated by a 7-min injection (10 lL/min) of a freshly prepared 1:1 200 mM EDC:50 mM NHS solution. Small volumes (1­10 lL) of RAM IgG (30 lg/mL, 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0) were then automatically injected at 5 lg/min until immobilization of $2000 RU of antibody was achieved. The immobilization procedure was completed by a 7-min injection (10 lL/min) of 1M ethanolamine (pH 8.5) to deactivate residual reactive sites. MAb5G8 IgG samples (20 lg/mL) were injected for 3 min at a flow rate of 5 lL/min over the RAM IgG surface in flow cell 2 resulting in a capture of $280 RU of monoclonal antibody. VNAR proteins spanning 2.5­160 nM in concentration were injected serially over the antibody and reference surfaces at a flow-rate of 30 lL/min. Association and dissociation phases were each monitored for 5 min (300 s) and at least one buffer only injection identical to VNAR injections was included for doublereferencing. Both VNAR and MAb5G8 IgG surfaces were regenerated with a single 45-s injection of 10 mM Glycine pH 1.5. To determine the kinetic parameters of the interactions, each data set was double-referenced and fit globally to a 1:1 interaction model (Biacore T100 Evaluation software, v1.1).

Data collection and structure determination

X-ray data from crystals were measured using Rigaku RAXIS IV (Rigaku-MSC, Tokyo) and Mar 180 (MARResearch, Germany) image plate detectors mounted on a Rigaku HR3 HB X-ray generator equipped with monocapillary focusing optics (AXCO, Parkville, Australia). Diffraction data were collected at 21608C (the crystals were cryoprotected using their respective initial crystallization solutions with the addition of 10% glycerol (v/v)) and processed by using the DENZO/SCALEPAC suite. Structures were determined by molecular replacement using CCP4 MOLREP. The structure of VNAR molecules previously described43 were used as partial frameworks without CDR3 regions to model the structure of the isolated VNARs. RESULTS

Crystallisation

Recombinant IgNARs 1-A-7 (13 mg/mL) and 1-A-11 (4 mg/mL) were purified as above, and set up as 0.2 lL sitting drops in a 960-condition crystallisation trial using a Cartesian Honey Bee robot. Plates were incubated at 258C. Successful conditions were scaled up to 2 lL hanging drops. Final crystallization conditions were 0.1M Ace-

A recombinant VNAR single domain antibody library (>4 3 108 clones), encoding extensive CDR3 loop diversity, was selected by multiple rounds of bacteriophage panning against monoclonal antibody MAb5G8 coated on the surface of immunotubes. During successive rounds of panning, washing stringency was increased while simultaneously decreasing the concentration of target and employing a pre-adsorption step, in order to bias selection toward high-affinity binding domains and remove non-antigen-specific isolates. Following four rounds of selection, an increase in bacteriophage titres was observed, suggesting positive enrichment within the population. ELISA analysis of pools of phage clones derived from each panning round indicated an increase in MAb5G8-specific clones compared to negative control antigen [Fig. 1(A)]. Pools of phage clones did not bind an idiotype matched monoclonal antibody suggesting that this positive selection was not targeting the conserved murine antibody framework (results not shown). To further analyze these potential mimotopes, VNAR coding regions were isolated from the fourth round phage pool and cloned into the bacterial vector pGC for small-scale protein expression. Following preliminary ELISA analysis (results not shown), those clones reactive to MAb5G8 could be divided into four families, represented by the IgNARs 1-A-2, 1-A-7, 1-A-11; and 1-A-14. Natural binding affinity of MAb5G8 encompasses the immunodominant epitope 76AYP within the AMA1 protein, with wobble at the first position allowing interaction with peptides encoding close variants such as SYP.45 Analysis of the sequences of the IgNARs isolated in this

study showed typical VNAR domains, containing minor variations within their frameworks and highly variable CDR regions [Fig. 1(B)]. Further analysis of the CDR3 loop regions indicated that both 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 display the linear motif NYSYP, while the similar motif N SYY is present in clone 1-A-14 [Fig. 1(C)]. In contrast, the clone 1-A-2 CDR3 displayed no readily identifiable sequence motif of the type implicated in MAb5G8 binding. However, examination of the CDR1 regions of both clones 1-A-2 and 1-A-14 revealed the presence of the motif NYGL which may alternatively mediate the interaction of the IgNAR with MAb5G8 through the surface exposed CDR1 loop region [Fig. 1(C)]. No similar motifs, either in CDR1 or CDR3 regions, were observed in round 4 selected clones which were negative for MAb5G8 binding by ELISA (results not shown).

To further analyze this set of mimotopes, VNAR domains 1-A-2, 27, 211, and 214 were produced as affinity-purified recombinant proteins. All proteins were efficiently expressed in E. coli, and were purified from the periplasmic space through dual C-terminal FLAG affinity tag epitopes (yields 0.8 mg/L­1.9 mg/L). Gel filtration analysis showed mixtures of monomeric and dimeric species, which eluted from the column at slightly different times dependent upon the variant, consistent with previous IgNAR VNAR protein expression profiles (Supplementary Fig. 1).49 In a series of ELISA experiments, the binding of recombinant VNAR to MAb5G8 was confirmed, while insignificant reactivity was observed to a murine IgG1 isotype control (monoclonal antibody 3-2G12), indicating that binding to MAb5G8 was paratope-specific. To more conclusively demonstrate that the VNAR mimotopes were interacting with the MAb5G8 paratope, a series of competition ELISA experiments were performed using the 13 residue MAb5G8-specific E2 peptide (NEDENTLQHAYPIDC). This peptide was previously demonstrated to interact specifically with the MAb5G8 binding site and to mimic the native AMA1 antigen.45 Upon addition of peptide E2, binding of recombinant VNAR proteins 1-A-2, 27, 211, and 214 were all inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, with 1-A-14 exhibiting the lowest response during the assay. In contrast, a synthetic control peptide had no significant inhibitory affect on binding [Fig. 2(A)]. To more fully analyze the IgNAR-MAb5G8 interactions, a series of BIAcore biosensor studies was undertaken. A sensor chip conjugated with a rabbit anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (RAM surface) was used for immobilisation of MAb5G8. This conformation results in presentation of the MAb5G8 variable domain away from the biosensor surface, ideally oriented to interact at 1:1 stoichiometry with the VNAR analyte. Isolated monomeric VNAR variable domains bound immobilized antibody in 1:1 stoichiometric ratios, in good agreement with theoretical models [Fig. 2(B­E)]. A comparison of the relative association and dissociation constants indicates that these final affinities comprise varying on- and off- rate kinetics indicating different patterns of association (Table I). Relative affinities (KD) in decreasing order are 1-A-11 (3 nM) > 1-A-2 (6 nM) > 1-A-7 (19 nM) > 1-A-14 (46 nM) (Table I). No background binding was observed in this system for a nonrelated IgNAR antibody (results not shown), and all affinities are superior to the parental MAb5G8--AMA1 interaction, measured at KD 5 175 nM [Table I; Fig. 2(F)].

Recombinant proteins were purified from the E. coli periplasmic space and set up individually as 0.2 lL sitting drops under 960-conditions utilizing a Cartesian Honey Bee robotic crystallization robot. Several potential crystal leads were observed for 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 over a period of 10­20 days, and lead conditions were successfully scaled up in 2 lL hanging drops, providing diffraction quality crystals for both 1-A-7 (10 days; 0.1M Acetate pH 4.6 20% PEP (17/8 PO/OH)) and 1-A11 (30 days; 0.1M Cacodylate pH 6.5 36% MPEG2000. No crystal leads were observed over the course of 20 weeks for either 1-A-2 or 1-A-14 proteins. The three-dimensional crystal structures of 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 were determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP53 of the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4),54 with VNAR 12Y-1 (PDB: 1VER) as the search model without CDR3 region, and ° ° refined with REFMAC555 to 2.7 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively (Table II). Water molecules were added automatically with the program ARP56 and revised with XTALVIEW.57 The water molecules were retained if they satisfied hydrogen bonding criteria and if their 2mjFojDjFcj electron density maps were confirmed after the refinement. Progress of the refinement was monitored using the Rfree statistic based on a set encompassing $10 and 5% of the 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 observed diffraction amplitudes, respectively. For the 1-A-7 structure, four monomers (A, B, C, and D) were identified within the asymmetric unit of the P212121 space group. They form two dimers (A-B and C-D) similar to those previously observed in the VNAR domains 12Y-1 and 12Y-2.43 Itera-

was present in the asymmetric unit of the C2 space group; a representative sample of electron density is shown [Fig. 3(C)]. Following the convergence in standard REFMAC5 refinement of the 1-A-7 structure, a further improvement of R factors was achieved by refining all four chains as separate rigid anisotropic domains with the TLS procedure.59 The libration tensor showed significant anisotropy. In total, 90.8/93.8% of 1-A-7/1-A-11 residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, with 9.2/ 4.1% residues in the additionally allowed regions. The 1A-7 final model comprises four chains with 113 residues each and 356 waters and the 1-A-11 final model comprises one chain with 111 residues and 119 waters. Further details are presented in Table II, and coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession codes 2YWY (1-A-7) and 2YWZ (1-A-11).

tive model building and refinement with XTALVIEW and REFMAC5 allowed a complete trace of the A, B, C, and D chains, however only the extended CDR3 loops of chains A and C were visible in the final structure [Fig. 3(A)]. The electron density was reasonably well defined in these CDR3 loop regions as shown by a representative sample of electron density [Fig. 3(B)]. For 1-A-11, one monomer

Consistent with other Type 2 VNAR structures, there is high homology between the conserved 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 Ig superfamily fold framework regions, with a R.M.S.D. ° of 0.941 A for 105 atoms for these two structures [Fig. 3(D); Supplementary Figs. 2, 3]. In contrast, VNAR antibody diversity and antigen binding is concentrated in the CDR loops. Thus, we analyzed these regions in our structures in order to dissect the relationship between their loop topologies and ability to function as mimotopes. For protein 1-A-11, a CDR1--CDR3 disulphide bond links residues Cys29 and Cys91, a similar linkage is observed in $2/3 of VNARs derived from the shark immune repertoire. In addition to providing stability for the extended CDR3 region, this disulphide bond brings the two loop structures close together and locks the CDR3 in

a more upright position than is observed for other VNARs where no such linkage is present [Fig. 4(A). This difference is most marked when comparing the Type 1 VNAR where laterally positioned framework cysteine residues mediate disulphide linkages which pull the CDR3 loop to the side of the molecule [Fig. 4(A); nurse shark VNAR]. The CDR3 structures of both 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 exhibit flat opened loops, at least in these crystallographic forms, with internal stability of the CDR3 foot provided by the rigid stacking of hydrophobic side-chains, for example

from residues Ala85 to Ser88 and Ile98 to Gly100 for 1-A-7. However lack of further interactions of the tip (aa 89­ 98) of CDR3 with the rest of the 1-A-7 protein leads to high mobility of this region preventing its reliable modeling into the electron density for chains B and D. These chains do not have any intermolecular contacts in the crystal structure. However, in chains A and C the CDR3 is stabilized by interchain contacts between these two chains. The contact area for 89­98 residues of chain A or ° C of 416 A2 (estimated with CCP4 AREAIMOL program

° with probe sphere radius 1.7 A) is 40% of the total con° tact area (1040 A2) between chains A and C. A further examination of the two CDR3 loop structures indicates that the putative mimotope sequences are oriented in outward-pointing bulges [Fig. 4(B,D)]. In both cases, these bulges are oriented away from the adjacent CDR1 loop, which would otherwise sterically interfere with the MAb5G8-IgNAR interaction [Fig. 4(C,E)]. Additionally, for 1-A-7 chains A and C the internal packing of aromatic residues Phe87, Tyr94, and Pro99 may provide further structural stability by locking of the CDR3 tip through a network of hydrogen bonds in addition to hydrophobic interactions. The 1-A-7 CDR1 residues also contribute to the overall loop conformation through (1) the positively charged side-chain of Arg33 which contacts a hydrophobic pocket at the base of the CDR3 loop; and (2) through contact between charged residues Glu32, Asp30, and Asp29 and polar CDR3 residues. The overall affect of these interactions appears to be to lock the 1-A7 CDR3 in an upright orientation, analogous to the role played by the 1-A-11 inter-CDR disulphide bond.

DISCUSSION Traditionally, antibody mimotopes have been derived from two sources. First, from peptide libraries of random sequence, panned against antibodies in order to mimic and identify the native epitope by correlation with the original antigen sequence.13,39 This approach has additionally provided immunodominant peptides, suitable for immunization protocols provoking an in vivo immune response mimicking that produced by inoculation with the parent antigen. The second generic type of mimotope is the anti-idiotypic antibody, a naturally derived antibody raised in vivo against an antibody as immunogen.31,60 For specificity and use as an immunogen, the immune response must recognize the conformation of specific CDR loops, and not the underlying framework. The generation of idiotype-anti-idiotype pairs has previously been restricted to in vivo immunisation strategies. Two recent reports describe the isolation of scFv61 and Fab62 fragments from nonimmunized libraries using antibody library panning and selection methods. To our knowledge however, this is the first reported in vitro isolation of anti-idiotypic single domain antibodies from a nonimmunized synthetic antibody library. The VNAR mimotopes that we describe in this study fall between the two types of mimotopes described above. On the one hand, the VNAR variable domains are dominated by an extended CDR3 loop, with an average length of 16­18 residues (compared to 10­13 residues for murine and human antibodies)63). This one loop represents close to 20% of the protein surface, and in this respect, the VNAR paratope can be regarded as a constrained single peptide library. Conversely, VNARs are true antibodies,

albeit of the single domain variety,64 and studies by us and others have demonstrated that antigen recognition is mediated through both CDR1 and CDR3 and framework regions,37,65 SN unpublished data). Thus, while the mimotopes reported here were not produced by animal immunization, they were selected in vitro from an antibody library in a process designed to mimic the natural antigen-driven process. From this perspective they clearly resemble idiotype- anti-idiotype pairs. To rationalize these scenarios, and to more closely dissect the relative contributions of the varying IgNAR regions to binding the target MAb5G8, we analyzed the possible mimotope sequences in the context of their crystallographic structures. We successfully identified two potential mimotope motifs in VNARs 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 which map to exposed bulge regions at the top of the respective CDR3 loops. The highly exposed conformations of these motifs are maintained by patterns of loop packing based around aromatic residues, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges, and in the case of 1-A-11 an inter-loop disulphide bridge directing the putative mimotope bulge away from the CDR1 loop. In both crystallographic structures, the expected motif (A/S)YP was preceded by conserved tyrosine residues. However, these tyrosine side chains point inward and away from the antigen, thus we suggest that they contribute to bulge formation and stability rather than directly interacting with the MAb5G8 antigen. Unfortunately, no crystallographic structures are available for 1-A-2 and 1-A-14, which showed possible mimotope sequences in both the CDR1 and CDR3 loops. It would be interesting to compare their loop/bulge topologies with those obtained for 1-A-7 and 1-A-11 to see if similar structures were maintained irrespective of the differing primary sequences. The noted absence of sequence similarity to the (A/S)YP consensus epitope in VNARs 1-A-2 (and 1-A-14 to a lesser extent) is puzzling, but it is likely that dissimilar amino acid residues present in either the CDR-1 or 23 are presented in such conformations that they bind the MAb5G8 paratope, as has been previously reported in other systems.66 The formal possibility remains that these may also represent examples of discontinuous mimotopes, where the epitope is formed by several fragments scattered along the protein sequence brought in to close spatial proximity following ternary folding.13 However, given the small size of the initial epitope we believe it to be more likely that the VNAR framework presents continuous portions of the CDR loops, not obvious from the primary sequence, in conformations favorable to binding. The antigen target, MAb5G8, was initially raised against the apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) from Plasmodium falciparum, and targets the AYP motif within the flexible N-terminal signal region of this polymorphic protein.45 We calculated the biosensor affinity of MAb5G8 for the AMA1 protein to be 175 nM, a figure within the biologically useful range but at the lower end

for in vivo affinity matured antibodies. In contrast, the VNAR mimotopes isolated in this study ranged in affinities between 3 nM (1-A-11) and 46 nM (1-A-14). We rationalize these results by suggesting that two factors contribute to significantly enhanced affinities compared to the parent antigen. First, the fairly exposed presentation of the mimotopes sequences by the VNAR discussed above. Second, that additional interactions formed between the MAb5G8 and adjacent secondary IgNAR CDR loops and framework residues contribute to and enhance binding affinity. The buried surface area for antigen-antibody complexes typically occupies upward of ° 800 A2,67 and there is every likelihood that a similar interaction surface occurs for the VNARs described here. Support for this hypothesis will necessarily depend upon co-crystallographic data of VNAR-MAb5G8 complexes, but comparison with the only published VNAR-antigen co-crystallographic complexes, Hel-IgNAR, shows not only the VNAR CDR3 binding within the lysozyme active site, but also extensive CDR1 interactions.37 Interestingly, further studies on this model system also suggest significant flexibility within the CDR3 loop and induction of an ``induced fit'' upon antigen binding.68 Similarly, several co-crystallographic studies between camelid single domain VHH antibodies and their cognate antigens, illustrate CDR, framework and main-chain interactions assuming varying importance dependent upon the nature of the individual antigen.69­71 The ability of our VNAR library to provide mimotopes to antigens such as MAb5G8 means that such antibody libraries will provide valuable resources for future generation and analysis of constrained mimotopes. A comparison of the CDR3 loop structures obtained with those obtained for other VNARs illustrates the wide range of topologies adopted by such extended CDR3 loops, which provide a constellation of conformations for interaction with the paratopes presented by monoclonal antibodies. The position of adjacent CDR1 loops (also variant) means that a more ``conformational'' aspect may be obtained than is seen for single-loop mimotope libraries, more closely approximating to true idiotype-anti-idiotype antibody pairs. This approach also illustrates the potential to utilize scaffold domains as potential mimotopes with affinities in excess of linear peptides for the discovery or display of novel peptides for use as drug discovery tools or for further exploration of protein-protein interactions.
