Background: The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) catalyses the cellular uptake and subsequent phosphorylation of carbohydrates. Moreover, the PTS plays a crucial role in the global regulation of various metabolic pathways. The PTS consists of two general proteins, enzyme I and the histidine-containing protein (HPr), and the carbohydrate-specific enzyme II (EII). EIIs are usually composed of two cytoplasmic domains, IIA and IIB, and a transmembrane domain, IIC. The IIA domains catalyse the transfer of a phosphoryl group from HPr to IIB, which phosphorylates the transported carbohydrate. Knowledge of the structures of the IIA proteins may provide insight into the mechanisms by which the PTS couples phosphorylation reactions with carbohydrate specificity. Results: We have determined the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli mannitol-specific IIA domain, IIAmtl (Mr 16.3 kDa), by multiple anomalous dispersion analysis of a selenomethionine variant of IIAmtl. The structure was refined at 1.8 Å resolution to an R factor of 19.0% (Rfree 24.2%). The enzyme consists of a single five-stranded mixed  sheet, flanked by helices on both sides. The phosphorylation site (His65) is located at the end of the third  strand, in a shallow crevice lined with hydrophobic residues. The sidechains of two conserved active-site residues, Arg49 and His111, adopt two different conformations in the four independent IIAmtl molecules. Using a solution structure of phosphorylated HPr, and a combination of molecular modelling and NMR binding experiments, structural models of the HPr­IIAmtl complex were generated. Conclusions: The fold of IIAmtl is completely different from the structures of other IIA proteins determined so far. The two conformations of Arg49 and His111 might represent different states of the active site, required for the different phosphoryl transfer reactions in which IIAmtl is involved. A comparison of the HPr­IIAmtl model with models of HPr in complex with other IIA enzymes shows that the overall interaction mode between the two proteins is similar. Differences in the stabilisation of the invariant residue Arg17 of HPr by the different IIA proteins might be part of a subtle mechanism to control the hierarchy of carbohydrate utilisation by the bacterium.

Introduction
The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) couples the uptake of carbohydrates with their concurrent phosphorylation [1,2]. In addition, the PTS plays a crucial role in the global regulation of cellular metabolism [3] and is involved in chemotaxis towards PTS substrates [4]. The PTS is composed of three catalytic entities: the two general proteins, enzyme I (EI) and the histidine-containing protein (HPr), and the carbohydrate-specific enzyme

II complex (EII) (Figure 1). Energy to drive the translocation of the carbohydrate is provided by phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP), which is used as a substrate in the autophosphorylation of EI. EI phosphorylates HPr, which in turn transfers the phosphoryl group to the EII complex. On the basis of sequence comparisons, the different EIIs have been grouped in four families [1]: the glucose­ sucrose family, the lactose­cellobiose family, the mannose­ sorbose family and the mannitol­fructose family. All EIIs are composed of at least three functional domains: two

cytoplasmic domains, IIA and IIB, and the transmembrane channel IIC. In different EIIs, these domains may be linked in different ways. For example, in the cellobiose-specific EII from Escherichia coli, IIA, IIB and IIC exist as separate proteins [5], whereas the mannitol-specific EII from Bacillus stearothermophilus is composed of a linked IIB and IIC with a separate IIA [6]. In the mannitol-specific EII from E. coli, the three domains are present on a single polypeptide chain [7]. The phosphoryl group, donated to EII, is accepted on IIA and transferred to IIB, which in its phosphorylated state triggers rapid transport of the target carbohydrate by IIC and subsequently phosphorylates the transported carbohydrate (Figure 1). To understand the molecular events that take place during the different phosphotransfer reactions of the PTS, and to obtain insight into the mechanisms and regulation of carbohydrate transport, knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of the components of the PTS is essential. A number of HPr structures from a variety of bacterial sources have been determined both by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy [8]; the N-terminal domain of EI has also been solved by both methods [9,10]. No structural information on a complete EII or a IIC domain has been obtained yet. Nevertheless, the modular structure of EIIs has made it possible to subclone and express linked cytoplasmic domains as separate soluble proteins. Structural characterisation of the separate domains has been a successful first step towards the full characterisation of the various EIIs. For example, from the glucose­sucrose family, the structure of the glucose-specific enzyme IIB from E. coli (IIBglc) has been determined by NMR [11], and the structures of E. coli IIAglc and Bacillus subtilis IIAglc have been solved by both NMR [12,13] and X-ray crystallography [14,15]. A first structural insight of the regulatory interactions in which the PTS is involved was provided by the Xray structure of E. coli IIAglc in complex with glycerol kinase [16]. Structural characterisation of components of the

lactose­cellobiose family is also in progress. The solution [17] and crystal [18] structures of the E. coli cellobiose-specific enzyme IIB (IIBcel) have been elucidated and very recently the structure of the lactose-specific IIA (IIAlac) from Lactococcus lactis was published [19]. In addition, the structure of the E. coli IIA domain of the mannose-specific EII [20], a member of the mannose­sorbose family, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Structural information on the mannitol­fructose family is limited to the secondary structure assignment of the IIA domain of the mannitol-specific EII (IIAmtl) from E. coli [21]. Here we present the crystal structure of IIAmtl, which was subcloned and expressed as a fully active protein of 148 amino acids (molecular weight 16.3 kDa; [22]). Like other IIA proteins, IIAmtl is phosphorylated on the N atom of a histidine residue (His65 in the subcloned protein) [8,23].

Results and discussion
Structure determination

Difficulties were encountered at every step in the structure determination of IIAmtl. The crystals tended to grow as thin plates with typical dimensions of 0.6 × 0.15 × 0.03 mm3. In addition to their unfavourable thickness, they showed a strong tendency to intergrow, which severely limited their use in diffraction experiments. Nevertheless, our best crystals diffract to about 2.8 Å on our in-house equipment, and a high resolution data set could be obtained using synchrotron radiation. Because an extensive search for heavy-atom derivatives was unsuccessful, we attempted to replace the two methionine residues in IIAmtl with seleno-methionine for multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing [24]. A check of the incorporation of selenomethionine by electron spray mass spectroscopy revealed that only one methionine was fully substituted and that the N-terminal methionine was completely absent. One selenium atom per 147 amino acids corresponds to a theoretical maximum anomalous signal of about 2.5 % and a maximum dispersive signal of about

and BII. In each dimer, about 920 Å2 (12.5%) of the monomer surface area is buried. Although the global structures of the four molecules are identical, two different conformations of IIAmtl are observed. Molecules AI and BI are very similar with a root mean square (rms) difference in C positions of 0.41 Å, as are molecules AII and BII with an rms difference in C positions of 0.34 Å (Figure 3). The only large difference between molecules AI and BI, which is not found between molecules AII and BII, is the conformation of the loop comprising residues 47­54 (see Figure 3). This difference is caused by the presence of a hydrogen bond between the O atom of Thr53 in molecule AI and the N atom of His65 in AII. No similar interaction exists between molecules BI and BII. Between the molecules that constitute dimers, the differences are more pronounced (rms differences in C positions of 0.70 Å for dimer A, and 0.76 Å for dimer B). The largest differences occur at residues 34­42, 47­54, 66­78, 90­97 and 104­110. These residues, which are all located on the outside of the protein, are involved in interactions with molecules related by both crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. The presence of the two dimers in the asymmetric unit raises the question, whether dimer formation of the IIAmtl domains is of functional importance in mannitol transport. Extensive evidence exists that the intact EIImtl forms dimers [26,27], for which the membrane-embedded IIC domains are responsible. In contrast, subcloned IIAB domains remain monomeric at high concentrations [26]. It seems therefore likely that the IIAmtl dimers observed in the crystal are an artefact of crystal packing.
Protein structure

formed by two pairs of parallel  strands oriented antiparallel to each other and flanked by a short fifth strand of four residues (Figure 4). The order of the  strands is 14532. Two  helices pack on one side of the sheet and the other three are located on the other side. All secondary structure elements described in the secondary structure assignment by NMR spectroscopy [21] are present in the crystal structure, which in addition reveals three extra short  strands composed of residues 12­13, 56­58, and 61­62. The fold of IIAmtl is entirely different from the structures of IIA domains of other EII families. In addition, a search for structural homology using the program DALI [28] did not reveal proteins structurally similar to IIAmtl. Nevertheless, preliminary results in the structure determination of the regulatory protein IIAnitrogen (D Bordo, personal communication) suggest a more widespread occurrence of this folding motif.
The active site

The active site of IIAmtl is formed by a shallow crevice on the surface of the molecule. The phosphorylation site His65 is located at the end of the third  strand and forms the centre of this crevice. It is surrounded by a hydrophobic patch, consisting of Leu52, Pro54, Leu57, Val63, Ile112 and Ile115. The sidechain of His65 is kept in position by a hydrogen bond between its N atom and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Val63. In this way, the N atom of the histidine, which is phosphorylated by HPr [23], is ideally positioned to accept a phosphoryl group. On one side His65 is flanked by a second histidine residue, His111, and on the opposite side by an arginine residue, Arg49. Both residues are strictly conserved among IIAmtl proteins. In the four independent molecules, Arg49 and His111 occupy two distinct conformations (Figure 5). In molecules AI and BI the sidechain of

The structure of IIAmtl is composed of a central five stranded  sheet, flanked by five  helices. The  sheet is

Arg49 points away from the phosphorylation site and forms a hydrogen bond between its N atom and the mainchain carbonyl oxygen atom of Glu66. The imidazole ring of His111 is oriented parallel to the sidechain of the catalytic His65. In molecules AII and BII, the sidechain of Arg49 is located close to the phosphorylation site, making a hydrogen bond between its N atom and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr53. In contrast, the sidechain of His111 points away from the catalytic histidine and does not interact with other residues. The occurrence of a second histidine in the active site with two different conformations has already been observed in NMR experiments [23]. It is intriguing that Arg49 adopts two different conformations as well, which seem to be correlated with the conformation of the histidine. IIAmtl is involved in two phosphoryl transfer reactions, the first one to accept a phosphoryl group from

HPr, the second one to donate a phosphoryl group to IIBmtl. The observed two conformational states of the active site of IIAmtl may be of functional significance for the interaction with either HPr or IIBmtl.
Comparison with other IIA proteins

With the three-dimensional structure of IIAmtl, detailed structural information is now available for the IIA components of all four EII families (Figure 6). The fold of the IIAglc proteins, which belong to the glucose­sucrose EII family, consists of a  sheet sandwich, with each sheet composed of six antiparallel strands [14,15]. It contains almost no -helical structure. In contrast, the lactosespecific IIAlac, which is a member of the lactose­cellobiose family, is almost entirely -helical. Each IIAlac monomer forms a triple -helical bundle, three of which

make up a nine -helical bundle in the functional trimer [19]. The representatives from the mannose­sorbose family and the mannitol­fructose family, IIAman and IIAmtl, are both / proteins. In the mannose-specific enzyme II, the IIA and IIB activities are located on a soluble IIABman protein. Two IIABman molecules form a functional dimer through their respective IIAman domains. The IIAman monomer contains a four-stranded parallel  sheet, flanked by  helices on either side of the sheet. A fifth antiparallel strand is donated by the other monomer [20]. Interestingly, the fold of IIAman is structurally more similar to the IIB enzyme of the cellobiose-specific PTS than to a IIA enzyme from any of the other families. IIAmtl (this paper) contains a central five-stranded  sheet composed of two pairs of parallel  strands running antiparallel to each other, and a fifth antiparallel strand. The sheet is flanked by  helices on both sides.
Interactions of IIAmtl with the phosphocarrier protein HPr

Figure 7

In spite of the differences in their tertiary and quaternary structures, IIA enzymes usually interact with the same HPr. This implies that structurally unrelated IIA enzymes have to provide similar HPr-binding sites, complementary to the interaction surface of HPr. To investigate the interaction of IIAmtl with HPr, we have calculated two lowenergy transition state complexes by molecular modelling, using the solution structure of the phosphorylated form of E. coli HPr [29] and the two conformations of IIAmtl, represented by molecules AI and AII. The models were created by linking the N atom of His65 of IIAmtl with the phosphorus atom of phospho-HPr, in such a way that the phosphorylation sites on the respective proteins (His65 of IIAmtl and His15 of HPr) occupied the apical positions of the pentacoordinated transition state of the phosphorus atom. Rotation around the apical axis of the transitionstate intermediate and subsequent minimisation of the energy, led to a favourable low energy model of each transition-state complex. In the two HPr­IIAmtl complexes thus generated, the overall mode of interaction is very similar. The two complexes superimpose on each other with an rms difference in C coordinates of 0.69 Å, which is mainly due to the difference in the IIAmtl starting models. The total surface area buried upon complex formation is in both complexes about 1600 Å2, which is in the same range as observed in the modelled HPr­IIAlac complex (1700 Å2) [19] but somewhat higher than found in the modelled HPr­IIAglc complex (1100 Å2) [30]. The IIAmtl-binding site of HPr involves the loop comprising residues 13­21, the helix composed of residues 16­27 and the helix containing residues 48­56 (Figure 7). These regions interact with residues in and flanking the IIAmtl active site, which are mainly located in the  strand composed of residues 51­60 and the helix of residues 110­120.

(b) Top view of the modelled complex of HPr and molecule AII of IIAmtl, coloured as for (a).

The IIAmtl-binding site on HPr has experimentally been determined by titration of 15N-labelled HPr with a solution of unlabelled IIAmtl, and by monitoring the effects on the amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts of HPr [31]. In the same way, information has been obtained for the HPr-binding site on IIAmtl (GJA Kroon et al., personal communication). In general, our models are in good agreement with the experimental data. Residues 13­21 and 48­56 of HPr and residues 51­60, 63­66 and 110­120 of IIAmtl show indeed the largest changes in the NMR chemical shifts. In addition, the chemical shifts of residues 122­131 are affected upon binding of HPr. These residues do not belong to the binding interface in our models, but a small reorientation of the  helix composed of residues 110­120 might induce conformational changes in this part

of the structure. It will be exciting to see whether this will be observed in an experimentally determined structure of the complex. Although the overall mode of binding is similar in the two models, they differ in the details of the interactions of the phosphoryl group (Figure 8). The question arises of which of the two models is the most likely representation of the HPr­IIAmtl transition-state complex. In the model based on molecule AI, both the backbone amide group and the O atom of Thr16 of HPr make a hydrogen bond with one of the oxygen atoms of the phosphoryl group, while no interaction is observed with the strictly conserved residues His111 and Arg49 of IIAmtl (Figure 8a). In contrast, in the model based on molecule AII, the guanidinium group of Arg49 makes hydrogen bonds with two of the oxygen atoms of the phosphoryl group. A third hydrogen bond is made by one of these oxygen atoms and the amide group

of Arg17 of HPr (Figure 8b). The interactions of the phosphoryl group in the latter model seem better suited to stabilise the negatively charged transition state for the phosphoryl transfer from HPr to IIAmtl. In all modelled HPr­IIA complexes, both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are important in the stabilisation of the complexes [19,20,30]. The most important electrostatic interaction in the HPr­IIAglc complex involves the invariant residue Arg17 of HPr and the carboxylate groups of the conserved residues Asp31 and Asp87 of IIAglc [30]. A similar interaction of Arg17 with the carboxylate group of Glu100 of IIAman has been suggested to stabilise the HPr­IIAman complex [20]. For the interaction of HPr with IIAlac, it was concluded that such an electrostatic interaction is most likely missing [19]. In the HPr­IIAmtl complex, this electrostatic interaction also seems to be absent, as Arg17 forms hydrogen bonds with the mainchain carbonyl groups of Tyr56 and Val63 of IIAmtl in our

Research Article Phosphotransferase IIAmannitol van Montfort et al.

modelled complex. We can not exclude the possibility that a conformational change makes Glu110 available for the interaction with Arg17 of HPr. Glu110 is the only strictly conserved carboxylate group in the vicinity of the active site. Differences in the stabilisation of HPr residue Arg17 by IIA proteins of the various EII families might be part of a subtle mechanism to control the hierarchy of carbohydrate utilisation by the bacterium.
Phosphotransfer reactions

Biological implications
Bacteria catalyse the cellular uptake of many carbohydrates via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS is also crucial in the regulation of a number of metabolic processes and is involved in chemotaxis towards PTS substrates. The PTS is composed of three catalytic entities: two general proteins, enzyme I (E I) and the histidine-containing protein (HPr), and the carbohydrate-specific complex (E II). Carbohydrate transport is catalysed by the E II complex. EIIs contain at least three functional domains: two cytoplasmic domains, IIA and IIB, and a membrane-embedded IIC domain. IIA proteins transfer a phosphoryl group from HPr to IIB, which subsequently phosphorylates the transported carbohydrate. To obtain insight into the mechanism of carbohydrate transport and the interactions in which the different components of the PTS are involved, knowledge of their threedimensional structures is essential. We present here the structure of the IIA domain of the mannitol-specific EII (IIAmtl), with which detailed structural information is now available for IIA domains of the four main EII families. Intriguingly, the structurally characterised IIA domains of the different EII families have completely different tertiary and quaternary structures, whereas their primary function, the phosphoryl transfer from HPr to a IIB enzyme, is the same. The difference in folds provides a structural framework for the hierarchy in PTS-mediated carbohydrate uptake, and it might be part of a mechanism to prevent unwanted crosstalk between different PTS. In addition, the diversification of folds might enable different IIA domains to meet the requirements for the interaction with the structurally diverse IIB enzymes. Regardless of the observed structural differences, IIA enzymes are always phosphorylated on a histidine residue -- His65 in the case of IIAmtl. Comparison of our transition-state model of the HPr­IIAmtl complex with complexes of HPr with other IIA enzymes suggests that the overall mode of interaction is similar. The way in which IIA domains stabilise the different phosphoryl intermediates, however, appears to be different. In contrast to the other IIA enzymes, IIAmtl possesses an arginine residue, Arg49, which may play a catalytic role in the phosphoryl transfer reactions of IIAmtl. Moreover, this arginine residue, and a second active site histidine (His111), are present in two conformations in the four independent molecules in the crystal. The two conformations of these conserved residues might indicate a switch mechanism for phosphoryl transfer from HPr to a IIB enzyme, unique for the carbohydrate-specific IIA enzymes of the mannitol­fructose family. The IIAmtl structure provides a good starting point for the full

A phosphoryl transfer between two PTS proteins involves an in-line attack of the phosphorus atom by the acceptor protein. A trigonal bipyramidal transition state is formed with a pentavalent coordination of the phosphorus atom. Productive break down of the transition state results in an inversion of the configuration at the phosphorus atom [30,32]. In the PTS, arginine residues are often involved in the stabilisation of the transition state and/or the stabilisation of the phospho-protein intermediate [11,30]. The occurrence of two conformations of the active-site residue Arg49 of IIAmtl, which seem to be coupled to the two conformations of His111, raises the question whether these two conformations represent the different states of the active site required for the phosphoryl transfer from HPr to IIAmtl on the one hand and from IIAmtl to IIBmtl on the other. Unfortunately, no biochemical evidence for the roles of Arg49 and His111 in the different phosphoryl transfer steps is available. Our modelling experiments suggest, however, that the sidechain of Arg49 in molecule AII is ideally positioned to stabilise the transition state in the phosphoryl transfer from HPr to IIAmtl. In addition, this conformation would allow Arg49 to stabilise a phospho-IIAmtl intermediate. In the next phosphoryl transfer reaction from IIAmtl to IIBmtl, the phospho-IIAmtl intermediate needs to be destabilised. Such a situation can be obtained with a conformation of Arg49 as observed in molecule AI, in which Arg49 is turned away and can not form hydrogen bonds with the phosphoryl group. The role of His111 is less clear. By analogy with IIAglc, in which the second active-site histidine residue is essential for the phosphoryl transfer from IIAglc to IIBglc [15,33], it has been suggested that in IIAmtl His111 might also be needed for the phosphoryl transfer to IIBmtl [34]. In molecule AII, the conformation which seems best suited for the interaction with HPr, His111 points away from the phosphorylation site. A direct role in phosphoryl transfer from HPr therefore seems unlikely. In molecule AI, however, the imidazole ring of His111 is oriented almost parallel to the sidechain of His65. It will be much closer to the phosphoryl group in the IIAmtl­IIBmtl transition state complex, and thus might be the preferred conformation for transfer of the phosphoryl group to IIBmtl. Nevertheless, further insight into the different roles of the activesite residues awaits the structure determination of IIBmtl and the results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments, which are currently being carried out in our laboratories.

Materials and methods
Expression, purification and incorporation of selenomethionine in IIAmtl
Overexpression and purification of native IIAmtl was done as described previously [22]. For production and overexpression of [SeMet]IIAmtl, the methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain LE392 (PROMEGA, Madison, USA) was used. Transformants of this strain with the plasmid PJL503 were grown on M9 medium supplied with the 19 other amino acids and 50 mg/ml L-selenomethionine. Isolation and purification of [SeMet]IIAmtl were carried out using a procedure similar to that used for IIAmtl. Incorporation of one selenium atom per IIAmtl molecule was confirmed by electron spray mass spectroscopy, which in addition revealed the absence of the N-terminal methionine residue from the [SeMet]IIAmtl protein.

5 mM Na2EDTA, 2 mM DTT and 1 mM NaN3. Data sets were collected at three wavelengths at or near the K absorption edge of selenium. Wavelengths were selected on the basis of an X-ray fluorescence spectrum collected directly from the crystal: 1 (0.9797 Å) optimised for f, 2 (0.9796 Å) at maximal f and a remote wavelength 3 (0.8728 Å) to be able to obtain the dispersive differences. No special care was taken in the alignment of the crystal and a normal beam geometry was used during data collection. After the structure was solved, a 1.8 Å resolution native data set was collected at 120K on the MAR Research image plate system at the X11 beamline of the EMBL outstation at DESY, Hamburg. All data sets were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK [38]. Conversion to mtzformat and scaling of the 2 and 3 data sets to the 1 data was carried out using programs of the Groningen BIOMOL software package. Statistics of the data collection are shown in Table 1.

MAD analysis
Patterson maps calculated with the anomalous differences ||F2(+)|­|F2(­)|| and with the dispersive differences ||F3|­|F1|| both showed a single peak of more than 20 sigma at equivalent positions in the Harker section. From this peak, the corresponding cross peaks and a self-Patterson map, the coordinates of the four selenium sites in the asymmetric unit could be derived. The selenium parameters were refined with MLPHARE [39] with 1 chosen as the native data set. The real occupancies of the selenium sites were fixed at zero in the `native' data set. The final Figure of merit was 0.45 for data to 2.65 Å. Inspection of electron-density maps calculated with data to 3.0 Å after solvent flattening and histogram matching, using DM [40], showed the position of the four independent molecules in the asymmetric unit as well as a small part of an  helix. NCS operators could be established relating molecule AI to BI and AII to BII, but it was not possible to relate molecule AI to AII and molecule BI to BII. The electron-density maps were therefore further improved by averaging molecules AI and BI, and AII and BII. The resulting electron-density maps revealed more secondary structure elements. This allowed us to establish the NCS operators that relate molecule AI to molecule AII and BII. An interpretable electron-density map was obtained after fourfold averaging, solvent flattening and histogram matching at 2.65 Å, using DM. To check the quality of the NCS operators, correlation coefficients were calculated with the program IMP of the RAVE package [41]. All masks were generated with the program NCSMASK [39] and edited

Crystallisation and data collection
Crystals of native IIAmtl could be obtained by vapour diffusion, using a slightly modified protocol compared to the one described previously [35]. The protein solution used in the crystallisation experiments contained 4.5 mg/ml IIAmtl, 10 mM 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol(Tris)/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA and 1 mM NaN3. The drops, composed of a 1:1 mixture of protein solution and reservoir solution, were equilibrated against a reservoir containing 36­38% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.1 mM N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropane sulfonic acid(Taps)/NaOH, pH 8.7, 5 mM Na2EDTA and 1 mM NaN3 at a temperature of 5°C. Crystals of [SeMet]IIAmtl could be grown under similar conditions as the native protein, with 5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) added to the protein solution to prevent oxidation of the selenomethionine. The crystals of native IIAmtl and [SeMet]IIAmtl are of similar quality. They belong to the space group P21, with cell dimensions a = 53.6 Å, b = 60.0 Å, c = 73.9 Å and  = 99.8°. The asymmetric unit contains four IIAmtl molecules. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected at beamline BM14 (ESRF, Grenoble) using the image intensified CCD detector developed at the ESRF [36,37]. All MAD data were collected from a single [SeMet]IIAmtl crystal, which was frozen at 120K. Before freezing the crystal was soaked for 2­3 minutes in a mother liquor containing 35% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.1 M Taps/NaOH, pH 8.7, 75 mM NaCl, Table 1 Data collection and MAD analysis.

with MAMA [41]. The initial model was fitted to the density using the program O [42].

Refinement and quality of the model
The model was subjected to simulated annealing refinement with XPLOR [43]. This was followed by several rounds of maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC [44], combined with manual rebuilding steps. Water molecules were added using ARP [45]. The final model consists of residues 4­148 for molecule AI, residues 5­145 for molecule BI, residues 3­148 for molecule AII, residues 4­147 for molecule BII and 570 water molecules. Residue 148 of molecule AII was built as an alanine, because its sidechain was not visible in the electron density. The model has been refined using data between 5.0 and 1.8 Å to an Rcryst of 19.0% (Rcryst for all data between 5.0­1.8 Å is 18.5%), Rfree of 24.2%, with 92.3% of the residues in the most favoured regions, 7.3% in the additional allowed regions and 0.4% in the generously allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot according to PROCHECK [46]. The rms deviations from ideality in bond lengths and angles are 0.007 Å and 1.4 Å, respectively.

Modelling of the HPr­IIAmtl complex
The HPr­IIAmtl complexes were generated using QUANTA/CHARMm [47]. The first coordinate set of the solution structure of the phosphorylated form of E. coli HPr (PDB entry code 1PFH; [29]) was chosen as a starting model for phospho-HPr, as this set is closest to the ensemble average of the 20 HPr conformations. Two HPr­IIAmtl complexes were generated with different IIAmtl starting models (molecule AI and molecule AII), representing the two conformations observed in the crystal. A procedure similar to the one used in the modelling experiments with HPr and the other IIA structures was used [19,20,30]. IIAmtl and HPr were linked with the N atom of His65 of IIAmtl positioned at a distance of 2.0 Å from the phosphorus atom, in such a way that a trigonal bipyramidal transition state was formed of the phosphorus atom, in which the N atom of His15 of HPr, the phosphorus atom and the N atom of His65 of IIAmtl were connected in a straight line. A conformational search was carried out by rotating the complex around the N­P­N axis in steps of 5°. At each step, the potential energy was minimised by 100 steps of steepest descent, while the positions of the N, P and N atoms were constrained to retain the geometry of the transition state. Atomic charges for the complex were derived from QUANTA templates (only polar hydrogen atoms were included). A distance-dependent dielectric constant of  = 4r/Å was used to compensate for the absence of water. The cut-off radius for the nonbonded interactions was 14 Å and a switching function between 11 and 14 Å was applied. The lowest energy conformation was further minimised using 100 steps of conjugate gradient minimisation. Mapping of the experimentally determined IIAmtl-binding site on HPr and the HPrbinding site on IIAmtl on the modelled complexes was used to select the best model, which in both HPr­IIAmtl complexes corresponded to the lowest energy structure. The total buried surface in the HPr­IIAmtl complexes was calculated with the program ASC 2.1 [48]. Rms differences in C positions of the starting models compared with the modelled complexes are 0.31 Å for HPr and 0.38 Å for IIA molecule AI in the HPr­IIA(AI) complex and 0.36 Å for HPr and 0.33 Å for IIA molecule AII in the HPr­IIA(AII) complex. These values indicate that the overall protein structures have not been distorted by the modelling procedure.
