Abstract: The nature of transient protein complexes can range from a highly dynamic ensemble of orientations to a single well-defined state. This represents variation in the equilibrium between the encounter and final, functional state. The transient complex between plastocyanin (Pc) and cytochrome f (cytf) of the cyanobacterium Prochlorothrix hollandica was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Intermolecular pseudocontact shifts and chemical shift perturbations were used as restraints in docking calculations to determine the structure of the wild-type Pc-cytf complex. The orientation of Pc is similar to orientations found in Pc-cytf complexes from other sources. Electrostatics seems to play a modest role in complex formation. A large variability in the ensemble of lowest energy structures indicates a dynamic nature of the complex. Two unusual hydrophobic patch residues in Pc have been mutated to the residues found in other plastocyanins (Y12G/P14L). The binding constants are similar for the complexes of cytf with wild-type Pc and mutant Pc, but the chemical shift perturbations are smaller for the complex with mutant Pc. Docking calculations for the Y12G/P14L Pc-cytf complex did not produce a converged ensemble of structures. Simulations of the dynamics were performed using the observed averaged NMR parameters as input. The results indicate a surprisingly large amplitude of mobility of Y12G/P14L Pc within the complex. It is concluded that the double mutation shifts the complex further from the well-defined toward the encounter state.

Introduction

Recent studies have shown the existence of dynamic encounter complexes in transient protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.1-3 The encounter state (or encounter complex) is thought to precede the well-defined (or single-orientation) complex as illustrated in a two-step model for protein complex formation (Figure 1). In earlier studies, transient protein complexes were found to range from entirely dynamic to mostly well-defined.4-12 The complex of plastocyanin (Pc) and cytochrome f (cytf) is an interesting example in this respect, because

comparative studies have shown that the degree of dynamics within the complex varies strongly between species. The soluble plastocyanin transfers electrons in oxygenic photosynthesis between the membrane-bound cytochrome b6f and photosystem I complexes.13,14 Pc is a small (11 kDa) blue copper protein, which contains a type I copper site for electron transfer.15,16 Cytf is a c-type heme containing cytochrome, of which the truncated N-terminal soluble part (28 kDa) is used for in vitro experiments (refs 17-19 and references therein).

Cd-Substitution of Pc. Cd-substitution of plastocyanin was essentially done as described33 with the following modifications. Of a 200 mM KCN, 500 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0 solution, 0.5 mL was added to 0.5 mL of 1 mM oxidized Pc. The sample was then loaded on a G25 Sephadex column pre-equilibrated with 1 mM CdCl2, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0. The buffer was exchanged to water and then to 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. NMR Samples. All protein samples contained 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 6% D2O. Protein concentrations were determined by optical spectroscopy using 602 of 4.9 mM-1 cm-1 for oxidized Cuplastocyanin (PCu), 554 of 24.9 mM-1 cm-1 for reduced cytf, and 278 of 7.6 mM-1 cm-1 for Cd-plastocyanin (PCd) ( 278 based on atomic absorption measurements). The pH was adjusted with microliter aliquots of 0.1 or 0.5 M HCl. Samples for assignment contained 1.0 mM 15Nlabeled PCd. For titrations, both Cu(II) and Cd-substituted 15N-labeled Pc were concentrated to 0.2 mM. Wild-type PCd could not be used for titrations because of unfolding in the presence of high amounts of cytf. This was not the case for the mutant PCd, which is more stable in both the Cu- and Cd-substituted form. The copper proteins were reduced by addition of 2.0 mM ascorbate and flushed with argon to prevent reoxidation. Aliquots of a 1.33 mM cytf stock solution were added to the Pc containing samples. Samples for determination of PCS contained 85 µM 15N-labeled wild type or mutant PCd and 50 or 100 µM oxidized cytf, respectively. Cytf was subsequently reduced in the sample by addition of 20 equiv of sodium ascorbate. The pH was measured before and after each experiment. NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker DMX600 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance TCIZGRAD ATM Cryoprobe (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Chemicalshift perturbation and pseudocontact shift(s) (PCS) studies were performed by acquiring 15N,1H HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra). Spectral widths of 40 ppm (15N) and 13.5 ppm (1H) were used, and 1024 and 256 complex points were acquired in the direct and indirect dimension, respectively. Cd-substituted wild-type and mutant Pc resonances were assigned using 3D NOESY-HSQC and 3D TOCSY-HSQC experiments. Data were processed with AZARA 2.734 and analyzed in ANSIG for Windows.35 Binding Curves and Chemical Shift Mapping. Averaged chemical shift perturbations (avg) were derived from the following equation:

Pc-cytf complexes determined so far have been determined by NMR spectroscopy.4,8,20,21 The first structure of the plant complex revealed an electron-transfer pathway between the hydrophobic patch surrounding the copper site of Pc and heme ligand Tyr1 in cytf.8 Kinetic studies in vitro13,22-27 have shown that electrostatics play an important role in complex formation. In vivo studies suggest, however, that charged residues are not relevant for fast electron-transfer reactions.28,29 Nonetheless, the structure of the plant complex showed that the acidic "eastern" patch on Pc interacts with a set of basic residues in the small domain of cytf. The results suggested that this complex is mostly in a well-defined state. The structure of the complex from cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 (former A. Variabilis) is similar to that from plants, yet the interaction charges between Pc and cytf are interchanged.21 The complex of Phormidium laminosum Pc and cytf demonstrated that the charge interactions are not absolutely necessary for a functional complex. In this case, the proteins mostly interact through hydrophobic contacts. The structure showed poorer convergence to a well-defined state, suggesting more dynamics within the complex.4 Plastocyanin from cyanobacterium Prochlorothrix hollandica contains two unusual residues located in the hydrophobic patch, which have been mutated to the residues normally found in these positions (Tyr12Gly/Pro14Leu). The mutant Pc has been shown to react differently with photosystem I30 and was suggested to be more dynamic in complex with cytf from Ph. laminosum.31 Here, we report the structure of the physiological complex between P. hollandica Pc and cytf and show that the existing equilibrium between encounter and well-defined state in the complex is shifted toward the encounter state by the mutation of two unusual hydrophobic patch residues (Y12G/P14L). It is concluded that this complex is on the border between dynamic and well-defined states.
Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and Purification. Mutant and wild-type 15Nlabeled P. hollandica plastocyanin were expressed and purified as described before.31 Cytf was expressed and purified essentially as described,32 in which the coding sequence of the P. hollandica cytf soluble domain (GenBank AF486288) was ligated in-frame to the Ph. laminosum Pc leader coding sequence and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purification procedure followed the protocol for the Ph. laminosum protein.32 Yields of pure cytf were typically 3 mg protein per liter of culture.

Structure Determination. The coordinates for P. hollandica Pc were taken from the solution structure (PDB entry 1B3I37). Mutations Y12G and P14L were introduced in silico, using DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer version 3.7.38 A model of P. hollandica cytf based on Ph. laminosum cytf (PDB entry 1CI339) was created with MODELLER 6v2.40 Docking of Pc onto cytf was done using restrained rigid body molecular dynamics in XPLOR-NIH 2.9.9.41 The coordinates of cytf were fixed, while Pc was placed at a random position and allowed to move under the forces of restraints and a van der Waals repel function. Only the interactions between the backbone and C atoms of Pc and all atoms of cytf were considered at this stage. The restraints were divided into three classes. Chemical shift perturbations in the presence of reduced cytf were attributed to the proximity of the protein. The average relative solventaccessible surface area of each Pc residue was calculated with NACCESS 2.1.1.42 Residues with a surface accessible surface area of more than 50% and bind g 0.1 (15N) or 0.02 (1H) were included in the class for interface restraints. Pseudocontact and angle restraints based on PCS were defined as described.8 Residues that do not experience a PCS were included in a minimal distance restraint class. A summary of the restraints is given in Table 1. The product of the number of restraints and the scale used in the calculations indicates the weight of each group. The rigid-body molecular dynamics was essentially done as described before.4,8,20,21 A run comprised 3000 cycles, each of 1000 steps. Structures below an energy threshold were saved, yielding 200 structures per run. To obtain multiple independent dockings during a run Pc was randomly displaced after having reached an energy minimum, with energies changing less than 2-fold during 10 cycles. Approximately 130 displacements occurred per run. The resulting structures were ranked according to total restraint energy, and the lowest energy structures were subjected to energy minimization of the side chains in the interface. This ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 2P80). Figures 3, 5, and 8 were made in PyMOL v0.98.43 The buried interface area was calculated using NACCESS. Pseudocontact Simulations. The PCS simulations were done using XPLOR-NIH. The lowest energy structure of wild-type Pc-cytf was used as the initial orientation of the Y12G/P14L Pc-cytf complex. The relative diffusional movement in the mutant complex of Pc-cytf was decomposed into two types of rotations. Pc was rotated around its center of mass (wobble) and around the origin of the magnetic susceptibility tensor frame; the heme iron in cytf (rotation). For this purpose three pseudoatoms, representing the magnetic susceptibility tensor were placed at 2 Å from the heme metal center in cytf. They were used as a reference frame with the zz component of the tensor placed along the Fe-Tyr1N vector. Each rotation was again decomposed in three directions (X, Y, and Z), resulting in sets of six variables for the complete movement. For a given set (for example, 40°, 80°, 35°/60°, 60°, 60°)

Results and Discussion

Complex of P. hollandica PCu and cytf: Wild-Type versus Y12G/P14L Pc. To compare the effects of binding, chemical shift perturbations were analyzed for wild-type and Y12G/P14L P. hollandica Pc upon titration with cytf. The presence of reduced cytf gives rise to distinct changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-PCu(I). A single averaged resonance was observed for each amide indicating that exchange between free and bound Pc is fast on the NMR-time scale. The observed chemical shift changes (bind) of the most affected residues were plotted against the molar ratio of cytf: 15N-PCu (Figure 2) and fitted to a 1:1 binding model.23 This yields a Ka of 25 ((2) × 103 M-1 for wild-type PCu and 20 ((1) × 103 M-1 for Y12G/P14L PCu. Although the binding constants are very similar, there is a significant difference in the size of the chemical shift perturbations. This becomes apparent when the average chemical shift perturbations (avg) per residue are considered (Figure 3). From the figure, it is clear that the hydrophobic patch surrounding the copper site is the main site involved in complex formation, as seen in Pc-cytf complexes from other organisms.4,8,20,21,45 The residues that are affected in the wild-type complex are generally also affected in the mutant complex, but the size of the chemical shift changes is clearly smaller, by about 40%. This is comparable to the results obtained for the complex of P. hollandica Pc and cytf from Ph. laminosum,31 and suggests increased dynamics in the complex of Y12G/P14L Pc and cytf. A comparison of the size of the PCS found for the complex with wild type and mutant Pc (see later, Figure 7A) supports this notion.

The affinity between Pc and cytf decreases with increasing ionic strength (Figure 4). A reduction of bind of 46% at 200 mM NaCl is observed, indicating electrostatics play a role in complex formation. The Pc Y12G/P14L complex is similarly affected by ionic strength, with bind reduced by 42%. This

demonstrates that the effect of ionic strength on complex formation is similar in the wild-type and mutant complexes. Structure of the Complex of P. hollandica Pc-cytf. The structure of P. hollandica Pc-cytf complex has been determined by rigid-body structure calculations using restraints obtained by NMR spectroscopy. Two types of NMR data were used. One is chemical shift perturbations of solvent exposed Pc residues, which give information on the proximity of these residues to cytf. The other is intermolecular pseudocontact shifts, which are observed in the presence of paramagnetic, oxidized cytf and give both distance and angular information on the proximity of Pc residues to the Fe(III).8 To be able to study the interaction of Pc with both oxidized and reduced cytf without interference from electron-transfer reactions, the Cu in Pc was substituted with Cd (PCd). A titration followed by 1H-15N HSQC spectra showed that the complex of PCd Y12G/P14L has a Ka of 26 ((3) × 103 M-1, similar to that of the complex with PCu Y12G/P14L. The observed avg in the mutant PCd complex are identical for forty percent of the perturbed residues, while for residues in the vicinity of the metal site and the "eastern patch" avg values differ between Pc containing Cu(I) and Cd(II). Similar differences have been observed before for Ph. laminosum Cdsubstituted Pc in complex with cytf46 and are most likely caused by the charge difference between the metals. Comparison of avg or Ka between the wild type PCu and PCd complexes was not possible because of experimental limitations (see Materials and Methods). The rigid body calculations with the restraints summarized in Table 1 converge to an ensemble of complexes, which is depicted by an overlay of the twenty lowest energy structures in Figure 5A. The ensemble is characterized by a Cu-Fe

For every residue the 15N value is shown (major tick), followed by the 1H value (minor tick). The bottom panel shows the back-calculated angles (0) between the nucleus, the heme iron, and the Tyr1 N atom. Positive PCS are expected to give an angle <54.7° (solid line).

distance of 13.4 ( 1.4 Å. The average positional rmsd from the mean structure of the Pc backbone atoms in the 20 lowest energy structures is 4.6 ( 2.7 Å. This variability is mainly due to a relative translational displacement of the Pc on the cytf surface. Violation analysis of both angles and PCS (Figure 6) shows that there is a large degree of variation between the structures. In structure calculations of other Pc-cytf complexes

better convergence was observed using similar input.8,20,21 Therefore, we believe the limited convergence is an indication of real dynamics rather than a lack of sufficient restraints. The observed restraints in this case represent an average that can be approximated by an ensemble of structures. For residues in the loop regions 35-41 and 46-51 of Pc, negative PCS are predicted in part of the structures. This is related to the angle between the nucleus-iron vector and the Fe-Tyr1 N bond, which exceeds 54.7°, resulting in a sign change of the PCS.47 Both the rmsd and violations for the ensemble indicate that the P. hollandica Pc-cytf complex is much more dynamic than the plant and Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 complexes8,21 and more closely resembles the highly dynamic P. laminosum complex.4 The orientation of wild-type Pc in the lowest energy P. hollandica Pc-cytf complex (Figure 5B) is reminiscent of the orientation found for Nostoc sp. PCC 7119.21 The binding interface comprises 15 Pc residues, all located in the hydrophobic patch, including Tyr12 and Pro14. The buried interface area for Pc is calculated to be 860 Å2. Similarly, 15 cytf residues and the propionate side chains of the heme contribute to a buried interface area of 725 Å2. Although the chemical shift changes in the complex are salt dependent (see earlier) the only charged residues in the interface are Asp63 in cytf, which interacts with Thr58 in Pc and Arg86 in Pc, which could interact with Tyr162 in cytf. Some polar residues are present in the interface, mainly on the cytf side, but clear electrostatic contributions as seen in the plant and Nostoc Pc-cytf complexes are not found. The lack of interaction between the eastern patch on Pc and the small domain of cytf as found in the plant and Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 complex could account for the more dynamic nature of the P. hollandica complex. Such interactions are lacking in the Ph. laminosum Pc-cytf complex, which is also very dynamic. In the lowest energy structure the coupling pathway for electron transfer comprises the heme ligand Tyr1 and the solvent-exposed copper ligand His85. This pathway has also been found in plant Pc-cytf complexes.8,20 It has to be

noted that because of the variation in the ensemble a detailed analysis of electron-transfer pathways is not possible. Dynamics in P. hollandica Y12G/P14L Pc-cytf Complex. When the PCS in the wild type and Y12G/P14L Pc-cytf complexes are compared a clear decrease in their size for the mutant complex can be observed (Figure 7A), except for the last 10 residues. The decrease in size of chemical shift perturbations (see earlier) and PCS in the mutant complex leads to less and weaker restraints, which in turn cause more possible orientations with similar energies. As a result, rigid-body structure calculations for the P. hollandica Y12G/P14L Pccytf complex did not lead to any converged ensemble of structures, contrary to the case of the wild-type complex. The inhomogeneous decrease in PCS and lack of convergence of the calculations can be attributed to a more dynamic nature of the Y12G/P14L Pc-cytf complex. Simulations were done to determine the degree of movement in the mutant complex sufficient to result in the observed averaged PCS (Figure 7A). The orientation of the lowest energy complex between wild-type Pc and cytf was used as a starting point. Rotation of Pc around the Fe axis in each direction was analyzed, an example for 60° is shown in Figure S1. It was

concluded that rotation in a single direction does not result in an ensemble of orientations that closely matches the observed and simulated PCS. The effect of rotation around the center of mass of Pc Y12G/P14L (wobble) of various degrees was analyzed as well (Figure S2). This movement clearly affects the overall size of the average PCS. It has to be noted though, that the chemical shift perturbation map indicates that the binding site is localized mostly at the hydrophobic patch. Thus, an ensemble of orientations that results from this movement over for example 180° is unrealistic. By trying systematicly combinations of rotation and wobbling, it was found that rotation of Pc around the Fe with amplitudes of 40°, 80°, and 35° in the x-, y-, and z-direction, respectively, combined with rotation around the center of mass of Pc Y12G/P14L (wobble) of 60° in all directions results in an ensemble of orientations with average PCS values that closely resemble those observed (Figure 7B). This solution is not unique; there are more combinations of variables that lead to similar results. For example rotation of 60°, 90°, and 45° in the x-, y- and z-direction, respectively, combined with rotation around the center of mass of Pc Y12G/ P14L (wobble) of 60° in all directions was found to result in very similar average PCS and a similar spread in Pc positions

(Figure S3). Some Pc Y12G/P14L residues have deviating PCS values in all simulations. These residues (33-37 and 57-59) are found in the interface and are also the most violated in the wild-type structure (Figure 6), which suggests that these deviations are not specific for the Y12G/P14L Pc-cytf complex. It must be noted, however, that residues 33-37 are found to be the most affected by the mutations Y12G/P14L apart from residues neighboring the mutations,31 perhaps indicating a structural difference in this part of the mutant Pc, as compared to the wild type. The 50 orientations of Pc Y12G/P14L that result from the simulation mentioned above are visualized in Figure 8. From these simulations, it is clear that a considerable range of orientations is sampled in the mutant complex. It also demonstrates that merely the observation of PCS cannot be used as evidence for a well-defined complex. The Cu-Fe distances are mostly too large for electron transfer, so only a subset of states will be suitable for electron transfer. Since the wild-type and mutant complex have similar binding constants and the electrontransfer rates to Pc are similar (k2 ) 2-3 × 108 M-1 s-1; Baranova and Bullerjahn, manuscript in preparation), it provides an example of two complexes that differ mainly in their dynamics.

It can be concluded that the mutation of the two hydrophobic patch residues Tyr12 and Pro14 to the residues found in other plastocyanins, results in a more dynamic complex of Pc and cytf. These mutations provide a way to compare the reasonably well-defined wild-type Pc-cytf complex with one that is more dynamic, presenting an opportunity to examine the movements and dynamics in the encounter state of a transient proteinprotein complex.
