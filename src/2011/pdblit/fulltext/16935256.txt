Abstract Complex I in bovine heart submitochondrial particles catalyses the NADH-supported generation of superoxide anion; adrenaline is oxidised by superoxide to adrenochrome that, on its hand, is reduced by Complex I, thus establishing a redox cycle that ampliWes the superoxide production. The routes in Complex I for superoxide formation and for adrenochrome reduction appear to be diVerent, since they have a diVerent sensitivity to Complex I inhibitors. The results are discussed in terms of current assays for superoxide detection and of pathologies linked to catecholamine oxidation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adrenaline (epinephrine) may undergo oxidation and cyclisation to adrenochrome in a multi-step process in which the main oxidant under physiological conditions is the superoxide anion [1]; for this reason the reaction has been extensively used as a tool for detection of superoxide formation in biological materials [2­6]. On the other hand, adrenochrome can be reduced to the corresponding semiquinone by NADPH in liver microsomes [7] and by NADH and mitochondrial Complex I in bovine heart submitochondrial particles [8]: the semiquinone may then react with molecular oxygen, thus producing superoxide and regenerating adrenochrome [8]. Since adrenochrome, as the oxidation product of adrenaline, has been detected in biological samples [9­11], this redox cycle is potentially dangerous to living tissues, and adrenochrome toxicity has been implicated in several pathological states [10,12,13]. Similar events may also occur

with other catecholamines, such has dopamine and noradrenaline [13,14]. The analysis of the subcellular distribution of 14C-adrenochrome in isolated perfused rat heart showed some accumulation also in the mitochondrial fraction, indicating that adrenochrome is taken up by mitochondria in the myocardium [15]. Moreover, tubular channels from mitochondria to catecholamine-storage vesicles have been demonstrated in rat adrenal medullary tissue by high voltage electron microscopy [16]. These continuities, involving about 25% of the mitochondria, appeared to take the form of tubular extensions of the outer mitochondrial membrane that extend a variable distance in the cytoplasm and appeared to become continuous with the membrane of the catecholamine-storage vesicle. Carmichael and Smith [16] consider that such connections may also be present in other neuronal cells. Although their function has not been clearly explained, it was speculated that the continuities exist to provide a mechanism for two-way transfer of metabolites; therefore the possibility of catecholamines diVusing directly from the interior of the vesicle to the mitochondrial

intermembrane space should not be discarded. This observation is in connection with the notion that the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC,1 a major metabolite of dopamine) is expected to occur via the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases in the mitochondrial matrix [17], suggesting the possibility that catecholamine-derived oxidative products formed in vivo can actually come in contact with Complex I. Dopamine oxidative products can directly damage the mitochondrion by impairing the respiratory chain [18,19]. An impaired mitochondrial respiration will cause a decreased ATP production, which is absolutely necessary for the storage of catecholamines into the vesicles, further increasing the mitochondrial damage and eventually leading to cell death [20]. Particularly, dopamine-derived dopaminochrome promotes H2O2 release in respiring brain mitochondria, apparently by interacting exclusively at the level of Complex I. The eVect is visible at concentrations as low as 0.1­0.2 M and increases linearly with increasing the quinone concentration within values of physiological signiWcance [21]. In a previous study, Genova et al. [6] have employed adrenaline oxidation to detect superoxide formation by Complex I in bovine heart submitochondrial particles. During that study, we observed that the rate of adrenochrome formation, after an initial linear pattern, underwent an exponential increase. We have therefore decided to further investigate this phenomenon. In this study, we report that adrenochrome formed by adrenaline oxidation by superoxide undergoes a redox cycling in the presence of active Complex I with enhanced formation of superoxide and further adrenaline oxidation. Materials and methods Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma­Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO (USA). Mucidin (strobilurin A) was a kind gift from Dr. F. Nerud of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic. Bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) were prepared according to [22]. Where indicated, mucidin (1.8 M Wnal concentration) and rotenone (500 pmol/mg protein) were incubated with the particles for at least 5 min at ice temperature. For better eVectiveness of treatment, rotenone was added to the SMP suspension before dilution in the assay medium. NADH oxidase activity and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity (in the presence of mucidin and 60 M decylubiquinone, DB, as acceptor) were assayed spectrophotometrically at 25 °C, essentially as described in Genova et al. [23]; SMP (20 g/ml) were diluted in buVer solution at pH 7.8 (KCl 50 mM, Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, and KCN 1 mM when indicated).

NADH-adrenochrome oxidoreductase activity by Complex I was measured at 25 °C in mucidin-inhibited SMP (40 g/ml), diluted in the same assay medium and added with variable amounts of adrenochrome (25­500 M). The standard solution of adrenochrome was freshly prepared (6 mM in distilled water) and Wltered before use (0.2 m syringe Wlter, Nalgene®). The reaction was started using 75 M NADH as electron donor and was monitored following the rate of substrate oxidation at 340 minus 380 nm ( D 3.5 mM¡1 cm¡1) in a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlling system and a rapid mixing device (V-550 extended model, Jasco Europe, Cremella-LC, Italy). Reduction of acetylated ferricytochrome c was assayed following the absorbance changes at 550 minus 540 nm ( D 19.1 mM¡1 cm¡1). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer equipped with an NMR gaussmeter for Weld calibration and a Hewlett Packard 5350B microwave frequency counter for the determination of the g-factors, which were referenced to that of the perylene radical cation in concentrated H2SO4 (g D 2.00258). The experiment in the presence of active Complex I was performed at 25 °C by adding adrenochrome (3 mM) and NADH (20 mM) to rotenone-inhibited SMP (2 mg protein/ml) diluted in the assay medium (KCl 50 mM, Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, KCN 1 mM, mucidin 1.8 M, and pHMB 180 M, pH 7.8). Digitised ESR spectra were transferred to a personal computer for analysis using digital simulations carried out with a program developed in our laboratory and based on a Monte Carlo procedure [24]. Superoxide production was measured by exploiting the oxidation of adrenaline to adrenochrome induced by the superoxide radical [3]. SMP (650 g) were suspended in the assay medium at pH 7.8 (2500 l Wnal volume) and supplemented with appropriate substrates and inhibitors: 25 l epinephrine sodium bitartrate (110 mM solution in HCl 0.1 M, to be kept in ice and used within 1 h), 375 U catalase, 1.8 M mucidin, and 125 M NADH. Eventually, 100 U SOD and 250 M adrenochrome standard solution were added as described in the text. The rate of epinephrine oxidation was calculated monitoring the absorbance changes at 485 minus 575 nm ( D 2.96 mM¡1 cm¡1). High-resolution polarographic measurements were performed in a thermostatically controlled apparatus equipped with a Clark-type electrode and a mixing device (Oroboros Oxygraph, Paar, Graz, Austria). Results To functionally isolate superoxide (O2·¡) production by Complex I only, its formation by Complex III was prevented incubating SMP with 1.8 M mucidin, an inhibitor of centre o that at such concentration does not interfere with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity (data not shown). Measuring the O2·¡-dependent oxidation of adrenaline to adrenochrome in the presence of NADH, we

observed that the rate of adrenochrome formation increases as the reaction proceeds during the approximately 45 min monitoring time (Fig. 1). This behaviour can not be ascribed to a lag time that is due to the limited access of NADH to the enzyme, since there are no substrate permeability barriers in SMP and, furthermore, a second NADH addition yields a straight line. The activity is completely abolished by SOD. In our experimental conditions, it can be excluded that the above mentioned process is due to the spontaneous oxidation of adrenaline by molecular oxygen since baseline control was achieved during the assay by working at pH 7.8 [25], nor a participation of H2O2 in the reaction [26] can be identiWed since catalase was utilised in the assay mixture, whereas the ability of adrenochrome can not be neglected in undergoing a redox cycle, with further production of superoxide, when it is enzymatically reduced by Complex I [8]. We have therefore directly characterised the NADH-adrenochrome reductase activity of mucidininhibited SMP. The NADH-adrenochrome oxidoreductase activity in mucidin-inhibited SMP shows saturation kinetics by adrenochrome (Vmax D 0.701 mol/min/mg protein, Km D 357 M) and is not aVected by either rotenone or phydroxymercuribenzoate (pHMB) (Fig. 2), thus excluding that ubisemiquinone bound to Complex I is the site where adrenochrome is reduced to the corresponding radical anion. To conclusively support the formation of the adrenochrome radical anion by Complex I in SMP, we tried to identify this intermediate species by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. For comparison purposes the adrenochrome radical anion was initially generated in alkaline media by reduction with sodium dithionite. Fig. 3A shows the ESR spectrum of the radical anion of adrenochrome obtained by adding a water solution of Na2S2O4 (10 mM) to a basic solution (NaOH 0.1 M) of adrenochrome (10 mM) in a Xat quartz

cell at 25 °C. This spectrum was interpreted (Fig. 3B) on the basis of the coupling of the unpaired electron with one nitrogen nucleus (aN D 0.371 mT), with three equivalent protons (a3H D 0.482 mT) and with Wve unequivalent protons (aH D 0.054, 0.098, 0.242, 0.489, and 0.458 mT), consistently with the structure of the adrenochrome radical anion (g D 2.0040). The ESR experiment was repeated with adrenochrome in the presence of the enzyme, as described in Materials and methods. Under the above conditions (Fig. 3C), we observed a spectrum with a lower signal to noise ratio and a slightly diVerent line width, which, however, is not substantially diVerent from the spectrum attributed to the adrenochrome radical anion that was recorded in the presence of dithionite. Therefore, a direct evidence was produced that the formation of the adrenochrome semiquinone can be

induced by the NADH-supported oxidoreductase activity of Complex I. In the presence of respiratory chain inhibitors (rotenone, mucidin or KCN), stimulation of oxygen uptake in SMP is observed after addition of adrenochrome and saturating amounts of NADH (Vmax D 0.533 mol O2/min/mg protein, Km for adrenochrome D 395 M: it is noteworthy that these values are in line with those obtained measuring NADH adrenochrome oxidoreductase activity, see above) (Fig. 4). In the reaction, 75 M NADH is used to consume approx. 65 M O2 which is reasonable if oxygen is reduced monovalently and then two molecules of superoxide are converted to hydrogen peroxide by spontaneous dismutation, regenerating oxygen with an approximate 50% yield. Interest-

Rotenone-inhibited SMP (100 g protein) are suspended in buVer solution also containing 1.8 M mucidin, 180 M pHMB, and 1 mM cyanide. After exhaustion of NADH, a further addition restores oxygen uptake that is counteracted by catalase (375 U).

ingly in the same reaction, after the Wrst aliquot of NADH is consumed and a second aliquot is still being oxidised, addition of catalase causes a partial recovery of oxygen in the oxygraphic cell that is consistent with the assumed formation of superoxide anion, followed by its dismutation to hydrogen peroxide and subsequent degradation by catalase. We assessed the rate of superoxide formation, which is probably supported by the rapid reaction of oxygen with the adrenochrome semiquinone produced by Complex I in our assay conditions, by performing a spectrophotometric analysis in the presence of adrenaline. The addition of 250 M adrenochrome gives rise to a remarkable increase of both NADH and adrenaline oxidation (Fig. 5 left and right, respectively) to an extent larger than that observed in the initial portion of the traces, which is instead considered to represent true rates (left panel: 12.5; right panel: 2.1 nmol/min/mg protein) of the O2·¡ generated by Complex I itself through direct electron transfer to oxygen molecules. The high rate of adrenaline oxidation in the presence of adrenochrome is completely abolished by SOD, while the corresponding rate of NADH oxidation is insensitive to superoxide dismutase (Table 1). Acetylated ferricytochrome c is a quantitative trap for O2·¡ [27] but when added to SMP induced to produce superoxide by the NADH-adrenochrome activity, as in our experimental conditions, it is susceptible to reduction by the adrenochrome-derived semiquinone species more eVectively than by superoxide since the reaction is completely SOD-insensitive (Table 2). Besides the capacity of the adrenochrome semiquinone to rapidly react with oxygen forming the superoxide anion, as we have previously shown in this paper, we also demonstrated that the addition of 60 M acetylated ferricytochrome c can temporarily prevent the oxygen consumption occurring in the

Discussion In this study, we have shown that mitochondrial Complex I is able to catalyse the superoxide-dependent oxidation of adrenaline followed by redox cycling of the product, adrenochrome, which is reduced to an adrenochrome radical directly by Complex I, as we have demonstrated by ESR analysis. The process is eVected in multiple steps, i.e., (i) NADH-supported one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide, catalysed by Complex I; (ii) chemical oxidation of adrenaline by superoxide to yield adrenochrome and hydrogen peroxide; (iii) NADH-supported reduction of adrenochrome to its semiquinone form, catalysed by Complex I; (iv) auto-oxidation of adrenochrome semiquinone to regenerate adrenochrome and the superoxide radical; (v) further reaction of superoxide with adrenaline to generate additional adrenochrome molecules. This establishes a redox cycle with exponential increase of adrenochrome concentration. Complex I is therefore involved in the redox cycling of adrenaline/adrenochrome in two diVerent kinds of reactions: the initial generation of superoxide by an intrinsic process catalysed by the enzyme, and the reduction of adrenochrome (Fig. 7). We have approached the problem of the site(s) responsible for these reactions by functionally isolating Complex I in submitochondrial particles by adding mucidin at a concentration suYcient to inhibit Complex III, without aVecting Complex I activity [28].

conditions mucidin, at diVerence with antimycin A, does not enhance superoxide generation by Complex III [6], while slightly enhancing superoxide formation by Complex I, presumably due to the increased reduction state of the enzyme [29]. The two reactions catalysed by Complex I and establishing the redox cycling of adrenaline apparently involve diVerent components of the enzyme redox-active groups: in fact, while the formation of superoxide by Complex I is enhanced by rotenone [6], the reduction of adrenochrome is not aVected by the inhibitor. The identiWcation of the exact site of superoxide generation in Complex I is an important subject, but it has been very controversial. We have previously suggested that the site of escape of one electron with superoxide formation is at the level of an iron­sulphur cluster, presumably N2, since the rate of superoxide generation is enhanced by rotenone but is decreased by pHMB [6]. The results in [6] have been conWrmed in our laboratory (unpublished data) by spectrophotometric determination of acetylated ferricytochrome c reduction [27]; the rates of O2·¡ generation are three times higher in rotenone- than in mucidin-inhibited bovine heart SMP. Quite recently, our hypothesis was also supported by the work of Ohnishi et al. [30] indicating that under physiological conditions, in intact mitochondria, Complex I is well protected from oxygen by many subunit proteins therefore superoxide may be produced only around the quinone area. Nevertheless, as exempliWed by our present data, the site of the reduction of adrenochrome is situated upstream and it is likely coincident with a FMN, as already suggested [8], since the reaction is insensitive to both rotenone and pHMB. Although the redox cycling of adrenochrome is reminiscent of the behaviour of short-chain water-soluble ubiquinone homologues and analogues, such as Coenzyme Q1, that have been shown to enhance superoxide production by Complex I [6], superoxide production induced by these pbenzoquinone derivatives is enhanced by rotenone indicating that, at diVerence with adrenochrome, they act at or near the same site of electron escape in absence of quinones. The results of this study have important implications on the assay of superoxide produced by Complex I using the adrenaline­adrenochrome method. The kinetic constants of adrenochrome reduction by Complex I allow to conclude that adrenochrome accumulation during the assay would be able to induce a redox cycling with exponential increase of the formation of superoxide. Therefore, authors should be aware that this phenomenon becomes extremely signiWcant if long-term assays are to be used and they should perform the measurements during the very initial phase (0­ 60 s), before allowing adrenochrome to accumulate, to minimise erroneous information about actual rate of superoxide production by Complex I. The unsuitability of the adrenaline reaction for detecting superoxide has been also pointed out by Chen and Thakker in microsomes during cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of xenobiotics [31].

Moreover, the demonstration that Complex I, in mitochondria induced to produce superoxide as presented in our work, can establish a redox cycle with the oxidation products of adrenaline (and presumably other catecholamines as well), which causes an explosive enhancement of superoxide generation, may be of physiopathological relevance as in the endogenous scenario of dopaminergic neuronal death, i.e., in Parkinson's disease; it is tempting to speculate that mitochondria will be continuously exposed to quinone products derived from dopamine, leading to a progressively increasing impairment of the mitochondrial function by semiquinone-derived oxyradicals.
