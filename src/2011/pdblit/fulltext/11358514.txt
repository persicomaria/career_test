Human b-casomorphin-7 (NH2-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-ProIle-CO2H) is a naturally occurring peptide inhibitor of elastase that has been shown to form an acyl-enzyme complex stable enough for X-ray crystallographic analysis at pH 5. To investigate the importance of the N-terminal residues of the b-casomorphin-7 peptide for the inhibition of elastase, kinetic and crystallographic analyses were undertaken to identify the minimum number of residues required for effective formation of a stable complex between truncated b-casomorphin-7 peptides and porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). The results clearly demonstrate that significant inhibition of PPE can be effected by simple tri-, tetra-and pentapeptides terminating in a carboxylic

acid. These results also suggest that in vivo regulation of protease activity could be mediated via short peptides as well as by proteins. Crystallographic analysis of the complex formed between N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H   and PPE at pH 5 (to 1.67 A resolution) revealed an active site water molecule in an analogous position to that observed in the PPE/b-casomorphin-7 structure supportive of its assignment as the `hydrolytic water' in the deacylation step of serine protease catalysis. Keywords: acyl-enzyme; casomorphin; elastase enzyme inhibition; serine protease.

From both mechanistic and inhibitory viewpoints the serine and cysteine proteases are among the most studied of all enzymes. Elastases are a group of proteases that possess the ability to cleave the connective tissue protein elastin [1]. Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) represent two of the elastin-cleaving serine proteases. Neutrophil elastase is found in the dense granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes [2] and is involved in phagocytosis and defence against infection by invading microorganisms. Pancreatic elastase is stored as an inactive zymogen in the pancreas and is secreted into the intestine where it becomes activated by trypsin and then participates in digestion. Both elastases preferentially cleave substrates at peptide bonds where the P1 residue is an amino acid residue with a small alkyl side chain [3]. Although PPE and HNE cleave elastin, elastin is neither their only substrate nor necessarily their most important physiological substrate. Elastases have been implicated in a wide range of disease states as their activity is destructive if left

uncontrolled. In vivo, their activity is controlled by compartmentalization or by natural circulating plasma protease inhibitors. However, in the event of these regulatory mechanisms failing to work, diseases such as acute pancreatitis, pulmonary emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, thrombosis and stroke can occur [4±6]. Although there remain controversies with respect to certain detailed aspects, mechanistic proposals for the serine proteases still follow the outline of the `charge-relay' process proposed by Blow et al. [7] In this, a nucleophilic serine residue reacts with a noncovalent enzyme:substrate complex to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate via a tetrahedral intermediate. In the second mechanistic phase, this acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed via a second tetrahedral intermediate to a give a noncovalent enzyme:product complex. Pharmaceutical companies have searched for effective inhibitors of human, microbial and viral proteases, but achieving selectivity for a single member of the family can be a problem, possibly because many proteases have similar active site structures. Clearly successes have been achieved in the case of the aspartyl protease encoded for by HIV, but inhibitors of mammalian proteases have been slow to come into clinical use. Small molecule inhibitors for serine proteases may be classed as reversible or irreversible. A popular strategy for reversible inhibition has been to use a `transition state analogue' for the deacylation stage of the reaction. Such analogues have included peptides terminating in aldehydes [8], trifluoromethylketones [9] and boronic acids [10] at their C termini. Many classes of (essentially) irreversible inhibitors of serine proteases have also been developed, most commonly including acylating agents, for example, b-lactams [11,12]. A potential problem with the use of irreversibly binding inhibitors is that long-term exposure may cause toxicity via nonselective acylation within the human body.

for effective formation of a stable complex between truncated BCM7 peptides and PPE. The results clearly demonstrate that significant inhibition of PPE can be effected by a simple tripeptide terminating in a carboxylic acid. They suggest that reversible serine protease inhibitors using a `C-terminal' carboxylic acid could be developed. Use of a carboxylic acid may avoid toxicity problems associated with other functional groups such as aldehydes or trifluoromethylketones.

A mass spectrometric screen has identified an unmodified heptapeptide (NH2-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H), human b-casomorphin-7 (BCM7) [13], which formed an acyl±enzyme complex with PPE that was stable enough for crystallographic analysis at pH 5 [14]. The inhibitory activity observed was competitive and apparently specific to elastase with a Ki value of 0.76 mm with PPE. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the PPE/BCM7 complex identified the peptide as binding in the S subsites of PPE (Fig. 1). Ile7 of BCM7 was linked to Ser195 via an ester and its side-chain was bound in the S1 subsite indicating productive binding. The structure contained well-defined electron density for the four C-terminal residues of BCM7, Val-Glu-Pro-Ile. However there was no observable electron density for the three N-terminal residues, Tyr-Pro-Phe. This lack of electron density was ascribed to their disorder within the crystal lattice. The structure also identified a water molecule (Wat317) located over the ester linkage apparently poised for nucleophilic attack onto the ester carbonyl. It was suggested that Wat317 might represent the hydrolytic water molecule proposed by Blow et al. in the `charge-relay' mechanism [7]. The unusual stability of the acyl-enzyme complex revealed by this structure was reconciled with the weak competitive inhibition shown by the kinetics analysis through the suggestion that at the lower pH at which the crystals were grown (pH 5.0) compared to that of the kinetics analysis (pH 7.5) His57 would be protonated and thus unable to catalyse deacylation. Previous work had indicated the preferential binding of small nonpolar residues in the S1 ±S4 subsites of PPE [15]. Therefore the presence of an acidic residue at the P3 position made the facile binding of the BCM7 peptide to the PPE active site unusual. It was speculated that this may play a role in the increased relative stability of the PPE/ BCM7 complex compared with those formed by other small peptides. It particular it was suggested that it may be associated with an interaction between the acidic P3 residue, Glu5 of BCM7, and the side chain of Gln192 in PPE. In order to investigate the importance of the N-terminal residues of the BCM7 peptide for the inhibition of elastase, kinetic and X-ray crystallographic analyses were undertaken to identify the minimum number of residues required

Kinetic analyses were performed substantially as reported by Wilmouth et al. [14] Enzyme assays were conducted using a Shimadzu 1601PC spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatic multicell transport system. The hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, succinyl-AlaAla-Pro-Ala-p-nitroanilide, was measured at 405 nm, at a constant temperature of 25 8C in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5). PPE (0.5 mg; Serva Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used for each assay. Duplicate to quadruplicate measurements of the initial rate were taken at five or six substrate concentrations between a fifth and three times Km. Three to four inhibitor concentrations were used. Assignment of peptides as competitive inhibitors was made by plotting the data according to the methods of Lineweaver and Burke, Dixon and Cornish-Bowden. Data were analysed using standard kinetic equations programmed into grafit (Erithacus Software) and Excel 97 (Microsoft Inc.). The parameters Km and Vmax were calculated using an iterative least-squares fit to the Michaelis±Menten equation. Ki values were calculated from a plot of Km(app) against [I]. Human BCM7 and its N-terminally truncated derivatives were synthesized by automated solid phase synthesis using Fmoc chemistry. Deprotection was accomplished using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, water, thioanisol and 1,2-ethanedithiol (36 : 2 : 1 : 1). The peptides were purified using HPLC with a Hypersil C18 column eluting with a gradient from 10% to 100% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The presence of the desired peptides was confirmed by electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS and their purity was determined to be . 95% by 500 MHz 1H NMR. The peptide content was determined for the substrate by recording the absorbance at 405 nm after complete hydrolysis and for the casomorphin derivatives by amino-acid analysis. Crystal preparation and soaking PPE crystals were prepared overnight at 17 8C using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method [16]. A filtered (0.22 mm) solution (3 mL) of PPE (50 mg¥ml21) in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was mixed with 50 mm Na2SO4 well solution (3 mL). N-Acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H (17 mg¥mL21) was dissolved in a solution containing sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 50 mm), sodium sulphate (25 mm) and PPE (70 mg¥ml21). The mother liquor containing the crystals was exchanged with this solution in a stepwise manner over 4 h at 10 8C and left to equilibrate overnight. The solution was then exchanged

After 1 week soaking at 10 8C, the crystals were placed in a cryoprotectant solution [50 mm sodium acetate pH 5.0, 25 mm sodium sulphate, 35 mg¥mL21 N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H, 20% (v/v) glycerol] and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data collection and processing Data were collected at 100 K using beamline 9.6, SRS, Daresbury and a 300-mm image plate detector (Mar  Research) to a resolution of 1.67 A. The crystal belonged to     the space group P212121 with a  50.16 A, b  57.84 A   . Raw data were processed using the and c  74.32 A programs denzo and scalepack [17]. Data were 95.2%   complete (96.7% in the outer shell, 1.67±1.70 A) with 156137 total reflections of which 24944 were unique after reduction. Rmerge was 7.2% (25.0% in the outer shell,   1.67±1.70 A) and I/sI was 15.0 (10.0 in the outer   shell, 1.67±1.70 A). Structure refinement   The 1.65 A native PPE structure obtained by Meyer et al. [16] was used as the starting model. The structures were refined using a combination of refmac v.4 and 5 (CCP4 suite [18]), shelxl-97 [19] and cns [20]. A total of 4% of the reflections in the entire dataset were randomly selected to provide a test set for the Rfree calculations [21]. These reflections were kept separate during refinement, but were included in the electron density map calculations. Models and electron density maps were displayed with the program o [22]. At the stage in refinement when the Fo ±Fc maps showed clear and unambiguous density corresponding to the N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H peptide, it was included in the model. The ester bond was simulated only with a bond length restraint and no extra angle or planarity restraints were placed on the ester carbonyl. During the latter stages of refinement, 233 water molecules were added along with the bound calcium and sulphate ions [16] to give a final R factor of 15.8% and a free R factor of 19.9%. There were no unusual outliers in the Ramachandran plot, and the final Fo ±Fc difference maps did not demonstrate any large areas of unexplained electron density. The average B factor for     the protein was 13.9 A2 and for the peptide it was 38.3 A2. There appeared to be no significant conformational change of the backbone of the protein upon peptide binding which   was confirmed by the small r.m.s. difference of 0.11 A for the Ca atoms between this structure and that of native PPE.

Kinetic analyses Removal of the N-terminal tyrosine of BCM7 to give NH2-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H led to a significant decrease in inhibitory activity of the peptide from a Ki of 0.76 mm to 2.1 mm (Table 1). Removal of both the tyrosine and proline from the N terminus to give NH2-PheVal-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H caused an overall decrease in inhibitory activity but less so than the removal of the tyrosine alone (Ki  1.4 mm). Further truncation of

residues from the N terminus of BCM7 to give the tetrapeptide, NH2-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H, and tripeptide, NH2-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H, led to similar levels of inhibitory potency (Ki  1.2 and 1.3 mm, respectively). However the dipeptide, NH2-Pro-Ile-CO2H, was inactive consistent with previous research by Thompson et al. which showed that a minimum of three residues is required for effective binding to the active site of PPE [23]. In analysing peptides with a `reduced' number of residues at the N terminus, a positively charged amino terminus is necessarily introduced into the active site of PPE. To nullify a potentially deleterious ionic interaction, peptides were synthesized with an N-acetyl group to provide a neutral N-terminus. Whereas the presence of an N-acetyl group led to little difference in the inhibitory activity of the hexapeptide, N-acetyl-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-ProIle-CO2H, acetylation of the pentapeptide, N-acetyl-PheVal-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H, caused a decrease in the inhibitory activity (the Ki increased from 1.4 mm to 2.7 mm) (Table 1). However in the case of the acetylated tetrapeptide, N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H, and tripeptide, N-acetyl-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H, addition of an N-acetyl group resulted in an increase in inhibitory potency and a decrease in the Ki value to a similar level to that observed for BCM7 itself. It was considered possible that the lower activity observed for the unacetylated hexapeptide may reflect an unfavourable interaction with its N-terminal amino group, but activity for the acetylated hexapeptide was still less that that of BCM7 suggesting that this was due to some other factor, such as conformational constraints imposed by the N-terminal proline. Whilst it is possible that the N-terminal tyrosine in BCM7 makes a previously unidentified interaction with a `S7 subsite', it seems that its effect is more likely to be due to another factor such as altering the conformation of the peptide perhaps by changing the cis/ trans isomer ratio of the Pro±Phe amide link. Atlas et al. postulated in 1973 that the elastase active site only required the subsites S5 ±S3 H for efficient catalysis of peptide hydrolysis [24]. The kinetic results described here are consistent with this proposal and demonstrate that significant inhibition of a serine protease can be effected by a simple tetra- or tripeptide with a carboxylic acid at its C terminus. The visualization of the acyl-enzyme complex between BCM7 and PPE identified only four of the seven residues in the active site. The remaining three N-terminal residues were thought to be disordered in the crystal lattice,

suggesting that only four subsites are required for activity by BCM7 [14]. The kinetic analyses presented in this paper have demonstrated that acetylated tri-(N-acetylGlu-Pro-Ile-CO2H) and tetrapeptides (N-acetyl-Val-GluPro-Ile-CO2H) are sufficient to maintain the inhibitory activity displayed by BCM7. The presence of the acetyl group appears to be necessary to prevent the positively charged N-terminus from having a negative effect on binding, although it cannot be ruled out that there is a specific interaction with the acetyl group. Crystallization of N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H with PPE confirmed that this peptide bound in a manner analogous to that of BCM7 (see below). These results confirm that the three N-terminal residues, not visible in the BCM7 structure, are unnecessary for stabilization of the PPE/BCM7 complex. X-ray crystallographic studies The electron density map for the PPE/N-acetyl-Val-GluPro-Ile-CO2H complex is consistent with the location of the four amino acid residues of the peptide in the S1 ±S4 subsites of PPE. They form an antiparallel b sheet with Ser214 and Val216 in a manner analogous to that observed in the PPE/BCM7 complex [14] which is indicative of productive binding (Fig. 1). There is clear electron density for the C-terminal isoleucine of the peptide inhibitor and continuous density between its C terminus and the side chain of Ser195 consistent with the formation of an ester linkage. As in the PPE/BCM7 structure, the carbonyl oxygen of peptide C-terminal isoleucine is located in the

oxyanion hole within hydrogen bonding distance of the main chain NH groups of Ser195 and Gly193 (2.68 and   3.05 A, respectively). The structure was refined without additional angle or planarity restraints on the ester bond which led to the carbon atom of the ester carbonyl being slightly pyramidized. However, whilst this is suggestive of   a strained ester, both the resolution (1.67 A) and the quality of the electron density in this region of the structure mean that the distortion of the ester from planarity cannot be certain. Attempts to overcome this uncertainty by a very high resolution structure are in progress. The electron density for the P2 proline ring is much weaker than for the P1 isoleucine with some disorder being apparent. The shallow S2 subsite of PPE is less well-defined than the S1 pocket and this may be associated with the observed disorder of the proline residue. Alternatively, it is possible that this disorder is related to the lower occupancy level of N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H (which was soaked into the PPE crystals) compared to the peptide in the cocrystallized PPE/BCM7 structure. As with BCM7, the side chain of the glutamic acid residue in N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H is in position to form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Gln192   (2.87 A) (Fig. 2). However, as in the PPE/BCM7 structure, the electron density for this residue is relatively weak and care must be taken in assigning the presence or absence of a hydrogen bond at this position. Although the electron density map is consistent with good occupancy of the valine residue of N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H in the hydrophobic S4 subsite, there is no electron density visible for the acetyl group on the N-terminus of the peptide. To

investigate the apparent absence of the acetyl group, several of the PPE/N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H crystals were dissolved and subjected to ESI-MS analysis (data not shown). No evidence was found for the cleavage of the acetyl group of the peptide either in the crystal or in solution. Thus, the lack of visualization of the acetyl group is analogous to the inability to visualize the three N-terminal residues of BCM7. Although it is plausible for three amino acids to exist in a state of such disorder as to be unobservable in the crystal structure, it is surprising that electron density for the small acetyl group is not visible. A feature of the PPE/BCM7 structure was the identification of a water molecule, Wat317, located above the ester carbonyl. An analogous water molecule is present in the PPE/N-acetyl-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-CO2H structure, Wat532,   within hydrogen bonding distance of His57 (2.98 A) and appears to be positioned for deacylation of Ser195 (Fig. 2). The existence of a water molecule above the ester carbonyl lends credence to the suggestion that this may be the position occupied by the hydrolytic water molecule during deacylation. Thus, the present work seems to confirm that the presence of a water in this position is not an artefact but is the first `accurate' visualization of the hydrolytic water molecule proposed to exist in the mechanism of Blow [7]. In both the PPE/BCM7 and PPE/N-acetyl-Val-Glu-ProIle-CO2H structures the electron density maps are consistent with a hydrogen bonding interaction occurring between the peptide glutamic acid and Gln192 of PPE, with     distances of < 3.2 A and 2.9 A. It is uncertain to what extent the presence of a hydrogen bond between the P3 residue and Gln192 stabilized the enzyme:inhibitor complex. However, this interaction does not exist in any other reported peptidic elastase:inhibitor complexes as these previously described inhibitors generally have contained small, nonpolar residues at the P3 or equivalent position which are unable to form hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that this putative hydrogen bond does not explain the weak inhibitory activity of BCM7 against HNE as, with this form of elastase, residue 192 is a phenylalanine. It is interesting that the presence of a hydrogen bond between the glutamic acid residue of the peptide and Gln192 forms a `loop' within the active site between both enzyme and peptide residues. It is possible that formation of this `loop' may be a factor in stabilizing the acyl-enzyme complexes. In addition to simply reinforcing other binding interactions, it is possible that distortion of the active site away from optimal catalytic deacylation occurs, e.g. by altering the conformation of Ser195 and/or the oxyanion hole, thereby affecting the stereoelectronics of hydrolysis. There is no evidence for distortion of the active site triad or oxyanion hole in the crystal structures (when compared to native PPE structures) to give credence to this hypothesis. However, kinetically labile intermediates/conformations may well not be apparent in a `thermodynamically' determined crystal form. Further investigations, aimed at capturing labile intermediates using time- or pH-resolved crystallography [25], will be of interest. The present study further supports the assignment of a position for the hydrolytic water molecule during serine protease catalysis made by studies on the complex formed between BCM7 and PPE. The work also opens the way for optimization of the activity of protease inhibitors containing carboxylic acids that react reversibly with elastase. It

also suggests that in vivo regulation of protease activity may be mediated via small peptides as well as by proteins. It is possible that such low molecular weight peptide inhibitors have been overlooked previously as it may be difficult to identify them against a background of very similar molecules.
