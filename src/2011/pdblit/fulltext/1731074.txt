The conformation in water of antimicrobial protein 2 from Amaranthus caudatus (Ac-AMP2) was determined using 1H NMR, DIANA and restrained molecular modeling. Ac-AMP2 is a 30 amino acid residue, lectin-like protein that specifically binds to chitin, a polymer of b-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. After sequence specific resonance assignments, a total of 198 distance restraints were collected from 2D NOESY buildup spectra at 500 MHz at pH 2, supplemented by a 2D NOESY spectrum at 600 MHz. The location of the three previously unassigned disulfide bridges was determined from preliminary DIANA structures, using a statistical analysis of intercystinyl distances. The solution structure of Ac-AMP2 is presented as a set of 26 DIANA structures, further refined by restrained molecular dynamics using a simulated annealing protocol in the AMBER force field, with a backbone r.m.s.d. for the well defined Glu3-Cys28 segment of 0.69(20.12) Å. The main structural element is an antiparallel b-sheet from Met13 to Lys23 including a bI-turn over Gln17-Phe18 with a b bulge at Gly19. In addition, a b' turn over Arg6-Gly7, I a b'II turn over Ser11-Gly12 and a helical turn from Gly24 to Cys28 are I identified. This structure is very similar to the equivalent regions of the X-ray structure of wheat germ agglutinin and the NMR structure of hevein.

classes of short, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides (Cammue et al., 1992; Terras et al., 1992, 1993). Recently, two small (29 and 30 residues) basic proteins named Ac-AMP1 and Ac-AMP2, with strong antifungal and antimicrobial properties were isolated from the seeds of love-lies-bleeding, Amaranthus caudatus (Broekaert et al., 1992). They are probably involved in the protection of seeds or seedlings against fungi and microorganisms. Although presently uncertain, the mode of action is most probably related to the fact that they can bind to chitin, a polymer of b-1,4-N-acetyl-Dglucosamine. This binding, as measured by the adsorption behavior on chitin packed microcolumns, is reversible and pH controlled, with binding at neutral pH and dissociation at pH 2.8 or lower. We focus on Ac-AMP2 which contains one arginyl residue more at the C terminus compared to Ac-AMP1. Initial investigation of the protein-carbohydrate interaction by 1H-NMR titration studies

of Ac-AMP2 with N,N ',N "-triacetyl chitotriose showed a specific binding with an association constant at 315 K of 200 l mol-1 at pH 2 and of 1000 l mol-1 at pH 7 (Verheyden et al., 1995). While considerably shorter, the Ac-AMP sequences display considerable sequence homology with the cystinyl/glycyl-rich sequence of hevein and the hevein-like domains in a variety of proteins (Figure 1). These contain 40 to 45 amino acid residues including eight conserved half-cystine residues whose four disulfide bridge pattern is referred to as the ``toxin-agglutinin fold'', or more commonly ``hevein fold''. The latter stems from the fact that the small protein hevein (isolated from rubber tree latex) shares a high degree of homology with these domains and can be considered to be a single domain protein, binding chitin (Rodriguez et al., 1986). Structure determinations of hevein by 1 H NMR (Andersen et al., 1993; Asensio et al., 1995) and of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) by X-ray diffraction (Wright, 1987, 1989, 1990; Wright & Jaeger, 1993) show that these hevein domains have identical disulfide bridge pairing as well as very similar tertiary structures, indicating that the sequence homology translates itself into a common structural organization. For Ac-AMP2 however, the important deletions in the sequence (including two half-cystine residues) and the unknown disulfide bridge pattern, raise questions as to its structural organization and its similarity with the ``regular'' hevein domains. Also, the small size of this protein makes it particularly suitable to study the protein-carbohydrate interaction by NMR without the need for isotopic labeling. We report the complete sequence-specific resonance assignment of Ac-AMP2, the assignment of the disulfide bridge pairing and the structure determination at pH 2 and 288 K. The disulfide bridges were determined from a statistical analysis of intercystinyl Cb distances in a set of preliminary conformers by the method of Klaus et al. (1993). The structure of Ac-AMP2 in solution is presented as a set of 26 conformers with average pairwise r.m.s.d. (further referred to as ° r.m.s.d.) of 0.69(20.12) A for the backbone atoms

Results
Resonance assignment and secondary structure Complete sequence-specific resonance assignments were obtained according to the sequential assignment procedure of Wuthrich (1986), using ¨ a combination of 2D HOHAHA and 2D NOESY spectra at 288 K, i.e. under conditions where the best dispersion of amide 1H resonances occurs. Residual overlap was resolved from analogous spectra recorded at 303 K. In most cases the good dispersion of the backbone 1H resonances allowed us to identify at least two characteristic NOEs between neighboring residues, leading to a continuous stretch of sequential NOEs over the whole sequence (Figure 2). The presence of strong sequential CaH-Cdd'H NOEs in both Xxx-Pro dipeptides unambiguously establishes the trans geometry of the peptide bonds involved. From the NMR data summarized in Figure 2 an antiparallel b-sheet from Met13 till Lys23 can be recognized as the main secondary structure element in Ac-AMP2. This is particularly evident from the interstrand aHi -NHj (Met13-Gly24, Cys15-Gly22), NHi -NHj (Cys14-Gly22, Ser16-Tyr20) and NHi -aHj (Cys14-Lys23, Ser16-Cys21) NOE contacts. The antiparallel nature of the sheet is revealed by the typical interstrand aHi -aHj (Met13-Lys23, Cys15Cys21) NOEs. The presence of several medium range NOEs in the remainder of the structure suggests that it consists mainly of loops and turns. A total of 198 distance restraints, distributed over 62 intraresidual, 77 sequential, 22 medium range (=i - j =E5) and 37 long range restraints, were extracted from the NOESY spectra at 500 and 600 MHz. Their distribution over the sequence is shown in Figure 3. Importantly, several long range

The restraints are specified as follows: filled, intraresidual; dotted, sequential; cross-hatched, mediumrange (=i - j =E5); open, long range restraints.

NOEs are present between the N-terminal tetrapeptide and the second half of the sequence, indicating that Ac-AMP2 adopts a folded conformation. Assignment of the disulfide bridges Prior to this study, the disulfide bridge arrangement of Ac-AMP2 was not reported. Our first attempt to elucidate it from intercystinyl NOE data (Klaus et al., 1993) failed, because of the mutual overlap between the b 1H resonances of cystinyl and other residues, as well as the low number of intercystinyl NOEs, even at 600 MHz. Moreover, their interpretation is compromised by the vicinity of the Cys14 and Cys15 residues which can give rise to NOEs between unpaired cystinyl residues. Our strategy (Martins et al., 1995) consists of deriving a maximum number of stereospecific assignments for b-methylene protons and subsequently assigning the disulfide bridges from a set of conformers calculated without imposing any disulfide bond. The improved definition of the x1 angle resulted in a higher structural precision (Guntert et al., 1989), especially in the spatial ¨ location of the cystinyl sulfur atoms (Sg ). Our successful disulfide bridge assignment of Ac-AMP2 started from the initial stereospecific assignments obtained for Cys14, Phe18 and Lys23 with HABAS (Guntert et al., 1989). For another eight ¨ residues (out of 17), including three cystinyl and all aromatic ones, the NMR data processed by HABAS produced non-degenerate ranges of f, c, and x1 angles for each stereospecific assignment. This enabled diastereotopic discrimination of b-methylene protons for Cys4, Gln17, Tyr20, Tyr27 and Cys28, using a variant of the method of Widmer et al. (1989; see Materials and Methods).

The assignment of the disulfide bridges and all further structure calculations were achieved on a set of conformers computed with the structural restraints, including dihedral angles and these stereospecific assignments. No forced disulfide bridge pairing between cystinyl side-chains was allowed: 48 conformers with residual target ° function E2.0 A2 were selected: they displayed a ° mutual backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.03(20.25) A, no ° distance violation larger than 0.5 A and no bad van der Waals contacts. Next, a Gaussian distribution function (Klaus et al., 1993) was used to assign a probability wij , averaged over all 48 conformers, for a given disulfide bridge to occur in each of them, on the basis of the corresponding intercystinyl Cbi­Cbj distance. The Gaussian width of the probability distribution was set equal to the averaged pairwise cystinyl Cb-atom r.m.s.d. of ° 0.83(20.17) A in the 48 conformers. Values corresponding to 0.83(22 × 0.17) were chosen to define the distribution width ranges used for the assignment. Subsequently, the probability P(wij ) for each disulfide bridge pattern to occur within each of the 48 conformers was determined by multiplying the averaged probabilities wij of the three individual disulfide bridges of the pattern. For Ac-AMP2, eight cystinyl pairs have significant weight (wij > 0.3), while seven have negligible weights (wij < 0.01). Multiplying the weights according to each of the 15 disulfide bridge patterns conceivable in Ac-AMP2, yields a non-vanishing probability P(wij ) for three patterns (labeled I, II and III, see Figure 4) only. Being common to these three patterns, the disulfide bridge Cys14-Cys28 is logically assigned. Pattern I (Cys4-Cys15, Cys9Cys21, Cys14-Cys28) displayed the highest weight, irrespective of the choice of the Gaussian distribution width. In order to complete the disulfide bridge assignment, the mean Sgi­Sgj distances in the patterns, which should tend to the ideal value of

° 2.1 A, were considered (Figure 4). Clearly, the shortest mean Sgi­Sgj distances are found for pattern ° I (ca 3.5 to 4.0 A), while both II and III include one disulfide bridge with an average Sgi­Sgj distance ° exceeding 5.0 A (Cys4-Cys21 for II and Cys4-Cys9 ° for III) and one exceeding 6.0 A (Cys9-Cys15 for II and Cys15-Cys21 for III). We conclude that the disulfide bridge pattern I is the only one in good overall agreement with the set of conformers calculated from the NMR data. In this way, we demonstrate that this pattern is common to Ac-AMP2 and the homologous parts of hevein as well as WGA. Structure calculation and refinement The final structure calculation using DIANA and REDAC was performed with the restraints resulting from the disulfide bridge assignment described above. Within the first 100 calculated conformers, no clear jump could be detected in the final target function value or in the violation statistics. Therefore we arbitrarily selected all conformers ° with target function value E1.75 A2 (i.e. 35 in all) for further restrained energy refinement. From this set only the 26 conformers in which the Sg atom ° pairs were within bonding distance (2.0 to 2.1 A) were selected. The survey of the statistics of residual violations of experimental restraints is shown in Table 1. Discarding the first and last two residues, whose conformation turns out to be ill-defined, the r.m.s.d. values (Table 2) indicate that the conformers converge to the same overall fold. ° The value of 0.63(20.17) A for the backbone r.m.s.d. ° for the heavy atoms r.m.s.d. in and 1.58(20.15) A the Glu3-Cys28 segment, as well as the absence of ° large violations (>0.5 A or 10°) in the experimental restraints and the absence of significant steric repulsion, are indicative of a good quality structure.

Figure 5. Stereo view of the 26 conformers representing the solution conformation of Ac-AMP2 in solution. Conformers 2 to 26 were superimposed for minimum r.m.s.d. of the backbone atoms of residues 3 to 28 with conformer 1. Black lines represent the backbone atoms, gray lines the disulfide bridges. For clarity, the N and C-terminal residues 1-2 and 29-30 are not displayed. The structure features the Cys4-Cys15, Cys9-Cys21 and Cys14-Cys28 disulfide bridges from top to bottom.

(Table 1) are small, indicating the conformers were not distorted to agree with the restraints. Upon refinement, the average (3-28)-backbone r.m.s.d. ° ° increases from 0.63(20.17) A to 0.69(20.12) A, but improves for the core of the structure, i. e. from ° ° 0.49(20.15) A to 0.39(20.08) A for the (13-23)-backbone in the b-sheet (Table 2). Comparison of the conformers before and after refinement yields a ° mean r.m.s.d. value of 1.06(20.17) A for the (3-28) backbone. The deviations from the original conformers result from small local changes spread out over the entire structure. For the antiparallel b-sheet, where many NOEs are available, the shift ° in the atomic positions (0.6620.13 A) is significantly smaller, and yields an improvement in hydrogen bond geometry. Careful analysis of the distribution in f and c angle order parameters S u (Hyberts et al., 1992) shows that regions in the structure with high order are generally well conserved upon refinement. The initial low S u of the c, f dihedral angle pairs over the peptide bonds of Phe18-Gly19 and Lys23-Gly24 is significantly improved (S u > 0.95) by elimination of energetically unfavorable conformations. As a result, the (17-19)° backbone r.m.s.d. drops from 0.36(20.27) A to ° 0.13(20.04) A. This accounts for the drop in the backbone r.m.s.d. of the whole sheet. Overall, a much smoother distribution of the local conformations is observed over the set of 26 energyrefined conformers. This set is representative for the solution structure of Ac-AMP2 and will be used as a basis to the subsequent discussion. Description of the structure The set of 26 conformers representing the solution structure of Ac-AMP2 is shown in Figure 5. It indicates the overall quality of the structure, while giving an impression of its main features. The main structural element in Ac-AMP2 is a twisted antiparallel b-sheet composed of two strands, Met13 to Ser16 and Tyr20 to Lys23, interconnected

by a b-turn centered around Gln17 and Phe18. The b-sheet takes part in all three disulfide bridges, whereby the distribution of half-cystinyl residues over the b-sheet causes the segments preceding and following it to be strapped to its opposite sides (Figure 5). The S u values (Hyberts et al., 1992) for f, c, x1 and x2 show that most residues display high order parameters for the backbone. Exceptions are the N and C-terminal dipeptides. All residues with a well defined backbone conformation (Se0.95) are located within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. As evidenced by Figures 5 and 6(a), the sheet displays an appreciable amount of right-handed twist, especially in the residues surrounding the b-turn. The latter, centered around the Gln17-Phe18 dipeptide, adopts a bI turn conformation as deduced from their average (f, c) angle pairs ((-65°, -22°) and (-94°, 6°), respectively). The left-handed helical backbone conformation (75°, 9°) of Gly19 is followed by Tyr20, whose f, c angles generate a strong right-handed twist (-93°, -166°) indicative of a b-bulge at the beginning of the second strand (Richardson & Richardson, 1989). This b-bulge compensates the opposite twists of the antiparallel b-strands and the bI-turn, at the expense of a greatly accentuated right-handed twist for Tyr20. The latter is matched by the polyproline-like conformation (-63°, 168°) of Ser16, the residue opposite the b-bulge. During structure calculations, hydrogen bonds identified from a combined analysis of H/2H exchange and NOE data were not enforced. This allows an unbiased assessment of the NOE derived structure, by matching the amide H/2H exchange data against the persistence of the hydrogen bonding network observed over all conformers (Table 3). Most hydrogen bonds expected to occur in an antiparallel b-sheet are well represented over the 26 conformers (100% persistent), and are all supported by slowed H/2H exchange rates. The network of alternating pairs of hydrogen bonds between the peptide bonds on opposite strands:

For Ac-AMP2, the persistence of the hydrogen bonds is given. a For hevein and WGA a cross indicates the corresponding hydrogen bonds are also observed. Residue numbers of AcAMP2 have to be increased by 3 to obtain the corresponding hevein or WGA numbering, except for Cys4 in Ac-AMP2, which corresponds to Cys3 in hevein and WGA. b Hydrogen bonds given for WGA are present in the four homologous domains. c Persistence is expressed as the percentage of conformers in which the specified hydrogen bond meets the usual specifications (Williamson et al., 1985). d See the legend to Figure 2. e This region corresponds to a four residue gap in Ac-AMP2 and is not included in the comparison with hevein and WGA.

Figure 6. Stereo views highlighting various parts of the stucture of Ac-AMP2. Black lines represent the backbone atoms, gray lines the side-chains, only heavy atoms are shown for clarity. Conformers 2 to 26 were superimposed with conformer 1 for minimum r.m.s.d. of the backbone atoms of the selected residues: (a) the b-sheet residues Met13 to Lys23; (b) the backbone of the Val5 to Met13 segment including the b' , turn at Val5 to Arg8 and the b'II I I turn at Pro10 to Met13; (c) the C-terminal helical turn involving Pro25 to Cys28.

Cys14 NH-Gly22 CO, Cys14 CO-Gly22 NH, Ser16 NH-Tyr20 CO is only disrupted at the carbonyl group of Ser16, which is involved in a hydrogen bond with the amide of Gly19 instead of Lys20. This inserts an extra residue between the hydrogen bonds with Ser16 (Figure 6(a)). The unexpected slow H/2H exchange rate of the Tyr20 amide can be explained in terms of a hydrogen bond to the Og atom of the Ser16 side-chain. It is observed in 69% of the conformers and correlates with a x1060° (Figure 6(b)). As this hydrogen bond is impossible for x10-60° and 180°, it provides a strong indication this side-chain does adopt the gauche+ conformation. On the basis of the location of the b-sheet in the sequence, one would expect considerable to fast exchange for the amide protons not involved in interstrand hydrogen bonding. Although this is the

case for Cys15, Glu17 and Phe18, significantly reduced exchange rates are observed for Met13 (vide infra), Cys21 and Lys23 (Figure 2). For Cys21, the amide proton seems to be buried from the solvent, with a fractional solvent-accessible surface area (with respect to a Gly-Cys-Gly tripeptide) ° measured with a probe radius of 1.4 A of only 0.005. 2 Only the slowed H/ H exchange of Lys23 cannot be explained in terms of hydrogen bonds or solventaccessible surface area. At the C terminus, the backbone following the sheet adopts a four-residue helical turn such that i, i + 3 and i, i + 4 hydrogen bonds occur between the carbonyl residue of Gly24 and the amide of Tyr27 and Cys28. This explains the slowed exchange rates observed for these amide protons (Table 3). The hydrogen bond appearing in the conformers between Pro25 CO and Gly29 NH is not supported by a slowed exchange rate. This suggests that the location of Gly29 at the C terminus makes its conformation considerably more flexible. Although the (3-13)-backbone r.m.s.d. is higher than that of the sheet, both this part of the structure, and its position with respect to the sheet are still well defined (Table 2). The backbone of the Pro10-Met13 segment is consistent with a b'II-turn I over Ser11-Gly12. The associated hydrogen bond between Met13 NH­Pro10 CO explains the slow H/2H exchange observed for Met13. The Arg8 to Pro10 segment adopts an extended conformation more or less parallel with the b-sheet. It is preceded by a b'-turn centered around Arg6-Gly7 which I changes the direction of the backbone. This brings

328 Cys4 and Cys9 into the right orientation to form the corresponding disulfide bridges with Cys15, respectively Cys21 on the b-sheet. The Gly2-Glu3Cys4 tripeptide, crossing the sheet at Tyr20 and Cys21, appears as a third short strand, antiparallel to the second strand. This is suggested by several short interproton contacts (Figure 2) and the corresponding ``interstrand'' Cys4 NH­Gly19 CO hydrogen bond expected in this case; the latter is present in all conformers and explains the slowed H/2H exchange observed for Cys4 NH (Table 3). The small size of this ``strand'' and its steep angle with the b-sheet argue against defining the whole as a triple-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. It brings the Val1 side-chain to the other side of the b-sheet, in the vicinity of the aromatic moiety of Tyr20. As both b-turns are DD preferred, Arg6 and Ser11 have to adopt a rather unusual but allowed La conformation (Figure 6(b)). Both are confirmed by the occurrence of equal intensity intraresidue and sequential daN NOEs, as well as a sequential dNN NOE (Andersen et al., 1993). The hydrogen bonds observed between Val5 and Arg8 are both supported by the low H/2H exchange rates. The somewhat faster exchange for Arg8 NH versus Val5 NH, reflects a more unfavorable geometry for the corresponding Arg8 NH­Val5 CO hydrogen bond, as judged from the low persistence.

Solution Structure of Ac-AMP2

Discussion
The overall tertiary structure of Ac-AMP2 consists of a centrally located, twisted anti-parallel b-sheet, which acts as the core of the protein and is more or less covered by the rest of the protein (Figure 5). From the location of the disulfide bridges in the structure it is evident that they are essential in stabilizing this fold (Figure 5). In this respect, the exact location of the cystinyl residues in the b-sheet appears crucial. Indeed, the location of Cys15 and Cys21 opposite to one another in the sheet, places their side-chains on the same side (Figure 6(a)). In contrast the sequential location of Cys14 and Cys15 in the first strand implies their side-chains are directed towards opposite sides of the b-sheet plane (Figure 6(a)). As a result, the corresponding disulfide bridges anchor the N and C-terminal parts of the protein to opposite sides of the b-sheet (Figure 5). As discussed below, this fold is essentially the same as that observed in the available structures of other hevein-like domains. Comparison with hevein and the hevein domains in WGA As mentioned in the Introduction, Ac-AMP2 displays significant homology to hevein, and to the 40 to 45-residue hevein domains in a variety of proteins (Figure 1). However, it is distinct from these ``regular'' hevein domains, by its considerably shorter sequence. Alignment with the six conserved half-cystine residues shows Ac-AMP2 lacks a C-terminal portion of about ten residues, including

the fourth disulfide bridge. In addition, correct sequence alignment of the N-terminal cystinyl residue necessitates a four-residue gap between Arg6 and Gly7. To assess the effects of these deletions, the structure of Ac-AMP2 is compared with hevein and WGA, available from the Brookhaven PDB (Abola et al., 1987; Bernstein et al., 1977) under accession codes 1HEV and 9WGA, respectively. The X-ray structure of isolectins I and II and the corresponding carbohydrate complexes of WGA have been studied in detail (Wright, 1989, 1990; Wright & Jaeger, 1993). In short, the WGA monomer consists of four consecutive hevein domains (referred to as A, B, C and D, see Figure 1), with two monomers associating in a ``head-to-tail'' arrangement to form a homodimer. The individual domains show a sequence homology of about 50% to each other, and the mutual backbone r.m.s.d. for the individual hevein domains ranges from 0.59 to ° 0.93 A. More recently, the structure of hevein has been elucidated by NMR in a water/dioxan mixture (Andersen et al., 1993) and in water (Asensio et al., 1995), and found to be similar to the individual hevein domains in WGA. In the following, a numbering is used for all hevein domains, based on the sequence alignment with Ac-AMP2 (Figure 1). Notwithstanding the deletions mentioned above, comparison of the backbone f, c angles of Ac-AMP2 with hevein and the hevein domains of WGA indicate that the tertiary structure of Ac-AMP2 in the Cys9 to Cys28 segment is actually very similar. The resulting aver° age r.m.s.d. of 1.07(20.10) A for hevein and ° 1.06(20.08) A over all the hevein domains in WGA are indicative of a good fit (Figure 7(a),(b)). The common fold includes the bIII , turn (Pro10 to Met13), the antiparallel b-sheet including the b-bulge, and the short helical fragment (Pro25 to Gly29). Importantly, the hydrogen bonding network in this fold is also conserved, as all hydrogen bonds observed in the fragment (Cys9 to Cys28) of Ac-AMP2 are also found in both WGA and hevein (Table 3). Also, the side-chain of the Ser16 residue in hevein and WGA adopts a gauche+ conformation, as discussed above. On the other hand, the N-terminal Glu3 to Arg8 segment of Ac-AMP2 has a drastically different conformation, as expected from the four-residue gap (see above). In AcAMP2, this results in the replacement of the extended loop by the shorter Val5 to Arg8 b-turn (Figure 7(a)). This is necessary to bring Cys4 in the correct orientation to form the disulfide bridge with Cys15. The structure of Ac-AMP2 ends with the helical turn at the C terminus. The 33-43 segment in the regular hevein domains, which folds back onto the antiparallel b-sheet (Figure 7(a)) is thus completely absent. As this does not hamper the chitin binding in Ac-AMP2, these residues are not involved in carbohydrate recognition. This correlates well with the observation that these residues are only involved in interactions with the N-terminal loop in

329 glance quite different, both the N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) and the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine sugar units satisfy the stereochemical requirements for binding (Wright, 1984, 1987). Both have an equatorial N-acetyl group and an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group. As both terminal non-reducing sugar rings are identically oriented in the binding site (Wright, 1990) we use the NeuLac-WGA complex for further comparison. Here the proteincarbohydrate interaction involves the B domain of each WGA monomer in a primary role, and the C

the subsequent domain in the same WGA monomer (Wright, 1987).

The sugar binding site of Ac-AMP2 Although the complex between WGA and N,N '-diacetyl chitobiose has been described (Wright, 1984), the only WGA-carbohydrate complex available from the Brookhaven PDB features the trisaccharide N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose (NeuLac) as ligand (Wright, 1990). Although at first

The backbone of residues Cys12 to Cys31 of hevein and residues Cys55 to Cys74 of WGA are shown superimposed on residues Cys9 to Cys28 of the Ac-AMP2 conformer best fitting on the B-domain of WGA. Notice the absence of the N-terminal loop (in accordance with the four-residue gap in the sequence) and the C-terminal part in Ac-AMP2 when compared with hevein and WGA. b, Ribbon drawing of the backbone atoms of residues Cys12 to Cys31 of hevein (red) and residues Cys55 to Cys74 located in domain B of WGA (blue), superimposed on residues Cys9 to Cys28 of Ac-AMP2 (yellow).

330 domain in the monomer opposite in a secondary role (Wright, 1990). Since hevein and Ac-AMP2 bind to chitin as monomers and other WGA-carbohydrate complexes suggest the primary hevein domain is functional by itself (Wright, 1992) we focus on the B domain of the WGA-NeuLac complex (WGA-B). In this domain, Ser62 and Tyr73 form hydrogen bonds with the terminal non-reducing sugar unit, while Tyr64 and His66 are involved in extensive van der Waals interactions. When their sequence location in WGA-B is compared with that of other hevein domains, it is clearly evident that the seryl residue as well as the occurrence of aromatic functionalities at these positions are conserved. Therefore, one expects that sugar binding to other hevein domains will involve these residues as well. This has been confirmed for hevein (Asensio et al., 1995), and proposed for Ac-AMP2 (Verheyden et al., 1995). Titration of Ac-AMP2 with N,N ',N "-triacetyl chitotriose has shown that residues Phe18, Tyr20 and Tyr27 are involved in sugar binding. These residues fall within the 9-28 segment which adopts a common tertiary fold to WGA and hevein (Figure 7(b)). Therefore, these residues and Ser16 are found in nearly identical positions as in hevein and WGA. Despite some variation in the x2 (x1 for Ser16) dihedral angles for these residues in the set of 26 conformers of Ac-AMP2 (Figure 6), several structures display nearly identical side-chain conformations as in hevein and WGA-B, regardless of the variation in the aromatic moiety type (Figure 7(b)). Therefore, we conclude that the topology of the sugar binding site of Ac-AMP2 is very similar to that of hevein and WGA. The sequence conservation of the aromatic functionalities rather than the nature of the aromatic residues themselves indicates that this topology has to be conserved to make sugar binding possible. Variation in the aromatic residue types then allows a modulation of the sugar binding affinity. The conserved residues remaining throughout the hevein domain sequences are glycyl residues at positions 19 and 22. These may also be interpreted in terms of the preservation of the binding site. Analysis of the Ac-AMP2 structure indicates that the pro-S Ca hydrogen atom is stacked against the ring of Tyr27. This accounts for the strong upfield shift observed for this proton, both in Ac-AMP2 (1.88 ppm) and in hevein (2.1 ppm: Andersen et al., 1993). Substitution of this proton by a larger side-chain may disrupt the binding site through steric conflicts with the aromatic ring. The aL conformation displayed by Gly19 is only easily adopted by glycyl residues. It is involved in a b-bulge at the beginning of the second strand of the sheet. The presence of this bulge shifts the alternating side-chains of this strand out of register by one residue. The absence of this bulge would cause Tyr20 to be located at the opposite side of the sheet, at a rather large distance from the two other aromatic residues. This would imply the van der Waals interaction with the terminal non-reducing sugar unit in WGA-NeuLac to be lost, thus strongly

affecting the binding affinity. Therefore, the occurrence of a conserved glycyl residue at position 19 and the corresponding b-bulge in the structure, may be correlated with the preservation of sugar binding topology of the hevein domain. Upon reduction of the disulfide bridges, the binding of Ac-AMP2 to chitin is abolished (Broekaert et al., 1992), indicating the integrity of the tertiary structure is necessary to keep the sugar binding site intact. To allow disulfide bridge formation the protein has to adopt the correct fold. In this respect, the occurrence of two conserved glycyl residues at positions 19 and 22 could also be necessary to predispose the system to a fold that is subsequently fixed by the formation of the disulfide bridges, as suggested by Andersen et al. (1993).

Material and Methods
Isolation of Ac-AMP2 Ac-AMP2 was isolated from seeds of Amaranthus caudatus L. (Hortiplan) as described in a previous report (Verheyden et al., 1995), except that elution from the chitin affinity column was done with 0.5 M acetic acid instead of 0.5 M KCl. NMR measurements Samples contained 2 mM Ac-AMP2 in either 0.5 ml H2 O/2H2 O (9:1, v/v) or in 2H2 O at pH 2 (pH values were not corrected for the presence of 2H2 O). This low pH was necessary to ensure observation of all amide proton resonances. Samples contained 50 mM NaN3 and were degassed prior to sealing. Unless explicitly mentioned, the spectra were recorded at either 288 K or 303 K on a Bruker AMX500 equipped with a Eurotherm temperature regulator. Sequence-specific assignments were based on various homonuclear 1H 2D spectra recorded both in H2 O/2H2 O (9:1, v/v) and 2H2 O. Typically, 256 FIDs of 2 K data points, 72 scans each were accumulated, using TPPI for phase-sensitive acquisition in t1 (Marion & Wuthrich, ¨ 1983). A spectral width of 6024 Hz and a relaxation delay of one second were used throughout. 2D HOHAHA spectra were recorded with MLEV17 mixing (Bax & Davis, 1985) bracketed between 2.5 ms trim pulses, both using a 10 kHz rf field strength. Mixing times were 20 ms in order to detect direct connectivities and 60 ms to traverse the complete spin systems. A 2QF-COSY (Rance et al., 1983) recorded at pH 2 and 303 K was used to confirm the direct connectivities. The 2D NOESY (Macura & Ernst, 1980) spectra were obtained with a mixing time of 400 ms. The water resonance was saturated by continuous, low field irradiation during the relaxation delay, and for the NOESY spectra, during the mixing time as well. All chemical shifts were referenced to external DSS (2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate). Processing, performed with Bruker's UXNMR software, consisted of zero filling and multiplication by a p/3 shifted sinebell in both time domains, followed by Fourier transformation and fifth order polynomial baseline correction in F2 and F1. The final 2048 × 2048 data matrix yielded a resolution of 2.94 Hz per point. Interproton distances were determined from the buildup of the corresponding NOE cross-peak intensity measured in 2D NOESY spectra recorded at mixing times

calculating their mutual repulsive interaction, allowing all possible disulfide bridge interactions to occur. Prior to the REDAC cycles, additional stereospecific assignments were obtained with a variant (Martins et al., 1995) of a procedure proposed by Widmer et al. (1989). All conformers were scanned for tripeptide segments in which the total contribution to the target function caused ° by violations of the data was smaller than 0.1 A2. For all tripeptide segments in the 1000 conformers that satisfied this criterion, the f, c and x1 dihedral angle values for the central residue were collected and matched with those obtained from HABAS. Whenever the distribution of these angles in the conformers was confined within that for one of the possible assignments in HABAS, it was considered unambiguously assigned. Disulfide bridges were assigned as described by Klaus et al. (1993), using a set of 48 conformers issued from the final REDAC cycle (see Results). In the second and final calculation round the disulfide bridges were enforced with the usual distance restraints (Williamson et al., 1985). Hydrogen bonds were not enforced at any stage in the structure calculation. The energy of a subset of 26 DIANA conformers with lowest target function values was refined with a simulated annealing protocol in the AMBER force field (Weiner et al., 1984) as implemented into DISCOVER 2.9 (Biosym Technologies, USA), further referred to as restrained energy refinement. After initial rEM with 500 steps of steepest descents and 1000 steps of conjugate gradients minimization, rMD was applied during 5 ps at 1000 K, followed by cooling to 300 K in steps of 100 K, with 1 ps simulation time at every temperature. At 300 K an additional 5 ps of rMD was performed, followed by 500 steps of steepest descents and conjugate gradients rEM, until the maximum gradient of the AMBER energy ° was smaller than 0.005 kcal mol-1 A-1. A Lennard-Jones ° potential was used throughout with a 15 A cutoff. No scaling of force field terms was applied during calculations. A distance-dependent dielectric constant (eo = 1) was used. The calculations and analysis of results were performed within INSIGHTII (Insight II User Guide, version 2.3.5. Biosym Technologies, San Diego, 1993) running on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 computer. The coordinates of the 26 refined conformers and the experimental restraints are available from the Brookhaven Protein Databank under accession code 1MMC.

of 50, 100, 150, 175, 200 and 250 ms in both H2 O/2H2 O (9:1, v/v) and 2H2 O. Integration areas were defined at 250 ms with the UXNMR software and subsequently applied to all NOESY spectra. Unknown distances were calibrated by comparing the slope of the corresponding NOE buildups, against the average slope obtained from NOEs corresponding to known distances between bCH2 ° (1.78 A) and the ortho-meta distance of both tyrosine ° residues (2.48 A). Buildup curves were linear up to 250 ms. The spectra in H2 O/2H2 O were used to calculate distances involving amide protons, the other distances were calculated using the spectra in 2H2 O. Upper limits on distances were subsequently obtained by multiplication of the derived distances with 1.1. Sixteen 3JNH-Ha coupling constants were extracted from the 2QF-COSY spectrum using the method described by Kim & Prestegard (1989). An E.COSY (Griesinger et al., 1986, 1987) spectrum was recorded in 2H2 O at 303 K to determine 16 3JHa-Hb coupling constants: 512 FIDs of 4096 data points, 64 scans each were accumulated. The coupling constants were measured from contour plots of the relevant cross-peaks obtained after strip transformation to increase the resolution. To resolve overlap, additional 2D NOESY spectra with mixing times of 200 and 400 ms were recorded at 600 MHz on a Bruker AMX spectrometer on the 2H2 O sample, using States-TPPI (Marion et al., 1989). Fifteen additional non-trivial NOEs derived from these spectra were included for structure calculations by adding an upper limit using a semi-quantitative classification according to their intensities. In preliminary structure calculations conformational heterogeneity was observed for part of the backbone conformation. A 2D NOESY spectrum using the WATERGATE pulse sequence for the suppression of the water resonance (Piotto et al., 1992) was recorded using the recently installed Bruker BGU-Z gradient unit. The 2D NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 200 ms yielded 12 new NOEs involving resonances which were strongly attenuated or absent in previous spectra due to presaturation. The new cross-peaks were integrated and the corresponding new distances were included in the structure calculations. The amide H/2H exchange rates were monitored using a freshly prepared 2H2 O sample. Several 1D spectra were measured at 288 K between two minutes and one week after dissolving the peptide, after one hour a 2D HOHAHA spectrum was recorded in a short time to identify overlapping NH resonances. Determination of the three-dimensional structure HABAS was used to determine initial stereospecific assignments for prochiral b-methylene groups together with allowed ranges for the f, c and x1 dihedral angles (Guntert et al., 1989). All structure calculations were ¨ performed with the program DIANA version 2.1 (Guntert ¨ et al., 1991), as included in NMR TRIAD (Sybyl, Tripos). Pseudo-atoms were defined and corrections to the distances added accordingly, as described by Guntert et al. ¨ (1991). Each structure calculation round started with 1000 conformer calculations. In view of the b-sheet content of Ac-AMP2, these were followed by two REDAC cycles (1000 conformer calculation each) to improve the yield of conformers with low target function value (Guntert & ¨ Wuthrich, 1991). The first round was performed without ¨ enforcing disulfide bonds, using cystinyl residues with deprotonated Sg atoms. In this situation the van der Waals radii for the cystinyl Cb and Sg atoms are reduced when
