ABSTRACT: Monovalent cations activate the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent reactions of tryptophan synthase and affect intersubunit communication in the R2 2 complex. We report refined crystal structures of the tryptophan synthase R2 2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of K+ at 2.0 Å and of Cs+ at 2.3 Å. Comparison of these structures with the recently refined structure in the presence of Na+ shows that each monovalent cation binds at approximately the same position about 8 Å from the phosphate of pyridoxal phosphate. Na+ and K+ are coordinated to the carbonyl oxygens of Phe-306, Ser-308, and Gly-232 and to two or one water molecule, respectively. Cs+ is coordinated to the carbonyl oxygens of Phe-306, Ser-308, Gly-232, Val-231, Gly-268, and Leu-304. A second binding site for Cs+ is located in the / interface on the 2-fold axis with four carbonyl oxygens in the coordination sphere. In addition to local changes in structure close to the cation binding site, a number of long-range changes are observed. The K+ and Cs+ structures differ from the Na+ structure with respect to the positions of Asp305, Lys-167, and RAsp-56. One unexpected result of this investigation is the movement of the side chains of Phe-280 and Tyr-279 from a position partially blocking the tunnel in the Na+ structure to a position lining the surface of the tunnel in the K+ and Cs+ structures. The results provide a structural basis for understanding the effects of cations on activity and intersubunit communication.

There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the effects of monovalent cations on enzyme structure and function as the result of X-ray structures which define the monovalent cation binding sites in four enzymes: dialkylglycine decarboxylase (Hohenester et al., 1994; Toney et al., 1993, 1995), tryptophanase (Isupov et al., 1994), tyrosine phenol-lyase (Antson et al., 1994), and pyruvate kinase (Larsen et al., 1994). Monovalent cation activation of S-adenosylmethionine synthase has been reported (McQueney & Markham, 1995) and is supported by crystallographic data (Takusagawa et al., 1996). These reports provide the first structural basis for understanding the monovalent cation activation or inhibition that has been shown for a large group of enzymes [for a review see Suelter (1970)]. Dialkylglycine decarboxylase, tryptophanase, and tyrosine phenol-lyase all utilize the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)1 and belong to a large family of PLP-dependent enzymes, termed the R family (Alexander et al., 1994) or Fold type I (Grishin et al., 1995). [See Woehl and Dunn (1995b) for a recent review of the roles of Na+ and K+ in PLP enzyme catalysis.]

The subunit of tryptophan synthase belongs to the second family of PLP enzymes, termed the family (Alexander et al., 1994) or Fold type II (Grishin et al., 1995). Monovalent cation activation has been reported for the tryptophan synthase subunit (Crawford & Ito, 1964; Goldberg et al., 1968; Hatanaka et al., 1962; Miles & McPhie, 1974; Ruvinov et al., 1995a; York, 1972) and for the tryptophan synthase R2 2 complex (Dunn et al., 1994; Peracchi et al., 1994, 1995; Ruvinov et al., 1995a; Schwartz & Bonner, 1964; Woehl & Dunn, 1995a; Woehl & Dunn, 1995b). The tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20) R2 2 complex catalyzes the last two reactions in the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan [for reviews see Miles (1979, 1991, 1995), Miles et al. (1994), Swift and Stewart (1991), and Yanofsky and Crawford (1972)]. Early studies (Creighton, 1970; DeMoss, 1962; Matchett, 1974; Yanofsky & Rachmeler, 1958) and recent kinetic investigations (Anderson et al., 1991; Brzovic et al., 1992a; Dunn et al., 1990; Lane & ´ Kirschner, 1991) provide evidence that indole is a "channeled" intermediate in the overall R reaction.

4212 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 13, 1996 R and subunits are about 25 Å apart and are connected by a hydrophobic tunnel. This tunnel provides a plausible structural route for transfer of indole produced at the active site of the R subunit to the active site of the subunit. Alterations in the geometry of the indole tunnel may be important in controlling passage of indole and in communication between the R and subunits. Many studies have demonstrated ligand-dependent reciprocal communication between the R and subunits and have provided evidence for the interconversion of the R and subunits between "open" and "closed" conformations (Ahmed et al., 1991; Anderson et al., 1991; Brzovic et al., 1991, 1992a,b, ´ 1993; Dunn et al., 1991, 1994; Houben & Dunn, 1990; Kawasaki et al., 1987; Kirschner et al., 1991; Lane & Kirschner, 1981, 1983, 1991; Ruvinov et al., 1995b; Yang & Miles, 1993). Recent investigations in this laboratory have identified a Na+ binding site in the three-dimensional structure of the wild-type tryptophan synthase R2 2 complex2 and in a mutant ( K87T) R2 2 complex.3 We now report crystal structures of tryptophan synthase with bound K+ and with bound Cs+ at a resolution of 2.0 and 2.3 Å, respectively, and compare these structures with that of the Na+ complex.2 We find that exchange of K+ or Cs+ for Na+ produces local changes near the cation site, affects the interaction site between the R and subunits, and alters the conformation of the indole tunnel. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization, Soaking, and Data Collection. The tryptophan synthase R2 2 complex from S. typhimurium was crystallized in a solution containing 50 mM Bicine, 1 mM Na-EDTA, 0.8-1.5 mM spermine, and 12% PEG 8000 adjusted to pH 7.8 with NaOH (Ahmed et al., 1985). Monoclinic crystals grown in the presence of Na+ ion (typically 0.7 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm) belong to a space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a ) 184.5 Å, b ) 61.1 Å, c ) 67.7 Å, and ) 94.7°. A crystal grown in the presence of Na+ was first washed several times in a small volume (100 µL) of the K+ or Cs+ soaking solution (below) and then transferred to a larger volume (1 mL) of the soaking solution for 1-3 days. The soaking solution for K+ containing 100 mM Bicine, 1 mM EDTA (free acid form), and 15% PEG 8000 was adjusted with KOH to pH 7.8 to give a final concentration of 37 mM K+. The soaking solution for Cs+ containing 50 mM Bis-Tris propane, 1 mM EDTA (free acid form), 100 mM CsCl, and 15% PEG 8000 was adjusted with HCl to pH 7.8. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Raxis IIc imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. The crystal to detector distance was 100-120 mm and exposures were 20-25 min per 1.2° oscillation. All diffraction data were integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). Table 1 summarizes statistics of the collected data sets. Structure Determination.

using phases from the structure of tryptophan synthase,2 which has been refined to a resolution of 1.9 Å in the presence of Na+ (concentration of Na+ is approximately 17 mM). These difference maps were noisy and had many positive and negative difference peaks all over the structure, suggesting that there were structural perturbations in tryptophan synthase as a result of replacing Na+ with K+ or Cs+. The 1.9 Å resolution Na+ complex was used as a starting model for further refinement using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) ¨ against the 2.0 Å data set for the K+-bound enzyme: coordinates for Na+ and water molecules were not included in the starting model. Since structural perturbations were observed in the K+-bound enzyme, a starting model was first subjected to rigid-body refinement. Three substructures were allowed to move independently in a rigid-body motion relative to each other, the whole R subunit (residue numbers 1-268), and the N- and C-terminal domains of the subunit (residue numbers 3-204 and 205-391, respectively). A simulated annealing (at initial temperature 3000 K) followed by energy minimization and isotropic temperature factor refinement resulted in the model with a crystallographic R-value of 0.221 and an Rfree of 0.290. This refined structure was manually rebuilt using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). At this point, the side chains of Tyr-279 and Phe280 in the subunit of the refined model were clearly out of density in a 2Fo - Fc Fourier map, and both side chains were repositioned to fit the map (Figure 1). A simulatedannealing map with these residues omitted also indicated that current conformations of Tyr-279 and Phe-280 are unbiased models. However, due to steric hindrance, fitting the

Tryptophan Synthase: Effect of Monovalent Cations side chain conformation of Tyr-279 into a map also required repositioning of the side chain of Asp-56 in the R subunit, although this side chain is very mobile and has very weak electron density. After the model was rebuilt, water molecules were assigned in a Fo - Fc Fourier map to the strong positive difference peaks with density >3, where  is the rms deviation in a Fo - Fc Fourier map. At this stage, it was noted that the strongest positive difference peak in a Fo - Fc Fourier map (more than 6) was at almost the same position as the Na+ binding site. Instead of assigning the K+ ion site, we left this peak as a water molecule and carried out further refinement. Another round of a simulated annealing (at initial temperature 500 K) and energy minimization gave more solid evidence that this strong peak corresponds to a K+ binding site, because the refined B-factor (about 10 Å2) for this peak is much lower than those (about 26 Å2) of neighboring atoms within 3.0 Å. The K+ ion was then included in the model, and in order to estimate accurate distances between K+ ion and ligand atoms, another round of simulated annealing (at initial temperature 500 K) and energy minimization was performed with metal-ligand distances unrestrained. The difference map between the data sets of the Cs+ and + crystals with phases calculated from the refined K+ K complex described above was much clearer. It shows two very strong positive peaks (>9) for Cs+ ions: one corresponds to the position of K+ in the refined K+ complex and the other is positioned at the - subunit interface that is generated by crystallographic symmetry. The 2.0 Å resolution K+ complex, excluding K+ and water molecules, was used as a starting model for further refinement against the 2.3 Å data set of the Cs+-bound enzyme. The same strategy to refine the K+ complex as described above was also applied to determine the Cs+ complex and the distances between Cs+ and its ligand atoms. Table 1 contains information about the refinement and the quality of the refined final model. Structure Comparisons. The noisy difference maps between the Na+ complex and the K+ or Cs+ complex suggested that structural changes accompany the replacement of Na+ by K+ or Cs+. We therefore compared the three structures as described below and tried to identify any cationinduced structural changes. When superpositions were carried out using the main chain atoms between the corresponding subunit of the K+ or Cs+ complex and the Na+ complex, no significant changes were observed in the subunit (rotation angle of 0.1°). However, relatively larger movements were noticed in the R subunit (rotation angle of 1.0°). In order to detect small structural changes in the subunit, a superposition method developed by Lesk (1991) and Gerstein and Chothia (1991) was used, where iterative superpositions yield a stationary part of the molecule having small rms deviations. This nonmoving part serves as a core for further superpositions. The structural changes in each residue were judged by calculating the rms deviations of the main chain atoms after a superposition. Since the Luzzati plot indicated a coordinate error about 0.30, 0.30, and 0.35 Å for the Na+, K+, and Cs+ complexes, respectively, only those residues with less than 0.4 Å of rms deviation in their main chain atoms were included as core residues for superpositions. The resulting core contained 1360 out of 1556 starting main chain atoms for superposition of the subunit of the Na+ and K+ complexes and 1308 main chain atoms between the subunits of the Na+ and Cs+ complexes.

MonoValent Cation Binding Sites. Cs+ and K+ bind to a site in the C-terminal domain of the subunit (site 1; Figure 2b,c, and Table 2) which had been previously identified as the binding site for Na+ (Figure 2a,e) in the wild-type R2 2 complex2 and in the K87T R2 2 complex.3 Each site is in approximately the same place and involves mostly the same ligands although the actual site positions differ by 0.5 and 1.1 Å for K+ and Cs+, respectively. Each cation is stabilized by interaction with the carbonyl oxygens of three to six enzyme residues and with zero to two water molecules (Table 2). The interacting enzyme residues are located in a long loop (residues 259-310) that connects strand 8 and helix 10 and in a short loop (residues 231-234) between strand 7 and helix 9 (Hyde et al., 1988) (Figure 3). One of these interacting residues, Gly-232, also forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group of the coenzyme PLP. The cation binding site is about 8 Å distant from the phosphate of PLP. The K+ binding site (Figure 2b,f, and Table 2) has a geometry which is very similar to that of the Na+ binding site, except that only one well-defined water molecule (Bfactor with 15 Å2) is in the coordination shell instead of two water molecules (B-factor with 22 Å2) found in the Na+ binding site. The main chain carbonyl oxygens of Gly232, Phe-306, and Ser-308 and one water molecule form the coordination shell of K+. The Cs+ binding site (Figure 2c,g, and Table 2) forms an octahedral coordination shell and has interactions with the main chain carbonyl oxygens of Gly-232, Phe-306, Ser308, Val-231, Gly-268, and Leu-304 and with no water molecules. The carbonyl oxygen of Leu-304 forms a longer interaction (4.0 Å) with Cs+ than any of the other interactions which range from 2.9 to 3.4 Å. The average distance between the center of cation density and ligand atoms is 2.23 Å in the Na+ complex, 2.66 Å in the K+ complex, and 3.4 Å in the Cs+ complex. These values agree well with the minimum metal-oxygen distances measured in crystal structures of small molecules: 2.25 Å for Na+ and 2.46 Å for K+ (Glusker, 1991). We observe a second binding site for Cs+ (site 2) which is located on the molecular 2-fold axis, within the interface, and is probably the result of the larger ionic radius of Cs+ (1.69 Å) compared with Na+ (0.95 Å) and K+ (1.33 Å). A total of four carbonyl oxygens, two from Gly-54 and Pro-56 and two from their symmetry-related equivalents on the other subunit, assume an approximately tetrahedral geometry with an average O-Cs distance of 3.42 Å (Figure 2d,h). Structural Changes in the R Subunit. The substitution of K+ for Na+ resulted in a small rotation (1°) of the R subunit relative to the subunit. In order to ensure that this small change was not due to a misinterpretation of the data, the coordinates of the fully refined K+ complex were refined against the diffraction data of the Na+ complex using X-PLOR. This "back"-refined Na+ complex was indistinguishable from the original 1.9 Å resolution Na+ complex, indicating that the small movement of the R subunit in both the K+ and Cs+ complexes is reproducible and meaningful. A structural comparison indicates that the R subunit active site loop containing Asp-60 was displaced more (greater than 1.0 Å rms displacement for the main chain atoms) than the rest of the R subunit (Figure 4A). In addition, a comparison of the refined B-factors between the K+ or Cs+ complex and

FIGURE 3: Regions in the subunit (residues 231-233 and residues 259-310) that contain residues that bind Na+, K+, or Cs+ (M) or Cs+ alone (m) are susceptible to limited proteolysis (P), interact with the R subunit (R), or line the channel wall (C). The assignment of R and C is taken from Figure 3 in Zhao and Somerville (1992) and C. Hyde (personal communication).

the Na+ complex (Figure 5) shows that residues Ser-55 to Gln-80 in the R subunit, which include the active site loop-2 and many of the R- interface residues, are significantly more flexible in the K+ and Cs+ complexes, whereas the B-factors for the subunit residues do not change significantly. Consequently, there is no electron density for the side chain of RAsp-56 in the K+ and Cs+ complexes (see next section for details). These differences in B-factors might have resulted from the different resolutions of the complexes (1.9, 2.0, and 2.3 Å for the Na+, K+, and Cs+ complex, respectively), but the almost identical B-factors between the K+ and Cs+ complexes suggest that they represent intrinsic properties of the enzyme with different cations. Structural Changes in the Subunit. Replacement of Na+ with K+ or Cs+ slightly displaces the cation binding loop residues in order to accommodate binding of the larger cations. Table 3 shows the changes in position of the liganding residues and their neighbors; the largest movements occur for Phe-306 and Asp-305. Asp-305, a residue that does not interact directly with the cation, exhibits positional shifts for the main chain atoms similar to those of Phe-306 (0.40 Å in the K+ complex

and 0.75 Å in the Cs+ complex). In the crystal structure of the Na+ complex, two distinct side chain conformations of Asp-305 have been modeled to fit the electron density.2 In one conformation, termed the "swing-in position", the carboxylate of Asp-305 is oriented toward the active site of the subunit, whereas in the other conformation, the "swing-out position", the carboxylate is oriented away from the active site. The negative charge of Asp-305 in the swing-in position is neutralized by an ionic interaction with the -amino group of Lys-167, which is 2.8 Å away (Figures 6a and 7a). In the swing-out orientation Asp-305 can no longer interact with Lys-167 (the distance between the opposing charged atoms is more than 7 Å) but instead makes hydrogen bonds to other groups. In the crystals of the Na+ complex the swing-in position is favored, although the electron density is indicative of some disorder. In the K+ and Cs+ complexes (Figures 6b and 7b) the structures differ from that observed for the Na+ complex. First, the side chain of Asp-305 becomes even more disordered, and although there is some very weak electron density corresponding to the swing-out position, neither position can be directly modeled from the density. Second, the side chain of the R- interface residue, Lys-167, now occupies a different position. There is clear electron density in both the K+ and Cs+ crystals for the side chain of Lys167 that now points in the direction of an R subunit residue, probably to the side chain carboxylic group of RAsp-56, a nearby negatively charged residue. Although electron den-

This is the first monovalent cation site to be determined for a PLP-dependent enzyme in the family (Alexander et al., 1994) or Fold type II (Grishin et al., 1995). Since the tryptophan synthase subunit is the only member of this family that has been solved crystallographically (PDB entry 1WSY), the subunit and its monovalent cation site serve as prototypes for other members of this family (cysteine synthase, cystathionine synthase, L-serine and D-serine dehydratases, threonine dehydratase, threonine synthase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, and alliin lyase) that exhibit similarities in sequence, secondary structure, hydrophobicity profiles, and reaction specificity (Alexander et al., 1994; Grishin et al., 1995) although the binding specificities of these enzymes for monovalent cations are not known. However, it has been shown that K+ ions can specifically lower the apparent Kd value of L-serine dehydratase (Pestana, 1971) and of D-serine ~ dehydratase (Federiuk & Shafer, 1981) for pyridoxal phosphate. Studies of the effects of K+ and of Na+ on the 31P NMR spectrum of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor of D-serine dehydratase have suggested that these two cations stabilize conformational states that differ with respect to O-P-O bond angle, conformation, and/or hydrogen bonding of the phosphate group of the enzyme-bound cofactor (Kojiro et al., 1989). Thus, other members of the family may also have cation binding sites. Cation Binding Site. Na+, K+, and Cs+ bind to a site in the subunit (site 1) about 8 Å from the phosphate of PLP and too distant from the active site to play a direct role in catalysis. The cation site involves residues from two different regions of the same subunit (Figures 2 and 3). One of the regions ( subunit residues 259-310) folds in a complicated way and lacks well-defined secondary structural elements (Hyde et al., 1988). Residues in this region make several contacts with the R subunit and contribute to the wall that lines the indole tunnel. This region has been termed a "hinge region" since it contains five sites that in the separate subunit are susceptible to proteolysis by trypsin (Lys-272, Arg-275, and Lys-283) (Ahmed et al., 1986; Hogberg¨ Raibaud & Goldberg, 1977) or by endopeptidase Glu-C (Glu290 and Glu-296) (Friguet et al., 1989; Kaufmann et al., 1991; Linkens et al., 1993, 1994). We speculate that the bound cation may stabilize the structure of the subunit by bridging these two regions of the molecule. Comparison with Other PLP Enzymes. The monovalent cation binding sites in three members of the R family of PLP enzymes [dialkylglycine decarboxylase (Hohenester et al., 1994; Toney et al., 1993, 1995), tryptophanase (Isupov et al., 1994), and tyrosine phenol-lyase (Antson et al., 1994)] are also distinctly separate from the active site but occur in different protein folds and have different ligands in the coordination spheres. The cation site in these enzymes occurs in the interaction site between two different subunits and may be important for subunit interaction and for PLP binding at the subunit interface. MonoValent Cation SelectiVity. Peracchi et al. have reported that the tryptophan synthase R2 2 complex exhibits low selectivity for cations and suggest that this low selectivity may be a consequence of the coordination with the oxygen of carbonyl groups and waters reported herein (Peracchi et al., 1995). The authors quote Eisenman as suggesting that cation binding sites containing water are not very selective and that sites with few dipole interactions between the cation and the protein might allow ions of different size to bind

sity for the side chain of RAsp-56 in these crystals is absent, in other structures such as the K87T mutant with bound ligand there is clear observation of this ionic interaction with similar density for Lys-167 and clear density for the side chain of RAsp-56.3 Unlike the small and disordered structural perturbations of some of the residues described above, the displacement of the side chains of Tyr-279 and Phe-280 was large and unambiguous in the presence of K+ and Cs+. Those movements are accompanied by changes in the side chain dihedral angle ( 1) by 70° for Tyr-279 and 100° for Phe280 (Figures 6 and 7). The movements of the side chains of Tyr-279 and Phe-280 in the presence of K+ and Cs+ require the concurrent movement of RAsp-56 side chain (Figures 6 and 7). DISCUSSION In the present paper and elsewhere2,3 we have demonstrated that K+, Cs+, and Na+ bind at the same general position

Color codes are as follows: red for R subunit residues 55-60; green for the side chain of RD56; blue for subunit residues 87-88, 108-116, 167-171, 279-280, and 304308; magenta for the side chains of subunit residues K167, Y279, F280, and D305; black for pyridoxal phosphate (internal aldimine) and bound cation. Note that the side chain of D305 is modeled as two alternative conformations in (a).

without large conformational changes (Eisenman & Dani, 1987). In contrast, dialkylglycine decarboxylase (Hohenester et al., 1994; Toney et al., 1993, 1995), tryptophanase (Isupov et al., 1994), and tyrosine phenol-lyase (Antson et al., 1994) exhibit more selective cation binding than tryptophan synthase. For example, dialkylglycine decarboxylase requires a monovalent cation with an ionic radius of 1.3-1.5 Å (K+, Rb+, or NH4+) for full catalytic activity (Hohenester et al., 1994). Only weak activation is observed with the smaller Na+ and the larger Cs+. The cation binding sites in these enzymes are formed by more strongly interacting residues including the carboxylate of an Asp or Glu and one serine hydroxyl (Woehl & Dunn, 1995b). Structural Changes at the Cation Binding Site. Exchange of K+ or Cs+ for Na+ results in some displacement of the contacting side chains from the cation site in order to accommodate the larger cation. Accompanying these movements is a significant increase in the disorder of the side chain of Asp-305 and a displacement of Lys-167. The side chain of Lys-167 is well-defined and now appears to point in the direction of RAsp-56; because RAsp-56 is disordered, the details of the interaction cannot be deter-

mined. However, it is interesting to note the striking change in the position of Lys-167 in which the lysine side chain swings from pointing in the general direction of the subunit active site to a position in which it points toward the Rinterface (Figures 6 and 7 and Table 2). Mutagenesis studies indicate that RAsp-56 (Lim et al., 1991) and Lys-167 (Yang & Miles, 1993) play roles in intersubunit communication. The mutant D56G shows normal R subunit activity but very low activity in the and the R reactions. The mutant K167T shows a 25-fold reduction in the rate of the reaction which can be restored by the presence of R subunit ligands and also notably by high concentrations of potassium phosphate, possibly by stabilizing a more active conformation of the mutant subunit. The studies of the wild-type enzyme reported here showing structural changes in residues RAsp-56, Lys-167, and Asp305 produced by monovalent cations provide a partial basis for understanding the effects of cations on the activity of PLP-dependent reactions of tryptophan synthase and on intersubunit communication (Crawford & Ito, 1964; Dunn et al., 1994; Goldberg et al., 1968; Hatanaka et al., 1962;

Tryptophan Synthase: Effect of Monovalent Cations

Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 13, 1996 4219

FIGURE 7: 2Fo - Fc maps of (a) the Na+ complex and (b) the K+ complex, illustrating the major changes in density corresponding to movements in position of RAsp-56, Lys-167, Tyr-279, Phe-280, and Asp-305. The models correspond to our interpretations of the side chain movements of these residues. The carboxy oxygens in the side chain of RAsp-56 and Asp-305 are represented with filled small circles. Note that we cannot be certain of the position of RAsp-56 in the K+ complex because the density is extremely weak. The side chain of Asp-305 is modeled as two alternative conformations in (a).

Peracchi et al., 1994, 1995; Ruvinov et al., 1995a; Schwartz & Bonner, 1964; Woehl & Dunn, 1995a,b; York, 1972). On the whole we see only small changes in the active site. However, we do observe changes in the density of Asp305, a residue which interacts with the hydroxyl of serine in the external aldimine of the K87T mutant structure.3 Effects of MonoValent Cations on the Indole Tunnel. In the course of the 1.9 Å refinement of the crystal structure of the R2 2 complex in the presence of Na+, it has been noticed that the side chains of Phe-280 and RLeu-58 are located within the tunnel that connects the R and sites.2 These side chains have low electron density and high B-factors, suggesting either that they are mobile or that there may be static disorder involving two or more positions. In the refined K+ and Cs+ structures, the side chain of Phe-280 moves out of the tunnel and is clearly located within the surface of the tunnel where it replaces the side chain of Tyr279 which in turn moves toward the R subunit and interacts with part of the flexible loop-2 residues (54-61) of the R subunit (Figures 6b and 7b). Our results lead us to speculate that the following chain of events accompanies the exchange of K+ or Cs+ for Na+. Binding of the larger cation near the side chain of Asp305 will perturb the interaction between the side chains of Asp-305 and Lys-167 which in turn allows Lys-167 to

interact with Asp-56 in the R subunit loop-2. This interaction may then allow the side chains of Tyr-279 and Phe-280 to orient toward the R subunit and out of the tunnel. The interaction with RAsp-56 in the K+ and Cs+ structures could cause the observed structural perturbations of the flexible active site loop-2 in the R subunit and the small rotation of the R subunit relative to the subunit. Comparison of Crystallographic and Solution Studies. Solution studies of the tryptophan synthase R2 2 complex have determined the effects of different monovalent cations on the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates, on the rates of individual steps in the reaction of L-serine, and on steady-state kinetic constants (Peracchi et al., 1995; Ruvinov et al., 1995a; Woehl & Dunn, 1995a,b). Because the binding of Na+ gives significantly more of the external aldimine of L-serine and less of the external aldimine of aminoacrylate than does K+, Na+ appears to be more effective than K+ in stabilizing the conformation of the L-serine intermediate (Peracchi et al., 1995; Woehl & Dunn, 1995a,b). Our crystallographic results show that Na+ and K+ stabilize different conformational states of the internal aldimine and are thus consistent with the solution studies which show that Na+ and K+ stabilize different conformational states of the external aldimines. Microspectrophotometric studies of single crystals of the R2 2 complex in the

4220 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 13, 1996 presence of L-serine show that monovalent cations also affect the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates in the crystalline state (Peracchi et al., 1995). Thus studies of the enzyme in both crystalline state and in solution indicate that cations play a structural role, stabilizing alternative enzyme conformations and enzyme-substrate intermediates. Early studies showed that some monovalent cations (K+, +, and NH +, but not Na+) activate the Li 4 2 subunit (Crawford & Ito, 1964; Hatanaka et al., 1962). Studies of the effects of Cs+ on the 2 subunit and a mutant R2 2 complex ( E109A) also support the hypothesis that Cs+ stabilizes an alternative conformation of the 2 subunit and the mutant R2 2 complex which is more similar to that of the wild-type R2 2 complex (Ruvinov et al., 1995a). The crystallographic results which show that Na+ and K+ affect residues in the interaction site between the R and subunits also support the solution studies which suggest that monovalent cations play a role in allosteric linkage between the R and subunits (Woehl & Dunn, 1995a,b). CONCLUSION The results presented here complement the spectroscopic and kinetic data of Peracchi et al. (1995) and Woehl and Dunn (1995a) and provide a structural basis for understanding the role of cations in regulating the activity and intersite communication of tryptophan synthase. A surprising result from this investigation is the opening of the tunnel connecting the R and active sites by the movement of Phe-280 out of the tunnel in the presence of K+ and Cs+. Although we cannot directly use this effect to explain the spectroscopic results, they provide a basis for the design of further experiments to relate the effect of cations with the other allosteric properties of this bifunctional enzyme system.
