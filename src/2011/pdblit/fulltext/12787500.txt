Bacterial infectivity often relies on efficient attachment to the host cells through adhesive extensions. Unveiling the structural basis of the formation of these organelles is of paramount importance for both academic and applicative implications. Computational approaches may fruitfully complement experimental studies by providing information on specific conformational states whose characterization is difficult. Here, we report molecular dynamics characterizations of Yersinia pestis Caf1 subunit in its monomeric-unbound and dimeric states. Data on the monomeric form indicate that it is highly reactive and evolves toward compact states, which likely hamper subunit­subunit association. In line with recent experimental reports, this finding implies that chaperone release and subunit­subunit association must be simultaneous. MD analysis on Caf1 dimer lead to the formation of a novel assembly endowed with a significant stability in the simulation timescale. Using these data, an end-to-end model of the fiber, which well agrees with available experimental data, was also generated. Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Bacterial infectivity often relies on efficient attachment to the host cells. To this scope, bacteria have developed a variety of different adhesive extensions. The chaperone/usher secretion system represents the prominent machinery devoted to the production of these organelles [1,2]. Based on their structure and morphology, two distinct families have been identified. One includes either thick rigid or thin flexible adhesive pili made of pilin or fimbrin subunit, while the other contains non-pilus organelles with an amorphous or capsule-like morphology [3,4]. The assembly of adhesive pili and non-pilus extensions is assisted by FGS and FGL chaperones, respectively [5,6]. Although these chaperones share a common Ig-like fold, they are characterized by a different length of the loop connecting the F1 and G1 strand, which is longer in the FGL family [7]. Very recently, a different classification of these organelles, based on the adhesive properties of the structural subunit has been proposed [7]. In this framework, FGL chaperone-assisted adhesive extensions and the majority of FGS chaperone assembled adhesive pili are fimbrial polyadhesins and monoadhesins, respectively [7]. Structural investigations have provided enlightening information on the mechanisms of monoadhesins and fimbrial polyadhesins [2,5­15]. These studies have also highlighted analogies and differences between these two classes [7,8]. In both cases, their constituting subunits exhibit a non-canonical incomplete immu* Corresponding author. Fax: +39 08 12536642. E-mail address: rita.berisio@unina.it (R.

no-globulin-like (Ig-like) fold with an N-terminal region which does not interact with the rest of the protein. The association of the subunits is based on the binding of the N-terminus of one subunit to the main body of the adjacent one via a donorstrand complementation mechanism. Chaperones (FGS and FGL) assist the folding of the subunits and are vital for their correct assembly in the final organelles. However, in this common scenario, significant differences between the two classes are detected in the subunit/chaperone association. In particular, fimbrial polyadhesins/FGL complexes present an enhanced surface interaction, compared to monoadhesins/FGS ones. Although these crystallographic studies have provided a solid base for the understanding of these processes at molecular level, some important aspects, essentially related with the structure and the role of transient species, are yet to be clarified. Recent investigations have shown that molecular dynamics simulations are valuable in providing atomic level details of these complex processes, whose inhibition strongly depotentiate these pathogens [13,16,17]. Here we applied this approach to the Caf1 subunit, which represents the basic element of the capsulae formed by Yersinia pestis, the pathogen responsible for human bubonic and pneumonic plague. We focused our attention on two states of the protein whose structure has not been characterized experimentally. In particular, our simulations provide insights into the structural features of the incomplete Ig-like Caf1 domain in its unbound state and into the subunit/subunit association process that leads to the formation of capsulae.

Materials and methods Starting models. The starting coordinates of Caf1 subunit were derived from the complex between the chaperone Caf1M and two Caf1 subunits (Caf1M­Caf10 ­Caf100 ) [5,13]. In the complex the Caf10 subunit is bound the chaperone Caf1M, while Caf100 binds the N-terminal extension donated by Caf10 . The highest resolution structure of the complex (1.99 Å), corresponding to the mutant Ala9Arg was used to build the models used in the simulations (PDB code 1P5U). To simulate the conformational transition occurring upon chaperone release, the main body of the chaperonebound Caf1' subunit (residues 16­149) was used as starting model in the analysis of the unbound Caf1 subunit dynamics. The starting arrangement of Caf1 dimer was based on the Caf10 ­Caf100 organization observed in the ternary Caf1M­Caf10 ­Caf00 complex. Also, to simulate the final fiber, which is made of Caf1 subunits resembling Caf00 , the model of Caf10 was replaced by Caf100 . Model building was used to reconstruct the missing regions, typically loops, of the starting structure. To reproduce the sequence of the wild-type form, an Ala residue was built in position 9. Simulation procedure. MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS software package 3.3 [18] and following the procedures used in previous studies [16,19,20]. In all MD simulations the model was immersed in a rectangular box filled with water molecules. The dimensions of the box were 7.54 Â 5.23 Â 4.93 nm3 (number of water molecules 5538) and 11.20 Â 8.07 Â 6.25 nm3 (number of water molecules 17,257) for the runs carried on the monomeric and dimeric forms of Caf1, respectively (see above). The GROMOS43a1 force field and the SPCE water model were used in the simulations. The simulations were run with periodic boundary conditions. Systems were simulated in NPT ensemble by keeping constant temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 atm). Before starting the MD simulation, energies were minimized by fixing the protein atoms and then without restraints. The system temperature was brought to 300 K in a step-wise manner. In particular, 20 ps MD runs were carried out at 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 K. For each model, MD simulations were carried out in a time scale of 30,000 ps. Bond lengths were constrained by the LINCS procedure. Lennard­Jones interactions were calculated with a 12 Å twin-range cutoff. A dielectric constant of 1 and a time step of 2fs were used. Electrostatic interactions were treated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method with a cutoff of 10.0 Å. Trajectories were checked to assess the quality of the simulation using GROMACS routines and the program VMD [21]. We checked that in all simulations the lowest distance between protein images was always larger than non-bonded and electrostatic cut-off values (12 Å). Results and discussion Dynamics of the unliganded Caf1 reveals a new accessible conformational state for this subunit The investigation of the intrinsic conformational behavior of the Ig-like Caf1 domain (residues 16­149) in its unbound state was conducted by MD simulations using the structure of the Caf10 subunit, derived from the ternary complex Caf1M­Caf10 ­Caf100 , as a starting model [5](Fig. S1). The analysis of the system evolution throughout the MD simulation, carried out using several indicators, clearly show that Caf1 undergoes a rapid transition within the first ns (Fig. S2A). RMSD deviations from the starting X-ray model indicate that an early event (<1000 ps) is followed by a second smoother transition occurring at 7000­8000 ps, which leads to a state that is stable over the last 20,000 ps of the trajectory. The rather large deviations of the trajectory structures from the starting X-ray model ($3.3 Å) are indicative of significant variations

occurring during the simulation. The overall transformation of the system is associated with a significant decrease of the total accessible surface area (Fig. S2B). Analysis of the trajectory structures suggests that the largest modifications affect the regions on the protein surface (strands A and F) that were initially involved in the complex with Caf1M and line an empty groove in the starting X-ray model. The system reacts to the chaperone dissociation by reducing the extent of the exposed surface. In particular, residues of the strands A and F come closer during the simulation. To quantify these effects we evaluated the evolution, throughout the simulation, of distances between Ca atoms of residues facing each other in the groove (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1, a significant decrease is observed for all distances taken into account. However, the entity of the movements is diversified along the groove. In particular, the distance between residues involved in the P1 site (19­ 22 and 143­145) evolves to values similar to those detected in the ``closed" Caf1'' state of the ternary complex Caf1M­Caf10 ­Caf100 [5]. A similar trend is observed in an alternative 30,000 ps MD run carried out starting the simulation directly at 300 K without the stepwise temperature increase pre-equilibration procedure (Fig. S3). This finding is in agreement with a previous short (<1 ns) MD simulation on the same system [13] and supports the hypothesis that this spontaneous transformation of the subunit upon chaperone dissociation provides the energy required for the fiber formation process [5,13]. However, our simulations show that other regions of the groove, specifically those corresponding to the site P5 (residues 26­29 and residues 136­138), exhibit a more complicated dynamic behavior. Indeed, the initial closure of the structure observed in the first 4000­7000 is followed by a second transition. As a consequence, in the plateau region of the trajectory (10,000­30,000), the approaching of facing residues of the groove goes beyond that observed in the ``closed" Caf100 form (Fig. 1 and 2) and leads to the formation of H-bonds between residues of the strands A and F (Fig. 1E and F). The analysis of the distances between atoms involved in these H-bonds interactions clearly indicates that, once formed, these interactions are fairly stable. Notably, the P5 site is the recognition region that initiates the donor-strand exchange in the subunit­subunit association that leads to the formation of the capsulae. Therefore, the spontaneous closure of this site upon chaperone dissociation makes the subunit­ subunit association process more problematic. There are several indications that in chaperone/usher secretion systems the chaperone release and donor-strand complementation between subunits are concerted processes [6,22]. It has also been shown that not only are chaperones important for subunit folding but they also favor the fiber formation [6]. In this framework, present data provide a rationale to these observations. Indeed, chaperones are important for preventing a collapse of the subunit that would obstruct the groove at the P5 side and, therefore, hamper strand exchange and subunit­subunit association. Since analogue effects are observed in chaperone (FGS family) release by pilins [16], these findings suggest that unliganded monoadhesins and fimbrial polyadhesins share a similar tendency to collapse despite a rather different interaction with their chaperones. This quick and spontaneous structural transition can be considered as a manifestation of the high reactivity of these chains. Their tendency to bury residues that are exposed in their unbound state may be an important factor that favors the polymerization process. Dynamics of the Caf1 dimer provides insight into subunit­subunit association within the fiber The simultaneous presence in the ternary complex Caf1M­ Caf10 ­Caf100 of two Caf1 chains provides the opportunity to evaluate preferred association modes of these subunits that may be relevant for the fiber formation process. However, in the crystal

In particular, Ca­Ca distances at the P1 site (21­143 and 22­142) are reported in panels A and B whereas Ca­Ca distances at the P5 site (28­137, and 29­136) are reported in panels C and D.

structure, due to the presence of the Caf1M chaperone, very limited interactions between Caf10 and Caf100 have been detected [5]. Indeed, apart from the interactions of Caf100 with the donated strand of Caf10 , inter-subunit direct hydrogen bonds exist only between Arg18 side chain and the backbone oxygen of Ile31 and between the side chain atom OE1 of Glu15 and the side chain NZ of Lys52 [5]. Nevertheless, on the basis of this structure a model for the fiber

has been proposed by assuming that the relative orientation of Caf10 ­Caf100 observed in the complex was present in the entire fiber [5]. In order to verify the ability of these interactions to keep the crystallographic Caf1 dimer in a stable state independently of the presence of the chaperone, we carried a MD analysis on the isolated dimer. Since in Caf1M­Caf10 ­Caf100 only Caf100 has a fibril-like structure whereas Caf10 is bound to Caf1M, coordinates of Caf10

were replaced with those of Caf100 in the starting model to emulate subunit­subunit interactions in the final fiber (see materials and methods for further details). The analysis of the RMSD values between the trajectory structures of Caf1 dimer and the starting model suggests that a large structural re-organization of the Caf1 dimer occurs (Fig. S4A). Indeed, RMSD deviations rapidly increase to values as high as 8 Å in the early stage of the simulation (<1000 ps). A further increase of the RMSD values up to 13 Å is observed within the first 10,000 ps of the simulation. As shown in Fig. S4A, the trend of the RMSD values indicate that, after this major re-organization, the system reaches a rather stable state in the 10,000­30,000 ps interval of the trajectory. On the other hand, RMSD deviations exhibited by the individual subunits are very low (below 2 Å). Altogether these findings suggest that the variations detected during the simulation may be ascribed to changes of the relative orientation of the two subunits, whose structures are well preserved. The analysis of the gyration radius (Fig. S4B) shows that the structure of Caf1 dimer becomes more compact during the simulation. The transition of the simulation is also associated with a reduction of the surface accessible area (Fig. S4C). These observations strongly indicate that the starting configuration of the dimer is highly unstable and evolves toward a new more compact state. The decrease of the surface area is also indicative a larger subunit­subunit interface. A comparison of the starting model with a representative structure of the plateau region of the trajectory is reported in Fig. 3. The superimposition of these models clearly

highlights that the structural re-arrangement is associated with a larger interface area. The analysis of the selected atom distances at the dimer interface provides further details on the structural features of this novel dimeric state. Indeed, several close inter-chain and intra-chain molecular contacts between atoms that were rather distant in the starting model were observed in the trajectory structure. The analysis of these interactions show that the subunit­subunit association process is initially driven by the formation of intra-chain Hbonds between residues of Caf1 Ig domain and residues belonging to the loop connecting this domain to the donated N-terminal strand (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, stable H-bonds involving also backbone atoms are formed within the first 5000 ps of the trajectory. As a consequence of these interactions and of the tight association of the N-terminal strand with the other subunit, the two Caf1 subunits come closer. The Caf1­Caf1 association is completed in the later stages ($10,000 ps) of the simulation when direct Hbonds interactions are established by atoms belonging to different subunits (Fig. 4). No major structural variation is observed in the simulation interval 10,000­30,000, thus indicating that these new contacts are rather stable. Interestingly, this large scale Caf1­Caf1 re-organization leads to the formation of H-bonds interactions between atoms that as far as 35 Å in the starting model. The stability of this dimeric assembly prompted us to build a model of Caf1 fiber based on the relative orientation of the two subunits detected in this complex. As shown in Fig. 3B, this approach leads to the building of an elongated end-to-end fiber

model. The cross section of this nearly linear model is in the range 2­2.5 nm, a value which is in agreement with experimental estimates of FGL fibers thickness. Also, the buried surface upon association of Caf1 subunits main bodies (residues 16­149) is about 400 Å2. The limited interface area between subunits [23], whose association is primarily stabilized by interactions mediated by Nterminal strands, is consistent with the observed flexibility of resulting fibers [7,24]. Although other major re-arrangements in the subunit­subunit organization in later stages of fiber formation process may occur, the compatibility of our model with the available experimental data indirectly suggest that Caf1 association at a dimer level plays an important role in determining the structural features of the fiber. Conclusions The atomic level definition of the process that leads to the formation of external organelles essential for the pathogenicity of several bacteria is of paramount importance for both academic and applicative implications [25]. The recent discovery

that chaperone/usher secretion system does not require any external agent to generate the external fibrils [26] suggests that a full definition of the structural bases of this system is achievable. Over the last decade, insightful crystallographic and biochemical investigations have provided illuminating data on the role played by some components of the system. There is increasing evidence that computational approaches may fruitfully complement these studies by providing information on the properties of specific conformational states of monoadhesine and polyadhesine systems whose experimental characterization is difficult. In this scenario, we have here reported a detailed MD characterization of Caf1 subunit in its monomeric unbound state and in its dimeric state. Data on the monomeric form indicate that the unliganded form of the protein is highly reactive and evolves toward more compact states. Notably, this closure of the structure likely hampers the subunit­subunit association process. Therefore, to preserve this individual subunit's high reactivity, that is important for their tight association through the donor-complementation mechanism, and to prevent the collapse of the unliganded Caf1, chaperone release and sub-

unit­subunit association must be simultaneous. This view is in line with recent experimental findings that propend for a concerted mechanism. MD simulations on the Caf1 dimer lead to the formation of a rather stable assembly that is significantly different from the crystallographic arrangement of the two chains. Using the relative orientations of subunits in this dimer, we generated an end-to-end model for the Caf1 capsulae, which is compatible with available experimental data. Since complexes analogous to Caf1M­Caf10 ­Caf100 are available for other polyadhesines and monoadhesines [15], the approach here described may be extended to obtain information on the preferred interaction modes of the monomers of these systems, that may be relevant for the final fiber structure.
