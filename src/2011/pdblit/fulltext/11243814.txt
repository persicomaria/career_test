An instant-evolution experiment was performed on the eight nucleotides comprising the loop region of the 690 hairpin in Escherichia coli 16 S ribosomal RNA. Positions 690 to 697 were randomly mutated and 101 unique functional mutants were isolated, sequenced and analyzed for function in vivo. Non-random nucleotide distributions were observed at each of the mutated positions except 693 and 694. Nucleotide identity signi®cantly affected ribosome function at positions 690, 695, 696 and 697. Pyrimidines were absent at position 696 in the instant-evolution pool as were C at position 691 and G at position 697. A highly signi®cant covariation was observed between nucleotides 690 and 697. No functional double mutants at positions 691 and 696 were obtained from the instant-evolution pool. In our NMR structure of the 690 loop, both the G690 ÁU697 and G691 ÁA696 form sheared hydrogen-bonded mismatches. To further examine the functional constraints between these paired nucleotides, one set of site-directed mutations was constructed at positions 690:697 and another set was constructed at positions 691:696. Functional analysis of the site-directed mutants is consistent with our instant-evolution ®ndings and revealed constraints on the placement of speci®c functional groups observed in the NMR structure. Ten instant-evolution mutants were isolated that are more functional than the wild-type. Hyperactivity in these mutants correlates with a single mutation at position 693.

Introduction
Comparative sequence analysis is a powerful tool for RNA secondary structure prediction. This approach has been used effectively to determine the secondary structures of several large RNAs including the ribosomal RNAs (Gutell et al., 1994), group I introns (Michel & Westhof, 1990), ribonuclease P RNA (Brown et al., 1996), and tRNAs (Sprinzl et al., 1996). Phylogenetic identi®cation of helical regions was initially based upon covariations involving canonical Watson-Crick base-pairs. Improvements in computational methods for comparative

sequence analysis and expansion of sequence databases have allowed extension of secondary structure prediction to include non-canonical base-pairs and base-triplets (Conn et al., 1998; Gautheret et al., 1995; Gutell & Woese, 1990; Haselman et al., 1989; Larsen, 1992). Covariation analysis of functionally important regions of RNAs, however, is limited because these sequences are often highly conserved or invariant. In addition, base to base covariations are context-dependent. The effect of context is particularly signi®cant for non-canonical or mismatch pairs, where nucleotides participate in stacking and H-bonding interactions with more than one nucleotide. Thus, a single nucleotide substitution may dramatically alter RNA tertiary structure. For such sequences, maintaining tertiary structure and molecular function requires multiple, simultaneous substitutions of the interacting nucleotides, an event that is unlikely to occur through spontaneous mutations in vivo.

214 To identify functionally important nucleotides and structural motifs, we developed an in vivo method to isolate and analyze functional sequence variants of 16 S ribosomal RNA, termed instant evolution (Lee et al., 1996, 1997). In an instant-evolution experiment all of the nucleotide positions in a conserved region of RNA are simultaneously randomly mutated and the functional sequences are isolated and analyzed. This permits the isolation of functional sequences that show more variability than those found in nature. In this way, instant evolution allows for the identi®cation of important structural motifs even when they are located within highly conserved functional sequences. The minimum level of function among the instant-evolution pool is determined by the selection procedure. By selecting mutants with a wide range of activities, the effects of substitutions at each position may be correlated with ribosome function. The instant-evolution approach was previously used to determine the key functional and structural elements of the 790 loop (Lee et al., 1997) and basepairing interactions in the 690 region in 16 S rRNA (Morosyuk et al., 2000). Here, we investigated the conserved loop of helix 23b of 16 S rRNA. The 690 loop terminates helix 23b in the central domain of Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA (Figure 1) and has been implicated in tRNA binding at the P-site (Doring et al., 1994; Joseph et al., 1997; Moazed & Noller, 1986, 1990; Osswald et al., 1995; Rinke-Appel et al., 1995), subunit association (Cate et al., 1999; Merryman et al., 1999), interactions with the 790 loop (Atmadja et al., 1986; Clemons et al., 1999), IF3 binding (Muralikrishna & Wickstrom, 1989; Pon et al., 1982; Stof¯er-Meilicke & Stof¯er, 1987) and interactions with S11 protein (Agalarov & Williamson, 2000; Mueller &

Instant Evolution of the 690 Loop

Brimacombe, 1997; Powers & Noller, 1995; Stern et al., 1988). The 690 loop nucleotides were also shown to affect binding of the antibiotics pactamycin and edeine, which inhibit initiation of protein synthesis (Egebjerg & Garrett, 1991; Mankin, 1997; Oehler et al., 1997; Woodcock et al., 1991). Instant evolution was used to identify functional sequence variants of the 690 loop and to determine the sequence and structural elements required for ribosome function. Comparison of the instant-evolution data presented here with the NMR solution structure presented in the accompanying paper (Morosyuk et al., 2001) and the recently determined X-ray crystal structures of the small subunit (Schluenzen et al., 2000; Wimberly et al., 2000) allows correlation of speci®c sequence elements in the 690 loop with ribosome function.

Results
Random mutagenesis and selection of functional mutants To examine the role of the 690 loop in protein synthesis, an instant-evolution experiment was performed in which nucleotides 690 to 697 of E. coli 16 S RNA were randomly mutated and functional sequence combinations were selected and analyzed in vivo. The nucleotides were mutated using PCR and the PCR products were cloned into a derivative of the expression vector pRNA122 (Lee et al., 1996, 1997). In this vector, pRNA123, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) mRNA and the green ¯uorescent protein (GFP) mRNA (Chal®e et al., 1994) are translated only by plasmid-derived ribosomes. The CAT protein renders cells resistant to chloramphenicol and is used to select functional

215 Nucleotide distribution A comparison of the instant-evolution sequence data with the phylogenetic data is shown in Table 2. The instant-evolution sequences showed signi®cantly more variability than those found in nature. This is presumably because all of the positions in the loop were mutated simultaneously and because the mutants were selected at a chloramphenicol concentration that allowed suboptimal sequences to be isolated (Lee et al., 1997). The instant-evolution survivors showed non-random nucleotide distributions at each mutated position, except 693 and 694 (Table 2 and Figure 4(a)). For comparison, a subset of the 101 instant-evolution mutants containing 51 mutants with protein synthesis activities 565 % of the wild-type were also analyzed (Table 2, parentheses). Nucleotide distribution among the 51 highly functional mutants was similar to that observed in the entire instant-evolution pool of 101 mutants. No mutants containing a C at position 690 were present in the highly functional subset of instant-evolution mutants. Statistical analysis of nucleotide variation at each of the other positions, however, was consistent with the decrease in sample size. None of the functional mutants isolated has a C at position 691, U or C at position 696, or G at position 697. Each of these substitutions would disrupt interactions of the 690 loop with nucleotides in the 790 stem loop of 16 S RNA and with ribosomal protein S11 observed in recently published crystal structures of the small ribosomal subunit (Schluenzen et al., 2000; Wimberly et al., 2000) (see Discussion). The mean activities of all mutants at each position were compared by single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Table 3) to determine if nucleotide identity at a given position affected ribosome function (Lee et al., 1997). Positions where nucleotide substitutions signi®cantly affect ribosome function among the instant-evolution mutants are 690, 695, 696, and 697 (Table 3 and Figure 4(a), boxed nucleotides). Since some nucleotides were

mutants. GFP allows rapid and accurate determination of ribosome function by directly measuring ¯uorescence in whole cells. Equal distribution of the four nucleotides at each randomized position in the mutant pool was con®rmed by sequence analysis of a sample of the plasmid library prior to selection (Figure 2(b)). To determine the optimal chloramphenicol concentration for selection, 8000-20,000 transformants were plated on selection medium containing 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 or 300 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Following incubation, the survivors were counted and assayed for GFP translation (not shown). From these data, 200 mg/ml chloramphenicol was determined as the optimal concentration for selection of the 690 loop instant-evolution mutants (see Materials and Methods). Mutants were selected, sequenced, and assayed for ribosome function by measuring the amount of GFP produced by each mutant strain. A total of 500,000 transformants were obtained to ensure that all of the mutant sequences were represented in the original pool with >99.9 % con®dence (Clarke & Carbon, 1976). Out of these 500,000 transformants, only 186 clones containing 101 unique sequences survived the selection (Table 1). The number of mutations per survivor ranged from one to six (Table 1) and 72 of the isolates had three or four mutations (Figure 3(a)). The level of function ranged from 22 to 124 % of the wild-type (Table 1). Overall, the number of mutations in the 690 loop was inversely proportional to the level of ribosome function (Figure 3(b)). It is interesting that seven mutants were as functional as wild-type, and ten of the mutants produced more GFP than the wild-type. Although most of these hyperactive mutants contained multiple mutations, all of them contained nucleotide substitutions at position 693 and one of them (Table 1, sequence 2) contained a single G693U substitution and produced 22 % more GFP than the wild-type. These data suggest that mutations at position 693 affect the rate of protein synthesis (see Discussion).

absent at position 691 in the instant-evolution mutants, these substitutions may also affect ribosome function. It should be noted, however, that the frequency with which a particular nucleotide is represented does not depend directly upon the effect of that nucleotide on function. Instead, it re¯ects the number of random sequences containing that nucleotide that are functional at or above the level required to survive chloramphenicol selection. The mutants containing purine bases at position 690, on average, are 20 % more functional than those with pyrimidines. Only three G695-containing mutants were isolated. The average function of these three mutants was 32 %. These data suggest that only a small number of sequences in the mutant pool containing G695 are functional. The only substitution of A696 was a transition to G found in 19 out of 101 sequences. Covariation analysis To identify potentially functionally signi®cant nucleotide covariations among the instant-evolution mutants, we examined the distribution of each pair of mutated nucleotides. For this we used the chi-squared (w2) contingency test for independence to determine how close the observed nucleotide frequencies were to the expected frequencies if no functional interactions existed. The probability (p) that the observed covariation is due to random ¯uctuations is provided: chi-squared probabilities less than 0.001 (w2, p < 0.001) are considered stat-

istically signi®cant. The most signi®cant covariations found in the 690 loop are shown by arrows in Figure 4(a). Positions 690 and 697 showed the most signi®cant covariation (w2, p  2.5 Â 10À18), suggesting the existence of a functionally important interaction between nucleotides at these positions (Figure 4(a), unbroken arrow). The G690:U697 pair is highly conserved evolutionarily, with rare occurrences of A690 and no substitutions of U697 in bacterial ribosomes (Table 2). Among the instant-evolution mutants, 59 have a G690:U697 pair. The other most frequently represented combinations between positions 690 and 697 are 15 U:C, six A:A, and ten A:U pairs, suggesting that these mutants share functionally important features with the wild-type G690:U697 pair (see Discussion). For positions 691 and 696, there were no double mutants, prohibiting meaningful covariation analysis between these two positions. A strong preference for particular pairs with one substitution, however, was observed. Among the instantevolution mutants, 68 contain the wild-type G691:A696 pair. The other 691:696 isolates are 19 G:G, nine U:A, and ®ve A:A pairs. No other combinations were isolated. Though sequence variation at positions 691 and 696 was too constrained to provide statistically signi®cant covariation, the functional nucleotide pairs obtained in the instant-evolution selection are each capable of forming structures isomorphous with the sheared G ÁA conformation observed in the NMR structure

of the 690 loop (Morosyuk et al., 2001) (see Discussion). Therefore, the covariation between 691 and 696 is shown in Figure 4(a) by a broken arrow.

We also found three weak (p > 0.01) covariations in the loop between positions 691 and 695 (w2, p  0.05), between positions 692 and 695 (w2, p  0.04), and between positions 694 and 696 (w2, p  0.04). The 691:695 pair, however, had only ®ve double mutants, which is not suf®cient to draw a de®nitive conclusion about covariation. Positions 693 and 694 showed no covariation with any other mutated position in the loop. These covariations appear to be due to selection against stable pairing combinations between positions 692 and 695 that would disrupt functionally important interactions such as the 691-696 mismatch (see Discussion). Site-directed mutagenesis of the 690:697 and 691:696 base-pairs Analysis of the instant-evolution mutants suggested the existence of functionally important interactions between G690 and U697 and between G691 and A696. In addition, nucleotide variation at three of these positions, 690, 697, and 696, correlates with ribosome function (Figure 4(a)). To examine the nature of the functional constraints at these positions more closely, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct all 15 nucleotide combinations between positions 690 and 697 and between 691 and 696 without changing other nucleotides in the 690 loop. Functional data for the 690:697 and 691:696 mutants are consistent with the analyses of the instant-evolution mutants and are summarized in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Ribosome function in the 690:697 mutants varied from 22.4 % (C:G) to 89 % (A:U) of the control (Figure 5). Each of the single and double mutants with functions greater than 45 % of the wild-type was represented at least once in the pool of instant-evolution mutants. Mutants with functions less than 45 % were excluded from the instant-evolution pool. Out of 15 site-directed mutants of the 690:697 pair, the G690:C697 (30.5 %) and C690:G697 (22.4 %) pairs have the lowest function, indicating that formation of a strong Watson-Crick

219 motif (Gutell et al., 2000). Other RNA hexaloops also form structures that share many similar features with the 690 loop including the GÁA sheared pair, the U-turn, and stacking of the nucleotides in the minor groove. Two examples are the GUAAUA loop sequence of the L11 binding site in the 23 S rRNA (Fountain et al., 1996; Huang et al., 1996) and the GUAACA sequence of the loop IIa from U2 snRNA (Stallings & Moore, 1997). It is interesting that both of these sequences are found among the 690 loop instant-evolution mutants (Table 1, sequences 41 and 38, respectively). Nucleotide U692 in the 690 loop appears to be phylogenetically conserved because it forms favorable stacking interactions and has an imino group for hydrogen bonding with the phosphate backbone across the loop. G and C have also been shown to facilitate turning of the phosphate backbone in RNA in a U-turn motif (Jucker et al., 1996; Su et al., 1999). Under the relaxed constraints of the instant-evolution experiment, however, 55 sequences were isolated that do not strictly adhere to the UNR motif. Eight sequences have a purine at position 692 and 50 sequences have a pyrimidine at position 694. By comparing our structural data with the instant-evolution analyses, we conclude that nucleotides 692-695 must form a turn at the top of the loop but that these nucleotides need not adhere to the UNR motif. The functional signi®cance of the 690 U-turn is discussed below. All naturally occurring bacterial sequences except one (U) contain an A at position 695. The instantevolution pool contained only three A695G mutants with an average function of 32 % (Tables 2 and 3). Approximately equal numbers of mutants containing A, C, and U at position 695 were isolated. The X-ray structure reported by Wimberly et al. places Ê the A695-N1 within H-bonding distance (3.3 A) of G786-N2; an interaction that would be disrupted by A695G substitution, which would place two Hbond donors in close proximity (Wimberly et al., 2000). Weak covariations were observed between position 695 and positions 691 and 692 (Figure 4). It is possible that G at position 695 was selected against among the instant-evolution mutants because it hydrogen bonds with other nucleotides and disrupts the functional conformation of the loop. Similar patterns were observed among the instant-evolution mutants at positions 792 and 793 of 16 S rRNA (Lee et al., 1997). Structure versus function It is dif®cult to separate structure from function in catalytic RNAs because even single-nucleotide changes may alter the structure of an RNA molecule enough to cause large changes in function. Multiple compensatory mutations, however, may preserve the active form. Since single structural mutations often cause signi®cant loss of function, compensatory mutations must occur simultaneously in nature and are therefore extremely rare. As a result, the conserved, functionally

base-pair between positions 690 and 697 inhibits ribosome function. The 691:696 site-directed mutants show a very different functional pro®le from the 690:697 pair mutants (Figure 6). Only three single mutants retained a signi®cant level of function, A691:A697 (94.1 %), U691:A691 (88 %), and G691:G696 (87.8 %). These three mutants were also the only variants of the 691:696 pair isolated in the instantevolution mutants, providing further evidence that these nucleotide pairs share functionally important features with the wild-type sheared G691:A696 pair observed in the NMR structure (see Discussion). All of the other site-directed mutants at positions 691 and 696 produced ribosomes that were less than 25 % as functional as the wild-type. The double pyrimidine-pyrimidine mutants were all less than 5 % as functional as the control.

Discussion
Instant-evolution versus phylogeny Here, we use instant evolution to identify functionally signi®cant nucleotides and nucleotide interactions within the conserved 690 loop of E. coli 16 S rRNA. Sequence analysis revealed more variability in the instant-evolution mutants than observed in phylogenetic ribosomal RNA databases (Table 2). Instant-evolution experiments identify the major factors affecting function in a de®ned RNA sequence. Both the system and the selection scheme were designed to allow isolation of suboptimal sequences. Therefore, it is likely that the greater variability observed among the instantevolution mutants when compared with phylogenetic databases is due to the relaxed functional constraints imposed during selection of the instantevolution mutants. By correlating nucleotide variation with GFP production in the instant-evolution pool, we identi®ed individual nucleotides and nucleotide interactions that are important for ribosome function. Substitution patterns in the instant-evolution mutants were similar to those observed in nature at all positions except 693, 694 and 695, which showed very little or no nucleotide preference or correlation of nucleotide identity with ribosome function (Tables 2 and 3). Purine bases are strongly preferred at positions 693 and 694 among naturally occurring ribosomes, but in the instant-evolution mutants all four nucleotides are equally represented. In addition, no correlation between nucleotide identity and ribosome function was observed at these positions. In the accompanying paper (Morosyuk et al., 2001), the NMR structure shows that nucleotides 692-695 form a U-turn motif (Figure 4(b)) closed by a sheared G691 ÁA696 pair, consistent with the de®nition for a classic Uturn with UNR consensus sequence closed by a mismatch with sheared geometry (Gutell et al., 2000). More than 99 % of naturally occurring 690 loop sequences are consistent with the U-turn

important nucleotides in ribosomal RNA are often located among equally conserved nucleotides whose role is primarily structural. In instant-evolution experiments, all of the nucleotides in a particular region are simultaneously mutated and only functional sequences are isolated. Because these sequences are selected for sub-optimal levels of function, alternative nucleotide combinations among structurally important positions are isolated. Nucleotides directly involved in function, such as those involved in intermolecular interactions, however, generally show little variation (Lee et al., 1997). Comparison of sequence variation patterns among the instant-evolution mutants allows identi®cation of structurally important

nucleotide motifs. Thus, one application of instantevolution is to provide functional signi®cance for the structural motifs observed in NMR and X-ray crystallographic structures. Here, we correlate instant-evolution function with the NMR solution structure of the 690 loop to identify the key structural elements required for function (Figure 4). Functional significance of G690 ÁU697 A highly signi®cant covariation was observed between positions 690 and 697 (Figure 4(a)), suggesting the existence of a functional interaction between these two nucleotides. These ®ndings are consistent with our previous instant-evolution stu-

Figure 4. The 690 loop structure and function. (a) Summary of sequence and covariation analysis of the 690 loop instant-evolution mutants. Nucleotide font size at each mutated position in the loop is proportional to the occurrence of this base in the 101 instant-evolution mutants (Table 2A). Positions that show a signi®cant correlation between level of function and nucleotide identity are boxed. The signi®cant covariation observed between position 690 and 697 (p  2.5 Â 10À18) is indicated by the unbroken arrow. The proposed covariation between 691 and 696 is shown by a broken arrow. Only the covariations with p < 0.001 are shown. We also found three weak covariations in the loop, between positions 691 and 695 (w2, p  0.05), 692 and 695 (w2, p  0.04), and 694 and 696 (w2, p  0.04). (b) The NMR solution structure of the 690 loop (Morosyuk et al. 2000, 2001). The nucleotides from 693 to 697 form an array of stacked bases in the minor groove of the 690 loop with the Watson-Crick functional groups available for interactions. The U-turn of the phosphate backbone occurs between U692 and G693. Two sheared mismatches are formed at the base of the loop between G690 and U697 and between G691 and A696. (b) NMR solution structure of the 690 loop. Different structural motifs found in the NMR structure are color-coded. The green pair is the sheared single H-bond G690 ÁU697 mismatch, the red pair is the sheared G691Á A696 mismatch, the blue nucleotides form the U692-G693A694 U-turn, and the A695 nucleotide stacked in the minor groove is yellow.

dies of the 690 stem nucleotides (Morosyuk et al., 2000). At position 690, G is conserved with rare occurrences of A690 among naturally occurring bacterial ribosomal RNA sequences and U697 is invariant among bacterial ribosomes (Table 2). The 690 loop NMR solution structure revealed a novel sheared type G690 ÁU697 mismatch (Morosyuk et al., 2001). To determine the functional signi®cance of this novel structural motif, we examined the effect of each 690:697 mutant pair among the instant-evolution mutants on GFP synthesis in vivo. Among the 51 instant-evolution mutants with function 565 % of the wild-type (Tables 2 and 3), 40 are GÁ U (average function  91 %), four are A ÁU (75 %), three are A Á A (78 %), three are U ÁC (69 %), and one is A ÁC (66 %). Each of these mutant pairs is able to form a structure isomorphous with the sheared GÁ U observed in the 690 NMR solution structure (Figure 7) (Auf®nger & Westhof, 1999), suggesting that the sheared conformation is required for function. An alternative explanation is that the sheared conformation facilitates proper placement of an essential functional group either in the 690-697 pair or elsewhere in the loop. In the crystal structure reported by Wimberly et al. (2000) a hydrogen bond was observed between the O2 of U697 and the NH2 of G785.

To further examine the 690-697 interaction, we constructed and analyzed all 15 mutant combinations at positions 690 and 697 (Figure 5). If the sheared conformation is important for ribosome function, the site-directed mutants able to form structures isomorphous with the sheared G ÁU observed in the NMR structure should be more functional than those unable to form isomorphous structures. On the other hand, if proper placement of an H-bond acceptor at position 697 is the critical functional determinant, then combinations that either do not have an H-bond acceptor or that produce a structure where the H-bond acceptor cannot access the NH2 of G785 should have low function. Based on current literature, nucleotide pairs predicted to form isomorphous structures with the sheared G ÁU are A Á A, U ÁC, G ÁA, C ÁA, A ÁC, U ÁA, C ÁC and G ÁG as shown in Figures 7 and 8 (Auf®nger & Westhof, 1999; Batey et al., 2000; Leontis & Westhof, 1998a,b). The functional data for each of the 16 site-directed mutants are shown in Figure 5. The order of function of the site-directed mutants is G ÁU > A Á U > C ÁU > A Á A > U ÁC > GÁ A > A Á> C ÁA > U Á U > U ÁA4A ÁG > U Á G > G ÁG > C Á CC4G ÁC 4C ÁG. The predicted isomorphous pairs are the most functional of the site-directed mutants with the exceptions of C ÁC and GÁG, which are only 39 % and 41 % as functional as the wild-type. We

222 showed previously that proper pairing among the 690 stem nucleotides is essential for ribosome function (Morosyuk et al., 2000). Secondary structure predictions (mfold) (Zuker, 1989) of the C690:C697 site-directed mutant show the formation of a nonfunctional secondary structure in which C690 is paired with G700 and C697 is paired with G693. The stability of the predicted structure is À2.2 kcal/ mol more stable than the functionally active structure in which G688 is paired with C699 (Morosyuk et al., 2000). Therefore, the C Á C site-directed mutant is probably less functional than expected because it permits formation of a nonfunctional secondary structure in the 690 hairpin. The 690Á697 sitedirected mutants, A ÁC, A ÁU, C ÁU, and U ÁU, however, all show greater function than expected since these pairs have not previously been predicted to assume a conformation isomorphous with the sheared GÁU observed in our NMR structure. As shown in Figure 7, however, A ÁC can form an isomorphous sheared pair stabilized by a single hydrogen bond. The high level of function observed for A ÁU, C ÁU, and U ÁU suggests that even though they cannot form hydrogen bonds in the sheared conformation they can form structures in vivo that place the U697-O2 functional group in a position where it is available for interaction with G785. Therefore, though most of the functional pairs in the instantevolution and site-directed mutants are able to form structures isomorphous with the sheared G ÁU observed in our NMR structure, it is likely that this is because a hydrogen bond is required between G785-NH2 and an appropriately positioned H-bond acceptor at position 697. Comparison of the functional and non-functional 690 Á697 nucleotide pairs shows that those with a G at 697 have low activity while those with A, C, and U are >65 % as functional as the wild-type. Each of the predicted structures formed by isomorphous replacement of U697 with A or C contains a hydrogen-bond acceptor in the minor groove of the 690 stem (Figure 4). Substitution of G at position 697, however, would place a hydrogen-bond donor (amino) in the corresponding position, which would require structural perturbation to interact with G785. This may explain why the G690 ÁG697 mutant is less functional than expected. Functional significance of the G691 ÁA696 mismatch Among the bacteria, G691 is found in all but six sequences and A696 is universally conserved (Table 2). In our NMR structure A696 stacks between A695 and U697 and forms a sheared pair with G691. In addition, in the Wimberly et al. (2000) structure, N1 and N6 of A696 form two hydrogen bonds to the 2H -OH of C797. In spite of the relaxed functional constraints imposed by instant-evolution selection, very little sequence variation was obtained at positions 691 and 696 (Figure 4(a)). Though lack of double mutations at positions 691 and 696 prohibited meaningful covariation analysis, strong preferences for particular

pairs containing single mutations were observed. Among the 51 instant-evolution mutants with function 565 % of the wild-type (Tables 1 and 2), 37 are GÁ A (average function  91 %), ®ve are A ÁA (77 %), four are U ÁA (85 %), and ®ve are G ÁG (70 %). Three features are shared by these 691-696 functional isolates: (1) they are all capable of forming a sheared geometry (Figure 8); (2) they all contain a purine at position 696 that would promote stable stacking interactions with A695 and U697; and (3) they are all able to form hydrogen bonds to the 2H -OH of C797. Since so little variability between positions 691 and 696 was observed among the instant-evolution mutants, all nucleotide combinations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed for function (Figure 6). As with the 690:697 mutants, if the three common features identi®ed for the 691 Á696 pairs isolated in the instantevolution pool are important for ribosome function, site-directed mutants possessing these features should be more functional than those without them. The functional data for each of the 15 site-directed mutants is shown in Figure 6. The mutants fall into three functional classes: the class I mutants (UA, GG and AA) all had near wild-type function, (mean activity  90 %); class II mutants (UG, CA and AG) had low function (22 %) and the remaining mutants (class III) were non-functional (3 %). All of the mutants in class I contain a purine at position 696, are able to assume the sheared geometry, and are all able to form hydrogen bonds to the 2H -OH of C797. The class II mutants all contained a purine at position 696, but are unlikely to form sheared pairs. Based on current literature, nucleotide pairs predicted to form isomorphous structures with the sheared G ÁA are GÁ U, A ÁA, U ÁC, C ÁA, A Á C, U ÁA, GÁG and C ÁC as shown in Figures 7 and 8 (Auf®nger & Westhof, 1999; Batey et al., 2000; Leontis & Westhof, 1998a,b; Morosyuk et al., 2001). Three of the 691Á696 pairs (U Á C, C ÁC, and C Á A) produced ribosomes with signi®cantly lower function than expected (Figure 7). Secondary structure analysis (mfold) of these site-directed mutants predicts formation of non-functional secondary structures in which position 691 is paired with G698. The predicted structures are À1.4 to À4.8 kcal/mol more stable than the functionally active structure. Therefore, the U Á C, CÁC, and CÁA site-directed mutants probably form non-functional secondary structures in the 690 hairpin in vivo. This is consistent with the low function observed in the C ÁA mutant even though it contains a purine at position 696, since it is unlikely that the resulting secondary structure permits H-bond formation from A696 to C797. The only class III mutant with a purine in positions 696 (C:G) cannot form a sheared pair and is most likely to form a Watson-Crick pair. The resulting structure would disrupt the stacking interactions observed in this region of the 690 loop and prevent H-bond formation with C797.

Figure 7. Isomorphous substitutions at positions 690 and 697. Mutant nucleotide pairs were modeled into the 690Á697 G ÁU NMR mismatch structure using the Builder module of Biosym InsightII without energy minimization. Each of these mutant pairs is able to form hydrogen-bonding interactions isomorphous with the sheared G690Á U697 observed in the NMR structure. Similar isosteric sheared pairs were observed previously in tRNA positions 32-38 for A Á A, GÁA, C Á A, U Á C and UÁ A (Auf®nger & Westhof, 1999). An isosteric sheared pair similar to the A Á C pair shown was proposed based on phylogenetic variation at positions A72 ÁC104 in 5 S rRNA (Leontis & Westhof, 1998a).

The instant-evolution data suggest that certain pairs of nucleotides inhibit ribosome function by disrupting some essential structural feature of the 690 loop. We compared function in each of the site-directed double mutants with the corresponding single mutants (Table 4). Functional activity in double mutants should be approximately equal to the product of the functional activities of each of the corresponding single mutants if the two mutation sites do not interact. As shown in Table 4, each of the double mutants is less functional than would be predicted if they were independent. Therefore, functional analysis of the 691 Á696 single mutants A Á A (94.1 %) and G ÁG (87.8 %) predicts that the function of the A Á G double mutant would be 82.6 % if no interaction occurred between nucleotides at these positions. The actual function of the A ÁG double mutant, however, is 18.7 %. Similar patterns are observed for all of the 691 Á696 double mutants, suggesting that formation of an incorrect interaction inhibits ribosome function since none of the double mutants that form the correct secondary structure is capable of forming a sheared pair isomorphous with GÁA. Since each of

the functional 691 Á696 pairs can form a sheared structure (Figure 8) that contains a purine at position 696, we conclude that these two features are required for ribosome function. In the NMR structure, nearly ideal stacking of the sheared G690 ÁU697 and G691 ÁA696 pairs is observed (Figure 4(b)) (Morosyuk et al., 2001). These data suggest that G691 Á A696 in combination with G690 ÁU697 form a structure that is essential for ribosome function. Functional significance of the U-turn As shown by our 690 NMR structure, the wildtype sequence of the 690 loop folds into a structure similar to the anticodon loop of tRNA as well as several other RNAs that participate in receptor interactions (Auf®nger & Westhof, 1999; Morosyuk et al., 2001; Pley et al., 1994; Stallings & Moore, 1997). In addition, the phylogenetic data for the tRNA anticodon stem (Figure 9) resemble our instant-evolution data for the 690 loop (Figure 4(a)). Each of these RNAs shares the common motifs of a closing sheared pair, stacked nucleotides on the 3H

Figure 8. Isomorphous substitutions at positions 691 and 696. Mutant nucleotide pairs were modeled into the 691Á696 G ÁA NMR mismatch structure using the Builder module of Biosym InsightII without energy minimization. Each of these mutant pairs is able to form hydrogen-bonding interactions isomorphous with the sheared G691Á A696 observed in the NMR structure. Structures similar to those shown for G ÁA, AÁ A and UÁA have been previously observed in X-ray crystal structures (Auf®nger & Westhof, 1999). A sheared mismatch structure similar to the predicted G691ÁG696 mismatch is observed in the SRP crystal structure, which has a hydrogen bond from G162-N2 to Ê G149-O6 (2.81 A) and a somewhat longer distance to G149-N7 Ê (3.56 A) (Batey et al., 2000).

side of the loop, and a U-turn. In the wild-type sequence, G693 is located at the top of the loop, stacked upon A694 with its functional groups exposed to solvent (Figure 4). A number of studies have implicated this residue in ribosome function. Nucleotide 32 in the anticodon loops of both P-site and E-site bound tRNAs crosslink with G693 in 16 S RNA (Doring et al., 1994). In addition, G693 is protected from kethoxal modi®cation by P-site bound tRNA (Moazed & Noller, 1986, 1990). Kethoxal modi®cation of G693, however, does not prevent P-site tRNA binding (von Ahsen & Noller, 1995). Nucleotides in the 690 loop were also identi®ed as targets for cleavage by P-site bound anticodon stem loops derivatized with EDTA-Fe(II) (Joseph et al., 1997). These authors speculated that the 690 loop and the 790 loop in the 30 S subunit are positioned such that they would block translocation of tRNA from the P site to the E site and that these loops may have to move as the tRNA shifts from the P site to the E site. These data suggest that G693 either binds to tRNA in the P site or binds to another portion of the translational machinery upon tRNA binding to the P site. The X-ray structure of the 30 S subunit suggests that a stacking interaction forms between G693 and the 5H nucleotide of the E site codon of mRNA. No nucleotide preference was observed at position 693 among the instant-evolution mutants (Table 2A), though G693 is phylogenetically highly conserved (Table 2B). Interestingly, position 693 was mutated in all of the ten instant-evolution isolates with function greater than that of the wildtype (Table 1). One of these mutants (Table 1, sequence 2) contained a single G693U substitution but produced 22 % more GFP than the wild-type. Therefore, mutations at position 693 do not prevent tRNA binding to the P site, but instead appear to

increase the rate of protein synthesis. These data are consistent with modi®cation interference experiments showing that kethoxal modi®cation of G693 does not prevent tRNA binding to the ribosomal P site (von Ahsen & Noller, 1995). In the 30 S structure reported by Wimberly et al. (2000) G693 is stacked on the 5H base of the E-site codon in an mRNA analog. Although our data provide no insight as to the mechanism for the observed increase in protein synthesis, it is possible that mutations at position 693 decrease ribosome af®nity for tRNA or affect subunit association, since both of these activities have been associated with the 690 hairpin. The inverse relationship between protein synthesis rate and error rate has been known for some time (Allen & Noller, 1989, 1991; Dong & Kurland, 1995; Gorini, 1971; Ninio, 1974; Pettersson & Kurland, 1980; Thompson & Karim, 1982). Mutations resulting in increased protein synthesis rates but reduced ®delity have been described in both rRNA and ribosomal proteins (Alksne et al., 1993; O'Connor et al., 1992; Piepersberg et al., 1979; Pinard et al., 1994). In our system, mutated ribosomes translate only the CAT and GFP mRNAs. Because both CAT and GFP are relatively small proteins, even a tenfold decrease in translational ®delity would probably be undetectable by GFP assay. A 20 % increase in GFP production, however, is easily detectable. In normal cells, ribosomes must translate thousands of mRNAs and minor changes in error rate are more likely to affect cell viability (Ruusala et al., 1984). This may explain why G693 is conserved among naturally occurring rRNA sequences but is highly variable among the instant-evolution mutants.

Conclusions The data presented here indicate the existence of two functionally important regions in the 690 hairpin of ribosomal RNA. The base of the loop forms the structural core of the molecule and is de®ned by a novel sheared G690 ÁU697 mismatch and a sheared G691 Á A696 mismatch. The sheared conformation was shown by instant-evolution and sitedirected mutagenesis studies to be functionally important for proper placement of nucleotide funcTable 4.

tional groups involved in interactions with other parts of the translational machinery. The contiguously stacked G693 to U697 residues interact with ribosomal protein S11 and nucleotides in the 790 stem and are protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage by subunit association (Merryman et al., 1999). Cate et al. (1999) identi®ed an intersubunit bridge B7 involving an interaction between the minor groove of the 690 hairpin and the adjacent internal loop of 16 S rRNA and domain IV of 23 S rRNA. Several studies suggest that the 690 region and the adjacent internal loop undergo structural rearrangement during protein synthesis (Agrawal et al., 1998; Joseph et al., 1997; McCutcheon et al., 1999; Moazed & Noller, 1989; Mueller et al., 1997; Stark et al., 1997). All of our mutants with increased translation rates contained a mutation at position 693. In our NMR structure, G693 is located at the apex of the 690 loop and in the crystal structure, G693 stacks on an mRNA analogue in the E site. Taken together, these data suggest that the 690 hairpin is a key component of a conformational switch that occurs during 70 S formation and/or during translocation. The mutational data presented here reveal a number of structural motifs that correlate with ribosome function through the correct placement of speci®c functional groups that appear to be required for interaction with other parts of the translational machinery. These structure/function models are being tested by genetic complementation studies and structure determination of speci®c rRNA mutants.

Instant Evolution of the 690 Loop transformants were obtained yielding approximately one chloramphenicol-resistant transformant per 2500 transformants plated. From the chloramphenicol selection plates, 186 survivors were randomly selected, subcultured and sequenced between the BglII and SacII ligation sites to identify the mutations and to verify the absence of unprogrammed mutations in the PCR products. Site-directed mutagenesis of nucleotides at positions 690, 697, 691 and 696 All possible single and double mutants of the 690:697 pair, and the 691:696 pair were constructed ®rst in pRNA16ST using unique BglII and SacII restriction sites and then cloned to pRNA123 using BstEII. Each set of mutations was constructed using a single mutagenic primer. The mutagenic PCR primer for the 690:697 mutants was 5H -CGGTATTCCTCCAGATCTCTACGCNTTTCAC NGCTACACCTGGAATTCTA-3H and for the 691:696 mutants was 5H -CGGTATTCCTCCAGATCTCTACGCA NTTCANCGCTACACCTGGAATTCTA-3H . E. coli DH5 cells were transformed with the mutated plasmids and transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml). The mutations were identi®ed by sequence analysis of plasmids isolated from the transformants. GFP assays Overnight cultures were diluted 1:1000 in LB-Amp100 medium and grown at 37  C with shaking until A600  0.1. IPTG was then added to a ®nal concentration of 1 mM and incubated with shaking for an additional three hours. Following incubation, 1 ml of each culture was removed for assay, the cells were pelleted, washed twice in 1 ml of HN buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.85 % NaCl), and resuspended in 1 ml of the NH buffer. Cell density (A600) was determined using a SPECTRAmax 190 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and ¯uorescence (excitation  395 nm, emission  509 nm) was measured using a SPECTRAmax GEMINI microplate ¯uorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For each culture, ¯uorescence was divided by A600 and presented as a percentage of the wild-type. Values represent the average of at least three assays on three separate cultures.

Materials and Methods
Reagents Restriction enzymes, ligase, and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA, and from Life Technologies (Bethesda , MD). DNA sequencing was performed in-house with a Li-Cor (Lincoln, NE) Global IR2 DNA sequencer. Sequencing enzymes, nucleotides, and sequencing buffers were from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were either purchased from Life Technologies or synthesized in-house using a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer. Amplitaq DNA polymerase and PCR reagents were from PE-Biosystems. Plasmids Construction of pRNA123 and pRNA16ST will be described elsewhere. The plasmid pRNA123 was derived from pRNA122 (Lee et al., 1996, 1997) by subcloning the green ¯uorescent protein (GFP) gene into pRNA122. In this vector, (CAT) mRNA and the GFP mRNA (Chal®e et al., 1994) are translated only by plasmid-derived ribosomes. The CAT protein renders cells resistant to chloramphenicol and is used to select functional mutants. GFP allows rapid and accurate determination of ribosome function by measuring ¯uorescence directly in whole cells. As in pRNA122, the ribosomal RNA operon is under transcriptional regulation of the lacUV5 promoter (Brosius et al., 1981). The pRNA16ST construct is similar to pRNA122 but the 23 S rRNA gene has been deleted to provide more unique restriction sites in the 16 S RNA gene. Bacterial strains and media All plasmids were maintained and expressed in E. coli DH5 (supE44, hsdR17, recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, relA1) (Hanahan, 1983). Cultures were grown in LB medium (Luria & Burrous, 1957) or LB medium containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin (LB-Amp100). To induce synthesis of plasmid-derived rRNA from the lacUV5 promoter, IPTG was added to a ®nal concentration of 1 mM. Strains were transformed by electroporation (Dower et al., 1988) using a Gibco-BRL Cell Electroporator. Transformants were grown in SOC medium (Hanahan, 1983) for one hour prior to plating on selective medium to allow expression of plasmid-derived genes. Random mutagenesis and selection All PCR-directed mutagenesis experiments (Higuchi, 1989) were performed by subcloning the PCR-ampli®ed DNA into pRNA16ST using the unique BglII and SacII restriction sites. The PCR upper primer, 690N-697N, was 5H -CGGTATTCCTCCAGATCTCTACGCNNNNNNNNG CTACACCTGGAATTCTA-3H (N  A, T, C, and G) and the lower primer, 16S-AvrII, was 5H -ACGTCGCAAGACCAAAGAGG-3H . The upper and lower primers were designed to bind to the BglII restriction site and outside of the SacII restriction site, respectively. The library of random mutants in pRNA16ST was then cloned into pRNA123 using BstEII. Transformants were incubated in SOC medium containing 1 mM IPTG for three hours to induce rRNA synthesis and then plated on LB-Amp100 agar with and without 200 mg/ml chloramphenicol. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chloramphenicol for cells expressing wild-type rRNA from pRNA123 plasmid is approximately 650 mg/ml. A total of 500,000
