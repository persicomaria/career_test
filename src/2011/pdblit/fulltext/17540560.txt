Abstract--A series of macrocyclic derivatives has been designed and synthesized based on the X-ray co-crystal structures of pyrazolo[1,5-a] [1,3,5]triazines with corn CK2 (cCK2) protein. Bioassays demonstrated that these macrocyclic pyrazolo[1,5-a] [1,3,5]triazine compounds are potent CK2 inhibitors with Ki around 1.0 nM and strongly inhibit cancer cell growth with IC50 as low as 100 nM.

Protein kinase CK2 is a highly conserved and pleiotropic serine/threonine kinase that plays key roles in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. It is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of normal cells, but is particularly more abundant in the nucleus compartment of cancer cells.1 It is comprised of a heterotetrameric structure of a2b2, aa 0 b2 or a 0 2b2 where the a or a 0 subunits are catalytic, while the b subunit provides the anchor for assembly of the scaffold and interacts with CK2's various protein substrates. The a and a 0 subunits are highly homologous for a large part of the amino acid sequence, only differing significantly in the extreme C terminus where homology is essentially non-existent.2 CK2 has been observed to be frequently up-regulated in a wide variety of human cancers examined.3­5 Targeted overexpression of CK2 catalytic subunits results in tumoriogenesis in animal and cellular models, and CK2 has been demonstrated to increase a cell's oncogenic potential by sensitizing a cell to transformation by other oncogenic proteins.6 Down-regulation of CK2 activity has been demonstrated to decrease cellular proliferation as well as to induce apoptosis in cancer cells.7 Various approaches have been em-

ployed to study the cancer related bio-functions of CK2, such as, the use of small molecule inhibitors, dominant negative overexpression of kinase inactive mutants,8 anti-sense CK2a oligodeoxynucleotide,7 as well as small interfering RNA molecules (siRNA).9 Recent studies by Ahmed and co-workers10 demonstrated that antisense CK2a caused cancer cell death in vitro as well as in a PC3 xenograft model due to induction of apoptosis. Complete eradication of the tumor was observed with higher concentrations of the antisense agents. The effect on normal and non-cancer cells however was minimal under the same conditions. Clearly, data presented by these studies support the rationale of inhibiting CK2 as a potential approach for cancer therapy. Specific,

potent, and cell-permeable inhibitors of CK2 have been developed in the past,11 with Ki values in the submicromolar range (the best being 20 nM).11b These compounds have also shown a remarkable pro-apoptotic effect by down-regulating CK2 activity when tested against multiple cancer cell lines. Therefore, development of cell-permeable CK2 inhibitors should lead to potential anti-cancer drugs. Recently, we described pyrazolo[1,5-a] [1,3,5]triazines 1 (Fig. 1) as potent inhibitors of protein kinase CK2 (Ki < 1 nM).12 However, these compounds exhibited only relative weak cellular activity against prostate and colon cancer cell lines with IC50 at low lM levels. The nature of a near planar molecular structure for this class of compounds as observed in the X-ray co-crystal structure (Fig. 2) presumably produces poor membrane permeability and thus poor cellular activity. As we discussed in the preceding paper,12 the cis-acetamide group provided two strong hydrogen bond interactions with protein residues Asp175 and Lys68, which induced the C2-phenyl group to adopt an extended conCN CN CN NC a,b N N H 2 CN f N HO N 4 CN h N N HN N N S 6 CO2Me j NH 2 N HN N N N N H 9 k,l N N HN N N N H 10 HN CN i N N N O 7 N S O 8 HN N S Cl CN NH 2 HO c,d N N N 3 N SH

formation and bury into the hydrophobic back pocket. It was observed that the methyl group of cis-acetamide ° was only about 4 A away from the nitrogen atom of C8-nitrile group. Therefore, an appropriately placed spatial alkyl chain would provide a linkage between C8 and the acetamide to form a macrocyclic system. By design, macrocyclic pyrazolotriazines could be beneficial in several aspects. First, an alkyl chain would fit into the deep hydrophobic cavity composed of hydrophobic residues, such as Val95, Phe113, Val53, and Ile174, to provide maximal interactions between ligand and protein. Second, the conformationally constrained cis-acetamide could still interact with Asp175 and Lys68 to form two strong hydrogen bonds for enhanced potency as well as significantly increased metabolic stability of the acetamide, facilitating in vivo animal studies. Third and most importantly, an alkyl side chain in the macrocyclic system would form a bulge out from the molecule and change the planar characteristics of non-cyclized pyrazolotriazines to improve their cell membrane permeability. In direct comparison, compound 10 was synthesized by following the procedure described in Scheme 1. 1,5-Dicyanopentane was treated with NaH followed by ethylformate to give an intermediate, 2-formylheptanedinitrile, which was then cyclized with hydrazine, providing 4-substituted amino pyrazole 2. Using a similar procedure as described earlier,12 pyrazolotriazine 3 was obtained by reacting 2 with thioisocyanate in refluxing EtOAc, followed by cyclization in the presence of base. Benzylation and chlorination afforded compounds 4 and 5. The C4-chloro group was then displaced with cyclopropylamine to provide compound 6. Sulfone derivative 7 was obtained by treatment of 6 with 2.5 equivalents of mCPBA, which was then substituted with benzene-1,3-diamine in acetic acid to give 8. A mixture of imine and ester was initially obtained when 8 was

treated with HCl gas in methanol at room temperature overnight. However, after brief reflux in methanol, the methyl ester 9 was the only product isolated. The ester was then saponified. The intra-molecular cyclization was readily achieved by treatment with the coupling reTable 1. Cell activity of macrocyclic pyrazolotriazines

agent, HATU, in the presence of base in NMP to provide macrocyclic pyrazolotriazine 10. ° The 2.0 A co-crystal structure of compound 10 in complex with cCK2a revealed that the alkyl linker of the macrocyclic derivative fits quite elegantly into the hydrophobic cavity at the back of the deep pocket, making all the hydrophobic interactions with protein as predicted by modeling. The amide group still made two hydrogen bonds with the salt bridge of cCK2a (Asp175 and Lys68) without interruption by the four carbon chain linkage (Fig. 3). MTT cell based assay13 demonstrated that compound 10 was about 10-fold more potent than compound 1, even though it lost 100-fold enzyme inhibitory potency (Fig. 1). Clearly, the significantly improved cellular activity of 10 is most likely the result of enhanced membrane permeability imparted by the less planar, more three-dimensional structure imparted by the macrocyclic lactam ring system. Encouraged by the improvement of cellular activity, a series of macrocyclic pyrazolotriazine derivatives (Table 1) was designed and synthesized. Based on the available co-crystal structures, meta-position of the aniline points to the solvent exposed region. Therefore, incorporation of meta-amide groups might enhance their enzyme inhibitory potency and increase solubility. Preparation of this series of compounds is illustrated in Scheme 2. Compound 11 was obtained by following a similar procedure as described in Scheme 1. The nitrile group was then converted to the ester. Upon saponification, the di-acid compound 13 was obtained. The cyclization and amide formation were carried out in a

one-pot two-coupling procedure, in which 1.5 equivalents of coupling reagent HATU was added in a dilute solution of 13 to form the macrocyclic system followed by additional 1.0 equivalent of HATU and excess of corresponding amines to give desired compounds 14. Bioassays clearly demonstrated that replacing the C4cyclopropyl group with a substituted phenyl group regained enzyme inhibitory potency. At the meantime, the substituent groups of the meta-amide greatly increased the aqueous solubility, which, in turn, greatly enhanced cellular activity of these macrocyclic pyrazolotriazines against both human prostate (PC3) and colon cancer (HCT116) cell lines (Table 1). In summary, we have described the design and synthesis of a novel class of macrocyclic pyrazolo[1,5-a] [1,3,5]triazines as potent CK2 protein kinase inhibitors. These compounds strongly inhibit cell growth in vitro in both human prostate and colon cancer cell lines. Compounds with potent CK2 and cancer cell inhibitory activity are currently being evaluated in animal xenograft models for their anti-tumor activities in vivo. References and notes
