A series of triazepane derivatives such as (R)-3-amino-1-(1,2,5-triazepan-1-yl)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-1-ones (7, 13a­p) and (R)-3-amino-1-(1,2,5-triazepan-5-yl)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan1-ones (17a­e) was synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme. Compounds with the acid moiety were found to be potent inhibitors of DPP-IV without inhibiting CYP 3A4. Among them, compound 13p ((R)-4-[1-acetyl-2-{3-amino-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoyl-1,2,5-triazepan-5-carbonyl}benzoic acid]) showed a good in vitro activity without inhibiting CYP. ß 2009 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Diabetes mellitus (type 2) is a non-insulin dependent disease caused by chronic hyperglycemia, and considered under multiple metabolic disorders. It is commonly observed in patients with inadequate insulin secretion, insulin resistance, hepatic glucose overproduction or glucose intolerance [1]. Incretin, a glucagon-like peptide hormone (GLP-1) [2,3] is released from L cells of the small intestine in response to the digestion of food, and plays an important role in insulin secretion. Increased activity of incretin will lead to sustained insulin secretion, which regulates the glucose level in the body. It also controls gastric emptying, induction of satiety as well as regeneration and differentiation of islet b-cells [4,5]. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a serine protease present in many tissues and body fluids, existing either in the membrane bound or soluble enzyme form, degrades GLP-1 (GLP-1[7­36]amide) into inactive GLP[9­ 36]amide [6­8] at the N-terminus position. Inhibition of DPP-IV increases the concentration of GLP-1 and, as a result, increases insulin secretion [9­11], which can ameliorate hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. It is known that fluorine or trifluoromethyl [12,13] group at an appropriate position in the molecule alters the chemical and

biological properties of the molecule. The fluorine substitution is extensively practiced in the design of potential molecules and therefore there is a growing demand for the synthesis of fluorinated molecules. Recently, several studies have emerged on the use of fluorinated molecules [14­20] as DPP-IV inhibitors, some of which are in advanced stage of development. Among them, MK-0431 (Sitagliptin, launched in the market by Merck) is a representative fluorinated DPP-IV inhibitor and its 2,4,5-trifluorophenyl moiety occupy the active pocket of DPP-IV [14]. We have been working on finding new molecules which can selectively inhibit DPP-IV without inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which play a major role in metabolizing drug molecules. Many lead candidate molecules in pharmaceutical development fail due to inhibition of one or more isozyme forms of CYP enzymes. CYP 3A4, is one of the most important cytochrome P450s present in human liver [21] has ability to metabolize >50% of administered therapeutic agents. It accounts for the large number of documented drug­drug interactions associated with CYP 3A4 inhibition [22­24]. Our continued efforts [25­27] towards finding a potential dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor, we designed triazepane derivatives having (R)-3-amino-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoyl moiety which was conceived from MK-0431. Thus, we wish to report here the synthesis of triazepane derivatives and biological evaluation for their ability to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) without inhibiting CYP. MK-0431 was used as a reference. The basic skeletons are outlined below.

2. Results and discussion 2.1. Synthesis The triazepane derivatives 7 and 13 were synthesized according to Scheme 1. Bis(2-chloroethyl)amine 1 was initially protected with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of a base, and coupled with di-tert-butyl hydrazine-1,2-dicarboxylate to yield cyclic triazepane 3. Two strategies were adopted for selective deprotection of compound 3. One strategy was Boc deprotection using 4 M HCl and another was Cbz deprotection using 10% palladium on carbon under hydrogen atmosphere to obtain compounds 4 and 8, respectively. Compound 4 was

further coupled with (R)-3-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-4(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid in the presence of EDCI to give compound 5. Compound 5 was then reduced using 10% palladium on carbon under hydrogen atmosphere to yield compound 6, followed by Boc deprotection with 4 M HCl to obtain compound 7. Also, compound 5 was deprotected or further derivatized by acylating reagents to give compound 13. Alternatively, compound 8 was reacted with various electrophiles, then Boc deprotection, followed by reaction with (R)-3[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid to give compound 11 through compounds 9 and 10. Compound 11 was further converted to final compounds 13 via compound 12 or directly.

The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on FT-NMR Varian GEMINI-200FT or Bruker AVANCE-300 and TMS as an internal reference. ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded on Travel IR (Sens IR Technology) spectrophotometer. Low-resolution mass spectra were obtained on the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS, Waters). High-resolution mass spectra were obtained on the Autospec magnetic sector mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). 4.1.1. Preparation of benzyl bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamate (2) To a solution of bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine HCl 1 (4.5 g, 25.2 mmol) in acetone/H2O (100 mL, 1:1), were added Na2CO3 (8.9 g, 84.0 mmol) and benzyl chloroformate (4.7 mL, 33.6 mmol) at 0 8C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Acetone was removed under vacuum, and aqueous residue was extracted with ethyl acetate. Organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane: 1/9) to give compound 2 (5.3 g, 61%, colorless oil) 1 H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): d 7.36­7.35 (m, 5H), 5.15 (s, 2H), 3.69­ 3.65 (m, 4H), 3.61­3.55 (m, 4H); LC-MS: m/z 276 (MH+). 4.1.2.

The mixture was stirred for 13 h under reflux condition, cooled to room temperature, and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane: 1/1) to give compound 3 (4.0 g, 51%, colorless oil). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz): d 7.36­7.34 (m, 5H), 5.14 (s, 2H), 4.21­4.02 (m, 2H), 3.98­3.65 (m, 1H), 3.52­3.04 (m, 5H), 1.49 (s, 18H); LC-MS: m/z 436 (MH+); IR 2975, 2932, 1692, 1721. 4.1.3. Preparation of benzyl-1,2,5-triazepane-5-carboxylateÁ2HCl (4) To a solution of 5-benzyl-1,2-di-tert-butyl-1,2,5-triazepane1,2,5-tricarboxylate 3 (1.3 g, 2.99 mmol) in ethyl acetate (5 mL), was added 4M-HCl/1,4-dioxane (5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at room temperature, and then the solvents were evaporated. The residue was crystallized with ether to give compound 4 (400 mg, 43%, white solid). m.p. 91­94 8C; 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 300 MHz): d 7.37 (m, 5H), 5.09 (s, 2H), 4.20­3.00 (m, 8H); LC-MS: m/z 236 (MH+); IR 2974, 2931, 1691. 4.1.4. Preparation of (R)-benzyl-1-(3-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-4(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoyl)-1,2,5-triazepane-5-carboxylate (5) To a solution of (R)-3-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-4-(2,4,5trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid (333 mg, 1.00 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL), were added 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI, 552 mg, 1.92 mmol), TEA (1.39 mL, 10 mmol) and 5-benzyl-1,2,5-triazepane-5-carboxylateÁ2HCl 4 (369 mg, 1.20 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Organic layer was extracted from H2O/ CH2Cl2 and washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane: 2/1) to obtain compound 5 (440 mg, 80%, colorless oil). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz): d 7.35­7.32 (m, 5H), 7.12­6.99 (m, 1H), 6.88­6.81 (m, 1H), 5.48­5.32 (br, 1H), 5.12 (s,

The IC50 values were determined from a direct regression curve analysis.

Similarly, triazepane derivatives 17 were synthesized as shown in Scheme 2. Thus, compound 4 was acylated with various acylating reagents to afford compound 14, and on Cbz deprotection gave compound 15 followed by coupling with (R)-3-[(tertbutoxycarbonyl)amino]-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid resulted compound 16. Alternatively, compound 16a was prepared starting from compound 8 through coupling with (R)-3-[(tertbutoxycarbonyl)amino]-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid followed by Boc deprotection yielded compound 17. 2.2. In vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity The 1-[3-amino-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoyl]triazepane derivatives (7 and 13a­l) were evaluated in vitro for their DPP-IV inhibition and the results are summarized in Table 1. MK0431 was used as a reference compound. The basic compound (7, Ra = Rb = H) showed weak inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 9.8 mM. Introduction of the benzyloxycarbonyl group at the Rb position resulted in improved potency (13a, Ra = H, Rb = Cbz, IC50 = 859 nM). Furthermore, acetyl derivative at the Ra position (13b, Ra = CH3CO, Rb = Cbz) showed better inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 578 nM. Whereas the benzoyl substituent (13c, Ra = C6H5CO, Rb = Cbz) reduced the activity. The 5-pyrazine, 5-methyl acetate and 2-acetyl-5-methanesulfonyl derivatives showed micromolar range potencies (13d, e, h). However, the 5-trifluoroacetyl, 5methanesulfonyl and 2,5-disubstituted derivatives showed better potencies (13f, g, i­l) with the IC50 values in the 151­700 nM range. Among all of the derivatives, compound 13l (Ra = 2-(thiazolo[5,4b]pyridine-2-ylthio)acetyl, Rb = CH3SO2) demonstrated the highest in vitro activity, with an IC50 value of 151 nM. The 5-[3-amino-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoyl]triazepane derivatives (17a­e) also were evaluated in vitro, and the results are summarized in Table 2. The basic triazepane derivative 17a (Ra = Rb = H) showed a weak inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 4.5 mM and the introduction of substituents for Ra and Rb (17b­e) resulted an improved activity with the IC50 values in the 853­ 3300 nM range. Based on the inhibitory activity data of the above two series of compounds, compound 13 derivatives were found to be promising, and therefore we further derivatized to find more potent compounds. Thus, a new set of triazepane derivatives was synthesized, evaluated for their inhibitory activity and CYP inhibition. Compounds with an acid moiety were found to exhibit good DPP-IV inhibitory activity without inhibiting CYP as shown in Table 3. The compound 13p showed promising in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 98 nM without CYP 3A4 inhibition at 10 mM concentration. We also examined the selectivity toward DPP-IV-related enzymes such as DPP-2 and DPP-8 (Table 4). Compound 13p displayed at least 300-fold better selectivity toward DPP-IV related enzymes. 3. Conclusion A series of triazepane derivatives (7, 13a­p and 17a­e) was synthesized, and evaluated their ability to inhibit the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Compound 13p showed a good in vitro activity, selectivity without CYP inhibition. Further studies are underway to optimize this compound class for use in the treatment of diabetes.

DPP-IV in vitro activity 10 mL of Caco-2 cell lysate was suspended in Tris­HCl (pH 7.5) and 40 mM Ala-Pro-AFC (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) was added. After treatment of compounds, the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 24 8C. AFC as a indicator of DPP-IV activity was detected at 405 nm/ 510 nm (Ex/Em) by Fluorometer, Synergy HT (Biotek). IC50 was calculated by Prism 4.0 software (GarphPad Software, Inc.). 4.5. CYP assay The CYP 3A4 enzyme assay was carried out using fluorometric enzyme assays with Vivid CYP 3A4 assay kit (PanVera, USA, CA), in a 96-well microtiter plate following the manufacturer's instruction with some modification. Test compounds including the ketoconazole is known as CYP 3A4 inhibitor was prepared in acetonitrile to give final concentrations of 10 mM. Briefly, to each well of the microtiter plate was added NADP generating solution (1.0 mM NADP+, 3.3 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 3.3 mM MgCl2Á6H2O, and 0.4 U/mL glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 10 mM K3PO4, pH 8.0) followed by the vehicle acetonitrile (control) and the test samples. The plate was covered and then incubated at 37 8C for 20 min. Enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme/ substrate (E/S) mixture (0.5 pmol CYP 3A4 enzyme and 5 mM dibenzylfluorescein, DBF). The plate was further incubated for 20 min, followed by the addition of the stop solution to terminate the enzyme activity. Background reading was measured in a similar manner except for the E/S mixture which was added after the enzyme reaction was terminated. The fluorescence of DBF metabolite fluorescein was measured on a fluorescence plate

reader with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The effect of test compounds on CYP 3A4 enzyme was calculated as the percentage of the enzyme activity.
