Background: Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4 utilizes a multicomponent enzyme system to oxidize naphthalene to (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2dihydronaphthalene. The enzyme component catalyzing this reaction, naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (NDO), belongs to a family of aromatic-ringhydroxylating dioxygenases that oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons and related compounds to cis-arene diols. These enzymes utilize a mononuclear non-heme iron center to catalyze the addition of dioxygen to their respective substrates. The present study was conducted to provide essential structural information necessary for elucidating the mechanism of action of NDO. Results: The three-dimensional structure of NDO has been determined at 2.25 Å resolution. The molecule is an 33 hexamer. The  subunit has a -sheet domain that contains a Rieske [2Fe­2S] center and a catalytic domain that has a novel fold dominated by an antiparallel nine-stranded -pleated sheet against which helices pack. The active site contains a non-heme ferrous ion coordinated by His208, His213, Asp362 (bidentate) and a water molecule. Asn201 is positioned further away, 3.75 Å, at the missing axial position of an octahedron. In the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center, one iron is coordinated by Cys81 and Cys101 and the other by His83 and His104. Conclusions: The domain structure and iron coordination of the Rieske domain is very similar to that of the cytochrome bc1 domain. The active-site iron center of one of the  subunits is directly connected by hydrogen bonds through a single amino acid, Asp205, to the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center in a neighboring  subunit. This is likely to be the main route for electron transfer.

Introduction
Interest in the structure and mechanism of action of aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase systems [1] stems from two sources. First, they play an important role in providing the basic knowledge necessary for the development of bioremediation technology. Second, they often produce single enantiomers of cis-arene diols which have been used as chiral synthons in the formation of inositols, prostaglandin E2, conduritols, and numerous products with biological activity [2­6]. Thus, they may provide an additional, and potentially environmentally benign, alternative to the use of chemical catalysts in asymmetric hydroxylation reactions [7]. One commercial application [8] is the oxidation of indole to indigo by the naphthalene dioxygenase system [9,10] in a reaction that does not generate waste products. A large family of more than 40 related multicomponent mononuclear non-heme iron oxygenase systems has been identified by protein purification or sequence analysis [1,11]. The naphthalene dioxygenase system from Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4 is characterized by the extensive range of

substrates it can oxidize and the different types of reactions catalyzed with different substrates [6]. For example, naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (E.C. 1.14.12.12), the catalytic component, catalyzes the reaction shown below, and also catalyzes many of the reactions reported for cytochrome P450 [12]. Naphthalene + NAD(P)H + H + + O 2  (+)-cis-(1R,2S)dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene + NAD(P)+ The naphthalene dioxygenase system utilizes an iron­ sulfur flavoprotein to transfer electrons from NAD(P)H to a Rieske [2Fe­2S] ferredoxin which in turn reduces the terminal oxygenase [13,14]. This catalytic portion of the naphthalene dioxygenase system which we here call NDO (earlier called ISPNAP for iron­sulfur protein) is composed of non-identical subunits,  and  [15]. This change in nomenclature is in accordance with the more recent classification of iron­sulfur proteins by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology [16]. The presence of a Rieske [2Fe­2S] center and mononuclear iron in the  subunit of NDO

[15,17,18] and all other aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases is based on biophysical studies with phthalate [19­21] and benzene [22,23] dioxygenases and deduced amino acid sequence data [11,24]. NDO was shown to contain ferrous iron as indicated by the identification of a Fe2+­nitric oxide complex by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (MD Wolfe, JD Lipscomb, KL and DTG, unpublished data). The  subunit (present in some members of the family) has no cofactors and its role in catalysis is unknown. The genes encoding the individual components of NDO have been cloned and sequenced [25,26]. An overproducing recombinant Escherichia coli strain has been used to purify large amounts of active NDO; this facilitated crystallization of the enzyme [27]. We now describe the three-dimensional structure of NDO. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure of an asymmetric aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase and can serve as the prototype structure for this unique group of enzymes. We find that the quaternary organization of the enzyme allows a close contact between the two redox centers. The Rieske [2Fe­2S] center of one  subunit in the 33 molecule is positioned in close proximity to the mononuclear iron at the active site of a neighboring  subunit, suggesting a functional cooperativity between  subunits.

noncrystallographic symmetry-related units was restrained throughout the refinement. An omit map around the active site shows the quality of the electron density (Figure 1). The quality of the present model is good and more than 90% of the residues are in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot [28]. There are only two residues in the disallowed region (Cys309 in the  subunit and His188 in the  subunit), but inspection of both residues reveals that they are in regions of good electron density. Both of these buried residues are stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds.
Quaternary structure

Results and discussion
The NDO structure was solved in a trigonal crystal form by a combination of the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) methods using selenomethionine (SeMet) labeled protein. The structure has been refined at 2.5 Å resolution. During refinement, a new orthorhombic crystal form was found that diffracted to 2.25 Å resolution. This crystal form was used for the final refinement, giving an R factor of 0.19 and an R free of 0.23. The geometry of the three
Figure 1

NDO and most of the dioxygenases of this family of enzymes have been characterized as 22 or 33 multimers [29]. A third group consists of oxygenases that only contain  subunits [30] (reviewed in [1]). On the basis of gel-filtration analysis, NDO was originally reported to have an 22 subunit composition [15]. From the crystal structure, it is apparent that NDO is an 33 hexamer (Figures 2a and b). This is supported by recent analytical ultracentrifugation analysis, which gave a molecular mass of 210 kDa for NDO (KL and DTG, unpublished data). The arrangement of the redox centers also strongly supports an 33 quaternary structure (see below). The residues involved in the contacts between the  subunits are to a large extent conserved within the sequences of the  family of ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, suggesting that hexamers may be the common organization. The overall shape of the full hexameric complex resembles that of a mushroom (Figure 2a), in which the stem consists of the 3 subunits and the cap the 3 subunits. The height of the mushroom is 75 Å and the diameters of the cap and stem are 102 Å and 50 Å, respectively. The trimer of heterodimers forms a very compact quaternary structure, with three completely separated active

sites but with the redox centers from different subunits connected across the subunit borders (Figure 2). The three  and  subunits form tight trimers which bury a large part of their accessible surface area. Upon trimerization, 18,022 Å2 of solvent-accessible area (as determined using the program SurfVol in WhatCheck) are buried. When the  heterodimer is formed, a total of 4396 Å2 are buried. There are only a few mainchain­ mainchain hydrogen bonds between the  and  subunits. However, there are several sidechain-mediated hydrogen bonds that are not conserved within the family.
The structure of the subunit

Figure 2

The  subunit is dominated by a long twisted six-stranded mixed  sheet (Figure 3a,b). The strand order is 2-1-6-5-4-3. Three of the strands (3, 4 and 5) are 14 residues in length, which is unusually long for such a small protein. On the concave side of the pleated sheet, there are three helices and on the convex side of the sheet is an additional N-terminal helix. The central part of the contact area to the other  subunits in the trimer is formed by the pleated sheet, reminiscent of porin trimers [31]. Most of the helices are on the outside of the trimer and are in contact with other parts of the twisted sheet in other subunits. The N-terminal helix contacts the 2­3 hairpin in another  subunit. Reports in the literature have suggested that the  subunits of toluate, toluene and biphenyl dioxygenases may contribute to substrate specificity [32,33]. However, other studies have indicated that the  subunit alone may control substrate specificity in the benzene, 2-nitrotoluene and 2,4-dinitrotoluene dioxygenase systems ([34]; JV Parales, REP, SM Resnick and DTG, unpublished data). Recent work in our laboratory indicates that the  subunit of NDO does not contribute to the substrate range, regiospecificity or stereospecificity of NDO (REP and DTG, unpublished data). As the  subunit does not appear to be directly involved in catalysis or substrate specificity, its main role is probably structural. The atoms of the  subunit closest to the iron at the active site and the Rieske center are about 10 Å away. The  subunit shows a remarkable three-dimensional similarity to two other functionally unrelated proteins -- scytalone dehydratase (ScDH) [35] and nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) [36] (Figure 3c). Superposition of the three structures gives a root mean square (rms) difference between the  subunit of NDO and ScDH of 1.8 Å for 104 aligned C positions and 1.9 Å for 106 C atoms in common with the NTF2 structure (calculated using the lsq options in O [37]). It is remarkable that these three proteins have such similar structures but completely different functions. ScDH and the NDO  subunits are trimers with the same quaternary structure arrangement, whereas NTF2 exists as a dimer. It has been proposed that ScDH

is derived from an ancestral NTF2 [38] despite the total lack of sequence identity (6­10%).

Structure

A sequence alignment based on structural superposition shows that only three residues are the same in all three structures. Interestingly, Asp46 in the NDO  subunit is equivalent to Asp31 in ScDH, which is in an active-site Asp­His couple that is also conserved in NTF2. In NDO, the residue corresponding to this histidine is Arg118, which forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 193 close to the C terminus. The latter is bound inside the subunit with several hydrogen bonds. In contrast to ScDH, the NDO  subunit does not have an enzymatic function. Instead of forming an active-site cleft as in ScDH, the cone-shaped NDO  subunit is completely filled by the C terminus, which is bent inwards, filling the

center of the cone. The negatively charged C terminus binds to the internal Arg159 and Arg176 residues. The other two residues that are present in all three structures are Ile120, which is involved in hydrophobic interactions, and Lys164, which is on the surface. These residues are, however, not conserved in the  subunits of all  dioxygenases that have been sequenced to date. Thus, their conservation seems to be a coincidence. Compared with ScDH and NTF2, there are two pronounced extensions in the NDO  subunit. The 24 residues at the N terminus are involved in trimer interactions between the  subunits. The long loop formed by residues

68­85 is also involved in  subunit interactions and makes interactions with the Rieske domain of the  subunit as well. Residue 75 forms a mainchain hydrogen bond to the mainchain of residue 92 of the Rieske domain. The  subunit contains the active site mononuclear iron and the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center. The  subunit has 25  strands and 13  helices that have been numbered consecutively. The  subunit can be divided into two distinct domains: a Rieske domain that contains the [2Fe­2S] center and the catalytic domain that contains the non-heme ferrous iron ion (Figure 4).

are due to subunit interactions within the NDO hexamer. The two iron-binding loops in the Rieske center of the cytochrome bc1 fragment are connected to each other by a disulfide bridge that covers one side of the iron center. NDO does not need a stabilizing disulfide bridge because the Rieske center in NDO is completely buried by surrounding  and  subunits. From the structural similarities, it seems highly likely that both Rieske domains stem from an ancestral Rieske protein. An alignment based on the structural superposition shows a sequence identity of 16% for the approximately 100 residues common to both domains. As shown in Figure 5b, the sequence similarities are most pronounced around the metal center. Four of six residues are the same around the first set of ligands while three of five are the same around the second set. The structure of the chloroplast Rieske protein has been published recently [40]. In contrast to the cytochrome bc1 domain, the chloroplast Rieske domain is divided into two distinct subdomains. The subdomain binding the [2Fe­2S] center is virtually identical in the two cases. The rest of the domain shows striking differences despite a common folding topology.
The Rieske [2Fe­2S] center

The Rieske domain (residues 38­158) consists of four separate -sheet structures composed of  strands 3­15 (Figure 4a). Two of the sheets are arranged in a -sandwich topology with 14-15-3 packing against the catalytic domain on one side and against the sheet formed by 13-6-5-4-9 on the other side. Two -hairpin structures protrude roughly perpendicular to this sheet and form two fingers that hold the [2Fe­2S] center at their tips. The first of these fingers is formed by 7 and 8, where 7 makes a 90° turn away from 6 in the previous sheet. The first two iron ligands in the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center are positioned in the loop between 7 and 8. The second of the -sheet fingers is composed of 10-11-12. The second pair of iron ligands to the Rieske center is found in the loop between 10 and 11. The Rieske domain in NDO has a very similar structure to the Rieske domain of a water-soluble fragment of the cytochrome bc1 complex [39]. Superpositioning of the Rieske domains of NDO and cytochrome bc1 results in an rms difference of 1.8 Å for 84 C atoms (using the lsq options in O with standard parameters [37]; Figure 5a). The first and second  sheets are very similar, as is the loop between the iron ligands. Residues 104­128 in cytochrome bc1 are located on one side of the domain far away from the Rieske center. Equivalent residues are not present in NDO. Another major difference between the two Rieske domains is the presence of a long loop of 15 residues (118­132) in NDO. The analogous region in cytochrome bc1 has only three residues (175­177), which are at a similar position as the highly conserved Trp106 in NDO. The sidechain of this residue covers one side of the Rieske center and stacks against the iron ligand His83. Cytochrome bc1 has a proline at the equivalent position. The longer loop in the NDO domain is to a large extent involved in subunit interactions with the catalytic domain in a neighboring subunit. Likewise, residues 89­97 in NDO, which differ significantly from the corresponding residues in cytochrome bc1 (146­154), are also involved in interactions with a  subunit. Thus, the two large differences close to the Rieske center between the two domains

In the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center, Fe1 is coordinated by Cys81 and Cys101 while Fe2 is coordinated by the ND atoms of His83 and His104 (Figure 5c). The two sulfide ions bridge the two iron ions and form a flat rhombic arrangement. There are hydrogen bonds from the mainchain nitrogens of residues 84 and 86 to one of the sulfide ions and from the mainchain nitrogens of residues 104 and 106 to the other sulfide ion. The four iron-liganding sidechains are hydrogen bonded in a second coordination shell. Both histidine ligands are hydrogen bonded to carboxylate residues in a neighboring subunit. Asp205 binds to the NE of His104 and Glu410 binds to the NE of His83. The sulfur atoms of Cys81 and Cys101 are hydrogen bonded to the mainchain nitrogens of residues 83 and 103, respectively. The coordination is consistent with spectroscopic data obtained for enzymes of this dioxygenase family [23,41]. The ligands, iron atoms and sulfide ions in the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center of NDO superimpose closely on the cytochrome bc1 Rieske center structure, which was determined at 1.5 Å resolution [39]. The deviations in coordination geometry are within experimental error (Table 1). In spite of the structural similarities, the redox potentials of the two proteins appear to be different. The mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 Rieske center has a redox potential of +300 mV [42]. The redox potentials for aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases are very different from the one in the cytochrome complex. For

example, the redox potential of benzene dioxygenase is ­112 ± 15 mV [22]. This value was obtained from anaerobic titration of the [2Fe­2S] center and the midpoint potential was not affected by interaction with iron or ferredoxin. In view of their similar structures, as deduced

from the sequence similarities between benzene dioxygenase and NDO, it is not unreasonable to predict that the redox potential for NDO would be in the same range. The redox potential for phthalate dioxygenase is ­150 mV [43].

*Not present in NDO. Asn201 is a potential iron ligand. The distances and angles at the two iron centers are listed for the three  subunits in the asymmetric unit (A, B and C) that were refined with restraints. The values for the Rieske center are compared with the corresponding

parameters for the Rieske centers in the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (PDB code 1rie) [39] and the photosynthetic cytochrome b6f complex [40] (PDB code 1rfs).

There is a difference in the hydrogen bonding for the NDO and cytochrome bc1 Rieske centers. In the latter, one of the cysteine sulfur atoms accepts two hydrogen bonds, whereas each cysteine sulfur in NDO accepts a single hydrogen bond. The histidine ligands in cytochrome bc1 are exposed to the solvent and the bound iron

is close to the surface of the protein. In NDO they are completely buried. This difference has been suggested to be partly responsible for the differences in redox potential [39]. Furthermore, both histidines in the NDO Rieske center are hydrogen bonded to carboxylates, which may influence the redox potential.

The catalytic domain

The catalytic domain is dominated by a nine-stranded antiparallel  sheet that extends over the whole  subunit (Figure 4c). The strand order is, from the top of the `cap', 24-25-17-18-19-20-21-22-16. The sheet has tight connections between strands on the side that packs against the Rieske domain whereas all insertions between the strands are on the other side. Three of the insertions between the strands contains the ligands to the catalytic iron and form the active-site cleft. One side of the active site is formed by the long helix, 10, which is broken into two parts at residues 353­355 that loop out from the helix. The helix covers one part of the sheet in its full length. Asp362, a ligand to the catalytic iron, is positioned a halfturn after the break. The two other structural motifs that form the active site extend like two fingers from different directions and pack against the long broken 10 helix. Between strands 18 and 19 there are two helices (8 and 9) covering one edge of the active site. Between strands 16 and 17, three helices (5, 6 and 7) together with the loop (residues 228­234) form the third part of the active site. This part contains two of the three ligands to the active-site iron, His208 and His213, which are located in helix 6. Asp205, which is probably important for electron transfer (see below), is found on the tight turn between the 5 and 6 helices. The structure of the active site is thus formed by the sheet forming the base with one helix packing against it and with the two other structural elements sticking out from the sheet against this helix. The additional structural elements of the domain form the top part of the mushroom on both sides of the main sheet. The additional small  sheet with three short antiparallel strands is also located in this part of the mushroom cap. While the  subunit and the Rieske domain have similar structural relatives, the structure of the catalytic domain seems to represent a new fold. A structural homology search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI [44] and DEJAVU [45] programs found no protein structures similar to the catalytic domain of NDO.
Coordination of the iron at the active site

then formed by the bidentate coordinating Asp362, the NE atom of His208 and the water molecule. The axial ligands are the NE atom of His213 and the sidechain oxygen of Asn201 at the considerably longer distance. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on toluene dioxygenase (TDO) led to the suggestion that the conserved amino acids Glu200, Asp205, His208 and His213 may serve as ligands to iron at the active site of this enzyme [11]. The loss of TDO activity when Asp219 of TDO (analogous to Asp205 of NDO) is replaced by alanine can be explained by its putative role in electron transfer (see below). Glu200, which was also identified as an essential residue on the basis of site-directed mutational studies of TDO [11], forms contacts between  subunits in NDO and thus may be important for ­ subunit interactions instead of iron coordination as previously proposed. Extensive biophysical studies of the active-site iron of phthalate dioxygenase (PDO) have been carried out [46­48]. The results suggest that the iron exists in a distorted octahedral six-coordinate ferrous complex which changes to one [48] or two [47] five-coordinate species when phthalate binds to the enzyme. The change in coordination state from six to five is attributed to a phthalate binding-dependent conformational change that displaces a labile ligand and provides a site for oxygen binding and activation [46­48]. A change in coordination state can be envisaged for NDO with Asn201 as a labile ligand. However, if this is correct, the coordination change in PDO must involve a different residue from that in NDO. According to our sequence alignment, the residue corresponding to Asn201 appears to be a glycine in PDO. There is precedence for asparagine as an iron ligand in the binuclear di-iron carboxylate enzyme purple acid phosphatase [49]. Asn201 is not completely conserved in the dioxygenase family, but is replaced by a glutamine in many of the enzymes. With slight differences in geometry, a glutamine residue might form a similar coordination with iron as the asparagine. This type of coordination is seen in isopenicillin N synthase, where manganese substituted for the active-site iron is coordinated by two histidines, one aspartate and a glutamine [50]. In the enzyme­ substrate complex, the glutamine sidechain is replaced by the substrate [51]. The coordination of iron at the active site of NDO resembles to some extent that seen in other iron enzymes. The extradiol-cleaving dioxygenases have ferrous iron coordinated by two histidines, one glutamate (monodentate) and two water molecules [52,53]. The same type of coordination has also been found in tyrosine hydroxylase and related enzymes [54]. Lipoxygenases have iron coordinated by three histidines and the C terminus [55].

The iron atom at the active site is coordinated by His208, His213, bidentately by Asp362 and by a water molecule. The geometry can be described as a distorted octahedral bipyramid with one ligand missing (Figure 6a; Table 1). Both histidines are hydrogen bonded to aspartic acid sidechains. His208 is hydrogen bonded to Asp205 and His213 to Asp361. Both aspartic acids in the second coordination shell, as well as the ligands, are completely conserved in this family of enzymes. Asn201 is located close to the free ligand position of an octahedron but this distance is too great (3.75 Å) for this residue to be a ligand. If Asn201 is considered to be a ligand, a distorted octahedral geometry can be formed (Figure 6b; Table 1). The square plane is

Structure

In many iron enzymes that utilize dioxygen, iron is coordinated by residues from distorted helices. Some ligandcontaining helices in ribonucleotide reductase R2 [56,57], methane monooxygenase [58], cytochrome P450 [59], and lipoxygenase-1 [55] are to some extent distorted. Distortion is usually caused by the presence of extra residues forming -type helix turns. This type of distortion has been considered to provide an oxygen pathway or to increase conformational flexibility [56,60]. The situation is quite different in NDO. One of the ligands in NDO, Asp362, is located in a helix that is distorted to a much larger extent than in the enzymes mentioned above. In this helix, some of the residues in the center of the helix (Gly353, Pro354, Ala355 and Gly356) loop out, and the helix then continues with a small tilt angle. The protruding residues in the NDO helix appear to anchor the  subunit to the  subunit. Three regions of the catalytic domain interact with the  subunit. These include the

long broken 10 helix, which contains one of the ligands to the active-site iron, the 16 strand and the 7 helix. Interestingly, the residues that protrude out at the helix break are the main participants in the interactions with the  subunit. It is primarily the C-terminal residues of the  subunit, which are located inside the structure, that form most of these contacts. These interactions do not seem to be particularly important for keeping the enzyme in an active conformation. Mutants lacking the last nine or 24 C-terminal residues of the  subunit showed only slightly impaired activity, while a number of other mutants that seem to affect the packing of the  trimer have a significant negative effect on activity (REP and DTG, unpublished data).
The active site

Iron at the active site is located approximately 15 Å from the surface of the protein. From the surface, a narrow gorge

provides substrates with access to the iron ion (Figure 7). At the upper part of this gorge, two loops (residues 253­265 and 223­240) shield part of the entrance and may act as lids covering the substrate channel. The channel continues past the iron atom. The distance from the bottom of the cleft to the surface of the protein is about 30 Å. The narrowest part of the long channel is located near the active-site iron where the channel is about 5 Å wide. This part of the channel contains the active-site iron and its two histidine ligands, and also Asn201, Phe202 and Phe352. The region of the channel close to the active-site iron is lined primarily by hydrophobic residues, consistent with NDO's preference for hydrophobic substrates [6]. These hydrophobic residues probably position the substrate for the reaction to take place. The pocket below the activesite iron is 7­8 Å wide, and is lined by the iron ligand Asp362, Ile191 (at the bottom of the channel), Pro198, Trp316, Val326, Asn363, Met366, Tyr103 (from a neighboring  subunit) and a conserved salt bridge between Lys314 and Glu359. The residues in the gorge above the active-site iron are Ala206, Val209, Leu217, Val260, Asn297, Leu307 and Trp358. The only polar sidechains in the center of the channel are the ligands to the catalytic iron and Asn201. Glu359 is approximately 7 Å from the activesite iron. The residues lining this plausible substrate cleft are not conserved in other dioxygenase family members. This is not unexpected, as the substrate specificities of the different members of the family vary.
Electron transfer between the Rieske center and the iron at the active site

Figure 7

Surface plot of NDO. A long narrow gorge leads from the surface of the catalytic domain to the iron at the active site (red). The probable substrate-binding site is the dark region at the bottom of the cleft.

The distance between the Rieske center and the iron at the active site within a single  subunit is 43.5 Å. However, the distance is considerably shorter, 12 Å, between the Rieske center of one  subunit and the active-site iron in a neighboring  subunit in the hexamer (see Figure 2). This is consistent with an estimated minimum separation of approximately 10 Å between the Rieske and mononuclear iron centers for phthalate dioxygenase [46]. The two centers in the symmetry-related NDO  subunits are connected through hydrogen bonds to Asp205. This residue binds to His208, a ligand to the active-site iron, and to His104, a ligand to the Rieske center in a neighboring  subunit (Figure 8). This is in all probability the main electron-transfer pathway. The importance of Asp205 was realized earlier in a site-directed mutational study of TDO where the aspartate corresponding to Asp205 was changed to alanine and the enzyme lost all activity [11]. However, the structure of NDO suggests that this residue is not an iron ligand but may be involved in electron transfer. There are also other hydrogen bonds between the two subunits in the neighborhood of the iron centers. The sidechain of Trp106 and the mainchain carbonyl of residue 117

of the Rieske domain form hydrogen bonds to Tyr207 close to the active site. Another connection between subunits in this area is the charged hydrogen bond between the sidechains of Arg84 of the Rieske domain and Glu200 of the catalytic domain. All of these residues are conserved in all members of the  dioxygenase family. Tyr103 of the Rieske domain and Asn201 form hydrogen bonds between subunits. These are not completely conserved residues.
Possible binding site for ferredoxin and the electrontransfer pathway to the Rieske center

There is a pronounced depression in the Rieske domain close to the [2Fe­2S] center that seems to be well suited for interactions with the ferredoxin component of the NDO system. The depression is formed by residues Lys97, Gly98, Val100, Gln115 and Ser116 from the Rieske domain, Pro118 and Trp211 from the catalytic domain and residues Ser75, Arg77, Arg 78, Pro105 and Trp108 from the  subunit. The arginine residues are located at the outer rim of the depression. The mainchain atoms of the residues of the Rieske domain, and in particular the mainchain atoms of Cys101, are closest to the iron center. The electrons are probably transferred via these mainchain atoms to the Rieske center.
Substrate hydroxylation

The reaction mechanism of NDO is not known. The dioxygenase reaction catalyzed by NDO is stereospecific,

which requires the substrate to be bound close to and fixed in a specific position relative to the iron-bound activated dioxygen species during catalysis. The cis stereospecificity implies that both oxygen atoms are added to the ring from the same side. It is possible that the C1­C2 of the substrate and the activated dioxygen line up parallel to each other. The iron in the active enzyme is believed to be in the ferrous state but the oxidation state of the iron in the crystals has not been determined. Dioxygen can bind to the ferrous ion and can be activated by accepting one electron from iron. The reactive species can then be a superoxide radical like species or a peroxide. Cleavage of the dioxygen molecule may result in ferryl intermediates as in other iron enzymes [51]. Whether proximity of the positively charged iron can polarize the inert substrate remains to be shown. The hydroxylation reaction requires a total input of two electrons. They can be transferred from the Rieske center to the active-site iron during the reaction, but at which step of the reaction this happens is not yet known. Investigations of the reduced form of the Rieske center have shown that the iron atom that is bound by two histidines is reduced to a ferrous ion [41]. An active site ferrous ion can be regenerated for the next activity cycle by electron transfer from ferredoxin via the Rieske center. The active enzyme may hence be considered as one where the catalytic iron is in the ferrous state and the Rieske center is also reduced. There are no residues at

the active site that can facilitate proton donation, so it is likely that the protons come from water.

Biological implications
Naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (NDO) belongs to a family of bacterial enzymes that have an essential role in the recycling of carbon in nature. These enzymes are especially important in the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons and related environmental pollutants. Knowledge of the NDO reaction mechanism is thus important in the development of bioremediation strategies for cleaning up environments contaminated with hazardous aromatic compounds. An attractive alternative to bioremediation is the application of `green chemistry', which refers to the production of industrial chemicals by processes that do not generate hazardous waste. For example, a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli expressing NDO, has been used to synthesize indigo dye from glucose. cisArene diols produced by NDO and toluene dioxygenase have been used in the synthesis of many products of biological and economic importance. The structure of NDO is the prototype for all members of the family of aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases. The enzyme exists as a mushroom-shaped 33 hexamer. The  subunit contains a Rieske [2Fe­2S] center that transfers electrons to mononuclear iron at the active site of the enzyme. The structure of the domain containing the Rieske center is strikingly similar to that of the soluble

fragment of the Rieske [2Fe­2S] protein from the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex. This observation suggests that both Rieske [2Fe­2S] domains may be derived from a common ancestral iron­sulfur protein. The structure of the catalytic domain is characterized by a novel domain fold that is dominated by a nine-stranded  sheet. The structure suggests cooperativity between adjacent  subunits, where electrons from the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center in one  subunit are transferred to mononuclear iron at the active site in the adjacent  subunit. The active site is located at the bottom of a narrow channel where mononuclear iron is coordinated by two histidines and one aspartate residue. The smaller  subunit does not contain any cofactors and may have a structural role in the holoenzyme.

0.97859 Å, and at the the remote wavelength, 0.90500 Å until a full 60° data set had been collected.The EXAFS spectrum was used to choose the wavelengths used in data collection [27]. The anomalous differences varied between the different batches of the MAD data set. Therefore, each of the four batches were introduced individually in SHARP as incomplete data sets. It was absolutely crucial to divide the batches. If all data were processed as one set, the anomalous signal vanished and the resulting map was of bad quality. In spite of the large content of the asymmetric unit (1286 residues), the contribution by 20 Se atoms (only 20 of the 26 Se atoms refined well using only the MAD data) gave excellent phases and a beautiful 3.5 Å map was calculated based on MAD experimental phases (combined with the Hendrickson­Lattmann coefficients input as external phase information to SHARP from the EMTS derivatives and the home Se data used as a derivative) and solvent flipping. Crystallographic details are given in Table 2. The electron density of the  strands seen in previous maps was improved and the map contained many additional features. Connectivity between secondary structure elements began to appear. At an early stage a huge peak (7) in the Fourier map was found which was interpreted as the [2Fe­2S] redox center. The coordinates for the iron ligands and the Rieske [2Fe­2S] center from cytochrome bc1 [39] could be modeled into the electron-density map and this was the starting point for tracing the sequence. The phases were slowly extended to 3.0 Å using SOLOMON and most sidechains became visible. With the help of the SeMet positions the sequence could easily be traced. At this stage, all residues were built except a loop between residues 225­235, four residues at the C terminus of the  subunit and the Nterminal methionine in the  subunit. All map and data manipulations were done using the programs mapman and dataman [66].

Materials and methods
Structure determination and refinement of crystal form 1
NDO was purified and crystallized as described [27]. The crystals belong to the rhombohedral space group R32 with cell dimensions a = b = 178.9 Å, c = 323.6 Å (in the hexagonal setting). The crystals grew in 0.5 M sodium sulfate, 0.1 M Mes, pH 5.8, 5 mM nickel(II)sulfate and 22 mM 1,6-hexanediol in a cold room (6° C). Nickel was essential to generate crystal form 1. The crystals grew in three days to a full size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm as half or whole hexagonal plates. The crystals contained two  dimers per asymmetric unit. Their relationship is equivalent to a translation of approximately 1/2 in the z-direction as seen in a native Patterson map (the peak is about 45% the size of the origin peak).

Structure refinement
The structure was refined using the beta test version of the program CNS ([67] and AT Brünger, personal communication). The structure consists of two  dimers noncrystallographically (NCS) related by a translation of about 0.5 in c. Electron density for one of the NCS units was much better than density for the other. This has been observed in other structures [68]. This can be attributed to either static or dynamic disorder of one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit. The reason for this was obvious once the structure was fully determined. The number of packing interactions of the hexamer formed by this NCS unit was very low. Refinement started therefore by first model building the good NCS unit and then generating the other and this process was repeated at all stages of model building. We started refinement with positional NCS restraints in CNS, and did several rounds of torsion angle dynamics [69­72]. A maximum likelihood target using amplitudes and phase probability distribution was used for refinement [73,74]. The final refinement was done using a 2.5 Å data set collected at BM14, at ESRF, Grenoble. The final R factor was 29.2% (for 49,712 reflections between 20 and 2.5 Å and for reflections with Fobs > 3 × (Fobs)) and R free 33.3% (2654 reflections). Bulk-solvent correction was applied as implemented in CNS. Only 16 residues of the surface regions were not in good density. At this point, there were 485 water molecules in every NCS unit. The geometry and the electron density of one of the NCS units was good.

Data collection
The data were collected on crystals frozen in 25­30% ethylene glycol under cryogenic conditions (100K). DENZO and SCALEPACK [61] were used to index and merge each individual data set. Native data sets collected from different crystals proved to be non-isomorphous. The two best native data sets had a difference on F values of 23.1% in spite of small differences in cell dimensions.

Heavy-atom derivatives
For each derivative, the most similar native data sets were used. The EMTS derivative gave interpretable Patterson maps and minor sites were found from difference Fourier maps. The phases from this derivative were used to locate sites in the other derivatives. Pt and Ta derivatives were investigated but hardly improved the phasing. Derivative data were paired with the most isomorphous native data and refined using MLPHARE [62]. The phase probabilities for the different data sets were then combined using SIGMAA [63] which increased the quality of the electron density map. Refinement of heavy-atom sites in SHARP [64] together with solvent flipping in SOLOMON [65] improved the map further and  strands were seen in the bones representation. From this map, the relationship between the two non-crystallographically related molecules was confirmed.

MAD
The structure of NDO was determined using a selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted enzyme using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method (MAD). The SeMet-derivatized protein was generated as described [27]. To produce large enough crystals, the pH was raised to 6.0 and the temperature to 8°C. Otherwise, the same conditions were used as for the native crystals. A data set was collected on a rotating anode with a RAXIS-II imaging plate detector. Using the available heavy-atom phases, 26 of the 30 Se sites in the asymmetric unit were found after several consecutive rounds of phase refinement. MAD data were collected on BM14 at ESRF in Grenoble in 15° batches at the peak wavelength, 0.97828 Å, at the inflection point,

Structure determination and refinement of crystal form 2
NDO was purified as described [27]. It was crystallized by the hanging drop method. The 4 µl drop was made of 2 µl of protein (40 mg/ml) and 2 µl of the reservoir solution. The precipitant solution was 2.31 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 Mes pH 6.0 and 2% PEG. The crystals of form 2 were rectangular rods belonging to the orthorhombic space group I222 with cell dimensions a = 105.0 0Å, b = 174.0 Å, c = 282.5 Å. The cell volume suggested that there are three  dimers in the asymmetric unit.

Data collection
Data were collected on the crystals frozen in 30% glycerol under cryogenic conditions (100 K) at 0.95 Å wavelength. DENZO and SCALEPACK [61] were used to process and scale data. The crystals

Data from crystal form 2 is reported as it is the higher-resolution structure.

Structure solution
The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE [75]. The search model was the  subunit and the  subunit from the good NCS unit of the refined crystal form 1. The structure was solved easily and the program found three  and three  subunits in the asymmetric unit. The starting correlation factor was 0.70 and the R factor 0.314, suggesting that the solution was correct. It was immediately noticed that there was an 33 hexamer in the asymmetric unit.

Structure refinement
The structure was refined using the maximum likelihood program REFMAC [76], in combination with ARP [77], which was used to add waters automatically. The iron centers were refined without any restraints. The van der Waals radii of these hetero atoms were set to very small values. One round of refinement consisted of 10 cycles of REFMAC (after each cycle of REFMAC, waters were added and deleted automatically using ARP) with threefold NCS restraints, followed by model building using O and OOPS [37,45]. Averaged density modified maps [78] revealed the missing loops and a few other missing residues from form 1. These were added and further refinement continued as described above. All amino acid residues except the C-terminal residue of the  subunit and the N-terminal residue of the  subunit were visible in the electron-density map and have been modeled. Each dimer contained 512 water molecules. The R factor and R free are 19.4% (for 110,479 reflections between 30 and 2.2 Å resolution) and 23.8% (5868 reflections) respectively. Bulk-solvent correction was applied as implemented in the program REFMAC. Restrained individual isotropic B factors were refined. Validation of the structure was done using the programs Procheck [79] and WhatIF (Vriend), using the validation server at EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany. Engh and Huber parameters were used for refinement. The rms deviations in bond lengths and bond angles are 0.02 Å and 2.1°, respectively. The overall coordinate ESU (estimated standard uncertainty) [76] based on R free is 0.2 (ESU based on maximum likelihood is 0.13). These validations show that the structure is of high quality. None of the distances or angles changed significantly between crystal
