In Part 1 of this Letter we described a new class of benzothiophene inhibitors of mitogen activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2). While these compounds were potent inhibitors of MK2 with sub-micromolar cellular potencies, selectivity against other kinases, including CDK2, was not achieved. In this Letter, strategies used to improve the selectivity of this class of inhibitors are described. Previously we had disclosed that placing a rigid group near the hinge binding element resulted in remarkable selectivity enhancement for a different chemical class of MK2 inhibitors.1 For example, compound 1 was found to possess good selectivity against a number of kinases, and this selectivity was attributed to the rigid aryl group attached to the 2-position of the pyridine. Based on this precedent, we sought to modify the hinge binding element in the benzothiophene class (e.g., 2) to provide an attachment point for this selectivity element as shown in 3. To assess this hypothesis, compounds were prepared with an additional ring fused to the benzothiophene ring, which would provide a rigid attachment point for a selectivity element. To verify that the hetero atom, as part of an additional fused ring, could be an effective hinge-binding element, compounds without the selectivity element were first prepared (Fig. 1). The synthesis of furan and dihydro­furan analogs is shown in Scheme 1. Chlorobenzothiophene 42 was demethylated with BBr3 and alkylated with allyl bromide to provide 5. Heating 5 to 200 °C in diethylaniline regioselectively provided 6 in quantitative

yield. Treatment of 6 with OsO4/NaIO4 gave a tautomeric mixture of 7 and 8. This mixture was converted to furan 9 by dehydration in phosphoric acid. Dihydrofuran 10 was prepared by sodium borohydride reduction, mesylate formation of the resulting primary alcohol and cyclization with sodium bicarbonate. Chlorobenzothiophenes 9 and 10 were then elaborated as described in Part 1 of this series by Buchwald coupling with 11, followed by deprotection and cyclization to afford diazapenes 12 and 13.

The synthesis of an analog with a pyridine-containing binding element is shown in Scheme 2. Nitroquinoline 14 was treated with ethyl cyanoacetate and KOH in DMF to provide aminocyanoquinoline 15.3 The amino group was converted to bromide via diazotization to provide 16. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution on the resulting bromide with methyl thioglycolate and subsequent thiophene formation produced 17. Conversion of the amino group in 17 to bromide 18 was accomplished by diazotization and substitution. The resulting bromide was then elaborated as described for 9 and 10 to produce diazapene 19. The potencies of the analogs prepared in Schemes 1 and 2 for MK2, CDK2 and TNFa production in LPS-stimulated U937 cells are reported in Table 1. All three hinge binding replacements are potent MK2 and CDK2 inhibitors. Furan analog 12 and pyridine analog 19 in particular were found to be exceptionally potent inhibitors of MK2 and had IC50 values of less than 100 nM in the cell assay. Broad panel kinase selectivity screening of 12 was conducted. Potencies for a total of 109 kinases were evaluated at 1 lM concentration and 26 kinases (24%) showed >70% inhibition. In an attempt to improve the selectivity of these inhibitors for MK2, compounds with aromatic substituents in the 2-position

were prepared. The synthesis of these analogs is shown in Scheme 3. Propargyl alcohol (20) was converted to allyl bromide 21 and was used in the alkylation as described previously in the conversion of 4 to 5. The remaining sequence of rearrangement, oxidative cleavage of the alkene and dehydration produced 24. Analog 19 was doubly protected with boc groups and the pyridine oxidized to form 25. Reaction with oxalyl chloride and removal of the boc protecting groups provided intermediate 26. Suzuki coupling with phenyl boronic acid yielded compound 27. The potencies of these analogs for MK2, CDK2 and in cell based TNFa assay are shown in Table 2. Substitution of the furan ring did not improve selectivity for MK2 over CDK2 and a loss of overall potency was observed for both kinases. Similarly, a loss of cellular potency was also observed. Broad panel kinase selectivity screening of 24 was conducted. A total of 126 kinases were profiled at 1 lM concentration and 14 kinases (11%) showed >70% inhibition. Substitution at the pyridine ring was less detrimental to potency. Less than a 10-fold drop in MK2 potency was observed comparing 19 to 27; however the ratio of MK2 to CDK2 potency was improved approximately 20-fold. This improvement in selectivity may be rationalized by the different trajectories of the aromatic ring emanating from a 5-versus a 6-membered ring. Furthermore, the cell potency was well below 1 lM. Compound 26 had MK2 potency and CDK2 selectivity intermediate between 19 and 27 suggesting that the size of the 2-substituent may play a role in both potency and selectivity. Intermediate 26 provided a convenient late stage intermediate for facile analog synthesis via Suzuki coupling. Results are summarized in Table 3. The analogs described in Table 3 are within approximately 10fold in potency for MK2 indicating that most substitutions are well tolerated. Many analogs have improved selectivity ratios compared

to 27, however, indicating that substitution in this region has an impact on selectivity. Compounds 29 and 35 have cell potency values below 500 nM and have >1000-fold selectivity for MK2 versus CDK2. To better understand the potency and selectivity of these compounds, a crystal structure of 35 in MK2 was obtained at 3.7 Å and is shown in Figure 2. While this is a low resolution crystal structure, some analysis may be made. The lactam carbonyl interacts with the conserved Lys93 and the Asp207 of the activation loop. The 3-pyridyl nitrogen appears to make no meaningful interaction with MK2, but the group occupies the same space as the previously described selective series of MK2 inhibitors.

The selectivity of 29 and 35 was investigated by screening against a subset panel of kinases comprised of targets that previous series of compounds had inhibitory activity against. Of the 50 kinases targeted for screening, only 4 had >70% inhibition at 1 lM (AMPK, PIM1, MEKK5 and BRSK1). The mechanism of action within the cell based assay was assessed by comparing inhibition of phosphorylation of Ser78 on HSP27 within the cell to TNFa suppression as described previously.1 The IC50 values for phosphorylated HSP27 were within 2 fold of TNFa IC50 values for both of these inhibitors with no effect on levels of phospho-p38 or phospho-JNK2. The correlation between a target biomarker and suppression of cytokine release indicates that both 29 and 35 are inhibiting TNFa expression by selectively inhibiting MK2. In summary, we have discovered a new, potent and selective class of MK2 inhibitors that have less than 500 nM potency in a cell-based assay. Selectivity was improved by modification of the hinge binding element into a ring to provide a scaffold for the required selectivity element. The in vivo pharmacology of these inhibitors will be described in a future communication. References and notes
