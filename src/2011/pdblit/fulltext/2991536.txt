An X-ray crystallographic structure analysis has been carried out on t,he complex between the antibiotic and DNA fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 and a synthetic B-DNA dodecamer of sequence C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G. The drug molecule, which can be schematized as: phenol-benzimidazole-benzimidazole-piperazine, sits within the minor groove in the A-TT-C region of the DNA double helix, displacing the spine of hydration that is found in drugfree DIVA. The NH groups of the benzimidazoles make bridging three-center hydrogen bonds between adenine N-3 and thymine O-2 atoms on the edges of base-pairs, in a manner both mimicking the spine of hydration and calling to mind the binding of the auti-tumor drug netropsin. Two conformers of Hoechst are seen in roughly equal populations, related bond: one form in which by 1X0" rotation about the central benzimidazole-benzimidazole the piperazine ring extends out from the surface of the double helix, and another in which it is buried deep within the minor groove. Steric clash between the drug and DNA dictates that the phenol-benzimidazole-benzimidazole portion of Hoechst 33258 binds only to A. T regions of' DNA, whereas the piperazine ring demands the wider groove characteristic of (: . (I regions. Hence. the piperazine ring suggests a possible G. C-reading element for synthetic DNA sequence-reading drug analogs.

1. Introduction This paper reports the X-ray crystallographic st,ructure analysis of the complex of a groovebinding drug, Hoechst 33258 (Fig. l(a)), with a short, K-DNA double helix of sequence: C-G-C-G-AA-T-T-C-(X-G. Several distinct' patterns of DNA-drug interactions have emerged in recent years. (I) Drug molecules that act by binding tightly but non-covalently to double-helical DNA are of t,wo kinds: t'hose that intercalate a flat, multiring structure bet'ween adjacent base-pairs of the helix and those that fit entirely within one groove. (2) The narrow minor groove is the preferred locus of drug binding, not the wider major groove. This applies equally to purely groove-binding drugs, and to intercalating drugs t'hat extend a non-planar chain or group down into an adjacent groove. (3) The greatjest base sequence discrimination is shown by groove-binding drugs, and nearly always this is expressed as a preference for binding sites that, ront'ain only A . T base-pairs. (4) intercalating drugs are less base-specific, but frequently prefer G. C base-pairs becbause of hydrogen bonds formed to the N-2 amine groups of guanines. Is it possible t,o design a long-chain drug analog t,hat will "read" and bind preferentially to any desired DNA base sequence? Netropsin (Fig. l(b)). OOPZ 2836/87;180257-15 $03.00/0 257

the structure of whose DNA complex is known (Kopka et al., 1985a,b,c), demands a binding site with four successive A. T or T. A base-pairs. Hoechst 33258, although similar in overall size. shape, and charge, is more tolerant of G. C base-pairs and also contains one puckered piperazine ring that cannot fit within the narrow A. T region of a H-D?L'A minor groove. The present structural study was carried out with the goal of learning how Hoechst 33258 binds to DNA, and whether this suggests an answer to the problem of designing a G. C-reading drug element. Hoe&t 33258 is a synthetic N-methylpiperazine derivative, one of a series developed by the Hoechst Pharmaceutical Company for potential clinical use (Loewe & Crbanietz, 1968. 1974). Although it did not show anti-neoplastic activity, it is fairly effective as an anthelminthic (LEmmler bz Raether, 1968; Lgmmler et al., 1971). Its major use, however, is as a fluorescent cytological stain for DNA, both in vitro and in &IO. Its brightly fluorescent caomplex with chromosomes shows a marked specificity for A. T-rich regions (Herzog & Schutze, 1968; Hilwig & Gropp, 1972; Kucherlapati et al., 1975). Substitution of bromodeoxyuridine for thymine quenches the fluorescence, an effect that is used as a sensitive probe for DNA replication and strand exchange in dividing cells (Latt. 1973; Perry & Wolff. 1974:

P. E. Pjura et al. proportional to the percentage of A+T in the duplex, and leads to induction of a fluorescence that also is proportional to A+T content (Mikhailov et al., 1981; Miiller 6 Gautier, 1975; Latt & Wohlleb, 1975; Latt & Stetten, 1976). The low-affinity binding mode begins to predominate at higher drugto-phosphate ratios, has a weaker binding constant of approximately lo4 to 10' M-I, is abolished at high salt, insensitive to base composition of the DNA, highly co-operative, and causes quenching of the fluorescence generated by specific binding. The tight binding mode is the one of pharmaceutical and cytological interest, and is the one seen in our X-ray analysis. This tight binding seems to represent interaction with double-stranded B-DNA, since binding to single strands, to RNA or to mixed RNA-DNA duplexes, or to A-DNA is of the low affinity type (Raposa 5, Natarajan, 1974; Miiller & Gautier, 1975; Mikhailov et al., 1981). The tight binding mode shifts the drug's absorption maximum from 338 nm to 345 to 356 nm, induces circular dichroism at 355 nm, and fluorescence emission at 505 nm, all of these being proportional to A+T content of the DNA under conditions of high salt concentration (Weisblum & Haenssler, 1974; Comings, 1975). The minor changes in electric dichroism and birefringence suggest that Hoechst does not appreciably disrupt the double-helical structure. The primary effect is a dramatic rise in TM: 4°C in poly(C-G) and 40°C in poly(A-T), with proportionate increases in mixed polymers of intermediate A+ T composition. The minor groove is implicated as the site of binding by competition studies with other known groove-binding molecules, by the fact that Hoechst binds well to phage T6 DNA in which the major groove is blocked by glycosylation, and by the observation that poly(I-C) behaves more like poly(A-T) than poly (G-C) in its binding of Hoechst (Langlois 6 Jensen, 1979; Sahar & Latt, 1980; Mikhailov et al., 1981). In spite of the foregoing indicated preference for A. T-rich regions of DNA, however, Hoechst 33258 is more tolerant than many groove-binding drugs of isolated G. C base-pairs lying within a predominately A* T binding site (Holmquist, 1975). This tolerance made Hoechst a subject of interest in our present X-ray study. studies have shown that the Footprinting Hoechst 33258 binding site spans three to five basepairs, and gives a weak indication that Hoechst is more tolerant of isolated G. C intrusion at the ends of the binding site than are either netropsin or distamycin (Martin & Holmes, 1983; Harshman & Dervan, 1985). A model, based on all the available Hoechst evidence and the known netropsin-DNA structure, has been proposed in which Hoechst binds non-intercalatively within the minor groove, with its benzimidazole NH group forming bifurcated bridging hydrogen bonds like the amide NH group of netropsin, and with the phenol and piperazine of Hoechst blocking base-pairs to either side of the binding loci (Mikhailov et al., 1981;

have hydrogen-bond-forming NH groups along their concave edge, and an overall positive charge. (Subscripts on nitrogens are identifying labels, not chemical symbols.) Holmquist & Comings, 1975). Growth of cells on low levels of Hoechst 33258 results in a number of

effects on replicating chromosomes, including decondensation in A+T-rich regions (Hilwig & Gropp, 1973; Marcus et al., 1979), the induction of breaks in "fragile" sites (Miiller et al., 1981) and, in conjunction with bromodeoxyuridine, an increased sensitivity to ultraviolet killing of growing cells 1982). (St&ten et al., 1976, 1977; Rosenstein, Hoechst 33258 also finds use in Auorescenceactivated sorting of chromosomes (Kroll, 1984) and in the separation of DNAs based on A+T content, because of induced changes in electrophoretic mobility (Loucks et al., 1979; Miiller et al., 1981). Hoechst 33258 exhibits both a low-level, tight binding to DNA and a high-level, low-affinity mode with quite different characteristics (Bontemps et al., 1975; Stokke & Steen, 1985). The tight-binding mode occurs at a drug-to-phosphate ratio of less than 0*05 to 0.20, with binding constant approximately lo6 to 10'

3. Results
Hoechst 33258 sits within the minor groove as expected (Fig. 2), displacing the zig-zag string of water molecules or spine of hydration that is present in the free DNA (Drew & Dickerson, 1981; Kopka et al., 1983). But as Figure 3(a) shows particularly effectively, the drug molecule appears to have slipped down the helix by one base-pair by comparison with the netropsin complex, making its binding site g-a-A-T-T-C instead of g-A-A-T-T-c?. ___As a consequence, a remnant of the spine of hydration remains at the upper right, of the drug molecule in Figure 2(b); indeed. the phenol -OH group participates by capping off the end of the spine where it meets the drug molecule. The relationship between hydrogen bonding in the spine of hydration, in the netropsin-DNA complex is complex, and in the Hoechst&DNA shown in Figure 4. The first hydration shell of the spine bridges adenine N-3 and thymine O-2 atoms, and is given a local tetrahedral co-ordination by water molecules of the second hydrat,ion shell (Fig. 4(a)). The three amide NH groups of netropsin form bifurcated hydrogen bonds that bridge the same N-3 and O-2 atoms. with the covalent drug backbone replacing the second hydration shell (Fig. 4(b)). The two benzimidazole NH groups of Hoechst 33258 mimic the second and third of these bridges (Fig. 4(c)). The first bridge still is contributed by the spine of hydration, and the phenol -OH group is bonded to that terminal bridging water as though the drug were the continuation of the second hydrat,ion shell of the spine. Actual distances between potentially hydrogenbonding N and 0 atoms are given in Figure 5(a) for the spine of hydration in drug-free DNA, and in Figure 5(b) for the Hoechst-DNA complex. Hydrogen bond distances in the center of the spine of hydration are quite reasonable, but as the spine enters the C * G base-pair regions above and below, steric hindrance with guanine N-2 amine groups causes the spine to pull away from the floor of the groove, making the N-O and N-N distances considerably longer. Ultimately, the spine of hydration ends when its way is blocked by 3'-OH groups from the ends of overlapping neighboring molecules in the crystal. In the Hoechst complex (Fig. 5(b)) the two benzimidazole nitrogen atoms, N-2 and N-3, sit at acceptable distances from DNA O-2 and N-3 atoms, but the phenol and piperazine rings are less comfortably fitted into the groove. The linear geometry of the attachment, of phenol to benzimidazole-1 (Bzl) prevents the phenol ring from following the floor of the minor groove, and keeps the phenol -OH group from approaching close enough for a direct bridging bond to the adenine N3 and thymine O-2 atoms. Instead, as has been

2. Materials and Methods
The dodecadeoxynucleotide C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G was synthesized by the liquid-phase phosphotriester method (Denny et al., 1982; Narang, 1983), deblocked
with verification of deblocking by analytical highpressure liquid chromatography, and purified by 2 passes through an ion exchange DEAE Sephadex A-25 column. Crystals of the complex of DNA and Hoechst 33258 were grown by vapor diffusion from a starting solution containing 0.21 mM-DNA. 0.21 mM-Hoechst 33258, 5.38 mM-Mg(OAc),, 0.21 mM-spermine acetate (pH 7.0) and 20y0 (w/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). Addition of Hoechst precipitated the DNA as a yellowish, oily mass that slowly went back into solution during the course of crystal growth. Crystals grew over a period of 8 weeks, appearing at 35% MPD. The largest crystals were approximately 0.15 mm x 0.20 mm x 0.80 mm. They were nearly isomorphous with native DNA crystals, with space group P2,2,2, and cell dimensions: a=25.04A, b=40.33&c=65.85A (lA=O.lnm). Data to a resolution of 2.2 A were collected on a Syntex Pl-bar diffractometer, with 45% of the 3487 unique reflections observed above the 2-sigma level. The DNA-Hoechst structure was solved by molecular replacement, using the final co-ordinates of the native C-G-C-GA-A-T-T-C-G-C-G as a starting model (Drew et al., 1981). The initial residual error or R factor for all O-sigma data between 8.0 A and 2.2 A was 46.6%. Four stages of Jack & Levitt (1978) restrained least squares refinement were carried out with increasing resolution, allowing the co-ordinates of the DNA to refine to convergence at each stage but holding t,emperature factors constant at 20.0. Only when co-ordinate refinement was complete at 2.2 a were temperature factors allowed to refine isotropically. The final R factor prior to introduction of solvent or of the drug molecule was 31.7%. Forty solvent molecules were added in stages, where indicated by difference maps, avoiding the region of the minor groove where a putative Hoechst 33258 image was already visible, and these solvent molecules lowered the R factor to 28.0%. At this point, the minor groove region of the refined difference map was examined on an Evans and Sutherland Picture System II graphics station using the program FRODO (Jones, 1978). The otherwise unexplained electron density (see Figs 9 to 11 of Dickerson et al.: 1986) had the shape expected for an image of the Hoechst 33258 molecule at 2.2 A resolution, and so the framework of the drug was built into the density. The end-for-end orientation of the Hoechst molecule within the groove was clear; there was no mistaking the flat phenol ring with its protuberant -OH group. for the bulky mass of the piperazine. Refinement was continued after addition of the drug molecule, with addition of more solvent peaks. The final structure contained 1 DNA double-helical dodecamer, 1 Hoechst 33258 drug molecule, and 175 solvent peaks. The final R factor was 14.0% for 2-sigma data or 19,l o/0 for all data, in the range 8.0 to 2.2 A resolution. As with all structures from the laboratory, both the original X-ray diffraction data and the final refined coordinates have been placed in the public domain by deposition in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

(b) Complex of DNA with Hoechst 33258, with the drug molecule in the lower half of the minor groove, and the undisplaced spine of hydration in the upper half. The small crossed sphere is phenol oxygen. mentioned, the -OH plays the role of a second-shell water molecule of the spine of hydration. The two benzimidazole rings of Hoechst, like the pyrrole rings of netropsin. are fitted tightly into the narrow A. T region of the minor groove, which is barely wide enough to admit them. This tight fit is illustrated for Bzl in Figure 3(b), and the section through Bz2 is similar. In order that each benzimidazole should sit parallel to the walls of the groove in its own local region, Bzl and Bz2 must be twisted by 36" around the bond that connects them. The phenol ring (Phe), in contrast, remains coplanar with Bzl, presumably a consequence of resonance st8abilization of the two conjugated systems. Hence, Phe is twisted slightly out of parallel with the walls of the groove, but this is permissible because Phe is not as deeply buried on the floor of the groove as are Bzl and Bz2. The piperazine ring (Pip) is involved in an energy trade-off that leads to a kind of interesting Q. C specificity. When Hoechst 33258 is free in solution. steric clash between the piperazine -CH,and benzimidazole -CH- groups makes the most favored orientation about the Bz2-Pip, bond, that' in which the best mean planes through the two rings are at right angles. Space-filling CPK models indicate a serious steric clash if the two rings are made to approach coplanarity. Yet a crossways piperazine ring cannot' hope to fit within a narrow minor groove that is barely wide enough to accept a 3.5 w thick aromatic ring edgeways. The compromise between mutually conflicting demands is seen in cross-section in Figure 3(c). The best plane through the puckered Pip ring lies approximately 30" away from perpendicularity to the Bz2 plane, or 60" away from parallelism to the walls of the minor groove. Even this compromise would be impossible in the intrinsically narrower A *T region of the groove. The drug is forced to slide downward until it)s piperazine can nest within the wider C: * C region.

Fig. 2. Hence, the piperazine is a weak G. C-reading element, sensing t'he fact that in B-DNA the minor groove is intrinsically wider in G. C regions than in A .T (Fratini et al., 1982). Although the best mean plane through Pip can be det,ermined with confidence at 2.2A resolution, the puckering of the ring is less definite. The chair conformation with atom N-5 pointing toward the floor of the groove and N-6 outward, as in Figure 2(b), appears to be the most likely because it positions the Pip ring best within the observed electron density. Rotation of 180" around the Bz2Pip bond to point the N-5 atom upward and N-6 toward the bottom of the groove would push the ring too far down into the groove. This could be relieved somewhat by flattening out the bond geometry around N-5 and assuming a greater aromatic character, as has been observed in three other single crystal analyses of drugs containing the piperazine ring attached to another ring (Petcher & Weber, 1976). But at our limited 2.2 A resolution, although the location of the piperazine ring is unambiguous, d&ails of its puckering must remain conjectural. There is yet another twist to the piperazine story. The observed electron density suggests a statistical distribution of the Pip ring between two alternative positions: down within the minor groove as in Figure 2(b), and extended out of the groove as in Figure 6. Both images occurred in the first electron density difference map used to locate the drug molecule, and persisted in later maps no matter which position of the Pip ring was used in phasing. Assumption of roughly equal contributions from the two conformations gave lower residual errors in least squares refinement than did assumption of either pure conformation, or more unequal ratios. Note that interconversion between these two states is not something that can occur when the drug is bound to DNA, since it requires an 180" rotation about the bond connecting Bzl and Bz2. Binding to DNA only freezes out a conformational equilibrium that pre-existed in the free drug molecule in solution. But, as will be mentioned in the Discussion? these two conformers of Hoechst enable it to tolerate either A. T or G. C base-pairs at the Pip end of its binding site, giving it an ada,pt,abilitythat is forbidden to netropsin.

The native DNA structure has the sequence C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G, and has a IQ" sideways bend in the overall helix axis (Dickerson & Drew, 1981). The MPD7 structure has 5-bromocytosine in place of cytosine at the 9th position, and has an unbent helix axis (Fratini el al., 1982). Netropsin was cocrystallized with the bromocytosine derivative, whose helix axis remained straight, whereas Hoechst 33258 was cocrystallized with the native DNA sequence, and the helix retained the sideways bend that is visible in Fig. 2. In addition, the binding of each drug caused the helix axis to bend backward at the binding site by 6" to 8". (For more precise definitions of helix parameters, see Fratini et al., 1982, and the Appendix to Jurnak & McPherson, 1985.)

As was observed with netropsin, the binding of Hoechst 33258 has very little effect on the local helix parameters of DNA. Table 1 compares mean helix parameters for these two drugs, and the respective free DNA helices to which they were complexed. (Hoechst should be compared with native DNA, and the netropsin with MPD7.) Detailed, step-by-step helix parameters for Hoechst 33258 are given in the Appendix, and can be compared with similar information for netropsin in Kopka et a2. (1985u) or for the parent DNA helices in the Appendix to Jurnak & McPherson (1985). Helical twist and rise per base-pair are virtually unchanged by the binding of either drug, as are the inclination of base-pairs to the helix axis and their displacement from tha,t axis. The main alterations produced by Hoechst binding are a 5" mean increase in propeller twist, and shift of main-chain torsion angle delta (C~~,j-C~4,&3,1- O,,,,) at purines by an average of 10" toward a (more C-2'-e&o-like conformation. Pyrimidines remain clustered in the C-l'-exo region. The structural significance of these

changes were observed between the native and MPD7 variants of the drug-free DNA. Both Hoechst and netropsin exert two overall effects on the DNA helix when they bind: they widen the minor groove, and bend the helix axis backward by 6" to 8" at the binding site. Maximum widening for Hoechst (Fig. 7) occurs at the lower end of the helix as viewed in Figure 2(b), where the piperazine ring forces itself into the too-narrow groove. The base-pair normal vector plot in Figure 8 shows a pronounced bend between the upper half of the helix (base-pairs 1 t,o 6) and the lower half (base-pairs 7 to 12), a bend that opens in the vicinity of Bz2. the groove maximally 4. Discussion Hoechst 33258 and netropsin are similar drug molecules in overall size, charge, and shape. Each is a cationic polymer of flat and generally aromatic rings, with hydrogen bond donating NH groups on

The best mean plane through the puckered piperazine ring (purple) makes an angle of roughly 60" with a plane bisecting the minor groove.

et al. the concave edge. They b&h bind preferentially within the minor groove of the B double helix. forcing the walls of the groove aside and bending the helix axis slightly when they do so. They differ in their base preference: netropsin wants a site consisting only of A . T base-pairs because of sterics clash that would result with guanine X-2 amine groups if G . C base-pairs were present (Kopka et 01.. 1987). The first t'hree-quarters of the Hoechst molecule show the same specificity. but the bulky and non-planar piperazine ring demands the wider groove that only a G * (' region can provide. Hence. in t,he same base sequence, the natural binding site for netropsin is g-A-A-T-T-c. whereas that for Hoechst 33258 is g-a-A-T-T-C. The binding sites of the two drugs are of similar size; the leading phenol of Hoec>hst covers and protect's its base-pair WCII though it does not hydrogen bond directly to it. But Hoechst makes one fewer bridging hydrogen bond than does netropsin. which probably explains why its binding constant to DNA is lower by two t,o three orders of magnitude. Is Hoechst 33258 a good model for C: . C-specific base-pair recognition! One outgrowth of t.he netropsin-I)KA st)ructure analysis was the concept of a lexitropsin or a netropsin analog that could be finely tuned to recognize any desired sequence of A. T and G C base-pairs (Kopka et al., 1985b,c; Lawn et al., 1986a). Tt was hoped that replacement of one or more of the two ,V-methylpyrrole rings of netropsin (Fig. l(b)) by LV-methylimidazole, i.e. replacement of the Dh'A-contacting -CH- group by -N-. would both make room for the N-2 amine group of guanine, and offer an acceptor site for a new hydrogen bond involving this amine (see Fig. 5 of Kopka rt al.. 1985b). Several lexitropsin variants of netropsin have been synthesized by Lawn and examined by footprint,ing and solution binding studies (Lawn rt al., 19866). These studies seem to indicat,e that replacement of pyrrole by imidazole has not made the individual interaction site-specific for C:. C instead of A. T, but has merely made it non-specific, accepting either base-pair indiscriminat'ely. The problem is that G. C' specificity means exclusion of A. T, and it is difficult to imagine how
steric clash might reject a base-pair that is smaller

But' the added hydrogen bond between the guanine amine and imidazole groups at each G . C site in a lexitropsin molecule does not seem to be sufficient to discriminate
between a G. C and an A . T base-pair. The oxygen

Distances are from water oxygens or drug nitrogens, to adenine N-3 or thymine O-2 atoms of DNA base-pairs. Distances less than 4 A are dashed, and distances greater than 4 A are dotted.

atom of a furan group might be better than the nitrogen atom of an imidazole group, and the lexitropsin concept will need further testing?.
t Zakrzewska et al. (1987) have noted the fact that substitution of imidazole for pyrrole appears to make that site on a lexitropsin non-specific, rather than G. Cspecific as desired. They have used this to conclude that, " . the contacts between the adenine C2 and pyrrole hydrogens, considered by some as being at the origin of AT specificity of this type of ligands (sic) do not play, in fact, any determinant role in this specificity," arguing

thereafter, on theoretical grounds, for the primacy of electrostatic effects in drug/base specificity. Electrostatic theories aside, their rejection of steric factors, on the basis of the lexitropsin work, is logically flawed. As an analogy, consider a parking lot in which small parking stalls (pyrroles) are intended for Volkswagens (adenines). and large parking stalls (imidazoles) are meant for Cadillacs (guanines). The observation that a Volkswagen can fit into a Cadillac parking stall, provides no logical grounds for asserting that size is immaterial in designing parking spaces, or that an egalitarian parking lot owner could not discriminate against Cadillacs by providing only small parking stalls.

A transition between this and the internal Pip state of Fig. 2(b) must involve a 180" rotation about the bond connecting the 2 benzimidazoles, and hence must take place when the drug is not bound to DNA.

What other criteria might one use to pick a G * C base pair and reject an A. T? The Hoechst 33258 results suggest that groove width could possibly be a partial answer. A B-DNA region of several contiguous G 1C base-pairs will have an intrinsically

The widening of the groove produced by Hoechst binding at PI0 to PI9 and PI1 to PI8 occurs in the vicinity of the 2nd benzimidazole and piperazine rings.

wider minor groove than one of contiguous A. T base-pairs, a consequence primarily of the greater propeller twist of A 1T base-pairs (Fratini et al., 1982). But it is not obvious, without direct X-ray crystallographic structure evidence, that a G * C pair isolated within an A *T region would cause enough of a local bulging out of the minor groove to be recognized by a bulky drug component such as piperazine . Piperazine "reading" might of necessity be cocfined only to contiguous G * C pairs. The preference of a puckered six-membered ring for G * C regions of DNA is also encountered in other drug molecules, including some that also intercalate between base-pairs. In the complex of the antitumor drug daunomycin with the B-DNA hexamer C-G-T-A-C-G (Quigley et al., 1980), the aglycone ring intercalates between a C +G and the subsequent G. C base-pair at each end of the helix, and the amino sugar lies flat on the bottom of the minor groove in a manner resembling the piperazine of
Hoechst. Non-intercalative minor-groove-binding

drugs that favor G * C base-pairs are rare, but chromomycin, mithramycin, and olivomycin are three related examples. Van Dyke & Dervan (1983) have shown by footprinting that these drugs prefer at least two adjacent G * C pairs. In the light of our
Hoechst structure it is interesting to note that all

Figure 8. Base plane normal vector plot, showing the bend in helix axis produced by the binding of Hoechst 33258. To understand this plot, imagine that the DNA dodecamer helix sits with its axis normal to the plane of the page, and with its minor groove (toward the reader in Fig. 2) facing downward, along the positive y axis. PheBz2-Bzl-Pip-indicate locations of the 4 components of Hoechst as they wind around the helix axis. The x and y axes are components of the changes in direction cosines of the normal vectors to base-pairs 1 through 12, changes that result from the binding of Hoechst. The observations that the normal vector points for base-pairs 1 through 4 cluster around one position marked by + , and that those for base-pairs 9 through 12 cluster around a different position + , mean that the helix axis is bent backward at its center. The distance between the 2 points + , roughly 0.10, indicates a bending of sin-' (0.10)=6". The bending is in a direction away from Bz2, the 2nd benzimidazole. (For normal vector plots of other variants of the helix CG-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G, see Dickerson et al., 1983; Kopka et al, 1985b.)

three of these antibiotics contain multiple hexopyranose rings. One might expect to find them nested within the wider G +C regions of the minor groove like the piperazine of Hoechst. The problem of engineering a G * C-specific element into a groove-binding drug has yet to be solved. In Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers, after a gondolier-become-king promotes everyone in the kingdom to the ranks of admiral, general,

archbishop, and nobleman, one character complains, "When everybody's Somebody, no one's Anybody." The essence of specificity is exclusion. Mere acceptance of G. C base-pairs is not enough; there must be a simultaneous rejection of A* T. If the concept' of "reading" of DNA sequence by drug polymers is to have any real meaning, then some kind of A. T-rejecting element must be found.

APPENDIX

Helix Parameters for the Hoechst 33258-DNA
Tables 2 through 4 list important helical parameters for the complex of Hoechst 33258 with C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G using the final refined co-ordinates. These were calculated using the HELIX program written by John Rosenberg, and the ROLL, CYLIN, and TORAN programs by R. E. Dickerson. Equivalent Tables for the complex of netropsin with C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-b'C-G-

Complex

C-G are given in the Appendix of Kopka et al. (1985a). These should be compared, respectively, with the native and MPD7 helices of DNA alone, given in the Appendix of Jurnak & McPherson (1984). For definitions of the various helix parameters listed in Tables 2 through 4, see the above-mentioned references and also Fratini et al. (1982).
