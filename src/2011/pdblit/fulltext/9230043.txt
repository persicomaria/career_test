ABSTRACT:

The backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of the c-Ha-Ras protein [a truncated version consisting of residues 1-171, Ras(1-171)] bound with GMPPNP (a slowly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP) were assigned and compared with those of the GDP-bound Ras(1-171). The backbone amide resonances of amino acid residues 10-13, 21, 31-39, 57-64, and 71 of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP, but not those of Ras(1-171),GDP, were extremely broadened, whereas other residues of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP exhibited amide resonances nearly as sharp as those of Ras(1-171),GDP. The residues exhibiting the extreme broadening, except for residues 21 and 71, are localized in three functional loop regions [loops L1, L2 (switch I), and L4 (switch II)], which are involved in hydrolysis of GTP and interactions with other proteins. From the temperature and magnetic field strength dependencies of the backbone amide resonance intensities, the extreme broadening was ascribed to the exchange at an intermediate rate on the NMR time scale. It was shown that the Ras(1-171) protein bound with GTP or GTPS (another slowly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP) exhibits the same type of broadening. Therefore, it is a characteristic feature of the GTP-bound form of Ras that the L1, L2, and L4 loop regions, but not other regions, are in a rather slow interconversion between two or more stable conformers. This phenomenon, termed a "regional polysterism", of these loop regions may be related with their multifunctionality: the GTP-dependent interactions with several downstream target groups such as the Raf and RalGDS families and also with the GTPase activating protein (GAP) family. In fact, the binding of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP with the Ras-binding domain (residues 51-131) of c-Raf-1 was shown to eliminate the regional polysterism nearly completely. It was indicated, therefore, that each target/regulator selects its appropriate conformer among those presented by the "polysteric" binding interface of Ras. As the downstream target groups exhibit no apparent sequence homology to each other, it is possible that one target group prefers a conformer different from that preferred by another group. The involvement of loop L1 in the regional polysterism might suggest that the negative regulators, GAPs, bind to the polysteric binding interface (loops L2 and L4) of Ras and cooperatively select a conformer suitable for transition of the GTPase catalytic center, involving loops L1 and L4, into the highly active state.

9110 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 30, 1997 61 are responsible for binding of the phosphate groups of GDP/GTP for GTP hydrolysis and for GTP-dependent interactions with downstream effector proteins. It has been found that Ras,GTP directly binds to the c-Raf-1 protein kinase (7-12) and activates it to phosphorylate and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) kinase (or MEK) (13, 14). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) has also been proposed to be one of the downstream effectors of Ras (15). It has also been found that Ras,GTP binds to RalGDS and RGL, which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors of Ral (Ral-GEFs), and actually activates the Ral-GEF-mediated signaling (1619). Moreover, it is well-known that the GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), such as p120-GAP and NF1, also bind specifically to Ras,GTP and enhance its GTPase activity (20). Although these four families of Ras-binding proteins (Raf kinases, PI3-kinase, Ral-GEFs, and GAPs) have only very limited sequence homology with each other, all of them can bind primarily to the same interface of Ras,GTP, but not Ras,GDP. For understanding how Ras,GTP can interact with the downstream effectors and GAPs through the same binding interface, structural studies are indispensable. Actually, X-ray crystallographic and NMR studies for C-terminaltruncated versions [Ras(1-171) and Ras(1-166) that consist of residues 1-171 and 1-166, respectively] and the fulllength version [Ras(1-189)] of Ha-Ras protein, bound with either GDP or slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogues, have shown that the aforementioned residues, 10-16, 32-40, and 57-61, are all in loop regions (loops L1, L2, and L4, respectively) close to each other on the protein surface (2133). By the X-ray crystallographic studies, the conformational differences between Ras,GDP and Ras,GTP were found mainly in loop L2 (switch I) and the region including loop L4 and helix R2 (switch II) (23-26). However, these "switch" regions take different conformations in the two crystals of GTP analogue-bound Ras, Ras(1-166),GMPPNP (23, 24) and Ras(1-171),GMPPCP (25, 26). In particular, four independent conformations were reported for Ras(1171),GMPPCP. Furthermore, intermolecular contacts between the effector region (switch I or loop L2) and the neighboring Ras molecules were found for both Ras(1166),GMPPNP and Ras(1-171),GMPPCP in the crystals, which might have restricted or altered the conformation of the region. Therefore, NMR studies of the Ras,GTP in aqueous solution may be necessary for probing more details of the "dynamic" conformational differences between Ras, GDP and Ras,GTP. In the previous NMR studies on the Ras proteins (HaRas and N-Ras), the amino acid-selective isotope labeling

Ito et al. method was mainly employed to investigate the structural difference between Ras,GDP and Ras,GTP in aqueous solution (34-48). In the present study, we applied the uniform 13C/15N-labeling and triple-resonance NMR techniques (49) and assigned the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of both Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-171), GMPPNP, in order to examine all the amino acid residues of Ras in terms of conformational differences between the inactive and active forms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Cell Growth. The Escherichia coli strain TG1 was transformed with the expression vector pRGH (50), encoding the first 171 residues of the human c-Ha-Ras protein. The unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled Ras(1-171) proteins were obtained by growing bacteria at 37 °C in M9 minimal media as described previously (34, 41). The uniformly 13C- and 13C/15N-labeled Ras(1-171) samples were prepared in the same conditions as uniformly 15N-labeling except for the D-glucose concentration in the M9 medium (2 g of [13C6]-D-glucose/L). At a turbidity of about 1.0 A600 unit, protein expression was induced by the addition of 50 mg/mL indoleacrylic acid. The cells were harvested after the turbidity reached a plateau level and stored at -80 °C. Protein Purification. All procedures for the protein preparation described below were performed at 4 °C. The cells were washed once, harvested, and resuspended to 0.1 g of cell paste/mL with the lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM PMSF, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 25% sucrose). The cells were lysed with lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL) for 15 min, and then the solution was stirred with DNase I (0.1 mg/mL), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mM MgCl2 for 15 min. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 30000g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia) anion-exchange column preequilibrated with the preparation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM MgCl2). The protein was eluted using a 50-350 mM KCl gradient. Next, the crude protein solution was concentrated using a centriprep 10 concentrator (Amicon) and loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 Superfine (Pharmacia) gel-filtration column and then eluted with the preparation buffer. The fractions containing the protein was concentrated again using a centricon 10 (Amicon) concentrator. Finally, the protein solution was loaded onto a Mono-Q FPLC (Pharmacia) anion-exchange column and eluted using a 0-350 mM KCl gradient. The final sample was stored at -20 °C in 50% glycerol. Preparation of the GTP-Bound Forms of Ras(1-171). In order to prepare the GTP-bound form and to avoid GTP hydrolysis during multidimensional NMR measurements, we used GMPPNP, a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue. Ras(1-171),GTP and Ras(1-171),GTPS samples were also prepared for measurements of 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra. To prepare these "GTP-bound" forms of Ras(1-171), the bound GDP was replaced by GMPPNP, GTP, or GTPS, through incubation of the purified Ras(1-171),GDP (0.5 mM) three times with the triphosphate nucleotide (2 mM) in the presence of 10 mM EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. For the preparation of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP, 10 units/mL apyrase (Sigma, Grade VI) was added to the incubation mixture in order to hydrolyze the released GDP molecules.

Regional Polysterism of Ras,GTP Preparation of Protein Samples for NMR Spectroscopy. Protein samples were concentrated and dissolved in the NMR buffer (90% 1H2O and 10% 2H2O containing 20 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 5.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2) using a centricon 10 concentrator. The final volume was 200 µL. For the 100% 2H2O samples, the concentrated solutions were lyophilized and dissolved in 200 µL of 2H2O. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR experiments were performed for 2-3 mM samples on Bruker AMX600, ARX400, and DRX400 spectrometers under the same condition. All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 computer using the Azara software package (Boucher, unpublished) using a two-dimensional maximum entropy algorithm (51). All of the spectra were analyzed with the combination of customized macroprograms on FELIX Version 2.3 software (BIOSYM Inc.). Backbone Resonance Assignments. The backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments for Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-171),GMPPNP were achieved by analysis of the spin-spin connectivities in four types of 3D triple-resonance spectra, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and HNCO (48, 52) and HCACO (53), and also of the sequential backbone NOEs in the 3D 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra (54, 55). The 3D HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and HNCO spectra were acquired with a total of 64 (t1, 13C) × 32 (t2, 15N) × 512 (t3, 1HN) complex points for the 13C/15N-labeled protein in 90% 1H2O/ 10% 2H2O. The 3D HCACO spectrum was acquired with a total of 32 (t1, 13CR) × 32 (t2, 13CO) × 256 (t3, 1HR) complex points for the 13C-labeled protein in 100% 2H2O. The 3D 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra were acquired with a mixing time of 100 ms and a total of 100 (t1, 1H) × 32 (t2, 15N) × 512 (t , 1H ) complex points for the 15N-labeled 3 N protein in 90% 1H2O/10% 2H2O. A probe temperature of 37 °C was used for these experiments. Temperature and Magnetic Field Dependencies of the 1H15N HSQC Spectra. A series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured for the 15N-labeled Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-171),GMPPNP at probe temperatures of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 °C with the AMX600 spectrometer. At 30 °C, another 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was measured with the DRX400 spectrometer. These 2D HSQC spectra were acquired with 256 (t1, 15N) × 1024 (t2, 1HN) complex points. Backbone Dynamics. 2D 1H-15N correlation spectra to determine the {1H}-15N NOE, T1, and T2 values were recorded for the 15N-labeled Ras(1-171),GDP and 15N-Ras(1-171),GMPPNP essentially as described by Skelton et al. (56). The relaxation parameters were calculated with the DABRET program (Iwahara, unpublished). The 1H-15N HSQC Spectra of Amino Acid SelectiVely 15NLabeled Ras(1-171),GMPPNP in the Complex with the RasBinding Domain of c-Raf-1. The Gly and Asp/Asn selectively 15N-labeled Ras(1-171) samples were prepared as described previously (41). The c-raf-1 gene (57, 58) was provided by the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (JCRB). The DNA fragment encoding the Ras-binding domain (RBD, residues 51-131) of human c-Raf-1 (11, 59) was inserted into the NdeI/SalI site of the expression vector pK7 (60). The unlabeled sample of the Raf-1 RBD was obtained by growing E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (61) transformed with the expression vector in the LB medium at 37 °C. Expression of the protein was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside. The cells were broken by sonication. The protein was purified from the soluble extract by cation-exchange chromatography [a CM-

Each of the Gly and Asp/Asn selectively 15N-labeled Ras(1-171), GMPPNP samples were mixed with the unlabeled c-Raf-1 RBD at a molar ratio of 1:1 and then concentrated and dissolved in the NMR buffer with a centricon 3 (Amicon) concentrator. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired with 256 (t1, 15N) × 1024 (t2, 1HN) complex points at 30 °C for these samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Assignments of the Backbone Resonances of Ras(1-171), GDP. The backbone 1H and 15N resonances have been assigned nearly completely through 2D and 3D 15N-separated NMR experiments performed on amino acid selectively or uniformly 15N-labeled samples at 37 °C (42). In the present study, triple-resonance NMR experiments were performed to confirm the previous assignments and also to assign the backbone 13CR and 13CO resonances. By analysis of the four triple-resonance 3D NMR spectra, HNCA, HNCO, HN(CO)CA, and HCACO, of Ras(1-171),GDP, we assigned all of the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances, except for the 15N resonances of the N-terminal methionine residue and the three proline residues.2 Assignments of the Backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N Resonances of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP. In a similar manner to that employed for Ras(1-171),GDP, the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of most residues of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP at 37 °C could be assigned (Figure 1).2 However, it was
2 The assignments of the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of both Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-171),GMPPNP and the "missing cross peaks" phenomenon specific to Ras(1-171),GMPPNP were reported by Y. Ito, Y. Muto, K. Yamasaki, G. Kawai, T. Miyazawa, M. Walchli, S. Nishimura, and S. Yokoyama at the XVth International ¨ Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems, Jerusalem, Israel, 1992.

9112 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 30, 1997 found that 22 non-proline residues, 10-13, 21, 31-(Pro34)-39, 57-64, and 71, give no detectable 1H-15N cross peaks in the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Ras(1-171), GMPPNP, whereas Ras(1-171),GDP exhibits all of the backbone amide 1H-15N HSQC cross peaks as described above. We confirmed this interesting feature of Ras(1171),GMPPNP by measuring the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15 samples with different types of amino acid-selective 15Nlabeling [Ala, Ala/Val, Asp/Asn, Glu/Gln, Phe, Gly, Gly/ Ser, His, Ile, Lys, Leu, Met, Arg, Val, and Tyr (41)] (data not shown). In summary, for Ras(1-171),GMPPNP, we could not assign the resonances of 22 amide protons, 26 amide nitrogens (including proline residues), 32 R-protons, 25 R-carbons, and 27 carbonyl carbons (Figure 1). Missing Backbone 1H-15N Cross Peaks of Ras(1-171), GMPPNP. Thus, a surprisingly large number of 1H-15N HSQC cross peaks turned out to be missing. It was particularly interesting that the "missing cross peaks" phenomenon was presented specifically for the active GMPPNP-bound form of the Ras protein, but not for the inactive GDP-bound form, and that the residues of missing cross peaks are all from the functionally important regions involved in binding of the - and -phosphate groups of GTP for GTP hydrolysis and for the interaction with downstream effectors and regulators (see Figure 2).2 The disappearance of 1H15N correlation cross peaks was reported in previous papers in which the amino acid-selective 15N-labeling method was applied for glycine, isoleucine, and aspartate residues of N-Ras,GMPPNP and N-Ras,GTPS (44-46) and also for glycine and serine residues of Ha-Ras(1-166),GTPS and Ha-Ras(1-166),GMPPCP (47). They estimated regions for which 1H-15N cross peaks were missing in the GTP analogue-bound Ras by comparing the spectra with those of GDP-bound forms. In the present study, we finally identified all the missing cross peak residues by unambiguously assigning the backbone resonances of the observed 1H-15N cross peaks. Temperature Dependency of the 1H-15N HSQC Spectra. It seemed that the "missing" cross peaks were too broad to be recognized. Some chemical exchange on the NMR time scale causes the dependency of the line shape on the exchange rate. Therefore, in order to examine if all or some of them were observable under different conditions, we first measured the 600/60.8-MHz 1H-15N HSQC spectra at 35, 40, and 45 °C for the uniformly 15N-labeled Ras(1-171), GMPPNP and Ras(1-171),GDP. Figure 3 shows a region of each HSQC spectrum of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP. In addition to the sequentially assigned cross peaks, three very broad cross peaks were observed at 45 °C (see the cross peaks indicated with boxes), indicating that their intensities are higher than those at 35 and 40 °C. This result strongly supported the idea of "intermediate" chemical exchange. We furthermore measured the 1H-15N HSQC spectra at lower temperatures, 30, 25, 20, and further down to 4 °C, but found that the exchange rate was still intermediate even at the lowest temperature (data not shown). Therefore, we could not find any conditions in which the exchange rate had been "slow" enough, on the NMR time scale, to exhibit two (or more) sets of separate cross peaks corresponding to the putative states in exchange. Next, for each of the resolved and assigned 1H-15N HSQC cross peaks of the uniformly 15N-labeled Ras(1-171),GMPPNP and Ras(1-171),GDP at six different temperatures (20-45 °C), the intensity (the peak height) was measured and normalized relative to that at 35

FIGURE 2: The distribution of regions in which 1H-15N correlation cross peaks were missing is colored in red on a ribbon model of the solution structure of Ras(1-171),GDP determined by NMR spectroscopy. The GDP molecule is shown in blue. The detailed description of the side-chain resonance assignment and the structure determination steps will be published elsewhere. The structures were finally calculated using 2653 restraints consisting of 2381 NOEderived distance restraints, 90  and 64 1 dihedral angle restraints, 118 hydrogen bond distance restraints, and additional 11 distance restraints derived from literature data defining interaction between the GDP, the magnesium ion, and the protein. We included similar literature-derived restraints as Kraulis et al. (33) used for the structure calculation of Ras(1-166),GDP. Structures were calculated using the program X-PLOR Version 3.1 (87), employing an ab initio full simulated annealing protocol which starts from an extended strand (88). The root mean square (rms) deviations between the 30 final structures and the average structures are 0.61 Å for backbone atoms and 1.18 Å for all heavy atoms of residues 1-165. The C-terminal residues are disordered in the solution structure. The solution structures of Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-166),GDP are almost identical except for several regions in which the structures were relatively ill-determined for both samples. The rms deviations between these solution structures are 2.09 Å for backbone atoms and 2.79 Å for all heavy atoms of residues 1-165.

°C (Figure 4). For Ras(1-171),GDP, the intensities of all these cross peaks were only slightly increased when the temperature was raised from 20 to 45 °C. This was also the case for the majority of the cross peaks observed for Ras(1-171),GMPPNP. By contrast, it was found that Ras(1-171),GMPPNP exhibits stronger cross peaks at the higher temperature, for residues 8, 15-17, 19, 20, 23-25, 29, 46, 54, 56, 65, 66, 68-70, 72, 74, 76, 79, 81, 90, 93, and 95. It should be noted here that all of these residues are close to loop L1, L2, or L4 in the primary/tertiary structure. Magnetic Field Dependencies of the 1H-15N Correlation Spectra. Then, we measured the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP (30 °C) at a lower field, 9.4 T (the 1H frequency of 400 MHz), for comparison with that at 14.1 T (600 MHz) (Figure 5). Since magnetic field strength and frequency differences are proportional, the weaker the magnetic field strength becomes, the more line shape may sharpen. As expected, three additional cross peaks were observed at the 9.4 T spectrum (see the cross peaks indicated with boxes). As these three cross peaks appeared in the Gly resonance region, the HSQC spectra of the Gly selectively 15N-labeled Ras(1-171) in the GMPPNP-bound form were measured at higher temperatures, 37 and 45 °C, at 9.4 T

Regional Polysterism of Ras,GTP

Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 30, 1997 9113 backbone resonances of Ras(1-171). It should be emphasized, therefore, that the present phenomenon is not restricted to side-chain conformations but is likely to involve stable backbone conformations along the loops. The polysterism of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP is specifically localized in the regions consisting of residues 10-13 (loop L1), 21 (in the center of helix R1), 31-39 (the C-terminal half of loop L2 and a part of strand 2), 57-64 (loop L4), and 71 (in the center of helix R2). These regions are close to each other in the tertiary structure (Figure 2) and may concertedly function as an active site for the GTP hydrolysis and for the GTP-dependent interaction with the downstream effectors and regulators. Consequently, the relatively slow transition between the stable states might be ascribed to cooperative conformational rearrangements among the three loop regions and the phosphate groups. Two "polysteric" residues, Ile21 and Tyr-71, are isolated from the other polysteric loops in the primary structure, but their side chains are likely to be involved heavily in the putative conformational rearrangements. As described above, several residues surrounding the polysteric residues exhibited temperature- and magnetic field-dependent broadenings. However, the degrees of exchange broadening, and therefore the chemical shift differences between the distinct states, of the surrounding residues are much smaller than those of the polysteric residues. Comparison of the Backbone 1HN-15N Chemical Shifts and Dynamic Parameters between Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-171),GMPPNP. Figure 8 shows the differences in the backbone 1HN and 15N chemical shifts between Ras(1-171), GDP and Ras(1-171),GMPPNP. The resonances most shifted upon GDP to GMPPNP exchange are distributed near the polysteric regions. We also analyzed the backbone dynamics of both Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-171), GMPPNP, using the steady-state {1H}-15N NOE and the longitudinal and transverse 15N relaxation rates (T1 and T2, respectively) of each residue (62). The NOE, T1, T2, and T1/T2 values are plotted along the amino acid sequence in Figure 9. As in the case of Ras(1-166),GDP (33), residues 27-32, 58-66, and 107-109 (loops L2, L4, and L7, respectively) of Ras(1-171),GDP exhibit significantly rapid internal motions on the sub-nanosecond time scale. In contrast, in Ras(1-171),GMPPNP, the 15N T2 values of residues 7, 8, 14, 56, 66, and 70, which are near the polysteric regions, are shorter than those of other residues, indicating contributions of slower internal motions. This may suggest that some of the residues surrounding the regions exhibiting the polysterism are somewhat directly involved in the putative conformational rearrangements between the polysteric states. Comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC Spectra of Ras(1171),GDP, Ras(1-171),GMPPNP, Ras(1-171),GTPS, and Ras(1-171),GTP. We also measured the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Ras(1-171) bound with GTPS, which is another slowly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP. Next, we tried to measure the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Ras(1171),GTP, where GTP is the natural substrate of the Ras GTPase activity. Actually, by measurement of an HSQC spectrum, it was found that about 60% of the prebound GTP molecules in the sample of Ras(1-171),GTP had already been hydrolyzed to GDP during the sample preparation process. The decrease in the intensities of the Ras(1-171), GTP cross peaks and the increase in those of the Ras(1171),GDP cross peaks were monitored during incubation for

(Figure 6). The three cross peaks were observed relatively well at 45 °C (see the cross peaks indicated with boxes in Figure 6) but could not be assigned sequentially because the protein was denatured more rapidly at 45 °C than at 37 °C. On the other hand, the spectra at 9.4 T/37 °C gave us sufficient sequential NOEs to assign another 1H-15N cross peak, which was extremely broadened at 14.1 T, to Ile-21. Then, for the two magnetic fields, 9.4 and 14.1 T, the intensities of all resolved and sequentially assigned cross peaks were obtained and normalized relative to that of the C-terminal residue, Leu-171, as shown in Figure 7. Again, several residues surrounding loops L1, L2, and L4 (residues 16, 29, 54, 68, 70, 72, 76, and 100) exhibited stronger cross peaks at 9.4 T than at 14.1 T. "Regional Polysterism". From these temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra, we concluded that the cross peaks of the residues in loops L1, L2, and L4 of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP were extremely broadened because of a chemical exchange at an intermediate rate on the NMR time scale and were therefore unobservable under the conditions of 37 °C and 14.1 T. The intensities of the extremely broadened cross peaks were lower than the noise level, 0.05 of those of the normal cross peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. As the conversion rate is remarkably slow, the exchange is probably between two or more stable conformations of the loop regions. In contrast, the fluctuations or segmental motions of unstructured loops in proteins usually cause relatively sharper NMR signals than those from the protein core. We therefore distinguished the characteristic conformational multiplicity of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP from the usual flexibility of loop regions and termed it "polysterism". In the present study, we examined the

18 h at 25 °C; the population of Ras(1-171),GTP was reduced by half approximately every 3 h. Thus, the "pure" HSQC spectrum of Ras(1-171),GTP was obtained by subtracting the HSQC spectrum measured after the incubation for 18 h (GTP in the sample had mostly been hydrolyzed to GDP) from the spectrum that was initially measured before the incubation and corrected with the observed GTP:GDP ratio. Figure 10 shows a comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Ras(1-171),GDP, Ras(1-171),GMPPNP, Ras(1-171),GTPS, and Ras(1-171),GTP. Two different regions (top and bottom) are shown.

In the HSQC spectra of Ras(1-171),GTPS and Ras(1171),GTP, cross peaks were observed exactly at, or very close to, the spectral positions corresponding to the cross peaks of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP and were therefore assigned tentatively. In the Ras(1-171),GTPS spectrum, five or more cross peaks were additionally observed, which are four to five times broader than the normal cross peaks, while a

FIGURE 8: Chemical shift perturbation of backbone 1HN, 15N, 13CR, and 13CO nuclei upon GDP to GMPPNP exchange represented on the solution structure of Ras(1-171),GDP. The residues whose backbone resonances were affected on the nucleotide exchange are displayed color coded. The mean shift difference av for each amino acid was calculated as [(1HN)2 + (15N)2 + (13CR)2 + (13CO)2]1/2, where 1HN, 15N, 13CR, and 13CO are the chemical shift differences (Hz) between Ras(1-171),GDP and Ras(1-171),GMPPNP for resonances 1HN, 15N, 13CR, and 13CO observed at 14.1 T (the 1H frequency is 600 MHz), respectively. The color coding is as follows: gray (av < 50); light purple (50 e av < 100); light blue (100 e av < 150); green (150 e av < 200); yellow (200 e av < 500); and orange (av g 500). The regions where the regional polysterism was found as the extreme line broadening of 1H-15N correlation cross peaks for Ras(1-171), GMPPNP are shown in red. The GDP molecule is colored blue.

number of cross peaks are still missing under the noise level. For the Ras(1-171),GTP spectrum, we found about 20 additional cross peaks, which are two to four times broader than the normal ones. These significantly broad 1H-15N cross peaks additionally observed for Ras(1-171),GTPS and Ras(1-171),GTP probably correspond to those extremely broadened, and therefore unobservable, in the Ras(1-171),GMPPNP spectrum. Moreover, several cross peaks, which were broadened but observable for Ras(1-171),

GMPPNP, exhibited increased heights in the Ras(1-171), GTPS and Ras(1-171),GTP spectra (see the cross peaks indicated with boxes in Figure 10). All these results indicate that not only Ras(1-171),GMPPNP but also Ras(1-171), GTPS and Ras(1-171),GTP exhibit the characteristic regional polysterism localized in the same functional loop regions, while the rate of the putative conformational rearrangement slightly increases in the order of GMPPNP, GTPS, and GTP. It is intriguing that the structural differences around the - and -phosphate groups between GMPPNP, GTPS, and GTP affect the conversion rate, which will be helpful in the future study on the nature of the conformational transition. Comparison with the X-ray Crystallographic Studies. X-ray crystallographic studies on Ras(1-166),GMPPNP and Ras(1-171),GMPPCP have reported that the structural differences between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms are found mainly in the regions consisting of residues 30-38 (switch I) and 57-77 (switch II) (23-26). Note that these switch regions include loops L2 and L4, but not loop L1, among the three polysteric loop regions identified in the present study. The conformations of the three loop regions (residues 1013, 31-39, and 57-64), which are polysteric in solution, were well determined in the crystal structure of Ras(1-166), GMPPNP, although residues 61-64 show relatively large thermal B-factors in the crystal (23, 24). In this crystal structure of Ras(1-166),GMPPNP, residues 12, 13, 32, 34, 61, 63, and 88 of one Ras(1-166) molecule are close (within 4 Å) to the effector region of another Ras(1-166) molecule; the side chain of Tyr-32 is in a hydrophobic intermolecular interaction and forms a hydrogen bond of its hydroxyl group with the -phosphate of GMPPNP bound to the neighboring Ras(1-166) molecule. These contacts in the crystal might have fixed the conformations of the loop regions, which are inherently polysteric. In contrast, in the crystal of Ras(1-171),GMPPCP, the four independent molecules exhibit different conformations in terms of the two switch regions (residues 30-38 and 5973), depending upon their distinct intermolecular contacts. For example, the side chain of Tyr-32 of Ras(1-171),

FIGURE 11: Contour plots of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of (A) Gly and (B) Asp/Asn selectively 15N-labeled Ras(1-171),GMPPNP in the complex with Raf-1 RBD. The cross peaks which were observed at positions similar to those for Ras(1-171),GMPPNP were tentatively assigned. The seven (four for the Gly and three for the Asn/Asp selectively 15N-labeled sample) cross peaks which were not observed for the Ras(1-171),GMPPNP alone are indicated by boxes.

two conformers, as in the crystal structure of Ras(1-166), GMPPNP (23, 24). It is possible that these different conformations of the switch regions selected in the crystal are elements of the conformation set that characterizes the polysteric state of these regions of Ras in the GTP-bound form in solution. The Regional Polysterism of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP Was Significantly Reduced upon Binding with the Ras-Binding Domain of c-Raf-1. In order to examine how the regional polysterism of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP is affected by upon complex formation with a downstream target, c-Raf-1, we measured the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Gly and Asp/Asn selectively 15N-labeled Ras(1-171),GMPPNP in the complex with the Ras-binding domain (RBD, residues 51-131) of c-Raf-1 (11, 59) (Figure 11). The cross peaks were observed at positions similar to those for the free state of Ras(1171),GMPPNP and could therefore be tentatively assigned. What should be emphasized is that seven cross peaks that were too broad to be detected for Ras(1-171),GMPPNP by itself are clearly observed (four Gly and three Asn/Asp cross peaks) for Ras(1-171),GMPPNP in the complex with the c-Raf-1 RBD. This finding indicates that the conformations of the polysteric loops of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP are mostly fixed upon the RBD binding. It is strongly suggested that the conformations of the three loops are cooperatively interrelated in the presence of the -phosphate group, because the binding of the c-Raf-1 RBD fixes the conformations of not only the effector binding interface (loop L2 and possibly loop L4) but also the GTPase catalytic center (loops L1 and L4). The cross peak of an Asp/Asn residue is still "missing". In this context, it has been found that the Ras protein binds not only to RBD but also to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of c-Raf-1 (63-67). Consequently, the additional interaction of the c-Raf-1 CRD may fix the conformation of the cross peak-missing Asp/Asn residue, which is still polysteric in the complex of Ras(1-171),GMPPNP only with the c-Raf-1 RBD. Consistently, the solution structures of the c-Raf-1 RBD (68, 69) and CRD (70) in the absence of Ras have been found to exhibit no indication of polysterism unlike the GTP-bound form of Ras. The wild-type and mutant proteins of a Ras homologue, Rap1A, bound with GMPPNP and c-Raf-1 RBD are not polysteric in the crystalline state

(71, 72), while it has not yet been examined if Rap1A, GMPPNP has an intrinsic regional polysterism by itself in solution. Relationship between the Regional Polysterism and Biological Functions of the Ras Protein. The finding of the regional polysterism characteristic to the GTP-bound form of Ras provides a possible mechanism of how Ras can interact properly with a variety of target groups, such as Raf kinases, Ral-GEFs, PI3-kinase, and GAPs, using its common binding interface, although these target groups exhibit no noticeable sequence homology to one another, except for the very weak homology between Raf and Ral-GEF RBD families (73). We now propose a hypothesis that a downstream target generally selects its favorite element among the conformer set presented by the polysteric regions of the GTP-bound form of Ras. The interaction with GAPs significantly enhances the GTPase activity, whereas interactions with downstream effectors only enhance it slightly. Indeed, a recent report on the interaction between the Ras,GDP,AlF4- complex with GAPs or Raf-1 suggests that GAPs have an ability to stabilize an active conformation of Ras,GDP,AlF4- complex, while Raf-1 does not (74). The mechanism of the GTPase reaction has been investigated (75-78), but it has still been unclear whether some GAP residues contribute directly to the catalysis in the complex (79-82) or GAPs just stabilize a particular conformation that can express a very high GTPase activity of Ras (77). By replacing Gly-12 or Gly-13 by unnatural amino acids, it was suggested that loop L1 of the GTP-bound c-Ha-Ras can adopt two or more conformations in solution, and the switching between them is presumably important for the GAP-induced GTPase enhancement (83). The regional polysterism involving the three functional loops of Ras may indicate that the binding of GAPs selects one conformation of the binding interface and then cooperatively induces a transition of the conformation of the GTPase catalytic center into the highly active one. When we were preparing this paper, a 31P NMR study was reported, suggesting two conformational states around the phosphate groups of GMPPNP bound to Ras (84). The two conformational states are distinguished from each other only at 0 °C, and the large chemical shift difference of 0.7

9118 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 30, 1997 ppm can be averaged out at higher temperatures (84). They concluded the two states are characterized by the different orientations of the Tyr-32 side chain (84). Their observations are coincident with ours, in particular, in the points that they proposed the existence of multiple (two in their report) conformations and the stabilization of one conformation by the complex formation with the Raf-1 RBD. By simulating the contribution of the exchange to the 31P line shapes, they calculated the exchange rates at various temperatures between the two states. Using their exchange rates and our experimental 15N relaxation parameters for Ras(1-171),GMPPNP, and supposing that the number of states of the regional polysterism is two, we simulated the 15N line shapes via the Bloch equation by using the GAMMA Version 3.4 library (85). The minimum chemical shift differences that cause the reduction in the signal intensity down to the noise level were estimated to be around 500 Hz at 30 °C (exchange rate: 3421 Hz). It seems that such large chemical shift differences in 1H and/or 15N dimensions for all three polysteric loop regions may not be fully explained by the ring current shift proposed in the 31P study (84). Furthermore, in the case of GTPS binding, there is no indication of two conformational states in the 31P spectra (84), while the extreme line broadening was found for ten and more 1H15N HSQC cross peaks for Ras(1-171),GTPS in the present study. Accordingly, we would propose that the transition of the Tyr-32 side-chain conformation is a subprocess of the wider range regional polysterism process in the three functional loops, centering the -phosphate group.
