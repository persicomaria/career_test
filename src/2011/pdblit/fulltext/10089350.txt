Stabilization of the i-motif by intramolecular adenine±adenine±thymine base triple in the structure of d(ACCCT)
The crystal structure of d(ACCCT), solved by molecular replacement, shows a four-stranded i-motif conformation, where two parallel duplexes intercalate with one another in opposite orientations. Each duplex is stabilized by hemiprotonated C±C+ base pairing between parallel strands, and a string of water molecules bridge the cytosine N4 atoms to phosphate O atoms. This structure of d(ACCCT) shows examples of reversed Hoogsteen and Watson±Crick base pairing in both intermolecular and intramolecular manners to stabilize the tetraplex. Noticeably, the four-stranded complex is further stabilized at one end by a three-base hydrogenbonding network, in which two adenines and a thymine form four hydrogen bonds via a reverse Hoogsteen and an asymmetric adenine±adenine base pairing. The structure of d(ACCCT) shows a similar local structure to that found in the d(TAA) part of the crystal structure of d(TAACCC) and provides further structural evidence that these base arrangements are essential for stabilizing these novel DNA supersecondary structures.

1. Introduction
Metazoan telomeric DNA is composed of tandem repeats of d(5H -GGGTTA-3H ) on one strand (G-rich strand) and the sequence d(5H -TAACCC-3H ) on the complementary strand (C-rich strand). The G-rich strand at the 3H terminus typically exists as a single-stranded overhang and is able to form a novel DNA super-secondary structure known as a guanine quartet. The degree of polymorphism has been demonstrated (Williamson, 1994; Rhodes & Giraldo, 1995; Brown & Hunter, 1997) and potential biological roles have been proposed (Kang et al., 1992; Zakian, 1995). It is believed that the telomeres may be a structural regulatory element for the interaction between the telomeric DNA and the enzyme telomerase (Blackburn, 1991). Despite the high degree of polymorphism among G-quartet structures, all of these structures are mainly stabilized by the same interactions. These include a network of eight hydrogen bonds created by four guanines arranged in a plane, stacking interactions between these planes and the coordination of monovalent cations. More recently, an NMR study of d(CCCCC) showed that it can also form a four-stranded structure with cytosinecontaining parallel duplexes held together by hemiprotonated (C±C+) base pairs and two duplexes intercalated with each other in opposite polarity (Fig. 1; Gehring et al., 1993; Leroy et al., 1994). It has been known that nucleic acid polymers with spans of cytosine residues can form parallel duplexes stabilized by hemi-protonated (C±C+) base pairs (Langridge & Rich, 1963; Akinrimisi et al., 1963; Inman, 1964; Hartman &

Rich, 1965). Several crystal structures of variations of C-rich metazoan telomeric DNA sequences, such as d(CCCC), d(CCCT), d(TAACCC) and d(CCCAAT), have been reported at various resolutions (Fig. 1; Chen et al., 1994; Kang et al., 1994, 1995; Berger et al., 1995). In all these structures, the four-stranded complexes contain two parallel duplexes intercalated within one another in an antiparallel orientation. These individual parallel duplexes are stabilized by hemiprotonated (C±C+) base pairs, even though the crystals were prepared near neutral pH. At neutral pH, cytosine should not be protonated, since the pKa of N3 of cytosine is 4.7. It has been assumed that the pKa for cytosine in this environment is raised at least to 7 in order to stabilize the structure with three hydrogen bonds (Inman, 1964; Kang et al., 1995). Raman spectra indicate that the quadruples of the d(CCCT) crystal structure are conserved in aqueous solution (Benevides et al., 1996). The C-rich strand is also additionally stabilized by hydrogen-bonding networks of Watson±Crick base pairing as well as non-Watson±Crick base pairing of adenine±adenine, thymine±thymine and adenine±thymine base pairs, which occur between the ¯anking non-cytosine bases of the telomeric DNA sequences (Kang et al., 1994, 1995; Berger et al., 1995). The crystal structure of d(TAACCC) has revealed that it utilizes the sequence TAA at the ends to form a novel loop in which the 5H end of one molecule is in close proximity to the 3H end of another molecule (Kang et al., 1995). This loop at the end of the C-quartet is stabilized by three interactions: (i) the ®rst T forms a hydrogen bond to the third A in a Hoogsteen base pair, (ii) the loop is stabilized by stacking interactions and (iii) in addition, the phosphate group between the second A and the third A is stabilized by a hydrogen-bonded interaction with the N4 amino group of cytosine. All of these interactions combine to form a very tight loop involving a TAA sequence at the 5H end of the molecule. This C-strand telomere structure strongly suggests that the loop may provide a mechanism for stabilizing the interaction of two pairs of C-strand repeats. The presence of a stable loop associated with the four-stranded cytosine structure reinforces the possibility that conformations of this type may be found in the telomere. The studies on proteins in vivo that bind speci®cally to telomeres in yeast and humans suggest these telomeric DNA super-secondary structures may represent some structural motif for the recognition of enzyme or protein factors (Rhodes & Giraldo, 1995; Blackburn, 1994). It has also been

2. Experimental

Crystals of d(ACCCT) were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method from a solution containing 5 mM d(ACCCT), 5%(v/v) 2-propanol, 10%(v/v) ethanol, 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM spermine. 3. Results and discussion Hexagonal crystals grew slowly over a period of one month In the crystal structure of d(ACCCT), representing a trunand reached a size of 0.3 Â 0.3 Â 0.1 mm. X-ray diffraction cated analog of the C-rich telomeric single-repeat sequence in analysis revealed that the molecule had crystallized in the metazoans, the four strands make up an intercalation motif, in cubic space group I23 with unit-cell parameters Ê which two parallel duplexes form a tetraplex by orienting a = b = c = 93.81 A. The data set was collected on a Rigaku themselves in antiparallel directions (Fig. 2). Each parallel R-AXIS IIC imaging plate by the ¯ash-freezing method duplex exhibits a slight right-handed twist of about 14.5 . (103 K; crystal-to-detector distance of 100 mm). The ®nal Rsym value was 5%, generating 3679 unique re¯ections above the 1' Inspection of the central portion of the molecule reveals a ¯at level and 2643 re¯ections above the 2' level in the resolution lath-like structure with two broad and two narrow grooves, Ê range 15.0±2.4 A. The molecular-replaceÈ ment method X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) was used to attempt to solve the structure of d(ACCCT), using a part of the crystal structure of d(CCCT) (Kang et al., 1994) as a starting model. Initially, a crossÊ rotational search with 15±3.0 A data produced more than 89 unique orientations, whose rotation-function (RF) values ranged from 0.27 to 0.23. 16 independent solution sets were left after a subsequent Patterson correlation stage Ê using data in the 12.0±2.4 A resolution range. After translational searches with these various orientations using 2175 Ê re¯ections from 15.0 to 3.0 A resolution, a unique position for four-stranded d(CCC) which contained no symmetry overlap was generated. The molecular position of this solution in the lattice showed that the helical axis was not oriented along any axis of the unit cell, which was consistent with the self-rotation search. Initial rigidbody re®nement was carried out using 2636 re¯ections from data in the resoluÊ tion range 15.0±2.5 A and produced an R value of 41%. After several cycles of positional re®nement, temperature-factor re®nement and simulated-annealed omitmap calculation, we were able to ®t the remaining seven residues to the electron Figure 2 density.

which is similar to the i-motif parts of other C-rich strand crystal structures, with the exceptions of d(CCCC) (Chen et al., 1994) and d(TCCCCC) (Gehring et al., 1993; Fig. 1). The mean distance between phosphates in the narrow grooves is Ê Ê 8.1 (1.5) A and is 15.0 (1.7) A in the broad grooves (Table 1). The distance between phosphate groups in the two narrow grooves and one of the broad grooves varies in an alternating pattern. This asymmetry is seen most clearly in Figs. 1(a)±1(d). In the ®rst row of Fig. 1, two continuous layers of C±C+ base pairs in ®ve different crystal structures and one NMR structure are shown. In molecules (a), (b), (c) and (d), the two strands at the right-hand side of the molecules are relatively ¯at, while the strands at the left-hand side have curved conformations owing to the fact that the phosphate groups are rotated away from the ¯atter strands. This asymmetric structure of sugar±phosphate backbones is not visible in the structures of d(CCCC) and d(TCCCCC). The core part of this [d(ACCCT)]4 molecule is much more compact than its B-DNA counterpart, and the central four layers of cytosines (C22±C32, C13±C3, C23±C33, C2±C12) are very planar, the average distance between consecutive planes of Ê cytosine base pairs averaging 3.0 A (Fig. 2a). However, the two outer layers of cytosine base pairs (C4± C14, C24±C34) are propellertwisted with respect to each other by the rotation of the cytosine base pairs around the C1H ÐN1H bond. There is an average twist angle of 11 seen in these two layers and these terminal cytosine base pairs (C4±C14, C24±C34) have adjacent cytosine bases (C22±C32, C2±C12, Ê respectively) at a distance of 3.2 A and adjacent non-cytosine bases at Ê a distance of 3.4 A (Fig. 2a). The hydration pattern of d(ACCCT) resembles those of d(CCCT) and d(CCCAAT), but is more evenly hydrated. In this d(ACCCT) crystal structure, all cytosines have their N4 amino group hydrogen bonded to a water molecule, which bridges to a neighboring phosphate's oxygen in turn directly or through a second water molecule (Fig. 3). All the cytosine residues of d(ACCCT) have glycosidic bonds in the anti conformation (Fig. 2) and most of the cytosine sugars puckering. exhibit C3H -endo Raman spectra of d(CCCT) indicate that the C3H -endo deoxynucleotides are conserved in aqueous solution (Benevides et al., 1996), despite the fact that the C3H endo conformation is rarely encountered for aqueous DNA molecules. In the case of previously examined crystal structures, C3H endo nucleoside conformers are invariably converted in solution to Figure 2 (continued) the more energetically favorable (b) Schematic diagram of the four-stranded d(ACCCT) molecule in two different orientations, showing a C2H -endo conformation (Benevides narrow groove (A) and broad groove (B).

and thymidines that are located at the periphery of the molecule exhibit variability in sugar puckering and base conformation (Fig. 2). This degree of variation might be a consequence of their involvement in intramolecular and intermolecular stabilization.

The main body of the molecule is extended beyond the C± C+ base pairs by adding adenine and thymidine residues. At the bottom and top, the four chains organized by the three cytosines in each strand are stacked by either a base pair or a base triple, respectively (Fig. 2). Adenine residue A31 and thymidine residue T15 form a Watson±Crick base pair, which is stacked upon the cytosine C±C+ base pair (C4±C22). The A21 base is stacked upon this A±T base pair. This particular local structure of two adenines and one thymine has been observed in the crystal structure of d(TAACCC) (Kang et al., 1995). Based upon the formation of a very tight loop by two adenines and one thymine in the crystal structure of d(TAACCC), it has been proposed that the C-rich telomeres have the potential to stably interact and thus to recognize another C-strand telomere sequence (Kang et al., 1995; Ahmed et al., 1994). The observation of the same type of interactions between two adenines and one thymine in the crystal structure of d(ACCCT), despite a different crystal system and sequence, provides further evidence for the in vivo existence of this type of interaction between two pairs of Cstrand. Adenine residue A21 also plays an essential role in building the lattice, together with thymidine 35 (Fig. 2a). This A21 and a symmetry-related T35 curve back to the molecule where they form a reverse Hoogsteen base pair, which is stacked on top of the Watson±Crick A21±T15 base pair forming a continuous helical axis in the crystal lattice. Of particular interest is the base triple formed between adenine 1 (A1), adenine 11 (A11) and thymine 25 (T25) at the

Three hydrogen bonds are shown between cytosine residues of the central C±C+ base pair. All the cytosine bases have their N4 amino group hydrogen bonded to a water molecule. Hydrogen bonds are formed between T15 and A31 in a Watson±Crick pairing. This ®gure was produced using O (Jones et al., 1991).

top of the molecule (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). A1 and A11 are contributed from a parallel-stranded duplex and T25 belongs to the oppositely oriented strand. Two hydrogen bonds are formed between A1 and T25 in a reverse Hoogsteen base pairing and another two hydrogen bonds are formed between A1 and A11 in an asymmetric homo-purine pattern (Fig. 3, Fig. 4a). This adenine±adenine±thymine (A±A±T) base triple has previously been reported in the crystal structure of the hexamer d(CCCAAT), in which the respective A±A±T base triples are formed between symmetry-related molecules, in contrast to the intramolecular A±A±T base triple of this d(ACCCT) structure. Another type of intermolecular (A±A± T) base triple has been found in the crystal packing of d(CCCAAT), where a trans adenine±adenine base pair and a reverse Hoogsteen base pair are involved in a base triple (Fig. 4b). A different type of (A±A±T) base triple has also been found in the four-stranded structure of the Bombyx mori single-repeat telomeric DNA sequence, d(TAGG) (Kettani et al., 1997) (Fig. 4c). This d(TAGG) quadruplex contains two adjacent G±G±G±G tetrads sandwiched between two (T±A± A) base triples. The structure, function and application of base triples have been reported in a wide variety of contexts including a potential antisense therapeutic application (Radhakrishnan & Patel, 1994; Frank-Kamenetskii & Mirkin, 1995). However, there is very little information available regarding the

geometry of base triples, particularly the purine±purine± pyrimidine type involving adenines and thymines. Fiber diffraction (Liu et al., 1994) and spectroscopic studies (Radhakrishnan & Patel, 1994; Sklen'ar & Feigon, 1990) have shown three different base triples, A±A±T, G±C±G and T±A± T, which have been reported to be formed by single-stranded oligonucleotides intercalating into the major groove of the duplex DNA. Recently, a model for antiparallel double-stranded DNA has been proposed where the individual steps are base triples rather than base pairs (Kettani et al., 1997; Kuryavyi & Jovin, 1994). The model was put forward to explain the nucleic acid architecture postulated to exist for the expanded trinucleotide repeat sequences which result in the onset of human diseases such as fragile X syndrome (CGG repeats) and myotonic dystrophy (CAG repeats) (Sinden & Wells, 1992). The crystal structure of a peptide nucleic acid (PNA; Nielsen et al., 1991) was also determined in complex with a DNA molecule (Betts et al., 1995), where two base triples, C± G±C and T±A±T, have been shown. In each case, two bases form Watson±Crick base pairs (G±C and A±T) and, subsequently, the Hoogsteen base pairs are found between the remaining bases (C±C and A±T). In the crystal structure of d(ACCCT), the triple base pairing between A±A±T contains no Watson±Crick base-pairing scheme between the adenine and thymine as is seen in the PNA structure. In the PNA structures, the N3 atom of the cytosine in the GCG base triple is protonated and hydrogen bonded to the N7 position of the corresponding guanine. This phenomenon is analogous to the state of the N3 atom of the cytosine base pairs which stabilize the central six layers of the d(ACCCT) structure. The d(ACCCT) and PNA molecules were crystallized at the pH values of 7.0 and 8.5, respectively, while the pKa of the N3 position is 4.7. These are good examples that cytosine pKa can be shifted by the formation of stable structures. The crystal structure of the decamer d(GGCCAATTGG)2 also showed a unique packing arrangement where the terminal guanines of one duplex form Hoogsteen base pairs with the G±C Watson±Crick base pairs of a second duplex in either a parallel or antiparallel fashion (Vlieghe et al., 1996). This G± C±G base triple again demonstrates the bonding motif in triple helices where a Hoogsteen base pair exists. Unlike the purine± purine±pyrimidine base triple of d(ACCCT), the base triple in the d(GGCCAATTGG)2 structure shows that all of the bases involved in triple-base interactions are in the anti conformation relative to their sugars. Even though all the base triples observed are somewhat different from one another, observations of base triples in various DNA structures lend encouragement to the proposal that a triple DNA structure could form for de®ned sequences and could play an important role not only in the formation of triple-stranded complexes but also in the stabilization of various nucleic acid tertiary structures (Berger et al., 1995). In the three crystal structures d(TAACCC), d(CCCT) and d(ACCCT), which represent various sequence repeats or truncated variations of the cytosine-rich strand of metazoan telomeres tandem repeats, the hemiprotonated cytosine base pairs which make up the intercalated portion of these three molecules are very similar. However, the variation occurs at the ends of the molecules, where the various adenine and thymine compositions contribute to different structural conformations. In spite of sequence and crystal-system differences, the adenines and thymines located between the consecutive cytosine repeats serve a vital function in contributing to a super-secondary strand polymorphism. Structural similarity of these non-cytosine residues is also observed in the crystal structures of d(TAACCC) and d(ACCCT). Presently, there is no direct biological evidence that the C-rich strand can exist by itself as can the single-stranded G-rich overhang. However, it is tempting to speculate that the higher order structures observed in these G-rich and/or C-rich DNA, whether intrastrand or interstrand, or a combination of the two in the telomere or in the middle of chromosome, may facilitate many biological phenomena by providing stability in the form of a structural intermediate.
