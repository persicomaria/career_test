ABSTRACT: The three-dimensional solution structure obtained by NMR of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain bound to the vnd/NK-2 consensus 16 bp DNA sequence was determined. This mutation to threonine from alanine in position 35 in helix II of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain is associated with early embryonic lethality in Drosophila melanogaster. Although the unbound mutant protein is not structured, in the DNA-bound state it adopts the three-helix fold characteristic of all known homeodomains, but with alterations relative to the structure of the wild-type analogue. These structural modifications occur, and are accompanied by a 50-fold reduction in the DNA binding affinity, even though most of the proteinDNA interactions originally seen for the wild-type homeodomain are found likewise in the threonine analogue. Alterations include torsional angle changes in the loop between helix I and helix II, and in the turn between helix II and helix III, as well as in a distortion of the usual antiparallel orientation of helix I with respect to helix II. The alteration of the position of leucine 40 in the A35T mutant is proposed to explain the observed 1.27 ppm upfield shift of the corresponding amide proton resonance relative to the value observed for the wild-type analogue. A detailed comparison of the structures of the mutant A35T and wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomains bound to the cognate DNA is presented. The consequences of the structural alteration of the DNA-bound A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 protein may constitute the basis of the observed early embryonic lethality.

The homeobox gene is important in specifying positional information and segmental identity in the commitment of embryonic cells to specific pathways of development (13). Homeobox-containing genes are believed to act as master controlling genes both spatially and temporally. They are known to control genes that are important in the development of various organs such as the heart, thyroid, kidneys, eyes, and prostate in many organisms (4-6). The homeodomain is the highly conserved structural domain of a class of

proteins that are encoded by the homeobox gene and function as regulators of transcription, at least in part, by specifically binding to DNA (7). The ability of the homeodomain to adopt a three-dimensional structure and to properly bind a specific sequence or set of sequences of DNA depends on the nature of the amino acid residues in specific positions within the three-dimensional fold (i.e., the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif) (8). The three-dimensional solution structures of the wild-type vnd/NK-21 homeodomain in the absence of DNA and the homeodomain-DNA complex have been reported previously (9, 10). Structures for other homeodomain-DNA complexes, determined primarily by X-ray cystallography, have been published (11-16). A comparison of these results illustrates the degree of structural similarity among the various homeodomain-DNA complexes. For example, residues in specific positions (i.e., 8, 16, 20, 26, 34, 35, 38, 40, 45, 48, and 49) across all the classical homeodomains typically are hydrophobic and make up the core of the protein. Conserved residues in positions 5, 47, 50, and 51, with few exceptions, make base specific contacts with the DNA. In the case of

Structure of the vnd/NK-2 Homeodomain Bound to DNA the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain, L7 and Y54 also contact the DNA in the minor groove and major groove, respectively, and are responsible for the recognition of the unusual DNA consensus sequence that contains a 5-CAAG-3 sequence as part of the core rather than the canonical 5-TAAT-3 sequence (8). Other residues with positively charged side chains show electrostatic interactions with the DNA and contribute to the binding affinity. Current evidence suggests that changes of even the variable residues in a given homeodomain often result in abnormal development or disease (7). The hypothesis is that any amino acid residue change that alters the structure of any particular homeodomain or its interaction with its DNA in the proper functional context can result in genetic disease or cause disruption of normal development. Various genetic diseases and developmental abnormalities have been mapped to numerous single-base mutations in the homeobox for numerous species, including humans, where these mutations often translate to single amino acid residue replacements in the homeodomain (17, 18). Such singleresidue replacements can result in a structural change in the homeodomain, a modification of the physical properties such as the "melting" temperature, or an alteration in the affinity and target specificity for the DNA (19-21). The relationship between these changes and the resulting implication for the understanding of alterations in transcriptional control is of considerable current interest. The characterization of a number of vnd mutant alleles that produce transcriptional defects in early embryogenesis and result in embryonic lethality has been reported (22). One of these lethal vnd mutants was shown to encode the homeodomain protein with a single amino acid residue substitution in position 35 of the homeodomain, where alanine is replaced with threonine. Under conditions where the wild-type homeodomain is folded, the alanine side chain is partially surface exposed (9, 10). Furthermore, only alanine and serine are found at position 35 in functional homeodomains (7). The absence of threonine at position 35 in any of the many homeodomains that have been found thus far suggests that its presence in that position is functionally detrimental. The question of the relation between the structure or the physical properties of the mutant homeodomain and improper transcriptional regulation thus arises. It was shown recently that the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain is unable to adopt a folded three-dimensional structure free in solution (20). The affinity of this mutant homeodomain for the consensus vnd/NK-2 target DNA, which contains the 5-CAAGTG-3 site, is reduced by a factor of 50 relative to that of the wild-type analogue (20). This reduction in binding affinity occurs even though in the structure of the wild-type homeodomain, the side chain of the residue in position 35 is partially surface exposed and does not contact the DNA. As a further examination of the structural implications of the placement of threonine in position 35, we describe the three-dimensional structure of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain in its DNA-bound form.

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 43, 2003 12523 directed mutation, expression from the pET-15b vector in Escherichia coli, and purification of an 80-amino acid residue protein that encompasses the A35T vnd/NK-2 homeodomain were carried out as described previously (20). The singly 15 N-labeled protein was expressed in Martek Biosciences Corp. 9-N medium and the doubly 15N- and 13C-labeled protein in Martek 9-CN medium. The purification process is same as that for the unlabeled protein described previously, and involves loading the crude fraction on a Ni2+ affinity column. Both preparations were further purified by reversephase HPLC. The purity of the protein was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, as well as by mass spectroscopy (37) and NMR. The 15N and 13C enrichment of the uniformly labeled proteins was found to be 96.4% by mass spectroscopy. A yield of 13 mg of purified protein from 1 L of the medium was obtained. The preparation of the A35T vnd/NK-2-DNA complex was reported previously (20). Both 16-mer DNA single strands (5-ACAGCCACTTGACACA-3 and 5-TGTGTCAAGTGGCTGT-3) containing the vnd/NK-2 target site were synthesized and purified by Midland Certified Reagent Co. The two single-strand segments were annealed following initial heating to 95 °C to form the double-strand DNA. The protein was then titrated slowly into the DNA solution to form the mutant homeodomain-DNA complex. The DNA: protein stoichiometry was adjusted to be 1:0.9 to ensure that all of the protein is bound to the unlabeled DNA. The pH of the samples was adjusted to 6.8. The concentration of all samples was 0.7 mM. Three separate samples were prepared in Shigemi NMR tubes containing sample volumes adjusted to 250 µL, two containing the uniformly doubly 15 N- and 13C-labeled mutant homeodomain in 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O and in 100% 2H2O, and one sample containing the uniformly 15N-labeled mutant homeodomain in 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O. NMR Spectroscopy. All measurements were performed at 35 °C on a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance probe and a single z-axis gradient amplifier. Gradient pulses were generated using a home-built gradient amplifier. All pulse experiments were implemented with pulse field gradients for coherence selection, and suppression of the strong water signal was accomplished using WATERGATE (38). Except when specified otherwise, all experiments were carried out on a 0.7 mM sample of either the uniformly singly 15N- or doubly 15N- and 13C-labeled vnd/ NK-2 homeodomain dissolved in 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O. The concentration was restricted to 0.7 mM because of the limited solubility of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain-DNA complex. A two-dimensional (2D) 15N HSQC spectrum and the triple-resonance three-dimensional (3D) CBCANH and CBCA(CO)NH spectra were used to obtain the sequence specific chemical shift assignments for the backbone amide nitrogen and amide proton resonances (39, 40) as well as those of the R- and -carbon atoms (41). The spectral parameters for the HSQC experiment were as follows: 128* (t1) × 512* (t2) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 1848.4 Hz in F1 (69.2 ms) and 9090.9 Hz in F2 (56.3 ms), with States quadrature detection in the t1 dimension. For the 3D CBCANH experiment, the spectral parameters were as follows: 52* (t1) × 20* (t2) × 512* (t3) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 8445.9 Hz in F1 (6.2 ms), 1849.1 Hz in F2 (10.8 ms), and 9090.9

For the 3D CBCA(CO)NH experiments, the parameters were the same except that the width in F2 was 3698.2 Hz (5.4 ms). A 3D HBHA(CO)NH experiment was used for the chemical shift assignments of the R- and -proton resonances (42). The spectral parameters were as follows: 49* (t1) × 20* (t2) × 384* (t3) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 3759.4 Hz in F1 (13.0 ms), 1855.3 Hz in F2 (10.8 ms), and 9090.9 Hz in F3 (42.2 ms), with States quadrature detection in the t1 and t2 dimensions. The remaining side chain carbon and proton assignments were obtained with a 3D HCCHTOCSY experiment on a 0.7 mM sample of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain dissolved in 100% 2H2O (43). The spectral parameters were as follows: 64* (t1) × 24* (t2) × 384* (t3) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 4000.0 Hz in F1 (16.0 ms), 3018 Hz in F2 (8.0 ms), and 6024.1 Hz in F3 (63.7 ms), with States quadrature detection in the t1 and t2 dimensions. A 3D HNHA experiment was carried out to determine the 3JHNHR coupling constants (44). The spectral parameters were as follows: 47* (t1) × 64* (t2) × 512* (t3) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 1231.5 Hz in F1 (38.2 ms), 4166.7 Hz in F2 (15.4 ms), and 9090.9 Hz in F3 (56.3 ms), with States quadrature detection in the t1 and t2 dimensions. A four-dimensional (4D) 15N-13Cedited HMQC-NOESY-HSQC experiment was carried out to obtain some of the distance restraints and to resolve ambiguities in some of the resonance assignments obtained above (45). The spectral parameters were as follows: 16* (t1) × 50* (t2) × 24* (t3) × 512* (t4) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 3017.5 Hz in F1 (5.3 ms), 5399.6 Hz in F2 (9.3 ms), 1582.3 Hz in F3 (15.2 ms), and 9090.9 Hz in F4 (56.3 ms), with States quadrature detection in the t1, t2, and t3 dimensions. A 15N-edited 3D NOESYHSQC experiment with water flipback was carried out to obtain additional backbone distance restraints from weak cross-peaks and to observe cross-peaks to DNA (24). The spectral parameters were as follows: 128* (t1) × 32* (t2) × 512* (t3) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 5700.0 Hz in F1 (22.5 ms), 1520.5 Hz in F2 (21.0 ms), and 8333.3 Hz in F3 (61.4 ms), with States-TPPI quadrature detection in the t1 and t2 dimensions. To obtain primarily side chain distance restraints, a 4D 13C-13C-edited HMQCNOESY-HSQC spectrum was recorded (46). The spectral parameters were as follows: 16* (t1) × 64* (t2) × 16* (t3) × 256* (t4) data points and spectral widths (acquisition times) of 3125.0 Hz in F1 (5.1 ms), 5263.2 Hz in F2 (12.2 ms), 3125.0 Hz in F3 (5.1 ms), and 6024.1 Hz in F4 (42.5 ms), with States quadrature detection in the t1, t2, and t3 dimensions. For all NOESY experiments, the mixing time (mix) was 100 ms. Cross-Peak Intensity and Distance Restraints. Calibration of the NOESY cross-peak intensities was accomplished using the amide proton distances of residues in well-defined helical segments and the known distance between H 1 and H2 of W48 (25). Distances between backbone amide protons and other protein protons were determined from the 4D 15N13 C-edited HMQC-NOESY-HSQC and the 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HMQC experiments (mix ) 100 ms). Distances between protons attached to 13C were obtained from the 4D 13 C-edited HMQC-NOESY-HSQC experiment. For the 13Cedited spectrum, cross-peak intensities of geminal methylene

protons were calibrated using the corresponding fixed distances defined by the covalent geometry. Log-log fits to the cross-peak intensities were performed to judge consistency, as described previously (9). From these crosspeak intensities, a continuous set of interproton distance restraints was generated. The strategy employed here differs somewhat from that used for the determination of the structure of the wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomain-DNA complex (9). Because of the low solubility of the complex, the majority of protein-DNA cross-peaks could not be observed. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe with linear prediction in the t1 dimension for 2D spectra, in the t1 and t2 dimensions for 3D spectra, and in the t1-t3 dimensions for the 4D spectrum (47). NMRDraw and the pick picking program PIPP (47-49) were used on Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 and Octane workstations to aid cross-peak assignments of the 3D and 4D spectra. The program PROCHECK was used to analyze the structure statistics (50, 51). Structural Statistics. NOESY-derived distance restraints with and without protein backbone dihedral angle restraints obtained from the 3JHNHR scalar couplings were used in the structure determinations. Also, for purposes of comparison, analogous computations using XPLOR 3.851 were carried out on the wild-type DNA-bound vnd/NK-2 homeodomain using the previously derived intraprotein distance, hydrogen bond, and dihedral angle restraints (9). Initially, 100 structures of the A35T mutant and the wild-type DNA-bound vnd/ NK-2 homeodomain were embedded by distance geometry with the DGSA module of XPLOR using only the NOESYderived distance restraints. Following the accepted procedures using XPLOR, these 100 structures were heated to 2000 K, followed by simulated annealing in 1000 steps of 0.003 ps (28). At this point, the 100 generated structures were subjected to preliminary refinement. A ramped asymmetric asymptotic soft potential function was used initially to avoid large forces associated with any significant NOE violations (29). A standard protocol was followed where, in each example, the 20 lowest-energy structures from the various sets of 100 structures then were chosen and subjected to heating to 3000 K, followed by simulated annealing (again using the DGSA module of XPLOR). In addition to the 1146 distance restraints for the A35T mutant homeodomain, structure refinements were carried out and the results compared with and without the experimental  dihedral angle restraints for the structured region. In some cases, additional structural refinements were carried out to ensure that sets of structures were obtained with distance restraint violations of <0.3 Å and dihedral angle violations of <5° (28). These structures were retained and used for statistical analysis (Table 2). As a check on the quality of the final sets of structures for the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain,

a Only 43 dihedral restraints for the helix regions were used in the structure calculation. b Result of X-PLOR refinement. c The rmsds and PROCHECK results were calculated for residues 8-52. The N- and C-terminal parts of the protein are not well-defined because of the lack of long-range distance restraints. Values for the wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomain are given in parentheses. The ensembles of the 20 lowestenergy structures for both the A35T mutant and the wild-type homeodomain were used in the calculation. The values for the rmsd from the mean structures are to be compared with 0.49 and 0.89 Å, respectively, values obtained for the wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomain (10) in the absence of DNA.

comparisons were made for structures computed without the dihedral angle restraints for the loop region between helix I and helix II and for the turn region between helix II and helix III. No significant differences were observed for structures determined without the dihedral angle restraints, although, as expected, the rmsd values increased slightly. Furthermore, the unusual positive  angle for residue R39 in other homeodomains is maintained for the A35T mutant even without dihedral angle restraints. The distance restraint that appears to be most critical for the positive  angle for residue R39 is the one between the amide protons of residues L37 and R39. On the basis of the experimental restraints, the mutant homeodomain is well-ordered with rmsd values about the mean coordinate, for residues from F8 through H52, of 0.50 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.19 Å for all heavy atoms. The corresponding XPLOR structure calculations for the wild-type homeodomain gave rmsd values of 0.33 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.96 Å for all heavy atoms [to be compared with values of 0.32 and 0.81 Å, respectively, for the wild type calculated simultaneously with the DNA (9)]. The absence of reliable restraints (due to low solubility) between both the N-terminal arm (residues 1-9 of the homeodomain) and the C-terminal portion of helix III (residues 53-60 of the homeodomain) with the DNA limited our ability to define the structure of these parts of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain. The results obtained for the well-ordered region of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain bound to DNA were used to generate the rms deviations reported in Table 2. MD Simulations. Simulations were carried out using the InsightII/Discover (2.9.5) program package (52) that contains a free energy perturbation method with a consistent valence force field (CVFF) (53). To calculate the total hydration free energy change upon going from the wild-type to the A35T

mutant homeodomain, the FDTI (finite difference thermodynamic integration) method was employed (52). Model structures used to calculate the free energy difference, G°300, were solvated in a 58.0 Å × 45.0 Å × 50.0 Å box of water. RESULTS NMR Spectroscopy. The A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain binds tightly to the vnd/NK-2 DNA consensus sequence but with an affinity that is reduced by a factor of 50 compared to that seen for the wild-type analogue (Kd ) 2 × 10-10 M) (20, 23). The sequence of the 80-amino acid residue protein that was used in this study and that encompasses the homeodomain is shown in Figure 1. Highfield proton resonances above 0.6 ppm (spectra not shown) that are characteristic for the formation of a hydrophobic core are observed (20). The positions of these resonances are quite similar to those found for the wild-type DNA-bound homeodomain. The backbone sequential resonance assignments are complete except for the N-terminal glycine residue. Some of the faster exchanging side chain amine proton resonances could not be assigned. Overall, the chemical shifts of 95% of the side chain resonances have been assigned unambiguously. Many of the chemical shifts, 15N, 13C, and 1H, of the A35T mutant homeodomain (pH 6.8) correspond quite well to those of the wild-type DNA-bound protein (9). In particular, this similarity in chemical shifts holds for those resonances whose side chains were shown to contact the DNA in the wildtype analogue. Four NOESY cross-peaks originating from the side chain NH2 resonances of N51 (Figure 2) and R5 (data not shown) are seen at frequencies essentially identical

to those found for the wild-type vnd/NK-2 with the DNA, i.e., one from the amide NH2 of N51 with A3H8 and three from the guanidinium NH and NH2 of R5, two of which are with A1H2 and one of which is with C2H3. The invariant N51 residue makes a critical adenine base contact in all of the reported structures of the homeodomains (8), and on the basis of analogous chemical shifts, this contact with DNA in the A35T mutant homeodomain is maintained. The amide shifts were obtained using a 15N-edited 3D NOESY-HSQC experiment with water flipback that optimizes cross-peaks from resonances involving exchangeable protons (24). Proton chemical shifts for resonances of side chains that make base specific contacts with the DNA were compared between the wild-type and A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomains in the bound state, i.e., those of R5, L7, Y25, I47, Q50, N51, and Y54. The side chain shift differences here are less than 0.1 ppm, thus indicating similar protein-DNA contacts in both cases. Notable shift differences between the wild-type and mutant homeodomain in the DNA-bound state are seen for the backbone amide proton resonances of I38, L40, V45, and Q50. In the mutant homeodomain, the resonance for L40 is shifted upfield by 1.27 ppm (Figure 3), whereas those for I38, V45, and Q50 are shifted downfield by 0.2-0.5 ppm (20). The HR resonances of the A35T mutant homeodomain all are within 0.3 ppm of the wild-type values with the exception of that of Q23, which is shifted upfield by 0.70 ppm. The only significant changes in backbone 15N reso-

nances were for S36, which is shifted downfield by 5.50 ppm, and for L40, which is shifted upfield by 1.0 ppm relative to that of the wild-type homeodomain. All of the backbone CR resonances for the A35T mutant are within 0.5 ppm of the corresponding wild-type values, with the exception of that of T35. An important use of the chemical shift comparisons is to confirm structural differences found between the wild-type and mutant homeodomains. The procedure used for the NOESY cross-peak intensitydistance calibration is described in Materials and Methods. For the structure calculations, a total of 1146 intraprotein distance restraints were obtained from the various NOESY experiments. This number is to be compared with 1591 upper bound intraprotein distance restraints obtained for the wildtype vnd/NK-2 homeodomain bound to DNA (9). The primary reason there are fewer restraints is the lower sensitivity due to the limited solubility of the mutant proteinDNA complex (0.7 mM). In addition to these distance restraints, 51 of the 72 available 3JHNHR scalar couplings were converted into  torsion angle restraints (from a 3D HNHA experiment) and used in the structure determination. The only significant differences in the  torsion angle restraints (i.e., 3 JHNHR) between the wild-type and A35T mutant homeodomain were observed for residues Y25, L26, S27, and A28 in the loop region between helix I and helix II and for T41 in the turn between helix II and helix III (see Table 1).

i + 3), the backbone 3JHNHR coupling constants, and 13CR chemical shift differences relative to the standard random coil values are shown in Figure 1 (25-27). These results demonstrate the presence of three helical segments that is characteristic for the homeodomains (7) when the mutant homeodomain is bound to DNA. The presence of the three helical segments in the DNA-bound state contrasts with the inability of the mutant homeodomain to adopt a folded conformation free in solution (20). Some differences in intraprotein NOE cross-peaks were observed between the wild-type and mutant homeodomains. For example, the cross-peak from one of the N51 amide NH2 protons to Trp48 HR is clearly observable in the spectrum of the A35T mutant-DNA complex, but can only be seen at a threshold much lower than that shown in the spectrum of the wild-type homeodomain-DNA complex (Figure 2). Another example is that of the cross-peak of the L40 amide proton with the 2 proton of R39, which is clearly observable in the spectrum of the wild-type analogue, but only barely visible at a significantly lower threshold in the spectrum of the mutant homeodomain-DNA complex (Figure 3). Figure 4 shows a stereoview of the superimposition of the ensemble of 20 accepted low-energy structures. In analogy with the wild-type vnd/NK-2 (9, 10) and other known homeodomains (11-16, 30-32), the structure of the A35T mutant contains three helices. The loop between helix I and helix II is somewhat flexible, and there is a turn between helix II and helix III. The similarities of the side chain chemical shifts of the A35T mutant compared to the wildtype homeodomain for the residues in the N-terminal arm and in the region from P42 to T56 suggest that helix III and the N-terminal arm are inserted into the major and minor grooves of the DNA, respectively, which is analogous to other reported homeodomain-DNA structures (9). The C-terminal portion of helix III for the A35T mutant is not as well defined as that of the wild type in the DNA-bound state, presumably because of the lack of protein-DNA restraints rather than to any inherent mobility.

The PROCHECK program was used to assess the quality of the structure of the A35T mutant. In addition, comparison was made with the wild-type homeodomain, where both structures were determined using XPLOR (Table 2). The property comparisons for the A35T mutant and the wildtype homeodomains were quite similar, which is an indication that the qualities of the structures of the A35T mutant and wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomains are comparable. Structural Analysis. Figure 1 shows the backbone J coupling 3JHNHR, the dRN(i, i + 3) and dR (i, i + 3) distance restraints, and a histogram of the backbone 13CR chemical shift differences (from random coil values) characteristic of protein secondary structures (25-27). The three helices are the same in position and are as long as those seen in the wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomain bound to DNA (9). Both the N-terminal region and the C-terminal portion after helix III exhibit no discernible secondary structure. These regions do not show many long-range NOE restraints, and their 13CR chemical shifts are close to the canonical random coil values (33). The backbone rmsd values between the average structures of residues F8-H52 of the wild-type and mutant homeodomains is 1.13 Å. Other comparisons between the A35T mutant and the wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomain were generated by superposition of residues K10-R21 of helix I or simultaneously of residues K10-R21 and K46-H52 of helix I and helix III, respectively. Figure 5 shows a comparison of the average structures of both the A35T mutant and the wild-type vnd/NK-2 homeodomains bound to DNA with superposition of residues K10-R21. The major local distortions between the A35T mutant and the wildtype homeodomains are found in the loop region between helix I and helix II and in the turn between helix II and helix III. Use of either superposition gave for residues Y25-A28 of the A35T mutant and wild-type structures backbone pairwise distances between the two structures of 2.06-3.16 Å. In addition, the structural distortions in the loop region result in larger distances with helix III for the A35T mutant.

The backbones of A35 and T35 in each of the two structures are shown in yellow.

For example, the distance between the Y25 and H52 backbone amide nitrogen atoms is 13.1 Å for the A35T mutant, whereas it is 10.2 Å for the wild-type homeodomain. Solvation energies were calculated and compared for each residue of both proteins using Insight II. Three residues, F20, P29, and L40, exhibited measurable increases in solvation energies. Of these, F20 and L40 exhibited increases of a factor of 2 in hydrophobic surface area. Such an increase in the extent of hydrophobic exposure is supported by the observed lower solubility of the A35T vnd/NK-2 homeodomain-DNA complex in water. The distance between the backbone amide proton of L40 and the amide oxygen of I38 is 2.77 Å, whereas for the wildtype homeodomain, this distance is 3.35 Å. The backbone conformation for residues I38-L40 in the A35T mutant resembles a -turn (34), in contrast to the conformation of the turn region for the wild-type homeodomain (9). The presence of a second amide oxygen atom so close to the L40 amide proton in the A35T mutant homeodomain is consistent with and may provide a partial explanation for the large upfield shift (1.27 ppm) seen for the backbone amide proton of L40 in the A35T mutant relative to that of the wild-type homeodomain (20). In addition, the distance between the amide oxygen of residue 35 and the amide proton of residue 40 is 2.98 Å in the A35T mutant, whereas the corresponding distance is 2.48 Å in the wild-type homeodomain and is consistent with other (i, i - 5) hydrogen bonds found in the turn regions of other homeodomains. The distance of 2.98 Å for the A35T mutant is at the upper limit for hydrogen bonds typically found in proteins (35). The relative orientation of helix II (with respect to both helix I and helix III) in the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 differs significantly from that found for the wild-type vnd/NK-2. Figure 5 highlights the relative orientation difference (15°)

of helix II between the A35T mutant and wild-type vnd/ NK-2. The origin of this structural distortion seems, at least in part, to be a result of the steric packing due to the presence of the larger threonine side chain. Here the side chain methyl group of threonine appears to be in a similar position (Figure 6) in the hydrophobic core of the protein (i.e., the hydroxyl group points toward the surface of the protein) as the alanine methyl group in the case of the wild-type analogue. The net effect of the A35T mutation is to "push" or distort the C-terminal end of helix II away from helix I without significantly changing the structure of helix II. We found it surprising to see these distortions rather than to have this steric crowding compensated by small structural adjustments throughout helix II. A plausible hypothesis to explain the distortion of the axis of helix I relative to that of helix II is that the loop region between the two helices is sufficiently flexible to act as a hinge. The changes in 3JHNHR (Table 1) and thus changes in the  angles support this hypothesis. The orientation of helix III is also rotated slightly (less than 10°), increasing the distance between the C-terminal portion of the helix and the loop region. The hydrophobic core residue contacts from both the N-terminal portion of helix III (residues V45, W48, and F49) and the C-terminal portion (T56) are maintained, however, with this slight rotation apparently being compensated by a gradual bend occurring around residues 50-52. A gradual bend, rather than a more abrupt change, would be consistent with the observed values of 3JHNHR, which are practically unchanged in the mutant. Inherent in this bend might be differences in hydrogen bond lengths and angles that could explain some of the changes in backbone chemical shifts (35) seen in helix III of the A35T mutant, such as the 0.5 ppm change for the amide proton of Q50 (20). The packing of the hydrophobic core of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain is similar to that found for the wild-

Structure of the vnd/NK-2 Homeodomain Bound to DNA type analogue, although the side chains of many of the residues involved in the hydrophobic core of the mutant seem to be displaced slightly relative to their respective backbone positions. This slight displacement appears to be global in nature, rather than involving only residues neighboring T35. One example is the side chain of L26, where the closest distance to the side chain of T35 is 7 Å. Both -methyl groups appear to be in analogous positions relative to the structure of the wild-type homeodomain, even though the backbone atoms of L26 are displaced in the A35T mutant. The -CH3 resonances of L26 have relatively large upfield shifts, almost identical to those in the wild-type homeodomain, thereby indicating that they make up part of the hydrophobic core of both the A35T mutant and the wildtype analogue. It appears that a primary driving force in both the wild-type and A35T mutant homeodomains is the maintenance of the hydrophobic core. To maintain the hydrophobic core of the A35T mutant, there is an overall adjustment of the local side chain structures of the core residues in the mutant at the expense of distorting the backbone of the protein in the loop and turn regions. This backbone distortion is reflected then in the changes of the related backbone  angles (Table 1). DISCUSSION The conformation of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain bound to DNA shows many features that are similar to those of the wild-type vnd/NK-2 and of other homeodomains whose structure have been determined. Analogous orientation of the DNA is supported by the similar observation of cross-peaks between the side chain NH2 resonances of N51 and R5 with the DNA and by very similar side chain chemical shifts (i.e., within 0.1 ppm) for those residues in the wild-type homeodomain that interact with the DNA (9). This evidence thus demonstrates that the wild-type and mutant homeodomains both bind the DNA in a similar way [i.e., the N-terminal arm contacts the DNA in the minor groove and helix III interacts with the DNA in the major groove (9), even though the change in position 35 from A to T resulted in a significant structural distortion]. The affinity of the mutant homeodomain for the same 5CAAGTG-3 consensus DNA sequence is reduced by a factor of 50 compared to that for the wild-type protein (20). This lowered affinity corresponds to a reduction of 2.4 kcal/ mol in the free energy of binding. It is known from calorimetric studies that the values of G°298 for unfolding of the wild-type homeodomain vary from 1.4 to 2.7 kcal/ mol (54), depending on buffer and salt concentration. In an attempt to relate these values of G°298 to the stability of the mutant homeodomain, the difference in the solvation free energies, GS300, between the wild type and A35T mutant was computed using the free energy perturbation module of the Discover program. The value of GS300 was calculated to be as large as 2.6 kcal/mol, with the A35T mutant being less stable than the wild-type homeodomain. Although such computations make numerous assumptions, this result implies that a difference in solvation free energy, even though it is only one component of the total free energy difference, could be sufficient in magnitude to destabilize the folded form of the A35T mutant homeodomain (20) in the absence of compensating factors. While inferring that the calculated value of GS300 can be translated into a corresponding

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 43, 2003 12529 decrease in the G° for unfolding of the mutant homeodomain is attractive, thereby yielding a protein that is unable to fold, nevertheless one is limited to speculation based on the comparable values found for G°298 and GS300 together with the structural similarities observed for both proteins in their respective DNA-bound states. Finally, the question of the affinity of the A35T mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain for its cognate DNA being lower by a factor of 50 (2.4 kcal/mol) arises. Since binding of the A35T mutant to DNA starts from the unstructured homeodomain, one possibility is that the 2.4 kcal/mol reduction represents the energetic costs required to fold the protein before specific binding to DNA. The observed magnitude of G°298 for unfolding of the wild-type homeodomain is in accord with this notion. An alternative explanation is based on the distortion of the structure of the mutant protein. While contacts with the DNA appear to be similar, the distortion could alter longer-range electrostatic forces such as those associated with helix dipole orientation or distances between protein and DNA charged groups. One example of the latter is for R24, where the distance dC -O2P increases from 9.09 Å for the wild type to 11.35 Å for the mutant homeodomain. The three-dimensional structure of and the various distortions in the mutant A35T vnd/NK-2 homeodomain bound to DNA are described. Although the modification involved only position 35, the structural ramifications of this alteration propagated throughout a large segment of the homeodomain. The structural changes observed for the A35T vnd/NK-2 homeodomain when bound to DNA are likely to be important factors related to or causing the early loss of embryonic viability in the mutant allele. Although the cellular events are not yet well understood and the question of degradation by endogenous proteases exists, the idea that a structural modification in the homeodomain would alter the geometry of the full-length protein and thus affect the transcriptional activation process is appealing. Such distortions would be expected to significantly alter protein-protein interactions as well as the lifetime of the transcriptional activation complex, both being necessary for proper regulation of downstream target genes (55). The observation that alanine and serine are the only residues found in functional homeodomains (7) now can be understood in terms of the structural requirements associated with position 35 of the homeodomain. On the basis of our results, we conclude that replacement of alanine or serine with other amino acid residues would result in significant structural distortions. As an example, it has been shown that the presence of valine at position 35 in a mutant homeodomain is strongly correlated with genetic disease (36). Presumably, this mutant homeodomain bound to DNA suffers from structural alterations analogous to those found in the study presented here.
