Translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) is an evolutionarily highly conserved molecule implicated in many processes related to cell cycle progression, proliferation and growth, to the protection against harmful conditions including apoptosis and to the human allergic response. We are showing here that after application of mild oxidative stress, human TCTP relocates from the cytoplasm to the nuclei of HaCaT keratinocytes where it directly associates with the ligand-binding domain of endogenous vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) through its helical domain 2 (AA 71­132). Interestingly, the latter harbours a putative nuclear hormone receptor coregulatory LxxLL-like motif which seems to be involved in the interaction. Moreover, we demonstrate that VDR transcriptionally induces the expression of TCTP by binding to a previously unknown VDR response element within the TCTP promotor. Conversely, ectopically overexpressed TCTP downregulates the amount of VDR on both mRNA as well as protein level. These data, to conclude, suggest a kind of feedback regulation between TCTP and VDR to regulate a variety of (Ca2+ dependent) cellular effects and in this way further underscore the physiological relevance of this novel protein­protein interaction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ery associated), fortilin or S. cerevisiae MMI1 (microtubule and mitochondria interacting), is a small but multifunctional highly conserved eukaryotic protein [1]. To list a few current concepts concerning its principal physiological properties, TCTP (indirectly) binds to microtubules in a cell-cycle dependent manner and is detached from the mitotic spindle upon the meta- to anaphase transition, thereby promoting an increase in cytoskeletal dynamics [2­4]. Additional studies implicate an involvement of TCTP in ribosome functions and especially in the elongation step of protein translation through its interaction with both eEF1A and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eEF1 [5,6]. Strikingly, TCTP is also involved in the prevention of cell death by modulating the anti-apoptotic activity of the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 [7,8], by interacting with Bcl-xL [9], by antagonizing Bax function [10], or by scavenging elevated Ca2+ levels within the cytosol [11]. In higher organisms which have the ability to mount an adaptive immune response, TCTP in addition displays more general cytokine-like activities and par-

ticipates in the late phase of allergic inflammatory processes [12,13]. By screening a keratinocyte cDNA library to elucidate in more detail the molecular environment of TCTP in human skin cells, we uncovered that the anti-apoptotic, Ca2+ diminishing TCTP [14­16] specifically interacts with the proapoptotic, Ca2+ increasing vitamin D3 receptor (VDR). The latter represents a transcription factor that after binding the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, predominantly heterodimerizes with the retinoid-X receptor (RXR) and modulates gene expression by binding to so-called vitamin D response elements (VDREs) located within the respective promoter region [17,18]. In this way, VDR is responsible for mediating the pleiotropic and in part cell-type specific effects of calcitriol on bone development and maintenance, mineral homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation, immune response modulation or vitamin D metabolism as reviewed elsewhere [19­23]. In brief, our results demonstrate a direct and ­ at least in vitro ­ calcitriol-strengthened association of human TCTP domain 2 carrying a speculative LxxLLlike motif with the VDR ligand-binding domain (LBD, AA 197­427). Nevertheless, TCTP does actually not symbolize a classical nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) coactivatory protein. TCTP per se does not embody a calcitriol-inducible target gene, but ectopically introduced VDR transcriptionally induces the enhanced expression of TCTP by a TCTP-independent binding to a VDRE within the promotor of the latter. On the other hand, TCTP upon its overexpression in HaCaT keratinocytes has the capacity to significantly downregulate the amount of VDR on both mRNA as well as protein level. Our observations hence, hypothetically, point to an involvement of this to date unidentified protein­protein interaction (PPI) in regulating or perhaps even controlling keratinocyte growth, differentiation and notably survival. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Reagents Chemicals were bought from Sigma­Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany, or Applichem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany. Components of the Y2H system were acquired from BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA, enzymes from Fermentas Life Sciences GmbH, St. LeonRot, Germany, and sequencing reagents from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA. EpiLife® was obtained from Cascade Biologics/Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany, Blasticidin S from InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA. Primers were synthesized by MWGBiotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany. pHIS-parallel 2 and pGST-parallel 2 were a kind gift from Peter Sheffield [24]. Mono- and polyclonal anti-TCTP antibodies were purchased from MBL International Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA and BD Biosciences, Le Pont-de-Claix, France, anti-VDR, anti-RXR, anti-annexin, anti-Keratin 14, anti-cmyc as well as AP-labelled secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany, Penta-HISTM antibody from Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany, and anti-GST antibody from GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden. 2.2. Screening of a keratinocyte cDNA library with human TCTP as bait The 519 bp sequence encoding human TCTP was subcloned in frame with the GAL4 BD into pGBKT7 as specified in Table 1. A cDNA library derived from human keratinocytes was cloned in the GAL4 AD vector pGADT7 (4,128 × 106 independent transformants) as described before [25]. For the Y2H screening that was conducted with the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3, bait and prey plasmids were co-transformed into the haploid yeast strain AH109 and plated on SD-trp-leu-ade-his synthetic medium

where tryptophane and leucine represent auxotrophic selection markers and ADE2/HIS3 select for actual reporter activity. Library inserts from primary positive clones were recovered via a digestion with 10U lyticase, the addition of 10% SDS, one freeze/thaw cycle and a clearance of the obtained supernatant via the Wizard® SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Plasmids were amplified in E. coli DH5 and isolated from the latter using the GenEluteTM Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma­Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). Next, they were reintroduced back into AH109 together with the bait or empty pGBKT7 and retested on SD-trp-leu-adehis+1mM 3-AT (3-aminotriazole, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product that suppresses the background growth of falsepositives to a large extent) to verify their reporter activity once more before their sequence was determined. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted through the basic local alignment search tool BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), the ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://www.expasy.ch/) and the SWISS-PROT protein knowledgebase (http://expasy.org/sprot/). Only candidates passing control experiments were subjected to further analyses. 2.3. Mapping of the interacting domains between TCTP and VDR By subcloning human TCTP and yeast MMI1 into pGADT7 to express proteins joined to AA 768­881 of the GAL4 AD and by fusing VDR to AA 1­147 of the GAL4 DB, we switched the BD to AD fusion proteins and vice versa to re-evaluate our findings. In consideration of the overall three-dimensional human TCTP protein structure, the fragments encoding AA 1­70, 71­132 and 133­172 were inserted into pGADT7 to identify the definite section involved in the interaction with VDR. Next, the putative LxxLL-like motif identified in TCTP domain 2 (plus 24 nucleotides up- and 36 nucleotides downstream of this sequence) was separately subcloned into pGADT7. A mutated sequence replacing the supposed LxxLL-like motif of wildtype TCTP by 3 alanines (Ala121 -x-x-Ala124 -Ala125 ) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis annealing two PCR products spanning this region. In parallel, also the 3 VDR domains (AA 22­143, 81­196 and 197­427) were individually subcloned into pGBKT7 to retest their Y2H interaction. 2.4. Recombinant protein expression of TCTP and VDR Wildtype human TCTP, full-length TCTP carrying the respective Ala121 -x-x-Ala124 -Ala125 mutation and TCTP domain 2 were each subcloned into the bacterial expression vectors pHIS- and pGST-parallel 2 [24]. After induction with 0.8 mM IPTG at 16  C overnight to start LacZ-promotor mediated target gene expression, HIS-TCTP was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells under native conditions by Chelating Sepharose® Fast Flow affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) in Starting Buffer (50 mM Na2 HPO4 , pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) as described previously [26]. GST-TCTP was isolated from the bacterial lysates by binding to glutathione Sepharose 4B columns (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and recovered from the matrix under non-denaturing conditions in 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). Full-length VDR and the respective VDR domains 1, 2 and 3 were subcloned into the same set of bacterial expression vectors and transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta-gamiTM B. IPTG-induced lysates obtained after the addition of 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 3 consecutive cycles of freezing and thawing prior to shearing genomic DNA by ultrasonication were used for pulldown assays. C-myc tagged VDR (in pGBKT7) was produced according to a standard rabbit reticulocyte protocol (TnT® Quick coupled transcription/translation system, Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

2.5. Pulldown assays via nickel beads and GST sepharose 100 g recombinant HIS-TCTP were incubated with 10 l fulllength GST-VDR lysate or 10 l of the particular VDR domain 1­3 lysates in 500 l Starting Buffer in the absence or presence of 1 M calcitriol for 1 h at RT before HIS-TCTP was captured on nickel beads. In an analogous approach, full-length HIS-TCTP carrying the Ala121 -x-x-Ala124 -Ala125 mutations or TCTP domain 2 were mixed with full-length GST-VDR and treated the same way. In the case of GST-pulldown studies, 100 g GST-TCTP were mixed with 10 l HIS-VDR lysate in 500 l PBS for 1 h before TCTP was finally attached to glutathione sepharose beads. For negative control, the individual VDR lysates were incubated with the relevant empty column material to exclude unspecific binding. After 5 washing steps with Starting Buffer or PBS, TCTP was eluted in either 250 mM

imidazole in Starting Buffer or in 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris­HCl. Samples were analyzed by 13.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by standard Western blotting. Accurate binding of tagged TCTP to the particular beads was analyzed using polyclonal antiTCTP (diluted 1:1000 in 1× blocking buffer composed of 25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween20, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% NaN3 ) and AP-labelled goat-anti-rabbit (1:5000) antibodies. Copurified VDR was detected either via Penta-HISTM (1:3000) and AP-labelled rabbit-anti-mouse (1:5000) or anti-GST (1:2000) and anti-goat IgG (1:5000) antibodies. 2.6. Co-immunoprecipitation studies 30 l c-myc tagged VDR were bound to anti-c-myc antibody coupled beads (IP0020, Sigma­Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany)

together with 150 ng recombinant HIS-TCTP in the presence or absence of 1 M calcitriol in 600 l reaction buffer (provided with the kit) at 4  C with end-to-end rotation for 2 h. As negative control, BSA plus TCTP or TCTP alone were incubated with the empty column material. After 3 extensive washes, the proteins were incubated in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The flowthrough was resolved on a 13.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) for standard IgG immunoblotting. VDR was visualized by staining with biotinylated anti-c-myc antibody (1:10,000) and Streptavidin (1:6000), the co-immunoprecipitated TCTP by incubation with Penta-HISTM and AP-labelled rabbit-anti-mouse (1:5000) antibodies. To co-immunoprecipitate TCTP and VDR from HaCaT cells or, alternatively, from HaCaTs transfected with TCTP-YFP, cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed with 1500 l RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) by freezing at -70  C for 20 min and thawing at RT before genomic DNA was sheared. The obtained lysates were incubated with polyclonal anti-TCTP antibody (1.2 g) or rabbit IgG (1.2 g) overnight at 4  C. 100 l of preblocked protein A/G PLUS agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) were then added for cross-linking the anti-TCTP antibody or the control rabbit IgG to the beads. The mixture was incubated at RT for additional 2 h. The beads were washed in PBS 4 times. The purified and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. TCTP was detected by monoclonal anti-TCTP (1:500) and goat-anti-mouse (1:5000) antibodies, its interaction partner via monoclonal antiVDR (1:1000) and the same secondary antibody. 2.7. Cell culture techniques and transfection of HaCaT keratinocytes pcDNATM 6.2/N-EmGFP/YFP-DEST (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, San Jose, CA, USA) and pcDNATM 3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)Tomato are fluorescent mammalian expression vectors which we used for overexpressing TCTP and VDR in human keratinocytes. N-terminally YFP-tagged TCTP was generated by PCR amplification of its coding region with primers equipped with an attB site, followed by a BP recombination into pDONRTM /Zeo and a transfer into the destination vector pcDNATM 6.2/N-EmGFP/YFP-DEST. C-terminally CFP-tagged VDR was prepared by subcloning the reading frame into pECFP-C1. Red fluorescent VDR was constructed through the insertion of a tomato dimer sequence (amplified from pRSET-B tdTomato) into pcDNATM 3.1D/V5-His-TOPO, followed by the ligation of the VDR coding sequence into the remaining NotI and XbaI restriction sites. The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT [27­29] was maintained as a monolayer culture under a 5% CO2 athmosphere at 37  C in Epilife medium complemented with HKGS (growth supplement), 60 M CaCl2 and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. For transfection experiments, 1­3 × 105 HaCaT cells were seeded to reach approximately 50­80% confluence at the time of transfection and then treated with 2­4 g lipofectamine-complexed DNA for 3 h at 37  C. The uptake of YFP-tagged fusion proteins was selected for by the resistance against 2.5 g/ml Blasticidin S. For double-transfections, HaCaT cells were electroporated via the Cell line Nucleofector® kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Lonza GmbH, Wuppertal, Germany) with a total of 5 g plasmid DNA. 2.8. Subcellular protein fractions Lysates of the 4 subcellular protein fractions cytosol, nucleus, membrane and cytoskeleton were prepared according to the

FractionPREPTM kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA). Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were used for subsequent studies. A Western blot using anti-Annexin (cytosol), anti-Keratin 14 (cytoskeleton) and anti-RXR (nucleus) as subcellular marker antibodies was performed to confirm that the fractions were successfully separated. 2.9. Co-localisation studies via (immune) fluorescence microscopy Exponentially growing HaCaTs transfected with a combination of YFP-TCTP and Tomato-VDR were cultured onto chamber slides, partially treated with H2 O2 (concentration range tested: 250 M3 mM) for 1 h, then rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and counterstained with 1 g/ml 1,4,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI). Coverslips were inverted into mounting medium (MicroTrak ® , Trinity Biotech PLC, Wicklow, Ireland) after 3 washing steps and the immunofluorescence staining evaluated with a Zeiss Axioskop MC100 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). For antibody staining, untransfected HaCaT cells were permeabilised using 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at RT after fixation. Cells were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-TCTP, 1:100, polyclonal anti-VDR, 1:50) diluted in 1% BSA in PBS. Negative control approaches included samples where the primary antibodies were omitted. After 3 washing steps with PBS, coverslips were incubated with Fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:100, TCTP detection) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, VDR detection) for 1 additional hour at RT and processed as described above. 2.10. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements HaCaT cells were co-transfected with CFP-tagged VDR and YFPtagged TCTP and grown on uncoated glass coverslips in 6-well plates for 48 h without selection for blasticidin or neomycin resistance and treated with 1 M calcitriol or 3 mM H2 O2 1 h before analysis. Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion chamber. For all experiments, CFP served as the FRET donor and YFP as the acceptor. Visualization of cells and detection of FRET was performed using a fully automated microscope (iMICTM ) equipped with a monochromator (Polychrome VTM ), an Imaging System Controller and a cooled charged coupled device camera (TILL Imago VGATM ) controlled by TILL Vision software version 4.0. The microscope was operated in the split view mode using a dual excitation filter, a multichroic mirror and a dual emission filter. CFP was excited at 436 nm, YFP excited and bleached at 515 nm. Images were adjusted by pixel-to-pixel alignment and background-corrected by subtraction of the mean grey value (MGV) measured in a cell-free area in the proximity of the analyzed cells. The background was then clamped to zero by multiplying the background-corrected image by a binary image in which all pixels within the cell were set to a value of 1 and all the pixels outside the cell were set to a value of zero [30]. Two-by-two pixel binning was used to enhance the sensitivity and to minimize potential artifacts due to eventual deviations of cell position. FRET was assessed from the increase of CFP fluorescence (integrated grey value of the entire cell area) after 2 min of acceptor photobleaching and is denoted as the "CFP-gain" given in percent. Images were exported in 16-bit greyscale TIF format and further processed using the ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). 2.11. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of HaCaT cells Total RNA from HaCaT cells was isolated in duplicates with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and quantified by photometric analysis. After a 20 min digest with DNase I at RT, 1 g pure RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA utilising an

Fig. 1. Y2H interaction between TCTP and VDR. (A) Whereas SD-trp-leu only selects for individual plasmid uptake, positive Y2H interactions were evaluated by observing cell growth on 1 mM 3-AT supplemented medium additionally lacking adenine as well as histidine. Full-length VDR interacts with full-length human TCTP, but not with its S. cerevisiae homologue (MMI1), while neither VDR nor TCTP cause any yeast growth when co-transformed together with the distinct empty vector controls. The results are representative of 3 separate experiments. The already published interactions between human TCTP and eEF1 , VDR and RXR as well as murine p53 and SV40 served as internal controls.

iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The resultant cDNA was used as template for real-time PCR using a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and an iCycler apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). All PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 l and were performed in triplicates for each cDNA sample. The primers for VDR, TCTP and osteocalcin were designed using the online available primer 3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgibin/primer3/primer3 www.cgi.). Data were normalized against the unregulated tubulin transcript. Reactions were analyzed with the iCycler iQTM optical system software 3.1 by comparing the distinct cycle threshold values (ct ) that are depicted as relative normalized fold change within the particular graphs. No amplification was observed in the RNA control reactions up to a maximum of 40 cycles. Melting curve examinations and agarose gel electrophoresis determined that the amplified products were specific.

mixed in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT and 5% glycerol in the presence or absence of 500 nM calcitriol for 2 h at RT. Next, 50 l of the human TCTP promotor fragment were added and incubated for further 90 min. The reaction products were visualized through ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis for 1 h at 120 V through 1% agarose gels run in 1× TAE buffer.

3. Results 3.1. TCTP interacts with VDR in a Y2H assay To complete the already available spectrum of human TCTP interactors and to gain further insights into its ­ despite its manifold documented actions ­ still incompletely recognized physiological properties and regulatory aspects in skin, a preliminary Y2H analysis using full-length TCTP as bait was undertaken. We were able to identify several already published TCTP interacting molecules among our numerous isolated clones. This aspect implies that the GAL4 BD has not changed the actual conformation or functionality of our bait and that TCTP was properly located to the yeast nucleus as a prerequisite for its interaction with a potential prey protein. One positive candidate clone could be identified as vitamin D3 receptor (VDR, NP 000367.1, 48.2 kDa). By switching in a first step the BD to an AD fusion protein and vice versa, we confirmed that this novel PPI was indeed specific and not due to altered activities or binding properties between bait and prey. As evident from Fig. 1A, TCTP (in pGADT7) and VDR in (pGBKT7) definitely interact with each other. The same matter of fact applies to the already published interactions between TCTP and eEF1 [6] or VDR and RXR [32] which we included as additional internal controls.

2.12. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay Genomic DNA was isolated from HaCaTs via the Gentra® PUREGENE® DNA purification kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and rehydrated overnight at RT. The human TCTP promoter fragment from position -782 to -1 relative to the ATG initiation codon was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA after computer-assisted analysis of this respective region using the MatInspector Software [31] that predicts possible transcription factor binding sites. C-myc tagged VDR or RXR, untagged VDR or RXR (directly produced from PCR products containing a T7 promotor sequence via the TnT® Quick coupled in vitro transcription/translation system) or a combination of both proteins as well as the corresponding controls were

Fig. 2. In vitro pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation studies support our novel PPI data. (A) Both HIS-TCTP and the mutant protein carrying the A121 -x-x-A124 -A125 AA exchange are able to specifically pulldown GST-VDR. The VDR-specific protein band detected with an anti-GST antibody is lacking in the negative control. Calcitriol evidently has a stabilizing effect on the interaction. (B) Model of human TCTP drawn via 3D-JIGSAW (http://bmm.cancerresearchuk.org/3djigsaw/). To investigate the influence of the putative LxxLL-like motif on the interaction with VDR, we exchanged Ile121 , Ile124 and Leu125 into 3 alanines as indicated. (C) GST-TCTP is able to pulldown HIS-VDR from an E. coli lysate, whereas no unspecific interaction was again monitored between the empty column material and HIS-VDR. 4 l of the HIS-VDR E. coli lysate served as a Western Blot positive control. (D) Co-immunoprecipitation between c-myc tagged VDR immobilised to anti-c-myc antibody coupled beads and HIS-TCTP that was performed in the absence or presence of 1 M calcitriol. The latter stabilizes the binding between TCTP and VDR in vitro.

Although the whole TCTP family is evolutionarily highly conserved, displaying 42.1% identity and 64.3% similarity between the human and yeast protein sequence, we observed that VDR interacts with human, but not with S. cerevisiae TCTP (MMI1), pointing towards a contribution of different, probably unconserved AA residues. Secondly, the splitting of human TCTP into 3 parts (Figs. 1D and 2B), the separate subcloning of the 3 VDR domains as single fragments into pGBKT7 (Fig. 1E), and a consecutive screening procedure against each other, enabled us to elucidate the domains potentially involved in the TCTP­VDR interaction. The TCTP domains 1 (AA 1­70) and 3 (AA 133­172) did not interact with full-length VDR. Instead, the helical domain 2 (AA 71­132) which is also known to mediate the Ca2+ - and the (recently questioned) tubulin-binding properties as the only molecular functions that have been attributed to this area so far [1], was mapped as the VDR binding region (Fig. 1B and D). Next, our investigation of the relevant human TCTP domain 2 identified a putative NHR coregulatory LxxLL-like motif (Ile121 , Ile124 , Leu125 , Figs. 1D and 2B) in this region. Mutating the LxxLL-like motif into Ala121 -x-x-Ala124 -Ala125 could not abolish the interaction with VDR (data not shown), implying that additional binding regions within TCTP domain 2 are needed. It is, however, worth mentioning

that ­ in contrast to the respective full-length molecules where an equivalent observation could not be made ­ a combination of the putative TCTP LxxLL-like motif (I121 -x-x-I124 -L125 plus 24 nucleotides up- and 36 nucleotides downstream) together with full-length VDR resulted in enhanced yeast growth in the presence of 1 M calcitriol in comparison to untreated samples (Fig. 1C) as was monitored by spotting yeast suspensions with identical cell number. By co-transforming in a following approach the 3 separately subcloned VDR domains together with full-length TCTP, TCTP domain 2 or empty control vector pGADT7 into yeast strain AH109, we were able to reveal that VDR domain 3 which corresponds to the C-terminal LBD is responsible for the interaction with human TCTP and especially with TCTP domain 2 (Fig. 1B and E). 3.2. Human TCTP physically interacts in vitro with VDR We next carried out pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments to further confirm the specificity of our novel PPI. In the case of our in vitro HIS-pulldown assays, both full-length GST-tagged VDR (Fig. 2A) and VDR domain 3 (data not shown) were efficiently pulled down by HIS-TCTP bound to nickel beads.

A detailed testing of recombinant full-length HIS-TCTP where the LxxLL-like sequence was exchanged into A121 -x-x-A124 -A125 demonstrated, however, that this particular motif was not directly or exclusively responsible for the interaction since the mutant molecule was still found to be able to co-purify VDR in vitro. The addition of calcitriol to the pulldown reaction furthermore led to a stabilization of this PPI because the binding strength was a factor 1.38 more intensive in relation to untreated samples. Similarly, bacterially expressed HIS-VDR was also specifically pulled down by GST-TCTP bound to glutathione sepharose beads as illustrated in Fig. 2C. Comparably, TCTP could be successfully co-immunoprecipitated when c-myc tagged VDR was attached to anti-c-myc antibody coupled agarose (Fig. 2D). In agreement with the data presented above, exposure to calcitriol again enhanced the interaction potency nearly 2-fold. To investigate this PPI in a physiologically more relevant context, HaCaT cells transfected with TCTP-YFP or empty HaCaTs were lysed and the resultant cell extracts incubated with an immobilized polyclonal anti-TCTP antibody. The precipitated and co-purified proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western Blotting. Our data clearly reveal that endogenous VDR could be co-immunoprecipitated both from untransfected HaCaT lysates (Fig. 3A) and from TCTP-YFP overexpressing samples (Fig. 3B), confirming the direct and reciprocal binding between TCTP and VDR. 3.3. TCTP co-localizes with VDR upon induction of oxidative stress To examine the subcellular distribution of TCTP and VDR and to determine whether they actually reside in the same cellular compartment, mammalian expression constructs for YFPTCTP and tomato-VDR were transfected into HaCaT keratinocytes. Approaches with affinity-purified anti-TCTP and anti-VDR primary as well as fluorescent secondary antibodies revealed that the particular tag had no perturbing effect on the concrete protein localisation. VDR was found to be predominantly located in the nucleus and only slightly in the cytoplasm independent of calcitriol treatment (100­500 M). Consistent with previous publications and according to our parallel studies on HeLa cells (data not shown), TCTP was found throughout the cytoplasm, but could, after induction of mild oxidative stress (250 M-3 mM H2 O2 ), be observed to reversibly shuttle into the nucleus where it co-localized with its interaction target VDR (Fig. 4). Parenthetically, the addition of 1 M calcitriol alone had no effect on the localisation of TCTP. We could, however, notice that supplementing the medium with 1 M calcitriol during the recovery phase following a 60 min exposure to H2 O2 retained YFP-TCTP within the keratinocyte nuclei

(B) The same experiment as in (A), but using freshly prepared lysates from TCTP-YFP overexpressing cells. The respective input sample accordingly contains both endogenous (analogously to above) and the in comparison more abundant YFP-tagged TCTP (approximately 52 kDa). The observed signal is specific in both cases since VDR does not interact with the rabbit IgG-incubated protein A/G agarose beads.

which might play an important, but still elusive role for its interaction with VDR (data not shown). The translocation event was further confirmed by separating cells into the 4 subcellular fractions cytosol, nucleus, membrane as well as cytosekeleton and performing a Western Blot with an anti-TCTP antibody. As exemplified in Fig. 5, TCTP indeed appears to be significantly enriched in the nuclear fraction upon exposure to 3 mM H2 O2 . 3.4. Human TCTP interacts in vivo with VDR Lastly, we assessed the ability of TCTP and VDR to interact in living keratinocytes via FRET analysis and to this end fused YFP (acceptor fluorophore) to the N-terminus of TCTP and CFP (donor) to the C-terminus of VDR. As shown in Fig. 6, no CFP-gain was

evident in cells expressing CFP and YFP alone, thus excluding a random interaction of the fluorophores (CFP-gain = 0.05 ± 0.48%, n = 4). A significant CFP-gain of 2.02 ± 0.49% (n = 10) and of 3.79 ± 0.95% (n = 7) could be measured in non-stressed versus H2 O2 -treated cells co-transfected with CFP-VDR and YFP-TCTP, respectively, indicating once more that TCTP and VDR definitely interact with each other. 3.5. Ectopically expressed TCTP and VDR regulate each other The behaviour of TCTP and VDR towards each other under consideration of a selected calcitriol-regulated target gene as internal reference was subsequently evaluated by real-time PCR. As indicated in Fig. 7A, TCTP was upregulated in TCTP-overexpressing cells (ct 18.90 ± 0.15, internal standard) and even more upregulated (ct 18.01 ± 0.14) in VDR-overexpressing samples in comparison to empty pcDNA TM 6.2/N-EmGFP/YFP-DEST-transfected HaCaTs (ct 19.76 ± 0.15). VDR on the other hand was upregulated in VDR-overexpressing cells (ct 25.32 ± 0.38), but markedly downregulated upon TCTP overexpression (ct 32.42 ± 0.39) in relation to the empty vector control (ct 29.93 ± 0.87). Any consequence of treating HaCaTs with 100 nM calcitriol on TCTP mRNA level or of TCTP overexpression on osteocalcin mRNA level could not be demonstrated in our studies. Next, the protein levels of TCTP and VDR in untransfected HaCaT lysates as well as in TCTP- or VDRoverexpressing samples were monitored. Whereas in the empty HaCaT lysates (Fig. 7B), a TCTP protein band of approximately 25 kDa was detected, the staining signal of the corresponding molecule was 1.25-fold more intensive in VDR-overexpressing cells. An opposite result was obtained when we carried out Western Blots with anti-VDR antibodies because in the case of YFP-TCTP overexpression, VDR was significantly downregulated (factor 1.39) in comparison to untransfected HaCaT lysates. These data suggest a kind of homeostatic feedback mechanism between TCTP and VDR. Secondly, a computer-based search for binding sites of transcription factors in the 1.8 kb of the 5 human TCTP promotor region using the MatInspector software calculated several theoretical binding regions in both orientations for VDR-RXR and PPARG-RXR heterodimers between position -781 and -326. To confirm the predicted VDR binding site, we prepared a DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides -782 to -1 from genomic HaCaT DNA and tested its ability to bind nuclear proteins in an agarose electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As evident from Fig. 7C, in contrast to TCTP which does not have the capability to trigger any shift, VDR truly binds to the human TCTP promotor in vitro. Neither the treatment with 500 nM calcitriol, an addition of 10 g recombinant TCTP nor a combination of both approaches modified the observed pattern. A serial testing of VDR plus RXR (that does not

Fig. 7. Real-time PCR and gelshift analyses demonstrate that human TCTP represents a previously unknown VDR response gene whose protein product upon overexpression downregulates the amount of VDR on mRNA as well as protein level. (A) Real-time PCR study of TCTP and VDR in untransfected HaCaTs in comparison to TCTP- or VDRoverexpressing samples. The fusion tag has no perturbing effects on these experiments because the upregulation of the osteocalcin gene upon VDR overexpression on the one hand and the increase in VDR mRNA level following the addition of 100 nM calcitriol (data not shown) on the other is in accordance to current literature. Results are expressed as fold change. The unregulated tubulin transcript was used for normalization. (B) The Western Blot of the corresponding cell lysates shows a higher expression level of TCTP in VDR-overexpressing cells in relation to untransfected HaCaTs but reduced VDR protein levels in the case of TCTP-transfected samples. The loading of equal protein amounts was verified by staining the blots with an anti-annexin control antibody. (C) VDR causes a gel-shift when incubated together with the human TCTP promotor (P, white arrows), whereas neither TCTP alone nor the control reactions (in vitro transcribed and translated empty pGBKT7 incubated with the TCTP promotor or in vitro produced VDR without the addition of DNA) show a similar banding pattern in this molecular weight range. The observed shift is not influenced by the presence of TCTP, RXR or calcitriol.

attach to the TCTP promotor when examined individually) or of VDR, RXR plus TCTP in the presence or absence of calcitriol gave the same picture monitored with VDR alone, indicating that VDR most probably binds to the human TCTP promotor as a monomer or a homodimer. Approaches with the empty in vitro transcribed and translated pGBKT7 vector, with rabbit reticulocytes expressing VDR and RXR without the addition of promotor and the usage of untagged VDR and RXR proteins proved that the observed shift was indeed specific. 4. Discussion The main contribution of the present study is the description of an up to now unpublished PPI between human TCTP and VDR which we analyzed in vitro and in vivo. TCTP is a multifaceted housekeeping protein that consists, as depicted in Fig. 2B, of an -helical region, a -stranded core (where the majority of invariant residues are clustered) as well as a flexible loop [1,33]. The recent determination of the solution structure of its fission yeast

orthologue by NMR spectroscopy unexpectedly placed it close to a family of small chaperones [34]. Its definite mRNA and protein levels vary widely depending on the respective cell or tissue type (with the lowest degree of expression in brain and the highest one in mitotically active tissues or in human tumour biopsy specimens derived from laryngeal, skin, liver, thyroid, uterine, breast, prostate as well as rectal cancers) [1,35,36]. It is certainly worth mentioning that by subtractive hybridization and differential screening procedures, TCTP has already in 1998 been reported as a molecule which is upregulated in malignant rat glioma cells undergoing a cell death program when exposed to calcitriol [37]. VDR, on the other hand, displays a modular organisation characteristic for the NHR superfamily (Fig. 1E). It consists of a DNA binding section that comprises two cysteine-rich zinc-fingers, a weakly conserved hinge region considered to enable a sterically unrestricted rotation of the main domains relative to each other, and a globular C-terminal LBD which contributes to calcitriol binding, homo/heterodimerization, communication to transcription factors and interactions with numerous coregulatory molecules as well as

adapter proteins which are altogether crucial for regulating transcriptional activity [23,38,39]. Besides being found in malignant specimens such as carcinomas and melanomas, a lot of mammalian tissues including bone, intestine, brain, heart, stomach, pancreas, gonads and, most crucially for our study, skin express VDR where it has been detected in cell types such as keratinocytes [40], fibroblasts [41], Langerhans cells [42], melanocytes [43] or endothelial cells [44]. Hence, there is an apparent overlap between TCTP and VDR in multiple calcitriol-responsive cell types and tissues what makes their interaction on physiological level plausible. Structural analysis shows that the C-terminus of the VDR LBD upon binding of an agonistic ligand undergoes a drastic repositioning in the course of which helix 12 closes the ligand-binding pocket via a mouse-trap like folding event to constitute part of a charge clamp (involving K246 present in helix 3 and E420 located in helix 12) that allows the docking and final accommodation of transcriptional coactivators by forming hydrogen bonds with their LxxLL -helical peptide backbone [45­47]. In this context, we have proven that the VDR LBD is definitely responsible for the interaction with human TCTP and especially with TCTP domain 2 that notably contains a putative coregulatory LxxLL-like (Ile121 -x-xIle124 -Leu125 ) binding motif identified through a close inspection of the helical regions of various TCTPs from known x-ray and/or NMR structures [14,34,47,48]. The general trend for LxxLL motifs (where L represents leucine and x is any AA) includes a hydrophobic AA positioned at -1 and -7, a proline at -2, an aromatic residue at -3 and glutamate at location -5, hence creating an L-x-E/H-x-H/FP-L/M/I-L-x-x-L-L pattern [49], whereas TCTP rather comprises an M-x-G-x-A-E-Q-I121 -x-x-I124 -L125 sequence in this place. Although the AA residues flanking the main core are known to be important for the recognition of selected classes of NHRs in general, their exact number and composition can vary considerably among different coactivators [47,48]. Nevertheless, this TCTP motif has been determined not to be the main anchor for the interaction with VDR by two different experimental strategies. Furthermore, the LBDs of the NHR superfamily are only moderately conserved among each other, explaining why TCTP interacts with VDR, but not with its heterodimeric binding partner RXR as was analyzed in a further Y2H testing (data not shown). Moreover, calcitriol carries out its biological functions in vertebrates only, thus accounting for why no NHR exists in yeast and why human VDR does not interact with S. cerevisiae TCTP which only exhibits a minor degree of identity with its human counterpart in domain 2. Since neither Y2H experiments nor in vitro studies allow any conclusion on the TCTP-VDR interaction in its native environment, we performed co-localisation studies and achieved FRET measurements. The spontaneously immortalized human HaCaT cell line employed for these purposes is known to behave phenotypically like normal basal epidermal keratinocytes in terms of differentiation as well as growth and to develop in the absence of serum or other exogenous growth factors ­ features which make it a widely used cell culture system and a crucial model

for the highly proliferative epidermis [27­29]. Consistent with our (immuno-)fluorescence studies that were performed to investigate the endogenous association between TCTP and VDR in vivo, the majority of publications describe TCTP as a cytoplasmic protein, whereas a nuclear localisation has in fission yeast been found to be associated with cell stress [1]. Its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is moreover in remarkable analogy to the results recently obtained for its S. cerevisiae homologue which, upon induction of apoptosis by exposure to non-lethal 3 mM H2 O2 , 30 mM acetic acid or heat shock, shuttles from its normal cytoplasmic localisation to the mitochondria ­ symbolizing perhaps the cell's attempts to respond to harmful impulses created by internal or external stimuli ­ where it stably, but reversibly, attaches to their outer surface [50]. VDR was predominantly located in the nuclei of HaCaT keratinocytes albeit current knowledge implies that the unliganded receptor partitions consistently between cytoplasm and nucleus and undergoes a substantial nuclear translocation upon calcitriol treatment [51,52]. We could, to conclude, observe a significant co-localisation of human TCTP and VDR in the nuclei of HaCaT keratinocytes where transcription takes place and detect significant FRET signals both in unstressed and in H2 O2 -exposed cells, implying that the two proteins certainly have the ability to interact with each other within the living cell. It will, nevertheless, in future approaches be indispensable to investigate whether the observed H2 O2 -dependent translocation event of TCTP and its concomitant binding to VDR represents just a general oxidative stress reaction or for instance also occurs under Ca2+ stress, respectively. As a first possible hint on the question what the biological consequence of the interaction between TCTP and VDR in vivo could now be, we have compared the molecular and biological characteristics between TCTP and calcitriol, the ligand of VDR (see Table 2). Notably, both molecules display (at least to a large extent) completely opposite functions in the context of proliferation, apoptosis, second messenger control and tumour development [1,4,11,20,53­57]. TCTP is for example markedly overexpressed in tumour biopsy preparations where its presence has been shown to protect cells against apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide or 5 -fluorouracil in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas conversely, it is among the 263 genes that are significantly downregulated in the course of tumour reversion [58,59]. The experimental transfection of antisense TCTP constructs into the breast cancer cell line MCF7 is associated with massive, spontaneous dying of cells [60], emphasizing once more the importance of the (Ca2+ binding) protein TCTP for regulating cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, calcitriol signalling with its well-known antiproliferative, pro-differentiating effects on keratinocytes as well as other cell types [54,61] has the potential to arrest cell cycle progression at the G0 /G1 transition through targeting the transcription of a number of regulatory proteins including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 [62] and has in particular been described as a tumour growth inhibiting compound [55,63,64]. It moreover induces apoptosis through modulating the

reciprocal Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL versus Bax, Bak or Bad contents and through increasing intracellular Ca2+ which again activates Ca2+ proteases such as e.g. microcalpain or caspase 12 [65,66], but also protects, as has only recently emerged, human skin cells against environmental hazards including ionizing or UV radiation, microbial infections as well as oxidative stress [67,68]. Finally, we were able to identify a direct feedback mechanism between these two molecules: recombinant VDR has the ability to bind to the human TCTP promotor, indicating a regulatory site. Ectopically in HaCaTs expressed VDR enhances transcription and translation of the human TCTP gene, and TCTP subsequently downregulates the amount of VDR. The completely opposed properties of TCTP and calcitriol in the context of our observations lead to the notion that TCTP is a further member in calcitriol signalling possibly associated with tumour phenotype or development. Recapitulating current literature, one remarkable yet speculative connection that will be a matter of further considerations and subject of more detailed forthcoming experimental approaches could hence be that human TCTP and VDR engage in mutually guiding proliferation and especially survival of keratinocytes.
