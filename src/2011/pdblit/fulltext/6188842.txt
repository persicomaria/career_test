structure of the proteic complex formed by bovine The three-dimensional trypsinogen and the porcine pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (Kazal type) has been solved by means of Patterson search techniques, using a predicted model of the trypsin-ovomucoid complex (Papamokos et al., 1982). The structure of the complex, including 162 solvent molecules, has been refined at l%A resolution (26,341 unique reflections) to a conventional crystallographic R factor of 0195. The inhibitor molecule binds to trypsinogen via hydrogen bonds and/or apolar interactions at sites P9, P7, P6, P5, P3, PI, Pl', P2' and P3' of the contact area. The structure of the inhibitor itself resembles closely that of the third domain of Japanese quail ovomucoid inhibitor, recently reported by Weber et al. (1981). The trypsinogen part of the complex resembles trypsin, as is the case in the trypsinogen-basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex, but two segments of the activation domain adopt a different conformation. Most notably in the N-terminal region the Ile16-Gly19 loop, which is disordered in free trypsinogen and in the trypsinogen-basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex (Huber & Bode, 1978), assumes a regular structure and the polypeptide chain can be traced as far as residue Asp14. This new and fixed structure allows the formation of a buried salt link between the side-chains of Lys156 and Asp194. Conformations differing from those of trypsin are also found for residues 20 to 28 and residues 141 to 155. Some structural perturbation is observed in other parts of the molecule, including the calcium loop.

1. Introduction
The serine proteinase family is one of the most thoroughly studied classes of enzymes: biochemical. kinet.ical and structural investigations have produced a considerable amount of 1iterat)ure on the subject. and have led to consist,ent hypotheses on their mechanism of action. In this framework the interact,ion of pancreatic trypsin, and of it's precursor trypsinogen. wit)h the prot,ein proteinase inhibitor BPTI (basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Kunitz type). is a very wellknown example of a protein complex whose overall physico-chemical properties ha,ve been integrated by atomic description of the three-dimensional st.ruetures (Huber et aE.. 1975: Huber & Bode. 1978; Bode et al., 1978). Serine proteinaseeprotein inhibitor complexes have also been crystallized and studied from sources other than the mammalian pancreas: the st'ructures of the soybean trypsin inhibitor-trypsin complex (Sweet et ~1.. 1974) a,nd of the Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor with subtilisin BPN' (Mitsui et aE., 1979) has been reported to nearly atomic resolution. Notwithst,anding the fact. that, several classes of serine proteinase protein inhibitors seem to share a common mechanism of action (Laskowski 8 Kato, 1980), a detailed understanding of the physiological function of t,he inhibitors is somewhat, lacking. In general it can be stated that serine proteinase inhibitors in viva prevent unwanted proteolgsis. but t'his molecular action may result in quit,e different physiological events according to the organ or tissue in which it t'akes place. Serine proteinase protein inhibitors fall into endowed approximately nine homologous families. which account for inhibitors with quite different structures and specificities. Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, together with dog submandibular, acrosine, and avian ovomucoid inhibitors. belong to the Kazal-type family, a t,hat ma.y show mult,idotnain structures (Laskowski Pr Kato. group of inhibitors 1980). PSTIt was first isolated from bovine pancreas by Kazal et al. (1948), who distinguished it from the BPTI inhibitor on the basis of its temporary inhibitory action in the presence of excess trypsin. It is believed that the presence of PST1 in the pancreatic juice prevents the premature trypsin-catalysed activation of trypsinogen. and therefore of other proenzymes. within the organ. The PST1 molecule is composed of 56 amino acid residues containing three disulphide bridges: human, porcine, ovine and bovine inhibitors show strong sequence homology (Greene ef al.. 1976). PST1 and ovomucoids are homologous proteins, but there are subst,antial differences: there is a deletion in the segment between the first and second-half cyst,ine, and extensive amino acid exchanges occur in the regions 1 to 16 and 40 to 49. Recent purification and nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown that PST1 is present in three molecular forms (forms I, 11 and III) which differ. respecbively, in t,he N-terminal region by four and eight residues (DeMarco rt al., 1979,1982). Previous crystallographic work both on the structure of trypsin and trypsinogen the details of the as well as on their complexes with BPTI h as elucidated mechanism of trypsin activation (for a review. see Huber & Bode, 1978). It has been shown that even in the absence of specific proteolpsis. the activation domain of

trypsinogen (4 polypeptide loops disordered or unusually flexible in the zyniogen) can be brought to an ordered structure, very similar to that of trypsin, by the hinding of the BPTI inhibitor. The study of the three-dimensional structure of the trgpsinogen-PST1 complex thus not only brings additional information on the molecular structure of the Kazal-type inhibitors, but also sheds light on the details of new protein-protein interactions at the reactive site and in the activation domain of a naturally occurring, functional enzyme-inhibitor complex. In t'his paper we report on the crystallographic analysis of the trppsinogen-PST1 three-dimensional structure, and discuss its details in comparison wit,h the structure of trypsinand trypsinogen-BPTI complexes. The st,ructural analysis of the complex was pursued by means of Patterson search techniques (for a review, see Rossmann, 1973); the choice of this particular method of investigation stems from the following considerations : (1) the structures of the trypsinogen-BPTI complex and of the third domain of the Japanese quail ovomucoid inhibitor are known and refined at atomic resolution (Bode et al.. 1978; Papamokos rt al.. 1982); (2) analysis of the main-chain conformation in a number of inhibitors. and in particular in the ovomucoid inhibitor. shows a good conservation of the reactive site geometry, allowing one to predict the overall orientation of the whole inhibitor molecule bound to tjhe cognate enzyme active site. On this basis a hypot'hetical model for the complex using the refined structures of trypsin (Huber et ~1.. 1974) and of the quail ovomucoid inhibitor was built (Papamokos et 02.) 1982). This was the starting molecular model employed in the Patterson search described t)Plow.

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Crystallization and data collection Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (form I) was purified from porcine pancreatic extracts as described by Burck (1970) with some minor modifications (Menegatti et al., 1981). Bovine trypsinogen was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt) and used without, further purification. The crystals of the complex were grown in microdialysis buttons from solutions containing trypsinogen and PST1 in a molar ratio of 1 : 2, as reported (Bolognesi et a/.. 1981). The complex crystallizes in space group P2,2,2, with cell dimensions a = 67.1 A, b = 75.58. c = 66.9 A. one molecule/asvmmetric unit. In order to apply Patterson search techniques a first medium resolution `data set was &lected using a Philips PWllOO 4-circle diffractometer, equipped with an extension arm and helium-filled tube. A total of 7300 reflect,ions to 3.0 a resolution were collected employing 3 crystals with the omega scan IntegraGon range was between 04" and 0.8" and the scan speed varied between terhnique. 001 and (bO3"/s, according to the particular crystal: background radiation was measured for 2 or 4 s on each side of the reflectioli. Radiation damage was monit,ored on 3 reference reflections every 3 h. and the crystals were discarded whenever one of the 3 intensities had varied by more than loo/,. For every crystal 2 ecluivalent reflections, hkl and lilc[ were measured and the diffraction data were collected starting from high resolution and moving towards toner resolutions. Considerable overlap between data sets of different crystals was allo\vrd and a common tow resolution shell of reflections (@034 < sint!?/X < 0056) was vollectrd for each specimen for scaling. Lorentz polarization as well as empirical absorption corrections (Korth et al., 1967) were applied to t,he raw intensities of the 3 vystals and quivalent reflections were then averaged. These data sets were subseyuenttp brought, to a common scale and merged. High resolution photographir data were csollected at a second stage using a rotation (`amera (Hubrr,. Rimsting.

significantly the mean life of the specimens in the X-ray beam. Four crystals were employed t,o collect the full data set to 1% A resolution. The crystals were rotated around the UC diagonal, with rotational angles of 2.0" per exposure. The focus-to-crystal distance was 350 mm and the 3-films pack was positioned at 45 mm from the crystal. In all, 69,422 reflections were collected, measured on an Optronics PlOOO microdensitometer. and processed according to Schwager et al. (197.5). The programs were modified by W. S Bennett. The whole data set was reduced to 26,341 unique reflections, which represent 84% of the at 1% A resolution. The merging factor (Rmerge possible measurable reflections = El](j) - (Z)l/,U(j), where (I) is the average intensity for reflection h, Z(j) is the intensity value in the jth measurement of the same reflection, and the sum is extended to all the reflections) was 0.084; this value did not show significant improvement when the analytical absorption correction procedure of Schwager et al. (1973) was applied. (b)

As mentioned above the starting molecular model of the complex was built on an interactive computer graphics system (Jones, 1978) from trypsin and OMJPQ3 refined coordinates, imposing to the inhibitor an orientation that allowed complementary fitting in the active site region on the basis of the trypsin-BPTI complex (Papamokos et al., 1982). The side-chains of the ovomucoid inhibitor, which were not in common with PSTI, were truncated to Ala or Gly wherever proper. The rotational Patterson search was conducted using the method and programs described elsewhere (Huber, 1965; Fehlhammer & Bode, 1975). The trypsinogen-PST1 Patterson function was first explored on a coarse angular grid (5" increments on each of the 3 polar and X) using as a model vector set the hypothetical complex mentioned above as angles 6, (CI

well as the refined model of trypsin itself in 2 independent runs. The 3.0 A diffractometer data set was used throughout: only the 2000 highest peaks were considered in the evaluation of the agreement between the 2 functions, while the region of space explored had radial limits of 5 and 20 B. The 2 parallel searches produced similar results. For the hypothetical complex the highest correlation peak was 4.8 standard deviations above the mean correlation at, angular positions 4 = 65". * = 115' and K = 105' (polar angles) ; the second highest, peak was approx. 1 standard deviation lower. (Polar angle definition : C$and I,!Idefine the direction of the rotation axis, 4 being the, inclination to the y-axis and 4 being thr azimuthal angle be&Teen the x-axis and the projection of the rotat,ion axis onto the x 2 plane. K is the rotation angle.) to a-hat one could have expected. the peak to background ratio was more Contrary favourable when the rotational search was conduct,ed with trypsin alone. In that case thr highest correlation peak was 6 standard deviations above the mean correlation at + = 65'. + = 120" and K = 105". the second highest peak being approx. 2 standard deviations loner than the first. The searches were subsequently run on a finer angular grid giving the final solutions + = 66". (CI= 118" and K = 108" (peak height : 3.4 standard deviations above mean value) fol the trypsin-OMJPQS complex, and 4 = 66'. 4 = 117" and K = 104" (peak height 6.8 st,andard deviations above mean value) for t)rypsin alone. The positioning of the correctly oriented complex molecule was then achieved in reciprocal space using a translation function program written by E. Lattman and based on the algorithm of (:rowther 6 Blow- (1967). Three Ha,rker sections were calculated ; as can be seen from Fig. 1 outstanding peaks (12 standard deviations) were found when the oriented trgpsin model was u.sed for the translational search The corresponding t'ranslation vector was t = (23.26, 10.16. 1.67) A. Again the samt' solution could be obtained starting from the trypsin OXJPQ3 complex. but,, as for the rotational part. the peak t,o background ratio was deviations). lower (9 standard Structurcx fa,ctors lvere calculated for the appropriately rotated and translated coordinates of the hypot,hrtical trypsin-OXJPQS complex. Thr initial crystallographic K valur in the resolution range 7.0 to 3.0 a was 0485. Most of the above-mentioned calculations were performrd with Strigrmann's (1974) PROTEIN program system.

In order t,o define the alcove-dt~termined orirnt,ation more accurately, refinement started as a rigid body refinement of the hypothetical complex. By means of the program WRELS (Sussmann it nl., 1977) 3 positional and 3 rotational parameters were allowed to vary independently for thrx trypsinogen and for the inhibitor parts of the complex. The refinement was conducted using a partial data set. 1870 reflections between 5.5 and 4.0 A resolution. C'onvergencc. as judged from evaluation of t,he conventional crystallographic tl factor, was reached after 4 cycles: the changes of the positional parameters of the centre of mass of trypsin \vere negligible. thosr of OMJPQ3 were found to be contained within a fellunit. Borne rt~lative reorientation of trypsinogen and inhibitor had tenths of an gngstriim occurred (Table I ). These findings explain, at least part,ially, why the trypsinogrn-OMJPQS solutions in the Patterson search compared to the complex model yielded less significant described trypain model. The structural differences brt\veen OMJPQ3 and Kazal inhibitor model and experimental Patterson bclo\v also decrease the corrrspondence between functions. WRELS reduced the R value to 0,392 in thr resolution range 7.0 to 3.0 a. The resulting atomic model was subjected to 7 cycles of EREF (Jack & Levitt, 1978: Levitt, 1974) without visual inspection and/or any other manual change except setting "dummy" (dummy atoms do not contribut,e to calculated residues 308 to 314 of the inhibitor structure factors). In order to distinguish the inhibit,or from trypsinogen. inhibitor residues havr 300 added to their residue number: also for ease of comparison with OMJPQ3 some has been imposed on the first 10 residues of PSTI. The N-terminal sequence used renumbering

Table 2 gives a summary of the crystallographic refinement. It describes in terms of R value and energies the state of refinement, whenever manual intervention was considered necessary. On the average 7 cycles of EREF were calculated between the different stages. Manual corrections of the model were performed on a Vector General 3400-PDP 11/40 interactive display system, using the program FRODO (Jones, 1978). Electron density maps for visual inspections of the models were oftype 2F,,- Yc throughout ; the use of Sim-weighted phases (Sim, 1959; Hendrickson & Lattman, 1970) was found to improve the interpretability of the maps, especially in regions where in previous stages part of the polypeptide chain had been omitted from the calculation. At stages 6 and 7 conventional difference density maps were also calculated and plotted, which proved to be useful for locating solvent molecules. To speed up convergence of the refinement a fractional shift factor had to be determined. whicbh. when applied to the shifts calculated from the X-ray contribution to EREF alone, brings the R value to a true minimum. This scale factor was found to be 0.3, irrespective of the resolution limit,s used. After each manual correction one cycle of EREF followed where only the energy term was minimized, thus creating a model with essentially perfect stereochemistry. In subsequent EREF cycles the scale factor that converts the X-ray contribution into a pseudo-energy and thus determines the relative weight of energy term and X-ray term was carefully chosen so that, despite a reasonable decrease in crystallographic residual, the energy stayed close to the initial value. Manual corrections at stages 1 and 2 mainly dealt with the inhibitor: the correct amino acid sequence for PST1 was introduced; residues for which the electron density indicated large differences between OMJPQ3 and PST1 (301 to 305,308 to 314 and 339 to 348) were set "dummy" or partly rebuilt (Fig. 2). The N terminus of trypsinogen (17 to 18) and residues 143 to 15-t were noticed to have a different conformation from trypsin and were set "dummy" as well. At stage 3 residues 143 to 154 were rebuilt and the N-terminal residues 14 to 16 inserted. Another change in trypsinogen structure was noticed at stage 4. Residues 23 to 26 take part in cvstal contact in the PSTI-trypsinogen complex and adopt a conformation different from that of free trypsinogen or of the trypsinogen-BPTI complex. At stage 5 an attempt was made to locate the internal water molecules found in the trypsin-BPTI complex (Huber et aZ., 1974) in the trypsinogen-PST1 complex. Eighteen out of 28 solvent molecules could be found even at 3.0 A resolution. After stage 5 high resolution data to 1.8 A became available. As the radius of convergence in refinement is related to the resolution, extension of resolution to 1.8 11 involved 3 cycles of EREF at) an intermediate resolution of 2.4 A followed by 3 cycles at maximum resolution. Manual corrections at stages 6 and 7 included the localization of 144 additional solvent molecules. one sulphate ion and a calcium ion of half occupancy. It was also possible to trace

Refinement between stage 5 and the end also included a total of 8 cycles of temperature factor refinement. As the maximal resolution of 1.8 A does not allow individual atomic temperature factors, mean values were calculated for main-chain atoms (including CB) and side-chain atoms, separately.

When the high resolution data became available, it was clear from the electron densit,y map that the peptide of Lys318 showed some degree of pyramidalization, as could be expected from the crystal structures of trypsin-BPTI or tiypsinogenBPT1 complexes (for a review, see Huber & Bode, 1978). As standard values and force constants for bond angles and bond lengths in EREF are tailored to keep the peptide units planar, these restraints were modified and weakened in test calculations. These calculations demonstrated the influence of the restraints on the peptide geometry observed, but indicated also that useful qualitative information about peptide distortion can be obtained. In order to simplify comparisons, the standard restraints were used further on. In addition the carbonyl carbon of Lys318 was given no non-bonded interaction potential, thus allowing the OC of Serl95 to approach beyond normal van der Waals' contact distance. The final refined co-ordinates of the trypsinogen-PSTI complex have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein rt nl., 1977). (d) Structural cornprisons The refined structure of the trypsinogenPST1 complex was compared both with the structure of trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975) and with the refined structure of OMJPQ3 (Papamokos et al., 1982), using an atom displacements minimization procedure. In the comparison with trypsin an initial run, which included all backbone atoms and CB atoms with the exception of residues 14 to 17, 22 to 26 and 142 to 155. showed that 2 additional segments had conformations that were to be considered as significantly different from those of trypsin. In a subsequent run residues 77 to 79 and 115 to 117 were excluded also from the calculation. For the 959 atoms of the trypsinogen part of the complex the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation is 0.37 A. Analogously for the 171 selected backbone atoms of PST1 the r.m.s. distance from those of OMJPQ3 is 0.85 A. In this case the comparison was conducted with the exclusion of residues 301 to 313 and 340 to 347.

3. Results
(a) The structure of the inhibitor The overall three-dimensional structure of t,he PST1 inhibitor is homologous with that of the third domain of the <Japanese quail ovomucoid inhibitor, notwithstanding their relative distance in the evolutionary tree of Kazal-type proteinase inhibitors (Dayhoff, 1978). Strict coincidence of polypeptide chains, however, does not occur throughout the two molecules (Fig. 2) ; as will be discussed below, crystal packing and/or substantial differences in the primary structures may account for the observed CA displacements. The secondary structure of PST1 consists of an a-helix and a small antiparallel /3sheet, which together account for 410/b of the residues. The n-helix stretches from Glu334 to Lys342 and is approximately positioned along the longest axis of the molecule. Most of its apolar side-chains act as spacers between the helix itself and the p-sheet, on one side, and the 309-316 loop, on the other. The N terminus of the helix supports a short stretch of extended structure around Asn333, which runs antiparallel and close to the reactive site loop. All the /3 structure of the molecule is contained in the mentioned antiparallel p-sheet, which is twisted, and comprises in its three strands residues Va1323 to Thr326. Asp327 to Tyr331 and Leu349 to Ser353. As can be seen from Figure 2 the first two strands enclose a reverse turn centred on residues 326 and 327, which according to the classification of Crawford et aZ.(1973)canbedefinedasatypeIreverseturn(-63", -15"; -77", -14"for$l,$l; $2, 42). Another reverse turn is observed at the C terminus of the n-helix, where

residues 341 to 344 allow a sharp inversion of the chain path. The turn is not regular, and its conformational parameters are those of a distorted type III turn - 13". - 102", 30"); nevertheless a strong hydrogen bond (2.84 8) is (-68". observed between 341 0 and 344 N. The remainder of the molecule does not show defined secondary structure. In particular residues 301 to 322,39% of the structure

enclosing the reactive site loop and two disulphide bridges, adopt an extended conformation: which stretches across the whole molecule and protrudes Lys318 to the solvent and eventually towards the trypsin(ogen) active site. The main-chain hydrogen-bonding pattern (Table 4A) strictly resembles that found for OMJPQ3 (Papamokos et al., 1982) : the only notable differences are in the N-terminal region of the molecule (hydrogen bonds 304-350 and 313-315) and at residue 347, which is Pro in PSTI. The differences found in the N-terminal region reflect, as discussed below, the different conformation of the two inhibitors in this zone. Consideration of side-chain hydrogen bond formers does not alter considerably the pattern observed in OMJPQ3 (Table 4B). Where side-chains are conserved, hydrogen bonds of comparable strength are formed. Notably in the case of the hydrogen bond between the side-chain of residue Glu334 and the backbone nitrogen of Thr307 in PSTI, the hydrogen bond polarity is reversed in OMJPQS. where the side-chain NZ of Lys334 hydrogen bonds to the backbone oxygen of Asp307. Owing to the substitution Arg344 --t Ser344, the two hydrogen bonds of the Arg344 guanidino group to Tyr331 OEH do not find a counterpart in the ovomucoid inhibitor. Moreover, in PST1 the side-chain of residue Ser339 finds hydrogen bond acceptors in the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Cys335 and Va1336, while in OMJPQ3

This situation not only reflects differences in the nature of the respective residues in the two inhibitors, but also is a probe of the different structures of the two polypeptide chains in this region. Although the reactive site loop is in a rather extended conformation, its tertiary structure seems rather well-architected in order to keep it protruding from the surface of the molecule, and with main-chain torsional angles fulfilling the requirements of stereochemically complementary recognition between enzyme and

inhibitor (Figs 3, 4 and 5). On the C-terminal side of the Lys318-Leu319 bond the network of hydrogen bonds building up the p-sheet, together with the 324-356 disulphide bridge, gives structural stability and secures the end of the reactive site loop to the core of the molecule. On the shorter amino-terminal side the hydrogenbonding capability is impaired by the presence of Pro317; the only t,wo intramolecular interactions are the disulphide 316-335 and a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Pro317 and Asn333 ND2. This latter residue is strongly conserved in the Kazal inhibitor family ; its side-chain makes two hydrogen bonds to the nearest residues neighbouring the reactive site bond. It has been proposed that Asn333 acts as a fixed spacer that sets the distance between the so-called primary and secondary contact loops in the functional complex (Papamokos et al., 1982). As mentioned above the three-dimensional structures of PST1 and OMJPQS differ substantially in their E-terminal regions. Figure 2 shows the two structures and Methods: it can be easily appreciated that overlaid as described in Materials the extended backbones follow different paths. crossing each other at Va1307, and subsequently diverging again. In the case of PSTI, whose primary structure is known to differ from the OMJPQ3 sequence by a deletion after the first cysteine, the polypeptide chain is kept close to the core of the molecule by the strong hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Arg304 and the amido nitrogen of Ile350. It thus shields from solvent the apolar side-chain of this latter residue (Ile350) together with Leu349 and Va1348. OMJPQS is known to crystallize in space group P42,2, with four molecules per asymmetric unit; two interacting tetramers give rise to a novel secondary structure element, which has been described as a /!channel (Weber et al., 1981). Residues 1 to 6 participate in t,he contacts and hydrogen bonds which build up the p-channel in the crystal. Since no tetrameric structure has been observed in ultracentrifuge studies, it is conceivable that the /cchannel is a crystal artifact, and that the conformation of the first six residues in

OMJPQ3 is not the one to be expected in the functional complex. The perturbation of the structure. however, stretches further on, as shown in Figure 2. Beyond Cys308 t,wo main reasons may account for the considerable CA distances. On one side, as already mentioned, this loop is one residue shorter in PSTI. on the other the OMJPQ3 structure contains a Pro residue (Pro312), which occurs in the cis caonfiguration and may impose some caonstraints on the neighbouring residues. In addition the structural perturbations induced by the P-channel in OMJPQ3 ma) influence the conformation of the residues following Cys308. From residue 336 on the two n-helices diverge and it is not, before Val348 that t,he t'wo chains come back into close approach. Inspection of t'he two structures, and of their torsional angles, shows that the different locations of the 308-338 disulphide bridges hare the effect of inducing a local perturbation of the helices. which then follow slightly different paths. It seems reasonable that this perturbation appears towards the (' terminus of the helix and not in the other direction. As has alread? been pointed out the secondary contact loop area is kept' in a rather fixed conformat,ion by a series of strong hydrogen bonds, while the 345 (glycosylation site in OKJPQ3) loop is exposed to the solvent and devoid of st,rong intramolecular interactions. Seven residues of the inhibitor share hydrogen bonds with residues of a syrnmet'ry-related trypsinogen molecule in the crystal lat,tice. They all are caontributed from the inhibitor p-sheet region and make contacts wit'h residues PO to 26 of trypsinogen. An additional interaction occurs at the PST1 C t,erminus. where the free carboxylate of Cys356 forms an intermolecular salt link to Lysl59 KZ : this latter side-chain participates, in turn. in an intramolecular hydrogen bond with TyrdO OEH.

(b) Trypsinogrn

structuw

The crystallographic studies of trgpsinogen and of its complex with bovine BPTT (Bode et al.. 1978) have shown that the free proenzyme structure resembles strictly that of trypsin. with the exception of four polypeptide loops that are not visible in the Fourier maps. Three of these segments build up the so-called activation domain (Huber Nt Bode. 1978). In the trypsinogen-BPTI complex the activation domain assumes a well-defined struct'ure, very similar to that of t'rypsin. The fourt'h segment. enclosing the N-terminal residue up to Gly19, is disordered in trypsinogen-BPTI and assumes an ordered three-dimensional structure only when t,r,vpsinogen is convert'ed into trypsin by specific cleavage of the N-terminal hexapept'ide (Bode & Bchwager. 1975). Under these conditions the positive charge of the trypsin Ile16 amino end finds suitable location and charge balance in a neighbouring binding pocket hosting Aspl94. In the trypsinogen-BPTI complex t,he =2sp194 binding pocket is empty. but binds exogenous Ile-\`a1 dipeptide with caonsiderable strength. This ternary coomplex most closely resembles t,rypsin-RPTI (Bode et al.. 1978). In the trypsinogen-PST1 complex only part of the structural event's cahararterizing t'rypsin activat'ion takes place in a strictly comparable manner. Two loops of the activation domain, Gl,v184A to Gly193 and (~1~216 t'o Asn223, show

reasons that will become clearer later the N terminus of trypsinogen does not find its way into the Ile16 binding pocket, as in the case of activated trypsin, Rather, from residue 14 onwards, the chain runs on the molecular surface of t,he protein for approximat,ely half of its diameter in a fairly extended conformation (Fig. 4). A network of hydrogen bonds to different, parts of the trypsinogen molecule (Table 5A) keeps the Asp14 to Thr26 polypeptide segment in close contact with the molecular surface, allowing efficient burial of hydrophobic residues. Figure 6bhows the conformation adopt*ed b; the six N-terminal residues that could be fitted t,o the electron density of trypsinogen in our complex. Part of residue 17 and residues 18 to 21 assume a trypsin-like conformation. Kossiakoff et al. (1977) report)ed that in their 1.9 d structure of trypsinogen the N-terminal electron density was interpretable up to residue \`allO. Since their data were not available t'o us, nor has this structure been fully refined. no comparison was possible between t'he two stjructures; in no other case have the first eight residues of trypsinogen been (Bode et ~1.. 1978). Walter et al. (1982) have recent]) observed at room temperature investigated the low temperature structure of free trypsinogen. In t)heir study they show that at 103 K the N-terminal segment of the proenzyme assumes a defined conformation from residue \Tal17 onwards. In trypsinogen-PST1 and in the low temperature structure Tall 7 and Gly18 assume entirely different conformations. the deviation between the two (`A atoms of Iesidue 17 being 10~~. The conformation at the peptide bond Lysl5-Ilel6 in trypsinogen-PSTI, which is cleaved during activation. is such that the polypeptide chain is kinked at this position (Fig. 6). &Qthough the 4 and 4 torsional angles of Lys15 are not far from rt nl.. 1982), the S-terminal those of a good trypsin substrat,e (Paparnokos polypeptide chain assumes a conformation that is probably bent too much for complementary binding to a trypsin-like active site. Resides. the carbonyl oxygen of t,he scissilr peptide (015) forms a strong hydrogen bond to X1-14 (2.78 a): the Lys.15Ilel6 peptide bond, in the conformation observed in trypsinogen-PST1 complex. t,hus seems scarcely accessible tjo the activating enzyme.

It should be noticed that residue 23 is a glycinr. a

residue frequently found in hinge or flexible regions. Considering that the 23-327 hydrogen bond occurs between main-chain atoms, we believe it to be the cause of the peptide unit flip-over observed at' residues 22 to 23 (Fig. 7). The flexibility of this short stretch of polypeptide chain is stressed if one compares it with the contacting zone of the symmetry-related inhibitor. Residues 326 and 327 make part of the p-turn in the three-stranded p-sheet; thus they belong to a rather rigid element of secondary structure unlikely to be deformed without alteration of the inhibitor structure itself. The 4, 4 torsional angles around these two residues are virtually identical with those found in the structure of OMJPQ3 (Fig. 2). The influence of the structure adopted by the 20-28 loop can be noticed also in another exposed segment of the polypeptide chain. At, residues 115 to 117 atom deviations greater than 1 A are found in the comparison with trypsin. In trypsinogen-PST1 these three residues adopt the conformation of a heavily distorted reverse turn, devoid of internal hydrogen bonding. Two residues most likely contribute to altering the strucbure of this region, which also in trypsin fails to adopt a regular conformation. The side-chain of Serll6 is capable of hydrogenhonding to t'he side-chain of Asn25. The hydrogen bond could be rather strong. since torsional angles allow a short contact distance between Serll6 OG and Asn25 ODl (2.8 A). Unfortunately Asn25 has its side-chain slightly disordered, and we have some uncertainty in the location of the 25 ODl and 25 ND2 atoms. The same holds for the side-chain of Argll7, which, as built, is 2.76 A away from Asp71 ODl ; the density of Argll7 stretches only just beyond CB. It is worth pointing out that hot,h residues Asn25 and Asp71 in trypsinogen-PST1 are considerably displaced from their positions in trypsin (252 and 456 A, respectively); Serl16 and Argl17 show accordingly the largest deviations in this area (8 CA 116 = 1.90 A; 6 CA 117 = 1.56 A). Between residues 142 and 155, the autolysis loop, we find additional significant differences between the structures of trypsinogenPSTI and trypsinBPTI (Fig. 8). Starting from residue 142, a glycine, the two polypeptide chains follow entirely different paths. Deviations as large as 5 A are found at residues 150 and 152: unfortunately, however, nothing can be said about residues 146 and 147. since the electron density abruptly ends after the carbonyl of Lys145. The whole loop appears as two twisted antiparallel strands connected by a distorted reverse turn : it is fully exposed to solvent from residues 146 to 149. Hydrogen bonds occur mainly within the loop itself (Table 5B); only two of them are involved in interactions with other parts of the molecule. Nl44-015 (2.78 A) and 0155-N22 (3.22 A) hydrogen bonds occur between main-chain atoms, and both are directed towards parts of the trypsinogen molecule, which in our case adopt' a novel conformation. It is thus not surprising to find a new structure even for the autolysis loop. As mentioned above, and is well-known from activation studies (Huber & Bode, 1978), the structural event that triggers the correct rigidification of the trypsin specificity pocket is a conformational change at residue AspI94, whose side-chain salt-links t'o the Ilel6 N terminus in the trypsin conformation. In free trypsinogen Asp194 is differently oriented and hydrogen-bonded to N of Trpl41, NE2 of His40 and to water molecule 701 (Fehlhammer et aE., 1977; Huber & Bode, 1978). In trypsinogen-BPTI the Asp194 conformation is as in trypsin (Bode et aE., 1%X%), although its charge is not balanced by a protein residue. Since the Ile16 pocket is 1::

empty a number of water molecules fill the cavity and reach Asp194. The Nterminal residues 10 to 17 remain exposed to the solvent and are disordered. In the case of trypsinogen-PST1 Asp194 is in the same conformation observed in trypsin and the trypsin-BPTI complex. However, the Ilel6 binding pocket is occupied by Lys156, which forms a salt link to the Asp194 carboxylate. The side-chain of Lys156 hydrogen bonds also to 0142 (3.07 8) and to 0140 (3.42 A) (Fig. 9). The comparison with trypsin indicates also that, all of the residues influencing the Asp194 orientation adopt very similar conformations in the trypsinogen-PST1 complex. The conformation adopted by Lys156 in trypsin or in the trypsin(ogen)BPTI complex would not be allowed in the trypsinogen-PST1 case. The structural differences we find in the K-terminal region are such that the side-chain of Ile16 is approximately 7 A away from the position it occupies in trgpsin-BPTI. In this new conformation the Ile16 side-chain is out of the pocket and points towards the of its side-chain 19-20 peptide bond, forcing residue Lys156 to alter the orientation mainly by means of a 180" rotation around the CA-CB bond. In trypsinogenPST1 the Lys156 side-chain intrudes into the Ile16 pocket, is thus fully buried, and its positive charge is balanced by a salt link to the Asp194 carboxylate. A comparable situation has been found in Streptomyces griseus serine probeases (Delbaere et al., 1975). In this case profound structural alterations bring the 168-182 "methionine" loop in close coincidence with the position occupied by the autolysis loop in t,rypsin. Under these conditions Arg169 is in an appropriate orientation to salt link to the buried negative side-chain of Asp194; the activation of the enzyme thus appears to be accomplished at the time of folding through formation of an intramolecular ion pair. In trypsinogen-PST1 the Lys156-Asp194 system seems less likely t'o be related to some functional aspects of the complex. Ile-Val, either as a free dipeptide. or as the two terminal residues of trypsin, has a considerable affinity for its cleft,: it forms four specific hydrogen bonds to different segments of

the pocket, thus carrying over the rigiditication of try@inogen (SW Table 1 of Bode et al., 1978). A simple lysine chain, although binding to the same Asp194 residue, cannot exploit the same functions, and t.hus is likely to be replaced by Ile-Val, which binds substantially more strongly. The association constant for the analogous trypsinogen-BPTI complex has been measured to be about lo5 Me1 (Bode, 1979). In accordance with this hypothesis we find that the crystals of trypsinogen-PST1 shatter when soaked in Ile-Val solutions. In our interpretation the dipeptide removes the Lys156 side-chain from the cleft, inducing structural perturbations in the N-terminal region and in the 20-28 loop, which is the main intermolecular contact area in the crystalline lattice. The trypsin calcium-binding site is well-preserved in the trypsinogen-PST1 complex, even though, in relation to the absence of calcium ions from the crystallization solutions, this site is only 50% occupied. As reported (Bode & Schwager, 1975 ; Fehlhammer et al., 1977) calcium is six-co-ordinated and its ligands are located at the edges of a slightly distorted octahedron; two of the ligands are water molecules (OH661 and OH660). two carbonyl oxygens (Asn72 0 and Va175 0) and the remaining two are contributed by the side-chains of Glu70 and Glu80. In trypsinogen-PST1 the mean Ca-ligand distance is 2.18 A, slightly shorter than in trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975) but identical with that reported for trypsinogen (Fehlhammer et al., 1977). A careful inspection of the final Fourier map shows a possible alternative and minor site for calcium 1.7 A away from its main position. This secondary site is in the middle of a distorted octahedron which, besides 072 and 075, is composed by Glu70 OEl, (~1~77 OE2, Glu80 OEI and OH659. The mean Ca-ligand distance (2.9 A) indicates much less tight interactions: one of the exceeding negative charges of the coordination shell. that of residue 70, may easily be dispersed into the solvent. It is possible that this secondary site may be simply the result of structural changes that occur at resides 74, 77 and 80, and which result in the building up of a second distorted co-ordination octahedron. The CA displacements of residues 77, 78, 79 from the positions they occupy in trypsin are 1.33, 2.40, and 1.88 A, respectively. Most likely this perturbated structure is the result of crystal contacts that occur in t'his area. The only direct interaction with a symmetry-related molecule occurs between Phe82 0 and Asn97 0111. However. the crevice between the two contacting trypsinogen molecules contains a number of ordered water molecules, adjacent to the above-mentioned residues, which mediate their interactions. In the neighbourhood of the 95-106 loop the Fourier maps show an electron density feature that has been interpreted as an ordered dphate ion. The peak is fairly well modulated and shows density for the four oxygen atoms. Its position is well-exposed on the surface of the protein, and it partially bridges with two oxygen at,oms between two equivalent molecules in the crystalline lattice. Only one of the sulphate oxygens (Table 6) is connected to a water molecule. OH658, which in turn hydrogen bonds to Ser84 OG and Gln64 ND2 of a symmetry-related molecule (Fig. 10). From our studies of the trypsinogen- and trypsin-BPTI system we had put forward a two-state model for trypsinogen: free trypsinogen has the activation domain disordered, but is converted to a structure very similar to trypsin upon strong ligand binding (Bode et al.. 1978; Bode, 1979). We were aware that this

model can be only approximately true as there are small but significant differences in some segments when trypsinogen-BPTI and the ternary complex with Ile-Val are compared. In particular the autolysis loop is considerably more mobile in the binary complex compared to the ternary complex. In addition nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown that only in the ternary complex is the spectrum from the trypsin-BPTI complex (Perkins & Wuthrich, 1980). indistinguishable The binary trypsinogen-PST1 complex seems to accentuate this picture even more: the autolysis loop is substantially different in structure from trypsin, as is the 20-28 loop. A particularly conspicuous difference from trypsin is the Lys156-Asp194 salt bridge; the other loops of the activation domain adopt a trypsin-like conformation. Trypsinogen in the complex wit'h PST1 must thus be regarded as a third (or possibly fourth, if we dist,inguish trypsinogen-BPTI from the ternary complex) alternative conformation. However. we have to be aware that in the crystals the 20-28 loop and to a lesser extent the autolysis loop trypsinogen-PST1 participate in crystal contacts, which may alter t)he solution conformation. In the trypsinogen-BPTI complex crystals these loops are free and therefore more likely to represent the minimum energy solution conformation.

The affinity of PST1 for trypsin is high, t,he dissociation constant of t,he complex being approximatjely lo- lo M (Menegatt,i et ~1.. 1981). Preliminary experiments t'o det,ermine the affinity of PST1 for trypsinogen yielded values of Kd = low4 RI (Ascenzi et ~1.. unpublished results). The large difference observed can be ascribed to the energy needed t,o rigidify the activation domain without t,he supporting effect of the Ile-\`a1 S t,erminus.

As can be seen from the CA backbone structure of the complex (Fig. 4) the first nine residues of PST1 are far from trypsinogen and exposed to the solvent. ARer the first disulphide bridge the inhibit,or chain comes into cont,act with the molecular surface of the (pro)enzvme. For ease of discussion complementary Figure 5 gives a schematic view of the PST1 reactive site loop. depicting the local interactions taking place at sites P9 through P3' (see Table 4C). Although some interaction can be observed at site P9, where the carbonyl oxygen of residue Thr310 hydrogen bonds weakly to the side-chain of Asn97 (3.12 A). the first good hydrogen bond occurs two sites further on, at residue Glu312 (P7). where the backbone nitrogen links to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 97. It must be stressed. however. that the rat'her long hydrogen bond found at, site P9 may in our case be biased. The Asn97 side-chain nitrogen also hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen X2 of a symmetry-relat,ed molecule (3.02 A). and it, is quite possible that removal of t,his interaction imposed by t'he crystal would allow better binding to 0310. At site 1'6 the geometry of trypsinogen and PST1 backbones is favourable for a hydrogen bond to occur bet'ween the amido nitrogen of residue Va1311 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asn97: their distance. however, exceeds 35 A. and as the structure shows. the main inberaction at this sit,e occurs between the side-chains, \`a1313 CH, CGI and CG2 atoms are found to lie in a plane stacking 4.2 A over the `l'rp215 indole ring. From residue Ser3l-l t,o Pro317 t,he inhibit'or and trypsinogen chains run along two antiparallel strands, which mimic a twisted @sheet. Site P5. at the beginning of the inhibitor strand. is characterized by complementary h?-tlrogen-l)onding between backbow nitrogen and oxygen of residue Ser314 and the side-chain of Gln175. Again, as in the case of residues 311 and 313, at site P4 residue (ily315 does not show direct links to the enzyme. A bulky group in this position would be difficult to accept by the proenzyme; Gly315 HC14 is nearly at cont,acting distance with the side-chain of Trp215. Inspection of the st,ruature of the neighbouriny residues shows that there is not much room to accommodate this latter side-chain in an alt,ernati\-e conformation. At site 1'3 a pair of hydrogen bonds connect the peptide S and carbonyl 0 of residue (`ys316 to the backbone of residue (>lyPl(i. In view of the role that the 316-33.5 disulphide bridge plays in tixing the conformation of the reactive site loop, and considering the low (`A deviation found at this residue in the comparison with ()M,JJQ3 (Fig. 2). these two hydrogen bonds are likely to be a feature conserved in all the Kazal inhibitor-trypsin complexes. This confirms the hypot'hesis ad\-anced by Papamokos et rll. (I 98%) on the basis of their model building with the ovomucoid inhibitor. At site P2 thv prntatomic~ side-chain ring of Pro317 is perpendicular and close to the imidazole

ring of His57, while the carbonyl oxygen makes an intramolecular hydrogen bond to the side-chain of Asn333. Site Pl contains Lys318, the residue specifically recognized by trypsin. As in the case of the BPTI-trypsin(ogen) complex the side-chain of the reactive site residue fit's into the specificity pocket, hydrogen-bonding two internal water molecules (OH414 and OH416), SerlSO OG and its carbonyl oxygen, and having its positive charge counterbalanced by Asp189. Atom OD2 of the 189 side-chain is 3.33 A from Lys318 NZ. From OH414 and 416 a network of hydrogen bonds extends to the trypsinogen backbone, side-chains, ancl to other ordered solvent molecules ; several of these protein-solvent interactions resemble closely or are coincident with those found in the trypsin-BPTI complex, and are discussed below. The same hydrogenbonding pattern of trypsin-BPTI is found also for main-chain atoms of residue 318; N318 links to the carbonyl oxygen of Ser214, while 0318 links in the oxyanion hole built up by the peptide nitrogens of residues 193 and 195. A contact suggesting a possible hydrogen bond is found as well with t,he Serl95 OG atom (3.14 A). bond, at the Pl' site no major On the amino side of the scissile peptide interactions are found between trypsinogen and the inhibitor. It must, however, be stressed that the Ile319 side-chain undoubtedly serves a purpose : together with the Pro317 pent,atomic ring it prevents the charge relay system area from becoming accessible to external solvent. This is particularly true for the His57 NE2 atom, which is 4.10 A apart from Ile319 CB. At site P2' a good hydrogen bond is found between the backbone nitrogen of Tyr320 and the carbonyl oxygen of His41. Besides. the Tyr320 side-chain is located between the side-chain of Pro152. perpendicular to it with a closest approach of 3.50 A. and the side-chain of Pro322, stacking over it on the opposite side. A third Pro residue encloses Tyr320 in a cagelike pocket open to the solvent at the 320 OEH atom position. The accessibility of this tyrosyl OH and a certain degree of freedom for this residue had been anticipated by DeMarco et al. (1979) on the basis of their temperature and titration nuclear magnetic resonance experimenm. iz hydrogen bond between two sidechains is found at the next residue (site P3') : ND2 atom of Asn321 is at 3.0 A from Tyr39 OEH. From site P4' onwards, no major PSTI-trypsinogen interactions are found. At sites Pl4' to P15', the secondary contact loop, residues Ser332 and Asn333 sidechains build up a polar patch on the surface of the inhibitor that finds a counterpart in residue Gln192 of trypsinogen. Upon complex formation those three residues become buried: the closest approach, however (3.78 A between Ser322 OG and Gln192 SE2), does not indicate. in this case. a strong interaction between enzyme and inhibitor. Nevertheless, at least for some Kazal inhibitors. a certain degree of specific recognition at site P14' has been shown to exist ; the replacement of Ser332 the dissociation rate constant for the reaction of with Gly increases significantly with /%trypsin (Bogard et al.. 1980). Moreover, inhibitors like the OMJPQ3 ovomucoid second domains. which have a bulkier Asp residue at site P14' and are of trypsin. may indeed hydrogen bond directly to the side-chain of strong inhibitors Glnl92. Since the position of the Asn333 side-chain is slightly secluded, such that no direct that, t,he strong we tend to believe contact) takes place with trypsinogen.

conservation of this residue reflects more its intramolecular role rather than a possible surface recognition function. As mentioned above the Asn333 side-chain is fully exploiting its hydrogen-bonding capability with carbonyl oxygens of Pro317 and Ile319 and the amido nitrogen of Va1336. In t'h is way the reactive site loop is anchored t,o the N terminus of the ni-helix. The three hydrogen bonds have an average length of 3.0 A and are conserved w&h comparable strengths in the native OMJPQB structure (Papamokos ef aZ.. 1982). The geometric relationships of the active site residues AsplOB. His57. Serl95 and t,he scissile peptide bonds Lys318Ile319 deserve particular attention. The Asp102 side-chain is hydrogen-bonded to Ser214 OG (2.68 A). His57 X (2.97 A) and His57 SD1 (2.79 A). His57 NE2 forms an excellent. linear hydrogen bond to tier195 OC (2.66 a). The distance of the Ser195 OG to the carbonyl carbon of Lys318 is 2.68 A. The pyramidalization at the carbonpl group of Lys318 is substantial. with a distance of the carbonyl oxygen from the plane formed by 318 CA, 318 C, 319 iY of - 0.27 A ( - indicates the direction away from CB ; this corresponds to an out, of plane angle of - 12.5"). This arrangement is exactly analogous to the situation found in trypsin and trypsinogenBPT1 complexes (Huber & Bode. 1978). In addition we have re-evaluated (in co-operation with J. Deisenhofer and after addit,ional refinement) the degree of pyramidalization of the reactive site peptide of KPTT in the various complexes with t,rypsin and trypsinogen. Our previous results indicat<ing substantial pvramidialization were confirmed qualitatively. The new values are smaller than those previously reported, and similar to those of the PST1 complex. possibly because of the restraints applied now. We were also able to include in this series (in collaboration with ,J. Walter and W. Bode) a very high resolution study (1.4 A) of a smaller inhibitor (p-amidinophengl pyruvic acid) bound to trypsin. This forms a covalent bond between the carbonpl carbon and Serl9)Fi OG. In this complex the degree of pyramidalization is about twice that, observed for trypsinogen-PBTI. (A ma,nuscript describing these studies and including a statistical analysis of peptide geometry in general in these caomplexes is in preparatjion.) We emphasize these results because recent 13C nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Baillargeon et al., 1980: Riclharz ef ~2.. 1980) have shown that there is very little difference in the chemical shift of the reactive site carbonyl carbon of BPTI or soybean trypsin inhibitor in its free state or complexed to trypsin. The authors (*onelude that these experiments rule out the presence of a, fully t,etrahedral carbon, hut admit not to be able to differentiabe between a t,rigonal and a tetrahedralI> dist,ort,cd carbon. as found in the crystallographic investigations. The reason for t)his may be seen in the highly non-linear relation between i3C nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift and carbon geometry (see Fig. 6 of Baillargeon et ~2.. 1980).

The refined model of the trypsinogen-PST1 complex contains 162 solvent peaks. which could be easily interpreted as water molecules. None of them is buried in the inhibit,or, while 48 contribute to the internal struct,ure of trypsinogen and are not

accessible to the external solvent. In this respect PST1 differs from BPTI, which is known to have four water molecules buried in its structure (Deisenhofer & Steigemann. 1975). Part of the solvent' molecules bound to the trypsinogen component of the complex are common to trypsin and trypsinogen-BPTI-Ile-Val structures (Huber et nl. 1 1974 ; Bode et al., 1978). If one considers the whole trppsinogen--PST1 complex. a total of 43 water molecules are found in positions equivalent to those they occupy in trypsin: 28 of them are not accessible to the external solvent and are found mainly within the trypsinogen molecule. If the comparison is carried over with the ternary complex trypsinogen-BPTI-Ile-Val. 35 (26 buried) solvent molecules are found in equivalent positions. A number of ordered water molecules mediate int'eractions between the surfaces of trypsinogen and of PST1 around the conta.ct area (Fig. 4). At, least 15 wat)er molecules were found to form hydrogen bonds to residues neighbouring the contact surface in such a way that they fill the cavity between enzyme and inhibitor and seclude it from the ext,ernal solvent. In addition seven molecules (OH403,OH414,OH416,OH604, OH607,OH608,OH711) connect) directly to PSTI, taking advantage of hydrogen bond donors or trypsinogen by the two partner molecules. Water molerules 414 and 416 acceptors contributed (Fig. 3) form hydrogen bonds to Lys318 NZ (2.98 and 2.94 B. respectively) as found in the trypsinand trypsinogen-BPTI complexes. Another water molecule, which is found at site 1'3 of t)he inhibitor. Here OH403 has an equivalent, in trypsin-BPTT, forming hydrogen bonds to the acts as a bridge between enzyme and inhibit'or. Cys316 carbonyl oxygen (3.33 8). Glnl92 OEl (2.92 ,A) and (Sly216 0 (3.03 A). It is remarkable that despite the structural differences between the two inhibitors, in trypsin-BPTI the same solvent molecule connects the P3 site with the enzyme in almost the same manner (the hydrogen bond to 192 OEl in this case is substituted with a connection to the Gly219 carbonyl oxygen). Two ot,her solvent molecules At site P5 the carbonyl connect. residues of the contact area with trypsinogen. oxygen of Ser314 is hydrogen-bonded to OH71 1 (2.90 A). which in turn interacts with Lys224 r\`Z (3.45 8): OH604 instead is c*onnected to Asn321 0T)l (3.05 A. site P3') a,nd to Tyr39 OEH and Lys60 SZ (2.77 and 2.64 a. respectively). Inspection of t,he interactions between equivalent molecules show that 17 solvent cont,acts. 16 of which occur' on t,he molecules take part, in intermolecular trypsinogen surface.

is the second example for which After BPTI. the Kazal trypsin inhibitor &ructures of the free component (Weber et al., 1981) and of its complexes have been determined and refined at high resolution.

OMJPQ3 the reactive site Lysl8 is exposed to solvent; thus it shows one of the highest (the highest, 46 A2. in molecule 1 of the octamer) main-chain temperature factors of the whole structure (see Fig. 5(b) of Papamokos et aZ.. 1982). In the complexed PST1 the pattern is exactly reversed (Fig. 11). The reactive peptide has one of the lowest temperature factors ; the whole pattern of thermal vibrations along the chain points out that a considerable rigidification of the contact region of the inhibitor has occurred. Most notably this behaviour extends to the residues of trypsinogen facing the inhibitor and partly to the secondary contact region of PSTI. Asn333, a central residue in this area has a B factor identical with that, of Lys318. Conformational rigidity of the reactive site and of its counterpart on the enzyme has been considered as one of the possible causes of inhibitor activity (Ruhlmann of the substrate peptide bond, a et al., 1973). In order to carry over the hydrolysis number of small conformational rearrangements must occur. Between them the relative movement of Ser195 OG and Lys318 C is essential. These atoms must reduce their distance (as observed in the complex) by approximately 1 a to reach the structure of the tetrahedral intermediate (Huber & Bode, 1978). The fact that the distance between the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond and the nucleophile OG of Ser195 is strongly conserved (-2.6 A) in the structures of the

trypsin(ogen)and trypsinogen-PST1 complexes indicates that the trypsin active site is capable of freezing a well-determined structure irrespective of the bound inhibitor chain. Considering the observed pyramidalization at the carbonyl carbon. this structure is slightly shifted towards the tetrahedral intermediate. Ags mentioned above, the st,ructure of a trypsin adduct in which Serl9:i OG is c*ovalent,ly linked to a small inhibit,or. a derivative of' pyruvic acid. has recently become available (Marquart et al.. 1982). The results of this crystallographic investigation st,ress furthermore what has just, been pointed out. In the amidino phenyl pyruric acid adduct the distance between Ser195 OG and the keto carbonyl carbon (a trigonal carbony carbon in the free molecule) is 1.68 4. indicat,ing covalent bonding. Kerertheless the pyramidalization of this centre is far from being complete: the carbonyl oxygen is 0.79 A& out of the plane defined as above by t,he three neighbouring carbons, with an out of plane angle of - 37.2". The active site of trypsin thus apparently not only pre-sets the scissile peptide bond caarbonyl carbon to a tetrahedrally distort'ed configuration. hut). in thr absence of the cao-operative effects from a real substrate, it prrrent,s it from reaching a fully tetrahedral structure. In the trypsinogen--PST1 complex, as IveIl as in the other two complexes of BPTT, t,he inhibitor shields the (rr)active site from the solvent. In particular His57 and Serl95 become fully buried and it is possible that) under these conditions strengthening of the His57 SE%--Serl95 OG hydrogen bond occurs, limiting furthermore the conformational freedom of these two residues. This hydrogen bond is weak or even absent in the free enzyme (Bode B Schwager. 1975). Besides, His57 is close to the side-chains of Pro317 and Ile319: this la&r residue's side-chain that would allow proton forbids movements of His57 imidazole in t,he direction t)ransfer t'o the amido nitrogen of the leaving group. On the basis of the conservation of an antiparallel loop adjacent to t'he reactive site bond in all the serine proteinase inhibitors known (this is not strictly true for soybean trypsin inhibitor. but in this case residues Tyr62 and Ile64 could possibly exploit the it has been proposed (Huber $ Bode, 1978) that the same function). secondary contact, region limits the access of solvent to t,he reactive site area. This stereochemical arrangement, is very well preserved also in the PST1 case. However. it is also possible that the primary function of the secondary contact loop is that of limiting the reactive site conformational freedom and of freezing it in a structure complementary to t,he serine proteinase active site. In this framework the rigidity of the secondary cont,act loop st)ructure is stressed by its peculiar location (sandwiched between t)he p-sheet and t'he %-helix). by the strong hydrogen bonds of the side-chain of Asn333 to carbonyl oxygens of Pro317 and Leu319. by the 16-35 and 24-56 disulphide bridges. and by caonsideration of the temperature factors of the residues t,hat build it up. We believe it is not a coincidence that even in free OMJPQS the main-chain and side-chain B factors of the secondary contact loop residues are between the lowest) in the whole inhibitor. Concerning the basic problem of the features differentiating substrates and inhibitors of serine proteinases we must, consider the following (see Laskowski 8 Kato, 1980): (1) the equilibrium constant between modified and unmodified inhibitors is approximately one (t,he modified inhibitor has t,he reactive site bond nicked), in contrast to peptide

hydrolysis, which usually goes to compktidi: (2) wd (3) both rate constants characterizing the dissociation of the complex to unmodified and modified inhibitors are very small compared to the association rate constants. Point (1) is easily explained as in all the inhibitors analysed so far the P' segment is involved in p-sheet structure and the P segment is linked to the rest of the molecule by a disulphide, as in BPTI, PST1 and Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (but not in the chain ends soybean trypsin inhibitor). Thus, even after modification presumably remain tied to the inhibitor and the entropy gain driving hydrolysis cannot be realized. The strong binding of the native inhibitor (point (2)) and its slow dissociation are related to the preformed ideal binding geometry of the inhibitor reactive site. There is no requirement for freezing a certain conformation when inhibitor and protease associate. Mechanistically dissociation of the intact complex may require simultaneous rupture of many interactions with the protease and consequently a high activation energy. A zipper-like, successive breakage of bonds seem impossible in view of the rigid nature of the inhibitor's reactive site. The slow rat,e of hydrolysis (point (3)) may be associated with the inaccessibility of the catalytic site in the complex, and with the immobilization of the catalyticb residues. It is clear, however, that the problem is more complex and involves structural features of both inhibitor and enzyme. BPTI. for example, is an excellent inhibitor for mammalian trypsin, but a fairly good substrate for a homologous trypsin 1 from starfish (Laskowski & Kato, 1980). We have learned that M. N. G. James and colleagues have analysed the crystal structure of a complex between turkey ovomucoid third domain and Streptomyces griselro protease B (Fujinaga et al.. 1982). The interaction between protease and inhibitor is apparently analogous to that described for t'rypsinogen-PST1 within the limits of comparability of the different proteases. The ovomucoid component structure is very similar to OMJPQ3.
