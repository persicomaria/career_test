ABSTRACT Pleckstrin1 is a major substrate for protein kinase C in platelets and leukocytes, and comprises a central DEP (disheveled, Egl-10, pleckstrin) domain, which is flanked by two PH (pleckstrin homology) domains. DEP domains display a unique / fold and have been implicated in membrane binding utilizing different mechanisms. Using multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree reconstructions, we find that 6 subfamilies of the DEP domain exist, of which pleckstrin represents a novel and distinct subfamily. To clarify structural determinants of the DEP fold and to gain further insight into the role of the DEP domain, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the pleckstrin DEP domain using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Pleckstrin DEP shares main structural features with the DEP domains of disheveled and Epac, which belong to different DEP subfamilies. However, the pleckstrin DEP fold is distinct from these structures and contains an additional, short helix 4 inserted in the 4- 5 loop that exhibits increased backbone mobility as judged by NMR relaxation measurements. Based on sequence conservation, the helix 4 may also be present in the DEP domains of regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins, which are members of the same DEP subfamily. In pleckstrin, the DEP domain is surrounded by two PH domains. Structural analysis and charge complementarity suggest that the DEP domain may interact with the N-terminal PH domain in pleckstrin. Phosphorylation of the PH­DEP linker, which is required for pleckstrin function, could regulate such an intramolecular interaction. This suggests a role of the pleckstrin DEP domain in intramolecular domain interactions, which is distinct from the functions of other DEP domain subfamilies found so far. Proteins 2005;58:354 ­366.

strin.1 In addition, the domain is present in certain kinases, regulators of G-protein signaling proteins (RGSs) and Epac, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor. It is found in many different organisms ranging from yeast to humans, with the number of proteins containing DEP domains varying considerably depending on the organism. For instance, it is quite rare in plants (only one entry for Arabidopsis) but abundant in mammals (64 proteins in humans, 40 in mouse; SMART database),2 albeit present in many paralogue and orthologue proteins. In most cases, DEP domains appear as a single copy, with very few proteins containing 2 domains.3,4 We have grouped all nonredundant DEP domains into 6 distinct subfamilies, comprising some yeast divergent domains, the FYVE containing kinase, the disheveled (dsh) subfamily, RGS proteins, Epac, and pleckstrin, respectively [Fig. 1(a and c)] using a neighborjoining phylogenetic tree. For some of these subfamilies, the fuctional role of the DEP domain has been investigated. In disheveled, dshDEP participates in several signaling pathways, including the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the upregulation of -catenin activity, and the stimulation of Lef-1 mediated transcription.6 ­9 Dsh-DEP has been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic protein prickle, inhibiting disheveled membrane localization and affecting planar cell polarity signaling.10 A deletion of the DEP domain present in the regulator of G-protein signaling 9 (RGS9) prevents the interaction with the transmembrane protein R9AP, a member of the extended SNARE protein family,

again suggesting a possible role in targeting a signaling protein to the membrane surface.11,12 In the case of Epac, its DEP domain seems to mediate membrane localization.13,14 A distinct subfamily of DEP domains is represented by the pleckstrin protein. In mammals, there are 2 paralogue proteins of about 40 kDa, named Pleckstrin1 and Pleckstrin2, that contain a DEP domain surrounded by two PH (pleckstrin homology) domains.15,16 The 2 paralogues are quite sequence divergent, with only 30 identical residues between both DEP domains. Pleckstrin1 is a major substrate for protein kinase C in platelets and leukocytes, and its phosphorylation has been used as a marker for platelet activation.17 Pleckstrin2, on the contrary, is found in a wide range of cell types, suggesting that it plays a more general role in signaling. Pleckstrin1 affects second messenger­ based signaling events mediated by phosphatidyl-inositol 3 -kinase (PKC) and 5 inositol phosphatase I.18 In contrast to most other proteins studied so far the pleckstrin DEP (pleck-DEP) domain does not seem to be directly involved in membrane localization of the protein, and its molecular function remains unclear. Two structures of DEP domains of mouse disheveled19 and of mouse Epac,20 the guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)binding proteins Rap1 and Rap2, have been determined. The domain displays a characteristic / fold. In both structures, the helical core of the domain is conserved but, interestingly, significant differences are observed in the -sheet elements that preclude the use of the known structures as templates for modeling other DEP sequences. Since the pleck-DEP domain belongs to a different sequence subfamily, it seems likely that its (molecular) function may be distinct from other subfamilies, and that these particular characteristics are reflected at the structural level. In order to gain insight into the molecular functions of the pleck-DEP domain and the associated subfamily, we studied the three-dimensional (3D) structure and backbone dynamics of the pleck-DEP domain by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR. METHODS Definition of Domain Boundaries Previously, a biophysical characterization of various fragments comprising the predicted pleck-DEP domain suggested that additional residues outside the initial boundaries were required to obtain folded samples.21 To optimize sample conditions for the NMR studies, we prepared 4 different protein constructs and analyzed them by NMR. The construct comprising the region predicted by SMART as the pleck-DEP domain (138 ­243), is unstructured. Expanded constructs comprising residues 122­223, 122­229, and 122­243 are all folded in solution. The constructs 122­229 and 122­243 contain several disordered residues, as deduced from heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments, and we therefore selected the region containing residues 122­223 for the structure determination. This selection is in agreement

with the previously reported disheveled and Epac DEP structures. Sample Preparation The nucleotide sequence encoding the pleckstrin DEP domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Homo sapiens cDNA as template. The shorter constructs were obtained by PCR using the previous one as template with appropriated primers. The recombinant proteins were expressed using pET9d or pETM30 vectors in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. Unlabeled protein or uniformly 15N and/or 15N, 13C double-labeled proteins were produced by growing the bacteria at 37°C for 3 h, either in Luria­Bertani (LB) or in minimal medium (M9) using 15NH4Cl and 13C6-D-glucose as source of nitrogen and carbon. N-His proteins were purified using a single step Ni2 affinity chromatography. The N-His-GST-fusion proteins were first purified using Ni2 affinity chromatography, and the domain of interest was cleaved from the fusion protein with N-hisTEV (tobacco etch virus) protease at room temperature during 10 h. Both fusion protein and protease were mostly removed using a second Ni2 affinity chromatography, and the domain was finally purified and buffer exchanged on a Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column. The purity of the proteins was ensured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE), and the molecular masses were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Samples for the NMR experiments were 1.5 mM concentration of protein in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 30 mM NaCl, 3 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.03% (w/v) NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O, respectively, at pH 6.5. The same buffer conditions but a 1.1 mM 15N-labeled sample, were used for the relaxation experiments. Equilibrium Sedimentation Equilibrium sedimentation data for the pleck-DEP sample containing residues 122­223 were measured at 277 K on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Inc.) equipped with a An60Ti rotor. A 0.12 mL sample of a 0.3 mM concentration in NMR buffer solution was loaded into a 12-mm aluminium centerpiece with quartz optical windows. All data were monitored at 280 nm at rotor speeds of 47,000 rpm. Samples came to equilibrium after 24 h of centrifugation, as determined by perfect superposition of scans taken at 3-h intervals. A molecular mass of 11545 23 Da was obtained from the sedimentation equilibrium data, similar to the monomeric theoretical mass of 11,772 Da. This indicates that the concentration used to analyze the dynamic properties of the pleck-DEP domain corresponds to a monomeric state and was also confirmed by NMR measurements (see below). NMR Spectroscopy All experiments were carried out at 295 K on either Bruker DRX-500 or DRX-600 NMR spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance gradient probes. For the backbone

assignment 1H-15N-HSQC, HNCA, CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCO spectra were recorded. Aliphatic side-chain assignments were obtained from H(CC)(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy) and HBHACONH experiments, and aromatic side-chain assignments from 2D homonuclear TOCSY and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) together with HBCBCCDHD, HBCBCCDCEHE, and 3D 13C-edited TOCSY spectra.22,23 Identification of slowly exchanging

A 1H-15N-HNHA experiment24 was used to derive the 3J(HN,H ) coupling constants, used to calculate dihedral angles.

recorded with a 2-s interscan delay followed by either 3 s of proton saturation using a series of 120° 1H pulses or an additional 3-s delay. Relaxation rates were fitted using a nonlinear least-squares routine implemented in NMRView.31 Peak intensity errors were estimated from the standard deviation of the noise. Error intervals for the relaxation rates comprise 95% of the values obtained from a Monte Carlo analysis using 100 simulated data series per decay. Dynamical parameters for each NH bond vector were obtained using the Lipari­Szabo approach and extensions: Model 1: order parameter S2, neglible internal motion; Model 2: order parameter S2, internal motion with correlation time e; Model 3: order parameter S2, exchange induced relaxation present (Rex), internal motions are negligible; Model 4: order parameter S2, fast internal motion ( e) and exchange relaxation (Rex) are present; 2 Model 5: two order parameters (S2 and Ss ) describing amplitudes of fast and slow internal motions and a correlation time associated with slow internal motions ( S) are used to describe the dynamics. The model selection based on statistical methods was performed using the programs ModelFree32 and TENSOR.33 Data reported are for an axial symmetric rotational diffusion tensor with c 7.8 ns and D /D 1.18. Structure Calculation The experimentally determined distance and dihedral angle restraints (Table I) were included in a simulated annealing protocol using ARIA37/CNS.38 Structures were calculated in 7 iterations, with 20 structures per iteration.39 In the final iteration, 100 structures were calculated and the 14 best were used for water refinement.40 After the third iteration, 74 residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints were included. The final structure calculations included a total of 1815 manually assigned NOEs and 35 ambiguous NOEs assigned by ARIA. A total of 34 hydrogen-bond constraints were obtained by recording a series of 15N-edited HSQC spectra taken after the addition

of D2O to a lyophilized sample. Dihedral angle constraints 31 and 13 1 were derived from the experimentally measured 3J(HN,H )24 and 3J(N,C ),41 respectively. RDCs were applied as described.42 Structural quality was evaluated using PROCHECK.34 Calculations using RDCs and without them yielded similar structures. A superposition of the best structure calculated using all measured RDCs, only some located at the secondary structural elements or none display a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value ° of 0.6 A (data not shown). DEP sequences were retrieved from (http://smart. embl-heidelberg.de). The chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank database (http:// www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under the accession number 6385. Chemical shifts reported in this work when compared to the values present in the BMRB database mostly fall into the standard deviation of the mean chemical shift value. The coordinates are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 1w4m). RESULTS NMR Data and Restraints Used for the Structure Calculation Backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained using a combination of standard heteronuclear multidimensional NMR experiments performed on 15N and 13C isotopically labeled samples. 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments are almost complete, and only those corresponding to backbone nitrogens of prolines or carbonyls of residues preceding prolines could not be obtained. Restraints for the structure calculation were determined from 15N and 13C NOESY experiments, 3J(HN,H ) couplings, hydrogen exchange experiments, and 1H-15N RDCs. 1HN-15N residual dipolar couplings were measured using a 15N-labeled sample (400 L 0.7 mM at pH 6.5) dissolved in 5% (w/v) DMPC/DHPC in a 3:1 molar ratio. The secondary structure elements were identified by the pattern of NOEs,

energy structures in Figure 3(a). Table I summarizes the structural statistics for these structures. The structure of the DEP domain comprises a 103-residue / fold with 1- 1- 2- 3- 2- 4- 4- 5 topology. The three helices, 1, 2, and 3, are nearly perpendicular to one another ( 110°) and form a network of conserved aromatic and hydrophobic residues that constitute the core of the domain. A ribbon representation of the domain is shown in Figure 3(b). The 5 strands have 4 residues each and are distributed into 2 perpendicular antiparallel -sheets located on top of the 3 helices. The 2 first strands, 1 (23­27) and 2 (30 ­33), form a -hairpin. The hairpin is maintained by a network of side-chain interactions and 2 pairs of hydrogen bonds detected in H/D exchange experiments depicted in Figure 2. This hairpin shows few but key contacts to the triple-stranded -sheet defining its relative orientation. In particular, L25, K27 ( 1), and F32 ( 2) side-chains show NOEs with F96 and Y98 ( 3) aromatic rings. However, these contacts are not sufficient to fully restrict the freedom of the hairpin. This freedom is reflected in the variability observed for this region in the backbone superposition shown in Figure 3(a). Moreover, the relaxation data indicate motions in the milli- to microsecond timescale for the hairpin. The sequential strands 2 and 3 are separated by a kink introduced at His34, which changes the orientation of the triple stranded -sheet ( 3, 34 ­38; 4, 70 ­73; and 5, 96 ­99) with respect to the hairpin by 90°. The positioning of the strands is maintained by contacts between 4 hydrophobic residues, F36, L65, Y97 and F99, of the triple-stranded antiparallel -sheet to the protein core formed by the 3 helices. A distinct feature of all DEP domains is the presence of 2 long loops, one that connects helix 1 to the 1 strand, and the other that connects the last 2 strands of the second -sheet. In the case of pleck-DEP, this second loop contains 20 residues and is one of the longest found in the DEP family. The N-terminal region of pleck-DEP folds into a small turn followed by the short helix 4 (75­ 80), whereas the region spanning residues 80 ­ 87 is disordered. The last part of this loop (residues 88 ­94) is well defined in the 3D structure even in the absence of regular secondary structure. It packs against the core of the DEP domain and defines a hydrophobic pocket between F89 [one of the best-conserved residues in this loop; Figs. 1(a) and 3(b)] and residues V41,I42 from helix 2, and L58,L65 from helix 3, respectively. In addition, the presence of an unusual NOE between the Y97 hydroxyl group and the backbone amide proton of L90 was detected. As frequently observed in signaling domains, both protein termini lie on one side of the molecule. Backbone Dynamics The long loops in the DEP domain and the restricted number of NOEs observed in certain parts of the sequence suggest that conformational dynamics could be present. To characterize such dynamics of the peptide backbone we measured 15N R1, R2, and {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values in the pleck-DEP domain. Heteronuclear NOE relaxation is sensitive to backbone motions occurring on a subnanosecond to nanosecond timescale, while R2 values can detect even slower motions.44,45 From sedimentation

equilibrium experiments [Fig. 4(a)] and NMR data recorded at concentrations used for the relaxation measurements, the pleck-DEP domain is monomeric. Analysis of the relaxation rates for the DEP domain show reduced NOE and R2 values for the region comprising the long 4- 5 loop, indicating an increased mobility on the picosecond timescale [Fig. 4(b)]. In contrast, residues in the short turn connecting 2 and 3, and residues in the 1, 2 hairpin exhibit an increased transverse relaxation rate. Especially, K27 at the tip of the -hairpin exhibits an increased R2 rate at 500 MHz, and the amide signal of D28 is only visible at 600 MHz and broaden beyond detection at 500 MHz, presumably due intermediate exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale. This is indicative of backbone motions on milli- to microsecond timescales. We analyzed the relaxation data according to the Lipari­Szabo model-free formalism.46 The dynamic parameters (see Supplementary Material) point to 3 regions of the molecule that exhibit significant internal motions: (1) the region comprising the 1- 1 loop and the -hairpin arm, (2) the short turn connecting helices 2 and 3, and (3) the region between 3 and 4, which includes helix 4 and the following long loop. Notably, both the -hairpin arm and the 2- 3 loop exhibit very large R2 relaxation rates, and the Lipari­Szabo analysis indicates milli- to microsecond backbone dynamics for these residues. Furthermore, helix 4, which is unique for the pleckstrin subfamily of DEP domains, has a significantly lower order parameter than all other secondary structure elements, indicating fast backbone motions of this secondary structure element. Both the slow dynamics of the -hairpin and the higher mobility of helix 4 suggest that these neigboring regions may play a role in mediating molecular interactions of the DEP domain. Distinct Structural Features in the Three DEP Fold Subfamilies The two previously determined structures of DEP domains, namely, that of Epac, obtained by X-ray crystallography, and that of disheveled, determined by NMR in

solution, exhibit common structural features characteristic of the DEP-domain fold: the core formed by 3 helices, the -hairpin connecting 1 and 2, and 2 antiparallel strands after 3. However, when both structures are superimposed, only 2 and 3 are easily overlaid (RMSD ° 2 A).20 Two main differences are the location of the -hairpin with respect to the -sheet, and the makeup of the -sheet itself. In the first case, it is a triple-stranded, antiparallel -sheet, while in dsh-DEP, one of the strands is not present in the structure. Pleck-DEP shares the main structural features with the 2 previously determined structures, as represented in Figure 5(a and b) showing the pleck-DEP structure superimposed to either dsh-DEP or to Epac-DEP. Indeed, the pleck-DEP structure is very similar to that of Epac-DEP, with the helical core and the triple-stranded -sheet ° overlaying well (RMSD 2 A). Even the -hairpin is located in a similar position and orientation in both of these structures. The superposition between pleck-DEP and dsh-DEP, on the other hand, is as difficult as was previously reported for the Epac- and dsh-DEP domain superposition. Only the helical part is equivalent in both ° structures (RMSD 2 A) with the -hairpin differently oriented, twisted by nearly 90° with respect to each other. In addition, the loop connecting the hairpin to 3 is unstructured in dsh-DEP, while it forms a -strand in pleck-DEP and Epac-DEP. A characteristic set of NOEs is observed for residues located in 3 and 4, indicating that both strands are present in pleck-DEP and arranged in an antiparallel manner, forming, together with 5, the triplestranded -sheet (Fig. 2). C and C secondary chemical shifts, the analysis of 3J(HN,H ) couplings, and our analysis of the backbone dynamics support the presence of the 3 strand, since no flexibility is observed for the residues forming the triple-stranded -sheet [Fig. 4(b) and Supplementary Material].

Significantly, pleck-DEP contains an additional short helix, 4, which is absent in the other two structures. This helix is located in the loop that connects 4 to 5. According to the sequence alignment, the loop is extraordinarily long in pleckstrin (20 amino acids) in contrast to other DEP sequences (10 residues on average). Only members of the RGS-DEP subfamily also present a longer loop (about 16 residues), with a hydrophobic pattern of residues suitable for adopting a helical conformation. The likely existence of a similar short helix in the RGS-DEP subfamily is supported by the observation that pleck-DEP and RGS-DEP sequences are grouped together in the phylogenetic tree [Fig. 1(b)]. The fact that helix 4 is only present in pleckstrin, and possibly in the RGS family, suggests that it may have a specific function, perhaps in mediating protein­protein recognition. This is consistent with the low-order parameters derived from the 15N relaxation analysis indicating some conformational plasticity, which might allow for an induced fit upon engaging in molecular interactions. Increased backbone mobility is known to play a role in protein­protein interactions.47 Thus, the enhanced dynamics observed for structural elements, including helix 4 and the -hairpin, which exhibits motion on millisecond timescales, support the notion that the DEP domain is involved in intra- or intermolecular interactions. In addition to the structural differences described above, specific peculiarities can be detected upon analysis of the surface charge distributions of the 3 DEP structures. The surface potentials were calculated with MOLMOL and are shown in Figure 6. Comparison of the charge distribution indicates that the pleck-DEP surface has a clear and extensive negative patch formed by 4 and the long 4- 5 loop [Fig. 6(a and b)]. Epac-DEP has positive and negative patches equally distributed on the surface [Fig. 6(d and e)], and dsh-DEP has a solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch mainly formed by aromatic residues located in the last

strand [Fig. 6(c)]. These residues are conserved in the DEP domains but are less solvent-exposed in pleck-DEP and Epac-DEP, since they are covered by the -hairpin. Furthermore, an electrostatic dipole comprising residues in the -hairpin and helix 2, which has been suggested to participate in molecular interactions,19 seems

unique for the disheveled subfamily [Fig. 6(c)]. The positive side of the dipole is made up by a lysine located in the 1- 2 loop. This lysine is only present in some DEP sequences, and its mutation to methionine in fruit fly causes a well-defined phenotype.7 The negative end of the dipole is located at the N-terminus of helix 2. Remark-

ably, in both pleck- and Epac-DEP subfamilies, the lysine and also one of the negatively charged residues located at 2 are conserved, but the dipole is absent or not pronounced, since the -hairpin has a different direction compared to dsh-DEP. Furthermore, several DEP sequences, for instance, the RGS-DEP subfamily, do not contain these residues [Fig. 1(a)], suggesting that only dsh-DEP may contain this dipole. In addition to the lack of dipole, a positively charged patch located around helix 3 in dsh-DEP, which has been hypothesized to mediate membrane interactions, is absent in the Epac- and pleck-DEP surfaces. In Epac- and pleckDEP, helix 3 contains a single positive residue, suggesting that electrostatic interactions with the membrane are not a general feature of all DEP domains. In Epac-DEP, the region comprising helices 2 and 3 is quite hydrophobic [Fig. 6(d)]. In the Epac structure, this surface is partially shielded by the packing of 2 additional helices outside the Epac-DEP domain [Fig. 6(e)]. Based on the tight packing of these additional helices with the DEP fold, it is likely that the Epac-DEP domain may require these additional helices to stabilize the 3D structure. In contrast, when analyzing C-terminally extended constructs of the pleck-DEP domain (residues 121­229 and 121­243) by NMR (data not shown), no additional secondary structure was detectable, and the fold of the DEP domain was unaffected. This suggests that the pleck-DEP fold does not require the presence of additional secondary structure elements for stabilization. DISCUSSION Distinct molecular functions of pleck-DEP domain compared to dsh- and Epac-DEP subfamilies are hinted by the structural differences observed. These differences include the relative orientation of the -hairpin with respect to the -sheet and the presence of an additional helix 4, which exhibits increased conformational dynamics and is unique to the pleckstrin DEP domain. In addition, a negatively charged patch is located at the pleck-DEP surface near helix 4. It is likely that these peculiarities correlate with pleckstrin-specific molecular interactions, which also involve the DEP domain. Up to now, several DEP domains have been implicated in binding to membranes, either through a direct interaction with the membrane, or through contacts to other membrane-associated proteins. In the case of pleck-DEP, the first possibility is quite improbable, since the domain surface is negatively charged, thus precluding a direct binding to a negatively charged membrane. Indeed, the interaction with membrane-attached PIP2 described for pleckstrin involves the first PH domain.48 The residues involved in the binding are mainly lysines that are located in the N-terminal half of the PH domain, forming a positively charged cluster. Taking into account the complementarity of electrostatic charge of the PH and the DEP domains in pleckstrin, an intramolecular interaction involving the 2 surfaces is conceivable. In fact, NMR-based IP3-binding experiments comparing the PH domain alone and a pleckstrin construct spanning the PH and the DEP

domains indicate that the phosphoinositide binding site of the PH domain within a PH-DEP construct is sterically blocked. While, as expected, the construct containing the PH domain is able to interact with IP3, the PH-DEP fragment is unable to do so (data not shown). These data suggest that an intramolecular interaction between the PH and DEP domains exists, which shields the phosphoinositide binding site in the PH domain. In this respect, it is interesting to note that phosphorylation of the linker connecting the PH and the DEP domain by PKC is required for pleckstrin function and membrane localization.49 ­51 It is thus conceivable that an induced conformational change upon phosphorylation could regulate the intramolecular PH-DEP interaction, liberating the phosphoinositide binding site of the PH domain. We also note that recent evidence suggests that membrane targeting by PH domains may involve direct interaction with membrane-bound proteins.52­53 Therefore, it is possible that in addition to the intramolecular interaction discussed above, the pleck-DEP domain could contribute to such intermolecular interactions directly or indirectly after activation upon phosphorylation. Additional experiments are under way to study these possibilities. CONCLUSIONS We have characterized the structure and molecular properties of the human pleck-DEP domain in solution by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. This fold exhibits distinct features, and both amino acid sequence and the 3D structure indicate that the pleck-DEP domain, together with DEP domains in RGS proteins, define a subfamily of the DEP fold. The molecular functions of the DEP domains in these proteins are likely to be distinct from other members of the DEP family. Our data suggests that in pleckstrin, the DEP domain is implicated in an intramolecular interaction with its N-terminal PH domain. These new perspectives provide an avenue for future studies of the molecular functions of the pleck-DEP domain and, eventually, to an understanding of the functional roles of Pleckstrin1 in platelets.
