Glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3. 1,4-a-D-glucan glucohydrolase) catalyses the release of ,a-D-glucose from the non-reducing ends of starch and related oligo- and polysaccharides. Aspergillus niger produces mai~'!y two forms, glucoamylase 2 and the larger glucoamylase 1 tG1). The latter can bind to and hydrolyse granular starch, and consists of two di~rete, functional domains: a catalytic domain containing the active site and a granular starch binding domain [1-41. The binding domain is contained in the C-terminal region of GI and can he produced by proteolysis of GI [2]. The binding domain has been shown to be homologous with similar domains from a variety of microbial starch-degrading enzymes 131. The binding and catalytic domains are separated by a 'hinge' region, with a high content of Ser and Thr residues which are O-glycosylated v,ith short mannt~erich oligosaccharides 14]. Although there is no sequence homology, this molecular architecture is similar to celIobiohydrolase IEC 3.2.1.91 ). which is also an ex~-oc'mg enzyme, but specific for the B1.4 linkages of cellulose 15]. In both glucoamylase and cellobiohydrolase, the binding domain facilitates hydrolysis of insoluble substrates, although catalysis occurs only at the active site. 1~ has been suggested 16] that the binding domain of

glucoamylase cnntrihules to calals~,i', by disrupting the hydrogen-bonds of adjacent al.4-1inked glucan chains in granular starch. This v.-ould increase substrale availability and decrease the totherwi~ I'~rgeb acti~'ation energy of catalysis. Such a mechanism is. however. controversial. In addition, the binding site may also increase the protein concentration at the surface of the substrate. Hoaever. elucidation of the mechanism has been extremely difficult using (ill-defined) ins~tuble or c~stalline substrates. Furthermore. the exact k,cation of the binding domain is disputed in the literature. Svensson and co-workers 13] report Ih;Jt the binding domain of A. hisser G1 is the (.'-terminal 103 amino acids 1514- 616). v,hereas Ha?,a~,hida'.~group 17] i~lated a different fragment l'ra,~-~tarch-affinity-site', re:,.idues 470-514~ from G1 of .4. m~amort ( > 97~ homologous to A. ntger G1). The latter peptide binds to starch, but contains a large portion of the putati,.e "hinge" regmn [41. GIC contains both of these regions t2l. and hence the experiments reported here do not explicitly distinguish betv.een either region Recent studi~ 181 have shown that n-cyclodextnn inhibited granular starch dig. ~fion by Bacillus subtilis 65 a-amylase.

SavcFc~ ct al. [9] demonstrated that fl-cyclodextrin elutcd glucoamylase (from A~pergillus awamori) from March granules, hut did not protect the catalytic site from chemical modification. In this report we prove that ti~c isolated granular starch binding domain can bind #-cyclodextrin in addition to insoluble substrates. The tight binding of this ligand involves a change in the absorbance of aromatic residues in the binding domain, and provides an ~)pportunity to determine the mechanista t~: action ol the granular starch binding domain. Glucoamylase 1 (G1) was purified from crude Aspergilhts niger glucoamylase (6100 tt/ml, Sigma) as described by Subbaram~iah and Sharma [10]. The Cterminal, granular-starch-binding domain of G1 was prepared as de,~crihed earlier [21. The concentration of G1 and G1C was determined spectrophotomelrically using ~>, = 1.37.10 ~ [ll] and 3.07.104 M t cm 1 [2]. respectively, and molecular weights 82000 [12] and 25 000 J2]. rcspectkely. #-cyclodextrin (cycloheptaamylose) and corn starch were purchased from Sigma, All reagents were of analytical grade. The amount of B" c~clodextrin was estimated by weighing after drying for 16 h at 50~C. UV-difference spectra of GI or G1C were measured with a Beckman DU-70 spcctrophotometer at 25°C using 8 mm pathlength double chamber cuvettes. For each ligand concentration 5 spectra were recorded from 315 to 245 nm at 300 nm/mln. The spectra were averaged znd smoothed, using a Sovitsky-Golay sm~thing function with an add 17-point smooth, using Beckman DU Data Leader software. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 Luminescence spectrometer. Fluorescence emission was recorded from 300 to 400 nm with excitation at 280 nm. Fig, I shows UV difference spectra obtained during the titration of GI wi~h fl-cyc!ode~trin, showing perturhation of absorbance of aromatic amino acids. ~ h e n the height of the peak at 286 nm relative to the troughs at 281 and 290 .,am was plotted against the molar ratio

of fl-cyclodextri,a to G1 (Fig. 2), the stoichioraetry at saturating B-cyclodextrin concentration (after correction for water of hydration in the fl-cyclodextrin) showed that G1 bound 1.96 tool of fl-cyclodextrin per tool of protein. GIC was also titrated with fl-cyclodextrin (Fig. 3). The absorbanee changes are qualitatively very similar to those of GI with fl-cyclodextrin in Fig. 1, again indicating a change in aromatic absorbance. The stoichiometry of the interaction (1.98 tool/tool, corrected as above, Fig, 2) was almost identical to that of GI. This indicates that only the binding site and not the catalytic site of G1 interacts with fl-cyclodextrin over the concentration range measured. Monma et al. [131 reported inhibition constants for a-, fl- and "/-cyclodextrin with Chalara paradoxa glucoamylase of 8.9, 1,4 and 3.9 mM, respectively, indicating that cyclodextrins

interact weakly with the catalytic site of some glucoamylases. However, when the data for G1C is plotted as a Scatchard plot (Fig. 4), a straight line is obtained with appareot Kj = 1.68 ,aM, i.e. three orders of magnitude lower than that measured by Monma et al. [13]. This value is probably the Kj for the interaction of the 2nd cyclodextrin with GIC, since up to 1 tool ligand/mol enzyme, the amount of free ligand is too small to be calculated. The dissociation constants of maltooligosaccharides to the active site of Rhizopus glucoamylase has been examined by fluorimetry [14]. The tightest binding was for maltopentaose ( K d = 82 #M). This is considerably weaker than the interaction of ,8-cyclodextrin with the binding site of the Aspergillus enzyme, and highlights the tight binding of the granular starch binding site. The binding of maltooligosaccharides to glucoamylase decreases the fluorescence at 340 nm. However. no decrease in fluorescence could be detected when flcyclodextrin was added in excess to G1 ,)r G1C (data not shown). This suggests that the interaction of this ligand only gives rise to an absorbance change. The unusual phenomenon is under further investigation. In contrast to ,8.cyclodextrin, the substrate analogue acarbose only binds to the catalytic site of A. roger G1, as shown by chemical modification studies [11,15]. Therefore, for a given ligand it is possible that interaction can occur at either the binding site, or the catalytic site, or both. In mechanistic studies it is vitally important to determine the site of binding of a given ligand, before valid conclusions can be reached. In order to determine whether ,8-cyclodextrin binds at the same site as granular starch, various concentrations of B-cyeledextrin. 0 to 160 ,aM, were added to a mixture containing G1C and granular starch. In preliminary experiments, /~-cyclodextrin inhibited the adsorption of GIC onto granular starch (data not shown). The pH chosen (3.6) was optimal for binding of G1 to granular starch. To determine the type of inhibitory effect, various concentrations of granular starch were incubated together with GI C and several concentrations of/3-cyclodextfin (Fig. 5!. The values obtained v.ere: maximum amount of GIC adsorbed onto starch, 116 -+

From these data. the inhibition by ,8cyclodextrin of adsorption of G1C onto granular starch was purely competitive ,ith an apparent inhibition constant of 11.0 -+ 1.9/~M. This shows that the binding of cyclodextrin is at the same site(s) as the granular starch. Savel'ev et al. [16] reported a value of 5.6 ,aM for the interaction of ,8-cyclodextrin with the binding domain of G1. The difference may reflect a real difference upon removal of the catalytic domain, or may be dependent on the methods used equilibrium gel filtration compared to the more direct absorbance measurements used in this paper. The mechanism by v,hich enz)mes interact with insoluble substrates is poorly understood, since mechanistic studies are difficult owing to the nature of poorly defined solid substratcs. The~e r~,oults show that t'.~e use of small, soluble substrate molecules will allow further investigation of the binding site of glucoamylase binding domains. Other highly homologous binding domains from a-amylases, cyclode,~trin glucanotransferases and other microbial amylases [3] may also have the same mechanism. Furthermore. it is possible that the binding domains of cellobiohydrolases and xylanases, which share several similarities with glucoamylases [1.6.17]. rna3 also bind soluble cellooligosaccharides.
