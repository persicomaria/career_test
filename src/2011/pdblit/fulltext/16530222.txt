Although both dimers can serve as a coreceptor for T cell activation and differentiation, they are different in several aspects. For example, the cellular distributions of CD8aa and CD8ab are distinct and their ligand binding partners are unique. While CD8ab is expressed primarily on the surface of TCRab+ thymocytes and peripheral T cells, CD8aa exhibits a much broader tissue expression pattern (Norment and Littman, 1988; Panaccio et al., 1987; Shiue et al., 1988; Torres-Nagel et al., 1992). CD8aa is found on certain peripheral TCRgd+ T cells, a subset of dendritic cells (DC) and NK1.1+ T cells, as well as on a large fraction of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (including TCRab+ T cells expressing CD8ab+ or CD4+, as well as double-negative [DN] T cells and even TCRgd+ T cells) (Gangadharan and Cheroutre, 2004; Hayday et al., 2001). In addition, both CD8aa and CD8ab interact with classical MHCIa molecules with similar affinity. CD8aa also binds to the nonclassical MHCIb molecule, TL, with greater affinity than to classical MHCI molecules, suggesting that the homodimer may mediate different function(s) other than coreceptor (Leishman et al., 2001; Madakamutil et al., 2004; Weber et al., 2002). Furthermore, CD8ab and CD8aa have different efficiency in enhancing antigen presentation. The extracellular domain of each CD8a and CD8b subunit consists of an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain and a stalk region of 30­45 amino acids in length (reviewed in Zamoyska, 1994). Both the cytoplasmic tail and the extracellular fragment of the CD8b subunit have been implicated in the molecular process that makes CD8ab a more sensitive coreceptor than CD8aa (Bosselut et al., 2000; Luescher et al., 1995; Renard et al., 1996; Wheeler et al., 1992; Witte et al., 1999; Wong et al., 2003). It has been suggested that palmitoylation of a cysteine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of CD8b during T cell activation facilitates CD8ab heterodimers partition into lipid rafts and their association with the CD3 component of TCR complexes (Arcaro et al., 2001). The association of p56lck with the cytoplasmic domain of CD8a and the specific enzymatic activity of p56lck was augmented by CD8b (Irie et al., 1995). Furthermore, the O-linked glycans associated with the membrane-proximal portion of CD8b stalk region exhibit a differentiation-dependent sialylation pattern that may modulate the intrinsic activity of CD8ab during the transition from double-positive (CD4+CD8+) to single-positive (CD8+) thymocytes (Merry et al., 2003; Moody et al., 2001; Priatel et al., 2000). In studies of CD8 ectodomain chimeric molecules, introduction of the CD8b stalk region is sufficient to confer CD8ab-like coreceptor efficiency to the CD8aa homodimer (Wong et al., 2003). We had previously expressed the Ig-like domains of CD8 appended to a leucine zipper (CD8aa-LZ and CD8ab-LZ) in the CHO-Lec3.2.8.1 cell system and obtained a crystal complex of mCD8aa/H-2Kb (Kern et al., 1999). In addition, structures of complexes of human CD8aa with HLA-A2 and mouse CD8aa with the nonclassical MHC molecule, TL, were obtained (Gao et al.,

Summary The crystal structure of a recombinant mouse single ° chain CD8ab ectodomains at 2.4 A resolution reveals paired immunoglobulin variable region-like domains with a striking resemblance to CD8aa in size, shape, and surface electrostatic potential of complementaritydetermining regions (CDR), despite <20% sequence identity between the CD8a and CD8b subunits. Unlike the CD8a subunit(s) in the heterodimer or homodimer, the CDR1 loop of CD8b tilts away from its corresponding CDR2 and CDR3 loops. Consistent with this observation, independent mutational studies reveal that alanine substitutions of residues in the CDR1 loop of CD8b have no effect on CD8ab coreceptor function, whereas mutations in CD8b CDR2 and CDR3 loops abolish CD8ab coreceptor activity. The implications of these findings and additional CD8a mutational studies for CD8ab- versus CD8aa-MHCI binding are discussed. Introduction CD8 plays a critical role in cytolytic T lymphocytes. Simultaneous engagement of a single peptide-MHC class I (pMHCI) complex by a T cell receptor (TCR) and CD8 via a bidentate attachment to an MHC class I molecule on target cells (or antigen-presenting cells) is required for optimal T cell stimulation (Connolly et al., 1990; Salter et al., 1990). In the absence of CD8/pMHCI interaction, MHC class I-restricted immune responses, including cytokine production and cytotoxic effector function, are selectively hampered (Crooks and Littman, 1994; Fung-Leung et al., 1991; Nakayama et al., 1994). Thus, CD8 functions as a coreceptor of the TCR to coordinate antigen-specific recognition. CD8 is expressed either as a CD8ab heterodimer or a CD8aa homodimer on the T cell surface (Carrasco

1997; Liu et al., 2003). Both human and mouse CD8aa bind classical and nonclassical MHC class I in an asymmetric fashion, with the ``top'' CD8a1 subunit sitting beneath the MHCI a2 domain and the ``bottom'' CD8a2 subunit making fewer MHCI contacts. In contrast, the structures of CD8ab or CD8ab in complex with MHCI have been difficult to obtain. In the current study, we have designed, expressed, and crystallized a single chain mouse CD8ab Ig-like domains, termed scmCD8ab, produced in the CHO-Lec3.2.8.1 cell system. This mCD8ab crystal structure allows comparison of the architectural details of CD8aa and CD8ab proteins. Independent sitedirected mutational analyses of CD8ab support the insights into the nature of CD8ab heterodimer binding to MHCI derived from the crystal structure analyses.

Results Overall Structure of Mouse CD8ab Heterodimer A recombinant single chain mouse CD8ab, scmCD8abL29, consisting of the CD8a Ig-like domain (residues 1­124) connected to the CD8b Ig-like domain (residues 1­115) via a 29 amino acid linker peptide was crystallized as thin needles at pH 8.5. The structure of scmCD8abL29 ° was determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.4 A resolution by molecular replacement by use of the CD8a protomer from CD8aa structure as a search model (PDB code 1BQH). Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. In one asymmetric unit of the crystal, there are two scmCD8abL29 chains that are related by an improper rotation. Only seven linker residues can be seen N-terminal to the CD8b subunit in electron density maps, and the remaining 22 linker residues are in disorder, presumably due to its inherent flexibility. Therefore, it is likely that the linker in the single chain construct does not impose any constraint on the natural structure of the CD8ab heterodimer. The two heterodimers in one asymmetric unit are similar to each other. The overall rmsd between the two dimers is ° 0.962 A. Thus, only one CD8ab dimer will be discussed in the following structural analyses. The overall structure of the CD8ab heterodimer is similar to the variable domain fragment (Fv) of an antibody (Figure 1A). The two CD8 subunits highly resemble each other. Both belong to the V set of Ig folds (Figure 1B; Harpaz and Chothia, 1994), despite the fact that their primary sequences are only distantly related with sequence identity less than 20% (19/122 for CD8a or 19/115 for CD8b) (Figure 2). This structural similarity is due to the fact that the residues forming the core Ig-like domains are well conserved between CD8a and CD8b, comprising the same or highly homologous amino acids (shaded red in Figure 2). A C-CW triad, consisting of a disulfide bond between the B and F strands and a neighboring tryptophan on C strand, commonly found in many Ig domains, is one of the conserved elements (Chothia et al., 1998). Both CD8 molecules are also characterized by a cis-proline at the transition point between the A strand and A0 strand and by b-bulges at the C0 and the G strands. Moreover, the segment from the C strand to E strand, which is the most variable region among Ig domains, has few deletions or insertions between mCD8a and mCD8b (Figure 2). These elements

together ensure that the structures of two CD8 subunits have a similar overall architecture. The superimposition of CD8a and CD8b subunits of the CD8ab heterodimer (Figure 1B) results in a root-mean-square-deviation ° (rmsd) value of only 0.97 A for 79 Ca atoms from each ° subunit (1.5 A is the cutoff value). The other conserved residues between the two CD8 subunits are mostly hydrophobic and located in the C, C0 , F, and G strands (shaded blue in Figure 2). They also contribute to the similarity between the CD8ab heterodimer and the CD8aa homodimer, in which the two CD8 subunits contact each other in a hand-shaking mode with C, C0 , F, and G strands from each subunit forming the dimeric interface. Across each dimerization interface, there are nine aromatic rings and two pyrrole rings involved, similar to what has been described for the interface between VH and VL domains of antibodies (Chothia et al., 1985). The interface shape complementarities (Sc values) (Lawrence and Colman, 1993) between CD8a and CD8b in CD8ab and that between the two CD8a subunits in CD8aa are very similar to each other, 0.70 and 0.68, respectively. However, the buried surface areas resulting from their dimerization are ° ° slightly different, 1914 A2 in CD8ab and 2291 A2 in CD8aa. The smaller buried surface of CD8ab seems to be partly due to the opening up of the CC0 -loops at the bottom of the CD8ab interface. There are three glycosylation sites in the CD8ab heterodimer, two in CD8a (on the CC0 -loop and C00 D-loop) and one in CD8b (on the AB-loop). None of these glycans are located in the vicinity of the MHC binding surface (Figure 1A).

unit were disordered with no observable electron density, suggesting that the long CD8a N-terminal region is flexible in its unligated native form (Figure 1). In the CD8aa/Kb complex structure, the N-terminal residues of the CD8a1 subunit, notably Lys1 and Gln3, form hydrogen bonds with the Kb-associated b2M, thus stabilizing the otherwise flexible N terminus and implying an important role in CD8aa binding and function (Kern et al., 1998). The long N terminus is a unique feature of mouse CD8a (Figure 2), which may contribute to some of the differences in CD8 binding between mouse and other species. Additionally, in the CD8aa/Kb complex, Arg8 on the A strand and Glu27 on the B strand of the

CD8a1 subunit also form hydrogen bonds with b2M. Since CD8b has neither the long N terminus nor the Arg8 equivalent, potentially different interactions between CD8b and b2M could affect the CD8ab binding mode relative to that of CD8aa. The comparison of CD8a and CD8b also reveals some differences in loop regions, especially complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs), which are involved in ligand binding and expected to be structurally more variable (Figure 1B). The CDR1s (BC loops) of the two CD8 subunits differ not only in their amino acid composition but also in length (CD8b is one amino acid longer than CD8a). As a result, the CDR1 (BC loop) of CD8b tilts

away from CDR2 (C0 C00 loop) and CDR3 (FG loop) (Figure 3). In addition, the CDR2 (C0 C00 loop) of the mouse CD8b subunit has one deletion in comparison to mouse CD8a; as a consequence, the CDR2 loop of CD8b is directed more toward the CDR3 loop, implying that the CDR2 loop of CD8b may have greater involvement in MHC binding than that of CD8a. Third, the non-CDR CC0 loop of CD8b points away from the dimerization interface, causing a reduction in the buried surface area in the heterodimer surface contacts. Fourth, the C00 D loops are the most different in comparison of the two CD8 subunits, although we anticipate no significant role for that loop in CD8 recognition function as it faces away from the putative MHCI contact surface of CD8ab. On the other hand, for both CD8a and CD8b, the CDR3 is unique to other V type Ig-like domain. The CDR3 region in the variable domain of an antibody or TCR usually has a long, variable, and irregular loop, the FG loop, required for binding to antigens of diverse shape and character (Wang and Reinherz, 2002; Wilson and Stanfield, 1994). By contrast, the corresponding region of CD8 actually assumes a sharp b-turn instead. For CD8b, in particular, this region is characterized by several residues conserved among different species, including one proline at the tip of the b-turn (Figure 2). A proline is commonly found at a sharp b-turn in other structures (Richardson, 1981). CD8 does not bind antigen and apparently has evolved to have a simple and rigid FG-turn for MHCI binding. In the CD8aa/MHC class I complex (Gao et al., 1997; Kern et al., 1998), the two FG-turns of CD8aa homodimer define the center of the CDR region binding surface as they clamp the CD-loop of the MHCI a3 domain, thereby contributing key CD8aa binding residues. The similar conformation of the FG-turns of CD8a and CD8b imply that CD8ab may bind MHCI in a manner similar to that of CD8aa. In the CD8ab structure, the electron densities confirm the formation of the canonical disulfide bond between B and F strands in the CD8a Ig domain, which was also observed in the CD8a subunits of CD8aa/Kb structure. The CD8a buried cysteine (Cys36) on the C strand is unpaired. It is noticeable that in CD8b, this cysteine is replaced by an isoleucine (Ile31), and the substitution has no significant impact on the CD8b Ig core structure. Collectively, these data suggest that a noncanonical intramolecular disulfide bond between this cysteine on the C strand and any other cysteine (Classon et al., 1992; Kirszbaum et al., 1989) is unlikely. Another noticeable substitution, namely replacement of CD8a Phe40 by CD8b Arg35 in the Ig-core region, is structurally com-

patible since the aliphatic portion of the long side chain is buried while the charged guanidine group of the arginine is solvent exposed. Structural Comparison between CD8ab and CD8aa As discussed above, the structures of CD8a and CD8b reveal very similar architectures with limited variation in their loop regions. However, the binding partners for CD8aa and CD8ab are not identical: CD8ab, like CD8aa, binds to classical MHCIa molecules, but CD8aa also binds to the nonclassical MHCIb, TL molecule quite efficiently (Garcia et al., 1996; Kern et al., 1999; Weber et al., 2002). In order to understand the structural basis for their functional differences, a structure superimposition of the two CD8 dimers was performed by overlaying the CD8a2 of CD8aa onto the CD8a subunit of CD8ab (Figure 3). In general, the two CD8a subunits, including all three CDRs (BC loop, C0 C00 loop, and FG loop), align well, with the major variation being in the CC0 and C00 D loops, both located at the bottom of the Ig domain. However, on the left side of the two dimers depicted in Figure 3, the CD8b subunit of the CD8ab heterodimer tilts about 8º relative to the CD8a1 subunit of CD8aa so that these two CD8 subunits are not in a good alignment with one another except for the dimeric interface regions and CDR3 (FG loop). The conserved conformation of the two CDR3 loops at the center of the CD8/MHCI interaction for both CD8aa and CD8ab suggest that the dimers bind MHCI similarly. On the other hand, from our structural data, we anticipate that different elements, such as CDR1 and CDR2 as well as the specific amino acids in CDR3, may confer unique CD8ab/MHCI binding specificities. Figure 4 shows that the electrostatic potential of the CDR regions of the CD8aa and CD8ab dimers are similarly positive. This is also in agreement with a general CD8 dimer/MHCI interaction model, in which the positively charged CDRs of CD8 clamp the negatively charged CD-loop of the a3 domain of Kb, as has already been observed in the CD8aa/MHCI complex structure (Kern et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the observed variations of the surfaces of the CD8aa and CD8ab dimers will lead to subtle but important binding differences. Though the dimerization interfaces of CD8aa and CD8ab are similar, certain differences are worth noting, especially those associated with the residues of CD8a and CD8b on their C and C0 strands (Figure 2). For example, the substitutions of Ser37 and Tyr55 of CD8a by Tyr32 and Ser50 of CD8b, respectively, are complementary. In addition, the CD8b residues Lys43 and Phe45, in lieu of CD8a Pro48 and Pro50, respectively, may

However, that of mCD8aa is rotated roughly 90º about the y axis to put the MHC binding surface facing the reader. The residues Glu222 and Gln226 of the CD-loop of the Kb a3 domain and His60 and Asn107 of the CD8a1 subunit of CD8aa are marked on their corresponding surface for the relative positions of CDRs.

contribute to the reduction of the CD8ab interface relative to the CD8aa interface. Functional Differences between the CDR1 Loops of CD8a and CD8b To assess the functional contribution of individual CDR loop residues of CD8ab and CD8aa on antigen-specific T cell activation, we established a CD8 transfection system by using a T hybridoma recipient expressing the N15 TCR that recognizes the VSV8 octapeptide in the context of H-2Kb in a coreceptor-dependent manner. As shown schematically in Figure 5A, the wild-type CD8a, CD8b, or their variants were stably transfected and expressed on the surface of N15 TCR-bearing T cells. The surface expression levels of wild-type CD8a, CD8b, or their variants on transfectants were matched to within 2-fold difference before the functional assay. One representative set of FACS analyses is shown in Figure S1 (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online). These cells were stimulated with antigen-presenting cells (APC) loaded with varying molar concentrations of VSV8, and IL-2 production was monitored as a measure of coreceptor activity. Because

CD8a plus CD8b double transfectants express a mixture of CD8aa and CD8ab molecules on the cell surface, functional data with wild-type CD8 heterodimers lead to difficulties in interpretation. However, we previously identified a CD8a variant, CD8aR8A, which nearly abolishes CD8aa coreceptor activity, whereas coreceptor activity of CD8aR8Ab is similar to that of wild-type CD8ab (Wong et al., 2003). Therefore, the CD8aR8A variant was used to investigate the contribution of individual CD8b residues in CD8ab function. To examine CD8b CDR1 residues, cell lines expressing CD8aR8A and one of three individual CD8b alanine mutants (Ile25Ala, Leu28Ala, or Thr29Ala) were studied. Figure 5B shows that all three cell lines exhibit comparable (wone log peptide concentration reduction or less) in their coreceptor activity to that of CD8aR8Abwt. Although not shown, flow cytometric analyses of these clones demonstrated the comparable levels of the surface protein expression. Additional alanine mutations at bSer24, bSer26, or bLys27 were all without functional effect (data not shown). The above results are consistent with the structural observation that the CDR1 loop of CD8b points away from the center of the other CDR

loops, unlike the CD8a CDR1 loops in the CD8a homodimer, both of which interact with the pMHCI ligand (Gao et al., 1997; Kern et al., 1998). CDR2 and CDR3 Loops of CD8b Are Crucial for CD8ab Coreceptor Activity We next evaluated single alanine substitutions in the CDR2 and CDR3 loops of CD8b in the same T cell hybridoma system. The Lys55Ala in the CDR2 of CD8b mutation shows a major impact on coreceptor function in Figure 5C. In addition, the CD8b mutations Ser53Ala,

Ser54Ala, and Gly56Ala produce partial loss of coreceptor function, while the Val57Ala mutation, located on the C00 b strand of CD8b, has no effect on coreceptor function. These results are in agreement with the structural prediction that CD8b mutations in CDR2 would have a greater functional impact (Figure 3). Importantly, all side chains of residues in the CD8b CDR3 region (aa 101­103) appear to play critical roles in the CD8ab/ pMHCI interaction. Alanine mutations of CD8b at Ser101 or Pro102 completely abrogated coreceptor activities, while the mutation at Lys103 significantly reduced

For clarity, the orientation of the model in the inset has been rotated 25º around the horizontal axis, and only main chain atoms of residues G221 and L230 of Kb are shown. The starting point was the complex of VSV8/Kb and CD8aa (Kern et al., 1999) with superimposition of CD8a2 in the CD8aa homodimer onto CD8a in CD8ab heterodimer.

coreceptor function (in Figure 5D). A GRASP surface representation in Figure 5E depicted that the residues crucial for CD8ab/Kb interaction form two discrete areas at the center of the CD8ab surface. Orientation of CD8ab Binding to H-2Kb In the CD8aa/pMHCI complex, side chains of residues from the N terminus (Lys1-Pro-Gln) and A and B strands (Arg8 and Glu27, respectively) of CD8a1 form several hydrogen bonds with b2M. These same residues in the CD8a2 subunit have no contacts with the MHCI molecule. We reasoned that if CD8a of the CD8ab heterodimer would assume the CD8a2 position of the CD8aa homodimer, then alanine substitutions of those residues would not affect CD8ab coreceptor function. N15 TCRCD8aa transfectants expressing a single or double mutant involving this region of CD8aR8A or CD8aR8A/E27A, respectively, predictably lost most coreceptor activity (Figure 6A). Furthermore, a triple mutant termed CD8am3, in which residues Arg8, Glu27, and Asn107 were mutated to alanine, formed a CD8aa homodimer devoid of functional activity. Note that the side chain of Asn107 of CD8a1 but not CD8a2 makes contacts with Kb in the CD8aa/Kb complex (Kern et al., 1998). However, when CD8am3 is expressed in the form of a CD8am3bwt heterodimer, its coreceptor activity is as efficient as the wild-type CD8ab or the CD8aR8Abwt heterodimer (Figure 6B). These data argue that CD8b in the CD8ab heterodimer assumes a similar position as the CD8a1 subunit in the CD8aa homodimer.

To rule out the possibility that the side chains of other residues on the CDR3 loop of CD8a might replace the functional role of Asn107 through a minor positional shift, we generated several additional CD8a triple mutants, CD8aR8A/E27A/S106A, CD8aR8A/E27A/S108A, and CD8aR8A/E27A/V109A. Each of these triple mutants had comparable coreceptor activity to the wild-type CD8ab when incorporated into the heterodimer (data not shown). Thus, the side chains of CD8a Arg8, Glu27, Ser106, Asn107, Ser108, and Val109 are not required for CD8ab binding to Kb. A potential model of the CD8ab interaction with VSV8/Kb accounting for these functional data is offered in Figure 6C and described further in the discussion below. Discussion Over the last decade, the molecular features of T cell recognition have been established at structural level. The nature of the clonotypic TCR/pMHC interaction has been resolved for both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (Garcia et al., 1999; Reinherz et al., 1999). In addition, the structures of the CD33g and CD33d components of the TCR have been defined (Arnett et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2001, 2004). The details of coreceptors CD4 and the CD8aa homodimer and their interactions with MHC class I and class II molecules, respectively, were also revealed (Gao et al., 1997; Kern et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2001). Until now, however, structural insight into CD8ab and its pMHCI binding has been one missing

component in our understanding of the immunorecognition machinery. A potential clue to the difficulty in obtaining useful CD8ab crystals is the smaller interdomain contact area of the CD8ab Ig-like domains compared to CD8aa ° ° (1914 A2 versus 2290 A2). Consistent with this observation, cleavage of the leucine zipper appended to the Ig-like domains of purified recombinant CD8ab heterodimers, resulting in formation of CD8aa and CD8bb homodimers, implying a weak association of heterodimers (P. Kern, J.O., and H.-C.C., unpublished results). Although crystals were obtained and partially purified in CD8ab preparation, they were not of diffraction quality, most likely as a result of such mixed dimer formation. Covalently attaching of CD8a and CD8b Ig-like domains in a single chain construct undoubtedly contributed to the current success in structural resolution of the CD8ab Ig-like domains. As a biological correlate, developmental stage-dependent modification of CD8b O-linked carbohydrates by St3 Gal-1 sialyltransferase results in sialic acid capping of sites on the CD8b stalk adjacent to its Ig-like domain (Merry et al., 2003; Moody et al., 2001). This developmental change and associated alteration of CD8ab MHCI binding activity during the CD4CD8 double positive to CD8 single positive thymocyte transition may be more easily modulated by the weakened CD8a-b interface interaction noted here. The structure of the CD8ab heterodimer reported herein provides the first atomic view of CD8b subunit, reveals a remarkable similarity between CD8ab and CD8aa structures, and supports the earlier hypothesis that the CD8ab heterodimer binds to MHC class I molecules in a similar manner to that of CD8aa. While CDR1 and CDR2 of CD8b are different in composition and in conformation from those of CD8a in both the homodimer or heterodimer (Figures 2 and 3), these loops are similar in being positively charged and complementary to the negatively charged CD-loop of the a3 domain of the Kb mouse MHCI molecule (Figure 4). Furthermore, the rigid and conformationally similar CDR3 loops (FG-turn) of both CD8a and CD8b (Figure 3) suggest that the center of the ligand binding site may be largely in common and represents an important determinant for MHCI binding. We used site-directed mutagenesis to map those residues of CD8ab that are critical for CD8ab coreceptor function and to explore possible CD8ab binding modes for pMHCI interaction. In addition, given that the CD8aa homodimer binds Kb asymmetrically, certain residues from one CD8a subunit are important for CD8aa function while the same residues from the second CD8a subunit are not. This asymmetry allowed us to knock out CD8aa function while retaining CD8ab function and thus selectively examine CD8ab coreceptor functions: from the crystal structure of the CD8aa/Kb complex, it was observed that the residue Arg8 from CD8a1 is critical to CD8aa function while the Arg8 residue of CD8a2 makes no atomic contacts with Kb (Kern et al., 1998). Since CD8aR8Ab functions normally (Wong et al., 2003), we infer that the CD8b subunit of the CD8aR8Ab should sit in a position corresponding to the CD8a1 subunit during its interaction with Kb. This orientation places CD8b on the ``top,'' consistent with the CD8ab-MHC binding model suggested by Kern et al. (1998). In this model, the CD8a subunit is at the bottom and the interactions

with the CD-loop of the Kb a3 domain are therefore mostly conserved, including the hydrogen bond between Gln226 on the CD-loop of Kb a3 domain and the Ser37 from the CD8a subunit at the bottom. To examine possible CD8b/Kb interactions, we have generated a docking model by overlaying the CD8ab structure onto the CD8aa/Kb complex with the CD8a subunit of CD8ab superimposed on CD8a2 of CD8aa, as shown in Figure 6C. In this model, both CDR2 and CDR3 of CD8b can form interactions with Kb while CDR1 is pointed away from the interaction interface. This model is consistent with our mutagenesis results, indicating that CDR2 and CDR3, but not CDR1, residues of CD8b are critical to CD8ab MHC binding (Figure 5). In comparison to the CDR2 of CD8a, the CDR2 of CD8b tilts toward CDR3, offering the possibility of additional atomic contacts with Kb. Mutational data on the CD8a residue Asn107 also appear to support the CD8b-ontop model. The side chain of Asn107 from CD8a1 forms two hydrogen bonds to the main chain of the a3 domain of Kb in the CD8aa/Kb complex structure. The same residue from CD8a2 makes no direct Kb interaction. The Asn107Ala substitution abolishes CD8aa homodimer activity. However, CD8aN107Ab functions normally, as does the triple mutant CD8aR8A/E27A/N107Ab. In the CD8b-on-top model, the Ser101 of CD8b can potentially form one hydrogen bond to a main chain amide of Kb, partially compensating for the two hydrogen bonds involving the CD8a Asn107 residue. Although our data favor the CD8b-on-top model of CD8ab/Kb interaction, the mutation data do not exclude other possible CD8ab binding modes. Given the similarity in shape and charge of CD8aa and CD8ab dimers, more than one orientation might be possible. In the CD8aa/Kb interaction, CD8a1 N-terminal residues Lys1, Gln3, and Arg8 interact extensively with b2M residues. In contrast, CD8b is six residues shorter at its N terminus relative to CD8a, so in the CD8b-on-top model, there might be fewer possible contacts between CD8b and b2M. It remains to be determined whether there could be any adjustment in conformation of b2M or subtle shift in the CD8ab docking orientation relative to that of CD8aa during CD8ab binding to Kb such that equivalent interactions to b2M might be restored or compensated through additional contacts. There is at least one critical issue with the CD8b-onthe-bottom model. In that orientation, Gln226 from the CD-loop of Kb a3 domain would lose its hydrogen bonding partner, Ser37 of CD8a2. The Ser37 of CD8a is replaced by Tyr32 in CD8b. As a result, the bulky phenol ring of Tyr32 would make a collision in the highly crowded environment, preventing the side chain of Kb Gln226 from inserting into CD8b. Recall that this Tyrto-Ser substitution is conserved across species (Figure 2). If CD8ab does bind Kb with the CD8b subunit in the bottom position, it will require a major adjustment of the interaction mode relative to that observed in the CD8aa/Kb complex. It is noteworthy that we are unable to crystallize scmCD8abL29 with Kb under any experimental conditions tested to date, despite our ability to crystallize individual components alone as well as CD8aa/Kb and CD8aa/TL complexes (Liu et al., 2003). An intriguing explanation may be that more than one potential CD8ab

Crystal Structure of the CD8ab Heterodimer 669

binding mode to MHCI makes identically repeated lattice formation impossible. We cannot exclude alternative possibilities including the potential for the flexible linker between CD8a and CD8b Ig-like domains to impede MHCI binding. The former possibility can be eliminated by crystallization of mutants such as CD8aR8A/E27A/N107Ab that show a defined binding orientation. A number of molecules are known to form homodimers or heterdimers to fine-tune functional activities as well as interaction specificities. For example, Max can form a Max-Max homodimer or Myc-Max and Mad-Max heterodimers, mediating different activities in transcriptional activation, cellular transformation, and apoptosis (Brownlie et al., 1997; Nair and Burley, 2003). IkBa and IkBb interact with NF-kB p65 homodimers and NF-kB p50/p65 heterodimers to mediate distinct transcriptional regulatory function (Jacobs and Harrison, 1998; Malek et al., 2003). In these situations, each homo- or heterodimer defines a separate binding mode at discrete target sites. To our knowledge, if CD8ab has two distinct binding orientations at an essentially identical site on the same ligand, this would be unprecedented. In summary, our study describes the structure of the ° CD8ab headpiece at 2.4 A resolution. In size, shape, and surface electrostatic potential of CDRs, CD8ab resembles CD8aa. Based on mutagenesis studies, a model in which CD8b replaces the CD8a1 subunit in binding to H2-Kb is suggested, but additional possibilities exist. Analysis of T cell development and function of CD8aR8A/E27A/N107Abwt transgenic mice should help address whether this orientation is sufficient to rescue normal T lineage differentiation and T cell activation in CD8a knockout mice. In the future, the expression of recombinant CD8aR8A/E27A/N107Abwt variant protein may facilitate structural studies of the CD8ab/pMHCI complex as well.

Crystallization and Data Collection ScmCD8abL29H crystals were grown at room temperature from a solution containing 25% PEG4000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) with the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. The crystals were then prefrozen for data collection with a cryoprotectant solution of 20% glycerol, 25% PEG4000, and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5). One diffraction data set was obtained at 100ºK at the 19ID beam line of the Structure Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The data set was processed and reduced with HKL2000 suite (Table 1; Otwinowski and Minor, 1997).

Structure Determination The structure of mCD8ab was determined by molecular replacement with the program Phaser within CCP4 suite (Table 1; Storoni et al., 2004). A CD8a protomer from the CD8aa homodimer structure (PDB code: 1BQH) was used as a search probe. The program found positions of four monomers, which formed two CD8aa-like dimers without clashes to each other. After careful examination of electron density maps, two CD8b subunits were unambiguously assigned to two of the four positions based on CD8a/CD8b sequences and their alignment. These two CD8a and two CD8b subunits formed two CD8ab heterodimers.

Model Building and Refinement Model building, especially the CD8b and the loops of CD8a, was manually performed with the programs XtalView (McRee, 1993) and O (Jones et al., 1991). The structure was refined with the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The first three N-terminal residues (Lys1-Pro-Glu) of both CD8a monomers of the CD8ab structures were missing, with no electron densities. The C-terminal CD8a regions were visible up to Lys121 in dimer A and to Val122 in dimer B. A partial C-terminal linker (RKDGSSA), which is connected to the N terminus of CD8b, was recognized and built into the model for the dimer A. Only 2-residue partial linker for dimer B was seen. There were density breaks at the BC-loops of both a and b subunits. A part of the BC-loop (Lys27-Leu-Thr) of the CD8b subunit of dimer B was truncated due to weak densities. The density for Pro102 of CD8b at the FG-turn was not well defined. A cis-proline appeared to be favored and was built into the model. There are in total six potential N-linked glycosylation sites in two CD8ab dimers, two in each CD8a and one in each CD8b. Based on electron densities, three N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) residues were built into the model, attaching to the Asn42 of CD8a of the dimer A, the Asn42 of CD8a, and Asn13 of CD8b of the dimer B, respectively. The final model also includes 44 water molecules.

Experimental Procedures Protein Expression and Purification of scmCD8abL29 The N-terminal Ig-like domain of mCD8a (residues Lys1-Ser124) was fused via a flexible linker of 29 amino acids (AGSADDARKDAARKD DARKDDARKDGSSA) with the N-terminal Ig-like domain of mCD8b chain (residues Leu1-Val115). The cDNA of the scmCD8abL29 was cloned into the pEE14 vector and transfected into CHO-Lec 3.8.2.1 cells to express recombinant protein as previously described for CD8ab-LZ proteins (Kern et al., 1998). A high-expressing clone was selected, expanded, and cultured in FiberCell Hollow Fiber Cartridge (FiberCell Systems). The yield of scmCD8abL29 from 1 l of cell supernatant was w10 mg/l. The protein was purified with anti-CD8a antibody (53-6.72)-affinity chromatography. As proteins expressed in Lec 3.2.8.1 cells have high mannose adducts exclusively in the N-linked glycosylation sites, affinity-purified scmCD8abL29 protein was subjected to Endo-H (Roche) digestion to remove N-linked glycans in an enzyme/substrate ratio of 0.02U Endo-H/1 mg protein at 37ºC overnight in 50 mM NaOAc (pH 5.5) as described previously (Kern et al., 1998). Concanavalin A Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia) were used to deplete any residual nondeglycosylated CD8 protein by rotation at room temp for 2­4 hr. Subsequently, homogenous, deglycosylated CD8 proteins (scmCD8abL29H) were recovered by a final gel-filtration step with a Superdex S-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia). The purified scmCD8abL29H protein in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was concentrated to w20 mg/ml for crystallization. CD8a and CD8b Variant Constructs To generate the double mutation CD8aR8A/E27A variant, mouse CD8aR8A was subjected to mutagenesis with a PCR method as described previously (Wong et al., 2003). An additional single mutation was added to the cDNA of CD8aR8A/E27A to create the following triple mutation CD8a variants: CD8aR8A/E27A/S106A, CD8aR8A/E27A/N107A, CD8aR8A/E27A/S108A, and CD8aR8A/E27A/V109A. The same strategy was used to generate the following CD8b variants: CDR1 loop residues (bK23A, bS24A, bI25A, bS26A, bK27A, bL28A, and bT29A), CDR2 loop residues (CD8bS53A, bS54A, bK55A, bG56A, and bV57A), and CDR3 loop residues (bS101A, bP102A, and bK103A).

N15 Transfectants Expressing CD8 Variants and IL-2 Production To generate the cell line expressing double mutant CD8aR8A/E27A, the mutant CD8a cDNA was transfected alone or with wild-type CD8b into the N15CD82 cell line as described previously (Witte et al., 1999). For the cell lines expressing CD8aR8Abvar heterodimers, the mutant CD8aR8A cDNA was transfected pair-wise with each CD8b variant cDNA from the CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 loops into the N15CD82 cell line. The resulting transfectants were tested for surface expression of TCRb chain, CD8a and CD8b (by anti-CD8b mAb YTS156) before combining and sorting of bulk populations for similar surface expression levels of CD8. The IL-2 production of the CD8-expressing N15 transfectants was quantified with the MTT assay (Wong et al., 2003).
