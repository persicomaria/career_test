SH3 domains are protein binding domains that occur widely among signal transduction proteins. Here, we present the NMR-determined solution structure of the SH3 domain from the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase, Hck. Hck is involved in a number of cell signal transduction pathways, frequently in pathways associated with immune response. SH3 domains bind proteins via a left-handed polyproline type II helix on the target protein. We have assessed the structural impact of binding to a ligand through addition of a peptide corresponding to a proline-rich region of a Hck target, the GTPase activating protein of the Ras pathway. Ligand binding effects small structural changes and stabilizes the SH3 domain structure. Also, we have compared the solution structure of the Hck SH3 domain to the crystal structure of Hck, in which the SH3 domain exhibits an intramolecular binding to an interdomain linker region. These structures are interpreted as the apo- and holo- forms of the Hck SH3 domain.

myeloid and B-lymphoid origin (Quintrell et al., 1987; Ziegler et al., 1987). It has been shown to be involved in myeloid cell growth, differentiation, and function and has been identi®ed as a signaling component of a number of receptor pathways, including FcgRI (Durden et al., 1995) and FcgRII (Ghazizadeh et al., 1994), LIF/IL-6 (Ernst et al., 1994), IL-3 (Anderson & Jorgensen, 1995), and GMCSF (Linnekin et al., 1994). Hck has been implicated as a regulatory element of the Ras pathway (Briggs et al., 1995) through its interaction with the Ras GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) and has also been shown to bind to HIV-1 Nef (Lee et al., 1995), a 27-kDa protein which plays an important role in HIV viral reproduction (Kestler et al., 1991). Hck also serves functions that at least partially overlap with those of other Src-related tyrosine kinases. Mutant mice that are lacking the hck gene produce phagocytosis-impaired macrophages, and homozygous hckÀ/ÀfgrÀ/À mice show strongly impaired immune response to Listeria monocytogenes infection (Lowell et al., 1994), which is normally controlled by macrophages. Mice with the single srcÀ/À mutation exhibit osteopetrosis, while mice with the double hckÀ/ÀsrcÀ/À mutation exhibit extreme osteopetrosis and high infant mortality. In contrast, fgrÀ/ÀsrcÀ/À double mutants are phe# 1998 Academic Press Limited

254 notypically indistinguishable from srcÀ/À mutant mice (Lowell et al., 1996). The interrelationships among these kinases are not well understood, but the observed functional overlaps are indicative of complex and subtle physical interactions. A detailed study of these molecules and their mechanisms of intermolecular interactions may provide insight into the structural basis by which they serve to regulate signal transduction. Currently, nine members of the Src-related tyrosine kinase family have been identi®ed: Src, Blk, Fgr, Fyn, Hck, Lck, Lyn, Yes, and Yrk. These proteins range in mass from 55 to 65 kDa and share a common structural domain organization (Figure 1): a 50 to 80 residue myristoylated N-terminal ``unique'' domain that contains the region of greatest sequence diversity among the family, a 50 to 80 residue Src-Homology 3 (SH3) domain, a 90 to 140 residue SH2 domain, a several-hundred residue kinase domain and a short C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins generally bind to their associated receptors via their SH2 domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine residues. The SH3 domains bind speci®cally to proteins containing a left-handed polyproline type II helix. While SH3 domains have no intrinsic enzymatic activity, they may serve to sequester target proteins near the receptor or cell membrane (Faux & Scott, 1996; Weng et al., 1994), or act in an autoregulatory fashion. Evidence for this latter role includes the observation that SH3 domain mutations to Srcrelated kinases frequently result in constitutively active proteins (Rodrigues & Park, 1994; SupertiFurga et al., 1993) and that HIV-1 Nef, which binds to the Hck SH3 domain, can stimulate kinase activity in vitro (Moare® et al., 1997) and in vivo (Briggs et al., 1997). A structural explanation for these observations can be found in the recently solved crystal structures of Src (Xu et al., 1997) and Hck (Sicheri et al., 1997), where the SH3 domain

interacts intramolecularly with the linker region between the SH2 and the kinase domains and inhibits kinase activity. The SH3 domain structural motif is not restricted to the Src-related kinase family. Rather, SH3 domains are found in many proteins involved in signal transduction and may occur alone or in combination with SH2 domains and other SH3 domains (Cohen et al., 1995; Pawson & Schlessinger, 1993). SH3 domains exhibit both high sequence homology and, among those proteins for which structures have been determined, high structural homology. With these observations in mind, it is of particular interest to understand the structural basis of target speci®city among the various known SH3 domains. Although it is well-established that SH3 domains bind to a proline-rich sequence that can adopt a type II left-handed proline helix, it has only recently been recognized that the SH3-target protein interaction may involve a signi®cant number of residues in the target protein that are not part of the polyproline helix. This information has come from the recently solved structures of Src (Xu et al., 1997), Hck (Sicheri et al., 1997), Nef (Grzesiek et al., 1996), the SH3 domain of Fyn (Morton et al., 1996), and the complex of Nef with a mutant of the Fyn SH3 domain which substitutes an isoleucine for arginine 96 (Lee et al., 1996). Other thermodynamic and structural investigations of the interaction of a peptide ligand with Fyn-SH3 also support the idea that SH3-target protein speci®city involves interactions outside of the proline helix (Renzoni et al., 1996). SH3 domains are generally able to bind a variety of target proteins and the multifunctionality of Hck indicates that it has numerous targets in vivo. Although the interaction of the Hck SH3 domain with Nef is strongly related to the aforementioned isoleucine residue, the structural factors involved in the speci®city of SH3 domains for their various cellular targets have not been determined. To provide a platform for understanding this speci®city, we describe the solution structure of the Hck SH3 domain and the elucidation of its ligand binding surface in solution, and we compare the apo structure with the SH3 domain component of the recently solved crystal structure of Hck.

Results
We have characterized the Hck SH3 domain, comprising residues 72 to 143 of human p60hck (see Materials and Methods), as monomeric under NMR solution conditions of approximately 1 mM protein, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, and pH 6.2 at 25 C using both 15N relaxation (Fushman et al., 1994) and translational diffusion (Altieri et al., 1995) measurements. Nearly complete 1 H, 13C, and 15N shift assignments have been made and are included as supplementary material. We have determined the solution structure of the Hck SH3 domain using 13C and 15N-edited multidimen-

Structure of the Hck SH3 domain

255 gram Procheck NMR (Laskowski et al., 1993, 1996) indicates that greater than 97 % of the angles are within the most favored and additionally allowed regions. Figure 2A shows the superposition of the 25 low-energy structures of Hck-SH3; these were generated using MD/SA procedures as described in Materials and Methods. A ribbon diagram of a representative structure is shown in Figure 2B. Figure 1 shows the position of the SH3 domain in p60hck, its primary sequence, and the alignment of its secondary structural elements. Hck-SH3 contains two orthogonal b-sheets; each sheet consists of three anti-parallel b-strands with one strand shared between the two sheets. Sheet 1 is composed of strands ba, bb, and be, while sheet 2 is composed of strands bb, bc, and bd. Strand bb, which is shared between the two sheets, exhibits a b-bulge at L108, which is clearly identi®ed by a strong NOE between the amide protons of L108 and E109. This bend is a feature common to SH3 domains and divides strand bb into two substrands, bb1 and bb2 (nomenclature of Kohda et al., 1994).

sional NMR techniques (Case & Wright, 1993; Clore & Gronenborn, 1993). Two sets of 25 conformers each were calculated using a restrained molecular dynamics/simulated annealing protocol implemented in the program X-PLOR v3.851 È (Brunger, 1987). Conformer set 1 was calculated using 1072 NOE-derived distance restraints, 38 hydrogen bond restraints for 19 hydrogen bonds, 29 w1 dihedral angle restraints, and 35 f angle restraints. Set 2 was calculated using 155 1H chemical shifts, 59 13Ca chemical shifts, and 56 13Cb chemical shifts as additional restraints (Kuszewski et al., 1995a,b). No medium or long-range interproton NOEs were observed for the N or C terminus (residues 72 to 77 and 139 to 143) of the SH3 construct used in this study. The absence of NOEs implies that these regions are largely unstructured under the conditions used for this study. Heteronuclear 1 H-15N NOE data also indicate that these residues are extremely disordered. Consequently, these residues were not included in the structure calculations.

The loop that connects strands ba and bb (frequently labeled the RT loop) has been observed to form an anti-parallel b-sheet in the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 as well as in the SH3 domains of PLCg, Src, and human PI3 K (Kohda et al., 1994). In most other SH3 domain structures, this loop has been observed to form either an irregular b-sheet or to not form a recognizable b-sheet. We have not found stable b-strand elements in this region of the Hck-SH3 structures that we have determined. The residues at the base of the loop (L86 to Y89 and S98 to K101) have long-lived (530 minutes) amide protons, but, with the exception of a hydrogen bond between the amide proton of Y89 and the carbonyl oxygen of F99, there does not appear to be standard b-sheet interstrand hydrogen bonding. Further evidence that this loop does not adopt a stable secondary structure can be found in the relative dearth of NOEs (Figure 3A) and the lack of 13 a C and 13Cb chemical shift deviations from random coil values indicative of b-strand conformation. The lack of conformational constraints for this region results in a high backbone RMSD for the RT loop (Figure 3B and C). Conformational

¯exibility of the central turn of the RT loop (E90 to L97) is also indicated from our ®ndings that: 1) the backbone HN-N correlations are not observed for residues 92 to 94, and (2) the HN ± N correlation for residue E95 is extremely weak, presumably because of exchange broadening. However, 13Ca and 13Cb chemical shifts for residue H94 deviate

markedly from random coil values, implying that although there may be ¯exibility along the RT loop backbone, rotations around H94 N ± Ca and Ca ±CH bonds are restricted. Under the conditions used for this study, the Hck SH3 domain contains 33 long-lived amide protons and adopts a conformation that is stable for several months. As such, the Hck SH3 domain is similar to the Grb2 N-terminal SH3 domain, which also has numerous long-lived amide protons (Wittekind et al., 1997), but different from the PLCg SH3 domain, which has no long-lived amide protons (Kohda et al., 1993). Shorter constructs of the Hck SH3 domain, however, appear to be signi®cantly less stable (A. Bax, personal communication) and may exist in a mixture of folded and unfolded states, indicating that some of the differences observed in SH3 domain stability may be related to the speci®c constructs and conditions used. The Ras GAP has been shown to bind to the SH3 domain of Hck. The proline-rich sequence of GAP that is primarily responsible for this interaction has been localized to residues 129 to 144 (Briggs et al., 1995), and we have used a peptide which corresponds to this sequence (see Materials and Methods) to identify the SH3-ligand binding site. It has been well established that monitoring the change in chemical shifts (Ád) of protein resonances upon ligand binding is a sensitive method for de®ning the protein's interaction surface and quantifying the strength of the interaction (Chen È et al., 1993; Gorlach et al., 1992; Otting et al., 1990) when the conditions of fast exchange (as indicated by no line broadening throughout the titration) are met. Titration of the Hck SH3 domain with the GAP peptide revealed the SH3 domain interaction surface and allowed us to determine the dissociation constant (KD) for this interaction through analysis of the chemical shift changes of the backbone HN, N, and CN resonances. Figure 4 illustrates typical titration data from Hck SH3 domain residues either involved or not involved with GAP peptide binding. Non-linear regression analysis of Ád as a function of peptide concentration (Lian & Roberts, 1993) for those resonances which exhibited signi®cant chemical shift change and were in fast exchange yielded KD values of approximately 10 to 50 mM. Figure 5 shows a plot of the changes in chemical shift, as monitored by the HNCO experiment (see Materials and Methods), for backbone HN, N, and CH resonances of the Hck SH3 domain upon addition of GAP peptide. The residues that exhibit the greatest shift changes are those at the base of the RT loop (85 to 90), in the n-Src loop (110 to 115) and in the 310 helix (130 to 132). This yields the same polyproline ligand binding surface observed in the Hck and Src crystal structures as well as that observed in other peptide/SH3 domain complexes (see, for example, Feng et al., 1994; Musacchio et al., 1994; Wu et al., 1995). Substantial shift changes are also noted at E96 and L97. These are, presumably, not caused by direct

interaction with the GAP peptide, since these residues are distant from the ligand binding site, but instead occur as a result of minor conformational changes, most likely in the RT loop, induced by the binding of the peptide to the ligand binding site. SH3 ligands have been shown to bind in two possible orientations (Saraste & Musacchio, 1994). Several groups have proposed methods by which one can predict peptide binding orientation based on the sequence of the peptide (Feng et al., 1995; Lim et al., 1994). These methods rely on the presence of a conserved arginine residue outside of the PXXP core motif (class I: RXXPXXP; class II: XPXXPXR). In the case of the GAP peptide, however, this arginine is not present. Although we have not been able to fully assign the 1H resonances of the GAP peptide, we were able to detect NOEs between the side-chain amide protons of the peptide residue Q11 and the imidazole and a protons of Hck residue W115, which is in the n-Src loop, thereby establishing this peptide as a class II ligand which binds in the minus orientation. Figure 6 shows, schematically, the approximate

lations for residues 92 to 95 could not be observed in the absence or presence of ligand, the cross-peak correlating HN and N of residue 113 with the CN of residue 112 broadened severely upon addition of ligand, and residue 129 is a proline. Addition of ligand also results in markedly longer exchange lifetimes for the Hck-SH3 backbone amide protons, as shown in Figure 7. Similar results were reported by Engen et al. (1997) for the interaction of the Hck SH3 domain with a Nef-derived proline-rich peptide and by Feng et al. (1995) for the interaction of the Src SH3 domain with several proline-rich ligands.

The use of 1H, 13Ca and 13Cb chemical shifts as structural restraints has been shown to be of utility in better de®ning structural features of proteins where NOE or dihedral angle restraints are lacking (Kuszewski et al., 1995a, b). As applied to the Grb2 N-terminal SH3 domain complexed to a ten-residue peptide, use of chemical shift re®nement resulted in a signi®cant reduction in the backbone RMSD of the RT loop (Wittekind et al., 1997). Application of 1H, 13Ca, and 13Cb chemical shift re®nement to Hck-SH3, however, did not result in a reduced backbone RMSD in the RT loop (Figure 3C). There are several, non-exclusive, explanations for this result. First, it is likely that the RT loop is

Structure of the Hck SH3 domain

259 dine 13Ca and 13Cb chemical shifts are affected by the protonation state of the side-chain imidazole ring: random coil histidine 13Ca shifts range from È 55.1 to 56.5 ppm (Richarz & Wuthrich, 1978; Wishart & Sykes, 1994b), depending on the pH of the solution in which the shift is measured. Consequently, histidine residues were not parameterized in the chemical shift re®nement protocol (Kuszewski et al., 1995b; Spera & Bax, 1991). The backbone dihedral angles of residues H93 and H94, therefore, were not subject to any constraints as a result of the 13C chemical shift re®nement protocol. It is notable, however, that even in the uncomplexed form of the Hck SH3 domain, H94 13 a C exhibits a large down®eld shift deviation from the random coil value, resonating at 59.0 ppm. Interestingly, the 13Ca resonance of Grb2 N-SH3 residue D14, which is in a position in the RT loop that is equivalent to Hck SH3 residue H94, is found 3.2 ppm down®eld of the aspartate random coil chemical shift. It is, therefore, likely that these two residues adopt similar, constrained, backbone dihedral angles, even if many of the other residues in the RT loop of the Hck SH3 domain are conformationally ¯exible. Our ®ndings regarding the utility of 1H shift re®nement as currently incorporated into XPLOR are similar to those of Wittekind et al. (1997) in their study of the Grb2 N-terminal SH3 domain complexed to a peptide derived from SOS. In certain cases, such as the Hb2 and Hb3 protons of Y89, the calculated shifts (1.99 and 1.00 ppm) agree well with the experimentally measured shifts (2.31 and 0.75 ppm, respectively). Here, the shifts are determined primarily by the position of the ring of F99, and inclusion of 1H chemical shifts helps to position these residues relative to one another. The extreme up®eld shift of the Y89 Hb3 resonance indicates a w2 angle of $90 for the side-chain of F99. This is similar to the dihedral angle observed in the analogous residue, F9, in the Grb2 N-SH3/ SOS peptide complex, where similar chemical shifts were reported for the Hb2 and Hb3 resonances (2.05 and 0.69 ppm). In contrast, the Hb2 and Hb3 shifts reported for the analogous residue, Y16, in the SH3 domain of Src (Yu et al., 1993) are not strongly up®eld shifted, resonating at 2.42 ppm, implying a w2 for (Src) F26 of nearly 0 . Wittekind et al. (1997) have postulated that the w2 of this conserved (Y or F) residue may be dependent on the presence of a ligand, since in all complexed SH3 domains (including Src), it is $90 . In the case of the Hck SH3 domain, the w2 of this residue is $90 both in the presence (as seen in the crystal structure) and absence of a ligand. 1H chemical shift analysis is, therefore, useful for re®ning the positions of aromatic rings and of protons near these rings, but it is of considerably less help for regions of proteins which are distant from aromatic residues. As implemented in Xplor 3.851, both 1H and 13 C shift re®nement can cause convergence problems during energy minimization, probably because of the dif®culty in establishing an accurate

more ¯exible in the uncomplexed Hck SH3 structure than in the peptide-complexed Grb2 N-terminal SH3 domain structure, since the RT loop is involved in SH3-ligand interactions. Second, the amino acid sequences of this portion of the RT loop are ATADD (Grb2) and AIHHE (Hck). Histi-

Comparison with the crystal structure Recently, the crystal structure of human p60hck, Ê residues 78 to 526, was solved at 2.6/2.9 A resolution (Sicheri et al., 1997). A comparison of the NMR structure with the SH3 domain extracted from the crystal structure shows a high degree of similarity and an equivalent arrangement of secondary structural elements. The global backbone displacement of the minimized average NMR structure (calculated with chemical shift re®nement) from the crystal structure (SH3 coordinates extracted from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entry 1ad5) is shown in Figure 8. The backbone Ê Ê RMSD is 1.15 A over residues 84 to 134 and 1.03 A after exclusion of the RT (residues 92 to 94) and nSrc (residues 111 to 113) loops. A signi®cant portion of this deviation arises from an approximately Ê 2 A shift in the position of the distal loop towards the core of the protein and a concomitant shift in the position of strand bd away from the core of the protein. A similar effect can be seen in a comparison of the crystal structure of intact Src (Xu et al., 1997) with solution structures of the Src SH3 domain free (Yu et al., 1992) and complexed with a ligand (Feng et al., 1995). Examination of the crystal lattice, for both the Hck and Src crystals, indicates that these shifts are a result of crystal packing, as the distal loop makes contacts with other asymmetric units in the unit cell. Exclusion of residues 92 to 94, 111 to 113 and 120 to 132 results in an Ê RMSD of 0.79 A for the remaining backbone N, Ca H and C atoms. Although the shift in position of

strand bd is large, it occurs perpendicular to the plane of the interstrand hydrogen bonds and does not substantially disrupt either the strand backbone dihedral angles or the hydrogen bond network with strand bc. The shift of strand bd also does not require substantial alteration in side-chain packing within the SH3 core, as the side-chains of residues 125 and 127 are oriented away from the protein core, and residue 126 is a glycine. In contrast to the positional shift of the distal loop and strand bd, the differences in the region of the 310 helix between the Hck crystal structure and the solution structure reported here are not related to crystal packing. This conclusion is based on the absence of similar, corresponding differences between the crystal and solution Src structures. The binding of SH3 domains to their proline-rich ligands is mediated through the ligand's proline side-chain rings and the SH3 domain's aromatic side-chain rings, which form complementary surfaces of ridges and valleys. The principal component of this interaction occurs at the interface of the ligand's PXXP motif with the SH3 domain's 310 helix and n-Src loop, and places restrictions on the orientations of the side-chains of both the ligand and SH3 domain. To explain the differences between the solution and crystal structures, we propose that the crystal structure represents the ligand-bound form of the Hck SH3 domain, since the linker region between the SH2 domain and the kinase domain (residues 245 to 255) adopts a polyproline type II helix and lies in the SH3 ligand binding site in the minus orientation, and the solution structure represents the unliganded form of the SH3 domain. Figure 9 shows a superimposition of the 310 helix (residues I128 to V133) and residue W114 of the n-Src loop from both the minimized

both isoforms are found associated with the cellular membranes, but p60hck is also found in the cytosol. Here, we use the residue numbering scheme of p60hck. Protein expression and purification The gene segment encoding the SH3 domain of human Hck (p60hck residues 72 to 143) was ampli®ed by PCR and inserted into the pET-14b plasmid (Novagen). This plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. 15N-labeled samples were expressed in cells grown on M9 minimal media containing 1 g/l 15NH4Cl and 4 g/l glucose. 13C/15N-labeled samples were expressed in cells grown on M9 minimal media containing 1 g/l 15NH4Cl and 3 g/l [13C]glucose. Cells were grown at 37 C and induced with 0.4 mM IPTG when they reached an absorbance of 0.6 to 0.8 at 600 nm. Cells were harvested four hours after induction and frozen for 12 hours at À70 C. The cells were then defrosted, suspended in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 1.0 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl, sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 g for one hour. Hck-SH3 was puri®ed by FPLC in two steps. Supernatant from the centrifugation was applied to a High-Q column (BioRad) at 4 C and eluted using a 50 to 500 mM NaCl gradient in a 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0. Fractions containing Hck-SH3 were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a 1.5 cm Â 50 cm Sephacryl S-200 column (Pharmacia). The ®nal product was eluted with a 20 mM phosphate elution buffer at pH 7.0. Puri®ed SH3 domain was dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. Protein mass and amino acid content were veri®ed by electrospray mass spectrometry. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving approximately 2 mg lyophilized protein in 240 ml of 20 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl buffer containing either 90% 1 H2O/10% 2H2O or 99.9% 2H2O at pH 6.25. The sample concentration was approximately 1 mM. At higher concentrations, aggregation was observed as re¯ected in diffusion and 15N relaxation measurements. The 16 residue peptide, GFPPLPPPPPQLPTLG, which corresponds to residues 129 to 144 of bovine GTPase activating protein, was assembled on a solid support in an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using 9-¯uoroenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry. Following deprotection and removal from the support, the peptide was puri®ed on a Waters C18 reversed-phase HPLC column using an increasing acetonitrile gradient in an aqueous 0.05 % tri¯uoroacetic acid buffer. Data acquisition and processing NMR spectra were acquired at 11.7 and 14.1 T on Varian Unity-Plus spectrometers using Z-spec triple-resonance probes (Nalorac Corporation) at 25 C. Slow HN exchange was monitored by 1H-15N HSQC. Samples were lyophilized from 1H2O and redissolved in 2H2O at 5 C before being brought to 25 C. The ®rst HSQC was started six minutes after addition of 2H2O to the sample. Acquisition time was four minutes 45 seconds. HSQCs were initiated at 18 time-points spanning 20 hours. Titration of a peptide corresponding to the Hck-binding region of bovine GAP was used to determine the protein residues involved in ligand binding and to extract an approximate KD (Lian & Roberts, 1993). Changes in 15N, 1 N H , and 13CH chemical shift were monitored by 2DHSQC and 3D-HNCO experiments. The titration was stopped when there were no further chemical shift

average NMR structure and the crystal structure, as well as residues 244 to 251 of the linker region found in the crystal structure. Clearly, in order to accommodate the side-chain of P246, the aromatic ring of Y132 must shift substantially from its position in the unliganded conformer. The P249 sidechain, likewise, induces shifts in the positions of P129 and W114. The conformational difference of the 310 helix between the NMR and X-ray structures are supported by the NMR data. Analysis of the aforementioned X-ray structure of Src and the NMR structures of Src-SH3 and Grb2 N-SH3/SOS, Ê shows numerous interproton distances under 4 A b2 g2 d2 between the H , H , and H of the conserved proline and the HN, Hb2 and Hd protons of conserved tyrosine in the 310 helix (Hck residues P129 and Y132). In all cases, the tyrosine Hd2 is in van der Waals contact with the proline Hb2, and there are an average of 4.3 interproton distances under Ê 3 A and 7.3 interproton distances between 3 and Ê 4 A between these two residues. While an absence of NOEs can be caused by several factors other than distance, including motion, our ®nding of no NOEs between P129 and Y132 is strongly indicative that the conformational arrangement present in the intact Hck structure does not exist stably in solution in the unliganded SH3 domain.

Conclusions
The structure of the unliganded Hck SH3 domain has been determined in the solution state by multinuclear NMR methods. Although it is similar to the structure of the SH3 domain of the intact Hck protein (as observed by X-ray crystallography), it differs in ways which are consequences of binding to a polyproline type II helix-containing ligand. In particular, the single turn of the 310 helix that is commonly observed in SH3 domains is stabilized by its interactions with the PXXP motif of the ligand. The unliganded Hck SH3 domain has several regions that exhibit conformational ¯exibility, and these regions match those areas involved in ligand binding. The conformational differences between bound and unbound forms of Hck-SH3 highlight what is probably an important aspect of SH3 domain-target speci®city: ¯exibility of the ligand interaction surface. Such ¯exibility likely plays a role in the ability of SH3 domains to bind speci®cally and with high af®nity to a variety of target proteins.

Materials and Methods
Human Hck (Swiss-Prot entry P08631) exists as two isoforms, the 526-residue p60hck (also labeled as p61hck) and the 505-residue p59hck. These isoforms are produced by the use of alternative translational initiation codons (Lock et al., 1991), and differ by the presence of an additional N-terminal 21 residues on p60hck. Both isoforms are myristoylated, and p59hck is also partially palmitoylated. Cellular localization of the isoforms differs:

changes upon addition of peptide. At the titration endpoint, the peptide concentration was approximately twice that of the Hck-SH3 concentration. Backbone 15N heteronuclear NOE measurements were collected by standard 1H-detected methods incorporating PEP sensitivity enhancement (Skelton et al., 1993) and 1H2O ¯ipback pulses (Grzesiek & Bax, 1993). Recycle time was ®ve seconds. Data were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) and analyzed with CAPP (Garrett et al., 1991), Azara (Wayne Boucher, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge) and Ansig (Kraulis, 1989; Kraulis et al., 1994). Sequential/side-chain/stereospecific assignment Sequential assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of Hck-SH3 were made using a combination of HNCACB (Wittekind & Mueller, 1993), CBCA(CO)NH (Grzesiek & Bax, 1992), H(CCO)NH (Grzesiek et al., 1993), C(CO)NH (Grzesiek et al., 1993), and HCCHTOCSY (Bax et al., 1990; Kay et al., 1993) experiments. The amide resonances of H93 and H94 do not report in the 1H-15N-HSQC. Ca and Cb of I92 were determined from the HNCACB correlations with A91; the remaining atoms of I92 were assigned using the HCCH-TOCSY. H93 and H94 were assigned using the (HB)CB(CGCD)HD (Yamazaki et al., 1993) experiment in conjunction with the HCCH-TOCSY. I128, which is followed by a proline, was assigned using the HCCHTOCSY and identi®ed from NOEs between its side-chain protons and those of P129 Hd. Aromatic resonance assignments were made using the (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE (Yamazaki et al., 1993) experiments. The f angles were obtained from analysis of the HNHA (Vuister & Bax, 1993) experiment. Stereospeci®c Hb assignments and w1 dihedral constraints were obtained as described by Bax et al. (1994) using the HNHB (Archer et al., 1991) and HNCOHB (Grzesiek et al., 1992) experiments. Structure calculation Interproton distance restraints were determined from a 75 ms mixing time 1H/15N 3D NOESY-HSQC (Marion et al., 1989), a 150 ms mixing time 1H/13C 4D HMQCNOESY-HMQC (Clore et al., 1991; Vuister et al., 1993; Zuiderweg et al., 1991) and a 100 ms mixing time 1 H/13C/15N HMQC-NOESY-HSQC (Kay et al., 1990) experiments. NOE volumes were converted into distance constraints using the rÀ1/6 relationship and scaled relaÊ tive to intrastrand daN cross-peaks (2.2 A) or interstrand Ê daa cross-peaks (2.3 A). Upper bounds were set at 1.5 times the target distance; lower bounds were set to Ê 1.8 A. Hydrogen bond constraints were established for regions (1) that were indicated to be b-sheet by f angles and by Ha, Ca, and Cb chemical shift (Wishart & Sykes, 1994a; Wishart et al., 1992), (2) that had long-lived amide protons as determined by 1H-2H exchange experiments, and (3) where the acceptor and donor atoms could be identi®ed based on NOEs between neighboring amide and a protons. Two distance restraints of 1.8 to 2.2 D (amide proton to carbonyl oxygen) and 2.8 to 3.2 D (amide nitrogen to carbonyl oxygen) were applied for each determined hydrogen bond. The original set of 12 hydrogen bonds was supplemented by the identi®cation of seven additional hydrogen bonds observed from preliminary structure calculations.

Structure of the Hck SH3 domain N-labeled Hck SH3 domain were made using the three-dimensional 12C, 14N-®ltered, 13C, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiment (Lee et al., 1994; Zwahlen et al., 1997), with a mixing time of 100 ms. Structures were calculated using X-PLOR v3.851 È (Brunger, 1987) running on an R10000-based multiprocessor SGI Power Challenge. Initial structures were generated by distance geometry embedding and re®ned using MD/SA protocols. A total of 50 structures were embedded and subjected to 3000 steps of restrained molecular dynamics at 1500 K followed by 3000 steps of cooling to 100 K. These structures were re-annealed over 4000 steps of cooling from 1500 to 100 K. The resulting set of 50 structures was used as the starting point in the generation of the two ®nal conformer sets. Each set was subjected to annealing from 600 to 50 K over 4000 steps of restrained molecular dynamics. Set 1 included NOEs, hydrogen bonds, and experimentally determined dihedral angles. Set 2 included 1H and 13C chemical shifts as additional restraints. Following energy minimization, the 25 lowest-energy conformers were extracted and analyzed. Typically, 48 to 50 conformers converged. Because of the signi®cant disorder of the N and C termini residues, the calculations were carried out on a model protein spanning residues 78 to 138, rather than the experimental construct of residues 72 to 143. Aqua (Laskowski et al., 1996), PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al., 1993) and MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) were used to assess the quality of the structures and extract structural parameters. MOLMOL and POV-Ray were used to prepare Figures 2, 6, and 9. The coordinates of the 25 lowest-energy structures and the minimized average structure as generated by method 2 have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with accession codes 4hck and 5hck, respectively. Chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (http:// www.bmrb.wisc.edu).
