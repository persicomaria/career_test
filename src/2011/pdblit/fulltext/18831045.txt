INTRODUCTION Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 is an obligate, anaerobic, hyperthermophilic archaeon with an optimal growth temperature of 371 K in the presence of sulfur.1 Proteins from this organism are frequently selected as targets of structure determination for the purpose of understanding their function(s) from a structural perspective. We cloned the gene of PH1010 from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 and overexpressed its protein product in E. coli to investigate its structure and function. PH1010 is a protein consisting of 138 residues with a molecular mass of 16,056 Da and classified as a DUF54 family protein in the Pfam database (Accession number: PF01877).2 Although the function of DUF54 family proteins remain unclear, they are conserved in many archaea such as Pyrococcus abyssi,3 Sulfolobus solfataricus,4 and Methanococcus jannaschii.5 However, they are not conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes. To elucidate the structure and function of a DUF54 family protein, we determined the three-dimensional ° structure of PH1010 at 1.90 A resolution by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method using selenomethionine derivative protein. Our results revealed that although PH1010 is structurally similar to the ribosomal protein L5,6 its multimerization state and the electrostatic potential of the protein surface are quite different from those of L5 protein. PH1010 may therefore possess an archaea-specific function related to its characteristic structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Structure determination

Protein expression, purification, and crystallization of native and selenomethionine (Se-Met) derivative PH1010 were performed as described.7 The structure of PH1010 was determined by the SAD method using the diffraction data of Se-Met derivative crystal. We found 10 of 14 selenium sites using the program SHELXD.8 Refinement of the selenium sites and phasing were performed using the program SHARP.9 The initial model of the Se-Met derivative of PH1010 was automatically built using the program RESOLVE.10 Molecular models of 143 residues (52% of the total) were automatically built with this calculation. To improve the structure of the Se-Met derivative of PH1010, manual model rebuilding and refinement using the programs XtalView11 and Refmac512 in CCP413 were performed. The initial model of native PH1010 was determined by the program MOLREP14 in

Although the crystals of the native and Se-Met derivative proteins are apparently isomorphous, it was not clear at that time that the structures of the native and Se-Met proteins were completely identical. We used the molecular replacement method to determine the structure of the native protein. The structure was automatically built and refined using the program ARP/wARP.15 After auto model building, several cycles of manual model rebuilding and refinement were performed using the programs XtalView11 and Refmac5.12 Water molecules were picked up from the Fo 2 Fc map on the basis of peak height, distance, and hydrogen-bonding criteria. The geometry of the final structure was evaluated with the programs PROCHECK16 and Rampage.17 The coordinates of PH1010 have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession number 3D7A.

Structural analysis was carried out using a set of computer programs: Dali18 for the search of similar structures from the database, Dalilite19 for the superposition of molecules, PISA20 for the analysis of protein interfaces, surfaces, and assemblies, APBS21 for the calculation of electrostatic potential, ESpript22 for the preparation of alignment figures, and Pymol (http://pymol.sourceforge. net/) for the depiction of structure. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structure determination of PH1010

The crystal structure of PH1010 was determined at ° 1.90 A resolution by the SAD method with good stereochemistry. The final model contained two PH1010 molecules (Chains A and B) and 176 ordered water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Because of the poor electron density, we could not build the structure of the N-terminal methionine residue of Chain A and the 1­4 residues of Chain B. Rfactor and Rfree values of the final model were 24.0% and 28.1%, respectively. In the Ramachandran plot, 98.1% of the residues were included in the favored region and the rest were in the allowed region. The data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics of PH1010 are summarized in Table I.
Overall structure of PH1010

The structure of PH1010 is presented as a ribbon model in Figure 1(A). PH1010 is composed of five a-helices (a1­a5) and eight b-strands (b1­b8) with the following topology: b1-a1-b2-b3-a2-a3-b4-b5-a4-b6-a5b7-b8. The first six b-strands (b1­b6) form a slightly twisted antiparallel b-sheet and face five a-helices on one

side. The last two b-strands form an antiparallel b-sheet in the C-terminus. PH1010 forms a characteristic homodimer structure in the crystal [Fig. 1(B)]. The dimerization interface of PH1010 consists of interactions between loops of b1­a1 and a4­b6 of each subunit. The buried ° surface area of the PH1010 dimer is 1203.4 A2, which is equivalent to 7.8% of the total surface area. Although the buried surface area is relatively small, two subunits are tightly connected by a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The most important residue for the dimerization mechanism is Thr17, which is located at the loop b1­a1 [Fig. 1(C)]. The side-chain oxygen atom of Thr17 of Chain A forms hydrogen bonds with Glu18 and Gln93 of Chain B with distances of 2.61 ° and 2.90 A, respectively. The main-chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms of Thr17 of Chain A form hydrogen bonds with Asp19 and Gln93 of Chain B with distances ° of 3.03 and 2.96 A, respectively. In addition to these hydrogen-bond networks mediated by Thr17, the mainchain oxygen atom of Glu18 of Chain A forms a hydrogen bond with Lys22 of Chain B with a distance of 2.80 ° A. Pro107 and Leu108, which are located at the loop a4­ b6, have a hydrophobic interaction with the corresponding residues of the other subunit to stabilize the dimer structure of PH1010. Dimerization of PH1010 was also confirmed by gel filtration analysis and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (estimated molecular masses are 30 and 33 kDa, respectively). Because PH1010 is a protein from hyperthermophilic archaea P. horikoshii OT3, it possesses high thermostability. As expected, PH1010 is not denatured after the heat treatment at 908C for 30 min.7 In the structure of the PH1010 dimer, we observed the formation of 18 ionpairs on the protein surface. Among them, ion-pair networks between Glu78-Arg74-Glu138 seem to stabilize the C-terminal regions of each protomer. Because ion-pair formations on the protein surface and the stabilization mechanisms of flexible regions are important for the thermostability of proteins,23 the ion-pair formations

observed in the structure of PH1010 would also be indispensable for the high thermostability of this protein.
Comparison with other structures

A database search using the program DALI revealed that the overall structure of PH1010 is similar to that of

some ribosomal proteins such as the 50S ribosomal protein L56 (PDB code: 1IQ4, Z-score 5 6.8, r.m.s.d. 5 3.6, the number of aligned Ca pairs 5 112, sequence identity 5 11%) and the 30S ribosomal protein S6 (PDB code: 1VMB Chain A, Z-score 5 3.9, r.m.s.d. 5 4.7, the number of aligned Ca pairs 5 74, sequence identity 5 11%). Although PH1010 is structurally similar to the ribosomal

protein L5 [Fig. 2(A)] except for the C-terminal region and loops, its multimerization state and the electrostatic potential of the protein surface are quite different. In contrast to the homodimer formation of PH1010, L5 functions as a monomer. In the structure of L5, the molecular surface of the rRNA-binding region, which con-

sists of a slightly twisted antiparallel b sheet region, shows relatively strong electropositive features. In contrast, PH1010 possesses a characteristic electronegative surface in the same region [Fig. 1(D)]. Additionally, residues important to the rRNA-binding mechanisms of the L5 protein are not conserved in PH1010. Therefore,

PH1010 would not possess rRNA-binding ability. PH1010 may interact with electropositive molecules such as archaeal-specific transcriptional factors or histone-like proteins. The structures of other DUF54 family proteins have recently been deposited to the PDB (2NWU: structure of SSO1042 from S. solfataricus, 2PZZ: structure of MJ1564 from M. jannaschii, 2OGK: structure of Af2318 from A. fulgidus, and 2NRQ: structure of SSO0741 from S. solfataricus). The overall structures of these proteins are similar to that of PH1010 [Fig. 2(A)]. All of them form homodimers in the same manner as PH1010, though the electrostatic potentials of the protein surfaces are not conserved. When the amino acid sequences of these proteins were compared, residues involved in the dimerization mechanism were found to be highly conserved [Fig. 2(B)]. These results suggest that dimerization is indispensable to the function of DUF54 family proteins. DUF54 family proteins would thus have an archaeaspecific function related to their characteristic method of dimerization.
