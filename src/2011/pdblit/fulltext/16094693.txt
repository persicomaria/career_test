The experimental values were obtained as described in the Experimental section of the main text, they were used in the structure calculation.[b] The predicted values were calculated using the scripts provided by Dr. D.L. Bryce, the structures of the DNA or the protein-DNA complex, and the rhombic susceptibility tensors of individual DNA bases.[37] The standard deviation of the theoretical values were calculated by the estimations made for all the structures in the ensemble.

Figure S1. Inter base-pair DNA helical parameters, Roll, Twist and Rise over both strands of the left half site of the lac-gal operator as a function of the DNA sequence. The parameters were calculated with CURVES and represent an average over 16 structures.[16]

Figure S2. Experimental D HN dipolar couplings for the symmetric Val17Ala18 headpiece ­ lac gal DNA complex (black) and for the left side of the asymmetric wild type lac headpiece ­ O1 complex (red).[4g] The O1 operator is the natural operator of the lac repressor. Note that the RDCs measured for the recognition helix (residues 17-25) are very small, in agreement with the orientation seen in the structures where this helix forms an angle almost perpendicular to the long DNA axis, while those measured for the hinge helix (residues 53-58) are larger and negative, in agreement with their tilted position with respect to the long DNA axis (Figure 4 ­ Main text).
