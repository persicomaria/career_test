The structure of human MRP8, a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family, by MAD Ê phasing at 1.9 A resolution
The structure of human MRP8 in the calcium-bound form was Ê determined at 1.9 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The structure was initially solved by MAD phasing of an ytterbium-substituted crystal and was re®ned against data obtained from a Ca2+-bound crystal. The dimeric form of MRP8 was stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between mutually wrapped helices. There were two EF-hand motifs per monomer and each EF-hand bound one Ca2+ with a different af®nity [the af®nity of the C-terminal EF-hand (EF-2) for Ca2+ was stronger than that of the N-terminal EF-hand (EF-1)]. Furthermore, replacement with Yb3+ occurred in the Cterminal EF-hand only, suggesting a more ¯exible nature for EF-2 than for EF-1. This, combined with previous observations that the helix in EF-2 (helix III) undergoes a large conformational change upon calcium binding, suggests that the C-terminal EF-hand (EF-2) plays a role as a trigger for Ca2+-induced conformational change.

1. Introduction
In the event of acute or chronic in¯ammation, in®ltrate macrophages express two speci®c proteins, MRP8 and MRP14 (Odink et al., 1987). These proteins were originally isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures as part of a complex using a monoclonal antibody directed against human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and were thus named MIF-related proteins (MRP; Burmeister et al., 1986). Subsequent study showed that these proteins are speci®cally expressed in human cells of myeloid origin and that their expression is regulated during monocyte±macrophage and granulocyte differentiation (Lagasse & Clerc, 1988). They are expressed in speci®c stages in acute in¯ammatory states and also in chronic in¯ammatory states such as rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis (Odink et al., 1987; Zwadlo et al., 1988; Delabie et al., 1990). A computer-assisted survey of these proteins using a protein database revealed that they have Ca2+-binding motifs and belong to the S100 family of proteins (Lagasse & Clerc, 1988). The S100 protein family is the largest subfamily of EFhand proteins (Kligman & Hilt, 1988; Persechini et al., 1989; È Schafer & Heizmann, 1996). Members of this family are all abundant low molecular-weight (10±12 kDa) acidic proteins that are expressed in a cell-speci®c manner. Most of them exist as homodimers or heterodimers under physiological conditions. The purported functions of S100 proteins include cellular growth and differentiation, cell-cycle regulation, cytoskeletal protein and membrane interaction and Ca2+ transport. They are composed of two distinct EF-hand motifs

¯anked by hydrophobic regions at either terminus, which are separated by a central hinge region. Some 17 different proteins have been assigned to the S100 protein family È (Schafer & Heizmann, 1996). It was demonstrated by biochemical analysis that MRP8 and MRP14 could form homodimers and heterodimers (Teigelkamp et al., 1991). Several studies of these proteins showed that most of the phenotypic functions may be exerted by a complex of the two molecules. Accordingly, a variety of complex conformations may elicit different phenotypic functions in vivo. To date, no study of the structure±function relationship by means of three-dimensional protein structural analysis has been performed. Here, we reveal the threedimensional structure of MRP8 by X-ray crystallography in order to examine the structure±function relationship in association with Ca2+. The molecule consists of 93 amino-acid residues and has a molecular weight of 10 835 Da. It exists as a dimer in the crystal. The analysis showed that each MRP8 monomer consists of two helix±loop±helix (EF-hand) motifs and that the two monomers in the asymmetric unit wrap tightly around each other in a helical packing. The N-terminal and C-terminal EF-hands show a clear difference with respect to the replacement of the bound calcium by the lanthanide ion.

2.1. Purification and crystallization

Recombinant human MRP8 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli [strain BL21(DE3)LysS] containing a pET-3a expression vector subcloned with the MRP8 cDNA. The protein was puri®ed by anion-exchange chromatography using DE-52 (Whatman) and by gel-column chromatography using Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia). Crystallization experiments were carried out using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method (McPherson, 1976) by

HKL suite (Otwinowski, 1993) and the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).
2.3. Phase calculation

Data-collection statistics are given in Table 1. Native data Ê were collected at a wavelength of 1.0000 A at room temperature on beamline BL-6B of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. MAD data sets (Hendrickson, 1991) were collected at three different wavelengths (1.38525, 1.38580 and Ê 1.10000 A) from a single Yb-substituted crystal at 100 K on beamline BL-18B. 0.7 MPa Xe crystal data were collected at a Ê wavelength of 1.0000 A at room temperature on beamline BL-6B and 2.0 MPa Xe crystal data were collected at a Ê wavelength of 1.0000 A at room temperature on beamline BL-18B. Intensity data were obtained using a Weissenberg camera (Sakabe et al., 1995) and imaging plates as a detector (Miyahara et al., 1986). The data were processed with the

Two Yb atoms were located from the Bijvoet anomalous difference Patterson map and the isomorphous Patterson map. The program SHARP (de la Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997) was used for the re®nement of heavy-atom parameters and MAD phase calculation. The initial electron-density map was obtained after phase improvement using the program SOLOMON (Abrahams & Leslie, 1996) implemented in SHARP. The phasing statistics are given in Table 2. Although we collected Xe-derivative data for the structure analysis as described in x2.5, the map obtained from Yb MAD was suf®ciently clear and no phase combination was applied.
2.4. Model building and refinement

The atomic model was built using the graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991). Of the 93 residues of each monomer of MRP8, 90 of each were built into the initial electron-density map. Three carboxyl-terminal residues of each monomer were completely disordered and could not be identi®ed in the electron-density map. The model was submitted to rigid-body È re®nement using the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1993) with Ê native data in the resolution range 10.0±3.0 A. SimulatedÈ annealing re®nement (Brunger et al., 1987) using slow-cooling È protocols (Brunger et al., 1990; Ê 8.0±2.0 A), positional re®nement and temperature-factor re®neÊ ment (8.0±1.9 A) were performed using the program X-PLOR. No NCS constraints were applied for the re®nement because of the obvious difference in the conformation of the C-terminal -helical region of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit. ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993) was used to ®nd water molecules in the re®nement cycle. At the ®nal stage of XPLOR re®nement, the low-resolution limit of the diffraction data Ê was increased from 10 to 20 A by applying the bulk-solvent correcÈ tion (Jiang & Brunger, 1994). The ®nal model has an R factor of 19.3% for 90% of the data in Ê the resolution range 20±1.9 A, including 180 residues (1±90 of each monomer), four Ca atoms (two Ca atoms for each monomer) Figure 2 Amino-acid sequence alignment of the S100 proteins.

r.m.s. deviations from standard values of bond lengths and Ê angles are 0.005 A and 0.966 , respectively. The r.m.s. deviaÊ tions on superposition of the two monomers are 0.49 A (Ca Ê (Ca atoms of residues 1± atoms of residues 2±70) and 1.32 A 90). Analysis of the protein geometry was performed using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). All 90 residues were located in the most favoured regions (92.2%) or additional allowed regions (7.8%) of the Ramachandran plot.
2.5. Xenon-binding data

MRP8±xenon complexes were obtained by exposing the native crystals to xenon pressures of 0.7 and 2.0 MPa using a device similar to the one developed by Stowell et al. (1996). Ê Derivative data were collected at a wavelength of 1.00 A at room temperature on beamlines BL-6B and BL-18B (Sakabe et al., 1995). The data were processed using the HKL suite (Otwinowski, 1993) and the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The ®rst two Xe atoms were located in both isomorphous and anomalous difference Patterson maps. The third Xe atom was found during the Xe-atom parameter re®nement and phasing using single isomorphous replacement with the anomalous difference effect of a xenon derivative in SHARP (de la Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997).

(Gln44±Arg47) begins in a somewhat different direction. After passing through the helix, the C-terminal EF-hand (EF-2) begins with helix III (Ala51±Leu58), followed by the calcium-binding loop (Asp59±Asn67; loop 2) and ®nally helix IV (Phe68±Ser86). The packing between helix I and helix IV is stabilized by the interactions of aromatic side chains (Tyr16, Phe68 and Phe71), which make a hydrophobic core as in holo calcyclin (Sastry et al., 1998). As these aromatic residues are conserved in other S100 proteins (Fig. 2), they may contribute as a structure determinant for the overall common fold of the S100 family of proteins. The MRP8 dimer is formed by non-covalent interactions between the large hydrophobic patches of the two monomers that are related by a non-crystallographic twofold symmetry. The two crystallographically independent MRP8 monomers have an almost identical fold, with slight differences in loop 1 and helix IV. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations on Ê superposition of the two monomers are 0.49 A (Ca atoms of Ê (Ca atoms of residues 1±90); the residues 2±70) and 1.32 A Ê Ê r.m.s. deviations are 0.26 A for helix I, 0.42 A for loop 1, Ê for helix II±III, 0.20 A for loop 2 and 0.51 A for helix Ê Ê 0.21 A IV, respectively. The dimer's packing is stabilized by hydrophobic side chains in an antiparallel fashion about helix I±IH and IV±IVH. Both helical packings are highly symmetric owing to the antiparallel arrangement of the helices.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure description 3.2. Calcium binding at EF-hands

A view of the overall structure of the MRP8 dimer is shown in Fig. 1. Each MRP8 monomer in a calcium-bound state consists of two helix±loop±helix (EF-hand) motifs that are joined by a nine-residue linker (Cys42±Gly50) characteristic of the EF-hand protein. The N-terminal EF-hand (EF-1) consists of helix I (Glu4±Ser20), the calcium-binding loop (Leu21±Tyr30; loop 1) and helix II (Arg31±Glu41). Following the helix II, a proline residue (Pro43) leads to a break in the regular helical pattern and the smaller one-turn helix

The C-terminal EF-hand (EF-2) of the S100 family of proteins is usually referred to as canonical; its calcium-binding loop is composed of 12 amino-acid residues. The calcium ligands are mostly carboxylate groups of well conserved acidic residues. On the other hand, the N-terminal EF-hand (EF-1) is usually composed of 14 amino-acid residues. The calcium ligands are mostly main-chain carbonyl O atoms and the residues are relatively divergent. The EF-1 usually has lower È af®nity than EF-2 for Ca2+ (Schafer & Heizmann, 1996).

3.3. Difference of two EF-hands

The Ca2+ coordination by the N-terminal and C-terminal EF-hands of MRP8 are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. In the case of EF-1 of MRP8, 14 residues (Ser20± Asp33) form a (non-canonical) EF-hand calcium-binding loop where four main-chain carbonyl groups, Ser20, Lys23, Asn25 and Ala28, make four ligands to the central Ca2+. In ordinal EF-1, the ®fth ligand is a side-chain O atom of the well conserved glutamic acid (Fig. 2). However, in MRP8, the corresponding residue was replaced by aspartic acid (Asp33), which has a shorter side chain. Because of this change, the O atom of Asp33 is not directly ligated to the Ca2+, but a water molecule bridges the O atom of Asp33 and the Ca2+. There is no sixth ligand for MRP8. This position is usually occupied by a water molecule (Szebenyi & Moffat, 1986; Matsumura et al., 1998). As in C-terminal EF-2, MRP8 contains all the residues needed for calcium binding (Asp59±Glu70). Seven oxygen ligands (the main-chain carbonyl group of Ala65, the monodentate Asp59, Asn61 and Asp63, the bidentate Glu70 and a water molecule) interact with calcium, forming a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. The case of seven oxygen ligands binding calcium ion has been reported in other S100 proteins, namely holo psoriasin, holo calbindin and troponin-C (Herzberg & James, 1985; Szebenyi & Moffat, 1986; Brodersen et al., 1998). The main-chain structures of EF-1 and EF-2 in the two MRP8 monomers are compared with holo calbindin (Szebenyi & Moffat, 1986) and holo S100B (Smith & Shaw, 1998) in Fig. 4. The EF-1 of MRP8 is similar to that of calbindin and S100B except for the N-terminus, but EF-2 is somewhat different. Helix IV of MRP8 is longer than the corresponding helix in calbindin by one turn. It is likely that the interhelix angle of helix I±II is similar (Table 3), but it is more divergent in helix III±IV. Moreover, helix IV of the two MRP8 monomers is somewhat different at the C-terminus (r.m.s. deviation Ê is 0.51 A). Thus, the C-terminal helix (helix IV) is more variable in shape. It has been proposed that helix IV may be important in cases where many similar calcium-binding proteins distinguish their cognate target molecules from other proteins (Hilt & Kligman, 1991).
Acta Cryst. (2000). D56, 559±566

In the Ca2+-bound crystal of MRP8, the electron density corresponding to the Ca2+ ion in EF-2 was higher than that in EF-1. This difference was con®rmed by the temperature factors of these atoms after structure re®nement. The B Ê factors of Ca2+ in EF-1 are 33.06 and 35.63 A2 for the two Ê independent monomers, while they are 11.29 and 13.41 A2 in EF-2. (The occupancies of both sites were kept at unity throughout the re®nements.) This is consistent with the previous observation that EF-2 has a higher af®nity than EF-1 for Ca2+ (Kligman & Hilt, 1988; Rammes et al., 1997). In this context, it may be of interest to note the molecular behaviour observed during the course of preparing a heavy-atom derivative. For structure analysis by the MAD method, we attempted to replace the calcium ion with a ytterbium ion prior to crystallization. In the ytterbium-substituted crystal, the calcium ion in EF-2 was replaced by a ytterbium ion, whereas the calcium ion in EF-1 remained bound as judged from the initial electron-density map and the anomalous difference Fourier map of the ytterbium-substituted crystal; the latter map showed no peak at the ion-binding site. This view was con®rmed by the temperature factors of the atoms Ê assigned as calcium (33.2 and 34.8 A2 for the two independent monomers) after the structure re®nement. Thus, while EF-2 has a higher af®nity for calcium ions than EF-1, it can also more easily release the calcium ions upon environmental change. These are clearly favourable characteristics for the calcium switch. This feature can be rationally explained by the difference in calcium ligands between the two sites; the calcium ligand of EF-2 is mostly side chains, compared with the main-chain carbonyl O atom in EF-1. EF-2 may not need to pass though an energetically unfavourable transition state during the course of ion exchange. A relevant observation was the case of holmium-bound psoriasin, where the calcium ion in the C-terminal EF-hand was substituted by a holmium ion and the N-terminal EFhand has no bound atom. However, in this case the Nterminal EF-hand has three residues deleted (Fig. 2) and may have no calcium-binding capacity (Brodersen et al., 1998). In the case of the half-saturated cadmium state of calbindin, EF-2 was occupied by a cadmium ion but EF-1 was unoccupied (Akke et al., 1995). In the latter case, the structure exhibited a large difference before and after cadmium binding. This structure is more similar to that of the fully calciumsaturated state. The calcium-triggered conformational change is the ®rst step in the binding of the S100 family of proteins to their cognate target molecules. It has previously been shown that S100B, one of the S100 family of proteins, undergoes a large conformational change upon calcium binding (Smith & Shaw, 1998; Matsumura et al., 1998). The backbone reorientation of the N-terminus of EF-2 leads to a change in the position of helix III relative to other helices close to the molecular centre (helices I and IV), resulting in the exposure of the hydrophobic residues at helix IV. Based on these observations, it was proposed that the S100 molecule binds target molecules by the

exposed hydrophobic residues in a similar way to calmodulin (Matsumura et al., 1998). The xenon-binding site we found provides further support for this idea. During the course of the heavy-atom search, we prepared a MRP8±xenon complex by diffusion of xenon gas into the MRP8 crystal at high pressure (0.7 and 2 MPa) using a device similar to that developed by Stowell et al. (1996). The Ê difference Fourier map at 2.0 A revealed that three Xe atoms

hand can bind Ca2+ only at higher concentrations (Kligman & Hilt, 1988; Rammes et al., 1997). However, an unexpected result was obtained when calcium was replaced with ytterbium. The structure of the Yb3+-substituted form of MRP8 showed that only the calcium ion in the EF-2 site was actually replaced by Yb3+. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Xe atoms can be accommodated in the hydrophobic cavity created between two -helices. It is thus conceivable that the structural change of S100 protein induced by Ca2+ observed in previous experiments (Zwadlo et al., 1988; Matsumura et al., 1998) may be triggered by the binding of Ca2+ to the C-terminal EF-hand Figure 5 (EF-2) site. Stereo drawing of MRP8 dimer showing trapped Xe atoms in a hydrophobic cavity The present results are also consistent with the created at the monomer interface. Xe atoms are shown as green spheres. The main chains of the two independent monomers are shown in different colours (blue and red), ®nding that MRP8 and MRP14 exert biological with their hydrophobic parts in yellow.

Conclusions MRP8 and MRP14 are members of the S100 family, the largest subfamily of EF-hand proteins that are involved in calciumdependent enzyme activation, regulation of cellular differentiation and cell-cycle progression (Kligman & Hilt, 1988; È Persechini et al., 1989; Schafer & Heizmann, 1996). Although no de®nite function could be assigned to these two proteins, their expressions are largely con®ned to myeloid cell lineage: granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages (Odink et al., 1987; Lagasse & Clerc, 1988). Recently, it was reported that MRP8 and MRP14 possess the potential to bind arachidonic acid depending on the intracellular Ca2+ level, showing that elevation of Ca2+ might stimulate the translocation of these from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane as well as to intermediate ®laments (Klempt et al., 1997). In this context, a molecular-basis study on the biological activities of these proteins with Ca2+ appears to be important. In this study, we have demonstrated the three-dimensional structure of MRP8 in complexes formed with Ca2+ and Yb3+. The structure of the Ca2+-bound form showed that EF-2 binds Ca2+ more tightly than EF-1. This is consistent with previous reports that the C-terminal EF-hands of other S100 family proteins exhibit a signi®cantly higher af®nity for Ca2+ than do the N-terminal EF-hand domains, and that the N-terminal EFActa Cryst.
