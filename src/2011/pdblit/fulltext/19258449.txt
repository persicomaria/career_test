We have solved the structures of mammalian mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) and conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF). CDNF protects and repairs midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo; MANF supports their survival in culture and is also cytoprotective against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Neither protein structure resembles any known growth factor but the N-terminal domain is a saposin-like lipid-binding domain. MANF and CDNF may thus bind lipids or membranes. Consistent with this, there are two patches of conserved lysines and arginines. The natively unfolded MANF C-terminus contains a CKGC disulphide bridge, such as reductases and disulphide isomerases, consistent with a role in ER stress response. The structure thus explains why MANF and CDNF are bifunctional; neurotrophic activity may reside in the N-terminal domain and ER stress response in the C-terminal domain. Finally, we identified three changes, MANFI10!KCDNF, MANF E79!MCDNF and MANFK88!LCDNF, that may account for the biological differences between the proteins. Keywords: ER stress/MANF and CDNF/natively unfolded protein/neurotrophic factor/saposin

Introduction The novel 18 kDa mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), also known as ARMET (Shridhar et al., 1996), has no sequence homology to other neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) ´~ (Ibanez, 1998). It enhances the survival of embryonic midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vitro (Petrova et al., 2003) and protects neurons against cerebral ischemia in vivo, possibly by inhibiting cell necrosis/apoptosis in cerebral cortex (Airavaara et al., 2009). We recently showed that the homologous conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) is a trophic factor for dopaminergic neurons in vivo (Lindholm et al., 2007). Like glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, both MANF (Voutilainen et al., unpublished results) and CDNF protect and repair midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo in a rat 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease (Lindholm et al., 2007). They may, therefore, be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative

diseases. Both CDNF and MANF are expressed in different mouse and human tissues, including the brain (Lindholm et al., 2007; Lindholm et al., 2008). Mammals have two structurally related factors MANF and CDNF, whereas invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster have a single protein that has higher sequence similarity to MANF than to CDNF (Palgi et al., 2009). These proteins form the first evolutionarily conserved family of neurotrophic factors--but their neuroprotective mechanism and receptors are still unknown. MANF and CDNF are also involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress causes MANF upregulation both in fibroblasts (Lee et al., 2003) and in pancreatic b cells (Mizobuchi et al., 2007), and the MANF C-terminus contains a KDEL-like sequence, also indicating that it is present in the ER lumen (Mizobuchi et al., 2007). Furthermore, MANF and CDNF secrete via the classical ER-Golgi pathway (Apostolou et al., 2008). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER is the ultimate cause of the UPR and ER stress (Marciniak and Ron, 2006), and Apostolou et al. (2008) proposed that MANF and CDNF might help remove misfolded proteins from the ER by the degradation and/or enhancing protein folding. CDNF expression was, however, not upregulated in cell lines upon ER stress, indicating that CDNF functions in the ER in a constitutive manner (Apostolou et al., 2008). Previous studies thus suggested both a secretion-based neuroprotective role and an ER stress-induced cytoprotective role for MANF and CDNF (Petrova et al., 2003; Lindholm et al., 2007; Mizobuchi et al., 2007; Apostolou et al., 2008). The mechanisms behind these functions are not clear, nor how -- or if -- they are related. We report here the crystal ° structures of full-length MANF at 2.8 A resolution and of a ° proteolytic fragment of CDNF (CDNF-DC), at 1.6 A resolution. The N-terminal domains are clearly saposin-like proteins (SAPLIPs). The C-terminal domain (MANF-C) contains a fourth disulphide bridge that may have reductase or disulphide isomerase activity, explaining the role of MANF in the ER. SAPLIPs are a large, diverse family of small, cysteine-rich proteins that interact with lipids and membranes. The four human saposins (A­ D) are lysosomal glycoproteins that degrade various sphingolipids, presumably by solubilising them from membranes (reviewed in Bruhn, 2005). Other SAPLIPs include the membrane-lytic NK-lysin (Liepinsh et al., 1997) and granulysin (Anderson et al., 2003). Our identification of MANF and CDNF as SAPLIPs adds new functions to this diverse and important protein family.

to produce a His-tagged fusion and a thrombin cleavage site at the N-terminus. The protein was produced by overexpression in Escherichia coli Origami (DE3) cells grown at 378C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG and the cells were harvested after a 4-h culture at 378C by centrifugation. Cells were sonicated in 20 ml water followed by the addition of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.5 M NaCl. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20 000g for 20 min at 48C. After incubating the supernatant in Ni2þ-resin for 1 h at 48C, the resin was washed with PBS in the presence of 10 mM imidazole and the fusion protein eluted with 0.5 M imidazole in PBS, pH 8.0. The fusion tag was removed by incubation with 10 U of thrombin (GE Healthcare) per mg of MANF overnight at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2. Subsequently, the samples were passed over a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0). The flow-through was applied to a Resource S column in 20 mM MES pH 6.0 and MANF was eluted with a linear 0-1 M NaCl gradient in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.0. Mature human CDNF (1 ­ 161) was produced in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described (Lindholm et al., 2007). In addition, a CDNF proteolytic fragment that copurified with full-length CDNF was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column. To prepare the fragment for N-terminal sequencing, we used reverse-phase chromatography on a 1 mmÂ150 mm Vydac C8 column ° (LC-Packing; 8.5 mm, 300 A) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0 ­ 100% in 60 min) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 50 ml/min and monitored at 214 nm. The fractions containing the fragment were then analysed by N-terminal sequencing using a Procise 494A sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division) and by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ­ ionisation time-of-flight) mass spectrometry on an Ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonik), using a 337 nm nitrogen laser and a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or sinapinic acid as the matrix. We were thus able to show that the fragment, which we call CDNF-DC, was an N-terminal truncation containing residues 1 ­ 107 of the full-length protein. We, therefore, cloned a construct encoding these residues, an amino-terminal 6His-tag and a thrombin cleavage site into the pFASTBAC1 (Gibco) based baculovirus transfer vector ¨ pK503.9 (Keinanen et al., 1998). This added a FLAG-tag and an insect cell secretion signal sequence to the N-terminus. Recombinant baculovirus was produced and amplified using Sf9 cells in serum-free SF-900II (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml gentamycin (Sigma) at 278C. For large-scale expression of the protein, Sf9 cells were grown to a density of 1.5­ 2.0 Â 106 cells per ml in serum-free medium in 1 l shaker flasks and infected with recombinant CDNF-DC baculovirus at high multiplicity. At 3 days post infection, the protein was purified from culture supernatants as described above for MANF with the following modifications. First, the washing buffer for Ni-chromatography was 0.5 M KCl, 10 mM imidazole in PBS. Second, the loading buffer for the Resource S column (GE Healthcare) did not contain 150 mM NaCl. Third, we used a third purification step as well: gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column in HEPES buffered ( pH 7.5) 0.3 M NaCl. We used SDS ­ PAGE and stained with Coomassie to check for purity. 234

For selenomethionine (SeMet) labelling in insect cells (Bellizzi et al., 1999), the CDNF-DC expression protocol ¨ was modified according to Leppanen et al. (2004). At 24 h after infection, the insect cells were harvested, washed and transferred to SF900II medium lacking methionine (Invitrogen). Following a 2-h depletion period, the medium was supplemented with 60 mg/ml L-SeMet (Calbiochem). Culture supernatant was harvested after additional 48 h and the protein purified as above.

Crystallisation and structure determination
For crystallisation, the purified proteins were concentrated to 5 ­ 20 mg/ml and the protein buffer was changed to 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 supplemented with 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) P8340 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3. Crystallisation conditions were screened using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion technique in the Helsinki robot crystallisation facility (http://www.biocenter.helsinki.fi/ bi/xray/automation/). Needle crystals of MANF grew within 1 to 2 weeks at 48C over a reservoir solution of 100 mM Na-cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.2 M MgAc2 and 12 ­18% (w/v) PEG 8000. The final drops were prepared manually mixing 1 ­ 2 ml of the reservoir solution and 1 ­ 2 ml of the protein solution. The ° crystals belong to space group P61 (a, b ¼ 96.50 A, c ¼ ° 35.05 A) with one molecule per asymmetric unit and solvent content of 53% (Table I). For heavy-atom derivative data, the crystals were soaked in 1% (v/v) saturated CH3HgAc solution in water with 14% (v/v) glycerol at pH 6.5 for 2 h at 48C. The CDNF-DC fragment crystallised as clusters of plates within several weeks at 48C. Crystals of CDNF-DC at

10 ­ 20 mg/ml were grown in sitting drops (1þ1 ml) over a reservoir solution of 100 mM Na-acetate, pH 4.6, 0.2 M NH4-acetate and 25­ 30% (w/v) MME-PEG 2000. The crys° ° tals belong to space group P21 (a ¼ 48.30A, b ¼ 42.04A, ° and b ¼ 97.678) with two molecules per asymc ¼ 51.99A metric unit and a solvent content of 53%. The selenomethionine-substituted CDNF-DC crystallised under the same conditions with essentially the same crystal parameters (Table II). We harvested crystals for data collection in a reservoir solution with 14% (v/v) glycerol and flashfroze them in liquid nitrogen. ° A complete dataset to 1.6 A resolution was collected from a single CDNF-DC crystal (Table II) using the beam line ID14-EH3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. For phasing, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data on a CDNF-DC ° selenomethionine-derivative were collected to 1.9 A resolution at beamline BM14U (ESRF) at three wavelengths (Table II). Data were integrated and scaled with XDS (Kabsch, 1993) software. Data reduction, free R assignment and all further data manipulation were carried out with the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994). SHELXC/D/E programs implemented in the HKL2MAP (Schneider and Sheldrick, 2002) graphical interface were used to find and refine the expected six selenium sites in the Se-CDNF-DC MAD data, producing a ° phase set with a figure of merit of 0.60 at 1.9 A (Table II). The electron density map was readily interpretable and the phases were input for refinement and automated modelbuilding using ARP/wARP (Morris et al., 2002).

PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) was used to assign secondary structure elements and calculate the Ramachandran plot. Even though the cell dimensions were exactly the same (Table II), the crystals of the SeMet-substituted CDNF-DC were non-isomorphous from those of the proteolytic CDNF-DC. Thus, the ARP/wARP model of the SeMetCDNF-DC was refined first with the selenium inflection point data using REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) in restrained refinement mode. The refinement was monitored using the free R factor. A subset (5%) of the diffraction data was chosen randomly and omitted from refinement for the calculation of the free R factor (Rfree). The REFMAC5 refinement was followed by iterative ARP/wARP (Morris et al., 2002) cycling and manual model building in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). The structure of the SeMet-substituted CDNF-DC (data not shown) was used for the initial rigid-body refinement of the proteolytic CDNF-DC. Model building and refinement were carried out as above with the addition of isotropic B-factor refinement with REFMAC5 to a final R-factor of 20.9% (Rfree 24%) (Table II). PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) analysis shows that there are no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table II). The first eight residues and two residues in the C-terminus (106 ­ 107) could not be built because of lack of density. The 2Fo-Fc map quality was good throughout the structure (Fig. 1A). MANF native, Sulphur-SAD and Hg-derivative data were collected on beam lines ID14-1, ID23-1 and ID14-3 at the ESRF (Table I). Data were processed with XDS (Kabsch, 235

1993) and the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994) as shown above. The initial phases were determined using the anomalous and isomorphous ° differences of the Hg-derivative at 4 A resolution (Table I). Three heavy-atom sites were determined and refined by using the SHELX C/D/E programs in HKL2MAP (Schneider and Sheldrick, 2002). Experimental phases were further improved and extended by solvent flattening and histogram matching with DM (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994). The space group was shown to be P61 by a clear difference in electron density contrast and connectivity between P61 and P65. However, we could only build a partial model from the Hg-phased electron density map and so the final structure was determined by molecular replacement with CDNF-DC as a search model. The Sulphur-SAD data allowed us to locate the disulphide bridges, especially at the C-terminus. This provided key registration information allowing us to build residues 99­ 137 into the exceptionally poor C-terminal density. ° The MANF structure refinement was carried out at 2.8 A resolution with 4.6% of the reflections excluded for calculating the free R factor. Model building and refinement were carried out, except for the ARP/wARP cycling, using the programs as described above. The final model of MANF consists of residues 1 ­ 137 (Table I). Due to the poor quality of the electron density map, the C-terminal area (residues 99­ 137) was difficult to model; key to our ability to do so was the identification of the parallel helices a6 and a7 (Fig. 2B) and the anomalous density for the cysteines visible in the Hg-phased S-SAD amplitude map (Fig. 1B) at 3.5s. This allowed us to model the region from 99 to the end of a7 as polyalanine, except for the disulphide bridge between C127 and C130 (Fig. 1B). This improved both Rwork and Rfree significantly; including this region, the values are 28 and 30.5%; without it, 32.1 and 32.7%. Other fitting possibilities and connectivities were also explored (data not shown) but the one shown here was the best. Results

final model consists of residues 9 ­ 105 in two chains, four phosphate ions and 145 water molecules in the asymmetric ° unit. Using native data at 1.6 A resolution, the model was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.9% and an Rfree of 24% with good geometry (Table II). The full-length MANF structure was solved by molecular replacement using the CDNF-DC structure. The asymmetric unit contains a single MANF chain, residues 1 ­ 137, and was refined at ° 2.8 A resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 28.0% and an Rfree of 30.5% (Table I). The CDNF-DC structure has a typical `closed' globular saposin-like architecture with five a-helices (a1 ­ a5) followed by a turn of 310 helix (Fig. 2A). Helices a1, a2, a4 and a5 have an up-and-down four-helix bundle topology distorted by the insertion of a3. In the closed conformation, helices a1, a2 and a3 form one `leaf' (Bruhn, 2005), which packs the second `leaf' formed by helices a4 and a5. In the `open' conformation discussed below, the two leaves can form a domain-swapped dimer (Ahn et al., 2003). A sevenresidue loop from 60 to 66 (nine in MANF, 55­ 63) connects a3 and a4 and disulphide bridges link a1 and a5, a2 and a3, and a1 and the C-terminal turn of 310 helix. There are two ion pairs: R20-E52, mediated by two waters, and R28-E40 (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of human MANF (MANF-N; residues 1 ­ 95) is essentially the same [root mean square deviation (RMSD) ° 0.89 A for 86 Ca-atoms) (Fig. 2B). As well as the three MANF-N disulphide bridges, MANF-C also has a disulphide bridge (C127 ­ C130; Figs 1B and 2B). Like CDNF-DC, MANF-N has electrostatic interactions on the surface: the R15-E47, D19-R23-E35 and E67-K88 ion pairs (Supplementary data are available at PEDS online, Figure S1). In both proteins, the hydrophobic core in the N-terminal domains is relatively small due to the distorted nature of the helix bundle.

Comparison of CDNF-DC and MANF with other structures
A DALI search (Holm and Sander, 1993) of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) showed that the CDNF-DC and MANF-N are structurally similar to SAPLIPs, as defined in the SCOP database (Murzin et al., 1995). The 80-residue long SAPLIP domain consists of five a-helices stabilised by three disulphide bridges and is usually in a globular, closed conformation. SAPLIPs, which have low sequence identity to each other ( 17%), typically are single-domain proteins. Although they have a wide variety of functions, all seem to interact with membranes or lipids (Bruhn, 2005). CDNF-DC and MANF-N are structurally closest to the membrane-lytic proteins, granulysin (Anderson et al., 2003) (Fig. 2D) and NK-lysin (Liepinsh et al., 1997). CDNF-DC and MANF-N can be superimposed on granulysin with ° ° RMSD of 3.5 A and 3.0 A for 69 and 70 Ca-atoms, respectively, out of a total of 74 Ca-atoms. This is because the bend angle between helices a3 and a4 is similar in all four proteins, even though MANF and CDNF have a nine-residue loop between the helices while NK-lysin and granulysin have just a kink. This bend angle is important in determining the precise tertiary structure of the SAPLIP (Anderson et al., 2003). In addition, the kink distorts the helix-bundle topology, making the hydrophobic core loosely packed. This may help expose the hydrophobic surface, allowing membrane binding and even leading to fracturing of the target membrane (Anderson et al., 2003). However, MANF and CDNF differ from most other SAPLIPs in that they are twodomain proteins, where the N-terminal domain is the SAPLIP and the C-terminal appears to be natively unfolded (Fig. 2B).

Oligomerisation
At neutral pH SAPLIPs are usually monomers. However, saposin B crystallised as a homodimer with the hydrophobic core exposed to bind lipids (Ahn et al., 2003) (Fig. 3A). Saposin B dimerisation seems to be a prerequisite for lipid ligand binding. Granulysin kill bacteria by increasing membrane permeability, and the crystal structure revealed a plausible mode of granulysin clustering allowing cooperative membrane lysis (Anderson et al., 2003). At low pH (4.8) and in the presence of a detergent, saposin A and C assembled in solution into dimers and trimers, respectively (Ahn et al., 2006). Recently, saposin C crystallised at pH 4 as a domain-swapped homodimer in the open conformation, while saposin D crystallised at pH 6 as a dimer of closed conformations (Fig. 3B and C) in the same study (Rossmann et al., 2008). Conformational changes and oligomerisation, especially upon lipid binding and at low pH, are thus common in SAPLIPs. MANF crystallised as a monomer at neutral pH in the closed saposin fold, while CDNF-DC crystallised with a ° dimer (RMSD 0.25 A for all Ca) in the asymmetric unit at pH 4.6 (Fig. 3D). The CDNF-DC structure is also closed, unlike saposin C. The accessible surface area buried in the ° dimer interface is only 550 A2 (POPScomp, Fraternali and Cavallo, 2002), but the interactions extend along the length of a2, including a key four-way ionic network involving R28 and E40 from both monomers. CDNF may thus dimerise at low pH or in the presence of lipid (Ahn et al., 2003, 2006); the C-termini (Fig. 3D) are well separated and so would not 237

The MANF and CDNF C-terminal regions are natively unfolded
Unfolded protein servers, including DisEMBL (Linding et al., 2003), predict that the C-terminal region in CDNF and MANF is partially unstructured. DisEMBL indicated that residues 93­ 105, 124 ­ 132, 143­ 158 of MANF are unstructured (Fig. 2C). The disordered structure of MANF-C is consistent with this; it shows a loop from 95 to 111 followed by two parallel helices (a6 and a7) connected by a loop from residues 123 to 130 (Supplementary data are available at PEDS online, Figure S2). Due to the poor quality of the MANF electron density maps in the C-terminus region, residues 99 ­137 were modelled as polyalanine, except for the disulphide bridge between C127 and C130, which was modelled based on density in a sulphur-anomalous map (Fig. 1B). Residues 138 ­ 158 are not visible at all. The DisEMBL prediction, thus, matches the disorder we observe extremely well. The structure of MANF-C is stabilised by crystal contacts; the conformation we see is presumably one of the many possible. MANF and CDNF contain two CXXC motifs. The first is at the N-terminus, and C9 and C6 (MANF numbering) form disulphide bridges with Cys on helices a5 and 310, respectively. The two Cys in the second CXXC motif (127CKGC130 in MANF-C) form an internal disulphide bridge (Fig. 1B); the same is presumably true for CDNF 132CRAC135.

prevent dimerisation. R28 and E40 are conserved in CDNFs but not in MANFs (Supplementary data are available at PEDS online, Figure S2). Dimerisation might thus be one difference between the two proteins and may partly explain their differing biological function. On the other hand, both MANF and CDNF behave as monomers during gel filtration at pH 7 (data not shown), and the small difference in oligomerisation we observe in the crystal structure may just be due to the difference in the pH of crystallisation.

Structural comparison and evolutionary conservation
The high sequence and structural similarity between MANF and CDNF must reflect their common biological ancestry and function. Sequence alignments (Supplementary data available at PEDS online, Figure S2) show that most of the conserved residues (.80% identity) lie on helices a3, a4, a5 and 310 with the totally conserved residues mainly on a3 and a5 (Fig. 4). The conserved area is comprised of two regions, one including R44, K46, R49 and K96 (MANF numbering), and the other, at approximately 908 to the first, includes K70, K80, K84, K86 and K87 (Fig. 4). The conserved Lys and Arg (Fig. 4C) may bind lipids. The other side is largely non-conserved, except for E7, R15, R23, E47 and Y97 (Fig. 4B). 238

In vivo, CDNF protects and rescues midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Lindholm et al., 2007) and MANF has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia (Airavaara et al., 2009). However, only human MANF, not CDNF, rescues the Drosophila melanogaster MANF gene knockout lethality (Palgi et al., 2009). This allowed us to identify the key surface residues responsible. We looked for surface residues that are similar or identical in human and D. melanogaster MANF but different in human CDNF. They occur in three patches: K38, R41 on helix a2 (S, L in CDNF); L1, I10, E79 on helix a1 and a5 (G, K, M in CDNF) and N66, K70 and K88 on helix a4 and a5 (S, R and L) (Fig. 4A and C). Of these, L1, N66, K70, E79 and K88 are identical in all MANFs, suggesting that they are more important than the less well conserved I10, K38 and R41 (Fig. 4A). The functional differences between CDNF and MANF are thus presumably due to the MANFL1!GCDNF, MANF N66!SCDNF, MANFK70!RCDNF, MANFE79!MCDNF MANF and K88!LCDNF changes. Of these, the E79!M and K88!L changes are probably the most important; they are non-conservative changes next to the conserved positive region we believe is involved in membrane binding. We think I10 may also be important; though not as well conserved as E79 and K88, it is usually either I or V in

Discussion

Interaction with membranes
As mentioned above, both saposins and the SAPLIPs appear to interact with membranes. The mechanisms, nonetheless, may be different. The mammalian saposins A ­D are acidic proteins with isoelectric points ( pI) around four to five and they seem to extract target lipids from membranes (Ahn et al., 2003). Saposin C appears to induce membrane fusion of anionic phospholipid vesicles at acidic pH through positively charged lysines (Qi and Chu, 2004). Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2005) showed that lysine residues in a1 and a5 anchor saposin C to the membrane by interacting with the head group of the anionic phospholipids. On the other hand, NK-lysin and granulysin are basic proteins that lyse cells, and the positively charged residues on the surface of helices a2 and a3 (Supplementary data available at PEDS online, Figure S3) may be required for membrane binding and lysis (Linde et al., 2005). In this respect, too, the MANF and CDNF SAPLIPs seem to be more similar to NK-lysin and granulysin than to other SAPLIPs. Their calculated pIs are 7.7 and 8.5, respectively. However, unlike granulysin and NK-lysin, the surface charge distribution is relatively even. The conserved positively charged residues occur in two patches, while negatively charged residues are evenly spread over the surface (Fig. 5). Nonetheless--and like saposin C, granulysin and NK-lysin-- MANF and CDNF have conserved Lys and Arg on helices 240

The MANF and CDNF N-terminal domains are SAPLIPs: the first found in neuroprotection, neurorestoration and in the ER stress response. The conserved Lys and Arg residues in MANF/CDNF could bind negatively charged lipid headgroups in the membrane, but the mode of action of MANF/ CDNF is still unclear. Do secreted MANF and CDNF interact with membrane lipids, or with a transmembrane (lipo) protein receptor? Either way, novel neuroprotective and neurorestorative pathways must exist. The differences between MANF and CDNF are due to the MANFE79!MCDNF, MANF K88!LCDNF and possibly MANFI10!KCDNF changes; these are significant changes in charge next to the most conserved patch on the surface of the molecule (Fig. 4). Unclear, however, is whether MANF and CDNF multimerise and if it is functionally significant. Although CDNF crystallises as a dimer at low pH, it is in the closed, rather than the open, domain-swapped conformations seen in saposins B and C (Ahn et al., 2003; Rossmann et al., 2008). In addition, the surface area buried in the dimer is rather small. Furthermore, the CXXC motif may be involved in metalbinding or in reductase or disulphide isomerase activity; such motifs occur in metal-binding proteins, in thioredoxins (Collet et al., 2003) and can have redox-independent disulphide isomerase activity (Horibe et al., 2004). Under ER stress, MANF is both upregulated (Mizobuchi et al., 2007) and cytoprotective (Apostolou et al., 2008), but initial tests have failed to detect generalised oxidoreductase activity (Mizobuchi et al., 2007). Nonetheless, MANF and CDNF are clearly two-domain, bifunctional proteins with very different N- and C-terminal domains. We therefore ascribe the neuroprotective function to the N-terminal SAPLIP domain, and cytoprotection and involvement in the ER stress response to the natively unfolded C-terminal CXXC domain. Studies to demonstrate this and to identify the cellular targets of MANF and CDNF are underway. Acknowledgements
