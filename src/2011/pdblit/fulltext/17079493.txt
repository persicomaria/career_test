We have determined the crystal structure of the human base excision repair enzyme DNA polymerase (Pol ) in complex with a 1-nt gapped DNA substrate containing a template N2-guanine adduct of the tumorigenic ( )-benzo[c]phenanthrene 4R,3S-diol 2S,1R-epoxide in the gap. Nucleotide insertion opposite this adduct favors incorrect purine nucleotides over the correct dCMP and hence can be mutagenic. The structure reveals that the phenanthrene ring system is stacked with the base pair immediately 3 to the modified guanine, thereby occluding the normal binding site for the correct incoming nucleoside triphosphate. The modified guanine base is displaced downstream and prevents the polymerase from achieving the catalytically competent closed conformation. The incoming nucleotide binding pocket is distorted, and the adducted deoxyguanosine is in a syn conformation, exposing its Hoogsteen edge, which can hydrogen-bond with dATP or dGTP. In a reconstituted base excision repair system, repair of a deaminated cytosine (i.e., uracil) opposite the adducted guanine was dramatically decreased at the Pol insertion step, but not blocked. The efficiency of gap-filling dCMP insertion opposite the adduct was diminished by >6 orders of magnitude compared with an unadducted templating guanine. In contrast, significant misinsertion of purine nucleotides (but not dTMP) opposite the adducted guanine was observed. Pol also misinserts a purine nucleotide opposite the adduct with ungapped DNA and exhibits limited bypass DNA synthesis. These results indicate that Pol -dependent base excision repair of uracil opposite, or replication through, this bulky DNA adduct can be mutagenic.
DNA adduct DNA repair fidelity mutagenesis

olycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph) are tumorigenic in animal models and thus are presumed human carcinogens. They are widely introduced into the environment through combustion of various organic materials (1). Because of the widespread presence of B[a]P in the environment, its impact on human health has been a subject of intensive study. It is present in cigarette smoke, automobile exhaust, barbequed meats and fish, and as a contaminant in other foods (2, 3). It is converted to a highly reactive electrophilic metabolite, ( )7R,8S-dihydroxy-9S,10R-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P DE) (4), which can damage DNA by forming adducts, mainly at the exocyclic 2- and 6-amino groups of guanine and adenine, respectively (5). B[a]P and its diol epoxide metabolites (6­8) induce lung tumors in a newborn mouse model, and B[a]P DE­DNA adducts have been implicated in human lung cancer (9). B[c]Ph is another well studied PAH that is activated in the liver to carcinogenic diol epoxide metabolites (4). The ( )-1R,2S-epoxy-3S,4R-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[c]phenanthrenes (B[c]Ph DEs) are among the most mutagenic and carcinogenic diol epoxides identified to date (10­

12). Fig. 1 illustrates the structures of B[c]Ph, its metabolite (B[c]Ph DE), and the adduct derived from trans-opening of the epoxide ring by the exocyclic 2-amino group of guanine in DNA, which is the subject of the present investigation. Bulky PAH-derived lesions can persist in human tissues when cellular repair enzymes fail to correct these lesions (13). The presence of these lesions in the genome blocks replicative DNA polymerases. If these lesions are not repaired, they must be bypassed for replication to continue. Bypass DNA synthesis occurs when a translesional DNA polymerase is recruited to the site of DNA damage and inserts a nucleotide opposite the adduct. DNA synthesis can be error-free or error-prone. The resulting base pair is then extended by either the same DNA polymerase or an auxiliary polymerase. Because replication of these adducts is known to result in mutations (14­16), mutagenic bypass provides a mechanism for adduct-induced tumor initiation and progression. Several DNA repair mechanisms protect cells from the deleterious effects of DNA lesions. For example, bulky DNA adducts such as PAH adducts and the formamidopyrimidine adduct of aflatoxin are primarily repaired by nucleotide excision repair (17, 18), although some unstable B[a]P DE adducts might promote depurination and elicit the base excision repair (BER) pathway (19). Notably, B[c]Ph DE adducts at N6 of adenine are particularly resistant to nucleotide excision repair (18), possibly because their intercalation into DNA results in minimal destabilization of the DNA helix (20) thereby rendering the damage undetectable by repair enzymes. The fate of B[c]Ph DE­DNA adducts and other bulky carcinogen­DNA adducts depends on the ability of the DNA repair machinery to repair the lesions (21). Furthermore, individuals differ in their DNA repair capacity, and this may be a risk factor for cancer (22). In some cases, unrepaired adducts can persist in genomic DNA and lead to mutations that eventually initiate carcinogenesis (23). It is well

The tetrahydrobenzo ring numbering system and the absolute configuration designations for the diastereomer used in the present study are shown. Note that the absolute configuration at C1 of the epoxide inverts upon trans-adduct formation. Fig. 2. In vitro BER of uracil opposite B[c]Ph DE­ dG using purified human enzymes. A 5 32P-labeled uracil-containing duplex DNA substrate (unadducted or containing the B[c]Ph DE­ dG adduct) was pretreated with 50 nM UDG and apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease. The reaction mixtures were then supplemented as indicated with 500 M dCTP or dGTP and or 4 mM ATP, 100 nM Pol , and 200 nM DNA ligase I. Reactions were terminated after a 30-min incubation at 37°C. The positions of the UDG apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease-incised product and subsequent 1-nt addition are indicated.

known that such lesions exhibit differential rates of repair as a function of cell type, DNA sequence, and chromatin status, among other factors (24, 25). Persistent bulky adducts in DNA block the progression of replicative DNA polymerases (26, 27) and RNA polymerase II (28). DNA polymerase (Pol ), the smallest eukaryotic polymerase (39 kDa) belonging to the X-family of DNA polymerases, has been extensively characterized biologically, kinetically, dynamically, and structurally (for a recent review, see ref. 29). Pol lacks an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease activity and accordingly, it has been described as an error-prone polymerase. This is supported by the observation that up-regulation or over-expression of Pol can result in genomic instability (30). Although the primary cellular role of Pol is to provide lyase and nucleotidyl transferase activities during BER of simple DNA base lesions, Pol has also been implicated in the replication bypass of a variety of bulky DNA lesions. Over-expression of Pol can result in decreased sensitivity to agents that generate bulky DNA adducts, such as cisplatin (30), or UV radiation (31). In to bypass UVvitro assays demonstrate the ability of Pol induced (31) and cisplatin-induced DNA lesions (32). The aims of the current study were to determine whether Pol could correctly or incorrectly insert a nucleotide opposite another class of bulky DNA lesions, adducts derived from B[c]Ph DE, and to examine the structural basis for the enzyme's response to these adducts. In addition, because it is known that cytosine is more prone to deamination (i.e., conversion to uracil) in single-stranded DNA or when mispaired (33), we examined whether uracil positioned opposite this bulky adduct is a substrate for BER. Thus, we speculate that anomalies in the DNA structure such as that induced by bulky guanine adducts could induce cytosine deamination and subsequent BER. Finally, we determined a crystal structure of Pol in complex with gapped DNA containing a B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct in the templating base position to provide molecular insight into the observed error-prone DNA synthesis. Results
BER of a Uracil Opposite B[c]Ph DE­ dG. Because improperly basepaired cytosines are prone to deamination (33), we reasoned that persistent B[c]Ph DE-adducted guanine in genomic DNA could be encountered by the BER system during repair of uracil. In this
17232 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0605069103

scenario, the BER system would insert a dNMP residue opposite the adducted guanine. Accordingly, we examined whether a uracil positioned opposite a B[c]Ph DE­dG could serve as a substrate for removal by uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) and whether the resultant abasic site could be repaired by purified human BER enzymes. Uracil positioned opposite an adducted guanine was a good substrate for purified UDG, and the abasic site product from this reaction was a good substrate for apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease incision (Fig. 2). A mixture of purified BER enzymes was unable to conduct efficient repair of uracil when dCTP was the only dNTP present for insertion opposite the modified guanine. However, in the presence of dGTP, a significant misincorporation opposite the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct was observed in this reconstituted BER system.
Misinsertion Opposite the B[c]Ph DE­ dG. We made use of a single-nucleotide gapped oligonucleotide substrate with guanine or B[c]Ph DE­dG in the templating position to conduct qualitative and quantitative steady-state kinetic measurements for Pol -dependent insertion of alternative dNTPs. Some insertion of each dNTP opposite the adducted guanine was observed (Fig. 3); however, the efficiency for insertion of each dNMP was 105to 106-fold lower than that observed for an unadducted guanine template with a correct dCTP (Table 1, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The extremely low level of dCMP insertion observed was consistent with the failure of the reconstituted BER system to replace deoxyuridine with deoxycytosine opposite the adduct, as noted above. Surprisingly, preferential misinsertion of purine nucleotides was found relative to insertion of pyrimidine nucleotides (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Consistent with these observations, the catalytic efficiency for the misinsertion of dGMP was much higher (58-fold) than that for correct dCMP insertion opposite the adducted Pol

The positions of the primer (n) and products (n 1) are indicated. Note that the mobility of the extended products depends on the sequence of the products (i.e., misinsertion of dGMP opposite the adduct results in a slower migrating product than misinsertion of dAMP).

guanine (Table 1) resulting in a misinsertion frequency of 0.98 (kcat Km,dCTP)]. [i.e., (kcat Km,dGTP) (kcat Km,dGTP To determine whether Pol could bypass the lesion (insert and extend), an open DNA template containing the B[c]Ph DE-adducted guanine was examined. A 5 -32P-labeled 9-mer primer strand was annealed to a 21-mer template oligonucleotide, where the adducted guanine was two bases (guanines) downstream of the primer 3 end. With the B[c]Ph DE-adducted guanine template, nucleotide incorporation opposite the first guanine was efficient, but a strong block to primer extension was observed opposite the second adducted guanine (Fig. 4). Steadystate kinetic analysis indicates that insertion opposite the guanine 3 to the lesion is almost unaffected by the presence of the neighboring adduct (Table 1). Although the enzyme pauses before the adduct, misinsertion of dGTP, but not dCTP, is readily observed. The misinsertion of dGMP is easily identified by the slower mobility of the product bands relative to that of a correct dCMP insertion. A low level of bypass DNA synthesis is also observed that is more prominent with longer incubations or in the presence of higher enzyme concentrations. The results described above indicate that Pol can insert dGMP, but not dCMP, when the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct is situated in the polymerase active site, suggesting that BER of sites opposite this lesion is error-prone and could result in mutations.

Products from time courses (0 ­30 min) for lesion bypass of unadducted or B[c]Ph DE-adducted open template primers are shown. The position of the insertion products opposite the unadducted (dCMP insertion) and adducted-dG (dGMP insertion) are indicated. Note that only misinsertion of dGMP opposite the adduct is observed.

DE­dG adduct (Fig. 1) was annealed with a 9-mer primer strand and a 5-mer 5 -phosphorylated downstream oligonucleotide to create a 2-nt gapped DNA substrate with an unadducted guanine 3 to the adducted guanine. The DNA substrate was mixed with Pol and ddCTP MgCl2, and incubated under crystallization conditions with the objective of obtaining a ternary complex crystal structure (34). Under these conditions with an unadducted DNA substrate, Pol inserts ddCMP, effectively terminating the primer strand and permitting binding of the next correct dNTP, ddCTP, without catalysis. Crystals were obtained and analyzed (Table 2, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site); however, the structure revealed only a binary DNA complex. In this structure one ddCMP residue had been inserted opposite the first unadducted guanine adjacent to the lesion, but binding of the incoming ddCTP opposite the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct was not observed. In this binary complex, the density for the phenanthrene ring system of the adduct was easily discerned (Fig. 5) and is stacked with the base pair formed by the cytosine at the primer terminus and its

complementary guanine in the template strand, and occupies the position normally occupied by the incoming dNTP base (Fig. 5 and Figs. 6 and 7, which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The binding pocket for the correct incoming nucleotide is thus occluded. Upon binding the correct dNTP, many DNA polymerases undergo substrate and protein conformational adjustments (29, 35). For Pol , the N subdomain (fingers of right-handed DNA polymerases) closes upon the nascent base pair. Inspection of the structure revealed that Pol was in the open conformation, and the structure was similar to that previously reported for the binary complex with unadducted DNA (1BPX) (34). Superposition of the C s of the 1BPX structure and the lesion-containing structure resulted in a rmsd of only 0.58 Å. Several amino acid side-chains monitor the conformation of the N subdomain. The conformations of many of these enzyme side chains are also similar in these two binary complex structures. Asp-192 coordinates both active site Mg2 ions in the ``active'' ternary substrate complex (36). However, in the inactive binary DNA complex with unadducted or B[c]Ph DE-adducted DNA, Asp-192 forms a salt bridge with Arg-258. In contrast, Tyr-271 forms a hydrogen bond with N2 of the unadducted guanine, but due to the intercalation of the phenanthrene moiety, the adducted guanine has been displaced away from Tyr-271. As noted above, the position normally occupied by the templating guanine and the incoming dNTP is occupied by the hydrocarbon moiety of the B[c]Ph DE-adduct, and the templating adducted guanine is displaced downstream from the active site. This displacement of the adducted guanine sterically hinders closing of the N subdomain, effectively enlarging the active site.
Adducted DNA Structure. Although structures derived from NMR have been determined for a number of PAH-adducted oligonucleotides, only two crystal structures are available with B[a]P adducts bound to a DNA polymerases (37, 38). Accordingly, the interactions of the B[c]Ph DE-adducted DNA molecule with the polymerase are of great interest. Although there is significant electron density for the phenanthrene ring system, there is less density for the tetrahydrobenzo ring making conclusions concerning conformation speculative. The modeled aromatic ring system in the present structure exhibits a twist of 17°, similar to that observed in an NMR-derived structure (26°) of the same B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct diastereomer in duplex DNA (39), and

formation with syn-glycosidic torsion and stacking of the hydrocarbon over the primer terminus was observed by NMR in the absence of enzyme for a template primer containing a trans 10S B[a]P DE­dG adduct (same diastereomer as the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct used here) at the first unpaired template position in a template primer junction (41). In the Pol structure, torsion angles that define the orientation of the hydrocarbon relative to the modified guanine are [(N1(G)138° and [(C2(G)-N2(G)C2(G)-N2(G)-C1(B[c]Ph)] C1(B[c]Ph)-C2(B[c]Ph)] 112°. These angles are comparable to angles of 88° 159° and 156° 109° the corresponding observed in the solution NMR structures for template primer with the B[a]P DE­dG adduct (41) and full duplex DNA containing the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct (39), respectively. Discussion Although attempts to crystallize a ternary substrate complex of Pol with DNA and the correct incoming dNTP opposite the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct were unsuccessful, we were able to obtain the structure of a binary complex with a B[c]Ph DE­dG-adducted template primer bound at the Pol active site. Thus, it provides clues to how this adduct favors misinsertion opposite the lesion, the necessary first step in lesion-induced mutagenesis. Two previous crystal structures for DNA polymerases in complex with PAHadducted template primers represented potential intermediates for primer extension beyond the lesion; i.e., the lesion is positioned opposite the primer terminus. A structure of the ternary substrate complex of DNA polymerase I fragment from Bacillus stearothermophilus shows dCTP Watson­Crick hydrogen bonding to B[a]P DE-adducted deoxyguanosine, which is in an anticonformation (38). The adduct is situated in the minor groove, and extensive distortions in the polymerase active site and the DNA are observed. These distortions extend upstream from the postinsertion site. A ternary complex structure of the Y-family DNA polymerase Dpo4 from Sulfolobus solfataricus with a B[a]P-adducted adenine (N6major groove adduct) opposite the primer terminus displayed two conformations of the adduct: one with the hydrocarbon portion lying in the major groove and perpendicular to the nascent base pair (dT dATP) and the other with the hydrocarbon partially inserted between the primer terminus and nascent base pair (37). In both structures, the adducted deoxyadenosine is in an anticonformation. Neither conformation of this deoxyadenosine adduct had a significant effect on the polymerase conformation as judged by the low C rmsd as compared with an unadducted DNA substrate. In the present structure of a 1-nucleotide gapped DNA Pol complex, this BER intermediate DNA is distorted in the region of the bulky B[c]Ph DE moiety. The phenanthrene ring system stacks immediately adjacent to the base pair at the 3 end of the primer strand thereby occluding the dCTP binding site. The templating deoxyguanosine is displaced downstream and has rotated about its glycosidic bond to a syn-conformation (Fig. 5). The displaced guanine also sterically prevents the N subdomain from closing. These structural attributes are consistent with the poor insertion efficiency exhibited by Pol with the adducted substrate. Correct nucleotide insertion efficiency is diminished 6 million-fold (Table 1). The inability to obtain a ternary substrate complex with ddCTP strongly suggests that this is partly due to a dramatically reduced binding affinity for ddCTP resulting from phenanthrene incursion into the dNTP binding site and the inability of the N subdomain to close. Whereas correct nucleotide insertion is dramatically decreased, dGTP misinsertion is hardly affected relative to that observed with an unadducted templating guanine (42). Accordingly, dGMP misinsertion is greatly preferred over dCMP incorporation translating to a misinsertion frequency approaching 1. Additionally, dAMP insertion is also preferred over correct nucleotide incorporation. More importantly, the similar efficiencies observed for these misinsertions with adducted and unadducted

also predicted by theoretical calculations (40). The adducted deoxyguanosine in the Pol structure has a syn-glycosidic conformation, with a angle of 58°, as opposed to the normal anticonformation of the same adduct in duplex DNA (39).

templates suggest that misinsertion most likely occurs from an open polymerase conformation because the adduct stabilizes this conformation (35). The preferential insertion of purine, over pyrimidine, triphosphates could occur by several mechanisms. The preferred insertion of purine nucleotides is consistent with untemplated insertions, such as those observed opposite an abasic site (43). The A-family T7 DNA polymerase preferentially inserts dAMP and dGMP opposite the 3 -thymine in a cis­syn thymine dimer, which undergoes a base displacement to create an intermediate that mimics an abasic site (44). A crystallographic structure of the T7 DNA polymerase binary complex with the 3 -thymine in the templating position shows the thymine dimer rotated out of the polymerase active site (45). Although the adducted guanine in the Pol structure is displaced downstream, the phenanthrene ring occludes the normal binding pocket for the nascent base pair. However, the ability of purine bases to stack with aromatic rings suggests that dATP or dGTP may simply be stacking with the displaced guanine or with the phenanthrene ring system in the productive complex for purine nucleotide misinsertion. Such a stacking arrangement of purine bases was observed in a structure of a ternary complex of Pol with a templating 8-oxodG that had been incubated with dATP (46). In another possible mechanism, the syn-conformation of the adducted deoxyguanosine could serve as a template for purine nucleotide misinsertion. In the syn-conformation, guanine presents an alternate hydrogen-bonding pattern through its Hoogsteen edge (hydrogen bond acceptors O6 and N7). A mechanism involving Hoogsteen base pairing with minor base tautomers was proposed for the preferential insertion of purines opposite B[a]P DE-(syn)dG by Pol (47). An alternate base-pairing scheme that does not require rare base tautomers is also possible, because anti-dGTP could pair with syn-dG by donating two hydrogen bonds (N1 and N2 with O6 and N7, respectively). Likewise, anti-dATP could donate a single hydrogen bond (N6 with O6 of guanine) or a second hydrogen bond if N1 was protonated (N1 with N7 of guanine). Such conformations and hydrogen bonding have been observed in crystallographic structures of these mispairs in duplex DNA (48, 49). The lower insertion efficiency and binding affinity for dATP relative to dGTP is consistent with the less stable base pair suggested by this mechanism (Table 1). Notably, however, a Hoogsteen base-pairing mechanism would require a severe buckle in the nascent purine-purine mispair if the adduct was not displaced into the major groove. Recent studies of translesion bypass DNA polymerases belonging to the Y-family indicated that some of these enzymes could synthesize past a base with an unrepaired bulky lesion (50). Such bypass DNA synthesis sometimes occurs with insertion of a base complementary to the adducted base, but in many cases synthesis is with an incorrect base leading to a mutation. For example, Pol was accurate in bypassing a B[a]P DE­dG adduct (51, 52), but Pol was error-prone (47, 53). A crystal structure of Pol with unadducted DNA showed the templating base in a synconformation with Hoogsteen base pairing to the incoming dNTP (54). It was suggested that insertion opposite a base with a bulky lesion, such as an N2-guanine adduct, could occur if the lesion could rotate from the minor groove into the more spacious major groove through an anti to syn change in the glycosidic angle of the templating deoxyguanosine, as observed in our present structure. In summary, both Pol -dependent nucleotide insertion into a gapped DNA BER intermediate (Fig. 2) and replication bypass (Fig. 4) were inefficient and error-prone, with favored misin1.

sertion of purine nucleotides opposite the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct. Translesional DNA polymerases generally exhibit low catalytic activities due to the openness of their active sites (35). Interestingly, the B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct opens the Pol active site by displacing the templating adducted guanine downstream thereby interfering with closing of the N subdomain. Two highly significant features of the present structure are the stacked position of the phenanthrene ring system and the synconformation of the adducted guanine, which suggests two possible mechanisms for preferential incorporation of purine nucleotides: untemplated insertions, favored by the enlarged binding site and possible purine stacking interactions with the aromatic hydrocarbon, or Hoogsteen base pairing of the incoming dNTP and the syn-dG adduct. Either or both of these mechanisms could play a pivotal role in the observed errorprone DNA synthesis observed opposite this adduct with Pol resulting in potentially mutagenic consequences. Materials and Methods
Adducted Oligonucleotides. A 21-mer oligonucleotide used in kinetic and BER repair assays, 5 -GCG ATC CGA CGG CGC ATC AGC-3 , with the trans 1S B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct (Fig. 1) at position 11 (underlined G), was synthesized by a semiautomated method as described (55) by using a diastereomerically pure 1S B[c]Ph-dG phosphoramidite (56). A shorter B[c]Ph-adducted 16mer that was used for crystal structure determination, 5 -CCG ACG GCG CAT CAG C-3 , with the same trans 1S B[c]Ph DE­dG adduct at position 6 from the 5 end, was synthesized essentially as above. Primer Extension Assay. Pol was preincubated with template primer DNA before initiation of the reaction by addition of dNTP Mg2 . The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 nM Pol , 200 nM DNA, and 200 M each dNTP. After various time intervals, reactions were quenched and the products were analyzed as described previously (42).

In Vitro BER Assay. An in vitro BER assay was performed essen-

tially as described previously (57).
