Avian haemoglobins and structural basis of high affinity for oxygen: structure of bar-headed goose aquomet haemoglobin
Haemoglobin from the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) has higher oxygen af®nity than that from its lowland relatives such as greylag goose (A. anser). The crystal structure of barÊ headed goose aquomet haemoglobin was determined at 2.3 A resolution and compared with the structures of the goose oxy, human, horse and other avian haemoglobins and the sequences of other avian haemoglobins. Four amino-acid residues differ between greylag goose and bar-headed goose haemoglobins, among which Ala119 and Asp125 in barheaded goose haemoglobin reduces the contacts between the 1 and 1 subunits compared with Pro and Glu, respectively, and therefore may increase the oxygen af®nity by loosening the 11 interface. Compared with human oxy haemoglobin, the relative orientation of two  dimers in the bar-headed goose aquomet and oxy Hbs are rotated by about 4 , indicating a unique quaternary structural difference from the typical R state. This new `RH' state is probably correlated with the higher oxygen af®nity of bar-headed goose haemoglobin.

1. Introduction
The bar-headed goose (A. indicus) is one of the most successful vertebrates to survive and reproduce at high altitude. It lives in central Asia and Qinghai Lake in China at an altitude of 4000±6000 m, but migrates in late autumn to the plains of northwest India, during which it ¯ies over the Himalayas, $9000 m in altitude. In contrast to its lowland relatives such as the greylag goose (A. anser), the bar-headed goose can even tolerate short exposure to at least 10 700 m (Black & Tenny, 1980; Swan, 1970). Therefore, it has long been considered a favourable subject for studying the mechanism of high-altitude hypoxia respiration. In addition to physiological factors, the ability of the bar-headed goose to tolerate extremely hypoxic conditions is attributed to the increased oxygen af®nity of its haemoglobin (Hb) (Petschow et al., 1977; Rollema & Bauer, 1979). In the absence of inositol pentaphosphate (IPP), an allosteric regulator of avian Hb, the oxygen af®nity of the bar-headed goose Hb is slightly higher (P50 = 0.263 kPa in 100 mM ClÀ at pH 7.2, 298 K) than that of greylag goose Hb (P50 = 0.368 kPa), whereas in the presence of IPP the difference is much enhanced (P50 of 2.684 versus 4.066 kPa). The amino-acid sequences of the major Hb of these two species differ at four positions, Gly (greylag) versus Ser (bar-headed goose) at 18, Ala versus Val at 63, Pro versus Ala at 119 and Glu versus Asp at 125 (Oberthur et al., 1981). To identify the effects of these differences on the Hb structure and to elucidate the structural basis of high oxygen af®nity, we determined the structure of bar-headed goose

and the other is the structure of chicken HbD, which is a minor component of adult chicken Hb (Knapp et al., 1999). The structure of the bar-headed goose oxy Hb supports the speculation on the role of 119 mentioned above. Here, the structure of bar-headed goose aquomet Hb is presented in which the haem iron Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ and the ligand oxygen is replaced by a water molecule. This met Hb form was stable and the easiest to obtain experimentally. The aquomet Hb structure was analyzed in detail and compared with the bar-headed goose oxy Hb, human oxy Hb, horse aquomet Hb and chicken HbD structures. The study revealed a unique quaternary structure feature for the liganded bar-headed goose Hb and critical roles for two amino-acid differences at 119 and 125 between bar-headed goose and greylag goose Hbs, both of which may contribute to the higher oxygen af®nity.

aquomet Hb and compared it with some relevant Hb structures. The Hb molecule consists of two - and two -subunits arranged in pseudo-222 symmetry. The quaternary structure changes allosterically in response to ligand binding, generating the R state (relaxed, liganded) or T state (tense, ligand-free). The 11 interface (packing interface) and the 12 interface (sliding interface) are crucial to the oxygen af®nity and the allosteric transition between the R and T states, respectively (Perutz et al., 1987). The Pro119 (greylag goose) to Ala119 (bar-headed goose) mutation was predicted to eliminate a van der Waals contact with Leu55 in the 11 interface (Oberthur, Brauneitzer et al., 1982); the reduction of the van der Waals contact can loosen the 11 interface, thereby destabilizing the T state with low oxygen af®nity and favouring the R state with high oxygen af®nity (Perutz, 1983; Perutz et al., 1987; Hiebl et al., 1987). Therefore, it was speculated that the high oxygen af®nity of bar-headed goose Hb and the mechanism of hypoxia adaptation mainly arise from the loosening of the 11 interface (Oberthur, Brauneitzer et al., 1982; Perutz, 1983; Perutz et al., 1987; Hiebl et al., 1987). The Pro3Ala119 and Met3Ser55 mutations were introduced individually into human Hb by protein engineering; increased oxygen af®nities were observed for the two mutants at a level similar to that on going from greylag goose Hb to bar-headed goose Hb (Jessen et al., 1991; Weber et al., 1993). How such amino-acid differences affect the tertiary and quaternary structure of Hb and thereby its oxygen af®nity can be answered by studying the structure of bar-headed goose Hb and its differences from the Hbs of lowland animals. Of all the Hb structures previously solved, only two are avian Hbs. One is the structure of bar-headed goose oxy Hb determined previously in our laboratory (Zhang et al., 1996)

The bar-headed goose aquomet Hb was prepared, puri®ed and crystallized as described previously (Lu et al., 1989). Brie¯y, red blood cells were prepared from blood drawn from the vein of a bar-headed goose, washed with 0.82% NaCl and lysed with the same volume of distilled water. Cell membranes and other insoluble materials were removed by adding half a volume of CCl4, shaking and centrifuging at 4000 rev minÀ1 for 20 min. Solid K3Fe(CN)6 powder was added to the supernatant solution containing Hb at 33.3 mg mlÀ1. The mixture was stirred for 10 min and then dialyzed against 10 mM NaCl. The sample was further puri®ed on Sephadex100 with 10 mM NaCl as buffer. The puri®ed protein was dialyzed against 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 and concentrated to 50±60 mg mlÀ1. Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion method at 291 K. A 10 ml droplet containing 5 ml Hb solution, 2 ml 20% PEG 6000 and 3 ml 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 was equilibrated against 1 ml reservoir solution containing 12% PEG 6000. Crystals can attain maximum dimensions of 0.6 Â 0.6 Â 0.4 mm in 7±10 d. The crystals belong to space group P42212, with unit-cell paraÊ meters a = b = 81.5, c = 107.2 A. Each asymmetric unit contains half a molecule or one  dimer, which is related to the other half by the crystallographic twofold axis. The VM Ê value is 2.66 A3 DaÀ1 and the solvent content is 54%. Diffraction data were collected at 293 K on a multiwire area detector X-200B (Siemens Co.) using Cu K radiation Ê (wavelength 1.5418 A) from a Rigaku RU-300 rotating-anode X-ray generator operated at 250 mA and 50 kV. The crystalto-detector distance was 154 mm. A total of 714 frames were collected at 2 = 20 , 1 = 45 and 3 in the range À20 to 160 with an interval of 0.25 . The exposure time per frame was 120 s. The data were processed with XENGEN (Howard et al., 1987).

completeness of the overall data set is 95.2% and the Ê completeness of the highest resolution shell (2.3±2.41 A) is 70.1%. The data statistics are listed in Table 1.
2.2. Structure determination and refinement

The initial phases were determined by the molecularreplacement method using AUTOMR (Matsuura, 1991). The Ê 2.1 A structure of horse aquomet Hb  dimer (PDB 2mhb; Ladner et al., 1977) was used as the search model; it has a sequence identity of 71.6% with the -subunit of bar-headed goose Hb and 67.1% with the -subunit. The model was rotated with arbitrary angles in a spherical polar coordinate system and then placed in an orthogonal cell with dimensions Ê 100 Â 100 Â 100 A and P1 symmetry. The rotation function Ê was calculated using data in the resolution range 10±4 A with Ê within the spherical polar angles an integration radius of 25 A 0 < 2 < 90 , 0 < 9 < 360 , 0 < 1 < 360 and with an interval of 5 . The top 20 independent rotation-function solutions were used for translation-function calculations using data in the Ê resolution range 12±8 A. The top ten independent translation solutions were then used in rigid-body re®nement in the Ê 10±4 A resolution range. The best solution has an R factor of 0.428 and a correlation coef®cient of 0.582 and corresponds to the highest peak in the rotation function. The rotation angles and translation vectors were applied to the model and the main chains of the model in the goose aquomet Hb unit cell were plotted. The molecular packing in the crystal lattice is reasonable. For model rebuilding, the residues in horse Hb were replaced by those in bar-headed goose Hb and the model was

adjusted manually based on 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps. The model was then re®ned and rebuilt for a number of cycles using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and XFIT (McRee, 1992), respectively. An initial model, consisting of 2325 non-H atoms from 287 residues and two haems, was re®ned. All 15 772 Ê re¯ections in the resolution range 26.8±2.3 A were used in the re®nement, of which 14 638 re¯ections were used as the working set and 1084 re¯ections (6.9%) were used in the test set (Table 1). The initial B factors of all atoms were set to Ê 15 A2. The starting temperature in simulated annealing was 2500 K and the cooling rate was 25 K per cycle. Individual B factors were then re®ned. In each re®nement cycle, the weight factor WA estimated by the program was scaled by 0.5 to obtain the lowest Rfree, the re®nement target is a maximumlikelihood target and overall anisotropic B-factor correction Ê with a lower resolution limit of 6 A and bulk-solvent corrections were applied to the data. The model was harmonically restrained during the slow-cool annealing re®nement with Ê energy constants of 42 kJ molÀ1 A2 for all C and water O Ê atoms and 21 kJ molÀ1 A2 for other atoms, except for nine residues at the N- and C-termini that have poor electron densities. After each re®nement cycle, ' A-weighted 2mFo À DFc and mFo À DFc maps were calculated which guided further manual rebuilding. Water molecules were added in the last few cycles using the automatic water-picking protocol in CNS with a cutoff of 1.0' for the ' A-weighted Ê 2mFo À DFc map; if they were within 2.6±4.0 A of any atom or Ê 2.2±4.0 A of the O or N atoms then their B factors re®ned to a Ê value below 50 A2. The ®nal R factor is 0.197 and Rfree is 0.247. Ê The density level of the bulk-solvent model is 0.289 e AÀ3 and Ê its B factor is 29.7 A2. The statistics of the ®nal structure are summarized in Table 1.

The structures of bar-headed goose aquomet Hb, oxy Hb (PDB code 1a4f; Zhang et al., 1996), chicken HbD (1hbr; Knapp et al., 1999), human oxy Hb (1hho; Shaanan, 1983) and horse aquomet Hb (2mhb; Ladner et al., 1977) were aligned and visually compared using XTALVIEW (McRee, 1992). The contacts between the subunits and the quaternary geometry of the tetramers were calculated using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The ®tting frame de®ned by Zhang et al. (1996) was used for calculating the quaternary geometry of the tetramers. The ®tting residues are 3±13, 31±42, 54±73, 80±84, 97± 104, 117±136 and 26±37, 62±68, 106± 114 and 127±139, a total of 117 aminoacid residues and 468 atoms. These account for 40.8% of the main-chain

atoms in the  dimer. The ®tting frame is slightly different from that de®ned by Baldwin & Chothia (1979), in which the 11 contact interface was used as the reference region for comparison of different human Hb forms, but structural differences between goose and human Hb make the region used by Baldwin and Chothia less suitable for overlapping the coordinates. The criteria for van der Waals contacting Ê Ê Ê distances are CÐC, 4.1 A; CÐN, 3.8 A; CÐO, 3.7 A; NÐN, Ê ; NÐO, 3.4 A; OÐO, 3.3 A (Acqua et al., 1998).

3.1. Structure quality

The structure contains all 287 residues in the amino-acid sequence, two haems and 60 water molecules (Table 1), all of which ®t well to the electron-density map except for the terminal residues Lys139±Arg141, Val1 and Lys144± His146, which have high B factors. These terminal regions could be ¯exible in nature, as also evident from the deviations between different Hb structures (see below). An example electron-density map is shown in Fig. 1 for the region around the haem group of the -subunit. The stereochemical quality of the structure as assessed by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) is excellent (Table 1). In the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965), 92.6% of the residues are in the most favoured regions and 7.4% of the residues are in the additionally allowed

As in other known Hb structures, the -subunit contains seven helices, A±G, the -subunit contains eight helices, A±H, and the helices are linked by loops which are also called corners. The overall subunit structure of bar-headed goose aquomet Hb superimposes well with the four Hb structures being compared; the RMSDs are listed in Table 2(a). The smallest deviation among these structures is obviously that between the bar-headed goose oxy and aquomet Hbs. Their C traces are almost identical even though different initial models were used in molecular replacement, suggesting that the two structures converge in re®nement and are consistent with each other (Fig. 4). The next smallest difference is between the -subunits of goose Hb and chicken HbD; this may be attributable to the conservation of -subunit sequences of avian Hbs. However, the D subunit of chicken HbD deviates signi®cantly from the other A subunits, indicating that the three-dimensional structure of chicken D has larger differences from A of the goose, human and horse Hbs. The differences between goose A and chicken D reside mainly on the A helix, the AB and GH corners and two termini. The largest deviation is between the goose Hb and human or horse Hb. The differences between the goose Hb and human Hb reside mainly on the B and G helices and the AB, CE and GH corners in the -subunit, the A, D and F helices and the CD, DE, EF and GH corners in the -subunit and the two termini of each subunit. In general, except for the chicken D subunit, the deviations between the -subunits of goose

(Baldwin & Chothia, 1979; Perutz et al., 1987). Using the 11 dimer of human oxy or deoxy Hb as a template and then ®tting the 22 dimer, the 22 dimer of goose aquomet Hb is rotated Ê by 3.6 and translated by 1.1 A relative to that of human oxy  Ê Hb and rotated by 14.7 and translated by 2.6 A relative to that of human deoxy Hb (Table 2b). Goose oxy Hb has similar rotation angle and translation as aquomet Hb (Table 2b), indicating that both goose oxy and aquomet Hbs are in the R state, but are slightly different from the typical human R state. On the other hand, human CO-met Hb (2hco; Baldwin, 1980), horse met Hb, chicken oxy HbD and greylag goose oxy Hb (unpublished data) are in the typical human R state, with Ê rotation angles and translations of 1.2 and 0.4 A, 1.3 and Ê Ê Ê , 1.5 and 0.8 A or 1.6 and 1.3 A, respectively, relative 0.75 A Ê Ê to human oxy Hb and 14.9 and 1.3 A, 14.4 and 2.2 A, 14.3 Ê or 13.6 and 2.1 A, respectively, relative to human Ê and 1.7 A deoxy Hb (Table 2b). Obviously, the quaternary structures of both goose oxy and aquomet Hbs are signi®cantly different from that of human Y state as in carbonmonoxy human Hb Ypsilanti (1cmy; Smith et al., 1991; Table 2b) or cyanomet human Hb (Smith & Simmons, 1994). Therefore, the quaternary structural feature of bar-headed goose Hb is not a common feature in avian Hbs, but probably is a unique feature of bar-headed goose Hb or of Hbs from highland animals. We have named it the `RH' form, representing high oxygen af®nity. Further studies on Hbs of other highland animals are necessary to con®rm this hypothesis.
3.3. Subunit interface and the roles of four residues that differ between bar-headed goose and greylag goose Hbs

aquomet Hb and other Hbs are larger than those between the -subunits. The RMSDs between the tetramers (Table 2b) indicate that the quaternary structure of goose aquomet Hb is very similar to that of the goose oxy Hb, but signi®cantly different from chicken HbD, horse aquomet Hb and human oxy Hb. The quaternary structural differences can be further characterized by the rotation angles and the translations between the two dimers. For example, the major structural difference between the T and R states of human Hb is a rotation of 12±15 and a Ê translation of 0.8 A for one  dimer between the two states

In the 11 and 12 interfaces, the nature and number of residues in contact in goose aquomet and oxy Hbs are generally similar to those in chicken HbD, horse aquomet Hb and human oxy Hb. However, in the 12 and 12 interfaces, fewer 12 contacts and many more 12 contacts were found in goose Hb than human and horse Hbs. The numbers of residues in contact in goose aquomet, goose oxy, horse aquomet and human oxy Hbs are 28, 44, 64 and 52, respectively, for the 12 interface, and 31, 17, 2 and 0, respectively, for the 12 interface. Chicken HbD was not used for this comparison since the coordinates of two residues and 169 side-chain atoms are absent in the available coordinates. This is consistent with and could be a consequence of the unique quaternary structure described above and may be related to the IPP-binding site between 12 subunits (see below). The four amino-acid differences between greylag goose Hb and bar-headed goose Hb are all located on the subunit surface. Two of them, 119 and 125, are located on the 11 interface, while the other two, 18 and 63, are located on the molecular surface. Changing 119 from Pro in Figure 4 greylag goose Hb to Ala in bar-headed goose Hb  Alignment of the C traces of bar-headed goose aquomet Hb (thick line) with oxy Hb has been shown in previous studies to reduce the (thin line).

ening the 11 interface (Zhang et al., 1996). The aquomet Hb structure con®rmed this, as the closest distance between Ê Ala119 and Leu55 (4.52 A) is very similar to that observed Ê ) (Fig. 5a); both are too distant to make a in oxy Hb (4.56 A van der Waals contact. Such a change in the 11 interface might also be maintained in the goose deoxy Hb as the 11 interface, also known as the packing interface, undergoes little movement during the T±R interchange, whereas the 12 interface, also known as the sliding interface, undergoes signi®cant rotational movement during the T±R interchange. Additionally, chicken HbD also has a Pro119 and a Leu55 as in greylag goose Hb (Table 3) and in its crystal structure Pro119 CG makes a contact with Leu55 CD2 at a distance Ê of 3.88 A (Fig. 5a). Therefore, greylag goose Hb may be expected to possess this van der Waals contact which is absent in bar-headed goose Hb. In addition to 119, changing Glu125 in greylag goose Hb to Asp in bar-headed goose Hb may also contribute to the oxygen-af®nity increase. In bar-headed goose oxyHb, Asp125 OG1 makes one van der Waals contact with Ê Thr34 CG at a distance of 3.49 A. In aquomet Hb, the Ê (Fig. 5b). In chicken HbD, 125 is a Glu distance is 3.89 A residue as in greylag goose and is not in contact with Thr34 or any other residues in the -subunit. However, when Pro50 in chicken HbD is changed to His50 in bar-headed goose and greylag goose Hbs, the van der Waals contact between Ê Glu125 and Thr34 is absent, but Glu125 OE2 is 3.80 A from His50 NE2; when Asp 125 in bar-headed goose aquomet Hb is changed to the Glu conformation in chicken Ê HbD, the new OE2 atom is 3.77 A from His50 NE2 (Fig. 5b). Therefore, if the side-chain ¯exibility of Glu and His are considered, Glu125 may form a salt bridge with His50 in greylag goose Hb, the interaction force of which is usually stronger than that of a van der Waals contact. This may also conceivably contribute to the higher oxygen af®nity, as does the Pro1193Ala change. Residue pairs 119±55 and 34 (or 50)±125 are located on two opposite edges of the 11 interface, like two switches of the 11 dimer (Fig. 6). Subtle loosening of the interface on both ends may increase the oxygen-binding af®nity since the gap left at the 11 contact raises the oxygen af®nity because it relaxes the tension in the deoxy or T structure (Perutz, 1983).

The geometry of the haem group in goose aquomet Hb is different from that in goose oxy Hb, since the haem iron Fe2+ in the oxy form is oxidized to Fe3+ in the aquomet form and the ligand oxygen is replaced by a water molecule, but is similar to that in horse aquomet Hb (Table 4). The residues surrounding the haem-binding pocket are the same in the goose oxy and aquomet Hbs and are similar to those in horse aquomet Hb, except that Met32, Thr39, Phe46, Val62, Phe45 and Lys66 are also involved in the haem-binding pocket of the goose aquomet Hb. In the -subunit of the goose aquomet Hb, the side chain His45 NE2 forms a hydrogen bond with O1D of the propionate side chain in the Ê Ê haem at a distance of 2.79 A (2.74 A in horse metHb). In the -subunit, Lys66 NZ forms a hydrogen bond with O1A of the propionate side chain in the haem with a Ê distance of 2.95 A (which was not seen in horse metHb). These hydrogen bonds may be very important in ®xing haems in the

pockets. The haem pockets of both subunits are very close to neighbouring molecules and some water molecules are near the entrance of the haem pockets. In the -subunit, three waters form four hydrogen bonds with His58 and the haem; in the -subunit only one such hydrogen bond is present. The oxygen loading and unloading of Hbs is modulated by allosteric effectors such as H+, ClÀ and organic phosphate. The main organic phosphate allosteric effector for human Hb is d-2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), which binds to a positively charged pocket between the two -subunits of deoxy Hb tetramer (Arnone, 1972). It stabilizes the T-state Hb, leading to decreased oxygen af®nity and increased oxygen release in

tissue. The main allosteric effector for avian Hbs is inositold-1,3,4,5,6 pentaphosphate (IPP) and for ®sh Hbs is ATP or GTP (Perutz, 1983). Although no crystal structure of IPPbound avian Hb is currently available, the IPP-binding site could be mapped based on the structural similarity with DPGbound human Hb. The residues surrounding the IPP-binding pocket are indentical in bar-headed goose oxy, aquomet and chicken Hbs, including Val1, His2, Lys82, Arg104, Arg135, His139, Arg143, Lys144 and His146; these residues are clustered, carry positive charges and display similar tertiary structures in the two species (Fig. 7). Of these residues, His2 and Arg104 may be too far away from the pocket to interact directly with IPP (Fig. 7) and His2, Arg135 and Arg143 appear to be variable in avian Hbs as shown in a BLAST search (Altschul et al., 1997); they are not positively charged residues in some other avian Hbs, which indicates the residues at these sites might be not necessary for IPP binding. At physiological pH, the total negative charge on IPP is larger than that on DPG and the total number of positively charged residues in the proposed IPP-binding pocket is also larger than that in the DPG-binding pocket. This might be the reason why the association constants of IPP binding to avian Hbs are larger than that of IPP and DPG binding to human Hb (Rollema & Bauer, 1979; de Bruin et al., 1974). Obviously, the exact location and conformation of the IPP-binding site needs to be determined by the structure of IPP-bound Hb.

comparable to that of the bar-headed goose (P50 of 4.46 kPa for whole blood and 0.263 kPa for Hb; Petschow et al., 1977) and much higher than that of the greylag goose (P50 of 5.20 kPa for whole blood and 0.368 kPa for Hb; Petschow et al., 1977). The black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus, Charadriiformes), which possesses adaptation to high-altitude respiration, has Pro119 and Asn55, which may also lack the van der Waals contact (Godovac-Zimmermann et al., 1988). However, in some avian Hbs, other residues in the 11 interface may also contribute to the increased oxygen af®nity. For example, Ruppell's griffon (Gyps rueppellii, Aegypiinae), which lives in Central Africa and can ¯y up to 11 300 m in altitude, has multiple Hb components, HbA, HbAH , HbD and HbDH, with a gradient of oxygen af®nities (Hiebl et al., 1988). The two major components, HbA and HbAH , have a P50 of 0.39 and 0.27 kPa, respectively. They both have a Pro at 119, an Ile at 55 and an Asp at 125, but differ at position 34 (Thr or Ile). Compared with HbA, which has a hydrogen bond between Thr34 and Asp125, HbAH has a weaker van der Waals contact between Ile34 and Asp125 in the 11 interface, raising its oxygen af®nity. The Canadian goose (Branta canadensis) lives in North America and inhabits lowlying areas and is closely related to the mute swan (Cygnus olor), which lives in Europe and Middle Asia. The oxygen af®nity of the Canadian goose (P50 = 5.6 kPa for whole blood) is slightly lower than that of mute swan (P50 = 5.1 kPa for whole blood; Oberthur, Godovac-Zimmermann et al., 1982); this may also be a consequence of the different residue at 34 (Val or Ile). It was interesting to ®nd that the residues at Pro119, Leu55, Thr34 and Glu125 are the same in chicken HbA, HbD and greylag goose Hbs, but His50 of chicken HbA, which is the same as that of greylag goose Hb, is different from Pro50 of chicken HbD; hence, the Glu125Ð50 salt bridge may also exist in chicken HbA but not in chicken HbD. This is possibly one of the reasons why the oxygen af®nity of chicken HbD is higher than that of chicken HbA (their P50 values are 1.053 and 1.355 kPa for HbD and HbA, respectively; Isaacks et al., 1976). Therefore, the interactions between 125 and other residues in the 11 interface may also affect the oxygen af®nity of Hbs. Residues in the 12 interface have also been suggested to contribute to oxygen af®nity, such as 38 in Ruppell's griffon HbD and HbDH (Hiebl et al., 1988) and chicken HbA and HbD (Knapp et al., 1999). More extensive studies of Hb structures of various species are necessary to ®nd the correlations between amino-acid sequences, tertiary and quaternary structures and functional characteristics such as oxygen Figure 7 af®nity. Potential IPP-binding site in the 12 interface in bar-headed goose aquomet Hb (thick line) In the present study, we also identi®ed a and chicken HbD (thin line). Residues 144±146 in chicken HbD are not shown because of unique quaternary structure for bar-headed missing coordinates. The labelled residues (except His2) are conserved in all bird Hbs. birds have streamlined bodies, a feather covering, developed wings and pneumatic bones. Birds also have special lungs with airsacs which carry out double respiration. These features, common to all birds, cannot explain why some birds can adapt to extreme altitudes, however. On the other hand, at the molecular level, birds living at or migrating across high altitude were found to have Hbs with increased oxygen af®nity. Structural studies of bar-headed goose Hb, therefore, may provide a clue about the molecular mechanism of the increased oxygen af®nity. Here, we show that of the four amino-acid residues that differ between the greylag goose Hb and bar-headed goose Hb, two may be neutral and the other two are located in the 11 interface. Residues Pro119 and Glu125 in greylag goose Hb may interact with Leu55 and His50, respectively, via van der Waals contacts and a salt bridge, whereas in barheaded goose Hb these interactions are absent or weaker, resulting in fewer contacts between the two subunits and increased oxygen af®nity. This appears to support the neutral theory of protein evolution, stating that the majority of mutations in a protein sequence are functionally neutral, but one or a few mutations at the critical functional sites could greatly change the protein function (Kimura, 1979). In other avian Hbs for which the amino-acid sequences are available, the residues at or around 119, 55, 34 and 125 are also correlated with hypoxia survival abilities (Table 3). For example, the Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera, Anatidae), which lives at 6000 m altitude in the highlands of the Andes such as Peru and Bolivia, has a small residue, Ser, at position 55 of its Hb (Hiebl et al., 1987). Its oxygen af®nity (P50 of 3.91 kPa for whole blood; Jessen et al., 1991) is

goose Hb in which the relative positions of the two  dimers in a tetramer molecule differ from that in the typical human R state and the so-called Y state. The crystals were obtained under physiological low-salt conditions, as in the cases of chicken HbD (R state) and carbonmonoxy human Hb and cynomet human Hb (Y state; Smith et al., 1991; Smith & Simmons, 1994), although crystals of human oxy Hb (R state) and the horse aquomet Hb (R state) were obtained under high-salt conditions. Therefore, in disagreement with an earlier proposal (Smith & Simmons, 1994), the salt concentration is unlikely to be a determinant of the unique quaternary structure nor of the Y or R states. The unique quaternary structure is unlikely to be caused by crystal-lattice forces, as structures of human oxy Hb (R state) and horse aquomet Hb (R state) were also determined from crystals with half a tetramer in the asymmetric unit, while structures of chicken HbD (R state) and human Y state were determined from crystals with a full tetramer in the asymmetric. Therefore, we propose that the unique quaternary structure of the goose oxy and aquomet Hbs is correlated with its high oxygen af®nity. We name it the `RH' form, representing high oxygen af®nity. Structural studies of the deoxy Hb and IPP-bound ¯uoromet-Hb of bar-headed goose are in progress, which will certainly reveal more interesting structure±function relationships of the high-af®nity Hbs.
