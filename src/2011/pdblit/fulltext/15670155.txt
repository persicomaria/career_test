2¢-Fluoro-2¢-deoxyuridine 3¢-phosphate (dUFMP) and arabinouridine 3¢-phosphate (araUMP) have non-natural furanose rings. dUFMP and araUMP were prepared by chemical synthesis and found to have three- to sevenfold higher affinity than uridine 3¢-phosphate (3¢-UMP) or 2¢-deoxyuridine 3¢-phosphate (dUMP) for ribonuclease A (RNase A). These differences probably arise (in part) from the phosphoryl groups of 3¢-UMP, dUFMP, and araUMP (pKa ¼ 5.9) being more anionic than that of dUMP (pKa ¼ 6.3). The three-dimensional structures of the crystalline complexes of RNase A with dUMP, dUFMP and araUMP were determined at ° < 1.7 A resolution by X-ray diffraction analysis. In these three structures, the uracil nucleobases and phosphoryl groups bind to the enzyme in a nearly identical position. Unlike 3¢-UMP and dUFMP, dUMP and araUMP bind with their furanose rings in the preferred pucker. In the RNase AÆaraUMP complex, the 2¢-hydroxyl group is exposed to the solvent. All four 3¢-nucleotides bind more tightly to wild-type RNase A than to its T45G variant, which lacks the residue that interacts most closely with the uracil nucleobase. These findings illuminate in atomic detail the interaction of RNase A and 3¢-nucleotides, and indicate that non-natural furanose rings can serve as the basis for more potent inhibitors of catalysis by RNase A.

Ribonucleases catalyse the cleavage of RNA. These enzymes are abundant in living systems, where they play a variety of roles [1,2]. For example, angiogenin is a homologue of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A [3,4]; EC 3.1.27.5) that promotes neovascularization. Angiogenin relies on its ability to cleave RNA for its angiogenic activity [5,6]. An effective inhibitor of the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin could diminish its angiogenic activity, which is an effective means to limit tumor growth [7]. Selective ribonuclease inhibitors could also be useful tools in studying the roles of various ribonucleases in vitro and in vivo [8].

Known nucleotide-based inhibitors of ribonucleases rely on three strategies. Most common are competitive inhibitors that resemble RNA. Shapiro and coworkers have developed especially potent inhibitors of RNase A based on two nucleosides linked by a pyrophosphoryl group [9­11]. Using a different approach, Widlanski and coworkers showed that 3¢-(4-(fluoromethyl)phenyl phosphate)uridine is a mechanism-based inactivator of RNase A [12]. Finally, a new strategy has used an N-hydroxyurea nucleotide to recruit zinc(II), which then chelates to active-site residues of microbial ribonucleases [13,14]. Each of these strategies

Binding of non-natural 3¢-nucleotides to RNase A

is based on nucleotides containing a ribose or deoxyribose ring. Is that choice optimal? Here, we report on the inhibition of a ribonuclease by two 3¢-nucleotides containing non-natural furanose rings: 2¢-fluoro-2¢-deoxyuridine 3¢-phosphate (dUFMP) and arabinouridine 3¢-phosphate (araUMP). We describe efficient syntheses of these non-natural 3¢-nucleotides, determine the pKa value of their phosphoryl groups, and measure their ability to bind to wild-type RNase A and a variant (T45G RNase A) that lacks the residue responsible for nucleobase recognition. We find that both non-natural 3¢-nucleotides have significantly more affinity for wild-type RNase A than do deoxyuridine 3¢-phosphate (dUMP) and uridine 3¢-phosphate (UMP), two 3¢-nucleotides containing natural furanose rings. Finally, we determine the structure of each RNase AÆ3¢-nucleotide complex at high resolution, thereby revealing the basis for the differential inhibition.

Results
Syntheses of 3¢-nucleotides The syntheses of deoxyuridine 3¢-phosphate (dUMP, 5a) and 2¢-fluoro-2¢-deoxyuridine 3¢-phosphate (dUFMP, 5b) were accomplished starting from unprotected nucleosides by the route shown in Scheme 1. A synthesis for dUMP had been reported [15], but involves a phosphorylating agent that is not available commercially. dUFMP had also been synthesized, but its synthesis involves harsh conditions and an involved purification

[16]. The advantages of the route in Scheme 1 include the mild conditions and high yield of the phosphorylation step, the use of commercially available reagents, the facile deprotection of the trityl group, and the high purity of the final product after debenzylation. Briefly, 1 was protected at the 5¢-position by treating it with trityl chloride in dry pyridine at reflux to yield 2 [17]. Subsequent phosphorylation at the 3¢-position was achieved by reacting 2 with diisopropyl dibenzyl phosphoramidite in the presence of 4,5-dicyanoimidazole followed with oxidation with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to yield 3 [18,19]. Deprotection was achieved in two steps, removing the trityl group first in a mixture of dry trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic anhydride, followed by addition of methanol to complete the initial deprotection [20]. The resulting dibenzyl phosphate 4 was deprotected by hydrogenolysis using Pd/C as the catalyst to give dUMP (5a) and dUFMP (5b) in 51 and 47% overall yield, respectively. Arabinouridine 3¢-monophosphate (araUMP, 10) was synthesized from uridine by the route shown in Scheme 2. This is a novel route to araUMP from starting materials that are not only available commercially, but also inexpensive. Two other routes to araUMP have been reported. One starts from a 2¢,3¢-epoxyuridine derivative that is not available commercially [21], and provides a mixture of isomers; the other starts from cytidine 2¢,3¢-cyclic phosphate [22,23], which is expensive. Briefly, uridine was protected at the 5¢-position by treatment with trityl chloride in pyridine, and then reacted with thiocarbonyldiimidazole to give

5¢-trityl-O2,2¢-cyclouridine, 6 [24]. Compound 6 was then phosphorylated at the 3¢-position to provide 7 [18,19]. The protected arabinouridine monophosphate 8 was generated by treatment of 7 with one equivalent of aqueous sodium hydroxide in methanol [25], followed by two-step deprotection (vide supra) to give araUMP (10) in 19% overall yield. Values of pKa The phosphoryl pKa values of 3¢-UMP, dUMP, dUFMP, and araUMP were measured by using 31P NMR spectroscopy, and are listed in Table 1. The pKa values of 3¢-UMP, araUMP, and dUFMP are within error of each other, whereas the pKa value of dUMP is, as expected from a previous report [26], greater than that of the other three. The differences in pKa values likely arise from through-bond inductive effects. No stereoelectronic component is apparent, as the phosphoryl groups of 3¢-UMP and araUMP have the same pKa values.

Values of Ki The values of Ki for the four 3¢-nucleotides were measured by their ability to inhibit the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate 6-FAM-dArU(dA)2-TAMRA by wild-type RNase A and its T45G variant [27], and are listed in Table 1. All four 3¢-nucleotides were potent inhibitors of the wild-type enzyme, whereas inhibition of T45G RNase A was less pronounced--by up to three orders-of-magnitude. The two non-natural nucleotides, dUFMP and araUMP, were the most potent inhibitors of wild-type RNase A. Three-dimensional structures The three-dimensional structures of the complexes of RNase A with dUMP, dUFMP and araUMP were determined at high resolution by using X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1; Table 2). The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org) with accession codes 1W4P, 1W4Q, and 1W4O, respectively. The structure of the RNase AÆ3¢-UMP complex (PDB entry 1O0N) ° was reported previously at a resolution of 1.5 A [28]. The structure of the 3¢-nucleotide bound at the active site was clear in all three complexes (except for molecule B in the araUMP complex, due to severe cracking of those crystals while soaking), as observed from the electron density maps (Fig. 2). Protein atoms in structures of the complexes superimpose well with that of free RNase A (PDB entry 1AFU [29]), with a root mean square deviation near ° 0.52 A. The interactions made in the dUMP, dUFMP, and araUMP complexes are similar

and its ribose adopts a C3-exo, C2-endo, and O4-endo pucker in dUMP, araUMP, and dUFMP, respectively [31] (Table 4). The difference in conformation of the ribose moiety can be attributed to the distinct functional groups and stereochemistry at the C2¢ position (Fig. 3).

Discussion
The results described herein reveal that 3¢-nucleotides with a non-natural furanose ring can have a greater affinity for a ribonuclease than do 3¢-nucleotides with a ribose or deoxyribose ring. The values of Ki for inhibition of catalysis by RNase A increase in the order: dUFMP % araUMP < dUMP < 3¢-UMP (Table 1). The relative affinity of araUMP for wild-type RNase A measured herein is twofold greater than that reported previously [23]. The pKa of the phosphoryl group contributes to this order, as dianionic 3¢-nucleotides are known to be more potent inhibitors of RNase A than monoanionic 3¢-nucleotides [9]. The pKa value of dUMP is 0.4 units greater than that of the other 3¢-nucleotides (Table 1). Likewise, the Ki value of dUMP for RNase A is approximately threefold greater than those of dUFMP and araUMP. 3¢-UMP has less affinity for RNase A than would be expected from its pKa alone. Its weaker binding appears to arise from its 2¢-OH group participating in more unfavourable interactions with the enzyme than do the 2¢ groups of the other 3¢-nucleotides. These unfavourable interactions are probably reinforced by the tight interaction between the uracil base and Thr45 (vide infra), and result in the distortion of its ribose ring. The furanose rings of unbound 3¢-UMP and dUFMP reside predominantly in the C3-endo (N) conformation (Fig. 3) [16,32]. Yet in the RNase Æ3¢-UMP complex, the ribose ring is in

the C2-endo (S) conformation [28]. Similarly, the furanose ring of dUFMP in the RNase AÆdUFMP complex is in the O4-endo conformation. In contrast, the furanose rings of dUMP and araUMP are not required to take on an unfavourable pucker upon binding to RNase A, as both reside in the C2¢-endo conformation in the complex and free in solution [33­35]. These two 3¢-nucleotides have hydrogen in place of the 2¢-OH and -F of 3¢-UMP and dUFMP, which could minimize steric conflicts with active-site residues. It is noteworthy that the relative weak affinity of 3¢-UMP supports the hypothesis that ground-state destabilization contributes to the catalytic prowess of RNase A [36].

(Fig. 4). In contrast, the 2¢-H and -F of dUMP and dUFMP can form only weak hydrogen bonds with water [37], and the 2¢-OH of araUMP is oriented away from the active-site residues and need not be desolvated upon binding to RNase A (Fig. 4). All four 3¢-nucleotides bind more weakly to T45G RNase A than to the wild-type enzyme. This decrease in affinity underlines the importance of the interaction between Thr45 and pyrimidine nucleobases in substrate binding [36,38,39]. Moreover, the relative affinity of the 3¢-nucleotides for T45G RNase A follows a much different trend, with the Ki values increasing in the order: < (Table 1). 3¢-UMP < dUFMP < araUMP,dUMP The affinity of the 3¢-nucleotides for T45G RNase A appears to be sensitive to the pucker of the furanose ring: 3¢-UMP and dUFMP, which prefer the C3-endo conformation [16,32], bind more tightly than do dUMP and araUMP, which prefer the C2-endo conformation [33­35]. Without the presence of Thr45 as an anchor, a 3¢-nucleotide can orient its furanose ring and phosphoryl group so as to optimize favourable contacts with active-site residues. For example, 3¢-UMP could form a hydrogen bond between its 2¢-OH and an active-site residue in T45G RNase A instead of being subjected to the steric constraints that impose an unfavourable ring pucker upon binding to the wild-type enzyme. Such a hydrogen bond could be the source of the twofold higher affinity of T45G RNase A for 3¢-UMP than dUFMP. Two anchor points appear to dominate the protein­ nucleic acid interactions studied herein. The uracil ring and phosphoryl group of dUMP, dUFMP, and araUMP bind similarly to wild-type RNase A (Table 1; Figs 1 and 4), despite large differences in furanose ring

pucker (Fig. 3B). For example, the two most effective inhibitors of catalysis by wild-type RNase A, dUFMP and araUMP, prefer different puckers in solution but have indistinguishable Ki values. The absence of one of these anchor points in the T45G variant leads to a much broader range in affinity (Table 1). New applications have emerged for arabinonucleosides. For example, Dharma and coworkers have demonstrated that arabinonucleotides are effective antisense agents [40]. In addition, the antineoplastic drug fludarabine is an arabinonucleoside, and the antineoplastic drug clofarabine is a 2¢-fluoro-2¢-deoxyarabinonucleoside. We find that araUMP (as well as dUFMP) binds more tightly to RNase A than do analogous natural 3¢-nucleotides. Hence, we put forth araUMP (and dUFMP) for consideration in the creation of new high-affinity ligands for RNase A and its homologues.

Experimental procedures
General
Reagents obtained from commercial sources were used without further purification. Wild-type RNase A and its T45G variant were prepared by procedures reported previously [38,39,41]. 3¢-UMP was obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). dUMP (5a) and dUFMP (5b) were synthesized by the route shown in Scheme 1; araUMP (10) was synthesized by the route shown in Scheme 2 (vide infra). Dry dichloromethane was drawn from a Cycletainer from Mallinckrodt Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). TLC was performed using aluminum-backed plates coated with silica gel

Dicyanoimidazole (127 mg, 1.08 mmol) was suspended in dry dichloromethane (25 mL) in an oven-dried 100-mL round-bottomed flask containing a stir bar. Diisopropyldibenzylphosphoramidite (220 lL, 0.98 mmol) was added to the suspension at room temperature, and the mixture was allowed to stir for 01.25 h. 5¢-Trityl-2¢-deoxyuridine (175 mg, 0.37 mmol) suspended in dry CH2Cl2 (10 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for an additional 01.25 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0 °C, and solid m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (351 mg) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 15 min, the ice bath was removed, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for an additional 1 h.

Determination of phosphoryl-group pKa values
The pKa of the phosphoryl group of each 3¢-nucleotide was determined by using 31P NMR spectroscopy. A 3¢-nucleotide was dissolved in D2O (1.0 mL) to make a 100 mm stock solution. An aliquot (100 lL) of the stock solution was added to 0.10 m buffer (900 lL), and the resulting solution was filtered. The buffers used were oxalic acid (pKa ¼ 1.3), citric acid (3.1 and 4.8), succinic acid (4.2), Mes (6.15), Mops (7.2), Tris (8.3), CHES (9.5), and CAPS (10.4), each adjusted to a pH near its pKa with 2 m HCl or 2 m NaOH. A filtered sample (900 lL) was placed in an NMR tube, and its 31P NMR chemical shift was measured with a Bruker DMX-400 MHz (wide bore) spectrometer equipped with a quattro-nucleus probe or a Bruker DMX-500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a broadband probe, referenced to an external standard of H3PO4, and 1H-decoupled. The pH of each sample was measured with a Beckman W40 pH meter.

In Eqn (2) (DF/Dt)0 is the ribonucleolytic activity prior to the addition of the 3¢-nucleotide. During the assays, the fluorescence intensity was quenched at high concentrations of 3¢-nucleotide. To correct for this quenching, the following assay was conducted. To 2.0 mL of 20 mm Mes­NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (50 mm) was added 1 lL of the substrate 6-FAM­dArU(dA)2)6-TAMRA (60 lm), followed 3 min later by 2 lL of a concentrated solution of wild-type RNase A (1.5 mm). At 3-min intervals thereafter, aliquots (5, 10, 20, and 40 lL) of a dilute solution of araUMP (1.72 mm) were added to the same cuvette, and the fluorescence intensity was measured. In a separate assay, aliquots (5, 10, 20, and 40 lL) of a concentrated solution of araUMP (25.7 mm) were added, and the fluorescence intensity was measured. The two data sets were corrected for loss of fluorescence intensity due to dilution, and then combined and fitted to Eqn (3) using deltagraph 4.0. A quenching correction factor for each point was calculated using Eqn (3) (where F1 is the value of the final fluorescence intensity measurement and k ¼ )30.77) and the 3¢-nucleotide concentration in the cuvette. Each value of DF/Dt was divided by the correction factor to give the corrected value. The correction factor was the same for all the 3¢-nucleotides, assuming that the fluorescence quenching arises from the uracil moiety of the 3¢-nucleotide. y ¼ ð1 À F1 Þekx þ F1 ð3Þ

Determination of Ki values
The Ki value for each 3¢-nucleotide was determined from its ability to inhibit the cleavage of 6-FAM-dArU(dA)26-TAMRA by RNase A [27]. Fluorescence emission intensity was measured at 515 nm, with excitation at 493 nm. Each assay was carried out in 2.0 mL of 20 mm Mes/ NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (50 mm), RNase A (wild-type, 0.5 pm; T45G, 12.5 pm), and 6-FAM-dArU(dA)2-6-TAMRA (0.06 lm). The value of DF/Dt was measured for 3 min after the addition of RNase A. An aliquot (0.5 lL) of a dilute solution of 3¢-nucleotide (2 mm) dissolved in water was added, and DF/Dt was measured for 3 min in the presence of the 3¢-nucleotide. Additional aliquots of 3¢-nucleotide were added at 3-min intervals, doubling the volume of the aliquot with each addition until an 8-lL aliquot had been added. Then, an aliquot (4 lL) of a

X-ray crystallography
Crystals of RNase A (Sigma Chemical) were grown using the vapour diffusion technique as described previously [29]; they belong to the space group C2, with two molecules per asymmetric unit. Crystals of the 3¢-nucleotide complexes were obtained by soaking the RNase A crystals in 20 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing PEG 4000 (25% w/v) and dUMP (50 mm), araUMP (1 mm), or dUFMP (12.5 mm) for 45, 60, and 75 min, respectively, prior to data collection. Diffraction data for the three complexes were collected at 100 K (the reservoir buffer with 30% PEG 4000 was used as cryoprotectant) on stations PX 14.1 and

PX 9.6 from a single crystal at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK) using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. All diffraction images were integrated using HKL2000 [42]. Phases were obtained by using the structure of free RNase A [29] as a starting model. The refinement was carried out with the CNS suite [43] and the model building was carried out with O [44]. Initial model building and refinement was carried out without the 3¢-nucleotide. In each data set, a set of reflections were kept aside for the calculation of Rfree [45]. The 3¢-nucleotide and water molecules were modelled using the 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc SIGMAA weighted maps. The topology and parameter files for the 3¢-nucleotides were either generated manually and/or using the Hic-up server [46] http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/hicup/. All three structures have good geometry, and the / and w angles of > 87% of the protein residues are in the most favorable region of a Ramachandran plot. All structural diagrams were prepared with the program bobscript [47].
