Author contributions: AC and MWK devised and initiated the project and, together with RTYC, undertook fieldwork, sample collection and initial protein characterization. RTYC did the sample purification, analysis and de novo sequencing together with CB (Glasgow) and CHB (St. Andrews). AAL provided laboratory facilities and assisted with fieldwork arrangements in Malaysia. Protein crystallography was done by MO, MFW, LGC, KAJ, HL, SAM, MAW and JHN. AC & JHN did the chemistry. AC, JHN and MO wrote the manuscript, in consultation with other authors.

Etymology: The name "ranasmurfin" derives from the latin rana (frog) and the popular blue cartoon characters (the Smurfs). The specific shorthand designation, Pl-RSF-1, comes from Polypedates leucomystax ranasmurfin; this being the 1st example of a potentially larger family of similar proteins.

Experimental Section: Protein isolation and characterization: P. leucomystax nests were collected from well populated sites along the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia with appropriate permits from the Malaysian Department of Wildlife and National Parks and Economic Planning Unit (EPU). Foam material was immediately separated from eggs by hand and stored frozen until use. Ranasmurfin is the dominant protein in the nest and was isolated from this mixture by gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex-75) after dispersal of the foam into water by gentle sonication. The protein runs as two bands, one a ca.13 kDa monomer that is weakly coloured, and a second a much stronger blue band corresponding to a ca.26 kDa dimer. We have given the systematic abbreviation Pl-RSF-1 to this protein, to designate its origin: Polypedates leucomystax ranasmurfin. The blue fraction was concentrated by centrifugal concentration prior to crystallization trials. UV/vis absorbance/fluorescence spectra were recorded using a TEC BioMate-5 or NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer, and a Spex FluoroMax spectrofluorimeter, as appropriate. An excitation wavelength of 295nm was used for protein fluorescence emission in order to avoid tyrosine interference. Samples were dispersed either in water or, for pH-sensitive investigations, in 0.1 M Na phosphate buffers. Protein concentrations were estimated using standard dye-binding assay,[1] calibrated with serum albumin. Metal ion content was assayed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; Perkin Elmer) on liquid samples acidified with nitric acid (5%). Reagents, including sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, Na ascorbate, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), dithiothreitol (DTT), ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), hydroxylamine-HCl, indophenol (phenolindophenol; 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)iminocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-on), -, -, and hydroxyethyl-cyclodextrins (all from Sigma-Aldrich), and standard buffer components (Sigma-Aldrich, BDH, Fisher Scientific), were used without further purification, with the exception of NBS, which was recrystallized from hot water immediately before use. All buffers used in protein production have less than 0.0005% Zn2+ as a contaminant. Indophenol is insoluble in water, but was solubilized by stirring overnight at room temperature in dilute (10 mM) aqueous solutions of cyclodextrins (-, -, or hydroxyethyl--) and centrifugation to remove undissolved material, presumably forming host:guest complexes characteristic of the cyclodextrin family (Fig. S6).[2, 3].Chemical reactivity of P1-RSF-1 and indophenol:cyclodextrin model compound was investigated by addition of the following reagents, with incubation overnight at room temperature where required: NBS (0.25 mM), DTT (12.5 mM), EDTA (12.5 mM), NaBH4 (up to 0.1 M), NaBH3CN (50 mM), ascorbate (10 mM), hydroxylamine (up to 0.1 M). Protein crystallography: The crystallization of the protein has already been described,[4] and details may be found in this preliminary crystallization report. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in SI Table 1, and the structure was solved using the Zn2+ anomalous signal.[4] The initial map was clear and

the structure built by hand using COOT.[5] The structure was refined using REFMAC5,[6] and links added as they became clear in density. The process of assigning sequence was done by visual inspection and was iterative with mass spectrometry. We identified two unexplained areas of electron density, adjacent to Ser9 and the Cys17-Cys65 disulfide in the B chain. The difference density is consistent with a light atom and we modeled these as an oxidized Ser and an oxygenated Cys. For Ser9 the geometry of the density is consistent with a carboxylic acid (180°), not two positions of the O atom (120°), though this is not a definitive assignment. For Cys65, the anomalous Fourier shows no additional density that can be interpreted as a disordered sulfur atom. Experimental structure and phases have been deposited with code 2VH3. Mass spectrometry/de novo sequencing: Purified Pl-RSF-1, reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide, was subjected to trypsin digestion (TPCK modified, Princeton Separations, Inc., USA) following standard procedures. Tryptic peptide fractions were separated using an UltiMate nanoLC (LC Packings, Amsterdam) equipped with a PepMap C18 trap & column, using a 30 min gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration, containing 0.1 % formic acid (5-35% acetonitrile in 18 min, 35-50% in a further 7 min, followed by 95% acetonitrile to clean the column). The eluent was analysed using a Q-Star Pulsar XL tandem mass spectrometer or ABI 4700 MALDI TOF-TOF (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and data processed in Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) mode. Alternatively, MS/MS spectra were sequenced manually using Applied Biosystems BioAnalyst software. Once a protein sequence based upon the crystallographic electron density had been generated, the MS/MS data for doubly and triply charged precursor ions were also searched using the Applied Biosystems ProteinPilot Paragon algorithm. Similar procedures were followed using chyomotrypsin and lysine-C (TPCK modified, Princeton Separations, Inc., USA) to generate additional peptide fragments for sequence confirmation. Molecular masses of intact protein samples were analysed by MALDI-TOF using CHCA (-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid) or SA (sinnapic acid) matrices.

SI Figure S9: Progressive loss of long-wavelength absorbance bands in purified Pl-RSF-1 upon EDTA treatment, incubated at room temperature in 12.5mM EDTA, 20mM HEPES, pH 7, with 12.5mM DTT. (A similar loss of blue chromophore bands is seen in the absence of DTT, but is much slower.) The color is not recovered upon addition of Zn2+, probably because of irreversible loss of protein tertiary structure incurred by disruption of stabilising crosslinks.
