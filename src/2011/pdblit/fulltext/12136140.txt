Structures of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complexed with coenzyme analogues
Crystal structures of GAPDH from Palinurus versicolor complexed with two coenzyme analogues, SNAD+ and ADP-ribose, were determined by molecular replacement and re®ned at medium resolution to acceptable crystallographic factors and reasonable stereochemistry. ADP-ribose in the ADP-ribose±GAPDH complex adopts a rather extended conformation. The interactions between ADPribose and GAPDH are extensive and in a fashion dissimilar to the coenzyme NAD+. This accounts for the strong inhibiting ability of ADP-ribose. The conformational changes induced by ADP-ribose binding are quite different to those induced by NAD+ binding. This presumably explains the non-cooperative behaviour of the ADP-ribose binding. Unexpectedly, the SNAD+±GAPDH complex reveals pairwise asymmetry. The asymmetry is signi®cant, including the SNAD+ molecule, active-site structure and domain motion induced by the coenzyme analogue. In the yellow or red subunits [nomenclature of subunits is as in Buehner et al. (1974). J. Mol. Biol. 90, 25±49], SNAD+ binds similarly, as does NAD+ in holoGAPDH. While, in the green or blue subunit, the SNAD+ binds in a non-productive manner, resulting in a disordered thionicotinamide ring and rearranged active-site residues. The conformation seen in the yellow and red subunits of SNAD+± GAPDH is likely to represent the functional state of the enzyme complex in solution and thus accounts for the substrate activity of SNAD+. A novel type of domain motion is observed for the binding of the coenzyme analogues to GAPDH. The possible conformational transitions involved in the coenzyme binding and the important role of the nicotinamide group are discussed.

1. Introduction
The glycolytic d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12) is a tetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative phosphorylation of d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to form 1,3-diphosphoglycerate in the presence of NAD+ and inorganic phosphate (Harris & Waters, 1976). The enzyme shows various cooperative properties for binding coenzyme depending on its sources and `half of the sites' properties, when the SH group of the active-site Cys149 reacts with certain alkylating and acylating reagents (MacQuarrie & Bernhard, 1971; Levitzki, 1974; Ho & Tsou, 1979). Several models have been proposed to explain this cooperative phenomenon (Monod et al., 1965; Bernhard & MacQuarrie, 1973; Koshland et al., 1966). A number of crystal structures have been solved for GAPDHs. They include those from many mesophilic organisms such as lobsters (Buehner et al., 1974; Moras et al., 1975; Song et al., 1998, 1999; Shen, Li et al., 2000), Leishmania

mexicana (Kim et al., 1995), Escherichia coli (Duee et al., 1996), from thermophilic eubacteria such as Bacillus stearothermophilus (Skarzynski et al., 1987; Skarzynski & Wonacott, 1988; Didierjean et al., 1997), Thermotoga maritima (Korndorfer et al., 1995), Thermus aquaticus (Tanner et al., 1996) and from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (Isupov et al., 1999). The active-site structure and the NAD+-induced conformational changes have been observed and the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme has been proposed (Moras et al., 1975; Skarzynski et al., 1987; Song et al., 1999; Duee et al., 1996; Yun et al., 2000). All high-resolution structures of apo- and holo-GAPDH from different sources show good 222 symmetry and tend to support the induced-®t model of the cooperativity. Several NAD+ analogues have been tested for their enzymatic properties and cooperativity in reactions with rabbit GAPDH (Eby & Kirtley, 1971; Wallen & Branlant, 1983). Two coenzyme analogues, SNAD+ and ADP-ribose, can bind strongly to GAPDH. SNAD+ is effective as a substrate to replace NAD+, and ADP-ribose is a potent competitive inhibitor. They show non-cooperative binding under certain experimental conditions (Eby & Kirtley, 1971; Henis & Levitzki, 1980). In this paper, structures of GAPDH from Palinurus versicolor complexed with these two coenzyme analogues (SNAD+±GAPDH and ADPR±GAPDH) are reported and the correlation of these structures with their activity, inhibition and cooperativity are discussed. Unexpectedly, in the SNAD+±GAPDH structure Q-axis related subunits remain symmetrical; however, R-axis or P-axis related subunits reveal signi®cant asymmetry. The possible reasons for the asymmetry are discussed. The enzyme complexes referred to are from the P. versicolor enzyme unless otherwise speci®ed. The nomenclature of subunits (green, red, blue, yellow) and the de®nition of molecular axes (P, Q, R) are the same as those in the Homarus americanus GAPDH structure (Buehner et al., 1974). The relationship of the red, green, yellow and blue subunits with the P, Q and R molecular twofold axes is shown in Fig. 6 of this paper. The nomenclature of atoms for NAD+ analogues is same as those for the NAD+ molecule with slight modi®cations: in SNAD+, NO73NS7; in ADPribose, NN13NO1* (Skarzynski et al., 1987).

The crystals of the GAPDH complexes were grown from an equilibrium mixture containing apo-enzyme and the coenzyme analogues as described earlier (Shen, Wang et al., 2000). The crystals of both GAPDH complexes belonged to the same space group C2 as holo- or apo-GAPDHs, but with different unit-cell parameters. The asymmetric unit for each of the complex crystals contained one tetramer (four subunits). The data were recorded at 291 K using the MAR Research image Ê Ê plate 345 system to 2.8 A for SNAD+±GAPDH and to 3.0 A for ADPR±GAPDH.

(PV holo-GAPDH) used for molecular replacement and the subsequent rigid-body re®nement was symmetrical, consisting The SNAD+±GAPDH structure was solved by the of four identical subunits. Therefore, Q-axis dimer NCS molecular-replacement method (Rossmann & Blow, 1962) restraints, i.e. NCS restraints between the green and blue with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using PV holosubunits, and between the yellow and red subunits, were GAPDH (PDB code 1szj) as a search model, which is highly applied [the positional weight constant and ' for the homologous to GAPDH from H. americanus (sequence Ê Ê B factor are 300 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 and 6.0 A2, respectively identity of 96.4%). The search model consists of the dimer of Ê Ê (1 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 = 4.184 kJ molÀ1 AÀ2)] in the following PV holo-GAPDH made up of the green subunit and its annealing re®nement, minimization and individual B-factor crystallographic twofold-symmetry-related blue subunit re®nement in order to increase the data-to-parameter ratio.

Two prominent solutions were found for the cross-rotation function with correlation coef®cients of 29.5 and 29.4, respectively, for data in the resolution Ê range 8±4 A (compared with a correlation coef®cient of 7.5 for the maximum noise peak). The translation function calculation then yielded two unambiguous solutions with correlation coef®cients of 32.5 and 31.3, respectively. The rigid-body ®tting resulted in a correlation coef®cient of 67.2 and an R factor of È 0.34. The program CNS (Brunger, et al., 1998) was used to re®ne this model. Firstly, 40 rounds of rigid-body re®nements carried out in the data range 30± Ê 3.0 A without non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints. The Fo À Fc electron-density maps revealed unambiguously the whole SNAD+ molecule in the NAD+-binding site in the yellow and red subunits and only ADP-ribose portion of SNAD+ in the green and blue subunits (Figs. 1b and 1c). The calculation of SNAD+-induced rotation of NAD+-binding domain relative to the catalytic domain also indicated signi®cant difference between R-axis-related subunits or between P-axis-related subunits.

Ê The data range 30±2.8 A without cutoff was used in the re®nement. In the simulated-annealing procedure, the system was heated to 5000 K and slowly cooled to 300 K in 25 K steps. Based on the 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron-density maps, the SNAD+ molecules, sulfate ions and water molecules were added and the model was further adjusted. 120 rounds of positional re®nement and individual B-factor re®nement were then repeated until the Rfree factor converged. Manual rebuilding with the graphics program TURBOFRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1989) was used when necessary. The ®nal model has an R factor of 0.169 and an Rfree of 0.205. We have also tried other re®nement strategies, including those of 222 NCS restraints, P-axis dimer NCS restraints, R-axis dimer NCS restraints and ignoring NCS; however, all these re®nements resulted in models with higher Rfree factors (above 0.25). The structural determination and re®nement of ADPR±GAPDH were carried out in a similar way to those for SNAD+±GAPDH. After rigidbody re®nement without NCS restraints, the tetramer of ADPR±GAPDH still kept good 222 symmetry. The calculated Fo À Fc electrondensity map clearly showed the ADP-ribose molecules in the NAD+-binding sites and the similarity of their conformations in all subunits (Fig. 1a). On the basis of this, NCS restraints were applied to each subunit (the positional weight constant and ' for the B factor are Ê Ê 300 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 and 10 A2, respectively). The Ê data range 30±3.0 A without cutoff was used in the re®nement. The ®nal model has an R factor of 0.167 and Rfree factor of 0.196. The re®nement results of both structures are listed in Table 1. The structure determination showed that the SNAD+ and ADP-ribose molecules lying in the NAD+-binding pocket had well de®ned electron density except the two thionicotinamide groups of SNAD+ in the green and blue subunits, which were not included in the Figure 3 The comparison of NAD+-binding pocket structure of apo-GAPDH (grey) with model.

Fig. 3(a) using the superposition based on the NAD+-binding domain. Residues forming the ADP-ribose binding pocket show different conformational changes from those observed in the comparison of apo- and holo-GAPDH. In the adenosine-binding site, the side chains of Pro33 and Phe34 are shifted outward away from the active site Ê about 1.0 A and the segment 71±79 is also shifted outward signi®cantly, leading to the increased distance between Met77 O and the ADPR AN6 atom; in the binding site of the second ribose, residue Thr179 moves slightly to avoid close contact with the second ribose. As a result of these movements, ADPR±GAPDH has a slightly more open coenzyme-binding pocket than that in apo-GAPDH.
3.2. SNAD+ binding

Figure 3 (continued)

the second ribose has to adopt a different conformation so that it is enclosed tightly between the phosphate and the nicotinamide group to avoid the collision between the group and residue Glu314. The distance between the NC2* atom and Ê the AC6 atom in ADP-ribose is 16.15 A, whereas the correÊ sponding value is 12.85 A in NAD+ of holo-GAPDH. The torsion angles for ADP-ribose are listed in Table 2. The substantial difference of second ribose conformation comes from the changes in the torsion angles $n, PAÐO3ÐPNÐ NO5*, which are À137.08, 154.90 and 102 for holo-GAPDH, ADPR±GAPDH and ADPR±ADH, respectively. This indicates that the pyrophosphate bridge can adopt different geometry depending on the species of the coenzyme analogue and of the enzyme. ADP-ribose forms a number of polar and hydrophobic interactions with the protein. The hydrogen bonds between the NAD+ analogue and protein are listed in Table 3. Like the binding mode of the adenosine in holo-GAPDH, the adenine ring forms stable hydrophobic interactions with surrounding residues Pro33, Phe34, Phe99 and Val98, and the adenosine ribose forms hydrophobic interactions with neighbouring residues Phe8, Ile35 and Phe34 and two hydrogen bonds to the side-chain O atoms of Asp32. Signi®cant differences in binding mode occur in the region from the pyrophosphate to the second ribose. This corresponds to the substantial conformational differences between ADP-ribose and NAD+ there. In ADPR±GAPDH, the NO1* and NO2* atoms of the second ribose form two additional hydrogen bonds with the main-chain N atom of Ala180 in the S-loop from the catalytic domain. In holo-GAPDH, no direct hydrogen bonds are formed between NAD+ and the catalytic domain. The structural comparison of ADPR±GAPDH with apoGAPDH around the coenzyme binding pocket is shown in

In the yellow or red subunit, the overall conformation of SNAD+ in SNAD+±-GAPDH is similar to NAD+ in holo-GAPDH. The superposition of both the coenzyme and the coenzyme analogue gives an Ê r.m.s.d. value of 0.3 A only. The substitution of an S atom for an O atom does not have any effect on the general conformation of the nicotinamide group. The planes of the thiocarboxyamide group and the pyridinum ring are inclined at an angle of about 22 , a value close to the corresponding value in the nicotinamide group of holo-GAPDH (Song et al., 1998). The interactions between SNAD+ and the enzyme are also similar to those between NAD+ and the enzyme (Table 3). In the adenine-binding site, SNAD+ is stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding residues. However, the hydrogen bond, NAD+ N6AÁ Á ÁO Arg77 observed in holo-GAPDH does not Ê exist (3.45 A), indicating a lesser importance of this hydrogen bond in the binding of SNAD+. Like holo-GAPDH, hydrogen bonds are also found in the Asp32 binding site and the pyrophosphate site. The thionicotinamide-ribose does not make any hydrogen bonds to the protein atoms and only has van der Waals contacts with residues Ile11, Ser95, Gly97, Ser119 and Ala120. The bulky thionicotinamide ring has hydrophobic interactions with Ile11 and Tyr317, forcing a change of the side-chain torsion angles of Ile11. Similar results were also observed in the comparison of apo- and holoGAPDH from PV and BS (Shen, Li et al., 2000; Skarzynski & Wonacott, 1988). An interesting point is that the carboxamide sulfur NS7 of the thionicotinamide ring can make a weak Ê hydrogen bond with the protein atom Asn313 ND2 (3.24 A). + A similar hydrogen bond, NAD NO7Á Á Á ND2 Asn313, in holo-GAPDH has signi®cant importance for productive binding of NAD+. This interaction was proposed to be an essential structural factor in ®xing the nicotinamide ring in the syn orientation (Skarzynski et al., 1987; Duee et al., 1996). An NHÁ Á ÁS hydrogen bond was reported to exist in thioNADP+± DHFR (McTigue et al., 1993). In the green and blue subunits, the overall conformation of the ADP-ribose portion of SNAD+ is also similar to the

corresponding portion of NAD+ in holo-GAPDH but, unexpectedly, the thionicotinamide ring of SNAD+ is disordered and the active-site residues are restructured. Compared with the yellow and red subunits, the side chain of the active-site Cys149 rotates about 90 and residues Glu314 and Arg10 are Ê displaced about 1.5 A toward Cys149. The movement of these two residues leads to the breakage of the hydrogen bond Arg10 NH1Á Á ÁOD2 Asp47 in the conserved double salt-bridge network, Asp47±Arg10±Glu314 (Fig. 4). The large rotation of Cys149 shows that Cys149 is not activated by His176 and is not correctly located to attack the aldehydic function of the

substrate. Therefore, SNAD+ is bound in a non-productive manner on these two subunits. The structural comparisons of SNAD+±GAPDH with apoGAPDH around the coenzyme-binding pocket are shown in Fig. 3(b) for the green subunit and in Fig. 3(c) for the yellow subunit using the same superposition described above. For the yellow or red subunit of SNAD+±GAPDH, most of residues in contact with SNAD+ show conformational changes similar to those found in the comparison of apo- and holo-GAPDH, but to a lesser extent. However, for the green or blue subunit of SNAD+±GAPDH, conformational changes of these residues are similar to those found in the apo-GAPDH and ADPR± GAPDH but to a greater extent. The changes in the latter two subunits involve almost the entire NAD+-binding domain including the long C-terminal helix. Residues Pro33 and Phe34 Ê have a movement of 1.2 A toward Cys149 with an accompanying 90 rotation of the Phe34 side chain in the yellow or Ê red subunits, while moving 1.3 A away from Cys149 in the Ê green or blue subunit. Segment 74±83 has an average 1.0 A shift toward Cys149 in the yellow or red subunit, while the Ê shift is 1.5 A away from Cys149 in the green or blue subunit. Thus, the green or blue subunit has an open NAD+-binding pocket, while the yellow or red subunit is closed.
3.3. Domain motion

The conformational changes induced by NAD+ can be described approximately as an overall relative rotation of the 3.16 two domains accompanying the translation movement of some 3.15 structural elements. The NAD+-binding domain rotates about 2.67 2.92 4 relative to the catalytic domain for BS GAPDH (Skarzynski 3.17 & Wonacott, 1988) and 3 for PV GAPDH (Shen, Li et al., 2.92 2000). In order to study the domain rotation in the two 3.24 GAPDH complexes, the green subunit was chosen for ADPR± 2.67 GAPDH and both the green and yellow subunits were chosen 2.75 for SNAD+±GAPDH (see Fig. 5). The NAD+-binding domain 3.11 3.30 of ADPR±GAPDH is rotated about 2 relative to the catalytic 2.84 domain compared with apo-GAPDH. The rotation axis is 2.88 located at 9 = 82, 2 = 51 and 1 = 358 , which differ signi®cantly from 9 = 130, 2 = 140 and 1 = 357 based on the apo-holo transition. The corresponding rotation for SNAD+± GAPDH can be divided into two classes. For the yellow or red subunit it is about 1.5 with a rotation axis located at 9 = 130, 2 = 97 and 1 = 358.5 , which is close to that calculated for the apoholo transition. Unexpectedly, for the green or blue subunit it is about 3 with a rotation axis located at 9 = 85, 2 = 36 and 1 = 357 , which is close to that calculated for the transition from apoto ADPR±GAPDH. Therefore, SNAD+±GAPDH shows a `hybrid'-type Figure 4 domain rotation. This leads to R and P The conformations of ADP-ribose (green) and NAD+ (purple) in GAPDH. As a comparison, the + axis asymmetry in the tetramer of conformations of ADP-ribose (yellow) and NAD (red) in ADH (pdb codes: 5adh and 6adh, Eklund et al., 1984) are also included.

3.4. Intersubunit interface

The binding of ADP-ribose and SNAD+ to GAPDH does not signi®cantly affect the subunit interfaces of the tetramer. Hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds within the interfaces for SNAD+±GAPDH are listed in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, the intersubunit interactions at P and R interfaces are basically the same as those in holoGAPDH. The hydrogen-bonding interactions (a total of only four) at the Q interface are also similar to holo-GAPDH, the only change being the hydrogen bond Asp277 OÁ Á ÁOEH Tyr42, which is shorÊ tened about 0.3 A compared with holoGAPDH owing to the changes in the NAD+-binding domain. Since the symmetry of the SNAD+±GAPDH tetramer is somewhat distorted, the symmetry at its subunit interfaces is unexpected. The symmetry of intersubunit interactions re¯ects less the conformational changes induced by the SNAD+ in the -sheet structure of the catalytic domain and the segment 39±49 of the NAD+-binding domain, which participate in the intersubunit interactions.

As shown in Table 1, axes b and c of C2 (II) are approximately equal to the b and a of C2 (I), respectively; however, a of C2 (II) has twice the length of c in C2 (I). These results suggest that the molecules in C2 (II) may pack with a double-layered c face-centred array of C2 (I) along a of C2 (II). The structure analysis con®rms this. Fig. 7 illustrates the relationship between the two crystal forms. The unit cell of C2 (II) can be simply considered as consisting of two consecutive unit cells of C2 (I) along its c axis. However, unlike C2 (I) where the molecular Q axis coincides with crystallographic b axis, in C2 (II) the molecular Q axis is parallel to the plane ab and deviates from the crystallographic b axis about 4.5 . In C2 (II), the Q axis is located at 3 = 90, 9 = À85.5, 2 = 180 ; the P axis at 3 = 24, 9 = À175.5, 2 = 180 and the R axis at 3 = 66, 9 = 5, 2 = 180 (LSQAB from the CCP4 program package; Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). From the analysis of the relationship between the two crystal forms, it can be

inferred that the molecular contacts in the crystal form of GAPDH complexed with the coenzyme analogues are basically similar to that of coenzyme free or saturated GAPDH. For the GAPDH tetramer, the NAD+-binding domain usually contributes to the principal tetramer packing as it is located around the periphery of the molecule. In C2 (II) crystals, the four NAD+-binding domains have different crystallographic environments. The NAD+-binding domains for the green and blue subunits have multi-point contact regions. The NAD+binding domain for the red subunit is in contact with only one neighbouring tetramer in one region, involving residue Glu135, which is located at the waist of the subunit. The NAD+-binding domain for the yellow subunit is in contact with two neighbouring tetramers in a similar region around Glu135 and one additional region involving Phe109. Thus, the NAD+-binding domains appear ¯exible to a certain degree in the yellow and red subunits owing to lesser lattice restriction in comparison with the green and blue subunits, as shown by their higher average B factors (see Table 1). This packing feature is similar to that in C2 (I) crystals.

4. Discussion

ADP and AMP at high concentration (10À3 to 10À2 mol lÀ1) did not break the BS apo-GAPDH crystal but ADP-ribose did even at the lower concentration of 10À5 to 10À4 M (Biesecher et al., 1977). Recently, it was observed, based on the studies of ¯uorescent changes of Trp84 and Trp310, that signi®cant conformational changes occur in the binding of ADP-ribose to BS apo-GAPDH, while only small conformational changes are generated by AMP or ADP binding (Gabellieri et al., 1996). The crystallographic studies reported here show the details of Asp277 O 2.55 the interactions between ADP-ribose and apo-GAPDH and Tyr42 OH 2.60 the ADP-ribose-induced conformational changes. Such Asp276 OD1 2.45 conformational changes, including domain motion, are Tyr46 OH 2.48 distinctive and are quite different from those of NAD+binding. This study indicates that the ADPribose moiety alone is insuf®cient to induce complete NAD+-induced conformational changes and generate the closed state of the subunit because of the lack of a nicotinamide group (in fact, it adopts a slightly more open state than apo-GAPDH). NAD+-induced conformational changes are intimately connected to the cooperativity of GAPDH. The distinctive conformational changes observed in binding of ADP-ribose to GAPDH may be related to its non-cooperative behavior. The ADPribose is a potent inhibitor which is competitive with NAD+ for GAPDH. It can be seen from Table 3 that there are Figure 6 nine hydrogen bonds between ADP-ribose The comparison of subunit structure of holo-GAPDH (black) with SNAD+±GAPDH and the protein compared with eight complexes (green subunit in green, blue subunit in blue, red subunit in red and yellow subunit hydrogen bonds between NAD+ and the in yellow) using the superposition matrix of the catalytic domains.

ADP-ribose (Ki = 0.18 mM) can thus be explained by its tight binding to GAPDH. It is unexpected that SNAD+±GAPDH shows signi®cant structural asymmetry. The thionicotinamide groups of SNAD+ molecules are disordered in half of the subunits (green and blue). The disorder of the thionicotinamide groups observed should not be a consequence of insuf®cient occupancy of SNAD+ in GAPDH, because of the strong binding ability of SNAD+ to GAPDH (Eby & Kirtley, 1976) and the high concentrations of the analogue in the crystallization solution in comparison with the enzyme (ratio 40:1). The well de®ned electron density observed for the the ADP-ribose portion reinforces this viewpoint. The ¯exibility of the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ has been observed in a mutant of GAPDH (Ollivier, 1994). The unique feature found in SNAD+± GAPDH is that the disorder of the thionicotinamide ring only exists in half of the subunits. The structural asymmetry in this complex includes not only the thionicotinamide group but also the active-site-residue arrangement and SNAD+-bindinginduced domain motion. Structural asymmetry with respect to the active-site conformation of the GAPDH tetramer has been observed for the structure of the ternary complex tri¯uoroacetone±NAD+±GAPDH (Garavito et al., 1977). Both of the two structures reveal asymmetry on opposite sides of the R molecular axis. Binding of NAD+ to apo-GAPDH from rabbit or lobster exhibits negative cooperativity. In some cases the binding can be described by assuming two classes of coenzyme binding sites, two tight and two loose sites (Scheek & Slater, 1978; Berni et al., 1979). The appearance of asymmetry in the SNAD+±GAPDH complex seems to support the negative cooperativity of SNAD+ binding or two classes of coenzymebinding sites. However, it was reported that SNAD+ is noncooperatively bound on rabbit GAPDH. It is known that the cooperative behaviour of GAPDH varies with enzyme species and experimental pH value (Velick et al., 1971; Niekamp et al., 1977; de Vijlder & Slater, 1968; Reynolds & Dalziel, 1979). The experiments of SNAD+ non-cooperative binding was carried out at a pH of 7.0 for rabbit muscle GAPDH (Eby & Kirtley, 1971), while the crystallization of SNAD+±GAPDH took place at a pH of 6.1 for lobster muscle GAPDH (Shen, Wang et al., 2000). The kinetic experiment of the binding of SNAD+ to PV GAPDH will be helpful in clarifying this issue. The present SNAD+±GAPDH structure gives unclear indication of structural alterations within the tetramer, which would explain the appearance of asymmetric conformation. It is noted that the four subunits in SNAD+± GAPDH are located in different crystallographic environments; therefore, the differences of subunit conformation in the complex may arise from crystal packing effects. Although the molecular interactions at the crystal contact regions do not directly involve the active site, they may have an effect on the domains orientations and consequently on the conformation of the active site located between the domains. Minor differences in the coenzyme-binding pocket size and domain rotation between the red (or yellow) subunit and the green (or blue) subunit have been observed in the high-resolution structures of apo and holoGAPDH from the same source and these differences were presumably explained by the crystal packing effect (Shen, Li et al., 2000). The crystal packing of SNAD+± GAPDH is basically similar to those of the apo and holo-GAPDH in spite of differences in crystal form (see x3.5). It is likely that the smaller lattice interactions for the yellow or red subunit in SNAD+±GAPDH allow the coenzyme-binding pockets to accommodate the SNAD+ molecule properly, leading to productive active-site conformation, while the tight lattice interactions for the green or blue subunit ®x the domains in a different orientation, thus leading to non-productive active-site Figure 7 conformation. It may be that the green and Crystal packing in C2 (I) (the crystals of holo-and apo-GAPDH) and C2 (II) (the crystals of ADPR±GAPDH and SNAD+±GAPDH). blue subunits failed to anchor the thioniActa Cryst.

cotinamide group in its binding site in a precise conformation, resulting in the disorder of the group and this, vice versa, forced a rearrangement of surrounding residues in the two subunits. The conformations of SNAD+±GAPDH in the red and yellow subunits may represent those in solution owing to lesser lattice restrictions. On the other hand, the green and blue subunits may adopt conformations not preferred in solution owing to the tight lattice interactions. Similar cases have been reported for other proteins (Gerstein et al., 1994; Rossi, 1992). Releasing the lattice force may induce the formation of a fully productive tetramer GAPDH complex. SNAD+ closely resembles the coenzyme NAD+. The subunit conformational similarity between SNAD+±GAPDH and NAD+±GAPDH and the productive positioning of the pyridinum ring relative to active centre Cys149 as seen in the yellow and red subunits in the crystalline state, explains the substrate activity of the coenzyme analogue. Structural studies of GAPDH complexed with coenzyme or its analogues so far demonstrate only two distinctive domain motions. One occurs in the apo-holo transition, resulting in a closed state of the NAD+-binding pocket (type II). The other occurs in the transition for ADP-ribose binding, which does not generate the closed state of the NAD+-binding pocket owing to the lack of the nicontinamide ring (type I). The transition for SNAD+ binding has a type II domain motion in the yellow and red subunits, but a type I domain motion in the green and blue subunits owing to the disorder of the thionicontinamide rings in these two subunits. The disorder of the thionicotinamide ring prevents its speci®c interactions with the protein, including the formation of the important hydrogen bond Asn313 ND2Á Á ÁNS7 SNAD+, leading to ADPribose-binding-like conformational changes. This underlines the importance of the nicotinamide moiety in completing NAD+-induced conformational transition. In the binding of NAD+ to GAPDH, the ADP portion of NAD+ molecule may ®rstly bind to a subunit and produce the type I domain motion; the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ then subsequently binds to the subunit and triggers a series of conformational changes (Skarzynski & Wonacott, 1988) and produces a type II domain motion. Therefore, the type I domain motion may represent an intermediate state in the apo-holo transition. We are grateful for the most valuable suggestions and discussion of Professor Chen-lu Tsou.
