Abstract The crystal structure of the light-harvesting phycobiliprotein, c-phycocyanin from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus ° vulcanus has been refined to 1.6 A resolution based on the previously determined lower resolution structure (PDB entry 1I7Y). The improved data was collected using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The significantly improved crystallographic data has lead to improved calculated electron density maps, allowing the unambiguous positioning of all protein and co-factor atoms and the positioning of 377 solvent molecules. The positions of solvent molecules at specific sites important for stabilization of different levels of self-assembly of the phycobilisome structure were identified and the bonding network is described. The presence of solvent molecules in the vicinity of the co-factors and in intermolecular spaces is identified and their possible roles are suggested. All three of the phycocyanobilin co-factors bind water molecules at specific sites between the propionic acid side chains. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations support that these special waters have a role in stabilization of this conformation. On the basis of the crystal packing reported here and in comparison to other phycobiliprotein crystal forms, we have analyzed the roles of specific sites on the formation of the phycobilisome complex.

1. Introduction Phycobiliproteins are the major light-harvesting components in cyanobacterial, red algae and cryptomonad photosynthesis. In cyanobacteria and red algae, these proteins assemble into large structures known as phycobilisomes. These large complexes are built up from allophycocyanin cores, which in turn bind rods containing phycocyanin and in some cases other phycobiliproteins [1,2]. Each rod is an assembly of trimers of the basic (ah) heterodimer unit [3].

A number of protein linker proteins have been found to have a role in the assembly and in the stability of the phycobilisomes [2,4]. Crystal structures of a number of phycobiliproteins from different sources have been determined [5­ 20]. All structures show a great deal of similarity, with differences in (ah)3 trimer packing [18] and (ah)6 hexamer association [20] in the crystallographic unit cell. Cofactor environment and relative positions have been determined through analysis of these structures, and the detailed parameters needed for energy transfer rate calculation according to Forster theory have been calculated [9,10,18]. A detailed ¨ review on structural insights into phycocyanobilin energy transfer mechanism has been given by Huber [21]. It is accepted that the phycobilisome acts as an energy ``funnel'': energy transverses from pigments with absorption maxima further to the blue down to the lower energy absorbing pigments in the reaction center. This form of energy trapping is quite efficient in the phycobilisome, with fast energy transfer times [2]. However, the driving force for directed energy transfer down the phycobilisome rod is still unclear, since each rod contains many copies of the same cofactors,

organized into identical (ah)3 trimers, which associate further into (ah)6 hexamers. The directionality of energy transfer may be due to the presence of linker proteins bound within the (ah)6 hexamers in an asymmetric fashion [2,16], and/or by the mode of rod formation by (ah)6 hexamers or by rod ­rod interactions [20]. The possible role of bound solvent molecules has not yet been determined. In order to obtain proper quantum mechanical descriptions of energy transfer, structures of the highest resolution possible must be obtained. We have previously determined the structure of c-phy° cocyanin from Synechococcus vulcanus (Sv-PC) at 2.5 A, with data collected at room temperature [22]. In the work presented here, we have used cryocrystallography and synchrotron radiation to determine the Sv-PC structure to ° 1.6 A, which is the highest resolution crystal structure of PC described so far. This new structure has enabled a better description of protein ­ protein and protein ­ solvent interactions and may help understand the role of solvent in the mechanism of energy transfer in phycobilisomes.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Protein isolation and characterization Sv-PC was isolated, analyzed and crystallized as described previously [22]. Crystals were treated briefly in light silicon oil to provide cryo-protection prior to flash freezing in a stream of N2 at 100 K [26]. 2.2. Data collection and structure determination Sv-PC crystallized in the R32 space group with cell ° ° dimensions of a = b = 188.4 A, c= 59.3 A and c = 120j and ° . A data set was collected diffracted maximally to 1.5 A using a single crystal on beamline A1 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS), using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector (Table 1). The data was scaled and merged using the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite [27]. ° The final data was 97.5% complete to 1.6 A and was used for structure determination by molecular replacement with ° AmoRe [28,29] using the 2.5 A Sv-PC structure (PDB code 1I7Y, [22]) as the search model. 2.3. Refinement The structure was refined using CNS [30]. Following simulated annealing, B-factor refinement and water molecule addition, the structure was inspected against electron density maps calculated in Xfit in the Xsight/InsightII program suite (Accelrys.). Extensive use of calculated omit maps were used to manually adjust and confirm the positions of all residues and co-factors. The final model had a crystallographic R-factor of 21.8% and an Rfree of 25.0%.

2.4. Energy minimization (EM) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations Simulations of dynamic changes to PCB structure in the presence and absence of bound solvent molecules was performed using the InsightII-Discover molecular dynamics software package (Accelrys). Each PCB was analyzed separately. Since the PCBs are located in the cytoplasm, the surrounding pH is either neutral or slightly basic and we thus assume that lysine and arginine residues are charged, serine and threonine residues are protonated, and the propionic acids were unprotonated and charged. EM and MD simulations were performed at 333 K (60 jC), the typical growth temperature of Sv. EM was performed until convergence. MD simulations were initiated by performing a short cycle of equilibration (100 cycles) and then run for different times, up to 3000, 1-fs cycles.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Quality of the structure Diffraction data collected following flash freezing of the crystals showed a significant decrease in the dimensions of ° ° the unit cell (f 2 A in each direction) and thus the 1.6 A

phycocyanin structure was determined by molecular re° placement, utilizing the previously determined 2.5 A room-temperature structure (PDB id code 1I7Y, [22]). The refined structure of the (ah) monomer shows high-quality electron density for all protein residues and cofactors (Fig. 1), significantly better than the density calculated for the 1I7Y structure [22] due to the improved resolution and lowtemperature data collection. The overall chain fold of each subunit of the monomer shows the typical phycobiliprotein ° eight a-helical, globin-like structures. The 1.6 A Sv-PC structure is well within all geometric criteria with RMS ° deviations for bond lengths and angles of 0.007 A and 1.18j, respectively (Table 1). The backbone conformations are all within the allowed regions on the Ramachandran plot (data not shown), except for Thrh77 (U = 85.0j, W = 147.5j), which has been shown to have an anomalous conformation in all phycocyanin structures. This residue is in close contact with a chromophore (a84) of the adjacent subunit in the trimeric phycobilisome assembly [8].The coordinates have been deposited in the PDB and given the

code 1KTP. The RMS deviation between the positions of all protein atoms in 1KTP structure as compared to the 1I7Y ° structure is 0.33 A. The 1KTP structure has 377 solvent molecules modeled into the electron density as compared to only 89 molecules in the lower resolution structure. 3.2. Chromophores Both subunits in the monomer have thio-linked PCB chromophores at symmetry related positions between helices E, FVand G [8]. However, the chemical surroundings of these two cofactors are very different due to the formation of the higher-order (ah)3 trimer. The a84 PCB is almost totally excluded from the surrounding solvent while the h84 PCB juts out into the (ah)6 hexameric ring interior (see below). The h-subunit has an additional chromophore at position 155 which is on the outside of the trimeric ring and may be important for intra- and inter-rod energy transfer (see below) [18]. The 1KTP structure shows altered orientations for the h155 PCB propionic acid side chains as compared to the 1I7Ystructure. The B-factors for the chromophores are 20­ 30% lower in the 1KTP structure as compared to the 1I7Y structure. The altered conformation of ring D in the h155 PCB, previously identified in the 1I7Y structure [22] is also present in the 1KTP. This alteration in ring position was proposed to stabilize both the (ah) monomer interaction interface as well as the (ah)6 hexamer formation interface [22]. In the 1KTP structure, these interaction are strengthened further by the presence of five bound solvent molecules, which are about equidistant from aD28, hN35, aV R33 (aVis constituent of the lower (ah)3 trimer) and ring D of the h155 co-factor (Fig. 2). The presence of bound water in these positions at the typical growth temperatures of 55­ 60 jC is probably transient, but could add a significant amount of stabilization energy to both the (ah) monomer and the (ah)6 hexamer. Additional solvent molecules were located in close con° tact (2.6 ­ 3.4 A) with each of the three co-factors. Those solvent molecules associated with PCB h84 (six molecules) and PCB h155 (5 molecules) interact with the molecular edge adjacent to the bulk solvent, while those associated with a84 (four molecules) are positioned in the trimer association interface. These waters may have a role similar to surrounding protein residues in stabilizing the PCB configuration to obtain optimal functionality [21]. The functional role of the PCB propionic acids has not been determined but may be required to help keep the PCB is an unfolded configuration, which alters its absorption spectra [23]. Changes in PCB configuration have been shown to lead to large changes in both absorption and fluorescence characteristics. Interactions between the propionic acids and polar residues have been previously identified for the PCBs in a number of crystal structures [7,9,10,20], and these residues are highly conserved. In the Sv-PC structure, the a84 PCB ring C propionic acid has an additional putative hydrogen bond with aS72 (this

serine residue is a proline in Fd-PC, Sp-PC and Cc-PC). The a84 PCB propionic acids are more tightly bound to the polar residues than either the h84 or h155 PCB. In the new high-resolution structure, all three cofactors bind a solvent molecule in the gap about equidistant between the two propionic carboxyl groups. When a superposition of the three co-factors is performed, these solvent molecules spatially coincide (Fig. 3). It can be thus suggested that these solvent molecules are important for positioning of the propionic side chains in specific conformations. Examination of the Fremyella diplosiphon (Fd-PC) structure shows solvent molecules in similar positions, indicating that this is not characteristic of PC from thermophiles only. The positions of the propionic acids have not been indicated as important for energy transfer per se; however, by obtaining their proper position, these groups may assist in keeping the two central rings on almost the same plane. Another possible role of the propionic acids is in formation of interactions with linker proteins, as can be seen in the Mastigocladus laminosus allophycocyanin structure [16]. ° The charged propionic acids are situated f 6 A apart, and are bound strongly by positively charged or polar groups. It could be assumed that the combination of the repulsive effect of the acids on each other and the attractive forces on their respective other sides would pull them away to some maximal distance. As seen in the crystal structure, this is not the case. In order to try and ascertain whether these solvent residues could indeed have a structural role in the relative orientation of the propionic acid side chains, EM calculations and MD simulations were performed using the Discover software package in InsightII (Accelrys). Each PCB was prepared for MD by the following steps: (i) hydrogen atoms were added automatically; (ii) both the propionic acid carboxyl groups and amino acid residues that interact with them were given proper formal charges; (iii)

the coordinates of all PCB atoms that are tightly associated with the protein matrix via van der Waals contacts [7­ 10] were considered constant with respect to the time scale of the MD simulation (3 ps) and were thus fixed. Simulations were performed at 333 K (60 jC, the typical growth temperature of Sv) in the absence or presence of the solvent molecule found between the propionic acid side chains (Fig. 3). In the case of all three PCBs, in the absence of solvent, the propionic acids indeed move away from one another. In the case of the PCB h84, which is shown in Fig. 4 as representative of all three PCBs, EM calculations show that ° the propionic acids move about 0.7­ 1.0 A further from one another, and closer to the Arg residues that bind them (Fig. 4b). In the presence of the solvent molecules (Fig. 4c), the ° propionic acids remained closer, within 0.15 A of their crystallographic position. When MD simulations were performed, the propionic acids tend to rotate around, for the duration of the simulation, which is much longer than the most of the ultrafast structural changes predicted for either PCB or protein [24]. The bound solvent fluctuates in position, but remains bound even when the simulations were performed for longer periods (data not shown). During the MD simulation, solvent molecules bound at positions other than the one between the propionic acids become unbound from the PCB within f 200 fs (data not shown). When the PCB atoms are released and full movement allowed, the PCB quickly folds into a compact U shape. The presence of the solvent bound to the propionic acid moieties delays the folding by up to 100 fs as opposed to the simulation on PCB without bound solvent (data not shown). We thus conclude that the positions of the propionic acids affect the structure of tetrapyrrole and that the bound solvent molecules help preserve the correct orientation of the propionic acids in the bound PCBs and thus are important for the overall PCB structure.

structures in the 1KTP structure are similar to that seen in the Fd-PC structure, with each trimer stacked directly on top of the next one in a back-to-back fashion. The hexamer thus formed then stacks directly onto the next hexamer in a faceto-face orientation. The hexameric double ring is mainly empty, and the entrance is partially blocked by the loop formed by helix FV(residues h111 ­ h124) and the h84 cofactor, and it is these residues which make contact with the next hexamer in the rod (this contact is probably further stabilized by the presence of linker proteins). In the Cyanidium caldarium PC (Cc-PC) structure, there is a rotation of one hexamer in relation to the next hexamer in

The terminal carboxyl of each propionic acid is colored with carbons in green and oxygens in red.

3.3. Quaternary association All phycobiliprotein structures are produced by the same associative process: (ah) monomer subunit association ! (ah)3 trimer association ! (ah)6 hexamer association ! rods [3]. We ascertained by size-exclusion HPLC that the isolated Sv-PC that was crystallized was in the form of the trimeric (ah)3 unit [22], indicating that the first two steps of the association process involve stable interactions and do not require the presence of linker proteins. A major question, which has been addressed in the cases of previously determined phycobilin protein structures, is how the hexamers and rods are formed, and whether the crystal forms of these proteins are relevant to the in vivo state. A comparison between the crystal structures of PCs from different organisms shows differences in the mode of both stacking and side-by-side hexamer interactions. The trimer and hexamer

The coordinates of PCB atoms in van der Waals contact with the surrounding protein matrix were fixed. The arginine residues and the PCB propionic acid carboxyl groups, which form ionic contacts, were given proper formal charges.

the rod. Rod formation in the Cc-PC arrangement was proposed to be a consequence of differences in the amino acid sequence between Fd-PC and Cc-PC. However, these same differences in the Cc-PC sequence are present in the Sv-PC sequence without hexamer packing changes. The difference can thus be attributed to the difference in the crystal packing forces, although which packing orientation is closer to that formed in vivo cannot be determined with certainty. The fashion of hexamer association forms a spatial separation between co-factor species, with the h84 cofactors pointed in the direction of the hexamer internal space, the a84 co-factors are sequestered within the trimer association domain, and the h155 cofactor pointing out of the hexamer. Each of the three cofactors thus experiences a different environment, which influences the resulting absorption spectra and thus the final functionality of the cofactor. It has been suggested in the past that the h84 PCBs absorb more to the red, and thus are termed f (fluorescing) type chromophores, while the a84 co-factors and the h155 cofactors are of the s (sensitizing) type, which perform radiationless energy transfer. The rod formation interface shown here supports the notion that the positions of the h155 cofactors allow cross-talk between rods, with a separation of 36 ° A between two h155 co-factors on adjacent rods. On the level of side-by side hexamer interactions, the differences are more extensive, and no two structures are exactly alike. Recently, the structure of PC from the mesophilic cyanobacteria Spirulina platensis (Sp-PC) was determined in a novel monoclinic space group [20]. In this crystal form, the asymmetric unit consists of two (ah)6

hexameric disks, joined by contacts in the vicinity of the B155 phycocyanobilin co-factors. This aggregation state does not coincide with the 3-fold and 2-fold crystal symmetry seen in the structure reported here or in other PC or PE structures. The question that has been addressed in most descriptions of PC structures is whether the crystal contacts are the same contacts utilized in the formation of the phycobilisome structure. In all cases, the lack of resolved linker proteins induces a degree of uncertainty in attempting to describe the in vivo complex structure. On the other hand, there is the well-documented propensity for phycobilisome proteins to self-assemble into the various levels of complex aggregation levels, which would at least support a similarity between the crystal and in vivo association mechanism. In the structure described here, the association between two (ah)6 hexamers is induced by the attraction between a relatively small section of the a subunit, consisting of residues mostly from a-helix B: N47, S50, D53, Q57, Q61 and Y135 (Fig. 5), a section of the a subunits that juts out from the (ah)6 hexameric ring. This mode of rod interaction is similar (although not identical) to that of Fd-PC and Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 PC [7]. The later has two different contact sites, but all three the symmetry related h155 PCBs do not make contact. In the Sp-PC structure [20], the contact region is shifted and contains residues from both a and h subunits and the h155 PCB. In native phycobilisomes (as seen in electron micrographs), rods form at most tight doublets. If the Sp-PC structure indeed resembles the in vivo phycobilisome structure, this form of aggregation put those h155 PCBs in the

The h155 PCB molecules are in gray space filling representation. Residues that form contacts between two adjacent a subunits (identified by the black arrow and depicted in various gray CPK shade space filling spheres) between the two hexamers, are on trimers that are not on the same plane.

contact region in an environment different from that of the other h155 PCBs. This would indicate that the 620-nm absorption band of PC in isolated phycobilisomes would be a convolution of four bands--the a84 band (internal pigment with associations with both subunits), the h84 band (external pigment pointing into the internal space of the hexamer and interacting with linker proteins) and the two h155 forms (external form and contact area form). This fourth absorption band has yet to be identified in the spectroscopic studies performed on various aggregations states of phycobiliproteins, which would lend support to an interaction form similar to the one presented in this study and not as in the Sp-PC structure. The arrangement of hexamer aggregation seen in Fig. 5 may also explain the mode of PC rod association with the APC core. In EM studies of intact PB complexes, it appears that the rods do not radiate out from the APC core at equal angles from one another (as many cartoon portrayals show [2,3]). Rather, the APC core is surrounded by three roddoublets, with each doublet of rods running parallel to one another [3,25]. These electron micrographs also appear to show a one-trimer difference in register between adjacent rods, in a fashion similar to the hexamer association in the Sv-PC crystal. This may be important in order to allow for proper connection of the rod end with the APC core. A schematic representation of such rod doublets surrounding the central APC core appeared reviews by Glazer [25] and Huber [21], based on electron micrographs of isolated phycobilisomes [3,25]. These models could be explained by the hexamer packing in the structure presented here. In the model, three rod doublets surround the core. This indicates that each hexamer contacts the adjacent hexamer (in the second rod) in regular repeats, similar to the interactions seen in the crystal. Two of the rod doublets are staggered in their connection point, leading to the ability to fill the space near the top APC subunit. In the crystal, interactions between rods are between the top trimer of one hexamer and the bottom trimer of the adjacent hexamer, leading to such a staggered form. The third rod doublet (perpendicular to the other two) may have an extra trimer on one side to obtain the flush contact with the APC core. This extra trimer may slightly destabilize this rod doublet, and in many electron micrographs, this doublet appears to have degraded [25]. In cases of nutrient deprivation, phycobilisomes are degraded and serve as a source of carbon and nitrogen. The process of phycobilisome degradation may be facilitated by the limited contacts between rods, as seen in the crystal structure.
