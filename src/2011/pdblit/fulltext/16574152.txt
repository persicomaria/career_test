Abstract NRTI-based therapy used to treat AIDS can cause mitochondrial toxicity resulting from the incorporation of NRTIs into mitochondrial DNA by DNA polymerase g (pol g). Pol g has poor discrimination against many of the currently used NRTIs resulting in aborted DNA synthesis and subsequent depletion of mtDNA. Pol g readily incorporates ddCTP, ddITP and D4T-TP with an efficiency similar to the incorporation of normal nucleotides, whereas AZT-TP, CBV-TP, 3TC-TP and PMPApp act as moderate inhibitors to DNA synthesis. We have sought a structural explanation for the unique selection for NRTIs by the human pol g. A structural model of the human pol g was developed to ascertain the role of active site amino acids. One residue in particular, Y951 in motif B, is primarily responsible for the selection of dideoxynucleotides and D4T-TP. Our structural model of the human pol g should assist in rational design of antiviral nucleoside analogs with higher specificity for HIV-RT and minimal selection and incorporation into mitochondrial DNA.

More than 40 million people are infected by the human immunodeficiency virus worldwide, and 5 million new infections occurred during 2003 alone (UNAIDS, 2003). NRTI therapy in HIV infected patients has been beneficial in extending life and slowing the progression of AIDS but treatment with nucleoside analogs is accompanied by certain side effects. The most pronounced side effects from NRTI

therapy are damage to the mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial function. First observed by Dalakas et al. (1990) as mitochondrial myopathies in patients on AZT therapy (Dalakas et al., 1990), NRTI-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is termed mitochondrial toxicity. These patients had induced myopathies with ragged red fibers and reduced amounts of mitochondrial DNA (Arnaudo et al., 1991). Further clinical evidence demonstrated that mitochondrial myopathy slowly and cumulatively develops during AZT treatment (Peters et al., 1993). Mitochondrial toxicity from NRTI treatment mimics mitochondrial genetic diseases and induces similar clinical syndromes, including ragged-red muscle fibers, lactic acidosis, myopathies, cardiomyopathies, hepatic steatosis, lipodystrophy, and neuropathy (Dagan et al., 2002; Lewis et al., 2001, 2003). Early investigations into the observed mitochondrial toxicity implicated the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase g (pol g), in the process of toxicity. Pol g is the sole polymerase in the mitochondria and is responsible for both DNA replication and repair of mtDNA. Polymerase g is composed of two subunits, a larger catalytic subunit (125­140 kDa) with DNA polymerase, exonuclease, and 5 0 -dRP lyase activity (Copeland and Longley, 2003; Lim et al., 1999; Longley et al., 1998a,b) and a smaller accessory subunit that enhances DNA binding and processivity (35­51 kDa). The exonuclease activity of the enzyme allows for proofreading of the growing DNA strand and increases the fidelity of replication (Longley et al., 2001). Although an X-ray structure of the mouse accessory subunit has been solved (Carrodeguas et al., 2001) a three-dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit is lacking. DNA polymerase g is unique among the cellular replicative DNA polymerases in that it is highly sensitive to inhibition by anti-HIV nucleotide analogs such as AZT-TP, dideoxynucleotides, and other antiviral nucleotide analogs (Copeland et al., 1992; Eriksson et al., 1892; Hart et al., 1992; Huang et al., 1990, 1992; Johnson et al., 2001; Kaguni et al., 1988; Lewis et al., 1994; Lim and Copeland, 2001; Longley and Mosbaugh, 1991; Martin et al., 1994; Nickel et al., 1992; Parker et al., 1991). The general inhibitory effect of NRTIs on polymerases is: HIV-RT[pol gOpol bOpol aZpol 3 (Kakuda, 2000). Mitochondrial toxicity may be caused by (1) Direct inhibition

of pol g activity without incorporation (2) Termination of the growing nascent DNA strand by incorporation of these chain-terminating analogs into mitochondrial DNA (3) Alteration of the fidelity of DNA synthesis of pol g (4) The persistence of these analogs in mtDNA due to inefficient excision or (5) A combination of any of these effects. Kinetic studies indicate that the apparent in vitro hierarchy of mitochondrial toxicity for the approved NRTIs is: ddC(zalcitabine)RddI(didanosine)RD4T(stavudine) O3TC(lamivudine)OPMPA(tenofovir)OAZT(zidovudine)OCBV(abacavir) (Johnson et al., 2001; Lim and Copeland, 2001) (Fig. 1). During in vitro chain elongation by pol g, dideoxynucleotides and D4T-TP are utilized at least as efficiently as natural deoxynucleotides, whereas AZT-TP, 3TC-TP, PMPA and CBV-TP are only moderate inhibitors of DNA chain elongation (Johnson et al., 2001; Lim and Copeland, 2001). Once incorporated the polymerase may remove the terminal NRTI with the exonuclease activity intrinsic to pol g. We previously found that pol g is inefficient in removing terminally incorporated dideoxynucleotides, D4T, AZT, and CBV from

Fig. 1. Discrimination of the anti-HIV NRTIs by pol g. The comparison of the discrimination by pol g against each NRTI is presented. The discrimination factor, presented as a log scale, is determined from the ratio of kinetic values for incorporation of the analogs versus incorporation of the normal nucleotides. The data for ddC, ddT, D4T, CBV, AZT and 3TC were derived from Lim and Copeland (2001) while data from ddA and PMPA were derived from Johnson et al. (2001). All analogs tested were in their fully phosphorylated form.

DNA (Lim and Copeland, 2001). This finding predicts persistence of these analogs in vivo following successful incorporation. In contrast, removal of 3 0 terminal 3TC residues is 50% as efficient as natural 3 0 termini, predicting reduced persistence and lower toxicity for this analog. In addition to the triphosphate form of these analogs, metabolic intermediates have the potential to inhibit pol g or other cellular polymerases. The cellular conversion of AZT to AZT-TP has been shown to accumulate the monophosphate intermediate in vivo at millimolar concentration (Frick and Nelson, 1988; Furman and Fyfe, 1986). We have shown that pol g exonuclease activity is inhibited by AZT-monophosphate at concentrations known to occur in cells (Lim and Copeland, 2001). Thus, although their greatest inhibitory effects are through incorporation and chain termination, persistence of these analogs in DNA and inhibition of exonucleolytic proofreading are also likely to contribute to mitochondrial toxicity. 3TC-TP is one of analogs least likely to be incorporated and yet is one of those most efficiently removed. This may explain the low mitochondrial toxicity induced by 3TC in vivo. Although AZT-TP is one of the analogs least likely to be incorporated into DNA by pol g, once incorporated it is not efficiently removed from DNA by the pol g exonuclease function. The inefficiency of pol g to remove AZT from DNA may help to explain some of the AZT-induced mtDNA depletion observed in vivo. The kinetics of incorporation of NRTIs suggest that AZT-TP is only a moderate inhibitor of pol g. Despite kinetic explanations, the wide range of clinical toxicities reported from AZT therapy indicate a more potent toxicity from this analog. This has prompted many investigators to seek alternative mechanisms of toxicity such as oxidation (Hayakawa et al., 1995), inhibition of glycosylation (Hall et al., 1994; Steet et al., 2000; Yan et al., 1995), and inhibition of the ADP/ATP translocator (Barile et al., 1997; Valenti et al., 2000). Over 10 years ago, AZT was shown to be reduced in vitro by thiols to produce a wide range of products (Handlon and Oppenheimer, 1988; Lacey et al., 1992)). The most common product upon reduction of AZT by DTT is D4T, where 31% of the products resulted in D4T (Reardon and Crouch, 1994). Recently, significant levels of D4T were found in HIV-infected patients undergoing only AZT

treatment suggesting intracellular reduction of AZT to D4T (Becher et al., 2003). Given the moderate inhibition by AZT-TP of pol g and the strong inhibitory affect of D4T-TP on pol g, these new findings indicate the majority of AZT toxicity may result from in vivo conversion of AZT to D4T. For example, a mere 0.05% conversion of AZT to D4T would result in toxicity seen with D4T therapy alone (see Fig. 1). Polymerase g is a Family A polymerase, defined by the characteristic consensus ABC motifs (Delarue et al., 1990) (shown in sequence alignment in Fig. 2). Although the X-ray crystal structure of polymerase g has not yet been determined, the structures of several other Family A polymerases have been solved, in various binary and/or ternary complexes which include metal ions, template and primer DNA and incoming dNTP substrate. These include E. coli Klenow polymerase I (PDB entries: 1DPI, 1KFS, 1KRP, 1KSP, 1QSL, 1KFD, 1KLN, 2KFN, 2KZM, 2KZZ, 1D8Y, 1D9D, 1D9F) (Beese et al., 1993a,b; Brautigam et al., 1999; Li et al., 1998a; Ollis et al., 1985), Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I large fragment (PDB entries: 1BDP,2BDP,3BDP,4BDP, 1XWL) (Kiefer et al., 1998; Kiefer et al., 1997), Thermus aquaticus KlenTaq polymerase I (PDB entries: 1CMW, 1TAQ, 1TAU, 1KTQ, 2KTQ, 3KTQ, 4KTQ, 5KTQ, 1BGX, 1JXE, 1QSS, 1QSY, 1QTM)(Eom et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1995; Korolev et al., 1995; Li et al., 1998b, 1999; Murali et al., 1998; Urs et al., 1999), and the ternary complex bacteriophage T7 polymerase DNA (PDB entry: 1T7P) (Doublie et al., 1998). Although these polymerases do not share high sequence conservation outside the ABC motifs (Fig. 2) (for example, sequence homology between B. stearothermophilus pol I and E. coli pol I is only 49%)(Kiefer et al., 1998), they, and many DNA and RNA polymerases and HIV-RT share significant structural homology and conserved structural features. The RMS deviation of the polymerase active site region (i.e. palm subdomain) between B. stearother° mophilus and E. coli is only 0.65 A (Ca atoms) (Kiefer et al., 1998). It is therefore possible to model and predict the structure of human polymerase g catalytic active site based on the structures of previously solved family A DNA polymerases. The polymerase domain structure has been described as being similar to a right hand with fingers,

palm and thumb subdomains (Ollis et al., 1985) (Fig. 3). The palm subdomain contains the carboxylates that coordinate the two metal ions that participate in nucleotidyl-transfer and facilitates

catalysis of the phosphoryl-transfer reaction. Important interactions with the incoming nucleoside triphosphate and template base occur within the fingers domain. The thumb domain interacts with the duplex

DNA and probably plays an important role in processivity and translocation. The structural homology between family A polymerases, such as pol g, and HIV reverse transcriptase (Fig. 4) probably accounts for the difficulty in structurally designing nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors as selective inhibitors. This conservation gave us the opportunity to construct a model of the pol g active site. There is greater structural divergence between different polymerase families in the fingers and thumb domain. Most DNA polymerases have a conserved active site geometry that includes a kink in the 5 0 end of the template DNA strand and a conformational change in the fingers subdomain that changes the binary polymerase-DNA from an `open' conformation to a ternary `closed' conformation complex upon binding substrate (both shown in Fig. 3) (Beard and Wilson, 2003; Brautigam and Steitz, 1998; Doublie and Ellenberger, 1998; Doublie et al., 1999; Steitz, 1999). Solved family A polymerase structures indicate that the reactive groups in the catalytic domain share a conserved structural arrangement within the polymerase active site. One metal ion contacts all 3 phosphates of the bound nucleotide, and the second metal ion is between the a-phosphate of the nucleotide and the 3 0 end of the primer strand. Based on the structural similarity between pol g and other family A polymerases, three conserved amino acids in the A and C motifs of human pol g

were studied for their role in NRTI selection (Lim et al., 2003). The amino acid Y951 was changed to phenylalanine and alanine, Y955 was changed to phenylalanine and alanine, and E895 was changed to alanine. These three residues are involved in selectivity towards incoming dNTPs. Alteration of Y951 to phenylalanine increases the discrimination towards dideoxynucleosides and D4T-TP by several 1000-fold with minimal effect on overall polymerase activity (Lim et al., 2003). More dramatic alteration of this residue to alanine demonstrates a modest 5- to 15fold increase in discrimination against these two analogs, primarily due to a dramatic drop in overall polymerase function with normal nucleotides by this mutation. Thus, Y951 plays the largest role in selection of dideoxynucleosides, D4T-TP, and to a lesser extent with 3TC-TP and CBV-TP. The role of Y951 in dideoxynucleotide selection was predicted based on the analogous residue in T7 DNA polymerase where Tabor and Richardson demonstrated that converting Y526 to phenylalanine in T7 DNA polymerase rendered the enzyme resistant to dideoxynucleotides (Tabor and Richardson, 1995). As is the case with T7 DNA polymerase (Doublie et al., 1998), the hydroxyl group of the Y951 side chain appears to form a hydrogen bond network with the b-phosphoryl-oxygen and the 3 0 -OH of the incoming dNTP. In the absence of the 3 0 -OH moiety, as with ddC or D4T, the incoming nucleotide analog is stabilized in

the active site by the Y951 hydrogen bond to the b-phosphoryl oxygen, allowing efficient incorporation. Alteration of Y955 and E895 to alanine also increased discrimination of the enzyme towards D4T

and CBV by several 100-fold. Thus, Y955 and E895 act together to form the steric block against ribonucleotides and interact with the rigid sugar rings of D4T-TP and CBV-TP. Interestingly, none

of the pol g active site mutant proteins displayed enhanced discrimination against AZT-TP (Lim et al., 2003). A structural homology model for the polymerase domain (defined as residues 871-1145) of human mitochondrial polymerase g (Fig. 4C) was developed based on the solved X-ray crystal structures of other family A polymerases. Since the incoming nucleotide has large solvent accessibility in the open form and is partially buried in the closed form, we chose to model the closed conformation in hope of providing greater insights into the polymerase catalytic mechanism. In the closed conformation (Fig. 3B), the fingers subdomain is rotated inwards toward the primer-template DNA so that the O-helix is closer to the nucleotidebinding site, permitting residues R943, K947 and Y951 to contact the sugar and incoming nucleotide phosphates (Figs. 3 and 4C) (Doublie et al., 1998). A large 30-residue loop insertion in pol g (residues 1053­1082 in Fig. 2) was replaced with three alanines in the modeled structure, as a credible modeling of this large loop inserted in the structure is not feasible. DNA polymerases catalyze the stepwise addition of mononucleotides onto the 3 0 -OH terminus of a DNA primer through an in-line nucleophilic attack of the 3 0 OH on the aPO4 of the incoming dNTP. The reaction sequence involves binding of DNA template-primer, binding to incoming dNTP, phosphodiester bond formation, release of pyrophosphate, and translocation to the nascent 3 0 -OH primer terminus. HIV reverse transcriptase has both a DNA polymerase activity, that can copy either DNA or RNA templates, and an RNase H activity, that degrades RNA in a RNA­DNA duplex. Nucleoside analogs inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase by acting as chain terminators. A number of X-ray

crystal structures have been solved for the polymerase domain of HIV-RT both in the presence and absence of nucleoside inhibitors (Ding et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1998; Kohlstaedt et al., 1992; Sarafianos et al., 2002Sarafianos et al., 1999; Sarafianos et al., 2001), and the polymerase active site of HIV-RT can be compared directly with that of the modeled pol g (Fig. 4). HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer consisting of p66 (w560 residues) and p51 (w440 residues). The catalytic polymerase domain is resident in the p66 subunit and includes three conserved Asp residues at positions 110, 185, and 186. The palm subdomain consists of a fivestranded b-sheet with 2 a-helices on one side (Fig. 4B). The palm domains of polymerase A family members retain their structural similarity with the HIV-RT palm domain despite very little sequence similarity outside specifically conserved catalytic residues in motifs A and C (Fig. 2). As can be seen in Fig. 4 the b-strands of the HIV-RT palm domain can be superimposed and are structurally equivalent to the b-strands in the polymerase A family structures. The RT YMDD motif, motif C, containing the 2 catalytically important D185 and D186 residues, can be structurally superimposed on the b-turn structure (Fig. 4), containing D1135 and E1136 of the HDE motif in pol g and all family A polymerases (see Table 1 and Fig. 2 sequence alignment). From mutational studies, D185, D186 and D110 in HIV-RT appear to play the same catalytic role as the corresponding residues in family A polymerases (D882, E883 and D705 in KF for example). These residues bind divalent metal ions in KF. HIV RT does not contain an a-helix corresponding to the O-helix in KF (Kohlstaedt et al., 1992). The YXDD motif makes an unusual type II b-turn that positions these side chains on the surface where they

interact with template-primer DNA, incoming nucleotide and metal cofactors. These residues are present in the dNTP binding site of the p66 subunit of HIV-RT: Y115, F116, F160, Q151 and L74. The ternary structure is closed with fingers folded down towards the dNTP binding site, like the family A polymerase structures (example shown in Fig. 3). Most of the conserved residues in family A polymerases and RT ° are 10 A from the active site forming a continuous conserved surface emanating from the palm to the fingers and thumb. In the binary and ternary structures of HIV-RT, the fingers rotate toward the template primer DNA bringing the finger residues toward the polymerase active site of the palm subdomain. Residues K65­R72 in HIV-RT are structurally analogous to R518­K522 in T7 (R754-R758 in KlenowR659­K663 in Klentaq). The K65 3-amino group and the R72 guanidinium group from these conserved finger residues make salt bridges with the a- and g-phosphates of the incoming dNTP. These residues are analogous to R943 and K947 in pol g(Fig. 4C). Binding of dNTP and metals induces repositioning of the 3 0 primer-terminus and the active site carboxylate side chains (D110 in HIV-RT, D610 Klentaq, and D890 in pol g). These conserved active site residues are tabulated in Table 1. Polymerase fidelity arises structurally from the steric constraints imposed on base pairing at the polymerase active site, enforcing Watson­Crick base pairing, and the editing of mismatched base pairs at the exonuclease active site. Based on analogy to the solved family A polymerase structures and the structure of HIV-RT, it is clear from the pol g model that residues R943 and K947 participate in pyrophosphate binding, and residues D890, V891, D1135 and E1136 participate in binding the dNTP-Mg2C complex. In this closed pol g model, the incoming nucleotide is located near the three active site carboxylates which correspond to D1135, E1136 of the HDE (motif C) and D890 in motif A. The open to closed conformational change affects the orientation of the O-helix. The O-helix is involved in dNTP binding (Kiefer et al., 1998) and incorporation. The tyrosine residue (Y955 in pol g) in the C-terminal end of the O-helix (corresponding to motif B) of the family A polymerases, inserts and base stacks with the template DNA. The I-helix forms most of the DNA contacts.

From the structural model, it can readily be seen why the Y955 mutation has such a dramatic effect, as it is in the C-terminus of the O-helix and inserts and base stacks with the template DNA. Mutation of this residue to alanine or cysteine would destroy this base stacking interaction. This residue is also in close proximity and interacts with Y951. Y951 is involved in recognition of the incoming dNTP and sugar ring. Thus, the Y955 mutation would effect the Y955­ Y951 interaction and possibly have an effect on recognition of the incoming nucleotide and its sugar moiety. In pol g, Y951, E895, and Y955 (corresponding to Y526, E480 and Y530 in T7) form a hydrophobic pocket near the C2 0 sugar position in the active site that provides a structural basis for the selectivity and discrimination against ribonucleotides. In summary, the pol g model provides structural insight into the function of many of the conserved amino acids in the active site. These residues are important for nucleoside triphosphate recognition, DNA binding, and catalysis, and they modulate the high fidelity of DNA synthesis exhibited by pol g. Many of these active site residues also allow for the selection and incorporation of NRTIs that cause chain termination in mtDNA and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. The pol g structural model should be beneficial in predicting the ability of human pol g to select new NRTIs, which will help to advance new anti-HIV therapies and drug design. We wish to thank Drs. William Beard and Matthew Longley for critical reading of this manuscript.
