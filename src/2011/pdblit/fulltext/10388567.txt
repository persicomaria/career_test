The crystal structure of purple acid phosphatase from rat bone has been determined by molecular replacement and the structure has been re®ned Ê to 2.2 A resolution to an R-factor of 21.3 % (R-free 26.5 %). The core of the enzyme consists of two seven-stranded mixed b-sheets, with each sheet ¯anked by solvent-exposed a-helices on one side. The two sheets pack towards each other forming a b-sandwich. The di-iron center, located at the bottom of the active-site pocket at one edge of the b-sandwich, contains a m-hydroxo or m-oxo bridge and both metal ions are observed in an almost perfect octahedral coordination geometry. The electron density map indicates that a m-(hydr)oxo bridge is found in the metal center and that at least one solvent molecule is located in the ®rst coordination sphere of one of the metal ions. The crystallographic study of rat purple acid phosphatase reveals that the mammalian enzymes are very similar in overall structure to the plant enzymes in spite of only 18 % overall sequence identity. In particular, coordination and geometry of the iron cluster is preserved in both enzymes and comparison of the active-sites suggests a common mechanism for the mammalian and plant enzymes. However, signi®cant differences are found in the architecture of the substrate binding pocket.

Introduction
Acid phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of monophosphate esters and, in some cases, transfer of a phosphoryl group between a phosphoester and an alcohol at low pH values (pH range from 4-7). These enzymes are widely spread in the plant and animal kingdom, and can be classi®ed into three groups, the low-molecular mass acid phosphatases (18-20 kDa), the high molecular mass acid phosphatases (45-60 kDa) and a third group containing a binuclear iron center as prosthetic group (Vincent et al., 1992). The latter class of enzymes is characterized by an intense purple color, caused by a tyrosine-Fe(III) charge transfer transition at $560 nm (Gaber et al., 1979; Averill et al., 1987).

The purple acid phosphatases are also called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases (TRAP), since they show little inhibition by tartrate, a potent inhibitor of other acid phosphatases (Vincent & Averill, 1990). Mammalian purple acid phosphatase is expressed in activated macrophages in various tissues, for instance in spleen, lung, placenta and, in particular, at high levels in osteoclasts of growing bone (Andersson et al., 1992). The physiological function of purple acid phosphatase is not yet established but transgenic mice lacking this enzyme show mild osteopetrosis (Hayman et al., 1996). TRAP has been found in intracellular vesicles of a newly described transcytotic pathway in osteoclasts (Salo et al., 1997). These ®ndings indicate that TRAP might have a role in bone resorption and bone mineralization. Recently, free oxygen radicals have been implicated in bone resorption (Key et al., 1994) and it has been speculated that the very reactive hydroxyl radicals

Because of the strictly regulated expression of TRAP, the enzyme has been used as a histochemical and biochemical marker for osteoclasts and bone resorption. Immuno-assays based on poly- and monoclonal antibodies against TRAP have been developed (Chamberlain et al., 1995; Halleen et al., 1996). Increased concentration of TRAP in the serum of children, post-menopausal women and patients with metabolic bone diseases have been found (Halleen et al., 1996; Cheung et al., 1995). Mammalian purple acid phosphatases are ironcontaining, monomeric glycoproteins with a molecular mass of $35 kDa (Vincent & Averill, 1990). The amino acid sequences of mammalian enzymes are very similar, with amino acid identities of 87-95 % (Ek-Rylander et al., 1991). The purple acid phosphatases are synthesized as precursor enzymes containing an N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved off in the mature enzyme. The enzyme isolated from rat bone (Ek-Rylander et al., 1991), human (Marshall et al., 1997) and bovine spleen (Orlando et al., 1993) consists of two polypeptide chains of molecular mass of about 20 kDa and 16 kDa, respectively, probably as a result of a post-translational proteolytic cleavage. The two subunits are linked through disul®de bonds. Recombinant rat enzyme is, however, a single polypeptide chain (Ek-Rylander et al., 1997; Kaija et al., 1999). The enzyme is glycosylated and the amino acid sequence reveals two potential sites for N-glycosylation (Ek-Rylander et al., 1991; Kaija et al., 1999). The physiological substrate(s) for TRAP is not known, but it has been shown that the enzyme can dephosphorylate a wide variety of phosphomonoesters such as p-nitrophenylphosphate, nucleotide di- and triphosphates, phosphotyrosine and phosphorylated proteins (Lau et al., 1987; Halleen et al., 1998). In particular, evidence has been provided that the enzyme from bone can dephosphorylate bone-matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein (Ek-Rylander et al., 1994). The di-nuclear iron center of purple acid phosphatases has been studied extensively using various spectroscopic techniques (Gaber et al., 1979; Averill et al., 1987; Antanaitis & Aisen, 1982; Antanaitis et al., 1983; David & Que, 1990; Dietrich et al., 1991; Doi et al., 1988; Holz et al., 1992; Scarrow et al., 1990; True et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1992; Wang & Que, 1998). The enzyme shows the characteristic purple color in the oxidized, inactive Fe(III)-Fe(III) state, whereas in the active pink form, the dinuclear iron center is present in a mixed valence state Fe(III)-Fe(II) (Vincent & Averill, 1990; Antanaitis & Aisen, 1982; Doi et al., 1988). The crystal structure of an analogous plant enzyme, which contains a Fe(III)-Zn(II) center instead of the di-nuclear iron center, the purple acid phosphatase from red kidney bean, has been

È determined (Strater et al., 1995; Klabunde et al., 1996). Here, we describe the crystal structure of recombinant purple acid phosphatase from rat bone. The structure was determined using very tiny crystals (largest dimension $30mm) and molecular replacement based on the coordinates of the plant enzyme (amino acid sequence identity $18 % based on the structural alignment). The structure analysis provides crystallographic evidence for a di-nuclear iron center with a m-hydroxo (or m-oxo) bridge.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination and quality of the electron density map The structure of rat TRAP has been determined by molecular replacement using the atomic coordinates of TRAP from red kidney bean. In spite of the low level of sequence similarity, the structure solution proceeded without major obstacles and resulted in a ®nal electron density map of excellent quality (Figure 1). The electron density is continuous for the whole polypeptide chain and with a few exceptions all protein atoms are de®ned in electron density. The ®rst three residues at the N terminus and the last two C-terminal residues cannot be modelled, probably due to disorder, and a few side-chains at the surface of the protein are not de®ned in electron density. Weak density is found also for a surface loop, comprising residues 146-149. The ®nal model contains residues 26-335 (the ®rst 22 amino acid residues correspond to the signal peptide that is removed in the mature enzyme), two Fe ions, two Zn ions, two sulphate groups, two N-acetyl glucosamine residues and 103 water molecules. Two amino acid residues, Pro43 and Phe77, are found in the cis conforÊ mation. The model has been re®ned at 2.2 A resolution to an R-factor of 21.3 % (R-free 26.5 %) with good stereochemistry (Table 1). The majority of residues (86.2 %) is found in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot with two outliers (Table 1). Arg147 is located in an exposed loop at the protein surface and has weak electron density. The second outlier, His242, is a ligand of one of the metal ions in the dinuclear iron center. This residue and Asn245 in the generously allowed region are well de®ned in electron density. Overall structure of the enzyme Rat purple acid phosphatase is a globular Ê Ê enzyme with overall dimensions 36 A Â 42 A Ê Â 54 A (Figure 2). The structure consists of two seven-stranded mixed b-sheets with different topologies. Sheet 1 has strand order b4, b3, b2, b1, b12, b13 and b14 with topology 1x, 1x, 1x, À4, À1, À1 in the nomenclature introduced by Richardson (1981). Three a-helices are located on one side of this sheet facing the solvent. The second sheet with strand order b5, b6, b7, b8, b10,

b9 and b11 is described by topology 1, 1x, 1x, 2, À1, 2x. This sheet also has three a-helices on one side, exposed to solvent. In the enzyme subunit, the two sheets pack towards each other and form a b-sandwich-like structure (Figure 2). The active-site including the di-iron center is located at

one edge of this b-sandwich, with residues involved in binding of the metal ions located in loops at the carboxy ends of strands b1, b2, b3, b7 and b8 (Figure 2). The assignment of secondary structure elements to the amino acid sequence is given in Figure 3.

Figure 2. A view of the structure of rat purple acid phosphatase. The iron ions of the di-nuclear metal center are shown as purple spheres, the Zn ion as a gray sphere, bound sulfate ions, carbohydrate molecules and the conserved cysteine residues are shown as ball-andstick models. The lysosomal targeting sequence in the beginning of helix a2 is shown in gray. The proteolytic cleavage site found in wild-type, non-recombinant enzyme is indicated by an arrow. The Figure was generated with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster 3D (Merrit & Murphy, 1994).

Mammalian purple acid phosphatases are monomeric enzymes in solution and analysis of the crystal packing interactions reveals that rat TRAP is a monomer also in the crystal. Strong electron density was observed at the contact region between two symmetry-related molecules and has been interpreted as a Zn ion, since the addition of Zn ions was necessary for crystallisation to occur. The metal ion is coordinated in a tetrahedral geometry to the side-chain oxygen atoms of Glu90 and Asp94 from one molecule and an imidazole nitrogen atom of His284 from another molecule, thus linking the two molecules in the crystal lattice. Subcellular fractionation as well as immunocytochemistry (Andersson et al., 1986) have provided evidence that rat TRAP is localized in lysosomes. A conserved sequence motif starting from residue 85, DKRFQ, which is a variant of the consensus sequence for lysosomal targeting, KFERQ (Dice, 1990) has been noted in the amino acid sequence (Ek-Rylander et al., 1991a,b). This sequence motif comprises the N terminus of helix a2 at the surface of the enzyme, but with the arginine residue buried. If this side-chain is required for lysosomal import, at least partial unfolding seems required. TRAP when isolated from human bone (Halleen et al., 1996; Marshall et al., 1997), rat bone and bovine spleen (Orlando et al., 1993) is found predominantly in a form consisting of two subunits of

approximately 20 and 16 kDa, linked by a disul®de bridge. Cleavage of recombinant purple acid phosphatase by trypsin, which generates the same subunit pattern, activates the enzyme (Kaija et al., 1999). The cleavage site is located in an exposed active-site loop following strand b6 (Figure 2). The physiological signi®cance of the limited proteolysis is not quite clear and the post-translational cleavage might be an artifact of the puri®cation procedure. Three cysteine residues are found in the sequence of the rat enzyme, and two of these, Cys163 and Cys221, are positioned such that they might form a disul®de bond (Figure 2). However, in the difference electron density maps, there is no indication for the formation of a disul®de bond in the crystals. Purple acid phosphatases are glycoproteins, and the recombinant rat enzyme produced in insect cells is also isolated as a glycoprotein (Ek-Rylander et al., 1997; Kaija et al., 1999). Mass spectroscopy of samples used for crystallization indicate a mass difference of about 2000 Da from the molecular mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence contains two sequence motifs typical of N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn118 and Asn149. Both residues are located at surface loops and the side-chains of these residues point into large cavities formed in the crystal lattice that could accommodate the emanating carbohydrate chains. Residue Asn149 is located on a less-well

Figure 3. Sequence alignment and secondary structure elements of purple acid phosphatase. The sequences of TRAP from rat bone (top) and red kidney bean are aligned based on a structural alignment using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). Capital letters denote residues that are structurally equivalent in the two structures. Bold letters are used to indicate residues that are invariant in the amino acid sequences for the mammalian enzymes (top sequence, SwissProt accession numbers: rat P29288, human P13686, mouse Q05117, pig P09889) and plant enzymes (bottom sequence, kidney bean P80366, Arabidopsis thaliana Q38924), respectively. The sequences for the predicted N-terminal signal peptides are not included. Also not included in the Figure is the sequence corresponding to the N-terminal domain of the plant enzymes, since this domain is absent in the mammalian purple acid phosphatases.

de®ned loop and no indication for bound carbohydrate is seen in the electron density map. The loop harboring Asn118 is, however, much better de®ned and a short carbohydrate chain consisting of two N-acetylglucosamine molecules covalently linked to the side-chain of Asn118 could be modelled into the electron density (Figure 1(b)). Remaining parts of the carbohydrate chain are not seen in the map, most likely due to disorder. The di-iron center At one end of the b-sandwich, a pocket is formed by loops connecting the secondary structure elements (Figures 2 and 4). At the bottom of this active-site cleft, the di-nuclear iron center is located, and protein ligands to the metal ions are provided by residues located on loops extending from b-strands b1, b2, b3, b7 and b8. Strands b1, b2, b3 together with connecting a-helices form a b-a-b-a-b motif that is found also in other dinuclear metallophosphatases such as serine/threonine phosphatase-1 (Goldberg et al., 1995) and calcineurin (Grif®th et al., 1995) although these enzymes are unrelated to TRAP in overall amino acid sequence and 3D structure. Amino acid sequence comparisons of a number of phosphoesterases,

including purple acid phosphatases, and Ser/Thr protein phosphatases had revealed a conserved ®ngerprint DXG/H-Xn-GDXX(Y/X)-Xn-GNH(E/D) (n approx. 25-30) (Koonin 1994). The structure of calcineurin (Grif®th et al., 1995), Ser/Thr protein phosphatase-1 (Goldberg et al., 1995) and plant È TRAP (Strater et al., 1995) showed that this ®ngerprint is located at the carboxyl end of the b-strands in the shared b-a-b-a-b motif with conserved residues coordinating the metal ions. The signature sequence can thus be described as a metallo-phosphoesterase motif (Goldberg et al., 1995). This sequence pattern is found also in the mammalian purple acid phosphatases with the same function in metal binding. The di-nuclear iron center as seen in our crystals most likely represents the oxidized, ferric form of the enzyme as the recombinant enzyme is isolated predominantly in its oxidized form (Ek-Rylander et al., 1997; Kaija et al., 1999). The metal ions are bound to the protein through a number of conserved amino acid side-chains (Figure 5). One of the iron ions is ligated to the side-chains of Asp35, Tyr76, and His244, and the second metal ion is coordinated to Asn112, His207, and His242 (Table 2). This metal ion also forms a coordination bond to one of the oxygen atoms of a bound sul-

phate ion (see below). Both metal ions are bridged through the coordination to one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp73. In the cluster, the two iron Ê ions are separated by 3.5 A. In the ®nal difference electron density maps, strong positive difference electron densities (peak heights four and ®ve times the standard deviation of the electron density map, respectively) was found very close to the metal cluster (Figure 5). We interpreted these electron densities as a solvent molecule bound to one of the metal ions and a bridging oxygen atom, which most likely represents a m-hydroxo or a m-oxo bridge. In general terms, the structure of the iron center in rat TRAP is consistent with the results from spectroscopic studies on mammalian purple acid phosphatases. For instance, EPR studies indicated

the presence of a di-iron center, which could be transformed from an EPR silent Fe(III)-Fe(III) valence state to the EPR active, mixed valence state Fe(III)-Fe(II) upon reduction (Averill et al., 1987; Antanaitis & Aisen, 1982; Doi et al., 1988). Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance studies provided evidence for coordination of tyrosine and histidine to one Fe(III) ion and one histidine ligand to a Fe(II) ion (Wang et al., 1992) and for the participation of a carboxylate group in the ligand sphere (Holz et al., 1992). EXAFS studies on uteroferrin, the purple acid phosphatase from pig uterus (True Ê et al., 1993) gave metal-metal distances of 3.5 A. The presence of a m-(hydr)oxo bridge in TRAP had been implicated from the results of various spectroscopic studies (Averill et al., 1987; True et al., 1993).

This map was calculated before any solvent ligand had been included in the model. (b) A view of the di-iron center and the activesite of rat purple acid phosphatase as seen in the crystals. Dotted lines indicate hydrogen-bonds or coordination bonds.

The active-site The di-iron center is accessible via a channel extending from the the protein surface (Figures 2 and 4). Aside from the invariant ligands to the metal ions, this cleft is lined by a number of highly conserved hydrophilic residues, i.e. His113, Ser166, Asp167, Gln172, Glu215, His216, and Asp267 (underlined residues are conserved also in the plant enzymes) and the hydrophobic residues Phe77 and Phe265. In the difference electron density maps, signi®cant residual electron density (peak heights >10s) was observed in the active-site close to the metal cluster. Based on shape and peak height of this residual electron density and the local environment, it was interpreted as bound sulphate and Zn ions, respectively. Both ions are found in excess in the crystallisation liquor (5 mM ZnSO4 and 2.2 M ammonium sulphate, respectively). One of the oxygen atoms of the sulphate ion forms a coordination bond to an iron ion in the metal cluster, and a hydrogen bond to the sidechain of Asn112 (Figure 5(b)). Another oxygen atom interacts with the side-chain of His113 in the substrate cleft and a third oxygen atom is coordi-

nating the bound Zn ion. The external Zn ion, which is accessible from the bulk solution, is coordinated also to the side-chain of His216. We consider the binding of this metal ion as a crystallization artifact due to the addition of ZnSO4 to the protein solution prior to crystallization. It should be noted that Zn ions are strong inhibitors of phosphatase activity for the mammalian enzymes (Andersson et al., 1992) which might be due to binding in the active-site channel and blocking access to the iron center as seen in the crystals. The sulphate ion binds in a position similar to the phosphate group in the plant purple acid phosphatase (Klabunde et al., 1996) and provides clues as to the binding of the phosphate group in the Michaelis complex (see below). Comparison to the plant enzyme The plant purple acid phosphatases with known amino acid sequence have one additional domain of unknown function at the N terminus that is not found in the mammalian enzymes. In addition, the enzyme from kidney bean that was used in the structure determination is a dimer, whereas the

Figure 6. Superposition of the structure of purple acid phosphatase from rat (purple) and kidney bean (blue). In rat TRAP, the long insertion in the loop between b6 and a5 (seen at the top of the Figure) folds over the active-site, resulting in a less open substratebinding pocket as compared to the plant enzyme. The N-terminal domain of the plant enzyme is not included, since it is not found in the mammalian phosphates.

mammalian enzymes are monomers. Mammalian enzymes show a high degree of similarity in their amino acid sequence (85-95 % identities) whereas the sequence identity between rat and kidney bean TRAP is only 18 % (Figure 3). Comparison of the structures of the enzymes from rat and kidney bean revealed that, in spite of this low overall similarity in sequence, the overall 3D structures are very similar (Figure 6). Superposition resulted in 214 equivalent Ca atoms with an r.m.s. deviation Ê of 1.43 A, using the LSQ option in the program O with the default parameters (Jones et al., 1991). The core of the subunit structure is well preserved in both enzymes, in particular the b-strands superimpose very well. This conserved core is presumably the reason why molecular replacement was successful in spite of the low overall sequence identity. The rat enzyme has one more b-strand, b5, located at the edge of sheet 2. In the plant enzyme, this side of the sheet is involved in packing interactions with the N-terminal domain. Many of the loops differ in size and conformation, in particular those forming the walls of the active-site at the carboxy end of the b-sandwich. At the N-terminal end, differences in loop size and conformation are less pronounced, with the exception of the loop between b9 and b10, which is rather short in rat TRAP but is a long loop protruding into the solvent in the plant enzyme.

The differences in size and conformation of the active-site loops make the active-site in the rat enzyme less accessible. In particular, the long insertion between b6 and a5 closes off and restricts access to the active-site as compared to the plant enzyme. Proteolytic cleavage of this loop results in increase of the catalytic activity (Halleen et al., 1996; Marshall et al., 1997), may be due to a more accessible active-site. Other differences include insertions in the loop regions between b1 and a1, b11 and b12, and a deletion in the loop between b3 and a3 in the rat enzyme. Also, the conformation of the loop between b2 and a2 is different, probably because of packing interactions with the N-terminal domain of this loop in the plant enzyme. Invariant residues in the purple acid phosphatases group in three clusters (Figure 7). One such cluster is found at the active-site. The ligands to the di-iron center are completely conserved in all the purple acid phosphatases of known sequence, and the geometry of the iron centers is very similar in the rat and plant enzyme. However, for the plant enzyme, the m-(hydr)oxo ligand and additional solvent ligands were implicated based on spectroscopy rather than direct observations in the electron density map, probably due to limited resolution (Klabunde et al., 1996). Another group contains predominantly hydrophobic residues that are part of the central core of

143 1995). Second, there is a body of spectroscopic evidence to suggest that there is a m-hydroxo bridge in the reduced, active di-iron cluster (David & Que 1990; Scarrow et al., 1990). Spectroscopy and kinetic analysis also suggested the presence of a hydroxyl ion or water molecule in the ®rst ligand sphere of the Fe(III) ion (Dietrich et al., 1991; Aquino et al., 1994). The crystal structure of rat acid phosphatase provides the ®rst crystallographic evidence that indeed a m-(hydr)oxo bridge is found in the metal cluster of this enzyme. In addition, electron density consistent with at least one water molecule or hydroxyl group at one of the iron ions has been observed. The X-ray structures of the plant enzyme with bound product, phosphate or the strong binding inhibitor tungstate (Klabunde et al., 1996) and EXAFS studies of the uteroferrin-phosphate complex (True et al., 1993) suggest that the product binds in a mode bridging both metal ions of the di-iron cluster. These data and the structure of rat purple acid phosphatase are consistent with the following mechanism (Figure 8), which in its overall outline follows the mechanism proposed for the plant enzyme (Klabunde et al., 1996). In the ®rst step of the reaction, the phosphate group of the substrate will bind to the reduced, active form of the enzyme with a coordination bond to the Fe(II) ion. This

the molecule. The last group of invariant residues contains the highly conserved sequence WLKKQL located on helix a5. The two lysine residues form a solvent-exposed positive patch at the protein surface with unknown function. In the crystal, a sulphate ion is bound in this region, interacting with the two lysine residues. A search of the protein data bank with the program TOP (Lu, 1996) using the atomic coordinates of rat TRAP as search model did not reveal signi®cant structural similarites to any other protein of known (and deposited) structure. Mechanistic implications Spectroscopic, crystallographic and other biochemical studies pose several constraints on any proposed catalytic reaction mechanism (Vincent et al., 1992; Klabunde et al., 1996). First, upon phosphoester hydrolysis, inversion of con®guration at the phosphorus atom has been observed (Mueller et al., 1993). This argues against the formation of a covalent phosphorylated intermediate, which had been implicated from studies with TRAP from bovine spleen (Vincent et al., 1991). Attempts to provide any evidence for the existence of phosphoenzyme intermediates in the reaction mechanism of uteroferrin were not successful (Wynne et al.,

Figure 8. Proposed mechanism for mammalian purple acid phosphatases.

144 places the hydroxyl ion in the ligand sphere of the Fe(III) ion in a position suitable for in-line attack on the phosphorus atom (Figure 8). Because the attack is delivered from the side opposite the alcohol group of the substrate, it will result in inversion of the con®guration at the phosphorus atom. The bound solvent molecule at the Fe(III) ion in the structure of the rat enzyme is in a position consistent with this proposal. The nucleophilic attack is facilitated (Klabunde et al., 1996) because (i) the ferric ion is a strong Lewis acid and will easily generate a nucleophilic hydroxide group from a water molecule bound in its ®rst ligand shell, (ii) Fe(II) also acts as a Lewis acid by withdrawing electrons from the phosphorus atom through its coordination with a phosphate oxygen atom, and ®nally (iii) the conserved histidine residues His113 and His216 in the activesite will enhance electron withdrawal from the phosphorus atom through stabilizition of the negative charge on the two phosphate oxygen atoms through hydrogen bonds and/or charge. The nucleophilic attack will result in a pentacoordinate transition state that might be stabilized by the two conserved histidine residues. Residue His296 of the plant enzyme (corresponding to His216 in rat TRAP) is suggested to act as a general acid that protonates the leaving group. In the purple acid phosphatases, there is a conserved aspartic acid residue, Asp267, in the vicinity of this conserved histidine residue. At the acidic pH optimum of the reaction it seems more likely that this aspartic acid residue rather than histidine acts as proton donor in leaving group protonation. In this respect, the mammalian enzymes would be similar to the high molecular mass acid phosphatases that also use an acidic group, a conserved aspartate residue, for leaving group protonation (Ostanin & van Etten, 1993; Porvari et al., 1994). In the ®nal catalytic step, the phosphate group, which is now bound in a bidentate binding mode to the iron cluster, can be displaced from the Fe(III) ion by a water molecule in a ligand substitution reaction (Figure 8). In all other enzyme families containing a m-oxo bridged di-iron center, this center is utilized for radical redox reactions catalyzed by these enzymes (Nordlund & Eklund, 1995). In the mechanism described above, the function of the metal ions is to act as Lewis acid and no radical chemistry is involved. It has been suggested that TRAP has a dual activity, as a phosphatase and as a source of hydroxyl radicals (Hayman & Cox, 1994) but the redox function of TRAP remains to be proven.

3D Structure of Bone Purple Acid Phosphatase

b-a-b-a-b core motif and a sequence ®ngerprint involved in metal binding. The structure determination of rat TRAP reveals that the core of the enzyme subunit is very similar in structure to the plant enzyme despite the lack of signi®cant overall sequence identity. The structure of the di-iron center is conserved in both enzyme species. The crystal structure suggests the presence of a m-(hydr)oxo ligand bridging the two metal ions. In addition, evidence for at least one hydroxyl or water ligand to one of the iron ions has been obtained. In the oxidized enzyme, the two metal ions are coordinated in an octahedral coordination geometry. The three-dimensional structure of mammalian TRAP will aid further biochemical and functional studies of these enzymes. For instance, site-directed mutagenesis studies can now be designed to address issues such as the properties and function of the metal center, active-site residues and substrate speci®city. There is strong evidence that the mammalian purple acid phosphatases expressed in bone are involved in bone resorption and knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of TRAP is therefore of considerable medical interest. TRAP activity has been found to correlate well with the degree of bone resorption in a number of pathological conditions with increased bone turnover. Increased levels of TRAP have also been noted in the serum and spleen of patients with Gaucher's desease, in circulating monocytes and spleen of patients with hairy cell leukemia and with other T and B-cell leukemias. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme provides a structural framework for the rational design of strong binding inhibitors as potential drugs for disorders with increased bone resorption.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection Recombinant rat TRAP was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system and the enzyme was crystallized with ammonium sulphate as precipitant as described (Kaija et al., 1999). Several thousand crystallization experiments resulted in four drops with tiny crystals, the largest crystal being about $30mm in size. Crystals of rat TRAP are of space group P212121 with cell Ê Ê Ê dimensions a  57.1 A, b  70.0 A and c  88.1 A (Kaija Ê et al., 1999). This gives a packing density of 2.55 A3/Da, consistent with one polypeptide chain per asymmetric unit. X-ray data on these crystals were collected at the microfocus beamline, ID13, at the ESRF in Grenoble. Before data collection, the crystals were transferred for several seconds into a cryo-solution consisting of mother liquor containing 20 % glycerol and were then moved into the cryo-stream at 100 K. Data were collected using an MAR image plate or CCD detector, respectively. Several crystals had to be used for data collection, since no crystal lasted for suf®cient time in the intense X-ray beam to give a complete data set. Images were processed with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) and the data were scaled using the program SCALA contained in the CCP4 suite

Conclusions
Mammalian purple acid phosphatases belong to the large class of metallophosphatases that includes Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, calcineurin, diadenosine tetraphosphatases and other phosphomonoesterases. These enzymes all share a common

3D Structure of Bone Purple Acid Phosphatase (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4, 1994). Details of the data collection statistics are given in Table 3. Structure determination and crystallographic refinement Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The coordinate set 4kbp for the red kidney bean TRAP (Klabunde et al., 1996) was used to construct a search model. This consisted of a polyalanine model of 183 core residues from the C-terminal catalytic domain, except that the side-chains were kept for residues known to be conserved between the two enzymes. The metal center was included in the search model. The rotation function was calculated using, in total, 36 combinations of different high and low-resolution cut-offs and radii, and the three highest peaks were saved from each run. These solutions were input to a translation search in the resolution interÊ val 15 to 2.8 A, which was performed for all possible combinations of screw axes in the primitive orthorhombic space group. After a crude elimination of peaks using the program PACMAN (Kleywegt, 1996), the remaining solutions were optimized using the ®t-option. Inspection then revealed that a solution above the noise level appeared only in spacegroup P212121. This solution had a correlation of 0.51 and an R-factor of 0.541 compared to 0.478 and 0.55 for the next peak, and showed reasonable packing in the crystal lattice. This model, with the metal ions excluded, was used to calculate an initial electron density map with SIGMAA (Read, 1986), which clearly showed high difference electron density at the expected metal positions, thus con®rming that the correct orientation of the model had been found. Then followed a long iterative process of extension of the model and re®nement. All data were used in the re®nement, no resolution or sigma cutoff were applied and all electron density maps were calculated using SIGMAA weighting (Read, 1986). Initially, re®nement was carried out using the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) including a bulk solvent correction, interspersed with inspection and correction of the model using O (Jones et al., 1991), OOPS (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996) and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). However, the R-free and R-factor stalled at about 0.48 and 0.42, respectively, until re®nement was continued using CNS È (Brunger et al., 1998). A slow-cool simulated annealing from 2500 K immediately lowered the R-free to 0.42 and from then on the iterative process converged rapidly; after three cycles the R-free decreased to 0.30 and after adding water, carbohydrates and all ions, the ®nal R-free and R-factor were 0.265 and 0.213, respectively. Anisotropic and bulk solvent corrections were applied and individual B-factors were re®ned. For details of the re®nement result and model statistics, see Table 1.

The structural model was analyzed using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Structural comparisons were carried out with the program O (Jones et al., 1991) and topology searches with the program TOP (Lu, 1996). Protein Data Bank accession codes The atomic coordinates and observed structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, accession codes 1qhw and r1qhwsf, respectively.
