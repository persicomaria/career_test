ABSTRACT Antibodies that recognize DNA (anti-DNA) are part of the autoimmune response underlying systemic lupus erythematosus. To better understand molecular recognition by anti-DNA antibodies, crystallographic studies have been performed using an anti-ssDNA antigen-binding fragment (Fab) known as DNA-1. The previously determined structure of a DNA-1/dT5 complex revealed that thymine bases insert into a narrow groove, and that ligand recognition primarily involves the bases of DNA. We now report the 1.75-Å resolution structure of DNA-1 complexed with the biological buffer HEPES (4-(2Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid). All three light chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and HCDR3 contribute to binding. The HEPES sulfonate hydrogen bonds to His L91, Asn L50, and to the backbone of Tyr H100 and Tyr H100A. The Tyr side-chains of L32, L92, H100, and H100A form nonpolar contacts with the HEPES ethylene and piperazine groups. Comparison to the DNA-1/dT5 structure reveals that the dual recognition of dT5 and HEPES requires a 13-Å movement of HCDR3. This dramatic structural change converts the combining site from a narrow groove, appropriate for the edge-on insertion of thymine bases, to one sufficiently wide to accommodate the HEPES sulfonate and piperazine. Isothermal titration calorimetry verified the association of HEPES with DNA-1 under conditions similar those used for crystallization (2 M ammonium sulfate). Interestingly, the presence of 2 M ammonium sulfate increases the affinities of DNA-1 for both HEPES and dT5, suggesting that non-polar Fab­ligand interactions are important for molecular recognition in highly ionic solvent conditions. The structural and thermodynamic data suggest a molecular mimicry mechanism based on structural plasticity and hydrophobic interactions. Proteins 2004;57:269 ­278. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: anti-DNA antibodies; X-ray crystallography; molecular mimicry; systemic lupus erythematosus; HEPES; isothermal titration calorimetry INTRODUCTION The autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by an aberrant immune response involving antibodies (Abs) directed against nuclear anti©

gens such as DNA, RNA, and nucleosomes.1,2 Anti-DNA Abs have received considerable attention because they directly contribute to the kidney inflammation associated with SLE, known as lupus nephritis. Several possible mechanisms for the involvement of anti-DNA Abs in lupus nephritis have been proposed, including binding of antiDNA Abs to DNA immobilized to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), nucleosome-mediated anti-DNA Ab deposition in the GBM, and cross-reaction of anti-DNA Abs with non-DNA glomerular components.2­10 Given the involvement of anti-DNA Abs in the pathogenesis of SLE, there is great interest in elucidating the structural basis of Ab-DNA recognition, in order to identify features of anti-DNA Abs responsible for pathogenicity.11,12 Such knowledge would undoubtedly contribute to a better molecular-level understanding of the role of anti-DNA Abs in SLE pathogenesis, thereby facilitating the development of SLE-specific drugs.13,14 X-ray crystallography is central to this effort because high resolution structures of anti-DNA Abs complexed with DNA or other ligands provide templates for the design of novel SLE therapeutics that inhibit or disrupt the interactions between pathogenic anti-DNA Abs and self-antigens. Given the potential of structure-based drug design, it is surprising that only two anti-DNA Abs have been characterized by high-resolution crystallographic analysis, namely, antigen-binding fragment (Fab) BV04-01, and the subject of this work, Fab DNA-1. The crystal structures of BV04-01, with and without bound d(pT)3, were determined in the early 1990s15; and the structure of DNA-1 complexed with dT5 was elucidated a decade later.16 Determination of the DNA-1/dT5 structure was a significant advance in the anti-DNA field, allowing for the first time, comparison of two Fab/oligonucleotide complex structures.

This comparison led to the identification of a common ssDNA recognition motif having three components: a Tyr side-chain at light (L) chain position L32, a polar sidechain at residue L91 (Ser or His), and an aromatic residue (Tyr or Trp) from the tip of HCDR3.16 The aromatic residues from L32 and HCDR3 stack above and below the thymine base, which perfectly positions the base to form hydrogen bonds with L91. The presence of these Fab­DNA interactions in both structures suggested to us that this triad of residues is an important structural determinant of Ab­ssDNA recognition.16 As part of our ongoing studies of anti-DNA Ab structure and function, we now report the crystal structure of Fab DNA-1 complexed with the biological buffer molecule HEPES (4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid). DNA-1 is a recombinant anti-ssDNA Fab that was isolated from a combinatorial bacteriophage display library of IgG fragments derived from the immunoglobulin repertoire of an autoimmune SLE-like MRL/lpr mouse.17 This Fab displays a strong preference for binding thyminerich ssDNA ligands with no detectable binding to dsDNA.18,19 DNA-1 is very similar to 11F820 ­22 in terms of CDR sequence, binding thermodynamics, and base preference. This relationship is significant because 11F8 is pathogenic based on the observation that it localizes to kidney tissue by binding to DNA adherent to the GBM.6 While it remains to be seen whether DNA-1 also displays pathogenic behavior, the similarities to 11F8 suggest that crystallographic studies of DNA-1 will likely provide insights into how a pathogenic anti-DNA Ab recognizes ligands. The DNA-1/HEPES crystal structure reported here reveals that HEPES binds in the previously characterized dT5 binding site, and that several of the residues responsible for dT5 recognition also participate in binding HEPES. Large conformational changes in HCDR3 allow DNA-1 to bind, separately, ssDNA and HEPES. These results illustrate the structural plasticity of the DNA-1 Fab, demonstrating the dramatic rearrangement of an anti-DNA combining site to accommodate a non-DNA ligand. This finding implies a major role for protein flexibility in anti-DNA Ab cross-reactivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection The details of recombinant protein expression and purification have been reported elsewhere.23 The crystal used for data collection was grown in a sitting drop at 22°C over a reservoir of 0.1 M HEPES, 1.85 M ammonium sulfate, 2% PEG 400, pH 8.1. The sitting drop was formed by mixing equal volumes of the reservoir and a stock solution of 18 mg/mL Fab DNA-1 in 10 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM NaCl (pH 7.0). The space group is P21212 with cell dimensions a 107.7 Å, b 156.7 Å, c 61.0 Å, and the asymmetric unit contains two Fabs with a solvent content of 51%. The crystal was prepared for cryogenic X-ray data collection by replacing the mother liquor with solutions of the harvest buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 2M ammonium sulfate, 2% PEG 400, pH 8.0) supplemented with increasing

amounts of glycerol. The glycerol concentration was raised from zero to 30% in increments of 5% over a period of about 10 min, and then the crystal was plunged into liquid nitrogen. The frozen crystal was transported to the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory for data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.75-Å resolution at beamline X8C. A scan of 108° of data was collected using a Quantum 4 CCD detector with an oscillation angle of 0.5°, an exposure time of 3.67 min per degree of oscillation, a detector distance of 130 mm, and a detector 2 angle of zero. The data were integrated with HKL2000 and merged with HKL.24 The reflection intensities were converted to amplitudes with the method of French and Wilson25 as implemented in CCP4.26 See Table I for data collection statistics. Molecular Replacement, Model Building, and Refinement Molecular replacement calculations were performed with AMoRe27 using a search model extracted from the previously solved structure of Fab DNA-1 bound to dT5 (PDB entry 1I8M).16 A clear solution for two Fabs in the asymmetric unit was identified, with a correlation coefficient of 63.3% and an R-factor of 0.41. Following molecular replacement, rigid body refinement was performed using CNS.28 In preparation for positional refinement and model building sessions in O,29 the CDR loops were omitted from the model. The Engh and Huber force field30 and the maximum likelihood amplitude target were used in CNS refinement. Prior to each round of CNS refinement, an overall anisotropic B-value correction was applied to the data and a bulk solvent correction was calculated. Simulated annealing was used in the first round of refinement, and conjugate gradient minimization was used in subsequent rounds. Individual atomic B-factor refinement was performed after positional refinement. Cross validation was used with a randomly chosen test set of 9796 reflections and a working set of 88,140 reflections. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not used in refinement due to the high resolution of the data. The CDR loops were gradually built as the quality of the maps improved. Once the protein structure was nearly complete and the R-factor dropped below 0.28, water molecules were added using the automated water picking routine of CNS. Water sites were filled if they displayed at least a 3 peak in the Fo­Fc map and possessed good hydrogen bonding. Water molecules were inspected after refinement, and they were deleted if they displayed weak or nonspherical 2Fo­Fc density viewed at the 1 level. Close inspection of the electron density resulted in the incorporation of nine sulfate ions, two HEPES molecules, six PEG fragments, and sixteen glycerol molecules. The occupancies of the two HEPES molecules and the two sulfate ions bound to the CDRs were estimated from alternating cycles of B-factor and occupancy refinement, using the method suggested by Jensen.31 These calculations resulted in occupancy values of 0.95 for the two HEPES molecules, 0.91 for the sulfate ion bound to Fab 1,

and 0.87 for the sulfate ion bound to Fab 2. These results suggest that the HEPES and sulfate ligands are present at nearly unit occupancy. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB32 as entry 1P7K. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Anticipating a low affinity interaction between HEPES and DNA-1, the competition-based ITC method described by Zhang and Zhang was used to measure the association constant and enthalpy of HEPES binding to DNA-1.33 Basically, the binding of a high-affinity ligand (dT5 in this case) is monitored in the absence and presence of the low-affinity ligand (HEPES in this case). The binding parameters for the low-affinity ligand are then extracted from the resulting data sets with the following equations,33 K HEP H HEP (K dT5/K app 1)/[HEP] tot H app)(1 1/K HEP/[HEP] tot) (1) (2)

( H dT5

where KdT5 and Kapp are the association constants for the binding of dT5 to DNA-1 in the absence and presence of

HEPES, respectively, HdT5 and Happ are the enthalpies for dT5 binding to DNA-1 in the absence and presence of HEPES, respectively, and [HEP]tot is the total concentration of HEPES present in the second titration. This method is appropriate because our crystal structures have established that HEPES and dT5 compete for the same binding site. All ITC experiments were performed in a MicroCal VP-ITC at 25°C. The dT5 was purchased from either Sigma-Genosys (HPLC purified) or Integrated DNA Technologies (standard desalting preparation) and used without further purification. For each titration, DNA-1, at a concentration of 0.03 mM, was placed in the calorimeter cell, and dT5 (1.2­1.3 mM) was added to the cell via the rotating stirrer-syringe. Four titrations were performed, corresponding to the following buffers: (1) 0.01 M imidazole, 0.1 M NaCl (pH 7.0); (2) 0.01 M imidazole, 0.1 M Na HEPES (pH 7.0); (3) 0.01 M imidazole, 0.1 M NaCl (pH 7.0), 2 M (NH4)2SO4; (4) 0.01 M imidazole, 0.1 M Na HEPES (pH 7.0), 2 M (NH4)2SO4. Prior to each titration, separate solutions of ligand and protein were dialyzed exhaustively into the same buffer. The two (NH4)2SO4

buffers were titrated to pH 7.0 before adding (NH4)2SO4. Values of the association constant and enthalpy were obtained by fitting the integrated heats of association to the one-site binding model using the software supplied with the instrument. The results were corrected for the heat of mixing and ligand dilution, which was measured for each titration by injecting dT5 (1.3 mM) into the appropriate buffer devoid of protein. RESULTS Description of the Overall Structure and Nomenclature The Fab crystal structure presented here was determined using a 1.75-Å resolution X-ray diffraction data set collected from a single crystal using synchrotron radiation. Thus, it is the highest-resolution anti-DNA Fab structure solved to date and provides our most accurate view so far of an anti-DNA Ab combining site. The electron density was of exceptional quality (Fig. 1) and allowed unambiguous modeling of the entire protein main-chain except for heavy (H) chain residues 127­133, which are disordered in many Fab structures, including the DNA/dT5 structure.16 The R-factor for the refined model is 0.197, with an R-free34 (10% test set) of 0.230. A Luzzati plot35 suggests a mean positional error of 0.21 Å, while the A error estimate36 is 0.19 Å. The structure exhibits good stereochemical quality that is consistent with 1.75-Å resolution data (Table I), and it meets or exceeds all main-chain and side-chain tests of PROCHECK.37 The asymmetric unit contains two Fabs (Fab 1 and Fab 2), with the light (L) and heavy (H) chains denoted L and H in Fab 1, and A and B in Fab 2. The residue-numbering scheme and CDR definitions follow the standard Kabat conventions.38,39 Both Fabs display the expected immunoglobulin fold in which each of the four homology subunits, denoted VH, VL, CH1, and CL, consists of two twisted, antiparallel sheets packed tightly against each other.40,41 The two Fab structures are very similar to each other in terms of both the polypeptide conformation throughout the

Fabs and the quaternary structure. The root mean square difference (RMSD) between the two Fabs, after superimposing the main-chains, is 0.41 Å for the main-chain and 0.52 Å for all atoms. The RMSD for the VH/VL superdomain is 0.32 Å for the main-chain and 0.44 Å for all atoms, while the analogous values for the CH1/CL superdomain are 0.39 Å for the main-chain and 0.51 Å for all atoms. The two Fabs have similar elbow angles (168°, 171°). Fab­Ligand Interactions The original goal of the present study was to elucidate a structure of the unliganded Fab, and so ssDNA was not added to the protein solution prior to crystallization. However, electron density maps clearly indicated the presence of two small molecule ligands bound to the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) near the previously established oligo(dT) binding sites of both Fabs (Fig. 1). The excellent quality of the 1.75-Å resolution maps allowed us to assign these features to a molecule of the zwitterionic buffer HEPES and to a sulfate ion. Note that the crystallization reservoir contained 0.1 M HEPES and approximately 2 M (NH4)2SO4 and that equal amounts of the protein stock solution and reservoir were mixed to form sitting drops for crystallization. It is possible that the bound sulfate ion could represent the sulfonate group of a second HEPES molecule, based on the presence of weak electron density connected to the modeled sulfate ion. However, the density was not sufficiently convincing to support inclusion of a second HEPES and was therefore modeled as a sulfate ion instead. The HEPES and sulfate ligands were found in both Fabs, and the protein­ligand interactions were nearly identical in both Fabs. Thus, the discussion below will be restricted to Fab 1. The HEPES molecule binds in a pocket formed by all three L chain CDRs and HCDR3 (Fig. 2). The total surface area buried in the Fab/HEPES interface is 537 Å2, with the protein and HEPES contributing 269 Å2 and 268 Å2, respectively.42 The burial of 268 Å2 of surface area by HEPES amounts to 64% of its total solvent accessible surface area. The L and H chains contribute almost equally to the protein side of the interface. LCDR1 and LCDR3 account for 16% and 37% of the protein side of the interface, respectively. HCDR3 contributes 47% of the

protein side of the interface. Although the surface area analysis suggests that LCDR2 does not participate in the binding of HEPES, Asn L50 of LCDR2 contributes a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the HEPES sulfonate (see discussion below). The HEPES sulfonate binds in a pocket located at the intersection of LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3, and HCDR3. The sulfonate accepts two hydrogen bonds from the side-chain of His L91, and two hydrogen bonds from the backbone N-H groups of Tyr H100 and Tyr H100A (Fig. 3). The ionization state of His L91 appears to be neutral rather than cationic because an imidazole N atom of His 91 is perfectly positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from the backbone N-H of Asn L50 (NE2-N distance of 3.1 Å). Thus, the interaction between His L91 and the sulfonate is probably a hydrogen bond rather than an ion pair. Asn L50 participates in the stabilization of HEPES by forming a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the sulfonate (Fig. 3). The density representing this water molecule is quite strong (Fig. 1), and the refined B-value of 23 Å2 is well below the average solvent B-value of 39 Å2, which indicates that this water-mediated hydrogen bond is a significant interaction. While the sulfonate binding pocket appears to be the main recognition locus, there are many nonpolar and polar interactions formed between the Fab and the nonsulfonate parts of the HEPES. These other interactions distinguish HEPES from a sulfate ion, and the binding of HEPES, present at 0.1 M, in the presence of 2 M sulfate ion, attests to their importance. These interactions with the nonsulfonate moieties include several nonpolar protein­ligand contacts help stabilize the bound HEPES by providing shape complementarity and favorable van der Waals interactions. For example, the ethylene linker between the sulfonate and piperazine groups contacts side-chain C atoms of Tyr H100 and Tyr H100A, while the piperazine contacts C atoms of Tyr H100A, Tyr L32, and Tyr L92 (Fig. 3). The piperazine ring adopts a chair conformation, with the

carbonyl bond of Tyr L92 oriented perpendicular to the face of the piperazine ring (Fig. 3). This arrangement brings the carbonyl O atom within 2.8 Å of the piperazine N2. Thus, there appears to be a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl and the piperazine N2, with the latter presumably protonated. Finally, the HEPES hydroxyl forms three hydrogen bonds to a sulfate ion (possibly the sulfonate of a second HEPES) that is also bound by the Fab. The sulfate forms an ion pair with Lys H58 of HCDR2, and it hydrogen bonds to Thr L94 and Tyr H100A (Fig. 3). The average B-factor of the HEPES is 38 Å2 with the HEPES sulfonate having an average B-factor of only 26 Å2. In contrast, the B-factor of the bound sulfate ion is higher, 43 Å2. Comparison to the DNA-1/dT5 Structure The structure of DNA-1 complexed to the ssDNA ligand dT5 was previously determined at 2.1 Å resolution.16 The dT5 ligand binds in a narrow groove formed by all three L chain CDRs and HCDR3, and most of the Fab­DNA interactions involve the bases of the second and third nucleotides (T2 and T3) of the dT5 ligand. On the protein side, the important residues are Tyr L32, Tyr L49, Asn L50, His L91, Tyr L92, Tyr H100, and Tyr H100A (Fig. 4). These Tyr side-chains line the binding groove and form van der Waals interactions with the thymine bases. The base of T2 is sandwiched between the aromatic rings of Tyr L32 and Tyr H100, while His L91 hydrogen bonds to a carbonyl of the T2 thymine base. Similarly, the base of T3 is sandwiched between the side-chains of Tyr L49 and Tyr H100A, and the base hydrogen bonds to the backbone of Ala H100B. Asn L50 provides the lone interaction with the DNA backbone by hydrogen-bonding to the phosphate moiety between T2 and T3. Importantly, the triad of L32, L91, and H100 has been hypothesized to be particularly important for ssDNA­antibody recognition, based on its

274

or between Tyr L49 and Tyr H100A. This groove, however, is too narrow for the sulfonate group of HEPES, thus necessitating a conformational change in the protein. The structural rearrangement of HCDR3 widens the T2 binding site by 2­3 Å, which creates a pocket big enough for the sulfonate. Another consequence of the HCDR3 movement is that the T3 site is occluded because of the movement of Pro H99 into van der Waals contact with Tyr H49 (Fig. 3). Thus, the ability of DNA-1 to recognize both oligo(dT) and HEPES is critically dependent on the flexibility of HCDR3. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry The discovery of a HEPES molecule bound to DNA-1 in the crystal structure prompted us to examine the binding of HEPES to DNA-1 in solution using ITC. Anticipating a low affinity interaction, competition ITC experiments were used to measure the apparent affinity of DNA-1 for a high-affinity ligand, dT5, in the absence and presence of 0.1 M Na HEPES. Figure 6(a) shows the results for a titration performed in 0.01 M imidazole, 0.1 M NaCl (pH 7.0). The apparent association constant, obtained by fitting the integrated heats of injection to the one-site binding model, is KA 6.0 104 M 1 (Table II). This value agrees well with that measured previously using fluorescence quenching under similar buffer conditions (KA 3.7 104).43 The binding of dT5 to DNA-1 is exothermic, with an apparent Hcal under our solution conditions of 16.8 kcal/mol. Although the calorimetric enthalpy had not been previously measured, an estimate of the van't Hoff enthalpy ( 25 kcal/mol, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0) had been extracted previously from fluorescence quenching data for the binding of dT5 to DNA-1.19 Thus, our ITC data display reasonable agreement with existing thermodynamic data for DNA-1. The effect of HEPES on the binding of dT5 to DNA-1 is shown in Figure 6(b). The conditions of this titration were identical to those of Figure 6(a), except that 0.1 M Na HEPES was substituted for 0.1 M NaCl in the buffers used for both the dT5 and DNA-1 solutions. The presence of HEPES caused a slight decrease in the affinity constant, to KA 4.9 104 M 1, and a slight lowering of the enthalpy to 18.5 kcal/mol. Using Equations (1) and (2), the thermodynamic parameters for HEPES binding to DNA-1 are KA 2.4 M 1 and H 8.7 kcal/mol. Note that the enthalpy of HEPES binding to DNA-1 in low salt conditions is endothermic. ITC experiments were also performed in the presence of 2 M (NH4)2SO4, in order to mimic the conditions used for crystallization. These results are shown in Figure 7. Surprisingly, the presence of 2 M (NH4)2SO4 increased the affinity of DNA-1 for dT5 twofold, to KA 1.3 105 M 1 [Fig. 7(a); Table II]. In addition, the presence of (NH4)2SO4 increased the exothermicity of the binding to H 21.4 kcal/mol [Fig. 7(a); Table II]. The ITC results performed in the presence of both 2 M (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 M Na HEPES are shown in Figure 7(b). From Equations (1) and (2), the thermodynamic parameters for HEPES binding to DNA-1 in the presence of 2 M (NH4)2SO4 are KA 5.7 M 1 and H 7.0 kcal/mol (Table II). As with dT5, the presence of

appearance in both the BV04-01/ d(pT)3 and DNA-1/dT5 structures.16 The HEPES and dT5 binding sites of DNA-1 are remarkably similar in terms of CDR usage and the identities of residues that contact the ligands, despite the obvious chemical and structural differences between the two ligands. For example, in both the DNA-1/dT5 and DNA-1/ HEPES structures, the ligand-binding site consists of residues from all three L chain CDRs plus HCDR3, with no contributions from HCDR1. The side-chains of Tyr L32, Tyr L92, Tyr H100, and Tyr H100A line both binding sites. These aromatic rings in both complexes help to align the ligand in the binding site so that Asn L50 and His L91 can hydrogen-bond to the ligand. Finally, note that the critical triad of Tyr L32, His L91, and Tyr H100 is used for ligand recognition in both structures. Despite the aforementioned similarities, the dT5 and HEPES binding sites differ in terms of shape and size, and these important differences are due to large conformational changes in HCDR3. The RMSD between the HCDR3 loops of the DNA-1/dT5 and DNA-1/HEPES structures is 2.2 Å for the main-chain and 4.4 Å for all atoms (following superposition of the HCDR3 main-chain). For reference, the main-chain RMSD for the entire VH/VL superdomain is only 0.8 Å, while the main-chain RMSDs for the other five CDRs are less than 0.7 Å. The largest conformational differences in HCDR3 involve Pro H99, Tyr H100, and Tyr H100A, which are located in the tip of the loop (Fig. 5). The conformational change in HCDR3 results in movements of 10 Å for Pro H99 (based on the CG atom), 4 Å for Tyr H100 (based on the hydroxyl), and 13 Å for Tyr H100A (based on the hydroxyl). The structural changes of HCDR3 modify the size and shape of the binding site to match the size and shape requirements of the ligand. In the DNA-1/dT5 complex, the binding site is a narrow groove, just wide enough to accommodate the edge-on insertion of thymine bases T2 and T3 (Fig. 4). The width is 7 Å, as measured by the distance between the side-chains of Tyr 32 and Tyr H100,

Note also that 2 M (NH4)2SO4 decreased the apparent enthalpy of HEPES binding to DNA-1 and that the association is now exothermic with an unfavorable entropy change (Table II). DISCUSSION This paper reports the first crystal structure of an anti-DNA Fab complexed with a non-DNA ligand. Together with the DNA-1/dT5 structure, the current structure provides a three-dimensional framework for understanding cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry in the context of anti-DNA Abs. Several studies have reported the binding of non-DNA ligands to anti-DNA Abs, including anionic dyes,44 benzodiazepines,7 pneumococcal polysaccharide,45 phosphorylcholine,45,46 the protein -actinin,47 acidic pentapeptides,48 the NR2 glutamate receptor,49 Cys-constrained 16-mer peptides,50 histones,50 and nucleosomes.2,50 Thus, the ability to recognize multiple ligands is a hallmark of anti-DNA Abs. Molecular mimicry is one mechanism by which autoimmune diseases can occur in association with infectious agents.51 This idea presumes that foreign antigens trigger an immune response, and that the antibodies produced cross-react with host molecules that are structurally and chemically similar to the triggering antigen. For example, in the case of SLE pathogenesis, phosphorylcholine (PC), a component of pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide, has been proposed as a triggering antigen, with the phosphate moiety of PC presumably mimicking the phosphate backbone of self-antigen DNA.46,52,53 The work presented here affords an opportunity to examine how an anti-DNA Ab recognizes similar features on different molecules, which is germane to the notions of cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry. HEPES contains a sulfonate group, analogous to the phosphate group of the DNA backbone. Based on the simple notion of molecular mimicry, one would predict these two groups to form similar interactions with the Fab. The sulfonate hydrogenbonds to His L91, the main-chain of H100 and H100A, and to a water molecule. The major interaction partner with the sulfonate appears to be His L91 (Fig. 3). This residue hydrogen bonds to a thymine base in the DNA-1/dT5 structure; it makes no interactions with the DNA backbone (Fig. 4). Thus, molecular mimicry based on the similarity of sulfonate to the phosphate of DNA does not explain the recognition of HEPES by DNA-1. On the other hand, both DNA-1 structures show a hydrophobic ring of the ligand bound between Tyr side-chains (Figs. 3, 4),

which suggests a molecular mimicry mechanism based on hydrophobic interactions rather than ionic interactions. It is significant that Tyr L32, His L91, and Tyr H100 participate directly in the recognition of HEPES. These residues are also very important for binding oligo(dT), based on the crystal structures of DNA-1/dT5 and BV0401/ d(pT)3. This triad of residues, therefore, possibly form a ligand recognition "hot spot," rather than a ssDNA-specific recognition motif, as was proposed earlier.16 Future structural and mutagenesis studies of Fab DNA-1 will test this hypothesis. The DNA-1/HEPES structure provides a basis for interpreting early work that examined the binding of low molecular weight anionic compounds to anti-DNA Abs.44 Several organic compounds, such as synthetic dyes like acid magenta, FD and C Green No. 3, and methyl blue, were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of Escherichia coli native DNA to the NZB/NZW monoclonal anti-DNA Ab A52, which binds both ssDNA and dsDNA. Interestingly, only compounds displaying an anionic functional group inhibited DNA association. Moreover, the best inhibitors featured a sulfonate group bound to a six-membered aromatic ring. It is tempting to think that these anionic inhibitors might bind to A52 in a way that is analogous to the binding of HEPES to DNA-1. This notion is supported by sequence analysis. The A52 L chain contains, like DNA-1, Tyr L32, His L91, and Tyr L92. In addition, HCDR3 of A52 features two contiguous aromatic residues (Tyr and Phe) that are analogous to Tyr H100 and Tyr H100A of DNA-1. Thus, A52 possesses most of the side-chains that DNA-1 uses to bind the sulfonate-containing ligand HEPES, and it is therefore reasonable to think that the structure presented here provides a plausible model of the A52/ligand complexes previously studied. The ITC data presented here confirm the binding of HEPES to DNA-1 in solution, although the affinity is rather low. It is interesting that the presence of 2 M (NH4)2SO4 enhanced the binding of both HEPES and dT5 to DNA-1. These results suggest that nonpolar Fab­ligand interactions are important for molecular recognition in highly ionic solvent conditions. This picture is consistent with the structure presented here, which shows the HEPES ligand making significant nonpolar contacts with Tyr side-chains (Fig. 3). It is also consistent with the structure of DNA-1 complexed with dT5, which was determined from crystals grown in 2 M (NH4)2SO4 .16 The DNA-1/dT5 structure shows thymine bases sandwiched by Tyr side-chains, resulting in the burial of significant nonpolar surface area (Fig. 4). The binding of HEPES to DNA-1 is reminiscent of the recent work by Stevens, Schultz, and coworkers, in which a crystallization component, jeffamine, unexpectedly bound the germline precursor to antibody 7G12.54 The resulting Fab/jeffamine complex provided insight into how somatic mutations optimize the binding site by the reducing the structural plasticity that is necessary for binding diverse, nonhapten ligands. Similarly, we find that structural plasticity underlies the ability of DNA-1 to recognize different ligands.

Finally, the large conformational changes observed in HCDR3 suggest it is highly unlikely that theoretical modeling will provide reliable three-dimensional models of anti-DNA combining sites. Current modeling programs would certainly not have predicted the DNA-1/HEPES structure from the DNA-1/dT5 structure, much less from sequence information alone. Thus, there remains a pressing need for more crystal structures of anti-DNA Abs. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Season P.
