Abstract Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of carnobacteriocin B2 (CbnB2), a structurally well-characterized class IIa bacteriocin, and its immunity protein (ImB2) in lipid bilayer environment have been conducted to explore the interaction between them. Six 30-ns simulations were conducted in DPPC or POPG bilayer systems. In these simulations, ImB2 was placed in the aqueous layer with different orientations facing CbnB2 to sample all the faces of ImB2. The MD results indicate that (i) while CbnB2 remained embedded in the bilayer, it tends to move toward the interface, and (ii) the presence of CbnB2 in the DPPC bilayer attracts ImB2 toward the bilayer. In one of the orientations in DPPC bilayer system (simulation 1), ImB2 penetrates the bilayer and interacts with CbnB2 by ion-pair interaction. At several instances toward the later half of the simulation (15­30 ns), ImB2 and CbnB2 were found to form salt-bridge between Arg95 of ImB2 and Glu24 of CbnB2. Simulation in POPG bilayer displayed strong interaction between the positively charged ImB2 and the negatively charged polar head groups of the POPG molecules at the lipid­water interface. However, ImB2 was not able to penetrate the bilayer thereby preventing any interaction between ImB2 and CbnB2. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Class IIa bacteriocins, produced by lactic acid bacteria, are potent antimicrobial peptides which are active against closely related Gram-positive bacteria [1­3]. These peptides are cationic, heat stable, and typically have 37­48 amino acid residues. The N-terminus contains a conserved YGNGVXC motif, of which, the cysteine forms a disulfide bond with another cysteine from the N-terminal region. More than 20 such peptides have been identified that present high sequence

homology (between 40 and 90%), but differ markedly in their target cell specificity. The solution structures of four class IIa bacteriocins, namely leucocin A [4], CbnB2 [5], sakacin P [6] and curvacin A [7] have been reported. These three-dimensional structures have been utilized for modeling the structure of other bacteriocins of this class [8]. These studies, along with numerous reports on structure­activity relationships, suggest that the amphipathic C-terminal helix is critical for antimicrobial activity and determines the target cell specificity [9,10]. Recent studies on the mechanism of action of these peptides point out the involvement of a specific membrane receptor protein, namely, one or more proteins from the mannose phosphotransferase system on the target cell [11­13]. Producer strains are protected against the effects of their bacteriocins by cognate immunity proteins that are coexpressed with a gene encoding the bacteriocins [14­16]. The primary structure of about 17 immunity proteins of class IIa bacteriocins have been reported. In contrast to the bacteriocins, the amino acid sequences of the immunity proteins are generally much less homologous (between 5 and 85%). These proteins typically

consist of 88­115 amino acids residues, and display a high degree of specificity with respect to the bacteriocin they recognize. The three-dimensional structure of two immunity proteins has been determined. Structure of immunity protein to CbnB2 has been solved by NMR spectroscopy [17], whereas the structure of immunity protein to enterocin A has been determined by X-ray crystallography [18]. The three-dimensional structures of both the immunity proteins show that they are globular proteins consisting of four- or five-helix bundles that fold around a hydrophobic core. Although the two immunity proteins display low sequence similarity (13%), they display common three-dimensional structural features. Immunity proteins of class IIa bacteriocins are located intracellularly (cytoplasm), with a small proportion ( 1%) being associated with the cell membrane [16,19]. A recent report suggests that the C-terminal half of the immunity protein contains a region that is involved in the specific recognition of the bacteriocin to which it confers immunity [10]. The experiments conducted in this study show that the hybrid immunity proteins containing N- and C-terminal regions from different immunity proteins conferred immunity primarily against the bacteriocin which belonged to the C-terminal region of the immunity protein. Based on these results and several other reports, it has been proposed that the C-terminal halves of the immunity protein directly or indirectly interact with the Cterminal domain of cognate bacteriocins [17,20]. Several attempts, including HSQC NMR experiments, to observe direct interaction between the bacteriocin and its immunity protein have showed no significant interaction [17]. The NMR experiments involved titration of [15N]ImB2 with 1.5 molar equivalent of CbnB2 in aqueous buffer. ImB2 displays a welldefined structure in water, however CbnB2 is essentially unstructured in water and assumes a defined conformation only in trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking environments [5]. Thus, although it has not been possible to show a direct bacteriocin-immunity protein interaction, the data do not strictly preclude such interaction at the cell membrane. A direct interaction may occur after the bacteriocin becomes membranebound and thereby structured. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be potential tools for studying the interaction between two biomolecules in different solvent systems. MD simulations have been frequently used to study protein or protein­ligand dynamics in aqueous environment [21­23]. Recently MD simulations have also been used to study the dynamics of membrane proteins in membrane mimicking solvents, micelles, and lipid bilayer systems [24­ 26]. Further, Spijker et al. studied the dynamics of 2adrenergic receptor (2AR) protein bound to epinephrine (endogenous agonist) and butoxamine (selective antagonist) in a hydrated bilayer system [27]. In the present study, we have used MD simulations to investigate any possible interaction between CbnB2 and its immunity protein (ImB2). We have set up a system combining the aqueous and lipid environments to study possible interaction between a cytoplasmic protein (ImB2) and a peptide (CbnB2) that gets structured in membrane environment at the lipid­water interface. The exact nature of interaction of class IIa bacteriocins with the membrane is not yet

clear. Some studies suggest that the charged residues from the N-terminal region, central amphiphathic helix, and the Cterminal region are present at the bilayer­water interface, while hydrophobic residues are buried in the bilayer [7,28,29]. It is worth noting that several studies found the bacteriocins to be unstructured in an aqueous environment, while they retain their structure in membrane mimicking environments [4­8,29]. If the structure of the bacteriocins is relevant to their specific interactions with the immunity proteins, it is discernable that these molecules must remain closely associated with the lipid bilayer. In other words, the bacteriocins are either completely embedded in the bilayer structure, or are bound to the surface of the bilayer to be active. Mechanistic insight regarding the interaction of bacteriocin with the bilayer and the immunity protein could be gained by systematic MD simulations. In the present study, we have placed CbnB2 in the bilayer and ImB2 in the aqueous layer in different orientations with respect to CbnB2. Six independent CbnB2­ImB2 simulations, each of 30 ns duration, were conducted with CbnB2 embedded in the bilayer made of DPPC or POPG molecules and ImB2 in the aqueous layer in a periodic box. The results from these simulations suggest that CbnB2 and its immunity protein exhibit some weak interactions with each other at the cell surface when CbnB2 is initially embedded in the core of the bilayer. The specific domains and amino acid residues that might be involved in this interaction are discussed.
2. Methods 2.1. Peptide structure
CbnB2 or any bacteriocin and immunity protein are referred to as "peptide" in this report and the interaction between them will be referred to as "peptide­ peptide" interaction. The three dimensional coordinates based on NMR solution structures of CbnB2 and its immunity protein (ImB2) were obtained from the protein data bank, PDB codes 1CW5 and 1TDP, respectively [5,17]. CbnB2 is a small 48-residue cationic peptide that forms a stable secondary structure in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol or detergent micelles but is essentially unstructured in water. The starting structure of CbnB2 used in this study corresponds to the solution structure of CbnB2 (pdb code 1CW5) in TFE-d3/H2O (9:1)pH 2.8 [5]. CbnB2 folds into a well-defined central helical structure (residues 18­39) and disordered N and C termini forming mainly a coil structure as shown in Fig. 1. The N-terminus contains a conserved disulfide bond between Cys9 and Cys14. The 111-residue immunity protein for carnobacterocin B2, ImB2, is a cationic peptide that forms a stable structure in aqueous solution. The ImB2 coordinates, pdb code 1TDP, correspond to the NMR solution structure in 98% D2O/2% H2O mixture [17]. The three dimensional structure, as shown in Fig. 1, displays the secondary structural elements of ImB2 that mainly consists of an antiparallel four-helix bundle and a fifth helix in the C terminal. The four helix bundle folds to form an interior hydrophobic core, while the charged and hydrophilic residues are present at the exterior. The fifth helix is held across the four-helix bundle by hydrophobic interactions of the side chains. Side chains of most of the charged and polar residues in ImB2 remain in contact with the solvent. The peptides were considered to have positively and negatively charged Nterminal NH+ and C-terminal COO- groups, respectively. Lys, Arg, Asp, and 3 Glu residues were considered to be charged, and His residue was kept neutral giving +4 and +3 charges to CbnB2 and ImB2, respectively.

was used to mimic the membrane environment. The PDB coordinates for the DPPC and POPG molecules were obtained from http://moose.bio.ucalgary.ca [30] and http://www.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Don/home.html [31], respectively. CbnB2, known to form stable secondary structure in membrane environment mimicking solvents, was embedded in the bilayer. The system was set up by placing CbnB2 with DPPC molecules arranged in a bilayer (49 per leaflet) in a 5.8 nm × 5.8 nm × 5.8 nm cubic box. CbnB2 was placed in the center of the bilayer, sandwiched between the two leaflets and perpendicular to the hydrophobic tail groups of lipid molecules. The starting configuration was generated by adding SPC water molecules on either side of the bilayer. Sufficient counterions were added to make the system electroneutral and to provide a final concentration of 25 mM NaCl. The box volume was 195 nm3, making the peptide concentration 8.5 mM. The simulations were conducted in two steps. In the first step, a 5 ns MD (simulation CbnPC, Table 1) was performed with CbnB2 in the DPPC bilayer. Similarly, a 5 ns MD (simulation ImW) was conducted by placing ImB2 in a box with water only. In the second step, the equilibrated CbnB2 and ImB2 were placed in a single periodic box with hydrated DPPC bilayer. The hydrated POPG simulation box was constructed similarly. Results from six 30-ns MD runs, simulations 1­5 employing a DPPC bilayer and 1PG employing a POPG bilayer, are reported here to elucidate the CbnB2­ImB2 interactions in the lipid bilayer system. The details of the periodic cell for each system, including the number of water molecules, lipids, and the initial box size, are listed in Table 1. For the ImB2­CbnB2 simulations (simulations 1­5) in DPPC bilayer, the box size was increased to 5.8 × 5.8 × 9.5 nm and ImB2 was inserted next to the bilayer Table 1 Details of MD simulations in the NPT ensemble Simulation name System a Spacing between peptides (nm) b Duration (ns)

prior to the addition of water molecules. ImB2 was positioned in five different orientations with respect to CbnB2 or the bilayer in the periodic box using SwissPdbViewer [32]. These starting orientations or initial configurations (0 ns) are (a) helix 5 of ImB2 at the interface and perpendicular to CbnB2 helix (simulation 1), (b) helix 5 of ImB2 at the interface and parallel to CbnB2 helix (simulation 2), (c) helix 1 of ImB2 at the interface and parallel to CbnB2 helix (simulation 3), (d) loop between helices 3 and 4 of ImB2 facing the CbnB2 helix (simulation 4), and (e) same orientation as simulation 2 but ImB2 is placed at the bottom of the bilayer (simulation 5). For the ImB2­CbnB2 simulation in POPG bilayer (simulation 1PG), orientation of ImB2 was same as in simulation 1 and the simulation box was constructed as described for the DPPC bilayer.

2.3. Simulation methods and parameters
MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS 3.2 simulation package and the GROMOS96 force field [33,34]. All systems were simulated in the isobaric­isothermal (NPT) ensemble at 300 K using periodic boundary conditions. Weak coupling of the proteins to a solvent bath of constant temperature was maintained using the Berendsen thermostat with a coupling constant T = 0.1 ps. The pressure was controlled using the Berendsen algorithm at 1 bar with a coupling constant P = 1 ps at 300 K. For all simulations, the neighbor list was updated every 10 steps, with a neighbor list cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. The Lennard­Jones interactions were truncated at a cutoff distance of 1.2 nm. The long-range electrostatic interactions were modeled using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation method with a cutoff distance of 1.2 nm for the real space. The integration time step was 2 fs, and the coordinates and

The system was energy minimized before the MD simulation using 200 steps of the steepest descent energy minimization method in order to relax any steric conflicts generated during the set-up. The equilibration of the CbnB2-bilayer­water system was achieved by performing a 3 ns MD run with positional restraint on the peptide molecule. Following this, a full MD run of 5 ns was performed without any restraints. The resulting configuration at 5 ns was extracted and used as the starting point for subsequent CbnB2­ImB2 simulations. All six CbnB2­ImB2 MD simulations (1­5, 1PG) were performed for 30 ns without any positional restraints. In addition, two more simulations with ImB2 alone in hydrated DPPC bilayer (simulation ImPC) or hydrated POPG bilayer (simulation ImPG) were conducted for 30 ns each. Simulations were analyzed using various GROMACS postprocessing routines. SwissPdbViewer [32] and ViewerLite 5.0 [36] were used to visualize and superimpose structures.

3. Results Our primary goal is to investigate any direct interaction between a class IIa bacteriocin, CbnB2, and its immunity protein ImB2. Representative results of the MD simulations with single or two peptide(s) in a periodic simulation box are presented. Single peptide simulations, namely, CbnB2 in hydrated bilayer (simulation CbnPC) and ImB2 in water (simulation ImW) or hydrated bilayer (simulations ImPC and ImPG), were conducted followed by six CbnB2­ImB2 simulations (simulations 1­5, and 1PG) in hydrated bilayer system (Table 1). The two single peptide simulations, namely CbnPC and ImW were conducted to monitor the stability of the peptide structure in the corresponding solvent systems. Single peptide simulations ImPC and ImPG, with ImB2 alone in hydrated bilayer system, were conducted to study the interaction between ImB2 and the zwitterionic or negatively charged bilayer, respectively. CbnB2­ImB2 simulations were performed to study the interaction between the two peptides. Five different orientations of ImB2 (in the water layer) facing CbnB2 (in lipid bilayer) that were studied (simulations 1­5) are described in Methods. These orientations allow all faces of ImB2 to be present at the interface between CbnB2 and ImB2. The interactions between the two peptides observed during 30 ns simulations in the lipid bilayer system are reported in this section. Furthermore, the effect of a negatively charged bilayer on the interaction between the two peptides is studied by performing CbnB2­ImB2 simulation in POPG bilayer system (simulation 1PG). 3.1. Peptide environment and orientation A 5-ns simulation of CbnB2 embedded in DPPC bilayer (simulation CbnPC) showed that the peptide structure remained intact in the membrane mimetic environment as monitored by RMSD and secondary structure (data not shown). Solution structure studies using NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations have shown that class IIa bacteriocins such as CbnB2 and leucocin A form stable structures in membrane mimicking solvents only and become unstructured in aqueous solutions [5,8]. The C-terminal region of CbnB2 forms an amphipathic helix and it is observed that at the end of the 5-ns simulation the polar face of CbnB2 has moved toward the phospholipid polar

heads (surface) of the bilayer while the hydrophobic face remains immersed in the bilayer. This equilibrated structure of CbnB2 in the hydrated bilayer was used to construct the periodic boxes for subsequent CbnB2­ImB2 simulations. ImB2 is a cytoplasmic protein and forms a stable structure in water. A 5-ns simulation with ImB2 immersed in water in a periodic box (simulation ImW) was conducted to observe the stability of the protein. The radius of gyration and secondary structure of ImB2 reveal that the protein was stable under these conditions. ImB2 was placed on the polar side of the CbnB2 amphipathic helix in four different orientations (simulations 1­4). Also in one of the simulations (simulation 5), ImB2 was placed on the hydrophobic side of the CbnB2 amphipathic helix. The two-peptide simulations were then run for 30 ns each. The initial distance between the centroids of the two peptides was maintained between 3.4 and 4.2 nm (Table 1). This distance was chosen to ensure that the box size does not become too large, and that the proteins are initially sufficiently apart such that they interact non-specifically. Different starting orientations (simulations 1­5) of ImB2 were used to ensure that all faces of the peptide were given an opportunity to interact with CbnB2 and the given simulation time allows random motion of the two peptides. Such a system was set up to allow change in orientation of the peptides such that any specific interaction between them could take place. 3.2. Peptide distribution and interaction Initial analysis of the trajectories of simulations 1­5 showed maximum penetration and interaction between ImB2 and the bilayer or CbnB2 in simulation 1, and to a lesser extent in simulations 2 and 5. There was not much movement of ImB2 observed in simulations 3 and 4. Fig. 2 depicts snapshots of the peptides at four instants (0, 10, 20, and 30 ns) during simulations 1 and 2. In these simulations, helix 5 at the Cterminal of ImB2 is oriented toward the CbnB2 or the DPPC­ water interface. At the end of simulations 1, 2, and 5, ImB2 has penetrated into the lipid head group region, but to different extents. Fig. 3 shows the density distribution of the two peptides and the phosphorus from the lipid head groups during the early (averaged over the first 2 ns) and late (averaged over the last 5 ns) stages of simulations 1­5. CbnB2 remains immersed in the bilayer core at all stages in all the simulations, whereas ImB2 resides mostly in the water phase during the early part of the simulations, and penetrates into the phosphate and glycerol ester regions during the later stages. However, the extent of penetration seems to be dependent on the orientation of ImB2 with respect to the lipid bilayer. When C-terminal helix 5 of ImB2 is facing the bilayer (simulations 1, 2, and 5), the penetration, as well as interaction between ImB2 and polar head groups of bilayer is enhanced. The primary goal of CbnB2­ImB2 simulations was to identify possible interaction between cytoplasmic ImB2 and CbnB2 in a membrane environment. The interaction between the two peptides was estimated by measuring the distance between them during simulations 1­5. Since ImB2 was oriented

Fig. 2. Interaction between ImB2 and CbnB2 in DPPC lipid bilayer system. Snapshots from simulations 1 (top row) and 2 (bottom row) at 0 ns, 10 ns, 20 ns, and 30 ns are shown. In the starting orientation (0 ns) of simulations 1 and 2, the helix 5 of ImB2 is facing the bilayer­water interface and CbnB2. The lipid is shown in bond format with the hydrophobic tails in green and the polar head group in multi-colors and water is shown in blue. ImB2 in water and CbnB2 in bilayer are shown in ribbon diagram.

Fig. 3. Density profile of ImB2, CbnB2, and the phosphorous in the DPPC bilayer for simulations 1­5 (a­e). Lines correspond to the peptides (grey) and the PC phosphorus (black). For the two peptides, grey solid lines correspond to the first 2 ns of the simulations and grey dashed lines are for the last 5 ns (25­ 30 ns) of the simulations. Similarly for the lipids, black solid lines correspond to the first 2 ns of the simulations and the black dashed lines are for the last 5 ns of the simulations.

differently in all the simulations, small regions (up to 10­15 residues) of ImB2 facing CbnB2 were chosen to measure the distance between them. For instance, the distance was measured between the centre of mass of CbnB2 and helix 5 of ImB2 (for simulations 1, 2, and 5), helix 1 of ImB2 (for simulation 3), or loop region between helices 3 and 4 of ImB2 (for simulation 4). Fig. 4a shows the evolution of the distance between the two peptides and suggests closest approach between them during simulation 1. On the average, during all the simulations, the peptides approach each other as shown by the decrease in the distance between them (by ca. 0.5 nm) since the beginning of the simulations. However, in simulation 1 there is maximum drop in the distance between the two peptides (0.9 nm). After about 15 ns in the simulation, there is a sudden decrease in the distance between the peptides suggesting short range interactions. Simulation 2 also shows the two peptides approaching each other by 0.83 nm, however, it is only in simulation 1 where the two peptides are at the closest separation (1.3 nm as opposed to 1.7 nm in simulation 2). Fig. 4b shows the distance between the centre of mass of ImB2 and the lipid bilayer as a function of time. Simulation 1 is compared to simulation ImPC where only ImB2 is present in the system and CbnB2 has been removed. This was done to illustrate that the penetration of ImB2 into the bilayer is due to the attraction between the two peptides. As shown in Fig. 4b, ImB2 remains essentially in the water layer throughout the ImPC simulation. Furthermore, simulation 1 was performed by replacing the zwitterionic DPPC bilayer molecules with nega-

CbnB2 in membrane environment. The small variation observed is perhaps due to the flexible loop regions on the Cand N-terminal regions of the peptide. The radius of gyration for ImB2 was ca. 1.35 nm and remained unchanged during all the simulations. The secondary structure of the peptides was monitored by the change in number of helical residues during the simulations. The three dimensional structure of CbnB2 determined by NMR technique shows that it has only one conserved secondary structural element, namely, -helix from residues 19 to 39 [5]. As shown in Fig. 6, CbnB2 maintained the C-terminal helix between residues 19 and 38 during most of the simulations 1 and 2. Similar results were observed during other simulations (not shown here). The structure of ImB2 is more complex compared to CbnB2. NMR solution structure of ImB2 [17] in water depicts (Fig. 1) five conserved -helices that extend from residues 3­16 (H1), 25­38 (H2), 44­60 (H3), 75­86 (H4), and 91­100 (H5). All five helices were found to be intact throughout the simulation as shown in Fig. 6. Secondary structure along with the radius of gyration values suggest that there were no structural changes in the two peptides during the simulations described here. 3.4. Peptide­lipid and peptide­peptide interaction We now turn our attention to the specific interaction at the surface of bilayer between ImB2 and the bilayer and between the two peptides. As shown above in Figs. 3 and 4, the penetration of the bilayer by ImB2 and short range attraction between the two peptides seems to occur mainly during simulations 1 and 2, so in this section the results of these two simulations will be discussed in detail. It was found that Arg95 from the helix 5 of ImB2 always points toward the polar head groups of the bilayer. To determine the potential interaction of Arg95 with the lipid head groups, we analyzed the RDF for the lipid head group phosphorous with respect to the guanidinium group of Arg95 (of ImB2) during simulations 1 and 2. The RDFs were compared between the first 5 ns (averaged over 0­5 ns) of the simulation with the later half

The distance is calculated between the centre of mass of CbnB2 and helix 5 of ImB2 (simulations 1, 2, and 5), helix 1 of ImB2 (simulation 3), or loop between helices 3 and 4 of ImB2 (simulation 4). (b) The distance between the centre of mass of ImB2 and lipid (DPPC or POPG) bilayer. Solid lines represent simulations with both ImB2 and CbnB2 in the lipid bilayer system. The dashed lines represent simulations with only ImB2 in the lipid bilayer system.

tively charged POPG bilayer. Interaction between ImB2 and the bilayer was monitored in the presence (simulation 1PG) and absence of CbnB2 (simulation ImPG) in the system. During both these simulations, ImB2 comes closer to the surface of bilayer but does not penetrate the bilayer as observed in simulation 1. The strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged ImB2 and the negatively charged polar head groups perhaps do not allow ImB2 to penetrate into the bilayer during 1PG simulation. These results support the interaction observed during simulation 1 between ImB2 and CbnB2 in DPPC bilayer system. 3.3. Secondary structure of peptides A local measure of the conformational stability of the secondary structure of the peptides is provided through the examination of the radius of gyration. Fig. 5 shows the variation in the radius of gyration of the two peptides with time for the five CbnB2­ImB2 simulations (1­5). The radius of gyration for the CbnB2 was ca. 1.95 nm and did not vary perceptibly during these simulations suggesting the conformational stability of

For these simulations, the starting structures for CbnB2 and ImB2 were the 5 ns snapshots from the simulations CbnPC and ImW, respectively. The vertical bars represent the helices in CbnB2 and ImB2.

of the simulation averaged from 15 to 30 ns. As shown in Fig. 7, at the beginning of the simulations 1 and 2, the first peak appeared at about 1.0 nm, but toward the end of the simulations, the peak shifted to a shorter distance of about 0.41 nm and 0.42 nm, respectively. This small distance indicates the probable

formation of salt-bridge interactions between the peptide and the lipid head group. However, as the peptide penetrates into the bilayer, this interaction is partly replaced by the salt-bridge interaction between the Arg95 of ImB2 and Glu24 of CbnB2 (in simulation 1) as discussed below. The side chains of two charged residues (from helix 5) of ImB2 were found in close proximity to another pair of charged residues from CbnB2 suggesting short range interactions between them. These residues are Arg95 and Glu92 (Glu98 for simulation 2) of ImB2 and Glu24 and Arg25 of CbnB2. The side chains of these residues are depicted in a snapshot from simulations 1 and 2 in Fig. 8. To identify possible salt­bridge interaction between the oppositely charged residues from ImB2 and CbnB2, the distance between positively charged guanidine group of arginine (Arg95N1 of ImB2) and the negative -carboxylate group of glutamate (Glu24-O1 of CbnB2) was measured as a function of time during simulations 1 and 2 (Fig. 9). In simulation 1, these residues maintain a distance of ca. 1.5 nm in the beginning (0­15 ns), but come much closer after 15 ns to about 0.5 nm apart. At this point (after 15 ns), the two peptides seem to interact by salt­bridge interaction at several intervals. A distance of 4 Å or less between the guanidine nitrogen and carboxyl carbon was considered as salt bridge interaction [37]. A larger separation is observed between these two residues during simulation 2, with 1.5 nm separation in the first 5 ns of the simulation and an average separation of ca. 1.2 nm after that suggesting that a salt­bridge interaction is unlikely. The distance between Glu92 (Glu98 for simulation 2) of ImB2 and Arg25 of CbnB2, another pair of oppositely charged residues from the two peptides, was found to be N 1.0 nm throughout simulations 1 and 2, again suggesting no potential salt­bridge between them.

R95 and E92 from helix 5 of ImB2 interact with E24 and R25 of CbnB2, respectively. Some hydrophobic residues from the amphipathic helix of CbnB2 are also shown. (b) Snapshot at 17 ns from simulation 2 highlighting the side chains of oppositely charged residues at the interface as well as all the polar and hydrophobic residues from the amphipathic helix of CbnB2. In this snapshot, R95 and E98 from helix 5 of ImB2 are pointing towards the oppositely charged E24 and R25 of CbnB2, respectively.

The two peptides come sufficiently close to each other in simulation 1 to interact by short range interactions. Fig. 10 shows the distance of closest approach (minimum distance between any two atoms) between ImB2 and CbnB2 during simulation 1. The peptides approach each other slowly, with the distance between them decreasing progressively during the simulation. At the beginning of the simulation, the minimum distance between the peptides is ca. 1.5 nm, at 10­15 ns the minimum distance is 0.8 nm and at 15­30 ns it varies between 0.3 and 0.5 nm. Even though the peptides come fairly close to each other, no hydrogen bonds were detected between them.

The main interaction found was the electrostatic interaction between the Arg95 of ImB2 and Glu24 of CbnB2. 4. Discussion In this study, we report MD simulations of a class IIa bacteriocin and its immunity protein in a lipid bilayer system. Class IIa bacteriocin, CbnB2 was embedded in lipid bilayer and ImB2 was immersed in aqueous layer to match the environment of these proteins used in NMR studies. The results of these simulations suggest that the two peptides form stable structures in their respective environments and interact with each other via salt­bridge formation near the lipid­water interface for certain initial configurations of the peptides. 4.1. Significance of initial orientation of ImB2 ImB2 was positioned in five different orientations in the aqueous layer with respect to CbnB2 in the periodic box. Some

of the orientations were chosen based on earlier studies. For example, simulations 1, 2, and 5 allow positioning of the Cterminal of ImB2 facing the bilayer and CbnB2. Johnsen et al. have shown that the C-terminal half of the immunity proteins contain a region that is specifically involved in gaining immunity against the cognate bacteriocin [10]. Furthermore, their findings show that C-terminal portion of the immunity protein recognizes, directly or indirectly, the C-terminal domain of the class IIa bacteriocins. Simulations 1 and 2 place helix 5 at the C-terminal of ImB2 in perpendicular and parallel orientations, respectively, facing the polar side of amphipathic helix of CbnB2. In simulation 5, helix 5 of ImB2 was again placed parallel to CbnB2 helix but on the other side of CbnB2 (below the bilayer). Sprules et al. suggest that a stretch of basic residues (His65, Lys66, and Arg67) at the end of helix 3 might be involved in interaction with the cell membrane and a receptor protein [17]. Since this loop is also on the same face as the Cterminal end of ImB2 (Fig. 1), this orientation with loop between helix 3 and 4 facing CbnB2 was chosen as the initial structure for MD in simulation 4. Finally in simulation 3, Nterminal region of ImB2 was placed in front of CbnB2 essentially to cover all of the main faces of ImB2 for any possible interaction with CbnB2. The MD results suggest that simulations (1, 2, and 5) with the helix 5 from the C-terminal region of ImB2 facing CbnB2 show enhanced movement of ImB2 towards CbnB2 as compared to other orientations (simulations 3 and 4, Fig. 3). Further, this movement of ImB2 is not due to the attraction between ImB2 and bilayer. As shown in Fig. 4b, ImB2 in hydrated DPPC bilayer system in the absence of CbnB2 (simulation ImPC) does not show any movement/attraction toward the bilayer. The distance between the peptide and the DPPC bilayer does not change throughout the simulation and is maintained between 4.5 and 4.9 nm. In simulation 5, helix 5 of ImB2 is placed facing the bilayer and CbnB2 as in simulations 1 and 2. However, here ImB2 is facing the hydrophobic side of the amphipathic helix of CbnB2. The highly charged helix 5 (six out of 10 residues are charged) is not attracted toward the helix of CbnB2 but instead displays interaction with the C-terminal charged residues (Arg46 and Arg47) of CbnB2. Thus, the distance between the centroid of helix 5 of ImB2 and CbnB2 decreases by only 0.49 nm during simulation 5. In simulations 1 and 2, this distance decreases by 0.91 and 0.83 nm, respectively. Further at the end of all the simulations, helix 5 of ImB2 and CbnB2 are closest to each other (1.3 nm apart) in simulation 1 as shown in Fig. 4a. 4.2. Critical hinge residue of class IIa bacteriocins NMR structural studies of class IIa bacteriocins such as Leucocin A, CbnB2, and Sakacin P show that the C-terminal region forms an amphipathic -helix and N-terminal region is either a coil or -sheet and these two domains are joined by a hinge region [4­6]. In a recent study, several hybrids of class IIa bacteriocins and their immunity proteins were constructed and it was found that the C-terminal domains from both the bacteriocin and immunity protein were important for recognition and activity [10]. These authors found that the residue

present at the hinge region of the bacteriocin was critical for activity. In particular, among the two hybrids from leucocin A and sakacin P, namely, Leu/Sak-16/17 and Leu/Sak-17/18, the former was found to have identical activity as sakacin P. The latter hybrid, which did not contain the hinge region Asp17 from sakacin P, was 5­20 times less potent than sakacin P against two most sakacin P­sensitive strains. Thus the negative charge of the aspartate residue was deemed crucial for the proper functioning of the hybrid. Furthermore, these authors previously showed that both the negative charge and its spatial orientation were important for activity [38]. They found that in Sakacin P mutation of Asp17 to Asn and a more conservative mutation to Glu were deleterious to the activity. In the simulations described here we observe that a glutamate (Glu24), close to the hinge region of CbnB2, interacts with a basic residue from the C-terminal region (Arg95) of ImB2 (Fig. 7). This specific ion-pair interaction between CbnB2 and ImB2 is observed mainly in simulations 1 and 2 suggesting that electrostatic interactions might play a crucial role in the recognition of the bacteriocin by its cognate immunity protein. Interestingly, a negatively charged residue, an aspartate or a glutamate, can be found at the hinge region or at the beginning of the C-terminal helix in most of the class IIa bacteriocins [3]. These results suggest that the negatively charged residue in class IIa bacteriocins may not only be important for activity [10,38] but might also be involved in providing protection specificity to the producer strain by interaction with the immunity protein. 4.3. Zwitterionic versus anionic bilayer Neutral, negatively charged, or mixed lipid bilayers have been used frequently as models for mimicking biological membranes [26,39,40]. In general, cell membranes of Grampositive bacteria have a higher percentage of negatively charged phospholipids as compared to the inner membrane of Gramnegative bacteria [41]. Here we have used saturated zwitterionic (DPPC) as well as unsaturated negatively charged (POPG) bilayers as mimics of membrane of Gram-positive bacteria and have attempted to study interactions between two peptides produced by them. Class IIa bacteriocins such as CbnB2 are antimicrobial peptides that are secreted via a dedicated ABC transporter [12]. Although these peptides are secreted, structural studies have shown that they adopt secondary structure only in membrane environment. The secondary structure may be essential for their activity as these peptides lose some activity [42] and secondary structure [8] at higher temperatures. Previously, we have studied the structure of several class IIa bacteriocins using MD simulations in TFE [8]. Here we have used DPPC or POPG bilayer systems to mimic the membrane environment for these peptides. Among all the simulations conducted (Table 1), a readily identifiable interaction between CbnB2 and its immunity protein was observed only during simulation 1. Although the movement of CbnB2 seemed restricted in both the bilayers, namely DPPC and POPG, ImB2 was able to penetrate the bilayer in the former system and make short range contacts with CbnB2. This seems reasonable

because zwitterionic membranes have been shown to posses a looser interface than the negatively charged membranes [43]. Further, we observed that water density in the bilayer near the head groups was higher in the DPPC bilayer compared to the POPG bilayer (not shown here). In negatively charged POPG bilayer system, ImB2 reached the surface of the bilayer in the first 5 ns and then remained there for the rest of the simulation (Fig. 4b). The presence or absence of CbnB2 (simulations 1PG and ImPG, respectively) did not have any effect on ImB2 movement. ImB2 was not able to penetrate the membrane in both the cases. Such electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged ImB2 and the POPG bilayer was observed in other simulations as well, where DPPC was replaced with POPG in simulations 2­5. In these simulations, the negatively charged polar head groups of the POPG bilayer most likely screened any possible interaction between the two peptides as observed in the representative simulation 1PG. 4.4. Recognition of a bacteriocin by its immunity protein Recent studies support that the C-terminal domains of class IIa bacteriocins and their immunity proteins determine the protection specificity of this class of bacteriocins. Further, the C-terminal domain, containing the amphipathic helix of class IIa bacteriocins has been proposed to be involved in direct or indirect (via a membrane receptor protein) interaction with the immunity protein. The results presented here suggest that the cytoplasmic ImB2 may recognize specific bacteriocin sequences once the bacteriocin becomes membrane associated. The non-specific interaction between the two peptides tend to bring ImB2 close to the bilayer. However, specific interaction between the two peptides seemed subdued when CbnB2 is immersed in the bilayer. It is likely that a more specific interaction could be observed when CbnB2 is bound to the surface of the bilayer and such simulations are currently in progress. The secreted bacteriocin are quite hydrophobic (elute at ca. 30­40% acetonitrile/water in reverse phase HPLC) and may associate with the host cell membrane and eventually become embedded in the membrane with the N-terminal facing the inner side of the host cell membrane (as shown in Fig. 2). This process of crossing the membrane is often observed in cellpenetrating peptides (CPP) [44]. CPP, like bacteriocins are positively charged peptides at physiological pH, have one negative charge at the C-terminus, and adopt amphipathic character when in an -helical structure. Thus bacteriocins may behave similarly with the membrane which will allow them to adopt an orientation as observed in Fig. 2 and interact directly with cytoplasmic immunity protein. The close approach of the two peptides displays direct interaction between mainly two residues (Arg95 and Glu92 of ImB2, Fig. 8). This interaction might be sufficient to trigger the initial steps in the recognition of the bacteriocin by the host cell. A somewhat similar mechanism (initial steps) has been proposed for the toxic activity of bacteriocins toward the target cells. Bacteriocins become associated with the target cell membrane and interact with IIC or/and IID subunit of mannose PTS permease receptor protein [11­13,45]. This association initiates pore formation in

the membrane and leakage of cellular contents. The molecular determinants of this specific interaction are not known yet. While our results suggest recognition of the bacteriocin by the immunity protein even when the former is completely embedded in the bilayer, an indirect recognition via a receptor protein cannot be excluded. For an indirect interaction, bacteriocins may not become completely embedded in the membrane but will need to come sufficiently close to the membrane or become membrane-associated so they can interact with the membrane-bound receptor. Finally, the present study gives insight into the mechanism by which class IIa bacteriocin immunity proteins might recognize their innate bacteriocins. It is clear that the mode of action by which immunity proteins provide protection against the bacteriocin produced by the host cell merits further examination from both experimental and computational perspectives. 5. Concluding remarks We have studied the interaction between a bacteriocin, CbnB2, and its immunity protein, ImB2, in a lipid bilayer system using MD simulations. In the starting configurations, ImB2 was placed in five different orientations in the aqueous layer with respect to a fixed CbnB2 orientation in the lipid bilayer. Lipid bilayers made of zwitterionic DPPC or negatively charged POPG molecules were used. The present study discusses six independent 30 ns simulations conducted in zwitterionic and negatively charged bilayers, accounting for the possibility of any direct interaction between the two peptides. In all these simulations, CbnB2 remained embedded in the bilayer over the entire time. However, movement of the polar Nterminal residues and the polar face of the amphipathic helix toward the head groups of the bilayer (inner leaflet facing ImB2) was observed. ImB2 was found to interact with the surface polar head groups of the bilayer in all the two-peptide simulations. In simulations 1 and 2, ImB2 further penetrates the bilayer to interact with CbnB2. In simulation 1, an ion-pair interaction between Arg95 and Glu92 of ImB2 and Glu24 and Arg25 of CbnB2, respectively, was observed. Arg95 of ImB2 was found to engage in salt­bridge interaction with Glu24 of CbnB2 at several intervals during the last 15 ns of simulation 1. At other times, the Arg95 was found to interact with the phosphate group of the DPPC molecules at the lipid­water interface. In POPG simulations, positively charged ImB2 interacts with the negative bilayer head groups. However, this interaction hinders its penetration inside the bilayer and prevents any further interaction with CbnB2. The six simulations discussed here do not display strong interaction between the two peptides, indicating that when CbnB2 is buried in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, its interaction with the cytoplasmic ImB2 is considerably muted. However, stronger specific interactions between the peptides cannot be entirely precluded. If the CbnB2 is surface bound or closer to the lipid head groups, there may be a greater possibility of observing more specific interactions between the peptides. Longer simulations might also reveal a greater, more specific interaction between the peptides.
