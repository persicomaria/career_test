Rubredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum. Structures of G10A, G43A and G10VG43A mutant proteins. Mutation of conserved glycine 10 to valine causes the 9±10 peptide link to invert
The four cysteine ligands which coordinate the Fe atom in the electron-transfer protein rubredoxin lie on loops of the polypeptide which form approximate local twofold symmetry. The cysteine ligands in the protein from Clostridium pasteurianum lie at positions 6, 9, 39 and 42. Two glycine residues adjacent to the cysteine ligands at positions 10 and 43 are conserved in all rubredoxins, consistent with the proposal that a -carbon substituent at these positions would eclipse adjacent peptide carbonyl groups [Adman et al. (1975). Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 72, 4854±4858]. X-ray crystal structures of the three mutant proteins G10A, G43A and G10VG43A are reported. The crystal structures of the single-site mutations are isomorphous with the native protein, space Ê group R3; unit-cell parameters are a = 64.3, c = 32.9 A for Ê G10A and a = 64.4, c = 32.8 A for G43A. The crystals of the double mutant, G10VG43A, were in space group P43212, unitÊ cell parameters a = 61.9, c = 80.5 A, with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The observed structural perturbations support the hypothesis that mutation of the conserved glycine residues would introduce strain into the polypeptide. In particular, in the G10VG43A protein substitution of valine at Gly10 causes the 9±10 peptide link to invert, relieving steric interaction between Cys9 O and Val10 C. This dramatic change in conformation is accompanied by the loss of the 10NÐHÁ Á ÁO6 hydrogen bond, part of the chelate loop Thr5± Tyr11. The new conformation allows retention of the 11NÐ HÁ Á ÁS9 hydrogen bond, but converts it from a type II to a type I hydrogen bond. This occurs at the cost of a less tightly packed structure. The structural insights allow rationalization of 1H NMR data reported previously for the 113CdII-substituted proteins and of the negative shifts observed in the FeIII/FeII mid-point potentials upon mutation.

1. Introduction
The rubredoxins (Rd) are the simplest of the iron±sulfur proteins, featuring a single Fe(S-Cys)4 site in a protein of molar mass of approximately 6 kDa (Eaton & Lovenberg, 1973; Holm et al., 1996; Day et al., 1992; Sieker et al., 1994). 14 examples from various anaerobic organisms have been sequenced and ®ve crystal structures have been reported (Day et al., 1992; Sieker et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1995; Mathieu et al., 1992; Dauter et al., 1996). A pseudo-twofold local symmetry is exhibited by the cysteine ligands and the two loops of the protein backbone which carry the cysteine ligands [residues 5± 11, 38±44 in the Clostridium pasteurianum (Cp) protein; Sieker et al., 1994]. Six NÐHÁ Á ÁS interactions are features of the site (Fig. 1) forming part of the second coordination sphere which tunes

the reduction potential (Adman et al., 1975; Carter et al., 1974; Stephens et al., 1996; Swartz et al., 1996; Okamura et al., 1998; Ê Denke et al., 1998). A range of 3.25±3.55 A for NÁ Á ÁS distances is consistent with the presence of hydrogen bonds. A number of these distances in the FeIII form of CpRd are outside this range, being termed `incipient' hydrogen bonds (Adman et al., 1975). These distances are expected to contract upon reduction to FeII to provide enhanced interactions which will stabilize the increased negative charge at the site (Day et al., 1992). The S atoms of the interior metal ligands Cys6 and Cys39 each form two hydrogen bonds of types I and III, as classi®ed by Adman et al. (1975) by analogy with the NÐHÁ Á ÁO hydrogen bonds formed in  turns (Adman et al., 1975). Surface metal ligands Cys9 and Cys42 form one hydrogen bond only, of type II. For the latter, it has been suggested that a  carbon on residue 10 or 43 would destabilize such an interaction by eclipsing the carbonyl O atoms of residues 9 or 42, respectively (Adman et al., 1975). Glycine residues are present in equivalent positions in all rubredoxins, consistent with this idea. Recently, we have probed the effect upon structure and reduction potential of systematic substitution of ligand S atoms for O atoms in the ®rst coordination sphere of CpRd (Xiao et al., 1998). In an attempt to systematically perturb the second coordination sphere, we have isolated mutant Rd proteins in which Gly10 and Gly43 are substituted by alanine and valine, i.e. the side-chain H is replaced by CH3 and

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization

The recombinant protein rRd and the mutant proteins were generated and puri®ed as detailed previously (Ayhan et al., 1996). Crystals of the proteins were grown under the conditions given in Table 1. Hanging drops containing protein (8 ml, 7±20 mg mlÀ1), ammonium sulfate (2±35%) and sodium acetate buffer (50 mM; pH 4.0±5.0) were equilibrated against a reservoir (700 ml) containing ammonium sulfate (50±70%) in the same buffer. The trays were stored at 277 K and small crystals could usually be observed within 4 d.
2.2. Data collection

Diffraction data were recorded at 293 K on a R-AXIS II imaging-plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator using a 0.2 Â 0.2 mm focus. The Ê X-rays (Cu K, ! = 1.5418 A) were collimated and focused with mirror optics (Molecular Structure Corp.). The data were integrated, scaled and merged using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1993). A summary of data collection, processing and re®nement is given in Table 2.

All calculations and manipulations were performed using Indigo XZ Silicon Graphics workstations. The common starting model for re®nement and molecular-replacement Ê calculations was the structure of CpRd re®ned at 1.2 A resolution (Watenpaugh et al., 1979). Structure calculations were carried out with programs from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) and È X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987). Initial re®nement was carried out with PROLSQ or X-PLOR (Konnert & Hendrickson, 1980). REFMAC was used for the ®nal re®nement of all structures (Murshudov et al., 1997). Rfree validation was based on a subset of 5% of re¯ections omitted during the entire re®nement procedure. Model building and visualization were carried out using O (Jones et al., 1991). For all structures, addition of water molecules followed examination of 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron-density maps and the satisfaction of

For both structures, re®nement was commenced with the 5rxn model from the Protein Data Bank, omitting water molecules. Five cycles of positional and thermal parameter re®nement was carried out using PROLSQ with data from 7 to Ê 2 A resolution. The R factors were 18.3 and 21.6% for the G10A and G43A structures, respectively. Following this initial re®nement, 8' peaks were observed in the electron-density difference maps within bonding distances of the C atoms of the mutated residues. The appropriate glycine residue in each case was mutated to alanine and re®nement was continued using REFMAC (Table 2).
2.5. The G10VG43A structure

Since the space group of the G10VG43A crystals differed from that of native CpRd (Table 2), the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the 5rxn structure (with water molecules omitted) as the search model. The solvent content of the crystals, as given by VM, the ratio of the volume of the unit cell to the molecular weight of protein in the cell, is 3.14 Ê or 2.10 A3 DaÀ1 for two or three molecules per asymmetric unit, respectively. Both these values are within the normally observed range (Matthews, 1977). The presence of two molecules per asymmetric unit was con®rmed by the structure solution. Rotation functions were calculated using all re¯ecÊ tions between 8 and 3 A, with integration radii between 12 and Ê , in 0.5 A steps. The best 40 solutions, using an integration Ê 20 A Ê radius of 12.5 A, were submitted to a translation-function search in each of the enantiomeric space groups, using Ê re¯ections between 6.5 and 3.5 A resolution.

with a correlation coef®cient of 0.295, was 46% higher than the next highest peak. The ®rst molecule was then ®xed in this position and the remaining rotation-function solutions were subjected to a further translation-function search in order to ®nd the second molecule. The correlation coef®cient for the second solution was 0.505, which was 70% higher than the next highest peak. Solutions in space group P43212 were clearly better than those in P41212 and the choice of the former was con®rmed. Electron-density difference maps failed to indicate the presence of a third molecule in the asymmetric unit. Initial re®nement of the model, parameterized as two rigid bodies, was carried out using X-PLOR with data in the resoÊ lution range 15±4 A resolution, with corrections for the bulksolvent contribution to the structure factors. The resulting R and Rfree were 39.5 and 41.5%, respectively. Following two complete cycles of positional and isotropic temperature-factor re®nement, the residuals for the model were R = 32.8% and Ê Rfree = 34.3% for data in the resolution range 50±1.9 A. The two mutations were evident as positive peaks in electrondensity difference maps adjacent to the C atoms of residues 10 and 43. These electron-density features were present for both molecules in the asymmetric unit. The peak associated with residue 10 was signi®cantly larger in volume than that associated with residue 43 (Fig. 3). Residue 10 was subsequently mutated to valine and residue 43 to alanine in both molecules. Re®nement proceded with the addition of solvent molecules using REFMAC (Table 2). Signi®cant features in an electron-density difference map (Fig. 4) near the peptide of residue 10 indicated that the amide group should be ¯ipped.

For the alanine mutants, the respective torsion angles move closer to the allowed values for a left-handed helix in the Ramachandran plot but remain in only the additionally allowed regions. However, the NÁ Á ÁS distances characteristic of the NÐHÁ Á ÁS hydrogen bonds are maintained (Table 3).

4. Discussion
Within the accuracy of the data (e.s.d's for bond lengths and Ê angles are 0.1 A and 3 , respectively), mutation of the conserved Gly10 and Gly43 residues of CprRd to alanine and valine does not alter the coordination geometry of the FeIII site (Table 3). It has been proposed that the presence of glycine residues at positions 10 and 43 is necessary for maintenance of the 11 NHÁ Á ÁS9 and 44 NHÁ Á ÁS42 hydrogen-bonding interactions (Adman et al., 1975). The stereochemistry necessary to allow the NH functions to achieve a favourable orientation with the ligand S atoms (type II) would lead to -carbon groups at positions 10 and 43 being eclipsed by Cys9 and Cys42 O groups, respectively. These mutations have not signi®cantly affected the NÐHÁ Á ÁS hydrogen bonds but have introduced strain into the polypeptide, resulting in the mutant proteins having reduced stability in solution, consistent with this proposal (Ayhan et al., 1996). For the alanine mutants, there are small changes in the relative orientation of the peptide amide groups around the mutation, leading to a shift of the protein backbone away from the Fe atom: the 10NH function in G10A and the 43NH Ê function of G43A both shift by 0.2 (1) A relative to their positions in rRd. Substitution of glycine by valine at Gly10 causes the 9±10 peptide link to invert in the G10VG43A protein, relieving

The geometry around the iron site in both molecules in the asymmetric unit is similar to that seen in the G10A and G43A proteins. In response to steric interaction between Cys9 O and the Val10 side chain, a major structural change is apparent around position 10 (Fig. 4). Relevant CÐN (9) and CÐC (2) torsion angles are listed in Table 4. The peptide bond linking residues 9 and 10 has inverted, as indicated by the changes of À162 (6) in 2 (Cys9) and À176 (6) in 9 (Gly/Val10). The result of the peptide ¯ip is that strain in the polypeptide is relieved and the associated torsion angles for Val10 now lie in a fully allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The C O bond of Cys9 now projects inwards towards residues 5±7 of the chelate loop rather than forming part of the molecular surface (Fig. 5). The 10NÐ HÁ Á ÁO6 hydrogen bond, part of the chelate loop Thr5±Tyr11, is lost and replaced by an unfavourable Cys9 OÁ Á ÁCys6 O Ê interaction (2.9 A) (Fig. 5). The type II 11NÐHÁ Á ÁS9 hydrogen bond (Fig. 1) appears to be maintained but has been converted into a type I interaction (Adman et al., 1975); the torsion angles at Cys9 change by À25 (6) and À162 (6) , respectively. These changes cause the

steric interaction between Cys9 O and Val10 C (Figs. 4 and 5). This dramatic change in conformation is accompanied by the loss of the 10NÐHÁ Á ÁO6 hydrogen bond, part of the structure of the chelate loop Thr5±Tyr11. However, the new conformation allows the 11NÐHÁ Á ÁS9 interaction to be maintained, although it is converted from a type II to a type I hydrogen bond (Adman et al., 1975). In the 1H NMR spectrum of the 113CdII-substituted G10V protein, large changes in chemical shift (À0.8 to +0.6 p.p.m.) are observed for the NH protons in the Cys6±Tyr11 chelate loop (Ayhan et al., 1996). These were attributed to the CH(CH3)2 side chain of Val10 occupying part of the surface pocket de®ned by the CO functions of the loop. It is now apparent that the changes are associated with the altered environments of the NH protons caused by the inversion of the 9±10 peptide bond. On the other hand, small changes (<0.06 p.p.m.) are seen for the NH protons of the Cys39±Val44 chelate loop in the G43V protein, with the single exception of

the Val44 NH proton (À0.36 p.p.m.). It is apparent that the 42± 43 peptide link has not changed orientation. The 44NÐ HÁ Á ÁS42 interaction involves the only NÁ Á ÁS distance sensitive to CdII substitution (Ayhan et al., 1996). The differential effects of substitution of valine at Gly10 and Gly43, related by the pseudo-twofold symmetry, is emphasized in the double mutant G10VG43V, where the observed chemical shifts correlate closely with those of the single mutants, and also indicate that the effects induced by mutation in one chelate loop are not transmitted to the other. Such localization is consistent with the weak hydrophobic contacts which exist between the chelate loops (Ayhan et al., 1996). The contrasting behaviour appears to be driven by differences in the molecular surface presented by the two chelate loops. The side chains of the residues Thr5 [CH(OH)CH3] and Val38 [CH(CH3)2] at the start of the Cys6± Tyr11 and Cys39±Val44 loops adopt different orientations (Ayhan et al., 1996). The proteins with mutations at Gly10 or Gly43 exhibit negative shifts of up to 50 mV in their FeIII/FeII midpoint potentials relative to that of rRd, implying increased stability of the oxidized [FeIII(S-Cys)4] centre relative to the reduced form (Ayhan et al., 1996). The effect of incorporation of Val is greater than that of Ala and, in addition, an additivity of the differential effects of the single mutants is seen in double mutants, apparently again owing to the weak interactions only between the chelate loops (cf 1H NMR above). The negative shifts can be rationalized by the following interrelated effects, which stabilize the oxidized centres by limiting delocalization of negative charge (Stephens et al., 1996). (i) Perturbations in the orientation of the peptide amide groups in the vicinity of the mutation are observed, which may correlate to a shift away from the Fe atom. In the case of the valine mutation at position 10, the amide group is inverted and orients its negative pole towards the Fe atom. (ii) Substitution of Gly by Ala or Val provides more bulky hydrophobic groups on the protein surface, restricting effective access of solvent water and decreasing the local dielectric constant.
