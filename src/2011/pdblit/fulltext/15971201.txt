Introduction. Itchy mice suffer immune and inflammatory defects and have a constant itching of the skin.1­3 The affected gene encodes a HECT (homologous to E6-AP COOH-terminus) type E3 ubiquitin ligase, Itch, which as well as the HECT catalytic domain, contains a C2, membrane localization domain and four WW domains.4 The WW domain is the smallest independent structural unit-- about 40 amino acids5--that takes its name from the two signature tryptophans found in most of the domains known to date. All WW domain structures solved by NMR and X-ray crystallography have been consistent in describing the fold as a twisted triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet structure (for review see, Macias et al.6). The WW domains of Itch, like other WW domains have been shown to interact with proteins that contain PPxY motifs (where "x" is any amino acid).6 ­10 Structural studies of several WW domains in complex with PPxY-containing ligands provide information about the nature of this interaction. However, what remains to be understood are the rules that regulate such an interaction. Itch has recently been shown to be phosphorylated in T cells.11 Furthermore, phosphorylation of the Pin1 (prolineisomerase 1) WW domain on a single serine is known to have an inhibitory effect on ligand binding.12 The equivalent position in a subset of WW domains, including the third WW domain of Itch (Itch-ww3) is predicted to provide a phosphorylation site for Casein kinase II (CK2) or Protein Kinase A (PKA) [Fig. 1(a)]. A second highly conserved Ser/Thr residue in the third strand is also a typical site for CK2 phosphorylation [Fig. 1(a)]. Given their position within the ligand binding site, we hypothesized that phosphorylation on either residue may provide regulation by means of steric hindrance. However, due to the fact that both residues are located in or adjacent to elements of secondary structure, the phosphate groups may induce a distortion in the protein three-dimensional structure and the inhibitory effect be the result of such structural changes. In order to understand the impact phosphorylation at either site would have on the fold of the domain, we have determined the solution structure of the Itch-ww3 domain

by heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and examined the fold of Ser16 and Thr30 phosphorylated Itch-ww3. Material and Methods. The gene fragment corresponding to Itch-ww3 domain was inserted into a modified pET24d vector enabling production of the respective Nterminal fusion protein containing a His-tag followed by GST and the TEV protease cleavage site. The protein was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified in three chromatographic steps involving affinity and size exclusion chromatography. To prepare 13C- and/or 15 N-labeled samples, E. coli cultures were grown in minimal medium (M9) with 13C-D-glucose and/or 15NH4Cl as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. The NMR samples had a protein concentration of 1.0 mM and were dissolved in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O (pH 6.0). Synthesis of the phosphorylated domains: The synthesis of both Itch-ww3 phosphorylated domains was performed automatically on an Applied Biosystems 433A Peptide synthesizer using the Fmoc/tBu strategy and 10 equivalents of TBTU/HOBt/DIEA as the coupling mixture. FmocSer(PO(OBzl)OH)OH and FmocThr(PO(OBzl)OH)OH amino acids were purchased at Novabiochem, Darmstadt. The final peptide was cleaved with 94%TFA/2.5% H2O/ 2.5%EDT/1%TIS and precipitated in cold ether.

Fig. 1. a: Itch-ww3 sequence. Two possible sites identified by NetPhos 2.0 phosphorylation prediction server are indicated in red. The immediate amino acid environment of Thr30 is typical of a phosphorylation site for Casein kinase II, CK2, whereas protein kinase A, PKA is predicted to phosphorylate both Thr30 and Ser16. b: A ribbon representation of Itch-ww3 domain showing the side chains of conserved aromatic residues in magenta. Ser16 and Thr30 are displayed in gold. The stereo-view of the best-fit backbone superposition of 10 NMR derived structures selected according to the lowest energy is shown in the Supplementary Material. The structures are displayed with MOLMOL.20 c: Selected region of 2D NOESY experiments carried out in D2O, showing a characteristic pattern of ­ NOEs found in the WW fold. 1 corresponds to T30-V23, 2 to K12-F22, 3 to N24-W10, and 4 T14-V20. A table containing the proton chemical shifts of the three domains is given as Supplementary Material.

material of each reaction was purified by preparative HPLC until a sample with a purity of 96% (characterized by HPLC-MS) was obtained. NMR spectroscopy and structure calculation: Itchy_ww3 domain: NMR experiments were carried out at 285K on Bruker DRX-600 and DRX-800 NMR spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance z-gradient probes. Standard triple resonance experiments were used to assign the backbone and aliphatic side-chain atoms, while aromatic proton-assignments were obtained from 2D homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY and 3D 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Inter-proton distance restraints were obtained from 3D 15 N- and 13C-edited NOE experiments using mixing times of 160 ms.13,14 Both NOESY spectra were integrated using the XEASY package.15 All data were processed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw16 and analyzed with XEASY. The structures were calculated using CNS17 and ARIA 2.018 programs (seven iterations of 30 structures each and a final iteration of 50, using 628 restraints). The 10 best structures of the last iteration were submitted to water refinement. The quality of the final structures was evaluated using the program PROCHECK-NMR.19 Itchy_ww3 phosphorylated domains: Since the samples were chemically synthesized, they were not enriched in 13 C and 15N isotopes, thus the assignments were exclusively obtained from 2D-homonuclear spectra at 285K. Description of the wild-type structure: Figure 1(b) illustrates the solution structure of the mouse Itch-ww3 domain in a ribbon representation displaying the secondary

structure elements and the aromatic amino acid sidechains. Ser16 and Thr30 residues are also highlighted. A superposition of the 10 lowest energy structures in shown in the Supplementary Material. Table I summarizes the structural statistics for these structures. The structure of Itch-ww3 consists of a twisted and slightly bent triplestranded anti-parallel beta-sheet, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the three strands, identified as residues 10 ­14, 20 ­24, and 29 ­31. A "hydrophobic buckle" formed by the proximity of Trp10, Phe22, and Pro35 further stabilizes the structure which is very similar to that of other WW domains determined so far. Another typical feature is the presence of an aromatic groove which provides part of the binding site for proline-rich ligands (Macias et al. 2000). In Itch-ww3 this is formed by Tyr21 and Trp32. Both the Ser16 and Thr30 side chains are close to this pocket with the hydroxyl groups exposed on the surface of the domain, making them accessible for phosphorylation by a relevant kinase. Phosphorylation at Ser16 and at Thr30 does not influence folding of Itch-ww3: 2D 1H-1H TOCSY and NOESY spectra demonstrate that both phosphorylated samples are folded, with no apparent disruption to the classical structure of the domain. As expected, chemical shift changes with respect to the wild-type values were detected for residues close to the phosphorylated amino acids but the pattern of NOEs is fully maintained in both of the phosphorylated Itch-ww3 domains, a proof of structure conservation. Figure 1(c) compares a representative area of the NOESY spectra for the wild-type Itch-ww3 and for the Ser16 and Thr30 phosphorylated domains. The chemical shifts of the mutants and wild type are given as Supplementary Material. Conclusion: These results provide a good basis for further investigation into the influence of phosphorylation on the function of the Itch-ww3 domain, such as the possible inhibitory role that phosphorylation of the domain may play in ligand binding. The structural data described here indicate that inhibition would be related to the steric hindrance that the phosphate group may cause in the binding site or to the fact that phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group would prevent hydrogen bond formation with the ligand backbone. The structure of Ser16 or Thr30 phosphorylated Itch-ww3 mutants appears to remain intact and identical to that of the wild type, so an inhibitory effect of such phosphorylation on ligand binding cannot be due to unfolding of the domain. Deposition of Assignments and Coordinates: The 1H, 15 N, and 13C chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank database (http://www.bmrb. wisc.edu) under the accession number 6459, and the protein coordinates in the protein data bank under accession number 1YIU.
