Abstract SH3 domains from the Src family of tyrosine kinases represent an interesting example of the delicate balance between promiscuity and specificity characteristic of proline-rich ligand recognition by SH3 domains.

Comparison with other SH3 domains from the Src family revealed significant deviations in the loop regions. In particular, the n-Src loop, highly flexible and partially disordered, is stabilized in an unusual conformation by the establishment of several intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

1. Introduction The Src homology 3 (SH3) domains from the Src family constitute a clear example of the complex balance between promiscuity and specificity characteristic of SH3 interactions. This family of kinases comprises a subclass of membrane-associated non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways that are frequently over-expressed and/or aberrantly activated in a variety of cancers. There are nine members of the family, c-Src, c-Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Blk, Fgr, and Yrk, which share a common domain architecture including one SH3 domain responsible for the regulation of the kinase activity and the recruitment of substrates. c-Src, c-Yes and Fyn are the three most homologous members of the family, with sequence identities close to 70% in their SH3 domains. Although these kinases have been postulated to perform redundant functions in the cell, their implication in tumour development is different

[1] and there is an increasing body of evidence for specificity in signalling, in some instances determined by interactions mediated by their SH3 domains [1≠3]. The elucidation of the molecular determinants of binding specificity between these domains would obviously benefit from the comparison of their structural features. However, although several structures of the SH3 domains from the Src family both unliganded and complexed with ligands are currently available [4≠11], no structural information has been reported for the SH3 domain of c-Yes. We present here the first high-resolution structure of the unliganded c-Yes SH3 domain obtained by X-ray crystallography. The structure shares the same overall fold with other SH3 domains and the geometry and orientation of conserved aromatic side-chains in the recognition site for the PxxP motif are very similar to those observed for the closely related c-Src and Fyn SH3 domains. However, significant differences are found in the loop regions. In particular, high flexibility is observed for the n-Src loop. In spite of the high resolution of the crystals, the beginning of the n-Src loop is partially disordered, with residue Asn123 lacking enough electronic density to be properly modelled. Moreover, in comparison with other SH3 domains, the n-Src loop is found in an unusual conformation that is stabilized by the establishment of several intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. Additionally, the SH3 domain of c-Yes is found to aggregate into amyloid fibrils at acidic pH and relatively low concentrations. The importance of RT loop flexibility as well as the ionization state of some acidic residues in the region in the mechanism of amyloid aggregation is discussed.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cloning, expression and purification of Human c-Yes SH3 domain The gene coding for the SH3 domain of the c-Yes tyrosine kinase was engineered using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method [12] from four overlapping oligonucleotides. The resulting PCR product was digested with the NcoI and HindIII restriction enzymes and cloned into the pBAT4 plasmid [13]. The identity and integrity of the SH3 domain of the c-Yes tyrosine kinase (c-Yes-SH3) gene was checked by DNA sequencing. The c-Yes SH3 domain was expressed and purified as described elsewhere [14,15]. Briefly, plasmid-encoded SH3 domain was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Novagen) using 1 mM isopropyl-b-D -thiogalactopyranoside as inducing agent. Harvested cells were resuspended in 100 mM Tris, pH 9.0 buffer and broken with two passes through a French pressure cell. The SH3 domain was precipitated from the supernatant with ammonium sulphate at 75% saturation and resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride buffer at pH 6.5. The protein was further

1702 purified on a Superdex-75 column equilibrated and eluted with the same buffer. SH3-bearing fractions were pooled, concentrated and stored at ¿20 ∞C at above 5 mg ml¿1 in the same buffer. Protein purity was checked by SDS≠PAGE and mass spectrometry and estimated to be higher than 99%. Under these conditions the c-Yes SH3 domain is stable for several months. SH3 domain concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 16 500 M¿1 cm¿1. Extinction coefficients were calculated using the Gill and von Hippel's method [16]. 2.2. Crystallization and data collection The purified c-Yes SH3 domain was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0 and concentrated to approximately 10 mg ml¿1 using a Microcon YM-3. Crystallization conditions were identified using Crystal Screen I and II reagent kits (Hampton Research). Crystallization was performed using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 15 ∞C temperature in 48-well plates, so that 2 ll of protein were mixed with 2 ll of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 200 ll of reservoir solution. Small crystals appear in few days in condition #4 from Crystal Screen I (2.0 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M Tris≠ HCl, pH 8.5). After optimization of the crystallization conditions, the best crystals were obtained in 1.6 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M bicine at pH 9.0. As a standard crystallization procedure, 10 ll droplets were prepared by mixing 5 ll of protein solution and 5 ll of reservoir solution. The mixture was vapour equilibrated against 500 ll of reservoir solution. Under these conditions, crystals typically appear within one or two weeks. For data collection crystals were transferred to a mother liquor solution containing a final concentration of 10% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. The looped crystals were then placed in a cold nitrogen stream (Kryoflex) maintained at 110 K. A total of 600 frames of 0.5∞ oscillation images were collected for each data set with a Bruker Microfocus (Montel Optics) Microstar rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 45 kV and 60 mA with kappa configuration and a Proteum X8 CCD detector. Integrated intensity information for each reflection was obtained with the program SAINT and scaled with the SADABS ∞ module of the PROTEUM suite. The best crystal diffracted to 1.8 A resolution and belonged to the P6322 space group, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 46.009, c = 90.431, a = b = 90.00 and c = 120.00. The Matthews coefficient [17] is 1.98 with a solvent content of 38% for one molecule at the asymmetric unit.

Structure resolution and refinement Initial phasing was obtained using Molrep [18] taking the coordinates for the Fyn-SH3 domain (Protein Data Bank code 1FYN) without ligand and water molecules as reference. Only one peak was obtained for the rotation function, and the translation function after rigid body refinement in REFMAC5 gives an initial R factor of 50%. After rigid body refinement, several cycles of restrained positional and temperature factor refinement using the resolution range 20≠ ∞ 1.9 A were alternated with manual building using the resulting rAweighted (2Fo ¿Fc) and (Fo ¿ Fc) electron density maps and the COOT program [19]. To avoid model bias an annealing omit map was used to build the loops. Once the model reached an R factor value below 30%, the final step of the refinement was carried out with REFMAC5 using the TLS parameters defined for each of the TLS domains with the server TLSMD [20]. Water molecules were placed in the electron density difference maps using the ARP/wARP v5.0 program from the CCP4 suite [21]. One sulphate ion, coming from the crystallization solution, was positioned in the residual electron density next to Arg105. 2.4. Amyloid aggregation Tests for amyloid formation including Congo red and Thioflavin T assays as well as far-UV circular dichroism and electron microscopy experiments were carried out as described in Morel et al. [22].

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Crystal structure of c-Yes SH3 domain The crystallographic structure of the SH3 domain of the hu∞ man c-Yes tyrosine kinase has been solved at 1.9 A resolution. The final model contains one chain with 57 amino acid residues and 38 solvent molecules with an R-factor of 20.7% (Rfree 27.1%). All the residues in the structure lie in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, as defined by PROCHECK [23]. As is the case for most SH3 domains, some highly disorder N- and C-terminal residues have not been modelled due to lack of electronic density.

The SH3 domain of c-Yes shares the b-barrel fold described for other SH3 domains consisting of two orthogonal b-sheets containing five anti-parallel strands connected by a turn of 310-helix and three loops: the RT loop that connects strands b1 and b2, the n-Src loop that connects strands b2 and b3 and the distal loop, which connects strands b3 and b4. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, where the backbone superposition of the c-Yes SH3 structure with other SH3 domains from the Src family is shown, the overall structure is maintained between the different domains, with low RMSD values ranging from 0.74 to 1.28 (Table 2). The hydrophobic binding site that recognizes the PxxP consensus motif in the ligands is a shallow hydrophobic groove lined with highly conserved aromatic residues with geometries and orientations very similar to those found for the closely related c-Src and Fyn SH3 domains. Only Trp128 adopts a different conformation to establish a hydrogen bond between the pyrrolic nitrogen of the side chain and a water molecule bound to Tyr102 and the sulphate ion placed in the threefold axis, which neutralizes the charge of Arg105. An additional twofold axis perpendicular to the threefold axis generates a hexamer. Analysis of the structure using the PISA protein interface server [24] shows a very tight packing and several interfaces of different nature. The crystal contact generated by the threefold axis is mostly polar with a salt bridge interaction between Arg105, Asp109, and the sulphate ion playing a central role. Conversely, the bigger interface generated by the two-fold axis implicates up to 19 residues and a ∞ buried surface area of 452.8 A2 (73% non-polar) with no hydrogen bond or salt-bridge interactions involved. 3.2. High flexibility and anomalous conformation for the n-Src loop of c-Yes-SH3 In spite of the common overall folding, significant deviations are observed in the loop conformations, particularly in the nSrc region. The RT and n-Src loops are highly variable in sequence between the different SH3 domains (see Fig. 1) and constitute the so-called specificity pocket adjacent to the highly conserved PxxP motif recognition site [25,26]. High flexibility as well as conformational rearrangement of these loops upon ligand binding has been previously reported for other SH3 domains and their dynamic properties have been described to be important for the determination of binding specificity [27≠30]. This flexibility is reflected in the large rmsd values commonly

observed between models in the NMR structures [31] and results frequently in poor electronic density that challenges the modelling in X-ray experiments. This is indeed the case for the c-Yes SH3 domain that, in spite of the high resolution of the crystals, shows considerable disorder in the beginning of the n-Src region. As a consequence, Asn123 lacks enough electronic density to be properly modelled so its side chain has been placed in a minimum energy conformation, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Significant dispersion in the conformation of the n-Src loop is observed for the different structures of the SH3 domains from the Src tyrosine kinases. The conformational diversity found in this region for the different structures of the free Fyn-SH3 domain obtained by X-ray (1SHF) or NMR (1NYF) and the Fyn-SH3 domain complexed with the 3BP-2 decapeptide (1FYN) clearly illustrates the plasticity of this loop (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the X-ray structures of the FynSH3 domain obtained in our laboratory (unpublished results) reveal significant differences in this region between the two chains present in the asymmetric unit, so that one of the chains adopts a conformation, stabilized by protein-protein contacts, closer to that found in the complex with a proline-rich peptide (1FYN). In the c-Yes-SH3 structure several hydrogen bonds are established between some side chains in strand b-2 and the N-terminal residues of strand b-1 [Asn122-Gly92 (N≠O ∞ ∞ 2.83 A and ND2≠O 3.45 A), Asn122-Thr94 (OD1≠OG1 ∞ ), Ile 120- Thr94 (O≠N 2.94 A, N≠O 2.85 A), Phe118∞ ∞ 2.83 A ∞ ∞ ∞ Phe96 (O≠N 2.87 A, O≠O 3.54 A and N≠O 2.93 A), Glu116∞ ∞ Ala98 (O≠N 2.93 A) and Gly115-Ala98 (N≠O 2.99 A)] that induce a displacement of the backbone in this region and stabilize the n-Src loop in a conformation markedly different from that observed for other SH3 domains, including the highly homologous c-Src and Fyn tyrosine kinases (Fig. 2A). This region in the protein is not implicated in any crystal contacts so it is reasonable to assume that this conformation probably corresponds to the lowest energy conformation in solution for the free SH3 domain. This conformation is also significantly different from that found in most SH3 complexes, so that binding of the proline-rich ligand would take place via an ``induced-fit'' mechanism that would require the disruption of some of the above mentioned intra-molecular hydrogen bonds.

The n-Src loop conformation in the c-Yes-SH3 structure is restricted by the preceding residue that is forming several hydrogen bonds with N-terminal ∞ residues (Asn122 N-Gly92 O 2.83 A; Asn122 OD1-Thr94 OG1 ∞ 2.83 A).

3.3. RT loop and amyloid formation During the screening for crystallization, it was found that at low pH the c-Yes-SH3 solutions quickly turn into gels at relatively low concentrations and at room temperature. Electron microscopy analysis of the gels reveals that at protein concentrations of $1 mg ml¿1 at pH 3.0 long fibrils of about 8 nm width are formed in the absence of salt in few days at room temperature (Fig. 4). Moreover the c-Yes fibrils show a redshift in the Congo-red solution assay, which is characteristic of amyloid aggregates [22]. Further Thioflavin binding assays and far-UV CD experiments are also indicative of amyloid formation (data not shown). Amyloid aggregation has been previously reported for some SH3 domains, such as PI3 SH3 domains [32≠35] and some mutants of alpha-spectrin [22], although this is the first experimental report of amyloid formation by an SH3 domain from

the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Amyloid aggregation had been predicted for the SH3 domain of c-Src based on molecular dynamic simulation studies, according to which, in addition to the functional implications in binding specificity [27≠30], the high flexibility of the RT loop is central to fibril formation [36]. These simulations reveal a ``generic mechanism'' for amyloid aggregation that implies swapping of the RT loops from different SH3 domains. The RT loops pack closely against each other, adopting b-sheet conformations that are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and originate the core structure for the formation of amyloid fibrils [36]. Given that the RT loops of c-Src and c-Yes SH3 domains are identical in sequence (Fig. 1) it seems reasonable to consider such mechanism as a plausible description of the c-Yes-SH3 amyloid aggregation process. Interestingly, the RT loop conformation found for the c-YesSH3 crystal structure is very similar to that observed for cSrc, in spite of the dispersion in the conformations adopted by the RT loops in different SH3 domains. The formation of amyloid fibrils by c-Yes-SH3 is pH dependent, with no aggregation being observed above pH 3.0. At

this pH the protein bears positive net charge from the lysine and arginine residues. Interestingly, the c-Src and c-Yes RT loops contain a cluster of three acidic residues (Asp101, Asp109 and Glu116) located closely to some positively charged amino acids (Arg105, Lys113 and Lys114), which indicates that the observed pH dependency of fibril formation is likely to be related to the protonation state of these residues.
