Abstract Perchloroethene (Per) is a widely used industrial solvent and common environmental contaminant. In rats, long-term inhalation of Per is known to cause a small increase in the incidence of renal tubule cell tumors in males only; renal toxicity is seen in female rats and in both sexes of mice after prolonged Per exposure. The renal toxicity of Per is likely mediated by a glutathione-dependent bioactivation reaction. Glutathione S-transferase mediated formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione is the first step in a sequence of reactions finally resulting in the formation of reactive intermediates in the kidney. In this study, we compared the enzymatic rates of formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione in liver and kidney subcellular fractions from rats, mice, and from both sexes of humans (n= 11). In microsomal fractions from the liver and kidney of all three species, enzymatic formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione from Per could not be observed. S-(1,2,2Trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation (the structure was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry) was observed in liver cytosol from both male and female rats and mice. However, the rates of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation in liver cytosol from male rats (84.5 912 pmol/mg per min) were approximately four times higher than from

female rats (19.5 98 pmol/mg per min) and from both sexes of mice (27.9 96 and 26.0 9 4 pmol/mg per min). Low rates of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation were also seen in kidney cytosol from mice (12 96 pmol/mg per min), but not from rats. In human liver subcellular fractions, enzymatic formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione could not be detected. The human liver cytosolic fractions, however, exhibited glutathione S-transferase activity (as determined using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene as marker substrates) in the same order of magnitude as rat and mouse liver cytosol. In contrast to other marker activities for glutathione S-transferases, the ability of all human liver cytosol samples to catalyze the glutathione conjugation of 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene was three orders of magnitude lower compared to rat and mouse liver cytosol. 1,2-Dichloro-4-nitrobenzene conjugation was also four times higher in liver cytosol from male rats compared to female rats. The results suggest that the ability of the human liver to catalyze the formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione from Per is at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of rat liver, and that sex-specific differences in the extent of hepatic conjugation of Per with glutathione, which may be relevant for nephrotoxicity, occur in rats. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction Perchloroethene (Per) is widely used as an industrial solvent in degreasing. Because of its low toxicity and low irritating potential, exposure has been frequent. Moreover, due to the chemical stability of Per, this compound is only slowly degraded in the environment and remains a contaminant [1]. After repeated administration of Per the liver and the kidney are the major target organs of toxicity [1]. In mice, repeated administration of Per causes liver damage and liver tumors. Peroxisome proliferation has been implicated as a mechanism of the hepatic toxicity of Per in mice [2]. In male rats, long-term inhalation of Per (400 ppm for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 103 weeks) caused a small increase in the incidence of uncommon renal tumors (tubule cell adenoma and adenocarcinoma). Renal tumors were not seen in female rats exposed under the same conditions; however, both sexes of rats showed evidence of chronic renal toxicity due to Per administration [3,4]. The toxicity of Per to liver and kidney is caused by bioactivation to toxic metabolites [5 ­ 9]. Per is metabolized in rodents and humans by two pathways, P450-mediated oxidation and glutathione conjugation (Fig. 1). Oxidation of Per (1, Fig. 1) by cytochrome P450 results in trichloroacetic acid (4, Fig. 1) as stable product, likely through trichloroacetyl chloride (3, Fig. 1) as an intermediate. This pathway is the main pathway of Per biotransformation in both rodents and humans [7,9­11]; high rates of formation of the peroxisome proliferator trichloroacetic acid in mice have been implicated as a mechanism of Per tumorigenicity to the liver in this species [2].

Glutathione conjugation of Per results in S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione (2, Fig. 1). This pathway is likely responsible for the renal toxicity of Per in rats [7]. S-(1,2,2-Trichlorovinyl)glutathione is nephrotoxic and processed by the enzymes of mercapturic acid formation to S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (5, Fig. 1). This cysteine S-conjugate may either be acetylated to the mercapturic acid N-acetyl-S(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (6, Fig. 1) or cleaved by renal i-lyases to a reactive intermediate, likely dichlorothioketene (7, Fig. 1) [12]. The excretion of N-acetyl-S(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine has been demonstrated in rodents and in humans exposed to Per [7,9,13]. Covalent binding to proteins by the thioketene formed by the i-lyase-mediated cleavage of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine in the kidney has been demonstrated in rats [14]. The ability of the kidney to accumulate S-conjugates biosynthesized from Per and the high concentrations of the enzymes of mercapturic acid formation are important factors contributing to the renal toxicity of Per and its S-conjugates [15].

Despite the demonstration of S-conjugate formation in humans in vivo and in rodents in vivo and in vitro, the ability of human subcellular fractions and possible sex and species differences in the ability of rodent subcellular fraction to catalyze the formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione from Per have not been studied yet. Because of the sex and species differences in the toxic effects of Per on the kidney, quantitative comparisons of the rates of crucial steps in Per metabolism may help to reduce the uncertainties in the assessment of human renal tumor risk after Per exposure.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Chemicals
S-(1,2,2-Trichlorovinyl)glutathione [8] and S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobutadienyl)glutathione [16] were synthesized as described previously. Yield of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione obtained after purification by preparative HPLC was 10% (based on the amount of glutathione used), purity was \ 98% based on HPLC with UV-detection and TLC with ninhydrin-detection. The identity and purity of the compound was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, HPLC, and 13C NMR. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) in the highest purity available.

2.2. Preparation of subcellular fractions
Human liver specimens were obtained from Keystone Skin Bank (Exton, PA) or through the Liver Bank in Kiel, Germany. Human kidney tissue was obtained from kidneys medically unsuited for transplantation and from nontumorous tissue obtained by nephrectomies of renal tumors performed in the University Hospital in Wurzburg. All procedures were performed at 4°C. To minced livers (rats) and tissue ¨ specimens (human), a 3-fold volume (w/v) of 0.154 M KCl was added and tissues were homogenized. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 14000× g for 10 min and the resulting supernatants subjected to centrifugation at 100000× g for 60 min to sediment microsomes. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged again for 60 min at 40000 rpm. The resulting pellet was suspended in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and aliquots of the microsomal preparations were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 70°C. Protein concentrations were determined with a BioRad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. Cytosolic fractions (40 ml) were dialyzed against 2×2 l of 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 24 h at 4°C.

2.3. Incubation conditions
Per was incubated with liver and kidney microsomal and cytosolic proteins (protein concentrations were 1 ­ 8 mg/ml for cytosolic proteins and 1 and 2 mg/ml

for microsomal incubations) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM glutathione in closed vials of 5 ml capacity. Incubation volume was 1 ml. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 37°C in the presence of glutathione. Then the vials were capped with polypropylene cramp seals and the reaction started by the addition of Per (final concentrations from 0.5 to 3 mM) through the septum by a microliter syringe. A concentration of 3 mM of Per was used to obtain saturation of the solutions. Solubility of Per in the buffer was dependent on protein concentrations and type of subcellular fractions used and ranged from 0.9 to 2.6 mmol/l. The reaction was stopped with 20 vl of 70% perchloric acid after 20 or 40 min at 37°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Injection volume was 50 vl. Eluting material was monitored at 263 nm (HewlettPackard Series 1050 UV-detector) and formation of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione was quantified by comparison of the peak areas with calibration curves for authentic material.

2.4. Instrumental analyses
A double-beam spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-2000, Tokyo, Japan) with an accuracy of 90.002 mAU and a reproducibility of 9 0.001 mAU was used for quantitation of the rates of glutathione conjugation of 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in 1-cm plastic cuvettes. Analysis for the quantitation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation was performed by HPLC with a 250×4 mm steel column filled with Partisil ODS-III (5-vm particle size) by gradient elution: solvent A was water, acidified to pH 2 with trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B was methanol, linear gradient from 0 to 100% B in 40 min; flow rate was 1 ml/min. Retention time of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione under these conditions was 19.3 min, limit of detection was determined as 10 pmol of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione injected into the column.

2.5. Mass spectrometry
Mass spectra were recorded with a Finnigan 4500 (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) with a thermospray interface or with a Trio 2000 (Fisons Instruments, Mainz, Germany) with an electrospray interface in the positive ion mode using NH4CH3CO2 buffer (pH 5; 10 mM).

2.6. Determination of glutathione S-transferase acti6ities with 1 -chloro-2,4 -dinitrobenzene and 1,2 -dichloro-4 -nitrobenzene
Assays were performed as described in the literature [17,18]. Protein concentrations were between 0.5 and 2 mg/ml with 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene and 0.02 and 0.05 mg/ml with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate. Incubation of microsomal and cytosolic fractions from rats, mice, and humans with hexachlorobutadiene as substrate were performed as described previously [19] at protein concentrations between 0.5 and 2 mg/ml; hexachlorobutadiene concentrations were 0.5 mM. Rates

of S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobutadienyl)-L-cysteine formation from hexachlorobutadiene were quantified by HPLC under conditions as described above with a detection wavelength of 265 nm, and S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobutadienyl)glutathione formed was quantified by comparison of peak areas with calibration curves using authentic standards.

3. Results

3.1. Identification of S-(1,2,2 -trichloro6inyl)glutathione as a perchloroethene metabolite
When cytosol from the liver of male rats was incubated with Per in the presence of glutathione, HPLC separations of the reaction mixtures showed the time and protein concentration-dependent formation of a new peak (Fig. 2B) identical in retention time and electronic spectrum (not shown) to that of synthetic S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione. This peak was not formed when heat denatured cytosol was used as a source of enzymatic activity or when exogenous glutathione was omitted from the incubation mixtures. Moreover, the formation of this peak was significantly reduced (\ 85%) when incubations were performed in the presence of the competitive glutathione S-transferase substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. This peak was isolated by preparative HPLC and subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry. The spectrum obtained (Fig. 2A) exhibited a major signal at m/z 434 (35Cl) and a minor signal at m/z 456 (35Cl) showing the characteristic isotopic pattern of three chlorine atoms. M/z 434 represents the molecular ion of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione; the peak with m/z 456 is formed by the addition of sodium and the loss of a proton from the molecular ion. An identical spectrum was obtained with synthetic S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione.

3.2. Quantitation of S-(1,2,2 -trichloro6inyl)glutathione formation
The formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione from Per was catalyzed by the cytosolic fractions of rat and mouse liver and kidney, but not by microsomal fractions from these organs. In several independent preparations (n= 4) of cytosol, a significantly (P \0.01) higher rate of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation was consistently observed in cytosol from male rats as compared to female rats (Table 1). Sex differences in the rates of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation were not observed in mouse liver cytosol (Table 1). Apparent Km values of 0.9­1.2 mM for Per were determined in all rodent liver cytosol fractions. In all samples of human liver and kidney cytosol and microsomes available (n= 11), formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione could not be detected despite increases in protein (cytosol) concentrations up to 8 mg/ml and increases in incubation times up to 60 min. Based on the detection limit of the HPLC method, the rates of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation in the available human liver cytosolic fraction were lower than 1 pmol/min per mg.

A total of 50 vl of the supernatant was injected in a 125 mm× 4 mm steel column filled with Partisil ODS-III. Solvent A was water adjusted to pH 2 with trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B was methanol.

3.3. Comparison of human and rat li6er glutathione S-transferase acti6ities
Since formation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione was not demonstrated in the human liver cytosolic fractions available, the capacities of these samples to catalyze the formation of glutathione S-conjugates of several marker substrates were determined and compared with rat and mouse liver cytosol. Conjugation of hexachlorobutadiene was selected because this compound is a polyhalogenated olefin that is nephrotoxic, tumorigenic, and structurally similar to Per [20,21]. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene are standard substrates for the determination of glutathione S-transferase activities [17,22­24]. Enzymatic formation of S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobutadienyl)glutathione from hexachlorobutadiene was observed in all human liver cytosol samples studied with

this substrate; the observed rates were approximately 20­30% of the rates seen in rat and mouse liver cytosol. Hexachlorobutadiene conjugation with glutathione was also catalyzed by microsomal fractions from the liver of male and female rats at rates of 1.1 nmol/min per mg protein (males) and 0.8 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. Human liver microsomal fractions also catalyzed the formation of S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobutadienyl)glutathione from hexachlorobutadiene at rates between 0.3 and 0.8 nmol/min per mg protein (data not shown). No sex differences in the rates of glutathione conjugation were observed with hexachlorobutadiene as a substrate in human, rat, and mouse liver cytosol (Tables 2 and 3). With 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate to determine the total glutathione S-transferase activity of a specific subcellular fraction, similar rates were observed in rat and mouse liver cytosol and no significant sex differences were seen in these species.

zene conjugation were between 30 and 60% of the values observed in rats. Activities of human liver cytosol similar to those seen in this study with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate were also observed by other authors [23,24]. Using 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene as a substrate, rats and mice showed a high capacity of liver cytosol for the conjugation of this substrate with glutathione. Although there were no observable sex differences in the rates of conjugation of 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene in mice, male rats showed 4-fold higher rates for the conjugation of this substrate as compared to female rats. In human liver samples, the protein concentrations of the assays had to be increased from 0.001 to 1 mg/ml to observe enzymatic conjugation of 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene with glutathione. The reaction rates determined in the human liver cytosol samples were therefore two orders of magnitude lower than rates seen in rodent liver. However, the rates seen in our human liver samples are in good agreement with those observed by others for the glutathione conjugation of 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene in human liver cytosol [23].

4. Discussion The data obtained in this study confirm previous information on the in vitro conjugation of Per with glutathione. The rates of formation of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione observed in this study in liver cytosol from male rats were 40% lower than those reported previously in one study [8]. In another study, rates of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation in liver cytosol were similar to

40

those reported here [13]. In addition, a marked sex difference in the rates of glutathione conjugation of Per was found in this study. The rates observed in liver cytosol from female rats were approximately four times lower than in male rats. The exact basis for the differences in S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation from Per in the different studies is not known. The previous studies used radiolabelled Per and quantified the formation of 14C-labeled S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione; a minor radioactive contaminant coeluting with 14C-labeled S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione may be partly responsible for the differences. In agreement with the results presented here, another study also found a significantly higher capacity of liver cytosolic fractions from male rats for the biosynthesis of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione as compared to females [25]. Also, in contrast to previous observations, no contribution of microsomal glutathione S-transferase to glutathione conjugation of Per was observed [8,13]. However, the experiments performed with hexachlorobutadiene, where conjugation to S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobutadienyl)glutathione was catalyzed by the microsomal glutathione S-transferase, indicate that this enzyme was active in the used microsomal fractions. Differences in the preparation of the subcellular fractions (e.g. additional washing steps in the preparation of the microsomes) and/or animals used for obtaining subcellular fractions may be responsible for the differences between the results of these studies. A recent paper also did not find a contribution of microsomal glutathione S-transferase to the conjugation of trichloroethene to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione [26]. The data obtained suggest that differences in the glutathione conjugation of Per between the sexes of rats exist and may influence the extent of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione formed as well as concentrations of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine, which is a substrate for i-lyase, in the kidney. The differences in hepatic conjugation of Per also seem to determine the excretion of S-conjugates in urine after Per inhalation. Male rats excreted significantly higher concentrations of the N-acetyl-S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine than did female rats (Volkel et al., submitted) after inhalation of identical concentrations of Per. ¨ In all human liver cytosol samples studied, S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation was below the limit of detection. Based on the detection limits for S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione in the HPLC assay, the rates for the formation of this S-conjugate in the human liver samples investigated are B 1 pmol/min per mg, and are at least 20-fold lower than in liver cytosol from male rats and 5-fold lower than in liver cytosol from female rats. The human liver samples, however, catalyzed glutathione S-conjugate formation from three marker substrates at rates similar to those reported in the literature [23,27,28]. Therefore, the low rates of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation are unlikely to be based on a loss of glutathione S-transferase activity during preparation or storage and suggest that the capacity of human liver samples for S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione formation from Per is significantly lower than that of rat liver. Differences in the extent of glutathione conjugation of Per between humans and rats also seem be present in vivo. After inhalation exposure of humans and rats to 40 ppm Per for 6 h, rats excreted 10-fold higher levels (expressed as dose in vmol/kg body weight) than

human volunteers. Moreover, the urine of rats contained significant amounts of dichloroacetic acid. Dichloroacetic acid is formed as stable endproduct by cysteine conjugate i-lyase dependent biotransformation of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine. This observation suggests that in rats even larger amounts of the precursor for S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine, S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione, are formed. Dichloroacetic acid was not detected in urine samples of humans exposed to Per under identical conditions (Volkel et al., submitted). ¨ Moreover, the data obtained suggest that different glutathione S-transferases are involved in the glutathione conjugation of hexachlorobutadiene, trichloroethene and Per. No major differences were observed between human liver cytosolic and rat liver cytosolic glutathione S-transferases in their capacity to catalyze the formation of S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachlorobutadienyl)glutathione from hexachlorobutadiene. However, as seen here with Per, the capacity of liver cytosol from male rats to catalyze the formation of S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione from trichloroethene was also more than 10-fold higher than that of human liver cytosol fractions [26]. The much lower capacity of human liver for the biosynthesis of S-(1,2,2trichlorovinyl)glutathione from Per as compared to rodent liver suggests that the extent of biosynthesis of S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione in humans is lower than in rats. S-(1,2,2-Trichlorovinyl)glutathione and the derived S-conjugates are most likely the toxic metabolites responsible for nephrotoxicity and, presumably, tumorigenicity of Per to the kidney of the male rat. The lower capacity of humans to biosynthesize the toxic Per metabolite S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione and the lower activity of cysteine conjugate i-lyase in the human [13,29,30] suggest that the use of rat tumorigenicity data for the assessment of human risk of renal tumors after Per exposure may overestimate the human risk.
