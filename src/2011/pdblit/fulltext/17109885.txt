A protein-mediated mechanism for the DNA sequence-specific action of topoisomerase II poisons
Giovanni Capranico, Monica Binaschi, M. Evelina Borgnetto, Franco Zunino and Manlio Palumbo Chemical agents able to interfere with DNA topoisomerases are widespread in nature, and some of them have outstanding therapeutic efficacy in human cancer and infectious diseases. DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes that govern DNA topology during fundamental nuclear metabolic processes. Topoisomerase-interfering compounds can be divided into two general categories based on the mechanism of drug action: poisons and catalytic inhibitors. In past years, investigations of the DNA sequence selectivity of topoisomerase II poisons have identified structural and molecular determinants of drug activity, and indicated that the drug receptor is likely to be at the protein­DNA interface. Moreover, the available results indicate that the biologically relevant DNA-binding activity of topoisomerase poisons is basically protein-mediated and this is discussed in this issue by Giovanni Capranico and colleagues. This suggests that topoisomerase poisons may represent a useful paradigm for small compounds able to bind to protein­DNA interfaces in a site-selective manner, thus increasing the affinity of DNA-binding proteins for specific genomic sites. DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes that modify the topology of nucleic acids, and have been recently classified into three families: type II, type I-A and type I-B (Refs 1, 2). Each family consists of conserved enzymes that have evolved a different mechanism to manipulate DNA topology. For example, type II topoisomerases, which include the prokaryotic DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and the mammalian topoisomerases II and II , transport a double helix through a doublestranded cut of another DNA helix1,2. In contrast, type I topoisomerases transport a DNA segment through the break of a single-stranded DNA filament. The type I-A family includes bacterial protein, topoisomerases III, and reverse DNA gyrase, while the type I-B includes eukaryotic topoisomerases I (Refs 1­3). Agents able to interfere with these enzymes are known for two of the

three families: type II and type I-B (see Table 1 for a list of the poisons of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases). Several of the known DNA topoisomerase poisons and inhibitors are natural compounds, produced by plants or microbes. These compounds are often highly toxic to other organisms, which suggests that their function is related to the self defence of the producing species. The significance for human health of DNA topoisomerases and compounds that interact with them is rooted in the outstanding clinical efficacy of several topoisomerase poisons such as antitumour or antibacterial drugs. The phenomenon of the poisoning of DNA topoisomerases has been conserved during evolution, probably because it is a very efficient mechanism of cell killing. Moreover, some endogenous cellular compounds such as flavines are structurally similar to the antitumour poison amsacrine and others may be present in our diet. Thus, one may wonder whether endogenous poisons or modulators of DNA topoisomerases are physiologically present in mammalian cells, and whether the modulation or interference with enzyme activities can have further biological significance. Here, recent advances in understanding the action of topoisomerase II poisons are reviewed, with an emphasis on possible applications for finding new sequenceselective agents. In particular, the known mechanisms of drug interaction with DNA topoisomerases, the DNA sequence selectivity of the action of topoisomerase II poisons, and the identification of structural determinants of their activity are discussed. The biologically relevant, sequence-specific DNA binding activity of topoisomerase poisons is fundamentally mediated by the enzyme itself. Finally, we propose that in the search of sequence-specific DNA binders able to repress gene transcription at selected genomic loci, topoisomerase poisons may represent valuable models of lowmolecular-weight compounds that could increase the affinity of DNA-binding proteins for specific genomic sites.

Mechanisms of topoisomerase modulation by low-molecular-weight compounds
The crystal structures of a central portion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II (Ref. 4), and an N-terminal portion of Escherichia coli gyrase B (Ref. 5) have revealed that type II DNA topoisomerase is a heartshaped protein dimer with large holes, into which DNA helices may fit. Binding of ATP to the enzyme triggers conformational protein transitions that can result in the transport of a DNA segment through a DNA break and through the entire interface between the two protein subunits4,6 (see Fig. 1 for a schematic picture of topoisomerase II catalytic cycle). This wealth of structural information is not only helping to understand further the mechanism of these enzymes, but also the mechanisms of drug action. In recent years, the list of compounds that can interfere with DNA topoisomerase II activity has increased

either block its conformational transitions by `freezing' one protein conformation, such as the bisdioxopiperazine derivative, ICRF193 (Ref. 13) (Fig. 1, indicated in green), or inhibit ATP binding to the enzyme, such as coumarins and novobiocin14. Therefore, two subcategories of inhibitors may be distinguished: DNA-binding inhibitors and enzyme-binding inhibitors, respectively. The DNA-binding inhibitors are not specific for topoisomerases because they can prevent DNA binding of several DNA-binding proteins, whereas the enzymebinding inhibitors can be specific inhibitors of these enzymes.

Site selectivity of DNA topoisomerase poisoning
Many, but not all, topoisomerase II poisons are known to be DNA binders (Table 1), and this may have been a contributing factor in generating confusion in first attempts to elucidate their mechanism of action. It is noteworthy that a topoisomerase poison can be characterized by two modes of DNA binding (intercalation and minor-groove binding) (Table 1). However, a deeper understanding of their DNA-binding modes indicates that some agents are `pure intercalators', some are not intercalators but rather minor-groove binders, and some have features of both intercalators and groove binders (Table 1). For anthracyclines, often considered to be `pure intercalators', the groove-binding moiety (the sugar and side-chain) is at least as crucial for drug activity as the planar intercalating moiety15,16. Thus, present knowledge does not support hypotheses on the mechanism of drug action that are based simply on different modes of drug interaction with DNA. A peculiarity of DNA topoisomerase poisons is that their action is invariably DNA-sequence specific: poisons from different chemical classes stimulate drug-specific cleavage-intensity patterns in sequencing gels, i.e. although they might have in common DNA sites of cleavage in a given DNA fragment, relative cleavage intensities vary greatly among different compounds. A high degree of heterogeneity in the localization of topoisomerase II DNA cleavage stimulated by unrelated poisons has also been shown in nuclear chromatin of living cultured cells17. Each drug is thus able to stimulate DNA cleavage at certain sites, but not at all sites recognized by the enzyme, which suggests that effective drug interactions depend on the local base sequence12. Several investigations have revealed that specific nucleotides immediately adjacent to the strand cut (see Fig. 2 for a schematic representation of a topoisomerase II DNA break site) are required for drug stimulation of cleavage. Commonly, topoisomerase II poisons show a preference for a doublet of bases at two consecutive positions from 2 to 2, even though one base constitutes a stronger preference12. Therefore, based on the preferred doublets, several topoisomerase II poisons can be gathered into different groups. Such a classification has been attempted in Table 2: the poisons have been listed on the basis of the primary sequence position preference ( 1,

considerably. The term inhibitor is often used for these compounds regardless of the mechanism of drug action. Many drugs (such as anthracyclines, quinolones, camptothecins, etc., listed in Table 1) stabilize an enzyme­DNA covalent complex and hinder a specific step in the catalytic cycle, i.e. the reclosure of DNA breaks (shown in red in Fig. 1)7­9. This is followed by enhancement of DNA cleavage levels in living cells as well as of DNA fragments with purified topoisomerases10­12. The drugs transform harmless proteins into potent nuclear toxins that lethally damage the double helix: in other words, they act by poisoning DNA topoisomerase10­12. Thus, topoisomerase-targeted agents that stabilize the covalent DNA­enzyme complex could be called poisons instead of inhibitors. In contrast, other compounds do not enhance DNA breakage but inhibit the enzyme catalytic activity (Fig. 1): thus, the definition of inhibitor could be reserved for these compounds only. Catalytic inhibition can occur by a variety of molecular mechanisms: (1) some inhibitors bind to the DNA and consequently impede the access of topoisomerases to DNA sequences that are bound by drugs, such as highaffinity DNA intercalators and groove binders (Fig. 1, indicated in magenta); (2) others bind to the enzyme and

1 or 2), and the secondary base preference (2nd base). These findings led to a model in which poisons form ternary complexes with the DNA and enzyme and are placed at the interface between the DNA-cleavage and enzyme-active sites, in close contact with DNA base pairs adjacent to the cleaved bond11,18. Drug localization in the ternary complex has been shown using a photoactivable amsacrine (mAMSA) analogue19. Upon activation, the compound was found to be covalently linked to DNA bases at the 1 and 1 positions, only when T4 topoisomerase II was present in the reaction mixture. Analogous results have been obtained in the case of camptothecin and topoisomerase I-B (Refs 20, 21). Thus, several independent results show that poison receptors are localized at the protein­DNA interface of the topoisomerase active site.

Molecular determinants of the DNA sequence specificity of antitumour poisons
In recent years, structural and molecular determinants of the sequence-specific action of topoisomerase II poisons have been characterized by investigating the sequence specificity of DNA cleavage stimulation. They include the drug pharmacophore, certain drug chemical substituents, and enzyme subunit cooperativity.

Drug pharmacophore
Interestingly, some structurally unrelated poisons show similar or identical cleavage-intensity patterns in sequencing gels and the same local base preferences (Table 2). In contrast, sequence selectivities of mitoxantrone and doxorubicin were completely different in spite of an apparent structural similarity22. Comparison of energy-minimized drug structures by computer modelling indicated that poisons with the same position sequence specificity, even if chemically unrelated, share the same relative space occupancy of drug moieties and electronic distribution, suggesting a common specific pharmacophore23. The pharmacophore of topoisomerase poisons is composed of distinct domains: a planar ring system that can be identified as a DNA-interacting portion, and side-chain(s), which probably represent enzyme-interacting moiety(ies). Hence, the relative position of these domains should play an important role in defining the sequence position preference of the poison. Altogether, the findings indicate that a main determinant of the sequence position specificity is the particular pharmacophore of the poison. If topoisomerase II poisons have different specific pharmacophores, precise drug receptor sites are likely to be only partly overlapping; streptonigrin is a particularly interesting example24. This compound has a unique sequence specificity since it requires a thymine (or an adenine) at position 2 (or 3) (Table 2), and can have a DNA binding mode similar to that of minor-groove binders24. Therefore, streptonigrin may be placed, in the ternary complex, externally to the DNA, interacting with the T[ 2] in a groove, and interfering with the DNA religation step of the enzyme reaction.

Fig. 1. The catalytic cycle of type II DNA topoisomerases and the sites of action of the inhibitors (magenta and green) and poisons (red) of the eukaryotic enzymes. Topoisomerase II is a protein dimer that undergoes conformational modifications during the catalytic cycle, and consequently opens and closes the in-gate (at the top of the dimer) and the out-gate (at the bottom of the dimer). The catalytic cycle has been represented as a four-step process: (1) the enzyme binds to a DNA helix in a conformation in which the in-gate is open and the out-gate is closed (top, right); (2) upon ATP binding (black circles) the proteins capture a second DNA helix that enters from the in-gate, passes through a cleavage made by the enzyme into the first DNA helix, and finally exits from the out-gate (bottom, right); (3) after strand passage the enzyme reseals the broken DNA helix, and is in a completely closed conformation (bottom, left); (4) ATP hydrolysis triggers the enzyme turnover, and topoisomerase II is again in an open conformation (top, left). DNA-binding inhibitors, such as intercalating agents and groove binders, can impede enzyme binding to the DNA (magenta); poisons hinder DNA break resealing (red); and enzymebinding inhibitors block protein conformational transitions (green). Other enzyme-binding inhibitors, such as novobiocin and coumarins, are known to inhibit ATP binding, and thus act before strand passage (top, right). However, these agents are not represented in the illustration because they are potent inhibitors of the prokaryotic DNA gyrase rather than eukaryotic topoisomerases II.

These data suggest a more elaborate model for the ternary complex. The poison is placed at the protein­ DNA interface of the enzyme active site making contact with DNA base pairs from positions 2 to 2. At least three pharmacophores could bind to this broadly defined receptor: (1) one represented by poisons with 1 position specificity; (2) a second represented by poisons with 1 position specificity; and (3) the third represented by poisons with +2 position specificity (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The three pharmacophores may indeed interact with partially different protein and DNA units, thus at least three partially overlapping receptor sites in the binary DNA­enzyme complex can be distinguished. A hydrophobic pocket in the protein may be easily accessible by unpaired nucleotides at the cleavage site, and may also constitute a high-affinity site for the drug. Such an enzyme pocket resembles the model proposed by Filipski, who hypothesized that base binding sites were present in the active site of topoisomerase II and that a poison molecule could compete with DNA bases for binding to these enzyme pockets 25. In agreement with this hypothesis, and with experimental data indicating interactions of topoisomerase II with several poisons in the absence of DNA (Refs 8, 26), the stacking of drug molecules with DNA bases may

between the analogue and parent drugs was that a guanine, instead of a thymine, was preferred at position 2 by the former (Table 2). These data also indicate that the sugar moiety of anthracycline, placed in the DNA minor groove, interacts with base pairs up to position 2 (Fig. 2)16. More recently, the sequence specificity of the terpenoid clerocidin, a peculiar topoisomerase II poison that lacks even a small planar drug moiety and stimulates salt-resistant DNA cleavage, has been investigated28,29. Clerocidin-dependent irreversible DNA cleavage was site selective and required a guanine at position 1 (Ref. 29). Irreversible sites showed an abnormal electrophoretic mobility in sequencing gels with respect to cleaved bands generated by mAMSA, suggesting a chemical alteration of the DNA strand. This could be due to reaction of the side-chain dicarbonyl function of clerocidin with the guanine at the 1 position in the ternary complex, resulting in cleavage irreversibility and altered DNA mobility in sequencing gels29. These findings demonstrated that specific drug chemical groups may be important structural determinants of preferred base pairs. It is thus possible that certain analogues of other topoisomerase poisons may also exhibit a different pattern of nucleotide preferences as compared with parent drugs.

Enzyme subunit co-operativity
Eukaryotic topoisomerase II subunits appear to act cooperatively during the catalytic reaction while undergoing conformational changes30. It has been shown that subunit co-operativity also occurs during the DNAcleavage step, and that one drug molecule interacting with one enzyme subunit may stimulate a strand cut mediated by the second subunit due to co-operative effects31. This shows that drug action at one subunit may be affected by the action of a second drug molecule acting at the other protein subunit. Consequently, site selectivity of a poison may be influenced, at least partially, by subunit co-operativity in addition to drug structure itself. In the case of amonafide, enzyme subunit co-operativity can have a striking role in the high site selectivity shown by this poison32. This poison stimulates the largest amount of DNA cleavage at only one site in plasmid pBR322 DNA and at two sites in simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA (Ref. 32). Statistical analyses of cleavage site sequences showed that amonafide strongly prefers the doublet 5 CA at positions 1 and 1 (Table 2). However, an inverted repeat sequence was present at the three sites exceptionally stimulated by amonafide, with cytosines and adenines at positions 1 and 1, respectively. A base mutation analysis could rule out the involvement of stem-loop DNA structures in the drug action or in protein DNA interactions, and indicated that exceptionally high levels of cleavage stimulation occurred when amonafide molecules optimally interacted with both enzyme subunits. This, in turn, highly

occur in a hydrophobic environment provided by an enzyme pocket.

Drug substituents
Investigations on anthracycline analogues and clerocidin suggest that specific drug substituents can have a role in determining the preferred base pairs. Closely related drug congeners generally stimulate identical DNA cleavage-intensity patterns and, in the case of anthracyclines, several modifications of the planar ring and/or the daunosamine did not alter doxorubicinspecific intensity patterns of cleavage15,27. However, a daunorubicin derivative with the 3 -NH2 of daunosamine is the axial configuration stimulated topoisomerase II DNA cleavage with different cleavage intensity patterns in agarose and sequencing gels with respect to the parent drug16: the major difference

Protein-mediated DNA sequence specificity of topoisomerase II poisons
The wealth of structural and molecular data on topoisomerase poisons urges a fundamental change in the perspective in which drug action is viewed. The sequence specificity of the action of topoisomerase II poisons is essentially determined through protein interactions, and consequently, their DNA binding activity is qualitatively, and even quantitatively, novel in the ternary complex. Two general considerations support this view. First, poisons that are not DNA binders (Table 1) show a base-specific type of interaction with DNA in the ternary complex. For example, the terpenoid clerocidin appears to interact covalently with guanines at 1 positions of the cleavage sites29. Teniposide (VM-26) shows a strong preference for cytosines at positions 1, suggesting poison­nucleotide contacts in the ternary complex22,33. Moreover, in the presence of a DNA topoisomerase I-B, a photoactivable camptothecin analogue remains covalently linked to DNA bases immediately adjacent to the cleaved bond upon light activation, again demonstrating a close proximity of the poison to specific nucleotides in the ternary complex21. Second, the sequence specificity of the binding to naked DNA has been extensively investigated for poisons that are DNA binders. The majority of these compounds interact preferentially to defined sequence contexts of the nucleic acid, the effects being modulated by the nature of bases flanking the binding site. In general, the efficiency of discrimination is moderate, the ratio of affinities between sites ranging within less than one order of magnitude. Intercalators select alternating pyrimidine­purine sites, and in some cases exhibit additional preference for a third flanking base; this is the case for anthracyclines and mitoxantrone for which preferred triplets have been identified34,35. Interestingly, sequences specifically bound by some of these poisons do not correspond to sequences

preferred for topoisomerase II poisoning. For example, anthracyclines prefer to intercalate into 5 -GC doublets preceded by A or T (Refs 36, 37); the preference of GC is due to a favoured stacking between the drug chromophore and these base pairs at the intercalation site, while the preference of A/T at the preceding base is due to steric interference of the sugar amino group of the drug with the amino group of guanines in the DNA minor groove36. In contrast, for an effective topoisomerase poisoning activity doxorubicin strongly prefers 5 -TAA, with the strand cut between the two As (Refs 18, 31). Only the T preference is shared by the two molecular actions of anthracyclines, i.e. binding to naked DNA and to topoisomerase­DNA complexes, and can be interpreted similarly16. Another example is streptonigrin, which efficiently damages GC-rich regions of DNA helices in the presence of Cu2+ (Ref. 38), whereas it stimulates topoisomerase II DNA cleavage at sites with 5 -TA at positions 2 and 3 (Ref. 24), suggesting an interaction with these nucleotides in the ternary complex. However, in other cases, such as mAMSA, a 5 -TA ( 1 and 1 positions) preference shown for cleavage stimulation (Table 2) is in agreement with the specificity of drug binding to naked DNAs (Ref. 39). In summary, DNA­poison interactions are determined by the protein, since non-DNA-binder poisons show base preferences and, in several other cases, sequence preferences of poison binding to naked DNA are different from those found for topoisomerase poisoning activity. This is understandable, as the protein generates major structural modifications of the double helix while producing and resealing the DNA gate. Thus, a stabilized enzyme­poison­DNA complex must be at a stage in which enzyme tyrosine residues are covalently linked to 5 DNA termini and attempt to get close to the 3 hydroxyl DNA ends ( 1 positions) to carry out the transesterification process that restores intact DNA strands. Hence, the drug­DNA interactions must be qualitatively changed as compared with an unbroken double helix, due to the activity of topoisomerase II. The

Hence, for a reasonable value of m = 2 (as observed for topoisomerase II poisons, see Table 2), sequence-specific recognition would be improved 16-fold. Taking into account that many DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA as dimers, the sequence specificity of the ternary DNA­drug­protein complex could be two orders of magnitude higher than that of the protein alone. There are several proteins that bind DNA following activation by a low-molecular-weight ligand; these include the prokaryotic class of amino acid repressors, the large family of eukaryotic nuclear receptors, the catabolite gene-activator protein, and others40­42. In several of these cases, it is thought that DNA binding activation is achieved by protein conformational changes triggered by the ligand. However, different mechanisms may operate in other cases41. Interestingly, the E. coli trp repressor binds to the operator DNA sequence upon binding of L-tryptophan that orients the flexible helix­turn­helix motif so as to penetrate the major groove of the operator40. Nevertheless, in crystal structures of repressor/operator complexes, L-tryptophan has been shown to contact amino acid residues as well as the DNA backbone40,43, resembling the interaction mode of topoisomerase poisons at the protein­DNA interface. Several nuclear proteins bind to the minor groove of a duplex DNA with some preferences for AT-rich sites44,45. In particular, it is interesting to note that both distamycin, a low-molecular-weight compound, and High Mobility Group I/Y (HMG-I/Y) proteins bind to AT-rich sequences and interact similarly with the minor-groove of a double helix45,46. In addition, in vivo effects of distamycin and HMG-I/Y proteins have been shown to be very similar, with particular reference to nuclear chromatin accessibility to topoisomerase II and other DNA-binding proteins47,48. Structural investigations have shown that the groove-binding domain of HMG-I/Y proteins closely resembles distamycin structure and conformation45. Therefore, it seems that, in nature itself, small molecules have been used frequently to achieve sequencespecific DNA-binding activity. For HMG-I/Y proteins, one might think of the low-molecular-weight compound as being incorporated into the primary amino acid sequence of the protein. Thus, it is possible that the protein-mediated mode of DNA binding of topoisomerase poisons is more common than presently recognized and that the search of agents endowed with such an activity may be a fruitful endeavour.

Fig. 3. Protein-dependent mechanism of DNA binding by low-molecular-weight compounds can result in a highly site-specific stabilization of protein­DNA complexes. A DNA-binding protein (shown as a dimer) can translocate along a DNA segment and can bind specifically to distinct sites (shown in blue and green). Both sites A and B match to the same loose consensus; however, their base sequences are not identical. A drug molecule (red) may have affinity for the protein­DNA complex, binding to a receptor placed at the protein­DNA interface, only when the protein sits at site B, but not when it sits at site A. The drug action would thus result in the stabilization of a protein­DNA complex specifically at site B.

poison may thus have a previously unrecognized, novel type of molecular interaction, i.e. the ability to bind at the protein­DNA interface that is not simply the sum of drug binding to each of the two components alone (if any). This binding mechanism is the one that is relevant for the pharmacological and biological activities of these compounds.

A prototype for low-molecular-weight DNA binders endowed with high DNA sequence specificity
The available information on topoisomerase poisons foresees a novel approach to develop sequence-specific DNA binders that can repress gene transcription at selected genomic loci. In this respect, the requirement that the compound must have a very high site selectivity and a low-molecular weight could be a potential obstacle. Topoisomerase poisons may represent a valuable paradigm of low-molecular-weight compounds able to target selected genomic sites by binding to and increasing the stability of DNA­protein complexes. This may eventually result in the shut-down of the transcription of few genes, or even a single one. In this scenario, a high sequence specificity could be achieved by a two-step process. First, a DNA-binding protein, such as a transcription factor, binds to specific DNA sites of several base pairs. These sites do not share the same exact sequence, but the sequence of each site generally corresponds to a loose consensus. Second, a drug might bind to the DNA­protein complex formed at certain sites only, based on a short sequence preferred by the drug in interacting with both the protein and the DNA (Fig. 3). This may result in a high degree of sequence selectivity. Loose consensus sequences are usually characterized by some invariant and some variable positions. If any of the four principle bases is accepted at each of n variable positions, the number of equivalent target sites for a DNA binding protein will correspond to 4n. Now, a drug molecule able to introduce specificity on m of the n variable positions will reduce the number of target sites in a ternary (DNA­drug­protein) complex by a factor of 4m.

Concluding remarks
Starting from available three-dimensional structures of known enzyme­DNA complexes, novel low-molecular-weight compounds could be rationally designed to increase dramatically the specificity of nucleic-acid­ protein interactions through the formation of a ternary complex with low-molecular-weight agents. A stabilization of appropriate protein­DNA complexes could then result in the repression of selected genes. It is hoped that

R
a thorough understanding of protein­protein and protein­DNA interactions, together with the major increase in crystallographic data of DNA-binding protein structures expected in the next few years, will provide the necessary background for such developments. One may also envisage the design of an agent able to bind specifically to DNA­protein mutant complexes. This may add further specificity to drug action. The mutant protein could be either a mutated protein form found in cancer cells or in other diseases, or a protein mutated in vitro. In the former case, it would lead to an increased pharmacological selectivity. In the latter case, the protein might be used together with the sequenceselective agent to achieve the specific change in gene expression patterns, and could be delivered to the cells by gene therapy methods. Recently, powerful tools have been developed based on in vitro evolution techniques that allow to `irrationally' design novel polypeptides with pre-defined and selectable phenotypes49,50. Therefore, the development of novel compounds targeted to DNA­protein interfaces and endowed with an important biological or pharmacological activity might be based on `designing' at the same time low-molecularweight agents as well as DNA-binding proteins in a process of mutual and continued feedbacks. Undoubtedly, a number of problems must be solved to finally achieve gene-targeted specificity by a low-molecular-weight agent. Here, a new general strategy based on the current knowledge of the action and sequencespecific DNA binding activity of topoisomerase II poisons has been highlighted. Such a strategy will represent a major challenge for future research efforts in the field.
