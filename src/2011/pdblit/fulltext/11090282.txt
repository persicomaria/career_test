The electron transfer system of the biphenyl dioxygenase BphA, which is derived from Acidovorax sp. (formally Pseudomonas sp.) strain KKS102, is composed of an FAD-containing NADH-ferredoxin reductase (BphA4) and a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (BphA3). Biochemical studies have suggested that the whole electron transfer process from NADH to BphA3 comprises three consecutive elementary electron-transfer reactions, in which BphA3 and BphA4 interact transiently in a redox-dependent manner. Initially, BphA4 receives two electrons from NADH. The reduced BphA4 then delivers one electron each to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the two BphA3 molecules through redox-dependent transient interactions. The reduced BphA3 transports the electron to BphA1A2, a terminal oxygenase, to support the activation of dioxygen for biphenyl dihydroxylation. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the sequential reaction and the redox-dependent interaction between BphA3 and BphA4, we determined the crystal structures of the productive BphA3­BphA4 complex, and of free BphA3 and BphA4 in all the redox states occurring in the catalytic cycle. The crystal structures of these reaction intermediates demonstrated that each elementary electron transfer induces a series of redox-dependent conformational changes in BphA3 and BphA4, which regulate the interaction between them. In addition, the conformational changes induced by the preceding electron transfer seem to induce the next electron transfer. The interplay of electron transfer and induced conformational changes seems to be critical to the sequential electron-transfer reaction from NADH to BphA3.

383 and a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (BphA3). Our earlier crystal structure analyses showed that BphA4 is composed of three domains, namely, an FAD-binding (residues 1­111 and 238­317), an NADH-binding (residues 112­237) and a C-terminal (residues 318­408) domain (Figure 1(a) and (b)).8

Introduction
Intermolecular electron transfer, which is a fundamental process in many biological pathways including photosynthesis and multi-component oxygenase systems, typically involves four steps: reduction of the electron donor protein; association of the electron donor and acceptor proteins; electron transfer between the redox centers within the complex; and dissociation of the electron acceptor protein from the electron donor protein. In this sequential process, the association and dissociation of the redox partners are likely to be regulated by the redox state of each protein, and this regulation seems to be critical for sequential electron transfer reactions.1 Understanding the mechanism of this regulation at atomic resolution has been one of the major challenges in the field of intermolecular electron transfer research. Analyses of redox protein complexes typically show that these proteins interact through small hydrophobic patches.1 Residues outside the hydrophobic patch are frequently involved in the electrostatic interaction between redox partners.1 It has been suggested that a small interacting area is required for the interaction between them to be sufficiently weak and transient. Analysis of the crystal structures of redox protein complexes has revealed the low geometrical complementarity between the interacting surfaces, which seems to facilitate fast dissociation.2 Ferredoxins are well-known electron transporters. They are found in bacteria, plants, and higher animals. Ferredoxins can be categorized into a few families. The structure of the plant-type ferredoxin, for example, is quite different from that of the Riesketype ferredoxin. Each ferredoxin (Fdx) has its redox partner, ferredoxin reductase (FNR). Structural studies of the two distinct families of the Fdx­FNR complexes, namely ferredoxin­ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase complexes from maize3 and cyanobacterium,4 and the adrenodoxin (Adx)­adorenodoxin reductase (AdR) complex from bovine,5 have revealed that they share certain features of protein­ protein interaction found in many redox­protein complexes.1,2 However, these structural features alone cannot explain the redox-dependent interaction of redox proteins,1 and, more importantly, cannot explain the regulatory mechanism of the reaction sequence. This is partly because there are no structural analyses for the series of reaction intermediates in the electron transfer reaction. In order to elucidate the mechanism of the redox-dependent affinity regulation on the basis of three-dimensional structures, we initiated crystal structure analyses of BphA4 (NADHferredoxin reductase) and BphA3 (Rieske-type ferredoxin) from the biphenyl dioxygenase BphA, which is derived from a polychlorinated-biphenyl degrading bacterium, Acidovorax sp. strain KKS102.6­8 The BphA system is composed of an electron transfer system and a terminal oxygenase (BphA1A2). The electron transfer system comprises an FAD-containing NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductase (BphA4)

(d) Spectral changes of BphA4 (wildtype) in the turnover phase and the following oxidation phase. BphA4 was rapidly mixed with NADH in the presence of ferricyanide. Initial concentrations of the reaction mixture of BphA4, NADH, and ferricyanide were 10 M, 0.5 mM, and 1.5 mM, respectively. The arrows indicate the direction of the spectral change. The time course of the absorbance change at 600 nm is shown in the inset.

384 BphA4 has essentially the same fold as that of glutathione reductase.8 Putidaredoxin reductase9 and adrenodoxin reductase10 belong to the same family, although the adrenodoxin reductase lacks the C-terminal domain. The crystal structure analysis of BphA3 showed that it has a typical Rieske-type ferredoxin fold.11 The electron transfer reaction of the BphA system begins with the reduction of BphA4 by NADH. BphA4 accepts two electrons from NADH as a hydride and then transfers one electron each to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of two BphA3 molecules. BphA3 shuttles between BphA4 and BphA1A2 to transport electrons. BphA1A2 then catalyzes the dihydroxylation of biphenyl compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls using the two electrons transferred by BphA3. It has been suggested that the interaction between BphA3 and BphA4 is regulated in a redox-dependent manner for efficient electron transfer. Here, we show biochemically, that the interaction between BphA3 and BphA4 is regulated in a redoxdependent manner. Then, the crystal structure of the electron transfer intermediate complex between BphA3 and BphA4 was determined. In addition, the crystal structures of free BphA3 in the oxidized and reduced forms, and free BphA4 in the hydroquinone (two-electron reduced), blue-semiquinone (one-electron reduced), and oxidized forms were determined. The redox-dependent conformational changes of these two proteins explained the molecular mechanisms of the redox-dependent interaction between BphA3 and BphA4. In addition, these crystal structures suggested that the conformational changes caused by the preceding electron transfer reaction induce the subsequent electron transfer. This interplay of electron transfer and induced conformational changes seems to be critical to the sequential reaction of the electron transfer from NADH to BphA3. Here, where necessary, the redox state of each molecule is shown in parentheses using the signs ox, rd, and sq for oxidized, hydroquinone, and semiquinone forms, respectively. The semiquinone form implies here the blue-semiquinone form. The signs ox and rd are also used for oxidized and reduced forms of BphA3, respectively. The bound ligand is given in parentheses after the sign of the redox state. For example, two-electron reduced BphA4 in complex with NAD + is represented as BphA4(rd, NAD+).

stopped-flow experiments, was 526(±6) s-1 (Figure app 1(c)). The significant difference between kcat and app kred values suggested that the rate-limiting step of the reaction is in the oxidative half-reactions. When the steady-state reaction was monitored by the UVvis absorption of BphA4, an intermediate showing a typical blue-semiquinone type absorption spectrum was steadily formed (Figure 1(d)), indicating that the rate-limiting step of the reaction is oxidation of the blue-semiquinone form. When BphA4 was reduced with NADH in the absence of BphA3 and ferricyanide under anaerobic conditions, a broad charge-transfer band appeared in the range from 650 nm to 800 nm, suggesting that molecular species of the two-electron reduced form (hydroquinone form) exist in the reaction cycle. The photo-reduction of BphA4 in the presence of NAD+ also showed the broad charge-transfer band. Based on these results, we could propose a reaction-cycle model for BphA4 (Figure 1(c)). Redox-dependent interaction between BphA4 and BphA3 On the basis of the steady-state kinetic data of BphA4, we supposed a reaction model in which BphA3(ox) interacts preferentially with BphA4 in the hydroquinone and semiquinone forms (Figure 2(a)). To confirm this notion, the interactions of immobilized BphA3 with BphA4 were examined using a pull-down assay under anaerobic conditions (Figure 2(b)). Significantly larger amounts of BphA4 were recovered from the immobilized BphA3 when the immobilized BphA3 was incubated with NADHreduced BphA4 (Figure 2(b), lane 1). This result indicates that reduced BphA4 has a higher affinity for BphA3 than oxidized BphA4. In order to further examine this redox-dependent interaction quantitatively, BphA3-binding curves of dithionite-reduced BphA4 and oxidized BphA4 were obtained by microscale frontal gel chromatography under reducing and oxidized conditions, respectively (Figure 2(c)).12,13 Dithionite-reduced BphA4 (BphA4(rd)) showed about 20-fold higher affinity to BphA3 (Kd = 14.6(±5.9) M) compared to BphA4 in the oxidized form (Kd = 294(±78) M) (Figure 2(d)). It is probable that BphA3 is mainly in the reduced form under the reducing experimental conditions used in the present frontal chromatography experiment. Therefore, further experiments are necessary to assess the affinity of BphA4(rd) for BphA3(ox). Taking these results together, it is suggested that the redox state of BphA4 strongly affects its interaction with BphA3. Crystal structure determinations In order to elucidate the regulation mechanism of the redox-dependent interaction between BphA3 and BphA4, we determined the crystal structure of each redox species of BphA311,14 and BphA4 shown in the reaction scheme (Table 1; Figure 2(a)). The redox states of the FADs in the BphA4 crystals were

385 the crystal structure of the BphA3­BphA4 complex at 1.9 Å resolution (Table 1). The complex was crystallized from anaerobic mixtures of oxidized BphA3 and NADH-reduced BphA4, which contained both hydroquinone and semiquinone forms.15 We failed to crystallize the complex from a mixture of oxidized BphA3 and oxidized BphA4, suggesting that the initial formation of the complex between oxidized BphA3 and NADH-reduced BphA4 is important for obtaining sufficient amounts of stable complex. Thus, the crystal structure of the BphA3­BphA4 complex should give us insight into the molecular mechanisms of the redox-dependent interaction between BphA3 and BphA4. Redox-dependent conformational changes of BphA4 The comparison of the four crystal structures of free BphA4 in different redox states, namely oxidized, hydroquinone, semiquinone, and re-oxidized forms, revealed the redox-dependent conformational changes of BphA4. There are four major conformational changes: a butterfly-like movement of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Figure 3(b)); a flip of the ribityl chain of FAD (Figure 3(c)); a shift of the backrest sub-domain (residues 46­65); and a rotation of the NAD-binding and C-terminal domains (Figure 3(d)). These conformational changes are triggered by reduction of FAD, and are related to one another as described below. The butterfly-like movement of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD was observed in a single turnover of BphA4 (Figure 3(b)). In the resting state (BphA4 (ox, -)), the isoalloxazine ring of FAD assumes a planar conformation (Figure 3(b)). The reduction of BphA4 by NADH induces a bend by about 10° at both N5 and N10 of FAD (hereinafter referred to as N5FAD and N10FAD, respectively; see Figure 3(c)) (Figure 3(b)), suggesting that both N5FAD and N10FAD are in an sp3 configuration in the BphA4 (rd, NAD + ). In the semiquinoid form BphA4 (BphA4(sq, NAD + )), N5FAD changes to an sp2 configuration while N10FAD maintains an sp3 configuration, resulting in a skewed conformation of the isoalloxazine ring (Figure 3(b)). The isoalloxazine ring is returned to a planar conformation upon reoxidation of BphA4 (BphA4(ox, NAD+)) showing nearly the same conformation as observed in the resting state BphA4(ox, -) (Figure 3(b)). These conformational changes of the isoalloxazine ring are likely to be induced by the change of the redox state of FAD, since a bend of the reduced isoalloxazine ring has been proposed both theoretically and experimentally.16­21 The present crystal structures visually demonstrated the progression of the butterfly-like movement of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. It is of note that the sp3 configuration of N10FAD appears to induce a flip of the ribityl chain of FAD in hydroquinone and semiquinone forms of BphA4 (Figure 3(c)). Since the ADP moiety of FAD is tightly fixed in the FAD-binding domain, the configuration

Black arrows show the direction of the rotation.

change of N10FAD from sp2 to sp3 seems to cause structural strain to accumulate in the ribityl chain. A flip of the ribityl chain seems to be necessary to release the strain in the hydroquinone and semiquinone forms of BphA4. As a result of the ribityl chain flip, the C1* atom of FAD (C1*FAD) shifts backward by approximately 2 Å, which leads to a van der Waals interaction with Pro49A4 (Figure 4(a)). The redox-dependent conformational and chemical structure changes of FAD cause a conformational change of Lys53A4 (Figure 4(a)). This conformational change induces a backward shift of the backrest subdomain, which interacts with the NADH-binding domain in a backrest-shaped structure (Figure 1(b)). In the oxidized (or resting) state, the side-chain of Lys53A4 forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds with N5FAD and O4FAD to tether the backrest sub-domain to FAD. Upon FAD reduction, the bifurcated hydro-

gen bonds are broken (Figure 4(a)), due to hydride transfer to N5FAD. Because the tethering between the backrest sub-domain and FAD is lost in the hydroquinone and semiquinone forms of BphA4, the above described van der Waals interaction between C1*FAD and Pro49A4, which is in the backrest subdomain, easily induces the backward shift of the backrest sub-domain (Figure 4(a)). Partial digestion studies on reduced BphA4 and the Lys53A4Met mutant also suggested that the breakage of the hydrogen bond between Lys53A4 and FAD seems to increase the mobility of the backrest sub-domain (Figure 4(b)). The backward shift of the backrest sub-domain in the hydroquinone and semiquinone states induces conformational change in the NADH-binding and C-terminal domains. The shift of the backrest domain induces rigid-body shifts of helices 3

388

(Figure 4(c)). The shifts of the two helices, in turn, induce the rotation of the NADH and C-terminal domains (Figure 4(c)). In BphA4(rd, NAD+) and BphA4(sq, NAD+ ), the NADH-binding and Cterminal domains rotate as a single rigid-body unit (hereinafter called the NADH/CT domain) by about 1.5° (clockwise) with respect to the FAD-binding domain (Figures 3(d) and 4(c)). It is of note that reoxidation of BphA4 induced an anticlockwise rotation of the NADH/CT domain by 1.5° (Figure 3(d)), which was induced by the recovery of the bifurcated hydrogen bonds between FAD and Lys53A4 and the forward shift of C1*FAD. NAD+ binding The conformations of NAD + in BphA4(rd, NAD+ ), BphA4(sq, NAD+), and Bph4(ox, NAD+) differ from one another. In BphA4(rd, NAD+), the nicotinamide ring does not form a stacking interaction with the isoalloxazine ring (Figure 5(a)), which is consistent with a weak broad absorption band around 600 nm­800 nm (Figures 3(a) and 5(b)). The broad absorption band is a characteristic of a FADH - ­NAD + charge­transfer complex, which was observed for BphA4(rd, NAD+ ) solution at pH 7.0 (Figure 5(b)). This suggests that the conformation of the nicotinamide ring in the BphA4(rd, NAD+ ) crystal is different from that at pH 7.0, the condition at which kinetic experiments were carried out. At pH 5.4, the condition at which the crystals were grown, the N1 atom of the fully reduced FAD is probably protonated,22 resulting in the loss of electrostatic interaction between the isoalloxazine ring and the nicotinamide ring. The crystal packing might also cause the "out" conformation of NAD+. In solution, interaction between the isoalloxazine ring and the nicotinamide ring in BphA4(rd, NAD+) might induce a larger rotation of the NADH/CT domain than that observed in the crystal. The rotation of the NADH/CT domain seemed to be restricted in the crystal due to the crystal packing. The high temperature factor of the nicotinamide ring suggests its mobile character. The Fo-Fc simulatedannealing (SA)-omit map of contour level 2.0 showed that the nicotinamide ring adopted a flat conformation, suggesting that NAD+ was bound to the hydroquinone form BphA4. In BphA4(sq, NAD+), the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ interacts with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (Figure 5(c) and (d)). The Fo-Fc SA-omit map shows the flat feature of the nicotinamide ring, suggesting that the NAD + was bound to BphA4 in the semiquinone form. The distance between N5 of the isoalloxazine ring and C4 of the nicotinamide ring is approximately 3.1 Å, which is nearly the same as the corresponding distance of spinach FNR in complex with NADP+.23 In BphA4, the nicotinamide ring is nearly parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, while the corresponding angle in the spinach FNR was approximately 30°.23 In BphA4(ox, NAD+), only the electron density for the ADP moiety of NAD+ was observed; that of the

nicotinamide nucleoside moiety could not be observed. The crystal structure of BphA4(ox, NAD+) suggests that close contact between the nicotinamide nucleoside moiety and C1* of FAD(ox) can dislocate the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+. It is of note that the sp3 configuration of N10FAD in BphA4 (sq, NAD+) seems to cause the displacement of C1* of FAD, preventing close contact between C1* of

FAD and the nicotinamide nucleoside moiety of NAD+ in the semiquinone state (Figure 5(d)). Redox-dependent conformational changes of BphA3 A structural comparison of the oxidized and reduced forms of free BphA3 revealed that the

390 reduction of BphA3 induces a flip of the peptide bond between Gly46A3 and Glu47A3 (Figure 6). The flip causes a shift of the side-chain of Glu47A3 by approximately 6 Å (Figure 6). In addition, the oxidized form conformation of the peptide bond was recovered in the crystal structure of BphA3 when the reduced form BphA3 crystal was autooxidized under aerobic conditions (data not shown).14 Thus, we concluded that the observed flip of the peptide bond is a redox-dependent conformational change. Similar flips of the peptide chain have been reported in ferredoxin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC711924 and putidaredoxin from Pseudomonas putida,25 which belong to the distinct ferredoxin family of BphA3. These flips have been reasonably explained by the repulsion between the negative charge of the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster and the negatively charged carbonyl oxygen (C_O) of the flipped peptide.24,25 In addition, a charge dipole attraction between the NH group of the peptide bond and the [2Fe-2S] cluster also occurs due to the peptide bond flip.

Crystal Structures of Electron Transfer Intermediates

Two earlier examples24,25 showed that the carbonyl oxygen that flips upon reduction is located approximately 3 Å apart form the S atom of the [2Fe2S] cluster in the oxidized state. Upon the [2Fe-2S] cluster reduction, the distance between carbonyl oxygen and the S atom increases by about 2.5 Å due to the peptide bond flip. Since the distance between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly46 and the S atom of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in BphA3(ox) is 4.2 Å, which is significantly larger than that in previous examples, the effect of the electrostatic repulsion seems to be smaller than those observed previously. However, the conformation of the peptide bond between Gly46A3 and Glu47A3 seems to be unstable in the reduced form due to the charge­dipole repulsion with the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Since the flip of the peptide bond exchanges the positions of the Glu47A3-NH and Gly46A3-C_O and changes the direction of the dipole against the charge (Figure 6), the flipped conformation of the peptide bond could be stabilized as observed in the earlier examples. This stabilization might cause the flip of the peptide bond.

The FAD and the Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster are shown as space-filling models (FAD, orange; [2Fe-2S] cluster, pink). BphA3 is shown in pink.

(b) The absorption spectrum of the BphA3­BphA4 mixture solution (BphA3: 61.2 M; BphA4 53 M in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 5.6 mM NADH (pH 7.0)) is shown in red. The absorption spectra from oxidized (green) and reduced (blue) BphA3 (BphA3 61.2 M in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 1.9 mM dithionite (pH 7.0)) are also shown.

Comparison of the two maps suggests that the peptide bond between Gly46A3 and Glu47A3 in the complex adopted the reduced-form conformation. Since the crystal of the BphA3­BphA4 complex was perfectly twinned, it was difficult to obtain the simulated annealing omit map for this region, which has relatively high temperature factors.

391 NADH molecules, the ADP and ribose moieties, adopt nearly the same conformation as that observed in the BphA4(sq, NAD+) structure. After the acceptance of one electron, the reduced BphA3 must dissociate from BphA4 to shuttle the electron to the terminal oxygenase BphA1A2 (Figure 2(a)). Under the present crystallization conditions, substantial amounts of the BphA3­ BphA4 complex were stably formed to allow crystallization of the complex, probably because the concentrations of BphA3 (420 M) and BphA4 (350 M) used for the crystallization were sufficiently high to produce the required amounts of the complex (see the Kd values in Figure 2(d)). Interaction between BphA3 and BphA4 In the complex, BphA3 interacts with the concave surface of BphA4 with an interacting surface area of 693 Å2 (Figures 7(a) and 8(a)). The FAD-binding and C-terminal domains of BphA4 have interacting surface areas for BphA3 of 276 Å2 and 417 Å2, respectively. There is no van der Waals contact between BphA3 and the NADH-binding domain. The packing geometry analysis with the packing efficiency,26 which can be determined by calculating the volume (V) of buried atoms in the protein­ protein interface and comparing it with the mean volume (V0) occupied by equivalent atoms in the protein interior, suggested that the interface between BphA3 and BphA4 is well packed (the V/V0 ratio for fully buried atoms was 1.00).2,26 This V/V0 value suggests that the packing of the BphA3­BphA4 interface is better than other redox proteins.2 There are two major interaction surfaces on BphA4 for BphA3 binding (Figure 8(a)). The first interacting surface is composed of Trp291 A4 , Trp318A4, and Trp320A4. Trp291A4 interacts hydrophobically with Pro80A3 and Pro81A3. Trp318A4 interacts with the side-chain of Met67A3. Trp320A4 make a weak ­ interaction with His66A3. The second interaction surface is composed of helix 8 of BphA4 (from Ala371A4 to Ala382A4 in the C-terminal domain) and its neighboring residues such as Gln329A4. This surface interacts with residues 52 to 65 of BphA3 (Figure 8(a)). The second interaction has a rather electrostatic character. The surface of helix 8 and its neighbor is positively charged, and the respective interacting surface of BphA3 is negatively charged (Figure 8(b)). There are three hydrogen bonds in the second interaction surface (Table 2). BphA3 and BphA4 interact through a small hydrophobic patch, which is surrounded by electrostatic interactions (Figure 8(b)). This interaction mode is similar to that of other redox protein complexes.1,2 Electron transfer pathway in the complex between BphA3 and BphA4 In the BphA3­BphA4 complex, FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster are approximately 10 Å apart. The distance

Crystal structure of the BphA3-BphA4 complex and the redox states of each protein In the crystal of the BphA3­BphA4 complex, BphA3 binds to one subunit of homo-dimeric BphA4 (Figure 7(a)). Initially, the redox state of each protein was analyzed on the basis of the crystal structure and redox state of the BphA3­BphA4 solution used in the crystallization. The absorption spectrum of the BphA3­BphA4 stock solution (pH 7.0) used in the crystallization showed an absorption band at 520 nm, characteristic for reduced BphA3, and a broad absorption around 600 nm­800 nm, characteristic for the charge­transfer complex of BphA4 (rd, NAD+), suggesting that both BphA3 and BphA4 were mainly in the reduced forms before mixing with the crystallization solution (Figure 7(b)). BphA3 in the crystal showed the conformation characteristic of the reduced form; a flip of the peptide bond between Gly46A3 and Glu47A3 (Figure 7(c)) was observed. Since BphA3 in the BphA3­ BphA4 solution used for the crystallization was also in the reduced form, we concluded that BphA3 in the complex crystal was in the reduced form. As for the redox state of BphA4 in the crystalline complex, conflicting observations were obtained. First of all, the redox states of the two BphA4 subunits seemed to be different. In the BphA3-free subunit (the left subunit in Figure 7(a)), the omitmap electron density for the isoalloxazine ring and ribityl chain suggested that the FAD was in the oxidized form. The omit map for Lys53A4 suggested that Lys53A4 forms a hydrogen bond with FAD as observed in the BphA4(ox, -) structure (see Figure 4(a)). These facts suggested that this BphA4 subunit was in the oxidized form. The redox state of the BphA3-bound subunit (the right subunit of Figure 7(a)) seemed to be different from that of the oxidized form. The omit-map electron density for Lys53A4 in this subunit could not be observed, suggesting that Lys53A4 does not interact with FAD. This fact suggested that the FAD in this subunit was in the hydroquinone/semiquinone form. On the other hand, the crystallographic refinement showed that the isoalloxazine ring of FAD in this subunit adopted a flat conformation, suggesting that the FAD was in the oxidized form (see Materials and Methods). Therefore, the BphA3bound subunit showed features of both the reduced and oxidized forms. It is of note that the omit-map electron densities for the ribityl chain and isoalloxazine ring were rather poor (Figure 7(d)), although the omit-map electron density for the ADP portion of FAD was clearly observed. This fact seems to suggest that, in the BphA3-bound subunit of BphA4, some FAD molecules are in reduced states and others are in oxidized states. Electron densities for NAD+ (or NADH) were found in each of the two BphA4 subunits in the complex. Since the nicotinamide ring could not be observed in either binding site, redox states of the nicotinamide moiety, namely NADH or NAD+, could not be determined. The visible portions of the two NAD+/

between the Fe (FE2) atom of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and O4 of FAD is 9.3 Å, the shortest distance between the two redox partners. It is intriguing to note that two aromatic residues, Trp320A4 and His66A3, are located on the shortest path between FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster (Figure 8(c)). The two aromatic rings, therefore, seem to be involved in the electron transfer between FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Since Trp320A4 is completely conserved among the related FNR and Fdx proteins8 it is reasonable to predict that Trp320A4

serves an important role in the electron transfer reaction. Conformational changes of BphA3 and BphA4 in the complex Structural comparison between the free and complex forms of BphA3 and BphA4 revealed three significant conformational changes occurring in the formation of the complex. The first is the

393 forms (clockwise rotation by approximately 1.5°). To obtain crystals of the complex, it was necessary to mix NADH-reduced BphA4 with oxidized BphA3. Therefore, the redox-dependent rotation of the NADH/CT domain seems to be a prerequisite for the binding of BphA3. The larger rotation angle observed in the complex might be the effect of an induced fit upon the complex formation. The second conformational change is a side-chain rotation of His66A3. The 2 angle of this residue rotates by approximately 30°. Since the conformation of His66A3 in the complex was different from those in free BphA3 in the oxidized and reduced forms, this conformational change is likely to be induced by the interaction with Trp320A4. This side-chain rotation of His66A3 induces a weak ­ interaction between His66A3 and Trp320A4 (see above). The third is the conformational change of the peptide bond between Gly46A3 and Glu47A3 of BphA3 (Figure 7(c)). Since BphA3 was in the oxidized form before mixing with reduced BphA4 in the crystallization,15 BphA3 should be reduced by BphA4 during the crystallization process.

Discussion
Structural comparison between the BphA3­BphA4 and the adrenodoxin (Adx)­adorenodoxin reductase (AdR) complexes BphA4 and AdR are structurally relevant proteins, although AdR lacks the C-terminal domain.8 A structural comparison between the Adx­AdR5 and BphA3­BphA4 complexes should give us insight into the electron transfer mechanisms of this family of redox proteins. The superposition of the structure of the two complexes using C atoms in the FADbinding domains of BphA4 and AdR (69 C atoms, rmsd = 1.5 Å) revealed that the binding site of AdR for Adx and that of BphA4 for BphA3 are in nearly the same position with respect to the superposed FAD-binding domains (Figure 9(a)). There are, however, some differences between the two complexes. First, the interacting surface area of the Adx­AdR complex, 1151 Å2, is approximately 1.5 times larger than that of the BphA3­BphA4 complex. In addition, there are 16 hydrogen bonds between Adx and AdR. The interaction between Adx and AdR seems to be stronger than that of the BphA3 and BphA4. Second, the functional implication of the domain rotation seems to be different between the AdR and BphA4. Upon Adx binding, the NADP domain of AdR rotates approximately 3.7° toward the bound Adx5, whereas no significant domain rotation was observed in the NADPH-reduced AdR itself.27 This rotation of the NADP domain of AdR therefore seems to be induced by the Adx binding and to increase the interactions between Adx and AdR. On the other hand, domain rotation was observed in the NADH-reduced BphA4 (Figure 3(d)), and the rotation seemed to be required to form the complex with BphA3 (see below). As suggested above, the net domain rotation observed in the BphA3­BphA4 complex, which is significantly larger than that observed in the NADH-reduced BphA4, might be the sum of the effect of the reduction of BphA4 by NADH and an induced fit upon BphA3 binding. Third, the structure between FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the Adx­AdR complex is different from that in the BphA3­BphA4 complex. In the Adx­AdR complex, there are no intersecting residues between FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster (Figure 9(b)); it has been proposed that tunneling is important for the electron transfer.5 On the other hand, there are two aromatic residues, namely Trp320A4 and His66A3, on the possible electron transfer path of the BphA3BphA4 complex (Figures 8(c) and 9(c)), suggesting that these two residues have significant roles in the electron transfer from FAD to the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Since Trp320A4 is completely conserved in the bacterial homologues of BphA4 such as putidaredoxin reductase and rubredoxin reductase, these bacterial homologues of BphA4 would have similar binding modes for the redox partner and the electron transfer path as those observed in the BphA3­BphA4 complex. It is intriguing to note that

the corresponding Trp residue is conserved in the apoptosis-inducing factors, suggesting the bacterial origin of this mitochondrial protein.28 The comparison between the two complexes revealed that these two proteins seem to adopt different mechanisms to interact with their redox partners, and have different mechanisms of electron transfer, although BphA4 and AdR are related in their primary and tertiary structures. It is of note that AdR does not have a residue corresponding to the Trp320 of BphA4. BphA4 and AdR therefore seem to have evolved divergently from a common ancestor, and to have acquired different characteristics in evolution. Therefore, AdR and BphA4 should be categorized into different subfamilies. The mechanism of the affinity regulation of BphA4 As we demonstrate here, the interaction between BphA3 and BphA4 depends on the redox state of each protein. Through comprehensive structural analysis of BphA3 and BphA4, we have revealed the molecular mechanisms of the redox-dependent interaction between them. The BphA3-binding site of BphA4 is composed of FAD-binding and C-terminal domains. The reduction of BphA4 induces the rotation of the NADH/ CT domain (Figures 3(d) and 4(c)), which causes a conformational change of the BphA3-binding site through the reorientation of the C-terminal domain with respect to the FAD-binding domain. This conformational change seems to be necessary to form the high-affinity BphA3-binding site. Superposition between BphA4(ox, -) and BphA4 in the BphA3­BphA4 complex using C atoms of the FADbinding domain revealed that the rotation of the NADH/CT domain shifts Ala371A4 by 1 Å, thereby avoiding its close contact with Trp48A3 and Ser64A3 of BphA3 (Figure 10(a)). Without the NADH/CT domain rotation, Ala371A4 would make close contact with Trp48A3 and Ser64A3, which would inhibit the high-affinity binding between oxidized BphA3 and oxidized BphA4. Ala371A4 is located at the N-terminal end of helix 8 (residues 371­382) of BphA4, and showed a relatively large positional shift upon FAD reduction: in the hydroquinone and semiquinone forms of BphA4, Ala371A4 shifts by approximately 0.6 Å and 0.8 Å from its position in the resting state (BphA4(ox, -)), respectively (Figure 10(a)). The shifts observed in BphA4(rd, NAD+ ) and BphA4(sq, NAD+) are sufficient to avoid the close contact between Ala371A4 and the BphA3 residues. Thus, the rotation of the NADH/CT domain seems to be essential to form the high-affinity BphA3binding site. The dissociation of BphA3 from BphA4 seems to be explained by the conformational change of BphA3. We prepared a structural model of the BphA4(rd/ sq, NAD+)­BphA3(ox) complex using the crystal structures of the BphA3­BphA4 complex and BphA3 (ox), replacing the BphA3 in the complex with BphA3(ox) using least-squares fitting with all C atoms of BphA3. The model, which represents the

(c) A proposed cyclic reaction model of conformational changes occurring in the BphA4 catalytic cycle. The subunits of the BphA4s are colored in the same way as for Figure 3(d). The bound NAD+ is shown as an orange rectangle. BphA3 in the oxidized and reduced form is shown as a pink ellipsoid and square, respectively. The redox state of BphA4 is shown in parentheses. Of the eight states, the crystal structures of the four states shown with redox signs in red were determined here. The changes in terms of electron transfer are shown by red arrows.

BphA3­BphA4 complex before intermolecular electron transfer, suggested that Glu47A3 has an electrostatic interaction with Arg327A4 in the BphA4(rd/ sq)­BphA3(ox) complex (Figure 10(b)). Upon BphA3 reduction, the redox-dependent flip of the peptide bond between Gly46A3 and Glu47A3 induces a backward shift of Glu47A3, resulting in the breakage of the interaction as observed in the crystal structure of the BphA3­BphA4 complex (Figure 10(b)). This reduction-induced flip seems to facilitate the dissociation of reduced BphA3 from BphA4 by weakening the electrostatic interaction between them.

Mechanism of the cyclic reaction of BphA4 On the basis of the steady-state kinetic study, we proposed a reaction model with eight possible intermediate states (Figure 10(c)). Of these eight states, the crystal structures of four states were determined (Figure 10(c)). The crystal structure of the BphA3­BphA4 complex seems to resemble the BphA3(rd)­BphA4(sq/ox) complex appearing in the reaction cycle. For the remaining two states, theoretical models can be prepared on the basis of the present crystal structures (see Figure 10(b)).

396 Figure 10(c) shows schematically the possible conformational changes of BphA3 and BphA4 in the electron transfer reaction cycle. The series of conformational changes (mostly observed and some modeled) revealed the critical features of the electron transfer reaction. This cyclic reaction can be divided into three elementary reactions, each of which begins with an electron transfer (Figure 10(c)). The first electron transfer is triggered by NADH binding and results in the rotation of the NADH/CT domain (Figures 3(d) and 4(c)), which seems to facilitate the BphA3 association (Figure 10(a)). This interaction induces a weak ­ interaction between Trp320 A4 and His66A3. Since the two residues are located between FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster, the two aromatic sidechains seem to be involved in the electron transfer of an electron from FAD to the Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster. As a result, the second electron transfer reaction occurs, which, in turn, induces the flip of the peptide bond between Gly46A3 and Glu47A3 due to the reduction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of BphA3, being released from the BphA4. The resultant BphA4 is in the semiquinone form with a high-affinity binding site for BphA3. Another BphA3 molecule is thus recruited to the semiquinoid form BphA4, resulting in the third electron transfer. The third electron transfer induces the release of the second BphA3 molecule, and BphA4 returns to the oxidized form. Although the three elementary reactions differ from one another, they share a common feature. Each elementary reaction begins with an electron transfer, inducing a series of redox-dependent conformational changes, and the resultant conformation (or state), in turn, induces the next electron transfer reaction. This causation is a critical characteristic for sequential electron transfer reactions, and because of it, the three elementary reactions comprise a cyclic reaction, in which the direction of the reaction is determined. This mechanism seems to contribute to the efficient electron transfer from NADH to BphA3. We have shown here that the chemical reaction is intimately coupled with conformational changes of FNR and Fdx to regulate the interaction between FNR and Fdx. The present analysis of the redox cyclic reaction should shed new light on the regulatory mechanisms, not only of electron transfer reaction but also of sequential transient protein­protein interactions widely found in biological signaling.

The reduction rate of ferricyanide (NADH + 2 [Fe(CN)6]3-  NAD+ + H+ + 2 [Fe(CN)6]4-) was measured at 420 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.02 × 103 M-1cm-1. In the main text and Figures, kNADH was used cat app for kcat (Figure 1(b)). Rapid reaction was analyzed with a Photal RA-401 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Otsuka Electronics) equipped with a Lauda RMS thermostatically regulated circulating water bath in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 2% (w/v) glycerol at 298 K. The app reduction rate constant of FAD (k2e ) was determined by single exponential curve fitting of the data, which were measured after mixing equal volumes of the 20 M enzyme solution and the 1 mM NADH solution. In these experiments, a two-electron reduction rate was determined. The app rate constant (kred ) was defined as 2 × kapp in order to 2e compare it with kapp, which was determined by measuring cat the one-electron reduction rate. The rapid-scan spectra during and after turnover were measured by mixing equal volumes of the 20 M enzyme solution containing 3 mM ferricyanide and the 1 mM NADH solution. Under this experimental condition, a turnover phase and a subsequent oxidation phase after consumption of NADH were observed. Measurement of the binding affinity between BphA3 and BphA4 The interaction between BphA4 and BphA3 was investigated at 298 K in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) using frontal gel chromatography (FGC)12,13 with a TSKgel SuperSW2000 column (1 mm × 150 mm, bed volume = 120 l; Tosoh). The elution volumes of this column for BphA4 and BphA3 were about 90 l and 105 l, respectively. Owing to this 15 l difference we could measure two plateau regions of the elution of BphA3 when a 100 l­130 l aliquot of BphA3­BphA4 mixture was applied to the column (Figure 2(c)). The BphA3 concentration of the second plateau was equal to that of free BphA3 concentration of the mixture. In the case of the aerobic experiments, a sample loop (0.5 mm × 800 mm PEEK tube, about 160 l) was first overloaded with a BphA4­BphA3 mixture (200 l), which contained 35 M­100 M BphA4 and 10 M­210 M BphA3; then a 100 l­130 l aliquot of the mixture was injected into the column. The flow rate was 10 l/min. The elution of the two proteins was monitored using a photodiode array detector equipped with a 10 l flow cell (SPD-M10AVP; Shimadzu) after postcolumn dilution (tenfold) with the same buffer. The elution profiles of BphA3 were obtained using the absorbance at 580 nm, where BphA4 showed no significant absorption. In the case of anaerobic experiments, dioxygen in the elution buffer was removed using catechol and catechol 2,3dioxygenase,13 and the ring-open products were removed with a small SuperQ-TOYOPEARL column (4.6 mm × 50 mm; Tosoh). A BphA3­BphA4 mixture (400 l) was first argon-saturated in a sealed 3.0 ml vial, and then reduced with 100 nmol of sodium dithionite for about 10 min at room temperature. An approximately 350 l aliquot of the reduced mixture was overloaded into the sample loop using a 1.0 ml gas-tight syringe. The sample loop and the syringe were flushed with argon-saturated dithionite solution just before use. The molar ratio of bound BphA3 per BphA4 subunit (r) was calculated using the following equation (1): r ¼ ð½BphA3total À ½BphA3free Þ=½BphA4total ð1Þ

Materials and Methods
Enzyme kinetics Steady-state enzymatic activities were measured in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 2% (w/v) glycerol at 298K. The apparent Km value for NADH (KNADH) was evaluated by direct curve fitting of m the data according to the Michaelis­Menten equation. The NADH kcat value was determined from the experiments to evaluate the KNADH value. For the measurement of the m KNADH value, 1.5 mM ferricyanide was used as an electron m

and BphA4(sq, NAD+) crystals were prepared by soaking a BphA4(ox, -) crystal in artificial mother liquor (2.5 M sodium formate and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.4)) containing 10 mM NADH for 2 h under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively. Crystals of BphA4(sq, NAD+) were obtained under aerobic conditions, because the oxidation of the semiquinone form is the rate-limiting step of the reaction (Figure 1(b)). In addition, biochemical analysis at pH 5.3 suggested that the semiquinone form was stabilized at pH 5.3 rather than at pH 7.0 (data not shown), which would contribute to the accumulation of the semiquinone form in the crystal. The BphA4(ox, NAD+) crystal was prepared by soaking a BphA4(ox, -) crystal in artificial mother liquor containing 10 mM NAD+ for 64 h under aerobic conditions. The redox states of the FAD molecules in the crystals were identified by micro-spectroscopy (Figure 3(a)) as well as by visual inspection. BphA3(ox) and BphA3(rd) were crystallized as reported.11,14 Diffraction data were collected at BL6A, BL18B, and NW12A of PF at KEK (Tsukuba) with Quantum CCD detectors. Data processing was performed using the XDS30 or HKL200031 program. Crystal structures were determined by the difference Fourier method using the previously determined BphA4 structure.8 Crystallographic refinements were carried out using REFMAC532 from the CCP4 program suite.33 Simulated annealing calculations for the omit maps were calculated using CNS.34 Crystal structure determination of the BphA3­BphA4 complex Wild-type BphA3 and BphA4 proteins were purified as described.29,35 The BphA3­BphA4 complex was crystallized under anaerobic conditions.15 Briefly, BphA4(ox, -) (26.4 mg/ml) was reduced using an excess amount of 20 mM NADH in a plastic tube that had been stored under aerobic conditions. The obtained reduced BphA4 (21.1 mg/ml, 137.5 l) was mixed with BphA3(ox) (17.5 mg/ml, 52.8 l) and incubated on ice for 5 min. The protein solution obtained was used for crystallization by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The conditions of the reservoir solution were 0.1 M sodium citrate, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, and 30% (w/v) PEG4000 (pH 6.4). Orange crystals appeared in one to two weeks. The diffraction data were collected at NW12A at the KEK-PF-AR (Tsukuba) with a Quantum CCD detector. Data processing was performed using the program XDS.30 The crystal structure of the BphA3-BphA4 complex was initially determined using the diffraction data collected as space group C2221 with cell parameters a = 65 Å, b = 103 Å, and c = 174 Å. Molecular replacement using the programs MOLREP36 and PHASER37 with BphA48 and BphF38 (PDB code 1FQT) as search models successfully found the solution. The asymmetric unit consisted of one BphA4 and one BphA3. Crystallographic refinement of this structure using the program CNS and REFMAC was performed. However, we could not obtain an R-factor and free R-factor less than 31% and 37%, respectively, at 2.2 Å resolution. We then re-evaluated the diffraction data and found that the cumulative intensity distribution plot, which was calculated by the program TRUNCATE in CCP4, suggested the twinning of the crystal. An L-test39 was then performed for further analysis of the twining using the program DATAMAN in the RAVE package.40 The L-test suggested that the crystal of the BphA3­BphA4 complex is perfectly twinned. Although the diffraction pattern of the crystal

where n is the maximal number of BphA3 binding sites and Kd is the dissociation constant of BphA4 for BphA3. Pull-down assay All procedures except the biotinylation of BphA3 were carried out in an anaerobic chamber.14 BphA3 was biotinylated using an ECL Protein biotinylation kit (GE Healthcare Biosciences) and then immobilized to streptavidin Sepharose High-Performance resin (GE Healthcare Biosciences) by incubation in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.3 M NaCl, for 1 h at 293 K. The resin was treated with ascorbate and ascorbate oxidase to remove oxygen molecules. After equilibration with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.3 M NaCl (buffer A) the BphA3-immobilized resin (50 l) was mixed with 3 l of reduced or oxidized BphA4 (13.7 mg/ml) and incubated for 10 min. The 0.3 M of NaCl was required to maximize the immobilized amount of BphA3. The reduction of BphA4 was performed by 20.6 mM NADH. The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of buffer A containing 10 mM NADH or with buffer A alone, respectively. A 25 l aliquot of buffer A was added to the washed resin, and the final resin (13.5 l) was applied directly to SDS­PAGE. The control experiment was done using the resin that did not bind BphA3. Preparation of mutants Mutant genes of BphA4 (Trp320A4Phe, Trp320A4Ala Lys53A4Met, and Ser52A4Thr) were prepared by sitedirected mutagenesis using PCR. All the mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells and were purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS­PAGE using a method similar to that for the wild-type.29 Partial digestion Partial digestion was performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 293 K. For digestion, a lysyl endopeptidase, Acromobacter Protease I (TaKaRa), was used. The reactions were started by adding 2 pmol of the protease to the BphA4 solution (48 pmol and 96 pmol of BphA4 for lanes 1­3 and 4­13 of Figure 4(b), respectively), and the reaction solution was incubated for 20 h at 293 K. The reactions were stopped by heating with sample buffer for SDS­PAGE. The cleavage sites were determined by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Protein bands were electro-transferred to a PVDF membrane and analyzed by an amino acid sequencer. Crystal structure analysis of free BphA3 and BphA4 The crystallization of BphA4 was performed by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method with a minor modification to the reported conditions.29 BphA4(rd, NAD+)

suggested the space group C2221 with cell parameters a = 65 Å, b = 103 Å, and c = 174 Å, it was a pseudohemihedrally twinned crystal of the space group P21 with a twin rule of (l, -k, h). The crystal structure of the BphA3­BphA4 complex with space group P21 was determined with the program MOLREP36 using as a search model the BphA4 dimer, which was generated using the partially refined crystal structure of the BphA3­BphA4 complex with space group C2221. One BphA4 dimer was found in the asymmetric unit. After one cycle of refinement using the program SHELX41 with the twin fraction of 0.5, the sigma-weighted electron density map showed weak electron densities for BphA3 next to one of the two BphA4 subunits. No significant electron densities of BphA3 were found next to the other BphA4 subunit. One BphA3 molecule was therefore added to the model. One round of crystallographic refinement consisted of least-squares crystallographic refinement using program SHELX41 and model re-building with a sigma-A-weighted electron density map using program XtalView.42 Test-set reflections for the free R-factor calculation were selected considering the twin rule; the related twinned reflection pairs are in the test set. After several rounds of crystallographic refinement, we noticed that there were very weak electron densities in the BphA3 binding site of the left subunit of BphA4 shown in Figure 7(a). It was possible to place a BphA3 molecule at the second binding site. However, the addition of the second BphA3 molecule did not improve the R-factor and free R-factor, and the second BphA3 molecule showed very high temperature factors compared with other portions of the molecule. Thus, we did not add a second BphA3 molecule to the model. The asymmetric unit of the final model contains one BphA4 dimer, one BphA3 molecule, two FAD molecules, and two NAD+ molecules without nicotinamide rings. The existence of the BphA3, FAD, and NAD+ molecules were confirmed by Fo­ Fc SA-omit maps. The twin fraction was refined using the program SHELX, resulting in the twin fraction of 0.497. An R-factor and free R-factor of 0.179 and 0.262 were obtained (Table 1). The bending of the isoalloxazine ring in the BphA3­ BphA4 complex was examined as follows. First, we prepared a restraint file for FAD, which allowed the bending of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The FAD molecules in the complex structure were then replaced with the FAD molecule of BphA4(rd, NAD+), which adopted a bent conformation (Figure 3(b)). The BphA3­ BphA4 complex structure with reduced-form FAD molecules was refined using the program SHELX with the prepared restraint file. BphA4(rd, NAD+) was also refined using SHELX with the same restraint file as a reference. Although the isoalloxazine ring in the BphA4(rd, NAD+) retained the bend, the isoalloxazine rings of FADs in the BphA3­Bph4 complex recovered their flat conformation afterwards. Structure analysis The surface area of a molecules were calculated by the program SURFACE in the CCP4 program suite.33 The interacting surface area between molecule A and B in an A­B complex was calculated by [(the surface area of molecule A) + (the surface area of molecule B)­(the surface area of the complex A-B)]/2. The hydrogen bonds were calculated using the program CONTACT in the CCP4 program suite.33 The packing efficiency26 was calculated by the packing efficiency calculator using the radical plane
