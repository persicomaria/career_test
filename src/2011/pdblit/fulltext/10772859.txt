Abstract During RuvAB-mediated Holliday-junction migration two opposite arms of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are driven to translocate unidirectional by two respective ring-like hexameric RuvB proteins. However, how the RuvB protein, powered by ATP hydrolysis, drives unidirectional translocation of dsDNA is not clear. Here a model is presented for this mechanochemical-coupling mechanism. In the model, the unidirectional translocation is resulted from both the ATP hydrolysis-induced rotation (power stroke) of the RuvB subsunit and the passage of the strong DNA binding from the previous to next RuvB subunits during the sequential ATPase activities around the ring. Using the model, the relationship between the power-stroke size, the step size of DNA translocation and the ratio of the rotational rate of DNA over that of RuvB relative to RuvA is predicted. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction The Escherichia coli RuvA and RuvB proteins are involved in the late stages of recombination and the recombinational repair of damaged DNA (Lodish et al., 2000; West, 1996, 1998). The RuvA protein forms symmetric tetramers and binds to the center of a Holliday junction, unfolding the junction into a square planar configuration and keeping the four single-stranded segments at the center apart (Hargreaves et al., 1998; Ariyoshi et al., 2000). This induces binding of two ring-like hexameric RuvB proteins, which surround the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) exiting from opposite sides of the RuvA complex (see Fig. 1) (Tsaneva et al., 1992a; Iwasaki et al., 1992; Yu et al., 1997; Yamada et al., 2002). Powered by ATP hydrolysis, the RuvB hexamers act as molecular motors, pumping the two dsDNAs out of the RuvA-junction assembly, which induces the movement of the Holliday junction, a process known as branch migration (Tsaneva et al., 1992a; Iwasaki et al., 1992;

Yu et al., 1997; Yamada et al., 2002; Muller et al., 1993b; Hiom and West, 1995). Recently, the advent of techniques to micro-manipulate single molecules has enabled studies of the dynamical properties of single-motor enzymes such as kinesin (Block et al., 1990), myosin-V (Mehta et al., 1999), DNA polymerase (Wuite et al., 2000; Maier et al., 2000) and RNA polymerase (Abbondanzieri et al., 2005), etc. By using these techniques, the RuvAB-mediated Holliday junction branch migration has also been elaborately visualized (Amit et al., 2004; Dawid et al., 2004; Dennis et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006). The branch migration rates have been measured by monitoring the movement of the tethered beads attached to one arm of DNA (Amit et al., 2004; Dawid et al., 2004). Also, the rotation of DNA accompanying the branch migration has been observed and the rotational rate been determined by monitoring the rotation of the tethered bead (Han et al., 2006). All these dynamical properties provide further important information on our understanding of the mechanochmical-coupling mechanism of RuvAB-mediated branch migration. In this work, based on the previous structural, biochemical and dynamical studies a model is presented on how ATP hydrolysis in RuvB hexamer drives unidirectional

translocation of DNA during RuvAB-catalyzed branch migration of Holliday junctions. In this model, the step size of DNA translocation is the result of two substep sizes, with one being the size of ATP hydrolysis-induced power stroke and the other one being the size induced by the passage of the strong DNA binding from the previous to next RuvB subunits. Moreover, due to the structural restriction of the RuvAB­Holliday junction complex, the ATPase-dependent rotation of RuvB relative to RuvA is also involved in the model. Using the model, the relationship between the power-stroke size, the step size of DNA translocation and the ratio of the rotational rate of DNA over that of RuvB relative to RuvA is predicted.

(a) Side view of dsDNA, with Subunit1*.ATP and Subunit10 *.ATP complexes binding strongly to residues 0 on the two sugar and phosphate backbones of dsDNA, where for clarity only RuvB subunit 1/subunit 10 with their DNA-binding sites (gray dots) are drawn. (b) After simultaneous hydrolyses of ATP in subunit 1/subunit 10 , the rotation of the DNA-binding sites (gray dots) of the two subunits drives DNA moved a distance L along the axis of the RuvB hexamer. The DNA-binding sites of subunit 2 (red dots) and that of subunit 3 (cyan dot) are drawn. (c) The planform of (a), where only DNA-binding sites of subunit 1/subunit 10 (gray dots) and subunit 2/subunit 20 (red dots) are drawn. (d) The planform of (b), where all the six subunits (gray, red and cyan rectangles) with their DNA-binding sites (gray, red and cyan dots) as well as RuvA tetramer (yellow rectangle) are drawn. After Pi releases, the subunit 1/ subunit 10 become very weakly bound to DNA and Subunit2*.ATP/ Subunit20 *.ATP complexes will most probable bind residues n that are nearest to the DNA-binding sites of the two subunits. This causes DNA moved downwards by a distance d and simultaneously makes DNA rotated relative to RuvB clockwise by an angle of W ¼ ny0 À f. Since the subunit 1 in ADP state has a weak interaction with RuvA, the strong interaction between Subunit2*.ATP.DNA complex and RuvA drives subunit 2 rotated towards RuvA, which gives the RuvB hexamer and DNA rotating clockwise relative to RuvA by f ¼ 601. Therefore, the DNA is totally moved downwards by D ¼ L+d for one step and rotated by angle Y ¼ W þ f ¼ ny0 by hydrolyses of two ATP molecules.

2. Model Since branch migration is performed by translocations of two arms of dsDNA in opposite directions driven by RuvAB complex with two respective RuvB hexamers that also lie in opposite orientations, as shown in Fig. 1, in order to study their mechanochemical-coupling mechanism we need only to consider the translocation of one arm of dsDNA driven by one RuvB hexamer. For convenience, we take coordinate oxyz as shown in Fig. 2. Before the presentation of the unidirectional dsDNAtranslocation mechanism by RuvB hexamer in conjunction with RuvA tetramer, we first present some preliminary hypotheses and the supporting experimental evidences to the hypotheses in the following Sections 2.1­2.4.

2.1. Nucleotide-state-dependent binding affinity for dsDNA Previous observations reported by Muller et al. (1993a) showed that RuvB binds strongly dsDNA in the presence of ATP or a nonhydrolyzable ATPanalog ATPgS, while no interaction between RuvB and dsDNA in the presence of ADP or in the absence of nucleotide was detected. Other ring-shaped hexameric motor proteins also show similar nucleotide-dependent binding affinity to the RuvB hexamer. For example, it has been shown that the hexameric T7 gp4 helicase has a high affinity for ssDNA in the presence of dTTP, a low affinity in the presence of dTDP and a very low affinity in the absence of nucleotides (Hingorani and Patel, 1993). The experiments on bacteriophage f29 DNA packaging motor indicated also that the affinity for

dsDNA is high in ATP state while is low in ADP or nucleotide-free state (Chemla et al., 2005). Based on these evidences, we make the following minimal hypothesis for a RuvB subunit: (1) a weak dsDNA-binding ATP state (unactivated Subunit.ATP complex), (2) a strong dsDNAbinding ATP state (activated Subunit*.ATP complex), (3) a strong dsDNA-binding ADP.Pi state (Subunit.ADP.Pi complex), (4) a weak dsDNA-binding ADP state, and (5) a weak dsDNA-binding nucleotide-free state. As proposed for T7 helicase (Liao et al., 2005) it is also assumed here that there exists a weak dsDNA-binding ATP state besides the strong dsDNA-binding ATP state. In the strong dsDNA-binding ATP and ADP.Pi states, it is assumed that the nucleotide-bound subunit binds strongly to the sugar and phosphate residues of dsDNA. For simplicity of analysis, here we consider that the subunit at one time interacts with the sugar and phosphate residues that connect one base pair. For convenience of writing, in this work the sugar and phosphate residues that connect base pair n (n is an integer number) are denoted by residues n (see Fig. 2(a)). In addition, the analysis of RuvB in solution by gel filtration showed that it is a dimer (Tsaneva et al., 1992b), which is in contrast to the F1-ATPase (Boyer, 1993; Abrahams et al., 1994) and the hexameric T7 helicase (Hingorani et al., 1997; Jeong et al., 2002; Xie, 2007). The two-fold symmetry of the nucleotide-binding sites in RuvB hexamer is also consistent with its pre-steady-state kinetics, showing that it hydrolyzes two ATP molecules per hexamer (Marrione and Cox, 1995; Marrione and Cox, 1996). Thus, as suggested before (Putnam et al., 2001), it is assumed that the ATPase activities of two facing subunits in the hexamer work synergetically. The two facing subunits will then simultaneously bind to or detach from the sugar and phosphate residues on the two backbones that connect one base pair, as shown in Fig. 2(a).

the RuvB hexamer and the stronger interaction between RuvB and RuvA. 2.3. Sequential ATPase activities around the ring Similar to other ring-shaped motor proteins such as hexameric T7 helicases that show sequential dTTPase activity around the ring in the presence of ssDNA (Liao et al., 2005; Crampton et al., 2006), it is reasonable to assume that the ATPase activity around the RuvB ring is also sequential in the presence of dsDNA, which is detailed as follows: The strong binding of dsDNA to Subunit*.ATP complexes [e.g., subunits 1 and 10 in Fig. 2(a) or (d)] significantly stimulates (1) the ATP hydrolyses in the catalytic sites of the subunits [e.g., subunits 1 and 10 in Fig. 2(a) or (d)] and the releases of the hydrolysis products, and (2) the transitions of Subunit.ATP to activated Subunit*.ATP in the adjacent subunits in the counterclockwise direction [e.g. subunits 2 and 20 in Fig. 2(d)]. These assumptions are consistent with the biochemical experiments showing that the DNA increases ATPase rate of RuvB (Marrione and Cox, 1995; Marrione and Cox, 1996). The stimulation of the ATPase activity from the previous adjacent subunit can be inferred from the crystal structure (Putnam et al., 2001; Hishida et al., 2004) showing that the conformational changes in subunits 1 and 10 reposition Arg-174 close to the nucleotide phosphates in the adjacent ATP-bound subunits 2 and 20 and stimulate their ATPase activities (Hishida et al., 2004). 2.4. Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.Pi induces the power stroke The crystal structure of the active bacteriophage T7 helicase hexamer with different nucleotides in different subunits revealed that NTP hydrolysis triggers a 151 rotation of that subunit in the plane of the ring, putatively causing ssDNA to be pulled through the ring by a lever arm (Singleton et al., 2000). The rotation displaces the ° ssDNA-binding loop by 6­7 A along the axis of the hexamer (Singleton et al., 2000). The recent determined snapshots of crystal structure of bacteriophage f12 P4 RNA packaging hexamer in different nucleotide states (Mancini et al., 2004) also revealed that the putative RNAbinding residue is displaced along the channel by about ° 12 A following the hydrolysis of bound ATP. For the RuvB hexamer (Yamada et al., 2002; Putnam et al., 2001), no similar snapshots of the crystal structure have been available. Here we assume that the ATP hydrolysis in a RuvB subunit can also cause the dsDNA-binding residue movement by a distance L, where L ¼ 0 implies no rotation of the subunit. Since the ATP hydrolysis is stimulated strongly by the strong binding of Subunit*.dTTP to DNA (see Section 2.3), the power stroke takes place most probably when DNA is bound strongly to the subunit, thus ensuring rarely occurring of futile mechanochemical couplings.

2.2. Nucleotide-state-dependent interaction between RuvB subunit and RuvA Similar to the nucleotide-dependent binding affinity of RuvB subunit for dsDNA as assumed in Section 2.1, we make the following hypothesis for the interaction between RuvB subunit and RuvA: The RuvB subunit in ATP or in ADP.Pi state has a stronger interaction with RuvA than the RuvB subunit in ADP or nucleotide-free state. This hypothesis is consistent with the experiment by Parsons and West (1993) showing that the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPgS improves the stability of the RuvAB­Holliday junction complex and the further observation by Hiom and West (1995) demonstrating that the RuvAB­Holliday junction complex in the presence of ATPgS sedimented faster than those in the absence of ATPgS. The improved stability and the faster sediment of RuvAB­Holliday junction complex in the presence of ATPgS may be due to the improved binding of RuvB to DNA, the stability of

Therefore, the kinetic pathway in each subunit can be written as follows: E À T À DNA:TÃ ! ! À D À E, ! ! where E, T, DNA.T*, DNA.DP, and D represent Subunit.Empty (weak DNA binding), Subunit.ATP (weak DNA binding), Subunit*.DNA.ATP (strong DNA binding), Subunit.DNA.ADP.Pi (strong DNA binding), and Subunit.ADP (weak DNA binding) complexes, respectively. The transition k2 T À TÃ can be stimulated significantly by the previous ! subunit in Subunit*.DNA.ATP state and the transition k3 DNA.T*À DNA.DP, which results in a translocation of ! dsDNA due to the power stroke, can be stimulated significantly by the binding of DNA to the subunit in the activated Subunit*.dTTP state. The binding of DNA to the activated Subunit*.ATP complex may induce another translocation of dsDNA (see the following Section 2.5). 2.5. Unidirectional dsDNA-translocation mechanisms by RuvAB Based on the assumptions and statements described in above Sections 2.1­2.4, we describe the unidirectional dsDNA translocation by RuvAB as follows. We begin with the bound ATP in subunit 1/subunit 10 transited to activated Subunit1*.ATP/Subunit10 *.ATP states. The strong binding forces of the binary complexes to DNA (see Section 2.1) make them bind to their nearest DNA residues 0, as shown in Fig. 2(a). At the same time, the strong interaction between Subunit1*.ATP and RuvA (see Section 2.2) make them bind together strongly. Then the ternary complexes Subunit1*.DNA.ATP/Subunit10 *.DNA.ATP stimulate the transition of the bound ATP in their next adjacent subunit 2/subunit 20 from Subunit2.ATP/Subunit20 .ATP to Subunit2*.ATP/Subunit20 *.ATP complexes (see Section 2.3). Simultaneously, the ternary complexes Subunit1*.DNA.ATP/Subunit10 *.DNA.ATP also stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP molecules bound to the subunit 1/subunit 10 (see Section 2.3). The rotations of the DNA-binding sites of subunit 1/ subunit 10 induced by the ATP hydrolyses (i.e., DNA.T*DNA.DP) drive DNA moved downwards by a distance L along the axis of the hexamer (see Section 2.4), as shown in Fig. 2(b), because, due to the spatial restriction of RuvA, the subunit 1/subunit 10 are not allowed to move upwards. After Pi releases the subunit 1/subunit 10 become very weakly bound to DNA. Now due to the strong binding forces of Subunit2*.ATP/Subunit20 *.ATP [the DNA-binding sites of which are shown by red dots in Fig. 2(c) or (d)] to DNA, the residues n (n is an integer), which are nearest to the DNA-binding sites of subunit 2/subunit 20 , are most probable to bind to them. The binding forces drives DNA moved downwards by another distance, d, where d is the distance along the z-axis between the DNA-binding site

[the red dot in Fig. 2(b)] of subunit 2 and its nearest DNA residues n. Simultaneously, DNA rotates relative to RuvB clockwise (viewed downwards) by an angle of W ¼ ny0 À f [as can be seen from Fig. 2(c) or (d)], where y0 ¼ 3601/10.5 is the angle between two successive base pairs of B-form DNA with 10.5 bp/turn and f ¼ 601 is the angle between two adjacent subunits of RuvB. Moreover, after Pi release from subunit 1, the stronger interaction of Subunit2*.ATP.DNA complex with RuvA than that of subunit 1 in ADP state with RuvA (see Section 2.2) makes subunit 2 rotate towards RuvA and then they bind together strongly. This gives the RuvB hexamer together with dsDNA rotating clockwise relative to RuvA by f ¼ 601 [as seen from Fig. 2(d)]. Therefore, DNA is totally moved downwards by a distance D ¼ L+d and rotated clockwise by an angle Y ¼ W þ f ¼ ny0 relative to RuvA for one step by hydrolysis of two ATP molecules. Then the ternary complexes Subunit2*.DNA.ATP/Subunit20 *.DNA.ATP stimulate the transition of the bound ATP in the next subunit 3/subunit 30 from Subunit3.ATP/ Subunit30 .ATP to Subunit3*.ATP/Subunit30 *.ATP and also stimulate the ATP hydrolyses bound to subunit 2/ subunit 20 . Then as discussed above the next mechanical step, i.e., the clockwise rotation of RuvB relative to RuvA by an angle f ¼ 601, the downward translocation of DNA by a distance D ¼ L+d and the clockwise rotation of DNA relative to RuvA by an angle Y ¼ W þ f ¼ ny0 , will proceed. Note that, since the two facing subunits in activated ATP state are binding strongly to DNA, the rotations of the DNA-binding site in other subunits induced by the release of product ADP and/or ATP binding have no effect on DNA translocation because in ADP and nucleotide-free states the subunits have weak binding affinities for DNA. Thus, the returned rotations of DNA-binding site from post-power-stroke position to prepower-stroke position have not been discussed here. In this mechanism the translocation of DNA per hydrolysis of two ATP molecules consists of three steps: one step is induced by the power stroke following the hydrolysis of ATP, another one is resulted from the strong binding of the Subunit*.ATP complexes to DNA and the third one involves the rotation of RuvB.DNA complex relative to RuvA. The first step involves only the translocation of DNA with no rotation of DNA relative to RuvA; the second step involves both the translocation of DNA and the rotation of DNA relative to RuvA; and the third step involves only the rotation of DNA relative to RuvA with no translocation of DNA. Moreover, nearly at any moment, two of the six subunits bind strongly to DNA, thus ensuring the high processivity for the branch migration of Holliday junction, which is consistent with the experimental results (Amit et al., 2004; Dawid et al., 2004). In the above we have only discussed the translocation of one arm of dsDNA driven by one RuvB hexamer. The translocations of two opposite arms of dsDNA driven, respectively, by two RuvB hexamers are discussed as follows. Similar to the assumption that the strong

interaction between DNA and RuvB subunits mediates the ATPase activity of the RuvB subunits (see Section 2.3), it is reasonable to assume that the strong interaction between RuvA and RuvB subunits in ATP states in two hexamers (see Section 2.2) also mediates the ATP hydrolyses in the catalytic sites of the two RuvB subunits. This may thus result in nearly coordinated ATP hydrolyses between the two RuvB hexamer in the RuvAB­Holliday junction complex. Therefore, the translocations of two opposite arms of dsDNA driven, respectively, by two RuvB hexamers may show nearly coordinated. 3. Dependence of mean DNA translocation step size on power-stroke size by RuvB In this section, based on the model presented in above section we will give calculations of the DNA translocation size per hydrolysis of two ATP molecules versus the powerstroke size in RuvAB-mediated branch migration. As seen in Section 2.5, the DNA translocation size per hydrolysis of two ATP molecules is D ¼ L+d, where L is the power-stroke size and d is the DNA translocation size resulted from the passage of the strong DNA binding from the previous two subunits that face each other to the next adjacent two facing subunits. Now we calculate d. Based on Debye­Huckel theory, the electrostatic potential V(n) between the positively charged DNA-binding site (or loops) of the RuvB subunit 2 and the negatively charged residues n of DNA can be approximately written as follows (Levin, 2002): V ðnÞ ¼ ÀC 1 e
ÀkrðnÞ

Since the probability for the residues n to bind one subunit is inversely proportional to the time, T, taken for the residues n to arrive at the DNA-binding site of the subunit, we then need to determine the time T. To this end, consider the following equation for the movement of DNA relative to the RuvB subunit 2 in Fig. 2 dr ¼ F þ f ðtÞ, (2) dt where the distance r between the DNA-binding site of subunit 2 and the residues n is in the range from r(t ¼ 0)E0 to rðt ¼ TÞ ¼ fð2l 0 sin jðFðnÞ=2ÞjÞ2 þ ½zðnÞ2 g1=2 , G is the drag coefficient, F ¼ ÀqV =qr is the force between the residues n and the DNA-binding site of subunit 2 and f(t) is the Langevin force with hf ðtÞi ¼ 0 and hf ðtÞf ðt0 Þi ¼ 2kB TGdðt À t0 Þ. From Eqs. (1) and (2) we obtain the RD mean time hTi ¼ G=C 1 0 ðr2 =ð1 þ krÞekr Þdr; where D ¼ fð2l 0 sin jFðnÞ=2jÞ2 þ ½zðnÞ2 g1=2 . Thus the probability for the residues n to bind subunit 2 is Z D  2  À1 r kr e dr , PðnÞ ¼ C 0 (3) 1 þ kr 0 G where C0 is a constant independent of the distance between the DNA-binding site of subunit 2 and the DNA residues. In the limit of Debye length xD  kÀ1 b0:34 nm, Eq. (3) is reduced to ( )À3=2   FðnÞ 2 C0 2  PðnÞ ¼ 2l 0 sin . (4)  2  þ ½zðnÞ 3 Eq. (4) is the same as that presented in Xie (2007). Inside cell the Debye length is in the order of 1 nm. Based on the binding probability, the mean translocation size d can be calculated by the equation , 1 1 X X d¼ ½PðnÞ Â ðnp À LÞ PðnÞ. (5)

where C1 is a constant depending on the charge of DNAbinding site and that of residues of DNA. The term eÀkrðnÞ represents the screening effect on the charges of DNAbinding site and the DNA residues by the surrounding ionic cloud, with k  xÀ1 being the inverse of Debye D length. The parameter r(n) is the distance between DNAbinding site of subunit 2 and DNA residues n, which is in the form rðnÞ ¼ fð2l 0 sin jFðnÞ=2jÞ2 þ ½zðnÞ2 g1=2 , where l0 is the radius of dsDNA viewed along the helical axis as shown in Fig. 2(c). Based on the structure of DNA in B form and the base pair number defined in Fig. 2(b), we ° have z(n) ¼ npÀL, where p ¼ 3.4 A is the distance between two successive base pairs. If the radius of the center channel of the RuvB hexamer, lB, is close to l0, we have F(n) ¼ y(n)À601, where y(n) is the angle between base pairs n:n and 0:0. Due to the structural restriction of the RuvAB­Holliday junction complex (see Fig. 1), for example, the lower arm dsDNA can only be allowed to make a clockwise (viewed downwards) rotation of y0 ¼ 3601/10.5 when it translocates downwards by one base pair and thus we should have y(n) ¼ n Â 3601/10.5. In ° the calculation, we take l0 ¼ 3 bp (about 10 A), which is also close to lB.

As mentioned in Section 2.5, the DNA rotation angle relative to RuvA per hydrolysis of two ATP molecules Y ¼ f þ W, where f ¼ 601 and W is the rotation angle resulted from the passage of the strong DNA binding from the previous two facing subunits 1 and 10 to the next adjacent two facing subunits 2 and 20 . W can be calculated by using the following equation: , 1 1 X X W¼ ðPðnÞFðnÞÞ PðnÞ. (6)

Using Eq. (5) we calculate d versus power-stroke size L for three Debye lengths (xDc0.34 nm, xD ¼ 1 nm and xD ¼ 0.7 nm) and then obtain the results of D ¼ L+d as a function of L, as shown in Fig. 3(a). First, it is seen that for Lo9 nm the step size is insensitive to the Debye length and it is a good approximation to use the simplified Eq. (5) instead of Eq. (4). Second, it is interesting to see that even with no power stroke, i.e., L ¼ 0, we still have a DNA translocation step size of about D ¼ 1.2 bp, which is purely

induced by the passage of the DNA binding from the previous subunits 1 and 10 to the next adjacent subunits 2 and 20 . The DNA translocation step size D increases with the increase of the power-stroke size L until L reaches the ° value of about 6 A and then in the range of about ° oLo8.5 A the translocation size D is kept nearly at a ° 6A constant value of 2 bp. Then with L increasing the step size D increases monotonously. The $2 bp translocation step ° ° size occurred at 6 AoLo8.5 A is mainly induced by the power stroke while the passage of DNA makes the small contribution. Moreover, using Eq. (6) we calculate W versus L for three Debye lengths, with the results shown in Fig. 3(b). Then using the results in Fig. 3(a) and (b) the obtained total DNA rotation angle relative to RuvA per base-pair translocation is, as expected, (f+W)/D ¼ 3601/ 10.5, independent of power-stroke size L. In addition, based on the mechanism presented in Section 2.5, the ratio of the rotational rate of DNA over that of RuvB relative to RuvA can be calculated by using the equation r ¼ (f+W)/ f, with the results shown in Fig. 3(c). It is seen that if the translocation step size is about 1.2 bp, which is occurred with no power stroke, the rotational rate of DNA is smaller than that of RuvB, with the ratio of about 0.67. If the translocation step size is about 2 bp, which is occurred with ° ° the power-stroke size in the range of 6 AoLo8.5 A, the rotational rate of DNA is slightly larger than the rotational rate of RuvB, with the ratio of about 1.135. Up to now the results are based on the sequential ATPase activity around the RuvB ring. It is also interesting to see the effect of random ATPase activity on the DNA translocation. To this end, we consider that, after the power strokes of subunit 1/subunit 10 , DNA is transferred from subunit 1/subunit 10 to either subunit 2/subunit 20 , or subunit 3/subunit 30 , or subunit 20 /subunit 2 or subunit 30 /subunit 3. The mean translocation step size of random ATPase activity should be obtained by averaging the above four step sizes, with the result shown in Fig. 4 by solid line. It is seen that the random ATPase activity can still give a unidirectional translocation of DNA if a non-zero power-stroke size exists. Furthermore, if there is no the kinetic property that the ATPase activities of two subunits in the RuvB hexamer work synergetically, then at any time only one subunit binds strongly to dsDNA, giving one mechanical step powered by hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. For this case, the mean translocation step size of random ATPase activity can be obtained by averaging five step sizes. The result is shown in Fig. 4 by broken line, which shows the unidirectional translocation of DNA if there is a non-zero power-stroke size. This is consistent with the experiments showing that RuvB rings composed of both wild-type RuvB and ATPase dead RuvBD113N are capable of mediating branch migration (Mezard et al., 1997). 4. Discussion In this work, a model is presented for the branch migration of Holliday junctions catalyzed by RuvAB

proteins. The mechanism of the unidirectional translocation of dsDNA by RuvB protein used therein is similar to that of the unidirectional translocation of ssDNA by hexameic T7 and DnaB helicase (Xie, 2007). This DNAtranslocation mechanism and the developed equations to calculate the DNA-translocation step size per ATP can also be applicable, by some modifications, to other ringshaped motor proteins such as DNA/RNA packaging motors (Chemla et al., 2005; Mancini et al., 2004; Simpson et al., 2000) and the FtsK DNA translocase (Massey et al., 2006). As an example, consider the hexameric or pentameric prohead­pRNA­ATPase complexes of bacteriophage f29

DNA packaging motors (Chemla et al., 2005; Simpson et al., 2000). Different from the RuvB hexamers, for these motors there is no kinetic property that the ATPase activities of two subunits in the hexamer or pentamer work synergetically. Except this property, all other kinetic properties are assumed the same as those of RuvB hexamer, i.e., (1) the nucleotide-state-dependent binding affinity for dsDNA, (2) DNA binding inducing sequential ATPase activities around the ring and (3) the hydrolysis of ATP inducing the power stroke. This means that, at any time, there is only one subunit binding strongly to DNA and one mechanical step is powered by hydrolysis of one ATP for the packaging motors, which is in contrast to the case for RuvB, where one mechanical step is powered by hydrolysis of two ATP molecules. Thus, to calculate the DNA-translocation step size and the DNA rotation angle relative to the packaging motors per ATP hydrolysis, we can still use the equations developed in Section 3 but with F0 (n) instead of F(n), where F0 (n)is defined as follows: F0 (n) ¼ F(n)+3601 when À4501oF(n)oÀ2701, F0 (n) ¼ F(n)+1801 when À2701oF(n)oÀ901, F0 (n) ¼ F(n) when À901oF(n)o901, F0 (n) ¼ F(n)À1801 when 901oF(n)o2701, F0 (n) ¼ F(n)À3601 when 2701oF(n) o4501, etc. The replacement of F(n) by F0 (n) is because, for this case, (1) either of the two DNA sugar-phosphate backbones can bind to the subunit of the hexamer or pentamer and (2) the DNA can be rotated freely during its translocation by the motor protein. Note also that for the hexamer we have F(n) ¼ y(n)À601, while for the pentamer we have F(n) ¼ y(n)À721. The theoretical results of D ¼ L+d versus L per ATP are shown in Fig. 5 by solid and broken lines for hexmeric and pentameric DNA packaging motors, respectively. As expected, the curves for packaging motors are similar to those shown in Fig. 3(a). The DNA packaging step size of about 2 bp/ ATP that is consistent with the previous experimental results (Chemla et al., 2005; Guo et al., 1987) occurs at the ° ° power-stroke size in the range of about 6 AoLo9 A, which can be tested structurally. In summary, a general model is presented for the translocation of DNA by ring-shaped motor proteins. The branch migration of Holliday junctions mediated by ring-shaped hexameric RuvB in conjunction with tetrameric RuvA is studied. In the future, it is expected to measure the translocation size per hydrolysis of two ATP molecules, to measure the ratio of the rotational rate of DNA over that of RuvB relative to RuvA, and to structurally determine the power stroke size following the hydrolysis of ATP, in order to compare with the theoretical results given in Fig. 3(a) and (c).
