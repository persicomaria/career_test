Crystal Structure of RecA from Deinococcus radiodurans: Insights into the Structural Basis of Extreme Radioresistance

Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health 371 Hamilton Hall, 1645 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210 USA The resistance of Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr) to extreme doses of ionizing radiation depends on its highly efficient capacity to repair dsDNA breaks. Dr RecA, the key protein in the repair of dsDNA breaks by homologous recombination, promotes DNA strand-exchange by an unprecedented inverse pathway, in which the presynaptic filament is formed on dsDNA instead of ssDNA. In order to gain insight into the remarkable repair capacity of Dr and the novel mechanistic features of its RecA protein, we ° have determined its X-ray crystal structure in complex with ATPgS at 2.5 A resolution. Like RecA from Escherichia coli, Dr RecA crystallizes as a helical filament that is closely related to its biologically relevant form, but with a ° more compressed pitch of 67 A. Although the overall fold of Dr RecA is similar to E. coli RecA, there is a large reorientation of the C-terminal domain, which in E. coli RecA has a site for binding dsDNA. Compared to E. coli RecA, the inner surface along the central axis of the Dr RecA filament has an increased positive electrostatic potential. Unique amino acid residues in Dr RecA cluster around a flexible b-hairpin that has also been implicated in DNA binding.

Introduction
Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr) is a Gram-positive bacterium well known for its ability to survive extreme doses of ionizing radiation.1,2 Though Dr is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of DNA damaging agents, it can recover from particularly high doses of ionizing radiation, which is known for producing dsDNA breaks. Since high doses of radiation lead to 150­200 dsDNA breaks per chromosome in Dr,3 radioresistance is largely due to highly proficient mechanisms of DNA repair. By contrast, Escherichia coli can survive only a few dsDNA breaks at a time. 4 Dr has a typical prokaryotic repertoire of DNA repair enzymes, though nearly one third of its genes encode proteins of unknown function that are not seen in other organisms.5,6

Homologous recombinational repair of dsDNA breaks by RecA protein is central to the extreme radioresistance of Dr, and several features of Dr RecA are unique. Dr recA mutants that are defective in recombination are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation.7,8 Whereas Dr UvrA and DNA polymerase I can be complemented by their respective E. coli genes without loss of radioresistance,9,10 this is not the case for Dr RecA,11 indicating it has unique functional properties that are essential. The amino acid sequences of E. coli and Dr RecA are 56% identical, but Dr RecA is toxic to E. coli unless its expression is repressed sufficiently.7,11 While RecA expression in E. coli is regulated by LexA repressor as part of the SOS response, Dr RecA expression is instead controlled by IrrE (also called PprI), a repressor protein unique to Dr that keeps the noninduced level of RecA unusually low.12,13 Dr contains four to ten genomic copies per cell,14 and this multiplicity is thought to greatly facilitate recombinational repair.15 The Dr genome has an unusual toroidal shape that may also facilitate dsDNA break repair by holding the two ends created at a break near one another.16 Dr has a RecA-independent pathway of dsDNA break repair

952 that functions at the early stages of recovery.17 However, this pathway, which is thought to be some form of single stranded annealing, accounts for only up to one third of the dsDNA breaks encountered. It has been suggested that the LexA coprotease activity of Dr RecA may be even more important to radioresistance than its recombinase activity,18 but Dr does not have a normal errorprone SOS response.19 Dr RecA has been overexpressed and purified from E. coli and characterized biochemically, revealing unusual features that parallel the genetic characteristics.20 Like E. coli RecA, Dr RecA forms right-handed helical filaments on DNA, hydrolyzes ATP and dATP in a DNA-dependent fashion, and promotes similar in vitro strand exchange reactions. Importantly, however, Dr RecA promotes the strand-exchange reaction via an inverse pathway.21 Whereas E. coli RecA and all other known recombinase enzymes, including human Rad51, polymerize on ssDNA and then incorporate dsDNA into the filament, Dr RecA first polymerizes on dsDNA. Consistent with this and also unusual, Dr does not contain genes for RecB and RecC, which along with RecD in E. coli process a dsDNA break into a long 3 0 ended ssDNA tail that is a substrate for RecA.22 Compared to E. coli RecA, Dr RecA also exhibits some interesting differences in ATP and dATP hydrolysis, and in the coupling of NTP hydrolysis to strand exchange. Since its discovery,23 Dr has been of keen interest for studying mechanisms of DNA repair for medical purposes as well as for processing toxic waste. Although the principles that underlie extreme radioresistance in Dr are multifaceted and poorly understood,24,25 it is clear that repair of dsDNA breaks by RecA is central to radioresistance, and that Dr RecA has many novel mechanistic features. Here, we have determined the X-ray ° crystal structure of Dr RecA at 2.5 A resolution in complex with ATPgS. The crystal structure reveals a significant reorientation of the dsDNA-binding C-terminal domain, an increased positive electrostatic potential along the inner surface of the filament, and structural changes in the flexible b6-b7 hairpin that has also been implicated in DNA binding.26 The structure thus suggests that these sites on the protein may play a role in dictating the inverse pathway of recombination and extreme radioresistance.

We overcame this problem by using a BL21-AI expression host in which T7 RNA polymerase is tightly regulated by the PBAD promoter.28 Prior to induction with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose, expression of Dr RecA is not detectable by SDS-PAGE and toxicity does not prohibit transformation or cell growth. The protein was purified by nickel affinity and anion exchange chromatography, and after thrombin cleavage, contains the extra residues Gly-Ser-His at the N terminus. Although the presence of extra N-terminal residues does not affect the coprotease or ssDNA-dependant ATPase activities of E. coli RecA, we have been unable to demonstrate ATPase or DNA strand exchange activity for this preparation of Dr RecA based on procedures reported for Dr RecA with a native sequence.20 Nonetheless, this Dr RecA protein crystallized in a typical filamentous form in complex with ATPgS and these crystals were pursued for the present study. As described below, the extra N-terminal residues, as well as the first 14 residues of the native Dr RecA sequence are disordered in the crystal structure, and thus they do not appear to contribute to the folded structure or the interactions at the monomer­monomer interface. It is conceivable that the N terminus of Dr RecA, which is extended by 12 residues compared to E. coli RecA, may have a role such as in DNA-binding that is disrupted by the presence of the extra N-terminal residues. However, the observation that the Dr RecA protein with the N-terminal His tag is toxic towards E. coli suggests that this protein is binding to DNA in vivo, since toxicity is thought to arise from increased DNA-binding.27 It has previously been observed that an extra glycine residue at the C terminus of Dr RecA alters its activities somewhat, though the protein does catalyze DNA strand-exchange reactions.20 Overall structure Like E. coli and mycobacterial RecA proteins,29­32 Dr RecA crystallizes in the absence of DNA as a 61-symmetric filament (Figure 1) that is similar to the biologically relevant, DNA-bound form of the protein. The helical pitch of the Dr RecA filament is ° 67 A, making it the most compressed of any RecA crystal structure seen to date. RecA­DNA filaments observed by electron microscopy generally are seen in two conformational states depending on the nucleotide cofactor: ATP or non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs produce an extended "active" filament with ° a helical pitch of w95 A , while ADP or no nucleotide produces a more compressed "inactive" ° filament with a pitch of w70 A.33 The available RecA crystal structures, all in the absence of DNA ° ° and ranging in pitch from 74 A to 83 A, are generally thought to represent the compressed, inactive conformation of the protein. By contrast, recent crystal structures of yeast Rad51 and Archaeal RadA are in an extended, "active" conformation in which the ATP-binding site has moved to the subunit interface.34,35 Thus, despite

Results and Discussion
Dr RecA was expressed as an N-terminal 6-His fusion protein in E. coli. As has been observed in some instances by other groups,7,20 Dr RecA was toxic to E. coli, to the extent in our case that the expression vector could not be transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Such toxicity, which has also been observed in certain E. coli RecA mutants, may be due to increased ssDNA or dsDNA binding that prevents proper chromosome segregation.27

953 represents the inactive conformation of the protein filament. Although ATP promotes the extended conformation of RecA filaments, structures of mycobacterial30­32 and E. coli RecA (Xing & C.E.B., unpublished results) in complex with ATP analogs are also seen in the compressed, inactive form. On the other hand, the structure of yeast Rad51 is in an extended form, despite the absence of bound nucleotide.34 Thus, for RecA and related recombinase enzymes, it seems that the crystal packing forces or solution parameters can influence the conformation (extended or compressed) of the filament observed in the crystal, perhaps to an even greater degree than the bound cofactor. It should be pointed out that although the compressed filaments are referred to as "inactive", the structures of the RecA protomer within them likely represent relevant conformations that occur during the catalytic cycle of the strand-exchange reaction, which is coordinated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. The overall structure of the Dr RecA monomer, which is similar to that of E. coli RecA,29 is organized into three domains (Figure 1): an N-terminal domain that forms much of the monomer­monomer interface, a central core domain that in E. coli RecA has the ATP and principal DNA-binding sites,36 and a C-terminal domain that, in the case of E. coli RecA, has been shown to bind to dsDNA.37 The core domains of E. coli and Dr RecA superimpose to an rmsd of ° 0.71 A for 197 pairs of Ca atoms. As in E. coli RecA structures, electron density is absent for residues at the N and C termini (residues 1­14 and 342­363 in Dr RecA), and for the two presumed DNA-binding loops, Dr RecA residues 168­175 and 208­222, all of which are not included in the refined model. It should be noted that in Dr RecA, the disordered region at the N terminus is extended by 12 residues compared to E. coli RecA. In addition, residues 245­250 at the turn of the extended b6-b7 hairpin of Dr RecA are not modeled due to disorder. In E. coli RecA, the residues at the turn of the b6-b7 hairpin are present in the model, but flexible compared to the rest of the structure. Domain movements When the Dr and E. coli RecA crystal structures are superimposed by their core domains (Figure 2(a)), movements of the N and C-terminal domains are evident. The N-terminal domain packs against the adjacent monomer in the filament, and thus the slight change in its position in Dr RecA results from the subtle re-packing of monomers in the more compressed helical filament. The movement of the C-terminal domain is a much more dramatic 148 rotation about the axis shown in Figure 2(b). The C-terminal domain is of particular interest because it contains a dsDNA-binding site involving a patch of conserved residues, including Lys302, Trp290, and Gly301 in E. coli RecA.37 In addition, EM studies of E. coli RecA­DNA filaments

the binding of ATPgS in the present structure, the compressed pitch, absence of DNA, and overall similarity to the previous RecA structures support the notion that the Dr RecA crystal structure

The black line shows the filament axis with the 5 0 -3 0 polarity61 indicated, and the green line shows the axis about which the 148 rotation of the C-terminal domain occurs. (c) Close up view of the reorientation of the C-terminal domain. The view is the same as in (b).

The corresponding residues in Dr RecA, also shown in ball-and-stick, are Phe303 and Lys315.

indicate that ATP-mediated conformational changes involve significant movements of the C-terminal domain.38,39 The emerging view is that after E. coli RecA has polymerized on ssDNA, the CTD functions as a "gateway" for entry of dsDNA into the filament and that this process is coordinated by ATP-mediated conformational changes. The rotation of the C-terminal domain seen here in the Dr RecA structure displaces the supposed

dsDNA-binding site at the tip of the C-terminal ° domain by approximately 7 A in a direction that is away from the filament axis and towards the 5 0 end of the filament (Figure 2(b)). It would seem quite likely that this repositioning of the C-terminal domain in Dr RecA is related in some way to its unique DNA-binding properties. Similar, though less dramatic C-terminal domain movements have been seen in different E. coli RecA crystal structures

955 interactions that build up the filament, though this possibility cannot be excluded. Rather, the N-terminal residues 1­14 of Dr RecA, along with the extra Gly-Ser-His residues, are located on the outer surface of the filament where they most likely extend out into solvent. ATP-binding pocket Electron density for ATPgS in the active site of Dr RecA was very clear (Figure 3(a)), allowing for ° accurate placement of the entire cofactor. At 2.5 A resolution, this is the most detailed view for any RecA­nucleotide complex that has been reported. The density for the g-thiophosphate group, though complete, was somewhat weaker than for the rest of the ATPgS molecule, indicating it has increased mobility. This is consistent with the idea that the crystallized complex represents an "inactive" conformation in which the protein is not fully engaged with the g-thiophosphate group. The g-thiophosphate of ATPgS does make close contacts with the side-chains of Gln206 and Thr85 of Dr RecA (Figure 3(b)). In E. coli RecA, Gln194, which corresponds to Gln206 of Dr RecA, is thought to be a key mediator of the allosteric effect of ATP,41 serving as a link between the g-phosphate and the loop 2 residues 195­211 that are thought to be the primary DNA-binding site. Despite the interaction of Gln206 of Dr RecA with the g-thiophosphate of ATPgS observed here, the loop 2 residues remain disordered, again consistent with the complex representing an "inactive" conformation. Curiously, although magnesium ion is included in the crystallization mixture, there is no density for magnesium in the active site, as is also seen in some nucleotide complexes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecA.30,31 Of the residues of Dr RecA that interact with ATPgS (Figure 3(b)), only two, Lys239 and Gly82, have different side-chains than the corresponding residues in E. coli and mycobacterial RecA molecules. Lys239 in Dr RecA makes a close contact with the O3 0 hydroxyl of ATPgS. The corresponding residue in M. tuberculosis RecA, Arg228, can form a similar interaction with bound nucleotides,30,31 although in most of the reported complexes it does not. Conceivably, Lys239 in Dr RecA could be important in relaying information from the ATPbinding site to C-terminal regions of the protein. Gly82, which lies within the highly conserved P-loop motif of Dr RecA (residues 78­85), is of particular interest because this amino acid position, which is Ser70 in E. coli RecA, is nearly invariant across 63 eubacterial RecA sequences.42 Only in Dr and in closely related Thermus species, where glycine is found, is serine not seen at this position. In Dr RecA, Gly82 does not appear to lead to any significant change in the overall conformation of the P-loop, and its backbone amide forms a hydrogen bond to the b-phosphate of ATPgS. While Gly82 in Dr RecA may allow for backbone conformations not accessible in other RecA molecules, the phi­psi torsion angles of Gly82 in the present structure are

° ° with pitches ranging from 74 A to 83 A.29,40 Thus, it is possible that the rotation of the C-terminal domain seen here for Dr RecA arises from a coupling between the filament extension and C-terminal domain position that is a more general feature of RecA. Mycobacterial RecA structures, ° which have a pitch of w73 A, show some slight variation in the C-terminal domain position, but are much closer to that observed for E. coli.30­32 Though the conformation of the C-terminal domain observed here for Dr RecA could be influenced by the bound ATPgS, a wide variety of nucleotides bound to mycobacterial RecA structures do not significantly alter the position of the C-terminal domain. In all RecA crystal structures, the C-terminal domain is intimately involved in the crystal packing interactions, which also could influence its observed orientation. Analysis of multiple crystal forms is thus necessary to fully understand the meaning of the conformational differences. Nonetheless, the more dramatic nature of the C-terminal domain reorientation observed here for Dr RecA is suggestive of the C-terminal domain having some role in dictating its specialized DNA binding properties. Monomer­monomer interface The functional differences between E. coli and Dr RecA do not appear to be due to any obvious differences in the packing of monomers to form the filament. The monomer­monomer interaction in the ° Dr RecA filament, which buries a total of 2650 A2 of solvent accessible surface area, is highly similar to that seen in the E. coli RecA filament,29 which buries ° 2770 A2. Of the 61 amino acid residues buried at the interface, 45 (74%) have side-chains that are identical in E. coli and Dr RecA, making the subunit interface more conserved than the rest of the protein. Nearly all of the hydrogen bonds (8/9) formed at the interface in Dr RecA are also seen in E. coli RecA, as is one of the two ion pairs, that between Lys263-Asp132. A second ion pair at the subunit interface in Dr RecA between Lys40 and Glu125 is not seen in E. coli RecA, but is compensated for by a different ion pair between Lys6Asp139 of E. coli RecA. In both proteins, the monomer­monomer interaction involves the headto-tail packing of a positively charged surface on one monomer with a negatively charged surface on the neighboring monomer. In both cases, most of the charged residues do not form direct ion pairs. Rather, more long-range electrostatic interactions are formed between two complementarily charged surfaces. Although the N-terminal helix plays a key role in forming the monomer­monomer interface (Figure 1), the first N-terminal residue visualized ° in the crystal structure, Ala15, is w10 A away from the neighboring monomer. Thus, it does not appear likely that the extra N-terminal Gly-Ser-His residues of the Dr RecA protein used for this study interfere with or alter the monomer­monomer

All potential hydrogen ° bonds within 3.5 A are shown as black dotted lines. Notice that six consecutive amide groups of the P-loop form potential hydrogen bonds to the phosphates.

the same as in E. coli RecA, which has serine at this position. As is seen in structures of mycobacterial RecA in complex with ATP analogs, the P-loop of Dr RecA in the complex with ATPgS is slightly "open" relative to its conformation in uncomplexed E. coli RecA. The Ser70 side-chain in E. coli RecA is in a position to hydrogen bond to the b-phosphate of ATP and to the Lys72 3-amino group. Since in E. coli RecA Lys72, along with Glu96, is one of the two key residues thought to participate directly in the ATPhydrolysis reaction,43,44 the absence of the serine side-chain in Dr RecA could conceivably affect the ATPase reaction or the relay of allosteric information. Compared to E. coli RecA, Dr RecA does exhibit some interesting differences in the rates of hydrolysis of ATP and dATP and the extent to which they are coupled to the DNA strandexchange reaction.20 In particular, Dr RecA hydrolyzes dATP more efficiently than ATP, and Dr RecA displaces SSB from ssDNA more efficiently in the presence of dATP than with ATP. However, in

contrast with ATP, the hydrolysis of dATP is poorly coupled to strand exchange. It would seem likely that the presence of Gly82 instead of serine at this position within the P-loop could at least in part account for these differences. Along these lines, a Ser69Gly substitution at the neighboring position in E. coli RecA leads to differential rates of hydrolysis of ATP, dATP, and ddATP, which are coupled to the rate of strand exchange.45 Amino acid residues of Dr RecA near the hydroxyl groups of the bound ATPgS, such as Lys239 (Figure 3(b)) could also play a role in the differential coupling of dATP and ATP hydrolysis to strand-exchange observed for Dr RecA. One final residue of note is Tyr277, a nearly invariant residue that in E. coli RecA (Tyr264) is well known for photo-crosslinking to 8-azido-ATP.46 In Dr RecA, this side-chain packs against the adenine ring of ATPgS (Figure 3(b)). In all other RecA structures this tyrosine side-chain is either disordered or rotated to close over the ribose moiety of bound nucleotides.30­32 Due to its proximity to the

957 its observed preference for polymerizing on dsDNA instead of ssDNA. It should be pointed out that several disordered residues are absent from the two structures and thus not included in the electrostatic calculations. These include the two primary DNA binding loops that point towards the filament axis, and several residues at the N and C termini. Within the disordered DNA-binding loop 2 of Dr RecA (residues 208­222), there is a glutamate at position 209 that is a methionine in E. coli RecA, although glutamate is commonly seen at this position in other RecA sequences. The E. coli RecA sequence has a high density of negatively charged residues near its C terminus, a feature that, though commonly seen in other RecA proteins, is less prevalent in Dr RecA. Instead, Dr RecA has an unusual Ala and Pro-rich sequence at its C terminus, the function of which is unknown. E. coli RecA molecules missing the C-terminal w20 residues have enhanced DNAbinding properties, including an increased rate of binding to dsDNA.48­50 Thus, the C terminus of Dr RecA could quite likely play a role in modulating its DNA binding properties. Finally, the N terminus of Dr RecA is extended by 12 residues compared to E. coli RecA, and this segment has two negatively and two positively charged residues. Amino acid positions in Dr RecA with residue types not seen in other RecA sequences It is conceivable that the unusual DNA-binding

ribose moiety, this residue could conceivably be partly responsible for dictating the differential binding and hydrolysis of dATP and ATP by Dr RecA and other RecA proteins. Surface electrostatics There are some differences in the positions of charged amino acid residues within the sequences of E. coli and Dr RecA that do not alter the polypeptide backbone structure, but nonetheless have a substantial effect on the electrostatic surface potential (Figure 4), which could in turn influence the interactions with DNA substrates. While both E. coli and Dr RecA filaments exhibit a significant dipole, with the 5 0 end positively charged and the 3 0 end negatively charged, the detailed electrostatic features are quite different. In particular, the surface of the Dr RecA filament facing the central axis and the 5 0 end is significantly more positively charged than in the E. coli RecA filament. This appears to be due in part to the presence of two additional positively charged residues in Dr RecA, Arg225 and Arg341, as well as the absence of two negatively charged residues, Glu86 and Glu38, that are present in E. coli RecA (Figure 5). The Dr RecA amino acid sequence has a predicted net charge of C4 higher than E. coli RecA, although the estimated pI of Dr RecA of 5.5 is very close to the average measured value of 5.6 for E. coli RecA.47 Conceivably, the increased positive charge along the central cavity of the Dr RecA filament could have a role in dictating

Notice the increased positive charge along the upper (5 0 end) and inner surface of the Dr RecA filament (left), as compared to the E. coli RecA filament (right). The large blue patch at the very top of each filament is covered by the next subunit in the polymer, and thus not exposed to solvent except at the very end of the filament.

A stereo view of the Dr RecA monomer is shown as a magenta Ca-trace in the same orientation as Figures 1(a) and 2(a). Amino acid side-chains of residues shaded green or blue in (a) are shown in green or blue ball-and-stick. Notice that many of the side-chains that are different in Dr RecA cluster together in the region of the structure between the C-terminal domain and the ATP-binding pocket, particularly around the b6-b7 hairpin, near residues 243­252.

properties of Dr RecA could be conferred on the protein through a small number of critical amino acid residues. Along these lines there are w24 amino acid positions within Dr RecA that have sidechains that are seen exclusively in Dr RecA (9/24) or uncommonly seen in other RecA sequences, based on an alignment of 63 eubacterial RecA sequences.42 These are mapped onto the structure in Figure 5. Surprisingly, none of these amino acid positions are located within either of the two presumed DNA-binding loops of Dr RecA, the sequences of which are nearly identical in Dr and E. coli RecA. Instead, many of the residues with

different side-chains in Dr RecA are located in the region of the structure between the C-terminal domain and the ATP-binding pocket. In particular, the region around the b6-b7 hairpin of Dr RecA has a high density of side-chains that are not seen or uncommonly seen in other RecA sequences. For example, Ala252 of Dr RecA, which is located at the beginning of b strand 7, is a glycine residue in all of the other 62 RecA sequences examined. The structural consequence of this substitution in Dr RecA, which adds a methyl group, is to twist the b6-b7 hairpin away from b-strand 8 (Figures 2(a) and 5). Similarly, the nearby Gln242 and Pro243 on

959 RecA filament, and the C-terminal domain associates with the second DNA molecule (dsDNA) to facilitate its pairing with the first DNA. Since Dr RecA catalyzes DNA strand-exchange by an inverse mechanism, it would seem likely that its C-terminal domain may bind specifically to ssDNA instead of dsDNA, coordinating the entry of ssDNA to the central axis of the filament to pair with dsDNA. We have already mentioned that the increased positive charge along the central axis of the Dr RecA filament may provide a structural basis for the observed preference of Dr RecA for polymerizing on dsDNA instead of ssDNA. With this model in mind, it is interesting to note structural differences between the C-terminal domains of Dr RecA and E. coli RecA that would dictate a possible preference for ssDNA versus dsDNA. Although the positioning of the C-terminal domain is different in the E. coli RecA and Dr. RecA structures, the overall fold is quite similar: the two structures can be super° imposed to an rmsd of 0.72 A for all Ca atoms. However, there are a few key amino acid changes in Dr RecA that are in the vicinity of the observed dsDNA-binding site on the E. coli RecA C-terminal domain (Figure 6). The site on the C-terminal domain of E. coli RecA that interacts with dsDNA, as determined by chemical shift perturbation of backbone 1H and 15N, includes Gly301, Lys302, Ala303, Asn304, Ile298, and Trp290, many of which are highly conserved. These residues form a patch on the surface of the C-terminal domain at the N-terminal end of helix I, which could interact favorably through a helix dipole interaction with the negatively charged phosphates of DNA. It should be noted that since the NMR study only looked at backbone atoms, the study gives the general region of the binding site, but not all of the interacting residues. One potentially key amino acid difference in Dr RecA is Phe303. This residue, which is Trp290 in E. coli RecA, is a tryptophan in 61 of 63 RecA sequences. Given the proximity of this residue to the dsDNA binding site, its high conservation in RecA sequences, and its unique occurrence as phenylalanine in Dr RecA, it would seem to be a likely candidate in dictating a possible specificity for binding to ssDNA. Another residue change at the supposed DNA-binding site is Glu316 in Dr RecA, which is Ala303 in Ec RecA. In Dr RecA the Glu316 side-chain contacts the backbone, and thus neutralizes the positive charge at the N-terminal end of helix I. Thus, having glutamate at this position could potentially favor binding to ssDNA instead of dsDNA. It should be noted, however, that glutamate is the consensus amino acid type at this residue position, and thus it is not unique to Dr RecA. Somewhat further away from the N-terminal end of helix I, Lys280 and Lys282 of E. coli RecA are replaced by Asp293 and Asp295 of Dr RecA. The replacement of the positively charged residues with negatively charged residues in Dr RecA at these positions could also dictate a preference for ssDNA, although there are other

b-strand 6 of Dr RecA are an insertion and an amino acid type not seen at this position in other RecA sequences that result in a bulge in b-strand 6, causing a further distortion of the b6-b7 hairpin. Val246 is another amino acid within this b-hairpin of Dr RecA that is rarely seen at this position in other RecA sequences, although residues 245­250 are disordered and not included in the model. The b6-b7 hairpin of E. coli RecA is a site of UVcrosslinking to ssDNA26 and mutations of Arg243 and Lys245 of this hairpin disrupt binding of E. coli RecA to DNA.51 Thus, it would seem likely that the b6-b7 hairpin is a particular region of Dr RecA that could play a role in dictating its unique DNAbinding properties. Other highly conserved amino acid positions within RecA that have a different side-chain in Dr RecA include Phe303 and Gly289, both within the C-terminal domain. Phe303, which is a highly conserved tryptophan in other RecA sequences (Trp290 in E. coli RecA), is located on a surface of the C-terminal domain near several other highly conserved residues that form a binding site for dsDNA in E. coli RecA, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance studies of its isolated C-terminal domain.37 Gly289 of Dr RecA, which occurs within helix H of the C-terminal domain, is an Asp, Glu, Lys, or Asn in all other RecA sequences. One final amino acid position of note, Thr259 in Dr RecA, is either Ile or Val in all of the other 62 RecA sequences. This residue is at the top of b7 and facing the interior of the monomer. In Dr RecA, the side-chain of Thr259 interacts with a buried and very well-ordered water molecule or possible ion (but modeled as a water) that is also bonded to the side-chain of Asn262 and the backbone carbonyl groups of Ala62 and Pro266. Structural implications for the inverse mechanism of strand exchange In strand-exchange reactions promoted by E. coli RecA, the protein first polymerizes on ssDNA and then incorporates dsDNA into the RecA­ssDNA filament. Dr RecA catalyzes DNA strand exchange reactions via an unprecedented inverse mechanism in which the protein polymerizes first on dsDNA, and then incorporates ssDNA into the filament. In the case of E. coli RecA, the ssDNA on which the protein first polymerizes is bound along the central axis of the filament, through interactions most likely involving the disordered loops L1 and L2.36 If E. coli RecA is added to dsDNA instead of ssDNA, then the protein will polymerize on dsDNA, with dsDNA bound along the central axis of the filament. According to NMR studies,37 the isolated C-terminal domain of E. coli RecA binds to dsDNA, but not to ssDNA, and a "gateway" model has been proposed in which the C-terminal domain coordinates the entry of dsDNA to the central axis of the filament where the ssDNA is bound. Thus, the first DNA (ssDNA in normal reactions) binds along the central axis of the E. coli

Figure 6. Comparison of the structures of the Cterminal domains of Dr RecA and E. coli RecA in the vicinity of the dsDNA-binding site of E. coli RecA. (a) Ribbon drawing of the E. coli RecA C-terminal domain (PDB code 2REB),29 with selected amino acid residues shown in ball-and-stick. The dsDNA-binding site determined by chemical shift perturbation of backbone 1H and 15 N involves residues Gly301, Lys302, and Ala303.37 The view is the same as in Figure 1(a). (b) Ribbon drawing of the Dr RecA C-terminal domain with selected amino acid residues shown in ball-and-stick. Notice that Glu316 of Dr RecA caps the N-terminal end of helix I, which is the observed binding-site of the E. coli RecA C-terminal domain to dsDNA. Also notice that Lys280 and Lys282 of E. coli RecA are replaced with Asp293 and Asp295 of Dr RecA. Gln300 and Gly301 of E. coli RecA are invariant among RecA enzymes, and Lys302 is almost always lysine or arginine.

RecA protein is central to the extreme radioresistance of Dr, and accordingly, Dr RecA catalyzes DNA strand-exchange via an unprecedented, inverse reaction pathway. The structure of DrRecA provides a three-dimensional framework that will be useful in designing mutational experiments to unravel the mechanistic basis for the unique biochemical features that contribute to radioresistance. While the overall structures of Dr and E. coli RecA are similar, key differences include a large rotation of the C-terminal domain that interacts with dsDNA, an increased positive electrostatic surface potential along the central groove of the filament, and an altered conformation of the b6-b7 hairpin. The structural consequences of amino acid positions that have unique side-chains in Dr RecA provide further clues to understanding the unique biochemical properties that lead to radioresistance. A more detailed understanding of the unique DNAbinding properties of Dr RecA, and the mechanism of homologous recombination in general is significantly limited by the absence of a structure of a RecA­DNA complex for any RecA molecule. Moreover, parts of Dr RecA not resolved in the structure, in particular the DNA binding loops and residues at the N and C termini, may play significant roles in dictating the DNA-binding properties. Nonetheless, the structure of the ATPgS complex reported here offers valuable insights that should serve as a useful starting point. Understanding the structural and functional differences between E. coli and Dr RecA should shed light on the biochemical mechanism of homologous recombination in general, a process that is still poorly understood in many respects.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, expression, and protein purification D. radiodurans genomic DNA was isolated from strain R1 (ATCC number 13939) and the recA gene was PCR amplified and ligated into pET-14b (Novagen) using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. This vector produces Dr RecA protein with an N-terminal 6-His tag and an intervening thrombin cleavage site. The correctness of the gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen), and six 1 l cultures were grown at 37 8C in LB broth. Cultures were induced at A600 nmZ0.6 with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose, incubated an additional four hours at 37 8C, harvested by centrifugation and frozen at K80 8C. Thawed cells were suspended in sonication buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0)), 0.1 mg/ml PMSF, 1 mg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme were added, and the mixture was incubated for one hour on ice prior to sonication. After sonication and centrifugation, the clarified lysate was loaded onto a 15 ml Ni-NTA fast flow column (Qiagen). After extensive washing overnight with sonication buffer containing 30 mM imidazole, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 30­500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing Dr RecA were pooled and dialyzed into thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mM NaH 2PO 4, 150 mM NaCl

A homology model of Dr RecA was constructed from the E. coli RecA structure (PDB code 2REB)29 using the Swiss Model server, and used as the search model for molecular replacement by the AMoRe program54 of CCP4 suite.55 The structure was refined using rigid body, torsion angle simulated annealing, and individual temperature factor protocols of Crystallography & NMR System.56 After the first round of refinement, it was clear that the C-terminal domain was positioned incorrectly, and the density corresponding to the C-terminal domain was not interpretable. The solvent flipping procedure in CNS dramatically improved the electron density for the C-terminal domain, which was manually positioned as a rigid body into the density using the program O.57 The entire model was rebuilt to fit within the density, and at later stages complete density was observed for the ATPgS molecule, which was added to the model, along with 27 water molecules. Due to a lack of electron density, residues 1­14 (plus the extra three residues from the expression vector), 168­175, 208­222, 245­250, and 342­363 were not included in the model. Figures were prepared using MOSCRIPT,58 Raster3D,59 and GRASP.60

(pH 7.4)). The Dr RecA­6 His fusion protein was digested with 50 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) at 22 8C for w24 hours and then loaded back onto the Ni-NTA column to remove any uncleaved Dr RecA and remaining impurities. The flow-through fractions were pooled and dialyzed into 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), loaded onto a 25 ml HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a linear gradient of 0­1 M NaCl. Pooled fractions were dialyzed into 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, concentrated to 44 mg/ml, aliquoted and stored at K80 8C. The final Dr RecA protein contains the extra N-terminal sequence Gly-Ser-His. Sequence numbering follows the convention of Narumi et al.,52 assuming a 363-residue protein beginning with Met1. Protein concentration was determined by A280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 10,240 MK1 cmK1, which was calculated from the amino acid sequence.53 Protein concentration was also checked by Bradford assay, which gave similar values. Crystallization, X-ray data collection, and structure determination Crystals were grown at 22 8C by hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing 2 ml of 10 mg/ml Dr RecA, 2 mM ATPgS, 4 mM magnesium chloride, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, with 2 ml of reservoir solution containing 50 mM Mes (pH 6.5), 200 mM ammonium acetate, 50 mM calcium chloride, and 9.7% (w/v) PEG 4000. Crystals were transferred to artificial mother liquor solution supplemented with 30% (w/v) sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a rotating anode generator and an R-AXIS IVCC image plate (Rigaku), and processed with Crystal Clear software (Molecular Structure Corporation). The ° structure was initially solved using a 3.0 A data set, and ° later refined using an improved 2.5 A data set (Table 1). Table 1. Data collection and refinement statistics
