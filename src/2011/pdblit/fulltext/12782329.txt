Transformation of MutL by ATP Binding and Hydrolysis: A Switch in DNA Mismatch Repair
Changill Ban, Murray Junop, and Wei Yang* Laboratory of Molecular Biology National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Maryland 20892 MutL family have not been determined, and even those of E. coli MutL have remained elusive for many years. MutL and its homologs have molecular weights ranging from 70 to 90 kDa and form either homo- or heterodimers of the same family in solution. All members of the MutL family share a conserved N-terminal region of 300 residues (Ban and Yang, 1998a). The divergent C-terminal region is responsible for dimer formation (Pang et al., 1997; Drotschmann et al., 1998). The crystal structure of the conserved N-terminal 40 kDa fragment from E. coli MutL (LN40) has been recently determined (Ban and Yang, 1998a). MutL was not known to have enzymatic activity prior to determination of the crystal structure (Yamaguchi et al., 1998). However, the crystal structure of LN40 revealed a striking similarity to an ATPase fragment from DNA gyrase B subunit (NGyrB) and to an ATP-binding domain of Hsp90 (Wigley et al., 1991; Prodromou et al., 1997; Stebbins et al., 1997). All the residues essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis in DNA gyrase and Hsp90 families are also conserved in the MutL family (Ban and Yang, 1998a). Low ATPase activity ( 0.5/min) has since been detected with purified MutL (Ban and Yang, 1998a). MutL, Hsp90, and type II DNA topoisomerases including DNA gyrase thus form an emerging ATPase superfamily, the DNA Gyrase, HSP90, and MutL (GHL) superfamily. This GHL ATPase superfamily lacks conventional ATPase motifs, such as Walker boxes, but is characterized by a set of four sequence motifs (Ban and Yang, 1998a). Sequences related to these four motifs have also been identified in the bacterial histidine kinase family despite their rather different catalytic mechanisms (Mushegian et al., 1997). Recently determined structures of bacterial histidine kinases show a similar ATP-binding site but altered catalytic residues compared with the GHL family (Tanaka et al., 1998; Bilwes et al., 1999). The ATPase activity of the MutL family appears to be essential for the DNA repair function, as the majority of the mutations in human MLH1 found in the HNPCC kindreds (Peltomaki and Vasen, 1997; Shimodaira et al., ¨ 1998; Shcherbakova and Kunkel, 1999) and almost all of the mutations in E. coli MutL causing the dominant mutator phenotype (Aronshtam, 1996) are in or around the ATP-binding site (Ban and Yang, 1998a). The exact function of MutL and the role of its ATP binding and hydrolysis in the context of DNA mismatch repair, however, remain unknown. In the DNA mismatch repair machinery, MutS and its homologs are known to possess both ATPase activity and mismatch recognition function (Modrich, 1991). The ATPase activity of MutS has been interpreted as signaling the detection of a mismatch and initiating the assembly of a DNA repair machinery (Modrich, 1991). Hydrolysis of ATP by MutL has been shown to be relatively slow with a kcat of 0.4 min 1 compared to an average of 10­100 min 1 for most ATPases (Ban and Yang, 1998a). The main questions regarding the MutL ATPase activity include whether the low catalytic activity is activated by other molecules and how ATP binding and hydrolysis by MutL are integrated into the DNA mismatch repair machinery.

Summary The MutL DNA mismatch repair protein has recently been shown to be an ATPase and to belong to an emerging ATPase superfamily that includes DNA topoisomerase II and Hsp90. We report here the crystal structures of a 40 kDa ATPase fragment of E. coli MutL (LN40) complexed with a substrate analog, ADPnP, and with product ADP. More than 60 residues that are disordered in the apoprotein structure become ordered and contribute to both ADPnP binding and dimerization of LN40. Hydrolysis of ATP, signified by subsequent release of the -phosphate, releases two key loops and leads to dissociation of the LN40 dimer. Dimerization of the LN40 region is required for and is the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis by MutL. The ATPase activity of MutL is stimulated by DNA and likely acts as a switch to coordinate DNA mismatch repair.

Introduction MutL and its homologs, the MLH and PMS proteins, constitute a family of proteins that are essential for DNA mismatch repair in species ranging from Escherichia coli to humans (reviewed by Kolodner, 1996; Modrich and Lahue, 1996). Together with the mismatch recognition protein MutS, MutL is required for initiation as well as subsequent steps in methyl-dependent DNA mismatch repair in E. coli (Modrich and Lahue, 1996). MutL interacts directly with a sequence-specific endonuclease MutH and UvrD helicase (Ban and Yang, 1998a; Hall et al., 1998) and has also been implicated in other DNA repair pathways, such as very short repair (VSR) (Drotschmann et al., 1998) and transcription-coupled repair (Mellon and Champe, 1996). In eukaryotes, in addition to being involved in mismatch repair, MLH and PMS proteins have been shown to play a role in gene conversion and chromosome segregation during and after meiosis (Williamson et al., 1985; Hunter and Borts, 1997). Human homologs of MutL, hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2, clearly influence the stability of genome, particularly in the case of small nucleotide repeats (Strand et al., 1993). Mutations in these MutL homologs have been directly linked to increased susceptibility to hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) in humans (reviewed by Umar and Kunkel, 1996). However, the exact functions of the

Over 60 residues are disordered in the crystal structure of LN40 without ligand, most of which are highly conserved in the MutL family (Ban and Yang, 1998a). These disordered regions are distributed over a large surface of the protein with some adjacent to the putative ATP-binding site. Nucleotide binding has been proposed to induce structural ordering within MutL and to modulate interactions between MutL and other macromolecules, such as MutH, UvrD, MutS, and DNA during mismatch repair (Ban and Yang, 1998a). Conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding in both LN40 and MutL have been demonstrated by biochemical methods (Ban and Yang, 1998a). LN40 undergoes a transition from monomer to dimer upon binding a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ADPnP. The intact MutL protein, which is already dimerized via the C-terminal region, transforms from having an exceedingly large to a smaller Stoke's radius upon binding of ADPnP. A similar monomer-to-dimer transition induced by nucleotide has also been demonstrated in the topoisomerase II family (Wigley et al., 1991; Roca and Wang, 1992). Although several structures of GHL family members have been determined, a corresponding pair of nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound structures has not been reported. The first structure reported for the GHL superfamily was that of the NgyrB­ADPnP complex (Wigley et al., 1991), but no structural information is available for the nucleotide-free form of NgyrB. Structures of both nucleotide-bound and free forms of a fragment of Hsp90 have been determined, but the crystallized fragment lacks the -phosphate-binding region and is inactive as an ATPase (Prodromou et al., 1997). Therefore, a detailed comparison of these two states has not been possible. It is intriguing whether MutL has a similar dimeric structure when bound to ADPnP as observed in NgyrB and whether there is a common theme for this new ATPase superfamily in their mode of ATP utilization. We report here (1) the crystal structures of LN40 complexed with ADP·Mg2 and with ADPnP·Mg2 at 2.1 and ° 1.9 A, respectively, (2) analyses of the structural transformation induced by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis,

Results and Discussion Structure Determination of the LN40­Nucleotide Complexes The LN40­ADPnP complex was purified over a Sephadex-200 size exclusion column after incubating pure LN40 with ADPnP. The LN40­ADPnP complex forms a dimer with a molecular weight of 80 kDa as judged from size exclusion chromatography and equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Crystals were readily grown from the purified LN40­ADPnP complex and diffracted X-rays be° yond 1.9 A, unlike crystals of the apoprotein LN40, which ° were difficult to grow and diffracted weakly to 2.9 A. The crystal of the nucleotide­LN40 complex belongs to space group I222 with one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). Crystal packing of the LN40­ADPnP complex was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of LN40 as a search model (see Experimental Procedures). The dimer of the LN40­ADPnP complex is generated by a crystallographic two-fold symmetry axis. The structure was refined using CNS (Brunger et al., ¨ 1998). The final model, containing one ADPnP molecule, a Mg2 ion, and residues 1­331 of MutL, is refined to an R value of 21.3% and Rfree of 26.1% (Table 1 and Figure 1). Pure LN40 was also incubated with ATP and purified over a Sephadex-200 column, where it behaved like a monomer and eluted at the same time point as the nucleotide-free protein (data not shown). This nucleotide­protein complex did, however, show a distinct increase of absorption at 260 nm, indicating the presence of a bound nucleotide. Crystals were grown from this purified ATP­LN40 complex at room temperature over a period of 2 weeks and proved isomorphous to those of ADPnP­LN40 (Table 1). The crystal structure of this

nucleotide­protein complex contained minor modifications relative to that of the ADPnP­LN40 complex and ° was refined to R of 23.1% and Rfree of 25.2% at 2.1 A resolution. Interestingly, the final refined structure contains LN40 and ADP, but not ATP (Figures 2a and 2b). Water molecules occupy the site vacated by the -phosphate. No ATP or free phosphate was detected in the crystal even when additional free ATP was added to the initial crystallization droplets. ATP Hydrolysis by LN40 ATP is evidently hydrolyzed by LN40, and the hydrolysis probably occurred at every step from incubation of protein with nucleotide to crystallization. This finding was surprising because, while the intact MutL has been shown to be an ATPase, LN40 previously showed no detectable ATPase activity (Ban and Yang, 1998a). The apparent ATP hydrolysis by LN40 revealed in the crystal

structure seems to result from the high protein concentration. Studies in solution have since detected a protein concentration­dependent ATPase activity of LN40 (Figure 2c). The ATPase activity of LN40 with a kcat of 0.05 min 1 is nearly 10-fold lower than that of the intact MutL (Figure 2c); nevertheless, it demonstrates that LN40 contains all the necessary elements for catalysis. The intact MutL used in the ATPase activity assay contains an additional 20 residues at its N terminus, including six histidines for easy purification. To determine whether the N-terminal His tag influences the MutL ATPase activity, a MutL construct with an authentic N terminus and a C-terminal His tag was made, and the protein was purified. The ATPase activity was found to be similar despite removal of the N-terminal His tag (Table 2). This result is in good agreement with the ATPase activity detected in LN40 that does not have an N-terminal His tag. The different catalytic activity of

MutL versus LN40 (Figure 2c) is most likely due to the C-terminal region that dimerizes MutL (more discussion later).

Structures of LN40­ADPnP and LN40­ADP Complexes The LN40­ADPnP structure provides a complete trace of LN40 including the five loops, L1, L2, L3, L45, and the ATP lid, that were disordered in the LN40 structure (Figures 3a and 3b). The addition of over 60 residues gives the LN40 structure a new overall shape, which no longer resembles an elbow (Figures 3a and 3b). The protein retains the same two structural domains as in the LN40 structure (Figure 3a), but the relative orientation between the two domains has changed by an 18 rotation, which brings them closer to each other (Figure 3b). ° Despite the relative rotation, each domain of the 2.9 A ° LN40 structure is remarkably similar to the 1.9 A structure of the LN40­ADPnP complex. The rms deviation of all main chain atoms following superposition of individ° ual domains is less than 0.5 A except for the ATP lid, which was anticipated to change upon nucleotide binding (Ban and Yang, 1998a). In addition to these changes within one polypeptide chain, the LN40­ADPnP complex forms dimers both in solution and in the crystal. The dimer interface is well ordered and made entirely of

the segments that were disordered in the apoprotein structure (Figures 3c and 3d). The N-terminal 20 residues, which constitute the first disordered loop (L1) in the LN40 structure, form a short strand ( 1 ) and three turns of helix ( A ) (Figure 1) in the LN40­ADPnP complex. As also observed in the ADPnP­NgyrB structure (Wigley et al., 1991), 1 extends away from one subunit of the dimer and interacts with the ATP-binding site of the other subunit (Figure 3c). The A contributes to the core of the dimer interface (Figure 3c). Residues 74­97 form the so-called ATP lid upon nucleotide association. This ATP lid can be divided into three portions. The first and the third portions (residues 74­79 and 93­97) form the stem or the joint of the ATP lid and determine the orientation of helix C in the middle (residues 80­90) (Figure 3b). In the absence of nucleotide, the first portion is disordered, and helix C is projected adjacent to helix B by the third portion (Figure 3a). In the ADPnP­LN40 complex, the first portion adopts an extended yet well-ordered conformation, the third portion is reoriented, and both interact with the bound nucleotide. Together, they move helix C over ° 20 A toward the dimer interface (Figure 3b). The L2 and L3 loops (residues 150­162 and 299­313, respectively), which were disordered in the LN40 structure, form substantial secondary structures (Figures 1 and 3) in the presence of nucleotide. The previously missing turn between strands 4 and 5 (L45, residues 126­131) also becomes ordered by interactions with the L1 loop (Figure 1). The conserved L3 loop extends from the second domain toward the first domain and interacts with both the ATP lid and the L1 loop (Figure 3b). The conserved Lys-307 on the L3 loop is inserted into the ATP-binding site and directly contacts the -phosphate of ADPnP (Figure 2a). Lys-307 becomes disordered in the LN40­ADP complex, which lacks the -phosphate (Figure 2b). The conserved L1, ATP-lid, and L3 loops are essential for both ATP binding and LN40 dimer formation. The L2 loop is the only conserved region in the MutL family that is not directly associated with nucleotide binding but instead contributes prominently to the dimer interface. The LN40­ADP complex is a monomer in solution (Ban and Yang, 1998a). Interestingly, its crystal structure is dimeric and quite similar to that of LN40­ADPnP. Close examination of the structural difference between the two complexes reveals possible "triggers," which may account for dissociation of the LN40­ADP crystal dimer in solution. The L3 loop, which is anchored to the -phosphate of ADPnP by the conserved Lys-307, is disordered in the absence of the -phosphate (Figure 4a). The ATP lid, although traceable in the electron density map, becomes more mobile as indicated by higher B values (Figure 4b). Even though the LN40­ADP complex is sustained as a dimer by lattice contacts, the dimer is less stable as reflected in the higher average temperature factors than those of the LN40­ADPnP complex (Figure 4b). In particular, the second domain, which is neither fixed by lattice contacts nor by the dimer interface, is rather mobile. The L3 loop and the ATP lid are thus proposed to sense the hydrolysis of -phosphate and trigger the transition of the LN40­ADP complex from dimer to monomer.

Residues 304­308 are completely disordered in the LN40­ADP complex and have no B value assigned.

ATP Binding The ATP-binding site of MutL is composed of constant and variable parts. The constant part is well ordered even in the absence of nucleotide (Ban and Yang, 1998a) and comprises three of the four sequence motifs (I, II, and IV) conserved in the GHL ATPase superfamily. These three conserved motifs fold into the same structural elements in the GHL superfamily (helix A, strands 2 and 6 and the loop following strand 2 in MutL) and make up the adenine-binding pocket regardless of ligands and crystal environment (Ban and Yang, 1998a). The variable part, which consists of the ATP lid and the L3 loop, becomes ordered upon nucleotide binding. The ATP lid contains motif III (residues 91­100) common in the GHL superfamily and 20 residues preceding it that are conserved only in the MutL family. Motif III undergoes dramatic conformational changes upon ligand binding converting from an helix ( D) to an extended phosphate-binding loop (the P loop). Arg-95 in motif III, which occupied the adenine pocket in the absence of nucleotide (Ban and Yang, 1998a), moves out of this pocket and closer to the -phosphate of ADPnP (Figure 5). Mutation of Arg-95 to Phe increases MutL affinity for nucleotide by 2- to 3-fold (Table 2), presumably by dislodging the side chain from the adenine-binding pocket. All atoms of ADPnP are well ordered in the complex with LN40, and ADPnP and the surrounding protein elements have the lowest temperature factors in the LN40­ ADPnP structure. The adenine is hydrogen bonded to residues in motifs I, II, and IV either directly or mediated by water molecules (Figure 5). These protein­adenine interactions, in particular the hydrogen bond between Asp-58 and the N6-amine of adenine, preclude GTP from binding to MutL (data not shown). The side chain of Ile-3 from a neighboring subunit, a conserved aliphatic residue in the MutL family, has close contacts with the ° ribose ring and is only 3.2 A from the 2 -hydroxyl of ADPnP. Such close contact seems unfavorable; however, an Ile residue (Ile-10) is also found at a similar position in the ADPnP­NgyrB structure (Wigley et al.,

1991). The ribose moiety of the ADPnP is stabilized by bifurcated hydrogen bonds donated by Ser-78 (Figure 5). Adenine 3 -deoxyribose triphosphate (dATP) also binds to MutL but is hydrolyzed at a slower rate (data not shown), indicating that Ser-78 is not sufficient to discriminate 3 -deoxyribose. The triphosphate moiety of ADPnP is bound to MutL by numerous direct interactions as well as by interactions mediated by a well-ordered Mg2 ion. The side chains of Thr-77 and Lys-79 donate hydrogen bonds to the -phosphate. The - and -phosphates are surrounded by the P loop. Every peptide nitrogen atom on the P loop donates a hydrogen bond to an oxygen atom of a phosphate (Figure 5). The P loop, rich in glycine and flexible in structure, is buttressed by hydrogen bonds between the guanidinium group of the conserved Arg261 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of the P loop. When Arg-261 is mutated to His, MutL affinity for ATP is greatly reduced (Table 2). In addition, an octahedrally coordinated Mg2 ion links all phosphates to the protein. Each phosphate provides an oxygen to chelate the Mg2 ion, which is unusual, but the same coordination has been observed in the structure of the NgyrB­ ADPnP complex (Wigley et al., 1991). The carboxyl oxygen of Asn-33 and two water molecules complete the octahedral coordination of the Mg2 (Figure 5). In the LN40­ ADP complex, a water molecule replaces the missing oxygen ligand from the -phosphate to coordinate the Mg2 . The intimate interactions of Mg2 with the bound nucleotide and protein suggest that ATP binding could not take place without Mg2 , and indeed this is the case (Experimental Procedures). Dimer Formation The dimer interface of LN40 is composed entirely of the flexible loops that become ordered in the presence of ADPnP. These loops are also characterized by sequence conservation within the MutL family but not in the GHL ATPase superfamily. Loops L1, L2, and L45 of one subunit are paired with L3 and the ATP lid of the other

(Figure 3d). This interface is repeated due to the twofold symmetry in the dimer (Figure 3c). Each monomer ° provides over 60 residues and buries 2400 A2 surface area at the dimer interface. The LN40 dimer interface is formed around a hydrophobic core assembled between helix A of the L1 loop from one subunit and helix C of the ATP lid from the other (Figure 3d). A number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges give rise to the exact register of the interface (Figure 3d). Residues 1­8 of L1 are exchanged between the two subunits in the LN40­ADPnP dimer and reinforce the extended portion of the ATP lid through hydrogen bonds between the main chain atoms (Figure 3). In addition to the main chain hydrogen bonds, Arg-95 and Glu18 make a pair of salt bridges across the dimer interface and further stabilize the L1 and ATP lid interaction. Arg157 on the L2 loop and Asn-302 on the L3 loop interact with each other across the dimer interface, and both donate hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of the L1 loop, thus interlacing the L1, L2, and L3 loops between the two subunits (Figure 3d). Glu-18, Arg-95, Arg157, and Asn-302 are absolutely conserved in the MutL family. The L2 and L45 loops are on the periphery of the dimer interface. L2 interacts with the L1 loop within the same subunit and makes a number of intersubunit van der Waals contacts to the L3 loop and ATP lid (Figure 3d). L45 interacts with the L1 loop of the same subunit through a main chain hydrogen bond and several van der Waals contacts. Two L45 loops juxtaposed from both subunits on top of the LN40­ADPnP complex create a new exposed area in the LN40­ADPnP dimer (Figure 3c). The L2 and L45 loops have no direct contacts

with the bound nucleotide and are likely to become ordered only after ordering of the other three loops that are more directly involved in nucleotide binding. ATP Hydrolysis In the LN40­ADPnP complex, a water molecule (O430) is perfectly aligned for an in-line nucleophilic attack of the -phosphate (Figure 5) and is the only water missing in the ATP-binding site of the LN40­ADP complex. Although the distance between this water molecule and ° the -phosphorus is 4.5 A, somewhat long for the chemistry to take place, this distance may decrease when ATP instead of ADPnP is bound. This water molecule is hydrogen bonded to both Glu-29 and Lys-307. When Glu-29 of MutL or the equivalent glutamate in DNA gyrase or in Hsp90 is mutated, each protein loses its ATPase activity (Jackson and Maxwell, 1993; Ban and Yang, 1998a; Obermann et al., 1998; Panaretou et al., 1998). Therefore, Glu-29 is concluded to serve as a general base for ATP hydrolysis. Lys-307 probably orients the nucleophile. The E29A MutL mutant also has a much lower affinity for ATP (Table 2), probably due to the role of Glu-29 in Mg2 coordination by hydrogen bonding to a ligand water molecule (Figure 5). Lys-307, in addition to interacting with the nucleophilic water molecule, interacts directly with the -phosphate and stabilizes the L3 loop and thus the dimer interface (Figures 2a, 3, and 5). Mutation of an equivalent lysine residue in NgyrB (K337Q) abolished ATPase activity without reducing ATP binding; thus, Lys-337 has been proposed to stabilize the transition state in DNA gyrase during ATP hydrolysis (Smith and Maxwell, 1998).

By analogy, one would expect Lys-307 to be indispensable for both ATP binding and hydrolysis by MutL. Interestingly, when Lys-307 is mutated to Ala, MutL shows reduced but not abolished ATP binding and hydrolysis (Table 2). The role of Lys-307 may be merely to provide positive potential. The nearby Arg-95 (Figure 5), which is unique in the MutL family, may replace the missing positive charge in the K307A mutant and partially sustain the ATPase activity. While R95F MutL mutant is quite active, MutL with double mutations of both R95F and K307A is completely inactive (Table 2). A cascade of steps must take place sequentially when MutL binds and hydrolyzes ATP. Studies of several MutL mutants, which exhibit blocks at various steps in the ATP binding and hydrolysis process, reveal the sequence of events. Conceptually, ATP binding must precede hydrolysis, and the R261H mutant that shows greatly reduced ATP binding has little ATPase activity (Table 2). Studies of two additional MutL mutants reveal the significance of interactions between the N-terminal regions (LN40) in ATP hydrolysis. Mutation of Asn-302 to Ala, a residue distant from the ATP-binding site but essential for the LN40 dimer formation, results in a mutant MutL that binds ATP well but hydrolyzes poorly (Table 2). Arg-95 blocks the adenine pocket in the absence of ligand but reinforces the dimer interface in the LN40­ADPnP complex by hydrogen bonding to Glu-18 of a neighboring subunit. The R95F mutant displays increased ATP binding and decreased ATP hydrolysis (Table 2). Therefore, each subunit can bind ATP independently, but association of the N-terminal region appears to be required for ATP hydrolysis. A filter binding assay using - and -32P-labeled ATP that allows quantitation of the amounts of ATP and ADP bound to MutL was employed to study the dynamics of nucleotide­protein interaction and the rate-limiting step of ATP hydrolysis (see Experimental Procedures). At the steady state, 50% of MutL is associated with nucleotide, 80% of which is ATP. Even though 20% of the

accumulated protein­nucleotide complexes are with ADP, no product inhibition is detected (see Experimental Procedures). Results from size exclusion chromatography indicate that the nucleotide-associated MutL at the steady state is dissociated in the N-terminal region. Even when 1 mM ATP is included in the gel filtration buffer, the elution profiles of the MutL­ATP complex remain the same as nucleotide-free protein (data not shown). Association of the N-terminal regions of MutL requires the ordering of over 120 residues and could be very slow. Thus, the rate-limiting step of ATP hydrolysis by MutL is concluded to be a transformation from nucleotide bound but inactive to a catalytically active protein­ ATP complex, which occurs upon association of the N-terminal region of MutL or dimerization of LN40. It is not surprising that intact MutL hydrolyzes ATP ten times faster than the LN40 fragment, since the association of the N-terminal region in MutL can take place more readily in the MutL dimer. A model for the progression of the ATPase activity and protein structural transformation is summarized under Table 2. Comparison of MutL with DNA Gyrase and Hsp90 A similar progression of ATP binding, dimerization, and hydrolysis has been proposed for both DNA gyrase and yeast topoisomerase II (Roca and Wang, 1992; Ali et al., 1995). Comparison of the structures of NgyrB and LN40 complexed with ADPnP reveals many striking similarities. The ATP-binding site, including all known catalytic residues, is strictly conserved. Following superposition of a single ATP-binding site, the relative orientation of the two subunits is identical in the LN40­ADPnP and NgyrB­ADPnP complexes (Figures 3c and 6a). It is impossible to predict such structural similarity based on less than 15% sequence identity (Ban and Yang, 1998a). Detailed structural comparison also reveals significant differences between LN40 and NgyrB dimers. Although the dimeric arrangement of LN40­ADPnP and NgyrB­ADPnP are nearly identical, the dimer interfaces

are formed rather differently. The NgyrB dimer interface is much smaller than that of MutL and is composed of only two flexible loops (L1 and L3) and an additional pair of helices at the C terminus (Figure 6a). The fact that fewer residues need to be ordered in NgyrB may partially explain the higher rate of ATP hydrolysis by DNA gyrase than by MutL (Tamura et al., 1992). Residues preceding Motif III in the ATP lid share little sequence similarity between NgyrB and MutL and assume different conformations in these proteins. The ATP lid of NgyrB completely encloses the bound ADPnP molecule (Figure 6a); the ATP lid of LN40 participates in the dimer interface and leaves the adenine partially exposed to solvent (Figure 3c). Structural differences in the ATP lid probably underlie different susceptibilities of the two proteins to inhibitors. For example, the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase is inhibited by ADP (Ali et al., 1995), while ATP hydrolysis by MutL is unaffected by additions of ADP up to a concentration equal to ATP (see Experimental Procedures). MutL is also found to be much less sensitive to novobiocin, a competitive inhibitor of the gyrase ATPase (Lewis et al., 1996; Ban and Yang, 1998a). The net results of these differences are that DNA gyrase hydrolyses ATP 100 times faster than MutL and the rate limiting step is product release instead of formation of the prehydrolysis complex as in MutL. Multiple crystal structures of an ATP-binding domain of Hsp90 have been reported (Prodromou et al., 1997; Stebbins et al., 1997; Obermann et al., 1998). The N-terminal strand and helix that are common in the intersubunit interactions in both LN40 and NgyrB are present in all of the Hsp90 structures, but they form intrasubunit contacts instead (Figure 6b). The structural

mobility exhibited by these regions in different crystal forms and their remarkable sequence conservation in the Hsp90 family (Stebbins et al., 1997), however, suggest that the N-terminal strand may be exchanged between subunits and Hsp90 dimerizes as observed in LN40 and NgyrB upon nucleotide binding. In addition, contrary to the observation that ADP is an effective inhibitor of Hsp90 (Panaretou et al., 1998), the ATP lid in the crystal structures of the Hsp90 fragment­ATP complexes (Prodromou et al., 1997; Obermann et al., 1998) leaves the bound nucleotide most exposed to solvent compared with NgyrB and LN40 (Figures 3c and 6). While it is possible that the nucleotide is enclosed by other parts than the ATP lid in the intact Hsp90, variable conformations of the ATP lid observed in the crystal structures (Stebbins et al., 1997; Obermann et al., 1998) suggest the possibility that an intact Hsp90­ nucleotide complex may have similar structural features to those of NgyrB and LN40. Stimulation of the MutL ATPase Activity by DNA Conformational changes associated with nucleosidetriphosphate binding and hydrolysis serve many purposes, such as signal transduction, refolding of macromolecules, inter- and intracellular transportation, and movement ranging from within a cell to a human body. Vastly different kinetic characteristics are often exploited in different systems. For example, fast hydrolysis rates in motor proteins support rapid locomotion, and slow but highly regulated nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange in G proteins are essential for signaling (Vale, 1996). Members of the GHL superfamily possess highly variable ATP hydrolysis characteristics and perform

Cell 94

vastly different biological functions. MutL and Hsp90 display extremely low ATPase activities, while the rate of ATP hydrolysis by type II DNA topoisomerases is 60 min 1 (Berger and Wang, 1996). Hsp90 is a protein chaperone, although the full range of its function is still under investigation. Type II DNA topoisomerases generate supercoils in double-stranded DNA and utilize ATP to facilitate this reaction. Under optimal conditions, 2 ATP molecules are hydrolyzed for each supercoil (Berger and Wang, 1996). The crystal structure of the NgyrB­ADPnP complex represents the "gate-closed" form with a central hole proposed to capture dsDNA (Figure 6a). Mutation of an arginine residue that extends into this hole abolishes DNA supercoiling by gyrase (Tingey and Maxwell, 1996). The two subunits of NgyrB dissociate in the absence of nucleotide, so that the gate for DNA entrance becomes open (Wigley et al., 1991). Similar conformational changes associated with ATPase activity also occur in DNA topoisomerase II and have been characterized as mechanically opening and closing a gate to allow multiple rounds of DNA passage and consequent supercoiling. In the LN40­ADPnP complex, a deep saddle-shaped ° ° groove 15 A wide and 28 A deep is formed between two protein subunits, mainly between the second domains as observed in NgyrB (Figures 3c and 6a). The surface potential of this groove is highly positive, making it a prime candidate for DNA binding (Figure 7b). The C-terminal region in MutL, which is absent in the crystal structure, would seal and convert this groove to a hole as in DNA gyrase. Although the dimensions of the groove are too narrow for B-form dsDNA to bind, ssDNA can be accommodated easily. Binding of MutL to DNA and a preference for ssDNA were elegantly shown by Bende and Grafstrom (1991) despite negative results of others ¨ (Drotschmann et al., 1998). A double-filter binding assay confirms that MutL binds DNA, preferably ssDNA (Figure 7d and Experimental Procedures). ATP seems to have no effect on DNA binding by MutL (Figure 7d), probably because the DNA-binding surface also exists in the apoprotein and the N-terminal dissociated MutL structures. ADPnP, which dimerizes the N-terminal region and locally doubles the DNA-binding surface of MutL, enhances the interaction between MutL and ssDNA (Figure 7d). The fact that the MutL ATPase activity is stimulated 3-fold by dsDNA and 7-fold by ssDNA is further evidence for interaction between MutL and DNA (Figure 7e). The specificity of such stimulation by DNA is confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of Arg266 to Glu in the putative DNA-binding groove abolishes DNA binding by MutL (Figure 7d). The R266E mutant has normal ATPase activity but fails to respond to DNA stimulation (Figure 7e). Although Arg-266 and most of the residues in this DNA-binding groove are not conserved in the MutL family, model building indicates that positive potential in this region is conserved in the human MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer. Loss of a positively charged side chain is often accompanied by a compensatory substitution nearby. Thus, stimulation of the ATPase activity by DNA is probably conserved in the eukaryotic MutL homologs. A Switch Mechanism of MutL in DNA Mismatch Repair The structural similarity between MutL and NgyrB and their parallel response to DNA stimulation suggest that

Figure 8. Mutations of hMLH1 Found in the HNPCC Kindred Fourteen hMLH1 mutations are mapped onto the MutL structure based on the sequence homology. Protein is shown in green ribbon diagram and ATP moiety in light yellow sticks. The original side chains of MutL are shown in ball and stick and labeled in blue. Mutations of hMLH1 that would affect ATPase activity are labeled in red, and others are labeled in magenta.

MutL family members may function as a ssDNA clamp gated by ATP. However, the slow kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and complicated functional requirement of MutL in DNA repair argue against it being a simple mechanical DNA clamp. The presence of ssDNA increases the Km and kcat of the MutL ATPase activity by 3- and 7-fold, respectively (Table 2). ssDNA effectively stabilizes the nucleotide-free form of MutL by reducing the affinity for ATP and accelerating the rate of ATP hydrolysis of MutL. Considering the effects on both kcat and the Km of MutL, which is close to the in vivo ATP concentration, ssDNA can redistribute MutL between nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound forms in cells. The crystal structures of LN40 and LN40­ADPnP present two dramatically different molecular states. In the LN40­ADPnP complex, two potential interfaces are formed in addition to the DNA-binding groove. A large crevice that runs along the length of LN40 is formed near the bound adenine in each subunit (Figure 7a). The shape of the crevice is complementary to a convex surface of MutH that has been proposed to interact with MutL (Ban and Yang, 1998b). Since this crevice is distant from the dimer interface, its formation should depend on nucleotide binding only, which fits well with the observation that activation of MutH by MutL depends on ATP binding but not hydrolysis (Ban and Yang, 1998a). Confirmation of the involvement of this crevice in MutH interaction awaits future experiments. Another potential interface is composed mainly of the two L45 loops (Figure 7c). Formation of this surface depends on both nucleotide binding and association of the N-terminal region of MutL. Although the amino acid sequence of the L45

Structures of ADP­ and ADPnP­MutL Complexes 95

loop varies in the MutL family, its length is conserved (Ban and Yang, 1998a). Human homologs of MutL can form a similar interface without changing backbone conformations, but the shape and charge potential of this interface will be different from that of MutL and will be asymmetric in the hMLH1-hPMS2 heterodimer. This area may interact with MutS in E. coli and MSH heterodimers in humans. Interaction between this area and other molecules, regardless of consequences on the interaction partner, would influence the stability of the LN40 dimer and thus activity of the MutL ATPase. In contrast to the LN40­ADPnP complex, the apoprotein structure lacks the above mentioned interfaces. However, it presents several flexible peptides in the N-terminal region, which do not seem to interact specifically with MutL itself (Ban and Yang, 1998a) but may interact with other proteins. These two states of MutL are clearly regulated by ssDNA in vitro and probably in vivo. During DNA mismatch repair, ssDNA exists, for example, after initial incision of dsDNA and removal of nucleotides by exonuclease. Therefore, the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of MutL probably plays a role in switching from a mismatch-repair initiation complex to a processing complex. Molecular Basis for HNPCC Fourteen HNPCC kindreds contain missense mutations in the N-terminal conserved region of hMLH1. Based on the homologous E. coli LN40 structure, these mutants can be divided into two functional classes. Nine out of the 14 mutants are located in the vicinity of the ATPbinding site and probably affect the ATPase activity (Figure 8). For example, the R265H mutation would destabilize the P loop and reduce ATP binding based on the results of an equivalent mutation in MutL, R261H (Table 2). Ile-68 of hMLH1 is equivalent to Ile-63 in MutL, which forms hydrophobic stacking interactions with the adenine base. The I68N mutant would abolish such hydrophobic interactions and reduce ATP binding. P28L, M35R, and S44F are located along helix A and would dislocate the general base Glu-34 on the same helix, thus impeding ATP hydrolysis. G67R, I107R, T117R, and T117M mutations would degrade the ATP-binding site by distorting the native main chain torsion angles and side chain interactions. The remaining five hMLH1 mutants seem likely to alter and destabilize the overall protein folding (Figure 8). For example, V185G on E and V326A on I would either alter helical propensity or leave cavities in hydrophobic cores, respectively; R226L would result in an unfavorably exposed leucine. Gly-244 forms a bulge at the interface between the first and second domain and is conserved throughout the MutL family (Gly-238 in MutL). Mutation of Gly to Asp causes a similar DNA repair defect in both E. coli and humans. The G238D and G238A MutL mutants have been constructed for functional studies. However, both are expressed in an insoluble form, suggesting that they are misfolded. Conclusion The crystal structures of the LN40­nucleotide complexes and biochemical studies presented here have confirmed that MutL is a bona fide ATPase. Analyses of the ATPase activity and associated structural transformations have

provided insights into functions of the MutL family. First, all of the conserved residues in the MutL family, many of which were formerly disordered in the ligand-free structure, are now well ordered, and the basis of their conservation is apparent. Second, kinetic characterization of the MutL ATPase activity coupled with mutatgenesis experiments has illustrated a unique pathway of ATP binding and hydrolysis, which provides a foundation for analyzing the functional roles of MutL. Third, the structural transformation shown between the apoprotein and the nucleotide complexes reveals yet another nucleotide-mediated signaling paradigm. Conformational changes similar to those observed in MutL are likely to occur in the DNA topoisomerase II family and may be a general property of the GHL ATPase superfamily. Finally, the ability of MutL to assume radically different structures and its susceptibility to regulation by DNA strongly suggest that it is a switch important for coordination of events in DNA mismatch repair.
Experimental Procedures Crystallization of LN40­ADPnP and LN40­ADP Complexes The N-terminal 40 kDa fragment of E. coli MutL (LN40) was produced as described (Ban and Yang, 1998a). The LN40­ADPnP complex was made by incubating 1 mg/ml LN40 with 2 mM ADPnP in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.4), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5% glycerol buffer at room temperature for 1 hr and at 4 C overnight. The LN40­ADPnP complex was purified away from excess ADPnP over a Superdex-200 column and concentrated in a centricon to 6 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.4), 1 mM DTT, 1.0 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. Crystals of the complex were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method against a reservoir solution containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 200 mM Li2SO4, 2 mM DTT, and 18% PEG4000 at 20 C. Crystals appeared within a day and grew to a maximal dimension of 0.2 0.2 0.3 mm in a week. The LN40­ADP complex was prepared using the same procedure except that ATP replaced ADPnP. The LN40­ATP complex remained soluble at 6 mg/ml with a slightly higher concentration of KCl, 200 mM instead of 150 mM. Crystals of the complex were grown against a reservoir solution of 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 400 mM Li2SO4, 2 mM DTT, and 28% PEG5000-MME. Nucleation took 9­10 days, and crystals reached the final size of 0.2 0.2 0.3 mm in 2 weeks. A single LN40­nucleotide crystal was quickly transferred to a cryo-solvent, which contains mother liquor and 10% ethylene glycol, and flash frozen in a cold N2 stream. Diffraction data were collected at 98 K using a RAXIS-II detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 generator and processed with the HKL program suit (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Structure Determination A search model with the two domains of the LN40 apoprotein structure separated at residue 200 was used for molecular replacement (MR) solution for the LN40­ADPnP structure because relative rotation between them was expected upon nucleotide binding. Using AMoRe, the rotation function solution was found for each domain independently. The translation function was solved for the first domain and then for the second after fixing the first domain. Maps calculated after refinement of the MR solution using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) failed to show the regions that were not in the search ¨ model. An interpretable electron density map was obtained only by using the maximum-likelihood method for refinement and map calculation implemented in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). In addition ¨ to the complete trace of residues 1­331 of MutL, two of the three residues appended to the N terminus from the expression vector (Ban and Yang, 1998a) are also well ordered. Both LN40­ADPnP and LN40­ADP structures have been refined to the statistics shown in Table 1. Ninety percent of residues in the LN40­ADPnP complex are in the most favored region in the Ramachandran plot, and the rest are in the additionally allowed region. The structure of the LN40­ ADP complex has similarly good statistics.

Mutants of MutL MutL mutants E29A (pWY1066), R95F (pWY1070), R261H(pWY1075), N302A (pWY1067), K307A (pWY1074), R95F/K307A (pWY1048), and R266E (pWY1069) were derived from plasmid pTX418 (Feng and Winkler, 1995) using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The C-terminal His-tagged MutL was generated using PCR primers coding for an authentic N-terminal sequence and 6 His at the C terminus, and the PCR product was cloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET3a. Sequences of all MutL mutants were verified using DNA sequencer PRISM-310 (ABI). All MutL mutants were purified as described (Ban and Yang, 1998a).

ATPase Activity Assay ATPase activity was assayed in 15 l reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 90 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5 mM MgCl2. Reactions were initiated by addition of ATP, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and terminated by addition of an equal volume of 50 mM EDTA. Hydrolysis products were detected using TLC plates as described (Ban and Yang, 1998a). (1) For protein concentration­ dependent ATPase activity assay, 0.25 to 20 M LN40 or MutL and 0.4 mM -labeled 32P-ATP were used. (2) The ATPase activity of MutL mutants was assayed using 1 M protein and 0.025 to 1 mM - or -labeled 32P-ATP. (3) The effect of DNA on the ATPase activity was assayed using 1 M protein, 3 M 72 bp dsDNA or 110 nt ssDNA, and 0.025­1 mM -labeled 32P-ATP. (4) Product inhibition was tested over a 2 hr time course for declining of ATP hydrolysis rate. Catalytic rate was also monitored in the reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM ADP and 0.1 mM ATP and was found to be the same as in the absence of ADP.

Double-Filter Binding Assay Binding of MutL to nucleotide or DNA was analyzed using a doublefilter binding assay (Wong and Lohman, 1993; Pata et al., 1995). Nitrocellulose (BA-85, Schleicher and Schuell) was used to retain all proteins, including free, nucleotide-, and DNA-associated proteins; Hybond-N nylon (Amershan) was used to retain free DNA. Nucleotide and DNA binding assays were performed in the same reaction buffer as ATP hydrolysis. Filter papers were presoaked in the reaction buffer for 1 hr and stacked onto an unmodified 96-well dot blot apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell) in the order of gel blot paper GB002 (Schleicher and Schuell), Hybond-N nylon, and nitrocellulose. Protein binding capacity of the nitrocellulose membrane was found to be 4 g MutL per well and was not exceeded in any experiment. Binding of free ATP or DNA to nitrocellulose was negligible. Aliquots of 25 l reaction mix were added to individual wells. After samples were drawn through the membranes by vacuum, 100 l of the reaction buffer was added to wash wells containing samples. The nitrocellulose and Hybond-N membranes were removed and air dried, and 32P-labeled nucleotide and DNA were quantified using the phosphor imager system. For the steady-state kinetics, 1 M MutL was incubated with 0.1 mM - and -labeled 32P-ATP in parallel at room temperature, and samples were withdrawn and applied to the blotting apparatus at various time points from 2 to 80 min. The steady state was reached in 10 min. The amount of -labeled ATP detected on the nitrocellulose membrane represented both substrate ATP and product ADP associated with MutL; the -labeled ATP represented only the substrate ATP. Binding of MutL or MutL mutants to nucleotide was assayed after incubating 1 M protein with 0.1 mM -labeled ATP for 20 min. The effect of Mg2 was measured by replacing Mg2 with 1 mM EDTA, which abolished MutL­ATP association completely. In the protein­DNA binding assay, 0.1 M protein was incubated with 0.025­5 M end-labeled homoduplex OE-72 (Ban and Yang, 1998a) or ssDNA of 110 nt for 30 min, and the reaction mixtures were applied to the blotting apparatus. Both protein-bound and free DNA were quantified. The amount of DNA associated with protein increased linearly with the increase of the total DNA. MutL was halfsaturated with ssDNA at 4 M DNA concentration. The effect of ATP and ADPnP on interaction between MutL and DNA was measured by addition of 0.4 mM ATP or ADPnP.
