Halorhodopsin: light-driven ion pumping made simple? Lars-Oliver Essen
Halorhodopsin, a light-driven halide pump, is the second archaeal rhodopsin involved in ion pumping to be studied at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. Like its cousin bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin couples vectorial ion transport to the isomerisation state of a covalently linked retinal. Given the similarity and interconvertability of these two ion pumps, a unified mechanism for ion translocation by archaeal rhodopsins is now emerging.

H. salinarum [11,12,13·]. Tetragonal 2D crystals formed spontaneously in vivo when halorhodopsin was homologously overproduced in the recombinant H. salinarum strain D2. Unlike the naturally occurring 2D crystals of bacteriorhodopsin, which constitute the so-called purple membrane, the alternating inside-out and outside-in arrangement of halorhodopsin tetramers suggested that these 2D crystals were physiologically irrelevant artefacts of the overexpression conditions. Nevertheless, low-resolution data of up to 5 Å resolution proved the bacteriorhodopsinlike architecture of halorhodopsin. The 1.8 Å X-ray structure of H. salinarum halorhodopsin [10··] was the second structure of a membrane protein to be crystallised in a lipidic cubic phase [14,15·]. In these 3D crystals, halorhodopsin assembled into trimers and the crystal packing resembled the purple membrane organisation of trimeric bacteriorhodopsin (Figure 1). Despite this coincidence, the quaternary structure is not conserved because the monomers in the halorhodopsin trimer are tilted by 11° relative to the monomers in the bacteriorhodopsin trimer [10··]. Why does halorhodopsin crystallise as either a tetramer or a trimer, even though the protein used for the 2D and 3D crystallisations was isolated from the same H. salinarum strain? The X-ray structure shows that the halorhodopsin trimer included a lipidic plug consisting of the fatty acid palmitate (Figure 2). This surprising association of halorhodopsin with palmitate was first shown by Corcelli et al. [16], who also confirmed its noncovalent mode of binding [17]. Previously, similar specific binding of a lipid was demonstrated for trimeric bacteriorhodopsin, which encircled a patch of the haloarchaeal glycolipid S-TGA-1 [18]. However, the binding of palmitate by halorhodopsin and its physiological role are rather enigmatic, because pathways for the biosynthesis of palmitate and other unbranched fatty acids are likely to be missing in haloarchaea. Because of their chemoorganotrophic lifestyle and the ubiquitous presence of palmitate, haloarchaea probably take up these fatty acids, as they do other nutrients, from the environment. The genome sequence of H. salinarum strain NRC-1 [19·] corroborated this notion, as the genome comprised several genes usually occurring in the -oxidation pathway of fatty acids. The evidence that palmitate affects the function of halorhodopsin is only indirect; upon removal of palmitate, changes were noted for the photocycle kinetics and the pKa of the protonated Schiff base, at which the retinal is linked to the protein moiety [16]. Palmitate might modulate halide pumping by H. salinarum halorhodopsin analogously to the archaeal lipids that modify the cooperativity of proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin. This could be

Introduction
Two functions can be assigned to the protein family of archaeal rhodopsins [1]: signalling by photoreception, as exemplified by sensory rhodopsins (reviewed by Spudich and Luecke; this issue, pp 540­546); and light-driven ion pumping through lipid bilayers, as catalysed by bacteriorhodopsins and halorhodopsins. A plethora of studies on these heptahelical membrane proteins has focused on the following issues [1­3]: how is photoisomerisation and reisomerisation of a covalently bound retinal chromophore coupled to unidirectional ion or signal transport; what conformational changes in the protein moiety accompany the photocycle; and, finally, is there a common mechanism rationalising the different functions? Because of its stability and abundance in haloarchaea, the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin was until recently the favourite subject for biophysical and structural studies, which culminated in a series of X-ray crystallographic snapshots of photocycle intermediates (reviewed in [4·]). Halorhodopsins were discovered and coined in 1980 [5], and, shortly afterwards, recognised as inwardly directed Cl­ pumps [6]. The ion specificity and directionality were surprising, as halorhodopsins share significant sequence identities of 25­35% with bacteriorhodopsins [7]. Many subsequent studies on the halorhodopsins of Halobacterium salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis addressed the binding and transport of Cl­, other halides and nitrate, and their influence on photocycle kinetics, the chromophore and the primary photoreaction (for in-depth reviews, see [8,9]). Here, I examine what the recently determined X-ray structure of halorhodopsin [10··] implies, together with other biophysical data, regarding a common mechanism for ion translocation by halorhodopsins and bacteriorhodopsins.

feasible, because the X-ray structure [10··] shows that the protonated Schiff base and the Cl­ next to it are 11 and 7 Å from the carboxylate of palmitate, respectively [10··]. Furthermore, halorhodopsin trimers in the native cell membrane were implied by hexagonal 2D crystals, which were observed in the membranes of H. salinarum strain D2 by electron microscopy [20].

the transport site, involve a highly conserved way of local helix softening. In contrast to other archaeal rhodopsins, the extracellular BC loop of halorhodopsin is longer and covers most of the extracellular surface. Enhanced conformational flexibility of this loop was confirmed by atomic force microscopy on tetragonal 2D crystals [23·]. Whether this flexibility plays a role during the photocycle is not known. However, mutation of H95 at the tip of the BC loop caused a significant decrease in pumping activity, as well as some general destabilisation [24].

Local softening of  helices: common `mechanics' for archaeal rhodopsins?
The heptahelical transmembrane region is highly conserved among ion- and signal-translocating rhodopsins. Distortions from the regular -helical pattern occur only at regions that are thought to undergo conformational changes during the photocycle. The -helical segment V239­F245 in helix G (bacteriorhodopsin/sensory rhodopsin II: V213­F219/L202­F208) comprises the conserved lysine residue to which retinal is bound as a protonated Schiff base (K242). In bacteriorhodopsin, photoisomerisation of retinal triggers the reorientation of the peptide planes preceding and following this lysine [21]. Likewise, the -helical segment A178­W183 (bacteriorhodopsin/sensory rhodopsin II: V151­F156/Y140­M145) at the cytosolic end of helix E presumably acts as a hinge, supporting the swivel motions of the cytosolic part of helix F during the formation of late photocycle intermediates [22]. From this, one might conclude that the mechanics of large-scale conformational changes, such as the tilting of helix F or changes of the hydrogen-bonding patterns near

How many chloride-binding sites?
Much confusion arose about the precise number and definition of Cl­-binding sites in halorhodopsins, as previously determined by spectroscopic and kinetic studies. The X-ray structure of unphotolysed halorhodopsin [10··] defined only one site, the transport site (Figure 3). Its affinity is about 10 mM and 2.5 mM for halorhodopsins from H. salinarum and N. pharaonis [25·], respectively. In the X-ray structure, the Cl­ is only 3.8 Å from the protonated Schiff base [10··], indicating a strong electrostatic interaction, as extrapolated previously from FT-IR data [26,27] and changes in the visible spectrum upon halide binding [28·,29]. Other features of the transport site were not predicted. Firstly, for geometrical reasons, the location of Cl­ in the transport site was incompatible with a strong hydrogen

the cytosol in the unphotolysed state [10··]. Here, the light-triggered movement of Cl­ into this cytoplasmic release site was postulated to trigger conformational changes in the cytoplasmic half that are akin to conformational changes seen in bacteriorhodopsin [22] for establishing free exchange with the cytosolic surface. In N. pharaonis halorhodopsin, the transport site lowered its Cl­ affinity from 2.5 mM to 1.1 M after photoexcitation [25·], whereas the affinity of the cytoplasmic release site was mostly unchanged (5.7 M; [33]). Furthermore, the transport activity of halorhodopsin is inhibited by high concentrations of Cl­ or other halides [25·,33]. Interestingly, Okuno et al. [33] suggested a third Cl­-binding site, on the extracellular surface, that was not observed in the current X-ray structure and other kinetic studies [27].

bond towards the Schiff base nitrogen. Secondly, the anion was still partially hydrated by a cluster of three water molecules and forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl of the conserved serine S115. Although R108 is essential for pumping activity [30], direct binding of its guanidinium group to Cl­ [26] was ruled out because of intervening water molecules. Thirdly, a cluster of aliphatic hydrogens around the Cl­ appeared to contribute significantly to halide binding [10··]. Lastly, the only -helical distortion unique to halorhodopsin comprises the 310-like helical segment L110­A113. This stretch includes T111, which is the corresponding residue of the primary proton acceptor in bacteriorhodopsin, D85. However, relative to the latter residue in bacteriorhodopsin, T111 is pulled 1.8 Å out of the Cl­-occupied transport site of halorhodopsin due to the helical distortion. The additional space provided to the Cl­ might become lost upon Cl­ translocation, when T111 moves back into the transport site, with concomitant restoration of the -helical hydrogen-bonding pattern. Interestingly, the hydroxyl of T111 is superfluous for Cl­ binding, as shown by the 3D structure and activity studies of the T111V mutant [31]. Only retardation of Cl­ reuptake was found for the T111V mutant, the structural basis of which is not clear [31]. According to stopped-flow experiments on N. pharaonis halorhodopsin, Cl­ uptake itself is mostly ruled by passive diffusion through an extracellular pathway during later stages of the photocycle [32·]. The X-ray structure suggested a second, transient halidebinding site that borders the cytoplasmic side of the Schiff base (Figure 3), but is completely occluded from access to

How might the existence of at least two halide-binding sites in halorhodopsin correlate with its halide-dependent photocycle? Subnanosecond formation of the K state (max  600 nm) upon illumination of the unphotolysed HR state (max  580 nm) is accompanied by photoisomerisation of the retinal from all-trans to 13-cis, 15-anti, and by a flip of the N­H dipole of the protonated Schiff base (Figure 4). Evidence for such a dipole flip comes from small negative electrogenic charge shifts upon K formation, as observed in halorhodopsin [34] and other archaeal rhodopsins. Apparently, the majority of the 23.2 kcal/mol still left in the K intermediate after photoexcitation [35] is stored in a twisted chromophore conformation, as the X-ray structures of K-like intermediates of bacteriorhodopsin and sensory rhodopsin [36,37] revealed only minor conformational changes in the protein moiety. The transition to an L state (max  520 nm) is reversible (GKL  ­1.8 kcal/mol; [35]) and presumably reflects the movement of the halide from its transport site to the cytoplasmic release site [10··,27]. Time-resolved FT-IR data [27] suggested that the transport preference for Br­ over Cl­ derives from the tighter binding of Br­ to the cytoplasmic release site. In structural terms, this translocation event might be some form of `ion dragging', whereby the Cl­ follows the flipped dipole of the N­H Schiff base bond [10··] and forms a strong hydrogen bond with the protonated Schiff base [26]. The opening of an extracellular pathway from the cytoplasmic release site towards the protein surface was attributed either to an L2O transition [38·] or to a spectroscopically silent transition between two L-like intermediates, L1 and L2 ([25·,34,39]; Figure 4). The precise order of the late photocycle events is still ambiguous and differs between halorhodopsins from H. salinarum and N. pharaonis. For example, in the former, an O state (max  600 nm) is not detectable, presumably for kinetic reasons [40], although such a bathochromically shifted O intermediate should correspond to halorhodopsin after Cl­ release and reisomerisation of the chromophore. Cl­ release towards the cytosol was previously assigned to

the NO transition [34,41], but a careful kinetic analysis of the photocycle of N. pharaonis halorhodopsin [25·] placed the N state (max  520 nm) after O state decay. In this analysis, Cl­ release and thermal reisomerisation were suggested to occur during an L2O1 transition (Figure 4). After closure of the cytosolic pathway (O1O2), reuptake of Cl­ into the transport site would proceed during the O2N transition [25·], instead of during the OHR transition, which was postulated to precede a spectroscopically silent restoration of the unphotolysed HR state [41]. Obviously, more structural data for late photocycle intermediates are needed to get reliable correlations between spectroscopic states and transport states.

only be related to the transport site. For example, in the D85T mutant, Cl­ translocation induces a transient deprotonation of E204 [45], a residue that is part of an extracellular proton-release group. Such a compensatory proton release is not required in halorhodopsins, as the corresponding residue is replaced by a neutral threonine (T230). Second-site mutations in the extracellular half of the D85T mutant showed a similar important role for T178 in Cl­ translocation towards the cytoplasmic side as T203 in halorhodopsin [44·]. Apart from this residue, which is predicted to line the cytoplasmic release site for Cl­, no other residues that are crucial to halide transport were identified in the cytoplasmic half of either halorhodopsin [31] or the bacteriorhodopsin D85T mutant [44·]. Consequently, the walling of the cytosolic exit pathway for Cl­ can be rather unspecific and may be compatible with the passive diffusion of Cl­ into the cytosol [32·]. Interestingly, halorhodopsin can be converted to an outwardly directed proton pump by replacing Cl­ in the transport site by the pseudohalide azide [46·,47­49]. The azide anion acts as a proton acceptor in much the same way as D85 in bacteriorhodopsin and shuttles protons along the cytoplasmic pathway between the protein surface and the Schiff base [48]. Given these interconvertabilities among ion-pumping rhodopsins, what is the essence of unidirectional proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin? In bacteriorhodopsin,

A common mechanism for ion transport by archaeal rhodopsins?
What is the essence of halorhodopsin being a Cl­ pump? A single-site mutation in bacteriorhodopsin, D85S or D85T, converted it from a proton pump to a Cl­ pump [42]. The photocycles of halorhodopsin and this bacteriorhodopsin D85T mutant resembled each other, but bacteriorhodopsin D85T exhibited a 10-fold lower transport efficiency and a 20-fold lower affinity for Cl­ [43,44·] than halorhodopsin. Furthermore, the photocycle of the D85T mutant comprised a rate-limiting Cl­ uptake step, presumably because access from the extracellular side to the transport site is sterically hindered, whereas Cl­ release was faster than in halorhodopsin [43,44·]. The structural reasons why halorhodopsin is still a better catalyst than D85T bacteriorhodopsin for Cl­ pumping are unclear, but they might not

Current Opinion in Structural Biology

A hypothetical correlation between the photocycle model of Chizhov and Engelhard [25·], and structural substates of halorhodopsin. In H. salinarum halorhodopsin, R108, one of the counterions for bound Cl­, is hereby predicted to undergo conformational changes to allow the free diffusion of Cl­ into the transport site. Upon illumination of the unphotolysed HR state, K state formation is accompanied by photoisomerisation of the retinal and by a flip of the N­H dipole of the

protonated Schiff base (K242). The transition to an L state is reversible and presumably reflects the movement of the halide from its transport site (orange) to the cytoplasmic release site (light blue), which is only transiently accessible to the cytoplasm (L1L2). During the L2O1 transition, Cl­ release and thermal reisomerisation occur. After closure of the cytosolic pathway (O1O2), reuptake of Cl­ into the transport site proceeds during the O2N transition.

proton transfer proceeds during the LM transition from the protonated Schiff base towards D85. Several models have been put forward to rationalise the unidirectionality of

this transfer step (summarised in [50·]): proton transfer between D85 and the protonated Schiff base, which occurs either directly or along a bridging water molecule; changes

in the local bending of the retinal polyene moiety and a proton relay via T89 [22]; and the so-called hydroxide hypothesis. This last hypothesis postulates that a water molecule, at first hydrogen bonded to the Schiff base in the unphotolysed state, is deprotonated by D85 after photoisomerisation of the chromophore. The hydroxide then moves towards the cytoplasmic side of the chromophore, analogously to Cl­ in halorhodopsin, where it regains a proton from the protonated Schiff base [50·]. The net effect would be outward pumping of a proton and inward pumping of a water molecule. This appealing model implies that all ion-translocating archaeal rhodopsins catalyse the passage of an anionic species across the photoisomerised retinal and that the steric and electrostatic properties of the transport site alone determine specificity.

Conclusions
According to such a `canonical' mechanism, the ion selectivity of archaeal rhodopsins is a highly localised feature of the transport site, but not of the cytosolic and extracellular pathways leading to it. This combination of specific gating and unspecific conductance pathways could be a general hallmark of halide-conducting systems, as recently demonstrated for another protein family, the ClC-like Cl­ channels [51]. In contrast to proton pumping by bacterio-rhodopsin, halorhodopsin offers the interesting advantage that movements of halides should be directly observable by the same X-ray crystallographic techniques that proved so useful in the past for bacteriorhodopsin [4·]. Hereby, the structural analysis of mutant halorhodopsins will certainly be instrumental to trap photocycle intermediates with sufficient yields.

Biophys J 2002, 82:1687-1695. The conversion of halorhodopsin into a proton pump by azide gives a bacteriorhodopsin-like photocycle, including a `spectrally silent' transition between two M states. 47.

The authors conclude from time-resolved FT-IR difference spectra that halides are passing from the extracellular side to the cytoplasmic side during the K(L)L transition. The specificities towards different halides are rationalised by the halide dependence of the back reaction, LK(L). 29.

Biophys J 2002, 41:2452-2458. Using recombinant halorhodopsin from N. pharaonis, this report gives some evidence that Cl­ uptake by halorhodopsin occurs by passive diffusion along the extracellular pathway and that Cl­ release occurs during the N decay. The data are also consistent with a single halide-binding site, as revealed previously by the X-ray structure of H. salinarum halorhodopsin. 33.
