Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is hypothesized to lead to an increase in circulating levels of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, resulting in the potentiation of their in vivo pharmacological properties. As part of an effort to identify inhibitors of sEH with high and sustained plasma exposure, we recently performed a high throughput screen of our compound collection. The screen identified N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-nicotinamide as a potent inhibitor of sEH. Further profiling of this lead revealed short metabolic half-lives in microsomes and rapid clearance in the rat. Consistent with these observations, the determination of the in vitro metabolic profile of N-(3,3-diphenyl-propyl)-nicotinamide in rat liver microsomes revealed extensive oxidative metabolism and a propensity for metabolite switching. Lead optimization, guided by the analysis of the solid-state costructure of N-(3,3-diphenyl-propyl)-nicotinamide bound to human sEH, led to the identification of a class of potent and selective inhibitors. An inhibitor from this class displayed an attractive in vitro metabolic profile and high and sustained plasma exposure in the rat after oral administration.

Introduction Cytochrome P450-mediated epoxidation of arachidonic acid yields four regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETsa) that display vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, and analgesic, as well as migratory and proliferative properties.1-3 The intriguing biological properties and complex biology of EETs have drawn attention to the role of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) as the enzyme primarily responsible for the further metabolic conversion of these regioisomeric epoxides (Figure 1).4,5 Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) promotes the hydrolysis of EETs to their pharmacologically less active and more rapidly cleared dihydroxy epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs).6 Researchers have hypothesized that the selective inhibition of sEH will lead to an increase in circulating levels of EETs, resulting in the potentiation of their in vivo pharmacological properties.1,2 In accordance with this hypothesis, several reports have been published that demonstrate efficacy of small molecule inhibitors of sEH in cardiovascular animal models and in models of inflammation.7-9 We recently decided to determine the potential of sEH inhibitors as vasodilators and as cardio- or renal-protective agents. At the onset of our studies, two potent sEH inhibitors, 1-cyclohexyl-3-dodecylurea (CDU) and 12-(3-adamantan-1PDB files for the complexes soluble epoxide hydrolase and inhibitors 1 and 24 (PDB identifiers 3I1Y and 3I28, respectively) have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

yl-ureido)dodecanoic acid (AUDA), had been extensively utilized as tool compounds (Figure 2). Common structural features of these inhibitors are the large hydrophobic domains flanking their central urea pharmacophore.10-14 Reasoning that these large hydrophobic domains may limit the "druglike" characteristics and pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds, we elected to perform a high-throughput screen of our in-house compound collection in order to identify a structurally different starting point for an optimization process. N-(3,3-Diphenyl-propyl)-nicotinamide (Figure 3, 1) was identified as a potent inhibitor of sEH and selected as the starting point for lead optimization. Optimization of 1 was guided by the analysis of its in vitro metabolic profile and by the close examination of its solid-state structure when bound to human sEH. Our analysis led to the identification of a new class of functionalized 3,3-diphenylpropylamine arylamides that are potent inhibitiors of sEH activity in both molecular and cell-based assays. A compound from this class, 4-cyanoN-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonyl-phenyl)-propyl]benzamide (24), was found to display attractive stability profiles in rat and human liver microsomes and high and sustained plasma exposure in the rat after oral administration. Chemistry The identified lead N-(3,3-diphenyl-propyl)-nicotinamide (1) was resynthesized from nicotinic acid and (3,3-diphenylpropyl)-amine using hydroxybenzotriazole, 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide, and Hunig's base in dimethylformamide, as described in the general procedure for amide coupling. Our initial SAR focused on structural modifications to define an optimized scaffold for sEH inhibition (Tables 1-3). Subsequent chemical functionalizations were

Figure 1. Cytochrome P450-mediated epoxidation of arachidonic acid yields four regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs are further metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to yield their corresponding and generally less active vicinal dihydroxy epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). Inhibition of sEH selectively over the CYP 450 expoxygenases has been hypothesized to lead to an increase in circulating EETs levels, resulting in the potentiation of their in vivo beneficial pharmacological effects.

Recent studies of structurally simple inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-dodecylurea (CDU) and 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)dodecanoic acid (AUDA) (Figure 2), has confirmed a role for the inhibition of sEH in both cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Common structural features of these inhibitors are the large hydrophobic domains flanking the central urea pharmacophore, which may limit the "drug-like" characteristics of these compounds.

designed to improve metabolic stability. Standard methods for chemical synthesis and commercial starting materials were used unless otherwise described (see below and Experimental Section). The effect of a change in the tether length between the amide pharmacophore and the benzhydryl motif of N-(3,3diphenylpropyl)-nicotinamide 1 was investigated by the synthesis of the 2,2-diphenylethyl and 4,4-diphenylbutyl derivatives (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). 4,4-Diphenylbutylamine, required for the synthesis of compound 3, was available according to literature procedures.15 The importance of the right-hand side benzhydryl motif was investigated by the synthesis of its 3-phenylpropyl analogue in which one phenyl is omitted (Table 1, entry 4). In addition, the effect of a transposition of the left-hand side 3-pyridiyl pharmacophore by insertion of a methylene spacer was investigated by the synthesis of the 3-pyridylacetamide analogue of 1 (Table 1, entry 5). To define the importance of the central amide pharmacophore, compounds were synthesized in which the amide configuration was either reversed (Table 2, entry 6) or replaced by a sulfonamide (Table 2, entry 7). The prerequisite 4,4-diphenyl-butyric acid for the synthesis of compound 6 was prepared from 4-phenyl-butyrolactone, benzene, and aluminum chloride according to the described literature procedure.16 The effect of transposition or omission of the left-hand side pyridyl heteroatom of 1 was examined by preparing its regioisomeric 2-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl analogues (Table 3,

entries 8 and 9) and by synthesizing the corresponding benzamide analogue in which the heteroatom is omitted (Table 3, entry 10). Our profiling of compounds 1-10 defined N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-arylamide as a preferred scaffold for sEH inhibition (Tables 1-3), and subsequent chemical functionalizations were carried out to improve the poor in vitro metabolic stability of this compound class (see Results and Discussion Section). The effect of polar substituents on the left-hand side aromatic ring system was examined through the synthesis of the nicotinamide (11), 6-hydroxy-nicotinamide (12), 6-(2,2, 2-trifluoro-ethoxy)-nicotinamide (13), 2-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy)-isonicotinamide (14), 4-cyano-benzamide (15), and 4-methanesulfonyl-benzamide (16) derivatives in the context of a bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-modified benzhydryl right-hand side motif (Table 4, entries 11-16). The prerequisite 3,3-bis-(4fluorophenyl)-propylamine for these transformations was prepared similarly to published methods.17 Briefly, 4,40 -difluorobenzophenone was reacted with the anion of acetonitrile to give 3,3-bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropionitrile, which upon reduction with lithium aluminum hydride and aluminum trichloride gave the desired 3,3-bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-propylamine. On the basis of our analysis of the solid-state structure of 1 bound to human sEH, and in a further effort to improve metabolic stability profiles for this compound class, the synthesis of inhibitors with unsymmetrically substituted benzhydryl right-hand sides was undertaken (Table 5, entries 21-25). Access to the desired 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonyl-phenyl)-propylamine intermediate (20) proceeded via a Pd2(dba)3 mediated Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between 4-(methanesufonyl)benzeneboronic acid and 3-chloro-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-acrylonitrile (Scheme 1, 17) as we have previously reported.18 The resulting unsymmetrically substituted acrylonitrile (18) was subjected to catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate to give the t-Boc-protected propylamino derivative (19). Removal of the t-Boc group gave the desired propylamino intermediate, 20, after treatment with aqueous hydrochloric acid in methanol. The effect of this unsymmetrical functionalization of the benzhydryl motif was assessed by the synthesis of a similar set of substituted nicotinic and benzoic acids as examined for the bis-(4-fluorophenyl) modified benzhydryl motif (Table 5, entries 21-25). To fully exploit the fact that the aromatic rings of the benzhydryl motif experience different electronic environments within the protein (see Results and Discussion Section), the

synthesis of optically pure analogues was undertaken (Scheme 2 and Table 5, entries S-24, R-24, S-22, and R-22). The prerequisite (S)- and (R)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonyl-phenyl)-propylamines 34a and 34b were accessed from 4-fluorocinnamic acid (26) by coupling to the appropriate chiral auxiliary, (R)-(-)-4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone or (S)-(þ)-4-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone (Scheme 2). Couplings proceeded via the in situ formation of the mixed anhydrides, using pivaloyl chloride and triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran, to give the desired 3-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-acryloyl]-(R)-4-phenyl-oxazolidin-2-one (27a) and 3-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-acryloyl]-(R)-4phenyl-oxazolidin-2-one (27b). Chiral functionalization to give the (R,R)- and (S,S)-diastereoisomeric 4-methanesulfanylphenyl oxazolidinone intermediates 28a and 28b proceeded from 27a and 27b via an asymmetric conjugate addition using the in situ generated organocopper reagent available by reaction of thioanisole magnesium bromide with copper(I)bromide-methylsulfide complex in tetrahydrofuran. The removal of the chiral auxiliary was performed under standard conditions, with sodium borohydride in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water, to give the optically pure alcohols 29a and 29b. Further chemical transformation of these alcohols to their corresponding azides 30a and 30b was accomplished by reaction with toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine in dichloromethane, followed by the replacement of the tosylate using sodium azide in

N,N0 -dimethylformamide. The resulting azide intermediates 30a and 30b were treated with a mixture of aqueous hydrogen peroxide and glacial acetic acid to give 31a and 31b, respectively. Subsequent catalytic reduction in methanol gave the methanesulfoxide-functionalized t-Boc-protected propylamino derivatives 32a and 32b after treatment with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. Oxidation of the methanesulfoxides 32a and 32b was accomplished by the treatment with oxone in the presence of aluminum oxide to afford the methanesulfoxide derivatives 33a and 33b, which were subjected to treatment with trifluoroacetic acid to afford the desired R- and S-enantiomers of 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonyl-phenyl)-propylamine, 34a and 34b, respectively. Results and Discussion N-(3,3-Diphenyl-propyl)-nicotinamide (Figure 3, 1) was identified as a potent inhibitor of sEH through high throughput screening. Further profiling of this lead compound revealed short half-lives in both human and rat liver microsomes and rapid clearance in the rat (data not shown). A lead optimization process was undertaken with the goal to improve in vitro metabolic stability as an avenue to identify compounds with high and sustained plasma exposure in the rat. Compounds were evaluated in binding assays for their ability to displace a rhodamine-labeled probe from either human or rat sEH using a fluorescence polarization readout (see Experimental Section for methods). Selected compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit the sEH-mediated conversion of 14,15-epoxyeicosatienoic acid to 14,15-dihydroxyeicosa-

trienoic acid in human Hep G2 cells using an ELISA readout. Metabolic stability was an important driver of the SAR for this compound class, and for selected compounds, half-lives in human and rat liver microsomes were determined as a measure of first-pass metabolism (see Experimental Section for methods). Compound exposure in rat was assessed after oral administration at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post dosing (see Experimental Section for methods). In an initial set of compounds, the length of the linker between the central amide pharmacophore and the right-hand side benzhydryl motif was varied from ethyl through propyl to butyl, leading to the finding that the propyl linker is optimal for inhibitory potency (Table 1, entries 1-3). Truncation to the ethyl-linked derivative resulted in complete loss of activity (IC50 > 3000 nM for both human and rat sEH), whereas the extension of the propyl linker by one methylene unit resulted in a 17-fold decline in potency against human sEH (IC50 120 nM) and a 4-fold decline in potency against the rat sEH isoform (IC50 26 nM). The importance of the benzhydryl pharmacophore for potent sEH inhibition was demonstrated by the omission of a phenyl ring from this motif to give the 3-phenyl propylamide analogue (Table 1, entry 4). This compound displayed large declines in inhibitory potency for both sEH isoforms (IC50 700 and 70 nM for the human and rat isoforms, respectively). The transposition of the left-hand side pyridyl moiety by one methylene unit was examined by the evaluation of the 3-pyridylacetamide compound, 5, which displayed a moderate inhibitory effect on sEH activity (IC50 31 and 150 nM for the human and rat isoforms, respectively). In another set of compounds, the amide pharmacophore of 1 was either reversed or replaced with a sulfonamide (Table 2, entries 6 and 7). The potency of the compound in which the amide was reversed was moderately reduced compared to 1 (IC50 45 and 18 nM, for the human and rat isoforms, respectively). The compound in which the amide pharmacophore was replaced with sulfonamide completely lost its ability to inhibit sEH activity (see below for an analysis of this finding). Taken together, these findings (Tables 1 and 2) suggest that the benzhydryl motif is an important pharmacophore

a (R)-3-(4-Fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonyl-phenyl)-propyl amine (R-20) was prepared similarly starting from the enantiomeric (S)-(þ)-4phenyl-2-oxazolidinone.

for sEH and that both its phenyl ring systems contribute to the molecular recognition of the enzyme. Moreover, the data indicates that the exact position of the central amide pharmacophore relative to the benzhydryl motif is crucial for inhibition of sEH activity by this class of compounds, probably reflecting a relatively tight fit of the benzhydryl moiety with the enzyme. To better understand the molecular basis for the observed inactivity of the sulfonamide analogue (7), this compound was docked into the structure of human sEH obtained in-house with compound 1 cocrystallized (vide supra and Figure 5a,b for solid-state structure and Figure 4a,b for docking studies). Compound 7 was docked into the catalytic site using the program Glide assuming the same binding mode and exhibiting the same hydrogen bonding interaction pattern with the enzyme as observed for the benzamide 1 (Figure 4). Among a variety of docking conformations that differed slightly in how the sulfonamide atoms interacted with Asp 335, Tyr 383, and Tyr 466, a high energy trans (Figure 4a) and low energy cis (Figure 4b) sulfonamide conformation generated the highest docking scores.19 The high energy trans sulfonamide displayed hydrogen bonding interaction patterns between the sulfonamide moiety and sEH that were energetically favorable: one of the sulfonyl oxygen atoms engaged in hydrogen

bonds to Tyr 383 and Tyr 466. The second sulfonyl oxygen was positioned in hydrogen bonding distance to Tyr 383, and the sulfonamide nitrogen formed a hydrogen bond with the Asp 335 residue. Not surprisingly, this docking pose exhibited the highest Glide eModel score. In contrast, the energetically favored cis sulfonamide conformation could only be assumed by placing one of its sulfonyl oxygen atoms in close proximity to one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic acid side chain ° moiety of Asp 335 (2.9 A), giving rise to an energetically unfavorable contact (Figure 4b). While showing a reduced eModel score, this binding pose exhibited the highest Glidescore. On the basis of these docking models, we hypothesize that the observed inactivity of 7 results from its inability to assume a low energy conformation as well as energetically favorable hydrogen bonding interactions with active site residues. This hypothesis is consistent with the strong conformational preference found for aromatic cis sulfonamides in protein-ligand complexes available in the Cambridge Crystallographic Database and the Protein Data Bank.20 DFT/ B3LYP calculations with a 6-31G** basis set revealed that there is a 4 kcal energy difference favoring the cis sulfonamide conformation over the trans conformation after optimizing the geometries, holding the pyridyl/sulfonamide and sulfur-nitrogen bonds fixed. The energy difference between

Figure 4. Putative binding modes of the inactive sulfonamide 7 (gray). (a) The high energy trans conformer displays energetically favorable hydrogen bonding interaction patterns with one sulfonyl oxygen engaged in hydrogen bonds (black dotted lines) to Tyr 383 and Tyr 466 and the second sulfonyl oxygen positioned in hydrogen bonding distance to Tyr 383. The sulfonamide nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with Asp 335. The crystallographically obtained binding pose of 1 has been added for comparison (cyan). (b) The low energy cis sulfonamide conformation places one sulfonyl oxygen atom in close proximity to one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic acid side chain moiety of Asp 335, resulting in an energetically unfavorable contact (red dotted line).

cis and trans sulfonamides is consistent with earlier observations.21 Allowing the pyridyl/sulfonamide to be optimized reduces the energy difference to 2 kcal/mol; however, the energetically favored orientation of the pyridyl group would now lead to unfavorable interactions with Trp 336 (data not shown). The importance of the left-hand side aromatic moiety of 1 was further delineated by evaluating analogues in which the 3-pyridyl ring was replaced with 2-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, or phenyl (Table 3, entries 8-10). The 4-pyridyl and phenyl derivatives 9 and 10 were both potent inhibitors of human and rat sEH, with IC50s ranging from 5 to 8 nM. In contrast, the 2-pyridyl derivative displayed a loss in inhibitory potency averaging 12- to 14-fold relative to 1 (IC50 100 and 43 nM for human and rat sEH, respectively). A plausible explanation for the reduced potency of 8 compared to 1 invokes an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen and the 2-pyridyl nitrogen, leading the pyridyl ring system to adopt a coplanar conformation with the amide, thereby positioning its ° 2-pyridyl nitrogen in close proximity (3.3 A) to the charged oxygen atoms of the Asp 335 side chain, resulting in a repulsive electrostatic interaction. This rationale was supported by comparing interaction energies between 1 and 8 within human sEH using a cocrystal structure of 1 (vide supra and Figure 5) and a model of 8 in the identical conformation as basis for the calculations. Using the OPLS2005 force field, a difference of 1.7 kcal/mol favoring 1 over 8 was calculated. Evaluation of the in vitro metabolic stability profiles for these first sets of compounds (Tables 1 and 3) indicated rapid metabolism in human and rat liver microsomes (see Experimental Section for method). We anticipated that the observed rapid in vitro metabolism would translate to rapid clearance in vivo, hence limiting the sustained in vivo plasma exposure of these compounds. In accordance with this hypothesis, the plasma levels of 1 in the rat after oral administration were quickly depleted over time (data not shown), supporting the assumption that in vitro metabolic stability is predictive of in vivo clearance for this compound class. Careful examination of the in vitro metabolites generated from 1 in rat liver microsomes confirmed the extensive hydroxylation of the phenyl groups of the benzhydryl motif, which accounted for

76.9% of the total metabolite area. The bis-(4-fluorophenyl) analogue of 1 (Table 4, entry 11) was synthesized to assess the impact of blocking the presumed metabolically vulnerable sites with fluoro atoms. However, examination of the in vitro metabolic profile of compound 11 revealed an apparent shift in the major route of metabolism to hydroxylation of the pyridine, now representing 76.1% of the total metabolite area. The stability of 11 in liver microsomes was assessed and found to be relatively short at 12 min in both human and rat liver microsomes (Table 4, entry 11). Taken together, the shift to hydroxylation of the pyridine moiety and the fact that in vitro metabolism remained rapid for the fluorinated analogue suggested to us a propensity for metabolite switching. The intrinsic potency of the bis-(4-fluorophenyl) analogue (Table 4, entry 11) was evaluated and found to be unchanged relative to 1 (IC50s 8 and 7 nM for human sEH and rat sEH, respectively). Hypothesizing that an increase in the overall polarity of these molecules might decrease first-pass metabolism, we decided to explore the effect of left-hand side substitution in the context of the bis-(4-fluorophenyl) modified right-hand side. Hence, the effect of small, polar substituents such as hydroxyl, trifluoroethoxy, cyano, and methanesulfonyl on benzhydryl moiety was examined in the context of the 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, and phenyl left-hand sides. Potent inhibition of both human and rat sEH was observed for these derivatives with IC50s ranging from 5 to 9 nM (Table 4, entries 12-16). However, the examination of the in vitro half-lives of these compounds revealed large differences in metabolic stabilities as a result of left-hand side substitution. The inclusion of hydroxy and trifluoroethoxy substituents resulted in significant improvements in metabolic stabilities, most dramatically illustrated by the 6-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy)-nicotinamide analogue, 13, which displayed a half-life in excess of 300 min in both human and rat liver microsomes. For compounds 14, 15, and 16, the improvement in the metabolic stability in human microsomes was less dramatic and their half-lives in rat liver microsomes remained short at about 5 min. The identification of 13 as an in vitro metabolically stable and potent sEH inhibitor prompted us to assess its exposure in the rat. Following oral administration of 13 at 5 mg/kg, plasma concentrations were more sustained over time compared to 1 but remained low, reaching only 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, and 0  at the 1, 2, 4, and 6 h time points, respectively. Because of its poor aqueous solubility (less than 0.1 g/mL at pH 7.4), 13 could not be evaluated for intestinal permeability in our in-house caco-2 assay. The solid-state structure of the co-stucture of 1 and human sEH was determined to provide guidance for the design of compounds with increased metabolic stability and improved physicochemical properties while maintaining excellent binding characteristics. As shown previously, the active site in both rat and human sEH is formed by a channel in the protein between two large, solvent accessible pockets, with the active site tyrosine and aspartic residues encircling the ligand.22-24 The costructure of 1 (Figure 5a) reveals the amide moiety of 1 positioned in a similar orientation to that observed previously for urea-based inhibitors, with the carbonyl oxygen directed toward the two tyrosines in the active site and the amide proton directed toward the aspartic acid. The structure shows the pyridine ring placed in the Trp 336 niche (adopting a similar nomenclature to that of Gomez et al.24) forming a -stacking interaction with the tryptophan residue. The -stacking interaction results in the pyridine ring adopting a similar orientation to that reported for the phenyl group in the

murine sEH N-cyclohexyl-N0 -(4-iodophenyl) urea (CIU) structure.25 The trajectory of the propyl linker between the amide and benzhydryl motif is similar to that reported for the cyclohexyl urea compounds, with the molecule stretching from the active site triad toward the Phe 267 pocket. At this point, compound 1 bifurcates with one phenyl group, designated here as C2, directed toward the back of the Phe 267 pocket, and the other, referred here as C3, pointing toward the solvent opening. The phenyl directed to the rear of the pocket has a different trajectory from that seen in other sEH inhibitors: the cocrystal structure of human sEH with the CIU inhibitor does occupy some of the same space as the phenyl group, but the 4-iodo phenyl in that inhibitor is not directed as deeply toward the core of the protein. In the costructure with 1, the C2 phenyl group is surrounded by hydrophobic residues (Phe 267, Pro 268, Phe 387, Leu 397, Leu 406, Leu 417, Leu 428, Leu 463). It

is of interest to note that the C2 phenyl group does not fully occupy this pocket, which suggests that additional potency may be gained by more completely filling this pocket with hydrophobic substituents. The C3 phenyl group in 1 is directed toward the solvent opening of the Phe 267 pocket (Figure 5b). Previous inhibitor-sEH costructures have shown that this region of the protein can accommodate a variety of substituents, including cyclohexyl and carboxylic acid groups. In the costructure with 1, the phenyl ring is positioned to allow -stacking interaction with His 524. This interaction results in the ring lying close to one side of the pocket. In contrast, the cyclohexyl and acid moieties, seen in other structures, have tended to lie slightly more to the center of the pocket. The fact that the two phenyl groups in the costructure of 1 occupy very different environments within the protein, one directed to a hydrophobic region of the protein, the other positioned in a more polar and solvent exposed environment,

Figure 6. X-ray cocrystal structure of human sEH and 24. The 2fo - fc map contoured at 0.95, showing that 24 binds in a similar mode to 1. The structure reveals that the 4-fluorophenyl group is directed into the hydrophobic environment of the Phe 267 pocket, whereas the 4-methanesulphonyl substituted phenyl group is directed toward the solvent.

suggests that the introduction of asymmetry may be accommodated by the binding site. Asymmetric functionalization to exploit these differences might provide a path to the improvement of physicochemical properties as well as to improved potency. In pursuit of this idea, methanesulfonyl, a polar and nonionizable substituent, was introduced in the phenyl 4-position of the benzhydryl motif. The 4-fluoro substitution of the phenyl was maintained to prevent oxidative metabolism at this position. The effect of this combination of substituents on intrinsic potency and in vitro metabolic stability was probed by the synthesis of the racemic analogues 21-25 (Table 5) in which the left-hand side aryl pharmacophore was either unsubstituted or substituted with hydroxyl, 2,2, 2-trifluoroethyloxy, cyano, or methanesulfonyl. The inclusion of the methanesulfonyl substituent on the benzhydryl motif of the nicotinamide derivative, 21, resulted in an sEH inhibitor with largely uncompromised potency relative to 1 (IC50s 8 and 14 nM for human and rat sEH, respectively). The 6-hydroxynicotinamide analogue of this compound (22) displayed a minor decrease in intrinsic potency against the human and rat sEH isoforms (IC50s 16 and 29 nM, respectively), whereas the 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, cyano, and methanesulfonyl substituted analogues 23, 24, and 25 remained equipotent to 1, with IC50s ranging from 4 to 7 nM against human sEH and from 6 to 9 nM against the rat enzyme. These results indicate that the methanesulfonyl substitution is well accommodated by sEH. As might be anticipated, the in vitro metabolism of the nicotinamide derivative, 21, which lacks a left-hand side substituent, remained rapid in both human and rat liver microsomes, with half-lives of 6 and 12 min, respectively. In contrast, the in vitro half-lives for the analogues with polar left-hand side substituents (Table 5, 22-25) ranged from a minimum value of 150 min to greater than 300 min, demonstrating that highly in vitro metabolically stable inhibitors can be achieved with this scaffold. The plasma levels of the sEH inhibitor 24 were determined in the rat after oral administration at 5 mg/kg (see Experimental Section for methods). Compound plasma exposure was 3.8, 3.5, 3.6, and 2.9 M at the 1, 2, 4, and 6 h time-points, respectively, identifying this

compound as a potent, in vitro metabolically stable sEH inhibitor, with sustained exposure in the rat. To confirm that the unsymmetrically substituted analogue 24 bound in the expected orientation, a cocrystal structure with human sEH was obtained (Figure 6). The structure obtained confirmed the anticipated binding mode with very little difference in the position of the central amide core of the molecule in relation to the protein compared to the costructure with 1. In the Trp 336 niche, the phenyl group of the 4-cyano-phenyl lies in a similar orientation to the 3-pyridyl of 1. The cyano group is well accommodated within the large solvent-filled cavity of the Trp 336 niche, with Met 339 moving to accommodate the substituent. As expected, the 4-fluorophenyl group occupies the same space as the C2 phenyl in the costructure with 1, the phenyl group lying in a very similar plane. It was noted earlier in the context of the costructure of 1 that the C2 phenyl group did not fully occupy the deep hydrophobic pocket. As anticipated, the 4-fluorophenyl group of 24 is accommodated by the pocket. The 4-methanesulfonyl substituted phenyl group, which was designed to capitalize on the more hydrophilic nature of the C3 pocket, lies in a similar orientation to the C3 group of 1, with the methanesulfonyl substituent in close proximity to several polar groups including the side chains of Ser 425 and Asp 496 and the backbone carbonyl of Ser 412. Our evaluation of the unsymmetrically substituted inhibitors 21-25 (Table 5) indicate that the polar methanesulfonyl substituent is well accommodated by sEH and that the observed improvements in microsomal stabilities lead to decreased in vivo clearance. To better understand the importance of asymmetry for the molecular recognition of sEH, a small set of enantiopure analogues was synthesized (Table 6, entries S-24, R-24, S22, and R-22). The corresponding enantiomers of 24 displayed a 2- to 4-fold difference in potency in favor of the S-enantiomer S-24 (IC50 8 and 6 nM, for human and rat isoforms, respectively) over the R-enantiomer R-24 (IC50 14 and 24 nM, for human and rat isoforms, respectively). These results are in agreement with our analysis of the solid-state structure, which predicts that the

a Enantiopure compounds were synthesized to examine the importance of the asymmetry for the inhibition of sEH.

S-enantiomer will position the polar methanesulfonyl subtituent in the C3 pocket, leaving the 4-fluorophenyl group to occupy the relatively hydrophobic C2 pocket. The evaluation of the enantiomers of the intrinsically less potent 22, S-22, and R-22 confirmed the preference for placement of the hydrophilic methanesulfonyl substituent in the C3 binding pocket, in this case suggesting a greater, 4- to 12-fold, difference between the intrinsic potency of the S-enantiomer S-22 (IC50s 6 and 7 nM, for human and rat sEH) over the R-enantiomer R-22 (IC50s 23 and 87 nM, for human and rat sEH). Because of a limitation imposed by the affinity of the probe, the binding assay used in our studies can not provide an accurate ranking of compounds with IC50s less than approximately 5 nM. To get a more accurate measure of the relative potencies of the advanced compounds 21-25 (Tables 5 and 6), their profiling was extended to include a cell-based assay in Hep G2 cells. Evaluation of the unsymmetrically substituted sEH inhibitors (Table 5, 21-25) in the cell-based assay confirmed the ranking observed in the fluorescence polarization assay (IC50s 4, 6, 7 nM, respectively) and revealed that compounds 23, 24, and 25 are in fact of equal potency (EC50s 0.3, 0.3, and 0.4 nM, respectively). In contrast, the evaluation of the enantiopure derivatives (Table 6, S-24, R-24, S-22, and R-22), revealed larger differences in the potency of the S- and R-enantiomers than estimated from the profiling in the fluorescence polarization assay. In fact, the data acquired in the cell-based assay suggests 14-20 fold differences in potency in favor of the S-enantiomers relative to the R-enantiomers with an EC50 of 0.14 nM for the S-enantiomer of 24 (S-24). Conclusions In conclusion, 4-cyano-N-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonyl-phenyl)-propyl]-benzamide, 24, was identified as a

potent sEH inhibitor with attractive in vitro stability profiles in rat and human liver microsomes and good oral exposure in the rat. The structure-activity relationship of the lead, 1, reveals a relatively strict requirement to the distance between the central amide and benzhydryl motif, emphasizing the importance of the amide as a recognition element for sEH and suggesting a tight fit between the benzhydryl pharmacophore and the enzyme. In contrast, the structure-activity relationship reveals no particular structural requirements to the left-hand side aryl pharmacophore. Although not preferred, the transposition of this pharmacophore is allowed and substitution is well tolerated, as is the replacement of the 3pyridyl pharmacophore with other (hetero)aryl groups. The above observations are corroborated by the costructure of 1 with sEH, in which the C3 phenyl appears to participate in a -stacking interaction with His 524, and the C2 phenyl is in relatively close contact with several hydrophobic residues. The importance of the interaction between the central amide pharmacophore and the Tyr 466, Tyr 383, and Asp 335 residues can not be overemphasized and is illustrated by the diminished activity of the compound in which the amide configuration is reversed and the complete abrogation of activity for the sulfonamide derivative. Optimization of the in vitro and in vivo metabolic parameters was accomplished using an integrated approach of metabolite identification and structure-based drug design aimed at preserving the inherently high inhibitory activity of this lead class. The identification of metabolically vulnerable sites and subsequent substitution with fluoro atoms led to the identification of an in vitro metabolically stable inhibitor, 13. However, good in vitro metabolic stability for this compound is likely attained at the expense of suitable physicochemical properties and efficient in vivo absorption. Guided by the analysis of the costructure of 1 with human sEH, one fluorine atom was substituted for an additional polar substituent on the right-hand side benzhydryl motif, leading to the identification of a class of potent and in vitro metabolically stable sEH inhibitors. Compound 24 from this class was profiled extensively (Scheme 3) and was found to have a low potential for drug-drug interactions, good selectivity against EETs-generating CYP epoxygenases such as CYP2J2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9, excellent in vitro microsomal stability, and high permeability in caco-2 cells (data not shown). The oral administration of 24 in the rat led to sustained compound exposure in plasma in the 3-4 M range. Considering its overall profile, 24 is an appropriate candidate for in vivo pharmacological profiling. Experimental Section

a The original screening hit 1 displayed high potency against both human and rat sEH and acceptable selectivity towards EETs forming CYPs but lacked in vitro metabolic stability. SAR to define an optimal scaffold for sEH inhibition, paired with substitution of the right-hand side benzhydryl motif with fluoro atoms, led to the identification of an in vitro metabolically stable inhibitor, 13. However, good in vitro metabolic stability for this compound was attained at the expense of efficient in vivo absorption. Guided by the analysis of the co-structure of 1 with human sEH, one fluorine atom was substituted for an additional polar substituent, leading to the identification of compound 24. This compound was found to have a low potential for drug-drug interactions, good selectivity against EETs-generating CYP epoxygenases such as CYP2J2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9, excellent in vitro microsomal stability, and high and sustained compound exposure in the rat.

In Vitro Molecular Assay for Inhibition of Human or Rat sEH. This assay identifies compounds that inhibit the binding interaction of either human or rat soluble epoxide hydrolase with a tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled probe. Test compounds were dissolved and serially diluted in DMSO, with final dilution in assay buffer (20 mM TES, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% w/v CHAPS, 1 mM TCEP, pH=7.0) to achieve 1% DMSO in the assay. Test compounds were dispensed into a black, flat-bottom 96-well plate. Positive controls were reaction mixtures containing no test compound; negative controls (blanks) were reaction mixtures containing a reference inhibitor. The reaction was started with the addition of a mixture of either human or rat sEH (final assay concentration is 10 nM) and probe (final assay concentration is 2.5 nM). The reaction was mixed by briefly shaking the plate on an orbital shaker, and the plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence polarization is measured on an LJL Analyst using a 530 nm excitation filter, a 580 nm emission filter, and a 561 nm dichroic mirror. Concentration-response data were fitted to a 4-parameter equation to determine IC50 values. In Vitro Cellular Assay for Inhibition of sEH in Human Hep G2 Cells. This assay identifies compounds that inhibit the ability of soluble epoxide hydrolase to convert 14,15-epoxy-eicosatienoic acid to 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid in human HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells, grown in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were seeded at 20000 cells/well in 96-well poly D-lysine-coated plates 18 h prior to the assay. On the day of the assay, test compounds were dissolved and serially diluted in DMSO, with final dilution in assay medium (low glucose DMEM containing 6.6 g/mL BSA) to achieve a 0.3% DMSO in the assay. Positive controls were wells containing no test compound; negative controls (blanks) were reaction mixtures containing a reference inhibitor. The growth medium was aspirated from the cells, they were washed once with phosphate buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium, and assay medium was added. Test compounds were dispensed into the plates, which were then placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 30 min. After addition of 14,15-epoxyeicosatienoic acid to a final concentration of 330 nM, the plates were placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 h. Quantitation of 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid in the supernatants was performed using a commercially available ELISA kit (cat. no. DH 21 from Detroit R&D, Inc.). Concentration-response data were fitted to a 4-parameter equation to determine IC50 values. Assessment of Stability in Rat and Human Liver Microsomes. The stability of the compounds in rat and human liver microsomes were determined by calculating the half-lives of compounds from two time points (0 and 30 min). The incubation consisted of a microsomal content was 1 mg/mL, a NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase) concentration of 2.5 mM, and a compound concentration of 1 M. All compounds were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min on a Tecan Genesis. Following preincubation, NADPH was added and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on a Tecan Genesis. Reactions were stopped when 80 uL of each sample was collected at 0 and 30 min and crashed with 160 L of cold acetonitrile. The crashed samples were filtered and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The half-life of disappearance of parent molecule (t1/2) was calculated by dividing 0.693 by the slope of parent loss. Methods for Computational Analyses of Compounds 7 and 8.

° 100 kcal/mol/A2. Two hydrogen bonding constraints to Asp 335 and to either Tyr 383 or Tyr 466 were required for accepted docking solutions. Standard conditions were chosen for all other docking parameters. Force field calculations were performed using the OPLS2005 force field as implemented by Schrodinger Inc. Geometry optimization calculations were performed using DFT/B3LYP with a 6-31G** basis set using Jaguar6.5.27 Method for Identification of in Vitro Metabolites. Additional incubations were optimized to identify the phase I metabolites of 1 and 15. The incubations consisted of a microsomal content of 1 mg/mL, a NADPH concentration of 2.5 mM, and a compound concentration of 10 M. The mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 4 min. The reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH. Control samples were prepared in the absence of NADPH, where additional buffer was added to equal the volume of NADPH added to the test compound mixtures. The reactions were continued for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 1 mL of ice cold acetonitrile. The resulting mixtures were vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged to remove particulates. The control and test compound supernatants (1 mL each) were dried under nitrogen at 40 °C. The dried supernatants were reconstituted in H2O/acetonitrile/acetic acid (70/30/0.1, v/v/v), vortexed, and centrifuged. A LC/MS/MS system consisting of a Hewlett-Packard Series 1100 system (auto injector, pump, and diode array detector) and a Micromass Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for the metabolite ID experiments. LC/MS/MS experiments were conducted to obtain full scan spectra and product ion spectra for the protonated parent ions of the compounds and the phase I metabolites. Assessment of Compound Exposure in Rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Co.) were purchased precannulated (jugular catheter) in order to facilitate precise blood sampling times to increase throughput and to reduce the stress on the animals caused by serial bleedings. Three fed rats were dosed orally with one compound at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Blood was collected into heparin-containing tubes serially from each animal at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h postdosing and centrifuged to generate plasma. The plasma samples were stored at -20 °C until analysis. The plasma concentrations were obtained by extraction of the compound from an aliquot of rat plasma by precipitation of proteins with acetonitrile and quantitation by LC/MS/MS. The LC/MS/MS system consisted of a HewlettPackard Series 1100 pump, Leap Technologies injector, and an Applied Biosystems API4000 mass spectrometer. The LC/MS/ MS system was operated in multireaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Expression and Purification of Human sEH. Human soluble epoxide hydrolase was obtained using a baculovirus expression system. The cells were lysed using sonication in a buffer containing 20 mM MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) pH 7.4, 75 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol 1 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid), 1 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 3 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), g/mL pepstatin, and 4 g/mL leupeptin. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto a benzyl-thio sepharose column that had been equilibrated with 20 mM MOPS pH 7.4, 75 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM DTT. The protein was eluted using the same buffer as used for equilibration plus 1 mM trans-1,3-diphenyl2,3-epoxypropan-1-one (chalcone oxide). The eluted protein was then concentrated and dialyzed against a buffer containing 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT. Plasma levels of 1 and 13 were determined using a 1% CMC/0.2% Tween80/98.8% water formulation, whereas a 80% PEG 400/20% pH2 30 mM citric acid formulation was used for the determination of plasma levels of 24. Crystallization and Structure Determination. Crystals of apo sEH were obtained using the hanging drop method. Drops were prepared by combining 5 L of the protein at a concentration of

12 mg/mL with 5 L of a well solution containing: 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 36% PEG 3350, and 0.1 M Tris pH 8.4 and 0.5 L of 0.006 mM -D-hexadecyl maltoside. Crystals were observed to grow within 1 week at 4 °C. A 100 mM stock solution of compounds 1 and 24 were prepared in DMSO. Prior to addition of compound, crystals were transferred to a stabilizing solution containing 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 40% PEG 3350, and 0.1 M Tris pH 8.4. The stock compound solution was added to the drop containing the protein to give a final concentration of 10 mM. The crystals were then allowed to soak for 1 week at 4 °C. Cryoprotection of the crystals was achieved by gradually adding sucrose to the stabilizing solution to a final concentration of 20%. The crystals were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data for the cocrystal containing 1 was collected on the SGX-CAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source using a ° wavelength of 0.929 A and a MAR165 CCD 165. Diffraction data for the cocrystal containing 24 was collected on the PXI beamline Swiss Light Source using a MAR 225 CCD. Data reduction was performed using Mosflm. Molecular replacement was performed using the program AMORE in conjunction with the apo human soluble epoxide structure 1S8O.pdb. Refinement and model building was performed using CNX and Phenix. Initial refinement of the model was performed with no waters present in the model. Following the addition of water molecules to the model and subsequent rounds of refinement, the ligand was added to the model. Table 7 contains the data reduction and refinement statistics of the final models.
