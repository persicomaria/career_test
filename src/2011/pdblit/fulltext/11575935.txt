A possible switch between two conformations, previously observed in an enzymatically cleaved fragment of E. cob 5s ribosomal RNA (a Gram-negative bacterium) containing helices II and III, has been examined by means of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (lo-15 ppm) as a function of [Mg2+] and temperature for an RNase-Tl digested fragment of Bacillus megaterium 5s r-RNA (a Gram-positive bacterium) containing the same helices II and III. The conformational changes induced in the fragment are not accompanied by breakage of some base-pairs and formation of others, but rather consist simply of tightening or loosening of helices with retention of existing base-pairs. Helix III is found to be more flexible than helix II. Finally, the loop conformation is conserved over a wide range of Mg2+ concentration, suggesting that the loop may serve an important role in the biological function of 5s rRNA in ribosomes. @1990 Academic Press, Inc.

The essential function of 5s rRNA in protein synthesis (1) is widely accepted, and the base-pair sequences of several helical segments of several prokaryotic and eukaryotic 5s i-RNA's have been determined from high-field proton NMR homonuclear Overhauser enhancements (2-11) and by other physical techniques ( 12- 14). Since such spectroscopic experiments are limited to 5s r-RNA free in solution, it is necessary to introduce other variables in order to gain knowledge of RNA behavior in the ribosome. For example, flexibility and conversion between various 5s rRNA conformers may give clues as to the sites and likelihood of possible changes in 5s RNA structure on binding to ribosomal proteins (either individually or in the intact ribosome). In particular, the primary nucleotide sequence spanning helices II and III (see Figure l), to which ribosomal protein L18 binds, is recognized as # Also a member of the Department * To whom correspondence should

The existence of more than one conformation of E. coli 5s rRNA in this region has been demonstrated (16). and it has been suggested that some conformational states are biologically active whereas others are not (17). Two different conformations of the helix II-111 segment of 5s rRNA proposed by de Wachter et al. (18, 19) have been reported to interconvert at a rate which based on 1H NMR studies depends on temperature and Mg2+ concentration, of the RNase-digested fragment of E. colt (a Gram-negative bacterium) 5s rRNA containing helices II and III (20). 1069

An RNase Tl-digested fragment of Bacillus megaterium (a Gram-positive bacterium) 5s rRNA containing the helix II-III segment (hereafter denoted as fragment A) has previously been prepared (21). Fragment A (see Figure 1) has been shown to retain the original conformation of the corresponding segment of intact B. megaterium 5s rRNA. and the downfield (IO- 15 ppm) resonances of 500-MHz proton NMR spectrum have recently been assigned to the corresponding base-pairs in helices II-III (21). In this work, the conformational flexibility of the helix II-III segment of B. megaterium 5s rRNA is investigated by 500-MHz proton NMR spectroscopy. Two resonances, D1 and H, which had not previously been assigned, are now assigned as A27'u53 and C!28*G52. The possibility of two interconvertible conformations is examined by proton NMR monitoring of conformational changes induced by variation in temperature and Mg2+ concentration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample preparation The extraction and purification of 5S rRNA from Bacillus megaterium strain KM (ATCC 13632) and the preparation of RNase Tl-digested fragment A have been described in a previous report (21). A Mg2+-depleted NMR sample of B. megaterium 5s rRNA fragment A was prepared as follows. Fragment A was dissolved in 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and then dialyzed against 1000 volumes of 1 mM EDTA. 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 at 4 "C! for 5 h. The sample was then dialyzed against 1000 volumes of freshly prepared buffer overnight, and concentrated by ultrafiltration by use of an Amicon Centricon apparatus. The concentration of fragment A in the NMR sample (in 95 % aliquots of 0.5 M MgC12 H20: 5% D20) was -1 mM. For Mg 2+ titration, solution were added to produce the desired Mg2+ concentration. lT/NMR spectroscopy Proton FT/NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AM-500 FT-NMR spectrometer, by use of phase-cycled quadrature detection, without sample spinning. Water suppression was achieved by use of a 133& hard pulse sequence (22). Chemical shifts were measured relative to the water resonance, which was taken as 4.78 ppm relative to DSS [3-(trimethylsilyl)1-propanesulfonic acid) at all temperatures. For the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) difference spectra, the resonance of interest was prcirradiated for 0.5-0.6 s (-0.2 mW decoupler power) and 16K time-domain data (8000 transients of on-resonance and 8000 off-resonance) were collected. Exponential apodization equivalent to frequency-domain line broadening of l-5 Hz was usually applied to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the final spectrum, and the spectrum was plotted without baseline correction.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Conformational change of fragment A As can be seen from Figure 2. the relative intensity of resonance B (assigned as A 18'&jl-See Table 1) decreases relatively rapidly with increase 1070

of temperature while the intensity of F1 (assigned as G:!l*C58) does not change appreciably. Also, resonance I3 exhibits a smaller temperatureinduced chemical shift than resonance Fl. It is well-known that imino proton resonances of helix terminal and unpaired imino proton resonances show smaller temperature-induced chemical shifts and more rapid broadening than resonances of imino protons well-protected from solvent, such as imino protons in the middle of a base-paired helical segment. From the above results, we conclude that the open end of helix II is more exposed to solvent and is less thermally stable than the inter-helical region. The absence of observable NMR resonances corresponding to Gls*U63 and A17*U62 at room temperature further supports this interpretation. As temperature increases, helix II opens from the open end of the helix. However, helix II appears to be more stable than helix III, since resonances F1, Al, and I" [G21*C58. A2O*U5g, and GlgCsO) show relatively greater hightemperature stability than do resonances J 1, I (CsO'G4s and C2geG4g ). Increase in Mg2+ concentration also induces a more significant change in conformation of helix III than of helix II, as seen (see Figure 3) from the greater change in chemical shift for base-pair imino protons from helix III than from helix More specifically, helix III seems to tighten slightly on increase in [Mg2+], as judged from the downfield shifts of resonances I, Jl,

and I". The significant decrease in the intensity of resonance F1 with increase of Mg2+ concentration implies that Mg2+ acts to increase solvent access to G2 1*C58 in helix II, leading to faster exchange of the G21 imino proton with water. Interestingly, the broad signal (labeled as MS). which is thought to consist of superimposed resonances from unpaired imino protons of guanine and uracils in the loop region, shows no noticeable change in chemical shifts and no intensity change on addition of MgC12. Thus, the loop region appears to retain its original shape on increase in [Mg2+]. Resonances D1 and H, which could not be assigned to specific base pairs in prior work (21). can now be assigned as A27'u53 and C2s*G52, based on their strong mutual homonuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOE's) under the wide range of temperature and [MgClz] of the present experiments. In particular (see Table 1). resonance H shows NOE connectivity to resonance I (Czg*Gdg) and a smaller but measurable NOE to resonance J1 (C3o'G48) for both [Mgz+] = 0 and [Mg2+] = 15 mM. Evidence against two conformations of the helix II-111 segment The present results offer several arguments that the two-conformation switch proposed by de Wachter et al. (18, 19) and supported by Leontis and Moore's experiments (20) for E. coli 5s rRNA does not occur in B. First (see Figure 2), resonances D1 and megaterium 5s RNA (see Figure 1). H (A27'u53 and C28*G52) do not broaden and decrease in intensity quickly on increase in temperature; in fact, resonance H is quite stable at high temperature. Also, we fail to observe any resonances which decrease in linewidth and increase in intensity on increase in temperature, strongly suggesting that no new base-pairs are being formed at higher temperature. Athough the intensities of Dl and H increase slightly on increase in Mg2+ concentration (see Figure 3). their chemical shifts do not vary strongly, suggesting that the base-pairs A27'u53 and C2s*G52 remain intact from (Mg2+l = 0 - 15 mM. Additional strong evidence against two interconverting conformations is provided by the NOE experiments summarized in Table 1. There are no (or at most relatively minor) differences between NOE connectivities obtained under three conditions: 3 "C with [Mga+] = 0, 23 "C with [Mg2+l = 0, and 23 "C with [Mg2+]=15 mM. Thus, it appears that the same base-pairing pattern megaterium 5s rRNA is conserved on for the helix II-III segment of B. change in temperature or [Mg2+]. Concluding remarks It is not obvious why 5s rRNAs coZi) should exhibit two conformations positive bacteria (e.g., B. megaterium

from Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., E. (17.20) while 5s rRNA's from Gramin the present work) do not. It would 1073

seem more likely that all bacterial 5s rRNA's should have similar conformations, since (for example) the ribosomal protein L18 from Bacillus stearothermophilus can bind to 5s rRNA from E. coZi (23). Perhaps the B. megaterium 5s rRNA achieves sufficient conformational change by tightening or loosening its helix II-III region that it is not necessary to break and re-form base-pairs (as in E. col.i 5s rRNA). In any case, since it is difficult to generalize from two examples, it may be worth investigating the conformations of a few more 5s rRNAs (both Gram-positive and Gramnegative) to see if either of the above results represents a general behavior.
