zaMg NMR spectroscopy was used to study the interactions of the activating cations with their respective binding sites in the enzymes yeast enolase and rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK). Titration of Mgz+ with enolase allows for the calculation of l/T, for Mg2+ bound at site I of 1610 s-l and a quadrupolar coupling constant X = 0.30 MHz. Titration of Mg2+ with enolase in the presence of 2-phosphoglycerate (PGA) and Zn2+, where Zn2+ binds specifically at site I, gives a l/T2 for Mg2+ bound at site II of 4000 s-l (X = 0.49 MHz). The Mg2+ at site II appears to be more anisotropic than Mg2+ at site I. The titration of site I of the enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex with Zn2+ or Mn2+ shows a simple displacement of the Mg2+. No paramagnetic effects by Mn2+ on "Mg relaxation were observed. Temperature studies of the 2sMg resonance show that fast exchange of the Mg2+ occurs under these conditions. From the lack of a paramagnetic effect, the distance between the cations at sites I and II must be more than 6-9 A. This distance limits the location, hence the function, of the cation at site II for catalytic activity. Titration of Mg2+ with PK gives a l/T2 for bound Mg2+ of 2200 s-i (X = 0.24 MHz). A titration of Mg2' with PK in the presence of the inhibitor oxalate gives a l/T, of 400 s-l. The temperature dependence of 2sMg relaxation in the PK-Mg-oxalate complex is consistent with slow exchange (E, = 6.1 + 1.6 kcal/ mol). The enzyme-bound cation is more tightly sequestered by the addition of a ligand that binds directly to the cation. An investigation of the 2sMg relaxation in the PK-Mn-oxalate-Mg-ATP complex, where the Mg2+ is bound to the nucleotide and the Mn2+ was enzyme bound, was not successful due to precipitation of PK under experimental conditions and the short T2 relaxation for 2sMg in this complex. The applications of 2sMg NMR have been useful in partially describing the properties of the bound Mg2+ in these two metal-requiring enzymes.

Magnesium is widely distributed in nature and its divalent ion, Mg'+, is involved in a large number of important physiological processes. Until recently, direct studies of the interaction of Mg2+ with biomolecules have been difficult for lack of good, direct spectroscopic probes. The development of 25Mg NMR as a spectroscopic tool by S. For&n and his colleagues has been well documented (1, 2). 25Mg NMR has recently been adapted as a useful spectroscopic tool in the study of Mg2+ interactions to macromolecules. 25Mg NMR studies of magnesium binding proteins can provide valuable information, such as pK, values for binding site ligands (3), binding constants and exchange rates for the Mg-protein complexes (4), and Mg2+ binding to genetically altered enzymes (5). The interaction of Mg2+ with calf thymus DNA using 25Mg NMR has been reported (6, 7). Enolase catalyzes the reversible dehydration reaction of the substrate D-(+)-2-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA)4 to yield PEP and water and requires a divalent cation for activity. Enolase isolated from yeast has been studied to the greatest degree (8). The enzyme is a symmetrical dimer of molecular weight 93,000 and the primary sequence has been determined by protein sequencing (9) and by gene sequencing (10). A refined X-ray structure has been published although the presence of only one cation site has been located (11). Each monomer of apoenzyme has a single binding site for the cation. In the presence of the substrate, there are up to three cation sites per monomer (12-14). The cation at site I, studied by NMR methods and using Mn2+, is responsible for the binding of the sub1 This research was supported by NIH Grant DK 17049. 2 Present address: Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.

strate and plays an important role in the departure of the hydroxyl group from the carbanion intermediate (15). Subsequent spectroscopic and kinetic studies, using Mg2+ as the activator, were interpreted as requiring the second cation site to be occupied for catalysis to occur (13, 16). Several direct roles for the second cation in the catalytic process were proposed implicitly, indicating that the second cation is also at the catalytic site (17). Models of the proposed mechanisms indicate that the two cations would be 7.5 to 9.5 A apart. Pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle has also been extensively studied. This enzyme also binds two cations at the catalytic site. The first cation binds to the enzyme and interacts directly with the substrate PEP or the yphosphate of ATP (18). A second cation is required for the formation of the M-ADP complex that serves as the substrate. These requirements have been shown using pyruvate deprotonation experiments (19) and steady state kinetics (20). The location of the enzyme-bound cation has been indicated from X-ray structure data (21). In this work, 25Mg NMR is used to study the interaction between Mg2+ and yeast enolase and between Mg2+ and rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. With enolase, Mn2+ and Mg2+ have been shown to preferentially occupy site I and site II, respectively, when PGA is saturating. There is little structural information about the relative location of these two metal binding sites. A lack of an observed spinspin interaction in the enolase-Mn-PGA-Mn complex indicates the cations are >12 A apart (22) and X-ray diffraction failed to observe a second bound cation (11). A study was made of the effect of the binding of Mg(I1) to enolase on the relaxation rates of 25Mg and of the interaction between two cation sites by measuring the paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ at site I on the relaxation rates of Mg 2+ at site II. In rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, there are also two divalent metal binding sites at the catalytic site. Kinetic data suggests that Mn2+ preferentially binds to the site on the enzyme while Mg2+ prefers the ATP site (20). The distance between two sites has been estimated to be closer than 10 A using Mn2+ EPR to measure spin coupling (23). The line broadening effect of pyruvate kinase on the relaxation rates of 25Mg was studied.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Enzyme assays. Assays for enolase activity were performed as described (24). Enolase concentration was determined by using the extinction coefficient (czso = 0.89 ml mg-' cm-i) (24) and the molecular weight of 93,000 per dimer (9). Pyruvate kinase activity was determined using the coupled enzyme assay described (20). Pyruvate kinase concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient (ezs,,= 0.54 ml mg-' cm-`) and the molecular weight of 237,060 per tetramer (25). Mn" binding to en&use by EPR. The binding of Mn2+ to enolase in the presence of 10 or 50 mM MgCls was determined using EPR spectroscopy. Free Mnx+ concentration was determined on a Varian E-9 Xband EPR spectrometer and the bound Mn2+ concentration was calculated. Experimental details are given in the figure legend A Scatchard plot (26) was used to quantitate the Mnx+ binding to the enolase-PGA complex in the presence of MgCl, . PGA binding to the enohe-Mns+-Mg2+ complex. Titration of PGA into the enolase complex that contains both Mn*+ and Mgx+ was performed by PRR measurements with a modified Seimco-pulsed NMR spectrometer operating at 24.3 MHz. The paramagnetic effect on the relaxation rate was measured from the difference in relaxation rates in the presence of the paramagnetic Mnx+ ion (l/T,,& and in the absence of the Mn2* (l/T,,,,). The l/Tm serves as the diamagnetic control. The enhancement of the complexes observed (c*) were calculated as the ratio of the paramagnetic effects in the presence of enolase (l/T;,) and the paramagnetic effects measured in the absence of enolase but under otherwise identical conditions (l/T,,).

The binding constant, Ks, and the final enhancement, cr, of the ternary enolase-Mn-PGA complex were obtained by the best fit of the data using the program devised by Reed et al. (27) and modified for use on the VAX 750. The treatment of the PRR data has been previously described (22). 25Mg NMR spectroscopy. The "Mg NMR spectra were obtained at 18.37 MHz using a Nicolet NT-300 NMR spectrometer. The MgCl, solutions were flushed with purified nitrogen gas for 5 min to minimize the presence of molecular oxygen prior to measuring spectra although this purging had no observable effect on the x6Mg spectra. The NMR samples were routinely prepared in 50% DxO for field-frequency locking. The sweep width was 3000 Hz and the dwell time was set at 167 msec. The 90" pulse was measured as 80 nsec and the 180' pulse was measured as 160 psec. No acoustic ringing was observed under these conditions and no extra deadtime was applied. The l/T, values were determined by the inversion recovery method (28) and l/T, values were determined either by the Hahn spin-echo method (29) or by measuring the line width at the half-maximal height,

Materials. Yeast enolase was purified from bakers' yeast as described (22). Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Hepes, Tris, Pipes, ATP, ADP, NADH, PEP, PGA (sodium salt), and oxalic acid were purchased from Sigma. The 85.8 atom% "Mg-enriched MgO was purchased from MSD Isotopes. %Mg-enriched MgCl* was prepared by dissolving %MgO in 1 M HCI. The resulting solution was neutralized with concentrated NaOH. The Mgx+ concentration was determined on a Varian 775 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Atomic absorption standards were purchased from Fisher Scientific. All other reagents were of the highest grade available. All solutions were made in deionized water.

where ri,z is the spectral width in hertz at half-maximal height and B is the artificial line broadening in hertz. The two methods of measurement give similar results. The effects of buffer, substrate, and enzyme concentration on the 1/ T, and/or l/T, values were determined. The l/T2 for the bound Mg2+ was calculated from the Swift-Connick relationship (30),

where l/a is the Mgs+ exchange rate from the ligand studied. This abbreviated form of the Swift-Connick equation is obtained when no changes in chemical shift are observed. No such changes in chemical

shift are observed with %Mg. [Mg], and [Mg]w were calculated using the total Mge+ concentration and dissociation constant for the respective enolase-Mg complexes (8). The quadrupolar splitting (X) for the bound Mg2+ was calculated from the relationship (31)

In Eq. [4], Z is the nuclear magnetic spin number (5/2 for %Mg), q is the asymmetry parameter (usually negligible in the calculation), te is the rotational correlation time, and w,, is the angular Larmor frequency of the nucleus in resonance. The value for f was estimated using the Stokes-Einstein-Debye equation, t, = 4?r#/3kT. (5)

In this equation, r is the radius of the molecule undergoing isotropic motion in a medium of viscosity 9, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature in kelvin. The dipolar distance, r between Mg2+ and the paramagnetic ion Mn2+ can be determined by measuring the paramagnetic effect, l/T,, of Mn2+ on the relaxation rates of %Mg using the shortened form of the SolomonBloembergen equation (32, 33) (Eq. [S]). r(in A) = C(pTl,f(~c))"6.

(6)

In Eq. [6], C is a collection of constants,p is the fraction of bound Mg2+ in the complex, and f (7.) is the correlation time function. In the case of the interaction between Mn2+ and "Mg, C is 318 8, s113and f (rc) is defined in Eq. [7]. 37, 77, f(7J = (1 + wtT2) + (1 + w,%,2) . The term 7, is the dipolar correlation time, w, is the Larmor precession frequency of the nuclear spin, and w, is the precession frequency of the electron spin (w, = 657 or). The temperature dependence of l/T, was studied from 4 to 25°C by using precooled N2 and heating the Nz to the desired temperature. The line widths were measured at three different relative peak heights of l/ 4, l/3, and l/2 of the maximal height at each temperature. These measurements were taken to check on possible peak distortions. For a nucleus with a spin of 5/2, the determination of T2 from the line width at half height can be misleading if the line shape of the signal is unknown or not Lorentzian (34).

The correlation time, tc for this dipolar interaction was assumed to be 1 nsec and the f (t,) was calculated for 18.37 MHz. Using the relationship given in Eq. [6], the calculation shows that the Mn2+-Mg2+ distance can be determined for up to 6-7 A (Fig. 1A). The maximum cation-cation distance that can be calculated (rmm) is dependent on the value for the correlation time t,. The values of t, for the Mn2+-water proton interaction in the various enolase-Mn2+-substrate complexes were measured by a frequency dependence of the PRR and are in the range of 3 to 6 nsec (15, 22). The values of tc for the Mn2+-31P interaction in the enolaseMn-Pi and enolase-Mn-F-Pi complexes were determined to be 9.01 and 5.83 nsec, respectively, from a frequency dependence of the relaxation rates (35). In the case of a Mn2+-Mg2+ interaction in the enolase-Mn2+-PGA-Mg2+ complex, the value for t, is believed to be in the same range as the t, values determined for other enolase-Mn2+ligand complexes (1 to 9 nsec). Figure 1B shows the relationship between r,, and t,. The vertical bars indicate calculated detection limits of r based on the ability to measure a 10% increase in relaxation rates caused by the addition of 0.1% of bound Mn2+. Calculations indicate that the Mn2+-Mg2+ distance can be measured up to 9.5 + 0.7 A depending on the value for tc. Mn2' Binding to Enolase-PGA in the Presence of High Concentrations of Mg2+ It has been shown that Mn2+ preferentially binds at site I of enolase in the presence of PGA and 1 mM Mg2+ (22). In the NMR experiments where 25Mg is being observed, approximately 10 mM Mg2+ is required for reasonable signal-to-noise. To determine the feasibility of investigating the effect of Mn2+ on the 25Mg resonance, the binding of Mn2+ by enolase under experimental conditions was determined. The binding of Mn2+ by enolase was measured in the presence of saturating PGA and 10 mM and also 50 mM Mg2+. A Scatchard plot of the binding data in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ is shown in Fig. 2. Only one Mn " binding site per subunit with a Kd of 102 + 20 PM was detected. When 50 mM MgC12 is present, less than 25% of the enolase site was occupied by Mn2+. Therefore, to perform a proper, quantitative series of experiments, 10 mM MgC12 could be used but 50 mM MgC12 is too high and would make the Mn2+ binding less selective and the analysis of the data more difficult. PRR Titration of PGA into the Enolase-Mn(II)Mg(II) Complex A series of PRR experiments were performed to determine the binding ability of PGA to the enolase complex that contains both Mg2+ and Mn'+. The PGA titration was performed at 24.3 MHz in the presence of 10 mM MgC12 and 40 pM MnC12. Under these conditions, Mn2+

RESULTS

The Relationship between the Mgzi-Mn2+ Dipolur Distance and the Paramagnetic Effect Elicited by Mn2+ on Mg2+ The relationship between the Mg'+--Mnzf dipole-dipole distance and the l/pTi, elicited by Mn2+, as measured by NMR methods, has been simulated for the enolase-Mn2+ligand-Mg2+ complex. The relationship between the paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on l/T1 of 25Mg and the Mn2+-Mg2+ distance was calculated using the modified version of the Solomon-Bloembergen equation (Eq. [6]).

FIG. 1. Relationship between the Mg2+ and Mnx+ dipolar distance and the paramagnetic effects elicited by Mn2+ on the l/T, of %Mg. (A) The relationship between the paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on the l/T, of %Mg at 18.37 MHz and the dipolar distances between the Mn2+ and "Mg were calculated. The value for 7, was assumed to be 1 X lo- s. The dotted line indicates the maximum distance and the minimum l/pT, reliably measurable with the criteria given in the text. (B) The relationship between the maximum Mnx+-Mg*+ distance estimated (r-) and te for the Mnx+-Mgx+ interaction was calculated. The f (t,) was calculated at 18.7 MHz. The error bars are estimated on the basis of maximal experimental deviations in relaxation rates and uncertainties in T, values.

binding studies show that site I is occupied (45%) by Mn2+ while site II is saturated with Mg2+. The measured enhancement of the enolase-Mn complex is plotted versus the PGA concentration in Fig. 3. A fit to the data shows that PGA binds to the enolase-Mn-Mg complex with a KS = 100 f 12 PM and has a final enhancement (Q) for the complex of 1.6 + 1.0. The PGA site is saturated with the addition of approximately 200 PM PGA. The PGA binds to enolase in the presence of 40 I.~M Mn2+ and 10 mM Mg2+ just as to enolase in the presence of only 40 PM Mn2+. In this latter case, Mn2+ clearly occupies only site I.

there may be a significant amount of free Mn2+ when MnC12 is added to enolase-Mg-PGA to form the enolaseMn-PGA-Mg complex. The effect of free Mn2+ on the relaxation rates of 11.2 mM 25Mg in Pipes buffer, pH 6.8, was measured. The values for l/Z', and l/T2 were similar to each other and did not change as MnClz was varied from 0 to 8 mM. There is no paramagnetic effect of free Mn2+ on the relaxation rates of 25Mg2+under these conditions. 25Mg NMR Spectra of Various Mg2+ Complexes A 25MgNMR spectrum of 11.2 mM MgC12 (85.8 atom% 25Mg enriched) in 50% D20 was obtained at 18.37 MHz on a Nicolet NT-300 NMR spectrometer (Fig. 4A). The chemical shift of this resonance was assigned as 0 ppm. When enolase was added into the Mg2+ solution, the resulting 25Mg NMR spectrum showed line broadening but no difference in chemical shift (Fig. 4B). The line broadening effect caused by addition of enolase was greater in the presence of PGA than in its absence (Fig. 4C). Most of the 25Mg NMR spectra were obtained with between 400 and 2000 acquisitions.

Effects of Buffer and Free Mn2+ on 25Mg Relaxation The l/Z', and l/T2 values for 25Mg in a sample of 11.2 mM MgC12 (85.8 atom% enriched) in 50% D20 at pH 7.0 were 7.0 and 7.5 s-l, respectively. The relaxation rates were similar and gave the same results in Pipes buffer, pH 6.8, or Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, and from 50 mM MgCl, extrapolated to 0 mM MgC12 (data not shown). These results indicate that the relaxation rates do not depend on these buffers nor on MgClz concentration and that these Effect of Erwlase on the Relaxation Rates of 25Mg buffers can be used with no artifactual interference. The Kd for Mn2+ in the enolase-Mn-PGA complex in The l/T2 for 25Mgincreased linearly upon the addition the presence of 10 mM MgC12 is 102 PM, indicating that of enolase as shown in Fig. 5.

1MNll) lb I [ enryme 1: FIG. 2. Mn2+ binding to the enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex. The binding of Mn2+ to enolase was measured by EPR spectroscopy in the presence of 50 mM Pipes, pH 6.8,50 mM KCl, 2.22 mM PGA, and 102 pM enolase sites. The solutions also contained 10 mM MgCI, (IZI) or 50 mM MgCl* (+). The line is calculated with a fit of Kd = 102 + 20 pM and n = 2.0 f 0.2 (El).

constant, X, using Eq. [4]. The calculated values for X are 0.30 MHz for Mg2+ at site I (enolase-Mg2+ complex) and 0.49 MHz for the Mg2+ at site II in the presence of PGA and Zn2+ (enolase-Zn-PGA-Mg complex). If the enolaseMg and the enolase-Zn-PGA-Mg complexes have the same correlation time, the increase in ( 1/T2)boundfor Mg2+ in the latter complex indicates a greater quadrupole coupling constant, thus a greater asymmetry in electronic environment of Mg2+ at site II in the quaternary complex compared to Mg2+ at site I in the binary complex. In order to determine the effect of Mg2+ binding to enolase at both site I and site II, the l/T2 for Mg2+ in the presence of PGA was measured with increasing addition of enolase. The binding of Mg2+ to both sites requires the presence of PGA. The l/T2 increased linearly as enolase was added to a solution of Mg2+ and PGA (Fig. 5). In the experiments performed, all the enolase added is saturated with Mg2+ at both sites. The calculated value for (l/ T&mnd was 4290 + 400 s-l. This value results from Mg2+ binding at both sites. The (1/T2)bmd for Mg2+ at both sites (4290 s-`) is similar to the (1/T2)bound for Mg2+ at site II in the presence of Zn2+ at site I (4000 s-l) indicating that the (1/T2h,und for Mg2+ at site I might be relatively small in the enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex. The l/T, of 25Mg measured by the inversion recovery method was similar to l/T2 of 25Mg in the same complex,

conditions, all the added enolase binds Mg2+. The l/T2 values were measured as a function of enzyme concentration and the value for l/T2 of bound Mg2+ was calculated, using Eq. [3] based on 1/T2,0bsewed and the concentration of enolase-Mg, to be 1510 + 150 s-l. This observed effect of enolase on l/T, occurs from the binding of Mg2+ at site I of enolase. To determine the l/T, for Mg2+ at site II of enolase that is occupied in the presence of PGA, the complex that contained enolase-Zn'+-PGA-Mg2+ was formed (Fig. 5). This was achieved by titrating enolase-Zn-PGA into a solution containing Mg2+, Zn2+, and PGA. The Zn2' preferentially binds at site I while Mg2+ binds at site II under these conditions (22). The l/T, for 25Mg increased linearly with the addition of enolase-Zn-PGA. Under these conditions, all the enolase was as the enolase-Zn-PGA-Mg complex. The value for (1/T2)i,,,"nd was calculated from the observed l/T2 and the concentration of bound Mg2+ (Eq. [3]) and gave a value of 4000 f 420 s-l. This relaxation rate results from Mg2+ binding at site II in the presence of Zn2+ at site I. The (1/T2hound for Mg2+ at site II in the presence of Zn2+ at site I (4000 s-l) is considerably greater than the value for (1/T2)bound for Mg2+ at site I (1510 s-l). The radius of the enolase dimer, calculated from sedimentation data, is 36.2 A (8). This radius leads to a calculation of a rotational correlation time, T,, of 4.88 X 10e8 s. These data allow for the calculation of the quadrupolar coupling

Effects of Zn2' and Mn2+ on the 25Mg Relaxation in the Enoluse-Zn-PGA-Mg and EnolaseMn-PGA-Mg Complexes

Rates

In order to determine the paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on the relaxation rates of enolase-bound 25Mg, Mn2+ was titrated into a solution containing the enolase-Mg-PGAMg complex. Under experimental conditions, Mn2+ preferentially displaces Mg 2+ at site I as observed by EPR binding studies [ (22); Fig. 21. This results in the formation of the enolase-Mn-PGA-Mg complex. Any paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on the relaxation rates of 25Mg results from the interaction between Mn2+ at site I and the Mg2+ at site II. The addition of a diamagnetic cation, Zn2+, that also specifically binds at site I was investigated in order to serve as a control for effects by a simple cation displacement at site I. When MnClz was added into the enolase-Mg-PGAMg complex, the observed value for l/T2 decreased. The concentration of free Mn2+ that gives a half-maximal decrease in l/T, (K&) was 67 f 5 PM (Fig. 6). The K& value was similar to the Kd value for Mn2+ binding to the enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex as determined by EPR (102 + 20 PM). When Mn2+ was saturated at site I, the l/T,

value was about 50% of the value measured when Mg2+ binds to both sites on enolase. This indicates that the added Mnzf replaces a fraction but not all of Mg2+ that is bound to enolase. A similar experiment titrating the diamagnetic cation Zn2+ into the enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex was also performed and the results show a similar effect on l/T2 with a K& of 4 f 2 PM (Fig. 6). Zn2+ gives a lower value for K& than does Mn2+ since Zn2+ has a higher aflinity for site I of enolase (22). When the diamagnetic cation Zn2+ was saturated at site I, the observed l/T, value was similar to the value observed with a saturating amount of the paramagnetic cation, Mn2+. Extrapolation of the l/T2 effects to infinite concentrations of Zn2+ or Mn2+ give values of 30 + 2 and 32 f 2 s-l, respectively. This indicates that there is no paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ at site I on the relaxation rates of Mg 2+ at site II.5 The two cations are thus more than 6-9 A apart. Temperature Dependence of 25Mg Relaxation in Various En&se Complexes Containing Mg2' The line widths at half peak height of 25Mg spectra measured for the various Mg2+ complexes were measured as the sample temperature was varied from 4 to 25'C. The measured line widths are shown as a function of inverse temperature in Fig. 7. A decrease in the line widths is observed as the temperature is increased. This negative temperature dependence indicates that the Mg-PGA, enolase-Mg, and enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complexes are in fast chemical exchange. The 25Mg signals observed are the average of free and bound Mg2+. The positive slopes are consistent with relaxation and not chemical exchange and the calculated activation energies for Mg2+ relaxation were 1.95 + 0.78 kcal/mol for the enolase-Mg complex and 0.98 + 0.59 kcal/mol for the enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex. These low activation energy barriers are consistent with the activation energy for the rotation of the protein complex. The temperature dependencies of the l/T2 of enolaseMn-PGA-Mg and enolase-Zn-PGA-Mg complexes were also studied to determine if the observed effects are dominated either by nuclear relaxation or by chemical exchange. The l/T, values were almost identical for both complexes and did not change with increasing temperatures (no temperature dependence). These results indicate a fast exchange in both complexes and no paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on the relaxation rates of "Mg.

Effects of ATP and Oxalate on the Relaxation Rates of 25Mg Kinetic and EPR studies with muscle pyruvate kinase have shown that Mn2+ preferentially interacts with the enzyme while Mg2+ is more selective in interacting with the substrate ADP (20, 23). Thus, there appears to be a dual function for divalent cations with this enzyme and both ions interact in the catalytic site. Lodato and Reed (23), using Mn2+ at both cation sites, have estimated that these two sites are less than 10 A apart based on the observed spin-spin interactions measured by EPR spectroscopy. Thus the interaction between enzyme-bound Mn2+ and nucleotide-bound Mg2+ at the catalytic site of pyruvate kinase was attempted by 25Mg NMR. A complex that is amenable for study is the pyruvate kinase-Mn-oxalate-ATP-Mg complex where Mn2+ is bound to the enzyme and Mg2+ is bound to ATP (23). Oxalate serves as a transition state analog of the enolate of pyruvate (36). The effects of the substrate ATP and the competitive inhibitor oxalate on the relaxation rates of 25Mgwere studied. The l/T2 of 25Mgincreases linearly with concentration of ATP and with oxalate as they are each titrated into a solution of MgC12. The values for (l/ T2)bound were calculated using a Kd of 140 PM for the formation of Mg-ATP (37) and a Kd of 1.7 mM for the formation of Mg-oxalate (35). The calculated values for (l/ T&md for the Mg2+ in the Mg-ATP and Mg-oxalate complexes are 660 and 127 s-l, respectively.

Effect of Pyruvate Kinase on the Relaxation Rates of 25Mg To determine the effect of Mg2+ binding to pyruvate kinase on the relaxation rates of 25Mg, the l/T2 for a solution of Mg2+ was measured as pyruvate kinase was increased. The addition of pyruvate kinase to a solution of Mg2+ or Mg-oxalate gave a linear increase in l/T2 (Fig. 8). The l/T2 for Mg2+ in the PK-Mg complex was calculated to be 2200 + 270 s-l and the l/T2 for Mg2+ in the PK-Mg-oxalate complex was 400 it_ 30 s-r using Eq. [3]. The low value of l/T2 in the PK-Mg-oxalate complex appears to be due to slow exchange. A measure of the l/ T2 of these two complexes as a function of temperature gives a positive temperature dependence (Fig. 9) with an activation energy, E, of 2.1 + 0.9 kcal/mol for the binary PK-Mg complex and 6.1 +- 1.6 kcal/mol for the ternary PK-Mg-oxalate complex. The results suggest that, as expected, Mg 2+ binds more tightly to the ternary complex and is in slow exchange whereas Mg2+ exchanges more rapidly from the binary PK-Mg complex. From the value

Attempts to determine the paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on the Mg2+ relaxation in the PK-Mn-oxalate-Mg-ATP complex were not successful. Under experimental conditions (lo-12 mM MgC12, 1.3 mM ATP, 0.1 mM oxalate, 0.1 M KCl, 50 mM Pipes, pH 6.&J), the enzyme rapidly precipitates and loses activity. Precipitation induced additional line broadening, precluding T2 measurements. The activity of rabbit muscle PK in the presence of 5 mM MgC12 was found to decrease by 50% after 20 h at room temperature. ATP or oxalate did not protect from loss of activity at 5 mM MgC12. In the presence of 2 mM MgC12 the enzyme retained 80% activity after 48 h at room temperature. The presence of ATP and oxalate, at 2 mM MgC12 gave additional protection against inactivation. DISCUSSION The results presented in this manuscript demonstrate applications of 25Mg NMR to study the interactions of Mg2+ with Mg2+-requiring enzymes. Some limitations of the methods were also found. A relatively high concentration of MgC12 (10 mM 25Mg enriched) is required for good signal to noise. Therefore, it is necessary to determine if the enzyme retains normal stability and behavior under experimental conditions. The enzyme activity, stability of enzyme activity, and binding affinity for other ligands must be determined at experimental concentrations of MgC12. The application of 25Mg to enzyme systems can also be useful when there are two cation binding sites per monomer and if there is selectivity in cation binding for the two sites. The examples presented in this study are with the two enzymes, yeast enolase and muscle pyruvate kinase, that have selective binding for Mn2+ and Mg2+ at different sites. The ability to measure 25Mg spectra for enzyme-Mg complexes that are in rapid exchange also allows the possibility of measuring the dipolar interaction between the bound Mg2+ and a paramagnetic center such as a bound Mn2+ that may bind at a separate and distinct site on the enzyme. The limitation of the dipole-dipole distance that can be measured, if Mn2+ is the paramagnetic center, depends upon the correlation time for the dipolar interaction. If the value for T, varies from 1 to 10 ns, the upper limits of the dipolar distance that can be detected are from about 6.5 to 9.5 A. Thus, the limitations of this application are to bimetallic enzyme systems where the two cation sites can be selectively occupied and where the cation sites are in close proximity. There is one Mn2+ binding site per enolase monomer with a Kd of 102 + 20 pM in the presence of 10 mM MgC12 and saturating PGA as determined using EPR. This is the apparent binding constant for Mn2+ expected at site I in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ when Mn2+ and Mg2+ are mutually competitive for that site (22). A PRR titration with PGA of enolase that contains Mg2+ and Mn2+

shows that PGA binds to the enolase-(Mn + Mg), where the concentration of MgCl, is 10 mM, with a Kd of 100 f 5 pM. This indicates that even in the presence of a high concentration of MgC12, enolase selectively binds Mn2+ at site I where PGA interacts with the bound Mn2+ with the same affinity as in the absence of Mg2+. These findings made it possible to investigate appropriate Mg2+-containing complexes of yeast enolase by 25Mg NMR with Mn2+ as a paramagnetic probe. The quadrupolar coupling constants for bound Mg2+ at each site shows a smaller value (X = 0.30 MHz) at site I than at site II (X = 0.49 MHz), indicating that the electronic environment of the Mg2+ is more anisotropic at site II. The Mg2+ binds more tightly and selectively to this site than to site I, in contrast to Mn2+, which shows the opposite selectivity in binding (22). Both cation sites can be occupied by Mn2+ or Mg2+ only in the presence of PGA. The differences in anisotropy of the Mg2+ at site I and at site II are consistent with CD data with Co-enolase and Ni-enolase (38) and with EPR data for Cu-enolase (39) that indicate the cations at the two different sites are in octahedral and distorted octahedral environments. Occupancy of Mg2+ at both sites I and II shows an increase in the observed (1/T2)bound, indicating that the sites are not exchanging and the quadrupolar effects are approximately independent of each other. The titration of Zn2+ into the quaternary enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex results in a hyperbolic decrease in the observed l/T, of 25Mg, indicating that the Zn2+ displaces Mg2+ from site I of the complex. A quantitation of the concentration of Zn2+ added that results in half maximal decrease in 1/T2,0bsewed gives an apparent dissociation constant for Zn2+ of 4 pM. A similar experiment performed by the titration of the quaternary enolase-Mg-PGA-Mg complex with Mn2+ also results in a decrease in the observed l/T2 of 25Mg, similar to the observation using diamagnetic Zn2+. The lack of a paramagnetic effect by the bound Mn2+ on the l/T2 of 25Mg indicates that if the Mg2+ is in rapid exchange, then the two cations bound at sites I and II, respectively, are greater than 6.5-9.5 A apart from one another. This conclusion is consistent with the results obtained from a frequency dependence of PRR for the enolase-Mn, enolase-Mn-PGA, enolase-Mn-PGA-Mn and enolase-Mn-PGA-Mg complexes (22). There was no evidence for any spin-spin coupling of the two Mn2+ ions in the quaternary complex. These results are in contrast with earlier reports of spin-spin coupling of enolase-Mn complexes as measured in the frozen state using EPR spectroscopy (39). Those studies were performed at 77°K in the absence of PGA. The observation of spin exchange was made when the ratio of Mn2+/enolase sites exceeded one. In the absence of PGA only a single Mn2+ site per subunit exists on enolase (12,22). The spin exchange may have occurred due to nonspecific adsorption of Mn2+ on the enzyme surface at this low temperature. Reed has

recently observed spin-spin coupling of Mn2+ in an enolase complex containing a substrate analog in contrast to earlier observations from that laboratory.6 A study of the line widths of the %Mg resonance in the various enolasecomplexes as a function of temperature gave results consistent with conditions of rapid exchange for each complex. When the line widths were measured at three different heights, the temperature dependencies of the line widths were similar regardless of where the line width was measured. This observation indicates that the %Mg resonance gives a Lorentzian line shape and l/T2 can be measured from the line width at half-maximum height (6). When l/T2 values were measured from line widths and from spin echo measurements, the same values were obtained. Titration of pyruvate kinase into MgC12 to make the PK-Mg complex showed an increase in line broadening of 2200 + 270 s-l. This corresponds giving a WT2)bd to a quadrupole coupling constant (X) of 0.24 MHz (t, for PK was calculated as 1.26 X 10e7s). In contrast, titration of Mg2+ into PK in the presence of oxalate did not change the observed l/T2 very dramatically. This is due to the tighter binding of Mg2+ to PK in the presence of oxalate. A temperature dependence of the 25Mgspectrum from the PK-Mg-oxalate complex indicates that the bound Mg2+ in the PK-Mg-oxalate complex is in slow exchange with Mg2+ in bulk solution. The upper limit for the rate of dissociation (k,,) was 421 + 40 s-l and the energy of activation (E,) for Mg2+ exchange is 6.1 + 1.6 kcal/mol. In the presence of a high concentration of oxalate and ATP, the relaxation rates were too fast to determine with any certainty. This is, in large part, due to the presence of oxalate-Mg and ATP-Mg complexes. This and the slow exchange of bound Mg2+ preclude additional characterization of the PK complexes. Although the binary complex can be characterized, under experimental conditions where high concentrations of MgC12are necessary, PK is inactivated and precipitates. Although this phenomenon has not been previously described, to the best of our knowledge, previous experiments have not been performed under such high concentrations of enzyme and MgC12. The presence of ligands that bind cations tightly form competing complexes and increase the difficulties in quantitating the results of these experiments.
