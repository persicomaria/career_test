Crystallographic analysis of the specific yet versatile recognition of distinct nuclear localization signals by karyopherin 
Elena Conti1,2* and John Kuriyan1
Background: Karyopherin  (importin ) is an adaptor molecule that recognizes proteins containing nuclear localization signals (NLSs). The prototypical NLS that is able to bind to karyopherin  is that of the SV40 T antigen, and consists of a short positively charged sequence motif. Distinct classes of NLSs (monopartite and bipartite) have been identified that are only partly conserved with respect to one another but are nevertheless recognized by the same receptor. Results: We report the crystal structures of two peptide complexes of yeast karyopherin  (Kap): one with a human c-myc NLS peptide, determined at 2.1 Å resolution, and one with a Xenopus nucleoplasmin NLS peptide, determined at 2.4 Å resolution. Analysis of these structures reveals the determinants of specificity for the binding of a relatively hydrophobic monopartite NLS and of a bipartite NLS peptide. The peptides bind Kap in its extended surface groove, which presents a modular array of tandem binding pockets for amino acid residues. Conclusions: Monopartite and bipartite NLSs bind to a different number of amino acid binding pockets and make different interactions within them. The relatively hydrophobic monopartite c-myc NLS binds extensively at a few binding pockets in a similar manner to that of the SV40 T antigen NLS. In contrast, the bipartite nucleoplasmin NLS engages the whole array of pockets with individually more limited but overall more abundant interactions, which include the NLS two basic clusters and the backbone of its non-conserved linker region. Versatility in the specific recognition of NLSs relies on the modular

Introduction
Cellular activities in the nucleus and the cytosol of eukaryotic cells are coordinated by a continuous exchange of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. Nuclear proteins and RNAs are shuttled from their site of synthesis to their final destination by an active and selective mechanism that is mediated by signal-dependent binding to specific and saturable receptors [1­3]. The first nuclear import pathway to be discovered, referred to as the `classical' pathway, relies on the recognition by transport proteins of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) presented by the nuclear protein to be translocated. The NLS receptor is a cytosolic  heterodimer known as karyopherin or importin [4­8]. Karyopherin  (Kap) is the saturable component of the receptor and binds the NLScontaining cargo in an energy-independent manner [9­11]. Kap is the carrier component of the receptor, which docks the complex to the nuclear pore and translocates it to the nucleus [7,8]. Upon reaching the nucleoplasmic side, the two karyopherin subunits are dissociated via the direct interaction of the  subunit with the small GTPase Ran [12,13]. As a result, the  subunit and the NLS-containing

nuclear protein are released to the nucleoplasm, whereas the  subunit accumulates at the nuclear envelope. After releasing its NLS cargo, the  subunit is recycled back to the cytoplasm via an active and specific nuclear export pathway that involves a  homologue receptor [14]. Many nuclear proteins are imported via the classical import pathway. A number of similar but independent pathways, however, have been characterized for the import of ribosomal and mRNA-binding proteins and for the export of Kap and RNAs (see reviews [1­3]). These transport pathways mostly rely on the direct interaction of the target macromolecule with a  homologue receptor, which mediates both saturable cargo binding and translocation through the nuclear pore complex. In contrast, the classical import pathway requires Kap as an adaptor protein to bind NLSs. NLSs are sequence motifs that are sufficient for targeting their respective proteins to the nucleus. Proteins that are normally restricted to the cytoplasm can be imported to the nucleus if fused to an NLS motif [15]. NLSs are not cleaved after entry into the nucleus and can be found anywhere within a protein sequence. NLS motifs lack a

stringent consensus sequence, although they are generally short stretches of amino acids that contain a high proportion of positively charged residues [16]. The importance of basic residues in nuclear import was first established with the extensive characterization of the NLS in the SV40 T antigen polypeptide [17,18]. The SV40 T antigen NLS consists of seven residues, five of which are basic (126PKKKRKV132, in single-letter amino acid code). Despite the apparently non-descript repetition of positively charged amino acids in the signal, point mutations identified one particular lysine residue (Lys128) as essential, and the adjacent residues were found to be either less critical or in one case even dispensable [19]. These differences in the relative importance of individual basic residues in the motif suggested that the receptor imposes particular structural requirements on the NLS that cannot be satisfied by the simple juxtaposition of positive charges. As more NLSs were identified, it became apparent that those that are monopartite and defined by the presence of a short single stretch of contiguous positively charged residues are in fact an exception. More than 50% of nuclear proteins contain a sequence that fits a longer bipartite NLS motif [16]. Bipartite NLSs are approximately 18 amino acids in length with two clusters of basic residues separated by a linker, as italicised in the nucleoplasmin sequence 155KRPAATKKAGQAKKKKLD172 [20,21]. The larger downstream basic cluster resembles a monopartite NLS, but is not sufficient by itself to target a protein to the nucleus. It requires a smaller upstream cluster separated by a linker of 10­12 residues with variable sequence. Strikingly in this context, the c-myc proto-oncogene is directed to the nucleus by a short peptide (320PAAKRVKLD328) that contains even fewer positively charged residues than the typical downstream cluster of a bipartite NLS [22]. In contrast to the SV40 NLS, the c-myc NLS requires the presence of hydrophobic residues at certain positions [23]. The determinants for the specific recognition of a canonical monopartite NLS were elucidated when the crystal structure of the NLS-binding domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae karyopherin  (Kap50) was determined in a complex with the nuclear targeting signal of the SV40 T antigen [24]. Kap50 consists of the 50 kDa C-terminal portion of the full-length molecule. It lacks the importin -binding (IBB) N-terminal domain [25], which contains an autoinhibitory segment [26]. Kap50 is an elongated molecule consisting of ten helical repeats known as armadillo (ARM) motifs. Each ARM motif has an approximate triangular crosssection and is characterized by three  helices. Two  helices (H1 and H2) form the convex outer surface of the molecule, and the third (H3) forms its concave portion. The concave surface of Kap is shaped into a shallow and extended groove, which is lined by a ladder of conserved tryptophan and asparagine residues and surrounded by

acidic amino acids. This arrangement results in an array of binding sites that combine hydrophobic and electrostatic elements to recognize the positively charged residues of the SV40 NLS specifically. Kap is able to recognize not only the monopartite SV40 T antigen NLS, but also the more hydrophobic c-myc NLS as well as the longer bipartite nucleoplasmin NLS. Despite the diversity in its targets, however, Kap is not indiscriminate because many sequences that are only slightly different from active NLS motifs are not recognized. To address the structural basis for the versatile specificity of Kap we have determined the crystal structures of the yeast Kap50 in complex with two distinct NLS-containing peptides: a human c-myc NLS peptide in which hydrophobic residues play an important role, and a Xenopus nucleoplasmin peptide that contains a bipartite NLS.

Results and discussion
Structure determination

Initial attempts at the co-crystallization of Kap50 with peptides corresponding to the sequence of the c-myc NLS or to that of the nucleoplasmin NLS were unsuccessful. Furthermore, in contrast to the short SV40 T antigen NLS, neither of the peptides used in this study could be soaked productively into the native Kap50 crystals [24]. Inspection of the Kap50 structure suggested that the inability to soak most peptides into this crystal form was perhaps because of the substrate-binding site of Kap50 being partially occluded by the formation of a dimeric structure. To prevent the dimerization of Kap50 we engineered a point mutation (TyrAsp at position 397, Y397D). In the native crystal form, a central element of the intermolecular interface is a hydrophobic interaction between the sidechains of the conserved Tyr397 residue and its symmetry mate at the local twofold of the Kap50 homodimer. Mutation of residue 397 from tyrosine to aspartic acid is expected to destabilize the homodimer. Although residue 397 is buried in the crystallographic dimer, it would be exposed to solvent in the monomeric form and the mutation is therefore unlikely to alter the mainchain conformation to a significant extent. The Y397D Kap50 mutant was expressed better in bacterial cells than the wild-type protein was and showed improved solubility properties in crystallization experiments. Co-crystals with a c-myc NLS and a nucleoplasmin NLS peptide were obtained using the vapor diffusion method with polyethylene glycol as the precipitating agent, with different additives and pH conditions. The c-myc NLS­Kap50 crystals are in space group P21 and diffract X-rays to 2.1 Å resolution, and the nucleoplasmin NLS­Kap50 crystals are in space group C2 and diffract to 2.4 Å resolution. Both structures were determined using molecular replacement, using the native Kap50 model. The models are currently refined to free and

working R values of 27.7% and 24.6% respectively for the c-myc complex, and 26.5% and 24.1% respectively for the nucleoplasmin complex.
Overall architecture and conformational flexibility

The overall structure of the Y397D mutant of yeast Kap50 is quite similar to that of the wild-type protein and of the mouse homologue reported previously [24,26]. The molecule presents an extended surface groove lined by a set of conserved residues, notably a set of solvent-exposed tryptophan and asparagine residues. Each Trp­Asn pair is contributed by one ARM motif. The tryptophan residues occupy a conserved position in the H3 helices of each ARM motif and the asparagine residues are located one helical turn downstream from the tryptophan residues. This arrangement creates an array of Trp­Asn pairs positioned at regular intervals along the surface groove. The regularity of the Trp­Asn ladder is interrupted in the fifth and sixth ARM motifs by the presence of an arginine and a tyrosine residue at the corresponding positions. There is a small but significant change in the overall shape of the Kap50 molecule in complex with the c-myc or nucleoplasmin NLS peptides when compared with that of the SV40 T antigen NLS complex (Figure 1a). The overall root mean square deviations (rmsd) in C positions are 1.6 Å and

The C backbones of Kap in the c-myc complex (shown in blue) and in the nucleoplasmin NLS complex (shown in purple) have been globally superposed to that of the SV40 T antigen NLS complex (shown in white). Although the overall structure of Kap in the complexes is the same, some flexibility of the ARM repeats at the N- and C-terminal portion of the molecule is observed upon binding of different NLSs. The figure was created using the program RIBBONS [46]. (b) Comparison of the NLS peptide-binding sites. The c-myc NLS peptide (blue) and the nucleoplasmin NLS peptide (purple) are shown after a global protein superposition to Kap (green) in a complex with the SV40 T antigen NLS (white). The peptide backbones closely superpose at the large and small binding sites at the N and C termini of the protein, respectively. The mutated residue (Y397D) used to obtain the c-myc and nucleoplasmin co-crystals of Kap is shown in yellow.

1.1 Å, respectively. In these global comparisons, the central repeats (ARM 4­8) superpose closely with an rmsd of about 0.7 Å. In contrast, the three N-terminal and the two C-terminal ARM repeats deviate with an average rotation of 6° and 5°, respectively. A larger global deviation of 3.1 Å is obtained from the comparison of the c-myc and nucleoplasmin structures; a rotation of 6.4° in this case relates the N-terminal ARM repeats, and ARM 9 and 10 deviate by 9.8°. The overall difference in the structure of Kap50 between the c-myc and nucleoplasmin complexes is larger than that observed when comparing the yeast and mouse Kap proteins in the SV40 complex and in the autoinhibited form, respectively [26]. The conformational differences appear to be caused by peptide binding more than by crystal packing. Such flexibility is the product of small additive changes that propagate along the polypeptide chain, and results in a more or less open structure.
General features of peptide binding

The c-myc and nucleoplasmin NLS peptides bind along the spine of the surface groove in an almost fully extended conformation (Figure 1b). Their mainchains run in the opposite direction to that of the protein, with the NLS N termini bound to the C-terminal region of Kap50 and their C termini to the N-terminal region.

The point mutation engineered in Kap50 appears to not influence peptide binding. The aspartate sidechain at position 397 (which replaces the tyrosine found in the wild-type protein) points into solvent. It is 16 Å from the nearest atom of the NLS peptide and is unlikely to alter the affinity of NLS binding significantly. Two copies of the monopartite NLS of human c-myc (residues 320­328) bind yeast Kap50 at two sites, as was the case for the single SV40 T antigen targeting signal [24]. A large site is present in the N-terminal half of the molecule and is characterized by three Trp­Asn pairs (at ARM 2­4), whereas two such pairs line a small site in the C-terminal half (at ARM 7 and 8). The bipartite NLS (residues 155­170) of Xenopus nucleoplasmin spans the whole surface groove between the small and the large sites defined for monopartite NLSs as indeed predicted [24,27], and it additionally interacts with the central fifth and sixth ARM repeats. The `backbones' of the monopartite and bipartite peptides are closely superimposable at the large and small sites. The deviation in the C positions of the nucleoplasmin residues 165­170 and the c-myc residues 320­326 is 1.1 Å. At the small site, the superposition of three  carbon atoms of the bipartite NLS (155­157) with the corresponding ones of c-myc (323­325) results in an rmsd of 0.7 Å. The detailed set of polar and hydrophobic interactions exploited by the peptides at the binding pockets is, however, not identical (Figure 2), and is tailored to the requirements of their distinctive sequence. For consistency with the notation used previously for the SV40 T antigen NLS recognition, the binding pockets will be referred to as P and P at the large and small site, respectively.
c-myc NLS recognition

the c-myc NLS, the basic residue at P5 forms an intramolecular salt bridge with the Asp328 residue of the peptide at P7 (Figure 2a). The hydrophobic residues at P4 and P6 fit into apolar areas on the surface of the protein, which are not immediately surrounded by acidic residues. At P1, the sidechain of Ala322 points in the same direction as Lys323, as is the case for the autoinhibitory segment of mouse Kap but not for the SV40 NLS complex, in which a lysine residue points in the opposite direction and occupies the P1 pocket. It is unclear whether the differences observed at the P1 site in the SV40 structure are genuine or altered by the presence of a crystallographic dimer interface near this region. A smaller additional binding site for the NLS is present in the C-terminal half of Kap at the Trp­Asn pairs of ARM 7 and ARM 8 (W363­N367, W405­N409 pairs) where two contiguous positively charged residues occupy the P1 and P2 pockets (Figure 2a). Although the binding of the c-myc peptide to this small site might not be physiologically relevant, the site reveals a set of polar and hydrophobic interactions that are similar to those observed earlier in the case of the SV40 T antigen NLS, which had led us to speculate the importance of the dual binding sites in bipartite NLS binding [24,27].
Nucleoplasmin NLS recognition

Well-defined high-resolution electron density (Figure 3a) marks the recognition of the human c-myc NLS (320PAAKRVKLD328) at the seven binding pockets that shape the large site of Kap50 (Figure 3b). The central portion of the c-myc NLS (323KRVKL327) binds in an extended conformation from the P2 to the P6 pocket (Figure 2a). The tryptophan and asparagine sidechains of the third and second ARM motifs (W195­N199, W153­N157 pairs) bind the peptide mainchain by fully satisfying its hydrogen-bonding potential at the P3 and P5 positions. The third Trp­Asn pair at the large site (W237­N241) interacts only partially with the NLS mainchain, which deviates from a -strand conformation with a sharp bend at residue Ala322. The PAA tripeptide (residues 320­322) is anchored by a hydrogen-bonding interaction of its N-terminal proline residue to a conserved arginine sidechain. The sidechains of the three positively charged residues of the NLS protrude into the P2, P3 and P5 pockets and are involved in interactions that are similar to those observed in the binding of the SV40 T antigen NLS [24]. In the case of

The bipartite NLS (154VKRPAATKKAGQAKKKKLD172) of Xenopus nucleoplasmin binds along the surface groove of Kap50 with the upstream basic cluster (residues 155­156) at the small site and the downstream basic cluster (residues 167­170) at the large site. The electron density and the monotonic increase in B factors from the N terminus to the C terminus of the NLS suggest more prominent binding of the upstream cluster and of the linker rather than of the larger downstream cluster (Figure 4a). The peptide is recognized in a mostly extended conformation with two short turns, one of them (157PAAT160 residues) following the smaller cluster and the other (163AGQA166 residues) preceding the larger one (Figure 4b). Despite the fact that the peptide used was longer than the characterized NLS motif, only the latter is ordered in the structure. The recognition of the KKKK downstream cluster of nucleoplasmin at the large site is mediated by fewer interactions than those established in the same area by the c-myc or SV40 T antigen monopartite NLSs (Figure 2b). The sidechains at P2 and P3 are well defined in the electron density, and exploit some but not all of the binding properties at the corresponding pockets. Conversely, poor electron density and no sidechain interactions are detected at P4 and P5. The C-terminal 171LD172 segment is disordered, in contrast to the structure of the c-myc complex in which the same sequence at the same position is well ordered and participates in contacts at the P6 and P7 pockets. Similarly, the detailed interactions engaging the KR upstream cluster of nucleoplasmin at the small site are

conserved residues interrupt the regularity of the Trp­Asn array at the fifth and sixth ARM repeats (W279­Y283, R321­N325 pairs) and their function in nuclear import had, so far, been unclear. The nucleoplasmin GQA sequence occupies the P1 pocket in a conformation similar to that adopted by the c-myc PAA tripeptide. In contrast to the extensive mainchain interactions, the sidechain interactions of the linker amino acids are scarce and limited to the Lys161 residue, possibly in a species-dependent manner.
NLS structural determinants

The crystal structure of the c-myc complex shows many of the central features that had been described previously for the highly basic SV40 T antigen monopartite NLS [24]. Most probably the physiological recognition occurs at the large site, where the c-myc peptide binds with all of its nine amino acids, whereas the simultaneous binding of a partial peptide sequence at the small site is probably because of the high concentration of NLS peptide present in the co-crystallization experiments. One lysine residue (323) appears to play a crucial role in the nuclear localization signal of the c-myc NLS; it is engaged in extensive interactions at the P2 site. The essential PAA segment occupies the P1 pocket, taking full advantage of its hydrophobic character and curved shape. The LD dipeptide that had been shown to be important in mutagenesis studies [23] stabilizes the P5 residue by neutralizing its charge intramolecularly. The crystal structure of the nucleoplasmin complex bears out all the characteristics of bipartite NLSs predicted by Dingwall and Laskey several years ago [16]. A large surface area with the benefit of multiple interactions mediates nucleoplasmin NLS recognition, providing a rationale for the absence of an absolute requirement for any single amino acid in the sequence in contrast to the monopartite NLSs of the SV40 T antigen and c-myc. Point-mutation experiments identified the lysine residues 155­167 as the most important, consistent with the more extensive set of interactions observed at the P1, P2 and P2 pockets. Combination of any two such mutations abolished nuclear targeting [21]: the two clusters function in an interdependent manner by binding simultaneously at two sites on the same molecule. The correct orientation of the clusters is ensured by hydrogen bonds involving the peptide backbone at the small and large sites, and their correct positioning is made possible when a linker of at least ten residues is present to cover the physical separation between the two sites. The paucity of sidechain interactions between the linker and the protein is in agreement with the lack of precise amino acid requirements in the intervening sequence, which can be replaced by a polyalanine segment without affecting nuclear targeting [21]. The recurrence of proline and glycine residues, however, appears to facilitate the nestling of the

not identical to those involving the same amino acids in the equivalent pockets in the c-myc NLS complex. The ten linker amino acids separating the two basic clusters of the nucleoplasmin NLS make extensive mainchain interactions with the sidechains of conserved residues which line a conspicuous part of the Kap surface groove. The short turn following the upstream cluster and that preceding the downstream cluster are engaged in hydrogen-bonding interactions with Arg321 and Tyr283 in particular. These two

peptide along the curvature of the Kap surface and around the sidechains of Arg244, Arg321 and Tyr283, thus maintaining the wealth of mainchain interactions with the linker. In linkers of 11 or 12 amino acids [28], the preference for residues that are stereochemically compatible with sharp turns might be relaxed, but more stringent requirements on the correct positioning of the P2 residue might be necessary. Detailed modelling of longer bipartite NLSs such as the signal of the SWI5 transcription factor [29] is not straightforward, but general features can nevertheless be inferred. For example, electrostatic effects and steric hindrance (between the Trp279 residue of Kap and the phosphoserine 646 in the bipartite NLS linker) are likely to disrupt the interaction with Kap when the SWI5 transcription factor is phosphorylated, resulting in its cytoplasmic retention [29]. As the linker length increases, the cooperative binding of the clusters at the two sites would be more hampered than facilitated; linkers longer than 12 amino acids are in fact not common [16].
NLS sequence requirements

Figure 4

In the case of classical monopartite NLSs, a K­K/R­X­K/R (where X is any residue) consensus sequence appears to be a necessary minimal element [30]. The combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic properties at the P2, P3 and P5 pockets of the large site restrains productive binding to residues with long aliphatic sidechains and a positive charge at the tip. The particular shape and chemistry of the P2 pocket constrains the binding to lysine. Recognition of these three key positively charged residues is the major specificity determinant not only for the very basic SV40 NLS, but also for the more hydrophobic c-myc NLS. The consensus sequence is necessary but not sufficient. Whereas in the case of the SV40 T antigen NLS the consensus is flanked by positively charged residues making contacts at the adjacent pockets, in the case of the c-myc NLS it is flanked by hydrophobic and negatively charged residues. The adjacent pockets pose a less-strict requirement on the incoming NLS residue, although a small hydrophobic residue at P6 and a proline nestling at the P1 pocket appear to be favoured. These additional interactions at the large site, however, are not able to rescue a mutation of the critical lysine residue at the P2 pocket [17,23]. In the case of bipartite NLSs, no individual critical requirement in the sequence of the positively charged clusters appears to be necessary, and in fact the absence of a lysine residue at the P2 pocket is tolerated [23]. The conserved positively charged residues of nucleoplasmin are engaged in fewer interactions than the analogous ones in the monopartite NLSs that have been studied. Surprisingly, the nonconserved intervening sequence makes multiple interactions via its mainchain with conserved Kap residues and contributes to the binding of this bipartite NLS.

The molecule is shown rotated about the horizontal axis by approximately 90° in respect to the orientation in Figure 1. The viewer looks down the extended surface groove as in Figure 2b. Polar inter-actions between the bipartite NLS backbone and conserved protein residues (white) along the spine of the surface groove are indicated by dotted lines. The figure was generated using RIBBONS [46] and GRASP [47].

Canonical NLS-containing proteins are all imported by yeast  and by the several known human  isoforms, albeit with different efficiencies [31]. The weaker binding of the yeast receptor for certain NLSs, including nucleoplasmin, observed in comparison to other species is at present unclear. These differences might be because of additional interactions of the full-length protein rather than to differential binding of their NLSs, given the level of conservation in the recognition events of the corresponding NLS motifs observed in the structures. The NLS motifs of the

336

Structure 2000, Vol 8 No 3

SV40 T antigen, human c-myc and Xenopus nucleoplasmin bind S. cerevisiae Kap50 at surface residues most of which are absolutely conserved across species. The structures fully support the prediction that the classical monopartite NLSs are a very efficient variant of the downstream cluster of a bipartite NLS [21], in which strengthening of the downstream cluster can be achieved using a variable set of interactions. It is expected that other single NLSs might interact at the smaller site [32] by strengthening the interactions at the upstream cluster to optimally exploit the binding pockets in the C-terminal part of Kap. The Stat protein is a probable candidate, as are the nuclear targeting signals of the NPI and LEF-1 proteins [32­34]. In this case the consensus sequence would be a K/R­K/R motif, which is too short to be unequivocally identified by simply looking at the sequence of interest. The surface groove C-terminal to the P1 and P2 pockets is not conserved across species, and the potential binding pockets at ARM 9 and ARM 10 will have characteristics that depend on which  homologue is involved in substrate recognition. In this context, a reasonable expectation from the structures is that mutation of two residues on the surface of the protein (Asp203 at the P2 pocket and Glu402 at the P2 pocket) might be sufficient to abolish binding of most if not all NLSs recognized by Kap. Although the sequence of the NLS peptide is somewhat variable, its conformation is strictly bestowed by hydrogenbond interactions that straighten the NLS backbone into an extended conformation. This is presumably an enforced conformation, in which the peptide is molded on the protein template as in other `peptide-surface' recognition events [35]. The monopartite NLS of the NFB transcription factor for example, is flexible and unstructured in the nuclear form of the protein when bound to DNA [36], and is in a helical conformation in the cytoplasmic form when bound to its inhibitor IB [37]. Similarly, the N-terminal autoinhibitory segment of Kap is in a helical conformation when bound to Kap [38], and in a  strand conformation when bound to Kap [26]. This is even more striking, given the similarity of the structural frameworks of Kap and Kap. Bipartite NLSs can analogously be partially disordered [39], or entirely helical [40]. It is unclear how the structure of the karyophilic protein is modified during recognition and transport into the nucleus, particularly in the case of bipartite NLS-containing proteins. The NLS would have to be presented on the surface of the protein in a conformation that is sufficiently unconstrained to allow its recognition and binding as an extended  strand.

the macromolecule to be imported and on its recognition by a nuclear transport receptor. In the case of the classical nuclear import pathway, the recognition of a variety of NLS cargoes is mediated by an adaptable adaptor molecule, karyopherin  (Kap or importin ). Two idiosyncratic features of Kap seem to allow adaptability in substrate recognition without limiting specificity. First, the repeated architecture of the protein is responsible for the creation of an array of binding pockets, which are regularly spaced along the concave surface groove of the adaptor. Second, the relative flexibility of the protein scaffold allows fine-tuning of the modular arrangement of the binding pockets, which can be exploited to different extents according to the number of sidechains and sequence properties of each individual NLS. The segmental nature of the molecular construction of Kap facilitates such small conformational rearrangements. Classical monopartite signals utilize the large site in the N-terminal part of the surface groove with a multitude of interactions. A minimal set of positively charged residues plays a pivotal role in binding, supplemented by additional interactions that can be either electrostatic (SV40) or hydrophobic (c-myc). Bipartite NLSs like nucleoplasmin distribute their binding potential along the entire conserved surface groove. The abundance of the contacts made allows in this case suboptimal interactions to occur at the single binding pockets. In fact, optimal interactions along the whole of the surface groove might not be attainable and might also be not as advantageous given that the NLS-containing protein has to be released once in the nucleus. The Kap adaptor protein appears to have evolved to maximize specificity and versatility in NLS recognition, but not necessarily affinity.

A TyrAsp mutation was introduced at residue 397 in the S. cerevisiae Kap construct spanning residues 88­530, which had been previously subcloned in a pProEx-HTb expression vector [24]. This single amino acid substitution was performed with the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the instructions of the manufacturer. The Y397D mutant of yeast Kap 88­530 was isolated from an overproducing strain of Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3) and purified with similar protocols used for the wild-type protein [24]. The Y397D Kap mutant exhibited improved expression and solubility properties as compared with the wild-type construct, with 30 mg of pure protein being obtained from each litre of bacterial culture. The pure protein was concentrated to 40 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and stored at ­20°C. An undecapeptide corresponding to the c-myc NLS (319GPAAKRVKLDS329) was expressed as a fusion with a portion of the Trp LE sequence and purified from inclusion bodies in bacteria [41]. In this plasmid, the linker between the Trp-leader and the peptide sequence codes for a polyhistidine tract and for an adjacent methionine, to allow for affinity purification and for cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleav-

Biological implications
Transport of cytoplasmically synthetized proteins into the nucleus is a highly regulated process in eukaryotes. It relies on the presence of a targeting signal (NLS or nuclear localization signal) encrypted in the sequence of

age, respectively. The fusion polypeptide was expressed in E. coli (BL21 DE3) by induction at an OD600 of 0.3 with 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells from 3 l of culture were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF. Following cell lysis with a French pressure cell and high-speed centrifugation, the insoluble pellets were collected and dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 6 M guanidinium-HCl (GuCl) by gentle rocking overnight. Cell debris were removed by high-speed centrifugation and the supernatant loaded onto a Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, 5 mM imidazole, and eluted with an imidazole gradient. The peak fractions were extensively dialyzed against water, and the fusion polypeptide (about 100 mg as estimated by absorbance at 280 nM) was lyophilized. Cleavage of the downstream 116 amino acid sequence from the c-myc sequence was achieved by incubating the lyophilized material with 15 ml of 70% formic acid, 40 mg/ml CNBr for 90 min in the dark. The cleavage reaction was stopped by adding ten times the reaction volume of water. After lyophilization, the sample was solubilized in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 6 M GuCl and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C4 VIDAC column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Elution with a 0.09% TFA, 70% acetonitrile (CH3CN) gradient was monitored at a wavelength of 230 nM. The fraction containing the c-myc peptide eluted at a CH3CN concentration of 29.4%, as confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry (measured mass 1141.4 Da; predicted mass 1141.3 Da). A similar method was used for producing a nucleoplasmin NLS peptide, which eluted from the reverse-phase column at a CH3CN concentration of 19.0%. The results reported in this paper, however, were obtained with a nucleoplasmin NLS-like peptide CATAQGGGA154VKRPAATKKAGQAKKKKLD172, a generous gift of Daniela Rhodes (MRC, Cambridge UK).

Values for one of the two complexes in the asymmetric unit. unambiguous peak at 11  and 14  above the mean value for the c-myc and the nucleoplasmin crystal forms respectively, with the next highest peak being below 5.5 . Translation function calculations between 10 and 4 Å resolution yielded two solutions for the c-myc co-crystals, with a correlation coefficient of 48.6 (correlation coefficient of 14.0 for the next highest peak). In the case of the nucleoplasmin co-crystals, the translation function gave a peak with a correlation coefficient of 44.2 (correlation coefficient of 33.6 for the next highest peak). Examination of the solutions on the graphics using the program O [44] revealed good packing and no stereochemical clashes with symmetry-related molecules. The models were refined with the maximum-likelihood target in the program CNS [45]. No sigma cut-off was applied to the data and lowresolution terms to 30 Å were included in the refinement and a random sample containing 5% of the data was excluded. The progress of the refinement was judged by monitoring the agreement between calculated and observed structure factors for the excluded reflections (Rfree). In the c-myc crystal form, strict noncrystallographic twofold symmetry was initially enforced. Rounds of rigid-body refinement were carried out with Kap50 subdivided in four domains, comprising residues 89­204 (ARM 1,­3), 205­330 (ARM 4­6), 331­417 (ARM 7, 8) and 418­509 (ARM 9, 10). The model was then subjected to cycles of positional refinement gradually increasing the resolution limits from 3.5 Å to 2.1 Å, including cycles of atomic temperature-factor refinement beyond 2.6 Å resolution. The placement of the c-myc peptide was straightforward at the two NLS binding sites present on the surface of each molecule, and unambiguous electron density was also present for the Y397D substitution of the Kap mutant. Noncrystallographic constraints were released and subsequent model building and refinement were carried out independently for the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model has a Rfree is 27.7% to 2.1 Å resolution and good stereochemistry (Table 1). In the nucleoplasmin crystal form, initial rigid-body refinement was performed with Kap subdivided in the above-mentioned four domains and followed by cycles of positional and B-factor refinement with a stepwise increase in resolution. Electron-density maps calculated at this stage showed strong density corresponding to the bound peptide. Rounds of model building and refinement to 2.4 Å resolution finally resulted in a Rfree of 26.5 with good statistics (Table 1). The model comprises 417 amino

Crystallization and data collection
Co-crystallization experiments of wild-type Kap50 with NLS peptides failed to yield crystals, the protein precipitating upon NLS addition. Cocrystals of the Y397D Kap50 mutant with either the c-myc or nucleoplasmin peptides were readily obtained with standard crystallization and additive screenings (Hampton Research), using a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml and a threefold excess of peptide. X-ray data were measured at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) A1 beamline and processed using the Denzo/HKL package [42]. A summary of the data collection statistics for both the c-myc and nucleoplasmin crystal forms is given in Table 1. The c-myc NLS­Kap mutant co-crystals were grown at 4°C by the vapor diffusion hanging-drop method using a reservoir solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 200 mM sodium acetate (NaAce), 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. The crystals appeared in two weeks as thin plates with uneven edges, and were flash-frozen in liquid propane after a quick transfer in a solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 100 mM (NaAce), 25% (w/v) PEG 4000, 20% glycerol. Despite being 40 micron thick at best, these crystals are well ordered and diffracted X-rays to 2.1 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation. Their space group is P21, with cell dimensions a = 42.7 Å, b = 85.9 Å, c = 117.5 Å,  = 93.4°. The crystals have a solvent content of 43% (Vm = 2.1) with two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a twofold axis parallel and almost adjacent to the crystallographic b axis. The nucleoplasmin NLS­Kap mutant complex was co-crystallized by vapor diffusion at 4°C using 16% (w/v) PEG 8000, 250 mM potassium di-hydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), 50 mM n-octylglucoside (BOG). The crystals were cryo-protected for 2 min in 15% (w/v) PEG 8000, 100 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM BOG, 20% glycerol and frozen in liquid propane. Crystallographic data were measured to 2.4 Å resolution. The diffraction is consistent with space group C2, with cell dimensions a = 157.6 Å, b = 63.7 Å, c = 62.1 Å,  = 97.3. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule, for a solvent content of 60% (Vm = 3.1).

Structure determination and quality of the model
Phases were determined using the molecular replacement method with the program AmoRe [43] using the Kap50 model [24]. Rotation functions were carried out between 8 and 3.5 Å resolution, and resulted in an

acid residues for the yeast mutant (90­506), 19 amino acid residues for nucleoplasmin (153­171) and 31 water molecules. The average temperature factors are 61.3 Å2 for all protein atoms and 72.4 Å2 for the nucleoplasmin NLS, suggesting a partial occupancy of 85% for the peptide in this co-crystal. Despite the relatively high B factor values, the electron density for the nucleoplasmin NLS peptide is of good quality.
