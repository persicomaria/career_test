SUMMARY

The capsids of mature retroviruses perform the essential function of organizing the viral genome for efficient replication. These capsids are modeled as fullerene structures composed of closed hexameric arrays of the viral CA protein, but a high-resolution structure of the lattice has remained elusive. A three-dimensional map of two-dimensional crystals of the R18L mutant of HIV-1 CA was derived by electron cryocrystallography. The docking of high-resolution domain structures into the map yielded the first unambiguous model for full-length HIV-1 CA. Three important protein-protein assembly interfaces are required for capsid formation. Each CA hexamer is composed of an inner ring of six N-terminal domains and an outer ring of C-terminal domains that form dimeric linkers connecting neighboring hexamers. Interactions between the two domains of CA further stabilize the hexamer and provide a structural explanation for the mechanism of action of known HIV-1 assembly inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION During the late stages of their replication cycle, retroviruses assemble as ``immature'' virions composed of 2000­4000 copies of the virally encoded Gag polyprotein (Briggs et al., 2004, 2006; Parker et al., 2001). Concomitant with release from an infected cell, virions undergo a process called ``maturation,'' during which Gag is proteolytically cleaved into three major proteins: the MA protein remains associated with the viral membrane, the NC protein recruits and packages the viral genome, and the CA protein oligomerizes to form a closed ``mature'' capsid ¨ that surrounds this NC/RNA complex (Gottlinger, 2001; ¨ Krausslich, 1996). Cleavage of Gag and assembly of the mature capsid are essential for infectivity.

Mature retroviral capsids can be conical, spherical, or cylindrical (Vogt, 1997). Despite this variation in capsid morphology, it is now established that retroviral CA proteins adopt the same tertiary structure, and that the different capsid shapes arise from common design principles. Retroviral CA proteins are composed of two independently folded domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), connected by a flexible linker (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999; Campos-Olivas et al., 2000; Cornilescu et al., 2000; Gamble et al., 1996, 1997; Gitti et al., 1996; Jin et al., 1999; Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999; Kingston et al., 2000; Momany et al., 1996; Mortuza et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2002; Worthylake et al., 1999). Both domains of CA have predominantly a-helical secondary structure: the HIV-1 CA NTD is shaped as an arrowhead, with seven a helices (numbered 1­7) and an amino-terminal b-hairpin (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999; Gamble et al., 1996; Gitti et al., 1996), while the CTD is more globular, with a single-turn 310-helix and four short a helices (numbered 8­11) (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999; Gamble et al., 1997; Worthylake et al., 1999). The prevailing model is that all mature capsids are built on hexameric lattices of CA and closed by incorporating 12 pentameric declinations. The relative distribution of the declinations within the hexameric lattice defines the shape of the capsid: tubular capsids are formed by introducing 6 pentamers at each end of a cylindrical tube, conical capsids result from an asymmetric distribution of the pentamers at the two ends of a conical assembly, and ``spherical'' capsids arise from a more even distribution of the pentamers throughout the hexameric lattice (Ganser et al., 1999; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2004; Jin et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000). This general model is supported by extensive structural, biochemical, and genetic data. For example, lowresolution EM studies of in vitro assemblies of CA, such as cylinders and two-dimensional (2D) crystals, as well as bona fide mature capsids have shown that retroviral CA proteins form a hexameric lattice, with the NTD apparently forming the hexamers, and the CTD forming dimeric linkers that connect neighboring hexamers (Briggs et al., 2003; Li et al., 2000; Mayo et al., 2002, 2003). In addition, X-ray crystallographic studies of

truncated CA proteins have revealed an atomic resolution model for the hexamer formed by the NTD of N-tropic murine leukemia virus (Mortuza et al., 2004) and several possible models for the CTD dimer (Gamble et al., 1997; Ivanov et al., 2007; Jin et al., 1999; Ternois et al., 2005; Worthylake et al., 1999). Finally, biochemical and genetic experiments suggest the existence of NTDCTD interactions that are essential for capsid formation (Bowzard et al., 2001; Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2004; Lanman et al., 2003, 2004). In spite of these substantial results, a high-resolution structure of full-length, hexameric CA has never been visualized. An alternative approach to derive a molecular model of full-length CA is to determine a moderate resolution structure by electron crystallography of 2D crystals and dock NMR or X-ray crystal structures of the individual domains. Here, we report the three-dimensional struc° ture of hexameric arrays of full-length HIV-1 CA at 9 A resolution using electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) and image analysis. Docking the high-resolution structures of the two HIV-1 CA domains into the cryoEM density map enabled visualization of a pseudoatomic model of full-length CA hexamers. The lattice parameters of the 2D crystals closely match the packing of CA in authentic mature virions (Briggs et al., 2003; Yeager et al., 1998). Therefore, we believe that these crystals recapitulate the hexameric lattice of HIV-1 CA in mature infectious particles. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Assembly and Structure Determination of Full-Length HIV-1 CA Hexamers Wild-type full-length HIV-1 CA assembles in vitro into long cylinders (Figure 1A) (Ehrlich et al., 1992). In contrast, a single point mutation, R18A, shifts the in vitro assembly phenotype into spheres, cones, and cylinders ­ the three mature capsid shapes observed in retrovirions (GanserPornillos et al., 2004). We have examined other aminoacid substitutions of Arg18 and discovered that replacement with a large hydrophobic residue (i.e., Val, Ile, Leu, Phe) generated CA proteins that assembled predominantly as spheres, as illustrated in Figure 1B for the mutant R18L. Optimization of the assembly conditions yielded cylinders, cones, and very large spheres up to $2.5 mm in diameter. When applied to a continuous carbon EM grid, these large spheres collapsed and flattened, and behaved as well-ordered 2D crystals (Figure 1C), exhibit° ing diffraction to beyond 10 A resolution (Figure 1D). As expected, optical diffraction analysis revealed two nonoverlapping hexagonal lattices arising from the top and bottom layers of the flattened spheres (Figure 1D). Analysis of low-dose images of frozen-hydrated crystals at a series of tilt angles yielded a three-dimensional map of ° full-length HIV-1 CA at 9.0 A resolution parallel to the plane ° of the flattened sphere and 20 A perpendicular to it (Figure 2A and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online; Table 1).

Description of the CryoEM Map and Fitting of the NTD and CTD Full-length HIV-1 CA packs as a hexamer within the flat° tened spheres (p6 plane group; a = b = 92.7 A) (Figure 2A, Tables 1 and S1). The CA hexamers have an exterior diam° ° eter of $90 A, and the protein shell is $60 A thick. Given ° the dimensions of the NTD (18 3 35 3 45 A) and CTD ° ), this is a surprisingly compact structure, (29 3 36 3 28 A indicating that the two domains of CA are in close contact. There are several well-resolved lobes of density within each monomer, some of which appear rod-like and can be interpreted as individual a helices (for example, see Figures 3A and 4). To generate an unbiased molecular model from the experimental density map, we used a correlation-based program to perform automated rigid-body fitting of ordered residues from high-resolution structures of the isolated CA NTD (residues 1­148; pdb code 1gwp) and CTD (residues 149­219; pdb code 1a43) (see Experimental ´ Procedures) (Chacon and Wriggers, 2002; Gitti et al., 1996; Worthylake et al., 1999; Wriggers et al., 1999).

shows that six CA molecules associate laterally to form the hexameric unit, with the NTDs (colored green) close to the surface. The CTDs (colored blue) are located adjacent to and beneath the NTDs (Figure 2F), and form homodimers that connect neighboring hexamers. Although the NTDs and CTDs were fitted separately as individual domains, the pseudoatomic model clearly defines the fulllength CA monomer because the carboxy terminus of each NTD is located immediately adjacent to the amino terminus of a neighboring CTD (indicated by asterisks in Figures 2B­2D). Interestingly, the intramolecular contacts between the two domains of one CA monomer appear to be fairly minimal. Instead, the NTD and CTD participate in extensive intermolecular contacts, which undoubtedly stabilize the hexameric lattice (Figure 2D). The NTD-NTD Hexamerization Interface ° Consistent with previous EM studies at 20­30 A resolution (Li et al., 2000; Mayo et al., 2002), the NTD of HIV-1 CA forms the inner ring of the hexamers (Figures 2A­2C). NTD-NTD interactions are mediated through helices 1, 2, and 3, which associate as an 18-helix bundle in the center of the hexamer (Figure 3B). This arrangement provides a molecular understanding of mutagenesis and biochemical experiments showing that alanine substitutions of surface-exposed residues in helices 1 and 2 disrupt HIV-1 CA assembly in vitro and in vivo (orange spheres in Figures 2E and 2F) (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2004; von Schwedler et al., 2003) and that amide protons in helices 1, 2, and 3 are protected from deuterium exchange upon assembly in vitro (Lanman et al., 2003). Interestingly, the ribbon model of the NTD structure deviates somewhat from the boundary of the experimental density, particularly for helices 4, 5, and 7 (Figure 3A). These deviations may indicate the occurrence of assembly-induced conformational changes, although they may equally be artifacts due to the limited z-resolution of the cryoEM map. The amino terminal b-hairpin, which forms in the context of the mature CA protein, is ordered in our structure

showed excellent correspondence with the experimental density. We did not observe density corresponding to the last 12 residues of CA, which are typically disordered in X-ray structures of the CTD. The cyclophilin A-binding loop, between helices 4 and 5 in the NTD, is also not resolved in our map, consistent with the observation that this loop is not required for CA assembly in vitro (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2004). A top view of the pseudoatomic model corresponds to a view of the outer surface of the capsid (Figure 2A) and

Note that all CTD helices, including the single-turn 310 helix, are accounted for in the cryoEM map. (B) Same as in (A), except that the 1a43 structure was fitted as a dimeric unit.

(colored yellow in Figure 3A). Biochemical and genetic experiments of this region of CA have been puzzling: although the b-hairpin forms after Gag proteolysis and is essential for infectivity, CA proteins missing the entire hairpin can still assemble into cylinders in vitro (Tang et al., 2002; Gross et al., 1998, 2000; von Schwedler et al., 1998). It has been suggested that the six b-hairpins might form extended interactions within the mature CA hexamer (Mortuza et al., 2004), but the map shows that the individual strands are too far separated to form a b-barrel type structure (Figures 2C and 2D). It is therefore more likely that the b-hairpin stabilizes assembly-competent conformations of important residues in helix 1 and 2, and/or that b-hairpin formation disrupts interactions that stabilize the immature lattice, as suggested previously (Kelly et al., 2006; Mortuza et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2002). The limited resolution of our map precludes a precise description of side chain conformations. Nevertheless, the pseudoatomic model defines a local probability sphere wherein each individual residue is most likely located. Thus, we can make some informed guesses as to the positions of these side chains and their possible interactions. For example, Arg18, which was mutated to leucine for this study, is located at an annulus, where helices 1 from the six NTDs are at their closest approach. It appears that the guanidinium sidechain of Arg18 is well placed to form annular interactions (colored magenta in Figures 2E and 2F), which may explain the dramatic effects on the morphology of in vitro assembled particles when this residue is mutated (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2004). The HIV-1 CA NTD hexamer is essentially identical to the hexamer formed by the NTD of N-tropic murine leuke-

mia virus CA that was crystallized without its CTD (Figure 3B) (Mortuza et al., 2004). Note that there is no detectable primary sequence homology between these two retroviral CA proteins, which also form capsids of different shapes (HIV-1 is conical and N-MLV is spherical). This result establishes that the CA hexamer is conserved across at least two widely divergent, and likely all, retroviruses. Importantly, the unit cell spacing of both the HIV-1 and ° N-MLV NTD hexamers (92.7 A) corresponds to the CA spacings measured in EM studies of mature virions (90­ ° 110 A) (Briggs et al., 2003; Yeager et al., 1998), supporting the idea that these crystals represent the hexameric lattice in mature capsids. Interestingly, low-resolution EM studies further indicate that CA also forms hexamers in the immature retroviral capsid, i.e., as a domain of the viral Gag polyprotein. These hexamers appear smaller, with a spac° ing of 80 A, and may therefore have a different packing arrangement (Briggs et al., 2004, 2006; Yeager et al., 1998). The CTD-CTD Dimerization Interface ´ HIV-1 CA forms soluble dimers (Gamble et al., 1997; Rose et al., 1992; von Schwedler et al., 1998). Dimer formation in solution is mediated solely through the CTD, and biochemical and structural studies have mapped the dimerization interface primarily to helix 9 (Gamble et al., 1997). Notably, alanine substitutions of W184 and M185, located in the middle of helix 9, diminish dimerization in vitro and infectivity in vivo (shown as yellow spheres in Figures 2E, 2F, 4A, and 4B) (Gamble et al., 1997; von Schwedler et al., 1998, 2003). This interface is therefore required for efficient assembly of both mature and immature capsids. Note that HIV-1 CA is the only retroviral CA protein to form

dimers in solution, among the several that have been characterized in detail. Therefore, a measurable dimerization affinity in solution is not critical for assembly; nevertheless, we expect that all retroviral CA CTDs use the same helix 9 interface for capsid lattice assembly. To date, five X-ray crystal structures of wild-type HIV-1 CA CTD have been reported, which in the aggregate suggest four possible configurations of the CTD dimer (Berthet-Colominas et al., 1999; Gamble et al., 1997; Ivanov et al., 2007; Ternois et al., 2005; Worthylake et al., 1999). Three of these dimers form via parallel pair-wise packing of helix 9 from each monomer, but the crossing angles of helix 9 are different in each structure (Figures 4B­4D, left panels). Each two-fold axis in the cryoEM map is surrounded by symmetry-related helical densities that are almost parallel. This most closely matches the helix 9 packing geometry in 1a43, the X-ray structure of the apo CA146-231 dimer (Gamble et al., 1997; Worthylake et al., 1999), and indeed, 1a43 is the only structure that can be fitted reasonably as a dimeric unit into our map (Figure 4B). Automated rigid-body fitting of the two other

CTD dimers (1a8o and 2buo) failed to provide meaningful solutions (not shown). Figures 4C and 4D illustrate the results of manual fitting of the 1a8o and 2buo dimers, respectively, wherein one monomer was matched to the cryoEM density: there is a clear mismatch with the second monomer. The density match for the fitted 1a43 dimer was still not optimal, however (Figure 4B), and the best fit was obtained by fitting the CTD as a monomeric unit (Figure 4A). These observations indicate that there may be conformational changes in the CTD dimer during assembly. For example, a minor adjustment in the dimer packing geometry appears to occur, in comparing the 2D lattice (Figure 4A) and 3D crystal (Figure 4B). We speculate that this may involve sliding or twisting motions of the helix 9 pairs across the dyad, although the atomic details of such small movements cannot be visualized at the current resolution. Additionally, changes in the tertiary structure of the CTD itself appear required to accommodate binding of the NTD, through an intermolecular NTD-CTD interface that was not resolved in previous low-resolution EM structures of full-length CA hexamers (see below).

As described in a recent report, an HIV-1 CA CTD construct containing a single amino-acid deletion forms a ``domain-swapped'' dimer (Ivanov et al., 2007). This dimer was proposed to be an assembly intermediate in the formation of the immature Gag lattice, but a role in mature CA capsid assembly could not be ruled out. The domainswapped CTD structure (pdb code: 2ont) has a distinct packing geometry and could not be fitted as a dimeric unit into our cryoEM density map (not shown). Additionally, a second distinguishing feature of the domain-swapped dimer is the absence of a kink in helix 9 (Ivanov et al., 2007). This kink is clearly present in our cryoEM map and in all previous X-ray structures of the CTD (Figure S2). These observations suggest that a domain-swapped CTD dimer may not be present in the assembled hexameric lattice of mature HIV-1 CA. The NTD-CTD Interface The existence of an NTD-CTD interaction was originally inferred from studies of Rous sarcoma virus CA, which showed that an assembly incompetent CTD mutant (R170Q, helix 9) could be partially rescued by an additional mutation in the NTD (P65Q, helix 4) (Bowzard et al., 2001). Chemical crosslinking experiments in HIV-1 CA cylinders also revealed that K182 (helix 9, CTD) is in close proximity to K70 (helix 4, NTD), further supporting this idea and suggesting that the interface is conserved (see Figure 5B) (Lanman et al., 2003). Importantly, the crosslinking experiments suggested that the interaction is intermolecular and not between the NTD and CTD of the same CA molecule. In an elegant series of experiments, Lanman, et al. (2003, 2004) used a deuterium exchange protection assay to establish that the NTD-CTD interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction surfaces were mapped to helix 4 in the NTD and helices 8 and 9 in the CTD. Our structure now reveals that in forming the mature lattice, the amino-terminal end of helix 4 of the NTD inserts into a groove in the CTD (Figure 5). The pseudoatomic model identifies potential contacts between helix 4 and helices 8 and 9 on one side of the groove, and the loop connecting helices 10 and 11 on the other (Figures 5B and 5C). To accommodate helix 4, some rearrangements in the above regions must occur, presumably by an induced fit mechanism. This is evident from apparent steric clashes between the NTD and CTD (Figure 5C), which were not adjusted during rigid-body fitting of the two domains. The pseudoatomic model also places portions of helices 8 and 11 in close proximity to helix 7 and the loop between helices 3 and 4 at the ``bottom'' of the NTD, suggesting that the NTD-CTD interface may extend to this region. The interactions between neighboring CA molecules in the hexameric lattice are therefore more extensive than originally inferred from low-resolution models. Therapeutic Implications The discovery of two inhibitors that appeared to target the NTD-CTD interface underscores its importance in

the formation of the mature CA lattice. One inhibitor, called CA-I, is a 12-residue peptide that was discovered ¨ by Krausslich and colleagues through phage display methods. CA-I abrogates both mature and immature capsid assembly in vitro (Sticht et al., 2005). An X-ray crystal structure of CA-I in complex with the isolated HIV-1 CA CTD (2buo) revealed that the peptide binds between helices 8, 9, and 11, and the authors proposed a competitive mode of action in mature capsid assembly (Ternois et al., 2005). Indeed, superposition of 2buo with our pseudoatomic model shows that CA-I binds in the same groove occupied by helix 4 (cyan helix in Figure 5B). A second inhibitor, called CAP-1, is a small molecule that has been shown to inhibit CA assembly in vitro and HIV-1 replication in tissue culture (Tang et al., 2003). Although CAP-1 was originally identified as a possible inhibitor of b-hairpin formation at the ``top'' of the NTD, subsequent NMR chemical shift footprinting studies suggested that instead, it binds at the ``bottom'' of the NTD. Residues that appear to form part of the NTD-CTD interface are among those that exhibited the greatest chemical shift changes (Tang et al., 2003). Taken together, these studies indicate that both CA-I and CAP-1 inhibit mature CA assembly by disrupting the complementary surfaces that form the NTD-CTD interface, and importantly, show that the HIV-1 CA lattice is a legitimate therapeutic target. Implications for Capsid Formation As noted above, the lattice spacing of the CA hexamers in the 2D crystals match the paracrystalline lattice in mature HIV-1 virions (Briggs et al., 2003; Yeager et al., 1998). Because our structure was solved from large, flattened spheres of HIV-1 CA, the 2D lattice would recapitulate the mature capsid lattice at its planar limit. Indeed, flat faces are apparent in EM images of natural HIV-1 capsids, particularly at the broad end of the cone (Accola et al., 2000; Kotov et al., 1999; Welker et al., 2000). However, it is clear that a fullerene cone capped on both ends exhibits a predominantly curved surface, and that therefore, the hexameric lattice must be inherently flexible. Cone models indicate that there are two distinct types of curvature within the conical HIV-1 capsid. One type exists around the 12 pentameric declinations required to close the cone. In these regions, there must be local five-fold symmetry, which the current structure does not readily explain. The second type of curvature is found in the conical body of the capsid. In these regions, the direction and degree of curvature changes continuously along the hexameric lattice. Low-resolution studies of CA tubes of different diameters and pitch indicate that the hexamers are preserved across these distinct tubes (Li et al., 2000), suggesting that their differing curvatures are accommodated, not by large global changes, but by more subtle local changes in protein tertiary and/or quaternary structure. On the basis of the packing interactions in our pseudoatomic model of full-length HIV-1 CA and X-ray crystal

structures of the individual domains, we envision two possible mechanisms for inducing curvature within the hexameric lattice. In the first mechanism, each CA hexamer could act as a rigid structural unit, and lattice flexibility would be achieved primarily through alternative packing of the CTD-CTD interaction surfaces. This suggestion arises from the crystallographic observation that CTD dimers, although formed from the same interface, can have different packing geometries (Figure 4). For example, it is possible that graduated rotations about this interface could produce the systematic, subtle changes in curvature required to produce the conical body of the capsid. Precedence for this idea comes from recent structural studies of the capsid protein of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, which demonstrate that small changes in the packing angle of two monomers about a dimer interface (range of rotation from 38 to 45 ) allowed the same protein to form two different types of closed capsids (T = 1 and T = 3 particles), as well as spirals (Tang et al., 2006). In the second mechanism, lattice flexibility could be achieved by changes in the CA tertiary structure. This would have the effect of ``warping'' the hexamer, allowing formation of a curved lattice while keeping the interaction interfaces fixed. Finally, we note that the two proposed mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and one can invoke a scenario wherein a combination of both hexamer warping and dimer interface rotations may produce different degrees of lattice curvature. The large range of curvatures available to the assembling CA lattice should, in theory, lead to high error rates and one would expect large percentages of aborted or spiralled structures that fail to close. Nevertheless, HIV-1 CA does form what appear to be closed (or very nearly closed) structures in vitro and in vivo with high frequency. For example, we found that almost all the small spheres formed by the R18L mutant appeared closed, despite ranging in size from 20­100 nm in diameter (i.e., each sphere has a different degree of curvature) (Figure 1B). In this regard, it should be noted that the in vitro studies also demonstrate that formation of a closed protein shell is intrinsic to CA, and does not require the presence of chaperones or additional factors. These observations suggest an unprecedented level of cooperativity during CA assembly, which is not easily explained by available models. Further studies are required to clarify the molecular details of this cooperativity and how the conical HIV-1 capsid is fashioned from the underlying hexameric framework described here.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Preparation and Assembly The R18L mutation was incorporated into the previously reported wildtype HIV-1 CA expression vector using standard cloning techniques. HIV-1 CA proteins were expressed and purified as previously described, concentrated to at least 70 mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at À70 C (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2004). To produce the large, flattened spheres, the R18L mutant was diluted to

32 mg/ml in assembly buffer containing 17.5% (w/v) PEG 20,000, 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 100 mM calcium acetate, and incubated at 37 for 1 hr.

Electron Cryomicroscopy and Image Analysis For EM analyses, a freshly prepared carbon-coated molybdenum grid was placed on 8 ml of the crystallization solution for 90 s. The grid was then washed with several drops of 0.1 M KCl, blotted to near dryness, and plunged into a slurry of liquid ethane. The grids were transferred under liquid nitrogen to a Tecnai F20 electron cryomicroscope (Philips/ FEI) operating at 120 kV. Images of crystals were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film using either the standard low-dose package or the automated Leginon software package (Suloway et al., 2005). Optical diffraction was used to select the best images of crystals with minimal drift and astigmatism. The negatives were digitized using a Zeiss SCAI densitometer at a step size of 7 mm and cropped to a size of 4000 3 4000 or 6000 3 6000 pixels with Adobe Photoshop. Image files were then converted to the MRC format, and Fourier transforms were calculated. The crystals were indexed manually using XIMDISP, and corrections for lattice distortions and effects due to the contrast transfer function were performed using the MRC program suite (Amos et al., 1982; Crowther et al., 1996; Henderson et al., 1986, 1990). Image data were merged as follows: First, the program ALLSPACE was used to determine the 2D plane group symmetry (Table S1) and calculate the appropriate phase origins used for image alignment (Valpuesta et al., 1994). The best (i.e., highest resolution) image recorded from an untilted sample was used as a reference to determine the phase origin of the remaining images. Special care was taken to determine the correct tilt geometry for images of tilted crystals. Lattice lines were then fitted to the 3D data, and an initial map was created using the CCP4 suite of programs. The phase origins and tilt geometries of each crystal were then refined against this initial model. Iterative refinements against subsequent models were continued until no further improvement in the overall phase residuals were observed. After obtaining the most self-consistent set of image parameters, the data set was again remerged and averaged, lattice lines were fitted and a final model was created. Data statistics are presented in Table 1, and a graphical representation of data quality is shown in Figure S1 (Cheng and Yeager, 2004).

Rigid Body Fitting The NMR structure of the NTD (pdb code 1gwp; http://www.rcsb. org) was initially fitted into a map covering 4 unit cells (equivalent to 4 hexamers or 24 monomers) using the program COLORES (stan° ´ dard parameters) with the target resolution set to 9.0 A (Chacon and Wriggers, 2002; Wriggers et al., 1999) (http://situs.biomachina.org). The program readily identified 24 unique, non-overlapping positions for the NTD. X-ray crystal structures of the CTD (1a43, 2buo, and 1a8o) were next fitted into the map as dimers. Only 1a43 yielded meaningful solutions. To fit the CTD as a monomer, a map was first created by subtracting out the NTD densities. Using this map, all three search models yielded the same 24 unique, non-overlapping solutions. The fits were then optimized to the full map, using the ´ program COLACOR (Chacon and Wriggers, 2002; Wriggers et al., 1999). Note that our initial fitting was performed on a map with an applied B-factor of À500. For clarity, the final figures were made from a map with an applied B-factor of À1000. The automated fitting of both maps was identical (data not shown). The final pseudoatomic model for the HIV-1 CA monomer and hexamer was generated from the monomer fits of 1gwp (residues 1­148) and 1a43 (residues 149­ 219).
