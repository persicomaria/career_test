ABSTRACT:
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control fundamental aspects of human physiology and behaviors. Knowledge of their structures, especially for the loop regions, is limited and has principally been obtained from homology models, mutagenesis data, low resolution structural studies, and high resolution studies of peptide models of receptor segments. We developed an alternate methodology for structurally characterizing GPCR loops, using the human S1P4 first extracellular loop (E1) as a model system. This methodology uses computational peptide designs based on transmembrane domain (TM) model structures in combination with CD and NMR spectroscopy. The characterized peptides contain segments that mimic the self-assembling extracellular ends of TM 2 and TM 3 separated by E1, including residues R3.28(121) and E3.29(122) that are required for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) binding and receptor activation in the

S1P4 receptor. The S1P4 loop mimetic peptide interacted specifically with an S1P headgroup analog, O-phosphoethanolamine (PEA), as evidenced by PEAinduced perturbation of disulfide cross-linked coiled-coil first extracellular loop mimetic (CCE1a) 1H and 15N backbone amide chemical shifts. CCE1a was capable of weakly binding PEA near biologically relevant residues R29 and E30, which correspond to R3.28 and E3.29 in the full-length S1P4 receptor, confirming that it has adopted a biologically relevant conformation. We propose that the combination of coiled-coil TM replacement and conformational stabilization with an interhelical disulfide bond is a general design strategy that promotes nativelike structure for loops derived from GPCRs. # 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control fundamental aspects of human physiology and behaviors1,2 and are the targets of 30% of currently marketed drugs.3 They share common topology characterized by seven transmembrane domains (TMs), with three intra- and three extra-cellular loops. There are at least 800 unique GPCR superfamily members encoded in the

human genome.4 The structure for only one GPCR, bovine rhodopsin, has been experimentally characterized at high resolution,5,6 demonstrating that three-dimensional structures for GPCRs are very difficult to obtain. Because of these difficulties, knowledge of other GPCR structures has principally been obtained from homology models, mutagenesis data, and low resolution structural studies. The sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors are particularly interesting because of their critical roles in the function of the cardiovascular and immune systems and their potential as targets in the treatment of diseases associated with these systems.7,8 Currently known S1P receptors belong to the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) GPCR family.9 Previous studies of the EDG receptor family10­13 and its closest relatives, the cannabinoid receptors,14 revealed that the extracellular loops, and extracellular ends of TMs 3, 4, 5, and 7, are required for receptor activation and ligand binding. Therefore, knowing the structure of these regions is critical to understanding the mechanism of ligand­protein interaction which, in the future, may allow inhibition or mimicry of the effects of S1P on the cardiovascular and immune systems by rationally designed analogs. We have developed, validated, and published models for human S1P1,10 human S1P4,15 and mouse S1P413 receptors. Although structures of the TMs were well defined in the homology models and consistent with experimental validation studies, the loop conformations remained uncertain due to their high flexibility and low sequence identity in comparison with other GPCRs. Thus, in this study, we developed a methodology for structurally characterizing membrane protein loops, using the human S1P4 first extracellular loop (E1) as a model system. This methodology uses computational peptide designs based on validated TM structural models in combination with circular dichroism spectropolarimetry and NMR spectroscopy. This approach builds on prior efforts by multiple research groups to characterize GPCR loop sequences in organic and aqueous solutions both without16­19 and with18,20 internal structural constraints. NMR structures have been determined for various segments of GPCRs including TMs of the a-factor receptor in 80% trifluoroethanol (TFE)21; the N-terminus,22 first extracellular loop23 and third cytoplasmic loop24 of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) in aqueous solution or SDS/DPC micelles; the third intracellular loop of the human cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1) in SDS micelles16; and bovine rhodopsin loops in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).17 Structural studies on unconstrained peptide mimics of GPCR loops indicated that the native conformation in the intact protein cannot be obtained in aqueous solution and SDS micelles.18,20 In contrast, introduction of chemical constraints such as octa-methylene

linker18,20 or S-carboxymethylcysteine-b-alanine18,20 gave rise to biologically relevant mimics of the cytoplasmic loops. Our long-term goal is to develop a method for studying loop structures in the context of TMs in aqueous solution without the need for an internal disulfide constraint. The present study represents several steps toward this goal. The peptides that we characterized contain the actual sequence of E1 flanked by soluble self-assembling segments that mimic the helical N-terminus of TM 2 and C-terminus of TM 3, including residues R3.28(121) and E3.29(122) that are required for ligand binding and receptor activation in the S1P4 receptor.13,15 Our results demonstrate that coiled-coil segments provide better self-assembly than binary patterned segments. Because of the limited length of the self-assembling segments, an internal disulfide constraint and TFE were required to characterize the structure of this construct. Extended selfassembling segments will be applied in future studies to eliminate the need for TFE and internal disulfide constraints.

RESULTS
Peptide Designs
Five loop mimetic peptides were designed as models of the E1 loop of S1P4. The sequence of the E1a peptide matched the S1P4 sequence from the extracellular end of TM2 to the extracellular end of TM3 with a cysteine substitution in each TM to provide an internal disulfide constraint. The binary pattern first extracellular loop mimetic (BPE1) and disulfide cross-linked binary pattern first extracellular loop mimetic (BPE1a) peptides utilized a binary pattern25 replacement strategy in the segments from TM2 and TM3 to promote self-assembly of the terminal helical segments, either without or with cysteine residues for an internal disulfide constraint, respectively. The coiled-coil first extracellular loop mimetic (CCE1) and disulfide cross-linked coiled-coil first extracellular loop mimetic (CCE1a) peptides utilized a coiled-coil replacement strategy for the segments from TM2 and TM3 to promote helical self-assembly, either without or with cysteine residues for an internal disulfide restraint, respectively. The E1a peptide failed to show appreciable aqueous solubility; therefore the remaining four peptides were compared as models of the S1P4 E1 loop.

and that they exhibited partial helical secondary structure in the presence of TFE (other traces). Helical content increased as the TFE concentration was increased from 20% to 50% (see Figure 1). The two peptides exhibited significant helical secondary structure in the presence of 100 mM SDS (Figure 1, insets). Similar results were obtained for the binary pattern first extracellular loop mimetic (BPE1) and BPE1a peptides under the same experimental conditions (data not shown), demonstrating that the coiled-coil and binary pattern designs gave rise to E1 loop mimic peptides with similar conformational properties under the conditions examined. Further, we determined that the CD spectrum of CCE1a in 10 mM phosphate buffer and 20% TFE was unaltered over the temperature range from 208C to 408C (data not shown).

the molar absorptivities after reaction with DTDP for cysteine and GSH (21,500 MÀ1 cmÀ1 and 24,100 MÀ1 cmÀ1, respectively). The molar absorptivity value that we determined for cysteine at pH 7.0 was similar to that reported previously (21,400 MÀ1 cmÀ1),26 and that at pH 4.5 was 21,800 MÀ1 cmÀ1, and thus, the cysteine calibration curve was utilized to estimate the thiol content of the peptides of interest. The thiol content of unlabeled and isotope-labeled forms of the Cys-containing E1 peptides (CCE1a and BPE1a) is reported in Table I. These results indicated that the unlabeled CCE1a and BPE1a peptides exist in the disulfide bonded form (>98%) in solution. The results from the thiol assays in combination with those from nonreducing SDS-PAGE provided evidence for an intramolecular-disulfide bond in BPE1a and CCE1a. The thiol contents of 15N labeled and double labeled CCE1a, however, are much higher; both reduced and oxidized forms coexist in the samples with the reduced : oxidized ratio $1:4 and 3:5 for 15N labeled and double labeled CCE1a, respectively. Chemical shifts of oxidized and reduced forms were resolved, thus the oxidized form of CCE1a could be characterized in the presence of the reduced form.

Backbone Assignment and Secondary Structure of BPE1a, CCE1, and CCE1a
Complete assignments were made for backbone resonances of the CCE1, CCE1a, and BPE1a peptides using standard procedures, as discussed under Materials and Methods. For the CCE1 peptide, backbone resonances were first assigned in 50% TFE. These assignments were then used to interpret the systematic changes in chemical shift values that occurred as the TFE concentration was reduced from 50% (Figure 2, black) to 20% (Figure 2, red) in 10% intervals. Amide proton resonances were dispersed over a greater than 1 ppm range, suggesting that CCE1 was folded at all TFE concentrations. The deviations of chemical shifts from the random coil values (Dd) of backbone atoms, especially 13Ca, are reliable indicators of secondary structure.27,28 The Dd 13Ca values observed for residues within a-helices are >0.7 ppm, for those within b-strands are <À0.7 ppm.27,28 Residues with Dd 13Ca values between these limits are designated as having random coil conformations. The Dd 13Ca values for CCE1 in 50% TFE (Figure 3, panel A-black bar) identified one helix between residues 4-19, a break between residues R20 and L21, and a second, less fully populated helix between residues 22 and 31. In 20% TFE (Figure 3, panel A-light grey bar), the Dd 13Ca values indicated that, while the first helix of CCE1 was highly populated, the second helix was largely unfolded. Our design goal was to characterize the structure of the E1 loop in a conformation that mimicked its natural conformation flanked by two transmembrane helices. Even in 50%

TFE, the second helix of CCE1 was only partially folded. Therefore, we investigated the conformation of the E1 peptides that had the potential to form a helix-stabilizing disulfide bond. The Dd 13Ca values for the BPE1a (Figure 3, panel A-dark grey bar) and reduced forms of the CCE1a peptides in the presence of 20% TFE (Figure 3, panel B-grey bar) were similar to those for the non-Cys containing peptide (CCE1), indicating the existence of similar secondary structure. However, the formation of a disulfide bond in CCE1a was associated not only with a highly populated a-helix between residues 4 and 14, but also with a second highly populated a-helix between residues 25 and 31 (Figure 3, panel B-black bar). We gained further insights polypeptide structure and dynamics by determining the value of the {1H}-15N heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (hetNOE) for each amide moiety in oxidized CCE1a (in the presence of 20% TFE). The value of the hetNOE for amide 1H-15N spin pairs reflects the extent to which amide groups fluctuate on the high picosecond to low nanosecond time scale. The amide hetNOE has a value of $0.8 in the rigid core of globular proteins and becomes negative in flexible polypeptides that exhibit extensive, uncorrelated motions.29,30 The amide hetNOE values for CCE1a (Figure 3, panel C) were consistent with structural insights gained from analysis of 13Ca Dd values. Most hetNOE values were >0.5 for amides in helix 1 (residues 4­14), while these values ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 for amides in helix 2 (residues 24­31). Large, negative values characterizing a high degree of flexibility and disorder were observed for residues at the two polypeptide termini and within the loop between the two helices. These results suggested that helix 1 was quite rigid while helix 2 exhibited some degree of conformational flexibility. The loop connecting the two helices is highly flexible.

Solution Structure of CCE1a with an Intramolecular-Disulfide Bond
We determined the 3D structure of CCE1a using NOE-based distance restraints derived from 3D 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra recorded at 308C in the presence of 20% TFE. Side chain proton resonances were first assigned through the analysis of multiple 3D spectra, including 3D C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and HCCH-COSY. Structures of CCE1a were calculated with ARIA 1.231 using a total of 748 unambiguous NOEs, including 205 intra-residue, 256 sequential, 197 medium-range, and 90 long-range restraints (Figure 3, panel D).

ited extent, within residues 24­31, confirmed the helical nature of these segments of oxidized CCE1a. In addition, interhelical NOEs were observed that allowed the orientation of the two helices to be determined. These NOEs are summarized in Table II. Consistent with the above NOE patterns, and the Dd 13Ca and hetNOE values discussed earlier (Figure 3, panel B and C), the calculated structures for CCE1a exhibited two helical segments that interact to form an overall helical hairpin shape (Figure 4, panel A and E). The 10 lowest-energy structures were in good agreement with and were well defined by experimental data (Table III).

structures are as follows. An a-helix was observed between residues 3 and 13, a 310-helix between residues 17 and 19, and a short a-helix at the carboxyl terminus between residues 28 and 31. Helical structure was interrupted at Ser14-Ala16 and in the loop between residues 20 and 23. Although residues 23­26 were not classified as a continuous a-helix, residues in this segment did exhibit a succession of turn conformations with helical characteristics based on the Ramachandran map. In comparison with the reduced peptide, the existence of a disulfide bond between the Cys residues at positions 10 and 28 stabilized the helical hairpin fold and served to fix the orientation of the two helical segments.

NMR Structure vs. Homology Model
The solution structure of CCE1a in 20% TFE is quite similar to that of the E1 loop (Figure 4, panel D and E) in the valiBiopolymers DOI 10.1002/bip

dated homology model of hS1P4.15 Both adopt a helical hairpin shape with helical segments at the N- and C-terminal ends. However, only residues 13­26 and 29­30 of the CCE1a peptide derive from the native S1P4 receptor; other segments derive from the coiled-coil protein, Arfatin (PDB entry 1I49). The two segments of CCE1a that were spliced from Arfatin served to mimic the arrangement of the second and third trans-membrane helices of the hS1P4 homology model. As intended, the orientation of these two helical segments are analogous to those of the homology model (Figure 4, panel E), although the distances between residues on either side of ° the helical hairpin are, on average, 1A shorter than corresponding distances in the homology model. The presence of a 310-helix at residues 17­19 observed from NMR structures is reasonable. The values of {1H}-15N NOE obtained for residues 17­18 are >0.5 (Figure 3, panel C) and the

PEA and the loop mimetic peptide was therefore expected to be weak due to the lack of two out of four residues known to be critical for high-affinity binding. Consequently, significant perturbation of CCE1a chemical shifts required a nearly 20fold molar excess of the PEA ligand over the CCE1a peptide. The pattern of PEA- and NEA-induced chemical shift perturbations as a function of sequence position (Figure 5, panel C) indicated that PEA was interacting at the expected site. Chemical shift perturbations at residues R17, F19, A24, R20, C28, and E30 were of greater magnitude in the presence of PEA compared to NEA and became significant at lower PEA concentrations than perturbations in the amino-terminal half. These results are consistent with the expectation that the interaction involves residues R29 and E30, retained as important S1P binding residues13,15 from the parent S1P4 receptor, as well as with a change in loop structure upon ligand binding. Thus the structure adopted by the peptide loop mimetic is able to specifically interact with an S1P headgroup analog but not a ceramide headgroup analog in a biologically rele-

C secondary chemical shift index (CSI) of T18 is >0.7 ppm (Figure 3, panel B) indicating stable structure at these residues. In contrast, residues in the central loop, Arg20-Pro23, are more dynamic (Figure 4, panel C-magenta), consistent with negative hetNOEs.

Ligand Titration
The S1P4 loop mimetic peptide specifically interacted with an S1P headgroup analog, phosphoethanolamine (PEA), but not with an analog of ceramide, N-acylethanolamine (NEA), as evidenced by titration-induced perturbation of CCE1a 1H and 15N backbone amide chemical shifts. S1P, containing a free amine and a phosphorylated alcohol, is an agonist of S1P4 whereas ceramide, with an acylated amine and a free alcohol, is not an S1P4 agonist. NEA was therefore used as a negative control to determine what chemical shift change values are typical reflections of nonspecific environmental changes. Titration of PEA into 15N-CCE1a caused the chemical shifts of some amides to change in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 5, panel A and B). The CCE1a design retains two amino acids (R29 and E30) essential for the binding of S1P by the full-length S1P4 receptor (R29 and E30 in the peptide correspond to R3.28 and E3.29 in S1P4), demonstrated by our previous mutagenesis studies.13,15 These residues, however, are not sufficient based on the observation that mutation of K5.38 or W4.64 to alanine additionally abolishes S1P binding to S1P4.13,15 The interaction between

DISCUSSION
Although the high-resolution structure of bovine rhodopsin provides valuable structural information for modeling G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) TMs, loop modeling remains problematic. We have developed a methodology for experimentally characterizing GPCR loop structures using the human S1P4 first extracellular loop (E1) as a model system. Loop mimetic peptides were designed using several different strategies to promote structure relevant to that of the intact receptor. The design using the native E1 sequence extended by one-third of each flanking TM with cysteine modification and a disulfide linker between TM2 and TM3 (E1a) failed to yield a soluble peptide. In addition, separation of E1a from the fusion partner was more complicated due to its hydrophobic interaction with the fusion protein. Replacement of hydrophobic helical sequences on either side of the loop with coiled-coil or binary patterns has advantages over the near-native design. The peptides with these design features were highly soluble and readily expressed and purified. CD spectra (see Figure 1) showed that E1 peptide loop mimetics were unfolded in aqueous medium and adopted partial helical secondary structure in TFE. TFE has been reported to stabilize secondary structures of peptides sequences with high helical propensity32­35 and solution structures determined by NMR in TFE have been shown to closely resemble those in membrane mimetic solvents.36,37 CD spectra indicated that the secondary structure of CCE1a in 100 mM SDS was similar to that observed in 20% TFE. We reason that the non-native disulfide bond present in the CCE1a peptide stabilized the helical hairpin conformation. In support of this, the CCE1 peptide, lacking this interhelical bond, required 50% TFE to exhibit the same secondary structure content as oxidized CCE1a in 20% TFE. 13Ca Dd values suggested that the E1 peptide based on the binary pattern design (BPE1a) was unfolded, while those based on the coiled-coil design (CCE1 and CCE1a) adopted partially helical structure in 20% TFE with a highly populated helix within the N-terminal segment and a shorter, less well populated helix within the C-terminal end (Figure 3, panel A). The relatively poorly populated C-terminal helix is reflected in the relatively weak absorbance at 222 nm in the circular dichroism spectra in small peptides38 (see Figure 1). In addition, introduction of an interhelical disulfide bond stabilized the second helix at the C-terminus (Figure 3, panel B-compare black to grey bars). The introduction of various restraints in studies of GPCR loop peptide structures has been reported previously.

parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone related protein receptor.18 In another study, S-carboxymethylcysteine-b-alanine was employed to form a cyclic peptide mimetic of the second intracellular loop of the V1A vasopressin receptor.20 Despite the restraint present in both peptides, they were unstructured in aqueous solution, but exhibited secondary structure in TFE and SDS/DPC (dodecylphosphocholine) micelles. Similar results were obtained in our studies of E1 peptidomimetics. However, our strategy of using a interhelical disulfide bond to stabilize the helical hairpin conformation is much simpler to implement through protein overexpression using the vector/host combination of pET32a/ BL21trxB(DE3) which enhances the formation of disulfide bonds in the E. coli cytoplasm,39 and proved to be useful for promoting a loop conformation we argue is relevant to that of the native receptor due to the observed interactions with an agonist headgroup analog. The higher helical propensity of the amino-terminal segment relative to that of the carboxy-terminal segment is likely due to larger number of residues from the coiled-coil model, Arfatin. We anticipate that designs incorporating a larger number of consecutive, coiledcoil-derived helical residues will be capable of presenting properly structured membrane protein loops in the absence of internal disulfide restraints and additives such as TFE or SDS. We propose that coiled-coil TM replacement is a general design strategy that may promote native-like structure for loops derived from GPCR. This methodology makes possible the structural characterization and examination of conformational dynamics of flexible loops from insoluble transmembrane proteins. Consistent with homology modeling, the solution structure of CCE1a adopted a helical hairpin shape with helical segments at the N- and C-termini. While the short helix between residues 17 and 19 was not observed in the homology model of human S1P4, this structural feature has been reported for the first extracellular loop of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R, residues 241­285).23 The solution structure of this receptor fragment in DPC micelles includes three a-helices. The first (residues 241­244) and third (residues 275­284) correspond to the end and the beginning of TM 2 and 3, respectively. The second helix (residues 256­264) is found to interact with parathyroid hormone. Compared to the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin5 (Figure 4, panel B), the hS1P4 receptor (Figure 4, panel D, E, and F) has a longer E1 loop. The orientations of TM 2 and TM 3 in the rhodopsin crystal structure are also different from those observed in hS1P4, revealing unique structural features of the S1P4 receptor. GPCR have dynamic structures that must be able to shuttle between active and inactive conformations in response to

chemical signals provided by agonists in the extracellular space. Overwhelming evidence indicates that GPCR adopt multiple active conformations40­45 in response to structurally distinct agonists to produce distinct pharmacological profiles. GPCR therefore must have intrinsic flexibility in order to adopt this array of conformations. Our NMR studies indicate that residues Arg109-Pro115, corresponding to Arg17-Pro23 in the peptide loop mimic, in the first extracellular loop of S1P4 contribute to this inherent and required flexibility in the S1P4 receptor (Figure 3, panel C). Both Arg20 and L21 exist in different conformations whose relative populations are sensitive to the environment as observed by NMR spectra recorded in phosphate and HEPES buffer (data not shown). Chemical shift perturbation in response to increasing PEA concentration at residues R17 and F19 were of greater magnitude than other perturbations indicating a structural change at these residues (Figure 5, panel C), although a direct interaction with PEA cannot be ruled out. In contrast, residues 105­108 are less mobile. The flexible residues may play an important role in the conformational changes occurring during activation, known to involve the third TM.46 The structured loop mimetic of the first extracellular loop of S1P4 was capable of weakly binding an agonist headgroup analog near biologically relevant residue E30 which corresponds to E3.29 in the full-length S1P4 receptor, consistent with adoption of a biologically relevant conformation. The lack of a significant chemical shift perturbation at R29, corresponding to R3.28 in the full-length S1P4 receptor, may be due to the significant distance between the guanidine functional group interaction and the backbone resonances monitored. The agonist headgroup interaction with the full-length S1P4 receptor is known to require four amino acid residues, of which only two are present in the peptide mimetic. This indicates that the full complement of extracellular loop residues may not be required in order to observe biologically relevant interactions at low affinities. Constructs such as the CCE1a peptide studied here may prove useful in SAR by NMR studies47 to identify weakly interacting fragments that may assist in the design of novel lead agonists and antagonists of GPCR therapeutic targets, although further studies are required to confirm this application.

Loop Mimetic Designs
The peptides studied herein were designed to present the first extracellular loop of human S1P4, (E1), and key features of the C- and Nterminal flanking sequences of TM 2 and TM 3, respectively, in a conformation that mimics that of this loop in the native receptor. In particular, the N-terminal flanking sequences included residues R3.28(121) and E3.29(122) of TM 3, which are required for ligand binding and receptor activation.13,15 A series of loop mimic peptides were designed using several different strategies to impose structural constraints similar to those that exist in the native S1P4 receptor. For one strategy, to control the orientation of the TM 2 and TM 3 helices, a Cys residue was introduced in each of these segments that allowed formation of an interhelical disulfide bridge through oxidation. The positions of the two Cys residues were determined through computer-based modeling with reference to our homology model of S1P4.13,15 As another strategy, we replaced hydrophobic helical sequences within TM 2 and TM 3 on either side of the E1 loop with sequences that conform to the coiled-coil (leucine-zipper, LZ) heptad repeat [coiled-coil first extracellular loop mimetic (CCE1) peptide] or to a binary pattern (BPE1 peptide), both of which promote helixhelix interactions. In binary pattern E1 peptides, we designed the sequence following principles described by the Hecht group25 so that all hydrophobic residues face inward toward other protein residues and hydrophilic residues orient outward toward the solvent. For coiled-coil constructs, we replaced the TM 2 and TM 3 sequences with sequences from structurally characterized water-soluble proteins in which a pair of antiparallel helices were oriented in a manner similar to that observed for the relevant segments of TM 2 and TM 3 in the S1P4 receptor model. Structurally relevant, anti-parallel helices with the LZ sequence, and the intervening loop, were excised from the following structures from the Protein Data Bank48: 1I49,49 1CII,50,51 1I4D,49 and 1UQ7.52 These sub-structures were superimposed on the segment of our S1P4 model containing the C-terminus of TM 2, the E1 loop, and the N-terminus of TM 3. The sub-structure of 1I49 superimposed with the lowest root mean square devia° tion (RMSD) of Ca atoms (1.6 A) with respect to the S1P4 segment and was subsequently used in the design of the coiled-coil E1 loop mimic peptide. Finally, as a third strategy, we combined the helical replacement and disulfide cross-linking strategies; these peptides are designated disulfide cross-linked coiled-coil first extracellular loop mimetic (CCE1a) and disulfide cross-linked binary pattern first extracellular loop mimetic (BPE1a). The BPE1 and BPE1a peptide models were generated from the E1 model of S1P4 receptor with sequence modification indicated in Table IV using the mutate function of the MOE computational package.53 The model of CCE1 was from X-ray structure of Arfatin (PDB entry 1I49) segment 139­148, followed by the model of E1 loop (residues 105­118 of S1P4) and concluding with residues 164­ 171 of 1I49 with two modifications, Q166R and A167E.

E1a is E1 with S106C and Q117C modifications. CCE1 consists of residues 139­148 of 1I49, followed by residues 105­18 of S1P4, concluding with residues 164­71 of 1I49 with Q166R(3.28) and A167E(3.29) modifications.

form for heteronuclear NMR studies. Oligonucleotides (Table V) corresponding to the coding sequence of each of the E1 loop mimic peptides (Table IV) were synthesized and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with appropriate oligonucleotide primers (Table V). The PCR-generated expression cassettes contained Msc I and EcoR I restriction sites at the 50 and 30 ends (with respect to the coding sequence), respectively. The E1 loop mimetic segments were preceded by a segment that encoded six His residues as a purification tag, a linker and a thrombin cleavage site, and were followed by two TAA stop codons. These cassettes were sub-cloned into the Msc I and EcoR I sites in pET32a (Novagen, Milwalkee, WI), which then expressed the His-tagged E1 peptides fused to the C-terminus of thioredoxin.

Thiol Assay
A thiol assay was used to monitor formation of a disulfide bond in some of the E1 loop mimic peptides. The assay was performed using Riener's method26 by determining the change in the absorbance at 324 nm of 4,40 -dithiodipyridine (DTDP) in the absence and presence of E1 peptides. Briefly, lyophilized peptides were dissolved in water to a concentration of 1.0­1.5 mM. Separately, a solution of 4 mM DTDP and 12 mM hydrochloric acid was prepared. The free thiol concentration of solutions of oxidized and reduced glutathione, and reduced cysteine, were used to calibrate the assay. 1 mM stock solutions of these three reagents were prepared in 100 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0. Calibration of free thiol concentration was performed by measuring the absorbance of cysteine and GSH at concentrations from 1-100 lM with and without the addition of 10 ll of the stock DTDP solution in a reaction mixture of 200 ll volume, containing 100 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0. Reagents were equilibrated for 5 min prior to measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 324 nm. Molar absorptivity was derived from the calibration curves using the Beer-Lambert Law: A ¼ cel. The free thiol concentrations of peptides of interest were calculated based on the calibrated molar absorptivity and the experimental absorbance recorded at 324 nm.

Peptide Expression and Purification
Overexpression of the fusion proteins was achieved in E. coli. BL21(DE3) cells cultured in MOPS-based minimal media54 or LB media by inducing with IPTG for 4 h at 208C. 15N/13C- or 15N-labeled samples were prepared by growing the cells in minimal medium containing 4 g 13C-labeled glucose and/or 1 g 15N-labeled ammonium chloride per liter of culture as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. The fusion proteins were purified using Ni2þ-affinity chromatography using standard procedures. The peptides of interest were cleaved with thrombin and further purified using reverse-phase HPLC with a C18 semi-preparative column (Vydac) and a water/CH3CN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid buffer system. The identities of the purified peptides were confirmed by tryptic digestion combined with analysis using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The presence of disulfide bond was confirmed using thiol assays.

Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry
CD spectra of E1 loop mimetic peptides were recorded between 185 and 260 nm using an AVIV model 62 DS spectropolarimeter. The peptide concentration was 25 lM in 10 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.0, with and without TFE or sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS). TFE concentration was varied from 10% to 50% by volume, and the

SDS concentration was 100 mM. Measurements were performed at temperatures of 258C or 208C, 308C and 408C in a quartz optical cell with a path length of 1 mm.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Several two-dimensional (2D) and 3D double- and triple-resonance NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) experiments were performed with 13C/15N-labeled BPE1a, CCE1, and CCE1a peptides to qualitatively monitor and compare peptide structure and to accurately determine the structure of each peptide. NMR experiments were performed using a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm triple-resonance probe with x,y,z pulsed magnetic field gradients (PFGs) or a Varian VNMRS 500 MHz spectrometer

equipped with a 5 mm triple-resonance probe. Peptide samples for NMR were prepared in 0.025% NaN3 and 20 or 50% TFE-d3, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 or 10 mM hepes buffer (for CCE1a only), at concentrations between 1.0 and 3.0 mM. The manufacturer's pulse programs were used for all experiments and acquisition parameters are summarized in Table VI. Backbone resonance assignments were determined through analysis of data from standard triple-resonance experiments, including 3D HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH. Sidechains were assigned through the analysis of 3D C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and HCCH-COSY spectra. 1 H-1H distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained through analysis of 3D 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra recorded with a mixing time of 200 ms.

Structure Calculation
Structure calculations were performed using ARIA 1.231 and CNS 1.1 using the PARALLHDG 5.3 force field in PARALLHDG mode.57 NOE peaks in 3D 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 3D 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra were assigned manually and their volumes were determined using Felix 98. The conversion from NOE peak volumes to interproton distances was performed by ARIA using relaxation matrix theory.58 The starting structure for each calculation was an extended peptide conformation and the ARIA computation cycle was repeated nine times. Two hundred structures were calculated during each computational cycle and the NOE/distance calibration was repeated between cycles using the 10 lowest-energy structures from the previous cycle. The CNS protocol used in this calculation included 75 ps of high-temperature torsion angle dynamics (TAD) (50,000­2000 K), followed by 75 ps cooling from 2000 K to 1000 K using TAD and 20 ps of further cooling (1000­300 K) using Cartesian dynamics, and, finally, 2000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. NOE violations present in the 10 lowest-energy structures after cycle eight were analyzed, assignments corrected, and structures recalculated until no violations were observed. The best 10 energy structures were further refined by molecular mechanics without restraints using the SANDER module of the AMBER 8.0 package.59 Quantitative structure analysis was performed with XPLOR60 and PROCHECK.61 The coordinates for the refined ensemble of CCE1a structures have been deposited under PBD ID code 2DCO.

NMR Loop Structure in the Context of the S1P4 Homology Model
We incorporated the NMR structural results for the E1 loop into our model of human S1P4, as follows. The Leu105-Trp118 segment in our model of human S1P4 was replaced by these residues from the lowest energy NMR solution structure (termed Leu13-Trp26) using split chain and join chain functions of the MOE computational package.53 Two amide bonds were created to join the NMR loop structure to the model of human S1P4; one is between the carboxyl group of Leu104 of the model and the amine group of Leu13 of the CCE1a solution structure and another is between the carboxyl group of Trp26 and the amine group of Phe119. The energy of the system was initially minimized to a root mean square gradient ° (RMSG) of 0.1 kcal/mol A while protein backbone atoms were fixed, except for those of Leu104, Leu13, Trp26, and Phe119. Energy minimization was repeated with no fixed atoms for 1,000 iterations of steepest descent, followed by conjugate gradient and Truncated ° Newton minimizations to a RMSG of 0.1 kcal/mol A. We acknowledge the Chemical Computing Group for generously donating the MOE program. We thank Weixing Zhang and Rensheng Luo for assisting with NMR experiments, and members of the Kriwacki laboratory at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for comments and assistance during the course of this study.

Ligand Titration
To confirm the biological relevance of the peptide loop mimetic, we titrated the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) headgroup analog, Ophosphoethanolamine (PEA), and the ceramide headgroup analog, N-acylethanolamine (NEA), into a solution of 15N-CCE1a and recorded a series of 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra. Peptide, NEA, and PEA samples were prepared in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 6, 0.025% NaN3 and 20% TFE-d3 and HSQC spectra were recorded with
