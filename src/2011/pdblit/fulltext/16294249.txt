Piperazinyl-amide derivatives of N-a-(3-trifluoromethyl-benzenesulfonyl)-L-arginine (1) were synthesized as graftable thrombin inhibitors. The possible disturbance of biological activity due to a variable spacer-arm fixed on the N-4 piperazinyl position was evaluated in vitro, against human a-thrombin, and in blood coagulation assay. Molecular modelling (in silico analysis) and X-ray diffraction studies of thrombin-inhibitor complexes were also performed. The fixation of bioactive molecules on poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) membranes was performed by wet chemistry treatment and evaluated by XPS analysis. Surface grafting of inhibitor 1d improved the membrane hemocompatibility by reducing blood clot formation on the modified surface.

1. Introduction
The design of biomaterials endowed with high blood compatibility (i.e. preventing clot formation) represents a substantial challenge.1 The usual strategies to improve hemocompatibility of material devices consist of selective surface treatments like the grafting of zwitterionic components as biomembrane mimics,2 coating with heparin3 or thrombomodulin,4 two natural anticoagulants, and the immobilization of extracellular matrix proteins or active small peptides for promoting the growth of endothelial cells.5 Another approach, less exploited till now, makes use of synthetic drugs that are active in preventing blood clotting. For instance, a thrombin inhibitor derived from Argatroban (MD-805)6 was graft-polymerized on the surface of polyurethane membranes.7,8 A p-amino-benzamidine derivative was covalently immobilized on maleic anhydride copolymer thin films by nucleophilic substitution via a spacer.9 In our laboratory, we are interested in the biocompatibilization of polymer materials by their surface derivatization with biologically active molecules of synthetic origin, designed on the basis of medicinal chemistry data. Polyesters, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) were chosen as model substrates. For instance, the surface grafting of peptidomimetics of the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence on PET membranes resulted in materials showing interesting cell adhesion properties.10,11 Now, we consider the possibility to improve the blood compatibility of polyesters by the covalent grafting of thrombin inhibitors. For that purpose, we have synthesized and evaluated a novel family of thrombin inhibitors equipped with a spacer arm for polymer surface anchorage. This study reports on the design, preparation, surface grafting and in vitro evaluation of the inhibitory activity and anticoagulant effect of this family of compounds based on the L-arginine template. Taking into account possible disturbance due to the spacer arm, in silico evaluation of the interaction with the protein active site has been performed, as well as the X-ray diffraction study of one representative thrombin-inhibitor complex.

Results
Design of the thrombin inhibitors

Clot formation results from a complex sequence of biochemical events including the blood coagulation cascade in which thrombin plays a central role. Thrombin is a serine protease involved in the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin and in the activation of platelet aggregation.12 This key protein has become the principal target in the discovery of novel antithrombotic agents.13,14 Historically, two research lines have been developed in parallel: (i) the steric inhibitors (non-covalently bound) based on two simple lead compounds, namely N-tosylL-arginine methyl ester (TAME, Fig. 1),15 and benzamidine;16 (ii) the electrophilic inhibitors (covalently bound) derived from the tripeptide motif (D)-Phe-Pro-Arg,17 with the peptide arginal Efegatran18 and the chloromethylene ketone PPACK,19 as leads. The only two synthetic thrombin inhibitors, Argatroban20 and Ximelagatran,21 available at the moment in the market for the treatment of coagulation complications were developed from the first class of inhibitors. In our context of biomaterials, the surface bound inhibitor is not allowed to be processed by the enzyme. We thus selected one representative of the first class as a model compound. We considered a simplified structure of Argatroban 1 (Fig. 1) featuring the following characteristics: (i) the guanidyl function of the L-arginine skeleton, for specific ionic interaction with Asp189 in the S1 enzyme pocket--since oral bioavailability14 is not a relevant problem in the field of hemocompatible materials, this strongly basic function could be maintained as a recognizing function; (ii) the lipophilic sulfonamide moiety, for interaction with the S2­S3 binding sites--this substituent was also used to introduce a trifluoromethyl group as a useful spectroscopic tag22 for XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis of the biomaterial surface and quantification of the amount of grafted inhibitor; (iii) the piperidinyl amide moiety (X = CH2 ), stable towards processing by the active serine of thrombin and blood esterases--it has been proven that the acid function placed on the piperidine ring of Argatroban is not absolutely necessary for

activity.14 Moreover, by removing the carboxylic acid and methyl group in the piperidine ring of Artagroban, we also avoided the control of two chiral centers. We further transformed the piperidine ring into a piperazine (X = NH) with the view to introduce a versatile anchorage point for different spacer arms, without creating a new chiral center. Thus, we chose to fix the spacer arm on the amide substituent; this was also the strategy selected by Ito and Imanishi23 who transformed the acid function of Argatroban into a polymerizable acrylamide residue. The effect of the piperazine motif on the activity, and the effect of the spacer arm on the positioning in the enzyme cavity, had to be controlled before using molecules 1 in our biomaterial application. Accordingly, we prepared the reference compound 1a, the parent compound 1b, and two derivatives 1c, and 1d, bearing respectively a short and a long spacer. The terminal function of the spacer is a primary amine for coupling to polymers displaying activated hydroxyl or carboxyl functions, following previously established protocols.22,24 2.2 Chemistry The target molecules 1 were constructed from protected arginine 2 (N-a-Boc-N-x-nitro-L-arginine) in five steps outlined in Scheme 1. After activation of the carboxyl function, piperidine (X = CH2 ), N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)piperazine (X = NCO2 Bn) and piperazines 8 and 13 (X = N­spacer­NH­CO2 PNB) were coupled to give the corresponding amides 3a­d (Table 1). After deprotection of the tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc), reaction of the free amine 4 with m-(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonyl chloride led to compounds 5a­d (Table 1). The final compounds 1a­d (Table 1) were isolated as acetate salts after cleavage of the protective groups by catalytic hydrogenation. Piperazines 8 and 13 equipped with the protected aminopropyl and aminododecyl spacers were independently prepared according to Scheme 2, by using classical chemistry. The piperazine carrying the C3 spacer was prepared from 3bromopropylamine by first protecting the amino group, then substitution of the bromine with Boc-piperazine, and finally Boc deprotection. For the preparation of the piperazine carrying the C12 spacer, the sequence starting from 12-aminododecanoic

The inhibition of human thrombin (K i ) by compounds 1a­ d was measured spectrophotometrically using as a competitor the chromogenic substrate H-D-phenylalanyl-L-pipecolyl-Larginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride (S-2238). The thrombin activity was evaluated from the hydrolysis rate of S-2238 measured at 405 nm (production of p-nitroaniline). All the compounds were active at the micromolar level, similarly to TAME (Table 2). The presence of a basic function on the amide substituent, and the use of this function to fix an amino-alkyl chain, did not significantly modify the activity. The effect of compounds 1a­d on clot formation on polymer materials surface was also evaluated with human whole blood. Two representative substrates were considered, a cell culture support made of PET and a blood filtration membrane made of

Compounds 1a­d were found to be active anticoagulants in our experimental conditions (about 100 nmol cm-2 of inhibitor on apparent support surface) reducing the weight of clot on both substrates by about 25%, while TAME was similarly active on PBT only.

Our purpose was to localize, by molecular modelling, the possible positions of the spacer arm of compounds 1 in the thrombin cavity. Indeed, after grafting on a solid support via the spacer terminus, the inhibitor should still be able to enter and fit in the enzyme active site. Thrombin is formed by an A chain of 36 amino acids and a B chain of 259 amino acids connected by a disulfur bridge. This enzyme contains the catalytic triad (Asp-102, His-57, Ser195) characteristic of the chymotrypsin family. Moreover, three important binding pockets have been identified: the specific pocket S1 with Asp-189, the hydrophobic proximal pocket S2 (also called P-pocket) and a larger hydrophobic distal pocket S3 (also called D-pocket).25,26 In our docking study, the coordinates of the human thrombin crystal structure complexed with Argatroban (1DWC in PDB) were used.27 In order to test the two docking algorithms (Autodock28 and Gold29 ), Argatroban was firstly docked in thrombin. The resulting complexes are in good agreement with the crystal structure (data not shown). The most active compound of the series, 1c, was then docked using the two methods. To account for amino acids flexibility of the active site, the solutions common to the two programs were then refined with the Discover3 module.30 Only the three water molecules close to the catalytic triad in the crystal complex were considered during the run. The geometry of the ligand was optimized in vacuo using quantum mechanics and particularly the HF/6-31+G(d,p). method and the 6-31+G** basis set (Gaussian98 program).31 The guanidyl and terminal amine groups of 1c were considered as protonated at physiological pH. The theoretical pK a of the piperazine moiety was calculated with the PALLAS program (CompuDrug Chemistry), and gave a value of 7.6 for the alkylamine. That means that about 50% of the ligand is not protonated. Here, we have considered this form but the conclusions are the same for the protonated state of the piperazine moiety. Two binding modes, being the two best ranked solutions of both programs, were identified (Fig. 2). In the first mode (A,

"internal"), the spacer points into the binding site of the enzyme, while in the second one (B, "external"), the spacer points toward the surface of the enzyme. In the "internal" mode, compound 1c approximately lay in the same orientation as Argatroban. The guanidyl function was close to Asp-189 in the S-pocket and interacted by H-bonding with Gly-219 and a water molecule. The lipophilic sulfonamide moiety lay in the D-pocket and the sulfone group interacted with Gly-219. The piperazine group and its spacer arm were buried in the P-pocket where H-bond was observed between Ser-195 and the amine group. The amide carbonyl moiety was also involved in H-bonding with Gly-216. In the "external" mode, the lipophilic sulfonamide and piperazine moieties were located in the P- and D-pockets respectively. The guanidyl function still lay in the S-pocket. The sulfone group was involved in H-bonding with Ser-195 and His57, and the amide carbonyl with Gly-219. The trifluoromethyl group interacted with Lys-60f and a water molecule; the protonated amine interacted with Glu-97a and was close to the enzyme surface. Moreover, p­p stacking interaction was observed between Trp-60d and the phenyl group. The two complexes were found to be stable and have very close binding energies, -79.2 and -79.6 kcal mol-1 respectively. Thus, the docking studies clearly showed that both orientations are possible from the energetic point of view. 2.5 X-Ray diffraction Several crystal structures27,32­36 of thrombin complexed with covalent and non -covalent inhibitors have been disclosed, since the seminal work of Bode et al.19 A single crystal of the novel compound 1c and human a-thrombin was prepared by using the hanging drop vapour diffusion technique, in the presence ° of hirudin peptide fragment; this crystal diffracted to 1.65 A resolution. In the X-ray complex structure, a well-defined electron density for the enzyme at the catalytic site and for the inhibitor was found (Fig. 3A). Not surprisingly, the binding mode of compound 1c

to the different pockets of the active site of a-thrombin was very similar to that of inhibitor MD-805 (Argatroban) as was described in structure 1DWC27 and was close to the "internal mode" described above (see superimposition in Fig. 4). Such experimental observation validates our theoretical approach. The orientation of compound 1c in the active site of athrombin is described in Fig. 3B and the compared distances in inhibitor binding are listed in Table 4. The guanidyl group (N22, N21 and N19) was oriented to the S-pocket but was unable to form H-bonds with the OD1 and OD2 groups of the Asp-189 side chain, as it is in the a-thrombin­Argatroban complex or in the "internal mode". The sulfonamide moiety lay in the Dpocket with the O24 atom of the sulfone group H-bonded to the amide backbone of Gly-219. The carbonyl O15 and amide N12 were both H-bonded to the peptidic backbone of Gly216, as described in the a-thrombin­Argatroban complex. In the "internal mode", Gly-216 was slightly shifted. Its carbonyl ° backbone is moved about 1 A from its position observed in the athrombin­Argatroban complex and further from the inhibitor amide N12 atom, resulting in the loss of the hydrogen bond. The loss of one hydrogen bond induced a different positioning of the piperazine cycle, bound in the P-pocket, in comparison with the two X-ray structures where it makes a hydrophobic interaction with the catalytic His-57. The spacer with its amine terminal group (N9) also had a different orientation in the X-ray structure compared to the model. While in the "internal mode" structure we observed H-bonding between the OG hydroxyl function of the active serine and the OE1 and OE2 groups of the Glu-192 side chain, the X-ray structure revealed an unexpected interaction with the NZ terminal amine group of the Lys-60f side chain. Since this spacer does not exist in Argatroban, this kind of interaction was unpredictable by theoretical methods. 2.6 Inhibitors grafting on surface

used in our laboratory for polymer functionalization.22 Chainend hydroxyl groups of PET and PBT membranes were activated with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl) and pyridine. The incubation of activated membranes with inhibitor solutions should provide sulfonyl ester displacement and covalent fixation of the active molecules on the surfaces (Scheme 3). The efficiency of the binding was verified by XPS analysis. Blank samples were prepared by processing samples without the activating agent p-toluenesulfonyl chloride. The F detection on blank samples could be attributed to unspecific adsorption. The corrected

values of F/C (difference between activated and blank samples) allowed the quantification of grafted inhibitors (Table 5). The fixation of compound 1c on both surfaces was not successful: on PET the difference in F detection on blank and activated samples (act) was not significant, while on PBT no F was detected. On the other hand, compound 1d resulted in a good level of fixation, with a higher ratio on PET than on PBT. From the F/C corrected values we could determine the concentration of grafted signals ° in the interface domain analyzed by XPS (50­100 A depth or about 10 atomic layers).

transformed into pmol cm-2 as previously described for PET.37 Indeed this membrane is dense, regular and semi-crystalline.

The PBT membrane is tortuous and highly porous; the lack of crystallographic and density data in this case did not allow a similar calculation of surface molecular concentration. The different morphology of the two polymers may explain the systematically lower fixation ratios observed in the web-like PBT membrane in comparison with the smooth PET membrane. Grafting phenomena occur in the solvent accessible surface of the membrane (open surface) that, in the case of the particular morphology of the considered PBT membrane, may not coincide with the XPS analyzed portion of the sample. Indeed, grafted signals, mostly present in the polymer matrix for instance, could be underestimated by the spectroscopic analysis. The evaluation of materials hemocompatibility was performed by measuring the weight of clot formed on the supports after static incubation with blood in standardized conditions. The blood clot formation on samples grafted with compound 1d was found to be systematically lower than on blank samples (Table 6). The decrease in blood clot formation was more important on PBT (around 24%) than on PET (7%). No effect on blood clot formation was observed on samples treated with compound 1c. This finding was not surprising as low fixation of 1c was detected on PET and no fixation at all was observed on PBT.

Conclusion

Although significantly less active than Argatroban, the designed inhibitors 1 were found to be sufficiently active for our biomaterial application. The lack of condensed piperidine ring on the N-terminal sulfonyl benzene group, and carboxyl and methyl groups on the C-terminal piperidine ring, in fact caused a weaker inhibition potency. However the activities were found to be similar to amide derivatives of N,a-substituted-L-arginine precursors of Argatroban15 and benzamidine derivatives developed for material hemocompatibilization.9 Our novel thrombin inhibitors were designed to be grafted on the surface of biomaterials via a spacer arm, either short (compound 1c) or long (compound 1d). From docking and Xray studies, two potential binding modes of 1c in thrombin were identified. The docking studies clearly showed that both orientations are possible, from an energetic point of view. Indeed,

the two complexes are stable and have very similar binding energies. The second mode, called "external mode", where the molecular spacer is close to the enzyme surface, showed that the grafted inhibitor would still be able to bind the active site of thrombin. Docking studies of analogues of 1c bearing longer spacers ((CH2 )4 and (CH2 )5 ) were also performed and confirmed the possibility of observing both the A (internal) and B (external) modes of binding (data not shown). Interestingly, for those longer spacers, even in the so-called "internal mode" observed experimentally, the spacer was also able to join the enzyme surface by displacing Trp-60d (data not shown). The same situation should occur with compound 1d bearing a (CH2 )12 spacer arm. Moreover, from biological data, we observed that the substitution of a CH2 group with a NH function in position 4 of the piperidine ring, as well as the introduction in the same position of a spacer arm, does not change significantly the activity of the inhibitor (Table 1). All the experimental and theoretical results confirmed our initial hypothesis that an inhibitor carrying a suitable spacer arm in position 4 of the piperazinyl-amide moiety should be able to enter and fit the active site of thrombin providing the specific biological activity that we required for the development of blood-compatible materials. The grafting of our synthetic thrombin inhibitors on a polyester surface was performed and validated by XPS thanks to the incorporation of a fluorine tag into their structures: fixation of compound 1d with a long spacer was more efficient than the grafting of 1c equipped with a short arm. Moreover, due to the morphology of the polymers chosen as models for this study, the ratio of PET surface derivatization was higher than that of PBT. The grafting of compound 1d on both PET and PBT membranes was found to reduce significantly the blood clot formation. The inhibitor bound on the surface is still active and its surface concentration of about 90 pmol cm-2 seems to be sufficient to inhibit the coagulation cascade. Modification of the grafting protocol and other surface activation techniques are under investigation to increase the surface concentration of bioactive signals and hopefully improve the materials performance. Nevertheless, the proposed technique appeared to be a very promising method for the development of hemocompatible polymer materials, by mild, non-aggressive wet-chemistry treatments.

4. Experimental
4.1 Chemistry Reagents and solvents were purchased from Acros Chimica, Aldrich or Fluka. Tetrahydrofuran was dried over sodium/benzophenone, then distilled. Column chromatography was carried out with silica gel 60 (70­230 mesh ASTM) supplied by Merck. The IR spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer 1710 instrument, only the most significant adsorption bands being reported. The mass spectra were obtained with a Finnigan MAT TSQ-70 instrument. The high resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were performed at the University of Mons, Belgium (Professor R. Flammang). The microanalyses were performed at the Christopher Ingold Laboratories of University College, London (Dr A. Stones). The melting points were determined with an Electrothermal microscope and are uncorrected. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Gemini 300 (at 300 MHz for proton and 75 MHz for carbon) or Bruker AM500 spectrometers (at 500 MHz for proton and 125 MHz for carbon); the chemical shifts were reported in ppm (d) downfield from tetramethylsilane (TMS). 4.1.1 General procedure for the preparation of 5-(3-nitroguanidino)-2(S)-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-1-(azacyclohexan-1-yl)pentan-1-one (3a­c).

(10 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The solution was concentrated at reduced pressure and the obtained orange gel was suspended and triturated in Et2 O until precipitation of the trifluoroacetate salt as a crystalline solid occurred. The precipitate was washed with Et2 O and used directly in the next reaction (quantitative yield). For spectroscopic analysis the product was converted to the free amine by dissolution in NaOH 1 N, and extraction of the aqueous solution with EtOAc (about 90% product recovery). 2(S)-Amino-5-nitroguanidino-1-(piperidin-1-yl)pentan-1-one (4a).

The polymer materials considered were poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) track-etched micro-porous membrane (Whatman S.A., thickness 12 lm, density 1.39 g cm-3 , pore diameter 0.49 lm, pore density 1.45 × 106 pore cm-2 ) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) melt blown filtration membrane (Johns Manville, thickness 133 lm, mean flow pore 5 lm, basis weight 82 gsm). The surface chemical composition of the derivatized polymers was determined by XPS with a SSX 100/206 photoelectron spectrometer from Surface Science Instruments (USA) equipped with a monochromatized microfocus Al X-ray source (powered at 20 mA and 10 kV). The pressure in the analysis chamber was around 10-6 Pa. The angle between the surface normal and the axis of the analyser lens was 55 . The analysed area was approximately 1.4 mm2 and the pass energy was set at 150 eV. In these conditions, the resolution determined by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Au 4f7/2 peak was around 1.6 eV. A flood gun set at 10 eV and a Ni grid placed 3 mm above the sample surface were used for charge stabilization. The binding energies were calculated with respect to the C­(C,H) component of the C 1s peak fixed at 284.8 eV. Data treatment was performed with the CasaXPS program (Casa Software Ltd, UK). Molar fractions were calculated using peak areas normalised on the basis of acquisition parameters and sensitivity factors provided by the manufacturer. 4.2.1 Activation and coupling.

The polymer samples (10 disks) were stirred at 20  C (PBT) or 60  C (PET) for 1 h into a mixture of acetone (50 mL), pyridine (1.06 mL) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (2.5 g). The samples were washed successively with acetone (50 mL, 5 min) and water (50 mL, 5 min). The resulted activated samples (15) were individually immersed in 1 mL of a 10-3 M solution of inhibitor in a phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.2)­CH3 CN mixture (1 : 1) and incubated for 2 h at 20  C with shaking. The samples were washed with PBS­CH3 CN (1 mL, 2 × 10 min), water (1 mL, 2 × 5 min), 5 × 10-3 M HCl (1 mL, 2 × 5 min) and water (1 mL, 2 × 10 min). The resulting inhibitor grafted membranes (16) were finally dried over filter paper and analysed by XPS within 24 h. The blank samples were prepared in the same way but without addition of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the activation step. 4.2.2 XPS analysis. The surface molar fractions were measured by XPS analysis. The concentration of F tagged

molecules on the surface was calculated from the F/C ratio. Considering for instance the polymer repeat unit of PET ­ CO­C6 H4 ­CO2 ­CH2 CH2 ­O­ (C10 H8 O4 ) and the derivatized (by grafting of compound 1d) chain unit ­CO­C6 H4 ­CO2 ­ CH2 CH2 ­1d (C39 H57 F3 N7 O6 S) we calculated the percentage of derivatized units as follows. For a mixture of 96.7% (C10 H8 O4 ) and 3.3% (C39 H57 F3 N7 O6 S), F/C × 100 = 9.9 × 100/1095.7 = 0.904 (experimental value 0.900). Similarly, the corrected F/C value of 0.005 for compound 1d on PBT gave a derivatization ratio of 1.9%. We previously calculated on the basis of PET crystallographic data and simple geometrical considerations37 an average of 1.72 × 1015 PET monomer units per cm2 of surface covering 10 atomic layers (the depth analysed by XPS) or about 2850 pmol cm-2 . Thus, 3.3% of derivatized surface monomer units corresponds to about 90 pmol cm-2 of fixed compound 1d. In the same way we calculated a surface concentration of compound 1c of about 10 pmol cm-2 for a corrected F/C value of 0.001 (0.4% derivatization). The lack of crystallographic data on the PBT membrane did not allow an analogue calculation of signal surface concentration. 4.3 Biological assays 4.3.1 Enzyme kinetics. Substrate H-D-phenylalanyl-Lpipecolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride (S2238) was obtained from Chromogenix. Human thrombin was obtained from Hypen BioMed. Enzyme kinetics studies were performed on a Cary210 spectrophotometer. The inhibition activities were measured by adapting the protocol developed by Lottemberg et al.:38 100 lL of the solution of substrate S2238 (0.1 mM in water) and 100 lL of water solution of the tested compound (50­200 lM final concentration) were diluted in 2 mL of Tris-Hepes Buffer (Tris 0.01 M, Hepes 0.01 M, NaCl 0.5 M, PEG 6000 0.1% m/v, pH 7.8). Finally 10 lL of water solution of thrombin (10 NIH mL-1 , 75.2 nM) were added to start the reaction. The appearance of the substrate hydrolysis product (p-nitroaniline) was measured at 405 nm as a function of time. Plots of V /V i versus inhibitor concentration (ratio of hydrolysis in the absence and in the presence of inhibitors) gave the inhibition constants indicated in Table 2. 4.3.2 Clot formation. For the evaluation of material hemocompatibility we used a simple test based on the weight measurement of the blood clot formed on given substrates (polymer squares of 4 × 4 cm fixed on a cylindrical glass support of 2.6 cm internal diameter) after blood contact and incubation. Human blood was withdrawn from a healthy volunteer, collected in citrated tubes and used within a day. For coating experiments 200 lL of a 10-3 M solution of the tested compound were placed on the polymer surface that was then dried overnight. After weighing the samples, 200 lL of human blood were placed on the surface, 20 lL of CaCl2 were added to start coagulation and the samples were incubated statically for 1.5 h at 37  C in a saturated water atmosphere and 5% CO2 . The samples were then washed with water (3 × 2 mL), the clot was fixed with formaldehyde (2 mL of a 5% solution in water) and then washed with water (2 mL). The samples were dried in oven (37  C) until constant weight. The sample weight differences gave the weight of the formed clot. Native polymer coated with heparin (Leo, 5000 I.E./U.I./mL, 200 lL) was used as anti-clotting reference sample. 4.4 Docking study Molecular modelling studies were performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane2 workstation. Gold implements a genetic algorithm allowing the protein­ ligand docking with full ligand and partial protein flexibility. Indeed, conformation of some amino acids (Ser, Thr and Lys) are optimized during the run. The energy function is partly based

on conformational and non-bonded contact information from the CSD database. Parameters: Popsiz = 100; maxops = 100000; niche size = 2. Autodock uses a hybrid method called Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (genetic algorithm coupled with a local search) to predict the interaction of flexible ligands with rigid macromolecular targets. The scoring function includes van der Waals, coulombic electrostatic, directional hydrogen bonding, entropy of ligand binding and desolvation contributions. Parameters: Runs = 200; Population size = 50; Number of generations = 27000. Discover3 uses the molecular mechanics to optimize the conformation of the ligand­protein complex and evaluate the interaction energy (the enthalpic contribution of the binding) which is the sum of coulombic and van der Waals terms (DE cb and DE vdw ). The backbone is moved following force constants; side chains and water molecules move freely. Forcefield: CVFF; Dielectric constant: 1*r; Criteria convergence: 10 kcal mol-1 for the Steepest Descent algorithm, 0.01 for the Conjugate Gradient one. The thrombin amino acid residues were numbered by the chymotrypsin(ogen) numbering system as suggested by Bode et al.19 4.5 Crystallization, data collection and structure refinement

Human a-thrombin was obtained from Kordia Life Sciences (Leiden, The Netherlands) and its anion-binding exosite inhibitor, the hirudin peptide fragment (54­65), was obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Crystals of human athrombin were grown in the presence of hirudin and compound 1c using the hanging drop vapour diffusion technique at 293 K. Prior to the crystallization, the protein was solubilized to approximately 10 mg ml-1 in 0.36 M NaCl, 96 mM pH 6.5 citrate buffer, containing hirudin at a concentration of 3 mM. Drops were prepared by mixing 1 ll of protein solution with 1 ll of compound 1c at a final concentration of 2.9 mM to 1 ll of reservoir solution. The reservoir solution contained 20% PEGMME 5000, 0.36 M NaCl in 0.1 M HEPES buffer pH 7.5. Compound 1c was additionally further diffused into the crystal for 72 h from a 44 mM solution containing 22% PEGMME 5000 and 0.36 M NaCl to a final concentration of 16 mM. One crystal was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after rapid soaking in a cryoprotectant solution containing about 50% glycerol in the crystallization buffer. Data were collected at ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, ° France) on beamline BM30a at a wavelength value of 0.9797 A. All data were recorded on a MarCCD detector, and intensities were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM version 6.01.39 This single crystal, belonging to space group C2 with unit cell ° ° ° dimensions a = 70.51 A, b = 71.34 A, c = 72.56 A and b = ° 100.59 , diffracted to 1.65 A resolution. The scaling of the intensity data was accomplished with SCALA of the CCP4 program suite,40 and all corresponding statistics are given in Table 7. The phasing procedure for solving the structure was the molecular replacement method using the AMoRe package.41 The structure of the complex human a-thrombin/hirugen (PDB code 1HTG)42 was used as the search model for the rotation and translation searches. Model building with TURBO-FRODO43 and refinement with CNS 1.144 gave final overall crystallographic R factors of 24.3% (working) and 27.2% (free), with values in the outer shell of 27.5% and 31.7%, respectively, for 2333 protein atoms, 34 inhibitor atoms and 187 water molecules. The statistics of refinement are summarized in Table 7. The inhibitor density was very clear as shown in Fig. 3A: the refined temperature ° factors for the inhibitor range from 15 (O15 atom) to 30 A2 . Co-ordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1W7G). Figures were prepared with MOLSCRIPT/RASTER3D.45
