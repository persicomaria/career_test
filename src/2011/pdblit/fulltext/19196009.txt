To understand the role of specific active site residues in conferring selective dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition from pathogenic organisms such as Pneumocystis carinii (pc) or Pneumocystis jiroVecii (pj), the causative agent in AIDS pneumonia, it is necessary to evaluate the role of these residues in the human enzyme. We report the first kinetic parameters for DHFR from pjDHFR and pcDHFR with methotrexate (MTX), trimethoprim (TMP), and its potent analogue, PY957. We also report the mutagenesis and kinetic analysis of active site mutant proteins at positions 35 and 64 of human (h) DHFR and the crystal structure determinations of hDHFR ternary complexes of NADPH and PY957 with the wild-type DHFR enzyme, the single mutant protein, Gln35Lys, and two double mutant proteins, Gln35Ser/Asn64Ser and Gln35Ser/Asn64Phe. These substitutions place into human DHFR amino acids found at those sites in the opportunistic pathogens pcDHFR (Q35K/N64F) and pjDHFR (Q35S/N64S). The Ki inhibition constant for PY957 showed greatest potency of the compound for the N64F single mutant protein (5.2 nM), followed by wild-type pcDHFR (Ki 22 nM) and then wild-type hDHFR enzyme (Ki 230 nM). Structural data reveal significant conformational changes in the binding interactions of PY957 in the hDHFR Q35S/N64F mutant protein complex compared to the other hDHFR mutant protein complexes and the pcDHFR ternary complex. The conformation of PY957 in the wild-type DHFR is similar to that observed for the single mutant protein. These data support the hypothesis that the enhanced selectivity of PY957 for pcDHFR is in part due to the contributions at positions 37 and 69 (pcDHFR numbering). This insight will help in the design of more selective inhibitors that target these opportunistic pathogens.
The atypical fungus Pneumocystis jiroVecii (pj)1 is an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP), one of the most prevalent opportunistic infections in patients with HIV AIDS (1-3). Current treatment of PcP combines the sulfa drug sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim (TMP) (Figure 1) that targets folate biosynthesis (1, 4). Initial characterization of pjDHFR derived from patients with HIV AIDS (5) showed that it was similar to Pneumocystis carinii (pcDHFR) found in rat lungs but showed significant sequence differences (Table 1). These data also showed that TMP was a weak competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 2.8 × 10-7 M. In contrast, MTX was a tight-binding competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 1.6 × 10-11 M (5).

ABSTRACT:

Recent studies have also shown the emergence of TMP drug resistance related to mutations in DHFR. For example, in a study of patients with PcP, some treated with a DHFR inhibitor and some with no prophylaxis, 19 DHFR nucleotide substitution sites were observed in 18 patients, with 16 of these sites giving rise to mutations (6). These data suggest that different P. jiroVecii populations with alternate forms of the target enzyme may arise with selective pressure from DHFR inhibitors. Since P. jiroVecii cannot be grown in culture and will not reproduce in experimental animals, most drug design efforts have targeted DHFR from P. carinii found in rat lungs (7-10). Although these two forms of DHFR are similar, they differ in their drug sensitivity. These differences provide an opportunity to design selective drugs that target a specific

species of enzyme. This will of necessity require careful consideration of crucial differences in the active sites among these two fungal enzymes and human DHFR. Of note is the variability observed among the human and fungal enzyme sequences in the active site, in particular residues at positions 35 and 64 (hDHFR numbering, Table 1).2 In the human enzyme these residues are Gln and Asn, while in pcDHFR they are Lys and Phe, and Ser and Ser in pjDHFR. Structural data for inhibitor binding to h- or pcDHFR reveals that these residues interact with antifolates (11) and that inhibitors can be designed to target interactions with these residues (9-11). In order to assess the role of active site variants among the pathogenic DHFR enzymes, whether as single or double mutant proteins, it is important to understand the role of these residues in giving rise to TMP resistance by weaker binding or in giving rise to enhanced native-like activity (12, 13). In a study to screen for MTX resistance of hDHFR, synergistic resistance could be obtained by combining two or more active site mutations that confer weak MTX resistance (12). In the combinatorial libraries that were created for positions 31, 34, and 35, mutations of Gln35 were observed that

reflected the residues for pc- and pjDHFR (i.e., Q35K, Q35S). Neither of these mutations caused MTX resistance. Recent studies have also suggested that the effect of double mutants in an active site may be additive, partially additive, synergistic, antagonistic, or absent (14). Efforts to produce more selective and potent antifolates that target pcDHFR led to the design of novel 2,4-diamino5-(-carboxyalky)oxy trimethoprim analogue that showed 80-5000-fold increase in potency (IC50) over the mammalian enzyme (15). We used PY957 (Figure 1), a potent and selective compound from this series, to explore the critical differences in the active sites of mammalian and Pneumocystis DHFR. Herein we report the first kinetic analysis of recombinant pjDHFR, pcDHFR, and hDHFR and for a larger series of active site mutants of hDHFR designed to explore sequence differences between the human and the two Pneumocystis enzymes (Tables 1, 2, and 3), and the potent inhibitors, methotrexate (MTX), trimethoprim (TMP), and its analogue, PY957. Additionally, we report the crystal structures of human DHFR bearing the single amino acid substitution (Q35K) and hDHFR bearing two double sub-

stitutions (Q35S/N64S and Q35S/N64F), as ternary complexes with NADPH and PY957. The crystal structure of PY957 with wild-type pcDHFR has been reported (16). Taken together, these data enrich our understanding of the role of DHFR active site residues in conferring species selectivity and specificity of antifolate binding. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression and Purification of pj- and pcDHFR. The cDNA for pj- or pcDHFR was transfected into Escherichia coli Rosetta Gami B (DE3) competent cells with pETSUMO-DHFR plasmid for expression. The general expression protocol is to inoculate a 10 mL culture of Luria broth (LB) containing ampicillin (AMP), grown overnight at 37 °C, inoculate 1 L of LB containing antibiotic, and grow at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6-0.8. The cells are then induced with isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM, shaken overnight at 16 °C, and harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 12000g. The cell pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer (100 mL of ice-cold buffer containing 6.8 g of KH2PO4 and 3.7 g of KCl dissolved in 900 mL of H2O, and 1.0 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH before bringing the volume to 1 L) and the cells broken using a microfluidizer at 18000 psi (Microfluidics, Inc.). The SUMO fusion protein has the His tag for Ni-column purification. The tag is removed by the SUMO protease (17), leaving a native protein. A two-step purification protocol using a Ni-chelating IMAC for removal of the His-tagged protein, followed by

Ulp1 protease cleavage, and passage over a second IMAC column resulted in a yield of 20-30 mg of purified enzyme from 1 L of culture. Construction and Expression of Mutant Human DHFR. Mutations were introduced into the cDNA of hDHFR, and the entire coding sequence was verified by Roswell Park Cancer Center (Buffalo, NY). DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and used without further purification. Plasmid DNA was purified using the plasmid mini kit (Qiagen). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All primers were PAGE purified and were synthesized by Alpha DNA (Montreal, Quebec) or IDT (Coralville, IA). Primers were designed according to manufacturer's recommendations as were the PCR reactions, with adjustments made for the Tm of the respective primer. PCR (50 ng of dsDNA template, 100 ng of each primer, 5 mM dNTPs, 2.5 units/µL Taq): 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 3 min.

hDHFR Active Site Mutants, Structure and Kinetics The original wild-type human DHFR (pDS5 vector) was used for PCR and all subsequent mutagenesis experiments. Four single mutants were created (Q35K, Q35S, N64F, and N64S) with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Four double mutant proteins (Q35K/N64F, Q35S/N64F, Q35K/ N64S, Q35S/N64S) were created by using parental template DNA having one confirmed single residue mutation and using primers for the second desired mutation during PCR. Expression and Purification of Human DHFR pDS5/ Mutant pDS5. The following protocol was used for expression of wild-type (wt) human DHFR (18) and mutant human DHFR in the pDS5 vector in E. coli BL21(DE3): 200 mL of LB medium containing 100 µg/mL AMP was inoculated with glycerol stock of hDHFR at 37 °C with shaking at 300 rpm overnight. One liter of fresh LB/AMP was inoculated with the 200 mL culture overnight and grown at 37 °C at 300 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.8-0.9. Cells were then induced with 2 mM IPTG overnight at 16 °C (16-18 h) and harvested by centrifugation at 13000g. Cells were resuspended in 100 mL of ice-cold M9 salt solution (12.8 g of Na2HPO4 · 7H20, 3 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 1 g of NH4Cl in a volume of 1 L). Cells were lysed in 100 mL of ice-cold buffer containing 6.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.7 g of KCl, dissolved in 900 mL of H2O, 1.0 mL of 1.0 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with KOH before bringing the volume to 1 L. Cells were disrupted by passing through a microfluidizer at 18000 psi (Microfluidics, Inc.). The resulting lysate was subjected to centrifugation for 30 min at 7000g. Ammonium sulfate was added to supernatant over a period of 60 min to a final saturation of 85% at 0 °C. Precipitated protein was centrifuged for 30 min at 7000g and the pellet resuspended in 50 mL of methotrexate column binding buffer (100 mM KCl, 50 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.0). The resulting sample was passed over a 25 mL methotrexate affinity column (18). The column was extensively washed (>5 column volumes of buffer) to remove unbound protein. DHFR was subsequently eluted in 5 mL fractions by passing a solution of 4 mM folic acid and 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, over the column. SDS-PAGE was performed on fractions to determine which contained DHFR. The appropriate fractions were then pooled and dialyzed extensively against DEAE column buffer (50 mM K2PO4, pH 7.5) to remove folic acid from the solution. On the following day the sample was applied to a 120 mL DEAE ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare). All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing highly pure (>95%) DHFR were pooled, concentrated to 1 mg/mL, flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Kinetic Analysis. Standard DHFR assays were conducted using a standard 1 cm path-length cuvette at 37 °C with continuous recording of change of OD at 340 nM. The assay contained 41 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, 8.9 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mM KCl, and saturating concentrations of NADPH and dihydrofolic acid (DHFA). With human DHFR, DHFA concentrations were 18 or 90 µM DHFA; 117 µM NADPH was used. The optimal level of DHFA for each protein was determined and selected to give maximal activity without approaching levels that might be inhibitory. Because Ki values take into account the amount of substrate in the assay, these differences do not affect the

Biochemistry, Vol. 48, No. 8, 2009 1705 final value. Initial rates of enzyme activity were measured; rates were linear under standard conditions for about 5 min for human DHFR. Activity was linearly related to protein concentration under these conditions of assay. Km values were determined by holding either substrate or cofactor at a constant, saturating concentration and varying the other over a range of concentrations. The Km value was determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression methods (Prism 4.0). The value of kcat was determined from the Vmax value and the protein concentration (kcat ) Vmax[Etot]) (Table 2). Ki values were determined by measuring inhibition of the reaction at two or more concentrations of substrate (DHFA). For the competitive inhibitors such as trimethoprim, Ki could be calculated from the equation: Ki ) IC50/(1 + S/Km) Methotrexate followed the pattern of a tight-binding inhibitor (18), and PY957 inhibition best fit a linear mixed model (19). All determinations of IC50 were made by fitting percent inhibition data to a single site sigmoidal model with variable slope, using nonlinear regression methods (Prism 4.0). All inhibition curves required at least four points within the central segment of the sigmoidal curve. Statistical comparisons were preformed with InStat 2.03, using the nonparametric Welch t test because variances among groups could not be shown to be equal; this test is more conservative than the standard t test. These results are shown in Table 3. The values in the tables represent mean ( standard error of the mean when replicates are three or more; when n ) 1 or 2, the values are the mean (s standard error for the curve fitting. Additional graphical representations of these kinetic data are illustrated in Figures 1S and 2S of the Supporting Information. Crystallization. Buffers for the Q35K single mutant protein and the Q35S/N64F and Q35S/N64S double mutant proteins of human DHFR were exchanged in a Centricon 10000 MWCO filter with 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer, pH 6.9, and concentrated to 4.2 mg/mL for the single mutant protein and 6.6 mg/mL for the double mutant proteins of hDHFR. The protein was incubated with NADPH and a 10:1 molar excess of the inhibitor, PY957, for 1 h over ice prior to crystallization using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using siliconized glass coverslips. The 10 µL protein droplets that contained a final protein buffer of 100 mM K2HPO4, pH 6.9, with 30% saturated ammonium sulfate were suspended over a reservoir solution of 100 mM K2HPO4, pH 6.9, and 60% saturated ammonium sulfate with 3% (v/v) ethanol. Samples were stored at 14 °C, and crystals grew in about 3 days and were trigonal, space group R3 in the H3 hexagonal setting. A data set for the single Q35K mutant protein hDHFR ternary complex was collected on a Rigaku RaxisIV imaging plate system with MaxFlux optics to 1.8 Å resolution, and a second, higher resolution data set was collected to 1.45 Å resolution using the remote access protocol on beam line 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) facility (20-22). Only data from SSRL are reported for the single mutant. Data for the wild-type hDHFR ternary complex with PY957 and NADPH were also collected to 1.2 Å resolution on beam line 9-2 at SSRL. Data were collected on the Rigaku RaxisIV imaging plate system to 1.90-2.0 Å resolution for the two double mutants of the

hDHFR ternary complex with NADPH and PY957. All data were processed using Mosflm (23). Diffraction statistics are shown in Table 4 for all complexes. Structure Determination. The structures were solved by molecular replacement methods using the coordinates for wild-type human DHFR (1U72) (24) in the program Molref (23). Inspection of the resulting difference electron density maps was made using the program COOT (25) running on a Mac G5 workstation and revealed density for a ternary complex for all structures (Figure 2). To monitor the refinement, a random subset of all reflections was set aside for the calculation of Rfree (5%). The model for the inhibitor was taken from the coordinates of the pcDHFR-NADPHPY957 ternary complex (16). The parameter file for the cofactor and inhibitor was prepared using the Dundee PRODGR2ServerWebsite(http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/ programs/prodrg) (26). The final cycles of refinement were carried out using the program Refmac5 in the CCP4 suite of programs (23). The Ramachandran conformational parameters from the last cycle of refinement generated by PROCHECK (27) showed that more than 90% of the residues in all complexes have the most favored conformation and none are in the disallowed regions (Table 4). Coordinates for these structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession numbers 3f8y, 3f87, 3f91, and 3fs6 for the hDHFR structures listed in Table 4).

RESULTS Steady-State Kinetic Parameters. The parameters reported in Table 2 give the overall effect of mutations on catalytic activity.ThereisnosignificantdeparturefromMichaelis-Menten kinetics observed for any of the variants. The Km values for DHFA and NADPH for hDHFR (Table 2) are somewhat greater than previously reported values of 0.12 and 0.16 µM, respectively (28-31); however, our values were determined at 37 °C in the presence of 150 mM KCl, and the cited values were measured at 20 °C in the presence of NaCl, which likely accounts for the differences. The data in Table 2 show Km values for DHFA are similar for pjDHFR, hDHFR, and its mutant proteins Q35S and Q35S/N64S. The mutant proteins Q35K, N64S, N64F, and Q35K/N64F all have lower Km values for DHFA than either wild-type human or wild-type pcDHFR. The values of kcat previously reported for hDHFR range from 6.9 to 11 s-1, assayed at 20 °C (28-31), and are generally in line with the value of 40 s-1 we measured at 37 °C.

The Ki for all variants at positions 35 and 64 were determined for TMP, MTX, and PY957 (Table 3). Mutant protein for N64S DHFR had a Ki value for MTX statistically significantly lower than that of hDHFR. Mutant proteins Q35S and Q35S/N64S hDHFR showed Ki values for MTX that were identical to

the value for pjDHFR but were not statistically significantly lower than the Ki for hDHFR. In contrast, all mutant proteins converting hDHFR to a more pc-like active site (Q35K, N64F, Q35K/N64S) showed values near that of wild-type pcDHFR and were statistically lower than the value for hDHFR. Ki values for TMP are in general agreement with the values reported from enzyme taken from AIDS patients (Table 3) (5). The Ki values for TMP were statistically significantly lower than the value for hDHFR in the Q35S, N64S, and Q35S/N64S mutant protein series but were not as low as the value for native pjDHFR. In contrast, hDHFR mutants Q35K, N64F, and Q35K/N64F showed Ki values that were statistically lower than the value for hDFHR but not significantly different than the value for pcDHFR. These results suggest that the selectivity of interaction of TMP with DHFR depends heavily on the residues at positions 35 and 64. However, structural data reported for the ternary complex of pcDHFR with NADPH and TMP indicate few interactions of TMP with Lys37 and Phe69 (32).

The Ki values for PY957 follow a pattern similar to that of TMP: mutant Q35S/N64S has a Ki value lower than hDHFR but higher than pjDHFR, and all Ki values for mutant hDHFR with pcDHFR substitutions (Q35K, N64F, Q35K/ N64F) are significantly lower than the value for hDHFR but not significantly different from the Ki for pcDHFR. These results suggest that PY957 exploits some of the same interactions as TMP to achieve selectivity. OVerall Structure and Ligand Binding Conformation. The Q35S/N64S doubly substituted mutant protein hDHFR was designed to make the active site of the human enzyme more like the active site of pjDHFR while the single Q35K single mutant protein makes that position like that of the pcDHFR active site, whereas the Q35S/N64F double mutant protein is a cross between the pc- and pjDHFR sequences at these positions. Overall, the structures of these mutant proteins resemble those previously reported for hDHFR and preserve the previously reported hydrogen bond network involving structural water, the conserved residues Thr136, Trp24, Glu30,andtheN1nitrogenand2-aminogroupofPY957(28-30).

FIGURE 3: Stereoview of the superposition of the hDHFR-NADPH-PY957 ternary complexes with Q35K (violet), the Q35S/N64S double mutant (cyan), the Q35S/N64F double mutant (green), wild-type hDHFR (pink), and the pcDHFR wild type-NADPH-PY957 ternary complex (yellow) (16). The wild-type structure has nearly the same conformation as the single mutant protein. Figure was drawn with PyMol (33).

Similarly, the 4-amino group of PY957 maintains contact with the conserved residues Ile7 and Tyr121 and NADPH. The binding orientation of the diaminopyrimidine ring of PY957 is similar to that observed in the pcDHFR ternary structure (16). The conformation of PY957 in the hDHFR wild-type and mutant protein complexes differs significantly from that observed in the pcDHFR ternary inhibitor complex (Figure 5) (16). Comparison of the torsion angle rotation about the C5-C51 and C51-C1 bonds (Figure 1, Table 5) reveals that the two ring systems are mutually perpendicular, in contrast to that observed in the pcDHFR complex (16). This conformation of PY957 in the hDHFR mutant protein complexes positions the 2-methoxy carbon such that it makes hydrophobic contact with the methyl carbon of Thr56 (3.0, 3.5, and 3.4 Å for the single Q35K and double Q35S/N64F and Q35S/N64S mutants, respectively), with the side chain of Val115 (4.1, 3.7, and 3.7 Å), and to the nicotinamide ring of NADPH (3.6, 4.0, and 3.8 Å). The 2-methoxy oxygen makes contact with the backbone carbonyl of Val115 (3.4, 3.8, and 3.7 Å, respectively). In the pcDHFR complex with PY957 (16), these contacts are to Leu25 (4.0 Å), Thr61 (4.8 Å), and the nicotinamide ring (3.7 Å). There are also significant differences in the conformation among the "(5--carboxyalkyoxy)" side chains of PY957 observed in all the variant complexes of hDHFR (Table 5 and Figure 3). In the Q35K structure that has Lys35 and Asn64 in the binding pocket, the methylene carbons of the side chain of PY957 are extended and make weak hydrophobic contacts to the Lys35 and Asn64 (3.9-4.8 Å). In the case of the Q35S/N64S double mutant, these residues are both Ser, and the side chain methylene carbons are folded such that they are closer to Leu60 and Ser59 (3.3-4.3 Å, respectively) (Figure 3). In the cross-species variant Q35S/ N64F, the side chain conformation has changed significantly and is positioned between Phe31 and Phe64 rather than forming interactions with the conserved Arg70 as in the other mutant structures (Figure 4). The corresponding residue in pcDHFR is Phe69 (pcDHFR numbering), that can contribute strong hydrophobic interactions to the methylene carbons of the inhibitor side chain (16). Thus, although the two mutant hDHFR forms and pcDHFR differ in the way they interact

FIGURE 4: Stereoview of the interactions of the PY957 side chain in the active site of the double mutant protein Q35S/N64F of hDHFR illustrating the hydrophobic contacts made between Phe31 and Phe64 of the mutant protein and the methylene carbons of the PY957 side chain. This conformation has the side chain flipped such that the carboxylate oxygen atoms no longer interact with Arg70 as observed in the other PY957 structures.

with the methylene carbons in the side chain of PY957, the single Q35K and Q35S/N64S double mutants retain these interactions to some extent. The position of the side chain of the conserved Arg70 is maintained by a network of hydrogen bond contacts from the side chains of residues Thr38 and Thr39 and from the backbone functional groups of Lys68 (16). As expected, the carboxylate group of PY957 forms close contacts to the conserved Arg70 in hDHFR Q35K and Q35S/N64S variant complexes; however, in the case of the Q35S/N64F double mutant, there is an unexpected change in the inhibitor side chain conformation such that it no longer makes contact with Arg70. In this complex, the inhibitor carboxylate interactions are replaced by water molecules (Figure 2c). The carboxylate oxygen atoms of PY957 in this alternate conformation make weak interactions with water molecules near the surface of the enzyme. The side chain may be disordered as the B-values for thermal motion for the methylene carbons of the side chain are nearly twice (about 30) those in the remaining structure. In all the mutant protein DHFR structures, NADPH is fully occupied and is bound in an extended conformation similar to other DHFR cofactor complexes (11, 16). In the case of

the wild-type hDHFR ternary complex, the cofactor is partially occupied in the extended conformation. The carboxamide group of the nicotinamide rings, which is syn to the nicotinamide ring N, makes a series of strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of the conserved residues Ile7 and Val115 in hDHFR. The conserved cis peptide linkage between the invariant Gly117 and Gly118 permits the pyrophosphate oxygen atoms of the cofactor to interact. DISCUSSION This is the first report of the kinetic and structural parameters for the pjDHFR and for the single and double variants at positions 35 and 64 of hDHFR that make the human enzyme resemble the DHFR from the two opportunistic pathogens from Pneumocystis, i.e., Q35K and N64F for human to pcDHFR and Q35S and N64S for human to pjDHFR. Structural data suggest that binding of PY957 is qualitatively different among pcDHFR, Q35S/N64F, Q35S/ N64S hDHFR, and Q35K hDHFR. Likewise, the kinetic data show differences in Ki values for these three enzyme forms: Q35K hDHFR has the lowest Ki for PY957 (8.3 ( 0.4 nM), followed by pcDHFR (21.9 ( 9.3 nM) and Q35S/N64S hDHFR (66 ( 2 nM), and these values are statistically different from one another. Converting key active site residues at positions 35 and 64 of the human DHFR to amino acids found at these analogous sites in P. jiroVecii or P. carinii DHFR had little effect on kcat. This result is rational, considering that selective pressure during evolution would be presumed to preserve catalytic activity of this important metabolic enzyme; however, the mutations at positions 35 and 64 of the human enzyme do show a small effect on the Km for DHFA. The single and double mutants introducing P. carinii residues into the human enzyme at positions 35 and 64 show a statistically lower Km for substrate DHFA than the native human enzyme; the same tendency is seen for the P. jiroVecii residues, but the effect is not statistically significant. Given that our steady-state conditions for determining Km were with saturating concentrations of NADPH, the enzyme reaction scheme simplifies to E + S 7 8 ES 9 E + P 9 8
k-1 k1 kcat

and thus Km is defined as (k-1 + kcat)/k1. Our determinations of kcat show it to be unchanged in the mutants studied. Therefore, lowered Km values must reflect either a decreased k-1 value or an increased k1 value or both; in either case, the suggestion is that these mutations affect affinity of the

substrate for the active site. Therefore, if we use an array of substrate analogues to probe the active sites of native and mutant forms of DHFR, we would expect to see significant differences in Ki, the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding (k-1/k1). For the competitive inhibitor TMP, our results agree with the above prediction, in that we saw improved affinity for TMP (lower Ki) in all mutants. For the series of mutants converting human to P. jiroVecii-like residues at positions 35 and 64, the changes in Ki values relative to those of native human enzyme were as follows: Q35S, 2.89-fold reduction; N64S, 30.59-fold reduction; Q35SN64S, 4.33-fold reduction. Using the reasoning suggested by Mildvan (14), these values may be converted to log form: Q35S, 100.46; N64S, 101.49; Q35SN64S, 100.64. The effects of the two residues are clearly not additive (i.e., 101.95 * 100.64), suggesting that the residues do not act independently in affecting TMP binding. For mutant proteins converting hDHFR to a more P. cariniilike active site, the log values of changes are as follows: Q35K, 101.12; N64F, 101.03; Q35K/N64F, 100.9. The mutations Q35S and N64S are neither additive nor synergistic, but rather the presence of Q35S seems capable of reversing the effects of N64S; reversal of the effects on Ki is complete or nearly complete for MTX and TMP but only partial for PY957. Similar analysis based on the Ki values for the pseudoirreversible inhibitor MTX and the linear mixed inhibitor PY957 also suggests a degree of antagonism in both sets of mutants; i.e., the effect on the double mutant is less than the effect seen for one or both of the single mutants. These data are consistent with the structural results observed for the single and double mutants bound with PY957. In these structures, variations in the side chain conformation reflect differences in its interactions with the mutants at positions 35 and 64 in the hDHFR ternary complexes with PY957 while maintaining the strong interactions of the inhibitor carboxylate with Arg70. The conformation of the PY957 side chain in the Q35S/N64F double mutant protein complex was unexpected as the side chain of PY957 flips away from Arg70 and instead the methylene carbons of the side chain form hydrophobic interactions with Phe31 and Phe64 (Figure 4). The carboxylate oxygen atoms of PY957 in this orientation make weak interactions with water molecules on the surface of the enzyme. Structural data for the binding of PY957 to the hDHFR variants and to pcDHFR provide insight into the contribution of the active site residues at positions 35 and 64 to the selectivity and specificity of inhibitor binding to h-, pc-, and pjDHFR. These data show that the conformation of the "5-

-carboxyalkyoxyl" side chain of PY957 is flexible and can adopt conformations that optimize its binding interactions with the residues that line the active site. These data suggest that the interactions with side chains of residues at position 64 may contribute more to inhibition than those at position 35 as indicated by the alternative side chain conformation observed in the structure of the Q35S/N64F double mutant of hDHFR. These results imply that the hydrophobic contributions to binding by contacts to Phe31 and Phe64 by the PY957 side chain are greater than those made by the interactions of Ile33 and Phe69 in the pcDHFR ternary complex with PY957 (16). Since Ile33 is smaller than Phe31, it cannot make the same contribution to hydrophobic binding as observed in the Q35S/N64F human complex. Although the PY957 side chain can interact electrostatically with Arg75 in the pcDHFR ternary complex, the side chain conformation changes to enhance its hydrophobic interactions with Phe69 and may result in the twisting of the torsion angle between the two ring systems of PY957 as a consequence of this interaction. The relationships between specificity of PY957 inhibitory potency and active site mutations in hDHFR correlate with the conformational patterns observed in PY957 binding and the enhanced binding observed for those variants that make these active site positions more like those of the Pneumocystis DHFR enzymes. These results taken together suggest that PY957 interacts with the DHFR enzymes from Pneumocystis in ways that are different from TMP such that binding is enhanced (lower Ki) and selectivity is still achieved. This conclusion is supported by the observation that TMP binding follows the pattern of classical competitive inhibition (only Km affected), whereas PY957 best fits a model of linear mixed inhibition (both Km and Vmax affected). These data validate the hypothesis that the increased selectivity of PY957 for pcDHFR is in part due to contributions of the species-specific residues Lys37 and Phe69 of pcDHFR. This insight into the contribution of species-specific residues to inhibitor binding will help in the design of more selective inhibitors that target specific opportunistic fungal pathogens.
