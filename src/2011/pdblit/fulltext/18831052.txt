ABSTRACT The human AU RNA binding protein/ enoyl-Coenzyme A hydratase (AUH) is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaconylCoA dehydratase in the leucine degradation pathway. It also possesses an RNA-binding activity to AUUU repeats, which involves no known conserved RNA-binding domains and is seemingly unrelated to the enzymatic activity. In this study, we performed mass spectrometric analyses to elucidate the oligomeric states of AUH in the presence and absence of RNA. With a short RNA (AUUU) or without RNA, AUH mainly exists as a trimer in solution. On the other hand, the AUH trimer dimerizes upon binding to one molecule of a long RNA containing 24 repeats of the AUUU motif, (AUUU)24A. AUH was crystallized with the long RNA. Although the RNA was disordered in the crystalline lattice, the AUH structure was determined as an asymmetric dimer of trimers with a kink in the alignment of the trimer axes, resulting in the formation of two clefts with significantly different sizes.

INTRODUCTION Protein­RNA interactions play essential roles in various aspects of the posttranscriptional control of gene expression, including splicing, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, localization, stabilization, quality control, mRNA degradation, and translational regulation. Although a number of conserved RNA-binding domains function in these processes (e.g., RNA-recognition motifs, hnRNP K homology domains, zinc finger domains, and tryptophan RNA-binding attenuator protein domains),1­4 many RNA-binding proteins without known RNAbinding domains have also been identified. Interestingly, several of them possess catalytic activities seemingly unrelated to RNA metabolism,5 including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase,6,7 thiolase,8 glutamate dehydrogenase,9 NAD1-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase,10 thymidylate synthase,11 dihydrofolate reductase,12 catalase,13 iron regulatory proteins,14,15 and AU-binding homologue of enoyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase (AUH).16 However, the structural determinants of RNA-binding by these ``RNA-binding enzymes'' have remained almost totally elusive. AUH was first identified as an RNA-binding protein by affinity chromatography.16 It binds to an AU-rich element (ARE), containing clusters of the pentanucleotide AUUUA. AREs are found in the 30 -untranslated regions of certain mRNAs and promote mRNA degradation.17­20 Interestingly, the AUH mRNA, which lacks AREs, becomes up-regulated in the mouse brain upon the administration of mood stabilizers, such as lithium carbonate and valproic acid, two therapeutic agents for bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), which are effective at treating mania.21 These drugs increase the expression levels of the apoptosis factor BCL2 and the transcription factors FOS and JUN-all of which

RNA-induced changes in AUH oligomers

are encoded by ARE-containing mRNAs.21,22 These correlations suggest that AUH may play a role in neuron survival and transcript stability through binding to AREs.21 While AUH shares no significant sequence similarity with other known RNA-binding proteins, it is a member of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily (PROSITE entry PS00166),23 and was recently identified as a 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) in the leucine catabolism pathway,24 and mutations in the AUH gene were identified in two patients suffering from the metabolic disorder 3-methylglutaconic aciduria Type-1, a disease caused by 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency.25,26 AUH also possesses a weak, short-chainspecific enoyl-CoA hydratase activity, consistent with its considerable structural and sequence similar to enoylCoA hydratase (also called crotonase).16,27 Among the members of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/ isomerase superfamily, only AUH has been shown to bind RNA.16 We previously cocrystallized human AUH with the RNA 6-mer AUUUAG, and solved the crystal ° structure at 2.2 A resolution.27 Although the RNA molecule did not appear in the electron density map, the AUH protein structure was well-defined. AUH assumes the typical trimeric a/b spiral fold of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily,28,29 and forms a dimer of the trimers in the asymmetric unit, with three 2-fold and one 3-fold noncrystallographic symmetry axes.27 Positive charges formed by the three lysine residues of a-helix H1 from each subunit, the ``lysine comb,'' line the outer edges of the trimer interface27,30 and were shown to be necessary for the RNA-binding activity of AUH, but not for the catalytic activity for short chain enoyl-CoA.27 As far as we know, no other member of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily possesses an equivalent of the lysine comb, suggesting that the RNA-binding activity of AUH is unique amongst its known structural homologues. A number of structures of other members of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily have been reported.28,31­34 All 10 of the proteins form tight trimers with similar intrasubunit structures. However, the oligomeric state differs among the superfamily members: six of them form dimers of trimers, whereas the others do not. Moreover, three of the dimer-of-trimer members have distinctive folds in the C-terminal domains, which contribute to trimer dimerization. The variability in the trimer dimerization in this superfamily is highlighted by yeast Eci1p, which adopts at least two different trimer dimerization modes.35 In the present study, we analyzed the oligomeric states of AUH, with respect to its RNA interaction, by mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. In the absence of RNA or in the presence of a pentanucleotide

(AUUUA), AUH predominantly exists as trimers. In contrast, when AUH binds to a longer 123-mer RNA containing 24 repeats of AUUU, henceforth abbreviated as (AUUU)24A, the predominant, stable species exhibits a 6:1 stoichiometry (six AUH monomers and one RNA). Furthermore, we crystallized AUH in the absence of RNA and in the presence of (AUUU)24A RNA and determined ° the structures at 2.5- and 2.2-A resolutions, respectively. The RNA-free AUH formed two trimers, which symmetrically interact with each other, in the asymmetric unit, as observed for the previously solved structure of AUH crystallized in the presence of AUUUA. In contrast, AUH cocrystallized with (AUUU)24A RNA formed an ``asymmetric'' dimer of trimers with distinct sizes of the clefts between the two trimers, although no electron density corresponding to the RNA was identified. We describe this asymmetric AUH hexameric structure and discuss its possible RNA-binding mode. METHODS
Sample preparation

The AUH protein was prepared as previously described.27 The (ATTT)24A DNA was cloned into the vector pUC119 (TAKARA) together with the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The 123 mer RNA, containing part of the T7 promoter sequence and (AUUU)24A, GGG AGA CUC UAU AGG GAG ACU GCA GAU UUA UUU AUU UAU UUA UUU AUU UAU UUA UUU AUU UAU UUA UUU AUU UAU UUA UUU AUU UAU UUA UUU AUU UAU UUA UUU AUU UAU UUA UUU AUU UAA, was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA was purified by 7M-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for use in the assays and crystallization.
Gel mobility shift assays

The (AUUU)24A RNA was treated with BAP (Takara) and labeled with 32P, using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo). The AUH protein (0.4­4.0 lM) and the (AUUU)24A RNA (30 nM) were mixed, and 8% PAGE was carried out under non-denaturing conditions with 0.1 3 Tris­Borate­EDTA buffer (8.9 mM Tris base, 8.9 mM boric acid, and 0.25 mM EDTA).
Mass spectrometry

Mass spectrometry was performed under non-denaturing conditions36 on QToF Ultima (Waters, Manchester, UK) and Q-Star XL (MDS Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada) spectrometers, with both instruments modified for the improved transmission of large, noncovalent complexes. Both instruments were fitted with high m/z quadrupoles, while the pressure regime in the early vacuum stages of the instruments was modulated to improve large ion

transmission, either by means of an extra argon line running into the second ion tunnel region of the Waters instrument, or by means of a flow-restricting sleeve surrounding part of the first quadrupole ion guide of the Sciex instrument.37,38 To prepare the protein­RNA mixture for the mass spectrometry analysis, 50 lM AUH trimers and a 20 lM RNA solution, in 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 8.0), were incubated separately at 378C for 5 min. The RNA solution was then added to the protein solution at the indicated protein­RNA ratios, and the solution was mixed by gentle aspiration. The mixture was further incubated at 378C to avoid precipitation. The protein­ RNA mixtures were then diluted with ammonium acetate buffer to typically 5 lM (AUH trimers) and were introduced into the mass spectrometer by nano-electrospray ionization, using gold-coated borosilicate-glass capillaries, produced in-house with a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments) and a Polaron sputter coater (Quorum Technologies, UK). Data were externally cali1 brated against CsnIn21 clusters and were analyzed with Masslynx 4.0 (Waters).

action. The heat generated due to dilution of the titrants was very small and was ignored for the analysis.

Crystallization

Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out using an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with a Beckman An-50 Ti rotor. For sedimentation velocity experiments, cells with a standard Epon two-channel centerpiece and sapphire windows were used. The sample was prepared by mixing AUH and (AUUUA)24A RNA, at concentrations of 0.5­9.0 lM in 10 mM or 150 mM Tris­Cl (pH 7.0), respectively, at room temperature. A 400 lL aliquot of the sample solution and a 420 lL aliquot of the reference buffer (10 mM Tris­Cl, pH 7.0) were loaded into the centrifugation cells. The centrifugation was performed at 208C throughout the analysis. The UV260 (RNA) or UV230 (AUH protein) absorbance was measured at 10 min intervals during sedimentation at 5 3 104 rpm. The scan results were analyzed using the continuous distribution (c(s)) analysis module in the program SEDFIT version 9.339 to calculate the sedimentation coefficient distributions.
Isothermal titration calorimetry

Crystallization of the RNA-free AUH protein was carried out by the vapor diffusion method, with drops of 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 9% PEG8000, 100 mM calcium acetate, 100 mM sodium acetate, and 10 mM imidazole, and with reservoirs of 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 18% PEG8000 and 200 mM calcium acetate, as in the previous study.27 Each drop contained 10 mg/mL AUH protein. In contrast to the good crystals of AUH mixed with AUUUAG RNA reproducibly obtained in the previous study,27 the RNA-free AUH protein produced many small crystals and only one large crystal, which grew to 0.5 3 0.3 3 0.2 mm in a couple of days. Crystallization of the AUH-(AUUU)24A mixture was carried out by the vapor diffusion method, with drops of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.0M ammonium sulfate and 1.0% PEG400, and with reservoirs of 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2.0M ammonium sulfate and 2.0% PEG400. The AUH protein (0.3 mg) and the (AUUU)24A RNA (0.3 mg) were mixed in 10 mM Tris­Cl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM DTT and were concentrated to an AUH concentration of 2.8 mg/mL. Crystals grew up to a maximum size of 0.7 3 0.3 3 0.05 mm in a couple of days.

Structure determination and refinement

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed at 258C with a Microcal (Amherst, MA) VP-ITC calorimeter. Samples were buffered with 150 mM Tris (pH 7.0) and were thoroughly degassed before use. A 2 mL aliquot of AUH was placed in the cell chamber, and 5-lL aliquots of RNA were serially injected into the protein-containing chamber 40 times. The calorimetric data were analyzed with the Microcal ORIGIN software, using a binding model that assumes a single site of inter-

The data set of AUH mixed with the (AUUU)24A RNA was collected from the BL41 XU beam line at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). Diffraction data were recorded with a Mar CCD detector and were processed using the program DENZO/SCALEPACK.40 The initial phase set was determined by using the molecular replacement technique with the program AmoRe, in the program package ° CCP4.45,46 The integration radius was 31 A and the re° solution range was 15­4 A. The AUH trimer structure in the previously reported hexameric structure27 (Protein Data Bank accession number 1HZD) was used as the search model. The water molecules were omitted. The rotation and translation searches for the first trimer gave correlation factors of 17.0 and 33.1, respectively. The translation search for the second solution of the rotation search gave a correlation factor of 55.1, with an R factor of 38.8%. Rigid-body refinement and minimization were carried out using the program CNS,43 and gave R factors of 38.1% and 30.5%, respectively. A good Fourier map was obtained with the phase set calculated from the model. The 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps were used for the electron density analysis. Residues Lys74­Glu339 were visible in the density map, with the exceptions of Lys74 of chain B and Asp142­Ser151 of chain F. The RNA molecule was not visible, in contrast to the protein, although the RNA was confirmed to be present within the crystal (see below). Finally, simulated annealing, water picking, and B factor refinement, using the program CNS43 gave an Rwork of 20.6% (Rfree 24.6%). RESULTS
Oligomeric states and RNA binding of AUH

To determine the oligomeric state of AUH in solution, we performed electrospray mass spectrometry analyses of AUH under non-denaturing conditions. The mass spectrum of RNA-free AUH under low-salt conditions predominantly shows a trimeric form (observed mass 5 89,982 Da; theoretical mass 5 89,943 Da) [Fig. 1(a)]. The hexameric state was only a minor population (data not shown). The dominant trimeric state of AUH in solution, in the absence of RNA, was also detected by analytical ultracentrifugation analyses (see Fig. 2). AUH has been reported to bind to AU-rich element contained in various mRNAs, although it was unclear what RNA length was favored.16 Therefore, to examine the stability of the complexes of AUH with various RNA molecules, we carried out non-denaturing gel mobility shift assays. The AUUUAG RNA, which was used previously for crystallization, showed no sign of a gel mobility shift, although the NMR spectroscopic analysis and the ITC analysis (see below) revealed that this RNA binds to AUH (Fig. S1). This suggests that the complex of AUH

and AUUUAG RNA is dynamic and rapidly dissociates on the time scale of gel electrophoresis. Likewise, the AU-rich element from the IL3 mRNA (AUUUAUUUAUGUAUUUAUGUAUUUAUUUAUUUA; IL3 ARE) also generated no gel mobility shift of AUH under the conditions used, although it was previously shown to bind to AUH by affinity chromatography and in UV cross-linking assays.16,27 With a longer oligonucleotide possessing 12 repeats of AUUU, (AUUU)12A, a faint gel mobility shift of AUH was observed; however, the mixture of (AUUU)12A and AUH was prone to precipitation, making it difficult to obtain reproducible results and the mass spectrum of the complex (data not shown). On the other hand, a 123-mer RNA containing 24 repeats of the AUUU motif, termed (AUUU)24A RNA, yielded bands due to complex formation with AUH in the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. S2). This complex exhibited improved solubility, as compared with the mixtures of the shorter RNA with AUH, under the conditions examined. The bands of the (AUUU)24A AUH complex suggested that it is a compact, stoichiometric complex. The degree of the RNA gel mobility shift was found to depend on the AUH concentration, suggesting that AUH binds to the RNA in a stoichiometry other than 1:1 (Fig. S2). The stoichiometry was then analyzed for the complexes of AUH with the RNA species by mass spectrometry. First, we examined AUH with a short RNA, AUUUA, which is one base shorter than the AUUUAG molecule used for the previous crystallographic study.27 Figure 1(b) shows that, in the presence of AUUUA RNA, the major species observed are AUH trimers with one, two, or three RNA molecules bound, consistent with one RNA-binding site per AUH subunit. Next, we examined the AUH­(AUUUA)24A­RNA complex. When an excess of AUH over RNA was present (AUH:RNA 5 7.5:1), the observed complex had an AUH:RNA stoichiometry of 6:1 (observed molecular mass of 221,359 Da and theoretical mass 218,853 Da) [Fig. 1(c)]. The 3:1 complex was not detected under this condition. Consistent result was obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation (see Fig. 2). Therefore, we conclude that the binding of (AUUUA)24A RNA to AUH alters the trimer­trimer association behavior of AUH. With an excess of RNA over the AUH trimer (2-fold excess), in addition to the 6:1 complex and the free RNA molecule (observed mass 41,487 Da and calculated mass 38,967 Da), we detected the 3:1 complex (observed mass 131,301 Da and calculated mass 128,910 Da), although its solubility was markedly reduced [Fig. 1(d)]. The 3:1 complex was unstable and precipitated over time, which left only the 6:1 complex in solution. However, no complex containing more than one RNA molecule was detected [Fig. 1(d)]. Consistent with the mass spectrometric analysis, the ITC analysis showed that AUH binds to the (AUUU)24A RNA at a molar ratio of 6:1 and with a dissociation

Overlapping charge series are observed for AUH3:RNA1, AUH3:RNA2 and AUH3:RNA3 (Observed masses 5 91,556 Æ 24 Da, 93,045 Æ 17 Da and 94,572 Æ 12 Da, respectively, expected 5 91,458 Da, 92,973 Da, and 94,488 Da.). No oligomers containing more than one AUH trimer were observed. (c) nESI mass spectrum of AUH incubated with (AUUU)24A RNA (AUH monomer:RNA 5 7.5:1). Inset: the observed complex at low collisional activation. Significant peak broadening occurred due to the retention of buffer components, making the charge state assignment difficult. Main panel: mass spectrum of the same sample acquired with increased collisional activation in the instrument's collision cell. The activation assists in the removal of excess buffer, yielding sharper peaks, and allows the confident assignment of charge states. The major species (centered around the 132 ion at 6,924 m/z) is AUH6:RNA1 (observed mass 5 221,359 Æ 59 Da, theoretical mass 5 218,853 Da). These conditions also lead to gas-phase dissociation of the complex, yielding high-charge AUH monomers (121 at 1,432 m/z, observed mass 5 30,025 Æ 2 Da, expected 5 29,981 Da) and the ``stripped'' complex AUH5:RNA1 (111 ion at 17,422 m/z, observed mass 5 191,314 Æ 15 Da, calculated 5 188,872 Da), and thus giving extra confidence to the assigned stoichiometry. (d) nESI mass spectrum of AUH incubated with (AUUU)24A RNA (AUH monomer:RNA 5 3:2). Main panel: charge series corresponding to RNA (111 at 3,779 m/z, observed mass 5 41,487 Æ 15 Da, expected 5 38,967 Da; a Dm of 2,520 is equivalent to 110 Mg ions, 114 Na ions or 140 water molecules bound to the RNA, or approximately 1 adduct per phosphate group), AUH3:RNA1 (124 ion at 5,474 m/z, observed mass 5 131,301 Æ 41 Da, expected 5 128,910 Da), and AUH6:RNA1 (134 at 6,525 m/z, observed mass 5 221,631 Æ 44 Da, expected 5 218,853 Da). Inset: the same sample analyzed after 4 further hours of incubation at 378C--the signal for the AUH3:RNA1 complex has decreased significantly, as compared with that of the more stable AUH6:RNA1 complex. The mass spectrometry data were obtained using the Q-TOF Ultima instrument for (a) and (b), and the Q-Star XL instrument for (c) and (d)--see Materials and Methods section.

Three AUH subunits form a disc-shaped trimer with a noncrystallographic 3fold symmetry axis [Fig. 3(c)], which is consistent with the mass spectrometric result that AUH exists as a trimer in solution. Furthermore, two of these AUH trimers associate with each other in the crystalline lattice. The hexameric structure has three 2-fold and one 3-fold noncrystallographic symmetry axes, and thus appears as a ``symmetric'' dimer of trimers [Fig. 3(c)]. The trimeric and hexameric arrangements of AUH in the RNA-free state are also quite similar to those previously reported for AUH crystallized in the presence of the AUUUAG RNA (RMSD 0.20).27

constant of 60 nM (AUH hexamer vs. RNA monomer) (Fig. S3). In contrast, the AUUUA RNA exhibited much weaker binding to AUH than the (AUUU)24A RNA (Fig. S3) (Kd 5 $1 mM), showing that AUH preferentially binds to the longer RNA sequence.
Structure of RNA-free AUH

To further understand the subunit assembly manners, we solved the structures of the RNA-free AUH and the AUH bound to the (AUUU)24A RNA. The RNA-free AUH provided only one good crystal, belonging to the ° space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a 5 79.2 A, ° , c 5 80.0 A, and b 5 108.18, which are ° b 5 132.4 A close to those of the previously reported crystal structure of AUH mixed with the AUUUAG RNA.27 The crystal ° structure was refined at 2.5 A resolution. The asymmetric unit contains six AUH subunits and 309 water molecules. The residues from Glu74 to Glu339 in chains A, C, and E, and those from Glu75 to Glu339 in chains B, D, and F were visible and well determined [Fig. 3(a)]. The crystallographic and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The fold of each subunit is very similar to that observed in the previously determined structure of AUH cocrystallized with AUUUAG RNA (RMSD 0.19), in which the RNA molecule was disordered [Fig. 3(b)]. The AUH subunit secondary structure consists of 10 a-helices (H1-H10), four 310-helices (H0A, H0B, H4A, and H7A), and 10 b-strands (A0-A5 and B2-B5), as described in the previous study.27 The AUH fold is typical of the enoylCoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily,28,29 and is divided into four domains: the N-terminal spiral domain (a-helices H1-H3, 310-helices H0A-H4A, and b-strands A0-B4),

AUH cocrystallized with (AUUU)24A RNA yielded good crystals, with a maximum size of 0.7 3 0.3 3 0.05 mm. The crystallographic and refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. The crystals belong to the space ° group P21, with unit cell dimensions of a 5 83.7 A, b 5 ° , c 5 88.6 A, and b 5 94.38. The crystal structure ° 129.3 A was solved by the molecular replacement technique and ° was refined at 2.2 A resolution. The asymmetric unit contains six AUH subunits and 508 water molecules. Almost all of the AUH residues are visible [Fig. 4(a)], with the exception of the H2A helix and its following loop (142­151 residues) in chain F [Fig. 4(b)]. Intriguingly, however, the RNA molecule was not visible in the electron density map, despite the Fo-Fc difference Fourier map exploration, which is similar to the previous observations with the AUUUAG RNA. To confirm the presence of the RNA within the crystals, we analyzed the crystals by 7M urea denaturing PAGE. The crystals were washed with fresh reservoir solution three times, and then were dissolved in water. The solution from the crystals and the reservoir used for the final wash were subjected to gel electrophoresis side by side, and the gel was stained with toluidine blue after electrophoresis [Fig. 4(c)]. The analysis revealed that the RNA was present in the crystals and was not eluted into the wash solution, suggesting that the RNA molecule is disordered within the crystalline lattice. To identify the RNA molecules in the crystalline lattice, we tried to crystallize AUH with the (AUUU)24A RNA uniformly labeled with 5-iodo-uridine. However, this combination of the protein and the labeled RNA did not produce good crystals (data not shown), presumably because the (AUUU)24A RNA contains many uridine residues, and the uniform iodine incorporation may have drastically changed the molecular properties of the complex. AUH with the (AUUU)24A RNA has a subunit structure and trimeric arrangement almost identical to those

H9 a-helices at the trimer­trimer interface, upon imposing the 138 trimer axis tilt (see below). Another difference in the asymmetric form is the disorder in the a-helix H2A of chain F and the following loop (142­151 residues), which are located on the outer edge of the wider cleft and are exposed to the solvent [Fig. 4(b)], whereas the counterpart region in chain A of the partner trimer is visible, but with high B-factors ° (higher than 80 A2). Therefore, the distal parts of the wider cleft are quite flexible in the asymmetric form, in contrast to the ordered structures in the symmetric form. Because of these structural features, the asymmetric form lacks the noncrystallographic 2- and 3-fold symmetric axes, which are present in the symmetric form.

of the symmetric dimer of trimers [Fig. 4(b)]. However, the relationship between the two trimers within the hexamer is strikingly different: AUH forms an asymmetric dimer of trimers when crystallized with the (AUUUA)24A RNA. The 3-fold axes of the two trimers do not coincide, since they are tilted [Fig. 5(a)]. Therefore, between the ° trimers, the hexamer has a very large cleft (about 9­20 A height) on one side and a relatively small cleft (about 6 ° A height) on the opposite side [Fig. 5(b)], which henceforth we refer to as the ``wider'' and ``narrower'' clefts, respectively [Fig. 5(a,b)]. The wider and narrower clefts correspond to two and one, respectively, of the three clefts in the symmetric dimer of trimers [Fig. 5(b)].
Differences in the manner of trimer dimerization between the AUH symmetric and asymmetric forms

As shown in Figure 5(b), the residues involved in the trimer­trimer interactions of the AUH asymmetric form are clustered in two regions, which form the border between the wider and narrower clefts. These interactions are mainly provided by the two pairs of H9 a-helices in the T2 domains, which are located side by side on the trimer­trimer interfaces: the H9 a-helices of chains B and C interact with those of chains F and E, respectively [Fig. 4(b)]. The asymmetry of the trimer assembly is highlighted by the different contributions from the H9 helices: the C-terminal part of the H9 a-helix in one

Figure 5 shows the major differences in the trimer­ trimer association behavior within the symmetric and asymmetric forms. First, the relative rotational angle between the two trimers around one of the trimer 3-fold axes of the asymmetric form is about 608 [Fig. 5(a), right upper panel], whereas that of the symmetric form is about 308 [Fig. 5(a), left upper panel]. Second, the 3-fold axes of the trimers tilt by 138 in the asymmetric form [Fig. 5(a), right lower panel], whereas they coincide in the symmetric form [Fig. 5(a), left lower panel]. The rotation of the trimer around the 3-fold axis is necessary to circumvent the steric hindrance between the opposing

trimer protrudes toward the wider cleft and is not involved in the trimer­trimer interactions, and therefore, the H2B a-helices in another trimer are involved in the trimer dimerization (Fig. S4). These interactions are predominantly van der Waals interactions, where relatively small amino acid residues (Ala, Glu, Ile, Pro, Ser, Thr, ° and Val) are involved in direct contacts (cutoff 4 A) (Fig. S4). In contrast, the symmetric form exhibits a trimer­ trimer interaction that is clearly different from that of the asymmetric form, as shown in Figure 5(d). In this case, the H9 helices from each trimer contribute equally to the interactions. As compared with other proteins belonging to the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily, including both the trimer and dimer-of-trimer members,28,31­34 AUH has a shorter H2B a-helix, which does not protrude from the disc-shaped trimer. In contrast, the H2B helices of enoyl-CoA hydratase (PDB ID:1DUB) and dienoylCoA isomerase (PDB ID:1DCI) occupy the region of the intertrimer clefts in AUH. These may be the reasons why the trimer­trimer interaction of AUH is weak, and why the dimer of trimers is merely a minor component of the RNA-free AUH in solution. On the other hand, the shortened H2B helix avoids steric hindrances against the partner trimer when the trimer tilts and rotates [Fig. 5(a)]. The trimer­trimer interaction is even less extensive in the asymmetric form than in the symmetric form, since the ° direct atomic contacts (cutoff 4 A) between the two trimers in the asymmetric form (36 contacts) are less than one third of those in the symmetric form (121 contacts) [Fig. 5(b)]. This strongly suggests that the trimer­trimer association of the asymmetric hexamer might be dependent on the RNA to maintain its stability.

DISCUSSION
Possible RNA-binding and subunit assembly modes of AUH

In this study, we have shown that the oligomeric state of AUH is dependent on the presence of its RNA binding partner. The mass spectra and analytical ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that AUH exists predominantly as trimers in the absence of RNA. The binding of the pentanucleotide AUUUA did not induce trimer dimerization under these conditions. Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the symmetric hexameric state observed in the crystals27 exists as a minor population in solution. Interestingly, we obtained only one good crystal of the RNA-free AUH protein, but the AUHAUUUAG RNA mixture reproducibly provided good crystals.27 The phosphate group of the AUUUAG RNA and/or the higher ionic strength of the crystallization conditions (i.e., 100 mM calcium acetate, 100 mM sodium acetate), as compared with the low-salt conditions of mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation, may shield the

repulsive electrostatic interactions between the positively charged lysine combs across the symmetric trimer­trimer interface. Therefore, the short AUUUAG RNA was very effective in crystallizing AUH in the symmetric hexameric form, although the RNA was not visible in the electron density. In this context, the MS data of AUH in the absence of RNA exhibited a weak signal for hexamers in addition to the predominant signal for trimers (data not shown), whereas the minor peaks could have arisen from nonspecific aggregation of two trimers during the nESI process.51 In the case of AUH, the hexamer signal is enhanced at very high salt concentrations (>1M ammonium acetate, data not shown). Both the mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation data revealed that the (AUUU)24A RNA induces dimerization of the AUH trimer. In this context, the ARE length of the (AUUU)24A RNA is similar to those of the AREs of the JUN, FOS, and BCL2 mRNAs (152, 70, and 105 bases, respectively).52,53 The AUH trimer dimer forms a new asymmetric form, which lacks the 3- and 2fold crystallographic rotation axes, because of realignment of the internal 3-fold axes of the trimers [Fig. 5(a)]. When an excess of RNA over AUH is used, it is possible to create a population containing one RNA molecule and one AUH trimer, but this complex seems to be unstable and prone to precipitation. As the (AUUU)24A RNA is disordered in the crystalline lattice, the RNA seems to be disordered on the AUH. However, the gel mobility shift and ITC analyses indicated reasonable affinity between AUH and the RNA ($60 nM). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the RNA is also able to bind to the symmetric dimer, the asymmetric dimer should be more feasible as the RNA-bound form of AUH: (1) the crystal contact in the asymmetric hexamer was not significantly greater than that in the symmetric dimmer, and (2) the trimer­trimer interactions in the asymmetric form are much less extensive than those in the symmetric form, suggesting that interactions between the protein and the disordered RNA must also contribute to the ``trimer­trimer'' binding interface, hence stabilizing the trimer dimerization. These observations lead us to suggest a model of RNA binding-induced dimerization of the AUH trimer: in the absence of RNA, the favorable interactions within the trimer­trimer interface are insufficient to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the lysine combs. RNA binding is probably mediated at first by electrostatic interactions between the lysine combs and the phosphate backbone, and then by RNA base-specific interactions elsewhere with the protein. This generates an extended trimer­trimer interface area and shields the electrostatic repulsion between the lysine combs, thus permitting the association of two AUH trimers on the RNA template. The asymmetric form has two clefts with distinct sizes (the wider and narrower clefts), in which the edges are highly positively charged, because of the residues in the

a-helices H1 and H10 and the loops H1-A2 [Fig. 5(c)]. The H1 helix contains the lysine comb, which was previously identified as being necessary for RNA binding by AUH.27 This suggests that the clefts are strong candidates for the RNA-binding sites of the asymmetric form. The interior faces of the clefts are occupied by noncharged residues with potential hydrogen bonding partners. The narrower cleft places the H1 a-helix from one trimer in very close proximity to the H1-A2 loop from the other trimer, making the region of the narrower cleft highly positively charged [Fig. 5(c)]. The wider cleft provides a vast volume, which is potentially large enough to accommodate the RNA bases [Fig. 5(c)]. Previously, it was shown that AUH does not bind to the mutant ARE of adenovirus IVa2, in which the AUUUA sequences are replaced with AGGUA.16 It remains unclear how AUH distinguishes between different RNA sequences. One possible mode might be for the bases to occupy the clefts, forming interactions that mediate sequence specificity, with the backbone exposed to the solvent and electrostatically interacting with the lysine comb. To address this issue, it is essential to solve the AUH-RNA complex structure in a manner that allows visualization of the RNA in the crystalline lattice. To do this, it would be important to site-specifically label the RNA with heavy atoms, such as iodine and bromine, and/or to immobilize the RNA on the protein by chemical or UV crosslinking.

AUH is a 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, an enzyme in the leucine degradation pathway,25 and it also has weak, short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase activity.16 The hydratase active-site pocket of AUH was previously identified as being formed by the H2A-H3 a-helices and the H4A 310 helix of one subunit, and the H8 and H9 ahelices of the adjacent subunit within the same trimer27 [Fig. S5(a)]. No significant differences are apparent between the active-site pocket structures in the symmetric and asymmetric forms. Figure S4(b) shows a close-up view of the AUH active-site pocket, superimposed with the substrate analogue acetoacetyl-CoA, from the enoylCoA hydratase structure (PDB ID:1DUB29). The structures of AUH revealed two basic amino acids, Arg146 and Arg162, located close to the active site pocket, in sequence positions occupied by hydrophobic residues in enoyl-CoA hydratase (Met103 and Leu117, respectively, in rat enoyl-CoA hydratase). When compared with acetoacetyl-CoA, the substrate 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA has an additional carboxylate group that must be accommodated in the binding site [Fig. S5(c)]; either or both of the nearby arginine side chains may play a role in stabilizing this negative charge in the enzyme­ substrate complex. In a variant form of human AUH that causes 3-methylglutaconic aciduria Type-1, Ala240 is replaced by
