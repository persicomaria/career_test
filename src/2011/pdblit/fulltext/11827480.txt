O-Glycosylation is emerging as a common posttranslational modification of surface exposed proteins in bacterial mucosal pathogens. In pathogenic Neisseria an O-glycosylation pathway modifies a single abundant protein, pilin, the subunit protein that forms pili. Here, we identify an additional outer membrane glycoprotein in pathogenic Neisseria, the nitrite reductase AniA, that is glycosylated in its C-terminal repeat region by the pilin glycosylation pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a general O-glycosylation pathway in a prokaryote. We also show that AniA displays polymorphisms in residues that map to the surface of the protein. A frame-shift mutation abolishes AniA expression in 34% of Neisseria meningitidis strains surveyed, however, all Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains examined are predicted to express AniA, implying a crucial role for AniA in gonococcal biology.

There are now many reports of glycosylation of proteins in bacteria, particularly in bacterial pathogens. In most of these reports a specific glycoprotein has been identified using structural, immunological or genetic approaches, and in some cases key genes involved in the glycosylation process have been identified (reviewed in [1,2]). Recently there have been key advances in understanding the physiology and molecular mechanisms of glycosylation in the two best characterised bacterial systems; N-glycosylation in Campylobacterjejuni [3­5] and O-glycosylation in pathogenic Neisseria. Pilin of pathogenic Neisseria was one of the first examples of an O-glycosylated glycoprotein in a bacterial pathogen [6]. A series of studies have identified the genes encoding glycosyltransferases required for the biosynthesis of the pilin glycan [7­9]; and of alternate structures than can be synthesised in different strains [1,10,11] (Fig. 1A). Recent studies in Neisseria meningitidis have proposed that the addition of O-linked glycan to pilin is performed by an O-oligosaccharyltransferase, PglL, which is homologous to O-antigen ligases that catalyse addition of O-antigen to lipopolysaccahride [12]. This is supported by subsequent work in Neisseria gonorrhoeae [13], and by the transfer of the N. meningitidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pilin O-glycosylation systems into Escherichia coli [14]. In this report we demonstrate that the pilin O-glyco-

sylation system in pathogenic Neisseria is a general pathway for protein O-glycosylation. Materials and methods Bacterial strains and culture conditions. Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains are listed in are Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 see [15]), and were grown on brain heart infusion medium (BHI) supplemented with Levinthal's base (and IsoVitaleX For N. gonorrhoeae).

concentration of 1 mM. Nitrite utilisation was assayed colorimetrically with the Griess reagent [20] essentially as described [21]. Nucleotide sequence analysis of aniA from clinical isolates. The aniA gene was amplified and sequenced using primers aniA_upstm and aniA_downstm or primers aniA_F and aniA_R (Table 1). Multiple sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW (http:// www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html), and a phylogenetic tree built with WorkBench (http://workbench.sdsc.edu/). Construction of porA, frpB and aniA mutant strain in C311. The plasmid pIP52 (Dr. Ian Peak, unpublished) was used to inactivate porA in strain C311. The frpB gene was amplified using frpB14R and frpB11F, cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega), generating pGEM-frpB. The aniA gene in two fragments, using primers aniA_F and aniA50 XhoI_R and primers aniA_R and aniA50 XhoI_F, introducing a XhoI restriction site and cloned into pGEM-T Easy, generating pGEM-aniA(XhoI). pGEM-aniA(XhoI) and pGEM-frpB were digested with XhoI and ligated together with the isolated SalI digested fragment from pUC4Kan (Amersham Biosciences) containing the kanaymcin cassette. The porA, frpB and aniA mutant constructs were linearised and transformed into N. meningitidis strain C311 and N. gonorrhoeae strain 1291 as described previously [22]. The pUC4kan kanamycin cassette has no promoter or terminator that is active in Neisseria and does not affect tran-

scription nor have a polar effect on expression of adjacent genes [22,23]. Construction and purification of FLAG-tagged AniA from N. meningitidis strain C311. Sequence encoding a FLAG-tag (N-AspTyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-C) was fused to the C-terminus of aniA of C311. Vector pT7blueaniA::flagtetMB was constructed by overlap PCR using the primers aniA_F, NMB1624_R, 30 flag_XhoI_ds and NMB1624_F_XhoI. The 30 flag_XhoI_ds primer encoded a FLAG-tag extension followed by a stop codon to allow incorporation of the tag in frame with aniA. The aniA::flag construct with NMB1624 (downstream of aniA) was initially cloned into pT7blue (Novagen) to create pT7blueaniA::flag. A tetracycline antibiotic resistant cassette (TetMB) was digested with SalI and cloned into XhoI linearised pT7blueaniA::flag to create pT7blueaniA::flag tetMB, which was transformed to the chromosome of C311 by homologous recombination as described above. Cells expressing AniA-FLAG were grown on BHI agar containing 1 lg/mL tetracycline and 1 mM of sodium nitrite at 37 °C for 24 h. AniA-FLAG protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mass spectrometry. Protein was reduced/alkylated with dithiothreitol/iodoacetamide. AniA-FLAG was precipitated by addition of 4 volumes of 1:1 acetone:methanol, incubation at ­20 °C

for 16 h, and centrifugation at 18,000 rcf for 10 min. Protein was dried, resuspended in 50 lL 50 mM NH4HCO3 with 1 lg trypsin (proteomics grade, Sigma), and digested at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides and glycopeptides were analysed by LC­ESI­MS/MS with an API QSTAR Pulsar i LC/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems). Samples were separated on a ZORBAX SB-C18 5 lm, 150 Â 0.5 mm column equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water, and eluted using a gradient to 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid over 45 min. For AniA-FLAG, Analyst QS 1.1 software was used to manually examine LC­MS and MS/MS data for the presence of predicted peptides and glycopeptides. Results and discussion AniA is an O-glycoprotein Analysis of outer membrane fractions from N. meningitidis by western blot with anti-trisaccharide sera [1] revealed a $68 kDa band in strain C311 that was not present in the mutant strains such as C311pglA that are unable to synthesize the trisaccharide (Fig. 1B). As the pilin glycoprotein migrates at 17 kDa, this additional $68 kDa band was a putative novel glycoprotein. The $68 kDa band was still present in a C311pilE mutant strain in which the gene that encodes the pilin protein, pilE, has been inactivated, confirming that the glycoprotein was not caused by aberrantly migrating pilin (Fig. 1B). To identify the novel glycoprotein, anti-trisaccharide sera reactivity was followed through ion exchange chromatography and gel electrophoresis to enrich for the immunoreactive band. Proteins present in this enriched fraction were digested with trypsin and identified with mass spectrometry. Three candidate glycoproteins were thereby identified: PorA, the major outer membrane porin of N. meningitidis [24], FrpB, an outer membrane protein involved in iron uptake [25], and AniA an outer membrane protein with nitrite reductase activity [26­29] (Supplementary Table 3). Mutations were made in each candidate gene and these mutant alleles were transferred to the chromosome using established methods [8]. The additional anti-trisaccharide serareactive protein was still present in the C311porA and C311frpB mutant strains (Fig. 1C and D, respectively), but was lost in the C311aniA mutant, suggesting that AniA was the additional glycoprotein (Fig. 1E). Using anti-AniA mAb [16] it was confirmed that the C311aniA mutant did not express AniA (Fig. 1F). Western blot analysis using anti-trisaccharide sera in a series of strains deficient in various steps in the pilin glycosylation pathway (pglE, pglA and pglB: see Fig. 1A) showed that AniA is glycosylated by the same pathway as pilin (Fig. 1G). Increased migration of AniA was seen in western blot analysis of N. gonorrhoeae wild-type (disaccharide, strain 1291) and mutant strains (monosaccharide, 1291pglA; and no glycan 1291pglD) (Fig. 1H and I). This indicates that AniA may also be a glycoprotein in N. gonorrhoeae. AniA, a major anaerobically induced protein in Neisseria, is a nitrite reductase [27,29]. We tested if the O-linked trisaccharide was required for AniA nitrite reductase activity (conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide) in an in vitro nitrite utilisation assay. This analysis showed that the glycan was not required for AniA function (Fig. 4C). AniA is glycosylated in the carboxy-terminal region AniA purified from C311pglA was digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were analysed by LC­ESI­MS/MS. Ions corresponding to peptides from throughout the AniA protein sequence were detected (Supplementary Table 4). C311pglA lacks the PglA

surface exposed serines and threonines, and hence potential substrates of the PglL O-oligosaccharyltransferase. Ions corresponding to singly and doubly glycan-modified peptide were detected for the peptide L358SDTAYAGNGAAPAAS APAASAPAASASEK387, as well as unmodified peptide. MS/MS of these ions confirmed the expected peptide identity (Fig. 2B), and for the glycopeptides also confirmed the presence of DATDH modification (Fig. 2C and D). However, it was not possible to assign the modified serines or threonines within this sequence, due to the lability of the DATDH-Ser/Thr glycosidic bond. Nonetheless, the presence of these glycopeptides proves that AniA has covalently linked glycans. The sequence of the glycosylated regions of PilE and AniA are not homologous. In PilE, the glycosylated S63 is located in a surface exposed but structured region of the protein in the sequence N60NTS63AGVA67. In AniA, the glycosylated C-terminal region (L358SDTAYAGNGAAPAASAPAASAPAASASEK387) is outside the core nitrite reductase domain, and is not predicted to form secondary structural elements. Interestingly, a mutant strain not expressing the pilin glycoprotein shows additional glycosylation of AniA, resulting in an increase in apparent MW and reactivity to trisaccharide antisera (see Fig. 1B). This additional glycosylation could be due to increased occupancy of partially used glycosylation sites in the C-terminal peptide, or modification of further sites. The fact that AniA is glycosylated at all in a PilE expressing strain is clear evidence that it is a bona fide glycoprotein, and not an accidental substrate that is modified only when PilE is not being expressed. The additional glycosylation observed in the pilE mutant background also provides further evidence that these proteins are competing substrates for the same glycosylation pathway. The precise nature of the acceptor substrate specificity of the key component of this system, the PglL O-oligosaccharyltransferase [12], and other factors that influence competition between alternative substrates remains to be elucidated. AniA is surface exposed and may be subject to immune selection We identified the AniA glycoprotein in an outer membrane protein fraction (Supplementary Table 3). Whole cell ELISA

(Fig. 3A) and colony immunoblotting (Fig. 3B) demonstrated that AniA is surface exposed, consistent with previous studies [26­28]), and is potentially subject to immune selection [30]. Sequence analysis revealed that 34% of clinical isolates surveyed contained a frame-shift mutation that results in premature termination of the protein. Typical examples are shown in Fig. 4A. Western blot analysis of two of the N. meningitidis strains containing the frame-shift mutation, 1000 and NGP20, revealed that neither express AniA (Fig. 4B) or reduce nitrite (Fig. 4C) suggesting that strains with the frame-shift mutation allele lack AniA expression. We measured the AniA phase variation rate to be less than 1:400,000 (data not shown). Together, this indicates that AniA expression has been lost in a significant minority of N. meningitidis isolates. Multi locus sequence typing has been used to define the N. meningitidis population structure, which is comprised of distinct sequence types (STs) and clonal complexes [31]. The observed silencing frame-shift mutation (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2; Fig. 4A) is present in a wide variety of clonal complexes (Fig. 4D), suggesting that N. meningitidis strains that do not express AniA are widespread, and that there may be selection against expression of AniA in N. meningitides. Clearly, AniA is not essential for colonisation or disease in this organism. During the preparation for the manuscript, Stefanelli et al. [32] also noted the same inactivating mutation in AniA (see Fig. 4A) in a survey of a large collection of N. meningitidis clinical isolates. In contrast, all of the 20 N. gonorrhoeae strains surveyed here have the wild-type allele, suggesting that AniA has a key role in N. gonorrhoeae biology. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 41 N. meningitidis strains revealed a number of sequence polymorphisms between strains (Fig. 4E and F; Supplementary Fig. 2). Examination of the position of these differences based on the structure of N. gonorrheae AniA [33] (red; Fig. 4G­I), showed that they are all surface exposed in the AniA trimer. Furthermore, theoretical translations of AniA from strains containing the frame-shifted allele revealed additional variant residues also on the surface of the protein (orange; Fig. 4G­I). The glycosylated C-terminal region is not included in the reported N. gonorrhoeae AniA crystal structure [33]. This glycosylated region would leave the core protein fold from a shallow cleft between AniA monomers (cyan C-123 in Fig. 4G­I). This surface region lacked variable residues, and may bind the protein substrate of AniA [33]. The glycosylated C-terminal extension could shield this surface, protecting it from immune exposure. In most other bacteria AniA is located in the periplasmic space and thus is not subject to immune selection. In the pathogenic Neisseria this protein appears to be surface exposed. Taken together the data presented here suggested that the protein may be under immune selective pressure. The silencing of the gene in many of N. meningitidis strains is consistent with immune selection against its expression, as are the amino acid sequence polymorphisms observed in key, surface exposed regions of the AniA protein. The precise role that the glycosylation of pilin plays in the biology of pathogenic Neisseria has not been determined. However, pilin is under intense immune selection and is the archetypal example for antigenic variation. The addition of a phase variable glycan to this protein may serve as an additional immune evasion strategy. Therefore, the decoration of the surface exposed, flexible, C-terminal domain of AniA with the same phase variable O-linked glycan modification may also be an immune evasion strategy. Immune selection acting on the surface proteins of this host-adapted pathogen may have been the driving force for the evolution of this general O-glycosylation pathway.
