ABSTRACT The structure of a novel plant defensin isolated from the seeds of the mung bean, Vigna radiate, has been determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The three-dimensional structure of VrD2, the V. radiate plant defensin 2 protein, comprises an a-helix and one triplestranded anti-parallel b-sheet stabilized by four disulfide bonds. This protein exhibits neither insecticidal activity nor a-amylase inhibitory activity in spite of showing a similar global fold to that of VrD1, an insecticidal plant defensin that has been suggested to function by inhibiting insect a-amylase. Our previous study proposed that loop L3 of plant defensins is important for this inhibition. Structural analyses and surface charge comparisons of VrD1 and VrD2 revealed that the charged residues of L3 correlate with the observed difference in inhibitory activities of these proteins. A VrD2 chimera that was produced by transferring the proposed functional loop of VrD1 onto the structurally equivalent loop of VrD2 supported this hypothesis. The VrD2 chimera, which differs by only five residues compared with VrD2, showed obvious activity against Tenebrio molitor a-amylase. These results clarify the mode of a-amylase inhibition of plant defensins and also represent a possible approach for engineering novel a-amylase inhibitors. Plant defensins are important constituents of the innate immune system of plants, and thus the application of protein engineering to this protein family may provide an efficient method for protecting against crop losses.

tumoricidal, and chemotactic activity.2 Recently, several structural and functional studies demonstrated that defensins exhibit cell lytic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, parasites, and tumor cells via membrane permeabilization.3­7 Most defensins can directly interact with cell membrane, insert into membranes, and form pores to disrupt cellular functions. Hence, determination of solution structures of defensins will be useful for understanding the folding of the protein in the membrane interface. The details of biological functions and activities of defensin are particularly summarized in a recent review article on human b-defensin-3.2 In this study, we will focus on the solution structure and protein engineering of plant defensin. Plant defensins are a family of highly basic proteins of 45­54 amino acids. They are widely distributed in the plant kingdom among such plants as wheat, barley, pea, radish, sorghum, and mung bean.8­13 Various plant defensins are able to inhibit digestive enzymes10,14­17 and protein synthesis in cellfree system9,13,18,19 or to act against bacteria and fungi.20­22 Among these, the antimicrobial functions of plant defensins have been extensively studied. As well as general properties of defensins, the microbial toxicity of plant defensins has been suggested to occur through their interactions with negatively charged membrane phospholipids,21 ion channels,23,24 or glucosylceramides.25 Along with several mutagenesis studies that have been performed to investigate the relation between structure and anti-fungal activities,24,26 these results have potentiated the development of novel antibiotics.27 Several threedimensional (3D) structures of plant defensins from various sources have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.17,28­34 The global structure of plant defensins involves cross-linking via four disulfide bonds (except for PhD1, which contains five

INTRODUCTION Defensins, a group of small cationic antimicrobial peptides, are widely distributed in plants to animals.1 It is commonly believed that they are the first line of innate immunity. Invading pathogenic microbes can be recognized and destroyed by defensins directly, hence they exhibit multiple and diverse functions such as bactericidal,

disulfide bonds33) and comprises a triple-stranded antiparallel b-sheet with an a-helix in parallel. A systematic study also demonstrated that the key role of disulfide bonds in stability of the structure as well as on the survival of the peptide from proteolytic degradation.35,36 The major characteristic of plant defensin structures is the cysteine-stabilized ab (CSab) motif, which has also been observed in the structures of insect defensins,37 scorpion toxins,38 and the sweet protein brazzein.39 The broad distribution of this motif in functionally diverse proteins suggests that it has been naturally selected for its high sequence permissiveness and functional versatility.40 Interestingly, this motif has also been presented to be a suitable template for engineering.41,42 The studies performed with scorpion charybdotoxin have shown that this motif retains its global fold even with insertions, deletions, and substitutions throughout its structure. Plant defensins were recently reported to exhibit in vitro insect-resistant activity against bruchids.43,44 The Vigna radiate defensin 1 (VrD1) from mung bean has been used as a method of conferring insect resistance to agronomically important crops.13 a-Amylase inhibitors have previously been shown to provide protection against pests. Expression of the common bean a-amylase inhibitor 1 (aAI) in transgenic pea imparts complete resistance against bruchids.45 The a-amylase inhibitory activity observed in VrD1 may prevent the growth of bruchid larvae that infest mung bean seeds.17 Another plant defensin, VrD2, was isolated using a similar purification procedure and characterized as an antifungal protein (M.-P. Hsu and C.-S. Chen, unpublished results). Interestingly, VrD2 and VrD1 differ with regard to insecticidal and aamylase activities. As these proteins show a low degree of sequence identity, we compared their 3D structures as a means of understanding the biochemical basis for their different activities. Although several structures of a-amylase-inhibitor complexes have been determined and analyzed to elucidate the framework of the enzyme­inhibitor interaction,46­49 determining a common mechanism for aamylase inhibition has been hindered by their different interacting networks. Hence, more structural information is required to determine the mode of inhibition of plant defensins. In the current report, we study the relation between structure and insect a-amylase specificity of plant defensins by protein engineering. We have determined the 3D structure of VrD2 by 1H NMR spectroscopy. A VrD2 chimera (VrD2c) that acquired the same anti-a-amylase activity as VrD1 was designed based on a structural comparison of the two proteins. Homology modeling of VrD2c and computational docking with an enzyme target were used to understand the interaction between VrD2c and Tenebrio molitor a-amylase (TMA). The biological function observed with VrD2c suggests that plant defensins are a suitable target family for protein engineering. Our data verify the previously proposed mechanism of a-amylase inhibition of plant defensins; moreover, the results may improve our ability to use plant defensins in agricultural applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS NMR Experiments and Structure Calculations VrD2 was purified from mung bean seeds as described previously.13 All of the NMR experiments were carried out on a 2 mM sample of VrD2 dissolved in 50 mM phosphate buffer (90% H2O and 10% D2O, pH 6.0) containing sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate (d4-TSP) as the internal standard on a Bruker AVANCE 600-MHz NMR spectrometer. Water suppression was achieved by pulsedfield gradient with the 3-9-19 WATER-GATE sequence. NMR spectra were collected in the States-TPPI mode.50 The homonuclear two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy spectra were recorded with 90 ms of mixing time at 288 K, whereas the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 50, 100, and 150 ms at 288, 293, and 298 K. All spectra were acquired with 512 t1 increments and 2048 t2 complex data points with a spectral width of 8389.262 Hz. All recorded spectra were processed using XWIN-nmr (Bruker) and analyzed by SPARKY 3.111.51 The assigned resonances were deposited in Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) under accession code 7092. NOE-based distance constraints were derived by volume integration of correlations observed in the NOESY spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms at 288 K. The assigned peak intensities were derived using a default peak-fitting protocol (in SPARKY 3.111 software) that along with the assumption of Lorenzian line shapes. Calibration of the NOE distance constraint was carried ° out using the known atomic distance of 2.5 A between the Hh2 and Hs3 protons of Trp42. Upper limits of 1.0, 1.5, ° and 2.0 A were added for nonstereospecifically assigned methylene, methyl, and phenyl ring protons, respectively.52 Structure calculations were carried out using the standard torsion angle simulated annealing protocol incorporated within the program CNS 1.1.53 Several rounds of structure calculations were performed to resolve ambiguities in the assignment of NOE cross-signals. A set of 20 structures with the lowest overall energy that had no violations of distance restraints greater than ° 0.2 A was chosen from 100 randomly simulated annealing structures for water refinement. After explicit water refinement using the OPLS force field54 in RECOORD,55 18 structures that had no violation of distance constraints ° greater than 0.23 A were selected for analyses. The structures were evaluated with PROCHECK-NMR.56 The coordinates of both the representative structure and the ensemble of structures have been deposited at the Brookhaven Protein Databank (PDB) as entry 2GL1. Model Building and Docking Study Sequences of VrD2c and wild-type VrD2 were aligned manually. The sequence alignment in the L3 loop region was carefully inspected to ensure that the orientation of these residues was in good agreement with the corresponding residues of VrD1. Modeller57 was then used to

construct the homology model of VrD2c by using the VrD2 structure as a template. The structure with lowest total energy out of 20 structures from Modeller was chosen and refined with 200 steps of steepest descent energy minimization in InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) with the CVFF force-field. The structural model of VrD2c and an X-ray structure of TMA58 were submitted to the PatchDock server59 to predict the binding mode. All of the ranked structures of the complex for all PDB coordinates were visualized. The complex model with the highest score was further refined with 1000 steps of steepest descent energy minimization in the Discover module of the InsightII package with the CVFF force-field. Consequently, the refined model was evaluated by the Protein­ Protein Interaction Server.60 Construction of Expression Plasmids To facilitate the expression and purification of recombinant VrD2 (rVrD2), an expression vector was constructed. First, a PCR-based two-step DNA synthesis method was employed to produce the V. radiate VrD2 gene as described.61 The DNA sequence of the VrD2 gene was deduced from the known peptide sequence (Protein accession number: BAB82453 from National Center for Biotechnology Information) using preferred codons for Escherichia coli. In the first step of DNA synthesis, the reaction was performed so that the oligonucleotides were to anneal with one another and form a short double-stranded sequence. VrD2 gene was synthesized by Pfu DNA polymerase using two oligonucleotides (the base-pairing sequences are underlined): forward oligonucleotide VrD2A (50 -AAA ACT TGT GAA AAC CTG GCG AAT ACC TAT CGT GGT CCG TGC TTC ACA ACC GGG AGC TGT GA C GAT CAT TGC AAG-30 ) and reverse oligonucleotide VrD2-B (50 -GCA GTT TCT CGT ACA CCA GCA GCG AAA ATC ATC GCG ACA CCG GCC AGA ACG TAA GTG CTC TTT ATT CTT GCA ATG ATC G-30 ). To generate the plasmid carrying VrD2, the second step of DNA synthesis was performed by PCR using forward primer BamHI-DPVrD2-F (50 -C GGA TCC GAC CCG AAA ACT TGT GAA AAC CTG GCG-30 ) and reverse primer XhoI-STOP-VrD2R (50 -GTG CTC GAG TTA GCA GTT TCT CGT ACA CCA G-30 ). The two restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI are underlined; the acid-sensitive dipeptide (Asp-Pro) that is immediately upstream of the VrD2 coding sequence is in bold, and the stop codon is in italics. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing VrD2 was cloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the multiple-cloning site of expression vector pET32a(þ) (Novagen, Madison, USA) to generate the plasmid pET32a(þ)-VrD2. On the other hand, the expression vector of VrD1 was also constructed according to the procedures described above. The construction of the alanine insertion mutant (VrD2-41A) was performed with the QuikChange1 SiteDirected Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). The mutagenesis primers were each complementary to opposite strands of the expression plasmid pET32a(þ)VrD2 except for the mutation site. The primers used in

the site-directed mutagenesis were VrD2-41A-F (50 -TGT CGC GAT GAT TTT CGC GCG TGC TGG TGT ACG AGA AAC-30 ) and VrD2-41A-R (50 -GTT TCT CGT ACA CCA GCA CGC GCG AAA ATC ATC GCG ACA-30 ), where the alanine insertion site is in bold. Construction of VrD2c was similar to that of pET32a(þ)-VrD2, except different primers were used for the first round of PCR. The reverse oligonucleotide VrD2C (50 -GCA GTT TCT CGT ACA CCA GCA AGT ACG AGT CAT ACC GCG ACA CCG GCC AGA ACG TAA GTG CTC TTT ATT CTT GCA ATG ATC G-30 ) was paired with the forward oligonucleotide of VrD2-A. The DNA sequence of 37 G-M-T-R-T41 (numbering based on VrD2c) is in italics; nucleotides that form base pairs with VrD2-A are underlined. All of the constructed plasmids were sequenced to verify their nucleotide sequences. Overproduction and Purification of Recombinant Proteins The expression and purification of recombinant proteins were similar to the previous report.62 E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells bearing plasmid pET32a(þ)-VrD1, pET32a(þ)-VrD2, pET32a(þ)-VrD2-41A or pET32a(þ)-VrD2c were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 lg/mL). The fusion proteins possessing an N-terminal tag that consists of a thioredoxin (Trx)-tag, His-tag, S-tag and an acid-sensitive dipeptide were overexpressed after isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM) induction. After incubation at 378C for 3 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and then lysed by sonication in TNM buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1M NaCl). Fusion proteins from the supernatants were separated on a Co2þ-affinity column (BD Biosciences, San Jones, USA) and eluted with 100 mM imidazole. The Asp-Pro bond of the acid-sensitive dipeptide has been shown to be extremely labile when incubated at pH around 1.5.63 Thus, the fractions containing the fusion protein were adjusted to pH 1.4 with 6N HCl and incubated at 558C for 16­18 h to release target proteins from their fusion partners. This acidic cleavage was stopped by neutralizing the pH to 7.0 with NaOH, and the expressed target proteins which contain an extra proline in the N-terminus were further purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The final protein products were verified by mass analysis and characterized by circular dichroism (CD). Protein Identification and Characterization The protein quantification was carried out using the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Pierce Chemical Co., Chester, UK).64 The experimental proteins were characterized and identified based on CD and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectra. The CD spectra were recorded with an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path length cuvette with protein concentrations of 30 lM. CD data were processed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy software). Individual CD spectra were averaged over three scans with a 0.5 nm step size with wavelengths ranging from 260 to 190 nm. The masses of different proteins were

The well-defined region (residue 2­6, 17­26, 32­35, and 41­46) was defined according to the default protocol within the Procheck-NMR.47 The nonbonded energies were calculated using OPLS parameters45 within the RECOORD.46

determined using Micromass Quattro Ultima ESI-MS and calculated using Micromass Maximum Entropy. Purification and Activity Assay of TMA a-Amylase from Tenebrio molitor larvae was extracted and purified as described elsewhere.65 Although the sequences of several insect a-amylases are known, TMA is the only insect a-amylase that has a known 3D structure.58 The TMA inhibitory activities were determined by the Bernford method66 in buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mM CaCl2) with a final concentration of 37 nM a-amylase at 308C. Various concentrations of inhibitors were preincubated with a-amylase for 30 min in 200 lL buffer. The enzymatic reaction was started by adding 250 lL of 0.4% (w/v) Zulkowsky starch. After a 1 0-min incubation, the solution was mixed with 250 lL 1% (w/v) dinitrosalicylic acid in 0.4 M NaOH, heated at 1008C for 5 min, and then cooled on ice. The enzyme activity was monitored by an increase in absorbance at 540 nm. Assays were carried out at least in triplicate. These inhibition values differed by no more than 11%.

ent temperatures (288, 293, and 298 K) helped to solve the chemical shift overlaps unambiguously. Final NOEbased distance constraints were derived from cross-peaks in the 150 ms NOESY spectrum recorded at 288 K (Table I). Several of the up-field chemical shifts of atoms that were observed in VrD2 resulted from the deshielding effect of the p-electron current such as the Hg of Leu6 (shift from 1.5 to 0.0 ppm) and the Hd of Arg36, which were affected by the ring of Trp42, the Hb of Tyr10, which was affected by His23 and the Hb of Cys41, which was affected by Tyr10. Strong Hd(i)Pro-Ha(i-1) NOE signals in the NOE spectra and the fact that Ha(i)Pro-Ha(i-1) connectivities were absent indicate that Pro13 of VrD2 is in

the trans conformation. Three disulfide bond pairs (Cys3Cys47, Cys20-Cys41 and Cys24-Cys43) of VrD2 were identified from the presence in the NOESY spectrum of characteristic short contacts between cysteine Hb protons. The remaining pair, Cys14-Cys35, was assigned based on the preliminary structures that were calculated without any distance constraints for the disulfide bonds. Figure 1 summarizes the sequential and medium-range NOEs observed in the NOESY spectra of VrD2. The secondary structural elements of VrD2 were determined by analyzing the pattern of assigned NOEs.

statistical data from the analysis of these structures are presented in Table I. This set of final structures did not ° violate distance constraints (i.e., >0.23 A). All structures are fully compatible with the standard covalent geometry, since the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values from the ideal geometry are very low (Table I). The ° RMSD values of all residues are 0.69 6 0.20 A and 1.49 6 ° 0.28 A for the backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively.

VrD2 Structure VrD2 has a compact globular conformation comprising an a-helix between residues Thr17 and Lys27 and one triple-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (Thr2-Leu6, Ser32-Arg36, and Cys41-Asn46; Fig. 2). This structure contains a general fold of the well-known cysteine-stabilized ab (CSab) motif. The a-helix is tethered to the central b-strand (b3) of the b-sheet by two disulfide bonds, Cys20-Cys41 and Cys24-Cys43. Strand b2 contains a cysteine that pairs with another in loop L1 (Cys14-Cys35). The consensus sequence of the CSab motif is represented as C14-(X)iC20XXXC24-(X)j-C35-(X)k-C41XC43 in the structure of VrD2. Besides these disulfide bonds, the fourth pair, Cys3-

Cys47, brings the N- and C-termini into close proximity and further stabilizes the structure. In addition to the four disulfide bridges, several residues are important for stabilizing the structure of VrD2. Tyr10 is a crucial residue for maintaining the structural integrity of L1 through its multiple interactions. It makes hydrophobic contacts on one face with the Cys20-Cys41 disulfide bond and interacts with the residues of L1 through its aromatic side chain. A small hydrophobic cluster that is composed of the side chain of Leu30 and the Cys24-Cys43 disulfide bond assists in the packing of the a-helix with the b-sheet. In combination with the side chains of Ala7 and His23, these residues form the hydrophobic core of VrD2 as shown in Figure 2(C). In the intersection of the helix and b2, Gly33 packs tightly with the side chain of Asp21. This glycine residue is conserved in the sequences of most peptides containing a CSab fold, where it seems to be required to provide flexibility between the a-helix and the b-sheet.38 Structural Comparison of VrD2 with VrD1 VrD1 is an insecticidal plant defensin that has also been reported to act as an insect a-amylase inhibitor.17 VrD2 has a low degree of amino acid sequence identity with VrD1 (28%; Fig. 3), but they have similar global structures [Fig. 4(A)]. The topology of the disulfide bonds is identical for both proteins, and the corresponding backbone atoms of secondary structural elements superimpose ° with an RMSD value of 1.46 A. Local structural differences between these two molecules are situated within two loop regions [Fig. 4(A)]. The unique 310 helix (Glu8-Gly11) observed in VrD1 results in a significant difference in the structure of L1 between the two proteins. The L3 between b2 and b3 adopts different conformations because the loop of VrD2 is one residue shorter than that of VrD1. L3 is the proposed region that inserts into the catalytic site of insect a-amylase,17 but whether the 310 helix of VrD1 is involved in this same biological function still needs to be elucidated. Our previous study suggested that a short L3 (3­5 residues) is a requirement for the a-amylase inhibitory activity of plant defensins (Fig. 3) and the positively charged residue in this loop provides an important point of interaction with the enzyme.17 We found that VrD2 contains four residues in L3 but exhibited no activity against TMA (described below). The structural comparison suggests that a different orientation of the positively charged residue of VrD2 (Arg40) when compared with that of VrD1 [Arg38; Fig. 4(B)] may result in this functional variation. A VrD2-41A mutant, which included an alanine insertion at position 41, was produced to mimic the length of L3 and the orientation of the positively charged residue of VrD1. This mutation, however, failed to show any a-amylase inhibitory activity (described later). Even though some flexibility occurs in the L3 loop and side chain amino acids such as arginine can adopt several conformations, some other critical factors appear to restrict the interaction between VrD2 and TMA. Consequently, a vari-

ant VrD2c, which is derived by transferring the proposed functional loop of VrD1 onto the structurally corresponding loop of VrD2 (Fig. 3), was considered to be designed. VrD2 Chimera Homology modeling and computational docking was performed to evaluate the shape complementary between VrD2c and TMA. A homology model of VrD2c was constructed using the VrD2 structure as a template. The theoretical interaction between VrD2c and TMA was generated by PatchDock, which is useful to evaluate shape complementarity between two protein surfaces. In general, an active site consists of an indentation or cleft on the surface of an enzyme molecule that is complementary in shape to the substrate or its inhibitor. In the putative model of a VrD2c-TMA complex, VrD2c bound well to the V-shaped concavity of TMA (Fig. 5). It interacted with residues from both TMA domains that delimit the substratebinding site suggested its potential as a TMA inhibitor. ° ° The total buried surface area amounts to 2544 A2 (1212 A2 ° for TMA and 1332 A2 for VrD2c), which is similar to the ° average of $2815 A2 for the experimentally determined interfacial surface area of the three known inhibitor-TMA structures.17 The interacting interface of VrD2c, as shown in Figure 5(B), was major composed of L3 and some solventexposed residues in the strands. Numerous a-amylase-inhibitor complexes revealed that the active site of TMA is located in the crevice at the interface between domains A (residues 1­97 and 160­379) and B (residues 98­159).46­49 A concentrated negatively charged potential composed of the three catalytic residues Asp185, Glu222, and Asp287, as well as Asp94, was observed in the cleft of TMA [Fig. 5(C)]. The surface of VrD2c shows a highly positive electrostatic potential compared with that of VrD2 and VrD1 suggested its electrostatic complementary to the active site of TMA. On the other hand, although VrD2 contains several positively charged residues such as Arg11, Arg36, and Arg40 that can be attracted to the cleft of the enzyme, the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged groups of VrD2 and TMA

overexpressed the VrD2c in E. coli. The products were then purified and characterized by CD and ESI-MS spectra. The CD spectrum suggests that the mutant secondary structure is similar to that of VrD2. The molecular weight calculated from the ESI-MS spectra indicate that the disulfide-bridges did, indeed, form in this mutant.

Fig. 6. Inhibitory activity of VrD2 and the VrD2 mutants against TMA (Tenebrio molitor a-amylase). TMA inhibitory activity of the VrD2 proteins was determined by measuring the residual a-amylase activity after incubation of TMA with different amounts of the individual proteins, using Zulkowsky starch as substrate.

Insect a-Amylase Inhibitory Activity The results presented here indicate that targeted mutagenesis changes the specificity of VrD2 toward TMA (Fig. 6). With a concentration of 3 lM of VrD2c, $60% of TMA activity was inhibited. In contrast, approximately 90% of TMA activity was retained following incubation with VrD2, rVrD2, or VrD2-41A. The high a-amylase inhibitory activity of VrD2c demonstrates that L3 is involved in the a-amylase inhibition of plant defensins. It is worth noting that VrD2c exhibited higher inhibitory activity than did VrD1, which we believe is caused by the clustered cationic residues in the interacting surface of VrD2c. A smaller contact area between VrD2c and TMA compared with ° VrD1 and TMA (À380 A2) suggests that the differences in activity are not related to this aspect of their 3D structures.

DISCUSSION Whether there is a correlation between bruchid resistance and a-amylase activity of plant defensins remains to be investigated. The dependence of pests (i.e., bruchids) on starch for their energy supply has encouraged current research in the field of pest control with a particular focus on the natural a-amylase inhibitors from crop plants.67­69 Although it is well established that plant proteinase inhibitors play a potent defensive role against pests, their use in combination with the concerted expression of other inhibitors, such as defensins, may constitute an effective pest control strategy.70 Six types of plant a-amylase inhibitors have been isolated based on similarities in their sequences and 3D structures: knottins, plant defensins, and cereal-type, Kunitz-type, thaumatin-like and lectinlike proteins.67,69 Among these families, knottins, plant

defensins, and lectin-like proteins have both antimicrobial and insecticidal activities. Insect pests and pathogens are both responsible for severe crop losses, and the use of these proteins is an attractive way to protect crops. Further, a plant defensin, g-H, which inhibits a-amylase from insect but not mammalian10,71 implied highly target specificity of this family of proteins. Understanding their inhibitory mechanisms as well as the biochemical properties is important in improving their application in agriculture. VrD2 lacks the a-amylase inhibitory activity of VrD1 despite the fact that they have similar 3D structures. The mutant VrD2c is able to inhibit a-amylase, which indicates that the composition of residues in L3 underlies this difference. In plant defensins, relatively few amino acid residues are conserved except for ones that are structurally important (Fig. 3), such as the eight cysteines, Gly33, a hydrophobic residue at position 30 and an aromatic residue at position 10 (numbering relative to VrD2). Although it has been demonstrated that the high sequence variability among plant defensins is responsible for their different mechanisms of action,32 several approaches have defined regions that are important for functional interactions.16,24,26 The mutagenesis studies performed with RsAFP and MtDef2 revealed that the antifungal activities of these defensin proteins are related to L3 and b3.24,26 By docking the defensin Cp-thionin with bovine pancreatic trypsin, L1 of Cp-thionin was suggested to contribute to its trypsin inhibitory activity.16 It is of interest that in all three studies, the charged residues in these functional sites were shown to have the greatest effects on the activities of these proteins. Changing the positive charge potential of L3 by a single amino acid substitution in either MsDef1 (R38Q)24 or RsAFP2 (V39R)26 dramatically affected the cation antagonism72 with respect to their activity against some phytopathogenic fungi. Also, Lys11 of Cp-thionin was suggested to occupy the catalytic site of the enzyme.16 In combination with our results, the distribution of residues in solvent-exposed areas, and especially the distribution of charged residues, has an important role in the functions and activities of plant defensins. Several structure­function analyses have indicated that the highly flexible loops are also involved in determining the function or specificity of proteins with the CSab motif.73­75 The critical regions that determine sweetness of the plant protein brazzein are localized within L2 and L3.73 A hydrophobic cluster within L3 and b2 of the scorpion b-toxin Css4 confers its specificity for mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, Navs.74 Synthesized peptides derived from the L3 sequence of mussel defensin MGD1 can kill gram-positive bacteria by destroying their cell walls.75 It would seem that this structural motif has been used repeatedly as a scaffold for the presentation of a specific sequence in the functional loop to its biological target. The abundance of disulfide bonds in the core of this structural motif [as shown for VrD2 in Fig. 2(C)] indicates that these proteins have a stable scaffold that is suitable for protein engineering. Actually, the plant defensins such as VrD1 and VrD2 indeed exhibited highly thermal stability (data not

shown). In this study, the obviously biological activity of VrD2c has supported the proteins exhibit this scaffold are able to be engineered to acquire a new function or specificity. Our present work has elucidated the interaction between plant defensins and the insect a-amylase. We found that loop length and electrostatic distribution were important factors in determining the activity of plant defensins on insect a-amylase. Our findings suggest that like other CSab motif family members,41,42 defensins allow the insertion of foreign sequences so that they can be engineered to acquire a new function or specificity. The technology of engineered insecticidal proteins makes it a possibility to target specific biochemical and physiological processes within insects. In addition, the mechanism of a-amylase inhibition of VrD2c may provide information to improve the anti-a-amylase activity, and hence, even the insecticidal activity of plant defensins.
