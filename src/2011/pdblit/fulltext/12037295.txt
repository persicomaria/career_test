Structure of product-bound Bacillus caldolyticus uracil phosphoribosyltransferase confirms ordered sequential substrate binding
Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) is part of the salvage pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of UMP. It catalyzes the formation of UMP and pyrophosphate from uracil and -d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Unlike enzymes in the de novo synthesis of UMP, UPRTases have only been found in lower organisms and are therefore potential targets for the development of new antibiotics. UPRTase from Bacillus caldolyticus has been crystallized and the structure has been determined by isomorphous replaceÊ ment and re®ned to 3.0 A resolution. UPRTase from B. caldolyticus forms a dimer with the active sites pointing away from each other. A long arm from each subunit wraps around the other subunit, contributing half of the dimer interface. The monomer adopts the phosphoribosyltransferase type I fold, with a small C-terminal hood de®ning the uracilbinding site. The structure contains a well de®ned UMP molecule in the active site. The binding of UMP involves two sequence segments that are highly conserved among UPRTases. The ®rst segment, Asp131±Ser139, contains the PRPP-binding consensus sequence motif known from other type I phosphoribosyltransferases and binds the ribose5H -phosphate part of UMP. The second segment, Tyr193± Ala201, which is speci®c for uracil phosphoribosyltransferases, binds the uracil part of UMP through backbone contacts, partly mediated by a water molecule. Modelling of a PRPP± enzyme complex reveals that uracil can be activated to its tautomeric enol form by the complex. This is consistent with kinetic data, which display ordered sequential binding of substrates, with PRPP binding ®rst. Based on this observation, a reaction mechanism is proposed.

1. Introduction
UMP is the common precursor of all pyrimidine nucleotides and may be synthesized either de novo from intermediates of central metabolism or via salvage of preformed pyrimidine nucleobases or nucleosides. The salvage pathways represent a signi®cant energy saving for the cell and they de®ne the sensitivity of the cell towards cytotoxic pyrimidine analogues (Neuhard, 1983). A key enzyme in microbial pyrimidine salvage is uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase1). It catalyzes the formation of UMP and pyrophosphate from uracil and -d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) in

the presence of Mg2+. The phosphoribosyl transfer occurs with inversion at the anomeric C1 carbon of the ribose ring. The enzyme has been partially characterized from eubacteria (Jensen & Mygind, 1996; Jensen et al., 1997; Jyssum & Jyssum, 1979; McIvor et al., 1983; Michell & Finch, 1979), archaea (Linde & Jensen, 1996) and lower eukaryotes (Alloush & Kerridge, 1994; Asai et al., 1990; Carter et al., 1997; Dai et al., 1995; Natalini et al., 1979; Plunkett & Moner, 1978). It appears to be absent from higher eukaryotes (Traut & Jones, 1996), although it has been reported to be present in pea seedlings (Bressan et al., 1978). The UPRTases from the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and from the Gram-positive thermophile Bacillus caldolyticus are the only prokaryotic UPRTases that have been puri®ed to homogeneity (Jensen & Mygind, 1996; Jensen et al., 1997). They show 45% aminoacid sequence identity and both were found to obey the kinetics of a sequential reaction mechanism, with PRPP binding before uracil and UMP leaving last (Lundegaard & Jensen, 1999; Jensen & Neuhard, unpublished experiments). The true KM values for uracil and PRPP were found to be 0.5 and 58 mM, respectively, for the E. coli enzyme and 0.9 and 37 mM, respectively, for the B. caldolyticus enzyme. Despite these similarities, the two enzymes differ in quarternary structure in solution. Thus, the E. coli enzyme appears to be a pentamer or hexamer in its active form (Lundegaard & Jensen, 1999), whereas the enzymatically active form of the B. caldolyticus enzyme is a dimer (Jensen et al., 1997).

UPRTases appear to belong to the type I phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTases), which contain a conserved 13-residue sequence segment termed the PRPP-binding motif (Hershey & Taylor, 1986; Hove-Jensen et al., 1986). Type I PRTases are involved in the de novo synthesis of IMP and UMP, in the salvage of purines and pyrimidines and in the biosynthesis of the amino acids histidine and tryptophan (Jensen, 1983). Type II PRTases, which include the nicotinate and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferases involved in pyridine nucleotide synthesis, do not show the conserved PRPP-binding motif in their amino-acid sequences (Eads et al., 1997). The three-dimensional structures of a number of type I PRTases have been determined, including OPRTases from Salmonella typhimurium (Scapin et al., 1994, 1995) and E. coli (Henriksen et al., 1996), GPATases from B. subtilis (Smith et al., 1994; Chen et al., 1997) and E. coli (Krahn et al., 1997; Muchmore et al., 1998), H/G/XPRTases from human (Eads et al., 1994; Shi, Li, Tyler, Furneaux, Grubmeyer et al., 1999; Balendiran et al., 1999) and from the protozoan parasites Tritrichomonas foetus (Somoza et al., 1996), E. coli (Vos et al., 1997, 1998), Trypanosoma cruzi (Focia, Craig, Nieves-Alicia et al., 1998; Focia, Craig & Eakin, 1998), Toxoplasma gondii Â (Schumacher et al., 1999; Heroux et al., 1999, 2000) and Plasmodium falciparum (Shi, Li, Tyler, Furneaux, Cahill et al., 1999). The structures of UPRTase from Tox. gondii (Schumacher et al., 1998) and APRTase from Leishmania donovani (Phillips et al., 1999) have also recently been determined. The type I PRTases (Fig. 1) share a characteristic fold consisting of a core region with a ¯exible loop and a hood. The hood supplies the residues required for binding of the nucleobase and is either formed by N-terminal residues (OPRTase, APRTase) or by C-terminal residues (HGPRTase, UPRTase). The active-site cleft is situated between the hood and the core harbouring the PRPP-binding sequence. It has been proposed that enzyme-catalyzed phosphoribosyl-group transfer involves an oxocarbenium-ion intermediate/transition state (Goitein et al., 1978; Tao et al., 1996) which would require protection from solvent to prevent PRPP hydrolysis. The ¯exible loop is proposed to close down onto the active site during catalysis to protect the intermediate/transition state from hydrolysis (Henriksen et al., 1996; Schumacher et al., 1999). In the twodomain structure of PRPP synthetase, each domain adopts the type I PRTase fold even though the enzyme is not a PRTase (Eriksen et al., 2000). In the present paper, we describe the crystal structure of Ê B. caldolyticus UPRTase bound to its product, UMP, at 3.0 A resolution. Based on the structure, we have modelled an enzyme±substrate complex and propose a possible reaction mechanism. diffusion using hanging or sitting drops. An initial crystal screen was set up as described by Jancarik & Kim (1991) and manufactured by Hampton Research. The protein solution contained UPRTase at a concentration of 20 mg mlÀ1 with 5 mM inorganic phosphate at pH 7.0 and hanging drops were composed of 3 ml protein solution and 3 ml reservoir. The best results from the crystal screen were hair-like structures and small needle-shaped crystals which appeared under conditions that had in common pH 7.5/8.5 and PEG 4000/6000 as precipitant. The crystallization conditions were optimized to give large three-dimensional crystals (Fig. 2). The crystals used for structure determination were grown at 293 K with the abovementioned protein solution. Sitting drops were prepared from 7 ml protein solution and 7 ml reservoir solution from a 1 ml reservoir composed of 6±10% PEG 4000 with 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5. Usually, crystals appeared after three weeks of equilibration. The maximal dimensions of the crystals, which appeared as truncated hexagonal bipyramids, were about 1.0 Â 0.5 Â 0.5 mm. Often, hair-like structures were observed in addition to crystals in the drop (Fig. 2). With our in-house equipment (see below), the best crystals Ê diffracted to about 3.6 A resolution. The crystals belong to space group P3121, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 89.4, Ê c = 163.7 A. Assuming a molecular weight of 22 817 Da and two molecules per asymmetric unit, VM (Matthews, 1968) is Ê calculated to be 4.1 A3 DaÀ1, corresponding to 70% solvent in the crystal. This is consistent with a self-rotation function calculated with the program AMoRe (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; Navaza, 1994), which indicated the existence of a non-crystallographic twofold axis.

Sitting drops were composed of 7 ml of the above-mentioned protein solution and 7 ml reservoir solution composed of 6±10% PEG 4000 and 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5.

2.4. Refinement

Ê A synchrotron data set extending to 3.0 A resolution was collected at the EMBL in Hamburg from a capillary-mounted single crystal cooled to 263 K. Data-collection statistics are given in Table 1. With this data set, the structure was initially È re®ned using the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992), while later re®nements were performed with the program CNS È (Brunger et al., 1998) using twofold NCS restraints and bulksolvent modelling. Between cycles of re®nement the structure was manually corrected based on NCS-averaged 3mFo À 2DFc and mFo À DFc maps (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; Read, 1986) using the graphics-display program TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1992). The ®nal model consists of a dimer in the asymmetric unit, with

each subunit consisting of amino acids Gly2±Lys209, one UMP molecule and a water molecule. This model with neighbourrestrained B-factor optimization re®ned to an R factor of 22.3% and an Rfree of 27.0%. The model shows good stereochemistry, with r.m.s. deviations from standard values of Ê 0.007 A for bond distances and 1.43 for bond angles. A Ramachandran plot calculated with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed 83.3% of nonglycine and non-proline residues in the most favoured regions and 16.1% in the additionally allowed regions. Only one residue, Leu48, was found just outside in the generously allowed regions.

3. Results and discussion
The crystal structure of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase from the thermophilic bacterium B. caldolyticus has been deterÊ mined and re®ned to 3.0 A resolution. The structure contains a dimer in the asymmetric unit, each monomer being composed of residues Gly2±Lys209. Since no UMP had been added to the crystallization mixture, an unexpected result of the structure determination was the presence of a UMP molecule in the active site, re¯ecting a strong product binding.

The TGUPRTase (with bound UMP; PDB code 1upu) subunit A is superposed the BCUPRTase subunit A. The segments TGAsn35±TGMet39, TG TG TG TG Thr42±TGLeu78, Tyr102±TGArg126, Arg129±TGIle135, Lys145±TGLys186, TG Arg189±TGThr243 and TGU5P999 were ®tted to BCLys3±BCPhe7, BCHis9±BCThr45, BC Gly69±BCPro93, BCLys96±BCLeu102, BCVal112±BCLys153, BCSer154±BCThe208 and BC U5P250, respectively, using all atoms for conserved residues and backbone atoms only for the rest. The gaps cover inserts and bulges which obviously did not ®t well and include the dimer arm and the ¯exible loop. A total of 934 non-H atoms were paired, giving an r.m.s.d. of Ê 1.24 A. This ®gure and Figs. 4 and 5 were produced with the program TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1992).

The monomer possesses both -strand and -helix secondary-structural elements. We have assigned 11 -strands and six -helices (Fig. 1). The structural core contains a central seven-stranded -sheet (1, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5 and 6) surrounded by -helices (1±5). Six of the -strands form an extended parallel sheet with the ¯anking strand, 6, running antiparallel. This core is classi®ed as a type I PRTase fold, which is the most abundant fold seen for PRTase structures. The secondary-structural elements are, with three exceptions, connected by short loops, giving a rather compact fold. The antiparallel strands 5 and 6 are connected via a long loop known as the `PRTase ¯exible loop'. Another structural feature, unique to the UPRTase structure, are two antiparallel -strands (2 and 3) that seem to be important for dimer stabilization. Finally, a C-terminal hood contains two short antiparallel -strands (10 and 11) and an -helix (6). As will be shown, this hood is also unique to the UPRTase structure and is involved in uracil recognition. A feature common to PRTases is the use of PRPP as one of the substrates, suggesting the evolution of a common fold (the type I PRTase fold; Fig. 1) which can bind PRPP. In

UPRTase, this fold is represented by strands 4±9 together with helices 2±5. The PRPP recognition is shared by two subsites. One subsite (formed by the loop between strand 7 and helix 4) binds the ribose-5H -phosphate (R5P) part of PRPP. The other subsite (formed by the loop between strand 4 and helix 3) binds the pyrophosphate (PPi) part of PRPP. A cis-peptide is often found in the PPi-binding loop (residue cis-Arg79 in this structure). Another characteristic feature of the type I PRTase fold is an extension of three -strands in the core. In UPRTase, strands 7, 8 and 9 have extensions 7H , 8H and 9H , respectively. These extra -strands form a small parallel sheet almost perpendicular to the core sheet. This special structure seems to de®ne the architecture of the R5Pbinding site, which extends from the C-terminal end of strand 7 to the N-terminal end of helix 4.
3.2. The dimer

area. Without residues Leu50±Ile67, the interaction surface Ê area is 941 A2 per monomer. The dimer arm has an uncharged face interacting with the corpus of the other monomer and a solvent-exposed face comprising exclusively charged residues. Interestingly, strand 2 is rich in negatively charged residues (Glu51, Glu52, Glu54 and Glu56), while strand 3 is rich in positively charged residues (Lys61, Arg63 and Lys65). The side chains are in favourable positions to form a zipper-like system of putative salt bridges (Lys65±Glu52±Arg63±Glu54± Lys61±Glu56) stabilizing the dimer arm. The last residue in this system, Glu56, is in turn involved in a salt bridge Glu56A/B±Lys22B/A, which holds the tip of the dimer arm and the corpus of the opposite monomer together.
3.3. Crystal packing

The crystal contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit organized as a tightly entwined dimer (Fig. 3). The dimer is symmetric and has an ellipsoid shape overall with dimensions Ê of 29 Â 48 Â 88 A. The accessible surface areas of the dimer and the monomer were calculated with the program GRASP Ê Ê (Nicholls et al., 1991) to be 18 290 A2 and 11 097 A2, respecÊ tively, which showed that 1952 A2 (17.6%) of the monomer surface is involved in the dimer interaction. The dimer is held together by 12 hydrogen bonds, of which four are salt bridges: Lys22A/B±Glu56B/A (see also below) and Glu43A/B± Arg46B/A. The latter is in the middle of the dimer. Strands 2 and 3 (Leu50±Ile67; hereafter referred to as the dimer arm) contribute about half of the dimer-interaction

The modest resolution of the diffraction observed from the B. caldolyticus UPRTase crystals is not consistent with what would be expected from a thermophilic enzyme. However, analysis of the crystal packing gives an explanation for this observation. The most prominent packing contacts are long chains of dimers perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis.

The chains loosely stack in the c-axis direction as alternating layers with a period of three, so that the chains from one layer form a 60 angle to the chains of the next layer (Fig. 4). There is no interaction between parallel chains in the same layer. Consistently, ®brous structures are often observed in the crystallization drop along with crystals (Fig. 2). The interactions between dimers in a chain appear to be strong compared with the intermolecular crystal contacts normally observed in protein crystals. The interaction surface Ê area, calculated as above, amounts to 1840 A2 or 10% of the dimer surface. This area is of the same magnitude as that which forms the dimers. The contacts comprise eight hydrogen bonds, of which four are between charged residues: Arg30A/BÁ Á ÁAsp105B/A and Asp86A/BÁ Á ÁLys117B/A. These residues are not sequentially conserved among UPRTases.
3.4. The active site and UMP binding

After having constructed and re®ned the polypeptide chain, clear residual electron density was found at the active site (Fig. 5) despite there having been no addition of UMP to the crystallization mixture. When UMP was included in the re®nement, a restrained temperature-factor optimization showed thermal B factors for UMP that were comparable with those of surrounding residues, implying that the UMP site is fully occupied. The unexpected presence of UMP in the crystals points to strong product binding. The conformation of UMP bound to UPRTase is the same as the conformation of UMP found in the small-molecule crystal structure of its sodium salt (Seshadri et al., 1980) and which is classi®ed as an anti conformation. This indicates that UMP binds to the

enzyme in a relaxed conformation, which explains the strong binding and might be one of the driving forces towards the product. The direct interaction between the enzyme and UMP involves the two segments Asp131±Ser139 and Tyr193±Ala201 (Figs. 5 and 6). The ®rst segment is part of the type I PRTase core and contains the PRPP-binding consensus-sequence motif. Firstly, residue Asp131, which is situated at the end of -strand 7, is hydrogen bonded to the ribose moiety of UMP. It binds via its carboxylate group, where the O1 and O2 atoms accept a proton from O2H and O3H , respectively. There is then a stretch of structural support (7H ) with a few close van der Waals interactions to the uracil moiety, notably from the side chains of Met133 and Ala135. The last part of the segment de®nes the 5H -phosphate-binding loop, Ala135±Ser139, connecting -strand 7H and -helix 4. The 5H -phosphate O atoms of UMP accept hydrogen bonds from the backbone atoms Ala135 N, Thr136 N, Gly137 N and Ser139 N, as well as from the side-chain atoms Thr136 O and Ser139 O. The second segment involved in UMP binding is Tyr193± Ala201 at the C-terminus between -strand 9 and -helix 6. It interacts exclusively with the uracil part of UMP. This interaction involves backbone atoms and is partly mediated by a water molecule. The uracil O2 atom accepts a proton from Ala201 N, while N3 donates a proton to Gly199 O. O4 of uracil accepts protons from a water molecule and from Ile194 N. The water molecule in turn donates a proton to Ile194 O and accepts protons from Leu198 N and Gly199 N. This water molecule is, apart from lateral hydrogen bonds, con®ned to a partly hydrophobic environment. It is sandwiched between and has close van der Waals interactions with the side chain of Val59, situated at the tip of the dimer arm of the opposite monomer, and the side chain of Met133. The uracil-binding loop contains a cis-peptide bond between Val195 and Pro196. A very similar binding of uracil is seen in the structure of dUTPase from E. coli complexed with dUDP (Dauter et al., 1998). Here, the binding of uracil also involves only backbone atoms and is mediated in the same way by a water molecule. Comparison with orotate phosphoribosyltransferase complexed with orotate and PRPP (Scapin et al., 1995) identi®es the loop between -strand 4 and -helix 3 as a putative binding site for the pyrophosphate part of PRPP. This PPi loop contains a cis-peptide bond between Leu78 and Arg79.

A close-up stereoview of the active site with the product UMP bound. Two parts of the enzyme contributes to the binding of UMP: the segment Asp131±Ser139, which includes the PRPPbinding motif characteristic of type I PRTases, binds the ribose-5-phosphate part of UMP, while the C-terminal segment Tyr193±Ala201 binds the uracil part. The binding of uracil is de®ned by backbone atoms only and is mediated by a characteristic water molecule.

UPRTase (BCUPRTase). In the area where the two sequences overlap and can be aligned, they share 75 out of 209 identical amino-acid residues. Initially, the TGUPRTase (with bound UMP; PDB code 1upu) subunit A was superposed with the BCUPRTase subunit A (Fig. 3). Gaps, inserts and bulges which obviously did not ®t well and which include the dimer arm and ¯exible loop were omitted from the ®t. Backbone atoms together with side-chain atoms for conserved residues were included in the ®t: a total of Ê 934 non-H atom pairs with an r.m.s.d. of 1.24 A. Not surprisingly, the two structures superimpose best around the active site. UMP can be superposed with an r.m.s.d. Ê of 0.21 A for all 21 non-H atoms and in general its immediate surroundings ®t within experimental accuracy. However, some differences are seen in connection with the hydrophobic interactions with the uracil ring. The substitutions TG Leu196/BCIle161 and TGIle233/BCLeu198 cause the TG Met166/BCMet133 side chains to adopt different conformations and TGTyr228/BCTyr193 to have different 12 angles. The TGTyr228 and BCTyr193 aromatic ring plane make angles of 95 and 55 with the uracil-ring plane for the TGUPRTase and BCUPRTase complexes, respectively. Further away from the active site, the superpositional ®t becomes poorer. The dimers have a different twist and cannot be superposed as a whole. When the upper subunits are superposed as described above (Fig. 3) the lower subunits do not ®t and vice versa. In order to transform an upper ®t into a Ê lower ®t a 16 rotation is required, followed by a 2.3 A translation along the screw axis shown in Fig. 3. This means that the TGUPRTase dimer is in a tighter conformation than the BCUPRTase dimer and needs to be unwound slightly to ®t the latter. It remains to be shown whether this difference arises from the species variation or re¯ects a kind of `breathing' motion associated with the enzyme function. Here, it should be noted that the crystals of Tox. gondii and B. caldolyticus UPRTases were obtained under very different conditions using 1.0 M ammonium sulfate/phosphate and 6±10% PEG 4000 as precipitants, respectively. The authors have observed no `breathing' motion in the four TGUPRTase structures deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes 1bd3, 1bd4, 1upf and 1upu). Even though the dimer arm was not included in the superpositional ®t, the upper part from the opposite subunit close to the active site matches well. The backbone adopts similar conformations until the conserved TGPro91/BCPro58. An insertion in Tox. gondii (TGAsp93) causes a bulge right after TGLeu92/BCVal59 that compensates for the shorter BC Val59 side chain, so that the isopropyl groups of the two residues occupy approximately the same position within van der Waals interaction distance of TGTyr228/BCTyr193. Another conserved feature is a salt-bridge anchor from the corpus to just below the tip: TGLys55A±TGAsp93D/BCLys22A± BC Glu56B. The lysines are at equivalent positions in the corpus structures, while BCGlu56 and TGAsp93 are positioned before and after the conserved BCPro58/TGPro91, respectively. Further down the dimer arm, the interactions with the corpus are much weaker in both structures. This produces the possibility that the dimer arm can slide on the corpus surface, leaving the dimer with a certain ¯exibility.
3.6. Insight into catalysis from modelling an enzyme± substrate complex

It has been demonstrated that UPRTases follow ordered sequential kinetics with the substrate PRPP binding ®rst and the product UMP leaving last (Lundegaard & Jensen, 1999; Jensen & Neuhard, unpublished results). In order to understand this at a molecular level, we ®rst modelled a PRPP± UPRTase complex. For simplicity, we have assumed that the R5P part of PRPP is close to that observed in the UMP± UPRTase complex, leaving only the PPi part to be modelled. We therefore used the PRPP molecule (actually cPRPP, with O4 of the ribose ring substituted with CH2) from the complex with E. coli XGPRTase (Vos et al., 1998; PDB code 1a95) as a template (Fig. 7). Firstly, atoms C1, C2 and C5 of cPRPP were manually superposed with the equivalent atoms C1, C2 and O4 of UMP, letting cPRPP move as a rigid body. This was performed in order to obtain the correct geometry of the junction at C1. From there, the four torsion angles between C1 and the  P atom were allowed to move in order to dock the PPi moiety to the enzyme. With these constraints, we could ®nd only one sterically plausible conformation. This conformation had hydrogen-bond contacts between the -phosphate group and the enzyme around Figure 7 cis-Arg79.

The substrate molecules uracil and When PRPP is placed in the active site, it PRPP are shown (black bonds) superposed onto the actual enzyme±product complex (white H becomes clear that owing to steric reasons bonds) for which the structure was determined.

aromatic ring plane. Placing uracil to have a %-stacking with Tyr193 gives, in addition to the role of this residue in guiding uracil to its ®nal position, a clue to how the substrate is activated. It is likely that uracil in this position will adopt its tautomeric enol form, with a double bond between N1 and C2 and the N1 proton repositioned to O2 (Fig. 8). The enol form is favoured by O2 being able to donate its proton in hydrogen bonding to the carboxylate group of Asp200 and the -phosphate group of PRPP. This means that when the enol uracil enters further into the active site, the proton is in an ideal position to move towards OP1 of the -phosphate group and thereby simultaneously activate uracil as a nucleophile and PPi as a leaving group. As mentioned above, Val59 from the opposite subunit is in van der Waals contact with both Tyr193 and the water molecule in the uracil-binding site. Enzyme movement may deliver, via dimer-arm stimulation at the uracil-binding site, the activation energy required to move from an activated complex to the product. Flexibility in the site seems to be ensured by the conserved glycines 197 and 199, by the water molecule and in general by this part of the structure being a C-terminal protrusion. In entering the active site, it is likely that uracil orients itself by having its dipole moment aligned with that of -helix 6. In the present model, the conformation of the PPi part of PRPP is consistent with observations made from HGPRTase in complex with the transition-state analogue ImmGP and Mg2+±PPi (Shi, Li, Tyler, Furneaux, Cahill et al., 1999; Shi, Li, Tyler, Furneaux, Grubmeyer et al., 1999). A shortcoming of our model is that we cannot directly infer the location of the magnesium ions. By comparison with the HGPRTase complex, candidates for two Mg2+-binding sites would be between the PPi moiety and Asp200 and Asp131, respectively (Fig. 7). In this context, one should recall that the PRPP-binding motif of UPRTases differs from that of all other PRTases by having the sequence Asp131-Pro132 instead of two acidic residues (Glu-Asp in OPRTase/HGPRTase and Asp-Asp in GPATase/ APRTase). This may have an impact on the binding of Mg2+. The reaction of type I PRTases has been proposed to proceed via a ribooxocarbenium-ion transition state (Grubmeyer & Wang, 1998; Shi, Li, Tyler, Furneaux, Cahill et al., 1999; Shi, Li, Tyler, Furneaux, Grubmeyer et al., 1999). The acidic residues of the PRPP-binding motif just mentioned (Asp-Pro, Glu-Asp or Asp-Asp close to the ribose ring) are obvious candidates for an overall stabilization of such a transition state. Because of the less acidic Asp131-Pro132 in UPRTases, one could speculate that other acidic groups such as Asp200 and Asp203 may also be involved in the overall stabilization of the transition state. We are grateful to the EMBL Hamburg outstation c/o DESY for beam time and assistance during experiments. This research has been supported by the Danish National Research Foundation.

Proposed catalytic mechanism for uracil phosphoribosyltransferase: when PRPP is bound to the enzyme and uracil enters the active site (Fig. 7), uracil is stabilized as the enol tautomer. When in the enol form, uracil enters deeper into the active site and the shown electron translocation takes place, completing the reaction.
