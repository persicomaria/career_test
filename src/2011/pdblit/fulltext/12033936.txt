C8 is a 22-kDa subunit of human C8, which is one of five components of the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement (MAC). C8 is disulfide-linked to a C8R subunit that is noncovalently associated with a C8 chain. In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of recombinant C8 was determined by X-ray diffraction to 1.2 Å resolution. The structure displays a typical lipocalin fold forming a calyx with a distinct binding pocket that is indicative of a ligand-binding function for C8. When compared to other lipocalins, the overall structure is most similar to neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), a protein released from granules of activated neutrophils. Notable differences include a much deeper binding pocket in C8 as well as variation in the identity and position of residues lining the pocket. In C8, these residues allow ligand access to a large hydrophobic cavity at the base of the calyx, whereas corresponding residues in NGAL restrict access. This suggests the natural ligands for C8 and NGAL are significantly different in size. Cys40 in C8, which forms the disulfide bond to C8R, is located in a partially disordered loop (loop 1, residues 38-52) near the opening of the calyx. Access to the calyx may be regulated by movement of this loop in response to conformational changes in C8R during MAC formation.

ABSTRACT:

Human C8 is a subunit of the eighth component of complement (C8), which is one of five components (C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9) that interact to form the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement, or MAC1 (1, 2). C8 is composed of an R (Mr ) 64 000), (Mr ) 64 000), and  (Mr ) 22 000) subunit. These subunits are produced from different genes and are secreted in the form of a disulfidelinked C8R- dimer that is noncovalently associated with C8 (3). Studies of the individual subunits have provided considerable insight into the role of C8R and C8 in the

formation and function of the MAC (4-9). By contrast, little is known about the role of C8 (reviewed in ref 10). C8 is not required for the synthesis and secretion of C8R; C8R can be expressed independently as a recombinant protein. Binding between C8R- and C8 is likewise not dependent on C8; purified C8R and C8 can form a noncovalent complex in the absence of C8. This dimer exhibits C8-like activity; therefore, C8 is not essential for incorporation of C8 into the MAC, nor is it required for expression of MAC cytolytic activity. A major goal of the present study was to gain further insight into the function of C8 by determining its three-dimensional structure. C8 was initially identified as a lipocalin based on its sequence and genomic organization (11, 12). Within the complement system, it has the distinction of being the only lipocalin, and among the lipocalins it is one of only a few that occur as a disulfide-linked heterodimer, i.e., C8R-. Lipocalins are a large family of proteins that generally bind small, hydrophobic ligands yet can also bind to large soluble macromolecules as well as cell-surface receptors (13, 14). They are widely distributed in vertebrates and invertebrates and are involved in many diverse processes such as retinol transport, olfaction, pheromone binding, invertebrate coloration, and prostaglandin synthesis. The core structure, or lipocalin fold, is highly conserved among family members. It consists of an eight-stranded, antiparallel -barrel which defines a calyx that encloses a ligand binding site (15). Loops linking the strands are generally short -hairpins, except the first loop, which is often larger and located near the opening

Crystal Structure of Human C8 of the calyx where it may restrict ligand access. There is a short 310 helix at the N-terminus and an R-helix near the C-terminus. Residues lining the interior of the calyx and the size of the calyx vary among family members; hence, lipocalins exhibit different ligand specificities. In the present study, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of human C8. Results indicate that C8 displays a typical lipocalin fold with a distinct binding site for a small molecule. This suggests the principal function of C8 is to bind an as yet unidentified ligand, either one that is soluble or one associated with the target membrane on which the MAC is formed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of C8. Human recombinant C8 containing a Cys40 f Gly40 mutation was produced in High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) and purified using a modification of previously published procedures (16). Following batch absorption of the medium and dialysis, the protein was applied to a FPLC Source 15S ion-exchange column (0.5 × 9 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 0.1 to 1.5 M NaCl gradient in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Fractions containing C8 were pooled and applied to a Sephacryl S-100 column (1.6 × 60 cm) in 25 mM imidazole, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2. Recovered protein was pooled, concentrated, and used directly for crystallizations. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was determined using 1% ) 17.4 (16). 280 Crystallization. Crystals of C8 were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C from solutions containing 0.3-0.5 mg/mL protein in the above buffer, 28%-36% PEG 4000 and 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 4.0. Typical crystals had dimensions of 0.25 × 0.15 × 0.05 mm and a tabular, orthorhombic morphology. The crystals belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a ) 42.03 Å, b ) 58.51 Å, c ) 71.99 Å and one monomer per asymmetric unit (solvent content ) 45%). HeaVy Atom DeriVatization. To produce platinum derivatives, crystals were placed in drops containing 1 mM K2PtCl4 in 40% PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0. After 2 days, a few dry crystals of K2PtCl4 were added directly to the drop, which was then allowed to sit undisturbed for two weeks. Bromide ion derivatives were obtained with a short soak (45 s) in artificial mother liquor containing 0.95 M NaBr. To obtain Xe derivatives, crystals were mounted on a loop, inverted, and placed in a Molecular Structure Corporation CRYO-Xe-SITER preequilibrated with mother liquor. The crystals were then exposed to Xe gas at a pressure of 230 psi for 10 min. After pressurization, the crystals were removed from the chamber and immediately placed in liquid N2 to reduce Xe sublimation from the crystal. Data Collection and Refinement. Data were collected at the Structural Biology Center beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Crystals were transferred to artificial mother liquors containing 2% glycerol as the cryoprotectant, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and diffracted at a temperature of -160 °C. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data (Br- and Pt derivatives) were collected at four wavelengths: downstream remote (1), inflection point (2), peak of X-ray absorption (3), and upstream remote (4). Wavelengths producing the minimum

f  (2) and maximum f  (4) were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectra. Single wavelength data for the native protein and the Xe derivative were collected at 1 and 1.54 Å, respectively. All data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (Table 1) (17). Initial phases were obtained using 20.0-2.5 Å resolution data from three experiments: Pt MAD, Br- MAD, and Xe single wavelength anomalous dispersion. Heavy atom localization and phasing calculations were carried out with the standard scripts in the program SOLVE (18). A total of 12 heavy atoms/anomalous scatters (1 Pt, 9 Br-, and 2 Xe) were included in Patterson correlation refinement. The electron density was improved though the maximum likelihood density modification algorithm as implemented in RESOLVE (19, 20). Initial maps were calculated with the CCP4 programs suite (21). The resulting map showed most of the main chain structure along with some side chain electron density allowing for the construction of approximately 90% of the final model. Subsequent model building and refinement was performed with Turbo Frodo and CNS, respectively (22, 23). Intermediate structures were compared to SIGMAA-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps and revised accordingly (24). The partial model was then refined against the native data set, which is 92.2% complete with an average I/ ) 29.6 (63.3% complete with an average I/ ) 1.6 in the last shell). The progress of refinement was monitored by a decrease in both Rcryst and Rfree at each stage of simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual isotropic B-factor refinement. The resolution of the electron density maps was extended incrementally during each round of refinement and manual rebuilding, reaching 1.2 Å in the final round. The final model contains 185 water molecules and one citrate anion and

Geometry of the final model was evaluated with PROCHECK (25) and showed 88.7% of the residues in the most favored conformation. 10.6% of the residues are located in additionally allowed regions while one residue (Tyr 112) is located in a disallowed region. Inspection of both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps in this region revealed that this residue fits well to the electron density and that its unusual conformation is correct. An additional set of data was collected for crystals soaked in the crystallization solution adjusted to pH 7.0. The structure was refined at a resolution of 1.9 Å to an R ) 23.9% and Rfree ) 25.5%. No major structural differences were observed between the two models except for the absence of the bound citrate ion at the opening of the calyx. A superposition of CR atoms resulted in an rms deviation of 0.57 Å and showed no major pH-dependent loop shifts. C8R Peptide Binding. A synthetic peptide containing the sequence found at the putative C8 binding site in C8R (GELRYDSTGERLYYGDDEKY) was prepared as described elsewhere (26). This sequence corresponds to C8R residues 157-175 and has been modified by addition of an N-terminal Gly and a Cys164 f Gly164 substitution. For crystal soaking, the peptide was solubilized in 0.36 M sodium citrate, pH 4.0, at room temperature. This solution was then adjusted with 50% PEG 4000 to create an artificial mother liquor containing the peptide, 36% PEG, and 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 4.0. A single crystal of C8 was introduced into a drop containing the artificial mother liquor and allowed to equilibrate for one month. Data were collected under cryo conditions employing a Rigaku rotating anode source at 50 kV and 100 mA with Yale mirror optics and an R-Axis IV area detector at a distance of 100 mm. Data were processed with HKL2000; however, after rejection of reflections with I < 1(I), the data set was only 76.3% complete to 1.77 Å resolution (79.3% in the 1.84-1.77 shell) with 13 618 unique reflections and Rmerge ) 6.2%. RESULTS Quality of the Model. Figure 1 illustrates the quality of the electron density maps, which allowed for the unambiguous placement of nearly all 182 amino acids in C8.

Loop regions are designated L1-L7. L1 lies between strand A (G29-G37) and B (T53-Q60); however, due to its disorder only part of the loop is shown. L2 lies between B and C (A63-L72), L3 lies between C and D (I75-D85), and L4, which cannot be seen in this view because it falls behind the structure, lies between D and E (R91-R94). L5 lies between E and F (V103T110), L6 lies between F and G (F115-R122), and L7 lies between G and H (Q125-A132). Helix H3 lies between strand H and I (I159-Y161); strand I is joined to J (V176-D178) by a random coil. A citrate molecule from the crystallization buffer is shown at the opening of the calyx.

Exceptions include the first nine N-terminal residues and two C-terminal residues, which were disordered, residues F42H48 that comprise a disordered portion of a loop spanning the open end of the calyx (loop 1), and the side chain atoms of R41, R49, and R97-R100, which were not well defined in the 2Fo - Fc density map. Also, the side chains of S134, S140, Q150, and F162 displayed two alternative conformations. OVerall Structure.

FIGURE 3: Stereoview of NGAL (magenta) superimposed on C8 (blue). Loops are numbered as they occur in the primary structure. Loop 1 (N39-Y52 in NGAL and S38-A52 in C8) is shown as incomplete for C8 because of disorder in residues F42-H48. Loop 7 (R128Y132 in NGAL and A123-G124 in C8) extends further upward in NGAL as compared to C8. Loops 3 and 5 in C8 are also shifted with respect to NGAL. Loop 3 (K73-K74 in NGAL and D73-G74 in C8) is shifted 3 Å away from the calyx, whereas loop 5 (G95G102 in NGAL and Q95-A102 in C8) is shifted 5 Å in toward the calyx leading to a slight overall narrowing of the binding site.

FIGURE 4: Molecular surfaces of C8 and NGAL colored according to electrostatic potential. Positive charge is in blue and negative charge in red. Both molecules are in approximately the same orientation to allow for viewing into the calyces. Ligands are rendered in as rods with carbons in white and oxygens in red. NGAL is shown with a copurified free fatty acid that only partially fills the binding site (27) and C8 is shown with citrate bound at the opening of the calyx. The binding site of NGAL is slightly wider than that of C8, while C8's binding pocket is deeper. Figure generated by the program GRASP (31).

completing the barrel (Figure 2). The structure contains a short 310 helix at the N-terminus, a second 310 helix that packs across a conserved tryptophan (W31) at the closed end of the barrel, and an R-helix that flanks the calyx. Loop 1, which restricts access to the binding site in some lipocalins, is disordered and presumably exhibits considerable conformational variation. Cys40, which forms the disulfide bond to C8R, is located in this loop. Compared to other lipocalins whose structures are known, C8 is most structurally similar to human NGAL (PDB entry 1QQS) (27). Superposition of the NGAL and C8 secondary structures yields a match rate of 74.7% and an rms deviation between CR atoms of 1.35 Å for matching residues (28). Interestingly, C8 shares only 19.4% sequence identity with NGAL. The well-characterized human retinol binding protein RBP shares a higher sequence identity (27.8%) but superimposes on C8 with a structural similarity match rate of only 69.3% (rms ) 1.45 Å) (PDB entry 1FEM) (29, 30). Such disparity between sequence identity and structural similarity is common among lipocalins.

The backbone of NGAL superimposes well on C8 with the most deviation occurring in the loop regions at the opening of the calyx (Figure 3). The C8 calyx is quite similar to that of NGAL as it is fairly wide with hydrophilic, positively charged residues near the opening (Figure 4). However, it is much deeper than that of NGAL. The apparent base of NGAL's binding pocket is formed by residues F83, Y138, F123, and Y56, which fill the deepest portion of the calyx. In C8, the corresponding residues are Y83, Y131, L120, and V57. The smaller side chains of L120 and V57 create a hydrophobic cavity at the bottom of the calyx with an opening of sufficient size to allow penetration of a single hydrocarbon chain. Experimental evidence indicates the cavity itself could accommodate a larger moiety. Strong density corresponding to two Xe atoms, and a third weaker peak, was observed within this pocket (data not shown). The relatively large Xe atom has been used as a probe to study cavities and hydrophobic sites in several proteins (32). Such regions are usually devoid of ordered water molecules and normally

FIGURE 5: Molscript rendering of C8 showing the residues lining the hydrophobic (blue) and hydrophilic (red) portions of the binding pocket. Left: Side view of the C8 calyx. Right: View looking directly into the mouth of the calyx. Residues lining the bottom of the calyx are F22, A24, F27, W31, M64, F92, V107, T110, A116, and L118. Residues lining the middle portion of the calyx are L33, L55, V57, V66, T68, Q81, Y83, L94, V103, V105, L120, S127, K129, and Y131.

FIGURE 6: Side view of the middle portion of the binding pocket in C8. Y83 and Y131 appear to form a gate to the deep hydrophobic region of the calyx. Above the gate and out of view is the positively charged entrance to the calyx, while a portion of the hydrophobic pocket can be seen below the gate. Also out of view are residues L120 and V57, which by virtue of their smaller side chains provide space for ligand access to this lower pocket. The tyrosine hydroxyls are hydrogen-bonded to four water molecules to form a hexagonal arrangement that separates the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portion of the binding pocket. This suggests the natural ligand possesses some hydrogen bond acceptors adjacent to the hydrophobic portion of its structure.

accommodate a single Xe atom. In agreement with these generalizations, the deepest portion of the C8 calyx is hydrophobic and devoid of ordered water, yet it is much larger (with a volume of about 100 Å3) than a typical protein cavity (Figure 5). The side chains of Y83 and Y131 appear to partially restrict access to the bottom portion of the calyx and may act as a gate (Figure 6). If indeed a moiety larger than a single hydrocarbon chain enters the bottom portion

of the calyx, conformational changes in these residues would be necessary to provide access. Citrate Binding. Well-resolved density corresponding to a citrate ion from the crystallization buffer is observed within hydrogen bonding distance from the -NH3+ group of K129 at the opening of the calyx (Figure 7). The citrate ion is anchored by this lysine and stabilized through additional hydrogen bonds to the guanidinium group of R70 and three water molecules. Within the vicinity of the citrate ion and ringing the entrance to the calyx are several positively charged residues, namely, R41, R49, R70, R100, and R122. This suggests that the natural ligand for C8 contains anionic moieties such as carboxylate or phosphate groups at one end. Interestingly, no citrate ion binding was observed at pH 7.0 where the ion has an overall charge of -3 as compared to -2 at pH 4.0. Binding of the C8R Indel Peptide. Crystals soaked with a synthetic peptide containing sequence found at the putative C8 binding site in C8R exhibited additional electron density corresponding to three amino acid residues (data not shown). The location of this density was near loop 1 and overlapped with the citrate ion binding site in the native structure. This peptide contains three negatively charged aspartic residues, two of which are adjacent to each other and could possibly be involved in binding to positively charged residues near the opening of the calyx. However, the overall quality of the diffraction data was only moderate, and these residues could not be fitted to the electron density with certainty. Additionally, loop 1 maintained its disordered state, and thus no information on the conformation of loop 1 in the peptideC8 complex could be extracted from the data. DISCUSSION This report describes the first three-dimensional structure of a protein component of the MAC. C8 displays a typical lipocalin fold, thus confirming predictions based on its amino acid sequence and genomic structure. Its structure is most similar to human NGAL, a lipocalin released from granules

K129 coordinates two carboxylase groups of the citrate ion, while R70 and three water molecules are also within hydrogen bonding distance from the ion.

of activated neutrophils (33, 34). Although the function of NGAL is unknown, it is thought to have a role in modulating the inflammatory response by binding and neutralizing bacterial products or other proinflammatory small molecules released at the site of an infection. C8 is structurally similar to NGAL in that it forms a calyx with a relatively large hydrophilic entry that carries an overall positive charge. However, unlike NGAL, C8 has a deep hydrophobic cavity that is accessible through a somewhat constricted, hydrophilic portion of the binding pocket. This suggests the C8 ligand is longer and thinner than the NGAL ligand. The functional significance of the ligand binding site in C8 is unclear. It was originally proposed that such a site may mediate binding to C8R. When the MAC assembles on target cells, C8R inserts into the membrane bilayer (5); therefore, it must contain one or more hydrophobic regions with the potential to bind lipid. It was suggested that C8 may bind to such a region and shield C8R from premature membrane interactions, either during biosynthetic processing or while in the circulation (35). Subsequent studies showed that C8R can be produced independently as a recombinant protein; therefore, such a role for C8 is now considered less likely (16). Results from the present study support this conclusion. The binding pocket in C8 is much wider and deeper than necessary to accommodate a single amino acid side chain as the ligand. The mouth of the calyx is sufficiently wide to accommodate multiple side chains associated with a loop; however, little penetration into the calyx interior could occur. Thus, it seems unlikely the ligand binding site serves as the principal mediator of C8R binding. The site of interaction with C8R most likely resides in or near loop 1, which is relatively large and contains Cys40. During intracellular processing, C8R and C8 must associate prior to formation of the disulfide bond in C8R-; therefore, they must contain complementary binding sites for each other. This is supported by in vitro studies using purified C8R and C8 (7). In C8R, the binding site for C8 has been localized to a unique 17-residue insertion (indel) at position

159-175 (26). This segment includes Cys164 that forms the disulfide bond to Cys40 in C8. Importantly, a synthetic peptide containing this sequence was coupled to agarose and shown to specifically bind C8. In the present study, crystals soaked with this peptide revealed additional electron density near loop 1, thus supporting the prediction that this region of C8 is involved in binding C8R. Loop 1 is disordered at both low and neutral pH as well as in the presence of the indel peptide, which suggests conformational flexibility in this region. It may be that during assembly of the MAC, conformational changes in C8R influence the position of loop 1 and this in turn controls access to the ligand binding site. At the present time, one can only speculate on the identity of the natural ligand for C8. Crystallographic analyses revealed no associated ligand other than a citrate ion from the crystallization buffer. Mass spectral analysis likewise revealed no endogenous ligand bound to purified recombinant C8.2 Several lipocalins are capable of binding retinoids; however, in most cases binding is nonspecific, and the functional significance is not obvious (36). Binding of radiolabeled retinol and retinoic acid to C8R- has been reported, and it was suggested that C8 is a retinol transport protein (37). However, these results could not be corroborated in studies using purified C8 and spectroscopic methods to detect retinol binding (16). Analysis of the C8 structure superimposed on that of a RBP-retinoic acid complex supports the latter findings. The overall shape, size, and charge of the binding pocket is not conducive to retinoid binding. The binding pocket in C8 is nearly twice as wide at the mouth of the calyx than that of RBP (18 vs 9 Å). A major contribution to the widening of the calyx can be attributed to the observation that C8 contains an extra -strand (residues V176-D178) that serves to enlarge the diameter of the calyx. Additionally, a shift in -strands A and H in C8 away from the center of the calyx further widens the binding pocket. Thus, C8 lacks the ability

7036 Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 22, 2002 to make sufficient hydrophobic contacts with much of the aliphatic chain of retinoic acid. There is also a major difference in the loop structures. Loop 1 in RBP is smaller and extends across the mouth of the calyx to stabilize retinoic acid. The corresponding loop in C8 is partially disordered; however, it appears to protrude away from the center of the calyx. Loop 3 in RBP is much longer and along with loop 5 is shifted toward the center of the calyx to further stabilize bound retinoic acid. Residues lining the binding pockets of these proteins are also significantly different (30). The hydrophobic residues responsible for stabilizing the bulky, hydrophobic six-membered ring of retinoic acid in RBP (F97 and F137) are replaced by the more hydrophilic residues Y83 and Y131 in C8. Also, the upper portion of the pocket in C8 is hydrophilic and carries an overall positive charge, whereas the binding cavity in RBP is somewhat hydrophilic but remains essentially neutral. The characteristics of the binding pocket are suggestive of a fatty acid or related compound as the ligand for C8. The depth and shape can accommodate an elongated hydrophobic structure such as the aliphatic portion of a fatty acid with a chain length up to C12. The contour of the pocket is also compatible with a single monounsaturated fatty acid. Positively charged residues around the opening of the calyx suggest the ligand has negative charge(s) at one end. One obvious source of a fatty acid-related ligand is the membrane upon which the MAC is formed, e.g., glycerophospholipid from mammalian membranes or lipid A from the lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria. Exposure of membrane lipid during assembly of the MAC may render fatty acid side chains accessible to C8. Such a binding function has not been considered previously because C8 was thought to be located on the periphery of the MAC and away from the membrane (5, 7). Moreover, C8 is not required for MAC-mediated lysis of membranes. A complex of C8R and C8 is an effective substitute for C8 in lysing simple cells such as erythrocytes (16, 38) and in killing gramnegative bacteria.2 However, the activity of this complex is lower relative to C8, which indicates that C8 functions in some manner to enhance MAC activity. The results here suggest binding of C8 to membrane-associated fatty acids may be one mechanism by which this occurs. Without a clear understanding of its role in the complement system, it is difficult to speculate on the identity of a soluble ligand for C8. The MAC deposits on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria; therefore, C8 is exposed to a variety of inflammatory mediators produced at the site of an infection. One intriguing possibility is that it binds to a small hydrophobic mediator and modulates the local inflammatory response as suggested for NGAL. An alternative possibility is that C8 transports an as yet unidentified ligand in the circulation. Experiments investigating both these possibilities and the potential for C8 to bind to membraneassociated lipids are in progress. REFERENCES
