Like all Rho (Ras homology) GTPases, RhoA functions as a molecular switch in cell signaling, alternating between GTPand GDP-bound states, with its biologically inactive GDP-bound form maintained as a cytosolic complex with RhoGDI (guanine nucleotide-exchange inhibitor). The crystal structures of RhoA±GDP and of the C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of RhoGDI (residues 67±203) are known, but the mechanism by which the two proteins interact is not known. The functional human RhoA± RhoGDI complex has been expressed in yeast and crystalÊ lized (P6522, unit-cell parameters a = b = 139, c = 253 A, two complexes in the asymmetric unit). Although diffraction from Ê these crystals extends to 3.5 A and is highly anisotropic, the experimentally phased (MAD plus MIR) electron-density map was adequate to reveal the mutual disposition of the two molecules. The result was validated by molecular-replacement calculations when data were corrected for anisotropy. Furthermore, the N-terminus of RhoGDI (the region involved in inhibition of nucleotide exchange) can be identi®ed in the electron-density map: it is bound to the switch I and switch II regions of RhoA, occluding an epitope which binds Dbl-like nucleotide-exchange factors. The entrance of the hydrophobic Ê pocket of RhoGDI is 25 A from the last residue in the RhoA model, with its C-terminus oriented to accommodate the geranylgeranyl group without conformational change in RhoA.

1. Introduction
RhoA, a member of the Ras-homology family of regulatory cytosolic GTPases, plays major roles in multiple cellular processes, including organization of the cytoskeleton (Mackay & Hall, 1998; Narumiya et al., 1997), cytokinesis (Narumiya, 1996), organogenesis (Wissmann et al., 1997), tumor invasiveness (Itoh et al., 1999; Yoshioka et al., 1998), neurite retraction and growth-cone organization (Jalink et al., 1994; Luo et al., 1997), exocytosis (Mariot et al., 1996; Norman et al., 1996), smooth muscle contraction and, through this mechanism, hypertension (Gong et al., 1996; Uehata et al., 1997). RhoA assumes the biologically active conformation upon binding of GTP and reverts to an inactive state when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. This cycle is regulated by accessory proteins, such as GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins), which dramatically enhance the rate of GTP hydrolysis (Gamblin & Smerdon, 1998; Scheffzek, Ahmadian & Wittinghofer, 1998), and GEFs (guanine nucleotide-exchange factors), which catalyze the exchange of GDP with GTP (Pan & Wessling-Resnick, 1998).

activation of effectors of RhoA are accompanied by (and probably require) its association with the plasma membrane through the prenylated RhoA C-terminus (Bokoch et al., 1994; Fujihara et al., 1997; Gong et al., 1996; Gong, Fujihara, Somlyo et al., 1997; Gong, Fujihara, Walker et al., 1997; Nomanbhoy & Cerione, 1996). Most of RhoA present in resting cells is complexed with the guanine nucleotide-exchange inhibitor RhoGDI (Fukumoto et al., 1990; Bourmeyster et al., 1992). Translocation to the membrane and possibly nucleotide exchange are dependent on the dissociation of RhoA from RhoGDI. Of the three isoforms of RhoGDI identi®ed to date, RhoGDIa, henceforth referred to simply as RhoGDI, is expressed ubiquitously and interacts with all three key Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Cdc42Hs and Rac (Adra et al., 1998; Sasaki & Takai, 1998). Structural studies have only recently begun to unravel some of the complex details of Rho-mediated cell regulation (Sprang, 1997). RhoA has been studied by X-ray crystallography in complex with GDP (Wei et al., 1997) and with bound GTPS (Ihara et al., 1998). Cdc42Hs has been characterized by NMR (Feltham et al., 1997) in both the active and inactive conformations. A structure of Rac in the active conformation was determined by X-ray crystallography (Hirshberg et al., 1997). The details of the mechanism by which Rho-speci®c GAPs enhance the rate of GTP hydrolysis were inferred from crystallographic studies (Barrett et al., 1997; Nassar et al., 1998; Rittinger, Walker, Eccleston, Nurmahomed et al., 1997; Rittinger, Walker, Eccleston, Smerdon et al., 1997; Scheffzek, Ahmadian, Weismuller et al., 1998). The mechanistic aspects of the interactions of Rho GTPases with their GEFs and RhoGDI are not well understood. Rho-speci®c GEFs typically contain a Dbl-like domain in tandem with a PH domain. The structure of such a two-domain fragment from the human SOS protein has been reported (Soisson et al., 1998), but its mechanism is unclear. RhoGDI has been studied in its native form only, both by crystallography and NMR (Gosser et al., 1997; Keep et al., 1997). It is a 204-residue protein which is only partly folded in the absence of the GTPase. The globular domain, amino acids 69±203, has a structure reminiscent of the immunoglobulin fold (Gosser et al., 1997; Keep et al., 1997). The ÁN59 variant of the protein binds well to the GTPase with an almost unaffected af®nity, but does not inhibit nucleotide-exchange properties. Consequently, the inhibitory function resides in the N-terminus. In this paper, we report an X-ray diffraction study of crystals of the human RhoA±RhoGDI complex obtained by co-expression of the two full-length proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These crystals diffract X-rays poorly, with signi®cant anisotropy, and do not allow for the re®nement of an atomic model. Nonetheless, the experimentally Ê phased (MAD plus MIR) electron-density map at 5 A clearly reveals the mutual disposition of RhoA±GDP and RhoGDI in the complex and suggests a mechanism by which the N-terminal fragment of RhoGDI ful®lls its biological role.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of recombinant samples for crystallization

To enhance the chances of obtaining well diffracting crystals, we prepared samples of complexes of N-terminally tagged and untagged proteins. Tagged human RhoA and RhoGDI, both full length, were co-expressed in yeast strain SY1 (Nakamoto et al., 1991) transformed with multicopy 2" plasmids carrying the cDNA under control of the inducible GAL1 promoter. The open reading frames were modi®ed with either a His6 or FLAG af®nity tag at the amino termini. Approximately half of the FLAG-tagged RhoA protein was found to be membrane associated, indicating that it was properly modi®ed by addition of geranylgeranyl at the cysteine in the carboxyl-terminal sequence CLVL. The other half of the FLAG-tagged RhoA was found in the cytosolic fraction, most of which was in complex with (His)6-tagged RhoGDI. The FLAG±RhoA/(His)6±RhoGDI complex which was used to grow crystals was puri®ed directly from the cytosolic fraction by sequential passage over a Talon metal-af®nity column (Clonetech) followed by an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody column (Kodak). The heterodimer was very stable, eluting as a single peak from an anion-exchange column as well as from a Superdex 75 (Pharmacia) gel-®ltration column. Yields of 4±5 mg from 18 l of culture were regularly obtained. The ®nal protein sample was concentrated to 10±15 mg mlÀ1 using an Amicon 10 centrifuge concentrator. The untagged samples were obtained using N-terminally tagged (His6)RhoA expressed in sf9 cells using the pFastBac system (Life Technologies), solubilized by the addition of 90% pure E. coli expressed RhoGDI, either in its full-length form or with the N-terminal 22 residues truncated (Shef®eld et al., 1999). However, this approach did not yield crystals.
2.2. Enzymatic assays

Protein-associated nucleotides were quantitated by separation over a Waters HPLC SAX column, and elution followed at 254 nm with integration of the peaks compared with standards (Gong et al., 1996). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The stability of bound GDP in the FLAG±RhoA/(His6)±RhoGDI complex was determined by incubation of 0.1 mM puri®ed complex in 0.1 M Tris±HCl, 0.1 M NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2 pH 8.0 at 295 K. At selected times, 20 ml samples were diluted 20fold and then concentrated to remove any released nucleotide. The protein concentration of the samples were determined, the protein was precipitated with 1% perchloric acid and the concentration of GDP remaining in the supernatant was determined by HPLC.
2.3. Crystallization and preparation of derivatives

Crystals were obtained regardless of the order of the af®nity tags. Data reported here are for the FLAG±RhoA±His6± RhoGDI crystals. The largest crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in sitting drops using equal volumes of protein (15 mg mlÀ1 in 25 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM

The phases were eventually determined by a combination of multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) and multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) techMgCl2) and reservoir solution [51% saturated (NH4)2SO4, niques.

The three-wavelength MAD experiment was conducted on an ADSC 2 Â 2 CCD detector using beamline X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the HKL suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Unless speci®ed otherwise, subsequent calculations utilized programs implemented in the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) or the X-PLOR and CNS suites (Brunger et al., 1998). Intensities were converted to structure-factor magnitudes using TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994), which also calculated the fall-off in the structure-factor magnitudes for orthogonal directions.

non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) and indicated a solvent content of 66%. The local dyad nearly coincides with the crystallographic twofold screw axis, which explains why the self-rotation function failed to detect non-crystallographic symmetry. Subsequently, a native Patterson map revealed a translational peak expected from the nearly parallel orientations of the crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry axes. The MAD phases were used to detect four metal sites in the Hg derivative (Table 2; Fig. 2). The metal substructure had a twofold symmetry consistent with the MAD-phased electrondensity map. Another set of phases (MIRAS) was then

calculated based on isomorphous and anomalous differences, using the Ho3+ (edge) and the Hg data sets. The choice of Ho3+ (edge) over Ho3+ (peak) was dictated by the higher I/'(I) ratio in the former data set, which was expected to yield better estimates of isomorphous differences. Combination of the MIRAS and MAD phases, using SIGMAA followed by DM (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994), produced an electron-density map which was used in the RAVE program suite (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994) to calculate the correlation about the non-crystallographic dyad in the electron-density map and also in the calculation of molecular Ê envelopes. The ®nal experimentally phased 5 A resolution map utilized phases calculated in DM with NCS averaging (Table 3; Fig. 3). This map con®rmed the location of the RhoA model and allowed the positioning of the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI. The mutual disposition of the two proteins RhoA (residues 4±180) and RhoGDI (residues 68±203) was further re®ned by rigid-body re®nement in real space, using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The residual electron-density map, used to visualize the putative conformations of the N-terminus of RhoGDI and of the C-terminus of RhoA, was prepared by subtracting a map extracted from within a mask covering the coordinates of the nucleotide-free RhoA and RhoGDI molecules from a map extracted using the mask used for NCS averaging.
2.6. Molecular replacement

The positioning of the RhoA molecules in the crystal was facilitated by the easily interpretable con®guration of the helices and was further validated by the chemistry of the Ho3+ and Hg2+ derivatives. However, no such validation was at hand for RhoGDI, which being a -barrel is not easily interpretable Ê at 5.0 A resolution and which contained no heavy-atom binding sites. In an effort to independently validate the orientation of RhoGDI, using intensity data as opposed to experimental phases, we resorted to MR calculations using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994; Table 4). A rotational search with the full model was performed using all Ê re¯ections between 10 and 5.0 A, the range of data which yielded the highest signal for the top solution. All solutions output from the rotational search were fed into the translational search, which Ê utilized data between 20 and 4.5 A, and the top solution for each orientation was subjected to rigid-body re®nement Ê against data between 15 and 4.5 A. A similar procedure was performed for the calculations with the individual components of the structure. To reconstruct the model of the complex from its individual Figure 2 protein components, calculations were Difference Fourier map showing the peaks corresponding to the Hg sites.

temperature-factor (B) correction to the native data was evaluated using X-PLOR and the optimal non-zero values for the tensor elements were B11 = À86.4, B22 = À86.4, B33 = À1.1 and B12 = À65.2. As already pointed out, none of the two individual models produced interpretable solutions. However, a dimer of RhoA constructed in accordance with the experimental electrondensity map gave a clear solution, which was visibly enhanced when data were corrected for anisotropy. With the two RhoA molecules ®xed and using the data corrected for anisotropy, the ®rst RhoGDI molecule was successfully positioned, followed by the second one. In both cases, the correct solution had the highest correlation coef®cient and lowest conventional R factor.
2.7. Miscellaneous calculations

The secondary structure of the Nterminal fragment of RhoGDI was predicted using PredictProtein (http:// www.embl-heidelberg.de/services/sander/ predictprotein/). Surface-area calculations and representations were calculated using the program GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). Ribbon diagrams and ®gures containing electron density were produced with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997).

The ®nal protein preparation was very pure and appeared on a silver-stained gel as two bands of approximately equal density corresponding to RhoA and RhoGDI (Fig. 4a). We established that this tagged complex was indeed functionally representative of the wild-type cytosolic species. The association of RhoGDI with RhoA requires posttranslational geranylgeranylation at the carboxyl terminus of RhoA and removal of the last three residues (Hori et al., 1991). Translocation to and association with the cellular membrane is also dependent upon prenylation. Consequently, the facts that coexpressed human RhoA and RhoGDI formed a heterodimeric complex in vivo and that excess RhoA was associated with the membrane fraction provided good evidence that the human RhoA was prenylated in yeast. The biological functionality of the yeast-produced human RhoA was assessed by its Ca2+-sensitizing effect on the force developed by

When we replaced GDP with GTP at low concentrations of Mg2+, the hydrolysis rate of the bound GTP in the complex was signi®cantly slower when compared with the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA (Fig. 4b), as expected from earlier reports (Chuang et al., 1993; Hancock & Hall, 1993; Hart et al., 1992). The t1/2 of hydrolysis of the initial amount of bound GTP was 4.5 h at 295 K, whereas free RhoA hydrolyzes GTP with a t1/2 of 18 min (Self & Hall, 1995). The complex with the af®nity tags exchanged [i.e. (His)6±RhoA/FLAG±RhoGDI] had similar characteristics, indicating that the af®nity tags on the individual components of the Rho±RhoGDI complex do not affect the functionality of the heterodimer.

helices of RhoA were readily recognizable in the electron density and were related by an obvious non-crystallographic dyad (Fig. 3). When the protein moiety of RhoA was thus placed, it was found that the positions of the two Ho3+ sites identi®ed by Patterson methods coincided with the expected Mg2+. Difference density for these Ho3+ sites is returned using model phases, lending further credibility to the model (Fig. 3c). There is also signi®cant positive density which can easily be interpreted as the bound GDP nucleotide. Finally, the four major Hg2+ sites located by difference Fourier using the MAD phases were located in the immediate proximity of the free sulfhydryls of Cys16 and Cys107 in each of the two RhoA molecules (Fig. 2). Although a single RhoA molecule does not yield a solution in AMoRe, a dimer of two RhoA molecules, as observed in the experimentally phased map, gives a clear solution. The two RhoGDI molecules can be positioned independently using AMoRe, and the result is very close to the manual docking into the experimental density. In fact, the root-mean-square difference calculated using all the atoms between the manually constructed complex re®ned by real-space methods against the experimentally phased map and the one generated Ê by MR was only 1.15 A for all atoms. Meaningful re®nement of atomic coordinates is not feasible at the resoÊ lution limit of 4.0±5.0 A, but nevertheless attempts to re®ne the two components of the complex yielded improved agreement statistics. Torsionangle dynamics with the maximumlikelihood target function in CNS improved the conventional R factor from 51 to 41% (free R factor from 51 to 47%) using data greater than 3' Ê between 8 and 4.0 A. However, electron-density maps calculated with coef®cients derived from the model Ê re®ned at 4.0 A showed little improvement over the experimentally phased map; these were suspected to have strong model bias and were not used. We conclude that the mutual disposition of the two molecules in the complex has been accurately determined. However, the resulting coordinates of the complex obtained by docking of the existing models do not re¯ect any local changes which might have occurred in either RhoA or RhoGDI in response to the formation of the heterodimer.

3.3. Binding of the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI to RhoA

The crystallographic model of the RhoA±RhoGDI complex obtained by the docking of the models of RhoA±GDP (residues 4±180) and of the C-terminal domain of Rho±GDI (68±203) into an experimentally phased electron-density map provides the ®rst insight into the nature of the interactions between the two proteins. The complex forms an elongated Ê structure with a long axis of approximately 77 A from the insert helix of RhoA, which is distal to the RhoGDI binding

site, to the C-terminus of RhoGDI (Fig. 6). The GTPasebinding epitope of RhoGDI includes primarily residues in the D±E and F±G loops (nomenclature according to Gosser et al., 1997) which join the respective -strands in the immunoÊ globulin-like fold. Residues within 5 A of RhoA include Glu121, Ile122, Ser124 and Gly125 in the D±E loop, as well as Met145, Gly147, Ser148 and Gly150 in the F±G loop. In Ê addition, Asp184, which is in the H±I loop, is also within 5 A of RhoA. This epitope, conserved in the RhoGDI family, is consistent with earlier NMR experiments using non-prenylated Cdc42Hs±GDP and 15N RhoGDI (Gosser et al., 1997). Our study reveals for the ®rst time the epitope on RhoA which binds to the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI; it includes

residues at the base of the switch II region and in the neighboring helix 3. The amino acids of RhoA which are within Ê 5 A of RhoGDI in the model are the switch II residues Arg68, Leu69, Pro71, Leu72 and Pro75, and residues His105, Phe106 and Pro108 from helix 3. With the exception of Phe106, replaced by His in Rac and Cdc42Hs, all these residues are conserved throughout the Rho family, but are not found in the Ras GTPases. Lack of highly re®ned coordinates precludes a detailed characterization of the contacts between speci®c amino acids, but the model does allow for the identi®cation of some potentially important interactions. A hydrophobic cluster is formed between Ile122 of RhoGDI and the RhoA residues Leu69 and Leu72. A hydrophobic interaction may also exist between Met145 of RhoGDI and Pro108 of RhoA. The side chain of Phe106 from RhoA packs against Gly125 and Gly147 in RhoGDI, which form a groove on the surface of the molecule. Finally, Asp184 of RhoGDI and His105 of RhoA are close enough in the model to suggest a possible hydrogen bond. Given the high af®nity of Rho and RhoGDI proteins for one another [the representative Cdc42Hs±GDI interaction has an apparent Kd value of 30 nM (Nomanbhoy & Cerione, 1996)] the area of contact between the molecules in the Ê complex is relatively small, being 413 A2 in each of the proteins. This implies that the contribution of this contact to the overall binding energy is relatively small. The critical contribution is more likely to originate from the binding of the geranylgeranyl moiety within the hydrophobic cavity of the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI. Indeed, non-prenylated RhoA is not bound by RhoGDI (Hori et al., 1991), while a replacement of Ile by Asp at position 177 in RhoGDI, an amino acid located at the entrance of the lipid-binding cavity and away from the GTPase, reduces the af®nity of Cdc42Hs for RhoGDI by a factor of 20 (Platko et al., 1995). In the crystal structure of the complex, the distance from the C-terminus of RhoA to the entrance of the hydrophobic Ê pocket of RhoGDI is approximately 25 A. The entrance to the pocket faces the C-terminal helix in RhoA in such a way that no conformational changes are required to dock the lipid to RhoGDI. Ten residues are missing from the C-terminus of the RhoA model, and in the complex they probably continue as a helix for one more turn and then assume an extended conformation. This is corroborated by the residual electrondensity map, which shows an extension of positive density from the C-terminal helix of RhoA directly towards the opening to the pocket in RhoGDI. A difference electrondensity map calculated with the coef®cients Fobs À Fcalc and experimental phases (data not shown) reveals signi®cant positive density inside the pocket, consistent with a bound geranylgeranyl group.
3.4. Binding of the N-terminal oligopeptide of RhoGDI to the GTPase

Perhaps the most important question with respect to the structure of RhoGDI is the conformation of its N-terminal oligopeptide, residues 1±63, in the complex with RhoA. Residues 1±22 are not required for the biological functions of RhoGDI and are probably disordered (Platko et al., 1995), while residues 23±59, which are required for the inhibition of nucleotide dissociation/exchange and extraction of the GTPase from membrane, are also disordered in the native molecule but not in the complex (Gosser et al., 1997; Keep et al., 1997). The experimental electron-density map of the complex contains additional positive density to that corresponding to the RhoA and the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI. To better visualize these features, we subtracted the density associated with the protein moieties from the density of the intact complex. We refer to the density map obtained in this way as residual density. Fig. 7 shows the result of this calculation. A long stretch of continuous density wraps around the RhoA molecule and connects with the N-terminus of the RhoGDI molecule. This density begins adjacent to RhoA at the end of helix 3 by residues Glu102 and Lys104 and extends across to the helical switch II region over Pro71. The density then makes a sharp turn, assumes a cylindrical shape and runs adjacent to the switch II helix over Arg68 and Tyr66. A sharp turn follows, and a second cylindrical fragment runs in close proximity to Thr37 in the switch I region, over Val38 and Glu40 and adjacent to the side chain of Asn41 before turning toward the Cterminal domain of RhoGDI. Fig. 8 shows a model for residues 24±68 in RhoGDI based on the residual density. It Figure 7 contains a stretch of extended chain, two short Residual density corresponding to the N-terminus of RhoGDI. A stereoview of the helices connected by a short linker and a loop residual electron density is contoured at a level corresponding to 1' of the original map shown in Fig. 3. The model is rotated about the vertical axis relative to Fig. 6. which connects this fragment with the NActa Cryst. (1999). D55, 1503±1515 Longenecker et al.

terminus of the immunoglobulin-like domain. It is interesting that in the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI (Keep et al., 1997), the second copy of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit adopts the conformation for residues 60±68 which follows the electron density observed here in the complex. Secondary-structure prediction supports the model, as the two fragments in the N-terminal oligopeptide between residues 32±41 and 46±55 have strong helical propensities. These fragments agree with respect to the lengths and positions along the polypeptide chains of the helices inferred from the electron-density map (Fig. 9). The putative four-residue linker would also appear to be of appropriate length to connect the helices. Thus, in summary, the model suggests that upon binding to the Rho GTPase, residues 23±59 become ordered and fold into an extended structure followed by two -helices. None of these fragments makes any contact with each other or with the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI. Therefore, in the absence of the GTPase, their mutual disposition is no longer stable. Whether the helices remain intact in free RhoGDI is not clear, since HSQC spectra reported in the literature (Gosser et al., 1997; Keep et al., 1997) are unlikely to differentiate between a free-¯oating helix and a completely extended structure. the 4-helix of one RhoA molecule and the 5-helix of the other. Although the detailed interactions cannot be elucidated with the present data, the residues from helix 4 which are likely to participate in this interaction are Glu142, Arg145, Asp146 and Asn149. Similarly, those residues from helix 5 which are likely to be important for the NCS interaction include Glu169, Glu172, Met173 and Arg176. Side chains of residues from the 6-strand which would contribute to the interacting surface are Phe154, Tyr156, Met157 and Glu158. Although this packing results in a dimerization of complexes, such dimerization is not known to be biologically relevant.
3.6. Cytophysiological implications

RhoGDI has been reported to have three functions. It inhibits the nucleotide exchange catalyzed by guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), decreases the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by the GTPase and extracts the Rho GTPase from the membrane. Earlier structural studies of RhoGDI (Gosser et al., 1997; Keep et al., 1997) revealed the tertiary structure of its C-terminal domain and suggested the mechanism by which the geranylgeranyl group of the GTPase is bound, but could not rationalize its other functional properties. The present crystallographic analysis sheds considerable light on the structure±function relationships which 3.5. Dimerization of complexes govern the Rho±RhoGDI interactions. Upon formation of the complex with the GTPase, the The asymmetric unit contains two complexes related by the N-terminal fragment of RhoGDI (23±59) wraps around a NCS twofold axis. This crystal packing brings the two RhoA surface epitope on RhoA which includes fragments of the molecules into close proximity, whereas the RhoGDI moleswitch I and switch II regions. In particular, it comes into close cules make contact exclusively with molecules related by contact with Thr37, a residue which plays a key role in the crystallographic symmetry. The RhoA molecules interact nucleotide-exchange mechanism catalyzed by Rho-speci®c, across the surface formed by 4- and 5-helices, with the 6Dbl-like GEFs (Li & Zheng, 1997). The RhoA±GDP crystal strand sandwiched between them. The intermolecular packing structure (Wei et al., 1997) showed that, in contrast to Ras, appears to be dominated by electrostatic interactions between Thr37 in RhoA is directly involved in the coordination of Mg2+ through the main-chain carbonyl group. When Thr37 of RhoA or the corresponding Thr35 in Cdc42Hs is mutated to an Ala, there is complete loss of sensitivity to GEFs in the GTPases (Li & Zheng, 1997). In Ras, an analogous mutation of Thr35 to Ala produces only about a threefold reduction in sensitivity to Cdc25, a Ras-speci®c GEF (Mistou et al., 1992). It can therefore be assumed that Dbl-like GEFs operate by a mechanism which involves the disruption of the interaction between the carbonyl of Thr37 and Mg2+, leading to the dissociation of Mg2+ and concomitant loss of GDP. RhoGDI inhibits this function by shielding the side chain of Thr37 in its complex with Rho GTPases. In order for RhoGDI to act on diverse Rhofamily members, the epitope responsible for the binding of the inhibitory N-terminal fragment of RhoGDI ought to be conserved among the Figure 8 GTPases. Fig. 10 shows the sequence conservaModel of the complex with the N-terminal fragment of RhoGDI. A model which follows tion for RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, Rac2 and the residual density is highlighted in orange and is shown from the same view as in Fig. 7.

Cdc42Hs. It is evident that the surface of RhoA covered by the N-terminal fragment of RhoGDI consists almost exclusively of very highly conserved amino acids. A similar analysis of the sequences for the RhoGDI family is not possible because of the uncertainty in the exact orientation of speci®c residues in RhoGDI with respect to the GTPase. We note, however, that the hydrophobic faces of the helices, which are most likely to interact with the GTPases, are largely conserved (Fig. 9) and the small variations in sequences could potentially account for the differences in af®nity between the various isoforms of RhoGDI for Rho GTPases. The inhibition of the intrinsic RhoA GTPase activity by RhoGDI is more dif®cult to explain, and a structure of the complex involving a GTP analogue bound to Rho will be required to address this question in detail. However, the present study suggests that the N-terminal fragment of RhoGDI is likely to stabilize the conformations of the switch I and switch II residues and thereby confer additional stability on the Rho±GTP complex. It is also necessary to address the mechanism by which RhoGDI solubilizes Rho. The truncated, Á59 mutant of RhoGDI fails to extract Cdc42Hs from the membranes (Gosser et al., 1997), indicating that the binding of the geranylgeranyl group by RhoGDI is not suf®cient for its extraction from the membrane. The N-terminal fragment may interact with the GTPase ®rst and may reorient the protein in such a way that the geranylgeranyl group becomes accessible to RhoGDI. Such a mechanism agrees with the recently proposed two-step kinetics by which RhoGDI extracts Cdc42Hs from the membrane (Nomanbhoy et al., 1999). There are some inconsistencies between the molecular model of the Rho±RhoGDI complex inferred from our investigation and earlier studies which probed the nature of the interactions between the two proteins. The native RhoA± RhoGDI complex obtained from rabbit ileum cytosol cannot be immunoprecipitated using antibodies raised against the insert helix of RhoA (Fujihara et al., 1997). However, following additional chromatographic puri®cation, native partially puri®ed RhoA±RhoGDI complex, as well as the recombinant yeast-produced complex, could be immunoprecipitated with the same antibody (data not shown). The combination of this ®nding with the proposed structure of the complex, which shows that the insert helix is distal to the RhoGDI binding site, suggests that the lack of immunoprecipitability of the crude native complex does not result from the shielding of the antibody-binding epitope by RhoGDI, but more likely from the presence of other as yet unidenti®ed protein(s) in the complex. Finally, the replacement of the insert helix in Cdc42Hs with the short link adapted from Ras implicated this helix in the inhibitory function of RhoGDI (Wu et al., 1997). This suggestion cannot be rationalized by the crystal structure and suggests secondary effects arising from the conformational changes in the modi®ed Cdc42Hs protein.

In conclusion, the proposed model of the recombinant RhoA±RhoGDI complex sheds new light on the mechanism by which RhoGDI carries out its biological functions and particularly the mechanism by which RhoGDI inhibits nucleotide exchange. Nonetheless, further work will be required to address the details of the interactions, elusive at the low resolution imposed by the crystals, and to reconcile the structure of the puri®ed complex with its behavior in cytosolic extracts.
