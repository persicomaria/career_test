ABSTRACT We present here three high-resolution crystal structures of complexes between the DNA-binding domain of the heat-shock transcription factor (HSF) and DNA oligomers. Although the DNA oligomers contain HSF's specific binding sequence, called a heat-shock element, the crystal structures do not contain the specific protein­DNA complex. In one crystal structure, the 10 base pair DNA oligomer is statically disordered. In the other two related structures, the 12 base pair DNA oligomers are in unique positions, but the protein­ DNA contacts in these two crystals are not sequence specific. In all three structures, the DNA appears to act as a rigid, polyanion scaffold to support columns of proteins in a crystalline lattice. A robust crystal packing interface between protein monomers obscures the true DNA-binding surface, known from previous genetic and biochemical studies. By redesigning the protein to interfere with the crystal lattice contacts, we were able to obtain physiologically relevant crystals in a specific protein­DNA complex. Thus, a crystal-packing interface was able to prevent the weak, but physiological relevant interactions between a protein and DNA. Proteins 2001;45:219 ­228. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: heat-shock transcription factor; nonspecific; static disorder; lattice contacts INTRODUCTION The heat-shock transcription factor (HSF) is a eukaryotic transcriptional activator that regulates the stress response in eukaryotes. In response to a wide range of stresses, HSF activates the transcription of the genes for the heat-shock proteins, a set of proteins that protect the cell from stress. HSF's function depends on binding to specific sequences of DNA, called heat-shock elements (HSEs), found near the promoters of the regulated genes. HSEs are made up of long inverted arrays of the basic repeat NGAAN.1,2 Two domains mediate binding of HSF to HSEs: a DNA-binding domain and a trimerization domain. Each DNA-binding domain is thought to recognize a single NGAAN repeat,3,4 while the trimerization domain provides the cooperativity that improves both the specificity and affinity of the HSF:HSE interaction. The minimal binding site for function in vivo consists of three repeats (NGAANNTTCNNGAAN),1,2 and this is likely related to the trimeric nature of HSF. However, HSF will

bind in vitro to two repeats in either a head-to-head orientation (NGAANNTTCN) or tail-to-tail orientation (NTTCNNGAAN) with lower affinity (Kd 40 nM) than to an HSE with three repeats (Kd 2 nM).5 The DNAbinding domain alone will bind specifically to HSEs albeit with a much lower affinity (Kd 5 mM) than a fragment also containing the trimerization domain.3,6 Previously, we had determined the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain from Kluyveromyces lactis HSF, using a fragment that contained amino acids 193 to 281, as well as three additional residues at the C-terminus, which had been added during the cloning process.7 The structure is similar to the "winged" helix-turn-helix family of DNAbinding proteins.8,9 The structural homology to other helix-turn-helix proteins, as well as the sequence conservation of helix 3 in all HSFs, strongly suggested that the third helix of the DNA-binding domain functions as the recognition helix. This was supported by a genetic analysis of the K. lactis DNA-binding domain,10 NMR titration studies on the Drosophila melanogaster HSF,11 and crosslinking studies between the K. lactis protein and DNA.12 In addition, there was a wealth of biochemical data on the regions of the DNA contacted by HSF. Ethylation interference and DNase I nicking interference revealed a set of phosphates in the phosphate backbones that are important for DNA binding,4 and methylation interference indicated that the DBD binds in the major groove of the DNA.13 In this paper, we describe our attempts to obtain a crystal structure of a specific complex between HSF's DNA-binding domain and an HSE. We used the same DNA-binding domain fragment from the apoprotein crystals and three different oligonucleotides, each containing a two-repeat HSE. The first structure, using a 10mer oligonucleotide in a head-to-head orientation (called 10mer),

resulted in a 2.5 Å structure where the DNA is statically disordered. The second structure, using a 12mer oligonucleotide in a head-to-head orientation (called HtH), resulted in a 2.1 Å structure that did not show the expected characteristics of site-specific DNA binding when compared to existing biochemical and genetic studies. To confirm this, a third structure was determined at 2.2 Å using a 12mer oligonucleotide with a tail-to-tail orientation (called TtT), which should have a different set of protein­DNA contacts than the head-to-head complex. Both 12mer structures had virtually identical contacts to the DNA, despite the fact that the DNA sequences differ with only two bases in common. Comparison of the 12mer structures to a recent structure of an engineered Cro monomer bound nonspecifically to its cognate sequence has led us to conclude that the contacts observed in these HSF-HSE crystals are not true "nonspecific" complexes. In all three structures, the largest packing interaction occurs between two proteins related by a 21 screw axis. This crystal packing interface obscures access to the putative recognition helix. Thus, the crystal packing interactions appear to have overcome the expected interactions between protein and the DNA. As proof of this, we were able to redesign the protein so as to avoid this particularly extensive lattice contact and then use this new DNAbinding domain fragment with a two-repeat HSE to obtain a sequence-specific protein­DNA complex.14 MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization Expression and purification of the K. lactis DNA binding domain fragment, as well as the selenomethionine substituted version, have been described.7 The DNA oligonucleotides GAGAACGTTC, GAACGTTCTC, GAGAACGT-5Iodo-U-C, GAACGTTC-5-Iodo-U-C, AGGAACGTTCCT, AGGAACGTTC-5-Bromo-U, and GGTTCTAGAACC were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Oligonucleotide Synthesizer and purified by reversed-phase and anionexchange chromatography. Brominated and iodinated versions of the oligonucleotides were synthesized using either 5 -bromo-uracil or 5 -iodo-uracil (Glen Research), respectively, in place of a thymine residue. The DNA was hybridized by heating to 70°C for 15 min and cooling to room temperature overnight. Protein and DNA were mixed at final concentrations of 0.91 and 0.69 mM, respectively, in a buffer of 10 mM Tris, pH7.5, 50 mM sodium chloride, and 400 mM ammonium acetate. The protein­DNA solution was then combined with an equal volume of mother liquor and allowed to equilibrate against a reservoir of mother liquor by vapor diffusion. All three crystals were grown under similar conditions. The 10mer and HtH crystals grew at 18°C in 25­30% PEG4000, 50 mM cacodylate (pH 6.0), 275 mM ammonium acetate, while the TtT crystals grew at 4°C in 20% PEG4000, 10% isoproponal, 50 mM cacodylate (pH 6.0), 200 mM ammonium acetate. Frozen crystals were prepared by a brief wash in mother liquor followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen. All three crystals formed in the C2 space group (Table I). The 10mer crystal has one protein and one oligonucleotide per asymmetric unit, while

the two 12mer crystals have two proteins and two oligonucleotides per asymmetric unit. Data Collection Native data collected at SSRL beam line 7-1 were measured with a 30-cm MAR Research image plate and integrated with MOSFLM.15 MAD data collected at SSRL beam line 1-5 were measured with Fuji image plates, read off-line with a BAS2000 reader, and integrated with DENZO.16 Data collected in house on an RAXIS IIC area detector were integrated with MOSFLM.15 Scaling and truncation of the data were carried out using the programs SCALA and TRUNCATE, respectively, from the CCP4 program suite.17 Statistical information on data collection and processing is given in Table I. Structure Determinations 10mer Although the position of the protein model could be determined with the molecular replacement program AMoRe,18 it was not possible to determine the position of the DNA. When we used an iodinated oligonucleotide, we could not find the expected two strong sites, and instead found several weak sites with occupancies ranging from 0.027 to 0.055 and temperature factors ranging from 41.4 to 66.5 [for an interpretation of this result, see Fig. 3(A) and Results]. Therefore, the structure of the complex of the HSF DBD and the 10mer oligonucleotide was determined by a selenium edge multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiment. The MAD data were collected from a crystal containing selenomethionine-substituted protein. Data were collected at four wavelengths including the inflection point, the absorption peak, a high and a low energy wavelength (Table I). The two selenium sites were found through an analysis of an anomalous difference Patterson synthesis calculated using data from the absorption peak to a resolution of 3.0 Å. The protein has a third selenomethionine, but it is in a disordered loop within the protein.7 The heavy atom parameters were refined and phases were generated with ML-PHARE from the CCP4 package.17 The density modification program DM from the CCP4 package17 was used for solvent flattening. The mean figures of merit for all data from 10.0 to 2.5 Å (2.59 ­2.50 Å in the highest resolution bin) were 0.68 (0.59) from MLPHARE phases and 0.79 (0.69) after solvent flattening (Table II). 12mer Head-to-Head (HtH) Although the position of one of the proteins (protein A) could be determined with AMoRe,18 it was not possible to determine the position of the second protein or either DNA. Therefore, the structure of the complex of the HSF DBD and the 12mer oligonucleotide with the head-tohead binding site was determined by a selenium/ bromine double-edge MAD experiment. The MAD data were collected from a crystal containing selenomethionine-substituted protein and DNA containing a 5-bromo-uracil in place of a thymine base. Data were collected at six wavelengths including both inflection points, both absorption peaks, a middle, and a high

energy wavelength (Table I). Data from the selenium absorption edge wavelength were combined with phases from the AMoRe molecular replacement solution of one of protein positions to generate an anomalous difference Fourier map. Two selenium sites were found in this map. Those two sites were refined, and phases were generated that allowed the identification of an additional two selenium sites through another anomalous difference Fourier map. A further anomalous difference Fourier map, generated using data from the bromineedge wavelength, permitted identification of the two bromine sites. The ML-PHARE and DM programs from the CCP4 package17 were used for generating phases and solvent flattening. The mean figures of merit for all data from 10.0 to 2.5 Å (2.59 ­2.50 Å in the highest resolution bin) were 0.78 (0.64) from ML-PHARE phases and 0.85 (0.73) after solvent flattening (Table II). The initial model was generated using the one protein from the AMoRe molecular replacement. The second protein in the asymmetric unit was positioned in the density by hand. The two DNA strands were modeled as B-form DNA and positioned to fit the density. The positions of the bases were then adjusted to fit the density using O.19 12mer Tail-to-Tail (TtT) The structure of the complex of the HSF DBD and the 12mer oligonucleotide with the tail-to-tail binding site was

determined by direct replacement, using the model of the 12mer head-to-head (HtH) structure refined against the MAD data. The waters were removed and the sequence of the DNA was changed to that of the tail-to-tail oligonucleotide. The sequence of the DNA was later confirmed by a series of simulated annealing omit maps in which various parts of the DNA were omitted. Structure Refinement Refinement was carried out in a similar manner for all three structures. The structures were refined against a working dataset consisting of 90% of the data from 6.0 Å to the highest resolution limit.20 The initial models were refined by torsion angle molecular dynamic simulated annealing following the slow-cool protocol in X-PLOR.21,22 The model was built using SigmaA weighted maps23 generated using data from 20.0 Å to the highest resolution limit. The models were improved though repeated cycles of manual rebuilding in O,19 followed by geometry restrained positional refinement and grouped B-factor refinement in X-PLOR.21 For the final rounds of refinement, individual isotropic B-factors were refined, a bulk solvent correction was applied,24 and a working dataset from 20.0 Å to the highest resolution limit was used in refinement. Waters were added to the models by selecting peaks in the omit maps that were both greater than 3 times r.m.s.d. and within hydrogen bonding distance of a hydrogen bond

RESULTS Crystallography We have determined three crystal structures, all of which contain the K. lactis DNA binding domain, as well as a DNA oligomer that contains two NGAAN repeats. The structures differ in the length of the DNA oligomer and the orientation of the NGAAN repeats. The three structures are referred to as: 10mer for the crystal with a 10mer oligomer with a head-to-head binding site (GAGAACGTTC and its complement GAACGTTCTC); HtH for the crystal with a palindromic 12mer oligomer with a head-to-head binding site (AGGAACGTTCCT); and TtT for the crystal with a palindromic 12mer oligomer with a tail-to-tail binding site (GGTTCTAGAACC). The 10mer crystal contains one protein, chain A, in its asymmetric unit. The 10mer crystal does contain DNA, but it is in a state of static disorder. Thus, it has only been possible to model a portion of the phosphate backbone of the DNA, which will be referred to as DNA C. The HtH structure used a longer oligonucleotide in an attempt to force the DNA into a unique conformation,

while the TtT structure used a different orientation of the two-repeat HSE in order to confirm that the protein­ DNA contacts were sequence independent. The asymmetric units of the HtH and the TtT crystals contain two proteins, chains A and B, and two DNA strands, chains C and D. Packing Topology All three crystals form in the C2 space group (Table I). The HtH and TtT structures are isomorphous, while the 10mer structure has a distinct but related packing topology (Fig. 1). In all three complexes, the proteins form walls parallel to the a face of the crystal and the DNA packs between the walls of protein with the helical axis of the DNA parallel to the c axis. The A proteins in all three structures have nearly identical packing topology. They pack against their symmetry mates in the same relative orientation along the 21 screw axes [Fig. 1(D)], forming continuous columns from one end of the crystal to the other. In the 10mer crystal, the columns of protein A make direct contact with one another in the Z direction, thus forming walls of protein parallel to the a face of the crystal [Fig. 1(A)]. The packing along the 21 screw axis provides contacts in the Y direction in the crystal. However, the

electron density map, generated using the phases from a MAD experiment, shows no continuous density for a well-ordered molecule that could bridge the gap between the walls of protein and thus provide packing contacts in the X direction [Fig. 2(A)]. The HtH and TtT 12mer crystals have a more complicated packing topology, owing to the second protein and DNA. Protein B contacts its 21 screw symmetry mate in an orientation distinct from protein A [compare Fig. 1(D) and (E)], forming columns of protein along the other pair of 21 screw axes in the crystal. Thus, both A and B proteins contribute to packing in the Y direction. The columns of A and B proteins pack parallel to one another in an alternating fashion in the Z direction. These columns form walls of protein, which are parallel to the a face of the crystal in a similar manner to the protein in the 10mer crystal. In both 12mer crystals, the two

DNAs, C and D, bridge the gaps between the walls of protein. DNA C stacks end-to-end alternately with DNA D. DNA C and D do not align their phosphate backbones to create pseudo-continuous double helices, but the helical axes of the DNAs are continuous and make the primary contacts in the Z direction. The DNAs form long columns that lie perpendicular to the columns of protein [Fig. 1(B)]. Packing in the X direction is mediated by alternating layers of protein and DNA. In addition, there are numerous smaller contacts between the proteins and between the proteins and DNAs that are probably all contributing to packing within the crystal [Fig. 1(B)]. DNA Orientation and Conformation Although the experimental density of the 10mer crystal shows no ordered DNA [Fig. 2(A)], there is evidence that

B: Diffraction image from a frozen 10mer crystal taken at SSRL 7-1. The helical fiber diffraction is clearly visible as a series of nearly horizontal stripes starting between the red and blue circles and ending between the green and yellow circles.

the 10mer crystals contain DNA. First, the relative concentrations of protein and DNA were measured directly using crystals that were carefully washed and then dissolved. The stoichiometry of protein and DNA in the crystals was determined to be roughly 3:1, which is close to the expected 2:1 ratio given that the DNA oligonucleotide has two NGAAN repeats. Second, DNA helical fiber diffraction is visible on specific X-ray diffraction images collected from the 10mer crystals [Fig. 2(B)], showing clearly that the DNA is B-form and lies parallel to the Z-axis of the unit cell. The final piece of evidence comes from data collected on a 10mer crystal with a DNA oligonucleotide containing two 5-Iodo-uracils. A difference Fourier between the iodo data and the native data using model phases shows a series of nine peaks with signals above 4 r.m.s.d., which lie in a double helical pattern [Fig. 3(A)]. The distance between pairs of peaks across the helical axis is roughly 12 Å; this distance is close to the distance between two iodines if one superimposes an adenine-iodo-uracil base pair on an iodo-uracil-adenine base pair [Fig. 3(B)]. These peaks lie in the gap between the proteins in the structure along the Z-axis. Therefore, the peaks are assumed to be from the iodines of the DNA oligonucleotides. This leads to the idea that the DNA is statically disordered, i.e., the DNA lies in multiple overlapping orientations. This is similar to what

was seen in a recent crystal structure of a statically disordered 17 base pair RNA duplex.25 However, unlike the RNA structure, the overlap of DNA in the 10mer structure is not perfect, or the entire phosphate backbone, as well as the overlapped bases, would be visible in the electron density. The overlap is best where the phosphate backbone of the DNA is participating in crystal packing, acting as a bridge between the walls of protein, and likely contributing to the minimally 2.5 Å diffraction resolution. The DNAs in the HtH and TtT structures are essentially standard B-form. Analysis of the four DNAs with the program FREEHELIX98 shows an average helical twist of 34.9° and an average rise of 3.26 Å.26 The crystal packing appears to have a greater effect upon the conformations of the DNAs in these crystals than the base sequence. The D helices are more similar to each other than to the C helix with the same base sequence, and the same is true for the C helices (Fig. 4). However, the perturbations are minor, presumably because crystal packing interactions are weak.27,28 The different conformations observed most likely represent allowed conformations that the DNAs adapt in solution; the crystal packing has merely trapped the DNAs in one particular conformation. Protein­Protein and Protein­DNA Interactions The packing of the A proteins with their symmetry mates along the 21 screw axes within the crystals represents the most robust packing interface within the three crystal structures. The buried accessible surface area for this packing in the three crystals averages around 1,770 Å3. This interface is more than double the buried accessible surface area of the next two largest interfaces, which are the 21 screw packing between the B symmetry mates ( 810 Å3) and the interaction between protein B and DNA D ( 713 Å3). Janin and Rodier29 determined that the average size of crystal-packing interactions falls in the range 200 to 1,200 Å with a mean of 570 Å.29 The 21 screw packing motif seen between the A proteins clearly falls outside the normal range of crystal packing interactions. It is interesting to note that the 21 screw packing motif also exists in the apoprotein structure determined previously.7

The proteins are colored as follows: HtH B protein, yellow; TtT B protein, red; 10mer, blue; and apocrystal, green. The TtT, 10mer, and apocrystal proteins superimpose with the HtH protein with r.m.s.d.'s of 0.33, 0.67, and 1.42 Å, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the superposition of the 21 screw symmetry mates from the apoprotein and three cocrystal structures. The packing contacts, as well as the positions of the waters

that are participating in the protein­protein interface, are conserved in all four crystals. In addition, the B-factors are generally lower for residues making crystal packing contacts, indicating a well-ordered interface. This packing imposes a 33­34 Å unit cell along the 21 screw axis. The DNAs in the HtH and TtT structures are making essentially identical interactions with the protein. Given the differences in the sequence between the HtH and TtT oligonucleotides, with only the second and eleventh base pair in common, it appeared likely that the interactions between protein and DNA were sequence independent. This was confirmed by a more detailed analysis of the

The views were chosen to maximize the visibility of the protein­DNA surface area. The critical Arg 250 is highlighted in both structures, showing contact to the phosphate backbone for (A) and contacts to the major groove for (B).

structures. In both structures, the protein sits at the edge of the grooves. The majority of the contacts occur between the proteins and the phosphate backbones of the DNAs, with no interactions in either the major or minor grooves. Based on buried accessible surface area, protein B makes more extensive contacts to the DNA than does protein A, and both proteins make more extensive contacts to the D DNAs than to the C DNAs. Protein B primarily uses the N-terminus of helix 3 (residues 246 to 260) to makes its contacts to the D DNA [see Fig. 6(C) and (D)]. The primary contact with the phosphate backbone is Arg 250 [highlighted in Fig. 7(A)]. Other phosphate backbone contacts occur with the side chain of Arg 228 and the main chains of Phe 245 and Ala 246. Protein A bridges the C and D DNA helices and contacts their DNA phosphates with a set of scattered side chains, none of which are in helix 3 [Fig. 6(A) and (B)]. The 10mer structure shows only one phosphate backbone contact, and this interaction resembles one of the contacts between protein A and DNA C in the 12mer structures (Lys 213). Therefore, all three complexes are related not only by the 21 screw packing motif of the A proteins, but also by the packing of the A protein to DNA. In summary, it appears that neither protein A nor B is making sequence-specific contacts to the DNA. Redesign of the Protein By comparing these three co-crystal structures with the apoprotein structure,7 we developed a hypothesis as to why these particular cocrystal structures did not appear to be the sequence-specific complexes. The 21 screw packing motif found in all four structures (Fig. 5) appears to obscure access to helix 3, the putative DNA recognition helix, by blocking it with the N-terminus and helix 1 of the symmetry mate [for another view see also Fig. 1(D)]. This

packing interface is serendipitous, as it uses the Nterminal end of the protein fragment, which is itself just an isolated domain from a much larger protein. Neither the N-terminus or helix 1 had been predicted from our mutagenesis studies to be critical for function.10 The original N-terminus of the protein fragment started at Ala 193, as an N-terminal methionine added during the cloning process had been post-translationally processed.7 We expressed the fragment in a GST-fusion vector (pGEX2TK), which resulted in the addition of nine residues to the N-terminus after cleavage of the GST moiety. We were able to obtain crystals with the same oligonucleotide used in the TtT cocrystals, although the crystals appeared under different conditions with a different morphology and unit cell dimensions. Subsequent refinement of the structure revealed a complex that is consistent with the previous biochemical and genetic data.14 Specifically, helix 3 sits in the major groove making contacts to the conserved GAA sequence [Fig. 6(E) and (F)]. Arg 250 makes the primary contact to the major groove [highlighted in Fig. 7(B)]. DISCUSSION There are several indications that neither 12mer structure has protein bound specifically to DNA. First, neither protein A nor B docks a secondary structure element into the grooves of the DNA nor do they make contact, direct or water-mediated, with the DNA bases, as has been found in almost every other sequence specific protein­DNA complex. Instead, protein A does not appear to make any significant interactions with the DNA [Fig. 6(A) and (B)], while protein B uses the N-terminus of helix 3 to contact two phosphates at the end of the DNA [Figs. 6(C,D), 7(A)]. Both DNA helices are standard B-like structures, ruling

out the possibility of using an unusual DNA structure for recognition. Second, various DNA footprinting and binding interference assays had indicated a more extensive area of the DNA being in contact with the DNA-binding domain than is observed in the structure.4 For example, methylation protection experiments suggest that the guanine in the NGAAN repeat is bound directly by HSF, yet no interactions were seen. Finally, only one of the eight residues identified as important for DNA binding by biochemical and genetic assays is actually in contact with the DNA. Previous mutational studies on the highly related S. cerevisiae DNA-binding domain had led us to conclude that K. lactis residues K200, W216, S247, R250, Q251, N253, Y255, K259, and G266, are essential or important for function.10 Five of these residues lie in the third helix of the DNA-binding domain (a.a. 244 ­255), the putative recognition helix based upon helix-turn-helix homology, while two others lie along the same surface of the protein (K200, K259). Protein A does not make any side-chain specific contacts to the DNA, and protein B only uses the side-chain of Arg 250 to contact the phosphate backbone [Fig. 7(A)]. To prove that the proteins were not making specific interactions in the HtH crystal, we crystallized and determined the structure of the protein with a 12mer oligonucleotide that contained a tail-to-tail HSE (the palindromic sequence GGTTCTAGAACC) rather than a head-to-head HSE as was used previously. These crystals, called TtT, have nearly the same parameters as the HtH crystals (Table I). The TtT DNA structures are quite similar to the HtH DNA structures with r.m.s.d.'s of 0.61 and 0.72 Å. The A and B proteins make virtually identical contacts to the DNA in the two structures, despite the fact that the DNA sequences are completely different with the exception of the second and eleventh bases, a guanine and cytosine, respectively. Neither of these bases lies in the conserved region of the consensus binding site (i.e., the NGAAN repeat), and the proteins do not make any contacts, either directly or indirectly, to these two bases. Therefore, the proteins in the two 12mer structures are by definition interacting with the DNA in a sequence-independent manner. Final conformation of this occurred when we altered the 21-screw packing motif, predicted to be key to the inability of this protein fragment to form a specific cocrystal complex, and obtained a new cocrystal form.14 The protein used the third helix to sit in the major groove of DNA [Fig. 6(E) and (F)], and the contacts to the bases and phosphate backbone were in agreement with existing genetic and biochemical data,14 suggesting that we had, indeed, crystallized the specific HSF-HSE complex. The HtH and TtT structures are the second published example of a site-specific DNA-binding protein crystallized in a complex with its cognate DNA binding site where the protein and the DNA are not involved in a specific complex. A recent structure of an engineered Cro monomer bound to a half-operator site shows a non-sequence specific interaction with its cognate DNA sequence site30 [Fig. 6(G) and (H)]. Although there are no direct base-specific interactions between the protein and DNA, the Cro-DNA complex contains almost all of the ionic interactions with the DNA

backbone. The protein­DNA interface in this structure buries approximately 75% of the surface are buried in the specific complex.31 As nonspecific complexes are thought to be a "looser" version of the specific complex, primarily retaining the ionic interactions, it is likely that the engineered Cro monomer is binding in a nonspecific complex to its cognate DNA. In addition, this structure has similarities to the structures of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins with noncognate sequences, including glucocorticoid receptor and the restriction endonuclease EcoRV.32­34 The engineered Cro monomer is likely binding nonspecifically because of the lowered binding affinity for a monomer as compared to the natural dimer. The structures of the HSF DNA-binding domain bound in a sequence-independent manner to cognate DNA show much in common with the nonspecific Cro-DNA complex, but, unlike the Cro study, we conclude that our structures are unlikely to be physiologically relevant. For example, in the HtH structure, the interaction between protein B and DNA buries 424 Å2 of surface area, approximately onethird of that buried in the specific complex [compare Fig. 7(A) and (B)]. The protein only contacts two phosphates in comparison to the five phosphates contacted in the specific complex.14 Protein B in the TtT complex behaves similarly to HtH. When compared to the Cro nonspecific complex,30 it is unlikely that the HtH and TtT complexes are true nonspecific complexes. These structures highlight an interesting crystallographic pitfall. When attempting to crystallize complexes between partners that have weak affinity, it is possible to obtain complexes that don't represent the biologically relevant mode of interaction. This can be exacerbated by crystal packing interactions that might occur surreptitiously with the artificially created ends of the isolated protein fragments, as happened in our case. By comparing structures that we obtained with biochemical and genetic data about the specific protein­DNA interaction, we were able to determine that the structures did not represent specific complexes. In the case of the HtH structure, we were able to provide further proof through an additional structure, the TtT structure, where the sequence of the DNA was changed yet the protein made the same contacts to the DNA. Final proof came by altering the crystal packing interface and obtaining a true specific complex. Thus, the complementary approaches of structural biology, biochemistry, and genetics were particularly useful in interpreting the results of crystallization experiments.
