Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), an important enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group between the 2 and the 3 positions of glyceric acid. The gene coding for the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate independent monomeric PGM from Bacillus stearothermophilus (57 kDa), whose activity is extremely pH sensitive and has an absolute and specific requirement for Mn2 , has been cloned and the enzyme overexpressed and purified to homogeneity. Circular dichroism studies showed at most only small secondary structure changes in the enzyme upon binding to Mn2 or its 3-phosphoglycerate substrate, but thermal unfolding analyses revealed that Mn2 but not 3-phosphoglycerate caused a large increase in the enzyme's stability. Diffraction-quality crystals of the enzyme were obtained at neutral pH in the presence of 3-phosphoglyceric acid with ammonium sulfate as the precipitating agent; these crystals diffract X rays to beyond 2.5-Å resolution and belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions, a 58.42, b 206.08, c 124.87 Å, and 90.0°. The selenomethionyl version of the B. stearothermophilus protein has also been overexpressed, purified, and crystallized. Employing these crystals, the determination of the three-dimensional structure of this PGM by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method is in progress. 1999 Academic Press Key Words: Bacillus; circular dichroism; crystallization; glycolysis; phosphoglycerate mutase; spores; X-ray diffraction.

phosphoglycerates and are essential for glucose metabolism in most organisms. There are two general categories of phosphoglycerate mutases, bisphosphoglycerate mutases (bPGMs) whose role is to interconvert 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), and monophosphoglycerate mutases (PGMs)2 that interconvert 2-phosphoglycerate (2PGA) and 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) in glycolysis (Fothergill-Gilmore and Watson, 1989). The bPGMs can carry out three enzymatic reactions: (1) interconversion of 2-PGA and 3-PGA; (2) synthesis of DPG from 1,3-diphosphoglycerate; and (3) breakdown of DPG to 3-PGA via phosphatase activity (FothergillGilmore and Watson, 1989). In contrast, PGMs catalyze primarily the interconversion of 3-PGA and 2-PGA (Fothergill-Gilmore and Watson, 1989). Two types of PGMs are known; one requires DPG for activity (dPGMs) and the other does not (iPGMs). dPGMs are present in vertebrates, certain fungi, and some bacteria, predominantly gram-negative bacteria (Fothergill-Gilmore and Watson, 1989). These enzymes are dimers or tetramers with 27-kDa subunits; the primary sequences of dPGMs are fairly similar across species and exhibit significant similarity to those of bPGMs. The dPGMs can catalyze the same three reactions that are facilitated by bPGMs, but at very different rates (Rose, 1980). A highresolution X-ray crystal structure of the dPGM from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been obtained, and analysis of this structure as well as structural information about another dPGM has shed light on the catalytic mechanism of this group of enzymes (Campbell et al., 1974; Uhrinova et al., 1997; Ridgen et al., 1998). S. cerevisiae enzyme is a tetramer having the arrangement of a pair of dimers with 246 residues

per monomer (Ridgen et al., 1998). The tetramer as a whole has a central -sheet structure surrounded on the outside by -helices. There is only one independent active site per monomer and this site is well separated from the contact area between the monomeric units. Every monomer consists of two domains with the larger one having a nucleotide binding fold even though the enzyme does not have any physiological requirement for nucleotide binding. The active site reveals a possible mechanism of action of this enzyme and contains a histidine residue that is phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme (Fothergill-Gilmore and Watson, 1989). The iPGMs are found in all plants, selected invertebrates, certain fungi, selected algae, and some bacteria, predominantly gram-positive bacteria (Leadlay et al., 1977; Singh and Setlow, 1979; Watabe and Freese, 1979; Fothergill-Gilmore and Watson, 1989; Fothergill-Gilmore and Michels, 1993; Grana et al., 1995). These enzymes can have phosphatase activity toward 3-PGA (Britton et al., 1971), but unlike dPGMs and bPGMs do not have DPG phosphatase activity (Breathnach and Knowles, 1977). The chain length of iPGMs is much larger than that of dPGMs, and there is no significant sequence similarity between the iPGMs and either the dPGMs or the bPGMs (Singh and Setlow, 1979; Watabe and Freese, 1979; Fothergill-Gilmore and Watson, 1989; Fothergill-Gilmore and Michels, 1993; Leyva-Vazquez and Setlow, 1994; Grana et al., 1995). However, the primary sequences of all known iPGMs, even those from different kingdoms, are quite similar, suggesting that they have a common ancestor (Grana et al., 1995). Recent work has indicated that iPGMs have some limited sequence homology with phosphopentomutases, alkaline phosphatases, and certain sulfatases (Galperin et al., 1998). However, this homology is only over a small segment ( 15%) of the iPGM sequence. The iPGMs from endospore forming gram-positive bacteria such as the various Bacillus and Clostridium species have additional novel features in that the catalytic activity of these enzymes: (i) absolutely and specifically requires Mn2 and (ii) is extremely pH sensitive (Singh and Setlow, 1979; Watabe and Freese, 1979; Kuhn et al., 1993, 1995; Chander et al., 1998). These two properties appear both related and important in regulating the activity of these enzymes during sporulation and spore germination in Bacillus species, and probably Clostridium species as well (Kuhn et al., 1993, 1995; Chander et al., 1998). Briefly, under conditions of nutrient limitation, cells of Bacillus and Clostridium species undergo sporulation, resulting in the formation of a dormant spore. During sporulation the pH in the developing spore falls to 6.5, which appears to

decrease the activity of this cell's PGM sufficiently to cause the accumulation of a large depot of 3-PGA in the dormant spore (Magill et al., 1996). When spores return to life via germination, the intraspore pH rapidly rises to approximately 8, thus reactivating the spore's PGM and allowing the utilization of the spore's 3-PGA depot (Setlow and Kornberg, 1970; Swerdlow et al., 1981; Magill et al., 1996). Utilization of the 3-PGA depot then provides a significant amount of the ATP needed in the early minutes of spore germination (Setlow and Kornberg, 1970). Although much is known about the biological significance of the Mn2 requirement and pH sensitivity of the PGMs from gram-positive spore formers, there is essentially no knowledge of the structural bases for these properties. Indeed, the three-dimensional structure of an iPGM has yet to be determined. To address this latter deficiency, in this communication we report the production and purification of the native and the selenomethionyl derivative of B. stearothermophilus PGM. The secondary structure of the native protein was studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and thermal unfolding analysis, and the effect of Mn2 and the 3-PGA substrate on the structure of the enzyme was also assessed. Additionally, the native and the selenomethionyl forms of the enzyme were crystallized in the presence of Mn2 and the 3-PGA substrate, and these crystals were used to obtain and analyze initial X-ray diffraction data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of B. stearothermophilus pgm. Plasmid pPS2673 containing a 3.9-kb partial Sau3A fragment of B. stearothermophilus DNA cloned in the BamHI site of plasmid pUC13 was a gift from Dr. F. Rentier-Delrue (Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et de Genie Genetique, Universite de Liege, B6, B-4000 Liege, Belgium) (Rentier-Delrue et al., 1993). A 1.57-kb XbaI/MfeI fragment containing the pgm gene with its ribosome binding site and stop codon was isolated, the ends were filled, and BamHI linkers were added. After BamHI digestion, the fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pUC19, transformed into Escherichia coli with selection for ampicillin (50 µg/mL) resistance on LB medium (Sambrook et al., 1989) plates giving strain PS2712, and the insert from the plasmid in this strain was sequenced. The sequence of B. stearothermophilus pgm has been assigned GenBank Accession No. AF120091. For expression of B. stearothermophilus pgm, the 1.57-kb BamHI fragment from pPS2712 was cloned in the BamHI site of plasmid pUSH2 (Schon and Schumann, 1994), which replicates in ¨ both E. coli and B. subtilis. The pgm:pUSH2 plasmid was transformed into an E. coli M15 strain that contained a plasmid expressing LacI (plasmid pGS3 (LeGrice, 1990)), and transformants were selected on LB medium plates containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin and 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol giving strain PS2723. B. subtilis strain 1012 (Saito et al., 1979) was transformed with pgm:pUSH2 to chloramphenicol resistance (3 µg/mL) giving strain PS2726. This B. subtilis strain also contains plasmid pBL1, which produces LacI and confers erythromycin resistance (10 µg/mL) (LeGrice, 1990).

CHANDER ET AL. PGM was assayed by the two-step assay as described (Chander et al., 1998), but the first step was carried out at 65°C; one unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 µmol of 3-PGA converted to 2-PGA/min. PGM concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an absorption coefficient of 42 180 mol 1cm 1 (Pace et al., 1995). Preparation of metal-free enzyme, assay of PGM at pH values of 6 to 8, determination of the enzyme's Km for 3PGA, and calculation of free metal ion concentrations were as described (Chander et al., 1998). Sodium dodecyl sulfate­ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE) was on 10% gels with the buffers described by Laemmli (1970). Mass spectrometry utilized the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight methodology (Liang et al., 1996) and a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Elite (Farmington, MA) instrument. Protein samples were mixed with sinapinic acid (1:10 ratio) and the spectra were calibrated internally with bovine serum albumin. CD spectroscopy and thermal melting analyses. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired on an AVIV 62DS Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ) in a quartz cuvette with a 0.1-mm path length. The CD spectra were measured from 185 to 260 nm every 0.5 nm with 4-s averaging per point and a 1.5-nm bandwidth. Spectra were signal averaged by adding five scans and the baseline was corrected by subtracting the buffer spectrum acquired using the same conditions. The temperature of the cell holder was regulated by a Lauda RS2 circulating water bath (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY) and was monitored with a thermosensor. The spectra were evaluated using the data from 185 to 260 nm and the method of Chang et al. (1978). Thermal unfolding curves were determined by CD spectroscopy on a Jasco J-175 Spectropolarimeter at 225 nm. The temperature was regulated and monitored using a Model PTC-348WI Peltiertype temperature control system (Jasco Corp., Japan). Data points were taken every 1.0°C and the measured signal averaged 8 s per point. The CD data at each temperature were analyzed in millidegrees (Muccio et al., 1992). Crystallization. Crystallization of methionyl PGM utilized the vapor diffusion hanging drop method with 1- to 2-µL sample volumes and 24-well Linbro culture plates (Ducruix and Giege, 1992; McPherson, 1982). Diffraction-quality rectangular platelike crystals (1.0 0.3 0.1 mm) were grown at 22°C by mixing equal volumes of protein ( 50 mg/ml), 150 mM 3-PGA (pH 7.4) in Buffer E, and reservoir solution (2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 25 mM zinc acetate, 20 mM cesium chloride, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% polyethylene glycol 200, and 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4)) and equilibrating against 0.3 mL of reservoir solution. The selenomethionyl protein was crystallized under similar conditions (but 1.9 M ammonium sulfate) with 10 mM DTT in all solutions. Microseeding with crushed native crystals was necessary to initiate crystal growth. X-ray diffraction. Native and selenomethionine PGM crystals were cryoprotected by briefly soaking them in a solution of 23% ethylene glycol, 2.4 M ammonium sulfate, and 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4) and flash frozen at 170°C in a nitrogen flow using a Cryostream Cooler (Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). The native crystals were diffracted with a CuK rotating anode X-ray source mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. Double-focusing mirrors (Molecular Structure Corp., The Woodlands, TX) were also used. The crystal to detector distance was 16.0 cm, 2 was 0°, and 1.0° oscillation images were exposed for about 40 min each; the data were processed with Denzo/ Scalepack package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1996). X-ray data collection from the selenomethionine PGM crystals used a wavelength of 0.98 Å and the crystallographic set-up and accompanying support on the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source F-2 beamline and the Area Detector Systems Corporation (ADSC) 2k CCD detector. The data were processed with Mosfilm and CCP4 packages (Szebenyi et al., 1997).

Overexpression of native and selenomethionyl PGM. For overexpression of native PGM, strain PS2726 was grown to an OD600 of 1.5 at 30°C in 15 L of LB medium containing 0.5% glucose, 10 µg/mL erythromycin, and 3 µg/mL chloramphenicol. Isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to 1 mM to induce PGM synthesis, and 4 h later the cells were harvested by centrifugation. For overexpression of selenomethionyl PGM, strain PS2723 was grown at 30°C in 6 L of LB medium containing 0.5% glucose, 100 µg/mL ampicillin, and 30 µg/mL chloramphenicol to an OD600 of 0.8, harvested, washed three times with 30°C M9 medium (Sambrook et al., 1989), and resuspended in 6 L of M9 medium containing 1 µg/mL thiamine, 100 µg/mL L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, and L-threonine, and 50 µg/mL L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-leucine, and L-selenomethionine (Doublie, 1997). After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, PGM synthesis was induced by the addition of IPTG to 1 mM, and 4 h later cells were harvested by centrifugation. Purification of B. stearothermophilus PGM. Purification was at 4°C unless otherwise specified, ammonium sulfate concentrations are the percentage saturation at 25°C, and enzyme was concentrated using Centriprep-30 concentrators (Amicon, Beverley, MA). One hundred grams (wet wt) of induced PS2726 cells was resuspended in 200 mL of 50 mM Hepes­KOH (pH 7.4), 10% sucrose, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Lysozyme was added to 300 µg/mL and EDTA to 1 mM; the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 20 min, sonicated twice for 20 s, and centrifuged at 64 000g for 1 h, and the supernatant fluid was made 1.2 mM in MnCl2 and 100 µM in phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After addition of streptomycin sulfate (30 mL of a 20% solution in Buffer A (20 mM Hepes­KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 100 µM PMSF, 50 µM EDTA, 250 µM MnCl2), the mixture was stirred in the cold room for 15 min and centrifuged at 9770g for 15 min. The supernatant fluid was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, with the great majority of the PGM activity recovered in the 50­80% ammonium sulfate precipitate. This precipitate was resuspended in a small volume of Buffer A and dialyzed overnight against 12 L of the same buffer. The dialyzed material was incubated for 15 min at 70°C, chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 64 000g for 1 h to remove denatured proteins. The soluble fraction was loaded on a 600-mL DEAE­Sephadex A-50 column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was washed with 50 mL of Buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 1.2 L Buffer A to 1.2 L of Buffer A containing 500 mM KCl. Peak fractions from the DEAE­ Sephadex column were pooled, made to 45% of saturation in ammonium sulfate, and loaded on a 50-mL octyl-agarose column equilibrated in Buffer B (20 mM Hepes­KOH (pH 7.4), 100 µM DTT, 50 µM EDTA, 250 µM MnCl2, 45% of saturation in ammonium sulfate). The column was washed with 100 mL of Buffer B and eluted with a linear gradient of 200 mL of Buffer B to 200 mL of Buffer B with no ammonium sulfate. Peak fractions were concentrated to 5 mL and loaded on an S200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in Buffer C (20 mM Hepes­KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, 100 µM DTT, 50 µM EDTA, 500 µM MnCl2 ), which was run on a Biologics chromatography system (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Peak fractions were concentrated and dialyzed for 12 h against 12 L of Buffer D (10 mM Hepes­KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mM DTT, 50 µM EDTA, 1 mM MnCl2 ); the PGM was concentrated to 2 mM, made 5 mM in MnCl2, dialyzed against Buffer E (10 mM Hepes­KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 50 µM EDTA), concentrated to 50 mg/ml, and stored at 80°C. The yield was 100 mg of purified PGM with an 15% recovery. Selenomethionyl PGM was purified from 18 g (wet wt) of induced cells of strain PS2723 essentially as described above, except that volumes were adjusted appropriately, and buffers contained 10 mM DTT and were degassed to minimize oxidation of selenomethionine (Hendrickson et al., 1990). The yield was 6 mg of purified protein.

The sequences of iPGMs from B. megaterium (Bme) (Schlapfer and Zuber, 1992; and GenBank Accession No. AF120090), B. stearothermophilus (Bst) (this work; ¨ GenBank Accession No. AF120091), B. subtilis (Bsu) (Leyva-Vazquez and Setlow, 1994; GenBank Accession No. L29475), and C. acetobutylicum (Cac) (available at www.ncbs.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/unfinishedgenome.html) are given in the one-letter code. Positions at which all four proteins have the same amino acid are denoted by an asterisk below the sequences.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Cloning and Sequence of B. stearothermophilus pgm Amino acid sequences of iPGMs from three Bacillus and Clostridium species are known (Fig. 1). All three sequences are quite similar, suggesting that the features causing the Mn2 requirement and extreme pH dependence in these PGMs are likely to be conserved in the enzymes from this group of organisms. Consequently, we decided to carry out structural investigations using the PGM from B. stearothermophilus, as enzymes from this thermophile are often extraordinarily stable and amenable to structural studies, in particular X-ray crystallography (Harada et al., 1997; Hsiao et al., 1997). Although B. stearothermophilus pgm has not been

cloned, the two known pgm genes from Bacillus species are in an operon that includes (in order) the genes encoding phosphoglycerate kinase ( pgk), triosephosphate isomerase, PGM, and enolase (eno) (Schlapfer and Zuber, 1992; Leyva-Vazquez and Set¨ low, 1994). Even in the evolutionarily more distant Clostridium acetobutylicum this gene order seems to have been maintained (see unfinished genome sequence for this organism at www.ncbs.nlm.nih.gov/ BLAST/unfinishedgenome.html). It therefore seemed likely that B. stearothermophilus pgm would also be downstream of tpi and precede eno. Indeed, DNA sequence analysis (data not shown) showed that a 3.9-kb partial Sau3A fragment of B. stearothermophilus DNA carrying tpi (Rentier-Delrue et al., 1993;

sequence of the encoded protein (Fig. 1).As expected, the sequence of B. stearothermophilus PGM was extremely similar to those of other Bacillus and Clostridium species, with 51% identical amino acids in all four of these 510- to 511-residue proteins and 74% identical amino acids in the three proteins from Bacillus species.

FIG. 2. SDS­PAGE of B. stearothermophilus PGM. SDS­ PAGE of samples taken throughout the purification of methionyl PGM was carried out under reducing conditions as described under Materials and Methods, and the gel was stained with Coomassie blue. 5 µg of protein was run in the various lanes except for lane 4, which had only 3.5 µg. The samples in the various lanes are from (1) crude lysate supernatant fluid; (2) dialyzed ammonium sulfate precipitate; (3) heat step supernatant fluid; (4) DEAE­Sephadex column pool; (5) octyl-agarose column pool; and (6) S200 column pool. The numbers to the left of the figure indicate the position of molecular mass markers in kDa run on the same gel, and the arrow denotes the PGM.

pPS2673, see Materials and Methods) also contained a part of both pgk and eno as well as the complete pgm gene. Subsequent subcloning and DNA sequencing gave the complete sequence of B. stearothermophilus pgm and this allowed deduction of the amino acid

The cloning of B. stearothermophilus pgm allowed the overexpression and purification of the encoded protein as described under Materials and Methods. The purified methionyl PGM had a specific activity of 1500 U/mg protein and the purified selenomethionyl protein had a specific activity of 500 U/mg protein. Analysis of samples taken throughout the purification of either protein showed the enrichment of a band that comprised 98% of the protein in the final samples (Fig. 2; and data not shown). Automated sequence analysis of the purified methionyl protein gave the sequence SKKPVAL, which is identical to that predicted for B. stearothermophilus PGM except for the amino-terminal methionine, which is presumably removed posttranslationally. Isoelectric focusing of purified PGM also gave a

single band containing 98% of the protein. This band had an isoelectric point of 6, which is in good agreement with the isoelectric point of 6.2 calculated based on the protein's sequence.

Assays of purified B. stearothermophilus PGM showed that at pH values of 6, 7, and 8, the metalfree enzyme had 0.1% of the activity of enzyme with 1 mM Mn2 . Only Mn2 was able to support enzyme activity, as 10 µM­10 mM Ca2 , Co2 , Mg2 , and Zn2 gave 2% of the activity with Mn2 . The enzyme was also extremely sensitive to pH; when the enzyme was assayed with 4 µM free Mn2 , the activity increased 280-fold as the pH was raised from 6 to 8. However, the pH dependence of this PGM became less pronounced as the Mn2 concentration was increased, and the enzyme's activity rose only 25-fold between pH 6 and 8, when assayed with 1 mM Mn2 . These properties of the B. stearothermophilus PGM are very similar to those of PGMs from other Bacillus species (Chander et al., 1998). At pH 7.4 and 1 mM MnCl2 the Km of the B. stearothermophilus enzyme for 3-PGA was 4.4 mM, which is similar to values obtained with the PGMs from other Bacillus and Clostridium species (Chander et al., 1998). The final purified protein migrated on SDS­PAGE as a single band of 60 kDa, in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 57 004 Da. Mass spectrometry gave values for the molecular masses of the methionyl and selenomethionyl PGMs of 56 877 and 57 194 Da. The difference in molecular weights indicates that there are 8 1 selenomethionine residues per protein molecule; since there are 9 methionine residues in purified PGM, our recombi-

nant selenomethionyl PGM has near 100% substitution of selenomethionine for methionine. CD Spectroscopic Analyses CD spectroscopy was used to determine the presence of secondary structure elements in the purified methionyl PGM. At pH 7.4 and 22°C a far-UV CD spectrum of PGM in the presence of MnCl2 is similar to spectra of moderately -helical proteins (Fig. 3). The evaluation of the secondary structure components of the protein's spectrum between 185 and 260 nm (Fig. 3) indicated that the protein contains 24 5% -helix, 53% -sheet, and 23% random coil (Chang et al., 1978). The secondary structure content changed only slightly upon removal of Mn2 or addition of 2.5 or 10 mM 3-PGA or when the temperature was increased to 45 or 65°C (Fig. 3; and data not shown). To further investigate the influence of Mn2 and 3-PGA on the structure of PGM, CD spectroscopy was used to examine the protein's thermal unfolding

(Fig. 4). The melting point determined for PGM free of both Mn2 and substrate was 74°C, and this value increased to 82°C upon addition of Mn2 ; however, addition of 3-PGA had no further effect. The thermal unfolding of the protein also appeared to be irreversible. The large difference in the melting temperatures of PGM with and without Mn2 indicates that Mn2 adds significantly to the thermal stability of the enzyme. In contrast, previous work has indicated that Mn2 destabilizes the catalytic activity of PGMs from mesophilic Bacillus and Clostridium species (Chander et al., 1998). Together, these data suggest that the enzyme with Mn2 likely has a slightly different structure than the metal-free protein, and the CD studies further suggest that the major structural differences between PGM plus and minus Mn2 are most likely on the tertiary level, consisting of rearrangements of secondary structure elements.

within 1 month at 22°C in 2.0 M ammonium sulfate at neutral pH. These crystals had a rather small cross section and diffracted X rays to only 3.0-Å resolution. Upon refinement of the crystallization conditions (see Materials and Methods) we obtained diffraction-quality rectangular plate crystals (1.0 0.3 0.1 mm) within 7 days at 22°C (Fig. 5); the presence of 3-PGA was essential for crystal growth. The selenomethionyl protein was crystallized under essentially the same conditions as the methionyl PGM, although microseeding was needed to initiate crystal formation.

The requirement for 3-PGA to obtain crystallization of the B. stearothermophilus PGM suggests that 3-PGA causes some change in the enzyme's structure. As noted above, the CD studies indicated that 3-PGA has at most only a small effect on the secondary structure of B. stearothermophilus PGM and has no significant effect on the thermal stability of the enzyme (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that 3-PGA also has no major effect on PGM's tertiary structure. However, since the protein crystallized only in the presence of 3-PGA, this substrate must have some, albeit small, effect on the protein's tertiary structure. The substrate requirement for B. stearothermophilus crystal growth is in contrast to the behavior of the dPGM from S. cerevisiae, which crystallized without a PGA substrate; indeed, soaking these crystals with the substrate caused them to crack (Ridgen et al., 1998). These different crystallization properties are consistent with the quite different amino acid sequences of the B. stearothermophilus iPGM and the S. cerevisiae dPGM and suggest that these proteins may have very different structures. X-Ray Diffraction and Analysis To minimize decay in the X-ray beam, crystals were cryoprotected by briefly soaking them in an ethylene glycol solution and flash frozen to 170°C as described under Materials and Methods. Under these conditions, the crystals showed very little diffraction decay with increased resolution upon X-ray exposure, and the crystals of methionyl PGM diffracted X-rays beyond 2.5-Å resolution (Fig. 6). Analysis of the diffraction data for the methionyl PGM using the autoindexing procedure of Denzo (Otwinowski and Minor, 1996) indicated that the crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221 with lattice parameters a 58.42, b 206.08, c 124.87 Å, and 90.0°. The crystal volume per unit of protein molecular weight, Vm, of 3.3 Å3/Da, is consistent with one molecule of the enzyme in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 63% (Matthews, 1968). A 2.5-Å resolution native data set was collected for the methionyl PGM crystals, and the diffraction data were processed and scaled with Denzo and Scalepack (Otwinowski and Minor, 1996). A total of 102 535 observed reflections were processed and reduced to 26 577 unique reflections with an Rmerge of 11.3%. The data were 99.8% complete with an average I/ (I ) of 11.3. The data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The selenomethionyl enzyme crystals also diffracted X rays to beyond 2.5-Å resolution and were isomorphous to the native crystals. The selenomethionyl diffraction data were processed with Mosfilm and CCP4 (Szebenyi et al., 1997). The unit cell parameters of these crystals

The determination of the three-dimensional crystal structure by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion is currently in progress (Henrickson and Ogata, 1996). Structural information obtained from the X-ray crystallographic studies of this PGM will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of this enzyme, in particular the relationships between its structure and its function. Knowledge of the enzyme's structure, in particular its active site, may also allow design of potent inhibitory agents, and specific inhibitors of this type of PGM might have therapeutic utility not only against spore formers, but perhaps against many other gram-positive bacteria as well.
