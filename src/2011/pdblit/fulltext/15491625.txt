An On-pathway Hidden Intermediate and the Early Rate-limiting Transition State of Rd-Apocytochrome b562 Characterized by Protein Engineering
Zheng Zhou, Yingzi Huang and Yawen Bai*
Laboratory of Biochemistry Center for Cancer Research National Cancer Institute NIH, Building 37, Room 6114E Bethesda, MD 20892, USA The folding pathway of Rd-apocytochrome b562, a four-helix bundle protein, was characterized using Trp and Ala/Gly pair mutations. We found that the Trp mutants (F65W) of both the fully folded Rd-apocytochrome b562 and a partially unfolded intermediate with the N-terminal helix (helix I) unfolded, fold with identical folding rates, providing direct evidence for the conclusion that the rate-limiting transition state folds before the partially unfolded intermediate; and that this hidden intermediate is an on-pathway intermediate. We further characterized the helical structures formed in the rate-limiting transition state by measuring the folding/unfolding rates for Ala/Gly pair mutations at solvent-exposed positions. Little change in folding rates occurred for the Ala/Gly pair mutations at positions in helix I and the C-terminal regions of helix II and IV. In contrast, a significant difference in folding rates was observed for the Ala/Gly pair mutations in helix III and the N-terminal regions of helix II and IV, suggesting that helix III and the N-terminal regions of helix II and IV are formed in the rate-limiting transition state. These results complement those obtained from earlier studies and help to define the folding pathway of Rd-apocytochrome b562 in more detail.

To understand how proteins fold, it is necessary to characterize the folding pathways in detail, which includes folding intermediates, transition states, and the order of these states in folding reactions. Although it is now possible to obtain the structures for intermediates at atomic resolution,1,2 determination of their order in the folding reaction has been difficult. For transition states, highresolution structures are still not available, since they cannot be populated for structure determination under any conditions using available experimental methods. So far, protein engineering is the best available method to characterize the transition state.3,4 With this method, the effect of scanning mutations on the folding rate was measured and used to infer interactions in the transition state.

example, if a mutation changes the folding rate, it is concluded that the mutated residue forms interactions with other residues in the transition state. If a mutation has no effect on the folding rate but changes the stability of the native state, then the residue is considered to be unfolded in the transition state. Usually, the ratio of the free energy change in the transition state over the free energy change in the native state upon a single  mutation ðDDGTS­U =DDGNU Þ, termed as F, is determined and used to derive the structure formed in the transition state.4 Zero F values suggest that the mutated residues are unfolded in the transition state, whereas non-zero values of F suggest that certain structures at the mutation sites are present. So far, most protein engineering studies focused on the hydrophobic core residues.5 In only a few cases, mutations of solvent-exposed residues have been used to explore the formation of secondary structures.6­9 For a-helix formation, mutations from Ala to Gly were used. This is because the difference in the propensities for forming an a-helical structure is

758 relatively small among the 20 amino acids. Ala to Gly mutation leads to the largest change in free energy (w1.0 kcal/mol) (see Richardson et al.10 and reference therein). Previously, using a phage-display-proteolysis method,11 we redesigned a four-helix bundle protein based on apocytochrome b562 (see Figure 1). We showed that this redesigned apocytochrome b562 (Rd-apocyt b562) has a stably folded structure11 and folds in an apparently two-state manner12 in the absence of detectable kinetic folding intermediates. However, two partially unfolded forms (PUFs) were identified in a native-state hydrogen exchange experiment.12 PUF1 has helix I and a part of helix IV unfolded. PUF2 has helix I alone unfolded. These results have led to the suggestion that these PUFs exist after the rate-limiting transition state (RLTS),12 i.e. U5RLTS5{PUF15PUF2}5N. Here, RLTS represents the rate-limiting transition state. In addition, the rate-limiting transition state has been characterized by studying the effect of truncation mutations of the hydrophobic core residues on the folding rate.12 Mutations of the residues in the two middle helices have significant effect on the folding rate, whereas mutations at other positions have little effect on the folding rates, suggesting that formation of the two middle helices has occurred in the rate-limiting transition state. Moreover, the two hidden intermediates have been populated using a native-state hydrogen exchange-directed protein engineering method.13

The Folding Pathway of Rd-apocytochrome b562

Five hydrophobic residues that are part of the hydrophobic core in helix I were mutated to Gly and Asp to selectively destabilize the native state and populate PUF2.13 Three more Gly mutations in the C-terminal end of helix IV were made in addition to the mutations in helix I to populate PUF1.14 The structures of the PUF1 and PUF2 mimics at atomic resolution have been solved using multi-dimensional NMR.1,14 To test the earlier conclusion that the rate-limiting transition state folds before the PUFs and the PUFs are on the folding pathway, here we compared the folding rate of the PUF2 mimic and the native state with the same mutation (F65W). Here, the Trp mutation was used to provide a fluorescence probe for monitoring the folding kinetics of the PUF2 mimic. We found that the folding rates of the PUF2 mimic and the native sate are identical, providing strong evidence for the conclusion that PUF2 folds after the rate-limiting transition state and is on the folding pathway. To characterize the secondary structures formed in the rate-limiting transition state, we made 13 Ala/Gly pair mutations at positions that are solvent-accessible in the helical structures of the wild-type protein. We found that the secondary structures formed in the rate-limiting transition state include helix III and the N-terminal regions of helix II and helix IV. An early rate-limiting transition state Previously, we proposed that the rate-limiting transition state in the folding of Rd-apocyt b562 occurs earlier than the formation of the PUFs detected by the native-state hydrogen exchange method. This conclusion was based on the fact that single-exponential folding kinetics was observed using fluorescence and circular dichroism; and the logarithm of the folding rate is a linear function of denaturant concentrations; i.e. no stable early folding intermediates were identifiable.12 To provide more direct evidence for this conclusion, here we studied the folding kinetics of the PUF2 mimic. We reasoned that if the intermediate forms after the rate-limiting transition state, then both the PUF2 mimic and the fully folded protein should share the same rate-limiting transition state and therefore fold with the same rate. However, if PUF2 is an early sub-millisecond folding intermediate that exists before the rate-limiting transition state in folding, it should fold faster than the fully folded state and may not be detectable at any concentrations of denaturant using a stopped-flow machine that has a dead-time of w1 ms. In order to provide a fluorescence probe for the PUF2 mimic, we made Trp mutations at position 65 (F65W) for both the PUF2 mimic and the fully folded Rd-apocyt b562 (see Figure 1). Figure 2 shows the folding/unfolding rates of the F65W mutants of the PUF2 mimic and the fully folded state as a function of urea concentrations. The folding rates of Rd-apccyt b562 and the PUF2 mimic are essentially

759 the fully folded Rd-apocyt b562, suggesting that this Trp residue forms additional non-native but stabilizing interactions in the rate-limiting transition state and is consistent with our earlier observation of a broad distribution of non-native interactions in the PUF2 mimic.1 They suggest that the repacking of non-native hydrophobic side-chains per se is fast and cannot be the rate-limiting factor for folding.1 The on-pathway nature of PUF2 A PUF identified by native-state hydrogen exchange is an equilibrium intermediate. A general description of a protein folding reaction with an intermediate is the triangle scheme:

The broken line represents the chevron plot of Rd-apocyt b562. Materials and methods: all mutations in this study were made using a Quick-change kit (Strategene, CA) based on the plasmids encoding the Rd-apocyt b56212 and the PUF2-mimic.1,13 Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21DE3) using the pET-17b vector and purified using ion-exchange and reversephase HPLC (water and acetonitrile) as described.12 GdmCl was ultrapure grade (Sigma). Their concentrations were measured based on refractive indexes. Stopped-flow kinetic folding/unfolding were performed with a Biologic SFM4 machine (Grenoble, France). Kinetic rate constants were measured by monitoring the change of fluorescence signal. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm and emission was collected using a filter that cuts off the signal below 320 nm. Folding was initiated by diluting proteins in high denaturant concentrations with folding buffer (50 mM NaAc, pH 4.8). Unfolding was initiated by mixing protein solution in water with a high concentration of denaturant. Each kinetic trace was fitted with a single exponential to obtain the rate constant. The observed rate constants kobs versus denaturant concentrations were fitted with the following equations: kobs Z kf C ku log kf ð½GdmClÞ Z log kf ðH2 OÞKmf ½GdmCl log ku ð½GdmClÞ Z log ku ðH2 OÞ C mu ½GdmCl (1) (2) (3)

identical, whereas their unfolded rates are very different. These results indicate that the PUF2 mimic and the fully folded state do share a common rate-limiting transition state, providing strong evidence for the conclusion that the rate-limiting transition state in the folding of Rd-apocyt b562 exists before the PUF2. Similar folding behavior has been proposed for several other small proteins, including cytochrome c,15,16 barnase,17,18 and a construct of the third domain of PDZ.19 It is interesting to note that the F65W mutant of the PUF2 mimic shown in Figure 2 folds faster than

In principle, all three species can convert to each other directly on a multi-dimensional free-energy surface, in particular when the folding of U to I, I to N, and U to N have similar rates. In such cases, there is no on or off-pathway issue regarding the intermediate. A triangle scheme is necessary for describing the folding kinetics. However, when the relative conversion rates of the three steps are very different, an on and off-pathway issue can occur and is physically meaningful, which reflects how frequent that folding goes through the intermediate. If folding occurs through the intermediate with very low frequency, then the intermediate may be considered as an off-pathway intermediate. Based on the relative folding rates, three special cases can occur. (i) The direct folding from U to N is the slowest step and I is considered as an onpathway folding intermediate (U5I5N). (ii) The direct folding from I to N is the slowest step and I is considered as an off-pathway intermediate on the side of the unfolded state (I5U5N). (iii) The direct folding from U to I is the slowest step and I is considered as an off-pathway intermediate on the side of the native state (U5N5I). Accordingly, if the folding from U to I can be shown to have the same rate as the apparent folding from U to N, the third case can be excluded. Moreover, if I can be further shown to be undetectable in the kinetic folding experiment, then the second case can be further disproved, which would leave the first case as the reaction scheme. As illustrated in Figure 2, the folding rate from U to the PUF2 mimic is the same as that from U to the native state, indicating direct folding from U to I is not slow, excluding the possibility of U5N5PUF2. From previous discussion, it is also known that the PUF2 cannot be detected in the kinetic folding of Rd-apocyt b562.12 Therefore, PUF2 is not an early intermediate that populates before the rate-limiting step. Therefore, PUF2 has to be an on-pathway intermediate as in U5PUF25N and

760 the rate-limiting transition state is between U and PUF2. It should be noted, however, that the above onpathway conclusion on the PUF2 intermediate is based on the assumption that the native state has been dramatically destabilized by the mutations to the extent that it has a higher free energy than the transition state in the PUF2 mimic. This is likely, since the mutations used to obtain the PUF2 mimic involve changes of five large hydrophobic residues in the core to Gly/Asp and folding of Rd-apocyt b562 has a low kinetic barrier (w3 kcal/mol with kfw104 s if the up-limit of the folding rate for proteins is w1 ms). However, if this assumption failed, i.e. the native state is more stable than the transition state, then the native state could still exist between U and I. Further folding experiments with the complete deletion of the N-terminal helix of Rdapocyt b562 to represent the PUF2 intermediate will be performed to test this assumption. Thus, the current experimental results may be considered to strongly support the conclusion that the PUF2 intermediate is on the folding pathway. But they have not proven it absolutely. DDG  TS­U of Ala/Gly pair mutations In earlier studies we have characterized the sidechain interactions in the rate-limiting transition state of Rd-apocyt b562 by mutating the hydrophobic core residues.12 Mainly, mutations of hydrophobic residues in the two middle helices have a significant effect on the folding rate, whereas mutations at other positions have little effect on the folding rate.

The Folding Pathway of Rd-apocytochrome b562

To investigate the helical structures formed in the rate-limiting transition state, here we made Ala/ Gly pair mutations at 13 solvent-accessible positions of Rd-apocyt b562 (see Figure 1). The effect of such pair mutations on the stability of the protein should mainly reflect their intrinsic propensities to form a-helix and have information on the helical structures formed in the rate-limiting transition state. The folding and unfolding rates of the Ala/Gly mutations as a function of denaturant concentrations were measured. These pair mutations are classified into two groups. The first group includes Ala/Gly pair mutations that have similar folding rates, whereas those with different folding rates are classified in the second group. They are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The experimental data for each mutant are fitted with a two-state model (see the legend to Figure 2). The kinetic parameters obtained from the fitting, along with the changes in the activation free energy and the global unfolding free energy for each pair of mutants, are listed in Table 1. Figure 5(a) summarizes the change in the  activation free energy, DDGTS­U , for each Ala/Gly pair mutation, along with those for the hydrophobic core mutations obtained from earlier studies. Here,

761 38 show very small DDGTS­U . These differences, however, are due to the fact that the DDGNU values at positions 35 and 38 are also abnormally small, suggesting that residual structures may exist in the unfolded state in this region of the sequence.14 The F values of Ala/Gly pair mutations To derive the structural information of transition states, it is more adequate to express the mutation effect on the folding rate in terms of F values rather  than DDGTS­U . Figure 5(b) shows the F values measured from Ala/Gly mutations, along with those from hydrophobic core mutations. The F values with DDGNU less than 0.6 kcal/mol were not included, since large uncertainties may arise in such cases.20,21 Mutations in helix I, the loop connecting the two middle helices, and the C-terminal region of helix IV, have very small F values, whereas other regions of the structure have much larger F values. Thus, F-value analysis lead to the same conclusion regarding the structures formed in the transition  state as the analysis of DDGTS­U does. The measured F values from the Ala/Gly mutations in helix II, III, and IV are fractional. In general, it is difficult to derive detailed structures of a transition state based on fractional F values. One possible interpretation for fractional F values is that there may be multiple different conformations in the transition state. Among them, some structures are folded at the mutation site while others are unfolded. Another possibility is that the F values arise from weakened interactions in the helical structures, presumably due to the distortion of helical conformations. Additional uncertainties can arise from the possibility that there may be nonnative interactions in the transition state. For example, it has been shown that the structure of the PUF2 mimic of Rd-apocyt b562 has broad nonnative interactions1 while the measured F values for the hydrophobic core residues in this intermediate (see Figure 5(c)) are in the normal range from 0 to 1. Non-native interactions have also been shown in computer simulation studies for transition states.22,23 The uncertainties in defining the transition state ensemble by F-value analysis may be reduced to some extent by constraints on the transition state obtained from other experiments. For example, the linear dependence of the logarithm of the folding rate as a function of denaturant concentration requires that the structures in the transition state ensemble have similar solvent-accessible surface areas. This is because if the structures in the transition state ensemble have very different solvent-accessible surface area, their free energies will change differently as the denaturant concentration is increased, which would lead to the redistribution of the population of the structures in the transition state ensemble. Those structures with more exposed surface area would become more populated in the transition state at high concentration of denaturant and a non-linear

DDGTS­U is defined as KRT ln(kf(Gly)/kf(Ala)) for each Ala/Gly pair mutation and KRT ln(kf(Mut)/ kf(WT)) for the hydrophobic core mutations. Both data sets indicate that there is little change in the activation free energy for the mutations throughout helix I, suggesting that helix I is unfolded in the rate-limiting transition state. This conclusion is also consistent with the result that the folding rates of the F65W mutants are the same for both the PUF2 mimic and the fully folded state (Figure 2), which indicates that helix I is unfolded in the rate-limiting  transition state. The DDGTSKU values of Ala/Gly mutations in helix III and IV also agree with those of hydrophobic core mutations. Mainly, helix III and the N-terminal region of helix IV have relatively  large DDGTSKU , suggesting that the secondary structures and side-chain interactions are formed in the transition state in these regions (Figure 5(a)).  There are some differences in the DDGTSKU values between the Ala/Gly mutations and hydrophobic core residues in helix II. While the hydrophobic core  residues in helix II generally have large DDGTSKU values, Ala/Gly pair mutations at positions 35 and

Units are sK1 for kf and ku; kcal/mol M for mf and mu; kcal/mol for DDGTSKU and DDGNU. DDGTSKU is calculated with KRT ln(kf(Gly)/  kf(Ala)); DDGNU is calculated with KRT ln[(ku(Gla)!kf(Ala))/(kf(Gly)!ku(Ala))]; F is calculated with DDGTSKU =DDGNU .

The mutants used to calculate the F values have mNU values ranging from 2.20 to 2.58 and mU values ranging from 0.88 to 1.27. The quality of our data is similar to those from other small proteins. For example, the wild-type CI2 has an mNU value of 1.90. The mNU values of the mutants range from 1.53 to 3.46. The mU of wild-type of CI2 is 1.31. The mU values of the mutants range from 0.96 to 1.60.29

dependence of the logarithm of the folding rate on denaturant concentrations would be expected. However, different structures with similar solventaccessible surface areas in the transition state are still possible. DDG  TS­U versus F for examining the role of each residue in kinetic folding In protein engineering studies, it is often assumed that residues with higher F values play key roles in initiating protein folding and constitute the folding nucleus. However, since the folding rate is directly controlled by the free energy difference between the transition state and the unfolded state, it can be argued that a residue that contributes more to the stability of the transition state is more important for the formation of the folding nucleus. Thus, depend ing on whether DDGTSKU or F values are used as criteria, the importance of a residue in forming the transition state may be assigned differently. This difference is clearly shown by comparing  Figure 5(a) and (b). For example, if DDGTSKU is used, hydrophobic core residues should play a more important role in forming the transition state or nucleus. However, if F is used, secondary structure formation appears to be more important,

since most of the large F values are from the mutations of the surface residues (Figure 5(b)). The different criteria in identifying important residues in a folding nucleus have implications in studying the effect of evolution on protein folding kinetics. For example, the relationship between F values and sequence conservation in homologous proteins has been sought in recent studies.24 It seems also reasonable to look for the relationship  between DDGTSKU and sequence conservation. Implications of the mutation results of Rd-apocyt b562 for F versus j-value analysis Recently, a j-value analysis has been used to characterize the structure of the transition state of ubiquitin, in which bi-His mutations on solventexposed residues and metal binding were used to perturb the structure of the transition state.25 The j-value analysis suggested that the structure formed in the transition state is significantly broader than that derived from F-value analysis based on the mutations of hydrophobic core residues.26 The causes for the different conclusions have been discussed from theoretical aspects, including the possible underestimation of the free energy change of the transition state in calculating

F values,26 non-native interactions,26 and the binding of His to Zn2C in the unfolded state.27 In the case of the rate-limiting transition state of Rd-apocyt b562, we observed that the F values measured from the Ala/Gly mutations of Rdapocyt b562 are larger than those measured from neighboring hydrophobic core mutations for the non-zero F values in Rd-apocyt b 562 (see Figure 5(b)). In addition, we found that most of the F values of the hydrophobic core residues in the PUF2 mimic are significantly smaller than 1 (see Figure 5(c)) even though the PUF2 mimic has welldefined secondary structures with all three helices folded.1,28 In this case, the smaller F values for the hydrophobic core residues are due to the fact that they are partially exposed in the intermediate and therefore may not be used to infer the formation of secondary structures. These results suggest a possible alternative interpretation for the difference observed in the F and j values of ubiquitin; i.e. the difference could be due to the fact that the F values are measured from hydrophobic core residues and reflect the hydrophobic core formation, whereas the j values are obtained for solvent-exposed residues and reflect the formation of secondary structures. Mutation effect on the unfolded state One of the concerns in using Ala/Gly mutations to study secondary structure formation is that such mutations may change the stability of the unfolded state. This is because the difference in the intrinsic propensities between Ala and Gly to form the helix is small. Therefore, a small change in the stability of the unfolded state can significantly affect the values of F and complicates the interpretation of the experimental results. The fact that all three mutations in helix I did not change the folding rate, which is consistent with the conclusion that helix I is not formed in the transition state, suggests that these mutations did not change the unfolded state significantly. It is obvious, however, that some other Ala side-chains may have formed additional interactions with other residues in either the fully folded or fully unfolded state, since Ala/Gly mutations at several positions have much smaller DDGN­U values (!0.5 kcal/mol) (see Table 1). Conclusion The rate-limiting transition state of Rd-apocyt b562 folds before the partially unfolded intermediate with the N-terminal helix unfolded and this hidden folding intermediate is on the folding pathway. The secondary structures formed in the rate-limiting transition state mainly include helix III and the N-terminal regions of helix II and IV. These results complement the earlier study and provide a more detailed description of the folding pathway of Rdapocyt b562 (Figure 6).
