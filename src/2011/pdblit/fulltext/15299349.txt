Abstract

The crystal structure of glutaminase-asparaginase from Acinetobacter glutaminas~'cans has been reinterpreted and refined to an R factor of 0.171 at 2.9 A resolution, using the same X-ray diffraction data that were used to build a preliminary model of this enzyme [Ammon, Weber, Wlodawer, Harrison, Gilliland, Murphy, Sj61in & Roberts (1988). J. Biol. Chem. 263, 150-156]. The current model, which does not include solvent, is based in part on the related structure of Escherichia coli asparaginase and is significantly different from the structure of the enzyme from A. glutaminasificans described previously. The reason for the discrepancies has been traced to insufficient phasing power of the original heavyatom derivative data, which could not be compensated for fully by electron-density modification techniques. The corrected structure of A. glutaminasificans glutaminase-asparaginase is presented and compared with the preliminary model and with the structure of E. coli asparaginase.
Introduction

Amidohydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of asparagine and/or glutamine to aspartic acid/glutamic acid, respectively. The glutaminase-asparaginase

isolated from Ac&etobacter glutaminasificans (AGA; Roberts, Holcenberg & Dolowy, 1970) belongs to the family of amidohydrolases that consist of chemically identical subunits related by 222 symmetry (Epp, Steigemann, Formanek & Huber, 1971; Roberts, Holcenberg & Dolowy, 1972; Ammon et al., 1983). These tetrameric enzymes have four active sites, each located between different lobes of adjacent subunits (Swain, Jask61ski, Housset, Rao & Wlodawer, 1993; Miller, Rao, Wlodawer & Gribskov, 1993) (Fig. 1). Tetrameric bacterial amidohydrolases from different sources have molecular weights of approximately 140000, share about 40% sequence similarity, have highly conserved regions around the active site and have similar affinity for their substrates (K,,= 10- 5 - 1 0 - 6 M; Wade, 1980). Because the tetrameric amidohydrolases have antitumor properties, some of these enzymes are used clinically for treatment of leukemias and lymphomas that are sensitive to asparagine depletion. Although AGA posseses antitumor activity (Roberts et al., 1970), it is not the enzyme of choice for therapeutic purposes because it has broad specificity for its substrates (Holcenberg & Roberts, 1977). On the other hand, the amidohydrolases from Escherichia coli (EcA) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ERA), which are more specific for asparagine, are used clinically for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Roberts, Schmid, Old & Stockert, 1976). For several years, our crystallographic investigations focused on an orthorhombic form of AGA because its asymmetric unit contains only one monomer and the 222 symmetry of the tetramer is expressed crystallographically (Wlodawer, Roberts & Holcenberg, 1977).

derivatives extending to 4.5-5.3 ~ resolution were collected and, as a result, AGA became the first amidohydrolase for which an atomic model was obtained (Ammon et al., 1988). That model, built before the AGA sequence (Tanaka et al., 1988) was known, will be referred to as AGA88. Because of the relatively low resolution of the X-ray data, particularly for the heavy-atom derivatives, AGA88 contained errors that could not be corrected without additional data. Unfortunately, new crystals of AGA, which would allow us to collect higher resolution data, could not be grown and the source of

AGA protein samples was no longer available. Thus, for several years AGA88 remained the only model of this enzyme. Nevertheless, AGA88 turned out to be invaluable for the solution of the structure of the first fully refined amidohydrolase, EcA. The crystallographic tetramer of AGA88 was used to locate the EcA tetramer in the asymmetric unit of its P21 unit cell by molecular replacement (MR), but was not sufficiently correct to allow for electron-density map interpretation or structure refinement. However, the MR phases revealed the heavy-atom sites of the only EcA heavy-atom derivative obtained (uranyl), which eventually became the primary source of EcA phases. Ultimately, the structural model of EcA was refined to an R factor of 0.145 at 2.3 A, resolution (Swain et al., 1993) and has been used as the M R model to revise the structure of AGA, as described below.

Structure determination procedures leading to AGA88
Experimental methods for the growth of orthorhombic AGA crystals and for X-ray data collection have been described by Ammon et al. (1988). The space group is I222 with unit-cell parameters a = 96.6, b = 112.5, c = 71.2A. The X-ray diffraction data set, collected on a Picker FACS-I diffractometer, consisted of 9413 reflections, 7403 of which were observed [F > 3o-(F)]. The heavy-atom derivative data were collected in a similar manner, and the results obtained from difference Patterson maps are summarized in Table 1. Phases were refined with the programs D I C K (Dickerson, Weinzierl & Palmer, 1968) and P R O T E I N (Steigemann, 1974). Electrondensity maps were calculated with multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phases to 4.7/k resolution and single isomorphous replacement (SIR)

phases between 4.7 and 4.0 A, resolution. Densitymodification techniques were used to enhance the maps and to extend the phases (Wang, 1985; Harrison, 1988). The resulting maps, and to a lesser extent the MIR/SIR map, were used to fit the preliminary model of AGA (AGA88).
Redetermination of the structure

Although the overall shape of the molecule and most of the secondary-structure elements were identified in AGA88, this model remained preliminary because of numerous errors in the linkages among these elements and/or improper chain direction. The current model of AGA (AGA94) (Fig. 2) is based on

AGA88 and the refined structure of EcA (Swain et al., 1993). The correct orientation of the AGA molecule in its unit cell was known from previous investigations (Ammon et al., 1988). The starting model used in the current investigations was prepared as follows. The Ca representation of one EcA subunit was manually superimposed on the AGA88 subunit located in the AGA unit cell with the program F R O D O (Jones, 1985). The fit was improved using the F R O D O option RIGID for 84 Ca pairs, and the entire model (including side chains) of the EcA subunit was superimposed. This model was

JACEK LUBKOWSKI et al. adjusted to the 2 F o - F c electron-density map that had been phased using the coordinates of AGA88. The model was refined with PROFFT (Hendrickson, 1985; Finzel, 1987), using all observed X-ray data, to an R factor of 0.34. The first stage of model rebuilding was followed by refinement with X - P L O R (Brfinger, Krukowski & Erickson, 1990), using a simulated-annealing strategy that lowered the R factor to 0.24 and yielded interpretable electrondensity maps. Next, over numerous cycles, the amino-acid sequence of the model was changed to the correct sequence of AGA (Tanaka et al., 1988) (the EcA subunit consists of 326 residues compared to 331 residues for AGA, Fig. 3). Because of the flexibility of some fragments of the A G A molecule i.e. the region between residues 10 and 35, the electron-density maps were not sufficiently clear to determine precisely their conformations. To decrease the model bias, we calculated several omit maps following grouped temperature-factor refinement (one B-factor value for main-chain atoms and one for side-chain and carbonyl O atoms per residue) with X - P L O R . Using P R O F F T , we refined the final model (AGA94), which is comprised of 331 protein residues but no solvent, to an R factor of 0.171 for all X-ray intensity data with F > 3o-(F) between 2.9 and 10.0 A resolution. The weighting scheme used is that recommended in the P R O F F T manual. Weights were applied to the data to give only very slightly higher weight to the higher resolution reflections. A summary of the final refinement statistics is given in Table 2.*

was built into density that actually belongs to the N-terminal domain of a symmetry-related subunit. In AGA88, there are two crossovers between domains within the subunit, in contrast to the single linker indentified in AGA94 (Fig. 2). One of the connections in AGA88 follows the path of the linking strand in AGA94 and the other one is perpendicular to it. There is also a loop from the C-terminal domain of AGA88 that follows the interdomain linker of AGA94 and subsequently turns back into the C-terminal domain. Thirteen secondary-structure elements were identified in AGA88 from the modified electron-density maps (Wang, 1985; Harrison, 1988), whereas 24 a-helices and /3-strands are recognized in AGA94 (Fig. 4). Partly because of incorrect connections between the secondary-structure elements of AGA88, most of these have been traced in the opposite direction when compared with AGA94. Although the topology of some of the secondary-structure elements was described correctly in AGA88, distribution of these elements along the linear amino-acid chain is also much different from AGA94 because of errors in connectivities. Of 331 residues, 70 were modeled correctly; 121 were modeled in the correct topology, but in the wrong direction and 140 residues had no correspondence with the correct model. A comparison of the main-chain torsion angles between AGA88 and AGA94 is illustrated with Ramachandran plots (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) in Fig. 5. In the case of AGA88, the (q~,0) values are scattered, whereas for AGA94 only two non-glycine residues (Thr200 and His300) are located far from the allowed regions of the Rama-

Comparison of AGA94 with AGA88
Although both models were created on the basis of the same X-ray intensity data, the limited extent of phasing and lack of information from models of other asparaginase structures prevented significant improvement of AGA88. AGA88 featured the correct overall shape and many of the secondarystructure elements of the molecule (Fig. 3 in Ammon et al., 1988); however, one subunit consisted of two polypeptide chains comprised of 331 residues, arranged in two domains. None of the four loose ends of AGA88 correlate with the N or C termini of AGA94. Three of the ends are located near the ends of secondary-structure elements, where the density had not been clear enough to continue the trace. The remaining terminus ends a stretch of sequence that * Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Reference: IAGX, R1AGXSF).

These results support have not been clear even in the final stages of AGA88 as the best possible model that could be refinement. The paucity of electron density in these areas is likely due to a combination of the flexibility obtained from the data available at the time.

AGA94, although it is known that some of them Only the MR and final 21=o - Fc maps (panels D and play a significant role in creating the active-site E) possess continuous density along the backbone of constellations of EcA and ErA. Taking these remarks into account, we can make a the correct model, AGA94. As observed previously (Ammon et al., 1988), some of the density in the few general conclusions on the structure of the surface regions was removed by the use of automa- active-site region of AGA.

from the crystallographic data of the presence of a ligand bound in the AGA active site, as in the cases of EcA and ErA, where aspartate or sulfate ligands are bound. Thus, it is not surprising that the activesite geometries may differ in detail.

The published model of A. glutaminasificans glutaminase-asparaginase, AGA88, was based on low-resolution data from native crystals, and even lower resolution data from heavy-atom derivative crystals. Because of the limitations of the data, AGA88 contained errors that prevented it from being a sufficient starting model in the solution of the structures of other asparaginases. Additional information was necessary to accurately phase the AGA data, but because it was not possible to collect more experimental information, we pursued the structures of closely related enzymes from different bacterial sources. The topological information obtained from the other asparaginases, along with the incorporation of the amino-acid sequence of AGA, produced better electron-density maps using the original X-ray diffraction data. This approach led to an improved and significantly different model, AGA94. The secondary-structure elements and their linkages have been verified, or redefined, resulting in a much better fit to the electron-density maps. Although the active-site information from AGA94 is limited, a wealth of topological information has been gained, establishing the identical fold of asparaginases and glutaminase-asparaginases. This information will be used in a comparative study of the structures of amidohydrolases. The results presented here offer a good example of how a comprehensive study of a family of closely related proteins can provide information about every member of this family, even if the data for the individual members are not sufficient for this purpose.
