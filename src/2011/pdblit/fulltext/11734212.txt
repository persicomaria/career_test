The structure of the complex of bovine trypsin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor has been determined by crystal structure analysis at 2.8 A resolution. The structure is closely similar to the model predicted from the structures of the components. The complex is a tetrahedral adduct with a covalfent bond between the carbonyl carbon of Lys-151 of the inhibitor and the y-oxygen of Ser-195 of the enzyme. The imidazole of His-57 is hydrogen-bonded to' Asp-102 and the bound seryl y-oxygen in accord with the histidine being charged. The negatively charged carbonyl oxygen of Lys-151 farms two hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogens of Gly-193 and Ser-195. Protonation of the leaving group N-H of Alarequires a conformational change of the imidazole 161 to form an acyl-complex of His-57. The tetrahedral adduct is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between groups at the leaving group side and inhibitor and enzyme, which would be weakened in the acyl-enzyme. The kinetic data of inhibitor-enzyme interaction are reconciled with the structural model, and relations between enzyme-inhibitor are proposed. interaction and productive enzymesubstrate interaction

1. Introduction
There is evidence from functional and kinetic data that enzymia catalysis is involved in the interaction of natural proteinase inhibitors with proteinases (for a review, see Laskowski & Sealock, 1971). The structure determination of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor indeed showed that this inhibitor resembles an ideal substrate at its reactive site and suggested explanations for some of its functional properties (Huber et al., 1970,197la). The structure determination of a natural inhibitor-proteinase complex should yield the structure characteristic for a particular step of the catalytic mechanism and perhaps explain both why this structure is stable and its relation to the whole catalytic mechanism. Of further interest is the extremly high association of energy of the components

with I<,,, > 10r4, corresponding to an association energy higher than 19 kcal/mol (Vincent & Lazdunski, 1972). Furthermore, the well known structures of the components should allow an analysis The large amount of information available of structural alterations upon association. about the structure of the serine proteinases and their complexes with small inhibitors was essential for the stereochemical and functional interpretation of the structure of the complex (Blow, 1971; Hartley & Shotton, 1971; Stroud et al., 1971). A detailed atomic model of the complex between the inhibitor and cr-chymotrypsin has already been proposed on the basis of the atomic structures of the inhibitor and cr-chymotrypsin. These models were compared using the information about the inhibitor active site and the positions of small molecule inhibitors in a-chymotrypsin (Blow et al., 1972). The actual structure determination of the complex proved that the proposed model is essentially correct. The alterations are minor and could scarcely have been predicted from model-building studies, but they appear to provide important implications on the inhibitor action and the enzyme mechanism. This paper describes the structure analysis and the structure of the complex at the contact site area.

2. Experimental
The preparation and crystallization of the complex was as described previously (Riihlmann et al., 1971). The saturated magnesium sulphate solution used for crystallization was exchanged for a 2-5 M-potassium/sodium phosphate solution of pH 7. The crystal modification is orthorhombic with space group 1222 and lattice constants a, 75.7 A; b, 84.4 A and c, 122.9 A, containing 8 molecules per unit cell. The distinction between the members of the pair 1222 and 12,Z12, was made through the analysis of the difference Patterson functions of the heavy atom derivatives. Recently we became aware of other crystal modifications obtained under different crystallization conditions (Cole & Parthasarathy, 1973). One of these has a and b lattice constants within the limits of error identical to ours, but a slightly smaller c axis and a lower symmetry with space group P212,2,. Data were collected with both diffractometer and film methods. All data for the native on a modified Siemens diffractometer with focus crystals were collected to 2.8 A resolution to crystal, and crystal to detector distances of 37 cm and 38 cm, respectively, using an w - 29 scan. Friedel pairs were measured. These data were corrected for absorption by an empirical method (Huber & Kopfmann, 1969). The R-factor, defined as R = zJi - g/ CJi for symmetry equivalent reflexions was R = 0.09. J, is the intensity of an individual measurement. J is the average value. The summation is overall measurements. Data of the heavy atom derivatives were determined largely by the screenless precession technique. The precession cameras used had a crystal to focus distance of 30 cm, the film to crystal distance was 7.5 cm. Graphite monochromatized CuKcr radiation was used. The collimator apertures were 0.4 mm or 0.3 mm, i.e. smaller than the crystal cross-sections. The relative merits of a 6.ne collimation in the diffraction experiment lie in the small size of the reflexions relaxing the reflexion overlap problem, and in the possibility of using a simple absorption correction procedure described recently (Schwager et al., 1973). The crystals were mounted with the long c-axis coinciding with the spindle axis. The precession angle was 1.5". Photographs were made in 2.5" intervals for the spindle dial setting from 0" to about 80". The crystal setting was checked and eventually corrected after each photograph, i.e. every 12 to 20 h. 5 to 10 intensity photographs could be obtained intensity from 1 crystal until radiation damage effect became severe. 1300 to 1900 measurable reflexions could be obtained from each photograph. A typieal example is: from 2600 reflexions on a photograph, 360 are overlapped and 500 lie on the edge, so that 1740 automatic densitometer and processed remain. These films were scanned on an Optronics

using programmes of Xuong & Freer (1971) modified by one of us (P. Schwager, unpublished results). From each derivative about 53,000 individual measurements were obtained within the 2.5 -4 resolution sphere. This means that each of the 14,000 independent reflexions has been measured on the average up to 4 times. Within the 2.8 A resolution limit, approximately 600 reflexions for each derivative were missing, largely due to systematic absences caused by the rotation about 1 axis only. These w'ere measured on the diffractometer. The R-factors (defined as above) summed over-all measurements of a particular derivative after absorption correction ranged from 0.07 to 0.09. It is interesting to note that an individual photographic measurement appears to be not worse than a diffractometer measurement. The R-values for symmetry-related reflexions on a particular photograph ranged from about 0.05 to 0.07. The photographic data of a particular derivative were scaled together using a method and programmes by W. Steigemann (unpublished results). factor is determined for each photograph by making A scale factor and "temperature" use of the common reflexions on different photographs. The same procedure was applied to the diffractometer data of the native crystals. Here common scaling reflexions were measured for each crystal. The heavy atom derivatives described in Table 1 were prepared by soaking the crystals in appropriate heavy metal-containing phosphate buffer. The heavy atom positions were determined from 3-dimensional difference Patterson functions and refined by difference Fourier techniques and a cyclic least-squares procedure (Dickerson et al., 1961). Table 1 shows clearly that all derivatives have a large number of occupations. Some of these appear to be clusters, which could only be resolved partially. The various criteria of refinement listed in Table 2 show that no derivative is of truly satisfactory quality. Phases were calculated including the anomalous dispersion effects of potassium tetracyanoplatinate, dipyridinium-tetrachloroplatinate, acetaminophenylmercuryacetate and selected data from the other derivatives. A Wilson plot was calculated to determine the absolute scale factor and temperature factor. The over-all temperature factor is 37 AZ. The numbers shown in Table 1 are based on this absolute scale factor. The standard deviation of the electron density was calculated to be 0.08 e/A". A Fourier synthesis at 2.8 if resolution was calculated using a grid of 1.3 A x 1.4 b x 1.0 A and drawn on foils with a contour line separation of 0.08 e/A3. The first contour line was at 0.1 e/As. A model of the contact site of the inhibitor and trypsin comprising a volume of about 20 X 20 x 20 A3 was constructed using an optical comparator (Richards 1968). The atomic positions were marked on the sheets of the Fourier map. Where model and in accord, we were influenced by the density. This co-ordinate density were not entirely set was then treated by a model-building procedure to introduce the proper geometric of a polypeptide chain (Diamond, 1966). The average atomic shifts were restrictions 0.7 A. This set of atomic co-ordinates was fitted to the electron density by a real space procedure (Diamond, 1971). The average co-ordinate shifts after 2 cycles were refinement 0.4 A. described here, we did not make use of the full In these early stages of the refinement potential of the programme, but an inspection of the shifts showed that the corresponeverywhere. dence between model and electron density improved The Lys- 151-Ala-161 amide of the inhibitor provided a particular problem for the real space refinement, as the lysine carbonyl carbon is tetrahedral with 2 oxygens bound to it. We made 2 attempts to refine this group using the standard pe.ptide group with the carbonyl oxygen pointing "up" and "down", respectively, in the directions of the 2 oxygens. In a third round we attached 2 oxygens at the carbon atom simulating a tetrahedral carbon but leaving the bond angles and bond length of the standard peptide group unaltered and allowing rotation around the C-N bond. The 3 resulting co-ordinate sets differed only slightly. The "tetrahedral" co-ordinate set was used for the distance calculations discussed later. It should be pointed out, however, that the refinement process does not take into account the stereochemistry of non-bonded interactions. Our interpretation of stereochemical details of the structural model is, therefore, also based on the strrretures of the compo-

nents which we know with higher accuxacy than the complex. The inhibitor structure is crystallographically refined at 1.5 A resolution (J. Deisenhofer & W. Steigemann, unpublished results). cr-Chymotrypsin has been used for this comparison as a substitute for the trypsin data, which became available to us only very recently. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are closely similar, in particular in the vicinity of the catalytic site (Stroud et al., 1971). cc-Chymotrypsin has been determined at 2 A resolution (Birktoft & Blow, 1972). The co-ordinate sets of the component structures were oriented to the complex model by minimizing the distances between the backbone atoms at the contact area (W. Steigemann, unpublished results). 19 and 18 amino acids were used for orienting the inhibitor respectively. The average differences in position between all atoms and cr-chymotrypsin, in the model involved in these calculations and those in the individual components were 0.66 A and 0.67 A for inhibitor and chymotrypsin, respectively. These values are remarkably small compared with similar calculations on other protein structures. We feel that they are more indicative of the inherent errors in the structure determinations, than of actual structural differences or alterations. They might help in evaluating the atomic distances discussed later. Based on these figures we observed no significant structural atoms in the contact area of the component molecules upon comchange of the backbone

u-Chymotrypsin has been analyzed in its two forms, the acylakted and the native structure. These differ essentially in the position of the Oy oxygen of Ser-195, one being transformed to the other by a rotation of the oxygen around the Cc+-($3 bond through about 120" (Birktoft $ Blow, 1972; Henderson, 1970). These two oxygen positions are demonstrated in the lower half of Figure 6. Number 1 characterizes the position of Oy in the native enzyme and number 2 the bound position, as found in

the acyl-chymotrypsins, tosyl and indoleacryloyl-chymotrypsin. The upper half of Figure 6 shows the corresponding segment of the complex molecule. The oxygen is clearly in the bound position. Figure 3(a) shows that the density at seryl Oy in the bound position exceeds two contour lines, while there is no density observed at the native position of Oy. The Oy position demonstrated in the complex model (Figs 3(b) and 6) is therefore highly significant. Another essential feature is the Lys-151-Ala-161 bond. It is clear from Figure 3(a) and the corresponding model fit Figure 3(b) that there is a covalent C-N link between these two amino acids. An essential difference between the structures of the tosyl-inhibited chymotrypsin and the complex appears to be the orientation of the imidazole of His-57, in particular their C/K--Cy rotations (Figs 7 and 8). The histidine orientation of native chymotrypsin differs only very slightly from that in the tosyl form.

Within the complex N&2 of His-57 is directed towards the Oy <ofSer-195, while in tosyl-chymotrypsin it is directed towards a water molecule hyd.rogen-bonded to it and an oxygen of the sulphonyl group (Birktoft & Blow, 1972). The same holds for the other acyl-chymotrypsin whose structure has been determined, indoleacryloylchymotrypsin (Henderson, 1970). This structural difference is also reilected in the various distances: N.z~ of His-57 (complex) to Oy Ser-195 (complex), 3.4 A, while it is 3.9 A in the tosyl-enzyme. The distance of NE2 to the nitrogen atom of Ala-161 in the complex is 4.4 A. A hydrogen bond between N61 of His-57 and Asp-102 appears tot exist in both structures, the distances being 2.7 A and 3.2 A for tosyl-chymotrypsin and the complex, respectively, although it is obviously more linear in chymotrypsin.

We are aware of the difficulty in defining precisely the orientation of aromatic rings in Fourier maps, but there are also stereochemical grounds to believe that the difference in histidine orientation described for chymotrypsin and the complex is real. Except for the seryl Oy there is no other hydrogen-bond acceptor at a reasonable distance from N&2 (57) within the complex. The N of Ala-161 is too far away at 4.4 8. This distance would decrease by only 0.3 A assuming the imida.zole orientation and position to be as found in chymotrypsin. In chymotrypsin, however (tosyl, indoleacryloyl and native forms), a water molecule is hydrogen bonded t,o Ne2 (57) (Henderson, 1970), which might cause the imidazole to swing round. Figure 8 shows that the up oxygen atom of the tetrahedral carbon of Lys-151 does not coincide with the independently refined Oy of Ser-195. The distance from the tetrahedral carbon to Oy is 2-O A. This is too long for a covalent bond, but appears to be within the limits of the error in the co-ordinates. Furthermore, the atoms of the Lys-151, Ala-161 groups may be shifted easily by 0.5 A from their positions obtained in the refinement towards Ser-195, their fit to the electron density becoming even slightly better.

Figure 9 shows the complex structure at the catalytic site but with the Lys-151Ala-161 amide as obtained by fitting the native inhibitor co-ordinates to the complex data as described before. Figure 9 should be compared with Figure 8. The Lys-151 oxygen position is only a few tenths of an A unit away from the position of the down oxygen in Figure 8. The seryl Oy is almost perpendicular to the plane of the trigonal carbon of Lys-151. This is important for later discussion. The down (charged) oxygen at the tetrahedral carbon of Lys-151 is 2.4 A and 3.4 A away from the amide nitrogens of Gly-193 and Ser-195, respectively, forming hydrogen bonds with both. The inhibitor chain Pro-131 to Lys-151 forms a short segment of antiparallel /3structure with the enzyme chain with hydrogen bonds N-H Lys-151 to C-O Ser214 (2.8 A) and C-O Pro-131 to N-H Gly-216 (3.4 A).

At the leaving group side there is a hydrogen bond formed between the amide nitrogen of Arg-171 and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe-41 with a distance of 3.4 A. The carbonyl oxygen of Ala-161 forms a hydrogen bond with the side&chain amide group of Cm-192. Residue 192 is a methionine in chymotrypsm and this type of int,erantion cannot occur. The Lys-151 side chain is in the specificity pocket of the enz,yme, making a salt bridge with Asp-189 (25 A) (Fig. 4( a) and (b)). It is interesting to note that the middle segment of the Lys-161 side chain is not observable in the electron density map, while Cz, Cp and NC are clearly defined. This signifies a certain flexibility of the side chain, which is not in the fully extended conformation and is anchored at both ends. The listing of Van der Waals' interactions proposed in our tentative model of the complex has to be modified only slightly (Table 2 in Blow et al., 1972). The interaction of the Arg-391 side chain of the inhibitor with the enzyme cannot be strong as it is barely visible. Arg-171, on the other hand, interacts strongly and specifically through its guanidinium group with the side-chains of Tyr-39 and Tyr-151 and the main-chain carbonyl of His-40. As already proposed, there is no fixed water observable in the contact of inhibitor and enzyme. Both molecules fit so tightly that there would be indeed no space for water between them. There is also no indication of fixed water molecules in the specificity binding pocket of the enzyme, although there appears to be room for it. It might be mobile, as observed for the middle segment of the lysine side chain.

4. Discussion
(a) Involvement of enzymic catalysis in inhibitor action There are some observations which strongly suggest that enzymic catalysis is involved in inhibitor-proteinase interaction. In many inhibitors the presence of a susceptible peptide bond has been demonstrated, which is split by catalytic quantities of proteinases until an equilibrium between the native inhibitor and its modified forms is reached (Finkenstadt & Laskowski, 1965). The modified forms have the susceptible peptide bond split. The complexes obtained from both forms of these inhibitors are indistinguishable (Laskowski & Sealock, 1971). With pancreatic trypsin inhibitor no modified form has been observed except after cleavage of the Cys-14-Cys-381 disulfide (Wilson & Laskowski, 1971; Rigbi, 1971). We attributed this to a particular stabilization of the Lys-151-Ala-161 amide bond due to strong interactions with the neighbouring polypeptide chain (Huber et al., 1971b). (b) The stable enzyme-inhibitor complex, a tetrahedral adduct It has been demonstrated above that the Oy oxygen atom of Ser-195 has a position within the complex characteristic for an acyl-enzyme with a covalent bond between enzyme and inhibitor. There is also clearly a covalent bond between Lys-151 and Ala-161 within the complex. The only stable structure with C-N and C-O bonds appears to be a tetrahedral adduct. The different orientations of the imidazole ring of His-57 within the complex as compared with tosyl or native chymotrypsin are important for understanding the stabilization of the tetrahedral adduct. In the complex, N&2 (57) interacts with 0~

of Ser-195, which is covalently linked to C of Lys-151. This observation is consistent with the seryl proton being transferred to His-57 upon covalent bond formation (Henderson et al., 1971). The covalently linked seryl Oy stillactsas a potent hydrogenbond acceptor. The orientation and position of His-57 in the complex allows the seryl Oy to rotate from its native position and form the tetrahedral adduct without changing the Oy-N&2 contact distance by more than 0.3 A. This preserves the hydrogen bond and effectively lowers the energy of the transition state of the reaction. The histidine orientation found in tosyl, indoleacryloyl and native chymotrypsin is probably influenced by the external water molecule and may be characteristic for the deacylation step. This water molecule is presumably in a position required for deacylation (Henderson, 1970). The distance of 4.4 A between the N of Ala-161 and Ne2 of His-57 and the improper orientation of the imidazole is prohibitive for a direct proton transfer to form the acyl-complex. A structural rearrangement of the imidazole, rotations around &-C/3 and C/I--C+, are required to bring N&2 closer t,o the N of alanine. The interaclion between the seryl Oy and N.Y~ (57) must be weakened in the course of this structural transition, as does the N61-Asp-102 interaction. The analysis of the chymotrypsin-catalysed hydrolysis of various amides and the presence of a kinetic nitrogen isotope effect have suggested that k,,, is dominated by the rate determining breakdown of a tetrahedral intermediate (Fersht & Requena, 1971; O'Leary 85Kluetz, 1970; see also Hess, 1971). This is in accord with the structural features as found in the complex. There is a controversy, however, as to whether the tetrahedral intermediate accumulates or not (Caplow, 1969; Fersht, 1972). The down oxygen of the tetrahedral carbon of Lys-151 carries a formal negative charge. This charge may be partially compensated as the oxygen accepts two hydrogen bonds from the amide nitrogens Gly-193 and Ser-195, respectively. Fitting t.he native inhibitor structure to the complex co-ordinates might give an idea of how the loose complex (Michaelis complex) looks, although formation of the tetrahedral adduct is probably accompanied by a slightly closer approach of enzyme and inhibitor, apart from the structural alterations in enzyme and inhibitor already discussed. This is shown in Figure 9, which clearly demonstrates, on comparison with Figure 8, that the Lys-151 carbonyl oxygen largely retains its position on covalent bond formation in the tetrahedral adduct. The hydrogen bond to the amide N of Gly-193 may be stronger, due to a longer C-O bond in the tetrahedral adduct. The seryl Oy approaches approximately perpendicular to the trigonal carbon atom of Lys-151 and a covalent bond is formed by further approach of both atoms, the carbon atom becoming tetrahedral. This is indeed the minimum structural alteration required for formation of the tetrahedral adduct, thus effectively making the energy of the transition state of the reaction low.
(c) Possible relation between inhibitor binding interaction and productive enzyme-substrate

Water is totally excluded from the inhibitor-enzyme contact area. There is no electron density observable that could be ascribed to a bound water molecule, nor is there sufficient space between the two components to accommodate a water molecule. However, binding of a substrate chain only leaves the imidazole of His-57 accessible to water. The hydrogen bond formed by t,he imidazole with the bound Ser-195

Oy in the tetrahedral adduct is weak, the hi&dine may undergo the conformational change required to protonatie the leaving group, so that the reaction proceeds to the acyl-complex. The inhibitor chain Tyr-351 to Cys-381 and the bulky disulfide Cys-14-Cys-381 exclude water from the enzyme surface making the hydrogen bonds strong, His-57 immobile and the transition state for the histidine conformational change energetically unfavourable. A further reason for the imidazole orientation found in the complex might be crowding of N&2 (57) and the C/3of Cys-141 (Fig. 10). The distance between these two atoms is 4.5 A and would have to considerably shorten on the structural t.ransition of the histidine. A normal substrate chain presumably has more flexibility.

In addition to these arguments of an unfavourable transition stsLtefor acylation in the compl.ex, there appears to exist a particular stabilization of the tetrahedral adduct. N-H of Ala-161 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-36I, which is the first hydrogen bond of the twisted pleated-sheet structure of -the inhibitor. This favourable interaction would hardly be possible in the acyl-complex, which requires a shift of 1.5 H of the Ala-161 nitrogen relative to Lys-151. Furthermore, the Ca, Cfl and C, 0 atoms of Ala-16I make hydrophobic and hydrogenbinding interactions with the enzyme !hat would probably also be weakened upon C-N bond deavage and acyl-enzyme formation. Specificity at the leaving group side for peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin has been demonstrated and shown to be in accord with the tentative model of the complex (A. Fersht, D. Blow & 5. Fastrez, unpublished results),

(d) Association energy The association constant of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with trypsin at neutral pH is >101*, one of the highest values ever determined for protein-protein interaction (Vincent & Lazdunski, 1972). Part of this association energy comes from Van der Waals' and hydrophobic interactions already listed in Table 2 of Blow et al. (1972), with the slight alterations mentioned before. The hydrogen bonds and salt linkages between inhibitor and enzyme illustrated in Figure 10 contribute to the binding energy. They are particularly strong in the water-free environment of the contact area. The covalent bond formation leading to the tetrahedral adduct might also strengthen the association. A fourth contribution became clear recently in the course of the very high-resolution analysis and crystallographic refinement of the inhibitor structure (J. Deisenhofer & W. Steigemann, unpublished results). The Lys-15I-Ala-161 amide is strained, as signified by their T-angles. These are 121" and 98", respectively, the largest deviations from the normal tetrahedral angle of 109" in the molecule. As non-planar amide groups have not yet been introduced in the refinement process, these T-angles may well be artifacts caused by a non-planar lysine-alanine amide group, which could even be distorted towards a tetrahedral C atom. The energy required for such distortions appears to be low (Winkler & Dunitz, 1971). The structure determination of the inhibitor molecule within the complex is far less accurate at the present state, so that a direct comparison of the r-angles cannot yet be made. It is obvious from model building, however, that the strain may easily be relieved in a tetrahedral lysinealanine linkage group due to the possible rotation around the C-N bond. The association constant is strongly pH-dependent (Laskowski et al., 1971). It still decreases below pH 2. While the low pH decrease might be a consequence of the conformational changes observed in trypsin (Lazdunski & Delaage, 1967), the decrease from pH 7 to pH 5 may well be governed by the ionization of His-57 of the enzyme, which would oppose the formation of the tetrahedral adduct. The complex crystals are stable to about pH 3. A comparison of X-ray photographs showed that marked conformational changes occur below about pH 4, compared to pH 7 crystals, resulting in large intensity and lattice constant changes. pH 5 crystals, however, show only subtle intensity changes in accord with a slight structural rearrangement of one or only a few residues. (e) Generalization to other rmtwal proteinase inhibitors

Due to the structural similarity of the serine proteinases, there is little doubt that their complexes with pancreatic trypsin inhibitor are all closely similar. In fact, the tentative model of the complex has been obtained from the structures of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and u-chymotrypsin. A generalization to other inhibitors is far less obvious, but the similarity between the pH dependences of the association constants and the association and dissociation rate constants of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and soya bean trypsin inhibitor is in favour of it (Laskowski et al., 1971; Luthy et al., 1973; Vincent & Lazdunski, 1972; Putter, 1967 ; J. Engel, personal communication). Mainly due to experimental difficulties, little further is known about the kinetics of the interaction of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with trypsin. Soya bean trypsin inhibitor-trypsin interaction, on the other hand, has been studied carefully and we may relate these data to the structural

principles of the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-trypsin complex. But we wish to emphasize that this interpretation should be treated cautiously. Laskowski and co-workers (Laskowski et al., 1971; Luthy et al., 1973) proposed a minimum mechanism for the soya bean trypsin inhibitor-trypsin interaction : I+EF+TE,:&*E,~I*+E, IL-z k--j KL EL*

where I is the native inhibitor, I* the modified inhibitor with the susceptible peptide bond split, E the enzyme and C the stable complex. IE, and I*E, are the loose, non-covaIent complexes. It is clear that a tetrahedral adduct C is not symmet,rical with respect to its formation from I and I*, as, apart from other processes, one covalent bond has to be made starting with I and two bonds have to be closed and one group excised starting wit.h I*. k, is the rate constant for the conversion of the loose complex IE, to the tetrahedral adduct. It is about two orders of magnitude higher than kcst for peptide substrates. This is qualitatively as expected, as k,,, is governed by the breakdown of a tetrahedral adduct as the rate-limiting step in peptide hydrolysis (O'Leary & Kluetz, 1970; Fersht & Requena, 1971; Fersht, 1972). k, decreases from pH 8 to pH 6 in accord with the ionization of His-57 (Laskowski et al., 1971; Luthy et al., 1973) .This is in accord with L, characterizing the base-catalyzed attack of the Ser-195 Oy to form the tetrahedral adduct. Below pH 6, a plateau is reached which has not yet been explained. k _ 2, the rate constant for the conversion of C into IE,, is very small at neutral pH, increasing steeply with decreasing pH. k,, the rate constant for the conversion of C into I*E,, is more than an order of magnitude smaller than k- 2, but has an analogous pH dependence. In a tetrahedral adduct C, kmZ and possibly k, characterize the acidcatalyzed breakdown of the tetrahedral adduct involving proton transfer from His57 to the covalently linked seryl Oy-195 and the N-H of the leaving group, respectively, and should, therefore, be governed by histidine protona,tion. Below pH 5, k-, and k, increase further, possibly due to conformational transitions of trypsin. If this assignment of k, is correct, it is reasonable that k-, > k, (Laskowski et al., 1971), because protonation of the leaving group N-H requires: the conformational transition of His-57 as described before.
