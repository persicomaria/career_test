Although matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in breast cancer progression, the contribution of MMP-1 and MMP-3 to this process, has not been thoroughly investigated. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important at several points during multistage neoplastic progression, lmmunohistochemistry (Strept-ABC-HRP method) and in situ hybridization were performed to detect MMP-1, MMM-3 proteins, and MMP-3 mRNA, respectively, in 77 infiltrative breast carcinomas. MMP-1, MMP-3 protein, and MMP-3 mRNA detection were analyzed in parallel with clinicopathologic features (menopausal status, histological type, nuclear and histological grade, stage) and the immunohlstochemical reactivity of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) receptors, and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein in breast carcinomas. Statistical analysis was performed using the multiple linear regression test. Immunoreactivity for MMP-1 and MMP-3 was observed in 59 of 77 (77%) and 22 of 77 (28.5%) breast carcinomas and was evaluated separately in cancer cells and in stromal fihroblasts. MMP-3 mRNA was detected in 72 of 77 (93.5%) carcinomas exclusively in stromal cells within the tumors or in the marginal portion of tumors. MMP-1 protein immunoreactivity in stromal fibroblasts but n o t in cancer cells showed a statistically significant correlation with tumor stage (P = .04). MMP-1 reactivity either in stromal or in cancer cells showed a statistically significant inverse correlation with PR expression (P = .04 and P = .04, respectively). MMP-3 protein immunoreactivity in cancer or stromal cells and MMP-3 mRNA expression was not associated with the clinicopathologic features studied. MMP-3 mRNA was detected more often in ductal carcinomas. These results indicate that MMP-1 may contribute to breast cancer invasiveness. Furthermore, they suggest differential functions for MMP-1 and MMP-3 in breast cancer progression. HUM PATI-IOL 30:436-442. Copyright © 1999 byW.B.

Enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix is an essential step in tumor invasion and metastasis) Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading individual components of the ECM and with overlapping specificity. Members of the MMP family include the collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13), the gelatinases (gelatinase A [MMP-2] and gelatinase B [MMP-9]), the stromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10), and matrilysin (MMP-7), which degrade a broad spectrum of substrates, including proteoglycans, laminin, fibronectin, and some collagen species. Finally, stromelysin-3 (MMP-11), metalloelastase (MMP-12), and MMP-14, a membrane-type MMP that appears to have more restricted substrate specificity, are also members of this family2,3 Interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), the enzyme with the broadest substrate specificity, are of particular importance in tumor progression. Like all members of the MMP family, the activity of

MMP-1 and MMP-3 is regulated at various levels, including transcription, secretion as inactive proenzymes termed zymogens, activation, and inhibition by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. 4 MMP-3 expression is regulated primarily at the level of transcription. 4 The promoter of the gene responds to different regulators, including platelet-derived growth factor-beta and interleukin-l.5,6 The activation of pro-MMP-1 and p r o MMP-3 proceeds in a similar stepwise processing manner. MMP-3 plays a critical role in the late activation events ofpro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3. 7 MMP-1 and MMP-3 have been detected in various connective tissues in normal processes such as wound healing and pathological settings, s,9 In the m a m m a r y gland, MMP-3 is involved in branching morphogenesis and postlactational involution. 10,11 The mammary glands from transgenic mice that overexpress MMP-3 are both functionally and morphologically altered by supernumerary branches and progressively fibrotic stroma prone to the development ofneoplasias, u Furthermore, expression of MMP-3 is low during lactation, whereas it is strongly upregulated after weaning, coinciding with start of the collapse of the lobulo-alveolar structures and the intensive remodeling observed in involution) ° Increased expression of MMP-1 or MMP-3 has been observed in several types of h u m a n cancers, including cholangiocarcinomas, 12gastric) 3 pancreatic and ampullary, TM esophageal, 15 and pulmonary carcinomas. 16 In some of these tumors, the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 was associated with an agressive phenotype) 2,1~

The antibody against MMP-3 (Clone 55-2A4) is also refered to as clone B. The antibodies were raised using hybridoma technology in Phorbol 12Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA)-treated HT 1080 cells and recognize both latent and active MMP-1 and MMP-3. The CB-11 monoclonal antibody (Bio-Genex, San Ramon, CA) at a dilution of 1:!50 was applied for the detection of c-erbB-2. Finally, the ER-ICA and PR-ICA kits (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) were used for the detection Of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). After additional rinsing in PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated antimouse secondary antibody (Dakopatts, Denmark) for 30 minutes, at room temperature, and then incubated with strept-ABC-HRP for 30 minutes. Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride 0.06% in PBS, containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide, was used as the chromogen. The sections wer e counterstained with Harris's hematoxyiin. Positive controls included skin with epidermal ulcers for MMP-1 and MMP-3 and breast cancer tissue with known immunoreactivity for ER, PR, and c-erbB-2. Negative controls had the primary antibodies omitted and replaced by PBS. Semiquanfitative estimation based on the staining intensity and relative abundance of immunoreactive cells was performed independently by two pathologists. The fraction of MMP-1, and MMP-3-positive stained cells was scored after having examined 10 high-power fields (400X) of one section for each sample and the percentage of MMP-1- and MMP-3positive cells was the average of the positive cells of 10 fields. Immunoreactivity was evaluated as follows: Staining intensit,/was compared with control (1+ week, 2+ moderate, and 3+ strong). The extent of positive cells was scored using a scale of 0 to 3. A score of 0 was given if fewer than 10% of positive cells were detected in 10 high-power fields; score 1 if 10% to 20% were detected; score 2 if21% to 50% of cells were positive; and score 3 if more than 50% of cells were positive per 10 high-power fields. Staining for ER and PR was evaluated semiquantitatively using the H score system (0 = negative [0 to 50], 1 = mild reactivity [51 to 100], 2 = moderate [101 t o 200], 3 = strong reactivity [201 to 300]). The fraction of c-erbB-2-positive stained cells also was scored from 0 to 3 (0 = negative, 1 = 10% to 20%, 2 = 2 1 % to 50%, 3 = m o r e than 50% positive cells).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue Samples
Breast tissue was obtained from 77 women operated on for primary invasive breast cancer. Specimens were submitted to the Deparmaent of Pathology, Medical School, University of Athens. None of the patients had received prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range, 27 to 86 years), with 23 premenopausa! and 54 postmenopausal women. Surgically resected tissues were immediately fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin and e m b e d d e d in low-melting paraffin. Four-micron-thick sections were cut for histological evaluation. Histological classification was performed according to the World Health Organization guidelines 21 and tumor staging according to the TNM system of the International Union against Cancer. 22 Histological grading of ductal carcinomas was performed according to Elston. :s Nuclear grading was based on nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity. Normal breast tissue included in the surgical specimens was evaluated in 55 cases.

In Situ Hybridization
From the full-length human stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) cDNA, a 217-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment coding for a unique portion of the 3' untranslated region was subcloned into Bluescript KSII+ plasmid (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA). This fragment was provided by Dr W.C. Parks (Washington University Department of Internal Medicine/Dermatology, St Louis, MO). Its specificity to detect human MMP-3 was previously shown by Northern hybridization using cells treated (×72 hours) with phorb01 ester (15 n g / m L ) and interleukin-1 (20 U / m L ) of the human fibroblast cell line CRL-1885 (American Tissue Culture Center, Bethesda, MD).25 Antisense cRNA probe was made by T7 transcription and digoxigenin-UTP labeling (Boehringer Mannheim Dig. Nuclei Acid Detection Kit, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). The sense probe was made using T3 polymerase on a EcoRI linearized fragment. In situ hybridization was p e r f o r m e d as previously described. 26 Briefly, 7-tim-thick rehydrated sections were digested with proteinase K (1 p g / m L ) at 37°C for 30 minutes, treated with 0.25% acetic anhydrite in 0.1 m o l / L triethanolamine for 10 minutes, washed in 2 x SSC, 5 minutes each, and then dehydrated. Overnight hybridization at 42°C was performed using a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe. Sections

ImmunohistochemistrY
Immunostaining for MMP-1, MMP-3 proteins, and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein was performed by the streptavidin-biotinylated (complex) horseradish peroxidase (strept-ABC-HRP) method, as previously described. 24 Briefly, 4-pm-thick, paraffin-embedded sections were cut, dewaxed, and rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation of the slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H202) for 30 minutes. To enhance antigen retrieval for MMP-3, sections were microwaved in 0.01 m o l / L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 750 Watts for 10 minutes, whereas for MMP-1 sections were digested with trypsine for 15 minutes. After rinsing in 0.01 m o l / L phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), normal goat serum was applied for 20 minutes to block nonspecific antibody binding. Subsequently, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies. Purified mouse monoclonal antibodies against MMP-1 (IgG2) and MMP-3 (IgG1) (Oncogence Science, New York, NY) were used at dilutions of 1:75 and 1:25, respectively. The antibody against MMP-1 (Clone 41-IE5) reacts specifically with the protein corresponding to amino acids 332 to 350 of

were stringently washed (2× SSC, 50% formamide, 30 minutes, 50°C) and incubated with RNase A (50 tlg/mL RNase A in TES: 100 mmol/L Tris-HC1, 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, 500 mmol/L NaC1, pH 8.0) for 10 minutes at 37°C. Stringent washings (2× SSC at 50 ° for 15 minutes twice and 0.2× SSC at 50°C for 15 minutes twice) followed. Non-radioisotopic detection of hybridized probe was performed using an alkaline-phosphatase conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000, for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight with nitroblue tetrazolium salt, 175 ng/mL, and 5-bromo-4chloro-3 indolyl phosphate, 340 n g / m L in TSM: 100 mmol/L Tris-HC1, 100 mmol/L NaC1, 50 mmol/L MgCI2, pH 9, 5. Finally, sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red. Semiquantitative evaluation by two independent pathologists based on the extent of staining was performed as described Under immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed using the multiple linear regression t e s t . 27

MMP-1 and MMP-3 immunoreactivity was seen in 59 (77%) and 22 (28.5%) of 77 invasive breast carcinomas, respectively. Immunoreactivity for MMP-1 and MMP-3 was observed in the cytoplasm of cancer cells in 50 of 77 (65%) and 22 of 77 (28.5%) cases, respectively, or in t u m o r stromal cells in 41 of 77 (53%) and 2 of 77 (2.5%) cases, respectively (Figs 1, 2). Simultaneous immunoreactivity for the two proteins was observed in 19 cases. In all positive cases, staining intensity was m o d e r a t e to severe. MMP-1, MMP-3, protein activity, and MMP-3 mRNA expression were detected in the t u m o r c o m p o n e n t , but not in the n o r m a l m a m m a r y epithellium and the in situ c o m p o n e n t of the tumors. T h e relationship between the detection of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-3 mRNA in cancer cells or stromal fibroblasts and several clinicopathologic p a r a m e t e r s (menopausal status, histological type, nuclear grade, stage, E R / P R status) and c-erbB-2 expression is shown in Table 1. O f these parameters, only PR status had a statistically significant inverse correlation with MMP-1 immunoreactivity in cancer or stromal cells (P = .04, P = .04, respectively) (Table 2). In contrast, MMP-1 reactivity in stromal-only fibroblasts showed a statisti-

cally significant correlation with the stage of the disease (P = .04) (Table 3). Moreover, it was more often detected in high-nuclear-grade minors (P = .09) (Table 3). MMP-3 protein reactivity, either in cancer cells or in stromal fibroblasts, did not correlate with any of the parameters studied. MMP-3 m R N A was detected in 72 of 77 invasive breast carcinomas. In situ hybridization clearly localized spindle-shaped connective tissue cells as the main site of MMP-3 mRNA (Figs 3, 4). T h e elongated shapes of these stromal cells and their association with collagen fibers clearly indicate that they are indeed fibroblasts. A small contribution of interstitial m a c r o p h a g e s cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, macrophages represent only a m i n o r fraction of the total stromal cells in breast tumors. 2s Thus, fibroblasts of the peritumoral stroma seem to be largely responsible for the biosynthesis of this enzyme, zs Transcripts for MMP-3 were located in stromal fibroblasts within the t u m o r in 68 cases, and in stromal fibroblasts at the marginal portion of the t u m o r in 69 cases. Co-distribution was observed in 65 cases. MMP-3 m R N A detection within or in the marginal portion of the tumors did not correlate with the clinicopathologic features studied. MMP-3 mRNA was m o r e often detected in the marginal portion of ductal carcinomas (P = .08).

The expression of several m e m b e r s of the MMP gene family appears to be a general characteristic of h u m a n carcinomas. T h e simultaneous expression of several MMP genes is consistent with the concept that extracellular matrix r e m o d e l i n g during t u m o r progression requires the synergistic action of several metalloproteinases p r o d u c e d by cancer cells or by stromal cells. 1 In this study, MMP-1 protein expression in stromal fibroblasts, but not in cancer cells, was significantly correlated with advanced t u m o r stage (P = .04). MMP-3 protein expression a n d MMP-3 mRNA detection did not show such a correlation. Similar findings have b e e n observed for o t h e r MMPs.

closely related to the presence of lymph node metastasis, whereas MMP-2 was not. These findings imply that different MMPs are involved in different stages of breast cancer progression. The association between MMP-1 protein immunoreactivity and tumor stage suggests an important role of MMP-1 for the invasive potential of TABLE 2.

Moreover, previous studies have shown that MMP-3 usually is synthesized coordinately with MMP-1 and that the presence of MMP-3 is essential for full activation of pro-MMP-l.S° Thus, MMP-3 may be associated with tumor invasion predominantly by activaTABLE 3.

In the study of Lochter et al, 31 induction of MMP-3 expression by functionally normal m a m m a r y epithelial cells resulted in a phenotypic conversion characterized by disappearance of E-cadherin and catenins from cell-cell contacts, downregulation of cytokeratins, upregulation of vimentin, induction of keratinocyte growth factor expression, and activation and upregulation of endogenous MMPs. Cells expressing MMP-3 were unable to undergo lactogenic differentiation and became invasive. Once initiated, this phenotypic conversion was essentially stable and progressed even in the absence of continued MMP-3 expression. 3~ These findings suggest that inappropriate expression of MMP-3 may be an early event in the development of m a m m a r y carcinoma. A significant inverse correlation between MMP-1 protein immunoreactivity either in cancer or in stromal cells and PR expression (P = .04 and P = .04, respectively) was also observed. MMP-1 reactivity in stromal cells was more often detected in high-nuclear-grade tumors. PR expression is more often observed in welldifferentiated tumors and is used routinely as a prognostic marker and a predictor of response to endocrine

therapy. Therefore, MMP-1 protein expression may reflect loss of differentiation of breast cancer cells. It is also important to consider possible MMP regulation by steroid h o r m o n e s in mammary tumorigenesis. The precise signaling pathways mediating MMP regulation by h o r m o n e s are not well u n d e r s t o o d but have been shown to involve direct interaction with AP-1 transcription factors, 32 and indirect through growthfactor-induced effects. 3~ Glucocorticoid steroids inhibit transcription of MMP-1 by interfering with AP-1, the major e n h a n c e r factor of the collagenase promoter. ~2 Moreover, in vitro studies in other organs, such as the endometrium, have suggested that progesterone can suppress the expression of MMPs, although estradiol does not appear to directly activate their expression, ss Progesterone enhances the expression of transforming growth factor-[~ mRNA and protein by the endometrial stroma, and this growth factor serves as the principal stromal-derived factor leading to the suppression of MMP expression, s3 In the recent study by Salamonsen et al, 34 progesterone withdrawal from the e n d o m e t r i u m has the potential both to increase the level of p r o MMP-1 within the tissue and to change the balance between the MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases that would be required for active tissue degradation. MMP-1 protein expression did not show any correlation with ER expression. In the study of H a h n e l et al, a5 MMP-11 mRNA expression was more often detected in ER-positive and low-grade than in ER-negative and high-grade breast carcinomas. The authors suggest that with loss of differentiation, a factor secreted by the neoplastic cell that induced MMP-11 expression in the surrounding stroma is no longer produced, and therefore MMP-11 expression is an early event in breast cancer progression. ! n contrast, in our study, the significant correlation between MMP-1 protein expression and the advanced stage of the disease and, furthermore, the significant inverse correlation between MMP-1 expression and PR expression suggest that MMP-1 expression probably constitutes a late event in breast cancer progression. MMP-3 mRNA was more often detected in ductal than in lobular carcinomas. Chenard et a119 and Engel et aP 6 reported that MMP-11 protein and MMP=ll mRNA were significantly higher in ductal than lobular cancers. This association may be related to the different biological behavior of ductal-type carcinomas. The cellular localization of MMPs in different tumors is not well known. In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, MMP-1 was f o u n d exclusively in cancer c e l l s y whereas in colorectal carcinomas, MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNAs were detected only in stromal cellsY In esophageal carcinomas, MMP-1 and MMP-3 immunoreactivity was observed primarily in small cancer nests of the deeply invasive or in the marginal portion of the tumors. 15 In our study, immunoreactivity for MMP-i and MMP-3 protein was observed in the cytoplasm of cancer cells (in 65% and 28.5% of tumors, respectively) and in t u m o r stromal fibroblasts (in 53% and 2.5%, respec-

tively) with a heterogeneous staining pattern. Transcripts for MMP-3 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization only in stromal fibroblasts within the t u m o r or in the marginal portion of the tumor. Clavel et aP 9 observed MMP-1 and MMP-3 protein reactivity only in a few cases of breast cancers, and Polette et a128 detected mRNA for MMP-3 in a small n u m b e r of 17 breast carcinomas. The difference observed in comparison with our results may be due to the use of polyclonal antibodies in the first study and to the larger n u m b e r of cases we investigated. Our findings of MMP-3 mRNA expression exclusively within stromal fibroblasts and of MMP-3 protein immunoreactivity exclusively within breast adenocarcin o m a cells indicates that MMP-3 is synthesized by stromal fibroblasts. The synthesized protein is secreted and most likely absorbed by the neighboring cancer cells. Such a mechanism was demonstrated previously by E m o n a r d et al. 4° Alternatively, breast adenocarcin o m a cells may produce MMP-3, but the mRNA levels are below the sensitivity of the in situ hybridization technique. Absence of MMP-3 reactivity in fibroblasts may be due to rapid release of the enzyme. Such descrepancies between MMP mRNA transcription and MMP protein detection through immunohistochemistry were previously reported by others. 4143These descrepancies are not necessarily contradictory. To the contrary, they reflect the complex interactions occuring during cancer invasion. MMP production, storage, and release of a given MMP are triggered by a series of local factors, as amply demonstrated by in vitro studies. In conclusion, MMP-1 immunoreactivity in stromal fibroblasts is associated with the advanced stages of breast carcinomas, whereas MMP-1 reactivity either in stromal fibroblasts or in cancer cells shows a statistically significant inverse correlation with PR expression.
