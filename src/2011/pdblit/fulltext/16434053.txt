Many Gram-negative bacteria use a type III secretion (T3S) system to directly inject effector molecules into eucaryotic cells in order to establish a symbiotic or pathogenic relationship with their host. The translocation of many T3S proteins requires specialized chaperones from the bacterial cytosol. SycD belongs to a class of T3S chaperones that assists the secretion of pore-forming translocators and, specifically chaperones the translocators YopB and YopD from enteropathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica. In addition, SycD is involved in the regulation of virulence factor biosynthesis and secretion. In this study, we present two crystal structures of Y. enterocolitica SycD at 1.95 and 2.6 Å resolution, the first experimental structures of a T3S class II chaperone specific for translocators. The fold of SycD is entirely -helical and reveals three tetratricopeptide repeat-like motifs that had been predicted from amino acid sequence. In both structures, SycD forms dimers utilizing residues from the first tetratricopeptide repeat motif. Using sitedirected mutagenesis and size exclusion chromatography, we verified that SycD forms head-to-head homodimers in solution. Although in both structures, dimerization largely depends on the same residues, the two assemblies represent alternative dimers that exhibit different monomer orientations and overall shape. In these two distinct head-to-head dimers, both the concave and the convex surface of each monomer are accessible for interactions with the SycD binding partners YopB and YopD. A SycD variant carrying two point mutations in the dimerization interface is properly folded but defective in dimerization. Expression of this stable SycD monomer in Yersinia does not rescue the phenotype of a sycD null mutant, suggesting a physiological relevance of the dimerization interface.

from signal transduction to programmed cell death and cytoskeletal dynamics ensuring bacterial survival and spreading (see Mota and Cornelis1 and Navarro et al.2 for recent reviews). The secretion apparatus resembles a molecular syringe, therefore called needle complex, and spans the bacterial inner membrane, the peptidoglycan layer and the outer membrane and ends in a needle-shaped structure (for a review, see Galán and Wolf-Watz3). Effector molecules are believed to reach the host cell by traveling through this channel. Successful translocation requires a special family of proteins, the translocators, which are also transported by the needle complex and form a pore in the eucaryotic cell membrane, allowing the effectors to enter the host cell (reviewed by Büttner and Bonas4).

998 Productive secretion of many proteins by the T3S system depends on a number of specialized chaperones. Some of the secreted proteins form specific complexes with their cognate chaperones in the bacterial cytosol but are released from the chaperone directly before secretion. According to the function of their substrates, T3S chaperones are divided into three groups.5 Members of class I bind to effector proteins, whereas class II is dedicated to translocator proteins. A third class assists distal components of the needle complex that are themselves exported by the nascent machine. The functions of T3S chaperones are still under debate, possibly because there are different functions according to the classes and some chaperones may fulfil more than one function. Moreover, different proposed roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive (for reviews, see Parsot et al.,5 Feldman and Cornelis6 and Wilharm et al.7). It has been proposed that they ensure effector stabilization and prevent unproductive interactions, as well as aggregation of membrane localization domains within the effector.8 Furthermore, the chaperones are suggested to maintain their binding partners in a secretion-competent, partially unfolded state9 and to act as pilots towards the needle complex.10 The effector­chaperone complex may also present a three-dimensional secretion signal and uphold a secretion hierarchy among the secretion substrates.11 It is worth noting that several class II chaperones are also involved in the regulation of T3S-associated gene expression.12­14 Class I and II chaperones share a small size, but unlike the effector chaperones, the representatives of class II do not exclusively possess an acidic pI. Numerous class I chaperones are structurally characterized (for a structural review on T3S, see Johnson et al.)15 and reveal a common mixed / fold despite low sequence identity. Few structures of class III members have so far been solved such as the heterodimeric PscG/PscE, binding the Pseudomonas needle component,16 and Escherichia coli needle extension chaperone CesA.17 However, their structural heterogeneity may justify the division into additional classes. No structure is available for class II chaperones, although tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like motifs have been recently identified in their sequences.18 The three pathogenic Yersinia species (Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of the plague, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica are gastrointestinal pathogens) depend on their Ysc­Yop T3S system during infection. The translocated virulence factors termed Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) possess specific Yop chaperones (Sycs). SycD (LcrH in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis) is the corresponding yersinial representative of class II chaperones. SycD specifically chaperones the translocator proteins YopB and YopD.19, 20 Furthermore, SycD is involved in the modulation of the T3S system via both Yop secretion control as well as negative regulation of yop gene expression.21­23 Here, we present the crystal structure of the multifunctional chaperone SycD from Y. enterocoli-

tica. We furthermore identified the homodimerization interface in SycD via site-directed mutagenesis. These results provide the structural basis to rationalize previously obtained information from mutagenesis studies of SycD and its homologues.

Results
Purification, crystallization and biophysical analysis of SycD Recombinantly produced Y. enterocolitica fulllength SycD (19.4 kDa, 168 residues) failed to crystallize in spite of extensive screening, most likely due to its tendency to form higher oligomers (data not shown), a phenomenon also observed by other groups.24,25 During prolonged storage at 4 °C, SycD gradually degraded into a shorter, N-terminally truncated but stable fragment (amino acids 21­168) as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis (data not shown). The same stable fragment (SycD21­168) was obtained by limited proteolysis with trypsin (Fig. 1). Further supported by multiple sequence alignments of SycD with homologous T3S class II chaperones, secondary structure predictions and an existing structural model for the TPR domain of LcrH/SycD18 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1OOL], we thus generated a shorter expression construct encompassing SycD residues 21­163. In addition to the first 20 amino acids, this construct lacks five C-terminal residues eliminating Cys164 that may cause disulfide-mediated oligomerization during crystallization. SycD21­163 yielded large tetragonal crystals (space group P4122 or P4322) diffracting to 3.8 Å at best. These crystals have a huge unit cell, and Matthews coefficient probability analysis26 suggested that the asymmetric unit most likely harbors 34 molecules. Since structure determination has failed for this crystal form, we applied reductive methylation of lysine residues in order to improve crystal quality or obtain a second crystal form. This method has already been applied successfully to several other

999 for T3S class II chaperones.18 The repeat domain in SycD21­163 spans residues 36 to 137 and is composed of six -helices with the helices arranged in an antiparallel manner. The six helices 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B are organized in TPR1-3, followed by the C-terminal helix (h8) that is joined also in an antiparallel orientation resulting in 3.5 repeats overall. In a single TPR motif of SycD, helices A and B pack against each other with dihedral packing angles  ranging from - 152° to - 164°, whereas packing between helices B and A from adjoining TPR motifs shows slightly lower angles (- 149° to - 158°) as calculated by PROMOTIF.30 The twist per repeat in the overall right-handed superhelical TPR domain of SycD is 43°­49° between TPR1 and TPR2, 46°­47° between TPR2 and TPR3 and 91°­95° for the whole domain TPR1­TPR3 (rotation angles chi as obtained by superposition in LSQKAB31). These values are comparable with data from the literature.32 The twisted arrangement of the TPR motifs results in a concave and convex face of SycD (Fig 3a). The integrity of the TPR fold is maintained by a pattern of small and large residues consistent with the canonical TPR sequence motif (Trp4-Leu7-Gly8Tyr11-Ala20-Phe24-Ala27-Pro32). 33 The long Cterminal -helix h8 following the TPR motifs is also termed capping, stabilization or solvating helix and is found in almost all currently known structures of TPR-containing proteins such as protein phospha-

T3S components.27,28 Lysine dimethylation resulted in a different crystal form (space group C2) of SycD21­163 that diffracted to a resolution of 1.95 Å (Table 1). Complete modification of all 22 methylation sites in SycD21­163meth was checked by MALDITOF (Fig. 2a). In the new crystal form, four methylated lysine residues are actually involved in crystal contacts (Fig. 2b). The structure of SycD21­163meth was finally solved by molecular replacement using the monoclinic crystal form and a mixed model of a synthetic TPR protein as search model (see Methods section). Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. SycD structure reveals tetratricopeptide repeats SycD behaves as a dimer in solution (see below and Ref. 25) and the monoclinic crystal form contains two molecules of SycD21­163 per asymmetric unit. The electron density is well defined for residues 21­154 in monomer A and for residues 21­160 in monomer B. Both monomers differ only in the position of 10 N-terminal residues, indicating this region to be flexible. The rest of the molecule superposes well with an r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å for 125 common C atoms. The SycD monomer consists of eight -helices (h0, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, h8) (Fig. 3a). The structure reveals the TPR-like motifs that had been predicted

the repeats TPR1-3 (103 equivalent C atoms; not shown). However, superposition of all common residues between SycD and the model (32­160, 129 C atoms) increases the r.m.s.d. to 3.6 Å due to a completely different orientation of the C-terminal helix h8. Additional striking differences between the model and the crystal structure were observed for the side chains of Tyr93, Phe106 and Arg71 (Fig. 3b). In the model, the side chains of Tyr93 and Phe106 point outwards to the convex surface, whereas in the crystal structure, both side chains are flipped by 180° and deeply buried in the interstice between TPR2 and TPR3, stabilizing the TPR fold by hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, in the structure, the hydroxyl group of Tyr93 points into the concave groove (Figs. 3b and 9c), where it may serve as hydrogen bond donor/acceptor in translocator binding. The dual function of Tyr93 might explain the unexpected null mutant phenotype observed for LcrH Y93A.42 Interestingly, in the crystal structure, the side chain of Arg71 in helix A of TPR2 does not freely project into the concave groove; rather it is bent towards Glu37 from TPR1 forming an intramolecular salt bridge that neutralizes its positive charge (see below). To summarize, the crystal structure of SycD is similar to the LcrH homology model but discloses several differences that might help to explain observations of previous mutagenesis studies.

Taken together, the -helical fold of class II chaperone SycD reveals genuine TPR repeats. Comparison with the LcrH/SycD homology model discloses distinct differences The crystal structure of SycD21­163 monomers A and B superposes with the LcrH/SycD32­165 homology model proposed by Pallen et al.18 (PDB accession code 1OOL) showing an r.m.s.d. of 1.0 Å for

The apparent molecular mass for SycD21­163 determined experimentally by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering gives significantly larger values (Mr  39­42 kDa) than expected for the monomeric chaperone ( 17 kDa) (compare Fig. 7a), suggesting that the SycD dimer in the asymmetric unit is also present in solution. However, in the monoclinic crystal packing, different quaternary assemblies of the two SycD monomers are possible, resulting in two distinct dimers (Fig. 4a and b). In the elongated dimer 1, both monomers interact head to head via TPR1. The second assembly (dimer 2) shows the two monomers dimerizing asymmetrically back to back via the convex face of the TPR repeats involving TPR2 and the turns between the repeats (Fig. 5). The dimerization interfaces in dimer 1 and dimer 2 are both centered at the corresponding local rotation axis and mediated by hydrophobic interactions supported by hydrogen bonds. Dimethylated lysine Mly57 at the edge of the dimerization interface of dimer 1 supports the dimerization only via its aliphatic side chain, whereas the dimethylamino head group is not involved. Interface analyses using the PISA37 and the protein­protein interaction server38 (summarized in Table 2) suggested that both assemblies could result in a stable dimer. Although the structural and statistical analysis favored dimer 1, we were not able to eliminate with certainty the alternative dimer 2. So which one is the correct SycD dimer?

SycD forms a head-to-head dimer To verify which dimer assembly SycD adopts in solution, we mutated residues involved in the observed interfaces in order to disrupt the interaction, followed by an analysis of the mutants in solution. Based on a multiple sequence alignment of SycD and homologous TPR-containing T3S chaperones (Fig. 6), we excluded highly conserved or canonical residues from mutagenesis. Concerning elongated dimer 1, we selected Ala61 and Leu65 for the mutation into large, charged glutamates (single substitutions A61E, L65E and double mutant A61E/ L65E). Both residues are centrally buried in the interface and occur twice due to the 2-fold symmetry, thereby facing each other (Fig. 5a). The introduction of two or four negatively charged residues was expected to cause steric hindrance as well as electrostatic repulsion and, therefore, the disruption of the dimer interface. In the interface of compact

dimer 2, we selected Ser94 as well as Tyr95, a key residue located at the convex surface mediating hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonded interactions between both monomers (Fig. 5b). Substitution of large Tyr95 for small, polar serine instead of alanine was chosen to prevent aggregation. Equivalently to the glutamate double mutant A61E/L65E for the interface in dimer 1, we generated the double mutant S94E/Y95E for interface 2. All five SycD21­163 mutant proteins, single-site mutants A61E, L65E and Y95S as well as the double mutants A61E/L65E and S94E/Y95E, were highly soluble and could be purified in wild-type-like quantities using the same protocol as for SycD21­163. To investigate the oligomerization state of wildtype and mutant SycD21­163, we performed analytical size exclusion chromatography. Wild-type SycD21­163 as well as both dimer interface 2 mutants Y95S and S94E/Y95E elute with an apparent molecular mass of 40­43 kDa, whereas the single

SycD21­163,  40 kDa for the mutant Y95S and  41 kDa for S95EY95E, but only  21 kDa for mutants A61E, L65E and A61E/L65E. This is in line with the results derived from chromatography. To ensure that the effect was not caused by destroying the integrity of the TPR fold, we further analyzed the wild type and the mutants by native PAGE and circular dichroism (wild-type and A61E/L65E, data not shown). In the native gel, SycD21­163 wild-type and the interface mutants migrate as focused single bands consistent with folded proteins. Wild-type SycD21­163 and the mutant Y95S (pI 5.3) migrate on the same level, whereas the single glutamate mutants A65E, L65E (pI 5.2) and more significantly, the double mutants A61E/L65E and S94E/Y95E (pIcalc 5.1) migrate faster due to the additional surfaceexposed negative charges accelerating migration in the electric field. The CD spectra of the wild-type and the mutant proteins are virtually identical, displaying two minima at 208 and 222 nm that are characteristic for -helical secondary structure elements. From these results, we concluded that the mutants were correctly folded. Dimeric mutant SycD21­163 S94E/Y95E readily crystallized after reductive methylation, although in a condition different from that of wild-type SycD21­163meth, and crystals belonged to space group P3221. The crystal structure of SycD21­163 S94E/Y95E revealed a head-to-head homodimer as well, with the dimer axis being the crystallographic 2-fold axis. The interfacing residues are basically the same, forming a predominately hydrophobic surface (Table 2), although the two monomers are rotated more heavily with respect to each other showing a crossing angle of 90° instead of 61° as for dimer 1. This results again in an elongated although additionally kinked dimer conformation (dimer 3) that is stabilized exclusively by nonpolar contacts, lacking hydrogen bonds or salt bridges between the monomers (Fig. 7b). Our results from the mutational analysis and the additional mutant structure strongly suggest that the SycD dimer in solution corresponds to a head-to-head dimer and that dimerization is disrupted in the A61E, L65E and A61E/L65E mutants.

To investigate the physiological role of SycD dimerization, we carried out in vivo experiments in Yersinia comparing a wild-type strain, a sycD null mutant and the sycD null mutant reexpressing either wild-type sycD or the sycD double mutant A61E/ L65E. Culture supernatants were analyzed by SDSPAGE to assay for Yop secretion. Total cell fractions and supernatants were analyzed by Western blot for production and secretion of YopE and of the SycD binding partners YopB and YopD. Experiments were carried out in the absence and presence of calcium ions in order to monitor the calcium dependence of Yop production. The SycD A61E/L65E mutant showed characteristics typical of a sycD null mutant (Fig. 8). These include the lack of YopB and YopD secretion in the absence of calcium, increased YopE

production in the presence of calcium and an increased LcrV secretion independent of the calcium concentration. Mutations in the SycD dimerization interface obviously abrogate the functionality of SycD. Implications for further interaction surfaces To identify potential interfaces in SycD involved in protein­protein interactions, we examined the electrostatic surface potential, conserved sequence features, predicted binding sites as well as previously identified residues of SycD that are mandatory for chaperone function.22,40,41 The electrostatic surface potential of the elongated dimer of SycD21­163 is

shown in Fig. 9a. The flat top/bottom face of the dimer displays an extended negative charge that additionally encompasses the upper part of the concave groove, whereas the lower part of the concave face on the dimer front exposes a predominantly hydrophobic area interspersed with positively charged patches. The side chain of Arg71 in the crystal structure is bent toward Glu37, forming a salt bridge (compare Fig. 3b), and does not create a positively charged patch on the concave face together with Arg105 contrary to the predictions derived from the homology model.18 In addition to the region within the concave face that has been previously identified as binding groove,42 the prediction program ProMate43 suggested a large continuous patch for protein­protein interactions additionally comprising residues from the top of the monomer, reaching further to the upper part of the opposite, convex face (data not shown). In order to visualize the conservation of surface residues in SycD and other T3S class II chaperones and thus putative conserved interaction sites, the structure-based multiple alignment of Fig. 6 was converted into a property file via ProtSkin. The concave surface of SycD exhibits numerous conserved amino acids, whereas the convex side of the chaperone shows little sequence conservation (Fig. 9b). Most of the protein's tyrosine residues on the concave face are conserved throughout the majority of the T3S class II chaperones. Additionally, conserved, surface-exposed residues comprise an acidic and a heterocyclic/aromatic side chain (Glu37,

All of these residues line the concave groove of the chaperone with exception of Leu39 in the dimer interface, Leu76 pointing toward the convex outside and the protruding Tyr68. Extensive random and subsequent site-directed mutational analyses complemented by investigations of mutant stability had been carried out for the binding groove, the canonical sequence motif and additional surface-exposed residues in SycD,22,40,41,44 covering also most of the conserved residues mentioned above (summarized in Table 3). These studies had identified surface-located residues that are indispensable in binding to the translocators. Residues whose alanine mutants are defective in YopB but not in YopD binding (Phe59, Arg71, Phe72, Leu74,

Gly75, His109)40 point into the concave groove and are primarily located in TPR2 helix A (surface-located residues Arg71 and His109 depicted in Fig. 9c). Of these, Arg71 contributes to the TPR stability via a salt bridge to conserved Glu37 (Figs. 3b and 9b and c). Conserved His109 opposite in the concave groove is probably involved in YopB binding as well, since mutation to alanine weakens the interaction41 (Fig. 9b and c). Thus, the concave face of SycD is most likely involved in YopB binding. YopD binding and secretion strictly depend on His67 (Refs. 40,41) located in the turn separating TPR1 from TPR2 and Leu76, both accessible only from the convex TPR face, as well as Leu42 at the edge of the dimerization interface.

Alanine substitutions of conserved Tyr40 and Tyr47, exposed on the concave face, resulted in a less stable chaperone, abrogated binding and secretion of YopB and YopD and impaired the regulatory function on Yop synthesis and secretion,41 indicating that these amino acids are also necessary for maintaining the TPR integrity (Fig. 9c, green). As already mentioned, conserved, buried Tyr93 with its hydroxyl group pointing into the concave groove most likely stabilizes the TPR fold, simultaneously enabling hydrogen bonds potentially required in

translocator binding (Figs. 3b and 9c). Residues Phe72, Phe73, Leu74, Cys79, Phe108 and Ile134 are buried and their mutation will most likely affect the TPR fold. Overall, surface-exposed residues affecting YopB binding map to the concave face of the structure, whereas those required for YopD binding are located on the convex surface (Fig. 9c, red and blue). This strongly supports the idea that YopB

binds to the concave face and YopD to the convex face of SycD.

structure of a T3S class II chaperone specific for T3S translocators. It confirms the prediction that T3S class II chaperones contain TPR-like repeats and, moreover, shows that a structural model of the SycD monomer based on the structure of serine/threonine PP518 is in good overall agreement with the crystal structure of the SycD monomer. Under physiological conditions, however, SycD forms dimers in solution (Ref. 25; this work). Proteins containing TPR repeats dimerize mainly via the convex outer side formed by TPR motifs in the middle of the repeat domain as observed in the crystal structures of human O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase45 (1W3B), P. aeruginosa type 4 pilus protein PilF46 (2FI7) or the mitochondrial outer membrane transporter Tom70p 47 (2GW1). The monomers in these dimers are tilted (in the PilF dimer by approximately 20°). A minimal region for dimerization of the TPR domain of Hsp90 cochaperone Sti1 has been recently identified to be located in helix A of the second TPR motif.48 For SycD, two different assemblies of the monomers into a dimer seemed possible, based on the packing in the monoclinic crystals. The compact dimer 2 shows a back-to-back dimerization via the convex outer side, as described for other TPR-containing proteins above, exhibiting an asymmetric interface-- very unusual but not unprecedented for homodimers.49,50 The back-to-back dimer 2 could finally be excluded by mutagenesis studies. In contrast, SycD dimerization involves mainly helices A and B of the first TPR motif generating a head-to-head assembly of a rather elongated shape with the monomers tilted by a larger angle (dimer 1  61°). However, the observed tailing of the size exclusion chromatography profile for SycD indicates a dimer­monomer equilibrium51 and the stability of monomeric SycD21­163 mutants strongly suggests that SycD dimerization is nonobligate. This is in line with the finding that SycD can form two structurally different head-to-head homodimers with distinct arrangements of the monomers utilizing the same

interface. This is extremely unusual and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a homodimer exhibiting two alternative dimer assemblies sharing the same interface. SycD dimerization is almost exclusively mediated by hydrophobic contacts. There is only one hydrogen bond in the interface of dimer 1 linking the side chain of Gln60 with the backbone oxygen of Glu30. No polar interaction at all is found in dimer 3. While the hydrophobic contacts confer considerable affinity to the SycD dimer in vitro, the specificity may be limited, as also suggested by the two different dimer arrangements. The apparent lack of specificity implies that in vivo this interface could be involved in interactions other than homodimerization, e.g., localization to the membrane or the T3S apparatus, potentially via binding to so far unknown interaction partners. Known SycD binding partners include further regulatory T3S components such as TyeA and YscE.52 SycD could possibly bind YscE via TPR motif 1 in a manner similar to that observed for the Pseudomonas YscE homologue PscE in complex with the TPR-like protein PscG.16 So far, only few SycD mutations had been described that can be assigned to the dimerization interface and show an effect on translocator binding (Leu39, Leu42).40,41 However, the in vivo phenotype of the monomeric SycD mutant A61E/L65E clearly indicates that this dimerization interface is functionally relevant. This SycD mutant is stable and folded under physiological conditions in vitro and both the concave and convex binding faces are intact. The null mutant-like behavior, however, suggests that either dimerization is indispensable for appropriate SycD function or that the mutation eliminated so far undetected interactions of the chaperone with the translocators or other interaction partners. In contrast to T3S class I chaperones, where distinct features such as hydrophobic surface patches and a so-called  motif28 have been identified that are essential for the interaction with the specific secretion target, class II chaperones interact with

1008 multiple binding partners of different fold and function and consequentially had to develop a panoply of binding sites. TPR-containing proteins predominantly interact with their binding partners via both the concave groove (the prevalent binding site) and the convex outer side, but basically use all possible faces of the TPR domain for ligand and interdomain contacts (for a review, see D'Andrea and Regan53). So far, only limited information on binding sites in class II chaperones is available, and the prediction of further interaction sites in these multivalent T3S regulators is therefore challenging. SycD is also involved in control of effector biosynthesis by establishing a negative regulatory network on yop gene expression together with YopD and LcrQ (YscM1 and YscM 2 in Y. enterocolitica).14,22 Additionally, SycD was reported to have a regulatory effect on Yop secretion via an YscY­YscX loop.54 Regions in SycD required for YscY binding and regulatory effect were mapped to TPR1 and a socalled NEISS region located N-terminally of TPR1 with Glu30 as the key regulatory residue.22,55 In the crystal structure of SycD, the NEISS element is freely accessible due to its linear, exposed structure. Thus, experimental results on its regulatory role appear plausible (Fig. 3, NEISS colored in magenta). Tyrosine, an amino acid with a polar hydroxyl group, displays a high propensity to occur in protein­ protein interfaces, acting as binding energy hotspot,56 and to protrude from the surface to offer suitable interaction sites. 57 Protruding tyrosines were identified to be the functional residues in a TPR domain for binding a proline-rich ligand.58 YopB possesses five proline residues within a short N-terminal fragment (residues 24­55). However, systematic sequence deletions in YopB did not unravel a clearly defined chaperone-binding domain. Rather several parts of the YopB sequence seem to be required for SycD binding.20 The crystal structure of SycD and the identification of a new interaction surface in the translocator chaperone contribute to the understanding of its versatile functionality. Although both the convex as well as the concave side of the TPR in the SycD headto-head dimer are freely accessible, stoichiometry and affinity of the SycD/YopD/YopB interactions remain to be determined. Certainly, a crystal structure of SycD in complex with one of its cognate binding partners YopB or YopD would answer many remaining questions. However, since the translocators are hydrophobic transmembrane proteins and can apparently bind to the chaperone in a molten globule conformation,59 such a complex structure represents a major challenge or might not be feasible at all.

T3S Translocator Chaperone SycD Structure expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) digested with restriction endonucleases BamHI and EcoRI. A second construct was generated by cloning codons 21­ 163 of sycD into the same vector. Both constructs were checked by sequencing. Protein expression and purification E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL (Stratagene) was used to produce full-length SycD and SycD21­163 as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.9. Recombinant gene expression was induced with 0.25 mM isopropyl--Dthiogalactoside at 20 °C for 14 h. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer [phosphate-buffered saline/ 10 mM -mercaptoethanol/5 L Benzonase (MERCK)/ protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), pH 7.4] and lysed using a homogenizer (Constant Cell Disruption Systems). Cleared lysates were applied to glutathionecoupled Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare), washed with lysis buffer and finally with protease cleavage buffer [50 mM Tris/150 mM NaCl/10 mM -mercaptoethanol/ 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 7.4]. The glutathione S-transferase tag was cleaved on column at 4 °C over 48­60 h by adding 500 U PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). The PreScission cleavage site inserts five additional residues (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser, assigned as - 5 to -1) at the N-terminus. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mM DTT. SycD and SycD21­163 were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ, GE Healthcare) using a NaCl gradient in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0. Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT as running buffer was used as the final purification step. Purified protein was analyzed by native as well as SDS-PAGE, subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis to verify the protein size and concentrated to 14 mg/mL (SycD21­163meth) and 23 mg/mL (SycD21­163) for crystallization trials. Limited proteolysis and reductive methylation Purified full-length SycD (0.8 mg/mL) was digested at 20 °C with 1:100 trypsin (sequencing grade, modified, Promega) and aliquots were taken during the reaction course. Digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membrane and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. SycD21­163 purified by anion exchange chromatography was subjected to ultrafiltration using Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius, MWCO 5000) for buffer exchange with 50 mM sodium potassium phosphate/150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The protein was concentrated to  10 mg/mL in a total volume of 2 times 1 mL and methylated as described.60 Briefly, 1 mL protein solution was gently mixed with 20 L of 1 M dimethylamine­borane complex (ABC) immediately followed by the addition of 40 L of 1 M formaldehyde and incubated on ice in the dark for 2 h. The reaction step was repeated twice with only half of the volumes added in the third round followed by incubation for 36 h. Quenching of the reaction was achieved by addition of 100 L of 1 M ammonium sulfate and incubation for 24 h. The methylated protein was mixed with 50 mM DTT to a final concentration of 5 mM and separated from the reaction residue by size exclusion chromatography as described above.

Dynamic light scattering was performed in a DynaPro 801TC system (ProteinSolutions, sample concentrations 0.8­5.4 mg/mL). Crystallization, data collection and processing Initial screening for SycD21­163 in 96-well format using diverse commercially available crystallization matrices and nanoliter pipetting yielded tiny needles. Optimized tetragonal SycD21­163 crystals grew within 2 weeks at 4 °C using hanging-drop vapor diffusion by adding 0.4 L of crystallization cocktail (1.9­2.2 potassium acetate/0.1 M Tris, pH 8.2) to 2 L protein solution. Extensive initial screening for reductively methylated SycD21­163meth produced crystalline plates in a single condition at 4 °C. Optimized monoclinic crystals of SycD21­163meth grew in 10­20% 2-propanol, 20­23% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and 0.1 M sodium acetate using sitting-drop vapor diffusion and a protein/reservoir ratio of 2:1. Initial, welldiffracting crystals of reductively methylated SycD21­163 S94E/Y95E formed within 3 days at 4 °C from a crystallization cocktail containing 40% PEG 400, 5% PEG 3350 and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Data of SycD21­163 and SycD21­163meth were collected at 100 K using 20­26% glycerol in the crystallization mix as cryoprotectant at beamlines DESY/EMBL X12 (Hamburg, Germany) and ESRF ID23-1 (Grenoble, France). Data of SycD21­163 S94E/Y95E meth crystals flash-frozen without additional cryoprotectant were collected at beamline ESRF ID14-1. Data of SycD21­163 were processed with HKL2000 (DENZO/SCALEPACK).61 Data of SycD21­163meth and SycD21­163 S94E/Y95Emeth were processed with XDS and scaled with XSCALE.62 Data collection statistics are given in Table 1. Structure determination and analysis The structure for the monoclinic data set of SycDmeth was solved by molecular replacement (MR) in 21­163 the program PHASER.63 Correct localization of both monomers in the asymmetric unit was only achieved by searching with a mixed model of the TPR domain of a synthetic protein (PDB accession code 2FO7), obtained by application of the Fold and Function Assignment System algorithm to the SycD sequence.64 The correct MR solution became evident only after the second monomer was placed in PHASER. The initial 68% complete model was refined using the rigid-body and simulated annealing tools of the program suite PHENIX.65 The final model was obtained by several cycles of manual building with the program COOT66 and restrained refinement with REFMAC567 or PHENIX. The refined model was later used for MR of SycD21­163 S94E/Y95Emeth. Electron density was visible for SycD21­163meth residues 21­154 in the first monomer, and residues 21­160 in the second. For SycD21­163 S94E/ Y95Emeth, electron density was visible for residues 29­ 160 only.

Induction of the yop regulon was described by Cornelis et al.74 The bacteria were cultivated in permissive (brain­heart infusion supplemented with 20 mM sodium oxalate in the absence of Ca2+) or nonpermissive conditions (brain­heart infusion supplemented with 5 mM calcium chloride in the presence of Ca2+).74,75 Expression of the different genes cloned downstream from the pBAD promoter was routinely induced by adding 0.2% L-arabinose to the culture just before the shift to 37 °C, and again 2 h later. The carbon source was glycerol (4 mg/ml). Total cell and supernatant fractions were separated by centrifugation at 20,800g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was taken as total cell fraction. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid 10% (w/v) final for 1 h at 4 °C. Secreted proteins were analyzed on Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-PAGE. In each case, proteins secreted by 3 × 108 bacteria were loaded per lane. For detection of proteins by immunoblotting, 1.6 × 108 bacteria (total cell fraction) and supernatants from 2.5 × 107 bacteria (supernatant fraction) were loaded per lane. Immunoblotting was carried out using polyclonal rat antibodies directed against YopB (MIPA98; 1:300), YopD (MIPA96; 1:300) and YopE (MIPA94; 1:10,000) or polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against SycD (MIPA35; 1:1000). Detection was performed with the respective secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Dako) before development with supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).
