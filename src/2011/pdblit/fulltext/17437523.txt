The M-superfamily of conotoxins has a typical Cys framework (-CC-C-CCC-), and is one of the eight major superfamilies found in the venom of the cone snail. Depending on the number of residues located in the last Cys loop (between Cys4 and Cys5), the M-superfamily family can be divided into four branches, namely M-1, -2, -3 and -4. Recently, two M-1 branch conotoxins (mr3e and tx3a) have been reported to possess a new disulfide bond arrangement between Cys1 and Cys5, Cys2 and Cys4, and Cys3 and Cys6, which is different from those seen in the M-2 and M-4 branches. Here we report the 3D structure of mr3e determined by 2D 1 H NMR in aqueous solution. Twenty converged structures of this peptide were obtained on the basis of 190 distance constraints obtained from NOE connectivities, as well as six u dihedral angle, three hydrogen bond, and three disulfide bond constraints. The rmsd values about the averaged ° coordinates of the backbone atoms were 0.43 ± 0.19 A. Although mr3e has the same Cys arrangement as M-2 and M-4 conotoxins, it adopts a distinctive backbone conformation with the overall molecule resembling a `flying bird'. Thus, different disulfide linkages may be employed by conotoxins with the same Cys framework to result in a more diversified backbone scaffold.

Over their 50 million years of evolution, cone snails have developed a series of small disulfide-rich peptides (conotoxins) in their venoms. Each peptide can selectively target a specific isoform of ion channel or membrane receptor [1,2]. Although it is estimated that each species of cone snail possesses 50­200 conotoxins in its arsenal, and there are more than 50 000 known conotoxins, the majority belong to several gene superfamilies and only several structural motifs are widely shared. M-superfamily conotoxins form a group with a typical cysteine arrangement of (-CC-C-C-CC-) and par2596

ticularly highly conserved signal peptide sequences. Depending on the number of residues located in the last cysteine loop, the M-superfamily has been provisionally divided into four branches, M-1, M-2, M-3 and M-4 [3]. The M-superfamily conotoxins l-, w- and jM-conotoxins (22­24 amino acids) have all been identified from fish-hunting cone snails and belong to M-4 branch [4­6]. Although they have diverse molecular targets (Na+channel, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and K+channel, respectively), they share a disulfide connectivity (C1­C4, C2­C5, C3­C6) and common backbone scaffold [7]. In contrast to the M-4 branch,

the other three branches of the M-superfamily are relatively small (12­19 amino acids) and are found mostly in mollusk- and worm-hunting cone snails. Disulfide linkage analyses of two M-2 branch conotoxins, mr3a and tx3c, have shown that they possess a distinctive disulfide bond arrangement of C1­C6, C2­C4 and C3­C5 [3]. In addition, BtIIIB, another M-2 branch conotoxin from the venom of a vermivorous cone snail Conus betulinus, has been proven to have the same disulfide linkage as mr3a and tx3c [8]. Recently, a third disulfide bond arrangement within M-superfamily conotoxins has been characterized. Two M-1 branch conotoxins, mr3e (Fig. 1) and tx3a were found to have a new disulfide linkage (C1­C5, C2­C4, C3­C6), which differs from those seen in M-2 and M-4 branch conotoxins [9]. Here we report the 3D structure of mr3e, a novel M-1 branch conotoxin with the above new disulfide connectivity.

Gly7. The valine residue at position 1 was finally assigned on the basis of NOEs from the a- and b-protons of Val1 to the amide proton of Cys2. The amide proton of Val1 disappeared in the H2O spectrum, possibly because of its special position at the N-terminus and fast exchange in water. NOESY data acquired at 294 K for conotoxin mr3e showed a large number of NOEs which suggested that the structure of the peptide was sufficiently constrained for distancegeometry calculations. Figure 2 shows the sequential daN(i,i+1) connectivities on the CaH-NH fingerprint region of the NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 200 ms. All chemical shifts are listed in Table 1. Structure calculation and evaluation NMR experiments provided enough distance and angle constraints to calculate the structure of mr3e. The constraints for structure elucidation were determined from a survey of NMR data using the traditional visual analysis method developed by Wuthrich [10]. In total, 169 distance constraints were obtained from the 200-ms NOESY spectrum. Six u angle constraints and three disulfide bonds from Cys2 to Cys14, Cys3 to Cys12, and Cys8 to Cys15 were added to the distance constraints for primary structure determination. A set of 20 structures was generated with a mean global ° rmsd of 1.88 A using the dyana (v. 1.5) [11] software package. The lowest energy structure was then displayed, and ambiguous NOESY signals were evaluated

Results
Sequence-specific resonance assignments 2D NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the 3D structure of conotoxin mr3e in aqueous solution at pH 3. Proton resonances for conotoxin mr3e were assigned using established methods [10]. Fourteen of the 16 spin systems were found in the `fingerprint' region of a 120 ms TOCSY spectrum. TOCSY assignments for Val1, Pro4, Phe5, His9, Leu11, Tyr13 and Asp16 were verified in the fingerprint region of a DQF-COSY spectrum. The sequential assignments of amino acids in the primary sequence started with the unique residues Leu11 and His9. A NOESY `walk' toward the N-terminus identified the residues from Leu11 to His9 and one toward the C-terminus identified the residues from Cys12 to Asp16. Two of the glycine spin systems identified in the TOCSY spectrum were encountered in a NOESY walk at positions 6 and 7. Residues from Cys2 to Cys8 were then assigned along the `walk'. The phenylalanine at position 5 was confirmed during the process. Pro4 was assigned by its TOCSY spin system and the NOEs from its a-proton to the amide proton of Phe5, and from its d-proton to the a-proton of

compared with those of the partially minimized structure. Twenty-one distance constraints were added on the basis of this analysis, and the minimization process was repeated to generate a set of 15 structures with a ° mean global rmsd of 0.69 A. dyana was used to provide hydrogen-bond information during the minimization. Deuterium-exchange studies indicated that hydrogen bonds might form exCysist between the amide protons of Gly7, Cys8 and Cys12 and nearby oxygen or nitrogen atoms. The resonances of amide protons in these residues were not diminished after 3 h in D2O at 294 K in a 1D proton time course experiment. dyana provided hydrogen bond acceptor oxygen and nitrogen atoms for each of the amide protons from these four residues. The hydrogen bonds for Gly7, Cys8 and Cys12 were used as constraints. Thus, six upper and six lower distance constraints were added for the hydrogen-bond interactions, and another round of minimization was performed. The result was a final set of 20 structures with ° a mean global backbone rmsd of 0.56 ± 0.16 A and a ° mean global heavy atom rmsd of 1.30 ± 0.28 A. Finally, refinement of the structure was carried out using amber 5 [12] for energy minimization. An ensemble of 20 structures with lower energy and better Ramachandran plots was chosen to represent the 3D solution fold of conotoxin mr3e and the mean structure was generated using molmol [13]. The program procheck was used to analyze the family of 20 struc2598

tures [14]. Structural statistics are shown in Table 2. The 20 structures converged to a common fold; the rmsd values of 20 structures are low. The coordinates for the family of 20 structures and NMR constraints file have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession number 2EFZ. 3D structure of mr3e Figure 3 shows an overlay of the backbone atoms for the 20 structures of mr3e. The overall rmsd reported ° for the final 20 structures (0.43 ± 0.19 A) is influenced by disorder in the C-terminal residue Asp16. When Asp16 is eliminated and the molecule is minimized by considering the first 15 residues only, the mean global ° backbone rmsd decreases from 0.43 to 0.24 A. Unlike the N-terminal portion, the C-terminal portion of the molecule is poorly resolved. The refined structure of conotoxin mr3e contains two turns defined by residues Phe5 to Cys8 and His9 to Cys12 (Fig. 4). The residues from Phe5 to Cys8 are characteristic of a type I b-turn with a glycine residue (Gly7) at position i+2. The glycine residue is required to accommodate the necessary angle constraints of the turn. The second turn in the region between His9 and Cys12 is apparently stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of His9 and the amide proton of Cys12. The interaction is characteristic of a type II b-turn.

Discussion
M-superfamily conotoxins, one of the major groups of disulfide-rich peptides, are widely distributed in the

venoms of all three feeding types of cone snails. Depending on the number of residues located in the last Cys loop, M-superfamily conotoxins have been provisionally divided into four branches, namely M-1, -2, -3, -4. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, three different disulfide linkages can be found in M-1 (1­5, 2­4, 3­6), M-2 (1­6, 2­4, 3­5) and M-4 (1­4, 2­5, 3­6) branch conotoxins, respectively. mr3e is an M-1 branch conotoxin purified from the venom of a mollusk-hunting cone snail, C. marmoreus; it has 16 amino acids in its mature peptide. Previously, we have shown that mr3e is characterized by its distinctive disulfide connectivity (C1­C5, C2­C4, C3­C6) [9], which is completely different from those of wellstudied l-, w- and jM-conotoxins (M-4 branch) and the recently reported, comparatively small, excitory M-superfamily conotoxins mr3a, mr3b and tx3c (M-2 branch). In this report, we show that there are two classic b-turns involved in the tertiary structure of mr3e (Fig. 6A). The backbone conformation of mr3e is different from that of the M-2 branch conotoxin mr3a, which possesses a distinctive triple-turn backbone structure motif (Fig. 6B) [15]. Such a triple-turn motif makes the mr3a molecule fold into a tight and globular structure (Fig. 6D). By contrast, the doubleturn motif of mr3e, which apparently results from its differing disulfide bond arrangement, gives the mr3e a more irregular overall molecular shape, with the side

Experimental procedures
Peptide synthesis and refolding
mr3e was chemically synthesized as described previously [9]. Linear peptide was oxidized by air in 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer and purified on a semi-preparative C18 reverse-phase column. The final product was coapplied with native mr3e to an analytical C18 reverse-phase column to verify its identity.

NMR experiments
Samples for NMR experiments were prepared at a concentration of  2.0 mm in either 99.99% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA, USA) or 9 : 1(v / v) H2O / D2O with 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, at pH 3.0. NMR measurements were performed using standard pulse sequences and phase cycling on a Bruker Avance 500 NMR spectrometer at 294 K. Proton DQF-COSY, NOESY and TOCSY spectra in 99.99% D2O and in 9 : 1 H2O / D2O (v / v) were acquired with the transmitter set at 4.80 p.p.m. and a spectral window of 6000 Hz. All 2D NMR spectra were acquired in a phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension. Presaturation during the relaxation delay period was used to solvent resonance. A series of NOESY spectra was acquired with mixing times of 400, 200, 150 100 and 50 ms. TOCSY spectra under both solvent conditions were acquired with a mixing time of 120 ms. Spectra were processed using xwinnmr or topspin software. Phase-shifted sine-squared window functions were applied before Fourier transformation, with shifts of 60 or 90 ° in both dimensions. Final matrix sizes were usually 2048 · 2048 real points. To identify the slow exchange of backbone amide protons, the sample lyophilized from a H2O solution was redissolved in D2O. 1D 1H spectra were measured after 5 min, and subsequently every 0.5 h up to 20 h. Chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl resonance of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid used as an internal standard.

chains of several amino acids protruding outside the molecule (Fig. 6C). In contrast to the typical excitory symptoms, such as circular movements, barrel rolling and convulsions, elicited by cranial injection of mr3a [3], mr3e has no obvious effect on mice [9]. Therefore, it is most likely that these two conotoxins have different physiological functions, and this is not surprising considering that they have completely different backbone scaffolds. Although M-1 and M-2 branch conotoxins are similar in size and cysteine framework, and are all abundant in mollusk- and worm-hunting cone snails, more evidence has emerged that they are phylogenetically divergent groups. These two groups of M-superfamily conotoxins differ with respect to signal peptide sequence, disulfide linkage, backbone scaffold and most likely molecular target. It seems to be a favored strategy of cone snails to generate different backbone scaffolds within conotoxins by introducing different disulfide linkages into conotoxins that share the same cysteine framework. For instance, a-conotoxin and v-conotoxin share the same `-CC-C-C-' cysteine framework, but differ greatly in disulfide linkage, backbone scaffold and consequently molecular target [16­18]. Such a strategy, which yields more structural and functional diversity in the conotoxins, will help cone snails to survive severe environmental pressures.

Distance restraints and structure calculations
An initial survey of distance constraints was performed on a series of NOESY spectra acquired at mixing times of 400, 200, 150, 100 and 50 ms. Build-up curves were produced which showed a leveling of the intensity of the NOE at mixing times > 200 ms. Quantitative determination of the cross-peak intensities was based on counting the contour levels. Off-diagonal resonances were classified as strong, medium or weak on the basis of their relative intensities and ° set to distance constraints of 1.8­2.5, 1.8­3.5, and 1.8­5.5 A, respectively. A set of 96 intra- and interproton distance restraints, representing unambiguously assigned dipolar

couplings, was generated from the data and used as input for dyana (V.1.5). Six u dihedral angles were determined on the basis of the 3JNHa coupling constants derived by analysis of a high resolution 1D proton spectrum of conotoxin mr3e. The u angle constraints were set to )120 ± 40° for 3JNHa > 8.0 Hz (Gly7, Glu10) and to )65 ± 25° for 3JNHa < 5.5 Hz (Cys3, Phe5, Leu11, Cys12). Backbone dihedral constraints were not applied for 3JNHa values between 5.5 and 8.0 Hz. After the initial calculation, hydrogen-bonds ° constraints were added as target values of 2.2 A for NH(i)­ ° for N(i)­O(j), respectively. O(j) and 3.2 A One thousand random structures were generated by dyana (v. 1.5) that fit the primary sequence and covalent and spatial requirements of mr3e. A total of 190 distance constraints, six u angle restraints and three hydrogen bonds constraints were input for the molecular modeling protocol for the dyana algorithm. The outcome was a set of 20 ° structures with a mean global rmsd of 0.56 ± 0.16 A and a ° mean global heavy atom rmsd of 1.30 ± 0.28 A. Structural refinement was carried out using amber 5 and structure quality was analyzed using molmol and procheck-nmr.
