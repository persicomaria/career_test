ABSTRACT: The shikimate biosynthetic pathway is essential to microorganisms, plants, and parasites but absent from mammals. Therefore, shikimate dehydrogenase (SD) and other enzymes in the pathway are attractive targets for developing nontoxic antimicrobial agents, herbicides, and antiparasite drugs. SD catalyzes the fourth reaction in the pathway, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate- (NADP-) dependent reduction of 3-dehydroshikimic acid to shikimic acid (SA), as well as its reverse, by the transfer of a hydride. Previous structural studies reveal that the enzyme exists in two major conformations, an open and a closed form. For the reaction to occur, it is believed that the catalytic complex assumes the closed conformation. Nonetheless, the only structure containing both SA and NADP+ exhibits an open conformation (PDB entry 2EV9). Here, we present two crystal structures of Aquifex aeolicus SD, including a ternary complex with both SA and NADP+, which assumes the closed conformation and therefore contains a catalytically competent active site. On the basis of preexisting and novel structural and biochemical data, a catalytic mechanism is proposed.

The shikimate pathway is a biosynthetic route leading to the synthesis of aromatic amino acids, folate cofactors, ubiquinone, and many secondary metabolites (1, 2). The pathway is essential to algae, plants, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, whereas it is absent from mammals (2, 3). Therefore, it is a target for the development of nontoxic antimicrobial agents (4), herbicides (3, 5), and antiparasite drugs (6, 7). In addition, the pathway has been used for industrial production of hydroaromatic intermediates (8, 9). The shikimate pathway contains seven reactions each catalyzed by an enzyme, including 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, 3-dehydroquinase, shikimate dehydrogenase (SD),1

shikimate kinase, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase, and chorismate synthase. Three-dimensional structures are available for representatives of all seven enzymes. 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase has been an effective target for the development of nontoxic herbicide glyphosate (10). However, after more than 20 years of extensive usage, glyphosate-resistant weeds have recently emerged (11, 12), underlining the importance of target diversity. To date, three classes of SD have been identified and characterized, AroE, YdiB, and SD-like proteins (SD-L). AroE (EC 1.1.1.25) catalyzes the fourth reaction in the shikimate pathway, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate- (NADP-) dependent reduction of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHSA) to shikimic acid (SA) (Figure 1A). YdiB (EC 1.1.1.282) is a bifunctional enzyme; it also catalyzes the reversible reduction of dehydroquinate to quinate in the presence of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). SD-L catalyzes the oxidation of SA only but with an 1000-fold lower rate when compared with that of AroE (13, 14). Since 2003, a total of 14 crystal structures of SD have been reported, including PDB (15) entries 1NPD (16), 1O9B and 1NYT (13), 1NVT (17), 1P74 and 1P77 (18), 1NPY (14), 1VI2 (19), 2GPT (20), and 1WXD, 2CY0, 2D5C, 2EV9, and 2NLO (primary citation not available). These structures have revealed the highly conserved overall architecture of these enzymes, featuring (i) the general fold of the polypeptide chain, the N-terminal catalytic domain containing a unique R/ fold and the C-terminal NAD(P)binding domain comprising the Rossmann fold, (ii) two distinct conformations of the overall structure, an open form and a closed form, (iii) the protein-NAD(P) and protein-

Secondary structure elements are indicated by pink spirals for R-helices, red arrows for -strands, and yellow pipes for loops.

The composite annealed omit maps (2Fo - Fc, contoured at the 1.0 level) are shown for the enzyme-bound NADP+ (C) and SA (D) molecules.

SA interactions, and (iv) conserved active site residues K70 and D106 [residue numbers in Aquifex aeolicus SD AroE (AaSD)], which are hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl groups of SA. It is intriguing that in vitro data have shown that the two conserved residues play distinct roles in these enzymes: they are key catalytic groups in AroE (20) and SD-L (14) but are important only for substrate binding in YdiB (21). To elucidate the catalytic mechanisms of AroE, YdiB, and SD-L, catalytically competent ternary complexes of each class containing both a cofactor and a substrate are critical. Among the 14 structures, however, only a Thermus thermophilus SD AroE (TtSD) structure contains both NADP+ and

SA (TtSD,NADP+,SA, 2EV9). Unfortunately, this ternary complex exhibits the open conformation with an exposed active site, in which the redox reaction is not likely to occur. Here, we present the results of our biochemical analysis and two crystal structures of AaSD. Our structure of the ternary AaSD,NADP+,SA complex has the closed conformation with a catalytically competent active center and, therefore, provides critical insight into the mechanism of AroEcatalyzed hydride transfer. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification. We expressed the AaSD in two forms, wild type and His tagged. For the wild

Catalytic Center Assembly of SD AroE type, the gene for AaSD was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of A. aeolicus kindly provided by Dr. Ronald V. Swanson of Diversa Corp. and cloned into the expression vector pET-17b (Novagen) by standard recombinant DNA methods. The forward and reverse primers for the PCR amplification were 5-GGAATTCATATGATTAACGCCCAAACGCAGCTATACGGAG-3 and 5-CGGAATTCTTACCCACGGAGATCTCTTACAGATCTTTCTGC-3, respectively. The coding sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) containing the expression construct pET-17b-AaSD was used to produce AaSD. The cells were grown overnight without IPTG induction, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and broken with a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 27000g for 20 min. The supernatant was heated to 65 °C for 30 min, centrifuged again, and loaded on to a DEAE-cellulose column linked to an Affi-Gel Blue column both equilibrated with the Tris buffer. The Affi-Gel Blue column was washed with the Tris buffer until OD280 ) 0.05 and then eluted with a linear 0-1.0 M NaCl gradient in the same buffer. The fractions containing AaSD were identified by SDS-PAGE. The pure fractions were concentrated with an Amicon cell using a YM10 membrane, dialyzed against the buffer containing 1 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl, and lyophilized. For the His-tagged protein, the AaSD gene was cloned into a modified pET-17b vector to generate an AaSD with a six histidine tag at the N-terminus. The protein was first purified with an Affi-Gel Blue column as described above but without the heating step and DEAE-cellulose precolumn. The Affi-Gel Blue column was eluted with a linear 0-1.5 M NaCl gradient in the Tris buffer. The AaSD fractions from the Affi-Gel Blue column were loaded onto a Ni-NTA column equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0). The Ni-NTA column was washed with 20 mM imidazole in the phosphate buffer and eluted with 250 mM imidazole in the same buffer. The pure His-tagged AaSD fractions were concentrated, dialyzed, and lyophilized as described for the non-His-tagged AaSD. Biochemical Analysis. Kinetic measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM MES, and 100 mM NaCl, which was designed for minimizing the variation of ionic strength for the determination of the pH profile of the kinetic parameters. The reaction was followed by monitoring the formation of NADPH and DHSA spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mM-1 cm-1. The SD activity was usually assayed at pH 9.0 under the initial velocity conditions. For the determination of the Km of SA (Km(SA)), NADP+ was fixed at 1 mM and SA was varied from 0.008 to 0.3 mM. For the determination of the Km of NADP+ (Km(NADP)), SA was fixed at 2 mM and NADP+ was varied from 0.004 to 0.18 mM. For the determination of the pH profile of the kinetic parameters, NADP+ was fixed at 1 mM and SA was varied generally in the range of 0.5 Km(SA) to 10 Km(SA). Kinetic constants were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of the kinetic data using the program Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) and the MichaelisMenten equation:

Crystals of native (apo-AaSD) and its Hg derivative (AaSD, Hg) were obtained with non-His-tagged protein, whereas the ternary complex (AaSD,NADP+,SA) crystals were obtained with His-tagged AaSD. Before crystallization, non-His-tagged AaSD was dialyzed for 4 h in 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 500 mM NaCl, concentrated to 16.3 mg/mL, and injected into a Superdex 75 10/30 column (Pharmacia). The column was calibrated using a SEC molecular weight standard kit from Bio-Rad, and the calibration data were fit to a straight line with r2 > 0.999. The sample was eluted using the same buffer, and the collected fraction was concentrated to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Single crystals were grown with the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at well-controlled room temperature (19 ( 1 °C). The precipitant (well) solution contained 12% PEG 20000 in 0.1 M MES (pH 6.4-6.6). The drops contained equal volumes of the protein and the well solutions. The AaSD,Hg crystal was obtained via soaking an apo-AaSD crystal in the mother liquid containing 0.1 mM ethyl mercuric phosphate for 24 h. Both the native and the HgMAD data were collected at Beamline X9B of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Labortory, using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. During data collection, the crystal was kept frozen at 100 K with an Oxford cryocooling system. The cryocondition was 24-25% PEG 400. The derivative crystal was too small to provide a fluorescent spectrum; four recommended wavelengths for HgMAD data collection were used (22). The AaSD,NADP+,SA crystal was grown from hanging drops, each being created by mixing 3.0 µL of protein solution (20 mg/mL His-tagged AaSD, 5.0 mM NADP+, and 5.0 mM SA in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) and 1.0 µL of well solution (0.2 M ammonium acetate and 30% w/v PEG 4000 in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6). X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) insertion device beamline 22-ID of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Data processing was carried out with HKL2000 (23). Crystal data and processing statistics are summarized in Table 2. Further data processing was carried out with CCP4 program suite (24) for structure solution and refinement. Structure Solution and Refinement. Four Hg sites were obtained using the program SOLVE (25) at 2.5 Å resolution. The heavy atom parameters were refined, and phase im-

DNA sequencing indicates that residue 195 is a Glu and residue 233 is a Leu. These two residues are different from those in the database, in which residue 195 is a Lys and residue 233 is a Phe (Swiss-Prot entry 067049). We believe that these differences are due to errors in the genomic sequencing because (i) we have sequenced several independent clones from different PCR reactions and the results are consistent, (ii) the DNA polymerase used in our cloning work has high fidelity, and (iii) the new identities of the two residues are confirmed by electron density (difference map) during crystal structure determination. These two residues are more than 17 Å away from the catalytic site, and therefore their identities should not have significant influence on catalysis. Structures of Apo-AaSD and AaSD,NADP+,SA. The statistics for the two structures are summarized in Table 1. There are eight and four crystallographically independent AaSD molecules in the asymmetric unit of apo-AaSD and AaSD,NADP+,SA, respectively. The apo-AaSD structure contains 2125 amino acids (residues 1-266 for molecules A, B, D, E, G, and H, residues 1-265 for molecule C, and residues 1-264 for molecule F) and 639 water molecules. The AaSD,NADP+,SA structure contains 1068 amino acids (residues 1-269 for molecule A, residues 1-267 for molecules B, and residues 1-266 for molecules C and D), four NADP+ molecules (except that the nicotinamide and ribose moieties of NADP+ associated with molecule A are disordered and therefore not included), four SA molecules, assuming an identical half-chair conformation with a 3R,4S,5R arrangement, and 204 water molecules. The overall structure of molecule D in the AaSD,NADP+, SA structure is illustrated, and the electron density (2Fo Fc composite annealed omit map contoured at 1.0) for the two ligands is shown (Figure 1). The polypeptide chain folds into two domains, an NADP-binding domain and a catalytic domain. The NADP-binding domain, composed of amino acid residues 106-241, belongs to the superfamily of NAD(P)-binding, Rossmann-fold-containing domains. It features a six-stranded parallel -sheet ( 9, 8, 7, 10, 11, and

provement with solvent flipping was carried out using the program SHARP (26), resulting in an electron density map with recognizable secondary structure elements. The crystal structures of E. coli YdiB (PDB entries 1NPD and 1O9B) facilitated model building although the molecular replacement attempts using the two structures as search models were not successful. Both the apo-AaSD and AaSD,NADP+,SA structures were solved with the molecular replacement program PHASER (27) using the AaSD,Hg structure (PDB entry 2HK7) as the search model after the Hg atoms and solvent molecules were removed. The refinement was done with CNS (28). Bulk solvent correction was employed. During the refinement, the 2Fo Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps were regularly inspected and compared with the initial electron density map from HgMAD phasing. Solvent molecules, as peaks g3.0 on the Fo - Fc map with reasonable hydrogen bond network, were included as water molecules at the later stage of the refinement and verified with omit maps. During the refinement, only weak noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to the CR atoms of the eight molecules in the apo-AaSD structure. Approximately 5% reflections were randomly selected for R-free calculations throughout the refinement. All graphics work was carried out with O (29). The refined structures were assessed with PROCHECK (30)

The ligands are shown as stick models in atomic color scheme (C, green; O, red; N, blue; and P, orange) and outlined with a mesh representation at van der Waals radii of atoms. The protein is illustrated as a gray surface. The incomplete structure of SA is due to clipping.

12) flanked by three R-helices (R5, R6, and R7) on one side and one R-helix (R8) and two 310 helices on the other side of the sheet. The catalytic domain contains residues 1-105 and 242-269. It also contains a six-stranded -sheet ( 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 4; all parallel except 5) and is flanked on each side by three R-helices (R1, R9, and R10; R2, R3, and R4). The two domains are linked to each other by two helices, R5 and R9. A deep groove is formed between the two domains in which the cofactor NADP+ and substrate SA are located (Figure 1B). Open and Closed Conformations. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the CR positions in the eight copies of apo-AaSD ranges from 0.20 to 0.65 Å; comparatively, molecule F is more open than others. The RMSD between the four copies of AaSD,NADP+,SA ranges from 0.32 to 0.81 Å; relatively, molecule D exhibits the most closed conformation with lowest average B-factors and best electron density for the ligands. Alignment for individual domains results in much smaller RMSDs.

When molecule F of apo-AaSD and molecule D of AaSD, NADP+,SA are superimposed based on the CR trace alignment of their NADP-binding domains, a 4.8 Å shift of the loop linking 1 and R1 is observed between the open and the closed conformation of AaSD. Similar shifts are observed for the loop between 2 and R2 and that between 3 and R3 (not shown). The AaSD,NADP+,SA Structure Represents the Catalytic Complex. In the AaSD,NADP+,SA structure (closed form), the SA and NADP+ are brought into close contact in a sealed cavity; the C3-O3 bond of SA is parallel with the C4-C5 bond of the nicotinamide ring of NADP+, and the distance between the two bonds is 3.5 Å (Figure 2A). In the TtSD, NADP+,SA structure (open form), however, the SA molecule shifts away from NADP+ by 1.5 Å, allowing two water molecules to wedge in between the SA and the NADP+ nicotinamide (not shown). Therefore, the TtSD,NADP+,SA structure (PDB entry 2EV9) is not catalytically competent, whereas our AaSD,NADP+,SA structure represents the

9518 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 33, 2007 catalytic complex, in which atom C3 of the substrate is positioned to donate a hydride to (or to receive a hydride from) atom C4 of the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor. In spite of that, apparently, the reaction did not occur. The crystallization of the AaSD,NADP+,SA complex is probably due to the low activity of the enzyme and the equilibrium constant favoring the formation of SA and NADP+, both of which are caused by the low pH. The equilibrium constant ([SA][NADP+]/[DHSA][NADPH]) at 30 °C was determined by Yaniv and Gilvarg (34) to be 27.7 at pH 7 and 5.7 at pH 7.8 and by Balinsky and corworkers (35) to be 9.25 at pH 7.4. As of any dehydrogenase reaction, the equilibrium position of the AaSD-catalyzed reaction is dependent on the hydrogen ion concentration of the environment. A low pH environment favors the formation of SA and NADP+, whereas a high pH condition favors the formation of DHSA and NADPH (Figure 1A). Thus, the SDcatalyzed oxidation of SA is assayed usually at or near pH 9 (13, 14, 20, 21, 36). In our crystallization experiment, the pH values for the protein and well solution were 7.2 and 4.6, respectively, giving rise to an immediate acidic environment when the two solutions were mixed for crystallization. The pH value in the drops became even lower during the crystallization process because the drop (4 µL volume) was equilibrated with the well solution (1 mL volume) in a closed system. The equilibrium constant at pH 5 is estimated to be 3000 in favor of the formation of SA and NADP+. The apparent kcat at pH 5 was determined to be 0.22 s-1, which is 0.36% of that at pH 9 as described in a later section. Thus, in the crystallization mother liquor, NADP+ and SA are the majority species when compared with NADPH and DHSA. The crystallization of the AaSD,NADP+,SA complex further moves the equilibrium in favor of the formation of NADP+ and SA (Figure 1A). Although the geometry of NADP+ is not distinguishable from that of the NADPH at this resolution (Figure 1C), the geometry of SA, characterized by a tetrahedral (sp3) C3 (Figure 1D), is distinct from that of DHSA, in which the geometry of C3 is planar (sp2). Catalytic Center Assembly. The binding of cofactor NADP+ to SD has been previously described in detail in several binary complexes of the enzyme and the cofactor (13, 16, 17, 19). Briefly, the backbone amide groups of the P-loop act as donors of hydrogen bonds to the diphosphate and the 3-hydroxyl of the adenine ribose moiety of NADP+. The loop between 8 and R7 contains two conserved residues, Asn153 and Arg154, which are involved in the binding of the adenosine moiety. The 2-phosphate is further stabilized by two hydrogen bonds between phosphate oxygen and the guanidinium group of Arg154. The amide group of the nicotinamide forms two hydrogen bonds with main-chain atoms of Ile214 and Gly235. In addition, the ribose interacts with the protein via indirect hydrogen bonds. All of these interactions are observed in the AaSD,NADP+,SA structure, indicating that NADP+ binding is conserved and not significantly altered by the conformational change of the protein. Unlike NADP+, the SA molecule shifts significantly when the protein closes up. In the following sections, the SA binding will be described mainly on the basis of our AaSD,NADP+,SA structure (closed form). The SA-binding site is a pocket between the central -sheet of the catalytic domain and the flanking helices R1 and R9, in which the SA molecule is surrounded by R9 and three

Gan et al. loops (between 1 and R1, 3 and R3, and 6 and R5, respectively), and the entrance of the pocket is blocked by the nicotinamide moiety of NADP+ (Figure 1B). The carboxylate group of SA is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl groups of Ser19, Ser21, and Tyr216 (Figure 2B). Residues Ser19 and Ser21, highly conserved in the SD family, form two hydrogen bonds with one of the two carboxylate oxygen atoms of SA, while Tyr216 forms a hydrogen bond with the other carboxylate oxygen. Tyr216, also conserved among SD sequences but to a lesser degree, is located in the NADPbinding domain, but its side chain projects into the SAbinding pocket, forming a strong hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of SA. The three hydroxyl groups of SA interact extensively with the protein (Figures 2B and 4). The C4-hydroxyl forms two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of highly conserved residues Asn91 and Asp106, the C5hydroxyl forms two hydrogen bonds with Asn64 and Gln242, and the C3-hydroxyl forms two hydrogen bonds with Lys70 and Thr66. Residues Lys70 and Asp106 are highly conserved among SD sequences (21); a salt bridge (2.9 Å) is formed between the two side chains. The stereospecific oxidation (or reduction) of SA (or DHSA) by NADP+ (or NADPH) is known to occur from the A-side of the cofactor (37), and during the reaction, atom C3 of the substrate must be positioned to donate (or receive) a hydride to (or from) atom C4 of the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor. From the open to the closed form, three loops in the catalytic domain move toward the NADP-binding domain by 5 Å and thereby seal the active center of the enzyme. In the AaSD,NADP+,SA structure, the C3-O3 bond of SA is positioned parallel with the C4-C5 bond of the nicotinamide moiety of NADP+ in a close proximity (3.5 Å, Figure 2A). Thus, the C4 of the NADP+ nicotinamide is positioned to receive a hydride from C3 of SA, which is 2.4 Å away (not shown), in agreement with the theoretically predicted distance (2.2-2.6 Å) for the arrangement of reactants in the liver alcohol dehydrogenase (38, 39). In the AaSD,NADP+,SA structure, we have identified a water molecule located near the side chains of Lys70 and Asp106 (Figure 2B). It is conserved in all 12 chains of the two structures reported here. It was also observed in 24 out of 33 chains of 13 previously reported SD structures (PDB entries 1NPD, 1O9B, 1NYT, 1NVT, P74, 1P77, 1NPY, 1VI2 1WXD, 2CY0, 2D5C, 2EV9, and 2EZ3). This water molecule is enclosed in a cavity rendered by six residues (Lys70, Ala89, Asn91, Asn104, Gly133, and Ala 137) with optimized electrostatic interactions as well as van der Waals contacts with the protein (Figure 2B). It reaches the C3 oxygen of SA via a proton-conducting wire through the Asp106-Lys70 pair. It also has access to the bulk solvent through either Asn104 or Gly133. Therefore, this water molecule is in position to facilitate proton transfer during the oxidation-reduction reaction. Biochemical Analysis. The SD activity was measured in the direction of the formation of NADPH and DHSA. Steadystate kinetic parameters were first measured at pH 9.0 for comparison with those of other SDs, because most of the reported kinetic analyses of SDs were carried out at or near this pH (13, 14, 20, 21, 36). The values of the apparent kinetic parameters of AaSD are listed together with those of some bacterial SDs in Table 3. AaSD is rather active for an enzyme from a hyperthermophile that grows best near

95 °C (40). The kcat of AaSD is comparable to those of mesophilic enzymes from E. coli (13), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (36), and Helicobacter pylori (41). The Km values for both SA and NADP+ are also comparable to those of the mesophilic enzymes. The SD from another hyperthermophile, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, with an optimal growth temperature at 83 °C has been characterized (42). Its kcat was determined to be 390 s-1 at 87 °C and pH 7.3, and we estimated it to be 2.5 s-1 at 25 °C based on the reported activation energy for the enzyme (42). For comparison, the kcat of AaSD at 25 °C and pH 7.3 is 22 s-1, which is significantly high than that of the SD from A. fulgidus. To determine the effects of pH on the activity of AaSD, we determined the pH profile of the kinetic parameters for SA at the saturating concentration of NADP+ (1 mM). As mentioned earlier, pH has dramatic effects on the activity of the enzyme. The kcat of AaSD at pH 5 is only 0.36% of that at pH 9. The kcat-pH profile (Figure 3A) is characteristic of an enzyme with a residue that functions as a general base for catalysis. The apparent pKa estimated from the kinetic measurements was 7.5 ( 0.1. On the basis of the structure described earlier, the residue that most likely functions as a general base is Lys70. The apparent pKa value is similar to that (8.1) of the corresponding lysine residue in Haemophilus influenza SD-L estimated from a similar pH profile (14) but is significantly different from that (8.9) of the corresponding lysine residue in M. tuberculosis SD obtained for the reverse reaction (i.e., the formation of SA and NADP+) (43). It is not clear at present whether the differences in the apparent pKa values are caused by the local environments of the lysine or the different degrees of the "stickness" of the substrate relative to catalytic turnover. The kcat/Km-pH profile (Figure 3B), different from the kcat-pH profile (Figure 3A), is characteristic for those of two ionizable groups, one of which needs to be deprotonated and the other needs to be protonated for optimal activity. The apparent pKa values were estimated to be 6.7 ( 0.1 and 9.7 ( 0.1, respectively, by nonlinear regression analysis as described in the Experimental Procedures section. The residue with a pKa of 6.7 could be either Lys70 or Asp106 based on the structure as both residues are hydrogen bonded to SA. Alternatively, this apparent pKa value may reflect the effects of the ionization of both residues on the binding of SA and/or subsequent catalysis. The residue with a pKa of 9.7 is most likely Tyr216, which is hydrogen bonded to the carboxyl group of SA. When the phenolyl group of Tyr216 is deprotonated, it is expected to decrease the affinity of the enzyme for SA significantly. Proposed Mechanism. On the basis of our structural and biochemical analyses described here and those reported by

others, we propose a catalytic mechanism for AaSD as depicted in Figure 4. The active enzyme for the dehydrogenation of SA (Figure 4A) contains a deprotonated lysine (Lys70), a deprotonated aspartate (Asp106), and a protonated tyrosine (Tyr216). The hydride transfer and the deprotonation of the 3-hydroxyl group of SA are suggested to proceed in a concerted manner based on the measurements of kinetic isotope effects on the M. tuberculosis SD-catalyzed reaction (43). Lys70 functions as a general base and becomes protonated in the dehydrogenation reaction (Figure 4B). The proton is then transferred to the bulk solvent via the short proton-conducting wire. Although the proposed mechanism of proton transfer is depicted as a stepwise process in Figure 4, it can be a concerted process. In either case, Asp106 plays a critical role in the transfer of a proton to the bulk solvent. While the three types of SDs (AroE, YdiB, and SD-L) have the same fold, their active centers are significantly different. Although they all can catalyze the SD reaction, the SD reaction may be only a side activity for YdiB and SD-L, with a reported kcat of 0.1 s-1 for E. coli YdiB (21) and 0.2 s-1 for H. influenza SD-L (14). YdiB can catalyze the dehydrogenation of quinate and is believed to be involved in quinate catabolism (13) or a branch point enzyme for quinate biosynthesis from the shikimate pathway (14). Furthermore, unlike AroE and SD-L, which use exclusively NADP as their cofactor, YdiB prefers NAD to NADP for the dehydrogenation of both quinate and shikimate (13). On the basis of the structural comparison of E. coli AroE and YdiB, the NAD preference of YdiB is attributed to the

Hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines and electron flows by curved arrows. The hydride transfer is concerted with the deprotonation of the 3-hydroxyl group of SA (A to B). The proton transfer from Lys70 to the bulk solvent is proposed to be facilitated by Asp106 (C and D).

substitution of T151 and R154 in AroE by D158 and F160 in YdiB, respectively (13). The biological function of SD-L is not known at present, but it is believed to be involved in a new branch from the shikimate pathway (14). The low SD activities of YdiB and SD-L are caused by active site residue substitutions, but a more precise description has to wait until the structures of YdiB and SD-L in complex with shkimate are determined. The substitutions not only cause the exchange of functional groups of the substituted residues but also may alter the function of the conserved residues because of the repositioning of their side chains as a consequence of the substitution of other residues. For example, R150 in AroE corresponds to R158 in YdiB, and the residue is conserved between the two enzymes, but the position of the guanidinium group of R150 in AroE is significantly different from that of R158 in YdiB. Consequently, the guanidinium group of R150 in AroE forms two hydrogen bonds with the 2phosphate, but the guanidinium group of R158 in YdiB is not in a position to interact with the ribose moiety of NAD. Similarly, the positions of the conserved aspartate and lysine residues relative to the bound shikimate may be different among AroE, YdiB, and SD-L and consequently have different functions. Thus, substitution of the conserved lysine residue (Lys71) in E. coli YdiB with Ala caused only a decrease in kcat by a factor of 8 but an increase in Km for SA by a factor of 180 (21). Surprisingly, substitution of the

corresponding aspartate residue (Asp107) in YdiB with Ala caused a small increase in kcat but a dramatic decrease in Km for SA (by a factor of 1.4 × 104). For both mutations, the Km values for NAD are similar to that of the wild-type YdiB. Although the rate constants for individual steps are not known for any SD, the chemical step is most likely ratelimiting for the YdiB-catalyzed SA dehydrogenation reaction, because its kcat value for the reaction is extremely low (21). The results taken together strongly suggest that (1) the conserved lysine residue in YdiB plays only a minor role in catalysis and is more important for the binding of SA and (2) the conserved aspartate residue is critically important for the binding of SA but is not important for catalysis. In contrast, substitution of the corresponding lysine residue (Lys385) in the Arabidopsis dehydroquinate dehydrataseshikimate dehydrogenase with Ala resulted in a decrease in kcat by a factor of 3.3 × 104 and a decrease in Km by about 2-fold, suggesting that the lysine residue plays a critical role in catalysis. Substitution of the corresponding aspartate residue (Asp423) with Asn caused a decrease in kcat by a factor of 3.5 × 103 and essentially no change in Km. However, the carboxamide of the asparagine residue may be able to maintain the hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxyl group of SA. When the aspartate residue was substituted with Ala, the mutation rendered an enzyme with no measurable activity, suggesting that the aspartate residue is also critically

Catalytic Center Assembly of SD AroE important for catalysis. The site-directed mutagenesis studies of the Arabidopsis enzyme also suggests that the deprotonation of the 3-hydroxyl group of SA plays a major role in the oxidation of SA. Mutagenesis studies of the conserved aspartate and lysine residues in H. influenza SD-L also indicate that the two residues are critical for its SD activity. On the basis of the crystal structures reported in this paper, we suggest that Lys70 in AaSD plays mainly a catalytic role as a general base for the deprotonation of the 3-hydroxyl group of SA in the oxidation of SA. Asp106 is important for both the binding of SA and the catalysis as a mediator for the proton transfer from Lys70 to the bulk solvent. The proposed functional roles of these important residues await site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Zbigniew Dauter, John J.
