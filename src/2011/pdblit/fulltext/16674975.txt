Abstract The enzyme L -rhamnulose kinase from Escherichia coli participates in the degradation pathway of L -rhamnose, a common natural deoxy-hexose. The structure of the enzyme in a ternary complex with its substrates ADP and L -rhamnulose ∞ has been determined at 1.55 A resolution and refined to Rcryst/Rfree values of 0.179/0.209. The result was compared with the lower resolution structure of a corresponding complex containing L -fructose instead of L -rhamnulose. In light of the two established sugar positions and conformations, a number of rare sugars have been modeled into the active center of L -rhamnulose kinase and the model structures have been compared with the known enzymatic phosphorylation rates. Rare sugars are of rising interest for the synthesis of bioactive compounds. ” 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

2. Materials and methods
The substrate L -rhamnulose-1-phosphate was produced by an aldol condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and lactaldehyde using L -rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase [11,12]. The reaction mixture contained 2.4 mmol dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 6 mmol D /L -lactaldehyde in 180 ml buffer of 20 mM Tris≠HCl, pH 7.2. The reaction was started by adding 1.7 lmol (50 mg) of the aldolase and ran at 37 ∞C for 2 h. The protein was removed by denaturation (95 ∞C, 5 min) and centrifugation. The solution was concentrated and run through a silicagel column (Silicagel 60, Merck Darmstadt) using a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of iso-propanol and saturated NH3 in water. The product L -rhamnulose-1-phosphate was identified by thin-layer chromatography, confirmed by 1H and 31P NMR, separated and dried using a rotary evaporator. Since the charge removal at three surface residues in RhuK mutant E69A-E70A-R73A gave rise to well-ordered crystals [6], we kept these mutations in the reported analysis. The triple mutant was overexpressed in E. coli JM105 and purified as described [6]. The protein was dialyzed against 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol and concentrated to 20 mg/ ml. Co-crystallization was carried out at 20 ∞C using the hanging drop method. The drops consisted of 2 ll of a solution of 12 mg/ml protein, 20 mM ADP and 20 mM L -rhamnulose-1-phosphate (unbuffered) and 2 ll of the reservoir containing 17% (w/v) PEG 8000 and 120 mM LiCl (unbuffered). Crystals grew to maximum sizes of about 300 ∑ 150 ∑ 100 lm3 within three days. For X-ray analysis, the crystals were transferred to 34% (w/v) PEG 8000 with 120 mM LiCl and shockfrozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Swiss Light Source (SLS, Villigen, Switzerland) and processed with XDS [13]. Using REFMAC5 [14] an initial model was obtained by rigid body refinement of the established RhuK structure (PDB code 2CGL). The substrate L rhamnulose was generated with PRODRG2 [15] and introduced into the model. Water molecules were added with ARP/wARP [16]. The model was improved with COOT [17] and refined with REFMAC5. Models of the rare sugars were produced with PRODRG2 [15] starting from the furanose conformation observed for L -fructose [6] and L rhamnulose bound to RhuK. They were manually placed using COOT [17]. The figures were prepared using POVscript [18] and POVRAY (http://www.povray.org). The coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the Protein Data Bank accession code 2UYT.

1. Introduction In numerous plants the sugar L -rhamnose is a frequent cell wall constituent [1] that is metabolized by various bacteria, among them Escherichia coli [2,3]. In E. coli the respective operon is composed of L -rhamnose permease, L -rhamnose isomerase, L rhamnulose kinase (RhuK, EC 2.7.1.5), L -rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase and two regulatory proteins [4]. Here, we are concerned with the kinase that uses ATP to phosphorylate the sugar. The reaction results in L -rhamnulose-1-phosphate, which is then split by the aldolase into L -lactaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate [5]. RhuK belongs to the hexokinase-actin-hsp70 family exhibiting the characteristic b-sheet in an N-terminal as well as a C-terminal domain and the ATP binding site in a cleft between the two domains [6]. The similarity is significant indicating a common evolutionary origin [7]. A comparison between holo and apo structures of RhuK showed a large induced-fit during substrate binding involving a relative rotation of about 10∞ between the N- and C-terminal domains [6]. Kinases require such a conformational change to exclude water, which would otherwise compete for the phosphoryl group. An induced-fit was initially observed for hexokinase [8]. For the ATP hydrolases actin and hsp70, a corresponding rotation on phosphoryl transfer serves as a conformational signal [9] or as a power stroke [10].

3. Results and discussion RhuK is a monomer with a mass of 54 110 Da comprising two approximately equal sized domains, each containing a characteristic five-stranded b-sheet covered on both sides by helices [6]. The known structure of residues 2≠480 and ADP was placed into the crystal unit cell. After adding b-L -rhamnulose and water mole∞ cules, the model was refined to 1.55 A resolution yielding good quality indices (Table 1). Given the high resolution, 14 residues were observed in double conformations. None of them was in the active center. ADP and the natural substrate L -rhamnulose were well outlined by the electron density. Since the average B-factors of both substrates matched that of the surrounding protein,

The adenine moiety of ADP binds in a non-polar crevice made up of Leu315, Pro316 and Ile319 on one side, and Gly402, Gly403 and Gln405 on the other. The ribose binds with its 3 0 -hydroxyl group to Gln304-Ne. The conformation of the diphosphate moiety is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to backbone amides and side-chains from the two b-hairpins around positions 14 and 259, as well as from Gly402-N. The bound ADP corresponds closely to that of the L -fructose complex [6] except for the b-phosphoryl, which is rotated about 25∞ around the Pb≠ ∞ Oab bond. As a consequence the bc-bridge oxygen is at a 4.5 A distance from the 1-hydroxyl nucleophile of the bound L ∞ rhamnulose, which is 0.2 A shorter than observed in the L -fructose complex, corroborating the associative type of phosphoryl transfer [20]. As shown in Fig. 1, the c-phosphoryl group can be modeled in a staggered conformation between nucleophile and leaving group in an ideal geometry for a direct in-line transfer. The sugar L -rhamnulose was bound in the cleft at the same position as L -fructose (Fig. 1, Table 2). Its 6-methyl group fitted well into a non-polar pocket formed by Gly83, Val84, Tyr102 and Phe134 from the N-domain (Fig. 2). The hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds to His236, Asp237, Thr238, Asn296, and via two water molecules to Glu284, all from the C-domain. The 1-hydroxyl group of L -rhamnulose is hydrogen-bonded to Asp237 functioning as the catalytic base. The binding site is virtually the same as observed with the L -fructose complex [6]. Whereas its natural phosphoryl acceptor is L -rhamnulose, activity data suggested that RhuK plays a role in the metabolism of quite a number of `rare sugars' [21], phosphorylating a broad spectrum of 2-ketoses [12,19,22]. In Table 2, we list the 16 ketoses tested for RhuK activity and state their steric rela-

the sites were considered fully occupied. The substrate binding structure is shown in Fig. 1. The co-crystallization experiment with ADP and L -rhamnulose-1-phosphate but without the divalent cation required for catalysis [12,19] were designed to show RhuK in complex with the reactants. Unfortunately, the transferred phosphoryl group was missing in the crystal. A disordered phosphate was ruled out because the corresponding space was filled by well-ordered water molecules. We conclude that the phosphoryl group was hydrolyzed during crystallization.

The (Fo ¿ Fc)-difference electron density map of ADP and b-L -rhamnulose is shown at the 3.5 r contour level. Some residues and their interactions are shown. Hydrogen bonds are indicated as broken lines. The c-phosphoryl group before the transfer (pink) is modeled into the trigonal bipyramid describing the transfer reaction. The presence of the modeled Mg2+ ion (pink) at the expected position between the b- and c-phosphoryl groups most likely causes a rearrangement of the water molecules.

We observed the 2S-configuration in both structurally established complexes with RhuK and used it throughout for modeling. The 5-residue makes tight contacts in the non-polar pocket formed by Gly83, Val84, Tyr102 and Phe134. c The 5-hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond to Gly83-O. d The 4-hydroxyl loses its hydrogen bonds to Asn296 but finds a reasonably large low-polarity pocket. e The 3-hydroxyl protrudes into a narrow pocket and loses its hydrogen bonds to His236, Thr238 and water molecule II.

tion to the prime substrate L -rhamnulose. Since L -rhamnulose and L -fructose assume the S-configuration at the C2 atom (banomer) when bound to RhuK and since RhuK obviously requires the R-configuration at the C3 atom (Table 2), we suggest that all 2-ketoses bind as 2S-anomers, which are the aand b-anomers in the D - and L -series, respectively. The 2Ranomer would not fit the binding site (Fig. 2). Accordingly, we modeled all sugars as 2S-anomers manually into the active center so that the catalytic base Asp237 forms hydrogen bonds to the 1- as well as to the 2-hydroxyls. Given this fit, the remainder of the sugars is spatially rather restricted so that we refrained from using docking programs, but positioned the sugars by mere rotation/translation. None of the modeled ∞ sugars forms a hydrogen bond shorter than 2.5 A or a van-der∞ Waals contact closer than 3.5 A, indicating that the models are consistent with binding to a slightly relaxed protein. The fits explain the observed activities [12,19,22] rather well. In particular, we show in Fig. 2 multiple hydrogen bonds around the 3R-hydroxyl, which are lost in the 3S-epimer. The surrounding water molecule I is suspended from Tyr102 and polarizes the nucleophile. Water molecules II and III are held by Glu284 (forming a buried saltbridge to Arg292) and promote binding of the 3and 4-hydroxyls. All sugar models are compatible with the three bound water molecules although in some cases their 3- and 4hydroxyls make close contacts to them. However, a contact with bound water is rather easily relaxed, in particular when it is (like molecule III) backed up by other water. The residue at the C5 atom of the sugar seems to be of lesser importance as it faces a non-polar pocket formed by Gly83, Val84, Tyr102 and Phe134. In summary, the data of Table 2 show rather clearly that the configuration at the C3 atom is most important for activity. Actually the configuration at C2 is equally decisive (Fig. 2) but for a 2-ketose the 2S-epimer is just one of two available anomers. The 4S-epimer is of much lesser importance because the 4R-sugar still finds enough space. The 5S-epimer faces a rather spacious non-polar pocket so that a replacement is not a severe problem. Accordingly, the observed activity values of rare 2-ketoses [12,19,22] are rather well explained by the active center structure. The 2-ketoses are a subgroup of the large

family of `rare sugars' that have been found in a number of organisms [23≠25]. Recently, the interest in rare sugar production increased appreciably because they are useful ingredients of various bioactive compounds [11,12,23≠25].
