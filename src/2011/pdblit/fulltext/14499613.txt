Many cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions depend upon the engagement of specific ligands by members of the integrin family of cell-adhesion receptors. In concert with the identification of new integrins, the number of integrin ligands continues to expand dramatically. The diversity of the integrin ligands bridges many areas of cell and molecular biology. Ligand recognition by integrins requires not only the presence of the cognate primary sequence within an appropriate secondary structure, but also the correct tertiary and quaternary structure of the ligand. Presentation of an `activated' ligand sequence to specific contact sites within the integrin under specified divalent-cation conditions is necessary for a productive and high-affinity interaction. Current Opinion in Cell Biology 1994, 6:656-662

Introduction It has been approximately two decades since the first members of the integrin family were identified as individual cell-surface molecules. Determination of the structural relationships between members of what we now define as integrin subfamilies (PI, 82, 83, etc.) was the result of numerous independent studies during the 1980s. As the primary sequences of various a- and psubunits were established through molecular cloning and DNA sequencing, the inter-relationships among integrin subfamilies became apparent, culminating in the recognition of the integrin family of cell-adhesion receptors. In 1987, the number of integrin a/p heterodimers stood at 10. Within the next five years, the number of distinct integrins had more than doubled. New a- and b-subunits were identified, and new combinations of previously known subunits were defined. In the past two years, only three new CB and one new p have been found. Thus, although the discovery of new integrins can still be anticipated, the rate of identification of new integrin subunits appears to have steadied. In contrast, the identification of integrin ligands remains at a seemingly exponential pace. Integrin ligands now include bacterial and viral proteins, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, complement proteins and cellular counter-receptors, in addition to epithelial and vascular matrix components. The listing of integrin ligands in Table 1 serves to link such diverse fields as hematology, neurobiology, thrombosis, cancer biology, inflammation, AIDS and developmental biology, to name but a few. Thus, identification of novel and diverse integrin ligands has opened new areas of research and has established unexpected interfaces between disciplines.

Despite the diversification of integrin ligands, we continue to gain greater understanding of the structural basis for ligand recognition by integrins. The structure of functional RGD ligand mot& (single-letter code for amino acids) has been defined by NMR and crystallographic approaches. These structural solutions provide precise insights, not only into the fine architecture of this integrin-ligand recognition sequence but also into the nature of the ligand contact sites within the integrins. At the same time, we continue to gain an appreciation of the importance of local secondary structure and of the global protein fold in regulating the functional state of integrin ligands. An additional consequence of the expanding number of integrin ligands is that our perception of the basic characteristics of integrin-ligand interactions is changing. For example, while the dependency on divalent cations of integrin-ligand interactions was viewed as a prototypical characteristic, this concept must be altered in view of newly identified cation-independent ligands. This article focuses on recent and selected advances relating to integrin ligands. On the basis of publications within the last year, two general aspects of this area have been chosen for emphasis: the further diversification of integrin ligands, and the structural basis for ligand recognition by integrins. Ligand diversification

The term `integrins' was originally coined to reflect the role of these receptors in integrating the intracellular cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix [ 11. Such integration remains a predominant recognized function

The disintegrin family of short ligands for integrins continues to expand [5*]. Originally discovered in snake venoms as potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation mediated by GPIIb-IIIa (alIbp3), cellular disintegrins have since been identified. The domain structure of a typical cellular disintegrin, starting at its amino terminus, is as follows: a signal sequence, a pro-domain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region containing a fusion peptide, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Some members of the family are truncated before either the cysteine-rich domain or the EGF repeat, and, consequently, lack a transmembrane domain. Disintegrins with a transmembrane domain are likely to play a role in cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell fusion by serving as immobilized integrin ligands at the cell surface. Analogous to the role of disintegrins in snakes, the soluble disintegrins may act as competitive inhibitors of ligand- integrin interactions.

of integrins, and extracellular matrix proteins constitute the major category of integrin ligands. Two extracellular matrix proteins that have received further attention as integrin ligands in the past year are cytotactin/tenascin and epiligrin [2,3].
Extracellular matrix proteins

Cytotactin/tenascin is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein composed of multiple distinct domains, including 6-l 5 homologous repeats of the fibronectin type III module. The third type III repeat in cytotactin contains an RGD sequence and supports cell attachment and spreading mediated by a, integrin [2]. Epiligrin is an epithelial basement membrane component synthesized by basal keratinocytes [3]. T lymphocyte and keratinocyte adhesion to the epithelial basement membrane can be mediated by the interaction of epiligrin with a& [3]. These findings implicate this ligand-integrin interaction in the preservation of skin integrity and the activity of T lymphocytes in certain pathological cutaneous disorders. a&, which contains the most recently identified asubunit (39% sequence identity with a$, has also been detected in basal keratinocytes of the skin, as well as in the basal epithelium of airways and cornea [4]. Thus, the idea that integrins are involved in epithelial function and integrity continues to develop.

The number of pathogens which interact with integrins also continues to expand. The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 contains an RGD sequence and can mediate cell adhesion. Recently, Tat has been shown to function as a growth factor for both AIDS Kaposi sarcoma (KS) cells and cytokine-induced KS cells and also to support adhesion of these same cells through a specific interaction with the integrin receptors a& and a,& [6*]. Although the pathogenic significance of this interaction remains uncertain, the link between the virus and integrins continues to be intriguing and potentially important. Other viruses recently implicated in interacting with integrins are the RGD-containing foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (7.1, adenovirus 2 [8] and echovirus 1 [9]. The interaction of the adenovirus with a& appears to be critical to the entry of the virus into the cell. The a&-echovirus 1 interaction is independent of both a$, activation state and divalent cations, thereby contrasting with collagen and laminin interactions with a& [9]. Another disease which has recently been directly linked to integrins is Lyme disease [lo]. The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia brr!ydo@i, binds to platelets through aI& in an interaction inhibited by RGD and fibrinogen y chain peptides. Interaction of B. thqdorjki with platelets may be very important for the spread of Lyme disease to numerous tissues. Structural

Great strides have been made in defining the conformation of the tripeptide sequence RGD, which is a consensus binding sequence within numerous integrin ligands. Recent 1H NMR studies have determined that the RGD-containing peptide YGRGDSP can assume secondary structure (a type II B-turn) in aqueous solution at both neutral and acidic pH [ll]. In contrast,

the sequence YGRGESP, which contains a conservative D to E substitution and does not interact with integrins, assumes a type I or type III p-turn conformation. These data suggest that secondary structure controls the biological activity of the integrin peptide ligands. Extrapolating these results to the native protein, one could argue that even if an RGD sequence is exposed and accessible on the ligand surface, its ability to serve as a ligand integrin will still be regulated by its secondary structure. In direct support of the importance of secondary structural considerations, the crystal structures of two unrelated RGD-containing binding domains have been published, bringing our understanding of RGD function to a new level of delineation and sophistication. The crystal structure of the 10th Type III domain of fibronectin (FNIIIlu) has been determined at 1.8 A [12"]. FNIIIlo consists of two layers of B-sheets. one with three antiparallel strands and the other with four antiparallel strands. The p-sheets enclose a hydrophobic core formed by the side chains of 24 amino acids, and are linked by a flexible loop which contains the RGD sequence. The orientation of arginine 78. the first residue in the RGD sequence, was determined; however, due to loop flexibility, the orientation of the D side chain could not be assigned. The presence of a functional RGD sequence in flexible loop also occurs in echistatin [13] and in FMDV [7'], as shown by the second crystal structure reported this past year of a protein containing RGD. In native FMDV [7*], the flexible RGD-containing loop again made the assignment of side-chain orientation impossible. However, the RGD-containing loop was located between two B-strands of capsid protein VP1 and loopdisorder or flexibility was enhanced by a disulflde bond linking the base of the loop in VP1 to VP2. Thus, following reduction of this disulfide bond at the base of the loop, the structure of the loop became sufficiently ordered to allow the assignment of RGD side-chain orientation [7*]. The acidic and basic side chains of the RGD tripeptide were found to be in an open conformation, with their side chains pointing away from each other. This open conformation was previously found for the RGD binding domain in FNIII I?om tenascin [12**]. More recently, the solution structure of decorsin, a potent 3%residue antagonist of atI&, was determined by NMR [14**]. The backbone conformation of the RGD loop was well defined and was atypical, being in a distorted type II turn with Gly at position 2. As in FMDV, the conformation of the acidic and basic side chains of the RGD tripeptide pointed out in almost opposite directions [14**]. In both the FNIIIru and FMDV reports, the general conclusion reached was that these RGD sequences are highly exposed and do not adopt a single static position. This also appears to be the case with the RGD loop in decorsin, in that the loop is accessible and the side chain of Arg is conformationally unrestricted. These data lead to a general model for RGD loops, illustrated in Fig. 1. The RGD loop extends outwards from the protein core with the RGD sequence at its apex in a reverse turn conformation, making it highly accessible. The side chains of Arg and Asp point away

from each other in almost opposite directions. The loop and side chains of Arg and Asp are flexible enough to adopt the proper conformation for high affinity binding to integrins. Contact of the RGD loop with an integrin should fix its conformation and could be the first step in more global conformational changes in the ligand.

All the atoms in the RCD sequence are highlighted using the ball and stick method, whereas only the heavy atoms in the backbone of the remaining amino acids in the loop are displayed. The van der Waals surface of the RGD epitope is also highlighted with dots, emphasizing the importance of the side chains for binding. As shown here, the RCD loop extends out from the protein core, with the RGD sequence itself at the apex. The arginine and aspartic acid side chains in the RGD sequence do not interact, but point away from each other in almost opposite directions. Interaction of the RGD loop with an integrin would most likely be from the bottom center.

With this conclusion, the influence of secondary conformational constraints imposed by amino acids adjacent to the integrin-binding sequence becomes critical for ligand recognition. An excellent example of such regulation is provided by the triple-helix region of collagen Type VI [15]. This triple-helical region of the collagen al(VI), a2(VI) and ct3(VI) chains contains 13 RGD peptide sequences. Nine synthetic peptides encompassing 10 of the 13 RGD sequences were tested for their ability to inhibit cell binding. The principal integrins involved in binding native triple-helix collagen VI were aI& and a$,, whereas a& was the major integrin that bound to denatured collagen VI. Binding of cells to triple-helical collagen VI, with one exception, was sensitive neither to any of the collagen VI peptides nor to the linear or cyclic GRGDS peptides [15]. In contrast, the adhesion of various cell types to

unfolded or denatured collagen VI was inhibited by both GRGDS peptides. These results emphasize the importance of secondary structure in determining ligand affinity and recognition by integrins.
@and activation

Consider the situation in which a competent, unoccupied integrin comes in close proximity to a ligand, such as the RGD binding motif, presented in any one of its possible secondary structure conformations. In order for a productive interaction to occur, two major requirements must first be met (Fig. 2). First, the RGD sequence must be able to adopt the correct conformation in order for it to dock into the integrin's ligand-recognition domain or pocket (Fig. 2a). Second, the RGD sequence must be accessible to the integrin and not buried by the tertiary or quaternary structure of the ligand, i.e. it must not be cryptic (Fig. 2b). If either one of these two requirements is not met, then a stable ligand-integrin interaction will not occur (Fig. 2b.c). Thus, another control is imposed on the ligand by its tertiary and/or quaternary organization.

fibrinogen with aII& via other sites in the molecule, or its deposition on a surface, `activates' this sequence in fibrinogen by altering its tertiaryiquaternary structure such that the RGD sequence can now participate in adhesive interactions [16]. Moreover, it is well established that soluble fibronectin is a poor ligand for a&, but its proteolytic fragments or its deposition into a matrix enhances affinity. These transformations of fibronectin may represent another example of ligand activation. A good example for activation of a non-RGD integrin ligand is found in the multifunctional extracellular protein laminin. Two papers investigating the binding of alp, and a& binding to laminin demonstrate that the structural integrity of the Bl-A-B2 mid-portion (T8') of the laminin elastase E8 fragment is required for integrinmediated adhesion [17,18]. Modification of this region can lead to the exposure of a cryptic non-p, integrin cell-adhesion site and the destruction of a bt adhesion site, and/or complete loss of cell adhesion. Cell adhesion through either pt integrin (a& or a&) also required maintenance of the triple-helical structure of the E8 domain. Still yet another interesting variation on the theme of ligand activation can be found in a recent study of the peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of echistatin, a member of the disintegrin family [19*], This peptide enhanced alI& binding to vitronectin and fibronectin, and stimulated fibrinogen binding to c%II$3. In addition, the echistatin peptide also stimulated atIb~3 binding to collagens I and IV, two ligands not normally associated with a)[&. Thus, this study provides an example of a ligand activating an integrin to expand its recognition repertoire to new ligands. Two groups have recently shown that sequences other than the RGD in FNIIIlu are recognized by aIlI& [20°,21e]. Thus, despite the facts that fibronectin contains an RGD sequence, that RGD peptides inhibit fibronectin binding to this integrin, and that aII& binds to RGD, it is uncertain what sequences in intact fibronectin are responsible for binding. This dilemma recapitulates one that has existed for some time with regard to fibrinogen binding to alI&. Both RGDcontaining peptides horn the Aa chain and non-RGD peptides from the y-chain inhibit fibrinogen binding to its receptor and interact directly with am& How are such questions to be resolved? Mutational analysis provides a direct approach to dissect the relative contribution of l&and-recognition sequences. Two such studies have been performed in the past year with vitronectin and fibrinogen [22**,23**]. It is a major vascular celladhesive protein that is present in plasma and is readily deposited into the extracellular matrix. Vitronectin is a ligand for at least 3 integrins and contains the RGD motif. Site-directed mutagenesis of the RGD sequence to either RGE or RAD resulted in complete loss of cell adhesion activity, confirming that, in vitronectin, the RGD sequence is essential and central to vitronectinmediated cell adhesion [22**]. In contrast, a D to E mutation in either of the RGD sequences, located at Aa 95-97 and Aa 572-574 in fibrinogen, had no effect on the binding of fibrinogen to alI& on activated platelets

states of integrin ligands. In these models, three contact sites in the integrin's ligand-recognition domain (LRD) engage three counter-sites in the integrin-binding domain BBD) of the ligand, in order for a productive (binding of high affinity) interaction to occur. (a) Both the integrin and the ligand are in the correct conformation for high-affinity binding. (b) The IBD of the ligand is cryptic and, thus, no binding can take place. (c) Even though the IBD is exposed, it cannot assume the correct secondary conformation for high-affinity binding and, therefore, can interact with the integrin with only low affinity and specificity.

Although activation of the integrin receptor to develop competency is well recognized, a concept of ligand competency or `l&and activation states' is emerging. An example of ligand activation has developed from the studies of fibrinogen binding to all&. Although fibrinogen contains an RGD sequence at position 95-97 of its Aa chain, this sequence is not exposed in the soluble molecule as defined with antibody probes. Interaction of

or on the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen-coated surfaces [23**]. Furthermore, replacement of the carboxyl terminus of the y-chain, which contains the y-chain recognition sequence, resulted in a major reduction in its capacity to support platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion to fibrinogen-coated surfaces. These results clearly demonstrate the importance of the y-chain sequence for fibrinogen recognition. However, as noted above, the situation may be still more complex, as binding of fibrinogen to all& through its y-chain appears to alter exposure of its RGD motif& allowing for secondary interactions. Nevertheless, mutational analyses appear to be the most incisive approach available to identify recognition sequences within ligands.

specificity and subunit association, raises the possibility that this regulatory domain within p1 is the contact site by which a subunits exert their effects on ligand specificity Interestingly, a region within 83 that is homologous to b, residues 207-218 was also confirmed to be a tLnctiona1 `hot spot' [29**]. Peptides derived from 83 residues 211-221 inhibit a&3 binding activity and fibrinogen binding to platelets, an al&-mediated event. Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 3, this region appears to a be functionally important domain in p-subunits, playing a pivotal role in regulating integrin competency, perhaps by controlling the conformation of adjacent ligand-contact sites in the B-subunits. The integrin receptor a& binds two different ligands, fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule1 (VCAM-1). Using the CSl peptide (the dominantactive site of the HepII/IIICS recognition domain in fibronectin) and recombinant VCAM-1, the fibronectin and VCAM-1 recognition epitopes within a& were mapped either to the identical site or to spatially overlapping sites, as the binding of one ligand precluded binding of the other [30]. In partial agreement with these a& data, mutation of the putative integrin cation-binding sites in a4 resulted in greatly diminished cation-binding, and markedly decreased CS 1/fibronectin and VCAM1 binding [31]. Interestingly, VCAM-1 binding could be restored by treatment with the stimulatory anti-b, monoclonal antibody TS2/16, whereas CSl/fibronectin binding could not. In contrast to both of these ligands, adhesion of the bacterial protein invasin was minimally affected by any RGD mutation. Thus, one can define three ligand-recognition sites in a&. a fibronectin and a VCAM-1 binding site, which are overlapping and dependent on divalent cations, and the third, an invasinbinding site, which is cation-independent. As an LDV sequence is believed to be the active site of CSl, it is possible that, analogous to the RGD sequence in generating antithrombotic agents, LDV may be useful for generating anti-inflammatory agents.

The three 82 integrins, aLp2 (LFA-1, CDlla/CD18), aMp2 (Mac-l, CDllbKD18) and a& (p150,95, CDllc/CD18), and two fl1 integrins, aIf and a$,, contain `inserted' (I) domains. The I domains are sequences of about 190 amino acids that appear to replace the first of the four cation-binding sequences in the asubunits of non-1 domain integrins. The function of the I domain was unknown until recently. Three independent studies published in the past year have implicated the I domain in lig.and- and cation-binding functions of integrins. The I domain of aL was shown to be involved in intracellular adhesion molecule-l (ICAM-1) recognition [24**]; the I domain of aM was implicated in iC3b binding [25**,26..]; and the I domain of a2 was critical for both collagen and echovirus 1 binding [260*]. Divalent cations were also shown to bind to the I domain of (TM. The latter observation not only establishes a previously unrecognized cation-binding motif but also extends the intimate inter-relationship between cationand ligand-contact sites in integrins. Moreover, in the case of a&, monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the binding of several ligands to this integrin react with the I domain, suggesting that multiple overlapping but not identical l&and-contact sites map to this discrete region.
Non-l domain ligand-contact sites

Role of cations
It is well established that divalent cations are crucial to integrin structural stability and that cations can alter the specificity and affinity of integrins for their ligands. Several recent publications have stressed these conclusions [9,31-331. In investigating the defect responsible for Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (defective expression of all&) in a patient, Poncz et al. [33] mapped a single point mutation to position 273 of allb, a G to D substitution. This mutation resides adjacent to the first calcium-binding domain, and prevents aI& from being cleaved into its heavy and light chain and the receptor from being expressed on the cell surface. This study underscores the importance of the calcium-binding domains in maintaining the overall structure and function of integrins. The study of Smith et al. [32] further emphasizes the importance of cations in regulating ligand binding and specificity. The a& integrin

Members of the B1 subfamily recognize multiple ligands and mediate both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Using interspecies chimeric B1 constructs, a small region within PI, residues 207-218, which is highly conserved among nearly all known b-subunits and is located between two putative ligand-contact sites (residues 120-182 and 220-231), has been identified as a critical sequence for the binding of both receptor activating and inhibiting antibodies [27**,28"]. An additional sequence within 83, located in the cysteine rich repeats near the transmembrane domain, was also identified as a regulatory domain [28**]. A set of antibodies that altered either ligand binding, ligand specificity or induced a@ subunit dissociation, were mapped to this region. The observation that these antibodies altered both ligand

independent integrin ligands. Binding of these cationindependent ligands appears to involve contact sites distinct from those involved in binding cation-dependent ligands. Conclusions The discovery of novel and diverse integrin ligands has opened new areas of research and has established unexpected interfaces between disciplines. Despite this diversification, we have gained some insight into the structural basis of ligand recognition by integrins. It is clearly evident that the conformation of both the receptor and its ligand is central in integrin-ligand interactions. Crystal structure and NMR solution data of various native RGD sequences have provided us with insights into the structural requirements for this interaction. These have led to a greater appreciation of the importance of local secondary structure and the global protein fold in regulating the functional state of integrin ligands. Still missing are structural data on the integrin recognition domains that have now been defined. Crystallization of even one of the integrin recognition domains with and without its ligand would immeasurably increase our understanding of this interaction and provide us with a basis for developing a general structural model of integrin-ligand interactions. This model would provide us with new insights into the development of the next generation of therapeutic agents, which have the potential to be vastly more effective and specific than those in current use.
