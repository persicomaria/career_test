The structures of human carbonic-anhydrase-I1 complexes with the anionic inhibitors hydrogen sulphide (HS -) and nitrate (NO,) have been determined by X-ray diffraction at 0.19-nm resolution from crystals soaked at pH 7.8 and 6.0, respectively. The modes of binding of these two anions differ markedly from each other. The strong inhibitor HS - replaces the native zinc-bound waterihydroxide (Wat263) leaving the tetrahedral metal geometry unaltered and acts as a hydrogen-bonding donor towards Thrl99y. The weak NO; inhibitor does not displace Wat263 from the metal coordination but occupies a fifth binding site changing the zinc coordination polyhedron into a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramid. The interaction of NO; with the metal is weak; the nearest of its oxygen atoms being at a distance of 0.28 nm from the zinc ion. The binding of nitrate to the enzyme is completed by a hydrogen bond to the metal coordinated Wat263 and a second one to a water molecule of the active-site cavity. The structures of the two complexes help to rationalize the binding of anionic inhibitors to carbonic anhydrase and the binding mode displayed by NO; may be relevant to the catalytic mechanism. Erythrocyte carbonic-anhydrase enzymes (CA) are zinc enzymes which catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of bicarbonate at very high turnover rates [l]. Among the known isoenzymes, the human carbonic-anhydrase I1 (HCA 11) is characterized by the highest catalytic activity [l] (k,,, of 1 x lo6 S The crystal structure K) I. of HCA I1 [2-41 shows that the catalytic zinc ion is bound in a tetrahedral coordination geometry to three histidines and a waterihydroxy ion. Inorganic monovalent anions are at various strengths inhibitors of CA [ 5 ] . Due to the weakness of the binding of the natural substrateiproduct bicarbonate, the study of anion binding to the enzyme has been valuable in probing the enzymic reaction mechanism [l]. Kinetic measurements have proved that the anions have different modes of CA inhibition depending on the substrate and on the pH. In fact, anion inhibition is non-competitive below pH 7 and uncompetitive at pH 9 towards COz hydration whereas it is competitive towards HCO; dehydration at low and neutral pH [6, 71. Spectroscopic studies have shown that anions bind to cobalt-substituted CA at the metal site either by replacing the metal-bound water molecule or by expanding the coordination number [8 - 101. In some cases an equilibrium between the tetra-coordinated and penta-coordinated metal may exist [lo]. Following structural evidence, the difference in coordination geometry shown by anionic species in coordinating the zinc ion has been attributed to the ability of the inhibitor to act as a hydrogen-bonding donor towards the active-site residue Thrl99 so it is able to replace the zinc-bound water

molecule [ l l - 121. Hence only protonated inhibitors satisfying the steric requirements can maintain tetrahedral coordination, whereas unprotonated ligands can either bind the zinc as an extra ligand reaching penta-coordination, or bind the protein in a nearby non-metal site. In this respect, recent crystallographic investigations on binding of CN- and CNO- to HCA I1 have found these anions bound to a site in the vicinity of the zinc ion, but not directly coordinated to the metal [ 131. This observation differs from what has been found in solution by a multinuclear NMR investigation [14]. The results of the latter study confirm the early finding of direct binding of CN- and CNO- to the metal in cobalt-substituted bovine CA I1 [5, 151. In order to contribute to the understanding of this behaviour and to probe further the CA chemistry, we have determined the crystal structures of the adducts of HCA I1 with the anionic inhibitors HS- and NO;.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crystals of HCA I1 have been prepared following published procedures [2]. The crystals were transferred from the crystallization medium to a 3 M (NH4)2S04 solution, buffered at pH 7.8 using 50 mM Tris, containing 1 mM HSobtained by the hydrolysis of an equimolar Na2S solution (the hydrolysis of Na2S at pH 7.8 can be considered quantitative) or to a 3 M (NH4)2S04solution, buffered at pH 6 with 80 mM sodium citrate containing 0.6 M K N 0 3 . The rapid transfer from the alkaline crystallization solution to the acidic soaking solution did not affect the crystal quality. The different inhibitor concentrations used are due to the different affinities of the two anions for the enzyme. The HCA-I1 crystals were soaked in the hydrogen sulphide solution for 12 h whereas the

868
soaking of the nitrate solution was protracted for one week before data collection. Diffraction data on crystals of both adducts were collected with a Siemens (Xentronics) multiwire area detector with graphite monochromatized CUKEX-ray radiation from a Rigaku RU200BEH rotating anode. The data reduction was performed with the Xengen [16] package. All calculations were done either on 3100 or 3200 VAX stations. The program packages CCP4 [17] or PROTEIN [18] were used to calculate I2Fo I - I Fc I and I Fo I -1 Fcl Fourier difference maps. The program FRODO [19] was used for model building and inspection of the Fourier maps at various stages of the work. The restrained least-squares refinement [20] of both structures was performed using the programs PROLSQ [21] for the HS- complex, and TNT [22] for the NO, refining atomic positions and isotropic temperature factors. A 0,154-nm resolution structure of HCA 11 [27] was used for initial phase calculations after removal of four active-site water molecules. Table 1 reports details of the data collection and refinement. From the first Fourier difference maps the presence of hydrogen sulphide and nitrate anions in the activesite cavity was evident but they were introduced into the model only after a few cycles of refinement. These difference maps also showed that the bulk of the CA molecule was not affected by the binding of the inhibitors. After some cycles of refinement of the nitrate complex a hemispherical protrusion appeared on one side of the electron density corresponding to NO; and this was interpreted as due to residual occupancy of the native deep water Wat338 (the nomenclature used follows that of reference [4]) which is replaced by the NO; in the complex. Consequently the occupancy of the nitrate and of Wat338 was refined and resulted in a partial occupancy of 0.7 and 0.3 respectively. These values were kept fixed in the final cycles of refinement. The highest peaks in the final Fourier difference maps calculated with coefficients and phases from the refined model were below 3.0 0. The root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of the final atomic positions estimated from a Luzzati plot [23] for both structures is 0.015 nm. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of the HCA-II/HS- and HCA-II/NO, complexes have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, Chemistry Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973, USA, from which copies are available under accession numbers 1 CAO [24].

Fig. 1 shows the omit map of the HCA II/HS- complex obtained from the refined coordinates from which the contribution of the inhibitor has been omitted. The electron density clearly shows the hydrogen sulphide ion coordinated to zinc at a distance of 0.22 nm, replacing the waterlhydroxide (Wat263) of the native enzyme. Its interaction with the enzyme is completed by a hydrogen bond donated to Oy of Thr199. Table 2 reports the coordination geometry of the zinc ion compared with that of the native enzyme. The zinc ion maintains its tetrahedral coordination geometry and differences from the native structure are minimal; the Zn-S distance is slightly increased due to the larger covalent radius of sulphur with respect to oxygen. The water-molecule network in the active-site cavity is little affected by the inhibitor binding. The native and the HS --complexed HCA-I1 structures are

Fig. 2 reports a Fourier difference map showing the enzyme active site obtained from the refined coordinates from which the contribution of the nitrate ion and Wat263 was subtracted. The major feature present in the map has the planar triangular shape of the nitrate anion and is located in the deep-water pocket of the enzyme. This pocket is delimited by residues Va1121, Leul41, Va1143, Leu198, Thr199, Val207 and Trp209, and in the native enzyme it is occupied by Wat338 hydrogen bonded to the amide nitrogen of Thr199 and to the zinc-bound Wat263. Upon binding, the nitrate has displaced Wat338 and has caused Wat263 to move from its original position by 0.05 nm (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The nitrate anion has only a weak interaction with zinc as indicated by the 0.28nm distance, nevertheless the zinc coordination polyhedron has clearly changed becoming a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramid (Table 2) with the nitrate at one apex, His96 at the other and His94, Hisl 19 and Wat263 in the basal plane. The least-squares deviations from the mean plane of Nt;2 His94,

870
N61 Hisll9, Wat263 and Zn2+ are 0.010, 0.009, 0.010 and 0.030 nm, respectively. The interactions of the nitrate with the cavity are completed by a hydrogen bond to Wat263. It must also be noted that the nitrate oxygen in the apical position is at the same distance from both the zinc ion and Wat263. This finding is analogous to what has been observed in the HCA-11/ SCN- structure in which the zinc-coordinated SCN- nitrogen makes a short contact (0.24 nm) with Wat263 [ll]. Finally it must be noticed that the nitrate 0 2 is only 0.34 nm from the amide nitrogen of Thr199.

The observed Zn-S distance of 0.22 nm is, within experimental error, the same as the Zn-0 Wat263 distance of 0.21 nm found in the native enzyme and is also consistent with the distance found for covalently bound sulphur in small-molecule complexes [Zn-S = 0.22 -0.23 nm; Zn-0 (Wat) = 0.20-0.211 [25]. This means that the nonprotein-ligand position in the CA zinc site has enough room to accommodate ligand atoms with different covalent radii, such as sulphur and oxygen. Due to the close similarity between HS- and OH-, the former is able to replace the latter also in the hydrogen-bonding pattern in which the hydroxy ion is involved in the native HCA I1 (Fig. 2). The behaviour of hydrogen sulphide observed in this structure is consistent with the proposal [ l l , 121 that only protonated exogenous ligands can maintain the tetrahedral zinc geometry replacing the water/hydroxy ion. Moreover, and just like OH- and many aromatic sulfonamides, it has a negative charge on the proton-bearing atom. Ions of this kind are very strong ligands, compared to ions where the negative charge and the proton belong to different atoms, like bicarbonate and bisulfite. The above proposal has also been supported by the recent structural determinations of CN - and CNO - adducts with HCA 11, which have been found bound near the metal, but not directly coordinated to it (distances to zinc 0.32 - 0.33 nm) 1131. The binding of the nitrate ion to the enzyme follows the above rule. In fact the anion does not replace Wat263 but occupies a fifth coordination site. The long distance is indicative of a weak interaction between the nitrate oxygen and zinc (Table 2), nevertheless the metal center is heavily influenced by the anion binding, as indicated by the rearrangement of the geometry around the zinc. The shift from the native tetrahedron to an almost regular trigonal bipyramid is attained mainly with the movement of Wat263 which lies in the same plane as His96, His119 and Zn (Fig. 3). The reasons for the weak binding of the nitrate anion can be ascribed to its poor Lewis-base properties, and consequently its interaction with the zinc ion has a prevalent electrostatic character. The hydrogen-bonding network in which the nitrate ion is involved needs detailed description. Table 3 and Fig. 2 report the relevant hydrogen-bond interactions occurring in the enzyme active site. Among the residues present in the active-site cavity of CA, Glu106 plays a crucial role in determining the hydrogen bonding pattern in which the zinc ligand replacing the native Wat263 is involved and hence in determining the mode of binding of anions to the enzyme [4, 11, 121. Freeenergy-perturbation calculations [26] have estimated for this group a pKa in the range 2-4. With this assumption and under our experimental conditions (pH 6.0), Glu106 should

Scheme 1. Possible mechanism of CO hydrolysis. In step 1 the bicarbonate molecule is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the zinc-bound OH group on C 0 2 . Step 2 shows the formation of a penta-coordinate intermediate after the binding to zinc of a water molecule. This step is mimicked by the HCA II/nitrate complex. In step 3 the bicarbonate molecule is released and the tetrahedral geometry is restored. Step 4 represents the final proton-transfer event reforming the nucleophile

be deprotonated and hence should receive a hydrogen bond from Thr199 which in turn is receiving another hydrogen bond from Wat263. However, in this complex we observe a short distance (0.28 nm) between the nitrate 0 2 atom and Wat263, this together with a good geometry (Zn-Wat263-02 angle 118.8") is indicative of the presence of a hydrogen bond. This interaction shows that the ligand in the Wat263 position is able to act as hydrogen-bonding donor towards both Thr199 and the nitrate; hence it must be a water molecule and not a hydroxy ion. This is also true for other HCA-I1 complexes with non-protonated anions like SCN- [ l l ] and formate. The above finding is consistent with the pKa of 7 assigned to Wat263 [l] and also shows that in the crystalline state, the enzyme is subjected to an acid/base equilibrium depending on the pH of the soaking solution. Comparison of the HCA II/NO; complex with the binding of the natural substrate HCO; to the Thr199 + His HCAI1 mutant [ 121 shows important differences. The bicarbonate ion acts as a bidentate ligand towards zinc and the geometry of the resulting complex is a more distorted trigonal bipyramid. It has been suggested that the structure of the bicarbonate complex may represent the binding mode for HCO; after the catalytic conversion of C 0 2 to HCO;, but a tetrahedral coordination of the bicarbonate during the catalytic event has also been suggested. The present nitrate complex may instead represent the proposed penta-coordinated [lo] reaction intermediate subsequent to the hydration step, before the detachment of the bicarbonate anion and the final proton transfer in the C 0 2 hydration reaction as depicted in Scheme 1.
