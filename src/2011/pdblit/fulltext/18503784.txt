Abstract Binding of the Cdc25c-T48 ligand to PinA from Aspergillus nidulans has been characterised by the identification of 15N and 1H resonances from 1H­15N HSQC NMR titration experiments using previous backbone assignments. It is shown that the binding site for the Cdc25c-T48 ligand with PinA is the same as in the mammalian protein Pin1, although with a reduced binding affinity. It had previously been proposed that the arginine residue (R17) in the loop I region of the Pin1 WW domain is essential for binding to the pSer/pThr-Pro motifs of phosphorylated ligands such as Cdc25c. In PinA, a fungal homologue of Pin1, the arginine residue (R17) is replaced with an asparagine residue (N17). The effect of substitution of R17 by N17 in Pin1 has been investigated via a computational study, which predicted that changing R17 to N17 in Pin1 lowers the ligand binding affinity as a result of reduced hydrogen bonding between the protein and the phosphate group of the ligand. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The WW domain is a well-known protein module that mediates protein to protein interactions by interacting with prolinecontaining ligands [1] through the XP groove on the surface [2]. WW domains generally consist of an anti-parallel triple stranded -sheet [1] and are classified as one of three distinct motifs, (a) Group-I, (b) Groups-II/III, and (c) Group-IV, based on their binding specificities to the proline-containing sequences [1,14]. Aspergillus nidulans (A. nidulans) is an ideal experimental organism to study gene regulation and eukaryotic cell biology [3]. PinA of A. nidulans is a homologue of the mammalian protein Pin1 with both having WW domains classified as Group-IV [4] which bind selectively to the pS/pT-P motif (where "pS/pT" represents phosphorylated serine/threonine). A comparison of the sequence and organisation of the domains in Pin1 and PinA is shown in Fig. 1.

Significantly, both the WW and petidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) domains of PinA are similar to those of the mammalian Pin1 [5,6]. The WW domain is important for substrate targeting (pS/pT-P motif) while the PPIase domain is critical to induce conformational changes of the substrate by catalysing the cis/trans isomerisation of peptidyl-prolyl imide bonds [7]. Pin1 binds to the substrates such as the mitotic regulators (NIMA and Cdc25c), RNA polymerase II and p53 [8,9]. PinA has also been shown to regulate NIMA function in A. nidulans [5]. They both perform critical roles in diverse cellular functions, including the progression of cells into mitosis [5,10]. The crystal structure of Pin1 [11] with a bound ligand indicates that the phosphate group in the pS/pT-P ligand binds to the residues in the p patch [4], which is located on Loop I connecting the first and second -strands of the Pin1 WW domain [11]. The p patch of the Pin1 WW domain contains an important arginine residue (R17) that forms hydrogen bonds to the phosphate group of the phosphorylated serine or threonine in a pS/pT-P ligand. This interaction results in a change in conformation near the p patch during binding. Zarrinpar and Lim [2] predicted that the R17 residue in the Loop I region of

the Group-IV WW domain is essential for binding to the pS/pTP motifs of phosphorylated ligands such as Cdc25c (and thus control the cell cycle). We have previously reported that the Cdc25c-T48 ligand (a small eight amino acid peptide, with T48 phosphorylated) binds to both the Pin1 and PinA WW domains [4] despite R17 in Pin1 being replaced by N17 in PinA. In this work, the binding site of the PinA WW domain was investigated by NMR ligand titration experiment and the effect on binding affinity when R17 is replaced by N17 in Pin1 was studied using computational simulation.
2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sample preparation
Detailed information regarding the plasmid construction has previously been reported [4]. Briefly, the 13C15N-labeled GST-fusion PinA WW domain was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and digested to separate the WW domain from GST. The DNAs encoding the PinA WW domain were synthesised and amplified by a modified PCR method in which synthetic oligonucleotides were used as the template. The plasmid was harbored in BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and cultured at 310K using the bubbling culture method [12,13]. The 13C- and 15 N-enriched PinA WW domain was prepared using the 13C- and 15N-enriched C. H.L. medium (Chlorella Industry, Japan). Purification of the GST-PinA WW domain was performed using Glutathione Sepharose (GE Healthcare). After digestion of GST and PinA WW domain by thrombin, reverse-phase chromatography was carried out to separate these proteins under 0.1% trifluoroacetate using a linear gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions that contained the PinA WW domain were lyophilised to remove the volatile components. Proteins were visualised by Coomassie Brilliant Blue after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Estimation of the protein purity was carried out by densitometric analysis, using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The final purity was found to be over 95% (Fig. 2). Mass spectrometry showed that the GST-fused WW domain was successfully digested into GST and the WW domain (Supplementary material). The Cdc25c-T48 (GGVPRpTPV) and unphosphorylated Cdc25c peptides were sythesised using standard solid-state synthesis methods using Fmoc-protected amino acids and purified as described previously [4,14].

The binding curves (Supplementary material) were analysed using a nonlinear regression analysis following the procedure of Lian and Roberts [16], by fitting the chemical shift changes that have been identified in Fig. 3a to Eq. (2) in order to determine the dissociation constant and the limiting shift.  qffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi  Dd ¼ 0:5Ddmax 1 þ X þ KD =½PinA À ð1 þ X þ KD =½PinAÞ2 À 4X ð2Þ

2.3. SPR binding assay
The SPR binding assay was performed as reported as previously [4] using a BIAcore 2000 system (Biacore AB). In the present study, we used Cdc25c-T48 and unphosphorylated Cdc25c peptides as ligands immobilised on the CM5 sensorchip. The temperature and buffer composition used in the SPR assay was the same as that in the NMR measurements.

2.4. Computational mutation study of Pin1 WW domain
The crystal structure [11] of Pin1 with bound ligand (1F8A) was used as the basis of the modelling calculations. The mutant (N17) was generated by converting R17 into N17 and overlapping the side chain heavy atoms using Maestro [17]. The original and mutant Pin1 are identified as wild type (WT) and mutant Pin1, respectively. The ligand from the crystal structure 1F8A [11] was

2.2. Ligand titration experiments and analysis
The NMR ligand titration experiments were carried out with 0.44 mM 13C and 15N enriched PinA WW domain dissolved in a solution of 100 mM NaH2PO4 at pH 6.7 containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% D2O. The peptide concentration was determined from quantitative amino acid analysis using a fluorescamine technique. Tiny aliquots of the highly concentrated Cdc25c-T48 peptide were added to the 13C15N-PinA WW domain solution, and the changes in 15 N and 1H chemical shift were monitored by a series of 1H­15N HSQC spectra at 0.23, 0.46, 0.92, 1.38, 1.84, 2.3, 2.76 mM of Cdc25c-T48 acquired on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Narolac z-axis gradient probe at

The HSQC chart is an overlap of 7 titrations at ligand concentration of 0.23, 0.46, 0.92, 1.38, 1.84, 2.3 and 2.76 mM. (b) The graph shows the total 1H and 15N shifts of the backbone amide by comparing the HSQC spectra at ligand concentrations of 0.0 and 2.76 mM. The sum of the 1H and 15N shifts in hertz (Hz) is presented.

The results show that the signals of E12, H15, S16, N17, S18, N20, L21, Y23, Y24, N26, R33, W34, and E35 are shifted to lower field as seen in Fig. 3a. Since we have derived a 3D NMR structure of the PinA WW domain (PDB ID 2JM7) [19] the shifted signals S16, N17, S18, N20 and L21 are identified to be in the p patch located around Loop I (Fig. 1 light grey boxes), and Y23 and W34 are the residues that form the XP groove [2]. The other shifted signals are close to these sites. As these are the only shifted signals it is evident that there is only one binding site for this ligand in the PinA WW domain. The downfield signal shift on binding (Fig. 3a) is consistent with hydrogen bond formation. The large shifts of the N17 and S18 residues (Fig. 3b) show that both residues contribute to the binding of the phosphate group from the ligand Cdc25c-T48. The interaction between N17 and the ligand is probably through hydrogen bonding as the crystal structure of Pin1 shows hydrogen bonding between R17 in Pin1 and the phosphate group in the ligand [11]. Binding of this ligand has been analysed using an SPR assay where it was shown that the peptide/protein binding occurs in 1:1 stoichiometry, with a predicted dissociation constant of 480 ± 70 M, calculated using the average response unit (RU) under steady-state conditions. Data were fitted globally by Scatchard plot analysis [4]. Measurements of the 15N and 1H chemical shift as a function of ligand concentration enabled KD value of 473 ± 54 M to be derived from Eq. (2) (Supplementary material). It is in good agreement with the SPR data above. More importantly, no binding was observed between the PinA WW domain and the unphosphorylated Cdc25c-T48 ligand using the SPR assay (Fig. 4), where the RU value of the PinA WW domain with the unphosphorylated ligand is zero, compared to 150 RU with the phosphorylated ligand. Thus it is concluded that the PinA WW domain binds to the pS/pT-P ligands in a phosphorylationdependent specific manner. The theoretical Rmax value of 1,300 RU of this binding was calculated from Eq. (3) (Biacore manual), assuming it is 1:1 binding model. Rmax ¼ MrA =MrL Â RI Â N ð3Þ

used, which has the sequence YpSPTpSPS. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed using AMBER 8 [18]. The methodology used in the minimisation and MD simulations was the same as published elsewhere [19]. Briefly, the WT and mutant Pin1 with the bound ligand were solvated in an octahedral box of TIP3P water molecules [20] with a minimum solute wall distance of 10 Å. A 1-ns MD simulation (500 snapshots at 2 ps interval) was carried out after the system had been equilibrated. The binding enthalpy was calculated using single trajectory MD simulations and the standard protocols in the MM/PBSA module within AMBER 8 [18]. Hydrogen bond analysis of the snapshots was performed using the ptraj module within AMBER 8 [18], using the standard distance of 3.5 Å and cutoff angle of 120 degree.

3. Results and discussion Results from the NMR titration experiment are presented in Fig. 3a, in which increasing quantities of the Cdc25c-T48 ligand were added to PinA and monitored by the 1H and 15N backbone amide chemical shifts. Previous assignments [19] of the PinA WW backbone chemical shifts (BMRB accession number 15003) enable an assignment of the perturbed chemical shifts.

where Rmax is the upper limit of analyte binding calculated from the amount of immobilised ligand under saturating binding conditions, MrA and MrL are the molecular weights of the injected protein (PinA WW domain) and the immobilised material (Cdc25c-T48), respectively, RI is the response unit from the active immobilised material, and N is the stoichiometry of the binding. Since the experimental RU 150 RU is considerably smaller than the Rmax, it follows that the binding kinetics is consistent with a 1:1 binding model. Patel et al. [21] have estimated that the reduction of one hydrogen bond results in a 10-fold decrease in binding strength. Previous SPR assays [4] indicated that the difference in binding strength between Pin1 and PinA is approximately 9-fold. This is consistent with reduced hydrogen bonding between the amide protons in N17 and the ligand phosphate group in PinA in comparison with the enhanced hydrogen bonding between the phosphate ligand and the positively charged asparagine residue (R17) of Pin1.

To further evaluate this hypothesis, the effect on the binding energy of R17 being replaced to N17 in Pin1 was investigated with a computational study. The binding energies of the ligand to the WT and mutant Pin1 have been calculated using MM/MD calculations of the ligand/protein complex in a "box" of water using the MM/PBSA protocol within AMBER 8. The computational results presented here predict that the binding affinity of the ligand in this model system is a factor of 14 greater for WT Pin1 (R17) compared to mutant Pin1 (N17). These calculations were based on the X-ray structure of the ligand bound to Pin1 [11] and a structure in which R17 was replaced by N17. The calculated ligand binding enthalpy (H) for WT Pin1 (R17) is - 52.7 kcal mol- 1 compared to - 51.1 kcal mol- 1 for the mutant Pin1 model (N17). The difference of 1.6 kcal mol- 1 equates to a factor of 14 difference in dissociation constants. This result is reasonably consistent with the factor of 9 difference in ligand binding affinity for Pin1 compared to PinA from SPR assays determined previously [4]. No attempt was made to estimate the entropy change on binding, however we do not expect entropic effects to be significant. The MD snapshots from the calculations allow the contribution of hydrogen bonding between WT (R17) and mutant (N17) in the models of Pin1 and the phosphate group on the ligand to be evaluated. Hydrogen bond analysis reveals that the WT has 90.6% occupancy of hydrogen bonding from the phosphate oxygen to the amine side chain of R17 during the 1-ns MD simulation. This occupancy decreased to 35.4% in the mutant N17, which explains the weaker binding. 4. Conclusions Results from this study confirm the previous hypothesis [4] that the p patch without the charged arginine residue is capable of binding to the Group-IV ligands. SPR assays indicate that the PinA WW domain binds specifically to the Cdc25c-T48 ligand. NMR signal shifts were identified around Loop I and the XP groove using the solution structure of the PinA WW domain

[19], which exhibited a similar shape to the Pin1 WW domain. Thus, the PinA and Pin1 WW domains use the same site for ligand binding, although binding in Pin1 is stronger than in PinA. Computational modelling predicted a difference in binding enthalpy of 1.6 kcal mol- 1, between WT (R17) Pin1 and mutant (N17), with binding to WT Pin 1 favoured. However, the weaker ligand binding in PinA does not appear to affect its efficiency since most of the proteins have multiple pS/pT-P sites that are phosphorylated. Therefore, it is likely that the PinA WW domain has been designed by nature to have a weaker binding than Pin1 (N17 rather than the R17) so that after the isomerisation reaction, it can quickly relocate to the next site to maintain efficient enzyme activity. The finding of PinA (N17) binds to Cdc25c-T48 ligand provides an important modification to the prediction that the arginine residue in Loop I (R17) is essential for the cellular function of the Group-IV WW domains [2]. It is consistent with a previous finding that the Loop I conformation is more important than the presence of R17 [22]. This is further supported by the observation that, despite the weak binding of the PinA WW domain to a single pS/pT-P motif, PinA indeed functions as a regulator of NIMA in A. nidulans and plays an essential role in the survival and mitotic regulation of A. nidulans [5].
