Fibers of pilin monomers (pili) form the dominant adhesin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and they play an important role in infections by this opportunistic bacterial pathogen. Blocking adhesion is therefore a target for vaccine development. The receptor-binding site is located in a C-terminal disulphide-bonded loop of each pilin monomer, but functional binding sites are displayed only at the tip of the pilus. A factor complicating vaccination is that different bacterial strains produce distinct, and sometimes highly divergent, pilin variants. It is surprising that all strains still appear to bind a common receptor, asialo-GM1. Here, we present Ê the 1.63 A crystal structure of pilin from P. aeruginosa strain PAK. The structure shows that the proposed receptor-binding site is formed by two b-turns that create a surface dominated by main-chain atoms. Receptor speci®city could therefore be maintained, whilst allowing side-chain variation, if the main-chain conformation is conserved. The location of the binding site relative to the proposed packing of the pilus ®ber raises new issues and suggests that the current ®ber model may have to be reconsidered. Finally, the structure of the C-terminal disulphide-bonded loop will provide the template for the structure-based design of a consensus sequence vaccine.

Introduction
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that infects immunosuppressed individuals and compromised tissues such as burn wounds (Bang et al., 1998), damaged corneal tissue (Dart & Seal, 1988), and the trachea of intubated patients (Crouch Brewer et al., 1996) or patients with cystic ®brosis (Tummler et al., 1997). Treatment of patients is complicated by an innate resistance to antimicrobial agents (Alonso et al., 1999) and the presence of an alginate capsule (May et al., 1991). As a consequence, P. aeruginosa infections contribute signi®cantly to morbidity and mortality in the groups at risk.
This work is dedicated to Parimi Sastry, who passed away shortly after the PAK pilin structure was determined. E-mail address of the corresponding author: bart.hazes@ualberta.ca

For P. aeruginosa and many other pathogenic organisms the ability to adhere to host tissues is essential to initiate an infection (Beachey, 1981). Adhesins are therefore a common constituent of the repertoire of virulence factors of pathogens. In P. aeruginosa several adhesins have been described; viz. the alginate capsule (Doig et al., 1987), exoenzyme S (Baker et al., 1991), ¯agella (Ramphal et al., 1996), and pili (Doig et al., 1988). For P. aeruginosa, pili have been found to be the dominant adhesins early in the infection process (for a review, see Hahn, 1997). The importance of pili-mediated adherence is further demonstrated by the loss of virulence of engineered P. aeruginosa strains that lack functional pili (Farinha et al., 1994; Tang et al., 1995) and by the protective effect of immunisation with puri®ed pilins (Sheth et al., 1995; Cachia et al., 1998). Although immunisation was successful in animal models, the protection was found to be strain-speci®c. Determination of the amino acid sequences of pilins of several P. aeruginosa strains

1006 has indeed revealed a striking level of sequence divergence (Figure 1). The pili of P. aeruginosa are polymers of noncovalently associated pilin monomers, forming a ®ber that is approximately 6 nm wide and up to several micrometres long. They are polar, retractable, and are considered as prototypes of type IV pili. An assembly model of the type IV pilus has recently been proposed based on the crystal structure of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain MS11 pilin (MS11 pilin) and other experimental data (Parge et al., 1995; Forest & Tainer, 1997). All type IV pili share a highly conserved N-terminal hydrophobic sequence (Figure 1) which is believed to be central to the assembly and integrity of the pilus ®ber. The general features of the proposed ®ber model for MS11 pili would be accordingly expected to be applicable to all type IV pili. Proteins with a very similar N-terminal hydrophobic a-helix also play a

role in the general secretion pathway which is required for assembly of the type IV pilus and the bacterial secretion of numerous enzymes and toxins (Lu et al., 1997). The adhesive properties of type IV pili are located at the tip of the pilus. In P. aeruginosa each monomer (named pilA) has a receptor binding site. However, only the binding sites of monomers at the pilus tip are functional, with the others apparently obscured during ®ber assembly (Lee et al., 1994). In N. gonorrhoeae pili the monomer (pilE) forms a ®ber that can bind red blood cells; however, binding to epithelial cells requires pilC (Scheuerp¯ug et al., 1999), a distinct and possibly tip-located protein (Rudel et al., 1995). The gene for a pilC homologue exists in P. aeruginosa (pilY1) (Alm et al., 1996), but its function is as yet unclear and indeed its presence in the pilus is uncertain.

Figure 1. Multiple sequence alignment of type IV pilins. The observed secondary structural elements, as given by PROCHECK (Laskowski, 1993), for MS11 pilin and PAK pilin are given above and below each sequence block, respectively, using cylinders for a-helices, ®lled arrows for b-strands, and horizontal lines for the C-terminal b-turns. Residue numbers for these two sequences are also provided. Regions that are structurally equivalent in MS11 and PAK pilin are shown in bold and slightly larger font. Positions in these regions, or in the N-terminal hydrophobic helix, that are strictly conserved are printed in reverse video. Positions with moderate conservation are printed on a gray background. For positions 55 to 77 (PAK numbering), strict and moderate conservation is calculated separately for the top four and bottom ®ve sequences, respectively. This re¯ects our belief that these two groups of sequences adopt distinct conformations in this region. Two very short b-strands in the PAK structure are indicated by open arrows, and two ®lled triangles highlight the positions of the two cis-proline residues. The C-terminal disul®debonded loop, which contains the proposed binding site and is the focus of peptide-based vaccine design, is boxed. The listed sequences are from; N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 (gij3212472), N. meningitidis strain FAM18 (gij2228578), and P. aeruginosa strains K122-4 (gij77636), P1 (gij151472), CD (gij120405), PA103 (gij120436), PAO (gij120440), T2A (gij545132), and PAK (gij120438). The alignment was prepared with CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994) with minor manual editing, and the Figure was created with the program ALSCRIPT (Barton, 1993).

1007 tor-binding site. The truncated PAK pilin is highly soluble and yielded excellent crystals. The resolÊ ution of the 1.63 A data set used in this study is actually limited by the detector hardware rather than by the diffracting power of the crystal. A data Ê set to better than 1.0 A resolution has recently been collected at the SBC beamline of the APS synchrotron (Chicago, USA) which should allow us to obtain an atomic resolution model of PAK pilin in the future. At this moment, the only type IV pilin of known Ê structure is the 2.6 A crystal structure of MS11 pilin (Parge et al., 1995; Forest et al., 1999). Residues 29 to 144 of PAK pilin, present in our truncated construct, have only 17.2 % sequence identity with MS11 pilin, and no convincing molecular replacement solution could be found using the AMoRe program (Navaza, 1994). Experimental phases were therefore obtained using the multiple isomorphous replacement technique (see Materials and Methods and Table 1). The quality of the starting phases, combined with the high resolution and completeness of the native data (only the F000 Ê re¯ection is missing out to 1.64 A), allowed wARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1997) to auto-trace 116 out of the 120 residues (97 %) that are visible in the ®nal model. The r.m.s.d. from the ®nal re®ned model Ê was 0.10 A for all main-chain atoms including Cb. The three N-terminal residues, not visible in the ®nal model, and the fourth residue (residue 25) were not modeled at all. The ®fth residue (residue 26) was present in wARP's dummy atom model, but was not auto-traced. Residues Pro89 and Asp90 were accurately modeled by dummy atoms, but were not auto-traced because Pro89 and Pro91 are cis-proline residues (Figure 3 and below). The ®nal re®ned model has R and Rfree values of 15.3 % and 18.1 %, respectively. PROCHECK analysis (Laskowski et al., 1993) shows that 96 % of all residues are in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot, and the remaining 4 % in the additionally allowed regions. The r.m.s.d. of bond Ê lengths and angles are 0.012 A and 1.0  , respectively, and the r.m.s.d. for B-factors of bonded main-chain and side-chain atoms are 2.6 and Ê 4.4 A2, respectively. As may be expected, the electron density is excellent for most of the model as is clear from Figure 3. Only the ®rst three residues, all from the OmpA fusion, could not be built due to lack of electron density. Several residues (Arg30, Lys68, Lys88, Lys110, Lys128, and Glu135), all solvent-exposed, did not show appreciable electron density for part of their side-chains and the atoms without clear experimental density have not been included in the model. Residues Glu49, Gln136 and Arg144 had very weak side-chain density, and for these residues the occupancy of the side-chain atoms was set to 0.5. Alternative side-chain conformations could be modeled for several residues (Ser31, Ser52, Val57, Thr84, Lys88, Thr99, Met104, and Lys112). The ®nal structure of PAK pilin contains 864 non-hydrogen protein atoms in 120 residues and 131 water molecules.

P. aeruginosa pilin has been found to bind glycoconjugates which contain a b-D-GalNAc(1 3 4)-bD-Gal moiety. Asialo-GM1 and asialo-GM2 glycolipids are believed to be important physiological receptors (Saiman & Prince, 1993; Gupta et al., 1994; de Bentzmann et al., 1996; Comolli et al., 1999), but binding to glycoproteins has also been described (Doig et al., 1989; Rudner et al., 1992; Hazlett et al., 1995; Wu et al., 1995). A variety of techniques including antibody mapping (Doig et al., 1990), mutagenesis (Farinha et al., 1994), studies with synthetic peptides (Doig et al., 1988; Irvin et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1989), and 2D-NMR (Campbell et al., 1997a) all indicate that the receptor-binding site is located in the C-terminal disul®de-bonded loop (boxed in Figure 1). Surprisingly, there is signi®cant sequence variation in this region between different strains (Figure 1), even though all strains are believed to still bind the same receptors (Ramphal et al., 1984). As a consequence, immunisation with puri®ed pili does not generally protect against subsequent challenge with strains other than that used for immunization. The observation that strains have conserved binding speci®city suggests that they still share common features in their receptor-binding site. This raises the possibility that a strain-independent therapeutic can be found in the form of a receptor mimetic or by raising a cross-reactive immune response. Indeed, cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies have been reported (Lee et al., 1990; Sheth et al., 1995) and a peptide-based vaccine that optimizes the generation of a cross-reactive immune response is in development (Wong et al., 1994; Ê Cachia et al., 1998). Here, we present the 1.63 A crystal structure of P. aeruginosa strain PAK (PAK pilin) and discuss its features and its use towards designing an improved peptide-based vaccine.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination and structure quality Crystallization of full-length P. aeruginosa pilin has proved to be extremely dif®cult due to poor solubility and reproducibility (N.E.C. Duke and R.J.R., unpublished results). Based on the MS11 pilin structure it became clear that this was due to the fully exposed and highly hydrophobic N-terminal a-helix (Figures 1 and 2). Since receptor binding is mediated by the C-terminal domain, we have prepared a truncated recombinant pilin molecule encoding residues 29 to 144 of the mature PAK pilin (see Materials and Methods). Extensive functional studies on a similarly truncated strain K122-4 pilin show that the truncated product retains its binding properties (Irvin et al., unpublished results). These results, the lack of interactions between the N-terminal a-helix and the binding site, and preliminary binding data for truncated PAK pilin (not shown), all indicate that truncated PAK pilin also retains a functional recep-

(a) N-terminally truncated PAK pilin. The truncated hydrophobic N-terminal helix (gray) was modeled on the basis of the MS11 model. N-terminal residues derived from the OmpA fusion construct are colored cyan. The minor b-sheet is shown in yellow. The outside strands are drawn as smaller arrows to indicate the fact that only a single residue is involved in proper b-sheet hydrogen bonding. Positions of the cisproline residues are shown by ®lled triangles. The C-terminal disul®de-bonded loop, which contains the proposed binding site and is the focus of peptide-based vaccine design is boxed and the disul®de bond is shown as ball-and-stick model with yellow bonds. The boxed area is shown in more detail in Figure 4(a). (b) MS11 pilin (Parge et al., 1995). The color scheme is as above with the addition of using pink for the C-terminal b-hairpin. The glycosylation at position 63 is shown as a ball-and-stick model. This Figure, as well as Figures 4 and 5, were created with the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

Structure description Figure 2 shows a representation of (a) the N-terminally truncated PAK pilin structure, next to (b) full-length MS11 pilin. These structures share a basic fold consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (the major b-sheet, green) packed onto an a-helix (blue). In total 83 Ca atoms of MS11 pilin could be superimposed on the PAK pilin structure, Ê giving an r.m.s.d. of 1.9 A. These Ca atoms were distributed over seven segments (printed in bold font in Figure 1). Although MS11 and PAK pilin are clearly related, signi®cant differences exist as would be expected from the high sequence divergence. A major difference occurs immediately after the a-helix. In MS11 pilin, the a-helix is followed by an irregular loop that is glycosylated at Ser63 (Figure 2(b)) and phosphorylated at Ser68 (Parge et al., 1995; Forest et al., 1999). In PAK pilin, this region forms three short irregular b-strands (the minor b-sheet, yellow in Figure 2(a)). No posttranslational modi®cation was observed, as expected from the fact that the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. However, even in its natural host no MS11-like post-translational modi®cation is believed to occur in PAK pilin, as Ser63 and Ser68 are replaced by Ala and Gly, respectively. MS11 pilin can also have a-glycerophosphate

attached to residue Ser94 (Stimson et al., 1996; Forest et al., 1999), but again the corresponding residue has been replaced by glycine in PAK pilin. Furthermore, biochemical data have indicated that PAK and PAO pilin are not glycosylated or phosphorylated (Paranchych et al., 1979). Therefore our structure should re¯ect the mature protein except for the N-terminal truncation. It has been noted previously that P. aeruginosa pilin sequences for strains CD, PA103, PAO, T2A, and PAK are more closely related to each other than to the pilins of strains K122-4 and P1 (Pasloske et al., 1988; Castric & Deal, 1994). When the sequence data are combined with the new structural knowledge it appears that the minor bsheet of PAK pilin is also present in strains CD, PA103, PAO, and T2A. In contrast, the corresponding loop structure of MS11 pilin appears to be shared by the pilins of the N. meningitidis FAM18 strain and the P. aeruginosa K122-4 and P1 strains (Figure 1). The closer structural relationship of some P. aeruginosa pilin strains with gonococcal homologues is further supported by the fact that K122-4 pilin is more closely related to the N. meningitidis FAM18 pilin (45.6 % identity for the globular domain) than to the pilins of the other P. aeruginosa strains (best match is 23.3 % identity with strain PAK). The division of pilin sequences

1009 often, but not always, occupied by either a proline residue (as in PAK pilin) or a glycine residue (as in MS11 pilin). The curve introduced into the helix may be required for proper packing of monomers in the ®ber. Another structural feature of interest in PAK pilin is the double cis-proline loop which terminates b-strand 1 (Figure 3). The double cisproline loop brings aspartate 90 into a position where it can make favourable hydrogen bonds with the side-chain hydroxyl group and mainchain nitrogen atom of Ser59. In addition, it brings Ala92 into a position where it can form b-sheettype hydrogen bonds with valine 57, thereby bridging the minor and major b-sheets (shown as a small yellow arrow in Figure 2(a)). These interactions may be important for PAK pilin but, since the proline residues are not conserved in any other pilin, the interactions cannot be critical for function. Two cis-proline residues separated by only a single residue are rare but not unique in the structural database. A scan of all PDB entries with the program WHAT IF (Vriend, 1990) revealed ®ve Ê other occurrences in proteins re®ned to 3.0 A or higher resolution. These are (PDB codes in parentheses); Fab heavy chain (12E8 and many others), arylsulfatase A (1AUK), methionyl-tRNA fmet formyltransferase (1FMT), Fe-only hydrogenase (1FEH), and N-cadherin (1NCG). No common role for the cis-proline residues is apparent from these structures. Receptor-binding loop Extensive studies using antibody mapping (Doig et al., 1990), synthetic peptides (Doig et al., 1988;

into two groups may also be relevant to glycosylation as P1 pilin, like the Neisseria pilins, has been reported to be glycosylated (Castric, 1995). It is interesting that a gene required for glycosylation was detected just downstream from the pilin gene in strain P1 and its close homologues, but not in the same location in the PAK-like pilin strains (Castric, 1995). Glycosylation of P1 pilin could take place at the threonine residue that corresponds to Ser63 in MS11 (Figure 1). Threonine is also conserved in K122-4 pilin but the presence of glycosylation or a pilO-related gene has not been studied for this strain. A second large structural deviation between MS11 and PAK pilin is located near the C terminus of the molecule where a two-stranded b-hairpin in MS11 pilin (pink in Figure 2(b)) is missing from the PAK pilin structure. The b-hairpin in MS11 pilin corresponds to the hypervariable region and sequence analysis indicates that this b-hairpin is found only in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis pilins. It is interesting that the b-hairpin is not present in all Neisseria pilin sequences, as N. meningitidis strain FAM18 pilin, referred to as a class II pilin (Aho et al., 1997), lacks the b-hairpin (Figure 1). Both the FAM18 and K122-4 pilins appear to have a chimeric nature with an MS11-like irregular loop following the N-terminal a-helix and a PAK-like C-terminal disul®de-linked loop. We anticipate being able to verify this observation in the near future, as crystals of a truncated K122-4 pilin have Ê been obtained that diffract to 1.8 A (unpublished results). Both PAK and MS11 pilin have a distortion in their a-helix around residue 42. This position is

Figure 4. Stereo images of the receptor-binding loop. (a) Enlarged view of the boxed area of Figure 2(a) with residues 132 to 144 shown in ball-and-stick representation. Bonds that connect main-chain atoms are shown in cyan to highlight the main-chain conformation. Every fourth residue, starting at residue 132, has been numbered. The hydrogen bonds between residues i and i  3 of the b-turns are shown as bold broken lines. Note that residues 135 to 144 form a surface that is dominated by main-chain atoms. Five water molecules located in the proposed binding pocket (purple spheres) that are connected to their hydrogen-bonding partners are shown with broken lines. Glu135 has a disordered side-chain and the side-chain atoms beyond Cb are therefore not depicted. (b) Superposition of the receptor-binding loop of PAK pilin (continuous line) and the corresponding region in MS11 pilin (broken line). The mainchain atoms, including Cb, are shown plus the side-chains of the strictly conserved cysteine and proline residues, and Thr150 of MS11 pilin. Residues 124 to 140 of MS11 pilin, which form the extra b-hairpin, are not shown. The ®rst bturn (labeled I) is a type I turn in both structures. However, the second b-turn (labeled II) is a type II turn in PAK and a type I turn in MS11. This difference results from a peptide ¯ip (labeled *), most likely due to Thr150 in MS11 pilin (see the text). Another difference of interest is the change in the chi-1 dihedral angle of one of the strictly conserved cysteine residues (labeled ).

Irvin et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1989), mutagenesis (Farinha et al., 1994), and 2D-NMR (Campbell et al., 1997a) all point to the presence of a receptor-binding site in the C-terminal disul®de-bonded loop. This loop is boxed in Figures 1 and 2(a) and is shown in more detail in Figure 4(a). Previous 2D NMR studies on peptides corresponding to the receptor-binding loop in P. aeruginosa strains PAK, PAO, KB7, and P1 revealed the conservation of a type I b-turn followed by a type II b-turn (Asp134 to Phe137 and Pro139 to Cys142, respectively in

PAK) (McInnes et al. 1993, Campbell et al., 1997a,b). The PAK crystal structure contains bturns of the predicted types in the same locations. However, the orientation of the b-turns with respect to each other differs, mostly due to a 120  difference in the psi main-chain dihedral angle of Phe137. NMR data have indicated that Pro139 occurs in both the cis and trans con®guration in a peptide corresponding to residues 128-144 of PAK pilin. Our structure shows that in the presence of the complete globular domain, Pro139 adopts a

1011 brane, but a more general effect such as peptide solubility cannot be excluded. Gly141 is conserved in most P. aeruginosa pilins, but has been replaced by asparagine and threonine in strains P1 and K122-4, respectively. Asparagine may still be able to adopt phi/psi angles close to 99  /À 14  ; however, threonine is much more restricted and it is highly unlikely to adopt such main-chain dihedral angles. Accordingly, we predict a distinctly different main-chain conformation around this residue in the K122-4 strain. It is interesting that the MS11 structure also contains threonine at the corresponding position and a peptide ¯ip is indeed observed in the structure (labeled with * in Figure 4(b)). This changes the type II bturn in PAK pilin into a type I b-turn in MS11 pilin. In spite of this, the main-chain conformation of the receptor-binding loops in PAK pilin and MS11 pilin remain very similar (Figure 4(b)) and residues 129, 130 and 133 to 142 of PAK pilin can be superimposed on the corresponding atoms in Ê MS11 pilin with an r.m.s.d. of 1.0 A for 12 Ca atoms. We predict that K122-4 pilin will have two type I b-turns, like MS11 pilin. Interestingly, binding studies demonstrate that truncated K122-4 pilin can still bind asialo-GM1 (R.T.I., unpublished results), indicating that receptor speci®city has not been lost. Carbohydrate-binding sites typically contain an aromatic residue which acts as a hydrophobic stacking surface. This is especially true for the binding of b-galactosyl moieties which have a distinct hydrophobic face (Rini, 1995). Furthermore, carbohydrate-binding sites typically form hydrogen bonds with the sugar hydroxyl groups using side-chain atoms or a mixture of side-chain and main-chain atoms. In our proposed binding cleft there is a notable lack of side-chains to provide either hydrophobic or hydrogen bonding functions. However, Ile138 in the center of the proposed binding surface, and the Ca and Cb atoms of surrounding residues could provide hydrophobic interactions for carbohydrate binding and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms and amide nitrogen atoms could hydrogen bond to the carbohydrate ligand. In the crystal structure, ®ve water molecules are found in the proposed receptor-binding pocket (shown as purple spheres in Figure 4(a)). These water molecules interact with main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues Ile138 and Cys142, and with the main-chain nitrogen atoms of residues Gly141 and Arg144. These interactions could mimic those of hydroxyl groups of the receptor. We have explored potential receptor-binding modes by molecular docking calculations of a GalNAc-Gal disaccharide with the program package DockVision (Hart et al., 1997). Several receptor dockings were obtained, but none was signi®cantly more plausible than the others. It is clear that an experimental structure of a pilin molecule in complex with a receptor analogue is required to ®rmly establish the location and mode of receptor binding.

trans conformation as had been suggested based on antibody-induced conformational changes of the cis but not the trans conformer (Campbell et al., 1997a). A detailed view of the disulphide-bonded loop is given in Figure 4(a). This shows that the b-turns are oriented such that their main-chain-dominated faces are solvent-accessible and pointing towards each other. The result is a V-shaped groove lined by main-chain atoms. This pattern is further extended by the main-chain atoms of residues Ile138, Ser143, and the C-terminal Arg144. Cys129, Phe137, Pro 139 and Cys142 are the most conserved amino acid residues in the receptor-binding loop and might therefore have been expected to take part in receptor binding. Interestingly, the structure shows that the side-chains of these residues are not solvent-accessible. Instead, they are located in the interface between the receptor-binding loop and the body of the protein and their main function appears to be to stabilize the conformation of the loop. The picture which emerges is that the protein-receptor interactions may be formed exclusively, or predominantly, by mainchain rather than side-chain atoms. Conservation of the main-chain conformation rather than primary sequence would therefore be critical for function. The NMR observation that peptides corresponding to the disulphide-bonded loop of four distinct P. aeruginosa pilin strains all conserve the two b-turns, and that antibody or receptor binding does not induce large conformational changes, ®ts in this picture of a conserved main-chain conformation. Wong et al. (1995) have used single alanine replacement studies of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 128 to 144 of a PAK pilin variant (the variant has lysine as residue 144 rather than arginine as in our structure) to determine the residues important for binding to A549 cells. Residues Ser131, Gln136, Ile138, Pro139, Gly141, and Lys144 were found to be important for binding. Ile138 occupies a central position in the loop (Figure 4(a)) and therefore can be expected to contribute signi®cantly to structural stability. Pro139 is completely conserved and the restricted phi-psi space of proline residues may be relevant to stabilize the structure of the loop. Gly141 has mainchain phi/psi angles of 99  /À 14  . These are unfavourable for non-glycine residues and an alanine replacement could therefore be expected to affect the main-chain structure. Ser131 is oriented such that its side-chain hydroxyl group makes a well-de®ned hydrogen bond to the main-chain nitrogen atom of Gln133. So again, a replacement by an alanine residue would likely affect the mainchain conformation or stability. Gln136 and Lys144 (Arg144 in our structure) do not appear to affect the main-chain conformation as their side-chains are disordered and do not interact with other protein atoms. These side-chains could, in principle, interact directly with the receptor or the cell mem-

1012 Binding site relative to the fiber model High-af®nity binding of lectins to carbohydrates is achieved by multi-valent binding (Rini, 1995). This can be accomplished either by distinct binding sites on a single molecule, by identical binding sites on a multimeric complex, or by a combination of the above. For P. aeruginosa pilins there is evidence for only a single binding site per monomer. Therefore, to achieve multi-valency, multiple monomers at the tip of the pilus should contribute to binding. One class of important physiological receptors for P. aeruginosa pili are believed to be the glycolipids asialo-GM1 and asialo-GM2 (Saiman & Prince, 1993; Gupta et al., 1994; de Bentzmann et al., 1996; Comolli et al., 1999). Since glycolipids are presented on a ¯at cell surface, multi-valent binding in this case requires that the binding sites are presented on one face of the protein so as to be able to simultaneously engage the receptors. For pili, the presentation of the binding sites can only be appreciated in the context of the assembled ®ber. Figure 5 shows the PAK ®ber model based on the assembly parameters described by Parge et al. (1995). The model is sterically plausible and its distribution of buried and exposed surfaces ®ts expectations. However, the binding sites are ill-positioned for their function if the tip of the pilus is located at the C-terminal end of the main a-helix, as is currently assumed (Forest & Tainer, 1997). First, access to the binding site is blocked by the minor b-sheet of a neighbouring subunit in all monomers, including the terminal monomer (Figure 5). Adjustments of the pilus assembly parameters may expose the binding site of the terminal monomer, but the binding sites of the other monomers at the tip of the pilus would remain occluded. Furthermore, even if all binding sites of the terminal ®ve monomers were exposed, they would clearly not be presented on one face of the pilus (Figure 5). In the current ®ber-assembly model, the monomers are related by a 5-fold screw operation along the ®ber axis. Since the crystal symmetry includes a 4-fold screw axis, it is conceivable that the crystal packing re¯ects some aspects of the pilus assembly. However, visual inspection of the crystal packing arrangement suggests that this is not the case. The X-ray ®ber diffraction pattern calculated for the proposed model of MS11 pili does not ®t the observed ®ber diffraction data from type IV pili (Folkhard et al., 1981) (J.H. Davies, L.C. Welsh & D.A. Marvin, unpublished results). The true pilus structure could be substantially different. It is even conceivable to have a ®ber formed from discs of pentamers rather than a single-start helical arrangement. This would place all binding sites at the tip of the pilus in an identical environment and equidistant from the membrane, not unlike the situation in bacterial toxin B-pentamers (Merritt et al., 1994; Ling et al., 1998). Although attractive from a functional perspective, the binding sites would still be too far from the tip of the pilus to

1013 for its immunogenic properties. One of the design goals for the peptide-based vaccine is therefore to stabilize a native-like conformation of the peptide. The crystal structure now provides us with a detailed picture of the native conformation for PAK pilin and the natural set of interactions that contributes to its stability. Modi®ed peptides can now be designed to further stabilize the observed structure. The structure also identi®es residues that do not appear to contribute to structural stability. Alterations at these positions can be considered to improve cross-reactivity, solubility or other desirable properties. For instance, mutation of Glu135 in PAK pilin to an Ala residue was found previously to signi®cantly enhance cross-reactivity (Wong et al., 1994; Cachia et al., 1998). Conclusion The crystal structure of PAK pilin presented here provides us with the most accurate model of a type IV pilin currently available. The disulphidebonded loop structure reveals the epitope to which a protective immune response should be generated by a peptide-based vaccine. In addition, the structure of the disulphide-bonded loop, its packing onto the remainder of the protein, and the existing biochemical data narrow down the location of the receptor-binding site to a V-shaped groove ¯anked by two b-turns. The position of the binding site is rather surprising given the current model for the pilus ®ber and may require a re-thinking of some of our assumptions on type IV pilus ®ber structure. The observation that P. aeruginosa pilins from several strains bind the same receptor in spite of signi®cant sequence variation, may be linked to the fact that the proposed binding surface is dominated by main-chain atoms. Therefore, conservation of binding af®nity and speci®city can be achieved without strict sequence conservation as long as the main-chain conformation is retained.

rearrangement that brings the binding sites closer to the membrane, or if we assume an inverted polarity of the pilus, e.g. with the N-terminal hydrophobic helix directed towards the pilus tip. A structural rearrangement of a pilin monomer upon ®ber assembly is not without precedent, as there is structural evidence for chaperone-catalyzed b-strand swapping in the assembly of the P pilus (Sauer et al., 1999). A similar function of chaperones might play a role in type IV pilus assembly and could explain the energy requirement of this process and the inability to spontaneously form type IV ®bers from its monomers (Watts et al., 1982). In a model where the N terminus of the a-helix is exposed at the tip of the pilus, the receptor-binding sites are occluded for all monomers except those at the tip of the pilus (Figure 5). This ®ts the biochemical observations. Proposing an inverted pilus polarity is not unreasonable, as the currently assumed polarity is not based on experimental observations (Forest & Tainer, 1997). Instead, it is based on the fact that it seems more plausible to have the hydrophobic N-terminal a-helices buried in the bacterial membrane, rather than exposed to the solvent. The latter issue would be resolved if the hydrophobic helices were proteolytically removed from the monomers located at the pilus tip. In this respect it is important to note that Nterminally truncated pilin (S-pilin), in which the hydrophobic a-helix has been deleted, is secreted by certain N. gonorrhoeae variants (Haas et al., 1987). However, the actual existence of exposed hydrophobic helices at the pilus tip does not have to be excluded. Indeed, it may even be relevant for function as initial membrane adherence through carbohydrate-binding may be followed by insertion of the hydrophobic helices, not unlike the sequence of events in hemolysins (Rossjohn et al., 1998). Implications for vaccine design A long-standing goal of the research into P. aeruginosa pilins has been to develop a suitable vaccine against this pathogen. Studies with antiserum generated by immunisation with various pilin-derived peptides has shown that only antiserum directed at the C-terminal receptor-binding loop inhibits binding of pili to target cells (Lee et al., 1989). It is interesting that the titers of this anti-peptide antiserum against the peptide itself were approximately the same as the titers against the PAK protein, unlike all other tested anti-peptide antisera which reacted much more weakly with the whole pilin molecule (Lee et al., 1989). This may be due to the fact that the receptor-binding loop peptide retains a nativelike pair of b-turns in solution (McInnes et al. 1993, Campbell et al., 1997a). The receptor-binding loop peptide has also been found to induce a cross-reactive immune response. For optimal cross-reactivity, the disulphide bond had to be formed. This again suggests the importance of structure of the peptide

Materials and Methods
The production of truncated PAK pilin follows the same procedures used to prepare a truncated strain K122-4 pilin (Irvin et al., unpublished results). In brief, DNA encoding PAK pilin residues 29 to 144 was obtained by PCR from the full-length PAK pilin gene (Pasloske et al., 1988) using the oligonucleotides SP-5 (5H GGAATTCGCTCGTTCGGAAGGCGCA-3H ) and SP-6 (5H -CCCAAGCTTCTTACAAAATTACCTAGA-3H ). The ampli®ed DNA fragment was puri®ed on an 8 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, puri®ed by phenol-extraction, and ligated in-frame behind the OmpA leader sequence of plasmid pRLD (Tripet et al. 1996). The construct was sequenced in both directions and was found to contain no errors. E. coli BL21 harbouring the expression plasmid was grown at 37  C, with shaking, in LB broth containing carbenicillin (100 mg/ml) to an absorbance of A550 0.5-0.7. Expression of the truncated protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a ®nal concentration of 1 mM. The bacteria were grown for an

1014
additional six hours at 37  C before the expressed periplasmic protein was extracted by osmotic shock. The protein was puri®ed by sequential column chromatography using DEAE-cellulose (15 cm Â 0.5 cm, DE-32, Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ), carboxymethyl-cellulose (30 cm Â 2 cm, CM-52, Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ), and Sephadex G-75 (48 cm Â 1 cm, Super®ne, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) columns, respectively. The puri®ed protein appeared as a single band on SDSPAGE and its identity was con®rmed by N-terminal sequencing and immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-PAK pilus antisera. The ®nal product contained seven residues derived from the expression vector (AlaLeu-Glu-Gly-Thr-Glu-Phe), followed by residues 29 to 144 of mature PAK pilin. Crystals were grown by mixing 3 ml of a 10 mg/ml protein solution in doubly distilled water with 3 ml of precipitant (60 % (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 8.2)) on a cover slip which was then suspended over a well with 1 ml of precipitant solution. Crystals of irregular shape grew normally within ten days at room temperature and were crushed to serve as nuclei for microseeding. To this end hanging drops were set up as described above but after 6 to 12 hours of preequilibration some micro seeds were added. After growth, well-shaped small crystals (<0.05 mm) were selected, washed in 58 % (v/v) (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 8.2), and added to fresh pre-equilibrated hanging drops. Crystals typically grew to a size of 0.3 mm Â 0.3 mm Â 0.2 mm and had spacegroup P41212 with cell Ê Ê dimensions of a  b  38.1 A and c  149.8 A. The native and gold cyanide derivative datasets were each collected from a single crystal at room temperature. CuKa radiation, generated by an Elliot GX-13 rotating anode generator (0.1 mm cathode operated at 40 kV, 60 mA), was focussed by a Supper mirror and data were collected on a MAR300 image plate detector. The gold cyanide dataset was collected from a crystal that had been soaked for 22 hours in precipitant solution containing 20 mM KAu(CN)2. The uranyl acetate dataset was collected at room temperature on beamline 7.2 at the Ê SRS (Daresbury, UK) using a wavelength of 1.448 A.

Crystal Structure of P. aeruginosa PAK Pilin A full dataset was collected from a single crystal that had been soaked for 24 hours in 60 % (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5), 40 mM uranyl acetate. All data were integrated with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) and scaled by SCALA (Evans, 1993). Scaling of the derivatives used the native data as a reference and allowed variation of the scale factor over the detector surface. Further data processing was carried out with the programs from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computing Project, Number 4, 1994). Localisation of the heavy atoms and subsequent phasing was carried out by SOLVE (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999) using isomorphous and anomalous differences. Both P41212 and P43212 space groups were tested, and the results for P41212 were clearly superior. The resulting density map was ®nally subjected to solvent ¯attening, histogram mapping and multi-resolution modi®cation using DM (Cowtan, 1994). This improved Ê the ®gure of merit from 0.56 to 0.80 for all data to 2.5 A. Data processing and phasing statistics are given in Table 1. Building of the main chain was carried out by wARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1997) using the map coef®cients from DM and all available native data. Side-chains were built using the X®t program from the XtalView package (McRee, 1999). The model was re®ned in four rounds using the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) and standard protocols. An explicit bulk solvent correcÈ tion was calculated with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and scaled by 0.85 prior to use in REFMAC as this was found to give a better agreement with the observed structure factors based on structure factor correlation analysis. All data were used for re®nement with 750 re¯ections set aside for Rfree calculation and sA estimation. Each re®nement round was followed by model building with X®t using cross-validated SIGMAAweighted density maps (Read, 1997). Water molecules were added using wARP. Several residues were modeled with alternative side-chain conformations. In these cases the occupancy was ®xed at 0.5 for both conformations while the B-factors were re®ned. Individual anisotropic B-values were re®ned for two cycles at the very end of
