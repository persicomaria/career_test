Abstract

Crystals of tetragonal hen egg-white lysozyme were grown using Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility (APCF) apparatus under a microgravity environment (SpaceHab-01 mission) and ground control conditions. Crystals were grown from NaCI as a crystallizing agent at pH 4.3. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the best diffracting ground- and space-grown crystals were recorded using synchrotron radiation and an image plate on the W32 beamline at LURE. Both ground- and space-grown crystals showed nearly equivalent maximum resolution of 1.3-1.4,~. Refinements were carried out with the program X-PLOR with final R values of 18.45 and 18.27% for structures from ground- and spacegrown crystals, respectively. The two structures are nearly identical with the root-mean-square difference on all protein atoms being 0.13/~. Some residues of the two refined structures show multiple alternative conformations. Two ions were localized into the electron-density maps of the two structures: one chloride ion at the interface between two symmetry-related molecules and one sodium ion stabilizing the loop Ser60-Leu75. The sodium ion is surrounded by six ligands which form a bipyramid around it at distances of 2.2-2.6 A,.
1. Introduction

The first X-ray structure determination of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) was a tetragonal form of the enzyme (Blake, Fenn, North, Phillips & Poljak, 1962; Blake et al., 1965; Phillips, 1966, 1967; Blake et al., 1967; Blake, Mair, North, Phillips & Sarma, 1967). Then, the structures of triclinic, monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal forms have been determined at different resolutions and under various conditions of temperature and pressure (Table 1). Egg-white lysozyme structures from different sources are often referred to as 'lysozyme' independently of the origin and space group creating some confusion when comparisons are performed. For the sake of clarity, Table 1 summarizes parts of the data concerning egg-white lysozymes from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et al., 1977; Abola,

Bernstein, Bryant, Koetzle & Weng, 1987). The purpose of this paper is to describe and compare the two highresolution structures of HEWL from one ground-grown crystal (1.33/~ resolution data) and from one spacegrown crystal (1.40 A, resolution data) and to compare them with other egg-white lysozyme structures. The aim of a European group of protein crystal growers was to use a well characterized protein to quantify the influence of microgravity on nucleation rate, potential improvement of diffraction and mosaicity. A well characterized protein is one that has been properly defined from a biochemical (purity, ion-spray mass spectrometry) and a physical chemistry point of view (solubility diagram, X-ray structure). It was thus possible to make a calibration of the X-ray properties of ground-grown crystals to compare them with spacegrown ones using identical conditions except the level of gravity. The reasons for the choice of hen egg-white lysozyme as a model protein were multiple: the structure of lysozyme is known at high resolution (Madhusudan, Kodandapani & Vijayan, 1993; Harata, 1994; Pike & Acharya, 1994; Kurinov & Harrison, 1995), it is easily available in gram quantities, it crystallizes in a time span compatible with the duration of a US Shuttle flight, its phase diagram on earth is known at various temperatures (Ataka & Asai, 1988; Howard, Twigg, Baird & Meehan, 1988; Guilloteau, Ri~s-Kautt & Ducruix, 1992), and it is one of the most extensively studied proteins in crystallogenesis (Feher & Kam, 1985; Ataka & Asai, 1988; Ri~s-Kautt & Ducruix, 1989; Mikol, Hirsch & Giegr, 1990; DeMattei & Feigelson, 1992; Monaco & Rosenberger, 1993; Forsythe & Pusey, 1994). The Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility (APCF) apparatus was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and constructed by Dornier. An APCF flight unit (48 reactors) (Bosch, Lautenschlager, Potthast & Stapelmann, 1992) became available for a maiden flight on the SpaceHab-01 mission in June 1993. Four European laboratories decided to share 25 reactors of the flight unit, for a joint experiment coordinated by M. Rirs-Kautt. Five series of five experiments were carried out at two different protein

The complexes of egg-white lysozyme with Fv or Fab fragments were deliberately omitted. For each species, the lysozyme structures are sorted by the highest symmetry, then for each space group by the highest resolution. Solvent is the number of water molecules used in the refinement. Reso is the maximum resolution data. B factor contains the mean temperature factor for the overall protein atoms (main and side chains) with the solvent excluded from the calculation. In case of two molecules in the asymmetric unit, two values of B factor are present. B factor is computed with the program ACT (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 (1994).

For a valid comparison of crystals grown on earth and in space it was necessary to set up an identical apparatus which experienced similar events (transportation, aging, temperature). A complete set of spare reactors, identical to the one used in flight, was filled, transported and activated in parallel with the space experiment to be used as a ground control. The flight experiments were activated during 7.5 d, but remained under microgravity for an additional 2d before landing. Crystallization was performed by the three techniques available, with a volume of protein solution of 67 and 4501.tl and identical supersaturation, calculated from the phase diagram at 291 K. The preparation, the controls and results of these experiments will be described in details elsewhere (Ri~s-Kautt et al., 1996). All the HEWL crystals obtained from the ground and space experiments belong to the tetragonal system P432~2. Among these crystals grown in the different reactors with different techniques, six from each set (ground control and space experiment) were chosen according to their quality and their size, and mounted into capillaries. Partial X-ray diffraction data were recorded for these crystals using synchrotron radiation (station W32, LURE) in order to measure the mosaic spread and the resolution limit, and to compare their quality. To this end, the partial data sets of the six APCF ground-grown crystals were averaged and the same procedure was applied to the six APCF space-grown crystals. Corresponding Wilson plots and I/cr curves perfectly superimpose. Therefore, using the conditions of crystallization described in this paper (temperature, pH, supersaturation) we do not observe any significant difference between space and ground crystals of the tetragonal form of HEW lysozyme.

In this paper we focus on the description of the high-resolution structure of HEWL from a ground-grown crystal (1.33 A, resolution data) and the comparison with the data and structure from a space-grown crystal (1.40 ~ resolution data). The two refined structures from ground- and space-grown crystals will be then compared with other egg-white lysozyme structures.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization and data collection

Throughout this study, a single batch of lysozyme chloride was used without further purification for ground and space experiments (Cat. No. L-2879, lot 51H7150, Sigma). Using denaturing gel electrophoresis and highperformance size-exclusion chromatography, it was found that it contains less than 0.3%(w/w) contaminant proteins. Purity was assessed by electrospray mass spectroscopy and gave a molecular weight of 14 306 Da (Ri~s-Kautt, Ducruix & Van Dorsselaer, 1994). The crystals used in this work were grown in the presence of 1.25 M NaC1 (supersaturation 8) in the space experiment and 1.65M (supersaturation 15) in the ground control condition and in 50 mM Na acetate buffer at pH 4.3, with a protein solution of 10 mg ml -l. As improvements in resolution were measured for a dozen of the analyzed tetragonal crystals obtained in the different reactors compared with the HEWL structures described in the PDB (Table 1), the two high-resolution diffracting crystals (the largest for the ground-grown crystal and one of the larger for the space-grown one) obtained by the dialysis technique from the ground and space experiments, were chosen to collect complete diffraction data using X-ray synchrotron radiation. Measurements were made at 279 K on the wiggler beamline W32 (Fourme et al., 1992) at LURE (syn-

Complete diffraction data were collected with only one crystal from ground control conditions and one crystal from the space experiment. For each crystal, three data sets were collected: one at low resolution and two at high resolution (referred in Table 2 as low, high and cusp data). The weighted least-squares R factors on intensity for symmetry-related observations were 4.6% for the ground-grown crystal and 4.1% for the space-grown crystal. The details of the experimental conditions of data collection are shown in Table 2. As no larger imageplate system was available at the W32 station at the time of recording, the detector was offset to allow data collection at higher resolution for some of the data sets. X-ray data were processed with the program MOSFLM (Leslie, 1987) adapted by P. Gouet to take into account the translation of the detector. Throughout this text, the structures of lysozyme from the ground-grown and space-grown crystals will be referred to as the ground and space structures, respectively.

2.2. Refinement of protein structures The starting model for refinement of the groundgrown crystal was taken from the refined atomic coordinates (entry 6LYT) of H E W lysozyme obtained from the PDB and corresponding to the tetragonal form at 298 K (Young, Tilton & Dewan, 1994). All water molecules were removed from the initial model. This model was refined first with a rigid-body procedure and then with the conjugate-gradient facility of X-PLOR (Briinger, 1992b) using the accurate parameters described by Engh

& Huber (1991). The same procedure was used for the space-grown crystal with the refined coordinates of ground-grown crystal as the starting model. All the solvent found previously for the ground structure was included in the model of the space structure and the position of each water molecule was systematically checked after each cycle of refinement. During the early stages of refinement, it was decided to include the charges on charged residues such as Lys, Arg, Asp and Glu. The free R test (Brfinger, 1992a) was used to follow structure refinements. At high resolution, it proved to be extremely useful to detect abnormal behavior of the refinement. In total, 33 cycles of refinement were carried out on the ground structure and additional 14 cycles on the space structure. For the ground structure, the starting R factor was 42.8% (initial free R factor was 43.5%) before the rigid-body procedure to reach the value of 18.45% (final free R factor is 22.63%) at the final stage of refinement. Table 3 gives a summary of the refinement statistics for both the ground and space structures. PEAKMAX and WATPEAK programs from CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) were used to locate the water molecules at various stages of the refinement. Water molecules were inserted in the models with an initial isotropic B factor of 20/~2, if they formed at least one stereochemically reasonable hydrogen bond (between 2.6 and 3.4/~) and were above the 3 root-mean-square (r.m.s.) level of the IFol- IFcl difference-density maps. They were deleted a t the end of refinements if the corresponding electron density was less than the r.m.s, level of the 21Fol- IF,:l map. Water molecules with a thermal B factor less than three times the average B factor of the whole structure (protein

For the ground structure the limit was set up at 60/~2 while for the space structure at 65/~2; the difference takes into account the difference in the average B factor for the overall protein in the two structures (Table 3). A total of 142 and 138 water molecules were identified in the ground and space structures, respectively. Side chains were adjusted using the 2 1 F o l - IF<.l and the [F,,I-IF<. I electron-density maps displayed with TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1989). Only one loop (69-71) was rebuilt from the initial model 6LYT. The carbonyl group of Pro70 had to be inverted to fit the 21F<,l- IF<.l density map (Fig. la). This loop have the same conformation in the ground and space structures. Some amino acids (Lysl, Ser86 and Vail09 for the two structures, plus Asn59 for the ground structure) presented alternative conformations into the density (Fig. 1b) with a refined occupancy of almost 50% for each position. A total of 11 side chains at the surface of the lysozyme showed disordered conformations, the density being poorly defined around some atoms of these residues. The concerned residues were: Arg21, Arg61, Trp62, Arg73, Asn77, Lys97, Aspl01, Asnl03, Glnl21,

T E T R A G O N A L HEW LYSOZYME measured data as a function of resolution. The maximum resolution is the inverse value drnin of the largest value of the scattering vector modulus S (S= 2sin0/A) for which useful information on Bragg intensities can be extracted from a diffraction pattern recorded in given experimental conditions. At low resolution there was no difference in intensities between the two crystals. The values of B factors from the Wilson diagrams (Fig. 2a) were essentially estimated from about 2.0/~, to the high-resolution end of the plots. These calculated values showed a reduction in the mean isotropic B factor of almost 3 flk2 for the ground structure (14.7 ~2) compared to the space one (17.4 A2), leading to the suggestion that the space crystal is less ordered than the ground crystal. At the end of refinement, the average temperature factors of the protein atoms are 16.7 and 18.6 A 2 for the refined ground and space structures, respectively. The plots of the percentage of data with Ha greater than 3cr cutoff versus the resolution (Fig. 2b) and the plot of the average Ha versus the resolution (Fig. 2c)

Arg125, Leu 129 for the ground structure. For the space structure the disordered side chains were the same as for ground structure except for Arg61 and Asp l01 but included additional residues Asp119 and Argl28. Some residual positive peaks appeared in the IFol-[Fc] electron-density map near the S - - S bonds, probably linked to anisotropic behavior treated as isotropic. Disulfide bridges 6-127, 30-11, 64-80, and 76-94 had torsion angles o f - 9 1 . 5 , -70.1, 97.1 and 84.7 ° , respectively. The comparison of the two structures ground and space gave an overall r.m.s, difference of 0.07 A for the main-chain atoms and 0.13 A for the overall structures.

M. C. VANEY, S. MAIGNAN, M. RII~S-KAUTT AND A. DUCRUIX indicate that there is some difference in diffraction data between the ground-grown crystal and the space-grown one, but no improvements can be noticed for the crystal grown under microgravity compared with the one grown on earth under the same conditions except the level of gravity. 3.2. Accuracy of the ground and space structures The qualities of the ground and space structures were checked using several programs of geometry analysis such as geomanal (Brtinger, 1992b), act (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) and PROCHECK (Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss & Thornton, 1993). For the final ground and space structures the Ramachandran plots of the main-chain torsion angles (~p and ~(~) (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) did not show any bad conformations for residues which are localized in the favored and allowed regions of the (~p,'(~) diagram. The theoretical variations of the coordinates errors were evaluated using Luzzati plots (Luzzati, 1952) and corresponded to mean positional errors of 0.15 A for ground structure and in the range of 0.15-0.20 A for the space structure. 3.3. Cl- environment During the refinements of the ground and space structures, a very low temperature factor was observed for a water molecule bound at the interface between two molecules of lysozyme (8/12 in ground structure and 9.2A ~ in space one). These atomic temperature factors were lower than the average B factor of Co~ atoms (14.9 .&2 for ground crystal and 16.6 A2 for space crystal) and even lower than the lowest B factor of Cc~ (9.1 A2 for Co~ of Cys30 for ground structure and 10.4 A2 for the same atom in the space structure). Furthermore, the distances were larger than expected for a strong hydrogen bond between protein atoms with a water molecule. Also, the difference Fourier electron-density map IFol-IF,,I of this atom, considered as a water molecule, still showed a high positive peak leading to

511

the conclusion that another atom, ion or molecule with higher scattering factor could replaced this molecule initially modeled as a water molecule. Studies of lysozyme solutions at pH 4 by a fluorescence quenching technique (Sibille & Pusey, 1994) have shown that the number of chloride ions bound to the protein decreases when the concentration of NaC1 increases. But the presence of chloride in the HEWL crystal structures is not clearly established in the literature. Phillips (1967) was the first to mention the possible interaction of three chloride ions with the protein in the tetragonal lysozyme crystal. Then, Blake, Mair et al. (1967) localized more precisely a putative chloride ion at the interface of two HEW lysozyme molecules (2 A resolution data) bound to Arg114 and Ser24 of a symmetry-related molecule. With these considerations, the water molecule previously described was replaced by a chloride ion in the ground and space structures. Then, with the use of a stronger scattering factor, no more residual positive electron-density peak in the map was present at this site. With the C1- occupancy factor set to 1.0, the temperature factors of the C1- refined to values of 21.43 A2 for ground and 23.49/~,2 for space structures at the final stage of refinement. The contacts of the C1- with protein atoms are shown in Fig. 3 and involve the phenate of Tyr23 (the proton of this hydroxyl group can be considered as slightly positively charged), the Nb2 of Asn113 of a symmetry-related molecule as well as a water molecule. The coordination distances of the C1for the ground and space structures are listed in Table 4. In other protein crystal structures, few chloridebinding sites have been described: in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme (1.7/~ resolution data) (Nicholson, Becktel & Matthews, 1988; Bell et al., 1991), in pig pancreatic ~-amylase at 2.1/~ resolution (Buisson, Du6e, Haser & Payan, 1987; Qian, Haser & Payan, 1993; Larson, Greenwood, Cascio, Day & McPherson, 1994), where the C1- is known to activate the protein, in the deoxyhemoglobin mutant W37/3R at resolution of 1.9/1.

T E T R A G O N A L H E W LYSOZYME and sodium ion, the main argument to differentiate a sodium ion from a water molecule being the average distances between the ion and the ligands which should be close to 2.4/~. In the ground and space structures, the Na ÷ is located in the middle of the loop Ser60-Leu75 (Fig. 4) and makes six short distances (between 2.18 and 2.62/~) with the surrounding atoms. Fig. 5(a) shows the closest interaction of the Na ÷ with the surrounding atoms of the protein as well as with two water molecules. The atoms concerned are the carbonyl O atoms of residues Arg73, Cys64 and Ser60, the hydroxyl O atom of Ser72 and two water molecules. The thermal B factor of these atoms as well as the coordination distances of the Na ÷ are listed in Table 4 for the two lysozyme structures. In the ground and space structures, the coordination geometry of the sodium ion may be considered as a distorted octahedron (Fig. 5b). An identical situation occurred with the Japanese quail egg-white lysozyme (1.4/~ resolution data; PDB code 2IHL) where a Na ÷ was found at the same site, forming also a distorted octahedron with distances between 2.36 and 2.58/~ with the protein atoms and two water molecules (Houdusse, Bentley, Poljak, Souchon & Zhang, 1996). This kind of octahedral and distorted geometry was also seen in the major grove site of a nucleic acid structure (Chevrier et al., 1986). In crystallography of small organic molecules, this type of geometry is frequently observed for Na ÷, showing a preference for oxygen donor ligands (Cesario et al., 1993). 3.5.

in ribonuclease A (1.9 /~, resolution data) (BaudetNessler, Jullien, Crosio & Janin, 1993), where three chloride ions were described, and in the 1.7/~ structure of dihydrofolate reductase from E. coli (Bolin, Filman, Matthews, Hamlin & Kraut, 1982). In all these structures, the nearest amino acids or atoms forming close contacts with C1- are in majority the positively charged residue Arg, the atom N62 of Asn, water molecules, hydrophobic contacts, and also reported, some interactions with the atoms O71 of Thr and 0 7 of Ser. 3.4. Na ÷ environment Although Na + is abundant in physiological medium and is involved in the stabilization of surface charge on biological macromolecules, the interactions between Na + and proteins have been poorly described by X-ray crystallography because of the close values in scattering for sodium ion and a water molecule. Only high-resolution structures allow to distinguish between water molecules

In the present work, for the ground and space structures, alternative positions for residues Lysl, Ser86 and Vall09 were clearly observed without ambiguities. In addition, for the ground structure only, a second conformation for Asn59 was modeled. For all the alternative positions found in the ground and space structures, the occupancy factors were refined only at the last stage of the refinement process.

Fig. 4. Stereoview of the overall lysozyme ground structure. The Na+ ion is located inside the loop 60-73 and the interactions are symbolized by the dashed lines. The CI- ion is localized at the interface of two molecules and is at a distance of about 24/k from the Na+ ion (for ground and space structures). All the diagrams were produced using the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

M. C. VANEY, S. MAIGNAN, M. RIES-KAUTT AND A. DUCRUIX For residue Vall09 the two alternative positions for the group C3, C71, C72 are shown in Fig. l(b). Blake, Mair et al. (1967) first observed the alternative conformations for Val 109 in the H E W L structure. They noticed that only one C7 could be represented in the electrondensity map suggesting that the group C3, C71, C72 appeared to have some rotational freedom about the Ca---Cfl bond. Alternative conformations of this residue were also described in the paper of the tetragonal crystal forms of HEWL at 1.5 ]k resolution (Strynadka & James, 1991) for the native protein and for the protein bound to a trisaccharide, as well as in the H E W L mutant structure (D52S) bound with an oligosaccharide product (1.9/~ resolution data) (Hadfield et al., 1994). The side chain of Ser86 initially modeled as only one main conformation had high B values in the early stage of refinement (23.5/~2 for 0 7 in ground structure). During the next steps of refinement the C ~ - - O 7 bond appeared to be disordered and two different side-chain positions could be clearly modeled into the electrondensity map. The two positions observed for Ser86

513

correspond to the two preferred conformations obtained for serine residues from an analysis of protein structures (Janin, Wodak, Levitt & Maigret, 1978). Serine seems to be a candidate for conformational disorder in some protein structures because of its low barrier of rotation around the C a - - - C 3 bond. In the ground structure, the refined occupancy factor of the 0 7 atom of Ser86 is the same (Qoc~ = 0.50) for the two positions (Xl = 49, X( = 293.70) · But in the space structure, the occupancies of this atom in the two conformations (Xt = 47.3, X( = 295.8°) were refined to a different value (Q,,~ = 0.6, ! Q,~:c = 0.4). In the two structures, one conformation (X1 = 49 ° for ground and X1 = 47.3 ° for space) is stabilized by an hydrogen bonding to a water molecule (distance of 2.82/~) while no interaction seems to exist for the second alternative position of 0 7 . Spatially close to the Ser86, the residue Lysl adopts two conformations for its terminal side-chain atoms (Ce, N(). In the ground structure, one of the position of N ( atom is hydrogen-bonded with several water molecules and in interaction with Oc2 from residue Glu7; the

TETRAGONAL HEW LYSOZYME well defined for three atoms (C(2, c~12 and C(3) of the six-membered ring, the next residue Trp63 is very well resolved as shown in Fig. 6. In the orthorhombic form of HEWL (Berthou, Lifchitz, Artymiuk & Joll~s, 1983) the crystal contacts stabilize the motions of the side chain of Trp62 and the loop Pro70-Gly71. This is not the case in the tetragonal form of lysozyme. The large B factors observed in the ground and space structures for the Trp62 side chain compared to other Trp residues in the molecule, are consistent with the absence of electron density in the 21F,,I- IFcl map for the second ring of the residue. Trp62 is a flexible residue that may rotate in the absence of the substrate and was found almost disordered in NMR studies (Smith, Sutcliffe, Redfield & Dobson, 1993). However, it is part of the active-site cleft and involved in hydrophobic interactions with the sugar inhibitor. Upon sugar binding it moves and becomes more ordered (Kurachi, Siecker & Jensen, 1976; Perkins, Johnson, Machin & Phillips, 1978; Strynadka & James, 1991; Turner & Howell, 1995). Conformational changes were also observed for residues Pro70--Leu75 (Perkins et al., 1978; Kelly, Sielecki, Sykes, James & Phillips, 1979; Lumb, Cheetham & Dobson, 1994) and the rather flexible nature of this loop was emphasized from calculated simulations using molecular dynamics as well for free and substrate-bound lysozyme (Post et al., 1986; Post, Dobson & Karplus, 1989). However, in the sugar-bound lysozyme structures, the loop Pro70-Leu75 becomes more ordered as noticed for Trp62, and in addition a flip occurs in the peptide bond between Arg73 and Asn74 (relatively to native lysozymes) (Strynadka & James, 1991; Hadfield et al., 1994; Turner & Howell, 1995). The different conformations for residues Pro70-Leu75 in different crystal forms and sources of egg-white lysozyme were abundantly described (Berthou et al., 1983; Turner & Howell, 1995). In the present work, the loop Ser60-Leu75 is perfectly defined into the electrondensity map as well for the ground and space structures. It is not obvious to decide if the conformation of the

other conformation of N(~ is hydrogen bonded to only one water molecule but is involved in an intramolecular salt bridge with the glutamate side chain of Glu7. In the space structure, there is no salt bridge observed at this site, the alternative positions of the N( atom being stabilized by hydrogen bonds with several other water molecules. In the ground structure, the alternative positions of the group C/3, C3", O~1, N62 of Asn59 are stabilized by a number of close contacts involving two water molecules and two protein atoms (03, of Ser50 and Obl of Asp52). In spite of the high resolution of the space structure, the two positions of Asn59 were not clearly observed into the electron-density map 21F,,I-IF~.l, and this residue was modeled with only one conformation. 3.6. Comparison with other egg-white lysozymes Starting from the 6LYT structure, the loop Thr69-Gly71 had to be rebuilt for the ground and space structures. As shown in Fig. 1(a), for the ground and space structures, the peptide bond of this loop is well ordered and defined into the 21F,,I- IFcl map. It is worth pointing out that this region (loop Thr69-Gly71) is located between the residues Ser60, Cys64, Ser72 and Arg73 in contact with the Na ÷. As the density of these residues is very well defined, the presence of Na ÷ may stabilize the loop that becomes more ordered. Near by the loop, a water molecule localized on a twofold axis makes hydrogen bonds with the N atom of the main chain of Gly71 and its symmetry-related atom generated by the binary axis. This water molecule could also play a role in stabilizing the loop conformation especially the residues Pro70-Gly71. No other crystal packing with symmetry-related molecules involving this loop is to be noted. To be mentioned, another water molecule is localized on a binary axis, making hydrogen bonds with the 03, of residue Thr43 and with its symmetry-related atom.

loop is so well defined in the crystal that it could trap the Na ÷ (or water molecule in other structures) or if the presence of Na + sets a specific conformation of the surrounding atoms (loop Ser60--Leu75) and is able to stabilize the loop that becomes more ordered. To try to clarify this point, the high-resolution structures of egg-white lysozyme (resolution better than 2/~) were divided in two classes of conformations for residues Ser60-Leu75 and especially the peptide bond Arg73-Asn74. In a general manner, when a flip occurs for the peptide bond Arg73-Asn74, the CO group of Arg73 is rotated 180 ° on the inside of the loop so that

the 03' of Ser72 moves away from its initial position. This change of conformation allows to capture either an ion or a water molecule. Both form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding atoms of the loop Ser60-Leu75 and sometimes with other water molecules. Among all the structures listed in Table 5 having an atom identified as a water molecule within the loop Ser60-Leu75, only 1HEW structure is a trisaccharide lysozyme complex. Thus, the presence of a water molecule within this loop does not seem characteristic of the occupancy of a bound ligand at the active site. In addition, in the partridge lysozyme structure (Turner & Howell, 1995),

a water molecule at this site was also observed in the trisaccharide-bound lysozyme. Among the 11 lysozyme molecules having the CO group of Arg73 on the inside of the loop, only six of them own a water molecule, or a Na ÷ in our work, into the site. Among these, some of the water molecules (see Table 5) have a sixfold coordination which is similar to the Na ÷ coordination observed in the ground and space structures.
4. Conclusions

References

One chloride and one sodium ion were identified in the electron-density maps of both ground and space structures but of course more ions are expected to ensure the electroneutrality of the crystal. Higher resolution data obtained with the high-brilliance source of ESRF may reveal more ions at the surface of the molecule. It was tempting to relate the better resolution (this work), to the presence of a sodium ion which could stabilize the loop Ser60-Leu75. Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare on an absolute scale the B factors coming from different procedures of refinement. Therefore, we have now produced crystals of tetragonal lysozyme in the absence of any cation (only H ÷ are present) in order to study the conformation of loop Ser60-Leu75. Refinement is in progress (Retailleau, Ri~s-Kautt & Ducruix, 1996). Experiments on protein crystal growth under reduced gravity show that some protein crystals seem to benefit from microgravity. Sometimes, the space-grown crystals are larger and provide a better signal-to-noise ratio with eventually a better resolution for X-ray analysis. As far as tetragonal crystals of HEW lysozyme are concerned, after testing a dozen crystals we have not observed any improvement. Of course this does not preclude any change for the better in other crystallization conditions, for instance at low supersaturation.* We acknowledge K. Fuhrmann, M. Chofflet, and R.
