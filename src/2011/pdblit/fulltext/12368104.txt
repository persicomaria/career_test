Abstract Helicobacter pylori has elaborated a unique set of virulence factors that allow it to colonise the stomach wall. These factors include urease, helicoidal shape, flagella and adhesion molecules. Here we discuss the molecular characteristics and mechanisms of action of the vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, and the neutrophil-activating protein, HP-NAP. Their activities are discussed in terms of tissue alterations, which promote the release of nutrients necessary for the growth and survival of the bacterium in its nutrient-poor ecological niche. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction Helicobacter pylori infects the stomach of more than 50% of the entire human population [1]. Since its isolation and identification [2], this microaerophilic Gram-negative bacterium has been associated with chronic superficial gastritis (inflammation of the gastric mucosa), chronic active gastritis (gastric mucosa inflammation with polymorphonuclear cell infiltration), peptic ulcer disease (gastric and duodenal ulcers), and gastric cancer [3]. To date, a number of virulence factors have been described and well characterised in H. pylori. The molecular mechanisms and involvement in the H. pylori-associated disease processes of two of these virulence factors will be dealt with in this chapter. H. pylori occupies a particular ecological niche consisting of the apical surface of stomach epithelial cells and within the protective mucus layer. This environment has peculiar features, which are worth recalling, to understand the activities of the virulence factors discussed below. To reach this particular site, the bacterium must cross the oral cavity and the oesophageal tract, which are characterised by the presence of hydrolytic enzymes and a neutral pH. Once through the pylorus, the bacterium faces the acidity of the stomach

lumen with values in the pH range 1­4. Such acid conditions promote the denaturation of most proteins and their hydrolysis by gastric proteases. H. pylori can survive these harsh conditions by buffering its internal and surrounding pH via the enzymatic activity of urease with production of ammonia and bicarbonate ions. It is believed that H. pylori rapidly leaves the stomach lumen to enter the mucus layer which covers and protects the mucosa against ulceration due to the gastric fluids. The mucus layer has unique barrier properties and is relatively impermeable even to small molecules. In addition, hydrogen ions can freely diffuse from the apical portion of the mucosal epithelial cells into the gastric lumen, but not vice versa. In contrast, bicarbonate anions (and probably iron and nickel ions which are necessary for H. pylori growth) are poorly permeable. Thus, a pH gradient exists inside the mucus film characterised by slightly acidic values near the apical cell membrane in normal conditions, or by more acid pH if the thickness of the mucus layer is reduced in pathological conditions. H. pylori can enter the mucus because it releases mucus hydrolysing enzymes, it has a helicoidal shape and it is propelled by flagella. These bacteria adhere strongly to the apical cell membrane via adhesins and by inducing a reorganisation of the plasma membrane of the host gastric epithelial cells [4]. In this particular region of the body, the

supply of nutrients, including ions essential for bacterial growth, is very limited. Several H. pylori genes are, therefore, expected to encode for proteins that affect the physiological state of the stomach cells and tissues in order to favour H. pylori growth. Here, we will focus on two such proteins, which are also major virulence factors: the vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and the neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP). 2. Vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) 2.1. Structure and binding to cells The production of a cytotoxin by H. pylori was deduced by the seminal finding that the supernatants of H. pylori isolates induced striking vacuolar degeneration in cultured eukaryotic cells [5]. This effect was subsequently shown to be caused by a secreted protein toxin, thereafter termed VacA [6]. The vacA gene encodes a pro-toxin approximately 140 kDa in mass; both an amino-terminal signal sequence and a carboxy-terminal fragment are proteolitically cleaved during the process of VacA secretion and an ~88-kDa mature toxin is exported [6,7]. Mature toxin molecules are released into the extracellular space, or may be retained on the surface of the bacterium [8]. The single polypeptide forming the mature VacA tends to undergo cleavage at the site of an exposed, protease-sensitive loop into N-terminal 34-kDa (p37) and C-terminal 54-kDa (p58) fragments [9]. These two fragments remain non-covalently associated, and may correspond to distinct structural and functional subunits. VacA is purified from the culture supernatant as an oligomer with a mass >900 kDa [6]. Imaging by deep-etch electron microscopy shows individual VacA oligomers as flower-shaped complexes about 30 nm in diameter (Fig. 1 panel a). These structures are thought to be composed of one or two rings, each made up of six to seven VacA monomers [9,10]. Acidic [11,12] or basic [13] pH solutions disassemble the oligomers into membrane-inserting monomers [14] and are associated with a marked enhancement of VacA cytotoxicity [11,13]. Transfection of HeLa cells with plasmids expressing the amino-terminal 422 amino acids of VacA is sufficient to induce vacuolisation of HeLa cells [15,16]. Small truncations, internal deletions, and several point mutations in the amino-terminal portion of VacA abrogate toxin activity when assessed in transiently transfected cells [17]. Similarly, purified toxin from a mutant Helicobacter strain, carrying a deletion of amino acid residues 6­27, fails to induce cytoplasmic vacuolation, is defective in the capacity to form membrane channels (see below) and inhibits the activity of the wild-type toxin [18]. Taken together, these data suggest that the amino-terminal region of VacA plays a very important role in toxin activity and that the active membraneinserted toxin is an oligomer. The first step of VacA entry into target cells consists of the binding to the plasma membrane. Residues 480 and 700 have

Fig. 1. Structure and activity of VacA. (a) Low-resolution structure of oligomeric VacA: alternate monomers are shaded differently to represent the interaction of the P37 portion of one monomer with the P58 portion of the adjacent monomer. The dotted line represents the loop connecting P58 and P37. (b) Current model of the cellular activities of VacA. The toxin binds to the apical portion of epithelial cells and inserts into the plasma membrane via hydrophobic protein­lipid interactions. This insertion leads to the formation of anion-selective channels of low conductance, which are capable of releasing bicarbonate, chloride and urea from the cell cytosol. Bicarbonate and urea can thus enter the carbon and nitrogen cycles of H. pylori. Eventually, the VacA toxin channel is internalised and changes the anion permeability of late endosomal compartments, with enhancement of the vacuolar ATPase proton pumping activity. In the presence of weak bases, and in particular of the ammonia generated by the H. pylori urease, osmotically active acidotropic ions (NH4+) will accumulate in the endosomes. This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, an essential step in vacuole formation. Somehow, the VacA toxin is also capable of altering cell­cell junctions and of modifying the trans-epithelial electrical resistance, with concomitant increased fluxes of iron and nickel ions and small metabolites from the mucosa to the bacterium, thus providing it with essential nutrients.

been suggested to be especially important for cell linespecific recognition and binding [19]. Although saturable binding of VacA to sensitive cell lines suggests the presence of specific receptor sites, at least three separate proteins have been implicated in toxin recognition [12,20­22]. In addition, cell sensitivity to VacA has been associated with the presence of one or several GPI-anchored

protein(s) [23,24]. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol decreases the amount of VacA internalised into HeLa cells by more than 70%, and cell-bound VacA was found to be associated with rafts, suggesting that VacA may directly associate with cholesterol-rich microdomains [23­25]. 2.2. Cell vacuolation and endocytic pathway alteration VacA induces the formation of membrane-delimited `vacuoles' in intoxicated cells. Membranes of these vacuoles contain both late endosomal and lysosomal markers [26]. Vacuolation depends not only on VacA but also on the presence in the extracellular medium of permeant weak base, such as ammonia [6]. Several cellular enzymes required for vacuole development and maintenance have been identified [27­29]. Vacuoles observed in biopsies of stomach mucosa from H. pylori-infected patients and in HeLa cells in culture contain electron dense material, but are largely devoid of the multivesicular bodies which are characteristic of late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes (LY) [30]. It appears that VacA induces considerable rearrangement of the organisation of LE and LY, with extensive membrane fusion and swelling. These events do not require SNARE proteins, and it has been suggested that the vacuolar limiting membrane results from successive processes of fusion between the internal membranes among themselves and with the limiting membrane of late endosomal compartments [31]. A role for dynamin, a GTPase functioning in intracellular vesicle formation, in VacA-induced vacuolisation was suggested by the finding that a dominant negative mutant of dynamin inhibits cell vacuolisation in transfected cells without affecting VacA binding or internalisation [32]. VacA alters the functions of the late endocytic pathway and LY even in the absence of detectable vacuolation. With no added weak bases, treatment of HeLa cells with VacA results in missorting of lysosomal hydrolases to the extracellular medium, and impairs the degradation of extracellular ligands, such as epidermal growth factor. Both effects may be ascribed to the capacity of VacA to partially neutralise the pH of acidic cellular compartments [33]. VacA-induced alterations in the function of the endocytic pathway also probably account for the capacity of the toxin to interfere with antigen processing by B lymphocytes [34]. The possible impairment of the intracellular endocytic pathway may have cytotoxic implications. In fact, protein degradation is a cellular function essential for the removal of non-functional cell membrane proteins and extracellular ligands and for the consequent re-utilisation of their amino acids. Moreover, the processing of protein antigens by immune antigen-presenting cells takes place mainly inside the antigen-processing compartment, a specialised form of LE/LY compartment, which is capable of fusing with the plasma membrane. The inhibition of antigen processing and presentation by VacA could be part of a strategy of survival for H. pylori, because the depression of antigen processing within antigen-presenting cells of the mucosa could significantly contribute to the long-lasting infection with H. pylori

in the human stomach. Indeed, evidence for a reduced immune response at the level of the stomach mucosa was found [35]. 2.3. Effect on polarised epithelial monolayers and intracellular survival of H. pylori Addition of VacA to various polarised epithelial monolayers in vitro results in a rapid increase in ion conductivity, which can be measured as a drop in trans-epithelial resistance (TER). This appears to be due to modulation of the resistance of cell­cell junctions (the paracellular pathway) [36]. This effect of VacA is not accompanied by either vacuolation or inhibition of epidermal growth factor degradation; TER decrease is not inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and is not influenced by the presence of weak bases, in contrast to the effect of these compounds on vacuolation. Not only ions but also small neutral molecules with a molecular weight <450 kDa (for example, mannitol and sucrose) exhibit increased trans-epithelial diffusion upon VacA treatment. These results indicate that VacA increases the supply of essential nutrients that are necessary for bacterial growth on the mucosa. This action has been proposed to enhance H. pylori growth in the stomach by allowing increased diffusion of nutrients from gastric mucosa into the mucus layer [36]. Recently, VacA was shown to improve the intracellular survival of H. pylori within AGS cells (human gastric cell line derived from an antral adenocarcinoma) [37]. If confirmed, this would represent another major role of VacA, as it emerges that intracellular vacuoles may constitute a reservoir of live H. pylori, one that is difficult to be reached by antibiotics and by inflammatory cells [38]. Moreover, H. pylori strains expressing VacA interrupt phagosome maturation in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and in human macrophage-like cell line THP-1: failure of macrophages to kill bacteria could explain, at least in part, the persistence of H. pylori [39]. 2.4. Biophysical and biochemical activities Studies with planar lipid bilayers showed that VacA forms anion-selective and voltage-dependent channels only at low pH or after low-pH pre-activation [40]. The VacA channel in the membrane is hexameric and assembles with the same functional properties on the plasma membrane of HeLa cells [41]. After binding and pore formation, VacA is slowly internalised by endocytosis, and the toxin anion channel, due to its acid resistance, is expected to permeabilise to anions the endocytic membrane as well. However, the activity of such intracellular anion-specific channels is only expected to be of importance to organelles endowed with the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) proton pump. This pump is electrogenic, i.e. as it acidifies the lumen, it generates a proton gradient that depresses its further activity. The presence of an anion channel should strongly promote the v-ATPase activity, leading to an enhanced accumulation of protons, which in turn would drive the uptake of weak bases that can permeate through the

718

membrane. The relevance of the VacA channel activity to the proton pumping of v-ATPase is supported by the finding that chloride channel defective cells have fewer acidic intracellular organelles. An increased lumenal concentration of anions and cations has been suggested to cause an osmotically driven swelling with generation of vacuoles [42] (Fig. 1 panel b). Accordingly, anion-channel blockers inhibit vacuolation of HeLa cells exposed to VacA [41,43]. Moreover, mutations within the amino-terminal hydrophobic region of VacA, which impair membrane channel formation inhibit vacuolation [44]. Recent evidence that cell vacuolation requires extracellular chloride and is indeed associated with intracellular accumulation of this anion, of NH4+ and of water further support this model [45]. The importance of the anion-channel activity of VacA is also confirmed by the fact that the anion channel blocker NPPB prevents and reverses the VacA-induced decrease of TER of polarised epithelia [41]. Also the VacA-induced apical anion secretion found in rat intestine [46] can be ascribed to its anion-channel activity. Very recently, Debellis et al. [47] were able to monitor pH changes in epithelial cells of the stomach mucosa of frogs and have found that VacA forms an NPPB-sensitive permeation pathway that allows the exit of bicarbonate anions from the cell cytosol. Such anions could contribute to the buffering of the apical domain of the tissue and could enter the carbon cycle of H. pylori. Given the importance of urea in H. pylori metabolism and survival, the finding that urea permeates out of the cell through the VacA channel may be a very relevant one [48], as VacA could contribute to bacterial growth also by inducing the release of urea on the apical domain. The urea permease inhibitor phloretin inhibits urea permeation through the VacA channel and also cell vacuolation and TER decrease in epithelia [48], reinforcing the central role of the VacA channel in its multiple biological effects.

sphingomyelin [53]. Purified recombinant HP-NAP has been produced in Bacillus subtilis to avoid contamination by Escherichia coli LPS. This purified material is chemotactic for human neutrophils and monocytes [51] and induces surface expression of b2-integrins which are necessary for endothelial trans-migration [50], suggesting that HP-NAP plays a role in the accumulation of these cells at the site of infection with H. pylori. HP-NAP is a powerful stimulant of the production of reactive oxygen radicals. HP-NAP acts via a cascade of intracellular activation events (Fig. 2), including increase of cytosolic calcium ion concentration and phosphorylation of proteins, leading to the assembly of functional NADPH oxidase on the neutrophil plasma membrane through a PTX-sensitive pathway involving ERK and p38MAPK [54]. HP-NAP has also been shown to increase the synthesis of tissue factor and the secretion of the inhibitor-2 of the plasminogen activator in mononuclear cells [55]. By inducing the coordinate expression of cell pro-coagulant and antifibrinolytic activities, HP-NAP might favour fibrin deposition and contribute to the inflammatory reaction of gastric mucosa elicited by H. pylori [55]. HP-NAP is also capable of crossing epithelial monolayers and of inducing the activation of the underlying mast cells [56]. These data further support the idea that HP-NAP has an important role in the in vivo triggering and maintaining of the inflammatory events observed during H. pylori infection. Once released from the bacterium, HP-NAP would cross the stomach epithelial layer, reaching the underlying tissue where mast cells reside. The subsequent activation of mast cells by HP-NAP with release of the content of granules and of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is known to recruit monocytes and neutrophils. Thus, HP-NAP can act at different stages of the inflammatory response by activating mast cells with release of proinflammatory molecules able to activate neutrophils and monocytes, and additionally by acting directly on neutrophils and monocytes by promoting their recruitment and activation. The napA gene is highly conserved within 12 different isolates of H. pylori, at variance from vacA, which may indicate a lack of immune selection for diversification of HP-NAP. The atomic structure of HP-NAP shows a ballshaped docecamer formed by four-helix bundled subunits with a hollow central part, similar to the E. coli DNA-binding protein Dps [57]. Dps proteins are a diverse family of bacterial stress proteins that are induced during periods of nutrient limitation. However, unlike Dps, which binds DNA, HPNAP can bind up to 500 atoms of iron per dodecamer. Indeed, HP-NAP was originally thought to be a bacterial ferritin, based on the nucleotide sequence homologies [58]. The nap gene has several A+T-rich regions of dyad symmetry immediately upstream of its start codon, which could function as Fur-regulated promoters for iron regulation. Similar A+Trich regions exist upstream of the H. pylori ferritin pfr gene. All these data indicate that HP-NAP is important for iron uptake by H. pylori. Iron is an essential nutrient for the

3. H. pylori neutrophil-activating protein The infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear inflammatory cells within the H. pylori-infected stomach mucosa is a common finding, and the degree of mucosal damage correlates with neutrophil infiltration. This bacterium induces the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines from the tissue [49]. In addition, one or more protein components present in H. pylori extracts directly attract and activate neutrophils and other inflammatory cells. Among these, a 150-kDa oligomeric protein isolated from H. pylori was found to promote neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells [50]. This protein was designated HP-NAP (H. pylori neutrophil-activating protein) because of its ability to induce neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen radicals [51]. HP-NAP is released in the medium, most likely after cell lysis, and binds to the bacterial surface, where it can act as an adhesin, mediating binding to mucin [52] or to polymorphonuclear leukocyte

Fig. 2. Scheme of the intracellular events involved in HP-NAP activation of human leukocytes. HP-NAP binds to a specific receptor, which is coupled to a trimeric G protein sensitive to pertussis toxin. Binding triggers the entry of calcium via plasma membrane calcium channels and via the activation of channels located on the endoplasmic reticulum, which are opened by IP3, produced by activated phospholipase C. The activated HP-NAP receptor also activates a PI3 kinase, which is inhibited by wortmannin. The rise in the cytosolic calcium concentration and the activity of PI3 kinase leads to phosphorylation of the cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase and to their migration to the plasma membrane, causing enzyme activation with production of superoxide anions. HP-NAP rapidly activates ERK and p38, and this activation is essential for the HP-NAP-induced superoxide anion generation, adhesion and chemotaxis of human neutrophils. Adapted from [42].

growth of most bacteria, including H. pylori. The unique niche inhabited by H. pylori is probably very poor in iron, and H. pylori possesses several mechanisms for iron uptake. These observations suggest that HP-NAP may have a role in iron binding, but recent data from our laboratory reveal that HP-NAP is constitutively expressed under iron-depleted conditions, its expression is not regulated by the presence or absence of iron and that it does not play a part in the metal resistance of H. pylori [59]. An alternative possibility is that HP-NAP has evolved unique properties of a proinflammatory molecule to induce a very moderate state of inflammation, which would promote H. pylori growth by the release of nutrient factors from the inflammed tissue. The comparison of the structure of HP-NAP with those of similar molecules produced by other bacteria shows the unique presence of a cluster of positive charges, which could be involved in the activation of inflammatory cells [57].
