The crystal structure of oligo-1,6-glucosidase (dextrin 6-a-glucanohydroÊ lase, EC 3.2.1.10) from Bacillus cereus ATCC7064 has been re®ned to 2.0 A resolution with an R-factor of 19.6% for 43,328 re¯ections. The ®nal model contains 4646 protein atoms and 221 ordered water molecules Ê with respective root-mean-square deviations of 0.015 A for bond lengths  and of 3.166 for bond angles from the ideal values. The structure consists of three domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 104 and 175 to 480), the subdomain (residues 105 to 174) and the C-terminal domain (residues 481 to 558). The N-terminal domain takes a (b/a)8-barrel structure with additions of an a-helix (Na6H ) between the sixth strand Nb6 and the sixth helix Na6, an a-helix (Na7H ) between the seventh strand Nb7 and the seventh helix Na7 and three a-helices (Na8H , Na8HH and Na8HHH ) between the eighth strand Nb8 and the eighth helix Na8. The subdomain is composed of an a-helix, a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet, and long intervening loops. The C-terminal domain has a b-barrel structure of eight antiparallel b-strands folded in double Greek key motifs, which is distorted in the sixth strand Cb6. Three catalytic residues, Asp199, Glu255 and Asp329, are located at the bottom of a deep cleft formed by the subdomain and a cluster of the two additional a-helices Na8H and Na8HH in the (b/a)8-barrel. The re®ned structure reveals the locations of 21 proline-substitution sites that are expected to be critical to protein thermostabilization from a sequence comparison among three Bacillus oligo-1,6-glucosidases with different thermostability. These sites lie in loops, b-turns and a-helices, in order of frequency, except for Cys515 in the fourth b-strand Cb4 of the C-terminal domain. The residues in b-turns (Lys121, Glu208, Pro257, Glu290, Pro443, Lys457 and Glu487) are all found at their second positions, and those in a-helices (Asn109, Glu175, Thr261 and Ile403) are present at their N1 positions of the ®rst helical turns. Those residues in both secondary structures adopt f and j values favorable for proline substitution. Residues preceding the 21 sites are mostly conserved upon proline occurrence at these 21 sites in more thermostable Bacillus oligo-1,6-glucosidases. These structural features with respect to the 21 sites indicate that the sites in b-turns and a-helices have more essential prerequisites for proline substitution to thermostabilize the protein than those in loops. This well supports the previous ®nding that the replacement at the appropriate positions in b-turns or a-helices is the most effective for protein thermostabilization by proline substitution.

143 32 and residues 111 to 158, due to ¯exibility in their loop-rich structures (Kizaki et al., 1993). The Ê ®nal model re®ned at 2.0 A resolution, however, has a reasonable structure with good stereochemistry, because the ambiguous regions are improved on the basis of continuous and well-de®ned density maps calculated during the re®nement. In the present structure, no cis-proline residue has been observed, and three Cys residues (Cys69, Cys299 and Cys515) are all present without forming any disul®de bridges. A summary of the re®nement statistics is presented in Table 1. The coordinate Ê error is estimated to be 0.20 A from a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952). The Ramachandran plot of main-chain torsion angles f, j (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) for the re®ned structure of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase was drawn with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993; data not shown). Most of the non-glycine and non-proline residues fall into or near energetically preferred regions; 89.6% lie within most favored regions, and a further 9.6% are in the additional allowed regions. Eleven nonglycine residues (Asn58, Asn61, Ser145, Asp156, Val200, Leu210, Lys273, Ala430, Leu486, Tyr550 and Lys558) have positive f values; nine of these residues, except Lys273 and the carboxy-terminal residue Lys558, are located in b-turns. Three of the residues, Asn61, Val200 and Leu210, are found in generously allowed regions, and Ser145 lies outside the allowed regions. Asn61 is located in the type II b-turn that is formed in the center of the loop between the second b-strand Nb2 and the second a-helix Na2 of the N-terminal domain. The amide group of the residue lies between the guanidino groups of Arg17 and Arg419, and makes strong ionic interactions with these residues. Val200 is located in the b-turn formed by the sequence Met198-Asp199-Val200-Ile201 just after the fourth b-strand Nb4. Therefore, the residue next to Asp199, one of the putative catalytic residues, plays an important role in locating Asp199 in the appropriate position of the active site. Leu210 is the fourth residue of the b-turn (Glu207-Glu208Gly209-Leu210) and precedes Pro211. The polypepTable 1. Re®nement statistics

Introduction
Oligo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.10, dextrin 6a-glucanohydrolase) can hydrolyze non-reducing terminal a-1,6-glucosidic bonds of isomaltosaccharides, panose and an a-limit dextrin. Extensive studies of oligo-1,6-glucosidases from Bacillus strains with different growing temperatures have been made to clarify relationships between molecular properties of these enzymes and their thermostability (Suzuki et al., 1987). As a consequence, the proline rule was proposed for protein thermostabilization (Suzuki et al., 1987; Suzuki, 1989). The principle of the rule is that an increase in the frequency of proline occurrence at b-turn and/or in the total number of hydrophobic residues can enhance protein thermostability. The ®rst experimental result to demonstrate the rule was reported by Matthews et al. (1987), showing that the introduction of proline to bacteriophage T4 lysozyme enhances the thermostability of the protein. In their report, replacement of Ala87 at a b-turn with a proline residue decreases the backbone entropy of unfolding. Since then, similar results with respect to proline substitution at a single site have been reported for hen egg lysozyme (Ueda et al., 1993), human lysozyme (Herning et al., 1992), Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI (Ishikawa et al., 1993; Kimura et al., 1992) and Bacillus stearothermophilus neutral protease (Hardy et al., 1993). We have shown that cumulative replacements at nine sites with proline residues result in the additive enhancement in thermostability of oligo-1,6glucosidase from Bacillus cereus ATCC7064 (Watanabe et al., 1994). Those nine sites were selected out of 21 thermostabilizable sites deduced from proline residues of the oligo-1,6-glucosidases from B. cereus ATCC7064, Bacillus coagulans ATCC7050 and Bacillus thermoglucosidasius KP1006 (Watanabe et al., 1990, 1991a, 1994, 1996). Better understanding of the results required more detailed structural information on the 21 sites. The early stage of the crystal structure analysis of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase revealed the overall Ê folding of the polypeptide chain at 3.0 A resolution (Kizaki et al., 1993). Here, we have re®ned the crysÊ tal structure at 2.0 A resolution. On the basis of the re®ned structure, we have analyzed the critical sites with respect to these structural prerequisites for proline substitution.

Results
Quality of the model The ®nal model comprising 558 amino acid residues and 221 ordered water molecules has an Rfactor 19.6% for 43,328 (85.1% complete) re¯ections Ê within the resolution range of 8.0 to 2.0 A. The root-mean-square deviations from the ideal values Ê are 0.015 A for bond lengths and 3.166 for bond Ê angles. The initial model built at 3.0 A resolution had some ambiguity in two regions, residues 20 to

a R-factor (%)  100(ÆjjFoj À jFcjj)/(ÆjFoj), where jFoj and jFcj are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

144 tide chain turns sharply at Leu210. Consequently, this residue seems to be under a strong stress through the conformation of a tight turn. Ser145 is the only residue that is in the disallowed regions. This residue is located in the b-turn (Ala142Ala143-Phe144-Ser145) formed in the loop connecting the two b-strands, Sb1 and Sb2, of the subdomain. The loop projects far into the cleft of the active site from the subdomain with the b-turn located at the entrance of the active site. The amino nitrogen atom of Ser145 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly146 make hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms of Ala142, respectively. The loop has a tight turn conformation at the region between Ala142 and Gly146. As a result, Ser145 may have unfavorable torsion angles. Although this region was ambiguÊ ous in the initial 3.0 A resolution analysis, it is well de®ned in the present analysis. The mean temperature factors of the mainchain atoms and of the side-chain atoms are plotted in Figure 1 as function of sequence numÊ ber. Their average values are 22.9 and 25.1 A2, respectively (Table 1). There are seven regions with Ê average temperature factors above 40 A2: residues 1 to 3 (the N terminus), residues 132 to 135 (the N terminus of the loop between strands Sb1 and Sb2 in the subdomain), residues 214 to 219 (the center of the loop between the fourth strand Nb4 and the fourth helix Na4 in the subdomain), residues 398 to 401 (the N terminus of the loop between helices Na8H and Na8HH in the N-terminal domain), residues 521 to 528 (the C terminus of the loop between strands Cb4 and Cb5, and the N terminus of the ®fth strand Cb5 in the C-terminal domain), residues 536 to 544 (the sixth strand Cb6, the loop between strands Cb6 and Cb7, and the N terminus of the seventh strand Cb7), and residue 558 (the C terminus). The region of residues 111 to 158, which was ambiguous in the former model, appears ¯exible with high temperature factors. Domain structure A diagram emphasizing the secondary structure elements of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase is shown in Figure 2. The secondary structure components are basically the same as those reported previously (Kizaki et al., 1993). Overall structural features are similar to those of a-amylases from Aspergillus oryzae (Matsuura et al., 1984), pig pancreas (Larson et al., 1994; Qian et al., 1993) and Bacillus licheniformis (Machius et al., 1995), and are common to starch hydrolases and related enzymes (Jespersen et al., 1991). The oligo-1,6-glucosidase molecule consists of three domains: the Nterminal domain (residues 1 to 104 and 175 to 480), the subdomain (residues 105 to 174) and the C-terminal domain (residues 481 to 558). The N-terminal domain is sandwiched by the subdomain and the C-terminal domain. The topology of the N-terminal domain is a modi®ed (b/a)8-

barrel or TIM-barrel (Banner et al., 1975). The prominent modi®cations are the insertions of one a-helix (Na6H ) between the sixth strand Nb6 and the sixth helix Na6, one a-helix (Na7H ) between the seventh strand Nb7 and the seventh helix Na7, and three a-helices (Na8H , Na8HH and Na8HHH ) between the eighth strand Nb8 and the eighth helix Na8. The subdomain takes a loop-rich structure containing an a-helix (Sa1) and a threestranded antiparallel b-sheet (Sb1, Sb2 and Sb3), where 50 residues (71%) out of 70 residues constitute loops. The subdomain and the region (residues 386 and 412) including two helices Na8H and Na8HH in the N-terminal domain make the active site cleft much deeper than those of amylases. The temperature factors in Figure 1 and the representation of the structure in Figure 2 show that these regions give a rather ¯exible character to the gate of the cleft. The C-terminal domain has a b-barrel structure of eight antiparallel b-strands folded in double Greek key motifs that is distorted with the isolated sixth b-strand Cb6. The C-terminal domain is far from the active site cleft.

Representations of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase: (a) the view perpendicular to the axis of the (b/a)8-barrel; (b) the view along the axis of the (b/a)8-barrel. a-Helices and b-strands of the N-terminal domain are colored yellow and red; one a-helix and three b-strands of the subdomain green and blue; and b-strands of the C-terminal domain purple, respectively. All drawings of the structure were made with the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

Secondary structures, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges The secondary structure assignment of b-sheets and a-helices was carried out with the program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), and manually modi®ed by inspecting a list of dihedral angles and hydrogen-bond distances calculated with the È program X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987). The result is presented in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows hydrogenbond schemes in the b-sheet structures included in the three domains. There is a single hydrogen bond formed between strands Nb6 and Nb7 and another between strands Sb1 and Sb3, while the other strands are tightly linked to their neighbors with more hydrogen bonds. However, the strand Cb6 is completely independent of the consecutive b-sheets, although it has a b-strand conformation and is a component of the Greek key motif. Residues involved in possible ionic interactions are listed in Table 2. Twenty-®ve salt bridges are formed between side-chains inside the N-terminal (b/a)8-barrel domain, while there are only a few salt bridges in the subdomain and in the C-terminal domain. One intradomain salt bridge serves to anchor the loop Sa1-Sb1 to the strand Sb3 in the subdomain, and two salt bridges connect the N and C-terminal regions of the subdomain. Two salt bridges join the internal loops (the C terminus, and the loop between strands Cb7 and Cb8) and the strands (Cb3 and Cb8), respectively, in the C-terminal domain. However, no hydrogen bond or interdomain salt bridge is found among the three

domains. The subdomain and the C-terminal domain make hydrophobic interactions with the N-terminal domain. Active site From the comparison of the primary structure of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase with those of Aspergillus oryzae, a-amylase and pig pancreatic a-amylase in previous reports (MacGregor & Svensson, 1989; Watanabe et al., 1990), Asp199, Glu255 and Asp329 were deduced to be the catalytic residues for hydrolyzing the non-reducing terminal a-1,6glucosidic linkage of substrates. The oligo-1,6-glucosidase has Asp199 in the loop extended from the strand Nb4, Glu255 at the C terminus of the strand Nb5, and Asp329 in the loop from the strand Nb7 of the N-terminal domain. The three residues are located at the bottom of the cleft formed between the subdomain and the N-terminal domain (Figure 5). This feature is common to (b/a)8-barrel enzymes, including other carbohydrate-converting enzymes (Feller et al., 1994; Holm et al., 1990; Kadziola et al., 1994; Klein & Schulz, 1991; Machius et al., 1995; Qian et al., 1993; Svensson, 1994). The mutation of the putative catalytic residues (Asp199, Glu255 and Asp329) of the oligo-1,6-glucosidase to asparagine or glutamine resulted in a remarkable loss of enzyme activity (unpublished results), which showed that these three residues de®nitely play a role of active site residues in the cleavage action of the a±1,6-glucosidic bond. In addition to the three residues, His103 and His328,

which also are conserved among the a-amylase family, are located around the active site (Figure 5). Among the a-amylase family enzymes, these two residues are predicted to be critical to binding the glycon glucose residue adjacent to the scissile bond in the substrates (Svensson, 1994). The rigid speci®city of oligo-1,6-glucosidases toward the a-1,6-

glucosidic bond is distinct from those of a-amylases, cyclodextrin glucanotransferases and other a-glucosidases that all act on the a-1,4-glucosidic bond. These ®ve equivalent residues are commonly used for the hydrolysis of a-1,6-glucosidic bonds and a-1,4-glucosidic bonds. Thus, the structure of the oligo-1,6-glucosidase should hold other deter-

Discussion
As it is known that proline may play an effective role in thermostabilization of proteins, the physiochemical properties of proline have been made clearer as the result of intensive investigations. Proline can ultimately adopt only a limited conformation because its pyrrolidine ring imposes rigid constraints on N-Ca rotation. This structural peculiarity results in a preference of proline residues for the second sites of b-turns in proteins (Argos & Palau, 1982; Richardson, 1981; Chou & Fasman, 1978). The recent increase in the number of well-re®ned three-dimensional protein structures has revealed the high frequency of proline occurrence in a-helices (Dasgupta & Bell, 1993; Richardson & Richardson, 1988; Yun et al., 1991), especially at N1 positions of their ®rst turns (Dasgupta & Bell, 1993; Richardson & Richardson, 1988). Moreover, it has been reported by a statistical analysis that proline residues in proteins tend to occur in loops, helices and turns, in order of frequency (MacArthur & Thornton, 1991). These structural preferences strongly suggest that proline exerts crucial effects on protein thermostability by controlling protein folding. The proline rule, that the occurrence of proline residue in a protein consistently increases with the rise in protein thermostability, has been proposed from the investigation of the relationship between the thermostability of Bacillus oligo-1,6-glucosidases and the frequency of proline occurrence (Suzuki et al., 1987). The principle of the proline rule essentially re¯ects the properties of proline described above. According to the rule, with the comparison in amino acid sequence among the oligo-1,6-glucosidases from B. cereus ATCC7064, B. coagulans ATCC7050 and B. thermoglucosidasius KP1006, we predicted 21 sites in the B. cereus enzyme to be critical to thermostabilization. These 21 sites can be expected to be the most promising for thermostabilization by cumulative proline substitutions. Therefore the characteristics of these sites were investigated on the basis of the re®ned structure of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase (Figure 6 and Table 3). These sites fall into three structural elements (b-turn, a-helix and loop) with the exception of Cys515 in a b-strand (Table 3). The distribution of the sites is consistent with the statistical data for proline residues (MacArthur & Thornton, 1991). This implies that these sites should have a propensity to proline substitution for thermostabilization of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase. Of these 21 residues, those in b-turns (Lys121, Glu208, Pro257, Glu290, Pro443, Lys457 and Glu487) are all found at their second positions. The residues

minants essential for its substrate speci®city. In spite of some information on enzymes displaying the dual activity toward a-1,4- and a-1,6-glucosidic bonds (Kuriki et al., 1991; Svensson, 1994), the structural basis for the unique speci®city of oligo1,6-glucosidases has not been elucidated.

in a-helices (Asn109, Glu175, Thr261, Ile403) are present at the N1 positions of the ®rst helical turns. The second positions of b-turns and the N1 positions of a-helices are allowed to be replaced by proline residues with few changes of their backbone conformations (Table 3). The proline residues introduced into these sites should stabilize the protein, because their substitutions lose less entropy due to their restricted N-Ca rotations compared to those of other amino acid re-

sidues (Richardson & Richardson, 1988). This entropic effect on protein thermostability was proved by the single proline substitution in phage T4 lysozyme (Matthews et al., 1987). In order to minimize the structural change of a protein by proline substitution, a residue to be replaced for thermostabilization should adopt a conformation suitable for proline. The conformations of 963 trans-proline residues extracted from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank fall into two dis-

tinct clusters of the a-helical and the b-strand regions with the mean (f,j) values of (À61 , À35 ) and (À65 , 150 ), respectively (MacArthur & Thornton, 1991). The mean f value of the proline residues was À63(Æ15) . Most of the 21 critical sites in B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase fall into these two clusters of regions, although Cys515 in the b-strand Cb4 and Lys132, Glu216 and Lys558 in loops adopt f and j values largely deviating from the regions (Table 3). In particular, seven residues in b-turns and four residues in a-helices have f and j values within these two regions; nine of these 11 residues adopt a-helical conformations, while the two residues in the type II b-turns (Glu208 and Pro257) have b-strand conformations. This shows that these sites in b-turns and a-helices can accommodate their backbones to the preferable conformation for proline without any conformational strain.

The conformation of a residue preceding a proline residue in a protein is often affected by the conformation of the proline residue (Hurley et al., 1992; MacArthur & Thornton, 1991). This is partly because the space available to the preceding residue is severely curtailed (Schimmel & Flory, 1968). The residues preceding the 21 sites in B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase are listed in Table 3. All of the preceding residues, except Lys135, Glu207, Thr215 and Asn456, are conserved at the equivalent sites followed by proline in either of the more thermostable oligo-1,6-glucosidases from B. coagulans ATCC7050 and B. thermoglucosidasius KP1006 (Watanabe et al., 1996). Therefore, if any one of the residues at the 21 sites is replaced with proline, the NH and/or CbH2 group of the residue preceding the proline residue has less steric hindrance from the CdH2 group linked to the imide nitrogen atom of the proline residue.

Each surface area was calculated by the method described by Connolly (1983).

150 The re®ned structure of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase reveals most of the 21 sites located on the molecular surface (Figure 6). In general, there is a strong tendency for residues in b-turns to be on the surface of proteins (Richardson, 1981). Residues in the ®rst turns of a-helices are supposed to have the same tendency as those in b-turns because of the similar bend structures. Table 3 shows the solvent-accessible surface areas of the 21 sites calculated by the method of Connolly (1983). The residues in b-turns and a-helices have much larger surface areas, excepting Pro257 and Thr261. Those of the residues in loops are dependent on their locations. For example, Glu136 and Pro331 located in the interior of the molecule are much less exposed to solvent, while Lys132, Glu216 and Glu378 on the surface of the protein molecule have rather large accessible surface areas. Residues in the 21 sites, predominantly Glu or Lys (Table 3), are far more hydrophilic than proline (Fauchere & Pliska, 1983). When any one of the residues is replaced with proline, the hydrophilicity should be decreased around the site. This is of great signi®cance for protein thermostabilization, as pointed out in the proline rule (Suzuki, 1989). The structural characteristics of B. cereus oligo1,6-glucosidase, as shown above, have proved that the majority of the critical 21 sites have at least several prerequisites for proline substitution and that the sites in b-turns and in a-helices play a favorable role in protein thermostabilization. Therefore, it has been expected that multiple proline substitutions at second positions of b-turns and/or at N1 positions of a-helices are the most effective in thermostabilization of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase, but that substitutions in loops cause much less thermostabilization. In practice, nine of the 21 residues (Lys121, Glu208 and Glu290 at second positions of b-turns; Asn109, Glu175 and Thr261 at N1 positions of a-helices; Glu216, Glu270 and Glu378 in loops) were cumulatively substituted with proline, and the effects on thermostability of the protein were examined by the comparison in tm and Átm values among the mutants (tm, the temperature at which the enzyme was 50% inactivated in ten minutes; Átm, the difference between these tm values of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase and of its mutant: Watanabe et al., 1994). The increase in thermostability observed in the mutation of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase by proline replacement was uneven. The increase in Átm due to one additional proline residue ranged from 0.8 to 1.4 deg. C for second positions of b-turns (Lys121, Glu208 and Glu290) and from 0.4 to 1.4 deg. C for N1 positions of a-helices (Asn109, Glu175 and Thr261). These differences could be mainly explained on the basis of the entropy change caused by proline substitution. The contributions of the mutations Lys 3 Pro, Glu 3 Pro and Asn 3 Pro to the backbone entropy of unfolding were estimated to be in the range of À17 to À8 J molÀ1 KÀ1 (Matthews et al., 1987; Nemethy et al., 1966). The resulting increases in the free energy of unfolding ranged from 5.4 to

2.5 kJ molÀ1 with B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase at 45 C and pH 7.0. Among the sites at second positions of b-turns and at N1 positions of a-helices, replacement of Lys121 or Asn109 with proline was the most effective for thermostabilization (Átm  1.4 deg. C). The f,j angles are À66.5 , and À25.8 for Lys121 and À53.0 , and À41.0 for Asn109, that ®t well with two theoretically predicted energy minima for a proline conformation in the polypeptide chain. Their preceding residues, Asn120 and His108, are strictly conserved in three oligo-1,6-glucosidases, as can be seen in the comparison of their amino acid sequence (Figure 3). The larger values of accessible surface areas for Lys121 and Asn109 indicate that both residues are exposed to solvent with a more hydrophilic environment than that of proline (Table 3). From these observations, these two residues appear to have the most advantages in secondary structure, conformation, preceding residue, accessible surface area and hydrophobicity. For proline replacements at positions other than the second position in b-turns and the N1 position in a-helices, the entropy gain might be canceled by the enthalpy increase resulting from other unknown factors. Similar cancellations of the entropy gain presumably happen for proline replacements in loops. In fact, no signi®cant gain was observed in thermostability for mutant oligo-1,6-glucosidases in which proline was introduced into three sites in loops (at Glu216, Átm  0.1 deg. C; at Glu270, À0.3 deg. C; at Glu378, Æ0 C). Moreover, the f,j angles are À123.3 , and 36.6 for Glu216 and À82.0 , À9.7 for Glu378, which are remote from those for the energetically favored regions. The residues Thr215 and Gly269 preceding Glu216 and Glu270, respectively, of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase are not conserved in two other oligo-1,6-glucosidases. These characters of sites in loops are of crucial disadvantage to thermostabilization by proline replacement. At any rate, the accumulation of these effects should re¯ect the enhancement in thermostability by proline substitutions at second positions of b-turns and at N1 positions of a-helices. The re®ned structure of B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase and the experimental evidence on proline substitution by mutation support the proline rule. The present work has demonstrated that the thermal adaptation of a protein is accomplished by cumulating many small stabilization effects on the protein. The proline rule might be applicable to the enhancement in protein thermostability with the proline substitution at N1 positions of the ®rst turns of a-helices as well as at second positions of b-turns.

corresponding gene in Escherichia coli containing the plasmid pBCE4-2, and puri®ed by consecutive processes of column chromatography with DEAE-cellulose, butylToyopearl and hydroxylapatite, The puri®ed protein was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 10 ml of protein solution (40 mg/ml) mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 53% saturated (NH4)2SO4 and 5 mM EDTA in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P62 with cell dimensions Ê Ê a  b  106.1 A, c  120.0 A and one 66 kDa molecule per asymmetric unit. Data collection Two data sets were collected and merged to give the Ê 2.0 A native data set, which was used throughout the present re®nement and structural analysis. Each data collection was carried out using a screenless Weissenberg camera (Sakabe, 1983), as previously (Kizaki et al., 1993), at the BL6A2 station of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan, with the synchrotron radiation source operated at Ê 2.5 GeV and wavelength 1.04 A. Two crystals were mounted with the crystallographic c* and a-axes, respectively, parallel with the crystal rotation axis. In both cases, the oscillation range was 4.5 with an overlap of 0.5 between the adjacent frames. Twenty and 24 frames of diffraction image for the c*-axis and a-axis settings, reÊ spectively, were processed up to 2.0 A resolution and merged to give the whole native data set, using the WEIS program package (Higashi, 1989). The Rmerge and completeness of the ®rst data set were 7.0% and 54.7%, and those of the second were 6.1% and 78.3%. Both data sets were merged and scaled together, to give the native data set with Rmerge of 5.3% and completeness of 92.5%. The statistics of data collection and processing are summarized in Table 4. Refinement of the model The structure of oligo-1,6-glucosidase was previously Ê determined at 3.0 A resolution using the MIR method phased with three heavy-atom derivatives (Kizaki et al., 1993). At that time, the model of the structure was reÈ ®ned with the protocol of the program X-PLOR (Brunger Ê et al., 1987) to an R-factor of 20.8% from 6.0 to 3.0 A resÊ olution. The 3.0 A analysis revealed the folding of the polypeptide with most of the side-chains. However, the structure still had some ambiguity in two regions: residues 20 to 32 in the loop between the ®rst b-strand Nb1 and the following a-helix Na1 in the N-terminal domain, and residues 111 to 158 forming the majority of the subÊ domain. The new 2.0 A data set was used for extension of the resolution and improvement of the structure. The calculations of re®nement were done with the program X-PLOR implemented on a supercompuer CRAY

YMP2E/264. In each step (2jFoj À jFcj) and (jFoj À jFcj) maps were calculated using the X-PLOR protocol, and the ®tting of the structure into the density maps was inspected using the program FRODO (Jones, 1990) implemented on a Silicon Graphics Indigo Elan. First, the previous model was re-re®ned for 13,301 new data Ê (jFoj 5 2s) from 6.0 to 3.0 A resolution, but the re®nement soon converged to an R-factor of 20.1% without any signi®cant improvement. The resolution was exÊ Ê Ê Ê tended stepwise from 3.0 A to 2.5 A, 2.2 A and 2.0 A using 23,594, 33,721 and 42,194 re¯ections, respectively. Ê In each step after the ®rst cycle of 2.5 A re®nement, water molecules were temporarily picked up from both (2jFoj À jFcj) and (jFoj À jFcj) maps contoured at the 3s level when corresponding electron density peaks were positioned within hydrogen-bond distance from the model coordinates, and included in the further re®nement. Upon re®nement, some water molecules were rejected if they move out of hydrogen-bond distance or if Ê they exceeded a B-factor limit of 50 A2. In the course of re®nement, the regions of residues 20 to 32 and residues 111 to 158, which were ambiguous in the previous analysis, were improved on the basis of (2jFoj À jFcj) omit Ê Ê maps calculated at 2.5 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively, which clearly showed reasonable electron densities in the corresponding regions. In the ®nal stage, the strucÊ Ê ture was re®ned in the resolution range 8.0 A to 2.0 A using the successive techniques of slow-cooling re®nement, B-factor re®nement and positional re®nement. The ®nal model comprising the complete polypeptide chain of 558 amino acid residues and 221 ordered full-occupancy water molecules has an R-factor of 19.6% for Ê 43,328 re¯ections (jFoj 5 2s, 85.1% complete) from 8.0 A Ê to 2.0 A resolution. Miscellaneous Main-chain hydrogen bonds were analyzed with the program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983) using an energy cut-off value of À2.9 kJ molÀ1. Schematic drawings were made with the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991). The other handling of the structure was done with the program Quanta. The surface area of the residues was calculated by the method described before (Connolly, 1983). Coordinates will be deposited in the Protein Data Bank at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (Bernstein et al., 1977) and until then are available from the authors upon request.
