Abstract Regulated Ca2+-dependent release of transmitters from synaptic vesicles is an important characteristic of chemical neurotransmission. Synaptotagmins are abundant synaptic vesicle transmembrane proteins that probably function as Ca 2+ sensors. Molecular cloning has identified four different synaptotagmin isoforms in mammals. We report here the cloning and sequencing of a novel isoform of 386 amino acids. Synaptotagmin V is 54% identical in sequence to synaptotagmin I and possesses all the domains that characterise this multigene family. It is expressed at high levels in rat brain, but not in spinal cord or a number of peripheral non-neuronal tissues. Key words: Neurotransmission; Synaptotagmin V; C2 domain; Ca 2+ sensor

1. Introduction
Neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles in presynaptic nerve terminals from which they are released by exocytosis following an influx of Ca 2+ during the action potential [1]. Neurotransmitter release includes the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. The synaptic vesicle membrane is then retrieved by endocytosis and reused for the formation of new synaptic vesicles. Although the steps leading to neurotransmitter release share many processes with constitutive membrane trafficking the regulated Ca2+-evoked release implies the existence of mechanisms that inactivate the fusion machinery until the signal for exocytosis is received [2]. Members of the synaptotagmin gene family are good candidates for fulfilling the role of such a Ca 2÷ sensor [3-7]. Synaptotagmins are abundant intrinsic membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles, with synaptotagmin I being the best characterised member of this gene family. It consists of a short amino-terminal intravesicular domain, a single transmembrane region and a larger cytoplasmic region [4]. The latter contains two internal repeats that are similar to the C2 domains found in several isoforms of protein kinase C, some phospholipases, rabphilin 3A, GTPase activating protein, brain protein Doc2 and the C. elegans protein unc-13 [8-14]. C2 domains confer Ca 2+dependent phospholipid binding to at least some of these proteins. Similarly, purified synaptotagmin I binds Ca 2+ and phospholipids and this binding is mediated through its first C2 domain [5,15,16]. A Ca2+-dependent interaction between synaptotagmin and putative receptors for activated protein kinase C has also been reported [17]. In vitro experiments have shown that synaptotagmin I can bind to at least three additional pro*Corresponding author. Fax: (44) (223) 412282.

teins in a Ca2+-independent manner [18-20]. These are neurexins which are synaptic cell surface receptors that include the receptor for alpha-latrotoxin, syntaxin which is involved in synaptic vesicle fusion and AP2, a protein complex that mediates clathrin assembly into coated pits. The suggestion that synaptotagmin I functions as a Ca 2+ sensor has received direct support from the demonstration that mice carrying an inactivating mutation in the synaptotagmin I gene lack the fast component of Ca2+-evoked neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons [21]. Molecular cloning has identified four separate synaptotagrain isoforms in mammals [4,22-24]. They differ to some extent in their distribution in central and peripheral nervous systems and are characterised by overlapping but distinct functional properties [25]. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the cDNA encoding a fifth rat synaptotagmin isoform which is expressed predominantly in brain.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. cDNA cloning and sequencing A cDNA library designed to be screened by DNA sequencing was constructed as follows. Double-stranded cDNA was prepared from E 17 rat forebrain poly(A)÷ RNA, as described [26]. The cDNA was treated with Klenow DNA polymerase and Mung bean nuclease, size-fractionated and ligated to HinclI-digested, phosphatased pBS+ or pUC18 plasmid vectors. Following transformation by electroporation 19,200 recombinant colonies were picked individually, grown and stored in Corning 25850 96-well round bottom plates. The insert of clone 1D4 from this library was used as a probe to screen a lambda gtl0 cDNA library prepared from adult rat brain. Ten hybridisation-positiveclones were isolated, subcloned into pBS+ and partially sequenced. Cycle sequencing reactions [27] with either forward or reverse fluorescent primers were run on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Full-length sequence was compiled from both strands of the three overlapping cDNA clones 1D4, RB2 and RB8. Trace files from the sequencing machine were converted to Staden format, edited using ted and assembled into a bap database, as described [28]. The EMBL, Swissprot, GSDB and dBEST sequence databases were searched using the BLAST algorithm [29]. A multiple alignment of the five rat synaptotagmin amino acid sequences was built up by eye, based on the optimal alignments of each pair of sequences produced by the Align program [30]. 2.2. RNA blot analysis Central and peripheral tissues were dissected from adult SpragueDawley rats and immediately frozen on dry-ice. Total RNA was prepared using guanidine isothiocyanate and poly(A) selected. Poly(A)÷ RNA (2/zg) was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, hybridised and washed as described [31]. Probes were labelled with [~2p]dCTPby random priming. The synaptotagrnin V probe was prepared from the gel-purified insert of cDNA clone 1D4. The human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was purchased from Clontech. The synaptotagmin I probe was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of rat brain cDNA using oligonucleotide primers RAT1F 5'-GGAGGAAAGAACGCCATTAAC-3' and RAT1R 5'-GGTTCTTGGCTTCCAGAATG-Y. RNA size markers were purchased from GIBCO-

3. Results

197 c D N A library gave one clone (1D4) with significant similarities to synaptotagrnins. Sequencing of 1D4 indicated that it encodes the carboxy-terminal half of the protein. Clone 1D4 was then used as a probe to screen an adult rat brain c D N A library at high-stringency. Screening of 200,000 plaques gave 10 positives. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of overlapping clones RB2 and RB8 is shown in Fig. 1. In-frame termination codons in the 5' and 3' regions of the D N A sequence indicate that it contains the entire coding region. A single open reading frame encodes a protein of 386 amino acids (Figs. 1 and 2). The predicted amino acid sequence and overall structure identify the protein as a novel member of the synaptotagmin family which we designate synaptotagmin V, The regions common to RB2 and RB8 were identical in sequence. However, 1D4 showed a proline to serine substitution at position 182 and lacked the glutamine residue at position 237. The latter change is similar to that observed in the synaptotagmin p65A isoform from the marine ray D. ommata [32]. Synaptotagmins are defined by a characteristic sequence which comprises five distinct regions. These consist of an amino-terminal intravesicular sequence of variable length, a single hydrophobic stretch of 26-28 amino acids, a cytoplasmic spacer region of variable length, the highly conserved C2 domains and a short carboxy-terminal tail. Synaptotagmin V has a single hydrophobic stretch of 28 amino acids near the aminoterminus. This putative transmembrane region is preceded by a stretch of 23 amino acids with little similarity to aminoterminal sequences of rat synaptotagmins 1-IV. The hydrophobic stretch is followed by a 54 amino acid sequence that precedes the two internal repeats that are very similar to the C2 domains found in other synaptotagmins. These are followed by a carboxy-terminal tail of 25 amino acids. The cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin V contains consensus phosphorylation sites for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, casein kinase 1I and proline-dependent protein kinases, consistent with evidence indi -~ cating that synaptotagmin is a phosphoprotein [33-36]. The overall identity of synaptotagmin V to synaptotagmin I is 54%. It is 53% identical to synaptotagmin If, 29% identical to synaptotagmin IIl and 32% identical to synaptotagmin IV. As with other synaptotagmins the similarities are strongest in the C2 domains (Fig. 2). 3.2. Expression o f synaptotagmin V mRNA in rat tissues The distribution of synaptotagmin V m R N A in various tissues from adult rat was analysed by R N A blotting (Fig. 3). A cDNA probe specific for synaptotagrnin V recognised a single transcript band of approximately 1.7 kb in brain. This size is similar to that of the D N A sequence shown in Fig. 1, indicating that we have probably sequenced the full-length cDNA. No specific signal was detected in poly(A)÷ R N A from rat spinal cord, heart, thymus, kidney, adrenal gland, skeletal muscle and spleen. The brain levels of synaptotagmin V m R N A were similar to those of synaptotagmin I m R N A (data not shown).

has the features common to all known members of this gene L~mily. Thus, it possesses a short intravesicular sequence which i, followed by a single hydrophobic putative membrane spanx~ domain. The latter is separated by a 54 amino acid stretch ing f~om the two highly conserved C2 domains which are followed t y a short carboxy-terminal tail. The first C2 domain mediates Ca2+-dependent phospholipid tinding of synaptotagmins I-III, whereas the first C2 domain f synaptotagmin IV is devoid of Ca 2+ and phospholipid bindi~lg activity, possibly because of an aspartate to serine substitut on at position 244 of synaptotagmin IV [25]. Synaptotagmin x has an aspartate at an equivalent position and its sequence i l the first C2 domain is very similar to that of synaptotagmins l.III, including the amino-terminal sequence in the first C2 t omain that has been shown to be essential for Ca2+-dependent l,hospholipid binding [16]. Synaptotagmin V is therefore likely 1 ) be a Ca 2+ and phospholipid binding protein. Knowledge of i s Ca 2+ affinity must await experimental determination. The ~econd C2 domain mediates high-affinity AP2 binding [20]; it ~; also highly conserved between synaptotagmins I-V, suggest~ag that synaptotagmin V may also be an AP2-binding protein. "'he binding of synaptotagmin I to neurexins is mediated ~ r o u g h its carboxy-terminal 34 amino acids [37]. Synaptotagz~ain V shares a portion of this sequence with synaptotagmin I, uggesting that it may also bind to neurexins. Synaptotagmins are synaptic vesicle proteins and are there!ore predominantly expressed in nerve cells. A 1.7 kb band , orresponding to synaptotagmin V m R N A was found to be , xpressed in rat brain, where its relative levels were similar to hose of synaptotagmin I mRNA. It has been shown previously h a t synaptotagmin I and synaptotagmin III mRNAs are more ,bundant in brain than synaptotagmin IV mRNA, with synapotagmin II m R N A being the least abundant [22-24]. No hy~ridisation-positive bands for synaptotagmin V were observed n poly(A) ÷ R N A prepared rat from spinal cord, adrenal gland w a number of peripheral tissues, indicating that synaptotagnin V expression is largely brain-specific. However, by PCR, t synaptotagmin V-specific band could also be obtained from

spinal cord cDNA, as well as from cDNAs prepared from a number of non-neuronal peripheral tissues. This suggests that synaptotagmin V may be expressed more widely, albeit at only very low levels. Similar results have been reported for synaptotagmin III m R N A [23]. By in situ hybridisation on adult rat brain it has been shown that rostral brain regions contain more synaptotagmin I m R N A and caudal regions more synaptotagmin II mRNA, with most nerve cells expressing predominantly one or the other isoform [25]. Synaptotagmin III and IV mRNAs are less abundant and are co-expressed with synaptotagmin ! and II m R N A s in most nerve cells [25]. The cellular distribution of synaptotagmin V m R N A in brain remains to be determined. Mutational studies in C elegans and D. melanogaster have indicated a role for synaptotagmin in neurotransmission [3840]. However, mutant animals still responded to sensory stimuli and exhibited coordinated motor movements, indicating at least some synaptic transmission. This may be explained by the existence of multiple synaptotagmin genes. Thus, two additional synaptotagmin genes have recently been identified in C elegans through genomic sequencing of cosmid clones from chromosome IlI (cosmid F37A4, Accession Number U00032; cosmid F42G9, Accession Number U0005 l). Mice with an inactivating mutation in the synaptotagmin I gene lack the fast component of CaZ+-evoked neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons, indicating that synaptotagmin I functions as the major low-affinity Ca 2÷ sensor in these nerve cells [21]. Other synaptotagmin isoforms may play a similar role in other nerve cell populations. Although the nature of the high-affinity Ca 2+ sensor is unknown it could also be a synaptotagmin. An understanding of the function of synaptotagmin will require knowledge of all isoforms and of the specific roles played by each isoform in neurotransmission. Acknowledgements: We thank Ch.
