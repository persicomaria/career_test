Structure and catalytic mechanism of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP) synthase, an enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid synthesis
Precursors for isoprenoid synthesis are essential in all organisms. These compounds are synthesized by one of two known routes: the well characterized mevalonate pathway or a recently discovered non-mevalonate route which is used in many bacteria and human pathogens. Since the second pathway is both vital and unlike any found in humans, enzymes catalysing reactions along this synthetic route are possible drug targets. The structure of one such enzyme from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus has been solved to high resolution in the presence of substrate and with a substrate analogue. Enzyme co-crystallized with substrate shows only one product, cytosine monophosphate (CMP), in Ê the active site. At the high resolution of the re®nement (1.6 A) the positions and coordination of the magnesium ions in the active site are clearly seen.

1. Introduction
Isoprenoids are a hugely diverse group of molecules found in all organisms and are constructed from just two building blocks: isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Yeast and higher eukaryotes synthesize IPP from acetyl CoA via mevalonate, using a well characterized pathway (Qureshi & Porter, 1981). Only in the last 10 y has it become apparent that many human pathogens (and plant plastids) use an altogether different synthetic route which starts with pyruvate and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate (Rohmer et al., 1993). Among the pathogenic species which use this `non-mevalonate' pathway are Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. There is therefore enormous interest in uncovering the structures of the enzymes along the route for the purpose of drug design. The antibiotic fosmidomycin was discovered long before it was realised that it inhibits an early step in the non-mevalonate pathway (Kuzuyama et al., 1998); this compound is able to cure mice of the rodent malaria parasite P. vinckei (Jomaa et al., 1999). The non-mevalonate pathway is still not completely characterized, but appears to involve seven separate enzymes (Rohdich et al., 2002; Kuzuyama, 2002), several of which have already been crystallized (Richard et al., 2001; Reuter et al., 2002; Yajima et al., 2002). Three independent groups have recently solved the structure of 4-(cytidine-5H -diphospho)-2-Cmethyl-d-erythritol (MECDP) synthase from Escherichia coli (ygbB; Richard et al., 2002; Steinbacher et al., 2002; Kemp et al., 2002), which catalyses the ®fth step in the pathway (Herz et al., 2000; Takagi et al., 2000). These structures show the protein to be a trimer with three active sites shared between adjacent copies of the protein. The enzyme catalyses an intramolecular

attack by a phosphate group on a diphosphate, cytidine monophosphate (CMP) leaving the substrate to yield a cyclic diphosphate (Fig. 1). Substrate soaking into the crystals allowed the substrate and products to be positioned in the active site and some conclusions to be drawn. We have solved the structure of the equivalent protein from Thermus thermophilus HB8, co-crystallized with substrate and with a substrate analogue missing the attacking phosphate group. Ê These structures, re®ned to 1.6 A, show the protein in more detail and give greater insight into the catalytic mechanism, particularly with regard to the metal centres in the protein.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Expression and purification of MECDP synthase

E. coli BL21 (DE3) and B834 (DE3) cells were transformed with the vector pET11b carrying the ygbB gene from T. themophilus HB8 and then grown in LB medium and LeMaster medium with 25 mg mlÀ1 seleno-l-methionine (SeMet), respectively (LeMaster & Richards, 1985; Hendrickson et al., 1990). Cells were grown with shaking at 310 K. IPTG was added to 1 mM ®nal concentration once the culture reached an optical density (at 600 nm) of 0.8. After 3 h of further growth the cells were harvested and stored at 193 K until use. The following procedure, except for the heat treatment, was carried out at 277 K. 14 g of wet cells were suspended in 160 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and then sonicated on ice. The crude extract was then incubated at 343 K for 30 min and centrifuged. Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to the recovered supernatant to a ®nal concentration of 1.4 M. The protein was then applied to a phenyl-Toyopearl (TOSOH) column (5 ml bed volume) and eluted with a linear gradient of elution buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT). The fractions containing MECDP synthase were collected and dialyzed against 20 mM MES pH 5.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. The protein was applied to a Resource-S (Pharmacia) column (6 ml bed volume) and eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride (50±300 mM NaCl, 20 mM MES pH 5.5, 1 mM DTT). The pooled MECDP synthase was diluted with 20 mM MES pH 5.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT buffer. It was then loaded onto a Synchropak CM300 column (4 ml bed volume) and eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride (50±300 mM NaCl with 20 mM MES pH 5.5, 1 mM DTT). The fractions containing MECDP synthase were collected. 13 mg of native MECDP synthase were obtained from 6.0 g of wet cells and 53 mg of MECDP synthase containing SeMet were obtained from 14 g of wet cells.

The reaction was terminated by incubation at 333 K for 5 min. 1 mg of the MECDP synthase being tested was then added, followed by incubation at 310 K. After 60 min incubation, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to thin-layer chromatography on a cellulose gel (Merck). The cellulose plate, developed with a mixture of 2-butanol, acetic acid and water (3:2:2), was exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji®lm), in which the intensity of the photostimulated luminescence (PSL) was proportional to the adsorbed radiation energy on the imaging plate. The amount of CDP-ME2P was determined by the estimation of the PSL of the corresponding spot with a BAS-1500 (Fuji®lm).

Re®nement was completed without using non-crystallographic constraints or restraints. Overall, the trimers in the asymmetric unit are native protein contains a single Ê extremely similar with r.m.s. deviations of 0.23 A over all main-chain atoms. The tertiary structure is methionine (at the N-terminus), siteshown in (b); the threefold axis runs up and down this view. Figures were generated using directed mutations were created by the MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and rendered with Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994). polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to change three leucine residues (41, 81, 120) to methionine. The mutant protein was expressed with selenomethionine in place of methionine and phasing was then achieved by multiplewavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD). In contrast to the crystal form of the E. coli protein described by two separate groups, the T. thermophilus protein (mutant and native) crystallizes with six monomers in the asymmetric unit, arranged as two trimers of closely associated subunits (Fig. 2). The E. coli protein crystallizes in space group I213, the trimer being generated by the crystallographic threefold axis, or in space group P212121 with a trimer in the asymmetric unit. Since building our ®rst model, three groups have reported the crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme (Richard et al., 2002; Figure 3 Sequence alignment of MECDP synthases from a variety of bacteria. Steinbacher et al., 2002; Kemp et al., 2002). Each group noted Highlighted residues indicate intersubunit (yellow) and substrate (red) that the protein shows similar topology to the E. coli YjgF contacts. Although many residues at the subunit interfaces are not protein (PDB code 1qu9) and chorismate mutase (PDB code conserved between the proteins from E. coli and T. thermophilus, the 2chs). MECDP synthase is well conserved among eubacteria, overall structure of the enzymes is very similar. The substrate-binding site similarly shows a number of substantial mutations. The E. coli enzyme is as shown in Fig. 3. The overall shape of the proteins from unique among the sequences shown in not having a positively charged E. coli and T. thermophilus is therefore highly similar, each residue at position 109, close to the ribose ring binding site.

including two -sheets and four -helices (Fig. 2). The larger -sheet has four strands which lie roughly parallel to the threefold axis at the core of the molecule. Richard et al. (2002) collected only low-resolution X-ray data. They describe the protein as a `-barrel' and tentatively identify the electron density running along the narrow hydrophobic channel along the molecular (and crystallographic) threefold symmetry axis in their structure as an isoprenoid-like molecule. Rather than bind together through main-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds between these -sheets, the subunits pack through sidechain interactions. The protein is not therefore a conventional `-barrel'; the edge-to-face packing of the -sheets gives a much narrower central channel than a true barrel. No such channel exists in the thermophilic protein, suggesting tighter binding of the monomers. In the E. coli protein, His5 and Glu149 from each subunit form salt bridges, but other residues lining the channel are apolar. In T. thermophilus MECDP synthase, His5 is replaced by tyrosine and the tyrosine hydroxyl groups form three hydrogen bonds with each other around the molecular symmetry axis. Glu7 and Arg145 form a cyclic salt-bridge network with their symmetry mates, the arginine residues coming close together and ®lling the central space. Some monomer contacts are preserved between the E. coli and T. thermophilus proteins; for example, Arg2 is a highly conserved residue on the ®rst -strand which forms a salt bridge with Asp125 on a neighbouring subunit. Many of the contacts are altered, however. Of eight apolar residues in the mesophilic protein involved in hydrophobic contacts between the -sheets of different monomers, only four have apolar equivalents in the thermophilic protein. Other notable changes include Ile109 in the E. coli protein, which is altered to arginine in the T. thermophilus enzyme. The arginine side chain forms a salt bridge with the well conserved Asp56, which is involved in contacts to the substrate (see later). Since arginine is commonly found at this position, for example in the M. tuberculosis enzyme, it is unlikely to be related to thermostability. While different in detail, the architecture of the E. coli and T. thermophilus proteins is very similar. The latter protein relies less on apolar contacts and more on hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, however, presumably owing to the weaker hydrophobic effect at high temperatures. The very similar quaternary structure of MECDP synthase from E. coli and T. thermophilus suggests that all members of this family form trimers. This is interesting since the ygbB gene is fused to the ygbP gene to encode a single bifunctional polypeptide in a number of bacteria (Herz et al., 2000). ygbP encodes the enzyme MEP cytidylyltransferase, which catalyzes the reaction two steps prior to MECDP synthase. The structure of E. coli MEP cytidylyltransferase has been solved and is found to be a dimer, with substrate interactions with both polypeptide chains (Richard et al., 2001). Perhaps the fused YgbP±YgbB polypeptide forms hexamers. No substrate channelling occurs between the two active sites in these proteins, however, as an intermediate phosphorylation is required to generate the required cyclodiphosphate.
3.2. Active sites

The previously reported structures of E. coli MECDP synthase include those of several crystals into which substrate or analogues have been soaked. These experiments showed the active sites to be three large symmetry-related cavities stretching across two subunits of the trimer (Fig. 4). The binding site stretches from the N-termini of helices A and C in one subunit to the C-termini of strands 4 and 5 on the next. T. thermophilus MECDP synthase was co-crystallized with both substrate, 2-phospho-4-(cytidine-5H -diphospho)-2C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME2P), and its precursor in the pathway, 4-(cytidine-5H -diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME), which lacks the phosphate group involved in nucleophilic attack catalysed by the enzyme. The cytidyl group binds at the loop, linking 4 and helix D to residues Leu100, Pro103, Leu105 and Gly106 (Figs. 2, 3 and 5). These residues are not particularly well conserved with respect to the E. coli sequence, but the mode of binding is very similar, with hydrogen bonding to the cytidyl group through main-chain atoms (Fig. 3). The side chain of Ala131 in the E. coli protein contacts the pyrimidine base, but this residue is changed to Phe, which leads to a shift in the loop just before helix D. Tight substrate binding is indicated by the very well de®ned electron density around both the cytidyl and the ribose ring. The latter is held by Asp56H and Gly58H (prime indicating the neighbouring subunit) which are both extremely well conserved. Asp56 forms an Asx turn, the side-chain carboxyl H atom bonding to the main-chain N atom of Leu59. The strong conservation Figure 4 The van der Waals surface of the protein coloured according to electrostatic potential, red of the glycine suggests its ¯exibility is indicating negative charge and blue positive.

the ribose O atoms, but its catalytic importance is unclear. Lys132 and Thr133 contact the diphosphate group of the substrate (Figs. 5b and 5e). Unexpectedly, electron density for the protein co-crystallized with substrate (CDP-ME2P) shows strong density for CMP but no sign (even at low contour levels) of the other product, MECDP (Fig. 5c). The enzyme has cleaved CMP from the substrate and apparently lost MECDP. A similar result was obtained using CDP-ME. In this case the diphospho group and cytidyl are very well de®ned in the electron density, but the remainder of the ligand in the binding site cannot be detected. This contrasts with the previously described results obtained with the E. coli enzyme. Soaking crystals of E. coli MECDP synthase with substrate gives clear electron density for both products (in the presence of a suitable metal ion) and soaking with CDP-ME allows the entire molecule to be seen in the binding pocket. Since CDPME is slightly unstable, it appears hydrolysis has occurred yielding CDP (see x3.4 below). Unlike the pockets holding the pyrimidine and ribose ring, the residues involved in binding the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol moiety are rather ¯exible. Residues between helix B and helix C, Pro62±Ala71, form a mobile loop which is poorly ordered in the apo E. coli enzyme, but which becomes well ordered in the presence of the reaction products (Steinbacher et al., 2002). The electron density for the T. thermophilus protein shows this region is very well ordered in both apo and ligandbound forms (contoured at 1.5', the electron-density map shows a hole through the ring of Pro66). The apparently more rigid loop does not lead to a slower reaction rate, however, the heat-stable enzyme being signi®cantly faster than the E. coli equivalent at 310 K. Asp63 is highly conserved and forms hydrogen bonds with two phosphate O atoms in the MECDP complex of the E. coli protein (Steinbacher et al., 2002). The main-chain N atoms of His34 and Ser35 (both absolutely conserved residues) hydrogen bond to the MECDP in the active site, pulling the histidine into a position where its side chain can hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of Asp65 by lying over the substrate. In the T. thermophilus enzyme, both apo and liganded with CDP-ME, Asp63 occupies a position close to that of His34 in the MECDP complex of the E. coli protein. His34 is pushed away from the active site and points towards the solvent. Concerted movements of these residues appear alternately to open the pocket and to hold the substrate in place.
3.3. Metal-binding sites

®ed, one being a magnesium bound to the diphosphate. The other metal ion, bonded to Asp8, His10 and His42, they identi®ed as zinc, but do not describe how they did so. Richard et al. (2002) identi®ed only a single metal (at the second site) as a `putative cation', pointing out that the two histidines are unusual ligands for magnesium in proteins and suggest that the metal site represents Mn2+ or even Ni2+ instead, these metals being derived from the E. coli expression system. Rohdich and coworkers have in fact shown that the E. coli enzyme is active in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions (Herz et al., 2000). The orthorhombic crystal form of the E. coli protein was grown in the presence of manganese ions and CDP (Kemp et al., 2002). Using atomic absorption spectroscopy and anomalous dispersion measurements with these crystals, Hunter and coworkers showed the histidine-coordinated metal ion to be zinc and the second metal ion to be manganese. In both our product-bound and CDP-ME-bound structures of the protein we ®nd two metal ion sites. At the high resolution obtained from the tetragonal crystal form, it is possible to re®ne the temperature (B) factor of the individual atoms reliably. This indicates that both metal ions are magnesium, with very similar B factors and peak electron density. While it is unusual to ®nd a magnesium ion coordinated by histidines, it is not unique (for example, the magnesium at the centre of chlorophyll has an axial histidine ligand as well as four pyrrole nitrogen ligands). We refer to the Zn-atom site of Steinbacher et al. (2002) as `site 1' and the site between the  and  phosphate groups as `site 2'. Site 2 has the usual octahedral coordination associated with magnesium, but site 1 does not. These are the same sites found in the T. thermophilus enzyme cocrystallized with CDP-ME; in the presence of CMP, the site 2 magnesium ion moves to a position (site 3) close to that vacated by the -phosphate. Here it shares a coordination water molecule with the invariant site 1

The reaction catalysed by MECDP synthase involves intramolecular attack by the 2-phosphate group on the -phosphate, CMP acting as the leaving group to give the cyclic diphosphate product MECDP. While conceptually simple, this requires a means of overcoming the strong electrostatic repulsion of the phosphate groups, which is the key role played by the essential metal ions found in the structure. Steinbacher et al. (2002) found intact substrate in the active site in the presence of the metal chelator EDTA. In the other structures they describe, two metal sites are identiActa Cryst. (2003).

Replacing any of the residues coordinating the site 1 magnesium ion with phenylalanine abolished activity. Considerable activity is found for the K132L mutant, showing that the interactions of the lysine with both the substrate and the magnesium ions are not essential for catalysis.

metal ion. The  phosphate of the substrate is coordinated by both magnesium ions which hold it in a suitable position for attack by the 2-phosphate group and neutralize its charge. In common with several other bacterial homologues, T. thermophilus MECDP synthase has a lysine residue in place of Thr132. This reaches towards the substrate and coordinates the site 3 Mg2+ ion in the presence of CMP. With CDP in the active site, the lysine hydrogen bonds to the diphosphate, possibly increasing the rate of nucleophilic attack on the -phosphate of the substrate (Fig. 5b). At 310 K, the thermostable enzyme is signi®cantly more active than the E. coli enzyme (data not shown). Four single-site mutants of MECDP synthase were expressed and puri®ed for enzyme assays. Three of these changed the side chains chelating magnesium ions and all three eliminated enzyme activity (Fig. 6). In contrast, mutating Lys132 to leucine gave a reduced but substantial activity.
3.4. Catalytic mechanism

ordered CMP or CDP in the binding site, but no other parts of the substrate. Binding energy derived from interactions with the cytidyl moiety does not appear to be used to drive the reaction, only to lower KS (and KP). Catalysis is achieved through interactions with the metal ions and the mobile ¯ap which orders on substrate binding, holding the 2-C-methyld-erythritol 2-phosphate moiety in a suitable con®guration for the reaction to proceed. Our structures therefore suggests that in vitro the enzyme may be susceptible to product inhibition, though naturally in vivo CMP is constantly converted to CTP. Inhibitor design may be possible by exploiting fully the interaction energy available from the relatively rigid pockets into which the pyrimidine base and ribose ring ®t. The differences found between the CMP-binding sites in the enzymes from E. coli and T. thermophilus also suggest inhibitors can be found which show some speci®city for particular species.

The 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol moiety is absent from the electron-density maps obtained by co-crystallization with both CDP-ME and CDP-ME2P. Herz et al. (2000) have shown that the E. coli enzyme can break down CDP-ME to yield a nonnatural cyclophosphate product and CMP, but we see no evidence of this reaction since CDP is extremely well ordered in the binding site. It is possible that the ME is removed from the analogue by spontaneous hydrolysis, since CDP-ME appears to be slightly unstable in solution (TK, unpublished observation). Even so, the interactions with the 2-C-methyld-erythritol group are clearly rather weaker than those formed with the cytidyl moiety. In order to effect catalysis, the protein must lower the free energy of the transition state. MECDP synthase appears to lower both the entropy and enthalpy of activation by positioning the attacking phosphate appropriately and countering the negative charge around the P atom being attacked. Many enzymes show an apparent preference for catalysing reactions in one direction; the laws of thermodynamics are not violated by this behaviour since the overall rate of catalysis depends on the binding of substrate, as described by the Haldane relationship (Jencks, 1986). For the simple reaction

4. Conclusions
The high-resolution crystal structures of T. thermophilus MECDP synthase in the presence and absence of ligands provide several important insights into the structure and mechanism of the enzyme. Although residues mediating the subunit interactions are not especially well conserved, comparison with the E. coli enzyme shows the overall protein fold and quaternary structure are extremely similar. Unlike Richard et al. (2002), who found an equilibrium of E. coli MECDP synthase monomer and trimer, analytical ultracentrifugation of the thermostable protein showed no detectable trace of monomer. Tighter packing is also implied by the absence of any channel through the centre of the molecule as described by Richard et al. (2002). The catalytic mechanism does not require any substantial movement of the protein, much of the binding site remaining rigidly ®xed in the presence and absence of substrate or product. This probably partly explains the very high activity of the thermostable protein even at 310 K; many enzymes from thermophilic bacteria lose activity at moderate temperatures, becoming too rigid for catalytically necessary movements. The mobile ¯ap of residues 62±71 which contacts the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol moiety is more ordered in the thermophilic enzyme. Unlike the E. coli enzyme, however, binding CDP-ME to the T. thermophilus protein does not show ordered ligand beyond the diphosphate in the electron-density map. It is possible that the 2-phosphate group is needed to tie down the substrate in the magnesium-bound T. thermophilus protein. It is more likely that the CDP-ME is hydrolysed to release CDP, which appears to bind tightly to the enzyme. Tight binding of the substrate is not required for catalysis; in fact, CDP-ME2P is rather unstable and naturally cyclizes to release CDP. MECDP synthase redirects the attacking phosphate to give CMP instead. Our crystal structures demonstrate the enzyme has higher af®nity for CMP than MECDP and this CMP pocket may be a suitable target for drug design.

the overall equilibrium constant Kov between substrate and product is given by the relationship Kov  kf KP X kr KS

If the dissociation constants of both substrate and product (KS and KP) are the same, then Kov is given by the ratio of the initial reaction rates in the forward and backwards directions (kf akr ). If the enzyme binds the product much more tightly than the substrate, it can accelerate the forward reaction more than the reverse, at the possible risk of product inhibition. The structures of T. thermophilus MECDP synthase show very well
