The lactose synthase (LS) enzyme is a 1:1 complex of a catalytic component, b1,4-galactosyltransferse (b4Gal-T1) and a regulatory component, a-lactalbumin (LA), a mammary gland-speci®c protein. LA promotes the binding of glucose (Glc) to b4Gal-T1, thereby altering its sugar acceptor speci®city from N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to glucose, which enables LS to synthesize lactose, the major carbohydrate component of milk. The crystal structures of LS bound with various substrates were solved at Ê 2 A resolution. These structures reveal that upon substrate binding to b4Gal-T1, a large conformational change occurs in the region comprising residues 345 to 365. This repositions His347 in such a way that it can participate in the coordination of a metal ion, and creates a sugar and LA-binding site. At the sugar-acceptor binding site, a hydrophobic N-acetyl group-binding pocket is found, formed by residues Arg359, Phe360 and Ile363. In the Glc-bound structure, this hydrophobic pocket is absent. For the binding of Glc to LS, a reorientation of the Arg359 sidechain occurs, which blocks the hydrophobic pocket and maximizes the interactions with the Glc molecule. Thus, the role of LA is to hold Glc by hydrogen bonding with the O-1 hydroxyl group in the acceptor-binding site on b4Gal-T1, while the N-acetyl group-binding pocket in b4Gal-T1 adjusts to maximize the interactions with the Glc molecule. This study provides details of a structural basis for the partially ordered kinetic mechanism proposed for lactose synthase.

Introduction
Lactose synthase (LS: EC 2.4.1.22) consists of two components: b1,4-galactosyltransferase (b4Gal-T1: EC 2.4.1.90/38) is one in which the catalytic activity resides; the other, a-lactalbumin (LA), modulates the activity of the former. b4Gal-T1 is a widely distributed, Golgi resident, type-II membrane protein ($45 kDa).1 LA, on the other hand, is a mammary gland-speci®c, protein ($14 kDa) that is Ca2-binding expressed, and in large quantities, only during lactation.2 In the presence of Mn2, b4Gal-T1 catalyzes the transfer of the galactosyl residue from UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) to N-acetyl-glucosaAbbreviations used: LS, lactose synthase; LA, a-lactalbumin; b4Gal-T1, b1,4-galactosyltransferase.

mine (GlcNAc) in either its free form or linked to an oligosaccharide. LA modi®es Gal acceptor speci®city of b4Gal-T1 such that it transfers Gal to glucose as well, to synthesize lactose, the ``milk sugar''. In the absence of LA, b4Gal-T1 has low af®nity for Glc, with a Km of $2 M. In the presence of LA, however, the Km for Glc is reduced by 1000-fold, so that its physiological concentrations are adequate for LS activity.3 LA has long been known to share a similarity with lysozyme at both the genetic and protein structure levels.4 Even though these two proteins exhibit close structural similarities, functionally they are quite different. Lysozyme binds and hydrolyzes the b1-4 glycosidic bond in an oligosaccharide, whereas LA does not even bind the oligosaccharide,4 let alone show a catalytic activity. Furthermore, while LA binds to b4Gal-T1 and modulates its sugar acceptor speci®city, lysozyme shows no af®nity for b4Gal-T1.

206 In humans, b1,4-galactosyltransferase (b4Gal-T) consists of a family of seven enzymes, b4Gal-T1 to b4Gal-T7, that have high protein sequence homology.5,6 These enzymes are expressed in different tissues and show differences in the acceptor speci®city. In the presence of Mn2, all these enzymes transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to different sugar acceptors, generating a b1-4 linkage. During lactation, only b4Gal-T1 is expressed in the mammary gland. Besides b4Gal-T1, some other members of this enzyme family do interact with LA but they exhibit properties that are different. For example, b4Gal-T4 does interact with LA but it synthesizes N-acetyl-lactosamine effectively but not lactose.7 b4Gal-T6, which transfers Gal to the Glc residue of glucosylceramide to synthesize lactosylceramide,8 does not interact with LA. Although the crystal structures of both LA9 and the catalytic domain of free b4Gal-T110 have been known for some time, their mode of interaction has not been elucidated. Neither the sugar-acceptor site nor the LA-binding site was clearly identi®ed in the crystal structure of b4Gal-T1.10 For a better knowledge of the interactions between these proteins, which was deemed essential for the understanding of the mechanism of action of lactose synthase, we undertook the crystal structure determination of LS. We solved the LS crystal structure by MAD methods, using Se-methionine contained in the catalytic domain of b4Gal-T1 ($33 kDa) complexed with LA. We studied the crystal structure of LS and those of its ternary complexes with its preferred substrates. These studies revealed a large conformational change in the region comprising residues 345 to 365 of b4Gal-T1 when compared to the crystal structure of b4Gal-T1.10 This conformational change creates the sugar-acceptor and LA-binding sites, and rede®nes the catalytic pocket.

Results and Discussions
Overall structure of LA and b 4Gal-T1 molecules Table 1 lists single crystal parameters and ®nal re®nement statistics on the lactose synthase with various substrates. Two LA and two b4Gal-T1 molecules are present in the asymmetric unit and they are related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. Each LA molecule is bound to one b4Gal-T1 molecule with either one monosaccharide or uridine diphosphate (Figure 1 shows LS with GlcNAc), forming a 1:1 protein complex of LS. The overall structure of the catalytic domain of the b4Gal-T1 in LS is similar to the reported structure for free b4Gal-T1,10 except for the region comprising residues 345 to 365 (Figure 2). In order to distinguish the two conformations, we refer to the previously reported structure of free b4Gal-T1 as conformation I and the structure of b4Gal-T1 found in LS as conformation II. The mean r.m.s. deviation for the corresponding Ca atoms in these two structures in this ¯exible region, residues 345 Ê to 365, of these two structures is 9.8 A with a maxiÊ for Lys352. In contrast, the value for mum of 20 A Ê the rest of the molecule is only 0.6 A. This region in conformation I exists mainly as a loop, whereas in conformation II residues 345 to 358 form a loop, while the remaining residues, 359 to 365, form an a-helix. These changes cause alterations in the structure of the catalytic pocket. In conformation I, Ê this has been de®ned as a deep open pocket, 13 A in diameter.10 In contrast, in conformation II it changes to an extended cleft. Other signi®cant conformational difference involves Gly313 and Trp314. The side-chain of Trp314, which was outside the pocket is inside the pocket in conformation II (Figure 2). These observations are consistent with the inference drawn earlier regarding the presence of a Trp residue at the active site.11 UV inactivation of the enzyme caused by the destruction of a single

The structures of LS complexes with various substrates were then determined Ê at 2.0 A resolutions. LS is a 1:1 complex between bovine b4Gal-T1, residues 130 to 402, and mouse LA. 4F-Glc is 4¯uoro-glucose.

The interaction of LA with b4Gal-T1 is mostly near the acceptor site, away from both the N and C termini of b4Gal-T1.

Trp residues was prevented when UDP-Gal and Mn2 were present.11 In order to exclude the possibility that the in vitro folding used in the current investigations caused the conformational changes, in a separate study we determined the structure of b4Gal-T1, puri®ed from NSO-GT cell lines obtained from ATCC,10 and observed the same structure in LS-complex as that described here. Although the crystal structure of mouse LA per se has not been determined, its structure in the LS complex in the present study is very similar to the published structure of free LA from other species.9 LA has a ¯exible region, residues 105-111, which is

known to be important for b4Gal-T1 binding,12 and adopts a loop or helix conformation, depending upon the pH of the crystallization medium.13 The present study shows that this region of mouse LA adopts a helix conformation when it is bound in LS (Figure 1). Molecular interactions between LA and b 4Gal-T1 molecules The interactions between LA and b4Gal-T1 molecules are primarily hydrophobic (Figure 3). The distances between the possible interacting atoms in the two protein molecules are listed in Table 2. The

It lies on the opposite side of the catalytic pocket and within this region residues 359 to 365 form an a-helix in LS (blue). Secondly, the orientation of the Trp314 side-chain in b4Gal-T1 in LS complex conformation II (blue) is facing towards inside the catalytic pocket, whereas it is towards the outside in conformation I (red).

209 of its substrate and because all of our LS crystals could be grown only in the presence of at least one substrate, we conclude that conformation II is the catalytically active conformation in LS (Figure 4(c)). A conformational transition of the ¯exible region from conformation I to conformation II could expose the LA-binding region on b4Gal-T1. As suggested by the chemical cross-linking experiments (Figure 4(a)), the observed ¯exible region conformation in the present structure is likely to be due to the substrate binding and not due to LAbinding. In fact, in the absence of LA, in the crystal structure of b4Gal-T1 complex with UDP-Gal and Mn2 alone, b4Gal-T1 has a conformation II similar to that observed in the present LS complex (unpublished results). This conclusion is supported by spectroscopic studies, which suggested that upon UDP-Gal and Mn2 binding, b4Gal-T1 undergoes signi®cant conformational changes.16 Although there is no evidence showing conformational changes upon the sugar acceptor binding to b4Gal-T1, cross-linking of LA and b4Gal-T1 in the presence of GlcNAc (Figure 4(a)) suggests that b4Gal-T1 most likely undergoes conformational changes upon GlcNAc binding. Since the conformation of the ¯exible region in the crystal structure of LS ÁUDP ÁMn2 complex is quite similar to that

sugar molecule, and not with the donor substrate, UDP-Gal (see below). These observations substantiate the results of site-directed mutagenesis studies of LA that Ala106, His107, Leu110, Gln117 and Trp118 are important for binding to b4Gal-T1, and Phe31 and His32 are important for Glc binding.14 Also, in the LS complex, a total of Ê 1310 A2 solvent-accessible surface area is buried between the two protein molecules. This corresponds to 20 % and 11 % of the individual solventaccessible area of LA and b4Gal-T1 molecules, respectively. Significance of the two conformational states of b 4Gal-T1 for LA-binding Cross-linking experiments15 have established that b4Gal-T1 binds to LA only in the presence of either sugar acceptors or UDP-GalCMn2 (Figure 4(a)). This strongly suggests that in the absence of these ligands, b4Gal-T1 exists in a form that cannot interact with LA. The crystal structure of free b4Gal-T110 indicates that the ¯exible region that constitutes residues 345-365 buries the LAbinding site. It appears likely that this state represents conformation I of b4Gal-T1 (Figure 4(b)). As b4Gal-T1 interacts with LA only in the presence

The crosslinking experiments were carried out as described by Brew et al.14 Left lane: cross-linking done in the absence of b4Gal-T1 substrates. No higher molecular mass band corresponding to a 1:1 b4Gal-T1 and LA complex is observed. Right two lanes: the cross-linking experiments were carried out in the presence of GlcNAc, and UDP-Gal and MnCl2, respectively. Under these experimental conditions, b4Gal-T1 and LA interact and can be cross-linked, producing a higher molecular mass band corresponding to a 1:1 complex.

210 found in the LSÁ Glc and LS ÁGlcNAc complexes, these changes can be induced either by the donor or by the acceptor substrate molecule. Binding of the sugar acceptor GlcNAc and Glc molecules to LS Since the crystal structure of free b4Gal-T1,10 conformation I, is known only with the UDP complex, the sugar acceptor-binding site could not be inferred clearly from the crystal structure. Therefore, in order to understand the modulation mechanism by LA it was essential to determine the LS synthase crystal structure with Glc and with GlcNAc. In the crystal structure of the LSÁ GlcNAc complex, only one hydrogen bond was found between GlcNAc and LA; the Nd1 atom of His32 of LA forms a hydrogen bond with the O-1 hydroxyl group of the GlcNAc moiety (Figure 5(a)). All the other hydrogen bonds were between the hydroxyl groups of GlcNAc and the b4Gal-T1 in the regions that comprise residues Lys279 to Tyr289, Trp314 to Asp319 and Arg359 to Ile363. Arg359, Phe360, and Ile363, located in the a6 helix of b4Gal-T1, form a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates and fully encloses the N-2 acetyl group of GlcNAc (Figure 5(a)). The N-2 nitrogen atom is hydrogenbonded to the Asp319 side-chain carboxylate oxygen atom; its carbonyl oxygen atom to the Ne nitrogen atom of the Arg359 side-chain, while the methyl group is surrounded by Phe360 and Ile363. There are two LS molecules in the asymmetric unit of the LS ÁGlc complex, each containing a Glc molecule. From the electron density maps, Glc in one of the LS molecules could be identi®ed clearly as being in the b-conformation (b-Glc) (Figure 5(b)). Since the conformation of the other Glc could not be identi®ed unequivocally, it is denoted as a/bGlc. The O-1 and O-2 hydroxyl groups of both Glc molecules in LSÁGlc form a hydrogen bond with the Nd1 nitrogen atom of His32 of LA and the carboxylate group of Asp319 of b4Gal-T1, respectively. In the interaction with Arg359, however, the two Glc molecules differ. The O-1 hydroxyl group of b-Glc is hydrogen-bonded to the NZ nitrogen atom of Arg359 (Figure 5(b)), whereas the O-1 hydroxyl group of a/b-Glc is hydrogen-bonded to Arg359 through a water molecule (Figure 5(c)). The hydrogen-bonding interactions of the remaining hydroxyl groups of the Glc molecule with b4Gal-T1 are similar to those observed for GlcNAc. UDP-Gal and Mn2 binding to the LS molecule In the studies reported by Gatinel et al., although the free b4Gal-T1 crystals were soaked with UDPGal and MnCl2, only the UDP molecule could be located in the crystal structure10 and not Mn2. Since the presence of metal ion is an absolute requirement for UDP-Gal binding as well as for catalysis,17 we determined two crystal structures of LS, both crystals grown in the presence of 17 mM UDP-Gal and MnCl2 (Table 1). In one of the struc-

Crystal Structure of Lactose Synthase

tures, we could locate only UDP (LS ÁUDP) but in the other both UDP and Mn2 could be seen (LS ÁUDP ÁMn2, Figure 6(a)). The detection of UDP and not UDP-Gal in both the crystal structures could be due either to the hydrolysis of UDP-Gal or because Gal moiety is disordered in the crystals. In both the crystal structures, the nucleoside binding to b4Gal-T1 is similar, but the interactions of phosphate groups are quite different. The orientation of the diphosphate group and its interactions with b4Gal-T1 in LS ÁUDP where Mn2 was not detected were, to some extent similar to those in b4Gal-T1 bound with UDP in conformation I.10 However, in the structure in which Mn2 was present (LS Á UDP Á Mn2 ), the diphosphate group interactions with b4Gal-T1 are quite different. The anionic oxygen atoms of the diphosphate group of UDP interact with b4Gal-T1 through the Mn2 and through a hydrogen bond with Trp314 (Figure 6(a)). In the LS ÁUDP ÁMn2 structure, the Mn2 is seen to coordinate with ®ve atoms, two of them are the anionic oxygen atoms of phosphate groups of UDP and the other three are the carboxylate oxygen atom of Asp254, the Ne2 nitrogen atom of H347, and the Sd sulfur atom of Met344 (Figure 6(a)). During re®nement, the coordination distances were not constrained, and they varied from 2.2 to Ê 2.9 A. The involvement of the Sd atom of Met residues in proteins in metal binding is not so common.18 The distance between the Sd atom and Ê Mn2 is 2.9 A, still within the observed coordination distance for the Mn2. Among the b1,4-GalT (galactosyltransferase) family members, His347 is highly conserved whereas Met344 is present only in b4Gal-T1, -T2, -T3 and -T4.5 It has been thought that the sequence D252VD254 is involved in Mn2 binding,19 and that this sequence is conserved in all the b4Gal-T1 family members.19 However, the present crystal structure reveals that only Asp254 is involved in Mn2 binding. It is possible that Asp252 is involved in galactose binding. Although we did not observe the donor galactose sugar in the crystal structure of LS with the UDP ÁMn2, its binding site can be visualized easily to be deep inside the catalytic pocket from the following fact: of the three b-phosphate anionic oxygen atoms, one is coordinated with the Mn2, the second is hydrogen-bonded to Trp314, and the third oxygen atom pointing towards the interior of the pocket is likely to be galactose-bonded. In the pocket, the hydroxyl groups of galactose are expected to form extensive hydrogen bonding with the side-chain carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp252, Glu317, and Asp318. Extension of the present work identi®es galactose in the deep pocket in the crystals of the b4Gal-T1 complex with UDP-Gal ÁMn2 (unpublished results). Previous biochemical studies have shown that there are two metal-binding sites in b4Gal-T1.17,20 The primary one is a high-af®nity site that binds transition metal ions, particularly Mn2, with KD values in the mM range. Ca2 does not bind to this

Figure 5. Molecular interactions involving the acceptor sugars (a) GlcNAc and (b) and (c) Glc in LS. The acceptors are shown in thick black color. (a) The N-acetyl group is being recognized through the residues Arg359, Phe360, and Ile363. These residues are in the ahelix conformation and form a hydrophobic pocket with the arginine guanidine group at the base of the pocket. The arginine side-chain NH atom forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom, while the methyl group is found inside the hydrophobic pocket. (b) In the presence of b-Glc, the O-1 hydroxyl group is exposed to the solvent, and Arg359 reaches out to form a hydrogen bond with it. Because of this, the hydrophobic pocket created by Phe360 and Ile363 gets closed. The absence of the N-acetyl group in Glc is compensated for by the formation of an additional hydrogen bond between the 2-hydroxyl atom to the backbone 314 residue. (c) With a/b-Glc, the O-1 hydroxyl group is partially buried and, hence, Arg359 cannot form a hydrogen bond with the O1 hydroxyl group. Instead, the O-1 and O-2 hydroxyl groups of a/bGlc interact with Arg359 through water molecules. Again, the particular side-chain conformation of arginine and the presence of the water molecule compensate for the lack of N-2 acetyl group in Glc.

site. The second metal-binding site is the low-af®nity site with a KD in the mM range, to which both Mn2 and Ca2 can bind.16 The primary binding site has been suggested to be important for the binding of UDP-Gal as well as for catalysis. The second metal-binding site, when occupied,

enhances the ef®ciency of catalysis and strengthens the acceptor binding.17 Even though we used 17 mM MnCl2 for the crystallization of the LSÁ UDP ÁMn2 complex, we were unable to identify the second metal ion. However, a second metal ion-binding site is possibly located in the loop region between residues 311 to

Figure 6. (a) Stereo view of UDP-Gal Á Mn2 binding to LS. The Mn2 bridges UDP with b4Gal-T1 through ®ve coordinations, of which two are to phosphate anionic oxygen atoms and three to the b4Gal-T1 molecule, Asp254, Met344 and His347. An unusual coordination is seen between Mn2 and the side-chain Sd atom of Met344 (see the text). (b) Stereo view of the possible second metal ion-binding site on b4Gal-T1. In all the crystal structures determined in the present study, a water molecule was found at the center of the loop between residues 311 and 317. This water molecule interacts with two backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms, another water molecule and with the side-chain amino group of Asn356. In the crystal structure of free b4Gal-T110 this water molecule is absent, due to the different backbone conformation of the residues 313 and 314. The water molecule could play an important role in determining the side-chain orientation of Trp314.

317 (Figure 6(b)). This loop is sandwiched between the side-chains of Glu317 and Asn356. The loop in the conformation I of b4Gal-T1 has a different conformation for the residues Gly313 and Trp314 than does the conformation II and no water molecule is found at the center of the loop. Instead, in conformation I a water molecule was found close to the center, but outside the loop, interacting with the peptide backbone of the loop.10 Comparison of these two structures shows that residues Gly313 and Trp314 have undergone torsional changes, in such a way that their peptide backbones have ¯ipped inside-out. Such conformational transition could create enough space at the center of the loop to accommodate a water molecule. It is possible that a metal ion can substitute for the water molecule and bring about the observed conformational change. This change alters the orientation of the

Trp314 side-chain from the exterior to the interior of the catalytic pocket. The side-chain orientation of Trp314 is important for UDP-Gal binding and for that of the sugar acceptor. This view is supported by the observation that b4Gal-T1 binds to a GlcNAc-agarose column better in the presence of Mn2 than in its absence.17 It is possible to propose a model, based on the different crystal structures, for the binding of sugar acceptor and UDP-Gal ÁMn2 to b4Gal-T1 molecule (Figure 7). In this model, the sugar donor, UDPGal, and the sugar acceptor, Glc/GlcNAc, line up in the catalytic pocket where the O-4 hydroxyl group of the sugar acceptor, Glc/GlcNAc, is in the Ê vicinity, 4-5 A away from the C-1 atom of the donor Gal sugar of UDP-Gal. A very similar arrangement of the acceptor and donor sugars has been predicted on the basis of b4Gal-T1 inhibitor

studies.21 A similar acceptor-donor lineup in the catalytic pocket has been proposed for GlcNAc-T.22 Relevance of the two conformational states for the enzyme kinetic pathway The detailed enzyme kinetics studies23,24 on b4Gal-T1 and LS have suggested that during catalysis the b4Gal-T1 ÁMn2 complex is formed ®rst, to which UDP-Gal and sugar acceptor bind sequentially. In the presence of LA, LA and Glc molecules bind synergistically.23 After catalysis, the product lactose and LA molecules dissociate, followed by UDP and Mn2. On the basis of the results of the present and the previous crystal structure10 of b4Gal-T1 in conformation I, we propose a possible structural basis that accounts for the enzyme kinetic mechanism. Binding of free UDP-Gal and Mn2 to b4Gal-T1 is possible only if b4Gal-T1 is in conformation I, as in the free b4Gal-T1 crystal structure10 (Figure 8(a)). This is supported by the fact that, for the elucidation of its structure, Gastinel et al. soaked free b4Gal-T1 crystals with UDP-Gal and MnCl2 to allow the diffusion of UDP-Gal into the molecule that formed a b4Gal-T1ÁUDP complex. In conformation II, the UDP-Gal-binding site is partially blocked by the ¯exible region residues 345 to 365, preventing its binding to b4Gal-T1. In solution, during the binding of UDP-Gal as a ®rst step, the Trp314 of b4Gal-T1 side-chain has to rotate from outside of the catalytic pocket, the orientation observed in conformation I, into the interior and lock UDP-Gal by forming a hydrogen bond with the b-phosphate oxygen atom (Figure 8(b)). The rotary motion can be achieved by torsional adjustment involving the highly conserved Gly313 residue as well as Trp314. Since in conformation II Trp314 side-chain partially blocks the UDP-Galbinding site, UDP-Gal has to bind to b4Gal-T1 prior to this conformational change. Next, the conformation and fold of the ¯exible region of b4Gal-

T1 (residues 345 to 365) changes from conformation I to II. This ¯exible region in conformation I had buried the LA and the acceptor-binding sites. When it adopts conformation II, it exposes the LA and the acceptor-binding sites and it covers the bound UDP-Gal (Figure 8(c)). Also, this conformational change brings His347 close to the Mn2 so that it forms a coordination bond. This coordination is important to bind the Mn2 ion to b4GalT1 and to hold the ¯exible region in conformation II. This conformational change could be induced by the basic residues present in the region R349DKKN353, which are in the vicinity of the anionic phosphate groups of the bound UDP-Gal molecule. At this stage, both LA and acceptor sites are available for binding. Although, before LA molecule binds to b4Gal-T1 in conformation II, a Glc molecule could sterically occupy its monosaccharide-binding site. It cannot by itself bind in the GlcNAc-binding site, since b4Gal-T1 has low af®nity for Glc without LA (see below). If the LA molecule binds ®rst to b4Gal-T1 in conformation II (which is possible), it would hinder the binding of the Glc molecule. Therefore, it is essential that both Glc and LA molecules bind to b4Gal-T1 together in conformation II. In the ®nal step, after Glc and LAbinding, b4Gal-T1 undergoes further conformational changes on the Arg359 side-chain to maximize its interactions with the Glc molecule (see below). After catalysis, LA and the reaction product, lactose, leave. This is followed by the reversal of the conformation of the ¯exible region to conformation I in order to release the UDP and Mn2. It has been shown that in the LS enzymatic activity, GlcNAc can be an acceptor only at lower concentrations (lower than its Km value); at higher concentrations, it acts as a non-competitive inhibitor.23 The structural mechanism proposed would explain this characteristic property also. At higher concentrations, GlcNAc by itself can induce the conformational changes from conformation I to II, prior to UDP-Gal binding to b4Gal-T1. Steric

Figure 8. The intermediate stages of the catalytic activity are illustrated using the surface electrostatic potential of protein molecules. Electrostatic potential is mapped onto the molecular surface from À10kT (red) to 10kT (blue). Based on the crystal structure of LS with the different substrates, conformation I of b4Gal-T1,10 and the kinetic mechanism b4Gal-T122 established the plausible sequential binding of substrates to b4Gal-T1 and the expected conformational transitions are shown. (a) The UDP-Gal molecule and Mn2 bind to b4Gal-T1 in conformation I. In this conformation its catalytic pocket is wide open for the entry of UDP-Gal and Mn2. (b) The Trp314 side-chain changes its orientation (red), from pointing to the outside(conformation I ) to one located inside (white), as in conformation II. In this state, the secondary N of the indole group of Trp314 hydrogen bonds to the b-phosphate anionic oxygen atom, thereby properly orienting the phosphate groups and allowing its conformation to change. (c) The conformational change of the ¯exible region, residues 345 to 365, from conformation I (red) to active state conformation II (blue). This alters the secondary structure of region 358 to 365 from a loop to a-helix. This also creates the sugar acceptor pocket and exposes the LA-binding site. (d) To form the LS complex with the sugar acceptor and to achieve the active state, LA has to bind along with Glc to the UDP-Gal and Mn2 bound b4Gal-T1 (see the text). After step (d), LS is expected to transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to Glc, to synthesize lactose.

conditions preclude the UDP-Gal molecule from binding to the b4Gal-T1 ÁGlcNAc complex, which is in conformation II. This complex is catalytically

a ``dead-end'' state of the molecule, indicative of the non-competitive inhibition of the enzyme at high concentrations of GlcNAc. Similarly, the

Crystal Structure of Lactose Synthase

215 b4Gal-T1 exists as a family of transferases with seven members, b4Gal-T1 to -T7.5,6 Although only b4Gal-T1 is expressed in the mammary gland during lactation, it has been shown that LA does not effectively modulate the acceptor speci®city of several other family members; with b4Gal-T4 it enhances the transfer of Gal to GlcNAc more than to Glc.7 Since the LA-binding residues are present in most of these family members, attempts are being made, based on the present b4Gal-T1 structure, to explain LA-binding to other b4Gal-T family members by sequence homology model building. Such studies are expected to give some insight into the evolutionary relationship that exists among the b4Gal-T family members. It is interesting to note that b4Gal-T6, which transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to glucosylceramide, has N-acetyl binding residues Arg359, Phe360, and Ile363. It is possible, therefore, that the N-acetyl binding pocket is present on b4Gal-T6. In order to transfer Gal to Glc in the b4Gal-T6 reaction, the ceramide group of the acceptor may play a role similar to that of LA in LS.

observed inhibition of LS catalysis at higher concentrations of LA can be explained as follows. The binding of the LA molecule to the active-state b4Gal-T1 molecule in conformation II without a Glc molecule, which forms the b4Gal-T1 ÁUDPGal Á Mn2  ÁLA complex, is also a catalytically dead-end molecule, as Glc cannot bind to this complex for steric reasons. Molecular basis of the modulation of sugar acceptor specificity of b 4Gal-T1 by LA The modulation of the b4Gal-T1 catalytic activity by LA in the LS complex consists of two components: (1) the sugar acceptor preference of b4Gal-T1 for Glc is enhanced 1000-fold; and (2) the preference for a monosacharide acceptor over an oligosaccharide. The latter can be explained on the basis of the molecular interactions between b4GalT1 and LA molecules. Since LA binds at the extended region of the monosacchride-binding site in b4Gal-T1, GlcNAc containing extended sugars, such as GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc are not acceptor substrates for the LS molecule. Thus, LA and extended sugars compete for the same site on the b4Gal-T1 molecule and become competitive inhibitors.24,25 The preference for Glc in LS can be understood from the crystal structures of LS. Even in the absence of the acceptor N-2 acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), the LA ÁGal-T1 ÁUDP-Gal ÁMn2 crystal structure shows a hydrophobic pocket at the sugar acceptor-binding site of b4Gal-T1, which would facilitate the binding of N-2 acetyl group of GlcNAc (Figure 9(a)). In LS ÁGlcNAc this hydrophobic pocket is occupied by the N-2-acetyl group of GlcNAc (Figure 9(b)). If the glucose molecule were to bind to the LS in this form, it can be expected to bind only weakly in the absence of the N-2 acetyl group to ®ll the hydrophobic pocket. But in the crystal structure of the LS ÁGlc complex, this hydrophobic pocket is absent due to the reorientation of the side-chain of Arg359 (Figure 9(c) and (d)). Thus, it seems that the presence or absence of the N-2 acetyl group on the sugar acceptor is being recognized solely by the b4Gal-T1 molecule. The only direct interaction between the LA and Glc molecules in the LS ÁGlc complex is a hydrogen bond between His32 of LA and the O-1 hydroxyl group of Glc (Figure 9(c) and (d)). This hydrogen bond, however, is not speci®c for Glc only, since it is present with GlcNAc (Figure 9(b)). Thus, the role of LA seems to be to block the extended sugar acceptor-binding pocket, while leaving only a monosaccharide-binding site open and to hold the monosaccharide by a hydrogen bond. It appears that while Glc is being held in the acceptor-binding pocket by LA, b4Gal-T1 modulates itself by adjusting the orientation of Arg359 side-chain to maximize its interactions with the Glc molecule. This way, the acceptor speci®city of b4Gal-T1 is broadened to include Glc along with GlcNAc as an acceptor in the LS complex.

Materials and Methods
b 4Gal-T1 and mouse LA expression and purification The catalytic domain of recombinant bovine b4GalT1 from residues, 130 to 402, d129 b4Gal-T1 ($33 kDa),26 and mouse recombinant LA ($14 kDa) were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. We used an S-sulfonation protocol for folding the protein from the inclusion bodies; a method previously used successfully for folding recombinant phospholipase A2.27 Inclusion bodies (100 mg) were dissolved in 10 ml of 5 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gu-HCl) with 0.3 M sodium sul®te at room temperature. To sulfonate all the free thiol groups in the protein molecule, 1 ml of 50 mM S-sulfonating agent, 2-nitro-5-(sulfothio)-benzoate (NTSB), was added to this solution and stirred vigorously. Completion of sulfonation was judged by the color change of the solution from red to pale yellow. The protein solution was then diluted tenfold with water to precipitate the sulfonated protein. The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 g, washed three times by re-suspending in water, followed by centrifugation to remove any remaining sulfonating agent. The sulfonated protein was re-dissolved in 5 M Gu-HCl to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, which has an absorption of 1.9 to 2.0 at 275 nm. The protein solution was diluted tenfold, in 10 ml portions, in a folding solution to give a ®nal concentration of 100 mg/ml, 0.5 M Gu-HCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4  C), 5 mM EDTA, 4 mM cysteamine, 2 mM cystamine. The protein was allowed to fold for 48 hours at 4  C, then dialyzed against three changes of 4 l of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 4 mM cysteamine, 2 mM cystamine at 4  C to remove Gu-HCl. The protein that precipitated during dialysis was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was concentrated. Typically, when 100 mg of sulfonated wild-type d129-b4Gal-T1 is folded in a 1 l folding solution, it yields 3 to 5 mg of active, soluble, and pure protein. The folded active

(a) In the LS ÁUDP ÁMn2 complex, which does not contain any sugar acceptor, the N-acetyl group binding pocket is still present. (b) In the LS-GlcNAc complex, when the GlcNAc molecule is preset the hydrophobic pocket is completely occupied by the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc. In the absence of the N-acetyl group, this pocket will remain empty if Glc were to bind in this site. (c) and (d) In the LS-Glc complex, Glc binds in this region where the side-chain conformation of Arg359 adopts an orientation that closes the hydrophobic pocket.

Crystal Structure of Lactose Synthase b4Gal-T1 was further puri®ed by af®nity chromatography using an LA-agarose column. Unlike b4Gal-T1, the S-sulfonated inclusion bodies of LA remained soluble and were used as such for folding. Guanidine hydrochloride was required neither for solubilization nor for folding of sulfonated protein. The concentration of the dialyzed sulfonated LA solution was adjusted to about l mg/ml by monitoring its absorption at 275 nm (2.4 to 2.6). Calcium chloride has been shown28 to be required for the folding of the recombinant LA. Typically, an equal amount of a 2Â folding solution containing 100 mM sodium borate (pH 8.5), 5 mM calcium chloride, 8 mM reduced glutathione, 4 mM oxidized glutathione was added slowly to the protein solution. The resulting solution was left to fold at room temperature for 48 hours and then dialyzed against 1 mM calcium chloride to remove the buffer and the oxido-shuf¯ing agents. The dialyzed protein solution was centrifuged at 15,000 g to remove any traces of precipitates and then concentrated. The active protein was isolated from the partially folded inactive protein by fractional precipitation at 40-70 % saturated ammonium sulfate. The protein precipitate was dissolved in water and dialyzed extensively against 1 mM calcium chloride, and the resulting protein solution was directly used for crystallization and other studies. Using this method, 60 to 70 % of the starting S-sulfonated LA material was obtained in an active form. Crystallization and data collection Crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop methods, using 20 mg mlÀ1 of b4Gal-T1 and 10 mg mlÀ1 of LA in the presence of a substrate with the precipitant containing 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.6) and 12.5 % (w/v) PEG 4000. The crystals of the complex could be obtained only in the presence of substrates. The concentration of substrates used during the crystallization were 10 mM GlcNAc, 100 mM Glc and UDP-Gal, and 17 mM MnCl2. Complete three-dimensional X-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line X9B, NSLS, BNL, using a Quantum-4 ccd detector. The frames were processed using DENZO.29 For solving the crystal structure of LS, we used Se-met containing b4Gal-T1 to grow LS crystals. The MAD data were collected at three wavelengths, 0.96, 0.98 and Ê Ê 0.99 A, up to 2.5 A resolution. The native data on the other substrate-bound LS crystals were collected using a Ê wavelength of 0.98 A. The data collection statistics are given in Table 1. Structure solution and refinement The structure was solved using MAD methods. Of the Ê 22 Se atoms, 14 were located using SOLVE30 at 2.8 A resolution. Solvent averaging of Fourier maps based on these Se atoms by DM in CCP431 yielded interpretable electron density maps. Although no Se atom is present in the LA molecule, the experimental electron density Â maps at the 1o level clearly showed both LA and b4GalT1 molecules. Based on the experimental electron density maps, the individual crystal structures of the LA and the b4Gal-T1 molecules were used as models to build the LS structure. The crystal structure of rat LA (unpublished results) was ®tted into the electron density map of LA without any change in its conformation. Although the b4Gal-T1 structure10 could be ®tted into the experimental

217
electron density map, a large difference in conformation and fold for residues 313 to 314 and 345 to 365 was observed. Therefore, these regions alone were built independently using the program O.32 The two LS molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. During re®nement, the two LS molecules are restrained by this pseudo 2-fold symmetry. All the re®nements were carried out initially by XPLOR3.85, followed by CNS1.0.33 The coordination distances for Mn2 were not restrained, while the Ca2 coordination distances in LA were restrained. The ®nal re®nement statistics are given in Table 1. All the Figures were drawn using MOLSCRIPT34 and the electrostatic surface diagrams were generated using GRAsp.35 Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates of LSÁ GlcNAc, LSÁ Glc, LS Á UDPÁ Mn and Se-LS Á UDP complexes have been deposited in the RCSB Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 1J92, 1J8W, 1J8X and 1J94.
