INTRODUCTION Cyanobacteria are ancient photosynthetic bacteria ($2.85 billion years old1) that are capable of fixing atmospheric N2 during periods of nitrogen starvation in their growing environment.2 Among the five distinct classes of cyanobacteria, filamentous cyanobacteria such as Nostoc punctiforme strain PCC 73102 form chains of actively dividing vegetative cells capable of carrying out photosynthesis.2 Within 18­24 h after the onset of nitrogen starvation, $10% of vegetative cells, evenly spaced along the filament, differentiate into ``heterocysts,''2,3 specialized cells which have a thick glycolipid-rich cellular wall that helps maintain a microaerobic environment required for function of nitrogenases involved in nitrogen fixation.4 Heterocyst differentiation appears to be regulated by a primitive, yet complex, intercellular regulatory network involving hundreds of genes.5 Several genes have been determined to play a specific role in heterocyst differentiation, including two key transcriptional regulators: nitrogen control protein A (NtcA) that manages global nitrogen uptake,6 and HetR, an autoregulatory DNAbinding protein considered to be a master regulator of heterocyst differentiation.7,8 Heterocyst differentiation is also regulated by PatS, which appears to be an intercellular signaling peptide produced by developing heterocysts to inhibit differentiation of neighboring vegetative

cells.9­11 Certain genes of yet unknown biochemical function have been shown to suppress heterocyst differentiation when overexpressed in wild-type cells, including HetY12 and HetN,13 while overexpression of HetL, a pentapeptide repeat protein whose structure has recently been solved,14 has been shown to stimulate heterocyst differentiation.15 Asr1734 from Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120 (also referred to as Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120) has also recently been reported to be a negative regulator of heterocyst differentiation.16 Asr1734 is a small protein of 93 residues (MW 10.75 kDa) that appears to be an orphan with homologs only in other filamentous cyanobacteria: Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (Npun_R1517, 91% seq. id.), Nodularia spumigena CCY9414 (N9414_00595, 93% seq. id.), and Anabaena variabilis (AvA0302, 100% seq. id.). As a first step toward investigating its biochemical function, we have determined the crystal structure of Npun_R1517 from Nostoc punctiforme ° PCC 73102, at 2.0 A resolution.

Asr1734 and npun_R1517 genes were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of Nostoc sp. PCC7120 and Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102, respectively, using the following primers: 50 -CCCGCCCGCATATGAACTCGAAAG CATTACCACG and 50 -GCCCGCTCGAGCTATTGAT TAGTATCAACAGCATTACG, and cloned into the vector pET28b (Novagen) at Nde I and Xho I sites. The plasmid constructs were transformed into competent cells of the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for overexpression with an N-terminal 6x-histidine including a thrombin cleavage site. The double mutants (R84G/ R86G) for both asr1734 and npun_R1517 were made using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The E. coli clones were grown at 378C with vigorous shaking to an OD600 of $0.8 in 1 L of LB medium supplemented with 30 lg/mL kanomycin. Protein expression was IPTG-induced at 288C overnight. Cells were then harvested and stored at 2808C. Thawed cells were resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer [0.25M NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8]. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of about 0.2 lM immediately prior to cell lysis by three passes through a French Press (SLM Instruments). The cell lysate was spun at 24,000g for 60 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10 mL Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen) and washed with 50 mL of buffer [0.25M NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 30 mM imidazole]. The his-tagged protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA column with 300 mM imidazole in the starting buffer and concentrated with an Amicon Centriprep-10 to a concentration of about 10 mg/mL. The concentrated protein fraction was further analyzed on a Pharmacia Superdex200 HiLoad size exclusion column equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.25M NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8.

Crystallization screening was carried out for Asr1734, Npn_R1517, and double mutants of both proteins; however, crystals were obtained only for Npun_R1517. Crystallization of Npun_R1517 was conducted at $228C using the hanging-drop method. Drops were set up by mixing 1 lL of Npun_1517 (4.5 mg/mL) with 1 lL of each reservoir buffer from the Hampton Research Crystal Screen Cryo kit. Poorly defined crystals appeared in a buffer containing 0.04M KH2PO4, 16% PEG 8000, and 20% glycerol within 24 h. Crystallization conditions were optimized around this buffer by varying the concentrations of protein and buffer components, in addition to adjusting the pH. Well-defined crystals formed within 3­4 h at $228C in a 0.020M sodium HEPES buffer with 20% glycerol at pH

7.5. The drops were set up by combining 2 lL of Npun_1517 (9.9 mg/mL) with 2 lL of buffer. Npun_R1517 crystals were screened and characterized using Cu Ka radiation from a Bruker Microstar rotating anode generator equipped with Montel optics and a SMART 6000 CCD. A sulfur SAD data set was collected on the same system using a flash-cooled crystal at 100 K with an exposure time of 5 s and an oscillation angle of 0.28 per image. Full data collection statistics are listed in Table I. The data were integrated using the Proteum software package17 and scaled using SADABS.18 XPREP19 was used to calculate data statistics and output anomalous differences.

° lected out to 2.7 A resolution using 300 trials; however, only three sites turned out to be sulfur atoms in the protein, as discussed in the ``Results and Discussion'' section. The substructure was input into SHELXE21 for phase ° determination and improvement to 2.0 A without further refinement of the atomic positions or occupancies. A new autotracing feature under development in SHELXE was used to determine an initial model for the protein backbone. The program uses an iterative method combining density modification with partial structure information to improve phases and produce a model containing the positions of the main-chain atoms. Using this feature, SHELXE was able to determine the positions of 75 residues in $20 min. The densities for most of the side-chain atoms were visible in the corresponding electron density map and were built in prior to refinement. Remaining model building was done manually using Xtalview/Xfit22 and the final structures were refined using CNS23 and REFMAC (5.2.0019).24 The resolution ° cutoff for final structure refinement was fixed at 2.0 A where the completeness in the highest resolution shell exceeded 90%. The structure quality was assessed using Procheck25 and Molprobity.26 The Molprobity analysis output was included in the final structure file submitted to the Protein Data Bank.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Native Npun_R1517 formed diamond-shaped crystals (dimensions in the order of 50 3 100 3 150 lm3) that ° diffracted to about 2.0 A resolution. Indexing showed that the crystals were tetragonal (space group: P43212; ° ° unit-cell dimensions: a 5 b 5 56.336 A, c 5 56.491 A, and a 5 b 5 g 5 908) and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction measurements were made using native protein crystals and phased from highly redundant sulfur anomalous scattering data using the program SHELXD,20 as described in the ``Methods'' section. SHELXD found six potential heavy atom sites with CC(all) 5 30.31 and CC(weak) 5 17.27; however, only the top three sites with site occupancies of >0.8 turned out to be sulfur sites in the protein, including M78-Sd (1.0), C20-Sg (0.93), and M83-Sd (0.80). The structure quality was evaluated using Procheck25 and Molprobity.26 Procheck analysis indicated 98.6% of residues in the most favored region with no residues in the generously allowed or disallowed regions, and G-factors of 20.05, 0.36, and 0.1 for dihedral angles, main chain bond lengths and angles, and overall average, respectively. Molprobity analysis of all atom contacts yielded a clash score of 4.86 (98th percentile) and a protein geometry Molprobity score of 1.83 (85th percentile). Correlation coefficients for (Fo 2 Fc) and (Fo 2 Fc)free, calculated after refinement using REFMAC (v5.2.0019),24 were 0.95

and 0.93, respectively. Structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Npun_R1517 adopts a sleigh-shaped structure [Fig. 1(A)] with a two-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (b1: V15-E30, b2: L57-Q67) forming the floor of the sleigh, a 3­10 helix-turn-helix (3­10a1: K32-L34, a2: R38-E51) forming the seat, and a 3­10helix-turn-helix (3­10a3: E71L73, a4: Q77-R86) forming the front of the sleigh. Monomeric Npun_R1517, which constitutes the crystallographic asymmetric unit, is poorly packed alone with a large gap between a2 and a3 [Fig. 1(A)]. In the crystal, however, two symmetry-related Npun_R1517 molecules form an extensively interlocked dimer (the symmetryrelated molecule is generated by the P43212 symmetry operation y 2 1, x 1 1, 2z) that is well packed [Fig. 1(B,C)] and appears to be the functional biological assembly. The interlocking dimer is stabilized by a

(B) The electrostatic potential surface of Npun_R1517 looking down onto the four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet.

two-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet between the b1 strand of one chain and b10 strand of the symmetry-related chain with hydrogen bonds between residues AF26:BC20, AL24:BI22, AI22:BL24, and AC20:BF26. Because of the symmetry rotation, one sleigh-shaped molecule faces forward, and the direction of the second molecule is reversed. Consequently, when the two molecules form the interlocked dimer, the seat of one molecule (the 3­10a1a2 motif) fills in the gap between the seat and the front of the second molecule [Fig. 1(B,C)]. The interlocked dimer is further stabilized by a hydrophobic core formed among side chains of hydrophobic amino acids from a2 from one chain and b1 and b2 strands of both chains [Fig. 1(C)]. The hydrophobic core appears to stabilize both the dimer interface and the a2 helix, since a2 becomes distorted where it does not sit over the b-sheet [Fig. 1(B)]. The interlocked dimer forms a rectangular ° box-shaped structure with dimensions of $50 A from a4 ° from the sleigh on one chain to a4 on the other, $11 A floor to the top of the a2 helices sitting atop the b-sheet, ° and $14 A wide across the sheet from b2 on one chain to b2 on the other chain. A Protorp (www.bioinformatics. sussex.ac.uk/protorp/) analysis of the homodimer interface indicated an extensively interlocked structure with ° an interface surface area of 2279 A2 (where the mean for all homodimers is 1517 Æ 1304) involving 303 atoms

(mean is 130 Æ 110) and involving 24 hydrogen bonds and 44 salt bridges (www.bioinformatics.sussex.ac.uk/ protorp/). Wu et al.16 reported that the double mutant (R84G and R86G) of Asr1734 was defective for heterocyst inhibition. Asr1734 and Npun_R1517 have 91% sequence identity and are conserved in the C-terminal helix containing R84 and R86. The Npun_R1517 structure reveals the precise location of these residues, which sit on a highly positively charged C-terminal a-helix, a4 [Fig. 2(A)]. We found that the R84G, R86G double mutant of Npun_R1517 was susceptible to severe aggregation, which prevented crystallization and might explain the lack of function of the double mutant of Asr1734. The Npun_R1517 protein dimer structure was submitted to ProFunc27 in an attempt to gain some insight into its function. The results were mostly negative; however, one certain hit was the presence of a RL-class nest, a three-residue sequence in a particular conformation that is commonly found in anion binding sites,28 corresponding to residues E51-G52-S53. The nest is adjacent to a deep cavity in the protein that contains a surface exposed hydrophobic side chain of L57. The Npun_R1517 surface also contains a deep cleft between the a2 helices of the two chains [Fig. 2(A)]. Finally, the surface electrostatic charge potential of Npun_R1517 is

uniformly negative on the face containing the a2 helices, except for the a4 helices which are positively charged [Fig. 2(A)]. In contrast, the surface for the b-sheet face of Npun_R1517 is evenly distributed with positive and negative charge potentials [Fig. 2(B)]. In summary, based on its lack of sequence homologs in other non­heterocyst-forming organisms, its lack of recognizable functional motifs, and its lack of similar structures in the protein data bank, it appears that Npun_R1517 is encoded by an orphan gene29 with an important biological function in Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102. The structure of Npun_R1517 adopts a novel fold consisting of an extensively interlocked homodimer that appears to be the functional biological assembly. The structure exhibits an interesting pattern of electrostatic charge potentials, clefts and cavities on its surface, including a nest motif. Biochemical studies of Npun_R1517 are underway to enable a more complete understanding of its precise biochemical function.
