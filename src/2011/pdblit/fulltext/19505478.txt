SUMMARY

Nucleoporin (Nup) 153 is a highly mobile, multifunctional, and essential nuclear pore protein. It contains four zinc finger motifs that are thought to be crucial for the regulation of transport-receptor/cargo interactions via their binding to the small guanine nucleotide binding protein, Ran. We found this interaction to be independent of the phoshorylation state of the nucleotide. Ran binds with the highest affinity to the second zinc finger motif of Nup153 (Nup153ZnF2). Here we present the crystal structure of this complex, revealing a new type of Ran-Ran interaction partner interface together with the solution structure of Nup153ZnF2. According to our complex structure, Nup153ZnF2 binding to Ran excludes the formation of a Ran-importin-b complex. This finding suggests a local Nup153-mediated Ran reservoir at the nucleoplasmic distal ring of the nuclear pore, where nucleotide exchange may take place in a ternary Nup153Ran-RCC1 complex, so that import complexes are efficiently terminated.
INTRODUCTION In eukaryotes, nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs exclusively through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that are composed of multiple copies of 30 differerent nucleoporins (Nups) and reach up to 120 MDa. The transport through the NPCs is orchestrated by the small guanine nucleotide binding protein, Ran. Ran is localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, but both populations differ in the phoshorylation state of the bound nucleotide. The GDP-bound form is predominantly found in the cytoplasm, whereas, inside the nucleus, GTP is bound to the protein. This asymmetric distribution of Ran has been shown to determine the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport (Kalab et al., 2006). During transport cycles, Ran shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, while the compartmentalization of Ran regulator proteins maintains the RanGTP gradient: RanGAP, as Ran guanine nucleotide activating protein, is localized at the cytoplasmic

part of the NPC, and the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange protein RCC1 (RanGEF) resides in the nucleus. In nuclear import, an importin-b/cargo complex can translocate through the NPC via specific interactions of importinb with so called phenylalanin-glycine (FG) repeats that fill the inner pore channel, and are crucial for normal nuclear transport (Bayliss et al., 2000; Rexach and Blobel, 1995; Stewart, 2007). Those FG repeats (mainly FxFG or GLFG motifs) are contained in flexible, self-interacting loops contributed by Nups surrounding the inner channel, and constitute the selective hydrophobic ¨ barrier of the NPC (Frey and Gorlich, 2007; Frey et al., 2006). After passage through the NPC, nuclear RanGTP binds to importin-b and thereby releases the cargo protein from the transport complex. Subsequently, the RanGTP-importin-b complex can again pass through the NPC to the cytoplasm to recycle importin-b. In higher eukaryotes, this complex is assumed to be terminated by the hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP at the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC by the action of the RanGAP containing protein RanBP2. This is the energy-consuming step in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Nuclear export processes are initialized by complex formation of cargo-nuclear export signal, an export receptor, and RanGTP. Again, after passage through the NPC, RanGTP is hydrolyzed, and the export complex dissolves. Subsequently, exportins can shuffle back into the nucleus by themselves. The multifunctional 153 kDa Nup153 belongs to the class of FG repeat proteins, and is involved in different cellular processes besides participating in the formation of NPCs: mammalian Nup153 plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Ball and Ullman, 2005; Denning et al., 2003; Prunuske et al., 2006). The protein also directly interacts with lamin B, a protein of the nuclear lamina, and was thus suggested to be involved in the anchoring of NPCs to the nuclear lamina. Nup153 lacks an ortholog in yeast, and is a tripartite protein with a unique N-terminal part that contains a nuclear envelope targeting cassette, a nuclear pore associating region, and an RNA binding domain (Ball and Ullman, 2005). The central part harbors four C2-C2 zinc finger motifs that share the highest similarity with zinc fingers of Nup358 (RanBP2). Together, those domains of Nup153 and RanBP2 define the so-called RanBP2-type zinc finger class that is unique with respect to the repetitive arrangement of four to eight zinc fingers, and also shares conserved,

nonstructural residues (Higa et al., 2007). The C-terminal domain of Nup153 is composed of FxFG repeats (Wu et al., 1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995). Initial immuno-EM-based studies revealed a predominant localization of Nup153 to the nuclear basket (Sukegawa and Blobel, 1993). Subsequently, more detailed studies showed that the different domains of Nup153 are localized to different parts of the NPC (Fahrenkrog et al., 2002; Krull et al., 2004; Pante et al., 1994, 2000; Walther et al., 2001). The central zinc finger region turned out to be highly accessible at the distal ring of the nuclear basket structure of the NPC. Recently, the entire picture became even more complex, as a distinct population of Nup153 has been found to be highly mobile and associated with the NPC for very short periods of time (in the order of seconds) (Rabut et al., 2004). This makes Nup153 the most dynamic of all Nups, and places it in strong contrast to a group of immobile Nups that stay integrated in the NPC for up to 70 hr, and are thought to represent the structural backbone of the complex (Rabut et al., 2004). However, a second population of Nup153 was found to be less mobile and resides at the NPC for up to 13 min (Rabut et al., 2004). In numerous studies, Nup153 has been found to interact with a variety of molecules, including importin-b and -a2, Ran, transportin-1, exportin-1 (Crm1), Kapb3 (RanBP5), and NTF2 of the protein transport machinery, exportin-t and -5, NXF1/TAP and eIF5A of the RNA transport system, the Nup160 complex and Tpr in the NPC, as well as RNA and DNA (reviewed by Ball and Ullman, 2005). Even specific protein-protein interactions of Nup153, like the Ran-Nup153 interaction that is analyzed here, might be of a multifunctional nature; besides, in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a Ran-Nup153 complex might be functionally important in mitosis, since it is known that Nup153 is recruited to the NPC early during NE formation (Rabut et al., 2004), where Ran also plays a crucial role (Walther et al., 2003). In summary, these findings render Nup153 a key player in various nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways, as well as in basic cellular functions, such as mitosis and apoptosis. Structural information of Nups and Nup complexes is still very limited to date, with only approximately 15% of the NPCs characterized on the atomic level (Berke et al., 2004; Hodel et al., 2002; Melcak et al., 2007; Schrader et al., 2008; Vetter et al., 1999b; Weirich et al., 2004). Nevertheless, a recent study reports the NMR structure of the second zinc finger of Nup153 (Higa et al., 2007), and reveals a so-called LVA motif to be crucial for Ran binding. The binding affinities (KD values) were determined to be in the range of 5­40 mM for both phosphorylation states of the bound nucleotide. However, the details of the complex interface remained unknown. In this study, we report the crystal structure of the Ran-Nup153ZnF2 complex along with the NMR solution structure of Nup153ZnF2, which characterizes this essential complex at the atomic level. RESULTS Preparation of the RanGDP-Nup153ZnF2 Complex The Nup153-ZnF2 construct used in this work (residues 703­ 754) was initially identified as minimal Ran binding motif of Nup153 (Rattus norvegicus) in yeast two-hybrid studies (data not shown) and shares a high degree of sequence conservation

with the other three zinc fingers of Nup153 (Figure 1A). The overall affinity of Ran for ZnF2 appeared to be rather high, as the complex was stable during size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 1B). After binding of RanGDP to ZnF2, the complex was crystallized under stoichiometric conditions in space group ° I222. The phases for the native 2.1 A dataset were obtained by molecular replacement with RanGDP as the search model (for details, see the Experimental Procedures and Table 1). The Crystal Structure of the RanGDP-Nup153ZnF2 Complex The asymmetric unit contained one RanGDP and one Nup153ZnF2 molecule (Figure 1C, RanGDP in gold, ZnF2 in gray) corre° sponding to a Matthews coefficient of 2.7 A3/Da and a solvent content of 54%, respectively. The Ran Moiety The nucleotide binding pocket of Ran, as well as the switch I and II regions, remain structurally unaffected upon interaction with the zinc finger. This becomes apparent by a superposition of our RanGDP-Nup153ZnF2 complex with two uncomplexed RanGDP structures (PDB ID: 1byu, Stewart et al., 1998, and RanGDP, Scheffzek et al., 1995, which was used as MR search ° ° model in this study) resulting in rmsd values of 0.61 A and 0.41 A, respectively (data not shown). Thus, upon binding to the second zinc finger of Nup153, Ran displays no major conformational rearrangements. The ZnF2 Moiety The overall fold of the Nup153ZnF2 peptide in the final complex model, as well as in the NMR structures (Figure 2), consists of two orthogonal b hairpins coordinating the central zinc atom in a small hydrophobic core. Each loop carries two cysteine residues that, together, chelate the metal ion. X-ray data obtained at the zinc K edge corroborated that the bound metal ion is indeed zinc, via its anomalous signal (data not shown). The observed general fold was described previously for members of the RanBP2 and NZF (Np14 zinc fingers) zinc finger families (Alam et al., 2004; Plambeck et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2006) and, very recently, two NMR structures of Nup153ZnF2 became available (Higa et al., 2007; PDB ID: 2ebq and reference therein). The constructs used for those studies differed from the ZnF2 used in this study, so we determined the NMR structure of our construct in order to compare it to the X-ray structure. In complex with Ran, the core of ZnF2 shows a very similar fold to that determined in solution, which is highlighted by a superposition of the crystal structure with the three available NMR structures (Figures 2A and 2B). This structural comparison reveals an almost identical fold for the central zinc coordinating loops (residues 723­749 of Nup153), resulting in ° rmsd values of 0.7 A for the first NMR structure (Higa et al., ° 2007), 0.6 A for the second NMR structure (PDB ID: 2ebq and ° reference therein), and 1.4 A for the NMR structure determined in this study. Toward the N terminus, all structures differ significantly, and, upon binding to Ran, residues 714­722--which are flexible in solution, as shown by our NMR spectroscopy experiments--acquire a fixed conformation and pack against Ran, thus extending the binding interface (see below). Hereby, Phe714 and Phe718 act as key residues, since they are

interacting extensively with a hydrophobic pocket of Ran (Figures 1C, 3A, and 4B) and, indeed, contribute to the binding affinity, as proven by NMR titration experiments (see below) (Figure 4D). The proteins used for the studies of Higa et al. (2007) and those referenced with PDB ID 2ebq, did not contain those phenylalanines, so it was necessary to repeat the NMR experiments with the zinc finger sequence corresponding to our X-ray structure (see also below). The Complex of RanGDP and Nup153-ZnF2 Interestingly, in the crystals of space group I222, the ZnF2 moiety is sandwiched by a second, symmetry-related Ran molecule, although the complex in solution is a 1:1 heterodimer (Figure 3B). We assume that this additional contact (termed ``B'' in the subsequent text) originates from crystal packing, whereas the contact in the asymmetric unit (termed ``A'') represents the binding site with the higher affinity, since a number of recently identified residues of ZnF2 that are crucial for Ran binding (Higa et al., 2007) are located in contact A (see below). Furthermore, mutation of Phe714 and Phe718 of ZnF2 in contact A strongly decreases the affinity of the complex (see below). In addition, the total number of interactions is higher for contact A, and, along the same lines, the interacting surface area was calculated ° as 1633 A2, which is significantly larger than the surface area of ° contact B with the symmetry-related Ran molecule (1142 A2). However, we cannot rule out physiological relevance for the B interface, which, despite its (in all likelihood) weaker affinity, might still be involved in Ran coordination, especially at high local Ran concentrations at the distal ring of the nuclear basket (see the Discussion). The Interface between Ran and Nup153-ZnF2 Nup153ZnF2 binds Ran via a bipartite interface constituted of mainly hydrophobic, but also electrostatic, interactions (Figures 3A, 4A, and 4B). As mentioned above, Phe714Nup153 and Phe718Nup153 make numerous hydrophobic contacts inside a hydrophobic pocket of Ran with, for example, residues Val9Ran,

Phe11Ran, Arg56Ran, Ile59Ran, Leu 168Ran, Ile169Ran, and Leu174Ran, which are located in b strands 1, 3, and 4 and a helix 7 of Ran. We quantified the contribution of both Phe residues to the binding affinity by comparing a F714A/F718A double mutant to wild-type ZnF2 via concentration-dependent peak shifts of Ran in NMR titration experiments, and found a KD of 120 mM for the mutant compared to 60 mM for wild-type ZnF2 (Figure 4D). This value differs from the KD determined by Higa et al. (2007) (5 mM) for a shorter ZnF2 construct in a Biacore setup, which might be due to different experimental conditions. Thus, this short N-terminal stretch of ZnF2 can be viewed as the first part of the interface. The second part involves the residues of the functionally important ``LVA'' motif (Higa et al., 2007), consisting of Leu731Nup153, Val732Nup153, and Ala743Nup153 of the zinc finger, which participates in additional hydrophobic contacts (Figure 3A) (Ran secondary structure elements in parenthesis): Leu731Nup153 contacts Lys38Ran (b2), Val47Ran (b3), and Pro49Ran (b3); Val732Nup153 binds to Lys12Ran (b1) and Trp64Ran (b4); Ala743Nup153 interacts with Leu43Ran (switch I), Trp64Ran (b4), and Gly78Ran. Furthermore, three potential hydrogen bonds stabilize the complex: Asp726Nup153 binds to Pro7Ran, Glu733Nup153 makes a hydrogen bond to Glu82Ran, and the main chain of Cys744Nup153 contacts Thr42Ran (switch I) (Figure 3A). The B contact described above is situated in a surface area of Ran opposite to the A contact area (Figure 3B), and involves mainly contacts between the main chain atoms of Gly74Ran and Leu75Ran by Ala721Nup153 and Lys719Nup153, as well as a hydrogen bond between Asp77Ran and Asp716Nup153 (data not shown). The surface potential distribution of both proteins is of a mixed nature, with comparable fractions of positive and negative potentials (Figure 4A). In contrast to the rest of the surface, the interface of the complex is more hydrophobic, as is evident from the ``open-book'' representation in Figure 4B. In the N-terminal part of ZnF2, the hydrophobic and bulky Phe714 and Phe718 residues are prominent, as is their matching hydrophobic pocket in Ran (Figure 4B). The second part of the contact area of Nup153ZnF2, which is formed by both b hairpins, displays a

positive potential, which is, however, opposed by a (weakly) basic Ran surface, so that there is no charge complementarity. In summary, the surface potential analysis highlights the observation that binding of Ran to Nup153 is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, rather than electrostatic interactions. Nucleotide Specificity in ZnF2 Binding We found the interaction of Ran with ZnF2 to be independent of the guanine nucleotide phosphorylation state: RanGTP (represented by either Ran complexed with GppNHp or the GTP containing RanQ69L mutant, which is defective in GTP hydrolysis), as well as RanGDP, bind with similar affinity to ZnF2 in pulldown assays (see Figure S1A, lanes 7, 8, and 9, in the Supplemental Data available online), which is in good agreement with the recent study by Higa et al. (2007). Upon GTP hydrolysis, Ran undergoes conformational changes that mostly affect three switch regions (switch I, residues 28­48; switch II, residues 65­84; switch III, residues 173­216; Figure 5) (Vetter et al., 1999b). The switch region III that includes the C-terminal helix (a10) is not involved in any

direct contact, but switches I and II in RanGDP contribute to the edges of the ZnF2 binding interface (Figures 1C, 3A, and 5). The interactions of switch II (residues 78, 81, and 82) are in a region where the conformation does not change drastically upon nucleotide exchange, so that no major effect on affinity is expected. In contrast, the switch I region changes dramatically in the contact area, and would decrease the accessible surface ° buried by the zinc finger by one quarter, from 1959 to 1443 A2 (the model for calculating the latter value was built by superimposing RanGppNHp from the Ran-RanBD1 complex [PDB ID: 1rrp] onto the RanGDP moiety of the zinc finger complex; Figure 5B). The conformational rearrangement of the switch I loop affects a potential hydrogen bond between RanGDP and the zinc finger, from OG of Thr42Ran to the carbonyl oxygen of Cys744Nup153. All other interactions affected by the rearrangement of the switch I region appear to be rather weak. Since it has been shown in NMR solution studies on free Ran that the switch regions display an intrinsic flexibility (Geyer et al., 1999), one can assume that all contacts mediated by residues located in these regions contribute less to an interaction compared with

Ran-Nup153ZnF2 Structure

whether the second binding motif is ordered in solution, we performed two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments on the free ZnF2. In 2D rotational nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY), nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), and natural abundance 1H-15N-HSQC spectra, resonances could only be detected for residues Ile722Nup153­ Lys748Nup153, corresponding to the zinc coordinating core motif (Figure 4C and data not shown). Thus, the N-terminal residues Ser703Nup153­Ala721Nup153, which include the hydrophobic binding motif of ZnF2, as well as the C-terminal residues, Pro749Nup153­Lys754Nup153, are highly flexible in solution, and could not be detected in the NMR spectra. This finding indicates that the N-terminal binding motif of Nup153ZnF2 (Phe714, Phe718) undergoes an induced fit upon interaction with Ran, as it is structurally defined in the crystal structure of the complex. In addition, chemical exchange peaks could be detected for the amide resonances of the residues T724, W725, D726, D728, N734, A738, V739, and V742 of Nup153ZnF2 in homonuclear 2D ROESY spectra. Obviously, a major part of Nup153ZnF2 is affected by chemical exchange processes, including the core residue W725 (Figure 4C). In addition, the amide resonances for residues W725, C727, V732, E737, and V739 show ROE chemical exchange peaks to the bulk water frequency (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that only the residues involved in the zinc coordination of Nup153ZnF2 and their flanking amino acids are structurally well defined in solution, whereas the remaining residues are either disordered or affected by chemical exchange processes in the free form. However, the N-terminal part of the structure is rigidified in an induced-fit-like manner upon binding to Ran (Figure 2B). DISCUSSION The crystal structure of the RanGDP-Nup153ZnF2 (residues 703Nup153 to 754Nup153) complex reveals the molecular details of this essential interaction. ZnF2 binding to Ran is mainly mediated by the interaction of the two zinc coordinating b hairpins with the LVA patch (Higa et al., 2007) as the key motif. The larger ZnF2 fragment used in this study now reveals a second binding interface that comprises a hydrophobic pocket in Ran (Figures 3A and 4B). Phe714Nup153 and Phe718Nup153 display interesting properties: (1) most strikingly, a F714A/F718A double mutant significantly reduces the affinity to Ran from 60 mM to 120 mM (Figure 4D); (2) Phe718 is strictly conserved in all Nup153ZnF2s of higher eukaryotes (Figure S1B); (3) also, all four zinc finger motifs of R. norvegicus Nup153 have at least one of these two Phe residues: ZnF2 and ZnF3 have both Phe residues whereas Phe714 is replaced by Gly846 in ZnF4 and Phe718 by Leu656 in ZnF1 (Figure 1A); (4) finally, both Phe residues are also present and largely conserved in R. norvegicus and Homo sapiens Nup358 (Figure S1C). These data clearly indicate a general implication of the N-terminal flanking region of RanBP2-type zinc fingers in Ran binding. Our NMR studies prove that this N-terminal binding motif is unstructured in solution and becomes ordered by an induced-fit mechanism upon interaction with Ran (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the complex unveils that--unlike what has been proposed from NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments--Cys730Nup153 is not significantly involved in Ran binding (Higa et al., 2007). The same is true for

residues that are part of the rigid core structure of Ran. Indeed, the affinity of a RanT42A mutant appears similar to that of Ran wild-type in a pull-down assay (data not shown). This could explain why the affinity of ZnF2 to Ran is only slightly reduced for the GTP form (Higa et al., 2007; Figure S1A).

Whereas the mutant ZnF2 forms a fast exchanging complex on the NMR chemical shift scale, the wild-type protein forms a slow exchanging complex, corresponding to a KD value of 60 mM compared with a significantly lower 120 mM for the mutant of ZnF2.

Nevertheless, in addition to the crucial LVA motif identified by Higa et al. (2007), the main chain of Cys744Nup153 indeed could form a potential hydrogen bond to Thr42Ran in the crystal structure. The C terminus of Ran is functionally crucial, as found in various studies (Vetter et al., 1999b; Villa Braslavsky et al., 2000). Most importantly, it drives the interactions with RanBD and importin-b by switching from an open conformation (RanGTP, binding to importin-b, RanBD) to a closed conformation (RanGDP, binding to NTF2), thus triggering binding and dissociation with the respective interaction partner. Based on our com-

plex structure, as well as a structural comparison of RanGDP, RanGTP, and different Ran complex structures (data not shown), there is no indication that the C terminus of Ran (residues 181­ 205, including helix a10) directly interferes with Nup153ZnF2 binding. Implications for Nuclear Transport The zinc finger domains of Nup153 are located in the central part of the protein, and have been localized at the distal ring of the nuclear basket (Pante et al., 1994). As a component of the cytoplasmic filaments, Nup358 also carries eight zinc fingers. Comparing the amino acid sequence of the ZnF2 construct used here with the zinc finger sequences of Nup358 reveals the expected high

degree of sequence conservation, as both proteins form RanBP2-type zinc fingers of the same fold. Almost all functionally important residues are conserved (Figure S1C), including Phe714Nup153 and Phe718Nup153, which both have counterparts in Nup358. This high similarity of the zinc finger sites of Nup153 in the nucleoplasm and Nup358 at the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC thus generates symmetric binding sites for Ran that might mark ``turning points'' of the Ran cycle across the nuclear envelope, where binding partners are exchanged efficiently due to a higher local concentration of Ran. A stably integrated population of the multifunctional Nup153 was identified at the nuclear basket of the NPC and has been suggested to function in nuclear import (Krull et al., 2004; Rabut et al., 2004). In the case of eight Nup153 molecules at the distal ring of the NPC, a maximum of 32 Ran molecules could be associated with the NPC and form a reservoir to terminate import complexes. In this respect, it appears interesting that the crystals of the Ran-Nup153ZnF2 complex show a ``sandwich'' packing of one ZnF2 and two Ran molecules (Figure 3B). This could be caused simply by crystal packing, but could also explain the observed superstoichiometric, cooperative binding of Ran by full-length Nup153 (Higa et al., 2007). In such a scenario, one zinc finger motif could coordinate up to two Ran molecules, which would further increase the ``reservoir'' size of RanGTP at the nuclear basket terminal ring. In the cell, the opposite scenario also seems possible: each Ran molecule could be coordinated by two zinc finger domains of Nup153, with increased affinity in a situation in which a single zinc finger binds. During nucleocytoplasmic transport, Ran interacts with a number of functionally and structurally diverse proteins--namely, RCC1, RanGAP, RanBP1, NTF2, and importin-b. Under steric aspects, binding to Nup153ZnF2 does not interfere with Ran's interaction partners RCC1 and RanGAP, as shown by a superimposition of the corresponding Ran complex structures (Figure 6A). In conclusion, a simultaneous binding of Ran to RCC1 and Nup153 might allow for nucleotide exchange in a ternary complex, corresponding with the ability of Nup153ZnF2 to bind both RanGDP as well as RanGTP. Binding to NTF2 would only affect the Ran-Nup153ZnF2 complex to a small extent, involving the C-terminal region of NTF2. In contrast, the N-terminal region of RanBD1, which has been demonstrated to be crucial for Ran binding (residues 1­34), would overlap with the N-terminal part of ZnF2 when superimposed to the crystal structure

presented here (Figure 6A). Most strikingly, a Ran-Nup153 complex excludes simultaneous binding to importin-b, as the N terminus (residues 3­19) of a superimposed importin-b would be located at the position of the central zinc coordinating b hairpin in ZnF2 (Figures 6A and 6B). This could indicate an import complex terminating function of the RanGTP-Nup153 complex, since Ran binding to importin-b would release the cargo and, at the same time, automatically trigger the release of Ran from its zinc finger binding site. An overview of this model is shown in Figure 7. Likewise, binding of the importin b homolog and nuclear export receptor Cse1 to Ran would also interfere with Nup153ZnF2 binding (data not shown). Interestingly, a very recent study (Lim et al., 2007) reports conformational changes of the Nup153 FG repeat domains at the nuclear basket upon interaction with importin-b that are reversed by RanGTP. In detail, RanGTP restores collapsed Nup153 FG repeats back to their brush-like structure (compare also to Figure 7)--a regulation mechanism that could be explained and mediated by the interaction presented here via different conformations of Nup153, dependent on the saturation of its zinc finger domains with Ran.

Conclusions Taken together, the crystal structure of the Ran-ZnF2 complex revealed what is, to our knowledge, a new and unique binding interface on Ran, which now allows us to draw a refined picture of Ran's protein-protein interactions on the way from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and back in higher eukaryotes (Figure 7). When RanGTP--as part of an export complex or in complex with importin-b--exits the NPC at the cytoplasmic site, it binds to the zinc finger sites of Nup358 (RanBP2, cytoplasmic filaments) to support hydrolysis to the GDP form by the RanGAP attached to Nup358, thus terminating the export complexes. In a very similar fashion, after RanGDP has shuffeled back through the NPC channel, Ran binds to the zinc fingers of Nup153 at the nuclear basket. These can now provide the platform for nucleotide exchange by RCC1, which can take place while Ran remains bound to the zinc finger. Subsequently, RanGTP might remain associated with the distal ring until it takes action in the termination of an import complex by binding to importin-b with high affinity--an interaction that leads to immediate dissociation from Nup153. Thus, Nup153 could increase the efficiency of nuclear

Ran-Nup153ZnF2 Structure

Figure 7. Model of a Local Ran Reservoir at the Distal Ring of the NPC Mediated by Nup153
Nup153 (dark gray) with its zinc fingers (gold) and its FG repeat domain (light gray) associates at the distal ring of the NPC basket structure (NPC presented in cross-section). Ran (red), either complexed with GDP (blue dots) or GTP (green dots), can bind to Nup153ZnFs and, for nucleotide exchange, a ternary complex with RCC1 (green) can be formed at the distal ring. Importin-b (blue) in complex with a cargo protein (black) translocates through the nuclear pore channel by interacting with the FG repeats (white). After exiting the NPC central channel on the nucleoplasmic side, the reservoir of bound RanGTP at the distal ring serves to efficiently terminate the import complex. Hereby, the association of RanGTP with the ZnFs of Nup153 is released upon binding to importinb (higher affinity), and the cargo is set free into the nucleoplasm. Subsequently, importin-b can shuttle back into the cytoplasm for another round of import.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Ran and ZnF2 Human Ran was expressed recombinantly from the vector pET3d (NcoI/ BamHI) in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) by standard chromatography techniques, as described previously (Hillig et al., 1999; Kuhlmann et al., 1997). The phosphorylation state of the bound nucleotide was analyzed by analytical HPLC runs and found to be almost exclusively GDP (data not shown). Isolated Ran was concentrated to 20­30 mg/ml (20 mM KPO4 [pH 7.4]; 100 mM KCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 5% sucrose) and stored at À80 C after flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Nup153ZnF2 (fragment coding for residues 703­754) was cloned into a modified pGEX-4T1 (Amersham, GE Healthcare) vector, where a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site was introduced between the thrombin and the NcoI site of pGEX-4T1. The recombinant protein was expressed in the E. coli strain

BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene) with 50 mM ZnCl2 added to the media. Cells were grown a 37 C to an OD600 of 0.5 until adding 100 mM IPTG to induce protein expression overnight at 23 C. Out of the cell lysate, Nup153ZnF2 was bound to a GSH column via the GST-tag (100 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris, 3 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1% NP40, 1 mM PMSF, 50 mM ZnCl2 [pH 7.5]). After intensive washing, the Ran-Nup153ZnF2 complex was assembled on the GSH column with bound, GST tag-coupled ZnF2 by adding purified RanGDP. After an incubation time of 1 hr, the complex was eluted from the column by TEV cleavage of the GST tag, and the 63 His-tagged TEV protease was subsequently removed by incubation with Ni-NTA Superflow beads (QIAGEN). By this protocol, the complex could be isolated to homogeneity, and was subjected to crystallization studies after concentration to 6.3 mg/ml, flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, and storage at À80 C. Crystallization Initial crystals of the purified RanGDP-Nup153ZnF2 complex were obtained from the JCSG+ screen (100 nl sitting drop, Solution 83, Nextal). Optimization at a protein concentration of 6.3 mg/ml in a hanging drop vapor diffusion setup with 2 M ammonium sulfate buffered with BisTris to pH 5.5 yielded crystals (0.1 3 0.05 3 0.05 mm) used for data collection. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen with 25% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Data Collection, Processing, and Model Building Data collection was performed at beamline PX-II of the Swiss Light Source ° (Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland) at a wavelength of 1.2726 A, corresponding to the K edge of zinc, which allowed the collection of an anomalous zinc signal. Data were processed with the XDS (Kabsch, 1993) and

DENZO/SCALEPACK suites (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Indexing of the ° data revealed a unit cell of 70 3 75 3 123 A belonging to space group I222. With one RanGDP-ZnF2 complex in the asymmetric unit, the packing corre° sponds to a Mathews coefficient of 2.7 A3/Da and a solvent content of 54%. The structure of the RanGDP-Nup153ZnF2 complex was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (Murshudov et al., 1997) and Ran-GDP (Scheffzek et al., 1995) as the search model. Refinement of the model was performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) for solvent flattening and simulated annealing, followed by TLS refinement (Winn et al., 2001) of the manually interpreted electron density (COOT, Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). The Ramachandran statistics of the final model are: 88.8% (core region), 7.1% (additionally allowed), 3.1% (generously allowed) and 1% (disallowed regions), and highlight the excellent stereochemistry of the model. NMR Spectroscopy The spectra with water flip-back and WATERGATE solvent suppression were recorded at 600.13 MHz proton frequency and at 293K on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer equipped with a pulsed field gradient and a triple-resonance probe head. The 1D 1H NMR spectra were recorded for 1.363 s with a time domain of 32,768 data points and a sweep width of 12019.230 Hz. The sweep width of the two-dimensional homonuclear spectra was 7183.908 Hz in the direct and in the indirect 1H dimension (free-induction decay acquired for 142.660 ms, dwell time 69.6 ms). 2D natural abundance 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded with procedures described previously (Mori et al., 1995) (freeinduction decay acquired for 85.288 ms, dwell time 41.6 ms, time domain of 1024 complex data points, and 64 complex increments). The sweep width of the heteronuclear spectra was 12019.231 Hz in the 1H and 2736.727 Hz in the 15N dimension. Homonuclear spectra were zero-filled to 2048 3 2048 points prior to Fourier transformation. Sine apodization functions were applied in both dimensions. Assignments were obtained from 2D TOCSY, NOESY, and ROESY, as previously published (Bax et al., 1985; Davis and Bax, 1985a; Song and Markley, 2001; Stoll et al., 2001a, 2001b). The binding studies (method described by Stoll et al., 2001a) were performed by titrating RanGDP with stoichiometric amounts of either Nup153ZnF2, or with upto a 5-fold excess of the mutant Nup153ZnF2 (F714A/F718A) (buffer: 50 mM Na/K phosphate [pH 7.2], 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1mM b-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% sucrose). Assignment and Structure Calculation All spectra were processed with NMRPipe and analyzed with NMRView (Delaglio et al., 1995; Johnson and Blevins, 1994). Assignment, data handling, and control of XPLOR-NIH (Schwieters et al., 2006) calculations were performed with NMRView and ATNOS (Brunger et al., 1998; Herrmann et al., 2002; Johnson and Blevins, 1994; Schwieters et al., 2006). A total of 261 NOEs were derived from the 2D NOESY spectra. Peak heights were used for quantification of peak intensities supplemented with 12 torsion angle constraints for regular secondary structure elements and the zinc coordination. Five classes of NOEs were distinguished, and sequential Ha(i)­HN(i + 1) signals within b elements were rated as strong NOEs. Other NOE intensities were then ascribed according to this internal calibration (Stoll et al., 1997, 2001b). Protons were explicitly defined in the dynamically simulated annealing calculations, except in some cases, where a pseudoatom correction was used (Brunger et al., 1998; Schwieters et al., 2006). Structure calculations were performed with standard protocols implemented in the program XPLOR-NIH (Schwieters et al., 2006). The ensemble of final structures of Nup153ZnF2 does not show any NOE constraint violation ° greater than 0.5 A or any angle constraint violation greater than 5 .
