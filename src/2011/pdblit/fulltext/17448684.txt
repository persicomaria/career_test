Macromolecular Crystallography Group European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, B.P. 220 6 rue Jules Horowitz, F-38043 Grenoble Cedex, France Trehalose (a-D-glucopyranosyl-1,1-a-D-glucopyranose) is a non-reducing diglucoside found in various organisms that serves as a carbohydrate reserve and as an agent that protects against a variety of physical and chemical stresses. Deinococcus radiodurans possesses an alternative biosynthesis pathway for the synthesis of trehalose from maltooligosaccharides. This reaction is mediated by two enzymes: maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (MTSase) and maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (MTHase). Here, ° we present the 1.1 A resolution crystal structure of MTHase. It consists of three major domains: two b-sheet domains and a conserved glycosidase (b/a)8 barrel catalytic domain. Three subdomains consisting of short insertions were identified within the catalytic domain. Subsequently, structures of MTHase in complex with maltose and trehalose were ° ° obtained at 1.2 A and 1.5 A resolution, respectively. These structures reveal the importance of the three inserted subdomains in providing the key residues required for substrate recognition. Trehalose is recognised specifically in the C1 and C2 binding subsites by an extensive hydrogen-bonding network and a strong hydrophobic stacking interaction in between two aromatic residues. Moreover, upon binding to maltose, which mimics the substrate sugar chain, a major concerted conformational change traps the sugar chain in the active site. The presence of magnesium in the active site of the MTHase­maltose complex suggests that MTHase activity may be regulated by divalent cations.

Keywords: Deinococcus radiodurans; trehalose; a-amylase; protein­carbohydrate complex; desiccation resistance

Deinococcus radiodurans is a Gram-positive eubacterium that displays an extraordinary resistance to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents, such as ionising radiation and desiccation.1 Ionising radiation induces DNA double-strand breaks, which are the most lethal form of DNA damage. While only a few double-strand breaks can be tolerated and repaired in most species, D. radiodurans can

withstand and mend over 100 double-strand breaks in its genomic DNA.2,3 Initial results support the view that the extreme radiation resistance of D. radiodurans is complex and most likely determined by a combination of factors such as efficient DNA repair machinery, genome packing and cell structure.4­7 Since there is no terrestrial environment that generates high doses of radiation, the radiation resistance of D. radiodurans has been proposed to have arisen by selection for desiccation resistance.1 The removal of water from a cell is a severe, often lethal stress. During desiccation, cell metabolism is arrested completely and subsequently needs to be fully recovered during rehydration, and extensive damage is caused to DNA (including double-strand breaks), proteins and lipid membranes.8 Damage to DNA and proteins is mediated mostly through

reactive oxygen species. As for lipid membranes, dehydration leads to a significant increase in the phase transition (liquid-crystal to gel state) temperature of membranes, which results in a highly permeable membrane upon rehydration.8 Certain sugars have been shown to contribute to the stability of proteins, membranes and whole cells during prolonged dehydration. In particular, trehalose appears to be the most effective stabiliser of dried proteins9 and membranes.10 Trehalose is a non-reducing a-1,1-linked disaccharide (a-D-glucopyranosyl-1,1-a-D-glucopyranose) that accumulates in organisms under stress conditions.11 Evidence suggests that trehalose protects membranes and proteins by serving as a water substitute.12 Recent studies have also revealed that trehalose can act as a free radical scavenger and thus protect proteins and DNA from damage caused by oxygen radicals.10 At least three different pathways for the biological synthesis of trehalose have been described. The best studied pathway is that involving the enzyme trehalose phosphate synthase that catalyses the transfer of glucose from uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose to glucose 6-phosphate to produce trehalose 6-phosphate plus UDP. 10,13,14

Interestingly, this usually essential pathway seems to be missing from D. radiodurans. 5 Instead, D. radiodurans appears to use two alternative pathways for trehalose biosynthesis. It possesses the gene encoding trehalose synthase (DR2036), which in Pimelobacter sp. R48 has been shown to catalyse the conversion of the a-1,4-glycosidic linkage of maltose to the a-1,1-glycosidic bond of trehalose.15 In addition, D. radiodurans has two extra genes for trehalose metabolism, which encode a maltooligosyltrehalose synthase (DR0463; MTSase) and a maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (DR0464; MTHase). Together these proteins catalyse a twostep reaction that breaks down maltooligosaccharides or starch into trehalose. The first enzyme (MTSase) converts the glycosidic bond between the last two glucose moieties from an a-1,4-linkage to an a-1,1-linkage, thus producing a non-reducing glycosyl trehaloside. The second enzyme (MTHase) cleaves the a-1,4-linkage adjacent to the a-1,1glycosidic bond to release free trehalose (Figure 1(a) and (b)). MTHase is a member of the a-amylase family of (b/a)8 barrel glycosidases (family 13),16 which comprises enzymes with a wide variety of known

activities including a-amylase, pullulanase, cyclomaltodextrinase, trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase, a-glucosidase, trehalose synthase, amylosucrase and sucrose phosphorylase. The crystal structures of a-amylases from various sources have been solved,17­24 and reveal a common protein scaffold, the (b/a)8 barrel, on the top of which the active site is situated.25 However, insertions within this conserved (b/a)8 barrel are variable and most likely contribute to the enzyme specificity. Although the crystal structure of Sulfolobus solfataricus MTHase (ssMTHase) has been solved,21 the mechanisms involved in the specific recognition of maltooligotrehalosides are still poorly understood. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of D. radiodurans MTHase (DrMTHase) in its apo form and with disaccharides (maltose and trehalose) bound in its substrate-binding cleft. These structures reveal the important residues required for the specific recognition of trehalose in the

undergone proteolysis at its N terminus. Consequently, there was no electron density visible for the N-terminal histidine-tag and the first 13 residues of the protein. In addition, a loop region (residues 473­481) is largely disordered in the structure and is missing from the final model. The high-resolution data enabled us to model 43 residues in two or more conformations.

DrMTHase is a monomer and displays three major domains (Figure 2): an N-terminal domain (domain N) that consists of an eight-stranded immunoglobulin-like Greek-key fold (residues 26­126); a central catalytic (b/a)8 barrel domain (domain A; residues 127­533); and a C-terminal domain (domain C) that consists of a six-stranded g-crystallin-type fold (residues 534­602). The N

ARTICLE IN PRESS
6 domain is connected to domain A via a long, fully extended linker (residues 108­126; Figure 2(c)) and packs tightly against the N-terminal side of the (b/a)8 barrel, while domain C packs against the C-terminal side of the (b/a)8 barrel. Three additional subdomains (domain B: residues 214­249; domain D: residues 340­390; domain E: residues 441­505) protrude from the central domain A (Figure 2). The domains are named according to a-amylase nomenclature.25 The secondary structure elements are labelled numerically within each domain (e.g. Nb1 corresponds to the first b-strand of domain N; Figure 1(c)) and within the catalytic A domain the secondary structure elements are labelled numerically and alphabetically according to their appearance in the (b/a)8 barrel (Figures 1(c) and 2(a)). Domains A, B and C, unlike domains N, D and E, are found in all members of the family 13 glycosidases.25 Comparison of our crystal structures obtained for the apo form and sugar-bound DrMTHase reveals that the overall conformation of DrMTHase in complex with sugars is essentially the same as the native structure, with average root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.) between the native DrMTHase and the DrMTHase­maltose and DrMTHase­tre° ° halose complexes of 0.23 A and 0.16 A, respectively, for the equivalent Ca positions of 575 aligned residues. In all three structures of DrMTHase, a magnesium ion is involved in crystal packing and is coordinated octahedrally by Asp540, Asp113 (from a symmetry-related molecule) in unidentate modes and four water molecules. The catalytic domain The central domain consists of a (b/a)8 TIM barrel with three insertions (subdomains B, D and E). The barrel domain contains the four conserved regions that are diagnostic for members of the a-amylase family 13 (Figure 1(c)). Three strictly conserved carboxylic acid residues are found in family 13 glycosidases, which have been shown by mutagenesis studies to be the essential catalytic residues.26 Sequence and structural comparison have revealed that these residues correspond to Asp275, Glu308 and Asp400 in DrMTHase. Throughout the family, the enzymes are believed to share a similar catalytic mechanism,27 in which they hydrolyse glycosidic bonds via a retaining mechanism that involves a double-displacement reaction (Figure 1(b)).28 The general acid catalyst (Glu308) donates a proton for cleavage of the glycosidic bond, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond between the remaining sugar moiety and a second carboxylic acid residue (the nucleophile, Asp275). A water molecule then hydrolyses the glycosyl­enzyme complex in a second displacement reaction in which the deprotonated catalytic acid now acts as a base catalyst. A second aspartic acid residue, Asp400, is not involved in the catalysis directly, but rather has been proposed to stabilise the transition state and maintain Glu308 in the
Structure of Maltooligosyltrehalose Hydrolase

correct protonation state.29 These catalytic residues are situated on the top of the (b/a)8 barrel (Figure 2(b) and (c)). Asp275 and Glu308 are located at the C-terminal tips of b-strands Ab4 and Ab5, respectively, while Asp400 is contributed by a short a-helix linking Ab7 to Aa7 (Figures 1(c) and 2(b)). Structural comparison of DrMTHase with structures of a-amylase bound to their substrate30­34 reveals that the essential water molecule that was proposed to act as the nucleophile in the second step of the catalytic mechanism31 (Figure 1(b)) bridges two of the catalytic side-chains (Glu308 and Asp400). The positions of the water molecules in the active-site pocket of DrMTHase are highly conserved. Subdomain B, which corresponds to an insertion between Ab3 and Aa3 of the (b/a)8 barrel (Figure 2), is rather short in the case of DrMTHase (as in ssMTHase). This domain contains a flexible region (residues 237­242) connecting Bb1 to Bb2 with an ° unusually high B-factor (average: 32.05 A2, as ° 2 for all protein atoms), which opposed to 9.51 A was manually built during refinement. Subdomain D, which corresponds to an insertion between Aa6 and Ab7, consists of a long a-helix followed by a b-hairpin structure (Figure 2). The loop connecting domain A and subdomain D, together with the b-hairpin form a lid over the C-terminal side of the (b/a)8 barrel. Subdomain E, which is missing from most members of the a-amylase family,29­32,35 consists of a long a-helix (Ea1), followed by two smaller ones (Ea2 and Ea3) that connect Ab8 and Aa8 of domain A. The long a-helix (Ea1; residues 459­470) lies above the active site and the loop region (residues 473­481) connecting this helix to the following shorter helices is missing from the final refined model, implying that this structural unit is highly flexible (Figure 2(b) and (c)). DrMTHase­trehalose complex The DrMTHase­trehalose complex structure was ° solved to 1.5 A resolution and seven trehalose molecules and two single glucose rings could be built into the electron density maps. Four of the trehalose molecules are involved in crystal packing. One trehalose molecule (Tre1) sits at the entry of the channel leading to the active site. This molecule interacts with the B subdomain via specific hydrogen bonding to Gly219, Pro220, Gly222, Asn223 and Trp241, and one of its rings stacks against Tyr224 (Figure 3(a)). The binding of this disaccharide to the B domain results in a partial conformational change in the flexible loop region (residues 237­242) relative to its position in the apo form. In the complex, this loop was refined in a double conformation with a higher occupancy (occupancy of 0.7) and lower B-factors for the displaced loop, which moves Trp241 towards the sugar, enabling it to hydrogen bond directly to the sugar ring and to stack against Pro220 (Figure 3(a)). Additionally, an extra trehalose molecule and two single glucose rings could be modelled into electron density at the

exit of the substrate-binding cleft, thus indicating a possible pathway for product release. For two of these molecules, only a single glucose ring could be modelled. The glucose moieties make very few contacts with the protein in this region, which may explain their high B-factors (Table 2). Most importantly, a trehalose molecule (Tre2) could be modelled into the C1 and C2 subsites (according to the glycosyl hydrolase nomenclature36) of the substrate-binding cleft (Figure 3(b)­(d)). Unlike the other trehalose molecules present in the structure, Tre2 was refined with a partial

occupancy of 0.8. The major difference between a maltooligosaccharide and a maltooligotrehaloside substrate is the orientation of the terminal glucose moiety (Figure 1(a)), implying that the C2 subsite is the most critical region for specific substrate recognition (Figure 3(b)). This is indeed the case in the DrMTHase­trehalose complex. Although both rings make contacts with the protein either directly or via water molecules, the ring in the C2 subsite is additionally stacked between His310 and Tyr345 (Figure 3(c)), thus positioning the trehaloside sugar chain for hydrolysis in the active site. The B-factors

ARTICLE IN PRESS
8 for the ring at the C2 site are much lower than those of the ring at the C1 site, suggesting that the hydrophobic stacking between His310 and Tyr345 contributes significantly to its stability. The electron density for the ring in the C2 site is also much better defined than that at the C1 site (Figure 3(d)). Moreover, the a-1,1-glycosidic linkage of the trehalose molecule is recognised specifically by His332, which hydrogen bonds directly to the O6 atom of both rings (Figure 3(c) and (d)). The ring in the C1 subsite also interacts with Asn404, which is positioned just above the active-site residue Asp400 (Figure 3(c)). The ring at the C2 subsite is hydrogen bonded directly to His332 and Glu376, but Asp328, Asp329, Arg380 and Tyr349 also stabilise this ring via contacts through water molecules (Figure 3(c)). DrMTHase­maltose complex The structure of DrMTHase in complex with maltose (an a-1,4-linked disaccharide that mimics a short portion of a maltooligosaccharide chain) ° was solved to 1.2 A resolution. As in the case of trehalose, the final refined model contains seven sugar molecules. Three of these maltose molecules are involved in crystal packing, two of which are found in similar positions to the trehalose. Another maltose molecule makes extensive contacts with the long linker that joins the N domain to the A domain and with the bottom of the (b/a)8 barrel. This interaction is most likely contributing to the stability of the protein, but may not be biologically relevant, since the binding site is far from the active site. Additionally, there is a maltose molecule (Mal1) in the C2 and C3 subsites. The ring in the C2 site makes similar hydrogen-bonding interactions as the trehalose ring at the equivalent position; however, the maltose ring is not stabilised by the hydrophobic stacking against His310. The C3 subsite is located at the exit of the active site, in close proximity to where the glucose moiety was found in the DrMTHase­trehalose complex. Moreover, two maltose moieties were found in the entry channel leading to the active site. One of these molecules (Mal2) is located very close to the entry site, with one of its rings closely overlapping with the trehalose molecule at the equivalent position (corresponding to the K6 subsite). The second maltose molecule (Mal3), however, is tightly bound at the K2 and K3 subsites (Figures 3(b) and 4(a) and (b)). For this interaction to take place, the long a-helix of subdomain E (Ea1) undergoes a significant conformational change in which it closes down on the maltose, in order to trap it in the channel leading to the active site (Figure 4(c)). This new conformation of Ea1 is now kinked at residue ° 464, resulting in a 208 bend in the helix and a 6.4 A a displacement of the C atom of Phe472. Two strictly conserved residues from this helix, Arg468 and Glu471, are subsequently close enough to hydrogen bond to the maltose (Figure 4(a) and (b)). As a result of this conformational change, the previously disordered loop (residues 473­481) could now
Structure of Maltooligosyltrehalose Hydrolase

easily be built into the electron density (Figure 4(c)). This maltose molecule is further stabilised by hydrophobic stacking interactions with Phe452 and Trp241 (Figure 4(a)). The stacking of Trp241 onto the maltose ring locks the previously described flexible region (in the apo enzyme) protruding from subdomain B into a defined position, as can be deduced from the considerable reduction in the average B-factor for residues 237­242 in the ° DrMTHase­maltose complex (average: 16.24 A2) ° as opposed to the apo enzyme (average 32.05 A2 for an occupancy of 0.8). In addition to sugars, a second magnesium ion was refined into the electron density obtained from the DrMTHase­maltose complex (Figure 4(d)). Since the crystals of DrMTHase­maltose were grown in 0.1 M MgCl2 and refinement with a water molecule at this position left positive difference electron density, a partially occupied Mg2C (occupancy: 0.7) was modelled at this position. Moreover, this Mg2C is located in the active site, where it is coordinated octahedrally by the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp400 and Glu308 (in unidentate modes) and four well-ordered water molecules (W2­W5 in Figure 4(d)). Asp275, the third catalytic residue, is involved in hydrogen bonding to these water molecules. Overlay of the active-site residues of DrMTHase and Barley a-amylase31 bound to maltose and acarbose (transition-state analogue) respectively, reveals that the Mg2C bound in DrMTHase is located very close to the position of the non-hydrolysable N4-B group of acarbose. This corresponds to the position of the glycosidic oxygen atom of the substrate sugar bond to be cleaved. The essential water molecule that was proposed to act as the nucleophile in the second step of the catalytic mechanism,31 W1 in Figure 4(d), is located very close to the Mg2C, implying that hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond could most likely not occur with Mg2C bound at this site.

Discussion
The overall crystal structure of DrMTHase is similar to that of ssMTHase,21 the major difference being that DrMTHase is a monomer and is missing the crucial cysteine residue involved in ssMTHase dimerisation. The structures of DrMTHase in its apo form and in complex with either maltose or trehalose have shed light on its mode of substrate binding and recognition. Importantly, DrMTHase contains a typical a-amylase (b/a)8 barrel domain, where all three inserted subdomains B, D and E are crucial for substrate binding. The N and C domains So far very little is known about the functional role of the N and C domains of trehalohydrolases. N domains are found in only a few members of the family 13 glycosidases and are not structurally related.37 In DrMTHase, the N-terminal domain

appears to play an essential role in stabilising the protein architecture. It packs closely against Aa3 from domain A and the inserted subdomain B, thus stabilising these rather flexible regions. It is interesting that, although there is no extensive interaction between the N domain of DrMTHase and the disaccharides, His101 stacks against the first ring of

the maltose molecule (Mal2) at the entrance of the channel leading to the active site (Figure 5(a)). The N domain may therefore be involved in the initial steps of sugar binding in addition to contributing significantly to protein stability. The C domain of DrMTHase may play a similar role. Its close packing against the C-terminal side of the (b/a)8

barrel shields the largely hydrophobic Aa7 helix from the surrounding solvent and contributes to the stability of both the A and the D domains (Figure 2(c)). In addition, in both the DrMTHase­trehalose and DrMTHase­maltose complexes, disaccharides were found to interact with the C domain (Figure 5), suggesting that it may be acting as a non-catalytic saccharide-binding domain. In many glycosidases, similar small b-sheet domains have been shown to act in the same fashion.37­43

Divalent cation binding Most members of the glycosidase family 13 display a Ca2C-dependent activity and have been found to possess at least one high-affinity Ca2Cbinding site.18,19,21­23,30,35,44 This does not appear to be the case for ssMTHase21 and DrMTHase. However, a second lower-affinity Ca2C-binding site has been described that is located in the active site. 23,45 Electron density corresponding to a

11 makes contact with the entering sugar ring (Tre1), via the essential Trp241. As the chain moves down the channel, the long a-helix of domain E (Ea1) along with the loop from subdomain B close down on the sugar chain (mimicked by Mal3), thus trapping the substrate in the active site (Figures 4 and 5). Trp241 and Glu471 form a bridge over the catalytic residues and thus protect the active site from the surrounding solvent (Figures 4(a) and 5(b)). In a number of a-amylase-inhibitor structures,31,32,50 the sugar molecule bound at the active site is distorted and displays a kink between the K1 and C1 subsites. In DrMTHase, Trp241 and Glu471 may maintain the substrate in a strained conformation in the active site, thus lowering the energy barrier of hydrolysis.28 Subsites K2 and K3 show enhanced affinity for maltose relative to trehalose, suggesting that it stabilises the sugar chain with a-1,4-linkages, while allowing the trehalose moiety at the reducing end of the maltooligotrehaloside to enter the substrate recognition cleft. The position of the bound substrate in subsites K2 and K3 in DrMTHase-maltose (Mal3) is very similar to that observed in the crystal structures of Aspergillus oryzae a-amylase, porcine pancreatic a-amylase and cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase in complex with either acarbose or maltonanaose.29,35,51 The major difference is the initial pathway of the entering sugar chain, which in the case of DrMTHase is determined by the loop protruding from the B domain and the long Ea1-helix from domain E that overlooks the active site. In the a-amylase family, subdomain B is very irregular in structure and length,25 and subdomain E is missing entirely in most cases.29­32,35 The trapping of the long sugar chain within this entry channel may thus be a specificity of MTHase enzymes, since no large conformational change involving secondary structure elements has been described for glycosidase­ substrate complexes. The only movement upon substrate binding described previously was observed in porcine pancreatic a-amylase, where a flexible loop overhanging the C-terminal side of the (b/a)8 barrel moves to make contact with the sugar in the active site.51 Trehalose binding in the substrate recognition cleft The presence of trehalose (Tre2) in the C1 and C2 subsites of the DrMTHase­trehalose complex has allowed the identification of the residues involved in the selective binding of the a-1,1-linked sugar, trehalose, as opposed to other maltooligosaccharides. These crucial residues are located in the A and D domains. The sugar units in the C1 and C2 subsites are both recognised specifically by an extensive hydrogen-bonding network, in which many water molecules are also involved (Figure 3(c)). A majority of the residues involved in the specific recognition of the sugar ring in the C2 site are conserved within the family of MTHase enzymes (Figure 1(a)). Importantly, the His332 N32

partially occupied Mg2C was found at this position in the DrMTHase­maltose structure. Although there are subtle differences between these two divalent cations, Ca2C can often be replaced by Mg2C.46 In DrMTHase, the Mg2C is coordinated by Asp400 and Glu308, along with four well-ordered water molecules, which are in the same position in the structure of the apo form of DrMTHase. In Aspergillus niger a-amylase, the existence of this lower-affinity Ca2C-binding site located within the catalytic triad has been proposed to explain why a-amylase activity is affected by high levels of Ca2C in the reaction mixture.23 Similarly, the presence of Mg2C bound in the active site of DrMTHase, when complexed to its substrate, suggests that a mechanism involving divalent cations may also be regulating MTHase activity. Structural comparisons suggest that the position of this Mg2C coincides with that of the glycosidic oxygen atom of the sugar bond to be cleaved.31 Thus the binding of Mg2C in the active site of DrMTHase would most likely interfere (by competitive inhibition) with substrate binding within the catalytic triad and thus with hydrolysis. Substrate binding and conformational changes in DrMTHase All three inserted subdomains B, D and E within the (b/a)8 barrel of DrMTHase are essential for substrate binding. The substrates for MTHase are maltooligotrehalosides, which can be produced from very long oligosaccharides, the most abundant maltodextrin in nature being soluble starch. In Brevibacterium helvolum, MTSase and MTHase appear to be able to use long sugar chains as substrates, although the catalytic efficiency is increased by the addition of a-amylase that generates smaller sugar fragments.47 In DrMTHase, two channels are formed at the surface of the enzyme to bind long sugar chains, one leading down to the active site and another guiding the sugar molecules out again (Figure 5(a)). The entry channel can accommodate seven sugar rings in the K1 to K7 subsites, with hydrophobic stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding occurring at each of these sites. In the case of the outwards channel, the protein makes fewer specific contacts with the sugar rings beyond the substrate recognition cleft, allowing the product to be released efficiently. In both cases though, the major mode of protein­sugar interaction is mediated by aromatic residues stacking against the sugar rings. Notably, histidine and tyrosine residues are largely involved in stabilisation of protein­sugar interactions and in forming the steric barriers required to form the inwards and outwards channels. Such aromatic­ sugar stacking is a typical feature of protein­ carbohydrate interactions.44,48,49 The entry channel runs between subdomains B and E, and over the N-terminal side of the (b/a)8 barrel (Figure 5(b) and (c)). As the sugar chain enters the channel, the flexible loop of domain B

12 atom hydrogen-bonds directly to the O6 atoms of the two sugar units of the bound trehalose molecule. This interaction is specific for trehalose, since the presence of both O6 atoms at hydrogenbonding distance from His332 N32 could only occur with an a-1,1-linked disaccharide. Moreover, the finding that trehalose was bound at the C1 and C2 sites, but not maltose, while in both cases DrMTHase was co-crystallised with a high concentration of disaccharide, suggests that trehalose is the favoured substrate in the binding cleft. This preference for trehalose is most likely largely influenced by the hydrophobic stacking of both His310 and Tyr345 on the sugar ring at the C2 site. The stabilisation of the sugar ring between the two protein aromatic rings must greatly enhance the affinity for trehalose. In the DrMTHase­maltose complex, the maltose molecule (Mal1) bound at the C2 and C3 subsites is unable to form this double stacking interaction, due to its a-1,4-glycosidic bond, which alters the orientation of the sugar ring in the C2 subsite. These observations are in agreement with the activity measurements carried out on ssMTHase, which show that it can hydrolyse maltooligosaccharides to release maltose, but with a 16-fold lower activity.21,33 There is indeed no major steric hindrance that would disallow the binding of maltose in the substrate binding cleft (C1 and C2 subsites), but the particular conformation of trehalose at the reducing end of maltooligotrehalosides will be favoured because of its ability to form additional, stabilising interactions with His310 and Tyr345.

Materials and methods
Cloning, expression and purification of DrMTHase The cloning of the gene encoding DrMTHase (SwissProt: Q9RX51) was carried out by Protein'eXpert, Grenoble, France. The amplified gene was cloned into pDEST17 (Invitrogen) for expression with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Two extra residues, Thr431 and Leu432, that were missing from the sequence available in the public database were observed by DNA sequencing and were later confirmed as being present in the final structure. DrMTHase was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)Star (Invitrogen) after induction with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 25 8C. The cells were lysed with a cell disrupter and the soluble fraction was loaded on a 1 ml chelating Sepharose resin loaded with NiSO4 and pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. After three washes with increasing concentrations of imidazole (10 mM, 50 mM and 100 mM), the bound protein was eluted with 500 mM imidazole. The fractions containing DrMTHase were pooled and dialysed against 25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol. A fraction of the purified protein was separated by size-exclusion chromatography on an analytical Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) to ensure that the sample was homogeneous. Subsequently, the protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, prior to setting up crystallisation trials. For the preparation of seleno-methionine-substituted protein, the BL21(DE3)Star (Invitrogen) cells were grown in M9 medium until they reached an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.4. At this point, 100 mg of L-lysine, 100 mg of L-phenylalanine, 100 mg of L-threonine, 50 mg of L-isoleucine, 50 mg of L-leucine, 50 mg of L-valine and 60 mg of seleno-methionine were added to 1 l of culture and the cells were grown at 37 8C for a further one hour, before inducing the expression with 1 mM IPTG overnight at 25 8C. The protein was purified as described above and concentrated to 14 mg/ml. Both the native and the seleno-methionine-labelled proteins were subjected to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry analysis (at the Institut de Biologie Structurale, Grenoble) in order to estimate the efficiency of selenium incorporation (Table 3). Crystallisation and data collection DrMTHase was crystallised using the hanging-drop, vapour-diffusion method. Crystals were obtained in 18­25% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.5) and 0.05­0.2 M MgCl2. The larger crystals (600 mm! 150 mm!20 mm) used to collect the high-resolution data set were grown in the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol. The seleno-methionine-substituted protein was crystallised in the same conditions as the native protein. For the DrMTHase­trehalose and DrMTHase­maltose complexes, the seleno-methionine-substituted protein was used and crystallised in conditions similar to those used for the apo enzyme, but with either 25% (w/v) trehalose or 20% (w/v) maltose added to the mother liquor. In all cases, the crystals belong to the orthorhombic space

Conclusions
The three-dimensional crystal structures of DrMTHase in its apo form and in complex with both maltose and trehalose have revealed the mode of substrate recognition of DrMTHase. This is most likely shared by other members of the subfamily of MTHase enzymes, since most of the critical residues are conserved. Unlike other members of the glycosidase family 13, DrMTHase undergoes a significant conformational change upon substrate binding, guiding the sugar chain into the active site. The finding that DrMTHase binds Mg2C within the catalytic triad suggests that divalent cations may be involved in regulating its catalytic mechanism. The presence of this unusual trehalose synthesis pathway in the extreme radiation and desiccationresistant bacterium D. radiodurans suggests that this additional pathway may be essential, especially as the "classical" pathway involving trehalose phosphate synthase is missing. The rapid breakdown of the most widely available source of maltodextrins in nature, i.e. soluble starch, would be an efficient mechanism to produce trehalose rapidly in response to environmental stress. Further biochemical studies and the future results from ongoing genomics and proteomics projects will

The native crystals of the apo form were cryoprotected with 10% (v/v) glycerol, while 25% (w/v) trehalose or maltose was used for the crystals of the respective DrMTHase­sugar complexes. For all the crystals, data collection was carried out at 100 K under a nitrogen stream. All the data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. An initial data set was collected on a crystal of native ° DrMTHase to a resolution of 1.6 A on ID14-EH2 (data ° not shown). A high-resolution (1.1 A) data set was subsequently collected on a large crystal of native DrMTHase on ID29. For the structure determination, a SAD experiment was performed at the selenium absorption edge (EZ12.6593 keV) on ID29. Anomalous data to a ° resolution of 2.0 A were collected. A complete data set was collected on crystals of both the DrMTHase­trehalose and DrMTHase­maltose complexes to a resolution of ° ° 1.5 A and 1.2 A, respectively, on ID14-EH2. Further details are given in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The high-resolution data set was indexed, integrated and scaled using the XDS program,52 and converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE.53 All other data sets were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM,54 followed by scaling, merging and conversion of the intensities to structure factors using the CCP4 programs SCALA and TRUNCATE.53 An initial analysis using the program ° SOLVE55 with data to 2.0 A resolution revealed the positions of seven Se sites and allowed the determination of the correct hand of the Se atom substructure. Refine° ment of these sites and phase calculation to dminZ1.6 A was carried out using the program SHARP56 to yield a figure of merit (FOM) of 0.84, after solvent flattening procedures had been used to improve the initial experimental phases (Table 1). Subsequently, the autobuilding program ARP/wARP57 used this initial set of phases and amplitudes to build w95% of the protein model. After a single round of restrained refinement in Refmac5,58 this preliminary model was refined against ° the 1.1 A native data set, first as a rigid body then using restrained refinement interspersed with manual rebuilding and the addition of solvent molecules using the program O.59 Details of the model obtained along with refinement statistics are given in Table 2. This model of the apo enzyme was then used as a starting point for the refinement of the protein­sugar complexes. In both cases, sugar molecules were built into difference electron density maps and the refinement of the complexes was then carried out in the same fashion as for the apo enzyme (see Table 2). In all cases, the crystallographic R-factor and R-free (calculated from a test set constituted by 5% of the reflections) were monitored. The same set of R-free reflections (from the refinement of the apo form) was used for the refinement of the two DrMTHase­sugar complexes. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The atomic coordinates of DrMTHase alone and in complex with trehalose and maltose have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank60 with accession codes 2BHU, 2BHY and 2BHZ, respectively.
