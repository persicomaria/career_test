Integrin adhesion receptors constitute a cell-signaling system whereby interactions in the small cytoplasmic domains of the heterodimeric - and -subunits provoke major functional alterations in the large extracellular domains. With two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, we examined two synthetic peptides [ IIb(987MWKVGFFKRNR) and 3(716KLLITIHDRKEFAKFEEERARAKWD)] encompassing the membrane-proximal regions of the cytoplasmic domain motifs from the platelet integrin complex b 3. These membrane-proximal regions contain two conserved motifs, represented by 989KVGFFKR in the IIb-subunit, and 716KLLITIHDR in the 3-subunit. The dimer interaction consists of btwo adjacent helices with residues V990 and F993 of the subunit heavily implicated in the dimer interfacial region, as is I719 of 3. These residues are situated within the conserved motifs of their respective proteins. Further structural analysis of this unique peptide heterodimer suggests that two distinct conformers are present. The major structural difference between the two conformers is a bend in the 3-peptide between D723 and A728, whereas the helical character in the other regions remains intact. Earlier mutational analysis has shown that a salt bridge between b(R955) and 3(D723) is formed. When this the side chains of ion pair was modeled into both conformers, increased nuclear Overhauser effect violations suggested that the more bent structure was less able to accommodate this interaction. These results provide a molecular level rationalization for previously reported biochemical studies, as well as a basis for an atomic level understanding of the intermolecular interactions that regulate integrin activity.

ntegrins constitute a family of membrane-spanning proteins critical to maintaining tissue integrity in multicellular systems (1, 2). They have also been implicated in numerous cell-signaling processes, playing a key role in such diverse processes as hemostasis, inflammation, and wound healing (3, 4). Blood platelets possess a highly abundant system of integrin-mediated activation, and as such, platelet integrins have been well characterized at the biochemical level. Two hetero-protein domains are required for integrin function, and the b 3 heterodimer is unique to platelets. Resting b 3 has a low affinity for fibrinogen. However, after activation by an agonist, the b 3 complex switches to a high-affinity state, which causes platelets to aggregate into a hemostatic plug (5). Integrins possess large extracellular domains with relatively small C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (typically 20­70 aa). Recent publication of a crystal structure for the extracellular portion of V 3-integrin has greatly enhanced our understanding of this region (6). A single membrane-spanning region connects the intra- and extracellular regions. The cytoplasmic tails form a crucial part of the activation mechanism as demonstrated by previous mutation studies (7­10). These studies suggest that key to integrin signaling are the highly conserved K GFFKR and KLLvXiHDR motifs of the - and -cytoplasmic domains, respectively, where ``X'' is an unconserved residue, `` '' is a conserved apolar residue, ``i'' is either I, F, or L, and ``v'' is either V, I, or M. These sequences are positioned immediately proximal to the membrane, constituting the membrane­cytoplasm interface (Fig. 1). It has been demonstrated that a short lipid5878 ­5883 PNAS April 30, 2002 vol. 99 no. 9

modified peptide encompassing the conserved IIb sequence can specifically induce platelet activation (11). It is unclear at this point exactly how the cytoplasmic tails relay messages from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space, a process termed ``inside-out'' signaling (5, 12). Signaling can also proceed from the ``outside-in'' (3), making the integrin system truly bidirectional. Several studies with surface plasmon resonance (13), fluorescence resonance energy transfer and quenching, and circular dichroism (14) have found evidence for a direct interaction between the - and -cytoplasmic tails. Strong evidence reveals that this interaction is mediated, at least in part, by a salt bridge between b(R995) and 3(D723) (Fig. 1) (10). Mutation of either residue to Ala results in a constitutively active b 3 complex; however, cross-substitution of these residues to reverse the charge returns the system to rest. Finally, a mixture of the cytoplasmic integrin tails has been shown to elicit polyclonal antibodies not observed for each tail in isolation (15). Attempts at characterizing the membrane-proximal regions of both the b and 3 domains by NMR spectroscopy and theoretical methods have met with limited success (16­20). In a recent ingenious study, the membrane-proximal portion of the b domain was tethered to a micellar environment by a myristoyl group (18). The conserved GFFKR motif was -helical, and the C-terminal end of the domain folded back on this motif. Another NMR study used a coiled-coil construct to tether the b and 3 tails together, and although interaction between the two domains was not observed, it was found that the R724­A735 region of the 3-subunit had a propensity to form -helical secondary structures (20). These results provide a major step forward in understanding the molecular level interactions crucial to integrin activation. However, no structural information currently exists about the direct interactions between the b- and 3-cytoplasmic domains. In the present study, we used a mixture of two synthetic peptides of the membrane-proximal regions of the integrin cytoplasmic tails which were truncated at R997 in b and D740 in 3 (Fig. 1). With NMR spectroscopy, numerous contacts were observed between the highly conserved aliphatic residues in the N-terminal region of the 3-peptide and the aromatic residues in the conserved b(991-GFFKR) region, indicating dimerization. Moreover, two distinct conformers were observed, and analysis of the NMR spectra indicated that the major area of deviation between the two conformers occurs between residues 719 and 725 of the 3-subunit.

Structure Calculations. The CNS program (version 1.0) was used for initial structure calculations, with the default values for force constants (28). Distance restraints used in structure calculations were based on the observed intensities from the NOESY spectra. Initially, calibration was achieved on the basis of strong, medium, and weak characterization, corresponding to upper bounds of 2.8, 3.4, and 5.0 Å and a lower bound of 1.8 Å. Pseudoatom corrections were applied to nonstereospecifically assigned protons as described elsewhere (29). In addition, dihedral angle restraints of 35° to 175° were used for nonglycine residues based on accepted geometry. The simulated annealing protocol was initiated from a fully extended conformation for both peptide chains. Once structures showing convergence were achieved in CNS with no nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) violations 0.2 Å and no dihedral violations 5°, the restraint lists were separated into two to reflect two apparent isoforms in the data. The two structures were further refined independently by using the ambiguous restraints in iterative assignments (ARIA) extension to CNS (30), with the addition of ambiguous NOE data. The default parameters were used for ARIA with the exception that the `qmove' flag was set to on. This flag forces initially violated restraints to be reset to very weak restraints and reassessed for validity within the calibration. In the final two iterations, 100 structures were calculated, and the lowest-energy 20 were selected for the respective structure ensembles. Once unique structures were generated representing the information from the two isoforms, a salt bridge was incorporated by imposing a 3.0-Å upper bound restraint between b(R995) and 3(D723). This restraint was chosen based on generally accepted values because such salt bridges are not usually observed by means of NMR structure determination. The two structures which included the salt bridge were evaluated for likelihood of salt-bridge formation based on the overall energies and number of NOE violations as compared with the non-salt-bridged structural families. All final ensembles were evaluated by using AQUA 3.2 and PROCHECK 3.5 (31).

of the two conformers, which is, to our knowledge, the most detailed structural information for the dimer system to date. The two structures present a picture of integrin signaling in which the 3 (719­725) region acts as a hinge converting between helical and nonhelical conformations, possibly accounting for the switch-like behavior exhibited by platelet integrin. Because the key residues involved in the dimer interface and conformational switch are highly conserved within the integrin family, this mechanism may be more generally applicable. Materials and Methods Peptides. Peptides encompassing the membrane-proximal regions of platelet integrin b(987 Ac-MWKVGFFKRNR-NH2 997) and 3(716 Ac-KLLITIHDRKEFAKFEEERARAKWDNH2 740) were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility, Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada, headed by G. Lajoie. These sequences were selected to include a single Trp residue for quantitation, and truncated to reduce overlap in the 1H NMR spectra. Purity was judged to be 95% from high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Quantitation of the peptides was achieved by UV spectroscopy, with an extinction coefficient of 5,500 M 1 cm 1 at 280 nm for each peptide, corresponding to the single Trp residue. mixture was prepared by mixing the b- and 3-peptides at 2 mM in a 1:1 ratio, pH 5.2 (unbuffered) in 450 l final volume. Solvent exchange to a 100% D2O solution was accomplished by lyophilizing the H2O sample to apparent dryness and then redissolving the sample in 450 l D2O. The pH was adjusted to 5.2, if necessary, without correction for any isotope effects. This pH was chosen to minimize the exchange rates for the amide protons (21), as is standard in the NMR analysis of small peptides and similar to the pH in previous integrin peptide structure determination (18). The addition of salt caused visible precipitation, and hence, low ionic strength conditions were used. Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (22) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) (23) NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX-500 instrument by using WATERGATE (24) for water suppression at 25°C. These spectra were acquired with an initial size of 2k 1k real and imaginary points. These spectra were zero-filled to a final size of 4k 2k by using NMRpipe (25) and analyzed by using NMRVIEW v. 4.1.3 (26). Because of extensive overlap in the spectra, the same NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Unity Inova 800 MHz instrument spectra, and the spectra were processed to the same final size. The proton chemical shift assignment was conducted by the methods initially described by Wuthrich (21). Final ¨ spectral assignments and calibration for structure calculations

Results The two peptides chosen for this study, b (987­997) and 3 (717­740), represent the membrane-proximal regions of both proteins (Fig. 1). Because the peptides represent portions of larger proteins, N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal NH2 groups were added to eliminate the terminal charges. Both peptides are void of membrane-distal motifs, which are thought to play a role in integrin regulation: b(R997­D1003) (15) and 3(N744­ Y747) (32). Both peptides showed little significant secondary structure in aqueous solution alone, as reported (14, 17, 20). However, under the conditions used in this study, a mixture of the two peptides demonstrated numerous clear helical dNN(i,i 1), d N(i,i 3), and d (i,i 3) NOEs for b(K989­N996), clearly indicating that this chain is an -helix (Fig. 2). Helical structure has been reported for this portion of the b sequence in 45% trifluoroethanol (17), when attached to micelles by way of lipidation (18), and when attached to a helical construct with the absence of any linker (20). In the current construct, the formation of secondary structure is favored by intermolecular contacts, as evidenced by unambiguous interchain NOEs present from the side chains of W988, V990, F992, and F993 of the b peptide to I719, T720, and I721 of the 3-chain.

Fig. 2. Homonuclear 1H NOESY spectrum at 500 MHz of the amide-amide region. This experiment provides through-space correlation of protons within 5­ 6 Å. The NOEs labeled are indicative of strong helical structure for the b peptide. Note that potential correlations for b (989 990, 992 993, and 993 994) are obscured by the diagonal. The remaining peaks show helical propensity of the 3-peptide, although ambiguity and conformational exchange make this analysis more difficult. Note the difference in intensity for the IIb peaks (with labels), and the remaining 3 peaks.

(Fig. 3). The presence of these conformers is unusual given that the system in question consists of two relatively short peptide chains (11 and 25 aa) with no Pro or Cys residues, and any conformational exchange would be expected to be rapid. A near-complete assignment of both conformers was obtained from the spectra at 800 MHz. The most evident conformational difference was later localized to a specific region of the 3peptide backbone. This region showing the greatest chemical shift differences, 3(719­725), encompasses 3(D723), which is implicated in a charged interaction with b(R995) (10). Analysis of the 3 NOEs was much less trivial than that of the b because of these conformation differences and weaker NOE peaks. Nonetheless, helical NOEs were clearly observed for the 3-peptide (Fig. 2), which is consistent with modeled data (16) and NMR analysis (20). The latter study demonstrated that the region R724­A735 had helical propensity, and that the membrane-proximal region also formed an -helix when stabilized by helix propagation. In our study, interchain contacts are apparent in the 3-membrane-proximal region L717­D723, presumably reducing flexibility and increasing the manifestation of the intrinsic helical character in this region. conformational exchange as discussed above, we proceeded with the structural characterization of two conformers from the b 3-peptide complex independently. Once reasonable convergence was achieved with the major NOEs common to both models, the divergent backbone NOEs were easily distinguished in both the H2O and D2O spectra, but side-chain chemical shift differences were much less obvious because of overlap and weak intensities. As a result, all ambiguous side-chain NOEs were included resulting in a relatively large number of NOEs (Table 1), and violated NOEs were excluded by ARIA in the final calculations. In addition, some intrapeptide NOE intensities for b-peptide were very intense for certain aliphatic residues the (e.g., M987 and V990) and were also violated in the ARIA calibration routine.

Both of these cases demonstrate the slow exchange which results in the conclusion that two distinct conformers exist in solution for the 3-peptide. In A, the conformation of the His residue on the downfield (Left) side participates in some type of helical secondary structure as evidenced by the dNN NOEs, which corresponds to structure b 3-2 in the current study. Also notice that although both His conformations show strong NOEs with the H from 3(I721) (Insert), only the downfield conformation has a strong intraresidue HN-H NOE. In B, the -proton region is shown, with the downfield conformation suggesting two protons with near-degenerate chemical shifts, whereas the protons in the upfield conformation exhibit distinct chemical shifts.

presents summary statistics for both. Conformational differences and violated NOE patterns suggest a view of a dynamic system, and the structures calculated are most likely average representatives of an ensemble of states. Inclusion of NOEs from these mixed states may lead to an ``overconvergence'' of the data into an unrealistically tight set of structures as demonstrated by the surprisingly small rms deviation values (Table 1). Despite this caveat, it is still clear that structures provide a picture of heterodimeric interaction that is consistent with the NOE data. b- and 3-chains Fig. 3 shows that in both conformers, the demonstrate significant helical character. Significant hydrophobic interactions occur between b(V990, F993) and 3(L717­ I21), which are critical residues of the dimer interface (Fig. 4). The reported structure of a membrane-anchored lipidated b cytoplasmic tail also demonstrated that V990 and F993 form a hydrophobic interaction surface, with F992 on the opposite side of the helix (18). It is not surprising that the F993 region is implicated in dimerization considering that the GFFKR motif is highly conserved in the integrin family. Unambiguous NOEs were observed between the b(F992) side chain and 3(I719), but these were weak, and F992 does not seem to be as central to the dimer interface as V990 and F993. Although the b-peptide maintains a helical conformation with one major helical turn in both structures, the divergence is significant in the backbone conformation of the 3-peptide, as expected from the NOE data (Fig. 2). In both cases, helical propensity is clearly displayed between residues K716­I721 and K729­W739. Particularly interesting is the contrast between the two structures in the region D723 to A728. In the b 3-2 conformer, this region is somewhat helical, so that the entire 3-peptide adopts an elongated and primarily helical structure. On the other hand, in the b 3-1 model, the D723­A728

region is clearly not helical and bends back toward the membrane-proximal region, causing the 3-peptide to close in an ``L''-like form as shown in Fig. 5. The D723­A728 sequence can be seen as a hinge region in the complex, allowing movement of the two helical areas of 3 with respect to each other. One consequence of the variability in the 3-hinge region is the rearrangement of the b-peptide with respect to the 3-membrane-proximal region (Fig. 6). In the structures we have calculated, the C-terminal tail of the 3-peptide folds back b-peptide in the b 3-1 conformer causing this toward the displacement (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6B shows that this movement causes b peptide to be slightly displaced, although it maintains the the same structure (Fig. 6B). Not represented in either structure is NOE evidence suggesting that the closure of the 3-peptide may be even greater than what is represented in conformer b 3-1. There were two unambiguous intrachain long-range NOEs unsatisfied in either structure observed between the side chain of 3(W739) and 3(I719), which would necessitate a more extreme turn than exists in IIb 3-1. These long-range 3b, or intrapeptide NOEs suggest a complete displacement of at least a more serious rearrangement of the dimer complex, although it was not possible to establish how the IIb-peptide would have to be displaced by the results of the current study. The fact that these NOEs were unsatisfied further underscores the fact that the system is dynamic, and many of the observed dimer contacts may be transitory. In other words, the IIb 3-1 conformation may be the average of an extended and a fully closed state. Nevertheless, each conformer model is likely representative of an ensemble of states.

b(R995)­ 3(D723) Salt Bridge. Because chargeswapping mutational analysis suggests that interactions between b(R995) and 3(D723) residues are the highly conserved critical to integrin function (10), we examined the effect of this ionic interaction on our models. NOE evidence was not apparent in our spectra to support such an interaction, although this is expected given the 5­6 Å upper limit in observable proton NOEs. As a result, we incorporated a restraint for the ionic interaction in the proposed salt bridge into both conformers. In b(R995) moved from a solventboth cases the side chain of exposed state to the bridged state, with a minor readjustment of b peptide (not shown).

The remaining unsatisfied restraints were either intrachain b restraints (totaling 12) or ambiguous (totaling 2). The fact that these are primarily from the b peptide is understandable, given that peak intensities for the 3-peptide are dispersed between at least two conformations.

C trace of the average calculated structure based on the ensemble of 20 lowest-energy structures for the IIb 3-peptide complex in this study: (A) b 3-1; (B) b 3-2; and (C) b 3-2 with salt-bridge constraint (stereo image). In all structures, the b-peptide forms a single-turn helix, whereas the 3-peptide has significant helical character. Also common to the structures are significant interactions between the side-chain moieties of b(V990, F993) with the aliphatic 3(I719) residue. A significant difference exists in the 3 chain; however, as in b 3-1 a bend between residues D723 and A728 forces the C-terminal tail closer to the N terminus, creating an ``L''-like shape. This may be a determining factor in the movement of the b-peptide, as shown in Fig. 6.

NOEs to be disproportionately large. It is worth noting, however, that all interchain and 3-NOEs are satisfied between the three structures: b 3-1, b 3-2, and b 3-2 with a salt-bridge constraint, with the exception of the long-range 3 restraint mentioned above (W739­I719). Discussion One of the key features of the integrin cell-signaling system is the on-off mechanism of activation. The structures presented here strongly support the conclusion that this on-off mechanism is mediated by direct interaction between the conserved residues in the membrane-proximal portion of the cytoplasmic tails of the b and 3 domains. The current study shows that the membrane-proximal region of 3 forms an -helix, much like that of b (17, 18), suggesting that these sequences form rigid continuations of the transmembrane helices. Glycosylation studies indeed suggest that the C-terminal end of the transmembrane segment of the integrin subunits extend into what is traditionally viewed as the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domains (33). Thus, the suggestion that the rearrangement necessary to find stable helix-interacting states (or a complete separation of the helices) can translate through the membranespanning regions to cause a global shift in the extracellular domains is quite reasonable. b 3-dimer interface are V990 and The key residues in the b and I719 from 3, indicating a predominantly F993 from b(F993) is a key residue in forming hydrophobic interaction. the hydrophobic patch in the dimer, and enough contacts exists to provide a well-defined picture of the dimer interface. In a b-cytoplasmic domain, the previously solved structure of the 11 residues at the C terminus were found to fold back and interact with the helical N-terminal portion of the peptide (18), and several long-range NOEs to F993 were observed. For the b 3 dimer to form, the C-terminal portion of the b tail may need to be displaced. Stabilization of the closed conformab-peptide may partially explain why other tion in full-length groups have not been able to observe dimerization in their NMR experiments. In addition, all of the interchain NOEs evident

The orientation of the complex in A is the same as in Fig. 4 with a 90° rotation, and B shows the displacement of the IIb-peptide. In the b 3-1 model, the C-terminal tail from 3 wraps back on the rest of the complex, presumably forcing the b peptide to twist slightly, although it maintains essentially the same structure.

from our work involved methyl and aromatic side-chain protons, which would not have been considered in the 15N-edited spectra considered by other recent NMR analyses (19, 20). The translation of the IIb-peptide with respect to the 3peptide between the two conformers of this study suggests that the hydrophobic patch is large or flexible enough to accommodate such a motion. It is not surprising then that the samples displayed marked salt-dependent aggregation not seen under similar conditions with either peptide in isolation, and low ionic strength conditions were required for the complex. Presumably, in vivo the presence of the remainder of the integrin subunits, membrane proximity, and or other protein interactions mitigate these aggregation effects. Further work needs to be done to characterize the residues involved in this aggregation to establish the physiological consequences of this result. b- and 3The structural similarities between the cytoplasmic tails extend beyond the helical membrane proximal regions. Both are immediately followed by a flexible hinge: 998PPLEED in b and 723DRKEFA in 3. (The presence of multiple charged residues in the 3-hinge suggests that its conformation may be very sensitive to ionic interactions.) This flexibility creates a conformational switch, allowing C-terminal regulatory sequences to be brought into close proximity of the membrane proximal region. For a double mutant peptide b(P998A, P999A) which did not fold back on itself, the of b 3 system was fixed in a constitutively active state (18).
Weljie et al.

Both b- and 3-cytoplasmic domains interact with cytosolic proteins which seem to bind sequences on both sides of the flexible hinge region. This seems to be true of calcium- and integrin-binding protein, a calmodulin-like protein (18, 34). 3-Endonexin requires both the membrane proximal sequence and 756NITY for binding (35), whereas talin seems to require both the membrane-proximal sequence (36) and 744NPLY (20) for binding. The binding pattern of these proteins suggests that the NITY and NPLY sequences are able to fold into close proximity of the membrane-proximal region. The 3-hinge region plays a key role in determining the nature of the membrane-proximal b 3 interface, which in turn likely determines the activation state of the b 3 system. In the current study, the experimental system seems to be teetering between two major states, although the exact physiological relevance of the two states is unclear. We propose that the b 3-2 conformer, which is more amenable to the intermolecular b(R995)­ 3(D723) salt bridge, corresponds to the resting low-affinity state. We suggest that the b 3-1 conformer (or a more bent form in which the b-subunit is further displaced) is representative of the activated high-affinity state.

This suggestion is consistent with two recent studies which indicate that the inactive form is based on a coiled-coil interaction (37), and that spatial separation of the two membraneproximal regions leads to activation (38). Such activation might correspond to either a ``piston'' or ``twist'' model of inside-out signaling as outlined by Ginsberg and coworkers (39). Clearly, more detailed structural analysis involving mutants would be helpful. As well, it is still far from clear what roles the membranedistal regions of both cytoplasmic tails play in this balancing act, and how they are affected by the plethora of cytoplasmic integrin-binding proteins identified thus far.
