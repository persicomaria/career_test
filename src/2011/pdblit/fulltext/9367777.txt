Abstract Mice immunizedwith purified antigenpreparations nroduced in Escherichia coli and containina the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) isoenzyme Syhistoof soma japonicum (Sj26) can be partially resistantto infection with this parasite.Maximum resistance was approximately50%andno protectionwasobtainedin BALB/c mice, known low respondersto Sj26. Although only Freund'scompleteadjuvant hasbeen used, the data obtained indicate that satisfactory levelsof resistance S. japonicum will not be attained to by vaccination with Sj26 alone. Other antigens, includina the additionalGST isoenzvme S. iafxmiof cum Sj28, will probably be required to establish whether Sj26 will be an important componentof a defined multivalent vaccine against schistosomiasis japonica. Introduction Whilst most mousestrainsare entirely permissive to infection with Philippine isolatesof Schistosoma japonicum, one strains(heredesignated WEHI 129/J) is peculiarin that a high proportion of micecontainno worms several weeks after exposure to cercariae (GARCIA al., 1983).The searchfor any immunoloet gical reasons why thesemice are resistanthasuncovered a elutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzvme of M, 26 O&j from adult wormsthat is n&icular~v well recognizedby serafrom suchmice(MITCHELL-et al., 1984.1985:SMITHet al.. 1986:DAVERN al.. 1987). et This'antigen(Sj26) is now availablein several forms: (a) a near-nativemoleculepurified from extracts of recombinantEscherichia coli by affinity chromatography on glutathione-conjugated agarose (SMITHet al., 1988), (b) fusion proteins involving Sj26 and a multitude~ofother sequences a rest& of the useof as DGEX (Glutaeene)vectors exnressed E. coli and in purified\ on g&a&one-agaros'e(SMITH& JOHNSON, 1988),(c) the original P-galactosidase fusion protein of Sj26expressed E. coli from a )igtl l-amp3 adult in worm cDNA library (SMITHet al., 1986), and (d) a mixture of Sj26andanotherglutathione-binding GST isoenzyme M, 28 000(Sj28)purified from aqueous of extractsof adult wormsand termedSiGST(TIIJ eral..

In the seriesof studiesreported here, mice of various geuotypes wereimmunizedin Melbourne, coded,and

The resultsindicate that a variabledegree of resistance be induced in somestrainsof mice can using E. coliderived antigens containing Sj26 in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), but that the protective effect is inconsistentand, at best, 50%.

Philippine isolates S. japonicum (Mindoro and of Sorsogon) were maintainedin Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi snailsas well asmice and rabbits in either Manila (GARCIA al., 1981)or Melbourne (WRIGHT et et al., 1988a)or collected from wild snailsin the Philippines.Anaesthetized micewereexposed 20 to to 25viable cercariae obtainedfrom crushedsnails using a standard cover slip method and worm burdens determinedmore than 4 weeks(usually between30 and40 d) after cercarial infection by portal perfusion. Worm numbers were expressedas the arithmetic mean + standard error of the mean (SEM) and differencesbetween groupsanalysed usingthe MannWhitney U statistic.
Immunization

Antigens in mouse tonicity phosphate-buffered saline.OH 7.3. (PBS) wereemulsified FCA (Difco in Laboraiories, `Michigan, USA) in a 1:l ratio and injected into mice both intraperitoneally (ip) and subcutaneously in a volume of less (SC) than 0.5 ml, the bulk of the injection being given by the latter route on the dorsumof the mouse.At least3 weeks later, an aqueous boost wasadministeredinto both sitesfollowed by another aqueous booster injection usuallyabout4 weeksafter the 6rst boost.Mice were bled at intervals and serum stored, and the earnumbered mice transported to Manila for percutaneouscercarial challenge.The time of challenge after the last injection was not lessthan 4 weeks.
