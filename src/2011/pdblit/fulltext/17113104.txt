A heme-acquisition system present in several Gram-negative bacteria requires the secretion of hemophores. These extracellular carrier proteins capture heme and deliver it to specific outer membrane receptors. The Serratia marcescens HasA hemophore is a monodomain protein that binds heme with a very high affinity. Its / structure, as that of its binding pocket, has no common features with other iron- or heme-binding proteins. Heme is held by two loops L1 and L2 and coordinated to iron by an unusual ligand pair, H32/Y75. Two independent regions of the hemophore -sheet are involved in HasA­HasR receptor interaction. Here, we report the 3-D NMR structure of apoHasA and the backbone dynamics of both loaded and unloaded hemophore. While the overall structure of HasA is very similar in the apo and holo forms, the hemophore presents a transition from an open to a closed form upon ligand binding, through a large movement, of up to 30 Å, of loop L1 bearing H32. Comparison of loaded and unloaded HasA dynamics on different time scales reveals striking flexibility changes in the binding pocket. We propose a mechanism by which these structural and dynamic features provide the dual function of heme binding and release to the HasR receptor.

Introduction
Iron plays a key role in a wide range of metabolic and signalling functions and is therefore an essential compound for cells. However, its ferric form is hardly soluble and its ferrous form is highly toxic. Thus, in biological fluids, most of the iron is sequestered in iron- or heme-binding proteins and the level of free iron remains low, making iron acquisition a challenge for pathogenic bacteria.

Heme is a major iron source and its uptake is a common approach used by pathogenic bacteria to get their iron supplies. One heme-acquisition system relies on specific outer membrane receptors for heme and heme-binding proteins such as hemoglobin, hemopexin and albumin whereby heme is internalized.1 Another strategy, developed by several Gram-negative bacteria to scavenge heme from their host, relies on the secretion into the extracellular medium of heme-carrier proteins or hemophores HasA. These proteins uptake heme, free or bound to hemoproteins, and return it to specific outer membrane receptors HasR, which in turn release it to the bacteria.2 HasA from Serratia marcescens was the first hemophore to be discovered.3 It is a 19-kDa monomer that binds one ferric b heme molecule with very high affinity: Ka = 5.3 × 1010 M- 1.4 The crystal structure of

518 the heme-loaded protein shows an original + fold, with a seven-stranded antiparallel -sheet on one side of the protein and four -helices on the other side5 (Fig. 1a). The heme-binding site is mainly composed of two extended loops, L1 and L2, that connect the  and  faces of the molecule. The heme iron is bound by an unusual pair of ligands: a histidine (H32) on loop L1 and a tyrosine (Y75) on loop L2. A third residue, H83, plays an important role in heme binding. It stabilizes the tyrosinate form of Y75 through a hydrogen bond via its N1 and strengthens the Y75­iron coordination bond, making Y75 a stronger ligand than H32.4,6,7 Both apo- and holoHasA bind to the receptor HasR with the same apparent affinity (Ka = 2 × 108 M- 1).8 Binding is a protein-protein interaction that does not involve heme but two regions of the hemophore -sheet. Whereas the HasA­HasR interaction and the heme transfer are not energy-driven processes, the release of the empty hemophore relies on the energy provided by the inner membrane complex TonB­ExbB­ExbD.9 The cascade of events allowing the bacteria to scavenge iron from their host, that is, heme uptake by the hemophore, recognition of the receptor, heme transfer and release of the empty hemophore, is not precisely known. The relationship between the structural and dynamic properties of both apo- and holoHasA is of particular interest for a mechanistic analysis of the whole system. Here, we first report the 3-D structure of apoHasA in solution determined by heteronuclear 15N­13C­1H NMR spectroscopy. We show that upon heme binding, a large conformational change affects the loop L1, switching the binding pocket from a wide open to a closed form. We then analyze the backbone dynamics of both loaded and unloaded HasA by means of 15N relaxation measurements, using diamagnetic gallium protoporphyrin IX (GaPPIX) to load the hemophore and to avoid relaxation effects induced by the iron(III) paramagnetism.10 Our study represents the first report on the dynamics of a heme carrier protein in the two states, loaded and unloaded. Together with

the structural analysis, it provides acute insights into the heme binding and heme release processes. Heme binding is shown to occur through an induced-fit mechanism via loop L1. The plasticity of the heme pocket, through loop L1 in unloaded HasA and loop L2 in loaded HasA, is proposed to drive the heme capture and release, respectively.

Results
Structure calculation of apoHasA Nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) crosspeaks (6845) were picked in both 3-D 13C and 15N edited 1H­1H NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra. Restraints used to calculate the apoHasA structures at the end of the assignment and structure calculation procedures included 3345 distances (3000 unambiguous and 345 ambiguous), 111  torsion angles, and 34 hydrogen bonds (Table 1). The backbone hydrogen bond restraints were implemented to reinforce canonical secondary structures based on characteristic NOE patterns and chemical shift indexes. Two hundred manually assigned longrange NOEs were also included in the structure calculation. A floating chirality approach was used during the structure calculation. The 10 lowestenergy structures were selected to yield the final structural ensemble representing the result of the NMR structure determination (Fig. 2). The resolution is high, consistent with the large number of unambiguous distance restraints per residue (average, 17). Parameters defining the quality of the structures in terms of restraint violation and deviation from ideal geometry are summed up in Table 1. Distance violations larger than 0.5 Å are scarce and the covalent geometry is respected, as evidenced by the low RMSD values for bond lengths and valence angles. PROCHECK analysis of the ensemble of structures gives 98% of the backbone angles in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and 74% in the most favoured. The final ensemble of tertiary

519 four -helices packed on one face and a sevenstranded antiparallel -sheet presenting a high degree of curvature on the other face (Fig. 1b and c). The average pairwise RMSD for residues involved in the secondary structures is 1.01 Å between the apo and the holo forms. The heme-binding site of apoHasA presents a large conformational change as compared to holoHasA: whereas the heme pocket adopts a closed form in the holoprotein, it is widely open in the absence of ligand. In fact, in apoHasA, loop L1, encompassing residues D29 to F45 and bearing the iron-coordinated histidine H32, is shifted by up to 30 Å (N34 and G35 C) and folds onto the protein core. The two hinge regions consist of residues T26, F27 and G28 at the end of helix H1 and of the three C-terminal residues of the loop, G43, G44 and F45. The position of the loop is well defined with 68 distance restraints between the loop (residues D29 to F45) and the protein core: strands 3 (residues A56, I57, S58), 5 (residues D96, G97, L98, S99, G101), 6 (residues Y106, Q109, V110) and the hairpin connecting strands 3 and 4 (residues A61, N62, V64). Loop L2 (residues N72 to T84), bearing the second axial ligand Y75 in holoHasA, as well as the bottom of the heme-binding pocket, displays a very similar conformation in the bound and unbound forms. As for holoHasA, the last five residues V175­H179 following the C-terminal -helix are largely unstructured in apoHasA. Dynamics analysis GaPPIX­HasA was used as loaded protein. Indeed, a set of experimental data using different approaches has previously shown that both GaPPIX­HasA and FePPIX­HasA complex structures are similar, notably the topology of the ligand pocket emphasizing that the GaPPIX­HasA can be used as a diamagnetic model for holoHasA.6,7,10 Relaxation data As monitored by dynamic light scattering assays, no aggregation was observed in the GaPPIX­HasA sample at a concentration of 1 mM, whereas a small aggregation (about 5%) was observed for apoHasA at the same concentration, affecting the R1, R2 and NOE values. Therefore, relaxation data were recorded at a lower concentration, i.e., 0.1 mM, for which no aggregation was detected. 15N relaxation parameters, R1, R2 and NOE, were obtained for 139

Mean values for 15N R1, 15N R2 and 15N NOE{1H} are 2.02 ± 0.16, 10.35 ± 1.46 and 0.81 ± 0.08, for apoHasA and 1.96 ± 0.14, 11.09 ± 1.31 and 0.73 ± 0.05 for GaPPIX­HasA, respectively. The standard and extended model-free formalisms of Lipari­Szabo were used to analyze the 15 N relaxation data.11­13 The main components of the inertia tensors were calculated from the apo- and holoHasA structures. Diffusion anisotropy converged to a D///D ratio of 1.159 for apoHasA and of 1.248 for holoHasA. Using an axial diffusion tensor offered only a slightly better fit of the data than the fully isotropic tensor, while a fully anisotropic model did not improve the fit.14,15 The overall correlation times r of the two proteins at 30 °C are 7.57 ± 0.05 ns for apoHasA and 8.27 ± 0.03 ns for GaPPIX­HasA.16 Modelfree analyses The models of motion used by Modelfree correctly describe the data obtained for 133 residues of apoHasA and 142 residues of GaPPIX­HasA. Relaxation data for 121 and 140 backbone 15N nuclear spins of apo and GaPPIX­HasA, respectively, were fitted using the model with a single internal correlation time (S 2 ,  e , R 2ex ). The extended model taking into account two types of internal motions occurring on different time scales, slow and fast, was used for 12 residues of apoHasA (S3, Y6 in strand 1;V36, T37, D38, N40 and G42 in loop L1;V63 in strand 4; L97 between 5 and 6 strands; Q125 in the loop connecting strand 7 and helix H2; A170 and A173 in helix H4) and for 2 residues of GaPPIX­HasA (L123 and V177). Relaxation data for 6 residues of apoHasA and for 6 residues of GaPPIX­HasA could not be correctly fitted by the simple or extended modelfree models. The assumption e b r underlying the model-free treatment was violated and these residues display apparently negative exchange contribution, R2ex or S2 N 1. These results may be due to the contribution of internal motions on a time scale of 10- 8 to 10- 3 s to the relaxation processes. Generalized order parameter S2 Amplitudes of picosecond to nanosecond time scale HN motions for the apoHasA and GaPPIX­ HasA are displayed in Fig. 3. The mean values of S2 are similar and high for the two proteins, 0.90, indicating an overall rigid structure for both forms of the proteins. The S2 amplitudes of the loaded and unloaded proteins display comparable variations along the sequence except for two regions: order parameters are particularly low (S2 b 0.70) for residues D39 to G43 of loop L1 in apoHasA, where high S2 values are observed all over the loop in GaPPIX­ HasA, while the loop encompassing residues L123 to G130 and the following helix H2 (V131­S141) display lower S2 values in GaPPIX­HasA.

Internal correlation time e Apo and GaPPIX­HasA exhibit significant nanosecond time scale motions. However, in GaPPIX­ HasA, e values are generally higher and more residues are concerned by such dynamics. In apoHasA, 17 residues display e values higher than 500 ps (Fig. 4a). They are distributed all along the sequence: S4, Y7 in strand 1 and S9, F11 between strand 1 and helix H1; N36, T38, D39, N41 and G43 in loop L1; L98 and S104 between strands 5 and 6; Q124, A125, Q126, G127 in the loop connecting strand 7 and helix H2, A146 in helix H3 and A171 in helix H4. In GaPPIX­HasA, 41 residues display values higher than 500 ps (Fig. 4b): S9 to S15 between strand 1 and helix H1; H17 to Y19 in helix H1; N31, D39, G43 in loop L1; G47, S51, G52, S53, T65, Y75, L85, S122, L123, Q124, A125, Q126, G127, G130 in the curved part of the -sheet; Y137 to S141 in helix H2; G145, L147 and I154 in helix H3; S161, V162, S164 in loop connecting helices H3 and H4; D167, A170 and A174 in helix H4. Exchange contribution R2ex Apo and GaPPIX­HasA both display microsecond to millisecond time scale motions, although this contribution to transverse relaxation of these motions is more important in the holoform. Two residues in apoHasA display R2ex values higher than 3 Hz (Fig. 5a): S51 and G52 in the curved part of strands 2 and 3. Seven additional residues exhibit R2ex values higher than 1.5 Hz: D8 in strand 1; F45 in strand 2; L77 and E80 in loop L2, S93 in strand 3, I154 in helix H3 and S161 between helices H3 and H4. In GaPPIX­HasA, five residues exhibit R2ex values higher than 3 Hz (Fig. 5b): G52, D96, S114, F115 in the -sheet and G130 in helix H2. Twelve residues display R2ex values between 2 and 3 Hz: S10 in the

Discussion
Proteins that bind, transport, and release iron or heme, such as transferrins, hemopexin, FbpA and HemS, usually consist of two domains connected by a flexible linker region acting as a hinge between the two domains.17,18 It has been proposed that ligand binding induces the transition from a flexible, open form of the two domains to their tight association in a closed form. This was recently demonstrated for HemS, the only other heme carrier structurally characterized in both loaded and unloaded states.19 In this respect, HasA is an original heme carrier: first, it is a monodomain protein and its structure, including that of its binding pocket, has no common feature with other iron- or heme-binding proteins; second, it presents a transition from an open to a closed form upon ligand binding through a large

movement, of up to 30 Å, of the functional loop L1 bearing one of its axial ligands, H32. There is no precedent of a motion as large as the one observed in HasA in other heme-binding proteins. Such large loop displacement has been mainly characterized in enzymes such as triosephosphate isomerase (up to 8 Å), enolase (up to 8 Å), lipase (up to 12 Å) and -1,4-galactosyltransferase (up to 20 Å) and was shown to be critical for the protein function.20­22 Apart from loop L1, the structure of HasA is very similar in the apo and holo forms. The original / architecture of the protein is independent of the heme presence in the binding pocket and, thus, opening or closing of loop L1 does not trigger conformational changes, propagating the information that heme is bound or not. Conformational and dynamic changes upon heme binding Loop L1 and the remaining part of the heme pocket behave differently in terms of structure and dynamics in apo- and holoHasA. Whereas loop L1 undergoes a large conformational change and

522 becomes more rigid on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale upon ligand binding, loop L2, loop S122­G130, hairpin G48­S53 and helix H2 maintain the same structure and become more flexible on the nanosecond time scale. Thus, the dynamic behaviors of loops L1 and L2 lead to opposing, positive and negative conformational entropy contributions. Such entropy compensation upon ligand binding has been described in other systems.23 Loop L1 adopts a single and well-defined conformation in apoHasA. No significant contribution of exchange processes was observed, precluding therefore a slow equilibrium between an open and a closed conformer. Nevertheless, its region T38­G43 proves to be the most flexible one of the apoprotein, with motions on two time scales, subnanosecond and nanosecond, suggesting the presence of an ensemble of conformers in rapid equilibrium with a lowenergy barrier.24 Consistently, backbone RMSDs greater than 1 Å are observed in this region. NMR dynamics parameters of GaPPIX­HasA and crystallographic B-factors of FePPIX-HasA (PDB code 1B2V) show that in loaded HasA, loop L1 is rigid. Stabilization of its closed state is mainly achieved by interactions with the heme molecule: the semipolar bond between H32 and the iron together with the two hydrogen bonds between N34, and G35 and the heme propionate groups. The few interactions between loop L1 and the remaining part of the binding pocket are not sufficient to ensure the stable closed conformation of the holoprotein in the absence of heme. The structure of loop L2 and of its flanking regions is similar in apo- and holoHasA. Indeed, the large number of polar and hydrophobic interactions between the loop and nearby residues is sufficient to constrain their conformation in the unloaded as in the loaded protein. Nevertheless, this part of the pocket exhibits enhanced motions on the nanosecond time scale in the loaded protein, consistent

Structural and Dynamics Properties of HasA

with the high B-factors observed for the three crystal forms of holoHasA (Fig. 6). In addition, residues F78 and E80 in loop L2 and residues of strand 3 (G52, Y55 and S58) display slow motions on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. As discussed below, this dynamic behavior may play a role in the heme release. Previous studies have shown that the interaction between HasA, in the apo as well as in the holo form, and its receptor HasR is a protein­ protein interaction with a Kd of a few nanomolar, involving two independent regions of the -sheet: S51­T60 and G95­S107.8 The first region, including the whole 3 strand, is largely subjected to microsecond to millisecond time scale motions, notably in apoHasA. The second region, including part of strands 5 and 6, does not display slow motions but is flexible on the fast time scale in the two forms of HasA. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 6, it displays the highest RMSD and B-factor values among the entire group of proteins. Thus, the two regions involved in the HasA­HasR interaction are highly mobile in both apo and holo forms of HasA. This result is consistent with the observation that regions at the interface of protein complexes display an enrichment of motions, suggesting an important role for dynamics in molecular recognition.23 Heme uptake by HasA X-ray and NMR structures of HasA show one conformer in the closed holo form and one conformer in the open apo form. Actually, there is no evidence that motions of loop L1 allow the protein to occasionally access the closed state or a nearly closed state in the apo form. Obviously, binding of the ligand induces conformational changes at the binding site, driving it towards the closed form. The "induced fit" model has been introduced to account for this type of plasticity to accommodate a ligand and could apply here to the mecha-

523 coordination would induce a decrease in the affinity of HasA for heme and allow the heme transfer to the receptor. This does not exclude the fact that the affinity of the receptor for heme may be increased in the HasA­HasR complex, therefore helping the transfer mechanism.

nism of heme uptake by HasA:25 HasA + heme  heme­Y75 H32 -  (HasA - heme)closed heme - Y75. (HasA - heme)open We propose a two-step mechanism: first, the binding pocket is opened and heme interacts with loop L2 and its flanking regions. Three arguments stand for this: (i) In apoHasA, this part of the pocket is rigid and has the same structure as in the holo form. (ii) In holoHasA, the loop L2 part of the pocket has large hydrophobic and stacking contacts with heme, in contrast to loop L1. (iii) Loop L2 contains Y75, the strongest axial ligand. The tight hydrogen bond between Y75 and H83, increasing the tyrosinate character and the Y75­ iron bond strength, is maintained in the apo form. Second, the pocket closes with a large shift of loop L1. Heme binding proceeds, mainly via H32­iron coordination and formation of three hydrogen bonds involving the propionate groups, leading to a stable closed state and to a high-affinity complex. The dynamics of loop L1 is likely to be essential for the formation of the stable closed form of HasA. The high mobility of several residues of loop L1 in apoHasA and a local conformational heterogeneity of the hinge regions modulate the strength of the interactions between the loop and the core of the hemophore and may contribute to their loss in the heme­Y75 state. We suggest that heme (HasA - heme)open binding to the loop L2 side of the pocket induces dynamic changes allowing the rupture of these interactions, large amplitude motions of loop L1 and the access to a closed state. Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations will be useful to characterize the open-to-closed transition of loop L1 in terms of kinetics, hinge mechanism and energies. Heme release to the receptor HasA has a higher affinity for heme (Ka = 5.3 × 1010 M- 1) than its receptor HasR (Ka = 5 × 106 M- 1 ), which raises the question of the heme transfer from a high-affinity protein to a lower affinity protein.4,26 The heme transfer from the hemophore to its receptor implies a change in the affinity of at least one of the partners. In holoHasA, the Y75­iron coordination is stronger than the H32­iron coordination and is very delicately balanced. Indeed, we recently showed by NMR that iron(III) presents a thermal high spin­low spin equilibrium depending on the stability of the Y75­iron bond, which in turn is governed by the Y75­H83 hydrogen bond strength.7 We propose that the flexibility of loop L2 and of its flanking regions observed here for the loaded form of HasA is involved in the modulation of the Y75­iron bond strength and in heme transfer. Upon binding of HasA to HasR, dynamics and conformational changes are thought to occur at least in the two regions of the -sheet of HasA involved in the interaction. The S51­T60 region is very close to loop L2 (d S51C­Y75C = 6 Å). Consequently, the HasA­HasR interaction more likely induces an alteration of the dynamics and/or conformational properties of loop L2, triggering the elongation and the breaking of the H83­Y75 hydrogen bond. The consecutive weakening and loss of the iron­Y75

Sample preparation Samples of uniformly 15N and 15N­13C labelled apoHasA were produced in M9 minimal medium containing 15 NH4Cl and [12C/13C]glycerol as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively.27 Proteins were purified as previously described28 after cleavage of the last nine C-terminal residues.29 GaPPIX­HasA was prepared by adding saturating amounts of a freshly prepared GaPPIX solution to apoHasA. The excess of GaPPIX was eliminated by gel filtration.10 The concentrations of protein samples were 1.2 to 1.8 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, H2O/D2O (90:10 v/v) for the structure determination, and 0.1 and 1 mM for apoHasA and GaPPIX­HasA, respectively, for the dynamics experiments. ApoHasA structure NMR spectroscopy NMR spectra were recorded at 30 °C on Varian Inova 500- and 750-MHz spectrometers. Data were processed using NMRpipe software and analyzed with the XEASY program.30,31 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) as 0 ppm.32 15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to DSS. The pulse sequences of experiments were taken as implemented in the Varian Biopack. The 1H, 15N and 13C sequence specific resonances were deposited at the BioMagRes Bank (accession number 4309). The assignment was checked and completed with a set of standard 3-D heteronuclear experiments. Side chains were assigned from HCCH correlated spectroscopy (COSY), HCCH total COSY (TOCSY) and HCC(CO)NH TOCSY experiments, with occasional assistance from 3-D 13C and 15N NOESY data. (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE and 1H­13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments were used to assign the aromatic side chains. All distance restraints used for the structure calculation of apoHasA were derived from 3-D 13C and 15N edited 1 H­1H NOESY experiments with mixing time of 100 ms. Dihedral angle restraints were deduced from 3J(HN,HA) coupling constants extracted from HN­HA experiments.33,34 Hydrogen bond donors were identified from a series of fast 1H­15N HSQC spectra of freshly lyophilized samples dissolved in 99.9% D2O collected over 6 weeks.

The temperature and the number of dynamics steps in the high-temperature search phase of the protocol were increased to 20,000 and 40,000, respectively. The 100 energetically best structures calculated in the last iteration were refined in explicit water, the final structure ensemble comprised the 10 lowest-energy structures. Structural quality was assessed using the programs PROCHECK39 and WHATIF.40 Dynamic light scattering Photon correlation experiments were performed at 30 °C with a DynaPro MS800 instrument (Wyatt) equipped with a 824.7-nm laser, using 3-mm path-length quartz cuvettes (Hellma). For each sample (0.1 and 1 mM for apoHasA; 1 mM for GaPPIX­HasA; 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6), the total light scattered at an angle of 90° was collected using a 10-s averaging acquisition time. Particle translational diffusion coefficients (DT) were calculated from the autocorrelated light intensity data and converted to hydrodynamic radii (Rh) with the Stokes­Einstein equation. Distribution plots of intensity versus Rh were analyzed with the SEDFIT software. Protein dynamics NMR spectroscopy One set of T1 and T2 spectra and three sets of 15N heteronuclear NOE spectra were recorded for both apoHasA and GaPPIX­HasA at 30 °C on a Varian Inova 500 MHz. For T1 experiments, relaxation delays were 0.022, 0.056, 0.155, 0.255, 0.500, 0.755, 1.010 and 1.998 s, and for T2 experiments, 0.016, 0.032, 0.047, 0.063, 0.095, 0.126 and 0.158 s. Proton saturation in NOE experiments was achieved by application of 1H 120° pulses every 5 ms during 3 s. The overall delay between each scan was 5 s in both NOE experiments with and without proton saturation. Analysis of relaxation data R1 and R2 relaxation rates were determined by fitting the T1 and T2 peak intensities to a single-exponential decay using the program Curvefit (Palmer, 1991). The 1H­15N NOE values are the ratios between the intensities of corresponding peaks in the spectra recorded with and without presaturation of the amide protons. R1, R2 and NOE were analyzed in terms of internal motions, using the simple or extended model-free Lipari­ Szabo approach.11­13 To determine the most appropriate procedure for modeling the relaxation parameters of each residue, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed using 500 generated "experimental" values. Descriptions of the main principles for model selection, optimization and error analysis using Monte Carlo simulations have been published previously.41,42 The overall correlation time r was optimized using the approach of Mispelter et al.16 The diffusion tensors of HasA were determined as proposed by Brüschweiler et al.15 and by Lee et al.14 Data bank accession codes Chemical shifts of apoHasA have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession number 12257).
