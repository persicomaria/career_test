The ribonucleic acid of turnip yellow mosaic virus was digested with pancreatic ribonuclease and the resulting oligonucleotides were separated according to their length on DEAE-cellulose columns in the presence of urea. The individual fractions were further fractionated on Dowex-1 columns according to their base composition, up to the pentanucleotide level. The fractions were then characterized with respect to both their base compositions and the portion of the total represented by them. The usefulness of the method for the characterization of RNA's from different virus strains is pointed out.
INTRODUCTION

The unique role presently attributed to viral ribonucleic acids (RNA) in genetic coding makes the knowledge of their primary structure (nucleotide sequence) of paramount importance. However, because of their size it is not possible to determine their total structure with the techniques now available. Nevertheless the analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of alanyl t-RNA, a polymer consisting of 77 nucleo-

tide residues, has been achieved (Halley et al., 1965). There are several techniques now available for the determination of partial sequences of nucleic acids (Volkin and Cohn, 1953; Reddi, 1959; Rushizky and Knight, 1960a, b, c; Rushizky and Sober, 1962; Rushizky et al., 1961, 1962a, b, 1964; Staehelin, 1961a, b,c; Symons et al., 1963; Tomlinson and Tener, 1963a,b; Bartos et al., 1963). The results obtained by the

application of such methods are the subject of the present paper. Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) was chosen for these studies because of (1) the relative ease of its purification, (2) high virus yields, and (3) high RNA content (39 %, Haselkorn, 1962). Recentlv Symons et al. (1963), in an attempt to distinguish various strains of this virus, studied the oligonucleotide composition of its RNA after pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) digestion. Using the procedure of Staehelin (1961a, b,c) they were able to separate oligonucleotides up to the trinucleotide level, but the larger oligonucleotides overlapped and could not be analyzed. In the
present paper it will be shown how oligo-

nucleotides up to the pentanucleotide can be separated and analyzed.

acetate solution. The columns were then equilibrated with a 7 M urea/O.005 M Trishydrochloride buffer, pH 7.8. The RNase digest was diluted 1:5 with 7 M urea/O.005 M Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.8, and applied to the column. The column was then subjected to a linear gradient of NaCl, 0.0 to 0.3 M, both solutions being 7 M in urea and 0.005 M in Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.8. Further details with the individual preparations are given with the tables. The fractions were collected at constant time intervals with an automatic fraction collector. The absorbance of the contents of the tubes were read at 271 rnp in a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer, and the fractions in the same peak were pooled. Desalting of the fractions was done by diluting them 1: 5 with distilled Hz0 and passing the solutions through a DEAEcellulose (carbonate form) column (3.5 X 18 cm). The urea was washed off with distilled water and the chloride ions with 0.02 M triethylammonium bicarbonate. The nucleotides were finally eluted with 1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate, and evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature below 30". The residue was taken up in 5-8 ml of distilled water for fractionation according t,o base composition. Fractima.tion of the oligonucleotides according to their base composition was carried , out essentially by the method developed by Volkin and Cohn (1953). The individual fractions were eluted by passing a linear gradient of 0.004.01 N HCl and an appropriate NaCl gradient (see figures). The total O.D. units4 at 271 rnp was determined in pooled fractions of the individual peaks. The fractions were then neutralized with 50% KOH, diluted 1~5, and desalted as mentioned above. After evaporation the residues were taken up in a minimum amount of distilled water, transferred into test tubes, and evaporated again to dryness prior to the determination of the base ratios or nucleotide sequences.

After 3 weeks at 68°F the plants showed severe symptoms of systemic infection and were then harvested. The virus was purified a,s described by Markham and Smith (1949) and examined in the Spinco model E analytical ultracentrifuge. Most prepara,tions contained small amounts of RNA-free virus particles in addition to the normal TYMV particles, but no other components were detectable in the preparations. Nucleic acid preparations and digestion. High molecular weight RNA was prepared according to Gierer and Schramm (1956). After the ether extraction the RNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of isopropanol and 2--3 drops of 3 M sodium acetate. The pellet, obtained after centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes was taken up in a measured volume of 0.1 M Tris-hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.8 and an aliquot was taken out, for optical density measurements. These were determined with a Beckman model DU spectrophotometer at 260 ME.1 and at, 230 mp. The RNA was immediately digested in 0.1 M Tris-hydrochloride buffer, pH 7.8, with j.is its weight of pancreatic ribonuclease (Nutritional Biochemicals) at 37" for 22 hours.

Detelmin&ion of the base ratios. The dry sample was taken up in 0.05 ml of N HCI. The test tube was sealed so as to leave about 2 ml of internal volume and immersed in a boiling water bath for 1 hour. The hydrolyzate was directly spotted on What,man No. 40 chromatographic paper in quantities of about lo-15 O.D. units (271 rnp) per spot. The components were separated by descending chromatography in the isopropanolHCI-water system, and the base ratios were determined according to Smith and Markham (1950). When hydrolyzates of oligonucleotides previously treated with PME were analyzed, the moles of cytidine and uridine were calculated from O.D. measurements at 280 rnp and 260 rnp, respectively, and using the molar extinction coefficients of 13.4 X lo3 and 9.95 X 103, respectively (cf. Dawson et al., 1959). Alkaline hydrolysis was done in 0.3 N NaOH at 37" for 18 hours. The hydrolyzate was neutralized with Dowex 5OW-4X 50100 mesh resin (hydrogen form), evaporated to a small volume, and subjected to high voltage electrophoresis. High voltage electrophoresis. A watercooled flat plate apparatus was used for the high voltage paper electrophoresis. The nucleotides were separated in 0.02 M formate buffer pH 3.5 at 30 volts/cm. The electrophoresis was continued for that period of time required by a picric acid marker to travel the entire distance of 75 cm along the sbrip (approximat'ely 2 hours).

The individual nucleotides were characterized by comparison with a strip cont,aining an equimolar mixture of the four standard nucleoside-2'(3') phosphates. Digestion with alkaline phosphatase @`ME'). Chromatographically purified PIVE from Escherichia coli (Worthington Biochemical Corporat,ion, Freehold, New Jersey) was used. The nucleotide sample to be treated was evaporated to dryness and taken up in 1 ml of 0.01 M ammonium carbonate, pH S.O/O.OOl M MgC12. The enzyme was taken up in distilled water (10 mg/ml), and 0.1 mg per 50 O.D. units (271 rnp) of nucleotide was added for digestion at 37" for 18 hours. A drop of chloroform was used as a preservative. Stepwise degradation of oligonucleotides by periodate oxidation was carried out according to the method of Neu and Heppel (1964). The GpApUp and ApGpUp oligonucleotides (0.16 pmole in 0.1 m1 water) were treated with PME as above, followed by the addition of 0.05 ml of 0.1 M NaI04 to each. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 45" for 30 minutes in the dark after which they were mixed with 0.1 ml of 1 M lysine, pH 8.0, and incubated for a further 90 minutes at 45" in the dark. The reaction mixtures were then evaporated to a very small volume and spotted quantitatively on Whatman No. 40 paper and run indescending chromatography overnight in a butanolsystem. acetic arid-Hz0 (4: 1: 1, V/V/V) The UV absorbing spot's with the highest

Calculations. The determinations of percentages of the fractions were based on the total O.D. recovered from the column in 7 M urea rather than on their absorption measured in water. The measurements were made at 271 rnp at pH 7.8 using an average molar extinction coefficient of 9.04 X lo3 based on the nucleotide composition of TYMV-RNA. At this wavelength the individual nucleotides show molar extinction coefficients within 10% of each other and the use ok this extinction coefficient for evaluation of molar ratios in individual peaks whose base composition was not known should not result in serious errors. On the acid column (pH 3), t'he base composition of the individual peaks was known and the appropriate average extinction coefficients at 271 rnp were calculated Corrections were made for accordingly. losses in process of desalting and evaporation.

The separation of oligonucleotides on DEAE-cellulose columns in urea has been carried out on three RNase-digested TYMVRNA preparations. A representative elution pattern is shown in Fig. 1, and the percentages of the fractions obtained are reported in Table 1. The arabic numbers at the peaks in Fig. 1 show the number of nucleotides per oligonucleotide molecule in the corresponding fraction (Tomlinson and Tener, 1963a). The letters designate minor fractions the composition of some of which has been investigated. Upon alkaline hydrolysis peak b proved to contain only Ap, whereas peak c consisted of both Ap and Gp, as evidenced by high voltage electrophoresis. From their behavior on the urea column at pH 7.8, they are tentatively characterized as ApAp! and GpAp!, respectively. Beers

by such nonspecific action of RNase. On the other hand, the possibility cannot be ruled out, that the TYMV-RNA was fragmented to some extent in the preparation employed. Hence, ApAp ! could have come from typical activity of RNase on a sequence such as -CpApAp! From Table 1 it may be seen that the percentage occurrence of the fractions differs to a considerable extent from what is expected on the basis of a random distribution. The mono- and dinucleotides have not been further separated in view of the fact that Symons et al. (1963) had done so. The combined mononucleotide content and dinucleotide content in Table 1 are in good agreement with their data. The elution pattern of the trinucleotides gives quite a clear picture (Fig. 2). The fractions in the first 15-20 tubes did not show a spectrum characteristic for nucleotides. The peak may be due to some nonvolatile residue originating from the triethylammonium bicarbonate. The composition and percentages of the peaks are shown in Table 2 for two independent preparations. The data from the two samples are in very good agreement except for the GpGpCp. This discrepancy may be due to the tendency

The tetra- and pentanucleotides were treated with PME prior to the separation on the basis of composition. The reduction of the number of negative charges so accomplished should improve the separation (Staehelin, 1963). The separation of the tetranucleotides is

`graphically represented in Fig. 3 and the base ratios and percentages are given in Table 3. It should be noted that unlike the case of the trinucleotides the isomeric tetranucleotides were no longer resolved. However, the tetranucleotides of different base composition were separated and reproducibly determined.

peaks (a, b, c, d in Fig. 3). The sum total of the O.D. units found in the two analyzed digests were the same within the experimental error. The difficulty in separating the Gp-rich aggregated oligonucleotides is aggravated in this experiment by the incomplete removal of terminal phosphates by PME from these oligonucleotides (Lipsett and Heppel, 1963). The analysis of the minor peaks (Table 3), although not very accurate because of the very small amounts of material, indicates the high Gp content in these fractions.

In order to avoid the probable aggregation of oligomers rich in Gp as experienced with the tetranucleotides, the fractionation of pentanucleotides was carried out in the presence of 7 A4 urea (Tomlinson and Tener, 1963a). The results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 4. The peaks in fractions 1 to 25 did not have characteristic spectra of RNA digestion products. The spectra of fractions 25-200 could not be taken because of the very small optical density. The major peaks, however, could be well characterized. In spite of the use of 7 1M urea in the elution,

GpGpGpGpU and GpGpGpGpC oligonucleotides were not detected in discrete peaks. Disregarding isomers the number of peaks expected for the rest of the pentanucleotides was 8. However, only 6 major peaks were obtained. A detailed analysis of the ind-ividual peaks showed that the fractions 3 and 4 contained both pyrimidines, indicating the presence of two molecular species. Assuming the order of elution to be in t'he sequence of increasing negative charges, peak S should have contained ApApApApU followed by ApApGpGpC. From the quantitative determination of the bases in peak S it was obvious that the two were eluted together. A oligonucleotides similar analysis showed peak 4 to be a mixture of the two pentanucleotides given in Table 4.
DISCUSSION

The present study was aimed at a more detailed elucidation of partial nucleotide sequences in viral RNA by combining twocolumn chromatographic methods for separating the oligonucleotides resulting from pancreatic RNase digestion. In the first column, elution by neutral salt solutions containing 7 M urea to suppress secondary binding forces between the oligonucleotides and the DEAE-cellulose led to the separation of the mixture into fractions containing oligomers of equal length. These individual fract,ions were then subfractionated under acidic conditions on Dowex 1 resins: a separation which depends not only on the charge carried by each oligomer but also on hydrophobic interaction between the resin and the base residues (Volkin and Cohn, 1953). An extensive fractionation of the digest thus resulted. It should be noted that in the isolation described by Symons et al. (1963) a third separation step was required to fractionate the t'rinucleotides. Even so, these authors do not report on the content of GpGpCp and GpGpUp or of any of the higher oligonucleotides in TYMV. On the other hand, the procedure described in this paper enabled us to separate and evaluate most of the oligonucleotides up to the pentanucleotide level. However, no separation of the isomeric tetra- and pentanucleotides was

accomplished and also one pair of trinucleotides was unresolved. Difficulties were also encountered with the tetra- and pentanucleotides containing only guanosine residues (in addition to the terminal pyrimidine nucleotides) because of their tendency to aggregate. The method used seems to offer some advantage over that reported recently by Rushizky et al. (1964) in that even with the pentanucleotides, the fractions can be identified according to their base ratios, whereas in their procedure Ap + Cp are treated as a single nucleotide fraction. Potentially the method can be extended further for establishing the molar ratios of some of the isomers. For example the oligomer (ApApGp) C consisting of the isomers ApApGpC, ApGpApC, GpApApC could be treated with ribonuclease Tl (Sato and Egami, 1957) which cleaves the guanosine3' phosphate ester bonds giving rise in this case to the following products: ApApGp + C; ApGp + ApC; Gp + ApApC; these could be separated and the amounts of the products could be used for determining the molar percentages of the isomers in question. The method may also be useful in the characterization of virus strains and viruses which are claimed to be related on the basis of serological behavior (Bercks, 1960).
