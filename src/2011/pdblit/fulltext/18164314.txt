Potentially mutagenic uracil-containing nucleotide intermediates are generated by deamination of dCTP, either spontaneously or enzymatically as the first step in the conversion of dCTP to dTTP. dUTPases convert dUTP to dUMP, thus avoiding the misincorporation of dUTP into DNA and creating the substrate for the next enzyme in the dTTP synthetic pathway, thymidylate synthase. Although dCTP deaminase and dUTPase activities are usually found in separate but homologous enzymes, the hyperthermophile Methanococcus jannaschii has an enzyme, DCD-DUT, that harbors both dCTP deaminase and dUTP pyrophosphatase activities. DCD-DUT has highest activity on dCTP, followed by dUTP, and dTTP inhibits both the deaminase and pyrophosphatase activities. To help clarify structure­function relationships for DCD-DUT, we have determined the crystal structure of the wild-type DCD-DUT protein in its apo ° form to 1.42 A and structures of DCD-DUT in complex with dCTP and ° ° dUTP to resolutions of 1.77 A and 2.10 A, respectively. To gain insights into substrate interactions, we complemented analyses of the experimentally defined weak density for nucleotides with automated docking experiments using dCTP, dUTP, and dTTP. DCD-DUT is a hexamer, unlike the homologous dUTPases, and its subunits contain several insertions and substitutions different from the dUTPase b barrel core that likely contribute to dCTP specificity and deamination. These first structures of a dCTP deaminase reveal a probable role for an unstructured C-terminal region different from that of the dUTPases and possible mechanisms for both bifunctional enzyme activity and feedback inhibition by dTTP.

Introduction
Deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides is essential for conversion to thymidine nucleotides. However, uracil-containing intermediates can be mutagenic or cytotoxic. Deoxynucleotidohydrolases uridine 50 -triphosphate (dUTPases) play an essential role in the nucleotide

metabolism of all organisms by catalyzing the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP þ pyrophosphate (Ppi).1,2 This provides dUMP, a precursor for dTTP synthesis by thymidylate synthase, and protects DNA from misincorporation of dUTP in place of dTTP by lowering dUTP:dTTP ratios. Uridine nucleotides can also arise in DNA through the spontaneous deamination of cytidine, which accounts for a significant percentage of DNA base damage.3 If left unrepaired, uracil can create CG to TA transition mutations.4 When uracil is found in DNA, either from misincorporation instead of thymine or spontaneous deamination of cytosine, the base excision repair pathway is initiated by uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), which recognizes a U:A mispair but which can result in apyrimidinic sites or DNA strand cleavage if the damage is not properly processed.4 To adjust levels of dCTP in

Structure of a dCTP Deaminase/dUTPase

relation to dTTP in the nucleotide pool, dCTP can be converted to dUTP in archaea and some bacteria by dCTP deaminase, then acted upon by dUTPase to form dUMP.5 dUMP is subsequently converted to dTTP by thymidylate synthase and thymidylate kinase. Eukaryotes and some bacteria create dUMP directly from dCMP via a zinc-dependent dCMP deaminase.6,7 As temperatures increase, rates of spontaneous deamination also increase such that hyperthermophilic organisms must have efficient mechanisms for dealing with this potential hazard.8,9 The hyperthermophile Methanococcus jannaschii has both a dCTP deaminase (encoded by the gene at locus MJ0430) and a dUTP pyrophosphatase (MJ1102), but interestingly the dCTP deaminase also harbors dUTPase activity.10,11 We therefore, refer to the product of the MJ0430 gene as DCDDUT, for dCTP deaminase/dUTPase. Kinetic data have revealed that the dual activities of the DCDDUT enzyme occur independently at the same active site and that both activities require Mg2þ, indicating that DCD-DUT is able to convert dCTP to dUMP directly, without releasing dUTP as an intermediate. This results in a highly efficient means for producing thymidylate precursors without releasing the potentially harmful dUTP intermediate. As a mechanism of feedback inhibition, dTTP is inhibitory to DCD-DUT.10 dUTPases have attracted much attention due to their ubiquitous occurrence and essential nature, being found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, archaea, and several viruses.12 ­ 14 In mammalian cells, nuclear and mitochondrial isoforms of dUTPase are expressed from a single gene, with highest levels occurring in undifferentiated proliferating cells, making them an attractive target for drug design.15 Indeed, several chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate, are thought to act by allowing misincorporation of dUTP into DNA. Some retroviruses, such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), encode their own dUTPases to protect their cDNA from uracil misincorporation during its synthesis in the cytosol.16,17 Thus, dUTPases may be important targets for rational drug design experiments with a wide range of applications. Primary sequence analyses and phylogenetic tree constructions have revealed that dCTP deaminases and dUTPases together constitute an enzyme superfamily.12,13,18 No homology has been detected between the dCTP deaminases and the cytidine or cytosine deaminases of non-archaeal organisms. Furthermore, Escherichia coli have separate dCTP, cytosine, and cytidine deaminases, as well as a dUTPase.5,19,20 Thus, several key questions remain regarding the relationship of bacterial and archaeal dCTP deaminases with the ubiquitous dUTPases, particularly in the case of the archaeal DCD-DUT enzyme, which contains both activities. Crystal structures have been reported for human, E. coli, FIV, and equine infectious anaemia

virus (EIAV) dUTPases, revealing a trimeric assembly with contributions from each subunit to each of three identical active sites.2,14,21 ­ 24 No crystal structures have yet been described for any of the dCTP deaminases, but it has been speculated that they might have a similar overall tertiary and quaternary structure to that of the dUTPases. In all but one of the dUTPase structures, main-chain residues and a structural water molecule are employed to mimic base-pair hydrogen bonding in selecting for dUTP rather than dCTP.2,14,23,24 How these backbone interactions might be altered to accommodate dCTP binding has been unclear, as are the mechanism of dCTP deamination and the residues involved. dTTP has been shown to inhibit the deaminase and pyrophosphatase activities of DCD-DUT, but it is unclear whether the base can be accommodated in the active site, if poor positioning leads to competitive inhibition, or if inhibition proceeds via an alternate route.10 To address these questions, we have determined the first structure of a dCTP deaminase, M. jannaschii DCD-DUT, and we show that, while the sequence is most similar to the dCTP deaminases, the overall fold and subunit assembly are similar to those of the dUTPases. Interestingly, several critical insertions and amino acid replacements confer specificity for dCTP and catalysis of its deamination and provide a platform for dimerization of trimers to form functional hexamers. We have also modeled nucleotides into weak density from cocrystals and compared the resulting structures to docked enzyme-nucleotide complexes to gain insight into how each nucleotide is specifically recognized and bound. These structures allow the first three-dimensional comparison of dUTPase and dCTP deaminase active sites and suggest a mechanism for dCTP deamination catalysis as well as for dTTP inhibition of DCD-DUT activity.

Results and Discussion
DCD-DUT comprises the dUTPase jelly roll fold plus two helices and a b-arm To better understand the bifunctional activity of DCD-DUT (Figure 1), the structure of DCD-DUT was determined using tungsten MAD data to ° 1.8 A resolution, and the native structure has been ° refined against data to 1.42 A resolution (Table 1). The dCTP deaminase subunit forms a b barrel with a jelly roll fold and a flexible C-terminal extension that likely becomes ordered only upon binding substrate, similar to the dUTPases (Figure 2).2,24,25 The jelly roll consists of two b sheets made up of three and four antiparallel b strands and is distorted somewhat by insertions at connections between b1 and b3, and b3 and b8. While the overall topology of the core b barrel domain of DCD-DUT is similar to that of the dUTPases, three insertions into DCD-DUT, two additional subdomains and an a helix, are not

seen in any dUTPase structures (Figure 3). The first additional subdomain is a b arm (residues 38 ­61) that extends away from the subunit core, wrapping around an adjacent subunit in the context of a trimer. Sequence alignments suggest that the b arm may be conserved among dCTP deaminases (Figure 2). The other unique subdomain is a small a/b motif (residues 62 ­ 95 and 150 ­156) that has little homology to the other dCTP deaminases. The a/b subdomain lies at the bottom of the jelly roll, adding antiparallel b strands to that domain. The inserted a helix is found near the N terminus (residues 5­ 13), lying flat across the top of the subunit. Although the extreme C-terminal residues (residues 184 ­204 and 176 ­204 from the two different subunits) are not observed in our DCD-

DUT structures, the C-terminal arm of one subunit has seven more ordered residues than the other subunit, which extend in the opposite direction of the dUTPase arms. However, the C terminus is intact in our protein preparations, as confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Although several key active-site residues differ, likely owing to their very different activities, four of the five sequence motifs that define the dUTPases and contribute to their nucleotide binding site are also conserved among dCTP deaminases (Figure 2), and DCD-DUT shares more homology with the dCTP deaminases than the dUTPases. While dUTPase motifs I, II, and IV, responsible for binding phosphate, are largely conserved across the superfamily, motif III, which specifically recognizes the pyrimidine moiety, has several differences unique to the two respective families that could account for altered base specificity. Motif V, also involved in base recognition and catalysis, is missing or very different in the dCTP deaminases, although the presence of a motif fulfilling a similar role in activity is not precluded, particularly since significant sequence homology is shared between the dCTP deaminases in this region. Trimer and hexamer assembly The DCD-DUT trimer interface resembles that of the dUTPases, in which three identical subunits also make up a tightly interlocked trimer. Residues from each subunit come together to form the active site, which is copied thrice in the trimer. The b arm from one subunit extends toward an adjacent

subunit (Figure 4), such that its negatively charged tip interacts with positively charged residues from the small a/b subdomain. Specifically, Glu49 interacts with Lys85 and Asp44 interacts with Lys151 of the adjacent subunit (not shown). Hydrogen bonds

between Asp149 and Tyr156 as well as Tyr48 and Asp150 also aid in positioning the tip of the b arm adjacent to the a/b subdomain. These interactions ° take place approximately 20 A away from the active site and likely contribute to the stability of the trimeric assembly. The trimer interface is largely hydrophobic, and in particular the central 3-fold axis is lined by hydrophobic and polar residues (M1, I2, S167, W133, I165, Q113, A131, Q115, H128 (backbone contacts), Q129, T126, F149, L70, P69, and N71). In contrast, the human dUTPase has alternating bands of positively and negatively charged residues lining its solvent-exposed 3-fold axis.2 The DCD-DUT trimer interface is thus more similar to the bacterial and retroviral dUTPases, which have hydrophobic, solvent-excluded interfaces.14,21,22 The hydrophobic nature of the DCD-DUT trimerization interface likely contributes to the stability of the enzyme at the high temperatures (85 8C) and high intracellular salt concentrations at which the enzyme must act. Gel-filtration experiments with DCD-DUT have indicated that the stable complex in solution has a mass of , 136 kDa, suggesting that the 23.4 kDa DCD-DUT protein forms hexamers.10 The crystals of DCD-DUT contain two subunits in the asymmetric unit, each of which is related by symmetry to a distinct trimeric assembly about a 3-fold axis. As shown in Figure 4, the two trimers assemble into a hexamer by stacking on top of each other, such that all six N termini come together (Figure 4). Addition of an N-terminal six-histidine

tag results in an enzyme of , 77.9 kDa in gelfiltration experiments, close to the predicted 72.8 kDa mass of a DCD-DUT trimer. The C terminus: an essential unstructured region The C-terminal residues of DCD-DUT display varying amounts of disorder in our crystal structures, yet these residues have been shown to be critical for both deamination and pyrophosphatase activities. Although the C termini of the dCTP deaminase and dUTPase families have divergent sequences, the importance of this disordered region is underscored by the ordering of both C termini only upon substrate binding. The C-terminal residues of dUTPases and DCD-DUT have been shown to be essential for full enzymatic activity.11,25 Spectroscopic studies with the E. coli dUTPase revealed that the C terminus of that enzyme becomes ordered only in the presence of both substrate and catalytic metal ion.25 Of 13 separate structure determinations of dUTPases from four organisms, the C-terminal motif V was ordered in only four cases: the FIV dUTPase:dUDP and human dUTPase:dUMP, dUDP, and dUTP complex structures.2,14,21 ­ 24,26,27 Thus it is not surprising that this motif, which retains no homology but likely plays a similar role in catalysis of phosphoester hydrolysis, is disordered in our enzyme: nucleotide complex structures, particularly since nucleotide triphosphate density is weak in these structures. That the C termini of both dUTPases and dCTP deaminases appear to be disordered in the absence of substrate and metal affirms a key role for this motif, as coupling of folding and binding in unstructured regions has been shown to confer functional advantages, such as more precise control over thermodynamics of binding and decreased sensitivity to environmental changes.28,29 The importance of these unstructured regions has largely been implicated in signal transduction in mutlicellular eukaryotic organisms, although many specific examples can be found in prokaryotic systems as well, such as the coil-to-helix transition undergone within the E. coli LacI DNA binding domain upon binding cognate DNA.30 The base specificity pocket The substrate binding pocket is forged in a manner resembling the dUTPases, in which motifs I, II, and IV come from one subunit to recognize the phosphate moieties of the substrate, and motif III, from a second subunit, specifically recognizes the base and deoxyribose moieties (Figure 5). The dCTP deaminase counterpart to motif V, which shares no sequence homology with the dUTPase motif, is disordered in our structures. Our crystals contain two distinct subunits in the asymmetric unit, and the active sites of the two trimers generated by symmetry differ somewhat in composition. A helix from the a/b subdomain of one trimer sub-

unit (residues 73 ­ 85) covers an active site of the other trimer. No such interaction is seen in the active site of the trimer that donates the helix. The significance of this interaction is unclear, but it may be an artifact of crystal packing, as nucleotides could not be located in this pocket in cocrystal structures. However, the covering helix makes numerous close contacts with residues from motif II and the b arm of the subunit whose active site it covers. In all but one of the dUTPase structures, mainchain atoms from motif III and a structural water molecule are employed to mimic base-pair hydrogen bonding in selecting for dUTP rather than dCTP. Comparison of dCTP deaminase and dUTPase active sites reveals several striking differences. DCD-DUT cannot accommodate the base in the same orientation along the motif III backbone (Figure 6(A)). Side-chains of His128 and Glu145 at the top of the active site, together with Phe138 at the bottom, enforce an altered position in which dCTP is tilted in the DCD-DUT active site relative to the position of uracil in the dUTPases (Figure 6). These residues are conserved among dCTP deaminases but are not found in any of the strict dUTPases. This orientation was observed in our DCD-DUT:dCTP crystal structure, although electron density for dCTP was weak, even at ° 1.77 A resolution. We therefore confirmed this

position by close agreement between our model built into electron density and automated docking of dCTP to the protein with AutoDock.31 Hydrogen bonds to the motif III backbone are only minimally retained, and the orientation is distorted from the flat, base-pair-mimicking geometry of the dUTPases. The dCTP N4 atom makes contacts ° with His128 N12 (2.9 A), Thr143 backbone O ° ° ), and Glu145 O11 and O12 (3.0 A each) (2.7 A atoms. dCTP N3 and O2 each contact a water ° ° molecule (3.0 A and 3.2 A, respectively). This water molecule is also coordinated by His128 N12 ° ° (2.9 A) and the Gly132 backbone O (3.1 A), ensuring that the bound pyrimidine ring has one hydrogen bond acceptor and one donor. dUTP occupies a similar position in DCD-DUT, although the uridine lies farther from the motif III backbone, likely due to its different hydrogen bonding pattern (Figure 6(B)). The dUTP O4 inter° ° acts with His128 N11 (2.9 A), Thr143 O (2.6 A), and 11 ° ). N3 interacts weakly with the E145 O (2.7 A ° Thr143 backbone O (3.3 A). This is very unlike the binding of dUTP in the human dUTPase structure,2 where O4 makes hydrogen bonds with a structural ° water (2.8 A) and the backbone N of a glycine ° equivalent to Thr143 (2.9 A), N3 hydrogen bonds ° with the backbone O of this glycine (2.9 A), and O2 also hydrogen bonds with the glycine N ° (3.1 A). The close contact between dUTP O4 and DCD-DUT O atoms is likely to be unfavorable and contribute to the much lower affinity of DCDDUT for dUTP relative to the affinity of the strict dUTPases (dUTP pyrophosphatase Km ¼ 0:2 mM for E. coli dUTPase, 263 mM for DCD-DUT).10,32 It thus appears that DCD-DUT has evolved an active-site pocket with optimal affinity for dCTP but retains some features of dUTPases to bind dUTP. Recognition of the sugar-phosphate moiety The dCTP deoxyribose ring is specifically recognized by a combination of hydrophobic (Ile134, Phe138, and Ile142) residues, together with a specific hydrogen bond between O30 and Asp135 (Figure 6(C)). Ile134 prohibits ribose binding,

making a close contact between its Cg and the ° deoxyribose C2 atoms (3.1 A). The ribose exocyclic O30 hydroxyl makes hydrogen bonds with an Od of the Asp135 carboxylate side-chain and the Asp135 backbone N atom. The triphosphate moiety orientation is similar to that seen in the dUTPases, where the b and g phosphate groups appear to be mobile. Several distinct lobes of electron density are attached to that of the ° ° a phosphate, even in 1.77 A and 2.10 A resolution structures with dCTP and dUTP, respectively (not shown). AutoDock simulations also placed the dCTP and dUTP g phosphate in an array of positions, the predominant one being eclipsed, similar to that seen in the human and FIV dUTPase:dUTP structures. However, the position of the a phosphate is conserved, and it makes a hydrogen bond with Ser118, a contact that appears to be conserved across the dUTPase superfamily (Figure 6(C)). Additionally, Arg122, conserved among dCTP deaminases, makes a hydrogen bond with the a phosphate, whereas the b phosphate makes hydrogen bonds with Arg117 and Ser119. Although the g phosphate is mobile, it appears to contact Ser118 in its predominant position. The catalysis of both dCTP deamination and phosphoester hydrolysis has been shown to be metal-dependent, with highest activity resulting from Mg2þ addition.10 Mutation of Asp135, located in the DCD-DUT active site and implicated in metal and deoxyribose moiety binding, to asparagine results in an enzyme with no activity that also forms only trimers in gel-filtration experiments.10 In the structure of EIAV dUTPase, determined in the presence of Sr2þ and dUDP, the metal ion is coordinated by the diphosphate moiety of dUDP and six water molecules.14 The aspartate residue of EIAV dUTPase corresponding to Asp135 in DCD-DUT makes water-mediated interactions with the metal ion in addition to a hydrogen bond with the deoxyribose exocyclic O30 . Similar interactions between Mg2þ and the dCTP/dUTP phosphate moieties are predicted for DCD-DUT, although Mg2þ addition did not improve the nucleotide electron density or result in location of Mg2þ in the active site.

Structure of a dCTP Deaminase/dUTPase

Catalytic mechanism of deamination In place of the structural water molecule observed at the top of the dUTPase active sites, the exocyclic N4 group of dCTP interacts with His128 and Glu145. Glu145, conserved among dCTP deaminases but not dUTPases, has been shown to be essential for deamination but not for pyrophosphatase activity in mutagenesis experiments, and the corresponding residue in the dUTPases is hydrophobic and thus non-catalytic (Figure 2).10 Glu145 or His128 may be acting as a general base, activating a hydroxyl for nucleophilic attack at C4 of the dCTP pyrimidine ring (Figure 7). The absolute conservation of Glu145 but not His128 supports a more central role for the glutamate in catalysis and/or base specificity. Glu145, after abstraction of the water proton, can then protonate the nitrogen of the tetrahedral intermediate, thus facilitating loss of the exocyclic N4 group as ammonia. The partial charge on O2 and N3 could be neutralized by the nearby Arg122 side-chain, particularly if the cytosine base were tilted or rotated more than in our structures. Formation of the O4 carbonyl double bond would follow by tautomerization. It is unclear what specific role the DCD-DUT C-terminal residues may play in catalysis, although loss of these residues or of the corresponding motif V of the dUTPases has been shown to be detrimental to deamination and/or pyrophosphatase activity.11,25 Across the dUTPase superfamily, the C terminus is unstructured in the absence of substrate, as determined by susceptibility to proteolytic

degradation.11,25 Upon cleavage of 11 C-terminal residues, E. coli dUTPase displays impaired catalytic activity, although binding of an inhibitor, MgdUDP, is not affected. DCD-DUT likely also requires both substrate and metal to be bound for ordering of its C terminus. This region may cover the active site during catalysis, increasing affinity for substrate and retaining dUTP after dCTP deamination until pyrophosphate removal has occurred. This retention of the dUTP intermediate would overcome the lower binding affinity for dUTP relative to dCTP and thus increase enzyme efficiency in creating dUMP. Crystal structures have been determined for other deaminases, including the E. coli cytidine deaminase and the E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and yeast cytosine deaminases.19,20,33,34 Deamination mechanisms have been proposed for each of these, and all are metal-dependent enzymes with no apparent homology to dCTP deaminases. The structures of E. coli cytidine deaminase and B. subtilis and yeast cytosine deaminases have implicated similar mechanisms involving nucleophilic attack by a zinc-activated hydroxyl ion on the pyrimidine C4, followed by proton shuttling by a glutamate to remove the ammonia leaving group and allow formation of a double bond with oxygen at the 4 position.20,33,34 In contrast, E. coli cytosine deaminase has been shown to employ a catalytic Fe2þ in conjunction with a glutamate to activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack and subsequent deamination at the pyrimidine 4 position.19 No electron density of high s value, which would indicate the presence of an atom such as Fe2þ with more electrons than those typical of proteins, was observed near His128 or Glu145 in any of our structures. No non-bonded atoms were identified with coordination other than tetrahedral, as would be expected for water, indicating that Mg2þ was not present. Moreover, the E. coli dCTP deaminase has been reported to be devoid of bound metal, although the supporting data have not yet been published.11 We postulate that the mechanism of deamination by DCD-DUT is different from the metal-dependent mechanisms of cytosine and cytidine deaminases, and that the Glu145 side-chain replaces the catalytic metal ion in water activation (Figure 6). A candidate water molecule in position for nucleophilic attack has been located in the dCTP-bound active sites, roughly perpendicular to the plane of the pyrimi° ° dine base, 3.2 A from C4, 3.1 A from the N12 of ° from Glu145 O11 (Figure 7). His128, and 2.9 A Negative feedback control The cytidine and uridine bases are positioned differently in DCD-DUT from the uridine base in the dUTPases.2,23,24 This altered binding mode, in which the base is not oriented parallel with the motif III backbone, may also allow accommodation of dTTP in the active site.

893 ° structure, a large difference compared to the 0.7 A shift between dCTP and dUTP a phosphate positions. From the docked complex, a plausible mechanism for feedback inhibition by dTTP can be suggested. dTTP cannot bind in the same position as dCTP or dUTP, binding instead with its base flipped to make hydrophobic interactions with motif III and a single hydrogen bond with Ser118 of motif II. The shift in base position is propagated to the sugar and triphosphate moieties, thus moving the a and b phosphate groups out of position for phosphoester hydrolysis, resulting in competitive inhibition of dCTP or dUTP binding by formation of a non-productive complex. This level of regulation is important for metabolic enzymes, such as dCTP deaminases involved in conversion of dCTP to dTTP, as compared to the additional protective role played by strict dUTPases in hydrolyzing dUTP to avoid misincorporation into DNA. Conclusions We have determined the first structure of a dCTP deaminase, DCD-DUT, which also contains dUT° Pase activity, to 1.42 A. This high-resolution structure has revealed a hexameric assembly composed of a dimer of trimers. The individual trimers are arranged similarly to the canonical dUTPases. Each subunit is comprised of a b barrel of jelly roll configuration with an additional a helix, b arm, and a/b subdomain inserted that are unique from the dUTPases. The structures of DCD-DUT in com° plex with dCTP and dUTP, determined to 1.77 A ° , respectively, and complemented by and 2.10 A automated docking experiments, reveal the structural basis for specific active site recognition of dCTP and dUTP and suggest a mechanism for dCTP deamination involving residues His128 and Glu145 and an activated water. Docking experiments with dTTP suggest a mechanism for feedback inhibition reliant on an alternative mode of accommodation of the thymidine based on hydrophobic interactions with the 5-methyl group, resulting in non-productive positioning of the triphosphate. The results reported here provide key information on the fold, assembly, substrate and inhibitor interactions, and functional roles for unstructured regions that are fundamental to all dCTP deaminases and to future mutational analyses and a detailed molecular understanding of coupled deamination and pyrophosphatase activities within DCD-DUT.

suggest that the base is flipped in the opposite direction relative to cytidine or uridine positions (Figure 8). To avoid steric clash between the C5 methyl group and the side-chains of Ser118 or Arg122, the base would likely be turned in the opposite direction, such that the 5-methyl group could form van der Waals contacts with nearby hydrophobic residues and the dTTP N3 or O2 could hydrogen bond with the Ser118 Og. In DCDDUT:dTTP docked complexes, the 5-methyl group ° comes within 4 A of Ile134, Ile142 and Phe138. The isoleucine residues are somewhat conserved across the dUTPase superfamily, but position 138 is a tyrosine residue in dUTPases and a phenylalanine or tryptophan residue in dCTP deaminases, making this one of the few strongly demarcated positions in the superfamily (Figure 2). A hydrogen bond can also be formed between the exocyclic ° dTTP O2 and Ser118 Og (3.1 A, Figure 8). The change in dTTP base orientation with respect to motif III is propagated to the sugar and phosphate moieties more dramatically than seen with dUTP. In the docked DCD-DUT:dTTP complex, the a phosphate is shifted significantly ° (4.0 A) from its position in the DCD-DUT:dCTP

into the pET17b expression plasmid (Novagen) and introduced into E. coli BL21 Codon-Plus (DE3)-RIL cells. DCD-DUT production was induced with 28 mM lactose and cells were harvested after shaking for two hours at 37 8C. DCD-DUT was purified from cleared lysates by heat treatment (70 8C for 15 minutes) and chromatography, consisting of sequential MonoQ HR and Sephacryl S-200 HR columns. The purified protein was stored at 2 70 8C in 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 50 mM NaHepes (pH 7.2). DCD-DUT crystallization Crystallization of DCD-DUT was accomplished by the technique of hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion. Growth of crystals was found to result from decreasing the ionic strength of the solution, and sparse matrix crystallization trials revealed that a number of different mother liquors yielded small crystals. Heating the 10 ­20 mg/ml protein solution (stored in 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 50 mM NaHepes, pH 7.2) to 65 8C for ten minutes resulted in loss of overnucleation and promotion of crystal growth at room temperature, yielding crystals of much larger size (0.4 mm £ 0.4 mm £ 0.4 mm), which diffracted to ° ° higher resolution (1.4 A to 2.1 A). Crystals grew in a wide range of pH solutions (pH 4 ­8) and from low concentrations of a variety of precipitants. The best crystals resulted from a mother liquor of pure water, where 3 ml of water was added to 3 ml of 65 8C protein solution, and 0.75 ml water was placed in the reservoirs of hanging-drop experiments, which were incubated at 22 8C. Crystals grew within a few hours to a few days. Crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant of 35% ethylene glycol for ten seconds immediately prior to cryocooling and data collection. For structure determination by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD), crystals were soaked for 12 hours in 1 mM (NH4)2WS4, then soaked for ten seconds in 35% ethylene glycol and flash cooled to 2180 8C for data collection. In attempt to cocrystallize DCD-DUT with various nucleotide triphosphates, 30 mM nucleotide (dCTP or dUTP) was included in the mother liquor, as well as 5 mM EDTA or 2 mM MgCl2. Cocrystallization or changing the pH of the mother liquor had a variety of effects on overall crystal morphology, but all crystals indexed had identical space group (P213) and unit cell parameters. In some cases, 30 mM nucleotide was included in the cryoprotectant solution, which appeared to qualitatively increase the occupancy of nucleotide in the active-site pocket. DCD-DUT data collection and structure determination A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) ° ° beamline 9-2 for data from 30.0 A to 1.8 A, using ° l ¼ 1.2143, 1.2148, and 0.946 A. Selected data collection statistics are provided in Table 1. A high-resolution data set was collected on crystals of the apo DCD-DUT pro° tein on SSRL beamline 11-1 for data from 40.0 A to ° 1.42 A (Table 1). Data for dCTP- and dUTP-bound DCDDUT complexes were collected at SSRL beamline 9-2 to ° ° 1.77 A and 2.10 A resolution, respectively (Table 1). All X-ray intensity data were integrated using Denzo or HKL2000 and scaled with Scalepack or HKL2000.35 Phases were calculated using the anomalous signal from two specifically bound tungsten atoms with the program SOLVE.36 Heavy-atom positions were refined

with SHARP and density modification was carried out by SOLOMON.37 These calculations yielded an interpretable electron density map, which was fit using XtalView.38 Iterations of fitting with Xfit and refinement with CNS or SHELXL (high-resolution apo structure only) were then performed.39,40 Selected refinement statistics are given in Table 1. DCD-DUT:nuncleotide or DCD-DUT:PPi complex structure determination and automated docking Structures of DCD-DUT in complex with dCTP and dUTP were determined using either molecular replacement with the program AMoRe or difference Fourier methods. Because density for nucleotides was weak in most cases, nucleotides were positioned in the active site based on comparison with dUTPase:nucleotide active sites and mutagenesis and biochemical studies, which implicated particular residues, such as Asp135 and Glu145, in nucleotide binding. To reduce the amount of phase bias introduced by initial nucleotide positions, refined positions were compared to those obtained from automated docking, described in the following paragraph. AutoDock Tools was used to add polar hydrogen atoms, Kollman united atom charges, and solvation parameters to protein models.31 Standard AutoDock atomic radii and well-depth potentials were used for protein and ligand atoms. Cubic affinity grid maps were computed for each ligand atom type and electrostatic potentials using AutoGrid 3.0. For each ligand, AutoDock Tools was used to create a file specifying partial atomic charges and torsional degrees of freedom. Ligands were docked to the protein in 100 trials using a Lamarkian genetic algorithm as implemented in AutoDock 3.0. Each trial docking was initiated with a randomly generated population of ligand orientations. Standard AutoDock Lamarkian genetic algorithm parameters were used: 4% point mutation rate, 80% crossover rate, and 0.06 local search probability. Docked conformations were analyzed using Xfit.38 Protein Data Bank accession numbers Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with PDB IDs listed in Table 1.
