Regulation of catalytic function by molecular association: structure of phospholipase A2 from Daboia russelli pulchella (DPLA2) at Ê 1.9 A resolution
The crystal structure of phospholipase A2 from the venom of Daboia russelli pulchella has been re®ned to an R factor of Ê 0.216 using 17 922 re¯ections to 1.9 A resolution. The structure contains two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The overall conformations of the two molecules are essentially the same except for three regions, namely the calcium-binding loop including Trp31, the -wing and the C-terminal residues 119±131. Although these differences have apparently been caused by molecular packing, they seem to have functional relevance. Particularly noteworthy is the conformation of Trp31, which is favourable for substrate binding in one molecule as it is aligned with one of the side walls of the hydrophobic channel, whereas in the other molecule it is located at the mouth of the channel, thereby blocking the entry of substrates leading to loss of activity. This feature is unique to the present structure and does not occur in the dimers and trimers of other PLA2s.

1. Introduction
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2; E.C. 3.1.1.4) is a major component of snake venoms and induces more than one pharmacological effect in animals. PLA2s are broadly divided into two structural groups: class I, similar to pancreatic PLA2, are typically found in elapid venoms, whereas class II PLA2s are usually found in the crotalid and viperid venoms. Daboia russelli or Russell's viper is a class II PLA2 and contains at least four subspecies according to its geographic origin: D. russelli formosensis (Taiwan), D. russelli pulchella (Sri Lanka and South India), D. russelli russelli (North India and Pakistan) and D. russelli siamensis (China and southeast Asia) (Jayanthi & Gowda, 1988; Woodhams et al., 1990; Tsai et al., 1996). PLA2 speci®cally hydrolyzes the 2-acyl ester bond of 1,2-diacyl-3-sn-phospholipids (van Deenen & de Haas, 1963). The enzyme catalyzes reactions at a lipid±aqueous interface and the phospholipase activity is much higher on aggregated substrates such as monolayers, bilayers, micelles, membranes and vesicles than on monomolecular dispersed soluble substrates (Yuan et al., 1990). This phenomenon has been termed `interfacial catalysis' and includes interfacial binding of the enzyme and `activation steps' (Scott et al., 1990). Structural changes were observed in PLA2 upon its binding to membranes and were thought to be a prerequisite for enzyme activation (Tatulian et al., 1997). Thus, it is evident that modulation of membrane-associated PLA2 activity will in¯uence cellular functions such as chemostatis, cytotoxicity and cell differentiation. It has also been established that the interfacial absorption of PLA2 on membrane is driven by

electrostatic forces (Scott et al., 1994). Electrostatic interactions between the positive charges of the PLA2 recognition site and the negatively charged anionic head groups of phospholipids optimize the catalysis and are important for the adsorption and orientation of the enzyme at the lipid±water interface. The roles of structural changes in PLA2 upon its binding to membranes and the substrate-induced enzyme aggregation in PLA2 catalysis have not yet been clearly understood. In an attempt to provide a ®rm basis for structure-based PLA2 catalysis, we report here the three-dimensional structure of PLA2 from D. russelli pulchella (DPLA2) at Figure 1 Ê A region of the ®nal 2Fo À Fc electron-density map contoured at 1.5' and the corresponding 1.9 A resolution with two molecules in the re®ned model. The diagram was produced using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). crystallographic asymmetric unit. The lowresolution structure of DPLA2 was reported previously (Chandra et al., 2000). The present high-resolution analysis provides additional information, particularly on the dimerization interface involving the two crystallographically independent molecules in the structure and the speci®c differences between the two molecules.

2. Experimental
2.1. Purification and crystallization of DPLA2

Crude venom containing DPLA2 was obtained from Irula cooperative snake farm, Tamilnadu, India. The puri®cation was carried out as described previously (Chandra et al., 1999). Pure DPLA2 was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion method using a 15 mg mlÀ1 concentration of protein in 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer pH 6.5. It was equilibrated against 1.4 M ammonium sulfate in the presence of 3% dioxane. Very stable rectangular crystals of dimensions up to 0.4 Â 0.3 Â 0.2 mm were obtained at 298 K within two weeks.

2.2. Data collection

Ê The crystals diffracted to 1.9 A resolution. The data were collected on EMBL beamline X-11 at DESY, Hamburg with Ê ! = 0.98 A using a MAR345 imaging-plate scanner with 1.0 rotation for each image. A single crystal was mounted in a nylon loop and ¯ash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K using 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant while maintaining the ionic strength of the precipitant. The data were processed using the DENZO and SCALEPACK program packages (Otwinowski, 1993; Minor, 1993). The results of data collection and processing are given in Table 1. The data indicated a large mosaicity of 0.7 , presumably a consequence of freezing. The unit-cell parameters of the crystals were found to be slightly different from those reported earlier (Chandra et al., 2000). This could also be a consequence of the use of cryocooling in this study.

The starting model was the structure of DPLA2 previously Ê determined at 2.4 A resolution by the molecular-replacement method (Chandra et al., 2000), which was re®ned using the simulated-annealing method of the program X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992a) to an R factor of 18.8% in the resolution

Ê Ê range 20.0±2.4 A. Here, the new 1.9 A data set was used for extension of the resolution and improvement of the structure. In the ®rst step, re®nement was carried out with the program X-PLOR. In each step, 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps were calculated to improve the structures in the density maps using Ê the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The 2.4 A model without solvent molecules was used as the starting point. The resoluÊ tion was extended stepwise to 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 and 1.9 A. In the Ê re®nement step, water molecules were temporarily 1.9 A picked up from the Fo À Fc electron-density map contoured at 3' level. Upon re®nement, water molecules were rejected if they moved beyond the hydrogen-bond distance. At the end of the re®nement using X-PLOR, the model contained 1888 atoms corresponding to 242 amino acids from two crystallographically independent molecules and 213 water molecules. This model was further re®ned using the program CNS È È (Brunger et al., 1990, 1998; Brunger, 1992b) in the same resolution range. In this re®nement, the side chains of 17 residues were found to be discrete rotamers from inspection of both 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps. The split side chains of these residues were re®ned with an occupancy of 0.5, which was estimated from electron densities. The temperature factors of Ê water O atoms were in general lower than 40.0 A2, with a Ê maximum value of 88.7 A2. All the water molecules were re®ned with unit occupancies and variable temperature factors. A ®nal R factor of 21.6% and free R factor of 27.2% Ê were obtained in the resolution range 20.0±1.9 A (Table 2).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Quality of the model

The ®nal model consists of 1888 protein atoms from 242 amino-acid residues and 213 water molecules. The protein molecules have a geometry close to ideal, with r.m.s. deviaÊ tions of 0.006 A and 1.3 from standard values for bond lengths and angles, respectively. 87% of the residues were found in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran & Sasisekaran, 1968), while no residues were present in the disallowed regions.

of peaks 1 and 2 using void volume approximations are 28 and 14 kDa, respectively. The molecular weight of 28 kDa for peak 1 corresponds to the molecular weights of two DPLA2 molecules. The overall conformations of the two molecules are similar. The superimposition of molecule A on B shows an r.m.s. Ê deviation of 0.69 A for the C atoms. A plot of the deviation of  the C positions of molecules A and B against residue number is shown in Fig. 3. There are three important regions which show subtle differences in the conformations of the two molecules. These are the calcium-binding loop including Trp31 (residue 25±34), the -wing consisting of two antiparallel stands in the stretch residues 74±85 and residues 119±131. These regions are functionally important and are located at the molecular surface where conformational variability is more pronounced. Similar results were obtained in the recently determined structure of bovine pancreatic phosphoÊ lipase A2 carried out at 0.97 A resolution (Steiner et al., 2001).

3.2. Molecular association

The structure contains two crystallographically independent molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit. The molecules are associated through a broad interface between them. They form two strong intermolecular direct hydrogen bonds and a number of hydrogen bonds through water molecules. In addition, several hydrophobic interactions have also been observed between them. Thus, the association of the two molecules in DPLA2 is strong and presents a unique feature of molecular association. The two molecules were found to exist in association even in solution. The gel-®ltration pro®le of the mixture of DPLA2 and lysozyme using a Sephadex G-50 column (100.0 Â 1.6 cm) is shown in Fig. 2. The activity data indicates that peak 1 corresponds to DPLA2 and peak 2 belongs to lysozyme. Also, the estimation of molecular weights

The calcium-binding loop extends from Tyr25 to Gly33. The presence of two half cysteines and four glycine residues suggests a specially conformed backbone underlying an important function. In the present structure, calcium is not present but the calcium-binding site is occupied by a water molecule in each molecule. As seen from Fig. 4, the interactions of water with the loop and Asp49 in molecules A and B differ considerably. In molecule A, water is at hydrogenbonding distances from the four carbonyl O atoms of Tyr28, Gly30, Trp31 and Gly32, the two carboxyl O atoms O1 and O2 of Asp49, and a water molecule OW40. The temperature Ê factor of this water molecule for occupancy 1 is 25 A2. On the other hand, in molecule B there are only ®ve such distances involving the backbone O atoms of Tyr28, Gly30 and Gly32, one O atom O2 from the carboxyl group of Asp49 and one water molecule OW54. The temperature factor for this water Ê molecule is 45 A2. Despite this, the average temperature for Ê the atoms of the calcium-binding loop in molecule A is 40 A2, Ê which is more than that in molecule B (36 A2), indicating the effect of other forces that might be responsible for the stabilization and ¯exibility of the calcium-binding loops in the two molecules. For example, Trp31 of molecule B adopts the conformation with a 11 angle of À76.5 in order to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond through its N4 with Asn54 O2. On the other hand, the side chain of Trp31 of molecule A adopts a conformation with a 11 torsion angle of À179.6 and protrudes into the interstitial solvent channels in the crystals. This conformation in molecule A leads to an arrangement in which the backbone O atom of Trp31 in molecule A points towards the interior of the loop while the corresponding O atom in molecule B is placed facing outward. Thus, the side chains of Trp31 in molecules A and B are disposed in opposite directions. Owing to the proximity of the Trp31 side chain to the hydrophobic channel, its conformation has a direct in¯uence on the binding of substrates and inhibitors to PLA2.

are differently oriented. The -turn in molecule B is considerably distorted, leading to a different orientation of the side chains of Asn79 (Fig. 5). This seems to have been caused by intermolecular interactions of Asn79 of molecule B through N1 and O2 with Ile82 CO and Lys100 N4 of a symmetryrelated molecule. In molecule A, the side chain of Asn79 points towards the solvent. These differences, although apparently associated with the packing of the molecules in the crystalline state, are linked to a speci®c function.

The red circles show the position of Trp31 in molecule B, while the green ones indicate that of molecule A. Green circles containing Trp31 (A) are exposed to the solvent while red circles containing Trp31 (B) are completely blocked by molecular packing.

The C-terminal segment (Leu119±Cys133) adopts an extended conformation in both molecules. However, the conformations of the molecules differ substantially, even though the C-terminal residue Cys133 is linked to Cys50 through a disul®de bridge which is conserved in all group II PLA2s. One of the carboxyterminal O atoms of Cys133 of molecule B forms an intramolecular bridge via a water molecule OW85 with the CO of its disul®de-bridge partner Cys50, whereas Cys133 of molecule A is involved in an intermolecular interaction with the CO of a symmetry-related Trp31 (B) (Fig. 6).

The PLA2 molecules tend to associate at high concentrations and exist as dimers (Keith et al., 1981; Perbandt et al., 1997) and trimers (Segelke et al., 1998). The same is true of DPLA2. As described earlier, the differences between the two molecules involve the crucial Trp31, the -wing and the C-terminal region. The changes in Trp31 and the C-terminal region are interlinked through the intermolecular water bridge between Cys133 O and Trp31 O of a symmetry-related molecule B. It is noteworthy that Trp31 and Asn79 of molecule B are involved in strong intermolecular interactions while the corresponding parts of molecule A are exposed to solvent (Fig. 7). Unlike the formations of dimers and trimers in other PLA2 structures where the hydrophobic channels are shielded by each other, the association of two crystallographically independent molecules in the present structure places them back to back in such a way that the binding surfaces are fully accessible. However, the pairs of two crystallographically independent molecules are packed in such a manner in the crystalline state that the entry to the putative catalytic site of molecule B is blocked by other symmetry-related molecules. However, the hydrophobic channel of molecule A opens into the solvent region, making it accessible to substrates and inhibitors (Fig. 7). In addition, the conformations of Trp31 in molecules A and B differ drastically owing to the involvement of Trp31 in the strong intramolecular interactions in A and intermolecular forces in B. Futhermore, the side chain of

Trp31 in A moves away from the binding surface, leaving it wide open for easy diffusion of the substrate (Fig. 8). On the other hand, the intermolecular interactions involving Trp31 of molecule B induce its side chain to adopt a conformation in which the mouth of the binding channel is hindered by the side chain of Trp31 (Fig. 8). The shortest distance between any two atoms from the Trp31 side chain and that on the opposite wall Ê Ê of the hydrophobic channel is 4.7 A in molecule B and 8.3 A in molecule A. Therefore, it may be concluded that the binding site in molecule A is accessible while it is completely blocked in molecule B. This is a signi®cant ®nding and explains the observations of lower activities in certain PLA2s owing to molecular associations.
