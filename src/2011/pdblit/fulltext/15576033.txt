Abstract The two known estrogen receptors, ER and ER , are hormone inducible transcription factors that have distinct roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The natural ligand, 17 -estradiol (E2), binds with high affinity to both ER and ER . However, a close analogue, 16 -iodo-17 -estradiol (16 IE2) showed about 10-fold selectivity for ER over ER . From X-ray studies, it has been shown that the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of the two receptors are strikingly similar, and that only two changes fall within the binding cavity (ER Leu384 to ER Met336, and ER Met421 to ER Ile373). To understand the molecular basis for the ER selectivity of 16 IE2, mutants and chimeras of ER and ER were generated, and ligand-binding and transactivation functions were studied. The ER Leu384 Met mutant behaved like ER WT in the presence of 16 IE2; whereas the profile of the ER Met421 Ile mutant was similar to that of ER WT. The ER mutant Ile373 Met behaved like ER with 16 IE2. The results clearly demonstrate the role of ER Met421 in the ER selectivity of 16 IE2. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Estrogens regulate many important physiological processes, and their targets include reproductive tissues, the cardiovascular system, bone, and the brain [1­3]. Two estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, ER , and ER , encoded by two different genes, mediate the actions of estrogens [4­7]. The two ER subtypes are similar in their structural organization. They contain an amino terminal domain that contributes to transactivation function; a central domain responsible for the specific DNA binding, dimerization and nuclear localization; and a C-terminal domain involved in ligand-binding and ligand-dependent transactivation function. The two estrogen receptors share about 95% homology in their DNA binding domains, but their ligand-binding domains (LBD) share only 56% of amino acid sequence identity [5­9]. The two ERs bind to the natural ligand 17 -estradiol (E2) with high and nearly equal affinity. Extensive binding studies utilizing E2, its analogues and synthetic ligands with ER and various mutants of ER ligand-binding domain (LBD) have

provided a detailed description of the ER pharmacophore [10,11]. Molecular modeling studies have provided valuable information of the residues involved in the interaction of E2 with the ER receptor [10­12]. The crystal structures of the LBD of ER and ER with well-known agonists and antagonists have been resolved, and the structures have provided a molecular basis for the distinctive pharmacophore of ER and its binding properties and also have provided the structural evidence for the mechanism of antagonism [13­15]. A number of natural and synthetic ER ligands display marked differences in the binding affinity and activation of the estrogen receptor. Several ER sub-type selective ligands have been identified. Some of the compounds, both steroidal and non-steroidal, are more potent in activating ER than ER [16­19]. A novel class of ER selective ligands that are full antagonists of ER has been identified [20]. Ligands that are ER selective are also known. Several phytoestrogens preferentially bind and activate ER [21,22]. A non-steroidal estrogen that is considerably more potent on ER than on ER has also been discovered [20]. A close analogue of E2, 16 -iodo-17 -estradiol (16 IE2) has shown 10-fold selectivity toward ER [21,23,24]. In

order to understand the molecular basis for this selectivity and to identify the determinants involved in the ER subtype-selectivity, functional studies were performed with mutants of ER and ER and their chimeras. The results of the ligand-binding and transactivation studies show that residue Met421 in ER plays a significant role in the ER selectivity of 16 IE2.

conditions using ER WT as the template DNA. The purified PCR fragment was digested with BglII and XbaI and along with the HindIII­BglII fragment of the 5 end of ER was cloned into HindIII­XbaI fragment of pcDNA3 expression vector. 2.1.5. Isolation of ER and ER chimera plasmids The ER sequence contained a unique EcoRV site in the DNA binding domain. A derivative of ER without any changes in amino acids was generated by changing GGCTACCAT (Gly, Tyr, and His) to GGATATCAT( Gly, Tyr, and His) resulting in the generation of a unique EcoRV site in the DNA binding domain corresponding to ER (Fig. 1A). The ER specific primer GTGTGCAATGACTATGCTTCAGGATATCATTATG with desired changes, along with the ER 3 primer with an XhoI site, was used to amplify the ER sequence, and the purified, amplified fragment was digested with BSrD1 and XhoI and was cloned into the pcDNA 3 vector along with the BamHI and BsrD1 fragment from the ER plasmid. The chimera of ER and ER was generated by switching the BamHI­EcoRV fragments of the two receptors. The sequences of all of the above constructs were confirmed by sequencing to assure accuracy. 2.2. Bacterial expression of ligand binding domain of ER WT, ER mutants( Leu384 Met, Met421 Ile), and ER WT The LBD of ER was amplified using PCR primer 5 primer AGCCATATGATGAAAGGTGGGATACGAAAAG and 3 primer ATAGGATCCTTATTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCTTTGTAGTCGACTGTGGCAGGGAAACCCTCTGCCT and using the conditions mentioned above. The purified PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and was cloned into the corresponding sites of pET 15b vector. The ER LBD mutant plasmids were generated by utilizing the corresponding ER mutant plasmid as the template for PCR amplification. The plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) and protein expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG at 25  C for 2­3 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl. The cell suspension was lysed using the French Press. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and was stored at -70  C and was used for ligand-binding studies. 2.2.1. Ligand binding assay Ligand binding reactions were performed in Wallace high binding cross talk free 96-well plates containing 2 nM [3 H] 17 -estradiol (NEN, Boston, MA), unlabelled compounds and 1 g crude lysate in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 1 mM EDTA. After incubation at room temperature for 5­18 h, unbound material was removed by rinsing, and bound DPMs were determined by liquid scintillation counting [25].

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Plasmids and mutagenesis ER WT cDNA was cloned into BamHI­XhoI sites of pcDNA 3(Invitrogen). The ER coding sequence was cloned as a BamHI­XbaI fragment into a pcDNA 3-expression vector. To generate ER mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was performed utilizing primers containing the desired mutation followed by amplification of the ER mutant segment using PCR and the subsequent replacement of the amplified ER segment into the ER WT plasmid. 2.1.1. Mutation of ER Leu384 Met The following primers were used. 5 primer CACCTTCTAGAATGTGCCTGAATGGAGATCCTG 3 primer GAATAGGGCCCGCTAGCTGCATGCTCGAGTTATCAG. ER WT plasmid was used as a template in the PCR reaction, and the following conditions were used: 94  C--3 min, 5 cycles of 94  C--30 s, 50  C--30 s, 72  C--90 s, and 20 cycles of 94  C--30 s, 55  C--30 s, and 72  C--90 s, and finally, 72  C--10 min. The PCR product was purified on a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen), digested with XbaI and ApaI, and the gel purified fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites in ER WT cDNA plasmid. 2.1.2. Mutation of ER Met421 Ile 5 primer CAAAGGGATCCACCATGACCATGACCCTCCACACC and 3 primer with Met to Ile codon mutation CATGTCGAAGATCTCCACGATGCCCTCTACACA were used for PCR amplification utilizing the conditions described above. The purified PCR product was digested with BglII and XbaI and the gel-purified fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites in the ER WT plasmid. 2.1.3. Mutations of ER Leu384 Met and Met421 Ile The mutant plasmids were generated in a similar fashion as the Met421 Ile mutant, except, Leu384 Met ER mutant plasmid DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification. 2.1.4. Mutation of ER Ile373 Met The mutant plasmid was generated by a similar approach as described above. The following primers were used: 5 primer TCCAGATCTTGTTCTGGACAGGGATGAGGGGAAATGCGTAGAAGGAATGCTGG and 3 primer GGATCTAGAGTCGACGCGTCACTGAGACTGAGGGTTCTGG. PCR amplification was performed with the above

2.3. Cell culture and transient transfection The HepG2 cell line was routinely cultured in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The HepG2 cells (3 × 105 /well) were plated in a 24-well tissue culture dish in phenol red-free MEM containing 10% charcoal treated fetal bovine serum. The cells in

each well were transfected with 50 ng of receptor plasmid, 0.5 g of 2X ERE-tk-luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.25 g of pRSV -galactosidase plasmid as internal control and 0.2 g of calf thymus DNA in a volume of 50 l using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After incubation of the cells with the DNA for 4 h, the cells were glycerol shocked with 20% glycerol in 1 × Tris saline pH 7.9 for 1 min and washed

with media containing 2% charcoal/dextran treated serum. The cells were then treated with ligand in maintenance media. After 20 h of incubation, the cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were assayed for luciferase and -galactosidase activity. The ER activity was determined by normalizing the luciferase activity with -galactosidase activity as described previously [7]. 2.3.1. Homology model of ER LBD The homology model of ER LBD was built using the LOOK version 3.5 software package.1 The X-ray structure of ER [13] was selected as a template to predict the 3-dimensional structure of LBD of ER . The alignment of the ER LBD sequence (residues 258­500) with the ER LBD sequence (residues 305­549) was done using the automated alignment feature within the program, and the final model was generated using the segment matching modeling method [26]. 2.3.2. Computational methodology Published coordinates for ER complexed with E2 were obtained from the protein data bank (pdb) [13, 1ERE (pdb code)]. Coordinates for the ER ­E2 complex were obtained from an in-house ER ­E2 complex structure [27]. All docking calculations were performed using the QXP software package [28]. After adding explicit hydrogens using the hadd/hopt utilities, the X-ray ligand was minimized in the active site. The resulting structure was used as an input to a series of constrained simulated annealing dynamics calculations, wherein all atoms were allowed to move in a 0.1 Å radius flat potential after which a 20 kJ/mol/A2 quadratic constant penalty was applied. Successive runs where the atoms were constrained in increments of 0.1 Å radius were performed until the energy of the complex started to increase. The resulting structure was then kept rigid, and the complex was subjected to 1000 steps of Monte Carlo search (MCDOCK) to explore all of the poses of the ligand [28]. Visualization of X-ray structures and docking results was performed using the InsightII software package.2

and ER Leu384/ER Met336 on the beta face. Subsequent X-ray structures of the ER /Genestein complex (15), as well as in-house ER /E2 structures (solved at a resolution of 2.4 Å, (27)), confirm that these two amino acids are indeed different in the binding pocket. 3.2. Ligand induced responsiveness of WT, mutant receptor ER and ER The transactivation function of the WT and mutant ER and ER receptors with E2 and 16 IE2 were studied in HepG2 cells utilizing a 2X ERE-tk-luciferase reporter, and the results are given in Fig. 2A­H. ER WT showed about an 80-fold increase in luciferase activity in the presence of 100 nmol/l E2, and the pattern of activation with 16 IE2 was very similar to that with E2 (Fig. 2A). ER WT was about five-fold less active in its ability to trans-activate the ERE-tk-luciferase reporter in the presence of E2. The steroidal 16 IE2 was less active with ER -WT compared to E2 and showed about two- and eight-fold less activity at 10 and 100 nmol/l, respectively. There was a right shift in the transactivation profile compared to E2 transactivation (Fig. 2B). To determine the extent to which the selectivity of 16 IE2 depends on the LBD versus other receptor domains, E2 and 16 IE2 were tested against two ER chimeras in which only the LBDs are switched within the context of the remainder of the receptor. The ER /ER chimera gave a similar transactivation profile with E2 and 16 IE2, and the pattern was very similar to that of ER WT (Fig. 2C). With ER /ER , 16 IE2 was about four-fold less active than E2, and the pattern was similar to that of ER WT (Fig. 2D). The data suggest that the LBD of ER is the major factor in determining the selectivity of 16 IE2 for the ER subtype. Several reports, including the X-ray crystallographic studies, have identified the amino acid residues that are in close contact with the ligand. Of these, all but two are identical in ER and ER , and the two residues in ER , Leu384, and Met421, are replaced by Met336 and Ile373, respectively in ER . To determine the role of these amino acids in the selectivity of ER for 16 IE2, ER mutants with Leu384 and Met421 replaced by the corresponding ER residues (Met and Ile, respectively) were generated. The ER mutant Leu384 Met was about 60% as active as WT ER . Both E2 and 16 IE2 were equally active and gave a transactivation profile similar to the ER WT receptor (Fig. 2E). The mutation of ER at 421 from Met to Ile did not affect the transactivation function with E2. However, 16 IE2 was less active compared to E2, and the pattern of the transactivation profile was very similar to that of ER WT (Fig. 2F). The results suggest that methionine at 421 is critical for the efficient transactivation function of ER WT, and its conservative change to isoleucine residue affects the binding of 16 IE2 (see below) and its transactivation function. The ER mutant with two mutations (ER Leu384 Met, Met421 Ile) behaved in a similar fashion to the ER single mutant, ER Met421 Ile (Fig. 2G). If the role of ER

The homology model of the ER LBD was built based on the LOOK package, and the results showed that the binding site of ER reveals only two amino acid differences within a shell of 6 Å around the ligand pocket. The two amino acid differences are ER Met421/ER Ile373 on the alpha face of the steroid ring

Met421 is critical for the efficient binding of 16 IE2 and transactivation function, then a change of Ile at 373 to Met in the ER LBD should change the transactivation profile of 16 IE2 from ER to ER . A mutation of Ile at 373 to

Met was generated and tested for its transactivation function (Fig. 2H). The mutation had no effect on the transactivation function with E2 compared to ER WT. However, 16 IE2 was equally as active as E2, and the transactivation profile

was very similar to ER WT. The loss of ER selectivity for 16 IE2 with the mutation of Met421 Ile indicates the importance of Met421 for ER selectivity toward 16 IE2. Moreover, the gain of selectivity for ER by changing Ile373 Met confirms the importance of the methionine residue in the LBD for the sub-type selective interaction of 16 IE2. 3.3. Ligand binding The binding of ligands, E2 and 16 IE2, was studied using bacterially expressed LBDs of ER , as well as mutants of ER and ER receptors, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Radioinert E2 inhibited the binding of [3 H] 17 estradiol to the ligand binding domains of ER and ER with the same potency, as expected given the nearly identical binding affinity to both receptors [22]. The ligand, 16 IE2, showed binding very similar to E2 to the ER LBD (Fig. 3A), whereas it was 15 times less potent on ER (Fig. 3B). While ER mutant Leu384 Met showed overall reduced binding (Fig. 3C), the binding affinities for E2 and 16 IE2 were similar, suggesting that the mutation Leu384 Met does not discriminate between E2 and 16 IE2. However, the ER mutant Met421 Ile showed reduced binding of 16 IE2 compared to E2, and the pattern of the binding of the two ligands was similar to that of ER . The above binding studies indicate that the methionine residue at 421 of the LBD of ER plays an important role in the interaction with 16 IE2 and its selectivity toward ER . Mutation of this Met to Ile as seen in ER , results in reduced binding to 16 IE2 (Fig. 3D).

The activity of the ER activation function domain 2 (AF2) is dependent upon the integrity of a hydrophobic interaction surface generated by conserved amino acid changes in H3 H5/6 and H12, which is critical for the interaction of members of the p160 coactivator family [13,14]. The structure of the ER LBD in the presence of phytoestrogen genistein and raloxifene has also been determined [15]. The overall structure of the ER LBD is very similar to that of ER . Twenty-two residues, predominantly hydrophobic in character, line the cavity and interact with the bound ligand. The contact residues are identical to those of ER with two changes: amino acids Leu384 and Met421 are replaced by Met336 and Ile373. The binding cavity in the ER -genistein complex is slightly smaller than that of ER ­E2, and this reduction is primarily due to the replacement of leucine at position 336 in ER with a bulkier methionine in ER . The methionine 336 residue in the ER LBD may result in the tight packing of ligand in ER [15]. As part of our effort to understand the molecular basis for the non-selective nature of E2 and the ER selectivity of 16 IE2, we have analyzed the mutation results using molecular modeling. 4.1. Estradiol is a non-selective ligand Insights into the non-selective nature of the E2 ligand can be rationalized from examining the X-ray structures of ER /E2 [13] and ER /E2 [27]. The overall topology of our in-house ER /E2 X-ray structure is similar to that of the published ER /E2 structure [13] with H12 packed against H3, H5/H6 and H11 in a conformation that has been observed in agonist-bound structures. The overall RMS for all of the backbone atoms of these two structures is 0.89 Å. In both of these structures, E2 adopts a similar orientation in the ligand-binding pocket with the phenolic A ring making critical hydrogen bonds with Arg and Glu residues at one end of the cavity, and the 17 ­OH group hydrogen bonding to His at the other end. The rigid framework of E2 does not allow any of its atoms to approach any of the residue substitutions within either of the ER subtypes. Fig. 4A and B shows the X-ray structures of ER /E2 and ER /E2 along with critical residues in the binding pocket. The alpha face of both of these complexes shows that the closest distance between the ligand (16C of the D ring) and the substituted residues is very similar (4.2 and 4.3 Å). This is not the case for the beta face of the region where distances of 4.4 Å in ER and 3.5 Å in ER are observed from the closest atom, which in this case is the 18 methyl group to the substituted residues. Although the distance of 3.5 Å is shorter in the case of ER , we believe it does not contribute to the energy of the complex. Our QM calculations [27] performed on model systems suggest that both of these distances fall in the region of a relatively flat potential with no change in relative energy. Thus, we conclude that these distances do not influence the selectivity of E2 toward the ER subtypes and support the results of our mutation studies.

4. Discussion Several approaches, including molecular modeling, affinity labeling and site directed mutagenesis, have been taken to formulate the general model for the interaction that occurs between the receptor and its ligands upon the formation of the receptor­ligand complex. Utilizing the above approaches and close structural analogs of E2, the orientation and residue contacts of E2 with ER have been predicted [10­12]. The crystal structures for the LBD of ER bound to E2, raloxifene, 4OH-tamoxifen, and diethylstilbestrol (DES), as well as a peptide derived from the coactivator GRIP1, have also been elucidated [13­15]. These crystal structures have provided the details of the pharmacophore for the ER and its binding properties. The estrogen-binding cavity is completely partitioned with an external environment and is buried deeply within the hydrophobic core of the LBD and surrounded by parts of helixes H3, H6, H8, H11, and H12. Hormone recognition is achieved through a combination of specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the core residues and the non-polar E2 skeleton. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes conformational changes whereby the C-terminal H12 is realigned over the ligand-binding pocket against H3, H5/6 and H11.

All of the figures were generated using the Insight II software package .

4.2. 16IE2 is an ER selective ligand Based on binding studies, several reports have shown that 16 IE2 is an ER selective ligand, with selectivity ranging from 10- to 30-fold in favor of ER over ER [23]. The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that both E2 and 16 IE2 showed a similar binding and transactivation profile with ER . However, with ER , 16 IE2 bound with less affinity as shown earlier [23], and also produced less transactivation function compared to E2, thus, demonstrating its selectivity toward ER in both binding and transactivation function. In the present study, we show that the change of ER Met421 to isoleucine changes the behavior of 16 IE2 from ER to the ER type. The corresponding change of ER Ile373 to Met makes it behave like ER with the16 IE2 ligand. The result clearly demonstrates that Met421 is an important determinant in the ER selectivity of 16 IE2.

In an effort to understand the origin of the ER selectivity of 16 IE2 (10-fold in activation and 20- to 30-fold in binding), docking studies were performed [28] within the binding site of ER and ER . The results of the docking studies (Fig. 4C and D) show 16 IE2 adopts similar orientations in both ER and ER sites with the 16 -iodo group in the vicinity of the ER Met421/ER Ile373 residue. While both docked orientations have the hydroxyl group of the A ring interacting with the Arg and Glu residues, the 17 ­OH distance in 16 IE2/ER complex is much further i.e. 3.9 Å versus 3.0 Å from the His residue. This may be a result of the iodine atom (C­I bond length = 2.13 Å) experiencing an unfavorable steric interaction with the ER Ile373 residue, which would position the 17 ­OH group further away from His475. This interaction is roughly estimated to contribute approximately a 7- to 20-fold loss in binding when one compares E2 versus 17-deoxy-E2 [27,29]. Thus, one might expect a similar or a smaller loss

in potency for the 16 IE2 ligand with ER on account of this longer distance. In addition, a distance of 3.5 Å from iodine to sulfur of Met of ER 421 in the docked orientation of 16 IE2 represents a favorable interaction in the ER site according to quantum mechanical calculations [27]. Thus we believe that an unfavorable steric interaction between the iodo group and ER Ile373, as well as an attractive interaction between the iodo group and ER Met421 both contribute to the selectivity of 16 IE2. Several subtype-selective ligands of ER and ER have been described, and the selectivity mainly revolves around very few residues of the LBD. Diarylpropionitrile (DPN) is an ER -selective ligand, and a single ER point mutation, Leu384 Met, is largely sufficient to switch the DPN response of this ER to that of the ER type; however, more extensive studies with mutants have shown the residues in helix three are also important in achieving the full ER selectivity of DPN [20]. A recent study with the enantiomers of indanesterol (IA) have shown that although the binding of IA­R and IA­S was not affected by ER Leu384 Met mutation, IA­R showed higher potency in activating Leu384 Met mutated ER and WT ER , demonstrating that a single residue in the LBD determines the stereoselectivity of ER and ER for indenosterol ligands [30]. The success with the synthesis of many ER sub-type specific ligands due to the specific interaction with a limited number of LBD amino acids indicates that the approach can be used to design selective ligands for ER and ER receptors. Comparison of structure-function relationships specific for the very similar yet distinct ER and ER subtypes of the ER offers a unique opportunity for dissecting the role of ligand-binding and ultimately mediating biological function. Detailed studies involving the combination of structural and functional analysis of wild-type, as well as mutated ER and ER bound to subtype-specific ligands, coupled with molecular modeling and crystallographic studies will help to develop ER subtype-specific ligands. These studies will provide the basis for the structure-based design of improved agonists and antagonist as tools to probe the function of estrogen receptors and also for the treatment of estrogen-related diseases.
