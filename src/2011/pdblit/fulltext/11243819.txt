Abstract Reversible protein phosphorylation is essential for the regulation of numerous cellular functions and differentiation. The haemo-¯agellated parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent for African trypanosomiasis undergoes various stages of cellular differentiation during its digenetic life cycle. A complete cDNA of a unique serine/threonine phosphatase type ®ve (TbPP5) was cloned and characterized from T. brucei. TbPP5 contains an open reading frame of 1416 bp that encodes a protein of about 53 kDa and exists as a single copy gene in the T. brucei genome. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 45±48% overall identity and 60±65% similarity with protein phosphatase 5 H s (PP5) from different species. Analysis of the primary sequence revealed that TbPP5 contains three TPR motifs at the N-terminal region (amino acid residues 7±107) while the phosphatase catalytic domain occurs in the C-terminal region (amino acid residues 210±410). A TbPP5 cDNA hybridized with a transcript of 2.5 kb which is present at similar levels in the procyclic and the bloodstream forms. However, the level of expression of the TbPP5 protein (52 kDa) detected by an antibody developed against a recombinant protein produced in E. coli was about 2-fold higher in the procyclic than the bloodstream form. The TbPP5 transcript level gradually decreased in cells grown in the logarithmic phase to the stationary phase in culture. Moreover, 18 h serum starvation of the procyclic forms decreased the level of the speci®c transcript about 3-fold suggesting that this protein may play a role during the active growth phase of the organism. The recombinant protein showed phosphatase activity which was stimulated about 2.6-fold by arachidonic acid with half-maximal activity at 75 mM. Indirect immuno-¯uoresence of permeabilized cells revealed that the protein is localized in the cytosol and the nucleus This is the ®rst report for the identi®cation of a type 5 serine/threonine protein phosphatase in an ancient eukaryote such as T. brucei. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the etiological agent of African sleeping sickness in humans and a similar disease called nagana in cattle, vascillates between proliferative and non-proliferative growth phases during its digenetic life cycle (World Health Organization, 1986;

Vickerman, 1985). The parasite is transmitted from one mammal to another by the bite of the Glossina species of the tsetse ¯y. Within the insect vector the procyclic trypomastigotes (Pro), a proliferative form of the parasite, differentiate to non-dividing metacyclic trypomastigotes. Upon entering the mammalian bloodstream, they are transformed again into rapidly dividing long-slender bloodstream trypomastigotes (Bs). The Bs form cells live extracellularly in the blood and in tissue ¯uids of the vertebrate host, and ®nally invade the central nervous system, causing lesions in the brain and sleeping sickness. In the latter stage of the infection, the parasites transform into non-dividing stumpy bloodstream forms which then complete their life-cycle upon entering into the insect gut via a blood-meal (Vickerman, 1985). In higher eukaryotes, the reversible phosphorylation of proteins on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues plays a key role in the integration of the signals involved in cellular

proliferation and differentiation (Cohen, 1997; Barford, 1996). While little is known about the signals and the molecular mechanisms involved in trypanosome differentiation and proliferation, recent developments have revealed that, like other eukaryotes, protein phosphorylation and signal transduction pathways are associated in controlling this complex process (Naula and Seebeck, 2000; Parsons and Ruben, 2000). Several stage regulated protein kinases have been cloned and characterized (Hua and Wang, 1997; Gale et al., 1994; Mottram and Smith, 1995; Graham et al., 1998; Affranchino et al., 1993), and the role of cyclic AMP and adenylate cyclase during parasite differentiation has also been documented (Vassella et al., 1997). However, information about protein phosphatases and their function is limited in this organism. Serine/threonine phosphatase type I, and 2A have been cloned from T. brucei (Erondu and Donelson, 1991; Evers and Cornelissen, 1990), and it has been found that in T. brucei rhodesience, okadaic acid, a speci®c inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A downregulates the steady state level of beta-tubulin mRNA by decreasing its stability (Lie and Donelson, 1995). In addition, a life-cycle stage regulated, plasma membrane bound protein tyrosine phosphatase activity has been cloned and characterized from T. brucei (Bakalara et al., 2000). Eukaryotic protein phosphatases (PPs) are structurally and functionally diverse enzymes that are represented by three distinct gene families. Two of these, the PPP and PPM families, dephosphorylate phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues, whereas the protein tyrosine phosphtases (PTPs) dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine (Cohen, 1997; Barford, 1996). The PPP family includes the signature phosphatases, PP1, PP2A and PP2B (calceneurin, Ca 21calmodulin-regulated PP), while the PPM family comprises the Mg 21-dependent protein phosphatases, which include PP2C and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (Cohen, 1997; Barford, 1996). More recently, many other phosphatases have been discovered in the PPP family and these are PP4, PP5 and PP6 (Barford, 1996). Like PP1, PP2A and PP2B, these are also present in all mammalian tissues examined. PP4 and PP6 are similar to the PP2A subfamily on the basis of their catalytic domain structure. Mammalian and Drosophila PP5 and yeast Ppt1 are grouped into a separate subfamily not only on the basis of their catalytic domain, but also because they all possess a fused amino-terminal domain that contains three to four tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs (Barford, 1996) The TPR motif is a 34-amino acid degenerate repeated motif that is known to mediate protein protein interaction (Lamb et al., 1995). The TPR domain of PP5 is involved in mediating interactions between PP5 and hsp90 within an hsp90-glucocorticoid receptor complex, as well as with the kinase domain of the ANP-guanylate cyclase receptor in vivo. This is consistent with a role of PP5 in signal transductions (Silverstein et al., 1997; Chinkers, 1994). PP5 also interacts with CDC16 and CDC27, which are tetratricopeptide repeat motif containing subunits of the anaphase promoting complex. This may indicate that

PP5 plays a role in the regulation of the activity of this complex (Ollendorff and Donoghue, 1997). Human PP5 appears to participate in cell growth. The inhibition of PP5 expression in human A549 lung carcinoma cells by an antisense oligonucleotide resulted in marked anti-proliferative activity (Zuo et al., 1998). TPR domains are also involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase activity of PP5 by interacting with polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (Sinclair et al., 1999; Chen and Cohen, 1997). In this study I have cloned the T. brucei PP5 (TbPP5) and analyzed the expression of the gene and its protein product. 2. Methods and materials 2.1. Cells Trypanosoma brucei brucei LUMP 1026 procyclic forms were cultured at 278C in modi®ed Cunningham's medium (BSM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Cunningham, 1977). Bs forms were isolated from infected male Sprague± Dawley rats, as described (Lanham, 1968). Bs trypanosomes were also maintained in culture using HMI-9 medium, as described (Carruthers and Cross, 1992). 2.2. Screening of cDNA expression library, Northern and Southern blot analysis A PCR product (500 bp) was generated from T. brucei genomic DNA using primers designed from the sequence of a cosmid clone (6N9) obtained from the T. brucei genome data base during a homology search. The forward and the reverse primers used to generate this PCR product were (5 H TCTTACAAAACTCCACCTTCGCC-3 H ) and (5 H -GGGGGTCATTATCAACTTTTCCG-3 H ), respectively. The PCR product was cloned and sequenced for further veri®cation and also used as a probe to screen a l±ZAPII cDNA library of the T. brucei Bs form according to standard techniques (Sambrook et al., 1994). For northern analysis total RNA was isolated from Bs and Pro trypanosomes using Trizol reagent (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and was precipitated with 2 M LiCl. RNAs were fractionated in formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Sambrook et al., 1994). The PCR-ampli®ed coding region (ORF) of TbPP5 and a cloned tubulin gene were used as probes. Procyclic trypanosomes were harvested for total RNA isolation after incubation at the normal growth temperature for 18 h in serum depleted BSM medium, and at different time points of the usual growth phases in serum containing medium. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was isolated from T. brucei as described (Sambrook et al., 1994) and 5±10 mg were used in genomic digests. Digested products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose (Sambrook et al., 1994) and probed with the TbPP5 ORF. The ®nal wash for both Southern and northern blots was in 0.1 £ SSC containing 0.1%

SDS at 608C for 30 min Tbpp5-speci®c mRNA levels were quantitated by phosphoroimaging and normalized with the values obtained for the tubulin probe. 2.3. 5 H and 3 H end ampli®cation of the cDNA clone To identify the 5 H end of the mature transcript, a splice leader (SL) primer (5 H CTGAATTCGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTG3 H ) and a TbPP5 clone speci®c antisense primer (5 H GCGGATGCCTTGTGGTAATAGG3 H ) were used to amplify the cDNA fragment from the mRNA of T. brucei Bs and Pro trypanosomes. The ®rst strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo dT as the primer with MuMLV (murine leukemia virus) reverse transcriptase (PE biosystem, Norwalk, CT) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The SL primer was generated from the 39 nucleotide sequence present at the 5 H end of all trypanosome mRNAs (Nilsen, 1995). The 3 H end of the TbPP5 cDNA was ampli®ed using a 3 H RACE ampli®cation kit (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the supplied protocol. The gene-speci®c primers chosen were P1) at 1791±1814 bp (5 H CTCTCGTGCTTGYFCTTCTTTTCC3 H ) and P2) at 1888±1908 bp (5 H ATTCGATTTCTCCATCGGACG3 H ) of the sequence of the TbPP5 clone. PCR products generated by 5 H and 3 H RACE were subcloned in the pGEM w-T vector system (Promega, Madison, WI). Five clones for each product were sequenced. 2.4. DNA sequencing and computer analysis Sequencing of the cDNA clones and the PCR products was done either by using a Sequencing kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) or by an automated DNA sequencer (ABI model 377) and deposited in GenBank (accession number AF 305085). Alignment of different protein phosphatase 5 sequences was achieved using the Clustal W alignment program (Higgins et al., 1996) available in MacVector. BLAST program (Alschul et al., 1990) was used for homology searches. The deduced protein sequence was analyzed for hydropathy pro®le using the program of Hoffmann and Stoffel (Hoffmann and Stoffel, 1993). The PSORTII server program available on the web was used for the prediction of structural characteristics such as sub-cellular localization signals, different motif structures, molecular mass, etc. 2.5. Expression and puri®cation of Histidine-tag recombinant TbPP5 The ORF of the cDNA clone TbPP5 was ampli®ed using high ®delity Pfu polymerase and primers made according to the 5 H and 3 H sequences obtained from this clone and ¯anked at their 5 H ends by PstI and HindIII sites, respectively. The PCR product was then subcloned at the PstI/HindIII sites in vector pQE-31 (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). The recombinant protein was expressed after induction of a freshly grown culture of the bacteria with 1.0 mM IPTG for 4 h. After that period, cells were harvested and lysed by buffer A

(6 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.1 M NaH2PO4; 0.01 M Tris±Cl, pH 8.0; 1.0 mg/ml lysozyme, 10.0 mg/ml RNase; 5.0 mg/ml DNase; 1.0 mM PMSF; 10.0 mM imidazole; and 1.0% Triton X-100). The soluble His-6 tagged protein was puri®ed by Ni-NTA chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. For puri®cation of the recombinant protein (rTbPP5) under native conditions, cells were lysed in buffer B (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, 4 mM MnCl2, 1.0 mg/ml lysozyme, 10.0 mM imidazole; 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin). The rTbPP5 was eluted from the Ni-NTA (Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid) column using buffer C (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, 4 mM MnCl2, 250.0 mM imidazole; 0.1% Triton X-100; 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin) and was dialyzed in 50% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% 2mercaptoethanol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 4 mM MnCl2 overnight at 48C and then stored at 2208C. 2.6. Development of polyclonal antibodies Polyclonal antiserum against puri®ed His-6-rTbPP5 protein was developed in rabbits. First injections were given subcutaneously with complete Freund's adjuvant and subsequent boosters were done with Freund's incomplete adjuvant via the same route (Harlow and Lane, 1998). Two-hundred micrograms of puri®ed protein was used per injection per rabbit. Antisera were collected and tested for titer determination with puri®ed rTbPP5 protein. 2.7. Immunoblot analysis Mid-log phase cells (Bs and Pro trypanosomes) (1 £ 10 7) were harvested, proteins were analyzed in SDS-PAGE (10%) as described (Laemmli, 1970), and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 48C (32 V with 25 mM Tris± HCl and 192 mM glycine, 20% v/v methanol pH 8.3) (Towbin et al., 1979). Pro cells were also harvested at different growth phases and after 18 h serum starvation. Blots were developed with TbPP5 polyclonal antibodies as primary, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG, as a secondary antibody. Color was developed by AP-color development kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Speci®c protein bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning (Chemi Imagere, Alpha Inotec Corp. San Leandro, CA). 2.8. Indirect immuno¯uorescent microscopy Trypanosoma brucei procyclic trypanosomes were harvested, as described above. Cell suspensions (1±5 £ 10 6 cells/ml) in PBS were spread as a thin smear on the surface of a poly-l-lysine coated slide. Cells were ®xed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with cold methanol, as with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO) as secondary antibody for 1 h. DAPI (4 H ,6-

Diamidino-2-phenylindole) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was used to visualize the DNA (Sherwin and Read, 1993). Cells were viewed by a Zeiss Axiphoto microscope using the objective lens 40 £ /1.30 Plan-NEOFLUAR oil. The picture was taken with a low-light CCD camera for 3color ¯uorescence. The images were processed using Adobe PhotoShop Deluxe 5.1 and printed by Codonics NP-1600 thermal dye-sublimation printer. 2.9. Phosphatase assay rTbPP5 was assayed for para-nitrophenylphosphatase activity in a 50 ml reaction containing 0±400 mM pNPP, 2.8 mg of enzyme, and 0±300 mM arachidonic acid (AA) in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% 2mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% ethanol. Aliquots of enzyme were preincubated for 1 mm at 308C, and the reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of substrate and lipid prewarmed to 308C. Control reactions were assayed without enzyme to determine the spontaneous hydrolysis of pNPP at each substrate concentration. Assays were terminated after 15 mm with 450 ml of 0.25 N NaOH. Sample absorbance was measured at A410 to quantitate the release of paranitrophenolate, after subtracting the appropriate background (Skinner et al., 1997). 3. Results 3.1. Isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone for the Serine/threonine phosphatase 5 from Trypanosoma brucei During a homology search of the Trypanosome genome database (TIGR) for trypanosome mitochondrial outer membrane translocase proteins (TOM proteins), a sequence on cosmid clone 6N9 showed signi®cant identity with both Neurospora crassa and yeast TOM70 proteins. The matching region, which was about 90 amino acids long, included two N-terminal TPR motifs. Since TPR motifs are present in a variety of proteins with diverse cellular functions and locations, it was necessary to investigate the clone more completely before it could be de®nitively identi®ed. To characterize the cDNA clone corresponding to this genomic data base sequence, a PCR product (500 bp) was generated from T. brucei genomic DNA using primers designed from the data base sequence of the 6N9 cosmid clone. The PCR product was cloned and veri®ed by sequencing. Using this PCR product as a probe a T. brucei cDNA library was screened. Six positive clones were obtained from 5 £ 10 5 plaques screened. The complete sequence of one of the cDNA (TbPP5) clones revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1416 bp (Fig. 1) that encodes a protein of about 53 kDa. The actual ends of this cDNA clone were determined by 5 H and 3 H RACE (rapid ampli®cation of cDNA ends). The complete cDNA consist of a 54 bp 5 H UTR (un-translated region) and 1069 3 H UTR (Fig. 1). No difference in the 5 H and 3 H ends were

found between the Pro and Bs forms. Thus, the ®rst methioine of the predicted open reading frame is most probably the starting methionine (Fig. 1). The complete cDNA is about 2.5 kb. Comparison of the complete sequence against the fungal TOM70 proteins revealed no further signi®cant alignments. Thus, the original homology detected was entirely due to the TPR motifs. BLAST analysis (Alschul et al., 1990) of this deduced protein sequence showed strong similarity with type 5 serine/threonine protein phosphatases from different species. Similarity to other protein phosphatases, e.g. PP1, PP2A etc. was also detected. Using the ALIGN program (Mayers and Miller, 1998) the pairwise alignment of the deduced protein sequence of TbPP5 with PP5s from different species showed that the overall identity is within the range of 45±48% with a slightly greater identity of 49±53% in the C-terminal catalytic domain. The similarity of TbPP5 to other PP5s is shown in Fig. 2. The three invariant amino acid motifs i.e. -GDXHG-, GDXVXRG-, and -GNH- found in all PPP family members (Cohen, 1997) were found as exact matches in TbPP5 (underlined, in Fig. 2), except for the last motif, where H is replaced by Q in TbPP5. PP5 proteins characterized so far have 3±4 tandem TPR motifs at the N-terminus while the phosphatase catalytic domain exists in the C-terminus. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of TbPP5 revealed a similar structure (Fig. 2). The N-terminal region (7±107) contains three TPR repeats and the C-terminal residues (210±410) have the metallo-phosphoesterase motif. The TPR motifs showed more homology to their fungal counterparts than to the TPRs in mammalian PP5 proteins. However, like mammalian and Drosophila PP5s (Skinner et al., 1997; Ollendorff and Donoghue, 1997; Brown et al., 2000) the T. brucei protein contain three TPRs while the fungal PP5s possess four TPR motifs. 3.2. Gene copy number of TbPP5 and expression of the TbPP5 transcript Southern blot analysis of restriction digests of T brucei genomic DNA showed that the TbPP5 gene sequence exists as a single copy following high stringency washes of southern blots (Fig. 3A). The restriction enzymes that have a single site within the cDNA clearly showed two hybridizing bands. On the other-hand, non-cutter enzymes showed only a single band (Fig. 3A). Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from Bs and Pro forms showed the existence of a transcript of about 2.5 kb (Fig. 3B) that matches with the size of the complete cDNA. The transcript is present at about the same level in Pro and Bs forms (Fig. 3B). Re-probing of the same blot with tubulin DNA showed equal loading of RNA on the blot. It has been found that PP5 plays a prominent role in cellular proliferation in human carcinoma cells (Zuo et al., 1998). To determine, if TbPP5 has such role in T.

Fig. 3. Southern and northern blot analysis. (A) Southern blot analysis of T. brucei genomic DNA. Total DNA (10.0 mg) isolated from Pro forms was digested with different restriction enzymes either having no internal site, BamHI (B), NotI (N), PstI (F), XhoI (X), BstXI (Bx)) or having one internal site EcoRI (E), StuI (5), KpnI (K) within the TbPP5 cDNA sequence. The blot was probed with a PCR product encompassing the TbPP5 ORF. (B) Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from bloodstream (Bs) and procyclic (Pro) trypanosomes, electrophoresed on a 0.8% formaldehyde gel, blotted to Nytran membrane and probed with TbPP5 cDNA. The Lower panel represents the same blot reprobed with the coding sequence of T. brucei tubulin.

brucei growth, expression of the TbPP5 transcript was analyzed during the entire growth phase of the Pro forms. Interestingly, the TbPP5 transcript level was highest on days 3 and 4, the mid-log and late log phases of cell growth, and then gradually decreased in stationary phase (Fig. 4A,B). The same blot was re-probed with tubulin DNA (Fig. 4B). As expected, tubulin is present at the same level throughout the growth phase. These results suggest that TbPP5 may be associated with the active growth phase in T. brucei.

3.3. Steady-state level of the ThPP5 protein in the bloodstream and insect forms and intracellular location The open reading frame in TbPP5 was ampli®ed by PCR and cloned in a his6-tag expression vector, pQE31 as described in Section 2. The recombinant protein was included with 1.0 mM IPTG for 4 h. analysis of total protein of cells grown in the presence or absence with IPTG (Fig. 5A). The Histidine tag TbPP5 protein was puri®ed to homogeneity using a NiNTA af®nity column. More than 50% of

(A) Coomassie stained gel of the total cellular protein of E. coli grown for 4 h in the presence (In) and absence (Un) of 1.0 mM IPTG. (B) SDS-PAGE analysis of the His-tag rTbPP5 puri®ed by NiNTA af®nity chromatography. Protein was eluted from the column with 250 mM imidazole and the gel was stained with Coomassie. (C) Western blot analysis of the total cell protein of bloodstream (Bs) and procyclic (Pro) forms of T. brucei using polyclonal antibody developed against puri®ed recombinant protein. Protein molecular size markers are indicated in kiloDaltons (kDa).

rTbPP5 was solubilized in 6 M guanidine salt buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The solubilized protein bound ef®ciently to the NiNTA column and was eluted with imidazole (250 mM). A minor low molecular mass protein smear that was observed in the puri®ed preparation (Fig. 5B) was most probably the degradation product of the recombinant protein. The puri®ed protein was injected into rabbits to develop polyclonal antibodies against the protein. Anti-TbPP5 polyclonal antiserum was then used to detect proteins from total cell extracts of the T. brucei Pro and the Bs forms (Fig. 5C). Results showed that TbPP5 antibodies recognized a 52 kDa protein from total cell-extract of both forms. However, the steady-state level of the TbPP5 protein was about two fold higher in Pro than Bs forms (Fig. 5C). To determine the cellular localization of TbPP5, T. brucei Pro cells were ®xed and permeabilized with paraformaldehyde and cold methanol. Cells were stained with TbPP5 polyclonal antibody followed by FITC conjugated secondary antibody. Bright green color ¯uorescence was observed throughout the cell body indicating that TbPP5 is present in the cytosol (Fig. 6A). The position of the nucleus and the kinetoplast within the cell was seen by DAPI staining (Fig. 6B). Overlay of the two stains showed that TbPP5 is predominantly present in the cytosol and it is also present in some cell nucleus (Fig. 6D). Careful observation revealed that, within the cytoplasm TbPP5 localizes densely near the

nucleus (Fig. 6D). Insigni®cant ¯uorescence was observed when the cells were examined using pre-immune serum as the primary antibodies (not shown). Moreover, staining of unpermeabilized cells did not show any signi®cant peripheral ¯uorescence which suggest that TbPP5 is not present on the surface membrane (not shown). 3.4. The effect of serum starvation on the expression of TbPP5 in T. brucei It is possible that the reduction of nutrients or growth factors in the stationary phase of culture causes the down regulation of TbPP5 transcript level. To examine this possibility, T. brucei procyclic cells were incubated in serum free medium for 18 h, RNA was isolated and analyzed by northern blot analysis using TbPP5 and tubulin speci®c DNA. In addition, the TbPP5 protein level was also analyzed in the same experiment by immunobloting with the TbPP5 polyclonal antibody. The results showed that both the TbPP5 transcript and protein level were down regulated about 2±3-fold after 18 h of serum starvation (Fig. 7A,B). 3.5. Lipid activation of recombinant TbPP5 rTbPP5 was puri®ed under native conditions as described and phosphatase activity was assessed using pNPP as the substrate. The rTbPP5 was found to possess

phosphatase activity which followed the usual Michaelis± Menten kinetics for enzyme-substrate reactions, yielding a Km of 200 mM and a Vmax of 19.5 micro mole of Pi released per minute per mg of protein (Fig. 8A). One of the major characteristics of the protein phosphatase type 5 is the stimulation of catalytic activity by AA. The stimulation of PP5 activity by AA varied from 4±25-fold depending on the speci®c substrate and the enzyme sources (Sinclair et al., 1999; Chen and Cohen, 1997). AA was

found to stimulate the rTbPP5 activity in a concentration dependent manner with maximum activation of TbPP5 about 2.6-fold. At lower substrate concentration, e.g. 150 mM pNPP, which is about half saturated concentration, maximum stimulation of the phosphatase activity occurs at an AA concentration of about 75 mM (Fig. 8B). At saturated substrate concentration (400 mM pNPP) the phosphate activity increases gradually and reached a plateau near 200 mM AA (Fig. 8C).

Mid-log phase cells were harvested and re-incubated in fresh BSM medium with (1) and without (2) the addition of fetal bovine serum (10%). After 18 h of growth, the steady state level of TbPP5 transcript and protein were analyzed by northern (A) and western blot (B) analysis. For northern analysis the same blot was ®rst probed with TbPP5 cDNA and then re-probed with tubulin DNA as the control. Ethidium bromide stained rRNA bands are shown as a control for equal loading. Polyclonal antibody developed against recombinant TbPP5 was used as the probe for the immunoblot.

4. Discussion Type5 protein phosphatase is a relatively new member of the PPP family. PP5 has been cloned and characterized from different mammalian systems, plants, Drosophila, and fungi. This report describes the ®rst characterization of this type of protein phosphatase from one of the most ancient eukaryotes, the parasitic protozoan, T. brucei. Two other types of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, PP1A & B and PP2 of the PPP family have been previously cloned from T. brucei (Erondu and Donelson, 1991; Evers and Cornelissen, 1990). The invariant structural motifs of the catalytic domain, (-GDXHG-, -GDXVXRG-, and GNH) found in all PPP proteins examined thus far, are present in those T. brucei proteins as well as TbPP5 described here. This suggests that the structure of the catalytic domain of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase of the PPP family is conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom from protist to mammals. During their digenetic life cycle, T. brucei undergoes various stages of differentiation to adapt to dramatically different environments in two host systems (Vickerman, 1985). Although it is envisioned that signal transduction pathways are involved in those differentiation process, only a handful of proteins, involved in this process have been characterized in this class of parasite. Understanding the signaling pathways in trypanosomatids requires characterization of other components of these pathways, identi®cation of the interacting proteins and elucidation of their function in cellular differentiation and proliferation. Moreover, many signalling pathways in other organisms culmi-

nate in the activation of transcription factors (Pelech and Sanghera, 1992); such factors have also not been identi®ed in trypanosomatids (Clayton, 1992). Because the major mechanisms for gene regulation in these parasites appear to be post-transcriptional (Clayton, 1992), it has been suggested that signalling pathways may be comparatively stream-lined and regulate gene expression by targeting molecules involved in RNA processing or turnover (Parsons and Ruben, 2000). The speci®city and function of different members of the PPP family are determined by interactions of their related catalytic cores with a regulatory subunit or speci®c regulatory domains in the protein. All PP5 proteins possess an Nterminal TPR domain which plays important roles in regulation of its enzymatic activity. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as AA, bind with the TPR domain of PP5 proteins and activate the enzyme about 4±25-fold (Sinclair et al., 1999; Chen and Cohen, 1997). Proteolytic processing of the TPR domain and ten amino acid residues from the C-terminal also shows a similar affect, suggesting that lipid binding cause allosteric modi®cation of the protein structure, which might expose the catalytic domain and increase the enzymatic activity. It is evident that the TPR domains of PP5 also interact with other proteins such as, hsp90 of the glucocorticoid receptor complex (Silverstein et al., 1997), the kinase domain of the atrial natriuretic peptide/guanylate receptor complex (Chinkers, 1994), and several cell cycle regulating proteins (e.g. cdcl6 and cdc27) containing TPR domain structures (Ollendorff and Donoghue, 1997). Thus, the TPR domain also determines the speci®city of the enzyme reaction by binding with a speci®c protein. It

Phosphatase activity was assayed for 30 mm at 308C with 2.8 mg of recombinant enzyme, 0±400 mM pNPP, and 0±300 mM AA in a 50 ml reaction volume as described in Section 2. Results shown are the average micromole of Pi released per mm per mg of enzyme 1 SE from a representative assay performed in triplicate.

seems likely, that the TPR domain in TbPP5 may regulate the function of the enzyme in T. brucei. Thus, identi®cation of the T. brucei proteins that interact with this domain will be helpful in understanding the speci®c function of this protein and its role in any signal transduction pathway. This might be achieved by co-immunoprecipation studies or with the use of the yeast two hybrid system. Recombinant TbPP5 showed phosphatase activity and the enzymatic activity was stimulated 2.6 fold by 75 mM AA at half-saturation concentration of the substrate pNPP. Activation of the rTbPP5 catalytic activity at higher substrate concentration requires more lipid. It is most probably that the higher concentration of substrate inhibits the interaction of TbPP5 with AA. A similar phenomenon has been observed with PP5 puri®ed from bovine brain (Skinner et al., 1997). In T. brucei, TbPP5 is expressed as a 52 kDa protein in the two major proliferative forms of the cell, Bs and Pro.

The protein is expressed at a slightly higher level in the Pro than the Bs form. In-situ immunostaining showed that the TbPP5 protein is localized in the cytosol in this parasite. Double immuno-¯uoresence labeling of cells with DAPI and FITC-conjugated antibody revealed that antibody predominantly stained the cytosol but in some population of cells it is present in the nucleus. No signi®cant staining of the mitochondrion was observed. Staining of un-permeabilized cells did not show any peripheral staining. Moreover, immunoblot analysis of the soluble and membrane fraction (not shown) revealed that TbPP5 possibly not present on the cell surface. In other system PP5 proteins have been localized in the nucleus and in cytoplasm (Ollendorff and Donoghue, 1997; Chen et al., 1994). During mitosis, in mammalian cells this protein primarily localized in the nucleus (Ollendorff and Donoghue, 1997; Chen et al., 1994). However, after nuclear membrane breakdown, PP5 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm

(Chen et al., 1994). In Drosophila, PP5 is seen predominantly at the periphery of the embryo and located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the newly formed cells (Brown et al., 2000). Since it is known in mammalian system that the protein must interact with its binding partner, glucocorticoid receptor and ANP/guanylate receptor, outside the nucleus (Silverstein et al., 1997; Chinkers, 1994), at least a fraction of the protein must be present in the cytosol. The data presented here showed that TbPP5 is predominantly cytosolic but also present in the parasite nucleus. Moreover, the presence of a conserved region at the carboxy terminus (amino acids 455±466 of TbPP5) that in other system appears to be essential for nuclear localization of PP5, suggest that probably in T. brucei, this region plays similar role for targeting TbPP5 to the nucleus. Further analysis of synchronized T. brucei cells is needed to reveal the distribution of the protein throughout the cell cycle. T. brucei TbPP5 appeared expressed at higher levels in mid-log phase than in stationary phase cells. In stationary phase, depletion of speci®c nutrients and growth factor(s) may cause a reduction in signal via some receptor complex that results in down-regulation of PP5 expression. This notion is supported by the observation that both the TbPP5 protein and transcript are down-regulated about 2± 3-fold after 18 h serum starvation of Pro cells. In the mammalian system, PP5 is known to be involved in cell proliferation. Inhibition of PP5 expression causes hyperphosphorylation of p53, the tumor suppressor protein, resulting in induction of the inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases, e.g. p21 wAF1/ciPI leading to growth arrest in G1 phase (Zuo et al., 1998). The life-cycle of African trypanosomes alternates between proliferative and quiescent stages (Vickerman, 1985). It will be interesting to determine if TbPP5 plays any role in this type of cell proliferation and growth arrest stages in T. brucei. Further analysis of the structure and function of the TbPP5 protein and identi®cation of its speci®c substrate(s) and possible interacting proteins may be helpful in understanding signal transduction pathways in trypanosomes. Such studies may also elucidate the mechanism of cellular proliferation of this parasite and possibly suggest mechanisms to control the disease.
