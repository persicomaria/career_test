We report that Pro74 in human stefin B is critical for fibril formation and that proline isomerization plays an important role. The stefin B P74S mutant did not fibrillate over the time of observation at 25 °C, and it exhibited a prolonged lag phase at 30 °C and 37 °C. The peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase cyclophilin A, when added to the wild-type protein, exerted two effects: it prolonged the lag phase and increased the yield and length of the fibrils. Addition of the inactive cyclophilin A R55A variant still resulted in a prolonged lag phase but did not mediate the increase of the final fibril yield. These results demonstrate that peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerism is rate-limiting in stefin B fibril formation. Ó 2009 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Amyloid fibril formation is at the focus of protein structure and folding studies for two reasons: it contributes to some general, open questions of basic protein science and is highly relevant to an understanding of the molecular events leading to neurodegenerative diseases [1­3]. As the property of proteins to undergo amyloid fibril formation is a generic one [4,5], any protein, but especially those with a high propensity to undergo fibrillation and for which there exist abundant folding and structural data, would be appropriate for use as a model system. Human stefin B has been used as a suitable model protein to study protein folding, amyloid fibril formation and amyloid-induced toxicity. In contrast to its homologue stefin A, stefin B was found to undergo amyloid fibril formation under relatively mild conditions [3,6,7], with the

morphology of mature fibrils being dependent on solvent conditions [8]. As in some other amyloidogenic proteins, the cytotoxicity of the prefibrillar state correlated to lipid binding, especially to the acidic phospholipids [9]. Recently, a mutant of stefin B, which adopts an oligomeric molten globule, was shown to exhibit toxicity similar to that of the prefibrillar oligomers [10]. Cystatins, among them human stefin B, are well characterized structurally in their monomeric states [11­13]. However, this family of proteins readily undergoes domain-swapping. It has been shown that cystatin C dimers are domain-swapped [14]. The NMR structure of human stefin A (cystatin A) and chicken cystatin dimers [15] have confirmed domain-swapping [16], whereas the crystal structure of stefin B tetramer [17] has revealed an important role of the cis conformation of the prolyl bond at P74 in the process of exchanging loops between the two domain-swapped dimers. A recent study of H/D exchange followed by NMR [18] showed that in stefin B fibrils, b-strands 2 and 3 are shared with domain-swapped dimers. A similar mechanism of trans to cis proline isomerization, which plays a role in the tetramer formation, was suggested to be involved in fibril formation. Proline residues play a prominent role in folding, dynamics and function of proteins [19­22]. They were found to be involved in

domain-swapping [23] and in protein aggregation to amyloid fibrils [24­26]. In the process of amyloid fibril formation they are important, both, in the nucleation and in fibril elongation [26,27]. The cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding proline is considered to form an intrinsic molecular switch controlling several physiologically relevant processes, such as opening of the pore of a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel [28,29]. Peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) are enzymes that catalyze the cis/ trans isomerization of prolyl bonds. Interestingly, the PPIase Pin1, was shown to regulate amyloid-beta precursor protein processing [30] and accumulation of a-synuclein aggregates into inclusions [31]. In this work we have shown that substituting proline at position 74 with a serine in the sequence of the wild-type stefin B (with E at site 31) does not affect protein's structure and stability to any significant extent. The mutant P74S(E31) or, simply P74S, was therefore used to compare the fibrillation rate with that of the wild-type protein [32]. We have shown that P74 is crucial, not only for stefin B tetramer formation [17], but also for amyloid fibrillation of this protein. Without proline at position 74, fibrils are formed much slower and to a lesser extent. Additionally, the effect of the PPIase cyclophilin A (CypA) on the fibril formation of wild-type stefin B, with P74 in place, has been studied. The presence of CypA caused two effects: (i) a prolongation of the lag phase and (ii) an increase in the yield and length of the fibrils. In contrast to other proteins used as controls CypA effects were more pronounced at substoichiometric concentrations, suggesting PPIase activity to play a role in affecting fibril formation. To further analyze the role of PPIase activity, the CypA R55A variant which exhibits strongly reduced PPIase activity, was studied.

2.3. PPIase activity measurements The PPIase activity of CypA was measured using the oligopeptide substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA in the protease free assay system according to Janowski et al. [36] at 10 °C. 2.4. Size-exclusion chromatography Size-exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature, 23­25 °C. One hundred microliters samples of the wildtype stefin B and its P74S mutant were applied to Superdex 75 HR column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). The column was equilibrated with 15 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl. 2.5. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy CD spectra were measured using an Aviv model 62A DS CD spectropolarimeter. Far-UV and near-UV CD spectra were recorded, at 23 °C, in 0.1 cm and 1 cm cells. All measurements were carried out in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 100 mM NaCl. Protein concentrations were 0.3 mg/mL for the farUV CD and 1.0 mg/mL for the near-UV CD spectra measurements. Protein solutions in various concentrations of urea were prepared at least 16 h before measurements. An 1 mm light path quvette was used. Ellipticity values at 252 nm and 222 nm were obtained by averaging the signal for 30 s at each wavelength. For thermal scans an 1-mm rectangular cell was used. Scanning was performed with a step of 2 °C from 45 °C to 95 °C for the wildtype stefin B and from 25 °C to 95 °C for the mutant P74S, at a rate of 2 °C per 10 s. The bandwidth was set at 1 nm. Recordings were done at two wavelengths simultaneously: 222 nm and 210 nm. Protein concentrations in both denaturations experiments were 47 lM. The Gibbs free energies of unfolding, cm and m values were calculated according to Santoro and Bollen [37]. To derived thermodynamic parameters from thermal denaturation, equations as in [38] were used. 2.6. Measurement of fibril growth Thioflavin T (ThT) dye was used to determine the presence of amyloid-like fibrils. Fluorescence was measured using a Perkin­Elmer model LS 50 B luminescence spectrometer. ThT fluorescence was excited at 440 nm and emission spectra were recorded from 455 nm to 600 nm. All details were described previously [6,7]. Concentrations of CypA were 17 lM and 3.4 lM in solution with 34 lM wild-type stefin B. Amyloid fibrillation of the Y31 isoform of stefin B, i.e., the S3Y31 variant [17] was also studied alone and in presence of CypA. 17 lM of CypA was added to stefin B at 34 lM protein concentration. Concentrations of stefin A were 34 lM and 3.4 lM in solution with 34 lM wild-type stefin B. Concentration of carbonic anhydrase B alone was 34 lM and with wild-type stefin B was the same. The curves when appearing sigmoidal were simulated by the software program Origin 6.1. For the other curves, where the plateau turned downwards, a smooth line was drawn between the experimental points. 2.7. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Samples were prepared as described [6]. They were observed with a Philips CM 100 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Images were recorded by Bioscan CCD camera Gatan, using Digital Micrograph software. Two parallel grids were pre-

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials The PPIase CypA was from Sigma. An additional sample of recombinant CypA wild-type and CypA R55A variant (in which arginine at position 55 ­ located in the active site ­ is substituted by alanine) proteins were produced as described [33]. Briefly, the proteins were over-expressed in the Escherichia coli M15 strain and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 20 mM tricine buffer (pH 8.0), and lysates were purified by an anion exchange column (Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(M)). The flow through was collected and applied to an affinity column (Fractogel TSK AF-Blue). CypA was eluted by a gradient of 0­3 M KCl in 20 mM tricine buffer (pH 8.0). Eluted fractions were collected and dialyzed twice against 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). CypA was further purified by a Fractogel SO3 exchange column, and the protein was eluted with a 0­1 M gradient of NaCl. Collected fractions were examined for purity by SDS­PAGE. Lysozyme was from Serva, carbonic anhydrase B was from Sigma. Stefin A was prepared and purified in our laboratory by the usual procedures used for stefins [32,34]. 2.2. Preparation of wild-type like stefin B and its site-specific mutant P74S Wild-type human stefin B (C3E31 by sequence) was used as the starting point. First, the cysteine residue C3 was substituted with serine by site-directed mutagenesis. This S3E31 variant, which we also term `wild-type stefin B', does not form covalent disulfide bonds. Proline 74 was then substituted with serine to give P74S(E31). Both proteins, i.e., the wild-type and its P74S mutant, were prepared as described [32,34,35].

that the initial protein is wild-type, bearing E31, we have marked the mutant as P74S(E31), strictly so in the figures. The CD spectra in the near-UV clearly show that this mutation does not change the tertiary structure (i.e., the rigid environment of aromatics) of the protein (Fig. 1B). Small differences in the far-UV CD (Fig. 1A) are most likely due to different distribution of the oligomers in the sample (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). As a distinction, the P74S(Y31) mutant on the background of stefin B Y31 polymorph was previously shown to adopt a molten globule [17,10]. The stability of the wild-type stefin B and its P74S mutant were determined by urea and thermal denaturations (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). The Gibbs free energies of unfolding, cm and m values were calculated from the urea denaturation data, according to Santoro and Bollen (Table 1). It can be seen that the P74S mutant is slightly more stable than the wild-type by 9.2 kJ/mol. The denaturation curve of stefin B P74S(E31) had a midpoint at 5.3 M urea, that of wild-type stefin at 4.9 M urea. Higher stability of the P74S mutant is also supported by the thermal denaturation data. Thermal denaturation curves were recorded at 222 and 210 nm, from which thermodynamic parame-

Urea denaturation for the wild-type human stefin B and its site-specific mutant P74S. The denaturation curves (Supplementary Fig. 3) have been analyzed by using two-state approximation [37]. DG N--U is the free energy of unfolding, cm is the concentration of denaturant at which half of the molecules are unfolded, and m is cooperativity that represents the difference in the surface of protein exposed to the solvent in the folded and unfolded states. The values are the average of three independent measurements.

ters of unfolding were calculated (Table 2). As derived from thermal denaturation curves recorded at 210 nm, P74S and wild-type stefin B exhibited transition temperatures of 79.5 ± 0.15 °C and 76.6 ± 0.2 °C, respectively under the chosen buffer conditions at pH 7.0. 3.2. Fibrillation kinetics Fig. 2A and B shows amyloid fibrillation reactions (pH 4.8, 12% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)) for the P74S mutant and the wild-type stefin B obtained at 25 °C and 30 °C. They differ in the lag phase and in the rate of fibril growth. At 25 °C (Fig 2A), the wild-type stefin B exhibits a lag phase of around 50 h, whereas, under the same conditions, the P74S mutant does not start to form fibrils until 500 h. When the temperature is raised to 30 °C (Fig. 2B), the lag phase of the wild-type shortens to <25 h and the P74S fibrils start to grow after a lag phase of about 100 h. An even shorter lag phase for P74S was observed at 37 °C, where the wild-type protein no longer shows a lag phase (not shown). It can be concluded that the change of P74 to serine in P74S(E31) slows down the fibrillation reaction but does not prevent it. In contrast, it has been shown before that P74S(Y31), which is molten globular, does not form fibrils at all, but rather, amorphous aggregates [17]. However, both E31 and Y31 wild-type variants, which contain a proline at position 74, readily fibrillate.

To examine, if the influence of proline at position 74 on stefin B fibrillation is related to the cis/trans isomerization of its preceding bond, we used the PPIase cyclophilin A (CypA). We added it to the usual fibrillation mixture which contained only 10% TFE to prolong the lag phase. As can be seen from Fig. 3A, addition of CypA makes a distinction in the length of the lag phase and the amount of mature fibrils formed. The effect is substantial at 0.5:1 and 0.1:1 molar ratios of CypA to stefin B. CypA in both molar ratios, but especially so in the lower one, delayed the fibril growth and increased the yield of the mature fibrils (Fig. 3A). A control experiment has shown that CypA alone under chosen buffer conditions and at the lower concentration does not aggregate substantially or fibrillate (not shown). As additional comparisons, the fibrillation reactions of the protein mixtures of stefin A, lysozyme and carbonic anhydrase B (CAB) in 1:1 molar ratios to stefin B, were measured (Fig. 3B­D). No major influence of lysozyme was detected (Fig. 3C), either on the lag phase or on the rate of fibril growth of stefin B. CAB itself underwent aggregation immediately (as judged by ThT fluorescence and TEM, see below) and slightly delayed stefin B fibril growth (Fig. 3D). Stefin A also delayed stefin B fibril growth (Fig. 3B). This can be explained by specific interaction between stefin B and stefin A, which may prevent fibril growth. To compare the effect of stefin A to that of CypA, which also delayed stefin B fibrillation, lower concentration of stefin A was added to stefin B in 0.1:1 molar ratio.

In such a case it delayed stefin B fibrillation to a much smaller extent (Fig. 3B), contrasting the effect of CypA (Fig. 3A). In order to analyze, if the enzymatic activity of CypA is responsible for the delay of fibril growth or increase in yield, we added the CypA R55A variant which exhibits strongly reduced PPIase activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, CypA R55A also delayed the lag phase but did not raise the yield of fibrils suggesting an involvement of PPIase activity in the enhancement of the fibril yield. To confirm the results obtained by ThT fluorescence, TEM images were recorded (Fig. 4A­E) at chosen time points in the fibril growth reactions of the wild-type stefin B and its P74S mutant (marked by arrows in Fig. 2A). It can be seen that P74S remained in the form of a granular aggregate (Fig. 4B), while the wild-type protein formed amyloid fibrils after incubation for 7 days (Fig. 4A). From the plateau of the fibril growth reactions of stefin

B in the presence of CypA (marked by an arrow in Fig. 3A) and stefin A (marked by an arrow in Fig. 3D), both at 10 times lower concentration to stefin B, a sample was taken to record TEM as shown in Fig. 4C and D. The fibrils formed with (Fig. 4C) or without CypA (Fig. 4A) were of the same shape and morphology ­ as one would expect. However, closer examination has shown that the reaction in the presence of CypA produced a higher yield of stefin B fibrils; as would be judged by ThT fluorescence but also higher density and length of the fibrils as observed by TEM. Fig. 4C is a representative image, however, to make the conclusion about the density and length of the fibrils many micrographs were examined for each of the two parallel grids prepared from each sample. In contrast, stefin A, at comparable low concentration to CypA and ten times lower than stefin B, was inhibitory to stefin B fibril growth ­ as judged by ThT fluorescence, while TEM has shown that the final

yield and length of individual fibrils were lower (Fig. 4D ­ a representative image). In Fig. 4E stefin B fibrils in presence of CAB granular aggregates can be seen.

4. Discussion The following questions, important to amyloid field, have been addressed in this study: what role do prolines play as switches in amyloid fibril formation and what is the effect of enzymatic acceleration of prolyl cis/trans isomerization on protein fibrillation and/ or aggregation? As to the role of structurally important prolines, our comparison of the stability and fibrillation kinetics of the P74S mutant and the wild-type stefin B shows that the substitution of proline at position 74 by serine leads to a much lower propensity to fibrillate (Figs. 2 and 4). From the CD spectra (Fig. 1) it can be seen that the P74S mutant is folded like the wild-type protein, suggesting that differences in the overall fold are not the reason for the delay in fibril formation. Indeed, the mutant is slightly more stable (Tables 1 and 2), which also could contribute to lower propensity to fibrillate. We have observed before that the lag phase could be prolonged (four times at 25 °C) due to a single site mutation of a charged residue, such as G4R [32]. We also have studied P36G and P79S mutants of the Y31 isoform of stefin B [34] and observed that lower stability of P36G led to the amorphous aggregation, whereas the P79S showed a somewhat prolonged lag phase. In the structure of stefin B tetramer [17] the conformational switch involving the S72-L80 loop leads to exposure of H75 when P74 trans to cis isomerization occurs. Proline at position 79 might play a role in this loop movement, because P79S is predominantly tetrameric while the parent stefin B, the Y31 variant, is mostly dimeric. Probably, P74 cis to trans (or the reverse) isomerisation is needed for the transition to fibrils in the wild-type protein, which might help to ridify the loop movement and thus, the P74S mutant in which this effect is absent, exhibits the significantly prolonged lag phase (more than 10 times at 25 °C). Since proline isomerization is known to play a critical role in protein folding and rearrangement [19­22], we wanted to analyze, if similar conformational interconversion is involved in fibril formation. It is well known that slow folding reactions caused by prolyl bond isomerization can be accelerated by the PPIase CypA, which belongs to an important class of folding helper enzymes in the cells [19]. Less is known of CypA action on amyloid fibrillation reactions. We show that in the case of wild-type stefin B, addition of CypA actually delays the fibril growth. It does, however, increase the final yield and length of the mature fibrils (Fig. 3A). Some other proteins studied (Fig. 3B­D) also influenced stefin B fibril growth. Lysozyme at a 1:1 ratio had a small effect, much smaller than stefin A at the same 1:1 ratio (Fig. 3C vs. B). Stefin A and lysozyme both inhibited the final yield of stefin B fibrils, which is opposite to the CypA effect. Stefin A, which is a close structural homologue of stefin B having 52% amino acid residues identity, was more efficient in inhibiting stefin B fibril growth at 1:1 molar ratio than at ten times lower concentration (Fig. 3B). This can be explained as if stefin A would block specifically additions of amyloidogenic bricks (domain-swapped dimers) of its homologous protein ­ stefin B. However, at the low molar ratio 0.1­1 to stefin B, the effect of stefin A was much lower (Fig. 3B) while CypA at the same low molar ratio (Fig. 3A) led to 2.5 times longer lag phase. It thus remains outstanding that CypA, especially in the substoichiometric (0.1­1) CypA to stefin B molar ratio, delays the progress of wild-type stefin B to mature fibrils and at the same time increases the final yield. Notably, stefin B fibrils in presence of the 10 times lower concen-

trations of CypA (Fig. 4C) or stefin A (Fig. 4D) are prolonged and shortened, respectively. That CypA acts more efficiently at the substoichiometrical molar ratio may suggest its action as a catalyst. Thus, CypA obviously promotes correct fibril formation, presumably by its action as folding helper enzyme, while stefin A binds directly to stefin B protofibrils and inhibits their prolongation. To further analyze the role of the enzymatic activity of CypA in influencing fibril formation which will result in an increase in the rate of cis/trans isomerization of prolyl bonds, the enzymatically inactive CypA R55A variant was used in the same low molar ratio (0.1­1). Similar to wild-type CypA, this variant prolonged the lag phase, however, it did not increase the final yield of the fibrils (Fig. 3A). This indicates that the PPIase activity of CypA is necessary for the increase of the final fibril yield, whereas the CypA induced prolongation of the lag phase may result from CypA­stefin B protein­ protein interactions. These, albeit weak are a hallmark of molecular chaperones [39]. Thus, producing longer and more dense amyloidlike fibrils of stefin B, is probably mediated by the catalytical enhancement of the prolyl cis/trans isomerization rate by CypA. To dissolve any doubt that CypA is active in the aggregation assay its enzymatic effect towards an oligopeptide substrate [36] was analyzed under similar conditions. In 0.015 M acetate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 4.8, 10% TFE, CypA exhibited PPIase activity towards Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA with an kcat/Km value of 2.3 Â 105 MÀ1 sÀ1. This value reflects an about 50-fold decrease of the PPIase activity of CypA compared to its activity under standard conditions (35 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.8), however, there is still a considerable PPIase activity left. Interestingly, it has been reported recently that FKBP12, which belongs to another family of peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases, exerts chaperone-like activity and prevents insulin from amorphous aggregation [40]. The authors of that work did not inspect if the fibrillation itself was delayed or accelerated or affected in some other way.
