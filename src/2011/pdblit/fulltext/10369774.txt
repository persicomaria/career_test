Abstract We have cloned and functionally characterized a portion of the human hnRNP I (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein type I) gene containing the promoter elements. HnRNP I is an alternative splicing modulator of tissue-specific transcripts that is expressed in three different isoforms. The DNA sequence at the transcription start site, identified by 5P-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, shows a high `GC' content, lacks canonical TATA sequences and contains multiple putative Sp1 and NF1 transcription factor-binding sites, a GATA box and a CAAT box. By means of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct and deletion analyses, we have identified two regions between 3770 bp and 3206 bp that had a positive effect on expression activity in HeLa cells. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

HnRNP I, also known as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) [1^3], is a member of a family of RNA-binding proteins known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) [4^6]. HnRNP I mediates exon skipping for a growing number of mammalian genes, including Q3aminobutyric acid A (GABAA ) Q2 receptor, c-src, Kand L-tropomyosin [7^15]. Expression of hnRNP I is tissue and developmentally regulated resulting higher in fetal and proliferating cells compared to adult and resting cells [16]. The protein exists in three di¡erent isoforms that are the result of alternative splicing of the hnRNP I gene localized on chromosome 19 [17,18]. A switch in the ratio of the two major hnRNP I isoforms has been observed in two related prostate cancer cell lines [19] and overexpression of both forms has been shown in glioblastoma multiform tumors correlated to K-exon exclusion in human ¢broblast growth factor receptor-1 transcripts [20]. Since the regulatory regions of hnRNP I expression were not known we have analyzed the 5P-region of the hnRNP I gene.

The longest cDNA of the hnRNP I gene previously isolated starts at position 87 upstream from the ¢rst ATG [3]. To determine whether the cDNA extends further upstream and also to map the transcription start site of the hnRNP I gene, 5P-RACE (rapid ampli¢cation of cDNA ends) was applied to RNA isolated from human ¢broblasts or HeLa cells. The 5P-RACE procedure [21] was basically according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). Brie£y, an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 270^245 downstream from the ATG (5P-CATCAGGAGGTTGGTGACCTTCCCA-3P) was used as a primer to synthesize ¢rst strand cDNA from 5 Wg poly(A) RNA. The ¢rst strand cDNA was puri¢ed from unincorporated nucleotides and primers by the highly pure PCR product puri¢cation system (Roche). Following anchor ligation of the cDNA, an internal gene-speci¢c primer (5P-TGACTTCCCCCTCCGTGACGTCGAT-3P), complementary to nucleotides 226^201 downstream from the ATG, was used with an anchor primer to amplify the hnRNP I transcripts. Cycling conditions used were: 94³C for 1 min, 58³C for 1 min, and 72³C for 2 min, for 35 cycles. The PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced using an automated laser £uorescent DNA sequencer (Pharmacia-Biotech). The 5PRACE assays provided extended products that indicated

two transcriptional start sites lying 87 bp and 40 bp upstream from the translational ATG. Results from primer extension and RT-PCR analysis were in concordance with the RACE-PCR data (data not shown). The major transcription start site located at 87 bp upstream from the ¢rst ATG was de¢ned as position +1 (Fig. 1). To characterize the 5P-£anking region of the hnRNP I gene, a fragment lying immediately upstream from the translation start codon was cloned by nested PCR from human genomic DNA. To this purpose we used the sequence information of a cosmid derived from chromosome 19, deposited by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This sequence (accession No. AC6273) contains a region that has 100% identity to the hnRNP I coding sequence, organized in 15 exons [18]. First PCR was per-

formed with forward primer 5P-AAGTCCAGGCCTCAGTTTCC-3P and the reverse primer 5P- ATGGCACACAGAGCAGACC-3P, complementary to the sequence at positions 31089 to 31069 and +89 to +70 respectively, relative to the major transcription start site. We used the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95³C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 95³C for 30 s, 56³C (¢rst ¢ve cycles) and 62³C (the remaining 30 cycles) for 1 min, 72³C for 1 min, and ¢nal extension at 72³C for 5 min. Nested PCR was then performed with forward primer 5P-AGCTGTAGGCGGGCGGCCAA-3P (F2) and the reverse primer 5P-GGCACACAGAGCAGACCCGC-3P (R2) at positions indicated in Fig. 1; the cycling condition were: initial denaturation at 95³C for 5 min, 25 cycles at 94³C for 30 s, 60³C for 30 s, 72³C for 45 s, and ¢nal extension at 72³C

Numbers indicate 5P- and 3P-ends relative to the major transcription initiation site for each construct. Deletion constructs were cloned into the promoterless pBLCAT3 vector. (B) Results of CAT expression assays in HeLa cells after transient transfection using the constructs described in A. HeLa cells were co-transfected with these constructs and with a pRSV-LUC plasmid. After 24 h cell extracts were assayed for CAT and luciferase activity. Promoter activities are expressed as percentage relative to the activity of the hnRNP I promoter construct 3770/+87, whose activity was assigned as 100%. Each construct was transfected four times and assayed in duplicate. CAT activities were normalized to luciferase activities. Values are shown as mean þ S.E.M. (n = 4).

the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), an initiator sequence-binding protein [23], was identi¢ed at positions 311 to +9. The presence of these multiple transcription factor-binding sites in the 5P-£anking sequence strongly suggested that the fragment indeed contains the functional promoter. To examine the region of the 5P-£anking sequence essential for transcription, various 5P-deletion mutants were constructed. The ability for each construct to promote the transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene was tested in HeLa cells. A fragment spanning the region at 3869 to +87, including both transcription start sites, was cloned into the promoterless plasmid pBLCAT3 [24], then hnRNP I promoter/CAT chimeric constructs with di¡erent deletions of the 5P-region promoter were generated by PCR using nested sense primers (Fig. 2). HeLa cells (4U106 ) were co-transfected with one of the CAT constructs together with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene coding region fused to a respiratory syncytial virus promoter (p-RSV-LUC) by electroporation in DMEM 10% fetal calf serum at 250 V and 500 WF. After 24 h of incubation at 37³C, the cells were collected and analyzed for either CAT or luciferase reporter activity according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega). CAT activities were normalized to luciferase activities expressed by pRSV-LUC co-transfected plasmid. We represented the results as percentage of CAT

for 5 min. A fragment of approx. 1 kb was ampli¢ed and ligated to pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence of the isolated fragment was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using an A.L.F. automated laser £uorescent DNA sequencer (Pharmacia-Biotech) and compared with the human genomic sequence deposited, using the computer software BLAST from NCBI. The sequence of the cloned fragment matched with 100% similarity the genomic region upstream from the hnRNP I ¢rst exon. Computational analysis of the 963 bp region lying immediately upstream from the transcription start site, using TFSEARCH and TRANSFAC programs, could not identify a classical TATA box, whereas several other putative binding sites for transcription factors were identi¢ed (Fig. 1). GC boxes were located at 3906 to 3893, 3802 to 3790, 3754 to 3742, 3375 to 3363, and 3106 to 393. GC boxes, which are binding sequences of Sp1, are in many cases responsible for the transcription of genes having TATA-less promoters [22]. A typical upstream promoter element such as a CAAT boxlike sequence was located at positions 353 to 341 and several other potential regulatory elements were identi¢ed: multiple NF1 sites lie between 3591 and 390, a GATA box site at 3500 to 3491, an N-Myc site at 3240 to 3229, two NF-UB-like sites at 3526 to 3517 and at 380 to 371. The sequence motif CCAT for binding of

activity relative to the construct that showed the higher activity; in all the assays we introduced the promoterless pBLCAT3 as a negative control. The constructs 3869/+87 and 3770/+87 showed the highest CAT activity (Fig. 2); deletion of the fragment up to 3428 resulted in a 30% reduction of CAT activity relative to the whole construct. Additional deletion of about 200 bp up to 3206 further reduced the CAT activity that resulted of approx. 20% relative to the 3770/+87. These results indicated that the region within 3770 to 3206 contains cis-acting promoter elements that can positively regulate the expression activity. The binding sites found within this region include a putative GATA box and transcription factors Sp1 and NF1. To further analyze the regulatory sequences, we made 5P- and 3P-deletion constructs derived from 3770/ +87 fragment (Fig. 3). We observed that CAT activities of 3770/+87 and 3770/+8 constructs were similar, whereas 3770/+28 showed about 60% decrease of the activity. Interestingly all the deletions introduced at the 5P-end in the construct 3770/+8 showed expression levels similar to the promoterless construct pBLCAT3. These results suggest that positive regulatory elements localize between 3770 and 3442, whereas a di¡erent length of the transcribed untranslated region can contribute with a negative e¡ect on the expression activity, thus suggesting, together with a possible mRNA instability, a possible role of the mRNA molecular conformation in the translational step. In summary, this study has identi¢ed the hnRNP I promoter regions that contain cis-acting elements required for the expression of the hnRNP I gene. In particular the results of CAT analysis indicate the presence of putative positive regulatory elements between 3770 and 3442 and between 3442 and 3206. Identi¢cation and molecular characterization of the nuclear factors that interact with the promoter region identi¢ed in this study may reveal how the expression of this gene is regulated in proliferating cells.
