The high-resolution structures of the wild-type periplasmic domain of the bacterial aspartate receptor have been determined in the absence and presence of bound aspartate to 1.85 and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. As we reported earlier, in the refined structure of the complexed form of the crosslinked cysteine mutant receptor, the binding of the aspartate at the first site was mediated through four bridging water molecules while the second site showed an occupant electron density that best fit a sulfate group, which was present in the crystallization solution at high concentration. In the wild-type periplasmic domain structure two aspartate residues are bound per dimer, but with different occupancies. There exists a ``strong'' aspartate-binding site whose binding is again mediated by four water molecules while the second site contains aspartate whose B-factor is about 10% higher, signifying weaker binding. The interaction between the second, ``weaker'' aspartate with the three ligand-binding arginine side-chains is slightly different from the first site. The major difference is that there are three water molecules mediating the binding of aspartate at the second site, whereas in the first site there are four bridging water molecules. The fact that aspartate-complexed crystals of the wild-type were grown with a large excess aspartate while the cross-linked crystals were grown with equal molar aspartate may explain the difference in the stoichiometry observed. The conservation of the four bridging water molecules in the strong aspartate site of both the cross-linked and wild-type periplasmic domain may reflect an important binding motif. The periplasmic domain in the apo form is a symmetrical dimer, in which each of the subunits is equivalent, and the two aspartate binding sites are identical. Upon the binding of aspartate, the subunits are no longer symmetrical. The main difference between the aspartate-bound and unbound forms is in a small, rigid-body rotation between the subunits within a dimer. The rotation is similar in both direction and magnitude in the crosslinked and wild-type periplasmic domains. The presence of the second aspartate in the wild-type structure does not make any additional rotation compared to the single-site binding. The conservation of the small angular change in vitro suggests that the inter-subunit rotation may have relevance to the understanding of the mechanism of transmembrane signal transduction in vivo.

Introduction
The aspartate receptor is a member of a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate chemotactic response in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. These bacterial chemotaxis receptors are one of the first components in the sensory excitation and

187 N-terminal region. Helix a4 is interrupted by a short non-helical section (residues 150 to 152) and proline at 153 near the aspartate binding site. In the center of the dimer, the central helices a1, a1', a4 and a4' form a quasi-four-helical bundle which has the same overall up-down-up-down topology as that in each individual monomer. These four central helices are presumed to continue through the membrane, and the second transmembrane domains (TM2 and TM2') connect to the cytoplasmic domains in the intact receptor. The dyad axis relating the two halves of the dimer is parallel to the long axis of the bundles, and is centered in the quasi-four-helix bundle (Figure 1). These helical arrangements are also found in the structure of the ligand binding domain of E. coli aspartate receptor (Bowie et al., 1995). Of the three loop regions, loop L1 (residues 77 to 85) has very weak electron density in all of the structures. The model in this region must be viewed as tentative, since multiple conformations (due to either static or dynamic disorder) must exist in this region, even though only a single conformation was used for the refinement. This loop is very exposed to solvent, and it contains many polar residues (77-DASNQQSSA-85). The six-residue loop L2 (110 to 115) is partially ordered and contains two proline residues. Loop 3 is well-defined, and begins with a type I b-turn over the four-residue sequence 141-LDNG-144, which caps helix a3. The dimer contacts are strongest at the top of the receptor, distal from the presumed plane of the membrane. The weakest contacts are towards the N terminus, where helices a1 and a1' diverge. The divergence of these helices may be an artifact due to the absence of transmembrane domains and of the crystal environment. There is evidence that these helices are in close proximity in the intact receptor (Lynch & Koshland, 1991; Pakula & Simon, 1992; Jeffrey & Koshland, 1993). Aspartate recognition and binding The molecular symmetry generates two ligand binding sites per dimeric receptor, both at the dimer interface within the quasi four-a-helix bundle near the top of the molecule, distal from the membrane. Of the two ligand-binding sites, site I is fully occupied and shows clear electron density for an aspartate in both the wild-type and crosslinked complex crystals (Figure 2(a) and (b)), while site I' contains an area of electron density initially with less clear definition. In the WT complex crystals, the density at site I' may be due to a partially occupied aspartate since these crystals were grown under molar excess of aspartate (Figure 2(c)). Crystals of the WT complex were grown in excess aspartate because the initial crosslinked complex crystals showed only one aspartate at site I per receptor dimer (Milburn et al., 1991), while the bound ligand in site I' of the crosslinked structure best fits a sulfate ion from the lithium sulfate solution used as the crystallization salt (Figure 2(d)). In both cases,

adaptation responses in bacteria (Adler, 1969; Koshland, 1981). One means by which bacteria sense changes in the composition of their environment is by binding specific chemicals, called chemoeffectors. When a bacterium senses attractants, it swims toward the source, and when repellents are detected it swims away from the source (Adler, 1969). It does this by modulation of its tumbling frequency according to a bacterial memory of the gradient through which it is swimming (Macnab & Koshland, 1972). Tumbling and smooth swimming are generated by clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the flagella, respectively (Silverman & Simon, 1974; Springer et al., 1977). Bacteria have two major types of receptors: soluble 30 kDa periplasmic binding proteins and 60 kDa receptors which span the periplasmic membrane. The aspartate and serine receptors are primary transmembrane receptors for their respective ligands (Clarke & Koshland, 1979; Wang & Koshland, 1980; Boyd et al., 1983; Bollinger et al., 1984). The Trg protein acts as the ribose and galactose chemoreceptors (Hazelbauer, 1992), and another receptor, the citrate receptor, has recently been reported (Yamamoto et al., 1993). These 60 kDa receptors have similar topological structures and transmembrane signaling mechanisms. They possess three domains: a periplasmic ligandbinding domain, two transmembrane segments, and a cytoplasmic domain. The conservation in the amino acid sequence is 5 to 35% in the periplasmic domain and 60 to 95% in the cytoplasmic domain (Krikos et al., 1983). The difference in the sequence of the periplasmic domain reflects the different ligand binding specificities. The cytoplasmic domain homology reflects that these receptors interact with common downstream chemotaxis proteins to modulate the chemotactic response. We reported earlier the backbone structures of the wild-type (WT) ligand-binding domain (residues 26 to 180) of the aspartate receptor of S. typhmurium in the absence (apo) and presence ° ° (complex) of aspartate to 2.7 A and 3.0 A resolution, respectively (Yeh et al., 1993). We now report the refined structures of the WT apo and complex to ° ° 1.85 A and 2.2 A, respectively, and summarize our structural results on four forms of the ligand-binding domain: the WT apo and complex forms and the apo and complex forms of a crosslinked cysteine mutant (C36).

Results
Topology of the periplasmic domain The periplasmic domain of the aspartate receptor is a dimer of four-a-helix bundles (Figure 1). The two subunits contain helices a1 to a4 and a1' to a4', respectively. On each subunit, these helices span residues 35 (39 in the complex) to 76, 86 to 109, 116 to 144 and 146 to 180, with varying disorder at the

188 the electron density for the aspartate at site I' became clearer only after the model was iteratively refined. Previously, the stoichiometry of aspartate binding was generally assumed to be one aspartate per receptor monomer, because no cooperativity was observed (Mowbray & Koshland, 1990). However, crystallographic studies (Milburn et al., 1991; Yeh et al., 1993) indicate one aspartate per dimer of subunits in the crystals under physiological concentration of aspartate. To test in crystals whether the second site could be occupied by an aspartate after the first site is already occupied, crystals of the cysteine-36 complex were soaked in solutions containing 42 mM aspartate. The difference maps (Fo - Fc )

generated with the data set collected from this crystal gave essentially the same result, with the density in site I' not consistent with a fully occupied aspartate. These results indicate that, when one site is bound with an aspartate, a conformational change is induced in the receptor dimer, which may be the trigger for the signal transduction cascade. Although the receptor can bind another aspartate when the ligand is present in a large excess, further conformational changes are not observed. Furthermore, two binding pockets, sites I and I', do not overlap, and simple steric exclusion of the second site by the first bound ligand cannot be invoked to explain the asymmetric binding of aspartate observed in these crystal structures.

189 recognition. These results agree with the findings of many biochemical and genetic studies identifying Thr154 (Lee & Imae, 1990) Arg64, 69 and 73 (Mowbray & Koshland, 1990) as important for aspartate binding. A recent mutagenesis study of the E. coli aspartate receptor (which is 66% identical to the S. typhmurium in the periplasmic domain) further identified Ser68, Ser70, Tyr149, Phe150 and Gln152 as important for chemotaxis toward aspartate (Gardina et al., 1992). All of these residues are conserved between the two species and are involved in both direct and water-mediated ligand interactions. Water-mediated binding In both the WT and crosslinked complex, four water molecules are found bridging the aspartate ligand and residues in the protein in approximately the same positions (Figure 3(a) and (b)) in site I. Three of the four aspartate carboxyl oxygen atoms bind one water molecule each and all of these water molecules form bridges from the ligand to the protein (Figure 4(a)). These water molecules

Protein-ligand interactions Each binding pocket is formed by Arg64 and residues 149 to 154 from one subunit, and Arg69 and Arg73 from the other. The guanidinium groups of the three arginine residues are found in roughly the same relative orientation in the apo and complex structures, although there are slightly different associations between residues (in particular Arg64) in the presence and absence of aspartate. The three arginine residues form a ``bed'' of positive charges onto which the aspartate binds through its a- and g-carboxyl groups. The amino group of the aspartate ligand points away from the arginine residues, and forms a tight interaction with the residues of the amino binding pocket (residues 149 to 154) at the top of helix a4. This pocket is rich in electronegative groups: the main-chain carbonyls of Tyr149 and Gln162, as well as the side-chain hydroxyls of Thr154, pointing into the focus of the pocket, which contains the aspartate amino group. In addition to these polar interactions, a non-polar contact between the aspartate methylene group and the aromatic ring of Tyr149 is important for ligand binding and

are an integral part of the recognition complex since, in the apo ligand-binding pocket, a dozen water molecules are found (Figure 3(c)) but none occupies the locations identical to the four water molecules found in the complex ligand-binding pocket I. These four water molecules appear to be an inherent characteristic of aspartate binding and may also help partially neutralize the highly positively charged pocket by polar interactions. In the WT complex structure, where the second site I' electron density is best assigned to a more weakly bound aspartate, three water molecules occupy approximately the same positions as in site I (Figure 4(b)). These three bridging water molecules form similar interactions as in the first strong site and the primary difference is the absence of a bridging water that hydrogen bonds to the backbone of Thr154. In the absence of this water molecule, there is minor shifting of the positions of the carboxyl groups relative to the positions in site I. Tyr149 is a critical residue in the water-mediated aspartate binding. One of the bridging water molecules hydrogen bonds to Od of the aspartate,

the hydroxyl of Tyr149 and to the g-hydroxyl of Ser68. Another water hydrogen bonds to the aspartate Oa and the same Tyr149 hydroxyl (Figure 4(a) and (b)). Thus, Tyr149 is critical in defining the aspartate binding pocket at the levels of both direct and water-mediated contacts. Buried surface area Water accessible surface area calculations were done with GRASP (Nicholls, 1992), using the method of Lee & Richards (1971) with a probe ° radius of 1.4 A. The total accessible surface area of ° an apo monomer is 7848 A2 and of the apo dimer ° is 13,997 A2. Upon binding of one aspartate ligand, the accessible surface area of the dimer decreases to ° ° ° 13,912 A2. Of the difference of 85 A2, 46 A2 decrease is due to interaction of aspartate with one monomer ° and 39 A2 decrease is from interactions with the second monomer in the dimer. The dimerization causes a decrease in solvent accessibility at the terminus regions as well, allowing increased association between subunits in the aspartate

Electrostatic potential Electrostatic potentials were calculated with the Poisson-Boltzmann equation as implemented in the program GRASP (Nicholls, 1992) and DELPHI (Biosym), assuming standard formal charges on the amino acid side-chains at pH 7.0 and omitting partial charges. The dielectric constant was set to 2 in the protein region, and 80 in the solvent. A calculation of the electrostatic potential in the absence of aspartate reveals a region of exceptionally strong positive potential centered at the ligand-binding pocket, with values in excess of +3 kT/e- (Figure 5(a) and (c)). This is primarily the result of the unpaired charges on the arginine guanidinium groups. This highly positive potential cavity is partly neutralized by aspartate binding in the complex (Figure 5(b) and (d)). Assuming

standard pKa values for the ionizable groups, the ligand-binding pocket changes from a net charge of +3 to +2 in going from the apo state to the aspartate-bound complex state. Therefore, even in the presence of aspartate, there is an excess of positive charge in the area of the ligand-binding pocket and the polar nature of water molecules, which is not considered in the calculation, may help neutralize this charge. There are additional negative potentials just above and below the aspartatebinding pocket. These potentials may help direct the ligand toward the pocket as it would ``focus'' the positive potential at the ligand-binding pocket. Ligand specificity The aspartate receptor has high ligand-binding specificity, but it also binds other related small

dicarboxylic acids such as glutamate, albeit more weakly (Clarke & Koshland, 1979; Hedblom & Adler, 1983). As mentioned above, all of the amino acid residues that interact with the aspartate ligand and its water molecules are conserved between the E. coli and S. typhimurium aspartate receptors, including the two key aromatic residues Phe150 and Tyr149 that are critical for defining the shape of the pocket. A sequence comparison between the aspartate receptor and the serine receptor from E. coli is puzzling, however, since this related chemoreceptor also has the three arginine residues and is nearly identical in the amino-binding pocket region, yet it has no measurable affinity for aspartate. Both the Thr156 and Arg64 are important for serine binding (Clarke & Koshland, 1979), and these presumably contact the a-amino and a-carboxyl groups. Based on the structure of the S. typhmurium ligand-binding domain, we constructed a model of the ligand-binding domain of the E. coli serine receptor, and of the 13 differences between the two receptors in the regions from residues 60 to 77 and 149 to 160 (sequence numbering relative to the aspartate receptor sequence; the corresponding residue ranges in the serine receptor sequence are 60 to 77 and 151 to 162), three changes may be important in conferring serine specificity. These are at positions 65 (Ile to Asn), 68 (Ser to Asn) and 149 (Tyr to Phe), In the S. typhimurium aspartate receptor, the

side-chains Ser68 and Tyr149 are important in recognizing the aspartate carboxyl groups via water molecules, and thus these positions are likely to be critical for ligand specificity. Ile65, however, may have an indirect effect on ligand specificity. Genetic and biochemical studies (Wolff & Parkinson, 1988; Mowbray & Koshland, 1990; Gardina; et al., 1992) showed that mutations at residues Arg64, Ser68, Arg69, Ser70, Gln152 and Thr154 are no longer sensitive to aspartate, but still respond normally to maltose (in the case of E. coli aspartate receptor, which responds to aspartate and maltose-bound maltose binding protein). Based on our structure of the aspartate receptor's ligandbinding domain complex, the importance of Arg64 and Thr154 for sensing aspartate, and presumably of serine in the serine receptor, is logical. However, the results that mutations at Arg69 and Arg73 of the aspartate receptor have less of an effect on the aspartate response than at R64 is intriguing, since these side-chains also interact with the ligand side-chain. Both the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic effects of these residues may be important for the aspartate recognition and signaling. Another factor in ligand specificity is the shape of the pocket, which determines the steric fit of the particular ligand. This shape is determined by many residues in addition to those directly lining the surface, and thus residues other than

194 those in the immediate vicinity of the pocket may be an important factor in mediating ligand specificity. Structural differences between the apo and complex forms of the ligand-binding domain In the apo form of both the Cys36 crosslinked and WT ligand-binding domain, there is one subunit per asymmetric unit and a crystallographic 2-fold axis relates the two subunits as well as two aspartate binding sites within the dimer. In the complexed form, there is a single dimer per asymmetric unit and the dimer axis does not coincide with a crystallographic 2-fold axis, so that the complex dimer possesses a pseudo-symmetry with a rotation angle of 178.2° in the WT form and 179.1° in the crosslinked form. The binding of aspartate induces asymmetry within the dimer such that the two monomer subunits within the dimer are not equivalent. In previously reported results (Milburn et al., 1991; Scott et al., 1993; Yeh et al., 1993), the role of the small intermolecular rotation that was observed on aspartate binding was inconclusive. In the crosslinked structures, there existed the possibility that the change observed was an artifact resulting from the crosslinking or due to the different crystal-packing environments. Although similar changes were observed with the initial wild-type structures (Yeh et al., 1993), the intermediate resolution of these structures necessarily limited the interpretation. With the current high-resolution structures, we can now address the validity of our earlier results and conclusions. In comparing the apo and complex forms of the ligand-binding domain to determine conformational changes due to the binding of aspartate, only the pairs Aapo/Acomplex (for nomenclature, see Figure 6) and Bapo/Bcomplex need to be compared, since the apo dimer has strict 2-fold symmetry, i.e. Aapo = Bapo; the Aapo/Bcomplex and Bapo/ Acomplex pairs are redundant. The apo and complexed forms of the receptor ligand-binding domain have been compared by both superposition and ``difference distance matrix'' methods. In the superposition method, the backbone atoms from residues 48 to 75, 88 to 113, 118 to 144, and 155 to 175 were selected (440 atoms), and the root-mean-square (rms) difference in their pair-wise distances were minimized by fitting one structure onto the other by the method of Kabsch (1976). Outlier atoms were removed from the set by first minimizing the rms value, then removing those atoms whose distances deviated by more than three times the rms value of the set. This procedure was repeated until no more atoms were excluded, Superposition of the A monomers of the WT apo and complex dimers results in an overall rms of ° 0.40 A (315 atoms compared) and of the Cys36 ° crosslinked results in 0.40 A (379 atoms compared). When this is done, there is poor agreement between ° ° the two B halves (rms 1.65 A in WT and 1.43 A in

Aspartate Receptor Structure

crosslinked: Figure 6(a) and (c)). Conversely, when the two B halves are superposed, the rms for the ° WT is 0.49 A (343 atoms) and the crosslinked is ° 0.24 A (365 atoms), there is a poor match of the A ° ° monomers (rms = 1.70 A in WT and 1.19 A in Cys36 crosslinked; Figure 6(b) and (d). The rising and falling pattern seen on the side of the plots where the receptor halves have not been fit is what would be expected if the monomers differed by a relative rotation within the dimers. After fitting two A halves, the operation that brings the remaining two B halves into coincidence (Hendrickson, 1979) can be described as a rotation of one B subunit with respect to the other around an axis by about 3.0° in the WT and 4.2° in the crosslinked form. The rotation axis in the crosslinked ligand-binding domain is closer to the disulfide bond, in the lower region of the receptor, while, in the WT, the pivot axis is closer to the aspartate binding site. This axis is roughly parallel to the plane of the membrane, and perpendicular to the plane of the dimer interface. The choice of atoms used in the superpositioning affects the locations of the axis and the rotation values. In both cases, the rotational direction and magnitude are similar. The exact choice of atoms used for the fit can significantly affect the comparison and thus the changes in the structures were also analyzed with a difference distance matrix. In this particular application, the distances between all pairs of Ca atoms within the dimer were first calculated for both the apo and complex structures. The differences between these distances were then calculated and displayed as a contour plot. Since this method does not rely on the optimal fitting of atomic positions, the settings of the original coordinates do not matter. In addition, this type of plot has the further advantage that changes can be studied between various parts of the structure, and not only between the atoms that have been mapped to each other. The difference distance matrix of both the WT and crosslinked structures is clearly ``flatter'' in the A/A and B/B regions than in the A/B region (Figure 7). The strongest features in the plot are found the A/B section, which describes changes in distances between A and B monomers. Vectors between pairs of atoms on the same subunit differ little between the apo and complex structures indicating that, to a large degree, the individual subunits are not affected by aspartate binding. This is in agreement with the results obtained based on the best rms fit of the coordinates (Figure 6). The simplest interpretation of the larger difference distances between A and B monomers is a rigid body rotation of A with respect to B subunit by 3 to 4.2°. Since the ligand binding pocket is at the dimer interface, the aspartate binds both monomers simultaneously, and in effect ``links'' them together. This closes the binding pocket slightly, and brings the upper regions of the two monomers close

together. The monomers realign and become more parallel, increasing the contact area between the monomers, especially in the upper region of the receptor. In the complex form, there are more subunit contacts between the monomers relative to

the apo form, in addition to the expected ligand-associated contacts. Beside this subunit rotation mentioned above, there are small differences present within the monomer subunits. They are localized mainly to

The regions of A/A and B/B are ``flatter'' and indicate small distance difference rms values. This contour plot was calculated using only helical residues away from the loops and helical ends.

the N and C-terminal regions, which are lacking transmembrane regions, and in the second loop region, loop 112 to 116, which contains two proline residues. Whether these differences, which are different between the crosslinked and WT structures, are significant is still unknown. It may be that the combination of both an intra- and intermolecular change is part of the signaling mechanism.

Discussion
The main difference between the high-resolution structures of the apo and complex forms of the periplasmic domain is the small, approximately 3 to 4°, rigid-body rotation of one monomer subunit with respect to the other in the dimeric domain. This small rotation is also seen in the intermediate resolution WT structures (Yeh et al., 1993) and in the crosslinked structures (Milburn et al., 1991) from the crystals formed under different conditions

in different crystal forms. Although small in magnitude, this inter-subunit rotation force must be greater than crystal lattice force, because all our attempts to soak aspartate into pre-formed apo protein crystals caused the crystals to crack. Thus, the inter-subunit rotation observed here is real, and not likely due to either crystallization conditions or crystal lattice force. These results are, however, in conflict with the results based on in vivo crosslinking experiment (Milligan & Koshland, 1993; Lee et al., 1995), which suggest that the conformational change caused by aspartate binding is confined within the monomer subunit. Based on the structural findings of the ligandbinding domain and biochemical findings on the binding of ligands to the intact receptor, several models of the signal transduction mechanism have been proposed, some involving changes of intersubunit conformation (Milburn et al., 1991; Yeh et al., 1993; Kim et al., 1992; Kim, 1994; Stoddard &

Aspartate Receptor Structure

197 results cited earlier have indicated that only one site is fully occupied at physiological concentrations of aspartate. The new results on the second aspartate in the high-resolution WT complex structure does not additionally increase or otherwise affect the magnitude of the inter-subunit rotation observed with single aspartate binding. This result, along with 19F-NMR (Danielson, et al., 1994), indicates that the binding of a second ligand, if bound at all, does not detectably alter or enhance the conformational change induced by the binding of the first ligand, and the effective stoichiometry under physiological aspartate concentration is one aspartate per receptor dimer. Mechanisms for the single site occupation under physiological concentration of aspartate are, however, not obvious. One could invoke two possible mechanisms: (1) small conformational changes in the second site may be induced by the aspartate binding of the first site (Biemann & Koshland, 1994) or (2) ``freezing'' of dynamic state of dimeric receptor on the first aspartate binding could close the entrance to the second site as suggested in the ``frozen dynamic model'' (Kim, 1994). Another point of interest is the fact that all the crystals studied so far are obtained from solutions of high salt concentration (Table 1). This is especially true for the apo proteins. All efforts so far to obtain crystals under low salt concentration have failed. Bowie et al. (1995) suggest that the apo protein dimers may be too dynamic to be crystallized, and that, only when the aspartate binding sites are charge-neutralized by either aspartate or high salt, the dimer becomes conformationally fixed to be crystallized. They support this notion by showing that E. coli receptors transmit signals partially in high salt even in the absence of aspartate. If this were true, under more physiological salt concentrations, the inter-subunit rotation may be larger than we observed in crystals formed in high salt. The present studies add appreciably to the knowledge of the structure-function of the receptor. Because there can be questions about the particular studies on the basis of truncation of the receptor, high non-physiological salt selections, soluble portions lacking transmembrane domains, etc., it would require more work to resolve the discrepancies.

As yet, no experimental results account for both crystallographic and biochemical observations discussed above. The stoichiometry of one aspartate per receptor dimer is intriguing, since there exist two equivalent sites in the apo form. Both structural and solution

Materials and Methods
The first crystal structures of the ligand-binding domain of the aspartate receptor of S. typhmurium were on a crosslinked C36 mutant protein (Milburn et al., 1991). Initial attempts at obtaining WT ligand-binding domain crystals yielded non-diffracting crystals. In the electron density map of the crosslinked apo and complex, the regions between residues 25 to 31 and 181 to 188 were found to be disordered. The C-terminal deletion of residues 181 to 188 (singly truncated) produced the ligand binding domain containing residues 25 to 180. This singly truncated sample produced crystals of

° aspartate complex at 3 A resolution. A subsequent deletion of residues 25 to 35 (doubly truncated) produced the ligand-binding domain containing residues Met and 36 to 180, producing crystals of both the apo and complex ° ° forms which diffracted to 1.85 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. All the aspartate complex crystals were obtained by co-crystallization. Various attempts to soak aspartate into preformed apo-protein crystals resulted in the destruction of the crystals. Table 1 describes experimental conditions used to obtain the crystals, the space groups and cell parameters, and number of aspartates or other ligands bound in the crystals discussed in this paper. Notice that all the crystals were obtained only under high salt concentrations. We were unable to obtain crystals from low salt conditions. Protein purification Purification of each of the truncated domains was accomplished essentially as described for the parent protein (Milligan & Koshland, 1993). Briefly, the protein was precipitated from the supernatant of a preparation of osmotically shocked cells using ammonium sulfate (28% w/v for the singly truncated and 35% w/v for the doubly truncated protein). Chromatography was performed on Q Sepharose, Sephadex G-75, hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q columns. Several forms of each protein were resolved on Mono Q, apparently resulting from the removal of a few amino acids or covalent addition. High-quality crystals were obtained from one form of each protein. In the case of the doubly truncated version, a further step was necessary: the Mono Q peak was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 and passed through a Mono S column, that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. Although the protein did not bind to the column under these conditions, contaminating proteins were removed as evidenced by the significantly improved diffracting crystals of both the apo and complex forms. Structure determination and refinement The crystallization conditions, space groups, and cell parameters of all crystal forms obtained thus far for the ligand-binding domain of the aspartate receptor of S. typhmurium are summarized in Table 1. Notice that the crystals form under many different conditions and in

several space groups, but only under relatively high salt conditions. All WT data were collected on an R-AXIS II phosphor imaging-plate system. The structures of the WT apo and complex were determined by molecular replacement methods using XPLOR 3.1 programs, with the monomeric, crosslinked apo structure as the probe, and omitting the disordered loop region (residues 75 to 85) and the truncated residues (residues 25 to 35 and 181 to 188) from the probe model. Patterson correlation refinement (Brunger, 1990) on possible rotation solutions ¨ yielded rotation and translation solutions for both forms of the WT periplasmic domain. Refinement of the structures was continued through XPLOR and included iterative cycles of conjugate gradient minimizations, simulated annealing, and isotropic, individual B-factor refinement. This was coupled to simulated annealing/omit maps to reduce model bias and confirm the correctness of the solution, especially at the N and C-terminal regions, the aspartate binding sites, and loop regions. Omit maps were ° generated after omitting from the model a region of 3 A radius around a particular residue(s) and refining the ° remainder of the molecule. The atoms outside of a 3 A radius were restrained from artificial movement into the omitted region. Simulated annealing was used with a slow-cooling protocol, where the initial temperature was set to 3000 K with 0.5 fs/100 K timesteps. SigmaA (sA) weighting (Read, 1986) was used to obtain weights for ° resolution shells initially from 10 to 1.85 A and 10 to ° ° ° 2.2 A, and later for 6 to 1.85 A and 6 to 2.2 A, respectively, for the apo and complex forms, The mean coordinate ° error for the 1.85 A apo structure, as estimated from sA ° ° is 0.08 A and for the complex, it is 0.11 A. Refinement statistics are listed in Table 2. Solvent molecules were assigned after the model was refined to an R-factor of 26%. The average temperature factor of all atoms is about ° 28 A2 for both the apo and complex structures, omitting the highly disordered residues at loop 1, which has a ° B-factor of about 80 A2. The Ramanchandran plots (Figure 8(a) and (b)) show that, of the 123 and 240 non-glycine and non-proline residues of the apo and complex, respectively, 95% and 92% are in the most-favored positions. Of the outliers in the complex, four are at the terminus regions and one is in loop 2 which contains two proline residues. The highly disordered loop 1, from residues 75 to 85, was omitted from the calculation.
