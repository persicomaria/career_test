Bacterial cold shock proteins (CSPs) regulate cellular adaptation to cold stress. Functions ascribed to CSP include roles as RNA chaperones and in transcription antitermination. We present the crystal structure of the Bacillus caldolyticus CSP (Bc-Csp) in complex with hexathymidine (dT6) at a ° resolution of 1.29 A. Bound to dT6, crystalline Bc-Csp forms a domainswapped dimer in which b strands 1­3 associate with strands 4 and 5 from the other subunit to form a closed b barrel and vice versa. The globular units of dimeric Bc-Csp closely resemble the well-known structure of monomeric CSP. Structural reorganization from the monomer to the domain-swapped dimer involves a strictly localized change in the peptide bond linking Glu36 and Gly37 of Bc-Csp. Similar structural reorganizations have not been found in any other CSP or oligonucleotide / oligosaccharide-binding fold structures. Each dT6 ligand is bound to one globular unit of Bc-Csp via an amphipathic protein surface. Individual binding subsites interact with the DNA bases through stacking and hydrogen bonding. The sugar­phosphate backbone remains solvent exposed. Based on crystallographic and biochemical studies of deoxyoligonucleotide binding to CSP, we suggest a common mode of binding of single-stranded heptanucleotide motifs to proteins containing cold shock domains, including the eukaryotic Y-box factors.

When bacteria are subjected to a temperature decrease of about 10 °C, they respond with an adaptive mechanism known as the cold shock response. Consequently, the expression of most cellular genes is downregulated, and the expression of some genes involved in cellular adaptation to cold stress is upregulated [1­3]. Although most genes involved in the cold shock response vary between species, a conserved set of genes encoding the major cold shock proteins (CSP) has been found in more than 400 different bacteria, including hyperthermophilic, thermophilic, mesophilic

and psychrophilic species. The CSP consist of 65­70 amino acids and bind to single-stranded nucleic acids with micromolar to nanomolar dissociation constants (KD). The precise cellular function of the CSP is under investigation. In vitro, Ec-CspA, a major CSP from Escherichia coli, has been shown to prevent the formation of mispaired RNA duplex structures in a sequence-unspecific manner [4]. Such structures are expected to form preferentially at low temperatures and may interfere with translation or cause mRNA

degradation. Therefore, the CSP have been designated as mRNA chaperones, which help to maintain protein synthesis at low temperatures. In a different study, Ec-CspA, Ec-CspC and Ec-CspE, whose synthesis is upregulated during cold stress, were shown to function as transcription antiterminators of cold-induced genes both in vitro and in vivo [5]. Moreover, CSP have been implicated in nucleoid condensation, the coupling of transcription and translation, and regulation of translation [6­9]. Although it has been suggested that CSP bind to Y-box sequences with high affinity [10], binding experiments with oligonucleotides have shown that both Ec-CspA and Bs-CspB from Bacillus subtilis preferentially bind to pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides [11,12]. Binding to the Y-box sequence, either alone or in a poly(T) context, was negligible [13,14]; the highest affinities of CSP were reported for thymine (T)- or uracil (U)-rich sequences. Several CSP structures have been determined using X-ray crystallography [15­18] and NMR spectroscopy [19,20], including Ec-CspA, Bs-CspB and the CSP from Bacillus caldolyticus (Bc-Csp) and Thermotoga maritima (Tm-Csp). The peptide chains of the CSP are arranged as five antiparallel b strands, separated by four loops and folded into a closed b barrel [21]. This fold belongs to the oligonucleotide / oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold [22]. It is conserved in eukaryotic Ybox proteins [23], which contain structures in addition to the cold shock domain (CSD) shared with the bacterial CSP. A recently determined crystal structure of Bs-CspB in complex with dT6 [24] and data from solution NMR experiments characterizing the binding of dT7 to Bs-CspB [25] has shown that T-rich DNA single strands bind to an amphipathic protein surface. Several residues participating in ligand binding are located in regions designated as RNP motifs I and II, which can also be found in other RNA-binding proteins [26,27]. Here we present the high-resolution crystal structure Bc-Csp in complex with dT6. Unexpectedly, in this crystal structure, Bc-Csp is present in a domainswapped dimeric structure not observed in oligonucleotide / oligosaccharide binding fold (OB-fold) proteins. The domain swap pairs one half, b strands 1­3, of Bc-Csp with the other half, b strands 4 and 5, of a second molecule and serves as proof of an unanticipated structural plasticity in the CSD. In contrast to a previously determined Bs-CspBÆdT6 structure [24] in which the DNA strands bridge adjacent protein molecules in the crystal lattice, each hexathymidine strand is associated with one CSD. Nevertheless, very similar
1266

ligand-binding subsites are observed in Bs-CspB and Bc-Csp, and the mode of DNA binding is dominated by stacking interactions between nucleobases and aromatic protein side chains for both proteins. Based on this observation and on binding assays using a set of heptapyrimidines, a model of CSPÆheptanucleotide binding is presented and a common mode of oligonucleotide binding to CSD is proposed.

replacement using a crystal structure of Bc-Csp without a ligand (1C9O). The crystal's asymmetric unit contains a swapped dimer of Bc-Csp (chains A and B) in contact with two DNA molecules (chains C and D) (Fig. 1). Two methylpentanediol molecules from the crystallization setup, which are associated with the protein­DNA complex, were included in the structural model. The structure was refined using refmac v. 5.1.24 to final Rwork / Rfree values of 13.1 and 16.3%. The electron density is well defined, all heavy atoms from protein and ligand molecules could be placed. Bc-Csp overall structure and domain swap In the Bc-Csp structure the two protein chains form a swapped dimer with two globular functional units which are composed of residues 1­35 from one protein chain and residues 38­65 from another protein chain (Figs 1A, 2). The architecture of the functional units closely resembles that of all other structural models of CSP, featuring five highly curved antiparallel b strands connected by four loops and a short 310 helix at the Cterminus of b3. In the nonswapped (closed monomeric) structures the respective b strands 1­3 and 4+5 are arranged as two b sheets which form a closed b barrel. In the domain-swapped structure, the first b sheet of

one chain assembles with a second b sheet from a different chain and vice versa. The swapped chains can be interrelated by a noncrystallographic twofold rotation axis. The functional units align well with the structures of the two models of the closed protein ° (1C9O) giving RMSD values of < 0.5 A for all a-carbon atoms. Both functional units superimpose with an ° rmsd of 0.1 A, and the phosphorus atoms of the sugar­phosphate backbone from both DNA chains ° superimpose with an rmsd of 0.23 A. Formation of a swapped dimer reduces the solvent-accessible surface ° per subunit by 5.4% (493 A2). The Bc-Csp domain swap provides insight into the folding and misfolding of the CSP The Bc-Csp domain swap occurs in the middle of loop L34 and is promoted by a unique combination of torsion angles Glu36w and Gly37/, compared with closed monomers. Interestingly, crystal structures of monomeric Bc-Csp show a two-state conformational variability at these torsion angles: of 10 protein models from six different Bc-Csp crystal structures [17,18], six models display Glu36w / Gly37/ mean torsion angles of 162 ± 14° / 99 ± 5°, designated as state 1. The other models show mean torsion angles of

)15 ± 15° / )65 ± 8°, designated as state 2 (Fig. 2A,B). In all crystal structures featuring two protein molecules, one molecule maintains Glu36w / Gly37/ torsion angles according to state 1, whereas the other molecule adopts a conformation according to state 2. All other torsion angles in Bc-Csp represent single states with standard deviations of < 20°, except for the terminal residues. The torsion angle differences between states 1 and 2, 183° for Glu36w and )164° for Gly37/, roughly compensate for each other and do not result in noticeable tertiary structural deviations between monomers in state 1 and state 2. In contrast to closed Bc-Csp structures, the two polypeptide chains of the swapped dimer show Glu36w / Gly37/ torsion angle combinations of 141 ± 4° (similar to state 1) and )85 ± 1° (similar to state 2). This results in
1268

effective $ 180° rotations of their main chains at Glu36w, causing the Bc-Csp structures to open up and allowing them to re-associate as domain-swapped dimers. Apart from differences in the course of the protein backbone at the point of transition, in the swapped dimer the overall structure of the functional units is not altered significantly as compared to the closed monomers in state 1 and 2. In the open state, the monomer of Bc-Csp is partitioned into two subdomains of similar length, which are separated by a long loop. Subdomain 1 is a sheet including b strands 1­3, subdomain 2 is a b ladder comprising strands 4 and 5. In closed monomers, these two subdomains are stabilized by 26 backbone hydrogen bonds; the interface between the subdomains contains eight backbone hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3).

DNA single-strand binding to the cold shock domain

Fig. 3. Topology plot of Bc-Csp. b-Strands are depicted as blue (subdomain 1) and green (subdomain 2) arrows. Intra- and intersubdomain hydrogen bonds from the protein backbone are indicated as black and grey arrows (donor acceptor). All hydrogen bonds can be observed in the closed as well as domain-swapped Bc-CspB structural models. In the latter case, intersubdomain hydrogen bonds are formed between different protein chains. Residues 36 and 37 are depicted in pink. Their backbone torsion angles display a twostate conformational variability in closed CSP structures and enable the domain swap observed in the Bc-CspBÆdT6 structure.

Almost all of these interactions can also be found in the swapped dimers. From 15N relaxation and H / Dexchange NMR experiments of Bs-CspB, which shares 86% sequence identity and a closely similar tertiary fold with Bc-Csp, we expect that loop L34, which divides the subdomains, remains flexible even in the folded state of the protein [25]. A state similar to that of the open monomer may reflect a substate in the folding pathway of Bc-Csp. In such an arrangement, the subdomains may form independently from an unfolded chain (Fig. 2C). Formation of the subdomains would contribute two thirds of all backbone hydrogen bonds and stimulate the organization of a bipartite hydrophobic core, which would be solvent exposed at this stage. The association of subdomains results in the formation of the closed b barrel burying

the hydrophobic core. At present there is no experimental evidence for the occurrence of the domainswapped form of Bc-Csp or any other CSP in solution or inside bacterial cells. However, the Bc-Csp crystal structure reveals an unanticipated structural polymorphism. The domain-swapped form of the protein must be close in energy to the globular monomeric state, because otherwise these crystals could not have formed. We cannot discount the possibility that its formation has been overlooked in previous biochemical studies of CSPs. Further studies are required to evaluate its physiological relevance. It has been shown that Ec-CspA, which shares 57% sequence identity with Bc-Csp, aggregates forming amyloid fibrils under acidic conditions [28]. Analysis of this amyloid formation using NMR techniques has revealed time-dependent changes in 15N T2 relaxation accompanying the exponential phase of polymerization, which suggest that the first three b strands may form association interfaces that promote aggregate growth. In the late stage of amyloid formation, signals from the N-terminal half of the molecules (equivalent to residues 5­36 in Bc-Csp) appear to be more severely broadened than those from the C-terminal half. This may be relevant for folding, because Ec-CspA in this experiment shows a bipartite organization resembling that of the open state of Bs-CspB. Domain swapping of a further b-sheet protein, ribonuclease A, has recently been implicated in amyloidogenesis [29]. For this enzyme, swapped dimers may be formed in solution, which can be isolated from closed monomers using chromatographic techniques [30,31]. A swapped dimer was formed from two different defective ribonuclease A variants by complementation involving the swapping of functional subdomains [29,32]. Using a similar approach, amyloid fibres of ribonuclease A were generated, for which enzymatic activity could be demonstrated [29]. It has thus been suggested that amyloid cross-b spines consisting of extended b sheets may also be formed from domainswapped protein assemblies with retained native structure. This model of amyloid protofilament formation may also be relevant for the CSP and may explain why a bipartite organization can be observed in the late stage of Ec-CspA amyloidogenesis [28]. To form extended linear fibrils by swapping subdomains, an arrangement different to that seen in the Bc-CspÆdT6 crystal structure, in which two chains form a closed dimeric arrangement, would be required. Because the domain-swapped dimer of Bc-Csp has only been observed in the presence of a bound dT6 strand, the question remains whether DNA binding to the CSP is responsible for domain swapping.

solution data have only indicated the formation of complexes consisting of one protein and one ligand molecule for ligands in the range of hexa- or heptanucleotides (data not shown). The Bs-CspBÆdT6 structure [24] clearly demonstrates that a domain swap is not required for ligand binding to the CSP. Most protein­ ligand contacts of the two structures are in good agreement (see below), suggesting that domain swapping does not change the ligand interaction sites of the CSP. Preferential binding of different pyrimidine-based oligonucleotides to Bc-Csp It has been shown that homologous Bs-CspB has a general binding preference for polypyrimidines over polypurines, and its binding site has been suggested to interact with 6­7 nucleotides [12­14]. In order to further analyse the preferential binding of heptanucleotides, we performed binding studies using deoxyheptapyrimidines (Table 2). The selected oligonucleotides differ from each other only by single pyrimidine bases and thus allow us to determine the effect of thymineto-cytosine base changes at different sequence positions in a heptanucleotide sequence by relating the KD values of the respective Bc-CspÆoligonucleotide complexes to each other (Table 2; KD1 / KD2). To prevent slippage of oligonucleotides within the binding site, caused by single nucleotide changes within homogenous T-rich surroundings, we used a less degenerate oligonucleotide (CTCTTTC) as a scaffold, which is bound with similar affinity as dT7. The binding experiments show that there is only a small preference for T over C at positions 1, 4, 5 and 7, associated with an increase in the KD value of up to threefold. At positions 2 (Table 2, CT3, CT7) and 6 (Table 2, CT3, CT5) the decrease in affinity was significantly stronger: When C was introduced at these positions the KD increased 93- or 11-fold. By contrast, at position 3 (Table 2, CT2, CT3) C was preferred

slightly over T, with an associated 2.5-fold decrease in KD. dT6 is bound to a hydrophobic platform on the protein surface Globular functional units of Bc-Csp have a strongly dipolar surface (Fig. 4B). One side has a prominent negative surface potential which is derived from acidic side chains. On the opposite side, several solventexposed aromatic side chains form a hydrophobic platform surrounded by basic and by polar groups. This amphipathic interface associates with dT6 via various hydrophobic- and hydrogen-bonding interactions. In the following description, the interactions between protein and ligand are observed in the ligand-binding interfaces of both functional units unless stated otherwise. Protein groups forming the ligand-binding surface originate from the first three b strands and loop 3; many are located within the RNP motifs RNP1 (Lys13­Val20) and RNP2 (Val26­Phe30), which are conserved in various RNA-binding proteins [27,33]. Further groups participating in ligand binding are located in b5, L34 and L45 (Fig. 5). Oligonucleotide binding to Bc-Csp is dominated by stacking interactions that involve single stacks between the side chains of Trp8, Phe17 and Phe27, and the nucleobases of T6, T5 and T4, respectively. An impressive five-member stack is formed by successive side chain and nucleobase groups from T3, His29, Phe30, T1 and Phe38. T2 is contacted through an edge-on stack by Phe30. Shielding of Val26, Val28 and Tyr15 also may contribute to ligand binding, because the solvent-exposed location of these side chains in the absence of a ligand is expected to be thermodynamically unfavourable. The polar contribution to ligand binding involves eight hydrogen bonds and five water-mediated interactions between protein and DNA groups. Two hydrogen bonds are formed between backbone groups of

chain shows great conformational flexibility in the set of ligand-free CSP structures and interacts with the nucleobase group in the structure of Bs-CspBÆdT6. Upon ligand binding the solvent-accessible surface from a ° functional unit is reduced by 16.2% (696 A2), of which 65 and 35% can be assigned to hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas, respectively. Structural organization of the ligand The dT6 ligand adopts an extended, irregular conformation. Looking from the protein surface towards the ligand, the sugar­phosphate backbone appears curved like a `C' (Fig. 6), with the nucleobases pointing towards the protein surface. The 5¢-to-3¢ polarity of the ligand follows that of most other nucleic acid complexes of OB-fold proteins, starting in the vicinity of L12, proceeding along the N­C polarity of b2 and pointing towards the kink in b1 (Fig. 4A). There is no stacking between nucleobases, and all nucleosides are in the anti conformation. The solvent-exposed sugar­ phosphate backbone shields the hydrophobic nucleobases and the hydrophobic-binding platform of the protein below them from the polar solvent (Fig. 2B). The sugar of T1 from chain C maintains a C4¢-exo pucker, whereas the remaining sugars adopt C2¢-endo puckers, which are typical of double-stranded B-DNA. In ligand chain D, the terminal nucleotides adopt a C3¢-endo conformation, which is typical of doublestranded A-DNA and RNA, whereas all other nucleotides display C2¢-endo puckers. All sugar puckers observed in the Bc-CspÆdT6 structure are within energetically favourable regions of the pentose pseudorotation cycle [34] and the exocyclic angles of the sugar­ phosphate backbone are within limits observed in tRNA structures [35]. Assignment of seven common interaction subsites to Bc-Csp and Bs-CspB In the Bc-CspÆdT6 complex, each DNA molecule binds to one globular functional unit of a swapped dimer. In contrast to the swapped dimer complex of Bc-CspÆdT6, closed protein monomers and ligand molecules form an interspersed arrangement in the related Bs-CspBÆdT6 complex [24]. (Figures 7 and 8 give a schematical and structural comparison of both hexathymidine complex structures.) Many interactions between protein and DNA ligand molecules are common to both structures, yet certain interactions can only be observed with either Bs-CspB or Bc-Csp. Based on the two structures, we can now define a common interaction interface that allows us to understand

A gap between the 3' nucleotide (bound to subsite 2) and the first structured 5' nucleotide (bound to subsite 4) exists, which is expected to bind the unstructured T1 nucleotide (grey). (C) In solution, all seven subsites are occupied by a single oligonucleotide molecule.

the backbone of Lys39 in a geometry reminiscent of a Watson­Crick TA base pair. The existence of a third contact site has been hypothesized in the Bs-CspB structure based on missing electron density for the 5¢ nucleotide, which was expected to be located at this position. In Bc-CspÆdT6, a third subsite was found as anticipated. It involves the side chain of His29, which reveals an edge-on contact with the nucleobase and a hydrogen bond with the deoxyribose ring oxygen of the nucleoside in subsite 3. In contact subsites 4 and 5, the side chains of His29 and Phe27 stack with bases from adjacent nucleotides. Gln59 contacts their nucleobase head groups via hydrogen bonds. In the Bc-CspÆdT6 structure an additional hydrogen bond provided by the backbone carbonyl group of Pro58 contacts the nucleobase. In subsite 6, a nucleobase stacks against Phe17 while its head groups interact with the side chains of Asp25, Lys7 and Trp8 via hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the orientations of the nucleobases in this subsite differ between the oligothymidine complexes of Bc-Csp and Bs-CspB. They may be related by a 180° rotation. Consequently, O2 is contacted by Lys7 and Trp8 in the Bc-CspÆdT6 complex structure instead of O4 as observed in the Bs-CspBÆdT6 structure.

The most prominent difference between the two CSPÆoligothymidine complexes involves interaction subsite 7. In the Bc-Csp structure, the 3¢ nucleotide stacks against Trp8, its O2 is contacted by Asn10. In the Bs-CspB structure, Trp8 is inaccessible due to a crystal contact. An alternative seventh binding site was attributed to a hydrogen bond between Arg56 and the O2 of the nucleobase. However, after evaluating both crystal structures we conclude that the alternative orientation of the base and sugar­phosphate backbone of the nucleotide in subsite 6 and the formation of the alternative subsite 7 are a consequence of the inaccessibility of Trp8 in this crystal form. In addition to their structures, Bc-Csp and Bs-CspB also share functional similarities. Both proteins bind dT7 with a similar affinity of KD values of 0.9 ± 0.2 1.8 ± 0.2 nm (Table 2) [24]. In solution, their highest preference for T was observed for positions 2 and 6 in a heptanucleotide. Replacement of T by C at these positions results in significantly decreased affinities as observed by 93- and 11-fold increased KD values for Bc-Csp. These distinct preferences are in good agreement with the deduced binding mode, in which the most specific contacts for thymine head groups are formed at nucleobase subsites 2 and 6.

Fig. 8. Stereoview of the structurally conserved CSP ligand-binding surface. Structures of the nucleobase ligands from the Bs-CspBÆdT6 (grey, black font) and BcCspÆdT6 (green) complexes have been shifted (upper) to allow a better view on the CSP binding site (lower). Lines schematically relate individual nucleobases to their position in the complex structures. Protein groups involved in nucleobase interactions in the complex structures are shown as sticks in corresponding colours. Their equivalents from CSP structures without an oligonucleotide ligand are displayed as blue lines.

T-to-C changes at positions 4, 5 and 7 did not significantly influence the affinity of dT7 for Bc-Csp, whereas in binding studies with Bs-CspB weak preferences for T were observed. At sequence position 3, a cytosine base is preferred to thymine by both CSPs. Although the preference of Bc-Csp for individual nucleotides at most positions was not as pronounced as with Bs-CspB, they clearly follow the same trend. The smaller base discrimination by Bc-Csp may be related to the fact that all fluorescence titration measurements were performed at 15 °C to allow comparison. Although for B. subtilis this temperature is close to its growth conditions, the temperature optimum for B. caldolyticus is more than 40 °C higher. Functional implications The common features of most nucleobase interaction subsites suggest that both Bc-Csp and Bs-CspB share identical ligand-binding interfaces (Fig. 8), whereas differences in binding involving subsites 6 and 7, as well as the arrangement of protein and DNA molecules, appear to arise from different crystal-packing environments. Despite the fact that heptanucleotides rather than hexanucleotides fully occupy the CSP binding site [12,25], we have not yet found suitable crystallization conditions for CSP in complex with heptadeoxynucleotides. Likewise, attempts to grow crystals of Bs-CspB in the presence of oligoribonucleotides have remained unsuccessful. In contrast to the individual Bs-CspB
1274

and Bc-CspÆhexathymidine complex structures, the combined structural models allow us to understand how both CSPs bind thymine-rich heptanucleotide motifs and explain binding preferences seen in biochemical binding studies in solution. Although the CSPÆdT6 crystal structures contain an single-strand DNA ligand, they support the assumption that single-strand RNA ligands bind the same way, because the exposed sugar 2¢OH groups and the missing methyl groups of uridines would not enhance or impair ligand binding, and the backbone torsion angles of the DNA ligands are compatible with data obtained from tRNA crystal structures. The extended irregular conformation of dT6 oligonucleotides in the binding site, the unstacking of bases with respect to each other upon binding, and the shielding of the nucleobase head groups by the protein suggest that the CSP may counteract double-strand formation in nucleic acids. CSP surface properties favour the binding of thymine-rich sequences, with the exception of nucleobase binding subsite 2, which favours cytosine. The biological functions of CSP are still under investigation. Certain CSP have initially been reported to function as transcriptional activators of cold-induced genes such as hns [36] and gyrA, encoding a subunit of DNA gyrase [37]. The ability of CSP to bind to singlestranded nucleic acids and prevent their association to double strands in vitro led to the assumption that these proteins may function as RNA chaperones [4], which may prevent the formation of mRNA double strands

DNA single-strand binding to the cold shock domain

at low temperatures. Whether mRNA base pairing indeed impairs gene expression in the cold and whether CSP binding can prevent this remains to be shown. It is clear, however, that the CSP are required for cold adaptation. Strains of B. subtilis, with two of three CSP genes inactivated show severe restrictions in growth at low temperatures [3]. Likewise, an Escherichia coli strain with four (of nine) CSP genes inactivated is cold sensitive and impaired in upregulation of many cold-induced genes [38]. For RNA chaperone activity, a low-affinity sequence-unspecific binding of mRNA by CSP may be sufficient to prevent mispaired mRNA double-strand formation in the cold. It remains to be seen, however, which role the preferential binding of CSP to uracil-rich sequences may have in this context. In addition to the presumed RNA chaperone activity there is good evidence that some E. coli CSP function as transcriptional antiterminators of coldregulated polycistronic genes [5]. Some post-terminator cistrons have been attributed to cold regulation, and the amount of their mRNA was shown to increase upon either a down-shift in temperature or the overexpression of certain CSP genes [39,40]. Transcription termination occurs at terminator sites on the 3¢-end of a mRNA transcript which contains two inverted, guanine- and cytosine-rich sequence motifs that can form a stem­loop. This stem­loop is followed on the downstream side by five or more uridines. A current model of transcription termination assumes the dissociation of a nascent transcript from the DNA upon stem­loop formation at the terminator site. When the adjacent uracil-rich sequence is being transcribed, the affinity of the dA­U base pairs is insufficient to stabilize the DNA­RNA duplex, and the transcript, together with the RNA polymerase, disassembles from the template. It is expected that the obstruction of stem­loop formation prevents termination and leads to transcription of cistrons on the 3¢ side of termination sites. The ability of the CSP to prevent doublestrand formation in RNA may destabilize terminator stem­loops and promote transcription antitermination [5]. We suggest that the preference of CSP binding for uracil-rich sequences may direct the CSP to terminator sites. Ligand-binding interfaces from CSP and Y-box proteins are highly conserved Remarkably, all side chains involved in ligand binding in the CSPÆdT6 crystal structures are located and oriented almost invariantly in the absence of a ligand (Fig. 8). The nucleotide-binding site of the CSP thus

appears to be a conserved preformed platform, which does not undergo major reorientations upon ligand binding. A similar degree of conservation can also be found in the sequences of CSP homologues from other bacteria (Fig. 9). Individual amino acids aligned to residues from the binding interface are conserved at a level of at least 75% similarity, whereas amino acids aligned with residues from other surface areas do not show a similar degree of conservation. This suggests that binding modes and preferences of homologous CSP in bacteria are very similar and may be attributed to the same function, a finding that has already been demonstrated for the CSP paralogues of B. subtilis and E. coli [3,41]. Apart from eubacteria, proteins with CSD can also be found in eukaryotic proteins. A high degree of sequence identity (> 45%) was reported between the CSP and the nucleic acid-binding domains of the eukaryotic Y-box factors [10]. Y-Box proteins have been implicated in transcriptional activation and repression, regulation of alternative splicing, regulation of mRNA stability, translational activation or repression and RNA packaging. It was also shown recently that a Y-box protein was required for growth of cultured avian cells at low temperatures [42]. Most residues involved in preferential ligand binding in the two CSPÆdT6 crystal structures can also be found in the sequences of Y-box proteins, with the exception of side chains forming nucleobasebinding subsites 1 and 2 (Fig. 9B). We therefore expect that the Y-box proteins and the CSP not only have a common ancestor but also share a closely similar DNA-binding mode.

Experimental procedures
Data collection and processing
Bc-Csp was purified, and the Bc-CspÆdT6 complex was formed and crystallized as previously described [43]. A crystal was frozen in liquid nitrogen, and X-ray diffrac° tion data were collected at a wavelength of 0.9184 A at the Protein Structure Factory beamline BL 14.1 [44] of the Free University of Berlin at BESSY (Berlin, Germany) using a MAR165 CCD camera. A complete data ° set was collected to a maximal resolution of 1.29 A. The xds package [45] was used to integrate reflection intensities. The quality of the data set is summarized in Table 1. The Bc-CspÆdT6 complex crystallized in space group ° P21212 with unit cell parameters of a ¼ 74.34 A, b ¼ ° , c ¼ 31.20 A. Two protein and two DNA mole° 64.89 A cules were found per asymmetric unit. The solvent content was 39%.

Fig. 9. The ligand-binding surfaces of CSP and Y-box proteins are highly conserved. (A) CSP sequence conservation mapped to the surface of Bc-Csp bound to dT6. Most residues forming the ligand interaction site are conserved on the level of at least 75% identity (dark green) and similarity (light green). Invariant regions which originate from the protein backbone are coloured light blue. The monomeric structure shown in this figure represents a globular unit from a swapped Bc-Csp dimer. The model of heptanucleotide ligand (sticks) was assembled by combining structural information of the Bs-CspBÆdT6 and Bc-CspÆdT6 complex structures. (B) Sequence alignment of CSP (upper) and Ybox proteins (lower). Residues which are conserved at a level of at least 75% identity or similarity are highlighted in black or grey, respectively. Side chains involved in DNA binding in the Bc-Csp crystal structure are marked by triangles (blue ¼ polar contacts, yellow ¼ hydrophobic contacts, green ¼ both).

Structure determination, model building and refinement
The phase problem could be solved via molecular replacement using amore software [46] and free Bc-Csp (1C9O) as a template. The structure was refined using refmac5 [47] version 5.1.24. Five per cent of the reflections were set aside for cross-validation, and Rfree was used to adjust the refinement strategy and monitor progress. After some initial steps

of rigid-body, positional and B-factor refinement, negative Fo ) Fc difference density indicated an alternative progression of the backbone around residues 35­38. Additional positive Fo ) Fc density revealed the ligand molecules. The model was progressively extended according to difference density. Two hundred and thirty-six water molecules were added using both automated methods [48] and manual inspection of difference maps. The refinement converged at Rfree and Rwork values of 13.0 and 16.2%, respectively. The

The level of conservation was calculated for each sequence position and shaded at a level of 75% sequence identity (black) or similarity (grey) using bioedit (Ibis Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Fluorescence titration of Bc-Csp variants with oligonucleotides
Fluorescence of Trp8 from Bc-Csp was measured using a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorimeter (JASCO Ltd., Great Dunmow, UK) equipped with a thermostat cell holder attached to a water bath. All experiments were carried out at 15 °C in 50 mm cacodylate / HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0, supplemented with 40 nm N-acetyl-tryptophan-amide. To determine dissociation constants, a 20 nm protein solution was titrated with increasing amounts of oligonucleotide in the range 0.25 nm to 20 lm depending on complex affinity. The samples were stirred gently during titration. After 2 min of equilibration, the fluorescence of Trp8 was excited at 280 nm and measured at 343 nm. The initial sample volume was 1.75 mL and the increase in volume after successive addition of highly concentrated oligonucleotide solution was below 4%. The fluorescence was corrected for inner-filter effects, buffer fluorescence, oligonucleotide autofluorescence and dilution. The changes in the fluorescence reveal binding isotherms, which were analysed according to the binding equation [49,50]: Q ¼ Qmax Á with A ¼ KD þ ½P0 þ n Á ½N0 where Q is the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of Trp8 after each addition of oligonucleotide. Qmax represents the maximal quenching upon complete saturation of the protein with ssDNA. [P]0 and [Y]0 are the overall Bc-Csp and oligonucleotide concentration, respectively. n is the number of oligonucleotide strands bound to one Bc-Csp molecule, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex. The binding model does not take the degeneracy of multiple binding sites within one singlestrand DNA into account and therefore the obtained results represent apparent equilibrium constants.

Alignment of CSD sequences
A BLAST search was performed to find homologous sequences to Bc-Csp. The closest 250 hits were aligned and used to define a profile, which was trained by two further cycles of searching / alignment. The 250 hits reported after the fourth search cycle were used for a multiple sequence alignment. Thirteen sequences with the highest degree of divergence from the profile were added to the sequences of Bc-Csp and Bs-CspB and arranged for display in Fig. 9B.
