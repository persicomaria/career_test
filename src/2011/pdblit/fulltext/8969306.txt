Abstract The conformation of a-conotoxin MI, a potent antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, has been investigated in aqueous solution. Two-dimensional NMR experiments and simulated annealing calculations provide the overall topology of a-conotoxin MI; then molecular dynamics simulation with the explicit solvent water was followed in order to obtain a more reliable solution structure. The resulting conformation indicates the presence of a 310 helix and a type I b-turn for residues Pro6≠Cys8 and Gly9≠Try12, respectively, and shows a significant structural similarity to that of a-conotoxin GI, which has biological activity similar to that of MI. The present study provides a molecular basis for the a-conotoxin≠receptor interaction. q 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

investigate the nervous system at the molecular level. These neurotoxins have been found to exist in many animals, plants and microorganisms, and marine snails, in particular, are known to produce a series of interesting toxic peptides named conotoxins. The fishhunting snails Conus magus and Conus geographus produce more than 40 species of conotoxins w1≠4x, which have been divided into three main groups according to their activity: Zi. a-conotoxins, which inhibit the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Z nAChR. at the neuromuscular junctions, Z ii. v-conotoxins, which prevent the entry of calcium ions into the nerve terminals, and Ziii. m-conotoxins, which block the sodium ion channel of muscle tissue w5x.

the three major classes, a-conotoxins include the smallest ones consisting of 13≠15 amino acid residues, which have a nearly conserved core sequence Cys≠Cys≠ Z AsnrHis. ≠Pro≠Ala≠Cys≠Gly≠ X≠X≠ ZTyrrPhe. ≠X≠Cys. The small size of the toxins would be very important in the field of drug design. a-Conotoxin MI from Conus magus w2x and GI from Conus geographus w1x, which have this conserved sequence, have been most widely used in order to study the molecular basis of the nAChR w6≠8x. The conformation of a-conotoxin GI has been studied with various methods. Hider has proposed a model with a 50% a-helical structure that was derived from circular dichroism Z CD. data and the Chou≠Fasman prediction method w9x. Gray et al. have also constructed a model for the tertiary structure of a-conotoxin GI by the Chou≠Fasman method and the rearrangement of the backbone for a best fit with the active clip of erabutoxin b w10x. The NMR studies of a-conotoxin GI in DMSO-d 6 w11x and in aqueous solution w12x provided its overall fold, but the resulting structures did not show an obvious structural feature. The recently reported high resolution X-ray structure of a-conotoxin GI has indicated the presence of a 310 helix and a type I b-turn w13x, which was compatible with the previous result obtained by the CD experiment. Although the conformation of a-conotoxin GI has been discussed by comparison with a series of alkaloids w11,12x, which are known to bind to the nAChR, it is necessary to determine the solution structures of other a-conotoxins in order to obtain a common structural motif and further study the mode of the interaction between a-conotoxins and nAChR. In the present study, we report the solution structure of a-conotoxin MI. Two-dimensional NMR experiments and standard simulated annealing calculations have been attempted in order to determine the overall topology of a-conotoxin MI. Then, the refinement procedure was followed using molecular dynamics simulation with the explicit solvent water w14≠17x, which could be expected to provide a detailed solution structure. The resulting structure is compared with that of a-conotoxin GI obtained by the X-ray crystallography, and the structure≠activity relationship will be discussed.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials a-Conotoxin MI was synthesized as described previously w18x. 2.2. NMR experiments and simulated annealing calculations 90% H 2 Or10% D 2 O and D 2 O were used as the solvents. The sample solution was adjusted to pH 4.1 by the addition of HCl and NaOH. The NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL GSX-500 and a Varian Unity 500plus at 58C. For spectral assignment and extraction of structural information, DQF-COSY w19x, TOCSY w20x, NOESY w21x, ROESY w22x and P.E.COSY w23x experiments were performed in the phase-sensitive mode w24x. The TOCSY spectra were recorded with the mixing times of 40 and 80 msec. The NOESY spectra were obtained with the mixing times of 100 and 150 msec. Measurement of 3 J ZHC a-Cb-H. was carried out on a P.E.COSY spectrum recorded in D 2 O. All data processing was performed using Felix ZBiosym Technology. . Chemical shifts were referenced with respect to H 2 O, which in turn was calibrated using an internal standard, 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate Z DSS. . Intensities of NOE peaks proportional to the mixing time were obtained from ROESY and NOESY spectra. Distance constraints were classified as 1.8≠ ∞ 2.5, 1.8≠3.0, 1.8≠4.0 and 1.8≠5.0 A according to their cross peak intensities. The stereospecific assignments of methylene groups were made from an analysis of the P.E.COSY and NOESY spectra, and two x 1 dihedral angle restraints were employed. The standard simulated annealing protocols were performed in order to calculate structures with the X-PLOR program w25x on an IRIS Indigo 2 Extreme. From among the resulting structures with no violation of NMR-derived constraints, one with the lowest total energy was used as an initial structure for the succeeding molecular dynamics simulation. 2.3. Molecular dynamics simulation with the explicit sol’ent water The following calculations were performed with AMBER version 4.1 w26x and its all-atom force field

w27x on a SPARC station 10. The above initial structure was solvated by 2517 TIP3P waters in a rectang u la r b o x w h o s e d im e n s io n s w e r e ∞ 48.2 = 45.0 = 40.1 A. After the whole system was minimized until the RMS value of the potential gradi∞ ent was below 0.5 kcal moly1 Ay1, 10 ps of MD on the solvent only was performed. This was followed by the second energy minimization until the RMS value of the potential gradient was below ∞ 0.05 kcal moly1 Ay1. Two 3 ps of MD at 100 and 200 K were then performed, followed by 194 ps Z total 200 ps. of MD at 300 K with the NMR-derived constraints. Simulations were run with SHAKE, a 1 fs time step, and constant pressure. A cut-off radius of ∞ 9 A for the van der Waals and electrostatic interac∞ tions was applied. The interactions up to 14 A were only calculated at every 10 steps, when the pair list was updated. The potential energy term was quadratic for the distance and dihedral angle violations smaller ∞ than 3 A and 308, respectively, and was linear beyond these values. T he force constants w ere ∞ 10 kcal moly1 Ay2 and 50 kcal moly1 rady2 for distance and dihedral angle constraints, respectively. The coordinates were recorded at every 100 steps for the last 190 ps. The computed structures were visualized and analyzed with the program QUANTA on an IRIS Indigo 2 computer.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations H-NMR spectrum of a-conotoxin MI in aqueous solution showed the presence of some conformers, composed of a major one with a high population larger than 80% and some relatively minor ones. No exchange cross peaks were detected between major and minor forms in NOESY spectra. The conformational exchange between these isomers should be slow. These phenomena had been also observed in the high-performance liquid chromatogram reported by Gray et al. w28x. The signals derived from the major conformer were readily differentiated and used for further structural determination. The details of the isomerization are under investigation. The sequence-specific resonance assignments of the major conformer of a-conotoxin MI are summarized in Table 1. Eleven intraresidual, 22 sequential, 5 medium-range, and 8 long-range NOEs were detected and converted to the distance constraints. On the basis of the 3 J ZH-Ca-Cb-H. coupling constants and the intensities of intraresidual NOEs, we established the stereospecific assignments of the prochiral b-methylene protons and the range of the x 1 sidechain torsion angles for Cys3 and Cys8.

NMR experimental constraints, which consisted of 46 distance constraints and 2 torsion angle constraints, were used for the following simulated annealing calculations. A set of 100 individual structures was calculated on the basis of the NMR-derived constraints using standard simulated annealing protocols in X-PLOR. These calculations provide 10 structures which have ∞ no distance violations greater than 0.2 A and no dihedral angle violations greater than 58. The pair∞ wise atomic RMS deviation was 1.18 A for backbone heavy atoms, which was much smaller than those reported in the previous NMR studies of a-conotoxin GI w11,12x. The structures obtained from the simulated annealing calculations with regard to the major conformation of a-conotoxin MI converged to almost a same overall fold and suggested the presence of two tight turns, but detailed structural features were not obtained from the resulting structures. 3.2. Solution structure of a-conotoxin MI deri’ed from molecular dynamics simulation with the explicit sol’ent water In order to elucidate the detailed characteristics of the major conformation of a-conotoxin MI, an MD simulation with the explicit solvent water was performed, which has been widely used in order to study more reliable solution structures of proteins and DNAs w14≠17x. Although an electrostatic interaction is not included in the standard simulated annealing protocols of X-PLOR in order to reduce artifacts due to excessive charge≠charge interactions, this simulation can be carried out using a full molecular force field. Therefore, the hydrogen bonding interactions in solution could be deduced from the MD simulation with the explicit solvent water. We added potential functions for the NMR-derived constraints to the standard AMBER potential functions in order to make the trajectory satisfy these experimental data more closely ZSection 2.. Fig. 1 shows the time evolution of the RMS deviation between the initial structure and the trajectory structures recorded every 0.1 ps in the MD simulation. After about 100 ps, this simulation converged to a structure with average RMS deviations of ∞ 1.40 " 0.07 A from the initial structure and ∞ from the average structure over 100 to 0.48 " 0.01 A

200 ps for the backbone atoms excluding the N-terminal two residues, which were found to be fluctuating. The average distance and dihedral violations from NMR-derived constraints over 100 to 200 ps were ∞ 0.054 " 0.020 A and 0.13 " 0.638, respectively, which indicates that the MD simulation satisfies the constraints well. Therefore, the conformational and hydrogen bond analysis were performed over 100 to 200 ps. The distribution of the f , c angles over 100 to 200 ps and their Ramachandran plot are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. These results clearly

indicate that a well-defined backbone conformation was obtained in the MD simulation except for the N-terminal two residues, and the average f , c angles fall in a generally allowed region. Interestingly, the backbone dihedral angles of Gly9 are located in the region where only a glycine residue can exist. The hydrogen bond analysis over 100 to 200 ps was also performed with the criteria of the distance be∞ tween N and O atoms of less than 4 A and the angle

H≠N≠O less than 408. It was found that there are four hydrogen bonds above a 90% possibility, i.e. CO ZHis5. ≠NH ZCys8. , CO ZPro6. ≠NH Z Gly9. , CO ZCys8. ≠NH ZAsn11., and CO ZSer13. ≠NH ZCys3., and one above a 75% possibility, i.e. CO Z Gly9. ≠NH ZTyr12.. This result also suggests the convergence of the backbone conformation. The mean structure of a-conotoxin MI over 100 to 200 ps are presented in Fig. 4. Its overall structure is compact-folded by two disulfide bonds and a hydrogen bond between the amide group of Cys3 and the carbonyl group of Ser13. The characteristic f , c angles of Pro6, Ala7, and Cys8 locate the 310 helix in this sequence portion, because the typical f , c angles of the 310 helix are Zy608, y308.. This was further supported by the presence of i TM i q 3 hydrogen bonds, CO Z His5. ≠ NH ZCys8., and CO ZPro6. ≠NH ZGly9., as shown in Fig. 4. The backbone conformation for residues Gly9≠Tyr12 is described as a type I b-turn, because the f , c angles of the middle two residues, Lys10 and Asn11, are nearly similar to those for the typical type I b-turn, i.e. Z y608, y308. and Z y908, 08., respectively. This also suggested the presence of an i TM i q 3 hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly9 and the amide nitrogen of Tyr12. The location of the 310 helix and b-turn nearly agrees with the model proposed by Gray et al. w10x.

Fig. 5. Distribution of the RMS difference of all heavy atoms over 100≠200 ps about the mean structure as a function of the residue number.

Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the RMS difference of all heavy atoms for the trajectory structures about the mean structure as a function of the residue number. The conformation of the side-chains of Cys3, Cys4, Pro6, Ala7, Cys8, Tyr12, Ser13, and Cys14, which include the conserved residues for a-conotoxins, were well defined in the MD simulation. The two tight disulfide bonds appear to play an important role in the formation and stabilization of the globular structure of a-conotoxin MI. The disulfide bond between Cys3 and Cys8 interconnects the N-terminal and the end of the 310-helix, while that between Cys4 and Cys14 connects the beginning of the 310-helix with the C-terminal. Thus, the side-chain of Tyr12 near the C-terminal could form a hydrophobic cluster with Pro6, as shown in Fig. 4. The N-terminal glycine residue Z Gly1. and the side-chains of the hydrophilic residues, Arg2, His5, Lys10, and Asn11, were found to be fluctuating ZFig. 5. . 3.3. Structure≠acti’ity relationships for a-conotoxins. As described above, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a-conotoxin MI, a potent nAChR antagonist, by NMR spectroscopy combined with simulated annealing calculations and MD simulation. The high resolution X-ray structure of a-conotoxin GI, which possesses a pharmacological activity similar to that of MI, has been also reported

w13x. Fig. 6 provides the sequence alignment of aconotoxins MI, GI, and SI from Conus striatus w29x. Below, we discuss the structure≠activity relationships of the a-conotoxins, together with the comparison of the structural characteristics between MI and GI. In Fig. 7, the mean structure of a-conotoxin MI over 100≠200 ps is compared with that of GI determined by X-ray analysis. The RMS deviation be∞ tween the two structures is 1.14 A for the backbone atoms. The X-ray structure of a-conotoxin GI shows the presence of a 310 helix for residues Pro5≠Cys7 and a type I b-turn or a distorted 310 helix for residues Gly8≠Tyr11. As described above, these secondary structures were also observed for the corresponding residues in a-conotoxin MI. These results obviously indicate that the two toxins exhibit a common molecular folding, as shown in Fig. 7. This conformational similarity could explain that the CD spectrum of a-conotoxins MI and GI are almost identical w9,28x. Because their profiles of neurotoxic activities are almost identical, it could be assumed that such a consensus of molecular folding is essential for the binding of antagonists to receptor sites. Interestingly, a glycine residue ZGly8. of a-conotoxin GI has the f , c angles of Z54.38, y124.48., which are located in the region not allowed for other residues as well as the case of Gly9 of MI. Therefore, these glycine residues could be expected to play an important role in the globular molecular folding of the two toxins. This result is strongly supported by the previous functional studies with the synthetic conotoxin MI analogues w30x. The substitution of Gly9 for Ala drastically reduced the neurotoxic potency to only 3% of that of the parent compound. In view of the spatial arrangements of the functional groups, the two toxins exhibit a hydrophobic region formed by Pro, Ala, and Tyr, clustered on one edge of the toxin molecule, as shown in Fig. 7. This region could be expected to contribute to the binding of a toxin molecule to the nAChR. Other possible

This is the result of the best-fit superposition of the backbone atoms for the corresponding residues of the two conotoxins.

determinants that confer toxin≠receptor interactions were suggested by comparing the charge distribution of a-conotoxins. Under physiological conditions, aconotoxin MI has net charges of q3 due to the N-terminal amide, Arg2, and Lys10, whereas the total charge of GI is q1 because the acidic residue Glu1 eliminates one of two positive charges of the N-terminal amide and Arg9 ZFig. 6.. Despite these different properties of the molecular surface, the two toxins also exhibit two cations in almost the same spatial arrangements ZFig. 7.. These correspond to the N-terminal amide and Lys10 for a-conotoxin MI, and the N-terminal amide and Arg9 for GI. This structural characteristic could also be expected to play an important role in the binding to a receptor. The recent study using muscle type nAChR from the electric organ of Torpedo californica and Torpedo nobiliana revealed that a-conotoxin MI and GI interact with two distinct binding sites on the nAChR with different affinities w31x. The high-affinity site is located at the a≠g-subunit interface and the low affinity one is at the a≠d-subunit interface, although a-conotoxin SI has no selectivity in these two subsites. The a-conotoxin SI has also the conserved core sequence, but a proline residue ZPro9. replaces a lysine Zarginine. residue in MI ZGI., which has the conserved cation for the two conotoxins, and the sequence position of a lysine residue ZLys10. in a-conotoxin SI corresponds to a histidine Z asparagine. residue in MI ZGI. ZFig. 6.. Although the solution structure of a-conotoxin SI remains to be

established, it could be presumed that the spatial arrangement of cations might be different between a-conotoxins MI ZGI. and SI. The spatial arrangement of cations exhibited by a-conotoxin MI ZGI. might contribute to the selectivity observed between the two subsites on the nAChR. We have described here in detail the three-dimensional structure of a-conotoxin MI, in terms of a common structural topology with GI and the structure≠activity relationships of a-conotoxins. This study could contribute to our better understanding of the toxin blockade mechanisms and be useful in designing synthetic antagonists or agonists with high selectivity for the different subsites of the nAChR.
