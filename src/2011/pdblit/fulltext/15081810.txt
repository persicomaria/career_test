Abstract Molecular modelling was used to investigate the catalytic site of penicillin G acylase (PGA) by building up a simple enzyme ≠ ligand model able to describe and predict the enzyme selectivity. The investigation was based on a double computational approach: first, the GRID computational procedure was applied to gain a qualitative description of the chemical features of the PGA active site; second, a classical ``transition state approach'' was used to simulate the tetrahedral intermediates and to evaluate their energies. GRID calculations employed different probes which gave a complete description of the chemical interactions occurring upon binding of different ligands, thus indicating those structures having good affinity with the active site of the enzyme. Tetrahedral intermediates were constructed on the basis of GRID results and provided both geometrical features and energies of enzyme ≠ substrate interaction. Such energies were compared to experimental kinetic data obtained in the enzymatic acylation of L-phenylglycine methyl ester using various methyl phenylacetate derivatives. The good agreement of computational results with experimental evidence demonstrates the validity of the model as a rapid and flexible tool to describe and predict the enzyme selectivity.

1. Introduction Penicillin G acylase (PGA) is an important enzyme used for industrial production of 6-APA by hydrolysis of penicillin G. Moreover, the substrate- and stereo-selectivity of the enzyme has been widely employed, in aqueous media, in protection/deprotection of functional groups as well as for the resolution of drug precursors [1≠ 3]. In recent years, our group has demonstrated that PGA is highly active in organic solvent, so that it can be fully exploited also in the synthetic route, with remarkably advantages [4≠ 7]. The structure of PGA is well known and many crystallographic structures are accessible [8≠ 10]. The crystal structure of PGA from E. coli characterised by the best resolution ∞ (1.90 A) was determined by Duggleby et al. [8] in 1995 (PBD ID: 1pnk).

An extensive crystallographic study of the noncovalent binding of PGA with a series of phenylacetic acid derivatives, supported by an experimental evaluation of inhibition constants, was carried out by Done et al. [9]. Other contributions to the understanding of the structure of this enzyme have come from the crystal structures of PGA from a mutant of P. rettgeri [11] and of a slowly processing precursor mutant of PGA [12]. The catalytic site of PGA is characterised by an acylic subsite that accommodates the aromatic ring of phenylacetic acid, and an aminic subsite interacting with the amine residue. However, to the best of our knowledge, no molecular modelling studies of covalent tetrahedral intermediate species involved in the PGA hydrolysis/acylation reactions have been reported so far. In order to find a rationale for the observed PGA selectivity, a computational study of PGA is presented in this paper. The catalytic site of PGA was firstly explored with the GRID program. Although this computational method has

The GRID approach provided guidelines to rationally select substrate structures from which tetrahedral intermediates were derived and evaluated in terms of energy and geometry.

method, using a distance dependent dielectric constant (er = 4.5). This value of the dielectric constant mimics an apolar medium like toluene and allows to obtain a structure similar to the crystallographic one without using explicit solvent molecules [17]. 2.5. Models for tetrahedral intermediates All tetrahedral intermediates were built up by bonding the reactive carbonyl carbon of the phenylacetic residue to the Og of the serine residue (Ser B:1) and to the amino group of the L-PhGlyOMe. As a result, the carbonyl carbon atom changes to tetrahedral sp3-hybridized. The partial charges of the tetrahedral intermediate and the structural features of tetrahedral carbon and of nitro group, non-parameterised by the AMBER force field, were calculated by an ab initio calculation with 6-31G** basis set (Spartan). Bond lengths and angles on tetrahedral carbon and nitro group were then constrained in the position calculated by Spartan. 2.6. Molecular dynamics Molecular dynamics calculations were carried out on each of the tetrahedral intermediates. The simulation proceeded by a brief relaxation for a period of 3 ps. Then, 10 cycles of a simulated annealing were performed on the complex by heating and cooling it from 700 to 0 K for a time period of 10 ps. All dynamic simulations were performed on the same model described in the force field paragraph. 2.7. Materials PGA-450 was a generous gift of Roche (Mannheim, Germany). It consists of PGA from E. coli covalently immobilised on a polymer, the chemical nature of which is not disclosed by the producer. PGA-450 has a water content of 62.3% and it was partially dehydrated before use with the aid of CeliteR R-640 (Fluka) according to a procedure reported [18], obtaining a preparation with an activity of 401 U¡g¿ 1. Toluene used in enzymatic reactions ∞ was dried over molecular sieves (4 A). Reagents (methyl phenylacetate, methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and methyl phenoxyacetate) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich-Fluka and used without further purification. Chemical synthesis of all other esters and preparation of L-PhGlyOMe free base were performed as previously reported [5,7]. The determination of water activity and the assay of PGA activity in water were done according to a procedure previously described [19]. 2.8.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Molecular modelling equipment All calculations were performed on Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. The manipulations of molecules, the graphic evaluation, the energy minimisations and the dynamic simulations were performed using the molecular modelling program-package SYBYL 6.6 (distributed by Tripos Ass., St. Louis, Missouri). GRID computations were performed with GRID program version 19 (distributed by Molecular Discovery Ltd, London, UK). Quantum mechanical computations were performed by Spartan 4.1.2 (distributed by Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, California). 2.2. Structures of PGA For all calculations, the X-ray crystal structure of the PGA from E. coli (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank [15] entry number 1pnk [8]) was used. The crystal structures with PDB ID: 1ai6 and 1ajn [9] were used for the coordinates of substrates bond in the active site. All `stable' ∞ water molecules, on the basis of their h-factor ( < 50 A2) in the crystal structures, were included in the calculations and the hydrogen positions were calculated using the Biopolymer module of SYBYL. 2.3. GRID For GRID calculations, the grid size was chosen in order to enclose completely the active site of PGA, resulting in ∞ ∞ 27 ¬ 27 ¬ 24 A, with a grid spacing of 1 A. Interaction energies reported in Table 1 were calculated, and the analysis of MIFs was performed by GVIEW program, enclosed in the GRID 19 package, and by exporting the MIFs into SYBYL, after conversion into the Tripos ``contour'' format. 2.4. Force field parameters For all energy minimisations and dynamics simulations, the AMBER `all-atom' force field [16], in its SYBYL implementation, has been used. Only amino acid residues ∞ within a 10 A distance from Og of Ser B:1, and all the stable structures which are included at least partially inside the 10 ∞ A radius sphere, were considered during the minimisations. The minimisations were performed by means of the Powell

with 62.5 mg of PGA-450 and incubated in a thermostatted orbital shaker at 30 jC. After complete conversion, amides were isolated simply by evaporating the solvents, since no side products are formed during the reactions. The reaction course (initial rate, v0) was followed by withdrawing samples from the supernatant and analysing them by RP-HPLC (Pharmacia) using a C-18 Chrompack column. Isocratic elution: acetonitrile/water = 50:50 and 0.025% TFA, flow = 1 ml/min. Detector: UV ≠visible spectrophotometer at kmax = 260nm. Amides were characterised by 1H and 13C NMR.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Analysis of the catalytic site using the GRID program GRID is a computational procedure for detecting energetically favourable binding sites on molecules of known three-dimensional structure which was developed by Good-

ford in 1985. This tool allows estimation of the interaction energies between small chemical groups (probes) and a target (in this case the catalytic site of PGA) [20 ≠ 22]. The catalytic site of PGA was explored with the GRID program by establishing a regular array of grid points throughout and around the catalytic site of the enzyme (Fig. 1). The interaction energies between the target and the probes were calculated for each grid node. A node distance ∞ (grid spacing) of 1 A gives a reasonable accuracy/computational time ratio. Decreasing the grid spacing to less than 1 ∞ A does not result in higher precision, while it increases significantly the calculation time [14]. The GRID probes were chosen to cover all relevant physico-chemical interactions (hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding) which can be established between a hypothetical substrate and the functional groups of the catalytic site of PGA, and Table 1 reports the probes used in the calculations together with a schematic description of their interactions with the catalytic site.

3.2. Acylic subsite The GRID analysis of the acylic subsite, with two hydrophobic probes (one aromatic and one aliphatic, see Table 1), resulted in particularly strong interactions. Hydrophobic interactions (usually ¿0.2 to ¿1.0 kcal¡mol¿ 1) attain an atypical high value of ¿ 3 kcal¡mol¿ 1 in this part of the catalytic site. Both the aromatic and the aliphatic carbon probes generated a characteristically flat molecular interaction field (MIF). The flat surface (Fig. 2) indicates a restricted conformational freedom and it is more consistent

with a phenyl residue than with an alkyl chain. This is in agreement with the high selectivity of PGA towards phenylacetic derivatives and poor reactivity of aliphatic acyl groups reported before [23]. Calculations with four different hydrogen bond donor probes (Table 1) resulted in MIFs that are spatially close to and on the same plane of the flat hydrophobic MIF and mainly due to interactions with Ser B:67 and, to a less extent, with Met A:140 and Ser B:1. As a matter of fact, the superimposition of surfaces generated by the H-bond donor and hydrophobic probes predicts that the acylic subsite undergoes strong interactions with hydroxy substituted phenyl ring in general. This is in agreement with the experimental evidences that reported a good reactivity of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic derivatives [7,24]. The use of the nitro oxygen probe resulted in a strong MIF ( ¿ 5 kcal¡mol¿ 1). However, the nitro group, when present as a substituent on a phenyl ring, lays out of the corresponding MIF because the corresponding nitro and hydrophobic-MIFs are partially overlapped, thus suggesting that nitro-substituted phenyl rings are poorly recognised by PGA (Fig. 3). The mapping of the acylic subsite with halogen probes, especially bromine and chlorine, resulted in MIFs characterised by strong energies. In fact, it has been reported that methyl chloroacetate is well accepted in the PGA catalysed acylation of 7-ACA [25]. However, even more manifestly than in the case of the nitro group, the superimposition between surfaces generated by halogen and hydrophobic probes excludes the possibility to insert halogen-substituted phenyl rings in the acylic cleft. As shown in Table 1, the H-bond acceptor probes are not relevant for the description of the acylic subsite, while they strongly interact with the oxanionic hole (Ala B:69 and Asn

structural variability of amines accepted by PGA if compared with the strictly aromatic specificity of the acylic subsite. This part of the catalytic site is characterised by the presence of several hydrophobic amino acids (Phe A:146, Phe B:71, Ala B:69, Leu B:253, Phe B:256, Gly B:385) so that hydrophobic probes generated strong MIFs (Fig. 4). The energy levels observed (less than 1 kcal¡mol¿ 1) using the hydrophobic probes indicate that the aminic subsite can recognize aromatic rings and hydrophobic structures in general, although with a less marked specificity than the acylic subsite (Table 1). The MIF generated by the carbonyl oxygen probe (Fig. 4) showed that carbonyl groups can interact with Arg B:263, Asn B:388 and Ser B:386. However, as shown in Table 1, all polar probes (H-bond donor and nitro oxygen probes) undergo strong interactions in this part of the subsite.

3.4. Construction of transition state models The GRID analysis gave detailed information on specific structural requirements in terms of hydrophobic and polar interactions occurring inside the active site and also indicated that the acylic cleft is by far more selective than the aminic pocket. These geometrical hints were then used to construct tetrahedral intermediate models on a rational basis, and the investigation was focused on the acylic pocket, due to its higher selectivity. It has been reported that for serine proteases [26, 27] and N-terminal serine hydrolases [8] (such as PGA) the tetrahedral intermediate can be considered the chemical species most closely related to the transition state of the rate determining step of the reaction. The minimum energy conformation of the tetrahedral intermediates in the binding site of PGA was evaluated for

B:241) which is crucial for the stabilisation of the transition state. 3.3. Aminic subsite The aminic site of PGA is poorly described in the literature and only a noncovalent complex between PGA and benzylpenicillin has been reported so far [10]. The larger ∞ size of the aminic hole (volume of f 1000 A3), compared to ∞ 3), allows for a higher the acylic pocket (volume of f 300 A conformational freedom of the amine ligand, taken into account that the rotational spheroid generated by a phenyl ∞ ring has a volume of about 65 A3. This can explain the wide

different phenylacetic acid derivatives and L-PhGlyOMe (see Table 2 and Scheme 1) by molecular modelling simulations. The PGA portion taken into account in the computations can be described as a flattened spheroid with a radius of ∞ about 10 A, centred on the Og of Ser B:1, which includes also all the stable secondary structures at least partially inside this radius. The position of the acyl donors inside the active site was defined from the crystallographic data available on complexes between PGA and different phenylacetic acid derivatives (phenylacetic, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic and 4nitrophenylacetic acids; PDB ID: 1pnl [8], 1ai6 and 1ajn [9], respectively). GRID analysis and molecular dynamics simulations allowed to position the amine residue in the active site. The covalent tetrahedral intermediates were minimised and their energy evaluated. The interaction energy was calculated from the difference between the energy of the

tetrahedral intermediate and of the isolated substrates and enzyme (Eq. (1) and Table 2): DE º Etetrahedral ¿ Eacyl donor ˛ Eneucleophile ˛ Eenzyme ﬁ 1ﬁ

The energy values were calculated using a distance dependent dielectric constant of an apolar medium (see Section 2.4). The position analysis of the different tetrahedral intermediates inside the active site pointed out a favourable setting for the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate moiety, with respect to the unsubstituted compound inside the acylic cleft (Fig. 5 and energy data in Table 2). GRID computations indicate that the phenyl ring of phenylacetic derivatives undergoes strong interactions with the hydrophobic environment and, in addition, the force field energy calculation indicates a hydrogen bond between the hydroxy group in 4-position and the Ser B:67. The formation of the H-bond stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate of about 4

kcal¡mol¿ 1 (Tables 1 and 2) and it also contributes to orientate the molecule for the nucleophilic attack by serine. Phenyl rings substituted either in 2- or 3-position with the hydroxy group are also expected to be good substrates for the enzyme as indicated by GRID calculations (Fig. 5). However, for these compounds the phenyl ring slightly

shifts from its position of best interaction, so that the energetic contribution of the hydrogen bond with Og of Ser B:1 is lost and the corresponding tetrahedral intermediates have energies that are comparable to that of the unsubstituted substrate (Table 2). As far as the phenoxyacetic derivative is concerned, the presence of an extra oxygen atom in the aliphatic chain causes a substantial shift of the phenyl ring (Fig. 6, Table 2). The nitro group of the 4-nitrophenylacetic derivative is located in an energetically unfavoured position and this is due to electrostatic repulsion with the hydroxy group of Ser B:67. Although GRID calculations had identified a good interaction zone for the nitro oxygen (Fig. 3), the tetrahedral intermediate of the 4-nitrophenylacetic acid derivative is strongly destabilised since the presence of the nitro group ∞ would force a shift of the phenylacetic group of about 2.5 A out of the pocket, but the covalent bond with Ser B:1 keeps it in this unfavourable position. Finally, the presence of a nitro group either in the 3- or 2-position causes severe steric hindrance with the acylic cleft. As far as the aminic subsite is concerned, the tetrahedral intermediate indicates that the conformation of the amine (LPhGlyOMe) is in agreement with GRID calculations. The phenyl ring enters the hydrophobic portion of the aminic subsite while the carbonyl oxygen of the ester group points towards Arg B:263 and Ser B:386 (Fig. 7) and establishes H-bonds with them.

3.5. Experimental validation of the GRID/tetrahedral intermediate model A set of experiments was carried out to verify the accuracy of the computational model. The acylation of L-PhGlyOMe was investigated in toluene using the different phenylacetic derivatives listed in Table 2. Initial rates (v0) and conversions at 24 h were evaluated. Most of the reactions led to the complete acylation of L-PhGlyOMe within 24 h. Only in the case of the 2-nitrophenylacetic derivative no reaction was observed, whereas the 3-nitro and 4-nitrophenylacetic derivatives gave 22% and 70% conversion in 24 h, respectively (Table 2). The comparison of the computational results with the experimental data, summarised in Fig. 8, points out a good agreement with the calculated energies and this demonstrates that our model can be used as a rapid tool to predict the enzyme selectivity, despite the simplifications assumed in the model. An important assumption is the treatment of the solvent by using a distance dependent dielectric constant that mimics an apolar medium. A detailed solvation simulation is particularly relevant in the case of solvents that undergo strong polar interactions. In the present study the lack of explicit solvent molecules is justified since the synthetic reactions were carried out in toluene. Despite the complexity of the experimental system, the model gives good evidence that the formation of the covalent intermediate between PGA and the two reagents is still the rate determining step. The reactivity of the different acyl donors is also in agreement with our previous work [7] and with most of the observations reported in the crystallographic study of Done et al. [9] albeit with few reasonable differences. For instance, the crystal structures of the 4-nitro derivative [9] indicated the shift of the substrate out of the acylic pocket but such a displacement is not allowed when the covalent bond with Ser B:1 of the tetrahedral intermediate has to be formed. Finally, the force field employed in our calculations provided evidence of the formation of a hydrogen bond between the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic derivative and the Ser B:67, whereas previous crystallographic data could not provide conclusive results on this matter.

4. Conclusion Our goal was to design a simple model, able to describe and predict PGA selectivity towards different acyl donors. This novel GRID/tetrahedral intermediate approach, although very simplified, was experimentally validated. Therefore, the choice of disregarding variables, such as precise entropy calculation and detailed solvation conditions, has not compromised the predictiveness of the model, which proved to be a rapid and flexible tool for describing the selectivity of PGA.
