The isoleucyl- and valyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRS and ValRS, respectively) have an editing activity that hydrolyzes incorrect products in a tRNA-dependent manner (Eldred and Schimmel, 1972; Fersht and Kaethner, 1976b; Fersht, 1977, 1985; Freist et al., 1985), while other aaRSs, such as the leucyl-, threonyl-, and alanyl-tRNA synthetases, might also have editing activities to be further characterized (Tsui and Fersht, 1981; Englisch et al., 1986; Freist et al., 1994; Sankaranarayanan et al., 1999, 2000; Cusack et al., 2000). In addition to L-isoleucine, IleRS recognizes and activates L-valine, which is smaller than L-isoleucine by only one methyl group; valyl-adenylate (Val-AMP) is synthesized together with inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), as shown in Equation 1:
IleRS L-valine ATP  IleRS·Val-AMP PPi (1)

Then, IleRS hydrolyzes Val-AMP in a tRNA-dependent reaction:
IleRS·Val-AMP tRNAIle  IleRS AMP tRNAIle L-valine (2)

Summary Valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) strictly discriminates the cognate L-valine from the larger L-isoleucine and the isosteric L-threonine by the tRNA-dependent "double sieve" mechanism. In this study, we deter° mined the 2.9 A crystal structure of a complex of Thermus thermophilus ValRS, tRNAVal, and an analog of the Val-adenylate intermediate. The analog is bound in a pocket, where Pro41 allows accommodation of the Val and Thr moieties but precludes the Ile moiety (the first sieve), on the aminoacylation domain. The editing domain, which hydrolyzes incorrectly synthesized ThrtRNAVal, is bound to the 3 adenosine of tRNAVal. A contiguous pocket was found to accommodate the Thr moiety, but not the Val moiety (the second sieve). Furthermore, another Thr binding pocket for Thr-adenylate hydrolysis was suggested on the editing domain. Introduction High fidelity in protein synthesis is vitally important for all biological systems. The specificity between the amino acid and the codon (the genetic code) critically depends on aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) (Giege et al., ´ 1998). The aminoacylation of tRNA proceeds stepwise: (1) the synthesis of an aminoacyl-adenylate, as an active intermediate, from the amino acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and (2) the transfer of the aminoacyl moiety from the adenylate to the 3 -terminal adenosine (3 -A) of tRNA (Fersht and Kaethner, 1976a). The correct recognition of substrates by aaRSs is essential for the accuracy of translation. However, the affinity difference is not large enough for the enzyme to discriminate

This overall reaction of Equation 2 has been shown to comprise two pathways by kinetic analyses (Fersht, 1977, 1985; Freist et al., 1985) and experiments using a DNA aptamer (Hale and Schimmel, 1996). In the "pretransfer editing" pathway, IleRS complexed with tRNAIle directly hydrolyzes Val-AMP to Val AMP. When ValAMP escapes the pretransfer editing, the Val moiety is transferred once to the 3 -end of tRNAIle, and then the synthesized Val-tRNAIle is hydrolyzed to Val tRNAIle by IleRS (the "posttransfer editing" pathway). In the case of ValRS, the shape and the size of the L-threonine side chain are quite similar to those of L-valine, although one of the methyl groups of L-valine is replaced by a hydroxyl group in L-threonine. ValRS activates this isosteric L-threonine, and forms threonyladenylate (Thr-AMP) in addition to L-valine, as shown in Equation 3:
ValRS L-threonine ATP  ValRS· Thr-AMP PPi (3)

Then, Thr-AMP is eliminated by the ValRS·tRNAVal complex through the "pretransfer" pathway (Equation 4),
tRNAVal·ValRS·Thr-AMP  tRNAVal·ValRS L-Threonine AMP (4)

and the "posttransfer" pathway (Equations 5 and 6),

Fersht (1985) proposed the "double-sieve" (two-step substrate selection) model for the mechanism of the amino-acid selection by IleRS: amino acids larger than L-isoleucine are excluded by the aminoacylation site, serving as the "first, coarse sieve," and smaller ones, such as L-valine, are strictly eliminated by the "second, fine sieve" of the putative "editing site." For ValRS, a model analogous to the "double-sieve" model for the

Figure 1. Schematic Drawing of the "Double-Sieve" Concept for Amino Acid Selection by ValRS

IleRS editing has been proposed (Fersht, 1985): L-threonine and L-valine are recognized by the shape in the first step, and L-threonine is discriminated from L-valine by the presence of the hydroxyl group in the second step (Figure 1). In addition to L-threonine, ValRS also activates and edits L-cysteine (Jakubowski, 1980; Jakubowski and Fersht, 1981) and a noncanonical amino acid, L- -aminobutyrate (Igloi et al., 1977; Fersht and Dingwall, 1979; Jakubowski, 1980), which are smaller than L-valine by one methyl group. The selection mechanism for these two amino acids by ValRS is thought to be similar to that for L-valine by IleRS. Ten aaRSs, including IleRS and ValRS, constitute class I, while the other ten aaRSs constitute class II (Eriani et al., 1990). The class I aaRSs have a Rossmannfold domain in common, to catalyze the synthesis of aminoacyl-adenylate and aminoacyl-tRNA, as represented in the crystal structure of Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) complexed with its cognate tRNAGln (Rould et al., 1989; Rath et al., 1998). The Rossmann-fold aminoacylation domains of IleRS and ValRS have an insertion (the "connective polypeptide" (CP) domain [Nureki et al., 1998; Sugiura et al., 2000]), which was biochemically shown to contain the editing activity to hydrolyze the incorrectly formed aminoacyltRNA (Lin et al., 1996). For IleRS, we have reported the crystal structures of Thermus thermophilus IleRS complexed with L-isoleucine and with L-valine, which substantiated the mechanism of the "double-sieve" amino acid selection (Nureki et al., 1998). Actually, the first sieve, which accommodates both L-isoleucine and L-valine, was identified on the aminoacylation domain, while the second, editing sieve, which is specific to L-valine, was found to exist on the CP domain, which protrudes from the aminoacylation domain (Nureki et al., 1998). As the aminoacylation and editing reactions are carried out in the two distinct catalytic sites, which ° are separated by about 35 A, it remains to be clarified how the valyl moieties of Val-AMP and Val-tRNAIle are transported from the aminoacylation site to the editing site. Recently, Silvian et al. (1999) determined the crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus IleRS complexed with E. coli tRNAIle and the antibiotic mupirocin. They

proposed a shuttling mechanism, in which the valyl moiety of Val-tRNAIle is transferred from the aminoacylation site to the editing site by a simple bending of the 3 -terminal acceptor strand of tRNAIle, analogous to the editing by DNA polymerase. However, in the reported S. aureus IleRS complex structure, the two terminal nucleotides are disordered, due to the lack of interaction between the CCA end and the editing domain (Silvian et al., 1999). Therefore, it is not known how the valylated CCA end is held by the editing domain. Moreover, the structural mechanisms of Val-AMP transport from the aminoacylation site to the distant editing site remain to be elucidated. In contrast to IleRS, the double-sieve mechanism for the discrimination of L-valine from isosteric L-threonine by ValRS has not been elucidated from a structural point of view. In the present study, we have determined the crystal structure of T. thermophilus ValRS complexed with tRNAVal and a Val-AMP analog at ° 2.9 A resolution, and have elucidated how this protein·RNA complex achieves the sophisticated "doublesieve" discrimination of L-valine from L-isoleucine and L-threonine. Results and Discussion Structure Determination Thermus thermophilus ValRS is a monomeric enzyme consisting of 862 amino acid residues. The T. thermophilus tRNAVal isoacceptor with the CAC anticodon consists of 75 nucleotides. An intermediate analog used in this study is N-(L-valyl)-N -adenosyl-diaminosulfone (designated hereafter as Val-AMS). The crystals belong to the space group P42212 with unit cell parameters of a ° ° b 411.8 A, c 81.97 A, and contain one dimeric complex per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) using platinum and gold derivatives. Density modification by solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging improved the electron density map enough for model building. The model of (ValRS·tRNAcVal·Val° AMS)2 was built and refined to 2.9 A resolution with an R-factor of 24.5% (Rfree 27.2%) (Table 1). In the present crystal structure, the C-terminal coiled-coil domains of the two ValRS·tRNAVal·Val-AMS complexes contact each other (data not shown). In this paper, we discuss only one of the two complexes because the two complexes are geometrically almost identical. Domain architecture of the T. thermophilus ValRS is shown in Figure 2. The 3 -end of tRNAVal is bound to the CP-1 domain, as described below. The details of the other specific ValRS·tRNAVal interactions will be described elsewhere. Recognition of the Valyl-Adenylate Analog at the Aminoacylation Site, which Serves as the First Sieve The Val-AMP analog (Val-AMS), in which the ­O­P­O­ linkage between the valyl and ribose moieties is replaced by ­NH­S­NH­, is tightly bound in a deep catalytic cleft of the central Rossmann-fold domain of ValRS (Figure 2). The catalytic cleft of the Rossmann-fold domain serves as the first sieve in the double-sieve substrate selection. First, the -NH3 group of the aminoacyl

moiety of Val-AMS provides three hydrogen bonds with the -CO group of Pro42, the -COO group of Asp81, and the -CO group of Asn44 (Figure 3A). Second, the aliphatic side chain of the valyl moiety fits into a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Pro41, Pro42, Trp456, Ile491, and Trp495 of ValRS (Figure 3A). The -CH group contacts

Figure 2. Overview of the Crystal Structure of the T. thermophilus ValRS·tRNAVal·Val-AMS Ternary Complex The ValRS structure has six major domains: the Rossmann fold (colored in green), the connective polypeptide (CP) domain (CP core, white; CP-1, cyan; CP-2, orange; CP-3, yellow), the "stem-contact (SC)"-fold domain (red), the "anticodon-loop binding" -helix bundle domain (magenta), the "anticodon-stem binding" junction domain (light blue), and the "D and T loops binding" C-terminal coiled-coil domain (light green). Two Zn2 ions (shown as red balls) are bound to the Zn-finger structures, respectively, consistent with the previous biochemical study (Kohda et al., 1984). Val-AMS (shown as a ball and stick model) is bound on the aminoacylation domain. The bound tRNAVal is shown as the backbone worm colored in yellow.

both of the Trp456 and Ile491 side chains: the 1-CH3 group contacts the Pro41 side chain, and the 2-CH3 group contacts the Pro42 and Trp495 side chains (Figure 3B). It is impossible to fit an isoleucyl moiety into this pocket, because there is no room for the additional -CH3 group between the 1-CH2 group and the Pro41 side chain. These seven binding residues are completely conserved among all ValRSs, except that Asn44 is not conserved in the archaeal ValRSs. In the structure of the T. thermophilus IleRS complexed with the isoleucyl-adenylate (IleAMP) analog (N-(L-isoleucyl)-N -adenosyl-diaminosulfone, designated hereafter as Ile-AMS) (Nakama et al., unpublished results), some of the features of the ValAMS recognition by ValRS are characteristically different, but the rest are well conserved. The amino acid binding pocket in the aminoacylation site of the T. thermophilus IleRS involves Gly45, Pro46, Asp85, Trp518, Glu550, Gln554, and Trp558 (Figure 3C). These seven residues are absolutely conserved in IleRSs. Among them, Pro46, Asp85, Trp518, and Trp558 correspond to the ValRS residues Pro42, Asp81, Trp456, and Trp495, respectively (Figures 3A and 3C). The -COO group of Asp85 does not hydrogen bond with the -NH3 group of the aminoacyl moiety of Ile-AMS in the IleRS·Ile-AMS complex structure, but rather bonds with that of L-isoleucine in the previouslyreported IleRS·L-isoleucine complex structure (Nureki et al., 1998). On the other hand, the -NH2 group of the IleRS-specific Gln554 residue forms a hydrogen bond with the -CO group of the aminoacyl moiety of Ile-AMS. The -CH, 1-CH2, and 2-CH3 groups of the isoleucyl moiety contact the side chains of Gln554, Gly45, and Trp518/Trp558, respectively (Figure 3D). The -CH3 group, characterizing the isoleucyl moiety, contacts the -CH2 moiety of Glu550, which serves as the bottom of the pocket (Figure 3D). The pocket of IleRS is wider and deeper than that

of ValRS, mainly because of the replacement of the ValRS Pro41 by the IleRS Gly45 (Figures 3B and 3D). Therefore, the isoleucyl moiety is located appreciably deeper in the IleRS pocket than the valyl moiety is in the ValRS pocket (Figures 3B and 3D). Thus, the hydrophobic pocket of ValRS excludes L-isoleucine and larger amino acids, and snugly fits L-valine with respect to both its size and shape (Figures 3A and 3B). Nevertheless, the isosteric L-threonine may fit into the pocket of ValRS (Figure 3B). These features agree with the concept of the first, size-based sieve in the double-sieve mechanism of ValRS (Figure 1) (Fersht, 1985). On the other hand, IleRS and ValRS recognize the adenosyl moiety in a similar manner, except for the 6-NH2 group (Figures 3A and 3C). The KMSKS loop of ValRS interacts with the adenosyl moiety, through the hydrogen bond between the -CO group of Met529 and the adenine 6-NH2 group (the "closed" form), while that of IleRS is far away from the adenosyl moiety (the "open" form). The closed form of the "KMSKS" loop in the T. thermophilus ValRS·tRNAVal· Val-AMS structure is well conserved in the T. thermophilus LeuRS·Leu-AMS structure (Cusack et al., 2000) and in the E. coli GlnRS·tRNAGln·ATP and GlnRS·tRNAGln·GlnAMS structures (Rould et al., 1989; Rath et al., 1998). It is likely that the KMSKS loop in the closed form may prevent ATP and aminoacyl-adenylate from entering or leaving the binding pocket. On the other hand, the open form of the KMSKS loop is observed in the ligand free and Ile-AMS bound T. thermophilus IleRS (Nureki et al., 1998; Nakama et al., unpublished results), as well as in the ligand free E. coli and T. thermophilus MetRSs

(Mechulam et al., 1999; Sugiura et al., 2000). The substrates for aminoacyl-adenylate synthesis can bind to the catalytic site much more easily with the open form KMSKS loop than with the closed form loop. The KMSKS loop appears to be able to change its conformation between the closed and open forms, without steric hindrance by tRNA, in the T. thermophilus ValRS complex structure. The role of the conformational change of the KMSKS loop in Thr-AMP and Val-AMP hydrolysis by ValRS and IleRS, respectively, is discussed below. Specific Interaction of the 3 -Terminal Adenosine with the Editing Site, which Serves as the Second Sieve The overall structure of the tRNA bound ValRS exhibits significant geometrical similarity with that of the T. thermophilus IleRS in a tRNA free state with an rmsd of ° 2.89 A over 608 residues. Most of the domains are superimposable between the two protein structures. The editing domain, CP-1, of the T. thermophilus ValRS is arranged in a similar position as that of the T. thermophi° lus IleRS, and the editing active site is 37 A away from the aminoacylation site in the present structure (Figure 2). The enzyme bound tRNAVal has an L-shaped structure, like the enzyme free tRNAPhe (Sussman and Kim, 1976), with an angle formed by the acceptor and anticodon arms of about 90 (Figure 2). The 3 terminal strand of tRNAVal extends straight to the editing domain, and is bound in the deep cleft formed by the protruding -ribbon and the -barrel structure (Figures 2, 4A, and 4B). Concomitantly, the G1·C72 base pair of tRNAVal is

disrupted in this ValRS bound structure (Figure 4A). The extended 3 -terminal strand of tRNAVal contrasts sharply with the folded-back strand of tRNAGln in the aminoacylation complex of E. coli GlnRS (Rould et al., 1989; Rath et al., 1998) (Figure 4B). The 3 -terminal strand of tRNAVal is held primarily by interactions with the protein. The cytosine base of C74 contacts the side chains of Leu278 and Glu281, while the base and ribose moieties of C75 contact the side chains of Glu261 and Phe264, respectively (Figure 4A). The 3 -terminal adenosine, A76, is more specifically recognized by the editing domain. The 5 -phosphate group of A76 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Tyr337 (not shown). The adenine base of A76 is sandwiched between the side chains of Phe264 and Leu269 through van-der-Waals contacts (Figure 4C). The N1 atom and 6-NH2 group of A76 form hydrogen bonds with the -NH and -CO groups, respectively, of Glu261 (Figure 4C). These amino acid residues involved in the 3 -terminal A76 recognition are highly conserved among ValRSs. The base-specific recognition of A76 is consistent with the previous biochemical result that E. coli ValRS exhibited much lower hydrolytic editing activities with ThrtRNAVal variants with the 3 -terminal A76 replaced by C, G, and U (Tamura et al., 1994). Furthermore, the 2 -OH group of A76 forms a hydrogen bond with the -OH group of Thr214 (Figure 4C). Thus, the present complex structure is likely to represent the interaction of ValRS with tRNAVal at the posttransfer editing step for the ThrtRNAVal hydrolysis. To compare ValRS and IleRS, the structure of the T. thermophilus ValRS editing domain with the bound CCA end of tRNAVal was superposed on that of the T. thermophilus IleRS editing domain (Nureki et al., 1998) (rmsd ° 1.75 A over 157 residues). The aforementioned A76interacting elements of ValRS (Figure 4C) are spatially conserved in the IleRS structure; the side chains of the invariant Thr214, Phe264, and Leu269 of ValRS spatially correspond to those of Thr228, Trp227, and Val318, respectively, of IleRS, and the main chain of the ValRS Glu261 is superposable on that of the IleRS Ser310. Thus, the 3 -terminal A76 residue was fitted into the corresponding site in

the IleRS structure without any modification (Figure 5A). Therefore, this suggests that A76 is recognized in the same manner by the IleRS and ValRS editing domains (Figures 5A and 5B). As for the T. thermophilus IleRS, the structures of the complexes of IleRS with L-isoleucine and L-valine were reported in addition to that of IleRS in the free state (Nureki et al., 1998). The electron density of L-valine was observed not only on the Rossmann-fold aminoacylation domain but also on the editing domain of the T. thermophilus IleRS (Nureki et al., 1998). We observed two additional electron densities on the editing domain in an initially refined |Fo-Fc| map. In the atomic model reported in Nureki et al. (1998), the two electron densities were assigned to L-valine and water molecules, respectively, as shown previously. The reverse assignment was also possible, and gave an omit map (Nureki et al., 1998), where the L-valine molecule is located in close proximity to the 2 -OH group of the A76 residue fitted on the IleRS structure (Figure 5A). The -NH3 group hydrogen bonds with the -O of Asp328 and the -CO of His319, and the -COO group hydrogen bonds with the -OH groups of Thr228 and Thr230, respectively (Figure 5A). The side chain of L-valine is surrounded by the side chains of Thr233, His319, and Ala321, and the main chains of Phe324 and Gly325 of the IleRS. In other IleRSs, Thr230, Thr233, His319, and Asp328 are completely conserved, and Ala321 is conserved or replaced by Ser. The pocket is just as large as L-valine, but is too small for L-isoleucine. An additional CH3 group of L-isoleucine clashes with the main chain of Phe324 or the side chain of Asp328. A slight rotation of the -COO group around the C -CO bond of the bound L-valine molecule allows the covalent linkage of the -CO group of L-valine to the OH group of the modeled A76 moiety (Figure 5A). Therefore, the valine binding pocket near the A76 binding site on the IleRS editing domain is concluded to be for the posttransfer editing, to hydrolyze Val-tRNAIle. The previously reported valine binding pocket of IleRS is discussed below with respect to the pretransfer editing. On the other hand, in the T. thermophilus ValRS structure, Arg216, Thr219, Lys270, Thr272, Asp276, and Asp279 are

near the A76 binding site (Figure 5B), and form a more hydrophilic pocket, which spatially corresponds to the pocket for L-valine of the IleRS editing domain. These amino acid residues are strictly conserved in ValRSs. We manually fitted L-threonine into the ValRS pocket, in a manner similar to the binding of L-valine to the posttransfer editing pocket of IleRS. The Asp279 side chain of ValRS protrudes into the pocket, as compared with that of the corresponding Asp328 residue in the T. thermophilus IleRS. Thus, to avoid steric clash with the threonine molecule, the -COO group of Asp279 was rotated by 4 around the C ­C bond, and by 54 around the C ­C bond. In this model, the -CO group of the L-threonine is covalently bonded to the 2 -OH group of A76, and the -NH3 group forms a hydrogen bond with the 2-O atom of Asp279 (Figure 5B). As for the side chain of the threonyl moiety, the -OH group also forms a hydrogen bond with the 1-O atom of Asp279, while the -CH3 group is sandwiched between the -CH2 of Arg216 and the -CH2 of Lys270. In addition, the -OH group may be recognized by the ValRS-characteristic Asp276. A valyl moiety should be precluded from fitting into this pocket because of the lack of proper hydrogen bonding with the -O atom of Asp279. In contrast, the aminoacyl moieties of cysteinyl-tRNAVal and -aminobutyryl-tRNAVal may be accepted and hydrolyzed, because they are smaller than that of Val-tRNAVal by one CH3 group.

The present ValRS complex structure reveals that, at the posttransfer editing step, the second sieve of ValRS distinguishes L-threonine from L-valine based on the characteristic -OH group, whereas that of IleRS discriminates L-valine from L-isoleucine based primarily on the size. The comparison of the posttransfer editing sites between ValRS and IleRS demonstrates that a similar hydrolytic reaction accompanies the different manners of substrate selection.

Comparison between the tRNA-Complexed IleRS and ValRS Structures In the S. aureus IleRS complex structure, the 3 end of tRNAIle is not bound in the aminoacylation site (Silvian et al., 1999). Moreover, although the 3 terminal acceptor strand of tRNAIle projects toward the editing domain, C75 and A76 are structurally disordered, probably because of the lack of interaction between the CCA end and the editing domain (Silvian et al., 1999). Correspondingly, it was also reported that the IleRS editing domain is worse ordered than other domains (Silvian et al., 1999). The editing domain of the S. aureus IleRS complex is rotated by about 47 (Silvian et al., 1999) as compared with that of the tRNA free T. thermophilus IleRS (Nureki et al., 1998). Therefore, in modeling the missing 3 CA of tRNAIle, as reported by Silvian et al. (1999), the 3

terminal adenosine cannot reach the editing active site described above. Thus, the S. aureus IleRS complex structure does not represent the Val-tRNAIle hydrolysis. In contrast, the editing domain of the T. thermophilus ValRS is arranged in a similar position as that of the tRNA free T. thermophilus IleRS, and can hold the 3 CCA end of tRNAVal, representing the interaction of ValRS with tRNAVal for the Thr-tRNAVal hydrolysis (Figures 2 and 4A). Therefore, the editing domain can adopt two distinct orientations in the tRNA-complexed state. The two orientations are designated hereafter as "orientations I and II": orientation I corresponds to the editing domains of the tRNA free T. thermophilus IleRS and the tRNA bound T. thermophilus ValRS, while orientation II corresponds to that of the S. aureus IleRS complex. Comparison of the tRNA free T. thermophilus IleRS, tRNA bound S. aureus IleRS, and tRNA bound T. thermophilus ValRS structures reveals that the two different orientations of the editing domain are due to the conformational difference at the hinge connecting it to the CP core (Figure 6A). Actually, this hinge is observed in the corresponding position in the E. coli and T. thermophilus MetRSs, which also possess much smaller CP-1 subdomains than those of IleRS and ValRS (Mechulam et al., 1999; Sugiura et al., 2000). In these two MetRS structures, the CP-1 orientations are different (Figure 6A). In solution, the different CP-1 orientations may be similarly stable. In the present T. thermophilus ValRS complex structure, the editing domain adopts orientation I, and prevents the 3 end of tRNAVal from approaching and entering the aminoacylation site (Figures 6B and 6D). However, if the editing domain of ValRS adopts orientation II, then the 3 terminal acceptor strand of tRNAVal can simply fold back (Figures 6B and 6C), as observed for E. coli tRNAGln (Rould et al., 1989) (Figure 4B), without steric hindrance with the polypeptide chain of the enzyme, and enter the aminoacylation site. A model structure of ValRS·tRNAVal at the aminoacylation step was built by combining nucleotides 1­69 of T. thermophilus tRNAVal and nucleotides 70­76 of E. coli tRNAGln, after superposition of E. coli tRNAGln on T. thermophilus tRNAVal on the basis of the acceptor-stem and anticodon­stem structures. No further modification was necessary. In this aminoacylation model structure of the ValRS complex, the 2 -OH group of A76 is positioned close to the -CO group of the valyl moiety of Val-AMS. In the S. aureus IleRS complex structure (adopting orientation II), a similar aminoacylation model was also bulit, but some modification was required (Silvian et al., 1999). In the S. aureus IleRS complex structure, the long carboxylate tail of mupirocin bound in the aminoacylation site pushed the KMSKS loop more open than usual, and the concomitant steric hindrance between the KMSKS loop and the tRNAIle D stem appeared to have caused the extraordinary positioning of the tRNAIle (Protein Data Bank accession code 1QU2). The Pretransfer Editing Several biochemical studies have suggested that the sites for aminoacylation and editing are separate in IleRS (Schmidt and Schimmel, 1994; Farrow et al., 1999; Nomanbhoy et al., 1999) and ValRS (Lin and Schimmel, 1996; Nomanbhoy and Schimmel, 2000). Actually, the

editing domains of IleRS and ValRS have the posttransfer editing activity by themselves (Lin et al., 1996), and an IleRS mutant [ (219 to 265)] that lacks 47 amino acid residues in the editing domain cannot hydrolyze ValtRNAIle (Nureki et al., 1998). Hence, the editing domain has been proven to be responsible for the posttransfer editing. In addition, we have reported that a single point mutation, either T243A or N250A, in the E. coli IleRS editing domain completely abolishes the editing activity for both Val-AMP and Val-tRNAIle hydrolysis (Nureki et al., 1998). This study indicates that the editing domain of IleRS is also responsible for the pretransfer editing. However, in contrast to the case of the posttransfer editing, it remains unclear how an incorrectly synthesized aminoacyl-adenylate is transferred from the aminoacylation site to the editing site. As for the pretransfer editing of the Val-AMP by IleRS, Silvian et al. (1999) pointed out that a channel spans the aminoacylation site and the editing site in the S. aureus IleRS complex structure, and implied that a Val-AMP molecule diffuses from the aminoacylation site to the editing site through the channel at the pretransfer editing step ("the diffusion model"). Furthermore, with respect to the tRNA-dependency of the pretransfer editing, it was suggested that the opening of the KMSKS loop might be promoted by the binding of tRNAIle and might result in easier release of Val-AMP from the aminoacylation site (Silvian et al., 1999). On the other hand, in the present T. thermophilus ValRS complex, the closed form of the KMSKS loop covers the aminoacylation site, just like the flap of a pocket (Figure 3A), and the corresponding channel is blocked by the long -ribbon structure of the editing domain (Figure 6D) due to the editing domain in orientation I. Around the aminoacylation site, there are no more than two small rooms: one is for the - and -phosphates of ATP, and the other is for the 3 -A of tRNAVal. However, if the editing domain of ValRS adopts orientation II, then the channel is formed (Figures 6E and 6F), suggesting that the translocation of the Thr-AMP by the ValRS· tRNAVal complex occurs in a similar manner as that of the Val-AMP by the IleRS·tRNAIle complex. In addition, as we pointed out above, with the other conformation, the open form of the KMSKS loop, the Thr-AMP molecule can leave the aminoacylation site for the pretransfer editing site of the ValRS editing domain. As far as the present ValRS·tRNA complex structure is concerned, opening/closing of the KMSKS loop does not seem to be tRNA-dependent. Nevertheless, the diffusion model may explain the tRNA-dependency of the pretransfer editing, because the channel is composed of both ValRS and tRNA. As for tRNAIle, three nucleotide residues, and probably their posttranscriptional modifications, in the D loop are important for the editing by IleRS (Hale et al., 1997; Farrow et al., 1999), although this region of tRNA is not involved in the interaction with IleRS (Silvian et al., 1999). As the D loop is involved in tertiary interactions with the T loop, it is possible that the proper L-shaped tertiary structure retained by the loop­loop interactions is required for the tRNA-dependent pretransfer editing. At the end of the channel on the ValRS·tRNAVal complex, we can find the posttransfer editing site described above. If the threonyl moieties of Thr-AMP and Thr-

The "Double-Sieve" Amino Acid Selection by ValRS (A) A C -trace representation around the "hinges" in the S.aureus IleRS (green), the T. thermophilus IleRS (magenta), the T. thermophilus ValRS (yellow), the E. coli MetRS (blue), and the T. thermophilus MetRS (red). The S.aureus IleRS and the T. thermophilus ValRS are tRNA bound, while the T. thermophilus IleRS, the E. coli MetRS (blue), and the T. thermophilus MetRS are tRNA free. For each of these synthetases, the two amino acid residues on the boundary between the CP-1 subdomain and the CP core are shown in a ball and stick representation. (B) The aminoacyl-adenylate synthesis. Larger L-isoleucine is precluded, but isosteric L-threonine, smaller L-cysteine, and L- -aminobutyrate may be accepted in addition to the cognate L-valine. The KMSKS loop in the closed form is colored in yellow. The editing domain is in orientation I. (C) The aminoacylation of tRNAVal. The dark violet arrow represents the rotation of the editing domain from orientation I (B) to orientation II (C), which allows the CCA end (colored in magenta) of tRNAVal to fold back and enter the aminoacylation site. In addition to the valyl moiety of Val AMP, the aminoacyl moieties of Thr-AMP, cysteinyl-adenylate, and -aminobutyryl-adenylate may be transferred to the 3 -A of tRNAVal. The KMSKS loop in the closed form is colored in yellow. (D) The posttransfer editing. After the aminoacylation of tRNAVal, the aminoacylated 3 -A of tRNAVal is released from the aminoacylation site. The dark violet arrow represents the rotation of the editing domain from orientation II (C) to orientation I (D). Then, the threonylated, cysteinylated, or -aminobutyrylated 3 -A (but not the valylated 3 -A) of tRNAVal is caught and hydrolyzed by the editing domain in orientation I. Consequently, only the Val-tRNAVal is produced. (E) The pretransfer editing. Before the transfer of the aminoacyl moiety to the 3 -A of tRNAVal with the editing domain in orientation II (C), the flexible CCA segment may take another conformation with the 3 -A exposed to the solvent (E). Thus, a channel is formed to span the aminoacylation site on the Rossmann-fold domain and the editing site on the editing domain in orientation II. The opening of the KMSKS loop

The amino acid residues constituting the Thr binding pocket are shown with their carbon atoms colored in yellow. Onto this real structure, ThrAMP is modeled, as shown translucently with the carbon atoms colored in green. Right, a contact-surface representation. The editing domain of ValRS is shown in brown.

tRNAVal share the same pocket at both the pretransfer and posttransfer editing steps, then the adenosyl moiety of the Thr-AMP cannot bind to the pocket for that of the Thr-tRNAVal. Although the adenosyl moiety can contact the rather flat surface of the cleft in the editing domain, we could not find any pocket to accommodate the adenine ring of the Thr-AMP. On the other hand, if the adenosyl moieties of Thr-AMP and Thr-tRNAVal share the same pocket, then we can easily find a pocket for the threonyl-moiety of the Thr-AMP, which is near the 5 -PO4 group of the 3 -terminal A76 of tRNAVal. At the corresponding position in the IleRS editing domain, a hydrophobic pocket has been identified by Nureki et al. (1998). Therefore, we made a docking model of Val AMP and the IleRS editing domain, and that of ThrAMP and the ValRS editing domain, which are likely to represent the pretransfer editing step. As shown in Figure 7A, the valine side chain of Val AMP is fitted into the hydrophobic pocket consisting of Thr230, Trp232,

Tyr386, and Tyr398 of IleRS, as reported by Nureki et al. (1998). These four residues are conserved or replaced by functionally equivalent residues in IleRSs. In particular, Trp232, Tyr386, and Tyr398 are characteristic of IleRS. The putative pretransfer editing pocket, as well as the posttransfer editing pocket, of IleRS is just as large as the valyl moiety, and thus cannot accommodate the isoleucyl moiety. On the other hand, in the model of Thr-AMP and the ValRS editing domain (Figure 7B), the -NH3 group forms a hydrogen bond with the 2-O atom of Asp276. As for the side chain of the threonyl moiety, the -OH group forms a hydrogen bond with the 2-NH2 of Arg216, while the -CH3 group is sandwiched between the -CH2 of Arg216 and the -CH of Leu341. A valyl moiety should be precluded from fitting into this pocket, because of the lack of the proper hydrogen bond with the 2-NH2 of Arg216 at the pretransfer editing step. The T. thermophilus ValRS Arg216 and Asp276 are conserved in other ValRSs,

(colored in red) promotes the translocation of Thr-AMP, cysteinyl-adenylate, and -aminobutyryl-adenylate from the aminoacylation site to the editing site through the channel. Due to orientation II of the editing domain, the 3 -A of tRNAVal cannot bind to the adenosyl-moiety binding site in the editing domain. Thus, the editing domain can accept Thr-AMP, cysteinyl-adenylate, and -aminobutyryl-adenylate and hydrolyze them. The arrow represents the KMSKS loop movement from the closed form (yellow) to the open form (red). (F) A molecular surface representation of the model of the ValRS (blue)· tRNAVal (red) complex in the pretransfer editing state. The open and closed forms of the KMSKS loop are shown as red and yellow backbone worms, respectively. This view highlights the channel spanning the aminoacylation site and the editing site.

as mentioned above, and Leu341 is conserved or replaced by Val/Ile. The threonyl moiety to be removed by hydrolysis might be discriminated from the valyl moiety by specific recognition of the -OH group at the pretransfer editing step as well as the posttransfer editing step. In addition, this putative pretransfer editing pocket of ValRS may accommodate the cysteinyl moiety of cysteinyl adenylate (Jakubowski, 1980; Jakubowski and Fersht, 1981) and the -aminobutyryl moiety of -aminobutyryl adenylate (Fersht and Dingwall, 1979; Jakubowski, 1980), because the sizes of their side chains are smaller than that of L-valine by one CH3 group. On our present assumption, the same adenosyl binding site is utilized at the pretransfer and posttransfer editing steps, while the aminoacyl binding sites are discrete. Actually, the mutations T243A and N250A in E. coli IleRS are supposed to affect the posttransfer editing pathway, and furthermore, completely abolish both of the pretransfer and posttransfer editing activities (Nureki et al., 1998).
Experimental Procedures

cedures with the programs XPLOR (Brunger, 1992) and CNS ¨ (Brunger et al., 1998). The model of the tRNAVal CCA end was addi¨ tionally built in a a-weighted phase combined electron density map after the initial refinement. All measured data within a resolution of ° 30.0 and 2.9 A (with the exception of the random 5% of reflections used for the calculation of Rfree) were used in the refinement, during which bulk solvent correction was applied to the reflection data. The Ramachandran plot analysis with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed that 98.0% of the residues in the present structure are in the most favored and additionally allowed regions. Molecular graphics pictures in Figures 1­7 were prepared by using the programs O (Jones et al., 1991), Molmol (Koradi et al., 1996), Molscript (Kraulis, 1991), and Raster3D (Merritt and Bacon, 1997).

Crystallization Overproduction and purification of the T. thermophilus ValRS were carried out in a similar way as that of the T. thermophilus IleRS (Nureki et al., 1998). The T. thermophilus tRNAVal isoacceptor with the CAC anticodon was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. Crystals were grown at 4 C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method over a period of 2 months. The protein/tRNA solution for crystallization was prepared at a final protein concentration of 7­10 mg/ml for molar ratios of ValRS, tRNA, and Val-AMS of 1:1.1:2. 1 l of the protein/tRNA solution was mixed with 1 l of a crystallization solution, 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1.0 M ammonium sulfate, 10 mM magnesium sulfate, and 6% 1,8-diaminooctane. The drop solution was slowly equilibrated against a reservoir solution, 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 2.8 M ammonium sulfate and 10 mM magnesium sulfate. Crystallographic Analysis For data collection under cryo conditions, the concentration of ethylene glycol in the mother liquor was increased to 23% in three steps (5%, 15%, and 23%) by using micro dialysis before flash cooling. The first two dialysis steps were thirty minutes each and the last step was one hour. All data collections were carried out at 90 K. Native and K2PtCl4 derivative data sets were collected at station ° BL41XU, SPring8, Harima, Japan ( 0.708 A). Two NaAuCl4 derivative data sets were collected at station BL44B2, SPring8, Harima, ° Japan ( 1.00 A) and on a laboratory detection system comprising an R-axisIV image plate in conjunction with mirror-focused CuK X-rays from a Rigaku rotating anode generator, UltraX18. All of the data sets were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Subsequent phase calculations were carried out with the CCP4 program suite (CCP4, 1994). The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement augmented with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) using three derivatized crystals. Initially, two major heavy atom sites were identified in the difference Patterson map of the platinum derivative. The other platinum sites and the gold sites were identified from cross-difference Fourier maps. Heavy atom refinement and phase calculations were performed with the program MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994). The application of density modification procedures, including solvent flattening (75% estimated solvent), histogram matching, and noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, with the program DM (CCP4, 1994), improved the quality of the phases sufficiently to yield an interpretable electron density map. Iterative model building and density modification with an improved mask greatly enhanced the quality of the electron density map. The model, except the tRNAVal CCA end, was built using the program O (Jones et al., 1991), and was refined by conventional minimization and simulated annealing pro-
