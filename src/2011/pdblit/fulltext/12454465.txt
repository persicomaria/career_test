The intensely sweet protein thaumatin has been crystallized at 293 K in the presence of sodium tartrate and 25%(v/v) glycerol for X-ray diffraction data collection at 100 K. A comparison of the three-dimensional structure model derived from a crystal grown in the presence of glycerol with that of a control deprived of this additive reveals only minor changes in the overall structure but a $20% reduction in the number of water molecules. X-ray topography analyses show that the overall quality of the crystals prepared in the presence of this cryoprotectant is enhanced.

1. Introduction
Pure glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol; C3H8O3) is a clear, viscous and dense glass-forming liquid having a sweet taste. It occurs naturally in fatty-acid esters present in animal and plant tissues. Since its discovery in olive oil by C. W. Scheele in 1779 (the name glycerin was coined by E. Chevreul in 1813), it has found a myriad of uses in all branches of industry. The structure of glycerol has been investigated by most physical methods. Neutron and X-ray diffraction studies indicate that in the liquid state the molecules are ordered in a network that is strongly hydrogen bonded, each monomer having 6±7 hydroxyl neighbours (Champeney et al., 1986; Sarkar & Joarder, 1996). Like most polyols and polysaccharides, glycerol stabilizes the native structure of proteins and the activity of enzymes in aqueous solution when it is the co-solvent (see, for example, Priev et al., 1996; Farnum & Zukoski, 1999). As an osmolyte, it is strongly excluded from the protein domain and favours its hydration (Gekko & Timasheff, 1981; Arakawa & Timasheff, 1985). Its high viscosity strongly affects the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of proteins: it reduces the ¯exibility required for the conformational change of the polypeptide fold (Rosenberg et al., 1989; Ansari et al., 1992, Gonnelli & Strambini, 1993; Tsai et al., 2000). In protein crystallography, glycerol was one of the ®rst substances used as a cryoprotective agent for X-ray diffraction data collection at sub-zero temperatures (Douzou et al., 1975; Petsko, 1975). At 110 K, a 10±30%(v/v) concentration reduces the rate of ice nucleation and so favours the formation of a glass in which the protein crystal is stable (Rodgers, 1994). Glycerol and other structure-stabilizing compounds can increase the diffraction limit and the order in soft protein crystals (Sousa, 1995, and references therein). Despite the great interest in glycerol, no comparative study of a threedimensional protein fold and of its hydration shell in the presence versus in the absence of glycerol has been reported. Here, we report the effect of glycerol on monomeric thaumatin in crystals prepared in the presence and absence of this

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and protein crystallization

All solutions were made up with ultrapure sterile water and were ®ltered through membranes with a 0.22 mm pore size (Ultrafree-MC; Cat. No. UFC30GV00, Millipore). DNase-, RNase- and protease-free glycerol (Mr = 92.09; d = 1.26) was a gift from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). N-[2-Acetamido]2-iminodiacetic acid (ADA; Cat. No. A-9883), tartaric acid (Cat. No. T-5259) and lyophilized thaumatin I from Thaumatoccus daniellii (Cat. No. T-7638, Lot 108F00299) were purchased from Sigma. The protein (Swiss±Prot code P02883; 207 amino acids; Mr = 22 204) was dissolved in water and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10 000 rev minÀ1. After ®ltration, the concentration of soluble thaumatin was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coef®cient of 1.25 for a 1 mg mlÀ1 solution (1 cm path length). Crystallization assays were set up at 293 K using the vapour-diffusion method in 20 ml hanging drops deposited on glass cover slips coated with a hydrophobic organosilane. The reservoir contained 1 ml of 0±25%(v/v) glycerol solution made with 0.73 M tartaric acid in 0.1 M ADA adjusted to pH 6.5 with NaOH. Drops were prepared by mixing 10 ml of protein solution at 35 mg mlÀ1 with 10 ml of reservoir solution.

Diffraction data were collected at LURE (Orsay, France) under cryogenic conditions on the wiggler beamline DW32 Ê (! = 0.9474 A; beam diameter 300 mm) equipped with a MAR345 imaging-plate detector (MAR Research, Hamburg). A 700 mm long bipyramidal crystal was withdrawn from a crystallization drop and frozen at 100 K in the nitrogen stream. A control crystal of similar size (and volume) prepared without glycerol was ¯ash-frozen after an $10 s dip in mother liquor containing 25%(v/v) glycerol. The crystal-todetector distance was 175 mm and the exposure time was 120 s for 0.5 oscillations. Both data sets were processed in a similar manner using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996) (Table 1). The indexed intensities were converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) without any ' cutoff. The structures were solved using a model derived from a crystal grown in the absence of glycerol and at room temperature (Ko et al., 1994; PDB code 1thw). As the space groups of the crystals were identical, the ®rst step of the structure determination was a rigid-body re®nement. A total of 10% of each set of data were randomly selected for Rfree calculations. A molecular-dynamics re®nement using the
Acta Cryst. (2002). D58, 2060±2065

simulated-annealing technique was performed using the CNS Ê È package (Brunger et al., 1998) in the 30±1.36 A range for the Ê structure without glycerol and in the 30±1.25 A range for that with glycerol. Electron-density maps were calculated to correct and rebuild the model wherever necessary using O (Jones et al., 1991). At this stage, the electron-density maps revealed density corresponding to one tartrate molecule per asymmetric unit, as described previously (Ko et al., 1994). The model was further re®ned and water molecules were de®ned È using the CNS package (Brunger et al., 1998). This was performed in several steps based on peaks of at least 3' in the Fo À Fc map and 1' in the resulting 2Fo À Fc map. Cycles of positional and B-factor re®nement and the location of water molecules were continued until no signi®cant density (>3' in Fo À Fc maps) was left. The stereochemical acceptability of the structure was veri®ed using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The re®nement parameters are given in Table 1. The hydrogen bonds were determined in both structures using the program HBPLUS (McDonald & Thornton, 1994).
2.3. X-ray topography analysis

Rocking curves and X-ray topography images were recorded to compare the crystalline quality of crystals grown with and without addition of glycerol. Details of the experimental setting at beamline D25 of LURE (Fourme et al., 1995) and of the analytical procedure (Lorber, Sauter, Ng et al., 1999) have been described previously. The degree of perfecCharron et al.

tion of thaumatin crystals was estimated by measuring the fullwidth at half-maximum (FWHM) of individual (00l) and (hk0) Bragg re¯ection pro®les. The FWHM w(00l) and w(hk0) measure the global misorientation of the blocks forming the crystals in directions that are respectively normal and parallel to the c axis of the bipyramid (Lorber, Sauter, Ng et al., 1999; Robert et al., 2001). X-ray topography images were recorded on ®lm when the intensity of the diffraction was suf®cient. The contrasted regions of the topographs reveal defects. with or without 25%(v/v) glycerol. All crystals belong to space group P41212 (Table 1). Their unit-cell parameters are similar to those of previously reported crystals (Ko et al., 1994). X-ray diffraction data were collected at a synchrotron beamline. The Ê Ê resolution range was 30±1.36 A and 30±1.25 A for crystals grown without and with 25%(v/v) glycerol, respectively. Overall, the data set of the crystal that was prepared without  glycerol  an Rsym of 4.9% on intensities had (Rsym = |I À hIi|/ I) and was 99.9% complete; that of the crystal grown with 25%(v/v) glycerol had an Rsym of 4.6 and was 96.9% complete (no strategy program was used to optimize data collection) (Table 1). The structure without glycerol was re®ned to a ®nal R factor of 19.5% and an Rfree of 20.4%. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of thaumatin (207 residues), one molecule of tartrate and 323 molecules of water. On the other hand, the structure of thaumatin with glycerol was re®ned to a ®nal R factor of 17.8% and an Rfree of 19.5%; using the same computational steps, only 262 water molecules could be de®ned. The average value of the B factor of the protein atoms Ê is similar in both structures (10.69 and 10.16 A2 in the folds without and with glycerol, respectively). Similarly, water molecules in both structures have close average B factors Ê (B = 21.57 and 19.81 A2 in the folds without and with glycerol, respectively). The superimposition of the coordinates of the C atoms and of the main-chain atoms in the structures derived from the crystal grown in the presence of glycerol (PDB code 1lxz) onto those in the structure derived from a crystal prepared in the absence of glycerol (PDB code 1ly0) Ê gives small r.m.s.d. values (0.107 and 0.151 A, respectively; see Ê Table 1). In Fig. 1(a), C deviations that are >0.3 A are coloured red. The three amino-acid residues Arg119, Gly162 Ê and Lys163 which have an r.m.s.d. ! 0.4 A are located in two distant loops at the surface of the protein (Fig. 1b). In the crystal packing, Gly162 and Lys163 are proximal to Arg119 belonging to another thaumatin molecule and also to Asp60 of a third molecule. All these residues point into a solvent channel.

In the structure model computed from data collected from the crystal prepared without glycerol, the hydration shell encompasses 323 water molecules. There are only 262 such molecules in the model built with the data collected from a crystal prepared with glycerol. To compare the locations of the water sites, the two structures were superimposed using a least-squares procedure as described above. We considered the centre of a ®rst site to be enclosed in the van der Waals Ê envelope of another site if they are closer than 1.4 A. According to this criterion, 247 water sites (drawn in green in Fig. 1c) are equivalent in both structures. Interestingly, half of the 76 water molecules that are speci®c to the fold obtained in the absence of glycerol are not directly in contact with the protein, but are only hydrogen bonded to other water molecules. The other half interacts either with residues of the polypeptide backbone or with side chains of acidic, basic or neutral residues. Of the 15 water molecules that are speci®c to the structure with glycerol, six interact strictly with water, one with tartrate and the others with various atoms of the protein. On the other hand, 80% of water molecules that are common to both structures do interact with protein atoms. Hence, the additional water sites that are found in the absence of glycerol are preferentially located in the second hydration shell and do not interact directly with the protein. Moreover, these additional water molecules have a higher B factor (average Ê B = 28.65 A2) than those that are common to both structures Ê (average B = 19.24 A2). Previous X-ray topography studies of thaumatin crystals can be summarized as follows. (i) Gel-grown crystals have narrower Bragg re¯ection pro®les than solution-grown crystals (the pro®les of the latter are sometimes composed of several peaks arising from the existence of several domains; Fourme et al., 1995; Vidal et al., 1999; Lorber, Sauter, Ng et al., 1999). (ii) Crystals prepared in agarose gel under microgravity are of superior quality (Lorber, Sauter, Robert et al., 1999). (iii) Except when the crystals are prepared by the batch technique (Kadri et al., 2002), all from a given experiment generally have w(00l) and w(hk0) values that are distributed over a relatively narrow range (plus or minus about 6 arcsec around the mean). Here, a preliminary study of the crystalline quality (i.e. the degree of perfection) performed on three thaumatin control crystals and on three crystals grown with glycerol has given the following results. For the control crystals, the w(00l) values were respectively not measurable (multidomain), 13 and 13HH , and the corresponding w(hk0) values were 35, 35 and 22HH . For the crystals grown with 15%(v/v) glycerol, w(00l) values were 9.5, 6.5 and 11HH , and the w(hk0) values were 23H , 29 and 42HH , respectively. While there is no striking difference in w(hk0), the values of w(00l) measured for crystals grown with glycerol are the lowest values that have ever been obtained on thaumatin crystals. A FWHM as low as 6.5HH is well below all values that have been measured on more than 200 thaumatin crystals prepared under various conditions either on earth or under microgravity. Fig. 2(a) displays one of the best X-ray topographs recorded so far; it is from a thaumatin crystal that was prepared in agarose gel under microgravity on board the space shuttle and

was characterized by a w(00l) value of only 10HH (Lorber, Sauter, Robert et al., 1999). Although all facets of the tetragonal bipyramid are well developed, the strong contrast in its central part reveals a main defect arising from strain in the core. The latter arises from a misorientation between pyramidal growth sectors growing in the opposing +c and Àc directions that originates at the level of the seed. The intensity diffracted by two crystals containing glycerol was suf®cient to record topography images (no image was recorded for control crystals because we were essentially searching for crystals that were better than the best ones ever obtained under any conditions). The topograph of the crystal with the lowest w(00l) value of 6.5HH is shown in Fig. 2(b). Like most crystals prepared in solution, the habit of the crystal is not complete; its bottom part is missing because it was in contact with the solid surface of the crystallization well. This crystal displays the same features as that in Fig. 2(a), but the lesser contrast in the central part con®rms that it has less defects.

4. Discussion and conclusion
A wide array of proteins have been crystallized in the presence of glycerol and more than 200 are found in the Protein Data Bank whose structure contains one or several ordered glycerol molecules. In contrast, no glycerol molecules are visible in the electron-density map of thaumatin. Although this additive does not signi®cantly alter the protein fold (Fig. 1b), the major effect occurs at the level of its hydration (or solvation) layer.

Indeed, there are about 25% less ordered water molecules in the presence of 25%(v/v) glycerol (Table 1). This is consistent with the observation that this triol displaces selected proteinbound water molecules. Using several other small-sized solutes (such as sucrose and ethylene or polyethylene glycol) that are commonly employed as co-solvents to increase the osmotic pressure, it has been elegantly demonstrated that a few such water molecules play a critical role in catalytic activity or in allosteric regulation (see e.g. Kornblatt & Hui Bon Hoa, 1990; Di Primo et al., 1992; Colombo et al., 1992). These water molecules are involved in extensive networks of hydrogen bonds and are an integral part of the protein structure (see, for example, Gregoriou et al., 1998). The crystallization medium containing a high concentration of glycerol has some peculiar properties compared with the medium deprived of glycerol. For instance, a 25%(v/v) aqueous glycerol solution has an osmotic pressure of 10 MPa, equivalent to 100 times atmospheric pressure. This may seem a high value, but thaumatin in aqueous solution (deprived of glycerol) is in fact not denatured when it is subjected to a 25-fold higher hydrostatic pressure (Kadri et al., 2002). At atmospheric pressure and in the presence of glycerol, the rate of equilibration of protein-solution droplets by vapour diffusion is signi®cantly reduced; we observed that the ®rst thaumatin crystal appeared after 30 d in the presence of 25%(v/v) glycerol and after 18 d in 15%(v/v) glycerol, compared with after 3 d in its absence. In addition, the viscosity of the crystallizing solution [/0 = 2.06 for an aqueous 25%(v/v) solution at 293 K] may attenuate convection suf®ciently to favour matter transport by diffusion. Under such conditions, the crystal-growth rate may be limited by the kinetics of molecular incorporation and this may contribute to enhancing the order within the lattice. The preliminary results of our analysis of the crystalline quality are encouraging. More systematic investigations are necessary to assess the improvement of the degree of perfection of the crystal nucleus when nucleation occurs in the presence of glycerol. In the experiments reported here, the solubility of the protein was 2.5 and 6 times greater in the presence of 15 and 25%(v/v) glycerol, respectively [mean S (with standard deviation) in mg mlÀ1 of four independent experiments was 5.6 (0.9) and 14 (1)] than that in its absence [where S = 2.2 (0.2) mg mlÀ1]. The preferential hydration of proteins in glycerol±water mixtures (Gekko & Timasheff, 1981) and the weak interactions controlling protein stability and association (Timasheff, 1993) have been documented. These phenomena suggest that protein±protein interactions in solution (and possibly in the crystal) might be affected. Experimentally, it has been shown that glycerol changes the interaction and the solubility of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor by increasing the intermolecular repulsion (this leads to an increase in the second virial coef®cient; Farnum & Zukoski, 1999). This effect may be much stronger in the particular case of enzymes binding polysaccharides. For instance, glycerol binds at the catalytic site of glycogen phosphorylase and competes with the substrate glucose-1-P and its analogues, thus preventing the formation of complexes (Tsitsanou et al., 1999). For this reason, the conditions for cryoprotection had to be changed for this protein. For protein crystallization and crystallography, glycerol is an attractive additive because it permits the vitri®cation of aqueous solutions and the collection of X-ray diffraction data under cryogenic conditions. Despite the practical aspects of this cryoprotectant, experimenters should be aware that it can bind in an ordered way to the protein when it is added as a stabilizing agent during puri®cation and/or crystallization. A very short soaking time (<30 s after crystallization has ceased) may be suf®cient to observe it in the electron-density map (see, for example, Adler et al., 2000). A comparison of structures containing glycerol shows that one or several molecules may associate more or less speci®cally to surface residues. Glycerol also diffuses into clefts or into deep pockets. Once it has been in contact with the protein prior to crystallization, it may stick to it and hinder its assembly by occupying potential crystal contacts. For instance, cytoplasmic yeast aspartyltRNA synthetase could never be crystallized when it was puri®ed in the presence of glycerol (Sauter et al., 1999).
