ABSTRACT: The E6 protein from high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) binds PDZ-domain containing proteins and targets them for degradation. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure the interaction of a peptide from the C-terminus of HPV-18 E6 to the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) from the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein (hDlg). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments with a series of peptides showed that HPV-18 E6 bound hDlg PDZ2 about 5-fold stronger than HPV-16 E6, that the contribution of Arg154 to binding was about 1 kcal/mol, and that the binding was disabled by phosphorylation at Thr156. We then used NMR to determine the solution structure of the complex of PDZ2 bound to the HPV-18 E6 peptide. The resultant structures were of high quality and had backbone root-mean-square deviations of less than 0.5 Å. The structure shows a novel mode of interaction in which six residues of the HPV-18 E6 peptide are contacted by the PDZ2 domain, in contrast to the typical four residues used by class I PDZ domains. Molecular dynamics simulations supported a model in which the C- and N-terminal ends of the peptide had different mobilities within the complex. Comparison of the NMR complex structure to previously determined X-ray structures of PDZ2 by itself and bound to different peptides allows a description of conformational changes required for PDZ2 to bind to HPV-18 E6.

Papillomaviruses are small double stranded DNA viruses that infect both mucosal and cutaneous epithelial tissues. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV1) is strongly associated with the development of malignant lesions and promote cervical cancer in over 95% of cases (1). HPV-16 and HPV18 are the most common types in invasive cervical squamous cell carcinomas, accounting for over 65% of these cancers. HPV-18 is the predominant type in cervical adenocarcinomas, followed by HPV-16 (2, 3). The E6 protein is multifunctional, and many cellular targets have been identified. The most extensively studied function of E6 is complex formation with the cellular E6-associated ubiquitin ligase protein (E6AP), which subsequently targets p53 for degradation, thereby preventing the cell apoptosis associated with viral infection (4). HPV E6 also possesses p53-independent

functions, which are also necessary for transformation. Numerous E6-interacting proteins harbor PDZ (PSD95/Discs Large/ZO-1) domains including a human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein (hDlg, also known as SAP-97) (5, 6), a human homologue of the Drosophila scribble tumor suppressor protein (hScrib) (7) and others (8-10). Like the degradation of p53 (11), these PDZ proteins have been shown to be targeted by E6APdependent, proteasome-mediated degradation (7-10, 1215). The high-risk HPV E6 proteins deregulate aspects of cell growth and polarity in response to cell contact through the degradation of hDlg (5, 6, 12-14). E6 mutants losing the ability to bind to hDlg are no longer able to induce E6-dependent transformation of rodent cells (5). These results suggest that interaction between the E6 protein and hDlg or other PDZ domain-containing proteins is an underlying mechanism in the development of HPV-associated cancers. PDZ binding motifs have been identified in several virus proteins associated with oncogenesis, including the HTLV-1 Tax protein (16), the adenovirus 9 E4-ORF1 protein (8, 9), and the high-risk HPV E6 proteins (5, 6, 12-14). The commonality of binding to oncogenic virus proteins indicates that the PDZ proteins represent conserved pathways that are subverted during oncogenic transformation. The hDlg protein contains three PDZ domains which have been evaluated separately for their ability to bind diverse recognition sequences including those from HPV E6 (5), adenovirus E4 ORF1 (6), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)

hDlg/SAP97 PDZ2 in Complex with HPV-18 E6 Peptide

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 38, 2007 10865

FIGURE 1: Domain representations of hDlg/SAP97 and HPV-18 E6 proteins. The hDlg protein has an L27 domain at its N-terminus, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, three PDZ domains (PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3), an SH3 domain, and a C-terminal region with homology to GTP kinases (74). The E6 protein has two zinc-binding domains (ZN1 and ZN2) and a PDZ-binding motif (PDZB). The PDZ-binding motif, RRETQV, is shown and numbered relative to the last residue below the amino acid sequence.

(17), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2 B unit (NR2B) (18). In general, the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) appears to have the strongest affinity, whereas PDZ1 has weaker affinity and PDZ3 shows even less binding (5, 6, 17-19). The presence of the PDZ-binding motif in the E6 protein of the high-risk HPV types, but not low-risk HPV types, suggests a role in HPV-induced oncogenesis (6, 21). Some HPV E6 proteins that have mutations at the C-terminus lose the ability to bind PDZ domain proteins but retain the ability to inactivate p53, indicating that E6 contributes to cancer through disruption of two cellular pathways, one of which is mediated through interaction with PDZ domain partners and the other through the inactivation of p53 (22). The canonical binding mode of class I PDZ interactors (which have the sequence -x-S/T-x-, where  is a hydrophobic amino acid) predicts that high-risk HPV E6 proteins bind to PDZ-containing proteins using only the last four residues in their carboxyl termini (x-S/T-x-V/L) (20). Analysis of the C-termini of E6 proteins of high-risk HPV types shows a conserved consensus protein kinase A (PKA) recognition site (Rxx[S/T] or Rx[S/T]) that overlaps with the PDZ-binding motif (except in HPV-73). In the case of HPV-18 E6, the sequence is R153-R154-E155-T156-Q157-V158 (Figure 1). The PKA site does not overlap with the predicted PDZ-binding motifs in E6 of "probable" high-risk HPV types (HPV-26, -53, and -66), and does not occur in other virus proteins (8, 9, 16, 18, 23). Thr156 at the p-2 position of HPV-18 E6 is critical for in Vitro binding to hDlg, as mutation to either other neutral or acidic amino acids abolishes binding (13). Stimulation of PKA activity inhibits HPV-18 E6-induced degradation of hDlg, but not of p53 (24), and the mutation of the conserved arginine at the p-5 position abrogates PKA's negative regulation (25). In the absence of structural data, how HPV E6 proteins bind to the hDlg PDZ domain is not clear, particularly the roles of the two highly conserved Arg residues of E6 in the complex. Structures for each of the PDZ domains of hDlg in the absence of HPV E6 have been reported. They include the NMR structure of the first PDZ domain in complex with NR2B peptide (18), the crystal structures of the second PDZ domain unbound and bound to a peptide from the GluR-A protein (26), and the crystal structure of the third PDZ

domain alone (27). Structures of hDlg PDZ2 homologues unbound to peptides have also been reported (28). The observed structures show a typical PDZ architecture, and contain six -strands and two R-helices (27, 29-31). The C-terminal three or four residues of target proteins form a short strand that binds in a groove formed by the long R-helix and the second -strand and antiparallel to the strand (29, 31). To investigate the binding mechanism between hDlg and HPV E6 protein in solution, we determined the NMR structure of hDlg PDZ2 in complex with the C-terminus sequence of high-risk HPV E6. The structure of the complex reveals the interface of hDlg PDZ2 domain binding to E6 protein, which provides a platform for understanding the molecular basis of the binding specificity between hDlg PDZ domains and HPV E6. A novel binding mode for PDZpeptide recognition was found in which the C-terminal six amino acids of HPV E6 were in contact with the PDZ domain. Our solution experiments also provide dynamic information associated with binding. In the final stages of preparation of this manuscript, crystal structures of three PDZ domains each in complex with a seven amino acid peptide from HPV-18 E6 were independently reported (32). Combining our solution structure, chemical exchange measurements, and titration experiments with the crystallographic study provides a more accurate picture of the binding mechanism between hDlg PDZ domains and HPV E6 and includes the roles of particular amino acids used for binding and in dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification. The DNA encoding the second PDZ domain of human hDlg (residues 318-405) was cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET30a(+) vector. The protein construct contained an additional N-terminal methionine and a C-terminal glycineserine linker connecting to a hexahistidine tag. The transformed BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C to OD600 of 0.8 before induction with 0.4 mM isopropyl 1-thio- -Dgalactopyranoside overnight. Isotopically enriched (15N, 13C, and 15N/13C) samples were prepared by growing cells in

10866 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 38, 2007 modified M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl and/or [13C]glucose and the corresponding Celtone (1 g/L) (33). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the protein was purified with a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by elution with 100 mM imidazole (pH 8.0). The protein was further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G75 in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5). The pooled fractions were concentrated to 2 mM, aliquoted, and lyophilized. A sample for NMR was prepared by redissolving a lyophilized aliquot and rechecking its pH value. Peptide Design. Four peptides containing the C-terminus of HPV-18 E6 sequence (acetyl-RRETQV-[COOH], hereafter called E6CT), the C-terminus of HPV-16 E6 sequence (acetyl-RRETQL-[COOH], E6CT0L), the Thr156-phosphorylated C-terminus of HPV-18 E6 (acetyl-RREpTQV[COOH], E6CT2p), and an Arg154Gly mutant peptide (acetyl-RGETQV-[COOH], E6CT4G) were designed to investigate the roles of particular amino acid residues in binding. Peptides were synthesized using FMOC chemistry and purified by C18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Identities were confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC system (MicroCal) at 20 °C in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Proteins were dialyzed against buffer, centrifuged, and degassed before the experiment. Typically, a 200 µM peptide solution was injected 30 times in 10 µL aliquots into the 1.4 mL sample cell containing hDlg PDZ2 domain at a concentration of 10 µM. For E6CT0L, the PDZ2 and peptide concentrations were adjusted to 50 µM and 1.0 mM, respectively. Data were fit with a nonlinear least-squares routine using a single-site binding model with Origin for ITC v.7.0 (Microcal), varying the stoichiometry (n), the enthalpy of the reaction (H), and the association constant (Ka). NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR experiments were acquired at 20 °C on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer. Uniformly 15 N-labeled PDZ2 domain (0.33 mM) was titrated with E6CT peptide from 10 mM stocks. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected at peptide:protein molar ratios of between 0 and 4.5. Residues for which the intensity remained strong throughout the titration were classified as being in fast exchange if they showed a continuous chemical shift change and in slow exchange if they showed only either the unbound resonance or the bound resonance. Other residues for which the intensity disappeared during the midpoint of the titration were designated as being in intermediate exchange. For residues in fast exchange, the observed chemical shift change was fitted using the following equation (34):

Liu et al. For structure determination, samples were about 2 mM in 20 mM phosphate (pH 6.5) and 4 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Resonance assignments and NOE analyses were performed on a 15N,13C protein sample using a suite of pulsed-field gradient-enhanced NMR experiments as described (35, 36). Briefly, resonance assignment was carried out using standard homonuclear 2D NMR experiments and a series of double- and triple-resonance experiments, including 2D 1H,15N-HSQC and 1H,13C-HSQC, 3D 1H,15N TOCSYHSQC and NOESY-HSQC, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, CBCACONH, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra (37-42). 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings were measured in C8E5/n-octanol alignment media (43), using a molar ratio of C8E5/n-octanol of 0.87 and a C8E5/water ratio of 5 wt %, in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) with 10% D2O. Samples using 10 to 15 mg/mL of filamentous bacteriophage Pf1 as the alignment medium had poor spectral quality and were not analyzed further. Stereospecific assignments of valine and leucine methyl groups were obtained from a constant-time (CT) 1H-13C HSQC spectrum acquired on a 10% 13C-labeled sample (44, 45). To obtain unambiguous intermolecular NOEs, a 2D 13C-filtered,13C,15N-filtered NOESY spectrum was recorded (46). All data were processed with Bruker XWINNMR. SPARKY was used for resonance assignment and to measure NOE cross-peak intensities (47). Conformational Data and Structure Calculations. NOEs for structure calculation were measured from a 2D NOESY spectrum collected in D2O and from a 3D 1H-15N-NOESYHSQC spectrum in H2O using a mixing time of 100 ms. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived from the secondary structure of the protein and the backbone chemical shift analysis program TALOS (48). For amide protons protected from exchange with D2O (Table S1), hydrogen bond restraints were set with 1.6 Å < dNH-O < 2.4 Å and 2.4 Å < dN-O < 3.5 Å using the acceptor identified from initial rounds of structure calculation. Structures were calculated using the CNS program (version 1.1) (49) as described (50). The NOE/hydrogen bond and dihedral constraints used the default force constants (75 kcal/Å2 and 400 kcal/deg2, respectively). The Erepel function was replaced by a Lennard-Jones potential during the final Powell minimization. Ten initial structures of the complex were calculated without the residual dipolar coupling restraints. Alignment tensor parameters (Da and R) were determined using PALES (51). The residual dipolar coupling restraints were incorporated into the final calculation with a force scale from 0.1 to 50 in Cartesian space. The resulting 30 structures were validated by PROCHECK (52) and WHATIF (53) programs. Structural statistics were performed with PROCHECK (52). Hydrogen bonds were identified if present in the majority of calculated structures. Structures were compared by using ESCET scripts (54). Molecular Dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the parallel molecular dynamics program NAMD (55) using the CHARMM22 force field (56). The mean structure of the 30 calculated NMR structures was generated for a starting point. After placing the structure inside a water sphere, solvent molecules were relaxed by using 1000 steps of energy minimization at 310 K. Minimized coordinates were then used for 20 ps molecular dynamics (MD) runs at 278, 310, 380, and 450 K, respectively. The electrostatic interaction between 1 and 4 atoms

was taken into account. A cutoff of 12 Å was set for electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, and switching was turned on using a switching distance of 8 Å and a pair list distance of 13.5 Å. Equations of motion were integrated every 2 fs. Finally, 5 ps simulations were run without constraints to complete the minimization and equilibration of the structures in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble at 300 K and 1 atm. Langevin dynamics were used to control the temperature with the dampening coefficient set to 5 ps-1, and just applied to the heavy atoms. Periodic boundary conditions were applied and full-system periodic electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method (57-59). A cutoff of 12 Å was set, and switching was turned on using a switching distance of 10 Å and a pair list distance of 13.5 Å. The final coordinates for each run were displayed and analyzed by VMD (60) and PROCHECK (52) and were superimposed by using the MOLMOL program (61). RESULTS Characterization of the Binding of an HPV E6 C-Terminal Peptide to the hDlg PDZ2 Domain. In an NMR titration experiment using 15N-labeled-hDlg PDZ2 domain, the addition of a hexapeptide derived from the C-terminal sequence of HPV-18E6 (E6CT) induced substantial chemical shift changes in a subset of cross-peaks of the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum (Figure 2A). Some peaks showed continuous changes in chemical shift as peptide was added (fast exchange), while some showed discontinuous changes with high intensity throughout the titration (slow exchange) or disappeared at the midpoint of the titration (intermediate exchange). As expected, large chemical shift changes were associated with peaks in slow chemical exchange, and small changes with peaks in fast exchange (Table S1, Supporting Information) (34, 62). The chemical shift changes of residues in fast exchange (e.g.,

Gly327 and Lys351; Figure 2B and 2C) Versus peptide concentration were fitted to eq 1 and generated an equilibrium dissociation constant of about 5.0 µM (Figure 1S, Supporting Information). The binding of the parent peptide and a series of mutant peptides to hDlg PDZ2 was also measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Table 1) and by NMR. All peptides that bound showed negative enthalpy changes (H) varying from -7 to -10 kcal/mol, and small unfavorable entropy changes (TS) varying from 0 to -2 kcal/mol, indicating that binding is enthalpy-dominated. The wild-type HPV-18 E6 peptide, E6CT, yielded a dissociation constant of 1.3 ( 0.1 µM (corresponding to a G value of -8.1 kcal/ mol) with the predicted stoichiometry of 1.0:1.0 (Figure 2D). These results are consistent with those observed for other PDZ domain/target peptide interactions which have dissociation constants in the range of 1 to 10 µM (63, 64). E6CT4G peptide, in which Arg154 was replaced by glycine, bound PDZ2 with a Kd value of 5.2 ( 0.8 µM (G of -7.1 kcal/ mol), which was around 4-fold weaker than E6CT. The energy contribution (G) for binding PDZ2 from the sidechain contact made by Arg154 appears to be roughly 1 kcal/ mol. E6CT0L peptide, in which the C-terminal valine

was replaced by leucine, bound PDZ2 about 5-fold weaker than E6CT, with a dissociation constant of 6.5 ( 0.8 µM (G ) -7.0 kcal/mol). The binding energy difference shows that valine at position 0 is about 1.1 kcal/mol more favorable for binding than leucine. E6CT2p, which was phosphorylated at Thr156, did not evolve heat on addition to PDZ2 in the ITC experiment, consistent with an inability to bind and indicating the crucial requirement of having unphosphorylated threonine at position -2 for interaction. To determine whether E6CT0L and E6CT4G bound to similar binding sites as E6CT, chemical shift changes were examined and found to be similar. The addition of E6CT2p yielded only small chemical shift changes at high peptide to PDZ domain ratios, indicating greatly reduced binding. Three-Dimensional Structure of the hDlg PDZ2 Domain in Complex with the E6CT Peptide. We determined the 3D structure of the hDlg PDZ2 domain in complex with E6CT peptide using solution NMR spectroscopy. Samples containing 15N-labeled or 15N,13C-labeled hDlg PDZ2 domain and unlabeled E6CT peptide were used for resonance and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) assignments. We carried out the backbone and side-chain assignments using standard methods (41, 42). Except for the first residue (Met317), a residue located in a loop (Asn375), the three proline residues (Pro325, Pro341, and Pro404), and part of the His6 tag, the backbone assignments were 100% completed. Except for Leu321, Leu371, and Val 373, whose two methyl groups could not be distinguished, the methyl groups from other six leucine residues and seven valine residues were stereospecifically assigned. Using NOE cross-peaks from the 2D 15N,13C-filtered spectrum of 15N,13C-labeled hDlg PDZ2 in complex with unlabeled E6CT in H2O as a basis set, intermolecular NOEs could be distinguished from intramolecular ones by comparing the spectra of overlaid 2D NOESY and TOCSY spectra of the unlabeled and unfiltered hDlg PDZ2/E6CT complex in D2O (Figures 3 and S2, Supporting Information). This comparison was also used to analyze NOEs in the 3D 15Nseparated NOESY-HSQC. These data allowed us to assign 71 intermolecular NOEs between the E6CT peptide and the hDlg PDZ2 domain. Per residue, the numbers of intermolecular NOEs were 6 for residue R-5, 3 for R-4, 12 for E-3, 10 for T-2, 11 for Q-1 and 29 for V0. Structures of hDlg PDZ domain in complex with E6CT peptide were calculated using a final total of 1176 restraints (1126 NOEs and 25 hydrogen bonds), 163 dihedral restraints,

and 87 1JNH residual dipolar couplings. A ribbon diagram of a representative structure and a backbone superposition of 30 structures are shown in Figure 4. Over 98% of residues had favored phi-psi torsion angles by PROCHECK analysis (Table 2), and therefore the structure is of high quality. The total energies are about -203 kcal/mol, and the backbone rms deviation of superimposed structures is 0.46 ( 0.11 Å. To explore a greater range of motions than those exhibited by the NMR structures, simple molecular dynamic simulations were performed. The results with a variety of different molecular dynamic conditions showed that the conformations of residues V0, Q-1, and T-2 as well as the major structural elements of PDZ2 were the same as in the NMR structures (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Residues E-3, R-4, and R-5 in E6CT and loop 2 in PDZ2 showed alternative conformations, suggesting flexibility in the molecular contact between the N-terminal end of the peptide and the domain. The solution structure of hDlg PDZ2 possesses a typical PDZ domain fold topology with six -strands ( A to F) and two R-helices (RA and RB) (Figure 4A) and is consistent with the crystal structures of the unliganded domain (26) and that bound to HPV-18 E6 peptide (32), with the rms deviation of the backbone atoms of superimposed secondary structure elements of about 0.9 Å. The difference is unlikely to be significant considering crystal packing artifacts and different crystallization conditions (65) and the uncertainty in the NMR coordinates (about 0.5 Å). The peptide docks to a positively charged groove between B and RB, and forms a strand ( G) that is antiparallel to B. The two methyl groups of the valine residue at the p0 position of E6CT are located in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the hydrophobic side chains of Leu328, Phe330, and Ile332 from the B sheet and Ala386, Val387, Ala389, and Leu390 from the RB helix. The amide hydrogen of V0 forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl O of Phe330, and one of the terminal carboxylates is recognized by hydrogen bonds to the HN from Leu328, Gly329, and Phe330 (Figure 4C). The two hydrophilic residues (glutamine at the p-1 position and threonine at the p-2 position) are in two shallow pockets and partly exposed to solvent, with two hydrogen bonds forming between T-2 and Ile332 (T-2HN/Ile332O and T-2O/ Ile332HN). The negatively charged glutamate at the p-3 position is near a positive patch on the PDZ2 domain, and thus likely interacts with the PDZ2 domain through electrostatic interactions with His340 as well as a hydrogen bond suggested by NMR and MD simulations (E-3O /Thr350H).

The corresponding secondary structures are A, B, C, RA, D, E, RB, F in PDZ2 and G in the peptide ligand.

Arginine at the p-4 position forms hydrogen bonds with Asn338 and Gly334 (R-4HN/Asn338O and R-4O/Asn338H and R-4O/Gly334HN). MD simulations suggest an interaction between the side chain H of R-4 and the side chain O of Asn338. Although this arginine is near a positively charged area of the PDZ2 domain, intermolecular NOEs between R-4 and His383 indicated that the relatively poorly defined side chain of R-4 extends toward Glu384, potentially forming a salt bridge which would lessen an otherwise

disadvantageous electrostatic interaction. Thus Gly334 and Asn338 within loop 2 and Glu384 in RB are important for R-4 binding. The arginine at the p-5 position extends away from the PDZ2 domain, and avoids a potentially disadvantageous electrostatic interaction associated with the positively charged surface of the peptide-binding region of the domain. MD simulations showed a potential hydrogen bond between the side chain of R-5(H11) and His340N, consistent with NOEs observed by NMR. The residues in loop 2 (Gly334, Asn338, and His340) of PDZ2 thus form a binding motif for R-5, R-4, and E-3 of E6CT that has not been previously reported for other PDZ domains. The chemical shift perturbations of PDZ2 residues on binding E6CT were examined in detail to refine the binding model suggested by the structure. The residues displaying large chemical shift changes ( > 0.15 ppm) mapped to one face of the domain structure (Figure 5). Generally, the buried residues contacting the peptide displayed large chemical shift changes and slow exchange rates. These include Leu328, Gly329, Ala389, and Leu390 of the hydrophobic pocket of PDZ2 that are close to V0 in E6CT and residues Thr350, His383, and Ile353 that are close to residues E-3, T-2, and Q-1, respectively. The residues not participating in binding and exposed to solvent displayed either small or no chemical shift changes and fast exchange rates. The residues possessing strong contacts to the peptide but exposed to solvent displayed medium chemical shift changes and intermediate exchange rates. The NMR chemical shift changes for residues showing fast exchange at the periphery of the binding site (residues Gly327, Lys351, Thr393, and Phe396) were suitable for analysis, and yielded an average equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 5 µM. These residues, which do not directly contact the bound E6CT peptide, appeared to show weaker binding affinities than that measured globally using isothermal titration calorimetry (Kd  1 µM). The difference may not be significant, reflecting the different protein concentrations used in the two experiments, but may also indicate a multistate binding phenomenon in which the residues directly contacting the bound E6CT peptide bind

with higher affinity, consistent with previous observations of SH2 binding to phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (66). DISCUSSION Comparison of Closely Related PDZ Domain Structures Binding to Different Peptides. The crystal structure of the second PDZ domain of hDlg alone and in complex with a peptide from the C-terminus of GluR-A (Ala904-Thr905-Gly906Leu907) was recently determined (26). Because the complex is a dimer showing two PDZ domains in the asymmetric unit with different resolution, the chain with best resolution (chain A) was selected for analysis. To examine the conformation changes in hDlg PDZ2 that occur in the B and RB secondary elements that are in closest contact to the peptide, the other secondary structural elements ( A, C F, and RA) were superimposed (Figure 6). Although the overall structures are similar (rms deviation of superimposed backbone atoms of 1 Å), significant differences appear to arise from ligand-induced conformational changes. The changes may arise from crystal packing forces which can induce up to 1 Å changes in loop conformations (65). In particular, in the PDZ2/GluR-A complex (and in the crystal structure of the PDZ2/E6CT complex), crystal contacts were found to involve loop 2. In the PDZ2/GluR-A complex, the C-terminus of RB moves away from the B sheet, consistent with an interpretation that the movement facilitates accommodation of the peptide (26, 67), whereas in the PDZ2/E6CT complex, the C-terminus of RB is closer to B, making the structure more compact. Conformational differences may arise from differences in the size of the p0 residue which is leucine in PDZ2/GluR-A and the smaller valine in PDZ2/ E6CT. Examination of the potential surfaces shows that the hydrophobic pocket that surrounds valine in PDZ2/E6CT is smaller than the corresponding pockets in PDZ2/GluR-A and

To compare changes in the secondary elements that contact the peptide ligand ( B and RB), backbone atoms were superimposed using the remaining secondary structural elements and loops.

PDZ2 alone. Differences in the center of the distance difference matrix (DDM) confirm that the core structure of PDZ2/E6CT is more compact than PDZ2/GluR-A (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The suitability of valine over leucine at the p0 position suggested by the structures is consistent with the ITC measurements showing stronger binding to the valine-containing peptide (Table 1). Such structural and energetic comparisons explain the higher

affinity of HPV-18 E6 over HPV-16 E6 for binding hDlg PDZ2, which had been demonstrated qualitatively by GSTpulldown assays (12). The only difference in their PDZbinding motifs is the p0 residue, which is leucine in HPV16 E6 and valine in HPV-18 E6. The crystal structure of hDlg PDZ2/GluR-A showed that B of PDZ2 interacts at positions p0 and p-2 of the bound peptide through main chain hydrogen bonds, consistent with a "classical" type I PDZ interaction (20, 26, 63, 64). The high-risk HPV E6 proteins contain not only the highly conserved E-3-T-2-Q-1-V0 sequence but also two additionally conserved arginine residues at the p-4 and p-5 positions. As a consequence of more extensive engagement of residues of PDZ2 in contacting E6CT than when contacting GluR-A, differences in conformation arise, resulting in an rms deviation of superimposed backbone atoms of 1.7 Å. In PDZ2/E6CT, there is van der Waals contact between Q-1 and Ile353 (Figure 5), which is absent in PDZ2/GluR-A. The hydrogen bond between R-4HN and Asn338O in PDZ2/ E6CT is absent in PDZ2/GluR-A. Another major difference between PDZ2/E6CT and PDZ2/GluR-A is in loop 2, which is more packed and closer to the C-terminus of the B sheet in the PDZ2/E6CT complex than in PDZ2/GluR-A (26). The additional contacts observed in the hDlg PDZ2/E6CT complex may provide the driving force for the more compact nature of its structure and the more rigid conformation of its loop 2 than in the other PDZ domains. A large number of NOEs between His383 in the first position of helix RB and residues Ile332/Ala333/Gly334 in the B strand and Asn338 in loop 2 demonstrate significant interaction between the N-terminus of RB and the C-terminus of B/loop2. In the unliganded hDlg PDZ2 crystal structure, four hydrogen bonds were observed involving loop 2 (Asn338 HN/ Gly335O, Asp344 HN/Ile341O, Gly343HN/Gln339O 1, and Ser346HN/Asp344O1). In the PDZ2/GluR-A complex, three additional hydrogen bonds (Gly334HN/Asn338O, Asn338H21/Gly334O, and Asn339H 21/Asn345O1, respectively) are generated. In the PDZ2/E6CT complex, two more hydrogen bonds are present, Gly335HN/Asn345O and one between RB and loop 2 through His383H1/Gly334O. The extensive contacts of R-4 and R-5 in E6CT with loop 2 appear to slide the peptide in the groove between B and RB toward loop 2. Consequently, the contacts made from loop 2 to His383 in RB pull the C-terminus of the helix to reorient inside and make the PDZ2 domain more compact.

Comparison of Different PDZ Domain Structures Binding to Similar Target Peptide Sequences. The PDZ domain of SNA1 (R-1-syntrophin) recognizes five C-terminal residues of the R-subunit of the vertebrate voltage-gated sodium channel with a hydrophobic residue at p0, a S/T residue at p-2, an E at p-3, and R/K at p-4 with a dissociation constant of 2.1 µM (64, 68). The similarity of its recognition sequence to the extended C-terminal recognition sequences in highrisk HPV E6 proteins and the comparable binding affinities suggests similar molecular interactions. Comparison of the hDlg PDZ2/E6CT structure with the NMR structure of the PDZ domain of SNA1 in complex with a peptide G-6-V-5K-4-E-3-S-2-L-1-V0 (68) shows that the residues interacting with V0 are very similar in terms of van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds. In PDZ2/E6CT, Ile353 is in van der Waals contact with Q-1, whereas in the SNA1 PDZ complex, the equivalent residue is Phe34, which contacts L-1. The hDlg PDZ2 Ile332 contacts T-2 of E6CT through two mainchain hydrogen bonds (T-2O/Ile332HN and T-2HN/Ile332O); the corresponding contacts in the SNA1-PDZ complex are S-2HN/Ile18O and potentially S-2OH/His64N . Similar interactions are also made in both complexes in contacting the glutamate residue at the p-3 position. SNA1 PDZ and hDlg PDZ2 differ in their contacts to residues in the p-4 and p-5 position of the peptide. Although both contact arginine (or lysine) at the p-4 position, specificity is provided by different residues, mostly as a consequence of loop 2 being five amino acids shorter in SNA1-PDZ. Three key residues of hDlg PDZ2 are used to select arginine at the p-4 position (Gly334 and Asn338 of loop2 and Glu384 of RB). The Asp65 of SNA1-PDZ, which is equivalent to Glu384 in hDlg PDZ2, is the only contact to provide specificity for the p-4 position. In SNA1-PDZ, Gly20 (the equivalent of Gly334) contacts a histidine in RB within the domain, whereas in hDlg PDZ2 the residue hydrogen bonds with Asn338 within loop 2 that contacts R-4. Asn24 in SNA1 PDZ, equivalent to Asn338 in hDlg PDZ2, is too far away to interact with K-4. The hDlg PDZ2 domain shows specificity for arginine at the -5 position using His340, whereas SNA1 PDZ does not have residues in loop 2 that could carry out similar interactions, and therefore it does not show specificity at the -5 position. Because the syntrophin SNA1 PDZ domain binds to a sequence that is at the C-terminus of HPV E6 proteins, we predict that HPV E6 targets syntrophin SNA1 in addition to

10872 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 38, 2007 the seven PDZ domain-containing proteins that have been reported (69). Syntrophins are scaffold proteins of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex that targets ion channels, receptors, and signaling proteins to specialized subcellular domains (70). The PDZ domain of syntrophins serves as an adaptor for recruiting membrane channels, receptors, kinases, and other signaling proteins (71). It is possible then that HPV E6 affects the biological functions of SNA1. hDlg PDZ2 Binds E6 with Highest Affinity Compared to hDlg PDZ1 and PDZ3. The structures of the three PDZ domains of hDlg have been determined in the unliganded state (18, 26, 27), the solution structure of hDlg PDZ2 in complex with E6CT is described in the present work, and the structures of the domains in complex with a peptide similar to E6CT have been solved using X-ray crystallography (32). These structures allow us to provide a molecular explanation for why hDlg PDZ2 has been found to be a good domain for binding HPV E6 compared to the hDlg PDZ1 and PDZ3 domains (5, 6, 18, 19). The sequences of the three PDZ domains are shown in Figure 7. Gly334, Asn338, and His340 in loop 2 and Glu384 in RB of PDZ2 make contact to E6CT at R-4 and R-5, whereas in PDZ1, the corresponding residues are Gly, Asn, His, and Ser. Most of the critical residues of hDlg PDZ2 needed for binding R-4 and R-5 are also present in PDZ1, suggesting that PDZ1 could bind to E6CT in a similar manner. Because the side chain of Ser290 in PDZ1 is neutral and short, it cannot contact R-4 in the same manner as the long, negatively charged side chain of Glu384 in PDZ2. However, residues in loop 2 and a threonine and lysine in C are in the correct position to contact E-3, thus allowing PDZ1 to still bind HPV E6. In addition, instead of a glutamine at residue 339 in PDZ2, the corresponding residue in PDZ1 is proline (residue 245), which sits between the two key residues, Asn244 and His246, that potentially contact the arginines at p-4 and p-5. It appears that the presence of proline in the loop distorts the conformation and reduces the binding of PDZ1 to HPV E6 protein relative to PDZ2. In a study that examined binding to the protein NR2B, mutation of this proline to glutamine led to a 2-fold increase in affinity (18). In PDZ3, the residues corresponding to loop 2 of PDZ2 are 6 amino acids shorter, and therefore it does not contain the crucial residues for the contacts to R-4 and R-5 residues, thus explaining its greatly decreased ability to bind E6. Analysis of the crystal structures suggests an alternative model for weak PDZ3 binding in which Leu494 and Asn478 sterically prevent contact to Q-1 (32). Although in SNA1 PDZ, hDlg PDZ1, and PDZ2 domains, the residues corresponding to Leu494 in PDZ3 are the equally large Phe or Ile residues (Figure 7), they still bind peptide targets with high affinity. Mutational analysis of E6 peptides and PDZ3 domains could be used to investigate the relative contributions of changes in contacts to the -1 position of bound peptide versus a model which invokes changes in contacts to the -4 and -5 positions. Interestingly, high-risk HPV E6 binds both the central, DNA-binding domain of p53 (72) and hDlg (73). We speculate that the hDlg-E6-E6AP triple complex has features similar to the p53-E6-E6AP complex as they both experience ubiquitin-mediated degradation processes. The part of E6 that binds E6AP (or another ubiquitin ligase) possibly possesses the same molecular surface in both hDlgE6 and p53-E6 complexes. Thus this structure investigation

Liu et al. of HPV E6 with hDlg provides a model to understand the binding and subsequent degradation of both p53 and PDZcontaining target proteins.
