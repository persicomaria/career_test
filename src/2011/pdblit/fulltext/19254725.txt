The tripartite efflux pump MacAB­TolC found in Gram-negative bacteria is involved in resistance to antibiotics. We previously reported the funnel-like hexameric structure of the adaptor protein MacA to be physiologically relevant. In this study, we investigated the role of the tip region of its a-hairpin, which forms a cogwheel structure in the funnel-like shape of the MacA hexamer. Mutational and biochemical analyses revealed that the conserved residues located at the tip region of the a-hairpin of MacA play an essential role in the binding of TolC. Our findings offer a molecular basis for understanding the drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria. Ó 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The tripartite efflux pumps of Gram-negative bacteria have been implicated in the intrinsic drug resistance and toxin secretion of pathogenic bacteria [1­4]. Diverse xenobiotic or protein toxins are selectively pumped out to the external medium depending on the tripartite efflux pumps [2,5]. These pumps typically consist of three essential components. An inner membrane transporter (IMT) provides energy for the transport of substrates [6] and an outer membrane factor (OMF) connects with IMT in the periplasm, providing a continuous conduit to the external medium [6,7]. The third essential component is an adapter protein called a membrane fusion protein (MFP) that connects the IMT to the OMF in the periplasm [5]. The crystal structure of MFPs reveals them to consist of a membrane proximal domain, b-barrel domain, lipoyl domain, and a-hairpin domain [8­12]. Structural and functional results suggest that the a-hairpin domain of MFP is involved in interactions with TolC [8,13]. MacAB­TolC, identified as a macrolide-specific extrusion pump [14], has also been implicated in enterotoxin secretion by Escherichia coli [15]. IMT-MacB is an ABC transporter that uses ATP hydrolysis as its driving force [14] and is characterized as a homodimeric protein [16]. MFP-MacA connects MacB to TolC and shares a high sequence similarity with AcrA and MexA, both of

which are associated with the resistance nodulation cell divisiontype transporters that are structurally distinct from MacB [5]. In our previous work, we suggested that the funnel-like hexameric structure of MacA is physiologically relevant using structural, biochemical, and genetic approaches [9]. The crystal structure of MacA suggest a `MacA-bridging model' in which MacA directly contacts TolC in a tip-to-tip manner intervening between TolC and MacB [9,17]. In this study, we investigate the role of the tip region of the a-hairpin of MacA in support of the idea of tipto-tip binding between MacA and TolC. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Strains and plasmids The construction of the acrAB deleted E. coli strain BW25113, DacrAB, has been previously described [9]. To construct pMacAB1-R131A, -L135D, -S142D, and R131A/L135D, DNA fragments encoding mutant MacA proteins were created using the overlap extension PCR method. The resulting PCR DNA was digested with EcoRI and HpaI and ligated into the same sites in pMacAB1. The outside primers used were MacA-F (50 -ATCATATGAAAAAGCGGA AAACCGT) and MacAY275A-R (50 -GAAAATAGCGTCGTTAACCT). The mutagenic primers used were MacA-R131A-R (50 -ACGTTGCTG CGCGGAATACGTCACCCGCGCCA; mutated nucleotides in bold) and MacA-R131A-F (50 -ACGTATTCCGCGCAGCAACGTCTGGCACAAACG; mutated nucleotides in bold) for MacA-R131A, MacA-L135D-R (50 -ATCACGTTGCTGACGGGAATACG; mutated nucleotides in bold) and MacA-L135D-F (50 -TTCCCGTCAGCAACGTGATGCACAAACGAA

Over-expression and purification of recombinant proteins The expression and purification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans MacA (Aa MacA) and E. coli MacA have been previously described [9,18]. The substitution mutants Aa MacA and E. coli MacA proteins were generated by the QuikChange method (Invitrogen). 2.3. In vitro binding assay The recombinant proteins of hexahistidine-tagged Aa MacA (wild type and mutants) and the GST-fused Aa TolC periplasmic region were expressed and purified as previously described [17]. Ten microliters of glutathione resin, bound to the GST-fused Aa TolC protein or resin alone, were incubated with Aa MacA (wild type or mutants) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed with 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and it was then eluted with the same buffer

supplemented with 20 mM glutathione. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS­PAGE, and the protein bands were stained with Coomassie blue. 2.4. Measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) The measurement of MIC has been previously described [9]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. The conserved residues of the MacA a-hairpin tip region are functionally important In the funnel-like hexameric structure of MacA, the end of the funnel mouth exhibits a cogwheel-shaped a-barrel composed of six a-hairpin tip regions (Fig. 1A) [9]. This six-membered cogwheel of the a-barrel suggests that the a-hairpin tip region may pertain to the binding to TolC (Fig. 1A) [9]. To examine the functional importance of the a-hairpin tip region of MacA, three of the strictly conserved residues found in all subfamilies of MFPs (Arg131, Leu135, and Ser142 in the E. coli MacA) (Fig. 1) were mutated, and the resulting MacA mutants were tested for their ability to form a functional drug efflux pump. For this experiment, an E. coli strain with deleted acrAB genes (BW25113DacrAB) was used, as the function of MacAB­TolC can be easily measured in the absence of the major multidrug resistance gene acrAB [14,19,20].

The degree of resistance of the E. coli strain BW25113DacrAB-expressing MacA mutant to erythromycin is shown as MIC (lg/ml). Expression levels of MacA and MacB are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.

shown in Table 1, the expression of all MacA mutants containing amino acid substitutions did not complement the function of wild-type MacA. These results indicate that the conserved residues, which are located in the tip region of the MFP a-hairpin, play a crucial role in the function of MacA in vivo. The structural integrity of the E. coli MacA mutants was confirmed by the circular dichroism spectroscopy with the corresponding recombinant proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2). 3.2. The invariant residues at the MacA a-hairpin play an important role in the TolC binding To examine the involvement of these conserved residues in TolC binding, we employed an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins with the periplasmic domains of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans MacA protein (Aa MacA) and its cognate OMFTdeA (Aa TolC). The structural integrity and homotrimeric property of the periplasmic domain of Aa TolC was previously confirmed [21]. Aa MacA intrinsically forms a hexamer, and it has been reported to interact with the periplasmic region of Aa TolC in vitro [17,21]. To examine the role of the conserved residues at the ahelical tip of MacA, Arg128, Leu132, and Ser139 of Aa MacA, which correspond to Arg131, Leu135, and Ser142 of E. coli MacA, respectively, were mutated. All of the mutant proteins were eluted as hexamers in solution (data not shown), confirming that the conserved residues at the a-hairpin tip region are not involved in the hexamerization of the protein. As shown in Fig. 2, no mutant MacA proteins bound to the GST-fused Aa TolC periplasmic domain, indicating that the conserved residues are essential for binding to TolC. Taken together, our results suggest that the a-hairpin tip region of MacA is functionally important through mediating the interaction with TolC. 3.3. A proposing assembly model for MacA and TolC In our previous report, a funnel-like hexameric structure of MacA was structurally and functionally feasible, and the `adapter

bridging model' for the MacAB­TolC pump was proposed based on the structural complementarities between the periplasmic end regions of MacA and TolC [9]. A key feature of the adapter bridging model is the tip-to-tip binding between MacA and TolC. In this study, we demonstrated that the hairpin tip region of MacA plays an important role in its binding to TolC in vitro and in in vivo drug resistance. Since the hairpin tip regions are located on the sixmembered cogwheel structure of the funnel-like MacA hexamer, our present results indicate that MacA uses the cogwheel as a contacting interface with TolC. Because a TolC protomer has two units of a-hairpins in its periplasmic domain, the homotrimer TolC should have a six-membered cogwheel structure at the end of its a-barrel when the TolC central channel is open, which is similar to the end of the a-barrel of the MacA hexamer. Thus, our finding supports that MacA interacts with TolC in a tip-to-tip manner intermeshing the two cogwheels (Fig. 3) [9,17]. In this putative docking model, the cogwheel-to-cogwheel interaction between the MacA and TolC a-barrels form a major binding interface, which is consistent with our results. AcrA and MacA are commonly associated with the OMF TolC, where their a-hairpins play an essential role in these interactions [5,22]. Since the residues important in TolC binding are also conserved in AcrA and other MFPs, our results suggest that AcrA and MacA may exhibit similar interactions with TolC. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether AcrA and MacA show the same contact-

Fig. 2. In vitro binding assay for the periplasmic regions of Aa TolC and wild-type or mutant Aa MacA. The GST-fused TolC periplasmic region (GST-TolC peri) was preincubated with glutathione-coupled agarose and washed to remove unbound proteins. Then wild-type or mutant MacA proteins (R128A, L132D, R128A/L132D, S139A, S139C, and S139D) were incubated with the GST-fused TolC bound resins or glutathione­agarose resin itself. Finally, the bound proteins were analyzed on a SDS­polyacrylamide gel. Positions of molecular markers (kDa) are shown on the left (M). Contaminant bands are indicated by #. The structural integrity of the periplasmic domain of Aa TolC has been previously confirmed [21]. No chemical cross-linker was used to augment the binding.

To construct the model for TolC in the open state, the a-helices of TolC (PDB entry: 1EK9) were moved outward by superposing the a-barrel of the E. coli MacA hexamer [9] as a reference. In the modeled structure, the a-barrel end of TolC has a channel diameter close to that of MacA because of the superposition. (B) The surface representations highlight the complementarity between the ends of the two proteins, which is reminiscent of cogwheels in mesh. TolC is shown in cyan, and MacA is shown in magenta.

ing interface with TolC. In the generally accepted models for the AcrAB-TolC pump, the AcrA hairpins surround the outside of the TolC a-barrel [5,8,13,23­25], which is distinct from the model depicted in Fig. 3. Further structural and functional studies are required to determine whether the interactions between MFPs and OMFs are similar or divergent. In this study, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence implicating the tip-to-tip interaction between MacA and TolC in the assembly of the functional tripartite efflux pump, which offers a structural basis for understanding the drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria.
