Key words: affinity chromatography, protein purification, SH3 domain, structural genomics, X-ray crystallography Abstract Small peptide tags are often fused to proteins to allow their affinity purification in high-throughput structure analysis schemes. To assess the compatibility of small peptide tags with protein crystallization and to examine if the tags alter the three-dimensional structure, the N-terminus of the chicken -spectrin SH3 domain was labeled with a His 6 tag and the C-terminus with a StrepII tag. The resulting protein, His 6-SH3-StrepII, consists of 83 amino-acid residues, 23 of which originate from the tags. His 6-SH3-StrepII is readily purified by dual affinity chromatography, has very similar biophysical characteristics as the untagged protein domain and crystallizes readily from a number of sparse-matrix screen conditions. The crystal structure analysis at 2.3 Å resolution proves native-like structure of His 6-SH3-StrepII and shows the entire His 6 tag and part of the StrepII tag to be disordered in the crystal. Obviously, the fused affinity tags did not interfere with crystallization and structure analysis and did not change the protein structure. From the extreme case of His 6-SH3-StrepII, where affinity tags represent 27% of the total fusion protein mass, we extrapolate that protein constructs with N- and C-terminal peptide tags may lend themselves to biophysical and structural investigations in high-throughput regimes. Abbreviations: SH3 domain ­ Src homology 3 domain; His 6-SH3-StrepII ­ -spectrin SH3 domain with N-terminal His 6 and C-terminal StrepII affinity tag; GST ­ glutathione S-transferase; MBP ­ maltose-binding protein; aa ­ amino acid(s); rms ­ root-mean-square; MC ­ metal-chelating. Introduction The recombinant production of milligram quantities of pure and biologically active samples is a prerequisite for protein structure analysis by both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. It is often the rate-limiting step in the structure-analysis process. The use of affinity tags N- and/or C-terminally fused to the protein chain significantly facilitates protein purification. Affinity tags allow purification schemes to be designed in a way that is largely independent of the physical properties of the protein under investigation, since the interaction of the fusion protein with chromatography resins is dictated by the tag and not the protein itself. This is of utmost importance in high-throughput protein structure analysis schemes as

pursued in structural genomics programs [1­7] and commercial settings [7­9], where many proteins are being purified in parallel and the design of purification procedures exploiting the biophysical peculiarities of individual proteins would not be feasible. One may discriminate between two types of affinity tags. Whole-protein tags (glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), etc.) are usually removed proteolytically before crystallization or NMR analysis, although there have been occasional reports on their beneficial effects on protein solubility and crystallizability [10]. Peptide tags (oligohistidine (e.g., His 6), Strep, Flag, etc.) may be either cleaved off or retained on the protein after purification and before structure analysis. In either case, the removal of the affinity tag by cleavage with a site-specific or site-preferential protease such as thrombin, enterokinase, etc. is an additional preparative step. Furthermore, additional residues originating from the cloning and processing procedure may be left attached N- or C-terminally to the purified protein. There is always concern that the cleavage may remain incomplete or that unwanted proteolysis may occur at susceptible sites of the target protein. For the recombinant production of human proteins in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris we are exploring a cloning strategy that produces proteins with an N-terminal His 6 tag and a C-terminal StrepII tag [11, 12]. Two different affinity tags are employed, since we have observed that the exclusive use of either one of them often results in incomplete purification necessitating further chromatography. Furthermore, a N-terminal tag may ensure proper translation initiation whereas an additional C-terminal tag allows for easy removal of incomplete translation products that will not bind to the cognate affinity resin. The subsequent structure analysis would be ideally performed in the presence of these tags to avoid the above-mentioned potential complications arising from proteolysis.

We are thus faced with the questions if (a) the affinity tags are compatible with crystallization and structure analysis and (b) they influence the threedimensional protein structure. To address these questions, we have constructed a polypeptide, His 6-SH3StrepII, consisting of the 60-aa Src homology-3 domain (SH3) of chicken -spectrin [13] fused N-terminally to a His 6 tag [14] and C-terminally to a StrepII tag [15, 16] (Figure 1). The possible detrimental effects of the affinity tags on structure analysis and native-like conformation of this SH3 domain would be expected to be pronounced, since the two tags represent more than one fourth of the total fusion protein mass. It is shown that His 6-SH3-StrepII is easily purified to homogeneity by double-affinity chromatography over Ni-chelate and streptavidin columns, can be crystallized under various conditions, and has biophysical properties and a crystal structure similar to the unlabeled SH3 domain [13].

Material and methods Plasmid construction A cDNA fragment encoding the SH3 domain was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pET-SH3, obtained from the late M. Saraste (EMBL, Heidelberg), with the primers SH3-chick-U (5 -GGGGATCCGATGAAACTGGAAAAGAGCTTGTGC-3 ) and SH3chick-L (5 -GGATGGATGCGGCCGCTAGTTTTTTCACATAGGCAGCTGG-3 ). The product was then cloned between the BamHI and NotI sites of pQStrep2, a modified form of the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen, Genbank accession no. AY028642). pQStrep2 provides for a N-terminal His 6 tag and a C-terminal StrepII tag [16]. The helper plasmid pSE111 was obtained from Dr. E. Scherzinger (Berlin) and carries the lacI Q repressor and the argU gene for a rare tRNA.

219 Protein fermentation and purification Two 500 ml LB cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) pQStrep2 (carrying the gene for SH3 and encoding ampicillin resistance) pSE111, supplemented with 50 µg/ml ampicillin and 25 µg/ml kanamycin, were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm. The culture was then induced with 1 mM IPTG. Two hours later the cells (OD 600 2.0) were collected and washed with physiological salt solution. The cell pellet (4.4 g wet mass) was resuspended in 25 ml buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole). The cells were desintegrated by two passages through a French pressure cell, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant cleared by ultrafiltration through a 0.45 µm device yielding 45 ml crude extract. Protein purification was performed on an automated FPLC (Vision workstation, PE Biosystems) at room temperature. 10 ml of the crude extract were applied to a 1.7 ml Ni 2+-charged MC-Poros column previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed and the bound protein eluted with imidazole in a gradient from 0 to 300 mM in buffer A and immediately applied to a 10 ml StrepTactinSepharose column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany), equilibrated with buffer B (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). The column was washed and the protein of interest eluted by injecting 20 ml of 1 mM desthiobiotin (Sigma) in buffer B. The peak fractions were pooled (total volume 15 ml) and the buffer exchanged through a desalting column (HiPrep 26/10, Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes/KOH pH 6.0, 20 mM NaCl. Finally, the sample was adjusted to a concentration of 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (cutoff 5 kDa, Millipore). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry For Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, the protein samples were freeze-dried and re-diluted in D 2O containing 150 mM NaCl, yielding a concentration of 10 mg/ml. A pH of 7.5 was adjusted in each sample by adding a few microliters of diluted NaOH or HCl, respectively. About 50 µl of the protein were injected into a temperature-controlled 30 mm diameter transmission cell with two BaF 2 windows and a 50 µm polytetrafluorethylene gasket. The cell was placed in the sample chamber of a Bruker ifs 66-V, equipped with a LN 2-cooled HgMnTe detector (J15D series, EG&G Judson) and continuously flushed with dry air. Prior to each sample measurement, reference buffer was filled into the freshly assembled chamber through injection ducts. A single beam spectrum was taken, then the buffer was removed and the protein sample was injected. The temperature was raised linearly ( T = 1 K/min), spectra were taken every 5 K. The second derivatives of the difference spectra were calculated using the instrument software (Opus 3.0, Bruker Optik GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany). Automated protein crystallization Initial crystallization conditions for His 6-SH3-StrepII were screened in hanging-drop vapor-diffusion mode in a 96-well microplate using a commercial screen (Hampton Research). The protein drops (1 µl droplet volume) were set on a 2D array on a compact glass substrate in less than 60 s using dispensing equipment developed in-house [17]. The screening solution of 1 µl was added rapidly by a multichannel pipetting robot Hydra (Robbins). In parallel, a standard 96-well microplate (655 101, Greiner) was filled with screening solutions of 150 µl each, using the same system. Taken together, the complete 96-condition screening plate was prepared in less than 3 min. The first crystals sized larger than 100 µm were detected after 4 days. After 22 days, additional crystals of various size and morphology appeared under six other screening conditions. For diffraction experiments, a crystal of 320 × 300 × 200 µm grown from 10% (by vol.) dioxane, 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 1.6 M ammonium sulfate was harvested after 26 days. X-ray diffraction, structure determination and refinement X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MARResearch imaging plate detector (300 mm diameter) mounted on a direct-drive Rigaku Denki RU H2R X-ray generator producing Cu-K radiation. The crystal was cooled to 110 K after exchanging the surrounding mother liquor with paraffin oil [18]. Diffraction data processing statistics are shown in Table 1. For structure solution by molecular replacement using AMORE [19], the SH3 domain of chicken -spectrin [13], pdb entry 1SHG, served as a search model. It gave a clear solution in the cross rotation function with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.82 for reflections from 8-4 Å. With an R value of 39.6% and a correlation coefficient of 0.62, the true space group, P4 32 12, could be easily distinguished from the other

polypeptides, the use of protease inhibitors was not required. After desalting and concentration, the protein sample was ready for biophysical characterization and crystallization. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry is widely used for protein structure analysis [22, 23]. The region between 1,600 and 1,700 cm -1 in the FTIR spectrum is called the amide I band. Absorption in this region is mainly due to C=O stretching vibrations, slightly coupled with CN stretching, CCN deformation and NH bending vibrations [23]. The band position of the amide I band is strongly influenced by the formation of hydrogen bonds, because these interactions alter the force constants of donor as well as acceptor groups and influence the frequencies for their stretching and bending vibrations. Thus, the amide I position allows to distinguish between secondary structure elements that build up the overall structure of the protein [24]. Figure 3(a) (upper black curve) shows the second derivative of the amide I region for the untagged chicken -spectrin SH3 domain. The most intense absorption at about 1,633 cm -1, together with a very pronounced second maximum at 1,681 cm -1, points to a high content (>80%) of -sheet [24]. The presence of a small amount of -helical conformations could be deduced from absorption bands between 1,646 and 1,660 cm -1 [25]. In addition, there is a small absorption at 1,666 cm -1, a wave number often reported for 3 10-helices [22]. The spectrum of His 6-SH3-StrepII is only slightly different from that of the untagged SH3 domain (see Figure 3(a), upper blue curve): The most intense absorption is shifted a little towards smaller wave numbers (1,628 cm -1). This indicates a more compact structure of the -barrel. At higher wave numbers the bands known from the untagged SH3 domain become less defined, presumably due to the presence of unordered regions within the affinity tags. Taken together, the tags seem to have only a slight influence on the secondary structure of the SH3 domain in solution. We observe only small changes in the secondary structure of His 6-SH3-StrepII up to 70 °C (see Figure 3(a), lower black curve). In contrast, there are temperature-dependent changes in the untagged SH3 domain that result in a spectrum (lower blue curve in Figure 3(a)) similar to His 6-SH3-StrepII. The struc-

A stepwise improvement of the model was achieved starting with a rigid-body relaxation and subsequent simulated annealing with torsional dynamics calculation. After this initial stage, several rounds of positional refinement, individual B-factor refinement and manual model building led to the final model with a R value of 20.0% and R free of 24.9%. Although the data quality was not excellent, 9 out of 11 C-terminal StrepII-tag residues could be easily placed in the difference electron density. The 12 N-terminal His 6tag residues and the following following residues 2-5 of the native polypeptide chain were not represented in the electron density, presumably due to flexibility of the N-terminus. Atomic coordinates and X-ray diffraction data were deposited with the Protein Data Bank [21], accession number 1NEG.

Results Sample preparation for structure analysis A 250-ml culture of the recombinant E. coli clone yielded 1.1 g of wet cell paste out of which 12 mg of His 6-SH3-StrepII were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity (Figure 2). The tandem configuration of the MC-Poros and StrepTactin affinity columns allowed the preparation of pure protein within two hours. Due to the speed of removal of contaminating

ture becomes less ordered, as can be seen from theabsorption at 1,648 cm -1. Shown in greater detail in Figure 3(b) is the shift of the most intense absorption to 1,629 cm -1 at 70 °C, reflecting the development of a structure as compact as that of His 6-SH3-StrepII. At temperatures above 70 °C the spectra of both protein variants display bands at around 1,615 cm -1 and 1,678 cm -1 characteristic for the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between extended chains following denaturation or aggregation [22]. Crystal structure analysis The structure of His 6-SH3-StrepII was determined at 2.3 Å resolution and refined against X-ray diffraction data from a laboratory source (Table 2). Residues Lys6 to Phe70 of the fusion protein (see Figure 1) are revealed by electron density. Thus, the N-terminal His 6 tag and five N-terminal residues of the SH3 domain are completely disordered in the crystal, whereas most residues of the C-terminal StrepII tag are structured and observed. Disorder of the N-terminal pentapeptide of the SH3 domain was observed earlier [13] and is thus not due to the presence of the His 6 tag. The partial order of the StrepII peptide is mainly due to intermolecular contacts between residues Leu61, His67 and Gln69 and residues Arg21, Lys43 and Gln50 of a neighboring molecule in the crystal lattice. With the exception of three residues, all backbone torsion angles are in the most preferred region of the Ramachandran diagram of PROCHECK [26]. Asn47, located in a turn between strands 2 and

This was observed earlier in the crystal structure of the chicken -spectrin SH3 domain [13] where Asn47 resides in the disallowed region of the / diagram. The electron density prompted us to model three residues (Lys26, Lys60 and Gln69) with two alternative side-chain conformations and to include 48 water molecules and one ion into the model. As expected, His 6-SH3-StrepII displays the typical fold of a SH3 domain which is characterized by the antiparallel pairing of five -strands interspersed by loops of varying length (Figure 4).

due 3 10-helix between -strands 4 and 5 of His 6-SH3StrepII is found in nearly all SH3 domains studied so far [27, 28]. An elongated difference density (see Figure 4) atop a crystallographic twofold axis between two protein molecules was interpreted as a half occupied azide anion. This interpretation is based on the form of the density which accommodates the linear azide very well and the vicinity of two positive charges from the symmetry-equivalent Lys59 residues. In a least-squares fit, the C atoms of His 6-SH3StrepII superimpose onto the matching atoms of the

chicken -spectrin SH3 domain (1SHG, ref. 13) with a rms deviation of 0.44 Å, and all equivalent atoms of the two structures superimpose with a rms deviation of 1.08 Å. The secondary structure elements are particularly well conserved between the molecules (see Figure 4). Thus, the two crystal structures are nearly identical within the error limits of the structure analyses at 2.3 Å and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively, and considering the packing in different crystal lattices. We note, in addition, that there is no systematic difference between the structures near the ends of the polypeptide chains where the tags present in His 6-

SH3-StrepII might be suspected to distort the molecular geometry. Finally, we wish to point out that the slightly worse resolution of the X-ray data obtained from the His 6-SH3-StrepII crystal may be due to the

X-ray source (rotating anode versus synchrotron beamline as used for the SH3 data collection [13]) and thus cannot or cannot fully be attributed to the presence of the purification tags.

224 Discussion Speeding up the production of crystallizable protein is a core issue in every structural genomics project or high-throughput structure analysis scheme [29­31]. Among the approaches towards this end adopted by the Protein Structure Factory [11, 12] is the dual affinity tagging of proteins with a His 6 [14] and a StrepII [15, 16] peptide epitope. This strategy was chosen for a number of reasons and has been tested with a set of human proteins recombinantly produced in either E. coli or yeast. So far, it has been observed that the cost-effective N-terminal His 6 tag usually affords an electrophoretic purity between 90 and 95% in the initial purification step. Since this is considered insufficient for crystallization and structure analysis, it is vital to add a second affinity chromatographic step for fast and efficient protein purification. As described above, we have chosen a C-terminal StrepII tag to serve this purpose. Using a C-terminal tag ensures that only full-length proteins are purified. The combination of the two affinity chromatographies allows for fast, reliable and easily automatable protein preparation. A time-consuming optimization of additional chromatographic steps according to the properties of individual proteins and cost- and laborintensive proteolytic treatments with the accompanying risk of degrading the protein are avoided. To further increase the throughput in protein purification, it may be necessary and possible to run the described protocol with many samples in parallel, perhaps in a 96-well format with the perspective to automate the whole procedure as recently described by several authors [32­34]. One concern when working with affinity-tagged proteins is that the peptide epitopes added to the natural polypeptide chain termini might interfere with crystallization due to their inherent flexibility. In the case of His 6-SH3-StrepII, this concern proved unfounded. Crystals were obtained from 8 out of 96 tested screen conditions [35], and the structure analysis was carried out with a crystal taken directly from the primary screen without further optimization. We thus demonstrate that protein crystallization and structure analysis are indeed possible with affinitytagged proteins, even in the extreme case where more than one fourth of the fusion protein mass originates from two peptide tags. We do not intend to suggest that this approach will always yield the desired result, i.e. well diffracting single crystals. It is well documented [36] that the removal of peptide tags may be beneficial for crystallization of certain proteins. On the other hand, there have been a few examples of proteins that crystallized better when fused to molecules used for affinity purification [10]. Our suggestion is that constructs such as the His 6-SH3StrepII presented here may be a good starting point for high-throughput structure analysis, since they permit easy and automatable protein purification and can, in principle, be crystallized. In recent work, we have been able to grow diffraction-quality crystals of several other affinity-tagged proteins. The additional concern that the affinity tags might alter the protein structure in an unnatural way also proved unfounded in the case of His 6-SH3-StrepII. The crystal structure showed its SH3 domain to be virtually indistinguishable from the unmodified SH3 domain [13]. The infrared spectra we measured for the proteins in solution serve as a control for this observation. They, too, reveal only slight differences between both protein forms that can well be explained by contributions of the tags to the overall secondary structure that are independent of the protein core. There are scattered reports in the literature of other proteins, the structures of which remained unchanged when purification tags were added to the wildtype form [37, 38]. Our main finding is that this remains true, even if the tags represent a considerable fraction of the total protein mass. Hence, the use of two short terminal peptide tags should be considered as an option for affinity purification of proteins for structural studies, since it permits highly efficient protein purification and may neither interfere with crystallization nor change the conformation of the protein of interest.
