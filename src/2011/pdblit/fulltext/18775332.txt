Abstract It is established that cytokine receptors signal after ligand binding as homo- or hetero-dimers in heteromeric complexes, but it is unclear, when dimerization occurs. To investigate gp130 dimerization, we performed co-precipitation experiments with the endogenous cytokine receptors gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R) and with gp130 variants carrying two different C-terminal peptide tags. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was employed to detect dimerization of two fluorescent-tagged gp130 variants. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used for FRET detection in live cells. gp130 and LIF-R could be coprecipitated in the absence of ligand. The interaction, however, was intensified by the addition of LIF. Similar results were obtained with the gp130 variants and confirmed by FRET analysis in live cells. The present study clearly demonstrates the existence of preformed but inactive gp130/LIF-R hetero- and gp130/gp130 homo-dimers. The addition of ligand enhanced the respective dimer formation and was required for signal transduction. ” 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The transmembrane protein gp130 is the shared receptor subunit and signal transducer of the interleukin (IL)-6 cytokine family. Other members of the family include leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11, IL-27, IL-31, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-like related cytokine, neurotrophin-1/B-cell stimulating factor 3 (NNT-1), neuropoietin (NPN), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). The IL-6 type cytokines are involved in proliferation and differentiation processes, preCorresponding author. Fax: +49 431 880 5007. E-mail address: rose-john@biochem.uni-kiel.de (S.

dominantly in the hematopoietic system, in neural cells, and in the immune response. The usage of gp130 together with specific a-receptors (IL-6R, IL-11R, CNTF-R, and CLF-1) and other b-receptors (LIF-R, OSMR, GPL, and Wsx-1) as signal transducers is responsible for the overlapping and in part distinct cellular functions described for IL-6 type cytokines (for detailed reviews, see [1,2]). The b-receptors gp130 and LIF-R belong to the class of tall cytokine receptors which exhibit three fibronectin domains between the ligand binding domains and the transmembrane domains of the receptors [3]. While IL-6 signals via a complex of IL-6, IL-6-a-receptor (IL-6R), and two gp130 molecules [4], the LIF signal is transduced by a trimeric complex of one molecule each of LIF, LIF-receptor (LIF-R), and gp130 [4]. The ligand induced activation of the complexes leads to the activation of associated Janus kinases (JAKs) that phosphorylate

S. Tenhumberg et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 346 (2006) 649≠657 C-terminal residues of gp130: GYMPQ-LEDQVDPRLIDGK) or a Haemofilus influenza peptide tag (gp130-HA: GYMPQ-RYPYDVPDYA) [15] resulting in mature fusion proteins of 931 amino acid residues (gp130PC) and with 928 amino acid residues (gp130-HA), both with a calculated unglycosylated mass of 105 kDa. For FRET analysis the gp130 cDNA was cloned into the multiple cloning site of the vectors for enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (pECFPN1) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (pEYFP-N1) from BD Biosciences (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A PCR fragment was used to truncate the gp130 molecule after amino acid 776 (135 amino acids downstream from the transmembrane domain) and fused the protein to the fluorescent tags with a 7 amino acid linker. The amino acid sequence of gp130-CFP, gp130-YFP, and the linker including the last 5 C-terminal residues of gp130 and the first 5 N-terminal residues of the fluorescent protein were PSVQV-GDPPVAT-MVSKG. Detailed sequence information is available from the authors. All constructs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector p409 [16]. The fusion proteins consisting of the truncated gp130 fused to CFP or YFP have a calculated unglycosylated mass of 115 kDa. A CFP-YFP fusion protein with a 37 amino acid linker (515 aa, 58 kDa, termed CY37) [17] was used as positive control for FRET analysis. Cell culture and transfection. COS-7 (African green monkey kidney fibroblast), HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), and HTB10 (human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 4.5 g/l glucose, sodium pyruvate, and L-glutamine, supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were transfected by the DEAE dextran method [18]. Cells for microscopy were grown on glass coverslips and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (CellPhect Transfection Kit, Amersham, UK). Ligand stimulation was performed by incubating the cells prior to further use with a single dose of 50 ng LIF or 10 ng Hyper-IL-6 (HIL6) per milliliter cell culture medium for 20 min at 37 ∞C. HIL6 is a soluble IL-6R/IL-6 chimera with the biological activity of the naturally occurring soluble IL-6R/IL-6 complex [19] that is responsible for the IL-6-transsignaling [20]. Cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM Na-orthovanadate, complete protease inhibitor mix without EDTA (Boehringer≠Mannheim, Germany), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 1 mM), and 1% Brij96, and lysed by freezing at ¿20 ∞C and thawing at 37 ∞C. For FRET spectroscopy a different lysis buffer composed of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mix with EDTA (Boehringer≠Mannheim, Germany) was used. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000g for 5 min and the supernatant was used for further analysis. Western blot and immuno-precipitation. The monoclonal mouse antibodies anti-PC-tag mAB HPC4 (gift from Hugues Gascan), anti-HA-tag mAB 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), and the anti-HA-tag rabbit polyclonal antibody sc805 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were used. The anti-HA-tag mAB 12CA5 was used for immuno-precipitation and the anti-HA-tag antibody sc805 for Western blot. Furthermore, the polyclonal anti-gp130 antibody sc-655 and the polyclonal anti-LIF-R antibody sc-659, which both recognize the C-terminal domains of the receptors, were used (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) as well as the monoclonal antibody anti-human CD 130 clone B-P4 (Diaclone research, Stamford, CT, USA), which recognizes domain 4 of gp130. Additionally, Phospho-Stat3 Antibody (New England Biolabs, Bad Schwalbach, Germany), Phospho-Tyrosine monoclonal antibody (P-Tyr-100) #9411 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), and b-actin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used for Western blotting. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) as described by the manufacturer and labeled proteins were precipitated with streptavidin immobilized on agarose beads (Sigma≠Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). Lysates were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immuno-precipitated with the appropriate antibodies and protein A≠Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Proteins were separated by SDS≠PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham

themselves and the b-receptors (gp130 and LIF-R). The phosphotyrosines on gp130 provide docking sites for the SH2-domains of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3). Bound STAT3 becomes phosphorylated, dimerizes, and translocates into the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes, e.g., acute phase response genes in hepatocytes [2]. The activation of the signal transduction complex was long believed to be triggered by the dimerization of the b-receptors [5]. However, preformed dimers have been described for other cytokine receptors like the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) [6,7], the tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNF-R1) [8], the IL-17R [9] or the IL-10R, and the IFN-c receptor [10]. In these dimeric complexes, the distance of the two intracellular C-terminal domains is determined by the presence or absence of the ligand, thereby reducing background signaling of unliganded receptor [6,11]. A preformed EpoR dimer would facilitate efficient activation with relatively few receptors (<1000) on the cell surface [6]. Recently, Giese et al. reported on homo-dimerization of gp130 and heterodimerization of gp130 and LIF-R. In this carefully performed study the authors used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques and detected ligand independent preformed dimerization of gp130 but not LIF-R [12]. The constructs used by Giese et al., however, were not signaling competent since they only contained 27 cytoplasmic amino acid residues of gp130 and 23 cytoplasmic amino acid residues of LIF-R, which clearly is not sufficient for activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway [13,14]. Therefore, these experiments do not necessarily reflect the situation of gp130 activation on target cells. We therefore set out to analyze the existence of preformed membrane bound homo-dimers of gp130 and hetero-dimers of gp130/LIF-R. In a first round of experiments we performed co-precipitations of gp130 and LIF-R in the absence and presence of ligand. We then constructed gp130 variants, which at the C-terminus of the full length protein contained two different peptide tags for coprecipitation experiments, which again were probed in the absence and presence of ligand. Finally, we constructed C-terminal fusions of gp130 with cyan fluorescent and yellow fluorescent protein in a way that the fusion proteins were signaling competent since they contained 135 cytoplasmic amino acids which are clearly sufficient for gp130 signaling [14]. FRET analysis was performed on the cell surface of intact living cells in the absence and presence of ligand. We clearly demonstrate ligand independent dimerization of gp130. Remarkably, the dimers seem to be stabilized in the presence of ligand presumably due to activation of the intracellular signaling machinery. Experimental procedures
Preparation of gp130 constructs. For precipitation experiments the human full length gp130 protein was tagged at the C-terminus either with a protein-C tag (gp130-PC, amino acid sequence including the last 5

Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody followed by a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (anti-mouse IgG HRP from sheep, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Membranes were developed using the Amersham ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). FRET spectrofluorimetry, microscopy, and laser scanning. Cell-free lysates were used for spectrofluorimetry and fluorescence emission was measured on a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ, USA). For CFP, the excitation wavelength was set at 425 nm and emission was scanned from 450 to 550 nm. For YFP, excitation was set at 485 nm and emission was scanned from 500 to 550 nm. The emission scan spectra were corrected for background using lysates from cells transfected with untagged gp130. FRET measurements using confocal microscopy were essentially performed as described by Zhu [17]. Transfected HEK 293 cells were mounted on glass slides without fixation and examined immediately with a Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope. Images were recorded at the Molecular Imaging Center, UC Berkeley, CA, USA. CFP images were collected using an excitation laser of 458 nm and a 462≠505 nm emission filter; YFP images were collected using an excitation laser of 514 nm and a 526≠537 nm emission filter. For FRET images an excitation laser of 458 nm was used and the emission filters were set to 526≠537 nm. Measurement of FRET signals, correction of bleed-through, and normalization of the FRET data were all performed as previously described [21]. The norms for the percentage of CFP or YFP bleedthrough under the microscope settings used were determined to be 0.27 (a, CFP) and 0.18 (b, YFP) using cells expressing pure CFP and pure YFP, respectively. No bleed-through signal from CFP was detected under the YFP filter setting and vice versa. Net FRET (nF) was calculated as nF = (IFRET) ¿ (ICFP ∑ a) ¿ (IYFP ∑ b), where IFRET, ICFP, and IYFP are the respective signal intensities in the analyzed area, and a and b are the corrections for CFP and YFP bleed-through, respectively, as previously described by Xia and Liu [21]. Normalized FRET (NFRET) was calculated as NFRET = nF (IYFP ∑ ICFP)¿1/2.

Results HepG2 and HTB10 cells express the cytokine receptors gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R) endogenously (Fig. 1A) [22]. Signal transduction was only initiated in the presence of LIF as demonstrated by phosphorylation of the receptors and consequently phosphorylation of STAT3; it is absolutely dependent on ligand binding (Fig. 1B and C). Cell lysates of HTB10 cells were immuno-precipitated with antibodies against gp130 and LIF-R, and consequently blotted either with anti-LIF-R or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1C). No phosphorylation of the receptor molecules was observed in the absence of ligand. Addition of LIF to the cells prior to lysis led to the co-precipitation of the phosphorylated receptors gp130 and LIF-R (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, detection with anti-LIF-R antibody showed receptor hetero-dimerization in the absence of the ligand LIF, which increased upon ligand addition (Fig. 1C). The cell lysates of HepG2 cells were subjected to the same immuno-precipitation scheme. Western blots were performed with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-gp130, and anti-LIF-R antibodies. As seen in HTB10 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on LIF addition (Fig. 1D). Anti-gp130 precipitates, blotted with anti-LIF-R antibody, showed hetero-dimerization in the presence and absence of LIF as detected in the vice versa experiment (Fig. 1D). Remarkably, the addition of the

ligand LIF leads in both cell lines investigated to a stronger interaction of gp130 and LIF-R (Fig. 1C and D). Homo-dimerization of gp130 has not been analyzed in detail biochemically so far. Murakami et al. showed that binding of IL-6 to IL-6R induced disulfide-linked homodimerization of gp130 but no dimerization in the absence of ligand was detected [5]. We constructed two variants of gp130 with two different C-terminally positioned peptide tags which were recognized by two monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2A). COS-7 cells, which express only low levels of gp130, were cotransfected with the two gp130 constructs. The specific recognition of the tags by the antibodies used was validated in lysates of cells transfected with gp130-PC and gp130-HA alone or in combination. Cotransfected

Fig. 2. Two differentially tagged gp130 variants expressed in COS-7 cells co-precipitate in the absence and presence of HIL6. COS-7 cells were transfected with a PC-tagged gp130 variant or a HA-tagged variant alone or with both variants together. Cotransfected cells were incubated in the presence and absence of Hyper-IL-6. (A) The scheme shows the gp130 fusion proteins used (B) cell lysates were subjected to SDS≠PAGE and Western blotting using anti-PC (a-PC), anti-HA (a-HA), anti antiphospho-STAT3, and anti-a-b-actin antibodies. (C) COS-7 cells were transfected with HA- and PC-tagged gp130 cDNAs alone and in combination, and cell lysates were immuno-precipitated with anti-PC (aPC) antibodies. The precipitates were separated by SDS≠PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using anti-HA (a-HA), anti-phosphotyrosine (a-PY), and anti-LIF-R antibodies.

The data clearly show that gp130 and LIF-R on the cell membrane are in close proximity and can therefore be co-precipitated. This close proximity is, however, not sufficient to lead to activation of JAK kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT3. Interestingly, we detected a significant increase of co-precipitation of gp130 and LIF-R in the presence of LIF. The efficiency of co-precipitation of two gp130 molecules was affected by the addition of the ligand Hyper-IL-6 to a lesser extent. Our FRET data, however, demonstrate a clear increase of receptor dimerization upon Hyper-IL-6 addition (see below). In order to accumulate further evidence for preformed membrane bound cytokine receptors by an independent method in intact living cells, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was employed. This method detects whether two fluorescent proteins are in close proximity ∞ (<100 A). Gp130 was tagged with two variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), cyan (CFP) and yellow (YFP) fluorescent protein. The C-terminal region of the gp130 cDNA was truncated at the position coding for amino acid 776, which left intact the binding sites for the Janus kinases called box1 and box2 [2]. Gp130 proteins with 133 amino acids downstream of the transmembrane region have clearly been shown to be signaling competent [14]. These truncated gp130 cDNAs were fused with cDNAs coding for CFP and YFP, generating constructs for the fusion proteins gp130-CFP and gp130-YFP, respectively (Fig. 3A). The truncations were introduced to assess the proximity of those protein regions in which the docking sites of the Janus kinases are located.

cells were either left untreated or incubated with Hyper-IL6 prior to lysis. The anti-HA antibody only recognized the HA tag but not the PC tag and vice versa (Fig. 2B). HyperIL-6 was essential for signal transduction via the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2B). Cell lysates of the differently transfected cells were immuno-precipitated with an antiPC antibody and blotted with an antibody against HA and phosphotyrosine. Detection with an antibody against gp130 showed successful precipitation of the tagged gp130 proteins. The anti-HA antibody did not detect precipitated gp130PC alone (Fig. 2C). In the cotransfected cells gp130 dimers with PC and HA tag were coprecipitated (Fig. 2C). Clearly, dimerization was not dependent on the addition of the ligand Hyper-IL-6. However, as in the case of the gp130/LIF-R hetero-dimer, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of gp130 was strictly dependent on the presence of the ligand (Fig. 2C).

Unprecipitated cell lysate from gp130-PC transfected cells was used as positive control.

Cells were surface biotinylated and cell lysates were precipitated with streptavidine agarose beads, separated by SDS≠PAGE, and detected with a gp130 specific antibody. As depicted in Fig. 3B, the fusion proteins gp130-CFP and gp130-YFP were expressed on the cell surface in transfected HepG2, COS-7, and HEK293 cells to a comparable extent as PC-tagged gp130. The differently truncated and tagged gp130 proteins appear to have similar masses of about 130 kDa upon SDS≠PAGE (Fig. 3B) which is consistent with the theoretical unglycosylated protein masses of 105 kDa (gp130-CFP, gp130-YFP) and 115 kDa (gp130PC). The small remaining differences were not resolved by gel electrophoresis. Cell surface expression of gp130CFP and gp130-YFP was also confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (see Fig. 5D and E). The fluorescent properties of the expressed (fusion) proteins were analyzed in cell lysates of transfected HepG2 (Fig. 4) and HEK293 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, after appropriate excitation, CFP cotransfected

Fig. 4. The affinity of the gp130 homo-dimer increases upon ligand addition as shown by spectrofluorimetry. (A) Cell lysates of HepG2 cells transfected with CFP and YFP together (grey line) and with CY37, a fusion protein, in which YFP-CFP are linked by a 37 amino acid linker (black line) were used as negative and positive control, respectively. The emission spectra after excitation at 425 nm show the typical CFP peak at 475 nm and in the positive control a strong FRET signal at 527 nm. Emission values of the controls were scaled down for better comparison. (B) Cell lysates of HepG2 cells cotransfected with gp130-CFP and gp130YFP with (black line) and without (grey line) treatment with Hyper-IL-6 were analyzed. The reduction of the CFP signal at 475 nm together with an intensity increase at 527 nm (arrows) shows FRET interaction upon ligand addition.

with YFP resulted in peaks at 480 and 502 nm, whereas a fusion protein of CFP and YFP with a 37 amino acid linker (CY37) gave a strong FRET signal at 525 nm (Fig. 4A). The fusion protein gp130-CFP showed an excitation maximum at 434 nm and emission maxima at 475 and 502 nm (data not shown), whereas gp130-YFP had excitation maxima at 485 and 520 nm, and a characteristic emission maximum at 527 nm (data not shown). In the cell lysates the overall sensitivity to measure FRET with the gp130 fusion proteins was low since the small number of receptors is highly diluted in the cell lysates, reducing the probability to form functional dimers. Nevertheless, gp130 dimers were detected in the presence of Hyper-IL-6 as represented by the shoulder in the spectrum at 525 nm (Fig. 4B, black line). In the absence of ligand no shoulder was observed (Fig. 4B, grey line). Thus, in the absence of ligand binding the distance between the fluorescent tags downstream of position 776 appears to be too large to result in a FRET-signal above background. The interaction between gp130 molecules is enhanced by the addition of ligand and the signal strength with it, rendering it clearly distinguishable above background. The enhanced interaction can either be interpreted as an increase in the number of interacting molecules or as a closer position of the fluorescent tags, thereby increasing the intensity of the individual signals. Microscopic FRET measurements in living cells showed an even distribution of the soluble fluorescent proteins CFP and YFP in the cytoplasma (Fig. 5A≠C). The gp130 fusion proteins, on the contrary, were located at the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus and/or the endoplasmatic reticulum (Fig. 5D≠I). A FRET signal and, indicated by this, gp130 dimers were detected in the absence (Fig. 5F) and presence of Hyper-IL-6 (Table 1). The digital images were corrected for background signals and normalized FRET (NFRET) was calculated. The values indicate FRET between the two different fluorescent proteins in the absence of ligand (Table 1), which was not detectable in the cell lysates. In the presence of ligand FRET increased. The high standard deviation observed is likely due to laser fluctuations with the low laser intensities used. Living cells are sensitive to higher intensity lasers and photobleaching occurs. Furthermore, low FRET intensities that result from the dilution of gp130-YFP/gp130-CFP hetero-dimers with gp130-CFP/gp130-CFP and gp130YFP/gp130-YFP homo-dimers increase the variability of the FRET signal. Nevertheless, the addition of ligand leads to an increase in NFRET (Table 1), showing that both fluorophores are in greater proximity now. In order to clarify the results, we performed acceptor bleaching experiments (Fig. 5G≠I). When the acceptor of a FRET fluorophore pair is destroyed by bleaching with a high-energy laser (here 514 nm, 10 iterations at 100% laser output), the otherwise transferred energy can be emitted as additional light and leads to an increase in the donor signal. Bleaching of the acceptor YFP led to a significant increase (108.5% ± 5.0%, P = 0.0003, Table 1) of the CFP signal

654

Upon ligand addition a second significant increase (115.8 ± 7.0%, P = 0.0003, Table 1) marked the enhanced interaction of the two gp130 molecules. Again, this can be interpreted either as an increase in the number of dimers or in a closer proximity of the donor and acceptor fluorophores. The latter would fit the model of ligand induced activation of a preformed receptor dimer by conformational change as previously described for the EpoR [6,7]. Our data clearly demonstrate the occurrence of preformed gp130 cytokine receptor homo- and hetero-dimers in the plasma membrane and a stabilization of g130 homo- and hetero-dimers in response to the addition of the respective ligands (Hyper-IL-6 or LIF). Discussion
Fig. 5. FRET measurement and acceptor bleaching show the formation of gp130 homo-dimers in the absence of ligand. HEK 293 were transfected or cotransfected with CY37 (a fusion protein, in which YFP-CFP are linked by a 37 amino acid linker, FRET positive control), CFP and YFP (FRET negative control), gp130-CFP and gp130-YFP. Cells were mounted on glass slides without fixation and immediately examined under a Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope. CFP images were collected using a 462≠505 nm emission filter and an excitation laser of 458 nm; YFP images were collected using a 526≠537 nm emission filter and an excitation laser of 514 nm. For FRET images the emission filters were set to 526≠537 nm and an excitation laser of 458 nm was used.

Since the first prerequisite of receptor mediated signal transduction is the binding of receptor and ligand, the main focus in cytokine research was for a long time the investigation of the involved partners and their binding epitopes. In the next step, the stoichiometry of many signaling complexes has been determined and finally the attention was drawn to the assembly of cytokine receptor complexes. In this context, the formation of preformed dimers has been demonstrated for the well-described so-called ``short'' cytokine receptors erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR) [6,7] and human growth hormone (hGH) receptor (hGHR) [23]. Furthermore, other cytokine receptors like interferon gamma (INF-c), IL-10R [10,24], interleukin 17 receptor (IL-17R) [9], epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [25], and interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) [15,26] are described to exist as preformed dimers. Recently, Giese et al. [12] investigated the role of the first three domains D1 and D2/D3 of gp130 in binding of the IL-6/IL-6R complex and gp130 dimerization. The authors concluded that both epitopes contribute significantly to the signaling complex and that a preformed dimer of gp130 molecules was necessary for efficient ligand binding. Preformed dimers would therefore increase the sensitivity of cells to IL-6 stimulation. This group further detected the formation of gp130 homo- and gp130/LIF-R hetero-dimers in the presence and absence of ligand by FRET [12]. Additionally, Giese et al. used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to investigate whether the dimers are stable or are only transiently formed. They found that the IL-6/IL-6R complex renders the gp130 homo-dimer stable for several seconds. The authors finally concluded that the formation of gp130 homo-dimers was the predominant process while in the case of hetero-dimerization, the ligand recruits first its specific a-receptor and in the last step the common b-receptor gp130. This was, however, not in agreement with the results of Buk et al. [27] who investigated the polarity of cytokine receptor expression and signaling. Their experiments indicated that the tall cytokine receptors gp130, LIF-R, and the CNTF-a-R may exist as preformed homo- and hetero-dimers in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane.

The findings of Giese et al. [12] obtained with FRET and BiFC are not sufficient to conclude that gp130 LIF-R hetero-dimers are only generated in the presence of LIF since the spatial restrictions of FRET might have made the interaction under their experimental conditions unproductive. In fact, our co-precipitation results clearly demonstrate gp130/LIF-R dimerization in the absence of LIF. It is possible that the intracellular domains of the two receptors are, despite dimerization, not positioned in a way to give a strong FRET or BiFC signal. These discrepancies are likely to be due to the fact that Giese et al. used signaling incompetent gp130-CFP and gp130-YFP constructs, which contained a much shorter cytoplasmic portion of gp130 (27 amino acids of the membrane proximal C-terminus [12,28]) than the ones used in our FRET studies. In addition to the first half of the conserved Janus kinase (JAK) binding motif box 1/2, the 135 C-terminal amino acids of our constructs contain the second half as well as the docking site YSTV for the SH2 homology containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and YRHQ, the first of four STAT binding sites. Following Fukada et al. [14] who showed that 133 C-terminal amino acids of gp130 are sufficient to generate a gp130 mediated growth signal, the fusion proteins used in this study are associated with JAK kinases via box 1/2. JAKs are relatively large proteins of about 130 kDa that are constitutively associated with the unliganded cytokine receptors. This association with the nonactivated gp130 homo-dimer might increase its stability in the absence of ligand as compared to the results obtained by Giese et al. [12]. Upon ligand stimulation the JAKs trans-activate themselves by phosphorylation. The activated JAKs phosphorylate C-terminally located tyrosine residues (in our constructs Y759 and Y767) and with this provide docking sites for the subsequent binding of SHP2 and STAT3 proteins [1]. This recruitment of downstream effector molecules might further stabilize the signaling complex and lead to the intensified signal observed in our co-precipitation and FRET experiments. The increased FRET signal can signify a closer and more optimized positioning of the cytoplasmic regions for FRET. Our results therefore indicate that the activation of the intracellular signaling machinery contributes to the stabilization of the activated gp130 receptor complexes. By the addition of ligand, the truncated C-terminal domains are positioned in closer proximity to each other, which allows efficient FRET. Our immuno-precipitation experiments show that the IL-6 signaling receptors exist as preformed dimers, but are only activated upon ligand addition. Due to the truncation of our CFP- and YFP fusion proteins at the intracellular position 776, closely behind the JAK-binding region, our FRET data clearly demonstrate that in an inactive dimer these domains are not close enough to each other for JAK activation and phosphorylation to occur. Since gp130 containing receptor complexes form dimers in the absence of ligand it is interesting to ask how ligand induced receptor activation is brought about. How does

ligand binding result in the activation of the intracellular signaling machinery? There is clear experimental evidence for the trimeric composition of the short cytokine receptor signaling complexes like Epo/EpoR [29], GH/GHR [30], and INF-c/INFR [23]. Similar to those short cytokine receptors, the LIF signaling complex contains one molecule each of LIF, LIF-R, and gp130 [3]. On the contrary, the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 receptor complex has been described as a tetramer and a hexamer [31≠34], in each case composed of two gp130 molecules and one or two IL-6/IL-6R complexes. For the tall cytokine receptor signaling complexes the interaction of the cytokine binding domains of the membrane distal region of the proteins has been investigated and described in detail. More recently, the role of the membrane proximal domains D4≠D6 of gp130 in hetero-dimerization with LIF-R [35] and homo-dimerization with gp130 [36] has been investigated. Kurth et al. [36] described a separation of tasks in which the three membrane distal domains (D1≠D3) are responsible for ligand recognition while the membrane proximal domains (D4≠D6) are essential for signal transduction [37]. A certain flexibility in the hinge regions connecting D5 to D4 and D6 is proposed to aid the activation of the gp130 homo-dimer by IL-6/IL-6R by allowing the interaction of membrane bound IL-6R and gp130 [38]. Furthermore, the degree of rotation between the C-terminal domains of the two gp130 molecules drastically influences the phosphorylation of STAT3, a prerequisite of transcriptional activation [39]. Greiser et al. constructed active and inactive variants of a gp130 hybrid receptor by replacing the extracellular domains by the corresponding IL-5R domains. Subsequent introduction of 1≠4 amino acids into the juxtamembrane intracellular region led to differentially active gp130-hybrids, suggesting that gp130-mediated activation of STATs by Janus kinases is sensitive to rotational changes around the receptor axis perpendicular to the membrane [39]. Rotational models of activation have also been proposed for several other receptors like hGHR [40] epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, [25]), and EpoR [41]. For EpoR, a combination of subunit rotation and scissor like conformational changes has been discussed [29]. The transmembrane region has been shown to be essential for dimer formation in the absence of ligand [42]. The cytoplasmatic domains of the EpoR are kept apart in the unliganded complex and move into close proximity in the activated complex [6,7]. This model is in good agreement with our observation that the signal observed during FRET measurements increased in response to the addition of ligand as expected when the distance between the fluorophores located at the C-terminus of the tagged gp130 molecules is decreased. However, this method was not suited to determine the change of distance between the cytoplasmatic domains since the addition of ligand simultaneously stabilizes the gp130 homo-dimer as well as the gp130/LIF-R hetero-dimer as demonstrated by our co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

The present study used different experimental approaches to demonstrate the existence of preformed gp130/LIF-R hetero- and gp130/gp130 homo-dimers. The addition of the cognate ligands enhanced the dimerization and was required for signal transduction. The availability of preformed but inactive receptor dimers on the cell surface would aid in the fast receptor complex assembly and transduction of signals as it is observed in cytokine stimulation of cells. Furthermore, the requirement of conformational change for activation of downstream pathways would abolish background signaling by randomly formed unliganded dimers.
