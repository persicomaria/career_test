Abstract-l.

Computer graphics have been used to model replacements of conserved residues in immunoglobulin domains. 2. Replacements, even those involving large changes in side chain volume, could be accommodated in the domain but rotation and repacking of surrounding side chains was generally necessary. 3. Repacking often resulted in increases in inter-atomic distances between side chains and loss of some van der Waals' contacts. This would be expected to make the domain slightly less stable. 4. Losses in domain stability might not have a serious affect on antigen binding but could result in circulating antibody becoming more susceptible to biological degradation with considerable reduction in biological half-life.

INTRODUCTION A protein family generally conserves a number of amino acid residues that are essential for the structure

and function of its members (Dayhoff, 1978; Richardson, 1981). In the case of immunoglobuhns, conserved cysteine, tryptophan and numerous hydrophobic residues (Beale and Feinstein, 1976; Kabat et al., 1987) appear to stabilize the three dimensional structures of the constituent domains (Amzel and Poljak, 1979; Lesk and Chothia, 1982; Davies and Metzger, 1983). Each domain consists of two superposed anti-parallel beta-pleated sheets linked by a disulphide bridge formed by the conserved cysteine residues. The side chain of the conserved tryptophan residue and several other conserved hydrophobic side chains help to pack the domain interior. Immunoglobulin domains, particularly the V-domains, also conserve certain polar residues (Kabat et al., 1987; Beale, 1985) which in some cases can adopt different structural roles from one domain to another (Beale and Coadwell, 1989). In the present paper we describe some observations made to ascertain how substitutions of conserved residues can be accommodated by the domain. In the case of the VH domain of an antibody molecule produced from an A/J mouse hybridoma cell line, site directed mutagenesis has caused the conserved tryptophan residue to be replaced by an alanine residue with little affect on antigen binding (Sharon, 1988). In the VH domain of another antibody molecule (ABPC48) a point mutation has resulted in one of the conserved cysteine residues being replaced by one of tyrosine (Rudikoff and Pumphrey, 1986). Also, X-ray crystallographic results indicate that in the VH domain of the myeloma IgG NEWM a serine residue occupies a position normally filled by one of a hydrophobic nature. The amino acid sequences of numerous other proteins such as histocompatibility antigens, T-cell

antigen receptor and secretory component display homology with those of immunoglobuhns (Beale, 1985; Williams, 1987) although there are numerous divergent features. In the case of beta-2-microglobulin, the light chain of class I histocompatibility antigens, evolutionary divergence has resulted in a leucine or methionine occupying an homologous position to that of the conserved tryptophan residue found in immunoglobulin domains (Kabat et al., 1987). However, X-ray crystallography has revealed no major differences in the alpha-carbon backbone between beta-2-microglobulin and the C-domains of immunoglobulins (Becker and Reeke, 1985; Bjorkman et al., 1987) as regards their beta-pleated sheets. We have used computer graphics to study and model the replacements described above.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Atomic coordinates for immunoglobulin fragments Fab NEWM (Saul ef al., 1978), Fab KOL (Marquart et a/.,1980), Fab MCPC603 (Segal er al., 1974) Fab 5539 (Suh el al., 1986), Fab HYHELS (Sheriff et al., 1987) and FC KOL (Deisenhofer, 1981). and for HLA antigen A2 (Bjorkman ef al., 1987) and bovine beta-2-microglobulin (Becker and Reeke, 1985) were obtained from the Brookhaven Data Base (Bernstein er al., 1977). Only coordinates for C-alpha atoms were available for the last two proteins. Structures were visualized and manipulated by means of an Evans and Sutherland PS390 graphics work station linked to a VAX 1l/750 computer using the FRODO programme devised by Dr A. J. Jones and modified by Drs P. Evans and R. Hubbard. The single letter code for amino acid residues is employed throughout the text. Residue numbers are those given with the atomic coordinates and may differ from those given in Kabat et al. (1987). Packing of side chains was studied by displaying spheres of 100% van der Waals' radii around the atomic centres. van der Waals' contact refers to the touching or slight overlapping of spheres from different side chains. Overlaps in excess of 0.5 A were regarded as unfavourable.

RESULTS

AND DISCUSSION

The environment of the conserved tryptophan residue in immunoglobulin C-domains

Examination of the three-dimensional structures of CL, CHI, CH2 and CH3 domains in the Fab and Fc

molecules showed that the side chain of the conserved tryptophan residue was enclosed by a group of homologous side chains (Table 1). In the case of the CHI domain these consisted of 143C, 155V, 166V, 182S, 184V and 198C (Fig. la, b). All but 184V were in van der Waals' contact with 157W.

Spheres of van der Waals' radii were constructed around alpha-C and side chain C, N, 0 and S atoms then projected onto the plane of the paper.

Table I shows that the conserved tryptophan residue found in immunoglobulin domains has been replaced by one of leucine in beta-2-microglobulin, the light chain of class I histocompatibility antigens. This involves a reduction in side chain volume of 70 A' (Chothia, 1984). Examination of the alphacarbon backbone of the crystallographic structures for the human and bovine proteins revealed no marked displacement of beta-strands relative to those observed in immunoglobulin C-domains as already reported by Bjorkman et al. (1987) and Becker and Reeke (1985). The CHl domain has good homology with that of human beta-2-microglobulin (Table 1) so it was used to model the side chain replacements. Computer graphic substitution of 1S7W by L in the CHI domain created a spatial hole as can be appreciated from Fig. la, b. The substitution of 182s by Y, as in human beta-2-microglobulin, involved an increase in side chain volume of 105 A' (Chothia, 1984) which was used to fill the spatial hole. To achieve the best packing it was necessary to rotate the side chain of a threonine residue that had replaced 184V (Table 1, Fig. lc, d). In the case of bovine beta-2-microglobulin the position homologous with 182s of the CHl domain is still occupied by a serine residue (Table 1). However, 155V has been replaced by I which involves an increase in side chain volume of 27 A'. This helped to fill the spatial hole created by the replacement of 157W by L. Rotation of the side chain of 182s also helped to fill the space (Fig. le, f). The replacement and rotation of side chains discussed above produced small disturbances in the spatial positions of other neighbouring side chains resulting in a fairly widespread repacking although this was not studied in detail. Presumably side chains will pack to give the lowest energy state for a particular domain which might be higher or lower than that of a homologous domain. Energy calculations were not undertaken in the present work. However, numerous interatomic distances between side chains were observed to increase, with some loss of van der Waals' contact, to produce a somewhat looser structure. This implies a slightly higher energy state and some loss of domain stability. Differences in biological function and environment might make

several sections of peptide chain backbone. Except for 96C these side chains were in van der Waals' contact with 36W. Inspection of amino acid sequences given by Kabat et al. (1987) showed that the hydrophobic nature of these side chains was almost entirely conserved. In the other crystallographic VH domains the side chain of 36W was enclosed by side chains homologous with those in VH KOL (Table 2). There were however some differences in packing. For example the side chain of 20L made van der Waals' contact with that of 36W in VH KOL and VH NEWM but not in VH MCPC603 and VH 5536. In VH KOL there was van der Waals' contact between the side chains of 48V and 36W and there was an homologous contact in VH MCPC603. However, in VH NEWM and VH HYHELS the homologous side chains were not in van der Waals' contact. In VH HYELS five of the homologous side chains differ in nature from those in VH KOL (Table 2, Fig. 2c, e). The replacement of 79L by A involves a reduction in side chain volume of 76 AL3 which was found to cause complete loss of van der Waals' contact with the side chain of 36W. The replacement of 701 by F involves an increase in side chain volume of 35A and this was found to produce some increase in the area of van der Waals' contact with the side chain of 36W. In VH KOL the side chain of 48V was in van der Waals' contact with that of 36W yet in VH HYHELS the homologous side chain of 481, 27A' larger in volume, was not. Fig. 2a, b and Fig. 2c, e give some indication of the packing in VH KOL and VH HYHELS although some of the points mentioned above regarding the three-dimensional structures are considerably obscured in a two-dimensional diagram. Examination of other domains such as VH NEWM which have homologous side chains of differing volume from those in VH KOL led to the general conclusion that replacement of a side chain is accommodated in the domain mainly by the general repacking of surrounding side chains rather than a simple complimentary change in a spatially adjacent side chain.

Examination of the three dimensional structure of VH KOL showed that the side chain of 36W was enclosed by the side chains of 2OL, 22C, 48V, 701, 79L, 81L and 96C (Fig. 2a, b, Table 2) as well as

Although there is no crystallography for VH A/J it is homologous with VH HYHELS which can be used as a basis for modelling the substitutions. The replacement of 36W by A In VH A/J involves a reduction in side chain of 139 A' and would leave a large hole as can be appreciated from Fig. 2c, e. This was largely filled as follows.

in VH HYHELS for M as in VH A/J provided a longer side chain which could be extended in the domain interior as well as making van der Waals' contact with 36A (Fig. 2d, f). The replacement of 70F by L was compensated by slight rotation of the side chain. The side chain of 81M could be extended further into the domain whilst still maintaining van der Waals, contact with 36A. The side chains of 201, 22C and 96C could be reorientated so that they occupied more of the free space. Hence the replacement of 36W by A could be successfully accommodated in the VH domain. This is illustrated diagrammatically in Fig. 2d, f although of course several details of the three-dimensional structure are obscured in a simple two-dimensional representation. However, side chain packing in the derived structure was found to be somewhat loose as evidenced by increases in interatomic distances between side chains and some loss of van der Waals' contact. The extension and reorientation of side chains discussed above had to be compensated by slight alterations in the positions of other nearby side chains. Changes in conformation and packing of side chains is the most probable way in which substitutions are accommodated in the domain. The packing would produce the lowest energy state which in the case of the modelled VH A/J domain is likely to be higher than that in VH HYHELS and cause some loss in overall stability. This might have little affect on antibody binding but could cause an increase in susceptibility to biological degradation. The biological half-life could be considerably shortened making the protein unsuitable for circulating antibody. The replacement of a conserved cysteine residue by tyrosine in VH ABPC48 This replacement involves an increase in side chain volume of about 100 A' as well as removing the disulphide bridge which links the two beta-pleated sheets of the immunoglobulin domain. The crystallographic domain VH MCPC603 has good homology in amino acid sequence with that of VH ABPC48 so it was used to model the substitutions. The disulphide bridge formed by 22C and 98C is surrounded by the side chains of 4L, 6E, 36W and 8lL (Fig. 3a, b) as well as sections of peptide chain backbone. The side chains of 22C, 98C, 36W and 81 L are tightly packed and even after displacement did not provide adequate space for a tyrosine side chain substituted for that of 98C. As reported by Rudikoff and Pumphrey (1986) it was necessary to extend the tyrosine side chain in the opposite direction past that of 4L which required rotation as did the side chain of 81 L (Fig. 3c, d). Rotation of the side chain of the more distant 34M was also required to create sufficient space for the tyrosine aromatic ring. Thereby the substitution of 98C by Y could be accommodated in the VH domain but the packing was very tight. Since the usual disulphide bridge of immunoglobulin domains is missing in VH ABPC48 some drift in the relative positions of the two beta-pleated sheets could possibly occur to ease the tight packing of the tyrosine residue. Although this might not necessarily affect antigen binding it could again make the circulating

The presence of a serine residue in VH NEWM at a position occupied by hydrophobic residues in other VH domains Examination of VH sequences in Kabat et al. (1987) revealed that only 5 out of 486 lacked a hydrophobic residue at position 34 (two places before that of the conserved tryptophan residue). Therefore the presence of a serine residue at this position in the crystallographic structure of VH NEWM is a rare event. It should be noted that the tentative amino acid sequence given in Kabat et aI. (1987) records a tyrosine residue. In the other crystallographic structures; VH KOL, VH MCPC603 and VH 55536 have a methionine at this position and VH HYHELS has isoleucine. In VH KOL the side chain of 34M was found to be in van der Waals' contact with those of 29F and 79L (Fig. 4a). In VH HYHELS the homologous 341 was also in van der Waals' contact with 29F but 79L was replaced by A. This involved a reduction in side chain volume of 76A' and caused a loss of van der Waals contact with the side chain of 341 (Fig. 4b). The spatial hole left by this replacement was largely filled by the side chain of 341 due to its branched nature. In the case of VH NEWM the side chain of the unusual 34s was too short to make van der Waals contact with that of 29F (Fig. 4c). However, position 78 (equivalent to position 79 in VH KOL and VH HYHELS) was occupied by phenylalanine the side chain of which was large enough to make van der Waals' contacts with 34s and 29F. Hence the loss of

side chain volume and hydrophobicity by the replacement of 34M in VH KOL by S in VH NEWM was largely compensated by the replacement of 79L by F.
CONCLUSION

The conserved residues typical of immunoglobulin domains can undergo limited replacement in several ways. Evolutionary divergence has produced beta-2microglobulin in which the conserved tryptophan residue of immunoglobulins has been replaced by a leucine or methionine residue. A point mutation has resulted in the VH domain of an antibody molecule having a tyrosine residue in place of the usual cysteine residue of immunoglobulin domains. Site directed mutagenesis as enabled the conserved tryptophan residue of the VH domain of an antibody molecule to be replaced by an alanine residue with little affect on antigen binding affinity. Hence if the replacement of conserved residues can result in functionable molecules why are these events so rare? The replacements discussed in this paper all concern buried residues which play a stabilizing structural role rather than acting as markers or sites on the molecular surface. As described in this paper the replacements can be accommodated within the immunoglobulin domain with little difficulty but the necessary adjustments in side chain packing result in a less stable structure. This could shorten the biological half-life of the molecule making it unsuitable for circulating
antibody.
