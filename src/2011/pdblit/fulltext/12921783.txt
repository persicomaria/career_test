Abstract The phosphatidylcholine (PC)-preferring phospholipase C (PLC) from Bacillus cereus (PLCBc ) hydrolyzes various 1,2diacyl derivatives of PC at different rates. Substrates with side chains having eight or more carbons are present in micellular form in aqueous media and are processed most rapidly. The catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km ) for the hydrolyses of short-chain PCs at concentrations below their respective critical micelle concentrations also decreases as the side chains become shorter, and this loss of efficiency owes its origin to increases in Km . In order to ascertain whether the observed increases in Km might arise from conformational changes in the glycerol backbone, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed in D2 O to determine the 3 JHH and 3 JCH coupling constants along the glycerol subunit of 1,2-dipropanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (Km = 61 mM), 1,2-dibutanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Km = 21.2 mM) and 1,2-dihexanoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Km = 2.4 mM). Using these coupling constants, the fractional populations for each rotamer about the backbone of each of substrate were calculated. Two rotamers, which were approximately equally populated, about the sn-1^sn-2 bond of each substrate were significantly preferred, and in these conformers, the oxygens on the sn-1 and sn-2 carbons of the backbone were synclinal to optimize intramolecular hydrophobic interactions between the acyl side chains. There was greater flexibility about the sn-2^sn-3 bond, and each of the three possible staggered conformations was significantly populated, although there was a slight preference for the rotamer in which the oxygen bearing the phosphate head group was synclinal to the oxygen at the sn-2 carbon and to the sn-1 carbon ; in this orientation, the head group is folded back relative to the side chains. These studies demonstrate that there is no significant change in the conformation about the glycerol backbone as a function of side chain length in short-chain phospholipids. Thus, prior organization of the substrate seems an unlikely determinant of the catalytic efficiency of PLCBc , and other factors such as hydrophobic interactions or differential solvation/desolvation effects associated with the complexation of the substrate with PLCBc may be involved. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Phospholipids are the fundamental components of biological membranes, and hence knowledge of the structure, function and mechanism of the various enzymes that are involved in phospholipid synthesis and hydrolysis is important. Of the enzymes that process phospholipids, members of the phospholipase C (PLC) class, which catalyze the hydrolysis of the phospholipid into diacylglycerol (DAG) and a phosphorylated head group, have received extensive attention owing to their involvement in cellular signal transduction in mammalian systems [1]. For example, DAG is a second messenger in these signaling cascades. The phosphatidylcholine (PC)-preferring PLC from Bacillus cereus (PLCBc ) (EC 3.1.4.3) is a member of this class of enzymes that has three zinc ions at its active site [2]. Because of its unusual trimetal center coupled with its antigenic similarity to a mammalian PLC [3], PLCBc has been the subject of numerous investigations to elucidate its structure, function and mechanism [4^10]. The e¤ciency with which PLCBc hydrolyzes PCs having di¡erent lengths of acyl side chains has been examined as a step toward establishing the essential features of substrate structure-activity relationships. These studies revealed that micellar substrates, which typically have side chains that each contain eight or more carbons, were hydrolyzed signi¢cantly faster than soluble ones; there was also a marked discontinuity in the rate curves at the critical micelle concentration (CMC) for a given substrate [11^14]. Because the interpretation of kinetic data obtained in heterogeneous systems can be problematic, mechanistic and kinetic studies are best performed with water-soluble PC derivatives, even though these may not be naturally occurring. Short-chain PCs with either six or seven carbons in each side chain exhibited comparable Km s (i.e. 0.36 and 0.20 mM, respectively) and Vmax s (1000 and 1340 WM/min/mg, respectively) in solution, whereas the corresponding lecithin with fur carbons in each chain was a much poorer substrate (Km = 40 mM, Vmax = 750 WM/min/mg) [12]. Thus, reducing the length of acyl side chains on soluble substrates results in a signi¢cant decrease in the catalytic e¤ciency of PLCBc , and the major e¡ect is to increase Km . Inasmuch as preorganization of the substrate could have an e¡ect upon the observed

Km s, we undertook a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study to compare the preferred structures in aqueous solutions of a series of short-chain PCs to ascertain whether there was any correlation between the solution structure of the substrate and the catalytic e¤ciency with which it was hydrolyzed by PLCBc . 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials The short-chain phospholipids 1,2-dihexanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (C6PC), 1,2-dibutanoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C4PC) and 1,2-dipropanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C3PC) (Fig. 1) were obtained in powder form (99% purity) from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). 1-(2-Pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN) dye was obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). PLCBc and alkaline phosphatase were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.2. NMR experiments The phospholipids were dissolved in 99% D2 O below their respective CMCs. The concentrations used were as follows: C3PC, 150 mM; C4PC, 75 mM and C6PC, 8 mM. The NMR experiments were performed on a Varian 500 MHz NMR with a triple resonance probe using the residual water peak at N 4.63 as the reference. The proton spectra were acquired with 64K points and a resolution of 0.10 Hz/ point. The heteronuclear long range coupling (HET-

LOC) experiments used the pulse sequence from Kessler [15]. The C3PC and C4PC spectra were acquired with 64 blocks of 448 increments, and the C6PC spectrum was taken with 102 blocks of 448 increments. Digital resolution for all HETLOC experiments was 0.41 Hz/point. The spectra were zero¢lled to 16K points for processing. 2.3. Determination of CMC The CMCs of C3PC and C4PC were determined in 96-well microtiter plates using a method based upon the solubilization of the dye PAN [16,17]. Brie£y, the concentrations of C3PC and C4PC were made up to a ¢nal volume of 50 Wl in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. The concentrations used for C3PC were varied from 80 to 475 mM; concentrations for C4PC were varied from 20 to 780 mM. In the 96-well microtiter plate, 5 Wl of 1.6 mM PAN solution in pentane was added to each phospholipid concentration. After 20 min, the pentane had evaporated and the color was fully developed; the absorbancy was then read at 470 nm. These absorbancies were graphed versus phospholipid concentration, and the CMC was determined from the intersection of the two lines according to the protocol of Furton [16]. 2.4. Kinetic assays of short-chain phospholipids Assays were performed in a 96-well format with PLCBc using a coupled chromogenic assay in which the phosphorylcholine product from the PLCBc -catalyzed hydrolysis of the soluble phospholipid is ¢rst hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase to liberate inorganic phosphate [8]. To quantitate the inorganic phosphate, a solution containing ammonium molybdate and ascorbic acid in trichloroacetic acid is added, followed by a second solution of sodium

metaarsenite and trisodium citrate in acetic acid. The development of the blue color from the resulting molybdenum-phosphate complex is complete after 20 min, and the microplate is read at 700 nm. The assays were performed at least three times each on separate days. The kinetic parameters were determined from a non-linear least-squares ¢t of the data by Kaleidagraph utilizing the equation, v = Vmax [S]/Km +[S]. 3. Results The CMCs of the short-chain PCs increase dramatically as the length of the side chains is reduced because the hydrophobic forces that drive micelle formation decrease. Using the PAN dye inclusion assay, the CMCs of C6PC, C4PC and C3PC were determined to be 8.1, 180 and 405 mM, respectively (Table 1). These values are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding values of 11.1 and s 150 mM obtained independently for C6PC and C4PC [12,18]. As expected, the catalytic e¤ciencies of PLCBc toward the soluble substrates C6PC, C4PC and C3PC decreased as the side chains were shortened, and the primary e¡ect was in the measured Km s (Table 1); the kcat remained relatively constant for all three substrates. The Km for C6PC was 2.4 mM, but when the side chains are shortened to four carbon atoms, the Km increased to 21.2 mM and to 61.0 mM for C3PC. The kinetic parameters determined in this study for C6PC and C4PC were in good qualitative agreement with those obtained in an earlier investigation in which an assay based upon a pH stat titration was used [12]. The NMR studies to probe the preferred conformations about the glycerol backbone in C6PC, C4PC and C3PC in aqueous solution were conducted in a

manner similar to those reported by Hauser [19,20]. The experiments were all performed in D2 O to correspond to the usual assay conditions. Moreover, the measurements were obtained at concentrations below the CMC of the PC to ensure that any packing of the side chains was due to hydrophobic forces and not to any intermolecular interactions or packing in a micelle structure. The 1 H NMR spectrum of C3PC, which is typical of the one-dimensional spectra obtained for C6PC and C4PC, is shown in Fig. 2. The assigned values for the chemical shifts and the observed vicinal coupling constants are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively, for the protons on the

glycerol backbones of C6PC, C4PC and C3PC (Fig. 1). Assuming that the three staggered conformations about the C(1)^C(2) bond (rotamers A^C) and the C(2)^C(3) bond (rotamers D^F) represent rapidly interconverting, minimum energy conformations (Fig. 3), it is possible to calculate the percentage of each conformer at equilibrium using the vicinal spinspin coupling constants. The coupling constant that is determined experimentally represents an average value that is derived from the component, threebond coupling constants, which are associated with each of the three conformations, weighted by the

The percentage of each rotamer in the two conformational families A^ C and D^F for each C6PC, C4PC and C3PC were then calculated, and the results are summarized in Table 4.

For the torsion angles de¢ning conformers A^C, the rotamer composition is based on the assumption that 3 JAC s 3 JBC . If 3 JBC s 3 JAC , rotamer C, in which the acyl side chains would be antiperiplanar thus not allowing the well-known parallel packing, would become signi¢cantly populated. For rotamers D^F, two sets of values are obtained for each rotamer depending upon whether 3 JCE s 3 JCD or 3 JCD s 3 JCE (in parentheses).

Correlating three-bond heteronuclear coupling constants with Karplus-like curves may also provide information regarding dihedral angles [24]. For example, information regarding the average dihedral angle about the C(1)^C(2) bond may be obtained from 3 JC3ÀHA and 3 JC3ÀHB , whereas the average dihedral angle about the C(2)^C(3) bond is derived from 3 JC1ÀHD and 3 JC1ÀHE . These heteronuclear coupling constants may be determined using a twodimensional HETLOC NMR experiment that provides total correlation spectra in which the signal for a proton is split into a doublet in each of the two frequency domains by a 13 C atom giving an E.COSY-like pattern. A region of such a spectrum corresponding to HA and HB of C3PC is shown in Fig. 4. The doublets observed for HA and HB in the F1 domain correspond to the heteronuclear onebond couplings 1 JC1ÀHA and 1 JC1ÀHB , and the doublets for HA and HB in the F2 domain result from the heteronuclear three-bond couplings 3 JC3ÀHA and 3 JC3ÀHB . The value for 3 JC3ÀHA is then determined by selecting a slice in the F1 domain

for each peak associated with HA and measuring the di¡erence in the chemical shifts in the F2 domain for the two peaks associated with HA (Fig. 5). The value of 3 JC3ÀHB was determined analogously. The values thus obtained for 3 JC3ÀHA and 3 JC3ÀHB for C3PC were 2.4 and 2.0 Hz, respectively (Table 3); similar

values were obtained for C4PC and C6PC (Table 3). However, because the signal-to-noise ratio in the later spectrum was high, the values for the two heteronuclear coupling constants are somewhat less reliable. Owing to the overlap of peaks for HD and HE , it was not possible to determine the coupling constants 3 JC1ÀHD and 3 JC1ÀHE using the HETLOC experiment. 4. Discussion The catalytic e¤ciency with which PLCBc hydrolyzes PC derivatives depends upon the length of the acyl side chains. Micellar substrates are hydrolyzed faster than monomolecular dissolved ones, and there is a marked discontinuity at the CMC at which a 3-fold increase is typically observed in the Vmax . For PCs containing six or seven carbon atoms in each side chain, the apparent Km for the soluble form is about 10 times higher than for the micellar form [11,12]. In the present work, we determined the kinetic parameters for the water-soluble PCs C6PC,

C4PC and C3PC. Although there was little variation in the measured kcat s, there was a 10^25-fold increase in the observed Km s as the acyl side chains were shortened (Table 1). There is therefore a signi¢cant decrease in the e¤ciency of the PLCBc -catalyzed hydrolysis of soluble PCs as the length of the side chains is decreased, and this loss of e¤ciency is manifested primarily in increases in Km . The objective of the present study was to probe the basis for this di¡erence in enzymatic e¤ciency by examining whether the preferred backbone conformations of soluble PCs varied as a function of side chain length. Because PC is the most abundant phospholipid in cellular and subcellular membranes, X-ray crystallography [25,26] and NMR [19,20,27^32] have been extensively utilized to determine the preferred conformation(s) of various PCs in di¡erent environments. In organized environments such as those imposed in micelles and liquid crystals, PCs adopt three-dimensional structures that are reasonably well-de¢ned. There is a clear preference about the C(1)^C(2) bond for rotamers A and B in which the hydrophobic acyl side chains pack in parallel conformations, but there is somewhat greater £exibility about the C(2)^C3) bond with rotamers D^F being more equally populated (Fig. 4). In solution, however, the molecules are not constrained by intermolecular packing forces, and there is potentially greater freedom for rotations about the glycerol backbone that would alter the relative orientations of the acyl side chains and the phosphate moiety of the head group. This increased £exibility in solution might lead to preferred structures di¡erent from those found in micelles and bilayers. Nevertheless, the parallel packing of the side chains clearly plays a major role in determining conformational preferences about the C(1)^C(2) bond of PCs both in solution and in micelles. However, it was not known whether PCs containing six or fewer carbon atoms in each side chain adopt the same preferred conformations. To address this important question, we performed a series of NMR experiments in D2 O to establish the conformational preferences about the glycerol backbone of the soluble PCs C6PC, C4PC and C3PC. The vicinal coupling constants for the protons on the glycerol backbones of C6PC, C4PC and C3PC were determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Table 3), and these average values were used to calculate

the fractional populations of the three staggered conformations about each of the C(1)^C(2) and C(2)^ C(3) bonds (Table 4). The conformational preferences are most easily derived from analysis of the vicinal couplings between the backbone protons. The data obtained from the heteronuclear, three-bond coupling constants 3 JC3ÀHA and 3 JC3ÀHB are also useful, but the experimentally determined values of these coupling constants represent an average derived from the fractional populations of the di¡erent rotamers A^C and the component, heteronuclear coupling constants, which unfortunately are unknown. Nevertheless, based upon the operative Karplus relationship, the expected heteronuclear coupling constant 3 JCH is 2.0 Hz for a dihedral angle of ( þ ) 60³ and 8.8 Hz for 180³ [24]. Thus, the observed coupling constants 3 JC3ÀHA and 3 JC3ÀHB for each of the short-chain PCs are consistent with preferred conformations in which there is an approximate ( þ ) 60³ relationship between C(3) and both HA and HB . The relative percentages of each rotamer for the short-chain PCs C6PC, C4PC and C3PC reveal that there is little di¡erence in the preferred solution conformation about the glycerol backbone as a function of side chain length. Thus, even though the intramolecular hydrophobic interactions were expected to decrease signi¢cantly in reducing the acyl side chain length from six to three carbons, any such decrease was not manifested in observable conformational changes. In each case, the dominant conformations about the C(1)^C(2) bond were A and B, which allow for hydrophobic interactions between the chains. There was a slight increase ( 6 5%) in the population of rotamer C for C4PC and C3PC relative to C6PC, but this change seems unlikely to account for the more dramatic 10^25-fold di¡erence observed in the catalytic e¤ciencies for these substrates. Although there is a slight preference for rotamer E, there is little di¡erence in the relative energies of the three possible staggered conformations about the C(2)^ C(3) bond for C6PC, C4PC and C3PC, suggesting that the length of the fatty acid side chain does not signi¢cantly e¡ect the orientation of the head group relative to the backbone. These ¢ndings are in good agreement with the literature data for the conformational preferences of C6PC in aqueous solution [19,20]. In this context, it is perhaps interesting to note that dominant conformer about the C(2)^C(3)

bond of 1,2-O-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in the liquid crystalline phase is rotamer D [30]. Decreases in the hydrophobic interactions arising from shorter side chains thus do not appear to in£uence signi¢cantly the orientations of substituents on the glycerol backbone of the soluble PCs in this study. Prior organization of the substrate in a conformation that interacts optimally with the enzyme active site then seems an unlikely explanation for the observed decrease in the catalytic e¤ciency of PLCBc toward soluble substrates. It should be noted, however, that these experiments explored only whether side chain length e¡ected the conformation of the glycerol backbone and not whether there were changes in how the side chains packed. Such e¡ects could be explored by nOe (NOESY) studies, but because of the magnetic equivalence of protons on the two side chains in the unlabeled PCs, it was not possible to distinguish unambiguously intrachain interactions from interchain interactions. Thus, the question is now: if an internal hydrophobic e¡ect is not involved, what is responsible for the large increase in Km that is observed in the PLCBc -catalyzed hydrolysis of soluble PCs having acyl side chains of decreasing lengths? Examination of the crystal structure of PLCBc complexed with the phosphonate inhibitor 3(S),4-dihexanoyloxybutyl-1-

phosphonylcholine, which has six carbons in the side chains, reveals that the ammonium ion of the choline moiety lies in a pocket formed by Glu-4, Tyr-56 and Phe-66 (Fig. 6) [5]. In this structure, the conformations about the C(1)^C(2) and C(2)^C(3) bonds of the bound inhibitor correspond to rotamers B and F. The only close contact observed between an acyl side chain on the substrate and the enzyme in this structure was between the methyl groups of Leu135 and C(5) of the sn-2 side chain, and this distance î was approximately 3.9 A ; another possible contact î ) is with C(6) on the side chain. (4.5 A Because there did not appear to be more extensive interactions between the inhibitor and PLCBc , we originally discounted the possibility that hydrophobic interactions between the acyl side chains of a substrate and residues on the enzyme would contribute signi¢cantly to binding and catalytic e¤ciency. On closer inspection of the X-ray data of this complex, however, it may be seen that there is considerable thermal motion associated with the acyl side chains, especially the sn-1 chain, and so it is quite possible that the side chains of Phe-66, which is î about 4.4 A from C(4) of the sn-2 chain, and perhaps î Phe-70, which is about 4.2 A from C(2) of the sn-2 side chain, could be involved in binding the acyl side chains of either the substrate or the product DAG. In the absence of these favorable interactions, Km could increase. Thus, the combined hydrophobic interactions between Leu-135, Phe-66 and Phe-70 and a substrate (or inhibitor) could play an important role in recognition and/or binding. Moreover, it is necessary to carefully examine and evaluate the solvation/desolvation e¡ects associated with the complexation of di¡erent soluble PC substrates with PLCBc . The basis of the observed hydrophobic e¡ect upon catalytic e¤ciency of PLCBc is presently the subject of a series of studies, the results of which will be reported in due course.
