Introduction The Hub1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NESG ID: YTYst190 / PIR: S78735/ GI: 7493880) is a ubiquitin-like modifier protein (UBL) that is essential for proper cell polarization during the formation of mating projections in S. cerevisiae. Hub1 conjugation to the cell polarity factors Sph1 and Hbt1 is required for their proper subcellular localization [1]. Hub1 belongs to a conserved family of eukaryotic proteins. S. cerevisiae and human Hub1 share 65% identity. The sequence identity with ubiquitin is 22%. Here we describe the solution structure of Hub1 determined by NMR spectroscopy. We compare the structure of Hub1 to ubiquitin and find that although the overall fold is almost identical, critical surface residues in ubiquitin are not conserved in Hub1. These differences probably reflect the different functions of the UBL Hub1. nus (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH). NMR samples of approximately 1.5 mM uniformly 15N/ 13Clabeled Hub1 were prepared in 10 mM NaOAc, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 10 µM Zn 2 , 1 mM benzamidine, 1 x inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.01% (w/v) NaN 3 in 10% (v/v) 2 H 2O/H 2O at pH 5.0. This buffer was not optimized to determine the importance of any components. Samples were placed in 5-mm Shigemi susceptibilitymatched NMR tubes. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 oC on 600, 750, and 800 MHz Varian Inova spectrometers. Chemical shifts were referenced to external DSS [3]. Backbone and side chain assignments were made using the following triple resonance experiments recorded on [U- 15N, U- 13C]-Hub1: 3D HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NNH [4,5], HNHA [6-8], HCCH-TOCSY [9], HCC-TOCSY-NNH [10,11], and CC-TOCSYNNH [10,12,13]. NOE restraints were derived from 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC ( m 150 ms) [4,14], 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC ( m 120 ms) [15], and 4D CC-NOESY ( 2H 2O, m 120 ms) [16] experiments. Two-dimensional 1H- 15N-HSQC [4,14] and 1 H- 13C-HSQC [4,17] spectra were recorded in H 2O and 1H- 15N-HSQC were recorded at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after a lyophilized sample was redissolved in 2 H 2O. Stereospecific valine and leucine methyl group assignments were obtained from a 1H- 13C-HSQC spectrum recorded on [U- 15N, 10% 13C]-Hub1

Materials and methods The YNR032c-a/HUB1 gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and inserted into a pET15b (Novagen) vector. This construct yields the Hub1 protein with a N-terminal His 6-tag and thrombin cut site. The protein expression and purification method are described by Yee et al. [2]. The His tag was not cleaved, leaving an extra 20 residues at the N-termi-

26 prepared by growing E. coli in M9 medium containing 10% [U- 13C]-glucose [18]. Spectra were processed with Felix (MSI) and analyzed with Sparky (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/ sparky). Chemical shifts of 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances have been deposited in BioMagResBank (BMRB) under accession code 5481. Sequential NOE crosspeaks were characterized as strong (1.8­2.5 Å), medium (1.8­3.5 Å), or weak (1.8­5 Å) and given the corresponding distance restraints. Medium and long range NOEs were given the longest restraint, unless they were very intense (1.8­4 Å). Pseudoatom correction of 1 Å for methyls and methylenes, 2.4 Å for nonstereospecifically assigned Leu and Val methyl groups, or 2.0 Å for equivalent aromatic protons were added to the upper bounds. Dihedral angle restraints for were derived from the HNHA experiment (57 25 o for J < 6 Hz and -139 40 o for J > 8 Hz). In addition restraints of -100 80 o were applied for residues for which the d N NOE was clearly weaker than the d N (i, i 1) NOE for a given H N [19]. Dihedral restraints for were added when preliminary structure calculations clearly indicated helix or strand secondary structure (-47 30 o or 140 40 o). Hydrogen bond restraints were added for slowly exchanging amide protons for which an acceptor could be identified from preliminary structures (d NO 2.8­3.3 Å and d HN 1.8­2.3 Å). NOE and dihedral restraint tables in X-PLOR format are deposited in the BMRB (code 5481). Selected classes of NOEs and 2H 2O exchange data are shown in Figure 1. A total of 783 distance restraints and 86 dihedral restraints were used in the structure calculations using the standard XPLOR-3.84 (20) routines dg_subembed.inp, dg_full_embed.inp, dgsa.inp, and refine_ gentle.inp. The 20 calculated structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession code 1M94. The backbone trace of the ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures in shown in Figure 2A, and the structural statistics are compiled in Table 1. Ramachandran analysis was performed using PROCHECK-NMR (21).

Results and discussion The Hub1 protein has the ubiquitin-like or -grasp fold (Figure 2B). The secondary structural elements are ­ ­ ­ ­ ­3 10­ along the sequence (Figure 1). The five ­strands form a mixed -sheet with the strand arranged in the order 2-1-5-3-4. Strands 1 and 5 are parallel, and the rest are antiparallel. The first helix is the longest with 3.5 turns and fits in the curve inside the -sheet. The second helix is only four residues long and has the hydrogen bonding pattern of a 3 10-helix. Residues 8-11, 38-40, and 47-48 appear less structured. These residues are located in loops and have few NOEs other than sequential or intraresidue NOEs. Backbone H N resonances could not be found for residues G47,G48, or residues Nterminal to M1 in 1H- 15N-HSQC spectra. The structure most similar to Hub1 according to a Dali [22] search of the PDB is ubiquitin (PDB id

Below the sequence are arrows and spirals indicating the location of -strands and helices from the final structure. Stars indicate residues with observable slow 1H / 2H exchange rates at the backbone amide. Filled circles identify residues with 3J HNH > 8 Hz, and half circles correspond to 3J HNH < 6 Hz. For sequential NOEs, thin, medium, and thick bars indicate whether the NOE was weak, medium, or strong. Medium range NOEs are indicated by lines connecting the two residues involved in the NOE. 13C chemical shifts relative to the random coil values C are at the bottom, with positive values are downfield shifts.

1UBI, Z 19.2). The backbone r.m.s.d. between Hub1 (residues 2-72) and the crystal structure of human ubiquitin (1UBI, residues 1-71) is about 1.0 Å. Hub1 has one additional residue at the N-terminus and ubiquitin has four extra residues at the C-terminus which form an unstructured tail. The lengths of secondary structural elements are the same. Like ubiquitin, Hub1 contains a parallel -bulge at the beginning of strand 5. It is unclear if Hub1 contains a second -bulge observed in ubiquitin at the beginning of strand 2 because the loop between strands 1 and 2 is not well defined. Although the overall sequence similarity between Hub1 and ubiquitin is 47% (based on Dali alignment), much higher similarity (80%, 12/15 residues) occurs for the residues with buried side chains. The electrostatic surface of Hub1 is highly charged and unlike ubiquitin contains no large hydrophobic patches (Figure 3). The side chains in ubiquitin which form one hydrophobic patch required for proteasome degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (L8, I44, and V70) [23] are not conserved in Hub1 suggesting that Hub1 does not share this function with ubiquitin. This is

consistent with the observation that the levels of Hbt1 and Sph1 were not affected by conjugation to Hub1 and are therefore not being targeted for degradation [1]. Another surface region of ubiquitin (F4) is required for endocytosis [24]. The corresponding residue in Hub1 (V5) could be involved in a similar function. Like ubiquitin, Hub1 can form poly-conjugated species. In S. cerevisiae, overexpression of Hub1 L73 resulted in formation of multiple highmolecular-weight conjugates (1). Chains of polyubiquitin connected through three lysine residues (K29, K48, and K63) have been found in S. cerevisiae. Hub1 has eight conserved surface lysine residues which may be involved in polymerization. Only K12 and K28 have corresponding residues in ubiquitin. The function of Hub1 conjugation and multiple chain lengths in higher eukaryotes remains to be determined. Key differences between Hub1 and other UBLs also occur at the C-terminus. Typically, UBL proteins are cleaved after the ­Gly­Gly­ motif to achieve the mature form which becomes attached covalently to

other proteins at the Gly C-terminus. Instead, Hub1 contains a conserved ­Tyr­Tyr­ motif followed by one unconserved residue at the C-terminus. A recent study of overexpressed Hub1 and Hub1 L73 mutants in hub1 deficient yeast suggests that posttranslational cleavage of L73 is necessary for conjugation [1]. Hub1 Y72 L73 was unable to form conjugates, sug-

gesting that the Y72 C-terminus is conjugated to proteins after the cleavage [1]. While the ­Gly­Gly­ motif of ubiquitin is in an unstructured tail, the ­Tyr­ Tyr­ motif in Hub1 is at the end of strand 5. The H N of Y71 forms a hydrogen bond with V43 in strand 3, and the side chain of Y72 is partially buried in the interior of the protein. The enzymes involved in

cleavage and conjugation of Hub1 remain to be indentified, as do the interacting proteins involved in targeting Hub1 conjugates to the proper subcellular location. Despite the highly similar folds of Hub1 and ubiquitin, differences in the C-termini and surface residues may account for the different functions of the two proteins.
