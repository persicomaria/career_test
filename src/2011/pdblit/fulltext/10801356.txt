Key Word Index--Solenopsis; hexokinase; aminopeptidase; isozymes. Abstract--Alate females were collected from monogynous and polygynous Solenopsis invicta colonies in
four Texas counties. The two forms were sympatric in two of the counties, and were separated by half a mile and two miles respectively in the other two counties. The alate females from each colony were subjected to electrophoresis in horizontal starch gels and stained for hexokinase and aminopeptidase. Both systems revealed electromorphs in the polygynous population which were not present in the monogynous population. A unique slow hexokinase electromorph was present in 83% of the polygynous alates, while a unique slow aminopeptidase electromorph was present in 46% of the polygynous female alates. No evidence of nest queen pheromonal control over production of the unique isozymes was found. Other nongenetic explanations for the presence of electromorphs unique to polygynous populations are addressed.

Introduction Solenopsis invicta Buren, the red imported fire ant (IFA), was accidently introduced from South America into the United States about 50 years ago [1]. It has since spread to at least 11 southern states [2]. For many years this species was thought to be exclusively monogynous [3]. Between 1973 and 1980, however, polygyny was established as a common feature of IFA populations in several states [4-6]. The presence of both monogynous (M) and polygynous (P) forms within an ant species is well known [e.g. 7] and is often associated with genetic differentiation [8, 9]. The appearance of P S. invicta populations in North America has raised some interesting questions about the IFA's history. Has the P form evolved in the southern United States, in the past 50 years, as Ross et al. [10], and Ross and Fletcher [11-13], have suggested? If so, how did it evolve? Is the P form a subset of the total IFA population or could the P colony organization scheme be the result of hybridization between the M-IFA and another Solenopsis? Hybridization occurs in a wide range of animal taxa [e.g. 14, 15] and is known to occur in this subgenus [16, 17]. Alternatively, the P form, like the M form, could be a separate introduction into the U.S. Ross et al. [13] surveyed isozyme variability in IFA samples collected in eight southern states. They reported nine polyrnorphic loci, but used only two of these in their subsequent work [11-13]. Their conclusion that the M and P forms were derived one from the other within the last 50 years is based on the similarity of these two loci among the M and P forms. There are, however, morphological and behavioral differences between these two forms [18]. The present study of enzyme variability in Texas IFA was initiated in the hope that some new information would be found which would shed light on the relationship between M- and P-IFA forms. This paper documents two isozyme electromorphs which are unique to P S. invicta in Texas. One electromorph is a hexokinase isozyme, and the other is an isozyme of aminopeptidase. This is the first report of electrophoretic mobility differences in isozymes from M and P S. invicta populations.

Materials and Methods
Solenopsis invicta colonies were sampled in Brazos, Burleson, Galveston and Waller Counties, in central and east Texas. An effort was made to locate sites where M- and P-IFA are in close proximity. Monogynous and polygynous forms were found within a few feet of one another in Brazos and 13urlesonCounties: they were separated by half a mile at the Waller County site, and by about two miles in GalvestonCounty. Colonieswere classified as M or P according to criteria suggested by Greenberg etal. [18]. Alates used for analysis were sampled in severalways. During mating flight activity, cageswere placed over mounds and reproductiveswere trapped as they attempted to fly from the nests. At times when mating flights were not occurring and when caging mounds was not practical,tops of mounds were scraped away and alates were either collected with an aspirator or the mound soil containing the alates was brought back fo the laboratory in plastic ziplock bags. Some colonies were collected in 5-gallon plastic buckets in order to capture the nest queens. Alate sampleswere either: analysedwithin 2 h of collection; frozen in liquid nitrogen within 2 h of collection; held in the laboratory for two days; or maintained for several weeks in artificial nests with several queens (in the case of P forms) with workers and brood. At least six alate females from each colony were homogenized individually in 50 p,Iof homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 1 mg ml-~ NAD and NADP: 1 BI ml 1 ~-mercaptoethanol). The homogenates were subjected to electrophoresis in horizontal starch gels using standard methodology [19]. Hexokinase(EC 2.7.1.1) was resolved using 0.38 M Tris/0.13 M citric acid, pH 7.5 electrode buffer; gel buffer = 1:30 dilution. Aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1)was resolved using Tris-citrate gel and electrode buffers [19]. Both enzymes were stained using standard methods [19]. The hexokinasestain was prepared in a 1.5%agar solution and applied to the gel slice as an agar overlay. The role of nest queens in expression of unique electromorphs was examined as follows. Nine P colonies with over 10 dealates and seven M colonies with their physogastricnest queen were collected in BrazosCounty and maintained in the laboratory for two months confirming each had a functional nest queen. All were producing female reproductives and worker broods. Alate virgin females were removed from each colony 18-24 h before homogenization and maintained in separate artificial nests with water, honey water and artificial diet. As a control, six additional alate virgin females were removed from each colony 30 min prior to homogenization. Alates from both groups were homogenized at the same time, and the enzymes separatedon the same gels. Solenopsis gerninata samples were collected in Travis, Bell, Blanco, Burnet, Lampassas and Val Verde Counties in Texas, samples of Solenopsis xyloni were collected in Bell, Blanco and Val Verde Counties. Additional M S, invicta colonies were collected in Burleson and P S. invicta in BrazosCounty. Solenopsis richteri was collected north of Amory, Mississippi (north Monroe County) well north of the S. invicta or S, invictaS. richteri hybrid zone [17].

M = monogynous, P = polygynous; HK = hexokinase, AP = aminopeptidase. HK zone II has three electromorphs in Texas IFA; the slowest migrating isozyme is unique to the polygynous form. The AP zone n activity appears to be the product of a locus which is expressed only in polygynous individuals.

zone II electromorph and 0.39-0.55 for the AP zone II electromorph. The unique electrornorphs were not found in any of the 204 M individuals sampled from 34 colonies from the four sites. The difference in M and P population phenotypes was significant at the 0.01 level within each county and overall for both HK zone II and AP zone II (X2 = 338 and 140, respectively). There was significant heterogeneity among P populations for both HK zone II and AP zone II frequencies (heterogeneity chi-squares equal 5.0 and 30.5, respectively). This heterogeneity reflects population subdivision (see Discussion). For the results presented here it is important to note that M and P populations show significantly different frequencies within each county and overall. The greatest overall difference between the HK and AP frequencies occurred for the sympatric populations in Brazos and Robertson Counties (X2 = 159.8 and 117.9, respectively). The population separated by half a mile in Waller County showed the next greatest difference (7.2 = 106.7), while the Galveston County populations separated by two miles showed the least difference (7.2= 99.8). The effects of on~ or several functional nest queens on hexokinase zone II and aminopeptidase zone II expression are summarized in Table 2. Neither the M control individuals (female alates held with a single M queen) nor those separated and held away from their nest queen showed any activity for the HK or AP unique variants. In contrast, the Palate females separated from their nest queens and individuals sampled from colonies with queens produced both HK zone II and AP zone II unique electromorphs, and the electromorph frequencies were the same in the control (alate female in colonies with several functional queens) as in those separated from their nest queens (7.2= 0.121). There was no evidence that the unique electromorphs were introduced by hybridization. None of the three other species of Solenopsis examined had either the HK zone II or AP zone II unique electromorphs found in the P form of S. invicta (Table 3).

Discussion One of the fundamental observations of population genetics is that populations that are intermating share a common pool of alleles. This follows as a direct consequence of the flow of genes that occurs among the populations during panmixis. The discovery of electrophoretic variants that occur consistently in polygynous Solenopsis invicta populations, but not in monogynous populations, is therefore significant. If the electromorphs can be shown to have genetic bases, they could become powerful tools in the study of these two fire ant types. If some physiological explanation is found, the results could be equally important in understanding gene expression. It has been suggested (K. G. Ross, personal communication) that both M- and P-IFA populations could carry the gene for the unique hexokinase electromorph and that, if true, the gene could be expressed or not expressed in individuals from either group according to environmental or physiological factors. Specifically, Ross suggests that alates in the presence of one or more functional nest queens do not produce the unique isozyme, and the alates removed from the influence of nest queens for 12-24 h would have a new zone of hexokinase activity. Under this model, an inhibitory substance produced by the nest queen(s) [20] prevents the production of the unique isozyme; inhibition is removed when alates are separated from the queen, and the protein is produced. If this is the case, the observed phenotype distributions could be the result of biased sampling protocols and not real differences between M and P populations. To examine these possibilities, M and P colonies were maintained in the laboratory in order to determine whether some queen-produced factor affected hexokinase electromorph production. The maintenance of alates in the presence or absence of queen(s) had no effect on HK zone II phenotype expression (see Table 2i. Alate females that were produced by M colonies and were kept isolated from their nest queen for 24 h prior to homogenization and electrophoresis showed no unique electromorph activity, while 91% of the Palate females maintained in the presence of their nest queens until 30 min before homogenization (the P control group) had the unique HK electromorph. Both of these observations contradict a queen factor hypothesis. If a queen-mediated factor prevents production of this protein, then the Palates which were maintained with their nest queens until shortly before homogenization should have no unique electromorph activity. Conversely, the M alates that were isolated from their queen for 24 h should have the unique electromorph. There was also no evidence for queen factor involvement in the production of the unique aminopeptidase electromorph in alates from P colonies in the controlled study. Whether the Palates were separated from their nest queens or maintained with several P queens, the two different unique electromorphs were observed. In contrast, M alates held with their M queen or maintained individually failed to express the unique electromorph. The varied collection and sample treatment methods used for this study provide further evidence against the effect of a nest or queen factor on the expression of the unique electromorphs. Reproductives that were collected as they flew (mature alates)

or aspirated from a disturbed mound (of varied age), whether electrophoresed within 2 h of collection or held together with or without workers for several days, produced M and P hexokinase and aminopeptidase expression patterns equivalent to these in the controlled study. Isozyme patterns such as those reported here could result if samples taken from one population were consistently of one age group and those taken from the other were of another age group, and if the expression of the two enzymes was agedependent. Hung et al. [21] reported that 0¢-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase-1 isozymes were not active until two days post-emergence in female IFA alates. Although a controlled study of age dependency of hexokinase and aminopeptidase expression in the IFA was not performed, the varied collecting methods employed reduce the likelihood of consistently sampling discrete age groups from the two populations. Further, alates trapped in cages as they were leaving their nests during mating flights are considered mature [22, 23] and the differences between M and P electromorph patterns in these collections should therefore be regarded as significant. Correlations between electromorph frequencies and environmental factors have also been reported in a variety of organisms [e.g. 24, 25]. This raises the possibility that the unique HK and AP electromorphs could have initially been present in both M and P populations at low frequency, and some external environmental factor caused their frequencies to increase in the P populations. The data presented here argue against this possibility, The Brazos and Burleson County, TX, collecting sites had M and P colonies in close proximity and expressed the greatest HK II and AP II frequency differences between the M and P form. If external environment influences HK II and AP II electromorph frequencies in IAF populations, then a factor that acts in a positive way on P colonies either has no effect or acts in the opposite direction on M colonies. The presence of the HK II or AP II electromorph, or both, in one of the other Solenopsis species would have suggested that the P form of S. invicta could have originated as a hybrid. No evidence to support this hypothesis was found. Perhaps the best explanation for the appearance of polygynous S. invicta in the Texas population is that it originated as a separate introduction from another country. It must be emphasized that these results are preliminary. Statements regarding IFA populations structure which consider these isoenzymes cannot be made until the genetic basis of the enzymes has been determined.
