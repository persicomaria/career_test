Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the Escherichia coli tyrosine aminotransferase
Tyrosine aminotransferase catalyzes transamination for both dicarboxylic and aromatic amino-acid substrates. The substrate-free Escherichia coli tyrosine aminotransferase (eTAT) bound with the cofactor pyridoxal 5H -phosphate (PLP) was crystallized in the trigonal space group P32. A low-resolution crystal structure of eTAT was determined by molecular-replacement methods. The overall folding of eTAT resembles that of the aspartate aminotransferases, with the two identical subunits forming a dimer in which each monomer binds a PLP molecule via a covalent bond linked to the 4-NH2 group of Lys258. Comparison of the structure of eTAT with those of the open, half-open or closed form of chicken or E. coli aspartate aminotransferases shows the eTAT structure to be in the open conformation.

1. Introduction
Tyrosine aminotransferase (l-tyrosine± 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase; E.C. 2.6.1.5) is a pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzyme which catalyzes the transamination reactions in the catabolic pathways for aromatic amino acids (Dietrich, 1992). In the reactions catalyzed by tyrosine aminotransferase, the -amino group of l-tyrosine (or l-phenylalanine) is transferred to 2-oxoglutarate to yield p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (or phenylpyruvate) and l-glutamate. The E. coli tyrosine aminotransferase (eTAT) encoded by the tyrB gene shares 40±50% sequence identity with aspartate aminotransferases (AATs), which constitute one of the best studied subfamilies of enzymes (Mehta et al., 1989). AATs are homodimers comprised of two identical subunits, each with a molecular mass of 40± 50 kDa. They catalyze the reversible transfer of an amino group speci®cally between dicarboxylic amino-acid substrates (aspartate or glutamate) and oxoacid substrates (oxaloacetate or 2-oxoglutarate). The crystal structures of the mitochondrial or cytosolic AATs from chicken or pig were determined more than a decade ago (Christen & Metzler, 1985; Jansonius & Vicent, 1987; Torchinsky, 1986). These structures show that each subunit of AAT contains a large domain and a small domain, and that the active site is located at the interface between these two domains. The binding of the substrate induces the enzyme to change its conformation from an open form to a closed form, in which the small domain shifts toward the active site, closing the substrate-binding pocket (Picot et al., 1991; Rhee et al., 1997).

AATs catalyze the transamination of dicarboxylate substrates ef®ciently, but are poor enzymes for aromatic substrates. On the other hand, eTAT has a broader substrate speci®city: it can use not only dicarboxylate substrates but also aromatic substrates such as l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan or the corresponding oxoacids. Here, we report the crystallization and low-resolution crystal structure of eTAT bound with a cofactor pyridoxal 5H -phosphate (PLP). Structural comparison between eTAT and the open/ closed form of chicken mitochondrial AAT (McPhalen et al., 1992) or half-open E. coli AAT (Jager et al., 1994; Kamitori et al., 1990; Smith et al., 1989) shows that the substrate-free eTAT has a tertiary structure similar to the open form of AAT.

2. Materials and methods
The E. coli tyrB gene which encodes the tyrosine aminotransferase (eTAT) was isolated from the plasmid pTC29 (Liu et al., 1990) and was subcloned into the expression vector pG408N under the control of ! PL promoter. The resulting plasmid was designated pTC3 (Wu et al., 1998). For overexpression of the tyrB gene, E. coli N4830-1 (Pharmacia, Uppsala), which contains a temperaturesensitive ! repressor cI857, was used as the host. The pTC3-transformed cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 1 mM pyridoxine and 100 mg mlÀ1 of ampicillin at 303 K. As soon as the culture reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6, the temperature was shifted to 315 K and cells were permitted to grow for an

additional 6 h to induce the overproduction of eTAT. The cellular DNA present in the crude extract was removed by precipitation with 0.2% protamine sulfate. The protein solution was then subjected to heat treatment at 327 K for 10 min. The soluble protein was puri®ed by ammonium sulfate precipatation at 20±65% saturation, followed by chromatography using a phenylSepharose CL-4B and a hydroxyapatite column. The eTAT protein washed out in the last elution step was collected and concentrated by ultra®ltration to about 5 mg mlÀ1.

Single crystals of the eTAT protein were prepared using the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion method at room temperature. Drops containing 2.5 mg mlÀ1 eTAT, 8%(w/v) PEG 8000, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ¯uoride, 0.05 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.05 mM PLP and 12.5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) were equilibrated against a reservoir of 10% PEG 8000. Under these conditions, long rod-shaped crystals appeared in about three weeks. A large (0.6 Â 0.3 Â 0.3 mm) eTAT crystal was ¯ash-cooled to 123 K and diffracted X-rays Ê anisotropically to 3.2 A resolution along the Ê c axis and to about 5 A in the ab plane using in-house or synchrotron X-ray radiation. Data were collected using a R-AXIS II imaging-plate detector equipped with a mirror-focused system and a Rigaku RU-300 rotating-anode generator and were processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Since the crystal diffracted anisotropically, an ellipsoidal Ê sphere with a resolution limit of 3.5 A at the Ê c axis and 5.5 A at the a and b axes was imposed on the re¯ection images prior to scaling. This data set contained 13 117 unique re¯ections from 65 956 observations, giving an Rmerge of 9.3% and a completeness of 88.5% in the ellipsoidal re¯ection subspace. The crystal belonged to space group P31 or P32 with unit-cell dimensions Ê a = b = 126.6, c = 156.2 A. Assuming three TAT dimers per asymmetric unit, Vm is Ê 2.7 A3 DaÀ1. The low resolution of the data was partially a consequence of the large size of the unit cell, which contained three dimers, i.e. 2382 (397 Â 6) amino-acid residues, in one asymmetric unit. Molecular-replacement calculations and subsequent crystallographic re®nement

The stereoview of the electron-density map (2Fo À Fc) of E. coli tyrosine aminotransferase in the region of the central -sheet of the large PLP-binding domain. The calculated phases were obtained by the molecularreplacement method using a dimeric chicken mitochondrial AAT as a model and were modi®ed using the program DM (Cowtan & Main, 1996) using solvent ¯attening, histogram matching and sixfold averaging of the NCS-related molecules.

È were carried out using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). A self-rotational search showed several non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) twofold axes in the ab plane, perpendicular to the c axis, which made angles at intervals of 7.5 (0, Æ7.5, Æ15.0 and Æ22.5 ) with the a axis. The peak heights decreased as the angle increased. No signi®cant rotational solutions were identi®ed when the half-open or closed form of AAT were used as search models. However, cross-rotations using the open-form dimeric chicken mitochondrial AAT with all side chains included (PDB entry 7aat) as a search model yielded two strong peaks at (1, 2, 3) = (0, 91, 271 ) for the ®rst dimer and (0, 91, 254 ) for the second dimer. This result was consistent with the self-rotation solutions; the molecular dyad was aligned with the a axis (0 ) for the ®rst dimer and was shifted 15.0 away from the a axis for the second dimer. Moreover, the ®rst dimer was related to the second dimer by a twofold axis 7.5 from the a axis. The third orientation (0,90, 285 ) was one of the weaker peaks in the top 20 peak list and was identi®ed because it was also consistent with the selfrotation result. The molecular dyad for the third dimer was À15.0 away from the a axis and was related to the ®rst dimer by a twofold axis at À7.5 from the a axis. A translational search in space group P32 with the three orientations showed peaks of 10, 7 and 4' above the mean value, which were 6, 4 and 1.5' higher, respectively, than the next peaks. Three dimers in the asymmetric unit were centered at (x, y, z) = (0.026, 0.053, 0), (0.667, 0.328, 0.013) and (0.327, 0.667, 0.077): almost exactly at the threefold screw axes. They gave reasonable packing in the trigonal unit cell and thus precluded a fourth dimer in the asymmetric unit. No signi®cant translational peaks were observed when space group P31 was employed. With the small and the large domains re®ned separately, rigid-body re®nement of the three dimeric AAT molecules in the asymmetric unit of the P32 space group gave an R value of 0.42 for the entire data set. Upon simulated annealing with X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992), this heterogeneous model gave an R value of 0.23 for 92% of the data included in the re®nement and an Rfree of 0.33 for the 8% test data set. The model provided initial phase angles for the density modi®cation (DM) procedure in CCP4 (Cowtan & Main, 1996). In addition to solvent ¯attening and histogram matching, sixfold molecular averaging with separate large and small domains was also employed. The quality of the DM map was superior, mostly because of the sixfold averaging, and

numbering of pig cytosolic AAT (Ovchinnikov et al., 1973); the amino-acid residues in the opposite subunit are indicated with an asterisk. In this way, comparison of different AATs and TATs is more straightforward. The overall structure of eTAT (see Fig. 2) is similar to those of the higher animals' AAT, in which each subunit contains a small domain, a large domain and a N-terminal tail (residues 5±15). The large PLP-binding domain (residues 48±326) contains one PLP molecule, which forms an internal aldimine bond with the residue Lys258. The small domain is constituted of an N-terminal peptide (residues 16±47) and a C-terminal peptide (residues 327±408). The two domains are connected by a long -helix (helix 13), which stretches from the centre of the large domain to the top of the small domain. The N-terminal arm extends from the small domain to wrap around the large domain, which stabilizes the dimer conformation. The topology of eTAT is similar to that of AATs, in which the large domain contains typical  motifs folded into a central seven-stranded -sheet surrounded by three -helices. The small domain contains two small -sheets and ®ve helices. AATs exhibit signi®cant rearrangement of their domain structure upon substrate binding. In the absence of substrates, AATs adopt an `open conformation'. The binding of the substrate induces the small domain to rotate relative to the large domain, forming the `closed conformation'. In chicken or pig AAT, the small domain rotates about 13 on changing from an open to a closed conformation (McPhalen et al., 1992; Rhee et al., 1997). However, in the absence of a substrate, the structure of E. coli AAT is in a `half-open conformation', and the small domain rotates through 5±6 to form the closed conformation on binding a substrate (Jager et al., 1994; Okamoto et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1989). The reasons for the reduced domain rotation for the eAAT compared with the higher animal AATs are not clear. We found that the crystal structure of eTAT best matches the open-conformation AAT. Least-squares ®ts were performed using the program O for all C atoms in one subunit, with a stringent distance cutoff of Ê 1.0 A, in which only the closely matched C atoms were used for ®tting. In this method of ®tting, the root-mean-square deviations Ê between eTAT and AATs are 0.676 A for the open-form chicken mAAT (PDB entry Ê code 7aat), 0.662 A for the unliganded Ê eAAT (1asn) and 0.652 A for the inhibitorbound hexamutant eAAT (1ahx), for 132, 129 and 120 matched atom pairs, respecActa Cryst.

clearly showed the density of the backbone, side chains and PLP molecule (see Fig. 1). The model was then modi®ed by substituting and adjusting the side chains and inserting Gly66. The new model was re®ned again

using X-PLOR and new maps were produced using DM iteratively. Throughout the re®nement, NCS restraints were imposed on the model. Because the exact subunit conformations (open or closed) were initially uncertain, the NCS groups were divided into large and small domains. When a convergent model was reached, all six subunits assumed identical open conformations. Least-squares ®tting of C coordinates in the six large domains gave r.m.s. deviations of Ê 0.008±0.014 A, while ®tting the whole Ê subunit gave 0.11±0.25 A for all atoms. Therefore, subsequent cycles of re®nement employed a strict NCS constraint with only a single subunit model. The ®nal model contained one eTAT and one PLP molecule, 3080 non-H atoms in total, and yielded an R value of 0.213 (92% data) and a Rfree of 0.260 (8% data) based on 12 071 re¯ections having F/'(F) > 2. No solvent molecules were included; however, the bulk-solvent setup of X-PLOR was used. The average Ê temperature factor was 56.2 A2, with a range Ê 2. Atoms having B factors larger of 40±73 A Ê than 70 A2 were located in residues 10±29 and 347±348, including helix 1 and the loop between helices 13 and 14. The r.m.s. deviations of bond lengths and bond angles Ê from ideal values were 0.007 A and 1.22 , respectively. Statistics are listed in Table 1.
