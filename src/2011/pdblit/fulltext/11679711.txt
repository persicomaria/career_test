Cubic F432 crystals of recombinant mouse L-chain apoferritin were obtained by the hanging-drop technique with ammonium sulfate and cadmium sulfate as precipitants. The structure was Ê re®ned to 2.1 and 1.6 A resolution from data obtained at room temperature and under cryogenic conditions, respectively. The structure of an eight-amino-acid loop insertion in the mouse sequence is found to be highly disordered both at room temperature and at low temperature.

1. Introduction
Ferritin, the ubiquitous iron-storage protein, has been largely investigated, but unravelling the different features of the structure±function relationships in this protein is still a matter of concern (for reviews, see Harrison & Arosio, 1996; Harrison et al., 1998; Chasteen & Harrison, 1999). Its three-dimensional multimeric structure, which was determined 20 y ago (Clegg et al., 1980), and its heteropolymeric composition in vertebrates (Adelman et al., 1975) as well as the multiple active sites (iron entry-route channels, ferroxidase centre, mineral nucleation site) are some of the major factors which account for the complexity of its function. Ferritins are multimeric proteins consisting of 24 subunits. Each of them (15±20 kDa) consists of a four (a, b, c, d) -helix bundle to which a ®fth small -helix e is attached at the C-terminal end. The 24 subunits assemble in a 432 point symmetry. The multimer has a spherical shape (diameter 120± Ê Ê 130 A), with an inner cavity of about 80 A diameter; this cavity can host up to 4500 iron ions stored as hydrous ferric oxide. Natural ferritins isolated from vertebrates are heteropolymers made of various types of subunits, named H, L or M, with different sequences, whereas bacterial and plant ferritins have been shown to be mainly homopolymers of H-type chains, the subunit associated with a ferroxidase activity. Several structures of ferritin have been re®ned to a resoÊ lution of 2.0 A or better: recombinant bullfrog L-chain ferritin (rBfLF; Trikha et al., 1995; PDB code 1rcd), recombinant horse L-chain ferritin (rHoLF; Gallois et al., 1997; PDB code 1dat; Hempstead et al., 1997; PDB code 1aew), variant human H-chain ferritin (rHuHF; Hempstead et al., 1997; PDB code Ê 2fha), the best resolution (1.85 A) being reached for the variant bullfrog H-chain ferritin (rBfHF; Takagi et al., 1998; PDB code 1bg7). In the course of our structural investigation on recombinant mouse L-chain ferritin (rMoLF; Granier et al., 2000), we obtained three crystal forms obtained from different crystallization conditions: a ®rst set of crystals (tetragonal and monoclinic forms) was obtained from solutions which did not contain any metal-ion salt and diffracted to a resolution of

Ê 2.46 A. Using cadmium sulfate as the crystallization agent, we obtained crystals of the cubic F432 form isomorphous to rHoLF, variant rHuHF, rBfLF and rBfHF crystals. Cubic Ê crystals of rMoLF diffract to 2.1 A at room temperature. Under cryogenic conditions and using Cu K X-ray radiation generated by a rotating anode, we collected data to a resoluÊ tion of 1.6 A. Among the reasons which led us to investigate the structure of rMoLF, one of them concerns the speci®c mouse L-chain sequence: it exhibits, along with rat L-chain ferritin sequence, an eight-amino-acid insertion PAQTGAPQ in the exposed loop connecting helices d and e. In a previous study of recombinant rat L-chain ferritin crystals (Lawson, 1990), this insertion was found to be highly disordered. We present here the structure of the cubic form of rMoLF re®ned Ê to a resolution of 1.6 A. We brie¯y compare it with the roomÊ temperature structure re®ned to 2.1 A resolution: in both cases, the de loop insertion is highly disordered. Nevertheless, the low-temperature structure allowed us to improve the model: a few more partially occupied cadmium-binding sites and their coordination shell pattern were determined, several additional side chains were positioned and the ordered water shell was notably built up. Differences from rHoLF and rBfLF are also brie¯y described.

mixing 3 ml of protein solution at a concentration of 3.5 mg mlÀ1 in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 3 ml of precipitant solution composed of 0.92 M ammonium sulfate, 0.4% CdSO4 and 3 mM NaN3. Drops were equilibrated against 1 ml of the same precipitant solution. Crystals had approximate dimensions of 0.5 Â 0.5 Â 0.15 mm. X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted using an X-ray source (graphite monoÊ chromated Cu K, ! = 1.5418 A) provided by an Enraf± Nonius FR571 rotating-anode generator operating at 40 kV and 50 mA. Diffraction data were collected on a 300 mm MAR Research image-plate scanner, processed with the program MOSFLM (Leslie et al., 1986) and further scaled with the program SCALA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The data statistics are gathered in Table 1. Low-temperature data were obtained by the ¯ash-freezing technique. 30% glycerol was added to the mother liquor. Low temperature (100 K) was obtained by cold nitrogen-gas ¯ow using the Cryostream cooler (Oxford Cryosystems, England). Crystals were mounted on a modi®ed Huber goniometer head equipped with a removable arc (Litt et al., 1998).

2. Crystallization and data collection
Expression and puri®cation have been described previously (Santambrogio et al., 2000). An Ala residue replaces the reported Thr at position 121 (Beaumont et al., 1989), a substitution arising from a G3A transition possibly caused by a PCR error. The substitution did not affect protein assembly, stability or ferritin iron-uptake functionality (not shown). The subunit molecular weight is 20 641 Da (182 amino acids). Crystallization was performed using the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion method in Linbro plates. The best crystals were obtained in a few days at 293 K in hanging drops produced by

3. Refinement
The room-temperature and low-temperature structures were re®ned using the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). The starting model was that of rHoLF (Gallois et al., 1997; atomic coordinates from PDB ®le 1dat). Models were visualized and modi®ed based on 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electrondensity maps using the graphics programs TURBO-FRODO (Roussel et al., 1990) and XtalView (McRee, 1993). Water molecules were positioned in well de®ned Fo À Fc residual

2Fo ± Fc maps contoured at 1' have continuous electron density along the subunit backbone, with the exception of the ®rst N-terminus residue, Thr1, the 156±167 segment which corresponds to the de loop insertion and the two last C-terminal residues, i.e. His181 and Asp182. Of the remaining residues, several side chains could not be positioned, i.e. those of Glu11, Arg18, Arg25, Glu45, Glu53, Glu56, Lys91 and Arg120 for the room-temperature structure, and Arg25 and Lys91 for the low-temperature structure. Using the program SFCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999), the lowest density correlation coef®cients (Dcorr = 0.85±0.88) are obtained for the side chains of residues Asp38, Glu60, Glu67 and Gln79 for the room-temperature structure, and the side-chain atoms of residue Glu53 for the low-temperature structure. A Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963) shows that more than 95% of residues are positioned in the most favourable regions. All the residue side chains adopt standard conformations with the exception of two, Asp40 and Tyr28, the side chains of which adopt energetically slightly unfavourable 11± 12 torsion angles: the ®rst residue, although being largely exposed to solvent, is involved in some electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interactions with water molecules, whereas for the second residue the unfavourable 11±12 values arise from strong hydrophobic interactions and steric hindrance by neighbouring residues of the same subunit as well as by residues of the neighbouring subunit related by the twofoldsymmetry molecular axis.

The ad -helix bundle is de®ned by the segments Thr10± Phe37, Glu45±Arg72, Thr92±Ala119 and Pro123±Val154, whereas segment Leu169±Leu177 de®nes the ®fth e helix located at the C-terminal extremity (Fig. 1a). Helices b and c are connected by a long loop Gly74±Gly90. Helix d has the characteristic bending at position His132 as found in rHoLF or rBfLF. The non-helical regions are characterized by the following. (i) At the N-terminal end, two consecutive -turns, i.e. residues Ser2±Arg5 (type I) and residues Arg5±Tyr8 (type IV). (ii) Two successive type I (residues Arg39±Val42) and type IV (residues Asp40±Ala43) -turns at the ab loop and a long twisted bc loop (residues Gly74±Gly90) which ends with a type VIII -turn (residues Gln86±Trp89). The main-chain orientation of residue Val81 allows its NH and CO groups to build a short antiparallel pleated sheet with the same residue of the neighbouring subunit related by a twofold axis.

ture allowed the positioning of six more side chains, 135 more water molecules and ®ve more cadmium partial binding sites (see Table 2). The latter were determined, as mentioned above, with anomalous Fourier difference maps calculated Ê with data in the range 8±2.0 A.
3.4. Comparison with rHoLF and rBfLF

This structure exhibits a few differences from those of 1dat and 1rcd, as revealed by the C superposition of rHoLF and rBfLF onto those of rMoLF: r.m.s. deviations are 0.23 and Ê 0.36 A, respectively. For rHoLF, the most important differences occur in the bc loop and the poorly de®ned extremities of the de insertion loop of the rMoLF sequence. The deviations in the bc loop superposition is explained by the presence of a valine in position 81 instead of a leucine in rHoLF. The side-chain atoms of residue Val81 are embedded between the main chain of the bc loop and helix a and the bulkiness of Leu81 in rHoLF is responsible for the shift of residues 79±84 (Fig. 1b). For rBfLF, the greatest deviation occurs at the %-bulge position 132 in helix d, where a proline substitutes for a histidine in the bullfrog L-chain sequence. Differences in the backbone appear also at the end of the bc loop, where a type IV -turn (Arg86±Trp89) is followed by a -turn (Tyr89±Asn91) (Fig. 1c) in the rBfLF structure.

Figure 1

Polar and electrostatic interactions are listed in Table 3 and are compared with those of rHoLF, to which they are very similar (70% interactions conserved). A major difference with this latter concerns the salt bridge embedded within the fourhelix bundle: this salt bridge is a common feature of L-chain ferritins and substitutes the ferroxidase centre observed in H-chain ferritins. In the present structure, several differences from the horse L-chain sequence, i.e. Leu102Met, Phe133Tyr, Glu136Lys and particularly Tyr23His substitutions, noticeably modify the environment of the conserved Lys58± Glu103 electrostatic interaction: the Tyr23His substitution leads to the presence of a water molecule which binds His23 N4 and occupies the space held by Tyr23 OH in rHoLF: Fig. 2 depicts the penetration of water molecules inside the four-helix bundle. In rBfLF, an electrostatic interaction is observed between Lys23 and Glu58. These three examples show that a strong variability is allowed for this salt bridge, which has been mentioned as playing an important role in the thermal stability of L-chain ferritins (Hempstead et al., 1997; Martsev et al., 1998).

bouring subunits. Interactions with solvent water molecules are depicted in more detail in the present structure, where 286 water molecules have been located, of which 192 belong to the ®rst shell. Among these latter water molecules, 47 connect neighbouring subunits and are shown in Fig. 3 along with the intersubunit electrostatic and polar interactions. Fig. 3 underlines the small number of non-water interactions present in the vicinity of the threefold axes, the entry route of iron ions into the ferritin shell.
3.7. Hydrophobic interactions upon shell assembly

The ferritin subunit exhibits on its external surface noticeable hydrophobic regions which are buried upon assembly of the protein shell. Two of these regions were previously depicted in the structures of rHoLF (Ford et al., 1984) and of rHuHF (Lawson et al., 1991; Hempstead et al., 1997). An

Figure 2

attempt to describe these hydrophobic surfaces is carried out using the software QUILT (Lijnzaad et al., 1996; Lijnzaad & Argos, 1997). The surface values of the six largest hydrophobic patches are listed in Table 4, along with those of their fractions which remain exposed to the solvent after the shell assembly. Ê Patches 1 and 2 display large values (about 600 A2 each) and correspond to the interface regions generated by the twofold and fourfold symmetry axes: they are 80% buried when the protein shell is assembled. Less extended patches 3 and 4 are also 50 and 80% buried upon shell assembly. Fig. 4 shows the various proportions of accessible areas of one subunit, as well as their fractions buried upon shell assembly. It allows us to note the following. When subunits assemble, the proportion of buried hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas remains constant at about 60 and 40%, respectively. However, the contribution of the four largest hydrophobic patches to the buried hydrophobic area is predominant: whilst they represent 31% of the accessible hydrophobic area (Fig. 4, column 1), their buried fraction upon shell assembly represents 56% of the hydrophobic buried area (Fig. 4, column 2). On the other hand, small hydrophobic patches, the areas of Ê which are less than $200 A2, do not seem to contribute to shell assembly: the ®rst water shell shields most of these patches as well as polar residues (Fig. 4, column 3). For example, patch number 6, listed in Table 4, is almost masked by ordered water molecules which bind neighbouring polar residues. Therefore, the four largest hydrophobic patches listed in Table 4 de®nitely play an active role during shell assembly of the ferritin molecule.

Cadmium-binding sites were determined from anomalous Fourier difference maps. Residues involved in cadmium-binding sites are listed in Table 5. They are identical to those previously found in rHoLF (Granier et al., 1998 and references therein): Asp80 and Gln82 for intermolecular contacts; Glu53, Glu56, Glu57 and Glu60 for the ferrihydrite nucleation centre; and His114, Glu130, Asp127 and His132 for the threefold-axis entry route of iron ions. Only one exception, an additional site, is found at His49, close to the nucleation centre. Ê Average distances are 2.19 and 2.27 A for  CdÐO and CdÐN (histidine) bonds, respectively. As regards the coordination of the various sites, only those of Asp80, Gln82 (square planar) and His132 (octahedral) are well de®ned, whereas those located on the threefold axis (His114, Glu130 and Asp127)

the recombinant rat L-chain ferritin (Lawson, 1990). The major difference from rHoLF and rBfLF concerns the salt bridge embedded within the fourRemaining helix bundle of the subunit. In rMoLF, accessible area After shell per subunit assembly the presence of a histidine in position 23 after shell including instead of a tyrosine or a lysine is assembly solvent compensated by the penetration of 100 51 water molecules into the helix bundle. The hydrogen bonds and salt bridges 116 59 are highly conserved: 24 of them participate in the shell assembly along with 47 water molecules. All interface 119 2 regions are involved with the exception of the vicinity of the threefold-axis 44 0 interface (the iron-entry route). 175 45 The metal-binding sites are identical to those observed in rHoLF, with the 176 7 exception of a new site involving a histidine in position 49. This residue is 730 164 highly conserved in mammalian L-chain ferritins and could be considered as part of the ferrihydrite nucleation centre. Six large hydrophobic patches located at the subunit external surface have been described using the procedures of from Lijnzaad et al. (1996). Four of them seem to actively participate in the assembly process of the ferritin subunits into the protein shell. The two largest patches correspond to interface

as well as those at the nucleation site (His49, Glu53, Glu56, Glu57, Glu60) are incompletely determined owing to threefold symmetry disorder, statistical disorder or incomplete determination of coordinated water molecules.

4. Conclusions
Ê The structure of rMoLF has been determined at 1.6 A resolution under cryogenic conditions. The protomer shows little differences from two other L-chain ferritin structures, i.e. those of horse and bullfrog. The structure of the eight-aminoacid insertion PAQTGAPQ, located in the de loop could not be determined at either room temperature or at low temperature. This part of the structure is strongly disordered as previously observed in the room-temperature structure of
