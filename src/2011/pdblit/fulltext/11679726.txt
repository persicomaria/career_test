The effect of stabilizing additives on the structure and hydration of proteins: a study involving tetragonal lysozyme
In order to elucidate the effect of stabilizing additives on the structure of proteins and the associated ordered water molecules in the hydration shell, the crystal structures of tetragonal lysozyme grown in the presence of sucrose, sorbitol and trehalose have been re®ned. Also re®ned are the structures of orthorhombic and monoclinic lysozyme grown under the conditions in which tetragonal lysozyme is normally grown. A comparison of the two sets of structures with the structure of native tetragonal lysozyme shows that the effect of the additives on the structure of the protein molecule is less than that of the normal minor changes associated with differences in molecular packing. Surprisingly, the same is true of the effect on the hydration shell, represented by the ordered water molecules attached to the protein. Thus, it appears that the cause of the stabilizing effect of the additives needs to be sought outside the immediate neighbourhood of the protein molecule. Sorbitol and trehalose do not coherently interact with the protein. One sucrose molecule binds at the active-site cleft of the enzyme

1. Introduction
Sugars and polyols are often used to enhance the stability of proteins (Back et al., 1979; Timasheff, 1993; Wimmer et al., 1997). In addition to its fundamental importance, the stabilization process has received considerable attention in recent years on account of its practical utility in terms of preservation, particularly in relation to the food industry (Rajeshwara & Prakash, 1996). A number of studies on the mechanism underlying enhanced protein stability in the presence of these additives have been reported in recent years (Timasheff, 1993; Lin & Timasheff, 1996; Priev et al., 1996; Xie & Timasheff, 1997; Sola-Penna & Meyer-Fernandes, 1998). These investigations, mainly based on physicochemical and thermodynamic techniques, indicated that the stabilizing effect of these compounds is achieved by modulation of the solvent structure around the protein molecule. It is generally believed that the stabilization of the protein conformation is achieved not by the speci®c binding of the additives, but by their preferential exclusion from the protein surface and the consequent preferential hydration of the protein. To date, no systematic crystallographic study appears to have been carried out to explore at near-atomic resolution the effect of these additives on protein structure and hydration. Such a study would also reveal the direct interactions, if any, of the stabilizing compounds with the protein and the water around it. Hen egg-white lysozyme is a good model system for such a study, as its structure in many crystal forms is well characterized and also as a number of investigations have

packing are higher than those caused by additives. In both cases, loops known to be ¯exible (Biswal et al., 2000) show larger deviations. The observed pattern of deviations therefore represent the known differential ¯exibility of different regions of the enzyme molecule and not any speci®c effect of additives. It has been shown earlier that 45 of the 103 non-Gly, non-Ala, non-Pro residues in lysozyme have totally conserved side-chain conformations in 20 crystallographically independent enzyme molecules (Biswal et al., 2000). The same conformations are retained in the seven independent molecules in the present study. Of 309 relevant residues in the three structures grown in the presence of additives, only 21 have conformations signi®cantly different (Biswal et al., 2000) from that in the native tetragonal crystals, compared with 28 in the three molecules in the orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals, indicating again the higher effect of differences in packing than of additives. In both cases, a majority of the residues with changed conformation are arginine and lysine which have long and ¯exible side chains. Internal hydrogen bonds provide another indication of structural conservation. The hydrogen bonds described as invariant by Biswal et al. (2000) exist in all seven molecules. The re®ned structure of the native tetragonal crystal in the present study contains 228 main-chain±main-chain, 70 mainchain±side-chain and 15 side-chain±side-chain hydrogen bonds. Of these, those retained in the structures containing sucrose, sorbitol and trehalose are 225, 57 and 8; 222, 62 and 12; and 222, 62 and 14, respectively. The corresponding numbers in the orthorhombic crystals and molecules A and B of the monoclinic crystals are 219, 49 and 9; 222, 51 and 10; and 223, 47 and 10, respectively. These numbers indicate that main-chain±main-chain hydrogen bonds are largely unaffected by the additives as well as changes in the crystal packing. The effect of additives on hydrogen bonds involving side chains is, however, lower than that caused by packing. Some hydrogen bonds are disrupted by the binding of a sucrose molecule to the enzyme.

Thermodynamic studies on the effect of cosolvents and additives on proteins have stressed the reorganization of water molecules around protein molecules. The high-resolution X-ray results reported here enable one to explore the reorganization, if any, of ordered water molecules in the presence of additives in comparison to that normally caused by changes in crystal packing. As indicated in Table 2, the number of water molecules identi®ed for each protein molecule has comparable values in different structures. Assuming the speci®c gravity of water in the crystals to be 1, a roughand-ready estimate indicates that they represent about a half (monoclinic form) to a third (orthorhombic form) of the water molecules present in the crystals. A more important parameter is the number of molecules in the hydration shell of each protein molecule. As in the previous studies in this laboratory, the primary hydration shell of a protein molecule is considActa Cryst. (2001). D57, 1614±1620

ered to be made up of ordered water molecules at a distance of Ê 3.6 A or less from a protein O or N atom. The numbers of water molecules in the hydration shells are 114, 131 and 127 in the crystals grown in the presence of sucrose, sorbitol and trehalose, respectively. The corresponding numbers in the native tetragonal, the orthorhombic and molecules A and B of the monoclinic crystals are 127, 127, 138 and 143, respectively. All the tetragonal crystals, except that containing a bound sucrose molecule, have very similar numbers of water molecules in the hydration shell. Therefore, there is no evidence for preferential hydration in the presence of additives, at least as far as the ordered bound water molecules are concerned. In addition to the number of protein-bound water molecules, their organization is also of crucial importance in the present study. As in our previous studies, a water molecule in one form and that in another form may be considered as equivalent if they interact with at least one common protein Ê atom and if the distance between them is less than 1.8 A when the two protein molecules along with their hydration shells are superposed. The positions of water molecules associated with proteins are highly variable and only a few ordered water molecules remain invariant with respect to their locations across crystal forms (Biswal et al., 2000). Therefore, one can, in general, discuss variations only in terms of average effects. In this context, the number of equivalent water molecules in pairs of crystallographically independent molecules, listed in Table 4, is a good parameter. The numbers of equivalent water molecules are clearly very high among the tetragonal crystals irrespective of the presence of the additives. They are substantially higher than those among molecules in different packing environments but with the same solution around the molecules. The binding-site groove is a heavily hydrated region of the molecule (Madhusudan et al., 1993). Water molecules are necessary not only as catalytic equipment (Rupley et al., 1983; Rupley & Careri, 1991), but also to maintain the active-site geometry (Nagendra et al., 1998). The number of water molecules in the binding groove of lysozyme varies between 20 and 28. 14 of them remain invariant among the tetragonal

These plots in the earlier study of 20 independent lysozyme molecules were prepared using GNUPLOT (Williams & Kelley, 1999) (Biswal et al., 2000). The number of buried water molecules is a measure of the cavities within the protein molecule. The seven lysozyme molecules have four buried water molecules located at identical positions. They include the one identi®ed as buried in all lysozyme structures (Biswal et al., 2000). All of the seven water molecules identi®ed as invariant are also present in the seven structures.

4. Conclusions
The results presented here conclusively demonstrate that the structure of the lysozyme molecule remains unaffected by the presence of the sugars sucrose and trehalose and the polyol sorbitol in the surrounding medium. The additives do not even affect the level of hydration as indicated by the numbers of ordered water molecules associated to the protein. Still more surprisingly, they do not cause any signi®cant reorganization of water molecules in the hydration shell. In fact, the changes in the hydration shell caused by the additives are smaller than those normally caused by differences in packing arrangement. Among the three additives, only one interacts with the protein in a coherent manner. A sucrose molecule binds at the binding groove of the enzyme molecule. We thank Dr N.

3.3. Interaction of sucrose with lysozyme

One sucrose molecule is bound to the active site of the enzyme molecule in the crystal grown in the presence of the sugar (Fig. 2). Sucrose, Glc1-2Fru, is a disaccharide made up of glucose and fructose. The interactions of the sugar molecule with the protein are illustrated in Fig. 3. The glucose moiety occupies subsites C and D, while fructose interacts exclusively with subsite C. The crystal structures of several carbohydrate complexes of lysozyme are available. The  (Blake et al., 1967) and the  (Beddell et al., 1970) forms of GlcNAc bind at the C subsite. The disaccharide GlcNAc1-4Glc, like sucrose, occupies the C and D subsites (Beddell et al., 1970). However di-NAG occupies subsites B and C (Kurachi et al., 1976). The trisaccharides tri-NAG (Cheetham et al., 1992) and NAMNAG-NAM (Kelly et al., 1979) occupy subsites ABC and BCD, respectively. There have been studies on the binding of small molecules to lysozyme, notably those involving ethanol (Lehmann et al., 1985) and DMSO (Lehmann & Stan®eld, 1989). In both cases, the binding appeared to be non-speci®c. Several lysozyme structures solved using data collected at very low temperatures are available (PDB codes 1a2y, 1at6, 1bhz, 1lz8, 1lz9, 3lyt, 3lzt and 5lyt). They involved the use of cryoprotectants, but in no case were the cryoprotectant molecules located in the lattice. A superposition of the sucrose bound molecule on the molecule in the native tetragonal structure and search in Ê Ê locations within 2.7 A from sugar O atoms and 2.8 A from sugar C atoms indicated that the sucrose molecule replaces eight bound water molecules. That is the reason for the smaller number of water molecules in the hydration shell in the crystals grown in the presence of sucrose than in those in other crystals. It also turns out that two of the displaced water molecules have positions close to those of glucose O1 and O6. Like the sugar O atoms, these water molecules interact with Ala107 O and Asn59 N. Such mimicry of sugar hydroxyl groups by water molecules has been widely observed (Ravishankar et al., 1999; Elgavish & Shannan, 1998; Delbaere et al., 1990, 1993).
