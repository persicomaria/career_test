As part of a program aimed at the development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative 27 was discovered by high throughput screening. Successive replacements of the p-F substituent of 27 by an aminoethoxy side chain and of the 1-H of the tetrahydroisoquinoline core by a 1-Me group provided analogues 19 and 20. These compounds showed potencies in a cell-based reporter gene assay (ERE assay) varying between 0.6 and 20 nM and displayed antagonist behaviors in the MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line with IC50s in the range of 2-36 nM. The effect of N-phenyl substituents on the activity and pharmacokinetic properties of tetrahydroisoquinoline analogues was explored. As a result of this investigation, two potent derivatives bearing a p-F N-aryl group, 19c and 20c, were discovered as candidates suitable for further profiling. To gain insight into the ligand-receptor interaction, the X-ray crystallographic structure of the 1-H tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative (R)-18a in complex with ERR-ligand binding domain (LBD)301-553/CfS triple mutant was solved to 2.28 Å. An overlay of this X-ray crystal structure with that reported for the complex of ERRLBD301-553/carboxymethylated C and raloxifene (5) shows that both compounds bind to the same cleft of the receptor and display comparable binding modes, with differences being observed in the conformation of their "D-ring" phenyl groups.
Introduction Estrogens such as 17 -estradiol (1) and estrone (2) (Figure 1) are steroid hormones long recognized as key mediators of female reproductive functions. However, they also exert their actions on other systems. For instance, estrogens contribute to the maintenance of bone tissue by determining the rate at which bone is renewed through a process involving bone resorption and bone formation.1 They influence bone remodeling by suppressing, either directly or indirectly, the production of a number of cytokines which regulate the formation of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption.2 Most endogenous estrogens bind with high affinity to the two currently known estrogen receptors, ERR and ER .3 The two receptors, which act as ligandactivated transcription factors, are found in a wide variety of tissues and show a distinct but also overlapping distribution pattern.3,4 X-ray crystal structures of receptor-ligand complexes have shown that the binding pockets of ERR and ER differ by only two amino acids (Leu and Met in ERR are replaced by Met and Ile in ER ),5 a feature which explains the lack of selectivity of 17 -estradiol (1) in binding the estrogen receptors. Current evidence point toward ERR as occupying an important role in bone remodeling,6 but ER may also be a contributor to this process.6 It is not yet clear what effect an ER subtype-selective ligand would trigger on bone tissue.

It is apparent, however, that the decline in ovarian estrogen production which accompanies menopause causes an elevation in osteoclast number leading to an increase in bone remodeling.7 Since there is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation processes in favor of the former, the increase in bone turnover results in accelerated bone loss. This phenomenon gives rise to progressive thinning of cancellous and cortical bone structures and to a decrease of the me-

chanical properties of the bone and its resistance to fractures.7,8 In addition to affecting bone metabolism, the reduction of endogenous estrogens levels caused by ovarian failure has been linked to the transient appearance of vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats and to changes in hepatic lipid metabolism.8 Hormone replacement therapies (estrogens alone or estrogens coadministered with progestins to oppose the stimulating action of estrogens on uterine tissue) have been used for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms related to the menopause and for prevention of osteoporosis.7,8 Additionally, these therapeutic regimens have been prescribed for the prevention of heart diseases since observational studies suggested that estrogens lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.7,8b However, the recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study comparing oral administration of combined estrogens/progestin with placebo showed that women using the combination therapy experience increased risks of coronary heart disease and breast cancer.9 On the other hand, positive effects on fracture rates and reductions of colorectal cancer were reported.9 These results highlight the need to further develop surrogates able to effect bone protection in an estrogenlike manner without demonstrating its adverse side effects on breast, uterine tissues, and the cardiovascular system. Compounds which display such a tissue-selective behavior, mimicking estrogen in some tissues while antagonizing its action in others are named SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators)10 (Figure 1). A number of SERMs are currently in clinical trials and two compounds of this class, tamoxifen (3, its most active metabolite being 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4)) and raloxifene (5), are currently on the market for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer10c,d and prevention and treatment of osteoporosis,11 respectively. These two products have distinct pharmacological profiles. Both compounds demonstrate bone-protective effects in humans, but tamoxifen (3) has been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer,10,12 while raloxifene (5) does not appear to be associated with uterine side effects.11 Both tamoxifen (3) and raloxifene (5) have been linked to an increased risk of thromboembolism and to an exacerbation of hot flushes in a number of patients. In addition, the latter substance suffers from a low oral bioavailability in humans (2%).11 The distinctive pharmacological behaviors of tamoxifen (3) and raloxifene (5) were postulated to be linked, in part, to the spatial orientation of their respective 2-aminoethoxyphenyl moiety relative to the plane of their central core. The phenyl group bearing the 2-aminoethoxy side chain in tamoxifen (3) is coplanar in relation to its stilbene skeleton, while that of raloxifene (5) is oriented orthogonally to the plane of its benzothiophene nucleus, an orientation rendered possible by the presence of the carbonyl functionality.13 In addition, the low bioavailability of raloxifene (5), which results from extensive phenolic glucuronidation in animals and in postmenopausal women, was hypothesized to stem from the planarity of its phenol-containing nucleus acting as a substrate for glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).14 On the other hand, a compound such as lasofoxifene (6) embedding a less planar phenol

showed an improved bioavailability profile in rats and in monkeys (60% and 45%, respectively) compared with that displayed by raloxifene (5) in the same species (10 and 5%, respectively).14 In light of the subtle structural features that greatly influence SERMs' activity (on breast, uterine, bone tissues, and lipid metabolism) and bioavailability, we initiated a program aiming to identify new compounds of this class with improved pharmacological properties. We wish to disclose here the results of our initial efforts in the investigation of ERR-selective ligands of the tetrahydroisoquinoline series leading to the discovery of analogues which display excellent in vitro properties and have good bioavailabilities in rats. Chemistry The tetrahydroisoquinolines were initially prepared via a route involving a Bischler-Napieralski cyclization reaction as outlined in Scheme 1.15 3-Benzyloxyphenylacetyl chloride (9), prepared in two steps from 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, was transformed into the amide 10 by treatment with aniline. LAH-mediated reduction of 10 led to the aniline derivative 11 which, upon reaction with 4-allyloxybenzoyl chloride (8), furnished amide 12. This latter compound was transformed into an intermediate iminium ion by the action of POCl3 at reflux temperature. Conversion of this iminium ion into compounds 13 and 14 was achieved by reduction with NaBH4 to produce the former or via reaction with MeMgBr in Et2O to generate the latter.16 Pd(OAc)2catalyzed removal of the allyloxy protecting group provided phenols 15 and 16 which underwent alkylation upon treatment with NaH and 1-(2-chloroethyl)pyrrolidine or 1-(2-chloroethyl)piperidine in dioxane. Deprotection yielded the final products 17a-20a. Aiming to shorten and improve the preparation of our final target molecules, we devised a second synthetic approach to products 19a-j, 20a-j, and 26a as depicted in Scheme 2. In the first step of our new sequence, we made use of the Schmidt rearrangement of 5-methoxyindanone (21) to quickly and conveniently access large quantities of the bicyclic lactam 22.17 The isoquinolin1-one 22 proved to be a versatile intermediate of our synthetic scheme. It was cleanly and efficiently Narylated under Ullmann-type conditions, using CuI in DMF.18 Compounds 23a-j were then converted into the tetrahydroisoquinolines 24a-j in two steps. Treatment of 23a-j with benzyloxyphenyllithium provided, after acidic workup with HClO4, intermediate iminium salts which were subsequently treated with MeMgBr in THF to furnish the desired 1-methyl-tetrahydroisoquinolines 24a-j.16 AlCl3-mediated debenzylation19 was carried out in the presence of Me2NPh in CH2Cl2 to yield phenols 25a-j. Alkylation of 25a-j followed by cleavage of the methyl ether in the presence of AlCl3 and EtSH provided tetrahydroisoquinolines 19a-j, 20a-j, and 26a in a short sequence of steps. Biology As part of our initial screening strategy, our compounds were tested in three in vitro assays. Binding to the estrogen receptor is a prerequisite in the search for compounds able to modulate estrogen signaling with SERM-like characteristics. Thus, in a first instance, the

affinity/selectivity of the tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives for ERR and ER was evaluated in a [3H]-estradiol radioligand binding assay using recombinant human ERR and ER . Potencies and selectivities were further assessed in a cellular transcription assay using HeLa cells stably transfected with human ERR and ER and an estrogen response element (ERE) upstream of a luciferase gene. In view of the fact that hormones are key players in the regulation of target cell proliferation and protein syntheses and that estrogen administration

has been linked to adverse effects due to its proliferative action on some tissues, the third in vitro assay was used as an indicator of the ligand's behavior on tissues/cells affected by estrogen. For this purpose, new molecules were evaluated for their ability to antagonize 17 estradiol (1)'s proliferative action on MCF-7 breast tumor cells. The agonist action of the SERMs was also measured in this cellular assay in the absence of estrogen. Finally, to get early insight into the pharmacokinetic properties of interesting compounds, selected candidates were profiled in rats using cassette dosing experiments. Results and Discussion High throughput screening of our sample collection using a binding assay led to the identification of tetrahydroisoquinoline 27 (Figure 2), a substance which had been reported as an antiimplantation agent.15 Not unexpectedly, compound 27 lacked antagonist activity in the MCF-7 cellular assay despite its affinity for ERR (IC50 ) 285 nM, Table 1).

correctly positioned aminoethoxy side chain to confer SERMs their antagonist properties has precedents in the literature. With this concept in mind, derivatives 17a and 18a were synthesized.20 Not only did both compounds show a much improved potency in the MCF-7 assay, displaying IC50s in the order of 29 and 32 nM, respectively, but their affinity to ERR in the binding assay was also increased (IC50s ) 21 and 19 nM, for compounds 17a and 18a, respectively, Table 1, entries 2 and 3). To assess at an early stage of the program whether our leads were bioavailable, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 17a and 18a were evaluated in a cassette dosing experiment carried out in rats. The

pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives showed 73 and 42% oral bioavailabilities, respectively (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). These encouraging in vitro results and pharmacokinetic properties convinced us to further optimize potency. Since the binding pocket of ER is rather hydrophobic, we reasoned that we might be able to achieve our objective by increasing the lipophilicity of the tetrahydroisoquinoline core. With this aim in mind, we envisaged to introduce an alkyl substituent at the 1-position of the tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleus. We hypothesized that the binding pocket of ER might accommodate the presence of a methyl group at that position. To the best of our knowledge, SERMs possess-

ing cyclic frameworks incorporating an aminoethoxyphenyl and an alkyl substituent at the 1-position have not been reported in the literature. However, there is a literature precedent showing that the presence of an additional methyl group at the 2-position is not prohibitive for binding to ERR. The tetrahydronaphthalene derivative ZM 189,154 (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl-1-[9(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentane-1-sulfinyl)nonyl]-1,2,3,4tetrahydronaphth-6-ol),21 embedding a 4-hydroxyphenyl and a methyl group at the 2-position, was described as a pure antiestrogen having high affinity for ERR. To verify our assumption, we synthesized the tetrahydroisoquinoline 20a and profiled it in our in vitro assays. This derivative was found to display good binding affinity for ERR and ER , confirming that the presence of a 1-Me group was tolerated. However, the binding affinity of 20a relative to 18a was not improved but, interestingly, the former compound displayed 8and 6-fold increase in activity over the latter in the MCF-7 and transcriptional activation through ERE cellular assays, showing IC50s comparable to those of raloxifene (5) and lasofoxifene (6) (Table 1, entries 23 and 24). Others have also experienced a similar phenomenon whereby compounds showing comparable potencies in the binding assay were differenciated in the MCF-7 assay.22 The observed disparity of the results could stem from differences in the physicochemical properties of the substances tested, differences which would in turn affect cell permeability, intracellular compound concentration and thus potency. From a mechanistic point of view, another plausible rationale relates to the likelihood that subtle conformational differences of the ligand-receptor complexes might influence the nature of the interactions with the transcriptional machinery and thus the read-out of the cellular assays. For example, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4) but not raloxifene (5) has been shown to recruit steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) to ERR in endometrial cells,23 although both compounds have similar affinities to ERR (Table 1). The results of the cellular assays were thus believed to be more relevant to the physiological situation and were later used as main indicators of potency. We then endeavored to expand the series and explore the effects of N-aryl substituents on the activity, selectivity, and particularly on the pharmacokinetic behavior of the resulting analogues. Compounds bearing paraand meta-substituents were prepared following the routes outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. As may be inferred from the data listed in Table 1, a number of potent compounds with IC50s ranging between 0.6 and 19.8 nM and 2.0-36 nM for the ERE and MCF-7 assays were synthesized, indicating that various substituents were tolerated. These results are in accordance with data reported previously for raloxifene analogues where the influence of different "D-ring" substituents on activity was studied.22b The presence of a m-OH functionality led to a slight increase of potency in the cell assays (Table 1, entries 15 and 16), while the addition of a m-iPr or a m-NMe2 group decreased activity in the three in vitro tests (Table 1, entries 20-22). Noticeably high selectivity for ERR over ER in both the binding and in the ERE assays was observed for analogues bearing a p-iPr group. Tetrahydroisoquinolines 19e and 20e which

embed this substitution pattern show specificities of up to 50-fold for ERR over ER (as measured in the in vitro radioligand binding assay) (Table 1, entries 13, 14). In view of the fact that tamoxifen (3) and its most active metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4) display a dual antagonist/agonist behavior in the MCF-7 cell assay,24 the potential of the tetrahydroisoquinolines to favor tumor cell proliferation (agonistic behavior) in the absence of 17 -estradiol (1) was also evaluated. The tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives 19a-g and 20a-f exhibited an agonist activity weaker than that displayed by their desmethyl analogues, 17a and 18a, raloxifene (5), lasofoxifene (6), and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4) (Table 1). Taken together, the results of the MCF-7 assay show that a number of tetrahydroisoquinoline analogues are potent estrogen antagonists in this assay and only display weak agonism in the absence of estrogen. These data indicate that such compounds may have a potential for breast cancer prevention/treatment in vivo, a feature which is relevant when considering substituting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by a SERM treatment. Pharmacokinetic Properties. Having in hand SERMs with the desired functional activity, we selected candidates for further profiling in a PK cassette dosing experiment in rats. The pharmacokinetic parameters for designated analogues in comparison with the two reference compounds 5 and 6 are disclosed in Table 2. The tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative 20a displayed a modest 23% absolute oral bioavailability (BAV) and a low peak plasma level (Cmax of 5.2 nM, po, dose-normalized) in contrast to its desmethyl analogue 18a which reached 42% bioavailability and a Cmax value of 31 nM p.o. dosenormalized. The data obtained for the m-OH analogue 19f paralleled those observed for 20a. A major improvement was achieved with the two derivatives bearing a p-F on the N-phenyl ring. The absolute oral bioavailabilities for the pyrrolidine and piperidine analogues 19c and 20c were 53 and 56%, and peak plasma levels reached values of 20 and 16 nM, respectively. This increase in bioavailability may result from blockage of oxidative metabolism of the N-phenyl at the paraposition, indicating that oxidation of 20a may be the predominant pathway for metabolism over direct glucuronidation. The values found for 19c and 20c compare favorably with those obtained for lasofoxifene (6, Table 2, entry 8, BAV: 38%; Cmax: 15.5 nM) and were higher than those exhibited by raloxifene (5, Table 2, entry 7; BAV: 22%; Cmax: 7.5 nM). X-ray Crystal Structure. To gain insight into the ligand-receptor interaction, we aimed to obtain the X-ray crystal structure of a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative in complex with ERR- ligand binding domain (LBD). The preparation of the complex of ERR-LBD with a racemic mixture of 18a was initially performed following published procedures.25,26 The ERR-LBD (residues 301-553) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified by ligand-affinity chromatography and carboxymethylated. However, no suitable crystals of the resulting complex could be obtained. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed heterogeneous carboxymethylation of the cysteines. To overcome this problem, three solvent accessible cysteines (C381, C417, C530) were mutated to serines.27 The complex of ERR-LBD mutant with 18a

was readily purified to homogeneity by a three-step chromatography, and well-diffracting crystals were obtained. Noteworthy, the yield of the purified ERRLBD mutant complex was 7-fold higher than that obtained with the wild-type protein (18.4 mg and 2.5 mg per liter of culture, respectively). The structure of the complex was solved to 2.28 Å. The final refined model includes residues 307-525 and 535-546 since the electron density for residues 301-306, 526-534, and 547-553 is not well resolved. The electron density of the ligand is well defined and reveals that only one enantiomer, that possessing the R absolute configuration, binds to ERR. The observation that one enantiomer has a significantly higher binding affinity than the other has been reported for SERMs such as lasofoxifene (6),14 NNC 45-0781, a cis-diaryl-hydroxychromane derivative,28a and EM-652.28b In the case of lasofoxifene (6),14 the absolute configuration of the most potent enantiomer was determined to correspond to the 1R,2S isomer as illustrated in Figure 1. Likewise, the pure enantiomer NNC 45-078128a was shown to possess a lasofoxifenelike absolute configuration. In a manner analogous to lasofoxifene (6) and NNC 45-0781, (R)-18a possesses an absolute configuration at C-1 which is estradiol-like. Thus, it appears reasonable that one enantiomer of racemic 18a is more potent than the other and that the most active component of the racemate corresponds to the enantiomer which cocrystallized with the ERR-LBD mutant, that possessing the R absolute configuration. An overlay of the X-ray crystal structures of the complexes of ERR-ligand binding domain (LBD) with (R)-18a and raloxifene (5) shows that both compounds bind to the same cleft of the receptor and display similarities in their binding modes (Figure 3). In both structures, the phenolic hydroxyl interacts with Glu353, Arg394, and a water molecule while the piperidine

nitrogen forms a salt-bridge with Asp351. The basic side chains of (R)-18a and raloxifene (5) adopt similar positions, thus placing the C-terminal helix (H-12, residues 536-544) into what has been described as the "antagonist" position.25 The main difference between the two lies in the conformation of their "D ring" phenyl groups, that of 18a being oriented almost perpendicularly to the plane of its tetrahydroisoquinolinol core while that of raloxifene (5) is tilted by 45° out of planarity relative to its benzothiophene central core. In addition, since raloxifene's phenyl ring bears a 4-OH group, it forms an additional hydrogen bond with His524, an interaction which cannot occur with 18a. Modeling Studies. On the basis of this information, it is possible that the R enantiomer of 20a binds within ERR in an orientation similar to that observed for (R)18a such that the methyl occupies the R-position. We used docking and modeling studies to confirm whether this could be the case. GOLD docking studies were initially performed using both enantiomers of 18a and the X-ray crystal structure of raloxifene (5)25 (See Supporting Information). The predicted binding mode of (R)-18a within the LBD of ERR was in agreement with the X-ray crystal structure of the ERR-LBD301-553/ CfS triple mutant /(R)-18a complex. The same GOLD docking was repeated with each of the enantiomers of 20a. As a result of this study, the R enantiomer of 20a obtained a significantly better GOLD score than its mirror image and was predicted to adopt a binding mode similar to that of 18a. We were therefore confident to use the X-ray crystal structure of the ERR-LBD mutant/ (R)-18a complex to build a refined model of the complex of ERR-LBD mutant with (R)-20a by simply changing the C-1 hydrogen of (R)-18a by a methyl group, followed by a minimization protocol (See Supporting Information). The final model is illustrated in Figure 4. It indeed

For details on the docking and modeling studies, see Supporting Information. Only water WAT103 and amino acids Phe404, Arg394, Glu353, Asp351, Leu525, His524, Ile424, Phe425, Ile428 of ERR-LBD (X-ray structure with (R)-18a) are shown. The solvent accessible surface (in yellow) of the modeled receptor around the C-1 methyl group of 20a is mainly formed by Leu346 which is hidden under the surface. This picture shows that the C-1 methyl group of (R)-20a is nicely accommodated in the model.

suggests that (R)-20a adopts a binding mode analogous to that of (R)-18a. Conclusion We have disclosed herein the outcome of our initial efforts to identify estrogen receptor modulators able to display mixed agonist/antagonist behaviors. More specifically, we have reported the discovery of tetrahydroisoquinolines which bind to the estrogen receptors with high affinity. We have shown that modification of the substitution pattern of the N-phenyl ring has a modest impact on potency in most instances but influences significantly the selectivity in the case of analogues bearing a p-i-Pr group. The pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives 19e and 20e were found to exhibit up to 50fold specificities for ERR over ER . We have shown that addition of an aminoethoxy side chain and replacement of the 1-H in our initial lead 27 by a 1-Me furnished the potent ligand 20a. This compound, along with a number of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives, displayed antagonistic properties in the MCF-7 assay, by inhibiting the proliferative action of 17 -estradiol (1) on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the tetrahydroisoquinolines could be attuned by means of appropriate substituents on the N-phenyl group. On the basis of their in vitro data and their promising pharmacokinetic properties, the p-F deriva-

tives 19c and 20c qualify as the most interesting candidates for further investigations. It remains to be determined whether such substances would have improved profiles in vivo. The quest for the "ideal" SERM will certainly remain a challenge due to the fact that relatively minor structural changes greatly impact various tissue-specific effects that, in many cases, can only be assessed in animal models or in the clinic. Experimental Section
Chemistry. General. All commercial chemicals and solvents are reagent grade and were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Grignard reagents were obtained from commercial sources. All reactions except those in aqueous media were carried out under an atmosphere of N2, in flame-dried glassware. Reactions were monitored by analytical reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Hewlett-Packard Series 1100, equipped with a diode array spectrometer ( ) 210-250 nm) and a Waters Symmetry C-8 column (3.5 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm) as the stationary phase. The mobile phases used were A: 95:5 H2O: CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA and B: CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA. The program employed ran as follows: 0 to 7 min: 5% B f 100% B; 7 to 8.5 min: 100% B; At 8.5 min, 5% B for 2.5 min, prior to the next run. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 mL/min. Additionally, thin-layer chromatography on 0.25 mm silica gel plates (E. Merck, silica gel 60 F254) was used to follow the reactions. Visualization was accomplished with UV light, KMnO4 or 5% phosphomolybdic acid in 95% ethanol.

2952 Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2003, Vol. 46, No. 14 Intermediates and final compounds were purified by flash chromatography (E. Merck silica gel 60, 230-400 mesh), crystallization, and/or semipreparative reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) using a Gilson model 306 equipped with a UV/Vis detector ( usually set to 214 nm) and a Symmetry Prep RP18 (7 µm, 19 × 150 mm column) as the stationary phase. The eluents employed were A: H2O containing 0.1%TFA and B: CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA. The program ran as follows: 0-0.5 min, 100% B; 0.5-3 min, 10% B; the compound was automatically injected at 3 min; from 3 to 4 min, 10% B; a linear gradient was then run from 10% B to 100% B over the next 16 min followed by a 2.0 min hold at 100% B. The flow rate was held constant at 20 mL/min. NMR spectra were recorded either on a Varian spectrometer, model Mercury-300 or -400 or on a Bruker DPX-400 or DMX-500 or DRX-500. Signal positions ( values) were calibrated using the residual undeuterated solvent resonance as the internal standard. Coupling constants (J values) are given in hertz (Hz). The multiplicity is indicated by one of the following: d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; br, broad. Infrared spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer i-Series FT-IR microscope coupled with a SPECTRUM 2000 FT-IR spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a Finnigan MAT900.

The complex of ERR-LBD (Ser301 to Thr553) with 18a was prepared as described previously.25,26 However, to overcome incomplete carboxymethylation of the free cysteines, a Cys f Ser triple mutant of ERR-LBD (C381S, C417S, C530S) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by three-step chromatography. The crystals of ERR-LBD mutant in complex with 18a were grown in a hanging drop vapor diffusion setup at room temperature. The reservoir buffer contained 100 mM MES buffer (pH ) 6.5), 9-11% PEG-3350 and 400 mM NaCl. The protein solution contained 9.2 mg/mL ERR-LBD301-553/mutant complex, 50 mM Tris buffer (pH ) 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 2 µM 18a. The hanging drop was made by mixing 3 µL of protein solution and 1 µL of reservoir solution. The crystals belong to the space group P6522 and have unit cell dimensions of 58.2 Å, 58.2 Å and 274.6 Å. X-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 2.28 Å have been collected at 100 K at the "Swiss Norwegian Beam Line" at the ESRF in Grenoble with an Rmerge of 5.3%. The data completeness was 77.8%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of ERR-LBD (PDB accession number 3ERT)26 as a starting model. The structure was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 23.3% (Rfree 28.7%). The root-mean-square deviations in bond length and bond angle are 0.007Å and 1.1° respectively. (For details, see Supporting Information). The structure factors and the coordinates of the refined structure were deposited in the protein structure database (PDB ID code: 1uom for the coordinate entry; r1uomsf for the structure factor entry). Biological Assays. Radioligand Binding Studies. The radioligand binding assay was performed by using 96-well microtiterplates (Picoplates, Packard) in volumes of 0.2 mL of incubation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4). The incubation mixture contained 5 nM ERR (PanVera) or 6 nM ER long form human recombinant receptors (PanVera), 8 nM [3H] 17 estradiol (180 000 total counts, Perkin-Elmer NET 517), the compound to be tested and 0.25 mg/well SPA-beads (Amersham RPNQ 0001). After incubation at rt for 2-4 h, the reaction was terminated by centrifugation at rt (10 min at 1000 g). The radioactivity was counted at least 3 h after completion of the experiment in a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was defined as the remaining radioactivity in the presence of 10 µM nonradioactive 17 -estradiol (Sigma). Assays were performed in triplicate. MCF-7 Proliferation Assay. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22) was routinely cultivated in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium High Glucose, Gibco Invitrogen Corporation, Paisley, U.K.) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM

L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycine (pen/strep) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Three days prior to an assay, MCF-7 cells were switched to DMEM Low Glucose phenol red-free29 supplemented with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS (sFBS) to deplete internal stores of steroids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, and pen/strep. Cells were trypsinized from the maintenance flask with phenol red-free trypsin (0.05%)-EDTA (0.02%) (HyClone, Logan, UT) and seeded in a 96-well plate (Nunc) at a density of 103 cells per final volume of 100 µL DMEM Low Glucose phenol red-free supplemented with 5% sFBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, and pen/strep. Twenty four hours later, fresh medium, supplemented with serial dilutions of compounds or DMSO as diluent control, was prepared and added in the presence or absence of 10-10 M 17 estradiol to triplicate microcultures. Cells were incubated for 6 days, and medium with compounds was changed once after 3 days. At the end of the incubation time, proliferation was assessed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured. This parameter relates to the amount of formazan produced,30 the quantity of which is directly proportional to the number of living cells in the culture. ERE-Luciferase Reporter Assay. HELNR and HELN , two human cervix adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from HeLa cells stably transfected with the reporter gene EREGlob-Luc-SVNeo (ERE, estrogen response element) and the expression plasmids ERR or ER , respectively, were used to quantify the antiestrogenic and estrogenic effects of compounds on ERE.31 These cells were routinely cultivated in DMEM phenol red-free, supplemented with 5% sFBS, 2 mM glutamine, pen/strep, 1 mg/mL Geneticin and 0.5 µg/mL puromycin to ensure appropriate antibiotic selection. For the assay, cells were trypsinized from the maintenance flask with phenol redfree trypsin (0.05%) - EDTA (0.02%) (HyClone, Logan, UT) and seeded in opaque 96-well plate (Nunc) at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well in a final volume of 100 µL of assay medium (DMEM phenol red-free, supplemented with 3% sFBS, 2 mM glutamine and pen/strep). Five hours later, cells were adherent. Serial dilutions of compounds or DMSO as diluent control were then added in the presence of a fixed concentration of 17 -estradiol (10-10 M in HELNR and 10-9 M in HELN ) to triplicate microcultures. Faslodex (Tocris, 10-8 M) was used as a baseline indicator. Cells were incubated for 20 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator before being processed for luciferase determination. Medium was aspirated and 100 µL of a 1:1 mixture of LucLite (Perkin-Elmer, Life Science, Boston, MA)/assay medium was added to each well. Plates were then left in the dark for 10 min before luminescence activity was determined by counting the plates for 6 s in a -TopCount (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Cassette Dosing Experiments. Rat Pharmacokinetic Cassette Standard Assay. A set of seven novel compounds plus the internal standard raloxifene (5) was administered intravenously via the femoral vein at a dose level of 1 mg/kg body weight (for each individual compound) to four female rats. Cannulas were implanted into the femoral vein for intravenous compound administration and into the femoral artery for rapid blood sampling. Compounds were administered orally by gavage at a dose level of 5 mg/kg body weight. Blood was sampled over a 24 h time period postdose (from 5 min for iv and 15 min for po). Blood samples were then processed through steps involving protein precipitation by CH3CN addition, centrifugation of the supernatant, and evaporation of the supernatant in a vacuum centrifuge. Dried residues were dissolved in MeOH/H2O (60:40 v/v) containing 1% HCOOH and analyzed by HPLC on an Uptisphere C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (particle size: 3 µm; column dimensions: 2 × 50 mm). Eluents used consisted of A: 10% CH3CN in H2O with 0.1% HCOOH (pH 2.1); B: 90% CH3CN with 10% H2O and 0.1% HCOOH (pH 2.1). A linear gradient was run from 5 to 100% B over 7 min followed by a 3 min hold at 100% B at a

Renaud et al. constant temperature of 50 °C in the column compartment. The flow rate was held constant at 0.4 mL/min. Sample injection volume was 10 µL. The flow from the HPLC system was directly introduced into the ion source of an Agilent 1100 series MS-detector (single quadrupole mass analyzer) and subjected to atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization (positive mode). All compounds were detected as protonated quasi-molecular ions [M + H]+. A structurally closely related SERM was used as an analytical internal standard. Quantification of blood levels of the parent compounds was based on a 7-level calibration curve (in triplicate) using blank rat blood samples spiked with stock solutions of external and internal standards. Rat Pharmacokinetic Cassette Validation. Raloxifene (5) alone was administered iv (1 mg/kg) and po (3 mg/kg) to four female rats each. Blood samples were taken and analyzed as described above. The pharmacokinetic data generated from this validation study were compared with those obtained for raloxifene (5) in cassette dosing experiments to check for potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Deviations exceeding the typical range of biological variability (approximately (50% max. for individual parameters) were considered strongly indicative for pharmacokinetic interactions between compounds in the cassette, and the respective data were discarded.
