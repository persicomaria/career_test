Molecular modelling The crystal structure of S. coelicolor type II dehydroquinase (PDB codes: 1GU1) was downloaded from the Brookhaven Protein Databank.[22] Hydrogens were added to the protein using SYBYL7.1 and anhydroquinate inhibitor 3 and glycerol was abstracted from the active site of the complexed protein pdb files. Crystallographic water molecules were removed from the structures, except for H2O-1221 as this is conserved in crystal structures of all type II dehydroquinases. Inhibitors were built in SYBYL7.1 and used as MOL2 files.[15] Each molecule had hydrogens added. Structures were minimised to relax bond lengths and fix angles using a Tripos force field and Gasteiger-Hückel charges calculated.[23] Ligands were docked into the active sites of the enzymes prepared above using GOLD 3.0.[16] For each independent genetic algorithm (GA) run, a maximum of 100 000 operations were performed on a population of 5 islands, each of 100 individuals. Operator weights for crossover, mutation and migration were set to 95, 95 and 10 respectively, as well as the hydrogen bonding (4.0 Å) and van der Waals (2.5 Å) parameters. To allow for development of close contacts and poor hydrogen bonds occurring at the beginning of each GA run, the initial external van der Waals (vdw) energies were cut off at 2.5kij, where kij is the depth of the vdw well between atoms i and j, and the maximum distance between a donor atom and a fitting point was set to 4 Å. Ring flipping and internal hydrogen bonds were allowed. The dockings were terminated after 25 runs for each of the inhibitors.

General Experimental All non-aqueous reactions were carried out in pre-dried glassware under an inert atmosphere (N2 or Ar). Organic solvents were freshly distilled prior to use and milli-Q deionised water was used for all biochemical work. Analytical thin layer chromatography was carried out on commercial silica gel 60 0.25 mm plates using either UV absorption or potassium permanganate stain, (3 g potassium permanganate, 20 g potassium carbonate, 5 ml of 5% sodium hydroxide, 300 ml water), for visualisation. RF values are quoted with respect to the solvent system used to develop the plate. Column chromatography was carried out using 230-400 mesh silica gel 60. Unless otherwise stated petroleum ether refers to the fraction collected between 40 ­ 60 oC. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer or a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer in deuterated solvents, as indicated.

C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer or a Bruker Avance

500 spectrometer linked to a Bruker 5mm dual Cryoprobe (operating at 100MHz and 125 MHz respectively). All chemical shifts are quoted in parts per million (ppm) . Coupling constants for 1H NMR spectroscopy are assigned where possible and are given in Hz. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FTIR spectrometer using attenuated transmittance reflectance (ATR). Liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) was carried out using an Alliance HT Waters 2795 Separations Module coupled to a Waters Micromass ZQ Quadrapole Mass Analyzer. Samples were detected using a photomultiplier detection system. Samples were run on a gradient from 10 mM ammonium acetate containing 0.1% formic acid to 95% acetonitrile over a period of 8 min.

X-ray crystallography SCDHQase was purified as previously described[24] and concentrated using a Vivaspin 500 Centricon with a 10kDa cutoff (Viva Science) to a final concentration of approximately 6mg/ml. Co-crystallisation experiments were carried out with compound 5 which was at a final concentration of 5 mM. Stock solutions of the inhibitor were adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of NaOH. The sitting drop vapour diffusion method was used for the crystallization experiments and was set up for the 114 conditions from an in-house crystallisation screen. The crystals which gave the best diffraction were grown from conditions 15% PEG 8K, 0.1M HEPES buffer pH 7.5. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the ESRF, station BM14. Data were processed and scaled using MOSFLM[25] and all further calculations were performed using the CCP4 suite of programs.[26] 180° of diffraction data was collected to 2.2 Å resolution with a merging R-factor of 11.3%. The crystals were triclinic and

molecular replacement carried out using AmoRe[27] found 8 dodecamers in the unit cell, instead of 16 which had been seen previously. Rounds of refinement was carried out using Refmac5[28] and model building using Coot[29] with unambiguous electron density in active site for compound 5. The geometry of the final model as assessed by PROCHECK[30] was good with 98.2% of residues in the strict allowed regions however the 8th dodecamer, chain G, was poorly defined compared to the other dodecamers indication disorder in its position. It is presumed that this accounts for only 8 dodecamers in the cell rather than 16 as seen for the CA1 structure[11] . This disorder accounts for the majority of the residual difference density and the poor R-factor for the final model of 27.6% and Rfree of 33.4%. The coordinates and X-ray data have been deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) codes 2CJF and R2CJFSF.

Dehydroquinase over-expression and purification Purified Streptomyces coelicolor type II dehydroquinase was kindly supplied by Professor John Coggins (Department of Biochemistry, University of Glasgow, UK) as a concentrated solution in 1:1 v/v glycerol/water (5.1 mg/ml). Aliquots of the enzyme were stored at ­20 oC. Helicobacter pylori type II dehydroquinase was over-expressed and purified as described previously.[32] Type II

dehydroquinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was over-expressed and purified containing a sixhistidine tag (His)6-tag at the N-terminus. not to affect the kinetics of the enzyme. Synthesis and determination of 3-dehydroquinate concentration 3-Dehydroquinate was synthsised (as the potassium salt) from (-) quinic acid using the method described by Le Sann et al.[33] The concentrations of 3-dehydroquinate solutions (in water) were determined from the absorbance difference at 234 nm resulting from the total conversion of an aliquot of 3-dehydroquinate to 3-dehydroshikimate by 1 µl of S. coelicolor type II dehydroquinase (5.1 mg/ml) using the kinetic assay described below. Kinetic assay for type II dehydroquinases S. coelicolor, M. tuberculosis and H. pylori type II dehydroquinases were assayed by monitoring the formation of the product, 3-dehydroshikimate. The initial rate of the reaction was measured by the increase in absorbance at 234 nm, due to the formation of the enone-carboxylate chromophore of 3dehydroshikimate ( = 1.2 x 104 M-1cm-1). The assays were performed at 25 oC in Tris-HCl buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0) for S. coelicolor and M. tuberculosis enzymes or Tris-acetate (0.05 M, pH 7.0) for H. pylori type II dehydroquinase. A standard assay for all three of the dehydroquinases includes: 100 µl of buffer (0.5 M, pH 7), 10 µl of enzyme solution (in buffer 0.05 M, pH 7), x µl of substrate (3-dehydroquinate, potassium salt) solution in water, y µl of inhibitor solution in water, (890 ­ x ­ y) µl of water. Aliquots of the enzyme were stored in 1:1 v/v glycerol/water at -20 oC. The (His)6-tag on the enzyme was shown (by KM and kcat measurements)

13

The enzyme stocks were diluted to 5.1 µg/ml (S. coelicolor type II dehydroquinase), 160 mg/ml (M. tuberculosis type II dehydroquinase) and 1.5 µg/ml (H. pylori type II dehydroquinase). Addition of 10 µl of these enzyme solutions to the assay gave final concentrations of 3.08 nM, 102 nM and 0.81 nM respectively. The assay mixture was prepared in 1 ml black-walled quartz cuvettes, and the assay was initiated by the addition of the substrate (3-dehydroquinate) to the mixture after incubating the buffer, inhibitor and enzyme at 25 oC for two min.

The kinetic parameters (KM and kcat) for the type II dehydroquinase enzymes were obtained by measuring the initial rates of reaction over a range of substrate concentrations (typically 0.25 KM ­ 10 KM). The data was fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation using the software GraFit by leastsquares fitting.[18] The values of KM and Vmax were also determined using this software and the catalytic constant, kcat was calculated from the latter value and the total enzyme concentration in the assay.

Enzyme inhibition The kinetic data for inhibition studies were obtained by measuring the initial rates of reaction over a range of inhibitor concentrations (4-5 different concentrations) at 4-5 different substrate concentrations (0.5 KM ­ 5 KM). The inhibition constants (KI) and the standard deviations associated with these values were determined using a least-squares fitting by the software GraFit.[19] GraFit was also used to carry out a F-test statistical analysis on the data, used to confirm that the data satisfied a competitive inhibition model.
