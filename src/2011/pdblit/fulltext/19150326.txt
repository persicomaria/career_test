Flavodoxin (Fld) replaces Ferredoxin (Fd) as electron carrier from Photosystem I (PSI) to Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR). A number of Anabaena Fld (AnFld) variants with replacements at the interaction surface with FNR and PSI indicated that neither polar nor hydrophobic residues resulted critical for the interactions, particularly with FNR. This suggests that the solvent exposed benzenoid surface of the Fld FMN cofactor might contribute to it. FMN has been replaced with analogues in which its 7- and/or 8-methyl groups have been replaced by chlorine and/or hydrogen. The oxidised Fld variants accept electrons from reduced FNR more efficiently than Fld, as expected from their less negative midpoint potential. However, processes with PSI (including reduction of Fld semiquinone by PSI, described here for the first time) are impeded at the steps that involve complex re-arrangement and electron transfer (ET). The groups introduced, particularly chlorine, have an electron withdrawal effect on the pyrazine and pyrimidine rings of FMN. These changes are reflected in the magnitude and orientation of the molecular dipole moment of the variants, both factors appearing critical for the re-arrangement of the finely tuned PSI:Fld complex. Processes with FNR are also slightly modulated. Despite the displacements observed, the negative end of the dipole moment points towards the surface that contains the FMN, still allowing formation of complexes competent for efficient ET. This agrees with several alternative binding modes in the FNR:Fld interaction. In conclusion, the FMN in Fld not only contributes to the redox process, but also to attain the competent interaction of Fld with FNR and PSI. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

via reduction of the soluble [2Fe­2S] Ferredoxin (Fd) by PSI, and subsequent reduction of NADP+ by Fdrd is catalysed by FerredoxinNADP+ reductase (FNR). In most cyanobacteria and some algae under low iron conditions Flavodoxin (Fld) (a FMN flavoprotein) substitutes for the Fd in this reaction. Thus, two Fldsq molecules transfer two electrons from two PSI molecules to one FNR [1­3]. The role of individual Fld residues on the protein interaction with PSI and FNR has been widely analysed using site-directed mutagenesis [4­7]. These studies have shown that the Fld interactions, particularly with FNR, are less specific than those in other ET complexes, with the bound state being composed of a dynamic ensemble of conformations rather than a single conformation [1,4,8­12]. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that in Fld the electrostatic alignment appears as one of the major determinants of the orientation of Fld on the partner surfaces and that, once Fld is close enough to its partners, the flavin atoms might be involved in the interaction [4­7,12], and are probably the only ones directly responsible for ET (Figure SP1). In Anabaena Fld (AnFld) the isoalloxazine 7- and 8-methyl groups are exposed to the solvent, as in most Flds, and present contacts with Asn58, Trp57 and Tyr94 [13]. These residues have been implicated in modulation of the midpoint

reduction potentials [14­16], and they modulate the interaction of Fld with PSI and FNR [5,6,17]. We proposed to study the roles played by positions 7 and 8 of the dimethylbenzene ring by replacing FMN in Fld with the high-potential analogues 8-nor-8-Cl-FMN, 7,8-nor-7,8Cl-FMN, and 7-nor-7-Cl,8-nor-FMN and 7-nor-8-nor-8-Cl-FMN (here in after 8-Cl-FMN, 7,8-diCl-FMN, 7-Cl,8-H-FMN and 7-H,8-Cl-FMN, Figure SP2). These analogues were chosen because they represent substitutions in the positions of the isoalloxazine ring putatively involved in protein interaction and ET, their midpoint-reduction potentials cover a narrow range (-126 mVN Em N -152 mV, Table 1) [18,19] and they have been widely used as mechanistic probes with flavoproteins [20­24]. It was anticipated that the combination of the methyl, hydrogen and chlorine replacements would produce changes that might affect the properties of the Fld surface in the environment of the FMN portion that is exposed to the solvent, and in this way affect the ability of the protein to interact with its partners and to undergo ET. Replacement of FMN in AnFld with these FMN analogues produced strong complexes that stabilise the intermediate semiquinone state of the flavin. Midpoint reduction potentials for the reconstituted Flds have been determined and the ability of these Flds to interact and exchange electrons with PSI and FNR has been analysed. In silico structural models of the complexes have been produced. Equilibration of these models by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations required the prior determination of the force field parameters for each FMNox analogue. The different properties of the new complexes compared to Fld from AnFld are discussed on the basis of the properties derived from these structural models, thus providing information about the role played by the solvent-exposed moiety of FMN in complex formation and ET between Fld and PSI or FNR. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Biological materials AnFld was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described [25]. ApoFld was prepared by treatment with 3% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C in the presence of dithiothreitol [26]. The precipitated apoprotein was separated from FMN by centrifugation and dissolved in 500 mM MOPS pH 7.0 before dialysis against 50 mM MOPS pH 7.0. Anabaena PSI particles were obtained as described [27,28]. The P700 content in PSI samples was calculated from the photoinduced absorbance changes at 820 nm,  = 6.5 mM- 1 cm- 1 [29]. Chlorophyll concentration was determined according to Arnon [30]. The chlorophyll/P700 ratio of the resulting PSI preparations was 104/1. The same batches of PSI and proteins were used throughout this study. 2.2. Production of FMN analogues RF analogues 8-nor-Cl-RF, 7,8-nor-7,8-Cl-RF, and 7-nor-7-Cl,8nor-RF were converted into the corresponding FMN forms using the

mutant H28A of FAD synthetase (FADS) from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes [31]. Reaction mixtures containing 50 M of the RF analogue, 0.5 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1.5­3 M H28A FADS in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, were incubated overnight in the dark at 37 °C. Full conversion of RF into FMN was checked by thin layer chromatography in silica-gel plates [31]. H28A FADS did not accept 7-nor-8-nor-8-Cl-RF as substrate. Therefore, it was converted into FAD using native FADS. Once the reaction was completed, FADS was separated from the flavin by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, 10000 MW cut-off). The FAD derivative was hydrolysed to the FMN derivative by incubation with Naja naja snake venom (Sigma) for 4 h at room temperature. FMN analogues were purified using a C-18 Sep-Pack Cartridge (Waters). Finally, Anabaena ApoFld was incubated with a 1.5-fold molar excess of each FMN analogue in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0 for 1 h at 25 °C. Excess flavin was then removed by ultrafiltration and the reconstituted Flds stored at -20 °C. 2.3. Spectroscopic analyses UV/Vis spectra were recorded in a Kontron Uvikon 942 or in a Cary 300 spectrophotometer, at 25 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra (500­ 600 nm, with excitation at the 445 nm/band I maximum of the flavin) were recorded at 25 °C in an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 spectrometer. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in a Chirascan Applied Photophysics spectropolarimeter in 5 mM MOPS, pH 7.0 at 5 °C, using a 1 mm pathlength cuvette in the far-UV (7 M Fld) and a 4-mm cuvette in the near-UV and Vis regions (20­30 M Fld). Unless otherwise stated, all measurements were recorded in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0 Dissociation constants (Kd), extinction coefficient changes () and free energy changes (G) for the complexes between FNRox and the different Fldox forms were obtained at 25 °C, by difference absorption spectroscopy as previously described [4,32]. Fitting of the experimental data to the theoretical equation for a 1:1 complex allowed the calculation of Kd and . Errors in the estimated G, Kd and  values were ±15%. 2.4. Determination of midpoint reduction potentials Midpoint reduction potentials for the ox/sq and sq/hq couples (Eox/sq and Esq/hq) of the reconstituted Flds were determined at 25 °C in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0 under anaerobic conditions as described [4,16,33]. The cuvette contained 10­35 M protein, 1 M redox mediators and, when photoreduction was used, 2 mM EDTA and 1­2 M deazariboflavin. Stepwise reduction of the protein was achieved by either light irradiation from a 250-W slide projector (in case of AnFld) or by stepwise dithionite addition (in case of the FMN analogues). The system was considered to be equilibrated when the potential, measured with a Sycopel Ministat potentiometer, remained stable for at least 20 min, and the UV-Vis spectrum was then recorded. The absorbance spectra allowed to determine

the concentrations of the different redox species at equilibrium in each reduction step [16]. The midpoint potentials for the two redox couples were calculated by linear regression analysis of the plots of potential versus logarithm of the concentration ratio (ox/sq or sq/ hq) according to the Nernst equation. The following dyes were used as mediators: anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate (Em,pH7 = - 174 mV), 1,2-naphthoquinone (Em,pH7 = -143 mV), and anthraquinone-2sulfonate (Em,pH7 = -225 mV) for the determination of Eox/sq and rosinduline (E m,pH7 = - 281 mV), benzylviologen (E m,pH7 = - 359 mV) and methylviologen (Em,pH7 = - 446 mV) for the determination of Esq/hq. Error in the Eox/sq and Esq/hq determination was estimated to be ±5 mV. 2.5. Laser-flash fast kinetics absorption spectroscopy measurements ET processes between PSI and Fld were studied by laser-flash absorption spectroscopy at 25 °C as described [4,17,34]. Briefly, PSI photoexcitation was achieved by irradiating the sample with a 337 nm laser-flash (PTI PL-2300 nitrogen laser; flash duration, 0.6 ns). Flash-induced absorbance changes were followed by illuminating the sample with a perpendicular monochromatic light beam at the desired wavelength, the signal being detected by a photomultiplier, amplified and recorded in a digital oscilloscope. For the study of the interaction and ET between PSI and Fldox, the standard reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 20 mM Tricine/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.03% -dodecyl maltoside (DDM), an amount of PSI-enriched particles equivalent to 50 g of chlorophyll ml- 1, 50 nM phenazine methosulfate (PMS), 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM sodium ascorbate, and Fld at varying concentrations. This amount of PMS is enough to reduce PSI in the time between flashes by acting as a high-turnover intermediate between the excess of ascorbate present in the sample and PSI. Fldsq formation was monitored between 565 and 580 nm, depending on the spectra of the Fld variant. Experiments at different MgCl2 concentrations were carried out under the same conditions with a final Fld concentration of 20 M. For the analysis of the ET from PSI to Fldsq, a mixture containing only the Tricine/KOH buffer, PMS and MgCl2 was degassed by argon bubbling for at least 40 min. DDM, PSI, Fld and sodium ascorbate were subsequently added, together with 10 nM FNR and 0.5 mM NADPH. The reaction mixture was then incubated for 5 min to allow Fldsq formation by the NADPH/FNR system [1,2,35]. After laser irradiation, Fldsq disappearance was followed at 570 nm, an isosbestic point for Anabaena PSI oxidation-reduction. Stepwise addition of Fld, to produce the concentration profile dependence, was accompanied with the injection of 50­100 l of air into the cuvette to avoid the accumulation of Fldhq, followed by a few minutes incubation to ensure generation of Fldsq.

In both type of experiments each kinetic trace was the average of 40­50 measurements, with 30 s time spacing between flashes [36]. For the systems showing monophasic traces, kinetic analyses were carried out according to the two-step reaction mechanisms previously proposed [36,37]. For the systems showing biphasic kinetic traces, kon, koff and Kr minimal values for the additional re-arrangement step in the reaction mechanism were determined according to Sigfridsson et al. [38]. The estimated error in the observed pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) determination was less than 20%, based on reproducibility and signal-to-noise ratios. Errors in the values estimated for the complex association constant (Ka) and the first-order ET rate constant (ket) were ±15 and ±5 %, respectively. 2.6. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements The reaction between FNRhq (produced by photoreduction with 5deazariboflavin) and the reconstituted Fldox variants was analysed in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions using an Applied Photophysics SX17.MV spectrophotometer [17,32]. The proteins were mixed at a  1:1 molar ratio, with a final concentration of 10 M and evolution of the processes was followed in the 400­ 800 nm range using a photodiode detector. The apparent observed rate constants (kap) were calculated by fitting the evolution of the semiquinone maxima for each Fld ( 570­590 nm) to mono- or biexponential processes. Estimated errors in the determined values were ±15%. 2.7. Structural models for Flds reconstituted with different FMN analogues In silico reconstituted Fld models were produced by replacing the FMNox cofactor in the three-dimensional structure of AnFldox (PDB code: 1FLV) with each of the corresponding FMN analogues. To determine the force field parameters for FMNox and its different analogues the geometries of their molecular structures (including FMNox) were optimized using Gaussian 03 with a Hartree­Fock method and 6­31G basis set [39]. The corresponding molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) were calculated using the same methodology. The calculated MEP were used to derive the restrained potential charges (RESP) using the RED program [40]. Antechamber programs were used to assign the atom and bond types of the general amber force field and the PARMCHK to add missing parameters [41,42]. MD simulations were performed with AMBER 9.0 [41]. The force field was amber94 with the addition of the parameters derived for the FMNox analogues. Each molecular system was neutralised by the addition of 17 sodium ions, and solvated with TIP3P water model in an

Solvent molecules and counter ions were relaxed and allowed to redistribute around the restrained protein molecule by minimization with 1000 steps of Steepest Descent (SD) and 2000 steps of Conjugate Gradient (CG), the protein atoms were constrained with a harmonic force constant of 500 kcal/mol Å2. A second energy minimization was carried out with 2000 steps SD and 3000 steps of CG also allowing protein relaxation. The resulting system was heated from 0 K to 300 K at constant volume with the protein atoms constrained with a harmonic force constant of 10 kcal/mol Å2. The system was then equilibrated during 100 ps at 300 K, using a

Langevine temperature equilibration algorithm, and 1 atm, with periodic boundary conditions, and using the Particle Mesh Ewald method to treat long-range electrostatic interactions. Production runs consisted of 8­10 ns of MD with 2 fs steps. Temperature was kept at 300 K using a Berendsen constant temperature algorithm and the pressure at 1 atm using a weak-coupling pressure algorithm. System coordinates were collected every 2 ps. During equilibration and simulations the leapfrog Verlet integration scheme and the SHAKE algorithm were used. Three-dimensional structures and trajectories were visually inspected using the programs PyMOL and VMD [43,44]. Interatomic distances

The extinction coefficient for these Fldsq variants was in general smaller than that of AnFldsq (Table SP1). The maximum extent of semiquinone stabilisation for 8-Cl-FMN:Fld, 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fld and 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fld was similar to that of AnFld ( 97%), while it decreased for 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fld (70%). Finally, the flavin fluorescence quenching levels observed when ApoFld interacted with the FMN analogues are slightly lower than reported for FMN, with 7,8diCl-FMN:Fld and 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fld still showing 9 % of the free flavin emission intensity (b3% for FMN in Fld) [15]. 3.2. Midpoint reduction potentials of the Fld variants The Em, Eox/sq and Esq/hq of the free FMN analogues used in this work and modified at positions 7 and 8 were 55­80 mV less negative than those of free FMN (Table 1) [45­48]. Similarly, Em, Eox/sq and Esq/ hq of their reconstituted Flds were less negative than those of AnFld, being the changes larger in Esq/hq (70­210 mV less negative) than in Eox/sq (60­105 mV less negative) (Table 1, Fig. 2). As observed for FMN, the binding of the FMN analogues to ApoFld shifted their Eox/sq to less negative values and the Esq/hq to more negative ones, and stabilised the flavin semiquinone (Table 1). This shift in Eox/sq was in general slightly larger for the FMN analogues (Ebound-free from +122 to +143 mV) than for FMN (Ebound-free = +119 mV), while the shift in Esq/hq was smaller (Ebound-free from -202 to -324 mV versus Ebound-free = -331 mV) (Table 1). 8-Cl-FMN and, especially, 7-H,8-Cl-FMN showed the Ebound-free values most similar to FMN, while 7-Cl,8-H-FMN and, in particular, 7,8-diCl-FMN, showed considerably smaller values (Table 1). 3.3 Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the reduction of Fldox and Fldsq variants by PSI Although the Fldsq/Fldhq couple is the one thought to be involved in ET from PSI to FNR, a physiological role for the Fldox/Fldsq one cannot be ruled out [4,10,35]. Therefore, one-electron reduction of both Fldox and Fldsq by PSI has been analysed for the Fld variants using laser-flash absorption spectroscopy. The electron reduction of all Fldox variants by PSI showed a monoexponential kinetic trace, as observed for AnFld [34]. However, reduction of 8-Cl-FMN:Fldox, 7-Cl,8-H-FMN: Fldox and, particularly, 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fldox became highly impaired (Fig. 3A). The nonlinear dependences of the kobs on Fldox concentration suggest that a transient PSI:Fldox complex is formed prior to ET in these reactions, as reported for AnFld. Minimal values for both the Ka for the PSI:Fldox complex formation and the ket can be determined (Fig. 3A and Table 2) [7,34]. Replacement of the FMN methyl groups hardly affected Ka, but, with the exception of 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fld, all the Fldox variants were much poorer electron acceptors from PSI (Table 2). A re-arrangement of the initial PSI:Fldox interaction complex to achieve optimal ET is reflected for AnFld on the biphasic dependence of kobs with MgCl2 concentration (Fig. 3B) [34,36]. This

a A linear dependence was observed and only the second-order rate constant could be determined. b AnFld data were again determined in the present study obtaining similar values to those previously reported [17].

and angles, as well as the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from a given structure, were monitored using PTRAJ [41]. Accessible surface area (ASA) was estimated with NACCESS (http://www. bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess). The van der Waals radii of analogues used for determining the ASA were the same as in the MD, and a spherical probe with a radius of 1.5 Å was used. 3. Results 3.1. Spectral properties of the Flds reconstituted with FMN analogues The far-UV CD spectra of Flds reconstituted with different FMN analogues indicate no major structural perturbations in the protein folding. However, position and relative intensities of minima, maxima and shoulders varied in the near-UV and Vis for 7-H,8-ClFMN:Fld, 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fld and 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fld (Fig. 1). These data suggest changes in the environment of protein aromatic residues, as well as in the flavin isoalloxazine ring environment. The general shape of the Vis absorbance spectra of reconstituted Flds is similar to that of AnFld, but differences occur in the position of maxima, their extinction coefficients and the relative intensities of their respective two flavin bands, reflecting the differences also observed for the free FMN analogues (Figure SP2, Table SP1). Upon interaction with ApoFld, the flavin bands of the free FMN analogues are red-shifted (band I by 12­18 nm; band II by 1­4 nm) (Figure SP2, Table SP1). All the Fld variants stabilised the blue neutral semiquinone (Fig. 2A). The shape and the positions of their semiquinone long-wavelength band absorbance maxima, as well as the isosbestic points for their ox/sq transitions, are generally different from those of AnFldsq (Table SP1). 8-Cl-FMN:Fldsq, 7,8diCl-FMN:Fldsq and 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fldsq showed two maxima in the neutral semiquinone band, which are red-shifted compared to the single absortium maximum for AnFldsq. The ox/sq isosbestic point for 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fld is also red-shifted. 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldsq had a single maximum that was blue-shifted, as was the isosbestic point.

bell-shaped profile is also observed for 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fld, and 7-Cl,8H-FMN:Fld (Fig. 3B), but the kobs maxima are shifted to slightly lower salt concentrations (about 5­10 mM). For 8-Cl-FMN:Fld and 7,8-di-ClFMN:Fld, the lack of effect of MgCl2 on kobs correlates with the low ET rates observed at all salt concentrations. Reduction of AnFldsq and 8-Cl-FMN:Fldsq by PSI showed biphasic kinetic traces, with a first fast phase, whose amplitude increases with protein concentration up to reach a maximum value (Fig. 3C), and a subsequent slower phase with kobs values depending on the Fld concentration and following a saturation profile (Fig. 3D). Biphasic kinetics have been previously reported for similar systems from other cyanobacteria [35,49] (and see below). This kinetic behaviour conforms to a model in which the initial complex, whose formation is characterised by a Ka, undergoes a reorganization step to an optimal configuration, described by a re-arrangement constant, Kr, for the ET to take place [38]:
kon ket Ka Fldsq + PSIred T ðFldsq : PSIred Þ T ðFldsq : PSIred Þ  Fldhq + PSIox koff

formation with FNRox very similar to those of AnFld. This suggests that replacement of the FMN methyl groups on Fld does not affect binding to the FNR flavin environment. 3.5. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the ET processes from FNRhq to the Fld variants The reaction of FNRhq with AnFldox has been shown as a relatively slow two-step process due to initial production of Fldsq and FNRsq, followed by the reduction of a second Fldox molecule by the FNRsq produced in the first step [6,17,32]. A similar behaviour is observed for

where K r = kon = koff According to this model, the ket value can be obtained directly from the kobs for the fast phase. However, in our case this fast phase mainly occurred within the dead time of the instrument (50 s), indicating a minimal ket value of about 50000 s- 1, which is in the order of those described for other cyanobacterial systems [35,49]. Values for Ka and kon can be estimated from the extrapolation of kobs for the slow phase to infinite Fld concentration (Fig. 3D) [37,38]. Thus, the values obtained for kon (2200 s- 1 and 2800 s- 1 for AnFldsq and 8-Cl-FMN: Fldsq, respectively) and Ka (Table 2) were similar for both Fld variants. Moreover, from the extrapolation of the percentage of fast phase -with regard to the total signal amplitude- to infinite acceptor concentration (Fig. 3C) and the values of kon previously determined, an estimation of koff (750 s- 1 and 700 s- 1 for AnFldsq and 8-Cl-FMN: Fldsq, respectively), and then also for Kr (Table 2), can be obtained [38]. Again, similar values for all these kinetic constants were calculated for both variants (Table 2). In contrast to AnFld, the PSImediated reduction of 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldsq, 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fldsq and 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fldsq result in monoexponential kinetic behaviour, where kobs is linearly dependent on the Fldsq concentration (Fig. 3D), as previously reported for the slower phase in other PSI systems when interacting with AnFld [35,49]. These data suggest that for these Fld variants, ET from PSI to Fldsq occurs by a collisional-type mechanism, without formation of a kinetically-detectable complex, and is characterised by a second-order rate constant, k2 (Table 2) [4,7]. It is interesting to compare the kinetic behaviour of the AnFldsq reported here for the slower phase (i.e., the interaction step), with that previously shown for other cyanobacterial systems [35,49]. Thus, whereas the different nature of the two constants (Ka here vs. k2 in [35,49]) precludes a direct comparison, the kobs values are of similar magnitude. Interestingly, the k2 value here obtained for the 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldsq is similar to the k2 values for the slower phase previously reported for the systems of Synechocystis and Synechococcus, thereby suggesting a fine tuning in the optimal transient complex that is easily affected by minor changes at the protein interacting surfaces. 3.4. The interaction of the Fldox variants with FNRox The Fldox:FNRox difference spectrum obtained for the different Fld variants showed similar perturbations to those reported for the AnFld complex, with only minor shifts in the positions of the flavin band maxima (Table 3) [17,32]. Additionally, the magnitude of difference spectra formed upon FNRox titration with the different reconstituted Fldoxs reached saturation, allowing determination of Kd and G (Table 3). All the Fldox variants exhibited values for complex

the reduction of the reconstituted Flds with FMN analogues, the kinetic traces in the 600 nm semiquinone region also fitting a biphasic process (Fig. 4). The amplitudes of the kinetic traces are in general similar to or within a factor of 1.5 (larger for most of the variants) of those observed for the reaction with AnFldox, the amplitude for the second process being within 2-fold (usually larger) that of the first one. Compared with AnFld, the Fldoxs reconstituted with the FMN analogues are better electron acceptors from both FNRhq and FNRsq (Table 3). Such behaviour is particularly clear for 8-Cl-FMN:Fld, 7Cl-,8-H-FMN:Fld and 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fld and is in agreement with the more positive midpoint potentials of these Fld variants. The physiological ET from Fldhq to FNR was not analysed, since the Esq/hq values for these Fld variants suggest that very little reduction of FNR will occur. 3.6. Three-dimensional models for reconstituted Flds Replacement of the 8-methyl group by chlorine produces an increase in the negative character of the C(8) and a decrease of the negative charge density on the pyrazine and pyrimidine rings (Fig. 5). Such effects are greater when the 7- and 8-methyl groups are simultaneously replaced, either one with a Cl and the other one with an H, but more especially, if both of them are simultaneously replaced with Cl. Therefore, as expected, the substituents introduced at positions 7- and 8- of FMNox have an electron withdrawal effect on the pyrazine and pyrimidine rings. To validate the method used for the production of 3D models for the complexes of these FMNox analogues with Anabaena ApoFld, AnFld was treated in the same way. Using the calculated parameters for free FMNox, the AnFldox model provided a structure that after MD simulation gave a r.m.s.d. backbone of 1.3 Å with regard to the crystallographic structure of AnFldox [13]. The r.m.s.d. value was under 1.4 Å when comparing the models of Fld reconstituted with FMN analogues and the model of Fld reconstituted with FMN. Slightly different relative orientations were observed between the benzene ring of the isoalloxazine and the side chain of Trp57 along

the MD for the different variants. However, the orientation of Tyr94 compared to the flavin ring and the distance and orientation of the putative H-bond between Ile59NH and the N(5) positions of FMNox are the same as in AnFld (not shown) [13]. As a consequence of the modifications introduced in the free FMNox, minor differences in the solvent accessibility of the benzene moiety of the flavin ring are observed (Table SP2), and solvent accessibility is only substantially increased for C(7) and C(8) when the substituent at each position is a proton. 4. Discussion Changes at the FMN benzenoid methyl groups do not prevent the corresponding Fldoxs from accepting electrons from PSI, FNRhq or FNRsq following transient complex formation, and they have only little effect on the strength of the PSI:Fldox and FNRox:Fldox interactions (Fig. 3A and B, Tables 2 and 3). However, only 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldox retains the ket in accepting electrons from PSI (Fig. 3A), and a poor and reverse correlation is observed between these ket values and Eox/sq (Fig. 7A), but do maintain similar Ka values. Thus, subtle changes in the cofactor area of Fld severely affect the ET step whereas the interaction affinity remains unaffected, indicating again the fine tuning in the productive ET complex. Reduction of AnFldsq by PSI, described here for the first time, shows the biphasic kinetics previously observed in the corresponding Synechocystis and Synechococcus systems [35], but it differs from the others in a major way in that the slow phase becomes saturated at high protein concentration (Table 2, Fig. 3C and D). None of the Fld variants, except 8-Cl-FMN:Fld, exhibit the characteristic biphasic kinetic behaviour of AnFld. However, the linear dependence of kobs on protein concentration observed for the variants 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldsq, 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fldsq and 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fldsq suggests that the modifications in the cofactor alter the bimolecular interaction step. In fact, the complex formed between PSI and Fld seems to be somewhat delicate and in other cyanobacteria linear dependencies have been observed [35,50]. While the values for kobs and k2 for 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:

Fldsq are similar to those observed in the equivalent Synechocystis and Synechococcus Fld, the values for 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fldsq and 7,8-diClFMN:Fldsq show that a drastic decrease in reactivity has occurred, although the driving force of the ET reaction for these variants has actually increased (Table 1). The kobs values for 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldsq are considerably greater than those of AnFld at similar protein concentrations. This could be due to the enhancement in the driving force of the reaction, but might also indicate that the native complex is not optimised for ET [4]. Notable is the opposite behaviour of 8-ClFMN:Fld in its oxidised and semiquinone forms when reduced by PSI (Fig. 3): whereas the semiquinone efficiently reacts with PSI, and is the only variant that maintains the biphasic behaviour of AnFld, the oxidised species shows a greatly diminished reactivity. All of these data indicate that the methyl groups of FMN, as well as the cofactor redox state, contribute to the re-orientation of Fld in the PSI docking site. The Fldox variants are more rapidly reduced by both FNRhq and FNRsq than AnFldox (Table 3, Fig. 4), in agreement with the increase in the reaction driving force expected from their less negative Eox/sq values (Table 1). Nevertheless, although a positive correlation exists between the rate constants for those processes and Eox/sq, some of the points diverge from the correlation, in particular 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldox (Fig. 7B). This observation suggests that the ET competent complex produced between FNR and 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fldox is less optimized for ET than that with AnFldox, while interactions with other variants, as 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fldox, might be more optimized than AnFld. Therefore, although the driving force of the reaction contributes greatly to the faster ET processes, the characteristics of the groups at the 7- and 8positions of FMN must in someway modulate the competent ET orientation of Fld on the FNR.

The models produced for these Fldox variants show a certain surface flexibility, including the FMN environment, as expected for a globular protein. Therefore, Fld will not behave as a rigid body in the interaction with its partners. Previous studies suggest that in the Fld: FNR system interactions do not rely on a precise complementary surface of the reacting molecules and several ensembles might be competent for ET [4]. Therefore, it is not probable that the functional divergences observed here between these variants will arise only from changes in the shape of their surface. Similarly, the MEP surfaces calculated for the different Fldoxs structural models at different points along the equilibrium of the MD simulation show only minor divergences (Fig. 6A). In all cases the Fld interaction surface that contains the FMN shows a strong negative potential, apparently only slightly increased in 8-Cl-FMN:Fldox. However, changes in the averaged magnitude of the molecular dipole moment can be predicted between the variants (Fig. 6A and B) and, correlations between the rate constants and the averaged magnitude of the molecular dipole moment follow similar patterns to those discussed above for Eox/sq (Fig. 7). This indicates that the magnitude of the molecular dipole moment contributes to the re-arrangements required for a reaction-competent interaction. The dispersion of the experimental points from the correlation fittings, and particularly the negative correlations observed with PSI, suggests that other factors apart from the midpoint reduction potentials and the magnitude of the molecular dipole moment contribute to the observed effects. The initial orientation driven by the alignment of dipole moment of the Fld molecule with that of the partner has also been reported as a critical factor in this system [4]. Fig. 6C shows the spatial distribution along the MD equilibrium of the molecular dipole moment for the different reconstituted Fldoxs. Considerable shifts in the orientation of the

molecular dipole moment appear to be produced for 8-Cl-FMN:Fld and 7,8-diCl-FMN:Fld, while smaller deviations are predicted for 7Cl,8-H-FMN:Fld and 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fld. These shifts produced displacements in the orientation of the negative end of the dipole moment associated with the flavin ring, and, therefore, in the docking orientations between these Flds and FNR or PSI. As mentioned above, the effect in the change of the dipole moment orientation appears much more critical in the processes with PSI than in those with FNR. This agrees with the proposal of alternative productive binding modes between FNR and Fld [1,4], while production of the ET competent PSIFMN:Fld interactions appears to be much more sensitive to subtle changes in the orientation [35]. It has been suggested that linear electron transport between PSI and FNR might occur through a ternary PSI:Fd:FNR or PSI:Fld:FNR complex. However, no direct interaction between PSI and FNR could be demonstrated in vivo [50], and our data indicate that the same surface of Fld around its FMN cofactor has to interact with both PSI and FNR, and both contacts cannot occur simultaneously. Therefore, the architecture of such putative interaction remains unknown. Finally, the study of the role of the substituents at positions 7 and 8 of the isoalloxazine is also of mechanistic interest because of the putative role of these positions as gates for the electrons entering and leaving the flavin ring. In this context, changes in the ASA of the benzene ring position might contribute to changes in reactivity. The changes are small for the variants produced (Table SP2), and only when a proton substitutes for either the 7- or 8-methyls is a considerable increase in the C(7) and C(8) ASA observed. Taking into account that 7-H,8-Cl-FMN:Fld and 7-Cl,8-H-FMN:Fld are the variants that show the greater divergence from the correlations of Fig. 7, changes in ASA might be affecting the reactivity. However, since all variants are able to accept electrons from FNR, these methyls are not critical for the ET process.

In conclusion, subtle changes in the isoalloxazine structure influence the Fld binding abilities and modulate the ET processes by producing different orientations on the surfaces of the partners. This strongly suggests that the FMN group, in addition to its participation in the ET process, contributes to the interaction of Fld with different structural partners and particularly to the re-arrangement of the initial PSI-FMN:Fld interaction.
