SHEPHERD, M. G., GHAZALI, H. M., AND SULLIVAN, P. A. 1985. ~-Acetyl-~-glucosami~e kinase and germ-tube formation in Candidu albicans. Experimental Mycology 4, 147-1.9. A'Acetyl-D-ghmosamine kinase (GlcNAc kinase, EC 2.7.1.59), the specific enzyme required for the phosphorylation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) to N-acetylgiucosamine 6-phosphate, ~2s found to be an inducible enzyme in Candida albicans. The pattern of GlcNAc kinase induction was examined under conditions where germ-tube formation was elicited and wbere blastospores metabolized GlcNAc with no change in morphology. There was no change in either the time course or the extent of GlcNAc kinase induction, indicating that this enzyme is not a control point for the dimorphic development in C. albicans. A low basal level of GlcNAc kinase activity was found in noninduced cells of C. albicans but this increased 20- to 30-fold after the addition of GlcNAc to the cell suspension. GlcNAc is both an inducer and a substrate for the enzyme; ATP and Mg"+ were also required for activity. The K, values for GlcNAc and ATP are 1.9 and 1.3 mM, respectively. ADP was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to GlcNAc with a Ki value of7.1 mu,. UDP-GlcNAc and glucosamine 6-phosphate had no effect on GlcNAc kinase activity. The presence of ethidium bromide (an inhibitor of transcription) or trichodermin (an inhibitor of translation) in cell suspensions of C. albicans inhibited the increase in GlcNAc kinase specific activity. The glucose analogs, cY-methylglucopyranoside and 3-0-methylglucose, enhanced the formation of germ tubes by C. albicans but the induction of GlcNAc kinase was not affected. 2-Deoxyglucose. an inhibitor of germ-tube formation, had no effect on the induction of GlcNAc kinase. INDEX DESCRIPTORS: N-acetylglucosamine kinase; N-acetylglucosamine; germ tubes: Cart&& albicans: trichodermin: trichodermin and protein turnover.

IV-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)' can induce germ-tube formation in yeast cells of Can&da albicans (Simonetti et al., 1974; Shepherd et al., 1980), and more than 90% of the blastospores form germ tubes after 3 h incubation if they have been conditioned by starvation (Shepherd et al., 1980). Simonetti et al. (1974) suggested that induction of germ-tube formation by GlcNAc may he related to the regulation of chitin synthesis. The incorporation of GlcNAc into chitin was ten times greater for hyphal cells than for blastospores of C. al&cans (Braun and Calderone, 1978). Chiew et al. (1980) showed that there was a fivefold activation of chitin synthase during germination. Further, the chitin content of cell walls increased fivefold during germination

(Chiew, unpublished results). The in tion of germ-tube formation in C. albicans occurs at 37°C but not at lower t~rn~e~atures (Mattia and Cassone, 1979). It was thus of hrterest to ex the enzymes for GlcNAc m conditions which elicit g tion. GlcNAc kinase is th GlcNAc metabolism sues it is an allosteric enzyme UDP-GPcNAc and GlcNAc act as feedback inhibitors (keloir et a/., 19.58; Datta, 1970; Datta 1971). In f~~~~~ systems GlcNAc kinase is inducible and both transcription and translation ar (McGarrahan and Maley, tacharya et al., 2974; Singh 1979).

has also been reported by Singh and Datta (1979). The pathway for GlcNAc metabolism is summarized in Fig. 1. It would appear that an essential feature in the control of germ-tube formation is the partitioning of GlcNAc between cell wall polymer synthesis (e.g., chitin) and catabolism via fructose 6-phosphate. The branch point for their partitioning is at GlcNAc 6phosphate and this report is on the enzyme GlcNAc kinase which catalyzes the formation of this metabolite.

nential-phase yeast cells remain as blastospores. With the conditioned yeast cells, however, more than 90% of the blastospores will form germ tubes after 3 h. Cells were resuspended in 0.01 M imidazoleCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2 mM MnCl, and 2.5 mM GlcNAc to give a cell density of 0.8 x lo8 cells/ml. A 200-ml suspension was dispensed into a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubated in a gyratory shaker (200 rpm) at 37°C. Effect of inhibitors on GlcNAc kinase induction. Cells, resuspended in the germination buffer as described above, were preincubated with an inhibitor for `/ hr at 37°C before the addition of GlcNAc. Incubation with shaking was then continued at 37°C. Preparation of cell-free extracts. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with distilled water. The cells were d in 0.1 M Tris - HCl buffer, 5 mm glass beads (1:2:2, w/v/w). A cell-free extract was obtained by the mixture at 4000 rpm (2 X 20 s) aun homogenizer which was cooled by compressed carbon dioxide. The glass beads and cell wall debris were removed by Ce~~rifugatioR at 1OOOg and the supernatant obtained was centrifuged again at 27,OOQg for 45 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was stored at either 4 or -28°C. Enzyme assay for GlcNAc kinase. GlcNAc kinase activity in cell-free extracts was measured by a procedure analogous to that described for thymidine kinase (Bresnick and Karjala, 1964). The assay system (final volume, 220 ~1) consisted of 60 ~1500 glycine-NaGH buffer, pH 9.0, plus rn~ MgCl,; 40 ~1 25 mM N-acetyl[ l-14C]glucosamine (0.7 &i/ml); 20 ~1.50 mM ; 50 ,ul of cell-free extract; and 50 ~1 of led water.

cromoles of radioactive product produced (cellulose paper assay) and the micromoles of ATP utilized (luciferase assay) over the lo-min reaction time. This observation allowed us to use the simpler and more rapid cellulose paper procedure as the routine assay. Kinetic data were analyzed by the direct linear plot method of Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden (1974) using a program developed for a Hewlett-Packard 9821A calculator. Measurement of protein and RNA synthesis. Protein and RNA synthesis were measured by following the incorporation of L-[14C]leucine and [8-3H]adenine into trichloroacetic acid precipitates as described by Shepherd et al. (1980). Protein estimation. Protein was estimated by the modified Lowry method (Eggstein and Kreutz, 1967) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard. Synthesis of GlcNAc &phosphate. GlcNAc 6-phosphate was synthesized from glucosamine 6-phosphate and acetic anhydride using the method described by Distler et al. (1958). The reaction mixture was transferred to a column (1.5 x 20 cm) containing 35 ml of Dowex 5OW-X8, H+ resin (mesh size, 20-50) and washed with 120 ml of distilled water. The eluate collected was concentrated in vacua to about 20 ml. Traces of glucosamine 6-phosphate were removed by passing the concentrated eluate through a column (2 x 16 cm) containing 50 ml of AG l-X8 acetate-form resin (Bio-Rad; mesh size, 200-400). The resin was irrigated with 0.05 M HCl and 20-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 30-40 were pooled and titrated with a saturated solution of silver carbonate solution to remove traces of chloride. The solution was then filtered (Whatman No. 1) and passed through Dowex 50, H+ resin to remove Ag ions from the solution. The combined filtrate and washings (about 400 ml) were concentrated to 50-100 ml in vacua and neutralized with 5 M NH,OH before lyophilizing. The purity of this preparation

was determined by paper chromatography (see Results). The solid was stored at -20°C. Identification of assay products. The components of the enzyme assay were separated by paper chromatography (Whatman No. 1) using a solvent of isobutyric acid: 1 M amm0nia:O.l M EDTA (5:3:0.1, v/v). The following standards were also chromatographed: glucosamine, glucosamine 6phosphate, glucosamine l-phosphate, GlcNAc, and GlcNAc 6-phosphate. After chromatography (24 h) the aminosugars were detected with the Elson and Morgan reagent (1933). Radioactive scanning and counting. Strips of chromatograms containing radioactive materials were scanned using a Packard radioactive scanner Model 7200 and recorded on a Packard recording ratemeter Model 385. The area on a strip corresponding to a radioactive peak was cut away and placed in a vial containing Bray scintillant before counting in a liquid scintillation counter.

Induction of GlcNAc C. albicans

Kinase in

The time course for the induction of GlcNAc kinase by 2.5 mM GlcNAc in exponential-phase yeast cells and conditioned yeast cells of C. albicans is shown in Fig. 2. Although GlcNAc kinase was induced in both cell suspensions of C. albicans, only the conditioned yeast cells germinated. After 3 hours incubation, microscopic examination revealed that 90% of the conditioned cells had formed germ tubes. In some cases more than one germ tube per cell was observed. Clumping of cells occurred for both germinating conditioned cells and nongerminating exponential-phase cells. A low basal level of GlcNAc kinase was always present in noninduced yeast cells. After GlcNAc was added to the yeast sus-

pension, there was a lag of approximately I/ hour before a period of increasing GlcNAc kinase activity was observed. The maximum activity was reached at 3 hours and during this period, the increase in specific activity was between 20- and 30-fold. The maximum specific activity corresponds to the time that all the GlcNAc has been removed from the medium (Chiew, unpublished) and a decline in specific activity occurs after 3 hours (Fig. 2). This decline in activity appears to be due to the removal of GlcNAc since a second addition of this compound resulted in a further increase in GfcNAc kinase activity (Fig. 3). The effect of adding an excess of GlcNAc on the induction of GlcNAc kinase in conditioned yeast cells of C. albicans was also tested (Fig. 3) where the cells were incubated with 20 mu GlcNAc. A lag period was again detected before a rapid increase in enzyme activity was observed. The enzyme attained maximum activity at 3 hours but now instead of decreasing in activity (Fig. 2) the specific activity of the kinase

Note. The induction of GlcNAc kinase and the extent of germ-tube formation were examined in conditioned yeast cells using the compounds described above (2.5 mM final concentration) as inducers. After 3 h the enzyme specific activity and the extent of germination were determined. The specific activity of GlcNAc kinase at zero time (constitute level) was 0.07 unit/mg protein; the values shown are the means of at least three determinations.

The compounds listed in Table 2 were examined for their effect on the induction of GlcNAc kinase because they affect germination. o-Methylglucopyranoside and 3-O-methylglucose enhanced germination of exponential-phase cells while 2-deoxyglucose inhibited the formation of germ tubes with exponential-phase and conditioned cells. Azaserine, an antibiotic analog of glutamine, has been demonstrated to inhibit both GlcNAc-induced and glucose plus glutamine-induced germ-tube formation in C. albicans (Shepherd et al., 1980). Azaserine has also been shown to

inhibit purine biosynthesis (Levenberg et ai., 1957). With C. albicans it has been shown that mycelial conversion would not occur in the presence of cysteine or any SH compounds (Nickerson and Falcone, 1956; Simonetti et al., 1974), and Nickerson and van Rij (1949) have shown that cobalttreated yeast cells fail to form cross walls during mycelial formation. As shown in Table 2, these compounds did not affect the induction of GlcNAc kinase even though 2-deoxyglucose and azaserine inhibited germ-tube formation. Nystatin (52 units/ml) and amphotericin B

The cancer chemotherapeutic agent mithramycin did not affect either germ-tube formation or GlcNAc kinase induction at a final concentration of 20 pg/ml. The Effect of Protein, Synthesis Inhibitors Induction RNA, and DNA on GlcNAc Kinase

In order to establish that GlcNAc kinase induction involved gene expression the effect of a number of inhibitors of protein, NA, and DNA synthesis was investigated. In these experiments, exponentialphase yeast cells, conditioned yeast cells, and mercaptoethanol-treated cells of C. albicans were used. These cells were preincubated with the inhibitors for r/z hour before the addition of GlcNAc to the cell suspension. The activity of the kinase 3 hours ubation with GlcNAc was then as described under Materials As shown in Table 3, trichodermin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis in C. albicans (Shepherd et al., 1980), and ethidium bromide, a known inhibitor of RNA synthesis in yeast (Tgnnesen and Friesen, 1973), caused 80 and 70% inhibition of GlcNAc inase induction, respectively. Complete mhibition was obtained with 30 PM trichodermin. Germ-tube formation was com-

pletely inhibited in the presence of these two compounds. The addition of tric dermin 1 and 2% hours after the ~~~~~t~~~ of GlcNAc kinase inhibited increase in the specific acti enzyme which then remaine (Fig. 4).

Exponential-phase yeast cells of C. albicans were resuspended in germinating buffer and 2.5 rnM GlcNAc was added to initiate the induction of GlcNAc kinase.

served with the compounds (at a final concentration of 5 mM) a-methylglucopyranoside, 3-O-methylglucose, N-acetylmannosamine, GlcNAc 6-phosphate, and glucosamine 6-phosphate. However, 2deoxyglucose (5 mM), UDP-GlcNAc (20 mrvi), and ADP (4 mM) resulted in percentage inhibitions of 40, 24, and 21, respectively. When the concentration of ATP in the assay was increased the inhibition by 2-deoxyglucose was abolished which indicated that the 2-deoxyglucose was competing for the ATP and was probably phosphorylated by a different kinase. The inhibition by ADP was analyzed by the method of Cornish-Bowden (1974) and was found to be noncompetitive with respect to GlcNAc (Ki = 7.1 mM) (Fig. 5). The products of the reaction mixture were identified by paper chromatography. In the isobutyric acid:ammonia:EDTA solvent system RGlcNAc values (in parentheses) were: GlcNAc (l.O), GlcNAc 6-phosphate (0.36), glucosamine &phosphate (O-53), glucosamine l-phosphate (0.58). Table 4 shows that the radioactive compounds present after a lo-minute GlcNAc kinase assay were GlcNAc, GlcNAc 6-phosphate, and glucosamine 6-phosphate. Of the two products formed,

GlcNAc kinase was found in the supernatant after centrifuging at 54,000g for 90 minutes. The enzyme was stable when stored at -20°C but had a half-life of 3 days when stored at 4°C. The presence of either the substrate, GlcNAc, or glycerol stabilized the enzyme. ATP is the preferred phosphoryl donor for the phosphorylation of GlcNAc. CTP, UTP, and GTP gave only 17-30% of the activity obtained with ATP. The pH optimum for the enzyme activity was determined in glycine-NaOH buffers and activity was found to be optimal over the range pH 8.2 to 9.5. The Km values for ATP and GlcNAc determined from direct linear plots (Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden, 1974) were 1.3 and 1.9 mM, respectively. No inhibition of GlcNAc kinase was ob-

DISCUSSION

Kinase Activity in C. albicans The ability of cell-free extracts of C. dbicans to carry out ATP-catalyzed phosphorylation of a number of different compounds was examined (Table 5). The assay procedure was the same as that used for GlcNAc t that the GlcNAc was replaced by a radioactively labeled substrate. With the cell-free extract from cells that had not been exposed to GlcNAc, only glucosamine and 2-deoxyglucose were phosphorylated. With induced cells extensive phosphorylation of GlcNAc, glucosamine, and Zdeoxyglucose occurred. After incubation of cells with GlcNAc the specific activity of the kinase for both glucosamine and 2-deoxyglucose increased two- to threefold; only a small fraction of the 3-O-methylglucose and a-methylglucopyranoside was ~bos~horylated.

GlcNAc induces a yeast-tochange in morphology in (Simonetti et al., 197 1980) and this implies of GlcNAc is important in morphology of C. albicans. of the control mechanism ing of GlcNAc 6-phosph lism and biosynthesis o might be a major step ing GlcNAc-induced dim albicans. The first enzyme of GlcNAc metabolism is and it has been demonstrated ( Singh and Datta, 1978) that this inducible in C. albkans.

rate of product formation on the cellulose paper was proportional to the rate of substrate removal, the ATP used was monitored by the luciferase assay. Excellent correlation was found between the micromoles of radioactive product produced (cellulose paper assay) and the micromoles of ATP utilized (luciferase assay). The established procedure for measuring GlcNAc kinase by assaying the removal of GlcNAc calorimetrically (Datta, 1970) produced large errors. This was because of the small change in concentration at the end of the lo-minute assay. The cellulose paper assay is rapid, sensitive, and accurate. The formation of the two compounds GlcNAc 6phosphate and glucosamine-6-phosphate on paper chromatograms of assay mixtures confirms the presence of GlcNAc kinase and GlcNAc-6-phosphate deacetylase, both enzymes required in the conversion of GlcNAc to fructose 6-phosphate. A low constitutive level of GlcNAc kinase was detected in extracts from blastospores which had not been exposed to GlcNAc (Table 1). This is in contrast to the data of Battacharya et al. (1974), who reported that this enzyme is totally absent from cells grown on glucose. These conflicting results probably reflect the difference in sensitivity of the assay system used since the assay of Battacharya et al. (1974) requires precipitation of the GlcNAc 6phosphate followed by calorimetric estimation of the residual GlcNAc. The time course and the extent of induction for GlcNAc kinase was similar for cells growing as blastospores and cells germinating; the specific activity of the enzyme was found to increase 20- to 30-fold. GlcNAc appears'to be a specific inducer of GlcNAc kinase. Analysis of the kinetic data gave Km values of 1.9 mM for GlcNAc and 1.3 mM for ATP. These compare with the K, values of 1.1 mM (GlcNAc) and 1.8 mM (ATP) for GlcNAc kinase from hog spleen enzyme (Datta, 1970). There was, however, no evidence that the yeast enzyme is allo-

steric; GlcNAc 6-phosphate and UDPGlcNAc at 5 mM are not inhibitors. ADP was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor for GlcNAc with a Ki of 7.1 mM. ManNAc causes some induction of GlcNAc kinase (Table 1) but Singh and Datta (1979) have shown that ManNAc induces the synthesis of ManNAc-2-epimerase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ManNAc to GlcNAc. It is this GlcNAc which presumably triggers the induction of GlcNAc kinase and therefore the induction of GlcNAc kinase in C. albicans in the presence of ManNAc is the result of sequential induction rather than direct induction. Germ-tube formation readily occurs in the presence of glucose plus glutamine in conditioned yeast cells of C. albicans (Shepherd et al., 1980), but GlcNAc kinase was not induced, indicating that glutamine and glucose enter the chitin biosynthetic pathway via a pathway that does not involve nonphosphorylated GlcNAc. The induction of the enzyme, L-glutamine-D-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase, is required for the transfer of the amino group of glutamine to fructose 6-phosphate during the formation of glucosamine 6-phosphate (Chiew et al., 1980). The specific activity of GlcNAc kinase reached a maximum level between 2 and 3 hours and this corresponds to the time that all of the GlcNAc has been removed from the medium (Chiew, unpublished). There is then a decline in the specific activity unless additional GlcNAc is added to the medium. These data indicate that when all the GlcNAc is utilized either enzyme synthesis ceases and/or there is enhanced enzyme degradation. The inhibition of GlcNAc kinase induction by trichodermin and ethidium bromide provides evidence that the increase in the activity of GlcNAc kinase upon addition of GlcNAc is probably due to de nova synthesis requiring both transcription and translation rather than either activation of a zymogen or translation of latent mRNA.

mycin C and hydroxyurea both inhibited thymidine incorporation into growing yeast cells, but had no effect on the induction of GlcNAc kinase. In a previous study (Shepherd et al., 1980) it was demonstrated that the DNA content remained constant over the first 4 hours of germination. These data indicate that DNA synthesis is not required for induction of GlcNAc kinase. Bhattacharya et al. (1974), Biswas et al. (1979), and Singh and Datta (1979) have reported that cycloheximide inhibits the synthesis of GlcNAc kinase in C. albicans 3PO0 (National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India). The concentration of cycloheximide (50 pg/ml) that they used to obtain inhibition with this strain did not affect the induction of GlcNAc kinase in C. albicans (ATCC 10261) and high concentrations of cycloheximide (350 PM) were required to inhibit protein synthesis in this strain (Shepherd el al., 1980). Cysteine did not arrest germ-tube formation nor did it affect GlcNAc kinase induction in this strain of C. albicans although Simonetti et al. (1974) have reported that GlcNAc-induced germtube formation is inhibited by cysteine. The observation that cysteine had no effect on germ-tube formation opposes the concept of morphogenic control by -SH compounds which was postulated by Nickerson and Falcone (1956). Cyclic AMP has been shown to inhibit both RNA and protein syntheses in C. albicans (Bhattacharya and Datta, 1977). With C. albicans ATCC 10261, however cells had to be pretreated with mercaptoethanol before dibutyl cyclic AMP caused inhibition of GlcNAc kinase induction. The inibitory action of nystatin and amphoteriin B on both germ-tube formation and GlcNAc kinase induction was probably due bs altered cell membrane permeability and ibly cell death (Johnson et al., 1978). ased cm the results obtained from these studies it is proposed that the induction of GlcNAc kinase in C. albicans involves classical gene expression with either

GlcNAc or some other mediator as the inducer. Activation of this gene results i synthesis of GlcNAc kinase via the cesses of transcription and translation" The addition of trichodermin prevented c tinued synthesis of the enzyme and level of GlcNAc kinase remaine Further addition of GlcNAc t min-treated cells did not affect activity of the kinase.

2-deoxyglucose was not phosphorylated by the GlcNAc kinase as high concentrations of the sugar analog did not affect the rate of GlcNAc kinase unless ATP became limiting. Cell-free extracts from C. albicans blastospores which had not been exposed to GlcNAc readily phosphorylated 2-deoxyglucose. The increased kinase activity toward 2-deoxyglucose following induction with GlcNAc could reflect either phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose by the induced GlcNAc kinase or an increase in specitic activity of another kinase.
