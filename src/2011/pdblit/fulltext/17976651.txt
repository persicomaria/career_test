INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN INOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE ACCUMULATION IN HUMAN ERYTHROCYTES Erythrocytes from 5% of a normal population accumulated relatively high amounts of radioactive inosine triphosphate (i.e., ~ 70 nmoles/1010 cells in 2 hr) when they were incubated with [14C]hypoxanthine. The incidence of this characteristic in a mentally retarded population was 16%. Inosine triphosphate was synthesized from [14C]hypoxanthine, but not from [14C]adenine or [14C]guanine. The metabolism of [14C]adenine and [14C]guanine was the same in erythrocytes that accumulated "normal" and "high" amounts of inosine triphosphate. Inosine tril~hosphate did not accumulate in leukocytes.

INTRODUCTION VANDERHEIDEN(13} HAS REPORTED that erythrocytes from 7 out of more

than 6000 persons that he studied contained concentrations of inosine triphosphate* (ITF) that were 20- to 25-fold higher than the very low concentrations of I T P that could be detected in most samples of erythrocytes. Other individuals were identified whose erythrocytes contained the normal, very low, concentrations of ITP, b u t which accumulated 2- to 4-fold more ITP when these erythrocytes were incubated with inosine; in contrast, erythrocytes of most individuals did not accumulate significant amounts of ITP when incubated with inosine. The incidence of individuals whose

MATERIALS AND METHODS

[8-14C]Adenine, 40 mCi/mmole, [8-14C]guanine, 40 mCi/mmole, and [SH]6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, 2564 mCi/mmole, were obtained from New England Nuclear Corp., Boston, Mass., and [8-14C]hypoxanthine, 50 mCi/mmole, from Schwartz-Mann Bioehemicals, Orangeburg, N.J. Radioactive hypoxanthine and guanine were purified before use by chromatography on Dowex-50-H ÷. Non-radioactive purine bases, ribonucleosides and ribonucleotides were obtained from Sigma Ohemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. Fischer's medium15 (dry powder with giutamine but without NaHCOa) , was purchased from Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, N.Y. Modified Fischer's medium is made by dissolving one package of dry medium in water, adding NaH2PO 4 to a final concentration of 25 raM, and adjusting the pH to 7.4. Blood was drawn from non-fasting individuals between 8 and 11 a.m. and processed within 3 hours. To prepare erythrocytes, 0~ ml of heparinized whole blood was centrifuged at 1700 x g for 4 rain at room temperature and plasma and buffy coat removed with a Pasteur pipet. Cells were suspended in 5 volumes of 0.9% NaC1 and centrifuged; the supernatant was removed and the washing procedure was repeated. The cells were then suspended again in 0.9% NaC1 and centrifuged at 2300 x g for 10 min at 4 °. A 25% (v/v) suspension was made in modified Fischer's medium and from this a 2.5% ( v / v ) suspension was made using the same medium. Cell number was determined using a Model B Coulter Counter. Eighty ~1 of the final erythrocyte suspension was transferred to plastic tubes (12 x 75 ram, Falcon Plastics, Oxnard, Calif.) and 15 ~1 of modified Fischer's medium and 5 ~1 of [14C]hypoxanthine or other radioactive purine (100 ~M, final concentration) was then added. The tubes were incubated at 37" with shaking at 100 oscillations per

rain in an atmosphere of air for 2 hr. Nucleotide synthesis was linear for this period. All incubations were done in duplicate, and a v e r a g e variation of individual analyses f r o m the mean was less than 5%. In studies with 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, the incubation m i x t u r e contained 80 ~1 of erythrocyte suspension, 15 ."1 of 0.040 mM [ 3 H ] 6-methylmereaptopurine ribonucleoside and 5 ~1 of 2 mM non-radioactive compound; the final concentration of 6-methylmereaptopurine ribonucleoside was ca. 0.1 mM and the specific activity was ca. 154 mCi/mmole. A t the end of the incubation period, 5 ~tl of cold 4.2 M perchloric acid w a s added to each tube and the tube was mixed with a vortex mixer. F i v e ~tl of 4.45 N KO.H w a s then added to neutralize the mixture. A f t e r standing in an ice b a t h for 30 rain, the tube was then centrifuged a t 1700 x g for 4 rain a t room t e m p e r a t u r e to remove acidinsoluble components and KCIO 4. Purine ribonueleotides were separated by one-dimensional thin-layer c h r o m a t o g r a p h y on polyethyleneimine-cellulose on M y l a r sheets (Macherey-Nagel Co. P o l y g r a m eel 300 P E I , B r i n k m a n Instruments, Toronto, Ont.) by a modification the procedure of Crabtree and Henderson(16). A wick of W h a t m a n 3MM p a p e r was stapled to the top of the thin-layer sheet, and sheets were f i r s t developed overnight with 4 M sodium f o r m a t e buffer, p H 3.4, dried, and then developed overnight with methanol: w a t e r (1:1). A f t e r drying, 10 ttl of cell e x t r a c t plus about 20 nmole each of AMP, ADP, ATP, NAD, IMP, XMP, GMP, GDP and G T P as carriers were applied as a 1.5-cm. streak 1.5 cm f r o m the bottom of the sheet, and it was developed overnight with met h a n o l : w a t e r (1:1) to wash salts, purine bases and ribonucleosides onto the p a p e r wick, which was then discarded. Six samples were usually analyzed per sheet. To separate the ribonucieotides, the sheets were developed with increasing concentrations of sodium f o r m a t e buffers, p H 3.4, as follows: 0.5 M f o r m a t e b u f f e r to a line 2.0 cm above the origin, then 2.0 M f o r m a t e b u f f e r to a line 8.0 cm above the origin, and finally 4.0 M f o r m a t e b u f f e r to the top of the plate. A f t e r drying, nucleotide-containing areas were visualized under ultraviolet light. This method has previously(16.17) been used to separate the following nucleotides: GTP, ATP, GDP, ADP, GMP, XMP, IMP, AMP, and N A D (these are listed in order of their migration, with G T P closest to the origin). As discussed f u r t h e r below, it was found in the course of this study t h a t I T P and I D P were also separated by this procedure; I T P m i g r a t e s between G T P and A T P , and I D P m i g r a t e s between GDP and ADP. Ultraviolet-absorbing areas of the c h r o m a t o g r a m s were cut out, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter using a toluene scintillation phosphor solution(16). The same chromatographic procedure was followed when [ 3 H ] 6 - m e t h y l m e r c a p t o purine ribonucleoside was used as substrate. As authentic samples of the di- and triphosphates of this compound were not available as carriers, the c h r o m a t o g r a m s were cut into 1 cm sections, and the radioactivity of each section was measured. Radioactive metabolites were found 2-3 cm, 5-6 cm, and 11-12 cm f r o m the origin. On the basis of expected chromatographic mobilities, these compounds were tentatively identified as the nucleoside triphosphate, diphosphate, and monophosphate, respectively. The ident i t y of the monophosphate was confirmed by comparison with an authentic sample. H i g h - p r e s s u r e liquid c h r o m a t o g r a p h y using a V a r l a n - A e r o g r a p h LCS-1000 chromat o g r a p h was also used t o separate nucieotides in neutralized perchlorie acid extracts, as described by Brown(iS). To measure nucieotide concentrations in fresh blood, 5 ml of whole blood was mixed with 5 ml of cold 4.2 M perchloric acid, immediately a f t e r collection. A f t e r centrifugation the s u p e r n a t a n t w a s neutralized with K O H , and the KC10 4 was removed by centrifugation. Ascorbic acid was added (final concentration: 1 raM) as a stabilizing agent(19), and samples were frozen a t -20 ° until analyzed. Nucleotide concentrations were also measured following incubation of erythrocytes with non-radioactive hypoxanthine. In this case 2 ml of whole blood was added to 40 ml of modified Fischer's medium containing 100 .aM hypoxanthine. A f t e r incubation a t 37"

for 2 hr in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask, the cells were separated by centrifugation, and
extracted with 5 ml of cold 4.2 M perchloric acid. These extracts were then treated as

described above.

RESULTS The accumulation of ITP in occasional samples of human erythrocytes following incubation with [14C]hypoxanthine was first observed in the course of a broader study of individual variation in purine metabolism in human erythrocytes and leukocytes(17). Thus it was found that when the purine ribonucleotides GTP, ATP, GDP, ADP, GMP, XMP', IMP, AMP, and NAD were separated by thin-layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose (see Methods) following incubation of human erythrocytes with [14C]hypoxanthine, radioactivity was sometimes detected in a compound that migrated between GTP and ATP, but which was clearly separated from these nucleotides. In view of Vanderheiden's reports concerning ITP synthesis in human erythrocytes, ITP was chromatographed together with the other purine nucleotides listed above, and it was found to coincide with the radioactivity that chromatographed between GTP' and ATP. Subsequent experiments showed that samples in which relatively large amounts of radioactive ITP had accumulated also contained smaller amounts of radioactivity in a compound that chromatographed with IDP (between GDP and A D P ) . Samples containing the putative radioactive ITP were subjected to thinlayer chromatography on cellulose in two systems that Vanderheiden(l~ had used to separate ITP and IDP from other purine ribonucleotides. Both when 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.8 :ammonium sulfate :l-propanol (100: 60:2, v / w / v ) and isobutyric acid : c o n c N H 4 0 H :water (57:4:39, v / v / v ) were used as solvents, radioactivity was found in ITP (as well as in hypoxanthine and IMP', but not in other compounds), and ITP was clearly separated from other purine ribonucleotides. Another erythrocyte extract containing the putative ITP was chromatographed to separate ITP, the ITP was eluted from the polyethyleneiminecellulose, subjected to mild acid treatment (0.1 N HC1, 25 °, 1 h r ) , and rechromatographed with a mixture of purine ribonucleotides which included ITP and IDP. Ninety-four percent of the radio-activity originally in ITP was now found in IDP and IMP ; the remainder was still in ITP. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the metabolites of [14C]hypoxanthine that were found in occasional samples of human erythrocytes were indeed IT1· and IDP. In the population studies by Vanderheiden, both high concentrations of ITP in erythrocytes and the ability of these cells to accumulate ITP when incubated with inosine appeared to be rareCl-31, although detailed incidence studies were not done in the later case.

urements of ITP accumulation when erythrocytes from 180 individuals in two local populations were incubated with [14C] hypoxanthine. Measureable amounts of radioactive ITP accumulated in all cases. All values are means of duplicate analyses. A value of 8 nmoles of [14C]ITP per 10 lo cells accumulated in 2 hr, which is among the lowest amounts recorded, is equivalent to 85 counts per minute above background; all samples were counted for 4 minutes. On the basis of the distribution of values for [14C]ITP accumulation shown in Fig. 1, a value of 70 nmoles of [14C]ITP per 101° cells accumulated in 2 hr was taken as the upper limit of "normal" values. Erythrocytes which accumulated amounts greater than this are termed " h i g h I T P " cells.

One population that was studied (Fig. 1, romp) consisted of 80 normal individuals. Approximately equal numbers of males and females were included, and ages ranged from 1 to 50 (mean: 27.2) years. No relationship between age or sex and amount of [14C]ITP accumulated was detected, within the "normal" range. Erythrocytes from 4 individuals (5%) studied accumulated more than 70 nmoles/10~o cells in 2 hr, and therefore were "high ITF" cases; these were all males, aged 20-40 (mean: 31) years. No difference was noted between "high ITP" and "low ITP" cases with respect to reticulocyte count or other characteristics of blood smears. The second population that was studied (Fig. 1, bottom) comprised 100 severely mentally retarded persons. Thirty-six females and 64 males were studied, and ages ranged from 9 to 37 (mean: 17) years. Of 79 patients studied in one institution, 71 had no recognized syndrome, injury or biochemical basis for their mental retardation. Diagnoses in the remaining cases included 2 mucopolysaccharidosis, 1 Rubinstein-Tabay, 1 tuberous sclerosis, 2 premature birth, 1 postnatal anoxia and 1 congenital toxoplasmosis. All patients were severely mentally handicapped and were cared for in a special facility created to handle such patients. Nutritional status was judged good to excellent in this group of patients. Among the 23 patients at a second institution, a definitive diagnosis was made in 2 and diagnosis of possible birth injury in a f u r t h e r 3 cases. The two definitely diagnosed cases were tuberous sclerosis and Down's syndrome. The remaining 18 patients had no definitive basis for their mental handicap. No relationship between age or sex and the amount of [14C]ITP accumulated was detected, within the "normal" range. The incidence of "high I T P " dases in the mentally retarded population was 16%. Analyses of the data for the two populations (normal and mentally retarded) by the chi-square test indicated that the difference in incidence of "high ITP" cases between them was highly significant (p < 0.005). There were 5 females and 11 males in this group, approximately the same ratio as in the population as a whole. The incidence of "high ITP" cases was 35 % at one institution and 10 % at the other institution. Although blood samples from the first and second institutions had to be stored at room temperature for approximately 1 and 3 hours respectively, during transportation, control experiments have shown that such storage conditions do not affect the amount of [14C]ITP accumulated. Studies were conducted to determine if "normal" and "high" [14C]ITP accumulation was observed consistently in erythrocytes of the same individuals, or if this was a variable phenon/enon. Table 1 shows that measurements on cells from 4 individuals with "high" and 2 individuals with "normal" ITP accumulation gave consistent results, within the expected limits of experimental variation, when these were repeated at intervals

Further biochemical comparisons of erythrocytes that accumulated "normal" and "high" amounts of [14C]ITP were undertaken. Table 2 shows the extent of conversion of radioactive adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine into purine ribonucleotides in erythrocytes that accumulated "normal" and "high" amounts of [ ~ C ] I T P . These results show that significant amounts" of radioactive ITP were formed only when[14C]hypoxanthine was used a s precursor; the conversion of adenine nucleotides and guanine nucleotides to hypoxanthine nucleotides was therefore equally low in both kinds of cells. In addition, these data show that the metabolism of radioactive adenine and guanine was essentially the same in both types of erythrocytes. Finally, IMP was the major ribonucleotide metabolite of [14C]hypoxanthine even in cells that accumulated "high" amounts of ITP. In such cells, a small amount of radioactivity was also found in IDP; the amounts of radioactivity in IDP in cells with "normal" [~4C] ITF accumulation seldom were significant. Studies were also conducted to measure the total amount of ITP (in contrast just to radioactive ITP) in erythrocytes that accumulated "normal" and "high" amounts of [14C]ITP. These experiments utilized both cells extracted with perchloric acid immediately after collection, and cells that had been incubated for 2 hr with 100 /~M non-radioactive hypoxanthine; details are given in Methods. High-pressure liquid chromatography clearly separated authentic ITP from other nucleotides, and its concentration could be determined by planimetry in comparison with calibrated authentic standards. ITP could not be detected in extracts of freshly collected blood from A J, a "high ITP" individual (see Table 1). However, the concentration of ITP in these erythocytes following incubation with hypoxanthine was 57 nmoles per ml of cells. (ATF concentrations were approximately 1300 nmoles per ml of cells in both cases.) In contrast, ITP could not be detected either in fresh blood or following incubation with hypoxanthine when erythrocytes from JC, a "low ITP" individual (see Table 1) were studied. The sensitivity of the method is such that 9 nmoles of ITP per ml of cells could have been detected. Mixed leukocytes from "high ITP" and "normal ITP" individuals were prepared by the method of Athens, Mauer, Ashenbrucker, Cartwright and WintrobeC2O), and [14CJhypoxanthine metabolism was studied as described above for erythrocytes. Cells from both types of individuals converted approximately 700 nmoles of [l~C]hypoxanthine to acid-soluble nucleotides per 1010 cells per hr, and in both cases the ~mount of radioactivity in ITP w a s approximately 5 nmoles/101 o cells; this is not significantly above background. Previous studies using Ehrlich ascites tumor cells also found that insignificant amounts of ITP accumulated during incubation with [14C]-

hypoxanthine (G. W. Crabtree and J. F. Henderson, unpublished observations). Tatibana and YoshikawaU2), Blair and DulmadgeUSl and Zachara and LewandowskiU4) have reported that ITP accumulated when stored erythr~ cytes were subsequently/ncubated with inosine. In view of the relatively low incidence of '~nigh ITP" cases both in our normal population and particularly in Vanderheiden's studies, the possibility was considered that the capacity of erythrocytos to accumulate ITP at high rates was increased in some w a y by storage. W e therefore measured the conversion of [14C]hypoxanthine to ITP in a number of samples of blood bank blood which had been stored in acid citrate-dextrose. The data in Table 3 show that 3 out of 17 samples (ca. 1 8 % ) studied showed "high" rates of ITP synthesis. Analysis of this result by the chisquare test indicates that this incidence is ~gnificantly greater than the normal incidence of 5 % (p > 0.025 < 0.01). However, if the Yates correction for low sample number is m a d e (2~), the difference in incidence is no longer statistically significant (p > 0.1 < 0.05). Zimmerman, Chu, BuggY, Nelson, Lyon and Elion (22) and Z i m m e r m a n and Chu (2s) have recently reported that the di~ and triphosphates of 6methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside and similar compounds are major metabolites of 6-mercaptopurine in h u m a n erythrocytes, although these

METABOLISM OF 6-METHYLMERCAPTOPURINE

RIBONUCLEOSIDE

"High ITP" and "normal ITP" erythrocytes were incubated in 100 ~I of modified Fischet's rnedium containing 100 ~ [sI-I] 6-methylrnercaptopurine ribonucleoside for 2 hr at 37 °.

compounds have not previously been reported as metabolites either of 6mercaptopurine or of 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside. Because 6methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotide may be considered to be a structural analogue of IMP, the possibility that the detection of 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside di- and triphosphate might be related to the ability of erythrocytes to accumulate "high" amounts of [14C]ITP when incubated with [a4C]hypoxanthine was tested by incubating known "high I T P " and "normal ITP" erythrocytes with radioactive 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside. Table 4 shows that experiments with "high I T P " cells from 5 individuals and "normal I T P " cells from 38 individuals revealed no differences in the accumulation either of the monophosphate or triphosphate of 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside. Attempts to measure the accumulation of [14C]ITF in lysates of "high I T P " Cells incubated with [14C]hypoxanthine, using a variety of conditions, were not successful. DISCUSSION This study confirms the general conclusions of Vanderheiden that eryo throcytes of certain individuals can accumulate higher concentrations of ITP than the norm. The methods used here measure the incidence of the ability of erythrocytes to accumulate ITP to high concentrations when incubated with hypoxanthine; the incidence of this characteristic has not previously been determined. In contrast, Vanderheiden measured the incidence of the presence of measureable amounts of ITP in fresh erythrocytes. Our cursory attempts to measure ITP concentrations in freshly collected erythrocytes would tend to confirm Vanderheiden's conclusion that this characteristic may be more rare than the ability to accumulate high concentrations of ITP during incubation of cells with hypoxanthine. The incidence of "high ITP" individuals was 3-fold higher in the mentally retarded population studied than in the normal population, and within this population, the incidence was different in the two institutions. The

reason for these differences are not-known, and we do not wish to postulate a n y special relationship between high rates of I T P synthesis and mental retardati'0n at the present time. Possible harmful effects of high concentrations of ITI y have not been studied, and this whole matter requires f u r t h e r investigation. The pathway by which I T P i s synthesized from IMP has not yet been definitively identified, although these experiments have ruled out synthesis from adenine or guanine nucleotides. Although the relatively non-specific nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6), can convert IDP to IT1~ ' ' 24), most studies( 2427~ ~""" 2s~, of the nucleoside monophosphate kinases have concluded that these enzymes cannot phosphorylate IMP. However, a recent study (29) Of guanylate kinase ( E C 2.7.4.8) from human erythrocytes showed that it can phosphorylate IMP in addition to GMP, although the K . for IMP is 20-fold higher than t h a t for GMP, and the V,.~ for I M F is 0.2% that for GMP. Furthermore, isozymes of guanylate kinase have been reported to occur in human erythrocytes (3o, 311, and these appear to differ in the rate of phosphorylation of I M P (from 0.4 to 1% the rate of phosphorylation of GMpc3o). However, studies of erythrocytes of over 3 0 0 . individuals(811 found no individual variation in the distribution of guanylate kinase isozymes. The data of Table 2 show t h a t in "high I T P " cells the rate of phosphorylation of I M P is about 15% t h a t of GMP, a result which is difficult to reconcile with the data on guanylate kinase just described. The question of the identity of the enzyme t h a t phosphorylates IM1~ requires f u r t h e r study. Vanderheiden has attributed the presence of I T P in erythrocytes to a relative deficiency of a specific I T P pyrophosphohydrolaseC4-7); this enzyme does not cleave ATP, but hydrolyses GTP at about 10% the rate at which it acts on ITPCg). However, because the enzymes of I T P synthesis have not been unequivocably identified and studied, it is not yet known if I T P pyrophosphohydrolase deficiency can account for all "high I T P " cases. The " I T P pyrophosphohydrolase deficiency" hypothesis also requires t h a t in "normal" erythrocytes I T F is synthesized at relatively high rates but is also continuously broken down at similar rates; however the function such a cycle might have is obscure. In conclusion, small but significant amounts of[14C]ITP have been found to accumulate in fresh human erythrocytes incubated with [14C]hypoxanthine. In erythrocytes from a small number of individuals, greater than "normal" amount of I T P accumulate, although other aspects of purine metabolism are normal. F u r t h e r studies are required to elucidate the inheritance o f the latter trait, the pathway of I T P synthesis, the role of I T P in erythrocytes, possible harmful effects of high concentrations of ITP, and the exact biochemical bases for individual variation in I T P accumulation.
