ABSTRACT: The search for new antiviral drugs that repress HIV viral replication by blocking transactivation of viral RNA transcription has long been advocated as an approach to novel antiviral therapy. However, research in this area has so far failed to yield attractive lead compounds because of the insufficient development of RNA-based medicinal chemistry. One difficulty in efforts to inhibit protein-RNA interactions using small druglike molecules is the large surface areas typically found at these interfaces. To overcome this problem, we sought to identify constrained peptidomimetic inhibitors that would provide potential new drug leads. We previously reported the discovery of a cyclic peptide mimic of the RNAbinding domain of BIV Tat protein based on a designed -hairpin scaffold. We demonstrated that the cyclic peptide bound BIV TAR RNA with an affinity comparable to that of the RNA-binding domain of the Tat protein and inhibited protein binding to the RNA. In this study, we report the structure of the complex of the cyclic peptide bound to BIV TAR RNA determined using heteronuclear NMR methods. The structure reveals a -hairpin conformation in the bound peptide, which adopts an unexpected orientation in the major groove of the RNA opposite those observed for peptides derived from the Tat protein. This structure suggests many ways in which to optimize the compound and enhance its activity and pharmacological potential and represents a further step in the rational design of a new class of HIV-1 virus replication inhibitors based on peptidomimetic chemistry.

Ribonucleic acid (RNA)/protein1 complexes play a central role in the life cycle of many RNA viruses and therefore represent attractive targets to develop new antiviral drugs. Inhibitors of key regulatory steps in the viral life cycle functioning by novel mechanisms would also have more favorable characteristics in regards to the emergence of resistance (1-3). Classical examples of protein-RNA interactions that are essential for viral replication are the Tat proteins and cognate TAR RNAs from the immunodeficiency viruses (4). The virally encoded transactivator proteins (Tat) recognize viral RNA regulatory elements (TAR), recruit a kinase [pTEF-B for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)] to release the RNA polymerase stalled at the TAR RNA site, increase enzyme processivity, and prevent premature termination of transcription (5-9). Disruption of the Tat-TAR interaction would prevent viral replication, because the virus depends on this transactivation activity for mRNA production. Considerable structural knowledge has been generated on this important system using both nuclear

magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography (1019). However, the increase in structural knowledge has not yet led to the development of novel antiviral drugs or even attractive antiviral leads. While many attempts have been made to discover new lead compounds capable of disrupting viral replication by interfering with the Tat-TAR interaction, the specificity and overall activity of the compounds identified have not been sufficient to warrant further pharmacological development. Among the approaches used in the past with some success, including in some cases the demonstration of some antiviral activity, were peptidomimetic chemistry (20-26), as well as small molecule drugs derived either from combinatorial or proprietary libraries or from rational structure-based computational searches (2, 3, 15, 27-38). One reason for the limited activity of inhibitors discovered to date (27, 29) lies in the physical characteristics of the Tat-TAR interface. Protein-RNA interactions form large interfaces, similar in size to those seen in protein-protein complexes. This makes it difficult to disrupt protein-RNA interactions using small molecule inhibitors, as has also been the case for proteinprotein complexes. We hypothesized that peptidomimetic chemistry could provide attractive intermediate molecularweight antagonists of Tat protein function, as demonstrated successfully in programs aimed at discovering new inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (39, 40). To pursue this strategy, we studied first the Tat-TAR interaction from the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). Similar to other lentiviruses such as HIV, BIV transcriptional activation requires the interaction of the BIV Tat protein with its cognate TAR RNA response element (Figure 1A). This

Structure of TAR RNA-Cyclic Peptide Complex

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 37, 2005 12363 here the structure of the complex between the BIV-2 peptidomimetic and BIV TAR RNA, which reveals an unexpected mode of binding of the mimetic in the major groove of the RNA. Isotopically labeled RNA and refinement with residual dipolar coupling (RDC) allowed a structure of very high quality that will guide further synthetic elaboration of this peptidomimetic. MATERIALS AND METHODS RNA Synthesis. BIV TAR RNA samples were made as described previously (26, 43). Briefly, RNA was transcribed in Vitro from DNA oligonucleotide templates with T7 RNA polymerase purified in house. For producing labeled RNA, 13 15 C/ N-enriched NTPs (Silantes) were substituted for unlabeled NTPs. RNA was purified from crude transcriptions (6 mL) by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), electroelution, and concentration by ethanol precipitation. After extensive dialysis into 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5), the RNA was diluted 10-fold, annealed at a dilute concentration by heating briefly to 80 °C and concentrated by lyophilization. The final RNA concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nM. NMR samples for the complex were at concentrations between 600 and 800 µM, except for RDC measurements, where the samples were at 250 µM. For experiments studying nonexchangeable protons, samples were exchanged into D2O via three cycles of dissolution with 99.99% D2O and lyophilization. Samples used to study exchangeable protons were dissolved in buffered 92% H2O/8% D2O. Dry peptide was added to predialyzed TAR RNA in NMR buffer to achieve complex formation. Formation of a 1:1 complex was established by adding RNA and/or peptide in small increments and monitoring the H5/H6 region of TOCSY spectra of the RNA for the expected number of pyrimidine resonances until one single species was observed corresponding to peptide-bound RNA. Peptide Synthesis. The BIV-2 peptide was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified by reverse-phase HPLC, as described previously (26). NMR Spectroscopy. NMR data were collected on Bruker DRX 500 MHz, DMX 600 MHz, and DMX 750 MHz spectrometers equipped with HCN and HCP probes with triple-axis gradients. Data were processed with nmrPipe (44) and visualized with Sparky (45). For 2D 1H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra at 750 MHz, three mixing times (80, 120, and 300 ms) were used; for 3D 13C NOESY-HMQC spectra recorded at 600 MHz, mixing times of 100 and 200 ms were used. 13C frequency spectral widths were set to 24 ppm, and ribose resonances were folded into convenient spectral regions. HCP and HETCOR spectra at 500 MHz were implemented using standard parameters (46, 47) to assign phosphorus atoms and for the determination of backbone torsion angles (see below). Filtered spectra of the "F1fF2f" type were obtained according to published pulse programs (48, 49), except that single purge elements were used to enhance sensitivity. The 2D F1fF2f NOESY spectrum on the bound unlabeled peptide had mixing times of 100 ms, and the F1fF2f TOCSY spectrum employed a 40 ms DIPSY-2 spin lock period (50). Spectral Assignments. Resonance assignments were based on standard NMR methods (51). Briefly, NOESY spectra

system has been studied extensively (41), and structures of the complex between the RNA-binding domain of BIV Tat (Figure 1B) and the cognate TAR RNA are available (17, 42). Thus, unlike the HIV system where the structure of the Tat-TAR complex is still missing, information was available to guide peptidomimetic design. Because BIV is the closest relative to HIV among all lentiviruses, we reasoned that discovery of specific inhibitors of the BIV Tat-TAR interaction would provide useful insights into inhibition of HIV Tat-TAR. Indeed, this hypothesis has been validated by our discovery of potent and specific inhibitors of the HIV Tat-TAR interaction among peptides closely related to the family of peptidometics characterized in the present study (Athanassou et al., data not shown). We recently demonstrated that a mimic of the BIV Tat protein could be obtained from a small library of conformationally restrained cyclic peptides (26). Inclusion of a D-Pro-L-Pro template (Figure 1D) pre-organized this peptide into a -hairpin conformation in aqueous solution: restraining the peptide in a -hairpin conformation strongly favored binding. On the basis of the hypothesis that certain residue contacts might be conserved between the wild-type peptide sequence and successful library hits, we retained several arginines within the library sequences, as well as an isoleucine present within the middle region of the BIV Tat protein. However, we added hydrophobic residues near the D-Pro-L-Pro template to stabilize the -hairpin conformation (26). The best cyclic peptide library member, BIV-2 (Figure 1C), binds to BIV TAR RNA with an affinity (Kd ) 150 nM) comparable to that observed for the RNA-binding domain from the complete protein (Kd ) 50 nM). We report

12364 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 37, 2005 collected on unlabeled samples at 750 MHz were analyzed to generate initial proton assignments. Adenine H2 protons were clearly identified in spectra collected on samples in water and allowed confident assignment of exchangeable protons (51). HCCH-COSY (52) and 3D 13C-NOESYHMQC experiments were used to complete the proton assignments and to assign the carbon resonances. 15N chemical shifts were obtained from 15N-heteronuclear singlequantum correlation (HSQC) and NOESY experiments recorded in water. For the most part, only chemical shifts for RNA residues C8-U16, U19, U20, and G22-G27 and the core peptide-binding region were significantly shifted upon peptide binding. This is consistent with the structure, where the peptide makes very limited contacts above residues U16 and G22 and no contacts at all below residues C8 and G27. The assignment of the peptide resonances in the complex was greatly aided by filtered/edited NOESY experiments (48). Because many of the peptide aliphatic protons resonate in the same region of the NOESY spectrum as ribose resonances, these spectra allowed the discrimination of intraresidue nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) in peptide aliphatics from intermolecular NOEs. The typical -sheet HR to HN (i to i + 1) NOEs facilitated the sequential assignment of the peptide without heteronuclear labeling. Unambiguous observation of HR-HR NOEs would not have been possible without the use of the filtered experiments mentioned above. Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs). The RNA/peptide complex used for RDC measurements (225 µL) was mixed with 83 µL of 56 mg/mL Pf1 phage (53) purchased from ASLA Ltd. (Riga, Latvia) dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate at pH 5.5. The deuterium splitting of this sample was determined to be 12.5 Hz at 300 MHz with no center peak, indicating homogeneous orientation. RDCs were obtained from In-Phase-Anti-Phase (IPAP) HSQC spectra (54) collected at 500 Mz and 25 °C. RDCs were measured in the direct (1H) dimension to take advantage of the enhanced digital resolution. The large carbon spectral widths and differing 13C-13C coupling constants required measuring aromatic and ribose RDCs in separate spectra. Reference couplings were determined in the absence of phage, and the following equation was used, RDC ) Jw/pf1 - Jw/outpf1, where Jw/pf1 is the apparent heteronuclear one-bond 1H/13C coupling measured in the presence of phages and Jw/outpf1 is the onebond 1H/13C coupling measure in the absence of phages. Structure Determination. Structures of the BIV-2/BIV RNA complex were calculated with the Xplor-NIH software package using torsion angle dynamics and simulated annealing (55) from a single extended starting template. A total of 100 structures were calculated without RDCs to check for convergence. At this stage of refinement, there were no NOE violations greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral violations greater than 5° for >50 of the calculated structures. RDCs obtained from well-ordered residues, 4-11, 13-18, and 20-31, were used only at this stage of the refinement. Distance restraints were derived from NOE intensities at 80 and 120 ms mixing times in 2D NOESY spectra recorded at 750 MHz. Restraints for overlapped regions were obtained from the 3D 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectrum recorded at 120 ms mixing time acquired at 600 MHz. Intramolecular peptide distances were obtained from 12C-filtered experiments in

Leeper et al. 100% D2O or 90% H2O. Base-pair planarity and standard hydrogen-bonding restraints were used for unambiguously established base pairs. The U10 to A13/U24 base triple was at first not constrained by hydrogen-bond restraints, but consistent positioning of the base of U10 poised to hydrogen bond to the N7 of A13 verified the hydrogen-bonding pattern for this interaction. Furthermore, the U10 NH has a very clear close NOE contact to A13 H8; in subsequent refinement stages, the base triple was further restrained via hydrogenbonding constraints. Backbone and ribose dihedral angle restraints were determined by qualitative analysis of through-bond experiments (2D TOCSY, 2D COSY, and 3D 13C TOCSY-HSQC) (51). The glycosidic angle of A18 was restrained to the syn conformation (0 ( 90°) based on the presence of a strong H1 to H8 NOE. Sugar puckers were constrained to C3endo (0 ) 6, 1 ) -25°, 2 ) 37°, 3 ) -33°, and 4 ) 17°; (15° for each) for all riboses without appreciable H1-H2 cross-peaks in DQF-COSY and 3D 13C-separated TOCSY spectra. Residues with C2-endo pucker (0 ) -22°, 1 ) 35 ( 10°, 2 ) -35°, 3 ) 22°, and 4 ) 0°; (15°) were U12, U20, A21, and G22, as determined by strong H1-H2 correlations in both spectra. The remaining backbone torsion angles were restrained using established methods (51). Briefly, dihedral angles R and were set to exclude the trans torsion angle for residues with canonical 31P chemical-shift values; was restrained to trans; and  was restrained to g+ for residues with strong 4JH4/P correlations in the 1H/31P HETCOR spectra. The angle was restrained to trans when an H2 to P(i + 1) peak was observed in either HCP or HETCOR spectra. RDCs for well-defined residues (G4-G9, G11, A13-U16, and 21-31) were applied as susceptibility anisotropy (sani) restraints with a harmonic potential well, eliminating the need to determine error values for each RDC individually. The powder pattern-like distribution of RDCs (56) for the BIV TAR RNA in the presence of the cyclic BIV-2 peptide indicated values for the magnitude (Da) and rhombicity (R) close to -16 and 0.6, respectively. The RDC values were then plotted as a function of topological arrangement (57), which revealed a uniform spread in the RDCs over the full RNA. This observation indicated that the TAR RNA in the presence of BIV-2 is significantly more rigid than the free RNA and permitted the use of a single Da and R to refine the structure. Optimal values of Da and R were then determined by a systematic grid search sampling values of Da between -12 and -30 in 1 Hz increments and values of R ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 in 0.05 increments, as described previously (58). The set of structures calculated with Da ) -19 and R ) 0.3 had the lowest sani energy, and thus, those values were used during the final refinement. Structures of the BIV-2 complex were examined in MolMol (59). RESULTS Spectral Analysis and Assignments. The structure of the complex between the BIV-2 cyclic peptide and BIV TAR RNA was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Heteronuclear 13C/15N labeling of TAR RNA allowed nearly complete assignments (Figure 2) and good resolution even for the crowded ribose region, using standard methods (51).

teristic of an antiparallel hairpin was used for the sequential assignment of the peptide. Assignments of the BIV-2 peptide were nonetheless greatly aided by recording 13C-filtered experiments (48) on the complex to distinguish intra- from intermolecular NOE interactions. Three types of filtered experiments were collected: 12C 12-filtered NOESY in 90% H2O/10% D2O, 12C 12-filtered NOESY in 100% D2O, and 12C 12-filtered TOCSY in H2O/10% D2O. The filtered NOESY spectrum recorded in water helped distinguish peptide NH-NH and NH to aliphatic NOEs from peptide NH to RNA amino or ribose NOEs. NOESY data recorded in D2O allowed the unambiguous identification of intramolecular NOEs involving peptide aliphatic resonances, by distinguishing them from NOEs to RNA ribose protons. Side-chain resonances were assigned using the 12C-filtered TOCSY and 12C-filtered NOESY spectra to link side-chain resonances to the backbone assignments. Because of the -hairpin conformation, many side chains had a clear pattern of side-chain NOEs involving residues i and i + 2 within each face of the sheet. A number of NMR spectral properties are consistent with BIV TAR RNA, forming a structure very similar to that reported for its complex with BIV Tat protein (17, 42). The U10 NH is involved in a base triple and has a readily observable NOE to A13's H8; the line widths for base H6 and H5 protons of U12 are very sharp, consistent with the base bulging upon complex formation (Figure 2). Furthermore, a continuous network of base NH-NH NOEs extending through the bulge showed the pattern characteristic of the base triple, with the U24 NH having unusual NOEs to three other imino resonances (Figure 2b). The H3 proton

of G11 is significantly downfield-shifted because of the presence of the neighboring U10 (see the Supporting Information). Additionally, the proton assignments of the TAR/BIV-2 terminal loop (C17-U20) were very similar to those reported for the BIV peptide complex with BIV TAR (see the Supporting Information). When these results are taken together, they strongly suggest that the conformation of bound TAR RNA in the presence of the BIV2 peptidomimetic is very similar to that observed for TAR bound to a minimal RNA-binding peptide from the BIV Tat protein (17, 42). Structure Determination. Intermolecular NOEs between the BIV-2 peptide and TAR RNA were readily observable in 2D (Figure 2) and 3D NOESY spectra. A total of 107 intermolecular NOEs, including 15 NOEs to Arg H 's, were obtained. This number is considerably more than found in one previous study (17) and slightly more than the 102 intermolecular NOEs used in a second study (42) of the structure of the BIV Tat-TAR complex. However, Arg guanidinium NH2's were not observable in our spectra, unlike those in other studies (17, 42). This may be due to the slightly weaker affinity of the BIV-2 complex relative to the wildtype complex, to small variations in the solution conditions between the two studies (e.g., pH), or to different kinetic properties of the two complexes. Furthermore, the chemical synthesis of the cyclic peptide precluded economic incorporation of 13C or 15N labels, so that through-bond couplings via hydrogen bonds to exchange-broadened protons could not be obtained. RDCs for the 13C-labeled RNA in the complex obtained by partial alignment of the complex in pf1 phage (53) and

IPAP-HSQC (54) were critical to obtain a high-quality structure. The 55 13C RDCs that were measured accurately significantly improved the global precision of the RNA structure from 2 Å (all heavy atoms) to 1 Å when RDCs were included (Table 1). The structural accuracy was only minimally improved by RDCs, because the structures of the core bulge region (G9-G11, A13, and U24-C26) with and without RDC refinement are within 0.5 Å of each other (data not shown). Thus, the average structures calculated with and without RDCs were very similar (i.e., no change in accuracy), but the variance in the envelope of their respective ensembles was significantly improved by RDC addition (i.e., improved precision). The structure of the complex was calculated with XplorNIH (55) based on a significant number of restraints per residue (Table 1) that compare favorably with those used for studies of the BIV Tat-TAR complex (17, 42). Of the 100 structures calculated, 23 had no NOE violation greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral violations greater than 5°. On average, these structures only had 4 NOE violations greater than 0.2 Å. Of the 23 structures thus deemed to have converged, the 10 lowest energy structures were selected for presentation as the final ensemble. These top 10 structures superimpose very well (Table 1 and Figure 3) with core residues converging to within 0.8 Å root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) (Figure 4A). The previous NMR structures of the Tat-TAR complex had rmsd values over similar regions of 1.16 Å (42) and 1.49 Å (17), respectively. Structure of the BIV-2 Peptidomimetic BIV TAR Complex. The core structure of this complex (RNA residues 6-11, 13-16, and 21-29 and peptide residues 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 12; Figure 4A) is similar to the structure from which the peptide was designed to mimic the Tat protein but with one very significant difference. The RNA structures only differ by about 1.7 Å over RNA residues 10-13 and 2325, i.e., the base triple region (Figure 4B). However, the D-Pro-L-Pro template is positioned toward the bottom of the binding region (parts A and C of Figure 4), and the type-II turn formed by Gly6 and Lys7 points instead away from the 5 and 3 ends of the RNA and toward the apical loop.

FIGURE 3: Superposition of the 10 structures representing the ensemble of converged structures of the BIV-2 TAR complex. All heavy atoms are shown. Adenines are rendered in black; guanines are rendered in blue; uracyls are rendered in gold; cytosines are rendered in dark red; and the BIV-2 peptide is rendered in bluish green and red (D-Pro-L-Pro template). (a and b) All RNA heavy atoms from the 10 structures are shown with a single view of the peptide derived from the lowest energy structure. (c and d) All 10 peptide structures are shown with the RNA from the lowest energy structure; peptide side chains are only shown for the structurally well-defined residues of the RNA-binding interface and the proline template. The two sets of panels differ by a 90° rotation to highlight the deep penetration of the peptide into the major groove.

This orientation is opposite to what is observed in the Tat protein (Figure 4C), because the D-Pro-L-Pro template was introduced to bridge the gap between the N and C termini of the BIV peptide, and we predicted this orientation would be found where Gly6 and Lys7 lie instead (26). Thus, the BIV-2 peptide binds upside down relative to the orientation observed for the wild-type protein. This inversion pivots around the side chain of Ile10 (corresponding to Ile79 in the Tat-derived peptide) that maintains the contacts to the base triple (Figure 5) that is key to the stabilization of the new TAR conformation observed in the protein complex (17, 42). We took great care to verify that the peptide orientation is correct, and several pieces of data provide unambiguous verification of these results. The Val12 methyl protons have very clear NOEs to the H5 and H6 protons of C8 and U9 in the lower stem; the H and H of Arg8 and Arg9 both have clear NOEs to the ribose protons of U16; and Arg9 H and H have NOEs to the H2 proton of A18.

Leeper et al. another on one face of the hairpin that interact with the same bases. Val12 buries its methyl protons in the major groove near the H5 and H6 protons of C8 and U9 (not shown). Two key Arg residues facing the RNA from the same face of the hairpin make specific contacts to the major groove faces of guanine bases: Arg1 contacts G9 (Figure 5B), and Arg3 contacts G11 (Figure 5C). Because Arg1 and Arg3 guanidinium NH2 protons were not observed, the specific hydrogenbonding mode for these Arg/guanine contacts cannot be unambiguously determined (parts B and C of Figure 5). However, the NOE contacts observed for the H proton of Arg1 and G9 are more consistent with the hydrogen bonds depicted in Figure 5B with the Arg1 H hydrogen bonded to N7 and HH21 hydrogen bonded to O6, rather than hydrogen bonds to the N7 and O6 involving exclusively the NH2's, as often observed in protein-nucleic acid complexes (60). The aliphatic portion of the side chain of Arg5 stretches over U10 and makes a hydrophobic contact with the surface of that residue, completely caging and enclosing it along with I10 (parts D and E of Figure 5). The guanidinium group of Arg5 points directly at the space between G14 and C15, interacting with the nearby U12 phosphate while providing a cation- interaction as well (Figure 5D). Arg8 contacts the tetraloop at the top of the structure stacking directly over A21 and may also contribute binding energy via a cation- interaction with this base. The guanidinium group of Arg9 reaches back to interact with the phosphate between U20 and A21 and likely forms a salt bridge with it (Figure 5F). This contact is highly unexpected, because Arg9 is on the face of the hairpin opposite to that where most of the residues important for the binding interaction are located. Arg11, on the peptide face opposite the RNA-binding surface, has only very limited contacts with the RNA but could assist in binding via electrostatic interactions with the nearby G22 phosphate. The remaining peptide residues (Val2 and Thr4 on the peptide face opposite the RNA, Gly6, and Lys7 in the type-II turn and the D-Pro-L-Pro template) have no significant contacts to the BIV TAR RNA.

DISCUSSION Treatment of HIV-infected patients is increasingly compromised by the development of resistance to existing drugs (61, 62). New drugs are needed with orthogonal mechanisms of action compared to current drug targets. An attractive but unexploited target is the transactivator response element, TAR RNA, and its cognate transactivator protein Tat. Small molecules that disrupt the Tat/TAR interaction very likely will reduce HIV-1 replication rates by interfering with the transcription of viral genes. In the past, several TAR-binding small molecules (2, 3, 27-29, 32, 34, 37) and peptide analogues (20, 22, 23, 25) have been identified. However, these small molecules generally had poor activity and specificity (27, 29). Peptide analogues had in at least one case some antiviral activity in cell-based assays (20) but were unstructured and had poor cell-penetration properties and stability. It proved impossible to develop clear structureactivity relationships or obtain critical structural information that would have allowed improvements in activity and selectivity of these initial leads. We reasoned that, as was the case for protein-protein complexes (39, 40), it might be easier to inhibit these large intermolecular interfaces with

RNA with this cyclic peptide mimetic and with the Tat protein (Figure 5A). Thus, the burial of the hydrophobic Ile10 side chain is probably the major driving force to induce the conformational change in TAR and to direct binding. This is the only contact that is strictly conserved between the two structures. The other contacts described below are similar to interactions observed for the Tat peptide, but because of the peptide orientation, there is no direct correspondence. For example, we observe two arginines on the same strand (Arg1 and Arg3) to interact with G9 and G11 (see below), while in the Tat peptide, it is two arginines across from one

conformationally constrained peptides as opposed to typical small "drug-like" molecules (26). We hypothesized that constrained peptides might provide more attractive peptidomimetic inhibitors of Tat proteins, as well as leads for the development of novel antiviral drugs. Obviously, our target is the HIV Tat-TAR interaction, but there is no detailed structural information on the complex yet to allow for reliable peptidomimetic design. The structure of the BIV TAR RNA bound to a fragment of BIV Tat protein provided an alternative starting point (17, 26, 42). We reasoned that the close similarities in structure and sequence between HIV and BIV Tat and TAR elements would allow us to use the BIV model to identify initial leads for HIV Tat-TAR as well. This hypothesis has been validated by our recent discovery of specific inhibitors of the HIV Tat-TAR interaction among the family of peptidometics characterized in the present project (Athanassou et al., data not shown). We designed -hairpin peptidomimetics by grafting the sequence of the RNA recognition element of BIV Tat onto the hairpin-inducing D-Pro-L-Pro

template (26) but with several modifications (parts b and c of Figure 1). Gly76 in the wild-type peptide was removed to maintain an even number of amino acids on each strand, thereby favoring the formation of a cyclic -hairpin structure. This deletion was expected to switch the -turn conformation from type I to type II, because Lys75 and Gly76 that formed the turn in the Tat peptide were substituted with Gly6 and Lys7 (analogous to Gly74 and Lys75) in our library. Amino acids between Thr4 and Ile10 (analogous to Thr74 to Ile79 in the Tat-derived peptide) were kept the same as found in the BIV Tat protein. However, positions 1-3, 11, and 12 (analogous to positions 68-70, 80, and 81 in Tat) were varied during the library synthesis to search for variants that would stabilize the -hairpin structure. When a very small eight-member peptide library was screened, we demonstrated a strong correlation between formation of the -hairpin mimetic structure and the ability to bind to BIV TAR RNA tightly. The best inhibitor, BIV-2, bound to BIV TAR RNA with affinity comparable to the BIV Tat protein (Kd  150 nM) (26). To probe how the peptide binds RNA and guides

12370 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 37, 2005 further synthetic optimization of this compound, we determined the structure of the peptidomimetic-RNA complex by NMR. BIV Tat-TAR is a classical example of recognition by induced fit, with the peptide becoming structured and the RNA changing conformation significantly upon binding (63). BIV-2 was designed to mimic Tat protein, which forms a -hairpin structure only when bound to TAR. BIV-2 was shown to form a stable -hairpin structure in aqueous solution (26). BIV-2 induces a conformational change in TAR, leading to a structure very similar to that of Tat-bound TAR RNA. Although BIV-2 binds to BIV TAR in an orientation that is flipped upside down compared to BIV Tat (Figure 4C), it retains key intermolecular contacts that direct the RNA conformational change. The Arg1, Arg3, Arg5, Ile10, and Val12 side chains were found to make the most extensive interactions with TAR. The side chains of these residues are all located on the upper face of the hairpin, which provides a pre-organized scaffold to direct molecular recognition. Ile10, positioned in the middle of BIV-2, stabilizes the base triple by interacting with A13 and U24, as observed for Ile79 in the BIV Tat protein complex (Figure 5a). Arg5 was found to stack over U10 and to interact with G14 probably by forming a cation- interaction (parts d and e of Figure 5). Arg1 and Arg3 hydrogen bond to G9 and G11, and Val12 makes clear contacts to the H5/H6 faces of two pyrimidines, U7 and C8, and contributes to binding through these interactions. It was most fortuitous that this combination of residues, in positions 1-3, 11, and 12, were incorporated into one member of the small library of mimetics from which BIV-2 was isolated (26). In the previous paper, we reported that the BIV-2 TAR interaction is specific in the sense that formation of a hairpin is required for binding and even single amino acid substitutions caused relatively large changes in affinity (26). The structure of the complex illustrates how specificity in the BIV-2 TAR interaction is achieved by constraining the peptide and by positioning key functional groups at the interface with TAR RNA. Prestructuring the peptide reduces entropic costs upon binding and provides two key hydrophobic (Ile10 and Val12) interactions. Furthermore, hydrogenbonding groups in Arg1 and Arg3 and the cation- interactions formed by Arg5 and Arg8 are achieved by the correct localization of these side chains relative to the RNA in its bound form. This way, the BIV-2 peptide already binds with affinity comparable to the RNA-binding domain of the Tat protein, although side-chain contacts remain to be further optimized. The structure of BIV-2-TAR RNA complex clearly identifies positions that could tolerate structural changes without the substantial loss of binding affinity. First of all, all residues important for binding are on the upper surface of the peptide, while the side chains located in the lower face of the peptide are not significantly involved in TAR recognition. Guanidinium groups are required at positions 1, 3, and 5, while positions 10 and 12 should be occupied by hydrophobic residues. Thus, positions 1, 3, and 5 could be used to design functionality, i.e., cationic hydrogenbonding donors, around the guanidinium group to increase affinity, while a variety of hydrophobic functionalities could be introduced at positions 10 and 12 to optimize intermolecular contacts. In contrast, Arg residues at positions 9 and

Leeper et al. 11 (important for BIV Tat binding to TAR) are not involved in BIV-2 binding to TAR and could be substituted to reduce the overall charge of the peptidomimetic. The partitioning of recognition characteristics could also be exploited to improve the pharmaceutical potential of this compound. The introduction of aliphatic and hydrophobic residues at positions 2, 4, 9, and 11 (on the lower face of the peptide) could increase the bioavailability of the ligand and its ability to penetrate cellular membranes. In ongoing work, a new generation of peptidomimetics has been designed on the basis of these structural data and will be tested to identify more potent variants of BIV-2. In addition to proving that peptidomimetic chemistry could provide highly selective and potent inhibitors of key viral protein-RNA interactions, these second generation compounds will be used to search for inhibitors of the HIV TatTAR interaction based on the similarities between the two structures.
