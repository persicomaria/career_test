At the first glance CK2, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase CK2, is a rigid molecule: in contrast to many eukaryotic protein kinases in CK2 the canonical regulatory key elements like the activation segment occur exclusively in their typical active conformations. This observation fits well to the constitutive activity of the enzyme, meaning, its independence from phosphorylation or other characteristic control factors. Most CK2 structures are based on the enzyme from Zea mays, supplemented by an increasing number of human CK2 structures. In the latter a surprising plasticity of important ATP-binding elements ­ the interdomain hinge region and the glycine-rich loop ­ was discovered. In fully active CK2 the hinge region is open and does not anchor the ATP ribose, but alternatively it can adopt a closed conformation, form hydrogen bonds to the ribose moiety and thus retract the -phospho group from its functional position. In addition to this partially inactive state human CK2 was recently found in a fully inactive conformation. It is incompatible with ATPbinding due to a combination of a closed hinge and a collapse of the glycine-rich loop into the ATP cavity. These conformational transitions are apparently correlated with the occupation state of a remote docking site located at the interface to the non-catalytic subunit CK2: if CK2 blocks this site, the fully active conformation of CK2 is stabilized, while the binding of certain small molecule seems to favour the partially and fully inactive states. This observation may be exploited to design effective and selective CK2 inhibitors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction To date about 40 crystal structures of protein kinase CK2 [1], of its catalytic subunit CK2 ­ a member of the CMGC family of eukaryotic protein kinases (EPK) ­ and of its non-catalytic subunit CK2 have been deposited in the Protein Data Base (PDB) [2]. These structures establish a profound basis for the rational design of effective CK2 inhibitors [3], and they allow the rationalization of many unique features of the enzyme, among them its dual-cosubstrate specificity [4], its acidophilic substrate specificity [5] and its unique heterotetrameric quaternary structure [6]. However, with respect to activity control the message of the CK2related structures is ambiguous: on the one hand in all CK2 chains presently in the PDB the canonical key elements of EPK activation ­ the activation segment and the helix C ­ occur in a conformation typical for active EPKs [7] (Fig. 1A). This conformation is intramolecularly constrained, first and foremost by a close contact of those regulatory key elements to the N-terminal segment (blue region in Fig. 1A) which thus functionally mimics the cyclin proteins in the case of cyclindependent protein kinases [8]. This observation is fully consistent with

the enzyme's constitutive activity, i.e., its independence of external stimuli like phosphorylation or second messenger binding. On the other hand in a recent crystal structure of a human CK2 construct (hsCK21­335) [9] the enzyme adopts an inactive conformation in which two flanking regions of the ATP-binding site ­ the interdomain hinge/helix D region and the glycine-rich loop ­ touch each other in the ATP cavity so that the nucleotide is excluded from binding. We will review here the conformational plasticity of human CK2 around the ATP-binding site. In particular we will show that human CK2 can also adopt intermediate states between the fully active and the inactive conformation. Finally we will discuss factors that may be relevant for the transition between the various states and thus for CK2 regulation. 2. Maize CK2/AMPPNP/Mg2+: a functional reference structure In a recent review about CK2 structures [1] we raised the structure of maize CK2 (zmCK2) in complex with the ATP-analogue adenosine 5-(,-imido)-triphosphate (AMPPNP) and two magnesium ions (PDB code 1LP4 [4,10]) to the status of a functional reference structure. The central argument for this ranking was the fact that 1LP4 is the only CK2/CK2 structure to combine a high resolution with the fact that all functional (catalytic and regulatory) key elements ­ the catalytic loop, the magnesium binding loop, the

replacement is prohibited if the ribose is anchored by a side chain from the hinge region like it is the case in CAPK (Glu127 in Fig. 1C and D); vice versa the shift and thus GTP-binding is supported if ­ like in CK2 with an open hinge so that the anchor candidate Asp120 is significantly far away from the ribose moiety (Fig. 1C and D) ­ enough space is available. Taken together, the dual-cosubstrate specificity provides a clear indication that the fully active state of CK2 is associated with an open conformation of the hinge region. 4. Increased flexibility of the hinge/helix D region in human CK2 In all subsequent structures of maize CK2 ­ the majority of them being complex structures with ATP-competitive inhibitors [1,3] ­ the open conformation of the hinge/helix D region was preserved. In some cases the large "hydrophobic region II" was even systematically exploited and addressed by chemical moieties attached to certain lead structures. An example, the ATP-competitive inhibitor 2-(4-ethylpiperazin-1-yl)-4-(phenylamino) pyrazolo[1,5-a] [1,3,5] triazine-8carbonitrile present in PDB file 2PVL [15], was drawn with blue bonds in Fig. 3A. Yet, the first structure of human CK2 [16] provided evidence that the hinge region might be more flexible in the human enzyme than in maize CK2 (Fig. 2). Although in this structure the backbone trace of that region is similar to maize CK2, it is characterized by much higher temperature factors (Fig. 2B) and by a number of side chains uncovered by electron density. 5. A closed hinge conformation in a double point mutant of human CK2 A principal novel picture of the CK2 hinge region was provided for the first time by the structure of the mutant hsCK21­335Val66Ala/ Met163Leu [10]. This mutant was designed and characterized in an effort to further explore the structural bases of dual-cosubstrate specificity. The rationale behind the mutagenesis was the idea to change the inclination of the cosubstrate's purine base via its flanking side chains and to reduce in this way the adaptability of the ATP site towards GTP with its different hydrogen-bonding potential. While this expectation was met ­ in contrast to the wild-type enzyme the mutant hsCK21­335Val66Ala/Met163Leu has a clear preference for ATP [10] ­ the structure determination surprisingly revealed a novel conformation of the hinge region (Fig. 3A). Like the aforementioned open conformation (Fig. 1D) this structural state is well defined by electron density ­ even yet better after re-refinement (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1) ­ and again different to what is found in CAPK (compare yellow and magenta coil in Fig. 3A). We refer to it as a "closed" conformation since in contrast to the open one the enzyme itself penetrates the hydrophobic region II of the ATP site [13] (Fig. 3A).

cosubstrate analog, the glycine-rich loop and the activation segment ­ are both well defined by electron density and coincide with the equivalent functional elements in a ternary complex structure of CAPK, ATP/Mn2+ and a substrate inhibitor [11] (Fig. 1B). In particular the (,-imido)-triphospho group and the two Mg2+ ions are almost exactly at equivalent positions as ATP and Mn2+ in the CAPK-case (black bonds in Fig. 1B). 3. The functional reference structure contains an open interdomain hinge region In the context of this study it is further important that in the functional reference the region of the interdomain hinge and the helix D (called briefly "hinge region" from here on) are also well defined (blue electron density in Fig. 1B) and characterized with low temperature factors (Fig. 2A). Already in the first structure of maize CK2 [12] it had been noted that this region has an unusual conformation compared to some protein kinase structures known at that time (Fig. 1D). We classify this conformation as "open" because it leaves rather much space in a region that was referred to as "hydrophobic region II" in the established pharmacophore model of eukaryotic protein kinases [13]. The open hinge conformation fits well to the dual-cosubstrate specificity of CK2, i.e., the enzyme's ability to use GTP besides ATP as a cosubstrate. This feature ­ discovered already in the 1960s [14] ­ was structurally rationalized by co-crystal structures of zmCK2 with adenosine- and guanosine 5-(,-imido)-triphosphate (AMPPNP/ GMPPNP) [4] which made clear that the binding of GMPPNP (compared to that of AMPPNP) requires a shift of the purine base and the ribose moiety in the direction of the solvent (Fig. 1C). This

For rerefinement we processed the original diffraction data again in a space group of lower symmetry (P43 which is a sub-group of the original space group P43212) using XDS [37]. In the enlarged crystallographic asymmetric unit two protomers were identified with MOLREP [38]. The refinement was performed with COOT [32] and REFMAC [39] in which the TWIN option was activated. The final R-factors of the refinement were 15.7% (Rwork) and 21.8% (Rfree). Some statistical data about this re-processing and re-refinement work are given in the Supplementary Table 1. The improvement of the electron density in two regions (among them functionally important imido-triphospho group of AMPPNP) is exemplarily documented in Supplementary Fig. 1. The resulting re-refined structure was submitted to the PDB and is available under the accession code 3JUH which substitutes the previous entry 3BW5. (A) Open and closed hinge region in CK2. The open conformation is represented by zmCK2 (black) [10], the closed one by the structures of hsCK21­335/Val66Ala/Met163Leu [10] (yellow) and the hsCK21­335/DRB complex [19] (green). To illustrate that both hinge conformations of CK2 deviate significantly from the hinge in CAPK [11] the latter was drawn in magenta colour. The hydrophobic region II of the protein kinase pharmacophore model of Traxler and Furet [13] was indicated by an ellipse.

The relevant section of the hsCK21­335/Val66Ala/Met163Leu structure is covered by the final electron density (cutoff level 1  above the mean).

The parts (A), (B) and (D) of this figure were prepared with BOBSCRIPT [33] and Raster3D [34], and the part (C) with BRAGI [35].

Fig. 3A (compare yellow and black coil) illustrates the large differences between the two principal conformations of the hinge region of CK2. In its closed conformation the hinge gets into hydrogenbonding contact to one of the canonical secondary structure elements, namely, the small antiparallel -sheet formed by the strands 7 and 8 (Fig. 1A; Fig. 3B). This enlargement of the -sheet is only possible because Phe121, the final residue of the newly established third strand (Fig. 3B), can efficiently bury its aromatic side chain: in the closed hinge conformation this side chain points to a hydrophobic pocket at the inner core of the enzyme while it nestles to a surface patch in the open one (Fig. 3C). This feature resembles the flip of the central phenylalanine of the canonical DFG-motif when the magnesium binding loop switches from the active "DFG-in"-conformation one of the inactive "DFG-out"-conformations observed in MAP kinases [17,18]. 6. The closed hinge conformation is correlated with non-productive cosubstrate binding Since the hinge region is crucial for ATP-binding, it makes sense to ask for the consequences of the closed conformation for ATP binding. The hsCK21­335Val66Ala/Met163Leu structure [10] provides a reliable basis to answer this question because it contains bound AMPPNP which is well covered by electron density over the whole range of the molecule after re-refinement (Fig. 3D). A superimposition of the hsCK21­335Val66Ala/Met163Leu­AMPPNP complex on the functional reference structure (Fig. 3A) reveals (as expected since this was intended by the mutagenesis [10]) a difference in the inclination of the adenine base as a consequence of the exchange of the flanking side chains. More relevant in the context of this article is the observation that the ribose has approached the hinge region and forms several hydrogen bonds to Asn118 and to Asp120 (Fig. 3D). This ribose anchoring retracts the complete (imido)-triphospho moiety and in particular of the -phospho group from their functional positions. For instance the -phospho group which is coordinated by Lys68 in the functional case (Fig. 1B) is now hydrogen bonded by His160 which for this purpose has adopted a different side chain rotamere. 7. The closed hinge conformation and the Asn118-ribose contact are no artefacts of the mutagenesis Although the two mutated residues 66 and 163 are not located in the hinge region, it could not be excluded a priori that the closed hinge conformation was an indirect consequence and thus an artefact of the mutagenesis. In fact, Yde et al. [10] discussed that the open conformation might be stabilized by a special interaction between the amide moiety of the hinge member Asn118 and the sulfur of Met163 and that, vice versa, the loss of this interaction as a consequence of the Met163Leu exchange might have supported the closed conformation. This notion, however, was ruled out by the complex structures of hsCK21­335 with the ATP-competitive inhibitors 5,6-dichloro-1-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole (DRB) [19] and emodin [20] in which the closed hinge conformation was found without those mutations (compare green and yellow coil in Fig. 3A). The hsCK21­335/DRB case is particularly instructive for this review since DRB like ATP contains a ribose moiety. An overlay on the functional reference case reveals that, like in the case of AMPPNP in complex with hsCK21­335Val66Ala/Met163Leu, the ribose is attached to the hinge and far from its functional position (green ligand in Fig. 3A). In summary we can state (i) the closed conformation is a second structural option of the hinge/helix D region of CK2, (ii) it occurred so far exclusively in human (and rat [21]) CK2 and (iii) it is

compatible with ATP binding but only in a non-productive way. Thus, we define a CK2 structure with a closed hinge region as a "partially inactive" conformation of the enzyme. 8. Small molecule ligands in a remote cavity of CK2 at the interface to CK2 The complex structures of hsCK21­335Val66Ala/Met163Leu with AMPPNP [10] and hsCK21­335 with DRB [19] are easily comprehensible concerning the ATP site. They unambiguously reveal how the hinge in its closed conformation retracts the ribose moiety of the nucleotide from the canonical and functional "ribose pocket" [13]. Yet, two further conspicuous features of the two structures, illustrated in Fig. 4A for the instance of the hsCK21­335Val66Ala/ Met163Leu­AMPPNP complex, are less clear with respect to their functional significance: (i) In both cases crystallographic dimers are formed. Although the interface between the subunits of those dimers (Fig. 4A) is with about 1300 Å2 relatively large, there is no indication so far that they can exist in solution or even in vivo. In crystals of hsCK21­335/emodin complexes [20] the closed hinge conformation occurs without these dimers; hence, dimerization is no necessary condition for the existence of the partially inactive conformation of CK2. (ii) Further a small molecule ligand occupies a cavity that is "remote" from the ATP site. The remote cavity was recognized for the first time with the hsCK21­335/DRB complex where it is occupied by a second DRB molecule [19] (Fig. 4B). In the case of the hsCK21­335Val66Ala/Met163Leu­AMPPNP complex it is filled with glycerol (Fig. 4A). The pocket is formed at the Nterminal domain by the outer and mainly hydrophobic surface of the central -sheet and by the 45-loop that adopts a closed conformation in which it is bent towards the -sheet surface (Fig. 4B). The occupation of the remote cavity with two quite different molecules, glycerol and DRB, demonstrates its relatively unspecific character which raises the question how relevant this discovery is. In fact it is the combination with two further observations which confines the region a functional significance: (i) The remote cavity fully overlaps with the CK2/CK2 interface as observed in the CK2 holoenzyme structure [6] (Fig. 4A). For CK2 coordination, however, the 45-loop requires an open conformation (thin black C-trace in Fig. 4B). Therefore, we refer to the region as "remote docking site" which can be adapted via the 45-loop to form either a pocket for small molecules (the "remote cavity") or a more shallow interface for CK2. In any case binding of either CK2 or of small molecules to this remote docking site is mutually exclusive. The affinity of glycerol and DRB to the remote cavity is not sufficient to disturb efficiently the CK2/CK2 interaction which has a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range according to micro-calorimetric [22] and plasmon resonance determinations [23]. Nevertheless the two molecules can be regarded as leads or at least fragments on the way to develop efficient CK2 antagonists. That there is indeed a potential to interfere with the CK2/CK2 interaction with small molecules was demonstrated by Laudet et al. [24]. (ii) Both for DRB [19] and for the most effective CK2 antagonist discovered by Laudet et al. [24] a non-ATP-competitive inhibitory effect on isolated CK2 was described. Laudet et al. [24] even showed that this inhibitory effect can be overcome by CK2. In other words, most likely this substance (a complex structure with CK2 does not exist so far) binds to the remote

docking site and simultaneously has an inhibitory impact on the active site. 9. An inactive structure of CK2 with glycerol in the remote cavity The identification of small molecules that combine the potentials to compete with CK2 and to inhibit CK2 in a non-ATP-competitive

manner fits to a structural discovery that was made recently when glycerol was added as a potential ligand to crystallization experiments with hsCK21­335 [9]: in the resulting structure (PDB 3FWQ) the ATP site was free from an AMPPNP ligand although AMPPNP had been present in the crystallization drop. The structural reason for the exclusion of AMPPNP is illustrated in Fig. 5: not only the hinge region adopts a closed conformation,

moreover the glycine-rich loop collapsed into the ATP site. There both structural elements that normally guarantee correct ATP binding touch each other and prevent access to the site. This becomes most obvious by a look at Arg47 (Fig. 5): this side chain loops down to the C-terminal domain. It forms salt bridges and hydrogen bonds either to Asp120 and His160 in one of the monomers (again a dimer as shown in Fig. 4A is formed) or to the canonical magnesium binding aspartate Asp175 in the other (not illustrated). These structural observations combined with the aforementioned inhibitory effect of a CK2 antagonist [24] support the notion that the inactive conformation of human CK2 is in some way correlated to the occupation of the remote cavity by certain small molecules. "Correlation" means that a direct cause-and-effect relationship is not necessarily required: as shown recently in the case of ubiquitin [25], ligands can select and stabilize certain pre-formed protein conformations, even if no induced-fit occurs [26]. Thus, it is possible that the occupation of the remote cavity by certain small molecules has a stabilizing effect on the inactive conformation even if it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for its formation. The identification of further ligands with such a stabilizing impact on the inactive conformation is an attractive task in the future. 10. In the CK2 holoenzyme CK2 stabilizes the fully active conformation of CK2 If the last conclusion ­ that the occupation of the remote docking site (in its cavity version) by certain small molecules is correlated with the structural and functional state of the ATP site ­ is true, it makes sense to look at the ATP site in the CK2 holoenzyme, i.e., in a state in which the remote docking site is open and used for CK2 binding. The CK2 holoenzyme contains two CK2 chains only one of which has an AMPPNP molecule coordinated in the ATP cavity in the published structure [6] (Fig. 6A). A superimposition of this CK2 subunit on the functional reference structure (Fig. 1A and B) shows their similarity (Fig. 6B): in the holoenzyme CK2 adopts an open hinge conformation; accordingly the AMPPNP molecule is free from ribose anchoring and as a consequence the -phospho group is coarsely at its productive position (Fig. 6B). The open hinge conformation is also found in the second, AMPPNP-free, CK2 chain of the holoenzyme (not illustrated). This demonstrates that the presence of the cosubstrate is not required to induce the open hinge conformation. Rather the fully active state of human CK2 is pre-formed as soon as the critical factor CK2 has been bound. 11. Conclusions The structural interpretation we developed in this review is summarized in Fig. 7: we postulate for CK2 a conformational equilibrium between three functionally different states. The structural knowledge presently available strongly supports the view that for maize CK2 the equilibrium lies predominantly on the side of the fully active conformation irrespective of any ligands. Human CK2, however, is conformationally more flexible. To keep human CK2 fully active, in particular in the overcrowded molecular environment of a cell, it is necessary to integrate it in the holoenzyme complex with CK2. In this sense CK2 is in fact a "regulatory subunit," a factor that can withdraw fully active CK2 from the conformational equilibrium and thus quickly shift CK2 to a fully active state. The importance of this effect is indicated not only by the high affinity between CK2 and CK2 [22,23] but also by the observation that it is kept stable over a certain temperature and pH range [27]. On the other hand, there are good reasons to assume that CK2free populations of CK2 in human cells as they have been detected [28] are not necessarily fully active. Rather there may be small metabolites stabilizing inactive conformations of CK2 as illustrated

in Fig. 7. Full CK2 activity can be readily established from such populations as indicated above, i.e., by CK2. What follows for strategies to develop CK2 inhibitors? For the design of classical ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitors that target the CK2 holoenzyme (the main source of endogenous CK2 activity [29]) maize CK2 is established as enzyme matrix for co-crystallization [3]. Our analysis, in particular the conformational similarity between maize CK2 and human CK2 if bound to CK2 (Fig. 6B), shows that this is a reasonable choice because it avoids a problem with the CK2 holoenzyme, namely, the difficulty to grow well-diffracting protein crystals. Recent developments, however, in particular the discovery of the remote cavity (Fig. 4A and B) [19], non-ATP-competitive inhibitors [24] and inactive human CK2 conformations [9] suggest to follow

additionally "jumping-out-of-the-box" strategies of inhibitor design. Such strategies depend on subtle conformational effects observed so far only with human CK2 which therefore is more suitable in this context than the maize homologue. In the moment, where CK2 is only beginning to become a pharmaceutically interesting target enzyme [30], it is definitely worth to follow both approaches.
