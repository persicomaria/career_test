Mature lung surfactant protein C (SP-C) corresponds to residues 24­58 of the 21 kDa proSP-C. A late processing intermediate, SP-Ci, corresponding to residues 12­58 of proSP-C, lacks the surface activity of SP-C, and the SP-Ci a-helical structure does not unfold in contrast to the metastable nature of the SP-C helix. The NMR structure of an analogue of SP-Ci, SP-Ci(1­31), with two palmitoylCys replaced by Phe and four Val replaced by Leu, in dodecylphosphocholine micelles and in ethanol shows that its a-helix vs. that of SP-C is extended N-terminally. The Arg-Phe part in SP-Ci that is cleaved to generate SP-C is localized in a turn structure, which is followed by a short segment in extended conformation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of SP-Ci(1­31) in microsomal or surfactant lipids shows a mixture of helical and extended conformation at pH 6, and a shift to more unordered structure at pH 5. Replacement of the N-terminal hexapeptide segment SPPDYS (known to constitute a signal in intracellular targeting) of SP-Ci with AAAAAA results in a peptide that is mainly unstructured, independent of pH, in microsomal and surfactant lipids. Addition of a synthetic dodecapeptide, corresponding to the propeptide part of SP-Ci, to mature SP-C results in slower aggregation kinetics and altered amyloid fibril formation, and reduces the surface activity of phospholipid-bound SP-C. These data suggest that the propeptide part of SP-Ci prevents unfolding by locking the N-terminal part of the helix, and that acidic pH results in structural disordering of the region that is proteolytically cleaved to generate SP-C.

Pulmonary surfactant is a lipid / protein mixture that reduces surface tension and exerts host defence functions at the alveolar air / liquid interface. Surfactant contains mainly phospholipids but also cholesterol and small amounts of fatty acids. Four surfactant-associated proteins, surfactant protein A (SP-A), SP-B, SP-C and SP-D, have been described [1,2]. It is generally

accepted that the hydrophobic SP-B and SP-C are primarily involved in the reduction of alveolar surface tension [1­3], while the hydrophilic SP-A and SP-D are involved in pulmonary innate host defence [4­6]. SP-C is a 35-residue transmembrane lipopeptide uniquely expressed in the alveolar type II cell [7]. The function of SP-C in vivo remains unclear, but effects of

Properties of SP-C N-terminal propeptide

SP-C on the adsorption, spreading, and stability of lipid films at an air / water interface have been documented in a number of in vitro studies. In addition, it has been shown recently that SP-C can recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [8]. The SP-C primary and secondary structures of different species are highly conserved. SP-C is composed of a flexible N-terminal end, where two palmitoyl groups are linked to cysteine residues at positions 5 and 6, and an a-helical C-terminal part [9,10]. The SP-C a-helix is metastable and can irreversibly transform into b-sheet aggregates, forming amyloid fibrils under pathological conditions, or during incubation in aqueous organic solvents [11­15]. Removal of the SP-C palmitoyl groups accelerates aggregation [16]. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying SP-C fibril formation are not clear. The SP-C helix contains a polyvaline segment (containing 10­12 valine residues out of 16) which is intriguing since valine has the highest b-strand propensity of all residues. This feature likely underlies the tendency of SP-C to unfold and aggregate, since replacement of valine with leucine (which favours helix formation) results in a stable a-helix [17,18]. Mature SP-C corresponds to residues 24­58 of the 197-residue integral membrane protein proSP-C, and is generated via multiple proteolytic cleavages [19]. The final cleavage of proSP-C to SP-C likely occurs in the lysosome-like lamellar bodies in which surfactant lipids and proteins are packed together, and from which they are secreted by exocytosis into the alveolar space [20,21]. ProSP-C has a type II orientation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), exposing the N-terminal part to the cytosol and the C-terminal part to the ER lumen. The correct intracellular trafficking of proSP-C has been reported to depend on the N-terminal propeptide. Deletion of the region from residues Met10 to Thr18 of proSP-C results in retention of the peptide in the ER [21,22]. In contrast, truncation mutants of proSP-C, which lack the C-terminal propart, are directed to distal compartments in transfected epithelial cells [22]. Infants with inherited deficiency of SP-B show neonatal respiratory distress, which is refractory to treatment with exogenous surfactant, and the only effective treatment is lung transplantation [23­25]. In addition, poorly formed lamellar bodies and accumulation of an SP-C precursor are observed in SP-B deficiency [26,27]. This processing intermediate, SP-Ci, shares immunoreactivity with SP-C and was recently found to contain an N-terminal dodecapeptide extension (corresponding to proSP-C residues 12­23), but is otherwise identical to mature SP-C [28]. The presence of the N-terminal dodecapeptide in SP-Ci results in strong inhibition of

both surface activity and LPS binding. This, in combination with the almost complete absence of mature SP-C, suggests that SP-B-deficient children lack active forms of both SP-B and SP-C [28]. The presence of the dodecapeptide propeptide part in SP-Ci also prevents the a-helix from unfolding in neutral aqueous organic solvents for at least 1 month, while in acidified solvents SP-Ci aggregates and forms amyloid-like fibrils in a few days [29]. This suggests that pH affects the conformation of SP-Ci, which is intriguing as the pH is neutral in the early secretory pathway, while the pH of lamellar bodies is 5.5­6 [30]. In the present work we further investigated the structure of SP-Ci and how the dodecapeptide N-terminal flanking peptide affects SP-C stability and activity.

Results
NMR structure of SP-Ci(1­31) in DPC micelles Due to the rare occurrence of SP-B deficiency, it is difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of SP-Ci for NMR analysis. Therefore, SP-Ci(1­31) (Table 1) was synthesized for structural studies. Sequence-specific 1H-NMR assignments of SP-Ci(1­31) incorporated in [2H38]dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles were obtained using a series of NOESY, TOCSY and COSY spectra. All spin systems could be assigned and the chemical shifts are given in supplementary Table S1. 1H-NMR assignments of SP-Ci(1­31) dissolved in ethanol were also obtained (supplementary Table S2). The chemical shifts of SP-Ci(1­31) in the two solvent systems are similar, the Ha shifts differ by <0.08 p.p.m. For definition of the structure of SP-Ci(1­31) in DPC micelles, a set of 263 nonredundant NOE-derived upper distance limits and 81 dihedral angle restraints were used for structure calculations using the program dyana, followed by energy minimization in vacuo with the program opal. For the 20 best conformers after minimization the amber energy was )915 ± 25 kcalÆ mol)1, the maximum NOE restraint violations ° 0.10 ± 0 A, the maximum dihedral angle restraint violations 2.05 ± 0.18 degrees, the rmsd to the mean for

mature SP-C) as compared to SP-C(1­17) are in agreement with an N-terminal extension of the a-helical structure [32]. CD studies of SP-Ci(1­31) and AlaSP-Ci(1­31) at different pH The stability of SP-Ci is pH dependent, which prompted us to study the structure of SP-Ci(1­31) at different pH. At pH 6, SP-Ci(1­31) in microsome lipids shows a CD spectrum that indicates the presence of both a-helix and b-strand structures (Fig. 3). An increase in random structure, as judged from the shift to lower wavelengths of the broad minimum was observed when the pH was lowered to 5 (Fig. 3). Spectra recorded at pH 4 and 3 were similar to the pH 5 spectrum (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with SP-Ci(1­31) incorporated in surfactant lipids (data not shown). Due to solubility problems, CD spectra recorded at pH 7 gave low signal : noise ratios. AlaSP-Ci(1­31) in microsome lipids at pH 6 gives a CD spectrum which indicates the presence of random and helical structures (Fig. 3), and no change is seen when the pH is lowered to 5. As for SP-Ci(1­31), very similar results were obtained when the peptide was incorporated in surfactant lipids. Aggregation and fibril formation of SP-C with and without the propeptide The more stable a-helix and lower surface activity of SP-Ci compared to SP-C may be a result of noncovalent interactions between the N-terminal dodecapeptide part and the SP-Ci helix. A fivefold molar excess of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal dodecapeptide of SP-Ci was incubated with SP-C in aqueous organic solvents. Peptide aggregation was

Figure 1 shows the heavy atoms for the superimposed 20 best conformers. The structure of SP-Ci(1­31) in DPC micelles is disordered from Ser1 to Gly11, shows a turn in the region Arg12 to Phe13, an extended stretch involving Gly14 and Ile15, a turn from Pro16 to Phe18, and an a-helix from Pro19 to Leu31. The a-helix of SP-Ci(1­31) in DPC micelles thus starts four residues N-terminally of the helix of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1­17 of mature SP-C in DPC micelles, the latter starting at Lys11 [31], corresponding to Lys23 of SP-Ci(1­31). This conclusion was confirmed by chemical shift analysis for Ha protons in comparable parts of the two peptides (Fig. 2).

determined via measurements of the rate of disappearance of soluble protein, as described for SP-C [18,29]. The insoluble protein species are not ionized in a MALDI experiment, and a decrease in protein [M+H]+ ion current will be related to a decrease of protein concentration in solution and an increase in insoluble matter, i.e. aggregated protein. The stability of SP-C in 95% aqueous ethanol was analysed by

recording MALDI MS over time, and normalizing the ion intensities to a nonaggregating internal standard, SP-C33. SP-C incubated with the dodecapeptide shows slower aggregation kinetics than SP-C alone (Fig. 4). Electron micrographs of insoluble material were taken after 168 h incubation (Fig. 5). For SP-C alone, typical amyloid-like fibrils were visible. However, SP-C incubated with the dodecapeptide did not form fibrils.

Instead, amorphous aggregates were detected after the same incubation period. Surface activity of SP-C with and without the propeptide The surface activity of 2% (w / w) SP-C in 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) / 1-palmitoyl2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 7 : 3 (w / w), vesicles, and SP-C in the same vesicles plus 2.5- or 5-fold molar excess of the SP-Ci N-terminal dodecapeptide were determined with a captive bubble surfactometer (Fig. 6). The adsorption characteristics of SP-C with a 2.5-fold molar excess of dodecapeptide in phospholipids were similar to those of SP-C alone. In contrast, the mixture with five times excess of the dodecapeptide showed slow adsorption and did not reach the same surface tension within 5 min as the samples with SP-C alone or SP-C with 2.5 times excess of dodecapeptide. Samples with SP-C alone or SP-C with 2.5-fold excess of dodecapeptide behaved in a similar manner and could be compressed to a minimum surface tension of  0 mnÆm)1 from a maximum surface tension of  25 mnÆm)1. However, a fivefold excess of the dodecapeptide resulted in poor surface activity; the minimum surface tension was  10 mnÆm)1, the maximum surface tension was  50 mnÆm)1, and a larger compression of the surface area was required to reach minimum surface tension.

Discussion
The NMR structure of SP-Ci(1­31) in DPC micelles is disordered from Ser1 to Gly11, shows turn and extended structures from residue Arg12 to Phe18, and an a-helix from Pro19 to Leu31 (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with the notion that the region from Ile15 to Phe18 of SP-Ci has a high probalility of forming b-turns [33]. In contrast, SP-C(1­17) in DPC micelles
930

is disordered from Leu1 to Leu10 and contains an a-helix starting at Lys11 (corresponding to SP-Ci residue 23) [31]. This indicates that the presence of the N-terminal dodecapeptide extension in SP-Ci results in structural ordering of the region corresponding to the  10 N-terminal residues of SP-C and also N-terminally extends the a-helix four residues. This stabilization probably contributes to the significantly longer half-life in neutral solvents of the SP-Ci a-helix than that of SP-C [29]. It is conceivable that the increased stability of SP-Ci, compared to SP-C, is important in order to prevent helix unfolding with concomitant aggregation during the transport and processing of proSP-C in the type II cell. In line with this, the final proteolytic processing of SP-Ci to generate SP-C occurs late in the secretory pathway, when SP-Ci is embedded in surfactant phospholipids in the lamellar body [20].

Properties of SP-C N-terminal propeptide

In contrast to the pronounced stability of SP-Ci in neutral solvents, SP-Ci in acidified solvents undergoes unfolding and formation of amyloid-like fibrils within the same time frame as SP-C [29]. The reduced stability at low pH may in part be explained by the results from the CD experiments of SP-Ci(1­31) in microsomal and surfactant lipids, which show that the peptide undergoes a shift in conformation as the pH is lowered from 6 to 5 (Fig. 3). The CD spectra indicate that this conformational shift is associated mainly with an increase in disordered structure. Since the unpolar a-helix of SP-Ci(1­31) is supposedly embedded in the lipids and the N-terminal end is exposed to the aqueous environment [34], the structural disordering is most likely localized to the N-terminal part. Lamellar bodies are acidic, pH 5.5­6 [30], and it is possible that the pH dependence now observed of the conformation of SP-Ci(1­31) reflects that in the early secretory pathway the N-terminal part of SP-Ci is folded and the a-helix is stabilized, while in the lamellar bodies increased disorder of the N-terminal part facilitates its proteolytic removal. This is in line with the observation that complete processing to SP-C in lamellar bodies can be inhibited by disruption of the acidic environment [35]. AlaSP-Ci (1­31) incorporated into microsomal or surfactant lipids showed a combination of random and helical structure independent of pH (Fig. 3). This suggests that the N-terminal hexapeptide of SP-Ci (SPPDYS), which is replaced with AAAAAA in AlaSP-Ci(1­31), is important for stabilization of the N-terminal region at neutral pH and for the pH dependent conformational change. It can be noted that Asp4 is the only acidic residue of SPCi, and that the PPDYS motif is conserved in all species analysed. The N-terminal region of SP-Ci (residues 10­18 of proSP-C) is important for targeting the protein to distal compartments [21], but whether this function is related to the pH dependent stabilization now observed remains to be investigated. SP-C can irreversibly transform from its native a-helical structure to b-sheet aggregates and form amyloid-like fibrils both in vivo and in vitro [11­15], while the a-helix of SP-Ci does not unfold in neutral solvents and consequently does not form fibrils [29]. This indicates that the 12-residue elongation at the N-terminal end of SP-Ci stabilizes the helix. Addition of a fivefold molar excess of the N-terminal dodecapeptide in trans retards SP-C aggregation and prevents the formation of typical amyloid-like fibrils, as judged by electron microscopy (Figs 4 and 5). This suggests that interactions between the dodecapeptide and the N-terminal part of SP-C in solution stabilizes the poly Val helix, and thereby reduces its unfolding and concomitant aggregation into b-sheets.

Phospholipid vesicles containing SP-Ci have lower surface activity than those with SP-C [28]. A possible explanation for this difference is that the presence of the N-terminal elongation in SP-Ci interferes with the ability of the SP-C N-terminal part to interact with phospholipids. The N-terminal segment of SP-C has intrinsic propensity to interact with phospholipid membranes, mediated by both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions [33,36,37]. Adding a fivefold molar excess of the SP-Ci N-terminal dodecapeptide reduces the surface activity of SP-C in DPPC / POPG (Fig. 6), making it similar to that of SP-Ci in the same lipid mixture [28]. This indicates that SP-C and the dodecapeptide interact in the presence of phospholipids, as concluded for the same mixture in organic solvents (see above), and that such interactions block the surface activity of SP-C. In conclusion, the properties of a late processing intermediate of proSP-C suggest that the N-terminal propeptide part can regulate the stability and activity of the mature peptide.

Experimental procedures
Peptides
SP-Ci(1­31) (Table 1) was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using f-Moc chemistry. In SP-Ci(1­31), palmitoylCys at positions 17 and 18 is replaced by Phe, and Val at positions 28­31 is replaced by Leu compared to the wild-type human peptide. Phe was chosen as canine SP-C has one palmitoylCys replaced by Phe [38] and the Val fi Leu replacements were introduced to prevent b-sheet aggregation caused by polyVal [18]. The synthetic SP-Ci(1­31) peptide was dissolved in HAc, followed by dilution with aqueous ethanol to a final mixture containing acetic acid / ethanol / water, 3 : 2 : 5 (v / v). After filtration to remove undissolved material, the supernatant was applied to a C18 reversed phase HPLC column. SP-Ci(1­31) was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile / 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) running into 0.1% aqueous TFA. Fractions corresponding to SP-Ci(1­31), as detected by MALDI MS, were collected and dried. The dried peptide was stored at )20 °C until use. The N-terminal dodecapeptide of SP-Ci (SPPDYSAAPRGR) and AlaSP-Ci(1­31) (Table 1) were from Thermo BioSciences GmbH, Ulm, Germany. The SP-C analogue, SP-C33 (Table 1), was synthesized and isolated as described [39].

Isolation of porcine SP-C and surfactant phospholipids
SP-C was purified from the modified natural surfactant Curosurf (Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy), which contains phospholipids, SP-B and SP-C. Curosurf paste was

dissolved in methanol / dichloroethane, 4 : 1 (v / v), and the phospholipids and hydrophobic proteins were separated by reversed-phase HPLC using a Lipidex 5000 column (40 · 6.5 cm) [40]. Fractions containing SP-B and SP-C were pooled, dried, and redissolved in chloroform / methanol / 0.1 m hydrochloric acid, 19 : 19 : 2 (v / v) and SP-C and SP-B were then separated by size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex LH60 column (80 · 2.5 cm) [41]. Fractions containing SP-B and SP-C were further purified by reverse phase HPLC to separate SP-C from SP-B [42]. The samples were applied to a C18 column (Waters), using a flow rate of 0.7 mLÆmin)1. A mixture of 50% aqueous methanol / 0.1% TFA served as the initial mobile phase and a linear gradient from 0% to 100% of 2-propanol with 0.1% TFA was used for elution. The fractions under the SP-C peak were collected, dried under nitrogen and stored in 95% ethanol at )20 °C. MALDI MS confirmed the correct covalent structure of SP-C.

CD spectroscopy
Two-hundred micromoles of SP-Ci(1­31) and AlaSP-Ci(1­ 31) in 0.1 mgÆmL)1 microsome lipids or surfactant lipids were suspended in phosphate buffer and analysed at different pHs. The CD spectra were recorded, accumulated and averaged in a JASCO J 810 instrument from 190 nm to 260 nm at 22 °C using a scan speed of 50 nmÆmin)1, a response time of 2 s, and three spectra per sample. The residual molar ellipticity was calculated after determination of peptide concentration via amino acid analysis.

MALDI MS Isolation of microsomal lipids
Five grams of rabbit liver were minced and rinsed in sucrose. Thereafter, the tissue was homogenized in 10 mm Tris / HCl pH 7.4 containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 60 min. The pellet was aliquoted and stored at )80 °C until further use. Microsomal lipids were extracted from the 100 000 g pellets by sonication in chloroform / methanol / water, 8 : 4 : 3 (v / v). After centrifugation and removal of the methanol / water phase, the organic phase was washed with chloroform / methanol / water, 3 : 48 : 47 (v / v). The combined organic phases were dried under vacuum. Approximately 50 lm SP-C or the same concentration of SP-C with a fivefold molar excess of the SP-Ci N-terminal dodecapeptide SPPDYSAAPRGR were incubated in 95% aqueous ethanol at 22 °C. MALDI MS was used for recording the aggregation of SP-C by measurements of the rate of disappearance of soluble protein, compared to an internal standard of the nonaggregating SP-C33 [18]. The samples were dried on a stainless steel sample plate containing  5 lg predried a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and analysed using a Voyager DePro MALDI TOF (PerSeptive Biocystems) instrument operated in the positive ion mode [29].

Electron microscopy
The samples obtained after incubation of SP-C or SP-C / dodecapeptide in 95% aqueous ethanol were centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min. After removal of supernatants, the pellets were washed three times with 100 lL water to remove the organic solvent. After final centrifugation, pellets were suspended in a small volume of water under low-energy sonication for 5 s. Aliquots of 10 lL of the suspended pellets were placed on grids covered by a formvar film. After air-drying, the grids were negatively stained with 1% (w / v) uranyl acetate in water. The stained grids were examined and photographed in a Philips CM120TWIN electron microscope operated at 80 kV.

NMR measurements
NMR measurements of 0.5 mm SP-Ci(1­31) in 35 mm DPC, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, in 90% H2O / 10% D2O, were performed at 20 °C on a Bruker DMX 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, or on a Varian Unity 800 MHz spectrometer. At 800-MHz a NOESY spectrum was recorded (mixing time 40 ms, 4000 · 1800 data points, t1,max ¼ 100 ms, t2,max ¼ 225 ms, total measurement time 72 h). The following spectra were recorded at 600 MHz: NOESY (parameters as above), TOCSY (mixing time 70 ms, 4000 · 1024 data points, t1,max ¼ 60 ms, t2,max ¼ 225 ms, total measurement time 24 h), and COSY (4000 · 1800 data points, t1,max ¼ 100 ms, t2,max ¼ 225 ms, total measurement time 48 h). NOESY and TOCSY spectra (recording parameters as above) were recorded at 10 °C of a sample of 0.5 mm SP-Ci(1­31) in [2H5]-ethanol, using a Bruker DMX 600MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Assignments of signals were done in a standard way [43] by using homo-

Captive bubble surface activity measurements
The lipids DPPC and POPG in a proportion of 7 : 3 (w / w), were suspended in chloroform / methanol, 98 : 2 (v / v). Porcine SP-C alone, or porcine SP-C together with 2.5- or 5-fold molar excess of the dodecapeptide SPPDYSAAPRGR, were dissolved in chloroform / methanol, 1 : 1 (v / v), and added to

the lipid mixture. The final SP-C concentration was 2% by total mass of phospholipids. The mixtures were dried under nitrogen and suspended in saline at a lipid concentration of 10 mgÆmL)1. Surface tension was recorded by a captive bubble surfactometer under quasi-static conditions [46]. The air bubble was injected into an airtight chamber containing agarose solution. Lipid / peptide mixtures were then injected to cover the surface of the air bubble. After an initial adsorption for 5 min, the bubble was compressed stepwise until the minimal surface area was achieved, and then the bubble was expanded stepwise to the original surface area. This process was repeated five times for each bubble.
