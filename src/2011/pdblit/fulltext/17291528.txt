to variation in source and extraction conditions. Often, the material and mechanical properties required of extracted proteins are not compatible with their natural design. Processing treatments, such as derivatization and crosslinking, designed to improve these properties can destroy the essential biological activities. Protein polymer technology provides the possibility of integrating mechanical, functional and chemical properties into the same polymer chain TM, and permits the production of large quantities of these polymers of consistent quality from batch to batch. The many advantages, combined with the possibility of creating multifunctional molecules incorporating beneficial therapeutic activities, increases the impetus for product development. One goal is the design and production of a material that would stimulate and modify normal healing processes. The repair of damaged dermal and connective tissue is a complicated process which uses normal cellular mechanisms of degradation and biosynthesis to rebuild the damaged tissues by redepositing extracellular matrices. The

use of a bioengineered, protein-based, implanted material or wound dressing at the site of injury could not only re-establish normal function, but could also influence the amount and composition of the material. The inclusion within a biodegradable wound matrix of cellular attachment sites, growth stimulators and anti-microbial compounds could efficiently coordinate tissue regeneration in a localized and easily administered form. Engineering of proteins with specified properties provides a great opportunity for the creation of novel materials, though a number of problems need to be overcome before extensive commercialization can occur. However, as our capabilities in protein production and material processing improve, the materials industry will be provided with substances whose compositions and properties, for now, at least, are limited only by the chemistry of the naturally occurring amino acids.

Pandora's communications?
In a recent editorial 'What to do with extraneous data?' (Nature 346, p. 215), John Maddox invited prospective contributors to Nature to send material additional to the text of their papers. This material (supporting material, bulky tables, observations or whatever) was to be related in some way to the text, and would be made available to enquirers through the simple medium of the photocopy. Access to such data may be valuable to others, to avoid repetition of research, to support emerging ideas and generally further the pursuit of knowledge. Is this an unprecedented move? Not as such - unpublished lists and data of all kinds have long been available informally to members of scholarly clubs and societies. In

addition, the growing databases of nucleic acid sequence data defy publication in the time-honoured manner and are only accessible to purchasers or hirers of database services. The growing problem is that the provenance, quality and significance of such information is difficult to anticipate and therefore to search. The novelty of the present proposal lies in the establishing of a semi-public archive b y one of the most respected scientific publishing houses. Will people submit extra data to Nature? People are keen t o publish in this journal because of its wide circulation and accorded prestige. The main article type in Nature, the letter, requires economy of prose and compression of data. Compe-

tition to 'get in' will mean that people will indeed send supporting data (figures, tables, diagrams etc.) but with the purpose of lubricating the peer-review process, rather than the altruistic motive of the good of science. When a stone is thrown into the centre of a pond, the ripples spread wide. Other journals keen to keep up in the rankings, may offer similar facilities. The size of the informal scientific archive may grow. Unfortunately, such deposited scientific material is not abstracted or searchable like the published literature, but accessible only through an enquiry about the existence of 'associated material'. In the case of the proposal by Nature, one will need to obtain a copy of the article to see the announcement that other data exists. A further problem associated with the existence of (theoretically) public, but not published, material is citation in subsequent publications. Should an author refer to data which he/she knows to exist but not in a published form, and, if so, how can this be done?

This could make Some common procedures even more time-consuming and expensive. For example, material deposited in this way would almost certainly constitute 'disclosure' in patent law. It could lead to patent applications made in good faith being invalid and subsequently challenged by the original depositors or tirelessly vigilant patent examiners. Reviewers of original articles too may find that even more of their precious time is taken in enquiries - perhaps the authors or

others had already deposited elsewhere the data described in their paper. Then there is the bench scientist h i m s e l f - the prime producer what does he think about the emergence of data that you can't get at except by writing for it? In essence, what appears to be a good idea may turn into a bad one for the consumers. This might be avoided if publishers offering such informal archiving facilities ensure some kind of 'flag' (e.g. key words for the informally held data) is present

in the abstracts upon which the academic and commercial research communities increasingly rely. Without this safeguard, such endeavours could open not only the drawers of data or m u s e u m specimens that no-one knew existed, but also the scientific communication equivalent of Pandora's Box!

The international high priests and acolytes of protein chemistry met in San Diego in August 1. Hi-tech instrumental research was in the ascendency. Honours went to the structural scientists: Rachel Klevit (NMR structure of zinc-finger transcription factors) and Kurt Wutherich (NMR structure of proteins), and glory to the crystallographers (see Holmes below). X-ray crystallography and NMR have contributed so much to our understanding of mechanism, yet traces of an old love-hate relationship remain! I remember experiencing this at first hand in the 1970s as a graduate student in protein crystallography at Oxford university. One Raymond Dwek leaned over my rather pathetic low-resolution balsa wood protein model and shook his head. 'Protein crystallography will soon be dead long live NMR!' This sentiment was (and still is) premature, although it has long since been accepted that certain regions of proteins do behave a little differently in the crystal and in homogeneous solution. It was interesting to see the attention that mass spectrometry is now commanding from biochemists. The new 'soft' ionization techniques meaning lasers and droplet sprayers are delivering intact protein molecular ions of up to 200 kDa to mass analysers for accurate molecular

weight determination. Post-translational modifications can, in principle, be detected and identified without the need for lengthy fragmentation and purification of peptides (see 'Workshop' article, p. 301 of this issue.) For me, however, the show was stolen by two 'muscle' men (Ken Holmes of the Heidelberg MaxPlanck Institute and James Spudich of Stanford University) talking about their dissection of the molecular machinery of movement. Ken Holmes described how the atomic structure of actin had finally yielded to X-ray analysis 2. The tendency of monomeric (G) actin to polymerize to the filamentous (F) form was avoided by crystallizing the DNaseI-G-actin complex. A crystal structure of G-actin-profilin is also under way 3. Both proteins bind very tightly to G-actin and, by inference, bind to- or hinder actinactin interactions, preventing polymerization. We see now that actin consists of two rather similarly folded domains each made up of two subdomains. These are roughly disposed as if at the corners of a piece of squaresectioned channelling (see Fig. 1). In the open channel, there is a binding site for ADP or ATP. There are some interesting homologies with known ATP-binding

proteins. The polypeptide chain in the domains one and three has the same topology as hexokinase, but the actin molecule turns out to be strikingly similar to the N-terminal region (44 kDa) of a heat-shock protein, HSC70 (Ref. 4). HSC70 acts in an ATP-dependent manner to remove the assembled ctathrin coats from coated vesicles. Actin-bound ATP is hydrolysed when G-actin polymerizes to the F form, but although the crystal structure was determined with both ATP and ADP, there are as yet no clues to the mechanism. Of course, this may be because actin is constrained in its complex with DNase. Holmes and his colleagues have used the actin conformation in the complex to work out the orientation of the monomer in the F-actin fibril 5. Electron microscopy of actin filaments long ago revealed two helical chains of actin monomers twining slowly about each other (the 'two-start' helix). By calculating the X-ray scattering of different orientations of the monomer, a good match to the X-ray fibre diffraction pattern of oriented F-actin gels was obtained. One very important consequence of discovering the F-actin structure is that the amino acid sequence exposed at the surface of the fibril is known in atomic detail. In addition to myosin, a rather large number of actin-binding proteins have been described and this model will now serve many workers as a tool for unravelling molecular mechanisms of cellular motion, cytoskeletal structure and their regulation.
