R-Amino--caprolactam (ACL) racemase (ACLR) from Achromobacter obae catalyzes the interconversion of L- and D-ACL. ACLR belongs to the fold-type I group of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. In this study, the first crystal structures of a fold-type I racemase are solved for the native form and -caprolactam-complexed form of ACLR at 2.21 and 2.40 Å resolution, respectively. Based on the location of -caprolactam in the complex structure, the substrate-binding site is assigned between Trp49 and Tyr137. The carboxyl group of Asp210 is a reasonable candidate that recognizes the nitrogen atom of a lactam or amide in the substrate. Based on a structural comparison with fold-type III alanine racemase, Tyr137 is potentially the acid/base catalytic residue that is essential for the two-base racemization mechanism. The overall structure of ACLR is similar to that of fold-type I enzymes. A structural comparison with these enzymes explains the different reaction specificities.
ABSTRACT:

The soil bacteria Achromobacter obae produce an R-amino-caprolactam (ACL)1 racemase (ACLR, EC 5.1.1.15) in the cytoplasm (1). This racemase was isolated from A. obae in order to racemize D-aminolactam for industrial use (2). ACLR from A. obae is a pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of Land D-aminolactam, such as L- and D-ACL (1, 2) (Figure 1). ACLR is unique among racemases because it acts exclusively on a noncarboxylic compound, i.e., an intramolecular cyclic amide with an R-amino group (1). This enzyme was used in combination with L-ACL hydrolase from Cryptococcus laurentii for industrial L-lysine production from D,L-ACL (1, 3, 4). Recently, amino acid amide racemizing activity was discovered in ACLR (5). Therefore, ACLR can be used in combination with a D-stereospecific amino acid amidase, such as D-aminopep This work was partly supported by a research grant (18380061) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences to Y.A.  Coordinate and structure factors of the native and -caprolactam complex structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 3DXV and 2ZUK. * Corresponding author.

tidase (DAP) (6), for D-amino acid production with 100% theoretical yield (7, 8). To date, all PLP-dependent enzymes whose structures have been solved are classified into at least five fold types, I-V, based on similarities in primary and secondary structures (9-11). There are no correlations between fold types and reaction types. The PLP-dependent racemases that have been identified to date are classified into fold types I, II, or III (12). ACLR is classified as a fold-type I group of PLPdependent enzymes based on the amino acid sequence homology. The crystal structures of serine racemase, a foldtype II enzyme (PDB ID 1V71, 1WTC; unpublished), and alanine racemase, a fold-type III enzyme (13), were previously determined. However, the crystal structure of a racemase that belongs to fold-type I has not been determined. The enzymes that belong to the fold-type I classification are well-characterized PLP-dependent enzymes (11). They invariably function as homodimers or higher order oligomers, with two active sites per dimer. They contain representative examples of multiple reaction types, such as decarboxylation and transamination. Therefore, comparing the structures of fold-type I enzymes with different reactions may indicate the reasons for these different mechanisms. In this study, the crystal structure of native ACLR was determined at 2.21 Å resolution. The structures of -capro-

lactam and ACL are similar, and -caprolactam is reported to be a competitive inhibitor of ACLR (1). To determine the mechanism of both -caprolactam inhibition and substrate recognition, the crystal structure of ACLR complexed with -caprolactam was determined at 2.40 Å resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first structural report of a fold-type I racemase. The dimer is clearly the catalytically active entity. The candidate acid/base catalytic residue that is essential for the racemization reaction was assigned by comparing this structure to a fold-type III alanine racemase. In addition, comparisons with other fold-type I enzymes are also analyzed in order to understand different reaction specificities. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Production, Crystallization, and X-ray Diffraction Data Collection. An Escherichia coli transformant expressing ACLR was prepared as follows. A modified DNA fragment encoding ACLR was obtained by PCR amplification using 50 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.85), 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 mM dNTP, sense and antisense primers (1 µM each), 2.5 units of Pwo DNA polymerase, and 500 ng of plasmid pACL60 (template) (5) for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The sense primer was 5-GGCATAGCATATGACGAAGGCGCTTTACGATCG3 (NdeI recognition site underlined), and the antisense primer was 5-ACTCCGTGGATCCACGTTTTACCAGCCAGCGAACTGCGCGATTTC-3 (BamHI recognition site underlined). The amplified PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then purified with a QIA quick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). The amplified DNA was inserted downstream of a T7 promoter in pET15b, yielding pET15ACL, which was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET15ACL was subcultured at 37 °C for 12 h in a test tube containing 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with 80 µg/mL ampicillin. The subculture was then cultured at 37 °C for 5 h in 8 L of LB medium supplemented with 80 µg/mL ampicillin. Then 0.5 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture, and the culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with 0.85% NaCl. The buffer used throughout this study was 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (KPB; pH ) 7.0), containing 250 mM sucrose and 20 µM PLP. The cells were resuspended in 0.1 M buffer and disrupted by sonication for 10 min (19 kHz; Insonator model 201M; Kubota, Tokyo, Japan). To remove intact cells and cell debris, the lysate was centrifuged at 8000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was heated at 60 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation. The resulting soluble fraction was purified using Ni Sepharose highperformance (Amersham) and anion-exchange chromatography (HiTrapQFF). The His moiety was proteolytically removed with a thrombin protease, and the thrombin was removed by benzamidine Sepharose 6B. ACLR crystals formed at 20 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, with a mixture of 1.3 µL of protein (23.3 mg/mL) in buffer containing 70 mM KPB (pH ) 7.0), 100 µM PLP, and 1.5 µL of reservoir solution [30% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.2 M magnesium chloride, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), and 0.3

µL of additive solution (30% (w/v) sucrose)]. Hexagonal-shaped crystals grew to 0.05 mm × 0.05 mm × 0.03 mm in size within 14 days. The crystals belong to the space group P21, with a ) 56.5 Å, b ) 61.1 Å, c )105.2 Å, and ) 103.3°. There are two molecules per asymmetric unit. The crystals were directly frozen in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. -Caprolactam complex crystals were prepared by soaking native crystals in a solution of 30% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.2 M magnesium chloride, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH ) 8.7), 2.9% (w/v) sucrose, 42 µM PLP, and 20 mM -caprolactam. As the soaking time increased, the diffraction quality of the crystal was severely deteriorated. As the diffraction quality of the native crystal was minimally deteriorated by soaking for 5 min in the soaking solution without 20 mM -caprolactam, we think that the deterioration of the soaked crystal supports binding of -caprolactam. Furthermore, the position and the Bfactor of -caprolactams in a 30 s soaked complex were almost the same as those for a 10 min soaked complex (data not shown). Therefore, 30 s was judged to be sufficient to form the -caprolactam complex. Diffraction data for native ACLR were collected at 100 K on beamline BL13B1 at NSRRC (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Diffraction data for the 30 s soaked -caprolactam complex was collected at 100 K on beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). These data were processed and scaled using the HKL 2000 program package (14). Structure Solution and Refinement. The data were subsequently processed using the CCP4 program suite (15). The native structure of ACLR was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (16) with a search model taken from -aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-AT) of E. coli (PDB code 1SF2) (17), which has 29% amino acid sequence identity. Refinement and subsequent model building were performed using the programs REFMAC 5 (18) and COOT (19), respectively. Water molecules were added using

Model Building. The MOE (version 2006.08; Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada) was used to construct the atomic model of the L-ACL-PLP external aldimine

complex of ACLR and to perform energy minimization. First, the internal aldimine (PLP and Lys267) was deleted from subunit B of ACLR. Based on the E. coli GABA-AT

complex with aminooxyacetate (AOA) (PDB code 1SFF), conformation of the Lys267 side chain of ACLR was changed. Then, the L-ACL-PLP model was introduced into the active site of subunit B of native ACLR by reference to the location and conformation of external aldimine AOAPLP and -caprolactam in the complex. The atomic model of ACLR with the external aldimine was constructed by energy minimization with restraints on the protein atoms except hydrogen atoms. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OVerall Structure of the Monomer. The monomer structure can be subdivided into three domains: an N-terminal domain (residues 3-43), a C-terminal domain (residues 321-436), and a large PLP-binding domain (residues 48-319) (Figure 2A). The N-terminal domain contains two R-helices and a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet. The PLP-binding domain comprises a central seven-stranded -sheet surrounded by eight R-helices. The C-terminal domain is composed of four R-helices and a five-stranded -sheet. The active site of the enzyme is centered around the PLP cofactor and is located

in the cleft between the PLP-binding site and C-terminal domain of the protein. OVerall Structure of the Dimer. In the crystalline state, two subunit molecules in the asymmetric unit form a tightly packed homodimer (Figure 2B). Superposition of the two subunits gives the rms deviation ) 0.38 Å for 420 (96%) structurally equivalent CR atoms. The largest deviation is found in the loop region from residues 97 to 101, and the largest displacement (7.4 Å) was observed in the CR of Glu99. Additionally, residues 149-160 were observed only in subunit B in the native structure, and the corresponding residues in subunit A were disordered (Figure 2C). Phe147 of subunit A appears to occupy two distinct positions. One of these positions is located at a hydrophobic pocket made by the Tyr118 and Phe203 side chains, similar to the position of Phe147 in subunit B. The other position is located near Tyr118 O. The position of the Phe147 side chain in subunit A near Tyr118 O is very close to the Ala159 side chain in subunit B (Figure 2C). Similarly, the position of the Asp210 side chain in subunit A is very close to the His150 side chain in subunit B. Approximately 4000 Å2 of the solvent-

Okazaki et al. -caprolactam forms a hydrogen bond with Lys241 N . However, the residue that forms a hydrogen bond to the N of -caprolactam could not be assigned. From the omit map of -caprolactam, another binding mode generated by a 180° rotation around the CdO bond of -caprolactam in Figure 3A appears possible (Supporting Information Figure S4). Because -caprolactam is reported to be a competitive inhibitor, the actual substrate, such as ACL, may be located at a position similar to where -caprolactam is located (Figure 3A). To predict the binding site and mode of the natural substrate and to identify the catalytically important residues, an energy-minimized model of the L-ACL-PLP external aldimine intermediate was produced by referring to the -caprolactam complex structure (Figure 3B). ACLR does not exhibit racemase activity toward D,L-amino acids but exhibits activity toward substrates containing the nitrogen of amides or lactams such as D,L-amino acid amides or D,Lcyclic amino lactams (1, 5, 22). Therefore, it is plausible to specify the residue that recognizes the nitrogen of amides or lactams. The structure of subunit B in native ACLR was chosen as a starting model because the position of Asp210 O2 in this structure is suitable to form a hydrogen bond with the lactam N of L-ACL. In this model, the C5-H bond of L-ACL is oriented at the si face of PLP, and a hydrogen atom of the C5-H faces Lys267 N (the distance between C5 and Lys267 N is 3.1 Å). This observation agrees with the consideration described below that Lys267 is a candidate acid/base catalytic residue and indicates the plausibility of this model. The ActiVe Site. PLP is bound in a distinct cleft in the enzyme and is involved in many specific interactions (Figure 3C). The C4 atom, which originally formed an aldehyde, connects covalently to the -amino group of Lys267 to form the internal aldimine (Schiff base) linkage (Supporting Information Figure S5). The pyridine nitrogen atom of PLP makes a salt bridge (about 2.8 Å) with Asp238 in ACLR. This interaction is the same as that of all known fold-type I enzymes (11). It is thought that Asp238 maintains the protonation of the nitrogen atom of PLP, thereby stabilizing the electron sink properties of PLP. This observation coincides with the expected basic racemization mechanism that proceeds through a quinonoid intermediate (11). The pyridine ring of PLP is sandwiched between Tyr137 and Val240. The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr137 interacts with the O2P in the PLP phosphate via water molecule Z28. Thr295* (from the neighboring subunit in the dimer) donates two hydrogen bonds from the main chain nitrogen and side chain oxygen atoms to the O2P of the phosphate group of PLP. The O1P of PLP forms two hydrogen bonds to Ser111 at the main chain nitrogen and side chain oxygen atoms. The O3P of PLP forms hydrogen bonds to two water molecules, Z1 and Z14. The unique residues near the ACLR active site are Trp436 and Asp210. ACLR has 12 or 13 additional unique residues at its C-terminus compared to other fold-type I enzymes (Figure 4). The C-terminal residue Trp436 extends into the active site and forms part of the active site cavity. The indole ring of Trp436 is stabilized by Leu19 through a hydrophobic interaction. Although the role of Trp436 in ACLR function is unclear, based on its location, Trp436 may be important for substrate specificity. On the other hand, the carboxyl group of the Asp210 side chain points toward the active site

The surface is colored according to the electrostatic potential of the residues (blue, positive; red, negative).

accessible surface area per monomer (approximately onefourth of the monomer surface) is buried upon dimer formation. Subunits A and B in the dimer of native ACLR in the asymmetric unit are stabilized by 48 interchain hydrogen bonds (Supporting Information Table S1). In ACLR, the N-terminal domain of the subunit A interacts extensively with the PLP-binding domain of the subunit B like other fold-type I enzymes. This long list underscores the strength of the intersubunit interactions in this dimer and indicates that ACLR forms a dimer in solution like other fold-type I enzymes (11). The two PLP cofactors are located close to each other at the subunit interface of the dimer (the PLP phosphorus atoms are 16.2 Å apart). ACLR and -Caprolactam Complex. The overall structure of ACLR complexed with -caprolactam is essentially the same as that of the native form except for the disordering of residues 151-158 in subunit B (Supporting Information Figure S1). The electron density of a A-weighted Fo - Fc omit map of the active site in the -caprolactam complex is shown in Figure 3A. A comparison of the omit map and the atomic B factors between -caprolactam and the neighboring Trp436 residue indicates that the occupancy of -caprolactam is comparable to that of Trp436 (Supporting Information Figures S2 and S3), and it is considered that -caprolactam is bound at the active site in this complex (Figure 3A). The ring of -caprolactam is sandwiched between the aromatic side chains of Trp49 and Tyr137. The carbonyl O of

only in subunit B of the native structure. This conformation of Asp210 is interesting because there is a possibility that the carboxyl group of Asp210 plays a role in recognizing the nitrogen of an amide or lactam in the substrate (Figure 3B). Flexibility of Loop 149-160. Loop 149-160 is visible only in subunit B of native ACLR. This may be due to different crystal packing around the residues in the 149-160 loop, especially Asp155. The carboxyl group of Asp155 in subunit B of native ACLR forms bifurcated hydrogen bonds to Lys410 N in neighboring subunit A as an intermolecular contact, resulting in the loop order. In contrast, in subunit A of native ACLR the carboxyl group of Glu41 in neighboring subunit B replaces the basic Lys410 N . The loss of the intermolecular interaction between the loop and the neighboring subunit may lead to loop disorder in subunit A of native ACLR. Because residues 151-158 are observed in subunit B of a native ACLR that was soaked for 5 min in a solution without -caprolactam, residues 151-158 in subunit B get disordered by soaking in solution containing -caprolactam (Figure 5A). One potential reason for this disordering is that the above-mentioned hydrogen bond between Asp155 in subunit B and Lys410 in neighboring subunit A was disrupted in soaked -caprolactam and resulted in disordering 151-158 loop. In fact, the electron density of the Lys410

side chain in neighboring subunit A in the -caprolactam complex is weaker than that in the native structure. Loop 149-160 is considered to be flexible in solution because the substrate cannot access the active site if these residues remain ordered like those in subunit B of native ACLR (Figure 5B). The flexibility of the loop may come from Gly149 and Gly161, which work as a hinge in the loop. The flexibility of the loop also comes from weak interactions with the remaining region of ACLR. Only Ala159 N forms a hydrogen bond to Ala146 O, and hydrophobic interactions are observed only between the side chains of Val152 and that of Tyr137 and Trp436 in subunit B of native ACLR. Comparison with Fold-Type III Alanine Racemase. Alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1) belongs to the fold-type III group and is an extensively investigated PLP-dependent racemase (23). It employs a two-base mechanism with Tyr265* and Lys39 (11, 24-26). The overall structure of ACLR is quite different from that of alanine racemase. However, the positions of Tyr137 O and the Asp210 side chain in ACLR, which are situated on the re face of the PLP ring, symmetrically correspond to that of Tyr265* O and the Arg136 side chain of alanine racemase, which are situated on the si face of the PLP ring, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Therefore, if racemization of ACLR proceeds via a two-base mechanism, Tyr137 as well as Lys267 may be candidate acid/base catalytic residues. However, there remains some possibility

that Asp210 O1 is an acid/base catalytic residue instead of Tyr137 (Figure 3B). In alanine racemase, the NH1 of Arg136 and the main chain nitrogen of Met312* form the recognition site for the carboxyl group of the substrate (27) and contribute to fixation of the substrate suited for progressing the racemization reaction. In ACLR, Asp210 may contribute to the recognition of the nitrogen of an amide or lactam in the substrate and may fix the substrate suited for progressing the racemization reaction. The remarkable difference between alanine racemase and ACLR is the residue near the pyridine nitrogen of PLP. Asp238 in ACLR is located in the corresponding site of Arg219 in alanine racemase. As mentioned above, because the acidic residue Asp238 stabilizes the protonated pyridine nitrogen of PLP, the racemization mechanism of ACLR via the quinonoid intermediate is plausible. On the other hand, the racemization mechanism of alanine racemase, which is currently under discussion (26, 28), may be different from that of ACLR. In particular, Spies and Toney suggested that it proceeds via a quinonoid intermediate with a nonprotonated pyridine nitrogen of PLP (28). Because the protonation state of the pyridine nitrogen differs, the racemization mechanisms of ACLR and alanine racemase are probably not identical. Comparison with Other Fold-Type I Enzymes. ACLR shows significant sequence identity with E. coli GABA-AT

(17) (29% sequence identity with ACLR) and dialkylglycine decarboxylase (DGD) (29) (30% with ACLR) as shown in Figure 4. Supporting Information Figures S6A and S6B show overlays of the CR traces of these enzymes. The location and conformation of the PLP of ACLR are consistent with those of E. coli GABA-AT and DGD. The overall fold of ACLR is similar to that of E. coli GABA-AT and DGD. In addition, E. coli GABA-AT and DGD also form dimers. A superposition of ACLR and E. coli GABA-AT results in CR rms deviations of 1.53 Å at the monomer level and 1.97 Å at the dimer level for all structurally homologous CR atoms. Similarly, a superposition of ACLR and DGD results in CR rms deviations of 1.62 Å at the monomer level and 2.04 Å at the dimer level for all structurally homologous CR atoms. However, ACLR is unique among fold-type I enzymes in terms of additional C-terminal residues (Figures 4 and S6). Furthermore, the C-terminal residue Trp436 of ACLR extends into the active site and blocks the pathway that allows substrate access to the active site in subunit B of native ACLR (Figure 5B), as residues 15-17 in a closed form of a fold-type I aspartate aminotransferase (30). In E. coli GABA-AT and DGD, there is a pathway corresponding to positions Trp436 and Leu19 of ACLR, and this pathway is considered to play a role in allowing the substrate access to the active site.

Structure of R-Amino--caprolactam Racemase Figure 7A presents an overlay of the active site residues of ACLR with E. coli GABA-AT. E. coli GABA-AT catalyzes transamination in its normal catalytic cycle. Generally, the transamination reaction requires one base, Lys, at the active site (11). Lys268 in E. coli GABA-AT works as the base and binds to PLP. Tyr137, which is considered to be the candidate acid/base catalytic residue of ACLR, is surprisingly conserved as Tyr138 in E. coli GABA-AT. However, Tyr138 in E. coli GABA-AT may not be necessary for GABA-AT activity because this residue is replaced by Phe189 in pig liver GABA-AT (31). Moreover, other foldtype I transaminases, such as human ornithine aminotransferase, have Phe177 located in this position (32). The - and R-carboxylate groups of substrate R-ketoglutarate of E. coli GABA-AT are thought to be recognized by the guanidium groups of Arg141 and Arg398, respectively (17). In ACLR, these residues are replaced by Cys140 and Glu396, respectively. Figure 7B presents an overlay of the active site residues of ACLR with DGD. DGD catalyzes both decarboxylation and transamination in its normal catalytic cycle. The decarboxylation-dependent transamination reaction proceeds by a one-base mechanism with Lys272, similar to the transamination reaction (22). Tyr137 of ACLR is replaced by Trp138 in DGD. Therefore, the presence or absence of an acid/base residue located at the opposite face of the cofactor viewed from the active site Lys may make a difference in reaction specificity. The decarboxylation specificity of DGD is thought to be largely governed by the presence of Gln52 (33). This residue is replaced by Trp49 in ACLR. Additionally, Arg406 in DGD, which is thought to recognize the carboxylate of the substrate during transamination, is replaced by Glu396 in ACLR. CONCLUSIONS The crystal structures of native and -caprolactam complexed ACLR have been solved at 2.21 and 2.40 Å resolution, respectively. Based on the ACLR structure, the candidate acid/base catalytic residue, which is essential for the two-base racemization mechanism, is identified as Tyr137. Furthermore, the racemization mechanism of ACLR, as an example of a fold-type I racemase, is speculated to proceed via a quinonoid intermediate because of the presence of Asp238 near the pyridium nitrogen of PLP. This ACLR structural information will not only help structure/function studies on fold-type I racemases but also facilitate the molecular design of ACLR for industrial use. Additional mutational or kinetic studies are needed to confirm the role of Tyr137 as an acid/base catalytic residue, as was shown for alanine racemase (24, 34). Furthermore, similar to alanine racemase (26), structural analyses of the ACLR complex with reaction intermediate analogues are needed to understand the substrate recognition mechanism and to confirm the role of Asp210 as a recognition site for the nitrogen of an amide or lactam in the substrate.
