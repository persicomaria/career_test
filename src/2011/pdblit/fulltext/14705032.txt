Introduction. The TM0293 gene of Thermotoga maritima encodes -glutamyl phosphate reductase (GPR; EC 1.2.1.41), an enzyme that catalyzes the second step of proline biosynthesis, the reversible nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of L- -glutamyl phosphate to phosphate and L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde. The product then undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate.1 In higher organisms, such as plants and humans, GPR is the second domain of the bifunctional enzyme -1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS),2 which catalyzes the first two steps in proline biosynthesis. In plants, P5CS is the first enzyme in the metabolic pathway used for proline production in response to environmental factors, such as drought and salinity, that lead to osmotic stress.2 In humans, mutations in this enzyme result in developmental disorders characterized by joint hyperlaxity, skin hyperelasticity, cataracts, and mental retardation.3 Here, we report the crystal structure of T. maritima GPR at 2.0 Å resolution that represents the first structure of any GPR family member, a subfamily of the aldehyde dehydrogenase extended family.4 The GPR structure was determined using the automated high-throughput pipeline at the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (http://www.jcsg.org).5 The TM0293 structure (Fig. 1) was determined using the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. Data collection, model, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes TM0293 residues 2­ 415 and 299 water molecules. The Matthews coefficient (Vm) for TM0293 is 2.1 Å3/Da with an estimated solvent content of 52.3%.6 The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK 3.47 shows that 92.7% of the residues lie in the most favored regions, 7.0% in addition©

ally allowed regions, 0.0% in generously allowed regions, and 0.3% (His 390) in the disallowed regions. His 390 is the central residue in a classical -turn,8 with dihedral angles ( 75.8°, 61.4°) consistent with those expected for this type of secondary structural element. TM0293 was originally identified as a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family based on sequence homology. A structural similarity search, performed with the program DALI9 using the coordinates of TM0293, indicated that the closest known structure is the class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase from rat (PDB ID: 1AD3),10 with a 4.4 Å root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) over 361 residues (87%), and a sequence identity of 17%. The relatively high RMSD is mostly caused by domain rotation, and can be reduced to less than 2.0 Å RMSD when each domain (the cofactor binding domain I and the catalytic domain II; see below) is superimposed separately. TM0293 consists of a single 415­amino acid polypeptide chain composed of 16 -helices and 16 -strands [Fig. 1(A, C)]. Like other aldehyde dehydrogenases, GPR consists of three distinct domains. The first two domains, the cofactor binding domain I (residues 1­223) and the catalytic domain II (residues 224 ­371), both have an / architecture with a five-stranded parallel -sheet (32145 order) reminis-

The proposed catalytic cysteine, Cys255, is represented in ball-and-stick, with the sulfur in yellow; a prominent difference density around the Cys sulfhydryl group suggests it may be in an oxidized form (density not shown). The NADPH and hinge regions are indicated by arrows, and the N and C termini are labeled. (B) The crystallographic TM0293 tetramer; each monomer is colored separately. (C) Diagram showing the secondary structure elements of TM0293 superimposed on its primary sequence. Helices are labeled H1 to H19. Strands are labeled according to their respective -sheets: A (the oligomerization domain III), B (the cofactor binding domain I), C (the catalytic binding domain II) and D (the hinge). The locations of the hairpin loops, as well as the location of turns and turns, are also depicted in the diagram.

cent of the nucleotide binding Rossman fold, but usually classified in a distinct group.10 The third domain, the oligomerization domain III, is composed of an extended loop from domain I, residues 92­112, and the C-terminus, residues 401­ 415, that assemble into a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet [Fig. 1(A)]. The extended hinge region between domains I and II, composed of residues 371­ 400, forms an irregular but compact structure, markedly different from the analogous regions in other proteins of this structural family. The NADPH cofactor is not present in the TM0293 structure, but, based on sequence and struc-

tural homology to 1AD3,10 is expected to bind in the pocket formed by -helices 8 and 9, and -strands 3, 4, and 6 in the cofactor binding domain I [Fig. 1(A)]. Notably, almost no interactions occur between the coenzyme binding and catalytic domains of TM0293, and the cleft between the domains is very wide [Fig. 1(A)]. This differs significantly from the rat class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase structure (1AD3), in which the cofactor and catalytic domains interact extensively. In 1AD3,10 the phosphate tail of the NAD interacts with residues from the catalytic domain to properly position the catalytic cysteine

for nucleophilic attack.10 In the TM0293 structure, however, the catalytic domain is rotated away from the cofactor domain; superposition of the TM0293 and 1AD310 cofactor binding domains indicates that the most likely TM0293 candidate for the catalytic cysteine, Cys255, is over 8.2 Å away from the equivalent Cys243 in 1AD3. It is expected that the cofactor and catalytic domains of TM0293 will close around the NADPH and -glutamyl phosphate ligands upon binding in order to position Cys255 for catalysis [Fig. 1(A)]. TM0293 forms a crystallographic tetramer made up of a dimer of dimers [Fig. 1(B)]. The dimeric contact is extensive, burying over 2800 Å2 (total) of solvent exposed surface area, and is similar to the dimer interactions observed in 1AD3.10 The second tetrameric contact is also extensive, burying over 2100 Å2 (total). The biologically relevant oligomerization state of TM0293 is unknown, but a multimeric structure would be consistent with that observed for other members of the family, as most aldehyde dehydrogenases function as either dimers or tetramers.4,10 ­13 TM0293 is the first structure of a GPR determined to date. As predicted, TM0293 belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase structural family and catalyzes the reduction of L- -glutamyl phosphate to phosphate and L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde. We hypothesize that the mechanism of this reaction is similar to that of other aldehyde dehydrogenases,10 as the catalytic cysteine of the dehydrogenase family is conserved in TM0293.4 In addition, it has been proposed14 that GPR may form a complex in vivo with

-glutamyl kinase (GK), the first enzyme of the proline biosynthesis pathway. Future studies detailing the catalytic mechanism of GPR, and its potential interactions with GK, will enable the molecular mechanisms used by this protein, and its bifunctional homologue P5CS, to be elucidated. Detailed descriptions of these mechanisms will be critical for understanding P5CS function in the osmotic stress response of yeast and plants,2 and in development and disease in humans (online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM): 138250).3 Materials and Methods. Protein production: GPR (TIGR: TM0293; Swissprot: Q9WYC9) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu (Stratagene) from T. maritima strain MSB8 genomic DNA with primer pairs encoding the predicted 5 and 3 ends of TM0293. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pMH1, which encodes a purification tag consisting of the residues MGSDKIHHHHHH at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. The entire cloned region was verified by sequencing. Protein expression was performed in selenomethionine-containing medium using the Escherichia coli methionine auxotrophic strain DL41. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in Lysis Buffer [10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, and Roche ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor tablets]; DNase-1 (0.01 mg/mL in 1 mM MgCl2 storage buffer) was added just prior to sonication. Immediately after sonication, 0.3 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1.4 mM -mercaptoethanol

were added to lysate, and the cell debris was immediately pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 g for 45 min (4°C). After filtering, the soluble fraction was applied to POROS MC resin (Applied Biosystems) charged with nickel previously equilibrated in equilibration buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). The column was then washed with 30 mM imidazole, while the NaCl concentration was gradually reduced from 300 to 15 mM. The protein was then eluted with a 30 ­250 mM imidazole gradient (30 column volumes; CV) directly onto a Sepharose HQ POROS anion exchange column (Applied Biosystems). After 3 CV washes with 15 mM NaCl, the protein was eluted with a salt gradient from 15 mM to 500 mM NaCl (30 CV). The protein eluted in a single peak and was immediately concentrated to 10 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Orbital). The protein was either frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use or used immediately for crystallization trials. Crystallization: The protein was crystallized using the nanovolume vapor diffusion method.15 Crystallization robotics with miniaturized volume assemblies were used to set up crystallization trials in specialized 96-well microtiter trays (Greiner) containing 50 nL of protein solution and 50 nL of crystallization solution in a sitting drop format.5 Each protein was set up with 480 standard crystallization conditions [Wizard I/II, Cryo I/II (Emerald BioStructures, Bainbridge Island, WA), Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen 2, Crystal Screen Cryo, polyethylene glycol (PEG)/Ion Screen, Grid Screen Ammonium Sulfate, Grid Screen PEG 6000, Grid Screen MPD, and Grid Screen PEG/LiCl (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA)] at 20°C. Images of each crystal trial were taken at 7 and 28 days after setup with an Optimag Veeco Oasis 1700 imager and were evaluated manually. The crystallization conditions used to produced the final crystals for data collection were 12% mPEG 5000, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.4, at 25°C, using microseeding. Crystals grew within a day, and were indexed in the orthorhombic space group C222. The Matthews coefficient (Vm) for TM0293 is 2.1 Å3/Da with an estimated solvent content of 52.3%.6 Data Collection: Multiple wavelength MAD data were collected at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA) on beamline 5.0.2. All data sets were collected at 100 K with a Quantum 4 charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. Data were reduced and scaled using HKL2000.16 Data statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure solution and refinement: The structure was determined with use of the software package SOLVE.17 An initial model was then generated using RESOLVE17 and the Arp/wArp18 packages. Structure refinement was performed using CNS19 and rebuilt using O.20 The dataset used for refinement was the averaged dataset produced by SOLVE17 after merging the far, peak, and inflection datasets. The final round of refinement and rebuilding was performed using the CCP46 suite program Refmac21 and Xfit.22 The final model contains TM0293 residues 2­ 415 and 299 waters. Validation and deposition: Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the models was carried out using the JCSG
