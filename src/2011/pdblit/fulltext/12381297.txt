Solution Structure of Human Initiation Factor eIF2 Reveals Homology to the Elongation Factor eEF1B
Takuhiro Ito, Assen Marintchev, and Gerhard Wagner* Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Harvard Medical School Boston, Massachusetts 02115 nus and a zinc binding motif near the C terminus. The lysine blocks play a role in binding to the heteropentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B and the GAP eIF5 (Asano et al., 1999), and the zinc binding motif seems to be involved with a regulation of GTP hydrolysis (Castilho-Valavicius et al., 1992; Huang et al., 1997). The subunit is considered to function primarily as a regulatory element of eIF2 and is the target of many eIF2 kinases that are activated by various forms of cell stress: the double-stranded RNA-activated kinase PKR is activated by virus infection (Kaufman, 2000), the hemeregulated inhibitor HRI by iron deficiency (Chen, 2000), the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK by increased amounts of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (Ron and Harding, 2000), and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase GCN2 and its mammalian homolog by amino acid starvation (Hinnebusch, 1996). Ser51 in eIF2 has been identified as a phosphorylation site for these kinases. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of Ser51 in eIF2 results in a strong inhibition of translation initiation. This is caused by an increased affinity of phosphorylated eIF2 for eIF2B, which results in a decreased GDP/GTP exchange rate on eIF2, and thus a decreased population of the activated GTP-bound form of eIF2 (Pavitt et al., 1998). Here, we present the solution structure of human eIF2 determined with NMR spectroscopy. The structure shows that eIF2 consists of two domains that are mobile relative to each other. The N-terminal domain (NTD) contains two subdomains and is consistent with the previously determined crystal structure (Dhaliwal and Hoffman, 2003; Nonato et al., 2002), and the C-terminal domain (CTD), for which no previous structural information had been available, has an -fold. Surprisingly, this domain exhibits a fold and shape closely similar to the CTD of the translation elongation factor eEF1B , despite the lack of any sequence homology. eEF1B functions as a GEF for eEF1A. The latter is known to be homologous to eIF2 (Schmitt et al., 2002). Thus, our finding reveals a new case of molecular similarity between elongation and initiation machinery and indicates a common evolutionary origin for eIF2 and eEF1B . Based on these structural similarities, a possible model for the function of the CTD of eIF2 is presented.

Summary The GTP-bound form of the trimeric eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) transfers aminoacylated initiator methionyl tRNA onto the 40S ribosome. We have solved with solution NMR the structure of the subunit of human eIF2 (heIF2 ). The protein consists of two domains that are mobile relative to each other. The N-terminal domain has an S1-type oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-fold subdomain and an -helical subdomain. The C-terminal domain adopts an -fold very similar to the C-terminal domain of elongation factor (eEF) 1B , the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for eEF1A. The structural and functional similarities found between eIF2 /eIF2 and eEF1B /eEF1A suggest a model for the interaction of eIF2 with eIF2 , and eIF2 with Met-tRNA iMet. It further indicates a previously unrecognized evolutionary lineage of eIF2 / from the functionally related elongation factor eEF1B /eEF1A complex. Introduction Translation initiation is a crucial stage for the control of protein expression in cell development, differentiation, and apoptosis. In eukaryotes, translation initiation is regulated mainly by the various specific interactions among eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), mRNA, and the ribosome (Hershey and Merrick, 2000). Aminoacylated initiator methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNA iMet) is recruited to the 40S ribosomal subunit by eIF2, which consists of , , and subunits. Previous studies have shown that binding of Met-tRNA iMet to eIF2 primarily involves the subunit (Erickson and Hannig, 1996). eIF2 is a guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) sharing sequence and structural similarities with both the prokaryotic elongation factor EF1A (formerly called EF-Tu) and the eukaryotic elongation factor eEF1A (Schmitt et al., 2002). Like the GTP-bound EF1A and eEF1A, which bind aminoacylated tRNA (aa-tRNA), the GTP-bound eIF2 forms a stable ternary complex with Met-tRNAiMet (Gaspar et al., 1994). After the establishment of the interaction between the anticodon in Met-tRNA iMet and the AUG start codon on the 40S ribosome, hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP is stimulated by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF5, and the eIF2-GDP complex is released from the ribosome, followed by joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit. The subunit of eIF2 contains lysine blocks near the N termi*Correspondence: wagner@hms.harvard.edu

Results and Discussion Structure Determination of heIF2 by NMR In order to solve the structure of heIF2 , we planned to produce isotope-labeled protein in E. coli expression systems. However, very low expression levels were encountered for wild-type heIF2 , and the expressed protein was soluble only up to 0.05 mM concentrations. This was sufficient for recording a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum but did not allow for assignments and structure determination. To overcome this problem, we pursued the follow-

ing steps: First, we produced an artificial gene optimized for E. coli codon usage in order to boost the expression level. Second, we introduced a helper plasmid for chaperone coexpression, which dramatically increased the fraction of correctly folded and soluble protein. Third, to increase the solubility of the expressed protein, we introduced hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic mutations for nonconserved residues we guessed to be on the protein surface and functionally unimportant. This procedure allowed us to produce from a 1 liter expression volume a 0.5 mM sample that is well behaved and stable (Ito and Wagner, 2004). The resulting expression-improved and solubility-enhanced mutant, named se-heIF2 , comprises residues Ser4 to Asp302 and contains three mutations, A27Q, L46H, and V71K, as shown in Figure 1. The 1 H-15N HSQC spectra of a wild-type heIF2 and a seheIF2 were similar, which indicated that the solubilityenhancing mutations did not change the tertiary structure (Ito and Wagner, 2004). Thus, we decided to use se-heIF2 to determine the tertiary structure. We use the word heIF2 , instead of se-heIF2 , generally during discussion of the structure, except when a distinction is necessary. Since the molecular weight of se-heIF2 is more than 35 kDa and relatively large for the NMR study, a 2H/13C/ 15 N-labeled sample was required to record high-quality TROSY-based NMR spectra for backbone assignment (Salzmann et al., 1998). In order to obtain distance restraints from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), a U-2H-/U-12C-/ U-15N-/ILV-methyl-1H,13C-/FY-1H-labeled sample (ILVFYsample) was prepared, which has a 2H/12C/15N-labeled background but contains 1H,13C-labeled methyl groups at the positions 1 in isoleucine, 1 and 2 in leucine, and 1 and 2 in valine, and protonated phenylalanines and tyrosines (Gross et al., 2003; Hajduk et al., 2000). The "ILVFY-sample" made it possible to record various NOESY spectra at high sensitivity for measuring NOE cross peaks between protons in amide, ILV-methyl, and FY-aromatic groups. The large number of NOEs identified this way, together with other conventional NMRderived and statistics-based restraints, were sufficient to calculate a tertiary structure of heIF2 . While proceeding with the structure determination, it became obvious that heIF2 consists of two independently moving globular domains. This became evident because no long-range NOEs were observed between the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 4­184) and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 185­302). Thus, we designed expression systems for the two putative domains, N-se-heIF2 and C-heIF2 . Both domains expressed well and exhibited good 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The spectra of the isolated domains were nearly identical to those in the full-length construct, which indicated that both domains are folded alone and adopt the same conformation as in the context of the entire heIF2 (see below). Since the NOE-derived distance restraints between amide, and protons in NTD were obtained easily using 2D NOESY, 3D 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, and 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra of N-se-heIF2 , we adopted these restraints for the calculations of the structure of full-length heIF2 . To obtain a more precise structure, we assigned most of the side chain resonances in the CTD by conventional methods and ob-

tained distance restraints from 2D NOESY, 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra of C-heIF2 . The final ensembles of structures for NTD and CTD are shown in Figures 2A and 2B, respectively, and a ribbon model of heIF2 is depicted in Figure 2C. Statistics for the final structures are shown in Table 1. Backbone rmsds of the refined regions in NTD (residues 6­47 and 62­184) and CTD (residues 187­277) are ° ° 1.23 A and 0.58 A, respectively. heIF2 Consists of Two Globular Domains that Are Mobile Relative to Each Other Primary sequences of eIF2 from several representative species are aligned in Figure 1. Amino acid residues between Arg6 and Glu273 are highly conserved among all species including archaea (no homolog is known for eubacteria). The lowest sequence conservation is found for some loops and terminal regions of helices. This fact strongly suggests that the tertiary structure of eIF2 is conserved among all species. As mentioned above, the calculated heIF2 NMR structure revealed that it consists of two domains, NTD and CTD, and a C-terminal tail found only in eukaryotes. Figure 3A is an overlay of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of N-se-heIF2 (blue) and C-heIF2 (red), and Figure 3B shows 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of se-heIF2 . Except for the line widths and the positions of some peaks at the domain boundary, the vast majority of peaks in Figure 3A are identical to those in Figure 3B. We also performed a mixing experiment, recording 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled N-se-heIF2 / C-heIF2 in the presence or absence of unlabeled C-heIF2 /N-se-heIF2 . The recorded HSQC spectra showed no difference between the presence and the absence of the other domain (data not shown). These results indicate that the NTD and CTD are folded by themselves, adopt the same conformation as in fulllength heIF2 , have little interdomain contact, and are mobile with respect to each other. These findings are consistent with the fact that only the NTD was crystallized after proteolysis from the full-length heIF2 (Dhaliwal and Hoffman, 2003; Nonato et al., 2002). It is likely that the relative orientation of the two domains will be fixed or restricted in the context of trimeric eIF2 and/ or in the ternary complex of eIF2 with GTP and MettRNA iMet. The N-Terminal Domain Consists of Two Subdomains: S1 Subdomain and -Helical Subdomain The NTD consists of two subdomains, S1 subdomain (residues 15­85) and -helical subdomain (residues 91­ 183), and the NMR structure of the NTD agreed almost completely with the recently determined crystal structure of the NTD of heIF2 (Nonato et al., 2002). The S1 subdomain consists of a five-stranded -barrel and adopts the so-called OB fold that was originally identified in the ribosomal protein S1 (Arcus, 2002). Strands 3 and 4 are connected by a long loop (the 3/ 4 loop) that contains two 310 helices, 310A (residues 47­50) and 310B (residues 58­61) (Figures 2A and 2C). In many other OB folds, this loop contains a single helix. The phosphorylation site, Ser51, is located just after helix 310A in the

3/ 4 loop. In the crystal structure, the electron density of the residues between Ser51 and Ile62 was missing (Nonato et al., 2002). This could be because the heIF2 3/ 4 loop is more mobile than the rest of the NTD. The crystal structure of the NTD from S. cerevisiae eIF2 was also determined very recently (Dhaliwal and Hoffman, 2003), and in that structure the backbone electron density in the 3/ 4 loop was visible. Interestingly, the 3/ 4 loop in the S. cerevisiae crystal structure also possesses

two 310 helices at the N and C-terminal ends, which are very similar to those in the NMR structure of heIF2 . The primary sequences in the 3/ 4 loop are highly conserved among eukaryotes as shown in Figure 1. Thus, the 3/ 4 loop structure may be conserved among eukaryotes. In addition, the recognition mechanism of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Ser51 by eIF2-kinases or eIF2B might also be conserved. The side chains of the three mutated residues, Glu27, His46, and Lys71, are solvent exposed and do not form structurally important contacts with other side chains as we had expected. The -helical subdomain consists of five helices (helices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and one 310 helix (helix 310C) packing together compactly. There is an aromatic hydrophobic core between the S1 and -helical subdomains, consisting of Phe7, Tyr8, Tyr38, Phe101, Tyr108, Phe130, and Trp135 (Figure 4). This group of residues appears to be one of the forces stabilizing the interaction between the S1 and -helical subdomains in the NTD. In the crystal structure of the human NTD, Cys69 from strand 4 in the S1 subdomain and Cys97 from helix 1 in the -helical subdomain are linked by a disulfide bond (Nonato et al., 2002). Since the NMR buffer contains 10 mM dithiothreitol, this bond was not detected in the NMR sample protein, which was indicated by the C chemical shift value of Cys69 (not detected for Cys97). Because the redox potential of the cytoplasm provides reducing conditions and the cysteine residues above are not highly conserved among eIF2 s, the disulfide bond in the crystal structure may have been formed during the crystallization under nonphysiological oxidizing condition. The distance between the S atoms of ° the two cysteines is 6.64 1.84 A, which is inconsistent with the existence of a disulfide bond. In the yeast system, the gene encoding eIF2 is known as SUI2 (suppressor of initiator codon mutations 2 ). Previous studies have shown that subunit-deleted eIF2 has defects in eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and Met-tRNA iMet binding (Nika et al., 2001) and is lethal in

yeast. However, this lethality is suppressed by overexpression of the and subunits of eIF2 and tRNA iMet (Erickson et al., 2001). Recently, Yatime and colleagues showed that in the archaeal system the S1 subdomain in the NTD binds RNA nonspecifically, and the CTD stabilizes binding of eIF2 to Met-tRNA iMet (Yatime et al., 2004), which is consistent with the previously proposed models that eIF2 plays a role in binding to Met-tRNA iMet and the 40S ribosomal subunit. Two sui2 suppressor mutants, which allow more frequent recognition of UUG as a start codon, were isolated by Cigan et al. (1989). One contains the mutation P13S and the other V19F, and their positions in the primary sequence are indicated by red open squares in Figure 1. These residues are conserved in most eIF2 s, including the human protein. The authors reported decreased levels of eIF2 in the mutant strains, indicating a defect in folding and/or stability. Interestingly, the two mutation positions are close to each other in the tertiary structure (shown in red in Figure 4). Pro13 and Val19 are located in the turn prior to strand 1 and at the second residue of strand 1, respectively. We tried to examine whether the P13S and V19F mutants of eIF2 still have the same tertiary structure as wild-type eIF2 by NMR. The bacterially overexpressed mutant NTDs were found only in the insoluble phase, and we could not purify them (data not shown). Since the mutation positions are close to the interface between the S1 and the -helical subdomains, it is likely that these mutations induce exposure of residues from the hydrophobic core between the subdomains on the surface and destabilize the NTD structure, which could be responsible for the suppressor activity. The C-Terminal Domain Adopts an -Fold The CTD contains five strands (strands 6­ 10), two helices (helices 6 and 7), and one loosely associated C-terminal helix 8 that has no well-defined orientation relative to the CTD or the NTD (Figures 2B and 2C). The five strands form a single antiparallel sheet that forms a contiguous surface area. The strands are ar-

ranged in the order 7, 8, 6, and 9/ 10. Strands 9 and 10 both pair with 6 but are interrupted by a bulge containing residues Glu271­Pro274. Helices 6 (204­ 216) and 7 (243­262) connect strands 6 with 7, and 8 with 9, respectively. Both helices are positioned on one side of the sheet. The hydrophobic residues located between the sheet and the helices in the CTD are relatively well conserved among all species (see yellow areas in Figure 1). The C-terminal segment following Thr280 has no fixed orientation relative to the CTD, but sequential and medium-range NOEs indicate that it contains a single helical structure, 8. The latter has no apparent amphipatic character. The C-terminal region after about Pro274 is only found in eukaryotes and contains many negatively charged residues (Figure 1). These residues may be relevant for an interaction with a positively charged molecular surface, such as formed by Arg/Lys-rich regions found in several eIFs, including eIF2 . Negative charges may also be important for directing this flexible region away from RNA and making them available for protein-protein interactions. S51D Mutation Has Little Effect on the eIF2 Structure Several reports have shown that the phosphomimetic mutant, S51D, has a similar function as phosphorylated eIF2 in terms of inhibition of guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B (Sudhakar et al., 2000), formation of stress granules (Kedersha et al., 2002), or induction of apoptosis (Srivastava et al., 1998). Therefore, we decided to analyze this mutant by NMR. In Figure 5A, the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of se-heIF2 (black) and S51Dse-heIF2 (red) are overlaid. Although most of the peaks were not affected by the S51D mutation, some peaks moved, such as His46 or Ser48. The combined chemical shift differences of the amide groups were calculated (Figure 5B) and mapped onto the tertiary structure (Figure 5C). Residues that differ by more than 0.1 ppm are found only near residue 51, and the biggest difference is only about 0.25 ppm for S48. This fact strongly sug-

The chemical shift differences between se-heIF2 and S51D-se-heIF2 are combined as [( 1HN)2 ( 15N/5)2]1/2. The residue numbers whose chemical shift difference is more than 0.1 ppm are shown in the figure. (C) The ribbon model of heIF2 is colored according to the combined chemical shift differences. The mutated S51 is colored in magenta. The residues which have differences of more than 0.2 ppm, between 0.2 and 0.1 ppm, and between 0.1 and 0.05 ppm are colored in red, orange, and green, respectively. The residues with differences less than 0.05 ppm are colored in gray, and the undetected and proline residues are colored in white.

gests that the S51D mutation introduces only a minimal conformation change at the backbone level. Although it is possible that phosphorylation of eIF2 has an effect different from the S51D mutation, it seems unlikely that the reason for the enhanced affinity to eIF2B is found in the conformation of free eIF2 . It is more likely that phosphorylated eIF2 and possibly the S51D mutant engage in tighter binding with eIF2B due to a better surface complementarity and/or more favorable electrostatic interactions.

The CTDs of eIF2 and eEF1B Have Similar Tertiary Structures Unexpectedly, the structure of the CTD in heIF2 was found very similar to that of the CTD of eEF1B , even though there is no detectable sequence homology (Figures 1, 6A, and 6B). Both domains have exactly the ° same topology, , 2.9 A rmsd for 77 C atoms compared, DALI Z score of 6.5 (scores 2.0 are statistically significant), and similar molecular shapes and surfaces. The CTD of eEF1B alone can function as a GEF

for the G protein eEF1A, which is structurally and functionally homologous to bacterial EF1A and the subunit of eIF2 (eIF2 ). The G proteins of the eEF1A and EF1A family consist of three domains: the G domain (also called domain I), domain II, and domain III. The G domain can bind a GDP or a GTP molecule. GTP-loaded eEF1A can bind aa-tRNA (ternary complex) and transfers it to the A site on the ribosome. The complex structure of yeast eEF1B CTD:eEF1A:GDP has been solved and is shown in Figure 6B (Andersen et al., 2001). The crystal structure of archaeal eIF2 from Pyrococcus abyssi has been solved (shown in Figure 6A), and it adopts a structure similar to eEF1A or EF1A, as expected from their sequence homology (Schmitt et al., 2002). eIF2 , the largest subunit of eIF2, is also a G protein and able to bind to Met-tRNA iMet with eIF2 , eIF2 , and GTP. The tertiary structures of all three domains in eIF2 and eEF1A are very similar to each other, while the orientation between the G domain and domains II and III is slightly different (Roll-Mecak et al., 2003; Schmitt et al., 2002). The G domain of archaeal eIF2 is rotated toward domain II by about 30 , compared to the G domain of eEF1A in the eEF1B CTD:eEF1A structure. Although it is known that eIF2 and eIF2 can form a stable dimer (Oldfield and Proud, 1992; Schmitt et al., 2002), the interaction interface is not known. It is easy to realize that if two pairs of structurally homologous partners, like eEF1A:eEF1B and eIF2 :eIF2 , interact, they are likely to use the same binding interface. Since the subunit in eIF2B has been identified as a catalytic subunit of GEF for eIF2 (Gomez et al., 2002; Gomez and Pavitt, 2000), the functional relationship between eIF2 and eIF2 appears to be different from that between eEF1B and eEF1A. However, the structural homology revealed here strongly suggests that the binding mode between eEF1B and eEF1A could be similar to that between eIF2 and eIF2 , using a homologous interface on domain II and possibly the G domain (marked with a dashed ellipse in Figure 6A). This model is also supported by the fact that the hypothetical eIF2 binding surface of the eIF2 -CTD shows much higher sequence conservation than the rest of the CTD, as shown in yellow in Figure 6C. In order to examine the interaction between heIF2 and heIF2 in vitro, we prepared recombinant heIF2 either as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein (Amersham) or a streptococcal protein G B1 domain-fusion protein (Zhou et al., 2001) in an Escherichia coli expression system. Some of the protein was expressed in the soluble phase. However, we could not detect binding between heIF2 and heIF2 by pull-down assays (data not shown), either because the recombinant heIF2 protein is not functional or other components are needed for binding, such as Met-tRNAi or eIF2 . Recently, RollMecak and colleagues showed that residues around Leu256 and Asp325 in domain II of M. jannaschii archaeal eIF2 are responsible for binding to archaeal eIF2 (the corresponding residues, Leu229 and Asp298, in Pyrococcus abyssi archaeal eIF2 are shown in red in Figure 6A) (Roll-Mecak et al., 2003). These residues in eIF2 are located in the hypothetical interaction surface with eIF2 -CTD and could be interacting with residues around the N terminus of strand 9 and the loop

between strand 6 and helix 6 in eIF2 (the region circled with cyan in Figure 6A). According to the proposed interaction mode between eIF2 -CTD and eIF2 , the NTD of eIF2 may be located close to the G domain of eIF2 . This is consistent with the previously proposed model that eIF2 works as a regulatory subunit in eIF2, where the phosphorylation state of Ser51 in the NTD controls binding to the GEF eIF2B (Hinnebusch, 2000). In further support of the model presented here for the interaction between eIF2 and , it was recently reported that the CTD of archaeal eIF2 is necessary and sufficient for both binding to eIF2 and for stabilization of MettRNA iMet binding to eIF2 (Yatime et al., 2004). The archaeal eIF2 possesses a zinc knuckle structure in the G domain (Schmitt et al., 2002), and the bound zinc ion is shown by an orange ball in Figure 6A. This structure had not been identified in the other EF1A-like proteins. Since it is located near the currently proposed eIF2 binding region, it might also interact with eIF2 . However, the primary sequences around the knuckle structure are less conserved than the other region in eIF2 . In addition, the four cysteines forming a zinc binding pocket in archaeal eIF2 are not conserved in the higher eukaryotes. In the case of the human eIF2 , three of the four cysteins are replaced by one leucine and two threonines. Thus, it is unclear if the same knuckle structure as the archaeal eIF2 still exists in the higher eukaryotic eIF2 s.

A Possible Mechanism for the Function of the eIF2 CTD in eIF2 A key residue for the guanine-nucleotide exchange activity of eEF1B is Lys205 (indicated by a green filled circle in Figure 1), which inserts into the Mg2 and GDP/ GTP binding pocket of eEF1A (Figure 6B) (Andersen et al., 2001). In yeast, the K205A mutation in eEF1B is lethal, very likely because of the defect of GTP/GDP exchange on eEF1A. In the proposed model for the eIF2 /eIF2 interaction, the CTD of eIF2 might come close to the Mg2 and GDP/GTP binding pocket of eIF2 . Interestingly, Arg243 and/or Lys275 in the CTD of heIF2 are located at a similar site as Lys205 in eEF1B (Figure 6A). These positions are occupied by basic residues in other eukaryotic eIF2 s (indicated by green open circles in Figure 1). In eukaryotes, eIF2B is known to act as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2, but the precise molecular mechanism of its function has not been elucidated. Thus, it is interesting to examine whether Arg243 or Lys275 in eIF2 plays any role in the guaninenucleotide exchange reaction for eIF2 . In archaeal eIF2 s, there is a conserved lysine at the human position 244, and a conserved basic residue is found at the human position 272. These positions are labeled with green open stars in Figure 1. According to the proposed model for the eIF2 /eIF2 interaction, the side chains of these residues in archaeal eIF2 may come close to the Mg2 and GDP/GTP binding pocket of archaeal eIF2 . Since archaea do not have an eIF2B homolog, one of these residues may function in stimulating guanine-nucleotide exchange of archaeal eIF2. An interesting structural difference between eIF2 and eEF1B was found for the length of strands 7 and

Structure 1702

8, which in eIF2 are shorter than the corresponding strands in eEF1B (shown with magenta in Figures 6A and 6B). It is known that eEF1A is not able to bind both eEF1B and aa-tRNA simultaneously. The eEF1A:eEF1B complex structure and the mutant analysis suggested that Phe163 in eEF1B mimics the adenine base of the CCA end in the aa-tRNA and occupies the adenine binding pocket in eEF1A (shown with red in Figure 6B) (Andersen et al., 2000). If the eEF1B strands corresponding to strands 7 and 8 in eIF2 were as short as those in eIF2 , a space could be created for eEF1A to interact with aa-tRNA in the presence of eEF1B . This logic might explain why the GTP-bound eIF2 is able to bind eIF2 and Met-tRNA iMet simultaneously. This hypothesis is supported by the genetic and biochemical assays by Roll-Mecak and colleagues showing that the eIF2 mutation around the putative adenine binding pocket (Gly319 and Arg242 in M. jann. eIF2 ) affected binding to Met-tRNA iMet, but not binding to eIF2 (Roll-Mecak et al., 2003). Consistently with this, a previous study had shown that eIF2 plays a role in binding to Met-tRNA iMet (Nika et al., 2001). Our current results suggest that the CTD of eIF2 may be responsible for this function, stabilizing the interaction between eIF2 and Met-tRNA iMet. This is supported by the very recent study showing that the eIF2 -CTD is responsible for binding eIF2 , and these two components are sufficient for binding MettRNA iMet in the archaeal system (Yatime et al., 2004). The high degree of structural similarity between archaeal eIF2 and EF1A allowed modeling of the interaction of eIF2 with Met-tRNA iMet, based on the structure of the ternary complex EF1A:GDPNP:Phe-tRNAPhe (Nissen et al., 1995; Roll-Mecak et al., 2003; Schmitt et al., 2002). This model of the complex is further supported by sitedirected mutagenesis studies of eIF2 (Roll-Mecak et al., 2003; Yatime et al., 2004). According to our model for the eIF2 -eIF2 interaction, eIF2 would "line" the Met-tRNA iMet binding pocket on domain II of eIF2 and come in close proximity to the tip of Met-tRNA iMet. To test this model, we performed direct NMR titration experiments of 15N-labeled eIF2 -CTD with unmodified and uncharged initiator tRNA iMet. No spectral changes were detected in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of eIF2 -CTD upon addition of tRNAiMet (data not shown). This is in contrast to biochemical data in archaea, where eIF2 -CTD was reported to bind RNA nonspecifically (Yatime et al., 2004). This suggests that in eukaryotes both eIF2 and eIF2 are needed for tight binding Met-tRNA iMet. A model of the complex between the CTD of eIF2 , eIF2 , and Met-tRNA iMet that is consistent with the data discussed above is shown in Figure 6C. This could provide an explanation for the observed stabilization by eIF2 of Met-tRNA iMet binding to eIF2 (Yatime et al., 2004). By promoting tight binding of Met-tRNA iMet to eIF2 , eIF2 indirectly provides extra protection of Met-tRNA iMet from deacylation (Yatime et al., 2004). It is also possible that eIF2 directly contributes to protection of Met-tRNA iMet in the bound state. The work presented here showed that heIF2 consists of two domains that are mobile relative to each other. The loop around Ser51, which is the target of regulatory kinases, is relatively mobile in solution. The unexpected structural similarity of the eIF2 -CTD with the elongation

factor eEF1B -CTD suggests a model for the topology of association of eIF2 , eIF2 , and Met-tRNA iMet in the ternary complex. The geometry of the putative eIF2 / eIF2 interface suggests a possible role of eIF2 for the GDP/GTP exchange in eIF2 . This will stimulate further mechanistic studies, once difficulties of preparing folded and functional human eIF2 are overcome.
Experimental Procedures Sample Preparation Plasmid construction, protein expression, and purification for seheIF2 were performed as described (Ito and Wagner, 2004). For 2 H, 13C, or 15N-isotope labeling, 2H2O, [13C6]-D-glucose, or 15NH4Cl was used generally as an isotope source in M9 minimal medium. To obtain a FY-aromatic 1H-labeled sample (FY-sample), phenylalanine and tyrosine were added to M9 medium containing 2H2O, [2H7]D-glucose 30 min before the induction. To obtain an ILV-methyl specific 1H/13C-labeled sample (ILV-sample) for the chemical shift assignments, [U-13C4/3,3-2H2]- -ketobutyrate and [U-13C5/3-2H1]- -ketoisovalerate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) were added to M9 medium containing 2H2O, [U-13C6/U-2H7]-D-glucose and 15 NH4Cl 30 min before the induction (Goto et al., 1999). To obtain a U-2H-/U-15N-/ILV-methyl-1H,13C-/FY-1H-labeled sample (ILVFY-sample) for the various NOESY measurements, [ -13C1]- -ketobutyrate, [ , -13C2]- -ketoisovalerate, [15N]-phenylalanine, and [15N]-tyrosine were added 30 min before the induction to M9 medium containing 2 H2O, [2H7]-D-glucose, and 15NH4Cl (Gross et al., 2003; Hajduk et al., 2000). DNA fragments encoding N-terminal (4­185) and C-terminal (185­ 302) domains of se-heIF2 were inserted into pET-30a( ) plasmids, and the expressed proteins had a C-terminal His6-tag. The same protocol as for full-length se-heIF2 was used to purify overexpressed N-terminal and C-terminal domains of se-heIF2 (N-se-heIF2 and C-heIF2 ). The expression plasmids for S51D-se-heIF2 were prepared with the Quick-Change Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), and an NMR sample was prepared as for se-heIF2 . NMR Spectroscopy NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a CMR G 750 MHz, a Varian Inova 750 MHz, a Bruker Avance 600 MHz, a Bruker Avance 500 MHz, or a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. Some of the spectra were measured using a Bruker Cryoprobe or a Varian Coldprobe. NMR buffer conditions and the strategy for the backbone assignments of se-heIF2 were described elsewhere (Ito and Wagner, 2004), and all NMR measurements were performed under the same conditions. 3D TROSY-H(CCO)NH, 3D TROSY-C(CO)NH, and 3D HCCH-TOCSY spectra were measured to assign chemical shifts of ILV-methyl group with an ILV-sample (Hilty et al., 2002). In order to assign chemical shifts of aromatic protons in phenylalanine and tyrosine, 2D NOESY (75 ms mixing time) and 2D TOCSY (50 ms mixing time) were measured with a FY-sample in 2H2O ( 99.9%) NMR buffer. Chemical shifts of 15 valine and 19 leucine methyl groups were stereospecifically assigned by using a 15% 13C-labeled sample (Neri et al., 1989). To obtain distance restraints with se-heIF2 , 4D 13C/13C-edited HMQC-NOESY-HMQC, 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 3D 13C-edited HMQC-NOESY, 3D 13C/15N-edited HMQC-NOESY-HSQC, and 2D NOESY were measured with 200 ms mixing time using an ILVFYsample. The 13C dimension in all NOESY measurements was focused on the ILV-methyl region. 3D 13C-edited HMQC-NOESY and 2D NOESY were measured in 2H2O ( 99.9%) NMR buffer. 1 N 15 H , N, and 1H chemical shifts of N-se-heIF2 and C-heIF2 were assigned using 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (120 ms mixing time) and 3D 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC (38 ms mixing time) measured with 15N-labeled samples, and using 2D NOESY (100 ms mixing time) and 2D TOCSY (43 ms mixing time) measured with nonlabeled samples in 2H2O ( 99.9%) NMR buffer. In order to assign other chemical shifts of side chains in C-heIF2 , 3D HNCA, 3D H(CCO)NH, 3D C(CO)NH, 3D HCCH-TOCSY, 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC were measured using a 13C/15N-labeled sample. To assign backbone chemical shifts of S51D-se-heIF2 , 3D

TROSY-HNCA, 3D TROSY-HN(CO)CA, 3D TROSY-HNCO, and 3D TROSY-HN(CA)CO were measured with a 2H/13C/15N-labeled sample. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) and analyzed with NMRView (Johnson and Blevins, 1994).

Structure Calculation A summary of NMR-derived restrains and structures is shown in Table 1. Distance restraints were obtained from the NOESY spectra shown above. Since most of the backbone chemical shifts from N-se-heIF2 and C-heIF2 are the same as those from the fulllength se-heIF2 except for the domain boundary region, distance restraints derived from 2D NOESY, 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (only for C-heIF2 ) spectra of N-se-heIF2 and C-heIF2 were also incorporated to calculate the structure of the full-length se-heIF2 . Backbone  and dihedral angle restraints were obtained from TALOS program (Cornilescu et al., 1999). Hydrogen bond restraints were based on 1H2O/2H2O exchange experiments and NOE analysis and incorporated as two distance restraints per bond. Initial structure calculations were performed using CYANA (Guntert et al., 1997), and final structure calculations by simulated annealing methods (Nilges et al., 1988) were performed using NIH-XPLOR (Brunger, 1992). A conformational database potential was utilized during the calculation (Kuszewski et al., 1997). 50,000 simulated annealing steps of 0.005 ps at 3,000 K were run followed by a cooling phase of 70,000 steps of 0.003 ps to 100 K. The values for the final ° force constants were as follows: NOE restraints, 50 kcal/mol·A2; dihedral angle restraints, 200 kcal/mol·rad2; 13C chemical shift restraints, 0.5 kcal/mol·ppm2; scale factor for conformational database restraints, 1.0. Ninety-four structures were calculated, and 15 lowest-energy structures satisfying distance and dihedral angle restraints were selected.

Model Construction The structures of all three domains of EF1A, eEF1A, and eIF2 are ° almost superimposable (with rmsds 2 A). The orientation between domains II and III is also identical. The main difference is the orientation of the G domain with respect to domains II and III: in eIF2 it is rotated toward domain II by 30 compared to the G domain of eEF1A in the eEF1B -CTD:eEF1A complex, and 15 compared to the G domain of EF1A:GTP (Schmitt et al., 2002). The rmsd between ° eIF2 -CTD and eEF1B -CTD is 2.9 A (see Results and Discussion above). The binding of eIF2 to Met-tRNA i is modeled as in Roll-Mecak et al. (2003) and Schmitt et al. (2002): domain II of eIF2 was aligned to domain II of EF1A (EF-Tu) from a ternary complex with GTP and Cys-tRNACys, PDB code 1B23, and the resulting orientation between eIF2 and the tRNA was not further modified. The Cys residue attached to the tRNA was replaced by Met. To model the interaction of eIF2 with eIF2 , domain II of eIF2 was aligned to domain II of eEF1A, and eIF2 -CTD was aligned to eEF1B -CTD from the eEF1A:eEF1B complex, PDB code 1G7C. eIF2 -CTD was then manually rotated around the proposed eIF2 domain II interacting surface (rotation of the "bottom" end of eIF2 -CTD to the left in the orientation in Figure 6C) in order to compensate for the different relative orientations of G domain and domain II in eIF2 and eEF1A (see above) and to obtain better surface complementarity.
