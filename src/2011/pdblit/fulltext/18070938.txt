SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA constructs, protein expression, and purification. Biotin-tagged hCCL2 (M64I) and hCXCL10 for cell staining were cloned into a customized pET28 vector, which was engineered to include a thrombin cleavage site, a BirA recognition sequence, and a 6-His tag at the C terminus with the sequence GSLVPRGSLNDIFEAQKIEWHERLEHHHHHH. After expression at 37°C in BL21-Codon plus (RIL) E. coli (Stratagene), inclusion bodies were harvested, washed as previously described (1), and dissolved in 6 M guanidine. The proteins were renatured by 10-fold dilution into 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 5 mM EDTA, 10mM PMSF, and 1 mM of oxidized and 10 mM of reduced glutathione, with stirring overnight at 4°C. The refolding reactions were exchanged into 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) before ion exchange on SP sepharose using a 0­1-M NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Human CCL2 used in SPR analysis was released from the tag by thrombin cleavage and purified by Ni-NTA to remove the cleaved tag (QIAGEN). The resulting protein was homogeneous by electrospray mass spectrometry, yielding a molecular mass of 8,619 D corresponding to the sequence G1QPD...TPK70. Human CXCL10 and biotinylated heparin (mean molecular mass 15 kD) used in SPR experiments were purchased from Invitrogen and EMD, respectively.

x-ray crystallography. Crystals of the M3­CCL2 and M3­XCL1 complexes were formed by hanging drop vapor diffusion using 1 ml of protein (at 15 mg/ml) and 1 ml of precipitant that consisted of 12% PEG-4000, 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.1), 200 mM MgCl2 (M3­CCL2) and 10% PEG-8000, and 100 mM Tris (pH 6.1; M3­XCL1). For data collection, crystals were cryopreserved in precipitant solution containing 20% ethylene glycol and flash cooled at 100 degrees Kelvin. SPR experiments. All experiments were conducted at 25°C under conditions of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% Triton X-100, unless otherwise indicated. For M3­chemokine interaction analysis, M3 variants were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.1) using standard amine coupling. A control cell was treated in the same manner using coupling buffer alone. Identical results were obtained using other immobilization methods, such as neutravidin capture of N-terminal biotinylated M3 protein. Sensorgrams for M3­chemokine binding were influenced by mass-transport effects at low salt (£500 mM) and were completely dominated by transport at 150 mM NaCl, as indicated by a linear rather than exponential association phase and an artificially extended dissociation phase. Mass transport effects indicate that the SPR signal is not simply explained by the chemical reaction at the surface but is also a function of the transport rate (kt) for analyte delivery. Transport-limited SPR data have been successfully analyzed using two-compartment models that account for transport, which has extended the upper range of on rates that may be obtained by this method (2, 3). M3­XCL1 binding kinetics were measured as a function of NaCl to analyze the salt dependence of this interaction and were run in standard Hepes running buffer with NaCl from 200 mM to 1.5 M. M3 was immobilized to levels of 300, 400, and 570 RU. 2­100 nM XCL1 was injected over the flow cells at 80 ml/min, and the surface was regenerated with 500 mM CaCl2. Data were analyzed in BIAevaluation software (version 3.1; Biacore), using a 1:1 interaction model for 0.6­1.5 M NaCl and using a two-compartment 1:1 mass transport model for 0.2­0.5 M NaCl with a fixed kt = 1.75 × 108 s1. The kinetic constants kaapp and kdapp were determined from the fit to the sensorgrams, and the KD was independently determined from the ratio KD = kdapp/kaapp and by a nonlinear fit to the Req values (KD(eq)), as appropriate. Experiments were repeated in triplicate, and constants were averaged for all three immobilization levels. Salt-dependent binding experiments were also repeated in a separate experiment for a series of three ionic strengths using either NaCl or MgCl2 to test whether the affinity varied for different salts. Data analysis was conducted as described, and KD(eq) was reported under both conditions for comparison. To measure binding constants for M3BBXB at 150 mM NaCl, the mutant was immobilized to a level of 800 RU, and 20­600 nM XCL1 was injected over the chip at 40 ml/min. Kinetic and equilibrium constants were obtained using a 1:1 interaction model, and a relatively small (twofold) difference between equilibrium and kinetic-derived values supports the use of this model. However, a deviation between these values might be explained by more complex binding kinetics or inhomogeneous coupling to the chip. To measure wild-type M3­XCL1 affinity at 150 mM NaCl by competition, 20 nM XCL1 was preequilibrated with 0­60 nM M3 and injected in the same manner. To measure chemokine binding to heparin and M3 competition, heparin sensor chips were prepared by neutravidin capture of biotinylated heparin. Neutravidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was coupled to a CM5 chip in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5) using standard amine chemistry. 15-kD heparin-biotin was injected at 5 mg/ml in Hepes running buffer with 300 mM NaCl and bound to a level of 150­300 RU. A flow cell coupled with neutravidin alone was used as a control. Chemokines were injected over the heparin chip at 20 ml/min (CCL2) and 80 ml/min (XCL1 and CXCL10) to measure heparin binding, and the surface was regenerated using 1 M NaCl. The Req values (end of the association phase) were analyzed to determine KD for each chemokine. For CCL2 and CXCL10, a 1:1 interaction model was used to fit the data, but for XCL1, marked positive cooperaJEM © The Rockefeller University Press

tivity was apparent; therefore, a cooperative oligomerization model previously described for RANTES binding to heparin (4) was used to estimate the KD. M3 competition assays were performed as follows. 2.3 mM CCL2, 84 nM hCXCL10, and 120 nM XCL1 were preequilibrated with M3 over a range of 0.2­3 mM, 5­125 nM, and 0­220 nM, respectively. Each were injected over the heparin chip in the same manner as for chemokine alone. Electrostatic calculations. The program APBS was used to calculate potential maps and electrostatic interaction energies (DGelec) (5). PQR and APBS input files were generated using PDB2PQR (agave.wustl.edu) with PARSE partial charges. The linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved for the M3­XCL1 complex and individual components at several ionic strengths using the automated multigrid method (solvent dielectric = 80, protein dielectric = 12, temperature = 298 degrees Kelvin). The solvent radius was set to 0 (van der Waals surface) for the molecular surface calculation. The electrostatic interaction energy (DGelec) was calculated by subtracting the calculated PB energies of the individual components from the complex (Fig. S1 and Table S1). Experimental determination of isoelectric points. For determination of experimental isoelectric points, samples containing 1 mg/ml M3, M3BBXB, and M3 were premixed at a 1:1 molar ratio with chemokines. The complexes were then run on a Novex isoelectric focusing gel (pH 3­10), according to standard protocol (Invitrogen), and visualized using Coomassie blue staining (Fig. S1). The chemokines XCL1 and CCL2 were also analyzed but were found to completely run off the gel (caused by pI > 9.5; not depicted).

Electrostatic analysis of kinetics. Several protein­protein and protein­nucleic acid interactions exhibit salt-dependent kinetics, which have previously been analyzed according to the Debye-Huckel theory (6, 7), as well as theories based on specific protein­ion binding (8). Both of these approaches were considered during analysis of the salt dependence of M3­XCL1 binding kinetics. The kinetic data were modeled using the Debye-Huckel theory similar to a previous study (7). This method assumes that a trend in ka with increasing NaCl is purely an ionic strength effect in which bulk ions in solution shield electrostatic interactions between proteins, and does not account for specific protein­ion interactions. For the Debye-Huckel electrostatic analysis, ln(ka) is plotted versus 1/1 + ka (where k2 (Å2) is 0.108 times the ionic strength (M) at 298 K [9], using a = 5.6 Å as the minimal distance of approach [6]), and fit according to the following equation (7):  -Gelec   e - ( r - a )  ln ka = ln ka0 +   RT   1 + a

where m is ion concentration in moles per liter and z is the valence.

The ka is a function of the basal on rate k0a in the absence of electrostatic enhancement and the electrostatic interaction energy (DGelec), which decreases with increasing ionic strength according to e - ( r - a ) /(1 + a ) , where r is set equal to a, as described previously (7). A plot of ln(ka) versus 1/1 + ka was approximately linear over the entire range of salt concentration studied (Fig. S1). Therefore, a linear fit to this plot was extrapolated to yield an estimate for the M3­XCL1 kaapp at 150 mM NaCl of 108 M1s1. The Debye-Huckel analysis described was conducted to estimate the M3­XCL1 association rate at salt concentrations that could not be obtained experimentally. However, a trend in on rate as a function of salt may also reflect competing processes such as specific ion binding to either protein (8). To test whether specific protein­ion binding may contribute to the on rate trend observed, measurements were conducted under the same ionic strength using either NaCl or MgCl2. The results show small differences in affinity (less than twofold) for the two salts at each concentration tested, indicating that some degree of specific protein­ion binding may occur in this system (Fig. S1 and Table S1). This result suggests that the trend in M3­XCL1 on rate may not be fully described by the shielding of electrostatic interactions from bulk ions in solution but may involve a more complex process in which bound ions are released from the protein surfaces upon M3­XCL1 binding. In either case, the results of these analyses clearly demonstrate the importance of electrostatics in the enhancement of M3­XCL1 interactions. SPR competition assay. Equations used to analyze competition titrations were derived as follows (Eqs. 1­6), assuming a 1:1 interaction for both the receptor on the chip and the solution competitor (A = total analyte, M = receptor on chip, M*=competitor in solution), and affinities for the chip-bound receptor and the solution-phase competitor denoted as KM and KM*, respectively: K  KM M M  A  M  + A + M  MA   The expression for analyte binding to the chip-bound receptor and the solution competitor are 1:1 Langmuir binding models (10): K M A free R MA (1)  = Rmax M tot 1 + K M A free K M  A free M A = (2)  1 + K M  A free M tot Total analyte is the sum of free, receptor-bound and competitor-bound analyte: Atot = A free + M  A + MA (3) Assuming that analyte is in large excess over the receptor on the chip, Atot simplifies to: Atot = A free + M  A (in the absence of M  , Atot = A free ) (4) Substituting Eq. 2 into Eq. 4 yields Eq. 5, which can be solved for free analyte to obtain an expression that describes free analyte concentration as a function of solution competitor:  K  A free   M Atot = A free +   M tot (5) 1 + K M  A free
