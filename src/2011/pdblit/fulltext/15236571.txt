ABSTRACT: Tetranectin is a homotrimeric protein containing a C-type lectin-like domain. This domain (TN3) can bind calcium, but in the absence of calcium, the domain binds a number of kringle-type protein ligands. Two of the calcium-coordinating residues are also critical for binding plasminogen kringle 4 (K4). The structure of the calcium free-form of TN3 (apoTN3) has been determined by NMR. Compared to the structure of the calcium-bound form of TN3 (holoTN3), the core region of secondary structural elements is conserved, while large displacements occur in the loops involved in calcium or K4 binding. A conserved proline, which was found to be in the cis conformation in holoTN3, is in apoTN3 predominantly in the trans conformation. Backbone dynamics indicate that, in apoTN3 especially, two of the three calcium-binding loops and two of the three K4-binding residues exhibit increased flexibility, whereas no such flexibility is observed in holoTN3. In the 20 best nuclear magnetic resonance structures of apoTN3, the residues critical for K4 binding span a large conformational space. Together with the relaxation data, this indicates that the K4-ligand-binding site in apoTN3 is not preformed.

Tetranectin (TN),1 a protein found in human (1) and several animal species, is expressed by many different cell types and is present in human serum at a concentration of 10 mg/L (2). Roles for TN have been reported in several types of cancer, where a higher level of TN in the blood is correlated with higher survival rates (3). In addition, TN has been shown to accumulate in the stroma of breast, ovarian (4), and colon (5) carcinomas and to colocalize with plasminogen at the invasive front of melanomas (6). Roles for TN have also been reported in myogenesis (7) and bone development (8, 9), and mice with a deletion of the TN gene exhibit a spinal deformity (10). These implications in development and diseases indicate a role for TN in processes involving tissue remodeling.

TN is a homotrimeric protein (11). An N-terminal short lysine-rich region binds complex-sulfated carbohydrates including heparin (12). This region is followed by an R-helix domain, responsible for the trimerisation (13, 14) of TN, and a C-terminal C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), which is encoded by the third exon of the TN gene and therefore is called TN3. TN3 can bind two calcium ions, such as many other CTLDs, but in the absence of calcium, TN3 can bind to the kringle 4 domain of plasminogen (Plg K4). The interaction between plasminogen and TN has been reported to facilitate the proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin (1). In TN3, two of the residues involved in the coordination of calcium are also critical for the binding of K4 (15). In Plg K4, three residues in the lysine-binding pocket and at least one residue not involved in lysine binding are critical for the interaction with TN3 (16). In addition to plasminogen, the kringle proteins apolipoprotein(a) (17, 18), hepatocyte growth factor, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (19) have also been reported to bind to TN. For the latter two, the interaction with TN has not been mapped in detail and sensitivity to inhibition by calcium was not reported; however, it must be assumed that binding is taking place through TN3. CTLDs are common modules found in extracellular animal proteins and are defined by sequential and structural homology to the subgroup defining the prototype, the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) of animal C-type lectins. The broader term CTLD is being used to comprise domains binding a variety of other ligands than just carbohydrates, including proteins and inorganic surfaces of ice or CaCO3

Structure of the Calcium-Free Form of TN3 (20). The general CTLD motif consists of a core of conserved secondary structural elements and a loop region, often binding calcium, where the most significant structural differences among CTLDs are found. The carbohydrate binding of CTLDs is located in the loop region, and several CTLDs, including TN3, bind other types of ligands to the same region. So far, TN3 represents the only example of a CTLD that is able to bind calcium but, in the absence of calcium, has the affinity to bind protein ligands. Understanding the conformational changes governing the binding of calcium or K4 by TN3 may therefore provide new insight into relationships between structure and function of CTLDs. A crystal structure of TN at 2.8 Å resolution (13) and a crystal structure of TN3 at 2.0 Å (21) have previously been reported. Both structures correspond to the holo form of TN with two calcium ions bound by the CTLD. To gain further insight into the interaction between TN and plasminogen, the present structure addresses the structure and dynamics of the calcium-free, K4-binding form of TN3. MATERIALS AND METHODS The rTN3 expression vector and the protocol for expression, refolding, and purification have been described earlier (11). Uniformly 13C/15N-labeled protein was produced by growing Escherichia coli BL21DE3pLys cells in M9 minimal medium with (15NH4)2SO4 and [13C6]-glucose as the sole sources for nitrogen and carbon. A protein concentration of 0.6 mM in 90% H2O/10% D2O containing 1 mM NaN3 at pH 6.7 was obtained using the Centricon YM-10 concentrating device (Millipore). The holoTN3 sample was prepared by adding CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mM. The NMR data were acquired at 298 K on a Varian Unity Inova 800 MHz instrument. Nearly complete backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained using the following standard experiments from the Varian Proteinpack: 15NHSQC, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, HCCH-TOCSY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 13C-edited NOESYHSQC. Relaxation data (T1 and T2) and heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOEs were acquired at 298 K on a Varian Unity Inova 750 MHz instrument. T1 and T2 values were determined from a nonlinear least-squares fit to an exponential curve of measured peak heights as a function of the delay. The {1H}15 N NOE saturation values were determined as the Isat/Iunsat ratio from two spectra recorded with and without proton saturation. All spectra were processed with NMRpipe (22) and analyzed with PRONTO (23). Resonance signals from the peptide backbone atoms were assigned with the aid of AUTOASSIGN (24). The residue numbering used corresponds to the numbering of full-length TN. The secondary structure and loop topology found in the crystal structure of holoTN3 (1TN3) has been used as a reference. The core region of TN3 refers to residues 69-114 and 154-179, which contain the secondary structural elements. All molecular graphic presentations were prepared using Molmol (25). RESULTS

The broader dispersion of holoTN3 and the slightly broader line width of apoTN3 indicate that the structure of holoTN3 is less dynamic than the structure of apoTN3.

mational differences exist between the two forms, because many nonoverlapping peaks can be observed (Figure 1). For holoTN3, the peaks are sharper than for apoTN3 and a slightly broader dispersion can be observed, indicating that the overall structure of holoTN3 is better defined as compared to that of apoTN3. In two differential scanning calorimetry experiments, the melting temperature was measured to 57 °C for apoTN3 and 68 °C for holoTN3 (data not shown). This demonstrates the stabilizing effect of the binding of calcium ions to TN3. Backbone and Side-Chain Assignments in ApoTN3. The TN3 construct corresponds to residues 45-181 of full-length TN. This comprises the CTLD (50-181) and five additional residues in the N terminal. For residues 64-181, nearly complete sequence-specific backbone and side-chain assignments could be obtained using 13C-/15N-labeled protein and standard triple-resonance experiments. For the residues Asn93, Thr122, Val124, Asn135, Ile180, and Val181, no NMR signals could be assigned for the backbone atoms. For residues 151-153, located at the end of loop 4, neither backbone nor side-chain resonances could be assigned. For all assigned residues, sequential backbone correlations and/ or sequential NOEs could be observed. Side-chain assignments were obtained from 15N-TOCSYHSQC and 13C-HCCH-TOCSY experiments. Aromatic rings, amide groups, and methionine methyl groups were assigned through NOEs from 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13CNOESY-HSQC experiments. Among the sequentially assigned residues, side-chain assignments for nonlabile protons are complete with the following exceptions: Thr86H ,H2, Leu96H, Trp136H1,H 3, Trp163H1, Arg167H , and Arg169H . Amide groups could be assigned for Gln88, Gln102, Asn106, Asn160, and Gln171. Indications of Disorder in the N Terminal of TN3. For residues 45-63, no NMR signals were observed, indicating line broadening from slow conformational exchange of the

Nielbo et al. Comparison of Chemical Shifts in Apo- and HoloTN3. To investigate differences in structural and dynamic properties between apo- and holoTN3, a backbone assignment of holoTN3 was performed. The assignment of holoTN3 generally confirms the assignment of apoTN3. As for apoTN3, the N-terminal 20 residues could not be assigned in holoTN3, and for those residues that have been assigned in both forms, only minor chemical-shift differences occur in large parts of the protein. The largest chemical-shift differences are located in three intervals corresponding to L1, from L3 through L4 into B3, and the end of B4. The intervals with the larger chemical-shift changes closely match the location of the calcium-binding residues (Figure 3), and if mapped on the structure of holoTN3, they form a contiguous region around the calcium ions (Figure 4). This indicates that the core secondary structure of apoTN3 is the same as in holoTN3 and that the major structural changes are restricted to the loop regions. NOE Assignment and Structure Calculations. For apoTN3, a complete structure determination was performed. Using the software Pronto (23), 9147 peaks from 15N-NOESYHSQC and 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra were interactively picked. The chemical-shift list, the unassigned peak lists, and the peak heights were used as input for CYANA (27, 28), which includes the CANDID protocol for automatic NOE assignment and structure calculation. As additional input, upper-distance limits for the disulfide bonds Cys77-Cys176 and Cys152-Cys168, the coordinates from the crystal structure of holoTN3 as the start structure, and initially 231 dihedral-angle constraints from TALOS (29) with a tolerance of (30° were used. This yielded 1910 nonredundant upperlimit constraints as output from CYANA, with 156 upperlimit constraints being violated with more than 0.5 Å and 110 dihedral-angle constraints being violated with more than 5°. In all of the structures calculated in this first stage, the overall fold was the same. The secondary structure elements were very similar to those found in the crystal structure of holoTN3, whereas the loop regions were poorly defined. The violated constraints were refined through iterative rounds of structure calculations with the CYANA protocol ANNEAL. When all violated constraints were increased to 5.5 Å, approximately 90% of the violations were eliminated and subsequently the remaining violations were evaluated by inspection. Violated angle constraints were used with increased tolerance ((10°) or removed if they continued to be violated. The overall fold was not affected by the refinement of the constraint dataset, but the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was slightly increased for the secondary structure elements and more significantly increased in the loop regions. The lowest energy structure and the NOE and dihedralangle constraint datasets obtained from CYANA were used for the calculation of 200 structures with XPLOR-NIH version 2.9.1 (30), using a simulated annealing protocol. The 20 lowest energy structures were refined with CNS version 1.1 (31), using a simulated annealing protocol with an explicit layer of water (32). The use of first XPLOR-NIH and then CNS did not affect the overall structure, but in each case, it did improve the Ramachandran plot distribution and decrease the RMSD relative to the crystal structure of holoTN3. The final structures have no NOE violations above 0.4 Å and no angle violations above 5°. An overview of the results

N-terminal part of the recombinant construct. A backbone assignment of holoTN3 confirmed this observation, indicating that the disorder of the N terminal is not related to the presence or absence of calcium. This part of the construct is not represented in the final structure. In the structure of full-length TN, the helix involved in the trimerisation (E2) proceeds to residue 52 followed by a short strand (B0 ) residues 53-56), a turn, and another strand (B1 ) residues 59-65) (13). The N-terminal residues that could not be assigned in apo- or holoTN3 are in the crystal structure of holoTN3 involved in the formation of two of the three strands in a sheet (B0 ) 45-52, B1 ) 58-65, and B5 ) 174-179), which packs against the same sheet from a crystallographically related monomer (21). Thus, the residues that could not be assigned by NMR adopt different conformations in the crystal structures of full-length TN and holoTN3. This may suggest that the N-terminal -sheet structure in the X-ray structure of holoTN3 is a result of the crystal-lattice packing, while it is not a major conformation in solution. Because the overall structure of apoTN3 still closely matches the crystal structure of holoTN3, the residues 45-64 are not critical for the folding of the domain. This is further supported by the fact that mutations of Cys50 and Cys60 to prevent formation of the N-terminal disulfide bridge did not affect the overall stability of the CTLD (unpublished results). EVidence for Two Conformations of Pro144 in ApoTN3. In all structures of CTLDs with calcium bound, including the crystal structures of holoTN and holoTN3, the peptide bond preceding a conserved proline (Pro144 in TN) adopts the cis conformation. In the backbone spectra of apoTN3, two NMR signals were observed for each of the four residues preceding Pro144 (Figure 2). This is interpreted as evidence that Pro144 can adopt both the cis and trans conformation. For each of the residues 140-143, the ratio between the intensities of the two peaks indicates approximately 90% of the major conformation. Only this major conformation can be observed in the less sensitive side-chain spectra. For Pro87, Pro173, and the major conformation of Pro144, strong dR or d  NOE connectivities between the prolines and the subsequent residues are evidence of the trans conformation (26). We therefore conclude that the peptide bond preceding Pro144 in apoTN3 is in the trans conformation in 90% of the molecules.

In apo- and holoTN3, the core structure is conserved, whereas large conformational changes occur in the loops. The structures of apoTN3, apoMBP, and MMR-CRD4 illustrate different levels of disorder in the loop regions in the partial or complete absence of calcium. In the structure of MMR-CRD4, a calcium ion is found in the canonical calcium-binding site 2 only, although the molecule is known to bind two calcium ions.

for the 20 best structures is given in Table 1, and the structure is shown in Figure 5. The number of NOEs assigned to each residue is shown in Figure 3. It illustrates that the number of long-range constraints as well as the total number of constraints are lowest in the loop regions. This is also reflected in the higher RMSD values for the residues in these regions (Figure 3).

Structural Comparison with HoloTN3. A structural alignment of the NMR structure of apoTN3 and the crystal structure of holoTN3 confirms that the core secondary structure of TN3 is essentially the same in the apo and holo forms. For the residues defining the core structure, the backbone atoms of the lowest energy NMR structure of apoTN3 (NMR) and the crystal structure of holoTN3 (Xray) align with a RMSD of 0.60 Å (Figure 6). In contrast to the core region, major structural differences occur in the loop regions. The most striking difference is that the residues corresponding to L3 and L4 in holoTN3 form one loop in apoTN3. However, because of the lack of long-range NOE constraints in this region (Figure 3b), the conformations of the loops are not well-determined (Figure 5). The calcium-ligating residues are Asp116, Glu120,

Structure of the Calcium-Free Form of TN3 Glu143, Asp145, Gly147, Glu150, Asn151, and Aspl65 (21), and the residues critical for K4 binding are Lys148, Glu150, and Asp165 (15). Except for Asp165, all of these residues are located in the loops, and as a consequence, their positions are poorly defined. Backbone Dynamics of Apo- and HoloTN3. To further characterize different properties of apo- and holoTN3, backbone dynamics were analyzed by measuring longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation rates and {1H}-15Nheteronuclear NOEs. The results are summarized in Figure 3. The results indicate similar relaxation rates for apo- and holoTN3 for the major part of the residues. However, a tendency for longer T1 values and shorter T2 values can be observed for apoTN3, indicating a longer correlation time. Using the Liparo-Szabo model-free formalism, the overall tumbling time could be estimated to 9.5 ns for apoTN3 and 8.2 ns for holoTN3. This correlates well with the fact that apoTN3 is less compact because of the extended-loop region. For the fragment consisting of residues 139-149, which corresponds to L3-L4 in holoTN3, significantly lower NOE values, higher T2 values, and lower T1 values are observed for apoTN3, whereas holoTN3 has values comparable to the rest of the protein in this region. L3 and L4 harbor three of the six calcium-coordinating residues, and the results indicate that in the absence of calcium the backbone atoms in this region exhibit increased flexibility on a pico- to nanosecond time scale. This may be of significant importance for the biological function of TN, because two of the three residues, which are critical for plasminogen binding (Lys148 and Glu150), are located in loop 4. In the segments corresponding to L1-L2 and B3-B4, T2 values appear to be very short in apoTN3. The remaining three residues involved in calcium coordination (Asn115 and Glu120 in L1 and Asp165 at the end of B4) are located in these segments, and the observations suggest exchange processes on a slower time scale than the one found in the L3-L4 region. Thus, in apoTN3, two of the calcium-binding loops (L3 and L4) exhibit flexibility on a fast time scale, whereas L1 and the end of B4, which also are involved in calcium binding may be involved in intermediate-exchange processes. Together, the large RMSD values and the backbone dynamics both indicate that, in the NMR structure of apoTN3, neither the calcium-binding site nor the K4-binding site is welldefined. DISCUSSION CTLD Loop Regions. The conserved core structure and the dramatic structural changes in the loops of apoTN3 are in agreement with the crystal structures of the CTLDs of mannose-binding protein (MBP) with and without calcium bound (33). In the crystal structure of apoMBP, four conformations of the loop region are found in the asymmetric unit, most likely representing different conformations in solution. This agrees well with the large conformational space spanned by L3-L4 in the 20 best NMR structures of apoTN3. However, in all four copies of apoMBP, the residues corresponding to L3-L4 still form two distinct loops, in contrast to the one extended loop (L34) in apoTN3 (Figure 6).

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 27, 2004 8641 The residues corresponding to L3-L4 in apoTN3 forming one big loop are similar to the structure of CRD4 in the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR-CRD4), in which calcium was only bound to the canonical calcium site 2. The residues corresponding to L1-L4 form a large loop (Figure 6), which by domain swapping packs against the secondary structure core of a symmetry-related molecule (34). MMRCRD4 is capable of binding two calcium ions (35). Although no structure of MMR-CRD4 with two calcium ions and a compact-loop region has been reported, it is believed to exist for MMR-CRD4 to bind its carbohydrate ligands. The crystal structure with the extended-loop conformation is thought to represent a partly unfolded endosomal form. MBP, TN3, and MMR-CRD4, which are all able to bind two calcium ions in the loop region, thus exhibit three levels of structural disorder in the absence of one or two of the calcium ions. In all three cases, the structures indicate that the loops in the absence of calcium are flexible. However, in MBP, four distinct loops can still be observed in the apo form; in apoTN3, residues corresponding to L3-L4 form one loop; and in MMR-CRD4, residues corresponding to L1-L4 form a single extended loop, when the calcium ion in site 1 is lost (Figure 6). The structure of apoTN3 is thus further evidence that CTLDs consist of conserved core structures with loop regions that are able to adopt a variety of conformations. Cis-Trans Isomerization of Pro144. Pro144 in TN3, which is conserved in many CTLDs, adopts the cis conformation in all known structures of CTLDs with calcium bound. In the solution structure of apoTN3, this proline adopts the trans conformation and there is evidence for a minor fraction of approximately 10% of the molecules displaying a different conformation, interpreted as the cis conformation. This is in agreement with results for apoMBP, where both the cis and trans conformation of the corresponding proline are found in the same crystal (33), and fluorescence experiments indicate that in apoMBP approximately 80% of these prolines adopt the trans conformation (36). In apoTC14, missing signals for the two residues following Pro87 are suggested to result from conformational flexibility in this region (37). Although there is no proof for cis-trans isomerization of Pro87 in apoTC14, this increased flexibility could corroborate the assumption that Pro87 is able to adopt more than one conformation Dynamics of CTLD Ligand-Binding Loops. The increased flexibility in the calcium-binding loops of apoTN3 is evidence for the stabilization of the structure upon calcium binding as is often observed upon ligand binding. The result is, however, in contrast to results reported for the C-type lectin TC14, where the dynamics of the ligand-binding loops are the same as those for the rest of the protein both with and without calcium bound (37). TC14 binds D-galactose, and it is suggested that the conformational stability of the ligand-binding region may be a prerequisite for the precise positioning of the ligand-binding residues to bind a small ligand with high specificity. For apoTN3, the flexibility may reflect that the conformation of a protein ligand is less strictly defined than the conformation of a carbohydrate ligand. In addition to the conserved proline bridging loop 3 and loop 4 (Pro87 in TC14 and Pro144 in TN3), TC14 contains three additional proline residues in loop 2 and 3, which may contribute to the rigidity of the loops. These residues are

Nielbo et al. Extracellular Calcium Switch. The ability of calcium to inhibit the interaction between TN and plasminogen may provide a means of regulation. The dissociation constants for the interaction between TN3 and the two calcium ions are 37 and 61 µM (unpublished results), whereas Kd for the interaction between TN3 and K4 is 50 µM (15). The concentration of free Ca2+ in the blood is normally tightly controlled at a concentration of 1 mM, which is enough to keep TN in the calcium-saturated state. However, the role of calcium ions as extracellular messengers is becoming wellestablished, and increasing numbers of mechanisms regulated by local changes of the extracellular calcium levels have been reported (39). An interaction between TN and plasminogen mediated by a local decrease in the calcium concentration therefore seems plausible, and it can be speculated that one or more other calcium-binding proteins must be involved in the regulation of the calcium-saturation state of TN and thereby play a role in the biological mechanism of the interaction between TN and plasminogen.

FIGURE 7: Interacting residues in K4 and TN3. (Left) K4 (1PK4). (Center) holoTN3 (1TN3). (Right) The lowest energy NMR structure of apoTN3 (1RJH). The critical charged residues are shown as ball and stick models, and the calcium ions (1 and 2) in holoTN3 are shown as yellow spheres. On apoTN, the most dynamic part of the backbone is colored in red. With respect to the K4-binding residues in TN3, two major differences between apo- and holoTN3 should be noted: In holoTN3, the two negatively charged residues are close in space, because they are coordinating the same calcium ion, and their charges are counteracted by the calcium ion. In apoTN3, residues K148 and E150 are exposed and located in a flexible region of the protein. Thus, in apoTN3, the binding site seems able to adopt a conformation suitable for K4 binding, whereas this is clearly not the case in holoTN3.

not found in TN3 and may be one reason for the conformational stability of the loops in apoTC14. The reduced dispersion and slightly increased line width in the 15N-HSQC of apoTN3 relative to holoTN3 also indicates that the structure of apoTN3 is less well-defined because of the absence of calcium. Also this is in contrast to the results found for TC14, where the holo form yields broader lines than the apo form. For TC14, two factors may reverse the observed pattern relative to TN3. One factor is that because the loops also in TC14 are less dynamic they cannot contribute to line broadening of the apo form relative to the holo form as is the case for apoTN3. In addition, the major dimeric form of holoTC14 is in equilibrium with approximately 5% of higher order aggregates (38), and it has been suggested that this aggregation is mediated by the presence of calcium (37). This would contribute to a higher average molecular weight, slower tumbling, and hence broader line width of holoTC14 relative to apoTC14. Both apo- and holoTN3 are monomers in solution and are therefore not subject to the same line-broadening effects from dimerization or multimerization. Interaction between Plg K4 and TN3. The binding of lysine analogues to K4 depends on the positively charged residue Arg71 and on the negatively charged residues Asp55 and Asp57. In addition, Arg32 is also important for the binding to TN3. Similarly, in apoTN3, the positively charged residue Lys148 and the two negatively charged residues Glu150 and Asp165 are important for binding to K4. In holoTN3, Glu150 and Asp165 are involved in calcium-ion binding. Clearly, the removal of the calcium ions from TN3 exposes the two negatively charged residues and makes these available for polar interactions with either or both of the positively charged residues Arg32 and Arg71 on K4. The release of the calcium ions from TN3 also increases the pico- to nanosecond backbone dynamics at Glu150 and Lys148, whereas the backbone dynamics at Asp165 indicate an exchange process on a slower time scale. This suggests that together the three residues, Lys148, Glu150, and Asp165, may be able to adopt a conformation that may permit optimal polar interactions with the counterions on Plg K4 (Figure 7).
