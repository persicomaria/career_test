Summary The LasI/LasR quorum-sensing system plays a pivotal role in virulence gene regulation of the opportunistic human pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here we report the crystal structure of the acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) synthase LasI that produces 3-oxo-C12-AHL from the substrates 3-oxo-C12acyl-carrier protein (acyl-ACP) and S-adenosyl-Lmethionine. The LasI six-stranded beta sheet platform, buttressed by three alpha helices, forms a Vshaped substrate-binding cleft that leads to a tunnel passing through the enzyme that can accommodate the acyl-chain of acyl-ACP. This tunnel places no apparent restriction on acyl-chain length, in contrast to a restrictive hydrophobic pocket seen in the AHLsynthase EsaI. Interactions of essential conserved Nterminal residues, Arg23, Phe27 and Trp33, suggest that the N-terminus forms an enclosed substratebinding pocket for S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Analysis of AHL-synthase surface residues identified a binding site for acyl-ACP, a role that was supported by in vivo reporter assay analysis of the mutated residues, including Arg154 and Lys150. This structure and the novel explanation of AHL-synthase acyl-chain-length selectivity promise to guide the design of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-specific quorum-sensing inhibitors as antibacterial agents. Introduction Bacteria communicate using chemical signals to sense cell density and activate differentiation to diverse lifestyles by a process known as quorum sensing (QS). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, QS allows for the ordered expression, activation and repression, of several hundred genes, constituting ª 6% of the genome (Schuster et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2003). The downstream consequences of this intercellular signalling are complex cellular behavioural processes and virulence (De Kievit and Iglewski, 2000). In response to QS, P. aeruginosa forms a biofilm composed of sessile bacterial colonies encased in a exopolysaccharide matrix that is resistant to antimicrobials and the host immune system (Rychlik et al., 2000). Such biofilms are associated with a wide variety of persistent and chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients and immune-compromised individuals (reviewed recently in Parsek and Greenberg, 2000; Miller and Bassler, 2001; Whitehead et al., 2001; Withers et al., 2001; Fuqua and Greenberg, 2002). Furthermore, the maturation and antibiotic resistance of the biofilm requires an active QS system (Shih and Huang, 2002). In P. aeruginosa, QS is mediated by cell-permeable acyl-homoserine lactone signals (AHLs; Fig. 1) (Pearson et al., 1994; Swift et al., 1999). Intracellular accumulation of a sufficient concentration of two specific AHLs, C4homoserine lactone (HSL) and 3-oxo-C12-HSL, activates two distinct transcriptional regulators, RhlR or LasR, respectively. Triggered by the binding of each specific signal, these response regulators lead to generally increased transcription of many genes within the bacterial genome (De Kievit et al., 2002; Schuster et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2003). Thus, complexes of AHL with the response regulators LasR and RhlR are involved in the changes in gene expression patterns that lead to virulence factor production and ultimately biofilm formation under certain conditions (Davies et al., 1998; De Kievit et al., 2001). The LasI/LasR system regulates the expression and activity of both the Rhl and Las systems, which places it at the top of the hierarchy of the AHL-mediated QS systems of P. aeruginosa (Seed et al., 1995). Pseudomonas aeruginosa AHLs are produced by the AHL-synthases LasI and RhlI from the substrates S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and acyl-acyl-carrier protein (acyl-ACP) (Moré et al., 1996; Val and Cronan, 1998; Parsek et al., 1999; Hoang et al., 2002). LasI produces predominantly 3-oxo-C12-HSL and RhlI produces C4HSL because of intrinsic enzymatic specificity for particular acyl-ACPs and the available cellular acyl-ACP pool

(Kuo et al., 1994; Fray et al., 1999; Fuqua and Eberhard, 1999; De Kievit and Iglewski, 2000; Hoang et al., 2002). Natural and synthetic mechanisms that inhibit or misregulate QS have detrimental effects on bacterial pathogenicity. P. aeruginosa null mutants that lack the AHLsynthases, LasI and RhlI, or the response regulator LasR, show a decrease in biofilm formation and attenuated virulence in several in vivo infection model systems (Tang et al., 1996; Rumbaugh et al., 1999; Shih and Huang, 2002). Strategies that either inhibit QS or cause the premature expression of QS-regulated genes can provide broad-spectrum control of particular bacterial diseases (Beck von Bodman et al., 1998; Leadbetter and Greenberg, 2000; Dong et al., 2001; Smith and Iglewski, 2003). A number of compounds that inhibit response regulator detection of AHLs are being studied as potential future therapies for treatment of human infections by virulent Gram-negative bacteria (Manefield et al., 2002; Reverchon et al., 2002; Hentzer et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2003). An alternative strategy is to develop approaches to inhibit AHL signal synthesis by targeting specific AHL-synthases. Such an approach requires a much better understanding of AHL synthesis through mechanistic and structural studies. LasI is one of the most divergent AHL-synthases, and is of great interest because of the important role it plays in human disease. LasI synthesizes an AHL with a longer acyl-chain (C12) than those produced by many other AHLsynthases (C4­C8) (Fig. 1). Its protein sequence is divergent from the most commonly studied AHL-synthases, LuxI, RhlI and EsaI, with only 28% identity to EsaI. Structural studies of the AHL-synthase EsaI from the agricultural pathogen Pantoea stewartii have revealed the overall structure of an AHL-synthase and the presence of a small hydrophobic pocket for acyl-chain binding (Watson et al., 2002). However, the mechanism of acyl-chain-length selectivity is still not apparent. Here, we present the structure of the P. aeruginosa AHL-synthase, LasI, determined by X-ray crystallography. This structure has major differences in the location and secondary structural assignment of residues in the N-terminus, which provide insight into structural changes that occur upon substrate binding. In addition, structural analysis of the two AHL-synthases uncovers the nature of acyl-ACP and SAM binding, as well as the structural basis of acyl-chain-length discrimination. This work will provide essential information to structurebased approaches to produce QS inhibitors specific for P. aeruginosa.

Results LasI structure In order to understand how LasI manifests its specificity for longer acyl-chains and to provide a better mechanistic understanding of AHL synthesis in general, we determined its structure using X-ray crystallography. A novel beta-turn crystal engineering approach was used to promote crystallization of a LasI mutant, because the native enzyme was refractory to crystallization (described in Gould et al., 2004). The tight turn between putative beta strands 2 and 3 was mutated to create a type I beta turn. This LasI beta turn mutant is referred to as LasIDG. Specifically, the sequence `DTPEAQ' was replaced with `DGQ', which resulted in a more stable protein that crystallized readily, and retained ª 90% of the activity of the native protein. The LasIDG structure was solved using the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) phasing method with a single mercury soaked crystal, and was refined with native data to a resolution of 2.3 Å (Table 1). The LasI structural model is complete from the N-terminal residue Met1 to residue Arg197, and the re-engineered beta turn is numbered Asp59, Gly60G, Gln64 (Fig. 2A). LasI forms a trimer around a crystallographic threefold axis, but is a monomer in solution (data not shown). In addition to sulphate and zinc ion binding, strand transfer within the crystal also appears to be a crystallographic feature of the LasI structure. The C-terminal five residues of one molecule form a beta strand by hydrogen bonding to the residues of beta strand b1 in an adjacent molecule that is not part of the crystallographic trimer. Two of the four sulphate ions bound to the surface of the protein lie in crystallographic special positions (on the threefold axis) and make contacts with Arg154, Lys150 and Arg172. The overall structure of LasI is a three-layer (aba) sandwich containing eight a-helices (three 310-helices) surrounding a highly twisted platform of nine b-strands (Fig. 2B). This platform is primarily composed of an antiparallel b-sheet with a prominent active site V-shaped cleft (V cleft) between the parallel b-strands, b4 and b5, consistent with members of the Acyl-CoA-N-acyltransferase fold family. A b-bulge between residues 103 and 105 in b4 was also observed in the EsaI structure (Watson et al., 2002), and this particular b-bulge appears to be a unique and conserved feature of the AHL-synthases. The GCN5related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) are also members

of the Acyl-CoA-N-acyltransferase fold family, but they have a different b-bulge offset by one residue (reviewed in Marmorstein and Roth, 2001). This, in combination with the interaction of the 3-oxo group of acyl-ACP with Thr140 would help guide the acyl-chain of acyl-ACP into the active site. In the AHL-synthases, this b-bulge coordinates two water molecules in highly conserved positions, in addition to those observed at positions in common with the GNAT enzymes (see below). Upon substrate binding, these water molecules may be replaced by the oxo substitution at the C1 position of acyl-ACP or they may participate in catalysis. There is a large electrostatic cluster in the core of the N-terminal half of LasI adjacent to the V cleft (Fig. 2B and C), which contains a complex network of ion pairs formed by the side chains from several highly conserved residues in the AHL-synthase family. Mutagenesis analysis of LuxI, RhlI and EsaI enzymes show that most of the residues involved in this cluster, Arg23, Asp42, Asp44, Asp47, Arg70, Glu101, Ser103 and Arg104, are essential for AHL synthesis (Hanzelka et al., 1997; Parsek et al., 1997; Watson et al., 2002). This cluster appears to contribute to the stability of interactions between N-terminal helices and the front surface of the b-sheet, but may also perform a catalytic function. Adjacent to this cluster is a group of well-ordered water molecules that bridge the conserved Glu101 and several

backbone amides and carbonyls (Fig. 2D) in the V cleft. Two of these are unique to AHL-synthases (noted above). Two other water molecules are in identical positions to those observed in EsaI and many, but not all, of the GNAT enzyme structures. A current proposed mechanism of Nacylation by GNATs involves proton abstraction from the substrate amine to be acylated by an activated water molecule (Hickman et al., 1999; Tanner et al., 1999). The water molecule bound to Glu101 in LasI is a commonly conserved water molecule in the AHL-synthases, and is the same position to play this role in the catalytic mechanism of the AHL-synthases. A second N-acylation mechanism used by the histone acetyltransferase Esa1 (not be confused with the AHL-synthase EsaI) proceeds via a thioacyl covalent intermediate; in this enzyme, water molecules are also located near the conserved water molecule noted above (Yan et al., 2002). In the N-terminus, several highly conserved AHL-synthase residues were missing in the previously published EsaI structure, but are seen clearly in the LasI structure. Residues 15­28 could not be built in the EsaI structure because of disorder in the crystal, and the remaining Nterminal residues were visible but slightly disordered with higher than average B factors (Watson et al., 2002). In LasI, the helix a2 begins at Lys12 and ends at Phe27, whereas in EsaI helix a2 consists of the residues from Phe28 to Gln40 (Figs 2A and 3A). In this arrangement,

the conserved Phe27/28 is located at different ends of the helix a2. In LasI, Phe27 does not appear to be involved in maintenance of the structure and is in close proximity to the active site cleft. In contrast, Phe28 in EsaI is distant from the active site and would require a large conformational change to bring it into proximity with the active site cleft. This is also true for LasI Trp33 and EsaI Trp 34; in LasI, Trp33 is located in the loop following a2 and is proximal to the V cleft, whereas in EsaI it is located in a2, ª 30 Å away. Despite the large conformational difference between LasI and EsaI in the N-terminus (Fig. 3A), a similar electrostatic cluster (as previously described) is maintained in both enzymes. Another differing region is the top of the V cleft where LasI has a short loop connect© 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 53, 1135­1146

ing b4 and a6, and EsaI has an a-helical segment (Fig. 3B and C). This region may be involved in ACP binding and will be discussed later. Acyl-chain binding site AHLs vary greatly in acyl-chain length, from the C4-AHL produced by P. aeruginosa RhlI (Parsek et al., 1997), up to C18-AHLs produced by Sinorhizobium meliloti SinI (Marketon et al., 2002). LasI produces 3-oxo-C12-HSL, one of the longer AHLs made by AHL-synthases. Sequence analysis of the AHL-synthase family fails to reveal a robust correlation between sequence composition and acyl-chain length. Therefore, to accommodate

1140 T. A. Gould, H. P. Schweizer and M. E. A. Churchill and create a preference for acyl-ACPs of different acylchain lengths, a number of sequence and tertiary structure differences must have evolved in different AHL-synthases. The structure of the acyl-chain binding pocket in LasI is a tunnel and provides a clear explanation for substrate specificity (Fig. 3B­D). We modelled 3-oxo-C12-acylphosphopantetheine into LasI based on a model produced and validated previously for EsaI (Watson et al., 2002). The 3-oxo-dodecanoyl portion of the modelled substrate fits easily into the hydrophobic tunnel of LasI in an elongated conformation (Fig. 3D). Surface rendering of LasI reveals that the tunnel in the acyl-chain binding region permits the end of the acyl-chain to protrude (Fig. 3B and D). This tunnel is formed by the following residues: Trp33, Trp69, Met79, Leu102, Phe105, Thr121, Leu122, Met125, Leu140, Thr142, Thr144, Val148, Met151, Met152, Ala155, Leu157, Ile178 and Leu188. Several of these residues, including Met79, Phe105, Thr142 and Thr144, are well conserved among AHL-synthases, and appear to position the acyl-chain in the proper orientation for catalysis. Close examination of the binding pocket reveals several subtle differences between the EsaI and LasI structures that appear to contribute to the size of the pocket (Fig. 3B and C). The different sizes of hydrophobic side chains in the acyl-chain binding pocket and slight changes in the orientations of a6 and a8 contribute to the structure of the closed pocket in EsaI versus the tunnel observed in LasI. The residues in EsaI that occlude the pocket are larger than those in the same position in LasI, thus limiting the acyl-chain size to a C6 acyl-chain. In particular, EsaI has, relative to LasI, W155 in place of Leu157, Phe123 in place of M125, and a different position of the side chain of L176 compared to Ile175 (Fig. 2A). Acyl-ACP binding site The nature of the acyl-chain tunnel in LasI places no steric restriction on the acyl-chain length of acyl-ACPs that could bind to LasI. How LasI selects longer acyl-ACPs relative to shorter ones that are known to be prevalent in P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli is not known. There must be a mechanism that relies on a delicate balance of binding energy contributions of the acyl-chain relative to the ACP portion of acyl-ACP to accomplish the exquisite selectivity observed in vivo. In order to determine the precise nature of this mechanism, knowledge of how acylACP binds to LasI is needed, but to date no cocrystal structure with acyl-ACP and any AHL-synthase has been determined. Until an AHL-synthase­acyl-ACP complex structure can be determined, we used modelling, mutagenesis and AHL reporter assays to identify a catalytically important patch of surface residues near the active site that we propose forms a binding site for the ACP portion of acyl-ACP. Previous analysis of ACP binding sites on the surface of both cyclopropane synthases and acyl-ACP synthases (Parris et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2002) suggested that protein­ACP interactions are largely electrostatic and involve the negatively charged a-helix 3 of ACP. We identified a specific pattern of basic side chains surrounding a hydrophobic patch on the surface of LasI that may be involved in direct ACP binding. This region is located on the C-terminal side of the V cleft, encompassing parts of b5, b8 and much of a7 (Fig. 2A and B). In the crystal, these highly conserved basic residues located on or near a7 form extensive crystal contacts; they coordinate sulphate ions through a highly symmetrical network of wellordered water molecules. These interactions appear to hinder cocrystallization of LasI­substrate complexes and prevent substrate binding by blocking access to the substrate binding site. Based on the structure and residue contacts observed for holo-ACP (ACP with the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group attached to Ser36) binding to acyl-carrier protein synthase (AcpS; PDB entry 1F80), we predicted that the protein portion of ACP interacts with LasI helix a7. No other surface helix with such basic character exists in LasI, and interestingly, we found that many of the side chains were identical to those found in the AcpS binding site. The basic residues, Lys150, Arg154, Arg161, His165, Lys167 and Arg172, form a highly positively charged patch on the LasI surface (Fig. 4A). In support of the importance of this region, many of the same residues are absolutely or spatially conserved in the EsaI structure, including Lys148, Arg152, Arg170 (similar to His165 of LasI) and Arg144 (same spatial position as Arg172) (Fig. 4A). To test whether this surface exposed region of the enzyme was involved in LasI AHL production, several of these surface residues were mutated and the resulting AHLs produced by the mutants in E. coli were examined for potency in a cell-based LasR-dependent reporter activity assay (Pearson et al., 1994; Schaefer et al., 2000). Single point mutants, K150A, K150Q, R154A, R154Q, R154E, R172A, as well as double mutants 150/ 154QQ and 150/154EE, were produced and expressed in E. coli. Soluble purified protein levels were monitored by enzyme purification and Western blotting (data not shown) and studies with K150A and R154A were discontinued because equivalent levels of soluble enzyme could not be purified from the bacterial cells. These are surfaceexposed hydrophilic residues, which, when mutated to a non-polar residue such as alanine, appear to destabilize the protein. However, when these residues were mutated to hydrophilic residues of neutral or opposite charge, the protein is stable and gives rise to soluble protein levels equivalent to LasIDG after purification.

under the control of LasR (Pearson et al., 1994; Schaefer et al., 2000). The LasR bioassay is differentially sensitive to AHLs of different chain lengths and three-position substitution, with a bias toward the natural ligand, 3-oxo-C12AHL. Therefore, different levels of response could result from different amounts or types of AHLs. Figure 4B shows that the double mutants 150/154QQ and 150/154EE, and R154E, but not R172A, are deficient in AHL production relative to the LasIDG enzyme under the conditions examined here.

Discussion Conserved features of AHL-synthases AHL-synthase structure. The crystal structure of LasI provides the opportunity to examine the common features of the AHL-synthase structure and mechanism. LasI has 28% and 42% sequence identity and similarity, respectively, in comparison with the EsaI enzyme (Fig. 2A). These enzymes produce different length AHLs and represent divergent groups of AHL-synthases. The overall root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the overlaid LasI and EsaI structures is 2.3 Å, but for the most conserved 74 residues it is 0.7 Å (with a 2 Å cutoff in the LSQMAN alignment and r.m.s.d. calculation the value). These 74 residues comprise the core domain for phosphopantetheine binding proteins such as AHL-synthases as well as N-acetyltransferases (Watson et al., 2002). This core consists of the strands b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6 and b8, and a helices a3 and a4. Helices a6 and a7 are also conserved, but in slightly different positions in the structures, which precludes their inclusion in the core fold by the set distance cutoff. Notably, portions of the relatively unstructured loop between strands b3 and b4 (74­84), which includes a4 and a5 and specifically residues Met79, Thr83, Phe84 and Tyr46, are also conserved. This region is adjacent to the loop between a2 and a3 that also contains the conserved residues Trp33 and Phe27. These residues do not appear to be involved in tertiary structure interactions, and their position directly in front of the active-site V cleft may be conserved for the purpose of binding SAM, perhaps by helping position the SAM amine nitrogen for N-acylation of the C1 position of acyl-ACP. The aromatic side chains would allow a stacked ring sandwich type of binding with adenine of SAM, as is commonly observed in SAM binding enzymes (Schubert et al., 2003). N-terminal conformational change. The N-terminus of LasI forms an enclosed active site suitable for SAM binding, with the conserved residues appropriately placed to stack with SAM. In fact, the N-terminal conformation of LasI is quite similar to N-terminal regions of the GCN5-

In contrast, the N-terminal region that is visible in the EsaI structure is in a more open conformation compared to LasI, which appears to be in a closed, potentially catalytically competent conformation. Certainly the conserved residues of EsaI must be brought into proximity of the active site for catalysis to occur, and therefore a conformational change must take place. The observed differences in secondary structure and location within the fold of these highly conserved residues in the N-terminus of LasI and EsaI is perhaps related to the different crystallization conditions that capture the enzymes with the N-terminus in different states. This is consistent with the biological explanation that the N-terminal regions of the AHL-synthases are flexible, and that conformational change or stabilization of a particular structure of the protein may take place upon substrate binding. Binding of substrate may move a2 closer to the active site, or a2 may unfold and reform to give a structure similar to that observed in LasI. The difference in the N-terminal regions in relation to the active site between LasI and EsaI suggests that the AHL-synthases potentially undergo a dramatic conformational change that brings conserved residues of the putative SAM binding site in close proximity to the catalytic site. The N-termini of the GNAT enzymes can also be found in a variety of conformations. For example, in arylalkyl-amine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), this region, a1­ a2, undergoes substantial conformational changes after acetyl-CoA binds (Hickman et al., 1999). The homologous loop of AANAT has been shown to act as a regulatory region in the 14-3-3 proteins, which structurally modulates the substrate binding sites, measurably increasing the affinity of AANAT for its substrates in a bi-bi sequentially ordered mechanism (Obsil et al., 2001). Furthermore, EsaI binds ACP in the absence of SAM (data not shown), which supports a mechanism, similar to GNATs, where by analogy to the binding of acetyl-CoA, the AHL-synthase binds acyl-ACP first, followed by a conformational rearrangement of the N-terminal domain before SAM binding. This order of binding differs from a previously proposed reaction mechanism, but is not inconsistent with the kinetics results used to derive the model (Parsek et al., 1999). Acyl-ACP binding in acyl-chain-length specificity The role of the acyl-chain. The closed conformation of the apo-LasI structure has a cleft and tunnel that can easily accommodate the acyl-phosphopantetheine chain of acyl-ACP as well as a nearby cavity for SAM. The observation of the acyl-chain tunnel in LasI places no theoretical restriction on the length of the acyl-chain that could be bound by LasI. One reason that AHLs with a longer acyl-chain than 3-oxo-C12 are rarely observed most probably results from the lack of availability of longchain acyl-ACPs in P. aeruginosa, because those are required in significant amounts for lipopolysaccharide and membrane phospholipid synthesis (Hoang et al., 2002). The exact distribution of acyl-chain lengths in pools of P. aeruginosa acyl-ACP is not known, but studies that shift the pool of acyl-ACPs toward shorter acyl-chain lengths in P. aeruginosa by manipulating keto-acyl-ACP reductase (FabG) activity result in a concomitant shift in production of AHLs with shorter acyl-chains (Hoang et al., 2002). The LasI structure suggests that if longer-chain acyl-ACPs were available in the bacterial cell, then the corresponding AHLs could be synthesized. Based on the hydrophobic close fitting structure of the LasI tunnel for the C12 acylchain, the affinity would be expected to increase as a function of chain length up to 12, because of van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. However, acylchains longer than 12 will protrude from the tunnel, and gain less additional binding energy than those encased by the protein. In contrast to the more restrictive hydrophobic pocket in EsaI (Watson et al., 2002), the presence of a hydrophobic tunnel in LasI may facilitate the design and/or discovery of specific LasI inhibitors. Finally, depending on the precise position of ACP binding across helices a6 and a7, it is possible that acyl-ACP binding itself may close the tunnel and restrict the length of acylchain that can be positioned in the enzyme. The role of acyl carrier protein. A putative binding site for ACP on the surface of LasI includes a basic patch of residues on a7 at the top of the V cleft. LasI is sensitive to changes made to basic residues Lys150 and Arg154 in the centre of a7, but not to a nearby basic residue, Arg172, which is in b8 at the very edge of the proposed ACP binding site (Fig. 4B). These data support the role of basic surface residues in a7 in LasI activity. Furthermore, their position on the surface and dramatic similarity to the ACP binding site of AcpS suggest that their most likely role is in acyl-ACP binding. Additionally, all mutations of Arg154 to hydrophilic residues, whether singly or in combination with Lys150 mutations, have a significant impact on AHL production without significantly affecting protein solubility, which suggests a more important role for Arg154 in the interaction than the other residues we have examined. In sequence analysis of all known AHL-synthases, we found that Arg154 is always either a lysine or arginine (Fig. 2A). The functional consequences of altering the centre of a7 also suggests that the interaction with LasI may be similar to that observed in the ACP­AcpS complex (Parris et al., 2000). In the holo-ACP­AcpS complex, holo-ACP binds to a serine and backbone amides in a loop of AcpS in addition to helix a3. LasI has additional contacts in a loop between b4 and a6 that are similar to

LasI structure 1143 AcpS, and which may also be involved in ACP binding. The AHL-synthase family appears to have little sequence or structural conservation in this particular region of the protein, as the same loop in EsaI adopts an alpha helical (a5) conformation and has additional basic residues on the surface, whereas LasI is relatively neutral in this region. This proposed difference in ACP binding sites among AHL-synthases may be functionally relevant in selection of longer rather than shorter acyl-ACPs. Longer acylchains will have intrinsically higher binding affinity for the hydrophobic tunnel in the enzyme than shorter acylchains. This predicts that the ACP part of acyl-ACP will make a smaller relative binding energy contribution when binding to long-chain AHL-synthases than to shorterchain AHL-synthases. To compensate for this, the shorterchain AHL-synthases may have more substantial protein­ protein interactions with ACP, including greater structural stability and positive charge in the ACP binding region. We suggest that there must be a delicate balance between the binding contributions of the acyl-chain relative to ACP components of acyl-ACP for each type of AHLsynthase. This balance of binding energies would push the binding equilibrium of a long-chain AHL-synthase such as LasI toward binding acyl-ACPs with longer acylchains, permitting longer acyl-chains to be preferentially selected, despite the predominance of shorter acyl-ACPs in the cellular pool. Experimental procedures Protein purification and crystallization
An active re-engineered LasI mutant, LasIDG, was overexpressed in E. coli from a pViet-based vector (Hoang et al., 1999), pViet-LasIDG, as described previously (Gould et al., 2004). Briefly, the His-tagged protein was purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate using Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) affinity chromatography. The His-tag is removed by thrombin cleavage followed by Superdex 75 size exclusion chromatography. The protein was ª 95% pure by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS­PAGE analysis and mass spectrometry (data not shown), and was crystallized using vapour diffusion methods from 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.125 M Na2SO4, 0.1 M MOPS (pH 6.5). The crystals were cryo-protected [in 2.0 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 M Na2SO4, 0.1 M MOPS (pH 6.5) and 15% glycerol] at 4C overnight before freezing and data collection. Diffraction data were collected on beamline SBC-19ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories, and processed using DENZO and Scalepack in the HKL suite of programs (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). alous Scattering (SIRAS) was used to solve the structure with this single site mercury derivative. Initial phases were calculated by the program SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999), and initial maps calculated following density modification by RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2000). The model was built using O (Jones et al., 1991), and refinement was conducted using CNS (Brünger et al., 1998). There were three regions, the final four residues, residues 28 and 29, and residues 111­116, where the electron density was poor, resulting in high B factors and less reliable structure. The three non-LasI residues at the N-terminus, numbered Gly397, Ser398 and His399, which remain after thrombin cleavage of the N-terminal His6-tag, coordinate a zinc ion (Z405) through backbone amide nitrogen atoms and His399 Nd1. The coordinates have been submitted to the PDB and have been assigned the ID number 1RO5. The structures of LasI and EsaI were aligned and r.m.s.d. determined using LSQMAN and visually inspected using O. Figures were prepared using BOBSCRIPT, MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), Raster3D, PyMOL (DeLano Scientific) and Photoshop (Adobe).

AHL extraction and LasR reporter assays
Site-directed LasI mutants were produced in pViet by standard mutagenesis methods (Quickchange; Stratagene). SA1503(DE3) cells expressing LasIDG or its mutant derivatives were grown overnight in 5 ml of Luria­Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin at 37C. Overnight culture (0.2 ml) was diluted into 10 ml of the same broth and grown to an OD600 of 0.6­0.8. The temperature was immediately adjusted to 25C, and protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM for 8 h. Cells and supernatant were harvested by centrifugation. All glassware was acid washed two to three times with concentrated HCl, rinsed two to three times with H2O, washed two to three times with either methanol (OPTIMA, Fisher) or acidified (0.1 ml l-1 acetic acid) ethyl acetate (99.8% HPLC, Sigma) and tested for AHL contamination. Cell culture supernatants were filtered (0.2 mm; Nalgene) and extracted 2¥ with 10 ml of acidified ethyl acetate. Extracts were dried by Speed Vac, transferred to glass vials and stored frozen at -20C. To ensure accurate measurement, all liquid transfer of organic solvents was performed using Hamilton syringes washed as above. Each extract was resuspended in 0.1 ml of methanol, and dilutions were made by using varying amounts of a single 1:500 diluted stock (2 ml of extract to 998 ml of methanol) to avoid serial dilutions. Three experiments were carried out in triplicate, with extracts from two independent bacterial growths at the level of 1:100 dilution, which provided the best sensitivity without saturation of the signal from LasIDG. Western blot (not shown) confirmed that all mutants produced equivalent soluble enzyme as the LasIDG in small-scale purifications, with the exception of R172A that produced slightly higher levels of protein. The LasR reporter strain E. coli MG4/pKDT17a (Pearson et al., 1994; Schaefer et al., 2000) was grown overnight in A medium (Schaefer et al., 2000) supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4 and 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin at 30C. Each extract was incubated with 1 ml of diluted culture (diluted to an OD 600 of

0.1) for 5­6 h at 30C. The samples were then placed on ice for 20 min, and diluted 1:10 into Z buffer (0.06 M Na2HPO4, 0.04 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M KCl, 0.001 M Mg2SO4 and 0.05 M b-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). Cells were permeablized to the b-galactosidase substrate ONPG by the addition of 20 ml of chloroform and 10 ml of 0.1% SDS (Giacomini et al., 1992), and vortexed for 10 s. After 5 min, 4 mg ml-1 ONPG in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) was added to each reaction. The reactions were stopped with 0.5 ml of 1 M Na2CO3 when sufficient yellow colour had developed. Each reaction was centrifuged for 5 min at 16k g to pellet the cells, and the absorbance of the remaining undiluted culture was measured at OD600, and the reactions were measured at OD420. Miller units were calculated using the formula below (Miller, 1972): 1000 ¥ (OD420/OD600 ¥ v ¥ t), where v is the volume (in ml) of the dilution (0.1 in this case) and t is the time of the reaction in minutes.
