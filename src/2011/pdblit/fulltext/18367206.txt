Abstract
L-Lactate oxidase (LOX) from Aerococcus viridans is a member of the a-hydroxyacid-oxidase flavoenzyme family. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of LOX and revealed the mechanism of substrate recognition. The LOX monomer structure has a typical a8/b8 motif commonly found in other flavin family proteins. A related enzyme, glycolate oxidase, catalyzes the oxidation of glycolate rather than lactate. Comparison of the two enzyme structures highlights the importance of five residues around the FMN prosthetic group of LOX, which act synergistically to discriminate between the L/D configurations of lactate. X-ray crystallography of ∞ ∞ LOX gave a space group I422 of unit-cell parameters a = b = 191.096 A, c = 194.497 A and a = b = c = 90∞ with four monomers per asymmetric unit. The four independent monomers display slight structural differences around the active site. Diffraction data were col∞ lected, under cryogenic conditions to 2.1 A resolution at the synchrotron facilities in Japan. ” 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The a-hydroxyacid oxidases are a group of flavoproteins that catalyze the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent oxidation of their respective substrates. The striking similarity in the catalytic properties of these oxidases, together with the presence of common structural motifs, suggests the enzymes constitute a distinct family. The known members of this family are lactate dehydrogenase (flavocytochrome b2) [1], L-lactate monooxygenase [2], glycolate oxidase [3], L-mandelate dehydrogenase [4], and long-chain a-hydroxyacid oxidase [5]. Within the family, the crystal structures of glycolate oxidase [6], flavocytochrome b2 [7], and the chimeric form of L-mandelate dehydrogenase [8] have been solved. Comparison of these structures reveal,

similar protein folding patterns with each monomeric unit consisting of eight a-helices and eight b-strands in a typical a/b barrel arrangement, and with the FMN prosthetic group located at the C-terminal end of the b-strands. L-Lactate oxidase (LOX) from Aerococcus viridans catalyzes the oxidation of L-lactate using molecular oxygen to generate pyruvate and H2O2 [9]. The flavoprotein displays a high level of substrate specificity and is able to differentiate between L-lactate and glycolate. The reaction mechanism and substrate specificity of a-hydroxyacid oxidases are based on the interaction of FMN with the respective substrate and adjacent amino acid residues in the active site. Therefore, determination of the three-dimensional structure of LOX is an important step in facilitating a more detailed mechanistic study of these flavoenzymes. Two Arg residues of LOX, Arg181 and Arg268, are conserved in all of the a-hydroxyacid

Y. Umena et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 350 (2006) 249≠256 search model. Self- and cross-rotation functions indicated the enzyme forms a tetramer. Thus, an initial search model was generated to a tetramer with non-crystallographic symmetry. All refinements were carried out using CNS and CCP4:REFMAC5 [15]. The structure was visualized and modified using XtalView [16] and Coot [17]. A refined model of wild-type LOX consisted of four molecules (Wild-A, wild-B, wild-C, and wild-D). The model geometry was analyzed with PROCHECK [18]. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entries 2DU2, rcsb025843). Analysis for sequences and molecules. A multiple sequence alignment of wild-type LOX, glycolate oxidase (GOX), and L-lactate monooxygenase (LMO) was carried out in our previous report [9]. LSQKAB [19] in the program package CCP4 [20] was used for superposition of all the coordinates. The structures of wild-A, wild-B, wild-C, and wild-D could be superimposed between equivalent regions.

oxidase family members. Based on the X-ray crystal structure of glycolate oxidase and flavocytochrome b2, these two Arg residues are located in the vicinity of the FMN cofactor and are likely to form part of the substrate-binding site. We made a mutant of LOX in which Arg181 is replaced by Met (LOX≠R181M) in order to determine the effect of removing the positive charge at this position [10]. Although the reactivity of LOX≠R181M containing reduced FMN with oxygen was almost the same as wild-type enzyme, the efficiency of reduction of oxidized FMN by L-lactate was much lower [10]. These results demonstrate the participation of Arg181 in both the binding of substrate and in influencing the properties and reactivity of the active-site FMN. We previously reported the crystallization of wild-type enzyme, but the quality of the crystals was insufficient to solve the structure [11]. However, the crystallization of LOX≠R181M with a small amount of additive reagent did yield high quality crystals for structural analysis. Here, we describe the crystal structure of wild-type LOX obtained by the same crystallization method used for the LOX≠R181M mutant. Based on the determined structure, we discuss the mechanism of substrate recognition by LOX. Experimental procedures
Purification of the L-lactate oxidase from Aerococcus viridans. Wildtype L-lactate oxidase (LOX) from A. viridans was purified to homogeneity as described previously [11]. Prior to crystallization the enzyme was passed through a Sephacryl S-200HR (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) column and then concentrated to 20 mg ml¿1 in 50 mM Tris≠HCl, pH 8.0, using a Centricon YM-10 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The protein concentration was determined using a molecular extinction coefficient at 456 nm of 11.0 ∑ 103 M¿1 cm¿1 and a molecular weight of 40,865 [9]. Crystallization and data collection. Crystals of wild-type LOX suitable for data collection were obtained at 298 K using a sitting-drop vapor diffusion technique. The precise crystallization conditions were described in a previous report for the LOX≠R181M mutant [12]. A 2.0ll aliquot of wild-type protein solution at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (18≠20% (w/v) PEG 8000 and 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0 and an additive solution of 2% (w/v) benzamidine≠HCl). The crystals grew to full size (0.05 ∑ 0.05 ∑ 0.1 mm) after 2 weeks. Crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant (25% PEG 8000, 50 mM Tris≠HCl buffer at pH 8.0 and 10% glycerol) for a few seconds and then flash-cooled to 100 K in a stream of dry nitrogen. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamlines BL44XU (DIP6040 imaging plate detector), BL41XU (MAR CCD detector), and BL38B1 (Rigaku Jupiter 210 CCD detector) at SPring-8, and BL12NW (ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector) at the Photon Factory, Japan. The data were processed using HKL2000 and SCALEPACK [13]. The crystals of wild-type LOX belong to the tetragonal space group I422, with unit-cell parameters ∞ a = b = 191.096, c = 194.497 A, which is identical to the R181M mutant [12]. Because the molecular mass of wild-type enzyme is 41 kDa, we assume there to be four monomers per asymmetric unit and thus 64 monomers in a unit cell, resulting in a Matthews coefficient (VM) of ∞ 2.71 A3 Da¿1 and a solvent content of 50.4%. Structure determination and refinement. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the program CNS [14]. Glycolate oxidase (Protein Data Bank entry 1GOX), which has 35.4% sequence identity to LOX at the amino acid level, was used as an initial

Results Overall structure of the L-lactate oxidase from A. viridans Wild-type LOX crystals belong to space group I422 with 64 molecules in a unit cell and four molecules per asymmetric unit (Fig. 1a). The overall fold (Fig. 1b) of the LOX monomer was a (b/a)8-barrel first observed in a triose-phosphate isomerase [21]. A schematic drawing of the structure is given in Fig. 2. The helices and strands corresponding to the canonical a/b barrel have been numbered a1 (residues 105≠116), a2 (129≠136), a3 (151≠164), a4 (224≠233), a5 (246≠255), a6 (276≠287), a7 (302≠311), a8 (331≠352), b1 (89≠91), b2 (118≠122), b3 (144≠145), b4 (169≠172), b5 (238≠241), b6 (259≠262), b7 (293≠295), and b8 (315≠319). The N-terminal region has some helices and strands; aA (residues 22≠32), aB (35≠42), aC (49≠60), bB (78≠80), and bC (83≠85). aG (357≠362) is located in the C-terminal region. bB and

bC are located at the bottom of the barrel where they form an anti-parallel b-sheet lid structure. Three helices, aC 0 (residues 97≠100), aD (182≠187), and aF (320≠328), are inserted into the (b/a) repetition (b1≠a1, b4≠a4, and b8≠a8) in the barrel. The aD helix connects b4 to a4 with a long flexible chain (residues 188≠223) and this region is located at the top of the barrel. These secondary structures are common to the four monomers of LOX. The r.m.s. deviations of the main chain among the four monomers, excluding the terminal regions (1≠ 21, 363≠374) and flexible regions (173≠225, 263≠275), ∞ ∞ were 0.701 A (wild-A/B; maximum), 0.621 A (wild-A/ ∞ (wild-A/D), 0.451 A (wild-B/C), 0.513 A ∞ ∞ C), 0.635 A ∞ (wild-C/D; minimum). These (wild-B/D), and 0.421 A calculations suggest that wild-A differs slightly amongst the other three monomers. Quarternary structure of the enzyme Molecular exclusion chromatography using Sephadex G-100 initially suggested that wild-type LOX exists as a tetramer in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of 0.2 M potassium chloride [22]. Furthermore, our LOX crystals possess four monomers per asymmetric unit, suggesting that the enzyme is catalytically active as a tetramer in solution. Wild-type LOX forms a tetramer with a non-crystallographic fourfold symmetry in the center of the tetramer (Fig. 1a). Four C-terminal regions and aC helices are gathered into the center of the tetramer. The barrel of the monomer is inclined by about 45∞ to the non-crystallographic fourfold axis. The N-terminal flexible region and aA, aB helices are located at one side (`back side') of the tetramer, where they form a depression. Glycolate oxidase (GLO) also crystallizes with space group I422(6), but in this case a non-crystallographic unit is occupied by just one monomer. The crystal packing of GLO yields an octamer with a strict crystallographic symmetry. Two tetramers of GLO are related by a twofold axis of symmetry so that the depression area of each tetramer is covered by the apposing tetramer. Comparison of the amino acid sequence and Tertiary structure of LOX and GLO The three related enzymes LOX, GLO, and lactate monooxygenase are composed of a similar number of amino acids (374, 369, and 393, respectively). Amino acid residues that form the binding pocket for the FMN cofactor are well-conserved between the three enzymes. The conserved residues are located at the top of the barrel, at least for LOX and GLO which have a determined structure. GLO has no chain in this region of the protein (189≠197, GLO). The superposition of LOX and GLO shows a slight discrepancy in the barrel, the r.m.s. deviation between the two barrels being ∞ 1.40 A.

Comparison of the temperature factors among LOX and GLO Fig. 3 shows the temperature factors for each monomer of LOX. Each monomer of the LOX tetramer has a common distribution of temperature factors, except for some flexible regions (1≠10 and 190≠210). The temperature factors of the central region of the tetramer are relatively low compared with the molecular surface of the tetramer. In each monomer, segments of the sequence (residues 46≠62, 240≠245, 276≠281, and 296≠ 311) were regarded as internal regions of the tetramer. The average value of temperature factors for such amino acid residues was 10.066, compared to a total average value of 17.344. This feature is also evident for the respective monomers. By contrast, however, there is no such distribution of temperature factors at equivalent regions of the GLO monomer (i.e., 20.684 for residues 30≠46, 229≠234, 265≠270, and 286≠301, and 27.190 for the overall average). Comparison of the residues around the active site Based on the r.m.s. deviations, no significant structural differences were evident between the four monomers that make up the tetramer. Thus, each monomer does not undergo independent movement with respect to the tetramer. The superimposed structures of LOX and GLO (Fig. 4) display conserved regions surrounding amino acids, Y40, R181, and H265 (numbering corresponds to LOX). The catalytic mechanism of LOX was discussed in

our previous report [9]. The following amino acids play critical roles in the reaction mechanism of GLO: Y24, Y129, R164, K230, H254, R257, R289, and R309. Our structure of LOX shows that these residues are well-conserved: Y40, Y146, R181, K241, H265, R268, R300, and R320. Discussion Molecular structure of the L-lactate oxidase The tertiary structure of wild-type LOX has a typical b8/a8 barrel structure with some extra helices and strands. The quaternary structure of the enzyme is a tetramer in which each of the four monomers adopts an almost identical structure. Flavin enzymes may adopt a typical b8/a8 barrel structure, such as flavocytochrome b2 flavin domain and GLO. Although GLO is frequently used as a model for the analysis of LOX, the complete structure of LOX is slightly twisted around the axis of the barrel when each FMN group is fitted. The lid region may act to stabilize the enzyme when it selects lactate as substrate rather than glycolate. The Km value of the LOX mutant R181M is larger than that of the wild-type enzyme. The single amino acid substitution R181M affects amino acid residues near the FMN group, but does not interfere with the formation of tetramer. Consequently, the larger Km value of the mutant is a result of an alteration in the region of the active site that specifically interacts with the substrate, without there being major structural changes to the surrounding amino acid residues.

Substrate recognition of L-lactate oxidase The LOX enzyme catalyzes the conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate mediated by the FMN group. The Arg268, His265, and Tyr40 are critical for the mechanism of catalysis as shown in the schematic representation of the reaction in Fig. 5. The tetramer is associated with 1110 water molecules, 904 of which are located inside the enzyme. Interestingly, two water molecules were found in the active site cavity of each monomer: 5647 and 5694 for wild-A; 5139 and 5125 wild-B; 5455 and 5040 wild-C; 5585 and 5447 wild-D. The water molecules 5694, 5125, 5040, and 5447 are close to the three residues, Y40, R268, and R181, respectively. Water molecules 5647, 5139, 5455, and 5040 are surrounded by residues Y215, H265, and R181, respectively (Fig. 6a). Structural analysis

of flavocytochrome b2 and the pyruvate complex suggests the pyruvate product is located close to the FMN group. Superimposed structures of pyruvate-bound flavocytochrome b2 and LOX show that the two water molecules in the active site of LOX are located in an equivalent position to pyruvate in flavocytochrome b2. Therefore, in the absence of L-lactate, the two water molecules occupy the active site of LOX. The reaction mechanism of GLO [6] involves the FMN cofactor accepting the electron from glycolate. Although lactate differs from glycolate only by the presence of an additional methyl group, the two compounds are markedly different in terms of dipole moment and occupancy of space around the FMN group. LOX contains sufficient space to house lactate but not glycolate. The structure of the active site of LOX includes space for L-lactate on the FMN plane

surrounding residues at least Y40, Y146, and H265. The geometrical arrangement of these residues provides compelling evidence for the location of the L-lactate substrate. Although the Y215 and L211 are located in the flexible region among four monomers, at least in the wild-A the two residues may perform a plausible combination to recognize a substrate (Fig. 6a). Three OH-groups of the Tyr residues are located on the same plane supported from

both sides by H265 and L211. When H265 is on the right side of the plane, L211 should be on the left. The methyl moiety of L-lactate, being hydrophobic, is fixed by L211 on the left-hand side of the plane when lactate is located on the FMN (Fig. 6b), thereby providing specific substrate recognition. When the carboxyl moiety of L-lactate is orientated close to Y40 (top of Fig. 6b) with the hydroxyl oxygen facing toward H265, the position of the methyl group is dictated by L211. Thus, the three Tyr residues (Y40, Y146, and Y215) together with H265 and L211 of LOX function synergistically to determine the chirality of the substrate. GLO displays no such D/L specificity for substrate even though the enzyme has a similar configuration of Tyr and His residues (Y24, Y129, and H254) in the active site. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA is the link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In bacteria, L-lactate oxidase is also a critical intermediate in primary metabolism. Here we have determined the structure of LOX and proposed the mechanism of substrate specificity for D/L-lactate. To fully characterize the catalytic mechanism of LOX at atomic resolution it will be necessary to determine the three-dimensional structures of LOX with L-lactate or pyruvate.
