The DNA duplex 5' d(GCCACCAGCTC)-d(GAGCTGGTGGC) corresponds to the sequence 29 to 39 of the K-ras gene, which contains a hot spot for mutations. This has been studied by one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, energy minimization and molecular dynamics. The results show that it adopts a globally B-DNA type structure. We have introduced, at the central base-pair, the mismatches C·A and A·G. The mismatch position is that of the first base of the Gly12 codon, the hot spot. For the C·A mismatch we observe a structural change as a function of pH with an apparent pKa of 7.2. At low pH, the mismatch pair adopts a structure close to a classic wobble conformation with the cytidine residue displaced into the major groove. It is stabilised by two hydrogen bonds in which the adenosine residue is protonated and the cytidine residue has a significant C3'-endo population. At high pH, the mispair structure is in equilibrium between wobble and reverse wobble conformations. Similar studies are reported on the A·G mismatch, which also undergoes a transition as a function of pH. 31P spectra have been recorded on all systems and as a function of pH. No evidence for BII phosphodiester backbone conformations was found. The NMR results are well corroborated by molecular dynamics calculations performed with or without distance constraints. The dynamics at the mismatch sites have been examined. Although the overall structures are close to B-DNA, helical parameters fluctuate differently at these sites. Different hydrogen bonding alternatives in dynamic equilibrium that can involve three-centred hydrogen bonds are observed.

Mismatched base-pairs in DNA in vivo arise as a consequence of base modification, such as deamination of 5-methyl cytosine, heteroduplex formation during homologous genetic recombination and errors resulting from misincorporation of bases

during DNA replication. Mismatches are not corrected with equal frequency (Lacks et al., 1982; Claverys et al., 1983; Lu et al., 1983; Kramer et al., 1984; Dohet et al., 1985; Fazakerley et al., 1986). In Escherichia coli, the repair efficiency depends on the type of mismatch, on the surrounding sequence (Kramer et al., 1984; Dohet et al., 1985) and correlates qualitatively with the affinity of the MutS protein for the mismatch (Su et al., 1988). Transition mismatches (G·T and C·A) are well repaired, while three of the six transversion mismatches (G·A, C·C and C·T) are not well repaired. These differences may arise from the ease with which the repair machinery recognises the pairing as being mismatched. Recognition may involve specific contacts formed between MutS and the mismatch site, changes in the local structure or both. If the enzymatic systems that are specialized in

the repair of mismatches fail to recognize and rectify errors in DNA, the result will be the introduction of a mutation into a daughter molecule, with potentially fatal consequences such as cancer in eukaryotic organisms. One of the oncogenes most frequently found in human cancers is the ras oncogene (Tong et al., 1991). The proteins encoded by these genes are called p21, have a molecular mass of about 21,000 Da with 188 or 189 amino acid residues highly conserved during evolution. The difference between the normal ras proto-oncogene and the activated ras oncogenes is usually a single base change at one of a few critical positions, resulting in a single amino acid substitution in p21 (de Vos et al., 1988). For example, a glycine residue at position 12 of the ras protein is required for its normal function. Changing the residue to any other except proline will produce an activated mutant. There are different explanations for mutation at a particular position: some DNA sequences may present particular base positions as easy targets to mutagenic agents or DNA sequences may hide mutagenic lesions from repair activity so that the lesions persist. In order to attempt to provide an answer, we have conducted studies on the sequence 29 to 39 of the K-ras gene, which contains the Gly12 codon. To better understand the mechanism of mismatch recognition and its influence on the duplex we have studied first the natural sequence and then the system in which the central C·G base-pair is replaced by a C·A base-pair. The mismatch position is that of the first base of the Gly12 codon. Here, we report NMR, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations on these systems. We previously reported (Carbonnaux et al., 1991) a qualitative study on the A·G mismatch at the same position in the duplex. Additional NMR experiments have been made as well as molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations.

Results and Discussion
The C·G duplex

Assignment of the non-exchangeable proton resonances
We have recorded a series of 1D spectra at different temperatures to determine the best experimental conditions at pH 7.2. The tm of the oligonucleotide is found to be 73°C. We therefore chose to study the duplex at 30°C. The assignment of the non-exchangeable proton resonances was obtained from analysis of a NOESY spectrum recorded with a 400 millisecond mixing time and TOCSY spectra in 2H2 O. The H(8) /H(6)-H(1') / H(5) region of the NOESY spectrum recorded at 30°C, pH 7.2 is shown in Figure 1. Eight strong cross-peaks (marked X) corresponding to the H(5)-H(6) interactions are observed and identify the eight cytidine residues. Starting from G1H(8) (7.92 p.p.m.), we can follow the classical chain of connectivities for a right-handed

B-DNA helix to C11H(6) (7.52 p.p.m.). From G12H(8) , we can do the same to C22H(6) . The eight interbase cross-peaks (A to H in Figure 1) correspond to the H(6) /H(8)-H(5) (n + 1) interactions. The A13H(2) resonance at 7.78 p.p.m. exhibits cross-peaks with its own H(1') , the C11H(1') and the adjacent G14H(1') . The two other H(2) protons, A4H(2) and A7H(2) , exhibit cross-peaks with their own H(1') , and a stronger one with the adjacent H(1') in the 3' direction. The interbase interactions are characteristic of righthanded B-DNA. This assignment is confirmed in the H(6) /H(8)-H(2') /H(2") /CH3 region of the same NOESY spectrum (not shown). The relative assignment of the H(2') and H(2") resonances was obtained from analysis of the H(1')-H(2') /H(2") region of a NOESY spectrum recorded with a 60 millisecond mixing time. The complete assignment of the H(3') and H(4') resonances was obtained from analysis of the TOCSY spectrum (not shown). Distance constraints were derived for the initial NOE buildup slopes in the series of short mixing time spectra. The observed chemical shifts are given in Table 1.

Assignment of the exchangeable proton resonances
Figure 2 shows two regions of the 250 millisecond NOESY spectrum recorded in H2 O at 1°C and pH 7.2. The lower part of Figure 2 shows imino-imino interactions. The resonance at 13.74 p.p.m. shows clearly interactions with two G imino protons. In the upper part of Figure 2, this imino proton shows a strong cross-peak with an AH(2) resonance at about 7.7 p.p.m., which could be A13H(2) or A4H(2) . Moreover, this imino proton shows two cross-peaks

with two CH(5) protons, which have already been identified as C5H(5) (5.25 p.p.m.) and C3H(5) (5.64 p.p.m.). So the imino resonance must correspond to T19, and the T imino resonance at 14.03 p.p.m. can be assigned to T10 from the NOE wth A13H(2) . The cross-peak observed with a G imino resonance at 12.84 p.p.m. must be that with G14 as none would be expected with a terminal G residue. The remaining T imino resonance is that of T16. The pairs of amino resonances (C and A) shown in Figure 2 are confirmed by examination of the amino-amino region (not shown). At this point three cross-peaks remain unassigned. Two of them correspond to the chemical shift of the imino protons of G8 and G14 with a resonance at 5.85 p.p.m. (cross-peaks A and B). The imino proton of the terminal residues G1 and G12 could be identified in the 1D spectrum at 13.07 and 12.65 p.p.m., respectively (not shown). So the resonance at 5.85 p.p.m. cannot correspond to the amino group of a terminal guanine residue as observed previously (Carbonnaux et al., 1990; Boulard et al., 1992). Another explanation is that these interactions arise from the amino group of G8 or G14 to their imino protons. If we can expect such cross-peaks for a terminal residue due to fraying it is difficult to explain for a non-terminal residue. It has been shown (van de Ven et al., 1988; Liepinsh et al., 1992) that NOE interactions between non-exchangeable protons and exchangeable protons could be observed by spin diffusion via water molecules. In this system the H(1') protons of C9 and C15 are overlapping at 5.85 p.p.m. Analysis of the imino-H(2') /H(2") /CH3 region (not shown) shows cross-peaks between the imino protons of G14 and G8 and the H(2') /H(2") protons of C9 and C15. We note that this type of interaction is also visible for other residues but they are less

intense and in these cases we do not observe interactions between the imino proton and the H(1') proton. The third cross-peak to identify corresponds to the interaction between the imino proton at 13.07 p.p.m. (G21 or G1) and a resonance at 6.05 p.p.m. (cross-peak C). The most likely explanation is that this interaction is between the amino group of G1 and its imino proton as observed previously for a terminal residue. In order to probe in more detail the structure of the duplex, NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 40, 50, 60 and 80 milliseconds. The initial build up rates were measured and converted into inter-proton distances (Cuniasse et al., 1987) for model building studies. From the magnitude of H(8) /H(6)-H(1') NOEs, all residues must be in an anti conformation. These spectra were also used to determine the major sugar puckering from the base proton-H(2') /H(3') NOEs (Cuniasse et al., 1989). These results were confirmed by analysis of the phase-sensitive COSY spectra. Except for the terminal residues, all sugars show interactions corresponding to a predominantly C2'-endo conformation. All these results show that the native sequence adopts a standard right-handed B-type DNA conformation in solution, with all base-pairs in a normal WatsonCrick conformation.

The C·A duplex The 1D spectra recorded at different pH values clearly revealed two pH-dependent structures for the C·A duplex. To determine the pK transition, we have followed the chemical shift of the A17H(8) base proton as a function of pH. The apparent pK of the transition is found to be 7.20. We therefore chose to

study the structures of the C·A duplex at pH 5.2 and 8.5, close to the ends of the transition.

In this duplex, we measured a sum S1' of 13.4 Hz for the deoxyribose of C6, which indicates approximately 63% of S-type sugar rings (see Table 2). This is in contrast with the conformational predominance of the S-type sugar rings for the other non-terminal residues, which are in the range 80 to 90%. Distance constraints were derived as for the duplex C·G. The observed chemical shifts are given in Table 3.

Study at pH 5.2 Assignment of the non-exchangeable proton resonances . The tm of the C·A duplex at pH 5.2 is 56°C. This value is 17°C below that of the natural sequence, demonstrating that the C·A mismatch destabilizes the duplex. As for the C·G duplex, we observe normal intra and inter-residue interactions for the two strands in the H(8) /H(6)-H(1') /H(5) and H(8) /H(6)-H(2') /H(2") /CH3 regions of a NOESY spectrum recorded at 30°C and pH 5.2. The C and A bases of the mismatch stack into the helix and the duplex adopts a globally B-DNA structure. The intensities of the H(8) /H(6)-H(1') cross-peaks show that all the bases including C6 and A17 are in a normal anti conformation. We have previously shown (Boulard et al., 1992) a significant

Assignment of the exchangeable proton resonances . In the 1D spectrum recorded as a function of temperature at pH 5.2 (not shown), we observe, at 7°C, three resonances in the region for T imino protons and at least five resonances corresponding to the G imino protons. Additionally, we observe a broad resonance around 9.3 p.p.m. Lowering the pH to 4.0 has no effect upon the line width of this resonance indicating that it is not broadened by exchange with the solvent. When we raise the temperature its line-width narrows from 350 Hz at 7°C to 120 Hz at 42°C. At 27°C we can observe a second resonance at 6.9 p.p.m. that, as for the resonance at 9.3 p.p.m., sharpens with increasing temperature. This suggests that the protons corresponding to both resonances undergo a similar proton exchange phenomenon that influences their

line-widths, and that these protons belong to the same base-pair. Integration of the peak at 9.3 p.p.m. relative to another at 8.53 p.p.m. (which corresponds to one proton, see below) shows that it corresponds to two protons. It is difficult to integrate the second resonance at 6.9 p.p.m. but it probably corresponds also to two protons. These two resonances, at 9.3 p.p.m. and 6.9 p.p.m., correspond to exchangeable protons as they are not observed in 2H2 O. The assignment of the exchangeable proton resonances was obtained in the usual way from analysis of the NOESY spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 250 milliseconds. Two regions are shown in Figure 3. From the resonance at 9.3 p.p.m. we observe two cross-peaks, one with the imino proton of T16 at 13.66 p.p.m. and the other with the imino proton of G18 at 12.79 p.p.m. These interactions demonstrate unambiguously that the amino resonance at 9.3 p.p.m. belongs to the mismatch site. As in the natural duplex, we observe cross-peaks between a resonance at 5.85 p.p.m. and

the imino protons of G8 and G14 (peaks A and B). Furthermore an additional cross-peak between the resonance at 5.85 p.p.m. and the imino proton of T16 is revealed (peak C). For the reasons described above we can assign the resonance at 5.85 p.p.m. to the two overlapping C15H(1') and C9H(1') protons. Finally, there is a cross-peak between the imino proton of G18 and a resonance at 5.57 p.p.m. (peak D), which can arise only from the H(1') proton of C6. We have recorded 1D difference spectra to assign the resonance at 9.3 p.p.m. (Figure 4). Presaturation of the peak at 9.3 p.p.m. results in significant NOEs to the imino protons of T16 and G18, the amino protons of C5, the H(2) proton of A17 and a weak NOE to the resonance at 6.9 p.p.m. Presaturation of the imino proton of T16 results in NOEs to the imino proton of G8, the H(2) proton of A7, the amino protons of C15 and the resonance at 9.3 p.p.m. We have also carried out a 1D experiment with presaturation of the resonance at 6.9 p.p.m., but if we clearly see a NOE to the C6H(5) resonance, selective presaturation is not possible and this result cannot be interpreted unambiguously. As a function of pH, we observe a structural change indicating that protonation is occurring at low pH. The resonances at 6.9 and 9.3 p.p.m. belong to the mismatch site and identify the amino groups of the C·A base-pair. We observe a strong down-field shift of the A17H(8) relative to the neutral structure as predicted for base protonation (Sowers et al., 1986). In the same way, it has been

demonstrated (Raszka, 1974) that base protonation results in large down-field shifts for the amino protons. Similar results have been observed for the amino protons of protonated bases in triple-stranded structures (Rajagopal & Feigon, 1989; de los Santos et al., 1989; Sklenar & Feigon, 1990; Mooren et al., 1990; Macaya et al., 1992). Further evidence that A17 is protonated is found by comparison with our previous study on a 7-mer duplex containing a C·A mismatch (Boulard et al., 1992). The amino protons of A and C were found at 9.5 p.p.m. and 6.9 p.p.m., respectively, and we concluded that the adenine residue was protonated. Finally, it has been demonstrated unambiguously (Wang et al., 1991) by 15 N NMR spectroscopy that the A residue in a C·A mispair is protonated at acidic pH. This leads to the conclusion that the 9.3 p.p.m. resonance corresponds to the amino group of A17. The 6.9 p.p.m. resonance must therefore be assigned to the C6 amino group. The two resonances of the A17 amino group are collapsed at 9.3 p.p.m. This demonstrates that rotation round the C-N bond is faster in the C·A+ mismatch in comparison with a T·A base-pair, where the amino protons of the A are individually observed by NMR. In the same sequence containing the A·G mismatch we have been able to observe, at 16 p.p.m., the additional proton in the structure A+·G, protonated on N(1) at pH 5.0 (Carbonnaux et al., 1991). We do not observe a resonance corresponding to the additional proton in this study even when lowering the pH to 4.0. This may be due to greater solvent accessibility or more frequent base-pair opening in the case of a purine·pyrimidine mismatch relative to a purine·purine mismatch. All the amino protons other than those of the G residues and of A7 have been identified.

Study at pH 8.5
At pH 8.5, the duplex is clearly destabilized with a tm of about 49°C or about 7°C below that at pH 5.2. This result shows a striking correlation between duplex stability and proton concentration, further supporting a protonated base-pair at low pH.

with the global structure of a B-DNA helix. The structural perturbation at the C5-C6 step could be due to a shift of the base C6 that increases the C6H(6)-C5H(2') (H(2") ) distance in order to better accommodate the C·A mismatch in the helix. From the other end of the strand, C11, we can follow the chain to the C6H(6)-C6H(2') (H(2") ) intraresidue crosspeaks. We observe normal intra and inter-residue cross-peaks for the second strand. We can therefore conclude that both C6 and A17 are stacked into the helix. The intensities of the H(8) /H(6)-H(1') cross-peaks in a NOESY spectrum recorded with a short mixing time show that all the bases are in a normal anti conformation. At high pH, the C6 sugar reverts to a predominantly C2'-endo conformation as are all other residues (Table 2). Distance constraints were determined as described above.

Assignment of the non-exchangeable proton resonances . The H(8) /H(6)-H(2') /H(2") /CH3 region of the NOESY spectrum recorded at 23°C, pH 8.5 in 2H2 O is shown in Figure 5. From G1, we can follow the normal intra and inter-residues interactions to C5, but here the chain is broken. We do not observe the cross-peak C6H(6)-C5H(2') , even in the NOESY spectrum with a long mixing time. In a long mixing time NOESY spectrum, we would expect that the interaction H(6) (n)-H(2') (n - 1) would be dominated by spin diffusion via H(6) (n)-H(2") (n - 1). This latter cross-peak, if present, overlaps with that of C6H(6)-H(2") . However, in order to account for the absence of a cross-peak with C5H(2') , the interaction C6H(6)-C5H(2') must be abnormally weak. In a normal B-DNA helix the distance between H(6) (n)-H(2') (n - 1) ° (about 3.9 A) proton is greater than H(6) (n)-H(2") (n - 1) ° (about 2.4 A). So this observation is not inconsistent

Spectra in water . On raising the pH from 5.4 to 8.5, we observe the rapid disappearance of the 9.3 p.p.m. broad resonance. We observe that, except for the terminal base-pairs, which exchange rapidly due to fraying, the imino proton of T16 is the first to exchange with the solvent. This indicates greater solvent accessibility for the A·T imino proton adjacent to the mismatch relative to, for example, the penultimate base-pair T10·A13. We do not observe this on the other side of the mismatch site, the G18 imino proton resonance moves but is not selectively broadened as a function of pH. Destabilization appears to be greater on one side of the mismatch site than on the other. We have attempted to record 2D spectra in H2 O but at this high pH the imino protons are too broad due to exchange with the solvent. We have not been able to obtain any additional structural information from

these spectra. The proton chemical shifts are given in Table 3. Phosphodiester backbone To obtain additional structural information about the backbone chain (Gorenstein, 1984; Prive et al., ´ 1987), we have recorded 31P 1D NMR spectra of the different duplexes at different temperatures and pH. In all the cases, we find that the 31P chemical shift dispersion is small, about 0.9 p.p.m., with poor resolution. We have not observed, even in the A·G duplex, a 31P resonance of a phosphate group down-field from the phosphate signals in the BI conformation (Nikonowicz & Gorenstein, 1990; Chou et al., 1992). Thus, if we cannot exclude the presence of phosphate in the BII conformation, it can correspond to only a minor form. Molecular modelling

correspond to a B-DNA without significant deviation. The trajectories of helical parameters (shear, stretch, stagger, buckle, propeller twist and opening) for the C·G pair during MDI are displayed in Figure 6(a) to (f). The length of a Watson-Crick hydrogen bond as a function of time and its distribution is plotted in Figure 6(g) and (h). All these plots show the extent of fluctuations that are very similar to any other C·G non-terminal base-pairs in the oligonucleotide. The only peculiarity of the C·G duplex is a curvature that requires a more detailed structural study (see the accompanying paper).

C·G duplex
Energy refinements with or without NOE distance constraints give essentially the same final structure in excellent agreement with NMR data. Pucker restraints are required, however, at the first energy refinement stage. For the molecular dynamics MDI where the NMR distance restraints were included, the force constant used in distance restraints is sufficient to guarantee excellent agreement between NMR distances and their averages during MDI. MDII differs from MDI by slightly larger fluctuation amplitudes due to the absence of distance restraints. In both MD, all averages such as proton-proton distances, torsion angles and helical parameters are practically identical. In order to identify local deformations present in a duplex, with or without mismatches, we have computed reference values to detect unusual structural parameters (see following article) in MD runs. This provides a rapid method for searching for significant conformational changes in a large quantity of data. For the C·G oligonucleotide the parameters

Conformation of the C·A mispair Protonated C·A conformation . From NMR observations, the only possible pairing is a wobble-type conformation such as that shown in Figure 7(b). The cytidine residue is displaced into the major groove and the adenosine residue into the minor groove. The C·A+ mismatch, in which the N(1) of A17 is protonated, is stabilized by the presence of two hydrogen bonds. Using this starting structure, energy minimization and both MD calculations reproduce well all NMR distances. All sugar puckers are found in the C2'-endo conformation, except that of C6, which oscillates between C2' and C3'-endo. This is clearly seen in terms of the inter-proton distances for C6 in Figure 8(a) and (c), while that of A17 remains close to C2'-endo, Figure 8(b) and (d). In Figure 8(a) and (c), the intra-residue distance C6H(6)-H(2') is short when C6H(6)-H(3') is long and vice versa, and follows the variations of the sugar pucker of C6. The C·A+ mismatch is characterized by the presence of two hydrogen donors on the protonated A+ and two hydrogen acceptors on the other residue, C6. This explains why we have observed that the C·A+ base-pairing oscillates during the MD runs, between three patterns of hydrogen bonding (see Figure 7), thereby generating a large number of conformations. Oscillations occur about the classical wobble structure, W+, Figure 7(b), and the slipped structures, W+ 3 and W+ 4 , Figure 7(a) and (c). The W+ notation refers to the charged wobble pairing. We have chosen the notation W+ 3 to indicate that the cytidine residue of the classical wobble on strand I is displaced into the major groove in the positive direction along the X axis of the EMBO convention (Dickerson et al., 1989). In W+ 4 , the cytidine residue is moved into the minor groove. By 1D difference experiments, we observed a weak

JMB--MS 311 202 NOE between the amino resonances of C6 and of A17 (Figure 4(b)) suggesting a long distance between these amino groups. In our previous study of a C·A+ mismatch in a different oligonucleotide (Boulard et al., 1992), this distance was short. The distance ° between the amino groups is 2.0 A in the model + ° in W+ and 3.6 A in W+ 3 . This suggests ° W 4 , 2.6 A that the W+ 4 population was predominant in solution in the previously reported C·A+ mismatch, whereas the W+ 3 population is predominant in this duplex. The two A amino protons are generally observed as separate resonances in the region 6 to 8 p.p.m. for A·T base-pairs. We observe that the A+ amino proton resonances are collapsed, even at low temperature. Base protonation alone does not induce this (Carbonnaux et al., 1991) and suggests that hydrogen bonding to the amino group is relatively weak although rotation of the amino group is much slower than that observed for AMP (Raszka, 1974). All these observations show that the C·A+ mispair may be in equilibrium between three principal conformations. These oscillations are observed in MDI runs as shown by the time trajectory of the shear parameter and of the lengths of all possible hydrogen bonds at the C·A + mismatch, Figure 8(e) to (i). Their distribution is represented in the adjacent histograms. The fluctuations and lengths of the classical hydrogen bonds in C·A+, C6O(2)-A+17H(1) ° (2.1(20.3)A, Figure 8(f)) and C6N(3)-A+17HN(6) ° (2.5(20.4)A, Figure 8(i)) are not very much larger than for normal Watson-Crick base-pairs ° (2.05(20.15)A, Figure 6(g) and (h)). This is, however, sufficient to bring, occasionally, C6O(2) and A+17HN(6) or less often C6N(3) and A+17H(1) within hydrogenbonding distance (Figure 8(g) and (h)). Populations are in the order W+ 3 > W+ > W+ 4 as shown in Figure 8(e). Figure 8(g) and (h) show that the change of partial hydrogen bonding between W+ 3 and W+ 4 has a definite on and off character that does not conform to the usual static representation of a three-centred hydrogen bond.

Neutral C·A conformation . Various hydrogenbonding schemes for a C·A base-pair are possible, as shown in Figure 9. Two base-pairings with minor tautomer forms and two hydrogen bonds (Figure 9(a) and (b)) have been proposed (Watson & Crick, 1953; Topal & Fresco, 1976) and can be ruled out by the following observations. Firstly, we do not observe an imino proton for the mismatch site in the 11-mer C·A duplex at pH > 7. Further, we have previously shown that the change from a C·A+ base-pair to a neutral C·A base-pair or a neutral base-pair in which one of the bases adopts a rare tautomer form would give rise to significant and different chemical shift changes of the base protons (Sowers et al., 1986). The observed chemical shift changes are in agreement with a change from a C·A+ base-pair to that of a C·A neutral form that does not involve a rare tautomer form. Thirdly, the tm at pH 8.5 for the C·A duplex is 7°C below that of the duplex at pH 5.2 and is in agreement with a C·A

pairing stabilized by a single inter-base hydrogen bond. Six of the schemes postulate major tautomer forms of both bases (Figure 9(c) to (h)). Three of them possess two hydrogen bonds, of which two require a base in a syn configuration (Figure 9(c) and (d)), while this is not the case for base-pairing (Figure 9(e)). At pH 8.5, the intensity of the intraresidue NOEs H(8) /H(6)-H(1') for A17 and C6 show that the mismatched base-pairs are in the anti-anti configuration, which excludes the models shown in Figure 9(c) and (d). The remaining structure with two hydrogen bonds, Figure 9(e), fits poorly the NMR data. In particular, the A17H(8) is very far from ° T16H(1') , H(2') and H(2") (5 to 7 A) but these interactions are well observed. Furthermore, despite the energy gain due to this supplementary hydrogen bond, these molecular structures (Figure 9(c), (d) and (e)) require too much deformation at the C·A site and are not energetically favoured, as shown in Table 4.

2 The weighted x w = S(rij -dij )2/dij , where rij is the distance obtained by NMR and dij is the distance in a proposed structure, gives the overall agreement between the computed structure and the NMR data. 2 ° Since dij varies between 2 and 5 A, the function x w gives more weight to short distances that are normally measured with the best precision.

these conformations fit well the NOE data at the C·A mispair. The remaining three schemes possess a single hydrogen bond and are denoted super wobble (SW), wobble (W) and reverse wobble (RW) in Figure 9(f) to (h), respectively. SW describes a pairing configuration where the pyrimidine base is displaced into the major groove relative to the wobble conformation. In the C·A mispair, the wobble is hydrogen-bonded through C6N(3)-A17HN(6) , whereas the super wobble is hydrogen-bonded through C6O(2)-A17HN(6) . If the relative orientation of the two bases remained unchanged from that observed for the protonated base-pair, we would not expect major chemical shift differences for the protons of the central nucleotides apart from those of the base of A17 due to deprotonation. This is not the case (Table 3); certain sugar protons on both strands exhibit very large shifts. Clearly, there is a significant population of a structure very different from that of a wobble. No single measurement in the NMR data allows us to distinguish between the SW and RW structures. The overall fit, Table 4, is better for the RW or W structures than for the SW although the difference is not sufficiently large to be unambiguous. Energy minimization and MD runs have been carried out from the starting point corresponding to each of the three structures without any constraint on hydrogen bonding. Starting from the SW conformation, we observe this population to decrease rapidly giving rise to W and RW structures. The system oscillates between W and RW conformations. Very similar results are obtained when starting from either the W or the RW structures. The population of the SW structure is low, less than 5%, and those of the W and RW structures are similar. There are not three well-defined conformations but rather a family of conformations. The agreement with NMR data and the energies of the W and RW are the same and better than the SW structure, Table 4. The RW and W structures correspond to the least modified B-DNA C·A mismatched conformations. Average helical parameters feature a large opening value. This is not

unexpected, since the C·A is held together by a single hydrogen bond. The existence of an equilibrium where the W may appear while the RW conformation is predominant cannot be ruled out.

The A+·G and A·G duplexes
A qualitative NMR study of the duplex containing the A·G mismatch in the same sequence has been reported (Carbonnaux et al., 1991). The neutral and protonated structures retained for the A·G base pair as a function of pH are shown in Figure 10, structures that have been proposed previously (Gao & Patel, 1988). We have recorded a series of NOESY spectra with short mixing times at pH 4.7 and at pH 8.5 to calculate the inter-proton distances for modelbuilding studies. Comparison of the experimental distances and of the values found by computing the average with 1/r 6 weight during MDII runs is very good. Average torsion angles and helical parameters are within the range of average B-DNA as computed in the following article (accompanying paper: Cognet et al., 1995). This shows that the B-DNA structure easily accommodates an A+·G or A·G mismatch without major distortion. We observe the rare appearance of the A+·G and A·G duplex, less than 15%, of the BII conformation where the canonical values of e and z angles flip from the BI conformation into the BII conformation for the phosphate group P(5) between C5 and the mismatch. The 31P NMR spectra do not show a down-field shifted resonance for either duplex. This indicates that either all phosphate groups adopt the BI conformation or possibly there could be a minor form in the BII conformation with rapid exchange on an NMR time-scale between the two forms.

Protonated A+·G conformation . There are two hydrogen donors on the protonated A+ and two hydrogen acceptors on the G residue. This is the same as described above for the C·A+ mismatch and gives rise to the possibility of three-centred hydrogen bonds. This generates three types of hydrogen bonding patterns as represented in Figure 10(a). The

(b) The 2 conformations of the A·G mismatch without, upper and with, lower, partial hydrogen bonding.

H notation refers to Hoogsteen as this base-pairing A+·G resembles that of a Hoogsteen base-pair. During MDI and MDII runs, we observe an equilibrium between the three types of hydrogen bonding, represented in Figure 10(a). MDI computations show that the A+·G mismatch oscillates between H+ 3, H+ and H+ 4 with a variation of the ° shear of +1.3, 0 and - 1.3 A, respectively, as seen in Figure 11(a). The variation of the lengths of the inter-atomic distances of A+6H(1)-G17N(7) and A+6HN(6)-G17O(6) are represented in Figure 11(b) and (e). They are similar to the corresponding hydrogen bonds in the C·A+ mismatch (Figure 8(f) and (i)). The distances A+6H(1)-G17O(6) and A+6HN(6)-G17N(7) , Figure 11(c) and (d), follow the same pattern as for the shear parameter. The MD runs indicate that the H+ 4 conformation predominates. The only protonproton interaction that is sensitive to the lateral displacement of the bases is that between A+ 6H(1) and G17(H)(8) . We have not been able to measure accurately the NOE between these protons.

Figure 11. The time-evolution and the distribution of (a) the shear and of the hydrogen bonding recorded in MDI, for the mismatch A+·G, are given in order from the minor groove towards the major groove commencing by the first base: (b) A+6H(1)-G17N(7) ; (c) A+6H(1)-G17O(6) ; (d) A+6HN(6)-G17N(7) ; (e) A+6HN(6)-G17O(6) .

A NOE will always be observed between A+6H(1) and A+ 6H(2) and the chemical shift of the latter proton is very close to that of G17H(8) making individual quantification difficult. Nevertheless, we observed (Carbonnaux et al., 1991) a significant NOE between A+ 6H(1) and G17H(8) . In the ° H+ 3 conformation this distance is e4.0 A, whereas + ° for the H 4 conformation it is about 2.3 A, which strongly suggests that the latter is favoured over the former.

205 plotted as a function of time during MDI. We observe a dynamic equilibrium between these two types of conformations. The lengths of A6N(1)-G17H(1) and A6HN(6)-G17O(6) fluctuate about a well-defined average value as shown in Figure 12(c) and (d), respectively. On the other hand, we observe that the distance A6N(1)-G17HN(2) oscillates about the two values associated with the structures shown in Figure 10(b) and yields a broad distribution as shown in Figure 12(b). So the three-centred hydrogen bond should not be viewed in a static way but as a dynamic equilibrium between the two alternative hydrogenbonding conformations of Figure 10(b). This is similarly shown in the time-evolution of the shear parameter, Figure 12(a).

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that the oncogenic sequence containing the C·A mismatch exists in a pH-dependent equilibrium between two structures of globally B-DNA. At low pH, the mismatch adopts a C(anti )·A+(anti ) wobble structure in which the N(1) of A17 is protonated. Agreement between NMR data and computations with the sole restraints on all d angles, except at the mismatch site C·A + , is excellent. This led us to investigate the hydrogen-bonding pattern at the mismatched site during these MD runs. The hydrogen-bonding situation is peculiar, since there are two hydrogen donors on A + 17 and two hydrogen acceptors on C6. In this study, NMR data show that model W + 3 is more populated than W + or W + 4, whereas in a previous study on another sequence (Boulard et al., 1992) the reverse situation was observed. These data suggest the existence of an equilibrium between all these conformations where the predominant form is determined by the local environment of the mismatch. As in our previous studies (Cuniasse et al., 1987; Cognet et al., 1990), the conformational equilibrium between C2'-endo and C3'-endo shown by the NMR data is well corroborated by our computations. Above pH 8.0, a neutral species in which the C moves towards the minor groove is observed. This corresponds to an anti-anti reverse wobble conformation, which is in equilibrium with a classical wobble structure. We observe by molecular dynamics computations the exchange between the two conformations reverse wobble and wobble, and that the alternative super wobble structure is rarely found. The pattern of hydrogen donors and acceptors in the A+ (anti )·G(syn) mismatch is very similar to that encountered in the C·A+ mismatch. Molecular dynamics computations suggest that there is an equilibrium between three basic H+ 4, H+ , H+ 3 conformations with different partial hydrogen bonding. However, as with C·A+ we wish to emphasize that the equilibrium observed is not between three defined and rigid conformations but that between a family of structures in dynamic equilibrium. In the A(anti )·G(anti ) mismatch, a three-centred

Neutral A·G conformation . The A·G mismatch is characterized by the presence of a hydrogen acceptor and hydrogen donor on A6 and two donors and an acceptor on G17. This situation is again favourable for a three-centred hydrogen bond as explained previously (Carbonnaux et al., 1991; Leonard et al., 1992) and as shown in Figure 10(b). The lengths of the hydrogen bonds A6HN(6)-G17O(6) and A6N(1)-G17H(1) in the A·G mismatch conformation of Figure 10 (b ° upper) are 2.0 A and their geometry is classical. In ° this conformation, A6N(1)-G17HN(2) is 3.3 A and has a weaker energy than A6N(1)-G17H(1) . A small ° translation of 1 A along the X axis is sufficient to create a three-centred hydrogen-bonding pattern represented in Figure 10(b), lower. In this scheme, the length of the first two hydrogen bonds remains ° very close to 2.0 A, whereas A6N(1)-G17HN(2) can be ° less than 2.3 A. This is well visualized in Figure 12, where the length of all these hydrogen bonds is

It is also viewed as an equilibrium between different hydrogen-bonding patterns rather than a static representation. Although the substitution of the C·G base-pair by a mismatch C·A+, C·A, A+·G or A·G does not modify globally the B-DNA geometry, we observe a local deformation for the three central base-pairs. The base-pairing and the dynamics of the hydrogen bonding is profoundly modified. The structural change required to form three-centred hydrogen bonds is best viewed by the change in the shear parameter. For the C·A mismatch this can fluctuate ° by about 6 A between the limiting cases, for C·A+ and ° ° A+·G it is about 2 A and for A·G about 1 A. For all these systems all limiting cases are observed in MD runs although their relative populations can be different.

The duplexes were 4 mM in strand concentration dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl and 0.2 mM EDTA. NMR spectra were recorded on either AMX500 or AMX600 Bruker spectrometers in either 99.99% 2H2 O or 90% H2 O/10% 2H2 O. NMR measurements All spectra were acquired and plotted in the phase-sensitive mode (Bodenhausen et al., 1984). NOESY spectra were recorded without removing the sample from the probe with mixing times of 40, 50, 60, 80 and 400 milliseconds in 2H2 O and 250 milliseconds in H2 O. Distance determination from the initial build up curves was done as described (Cuniasse et al., 1987). This method takes into account the observed differences in effective correlation time for different classes inter proton vectors (Withka et al., 1990; Cognet et al., 1991). The NOESY spectrum in H2 O was acquired with the observation pulse replaced by a jump-and-return composite pulse sequence (Plateau & Gueron, 1982). The one-dimensional NOE ´ difference spectra were collected with presaturation for 250 to 500 milliseconds. For the phase-sensitive DQF COSY (Rance et al., 1984) spectra, 2048 complex points and 512 points in t1 were collected with 64 scans acquired per t1 experiment. The data set were zero-filled to 4096 and 2048 along the t2 and t1 axes and multiplied by sine bells (shifted by p/10) along both axes before two-dimensional Fourier transformation. All coupling constant measurements were made from cross sections of the 2D COSY spectra (Clark et al., 1990). Total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode (Davis & Bax, 1985) with a 60 millisecond mixing time. Molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations We have manually constructed all the mismatches under all possible pairing configurations as described (Cognet et al., 1991; Boulard et al., 1992) and as developed in the accompanying paper (Cognet et al., 1995). The initial coordinates are those of canonical B-DNA (Arnott et al., 1976). Each base of the mismatched base-pair is first attributed a reference frame. These reference frames serve to precisely position one of the bases with respect to the other. Energy minimizations, charge calculations for the protonated adenine and molecular dynamics calculations were carried out using the program AMBER (Weiner & Kollman, 1981; Weiner et al., 1984, 1986; Singh et al., 1986) as described (Boulard et al., 1992; Cognet et al., 1990). Minimizations were stopped when the root-mean-square ° of the energy gradient was less than 0.1 kcal/A. NMR distance measurements were used as restraints in molecular mechanics with a force constant of 500 kcal/ ° (mol A2 ). In order to change the sugar ring puckers it was sufficient to force the torsion angle d (C(5')-C(4')-C(3')-O(3') ) to d0 (d0 = 82° for C3'-endo and d0 = 144° for C2'-endo conformation: Dickerson et al., 1985). The torsion angle d was forced to d0 by addition of E = Sk (d - d0)2 to the energy function of AMBER. The constant k was set to 900 kcal/(mol rad2 ). All molecular dynamics were computed with the

Biological implications This study demonstrates that the C·A mismatch, as the A·G mismatch, exists in a pH-dependent equilibrium between the neutral and the protonated structures. The pKa estimated from the transition curve for the C·A mismatch is 7.2, about three pH units higher than that of free adenosine (Saenger, 1984). This demonstrates the influence of the surrounding bases and base-pairing. Its value is comparable to previous reports (Brown et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1991; Boulard et al., 1992) and close to physiological pH (Bright et al., 1987). In the cell, we can expect that both the neutral and protonated species exist in equilibrium for the C·A mismatch. The C·A mismatch is always well repaired, independently of the pH. Base protonation does not inhibit mismatch repair. The structures that we observe for the neutral and protonated species are similar. There is no change in terms of donors and acceptors in the major and minor groove that influence MutS binding. This is not the case for the A·G mispair, although the contribution of the protonated structure at physiological pH is lower. To be efficient, the mismatch repair system has to be able to recognize the different conformations of the same error.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation The oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence 29-39 of the K-ras gene wild-type or mutated were synthesised by a classical phosphotriester method (van der Marel et al., 1981; Marugg et al., 1984). The pairs of oligonucleotides were heated to 80°C followed by slow cooling to form the C·G, C·A or A·G duplexes. The sequences are:

AMBER data bases without change, over 100 picoseconds and were performed with very weak restraints on all torsion angles d (d0 = 144°) to reinforce the C2'-endo conformation except those of the sugars of the C·A+ base-pair, for which the NMR data indicate that the conformation may not be predominantly C2'-endo. For these residues, no constraint was applied. For the others, the force constant used was 6 kcal/(mol rad2 ). All molecular dynamics computations were performed with weak reinforcements of the hydrogen bonds of terminal ° base-pairs with a force constant of 5 kcal/(mol A2 ) to prevent end fraying. No angle constraint was applied on hydrogen bonds. NMR distance measurements were used as restraints in molecular dynamics with a force constant ° of 5 kcal/(mol A2 ). These computations, referred to as MDI, include all NMR distance restraints except in the case of the base-pair C·A+, where distances involving C6 or A17 were not included because these residues are involved in a conformational equilibrium. Control computations without NMR restraints are referred to as MDII. Conformational snapshots obtained every 0.1 picosecond were used to compute averages and to prepare trajectory plots.
