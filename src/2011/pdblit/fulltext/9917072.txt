ABSTRACT The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 is known to bind specifically to an RNA hairpin formed within the MS2 genome. Structurally this hairpin is built up by an RNA double helix interrupted by one unpaired nucleotide and closed by a four-nucleotide loop. We have performed crystallographic studies of complexes between MS2 coat protein capsids and four RNA hairpin variants in order to evaluate the minimal requirements for tight binding to the coat protein and to obtain more information about the three-dimensional structure of these hairpins. An RNA fragment including the four loop nucleotides and a two-base-pair stem but without the unpaired nucleotide is sufficient for binding to the coat protein shell under the conditions used in this study. In contrast, an RNA fragment containing a stem with the unpaired nucleotide but missing the loop nucleotides does not bind to the protein shell. Keywords: bacteriophage MS2; crystal structure; RNA binding; RNA­protein interactions

INTRODUCTION The Escherichia coli phage MS2 belongs to the leviviridae family and contains a positive, single-stranded, 3,569-nt-long RNA molecule+ The genome encodes four proteins: the A (or maturation) protein, the coat protein, the lysis protein, and a replicase subunit (Fiers, 1979)+ The T 3 icosahedral shell protecting the RNA molecule is built up from 180 copies of the coat protein subunit+ The subunits exists as three different conformers denoted A, B, and C, which form two structurally different dimers, A/B and C/C in the capsid (Valegård et al+, 1990; Golmohammadi et al+, 1993)+ The major

conformational difference between the conformers lies in the FG-loop connecting the b-strands F and G (Fig+ 1A)+ At the 59 end of the replicase gene, the RNA genome can form a hairpin, which has a dual function in vivo+ Binding of a dimer of viral coat protein to this site represses the translation of the replicase, because the hairpin includes the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and the start codon of the replicase gene (Fig+ 1B)+ The RNA­coat protein complex also functions as a nucleation point for assembly and hence encapsidation of the correct RNA molecule+ The RNA hairpin comprises a 7-bp, double-helical stem closed by a 4-nt loop and interrupted by one unpaired residue on the 59 leg of the stem, between bp 5 and 6+ To achieve tight binding of the hairpin to the coat protein, the base at position 4 (see Fig+ 1B for numbering) must be an adenine, 5 a pyrimidine, and 7 and 10 purines (Witherell et al+, 1991)+ We have used X-ray crystallography to study RNA­ protein complexes between four differently modified RNA operator hairpins and MS2 coat protein+ Crystals were grown of capsids formed by recombinant MS2 131

132 coat protein overexpressed in E. coli+ RNA molecules were synthesized chemically and soaked into the MS2 crystals+ Previously, we have published the X-ray structures of MS2 coat protein­RNA complexes for the wildtype RNA operator hairpin and for the C-5 variant operator where the wild-type uracil at position 5 is replaced by a cytosine (Valegård et al+, 1994; Valegård et al+, 1997)+ This single-nucleotide substitution results in an RNA hairpin binding to the MS2 coat protein several times stronger than the wild-type (Lowary & Uhlenbeck, 1987; Stockley et al+, 1995; Lago et al+, 1998)+ Recently, the X-ray structures of two complexes between coat proteins with single amino acid substitutions and wild-type hairpin have been published (van den Worm et al+, 1998)+ Although the hairpins in all these cases have been 19 nt in length, the 59 and 39 ends of the RNA have been disordered, allowing at most 16 nt, from 13 to 3, to be modeled in the electron density+ The crystal structure of an aptamer­ coat protein complex, however, shows clear electron density for all 14 nt (Convery et al+, 1998)+ There are two structurally interesting parts of the operator hairpin, the loop region and the unpaired nucleotide (Fig+ 1B)+ These are also the key recognition targets for the coat protein+ The residue A-4 in the loop region binds to a pocket in the A subunit in the A/B dimer, whereas the unpaired residue A-10 binds to the equivalent pocket in the B subunit+ At the C/C dimer, the RNA hairpin can bind in both orientations+ We have dissected the wild-type RNA hairpin into two asymmetric "half-sites" (Lago et al+, 1998)+ One short RNA hairpin (called "Loop") encompassing the four loop nucleotides and a two-base-pair stem, but missing the unpaired nucleotide was synthesized according to the sequence in Figure 1B+ Two RNA fragments ("A-bulge" and "F-bulge") encompassing the unpaired nucleotide but lacking the four loop nucleotides were also synthesized+ The difference between the A-bulge and the F-bulge lies in the linkers that keep the two strands together covalently (Fig+ 1B)+ These three RNA molecules were made to determine if either of the two half-sites, the unpaired nucleotide or the loop, alone is sufficient for the presentation of an essential recognition surface needed for strong binding to the coat protein+ A fourth RNA hairpin ("Clamp") was synthesized with two additional base pairs compared to the longest one used in earlier studies (Fig+ 1B)+ Earlier studies have shown that the last 1 or 2 bp give a weaker electron density than the rest of the hairpin, suggesting increased flexibility at the bottom of the stem (Valegård et al+, 1994, 1997; van den Worm et al+, 1998)+ The structure of a longer RNA fragment, where two extra base pairs function as a clamp, allows us to distinguish between two types of flexibility: rigid body motion of the stem, which would lead to similar density irrespective of stem length, or breathing of the base pairs at the end

of the stem, which would allow us to see more base pairs in the longer fragment+ RESULTS Quality of the models Electron density maps were calculated to 2+6, 2+9, 2+75, and 2+6 Å resolution for the Clamp, Loop, A-bulge and F-bulge complexes, respectively+ All maps are of high quality because of the phase refinement possible because of the tenfold noncrystallographic symmetry+ Only the maps of the Clamp and the Loop complexes showed interpretable density for the RNA, and it was possible to build RNA models for these two complexes as evidenced by Figure 2+ At the asymmetric A/B dimer, the RNA hairpin binds in a unique orientation relative to the protein+ This gives clear electron density for the RNA+ At the symmetric C/C dimer, however, the RNA hairpin can bind in two ways to the protein, giving two overlapping electron densities for the RNA, making the interpretation more difficult+ Both the Clamp and the Loop complex models include the three coat protein conformers (A, B, and C), RNA bound to the A/B as well as the C/C dimers, and approximately 160 water molecules+ The model of the Loop RNA complex includes all 8 nt, whereas the model of the Clamp RNA hairpin complex includes all but the last 2 bp, that is, 19 of the 23 nt+ The same numbers of nucleotides are included for the A/B and the C/C binding RNA molecules in both models+ The quality of our protein models has been tested using the program Procheck (Laskowski et al+, 1993)+ The Ramachandran plots show no residues in disallowed regions+ The RNA models were checked by calculating the torsion angles for all residues and comparing the results with the corresponding values for tRNAPhe (Holbrook et al+, 1978)+ All residues have torsion angles close to the ones observed in the tRNA+ The crystallographic R factors of the final models of Clamp and Loop were 0+207 and 0+182, respectively+

Loop The Loop RNA molecule contains the 4 nt in the C-5 variant loop and a 2-bp stem, with the sequence according to Figure 1B+ Well-defined electron density was observed in the wild-type binding site on the coat protein, that is the A subunit+ No RNA density was seen on the B subunit+ In the 4-nt loop region, the electron density is strong and continuous, but it is weaker for the 2-bp stem+ The RNA model (Fig+ 2A) is very similar to the corresponding part of the C-5 variant structure (Valegård et al+, 1994, 1997)+ The uridine at 6, however, is modeled differently here+ In all complexes studied so far, this base has a very weak density most likely because of dis-

order+ Previously, this uracil has been modeled in the electron density with the glycosyl bond between sugar and base in the anti conformation+ In the Loop electron density, however, this base was observed in the syn conformation+ The x-angle (O49­C19­N1­C2 for pyrimidines) describing the glycosyl bond is 158 for nucleotide 6 in the Loop RNA model and 2598 for the same nucleotide in the Clamp RNA model+ The twofold symmetry at the C/C dimer gives two possibilities for interaction with the RNA hairpin+ When longer RNA molecules are used, the resulting electron density shows the two orientations overlapped+ Since the Loop RNA is only eight residues long, two molecules can bind to each C/C dimer without causing any overlap in the electron density+ The shortest distance between two RNA molecules bound to one C/C dimer is 5+4 Å and the electron density for each of these two RNA regions is of the same strength as for the RNA bound to the A/B dimer+ This indicates that two Loop RNA molecules can bind simultaneously to one C/C dimer+ At the A/B dimer, the Loop RNA binds in only one orientation relative to the protein in the same way as for all other RNA molecules soaked into the MS2 capsids so far+ We have previously suggested that the unique orientation of the RNA hairpin binding to the A/B dimer is because of a contact between O2P of U-6 and the side chain of Ala B80 that is too close in the alternative twofold related orientation (Valegård et al+, 1997)+ If the RNA molecule is rotated using an operator optimally relating the A and B subunits (the quasi twofold rotation), this distance would be 1+9 Å, whereas the observed distance between this oxygen and Cb of Ala A80 is 11+2 Å (Fig+ 3)+ The observed unique binding of the short Loop RNA to the A/B dimer indicates that it is perhaps one of the eight residues in this hairpin that is responsible for the exclusion of the other possible binding orientation, which is consistent with our hypothesis+ Bulge The Bulge RNA molecules were constructed with the aim of forming a stem containing the unpaired adenosine, but without the 4-nt loop+ Initially, crystals were soaked with two RNA fragments corresponding to the two strands of the stem, but with no covalent link+ No electron density was observed at the expected RNAbinding position (unpubl+ results)+ Since there was a possibility that the two segments would not form a duplex to a sufficient extent for binding, two different covalent connections between the two strands (Fig+ 1B) were tested, thereby increasing the probability of forming double-stranded stems inside the coat protein particle+ The possibility that only single-stranded RNA can enter the particles made it necessary to use connections that are flexible enough to permit both opening and reclosing of the double-stranded parts of these

133 molecules+ In the A-bulge case, the connection was a triethylene glycol group+ The F-bulge connection was made of two tetrahydrofuran derivatives+ No continuous electron density was observed for either the A-bulge or the F-bulge complexes at the wildtype binding site at the coat protein+ This was not due to poor quality of the electron density, because the density of the coat protein was the same as observed in other cases+ Unconnected electron density was observed that could be due to RNA, but the distribution of this electron density was not significantly different from what has been observed for "empty" MS2 capsids (unpubl+ results), where it appears that cellular RNA fragments have bound unspecifically and differently to the dimers of the capsid, resulting in weak noncontinuous electron density+ The lack of continuous electron density indicates that the F-bulge and A-bulge RNA molecules do not form strong interactions with the protein capsid and maybe they do not bind at all+ Clamp The Clamp RNA hairpin consists of 23 nt with a sequence shown in Figure 1B+ The molecule is identical to the C-5 variant RNA used in earlier studies (Valegård et al+, 1994, 1997), but with two additional GC base pairs at the bottom of the stem+ Interpretable electron density was observed for 19 of the 23 nt in the Clamp RNA-MS2 coat protein complex+ No electron density at all was observed for the two extra base pairs added at the bottom of the stem+ An overview of the complex between the Clamp RNA and the A/B dimer of MS2 coat protein is shown in Figure 4+ The conformation of the MS2 coat protein in the capsid is very similar to the conformations in the wild-type and C-5 complexes with one exception; the sidechain of Lys 61 in the A conformer has a different orientation compared to the earlier models+ This new orientation gives possibilities for new contacts with the 5 nt in the RNA molecule (Fig+ 5)+ In Lys 61, the distance from atom Nz to O2 is 3+1 Å, to O29 is 2+6 Å, and to O39 is 3+2 Å in cytidine 5+ In the C-5 variant model, this lysine is stacked against the base of A-4, but the amino group does not form any direct contacts with the RNA+ In all complexes, the lysine in the B conformer has a single conformation stacked on the base of A-10, forming salt links to the phosphate oxygens of nucleotides 10 and 11+ In the C-5 variant and most other complexes studied, the conformation of the lysine is similar in the A, B, and C conformers, in contrast to the Clamp complex+ In the wild-type RNA complex, however, the electron density for Lys A61 is weak and there is evidence for both conformations for the lysine, although only one conformation was modeled+ Lysine residues are often flexible, but we have not been able to find any explanation for the specific conformational variability of this particular residue+

The Loop RNA consists of only eight residues, but can still form a stable complex with the MS2 coat protein in the form of an RNA-free capsid+ This shows that the interactions formed between the protein and the nucleotides in the Loop molecule (i+e+, the loop region and the upper part of the stem) are sufficient for binding and that the unpaired nucleotide at position 10 is not needed for complex formation+ This is in contrast to the results of both Wu & Uhlenbeck (1987), who showed that an RNA hairpin where A-10 is base paired does not bind to the coat protein dimer in solution, and Talbot et al+ (1990), who achieved the same results for an RNA hairpin with a deletion at position 10+ These studies were based on nitrocellulose filter binding assays (Carey & Uhlenbeck, 1983), probably reflecting an increased off-rate for these hairpin variants, leading to apparent nonbinding in an assay involving separation of equilibrium mixtures+ Equilibrium filtration experiments (Lago et al+, 1998) indicate that the Loop RNA binds with an affinity of about one eighteenth of that of the C-5 variant hairpin+ The lower affinity can probably be explained by the missing contacts, which would be contributed by A-10 in the C-5 variant hairpin+ The loop nucleotides alone seem to be sufficient for the hairpin to adopt the three-dimensional structure needed for protein recognition and binding+ Upon binding to the protein, this region becomes the best defined of the hairpin (i+e+, the lowest temperature factors and the clearest electron density)+ The observed nonbindings of the Bulge RNA molecules indicate that these molecules either lack the ability to obtain the correct conformation for binding or form interactions with the protein that are too weak+ Equilibrium filtration experiments, on the other hand, show that the affinity for the A-bulge hairpin variant is about the same as for the Loop hairpin (Lago et al+, 1998)+ The solution structure of a hairpin similar to the C-5 variant has been studied by NMR (Borer et al+, 1995)+ According to this study, the loop region is not well defined, suggesting a relatively high degree of flexibility+ The unpaired A-10 is mainly stacked between the adjacent bases of the helical stem, and the bulged out conformation is not detectable+ As indicated by this NMR study, it is possible that the probability for the unpaired nucleotide at 10 to bulge out of the RNA double helix is low for the molecule in solution+ When the RNA molecule is bound and oriented by the interaction in the loop region, this probability increases because of the correct positioning of the bulged residue and its pocket+ The expected protein­RNA interactions of the Bulge and the Loop complexes can be deduced from the interactions in the wild-type or C-5 variant complexes (Valegård et al+, 1997)+ Two of the bases in the loop region, 4 and 5, form specific contacts with the protein+ The protein residues in the A-subunit involved in the formation of the A-4 binding pocket are the same as

Murray et al+ (1994)+ The MS2 coat protein was overexpressed in E. coli and the self-assembled, RNA-free protein capsids formed were purified according to Valegård et al+ (1986) and Mastico et al+ (1993)+ Crystals in the spacegroup R32, with cell dimensions a b 288+0 Å and c 653+0 Å, were grown from the MS2 coat protein capsids using the hanging drop technique under conditions described earlier (Valegård et al+, 1986)+ RNA fragments were added to the empty capsid crystals to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL (Valegård et al+, 1994; van den Worm et al+, 1998)+ Diffraction data for the Loop complex were collected at station 9+6 at the CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, United Kingdom+ The wavelength was 0+87 Å and the temperature 5 8C+ Data sets for the A-bulge, the F-bulge, and the Clamp complexes were collected at station ID2 at ESRF, Grenoble, France+ The wavelength was 1+00 Å and the temperature 10 8C+ In all cases, the oscillation angle was 0+58 and a MAR Research image plate detector was used+ The data sets for A-bulge, F-bulge, and Clamp complexes were processed and scaled using the HKL package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996)+ Loop data was processed with Denzo (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996) and scaled using the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994)+ Table 1 presents statistics from the scaling of the data for the four complexes+ Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the model of the empty capsid of MS2 coat protein+ The phases were refined by cyclic averaging using the noncrystallographic symmetry and the program RAVE (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994)+ Models of Loop RNA and Clamp RNA complexes were built using the program O (Jones et al+, 1991)+ The program X-PLOR (Brünger, 1990) was used for positional refinement using the conjugate gradient-type minimization and for refinement of restrained temperature factors of the two models+ The values of occupancies for the RNA molecules were chosen to give temperature factors of the RNA atoms participating in hydrogen bonds to the protein in the same range as in earlier studies+ For the Loop model, the occupancies for both A/B and C/C binding RNA molecules were therefore set to 0+6 and for the Clamp model these values were set to 0+5+ Statistics from the refinement are shown in Table 2+ The final crystallographic R factors for the two models were 0+182 for the Loop and 0+207 for the Clamp+ Free R factors would be similar to the crystallographic R factors because of the tenfold noncrystallographic symmetry and were not used to
