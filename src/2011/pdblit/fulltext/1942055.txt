Abstract-A high affinity (K, = 2-3 x IO'O `) murine monoclonal anti-fluorescein IgM antibody M (18-2-3) exhibiting low temp. insolubility in the absence of bound ligand has served as a model to study cryoprecipitation. Insolubility of 18-2-3 at low temp. (4 C) had been shown to be reversible at higher temp. and in the presence of fluorescyl ligand. indicating antigen binding site invo1v~m~nt. The primary objectives were to isolate and identify structural comp~)nent(s~ responsible for insolubility at low temp. Procedures developed for production and isolation of the monomeric subunit (IgM,) involved thiol reduction and gel filtration separation in the presence of the Ewitterionic detergent, CHAPS. Fab and (Fc), fragments generated by papain digestion were purified sequentially by gel filtration (Sephadex G-200) and affinity chromatography (fluorescein-Sep~arose), A protocol for covalent labeling of Fab fragments with the fluorescent chromophore 2,s DNS-Cl was developed in order to measure steady-state fluorescence polarization. In kinetic and ~q~lilibr~nrn cryoprecipitation assays, noniigand~d 18-2-3 IgM and IgM, demonstrated insolubility. Bound Auorescyl ligand, increased ionic strength (0.5 M NaCl) or basic pH (> 8.0) abrogated cryoprecipitation. Isolated Fab or (Fc), fragments did not exhibit low temp. insofubiiity. Decreased cryoprecipitat~on occurred when (Fc), fragments were added to nonliganded 18-2-3 IgM. Fluorescence polarization of 2,5 DNS Fab 18-Z-3 fragments indicated lack of Fab-Fab aggregation. Results suggested that electrostatic interactions involving 18-2-3 antibody combining sites with interactive sites in the Fc region of homologous IgM were responsible for the phenomenon of cryoprecipitation.

INTRODUCTION

~ryoprotej~s include ~mmunoglobuiins which reversibly precipitate at temps below 37°C and are often associated with various pathological disorders, including Raynaud's syndrome, muttiple myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid factors
(RF) and WaldenstrGm's macroglobulinemia (Brouet et al., 1974). Depending on relative concn and in-

solubility properties, cryoimmunoglobulins can contribute to increased blood viscosity through intravascular aggregation and/or precipitation (Middaugh e# al., 1977). Cryoglobulins have been observed in normal BALBjc mice, with increased levels in autoimmune prone murine strains corretated with age and disease severity (Andrews ef ai., 1978). Although the molecular basis for insolubility of cryoglobulins at low temp. has only been proposed, collective evidence suggests no one general mechAbbreviations: AL, affinity labeled; BSA. bovine serum albumin: CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonioj- I-propanesulfonate; 2.5 DNS-Cl, &dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-suIfonyI-chloride; DTE, dithioerythritol; DTT, dithiothreitol; EDTA. ethyienediaminetetraac~tic acid. tetrasodium salt; FIX, fluorescein disodium salt: FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Fl, fluorescein: Fl-Sepharose, fluorescein-Sepharose 4B; H, heavy chain; IgM,, monomeric subunit of IgM; IOA, iodoacetamide; KPO,. potassium phosphate buffer; L, light chain: SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel ele~trophoresis; SPRIA, solid phase radioimmuno~ss~y; TEBT, IO mM Tris-HCI, 150 mM NaCl, I mM EDTA, 1% BSA, 0.0~5% Tween-20, pH 8.0.

anism is involved. For example, one study indicated that protein aggregation resulted from electrostatic interactions between cryoimmunoglobulin molecules (~iddaugh ef aI., 1978). Recent work attributed low temp ~nsoIub~~ity of a human IgG monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulin to abnormal glycosylation in the first hypervariable region of the heavy chain (Middaugh and Litman, 1987). Additional hypotheses proposed to explain cryoprecipitation have included: (I) an antigen-antibody reaction between two immunoglobulins (homologous or heterologous) involving carbohydrate residues, such as sialic acid or ~-acetyl-lactosam~ne (Weber and CIem, 1981; Weber et al.. 19X4; Fatel and Brown, 1985). The sugar moieties involved are usually Fc adducts; (2) temperature induced conformational changes within the Fab region (Middaugh et al., 1978): (3) temperature sensitive changes in the immunoglobulin molecule correlated with the liganded and nonliganded states (Ballard et al., 1983; Okada Cl nf.. 1985). A high affinity (2-3 x IO'" M-l) murine monoclonal anti-fluorescein IgM anti body (I 8-2-3) displaying temp. dependent jnsolubility in the absence of bound ligand has served as a mode1 to study mechanisms of cryoprecipitation (Ballard ef al., 1983). An IgM cryoprotein was considered a suitable model since rheumatoid factors (RF) are frequently cryoglobulins of the IgM isotype (Kater and Schuurman, 19X1). The 18-2-3 hybridoma anti body was generated from cell fusion of splenocytes derived from an (NZB x NZW) F, mouse, a strain showing a high

incidence of autoimmunity, following secondary immunization with Auorescein conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Uniquely, temp. dependent insolubility of antibody 18-2-3 at low temp. (4°C) was abrogated by presence of bound fluorescyl ligand, implying direct involvement of the antigen binding site in self-aggregation. Studies were conducted to correlate effect of temp. on pentamer (IgM), monomer (IgM,), Fab fragments and (Fc), fragments. The experimental focus was to isolate and characterize the minimum structural component(s) exhibiting atypical low temp. insolubility. Procedures were developed for the isolation of pure IgM, monomers and Fab fragments in the native state. Isolated IgM, monomers and Fab fragments were shown to have nondenatured antigen binding sites when assayed and compared to the intact IgM pentamer in solid phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) and fluorescent ligand binding assays. Kinetic and equilibrium cryoprecipitation assays were performed to evaluate the ability of pentamer and monomer, as well as Fab and (Fc), fragments, to self-aggregate at low temp. Conditions examined included ionic strength, pH and excess fluorescein, as well as affinity labeled IgM 18-2-3. Fab fragments were labeled with the fluorescent probe 2, 5 DNS-Cl in order to determine if Fab-Fab interactions were involved in cryoprecipitation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

at 37-C (Walton and Scott, 1964). Enriched gamma globulin was obtained by precipitation with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and dissolved in phosphate buffer (50 mM KPO,, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0). Anti-fluorescyl antibodies present in the gamma globulin fraction were reacted with fluorescein-Sepharose 4B (Fl-Sepharose) (Sundberg and Porath, 1974). incubated sequentially at 37` C (3 hr) and 4`C (48 hr), washed and eluted with 0.1 M fluorescein disodium salt (FDS) at pH 8.0 in phosphate buffer. Free fluorescein was removed by anion exchange chromatography (Dowex 1-X8) (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) in phosphate buffer. Liganded affinity purified antibodies were characterized by absorbance at = the 278nm (t y&0,* 1.35) and 505 nm to quantitate amount of Ig protein and bound fluorescyl ligand, respectively. Nonliganded affinity purified 18-2-3 antibody (I ml fractions) was obtained by low pH elution (0.23 M glycine-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2.6) into tubes containing 0.5 M KPO,, 0.5 M NaCI, pH 8.0 (I ml). pH neutralization prevented IgM 18-2-3 precipitation at room temp. Purified antibody solutions subsequently dialyzed into phosphate buffer (50 mM KPO,. 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0) were stored at 4°C. Solid phase radioimmunoussuys Culture supernatants and purified antibodies were assayed for fluorescein binding by SPIRA. Fluorescein conjugated to bovine serum albumin (Fl,,-BSA, IO pg/ml) was adsorbed to polystyrene Immulon II wells (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Alexandria, VA) and washed three times with TEBT buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaC1, I mM EDTA, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 8.0). The third wash (30 min, 37'C) served to mask the wells. Culture supernatants or purified antibodies were added and allowed to react, followed by triphcate washes with TEBT. "`I-goat anti-mouse 1~ chain (Cappel, CooperBiomedical. Malvern, PA; - 5 x lo4 cpm) antibodies were added and allowed to incubate. Following three successive washes with TEBT, radioactivity was quantified in a Searle Model 1190 gamma counter (TM Analytic, Elk Grove Village, IL). Incubations were performed for 2 hr at 37'C or for 8 hr or longer at 4 C, except where indicated. Rudioiodinution

Cell line Hybridoma cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, supplemented with Eagle's nonessential amino acids, 4 mM glutamine, 5% heat inactivated calf serum, 10% heat inactivated horse serum (all from GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) and SOpgg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Whittaker M. A. Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD). Subcloning of hybridoma 18-2-3 by limiting dilution was performed to minimize escape from secretion. The IgM monoclonal antibody 18-2-3 was purified from ascites fluid following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of hybridoma cells into BALB/c mice primed with 2, 6, 10, 14 tetramethylpentadecane (pristane). Hybridoma 18-2-3 is composed of p heavy (H) and K light (L) chains with mol. wts of 70, 100 and 28,900, as determined by sodium dodecyl respectively, sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). The intrinsic affinity for the homologous hgand, derived from the dissociation lifetime (t = 5783 set) for 18-2-3 at 2 C, was 2.9 x IO'" Mm'. Antibody bound fluorescein displayed a bathochromic shift to 505nm from 493 nm (unbound) with >95% of the ligand's fluorescence quenched upon binding (Ballard et al., 1983).

Goat anti-mouse IgM (p chain specific) was radiolabeled with "`1 (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL) by a solid phase Iodogen method (Salacinski et al., 1981). Two hundred microliters of Iodogen (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL; 1 mg/ml in chloroform) was placed in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. To an Iodogen-coated tube were added sequentially 10 ~1 of 1.O M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 8 ~1 Na ""I (0.8 mCi) and lOpI protein (IOpg). After IOmin incubation at room temp.. contents of the vial were

diluted with 500 ~1 phosphate buffer (50 mM KPO,, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0), passed through a Dowex l-X8 anion exchange column (coated with BSA) to remove unincorporated `25I followed by washing with phosphate buffer (2-506 ~1). Monoclonal antibody 18-2-3 was radiolabeled (`251)to a high specific activity (2.1 x lo9 cpm/mg) by the solid phase Iodogen method with the following modifications. To an Iodogen-coated tube were added sequentially 10 ~1 of 1.O M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 10 ~1 Na "`1 (1.0 mCi) and 17.86 ~1 protein (1OOpg). After 10min incubation at room temp., contents of the vial were diluted as above, passed over a Dowex l-X8 column and stored at 4°C. Monoclonal antibody 5-27 was also iodinated by the Iodogen method.
Preparation of reductive fragments

papain was performed in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCI, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 digestion buffer (Oi and Herzenberg, 1979). Mercuripapain (Cooper Biomedical, Malvern, PA) was activated (15 min, 37°C) in digestion buffer containing 1 mM dithioerythritol (DTE) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and added to the IgM solution (2-5 mg/ml) at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1: 100 (w/w). Following incubation (16-20 hr, 22"C), digestion was terminated by addition of 1 mM dehydroascorbic acid (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) and the samples dialyzed into 50 M KPO,, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0. Nonliganded 18-2-3 Fab fragments and (Fc), fragments were isolated by sequential chromatography on Sephadex G-200 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ) and on Fl-Sepharose. ABPC 22 Fab and (Fc), fragments were resolved by Sephadex G200 gel filtration.
Cryoprecipitation kinetics assays

Murine monoclonal 18-2-3 and a human IgM myeloma (Mercy Hospital, Urbana, IL) were reduced in 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0, in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl or 10mM CHAPS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Purification of human IgM was achieved from human serum by dextran sulfate-ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by gel filtration (Sepharose 4B, 0.1 M KPO,, pH 8.0). The macroglobulin peak was isolated and shown to be pure by immunoelectrophoresis using rabbit anti-human antiserum. Prior to reduction, samples were precipitated with ammonium sulfate and resuspended to a concn of 3 mg/ml. Four milliliters of affinity purified 18-2-3 or human IgM were reduced (1 hr, ambient temp.) in buffer with 100~1 dithiothreitol (DTT) (100: 1 M ratio, DTT: protein) and alkylated (1 hr) with iodoacetamide (IOA) (two-fold molar excess over DTT concn). The mixture was added to a Sephadex G-200 column (1.6 x 100 cm) and eluted with the buffer used for reduction. Antibody fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine purity and size of reductive subunits. Electrophoresis was performed in 7.5% or 12% gels according to the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (1970) as described by Watt and Voss (1978). To ascertain purity, samples in 2% SDS were reduced with 0.1 M DTT (lOO'C, 10 min) and alkylated with 0.2 M IOA (24"C, 10 min). Protein samples were analyzed under nonreducing conditions to determine size of reductive fragments. A simple aliquot containing 10 mM CHAPS was dialyzed into 50 mM KPO,, 0.5 M NaCI, pH 8.0 and fluorescein binding activity assayed by SPRIA. Another aliquot of the sample containing 10mM CHAPS was dialyzed into 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0 and cryoprecipitability determined. Samples containing 10mM CHAPS were tested for fluorescein binding (SPRIA) and cryoprecipitation.
Preparation of Fab and (Fc), fragments

Antibody solutions at different concns were dialyzed overnight (37°C) into phosphate buffer (50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0). Antibody solutions were also assayed in phosphate buffer (50 mM KPO,) at pH 7.0, 7.5 and 9.0 and in the presence of excess ligand ([Fl] > [active sites]). Cryoprecipitation was assayed turbidimetrically at 320 nm in a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer equipped with a water-jacketed cuvette compartment and Data Station. The cuvette chamber and antibody solutions were equilibrated at 37°C. After equilibration, the temp. setting was changed to 4'C and the five cuvettes examined simultaneously, with each cuvette scanned every 60 set for 125 min. Reversibility of 18-2-3 cryoprecipitation was demonstrated when the temp. setting was changed to 37°C and cuvettes were scanned until antibody solutions reached 37°C. Absorbance was recorded with respect to time. An approximate association rate constant for the second order reaction was determined using the initial antibody concn and t, 2 (time at which the precipitation curve showed one-half of maximum turbidity).
Cryoprecipitation equilibrium assays

Antibody solutions were prepared and assayed under the same solvent conditions described for the kinetic assays. Prior to testing, antibody solutions (20 pg/ml) were dialyzed into 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0 (37'C) and concn determined (37'C). In the liquid phase equilibrium radioimmunoassay, antibody solutions and "`I-18-2-3 (- lo5 cpm) were mixed at 37°C and incubated at 4°C (20 hr). Anti-F1 monoclonal antibody 5-27 and 12'1-5-27 were treated in a similar manner as negative controls. Following incubation, all solutions were centrifuged (4, C, lO,OOOg, 10 min) and radioactivity in precipitates and supernatants quantitated in a Searle Model 1190 gamma counter.

IgM, monomeric subunit IgM, and Fab fragments were determined at 2C as described (Herron, 1984). Affinity purified antibody (- 1 pM sites, 100 ~1) containing 1 PM fluorescein was added to a cuvette and equilibrated at 2°C in an Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer equipped with a Heath recorder and Forma Scientific controlled temp. bath. Antibody with bound fluorescein was reacted with excess (I pi4 in I .O ml) 5-aminofluorescein (quantum yield 0.003). Since free fluorescein has a high quantum yield (0.92) displacement of bound and quenched fluorescein by the amine analog (in ten-fold excess) resulted in an increase in fluorescence intensity (monitored at 535 nm). Ligand dissociation data were analyzed and plotted by first order kinetics: In FI/, - FU, FU, - FU, = -k,t

fragments in 8 M urea to a standard curve generated using dansyl-e-aminocaproic acid. Emission wavelength for monitoring was determined by scanning dansyl-t -aminocaproic acid in polar solvent (buffer) and nonpolar solvent (cyclohexane). Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were obtained using a photon counting spectrofluorometer (Gratton and Limkeman, 1983). Fluorescence measurements

where FU, is the initial fluorescence, FU, is the fluorescence observed at time (t) and FU, is the maximum fluorescence observed with total dissociation of bound fluorescein. k, is the unimolecular rate constant. Intrinsic affinities (K, = k,/k,) were determined using k, = 5 x 106M- ' see-' (2"C), a value previously determined for anti-fluorescyl antibodies (Kranz et al., 1982). Fluorometric analyses were used to compare methods of elution of 18-2-3 from Fl-Sepharose. In order to show that affinity purification by low pH elution did not perturb the active site of 18-2-3, the antibody was dialyzed against lo-`M FDS and the dissociation rate determined. AJinity labeling of IgM 18-2-3

Fluorescence polarization was measured using the fluorometer described above. Excitation was at 388 nm and emission was measured at 437 and 479 nm as temp. varied (37°C>4"C) by means of a low temp. refrigerated circulating water bath (Neslab). Fluorescence polarization (P) and anisotropy (A) were computed as described by Weber (1952). Fluorescence lifetime measurements were made using a multifrequency phase and modulation fluorometer (Gratton et al., 1984) and a laser light source (He-Cd) laser at 325 nm) at frequencies from 1 to 80MHz. Emission (440 and 470nm) was analyzed as multi-exponential decays using statistical methods, based on analysis of the chi-square.

RESULTS

Pur$cation

of 18-2-3

Purified nonliganded IgM 18-2-3 was affinity labeled (AL) by modification of the method by Watt and Voss (1978). Antibody solution (- 3 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 30 x molar excess of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-I) (- 1 x 10m4 M) in 0.2 M Tris-HCI, 0.5 M NaCI, pH 8.8 (6 hr, 4°C). The reaction was terminated by passage of the reaction mixture over Dowex I -X8, equilibrated in 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0. Normal mouse gamma globulin was reacted as a control under identical labeling conditions to determine the potential for FITC labeling external to the antibody combining site. Conjugation of 2,5 DNS-Cl to Fab 18-2-3 fragments

Fab 18-2-3 fragments were fluorescently labeled by addition of 2-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride (2,5 DNS-Cl; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (Herron and Voss, 1981) dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) in ten-fold molar excess to a solution of Fab fragments in 50 mM KPO, (pH 8.0) 0.5 M NaCl. The reaction was stirred for 30 min at room temp. Labeling was terminated by addition of 10mM glycine and the sample dialyzed into phosphate buffer. Quantitation of labeling was achieved by comparing the fluorescence of dansylated Fab

Affinity purification of 18-2-3 from gamma globulin fractions involved binding to Fl-Sepharose and elution with fluorescein (0.1 M) or glycine-HC1 buffer (0.23 M. 0.5 A4 NaCl, pH 2.6) to yield liganded and nonliganded antibody, respectively. Sodium chloride (0.5 M) was added to the phosphate buffer since cryoprecipitation of IgM 18-2-3 was abrogated by increased ionic strength (Ballard et al., 1985). Native nonliganded 18-2-3 was obtained if the low pH eluate was neutralized immediately upon dissociation from Fl-Sepharose. Without neutralization, 18-2-3 precipitated irreversibly upon remaining at the low pH for 20min or longer. One criterion for purity of pentameric 18-2-3 was determined by calculating the r-value (representing moles of fluorescein bound per mole of antibody) for ligand eluted antibodies; an r-value of >9 was obtained. In the case of antibodies eluted at low pH, >90% of 18-2-3 was reactive with the adsorbent (Fl-Sepharose). Affinity purified 18-2-3 was estimated to be >95% pure based on both SDS-PAGE and antigen reactivity patterns. Affinity labeled 18-2-3 had an r-value of >9. The degree of FITC labeling of normal mouse gamma globulin under the same conditions was ~5%. This indicated that nearly all fluorescein in 18-2-3,, was located within the antigen binding site. Both affinity labeled and liganded 18-2-3 had the same spectral absorption shift (&,,, = 505 nm) and superimposable spectra.

Isolation of IgM, subunits Successful fragmentation of mouse IgM was not possible by employing procedures established for IgM molecules from other species. A method combining trypsinization and reduction reported by Matthew and Reichardt (1982) for mouse IgM did not result in 18-2-3 IgM, subunits and halfmers (one-half of IgM,, containing one complete H chain and one L chain covalently linked, described by Giles et al., 1983) as expected, but yielded primarily 18-2-3 halfmers, defined by SDS-PAGE. Optimal conditions for generating monomeric subunit (IgM,) by thiol reduction were determined using different protein concentrations, DTT:protein ratios, incubation times (l&60 min) and temp. (room temp. and 37 C). When comparing reduction of liganded and nonliganded 18-2-3 at various DTT: protein ratios (200: l-1000: l), it was observed that upon binding of fluorescein by 18-2-3, the antibody was more sensitive to thiol reduction. Possibly conformational changes or alteration in domain-domain interactions attributable to ligand binding may render certain disulfide bonds more accessible to reducing agent. Optimal conditions for thiol reduction of nonliganded 18-2-3 to yield the 7S monomeric subunit (IgM,) were DTT: protein = 100: 1 molar ratio (1 hr, ambient temp.). Investigating various molar ratios of DTT: protein revealed a delicate balance between underreduction and overreduction. The former resulted in a low yield of IgM, and the latter in the production of halfmers or dissociated H and L chains. A purified human IgM myeloma (noncryoglobulin) of unknown specificity was used as a comparative control in reduction and isolation procedures. The monoclonal human IgM was also useful as a calibration marker in gel filtration chromatography. Resolution of IgM, monomeric subunits from parental 18-2-3 IgM was dependent upon buffer composition used during thiol reduction and subsequent gel filtration. In the presence of 50 mM KPO,, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0, antibody 18-2-3 IgM, did not dissociate efficiently from the parent pentamer (Fig. 1) although the human IgM control showed complete dissociation. It was, therefore, decided to use a zwitterionic detergent (CHAPS, IO mM) in place of 0.5 M NaCl during reduction and gel filtration. CHAPS served two purposes: (1) it abrogated the cryoproperty, and (2) it promoted dissociation of intersubunit domain4omain interactions which are primarily hydrophobic (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980). Finally, CHAPS does not bind tightly to proteins so detergent removal is achieved through dialysis (Hjelmeland, 1980). Figure 1 shows the results of reduction, alkylation and gel filtration of subunits derived from 18-2-3 in the presence of 10 mM CHAPS. The results, when compared with those in the presence of 0.5 M NaCI, indicated more efficient reduction and polymer dissociation. Gel filtration data analyzed by

As analyzed by SDSPAGE (7.5%) under nonreducing conditions, IgM, and halfmers did not separate in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl (0). In the presence of 10mM CHAPS (0) fractions 94109 contained IgM,, fractions 116127 contained approximately equal amounts of IgM, and halfmers and fractions 136146 contained halfmers. Fraction size was 1ml.

SDS-PAGE (7.5%) under nonreducing conditions showed two major peaks containing monomers (first peak) and monomers plus halfmers (second peak), indicating H-H disulfide bonds were covalent for IgM, and H-L disulfide bonds were covalent for IgM, and halfmers. Halfmers alone were isolated from the descending side of the second peak. Isolation qf Fab and (Fc), fragments Papain digestion was used for successful cleavage of murine monoclonal IgM 18-2-3 to produce Fab fragments. Immediately prior to use, mercuripapain was activated by a brief incubation (15 min, 37°C) in 50mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, containing 2mM EDTA and 1 mM DTE. To determine the concn of DTE required for optimal papain digestion of murine IgM, varying concns of DTE were used for activation of papain (I mA4 and IO mM DTE) and for equilibration of the antibody (I mM and 10 mM DTE, no DTE) prior to digestion. The higher concn (IOmM) of DTE used for papain activation and prior incubation of antibody in the presence of DTE resulted in a low yield of Fab fragments, probably due to overdigestion. Removal of DTE used in activation of papain by passage of the enzyme over Sephadex G-25 prior to use resulted in incomplete digestion. Because the volume of activated papain added to the antibody represented -5% of the total volume, the resulting DTE concentration was -0.05 mM. Evidently this low level of DTE was required for efficient digestion. Various incubation times (< I-20 hr) were tested; papain digestion of mouse IgM for 16-20 hr at 22-C was determined to be optimal. In the event that reduction of heavy-light chain

Digestion was terminated by addition of 1 mM dehydroascorbic acid. IgM was present in peak I, (Fc), fragments were in peak II and Fab fragments were in peak III. Fraction size was 1 ml.

disulfide bonds due to DTE had occurred during digestion, resulting fragments were dialyzed into 50 mM KPO,, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0 to maximize reoxidation of the heavy-light chain bonds (Parham et al., 1982) before gel filtration (Sephadex G-200). Figure 2 shows the isolation of nonliganded 18-2-3 Fab and (Fc), fragments by gel filtration chromatography. Individual fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) and pooled. SDS-PAGE analyses indicated the presence of a minor (_ 5%) low mol. wt protein apparently corresponding to J chain in the Fab fractions. In order to isolate Fab fragments, the pooled sample was incubated with Fl-Sepharose and eluted by low pH buffer (0.23 M glycine, 0.5 M NaCI, pH 2.6). Eiuted Fab fragments were dialyzed into the phosphate/saline buffer and stored (4°C). Purified Fab fragments had a mol. wt of 56,000 as determined by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Under reducing conditions, the Fab sample showed one diffused band (28,000) by SDS-PAGE, indicating that the Fd fragment and the light chain were of similar size. Purified Fab fragments represented 24% of the starting material or 48% of the theoretical yield. Papain digestion yielded oligomeric (Fc), fragments as described for human IgM (Feinstein et al., 1983). Murine IgM myeloma ABPC 22 was digested as a control using the same papain procedure. ABPC 22 Fab and (Fc), fragments were separated by gel filtration (Sephadex G-200) and yielded an elution profile similar to that obtained with 18-2-3.

hered to DEAE and were not eluted by Polybuffer 96. Upon addition of 1 M NaCl the Fab fragments eluted. Generally Fab fragments possess more basic pl values than Fc fragments so that Fab fragments elute early in ion exchange chromatography (DEAEcellulose) (Goding, 1986). Proteins have been observed to adsorb to ion exchange columns on the "wrong side" of their isoelectric point. Localized clusters of like-charged groups can cause adsorption despite the protein having an overall average charge of the opposite sign (Scopes and Algar, 1979). Nonliganded 18-2-3 Fab fragments appeared to have areas of negative charges because of the observed adherence to DEAE Bio-Gel A. Ligand binding studies Since low pH elution had been used in purification of pentameric 18-2-3 and Fab fragments, it was important to determine if 18-2-3 antigen binding sites had remained unaltered. Comparison of ligand binding properties of 18-2-3 IgM, IgM, and Fab fragments indicated that similar characteristics existed (Table l), which correlated with original studies with 18-2-3 (Ballard et al., 1983).

Ligand binding curves indicated that the process of reduction, alkylation and exposure to 10 mM CHAPS had not perturbed the antigen binding properties of the antibody. Additional evidence for integrity of the native state of the 18-2-3 molecule following purification based upon low pH elution was the maintenance of Clq binding to 18-2-3 IgM and IgM, (Swanson et al., 1988).

Kinetic assays in which the temp. was lowered from 37. to 4"C showed a direct relationship between protein concn and the temp. at which aggregation was first observed. Figure 4A depicts changes in ) absorbance (A310nm for different concns (46-250 Pg/ml) of nonliganded 18-2-3 IgM in 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0, as the temp. decreased from 37, to 4C. At higher protein concns. t,,? (time at which the Aszcnrn reading was one-half of the difference between the initial and final values) occurred at higher temp. Upon changing the temp. from 4 to 37°C and continuing to scan antibody solutions, the absorbance (AiZOnm)decreased until it reached the reading present at the beginning of the assay, thus demonstrating reversibility of 18-2-3 cryoprecipitation. Based on the linear portion (directly following the lag phase) of the four curves measuring turbidity, it appeared that cryoprecipitation of IgM 18-2-3 represented a second order reaction since a linear relationship existed between the reciprocal of the reactant concn (l/[A])

and time (t) (data not shown). Similar assay conditions have been used by Pate1 and Brown (1985) to demonstrate that the rate of complex formation of cryoglobulins was dependent on the initial antibody concentration and involved at least a bimolecular interaction. An approximate association rate constant (k,) was calculated using (Tinoco et al., 1985): 1

This value approximated that for two proteins colliding, each possessing a binding set-I). The rate consite (k, < kco,, - lo'-IO"M-' stant was an approximation since both time and temperature were variables. An observed lag preceding the linear phase was due to the requirement for two IgM molecules to aggregate for detection (Latimer, 1982). Length of the lag was inversely related to the initial antibody concentration. Data were fit to the empirical equation (Scoville et al., 1980): ln(rJrl ) n=------ln(c, lc2) (3)

where t, and t, are the t,:, for initial concns c, and c2, respectively. The value n estimates the number of molecules required for nucleation. In the case of IgM 18-2-3, n was calculated to be 0.9, indicating the IgM because of its native polyvalency has the potential to be a naturally nucleated aggregate. This is in contrast to the polymerization of protein which consists of nucleation and growth processes (Oosawa and Asakura, 1975). Evidence of nucleation is given by a nonzero intercept when plotting maximum optical density versus total protein concentration. The resulting plot of 18-2-3 (46, 69 and 133 pg/ml, Fig. 4A) essentially intersects the origin, suggesting that 18-2-3 IgM since it is a pentamer does not require a nucleation event prior to growth. An n = 0.9 for IgM 18-2-3 is compatible with n = 5 found for cryoglobulin WEB since the latter is an IgG molecule (Scoville et al., 1980). A decrease in temp. can result in an increase in the number of available binding sites, as proposed by Brandau er a/. (1986) for mixed cryoglobulins. In the case of an IgM which selfaggregates this would occur intramolecularly during the observed lag phase. Similar with liganded 18-2-3 IgM assays (53-289 pgg/ml; I = 9.3) showed much smaller changes in A320nm.which correlated directly with the concentration of nonliganded antigen binding sites (data not shown), which implicated nonliganded antigen binding sites as being involved in aggregation of 18-2-3 at low temps. Additional assay conditions for nonliganded 18-2-3 IgM included 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0, in the presence of NaCl (0.5 M NaCl), excess fluorescein and CHAPS (10 mM). In the presence of 0.5 M NaCl ([18-2-3 IgM]. 57-360 pg/ml) or excess sites]) ([18-2-3 IgM], ligand ([Fl] > 2 x [active 125 pg/ml), lowering the temp. to 4°C did not result in an increase in A320nm. In the presence of 10 mM CHAPS, 18-2-3 IgM (57-360 pg/ml) showed some increase in A j20Dm,but not to the same degree as with 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0. To test the effect of pH, 18-2-3 IgM was dialyzed into 50 mM KPO,, pH 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 at 37'C and the supernatant was

assayed for cryoprecipitation. Since 94% of the protein at pH 7.0 and 91% at pH 7.5, precipitated at 37°C due to pl proximity (7. l), the cryoprecipitation kinetic assay was performed at pH 8.0 and 9.0 (Fig. 4B). A lesser degree of 18-2-3 aggregation occurred at pH 9.0 ([ 18-2-3 IgM], 202 pg/ml). With nonliganded 18-2-3 IgM, (59 and 130 pg/ml) in 50mM KPO,, pH 8.0, an increase in Ajlon,,, occurred, but it was less than that observed with 18-2-3 IgM. This was expected since IgM and IgM, differ in size and spectral detection is limited to l/l0 the length of the wavelength (Latimer, 1982). Since IgM has a diameter of - 300 8, (Dorrington and Tanford, 1970), an aggregation of two molecules could be detected, whereas IgM, (h 55 x 125 A) would require that a greater number of molecules be aggregated for detection. Nonliganded 18-2-3 Fab fragments (256 pg/ml) did not show an increase in A3*,,",,, (Fig. 4C). If the Fab portion of 18-2-3 IgM bound the Fc region of 18-2-3 IgM, free (Fc), fragments would compete with the intact pentamer and a lesser, selflimiting degree of aggregation would occur. Alternatively, if 18-2-3 aggregation occurred via Fa&Fab interactions, free (Fc)~ fragments would not inhibit pentamer-pentamer interactions. In the presence of 18-2-3 (Fc), fragments (10m6 M), 18-2-3 IgM (5 x 10m8 M) did not show an increase in AXZOnm, indicating that free (Fc), fragments inhibited the self-aggregation of 18-2-3 pentamers.
`251-18-2-3 cryoprecipitation equilibrium assays

Radioiodinated 18-2-3 was used as a tracer in equilibrium assays to measure the percentage of unlabeled proteins which cryoprecipitated at 4,-C. The basic premise of using "51-18-2-3 (concn represented 0.1% of total protein present) was to monitor cryoprecipitation of specifically interacting unlabeled proteins, as the labeled tracer became trapped and precipitated with the aggregated proteins. Maximum cryoprecipitation (83.0%) occurred at pH 8.0. Results of this reaction were used to normalize all data to 100% reactivity (Table 2). A reduced amount of

cryoprecipjtatc (61 .O%) formed at pH 9.0 (4°C). Percent precipitation values obtained in the presence of excess fIuorescein (2 x and 4 x [active sites]) were 27.0% and 21.6%, which corresponded to that observed with nonself-cryoprecipitating anti-fluorescyl antibody 5-27 (28.9%) in the presence of 1251-5-27. Unexpectedly, affinity labeled 18-2-3 (l&2-3,,) yielded 75.1% precipitation at 4"C, rather than an antjcipated lower value that would occur if condition of the site(s) within or near the antigen binding site that are involved in cryoprecipitation were identical when fluorescein was covalently and noncovalently bound. In the event that a small number of nonliganded sites were responsible for this high value, excess fluorescein (2 x) was added; a similar percentage of cryoprecipitation (72.8%) was observed, indicating that covalent linkage of fluorescein in or proximal to the antigen binding site of 18-2-3 differed somewhat from a reversibly liganded site. The monomeric subunit (IgM,) yielded 77.2% cryoprecipitation and (Fc), fragments, 28.9% at 4°C. When mixed, IgM and (Fc), fragments showed a reduced amount of precipitation (54.8%) which would occur if the (Fc), fragments were preventing self-aggregation of pentamers. Gelatin, a relatively neutral molecule and negative control, resulted in 27.9% precipitation, a value similar to that found with (Fc), fragments. It was concluded that 18-2-3 (Fc), fragments and intact pentamer (when completely liganded) did not exhibit cryoprecipitation. Fluorescence polarization studies Due to a labeling ratio of 0.2-0.4DNS per 18-2-3 Fab fragment double fluorophore labeling per molecule was unlikely (Dombrink-Kurtzman et af., 1987). Steady-state polarization of 2,5 DNS Fab 18-2-3 fragments was measured and converted to anisotropy as a function of temp. (37"->4C) at two different wavelengths, corresponding to exposure of the fluorescent probe in polar solvent (479 nm) and in a hydrophobic environment (437 nm). Two different buffers (pH 8.0) were used, representing conditions where 18-2-3 IgM had shown: (a) cryoinsolubility (50mM KPO,), and (b) abrogation of cryoprecipitation (50mM KPO,, 0.5 M NaCl). Nonlinear least squares analysis of multifrequency phase and modulation data for 2,5 DNS Fab 18-2-3 gave the best fit (chi-square < 1) using a triple exponential decay. Fluorescence lifetimes of 27.24, 9.31 and 1.46 nsec were obtained for emission at 440 nm. Fluorescence lifetimes of 29.83, 9.73 and 144nsec were obtained for emission at 470nm. Slopes obtained from Perrin plots (Fig. 5) and fluorescence lifetimes were used to calculate rotational correlation times (tJ in order to estimate mol. wt, since t, is 1 nsec for each 2400 Da of protein mol. wt, if the protein is approximately spherical (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980). The average rotational correlation time for 2,5 DNS Fab 18-2-3 fragments was the same under both soivent conditions (50 mM KPO, or

DISCUSSION

Cryoprecipitation of certain immunoglobulins is an important factor in immunopathological disorders that have so far defied explanation in molecular terms. Since cryopr~ipitation can be attributed to a single species of immunoglobulin (monoclonai cryoglobulin) or to two different interacting immunoglobulins (mixed cryoglobulin), it was important in these studies to purify monoclonal antibody 18-2-3 (IgM anti-fluorescein cryoglobulin) to homogeneity in both the liganded and nonliganded states. Prior studies with 18-2-3 had shown that bound fluorescyl ligand abrogated cryoprecipitation (Ballard et ai., 1983). The high intrinsic affinity (g) of 18-2-3 (> 10'" M-i) prevented procurement of nonliganded antibody by affinity chromatographic procedures using ligand elution. Of various alternate elution schemes tested, 0.23 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.6 proved most efficient, provided the eluate was immediately neutralized. Having assessed the purity (SDS-PAGE) and native state of the antigen binding sites (fluorescence quenching, kinetic studies) of the pen-

tamer 18-2-3, it was judged that purification procedures had resulted in a single homogeneous component suitable for cryoprecipitation studies. Experiments were designed to correlate temp. effects on the intact IgM molecule with those of the monomer (IgM,), Fab fragments and (Fc), fragments, in order to isolate and characterize the minimum structural component(s) possessing low temp. insolubility. Initial thiol reduction studies of 18-2-3 were performed in 50 mM KPO,, pH 8.0, supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl, which abrogated cryoprecipitation. Only a single symmetrical peak was obtained when reduction, alkylation and gel filtration were performed in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl. Analysis by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions showed the gel filtration peak contained unreduced IgM, reduced IgM, and halfmers (Fig. 1). More efficient reduction and subunit separation occurred when the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS was used in place of 0.5 M NaCl (Fig. I). This indicated that 18-2-3 possessed noncovalent intersubunit interactions of a hydrophobic nature. Thus, reduction and gel filtration in CHAPS (10 mM) of murine monoclonal IgM 18-2-3 yielded monomeric subunits (IgMJ Procedures exist for production of Fab fragments from IgG of different species (Mage, 1980) and for Fab and F(ab'), of different IgG subclasses from rats and mice (Lamoyi and Nisonoff, 1983; Oi and Herzenberg, 1979; Parham, 1983; Rousseaux et al., 1983). Methods for generating Fab fragments from human IgM (Miller and Metzger, 1966; Onoue et al., 1967; Plaut and Tomasi, 1970) have not proven successful when applied to murine IgM. Bidlack and Mabie (1986) described preparation of Fab fragments from a mouse monoclonal IgM by digestion with trypsin in the presence of cysteine as the reducing agent. They mentioned that papain digestion did not yield Fab fragments. As described here, Fab and (Fc), fragments were produced by papain cleavage of 18-2-3 and murine IgM plasmacytoma ABPC22. Both showed similar elution profiles by gel filtration (Sephadex G-200) (Fig. 2). Nonliganded 18-2-3 Fab fragments (peak III) were subsequently isolated by affinity chromatography (Fl-Sepharose). Thus, a reproducible procedure was developed using papain to produce Fab fragments from two murine monoclonal IgM antibodies. In fragmenting 18-2-3 it was imperative that integrity of the antigen binding site of the antibody be determined before proceeding with assays regarding cryoprecipitability. Ligand binding studies included determination of dissociation lifetime (r)), K, and absorption maximum (&,,, for bound fluorescein) (Table 1). All spectral values obtained for 18-2-3 IgM, IgMB and Fab fragments were essentially the same. It should be noted that these values correspond to the original measurements with 18-2-3 (Ballard et al., 1983) and indicated that low pH and thiol reduction had not perturbed the ligand binding

properties of 18-2-3. Additionally, binding of 18-2-3 IgM, IgM, and halfmer to Fl-BSA in a SPRIA yielded superimposable curves (Fig. 3). Since cryoprecipitation was inhibited by neutral salts (NaCl) and increased pH, it appeared that self-aggregation of 18-2-3 IgM and IgM,, but not 18-2-3 Fab fragments alone, at low temperatures was due to formation of one or more electrostatic interactions involving the antibody combining site of the IgM molecule with sites in the Fc region of the homologous IgM. A lower temp. could result in an increase in the number of available binding sites. Since variation in net charge of proteins between pH 5.5 and 9.0 is mainly due to histidine residues, it is tempting to consider that histidine(s) may be involved in the Fab-Fc interaction, causing cryoprecipitation of IgM 18-2-3. At low temp. (5 C) the pK, of the imidazole side chain of histidine is approximately one unit higher than at 4o"C (7.467 vs 6.685) (Izatt and Christensen, 1976). If histidinefs) were in the protonated form when aggregation occurs, then raising the pH above 8 should result in histidine becoming unprotonated, perhaps leading to decreased cryoprecipitation. Antibody 18-2-3 at pH 9 showed reduced cryoprecipitability, indicating that the cold temp. insolubility of 18-2-3 could be related to the ionization of histidine residue(s) in the Fab or Fc, with or without a conformational change occurring. Low temp. may be selecting for one conformation of many possible states in a dynamic equilibrium. If histidines are involved in cryoprecipitation of 18-Z-3, they are more likely to occur in the Fc region since an absorbance spectrum of liganded 18-2-3 (data not shown) indicated that histidine was not involved in fluorescein binding (Kranz et al., 1982) and primary structures of IgM constant regions show a preponderance of histidine residues, especially in C,4 (Kabdt et trl.. 1987). Additionally. V region sequences of 18-2-3 showed only one histidine in V, at a position where it was also present in other antibodies devoid of cryoglobulin properties (Dombrink-Kurtzman et trl., manuscript in preparation). Involvement of histidine residues in cryoprecipitation would be analogous, in a reverse way, to their role in low temp. inactivation of certain enzymes which dissociate into subunits upon exposure to cold (Bock and Friedcn. 1978). Alternatively, cryoprecipitation could bc abrogated by conformational changes induced in the Fab fragment upon binding fluorescein, such that the antigen binding site is no longer capable of binding to Fc or ligand could be sequestering in sites in the Fab which bind Fc. Temperature induced conformation~l changes could occur, resulting in exposure of prcviously buried amino acids to solvent. Thus. the specific charge distribution on 18-2-3 could cause self-aggregation, whereas screening of electrostatic interactions by addition of salt ions would inhibit polymerization. Abrogation of cryoprecipitation by CHAPS could result from detergent binding to non-

polar residues in 18-2-3 and sterically hindering ionic sites involved in aggregation. Because of its native oligomeric structure and potential for multiplicity of interactions, pentameric IgM molecules would be expected to form relatively more stable complexes than those composed of IgM,. This is consistent with the greater degree of cryoprecipitation observed with 18-2-3 IgM compared to IgM, Since liganded 18-2-3 does not cryoprecipitate, it seems to indicate that critical ionic areas reside in or adjacent to the antigen binding site in the Fab part of the molecule, suggesting that pentamer, monomer and Fab fragments of 18-2-3 should all be involved in cryoprecipitation in the nonliganded state. However, Fab and (Fc), fragments alone did not cryoprecipitate. (Fc), fragments when added to 18-2-3 IgM reduced the amount of cryoprecipitation, indicating that free (Fc), fragments prevented self-aggregation of pentamers. Interactions between 18-2-3 IgM and (Fc)~ fragments can be viewed as self-limiting and would not be expected to form complexes of the size possible with IgM alone. Covalent linkage of fluorescein within or proximal to the antibody combining site of IgM 18-2-3 appeared to differ from a noncovalently liganded site since affinity labeling did not abrogate 18-2-3 cryoprecipitation. IgM 18-2-3 did not bind various subclasses of murine IgG monoclonal antibodies (Ballard, unpublished data). Studies are in progress to determine if 18-2-3 is capable of binding to other murine IgM antibodies. Since spectral (light scattering) measurements are affected by size of interacting molecules, an additional means of monitoring possible FabFab interactions was undertaken. 2,s DNS Fab 18-2-3 fragments were prepared and fluorescence polarization measurements performed varying solvent and temp. Dansylated Fab fragments were examined under conditions where 18-2-3 IgM and IgM, had exhibited reduced solubility in the cold. Analysis of data using fluorescence lifetime of the probe determined by multifrequency phase and modulation fluorometry indicated the absence of FabFab aggregation. In conclusion, the goal of this study was to isolate and characterize the structural component(s) responsible for insolubility of 18-2-3 at low temp. Protocols were developed for affinity purification of 18-2-3 in the absence of fluorescein. 18-2-3 IgM, and Fab fragments were isolated while maintaining their native state, as indicated by fluorescent and solid phase binding assays. Cryoprecipitation occurred with 18-2-3 IgM or IgM, alone, but not with 18-2-3 Fab or (Fc), fragments separately. Since increased pH or ionic strength abrogated the cryoproperty, electrostatic interactions were implicated as being responsible for 18-2-3 low temp. insolubility. It is postulated that histidine residue(s) may be involved in the mechanism of 18-2-3 cryoprecipitation, whereby the antigen binding site, in the absence of fluorescein, is capable of binding to the Fc region of the antibody.
