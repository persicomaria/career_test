Abstract--Based on the X-ray crystallography of our lead compound 1-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(5-cyanopyrazin-2-yl) urea in the checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) enzyme, we modified R4, and to a lesser extent, R2, and R5 of the phenyl ring, and made a variety of N-aryl-N 0 -pyrazinylurea Chk1 inhibitors. Enzymatic activity less than 20 nM was observed in 15 of 41 compounds. Compound 8i provided the best overall results in the cellular assays as it abrogated doxorubicin-induced cell cycle arrest (IC50 = 1.7 lM) and enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity (IC50 = 0.44 lM) while displaying no single agent activity. ” 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

When DNA is damaged by radiation or chemical reagents, normal cells arrest in the G1 phase, via the tumor suppressor protein p53, and attempt repair.1,2 Tumor cells, however, often have mutated p53 and thus, must rely on the S and G2 checkpoints to repair their DNA.1≠3 Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a human nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase. Upon DNA damage, Chk1 is activated and can phosphorylate and destabilize Cdc25A. This phosphorylation is necessary for S and G2 arrest.4,5 Inhibition of Chk1 results in abrogation of arrest in the S and G2 phases, thereby allowing the DNA-damaged cells to progress prematurely into mitosis resulting in mitotic catastrophe or apoptosis.6≠8 Therefore, abrogation of the S and G2 checkpoints should lead to an increased and selective sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damaging reagents in p53-deficient cells.1≠3,9 Thus, selective inhibitors of Chk1 may be of great therapeutic value in cancer treatment. Several compounds such as UCN-01 have been reported as Chk1 inhibitors.10,11 We12,13 and others14,15 recently discovered N-aryl-N 0 -pyrazinylureas to be a new class

of Chk1 inhibitors. Our previous work focused on the modification of R2 of the phenyl ring12,13 (1 wherein R4 = H, Fig. 1). We also synthesized 1-(5-chloro2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(5-cyanopyrazin-2-yl)urea (2, Fig. 1) as a potent Chk1 kinase inhibitor (Chk1 IC50  7 nM).12 Tolerance of the methoxy substituent at R4 of the phenyl ring indicates that some amount of space exists in this region of the Chk1 protein and that other groups may be tolerated, as well. X-ray crystallography of compound 2 in the Chk1 enzyme16 (Fig. 2) showed that R2 points toward the ribose pocket of the Chk1 enzyme, while R4 points toward the solvent front. Based on this, we decided to modify R4 for possible improvement of physical properties such as polarity and solubility while keeping similar potency (1, Fig. 1). Initially, R4 was altered, while R2 and R5 were held constant as the methoxy and chloro moieties,

respectively (Table 1). Later, R2 and R4 were concomitantly altered, while R5 was held constant as the chloro moiety or was removed completely (Table 2). The synthesis and biological results are presented. The synthesis of the urea compounds with various amide substituents at R4 of the phenyl ring is shown in Scheme 1. Methylation of compound 4 provided compound 5, which was refluxed with one equivalent of compound 3 in toluene12,13 to give urea compound 6. Reduction of the nitro group gave intermediate 7, which was subsequently reacted with a variety of acid chlorides to provide compounds 8a≠v. The preparation of compound 15 is shown in Scheme 2. Methylation of compound 9 was followed by nitro group reduction and protection of the resulting amino group with TFAA. The methyl group was then transformed through bromination to benzyl bromide 11, subsequent hydrolysis and oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde 12. Following removal of the trifluoroacetylprotecting group, urea compound 14 was synthesized. Finally, reductive amination achieved compound 15. The preparation of compounds of structure 19 in Scheme 3 began with replacement of the 2-chloro substituent of 2,4,5-trichloronitrobenzene with one equivalent of pyrrolidine.17 Diversity was introduced into the molecule in the next step by replacement of the 4-chloro moiety with a selection of alkyl alcohols. Subsequent reduction followed by urea formation provided compounds 19a≠e. Scheme 4 illustrates the synthesis of compounds of structure 22. Compound 20 was obtained via reflux of compound 16 and 10 equiv of NaOH in water for 3 days.18 Aromatic nucleophilic substitution with 2∞ amines was followed by Mitsunobu reaction with a variety of alcohols and intermediate 21. Nitro group reduction and urea formation completed the synthesis of compounds 22a≠d.

2-dimethylaminoethanol. Subsequent nitro reduction and urea formation provided compound 25. Preparation of compound 29, as shown in Scheme 6, began by amidation of compound 26 with MeNHOMe. LiAlH4 reduction resulted in intermediate 27. Urea formation provided core compound 28. Reductive amination using a variety of secondary amines afforded compounds 29a≠e. Results of the enzymatic assay12,13 of compounds 8a≠v are listed in Table 1. Compounds 8a≠f, which contain flexible chains, provided excellent enzymatic activity ranging from 3 to 23 nM. Compound 8a carries a tertiary aliphatic amine, which is very hydrophilic, and showed the best enzymatic activity (IC50 = 3 nM). Compounds 8b, 8c, and 8f vary in chain length from 5 to 9 atoms, yet they showed little variance in enzymatic activity with IC50's of 22, 18, and 23 nM, respectively. Another subset of compounds we looked at were pyridine-containing compounds 8g≠j. Compounds 8h≠j showed excellent enzymatic activity

compound 6 to the amino group of compound 7 imparted an 8-fold increase in activity. Alternatively, the increased bulk of compound 15 from the reductive amination of compound 14 does not impart a significant change in activity. Compounds 15 and 14 showed very similar potency, 12 and 14 nM, respectively. The SAR of compounds 19a≠e, 22a≠c, and 25 are listed in Table 2. Overall, these compounds showed very good to excellent enzymatic activity with IC50's ranging from 10 to 66 nM. The heteroaliphatic-substituted compounds 19a≠c showed decreased activity with increased chain length. Their IC50's are 10, 25, and 64 nM, respectively. In compounds 22a≠c, R4 was held constant as the methylpiperidinyl moiety, while R2 was modified. Although the R2 modifications ranged in size, polarity, and flexibility, compounds 22a≠c do not differ significantly in activity (IC50 = 38≠66 nM). The SAR of compounds 28 and 29a≠e are also shown in Table 2. Removal of the chloro group from R5 was not detrimental to the ability of these compounds to inhibit Chk1. Direct comparison of compounds 28 and 29a with their chloro-containing counterparts, compounds 14 and 15, respectively, showed a 3-fold decrease for one compound and a slight increase in activity for the other compound. Among compounds 29a≠e, 29a, and 29d gave the best enzymatic activity, 10 and 13 nM, respectively. Compounds 29a≠c all have six-membered heteroaromatic rings, however, compound 29b has a morpholine ring and is 9.6-fold less active than compound 29a. Compound 29c has a methylpiperidine ring and is 7.3-fold less active than compound 29a. A selection of compounds possessing the best IC50 values was also tested in one or more cellular assays, including a MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) cell proliferation assay and FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting).12,13 The MTS assay measures the amount of surviving cells as an assessment

(IC50's = 8≠11 nM). However, compound 8g is inactive (IC50 > 10 lM). Compound 8g differs from compounds 8h and 8i only by placement of the pyridine nitrogen atom. It may be, in this case, that the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring is unable to make the critical interaction needed to impart activity. In compounds 8k≠v, a variety of furan, thiophene, substituted, and unsubstituted phenyl rings were introduced into the molecule. In general, the activities of these compounds are worse than those seen for the compounds that contain heteroaliphatic chains (8a≠f) or pyridine rings (8h≠j, 8g is an exception). However, compound 8u, which possesses the highly polar methylsulfonyl group, is an exception with an IC50 of 7 nM. Compound 8j is 6.4-fold more active than compound 8m. This indicates pyridine rings may provide better interaction with the enzyme than thiophene rings. Compounds 8o, 8r, and 8s, all of which have a phenethyl group, showed similar potencies despite addition or placement of a methoxy substituent with IC50's of 68, 72, and 51 nM, respectively. Compounds 8t and 8u form an interesting comparison. Compound 8u is 195-fold more active than compound 8t. This difference in activity stems from a single structural change, compound 8u has a methylsulfonyl group at the para position of the benzyl ring, while compound 8t has a methoxy group. The enzymatic activity of compounds 6, 7, 14, and 15 is also shown in Table 1. Reduction of the nitro moiety of

for cytotoxicity. FACS analysis measures abrogation of the G2 checkpoint as an indicator of Chk1-based cellular mechanism for the compounds. These data, along with the enzymatic assay data (IC50's), are presented in Table 3 as IC50 values at which the compound reduces cell growth or decreases G2 cells by half. We have defined an ideal result as a compound possessing little or no antiproliferative activity when dosed alone (>59.3 lM in the MTS assay and >10 lM in the FACS assay), but possessing high antiproliferative activity in the presence of doxorubicin (Dox) (ideally 61 lM), thus providing the highest ratio. From the data in Table 3, it is seen that good activity in the enzymatic assay does not always translate into good cellular activity. Factors such as cell permeability can contribute to these differences. Compounds 7, 8b, 8f, and 8j all have potent IC50's ranging from 5 to 23 nM, however, compounds 7, 8b, and 8j have only very weak combination cellular activity: 15, 24.0, and 12.2 lM, respectively. Compound 8f did not show any combination or single agent cellular activity in either the MTS or FACS assay. Overall, the two cellular assays corroborate well with each other. Compound 8i had no single compound activity and showed strong combination activity in the MTS assay. FACS analysis also showed little single compound activity and had some combination activity. An apparent discrepancy between the MTS and FACS assays was observed for compounds 15, 19a, and 29a. However, the different cell lines and compound concentrations used in the two assays could explain the limited variations. The MTS assay uses HeLa cells that are more sensitive than the H1299 cells used in the FACS assay. For example, a single compound EC50 value of 0.83 lM for compound 19a in the MTS assay became 3.66 lM in the FACS assay. Moreover, the MTS assay measures proliferation, while FACS analysis evaluates Chk1-based cellular mechanism. The two parameters may vary in the cell lines. The single compound activities for compounds 15 and 29a in the MTS assay were not detected in the FACS assay because the maximum concentration for FACS was only 10 lM. For combination treatments, all three of

the compounds showed activity in both assays. Of the compounds tested, 8i showed the best overall results among all three assays possessing an IC50 of 8 nM, MTS single agent activity for compound alone of >59.3 lM and combination activity with doxorubicin of 0.44 lM, and a ratio of single agent to combination activity of >10.0 lM/1.7 lM in the FACS assay. In addition, compounds 8a and 8u also showed moderate to good activity having 9.7- and 19.1-fold MTS single/ combination ratios, respectively. In summary, we have modified R4 of the urea phenyl ring with a variety of chemical structures, and R2 and R5 to some degree. Several compounds showed very promising results as potent and selective Chk1 inhibitors. In particular, compound 8i showed very good results throughout the enzymatic and cellular assays. Although we have progressed toward our goal of finding a potent and selective Chk1 inhibitor, additional work is needed to obtain greater insight into the SAR of these compounds. References and notes
