Cathepsin K is a cysteine protease located primarily in osteoclasts that plays a crucial role in bone resorption.1 Cathepsin K cleaves type I collagen and other components of the bone matrix. Inhibition of this process should decrease bone resorption and help correct the imbalance in bone remodelling which favors bone resorption over bone formation.

Leu-Nle-H) as a potent inhibitor of cathepsin K (IC50=0.11 nM).2,3 Further focussed screening of close analogues to calpeptin pinpointed the truncated analogue 2l (Boc-Nle-H) as a cathepsin K inhibitor (IC50= 51 nM). Although the norleucine-based aldehyde 2l was nearly 500-fold less potent than calpeptin 1, its small size and absence of peptide bonds made it an excellent starting lead to develop cathepsin K inhibitors. Initial efforts focussed on exploring the S1 subsite via alterations of the P1 moiety and are detailed in this report. The primary synthetic route to P1 aldehyde analogues 2 is depicted in Scheme 1. Whenever possible the aldehydes 2 were synthesized from commercially available amino acids 3, tert-butyloxycarbonyl amino acids 4, or tert-butyloxycarbonyl amino alcohols 5. Other amino acids were prepared according to literature precedent. Amino acids 3 were protected using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and aqueous sodium hydroxide.4 The protected amino acids 4 were then reduced to the amino alcohols 5 via the mixed anhydride method using isopropyl chloroformate and sodium borohydride.5 Moffatt oxidation of the alcohols 5 afforded the aldehydes 2 after an extractive work up without further purification.6 The yields of the reduction and oxidation steps as well the cathepsin K activity of P1 aldehyde analogues 2 are shown in Table 1.

As part of a more extensive effort to develop new treatments for bone disorders, this group sought to discover cathepsin K inhibitors. A preliminary screen of known aldehyde inhibitors of cysteine and serine proteases in our compound collection identified calpeptin 1 (Cbz* Corresponding author.

The synthesis of alcohols 5n­p is shown in Scheme 3. Employing the Corey­Fuchs protocol, aldehyde 8 was converted to a dibromoolefin then treated with butyl lithium. The resulting acetylene anion was trapped with methyl iodine to yield the alkyne 9.9 Acidic hydrolysis of acetylene 9 cleaved the acetonide with the concomitant loss of the tert-butyl carbamate. The resulting amine was reprotected to provide the alcohol 5p.10 Metal/ammonia reduction of alkyne 5p yielded the trans alkene 5o.11 Lindlar hydrogenation of the same alkyne 5p gave the cis olefin 5n.12 A series of compounds that contain P1 side chains that feature a tethered phenyl or cyclohexyl ring was also made. As depicted in Scheme 4, alcohols 5ab and 5ad were prepared by reduction of the corresponding aryl analogues 5aa and 5ac, respectively.13 A series of aldehydes incorporating nitrogen functionality (amide/carbamate groups) into the P1 position was also investigated. The synthesis of alcohols 5ag­ah is shown in Scheme 5. The orthogonally protected diaminoacids 10 were reduced to the alcohols. Subsequent Fmoc removal afforded the amines 11 which were reacted with methyl chloroformate to provide methylcarbamates 5ag (n=1­3).14 The lysine derivative 5ah (n=4) was synthesized from the methyl ester 12. Conversion of the free amine to the methyl carbamate and subsequent hydrolysis of the ester afforded the acid 13 (n=4). Then, reduction of the acid 13 as previously described gave the alcohol 5ah (n=4). Oxidation of alcohol 5ag (n=1) as in Scheme 1 afforded the aldehyde 2ag (n=1). However, the extended amine derivatives (n=2­3) cyclized to the five- and six-membered hemiaminals upon oxidation. Alcohol 5ah (n=4) gave a mixture of aldehyde 2ah and seven-membered hemiaminals upon oxidation.

The synthesis of alcohol 5r is shown in Scheme 2.

to have good potency. Cathepsin K inhibitory activity of phenylglycinal 2w is 51 nM. The phenylalaninal analogue 2y is the least active member of this series (IC50=110 nM). Activity then increases with the phenethyl derivative 2aa (IC50=30 nM) and the phenpropyl analogue 2ac (IC50=15 nM). The cyclohexyl derivatives are also potent inhibitors of cathepsin K. The cyclohexyl glycine derivative 2x is roughly as potent as the propyl analogue 2f. It is interesting to note that the branching at the beta carbon does not lead to the same decrease in activity observed in 2d. The methyl-, ethyland propylcyclohexyl analogues 2z, 2ab, and 2ad, respectively, are potent inhibitors with IC50s of 36, 26, and 16 nM. These results appear to show that no favorable p­p interactions have been picked up by presence of an aryl group in these analogues. The electronics of the S1 subsite were probed by substituting heteroatoms into the P1 group. Incorporation of polar heteroatoms into the side chain close to the amino acid backbone leads to decreased cathepsin K inhibitory activity. Ether analogues 2s and 2u are over 10-fold less potent than the norleucinal 2l. Amine derivative 2ag (IC50=370 nM) is also less potent than 2l (IC50=51 nM). Sulfur is an exception to this trend. With available d orbitals and more diffuse electron lone pairs, the `soft' sulfur is closer to carbon than it is to oxygen or nitrogen. The thioethers 2t and 2v are equipotent with the butyl analogue 2l. In contrast to P1 side chains with `hard' heteroatoms close to the amino acid backbone like 2ag, the ornithine 2aj and lysine derivatives 2ah, 2ak, and 2al are among the more potent aldehydes surveyed. Thus, inhibitor solubility could be enhanced by these P1 groups. During our SAR investigations, an X-ray co-crystal structure of inhibitor 2x bound to the active site of cathepsin K was obtained (Fig. 1). The structure lends some support to the observed SAR of these P1 analogues. The S1 binding site is more aptly described as a wall rather than pocket, since one half of the subsite is solvent exposed. It is created by residues 23Gly, 24Ser, 64 Gly, and 65Gly. All of the polar backbone atoms that form the wall are hydrogen bonded which results in the subsite having a very hydrophobic character, explaining the preference for linear hydrophobic substituents in this position. Furthermore, P1 side chains with `hard' heteroatoms close to the amino acid backbone should have unfavorable interactions with this hydrophobic enzyme surface. However, the enzyme wall is not extre° mely large ($ 5 A in length). Thus, heteroatoms attached by longer tethers should eventually become exposed to solvent. In accord with this, lysine and orni-

With the aim of preventing hemiaminal formation, a series of methylated trifluoroacetamides was synthesized. As shown in Scheme 6, the amines 11 (n=2­4) were converted into the trifluoroacetamides 5ak (n=2­ 4).15 The trifluoroacetamides were then deprotonated with sodium hydride, followed by alkylation with methyl iodide to give the tertiary amides 5ai, 5aj, and 5al.16 Moffat oxidation of the alcohols 5 as in Scheme 1 afforded the aldehydes 2. With an X-ray crystal structure of cathepsin K unavailable at the start of this work, a traditional structure­ activity relationship study was employed varying steric and electronic properties of the P1 moiety. As shown in Table 1, an n-alkyl side chain of 1­6 carbons leads to an increase in cathepsin K activity over the glycine derivative 2a. The alanine derivative 2b is roughly 30-fold more potent than the glycine analogue 2a. The longer linear P1 side chain aldehydes like 2c, 2f, and 2l have equivalent potency and are slightly more potent than the alanine derivative 2b. Additional substitution of the a-carbon of the side chain is detrimental to enzyme inhibitory activity (compare 2c to 2d or 2f to 2g and 2h) with the fully substituted 2e being roughly 900-fold less potent than 2c. Steric branching at the b-carbon of the P1 side chain appears to be tolerated (compare 2f and 2j) although potency does drop off in the fully substituted case 2k. Incorporation of p-bonds into the P1 side chain gave mixed results. The Z-alkene 2n was experimentally indistinguishable from the norleucine analogue 2l, while the E-alkene 2o is 4-fold less active. The alkyne 2p is 10-fold less potent than Z-alkene 2n. Hoping to pick up favorable p­p stacking interactions with potential aryl groups in the S1 subsite, a phenyl ring was attached to the amino acid backbone with varying tether lengths. These P1 side chains were found

in the enzymatic assay. Tethered ring substituents provided similar potencies, but might be less attractive for further investigation because of synthetic complexity and increased size. Long alkyl chains with polar caps are well tolerated and could potentially add aqueous solubility. Information gained from these studies has proved to be useful in the design of other cathepsin K inhibitors. These inhibitors will be reported in due course.

thine derivatives like 2ah and 2aj are well tolerated. The hydrophobic portions of their tethers are able to make favorable contacts with the S1 wall, while their polar ends can reach above the wall and into a solventexposed region. Other interactions also contribute to the binding of these inhibitors. The t-butyl group is bound in the deep S2 pocket formed by residues 67Tyr, 68Met, 134Ala, 163 Ala, and 209Leu and hydrophobic groups would be preferred based on the `greasy' nature of these residues. A covalent hemithioketal intermediate is formed by the aldehyde of the inhibitor and the active site cysteine (25Cys) of the protein. The OH of the hemithioketal is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds to the backbone amide of 25Cys and the sidechain of 19Gln. Two other hydrogen bonds formed by the inhibitor occur in the peptide recognition site: the NH and carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor carbamate form hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of 161Asn and the backbone HN of 66 Gly, respectively. A series of aldehyde inhibitors of cathepsin K with varied substituents at the P1 position has been synthesized. Linear alkanes were some of the more potent analogues
