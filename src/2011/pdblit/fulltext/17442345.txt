MOA (Marasmius oreades agglutinin), a lectin isolated from fruiting bodies of the mushroom M. oreades, specifically binds nonreducing terminal Gal(1,3) Gal carbohydrates, such as that which occurs in the xenotransplantation epitope Gal(1,3)Gal(1,4)GlcNAc and the branched blood group B determinant Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal. Here, we present the crystal structure of MOA in complex with the blood group B trisaccharide solved at 1.8 Å resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first blood-group-B-specific structure reported in complex with a blood group B determinant. The carbohydrate ligand binds to all three binding sites of the N-terminal trefoil domain. Also, in this work, Ca2+ was included in the crystals, and binding of Ca2+ to the MOA homodimer altered the conformation of the Cterminal domain by opening up the cleft containing a putative catalytic site.

Introduction
In the early 1950s, a substance from the fairy ring mushroom Marasmius oreades was shown to agglutinate human type B erythrocytes.1,2 The active substance was later identified as the lectin MOA (M. oreades agglutinin), a dimer of 293-residue protomers isolated from fruiting bodies of the mushroom.3,4 MOA has been shown to specifically

recognize the carbohydrate Gal(1,3)Gal present in human blood group B structures and in the so-called xenotransplantation epitope.3,5,6 The blood groups of the ABH system are determined by specific carbohydrate structures presented on the cell surface of erythrocytes. Lectins have become important tools in the identification of different blood groups since they are proteins with high specificity for particular carbohydrates and their multivalent binding sites can agglutinate red blood cells. There are only a few lectins that have been reported to be specific for blood group B structures, and MOA is one of them. Other lectins possessing this characteristic are the lectin GS-I-B4 from the plant Griffonia simplicifolia,7 a lectin from the red algae Ptilota plumosa,8 and a lectin from the eggs of the fish Plecoglossus altivelis.9 Among these, only the GS-I-B 4 lectin has been structurally characterized.10,11 We have earlier determined the crystal structure of MOA in complex with the xenotransplantation epitope Gal(1,3)Gal(1,4)GlcNAc.12 The structure

458 revealed that the protein has two distinct domains: an N-terminal lectin domain with a ricinB fold (also known as a -trefoil fold) exhibiting three distinct carbohydrate-binding subdomains, and a C-terminal domain involved in dimer formation, which displays some features resembling catalytically active proteins. 12 Here, we present the crystal structure of MOA in complex with the branched blood group B trisaccharide Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal to 1.8 Å resolution. This structure shows welldefined electron density for the trisaccharide ligand in all three distinct binding sites on each protomer. The binding of two Ca2+ ions as a binuclear center close to the hypothetical active site in the C-terminal domain causes a conformational change within this domain that changes the surface of the dimer, creating a flat surface and a large cleft facing the potential active site.

otherwise continuous electron density. Included in the final model are 12 trisaccharide molecules, 16 Ca2+ ions (of which 8 are tightly bound at the dimer interfaces as binuclear centers), 4 acetate ions, 1259 water molecules, and residues 2­293 of the 4 protein molecules. The first residue (Met1) is not included in the model since it is only partly visible in the electron density map. The four protein molecules are essentially identical, and the root-mean-square distances (r.m.s.d.) between C atoms vary between 0.036 and 0.038 Å when comparing pairwise the four protomers (named A, B, C, and D). In this text, only molecule A or the A/B dimer is discussed, if not stated otherwise. Carbohydrate binding The N-terminal domain of MOA (residues 2­156) adopts a -trefoil fold as found in many carbohydrate-binding proteins. The pseudo-3-fold symmetry of the -trefoil fold creates three potential carbohydrate-binding sites referred to as , , and . When comparing the protein structure of this domain for the two available MOA structures­the complex with the xenotransplantation epitope Gal(1,3)Gal(1,4)GlcNAc [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 2IHO] and the complex with the blood group B trisaccharide Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal (PDB ID 3EF2)­it is found that the overall conformation of the N-terminal domain is preserved irrespective of which sugar molecule is bound (r.m.s.d. = 0.2 Å when comparing all C atoms of the domain). In the structure of the xenotransplantation complex, carbohydrate binding was found to be strongest at the -site, second strongest at the -site, and weakest at the -site, where no carbohydrate molecule was included in the model. 12 In the structure of the blood group B complex, the electron density map is continuous, strong, and easily interpretable in all three binding sites, and all three trisaccharide molecules have accordingly been included in the model. All carbohydrates are modeled with an occupancy of 1.0; when comparing the average temperature factor for the trisaccharide, it was lowest for the -site, second lowest for the site, and highest for the -site (Table 2). The structure of the branched blood group B trisaccharide alone has been studied both by X-ray crystallography and by NMR.15 The agreement between the two structures was excellent, indicating nearly identical conformations in solution and in the crystal.15 The same preferred conformation of this relatively rigid carbohydrate molecule is observed also when it is bound to MOA, as reported here. A superimposition shows that the bound and unbound structures have almost identical conformations, and the glycosidic torsion angles are also similar (Table 3). MOA specifically recognizes Gal(1,3)Gal-terminating carbohydrates, and the two galactose residues are bound in extended shallow grooves on the MOA surface. The binding of the two galactose residues to the - and -sites is very similar to that

Results and Discussion
Quality of the structure The structure of MOA in complex with the branched blood group B trisaccharide Gal(1,3) [Fuc(1,2)]Gal has been determined. The complex was crystallized in space group P3, and the structure was solved to 1.8 Å resolution (Table 1). MOA forms a homodimer (Fig. 1a), and the asymmetric unit contains four MOA protomers arranged as two dimers. The electron density map is of good quality and was easily interpretable for both protein and carbohydrate (Fig. 1b). Exceptions are the side chain of Asn55 for which no electron density is visible and a break between residues Gly205 and Ser206 in the

xenotransplantation complex structure, the two galactose residues bind analogously to the binding in the -site, but with slightly shorter bond lengths and a few more direct contacts with the protein. Superimposition of the two galactose residues of the Gal(1,3)Gal(1,4)GlcNAc trisaccharide onto the two corresponding galactose residues of Gal(1,3) [Fuc(1,2)]Gal indicates no steric hindrance that could explain the weak binding to the -site in the xenotransplantation epitope complex structure. However, in the present P3 crystal form, the sugar bound in the -site is involved in water-mediated crystal packing contacts with a neighboring protein molecule within the crystal, which may explain the improved binding of the ligand to the -site compared to the structure published earlier.

Adding an L-fucosyl group to Gal(1,3)Gal to afford the branched blood group B trisaccharide Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal has been reported to

enhance the binding affinity to MOA fivefold.3 In the complex between MOA and the blood group B trisaccharide, fucose points away from the protein surface. There are no direct hydrogen bonds between fucose atoms and the protein in any of the binding sites. The only potential intracarbohydrate hydrogen bond involving a fucose residue is formed between fucose O5 and Gal O1 in the -site (distance 3.3 Å); however, there are strong intracarbohydrate van der Waals contacts ( 4 Å) between fucose and foremost Gal. The shortest distance (3.9 Å) between the fucose and the protein is found in the -site (Fig. 2b): this is the carbon­carbon distance from C6 of the fucose to C of Trp44. In addition, all three binding sites exhibit significant water-mediated interactions involving the fucose: In the -site, a water molecule within hydrogenbonding distance (3.2 Å) of fucose O5 is also situated within hydrogen-bonding distance (3.1 Å) of the amino nitrogen of Trp44 (Fig. 2b; Table 4).

461 interactions and prestabilization of the branched structure due to strong intracarbohydrate van der Waals contacts. In the - and -sites, there is evidence in the electron density map for binding of either anomer of the reducing galactose unit Gal. For each site, only the anomer having the highest occupancy is included in the model: -Gal in the -site and -Gal in the site. In the -site, only the  anomer is observed. Comparison with other Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal complexes Among the published structures deposited in the PDB to date, two protein complexes have the same bound ligand as used in this study, namely, the blood group B trisaccharide Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)] Gal. One structure involves the P domain from the VA387 norovirus capsid protein that utilizes human blood group antigens as receptors during the infection process. 16 The P domain binds both blood group A and group B antigens, mainly interacting with the fucose residue common to both antigens. The other protein is the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of an endo--galactosidase from the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, which is virulent to both animals and humans.17 This CBM also binds both blood group A and B antigens and, in the complex, all three sugar residues contribute to the interaction. However, no direct interactions are evident for either the 2acetamidogroup of GalNAc in the blood group A determinant or the O2 oxygen of Gal in the blood group B determinant. MOA differs from these two proteins in having specificity for the blood group B determinant only, because of both direct and watermediated hydrogen bonds to the O2 oxygen of Gal. The larger acetamido group cannot be accommodated in the binding site due to steric interference. Despite the differences in binding modes, the conformations of the trisaccharide molecules are similar (Table 3). C-terminal domain

site (Fig. 2c), none of the fucose atoms is closer to the protein than 4.6 Å, but there is a strong indirect interaction between the fucose O5, a water molecule, and Asn95 O1 (the distances are 2.9 Å between O5 and the water molecule and 2.8 Å between the water molecule and the protein). The situation in the -site (Fig. 2d) is very similar to the one in the -site, with no fucose­protein distances being shorter than 4.5 Å. Here, two water molecules mediate hydrogen bonds to the protein. The first water molecule simultaneously binds to fucose O5 and to O1 of Asn146 (with both distances being 2.8 Å), and the second water molecule binds to fucose O2 and Glu144 O1 (with distances of 2.9 Å each). According to Winter et al., the increase in binding affinity due to the fucose residue has both enthalpic and entropic contributions.3 Based on the crystal structure reported here, these contributions are likely to result mainly from water-mediated

In contrast to the N-terminal domain, which is essentially identical in the two MOA structures, there is a pronounced difference in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3a and b). A structural superimposition of the C-terminal domain (residues 157­293) of the blood group B complex and the xenotransplantation epitope complex (PDB ID 2IHO) gives an r.m.s.d. of 1.8 Å for the protein C atoms, although individual atoms move as much as 16 Å. The parts that differ most and that had to be completely rebuilt in the blood group B trisaccharide complex model are residues 172­184, 247­257, and 283­293. These residues form three loops that are closely juxtaposed, facing the outside of the dimer. The observed structural changes in the C-terminal domain are caused by the tight and specific binding of four calcium ions bound as two binuclear centers to the dimer interface (Figs. 1a and 3c). In particular,

residues 182 and 183 completely change orientation upon calcium binding, thereby dragging the neighboring residues along (Fig. 3b). The two calcium ions per binuclear center are located 3.85 Å apart at the dimer interface. One of the ions is coordinated by the main chain oxygen of residue 211; the carboxylates of aspartic acid residues 214, 216, and 217 from one protomer; and aspartic acid residue 183 from the other protomer and one

water molecule. The coordination is pentagonal bipyramidal (metal­donor distances b2.5 Å), and such a coordination is commonly observed for divalent calcium ions.18,19 The average temperature factor for this Ca2+ is 8.8 Å2. The second calcium ion is coordinated by the carboxylates of aspartic acid residues 214 and 216 from one protomer, as well as aspartic acid residue 183 and the main chain oxygen of residue 182 from the other protomer and two

463 These three residues are Cys215, His257, and Glu274. In the structure of MOA in complex with the blood group B trisaccharide and Ca2+, those residues are found even closer to each other. The electron density map indicates that the side chain of Cys215 is oxidized in about 50% of the molecules in the crystal (Fig. 4a). This is true for all four polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit. In the model that has been deposited in the PDB (PDB ID 3EF2), only the oxidized form is included, with an occupancy of 1.0.

water molecules, one of which has a lower occupancy. This second calcium ion does not have a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination but rather an octahedral one, and the average temperature factor for this Ca2+ is 11.1 Å2. When we first solved the structure of MOA in complex with the xenotransplantation epitope (PDB ID 2IHO) and the C-terminal domain was compared with structures available in the PDB, three residues in MOA were identified as members of a potential catalytic triad in a putative active site.12

The electron density map (final 2Fo - Fc map contoured at 1.0) is shown for protein side chains. Cys215 is oxidized in about 50% of the molecules in the crystal; the oxidized form (green carbons) and the reduced form (orange carbons) are both depicted. The side chain of Trp208 and the unassigned electron density adjacent to it are also shown in this picture.

Coloring scheme for the protein surface: positive charge (blue), negative charge (red), hydrophobic (white), polar N (light blue), polar O (pink), and sulfurs (yellow). The potential catalytic triad is highlighted in green, and trisaccharides are shown in yellow, orange, and red when bound to the -, -, and -sites, respectively. (b and c) Two alternative views related to each other by a 90° rotation around a vertical axis.

464 As a consequence of the conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding, the surface of the MOA dimer is slightly changed, and a wide and deep cleft is formed, in which the three residues of the potential catalytic triad are clustered at one side and are readily accessible (Fig. 4b and c). The conformational change also affects the dimer interface. The buried surface area on each protomer upon dimer formation is reduced from 1800 Å2 in the structure without Ca2+ to 1370 Å2 in the structure with Ca2+. For each protomer, the number of residues forming the interaction surface decreases from 49 to 39, and the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds decreases from 21 to 19 as a result of Ca2+ binding. Crystal packing MOA was crystallized in complex with the trisaccharide Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal. The space group of the crystals is P3, with four protomers in the asymmetric unit. The four protomers are arranged as two homodimers, and the molecules are tightly packed within the crystal. Three -sites meet at the crystallographic 3-fold axis, bringing the carbohydrate molecules close to each other at this axis. The O1 oxygen of Gal hydrogen bonds to both O2 and O3 of fucose in the neighboring trisaccharide molecule with distances of 2.9 Å each. The involvement of this hydroxyl group in crystal-packing interactions in the -site explains why this galactose residue is only found as a anomer and not as a mixture of - and -anomers, as observed for the carbohydrates bound in the - and -sites. In the -site, there are no crystal packing interactions, whereas in the -site, water-mediated crystal contacts are observed. When MOA was earlier cocrystallized with the trisaccharide Gal(1,3)Gal(1,4)GlcNAc in space groups P21 and P3221 and in the absence of Ca2+, the same kind of homodimer was formed, but the packing of the dimers within the crystal was very different.12,20

MOA in Complex with Blood Group B Determinant

Implications
MOA has been shown to have a high affinity for nonreducing terminal Gal(1,3)Gal carbohydrates, especially the xenotransplantation epitope Gal(1,3)Gal(1,4)GlcNAc and the blood group B determinant Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal.3,5,6 Now the crystal structures of MOA in complex with both these trisaccharides have been solved. For the complex with the xenotransplantation epitope differences in binding were observed for the three binding sites.12 For the blood group B trisaccharide complex, on the other hand, electron density indicates uniform binding of the trisaccharide to all three binding sites. This shows that all three sites are capable of binding the carbohydrate ligand, despite slight differences in the protein surfaces of the three sites. Unexpectedly, the P3 crystal form of MOA presented in this work was found to bind calcium

ions. This was not the case for earlier crystal forms, which did not contain calcium in the crystallization buffers. Binding of metals is a common theme in proteins. They can stabilize the protein three-dimensional structure by neutralizing charges in the protein and thereby bringing different parts of the protein closer together than what would be possible otherwise. In addition, many enzymes use metals for their catalytic activities. Ca2+ is often found both as a stabilizer of the structure and as a trigger, inducing conformational changes upon sensing calcium concentration in the environment.21,22 The biological function of MOA is still unknown. When the first crystal structure of the protein was solved, we suggested that the C-terminal domain of the protein might have an enzymatic function, in addition to the well-known carbohydrate-binding properties of the N-terminal domain.12 In the MOA structure presented here, a binuclear Ca2+ center is observed directly next to the potential active site. Calcium binding induces a conformational change in the protein that changes the surface of the dimer and opens up a cleft with a large and flat surface, which might provide the binding site for a large substrate molecule. The proposed catalytic triad (Cys215, His257, and Glu274) is situated in one corner of this cleft, and the side chain of Trp208 is close to the side chain of Cys215 and may contribute to substrate binding by stacking interactions­ unassigned electron density is seen adjacent to this residue in both the present and the earlier MOA structures (Fig. 4a). The side chain of Cys215 seems to be accessible and reactive since it was observed to bind a MalNEt molecule (N-ethylmaleimide) in the earlier structure and is found to be oxidized in the present structure. It should, however, be kept in mind that no catalytic function is yet assigned to MOA and that the discussion about substrates and catalytically important residues is speculative. It also needs to be shown if calcium is the preferred metal at all sites also under biological conditions. A database search for proteins with a sequence similar to that of MOA only yielded one hit­the mushroom Polyporus squamosus lectin (PSL). PSL also has an N-terminal -trefoil domain and a Cterminal domain of unknown function.23 When comparing the sequences of MOA and PSL1a (the first isoform of PSL), it is found that not only the three residues suggested to be part of a catalytic triad but also the four aspartic acid residues taking part in specific calcium binding and the tryptophan residue found close to the potential active site are conserved in both proteins. In summary, we have solved the structure of MOA in complex with the branched blood group B trisaccharide and Ca2+ and compared it to the structures of other complexes binding the same ligand reported in the literature. The MOA structure stands out as the only structure that specifically recognizes blood group B determinants. The specific binding to blood group B-structures is achieved by both direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the O2 oxygen of Gal. Blood group A structures,

which are slightly larger due to the replacement of Gal by a GalNAc residue, would not fit into the MOA-binding site due to steric interference. Binding to MOA is enhanced compared to the xenotransplantation epitope investigated earlier. According to our structural data, the additional fucosyl residue mainly contributes to binding via water-mediated interactions. The natural ligand and the biological function of MOA are, however, still unknown. In this context, the chance finding that MOA binds two Ca2+ ions in the putative active site at the dimer interface may yield new clues as to the function of this protein. Ca 2+ binding is associated with significant conformational changes in the MOA Cterminal domain, whereas the N-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain is unaffected.

First, manual building of the parts that differed from the 2IHO structure (residues 173­184, 247­257, and 283­293) was performed in Coot.29 Thereafter, further rebuilding in Coot was alternated with refinement using Refmac5.30 Sugar molecules and calcium and acetate ions were incorporated into the model before water molecules were added using the Arp/wArp function in Refmac5 (density N 2.5). The two weakly bound ions per protomer have been modeled as Ca2+; however, their identities are ambiguous. The shape of the electron density and the coordination indicates nonwater identities. The coordination is, in both cases, mainly oxygen-mediated, with the minimum distance to the protein being 3.6 Å. Refinement statistics are given in Table 2. For the final model, Rfree = 18.9% and Rcryst = 16.4%. R.m.s.d. values have been calculated using the program O.31 Accession number The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited at the PDB with PDB ID 3EF2.

Materials and Methods
Isolation and purification MOA was isolated from the fruiting bodies of M. oreades and purified as described earlier.3,4 The purified protein was dialyzed against water and lyophilized before being dissolved in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5) to a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. The branched blood group B trisaccharide Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal was purchased from Dextra Laboratories Ltd. UK and dissolved to a concentration of 10 mM in water. Protein (20 mg/ml) and sugar (10 mM) were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:1 before crystallization. Crystallization Small rod-shaped crystals of MOA cocrystallized with Gal(1,3)[Fuc(1,2)]Gal were obtained in 0.1 M Hepes buffer (pH 6.5), 0.2 M calcium acetate, and 18% polyethylene glycol 8000 using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique at room temperature. To test whether addition of various compounds could improve crystal quality, the additive screen MD1-11 from Molecular Dynamics Ltd. UK was employed. The largest crystals grew upon the addition of 0.02 M betaine, and these crystals were used for data collection. Crystals with dimensions of 0.02 mm × 0.02 mm × 0.3 mm were frozen in liquid nitrogen without the addition of any extra cryoprotectant. Data collection, processing, scaling, and structure determination A data set was collected at ID14-2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The wavelength was 0.934 Å, and 200 images with 1° oscillation were collected. The images were processed using MOSFLM24 and scaled with SCALA.25,26 Scaling statistics are given in Table 1. The crystals belong to space group P3 with cell parameters a = 121.3 Å, b = 121.3 Å, and c = 100.0 Å. There are four MOA protomers in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a Matthews coefficient27 of VM = 3.34 Å3/Da and a solvent content of 63%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with one protomer from the earlier MOA structure (PDB ID 2IHO) as search model using the program MOLREP.28
