Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has recently attracted attention as a new target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.1 GLP-1 is secreted by the gastrointestinal tract in response to food intake to stimulate insulin secretion.2 Elevated levels of GLP-1 lead to an increased insulin release and an improved glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients.3 The level of circulating GLP-1 can be increased by inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV),4 which is responsible for the rapid degradation of this hormone.5 Consequently, DPP-IV inhibitors have been explored as potential new medicines.6 In a search for novel DPP-IV inhibitors, we identified aminomethylpyrimidine 1 in a high-throughput screen. As part of an evaluation of this screening hit, we prepared 2a as a pyridine analogue of 1. Similar to 1, 2a was found to be a weak inhibitor of DPP-IV.7

the piperonyl substituent of 1 by a 2,4-dichlorophenyl substituent has led to a large activity increase in the pyrimidine series.8 The structural similarity between the pyrimidine and the pyridine series prompted us to prepare the corresponding dichlorophenyl-pyridine 2b (Table 1). As anticipated, 2b was about 50-fold more active than 2a. Rotational restriction was explored as a possibility of further optimisation. The 6-phenyl­pyridine bond of 2b can be locked by the introduction of an alkylidene tether R (Table 1, 2c­e). The torsional minimum of the phenyl­pyridine bond, as calculated by the program Moloc (MAB force field),9 depends on the length of the tether R, with shorter tethers leading to smaller angles. Locking the torsion to smaller angles led to increasingly active compounds, from 2c over 2d to 2e, with indenopyridine 2e being three orders of magnitude more active than 2a.

DPP-IV inhibitors were measured for their ability to inhibit DPP-IV mediated cleavage of Ala-Pro-7-amido-4trifluoromethylcoumarin in a fluorogenic assay. All compounds were measured in triplicate at 5­7 concentrations in the range of 100 lM to 100 pM. IC50 values were calculated with a nonlinear best fit regression model. All assays were calibrated with NVP-DPP728 as internal standard inhibitor. NVP-DPP728 under the conditions of the assay showed an IC50 of 15+/)4 nM (M+/)SD, n ¼ 12) at 50 lM substrate concentration and a Ki of 11+/)3 nM determined at substrate concentration range of 10 lM to 600 lM. IC50 values of unknown compounds were accepted when the IC50 (x) measured for NVPDPP728 in the assay was 11 < x < 19 nM. 8.

Compound 2e was further derivatised to investigate the influence of substitution on its inhibitory activity. The introduction of small single substituents into the 7- or 8position gave generally less active compounds (2f­j, Table 2). For instance, a 7-MeO or a 8-MeO substituent caused a 2-fold (2f vs 2e) or a 3-fold (2i vs 2e) drop in activity, respectively. Surprisingly, a combination of the seemingly unfavourable 7-MeO and 8-MeO substituents in one molecule resulted in an improved, low nanomolar inhibitor, 2k.

Aminomethylpyridines 2 were accessed as outlined in Scheme 1: a-arylketones 3 were reacted with malononitriles 4 in the presence of ammonia to give 3-cyanopyridines 5,10 which were subsequently reduced to 3-aminomethylpyridines 2.11 Chiral analytical HPLC revealed that 2e was obtained as a mixture of enantiomers. We assume that the chirality of 2e arises from a restricted rotation of the dichlorophenyl­pyridine bond, caused by the steric bulk of adjacent substituents, leading to a chiral axis and atropisomerism. Compounds 2c,d,f­k carry similar substituents and are therefore presumably also chiral. Compounds 2c­k were tested as (putative) racemates. In summary, a series of pyridine DPP-IV inhibitors 2 was derived from a weakly active pyrimidine screening
