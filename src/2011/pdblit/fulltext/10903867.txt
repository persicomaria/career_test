Abstract
In this study a polymorphism in the conjugating activity of human erythrocyte cytosol towards the dihaloethane, ethylene dibromide (EDB; 1,2-dibromoethane) was found. Two out of 12 human erythrocyte cytosols did not catalyze the formation of glutathione (GSH) conjugates of [1,2-` 4C]EDE;. Ten cytosols formed the S,S' -ethylenebis(GSH) conjugate at a rate ranging from 0.5 to 3.2 (mean 1.76 + 0.95) pmol min-' (mg protein)-` . The activity of the cytosols towards EDB was compared with the activity towards 1,2-epoxy-3-( p-nitrophenoxy)-propane (EPNP) and I-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). The GSH conjugates formed from EDB, EPNP and CDNB were all quantified by HPLC. Every cytosol was active with the classical GST substrate CDNB (2.04 + 0.74 nmol min-' (mg protein)-` ). The two samples not showing any detectable activity towards EDB were also inactive towards EPNP: The activity towards EDB correlated significantly with EPNP (rs = 0.90, P < 0.005; Spearman' rank correlation), but not with CDNB (rs = 0.36, P > 0.10). s In the incubations with EPNP, the alpha-, mu-, and pi- class glutathione S-transferase (GST) inhibitor S-hexyl(GSH) was included, indicating that the class-theta GST is the principal GST class conjugating EDB in erythrocyte cytosol. The apparent polymorphism of GST-theta which has recently been recognized to be crucial for several mono- and dihalomethanes, will thus also have considerable implications for the risk assessment of EDB.

1. Introduction
Ethylene dibromide (EDB; 1,2_dibromoethane) has been

used widely as ` anti-knock' additive in gasolines and as a fumigant. EDB is a mutagen [1,2], and has been found to be carcinogenic in animal studies [3-S]. Human data on carcinogenicity are inconclusive so far [6,7]. In vivo, EDB can be metabolized by two pathways, viz.

a cytochrome P-450- and a glutathione (GSH)-dependent pathway. Cytochrome P-450 enzymes (EC 1.14.14.1) are the major catalysts involved in the oxidation of xenobiotics [8,9]. The cytochrome P-450-dependent oxidative metabolism of methylene chloride is considered to be a saturable route [lo], in which for humans the P-450 isoenzyme IIEl is the major, if not the only catalyst involved in the oxidation of the related EDB and a series of related [ 111.` Glutathione S-transferases (GST) (EC compounds 2.5.1.18) catalyse the GSH conjugation of EDB, which produces a reactive intermediate in which the sulfur atom of the initially formed conjugate reacts intramolecularly to give a thiiranium ion by eliminating the halogen from the neighbouring carbon atom [12,13]. This intermediate was identified to be the main DNA-reacting species and may thus be the ultimate carcinogen [14].

The GST multigene family of isoenzymes catalyses the reaction of numerous electrophilic compounds with GSH [15-181. The GST have been organized in four classes, viz., alpha, mu, pi [19], and theta [20]. The GSH conjugating activity of isoenzymes of alpha-, mu-, and pi-class GST towards EDB has been studied. The human alpha-class GST was considerably more effective in its ability to conjugate EDB with GSH as compared with the mu- and pi-class [21]. However, recently attention has also been drawn to the GST theta class, since the expression of the rat theta- class GST 5-5 in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 efficiently activated EDB and several related dihaloalkanes to mutagenic agents [22]. A genetic polymorphism in the human theta-class GSTTl has been detected [23], which corresponds to the polymorphism in GSH conjugating activity towards several structurally related mono- and dihalomethanes, e.g., methyl chloride/bromide and methylene chloride [24-261. In this paper we describe a set of experiments designed to determine whether a polymorphism in the GSH conjugation towards EDB is present in the cytosol derived from human erythrocytes. This activity was compared with the GSH conjugation activity towards I-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 1,2-epoxy-3-c p-nitrophenoxy)-propane (EPNP), two classical substrates for ` non-theta' and GST of theta class, respectively. In two of the 12 samples no activity towards EDB was observed, which correlated with the absence of GST theta activity.

2. Materials 2.1. Materials

and methods

Glutathione was obtained from Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany. CDNB, S-hexylglutathione and EPNP were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, USA. [1,214C]EDB (0.65 GBq/mmol) was purchased from New England Corp. (Boston, MA, USA), radiochemical purity > 99%. EDB was from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI, USA). All other solvents, buffer salts and chemical reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione (DNPSG) was synthesized according to Lindwall and Boyer [27]. 2.2. Synthesis (HNPSG) of the glutathione conjugate of EPNP

The glutathione conjugate of EPNP was prepared enzymatically: 200 pmol of EPNP in 10 ml of acetone/ethanol (1:l) was added to 90 ml of 0.18 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), containing 400 pmol of glutathione, 10 mg of rat GST 3-4 and 180 pmol EDTA. The incubate was flushed for 5 min with N,, sealed and incubated for 120 min at 25"C, which resulted in > 80% turnover of EPNP as judged on analytical HPLC (see below). The

resulting mixture was lyophilized, whereafter the product was dissolved in 30 ml of 5% (v/v) acetic acid and filtered through a 5 pm filter. The product was purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC on a 250 X 21.2 mm Zorbax ODS column eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min which was equilibrated with 0.25% (v/v) TFA in H,O, followed by a linear gradient to 100% methanol in 45 min, and subsequently followed by a washing step with 100% methanol for 15 min (k' = 2.1 and 2.9, respectively for HNPSG and EPNP; injection volume of 3 ml). Fractions were collected on ice, pooled, and methanol was removed by evaporation, whereafter the remainder was lyophilized. The residue of the pooled fractions (dissolved in 5 ml of 5% (v/v) acetic acid) was loaded, again on the preparative column which has been equilibrated with 0.25% (v/v) TFA in H,O, and was now eluted isocratically for 15 min, followed by a gradient to 100% methanol in 45 min (k' = 3.7 for HNPSG). The fraction containing the conjugates was collected on ice. Methanol was evaporated and the fraction was lyophilized. The purity as judged with HPLC-analysis and NMR (see below) was > 99%. NMR analysis indicated that both diastereomers were formed in equal quantities (chiral carbon indicated in Fig. 1). ` HNMR (400 MHz, D,O/DCl, reference (trimethylsilyl)propionic acid, 6 in ppm): for the aromatic part 6 8.23 (d, 2H, J 9.4 Hz), 7.11 (d, 2H, J 9.4 Hz); for the isopropanol part 6 2.85 (m, 2H, CI&S), overlap with Cys p (H,), see below), and signals for OCE2 and OCH,CHOHCH,S overlap at 4.20 and 4.25 (m, 3H); for the glutathione part S 2.22 (m, 2H, y-Glu p ), 2.50 (m, 2H, y-Glu y), 2.95 (m, lH, Cys p (H,)), 3.08 (m, lH, Cys P (HP)), 4.00 (s, 2H, Gly a), 4.08 (t, lH, J 6.6 Hz, y-Glu (Y), and 4.59 (dt, lH, Cys a). Assignments have been confirmed by a 2D-COSY experiment. 13C-NMR (100 MHz, D,O/DCl, reference (trimethylsilyl)-propionic acid at - 1.8 ppm): for the aromatic part 6 116.04 (2C), 127.38 (2C), 142.48, and 164.99;

The product was also identified by its mass fragment m/z 503.0 using LC/MS with electrospray ionization (Finnigan MAT TSQ700). 2.3. Preparation of erythrocyte cytosol

CPM

Individual whole blood samples (10 ml) from human volunteers were collected in heparinized vials and stored on ice. The samples were diluted (1:l) with a balanced salt solution (containing 0.13 M NaCl, 14.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.41, 0.55 mM D-glucose, 0.5 mM CaCl,, 0.1 mM MgCl,, 0.54 mM KC1 and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol). Five ml of the diluted blood sample was carefully layered on 5 ml of Ficoll-paque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in a centrifuge tube, and erythrocytes were aggregated at 400 X g for 30 min (room temperature). The following steps were performed at 0-6°C. The pellet was carefully resuspended in 5 ml of the balanced salt solution, and centrifuged at 200 X g for 15 min. The erythrocytes were lysed overnight in equal amounts of H,0. The hemolysate (about 3.5 ml) was dialysed overnight against 200 ml of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) with 0.15 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. Cytosol was prepared by centrifugation for 60 min at 105 000 X g. The resulting cytosol was stored in 1 ml aliquots at -80°C. 2.4. Protein determination The protein concentratron of the cytosol was determined using the method of Bradford [28], while the protein concentration of GST PL-1 and GST 3-4 were assayed according Lowry et al. [29]. Bovine serum albumin was used as standard protein. 2.5. Enzyme purification #and assays

GST Pl-1 was purified from human placenta, and GST 3-4 from rat liver as described previously 1301. The catalytic activity of GST Pl-1 towards CDNB was determined by the method of Habig et al. [31]. 2.6. GST activity towards [1,2-` 4C]EDB The cytosol(445 ~1, n = 2) was added in an Eppendorf tube to 50 ~1 of 0.3 M GSH in 0.5 M of K,HPO, (which was adjusted to pH 6.5 with concentrated KOH). The reaction was started with 5 ~1 of 0.2 M [1,2-` 4C]EDB (specific activity [ 1,2-14 C]EDB decreased to 700 dpm/nmol; solvent DMSO/ethanol = 6:4). The capped tube was gently shaken in a waterbath for 150 min at 37°C.

These incubations were also performed in the presence of 0.5 mM S-hexyl(GSH1 (n = 1). 250 mg of (NH,),SO, was added and mixed to terminate the reaction. The protein was allowed to settle for 1 h on ice, whereafter the tube was centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 X g. The glutathione conjugates were separated by injecting 100 ~1 of the supernatant on HPLC using a Zorbax ODS column (250 X 4.6 mm; Chrompack International, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equipped with a guard column (30 X 4.6 mm; matrix Bondapak, Waters, Milford, USA) using an adapted method of Cmarik et al. [21]: The mobile phase consisted of 0.2% (v/v) TFA in H,O (solvent A) or 0.2% (v/v) TFA in acetonitrile (solvent B). The products were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 3 min with 1% B, followed by a linear gradient to 15% B in 10 min, followed by a gradient to 100% B in 5 min, and finally eluted isocratically for 6 min with 100% B. The peaks were quantified (and corrected for radioactivity in control samples with boiled cytosol) using a Flo-One Model Radioactive flow detector with Flo-ScintTM A scintillation cocktail (Packard, USA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peak area was corrected for the recovery (or efficiency of

the flow detector) of the injected dose (approximately 80%). Representative chromatograms are shown in Fig. 2. The measured mass using FAB/MS (Finnagan MAT 9000) corresponds with the calculated mass of S-(2-hydroxyethyl)GSH (m / z 351.7) for peak I and S,S' ethylenebis(GSH) (m/z 640.0) for peak II. 2.7. GST activity towards CDNB Ten ,ul of the erythrocyte cytosol (n = 2) was added in a (0.7 ml volume) HPLC-crimp vial (500 X 07-CPY; Chromacol LTD, London UK) to 445 ~1 of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) (final concentration 0.1 M and 1 mM EDTA); subsequently 25 ~1 of a 20 mM GSH solution was added, and the reaction was started with 20 ~1 of 25 mM CDNB ( in ethanol). Duplicate controls containing boiled cytosol were incubated identically. The capped vial was incubated at 25°C with the appropriate time (range 5-10 min), whereafter 50 ,ul was injected (using a Pharmacia LKB autosampler 2157) on the Zorbax column (see above), with a linear gradient of 25% of 0.2% (v/v> acetic acid in H,O to 100% of 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid in acetonitrile in 10 min (flow rate 1 ml/min). The peak areas at 340 nm were measured using a Pharmacia LKB VWM 2141 UV-detector and were integrated with Nelson Model 2600 chromatography software (Cupertino, CA, USA). Products were identified by coelution with authentic standards (k' 1.6 and 4.6, respectively : for DNPSG and CDNB, see Fig. 3a for chromatogram). A linear standard curve of DNPSG was obtained by injecting 50 ~1 of a DNPSG-containing solution in 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid (amount of DNPSG ranged from 0.078 to 5 nmol, 7 concentrations (n = 2)). DNPSG was stable ( > 24 h) in 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid at 0-6°C. 2.8. GST activity towards EPNP The GSH conjugating activity of the cytosol towards EPNP was measured in the presence of 2.5 mM Shexyl(GSH). 180 ~1 of the cytosol (n = 2) was added to 300 ~1 of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) (final concentration 0.1 M), containing 10 mM GSH, 1 mM EDTA and 2.5 mM S-hexyl(GSH) (final concentrations; a HPLC-crimp vial (see above)). Control samples containing no cytosol or boiled cytosol were treated in the same way (n = 4). The reaction was started with 20 ~1 of 12.5 mM EPNP (in ethanol). The capped vial was incubated at 25°C with the appropriate time (range lo-16 min), whereafter 7 ~1 was injected on the Zorbax column (see above), with a linear gradient of 15% of 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid in H,O to 90% of 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid in acetonitrile in 5 min, followed for 5 min with 90% of 0.2% (v/v> acetic acid in The peak areas at 315 acetonitrile (flow rate 1 ml/min). nm were measured and integrated (see above).

3. Results 3.1. GSH conjugates with [1,2-` 4CIEDB formation of erythrocytes incubated

The EDB conjugation activity of the erythrocyte cytosol was determined by incubation of cytosol (about 55 mg protein/ml) with 30 mM GSH and 2 mM [1,2-14C]EDB at pH 6.5 and 37°C. A high concentration of GSH was used, since GST-theta has a high K, towards this co-substrate [33]. Under these conditions, S,S' -ethylenebis-(GSH) is the predominantly formed G!SH conjugate of [1,2-r4C]EDB (> 80% of the radioactivity of all the metabolites; Fig. 2). The ratio S,S' -ethylenebis(GSH)/S-(2-hydroxyethyl)GSH was quite constant. The formation of S-(2-hydroxyethyl)GSH was neglected, since the amount of S-(2-hydroxyethyl)GSH was in salme cases too close to the detection limit to be integrated :reliably. This introduces a minor underestimation of the tatal rate of the GSH conjugate formation. The S,S' -ethylenebis(GSH) formation is presented in Fig. 4. The cybsol of two individuals did not possess any detectable GSH conjugating activity towards EDB. Interindividual differences in the conjugators ranged from 0.5 to 3.2 pmol min-' (mg protein)-` , with a mean of 1.76 f 0.95 (n = 10). The formation of S,S' -ethylenebis(GSH) could not be inhibited for any of the volunteers by incubating in the presence of 1 mM S-hexyl(GSH) (results not shown). This indicates that class-theta GST might be the primary class responsible for the conjugating activity.

(n = 2). The CV was less than lo%, except for volunteer P12 (17%).

3.2. Erythrocyte

GST activity towards CDNB

The pi-class GST Pl-1 is the major GST present in the human erythrocyte cytosol [34]. The GST activity in the erythrocyte was determined in a sensitive assay in which the GSH conjugate of CDNB (DNPSG) was separated by HPLC and quantified using a UV-detector. This assay is not influenced by interference with hemoglobin, as in the case with the adapted spectrophotometrical method of Habig et al. [31] by Carmagnol et al. [35]. The amount of DNPSG formed increased linearly both with increasing incubation time and with increasing cytosol concentration (results not shown). The DNPSG formation in control samples (using boiled cytosol) was similar to samples not containing any cytosol (0.3 nmol min- '1, which was less than 16% of the DNPSG formation in the presence of cytosol. The maximum consumption of CDNB was always less than 4% (with incubation time less than 10 min and 1.2 mg/ml cytosol). Every cytosol displayed CDNB conjugating activity (Fig. 5) and ranged from 1.0 to 3.5 nmol min-' (mg protein)-` . The mean GST activity towards CDNB (2.04 & 0.74 nmol min-' mg- ' (n = 12)), is similar to earlier reported values [34]. No correlation was found between the GSH conjugation activities towards [1,2- 14C]EDB and CDNB (Spearman' coefficient of rank s correlation rs = 0.36, P > 0.10). 3.3.

The specific activity of GST Pl-1 (0.33 pmol product formed mini' rng-' GST Pl-1 (kO.019; il = 3)), is comparable to a spectrophotometrically determined value 1371, while S-hexyl(GSH) (2.5 mM) indeed inhibited the GSH conjugation of EPNP by GST Pl-1 strongly (> 99%, n = 3).

4. Discussion The present study confirms the existence of a polymorphism in the GSH conjugating activity of human erythrocyte cytosol towards EDB. Evidence is presented that a polymorphism for the GST theta isoenzymes might be the primary, if not only cause for this observation. The class-theta GST was recognized by its inability to conjugate CDNB and by its lack of binding to Shexyl(GSH) affinity matrices. It is further distinguished by having a relatively high activity towards EPNP [20,38]. The GST theta family is highly conserved throughout evolution, which may imply an as yet unrecognized basal function for this family [39]. So far, the most notable feature of class-theta GST is the high dehalogenase activity [20,39,40]. The benefits of this catalysis will be dependent on the halogenated alkanes studied: some will be activated directly by GST-theta to mutagenic metabolites and some will be detoxified [13,41,42]. An absence of conjugation activity towards EDB was found in two out of 12 individuals. The reported frequency of the null-phenotype for related haloalkanes ranges from 15 to 40% [24,26,43]. Previously, the conjugator population could be divided into two subpopulations (low- and high-conjugators) for the conjugating activity of human livers towards methylene chloride [26], which might not be overlooked. Clearly, the phenotyping should be performed on a larger scale to establish whether distinct populations exist at the expression level. Recently, it has been shown that the polymorphism is due to a partial or total loss of the GSTTl gene [23], which has been determined with a PCR-based technique. The GSTTl gene was absent from 38% of the population (n = 161, which is in the range of the phenotyping results (see above). This genotyping assay will be beneficial to quickly explore the frequency distribution of larger populations. The relevance of the class-theta GST to the in vivo metabolism of EDB is of interest for the risk assessment of EDB. First of all, the question whether the generation of reactive intermediates in erythrocytes is favourable or undesired should be answered. One might argue that erythrocytes would act like a sink, absorbing the reactive interme-

ence of the pi-class (and alpha- and mu-class) GST inhibitor S-hexyl(GSH). S-hexyl(GSH) does not significantly inhibit GST of theta class [33]. Erythrocyte cytosols (about 22 mg protein/ml) were incubated in the presence of 2.5 mM S-hexyl(GSH) with 10 mM GSH and 0.5 mM EPNP at 25°C and pH 6.5. The GSH conjugate of EPNP (HNPSG) was separated by HPLC and quantified using a UV-detector (Fig. 3b). The HNPSG conjugate was identified by co-eluting with the enzymatically synthesized HNPSG conjugate. The two diastereomers (Fig. 1) were not separated using this method. The metabolite which elutes at t, 6.7 min is presumably 2-hydroxy-3-( p-nitrophenoxy)-propane as previously reported [36], because the UV-spectrum is very similar to EPNP and HNPSG (results not shown), and since this metabolite is also formed in GSH-free incubation. The amount of HNPSG formed increased linearly with both increasing incubation time and increasing cytosol or GST Pl-1 concentrations (results not shown). The HNPSG formation in control samples (with boiled cytosol) was similar to samples not containing any cytosol (0.32 nmol mini' ), which was at least 2-times less than the HNPSG formation in the presence of cytosol of conjugators (see below). The maximum consumption of EPNP was always less than 5% (with incubation time less than 16 min and 22 mg protein/ml cytosol). The cytosols from individuals P7 and PlO were distinct from the other cytosols, displaying no detectable activity (Fig. 6). For the other individuals, the conjugating activity towards EPNP ranged from 16 to 47 pmol min-' (mg protein)-` , with a mean of 28.0 & 10.6 pmol mini ' mg- '(n = 10). A significant correlation was found between the GSH conjugation activities towards [1,2-14C]EDB and EPNP (Spearman' s coefficient of rank correlation rs = 0.90, P < 0.005). Additionally the GSH activity of the cytosols towards EPNP

diate, subsequently lowering the parent compound concentration as reported for dichloromethane [44]. On the other hand, an increased generation of relatively stable reactive intermediates which might be distributed through the body does possess a potential risk [45]. Furthermore, no information is available on the relative contribution of isoenzyme(s) of the GST theta class which are catalysing this conjugation. At least two isoenzymes of class-theta GST have been described [20,46]. So far, the enzymes have been purified from liver. For the human liver, the situation differs considerably from the erythrocyte: theta-class GST represents only about 0.003% of the soluble liver protein [20], which is approximately 2-3 orders of magnitudes lower than the reported values for the alpha- and mu-class GST [47]. Since EDB conjugation is also catalysed by the human alpha GST class (specific activity about 0.1 pmol min-' (mg protein)-` , [21]), even if EDB can be ranked among the best substrates for the GST theta class (about lo-100 pm01 min-' rng--' [20]), the GST alpha class will still considerably contribute to total EDB metabolism. The toxicological implication of the GST classes obviously depends on the tissue-specific level of expression. This expression differs significantly for the alpha-, mu-, and pi-class GST, dependent on, e.g., diet and exposure to inducing xenobiotics [48]. The induction pattern of the class-theta GST has not yet been studied thoroughly. Clearly, the observed polymorphism should be taken into account. In summary, the GSH conjugation of [1,2-14C]EDB by erythrocyte cytosol has been shown to be polymorphic, due to a polymorphism for the class-theta GST. An alternative assay with a GST class theta substrate (EPNP) is also presented. This assay, which does not have need of a radioactively labelled compound, may be used to phenotype the erythrocyte cytosol.
