INTRODUCTION Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the covalent linking of amino acids and their cognate tRNAs to decode genetic information. ARSs are at the center of the question of the origin of life. Their evolution is of particular importance for understanding the evolution of translation and the transition from the RNA world to modern DNA-based forms of life.1­3 A plausible scheme for the evolution of these proteins has been proposed in which the class-defining domain is likely to be the oldest module with later inclusion of additional domains in extant ARSs. At any stage of this evolutionary process, single domains or combinations of these domains have diverged to generate extant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetaselike proteins.3,4 For this reason, the structures of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like proteins (or domains) are of great interest. EMAP II5 (endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II) and Trbp1116 (an ancient structure-specific tRNA-binding protein) are two examples of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like proteins.3 EMAP II (functional cytokine domain), the C-terminal 166 residues of its precursor (pro-EMAP II), is an anti-tumor cytokine and it can also interact with different tRNAs.5,7 It has been reported that the full-length pro-EMAP II is involved in the formation of a multi-ARS complex containing at least nine different ARSs.5,8­10 Trbp111 is the homolog of yeast Arc1p that binds methionyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetases to form a complex.6,11,12 The multi-ARS complex is associated with generation of a channel for the delivery of tRNAs and enhancing the catalytic efficiency by bringing tRNA and enzyme together.7,13

The protein PH0536 from Pyrococcus horikoshii is a putative tRNA-binding protein. It was classified into Cluster of Orthologous Groups 2263 (COGs2263), members of which are found only in archaea. An NCBI Conserved Domain Database search indicated that PH0536 contains a tRNA-binding domain, which is conserved across EMAP II, CsaA, bacterial PheRS, MetRS, etc.14 ° Here, we report the crystal structure of PH0536 at 1.7 A resolution determined by the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method. The structure shows a novel domain assembly in which a C-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold (OB-fold)15 connects with the N-terminally appended a-helix bundle. The OB-fold shares structural similarity with those of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like proteins, EMAP II5 and Trbp111.6 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning, expression, and purification

The PH0536 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET-26b(1) vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA), which was transformed into Escherichia coli strain

B834(DE3). The cells were grown in LB medium containing 25 lg/mL kanamycin at 378C and the expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at an OD600 of approximately 0.6. Five hours after addition of IPTG, the cells were harvested and disrupted using a French Press in buffer A (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 9.0). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000g, and the supernatant was incubated at 708C for 30 min and then centrifuged (30,000g, 30 min at 48C). After addition of 1.5M ammonium sulfate (AS), the supernatant was filtered (0.45 lm; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and applied to a HiTrap Phenyl HP column (Amersham Biosciences Inc., Piscataway, NJ) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5M AS). The bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of AS (1.520M, 20 CV), and the target fraction was dialyzed overnight against buffer A, and then applied to a HiTrap QXL column (Amersham Biosciences). With a linear gradient of 0 to 1.0M NaCl (25 CV), the target protein was eluted at 0.3M NaCl. The eluted fraction was loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 pg column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.3M NaCl). The protein was eluted as a single peak and the target fractions were recovered. The protein buffer was exchanged by dialysis against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and then concentrated to a final concentration of 12 mg/mL. For production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted

PH0536 (SeMet PH0536), cells were cultured in minimal medium containing SeMet. The procedure for the purification of SeMet PH0536 was the same as that used for the native protein.
Protein crystallization

The initial crystals were grown in sitting drops using a Hampton Research Screening Kit PEG/Ion (No. 63, 0.1M MES, pH 6.0, 20% PEG6000; Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Further optimization of these conditions was done using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, and good crystals grew to average dimensions of 0.2 3 0.6 3 0.1 mm3 within 2 weeks. Good crystals were obtained by mixing 2 lL of sample solution and 2 lL of reservoir solution containing 0.1M MES, pH 5.8, 18% PEG6000, 5% glycerol (w/v), and equilibrated against 1 mL of reservoir solution.
Data collection and structure determination

Before data collection, the crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing 15% glycerol for about 30 s. Se-MAD and native diffraction data sets were collected under 100 K at BL41XU of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) and NW12 of PF (Tsukuba, Japan), respectively. All data were processed using the program HKL2000,16 and the

° structure was solved with Se-MAD data at 1.7 A resolution. The positions of eight selenium atoms were determined using the program SHELXD.17 Heavy-atom parameters were refined and phases were calculated using the program SOLVE.18 The phases were improved and the initial model was built automatically to 64.7% using the program RESOLVE.19 Model building and refining were further performed semiautomatically by LAFIRE20 with the refinement program CNS21 using native data. TLS refinement for the two molecules in an asymmetric unit was carried out at the final refinement ° step by REFMAC22 at 1.7 A resolution. The stereochemistry of the structure was checked using PROCHECK.23 Atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors of PH0536 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the code 2E8G.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure

Crystals of PH0536 belong to the monoclinic space group P21, with two copies of the molecule (designated chains A and B) in the asymmetric unit. Superimposition of the two crystallographic independent chains gives a ° root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.52 A over main-chain atoms, suggesting that their conformations are identical. The final model consists of 480 residues (240 residues for one molecule) and 379 water molecules, ° which was refined at 1.7 A resolution to a working Rvalue of 19.9% and a free R-value of 23.7 (Table I). Figure 1(A) shows a monomer of the crystal structure of PH0536. It is an a1b structure composed of seven ahelices and seven b-strands, which can be divided into two domains. The N-terminal domain is a helical domain, consisting of a helices 1­6, of which a1, a2, a4, and a6 form a compact four-helix bundle with a downup-down-up arrangement of helices enclosing a hydrophobic core [Fig. 1(A)]. The a-helix bundle shows a lefthanded topology. In addition to the interactions within the four helices in the bundle, the interactions (mainly salt bridge and hydrophobic contacts) between a-helices a3­a6 and a5­a6 are involved in stabilization of the ahelical bundle. In addition, there is a bend at Asn119 in helix a6 [Fig. 1(A)], which changes the direction of the helical axis to allow it come be closer to the side of the C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain contains helix a7 and strands b1­7 forming a b-barrel domain, which is a well-known oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold (OB-fold).15 The core of the OB-fold is a five-stranded b-barrel (strands b1­3, b4, and b7), flanked by a b-hairpin (b5­b6), and helix a7 which make bilateral contacts between the core of the OB-fold and the N-terminal a-helix bundle.

The side chain of Asn119 is shown as a stick model with O atoms colored red. (B) Structural comparison of the RNA binding motif in the OB-fold of PH0536 with that of EMAP II (Pro3­Phe107), and the locations of the conserved resides in the N-terminal a-helix bundle. The main chains of PH0536 and EMAP II are colored cyan and gray, respectively. The side chains of the five resides in EMAP II, which are predicted to bind tRNA, are shown as a stick model (C, N, and O atoms are colored gray, blue, and red, respectively). The side chains of those highly conserved resides in PH0536 occupying positions close to the five residues of EMAP II are shown as a stick model with labels, and the side chains of the conserved resides in the N-terminal a-helix bundle of PH0536 are also shown as stick models, with C, N, and O atoms colored cyan, blue, and red, respectively.

Structural comparison

The C-terminal domain of PH0536 contains a typical OB-fold, which has been found in a variety of nucleic acid-binding proteins. A DALI24 search showed that the present OB-fold has the greatest structural similarity to EMAP II (PDB: 1EUJ5), an export-related chaperone (ttCsaA, PDB: 1GD725), the B2 domain of Thermus thermophilus PheRS (PDB: 1PYS26), and a structure-specific

Sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW.27 The secondary structure elements of PH0536 are illustrated as tubes for a-helices and arrows for b-strands, with N- and C-domains colored cyan and pink, respectively.

tRNA-binding protein (Trbp111, Aquifex aeolicus; PDB: ° 1PYB6), with RMSD of 2.0, 1.9, 2.0, and 2.5 A for 90, 84, 87, and 86 Ca atoms, respectively. With the exception of the B2 domain of PheRS, the specific function of which is not clear, the OB-folds of these proteins have the ability to bind tRNAs. This is in agreement with the results of an NCBI Conserved Domain Database search that indicated a tRNA-binding motif in the C-terminal region of PH0536.14 Superimposition of the OB-fold of EMAP II onto that of PH0536 is depicted in Figure 1(B). For EMAP II, tRNA-binding likely occurs through the highly conserved residues Asp24, Glu32, Thr42, Arg73, and Gln78 (side chains shown as gray stick models), located on the surface of the OB-fold.5 In the case of PH0536, the residues Glu142, Ser145, Asp153, Asn161, Phe192, Ser197, and Glu198 from strands b1­3, b6, the loop linking b1­b2, and the loops ahead/behind b6 are highly conserved among PH0536 and its homologs (Fig. 2). These residues occupy similar positions to those in EMAP II, suggesting that PH0536 binds tRNA in a similar pattern adopted by EMAP II. It is likely that the OBfold of PH0536 has the capability of binding tRNAs using these residues on the surface of the three-dimensional structure, and the close proximity of their locations can provide cooperative interactions with the incoming tRNA.

A DALI24 search for the N-terminal domain (residues 1­130) identified a few hits, most of which are capable of binding proteins. Of these structural homologs, plant invertase and pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PDB code: 1X8Z28), the vinculin binding domain of the cytoskeletal protein talin (PDB code: 1U8929), and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) invertase inhibitor (PDB code: 2CJ830) have the greatest structural similarity, with Z-scores of 8.9, 8.3, and 7.8 for 94, 107, and 85 Ca atoms, respectively. These proteins contain a four-helix bundle, except for PH0536 that has two short helices (a3 and a5) on both sides of a4, which corresponds to the third helix of four-helix bundle in the three proteins. All these helix bundles have a left-handed topology, and the helices are amphipathic, with the hydrophobic residues forming the bundle core and the hydrophilic faces being accessible to the solvent.

DISCUSSION The sequence alignment shows that the level of residue conservation of the C-terminal domain is higher than that of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2). In particular, the highly conserved residues are distributed in the OB-fold region (the b-strands and their linking loops). It is likely

506

that the OB-folds have been preserved during evolution and thus may have the major function for these proteins. With regard to the a-helix bundle in the N-terminal domain, the region Ser5­Asp64 containing the first three helices (a1­3) harbors the most conserved residues. Moreover, these conserved residues are mainly located on the inverse side of the putative tRNA-binding site (Fig. 1). It seems that these residues may not have functions associated with binding of tRNA. A structural homology search suggested that this fold prefers to bind proteins/ peptides. Given the hypothesis that PH0536 is capable of binding proteins with functions related to tRNA synthesis/transportation, as pro-EAMP II associates with the multi-ARS complex,7­9 the incoming protein and tRNA would approach PH0536 on different sides [back-lower and frontal-upper sides in Fig. 1(B), respectively]. This hypothesis requires further research and experimental verification. Based on the structural comparison, the OB-fold of PH0536 is similar to that of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like proteins EMAP II and Trbp111, although there are many nucleic acid-binding proteins that contain the OB-fold structure, including anticodon-binding tRNA synthetases, DNA helicases (RecG and RuvA), ssDNAbinding proteins (BRCA2, CDC13, telomere-end binding proteins), phage ssDNA-binding proteins (gp32, gp2.5, gpV), cold shock proteins, DNA ligases, RNA-capping enzymes, DNA replication initiators, and the RNA polymerase subunit RBP8.31,32 DALI24 search showed that there is no structural homolog for the overall structure of PH0536, indicating that the present structure is a novel assembly of the OB-fold (C-terminus) and the ahelical bundle (N-terminus). In addition to this structural analysis, further studies are underway to elucidate the function of this interesting assembly.
