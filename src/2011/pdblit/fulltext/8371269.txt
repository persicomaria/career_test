Crystallization and Crystallographic Data for New Forms of Thymidylate Synthase from Lactobacillus casei
Several new crystal forms of thymidylate synthase (5,10-methlenetetrahydrofolate : dUMP C-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.45) were obtained by controlled pH change. In the crystals the dimeric molecule has a 2-fold symmetry axis coinciding with crystallographic symmetry. The crystals scatter to at least 2.7 A resolution in the synchrotron X-ray beam and appear to be suitable for high-resolution X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystals were successfully derivatized and preliminary results are reported for the covalent inhibitory ternary complex of thymidylate synthase, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate and 5,10-methylenet'etrahydrofolate.

Thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase comprise the thymidylate synthesis cycle. This metabolic pathway is the chief route for the de-novo synthesis of thymidylate in a wide variety of organisms. Thymidylate synthase activity is usually high in rapidly proliferating cells, especially tumor cells, but hardly detectable in non-proliferating cells of dTMP production (Danenberg, 1977). Inhibition promotes a complex response in cells in which DNA synthesis is impaired in the face of continuing protein and RNA synthesis, a phenomenon termed "thymineless death" (Cohen, 1971). The enzymes of the thymidylate synthesis cycle are targets for the action of two separate groups of chemotherapeutic agents. Dihydrofolate reductase is inhibited by folate antagonists (such as amethopterin), while thymidylate synthase is the target of certain pyrimidine derivatives (such as 5fluorouracil). The antimetabolic activity of 5-fluorouracil has been traced to the interaction of its active form, 5-fluoro2'-deoxyuridylate, with thymidylate synthase and its cofactor, 5,10-CH,H,folate, to generate an inhibitory ternary complex in which the inhibitor is covalently attached to the enzyme. Various aspects of thymidylate synthase have been the subject of intensive research investigations. The biochemistry, mechanism of action and inhibition of this enzyme have been extensively reviewed by Huennekens (1968), Blakely (1969), Friedkin (1973), Danenberg (1977), Pogolotti & Santi ( 1977), Santi (1980) and Lewis & Dunlap (1981). Studies of thymidylate synthase before 1970 were frustrated by both the low levels and the apparent instability of this enzyme. However, the of amethopterin-resistant Lactodevelopment bacillus casei resulted in 100 to 400-fold amplification of thymidylate synthase levels and facilitated its isolation with recoveries of 150 mg from 150g of cells (Dunlap et al., 1971). Homogeneous preparations of thymidylate synthase have also been obtained from many other sources

including human leukemic cells (Dolniek & Cheng, 1977; Lockshin et al., 1979). However, even using the latter chromatographic methods, affinity sources provide relatively small quantities of pure enzyme. Recently, mouse cells deficient in thymidylate synthase were serially transformed with human that overproduced DNA to yield transformants human thymidylate synthase (Takeishi et al., 1984; Ayusawa et al., 1984; Shimizu et aZ., 1985). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of human thymidylate synthase with that of L. casei (Maley et al., 1979) has shown that they are highly conserved (44%) during evolution (Takeishi et al., 1985). In addition, the sequences of two other prokaryotic thymidylate syntheses, as deduced from DNA sequences from Escherichia coli (Belfort et al., 1983) and T4 phage (Chou et al., 1984), are also very similar (51 y0 and 39% homology, respectively). These comparisons suggest that the folding of thymidylate synthase molecules from different sources should be similar and that enzyme from any of these sources should serve well as models for catalytic activity. Throughout this letter, unless directly stated, we will refer to thymidylate synthase as the enzyme from L. casei. Thymidylate synthase functions as a dimer of identical subunits each comprising 316 residues; the molecular weight of the dimer calculated from the sequence is 72,786. Recent studies (as summarized by Lewis & Dunlap, 1981) suggested that the mechanism of enzyme action involves the formation of a transient covalent bond between Sy of Cys198 and C-6 of the uracil moiety. This is made possible by the increased nucleophilic character of this sulfhydryl group, which also makes this side-chain more prone to oxidation. The measured number of active site sulfhydryl groups per dimer deviates from ideal value of 2. Depending on significantly the isolation procedure and the method of measurement, this number falls into the range from 09-1.8. The presence or absence of exogenous 147

thiols is probably the most important factor in the variation of the measured number of active-site As discussed below, the sulfhydryl groups. scattering power of thymidylate synthase crystals probably depends on the oxidation state of these groups. Needle-shaped crystals of thymidylate synthase were first reported by Dunlap et al. (1971), who obtained them during enzyme purification. Their conditions were optimized by Koeppe et al. (1975), who examined the crystals by X-ray diffraction and reported two hexagonal crystal forms; one of them being a superstructure of the other (see Table 1). Since the reported crystals were only marginally useful for X-ray structure determinations, we have continued to search for conditions conducive to the growth of better crystals. Thymidylate synthase was purified from L. casei in the presence of exogenous thiol (50 mM-2mercaptoethanol) according to the method of Lyon et al. (1975). The best crystals were grown by mixing of equal volumes (5 to 50 ,ul) of freshly prepared protein solution (3% protein, 50 mMsodium citrate (pH 6.2), 1 mM-EDTA, 2 mmMgSO,, 10 mM-dithiothreitol and a buffer solution (50 mM-sodium citrate (pH 4.2), 1 mM-EDTA, 10 mM-dithiothreitol). Essentially, 2 m&r-MgSO,, supersaturation was obtained by pH change and the lowered solubility of the protein in the vicinity of its isoelectric point (pH 5.4). Final values of pH were calibrated with a pH meter in the absence of protein. Crystals of thymidylate synthase could also be obtained from older protein preparations by mixing them with the buffer solution containing 2 to 8% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. Similar results could be obtained using ammonium sulfate solutions; however, the amount of amorphous protein precipitate was much larger in the presence of ammonium sulfate than in PEG. All solutions were degassed and all operations were carried out in

a dry-box under N2. The results are summarized in Table 1. Space groups were determined from systematic absences and the symmetry of the reciprocal space. Values of unit cell volume per molecular weight unit were calculated assuming two molecules (dimers) per asymmetric unit in form I, half the dimer in forms II and III, and one and a half of the dimer in form IV. Koeppe et aZ. (1975) assumed that the number of molecules in the unit cell was higher by a factor of 2 for forms I and II, but at that time only an approximate value for the weight With our molecular was available. estimation the ratios of the volume of the unit cell to molecular weight fall into the range of 2.03 to 4.2 A3/dalton observed for crystals of proteins with molecular weights between 40,000 and 100,000 (Matthews, 1968). Four basic forms of crystals have been observed. Form I, hexagonal needles, with doubled periods a and b and probably two dimers per asymmetric unit, is less suitable for structure determination. This form was reported by Koeppe et al. (1975); it was not found in our experiments. Form II is apparently stable at a pH range of 7.2 to 5.8. Crystals of form II are hexagonal needles, and we them to were able to grow the size: 2.0 mm X O-3 mm X 0.3 mm. Crystals of form III were obtained at a lower pH range of 5.4 to 4.2 with the habit of hexagonal bipyramids bounded by (102) faces and a size up to 2.0 mm x 1.2 mm x 1.2 mm. This form has the same space group and similar a and b parameters as form II; the largest difference is in the length of period c, which is 58 to 65 A or 19 to 22% shorter depending on pH. A comparison of low-resolution {hkO} reflections did not show any similarity in the intensity distribution. Orthorhombic form IV was obtained at the same conditions as form III but from older protein preparations. This form is related to form III. When the C-centered unit cell

Letters to the Editor of orthorhombic form IV is transformed into the reduced primitive unit cell, which is monoclinic, the parameters are a = 74.6 A, b = 77.5 A, c = 243 A, y = 118.7". They correspond well with those of hexagonal form III, a = b = 78.2 8, c = 242-5 8, y = 120". The intensities of {Okl) reflections of forms III and IV on the precession photographs are almost the same, indicating that the structures are very similar. In the hexagonal lattice the ab layers are related by a 6, (or 6,) axis, and the dimer is most probably located on a 2-fold symmetry axis. Similar packing to that in form III can be obtained in the orthorhombic form IV, assuming two symmetry-independent dimers, one located on a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis and the other in a general position. This assumption led to similar packing density and solvent content in both forms, as given in Table 1. It appears, therefore, that form IV is related to form III by a deformation that shortens parameter a by 4% and distorts the y angle by 1.3". Our experiments at the X-ray synchrotron source CHESS show that the crystals of forms III and IV scatter to at least 2.7 a resolution. Crystals of thymidylate synthase are very sensitive to oxidation and easily lose completely the ability to scatter coherently with no apparent morphological changes. It is our present hypothesis that the reduced, active dimer has a 2-fold symmetry axis. When a part of the protein is oxidized, the reduced and oxidized molecules cocrystallize in an ordered way (form IV). If oxidation takes place in the crystals, it has random character, leading to crystal disorder, and concomitant loss of scattering capability. Crystals of form III were soaked in a mixture of the inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate (3.6 mM), and the cofactor, 5,10-CHzH,folate (30 mM), in the buffer at pH 5.2. Consistent with the formation of the inhibitory ternary complex (Lewis & Dunlap, 1981), the crystals became yellow, and the color persisted even after several days of washing in ligand-free buffer. A precession photograph showed a change in the c parameter from 242 A to 235 A; the latter value was noticed to be closer to the c value of 230 Bi measured for crystals of the native enzyme at pH 4.2. In addition, the observed intensities for the crystals of the reflection inhibitory ternary complex were, in general, intermediate between those found for the native crystals grown at pH 4.2 and crystals grown at pH 5.2. It is quite probable that the conformational change observed on formation of the inhibitory ternary complex (Lockshin & Danenberg, 1980) is similar t,o that observed in our crystal studies on lowering the pH of the native enzyme. To verify formation of the thymidylate synthase-5-fluoro-2'deoxyuridylate-CH,H,folate complex, we repeated our soaking experiments with tritium-labeled The results suggest that 5-fluoro-2'.deoxyuridylate. between 1.2 and 2.0 inhibitor molecules are bound per molecule of protein dimer. The uncertainty of the stoichiometry is due to the approximations used

149

to estimate the volume of the protein crystals, which, in turn, is used to calculate the amount of enzyme present in the crystals. The results obtained in the crystals are in good agreement with analogous experiments carried out in solution, which showed a binding stoichiometry of 1+Sfor the inhibitory ternary complex. More detailed kinetic analysis of binding and release of ligands will be published separately. We anticipate that the results presented here will lead to the determination of the folding of the enzyme, providing further insight into the structure and mechanism of thymidylate synthase.
