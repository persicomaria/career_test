ABSTRACT Clostridial neurotoxins are comprised of botulinum (BoNT) and tetanus (TeNT), which share significant structural and functional similarity. Crystal structures of the binding domain of TeNT complexed with disialyllactose (DiSia) and a tri-peptide Tyr-Glu-Trp (YEW) have been determined to 2.3 and 2.2 Å, respectively. Both DiSia and YEW bind in a shallow cleft region on the surface of the molecule in the -trefoil domain, interacting with a set of common residues, Asp1147, Asp1214, Asn1216, and Arg1226. DiSia and YEW binding at the same site in tetanus toxin provides a putative site that could be occupied either by a ganglioside moiety or a peptide. Soaking experiments with a mixture of YEW and DiSia show that YEW competes with DiSia, suggesting that YEW can be used to block ganglioside binding. A comparison with the TeNT binding domain in complex with small molecules, BoNT/A and /B, provides insight into the different modes of ganglioside binding. Proteins 2005;61:288 ­295.

These toxins follow multi-step mechanisms to exert their biological effects on the target nerve cells.1 BoNTs act on the peripheral nervous system, and TeNT acts on the central nervous system. TeNT is the sole causal agent for tetanus, which is characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive spasms of skeletal muscles, while BoNT is responsible for botulism, which results in flaccid paralysis and death.2 BoNT (serotypes A to G) and TeNT share significant sequence homology, as well as structural and functional characteristics. The 150-kDa inactive single chain is cleaved by tissue proteinases into an active dichain molecule with a carboxyl-terminal heavy chain of 100 kDa and an amino-terminal light chain of 50 kDa linked by a disulfide bond. The heavy chain can be further cleaved into two fragments: HN ( 50 kDa N-terminal fragment) and HC ( 50 kDa C-terminal fragment) by papain digestion. The HC fragment plays the primary role in receptor binding, while the HN is involved in translocation of the

enzymatically active light chain through the endosomal membrane into the cytosol.3­5 The X-ray crystal structures of the HC fragment of TeNT, BoNT/A, and BoNT/B show two domains within HC, N- and C-terminal domains.6 ­ 8 The N-terminal domain has a jelly-roll motif, similar to that of legume lectins, which are carbohydrate-binding proteins.9 The C-terminal half contains a -trefoil domain, which also has a common carbohydrate-binding site that is required for cell binding.6 ­ 8,10 Gangliosides consist of an oligosaccharide (either linear or branched) group linked to ceramide. The toxin­ ganglioside binding is characterized by the amino acid sequence homology among BoNTs and TeNT, which suggests that a conserved amino acid motif of the -trefoil domain may define a common carbohydrate recognition site. TeNT has been shown to specifically bind gangliosides of the G1b series, GD1b or GT1b.11­13 To understand the ganglioside­toxin association, various experimental strategies like binding, mutagenesis, photoaffinity, X-ray studies, and computational docking have been undertaken.3,7,8,10,11,14 ­20 These studies identify binding regions, binding mechanisms, affinity, and preferred sugar moieties for optimum binding. Binding studies of TeNT with gangliosides show the importance of the presence of the disialic acid moiety and also the Gal (1,3)GalNAc disaccharide moiety for the tight binding.13,21 Mutagenesis studies suggest that the C-terminal residues 1306 ­1310 are essential for cell and ganglioside binding, and photoaffinity studies show that the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acids of TeNT (residues 1282­1315) are sufficient to support the binding of gangliosides that have the NeuAc (2,8)NeuAc moiety.3,17 Recent analysis of mutants of TeNT show that His1271­Asp1282, Asp1214 ­Asn1219, and the region around Tyr1290 provide key residues for ganglioside binding.16,22 The X-ray crystal structures of TeNT with lactose, galactose, GalNAc, sialic acid, and GT1b analog show the

presence of four different sites on the surface of TeNT, which are spaced at least 10 Å from each other.10,11 The results show that there are two distinct binding sites for GT1b in TeNT. Docking, ESI-MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies show that these binding regions can also bind other small molecules and peptides; new binding sites that are near the known and putative binding sites also have been identified.20 The tri-peptide Tyr-Glu-Trp (YEW) was identified as one of the molecules that bind to a new site that is close to the gangliosidebinding site. We are interested in X-ray studies with ganglioside and non-ganglioside molecules such as peptides to explore whether they bind in the existing sites or new sites. As no efficient drug therapy is yet available for tetanus or botulinum, the study to identify suitable inhibitors to block ganglioside binding could lead to structurebased drug design for these toxins. We have determined the crystal structures of TeNT with DiSialyllactose (DiSia), a ganglioside (GD3) sugar moiety, and a tri-peptide Tyr-Glu-Trp (YEW) to gain insight into designing effective inhibitors with improved specificity and affinity for TeNT. These complexes reveal that both DiSia and YEW bind to TeNT in the same shallow region on the surface of the molecule at the -trefoil domain. A comparison with other TeNT complexes, BoNT/A and /B, is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS TeNT­DiSia and TeNT­YEW Complexes The recombinant tetanus toxin C fragment, which constitutes the binding portion of the tetanus neurotoxin, was purchased from Roche Diagnostics Corp. (Indianapolis, IN). The lyophilizate was salt-free and contained no protein carrier. The purity of the protein sample was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The protein was prepared as described elsewhere.23 The protein was reconstituted with 100 mM NaHCO3 at pH 7.8 to a protein concentration of 7­10 mg/mL. The solution was dialyzed against 100 mM NaHCO3 at pH 7.8 for 24 h in two steps at 4°C. The buffer in the protein solution was then exchanged by dialysis to 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 for 24 h, again in two steps. The protein was then concentrated to 8 mg/mL. Crystallization was carried out by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. One microliter of protein solution was mixed with 1­3 L of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 700 L of the same reservoir solution. The reservoir solution consisted of 15% PEG4000, 100 mM imidazole, and 50 mM NaCl or MgCl2. Soaking experiments with various concentrations of disialyllactose and duration of soaking ranging from 12 to 48 h were carried out, and X-ray diffraction data were collected. The optimum concentration and soaking time were identified as 25 mM and 36 h, respectively. Data were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature at beam line X12C of the NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory with a Brandeis CCD based B4 detector. An oscillation range of 1° was used for each data frame, with a crystal-to-detector distance of 100 mm and 1.01 Å. Data were processed by HKL200024 (Table I).

Since the cell dimensions were slightly different from the native structure, the molecular replacement method was used to solve the structure of the TeNT­DiSia complex.25 The crystal structure of the binding domain of TeNT was used as the search model.6 After initial rigid body refinement, the structure was refined with CNS, and the model was examined with O.26,27 A sigma-weighted Fo-Fc map was calculated with refined models. The initial map showed interpretable electron density for the two sialic acid and Gal residues. The coordinates for Sia and Gal residues were taken from the Protein Data Bank (code: 1F31). The sialic acid and Gal molecules were fitted into the density and refined. Subsequent refinements showed density for the Glc also. O was used to build the sugar molecule into the electron density. A similar procedure was followed for the TeNT­YEW, complex except that the crystals were soaked for 48 h in the mother liquor containing 37 mM YEW. Since the cell dimensions are similar to the native structure, 1AF9 was used as the starting model, followed by rigid-body and simulated annealing refinements. Electron density for all three peptide residues except for the side-chain atoms of Glu could be seen in the initial map. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of DiSia ( Neu5Ac(2,8) Neu5Ac(2,3) DGal(1,4)DGlc), and Figure 2(a and b) shows the refined structures superposed on 2Fo-Fc omit maps. In both structures, the density for the loop region 940 ­948 is weak and may be disordered. Coordinates have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank, 1YYN (TeNT­DiSia) and 1YXW (TeNT­YEW). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The structures of the TeNT­DiSia and TeNT­YEW complexes were determined at 2.3 and 2.2 Å, respectively.

molecule binding to BoNT, unlike in TeNT. The Sia binding site of TeNT is structurally and sequentially dissimilar to that of BoNT/B, and this brings out the differences in the toxin­ ganglioside interactions between BoNT/B and TeNT. Although a moiety of the ganglioside binds BoNT/B at Site 1, no structural information is available about the interaction of any other GT1b moiety with the neurotoxin. Comparison with GT1b Complex DiSia (the GD3 sugar moiety) forms one branch of GT1b oligosaccharide {Neu5Ac (2,3)Gal (1,3) GalNAc (1,4) [Neu5Ac (2,8)Neu5Ac (2,3)] Gal (1,4)Glc (1,1); the DiSia portion of GT1b is italicized and underlined}. In the GT1b­analog complex, Gal and GalNAc interact with one TeNT molecule (around residues Tyr1290 and His1271), and the two Sia residues interact with a symmetry-related molecule (around residues Asp1147 and Arg1226); accordingly, GT1b acts as a cross-linker for the protein.10 A comparison of the GT1b complex with the DiSia complex shows the following three differences: 1. The interactions of Sia7 OA1 (Sia2 in DiSia complex) with Asn1216 OD1 (5.3 Å separated in the DiSia complex) and of Sia6 O10 (Sia1 in DiSia complex) with Asn1216 OD1 (4.7 Å separated in the DiSia complex) observed in the GT1b complex are absent in DiSia complex. 2. The conformation of the Sia2 carboxyl group at the (2,3) linkage between Sia2 and Gal3 is equatorial in the GT1b analog complex and axial in the DiSia complex. GT1b used in the GT1b complex is a synthetic compound. The difference between synthetic and wild-type GT1b is that the Sia6 ­Gal2 linkage is in wild type and in synthetic. This explains the difference in sugar linkage conformation. As there is no interaction with the carboxyl group, this conformational change does not affect the binding. The closest distance between OA1 of the carboxyl group of Sia2 and Glu1147 OD2 is 4.8 Å in DiSia complex, and closest distance between OA1 of the carboxyl group and Lys1143NZ is 6.6 Å in the GT1b complex. There is enough space around the carboxyl group of Sia6 for any desired conformation. There are no steric clashes. 3. Since the (2,3) linkage between Sia2 and Gal3 is different from its corresponding linkage at the GT1b analog, the Gal and Glc of DiSia coincide with GalNAc and Gal (instead of Gal and Glc) of the GT1b analog. Except for these three differences, the overall binding interactions of Sia1 and Sia2 are similar to the head group of GT1b sugars. These differences suggest that DiSia might represent the true interactions between GT1b and the protein, rather than the GT1b analog. Although the glycerol groups of Sia1 and Sia2 are more flexible, they have the same interactions and conformation in both the GT1b and DiSia complexes. The interactions of the sialic

The overall structure of TeNT is well-ordered and has 441 residues from 875 to 1315, a region that is similar to that of the native structure.6 The geometry of the models is reliable, with 82% (TeNT­DiSia) and 83% (TeNT­YEW) of the residues in the most favored region, and the rest in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot as defined by PROCHECK.28 TeNT­DiSia Complex The observed binding interactions between DiSia and TeNT are shown in Figure 3(a), and possible hydrogenbond interactions are listed in Table II. The binding site is in a shallow cleft region on the surface of the molecule formed by four loops, Asp1214 ­Ala1217 and Gln1274 ­ Asn1280 on one side, and Asn1141­Asp1147 and Tyr1229 ­Ala1235 on the other [Fig. 1(a), ref. 6]. The two Sia residues interact extensively with the enzyme, while Gal and Glc residues are solvent exposed. Sia1 makes direct hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp1147, Asn1216, and Arg1226, and Sia2 is stabilized by interactions with Asp1214, Asn1216, Arg1226, and Tyr1229 (Table II). Recent site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the mutation of key residues Asp1214 ­Asn1219 resulted in substantially reduced ganglioside binding.22 One of the interactions, the salt bridge observed in TeNT between the guanidino group of Arg1226 and the carboxylate oxygens (O1A and O1B) of sialic acid (Sia2) (Table II) is conserved in GT1b and Sia complexes and is characteristic of TeNT­ ganglioside recognition.10,11 Gal3 and Glc4 do not form any hydrogen bonds with the protein. These are solvent exposed and are stabilized by intra-molecular hydrogen bonds with bound Sia2. O4 of Gal3 forms three intramolecular hydrogen bonds with O6 and O9 of Sia2 and O4 of Glc4. The shortest distance between Glc-O6 and Arg1168 of the symmetry-related molecule is 4.9 Å. Although GT1b binds to BoNTs and TeNT, their modes of binding are different. In TeNT, there are two sites (Fig. 4) where two independent GT1b molecules bind.15 One of the sites (Site 1, variantly called the lactose-binding site of TeNT or the sialic-acid binding site of BoNT) seems to be common to both. However, the mode of interaction is different. While lactose interacts with the protein at this site in TeNT, sialic acid interacts with the protein in BoNT. This has also been confirmed by mutational studies.29 BoNT/B binds sialic acid in a cleft (Site 1, Fig. 4) between residues His1240 and Trp1261.8 In TeNT, lactose interacts with residues at this site. Site 2, called the sialic-acid binding site of TeNT, is structurally present in BoNT but does not bind any part of GT1b in BoNT. This results in only one GT1b

Comparison with Sia Complex and Native Structure Comparison of the TeNT­Sia complex (PDB code 1DFQ) with the TeNT­DiSia complex shows that the two Sia residues of DiSia complex bind in the same region with the same set of residues: Asp1147, Asp1214, Asn1216, and Arg1226; however, the two residues are positioned on either side of the Sia position in the Sia complex. The interactions between Sia, Asp1214, and Asp1147 are water mediated in the Sia complex, and the waters are replaced by O4 and O10 of Sia1, and O1A and O1B of Sia2 in the DiSia complex. It is interesting to note that TeNT binds a mono- or disialic acid in the same region with the same set of residues. A comparison of this complex to the native structure in the binding region shows two minor changes.6 The first difference is that the side chain of Asn1216 rotates by about 60° in 2 to facilitate formation of a hydrogen bond with O10 of Sia2. The other difference is that the gua-

acid carboxylate and glycerol groups with the protein have been found to be specificity determinants and conserved in the present complex.30

nidino group of the Arg1226 side chain rotates 90° in 4 to interact with the carboxyl group of Sia2. There are no other significant movements in the binding region. The overall comparison shows that the regions of 940 ­948 and 1274 ­1278 differ slightly between the native and this complex. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) for all C atoms excluding these regions is 0.57 Å, while the RMSD for these two regions alone is 0.85 Å. Neither of the regions is close to the binding site nor likely to influence the binding interactions. Although circular dichroism (CD) studies with the BoNT/A­GT1b complex suggest conformational change upon GT1b binding, we do not find any major change in the helix content of TeNT, in agreement with other structural work.8,10,31 TeNT­YEW Complex The tri-peptide YEW binds TeNT in the same site as DiSia and provides an example of a non-ganglioside molecule binding to a ganglioside-binding site. This result shows that this site can bind either sugars or peptides. The difference electron density could unambiguously be interpreted as density representing YEW, although the density for the side chain of Glu was initially absent. The YEW interactions with TeNT are shown in Figure 3(b), and possible hydrogen bonds are listed in Table III. The observed interactions between tri-peptide and protein residues indicate that the tri-peptide is bound in a fashion similar to that of DiSia. The N-terminal amino group of YEW forms hydrogen bonds with Asn1230 and Ala1231 through water molecules, whereas the C-terminal Trp side chain fits well in the pocket formed by residues Lys1143, Asp1147, Tyr1148, and Asp1278. The middle residue Glu of YEW interacts with Asn1216, Ile1224, and Arg1226.

Modeling suggests that an even bulkier amino acid residue could be accommodated to improve interactions with the protein. The tri-peptide-bound region shows that there is enough room for the peptide to extend on the N-terminal side also. So a tetra- or penta-peptide could also bind in this region. The side chains of YEW form a number of van der Waals contacts with the protein to further stabilize the complex. Comparison of the DiSia and the YEW complex shows that Asp1147, Asp1214, Asn1216, and Arg1226 are the common residues involved in binding YEW and DiSia in both complexes. The observed interactions in the two complexes are slightly different but comparable and provide a unique stabilizing effect in this region. These residues are involved in Sia and GalNAc binding also.11 Asp1147, Asp1214, and Arg1226 play key role in stabilizing any bound receptor in this region. Deletion or mutation of these key residues to Ala or Ser significantly reduces the binding activity of this site.16,22 As both YEW and DiSia bind at the same site, soaking experiments with a mixture of YEW and DiSia in equimolar concentrations were conducted, and the results show that YEW competes with DiSia and binds at the site, as confirmed by the crystal structures (data not shown). However, in general the average thermal factor for YEW was found to be higher than when the crystal was soaked with YEW alone, indicating a spatial disorder. This suggests that YEW can be used as an inhibitor to block the binding of ganglioside GT1b at least on one site. Water molecules play an important role in stabilizing the peptide in the region. Similarly, when Sia and GalNAc bind in this region, water plays an important role.11 Interestingly, when DiSia binds, all water molecules are displaced. The water molecule Wat1 mimics O10 of Sia2 (1.1 Å away from Wat1) and forms similar hydrogen bonds with YEW in the binding site. Water molecules are buried in the molecule and have low temperature factors, showing their stability. This structure is consistent with an earlier ESI-MS study.20

Comparison of TeNT with BoNT/A and BoNT/B The sequence and structure of the -trefoil domains of TeNT, BoNT/A, and /B were compared in the different binding sites of TeNT to characterize this site in BoNT/A and /B. Figure 5(a) shows the superposition of the C atoms of BoNT/A (red) and BoNT/B (green) with TeNT (blue). The alignment is structure based, and the loop regions were not included in the alignment.27 Although there are sequence alignments in the loop region, they were not considered for superposition, as the loop orientations differ. The RMSD between TeNT and BoNT/A is 0.9 Å, and between TeNT and BoNT/B it is 0.7 Å for 52 C positions. The sequence alignment of TeNT with BoNT/A and /B in the -trefoil region by CLUSTALW program is shown in Figure 5(b).32 Site 1 While TeNT binds lactose and part of GT1b (Gal­ GalNAc), BoNT/B binds Sia and doxorubicin in this region. In BoNT/B, doxorubicin competes with GT1b for binding.19 This suggests that in BoNT/B, the sialyllactose binding site will be that of GT1b. This site is conserved both sequentially and structurally and has been predicted by various biochemical studies to be involved in ganglioside binding. The conserved Tyr1290 of TeNT (Tyr1266 in BoNT/A and Tyr1262 in BoNT/B) plays a key role in ganglioside binding.16 Also His1293 of TeNT has been implicated in ganglioside binding.3 Gln1269 in BoNT/A and Glu1265 in BoNT/B can play a similar role to His1293 in TeNT with a similar stacking of the side chain of Trp1289, which is used to maintain the binding pocket in its proper shape for the binding. In addition, it has been shown that ganglioside quenches tryptophan fluorescence, suggesting that Trp1265 must be part of the ganglioside binding site in BoNT/A.33 Trp1261 takes on this role in BoNT/B, contributing to the binding of Sia in this region. As BoNT/A has the same sequence and structural motif, it is also expected to bind ganglioside in this region. However, in all of these structures this tryptophan provides only stacking interactions. This site is conserved and represents the general binding pocket of clostridial neurotoxins. By identifying suitable ligands for this site, they can be used as inhibitors for the entire family of clostridial neurotoxins. Although this site is common to both BoNTs and TeNT, its interaction with sugars is different.29 While sialic acid interacts with the protein in BoNT, lactose interacts with it in TeNT. Mutation studies have demonstrated that the mutation of Tyr1290 (or the corresponding residue in BoNTs) affects the toxicity of TeNT and BoNTs differently. Tyr1262 makes two strong hydrogen bonds in BoNT/B, while corresponding interactions are absent in TeNT. Site 2 This site in TeNT binds Sia, Lac, DiSia (GD3), YEW, and the Gal-NAc part of GT1b. This region is mainly formed by loops (loop1: residues 1141­1147; loop2: residues1229 ­ 1235; loop3: residues 1274 ­1280; loop4: residues 1214 ­ 1217). The lengths and orientations of three of the four

loops forming the binding site are different. Loop1 is close to the binding site in TeNT, about 7 Å away in BoNT/B, and absent in BoNT/A. This loop is shorter in TeNT (7 residues long) and longer in BoNT/B (10 residues long). Loop2 in BoNT/A and /B is oriented about 90° from the corresponding TeNT loop. Loop3 is the same length in TeNT, BoNT/A, and /B but has different orientations. The key residues Asp1147, Asp1214, Asn1216, and Tyr1229 that interact with bound ligands in TeNT are on loop regions and are not conserved in BoNT/A and /B, though BoNT/A and /B show some conservation between them (Glu1202 and Leu1205 in BoNT/A correspond to Glu1188 and Leu1192 in BoNT/B, respectively) [Fig. 5(a and b)]. This is a unique binding site for TeNT and differs structurally and sequentially from BoNT/A and /B, which is probably the reason it does not act as a binding site for BoNT/A or /B. Bavari et al. have shown that two peptides (corresponding to aa 1157­1181 and aa 1230 ­1253 of TeNT) induce massive protective immunity against BoNTs.34 It is interesting to see that the tri-peptide YEW interacts with residues in this region and accordingly YEW may be a part of the antibody. Also, it has been suggested that in the double-receptor model, this site occupied by ganglioside may later be displaced by the second receptor, a glycoprotein15 and may provide the necessary protein­protein interaction. A peptide binding in this region also suggests that this may be a common site for sugars and peptides. Since DiSia is the sugar group of GD3, it is possible that TeNT may bind to GD3 but BoNTs will not. CONCLUSIONS The results show that both DiSia and YEW bind in the same region and YEW competes with DiSia and can be used as an inhibitor for the binding site. DiSia binding characterizes ganglioside binding to TeNT and could be the binding site for GD3, and YEW binding shows that this binding site of TeNT is unique. Comparison studies show that although TeNT has two binding sites, Site 2 is a unique binding site for TeNT, and Site 1 is a common site for all clostridial neurotoxins. The inhibitors of the conserved site remain the most practical target. As TeNT has multiple binding sites, if ligands that simultaneously bind to two adjacent sites can be identified, they can be used to develop bidendate reagents for TeNT.
