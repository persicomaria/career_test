The Gag and Gag/Pol polyproteins, in particular, are cleaved by a viral protease, which is itself contained within the Gag/Pol polyprotein chain. Since the demonstration that the human immunodeficiency virus protease (HIV Pr) is essential in the viral life cycle [1­3], this enzyme has become one of the primary targets for antiviral drug design. This has led to the development of many active-site inhibitors, some of which are currently in use as therapeutic agents for AIDS treatment [4]. In order to be proteolytically active, two protease monomers must assemble into a homodimer, with each subunit contributing residues to the substrate binding pocket, including residue Asp-25, which is directly involved in the catalysis [5]. The requirement for protease dimerization to achieve proteolytic activity has led several authors to propose alternative noncompetitive inhibitors that would provoke the dissociation of the active homodimeric assembly [6­8]. With the objective of probing the structural stability of HIV Pr and the eventual design of potential inhibitors of the enzyme that are directed to regions other than the active site, we have examined the effects of antiHIV-1 Pr monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the catalytic activity of the protease [9, 10]. We have recently reported a preliminary study of mAb1696, which, although raised against the HIV-1 Pr, inhibits the catalytic activity of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enzymes with inhibition constants of 0.6 nM and 1.5 nM, respectively, at pH 7.4 [11]. This study also showed that mAb1696 cross-reacts with peptides containing the N terminus of the HIV protease. The N-terminal region accounts for a large percentage of the interface between the two HIV Pr monomers because it interdigitates with the C-terminal segment from the other monomer, thus forming a 4-stranded intermolecular -pleated sheet in the active homodimer. We proposed that mAb1696 inhibits HIV Pr by perturbing the native structure of the enzyme at the dimer interface [11]. In addition, a clustering of negatively charged residues at the antigen binding site was observed in the unliganded Fab crystal structure, which suggested that electrostatic forces play an important role in the interaction between mAb1696 and HIV Pr. To investigate further the mechanism of HIV Pr inhibition by mAb1696, we have now expressed a singlechain Fv fragment (scFv) in E. coli, which contains both 1696 variable domains joined by a flexible linking peptide. Such scFv constructs, which retain the full antigen binding capacities, are the object of very active research. Firstly, they are of interest for structural studies because they usually yield crystals diffracting to higher resolution than the corresponding Fab fragments on

Summary Background: Since the demonstration that the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV Pr) is essential in the viral life cycle, this enzyme has become one of the primary targets for antiviral drug design. The murine monoclonal antibody 1696 (mAb1696), produced by immunization with the HIV-1 protease, inhibits the catalytic activity of the enzyme of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range. The antibody cross-reacts with peptides that include the N terminus of the enzyme, a region that is highly conserved in sequence among different viral strains and that, furthermore, is crucial for homodimerization to the active enzymatic form. ° Results: We report here the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of a recombinant single-chain Fv fragment of mAb1696 as a complex with a cross-reactive peptide of the HIV-1 protease. The antibody-antigen interactions observed in this complex provide a structural basis for understanding the origin of the broad reactivity of mAb1696 for the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases and their respective N-terminal peptides. Conclusion: A possible mechanism of HIV-protease inhibition by mAb1696 is proposed that could help the design of inhibitors aimed at binding inactive monomeric species.

account of their smaller size and decreased interdomain flexibility. Secondly, since they are expressed in bacteria, they are also well suited for binding, mutagenesis and protein engineering studies [12]. In this paper, we ° report the three-dimensional structure at 2.70 A resolution of a complex formed between scFv1696 and peptide PQITLWQRR, whose sequence derives from the N terminus of the HIV-1 Pr. (The additional arginine residue was added to the C terminus to increase solubility.) The structure of the complexed scFv1696 is compared with the free Fab1696 structure reported earlier [11]. On the basis of the interactions seen in the complex, the crossreactivity between mAb1696 and the HIV-1 and HIV-2 protease and their N-terminal peptides can be explained. In addition, a mechanism of HIV Pr inhibition by mAb1696 is proposed that may help the design of alternative HIV protease inhibitors, aimed at dissociating the homodimeric viral enzyme. Results and Discussion Inhibition of HIV-1 Pr and HIV-2 Pr by scFv1696 The recombinant single-chain fragment scFv1696 was found to have essentially the same inhibitory capacities as those previously found for Fab1696 or for the complete antibody molecule [11]. Inhibition kinetics of the protease in the presence of scFv1696 were measured by

following the rate of substrate cleavage using reversephase HPLC (see Experimental Procedures). The kinetic data were used to estimate the initial reaction velocities of HIV-1 Pr and HIV-2 Pr for each concentration of inhibiting scFv1696. These were normalized to the initial reaction velocity in the absence of inhibitor and were plotted as a function of scFv1696 concentration (Figure 1). Inhibition constants were evaluated by fitting the following equation, which describes the tight binding inhibition model [13], to the experimental points of the graph: vi /v0 1 {[E] Kinh)

The inhibition constants, Kinh, thus obtained for the scFv1696 were 0.6 nM for HIV-1 Pr and 5.5 nM for HIV-2 Pr. The inhibition curves can also be used to obtain the concentration of scFv1696 equivalent to the total amount of active sites present in the reaction mixture. Thus, the calculated stoichiometry of the complexes are 0.9:1 for the scFv1696/HIV-1 Pr and 1.0:1 for the

scFv1696/HIV-2 Pr complex, which agree with values found previously for Fab1696 and IgG1696 [11]. Quality of the Model and Overall Structure Refinement statistics from the scFv1696-peptide crystal structure are given in Table 1. The final model includes 113 residues for the light chain and 120 residues for the heavy chain for each of the two scFv1696 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The two crystallographically independent complexes were tightly restrained during refinement by imposing the noncrystallographic symmetry relating them (see Experimental Procedures). All residues from the model fall into favorable or allowed regions of the Ramachandran energy space, with the exception of Ala-51L, since this residue forms a turn [14], which is characteristic of the unique canonical conformation of CDR-L2. Residues belonging to the hypervariable loops were well defined in the electron density map, and the bound peptide could be unambiguously traced for six of its nine residues from Pro-P1 to Trp-P6 in both complexes present in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2). Although some weak density is visible for main chain atoms of Gln-P7, this residue is not included in our current model. Other missing residues from our model belong to the flexible (Gly4Ser)3 linker, which connects the C terminus of the light chain to the N terminus of the heavy chain. A total of 53 well-defined water molecules have been placed using difference maps. Of these, 32 are conserved between the two molecules. Peptide-Antibody Interactions In the scFv1696-peptide complex, the antigenic peptide adopts an extended conformation in a shallow groove that runs across the antigen binding site. This binding groove is partially closed at the N-terminal end of the

peptide but is more open to the solvent at its C terminus, where the peptide, although not visible in this region, presumably extends out from the antigen binding site. The total molecular surface area buried upon complex ° formation is 498 A2 for the peptide (representing 72% of its total accessible surface area of the six N-terminal ° residues) and 443 A2 for the antibody. Overall, the interaction is reminiscent of that seen in MHC-peptide complexes, with a few residues from the antigen being buried in specificity pockets, serving as anchor residues, and others pointing toward the solvent, making only a few or no contacts [15]. The antigenic peptide interacts primarily with the heavy chain of the antibody. This is reflected in the buried surface area per CDR upon complex formation, where that from the heavy chain accounts for 70% of the total buried surface. The hypervariable loops CDRH1 and CDR-H2 of the antibody establish the largest number of van der Waals contacts (Figure 3) and account for eight of the nine hydrogen bonds seen in the complex (Table 2). As seen in other antibody-peptide complexes, hypervariable region CDR-L2 does not contact the antigen [16]. With the exception of peptide residue Thr-P4, whose side chain points toward the exterior of the antigen binding groove and does not make any contact with the antibody, the remaining ordered residues from the peptide establish several contacts. The most extensive polar interactions are made by Gln-P2, which is buried in a pocket formed by residues protruding from CDR-H1 and CDR-H2, losing 76% of its solventaccessible surface upon binding. As confirmed by the low temperature factors for its main and side chain atoms, this residue is well stabilized by several polar interactions with the antibody (Table 2). Two other residues, Pro-P1 and Trp-P6, lose 68% and 81%, respectively, of accessible surface area upon complex formation. Pro-P1 and Trp-P6 are buried in pockets formed by acidic residues Asp-H31 and Asp-H98, respectively, and by hydrophobic residues Phe-L94 and Tyr-H47, respectively. The formation of a hydrogen bond between the secondary amino group of the N-terminal Pro-P1 and the carbonyl group of Asp-H31 is consistent with our observation that mAb1696 recognizes the mature processed form of HIV-1 Pr, but not a precursor form containing 20 amino acids upstream from the cleavage site. In the latter unprocessed form, the main chain secondary amide group of the proline residue is not capable of hydrogen bond formation. Furthermore, the presence of a partially closed pocket containing negatively charged residues could neutralize the positive charge of the N terminus of the peptide or the mature protease. Toward its C-terminal end, by contrast, recognition does not seem to be restricted by the length of the peptide, as shown by the broad reactivity between scFv1696 and longer peptides like P1­P13 or the entire protease. The rather small number of well-ordered peptide residues in the binding groove compared with other antibodypeptide complexes is probably compensated by the large percentage of buried surface area upon complex formation. Furthermore, the large hydrophobic interaction could offset a high entropic cost due to the high mobility of the peptide in solution [17].

Comparison between the Complexed scFv1696 and the Free Fab1696 Structures To evaluate the contribution of conformational changes within the antigen binding site upon formation of the antibody-peptide complex, the scFv1696-peptide complex was compared with the variable dimer of the nonliganded Fab1696 structure [11]. The crystallographic asymmetric unit of the scFv1696 complex contains two molecules that have been tightly restrained by the noncrystallographic symmetry relating them. Therefore, only one molecule of scFv1696 is used here for comparison. The overall rms difference in the -carbon positions ° of the variable dimers is 1.04 A after superposition. Part of this deviation is due to a difference in the relative orientation between the VH and VL domains of the complexed and nonliganded states of 1696. Thus, after superimposing the VL domains of the two forms, the VH domain of the free 1696 variable dimer required an addi° tional 4.3 rotation about its centroid (and a 0.2 A translation) to give optimum superposition onto VH of the com-

plexed form. Superimposing the VH and VL domains individually gives an rms difference in -carbon posi° ° tions of 1.20 A and 0.51 A, respectively. These differences result mainly from the adaptation of the CDRs to the antigen upon complex formation (see Figure 4). The most conspicuous differences occur within CDR-H3, which undergoes a large conformational change upon complex formation. When CDR-H3 is excluded from the ° same pairwise comparison, the rmsd is 0.49 A. Indeed, all -carbon atoms of the segment comprising residues ° Arg-H96­Glu-100A move by more than 2.0 A between their antigen-bound and free states, with the -carbon ° of Tyr-H99 deviating by 7.0 A (Figure 4). Two of these residues, His-H97 and Asp-H98, establish direct van der Waals contacts with Pro-P1 from the antigenic peptide (Figure 3). This large conformational change thus results in the formation of a binding site with significantly different topology from that of the free Fab1696 (Figures 4 and 5). Hence, the recognition of the antigenic HIV-1 Pr peptide by mAb1696 provides a clear example of an

sponding atoms from the HIV-1 Pr with an overall rmsd ° of 1.8 A (Figure 6). Nevertheless, the detailed conformation of the segment P1­P6 is different in the two structures. In particular, the orientations of the side chains of the N- and C-terminal residues bear no similarity to those in the corresponding segment in the protease. Cross-Reactivity with HIV-2 Pr N-Terminal Peptide PQFSLWKR Although mAb1696 was obtained by immunization with the entire HIV-1 Pr, it is nevertheless able to cross-react with HIV-2 Pr with a 3-fold increase in affinity [11]. In addition, peptides containing the N-terminal region of HIV-1 Pr, such as P1­P7 or P1­P13, are able to effectively compete with the protease in binding to the antibody. Even though we have not succeeded so far in crystallizing the complex formed between mAb1696 and the protease, it is of interest nevertheless to interpret the cross-reactivity in light of our current crystal structure. In the crystal structure of the scFv1696-HIV-1 Pr peptide complex, several residues of the antigenic peptide are deeply buried in complementary pockets formed by antibody residues. This would impose constraints on sequence variability at these positions in order for antigen recognition to be maintained. The cross-reactivity of 1696 with the HIV-2 Pr peptide thus probably stems from the invariance between the two isolates of the four residues situated at positions P1, P2, P5, and P6 of the protease sequence and the conservative substitutions Ile-P3  Phe and Thr-P4  Ser, all of which lose more than 60% of their accessible surface area upon complex formation. The substitution Gln-P7  Lys and further substitutions beyond position 7 would probably not affect the interaction, although they could affect the unbound conformation of the antigen. Other amino acid substitutions at position 4 should be tolerated since the

induced fit mechanism for antibody-antigen recognition. Other examples include the recognition of a hemagglutinin peptide by antibody 17/9 [18] and the peptide 36­46 from the HIV-1 Pr [10], where large conformational changes in CDR-H3 are also associated with peptide binding. Of note, the presence of glycine at position 100 in CDR-H3 of mAb1696 (as with Gly-H100B in mAb 17/9 and Gly-H100C in mAb F11.2.32) allows for a larger flexibility of this hypervariable loop. Conformation of Peptide The six well-ordered residues from the antigenic peptide adopt a rather extended structure, with several of its backbone torsion angles (residues P2, P3, P4) lying in the region of Ramachandran space. In contrast to several other peptide-antibody complexes, where the peptide ligand adopts a more compact conformation such as turns [17], the HIV-1 Pr peptide has no intramolecular interactions that would stabilize the observed conformation in solution. The conformation adopted by the bound peptide is roughly similar to that seen in the native protease, since the 20 main chain atoms of residues P1­P6 can be superimposed with the corre-

side chain of this residue does not make direct contacts with the antibody. The substitution Ile-P3  Phe retains the hydrophobic character but must accommodate a slightly larger side chain volume; the phenyl ring could, however, provide favorable aromatic stacking interactions with Trp-H50. It is not clear from the crystal structure why mAb1696 suffers a loss of affinity toward HIV-2 Pr at lower pH while that for HIV-1 is maintained [11], since the disordered residue P7 (Gln  Lys) cannot be in close contact with any acidic residue of the antigen binding site. The different behavior as a function of pH could arise from the difference in isoelectric points (theoretical values obtained from the ExPASy server are 8.8 and 5.3 for HIV-1 Pr and HIV-2 Pr, respectively) and/or a difference in pH dependence of the dimerization constant [19]. Mechanism of Inhibition In our previous report, we showed, by using size-exclusion chromatography, that mAb1696 was able to form

specific molecular complexes with both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases [11]. In addition, the stoichiometry of the complex was evaluated as one protease monomer per 1696 binding site. Since the structural similarity between the bound antigenic peptide and the corresponding segment of the native protease is only approximate (Figure 6), it is not possible to make an unequivocal proposition for docking the protease itself onto the antigen binding site of scFv1696. Nevertheless, it is interesting to use the orientation taken by the peptide within the antigen binding site to generate possible models for the HIV-protease in complex with the antibody. These models show that binding of the segment 1­6 by mAb 1696 is not possible in the active homodimer, mainly because of steric hindrance with the adjacent C-terminal strand in the 4-stranded -pleated sheet. This is in agreement with the measured stoichiometry of the complex and also with binding studies in the presence of an active-site inhibitor, which suggest that 1696 binds to the monomer [11].
Figure 6. Comparison of the Structures Adopted by the Segment P1­P6 of HIV-1 Pr The complex with scFv1696 is shown in yellow, and in the native protease (PDB entry 3hvp), it is shown in red. The superposition was made by minimizing the rms difference in the main chain atomic positions of the P2­P5 ° segment (rms difference 1.2 A).

HIV Protease Inhibition by a Monoclonal Antibody 893

Although docking one subunit only of the native protease also generates steric hindrance, the N- and C-terminal segments are probably disordered in the absence of the 4-stranded intermolecular antiparallel sheet, which maintains the dimeric structure. Indeed, a mature protease monomer lacking residues 1­4 has been shown by NMR to be significantly unfolded in the absence of an active-site inhibitor [20]. It is possible that, during immunization, the protease was presented in a partially denatured monomeric form and that mAb1696 was elicited against a nonnative structure of the enzyme. This possibility has also been proposed for the antiHIV-1 Pr mAb F11.2.32 [10] and the anti-polymerase Taq antibody TP7 [21], where the authors suggest that TP7 would trap a conformer within a set of thermodynamically accessible conformations of the enzyme. Two hypotheses thus emerge that could explain the inhibition of HIV-Pr activity by mAb1696. First, by binding to the N-terminal region of the native homodimeric enzyme, which is located at the external surface in the homodimeric enzyme structure and is thus relatively accessible to antibody molecules, mAb1696 could disrupt the dimeric interface of the enzyme, leading to its dissociation. Second, the dimer-monomer equilibrium of the enzyme could be shifted toward inactive monomeric species by capture of the latter by mAb1696. Although scFv1696 inhibits HIV-1 Pr nine times more efficiently than it inhibits HIV-2 Pr, measurements of affinity constants by indirect ELISA, made under buffer conditions identical to those of inhibition, show that mAb1696 and Fab1696 have a 3-fold higher affinity for HIV-2 Pr in comparison to HIV-1 Pr [11]. This apparent difference may be due to unaccounted systematic errors in either of the two kinds of experimental measurements. Nonetheless, the two experiments are different, one being a kinetic measure of inhibition and the other being a binding study under equilibrium conditions. Moreover, inhibition might conceivably begin before complete dissociation of the protease dimer has occurred if the initial interaction with the antibody distorts the structure sufficiently. This interpretation would be more in line with the first hypothesis for the inhibition mechanism.

olysis of their polypeptide chains is required to ensure correct virus assembly. By coupling mAb1696 with a fluorescent dye or protein, one could use it as a probe to elucidate the pathway that leads to the formation of a mature virus within an infected cell. Since mAb1696 inhibits the HIV-Pr from both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar range, it is therefore also a good candidate for studies aimed at controlling the viral infection with intracellularly expressed antibodies [22].
Experimental Procedures Inhibition of HIV-1 and HIV-2 Pr by scFv1696 Inhibition of HIV Pr activity by scFv1696 was measured from the cleavage rate of the substrate KARVNle-F(NO2)EANle following methods described in [23, 24]. Reactions were carried out in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) with 1% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.02% (v/v) -mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM EDTA. Native HIV-2 Pr and the Q7K/ L33I/L63I HIV-1 Pr mutant [25], which is highly resistant to autolysis while still retaining all enzyme kinetic properties, were used for inhibition measurements. A fixed quantity of HIV Pr (70 nM and 125 nM for HIV-1 Pr and HIV-2 Pr, respectively) was first incubated with varying amounts of scFv1696 for 20 min at 37 C. The reaction was then started by adding a constant amount of substrate solution (final concentration 0.135 nM), and aliquots of the reaction mixture, which were removed at fixed time intervals over a total period of 1 hr, were stopped by the addition of 20% (v/v) TFA. The quantity of cleavage product from each aliquot was determined by reversephase HPLC (Merck) using a VYDAC C18 column (4.5 mm 150 mm) and a methanol/water gradient. Kinetic data were analyzed with ENZFITTER (version 1.0.3, R.L. Latherbarrow, Elsevier-Biosoft, 1987). Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Complex Preparation The coding sequences for VL and VH variable domains of mAb1696 were obtained by RT-PCR from the total mRNA of hybridoma 1696 cells, as had already been reported [11]. A corresponding scFv construct contains the 113 N-terminal residues from VL and the 120 residues from VH, covalently linked together by the 15-residue (Gly4Ser)3 linker [26, 27]. For cloning, an intermediary vector based on pBluescript was first assembled by sequential insertion of oligonucleotide duplexes, introducing an initiator ATG codon (as part of the NdeI restriction site) and the codon for the first VL residue, the linker sequence flanked by the last two VL residues and the first three VH residues, and unique restriction sites allowing cassettelike insertion of the VL (EcoRV-XhoI) and VH (PstI-EcoRI) domains. Prior to the VH domain insertion, the C terminus of this fragment was modified by PCR so that the terminator codon and an EcoRI site could be introduced. Finally, the scFv1696-encoding region was cloned as the NdeI-EcoRI fragment into a T7 promoter-driven expression plasmid. BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, when transformed with the above expression plasmid, accumulated the scFv1696 product as insoluble inclusion bodies after induction with 1 mM IPTG. A 1-liter bacterial culture yielded typically about 10 g wet cells and about 1 g washed inclusion bodies. Solubilization and refolding protocols were adapted from [28]: inclusion bodies were solubilized in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 2% N-lauroyl sarcosine (SLS, Sigma). The solution was vigorously stirred overnight at room temperature in the presence of 50 M CuSO4 to oxidize SH groups by air. Urea was then added to 6 M concentration, and the SLS was removed by retention on anionexchange resin (Dovex). Refolding was performed by diluting the denatured protein and by dialysing into 10 mM borate buffer (pH 8.0). Purification included three chromatography steps, using DEAESephacel, Sephadex G-75, and Mono-Q 5/5 HR columns (Pharmacia). The fraction content was checked throughout the purification by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel and analytical HPLC gel filtration using a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia). Monomeric and dimeric forms of scFv1696 in equilibrium were observed. The purified protein was transferred by dialysis into 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH

Biological Implications In this study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a bacterially expressed scFv of the antiHIV-1 protease monoclonal antibody 1696 in complex with a peptide fragment that contains the linear epitope of the viral enzyme. The broad reactivity of mAb1696, which allows it to bind to both HIV-1 Pr and HIV-2 Pr with high affinity, derives from invariant amino acids or conservative substitutions within the first six residues of the N-terminal segment of the two isolates. Most of these residues are deeply buried at the antibody-antigen interface and establish extensive contacts to the antibody. Using the peptide as a guide, a docking complex of a whole protease monomer was generated that supports the hypothesis that mAb1696 inhibits HIV-Pr by favoring the dissociation of the active homodimer. For viruses such as HIV, which express polyprotein precursors, a careful regulation of the enzymatic prote-

7.5), 5% glycerol and was stored at 25 C. The yield was about 6 mg of the purified scFv protein from 1 liter of bacterial culture. Crystallization and Data Collection The complex was prepared by mixing scFv1696 with a 3-fold molar excess of peptide PQITLWQRR. Monomeric and dimeric forms of the complex were separated by FPLC using a Mono-Q 5/5 HR column (Pharmacia). In contrast to free scFv1696, these complexed forms are stable and do not interchange. The complex was concentrated by ultrafiltration on Centricon-10 (Millipore) to 14 mg/ml. Crystallization trials were performed by the hanging-drop technique using the sparse matrix method [29] as well as with a series of different PEG precipitants. Crystals were obtained under the following conditions: 1 l of the precipitant (0.05 M tri-sodium citrate, 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 24% PEG 3400, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate) was mixed with 2 l of the solution containing the complex of scFv1696 and the peptide at a concentration of 14 mg/ml and was allowed to equilibrate over a reservoir of 1 ml of the precipitating solution at 18 C. After several days, needle-shaped crystals appeared (the smallest dimension was 20 m). Crystals were transferred for a few seconds to the reservoir buffer with 25% (v/v) glycerol and were cryo-cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream (Oxford Cryosystem). Measurements were made at an ° X-ray wavelength of 0.93 A on the ID14-1 beam-line at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble) using one crystal. Diffraction intensities, recorded on a MarCCD system, were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite of programs [30]. The space ° ° group is P21, with unit cell dimensions a 45.50 A, b 57.05 A, ° c 91.03 A, 97.10 and two scFv1696-peptide complexes per asymmetric unit. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure Solution and Refinement AMoRe [31] was used for molecular replacement calculations. Rotation function calculations were performed between the resolution ° ° limits of 20.0 A and 4.0 A using the variable dimer of Fab1696 (PDB code 1lc7) as a search model and a Patterson integration radius ° of 20 A. Rotation searches returned two unambiguous solutions (correlation coefficients of 34.1% and 27.5% compared to 16.0% for the highest noise peak), which, in turn, gave clear results in the translation function. A 2-body translation search confirmed these solutions and placed the two independent scFv fragments on a common crystallographic origin. Rigid body refinement of the two molecules converged to a correlation coefficient of 70.3% and an ° ° R factor of 31.9% for 3636 reflections between 9.0 A and 4.0 A resolution. For control, a self-rotation calculation using data be° ° ° tween 20.0 A and 4.0 A and an integration sphere of 15 A diameter yielded a peak (height was 31% of the origin peak) corresponding to the rotation needed to superimpose the two crystallographically independent molecules. All the CDRs were omitted from the initial model, which was subjected to alternate cycles of molecular dynamics refinement with CNS [32], using the parameter set of Engh and Huber [33], and manual model building using QUANTA (Molecular Simulations) and O [34]. Rfree [35] was used to monitor the progress of the refinement by omitting 10% of the data (1286 reflections), randomly chosen, throughout the procedure. The main chain tracing was carried out using electron density maps calculated with weighted Fourier coefficients [36]. Using this procedure, the CDRs were successively built as polyalanine chains, and identifiable side chains were modeled accordingly as refinement progressed. During the entire refinement procedure, tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to the scFv1696 complexes (with a constant of 300 kcal/mol). Once the model for the scFv1696 molecules had been completed, connected density visible at the antigen binding site could be interpreted as the N-terminal proline and glutamine residues of the bound peptide. Subsequent cycles of refinement and model building allowed residues P1­P6 of the peptide to be fitted in difference electron density maps. The final statistics are given in Table 2. The quality of the model was controlled with PROCKECK [37]. Superposition of the various molecular components (PDB code 3hvp) was carried out using LSQKAB from the CCP4 program suite [38]. Buried surface ° areas were calculated using MS [39], using a probe radius of 1.7 A

and water molecules excluded from the calculation. Antibody residues are numbered using the Kabat convention [40], preceded by L or H for light and heavy chain, respectively.
