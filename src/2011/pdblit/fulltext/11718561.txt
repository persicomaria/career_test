Single raised X-ray space crystals of the Fab fragment of a murine monoclonal antibody BAT123 (IgGl,rc) against a dominant neutralizing determinant of gp120 of HIV that are suitable for structural analysis have been obtained. The thick prismatic plate crystals belong to group P2,2,2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 177.42 A, b = 37.36 A and c = 73.30 8.

The BAT123 murine monoclonal antibody (IgGl,lc) was prepared against the envelope glycoprotein, gp120, of the HTLV-III, strain of human immunodeficiency virus type I (or HIV-I). BAT123 binds to gp120 of HTLV-III, with a Kd of 7.1 x lo-" M and to a synthetic l&residue peptide corresponding to residues 308 to 322 of gp120 (Kd = 3.8 x 1O-9 M). It is capable of both neutralizing free HIV-I virions of infected T cells and inhibiting the format)ion of syncytia between uninfected targets and HIV-T infected T cells (Fung et al., 1987). The antigenic epitope recognized by BAT123 is in a region most sensitive for antibody neutralization on the envelope glycoproteins of HIV-I (Sun et al., 1989; see also Rusche et al., 1988). A chimeric antibody, constructed by genetic engineering methods to combine the variable regions of BAT123 and the constant regions of human IgG (rl,k) (Liou et al., 1989), is being manufactured for clinical trials of pa,tients with AIDS or ARC. Protein sequence analysis indicates that gp120 is probably heavily glycosylated around the molecular surface. The antigenic epitope with which BAT123 interacts is one of the few peptide segments in the native conformation that are accessible to antit Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

bodies. Structure determination of BAT123, in the absence and presence of the peptide epitope, should reveal important facets of gp120 that are susceptible to antibody intervention. It could also facilitate the design of better antibodies, as well as the development of other therapeutic agents that target on the sensitive site of gp120. The hybridoma secreting BAT123 was grown in Balb/c mice as ascitic tumors and the harvested ascitic fluid was mixed with 2 M-Hepes (pH 9.0, 4 M NaCl) at 1 : 1 (v/v) and passed through a column of protein A-Sepharose 4B. After the column was with 1 M-Hepes (pH 90, washed extensively 2 M-Nacl), the bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 M-HCI. The pooled IgG was adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1 M-Tris. HCl (pH 7.4) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The optimum conditions of proteolytic digestion for obtaining the Fab fragment are as follows. The purified antibody and 0.1 Mwas dialyzed against 2 mM-EDTA with papain Tris.HCl (pH 8.0) and treated (enzyme to substrate ratio of 1 : 100) for eight hours at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of iodoacetamide to a final concent,ration of 0015 M. A protein G column (obtained from Genex or Pharmacia) was used to separate Fab from the digest. An alternate procedure that was also used successfully is chromatography on a DEAE column,

M. N. Vyas et al. The crystals diffract to at least 3 A resolution, and intensity data have been measured with an SDMS two-area detector unit mounted on a Rigaku RU200. Attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement are under way. It is noteworthy that soaking crystals of the Fab in mother liquor containing the synthetic peptide epitope causes the crystals to crack and disintegrate. This of the the crystallization has necessitated Fab-peptide complex; small crystals obtained wit,h a slight variation of the procedure described above show similar crystal morphology.

using a salt gradient (60 M to 0.2 M-NaCl in 0@05 ivi-Tris . HCl, pH 75). In both cases purity was determined by gel electrophoresis. The crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique at 4°C. The protein and precipitant (PEG 6000) were buffered in 602% azide, 61 M-imidazole*HCl (pH 60). The 10 ,rd drops of protein solution (3 to 4 mg/ml) had 6% PEG and the PEG concentration in the well was varied between 12 and 16% PEG. The first crop of crystals were extremely delicate and had the tendency to grow as thin sheets or dislocated stacked plates. Micro-seeding technique (Thaller et al., 1981) yielded thick prismatic plate crystals: plates with of 63 mm x62 mm, with 63 mm dimensions tapered sides. Analysis of the crystals by precession photographic technique (p = 10" and S = 100 mm) using a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode (180 mA, 50 kV) revealed the following crystal properties: the space group, deduced from systematic absences in h01 and Ok1photographs, is P2,2,2, and the unit cell dimensions are a= 177.42 A, b = 37.36 A and c= 73.30 A (1 A = 61 nm). The unit cell dimensions were confirmed by intensity data measured on an area detector. Given the unit cell dimensions and assuming the relative molecular mass of one Fab molecule to be about 55,000, the asymmetric unit contains one Fab molecule. The value of V,,, of 2.21 A3 per dalton falls within the range (1.68 to 3.53 A per dalton) observed for protein crystals (Matthews, 1968).
