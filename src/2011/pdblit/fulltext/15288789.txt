Pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK; inorganic pyrophosphate: D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.90) catalyzes the reversible, metal ion-dependent phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. I Its bivalent function enables the enzyme to replace the irreversible enzyme reactions catalyzed in the forward direction by the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ATP-PEK; EC 2.7.1.11) and in the reverse direction by fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase (PBPase; EC 3.1.3.11) in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway. The discovery of the first archael PPi-PFK from Thermoproteus tenax has established the presence of the enzyme in all three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya. 2 However, although the enzyme is distributed ubiquitously, its occurrence seems to be restricted to certain bacteria, 3-6 higher plants, 7'8 and protists, t In general, two characteristics of the enzyme can be distinguished that obviously relate to their physiological function. 9 In higher plants and the green alga, Euglena gracilis, comparable activities of PPi-PFK, ATP-PFK, and FBPase are present and their PP~PFK is regulated allosterically by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. I° In contrast, all other organisms that possess PP~-PFK, such as Propionibacteriumfreudenreichii and Entamoeba histolytica, possess little, if any, ATP-PFK and

FBPase. Moreover, their PPi-PFK is not subject to allosteric control. Thus, PPi-PFK appears to play an integral role in carbohydrate metabolism in these organisms. However, despite extensive studies, in most cases the precise physiological role performed by the PPi-PFK remains obscure. Closely related to questions concerning their biological functions is the matter of the evolutionary origin of PPi- and ATP-dependent PFKs. ~ Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses indicate that the two types are homologous and originated from a common ancestor/2'13 However, ATP-PFKs form a rather homogeneous group with respect to their primary sequences and quaternary structure and are regulated allosterically by the energy charge of the cell and metabolite levels, whereas PPi-PFKs form a rather disparate group. PPi-PFKs display tremendous variability with respect to their quaternary structures and primary sequences, and most are nonaUosteric. Thus, the question arises: Are PP~-PFKs the products of a secondary adaptation from an ancestral ATP-PFK or do they represent the original phenotype, as suggested by their specificity for PPi, which is considered by many to be an ancient source of metabolic energy. 14-17 In order to address questions of phylogenetic origin of PFKs, as well as those concerning its physiological function, we examined the PP~-PFK from T. tenax. This anaerobic archaeon grows optimally at 86°. It grows chemolithoautotrophically on CO2, H2, and So as well as chemoorganoheterotrophically in the presence of SO and carbohydrates such as glucose, starch, or amylose. 18,19 Enzymatic studies reveal that T. tenax possesses two different pathways for glucose catabolism: the nonphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway and a variation of the EMP pathway. 2"2° The latter is shown by in vivo studies (pulse-labeling experiments) to comprise the main pathway for glucose degradation. 21 It is characterized by two different glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDHs) and a bidirectionally functional, nonallosteric PPi-PFK that replaces the antago-

nistic enzyme couple ATP-PFK and FBPase. a3,22,23As in other organisms, the presence of this nonallosteric PPi-PFK activity removes one of the main control points by which the pathway is normally affected. This article describes assays for and the purification of the PPi-PFK from T. tenax. The properties of the purified enzyme are presented, and the physiological role of the enzyme in T. tenax and its implications for understanding PFK evolution are discussed. Assay PPi-PFK can be assayed spectrophotometrically, in either direction, using suitable auxiliary enzymes and a pyridine nucleotide substrate. The continuous assays are performed at 50 °, which is 36 ° below the the temperature optimum of T. tenax, in order to maintain mesophilic auxiliary enzymes in an active, stable state. The assays are applicable for pure or enriched protein fractions as well as crude extracts.
Reaction with Fructose 6-Phosphate as Substrate Principle. The continuous assay is based on coupling the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to N A D H oxidation by non-rate-limiting activities of fructose-l,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), triose-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8). The phosphorylation of 1/zmol of D-fructose 6-phosphate results in the oxidation of 2/zmol of N A D H in this assay, which is monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 366 nm. Reagents and Auxiliary Enzymes. Stock solutions of MgCI2 (100 mM), N A D H (100 mM), potassium pyrophosphate (500 raM), and D-fructose 6phosphate (1 M, potassium salt) are prepared in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, at 50°) and adjusted to pH 7.0 at 50 ° if necessary. For routine assays such as the detection of enzyme activity during purification, the auxiliary enzymes fructose-l,6-bisphosphate aldolase (100 U/ml; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), triose-phosphate isomerase (250 U/ml; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (250 U/ml; Sigma) are used as crystalline ammonium sulfate suspensions diluted in assay buffer. However, for kinetic and enzymatic characterization of the PPi-PFK, the auxiliary enzymes are dialyzed extensively (3 hr, two buffer changes with 1 liter volume each at 4°) against assay buffer prior to use to remove the ammonium salt.

Procedure. To a thermostatted quartz cuvette of 1 cm light path a variable amount of assay buffer (1 ml final volume), 10 /zl of 100 mM MgC12, 4/.d of 100 mM NADH, and 10/zl of 1 M fructose 6-phosphate are added and the mixture is preheated to 50 °. Prior to initiation of the assay, the three auxiliary enzymes fructose-l,6-bisphosphate aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (20/xl of each enzyme solution) and the protein sample to be analyzed are added. The assay is routinely started by the addition of 10/zl of 500 mM PPi. The decrease in absorbance is first recorded 3 min prior to the reaction start to correct for N A D H oxidation at 50 ° not due to PPi-PFK activity and this value is subtracted later from PPi-PFK activity. In this assay the MgC12 concentration is very critical because concentrations exceeding 2 mM induce precipitation, which interferes with the assay. In order to verify that the N A D H oxidation observed is due to phosphofructokinase activity, particularly when assaying a crude extract, two modifications are introduced. First the assay is performed with variable amounts of protein sample. Second an alternative starting procedure is employed in which fructose 6-phosphate or auxiliary enzymes instead of PPi are added. Definition of Unit and Specific Activity. One unit (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 /xmol fructose 1,6bisphosphate per minute, corresponding to the oxidation of 2 /zmol of N A D H under the conditions described previously. For calculations of enzyme activity, the molar absorption coefficient of N A D H at 366 nm and 50 ° (e = 3.36 cm2//zmol) is taken into account. Specific activity is expressed as units per milligram of protein (U/mg). The protein concentration is determined by the method of Bradford. 24 Reaction with Fructose 1,6-Bisphosphate as Substrate Principle. This continuous assay is based on coupling the dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to NADP + reduction by non-rate-limiting amounts of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49). The rate of fructose 6-phosphate formation is equivalent to the rate of N A D P H formation, which is measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 366 nm. Reagents and Auxiliary Enzymes. Stock solutions of MgC12 (100 mM), NADP ÷ (100 mM), potassium phosphate (500 mM), and D-fructose 1,6bisphosphate (500 mM, potassium salt) are prepared in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HC1 buffer, pH 7.0, at 50°) and adjusted to pH 7.0 at 50° if necessary. For routine assays such as detection of enzyme activity during

purification, lyophilized glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (100 U/ml; Sigma) is diluted in assay buffer. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (150 U/ml, Sigma) is used as a crystalline ammonium sulfate suspension diluted in assay buffer or for kinetic and enzymatic characterization of the PPi-PFK dialyzed as described earlier. Procedure. The assay is performed as described previously with the exception that 10/.d of 100 mM MgC12, 50/zl of 100 mM NADP +, and 20/zl of 500 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate are used in this assay. The two auxiliary enzymes glucosephosphate isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (20 /zl of each enzyme solution) and the protein to be analyzed are added prior to initiation of the assay by the addition of 10/zl of 500 mM Pi. In addition to PPi-PFK activity, if an additional FBPase activity is present, a Pi-independent dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6bisphosphate is observed, which must be subtracted from the total rate. In contrast to the forward reaction the MgC12 concentration is not critical in the reverse reaction. Definition of Unit and Specific Activity. In contrast to the reaction with fructose 6-phosphate described earlier, the formation of 1 /~mol fructose 6-phosphate per minute (1 U) corresponds to the reduction of 1/zmol of NADP +. For calculation of enzyme activity, the molar absorption coefficient of N A D P + at 366 nm and 50° (e = 3.43 cmE//zmol) is taken into account. Purification

Growth of Organism. T. tenax Kra 1, DSM 2078, is grown at 86 ° in an open glass fermenter (50 liter). Because PPi-PFK activity is higher in heterotrophically grown cells. T. tenax is cultivated under a Nz/H2 (85/15, v/v) atmosphere in mineral medium as described by Brock and co-workers containing 0.1% glucose and 0.04% yeast extract. 21'25 Cells are harvested by centrifugation and stored at - 8 0 °. Preparation of Crude Extract and Heat Precipitation. T. tenax cells (15 g, wet weight) are resuspended in 25 ml of cold 0.1 M H E P E S - K O H buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.3 M 2-mercaptoethanol (ME). The cells are disrupted by passing the suspension through a precooled French pressure cell (35 ml volume, 200 MPa) four times. Cell debris is removed by centrifugation at 40,000g for 30 min at 4 °. The supernatant is incubated for 30 min at 80 ° and centrifuged at 40,000g for 30 min at 4 °. The supernatant liquid is retained for further purification of PPi-PFK. Anion-Exchange Chromatography. A column of Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany; volume 90 ml, diameter 2.5 cm) is equili25 T. D. Brock, K. M. Brock, R. T. Belley, and R. L. Weiss, Arch. Microbiol. 84, 54 (1972).

brated with 50 mM H E P E S - K O H (pH 7.5) containing 30 mM ME and 100 mM KC1 at 4 °. The supernatant from the heat precipitation is applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, and the column is washed with 0.5 liter equilibration buffer. Protein is eluted with a linear salt gradient, 400 ml total, of 100-400 mM KCI. The fractions exhibiting PPrPFK activity are pooled. Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography. A column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia; volume 20 ml, diameter 2 cm) is equilibrated with 50 mM H E P E S - K O H (pH 7.5) containing 7.5 mM ME, 200 mM KC1, and 0.4 M (NH4)2504at room temperature. To the PPi-PFK-containing fractions from Q Sepharose, (NH4)2804is added to a final concentration of 0.4 M and the mixture is applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column is washed with 3 volumes of equilibration buffer and protein is eluted with a linear gradient, 120 ml total, of decreasing ionic strength [0.4-0.0 M (NH4)2504] and increasing ethylene glycol concentration (050%, v/v). Fractions containing the highest activity and purity as deduced from activity measurements and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) are combined and dialyzed against 50 mM H E P E S - K O H (pH 7.5) containing 7.5 mM ME and 300 mM KCI and concentrated to 7 ml by membrane filtration (Centricon 30, Amicon, Witten, Germany). Gel-Filtration Chromatography. A HiLoad 25/60 Superdex 200 Prep grade column (Pharmacia; volume 325 ml, diameter 2.6 cm) is equilibrated in 50 mM H E P E S - K O H (pH 7.5) containing 7.5 mM ME and 300 mM KC1 at room temperature. The dialyzed and concentrated sample from the phenyl-Sepharose step (7 ml) is applied to the column and chromatographed with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Fractions containing PP~-PFK activity are examined by SDS-PAGE. Those judged homogeneous enzyme fractions are pooled. A typical purification is summarized in Table I. Properties

Stability. Enriched or homogeneous enzyme solutions can be stored for several weeks at 4 ° in 50 mM H E P E S - K O H (pH 7.5) containing 7.5 mM ME in presence of 100-300 mM KCI or 5 mM MgCI2 without loss in activity. PPi-PFK is highly sensitive to low ionic strength or to the absence of Mg 2+. Dialysis in absence of KC1 or MgC12 results in total loss of enzyme activity. Molecular Mass. The subunit molecular mass, as deduced from SDSPAGE, is 37 kDa, whereas the molecular mass of the native protein determined by gel filtration is 100 kDa. Thus, the quaternary structure of the enzyme cannot be derived unequivocally.

Values are obtained with 5 mM PPi, 1 mM MgClz, and 10 mM fructose 6-phosphate in the standard assay at 50°.

Kinetic Properties. The PPi-PFK from T. tenax is a bidirectional enzyme that displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics in both catabolic and anabolic directions. The maximum velocity of the catabolic reaction (2.8 U/mg) suggests that it may be slightly preferred over the anabolic direction (2.05 U/mg). The low specific activity of the T. tenax enzyme as compared to other PPi-PFKs (E. histolytica 45.7 U/mg) is probably due to the assay temperature of 50 °, which is substantially below the physiological range. 1,13 The affinities of the enzyme for PPi, fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate are similar (Kin values of 23, 53, and 33/~M, respectively), whereas the affinity for Pi (Kin 1.43 mM) is significantly lower, reflecting probably higher intracellular concentrations of Pi.1 Specificity. The enzyme from T. tenax exhibits high specificity for its substrates. The phosphoryl donor PPi cannot be substituted by either ATP or A D P and neither glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate can replace fructose 6-phosphate or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, respectively. The activity in both directions depends on the presence of Mg 2+ ions, and activity is inhibited readily by the Me 2+ chelator EDTA. The PPi-PFK of T. tenax is not regulated by known allosteric effectors of ATP-dependent PFKs such as adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP) and metabolites such as glucose, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which is a known allosteric effector of ATP-dependent as well as some PPi-dependent PFKs. Physiological Role. As in other organisms containing only the nonallosteric PPi-PFK, the enzyme is an integral constituent of the EMP pathway in T. tenax. 9 Because it replaces the antagonistic enzyme couple ATP-PFK and FBPase, one of the important control points in this pathway is lost. However, this loss is compensated in T. tenax at a later step in the pathway

[5]

by the presence of a highly regulated, nonphosphorylating NAD+-depen dent G A P D H (GAPN), which fulfills the missing control function.23'26 GAPN is a unidirectional enzyme and is regulated by the energy charge of the cell as well as by intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism. The enzyme is inhibited by NADP +, NADPH, NADH, and ATP, whereas AMP, ADP, and metabolites such as glucose 1-phosphate (glycogen degradation) and fructose 6-phosphate (EMP pathway) activate the enzyme. Underlining the catabolic function of GAPN the inhibition by NADP + and NADPH can be overcome as soon as activators are present. Its counterpart, the nonallosteric NADP+-dependent GAPDH, represents the classical, reversible, phosphorylating dehydrogenase, but kinetic as well as gene expression studies indicate that this enzyme is mainly involved in glucose anabolism (submitted for publication). Thus, in the presence of CO2 the glucose anabolism (gluconeogenesis) seems to be favored by promoting the gluconeogenetic NADP+-dependent GAPDH, whereas the glycolytic GAPN is inhibited by the cosubstrates of the NADP+-dependent enzyme -NADP +, NADPH-, or a high cellular energy level (ATP/ADP + AMP ratio). However, if carbohydrates are available for degradation or if the energy charge of the cell is low the inhibition of the GAPN can be overcome by elevated levels of early intermediates of carbohydrate degradation or of the counteracting energy metabolites ADP and AMP. Thus the allosteric regulation of GAPN allows, like ATPPFK in other organisms, a direct response to the availability of different carbon sources and the energy needs of the cell. Because the nonphosphorylating GAPN is used in the catabolic direction, bypassing the ATP generation by phosphoglycerate kinase, the regulation of the EMP pathway seems to be restored at the expense of 2 ATP per mole of glucose. However, the utilization of PPi instead of ATP in the PFK reaction allows the cell to regain at least 1 ATP per mole of glucose. PP~ can be considered as a waste product formed by different anabolic reactions such as RNA or glycogen synthesis, and in most organisms it is directly cleaved by a pyrophosphatase in order to drive these energetically unfavorable reactions. As in other organisms that rely on PPi-PFK for carbohydrate metabolism, no soluble pyrophosphatase activity is detected in T. tenax, supporting the role of PPi as energy donor. Phylogeny. Strikingly, similar to the PPi-PFK of Amycolatopsis rnethanolica, the PPi-PFK of T. tenax shows higher amino acid sequence similarities to ATP-PFKs (39-41% identity) than to other PP,-dependent homologs (20-30% identity). The highest similarities observed are to the ATP-PFK

of Streptomyces coelicolor (46.8%) and to the PPi-PFK of A. methanolica Phylogenetic analyses indicate that all ATP- and PPi-PFKs are homologous, orginate from a common ancestor, and cluster into three different monophyletic groups: (I) ATP-dependent bacterial and eukaryal PFKs, (II) PPi-dependent bacterial and eukaryal PFKs, and (III) a mixed group of both ATP- and PPi-PFKs of archaeal and bacterial origin, which include the ATP-PFK from S. coelicolor and the PPi-PFKs from A. methanolica and T. tenax. Because only members from two domains are present in each group, we cannot determine whether all three lineages trace back to a common ancestor or reflect lateral gene transfers that occurred after the segregation of the three domains. Thus, the question of primary or secondary origin of PPi-PFK remains open. However, at least in the mixed group (III), conserved structural features and short branch lengths indicate slow evolution rates and thus an original specificity for PPi,13 which is assumed to be the primary phosphoryl donor in ancestral metabolic processes.
