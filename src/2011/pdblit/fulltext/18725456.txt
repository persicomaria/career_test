Abstract Receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1 forms a heterodimer with calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and regulates its transport to the cell surface. The CRLRÁRAMP1 heterodimer functions as a specific receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Here, we report the crystal structure of the human RAMP1 extracellular domain. The RAMP1 structure is a three-helix bundle that is stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The RAMP1 residues important for cell-surface expression of the CRLRÁRAMP1 heterodimer are clustered to form a hydrophobic patch on the molecular surface. The hydrophobic patch is located near the tryptophan residue essential for binding of the CGRP antagonist, BIBN4096BS. These results suggest that the hydrophobic patch participates in the interaction with CRLR and the formation of the ligand-binding pocket when it forms the CRLRÁRAMP1 heterodimer.

Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are single transmembrane-spanning proteins that serve as accessory proteins for seven transmembrane-spanning G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). RAMPs were first identified as partners for the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR). Three RAMP isoforms (RAMP1­RAMP3) with different tissue distributions have been identified thus far (McLatchie et al. 1998; Hay et al. 2006), and they share <30% sequence identity with one another. RAMPs associate with CRLR with 1:1 stoichiometry and facilitate the trafficking of CRLR from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. The RAMPÁCRLR heterodimers have

defined the properties of receptors for calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM), members of the calcitonin family of neuropeptides that exert a wide variety of biological effects including potent vasorelaxation (Wimalawansa 1997). The cell-surface CRLRÁRAMP1 heterodimer functions as a CGRP-specific receptor, while the CRLRÁRAMP2 and CRLRÁRAMP3 heterodimers are AM receptors with distinct affinities (McLatchie et al. 1998; Sexton et al. 2001; Born et al. 2002; Poyner et al. 2002). RAMPs also associate with other members of the class-B GPCRs, such as the receptors for calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, glucagons, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, as well as some class-C GPCRs, including calcium-sensing receptor, suggesting that RAMPs may influence the functions of these receptors (Parameswaran and Spielman 2006). We previously generated and analyzed CGRP-deficient mice and reported that CGRP contributes to the regulation 1907

of cardiovascular function through the inhibitory modulation of sympathetic nervous activity (Oh-hashi et al. 2001; Kamiyoshi et al. 2006). Furthermore, analyses of RAMP1deficient mice directly indicated the critical roles of RAMP1 in CGRP signaling, which regulates both blood pressure by vascular relaxation and proinflammatory cytokine production from dendritic cells (Tsujikawa et al. 2007). In addition, our recent analyses of RAMP2-deficient mice demonstrated that RAMP2 is the key determinant of AM's vascular functions and is essential for angiogenesis and vascular integrity (Ichikawa-Shindo et al. 2008). There is considerable interest in the development of CGRP receptor antagonists as therapeutic agents to treat migraine and opiate-withdrawal syndromes (Salmon et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2007). For this purpose, the nonpeptide antagonist BIBN4096BS, which specifically binds to human RAMP1 with high affinity, has been identified thus far (Mallee et al. 2002; Hay et al. 2006). The three RAMP isoforms exhibit a common domain structure, consisting of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a very short intracellular domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal region seems to be the major determinant of ligand binding (Fraser et al. 1999; Zumpe et al. 2000). Deletion and mutagenesis studies on the N-terminal region of RAMP1 identified a stretch of aromatic residues that are likely to be important for the interaction with CRLR, independent of the CGRP-induced responses (Kuwasako et al. 2001, 2002, 2003). The disulfide bond arrangement within the RAMP1 N-terminal region was predicted by site-directed mutagenesis and used to build an ab initio molecular model of RAMP1 (Simms et al. 2006). In this study, we determined the crystal structure of ° the extracellular domain of human RAMP1 at 2.4 A resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the crystal structure of a single-transmembrane protein that functions as an accessory protein for GPCRs. The RAMP1 extracellular domain forms a three-helix bundle that is stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The putative CRLRinteracting aromatic residues form a hydrophobic patch on the molecular surface. Results and Discussion Overall structure of the RAMP1 extracellular domain The crystal of the human RAMP1 extracellular domain fragment belongs to the primitive tetragonal space group ° P4222, with unit cell constants of a ¼ b ¼ 43.10 A, c ¼ ° 82.99 A, and contains one protein molecule per asym° metric unit, giving a Matthews coefficient (VM) of 1.8 A3 DaÀ1 and a solvent content of 31.1%. The crystal structure of RAMP1 was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method, using the crystal of 1908

the selenomethionine-labeled protein, and was refined to ° 2.4 A resolution with working and free R-values of 22.1% and 28.1%, respectively. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. The final model includes 81 amino acid residues of the RAMP1 extracellular domain (Cys27­Ser107) and 17 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. The seven extra N-terminal residues derived from cloning and the four residues (Gly108­Arg112) at the C terminus of the RAMP1 construct were not included in the final model, due to their very weak electron densities. The overall structure of the RAMP1 extracellular domain consists of three a-helices (a1­a3) and a 310helix (h1) between a1 and a2 (Fig. 1A,B). The structure adopts a three-helix bundle fold, where a2 is aligned in an antiparallel manner relative to a1 and a3. a1 is kinked at residue Leu39. The Leu36 carbonyl group hydrogen bonds with the Leu41 imino group, rather than the Cys40 imino group (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the Arg37 carbonyl group hydrogen bonds with the Thr42 imino group, rather than the Leu41 imino group. On the other hand, the mainchain carbonyl group of Glu38 hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Thr42, rather than the Thr42 imino group. There is no hydrogen bond formed between the Leu39 carbonyl group and the Gln43 imino group. Therefore, the hydrogen bonds around Leu39 are not typical of those of an a-helix. As predicted by Simms et al. (2006), RAMP1 has three a-helices. However, the start and end points of the a-helices, as well as their positioning relative to each other, are quite different between the crystal and predicted structures. Especially in the predicted structure, a1 was not kinked, a2 was melted at its N-terminal eight residues, and a3, including the residues 91­103 that are required for the ligand binding (Kuwasako et al. 2003), was not correctly located (described later). Hydrophobic core of the RAMP1 structure There are multiple hydrophobic interactions inside the bundle structure of the RAMP1 extracellular domain (Fig. 1D). The interactions between a1 and a3 are mostly hydrophobic, involving the side chains of Tyr32, Leu35, Leu41, Phe44, Met48, and Val51 in a1, Trp56 in the a1­ a2 loop, and Val89, Phe92, Phe93, Val96, Tyr100, and Phe101 in a3. On the other hand, the hydrophobic interactions between a2 and the rest of the helices involve only the side chain of Leu69. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the other RAMP isoforms revealed that, despite the low sequence identities (;30%), most of these intramolecular-interacting sites are also occupied by hydrophobic residues in RAMP2 and RAMP3 (Fig. 1A). It can be predicted, therefore, that RAMP2 and RAMP3 adopt the same fold as that of RAMP1.

Stabilization of the RAMP1 structure Between a1 and a2, there is a disulfide bond (Cys40­ Cys72) that covalently connects these helices inside the bundle (Figs. 1B,D, 3A, below). In addition, there are two disulfide bonds, Cys27­Cys82 and Cys57­Cys104, which connect the N terminus to the a2­a3 loop, and the a1­a2 loop to the C terminus, respectively. These are located at both ends of the bundle and seem to reinforce the bundle structure. All six of the cysteine residues (Cys27, Cys40, Cys57, Cys72, Cys82, and Cys104) are conserved among the three RAMP isoforms, except that RAMP2 lacks the cysteine residues corresponding to Cys27 and Cys82 of RAMP1 (Fig. 1A). Among them, the substitution of Cys40, Cys57, Cys72, or Cys104 by alanine in RAMP1 drastically impaired the proper cell-surface expression of the CRLRÁRAMP1 heterodimer, while the deletion of Cys27 or the replacement of Cys82 by alanine did not affect the receptor function (Steiner et al. 2003). These results suggest that the Cys40­Cys72 and Cys57­Cys104 disulfide bonds play important roles in stabilizing the

RAMP1 structure that is required for the receptor function, but the Cys27­Cys82 disulfide bond is not necessary. The location of Cys40 in a1 may stabilize the kink of the long a1 helix. It should be noted that Cys72 is located in a2 and is the neighbor of Trp74, one of the possible binding sites of the nonpeptide antagonist, BIBN4096BS, in the RAMP1ÁCRLR heterodimer (Doods et al. 2000; Mallee et al. 2002). The Cys40­Cys72 disulfide bond may contribute to the structural maintenance of the ligandbinding site, including a2 and a3 (discussed below).

Comparison with other structures When we reviewed the structural homology search results by the programs DALI (Holm and Sander 1993), VAST (Madej et al. 1995), and MATRAS (Kawabata 2003), two proteins showing structural similarities with the RAMP1 extracellular domain were obtained by DALI: Rabex-5 VPS9 domain (PDB ID: 2OT3, chain A, Z-factor ¼ 7.4,

single-transmembrane protein that functions as an accessory protein for GPCRs has been determined. Crystal packing interactions There is one RAMP1 molecule in the asymmetric unit.

the wild-type protein (data not shown), possibly due to some unanticipated conformational change or distortion. Therefore, it is still unclear how the crystal packing interfaces are related to the association interface in solution. Molecular surface of the RAMP1 extracellular domain The electrostatic potential distribution on the solventaccessible surface of the RAMP1 extracellular domain revealed the presence of a hydrophobic patch in the shallow concave area formed by a2 and a3 (Fig. 3A,B). This region includes the residues that are highly conserved among the human RAMPs (Figs. 1A, 3C). The mutations of Phe93, His97, Tyr100, and Phe101 to Ala in RAMP1 reportedly cause parallel losses in the cell-surface expression and the CGRP binding (Kuwasako et al. 2003). Notably, most of these residues are within the hydrophobic patch (Fig. 3D). Based on the structure, we suggest that Phe93, His97, and Phe101 constitute an interface for CRLR binding. Tyr100 is involved in the hydrophobic core inside the three-helix bundle in the crystal structure (Fig. 1D), indicating that the reported effects of the Tyr100 mutation on the receptor functions are indirect. On the other hand, the previous molecular model of RAMP1 suggested that Phe93, Tyr100, and Phe101 form a binding interface with CRLR (Simms et al. 2006). Interestingly, the L94A mutant showed higher cell-surface expression of the receptor heterodimer than the wild-type RAMP1, suggesting that Leu94 is directly involved in the interaction with CRLR (Kuwasako et al. 2003). Consistent with this, the side chain of Leu94 protrudes from the molecular surface at the edge of the hydrophobic patch (Fig. 3D), and could directly interact with CRLR. Trp74, which facilitates the specific binding of the nonpeptide type antagonist BIBN4096BS to RAMP1 (Doods et al. 2000; Mallee et al. 2002), is also close to the hydrophobic patch (Figs. 3D, 4). This suggests that Trp74 of RAMP1 participates in forming the ligandbinding pocket on the surface of the RAMP1ÁCRLR heterodimer. We predict that the nearby residues Arg67, Asp71, Glu78, and Trp84, with side chains that are exposed toward the solvent (Fig. 4), may also participate in the ligand binding. The previous finding that the F92A mutation reduced CGRP binding without affecting its cell-surface expression (Kuwasako et al. 2003) suggested that Phe92, together with Trp74, may directly interact with CGRP, based on a molecular model of RAMP1 (Simms et al. 2006). However, our structure shows that Phe92 does not seem to directly interact with CGRP, as its side chain faces in the opposite direction to that of Trp74 and is buried into the a1­a3 interhelical groove (Fig. 3D). These residues are not completely conserved in the RAMP family, and thus may confer the difference

(;30% of the total surface area). The A­B interface is formed mostly by the a3 helices from two molecules (Fig. 2A), involving many hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. In addition, the C-terminalextended segment (residues 102­107) of one molecule interacts with the a2­a3 loop of the other. The hydrophobic interactions involve the side chains of Trp74, Phe83, Pro85, Leu94, Ser103, and Ile106. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed between Asp90 and His97 and between Trp84 and Cys104. On the other hand, the A­C interface involves the a2 helices from the two molecules (Fig. 2B). Trp74 of one molecule forms a hydrogen bond with Glu68 and a hydrophobic interaction with Arg64 from the other molecule. The two Asp71 residues are close to each other. The molecular mass of the purified RAMP1 extracellular domain in solution was examined by analytical ultracentrifugation. The sedimentation-equilibrium data indicated that the apparent molecular mass of RAMP1, using a single ideal species model, was 19,943 Da (data not shown), which is close to the calculated molecular mass of the dimer, 21,550 Da. The key residues for the molecular interfaces in the crystal, Asp90 or Leu94 for the A­B interface and Glu68 for the A­C interface, were mutated. However, these three mutants exhibited similar or even larger molecular masses, as compared with that of

Crystallization of the complex of the extracellular domains of RAMP1 and CRLR is in progress in our laboratories. Materials and Methods Plasmid construction, protein expression, and purification
The DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain of human RAMP1 (residues 27­112) was cloned into the pENTR/TEV/ D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After verification of the sequence by DNA sequencing, the expression vector was constructed using GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen) with the pCold I-Destination vector, which was inserted into the GATEWAY cassette (Invitrogen) in pCold I (Takara). Mutant RAMP1 plasmids carrying the E68A, D90A, and L94A mutations were constructed using the KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd.), following the manufacturer's instructions. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were designed with single base changes to incorporate each mutation and to engineer restriction enzyme sites to aid in the screening of mutants in the final constructs. The selenomethionine-labeled RAMP1 extracellular domain was expressed in Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) as a precipitate, and was purified as follows. The precipitated protein was denatured in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3), containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 20 mM DTT and was refolded by rapid dilution into 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3), containing 1 M arginine hydrochloride, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, and 1 mM EDTA. After stirring for 36 h at 277 K, the protein solutions were filtered and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), containing 500 mM NaCl, for the subsequent affinity chromatography. Next, the refolded protein thus obtained was purified using a His-Trap column, and then the histidine tag was removed by overnight digestion with TEV protease at 277 K. Finally, the refolded protein was purified to homogeneity by gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 HR 10/30). The yield of the purified RAMP1 protein was 4 mg/1 L culture. All of the columns were purchased pre-packed from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences. Due

that equilibrium had been reached. The absorbance wavelength was 280 nm, and the optical baseline was determined by overspeeding at 40,000 rpm at the end of data collection. The equilibrium data were fitted using the manufacturer's software (Beckman XL-A/XL-I Data Analysis Software ver.6.03).

Crystallization and data collection
The preliminary crystals of the selenomethionine (SeMet)labeled RAMP1 extracellular domain were obtained under condition No. 3 (0.2 M di-ammonium citrate, pH 5.0, 20% PEG3350) of the JCSG crystal screening kit (Qiagen, Inc.) by the 96-well sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. The crystals of RAMP1 used for structure determination were obtained in drops composed of 2 mL of a 4.1 mg/mL protein solution (20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.3 M NaCl) and 2 mL of reservoir solution (0.1 M tri-sodium citrate dihydrate buffer, pH 5.4, containing 0.15 M di-ammonium citrate and 25% PEG3350) by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method against 500 mL of the reservoir solution. Cube-like crystals grew to average dimensions of 0.2 mm 3 0.15 mm 3 0.15 mm within a few weeks. Single crystals were coated with the reservoir solution containing 15% PEG400, mounted using a nylon loop (Hampton Research) and flash-cooled in the cold stream of the goniometer. The diffraction data for the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method were collected at 100 K with three different wavelengths at BL26B2, SPring-8, Harima, Japan, and were recorded on a Jupiter210 CCD detector (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). Similarly, the diffraction data at a ° single wavelength (0.9789 A) were collected using another crystal. All of the diffraction data were processed with the HKL2000 program (Otwinowski and Minor 1997).

Structure determination and refinement
The program SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen 1999) was used to locate the SeMet sites and to calculate the initial MAD ° phases at 2.7 A. The data collected at a single wavelength gave a ° higher resolution (2.4 A), and were used to refine the model. The program RESOLVE (Terwilliger 2002) was used for the phase expansion and the density modification. The model was corrected iteratively using O (Jones et al. 1991) and the structure refinement was carried out using the Crystallography and NMR system (CNS) (Brunger et al. 1998). Refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The quality of the model was inspected by the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1993). Most of the graphic figures were created using the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). The atomic coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with the accession code 2YX8.

Analytical ultracentrifugation
All of the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out with a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. The sample buffer was 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 300 mM NaCl, and all of the experiments were performed at 4°C. The solvent density and the protein partial specific volume were estimated with SEDNTERP (Laue et al. 1992). Sedimentation-equilibrium experiments were carried out with six-channel centerpieces, with loading concentrations of 0.90, 0.45, and 0.23 mg/mL. Data were obtained at 10,000, 12,000, and 14,000 rpm. A total equilibration time of 16 h was used for each speed, with scans taken at 12 and 14 h to ensure
