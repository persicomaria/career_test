bg-crystallins from the eye lens are proteins consisting of two similar domains joined by a short linker. All three-dimensional structures of native proteins solved so far reveal similar pseudo-2-fold pairing of the domains re¯ecting their presumed ancient origin from a single-domain homodimer. However, studies of engineered single domains of members of the bg-crystallin superfamily have not revealed a prototype ancestral Ê solution homodimer. Here we report the 2.35 A X-ray structure of the homodimer of the N-terminal domain of rat bB2-crystallin (bB2-N). The two identical domains pair in a symmetrical manner very similar to that observed in native bg-crystallins, where N and C-terminal domains (which share $35% sequence identity) are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis. bB2-N thus resembles the ancestral prototype of the bg-crystallin superfamily as it self-associates in solution to form a dimer with an essentially identical domain interface as that between the N and C domains in bg-crystallins, but without the bene®t of a covalent linker. The structure provides further evidence for the role of two-domain pairing in stabilising the protomer fold. These results support the view that the bg-crystallin superfamily has evolved by a series of gene duplication and fusion events from a single-domain ancestor capable of forming homodimers.

The soluble crystallins are the main protein component in the eye lens, comprising up to 90% of its wet weight, and are derived from two protein superfamilies, the small heat shock-related a-crystallins and the bg-crystallins (de Jong et al., 1994; Horwitz, 2000; Wistow & Piatigorsky, 1988; Wistow, 1995). Both transparency and refraction depend on high protein concentration (Benedek, 1971; Delaye & Tardieu, 1983), which is provided by concentrated solutions and glasses formed from a diverse array of crystallin monomers and oligomers of high solubility (Slingsby et al., 1997). In long-lived species such as ourselves these crystallin molecules need to last a lifetime as they are trapped inside cells that have no protein synthetic or degradation machinery (Harding & Crabbe,

1984). The intrinsic stability of protein domains, their potential for higher-order interactions and their solubility are important phenotypes for crystallin molecules (Jaenicke, 1999). The superfamily of bg-crystallins is based on a modular design, with each polypeptide chain folding into four similar Greek-key motifs: successive pairs of motifs fold symmetrically to form the similar N and C-terminal domains that are connected by a short linker (Slingsby et al., 1997). Half the structural diversity required for the appropriate refractive index throughout the vertebrate eye lens is thus derived from one kind of building block, the bg-crystallin domain. Higher assembly in bg-crystallins involves domain pairing about an approximate 2-fold axis. In the monomeric g-crystallins the N and C domains pair intra-molecularly (Blundell et al., 1981). bB2-crystallin, the predominant b-crystallin subunit, forms four-domain dimers by pairing domains in an equivalent manner to monomeric

254 gB-crystallin, but inter-molecularly (Bax et al., 1990), by domain swapping (Figure 1; Schlunegger et al., 1997). It is generally accepted that the b and g-crystallins have evolved from a one-domain common ancestor that subsequently duplicated and diverged, followed by gene fusion events yielding the modern two-domain polypeptide chains of b and g-crystallins (Wistow & Piatigorsky, 1988; Lubsen et al., 1988; Norledge et al., 1996). What is less certain is the timing of the gene fusion event with respect to the association behaviour of individual domains. An early gene fusion event would be consistent with the hypothesis that an ancestral single bg-crystallin domain did not evolve an interdomain interface until covalent linkage allowed optimisation of a weakly interacting interface. Such a mechanism has been proposed for the Rosetta Stone model for the evolution of protein-protein interactions between unrelated domains (Marcotte et al., 1999), although this is unlikely to be the case for a symmetrical interface where the domains are identical or very similar. A late gene fusion is consistent with the ancestral single-domain capable of forming homodimers of domains with subsequent duplication and divergence of the single-domain ancestor leading to the formation of heterodimers of prototype N and C domains. Biophysical and crystallographic experiments on engineered single g-crystallin domains have not resolved the issue of whether single domains can self-associate in solution to form a non-covalent dimer that mimics the native domain. Mixing the recombinant N and C-terminal domains of gB-crystallin in equal amounts in solution does not yield a g-crystallin-like heterodimer, and this has led to the proposal that a covalent linker is required to raise the local concentration of domains for dimer formation (Mayr et al., 1994). However, there is evidence that the N and C-terminal domains of bovine gS-crystallin can associate in solution (Wenk et al., 2000). g-crystallin single domains are monomeric in dilute solution, although 2-fold domain pairing of identical domains has been observed at the high protein concentration of crystal lattices (Norledge et al., 1996; Basak et al., 1998; Palme et al., 1998). However, the geometry of the native pseudo-symmetrical interface of N and C-terminal domains was not always recovered with just one kind of domain. A good candidate domain to provide support for the late fusion of ancestral single domains is one that self-associates in dilute solution. A single N-terminal domain of rat bB2-crystallin (bB2-N) has been shown to exist as a dimer in dilute solution (>50 mg/ml), and is the ®rst single bg-crystallin domain which does so (Wieligmann et al., 1999). b-crystallins differ from g-crystallins in having N-terminal sequence extensions, and this bB2-N construct includes the entire 15 residue Nterminal extension plus the linker peptide (residues 83-88) which acts as an ``arti®cial'' C-terminal extension. It was possible that the N-terminal

extension was involved in stabilising the solution dimer of domains. Ê The structure of bB2-N was solved at 2.35 A resolution using molecular replacement (Table 1). The space group is P65 with two molecules per asymmetric unit (molecules A and B). The numbering of the residues of the rat bB2-N polypeptide follows Bax et al. (1990), where the residue numbering of bovine bB2-crystallin was based on a structural alignment with bovine gB-crystallin so that the N-terminal extension is numbered À15 to À1. Comparison of the rat bB2-N domain to the native bovine bB2-crystallin N-terminal domain (Bax et al., 1990) reveals very little difference in the structures: there are three sequence differences and the strucÊ tures have an RMSD of 0.99 A for Ca-backbone residues 1-84. Mass spectrometric analysis con®rmed that the domain comprises residues À15 to 88 (Mcalc11,896.00 Da, Mobs11,896.17 Da). However, it was not possible to model the ®rst 13 residues of the N-terminal extension of bB2-N, nor linker residues 85 to 88, in either molecule of bB2-N, suggesting a disordered conformation for the N-terminal extension and residues 85 to 88. This is further supported by an increase in

The rat bB2-N construct (residues À15 to 88) was expressed in Escherichia coli and puri®ed (Wieligmann et al., 1999). It was crystallised from hanging drops whereby 1 ml of protein solution (6 mg/ml) and 1 ml of well solution were suspended at 4 C over a well solution containing 0.2 M magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) and 15% (w/v) PEG 8000. Diffraction data were collected from a frozen crystal. Glycerol was added to the crystallisation buffer (20% (v/v)) as Ê a cryoprotectant. Data to 2.35 A were collected, using the oscillation method, on a MAR research 30 cm image plate system using synchrotron radiation at the CLRC Daresbury Laboratory Ê (l = 0.96 A). The point group of the data was determined using autoindexing in DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993). Intensity measurement and pro®le ®tting were carried out using MOSFLM, and the data were scaled and merged using scala (CCP4, 1994). The N-terminal domain (residues 1-82) of bB2-crystallin (Bax et al., 1990) was used as a search model to solve bB2-N by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navaza, È 1994). The structure was re®ned using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998).

255 B-factors of the de®ned residues towards the N and C termini. The disordered N-terminal sequence extension can be assumed not to be stabilising the solution dimer. However, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related to each other by a noncrystallographic approximate 2-fold of 179.4 analogous to the pseudo-2-fold pairing of the N and C-terminal domains in native bg-crystallins. When the inter-molecularly paired N and C-terminal domains of the native bB2-crystallin dimer are superimposed onto the bB2-N domain pair, the Ê structures have an RMSD of 1.46 A for the Ca backbone residues. The domain interface between the two domains in the asymmetric unit is remarkably similar to that between the N and C-terminal domains of native bB2-crystallin, with the equivalent residues from the second molecule of bB2-N performing the role of those from the C-terminal domain of native bB2-crystallin (Figure 1(a)). The total solvent-accessible surface area buried in the Ê dimer interface is 765 A per molecule. The core of the interface is made up from the hydrophobic patch residues Val43, Val56 and Ile81 from each bB2-N domain. In the native bB2-crystallin the same patch residues, plus the topologically equivalent residues from the C-terminal domain (Val132, Leu145 and Ile170), form an analogous core. In native bB2-crystallin the central hydrophobic patch is encircled by polar residues that make speci®c interactions across the interface and hence are dependent on the speci®c orientation of the two domains related by the 2-fold axis. Glu58 and Arg79 form an ion pair with Arg168 (topologically equivalent to Arg79) and Glu147 (topologically equivalent to Glu58), respectively. The side-chain of Gln54 hydrogen bonds with the backbone of residue 145 from the C-terminal domain, while the topological equivalent, Gln143, hydrogen bonds with residue 56 from the N-terminal domain. In the crystal structure of bB2-N the two equivalent ion pairs between Glu58 and Arg79 are formed, as well as the two hydrogen bonds involving Gln54 (Figure 1(b)). Thus the pairing between bB2-N domains and the native bB2-crystallin N and C domains is essentially the same, and these interactions are highlighted in Figure 1(b). Additional hydrogen bonds in the bB2-N dimer interface are found between Gly40 and Asp84 (Figure 2), and between Gly52, Glu58 with Ser70, Lys82 respectively.

Figure 1. The homodimer of bB2-N is very similar to domain pairing of the N and C domains in native bB2. (a) bB2-crystallin is shown in light blue (Bax et al., 1990). The bB2-N homodimer is superimposed on the bB2crystallin structure and molecule A of bB2-N is shown in purple whilst molecule B is shown in yellow. The superposition was performed using the program O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1994) and the Figure was drawn using the program Setor (Evans, 1993). The conserved hydrophobic side-chains of the interface region are shown in red for both bB2-crystallin and bB2-N, and it can be seen that they occupy equivalent positions. The polar residues that surround the hydrophobic interface residues are shown in blue for both structures. The topologically equivalent polar residues from the bB2crystallin homodimer and the bB2-N homodimer occupy equivalent positions in the domain interfaces of the two structures.

The N-terminal Domain of B2-crystallin

View of the C-terminal extension of bB2-crystallin showing how it crosses the homodimer interface to interact with the N-terminal domain of the partner bB2-crystallin polypeptide. The polypeptides of the bB2-crystallin homodimer are shown in blue. The bB2-N homodimer is superimposed on the bB2-crystallin homodimer, with molecule A shown in purple and molecule B shown in yellow. The superposition was performed using the program O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1994) and the Figure was drawn using the program Setor (Evans, 1993). Residues involved in contacts between the partner domains of the two homodimers are labelled. Hydrogen bonds are shown in green.

In native bB2-crystallin the ordered region of the C-terminal extension (residues 171-175) crosses the domain interface and interacts with the N-terminal domain, thus acting like a non-covalent linker. When the bB2-N domain pair is superimposed onto the native bB2-crystallin domain pair, residues Lys82, Val83 and Asp84 of bB2-N, domain B, follow the direction of the C-terminal extension of native bB2-crystallin, equivalent to Arg171, Asp172 and Met173. Asp84 interacts with domain A by making a hydrogen bond via its backbone nitrogen atom to the oxygen atom of Gly40 (Figure 2). In native bB2 the backbone nitrogen atom of Gln174 makes the equivalent hydrogen bond, but is out of register by one residue. A key additional interface hydrophobic interaction in native bB2 is between Trp175 of the C-terminal extension and Pro1 of the N-terminal domain (Figure 2). In bB2-N the residue that is topologically equivalent to Trp175 is Gln86 (unde®ned by the electron density in bB2-N), and so this hydrophobic interaction is abolished. Pro1

is part of an additional surface hydrophobic patch that is conserved in all b-crystallins, and which includes LeuÀ2, Gly40 and Pro41. Thus, the arti®cial C-terminal extension of the B domain of bB2-N partially compensates for the C-terminal extension of native bB2-crystallin, facilitating domain pairing by contributing a backbone hydrogen bond, but the Trp175-Pro1 hydrophobic contact is absent. The main driving force for dimerisation of bB2-N domains must thus derive from the interface hydrophobic surface patch and the surrounding speci®c polar contacts (Figure 1), and is strong enough to enable domain pairing from dilute solution without requiring a covalent linker to raise the local protein concentration. This implies that the interface between domains evolved before domain fusion. Biophysical measurements have shown that the isolated N-terminal domain of bB2-crystallin is much less stable than other bg-crystallin single domains, including the bB2 C-terminal domain (Wieligmann et al., 1999). The bB2-N domain provides a clear example of where higher order interactions provide mutual stabilisation of the protomer fold (Jaenicke, 1999). Pinpointing the structural basis for this lower stability is dif®cult, considering pair-wise comparisons of the various N and C-terminal domains of b and g-crystallins show only around 35% sequence identity. However, in the native bB2-crystallin protein, the Nterminal domain is stabilised at the expense of a decrease in stability of the C-terminal domain (Wieligmann et al., 1999). A contribution to this stability re-distribution may reside in the asymmetric structural feature of the native interface, namely the covering of a surface hydrophobic patch on the N-terminal domain by a constrained sequence extension from the C-terminal domain (Figure 2). This mutual stabilisation between nonidentical domains probably contributes to the observed heterologous N:C domain pairing as opposed to N:N and C:C pairings in native oligomeric b-crystallins. The C-terminal domain only forms monomers in solution (Wieligmann et al., 1999), whereas the N-terminal domain provides a more favourable partner. It is intriguing that at some stage during the evolution of the two-domain bB2-crystallin polypeptide the N-terminal domain has effectively evolved a structural dependence on the C-terminal domain. The bB2-crystallin polypeptide is involved in domain swapping (Bax et al., 1990; Schlunegger et al., 1997) and it has been invoked to have a role in solubilising b-crystallin hetero-oligomers (Bateman & Slingsby, 1992) in the eye lens by subunit exchange (Slingsby & Bateman, 1990). These processes require the N-terminal domain to become unpaired from the C-terminal domain. It is possible that the solubilising/exchanging role of bB2-crystallin is aided by the ease of unfolding of the N-terminal domain. The co-ordinates have been deposited in the PDB with accession code 1e7n.
