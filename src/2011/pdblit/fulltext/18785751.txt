ABSTRACT:

Big defensin is a 79-residue peptide derived from hemocytes of the Japanese horseshoe crab. It has antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The amino acid sequence of big defensin can be divided into an N-terminal hydrophobic half and a C-terminal cationic half. Interestingly, the trypsin cleaves big defensin into two fragments, the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, which are responsible for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, respectively. To explore the antimicrobial mechanism of big defensin, we determined the solution structure of mature big defensin and performed a titration experiment with DPC micelles. Big defensin has a novel defensin structure; the C-terminal domain adopts a -defensin structure, and the N-terminal domain forms a unique globular conformation. It is noteworthy that the hydrophobic N-terminal domain undergoes a conformational change in micelle solution, while the C-terminal domain remains unchanged. Here, we propose that the N-terminal domain achieves its antimicrobial activity in a novel fashion and explain that big defensin has developed a strategy different from those of other -defensins to suppress the growth of Gram-positive bacteria.

Defensins are polypeptides with antimicrobial activity, and they play a major role in the innate immunity of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (1-5). In terms of the disulfide pattern of defensin molecules, they are classified into four well-known subfamilies: R-defensins, -defensins, -defensins, and insect defensins (3, 4). The six half-cystines included in the molecule are linked in the 1-6, 2-4, 3-5 pattern for R-defensin, the 1-5, 2-4, 3-6 pattern for -defensin, and the 1-4, 2-5, 3-6 pattern for insect defensin. The -defensin peptide has a unique circular structure without a free N- or C-terminus, and it is expressed in limited species such as Old World monkeys (3, 5). Despite their different disulfide patterns, R- and -defensin have a similar three-dimensional structure that consists of a triple This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT), by the National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses (MEXT), and by the Program for the Promotion of Basic Research Activities for Innovative Biosciences (PROBRAIN).

stranded -sheet assisted by three disulfide bonds (1, 3-5). In addition, both peptides contain many positively charged residues and have a net cationic charge. Because bacteria, the targets of defensins, mainly form their cell membrane with a zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine and a phosphatidylglycerol possessing a negatively charged headgroup (6), it has been believed that defensins directly bind to the target membranes via electrostatic interactions (2-5). This idea is supported by the observation that many R- and -defensins have reduced antimicrobial activities in the presence of a high concentration of salt (2, 3, 5). Some groups showed the interaction of defensin with a negatively charged model membrane (7-10). Although it is not clear how defensin bound to bacterial membranes leads to the death of microorganisms, it has been suggested that defensin forms a transmembrane pore, resulting in permeabilization of the target membrane (7, 9, 10). Indeed, Lehrer et al. (11) showed that defensin treatment permeabilizes the inner and outer membranes of Escherichia coli and then suppresses the bacterial synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. Insect defensin has an R-helix structure in addition to a three-stranded -sheet; the R-helix and -sheet structure linked by disulfide bonds is termed the cysteine-stabilized R-helix and -sheet (CSR ) motif (12). The CSR motif is found in the structure of many defensins of insects and plants such as drosomycin (from Drosophila melanogaster) and Raphanus satiVus antifungal peptide (Rs-AFP) (13, 14). These defensins act on fungi rather than on Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (15, 16). Although the detailed mechanism of fungal growth inhibition remains to be

Kouno et al. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy. All CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-805 spectropolarimeter with a 1.0 mm quartz cell at 25 °C. Big defensin was dissolved in aqueous buffer [50 mM acetic acid (pH 3.5) and 20 mM NaCl] at a final concentration of 10 µM. The shape of the CD spectrum of big defensin at pH 3.5 was essentially identical to that at pH 7.0 (data not shown). For titration experiments, the samples contained 0.1-30 mM dodecylphosphocholine (DPC). The CD spectra of all samples were corrected by using reference samples of similarly prepared solutions but in the absence of peptide. Ellipticity was reported as the mean residue molar ellipticity. NMR Spectroscopy. Lyophilized big defensin was dissolved in 250 µL of aqueous buffer [50 mM deuterated acetic acid (pH 3.5), 20 mM NaCl, and 5 or 100% D2O]. To examine the structure of big defensin in a micellar solution, deuterated DPC (DPC-d38) was added at a final concentration of 100 mM. The NMR sample was centrifuged at 15000g for 1 min to remove aggregated peptide, and the peptide concentration of the supernatant was estimated to be 0.20-0.25 mM. All of the NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Bruker AV600 and AV800 spectrometers equipped with a cryogenic probe. DQF-COSY (25), TOCSY (mixing times, 50 and 75 ms) (26), and NOESY (80, 100, 120, and 140 ms) (27) spectra were acquired with solvent suppression by using the WATERGATE sequence (28). DQF-COSY spectra were recorded with 4096 × 512 data points, and the other spectra were recorded with 2048 × 512 data points and 128 scans. 1H chemical shifts were directly referenced to the resonance of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt. The assignments of 1H resonances of the backbone and side chains were performed by using a series of two-dimensional NMR experiments as described previously (29). The 3JHNHR coupling constants derived from the DQF-COSY spectrum were used for estimation of dihedral angles () according to the Karplus equation. Furthermore, 1 day after big defensin had been dissolved in 100% D2O buffer, slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from the TOCSY spectrum. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed with NMRPipe (30) and PIPP (31). Structure Calculations. For structure calculations of big defensin, distance restraints were collected from twodimensional homonuclear NOESY spectra acquired with a mixing time of 100 ms in 5 or 100% D2O buffer. The assignment of NOE cross-peaks and structure calculations was performed iteratively and manually. NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, and they were assigned to restraints of 1.8-2.8, 1.8-3.5, 1.8-5.0, and 1.8-6.0 Å, respectively, with appropriate pseudoatom corrections (29). The disulfide bond information for Cys-45-Cys-75, Cys-52-Cys-70, and Cys56-Cys-76 bonds was applied as distance restraints; specifically, the restraints for the Cys S-Cys S and Cys S-Cys C distances were set at 2.00-2.10 and 3.00-3.10 Å, respectively. The hydrogen bonds were identified according to amide protons that exchanged slowly with the solvent deuterium, and their partners were assigned on the basis of the early structure calculations. For hydrogen bonds, distance restraints of 2.30-3.30 and 1.30-2.30 Å were used for N-O and HN-O atom pairs, respectively. The restraints for the disulfide and hydrogen bonds and the dihedral angles were incorporated into the late stage of structure calculations.

elucidated, Thevissen et al. (17) reported that Rs-AFP directly interacts with a specific glucosylceramide, a membrane component of fungi, and then induces membrane permeabilization. We have explored the immunity of the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus; also called "Kabutogani" in Japanese) and identified a variety of immunity-related factors (18, 19). In the horseshoe crab, the hemolymph is responsible for the innate immunity system. The hemolymph is fractionated into hemocytes and hemoplasma. The hemocytes contain two types of granules, large (L) and small (S); degranulation occurs immediately after stimulation, such as the recognition of lipopolysaccharides, outer membrane components of Gram-negative bacteria (20, 21). The degranulation leads to a release of many immune factors into the extracellular space. These immune factors include coagulation factors, protein inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, and lectins that are induced to kill invading microbes and prevent leakage of the hemolymph (18, 19). Big defensin is found in hemocyte granules, both the L and S types, and it has a 79-amino acid sequence with antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and fungi (22). Recently, a similar peptide was found in bay scallop Argopecten irradians (23). The N-terminal half of big defensin is highly hydrophobic, while the C-terminal half includes many positively charged residues. Trypsin cleaves big defensin at the N-terminal side of Arg37, yielding two fragments, i.e., the hydrophobic N-terminal fragment and the cationic C-terminal fragment (22). The C-terminal fragment includes six half-cystine residues linked in the 1-5, 2-4, 3-6 fashion, like -defensin. Interestingly, the antimicrobial activities of big defensin can be divided into the two domains; the action against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria is derived from the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of big defensin, respectively (22). To gain structural insight into the antimicrobial activities of big defensin, we resolved the solution structure of a mature big defensin by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)1 spectroscopy. We found that big defensin has a unique structure; it adopts a -defensin-like conformation with a hydrophobic globular domain in its N-terminus. These results suggest that big defensin achieves its inhibitory activity against Grampositive bacteria in a fashion different from those of other -defensins. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Preparation of Big Defensin. Big defensin was purified from the Japanese horseshoe crab (T. tridentatus) (22). Purified big defensin was lyophilized and cryopreserved until further analysis. The purity and the integrity of big defensin were confirmed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The peptide concentration was estimated according to the absorbance at 280 nm, and the molar extinction coefficient was based on the number of tyrosine, tryptophan, and half-cystine residues in big defensin ( ) 20315 M-1 cm-1) (24).

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 40, 2008 10613 solution specified many slowly exchanging amide protons, and 49 of the total of 75 amide protons (excluding three prolines and the N-terminal asparagine) remained observable at least 1 day after the peptide was dissolved in D2O solution. Many of the slowly exchanging amide protons are consistent with secondary structures as suggested by the NOE connectivities (Figures 1 and 2), and 31 hydrogen bonds were selected for the final stage of structure calculation. The other 18 slowly exchanging amide protons are likely to be derived from residues buried in the interior of the big defensin structure. A total of 1096 NOE-derived distance restraints were collected to determine the solution structure of big defensin (434 intraresidue, 246 sequential, 159 medium-range, and 257 long-range restraints). In addition, the final structure calculation incorporated information from 31 hydrogen bonds (as 62 distance restraints), three disulfide bonds (as nine distance restraints), and 37 dihedral angles (), yielding a well-defined structure with a backbone root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) value of 0.49 ( 0.12 Å for residues 4-79 (Figure 3A and Table 1). According to the Ramachandran plot, almost all residues (except for glycine and proline) of the 25 structures with the lowest energy were within the allowable regions. In the selected structures, there were no distance restraints with a violation value larger than 0.30 Å and no dihedral angle restraints with a violation larger than 3°. The energy-minimized average structure of big defensin is composed of three R-helices (residues 15-24, 27-32, and 67-70, termed R1, R2, and R3, respectively) and two distinct -sheets (residues 12-14, 36-38, 43-45, 50-54, 60-63, and 73-79, termed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively) (Figure 3B). Strands 1 and 2 are parallel, while the other stands are arranged in the 3- 4- 6- 5 antiparallel fashion, as shown in Figure 2. The structure of big defensin appears to form two separate domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain with the 1-R1-R2- 2 fold and the C-terminal domain with the 3- 4- 5-R3- 6 fold (Figure 3). The C-terminal domain of big defensin largely consists of a bent -sheet supported by three disulfide bridges, Cys-45-Cys75, Cys-52-Cys-70, and Cys-56-Cys-76, which link 3 and 6, 4 and R3, and the 4- 5 loop and 6, respectively. Almost all secondary structures included in the C-terminal domain are fixed to each other through the disulfide bridges; therefore, the C-terminal structure adopts a very compact and well-defined conformation. Thus, the disulfide bonds contribute to the -sheet formation of the C-terminal domain of big defensin. The N-terminal domain is also determined with some degree of convergence despite its lack of disulfide bonds. The convergence may be due to hydrophobic interactions involving many hydrophobic residues, including two tyrosines and a tryptophan (Figure 4A). This idea is supported by the observation that the upfield shift was found in some 1H resonances of side chains included in the N-terminal domain. For example, the chemical shift values of 1H1 of Val-30 and 1H1 of Arg-37 are 0.12 and -0.01 ppm, respectively. These upfield shifts are likely to be caused by the ring current effect of proximal aromatic residues. In the case of the upfield shift of Ile-7 (1H2, -0.03 ppm), it appears to be involved not only in the effect of Tyr-8 but also in that of Tyr-65 and Tyr-66 included in the C-terminal domain (Figure 4A). Thus, a hydrophobic core is formed in

Finally, a simulated annealing protocol was applied by using 12000 steps at a high temperature (1000 K) and 8000 steps for the cooling process. A total of 50 structures were calculated, and the 25 lowest-energy structures were used for calculation of the energy-minimized average structure. The quality of the obtained structure was analyzed with MOLMOL (32) and PROCHECK-NMR (33). Structural figures were generated with MOLMOL. The detailed experimental data and the structural statistics are summarized in Table 1. RESULTS Solution Structure of Big Defensin. We successfully obtained the NMR spectra to analyze and calculate the solution structure of big defensin. Sequence-specific assignments for all backbone amide protons (except for Asn-1) were made by using the two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra. The assignment of the cross-peaks on the NOESY spectra showed the presence of secondary structure in the big defensin molecule (Figure 1). The consecutive connectivities such as dNR(i, i + 3) and dR (i, i + 3) are typical patterns characterizing the formation of an R-helix. Residues P15-L24 and A27-N34 explicitly indicate formation of an R-helix structure. In addition, the regions of residues A6-A11 and T64-C70 are also expected to adopt a helical conformation. The further assessment of NOE connectivity, including a long-range NOE, reveals the presence of two -sheet structures, a two-stranded parallel -sheet in the N-terminal region of big defensin, and another four-stranded antiparallel -sheet in the C-terminal half (Figure 2). Because no signal was found between these two -sheets in terms of NOE derived from backbone protons, they are expected to be noncontinuous as two separated -sheets.

the N-terminal domain, and it participates in adopting a single compact conformation. Moreover, the N-terminal and Cterminal domains make contacts with each other; therefore, the entire big defensin molecule has a tightly packed structure. Interestingly, two domains of big defensin exhibit a different surface charge distribution; i.e., in contrast to the hydrophobic N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain of big defensin includes many charged residues and has a cationic net charge (Figure 4B). All charged residues in big defensin are located in the C-terminal domain except for Arg36 and Arg-37; thus, the overall structure of big defensin has an amphipathic property. Structural Change of Big Defensin in Micelles. To examine the solution structure of big defensin in membrane environ-

ments, we acquired the NMR spectra of big defensin in 100 mM DPC-d38. The obtained spectra showed a drastic decrease in the number of cross-peaks for the TOCSY experiment and substantial signal overlapping for the NOESY experiment (data not shown). These findings indicate that the addition of DPC leads to a conformational change and/or a dynamic heterogeneity of the big defensin molecule. Fortunately, a part of the fingerprint region of the NOESY spectra gave informative about the solution structure of big defensin in micelles (Figure 5 and Table 2). Although the cross-peak was apparently broadened when DPC was added, the position of signals derived from some residues, such as Cys-52, Glu60, and Cys-76, remained unchanged. These residues are

included in the C-terminal -sheet of big defensin; for example, Cys-52 and Cys-76 belong to strands 4 and 6, respectively (Figure 2). In the NOESY spectrum of big defensin, a cross-peak between HR of Cys-52 and the amide proton of Cys-76 is observed before and after the addition of DPC (Figure 5). This result indicates that the C-terminal antiparallel -sheet, at least strands 4 and 6, is maintained even in micelles. On the other hand, the NOE cross-peaks between HR of Thr-12 and amide protons of Val-13 and Arg36 are completely lost after the addition of DPC (Figure 5). Because Thr-12 and Arg-36 are located in strands 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 2), the disappearance of the crosspeaks implies that the conformation of the N-terminal -sheet is affected by the presence of DPC micelles. This interpretation is also supported by the observation that there is no resonance with a chemical shift value of <0.40 ppm in a micellar solution; i.e., the upfield shifts found for Ile-7, Val-

30, and Arg-37 are no longer observed. Thus, the NMR experiment with DPC shows different behaviors of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of big defensin in micelles. The CD experiments also showed that the conformation of big defensin is altered in a DPC-dependent manner (Figure 6). As DPC was added to the solution, the shape of the CD spectra began to change at a DPC concentration of >1 mM, and it reached a plateau at approximately 3 mM. The ellipticity remarkably decreased in the range of 200-240 nm, while the opposite change was found at wavelengths of <200 nm. In addition, an explicit isodichroic point at 200 nm is indicative of a gradual transition from a native to another state. Taken together, NMR and CD data imply that DPC induces additional R-helix formation in the N-terminal domain of big defensin.

DISCUSSION In this study, NMR-based structure calculations yielded a well-defined solution structure for mature big defensin derived from secretary granules of hemocytes. Although, as a whole molecule, big defensin has a closely packed singleglobule conformation, its structure can be divided into the N-terminal domain, including the 1-R1-R2- 2 fold and the C-terminal domain assisted by three disulfide bonds. We searched the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for proteins with structural similarities to the tertiary structure of the Nterminal and C-terminal domains of big defensin by using

PAPIA (34). As expected, the search with the C-terminal domain found some -defensins such as human -defensin 2 (HBD2; PDB entry 1FD3) (35) and -defensin 3 (HBD3; PDB entry 1KJ6) (36) (Figure 7). In contrast, a significant structural similarity was not detected between the N-terminal domain of big defensin and any other proteins. Structures of both HBD2 and HBD3 are composed of a three-stranded -sheet assisted by three disulfide bonds and an N-terminal short helix. The N-terminal region including the R-helix is linked with the third strand by a disulfide bond; therefore, the -sheet of HBD2 and HBD3 lies in the proximity of the N-terminal R-helix. In the structure of big defensin, the region in which HBD2 and HBD3 form the R-helix is replaced by strand 3, and the C-terminal -sheet bends around helix R3 between strands 5 and 6 (Figure 7). Despite these differences in global conformation, it is noteworthy that big defensin includes a three-stranded -sheet characterizing the -defensin fold (3, 5). This may reflect the identical disulfide bridge pattern between big defensin and the other -defensins. On the other hand, the 1-R1-R2- 2 fold in the N-terminal domain is a unique

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 40, 2008 10617 (37). Interestingly, another -defensin, HBD3, possesses antimicrobial activity against both types of bacteria (38, 39). Schibli et al. (36) explained that the increased positive charge enhances the antimicrobial activity of HBD3 against S. aureus because HBD3 has a net charge of +11 which is greater than that (+6) of HBD2. Recent studies also showed that the positive net charge and the hydrophobicity of HBD3, rather than a spatial arrangement assisted by disulfide bridges, are indispensable for the antibiotic actions (40, 41). These interpretations can apply to the case of big defensin; the C-terminal fragment of big defensin when cleaved by trypsin has a net charge of +5, which is expected to be insufficient for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, it suggests that big defensin increases its hydrophobicity by incorporating an N-terminal domain to overcome resistance by S. aureus. Although a simple charge cannot entirely account for the antimicrobial activity of defensins because the hydrophobic HBD3 fragment with a net charge of +4 also exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus (42), it is likely that big defensin has developed a unique strategy for suppressing the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. The two domains of big defensin behave in a different fashion before and after the addition of DPC; the conformation of the C-terminal domain remains unchanged, while the N-terminal domain does not. This difference may be explained by the disulfide bonds in big defensin. The disulfide bonds in the C-terminal domain would restrict the structural perturbation, whereas the structure of the N-terminal domain is not fixed due to a lack of disulfide bonds. On the other hand, the DPC-dependent conformational change of big defensin occurs at a DPC concentration of >1 mM. Considering that the critical micelle concentration of DPC is approximately 1 mM (43), the conformational change of big defensin caused by the addition of DPC is expected to be accompanied by the formation of DPC micelles. This interpretation is also supported by a finding that TOCSY and NOESY spectra in the presence of 1 mM DPC are essentially identical to those without DPC (data not shown). DPC is a zwitterionic phospholipid with a positively charged choline group and a negatively charged phosphoryl group. Big defensin has an exclusive distribution of charged residues; i.e., the majority of them are located in the C-terminal domain. When big defensin binds to the DPC micelles, the hydrophilic C-terminal domain preferentially interacts with the charged groups of the DPC molecule. In

structure; so far, this structure has not been reported for any other -defensin. Our NMR studies showed that big defensin is a novel -defensin with a hydrophobic globular domain. We previously showed that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of big defensin give rise to the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, respectively (22). In other words, the C-terminal domain adopting a -defensin fold does not suppress the growth of Grampositive bacteria but does suppress the growth of Gramnegative bacteria. Like the C-terminal domain of big defensin, human -defensin HBD2 effectively kills Gramnegative bacteria, but not Gram-positive Streptomyces aureus

contrast, the N-terminal domain is expected to prefer the interaction with the hydrophobic moiety of the micelle interior rather than with the hydrophilic surface. These situations may be involved in a structural change and/or heterogeneity of the N-terminal domain of big defensin in a micellar solution. Intriguingly, residues Tyr-8-Val-30 included in the N-terminal domain are predicted by using SOSUI (44) to form a transmembrane helix structure. These findings imply an insertion of the N-terminal domain into the micelle interior and then an induction of the stronger binding of big defensin to the target membrane through hydrophobic interactions. The participation of hydrophobic interactions in the antimicrobial activity against Grampositive bacteria is supported by a fact that the big defensin action against S. aureus is not affected by the salt concentration in contrast to other defensins (22). Most defensins such as HBD2 and HBD3 have an amphipathic property, which contributes to an accumulation of the peptide molecules on the bacterial membrane (3, 5). It has been thought that this defensin assembly forms transmembrane "wormholes", resulting in a collapse of the target cell membrane. On the other hand, big defensin achieves the antimicrobial activity against S. aureus solely through the hydrophobic N-terminal domain, implying a novel mechanism for killing of Grampositive bacteria. In addition, we previously reported a synergistic effect in which the action of big defensin on Gram-positive bacteria is enhanced by the other immunityrelated factors, tachylectins 5A and 5B (45). Although our studies provided the solution structure of big defensin and a potential relationship between the antimicrobial activity and the structural property of the N-terminal domain, the detailed mechanism by which big defensin achieves its antimicrobial activity remains to be determined. Further analysis of big defensin, especially its N-terminal domain, will shed light on the physiological significance of the micelle-induced conformational change and on the unknown mechanism that overcomes resistance to antimicrobial peptides by Grampositive bacteria.
