Binding of GTP and GDP to tubulin in the presence or absence of Mga+ was measured following depletion of the exchangeable site - (E-site) nucleotide. The E-site nucleotide was displaced with a large molar excess of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GMPPCP, followed by the removal of the analogue. Using a micropartition assay, the equilibrium constant measured in 0.1 M 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (Pipes), pH 6.9,l mM ethylene glycol bis(&aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM MgSOl at 4°C was 9.1 X lo6 M-' for GTP and 4.4 X lo6 M-l for GDP. Removal of Mg"' reduced the binding affinity of GTP by 160-fold while the affinity of GDP remained essentially unchanged. Similar values were obtained if 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.0, was used instead of Pipes. Binding of Mg2+ to tubulin containing GTP, GDP, or no nucleotide at the Esite was also examined by the micropartition method. Tubulin-GTP contained one high affinity Mg2+ site (K, = 1.2 X 10' M-`) in addition to the one occupied by Mg2+ as tubulin is isolated, while only weak Mg2+ binding to tubulin-GDP and to tubulin with a vacant E-site (K, = 10' M-`) was observed. It is suggested that Mg2+ binds to the @ and y phosphates of GTP, and only to the /3 phosphate of GDP, as shown for the H. ras p21 protein.

Tubulin-nucleotide interactions are important ulating the polymerization of tubulin and in its zation. The tubulin heterodimer has two guanine tide binding sites; one site (exchangeable site or

in regstabilinucleoE-site)4

in the P-subunit binds GTP or GDP which exchanges readily with exogenous nucleotide, and the other, presumably in the a-subunit, binds GTP which is nonexchangeable (N-site) (l-5). Upon microtubule assembly, the GTP bound to the E-site is hydrolyzed to GDP while the N-site GTP is unchanged (6,7). The dimer, as isolated, also contains one tightly bound Mg2+ (8, 9), which is thought to be associated with the N-site GTP (10,ll). A second high affinity Mg 2f binding site involves coordination to the E-site GTP while a number of other weaker binding sites exist, some of which may be found at the acidic C-terminal regions (10). In a number of studies, the association constants of GTP and GDP for the E-site of tubulin have been measured using a variety of approaches. In several separate measurements of binding constants in the presence of Mg2+ using the Hummel-Dryer gel filtration method (12), values of 0.25 X 10' to 4.5 X 10' M-' for GTP and 0.67 X 10' to 5.0 X 10' M-' for GDP were obtained (13-17). Apparent association constants of 0.13 X 10' to 5.9 X 10' M-l for GTP and 1.2 X 10' M-l for GDP have also been determined using fluorescence techniques (18, 19). Recently, Farr et al. developed a nucleotide binding assay based on the enhanced recovery of j3-tubulin (synthesized in an in vitro translation system) and the heterodimer from a Mono Q anion-exchange column, and binding constants of 1 X 10' M-l for GTP and 2.5 X 10' M-l for GDP were measured for the dimer (20). In all of these previous studies, with the exception of the column recovery technique of Farr et al. (20), GDP or GTP binding constants had been obtained by measuring exchange of one nucleotide for the bound nucleotide. To our knowl-

edge, binding studies involving tubulin lacking a nucleotide at the E-site have not been reported. Studies on direct Mg2+ binding to tubulin have been limited. Most of the data on divalent metal ion binding have been obtained by exchanging Mn2+ for bound Mg2+ and have been monitored with the use of atomic absorption and EPR spectroscopy (10, 21, 22). Two classes of Mn2+ binding sites have been found, one high affinity (K, = 0.63 X lo6 to 4.0 X lo6 M-l), where n = 1 or 2 depending on whether GTP or GDP occupies the E-site, and several weak sites (K, = 2.2 X lo" to 2.6 X lo3 M-l). In this work, we have measured the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin in the presence or absence of Mg2+ after depletion of the E-site nucleotide by displacement with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GMPPCP, followed by removal of the analogue. We have also examined the binding of Mg2+ directly to tubulin by comparing its affinity to the E-site containing GTP, GDP, or no nucleotide.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Materials. GTP, GDP, and GMPPCP were obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim, [3H]GTP was obtained from DuPont, and [3H]GDP was obtained from Amersham. Pipes was purchased from Research Organics, Tris (ultrapure) was purchased from Schwars Mann Biotech, Mg*+ standards were purchased from Instrumentation Lab, Inc, and EGTA, EDTA, and 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Preparation of tubulin. Bovine brain tubulin was purified by three cycles of assembly-disassembly (23) followed by chromatography on a phosphocellulose-Bio-Gel PlO piggyback column (24). Purified tubulin was stored in PEM buffer (0.1 IM Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSOJ at -8O'C. Nucleotide analysis. The nucleotide content of tubulin was determined by anion-exchange HPLC as described previously (25). The purity of the nucleotides used in these experiments was also analyzed by the same HPLC procedure. Stock solutions of [3H]GTP contained 4.6% GDP while [3H]GDP contained 3.3% GMP as a contaminant. Samples of nonradioactive GTP were found to contain 3-4% GDP, the sample of nonradioactive GDP contained 2% GMP, and the GMPPCP sample had less than 1% GMP as contaminants. The GDP present in GTP solutions did not present a problem in binding studies done in the presence of Mg s+, because the K, values for both nucleotides are similar. But in the absence of Mg*+ the K. for GDP is much higher than that for GTP and the 4 to 5% contamination of GTP by GDP could lead to a large error. Therefore, for the studies done in the absence of Mg'+, the contaminating GDP was converted to GTP by incubating 0.2 mM [3H]GTP with 0.5 mM acetyl phosphate and 0.2 pg/ml acetate kinase (250 U/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. The conversion of GDP to GTP was confirmed by anion-exchange HPLC. Depletion of E-site nuckotide. Tubulin (35 pM) containing 0.96-1.0 mol GDP and 0.94-0.98 mol GTP per mole of dimer was incubated with a 1000.fold molar excess of GMPPCP (35 mM) in PEMD (PEM buffer + 1 mM DTT) for 30 min at 25"C, followed by column centrifugation through Sephadex G-50. Displacement of GDP by GMPPCP resulted in tubulin with 0.09 to 0.16 mol GDP remaining in the E-site. Binding of GMPPCP is weak and freely reversible (25) so the bound analogue is removed easily by gel filtration. Microtubule assembly. To test if tubulin depleted of the E-site nucleotide was assembly competent, the protein sample was assembled in PEMD buffer with 1 mM GTP and 10% Mess0 at 37°C. The assembly

reaction was monitored by the increase in apparent absorbance at 350 nm using a temperature-controlled Perkin-Elmer 555 spectrophotometer. Nucleotide binding. To remove Mg*+ in the buffer for binding studies done in the absence of Mgs+, tubulin depleted of the E-site nucleotide was centrifuged through Sephadex G-50 in 0.1 M Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT (PED). EDTA (1 mM) was also included in the binding assay mixture to chelate any remaining Mg'+. The protein in Pipes buffer was exchanged into Tris buffer by column centrifugation through Sephadex G-50 in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT (TED) in the absence or presence of 1 mM Mg'+. GTP or GDP binding to tubulin was assayed under equilibrium conapparatus with a YMT ultraditions using an Amicon micropartition filtration membrane. The use of the micropartition method to measure nucleotide binding to tubulin has been described previously (25). Tubulin (0.5-2 pM) with a depleted E-site was incubated at 4°C for 30 min with varying concentrations of [3H]GTP (5.0 X 10' cpm/pmol) or [sH]GDP (4.5 X 10s cpm/pmol) in PED or TED buffer in the presence or absence of 1 mM Mg'+. Each sample (400 ~1) was centrifuged through a micropartition apparatus at 4°C and 1500g for 3 min or until about 200 al of solution had passed through. The concentration of free ligand was determined from the radioactivity in the filtrate (lower reservoir). This value was used to calculate the amount of bound ligand in the retentate (upper reservoir). Controls were done using different concentrations of 3H nucleotide in the absence of protein to ensure that the ligand partitioned equally between the filtrate and the retentate portions. Nucleotide binding was also examined using a column centrifugation method (26). The binding assay mixture (100 al) was centrifuged for 1 min at 1500g through a 0.5-ml column of Sephadex G-25 in PED buffer with or without Mg'+. The concentration of protein-bound ligand was measured from the radioactivity in the eluate. Binding constants from both methods were calculated using Enzfitter, a nonlinear regression data analysis computer program. Mp binding. Binding of Mg2+ to tubulin was examined with the E-site vacant or containing either GTP or GDP. To exchange the Esite GDP with GTP, tubulin was incubated with 1 mM GTP at 4°C for 30 min as described previously (27). Tubulin prepared in this manner contained 0.19 mol GDP and 1.86 mol GTP per mole of protein. A similar procedure was used to displace GTP with GDP which resulted in a protein with 96% of the E-site occupied by GDP. The same method described above was used to prepare tubulin depleted of the E-site nucleotide. To remove Mg2+ and exchange Pipes with Tris buffer, the tubulin samples were centrifuged through Sephadex G-50 in TED buffer. Tris was the buffer of choice since Pipes caused some fluorescence quenching of the Mg2+ complex while Mes binds Mg*+ (28). Binding of Mgs+ was examined under equilibrium conditions using the micropartition method. Concentrations of free Mg2+ in the filtrate were determined by a fluorometric assay using 8-hydroxyquinoline-5sulfonic acid which forms a fluorescent chelate complex in aqueous solutions with Mg2+ (29). The YMT ultrafiltration membranes were initially washed by centrifuging 3 ml of TED buffer through the membrane to remove a contaminant that fluoresces upon reaction with the chelating agent. Tubulin-GTP (10 PM), tubulin-GDP (25 PM), and tubulin depleted of the E-site nucleotide (35 pM) were each incubated with varying amounts of Mg2+ in TED buffer for 30 min at 4°C. The sample (400 ~1) was centrifuged through the micropartition apparatus for 3 min. The protein-free solution (200 ~1) in the filtrate containing unbound Mg2+ was diluted twofold with 2.5 mM S-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7, containing 2 mM EGTA to chelate Ca2+ and other heavy metals that interfere in the analysis. Fluorescence measurements were done at 25°C using a Perkin-Elmer MPF-44B fluorescence spectrophotometer. The emission wavelength used was 510 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 4 nm, and the excitation wavelength was 405 nm with a 2-nm bandwidth. Fluorescence of Mgs+ standard solutions was determined similarly. The association constants and stoichiometry

were obtained using the ligand binding equation for two classes of sites from the Enzfitter computer program. RESULTS

this tubulin sample contained 0.15 mol GDP and, after the binding assay, the amount of GDP was essentially the same. The lack of displacement of the undepleted GDP in the E-site indicated that this fraction was unavailable for binding of added nucleotide and, therefore, the number of available exchanging sites in the protein was corrected by this amount in the treatment of the binding data. Using a simple and rapid microNwleotide binding. partition method to measure binding of GTP and GDP to tubulin under equilibrium conditions, we obtained binding data in the form of Scatchard plots, shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The association constants are summarized in Table I. In Tris buffer and in the presence of 1 mM Mg*+, the affinity of GTP for the E-site (6.2 X lo6 M-`) was 3-fold higher than that of GDP (1.9 X lo6 M-l). However, in the absence of Mg*+, the binding constant for GDP (2.0 X lo6 M-`) was about loo-fold higher than that for GTP. It was also evident that the presence of Mg*+ increased the association constant of GTP by 160- to 280fold. In contrast, Mg *+ had no significant effect on the affinity of GDP to the E-site. The binding constants were not affected to a large extent by changing the buffer to Pipes.

Depletion of the E-site nuckotide. Displacement of GDP from the E-site by the GTP analogue, GMPPCP, and other nucleotides has been previously demonstrated in our laboratory and by others (25, 27, 30). We used a large molar excess of the analogue (lOOO-fold) to ensure removal of most of the E-site nucleotide. This was necessary to be able to measure direct binding of GDP or GTP to the E-site. A small fraction of GDP (9 to 16% of the E-site nucleotide) remained bound after depletion. It was important to show that the removal of the Esite nucleotide did not alter the ability of tubulin to polymerize into microtubules. After depletion of the E-site nucleotide, the protein samples were kept in PEMD or PED buffer at 4°C for 30 min (the same conditions used in the binding assay) in the absence of exogenous nucleotide. In one case, the protein was first centrifuged into Mg*+-free buffer. As shown in Fig. 1, nucleotide-depleted tubulin was capable of polymerizing in PEMD after the addition of 1 mM GTP and 10% Me2S0. Based on the extent of assembly (turbidity plateau values) a small loss of assembly competence occurred with Mg2+ present in the binding assay mixture, when compared to the untreated control, while in the Mg2+-free system about a 25% loss occurred. In all three cases, the polymers formed were primarily microtubules and were depolymerized completely by cold treatment. To determine whether the remaining undepleted GDP at the E-site could be displaced by added nucleotide during the binding assay, tubulin (0.5 PM) which was incubated with the highest concentration of the ligand GTP used (18 PM) was analyzed for its nucleotide content.

In measuring binding of GTP in the absence of Mg'+, GTP free of contaminating GDP was used. This was done to avoid significant binding of GDP that would otherwise occur since the affinity for GDP was loo-fold higher than that for GTP in the absence of the metal ion. Purification of a stock solution of GTP was achieved by phosphorylation of the GDP present by acetyl phosphate catalyzed by acetate kinase. The undepleted GDP in the E-site was not converted to GTP by the GTP regenerating system present in the GTP added during the binding assay. The binding constants obtained using purified GTP were 2to 3-fold lower than those using GTP which contained 5% GDP as a contaminant. In the case of GTP binding in the presence of Mg2+, association constants for MgGTP binding were also calculated. The concentration of MgGTP for each nucleotide concentration used was calculated from a reported association constant for binding of Mg2+ to GTP, 2.83 X lo3 M-l (31). Binding constants of 1.4 X 10' M-l in Tris buffer and 2.1 X lo7 M-l in Pipes buffer were obtained, 2- to 3fold higher than that calculated for GTP alone. Based on these values, the affinity of MgGTP was 400- to 600-fold greater than that for GTP in the absence of the metal ion and 5- to 7-fold higher than that of GDP in the presence of Mg2+. Binding of GTP and GDP to the E-site in the presence of Mg2+ was also examined at pH 8 in Tris buffer to ensure that all the GTP was in the MgGTP2- complex. The measured association constants at pH 8, 6.6 X lo6 M-' for GTP and 1.2 X lo6 M-l for GDP, did not differ significantly from those obtained at pH 6.9 (Table I). The metal ion was also replaced by Ca2+, and binding of GTP to the E-site was compared with that in the presence of Mg2+. The affinity of GTP in Tris buffer (1.4 X lo6 M-`) was found to be 4.4-fold lower in the presence of Ca2+ than in

the presence of Mg'+. Assuming that the association constant of Ca2+ for GTP is 2-fold lower than that of Mg2+ for GTP (32), we calculated a binding constant of 3.8 X lo6 M-' for CaGTP to tubulin, 3.7-fold lower than the constant for MgGTP. Binding of the guanine nucleotides was also studied using the column centrifugation technique. The measured association constants (in Pipes), 9.4 X IO6 M-l for MgGTP, 2.7 X lo6 M-l for GDP in the presence of Mg2+, and 4.6 X lo6 M-l for GDP in the absence of the metal ion, did not differ much from those obtained by the micropartition method. In the absence of Mg2+, GTP binding cannot be measured by the column centrifugation method because bound nucleotide is released from the E-site during gel filtration in Mg2+-free buffer (31). Another major disadvantage of this method is that protein concentrations 32 PM have to be used to avoid a large loss in protein yields after centrifugation (>40%) due to binding to the gel. h4p binding. We studied the relationship between the binding of Mg2+ and the nucleotide content of the Emethod and a sensitive flusite using the micropartition orometric assay for Mg2+. In these studies, binding of Mg2+ to the N-site was not considered since that site was already occupied by Mg2+. The Scatchard binding isotherm indicated the existence of more than one class of sites as shown in Fig. 4. However, over the concentration range studied, only tubulin-GTP showed a high affinity site. Fitting the data on binding of Mg2+ to tubulin-GTP into an equation for ligand binding to two classes of sites yielded an association constant of 1.2 X lo6 M-' (nl = 0.6) for the high affinity site and 1.8 X lo3 M-' (e = 11) for the low affinity sites. The binding isotherm for tubulinGDP and tubulin with a vacant E-site did not show strong binding at low Mg2+ concentrations. By fitting the data to binding curves constructed using different K, values, we found that an association constant of about 1 X lo3 M-' for tubulin with GDP or no nucleotide at the E-site gave good fits to the data.

FIG. 4. Scatchard plots for binding of Mg2+ to tubulin with the Esite containing GTP (10 pM) (A), GDP (35 pM) (O), or no nucleotide (25 pM) (0). Tubulin was incubated at 4°C for 30 min with different concentrations of Mg*+ and bmding was measured by the micropartition method. Concentrations of free Mg2+ were determined by a fluorometric assay as described under Experimental Procedures.

DISCUSSION Studies of guanine nucleotide binding to tubulin with an E-site depleted of nucleotide have been difficult due to the high affinities of GTP and GDP for the E-site of tubulin in the presence of Mg'+. As isolated, the E-site of tubulin is occupied with guanine nucleotide, making the determination of an absolute value for binding constants impossible since only the exchange of exogenous nucleotide for bound nucleotide can be measured. Although attempts to remove these nucleotides have been made by treatment with charcoal (6, 33, 34) or alkaline phosphatase (35,36), these methods often resulted in unstable or denatured protein. To enable the study of nucleotide binding, we used a rapid and mild procedure for maximum depletion of E-site nucleotide. Based on previous findings that GTP analogues such as GMPPCP can bind to the E-site (25, 30), incubation of tubulin-GDP with a lOOO-fold molar excess of GMPPCP resulted in the dissociation of 85-90% of the nucleotide from the Esite. The small fraction of residual GDP that remained after depletion may represent denatured and/or aggregated protein. By using the protein immediately for binding experiments, problems with instability were avoided. The GTP and GDP binding constants in the presence of Mg2+ calculated from our data (Table I) were generally at the lower end of the range of previously reported values (13-20). These differences may be a reflection of the different methods used in determining the association constants. While the earlier studies used a combination of competitive displacement methods, fluorescence techniques, and the Hummel-Dryer approach, we measured binding directly to tubulin with a nucleotide-depleted Esite using a micropartition assay. Another source of dis-

crepancy between our values and previously published ones may lie in the inaccuracy of the binding data obtained by the Hummel-Dryer procedure. The disadvantages of using this technique for obtaining nucleotide binding constants, especially when measuring binding under conditions of saturating ligand, have been previously pointed out (15, 17). It is possible that removal of the E-site nucleotide produced some conformational change in the protein that resulted in a decreased affinity of GTP and GDP for the E-site; however, the assembly properties of the protein were not drastically changed. It has been previously shown from fluorescence data that conformational differences exist between tubulin containing bound exchangeable nucleotide and tubulin with a vacant E-site (18, 37). Huang et al. reported differences in the effects of Mg2+ on the competitive binding of GTP and GDP using column centrifugation assays (16). They found that GDP binds with similar affinity to the E-site in the presence or absence of Mg2+ while MgGTP binds more tightly to tubulin than GTP. Correia et al. also examined guanine nucleotide binding and its dependence on Mg2+ using competitive binding studies (31). Nucleotide binding constants were calculated by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data into a series of multiple equilibrium equations. In these calculations, an affinity constant for the binding of GDP to tubulin (in the absence of Mg2+) of 1.6 X lo7 M-' reported by Zeeberg and Caplow (15) was used. In the absence of Mg2+, Correia et al. calculated that the affinity for GTP (K, < 1.4 X lo4 M-l) was at least 1100 times smaller than the affinity for GDP, while in the presence of Mg2+, the binding constant of GTP was 6.4 X lo7 to 9.0 X lo7 M-l, about 3-fold higher than that for GDP. Since Correia et al. used a value for the GDP binding constant which was 4- to g-fold higher than what we determined, their other calculated binding constants would be expected to differ from our values. Using a unique binding assay, Farr et al. similarly observed a reduction (800-fold) in the apparent affinity for GTP in the absence of Mg2+ while GDP binding was unaffected (20). In spite of the differences in the absolute values that we obtained compared to some of the reported constants, we find the same relationships between GTP and GDP binding and the effect of Mg2+ on GTP binding reported by Correia et al. (31), Farr et al. (20), and Huang et al. (16). In the complete absence of Mg2+, the binding affinity of GDP is at least loo-fold stronger than that of GTP. In the presence of the metal ion, the association constant for GTP is slightly higher than that for GDP. One attempt to explain the difference in Mg2+ dependence between GTP and GDP binding has been made by Sternlicht et al. (39). They proposed a model for the nucleotide binding site in tubulin from sequence comparisons with GTP and ATP binding proteins and topological considerations. They proposed that the a- and P-phosphate groups of

GDP and MgGDP bind to two phosphoryl binding loops in a Mg2+ -independent manner while the @-and y-phosphate groups of GTP, due to steric constraints, bind to one of these loops and a third loop when complexed to Mg2+. However, at the present time there is no known molecular basis to explain the differences between the affinities of GTP and MgGTP and the similar affinities of GDP and MgGDP. Differences in the effects of Mg2+ on the binding affinities of GTP$S and GDP have also been found for the G, prot,ein (40,41). Our data showed that binding of Mg2+ to tubulin-GTP was lOOO-fold stronger than that to tubulin-GDP or tubulin depleted of its E-site nucleotide. While no previous direct Mg2+ binding studies have been reported, data from measuring the exchange of Mn2+ for Mg2+ indicated that the number of high affinity Mn2+ sites correlated with the amount of bound GTP at t.he E-site; i.e. one high affinity site (N-site) exists when the E-site is depleted or contains GDP, while two high affinity sites exist when the E-site is occupied by GTP (10, 22, 31). Mg2+ association constants resulting from data fitting to a set of binding equilibria and measuring the exchange of Mn2+ for bound Mg2+ have been calculated: 0.7 X lo6 to 1.0 X lo6 M-' for Mg2+ binding to the N- and E-sites, both containing GTP, and 2.0 X lo3 to 2.3 X lo3 M-l for binding to tubulin containing GDP at the E-site (10). These constants are essentially equal to the corresponding values reported in our work. The binding affinity of Mg2+ for G, protein also shows a large dependence on the nucleotide bound, GDP or GTPyS (40). From the three-dimensional structures and EPR measurements of GTP analogue complexes of the H. ras-encoded p21 protein, Mg2+ (or Mn2+) was shown to be coordinated to one oxygen each from the /3- and yphosphates of the nucleotide, two protein side chains, and two H,O ligands (42,43). In the GDP complex, two solvent molecules replace the y-phosphate of the nucleotide and one of the protein residues as ligands (43, 44). An analogous situation may exist in the metal ion coordination sphere in tubulin. The presence of an additional protein ligand for Mg2+ when GTP is bound could explain the large difference in the binding affinities of Mg2+ for tubulin-GTP and tubulin-GDP. It can also be envisioned that two different tubulin conformations are induced by the binding of GTP, depending on whether Mg2+ is present or not. Upon binding of GTP in the presence of Mg2+, a change in the orientation of amino acid side chains may occur such that they can interact with Mg2+ and the yphosphate of GTP. Since Mg2+ is presumably in a bidentate complex with the bound GTP, in the absence of the metal ion ligand, electrostatic repulsion may occur between the y-phosphate group and a nearby acidic residue in the protein, as suggested by Sternlicht et al. (39). This conformational switch could lead to the loss of important interactions with tubulin in the ternary complex, ex-

plaining the much weaker affinity of GTP in the absence of Mg2+. In the case of GDP binding, in the absence of Mg2+ the repulsion due to the y-phosphate would be absent and, as a result, binding a&&y would not be affected.
