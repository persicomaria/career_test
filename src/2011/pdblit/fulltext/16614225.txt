Conformational Switches Modulate Protein Interactions in Peptide Antibiotic Synthetases
¨fer, ¨ Alexander Koglin,1 Mohammad R. Mofid,2* Frank Lohr,1 Birgit Scha 1 Vladimir V. Rogov,1,3 Marc-Michael Blum,1 Tanja Mittag,1 Mohamed A. Marahiel,2 Frank Bernhard,1 ¨ Volker Dotsch1 Protein dynamics plays an important role in protein function. Many functionally important motions occur on the microsecond and low millisecond time scale and can be characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments. We describe the different states of a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) that play a crucial role in its function as a peptide shuttle in the nonribosomal peptide synthetases of the tyrocidine A system. Both apo-PCP (without the bound 4¶-phosphopantetheine cofactor) and holo-PCP exist in two different stable conformations. We show that one of the apo conformations and one of the holo conformations are identical, whereas the two remaining conformations are only detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in either the apo or holo form. We further demonstrate that this conformational diversity is an essential prerequisite for the directed movement of the 4¶-PP cofactor and its interaction with externally acting proteins such as thioesterases and 4¶-PP transferase. vast number of small and structurally diverse bioactive peptides with broad therapeutic potential is produced by the modular megaenzyme super family of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) (1­4). These complex peptides are synthesized by multiplestep mechanisms that require amino acyl adenylation of the building blocks followed by thioesterification on distinctive cysteamine thiol groups of intrinsic 4¶-phosphopantetheine (4¶-PP) cofactors (1, 4). The cofactors are attached to the side chain of conserved serine residues of small internal peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs) (5). PCPs shuttle intermediates between individual NRPS modules during the assembly line peptide synthesis. The N termini of the PCP domains are fused to acyl-adenylate­forming domains (A-domains) of the NRPS modules. These A-domains are responsible for the selection and activation of the specific amino acid constituents of the final peptide products. Peptide-bond­forming condensing domains (C-domains) are attached to the C termini of the PCPs (1). The transfer of peptide intermediates between A- and C-domains by PCPs therefore requires large movements of the 4¶-PP cofactor

that have been described by a Bswinging arm[ model (6). However, the mobility has not been characterized at a molecular level. Detailed analysis of E15N, 1H^-TROSY (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy) spectra of the apo-PCP domain of the third module of tyrocidine A synthetase (TycC3PCP) indicated that several backbone resonances show two distinct chemical shifts, suggesting the existence of two different and slowly exchanging conformations. These residues are mainly clustered in two regions (fig. S1), one comprising the N terminus of helix aII and the adjacent loop (H44 to A53), including the active site residue S45, and the second one spanning residue R57 to T73, including most residues between helices aII and aIV. Upon conversion to the holo form by modification with the 4¶-PP cofactor, the pattern of peak doubling of the TycC3-PCP domain changes (figs. S1 and S2), suggesting that the holo form also exists in two conformations, of which at least one is different from the conformations found for the apo form (fig. S3). Detailed comparison of all four structures indicated that one conformation of the holo state and one conformation of the apo state are--with the exception of the attachment of the cofactor--virtually identical. In contrast, the two remaining states (the A state for the apo form and the H state for the holo form) are distinct from each other and from the structurally identical common state (A/H form). A-state PCP generally shows the most flexible and extended three-dimensional (3D) structure having very large loop regions (Fig. 1). Helix aIII does not exist; instead, the amino acid sequence forms a large loop (loop III). Helix aI (V15 to A20) is shorter as SCIENCE VOL 312

compared with the A/H state and is reduced to only 1.5 turns. The helices aII (M49 to A53) and aIV (A76 to Y80) are reduced to only two a-helical turns, and helix aII shows a kink at position Q54. Loop III thus becomes stretched and embedded in the core of the protein between helices aII and aIV. Interestingly, a 2-ns molecular dynamics simulation (7, 8) suggests that this fixation of loop III allows the formation of an H-bond between the carbonyl of S45 and the side chain of R47. The equivalent simulation of the A/H-state PCP showed that this H-bond is eliminated in favor of a new one between S45-OH and the side chain of H44. The active site residue S45, therefore, seems to play a crucial role for the observed conformational diversity of apoTycC3-PCP. Accordingly, mutating the active site serine to alanine is sufficient to abolish any structural heterogeneity in apo-TycC3PCP, and the protein represents a completely Bfrozen[ A state (fig. S1). The orientation of the helices in the A/H state is similar to the orientation in the A state of apo-TycC3-PCP (Fig. 1). However, the helices in the A/H state are longer and more stable. Helix aI is extended from A14 to V26, helix aII from K47 to Q54, and helix aIV from I74 to Y80. The loop III now forms a very short one-turn helix aIII (L65 to A70) that is located outside of the globular protein core. This relocation of the loop III area is one of the most striking differences compared with the A state.

The major difference between the holoTycC3-PCP­specific H state and the A/H state is that the single-turn helix aIII unravels and becomes extended. As a consequence, the orientation of helix aIV is moved parallel to helix aI by approximately 3 ) (Fig. 1). The transition of loop III induces a relocation of helix aII and the region connecting helices aI and aII containing the active site residue S45 with the attached 4¶-PP cofactor. Analysis of the different conformations suggests that the transition between the H and A/H states of holo-TycC3-PCP results in a large movement of the 4¶-PP cofactor. To define these potential different states of the cofactor, we identified the chemical shifts of its two amide protons and nitrogens, NBR and NBQ. The NBQ amide proximal to the thiolgroup was detected as a well-resolved double peak, whereas the distal amide NBR showed a single very broad signal. The observed double-peak formation indicates that the 4¶-PP cofactor adopts two clearly distinct positions in holo-TycC3-PCP. In agreement with this model, a 3D 15N-edited NOESY (threedimensional 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) spectrum of completely 15N-labeled holo-TycC3-PCP, including the cofactor, revealed distinct NOE pattern for the two signals of the NBQ amide exhibiting either NOEs to the amino acids L68, F69, and probably also L65, or to V26 and probably E24 (fig. S3). Modeling of holo-TycC3-PCP combined with the analysis of these NOE patterns revealed that in the A/H state the cofactor is located close to the N terminus of the PCP, whereas in the H state it is located in the vicinity of the C-terminal end (Fig. 2). This result indicates a large movement of the 4¶-PP cofactor by È100-, resulting in an È16 ) relocation of the thiol group. To investigate the importance of these different conformations for the biological function of the PCP domain, we analyzed its interaction by NMR titration assays (9) with two cognate binding partners, the 4¶-PP transferase Sfp (10­12) that is responsible for loading the cofactor onto PCPs and the type II thioesterase enzyme (13) that is responsible for the regeneration of misprimed PCP domains. 15N-labeled TycC3-PCP was stepwise titrated with the unlabeled proteins up to a final ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 3). As expected, the 4¶-PP transferase Sfp does not interact with holo-TycC3-PCP. A titration with apo-TycC3PCP in the presence of CoA/Mg2þ immediately resulted in conversion into holo-TycC3PCP, and thus no interaction could be monitored. The titration of apo-TycC3-PCP in the absence of CoA/Mg2þ revealed a weak interaction primarily, with few residues surrounding the active site residue S45. To prevent the rapid conversion to holo-PCP by Sfp in the presence of CoA, we analyzed the interaction with the active site mutant TycC3PCPS45A (14). Again only a weak interaction was monitored in the absence of CoA. In contrast, a strong interaction with Sfp is visible in the presence of CoA/Mg2þ. The interaction site includes residues 30 to 55 of helix aII and the 4¶-PP recognition site within the loop between helix aI and aII. Only the Astate conformer is detectable with the mutant TycC3-PCPS45A, showing that Sfp specifically recognizes the A state. Guided by these titration experiments as well as mutational analysis of the Sfp­PCP interaction (15), we built a model of the complex (16, 17), starting with the crystal structure of Sfp (11) and our NMR structure of the A state of TycC3-PCP (Fig. 4). A-state PCP fits perfectly on top of CoA, which is located in a large groove in the surface of Sfp where the essential Mg2þ ion coordinates the pyrophosphate of CoA. The interface of the complex is composed of helix aII, including the loop to helix aI of A-state PCP and parts of helices aH2 and aH6, the b strands B4 and B6, and the loop region between aH6 and aH7 of Sfp (12). The reactive hydroxyl group of S45 in A-state PCP is brought into very close contact with the pyrophosphate group of CoA, putatively enabling an efficient hydrolysis and 4¶-PP transfer. This model also explains the selective interaction of the A state with Sfp. The reduction of helix aII to two turns extends the loop between helices aI and aII containing the active site residue S45, and thus makes this region more accessible for an interaction with Sfp than the more compact H and A/H conformers. Another major difference between the A and the A/H state is the conformation of the helix/loop III region. Modeling of the A/H-state PCP in complex with Sfp and CoA suggests that the formation of helix aIII in the A/H state leads to a steric hindrance of this interaction. This steric clash is removed by the unfolding of helix aIII and its embedding between helices aII and aIV. In contrast to Sfp, only a weak interaction is observable between the thioesterase SrfTEII and apo-TycC3-PCP. Based on the number and magnitude of the observed chemical shifts, the interaction is considerably enhanced with holo-TycC3-PCP and involves mainly the active site motif and the complete loop III region. Even bigger chemical shift differences are observed with the misprimed acetyl-holoTycC3-PCP derivative, indicating that the acetyl moiety plays a major role in the recognition mechanism. For this titration, we used the active site mutant SrfTEIIS86A containing a defective catalytic triad (15) to prevent the rapid hydrolysis of the acetyl residue. The interaction of SrfTEIIS86A with

holo-TycC3-PCP was identical to that of wildtype SrfTEII with holo-TycC3-PCP, suggesting that the point mutation did not affect the complex formation. Specific H-state selection by SrfTEII is evident from (i) almost no interaction with apo-TycC3-PCP that also forms the A/H state, (ii) gradually reduced A/H-state­specific signals in TROSY-HSQC spectra with increased SrfTEII concentrations, and (iii) line-shape analysis (18) of double peaks from selected residues that clearly demonstrate the shift of the preformed conformer equilibrium toward the H state upon titration with SrfTEII (fig. S4). Key recognition elements for the interaction of the H state with the SrfTEII are the loop III region, the loop containing the active site S45, and the N-terminal part of helix II. In the H state, these key recognition elements form a contiguous interaction surface, whereas in the A/H state the affected amino acid residues are distributed over a larger area and disrupted by regions not involved in complex formation (fig. S6). Again, the conformational exchange of the helix/loop III region plays a major role in creating this contiguous interaction surface. Although this region forms a short helix in the A/H state that is removed from the center of the protein, in the H state it forms a loop that is located in close proximity to the N terminus of helix aII and to the active site loop. The two conformational equilibria of the apo- and the holo form that overlap in the A/H state as a common conformer constitute a new type of regulation of a protein_s function by extending the Bpre-existing equilibrium[ hypothesis (19, 20). In our Bdouble two-state equilibrium[ model, the A and the H states represent the active conformations that are specifically recognized by the interaction partners Sfp and SrfTEII, respectively (Fig. 3). Binding of the 4¶-PP cofactor transforms the A-state equilibrium into the H-state equilibrium, altering, in particular, the conformation of the helix/loop III region that is not directly linked to the cofactor attachment site. The conformational change of this region is essential for the recognition by SrfTEII. This mechanism could therefore be interpreted as an allosteric regulation (20), although the 4¶-PP cofactor itself might additionally play a role in the recognition by SrfTEII. The TycC3-PCP double two-state equilibrium, therefore, combines the pre-existing equilibrium model that describes the equilibria within the individual apo and holo forms with the Ballosteric regulation[ model that explains the switch between the forms. The studies described in this paper have focused on binding partners that interact in trans with the PCP domain. Holo-PCP also interacts with adjacent enzymatic domains of the NRPS systems that are involved in peptide product formation, such as the amino acid adenylation and condensation domains. For the interaction with these in cis-interacting components, the location of the 4¶-PP cofactor on the PCP surface is important. The assemblyline mechanism proposed for the function of the NRPS systems requires the directed movement of this cofactor to transport the substrate between the A- and C-domains. Our results indicate that the 4¶-PP cofactor is indeed located in two distinct positions, in proximity either to the N-terminal end of holo-TycC3PCP in the A/H state or to the C-terminal end in the H state. It is tempting to speculate that the structural rearrangements in the two holoTycC3-PCP forms modulate specific interactions with the A- and C-domains. In contrast to the integrated PCP domains, type II ACPs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are isolated small acidic proteins (21, 22). NMR investigations of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis did not reveal a defined position of the 4¶-PP cofactor (21), although internal dynamics has been discussed for other ACP domains (23, 24). A non-ordered solvent exposed state of the cofactor is, however, reasonable for the efficient loading with acyl intermediates by enzymes

of the fatty acid synthetase complex that act in trans. Very recently, the crystal structures of the mammalian and fungal fatty acid synthetases were published that contain cis-acting ACP domains (25, 26). In both crystal structures, the ACP domains are not visible, most likely due to their inherent dynamics. These structures, however, also show that, in addition to the conformational flexibility (23) the entire ACP domain has to move to bridge the distance between the individual active sites. In contrast to the fatty acid synthase (FAS) system, where one ACP domain has to shuttle the substrates between multiple and distantly located catalytic centers, the PCP domains of NRPS systems transfer the substrate between an A-domain and the two neighboring Cdomains, thus potentially making the intradomain dynamics sufficient for substrate shuttling. For a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of the FAS, polyketide synthase, and NRPS systems, the characterization of the intradomain and interdomain dynamics of the PCP and ACP domains will be crucial.

Conservation of RET Regulatory Function from Human to Zebrafish Without Sequence Similarity
Shannon Fisher,1,2* Elizabeth A. Grice,1* Ryan M. Vinton,1 Seneca L. Bessling,1 Andrew S. McCallion1,3 Evolutionary sequence conservation is an accepted criterion to identify noncoding regulatory sequences. We have used a transposon-based transgenic assay in zebrafish to evaluate noncoding sequences at the zebrafish ret locus, conserved among teleosts, and at the human RET locus, conserved among mammals. Most teleost sequences directed ret-specific reporter gene expression, with many displaying overlapping regulatory control. The majority of human RET noncoding sequences also directed ret-specific expression in zebrafish. Thus, vast amounts of functional sequence information may exist that would not be detected by sequence similarity approaches. current hypothesis is that sequences conserved over greater evolutionary distances are more likely to be functional than those conserved over lesser distances (1). Many recent publications have focused attention on the regulatory potential of Bultra-conserved[ noncoding sequences, conserved across great evolutionary distances, e.g., human to fugu (2­9) EQ300 million years, or average 74% protein identity (10)^. These are frequently enhancers

associated with developmental genes, consistent with strong selective pressure to preserve critical mechanisms. Analyses of identified sequences have generally fallen into two categories: analyses confined to mammals, with functional verification done in mice, or analyses including mammalian and teleost sequences, focusing on highly conserved sequences alignable at the extremes. However, simply because an expression pattern is preserved through evolution, it does not necessarily follow that the cis-regulatory elements controlling that expression in one species will function in a second. We have explicitly tested two hypotheses: First, using selective pressure as a guide across moderate evolutionary distances, we can identify the majority of enhancers controlVOL 312 SCIENCE

ling expression at a particular locus by functional testing in a comprehensive, unbiased manner, and second, regulatory function of noncoding sequences will be conserved over evolutionary distances beyond the limit of overt sequence conservation. We have focused on the regulatory control of the gene encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. RET is expressed in neural crest, urogenital precursors, adrenal medulla, and thyroid during embryogenesis, and in specific central and peripheral neurons and endocrine cells during development and postnatally (11). Although RET expression is highly conserved across evolution (12­15), only the exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain are overtly conserved EQ70%, Q100 base pairs (bp)^ from humans to zebrafish (16­18). We first compared the genomic sequence of a È200­kilobase (kb) segment encompassing the zebrafish ret gene with the orthologous interval in fugu (Fig. 1), using AVID/VISTA (19, 20). We generated 10 ZCS (zebrafish conserved sequence) amplicons, corresponding to 14 discrete noncoding sequences (table S1). We also used these criteria to identify conserved noncoding human sequences, comparing a È200-kb segment encompassing human RET with the orthologous genomic intervals in 12 nonhuman vertebrates (16). We selected sequences shared among human and at least three nonprimate mammals (21). In total 13 HCS (human conserved sequence) amplicons, encompassing 28 discrete conserved sequences (table S2) were generated for analysis.
