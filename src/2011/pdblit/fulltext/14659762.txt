Tartrate oxidation activity was found in the crude extract of an aerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix, and the enzyme was identified as (S)-malate dehydrogenase (MDH), which, when produced in Escherichia coli, was mainly obtained as an inactive inclusion body. The inclusion body was dissolved in 6 M guanidine­HCl and gradually refolded to the active enzyme through dilution of the denaturant. The purified recombinant enzyme consisted of four identical subunits with a molecular mass of about 110 kDa. NADP was preferred as a coenzyme over NAD for (S)-malate oxidation and, unlike MDHs from other sources, this enzyme readily catalyzed the oxidation of (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)-tartrate. The tartrate oxidation activity was also observed in MDHs from the hyperthermophilic archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Archaeoglobus fulgidus, suggesting these hyperthermophilic MDHs loosely bind their substrates. The refolded A. pernix MDH was also crystallized, and the structure was determined at a resolution of 2.9 Å. Its overall structure was similar to those of the M. jannaschii, Chloroflexus aurantiacus, Chlorobium vibrioforme and Cryptosporidium parvum [lactate dehydrogenase-like] MDHs with root-mean-square-deviation values between 1.4 and 2.1 Å. Consistent with earlier reports, Ala at position 53 was responsible for coenzyme specificity, and the next residue, Arg, was important for NADP binding. Structural comparison revealed that the hyperthermostability of the A. pernix MDH is likely attributable to its smaller cavity volume and larger numbers of ion pairs and ion-pair networks, but the molecular strategy for thermostability may be specific for each enzyme. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction (S)-Malate dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.37, MDHs) catalyze the reversible conversion between (S)-malate, also known as L-malate, and oxaloacetate with strict substrate specificity in the presence of NAD or NADP. Because these enzymes play crucial roles in the citric acid cycle and malate/aspartate shuttle, the biochemical and structural properties of MDHs from eukaryal, bacterial and archaeal sources have been studied extensively [1­4]. MDHs and lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) are members in a large family of dehydrogenases, which can be divided into three sub-families [5]: dimeric MDH, tetrameric LDH and [LDH-like] MDH, whose primary and quaternary structures are similar to those of LDHs. Several archaeal MDHs from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius [6], Thermoplasma acidophilum [7], Haloarcula marismortui [8], Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af) [9,10],

Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mj) [10,11] and Pyrobaculum islandicum [12] have been characterized. These enzymes all belong to the [LDH-like] MDH sub-family and are homotetramers with a subunit molecular mass of 33­37 kDa, except for A. fulgidus MDH, which is a dimer due to the absence of the sequence that mediates the dimer­ dimer interaction [10]. Among these enzymes, the crystal structures of those from H. marismortui, A. fulgidus and M. jannaschii have already been determined [13­16]. Aeropyrum pernix is a strict aerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from a coastal thermal vent in Japan [17]. Its genome was originally sequenced in 1998 [18] and reannotated in 2006, yielding 1700 open reading frames in the sequence [19]. All enzymes comprising the citric acid cycle, including MDH, are annotated in the genome database, though functional and structural information on these enzymes remains limited. At the outset of this study, we found an enzyme having strong activity toward (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)tartrate with NAD(P) and identified it as an MDH. Almost all MDHs show a high degree of specificity for (S)-malate, but some also show oxidative activity toward other substrates. For instance, MDHs from

bovine heart mitochondria, Pseudomonas testosteroni, Moraxella lwoffi and Rhodobacter capsulatus can oxidize (2S,3R)-tartrate, (2S,3S)tartrate and/or (S)-2-hydroxyglutarate [20­23], though at lower rates. Because there have been no previous reports of an MDH having strong catalytic activity toward tartrate, we endeavored to express the gene in Escherichia coli and characterize the enzyme produced. In this paper, we describe the refolding of the A. pernix MDH (ApeMDH) produced as an inclusion body in E. coli and the biochemical properties of the refolded enzyme. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of this enzyme at a resolution of 2.9 Å, analyzed important residues for coenzyme and substrate binding, and compared the structure with those of other [LDH-like] MDHs to evaluate the structural features responsible for its high thermostability. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Screening for dehydrogenase activity in A. pernix A. pernix was cultivated aerobically for 48 h at 90 °C, as described previously [24]. The cells were then collected by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min), washed with 3% NaCl, suspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and disrupted by sonication. After another centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 10 min), the supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and used as the crude extract. Screening for dehydrogenase activity was performed at 50 °C using a microplate reader system (Benchmark, BioRad). The reaction mixture (0.2 ml), which contained 50 mM glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 9.0), 10 mM substrate and the crude extract, was pre-incubated for 3 min at 50 °C, after which the reaction was started by addition of 1 mM NAD(P), and the increase of absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for 30 min. 2.2. Gene cloning and expression of MDH from A. pernix We initially carried out PCR to amplify an ApeMDH gene fragment using the following primer pair: 5-GGGACAGCATATGATAACAATAC3, containing a unique NdeI restriction site overlapping the 5 initial codon, and 5-TGGTTGGATCCTTACTCTCTGAGCTG-3, containing a unique BamHI restriction site proximal to the 3-end of the termination codon. Chromosomal DNA from A. pernix was isolated as previously described [25] and used as the template. The amplified 0.9-kb fragment was confirmed from its sequence, digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET11a expression vector (Novagen) linearized with NdeI and BamHI, yielding pET/ApeMDH. 2.3. Protein expression, refolding and purification of ApeMDH E. coli BL-21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) were transformed with pET/ApeMDH, after which the transformants were cultivated for 8 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 g/ml ampicillin. Expression was then induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl--D-thiogalacto-pyranoside to the medium, and cultivation was continued for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min), washed with 0.85% NaCl, suspended in 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) buffer and lysed by sonication. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 4% Triton X-100, incubated at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged again. This procedure was repeated twice. The resultant pellet was washed twice with Milli Q water and then solubilized in the 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl and 6 M guanidine­HCl. The solubilized ApeMDH (200 mg of enzyme in 200 ml solution) was added to refolding buffer (1.5 L of 0.1 M Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.4 M L-arginine) and then incubated for 36 h at 4 °C. The resultant enzyme solution (1.7 L)

containing the refolded ApeMDH was concentrated to a volume of 50 ml, dialyzed against 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl, and then subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (2.6 × 60 cm, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris/ HCl (pH7.5) buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and used for biochemical and structural experiments. All solutions used for the refolding procedures were filtered through 0.45-m membrane filter (Advantec) to remove dust and any other impurities. 2.4. Enzyme assay and determination of protein concentration MDH activity was determined spectrophotometrically using a Shimadzu UV-1200 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostat. All assays were performed at 50 °C. The standard reaction mixture (1 ml) consisted of 100 mM glycine/NaOH (pH 10.0), 50 mM (S)malate, 1 mM NAD(P) and the enzyme. The appearance of NAD(P)H was monitored from the absorbance at 340 nm (extinction coefficient  = 6.22 mM- 1·cm- 1). For the kinetic analyses, various concentrations of (S)-malate (0.05 to 2 mM with NAD and 0.02 to 0.5 mM with NADP), (2S,3S)-tartrate (0.5 to 10 mM with NAD and 10 to 200 mM with NADP) or (2S,3R)-tartrate (0.2 to 5 mM with NAD and 2 to 50 mM with NADP) were used in the presence of 4 mM NAD or 1 mM NADP. In addition, various concentrations of NAD (0.2 to 5 mM) and NADP (0.005 to 0.1 mM) were used in the presence of 2 and 0.5 mM (S)-malate, respectively. The turnover number (kcat) and apparent Km values were estimated from Lineweaver­Burk plots. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin serving as the standard [26]. The concentration of ApeMDH protein during purification was determined by the absorption at 280 nm (1% absorption coefficient A280 = 6.23 cm- 1) calculated from the amino acid sequence of the protein [27]. 2.5. Electrophoresis and determination of molecular mass Native-PAGE was carried out on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel using the method of Davis [28], after which the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Active staining was performed at 50 °C using a mixture containing 300 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM (S)malate, 0.1 mM p-iodonitrotetrazorium violet, 0.04 mM phenazine methosulfate and 0.25 mM NAD(P). SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 15% polyacrylamide gel using the method of Leammli [29] with protein markers from Bio Rad serving as the standards. The molecular mass of the native ApeMDH was determined by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography using 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.2 M NaCl as the elution buffer. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) were used as the molecular mass standards (GE Healthcare). 2.6. Crystallization, X-ray data collection, structure determination, refinement and structural analysis The crystallization conditions were screened using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method with Wizard 1, 2 (Emerald Biosystems) and Crystal Screen 1, 2 (Hampton Research). Drops (2 l) of protein solution (8.9 mg/ml) were mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution and equilibrated against 0.15 ml of reservoir solution at 20 °C. The crystals (ca. 0.1 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm) were grown for 2 weeks in the reservoir solution, which was comprised of 0.1 M CHES (pH9.5) and 40% PEG 600. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on an R-AXIS VII detector system using an in-house rotating copper anode generator (Micromax 007, Rigaku) operating at 40 kV and 20 mA. The crystal belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121

respectively. Model geometry was analyzed with PROCHECK [36], and 91.1% of the non-glycine residues were in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot and 8.9% were in the additionally allowed region (Table 1). The final coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (2d4a). The Dali server (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server/) was used for the structural homology search. Ion pair interactions within the structures were identified using the WHAT IF web server [37] with a cut-off distance of 4.0 Å [38] between oppositely charged residues. Solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) was defined as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of a protein [39] and was calculated using AREAIMOL (ccp4 interface). The overall protein volume and volumes of the cavities within the structure were analyzed using SwissPDBViewer. Molecular graphics figures were created using PyMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net/). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Screening for novel dehydrogenases We screened for novel dehydrogenases from A. pernix using a microplate reader system. About 110 types of L- and D-amino acids, organic acids, sugars, alcohols and amines were tested as substrates. Among these, dehydrogenase activity was detected with L-glutamate, (S)-malate, (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)-tartrate. Because L-glutamate and (S)-malate dehydrogenases are well-known enzymes [24], we focused on an enzyme having strong activity toward tartrate. Through several chromatography steps, we succeeded in purifying the enzyme and identifying its N-terminal amino acid sequence as MITILGAGKV. This indicated the encoding gene to be APE_0672.1, whose product was predicted to be an MDH. MDH activity was also detected with the purified enzyme, confirming it to be an MDH. This ApeMDH catalyzed the oxidation of both (S)-malate and tartrate in the presence of NAD (P). This was noteworthy, as many of the MDHs identified so far show strict substrate specificity for (S)-malate. In the present study, therefore, we endeavored to characterize ApeMDH. 3.2. Gene expression and refolding of recombinant ApeMDH In the E. coli transformants, ApeMDH was present in both the soluble and insoluble fractions, but was found mainly as an inclusion body. The MDH activity in the soluble fraction was unaffected by incubation at 90 °C for 10 min, confirming that APE_0672.1 does indeed encode a hyperthermostable MDH. However, the protein in the soluble fraction migrated as an aggregate in native-PAGE (data not shown). Since this aggregation could not be prevented by changing of cultivation temperature or the conditions under which the cells were disrupted, we decided to carry out refolding of the inclusion body. To accomplish this about 20 g of cells (wet weight) were disrupted by sonication, and the precipitant fraction was washed with buffer

with the following unit cell parameters: a = 78.17 Å, b = 84.01 Å, c = 216.15 Å, and  =  =  = 90°. A heavy atom derivative was prepared by soaking the crystal in a reservoir solution containing 1 mM di--iodobis(ethylendiamine)diplatinum (II) nitrate (PIP). The data were processed using HKL2000 [30]. Native and platinum data sets were used for phase calculation, which was carried out using the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method with SOLVE [31]. The SIRAS map at 2.9 Å was subjected to maximum-likelihood density modification, followed by autotracing using RESOLVE [32]. The initial model was built using Xtalview [33], and refinement to a resolution of 2.9 Å was carried out using Refmac5 [34] and CNS [35]. Then after several cycles of inspection of the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc density maps, the model was rebuilt. The final R and Rfree were calculated to be 20.5 and 24.0%,

containing 4% Triton X-100 as described in Materials and methods. The protein in the washed inclusion body was over 95% pure, as judged from the SDS-PAGE (data not shown), and the amount of the protein solubilized by guanidine­HCl was estimated to be about 200 mg, as judged from the absorbance at 280 nm. The refolded enzyme catalyzed malate dehydrogenation, indicating that the active ApeMDH was successfully recovered from the inclusion body. After further purification by gel chromatography, the mobility of the refolded ApeMDH in native-PAGE was the same as that of the natural ApeMDH (data not shown). With this procedure, about 70 mg of purified ApeMDH were obtained from 2 L of culture. 3.3. Biochemical properties of ApeMDH The subunit molecular mass of ApeMDH was determined to be about 34 kDa, which coincided with that calculated from the amino acid sequence (33,489 Da). Using gel filtration chromatography, the molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined to be 110 kDa, which indicates the enzyme is a homotetramer, like most other archaeal MDHs (the A. fulgidus enzyme is an exception). When we examined the effect of temperature on the enzyme's activity, we found that the activity increased as the temperature was increased from 50 to 95 °C, suggesting that the optimum temperature for activity is above 95 °C. The optimum pH for malate oxidation was determined to be pH 11. The enzyme retained full activity after heating at 100 °C for 10 min, and when heated at 50 °C for 30 min the enzyme showed no loss of activity at pHs between 5.5 and 10.5. Collectively, these findings indicate that the recombinant enzyme was properly refolded and that ApeMDH is a highly stable MDH, like AfMDH and MjMDH [9,11]. We next examined the coenzyme and substrate specificities of ApeMDH. Both NAD and NADP were able to serve as the coenzyme for ApeMDH when (S)-malate was the substrate (Table 2). The coenzyme specificity of several other archaeal MDHs have been reported: AfMDH and P. islandicum MDH are NAD-specific [9,12], whereas MjMDH and S. acidocaldarius MDH have dual coenzyme specificity [6,11]. In this respect, ApeMDH is similar to the latter two enzymes. ApeMDH also catalyzed the oxidation of (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)-tartrate using NAD or NADP as the electron acceptor. Notably, the activity toward (2S,3S)-tartrate was three times higher than that toward (S)-malate in the presence of NADP (Table 2). (R)-Malate, (2R,3R)-tartrate and (S)lactate were inert as substrates. To our knowledge, no other MDHs with strong reactivity toward tartrate have been reported. The MDHs from P. testosteroni, M. lwoffi and R. capsulatus are known to oxidize (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)-tartrate, but the reaction rates are less than 1% of the (S)-malate oxidation rate [21-23]. Thus, ApeMDH is the first example of an MDH exhibiting significant reactivity for tartrate oxidation. We also examined tartrate oxidation catalyzed by two other archaeal MDHs, AfMDH and MjMDH, which we produced in E. coli as described previously [10,11]. After partially purifying the two enzymes by heat treatment at 80 °C for 20 min, we checked their ability to catalyze NAD(P)-dependent tartrate dehydrogenation and found that AfMDH catalyzed both (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)-tartrate oxidation, while MjMDH catalyzed oxidation of (2S,3S)-tartrate but not (2S,3R)tartrate. This means that at least archaeal MDHs in the [LDH-like] MDH family are not specific for (S)-malate. We next determined the kcat and apparent Km values for each substrate (Table 2). For (S)-malate oxidation, the kcat value (2.6 ± 0.02 s- 1) with NAD was about two times higher than that (1.4 ± 0.04 s- 1) with NADP, but the apparent Km value (0.12 ± 0.09 mM) for (S)-malate was six times higher in the presence of NAD than with NADP (0.019 ± 0.003 mM). The apparent Km values for NAD and NADP in (S)-malate oxidation were determined to be 0.87 ± 0.05 (kcat: 2.8 ± 0.03 s- 1) and 0.0076 ± 0.0003 mM (kcat: 1.6 ± 0.04 s- 1), respectively, indicating that the enzyme has a higher affinity for NADP than NAD.

With NADP, the kcat/Km values for other substrates were quite lower than that for (S)-malate because of the low kcat and high Km values. Thus ApeMDH utilizes (S)-malate and NADP as the preferred substrate and coenzyme, respectively. As with ApeMDH, (S)-malate is the preferred substrate of MjMDH and AfMDH (Table 2). In this study, we found that the relative activities of the A. pernix, M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus MDHs toward tartrate were fairly high; in particular, the kcat values for NADP-dependent (2S,3S)-tartrate oxidation by ApeMDH and MjMDH were two times higher than those for (S)-malate. By contrast, the kcat/Km values for (2S,3S)-tartrate for the two MDHs were about 1/400 and 1/30 of those for (S)-malate due to the much higher Km values for (2S,3S)-tartrate. We also used the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/) to investigate whether these organisms have enzymes related to tartrate metabolism, but could find no enzyme similar to oxaloglycolate reductase (decarboxylating, E.C.

1.1.1.92), tartrate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.93), (2S,3R)-tartrate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.3.1.7), tartrate dehydratase (E.C. 4.2.1.32), tartrate epimerase (E.C. 5.1.2.5) or tartrate epoxidase (E.C. 3.3.2.4). These observations suggest tartrate oxidation by these MDHs is not biologically important. The hyperthermophilic archaeal MDHs may merely have a loosely fitted structure for substrate binding, which enables them to catalyze the oxidation of tartrate as well as (S)-malate.

3.4. Structure of ApeMDH We initially used the molecular replacement method for phase calculation based on the structure of Chloroflexus aurantiacus MDH (PDB ID: 1uxj), which showed the highest sequence homology with that of ApeMDH, but could not obtain useful data. As an alternative, SIRAS was used for determination of the crystal structure of ApeMDH,

The secondary structural assignments for ApeMDH are shown above the alignment. Strands, -helices and short helices are labeled as S1­S8, H1­H8 and G1­G3, respectively. To be consistent with most other published studies on LDH and [LDH-like] MDH, we used the residue numbering devised by Eventoff et al. [41], which is shown under the alignment. The residues between 209 and 227 could not be numbered due to disparity between the two structures. The amino acid numbers mentioned in the text are also shown using the same numbering system.

and the structure was refined to a resolution of 2.9 Å (Table 1). The asymmetric unit consisted of four protein molecules (Fig. 1A) with a solvent content of 53.2%, which corresponds to a Matthew's coefficient [40] of 2.6 Å3 Da- 1. In the present model, only subunit D contained all the residues (1­308). Amino acids 79­87 and 308 in subunit A, 79­85 in subunit B, 81­88 and 308 in subunit C were disordered and were not visible in the electron density map. Consequently, the present description of the subunit structure is based on subunit D. Each molecule contained two domains: an Nterminal dinucleotide binding domain (residues 1­139) with the classical Rossmann fold composed of a parallel six-stranded -sheet

(1­6) and four -helices (1­4), and a C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 140­308) with four -helices (5­8) and two antiparallel twisted -strands (7 and 8) (Fig. 1B). When we sent the model for the ApeMDH monomer to the Dali server seeking proteins with a similar structure (as of April 4, 2008), the structure of ApeMDH was found to be quite similar to those of other [LDH-like] MDHs; the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of the C atoms was between 1.4 and 2.1 Å. Unexpectedly, however, ApeMDH showed greater similarity to the eukaryal [LDH-like] MDH from Cryptosporidium parvum (CpMDH; 1.4 Å RMSD with 40% sequence identity; PDB ID: 2hjr) and the bacterial [LDH-like] MDHs

from thermophilic C. aurantiacus (CaMDH; 1.5 Å with 39% sequence identity; PDB ID: 1guy) and mesophilic Chlorobium vibrioforme (CvMDH; 1.4 Å with 39% sequence identity; PDB ID: 1gv1) than to archaeal [LDH-like] MDHs from halophilic H. marismortui (1.9 Å with 32% sequence identity; PDB ID: 1d3a), hyperthermophilic A. fulgidus (1.8 Å with 33% sequence identity; PDB ID: 1ojs) and hyperthermophilic M. jannaschii (2.1 Å with 32% sequence identity; PDB ID: 1hyg). The greater structural similarity of ApeMDH to Cp, Ca and Cv MDHs may reflect the presence of greater numbers of amino acid insertions and deletions throughout the sequences of archaeal MDHs than are found in Cp, Ca and Cv MDHs (Fig. 2). 3.5. Coenzyme and substrate binding To be consistent with most of the published studies on LDH and [LDH-like] MDH, the structure of ApeMDH was superposed with that

of pig LDH (PDB ID: 5ldh), and the residue numbering devised by Eventoff et al. [41] is shown in Fig. 2. In this system, the numbering of the ApeMDH sequence was started at 23, and residues between 209 and 227 could not be numbered due to disparity between the two structures. The amino acid numbers mentioned refer to this numbering system. Although the present structure was determined with the apo form of the enzyme, structure-based alignment of ApeMDH with the aforementioned MDHs enabled us to compare the amino acid residues involved in coenzyme and substrate binding (Fig. 2). Within the ApeMDH sequence, Ala is present at position 53. This residue is replaced by Gly in MjMDH, and the corresponding residue is replaced by Asp in the other MDHs, which are all NAD-specific. This is to be expected, as Asp or Glu is present at this position in most NADspecific enzymes to prevent the binding of NADP(H) [42]. It is also consistent with the observation that, like MjMDH [11], ApeMDH shows dual coenzyme specificity. In addition to the substitution at the position 53, Lee et al. pointed out that Ser29B, Arg54, His54B and Ser55 of MjMDH are responsible for the binding of NADP [15]. We ascertained that the side chain of Arg54 of ApeMDH was situated near the 2-phosphate group of the adenosine ribose moiety of NADP, like that of MjMDH (Fig. 3A). The orientation of the side chain hydroxyl group of ApeMDH Thr55 was also similar to that of MjMDH Ser55. In other NAD-specific MDHs (see Fig. 2), these residues are replaced by non-polar residues such as Ile, Val and Ala. This suggests that interactions between these residues, especially Arg54, and the 2-phosphate group of adenosine ribose moiety of NADP make important contributions to the enzyme's binding ability. Residues corresponding to Ser29B and His54B of MjMDH were not found in ApeMDH (Fig. 2), suggesting that both of these residues are rather less important for NADP binding. The active site residues [15,43], Arg102, Arg109, Asp168, Arg171 and His195 were completely conserved in ApeMDH (Fig. 2). Among

these residues, Arg102 is necessary for binding the dicarboxy substrate and plays a key role in distinguishing the substrate specificities of MDHs and LDHs [43]. In order to determine how tartrate fits into the active site, we built a substrate binding model of ApeMDH using the structure of human malate-NAD-MDH (PDB ID: 2dfd) (Fig. 3B). The arrangement of four residues (Arg102, Asp168, Arg171 and His195) around the malate binding site of the ApeMDH was identical to that of human MDH. On the other hand, Arg109 of ApeMDH was shifted 4.3 Å toward opposite side of the malate, as compared to the corresponding residue in human MDH. This may reflect the difference between the apo form of ApeMDH and the holoform of human MDH, and a similar observation was made when the structures of binary and ternary complexes of porcine cMDHs were compared [43]. Despite this detailed analysis, no significant information on the manner in which tartrate binds within the substrate binding pocket was obtained. 3.6. Structural features underlying thermostability We compared the structural features of ApeMDH with those of other tetrameric thermostable MDHs, including MjMDH and CaMDH and mesophilic CvMDH and CpMDH to evaluate the structural features responsible for its high thermostability. Because the structural features of the H. marismortui MDH likely reflect its resistance to high salt concentrations, and AfMDH forms a dimer, their structures were not included in this analysis. In general, a smaller ASA, a smaller overall volume and a smaller cavity volume each serve to increase the thermostability of a protein [44,45]. Contrary to our expectation, the total ASAs for tetrameric and monomeric ApeMDH were similar to those of CaMDH, CvMDH and CpMDH, as were the volumes of these enzymes, and these values were rather larger in MjMDH than in the other MDHs (Table 3). By contrast, large differences in cavity volume were found between the two hyperthermophilic MDHs and the other MDHs. Although the number of cavities in ApeMDH was not very different from the numbers in CaMDH and CpMDH, and was two times larger than the number in MjMDH, the maximum volumes of the ApeMDH and MjMDH cavities were markedly smaller than those of the CaMDH and CvMDH cavities. In addition, the total volumes of the cavities in the two hyperthermophilic MDHs were also significantly smaller than those in CaMDH and CvMDH (Table 3). In the hyperthermophilic MDHs, therefore, it appears that a smaller cavity volume makes an important contribution to the overall thermostability. Recent studies of the structures of hyperthermophilic proteins have shown that the number of ion pairs and the formation of ion-pair networks can also make important contributions to thermostability [46,47]. Using a cut-off distance of 4.0 Å between oppositely charged residues, we calculated that ApeMDH and MjMDH contain 111 and 154 ion pairs, respectively, whereas CaMDH, CvMDH and CpMDH contain only 78, 98 and 64, respectively. Numbers of intrasubunit ion pairs are also smaller in the moderately thermophilic and mesophilic MDHs; however, the manner in which ion pairs formed between subunits was dependent on the MDH type (Table 3). The numbers of ion-pair networks formed by over four residues were significantly larger in the two hyperthermophilic MDHs than in other moderately thermophilic and mesophilic MDHs. This means that formation of ion pairs and ionpair networks undoubtedly strengthen the hyperthermostability of MDHs. We next compared the structural features of the two hyperthermophilic MDHs. Thermal transition between active and inactive MjMDH reportedly starts after incubation at 80 °C for 15 min [11]. On the other hand, ApeMDH remained stable after incubation at 100 °C for 10 min in the present study, which, despite the different assay conditions, indicates ApeMDH is more thermostable than MjMDH. When we compared the structural features of ApeMDH and MjMDH (Table 3), we noticed that the

ASAs of the tetramer and monomer, the protein volume, and the maximum volume of a cavity were all somewhat smaller in ApeMDH than in MjMDH. To varying degrees, these differences could be responsible for the higher thermostability of ApeMDH, despite the fact that the total volume of the cavities in ApeMDH is larger than in MjMDH. The total number of ion pairs in ApeMDH was markedly smaller than in MjMDH, but the numbers of ion-pair networks were about the same for the two enzymes. In ApeMDH, the most extensively formed ion-pair network (a five-residue network) was observed at the interface between the A­C (or B­D) subunits. With regard to the A­C interface, a symmetrical ion-pair network was observed among: A-Asp75:C-Arg263:C-Arg267:CGlu259:C-Arg43 (Fig. 4). By contrast, no ion-pair interactions could be found in the corresponding region of MjMDH, where the network was mainly formed between the A­B (or C­D) subunits. This indicates that while larger numbers of ion-pair networks may contribute to the thermostability of both hyperthermophilic MDHs, the molecular strategy for increasing thermostability via ion-pair formation may differ between the two. In this study, we determined the functional and structural characteristics of the apo form of ApeMDH. To date, MDHs from various sources have been crystallized, and several structures have been determined in complex with NAD(P)H. Nevertheless, the structural information available on the ternary complex with bound substrate and coenzyme remains very limited [43]. In particular, there is presently no information available on the ternary complex of [LDHlike] MDHs. In this study, we constructed a substrate binding model of ApeMDH, but could not obtain informative data on the manner in which tartrate was bound. Analysis of the ternary structure of the tartrate­NAD(P)­ApeMDH complex at higher resolution may give us the answer. Therefore, our next goal is the structural determination of ApeMDH in complex with a substrate and coenzyme. We anticipate that this will provide critical information that will further our understanding of the substrate-recognition mechanism of the [LDH-like] MDHs.
