Abstract--Structure-based design and synthesis of the 3,4 0 -bispyridinylethylene series led to the discovery of 3-isoquinolinylpyridine 13a as a potent PKB/Akt inhibitor with an IC50 of 1.3 nM against Akt1. Compound 13a shows excellent selectivity against distinct families of kinases such as tyrosine kinases and CAMK, and displays poor to marginal selectivity against closely related kinases in the AGC and CMGC families. Moreover, 13a demonstrates potent cellular activity comparable to staurosporine, with IC50 values of 0.42 and 0.59 lM against MiaPaCa-2 and the Akt1 overexpressing FL5.12-Akt1, respectively. Inhibition of phosphorylation of the Akt downstream target GSK3 was also observed in FL5.12-Akt1 cells with an EC50 of 1.5 lM. The X-ray structures of 12 and 13a in complex with PKA in the ATP-binding site were determined. Ó 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Kinase inhibitors have generated considerable interest due to the remarkable success of Gleevec and other inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (TKs) in clinical oncology.1 As one of the major downstream targets of several receptor TKs in the signal transduction pathways, Akt (PKB) plays a central role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival.2 Akt is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the AGC family of kinases.3 It is overexpressed and constitutively activated in a large number of human tumors.2f Antisense inhibition of Akt has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in several cancer cells.4 All of these findings have recently led to an intense search for small molecule inhibitors of Akt as anticancer agents.5 In the preceding paper,

we reported a novel series of Akt inhibitors that contain the 3,4 0 -bispyridinylethylene core (1) resulting from structural modifications of a screening lead.6 We report herein our continued optimization efforts of the 3,4 0 bispyridinylethylene series that has led to the identification of 3-isoquinolinylpyridine 13a as a potent PKB/Akt inhibitor with an IC50 of 1.3 nM against Akt1 (Fig. 1). Syntheses of the alkyne (2) and 3-arylsubstituted pyridines 6­9 and 13 are outlined in Scheme 1. Sonogashira coupling of 146 with TMS-acetylene followed by deprotection of the TMS group with TBAF produced acetylene 15, which underwent the Heck reaction with selected aryl bromides to give 2. Conversion of 14 to the 3-arylpyridines (6­9 and 13) proceeded via the Stille or Suzuki reactions with corresponding tin or boronic acid coupling partners. The analogs (3­5 and 7) with double bond replacements were prepared as described in Scheme 2. Amide 3 was prepared in a three-step sequence involving palladiumcatalyzed carboxylation of 14, coupling of the resulting 16 with 4-aminopyridine and deprotection with TFA. Palladium-catalyzed amination of bromide 14 with benzophenone imine following the procedure developed by Buchwald et al.,7 and subsequent acid hydrolysis provided amine 17. Coupling of 17 with pyridinecarboxylic acids in the presence of EDC and subsequent deprotection of the Boc group with TFA afforded amide 4. Conversion of amine 17 to pyridinylmethylamine 5 was achieved through reductive amination of pyridine-carbaldehydes and subsequent TFA deprotection. Pd-catalyzed amination of bromide 14 followed by deprotection furnished compound 7. Preparation of the conformationally constrained analogs is illustrated in Schemes 3­5. Compound 10 with C-b of the double bond cyclized with C-2 of the central pyridine was synthesized as depicted in Scheme 3. Bromoisatin 19 reacted with bromopyruvic acid 20 in aqueous KOH solution to form the cinchoninic acid, which underwent decarboxylation in refluxing nitrobenzene8 to provide bromohydroxy-quinoline 21.

10 from 21 was carried out using the same three-step protocol as described in Scheme 1. Ullmann coupling between dibromopyridine 23a and phenol 24a at 240 °C under microwave conditions gave ether 25a. Palladium-catalyzed amination of aminopyridine 23b with triflate 24b provided aniline 25b. Compounds 25a­b were converted to amines 26 as previously described followed by acid hydrolysis. Reductive amination of 26 with N-Boc-tryptophanal in the presence of NaBH3CN and Ti(i-PrO)4 and subsequent acidic deprotection of the Boc group provided compounds 11a­b (Scheme 4). Preparation of analogs cyclized between C-b and C-4 of the central pyridine is shown in Scheme 5. PMB protected bromopyridine 27b (made from 27a) was converted to 3-Boc-aminopyridine 28 via the amination protocol as previously described followed by Boc protection in

the terminal pyridine binds to the hinge region via a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Val123, while the nitrogen of the central pyridine hydrogen bonds to the amino group of Lys72. Although the terminal pyridine is tightly sandwiched between the isopropyl group of Leu173 and the methyl group of Ala70, there is available space surrounding the trans-double bond linking the two pyridines. Therefore, our initial efforts focused on replacing the double bond with other functional groups (Table 1). Substitution of the double bond with a triple bond (2a) resulted in sharply lowered activity. The lost activity in linear acetylene 2a cannot be regained with an angled 3-pyridinyl group (2b). The bioisosteric amide analogs (3a, 4a­b) are much less active than the corresponding double bond analogs (1a­b). These results are consistent with the highly hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket. All other double bond replacements including the methylamine (5a­b), amine (7a­d) ortho-phenyl (6a), and 2,4-thiazole (6b­c) groups (Table 1) resulted in a significant loss in activity. Bispyridine 8a (Table 1), which has the double bond deleted, shows better than expected activity. Its IC50 value of 260 nM is respectable considering that the pyridine is further away from the hinge. A series of 3-arylpyridines were therefore prepared with functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding attached to the aryl rings (Table 2). Some of these compounds should presumably fit in the binding pocket better than 8a and an additional hydrogen bond with the hinge is therefore possible. Unfortunately, none of the compounds in Table 2 shows improved activity to 8a, except for 9m, which has an IC50 of 227 nM. We speculate that the lack of van der Waals interactions with Ala70 and Leu173 for these analogs (9a­x), as seen for 1b, may contribute partially to the poor activity. Having been unsuccessful in replacing the trans-double bond, we next investigated structures resulting from cyclizations of the trans-double bond onto the adjacent pyridines. This approach also restricts the number of rotatable bonds and hence has the potential to increase potency. As shown in Figure 1, there are four possible ways to cyclize the double bond onto either the central or terminal pyridine. Note that in the X-ray structure in complex with PKA, 1 adopts the conformation shown in Figure 1. In order to cyclize C-b with C-2 (10a), the single bond connecting C-a has to rotate 180° to a less favorable conformation. The resulting analog 10a is 21-fold less active than 1b (Table 3). Replacing the 4pyridine moiety in 10a with a 3-pyridine imparts an additional 24-fold drop in activity (10b). Activity also decreased sharply for analogs 11a­b incorporating cyclizations between C-b and C-5 0 . Cyclization between C-b and C-4 appears to be more favorable. The resulting naphthyridine (12) shows improved potency as compared with compounds 10 and 11, but is still 14-fold less potent than 1b. Finally, cyclization between C-a and C-3 0 led to a breakthrough Akt1 inhibitor 13a, which is 10-fold more potent than 1b with an IC50 of 1.3 nM. Compound 13a possesses one less rotatable bond than 1b, and it contains an isoquinoline group that provides stronger van der Waals interactions with the hydropho-

Compound 32 was treated with HCl to remove the PMB group and the resulting phenol was coupled to Boc-tryptophanol via the Mitsunobu reaction. Finally, acidic deprotection of the Boc group yielded 12.

Overall, compound 13a demonstrates excellent selectivity against distinct families of kinases including TK and CAMK,3 and possesses IC50 values greater than 5 lM against most of these kinases. However, selectivity against closely related kinases of the AGC3 and CMGC3 families is poor to moderate because of the high degree of homology in the ATP-binding pocket.

Similar to 1b, 13a largely displays no selectivity for any of the three Akt isoforms, presumably due to very high sequence homology, especially in the ATP-binding pocket where the homology is nearly 100% (except one non-crucial amino acid in Akt3). For similar reasons, 13a is non-selective against PKA (IC50 = 2.1 nM). Selectivities versus other closely related kinases such

as PKC, CDK, and ERK2 are moderate, ranging from 77- to 500-fold. Compound 13a was evaluated for its antiproliferative activity against FL5.12-Akt1 murine prolymphocytic cells that overexpress Akt1 and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells.6 Its IC50 values of 0.42 and 0.59 lM against the Akt1 overexpressing FL5.12-Akt1 and MiaPaCa-2, respectively, represent approximately a 10-fold improvement over 1b, and are comparable with that of staurosporine (Table 4). These improvements in cellular potency for 13a are in agreement with the same comparable increases in enzymatic activity observed relative to

1b. Compound 13a also inhibits the phosphorylation of the Akt downstream target GSK3 in FL5.12-Akt1 cells with an EC50 of 1.5 lM.6 The X-ray structures of 12 and 13a in complex with PKA in the ATP-binding site have been determined (Fig. 2).9 The binding pattern of 13a is almost identical to that of1b.6 The nitrogen of the isoquinoline binds to the hinge via a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Val123 ° with a distance of 3.0 A between the two nitrogens. The pyridine of the isoquinoline is sandwiched between the isopropyl group of Leu173 and the methyl group of Ala70, while the benzene ring of the isoquinoline is in a

hydrophobic pocket defined by amino acid residues of Val57, Ala70, Val104, Met120, Leu173, and Thr183. C-1 of the isoquinoline is buried deep inside the binding ° cavity with a distance of merely 3.2 A between C-1 and the carbonyl group of Glu121, leaving little space for any group larger than hydrogen atom. Interestingly, if the C-1 hydrogen of the isoquinoline were capable of hydrogen bonding, it might be a perfect fit. The nitrogen of the central pyridine hydrogen bonds to the amino group of Lys72 (distance between the nitrogens is ° 2.8 A). The charged primary amine of the side chain sits tightly in the Mg-binding loop, binding to Asn171 and Asp184 via H-bonds and ionic interactions. The indole ring packs underneath the glycine-rich loop with an aver° age distance of 3.5 A to the loop. Note that the entrance to the ATP-binding pocket near the hinge region is partially blocked by residues 315­327 of the C-terminal domain. The nearest distance from the isoquinoline to Phe327 is ° approximately 3.5 A, enabling the isoquinoline of 13a to fit tightly in the hinge region. Overlay of structures of 12 and 13a (Fig. 2b) in complex with PKA revealed that 12 binds similarly to 13a, except that the side chain of 12 is forced into an unfavorable position due to the clash between H-5 of the isoquinoline and H-a of the side chain (Fig. 1). This change leads to weakened hydrogen bonding interactions of the primary amino group with Asn171 and Asp184. The distances of the hydrogen bonds are in sub-optimal ° lengths of 3.4 and 4.1 A, respectively. In comparison, ° the primary amino group of 13a is positioned 2.9 A equally from the above residues. In summary, structure-based design and synthesis of the 3,4 0 -bispyridinylethylene series of Akt/PKB inhibitors led to the discovery of 3-isoquinolinylpyridine 13a, which exhibits an IC50 of 1.3 nM against Akt1. Compound 13a shows excellent selectivity against distinct families of kinases such as TK and CAMK, and displays poor to marginal selectivity against closely related kinases in the AGC and CMGC families. Moreover, 13a demonstrates potent cellular activity comparable to staurosporine. Inhibition of the phosphorylation of the Akt downstream target GSK3 by 13a was also observed in FL5.12-Akt1 cells. With the available X-ray structures of the Akt inhibitors in complex with PKA, further structural refinements of this series via structure-based design to optimize the physiochemical and biological properties of molecules is ongoing, the results of which will be published in due course.10 Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Mr. Rick Clark, Dr. Moshe Weitzberg, Dr. Matt Hensen, Dr. Robert Keyes, Dr. Curt Cooper, and Dr. Chris Krueger for proofreading and valuable suggestions.

PKA and Akt inhibitors (12 and 13a) were co-crystallized in a solution containing PKA (20 mg/mL) and PKI peptide.6 The structures were determined and refined to resolutions of ° ° 3.0 A for 12 (Rwork = 22.97% and RFree = 31.61%) and 2.0 A for 13a (Rwork = 28.26% and RFree = 32.28%). Crystallographic data described in this paper have been deposited with PDB (ID 2F7Z for 12 and 2F7E for 13a). 10.
