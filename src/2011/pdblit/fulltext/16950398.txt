Short Article

Summary Retroviral assembly is driven by multiple interactions mediated by the Gag polyprotein, the main structural component of the forming viral shell. Critical determinants of Gag oligomerization are contained within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the capsid protein, which also harbors a conserved sequence motif, the major homology region (MHR), in the otherwise highly variable Gag. An unexpected clue about the MHR function in retroviral assembly emerges from the structure of the zinc finger-associated SCAN domain we describe here. The SCAN dimer adopts a fold almost identical to that of the retroviral capsid CTD but uses an entirely different dimerization interface caused by swapping the MHR-like element between the monomers. Mutations in retroviral capsid proteins and functional data suggest that a SCAN-like MHR-swapped CTD dimer forms during immature particle assembly. In the SCAN-like dimer, the MHR contributes the major part of the large intertwined dimer interface explaining its functional significance. Introduction All internal structural proteins of retroviruses are encoded by the viral gag gene and are initially translated as a Gag polyprotein precursor, which plays the central role in retroviral assembly. Even when expressed in the absence of all other virally encoded components, Gag proteins were shown to be sufficient for formation of virus-like particles (Adamson and Jones, 2004; Scarlata and Carter, 2003). After assembly and release of the viral particle from the infected cell, the virus undergoes maturation during which Gag is cleaved into several fragments by the viral protease leading to prominent

rearrangements in the internal structure of the virion. Traditionally, the modules within full-length Gag are named after the products of its proteolytic processing during maturation. In HIV-1, for example, Gag is cleaved into four major fragments: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and p6 along with two smaller spacer peptides SP1 and SP2, which are arranged in MA-CASP1-NC-SP2-p6 order within the 55 kDa Gag precursor. Numerous interactions mediated by these domains within full-length Gag drive the assembly of the immature viral particle, which involves Gag oligomerization, membrane targeting, association with other viral components, and host cell factors and, finally, budding and release from the cell. Extensive functional data on the role of different Gag domains in retroviral assembly have been recently reviewed elsewhere (Adamson and Jones, 2004; Scarlata and Carter, 2003). Atomic-level detail of Gag oligomerization is inferred from structural studies on various Gag fragments, because high-resolution data on the full-length Gag within the shell of the immature viral particle are not available. Although sequence conservation of Gag proteins is generally low, the threedimensional structures of Gag modules from different retroviruses are highly homologous, suggesting common functional mechanisms. A critical but poorly understood role in retroviral assembly is played by the capsid protein, which contains two independently folded domains connected by a flexible linker. The general consensus from numerous genetic studies is that critical assembly determinants are contained within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the capsid (Adamson and Jones, 2004; Scarlata and Carter, 2003). Deletions, insertions, and point mutations in the CTD result in severe defects in viral assembly. On the other hand, a minimal 16 kDa HIV-1 Gag construct that contains an intact CTD-SP1 segment but carries significant deletions or substitutions within all other domains is still capable of forming virus-like particles (Accola et al., 2000). Several entities within the CTD appear to contribute to its critical role in retroviral assembly, but the exact mechanism of their involvement remains unknown. First, the CTD contains a dimerization function. The mature capsid protein of HIV-1 and its isolated C-terminal domain were shown to dimerize in solution with similar affinity, and the model of the CTD dimer is based on the crystal structure of HIV-1 CTD, which reveals a dimer interface formed by almost parallel packing of two symmetry-related helices of the two monomers (Gamble et al., 1997). In contrast to HIV-1, structurally homologous capsids of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) (Jin et al., 1999), of human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) (Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999), and of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (Campos-Olivas et al., 2000) all appear to be monomeric in solution up to concentrations of 1 mM. Although CTD dimerization is consistent with the structural role of the capsid protein in the core of the mature virus (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2004; Li et al., 2000), the function of the CTD dimer in the assembly of the immature particle is still puzzling. Mutations of the dimer inter-

face residues of HIV-1 CTD measurably reduce viral particle production but do not completely block it, suggesting that CTD dimerization may be important for the stability of the viral shell, but not for the assembly per se (von Schwedler et al., 2003). Alternatively, the capsid protein may undergo a conformational change during assembly, as is indicated by the changes in the binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitopes within the capsid protein (Gross et al., 2000). Recent assembly models suggest that assembly-competent Gag dimerization may involve additional interactions mediated by the N-terminal domain of the capsid (Ma and Vogt, 2004; Nandhagopal et al., 2004). Importantly, the C-terminal domain of the capsid protein contains a conserved segment, known as the major homology region (MHR), in the otherwise highly variable Gag polyprotein (Wills and Craven, 1991). Apart from the cysteine-histidine boxes of the nucleocapsid, this stretch of approximately twenty amino acids is the only other Gag segment conserved across different genera of retroviruses and in some retrotransposons. Viral replication is extremely sensitive to mutations in this region. Although subtle MHR mutations have no effect on assembly but, rather, block replication at a distinct step in the viral life cycle, the more disruptive MHR mutants demonstrate pronounced defects in Gag oligomerization and immature particle production (Craven et al., 1995; Mammano et al., 1994; Orlinsky et al., 1996; Strambio-de-Castillia and Hunter, 1992). Conserved MHR residues form an extensive hydrogen-bonding network stabilizing the MHR fold, which consists of an extended strand followed by a turn and an helix and is highly conserved in all known retroviral capsid structures (Campos-Olivas et al., 2000; Gamble et al., 1997; Jin et al., 1999; Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999). In the model of CTD dimerization, this part of the structure is not directly involved in the dimer interface (Gamble et al., 1997), and the mechanism of its function in the viral life cycle is still unknown. An unexpected clue about the MHR role in the function of the capsid C-terminal domain emerges from the NMR structure of the zinc finger-associated SCAN domain reported in this article. Proteins containing C2H2-type zinc fingers are present throughout the animal kingdom and are known to have undergone independent expansions within major eukaryotic lineages. The C2H2 proteins frequently contain additional protein domains located at their N termini, including the KRAB, the BTB/ POZ, and the SCAN domain (Collins et al., 2001). The SCAN domain is vertebrate specific, and more than 70 SCAN domains were identified in the human genome by using bioinformatics approaches (Sander et al., 2003). Remarkably, the few SCAN-like domains present in lower vertebrates are not associated with C2H2 zinc fingers but are predicted to be in large retrovirus-like polyproteins (Sander et al., 2003). The SCAN domain functions as an interaction domain, mediating self-association or selective association with other proteins (Williams et al., 1999). The isolated SCAN domain was shown to form a stable dimer in solution (Stone et al., 2002). To elucidate its function, we determined the three dimensional structure of the isolated SCAN dimer from the human ZNF174 protein.

Results and Discussion Solution Structure of the ZNF174 SCAN Dimer The structure of ZNF174 SCAN domain was solved with multidimensional solution state NMR spectroscopy (Figures 1A and 1B). Specialized NMR methods are normally required to resolve homodimer interfaces, because it is challenging to distinguish intermonomer from intramonomer contacts (Walters et al., 2001). The topology of the SCAN dimer interface was elucidated by a differential-labeling NMR technique that relies on mixing completely deuterated, 15N-labeled protein with protonated unlabeled protein. In the 15N NOESY spectra of the mixed dimer (Figures 1C and 1D), all crosspeaks between NH and aliphatic protons must be intermonomer contacts (Walters et al., 1997). Such intermonomer distance restraints were crucial and sufficient to unambiguously resolve the topology of the SCAN dimer (see Experimental Procedures). Structural statistics data are shown in Table 1. Consistent with the sequence-based predictions, the SCAN domain encompasses an independently folding protein module with five distinct helical segments in each monomer (Figure 1E). The short N-terminal helix, which we call helix H0, is followed by an extended strand and a turn segment. Two longer helices H1 and H2 form a major part of the extensive dimer interface with helix H1 packed against helix H2 of the other monomer and vice versa. Additional dimer contacts are provided by residues in the extended strand and turn preceding helix H1, notably tyrosine Tyr54 extends across the dimer interface to form part of the hydrophobic core between helices H3 and H4. SCAN Is Related to Retroviral Capsid CTDs In lower vertebrates, SCAN-like domains appear in polyproteins, which are reminiscent of the characteristic Gag-Pol structure present in retroviruses and highly related long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (Sander et al., 2003). Remarkably, the search of the Protein Data Bank with the SCAN structure as a template in a DALI structural homology search (Holm and Sander, 1995) revealed an unexpected similarity of the SCAN domain to C-terminal domains of retroviral capsid proteins. This was the only significant structural homology identified among all known protein structures. Despite the absence of any detectable amino acid sequence homology, the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein (Gamble et al., 1997), for example, exhibits essentially the same structure as the SCAN domain of ZNF174 (Figures 2A and 2B), although with a largely different dimerization interface (see below). Both proteins contain a characteristic extended strand and turn followed by helices H1 and H2 packed against each other at a similar angle, followed by helices H3 and H4 with a hydrophobic core between them. An aromatic residue close to the turn region (Tyr54 in SCAN and Phe161 in HIV-1 CTD) is similarly extended into the hydrophobic cluster between helices H3 and H4. Moreover, retroviral CTDs and SCAN-like domains in lower-vertebrate polyproteins are located in practically the same position in the Gag polyprotein, preceding the characteristic CCHC zinc knuckle motif of the nucleocapsid domain (Figure 2C). In the example shown in Figure 2C, a SCAN-like domain,

which has approximately 35% amino acid sequence identity with the ZNF174 SCAN, appears in a polyprotein that has the features of the Ty1/copia family of retrotransposons. This family of LTR retrotransposons, also known as Pseudoviridae, has an inverted order of the reverse transcriptase and the integrase domains in the pol gene when compared to other known retrotransposons and retroviruses (Peterson-Burch and Voytas, 2002). The SCAN structure provides a compelling example of the ability of retroelements to achieve structural (and presumably functional) conservation of the Gag modules with very limited or virtually absent conservation of their amino acid sequence. In contrast to lower vertebrates, the majority of SCAN domains in mammals have become associated with C2H2 zinc fingers, although in the human genome, there is still one example

of a SCAN domain appearing in a large retroelementlike open reading frame (KIAA 1925) (Sander et al., 2003). These observations suggest that the modern SCAN domain is a descendant of the CTD-like domain of an LTR retrotransposon or a retrovirus. Adding to the variety of ways in which retrotransposable elements may have shaped the human genome, the SCAN structure suggests a remarkable example of a Gag-contained domain taking on a new cellular function.

SCAN Is a Domain-Swapped Homolog of HIV-1 CTD Given the high structural homology between the SCAN domain and the HIV-1 CTD and that both domains appear to function as dimerization modules, it is interesting to compare the structures of the two dimers (Figure 3A). The relative orientation of the helices in the two dimers is very similar. Helices H2, H3, and H4 pack against each other in an almost identical way, and helix H2 makes similar dimer contacts with the symmetry related helix H2 of the other monomer. The main difference between the two structures is the placement of the MHR-like segment relative to helices H2, H3, and H4. In the SCAN structure, this module formed by the N-terminal extended strand, turn and helix H1 (Figure 2B), packs against helices H2, H3, and H4 of the opposite monomer, whereas it forms intramonomer contacts with the equivalent helices in the HIV-1 CTD structure (Figure 3A). Thus, the SCAN domain is a domain-swapped dimer version of the HIV-1 capsid structure, forming a much larger dimer interface. Notably, the MHR-like fold plays the dominant dimerization role in the SCAN structure (Figures 3A and 3B). Three-dimensional domain swapping is the event in which two or more monomers exchange a structural element to form an intertwined dimer or a higher-order oligomer (Bennett et al., 1994). The structure of the subunits in such an oligomer is very similar to the monomeric structure with the exception of the linker region connect-

ing the swapped structural element with the rest of the protein. Numerous observations of domain-swapped dimers formed in protein crystals have been reported, although examples of biological relevance of this phenomenon are still few (Rousseau et al., 2003). Most remarkably, domain swapping was observed in the structurally unrelated capsid of a rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), a member of the plant icosahedral virus group, where it was demonstrated to increase stability of the viral particle (Qu et al., 2000).

Implications of the SCAN Structure for Retroviral Assembly Extensive functional data available for retroviral capsid proteins strongly suggest that the domain-swapped dimer observed in the SCAN structure may be relevant for retroviral assembly. The domain-swapped dimer, in which the MHR fold forms a major part of the CTD dimer interface, would provide a simple explanation of the MHR role in the immature particle assembly and clarify a number of puzzling observations. For example, residues

The conformational restraints imposed by these interactions destabilize the monomeric form of CTD and drive the subsequent formation of the tight domain-swapped CTD dimer. Abbreviations: capsid N-terminal domain, NTD; spacer peptide 1, SP1; otherwise same as previously indicated.

Trp184 and Met185 of HIV-1 capsid form a major portion of the dimer interface in the existing model of CTD dimerization (Figure 3B), and their mutations to alanine completely disrupt the relatively weak dimer interaction of the isolated HIV-1 capsid protein in solution (Gamble et al., 1997). However, although these mutations measurably diminish immature viral particle production, they do not completely block it (von Schwedler et al., 2003). In a SCAN-like domain-swapped dimer of HIV capsid, these residues would form only a minor part of the dimer interface, and it is plausible that their mutation is permissive. Importantly, the domain-swapped dimer would explain why point mutations of the MHR hydrophobic residues result in impaired efficiency of Gag assembly (Mammano et al., 1994; Orlinsky et al., 1996; Strambiode-Castillia and Hunter, 1992), which was difficult to explain with the current model of the capsid-CTD dimer. Other interesting mutations that block Gag assembly include residues Lys158 and Asp197 in the HIV-1 capsid (von Schwedler et al., 2003). These two residues are ° only 5 A apart in the HIV-1 CTD crystal structure (Figure 3B), suggesting that in the domain-swapped conformation they may form a critical salt bridge across the dimer interface. An additional puzzle involves the role of the two conserved cysteines C198 and C218, which form a disulfide link in the HIV-1 CTD structure. Mutation of C218 to serine results in virtual elimination of particle assembly; in contrast, the C198S mutant assembles normally but has reduced infectivity (McDermott et al., 1996). These residues appear reduced in fresh preparations of HIV-1 virions from culture (McDermott et al., 1996) and in the solution structure of the HTLV-1 capsid (Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999), and it was speculated that they may participate in an oxidative control of the CTD function (Khorasanizadeh et al., 1999; Worthylake et al., 1999). In the domain-swapped structure, the two cysteines would be located at the dimer interface, suggesting that the disulfide bond formation may have a direct steric effect on the affinity of CTD dimerization (Figures 3A and 3B). Finally, the dimerization function of the MHR fold observed in the SCAN structure is supported by the conservation of the MHR sequence across the wide spectrum of retroviruses and their hosts. For example, conservative mutations Gln155Asn and Glu159Asp of the MHR residues in the HIV-1 capsid result in severe reduction of immature particle production. These conserved residues form part of an extensive hydrogenbonding network that stabilizes the MHR fold of viral CTDs (Gamble et al., 1997). Such structural stability of the swapped structural element may facilitate domain swapping by providing an easier kinetic access to the domain-swapped structure (Rousseau et al., 2003; Schlunegger et al., 1997), because two MHR elements could be exchanged without their partial unfolding. In this respect, it is interesting that mutations of the conserved MHR residues affect conformational stability and self-association of the isolated HIV-1 CTD (Mateu, 2002). Significantly, the side chain of Gln155 adopts an unusual buried conformation in the HIV-1 CTD structure by forming a hydrogen bond bridge between the backbone carbonyl of Glu155 and the backbone amide of Asn195. In the domain-swapped structure, this hydrogen bond

bridge would extend across the dimer interface and constitute a critical dimer contact (Figures 3A and 3B). In the context of the full-length Gag polyprotein, the MHR-swapped CTD dimer is likely to be promoted by additional Gag-Gag interactions, which may explain why the domain-swapped conformation has not been observed in available structures of isolated C-terminal domains or of mature capsid proteins. In the full-length Gag, the CTD conformation is coupled to steric restraints imposed by Gag-Gag interactions outside of the CTD, because formation of the SCAN-like domain° swapped dimer requires a major translocation ( 30 A) and reorientation of the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of the CTD (Figure 3A). Given that interactions mediated by regions both preceding and after the CTD in the Gag polyprotein were shown to be important for immature particle assembly (Adamson and Jones, 2004; Scarlata and Carter, 2003) and that in HIV-1 MHR-mediated protein-protein interactions appear to function subsequently to RNA or membrane binding (Provitera et al., 2001), it is natural to suggest a two-step model of CTD dimerization during viral assembly (Figure 3C). In such a model, Gag-Gag contacts formed prior to CTD dimerization destabilize the monomeric form of CTD and promote the domain-swapped dimer. Interestingly, important determinants of Gag oligomerization are located in the C terminus of the CTD, which is disordered in all available capsid structures, and also in the SP1 peptide, which connects the CTD and the nucleocapsid domain (Accola et al., 1998; Liang et al., 2003). Our model of CTD dimerization suggests that this segment of Gag may act as an important structural lever coupling interactions mediated by the NC with the CTD conformation. Nucleocapsid is also believed to play a fundamental role in Gag dimerization, because the function of NC in promoting assembly can be efficiently mimicked by nucleocapsid substitution with a leucine zipper dimerization domain (Accola et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 1998). This raises an intriguing possibility that NC-mediated dimerization is required to promote the intertwined domain-swapped dimer of the capsid C-terminal domain and that the CTD-SP1 junction is important for productive coupling of these two distinct dimerization events. Collectively, these observations suggest that formation of the capsid domain-swapped dimer of the type observed in the SCAN structure may represent a key step in the assembly of the immature viral particle and that this conserved interaction may serve as an attractive target for future antiretroviral treatment strategies.
Experimental Procedures Preparation of ZNF174 SCAN Domain Recombinant isolated SCAN domain (residues 37­132) of human ZNF174 protein was overexpressed and purified as described in detail elsewhere (Stone et al., 2002). Initial 15N-HSQC spectra of the wild-type recombinant SCAN domain revealed numerous peak doublets that were mainly due to cis-trans isomerization of Pro111. Although a conserved residue, leucine does occur at this position in some SCAN family members. The structural studies were performed on the Pro100Glu, Pro111Leu double mutant, which removed complications because of multiple conformations. Pro100 is not a conserved SCAN domain residue, and glutamic acid frequently occurs at this position.

NMR Spectroscopy Backbone assignment were obtained from three pairs of triple resonance experiments: HNCA/HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CB/HN(COCA)CB, and HNCO/HN(CA)CO. Side chain assignments were done by analyzing H(CCO)NH, C(CO)NH, and HCCH TOCSY experiments combined with additional data from 13C-NOESY, 15N-NOESY, and 15N-Tocsy. Distance restraints were calculated from the volumes of the NOE crosspeaks in 13C-NOESY, 15N-NOESY, and 2D NOE experiments. Intermonomer contacts in the dimer were obtained as previously described (Walters et al., 1997). Briefly, completely deuterated 15 N-labeled protein sample was prepared. This sample was mixed with a sample of unlabeled protein and dimer exchange performed by heating the sample to 60 C for 15 min. In the exchanged sample, NOE crosspeaks of the 15N-NOESY spectrum must be intermonomer NOEs (Figures 1C and 1D). The total of twenty backbone amides displayed intermonomer contacts. Fourteen of the twenty were located on helices H1 and H2, marking the helical surfaces of the dimer interface and simplifying the assignment of the crosspeaks. The total of 29 crosspeaks were assigned and proved sufficient to unambiguously determine the relative arrangement of the four central helices of the dimer interface. Structure Calculations The CANDID automated peak assignment and structure calculation routine of the CYANA software package (Herrmann et al., 2002) was used to assign the majority of the NOE-derived distance restraints and to produce a well-converged structure of the dimer. The 29 intermonomer distance restraints, 115 dihedral angle restraints from TALOS program (Cornilescu et al., 1999), and 44 -helical hydrogen bonds per monomer were used as the initial restraints in the calculation. The structure calculation failed to converge without the manually supplied intermonomer restraints. The resulting structure was validated by manually forcing alternative helical arrangements in CANDID. Only one well-converged solution with good peak assignment statistics was found possible. All protein structure figures in this report were prepared with MOLMOL molecular visualization program (Koradi et al., 1996).
