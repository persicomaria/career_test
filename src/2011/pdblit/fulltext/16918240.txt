The conformation of the crotonaldehyde-derived N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct in the oligodeoxynucleotide 5-d(G1C2T3A4G5C6X7A8G9T10C11C12)-3,5-d(G13G14A15C16T17C18G19C20T21A22G23C24)3, where X ) N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG, is reported. This adduct arises from opening of the cyclic N2-(S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct when placed opposite dC in duplex DNA. This oligodeoxynucleotide contains the 5-CpG-3 sequence in which the N2-(R-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano2)-dG but not the N2-(S-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct preferentially formed an interstrand carbinolamine cross-link [Kozekov, I. D., Nechev, L. V., Moseley, M. S., Harris, C. M., Rizzo, C. J., Stone, M. P., and Harris, T. M. (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 50-61; Cho, Y.-J., Wang, H., Kozekov, I. D., Kurtz, A. J., Jacob, J., Voehler, M., Smith, J., Harris, T. M., Lloyd, R. S., Rizzo, C. J., and Stone, M. P. (2006) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 19, 195-208]. Analysis of 1H NOE data, chemical shift perturbations, and deoxyribose pseudorotations and backbone torsion angles suggested the presence of a stable and ordered DNA conformation at pH 9.3 and 30 °C, with minimal conformational perturbation. The spectral line widths of the adduct protons were comparable to those of the oligodeoxynucleotide, suggesting that the correlation times of these protons were similar to those of the overall duplex. The crotonaldehydicderived methyl protons showed NOEs in the 5-direction to C18 H1, G19 H1, and G19 H4 in the complementary strand of the duplex. The aldehyde proton of the adduct exhibited NOEs in the 3-direction to A8 H1 and A8 H4 in the modified strand. All of these NOEs involved DNA protons facing the minor groove. Molecular dynamics calculations, restrained by distances and torsion angles derived from the NMR data, revealed that within the minor groove, the aldehyde of the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]dG adduct oriented in the 3-direction, while the 1(S) methyl group oriented in the 5-direction. This positioned the aldehyde distal to the G19 exocyclic amine and provided a rationale as to why the N2-(SR-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct generated interstrand cross-links less efficiently than did the N2-(R-R-CH3--OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct. Introduction
Crotonaldehyde 1, an R, -unsaturated aldehyde, is genotoxic and mutagenic in human lymphoblasts (1). It induces liver tumors in rodents (2). Michael addition of crotonaldehyde to deoxyguanosine yields the enantiomeric R- and S-R-CH3--OH1,N2-propano-2-deoxyguanosine adducts 2a and 2b (Scheme 1) (3-6); a second DNA adduction pathway yields paraldolreleasing DNA adducts (7), primarily N2-(3-hydroxybutylidene)dG (8). Adducts 2a and 2b are also formed through the reaction of acetaldehyde, a mutagen and potential human carcinogen (9),

with deoxyguanosine (6, 10). The R- and S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adducts 2a and 2b were detected in human and rodent tissues (11, 12). In humans, these probably result from various endogenous and exogenous exposures, including lipid peroxidation (11, 13, 14), exposure to tobacco smoke (15, 16), and exposure to N-nitrosopyrrolidine (17, 18). The site-specific synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides containing cyclic adducts 2a or 2b (19-21) enabled their chemistry and biology to be examined in duplex DNA. When adducts 2a or 2b were placed into oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes at 5CpG-3 sequences, Kozekov et al. (22) trapped interstrand saturated three carbon cross-links by treatment with NaCNBH3, corroborating the reports of Wang et al. (6, 8). Significantly, cross-linking efficiency was dependent upon the stereochemistry of the adduct, favoring the R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a, as opposed to the S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b. However, both the R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a and the S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b readily formed N-terminal conjugates with the peptide

KWKK (23). This implied that both the adducts 2a and 2b underwent opening to the corresponding aldehydes 3a or 3b when placed opposite dC in duplex DNA, but only aldehyde 3a efficiently formed interstrand DNA cross-links in the 5CpG-3 sequence. A series of stable isotope-edited NMR experiments showed that crotonaldehyde-derived adduct 2a yielded carbinolamine cross-link 5a, with the corresponding imine 6a and pyrimidopurinone 7a cross-links remaining below the level of detection (24). Molecular modeling suggested that interstrand cross-links arising from the R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct introduced less disruption into the duplex than did those arising from the S-R-

CH3--OH-PdG adduct, due to differing orientations of the Rand S-CH3 groups. Moreover, for the R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a, the methyl group was predicted to orient in the 3direction in the minor groove, facilitating formation of carbinolamine cross-link 5a. In contrast, the lower efficiency of interstrand cross-linking observed for the S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b in the 5-CpG-3 sequence might be attributed to the unfavorable orientation of the methyl group in the 5-direction within the minor groove, hindering reaction between aldehyde 3b and the targeted dG in the complementary strand (24). In the present work, the conformation of the crotonaldehydederived N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 2b is reported

To derive distance restraints, spectra were recorded consecutively using TPPI phase cycling with mixing times of 150, 250, and 350 ms. The data were recorded with 1024 real data points in the t1 dimension and 2048 points in the t2 dimension covering 9615.385 Hz. The relaxation delay was 2 s. The data in the t1 dimension were zero-filled to give a matrix of 2K × 2K real points. NOESY spectra for observation of exchangeable protons were recorded at 13 °C using a cryogenic probe, in 90:10 H2O:D2O, using a field gradient Watergate pulse sequence (26) for water suppression. The data were collected using States-TPPI phase cycling with mixing times of 200 and 250 ms. A squared sine-bell with 72° shift apodization was applied in the t2 dimension while cosine-squared bell apodization was applied in the t1 dimension. A total of 1536 real data points in the t2 dimension and 512 points in the t1 dimension were used with 128 scans. Double quantum-filtered 1H correlation (DQFCOSY) (27, 28) and exclusive COSY (E-COSY) (29) spectra were collected at 25 °C at 500.13 MHz and zero-filled to give a matrix of 1024 × 2048 real points. E-COSY spectra were collected with 2048 complex points in the acquisition dimension and 512 points covering 6009.615 Hz and then zero-filled to 1024 points. For each t1 increment, 64 or 84 scans were averaged with presaturation of the HDO resonance. A skewed sine-bell square apodization function with a 90° phase shift and a skew factor of 1.0 was used in both dimensions. Chemical shifts of proton resonances were referenced to water. NMR data were processed on Silicon Graphics Octane workstations using NMRPipe (30) and assigned using FELIX2000 (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). Experimental Restraints. 1. Distance Restraints. Footprints were drawn around cross-peaks for the NOESY spectrum measured at a mixing time of 250 ms to define the size and shape of individual cross-peaks, using the program FELIX2000. Identical footprints were transferred and fit to the cross-peaks obtained at the other two mixing times. Cross-peak intensities were determined by volume integration of the areas under the footprints. The intensities were combined with intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of a starting DNA structure to generate a hybrid intensity matrix (31). The program MARDIGRAS (version 5.2) (32, 33) was used to refine the hybrid matrix by iteration to optimize the agreement between the calculated and the experimental NOE intensities. The molecular motion was assumed to be isotropic. The noise level was set at the intensity of the weakest cross-peak. Calculations were performed using the DNA starting models generated using the program INSIGHT II (Accelyris, Inc.), NOE intensities derived from experiments at three mixing times, and with three c values (2, 3, and 4 ns), yielding 18 sets of distances. Analysis of these data yielded the experimental distance restraints and standard deviations for the distance restraints used in subsequent restrained molecular dynamics calculations. For partially overlapped cross-peaks, the upper bounds on the distances were increased. The lower bounds were set at 1.8 Å with the exceptions of the hydrogen bond restraints and the distance between X7 H and A8 H1. 2. Torsion Angle Restraints. Pseudorotational angles (P) of the deoxyribose rings were estimated by monitoring the 3JHH couplings of sugar protons (34). The JH1-H2 and JH1-H2 couplings were measured from the E-COSY experiment (29), while the intensities of JH2-H3 and JH3-H4 couplings were determined from the DQFCOSY experiment. The data were fit to curves relating the coupling constants to the deoxyribose pseudorotation (P), sugar pucker amplitude (), and the percentage S type conformation. The pseudorotation and amplitude ranges were converted to the five dihedral angles 0 to 4. Restrained Molecular Dynamics. The adduct was constructed at X7 using the BUILDER module of INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Inc.). The A- and B-DNA structures were energy-minimized by the conjugate gradients method for 250 iterations using the AMBER 8.0 force field without experimental restraints to relieve any bad van der Waals contacts with a constant dielectric. The restraint energy function included terms describing distances and dihedral restraints as square-well potentials. The Generalized Born solvent model was used for rMD SA calculations with 0.1 M salt

NMR studies at pH 9.3 reveal that within the minor groove, the aldehyde of adduct 2b orients in the 3-direction, while the 1(S)methyl group orients in the 5-direction. This positions the aldehyde distal to the G19 amino group hindering formation of the 5-CpX-3 interstrand cross-link, as predicted by molecular modeling (24). The minor groove orientation of the adduct conserves Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding. The conformation of the adduct provides a rationale as to why the N2-(S-R-CH3-OH-1,N2-propano-2)-dG adduct generates interstrand crosslinks less efficiently than does the N2-(R-R-CH3--OH-1,N2propano-2)-dG adduct.

Materials and Methods
Oligodeoxynucleotide Synthesis. The preparation of oligodeoxynucleotides containing site-specific -OH-PdG and R-CH3-OH-PdG adducts was as described (19-21). All commercially obtained chemicals were used as received. Methylene chloride was freshly distilled from calcium hydride. Anhydrous THF was freshly distilled from a sodium/benzophenone ketyl. All reactions were performed under argon atmosphere. Glassware was oven dried and cooled under argon. Concentrations of the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were determined from calculated extinction coefficients at 260 nm (25). The purities of the modified oligodeoxynucleotides were analyzed using a PACE 5500 capillary electrophoresis (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) instrument. Electrophoresis was conducted using an eCAP ssDNA 100-R kit applying 12000 V for 30 min. The electropherogram was monitored at 254 nm. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured on a Voyager-DE (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) instrument in negative reflector mode. The matrix contained 0.5 M 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and 0.1 M ammonium citrate. The concentration of the single-stranded oligonucleotides was determined from the extinction coefficients of 11.3 × 104 and 11.1 × 104 cm-1, respectively, at 260 nm. NMR. Experiments were carried out at 1H frequencies of 500.13 or 800.19 MHz. The S-R-CH3--OH-PdG-modified oligodeoxynucleotide was annealed with its complement in a buffer consisting of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0). The duplex oligodeoxynucleotide was prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in 0.25 mL of 99.996% D2O. After adjusting the pH at 9.3, the sample was placed into a micro-NMR tube (Shigemi Glass, Inc., Allison Park, PA). 1H NOESY experiments in D2O were conducted at 30 °C. For each t1 increment, 32 scans were averaged

1022 Chem. Res. Toxicol., Vol. 19, No. 8, 2006 concentration, and the SHAKE algorithm was on for the fixed hydrogen bond length (35, 36). The nonbonded pair list was updated if any atom moved more than 0.5 Å, and the cutoff radius for nonbonded interactions was 10 Å. The effective energy function included terms describing distance and dihedral restraints, in the form of square-well potentials. The partial charges assigned to the adduct by RESP protocol are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Calculations were initiated from A- and B-DNA starting structures by coupling to a heating bath, with a target temperature of 600 K. The force constants were 32 kcal mol-1 Å-2 for empirical hydrogen bonding, torsion angle restraints, and NOE restraints. The target temperature was reached in 2.5 ps and was maintained for 2.5 ps. The molecules were cooled to 100 K over 15 ps for equilbrium dynamics. Coordinate sets were archived every 0.2 ps, and 10 structures from the last 5 ps were averaged. This average rMD structure was subjected to 500 iterations of conjugate gradient energy minimization to obtain the final structure. The final structure was analyzed using AMBER to measure rmsd values with the converged structures. Back-calculation of theoretical NMR intensities from the emergent structures was performed using the program CORMA (version 5.2) (31). Helicoidal parameters were examined using the program 3DNA (37).

Results
When S-R-CH3-OH-PdG adduct 2b was placed opposite dC in 5-d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3,5-d(GGACTCGCTAGC)-3 at 37 °C, the presence of aldehyde 3b and hydrated aldehyde 4b, in equilibrium with cyclic adduct 2b, was immediately detected by NMR, as reported (24). Thus, opening of cyclic adduct 2b occurred rapidly. At pH 7, the opening of adduct 2b to aldehyde 3b and its hydrate 4b was incomplete at equilibrium (24). At pH 9.3, 1H NMR revealed that equilibrium strongly favored the conversion of adduct 2b to aldehyde 3b and its hydrate 4b; moreover, at pH 9.3, the duplex remained sufficiently stable for the present NMR studies. At pH 9.3, aldehyde 3b existed in equilibrium with its hydrate 4b; thus, the NMR spectra showed resonances arising from both species, as well as a trace of the cyclic adduct 2b. However, the duplex oligodeoxynucleotide containing the S-stereoisomer of N2-(3-oxopropyl)-dG aldehyde 3b was sufficiently stable at pH 9.3 to provide excellent NMR data. Assignments of DNA Protons. 1. Nonexchangeable Protons. The sequential NOE connectivity between the aromatic and the anomeric protons of the modified oligodeoxynucleotide duplex, assigned using standard methods (38, 39), is shown in Figure 1. A complete NOE connectivity was observed for both strands of the duplex. This was indicative of a stable and ordered DNA conformation at pH 9.3 and 30 °C. These assignments were expanded into other regions of the 1H NOESY spectrum to yield complete 1H assignments for the H2, H2, H3, and H4 protons (38, 39). The assignments of the nonexchangeable protons are detailed in Table 1 of the Supporting Information. 2. Exchangeable Protons. An expanded view of the far downfield region of the 1H NOESY spectrum, showing the resonances arising from the Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded imino protons, is shown in Figure 2. For aldehyde adduct 3b, the imino resonance arising from the C6,G19 base pair was assigned at 12.7 ppm, the X7,C18 base pair was assigned at 12.6 ppm, and the A8,T17 imino resonance was assigned at 13.8 ppm, all within the anticipated chemical shift ranges. Imino proton resonances arising from the terminal base pairs G1,C24 and C12, G13 were not observed, presumably due to rapid exchange with solvent. The presence of a measurable amount of the diol adduct 4b in equilibrium with aldehyde adduct 3b was demonstrated by the presence of the cross-peak at 12.4 ppm. This resonance

Expanded plot of the 500 MHz 1H NOESY spectrum acquired at 13 °C at a mixing time of 200 ms showing sequential 1H NOE connectivities for the imino protons for base pairs C2,G13 to C11, G14 for N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b.

protons of the adjacent C6,G19 and A8,T17 base pairs. It also exhibited an NOE to the CH3 protons of the crotonaldehyde adduct, the latter of which was shifted approximately 0.1 ppm with respect to the crotonaldehyde CH3 resonance arising from aldehyde 3b. A complete set of sequential NOEs was observed for the oligodeoxynucleotide containing aldehyde 3b, indicating the conservation of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding at base pairs C6,G19, X7,C18, and A8,T17. Sequential assignment of the amino protons (40) from base pairs C2,G23fC11,G14 was obtained. Each of the peaks identified in the amino region exhibited a cross-peak with the appropriate imino proton as expected for Watson-Crick base pairing. N2-[3-Oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG Adduct. The adduct protons of adduct 3b were assigned from a combination of 1H COSY and NOESY experiments (Figure 3). The crotonaldehyde-derived CH3 resonance, observed at 0.99 ppm, exhibited a COSY cross-peak to a resonance at 3.83 ppm, assigned as arising from the HR proton. The HR proton exhibited an additional COSY cross-peak to a resonance at 2.38 ppm. Likewise, in the NOESY spectrum, the HR proton also exhibited a cross-peak to the resonance at 2.38 ppm. Accordingly, this resonance was assigned as arising from a superposition of the H ,  proton resonances. The H aldehyde proton resonance was identified at 9.6 ppm. The aldehyde proton exhibited NOESY cross-peaks to H , , HR, and CH3 protons and a COSY crosspeak to the H ,  protons. The spectral line widths of the adduct protons were comparable to those of the oligodeoxynucleotide, suggesting that the correlation times of these protons were similar to those of the overall duplex. Chemical Shift Perturbations. Chemical shift differences between the aldehyde adduct 3b and the unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide were localized at the adducted base pair X7,G18 and the 5- and 3-neighboring base pairs C6,G19 and A8,T17, respectively. The largest perturbations were observed for the minor groove deoxyribose H1 resonances arising from the adducted nucleotide X7, A8 in the modified strand, and nucleotides G18 and G19 in the complementary strand. Of these, the greatest perturbation was less than 0.3 ppm. The chemical shifts of the aromatic base protons were essentially unchanged. Adduct DNA NOEs. Five NOEs were observed between the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b and nonexchangeable DNA protons, shown in Figure 4. The crotonaldehyde-

derived methyl protons observed at 0.99 ppm showed NOEs in the 5-direction to C18 H1, G19 H1, and G19 H4 in the complementary strand of the duplex. The aldehyde proton of the adduct observed at 9.6 ppm exhibited NOEs in the 3-direction to A8 H1 and A8 H4 in the modified strand. All of these NOEs involved DNA protons facing the minor groove. Torsion Angle Measurements. The NOE between the X7 imidazole and the X7 H1 protons was of normal intensity, indicating that the X7 glycosyl torsion angle was in the anti conformation, consistent with B type DNA helix (41). Each of the phosphodiester resonances was observed in the standard 31P chemical shift range, suggesting that the backbone was not significantly perturbed by the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]dG adduct 3b. The pseudorotation (P) of each of the deoxyribose rings, estimated by monitoring the 3JHH couplings of sugar protons (34), was found to be within the C2-endo conformational range, also consistent with a B type DNA helix. rMD Calculations. At pH 9.3, the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methylpropyl]-dG adduct 3b represented the major species present in the sample, in equilibrium with diol 4b, and a trace of cyclic adduct 2b. At base pairs C6,G19, X7,C18, and A8,T17, this resulted in the observation of NOE cross-peaks arising from each of these three species. At the remaining base pairs more distal to the adduct, only one set of NOE cross-peaks was observed. To account for the lower intensities of NOE cross-peaks arising from adduct 3b at base pairs C6,G19, X7,C18, and A8,T17, as compared to the remainder of the molecule, these three base pairs were considered separately from the remainder of the oligodeoxynucleotide duplex. At base pairs C6,G19, X7,C18, and A8,T17, a total of 27 NOE cross-peaks specifically arising from adduct 3b were identified. The volume integrals of these crosspeaks were utilized for a series of calculations using the program MARDIGRAS, to yield distance restraints for base pairs C6, G19, X7,C18, and A8,T17. In separate calculations, volume integrals of NOE cross-peaks from base pairs G1,C24, C2,G23, T3,A22, A4,T21, and G5,C20 and from base pairs G9,C16, T10, A15, C11,G14, and C12,G13 were utilized for a series of calculations using the program MARDIGRAS, to yield distance restraints for the remainder of the oligodeoxynucleotide duplex. Utilizing this approach, a total of 308 distance restraints were obtained. Of these, 89 were internucleotide restraints and 219 were intranucleotide restraints. The five NOEs observed between the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b and the DNA served to orient the adduct within the minor groove. In addition to the NOE-derived distance restraints, a total of 90 sugar pucker restraints were obtained from the analysis of deoxyribose pseudorotation. These experimental restraints were augmented with 52 empirical hydrogen-bonding restraints that were included on the basis of spectroscopic evidence for the presence of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds (Figure 2). Likewise, additional empirical restraints were included on the basis of 31P NMR data suggesting minimal conformational perturbation of the phosphodiester backbone. These were used to restrain molecular dynamics calculations that utilized a simulated annealing protocol. The parametrization for the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b was as previously described (24). Sets of randomly seeded rMD calculations were initiated from two starting structures, in which adduct 3b was oriented in the minor groove. In the IniA starting structure, the adducted duplex was in the A-DNA conformation, whereas in the IniB starting structure, the adducted duplex was in the B-DNA conformation. The rmsd between the two starting structures was 6.3 Å. The choice of A-form and B-form starting

structures, as opposed to initiating the calculations from random coil DNA structures, was based upon the spectroscopic observations that the adducted duplex was relatively unperturbed as compared to its nonadducted counterpart. A stereoview of superimposed structures that emerged from the rMD calculations, beginning either with the A- or the

B-DNA starting structures, is shown in Figure 5. The structural statistics are listed in Table 1. Irrespective of starting structure, the rMD calculations yielded right-handed DNA helices with the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b oriented in the minor groove. These structures were more similar to B-form DNA than to A-form DNA, as indicated by rmsd analysis. Thus,

the average structure that emerged from the rMD calculations showed a 5.2 Å rmsd as compared to A-form DNA and a 1.7 Å rmsd as compared to B-form DNA. The accuracies of the structures that emerged from the rMD calculations with respect to 1H NOEs were assessed using complete relaxation matrix analysis with the program CORMA. This yielded sixth root residuals (R1x values) between the

theoretical NOE intensities predicted by the calculated structures and the experimental NOE data obtained at a mixing time of 150 ms. The total R1x value was 7.94 × 10-2. The agreement was somewhat better for intranucleotide NOEs, with an R1x value of 6.65 × 10-2, whereas for internucleotide NOEs an R1x value of 9.00 × 10-2 was obtained. Figure 6 shows R1x values for each of the nucleotides. At base pairs C6,G19, X7,C18, and

Discussion
Previously, the two N2-(3-oxopropyl)-dG aldehyde adducts 3a and 3b were modeled in 5-d(GCTAGCXAGTCC)-3,5d(GGACTCGCTAGC)-3 (24). The potential energy minimization predicted that both adducts 3a and 3b maintained WatsonCrick hydrogen bonding at both base pairs C6,Y19 and X7,C18. The modeling studies suggested that the for the S-stereoisomer of N2-(3-oxopropyl)-dG aldehyde 3b, the methyl group oriented within the minor groove in the 5-direction from the adducted nucleotide X7. This oriented the aldehyde group in the 3direction, placing it distal to the cross-linking target N2-dG in base pair C6,Y19. In contrast, the modeling studies suggested that for the R-stereoisomer 3a, the methyl group oriented within the minor groove in the 3-direction from the adducted nucleotide X7. This oriented the reactive aldehyde in the 5-direction, placing it proximate to the cross-linking target N2-dG in base pair C6,Y19. Significantly, the favored orientation of the corresponding acrolein-derived N2-(3-oxopropyl)-dG aldehyde also placed the aldehyde in the 5-direction, proximate to the cross-linking target N2-dG in base pair C6,Y19. The present study provides experimental evidence that corroborates the predictions of the modeling studies. Conformation of the S-Stereoisomer of N2-(3-Oxopropyl)dG aldehyde. Several lines of evidence supported the conclusion that the S-stereoisomer of N2-(3-oxopropyl)-dG aldehyde adduct 3b oriented in the minor groove with minimal perturbation of the B family DNA duplex. The 1H NOE data revealed a complete set of NOE connectivities at base pairs C6,G19, X7,

Conformation of the N2-[3-Oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG Adduct. The structures that emerged from the rMD calculations revealed the directionality of aldehyde and methyl protons for adduct 3b. In Figure 7, a CPK representation of the average structure is presented. The CPK model showed a relatively undistorted B family DNA helix with the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methylpropyl]-dG adduct 3b located in the minor groove. The crotonaldehyde-derived CH3 group was oriented in the 5direction with respect to the modified nucleotide X7. This placed the CH3 group proximate to the exocyclic amine of G19. In contrast, the aldehyde group of adduct 3b was oriented in the 3-direction with respect to the modified nucleotide X7. Figure 8 shows base-stacking interactions at base pairs C6,G19 and X7,

C18, and A8,T17 (Figure 1). In addition, the observation of imino 1H resonances at base pairs C6,G19, X7,C18, and A8,T17 (Figure 2), and NOEs between the imino protons of each base pair and the C6 NH2, C18 NH2, and A18 H2 protons of each base pair, respectively, indicated that the presence of adduct 3b did not disrupt Watson-Crick base pairing at the lesion site. Finally, analysis of chemical shift perturbations, deoxyribose pseudorotation, and 31P chemical shift perturbations all indicated little adduct-induced perturbation as compared to the unmodified duplex. Within the minor groove, the 3-orientation of the aldehyde proton of the crotonaldehdye-derived adduct at X7 was indicated by the observation of dipolar coupling with A8 H1 and A8 H4 in the modified strand. In contrast, the methyl protons of the adduct showed dipolar coupling with C18 H1, G19 H1, and G19 H4 in the complementary strand of the duplex, consistent with their 5-orientation in the minor groove with respect to X7 (Figure 4). The fact that no spectral line broadening was observed for the adduct protons as compared to the DNA protons, combined with the observed directionality of NOEs between the CH3 and the aldehyde protons with respect to minor groove DNA protons, suggests that the orientation of the N2(3-oxopropyl)-dG aldehyde adduct 3b within the minor groove is fixed at pH 9.3 and 30 °C. Structure-Activity Relationships. Adduct 3b exists in equilibrium with carbinolamine cross-link 5b. At equilibrium in this sequence, only small amounts of carbinolamine crosslink 5b arising from the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b were observed (22, 24). In contrast, R-R-CH3--OHPdG adduct 2a generated 26% of carbinolamine cross-link 5a. Moreover, for S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b, the rate at which interstrand cross-linking reached equilibrium was slow at pH 7 and 37 °C, requiring periods of several months at 37 °C. The 5-orientation of the crotonaldehyde-derived methyl group as confirmed by NMR spectroscopic analysis provides a plausible rationale for the differential efficiencies of interstrand crosslinking by the R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a and S-R-CH3-OH-PdG adduct 2b in the 5-CpG-3 sequence context. The present results suggest that stereochemistry at CR of the crotonaldehyde adduct plays an important role in hindering interchain DNA cross-link generation by controlling the positioning of the reactive aldehyde in N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methylpropyl]-dG adduct 3b with respect to the exocyclic amine of dG in the complementary strand. The low levels of carbinolamine cross-link 5b arising from the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b present at equilibrium also suggest that it must be thermodynamically disfavored as compared to carbinolamine cross-link 5a arising from N2-[3-oxo-1(R)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3a. This question is presently under investigation. Molecular modeling suggested that carbinolamine cross-link 5b was of lower stability than that of cross-link 5a, presumably due to the differential orientation of the CH3 group at the R-carbon of the cross-link (24). Lao and Hecht reported conducting molecular dynamics studies of pyrimidopurinone cross-links 7a and 7b, formed from adducts 2a and 2b, respectively, and reaching a similar conclusion, i.e., that the pyrimidopurinone cross-link arising from the R-R-CH3--13C-OH-PdG adduct 2a was of greater stability, due to a more favorable orientation of the R-carbon methyl group within the minor groove (10). Formation of Peptide-DNA Conjugates. Peptide trapping experiments demonstrated that both R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a and S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b formed DNA-peptide conjugates (23). The amount of peptide conjugate formed by S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2b was comparable to that formed

by the R-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 2a (23). Thus, it is concluded that while stereochemistry at CR modulates interstrand DNA cross-linking efficiency in the 5-CpG-3 sequence by positioning the aldehyde functionality distal to the exocyclic amine of dG in the complementary strand, it appears to play little role in modulating the formation of peptide-DNA conjugates. Genotoxicity of the N2-[3-Oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct. The cyclic 1,N2-propano-dG adduct 2b, which exists in equilibrium with the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b (Scheme 1), was detected in human and rodent tissues (11, 12). Fernandes et al. examined mutagenesis of adducts 2a and 2b in COS-7 cells using the single-stranded pMS2 shuttle vector (42). Their experiments indicated a 5-6% frequency of mutations, predominantly GfT transversions, corroborating experiments utilizing a randomly modified shuttle vector and replicated in human cells (43). The positions of the multiple equilibria involving adducts 2a and 2b (Scheme 1) are not known in vivo and consequently, the specific contribution of the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methyl-propyl]-dG adduct 3b to the overall genotoxicity and carcinogenicity associated with exposure to crotonaldehyde remains uncertain. The present observation that adduct 3b is not prone to form interstrand cross-links but adopts a conformation in the minor groove of DNA (Figure 7) that facilitates Watson-Crick base pairing (Figure 8) and suggests that it is less genotoxic than are other adducts formed by crotonaldehyde. It seems possible that adduct 3b allows for successful lesion bypass, as suggested for the acrolein-derived -OH-PdG adduct (44-48). On the other hand, incomplete conversion of crotonaldehyde-derived adduct 2b to aldehyde 3b or hydrated aldehyde 4b in duplex DNA (Scheme 1) may block DNA replication (49). The enzyme(s) responsible for trans-lesion bypass of adduct 3b in vivo remain to be identified. Washington et al. (50, 51) showed that the Y-polymerase pol  in conjunction with pol  or Rev 1 in combination with pol efficiently bypassed the acrolein-derived -OH-PdG adduct. Minko et al. showed that pol  bypassed the -OH-PdG adduct to a lesser extent (52). It seems plausible that these error-prone polymerases might also bypass the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methylpropyl]-dG adduct 3b. The DNA-protein conjugates formed by the S-R-CH3--OH-PdG adduct 3b (23) probably also contribute to the overall genotoxicity and carcinogenicity associated with exposure to crotonaldehyde. Structural Coordinates Available. The PDB ID code for the oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)methyl-propyl]-dG adduct is 2HLI.

Conclusion
Conformational analysis of the N2-[3-oxo-1(S)-methylpropyl]-dG adduct 3b revealed that it was located in the minor groove of DNA with the aldehyde moiety oriented in the 3direction while the methyl group was oriented in the 5-direction. The results suggest that the aldehyde moiety and the G19 amino group in the complementary strand are not positioned to facilitate interchain cross-link formation in the 5-CpG-3 sequence.
