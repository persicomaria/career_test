Abstract

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique type of head and neck cancer that is most prevalent in southern China. Previous studies have suggested that genetic susceptibility, environmental carcinogens, and EpsteineBarr virus (EBV) infection contribute to the etiology of NPC. Our group has identified the retinoic acid receptor responder (tazarotene induced) 1 gene (RARRES1; alias TIG1) to be transcriptionally silenced by promoter hypermethylation in ~90% of NPC cases, suggesting that its inactivation may be important in NPC formation. The aim of this study was to explore the functional role of the RARRES1 protein (alias TIG1) in NPC cells with EBV infection (HK1-EBV) and without (HK1). Cellular proliferation analysis, as measured by 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, showed that knockdown and overexpression of TIG1 in HK1 led, respectively, to significantly increased (P 5 0.005) and reduced (P 5 0.027) proportions of BrdU-labeled cells, compared with control cells. In contrast, knockdown or overexpression of TIG1 had no significant effect on cellular proliferation in HK1-EBV cells. Invasion chamber assay showed that TIG1 knockdown in HK1-EBV cells resulted in significant enhancement of invasive capacity of HK1-EBV cells (P 5 0.006). HK1 cells were not invasive, regardless of TIG1 status. These findings suggest that TIG1 may play a role in cellular proliferation and invasion in NPC cells and that its function may be dependent on the EBV status. Ó 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique type of head and neck cancer with distinctive ethnic and geographic distribution. Although the incidence rate for NPC is low among people of European origin in Western countries, Southern Chinese show high susceptibility to NPC [1]. In Hong Kong, although the annual incidence rate for men has decreased steadily from 21.3 to 15.4 per 100,000 during 1997e2006, NPC remains as one of the most prevalent cancers in men [2]. The etiology of NPC has been associated with multiple factors, including genetic factors, exposure to chemical carcinogens, and Epsteine Barr virus (EBV) infection [1,3]. Cumulative evidence indicates that additional genetic and epigenetic change in the NPC genome may also play an important role in the development and progression of NPC [1,3]. Our group has shown that numerous tumor suppressor genes and cancer-related genes, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A; alias p16), Ras association domain family

member 1 isoform A (RASSF1A), deleted in lung and esophageal cancer 1 (DLEC1), and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), are frequently inactivated in NPC through aberrant methylation at promoter region [4e7], suggesting that inactivation of these genes may contribute to NPC formation. Vitamin A (retinol) is essential for many physiological processes such as vision, maintenance of epithelial surfaces, immune competence, and reproduction and embryonic development in vertebrates [8]. The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid mediates multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, by modulating the rate of transcription of numerous target genes. More than 500 genes have been suggested to be regulated by retinoic acid, either through binding of ligand-bound retinoic acid receptor to the DNA response element of target genes or indirectly through actions of intermediate transcription factors and other regulatory proteins [9]. Aberrant retinoid signaling in human cancers was first demonstrated in acute promyelocytic leukemia, in which reciprocal chromosomal translocation leads to generation of oncogenic promyelocytic leukemiaeretinoic acid

receptor alpha fusion protein [10]. In NPC, only mild growth inhibition was observed with 13-cis retinoic acid treatment [11], although retinoid is used in chemotherapy and chemoprevention of head and neck cancer. Our group has previously reported that epigenetic silencing of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB), cellular retinol binding protein 1 and 7 (RBP1 and RBP7), and retinoic acid receptor responder (tazarotene induced) 1 (RARRES1; hereafter referred to by the alias, tazarotene induced gene 1, TIG1) is frequent in NPC, suggesting that inactivation of these genes may be important in NPC tumorigenesis and may contribute to the loss of retinoic acid responsiveness [6,12,13]. However, the significance of disrupted retinoid signaling in NPC formation is not clear. TIG1 was originally isolated from skin, and its expression was elevated upon treatment with the synthetic retinoid tazarotene [14]. In 2002, Jing et al. [15] reported that TIG1 expression, although detectable in normal and benign prostatic hyperplastic tissues, was absent in a great majority (92%) of malignant prostate tumors. The transcriptional silencing of TIG1 was demonstrated to be mediated mainly through promoter hypermethylation [16,17]. Subsequent studies showed that promoter hypermethylation of TIG1 was detectable in a wide variety of human cancers [18e26]. Clinicopathological correlation revealed that transcriptional silencing or promoter hypermethylation of TIG1 was associated with an increase in the malignant characteristics of cancers of prostate, esophagus, bile duct, and colon [15e17,21,22,27]. These findings suggest that TIG1 may be a potential tumor suppressor. Functional study of TIG1 is, however, limited [15,19]. Prostate tumor cells stably expressing TIG1 showed no apparent difference in growth rate compared with control cells, but exhibited reduced invasion ability and decreased in vivo tumorigenicity [15]. Moreover, it was shown that transfection of TIG1 into endometrial tumor cells resulted in suppression of colony forming ability [19]. Based on our previous finding of frequent hypermethylation of TIG1 in NPC [13], in the present study we investigated the functional role of TIG1 by examining the effect of TIG1 knockdown and overexpression on cellular proliferation and invasion. Cells were transfected either with a plasmid construct containing full-length TIG1 cDNA (for TIG1 overexpression) or with TIG1-targeting siRNAs (for TIG1 knockdown). In addition, we investigated whether EBV infection would modulate TIG1 function in NPC cells. To this end, we also evaluated NPC cells harboring EBV.

The histological diagnosis of specimens was confirmed by a pathologist. The human NPC cell lines HK1 and the matching EBV-infected cell line, HK1-EBV [28], were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. The HK1 cells showed partial hypermethylation at the promoter region of the TIG1 gene and low TIG1 transcript level [13]. HK1-EBV, generated from HK1 by coculturing of the latter with EBV-harboring Akata cells, exhibited a type II EBV latency expression pattern [28]. 2.2. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction Genomic DNA was extracted from three 5-mm thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of each NPC case and was subjected to sodium bisulfite modification as previously described [13]. The bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified using methylation-specific and nonmethylation-specific primers for TIG1 [18]. HeLa and D283 (a medulloblastoma cell line) were used as nonmethylation and methylation controls, respectively. All methylationspecific polymerase chain reactions were performed in duplicate. 2.3. Construction of TIG1 expression vector The full-length TIG1 cDNA clone was purchased from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The coding region of TIG1 was subcloned at the EcoRIeNotI sites of pcDNA4/ TO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; Hong Kong) and the resultant construct was named pcDNA4-TIG1. The authenticity of the TIG1 cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. 2.4. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction Total RNA extraction and reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed as previously described [29]. PCR primers for TIG1 were 50 -GAAAAAC CCCTTGGAAATAGTCAGC-30 and 50 -AGTGTGACACC TGTGTTGTCATTTCC-30 (annealing temperature at 59 C); and for GAPDH were 50 -AGCCGAGCCACATCGCTCA-30 and 50 -TGGCAACAATATCCACTTTACCAGAGTT-30 (annealing temperature at 60 C). 2.5. Transfection Cells were seeded at a density of 3Â105 cells/well onto 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. The next day, cells in each well were transfected with either 1.5 mg of pcDNA4-TIG1 (for TIG1 overexpression) or 100 pmol of siRNA pool (DharmaconeThermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO) targeting TIG1 (for TIG1 knockdown) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After incubation for 6 hours, the transfection mixture was replaced by fresh medium. The pcDNA4 vector and nontargeting siRNA

duplex (Dharmacon) were used as control and transfected into cells as described here. 2.6. 5-Bromo-2 -deoxyuridine incorporation assay Cell proliferation was evaluated by incorporation of 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) into cellular DNA (BrdU labeling and detection kit; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN; Hong Kong) [30]. Briefly, transfected cells were plated at low density and treated with BrdU labeling reagent for 1 hour. After ethanol fixation, cells were incubated with mouse anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody and then with fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody. The cell preparation on slide was mounted in Vectashield containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined with a Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope under Â200 magnification. Cells were counted from three random fields. The percentage of proliferating cells was calculated as the number of BrdU-labeled cells divided by the total number of cells counted. The experiment was repeated three times. 2.7. Three-dimensional collagen colony-formation assay At 24 hours after transfection, 200 mL of 3.6 mg/mL cold rat tail collagen, type I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was mixed with 200 mL of cell suspension (4.5Â104 cells/mL). The cell suspension-collagen mixture was plated as droplets onto a 60-mm Petri dish and allowed to set. After addition of fresh medium, cells were grown for 5 days. Cell morphology was examined under a phase-contrast microscope and colonies were counted from random fields under Â200 magnification. At least 500 colonies were counted from each sample and the percentage of colonies consisted of elongated or scattered morphology was calculated [30]. 2.8. Invasion chamber assay The ability of NPC cells to migrate through a matrigelcoated polyethylene terephthalate membrane with 8-mm pore size was evaluated using the BioCoat matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences). One day after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded in triplicates at a density of 4Â104 onto the 24-well chambers. After incubation for 40 hours, the noninvading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were carefully removed with a cotton swab. The invading cells adhering to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 2% crystal violet. The number of invasive cells was counted under light microscope at Â100 magnification. The experiment was repeated three times.

samples examined, 37 (90.2%) were positive for TIG1 hypermethylation (Fig. 1). The TIG1 methylation status was not correlated with age, sex, or clinical staging of NPC. 3.2. Cellular proliferation Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, transfection with siRNA targeting TIG1 and with pcDNA4-TIG1 in NPC cells resulted in O70% reduction and O300% increase of TIG1 transcript levels, respectively. Cellular proliferation was assessed by incorporation of BrdU into cellular DNA in growing cells. When TIG1 was knocked down in HK1 cells, the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells determined was 52.4% 6 2.6%, whereas the percentage of BrdUlabeled cells in control cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA was 40.0% 6 1.3% (6SD). A statistically significant difference was observed between the experimental and control cell populations (P 5 0.005) (Fig. 2). When TIG1 was overexpressed in HK1, a significantly decreased proportion of BrdU-labeled cells was observed, compared with cells transfected with vector only (35.5% 6 1.9% vs. 47.0% 6 2.0%; P 5 0.027). The consistent findings of enhanced and reduced proportion of BrdU-labeled cells under TIG1 knockdown and overexpression conditions, respectively, suggest that TIG1 may play a role in cellular proliferation in HK1. By contrast, HK1-EBV showed no significant change in the proportion of BrdU-labeled cells, compared with control cells, when TIG1 was either reduced (47.5% 6 2.1% vs. 43.0% 6 0.4%; P 5 0.21) or overexpressed (35.1% 6 3.7% vs. 34.5% 6 4.9%; P 5 0.89) (Fig. 2). 3.3. Three-dimensional collagen colony-formation assay We evaluated whether TIG1 would affect invasion capacity of NPC cells by examining the change of colony morphology in semisolid collagen-embedded media. Colonies with elongated and scattered morphology indicate higher invasive potential [30]. When TIG1 was knocked down and overexpressed, the proportions of colonies with elongated and scattered morphology in HK1 were 44.7% 6 9.7% versus 35.3% 6 6.3% and 33.4% 6 8.8% versus 45.1% 6 7.1%, respectively, and in HK1-EBV were

44.7% 6 9.7% versus 35.3% 6 6.3% and 33.4% 6 8.8% versus 45.1 6 7.1%, respectively (Fig. 3). However, the differences were not statistically significant. 3.4. Invasion capacity We investigated the invasive ability of NPC cells to migrate through matrigel-coated membrane. When TIG1 was knocked down in HK1-EBV cells, the number of cells that passed through the membrane increased threefold, compared with control cells (P 5 0.006) (Fig. 4). When TIG1 was overexpressed, however, we did not detect any significant change in invasion capacity of HK1-EBV cells. Unexpectedly, HK1 cells were unable to penetrate the matrigel-coated membrane and were noninvasive, irrespective of TIG1 status.

4. Discussion Previous studies have indicated that TIG1 is frequently inactivated by promoter hypermethylation in many human cancers, and that such epigenetic change is associated with

malignant characteristics of tumor cells [15,21]. Our group has also shown that promoter hypermethylation of TIG1 is common in NPC [13]. These results suggest that TIG1 may have a tumor suppressor role. In the present study, we examined the methylation status of TIG1 in NPC and investigated the functional role of TIG1 in NPC cells with and without EBV infection. Using an independent set of primary NPC samples, we determined the methylation status of TIG1 by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that promoter hypermethylation of TIG1 was detectable in 90.2% of NPC. These data were in line with our previous finding [13]. The high frequency of promoter hypermethylation of TIG1 detected in NPC suggests that epigenetic inactivation of TIG1 may be one of the key events in NPC development. We then explored the biological function of TIG1 in NPC. We transfected NPC cells with a construct containing a full-length TIG1 cDNA or with siRNAs specifically targeting TIG1 and determined the subsequent effect on cellular proliferation and invasion capacity. Our results showed that knockdown of TIG1 significantly enhanced cellular proliferation in NPC cells harboring no EBV

(HK1 cells), as indicated by an increased proportion of cells incorporated BrdU into cellular DNA, compared with control cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA. In keeping with this finding was the detection of reduced proliferation when TIG1 was overexpressed in HK1. These results are consistent with the findings of Takai et al. [19], who demonstrated that enforced expression of TIG1 in endometrial tumor cells led to suppression of clonogenic growth. Taken together, these data support the notion that TIG1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. In HK1-EBV cells, however, no significant change in cellular proliferation was observed, compared with control cells, when TIG1 was knocked down or overexpressed. One

explanation for the different proliferation responses to TIG1 in NPC cells is that EBV infection has activated signal cascades, such as the NFkB pathway, that promote proliferation [28,31], and so knockdown of TIG1 could not further enhance proliferative capacity of NPC cells carrying EBV. Because TIG1 was shown to affect invasion capacity of prostate tumor cells, we evaluated whether TIG1 might be involved in invasion in NPC. Knockdown and overexpression of TIG1 had no effect on colony morphology in collagen gel in both lines examined, compared with control cells. However, invasion chamber analysis revealed that knockdown of TIG1 in HK1-EBV resulted in a threefold

increase in the number of invasive cells, compared with cells transfected with siRNA negative control, indicating that inactivation of TIG1 promotes invasion capacity of HK1-EBV cells. Our analysis also revealed that HK1 cells become invasive after EBV infection. This result is in keeping with previous findings that immortalized epithelial cells transfected with EBV latent membrane protein 1 showed enhanced migration and invasion [32]. Both latent membrane protein 1 and latent membrane protein 2A have been shown to activate signaling pathways and to modulate multiple membrane proteins involved in migration and invasion, implicating a role in metastasis [33e36]. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that TIG1 may be involved in cellular proliferation and invasion in
