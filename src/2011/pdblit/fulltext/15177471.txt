Abstract--In this communication, we wish to describe the discovery of a novel series of 6-azauracil-based thyromimetics that possess up to 100-fold selectivities for binding and functional activation of the b1-isoform of the thyroid receptor family. Structure­ activity relationship studies on the 3,5- and 30 -positions provided compounds with enhanced TRb affinity and selectivity. Key binding interactions between the 6-azauracil moiety and the receptor have been determined through of X-ray crystallographic analysis. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been well established in humans that a hyperthyroid state leads to increased metabolic rate (thermogenesis).1 However, attempts to enhance metabolic rate in obese patients via treatment with thyroxine (T4), which is metabolized in various tissues to afford the active thyroid hormone T3, leads to unacceptable cardiac side effects. Human cardiac tissue has been shown to contain predominately TRa1, a major isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) family.2 T3 does not show preferential binding amongst the major TR isoforms (TRa1, TRb1, and TRb2), suggesting that identification of a TRb-specific agonist could lead to an agent which would retain the thermogenic potential, but would be devoid of the cardiac side effects. To date there have been a limited number of reports on efforts to identify thyroid ligands that interact selectively with the various TR isoforms. During the course

of our work, investigators at UCSF have reported that an oxyacetic acid analogue (GC-1) of DIMIT3 is a potent thyromimetic which exhibits $ 10-fold selectivity in binding to the TRb subtype.4 More recently, HY-1 a neutral analogue of GC-1 was discovered to be 5-fold more potent in activating TRb mutant (R320C) relative to the wild-type.5 In this communication, we wish to describe the discovery of appropriately functionalized 6-azauracils that are potent and TRb-selective thyromimetics.

that bind to TRb1 with submicromolar potencies and modest (5- to 15-fold) selectivities versus the a1-isoform of the thyroid receptor.6 These compounds were originally prepared as part of an anticoccidial program in the Veterinary Medicine Division.7,8 From a limited set of extant compounds, those derivatives containing a 40 methylthioether substituent (R1=SMe) possessed the greatest TRb1 potencies and selectivities. Not surprisingly, the most potent analogue (2) identified in this initial screen contains a lipophilic substituent (R2=methyl) in the 30 -position, which overlaps with the iodine and isopropyl substituents in T3 and DIMIT, respectively. Compound 2 possesses good binding affinity (Ki=2 nM, T3 Ki=0.08 nM) for TRb1 and has a 6-fold lower affinity for the a1-isoform of the thyroid receptor.

seen for the azauracil. Further simplification to the sixmembered cyclic urea (5) completely eliminates TR binding (Ki > 10,000 nM). This alignment of N-3 acidity (3> 4)5) and binding potency further supports the importance of the Arg320 interaction with an ionized imide functionality. Given the strict structural requirements of the 6-azauracil required for TR binding, further improvements in TRb binding potency or selectivity would have to be driven through modification of the diphenyl ether core. However, since the only difference between the ligand binding domains of hTRb and hTRa is a single residue (Ser277 in TRa for Asn331 in TRb) there was some question as to whether modifications to the diphenyl ether would have any impact on TR isoform binding selectivity. While there have been a number of SAR reports on modifications to the diphenyl ether core (ether linker, 3,5- and 30 -positions) of T3, few of these efforts have been directed towards enhancing TR isoform binding selectivity. Initial efforts around the 30 -position focused on profiling a range of substituents, including aminomethyl, acylamino, sulfonyl, alkyl, aryl, alkylamino, arylamino, acyl, carboxamido and sulfonamido (data not shown). From this initial evaluation of 30 -functional groups, carboxamido- and sulfonamido-based substituents exhibited the greatest potential for identifying potent, TRb-isoform selective thyromimetics. To aid in rapid structure­activity relationship development in the 30 -position, synthetic routes were designed which allow for the incorporation of the amide or sulfonamide functionalities as the final step. The core 6-azauracil-based diphenyl ethers (6) are constructed utilizing methodologies previously reported.7,8 The 30 position of the diphenyl ether core can be readily and selectively functionalized by formylation, chlorosulfonylation or nitration, employing 6 or the corresponding phenol (Scheme 1). Oxidation of the 30 -formyl derivative to the carboxylic acid and methyl ether cleavage affords 8. Activation of this o-hydroxyacid with N-hydroxysuccinimide provides a stable, activated ester

Neither 2 nor any of the other initial screening leads exhibit significant functional agonism of thyroid receptors. The lack of functional activity is due to the absence of the 40 -phenolic functionality present in classical thyromimetics which forms a hydrogen bond with a histidine residue in the TR binding pocket.9 Incorporation of the key 40 -hydroxyl and 30 -isopropyl functionalities (3) produces $ 100Â improvement in TRb1 binding affinity (Ki=0.03 nM) and functional agonism in E25B2 cells.10 Whereas DIMIT and T3 possesses no TR isoform selectivity, compound 3 retains a modest 8-fold TRb1 selectivity, confirming that the 6-azauracil functionality is responsible for the TR isoform selectivity observed. To gain insight into the structural features of the 6-azauracil moiety responsible for TR binding affinity, an X-ray crystal structure of 3 bound to TRb1 was generated (see Fig. 1).11 In analogy to the binding modes for T3 and GC-1,12 the ionized imide functionality of the 6-azauracil forms a hydrogen-bonding array with Arg320 of TRb1. In contrast to the structures of T3 and GC-1, an additional hydrogen bond interaction also occurs between the C-4 carbonyl of 3 and Arg316. A number of SAR findings relating to the 6-azauracil moiety are consistent with this binding motif defined by X-ray crystallography. Elimination of the acidic proton at N-3 of the azauracil ring (via N-methylation--data not shown) produces a> 50-fold reduction in receptor affinity. Removal of the nitrogen in the 6-position to afford the corresponding uracil 4 results in a 120-fold reduction in binding affinity for the TRb1 receptor. While 4 loses significant TRb1 potency it still retains a TRb1/TRa selectivity (9-fold) that is comparable to that

was held constant while the 3,5-substituents were varied (7a­c). As is observed for other 30 substituents, potency and selectivity increases in the following order: Me, Me < Me,Cl< Cl,Cl. In the case of the 7c binding affinity is restored to a level that is comparable to 3 and 4Â more potent than T3. In addition to enhanced potency, 7c also possesses an $ 4-fold enhanced TRb/TRa selectivity relative to 3. Attempts to introduce heteroatom functionality (7d­e) into the 30 site result in significantly reduced binding affinity. These results are consistent with the highly lipophilic nature of the 30 -receptor binding pocket.9 Sulfonamides derived from primary, aliphatic amines (e.g., 7f­g) exhibit reduced binding affinities (10­20Â) relative to tertiary sulfonamides of comparable size, though binding selectivity is not diminished. TRb binding is not diminished to such a great extent when a primary, aromatic amine (7h) is incorporated. Unlike in the case for aliphatic amine-based sulfonamide substituents, aromatic amine-derived, tertiary sulfonamides such 7i or the N-methylaniline analogue (data not shown) do not improve binding affinity. Based on the above results a range of tertiary sulfonamide substituents derived from aliphatic amines were profiled. In general, 30 substituents more sterically demanding than that present in 7c lead to a reduction in TRb1 affinity. One exception to this trend is 7j, which incorporates a tropinone-based functionality. Because of the hydrolytic instability of the ketal moiety in 7j the homologous spiro-tetrahydrofuranyl analogue 7k was prepared.13 Analogue 7k binds potently and selectivity (86-fold) to TRb1. In E25B2 cells 7k is a full agonist, however it is $ 30-fold less active than T3 (EC50=62 nM, T3=2 nM) and is 28-fold selective versus TRa (EC50 $ 1.5 mM, T3=2 nM). Structure­activity trends for the 30 -carboxamido series were quite distinct from that seen for the sulfonamides (Table 2). Though piperidinyl derivative 9b is more active than the 3-chloro-5-methyl analogue 9a, it is $ 30-fold less potent in binding to TRb1 than the corresponding sulfonamide (7c). Also in contrast to the 30 sulfonamides, amides derived from primary amines produced a substantial improvement in potency (9c vs 9b), though a decrease in the lipophilic character (9d) leads to a 10-fold reduction in potency. Another interesting point of divergence between the two series is that incorporation of a morpholinyl substituent did not significantly reduce potency (9e vs 9b) in the carboxamide case. Based on 9c, a range of commercially available monoand bicyclic-based secondary carboxamide substituents were evaluated. From this effort several bicyclic aminebased analogues (9f­9h) were discovered to possess potent TRb1 binding affinity and selectivities of up to 100-fold versus TRa. As a follow-up to these findings, the enantiomeric, nopinone-derived amines were incorporated to provide 9i and 9j.14 While both are potent (Ki $ 50 pM) binders, the R-enantiomer is substantially more selective. In functional assays 9i is both a potent

that can be employed in the preparation of a range of 30 amides (9). Synthesis of the corresponding 30 -sulfonamides (7) is accomplished through initial cleavage of the methyl ether of 6. Condensation of this phenol with chlorosulfonic acid provides the 30 -chlorosulfonyl intermediate, which can be coupled with amines to form the target sulfonamides 7. Table 1 details a cross-section of a wide range of sulfonamide substituents that were profiled in the 30 -position of the diphenyl ether core. Incorporation of the piperidinylsulfonamide group into the core structure (7a) produces a 15-fold loss in TRb binding affinity relative to isopropyl analogue 3. As part of the initial profiling in this series, the piperidinyl sulfonamide substituent

agonist (EC50=12 nM) and highly selective (77-fold) versus TRa. To date, a detailed receptor structure-based understanding of the impact on TR binding of these 30 modifications has been thwarted by an inability to cocrystallize ligands containing a 30 -substituent larger than isopropyl. It is presumed that modifications of the 30 -position produce conformational/positional shifts that negatively affect binding around the polar pocket (vicinity of Ser277) of TRa. A series of 30 -sulfonamide and 30 -carboxamide analogues of the screening lead 2 have been prepared. Several of these compounds have been shown to be potent and TRb-selective thyromimetics. The potential for these selective agents to increase metabolic rate, while limiting cardiovascular side effects, will be the subject of future reports. References and Notes
