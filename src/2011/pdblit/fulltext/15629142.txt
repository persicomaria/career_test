NAD kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Ppnk) uses ATP or inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)]. Ppnk overexpressed in Escherichia coli was purified and crystallized in the presence of NAD. Preliminary X-ray analysis of the resultant crystal indicate that the crystal belongs to hexagonal space group P6222 and is holo-Ppnk complexed with NAD.

In living organisms, NADP is formed through NAD phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by NAD kinase (EC 2.7.1.23) in the presence of a phosphoryl donor (1). NAD kinase is regarded as a key enzyme in NADP synthesis and, hence, in numerous cellular processes such as anabolic/biosynthetic pathways and protection against oxidative stress (1, 2). We clarified the primary structures and properties of NAD kinases from bacteria, Micrococcus flavus (Mfnk) (3, 4), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Ppnk) (4), Escherichia coli (YfjB) (5), and yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Utr1p) (6). Following our studies, other NAD kinases have reported for human (7), plant, Arabidopsis (NADK1 and NADK2) (8), yeast, S. cerevisiae (Pos5p and Yef1p) (2, 9, unpublished data), and bacteria, Bacillus subtilis (NadF) (10), and Sphingomonas sp. strain A1 (11). Of these, Mfnk, Ppnk, and NadF have been shown to be inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)]/ ATP-NAD kinases (3, 4, 10), while YfjB, Utr1p, Yef1p, NadK, NADK1, and NADK2 are ATP-specific NAD kinases (ATP-NAD kinases) (5, 6, 8, 11, unpublished data). Inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)]/ATP-NAD kinases use both poly(P) and ATP, while ATP-NAD kinases use ATP but not poly(P). Poly(P) is a polymer of inorganic orthophosphate residues linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, approximately equivalent to that of ATP (12). Poly(P) is assumed to function as an ATP substitute in cells and may be an ancient energy carrier preceding ATP (12). Cost-wise, poly(P) is cheaper than ATP (13). Although we succeeded in mass-producing NADP using poly(P) and poly(P)/ATP* Corresponding author. e-mail: kmurata@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp phone: +81-(0)774-38-3766 fax: +81-(0)774-38-3767 The last two authors contributed equally to this work.

NAD kinase (Ppnk) from M. tuberculosis (13), the lack of different poly(P)-utilizing kinases prevented us from applying poly(P) to the production of different biochemicals requiring ATP for production. Analyzing the crystal structure of Ppnk could clarify the poly(P) use of Ppnk and help determine biotechnological methods to confer on different ATP-specific kinases the ability to use poly(P). The structural analysis of Ppnk would thus be indispensable in applying poly(P) to producing a variety of biochemicals. We reported preliminary crystallographic data on Ppnk (14). Although the crystal structure of apo-Ppnk has been roughly determined (15), its coordinates have not yet been available. Substrate [NAD, ATP, and poly(P)]-binding sites and catalytic sites of Ppnk also have yet to be clarified, since no crystal structural information on holo-Ppnk complexed with a substrate has been determined. The two substrates of Ppnk and other NAD kinases, a phosphoryl donor (ATP) and acceptor (NAD), contain ADP, in which the 2¢ hydroxyl group of ribose in the ADP moiety of NAD is phosphorylated by NAD kinase, resulting in NADP. The clarification of substrate-binding sites of Ppnk is important to understanding how Ppnk discriminates between two ADP moieties in ATP and NAD, so we attempted to obtain the holocrystal of Ppnk complexed the substrate. Ppnk was purified from the cell extract of recombinant E. coli as described elsewhere (4), but using KNDE (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.2 mM NAD, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) as a basal buffer. Using EDTA inhibited proteolytic degradation of Ppnk and enabled us to obtain purified Ppnk. Ppnk was then concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centriprep (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) to yield a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (16). Ppnk

was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion on Linbro tissue-culture plates (ICN Biomedicals, Auora, OH, USA). The Ppnk crystal was prepared in a hanging drop (6 ml), mixed with 3 ml each of the reservoir solution (1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M HEPES­Na, pH 8.0, and 5 mM NAD) and Ppnk (10 mg/ml) in KNDE on a siliconized coverslip over 1.0 ml of the same reservoir solution. The condition differed from that in which the apo-Ppnk crystal was obtained (14). A prismatic colorless Ppnk crystal formed in about two weeks at 20°C, growing to a maximum 0.2 mm under the condition containing NAD (Fig. 1). To mitigate damage and measure higher resolution data, we collected data with a synchrotron at low temperature (100 K). Since the crystal froze in the absence of cryoprotectant, we soaked it in cryoprotectant solution (2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M HEPES­Na, pH 8.0, 5 mM NAD, and 25% glycerol) for 10 min. Diffraction data up to 2.70 Å was collected using synchrotron radiation at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å at the BL-38B1 station of SPring-8 in Hyogo, Japan. The obtained data were processed, merged, and scaled using program package HKL 2000 (DENZO and SCALEPACK) (17), and truncated with the Xtalview program (18). Preliminary crystal characterization indicated it belonged to hexagonal space group P6222 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 110.4, c = 108.9 Å. Among all reflections (93,585) observed, 11,192 independent reflections were obtained with

an Rmerge of 6.5%. Data exhibited completeness of 98.8% at up to 2.70 Å resolution. Data collection statistics for the crystal are summarized in Table 1. Ppnk is a tetramer of identical subunits with a molecular mass of about 35 kDa (4). One subunit of Ppnk per asymmetric unit yields a VM of 2.76 Å/Da and a solvent content of 56%. VM and solvent content lay within the range usually found for protein crystals (19). The crystallographic data we obtained on the Ppnk crystal was distinct from that on apo-Ppnk reported previously (14). The apo-Ppnk crystal belonged to monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell parameters of a=140.0, b=69.3, c=106.3 Å, and b = 130.1° (14). Since the crystal presented here was obtained under a condition containing NAD, we expected that the crystal was holo-Ppnk complexed with NAD. When we determined the structure of the expected holo-Ppnk by molecular replacement method using apo-Ppnk structure as a model, we found a electron density map, which corresponded well to the molecular structure of NAD (Fig. 2). Hence, the crystal presented here is considered to be holo-Ppnk crystal complexed with NAD. In primary structures of NAD kinases, two conserved regions (I and II) were found (5, 20) (Fig. 3). Our preliminary analysis of the holo-Ppnk crystal complexed with NAD indicated that both the two conserved regions and another region, which we specify as region III in Fig. 3, participated in

NAD binding. We are now in the process of determining the crystal structure of holo-Ppnk complexed with NAD and preparing the holo-Ppnk crystal complexed with ATP or poly(P). Crystallographic studies using holocrystals of Ppnk are expected to enable poly(P) to be applied to the production of a variety of biochemicals.
