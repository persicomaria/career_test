Abstract The mechanism of the heme-thiolate-dependent NADH-NO reductase (P450 NOR ) from Fusarium oxysporum was investigated by kinetic isotope effects including protio, [4S- 2 H]-, [4R- 2 H]-, [4,4 2 H 2 ]-NADH and stopped-flow measurements. The respective kinetic isotope effects were measured at high NO concentrations and were found to be 1.7, 2.3 and 3.8 indicating a rate-limitation at the reduction step and a moderate stereoselectivity in binding of the cofactor NADH. In a different approach the kinetic isotope effects were determined directly for the reaction of the Fe III ­NO complex with [4R- 2 H]- and [4S- 2 H]-NADH by stopped-flow spectroscopy. The resulting isotope effects were 2.760.4 for the R-form and 1.160.1 for the S-form. In addition the 444 nm intermediate could be chemically generated by addition of an ethanolic borohydride solution to the ferric­NO complex at 2108C. In pulse radiolysis experiments a similar absorbing species could be observed when hydroxylamine radicals were generated in the presence of Fe (III) P450 NOR . Based on these results we postulate hydride transfer from NADH to the ferric P450­NO complex resulting in a ferric hydroxylamine-radical or ferryl hydroxylamine-complex and this step, as indicated by the kinetic isotope effects, to be rate-limiting at high concentrations of NO. However, at low concentrations of NO the decay of the 444 nm species becomes the rate-limiting step as envisaged by stopped-flow and optical kinetic measurements in a system in which NO was continuously generated. The last step in the catalytic cycle may proceed by a direct addition of the NO radical to the Fe­hydroxylamine complex or by electron transfer from the NO radical to the ferric­thiyl moiety in analogy to the postulated mechanisms of prostacyclin and thromboxane biosynthesis by the corresponding P450 enzymes. The latter process of electron transfer could then constitute a common step in all heme-thiolate catalyzed reactions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Most members of the superfamily of P450 proteins act as monooxygenases in the metabolism of steroids and drugs in higher organisms as well as in the breakdown of organic compounds in bacteria. More recently, new P450 enzymes have been discovered which possess the same optical and EPR characteristics as the P450-dependent monooxygenases but are involved in very different reactions. Likewise thromboxane synthase and prostacyclin synthase catalyze the isomerization of prostaglandin-9,11endoperoxide [1,2], allene oxide synthases the isomerization of lipid hydroperoxides [3,4] and chloroperoxidase the chlorination of organic compounds in the presence of

hydrogen peroxide and chloride ions [5,6]. As a unifying hypothesis for the catalytic action of P450 enzymes one of us (VU) has proposed an essential redox-active role of the thiolate ligand by transfer of electron density to ferryl and perferryl intermediates [1,7­9]. Monooxygenase reactions as well as the rearrangements of peroxides to thromboxane A 2 , prostacyclin or allene oxides can be explained this way [1]. Recently one of us (HS) discovered a new heme-thiolate protein in the fungus Fusarium oxysporum which could catalyze the fast anaerobic reduction of NO to N 2 O by NADH [10]. At first sight this reaction bears no resemblance to known P450 mechanisms. Even no electron transport chain seemed to be involved, as had been reported for the energy conserving reduction of NO 2 / 2 NO 2 to N 2 O [11]. In the first publications on P450 NOR , a 3 one-electron pathway for the NO reduction was proposed [12], although biological NADH oxidation is not compat-

ible with single electron transfer. When additional spectral and kinetic measurements were undertaken a new spectral intermediate absorbing at 445 nm was found which was assigned to a two-electron reduced ferric NO complex in order to account for the reduced pyridine nucleotides [13]. The final product N 2 O was proposed to be formed by the following reaction: Fe III (NO)22 1 ? NO 1 2H 1  N 2 O 1 H 2 O 1 Fe III Although the kinetic profiles obtained for the individual steps support this mechanism, it remained chemically unsatisfying for several reasons: first, it did not contain a hydride transfer as classically observed with reduced pyridine nucleotides, second, the accumulation of negative charges around the ferric iron (S 2 , NO 22 , Por 22) is very unlikely, and most important in the context of this work the above mentioned iron­thiolate redox chemistry was not evident at any step of the proposed reaction cycle. Meanwhile the above proposed mechanism has been modified and an essential role of `proton delivery' for the formation of the intermediate has been reported [14,15]. Additionally, P450 NOR has a wide open heme pocket [16,17], which would allow a direct binding of NADH nearby the Fe­NO complex and a direct hydride transfer [18,19]. The finding of a new P450 protein with so far unrelated functions in the superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins presented a challenge for the postulated unifying mechanistic scheme and prompted us to study the role of NADH and the possible nature of the observable intermediates in greater detail. We here used 2 H-labeled NADH to investigate whether oxidation of the cofactor is involved in the rate-limiting step. The formation of the 444 nm intermediate was studied under low steady-state concentrations of NO by using the NO donor diethylamine NONOate. Our main intention was the characterization of the intermediate, which was achieved by cryo-spectrophotometry and pulse radiolysis and suggested an iron­hydroxylamine species.

tion of the deuterated nicotine adenine dinucleotides a Mono Q column (HR 15 / 10) from Pharmacia was used. NMR spectra were recorded with a Jeol GX 400 MHz FT NMR spectrometer, a Bruker AC 250 MHz FT NMR spectrometer or a Bruker WM 250 MHz FT NMR spectrometer. P450 NOR (CYP 55AI) was isolated from Fusarium oxysporum as described elsewhere [10]. It was quantitated by its absorption of the NO complex at 431 nm using an extinction coefficient of 100 mM 21 cm 21 [10]. A 86 mM solution of P450 NOR was usually diluted 1:4000 for spectral measurements. Diethylamine NONOate5DENO (Ethanamine, N-ethyl, compound with 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine (1:1)) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, USA). Ethanol-d 6 , d-glucose-1-d, glucose and alcohol dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma and Wako (Japan).

2.2. Synthesis of [4 - 2 H] -NAD 1
The 4-deuterated NAD 1 was synthesized according to a modified procedure of Podschun [20]. NAD 1 (200 mmol) was added to a solution of 2.1 mmol KCN in D 2 O (pD510.3). The pD of this solution was raised to 12.3 by the careful addition of NaO 2 H (4% in D 2 O). With increasing pD value the solution turned light brown and darkened progressively. After 3 h the dark brown mixture was added to 2 ml of 3 M K-phosphate buffer (pD56.0 in D 2 O) and the developing HCN was removed under reduced pressure at room temperature (RT). The pD was checked periodically and kept below 7 by addition of the deuterated K-phosphate buffer. For desalting the reaction mixture was applied to a Waters Sep-Pak-C 18 cartridge (10 g). After washing with 40 ml of 10 mM acetate buffer (pH55.0) the anticipated product was eluted with a mixture of 38 ml methanol and 2 ml 10 mM acetate buffer (pH54.8). For further purification methanol was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product applied to an equilibrated (1 mM acetate; pH54.8; 3 ml / min) Mono Q column. The product was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0 to 56 mM NaCl within 30 min). Yield: 38%. In the 1 H-NMR no signal between 8.8 and 9.0 ppm was detected. Otherwise the spectrum was in good agreement with published data on NAD 1 [21]. Therefore, an isotope purity of at least 95 atom% was concluded.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Materials
NO gas from Messer-Griesheim, Krefeld, Germany, (99.5% purity) was purified by washing with a KOH solution and solid KOH. NAD 1 , NADH and formate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.2.1.2, lyophilisate from yeast) were from Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany. Potassium cyanide, sodium formate and deuterium oxide (99.8%) were purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Potassium deuteroformate (99 atom%), NaO 2 H (99 atom%, 40% solution in 2 HO) were obtained from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (35 ml, 10 g) were from Waters, Milford, MA, USA. For the purifica-

2.3. Synthesis of [4,4 - 2 H] -NADH
[4- 2 H]-NAD 1 was reduced with dithionite in D 2 O by a modified procedure of Ohlmeyer [22]. [4- 2 H]-NAD 1 (50 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 ml acetone containing 0.6% phosphoric acid. To this solution 6.5 ml 1.3% Na-carbonate buffer in D 2 O and previously gassed with CO 2 / N 2 (1:4) were added, followed by 50 mg Na-dithionite. After 2 h incubation at room temperature inorganic salts were

precipitated by the addition of 25 ml cold ethanol followed by centrifugation after standing for 10 min at 2108C. The reduced double deuterated pyridine nucleotide was precipitated by the addition of 100 ml cold ethanol to the supernatant. The purity was confirmed with UV/ Vis spectroscopy (E 260 / E 340 52.45) and analytical HPLC. The 1 NMR (250 MHz, D 2 O) was in good agreement with published results on protio NADH with the exception of a lacking signal between 2.7 and 2.9 ppm. This implies a H / D exchange for both protons at the C-4-atom of the nicotinamide ring of higher than 95%.

NADH was purified in the same way as the R isomer. Yield: 85% E 260 / E 340 52.24­232). Alternatively [4S- 2 H]NADH was synthesized enzymatically by glucose dehydrogenase (Bacillus sp.) from NAD 1 and D-glucose-1-d (.97% isotope purity) [24,25]. The product was purified as described [26,27]. In the 1 H-NMR (250 MHz, D 2 O) no signal for the C-4 S-proton was detected whereas the doublet for the C-4 R-proton at 2.76 ppm exhibited a coupling constant of 1.8 Hz. A deuteration of at least 98% was concluded.

2.4. Synthesis of [4 R- 2 H] -NADH
A modified procedure from Ottolina et al. [23] was used starting from NAD 1 , deutero formate and formate dehydrogenase. In 6 ml degassed 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer (pH 8.2) 100 mmol NAD 1 (free acid, monohydrate), 7.7 mmol pyrazole and 800 mmol of K-deuteroformate were dissolved. To this solution 12.3 U formate dehydrogenase were added and the reaction was monitored by UV/ Vis spectroscopy. After 3 h a E 260 / E 340 quotient of 2.92 was recorded and the reaction mixture was applied to a Mono Q column equilibrated with 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , pH 8.2. After washing with the starting buffer for 10 min the [4R- 2 H]NADH was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (35­65 mM NaCl) within 30 min. Yield 77% (E 260 / E 340 5 2.27­2.30). In a different approach [4R- 2 H]-NADH was synthesized enzymatically by alcohol dehydrogenase (Yeast) from NAD 1 and ethanol-d 6 (.99% isotope purity) [24,25]. By the same way NADH was synthesized from NAD 1 and was used as an internal control for the measurements. After incubating the substrates for 15 min in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate at 308C. The enzymes were removed by passing the reaction mixture through a Centricon filter device and the NADD was purified by chromatography on a DEAE­Sepharose column (1.535 cm). The fraction with an absorbance ratio of 260 / 340 nm below 2.5 was collected and dried [26,27]. The 1 H-NMR (400 MHz, D 2 O) coincided with the published results [21] besides the fact that one doublet at 2.77 ppm with a coupling constant of 3 Hz was detected. No further intense signal in the characteristic region (2.7­3.0 ppm) was found and therefore an isotopic purity of more than 95% was derived.

2.6. Optical, EPR spectra and isotope effects for the overall reaction
A digitalized Aminco 2000 dual wavelength spectrometer was used to record optical spectra of P450 NOR . Quartz cuvettes (500 ml) with a teflon septum allowed anaerobic working and microliter additions. Unwanted oxidation products of NO were removed by passing the gas through solid KOH and through a saturated aqueous solution of KOH until no absorption at 340 nm was detectable. Subsequently this purified NO was supplied to a cuvette containing oxygen-free buffer (a solution of potassium phosphate at pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 0.1 M EDTA, 0.1 M DTT which was evaporated two times and each time flushed by argon) yielding a 1.7 mM NO stock solution (at 258C). Kinetics of NADH oxidation were followed at 340 nm versus 400 nm in the dual wavelength mode. Spectra of the quite stable ferric P450 NOR ­NO complex were also recorded on an Aminco instrument in solutions which contained 2.5 mM enzyme and either 0.5­1 mM DENO for continuous formation of NO or bolus additions of 500­1000 mM NO in 0.1 M K-phosphate buffer at pH 7 and 108C. The band of the intermediate at 444 nm was monitored after addition of 400­800 mM NADH to the above described solutions. Kinetic traces from these reactions were recorded either at 340 versus 500 nm to follow the loss of NADH or at 444 versus 500 nm to monitor the formation and decomposition of the intermediate band. EPR-spectra were recorded at X-band with a Bruker B-ER 420 spectrometer equipped with a NMR gaussmeter with a 100 Hz modulation at 158C. As samples we used 200 ml of 6 mM enzyme solution to which 100 ml of a saturated NO solution were added at room temperature and then frozen in liquid nitrogen.

2.5. Synthesis of [4 S- 2 H] -NADH 2.7. Stopped-flow measurements
The procedure was analogous to that for the 4R-isomer but using 3.52 mmol [4- 2 H]-NAD 1 in 1 ml H 2 O (pH5 4.8) as a starting material. To this solution 620 mmol protio-formate were added and the pH was adjusted to pH 7 with 100 ml 1 M NH 4 HCO 3 under continuous gassing with N 2 . Five U formate dehydrogenase were added and the reaction followed spectroscopically for 45 min until a quotient E 260 / E 340 of 2.58 was obtained. The [4S- 2 H]The stopped-flow instrumentation consisted of a JandM diode array detector and other parts were manufactured at the University of Konstanz [28]. P450 NOR (2.5 mM) was preincubated with 800 mM NADH in 0.1 M K-phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 and then mixed 1:1 with a 1 mM DENO solution in 0.01 M NaOH. Final concentrations were 1.25 mM enzyme, 400 mM NADH and 500 mM DENO in 0.05

M K-phosphate buffer at pH 7.1 and room temperature. During the first 100 ms 120 spectra were collected, then 100 up to 1000 ms and another 100 in the next 1­10 s. Data were collected and interpreted with the Spectacle software from Lab Control. The kinetics of the NADH or NADD driven formation of the 444 nm intermediate from the Fe III ­NO complex were determined in stopped-flow experiments as previously described [13,19].

tively. Radiation doses were used that produced between 10 and 200 mM radicals (17­340 Gy). All experiments were reproduced at least three times.

3. Results

3.1. Stoichiometry and affinities
The reported molecular activity for P450 NOR was high but the accompanying affinities were low for NADH as well as for NO [10]. This suggested that under physiological conditions the actual rates should be lower and even rate-limiting steps could shift. In order to measure NO consumption in a continuous assay we used the polarographic method in an anaerobic cuvette which also allowed a simultaneous recording of NADH oxidation at 340 nm. Starting out with maximal NO and NADH concentrations both substrates were consumed in a nonlinear fashion but the stoichiometry of 2:1 could still be determined accurately (Fig. 1). The KM -value (substrate concentration at the half maximal turnover rate) for NADH in presence of 800 mM NO was established at 1.25 mM and for NO also a rather high value of 600 mM was obtained in agreement with previous reports [13]. This was at obvious variance with the known rather high stability of ferric P450­NO complexes which we confirmed by plotting the reciprocal absorbance difference at 432 nm during the first 20 s against the reciprocal NO concentration in an anaerobic cuvette (Fig. 2) The resulting low KS -value (spectral dissociation constant5substrate concentration at the half maximal spectral change) of 20 mM was in agreement with the earlier reported high affinity of NO for P450 NOR and the

2.8. Spectroscopy of the hydride-formed 444 nm intermediate at low temperature
The ferric NO complex was formed from P450 NOR (2.5­5 mM) and DENO (25­100 mM) in 90 v / v% 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and 10 v / v% acetonitrile at 2108C. Acetonitrile was added to avoid freezing of the sample. Glycerol, glycol and ethanol were also tested, but had negative effects on the stability of the NO complex and / or the 444 nm intermediate. The sample compartment was flooded with dry argon to avoid water formation on the cuvette, which contained 500 ml of the sample. The reaction was started by addition of 1­5 ml ethanolic sodium borohydride to the stirred NO complex solution by a syringe through a septum. The reaction was followed spectrally between 432 and 458 nm allowing the recording of a spectrum within 13 s after mixing. Borohydride was used directly from a saturated stock solution in dry ethanol or was diluted in ethanol 2­10-fold before use.

2.9. Generation of hydroxylamine radicals by pulse radiolysis
The samples were irradiated with a Febetron 705 (Titan Systems Corp, San Leandro, CA, USA) 2 MeV accelerator. An Osram XBO 75 W/ 2 Xe-arc lamp was used as the light source for the time resolved spectroscopy in the 2 cm cell. The detection system consisted of an Acton SP300i monochromator with either a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier or a Princeton Instruments PI-MAX 512T gateable ICCD-camera. The photomultiplier signals used for the kinetic traces were amplified with a Femto HCA100 M-50 K-C 100 MHz current amplifier (Femto, Berlin, Germany) and acquired with a Yokogawa DL7100 oscilloscope. Spectra were acquired with the camera. Typically the shutter was open for 10 ms. Solutions containing the protein were protected from UV-light with a 3 mm Schott GG385 filter. All samples were saturated with N 2 O and contained 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 218C. Under these conditions radiolysis primarily yields hydroxyl radicals. The protein concentration was always around 3 mM and to preform the Fe­NO complex 25­100 mM of DENO were present. If 10 mM hydroxylamine or 10 mM formate were added, then the hydroxyl radicals react with these solutes to quantitatively yield hydroxylamine radicals 2 ( ? NHOH) or carbon dioxide radical anions ( ? CO 2 ) respec-

Fig. 1. Simultaneous recording of NADH oxidation and NO consumption. A Clark-type electrode was mounted on top of an aerobic cuvette containing 21.5 nM P450 NOR and 186 mM NO in buffer. The electrode potential was set at 2800 mV, covered with a high sensitivity foil (Yellow Springs Inc.) and the current recorded. NADH (55 mM) were added through a glass capillary tubing and the absorbance difference at 340 minus 400 nm was recorded simultaneously with the NO concentration as described under Materials and methods.

Fig. 2. Determination of the spectral dissociation constant of the P450 NOR ­NO complex (Lineweaver­Burk plot). A solution of 7.2 mM P450 NOR in buffer was placed in two anaerobic cuvettes and a baseline was recorded between 350 and 500 nm. Microliter additions of a saturated (1.7 mM) NO solution in water were made through a syringe and the spectral change at 436 nm was recorded after equivalent addition of buffer to the reference cuvette.

A: NADH oxidation was followed in the dual wavelength mode at 340 minus 400 nm for the complete reaction cycle of P450 NOR . The calculated values were from five independent experiments6S.D. B: The formation of the intermediate at 444 nm was measured by stopped-flow spectroscopy. The calculated values were from four independent experiments6S.D.

high second order rate constant of 2.6310 7 M 21 s 21 for the complex formation [12]. This clearly indicated that the overall affinity of 600 mM for NO consumption should be related to the second NO molecule entering the reaction cycle in a later step. For such a step two possibilities exist: either NO reacts with the primary Fe­NO species or with the 444 nm-intermediate formed after reduction by NADH. In the first case the reaction would require the formation of the [Fe 31 ­NO 2 Fe 21 ­NO] complex which would then be further reduced by NADH. This complex would absorb around 434 and 558 nm and would exhibit a characteristic EPR spectrum. Both were not seen (not shown) and hence the second NO molecule very likely reacts with the NADH-reduced intermediate with its absorbance at 444 nm.

3.2. Kinetic isotope effects
According to such results the most interesting and crucial reaction should exist in the transfer of two reducing equivalents from NADH to the primary ferric NO complex. Since the enzyme does not contain another redox center this transfer must be a hydride transfer to the N5O bond possibly followed, or occurring simultaneously, with proton addition to the oxygen. It is feasible to assume a rate-limitation at this step and therefore the double deuterated [4,4- 2 H 2 ]-NADH was prepared for determining a kinetic isotope effect for the overall reaction. In presence of 600 mM NO and the isotopically labelled cosubstrate the oxidation of NADH was followed at 340 nm and compared with the undeuterated compound. Due to a limitation in the available deuterated NADH the reaction was carried out with 100 mM NADH but the reactions could still easily be followed kinetically. An isotope effect of 3.860.2 S.D. was obtained (Table 1) Although the X-ray structure reveals an open active site

[16,17] P450 NOR contained no Rossman fold (bab) motif with the primary binding motif (GXGXXG) for NADH as typically observed in dehydrogenases [18,19]. In order to test whether a stereospecific binding of NADH exists we synthesized the [4S- 2 H] and [4R- 2 H] NADH counterpart and determined their kinetic isotope effects. For the Rform 2.360.2 S.D. and for the S-form a slightly but significantly lower value of 1.760.1 S.D. were derived (Table 1). As could be expected both values are lower than the isotope effect seen with the fully deuterated 4 position of the nicotinamide ring. The above described isotope effects reflect the overall catalytic cycle and point to rate-limitation at the step of reduced pyridine nucleotide oxidation provided that an excess of NO was present in order to enforce the decay of the 444 nm intermediate. A direct measurement of the kinetics for this step (Fe III ­NO1NADH / D444 nm intermediate) could be achieved by stopped-flow spectroscopy [13,19]. The formation of the intermediate was followed at 444 nm. The isotope effects for this reaction were determined to be 2.760.4 S.D. for the [4R- 2 H]NADH and 1.160.1 for the S-form (Table 1). From these results one can conclude that hydride transfer is involved in the rate-limiting step and is stereoselective for the Pro-R hydride of NADH.

3.3. Stopped-flow and spectroscopic measurements
If with an excess of NO the reduction of the ferric­NO complex is rate-limiting then the NO complex should form most of the enzyme in the steady state. This has been reported already by previous work [13], which thus confirms the isotope effects seen. Experiments at lower NO concentrations would reflect more the physiological situation since in F. oxysporum NO only occurs as an intermediate in nitrate reduction. However, due to the high

348

turnover NO is rapidly consumed which requires a continuous generation for steady-state measurements. Such conditions are provided by additions of diethyl NONOate (DENO). As shown in Fig. 3 the addition of DENO (0.5 mM) first converts the resting ferric enzyme (415 nm) into the NO complex (432 nm) and after adding 400 mM NADH a steady state with the 444 nm intermediate develops. This intermediate remains for about 10 min until NO or NADH are consumed (Fig. 3a, b). Evaluation of the stopped-flow spectra obtained in the first 400 ms after mixing show the immediate formation of the 444 nm absorbance (Fig. 4). The even faster primary formation of the ferric NO complex [13] is masked in the Soret region but can be seen in the visible spectrum by the typical a and b bands at 573 and 543 nm, respectively (Fig. 4a). The complete sequence involving the different species can be taken from Fig. 4b, which shows the corresponding time traces for the stopped-flow spectra.

3.4. Chemical generation of the 444 nm intermediate
Two different approaches were taken to identify the chemical nature of the intermediate. The first was based on a chemical hydride transfer by borohydride to the ferric NO complex of P450 NOR . To increase the lifetime of the intermediate these reactions had to be performed at low temperatures with the inherent problems of cryogenic measurements which have been described in the Materials and methods section. Another major problem was the fact that borohydride rapidly decomposes in aqueous solution with formation of hydrogen gas. This required us to work with ethanolic stock solutions and to add just the right amount of borohydride to the protein solution. Adding too much borohydride produced gas bubbles which blurred the spectra. In addition an excess of borohydride seemed to react with the intermediate resulting in Fe(II) or Fe(II)­ NO spectra. If not enough borohydride was added then the small portion of the intermediate immediately disappeared

The intermediate disappeared after all NADH (at 800 s) had been consumed.

The Fe(III) form (Soret band at 415 nm) was directly converted to the 444 nm species, without the intermediary formation of the Fe­NO complex (432 nm). The steady-state concentration of the 444 nm intermediate was reached after 300­400 ms and remained for minutes.

With a balanced addition of borohydride solution a spectral species emerged with the same absorption maximum at 444 nm (Fig. 5A) as the NADH-formed intermediate in Fig. 5B. The second approach was based on a known process of generation of hydroxylamine radicals by pulse radiolysis according to the following equations [29]: e ?2 1 H 2 O 1 N 2 O  ? OH 1 OH 2 1 N 2 k 5 9.1 3 10 9 M 21 s 21

OH 1 H 2 NOH  H 2 O 1 ? NHOH k 5 9.5 3 10 9 M 21 s 21

The formation of the hydroxylamine radicals was monitored at 230 nm and the initial absorption was consistent with the known absorption coefficient [30]. The half-life of

NHOH at initial concentrations of approximately 140 mM was 50­100 ms and after 1 ms at least 1% of the initial concentration remained (data not shown). It can be assumed that after the pulse only a small fraction of the radicals can reach the heme pocket and combine with the ferric P450 center. Therefore we produced radicals in 5- to 50-fold excess. In the reaction of the protein with ? OH alone (in absence of hydroxylamine) a loss of the band at around 420 nm and a build-up of a 432 nm species was noticed (not shown). This could reflect the formation of the ferryl complex (Compound II) as already observed in reactions with peroxynitrite [31]. Irradiating hydroxylamine alone (without protein) did not result in spectral changes between 400 and 480 nm (not shown). In the presence of H 2 NOH and ferric protein a decrease at around 420 nm could be observed, but also the build-up of a band around 444 nm (Fig. 6). This band reached a maximum within 4­5 ms after the pulse and decayed with a half-life of approximately 150 ms (Fig. 6,

conditions were tested in the presence and absence of DENO in order to allow single electron transfer to the [Fe­NO] 31 species and the ferric protein. Although variation of the pulse doses generated initial ? CO 2 con2 centrations from 20 to 200 mM, that is in 6- to 65-fold excess over the protein, no 444 nm intermediate could be observed but rather a broad absorbance at 460­470 nm appeared (not shown). Thus, we conclude that two oneelectron transfers to Fe(III)­NO did not occur, and could not have generated the 444 nm species. Due to the fast decay of the reactive species, which are formed after the pulse, and limitation of their reaction with the heme center of a protein by diffusion, the results of the pulse radiolysis experiments described above should be used only for qualitative but not quantitative interpretation.

4. Discussion and conclusions Our kinetic data provide independent support that the unusual reduction of NO to N 2 O by P450 NOR involves a 444 nm intermediate which is formed by reduction of the primary enzyme­substrate complex [Fe­NO] 31 by NADH in a rate-limiting step as long as the NO concentrations are high. Upon generation of NO by constant release from a NO donor the last step consisting in the reaction of a second NO molecule with the 444 nm intermediate becomes rate limiting. Concerning the chemical nature of the intermediate, the absence of any electron transfer components (e.g., flavins) already suggest direct hydride transfer from NADH to the NO complex which should be present predominantly as the Fe(II)­(NO)1 species and thus prone to H 2 acceptance. We now provide evidence that even borohydride can perform the reduction as a model for NADH. The pKa of the resulting species should favor hydroxylamine as the iron-bound intermediate. Formally this 444 nm absorbing species is present as a ferric hydroxylamine radical which could be supported by the pulse radiolysis experiments. Therefore all steps in the reaction cycle of P450 NOR have now been chemically and kinetically identified and can be summarized in Scheme 1. Even some more additional information can be taken from the present work. Hydride transfer from the prochiral NADH showed a significant difference between the 2 H-R and 2 H-S forms for both, the formation step of the intermediate and the overall reaction cycle and hence a stereochemical preference in the binding of NADH to the active site can be postulated. Most importantly, however, the postulated mechanism of N 2 O formation in the last step provides a clue to the role of the thiolate ligand in P450 NOR . The 444 nm intermediate can be considered isoelectronic with Compound II of P450 monooxygenases in which H-atom abstraction by Compound I results in an [S 2 -Fe IV-OHS-Fe III -OH] complex. This again corresponds to the first postulated intermediate [S-Fe III -OR] in

insert). At 1 ms after the pulse already 70­80% of the species had been formed. These data would be compatible with the chemical nature of the intermediate as [Fe­ NHOH] 31 being formed either by a reaction of the ferryl complex with hydroxylamine or of the ferric species with the hydroxylamine radical. In an additional approach the CO 2 -radical anion was 2 generated ( ? OH1HCOO 2 H 2 O1 ? CO 2 (k53.2310 9 21 21 M s ), E85 21.9 V) [32,33]. These strongly reducing

A potassium phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.2 which contained 25 mM of N 2 O, 10 mM of hydroxylamine and 3 mM of ferric P450 NOR was irradiated with a dose of approximately 250 Gy, which results in an initial concentration of¯140 mM ? NHOH. During different experiments either kinetic traces at 440 nm were recorded (see insert) or spectra between 410 and 470 nm were taken at 1 ms (black line), 2 ms (dark grey line) or 10 ms (bright grey line).

Scheme 1. Proposed reaction mechanism for the catalytic cycle of the NADH-dependent reduction of NO by P450 NOR . The mesomeric structures describe the borderline cases for the Fe­NO complex and the postulated 444 nm intermediate. The rate-limiting step is either the hydride transfer or the addition of the second NO molecule depending on the actual concentrations of NO and NADH.

the heme-thiolate-dependent isomerization of prostaglandin-9,11-endoperoxide to prostacyclin and thromboxane A 2 [7]. For these enzymes a subsequent electron transfer from the substrate radical to the iron­ thiolate moiety is the only feasible reaction [34] and this also applies for the last step in the P450 NOR cycle since a direct attack of the Fe­N bond by the stabilized NO radical is energetically not favorable. This would also suggest that in P450-catalyzed hydroxylation reactions, Compound II is not undergoing oxygen rebound [35] but electron transfer [34]. The activation energies of such electron transfer steps may be so low that the resulting final product formation in general appears as a concerted process. Thus the overall mechanism would start as a radical pathway but leads to ionic intermediates in a virtually concerted action and in P450's perferryl intermediates (Compound I) the sulfur-ligand has been reported to have a partial radical character [8,9] and also in the ferryl intermediates (Compound II) the sulfur-ligand should be non-innocent.
