Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are zinc endopeptidases involved in ti s u e remodelling. They have been implicated in a series of pathologies, including cancer, arthritis, joint destruction and Alzheimer's disease. Human neutrophil collagenase represents one of the three interstitial collagenases that cleave triple-helical collagen of type I, 11 and 111. Its catalytic domain (residues Phe79-Gly242) has been heterologously expressed in Eschrrichia coli and crystallized as a non-covalent complex with the hydroxamate inhibitor BB-1909, which has distinct selectivity against different MMP, in a crystal form. The crystal structure, refined to 0.1 8-nm resolution, shows that BB-1909 is a right-hand-side inhibitor that binds to the S,.-S,. subsites and coordinates to the catalytic Zn" in a bidentate manner via the hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms of the hydroxamate group in a similar manner to batimastat. The collagenase/ BB-1909 complex is described in detail and compared with the collagenasehatimastat complex. These studies provide information on MMP specificity and thus may assist the development of more-selective MMP inhibitors. Keywords: X-ray crystal structure; matrix metalloprotease ; protein . inhibitor complex ; drug design.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP, matrixins, vertebrate collagenases) are zinc-dependent and calcium-dependent endopeptidases responsible for degradation of extracellular-matrix components in normal tissue remodelling, for example, embryogenesis, processes involved in growth and development, menstruation events and wound healing (Birkedal-Hansen et al., 1993; Murphy and Docherty, 1992; Woessner, 1991). However, they have been also associated with pathologies involving connective tissue breakdown, including arthritis (Murphy and Hembry, 1992), osteogenesis imperfecta, degenerative joint diseases (Wernicke et al., 1996), Alzheimer's disease (Peress et al., 1995), and, in particular, tumour invasion and metastasis (Murphy et al., 1989, Murphy et al., 1991 ; Stetler-Stevenson et al., 1993). In these diseases, the degenerative potentials of MMP are no longer controlled by the presence of their specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (Stetler-Stevenson et al., 1989; Uria et al., 1994; Willenbrock and Murphy, 1994), and other regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, this enzyme family has been the focus of drug-discovery programs aimed at finding highly potent small-molecule inhibitors that may offer an alternative to

Efforts to determine which of the MMP, traditionally divided into collagenases, stromelysins and gelatinases, are employed by cancer cells to move aci-os the vascular basement membrane (metastasis) by breakdown of matrix barriers have sought to identify activated MMP in human clinical tissue from malignant tumours taken during primary surgery. Increased collagenase activity has been shown in gastric carcinomas (Kubochi, 1990), epidermoid carcinomas of the oral cavity and larynx, breast cancer (Freije et al., 1994), and in samples of lung carcinoma (Muller et al., 1991). An unprecedented aspect in this research effort is the key role played by structural biology in the design and discovery of inhibitors. For a long time, MMP-inhibitor design has been performed based on the knowledge of the detailed structure of the active site from crystallographic models of related metalloproteinases such as carboxypeptidase A and thermolysin. However, i n the last two years structural studies have generated models of the catalytic domains of human neutrophil collagenase (Bode et al., 1994; Reinemer et al., 1994; Grams et al., 199Sa,b; Stams et al., 1994), human fibroblast collagenase (Lovejoy et al., 1994; Spurlino et al., 1994; Borkakoti et al., 1994), matrilysin (Browner et al., 199.5) and stromelysin-I (Becker et al., 199.5; Dhanaraj et al., 1996; Gooley et al., 1994), unliganded or in complexes with peptidomimetic small-molecule inhibitors, indicating the importance of these studies for the design of drugs. These studies are being conducted, while medicinal-chemistry investigations pursue optimization programs targeted towards individual MMP. Recently, we undertook a structural analysis of the complexes of the collagenase catalytic domain with batimastat. HONHCOCH[(CH,)2CH-CH,ICO-~-Ala-Gly-NH,,Proand

Leu-Gly-NHOH, soluble hydroxamate inhibitors which mimic binding of primed (P,,-P3,) and non-primed residues of substrates, presenting the essential features that lead to inhibition of this enzyme (Grams et al., 1995a,b). With the present work we intend to continue these investigations to identify analogues of batimastat with greater specificity. We report the high-resolution 0.18-nm X-ray crystal structure of collagenase-(79 - 242) complexed with BB-1909, obtained in a crystal form and solved by molecular replacement, with distinct features in binding to the S,, to S,. region. The MMP under examination as potential therapeutic targets include mammalian collagenases, gelatinases and stromelysins. The relative importance of each of these enzymes is a matter of intense and largely unresolved debate. As the biology underlying these pathologies is gradually unravelled, the role of specific MMP in individual disease states becomes clearer. However, the debate will only be resolved by comparison of specific and broad-spectrum inhibitors in animal models and clinical trials. Medical chemists and structural biologists play a dual role in this unfolding story as spectators who wish to know the inhibitory profile of an ideal therapeutic inhibitor and as participants who generate specific inhibitors that are essential to dissect the role of MMP in individual pathologies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of the N-terminal catalytic domain of human neutrophil collagenase. A truncated form of human neutrophil
procollagenase lacking the C-terminal haemopexin-like domain was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded by dialyzing the inclusion bodies, solubilized in 6 M urea/ 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, against 100 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCI,, 0.5 mM ZnCl,, and 20 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.5, as described previously (Schnierer et al., 1993). The latent proenzyme was activated by limited proteolysis with mature stromelysin-1 upon incubation at 37°C for 16 h. The activated enzyme [comprising residues Phe79-Gly242 of the catalytic domain; collagenase-(79 - 242)] was purified to homogeneity by hydroxamate-affinity chromatography, and its N-terminal sequence was confirmed by chemical sequencing. Synthesis of inhibitor BB-1909. BB-1909 (Fig. 1) was synthesized as described (Dickens J. P., Crimmin, M. J. & Beckett, R. P., WO Patent 94/02447, 1994). Crystallization. Inhibited collagenase-(79-242) was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 22 "C from drops mixed from 1.5 pl protein solution (11.7 mg/ml in 3 mM Mes/NaOH, 100 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCl,, 0.5 mM ZnCl,, and 0.02% NaN,, pH 6.0), 1 pl SO mM inhibitor, and 5 pl 10% (mass/vol.) poly(ethylene glycol) 6000, 0.2 M Mes/NaOH, pH 6.0. These drops were equilibrated against 1 M Na,HPOJ NaHZPO,, pH 6.0. Crystals belonging to space group P2,2,2, (as determined in the course of molecular replacement) were obtained after 4 days. They share this space group with previously reported collagenase . inhibitor complexes (Grams et al., 1995a,b; Bode et al., 1994) but exhibit different cell constants and contain two collagenase-(79-242) . BB-1909 complexes/ asymmetric unit. The associated Matthews parameter (Matthews, 1968) is 0.0027 nm3/Da. Data collection and structure analysis. X-ray-diffractionintensity data were collected from a single crystal on a MAR Research (Hamburg) imaging plate detector attached to a Rigaku Denki RU200 rotating Cu-anode generator operated at 5.4 kW at 17°C. Data up to 0.181-nm resolution were evaluated with MOSFLM v. 5.23 (Leslie, 1991), and loaded, scaled, merged and truncated with programs of the CCP4 suite (CCP4, 1994). Table 1 provides a summary of the data processing.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement by means of the stand-alone version of AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using the protein and metal-ion coordinates published for a collagenase-(79 -242) . Pro-Leu-Gly-NHOH inhibitor complex, refined to 0.25-nm resolution (Reinemer et al., 1994). The rotation function computed with data between 1.5-nm and 0.35-nm resolution revealed two peaks of 22.1 % and 18.4% correlation coefficients (Navaza, 1994) and by a third (spurious) peak with a correlation coefficient of 11.9%. The calculation of translation functions for the two former peaks enhanced the contrast towards the background (correlation coefficients of 34.8 o/c and 28.7%, respectively, compared with 12.3% for the third peak). A subsequent rigid-body refinement of both solutions performed with FITING from the AMoRe suite (Navaza, 1994) led to a correlation coefficient of 69.7 % and a crystallographic R,;,,,,,,of 31.7%. The correctly oriented and translated solutions were subjected to rigid-body and reciprocal-space least-squares refinement (without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints) with energy constraints as implemented in X-PLOR version 3.1 (Brunger, 1991) using target parameters derived from the Cambridge Database (Engh and Huber, 1991). The inhibitor was built and refined stereochemically by means of INSIGHT 1 version 1 2.2.0 (Biosym Technologies) and subdivided into two residues (Fig. 1) connected by a peptide bond. Appropriate topology and parameter files were set up for X-PLOR. The outstanding quality of the initial (omit) (2F,,,, - F,,,,) and (Fc,h\ F,,),,) maps allowed the fitting of the complete inhibitor model into the initial electron density. The model was compared with calculated (2F,,,, - F,,,,) and (F,,, - FLt,,J electron-density maps, rebuilt (including solvent molecules placed at stereochemically reasonable positions) using the interactive graphics program TURBO Frodo v. 5.3 (Biographics) and refined to convergence in several cycles. In the last steps of refinement, individual temperature factors were refined by applying bonded and angular temperature restraints. The final model comprises 2588 non-hydrogen protein atoms (corresponding to the two collagenase-(79-242) molecules present in the asymmetric unit, labelled 79A -242A and 79B-242B), four Ca'+ and four Zn'+ (996A-999A and 996B -999B, respectively), 303 solvent molecules and 56 (nonhydrogen) inhibitor atoms [two inhibitors of 28 atoms, each in a complex with a collagenase-(79-242) molecule], grouped in two residues (IlA-12A and IlB-12B; Fig. 1). Because both complex monomers are virtually identical, the suffixes A or B are generally omitted when referring to protein and inhibitor residues. This model displays a crystallographic R,,,,,,,of 19.1o/o as refined against 34 348 reflections between 0.6-nm and 0.18-nm resolution (Table 1). The rmsd from target values for bond lengths and angles are 0.0012 nm and 1.655", respectively. An inspection of a Ramachandran plot performed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) reveals no residues in disallowed regions. Two residue pairs from both crystallographically independent molecules (Arg145A and Arg145B, and Asn157A and Asn157B) are located in the zones defined as generously allowed. The peptide bond between Asn188(A,B) and Tyrl89(A,B) is in the cis conformation. The surface-located loop 132-135 is in discontinuous density in complexes A and B. All pictures have been made with TURBO-Frodo (Biographics) and MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991). The coordinates will be deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession number 1 kbc).

reported previously for liganded and non-liganded enzyme forms (Bode et al., 1994; Reinemer et al., 1994), the crystals obtained differed significantly from those obtained previously by the cell constants (a = 3.32 nm, b = 6.95 nm, c = 7.25 nm, versus a = 4.47 nm, b = 8.08 nm, and c = 10.81 nm in our crystals) but shared the same spacegroup P2,2,2,. Consideration of the packing lead us to assume that a dimer of collagenase(79-242) . BB-1909 complexes was present in the asymmetric unit of this crystal form; this was confirmed by the molecularreplacement search performed with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). Both complexes present in the asymmetric unit did not deviate significantly in their spatial structure (despite refinement without applying non-crystallographic-symmetry restraints) as demonstrated by an rmsd of 0.027 nm for all 164 Ca atoms. Both bound inhibitors were similar, except for the conformation of five methylene groups, C2-CC (Fig. 1) in the 13-membered ring that are not directly in contact with the enzyme moiety. Therefore, the features of the collagenase-(79-242) . BB-1909 complex will be discussed for complex A.

Main features of the collagenase-(79-242) structure. Collagenase-(79-242) exhibits a spherical shape notched by a shallow active-site cleft separating a larger upper N-terminal domain from a smaller lower C-terminal domain (Fig. 2 displays collagenase-(79-242) in the standard orientation, that is with the active-site cleft running from left to right; this orientation will be used hereafter to define the terms up, down, left, right, front and back). The main upper domain consists of a central highly twisted five-stranded P-pleated sheet, flanked by an S-shaped double loop and two bridging loops on its convex side, and by two long a helices including the active-site helix on the concave side. The edge strand 4 of the p sheet running from Leu160 to Phe164 is positioned above the active site helix and forms the upper rim of the active-site cleft; together with the preceding bulged segment Gly155-Leu160 it is part of the S-shaped double loop (Fig. 2), and represents an important substrate and inhibitor binding region. The catalytic ZnZ+ is situated at the ~ bottom of the active-site cleft coordinated to the N E imidazole atoms of the three histidine residues of the extended zinc-binding consensus sequence His1 97-Glut 98-Xaa-Xaa-His201 -XaaXaa-Gly204-Xaa-Xaa-His207, which surround the second half of the active-site helix and the main chain downstream of His207. The conformation of this segment is topologically equivalent to the corresponding parts of other members of the MMP family, and to other metzincin metalloendopeptidases (Stocker et al., 1995), namely the astacins, the adamalysins, the serralysins, leishmanolysin and the zinc endoprotease from Streptomyces caespitosus (Kurisu et al., 1997). In the native unliganded structures reported for the catalytic domains of MMP, a solvent molecule attached to the side chain of Glu198 (part of the previously mentioned consensus sequence), which is presumed to play the role of the general base in the proposed cleavage mechanism for metalloproteinases (Grams et al., 1996; Mat-

The standard orientation is with a bound substrate running through the active-site cleft from left to right. This moderately deep cleft, which accommodates the catalytic Zn2+(central magenta sphere), separates an upper from a lower domain. The histidine side chains that coordinate the catalytic Zn" and the side chain of the general base (3111198 are shown as dark blue sticks, and the bound BB-1909 as a green stick model.

thews, 198S), coordinates the catalytic Zn2+.In addition, collagenase-(79-242) harbours a second Zn2+ and two Ca'+ with structural functions packed against the top of the sheet ( Fig. 2). The smaller lower domain consists of two wide loops and a C-terminal three-turn a helix. The first of these wide righthanded loops includes a tight 1,4-turn from Ala213-Tyr216. This 'Met-turn' represents a conserved topological element in the metzincins (Bode et al., 1993; Stocker et al., 1995) with the side chain of Met215 providing a hydrophobic base for the three histidine residues that coordinate the catalytic Zn2+.

The specificity of collagenases resides mainly in the S,. pocket, explaining the preference of these enzymes to cleave Nterminal to medium-sized hydrophobic side chains, such as leucine residues. This pocket lies immediately to the right of the catalytic Zn2+ (according to the orientation of Fig. 2 ) and is formed by a long surface crevice (running perpendicular to the active-site cleft) separated from the bulk solvent by the initial part of strand Pro217-Tyr219, which forms the outer wall. The entrance to this pocket is formed by the bulge segment Gly158Ilel59-Leu160 and the initial part of the edge strand Leul60Ala161 forming the upper side of the pocket, by the Tyr219 side

chain (on the right hand side of the pocket), by the wall-forming segment including the Asn218 side chain (lower side), and by the catalytic Zn' ` and the Glu198 carboxylate group (left side). These features provide a series of polar groups for anchoring bound peptide substrates and inhibitors by hydrogen bonding. The polar entrance opens into a much more hydrophobic interior. The bottom of the pocket is partially filled by two solvent molecules and capped by the long side chain of Arg222, flanked by the side chains of Leu193 and Leu214. The terminal arginine guanidyl group is weakly hydrogen bonded to Pro21 1 0, Gly212 0 (via a solvent molecule) and Ah213 0. Several intersected polar groups provide anchoring points for the enclosed solvent molecules, one of which is i n direct hydrogen-bond contact with a localized bulk-solvent molecule through an opening between the Arg222 side chain and the wall-forming segment. Just before entering the active-site helix at Asnl90, the main chain forms a wide surface-located loop from Tbr183 to Tyrl89. Before this latter residue, the densities in the crystallographically independent complexes A and B indicate the presence of cis peptide bonds. This unusual conformation permits a favorable hydrogen-bond interaction of Tyr 1 89 N with the main chain carbony1 oxygen of Thrl81 (3.2 A away in complexes A and B), with the preceding carbonyl group of Am188 pointing out towards the bulk solvent.

The binding of BB-1909 to collagenase-(79-242). Fig. 1 shows the chemical formula of the BB-1909 inhibitor and the IC,,, values measured against neutrophil collagenase, fibroblast collagenase, stromelysin-1, 72-kDa gelatinase, and matrilysin. Fig. 3 shows a section of the complex structure around the bound inhibitor superimposed with the final electron density. The peptide backbone of this primed-side inhibitor is bound in an overall extended manner and lies antiparallel to the bulge-edge strand Gly158-Ala161 and parallel to the Pro217-Tyr219 segment on the other side of the active-site cleft (Fig. 4 ; Table 2). The catalytic Zn" is liganded in a bidentate manner by the hydroxyl oxygen and the carbonyl oxygen of the hydroxamate group, together with the three liganding histidine nitrogen atoms of the enzyme. The hydroxamate hydroxyl is further coordinated to the side chain of the catalytic base, Glu198 Oc2, and the hydroxamate nitrogen is anchored to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala161 of the upper rim and Glu198 Ocl.

The tetrahedral carbon C1 (Fig. 1) exhibits an S configuration with its hydroxyl group directed away from the protein surface; the hydroxyl group does not interact with the protein moiety and is hydrogen bonded to a solvent molecule (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This hydroxyl group contributes to the high solubility of BB-1909, despite the long aliphatic segment of its 13-membered lactam ring. The isobutyl group (Figs 1 and 4) extends into the S,. pocket in a similar manner to the side chain of the PI. leucine of a bound peptide substrate. The following peptide bond (emulating a bond between a PI. and a P,. residue of a substrate) is anchored by two hydrogen bonds to the bulge-forming segment and the outer wall of the pocket (Fig. 4). The macrocycle occupying the S , or S,, location of the enzyme moiety forms intermolecular contacts via two main-chain hydrogen bonds made up by the amide nitrogen (to Gly158 0 of the bulge-forming segment; Fig. 4 and Table 2) and the carbonyl group oxygen (with Tyr219 N of the outer lower wall of the pocket; Fig. 4). The rest of the ring does not establish any direct interactions with the protein moiety; this is shown by the variability observed in the inhibitor molecules A and B for five of the methylene groups (C2-CC; Fig. 1) of the ring (Fig. 4).

of MMP catalytic domain . inhibitor complexes published show a substrate-like binding of the inhibitor along the active-site cleft and a zinc-binding group, which is usually a hydroxamic acid group. Most of the inhibitors are right-hand-side inhibitors with large hydrophobic P,, residues occupying the deep S,, pocket of the protein, as is BB-1909. There are no prominent S, or S3, pockets. In all inhibitors, the P , residue sits in the active-site cleft formed on the upper side by residues Gly158 and Ile159 and on the lower side by residues Pro217 and Asn218. The P,. residue is exposed mainly to solvent. Fig. 5 displays the superposition of BB-1909 with batimastat after optimal least-squares fit of both collagenase-(79-242) . inhibitor complexes (Grams et al., 1995a). As was anticipated from the molecular structure of both molecules (Fig. I), the binding of BB-1909 and batimastat is almost equivalent for the structural parts. The hydroxamate group binds to the catalytic Zn'+ in a similar mode, and the conformation of the common main chain atoms is topologically superimposable. The main differences arise from the two side chains present (:CH,-S-C,H,S and -CH,-C,H, in batimastat and -OH and -(CH2),oin BB-1909).

The first batimastat side chain resides in the S, pocket, whereas the second points in the opposite direction of the decamethylene P, side chain (which is cyclized to the P,. amide nitrogen). BB-1909 is generally less active than batimastat, the broadspectrum inhibitor described in our previous work (Grams et al., 1995a), as can be deduced from the IC,, values against different MMP (Fig. 1). Moreover, it has a significantly different selectivity profile to batimastat. While BB-1909 is 25-fold less active against stromelysin-I than against neutrophil collagenase and 10-fold less active against matrilysin than against fibroblast collagenase, the corresponding ratios for batimastat are 4 and 1.2, respectively. To understand their selectivity differences we have docked the refined BB-1909 coordinates into the active-site coordinates of fibroblast collagenase, stromelysin-1, matrilysin and a homology model of the 72-kDa gelatinase catalytic domain. Examination of the active-site residues above and below the ring carbons bridging the P , and P,. side chains on the inhibitor reveal that stromelysin- 1 and matrilysin have asparagine residues in the position occupied by glycine in the other structures (Gly158 in neutrophil collagenase). The asparagine amide nitro-

gen atom pr!bably would form a disfavourable close interaction (about 3.6 A) with the C[ methylene carbon on the inhibitor macrocycle (Fig. 6B). Visual inspection of the active-site suggests that the asparagine side chain gives rise to at least some of the reduced activity against stromelysin-1 and matrilysin observed with BB-1909. However, the picture is complicated by the finding that another asparagine residue on the proline turn in neutrophil collagenase, Am21 8 (leucine in stromelysin-1, threonine in matrilysin and serine i; fibroblast collagenase), forms close interactions (3.5 and 3.6 A) with the carbon atoms of the inhibitor macrocycle without any loss in activity (Fig. 6A). The asparagine-macrocycle interaction does not give rise to any loss in activity, and BB-1909 displays equal activity against fibroblast and neutrophil collagenases. We believe that this example is typical of the way in which structural studies can be used to provide structure/activity data and to stimulate ideas leading to the discovery of inhibitors with increased potency and selectivity.
