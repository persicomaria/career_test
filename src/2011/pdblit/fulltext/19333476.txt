Received (in Cambridge, UK) 18th December 2008, Accepted 30th January 2009 First published as an Advance Article on the web 26th February 2009 DOI: 10.1039/b822781k Crystal structures of A-form and B-form DNA duplexes containing 2 0 -S-methyl-uridines reveal that the modified residues adopt a RNA-like C3 0 -endo pucker, illustrating that the replacement of electronegative oxygen at the 2 0 -carbon of RNA by sulfur does not appear to fundamentally alter the conformational preference of the sugar in the oligonucleotide context and sterics trump stereoelectronics. The conformation of nucleosides is subject to various stereoelectronic and steric effects.1 In the case of the 2 0 -deoxyribose moiety the Southern and Northern regions in the pseudorotational cycle represent preferred ring puckers.2,3 Thus, conformations corresponding to the C20 -endo and C30 -endo phase angle (P) ranges adjacent to the South and North poles, respectively, give rise to the canonical B- and A-DNA duplex forms at the oligodeoxynucleotide level.4 By comparison, the presence of a hydroxyl group at the ribose 2 0 -position shifts the conformational equilibrium to the Northern half at the mononucleoside level and locks the RNA duplex in the A-form. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Ferguson and co-workers proposed that the sugar moieties in an oligo-20 deoxy-2 0 -S-methyl-ribonucleotide (20 -SMe-RNA) paired to RNA preferentially adopt the C20 -endo conformation.5 This is in contrast to the 2 0 -deoxy-20 -O-methyl RNA analog (20 -OMe-RNA) paired to RNA, in that its sugars are limited to the C3 0 -endo range by the electronegative substituent.5 The latter observation is supported by structural data.6,7 Moreover, the conformational preorganization of the 2 0 -OMe-RNA strand for the RNA target is consistent with the increased thermodynamic stability of 2 0 -OMe-RNA≠RNA duplexes compared to the corresponding 2 0 -SMe-RNA≠RNA duplexes (ref. 5 and cited references). Although sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, the switch from the North to the South conformation of the ribose in the oligonucleotide context as a result of replacing oxygen with sulfur at the 2 0 -position is surprising. The conformational preorganization of the sugar furnished by electronegative and/or bulky 20 -substituents has been widely

used in oligonucleotides against RNA targets in antisense and RNAi applications.8≠10 For example, the 2 0 -deoxy-20 -fluororibo- (2 0 -F-RNA11) and 2 0 -deoxy-20 -[(2-methoxy)ethyl]-ribonucleic acid modifications (20 -MOE-RNA12) exhibit a strong preference for the C3 0 -endo sugar conformation and their duplexes with RNA are restricted to the A-form. Conversely, acid modification the 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 -fluoroarabinonucleic (20 -FANA) shows a preference for the C2 0 -endo pucker at the level of the mono-nucleoside.13 But in duplexes, the 2 0 -FANA sugar has been observed to preferably adopt the O4 0 -endo (East; in B-form DNA or 2 0 -FANA≠RNA hybrids)14≠16 or even the C3 0 -endo or C4 0 -exo conformations (Northern; in A-form DNA).17 Individual nucleosides can adopt a range of conformations within duplexes without significantly affecting the overall geometry of the latter (i.e. O40 -endo in B-DNA).14 But neighboring residues whose P values differ more drastically (i.e. 41201) can cause deformations of the duplex that include kinking and groove widening/narrowing.17,18 Therefore, it is evident that the conformational preferences of nucleosides affect the geometry and stability of oligonucleotide duplexes and, in turn, that the duplex geometry can have an effect on the conformation of individual nucleosides. However, in reality it is often not straightforward to predict the conformational properties of nucleosides, or to model the geometric features of duplexes containing a mix of residues that have deviating sugar puckers. In addition to the intrinsic sequence-dependent, conformational preferences of oligonucleotides, interactions with cations,19,20 water21,22 and proteins4,23,24 impinge on their geometry. In order to analyze the conformational properties of 20 -SMe-RNA and to establish the conformational boundaries of 20 -thiomethyl-ribonucleosides, we determined crystal structures of two DNA duplexes with incorporated 20 -SMe-rU residues. We chose two DNA oligomers to study the conformational properties of 20 -SMe-RNA, the decamer d(GCGTATACGC) and the dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) (the Dickerson≠Drew dodecamer or DDD). The 10mer normally adopts an A-form conformation when at least one nucleoside is replaced by a 20 modified residue25 and the DDD constitutes a classic example of a B-form DNA.22,26 Here, we report crystal structures for duplexes of sequence GCGTAU*ACGC and CGCGAAU*U*CGCG ∞ containing 20 -SMe-rU (U*) residues at 1.04 and 1.25 A resolution, respectively (see ESIw).z Examples of the quality of the final electron density are shown in Fig. 1 and final refinement parameters are listed in Table S1 (see ESIw). The 10mer duplex adopts a regular A-form conformation with all residues including U*6 and U*16 (nucleosides are

numbered 1≠10 in strand 1 and 11≠20 in strand 2) exhibiting a C3 0 -endo pucker (Fig. S1, ESIw). Although it is possible that the 2 0 -SMe-ribofuranose is driven towards North as a result of its surroundings, this observation provides an indication that sulfur in place of oxygen (either in the form of 2 0 -OH or 2 0 -OMe) does not appear to fundamentally affect the conformational preferences of the sugar. The situation of U* embedded in a more or less canonical A-DNA duplex likely does not emulate the constraints put on a chimeric 20 -SMe-RNA/DNA or all-20 -SMe-RNA strands opposite RNA. However, it is noteworthy that 20 -arabino-T nucleosides displayed a C10 -exo (South≠Eastern) pucker inside the same A-form duplex,17 indicating that the overall geometry of the 10mer does not necessarily limit the sugar conformation to North. Unlike the A-form duplex that shows a regular overall geometry, the [CGCGAAU*U*CGCG]2 duplex with U* residues ¿¿ replacing dT at positions 7 and 8 of the first and positions 18 and 19 of the second strand (nucleosides are numbered 1≠12 in strand 1 and 13≠24 in strand 2) undergoes a significant expansion in the central minor groove compared to the native 12mer (Fig. 2). At the ApU* step (underlined in the above sequence), the roll amounts to ¿201 (¿11; values at ApT in the native DDD are ∞ ∞ in parentheses), the rise is 4.0 A (3.34 A), the twist is 41.51 (331) ∞ (¿0.30 A). These distortions are a direct ∞ and the slide is 0.44 A consequence of the C3 0 -endo sugar pucker of all four U* residues. In addition to the Northern sugar conformation of these residues, the deoxyriboses of 3 0 -adjacent C9 in strand 1 and C21 in strand 2 also adopt the C30 -endo pucker. Both cytidines display a C2 0 -endo pucker in the structure of the native DDD,22 indicating that the change is brought about by their vicinity to the U* residues. All adenosines display a C2 0 -endo pucker and the transition from A (South) to U* (North) is accompanied by a subtle change in the backbone conformations of U*7 and U*19. The b and g torsion angles of both residues flip from the standard ap/+sc to the ¿ac/ap ranges. Compared to the structural changes observed in the central tetramer, the outer G-tract tetramers show helical geometries that are similar to those found in the native DDD (Fig. S2, ESIw). Thus, the strong roll observed at the ApU* step does not lead to a kink of the duplex as indicated by the relatively straight global helix axis (Fig. 2(B)). Moreover, there are no significant geometrical deviations between the two independent duplexes per crystallographic asymmetric unit. As a result of the wider minor groove there are no short contacts between 2 0 -SMe-substituents from opposite strands in the modified

A close-up view into the central minor groove reveals intra- and inter-strand van der Waals interactions between 2 0 -SMe moieties and an interrupted minor groove hydration spine (Fig. 3). Assuming that 20 -SMe-purines and -pyrimidines display similar conformational preferences, the finding that 20 -SMe-uridines adopt a C30 -endo (North) pucker inside both A- and B-form duplexes argues strongly against the earlier conclusion based on MD and ab initio calculations5 that the sugars of an oligo-20 SMe-RNA strand paired to RNA, unlike oligo-2 0 -OMe-RNA,

prefer a C2 0 -endo (South) conformation. The 20 -substituents of U* residues in our crystal structures are pointing into the minor groove (Fig. 3(A)). Based on the conformational preferences predicted earlier, one would expect the substituents to lodge inside the major groove. The latter orientation would not interfere with RNase H, an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA portion of RNA≠DNA hybrids,27 binding the latter from the minor groove side. However, it was recently reported that 2 0 -SMe-RNA≠RNA hybrids do not elicit RNase H,27 consistent with our above structural observations [changes in the minor groove width of hybrid duplexes are also known to affect RNase H activity (ref. 33 and cited references)]. That the DDD duplex undergoes a drastic conformational change as a result of the substitution of T residues by U* is also demonstrated by assays with a restriction enzyme (Fig. 3(B)). EcoRI cleaves between G and A (underlined) in the recognition sequence 5 0 -GAATTC-30 /3 0 -CTTAAG-5 0 (contained in the DDD, ¿¿ ¿¿ Fig. 2(B)). Accordingly, the DDD with either one T or both Ts replaced by U* (labeled as TU* and U*U*, respectively) is not cleaved by EcoRI, an effect that must be largely due to conformational changes as a result of the 20 -SMe substituents and not the absence of the 5-methyl group in U compared with T.37 Support by the National Institutes of Health is gratefully acknowledged (Grant R01 GM55237).

Notes and references
z Structure solution and refinement: the structure of the 10mer was determined by the molecular replacement (MR) technique using an A-form DNA (PDB ID 411D) as the search model.28,29 All attempts to phase the 12mer data by the same approach failed, as did crystallization experiments for subsequent heavy atom phasing with 12mers containing either Br5C in place of C or, either one of the two, or both U* residues replaced by 2 0 -SeMe-U.30≠32 The structure was ultimately determined by co-crystallizing the U*-modified DDD with Bacillus halodurans RNase H33 and then phasing the structure of the complex by MR, using the coordinates of the enzyme alone as the search model. The coordinates of the 12mer obtained from the complex structure then served as the model to determine the crystal structure of the duplex alone by MR. Initial crystallographic and B-factor refinements of the 10- and 12mer structures were carried out with the program CNS,34 setting aside 10% (5% for the 10mer) randomly chosen reflections for calculating the R-free. After the addition of water molecules and metal ions as well as incorporation of the U* residues and adaptation of the dictionary files, refinements were continued with the program SHELX,35 using anisotropic temperature factors for all nucleic acid and solvent atoms. Final refinement parameters for the two duplex structures as well as the RNase H complex are listed in Table S1 (ESIw). All helical parameters were calculated with the program CURVES.36 EcoRI cleavage assay: 500 nM DNA labeled with 32P were mixed with 2 mL of 10X NEB EcoRI buffer (New England Biolabs), 2 mL of EcoRI (20K units mL¿1; New England Biolabs) and diluted to a reaction volume of 20 mL to obtain a final buffer concentration of 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.025% Triton X-100. The samples were incubated at 37 1C for 90 min, followed by PAGE. Data deposition: final coordinates and structure factor files have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (http://www. rcsb.org). The entry codes are 3EY1 (RNase H≠dodecamer complex), 3EY2 (decamer) and 3EY3 (dodecamer).
