Nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase is a ubiquitous enzyme that has been described to have regulatory functions. In addition to its classical enzymatic activity, NDP kinases have been characterized as inhibitors of metastasis, as a factor stimulating gene transcription, and as a protein kinase. In this report we show some characteristics of the autophosphorylation of homogeneous NDP kinase and make a comparison with that of other proteins in crude extracts. By using labeled substrates and fluorescence quenching analysis, we prove that Mg2 is indeed necessary for the two steps of the ping-pong reaction to take place and present evidence that NTPs or NDPs, when uncomplexed to divalent cations, may not bind the active site in a comparable way to NTP Mg2 and NDP Mg2 . However, even extremely small concentrations of Mg2 suffice for maximal autophosphorylation which is obtained with Mg2 in the nanomolar range and 100 M ATP using homogeneous enzyme. Moreover, lower autophosphorylation levels were observed with increasing concentrations of Mg2 . The autophosphorylation equilibrium varied from 0.19 to 1.6 upon the inclusion of 10 mM EDTA to produce low Mg2 concentrations. Under optimal conditions (low

Mg2 concentrations and short incubation times) NDP kinase was the only protein phosphorylated in crude extracts from Candida albicans, indicating that the autophosphorylation properties of the enzyme are very singular. © 1998 Academic Press Key Words: Candida albicans; Dictyostelium discoideum; NDP kinase; nm23; awd; histidine autophosphorylation; Mg; nucleotide binding fold.

human and murine genes (nm23) described as inhibitors of metastasis were found to be NDP kinases (1­ 4). More recently it was found that human NDP kinase B acts as a transcription factor, activating the transcription of the oncogene c-myc in vitro and in vivo (5, 6). Also, NDP kinases have been described to have protein kinase activities (7, 8). These important findings led to numerous investigations in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in order to understand the different processes in which NDP kinase is involved. Nevertheless, little is known about its regulation. Very recently we reported that phosphorylation of human NDP kinases A and B by protein kinase CK2 greatly diminishes their enzymatic activities inhibiting the first step of the reaction, i.e., autophosphorylation (9). A number of NDP kinases have been cloned and the crystal structure of NDP kinase from humans, Dictyostelium, Drosophila, and Myxococcus xanthus has been obtained, revealing that the structure is highly conserved during evolution (10 ­13). The crystal structures of NDP kinase­NDP Mg2 complexes reveal that the Mg2 ion does not have a specific protein binding site but rather that it interacts with the protein through its location on the nucleotide complex (12, 14), a characteristic which is not common to other kinases and nucleotide binding proteins. In addition, and up to date, the NDP kinase nucleotide binding fold appears to be unique (15). Previous work from our laboratory indicated that NDP kinases from Candida albicans and human sources were found to be autophosphorylated in vivo on the catalytic histidine (E-P, see Eqs. [1] and [2]) (9, 16). Similarly, Timmons et al. reported that most of the species with different pI found in Drosophila extracts were phosphoenzyme intermediates of the reaction (17). However, no physiological role has yet been ascribed to the presence of in vivo autophosphorylated species of NDP kinase. We have previously concluded that NDP kinase in vitro autophosphorylation takes place only on histidine residues and that the previously characterized serine autophosphorylation could be accounted for by nonenzymatic transphosphorylations from the phosphohistidine high-energy intermediate (16). The role of Mg2 in the NDP kinase autophosphorylation process required clarification since there are reports suggesting that autophosphorylation can occur in the absence of Mg2 (14, 18). In this report we study the effect of different concentrations of Mg2 on NDP kinase autophosphorylation and show that NTP Mg2 and NDP Mg2 are indeed needed for both steps of the ping-pong reaction. Nevertheless, we also show that under very low Mg2 concentrations the enzyme can efficiently autophosphorylate in the presence of ATP and provide an explanation for this phenomenon. The

role of Mg2 to allow nucleotide binding to the NDP kinase active site is discussed.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Materials. C. albicans crude extracts and the homogeneous NDP kinase were obtained as described (19). Polyclonal antibodies raised against D. discoideum NDP kinase were a generous gift of Dr. M. Veron (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and used as described previously (19). Recombinant D. discoideum NDP kinase was obtained as previously described (20). Dissociation constants were obtained from (21) and corrected for pH, ionic strength, and temperature using the Max Chelator program (22). This program was also used to calculate bound and free concentrations of the different species. [ -32P]ATP was obtained from New England Nuclear. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. X-ray films (Curix-RP1) were from Agfa Gevaert. All other reagents were of analytical grade. 2.2. Autophosphorylation of NDP kinase observed by SDS­PAGE. Autophosphorylation of homogeneous C. albicans NDP kinase (1 M) was performed in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, at 4°C for 5 min in the presence of 50 M [ -32P]ATP (5 Ci), 1 mM EDTA, and varying conditions as described in the legend to Fig. 1, unless otherwise stated. Crude extracts for autophosphorylation experiments were used immediately after preparation or after keeping them at 20°C in 20% glycerol, with identical results. For these autophosphorylation assays, the reaction mixtures contained 20 g of extract, 10 mM EDTA in 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.5. In ADP depletion studies, reactions were performed in 40 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, and 50 M MgCl2 (low Mg2 ); when appropriate, 10 mM MgCl2 or 10 mM MgCl2 along with pyruvate kinase (1 g), a condition that depletes ADP, were added to the incubation mixture. The incubations were made in a final volume of 10 l, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 vol of Laemmli sample buffer 2 (23) saturated in urea, heated for 1 min at 45°C, and run in 15% SDS­PAGE; the gels were dried and exposed to X-ray films. Under these conditions, all autophosphorylation was proved to be on the catalytic histidine, without detectable phosphorylation on serine residues (16). 2.3. Fluorescence emission spectra of NDP kinase to reveal autophosphorylation. The assay was performed as previously described (20) at 20°C using NDP kinase (5 M) in Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.5 ( exc 295 nm; excitation bandwidth 2 nm; emission bandwidth 4 nm), in a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer. To quantify the equilibrium of autophosphorylation in the presence of 10 mM EDTA and 0.25 mM Mg2 , assays were performed under different [ADP]/[ATP] ratios in a constant total amount as described (20); under these conditions, maximal autophosphorylation was reached after 200 ­300 s. The data in the presence of excess of Mg2 were taken from (20).

3. RESULTS

Mg2 effect on autophosphorylation of homogeneous C. albicans NDP kinase. Purified C. albicans NDP kinase was autophosphorylated under different conditions, and the products were separated by SDS­PAGE (Fig. 1). Increasing Mg2 concentrations markedly reduced the level of autophosphorylation under the established conditions (approximately 50%, Fig. 1A). This effect of Mg2 could result from the inhibition of the autophosphorylation itself, to an increase in ATPase activity, or to a change in the equilibrium of the

FIG. 1. Effect of Mg2 on the autophosphorylation of homogeneous NDP kinase. Autophosphorylation of pure C. albicans NDP kinase was performed in the presence of 50 M [ -32P]ATP (5 Ci) in the presence of 1 mM EDTA or with the addition of EDTA as stated. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS­PAGE; the gels were dried and exposed to X-ray films. (A) With the addition of the stated concentrations of Mg2 ; (B) as in A but in the indicated lane, 10 mM Mg2 was added after an initial 5 min incubation in its absence and incubated an additional minute before stopping the reaction; (C) With EDTA added as stated (uncontrolled free concentration of the cation). Using D. discoideum enzyme, similar results were obtained.

reaction. We further verified that this effect was not due to inhibition of autophosphorylation. Thus, addition of Mg2 drastically diminished the level of the phosphointermediate when added after an autophosphorylation experiment was performed in its absence (Fig. 1B). Moreover, these concentrations of Mg2 did not inhibit the activity of the enzyme when assaying the complete reaction with radioactive substrates (not shown). The possibility that Mg2 could act by stimulating an intrinsic ATPase activity of the enzyme, as was described for M. xanthus NDP kinase (18), was discarded since no difference in the liberation of Pi was found when different Mg2 and EDTA concentrations were used in the assays (not shown). Figure 1 also shows that divalent cations are needed during the autophosphorylation reaction (Fig. 1C), which is in agreement with early studies indicating that the true substrates of NDP kinase are NTP Mg2 and NDP Mg2 (24). Nevertheless, without the addition of Mg2 , high levels of phosphorylation could be observed (Fig. 1A), probably because very low amounts of the free cation present in the solution could be reused for multiple autophosphorylation events, leading, in the time interval assayed, to maximal phosphorylation levels even in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. These results presented a paradox: while a divalent cation was needed for the autophosphorylation to take place, addition of high concentrations of Mg2 produced a lower level of autophosphorylation. To explain the effects of Mg2 on autophosphorylation, we propose that when NDP kinase is incubated with ATP in the micromolar range, with nanomolar

concentrations of free Mg2 and in the absence of acceptor NDP, the divalent cation is mostly bound to ATP and not to the ADP formed upon phosphorylation. This is due to the much higher concentration of ATP as well as to its higher affinity for the cation--KDATP Mg2 6.99 10 5 M 1 and KDADP Mg2 6.96 10 4 M 1 at pH 7.5 (see Materials and Methods). Thus, the very low amounts of the complex ADP Mg2 that could be formed as a product of the autophosphorylation reaction (Eq. [1]) cannot exceed that of the enzyme concentration and would not allow the completion of the whole reaction/reverse reaction (Eq. [2]). The absence of ADP Mg2 would then be the main reason for the stabilization of the autophosphorylated intermediate of the NDP kinase reaction. As an example, when 1 M NDP kinase is incubated in the presence of 100 M ATP, 0.5 mM Mg2 , and 10 mM EDTA, after autophosphorylation takes place the concentration of ATP Mg2 would be 64 nM and that of ADP Mg2 would be 67 pM. It would be expected that this particular equilibrium established at very low concentration of one of the substrates (ADP Mg2 ) would be altered by increasing the Mg2 concentration. The concentration of intermediate should then be diminished as a consequence of the higher concentrations of the ADP Mg2 complex. To verify that the Mg2 effect was due to the appearance of the ADP Mg2 complex and not to a direct effect on NDP kinase, removal of ADP was performed by adding excess of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase in the presence of 10 mM Mg2 . As expected, the removal of ADP restored the levels of autophosphorylated intermediate to the levels obtained at low Mg2 concentrations (not shown). To further characterize the effect of Mg2 on the autophosphorylation levels we performed different autophosphorylation experiments under high (10 mM) or low (50 nM) free Mg2 concentrations. We tested variable relative concentrations of ATP and NDPs (ADP or GDP) that would either allow the whole reaction to take place optimally (ATP:NDP ratio 5­10:1) or result in partial inhibition by ATP (ATP:NDP ratio 10:1) or by NDP (ATP:NDP ratio 5:1). These ratios are valid for the pairs ATP:ADP and ATP:GDP because of their very similar kinetic constants for C. albicans NDP kinase (19). All conditions tested supported the hypothesis that Mg2 was indeed diminishing the concentration of autophosphorylated enzyme by allowing the whole reaction to take place. Conditions that favored the occurrence of the whole reaction exhibited lower levels of phosphoenzyme. Thus, when different concentrations of GDP were added to the reaction, the autophosphorylated enzyme concentration was diminished in the presence of 5 mM Mg2 more than one order of magnitude more efficiently than under low free Mg2

FIG. 2. Autophosphorylation under increasing concentrations of GDP. Autophosphorylation was performed as detailed in the legend to Fig. 1 under high (A) or low (B) concentration of Mg2 and 100 M ATP. (A) 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Mg2 ; (B) 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM Mg2 . GDP was included in the assays at the concentrations stated; it is expected that most of the GDP is complexed with Mg2 at high concentrations of the cation, whereas under low Mg2 free GDP would compete with ATP for the cation. Under optimal Mg2 concentration for NDP kinase activity, the ratio 100:10 (ATP:GDP) gives the maximal activity, while greater concentrations of GDP would inhibit the reaction producing dead-end complexes.

those experiments the complete autophosphorylation was obtained upon the addition of 10 mM EDTA to ``stop'' the reaction and not under the conditions reported. Using the fluorescent quenching methodology as a measure of autophosphorylated NDP kinase we verified the variation in the equilibrium of autophosphorylation in the presence of EDTA and compared it with values obtained previously (20) (Fig. 4). As presumed from the results presented in Fig. 2, the equilibrium measured at half reaction varied more than one order of magnitude, from 0.19 0.02 (using 5 mM Mg2 ) to 1.6 0.30 in the presence of 0.25 mM Mg2 and 10 mM EDTA. In addition, no fluorescence quenching was observed in the presence of EDTA and ATP, when incubated without the addition of Mg2 . Mg2 in the context of D. discoideum NDP kinase structure. Structures of the enzyme­NDP Mg2 crystallized complexes were obtained using NDP kinases from different origins and various natural NDPs--ADP, GDP, dTDP (12, 14, 25, 26)--and the nucleoside analog AZT-DP (27). These complexes show

(approximately 50 nM) (Fig. 2), revealing that the GDP Mg2 complex is able to enter the active site for activity or to form a dead-end complex, but not GDP itself. Mg2 was, as expected, needed for the second step of the reaction to take place, a fact that further supports the hypothesis that the low levels of NDP Mg2 are actually leading to the high autophosphorylation levels. Autophosphorylation of D. discoideum NDP kinase measured by quenching of steady-state fluorescence. To further study and characterize the autophosphorylation process, we took advantage of the fluorescence properties of D. discoideum NDP kinase. As previously shown, steady-state fluorescence studies indicate that the fluorescence of the unique tryptophan residue in D. discoideum NDP kinase is 20% quenched when the catalytic histidine is phosphorylated (20). Further addition of EDTA, lowering the free Mg2 , enhanced this quenching to 25% (Fig. 3), indicating a greater level of autophosphorylation. Very likely previous spectrofluorometric analyses were not performed with fully autophosphorylated enzyme (20), probably because of the difficulties in regulating the ADP/ATP ratio below 0.01, where small amounts of ADP contaminating ATP preparations would alter the expected ratio. Addition of EDTA could be an easy method for avoiding this problem. A methodology for obtaining complete autophosphorylation of NDP kinase was described previously and used by others and by us (19); this methodology involved an incubation with Mg2 in excess and the reaction was ``stopped'' by adding 10 mM EDTA. From the results presented here, it is clear now that in

FIG. 4. Intrinsic fluorescence of D. discoideum NDP kinase as a function of the ratio [ADP]/[ATP]. Wild-type NDP kinase (2 M subunit) was incubated in 50 mM Tris­HCl, 75 mM KCl, 5 mM Mg2 (s) or 0.25 mM Mg2 , 10 mM EDTA (F) at equilibrium with ATP and ADP (total DFmax r/(r Keq), where r amount of nucleotides 50 M, in varying [ADP]/[ATP] ratios). Data were fitted to the equation DF [ADP]/[ATP], DFmax is the maximum variation in fluorescence, and DF is the variation observed at a given ratio r. Data were standardized for common representation but DFmax corresponds to 18 to 20% enzyme phosphorylation in the presence of Mg2 (s) and to 23 to 25% enzyme phosphorylation in the absence of Mg2 (F) (see Fig. 3). The value for Keq is 0.19 0.02 in the presence of Mg2 (s); the equivalent value under low Mg2 is 1.6 0.30 (F). The hyperbolic function appears here as a sigmoid due to the logarithmic representation of the X axis.

that the enzyme interacts with the phosphates from the NDPs, which are particularly positioned by the interaction with the sugar 3 OH and the cation. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the Mg2 ion in the D. discoideum ADP Mg2 structure (25) interacts with nucleotide phosphates and with water molecules. One of these (marked with an asterisk) most probably occupies the place of the phosphate of the corresponding ATP; this is based on the position of the phosphate in the crystal structure of the phosphointermediate of the reaction (13) and on the AlF3 position from the NDP kinase­ NDP Mg2 AlF3 structure showing the transition state of the histidine phosphorylation (27). Therefore, in the NDP kinase­NTP Mg2 complex, Mg2 is expected to occupy the same position without a direct interaction with the protein. NDP kinase autophosphorylation in crude extracts. After verifying the autophosphorylation properties of homogeneous NDP kinase, we wondered if these same properties could be observed in crude extracts and whether other proteins would show the same behavior. Autophosphorylation assays under different conditions were performed with crude extracts from C. albicans yeast cells. When different amounts of Mg2 were added to the autophosphorylation assays (in the presence of 10 mM EDTA), only one protein was found to be

phosphorylated, as reflected by the presence of but one radioactive band (Fig. 6A). This phosphorylated polypeptide corresponded to autophosphorylated NDP kinase as determined by previously employed methodologies (16, 19): (i) the capacity of the phosphorylated intermediate to donate its phosphate to an NDP acceptor (Fig. 6D), (ii) Western blot analysis (Fig. 6E), and (iii) its lability to acid treatment (not shown). The behavior of the autophosphorylation process in crude extracts was similar to that observed with purified enzyme (Fig. 6). Maintaining constant EDTA and Mg2 concentrations (10 and 0.5 mM, respectively), we varied the ATP or GTP concentration from 1 to 50 M, observing that under these conditions NDP kinase was the only detectable phosphorylated protein in crude extracts after 5 min incubation, even with long exposure times of the gels (Fig. 6B and not shown). When a time-course experiment was performed, after 20 min of incubation another radioactive band was observed (see Fig. 6C); other bands appeared after 60 min incubation (not shown).
4. DISCUSSION

Autophosphorylation of NDP kinase is the first step of its enzymatic reaction to produce NTPs (Eq.

[1]), but it has also been described to be the necessary intermediate for its protein kinase activities (7, 8, 28). On the other hand, it is not needed for its DNA-binding activities (29). The role of Mg2 in the NDP kinase autophosphorylation process needed to be clarified. Here we verified that NTP Mg2 and NDP Mg2 were the only substrates of the reaction.

We also explained the fact that under very low Mg2 concentrations only autophosphorylation takes place; the second step of the reaction does not occur significantly because of the relative absence of NDP Mg2 . It was probably this low requirement of Mg2 that led to postulate that the first step of the reaction was independent of divalent cations (14, 18). Upon the addition of Mg2 , the greater availability of NDP Mg2 allows the reaction to proceed, therefore diminishing the autophosphorylation level; this effect had already been observed previously (18). The possibility of using steady-state fluorescence quenching to measure autophosphorylation of D. discoideum NDP kinase provided a powerful means for verifying the role of Mg2 in autophosphorylation and for quantifying the change in the equilibrium in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. It should be noted that the value obtained in the presence of excess of Mg2 (0.2) is the equilibrium constant of the reaction; this is not the case in the presence of EDTA because we do not represent the ratios of the real substrates (ATP Mg2 /ADP Mg2 ). A difference of one order of magnitude in the autophosphorylation equilibrium could already be presumed based on results obtained using [ -32P]ATP to follow the appearance of the phosphorylated intermediate. The two methodologies gave similar results in every aspect tested. It can also be concluded that autophosphorylation assays performed in the presence of EDTA provide an easy way to obtain complete autophosphorylation of NDP kinase. From the autophosphorylation equilibrium curves observed in Fig. 4, we can conclude that when assays are performed under conditions where the ATP/ADP ratio is between 0.11 and 1.10 the difference in autophosphorylation between the two conditions is greatest, reaching 50% at a ratio of 0.7.

Equal amounts (20 g protein) of crude extracts from C. albicans yeast cells were incubated with [ -32P]ATP, MgCl2, and EDTA at the concentrations indicated in each case at 4°C for 5 min (A and B) or for different times (C) as indicated.

Two results obtained during these studies seem to indicate that NDPs and NTPs are not binding the active site for activity nor to form dead-end complexes with affinities comparable to NDP Mg2 and NTP Mg2 complexes: (a) the GDP added under low free Mg2 concentrations did not diminish the autophosphorylation level compared to GDP Mg2 and (b) the autophosphorylation was found to proceed at 4°C in the presence of 104­105 times more ATP than ATP Mg2 . As the time course of autophosphorylation could be followed using the fluorescence quenching methodology at low Mg2 concentrations, further studies could provide precise quantification of the level of competition between ATP and ATP Mg2 for the active site. In contrast to the known structures of kinases and nucleotide binding proteins, in NDP kinase the divalent cation does not have any direct interaction with the protein. The results presented herein provide evidence of an indispensable role of Mg2 in the autophosphorylation process. During catalysis, Mg2 is stabilizing a negative charge of the leaving phosphate from ATP at the transition state (30), which should be the major cause for the lack of activity (and autophosphorylation) in the absence of Mg2 . The 3 OH residue of the sugar moiety is important if the nucleotide is to be a good substrate of NDP kinase (31). This residue is important in part due to its role during catalysis as previously discussed (31), but also the lack of the 3 OH has a 10-fold effect on the KD for NDP kinase (Schneider et al., J. Biol. Chem., in press), suggesting that it might play a role in stabilizing a particular structural conformation of the nucleotide. Our results, together with crystallographic data, could suggest also a role for Mg2 in the binding of the nucleotide to the active site. Both the presence of 3 OH in the nucleoside and a divalent cation might then be needed for efficient binding of the nucleotide to NDP kinase. Nevertheless, other possibilities cannot be ruled out and further investigation is necessary for a better understanding of the phenomena. It should be noted that several different divalent cations have been described to be effectively used by NDP kinase (32), so the effect of Mg2 on NDP kinase autophosphorylation should be applied to them as well. Nevertheless, differences may occur due to possible differences in the KDs of the different divalent cations toward the nucleotide triphosphates and diphosphates. The characteristics of NDP kinase autophosphorylation are not a very common feature. Shaul and co-workers described histidine phosphorylation of discrete proteins (five protein bands) in crude extracts obtained from different mammalian tissues incubated for 1 h in the presence of [ -32P]ATP and

EDTA (33). One of the proteins phosphorylated under these conditions was NDP kinase. Our results are in agreement with theirs, but stress the difference between NDP kinase and the other phosphorylated proteins in terms of the speed of the reaction, i.e., NDP kinase reaches complete phosphorylation before 1 min incubation under the conditions studied while other proteins need more than 10 times as much time. These other proteins might have in common a low binding of ATP to their active sites (compared to ATP Mg2 ). The results herein presented for NDP kinase might be of more general application to this other group of proteins.
