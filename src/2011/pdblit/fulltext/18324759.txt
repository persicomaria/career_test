We have previously shown N-arylnaphthamides can be potent inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs). N-Alkyl and N-unsubstituted naphthamides were prepared and found to yield nanomolar inhibitors of VEGFR-2 (KDR) with an improved selectivity profile against a panel of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. The inhibitory activity of this series was retained at the cellular level. Naphthamides 3, 20, and 22 exhibited good pharmacokinetics following oral dosing and showed potent inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the rat corneal model. Once-daily oral administration of 22 for 14 days led to 85% inhibition of established HT29 colon cancer and Calu-6 lung cancer xenografts at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively.
Angiogenesis is of importance to many normal physiological processes but also contributes to pathological disorders and, in particular, has implications in the growth and metastasis of solid tumors.1,2 Tumors smaller than 2 mm3 in volume acquire nutrients and oxygen via passive diffusion; however, in order for growth beyond this critical size, an increase in vasculature is required.3 Neovascularization results from a complex set of events involving a number of diverse stimuli; however, signaling induced by VEGFa is considered rate-limiting. VEGF drives the angiogenic cascade by promoting endothelial cell activation and proliferation and enhancing the migration and invasion of endothelial cells. Tumors can up-regulate VEGF expression or secretion via a number of pathways, including oncogene activation,4 loss of tumor suppressor function,5 and changes in oxygen levels.6 VEGF binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptors including VEGFR-2 (KDR) on endothelial cells, which initiates a dimerization event.7,8 The resulting conformational change induced in the receptor complex leads

to the propagation of intracellular signaling cascades that result in altered gene expression and cellular function. Inhibition of angiogenesis by blocking the VEGF signaling pathway has attracted considerable interest as an approach to anticancer therapy.9Indeed, this approach has recently been validated with the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, which has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer.10 In addition to biological-based antiangiogenics, many small-molecule KDR inhibitors are currently in clinical development11­13 and two inhibitors, sorafenib14 and sunitinib,15 have recently received approval for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Our program has targeted the development of small-molecule inhibitors of KDR, such as AMG 706 (N-(3,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1Hindol-6-yl)-2-(pyridin-4-ylmethylamino)pyridine-3-carboxamide, motesanib diphosphate).16 This compound was recently reported as a highly selective oral agent that is being evaluated for its ability to inhibit angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1­3.16 It is also under investigation for its potential direct antitumor activity by targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit) signaling. Motesanib diphosphate is currently in phase 2 development as a monotherapy in thyroid cancer and in combination with other anticancer therapies to treat patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. In the previous Article, we reported the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a series of N-arylnaphthamides (1, Figure 1).18 This scaffold provided access to low-nanomolar inhibitors of KDR and led to the identification of 2 (Figure 1), which demonstrated robust preclinical in vivo activity in a human tumor xenograft model. While efficacious in several in vivo models, this agent lacked a high degree of selectivity against several kinases. Of particular concern was inhibitory activity against the serine/threonine kinase (STK) Aurora B, a mitotic kinase that has been implicated in centrosome separation and spindle formation,19 and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK)

Lck, a member of the Src family that has been shown to have important roles in T cell receptor signal transduction.20 Furthermore, 2 possessed poor intrinsic physicochemical properties that included low aqueous solubility and high lipophilicity, as determined by cLogP (7.02).17 These features led to restricted cell permeability, which in turn limited inhibition at the cellular level. In the course of identifying 2, it was found that Ncyclopropylnaphthamide 3 (Figure 1) was a potent inhibitor of KDR and displayed a more restrictive selectivity profile against a small panel of kinases (Table 1). In addition to improved selectivity, the reduced cLogP of 3 was expected to translate into improved cellular permeability and a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. In an effort to gain insight into the origin of the improved selectivity profile of 3, we turned to the crystallographic structures of 218 and 3 within the catalytic domain of KDR. As illustrated in Figure 2, both inhibitors bind to the enzyme in a similar manner, wherein the nitrogen of the dimethoxyquinoline ring participates in a hydrogen-bond interaction with the backbone amide-NH of Cys919 of the hinge region. The naphthyl core, which is oriented orthogonal to the quinoline ring, is accommodated in the mostly hydrophobic ATP-binding cleft. The carbonyl and NH groups of the amide make two interactions with the backbone NH of Asp1046 and the side chain of Glu885, respectively. Inspection of the two crystallographic structures, however, reveals a large conformational change in the highly conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) loop. When complexed with 2 (Figure 2), KDR adopts an "inactive" kinase conformation and the DFG loop of KDR assumes a "DFG-out" conformation, allowing the p-Cl phenyl ring of 2 to penetrate into the extended hydrophobic pocket which exists between the N- and C-terminal regions (PDB accession code 3B8Q). This conformational change, wherein Phe1047 has shifted by about 10 Å, opens up this extended hydrophobic pocket which cannot be accessed when the enzyme is in the "active" conformation. In contrast, when complexed with 3 (Figure 2), the DFG loop is maintained in a "DFG-in" conformation, preventing interactions between the inhibitor and the extended hydrophobic pocket (PDB accession code 3B8R). Interestingly, while 3 is not able to leverage interactions in the extended hydrophobic pocket, it maintained the potent level of inhibition exhibited by 2. Herein, we describe the structure­activity

relationships and antitumor activity of N-alkyl and N-unsubstituted naphthamides.21 Chemistry The compounds described in Tables 2-3 were prepared by the general routes described in Scheme 1.21 Commercially available 6-hydroxynaphthoic acid (4) was heated in the presence of cesium carbonate and the appropriately substituted 4-chloroquinoline22 in DMSO to provide naphthoic acids 5a­c. The naphthamides of interest (6) were then accessed via conversion of the acid to the desired amide functionality. Alternatively, 6-hydroxynaphthoic acid (4) could be converted to naphthamide 7, which could then be transformed to the desired naphthamide (6) utilizing a modified Ullman procedure.23 Compounds wherein the 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline was replaced with a 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (i.e., 9) could be accessed in a similar manner. To this end, coupling of 6-hydroxynapthoic acid (4) with 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline24 in the presence of cesium carbonate provided naphthoic acid 8, which could subsequently be elaborated to the desired naphthamides of interest. Results and Discussion To evaluate the aforementioned hypothesis that the improved selectivity profile of 3 was a result of the inhibitor binding the enzyme in a "DFG-in" conformation, a number of N-alkyl substituted and N-unsubstituted naphthamides were prepared. It was anticipated that inhibitors containing sterically unencum-

bered amides would bind KDR in a similar conformation as 3. On the basis of previous work, initial structure­activity relationship (SAR) studies were investigated utilizing the 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline as the linker binding element. In addition to screening the naphthamides against a series of subfamilies of RTKs, including Tie-2 and c-Met, they were also screened against the NRTK Lck as well as the STKs Aurora A and B. Potency at the cellular level was evaluated by determining the inhibition of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation induced by either VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The cellular assay was carried out in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Inhibitors wherein the amide was either unsubstituted or substituted with small alkyl groups were generally well tolerated (Table 2). To this end, potent KDR inhibitors could be generated by incorporation of a linear alkyl group (14­16, 19­21), a cycloalkyl group (3, 10­12) or a branched alkyl group (13, 17). The cyclopropylamide 3 and the free carboxamide 22 delivered the most KDR enzymatic potency, while cycloalkylamides 11 and 12 were slightly less potent and tert-butylamide 18 was not tolerated and exhibited drastically diminished potency. As eluded to previously, 3 demonstrated an improved selectivity

profile when compared to naphthamide 2. With the exception of Aurora B and Lck, the selectivity profile exhibited by 3 was well maintained within the series. The only compounds tested that were less than 400-fold selective for KDR over Tie-2 and c-Met were 11, 12, and 18. Selectivity against Lck was less general; linear alkylamides 15, 16, and 19 as well as the small cycloalkylamides 3 and 10 demonstrated the highest degree of selectivity against Lck. With respect to Aurora B, compounds 12, 13, and 19 exhibited potent inhibition and were less than 6-fold selective for KDR over Aurora B. The kinase inhibitory activity of these compounds generally translated well into the inhibition of growth factor-dependent cell proliferation. With the exception of three compounds (12, 13, and 19) all of the compounds tested exhibited single-digit nanomolar inhibition of VEGF-driven HUVEC proliferation. The high lipophilicity of 2 led to limited cellular permeability, and this manifested itself in a relatively large shift (>15) between the enzymatic assay and the cellular VEGF-driven HUVEC proliferation assay. Carboxamide 22 and most of the N-alkylnaphthamides illustrated in Table 2 are considerably less lipophilic than 2 and in turn exhibited a smaller shift between the enzymatic and cellular based assays. Furthermore, with the

The improved physicochemical properties of the N-alkyl and N-unsubstituted naphthamides relative to 2 also manifest themselves in improved aqueous solubility. Compounds 3, 20, and 22 were considerably more soluble in 0.01 N HCl (>200 µg/mL) than N-arylnaphthamide 2 (1.1 µg/mL).25 Replacement of the dimethoxyquinoline nucleus was also investigated (Table 3). In general, modifications to this region of the molecule led to inhibitors that maintained a good selectivity profile but decreased potency in the VEGF-driven HUVEC assay. This trend is exemplified in Table 3 wherein replacement of the 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline with 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline and 7-methoxyquinoline resulted in inhibitors with diminished cellular potency. The exception to this trend were compounds containing the 7-methoxy-6-carboxamide quinoline core (29-31), which displayed similar potency to the respective compounds in the parent 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline series. This series of compounds maintained the moderate level of selectivity over Aurora B that was displayed by the 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline series. In Vitro Metabolic Stability and Pharmacokinetic Profiles. On the basis of their in vitro potencies, the metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic profiles of several inhibitors were evaluated. Illustrated in Table 4 are the in vitro stabilities and pharmacokinetic profiles following intravenous (iv) and oral (po) dosing in male Sprague­Dawley rats. With the exception of 30, all of the compounds examined demonstrated acceptable metabolic stability in rat liver microsomes (RLM CLin vitro < 50 (µL/min)/mg) and in turn exhibited low iv clearance (CL e 600 mL/(h · kg)). Compound 30, which demonstrated a higher rate of clearance in vitro (RLM CLin vitro ) 95 (µL/min)/mg), was cleared at a high rate (3,048 mL/(h · kg)) and in turn displayed a shorter plasma-elimination half-life (0.30 h). After oral dosing the compounds in the 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline series (3, 20, and 22) all demonstrated good bioavailability and exposure levels with a tmax in the range 1.6­2.5 h. In contrast, compounds 29 and 30 were less bioavailable and consequently exhibited diminished levels of exposure. Kinase Selectivity Profile. The inhibitory profiles of compounds 3, 20, and 22 were determined in a panel of in vitro

kinase enzymes. As illustrated in the form of a heat map in Figure 3, the selectivity profiles for these compounds were similar among the kinases that were examined. Each compound demonstrated broad activity against the human VEGFR family (Flt-1/VEGFR1 and Flt-4/VEGFR3), with 20 being slightly less potent against Flt-1 (73 nM). Comparable levels of inhibitory activity were observed for the VEGFR and structurally related platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family of kinases. In this regard, all three compounds exhibited potent inhibition of c-Kit, c-fms, and PDGFRR; however, no inhibition of Flt-3 was observed. This selectivity is likely due to a disparity in the gatekeeper residue present in each of these kinases. This residue influences the accessibility of the hydrophobic pocket that flanks the ATP binding site, and its size can be a key factor in controlling kinase selectivity. In KDR this residue is a valine, while in c-Kit, c-fms, and PDGFRR it is a threonine. However, the gatekeeper residue in Flt-3 is a phenylalanine (Phe691). The compounds were highly selective against a broad range of other unrelated kinases tested, including EGFR, Src, and p38 kinase. As a whole, the compounds showed lower levels of selectivity for Abl and members of the Src-B family, including Lyn and FGR. Compound 3 has moderate potency for Abl (IC50 ) 466 nM) and FGR (IC50 ) 396 nM) and showed strong inhibition toward Lyn (IC50 ) 27 nM). Compound 20 has a slightly improved selectivity profile and showed only modest potency against Lyn (IC50 ) 275 nM). Compound 22 displayed moderate potency against both Lyn (IC50 ) 88 nM) and Abl (IC50 ) 110 nM). In Vivo Inhibition of Vascular Permeability and Rat Corneal Angiogenesis. To confirm the results observed in the enzymatic assay and the VEGF-promoted HUVEC assay, the effects of 3, 20, and 22 were examined in a VEGF-induced

In the vascular permeability model, HEK293 cells overexpressing recombinant murine VEGF were cultured, suspended in Matrigel, and injected subcutaneously (sc) onto the ventral surface of CD-1 nu/nu mice.16 Twenty four hours after implantation, mice were dosed by oral gavage with either drug or vehicle. Six hours after administration of compound, vascular permeability was assessed by quantitation of Evans blue dye in a 1 cm2 piece of skin overlying the Matrigel plug. As illustrated in Table 5 and Figure 4, compounds 3, 20, and 22 significantly inhibited vascular permeability at doses of 10, 3, and 30 mg/kg, respectively.

To evaluate the antiangiogenic activity of 3, 20, and 22 in vivo, these compounds were examined in a rat corneal angiogenesis model (Table 6).16 Disks soaked with VEGF (10 µmol/L or BSA as a control) were implanted into a pocket in the corneal stroma of adult female Sprague­Dawley rats. The animals were dosed once daily (qd) with drug or vehicle. Following 7 days of treatment, the corneas were photographed and the number of vessels intersecting the midpoint between the disk and the limbus was measured. All three compounds inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in a dose-responsive fashion, with the lowest ED50 (0.01 mg/kg) being achieved with 3 (Figure 5). Compounds 20 and 22 each displayed an ED50 of 0.04 mg/kg (Table 6). While the efficacy and initial pharmacokinetic screening of 3 was promising, the presence of the cyclopropylamide was of some concern. It has been demonstrated that cyclopropylamines have a propensity to undergo P450-mediated bioactivation to electrophilic and/or free radical intermediates capable of covalently reacting with biomacromolecules and inducing a toxicological response.26 It is generally recognized that covalent binding of reactive intermediates to proteins is an initial and crucial event in the etiology of many chemical-induced toxicities.27 Hence, before evaluating 3 in an in vivo tumor growth setting, we evaluated 14C-labeled 3 for the formation of reactive metabolites in the presence of rat and human liver microsomes.28 Incubation of 14C-labeled 3 with human liver microsomes led to moderate levels of covalent binding (357 (pmol/mg)/h) in an NADPH-dependent manner, indicating that metabolic activation was occurring (Table 7). Furthermore, the addition of glutathione (GSH) as an exogenous trapping agent in the microsomal incubation led to an approximate 2.5-fold reduction in observed radioactivity, suggesting the formation of an electrophilic intermediate. In an effort to confirm that the metabolic activation of 3 was unique to this compound and was not common among other members of the naphthamide family, compounds 20 and 22 were also profiled in rat and human microsomal incubations for bioactivation. As is illustrated in Table 7, compound 20 displayed a moderate potential for NADPH-dependent metabolic activation in both rat and human microsomes. In contrast,

compound 22 showed low levels of covalent binding in both rat and human microsomes, revealing a lower propensity to form reactive metabolites. The exact nature of the reactive intermediate generated from 20 is currently unclear. The superior metabolic profile of 22 coupled with its promising in vivo efficacy led to an evaluation of its pharmacokinetic parameters in mouse, dog, and cynomolgous monkey (Table 8). Compound 22 demonstrated a moderate Vss and low rate of clearance in dog, whereas in mouse and cynomolgous monkey, a somewhat elevated Vss and higher rate of clearance relative to the hepatic blood flow for the respective species were observed. In each case, 22 was well absorbed following oral administration of drug from suspension formulations at the doses denoted in Table 8. The compound exhibited a moderate to slightly elongated half-life (t1/2) of 5.6-16 h across the three species. Favorable mean residence times (MRT) were observed in mouse and cynomolgous monkey, with the values being slightly elevated in dog. The measured oral bioavailabilities were acceptable in all species and ranged from 39% to 73%. In Vivo Tumor Xenograft Growth Inhibition. On the basis of its selectivity and promising pharmacokinetic profile across species, compound 22 was examined in the HT29 colon cancer and Calu-6 lung cancer xenograft models (Figure 6, Table 9). Cancer cells were implanted into the hind flank of female CD-1 nu/nu mice and allowed to establish for 12­14 days into sizable tumors, as determined by caliper measurements. In both xenograft models, once daily administration of 22 in OraPlus for 14 days led to antitumor efficacy in a dose-dependent fashion. In the HT29 xenograft model, 85% tumor growth inhibition was achieved at 10 mg/kg with an observed Cmax of 1.3 µM and AUC(0­24) of 3.9 µM · h. A similar level of tumor growth inhibition was seen in the Calu-6 model at a dose of 20

mg/kg. No overt toxicity as measured by weight loss or morbidity was observed at any dose level throughout the dosing regimen. Conclusion N-Alkyl and N-unsubstituted naphthamides were prepared and identified as potent and selective inhibitors of KDR. Their enzyme inhibitory profiles translated well into endothelial cells, as exemplified by nanomolar inhibition of VEGF-driven HUVEC proliferation. Naphthamides 3, 20, and 22 exhibited good pharmacokinetics following oral dosing in rats and showed potent inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the rat cornea. While compounds 3 and 20 suffered from metabolic activation and in turn led to moderate levels of covalent binding, 22 displayed a superior metabolic profile. Compound 22 showed a favorable PK profile in a range of species and once daily oral administration of 22 led to >85% inhibition of established HT29 colon cancer and Calu-6 lung cancer xenografts at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively.

final concentration of 1 µM. At 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min following addition of test compound, aliquots of the incubation mixture (35 µL) were collected into an equal volume of acetonitrile plus internal standard (1 µM tolbutamide). The samples were centrifuged at 3500g for 15 min and analyzed on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system consisting of two Shimadzu LC-10AD HPLC pumps and a DGU-14A degasser (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD), CTC PAL autoinjector (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC), and an API3000 LC-MSMS system. Chromatography was conducted on a Sprite Armor C18 (20 mm × 2.1 mm, 10 µm) analytical column (Analytical Sales and Products, Pompton Plains, NJ) with a 0.5 µm PEEK guard filter, using the following mobile phase gradient program: MPA ) H20 with 0.1% formic acid; MPB ) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid; 0 min ) 98% MPA, 2% MPB; 0.3 min ) 98% MPA, 2% MPB; 0.7 min ) 5% MPA, 95% MPB; 1.3 min ) 5% MPA, 95% MPB; 1.4 min ) 98% MPA, 2% MPB; 1.7 min ) end of run; approximately 2 min between sample injections. For each compound, peak areas at each time point were converted to the natural log of the percentage remaining relative to the 0 min samples.29 The resulting slope of these values relative to time (k) was converted to in vitro T1/2 where T1/2 ) -0.693/ k. CLint was calculated using the following relationship: CLint ) (0.693/T1/2)(1/0.25 mg/mL). In Vivo Vascular Permeability Assay. Vascular permeability was induced using a modified Miles assay30 and was conducted as previously described.16 Rat Corneal Angiogenesis Model. Corneal angiogenesis was evaluated in adult female Sprague­Dawley rats as previously described.31 Pharmacokinetic Studies. Male Sprague­Dawley rats were dosed via femoral vein (intravenous, DMSO solution, dose 1 mg/ kg) or via oral gavage (suspensions in OraPlus, pH adjusted to a range of 2.0­2.2 using methanesulfonic acid, dose 10 mg/kg). Concentrations of all formulations were selected to allow for dose volumes in accordance with the highest scientific, humane, and ethical principals as defined by IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees). Serial blood samples were collected from jugular vein into heparized tubes over a 12­24 h period. Plasma was separated by centrifugation, and the sample was prepared for analysis by protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Quantitation of the test compounds was accomplished by reverse-phase liquid chromatography with mass spectral detection in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with an appropriate internal standard. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life were calculated by a noncompartmental method. Tumor Xenograft Models. Both the Calu-6 and HT29 cell lines were originally obtained from ATCC. HT29 cells were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM high glucose, 5% FBS, 1× NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco/BRL, Grand Island, NY) under standard tissue culture conditions. In like manner, Calu-6 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 10% FBS, 1× NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco/ BRL, Grand Island, NY). CD1 nu/nu mice within approximately 4­8 weeks of age were challenged with subcutaneous implants of cultured HT29 (human colon carcinoma) or Calu-6 (human NSCLC) cells (1 × 107 cells per mouse). After 13-14 days, when tumors had reached approximately 300 mm3, animals began continuous daily treatment with compound 22 administered po, qd at the indicated dose levels. Tumor volumes as established by caliper measurements were recorded twice per week, along with body weights as an index of toxicity. Data are expressed as mean values plus or minus standard errors as a function of time. Statistical significance of observed differences was evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) followed by Scheffé post hoc testing for multiple comparisons. Covalent Binding Studies. Human and rat liver microsomes (20 mg/mL) were purchased from Xenotech, LLC (Lenexa, KS). NADPH and glutathione were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). H218O was ordered from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA), and SOLVABLE was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA).

Microsomal Incubations. 14C compound (10 µM) and liver microsomes (1 mg/mL) were mixed with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for a final volume of 0.5 mL. The samples were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and then 1 mM NADPH was added. The incubations were quenched with 1.0 mL of icecold acetonitrile after 60 min followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation. The supernatant was dried under a steady stream of N2 and reconstituted in the initial mobile phase described below. A 50 µL injection was made using the LCMS method described below. In Vitro Covalent Binding Assay. 14C compound (10 µM) was again incubated with liver microsomes (1 mg/mL), (()-glutathione (1 mM), 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and NADPH (1 mM) in a final volume of 0.2 mL The incubations were quenched with 0.4 mL of ice-cold acetonitrile after 60 min followed by vortex mixing, centrifugation, and removal of the supernatant. The pellet was washed three times with 80% methanol, twice with 3:1 ethanol/ ether, and twice with 80% methanol. The total radioactivity in the final supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting and was not more than background. The pellet was dried overnight and then solubilized in 0.5 mL of 60% SOLVABLE. The protein concentration was determined using a standard BCA protein assay, and 0.375 mL of the solubilized protein was used for liquid scintillation counting LCMS Assay. HPLC analyses were carried out on an Agilent 1100 gradient system (Palo Alto, CA). Separation was achieved on a Waters YMC ODS-AQ 4.6 mm × 150 mm column with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The gradient started at 95% A and linearly ramped to 50% A over 30 min. The flow was split so that 0.8 mL/min flowed through an INUS -RAM (Rivera Beach, FL; scintillation cocktail flow rate of 2.4 mL/min) and 0.2 mL/min flowed into a Thermo Electron ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ-Deca XP plus or LTQ; San Jose, CA). Protein Binding Assay. Plasma filtrate was used for the calibration curve and QC samples. To generate plasma filtrate, an aliquot of plasma was filtered through Millipore Centriplus (a filter) by spinning at 3000g (4980 rpm) at 4 °C for 24 h with a Beckman Avanti J-251 ultracentrifuge. An aliquot of 10 µL of test compound (1 mg/mL in DMSO) was added to 1990 µL of human, rat, dog, and mouse plasma to give a final concentration of 5 mg/mL (12.9 µM). Separate QC samples were prepared by adding 10 µL of the test compound spiked plasma sample (5 µg/mL) to 490 µL of plasma filtrate, in duplicate. The plasma samples including the QC samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Following incubation, 800 µL was transferred to the centrifuge tube (in duplicate) and spun at 120 000 rpm for 3 h at 37 °C with a TLA120.2 rotor (Optima TLX ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter). The top portion below the lipid layer of the centrifuged plasma sample was aspirated (100 µL in triplicate) for LCMS analysis. The QC samples (100 µL in duplicate) were also aspirated for LCMS analysis. The concentrations of the samples (n ) 6) and QCs (n ) 2) were determined from a linear regression of peak area ratios (analyte peak area/IS peak area) versus the theoretical concentrations of the calibration standards. The percent of binding was calculated as % protein binding ) 1 - (concentration of the centrifuged plasma sample) / (mean concentration of the QC) × 100
