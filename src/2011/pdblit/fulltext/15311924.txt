ABSTRACT: Cyclase-associated protein (CAP or Srv2p) is a modular actin monomer binding protein that directly regulates filament dynamics and has been implicated in a number of complex developmental and morphological processes, including mRNA localization and the establishment of cell polarity. The crystal structure of the C-terminal dimerization and actin monomer binding domain (C-CAP) reveals a highly unusual dimer, composed of monomers possessing six coils of right-handed -helix flanked by antiparallel -strands. Domain swapping, involving the last two strands of each monomer, results in the formation of an extended dimer with an extensive interface. This structural and biochemical characterization provides new insights into the organization and potential mechanistic properties of the multiprotein assemblies that integrate dynamic actin processes into the overall physiology of the cell. An unanticipated finding is that the unique tertiary structure of the C-CAP monomer provides a structural model for a wide range of molecules, including RP2 and cofactor C, proteins involved in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and tubulin maturation, respectively, as well as several uncharacterized proteins that exhibit very diverse domain organizations. Thus, the unusual right-handed -helical fold present in C-CAP appears to support a wide range of biological functions.

Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for motility, cytokinesis, and a range of morphological and developmental programs. These processes rely on the coordination of signaling pathways that regulate the site and timing of filament (F-actin)1 assembly, as well as the organization of individual filaments into higher-order structures. The cyclase-associated protein (CAP), also known as Srv2 in yeast, may provide one such linkage between the

cytoskeleton and diverse signaling pathways. CAP was initially identified by biochemical and genetic approaches as a component of the RAS-responsive adenylate cyclase complex in budding yeast (1, 2). A role for CAP in actin filament regulation was initially suggested by the observation that overexpression of profilin, a well-characterized actin monomer (G-actin) binding protein, suppressed the cytoskeletal defects associated with cap- cells (3). Yeast CAP is a 526-residue tripartite modular protein (Figure 1). The amino-terminal domain (N-CAP, residues 1-168) binds to adenyl cyclase in yeast, supporting RASdependent stimulation of the cyclase (4, 5), while in higher eukaryotes, the function of the N-terminus is unknown. The C-terminal domain (C-CAP, residues 370-526) binds Gactin with a 1:1 stoichiometry with an affinity in the range of 0.5-5.0 µM (6-8), and is responsible for oligomerization of the entire CAP molecule (6, 9). Separating the N- and C-terminal domains is a proline-rich stretch that supports the binding of multiple SH3 domains, including the SH3 domain from abl, and ABP1 (actin binding protein 1), a 65 kDa modular F-actin binding protein that is thought to be responsible for localizing CAP (6, 10). Two-hybrid data suggest a direct physical interaction between the N- and

Pro505 and Glu506 of the extended C-terminal tail are shaded in red.

C-terminal domains of CAP, even though the functions of the N- and C-termini are not directly coupled (9). Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of CAP appears to regulate the ability of the proline-rich linker region to bind SH3 domains, and may therefore be involved in regulating subcellular localization via interaction with ABP1 (11). There is also some suggestion that the N-terminal domain may directly contribute to proper localization (11, 12). The amino acid sequence of CAP is highly conserved, and CAPs from a number of organisms are capable of complementing the Saccharomyces cereVisiae null, implying widespread conservation of CAP function (13-16) (Figure 1). CAP has been implicated in a number of developmental and morphological processes, including RNA localization and the establishment of cell polarity (17). Yeast lacking CAP show considerable variability in shape and size, suggesting a loss of polarization, likely due to defective vesicle targeting. In addition, the localization of specific mRNAs to the daughter

bud is defective, perhaps due to a compromised cytoskeleton (18). In Drosophila, disruption of CAP results in a significant accumulation of filamentous actin and is associated with incorrect localization of specific mRNAs (18). Furthermore, during eye development in Drosophila, CAP defects lead to increased F-actin levels that are associated with alterations in cell morphology (19). Taken together, these observations in Drosophila suggest that the function of CAP is to limit the extent of actin polymerization. However, in mammalian cells, microinjection of CAP antibodies leads to a loss of stress fibers, while microinjection of CAP itself enhances stress fiber formation (20), suggesting that the role of CAP is to promote filament assembly. Recent biochemical studies suggest that CAP modulates filament turnover by regulating both barbed and pointed end dynamics (21). Here we describe the crystal structures of yeast and human C-CAP at 2.3 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. The structure reveals a novel type of parallel right-handed -helix,

10630 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 33, 2004 which forms an intertwined dimer via exchange of a C-terminal -hairpin. Competition assays with gelsolin, another G-actin binding protein, suggest that C-CAP binds in the proximity of subdomains 1 and 3 of actin. This unusual -helical structure provides a template for modeling a wide range of biologically and clinically important molecules, including cofactor C, a component of the tubulin-specific chaperone system, and the gene responsible for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XRP2). METHODS Protein Preparation. The cDNA for the C-terminal domain of S. cereVisiae cyclase-associated protein (C-CAP, residues 369-526) was PCR amplified and subcloned into the NdeIHindIII restriction sites of the pMW172 expression vector, which was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown for 18 h at 30 °C, without the addition of IPTG, and harvested by centrifugation at 10000g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in MEDA buffer at pH 7.0 (10 mM morpholinopropanesulfonic acid, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM DTT, and 0.02% sodium azide) and lysed by the addition of lysozyme, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min and sonication. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 16000g, and the supernatant was applied to a DE-52 column (Whatman, Madistone, U.K.) equilibrated with MEDA buffer. C-CAP was eluted with approximately 250 mM NaCl during the application of a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mM NaCl; appropriate column fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 4 M NaCl in MEDA buffer, and applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). C-CAP eluted at 0.6 M NaCl during the run of a linear gradient from 4 to 0 M NaCl; appropriate column fractions were pooled, dialyzed against MEDA buffer, and concentrated using Amicon Centriprep 10 concentrators. Selenomethionyl-substituted protein was expressed using the E. coli Met auxotroph B 834 (DE3) system after induction with 1 mM IPTG at 30 °C and purified as described for the native protein. The C-terminal domain of human CAP1 (residues 319475) was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)Lys STAR cells (Invitrogen) as a fusion to the full-length human GSTM2 containing a PreScission protease cleavage site (unpublished data). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.3, and expression was induced by the addition of 1.0 mM IPTG. Cells were grown for an additional 6 h at 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation (12000g), and resuspended in 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT (loading buffer). Pancreatic DNase I (100 units/mL) was added to reduce viscosity. Cells were frozen at -70 °C and thawed at room temperature. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 30000g, and the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-agarose (Sigma) column equilibrated with loading buffer. The column was washed with 20 volumes of wash buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1.0 M NaCl] and then in 3 volumes of loading buffer. PreScission protease (Pharmacia) was added to the column (80 units/mL of beads), mixed with resin, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Human C-CAP was eluted from the column using the same loading buffer, dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and concentrated as described above. Full-length Dictyostelium discoideum cyclase-associated protein (Dicty-CAP) was PCR amplified and cloned into the

Dodatko et al. BamHI-SalI restriction sites of the pGEX-6P-2 vector, which was used to transform E. coli BL(21)DE3. Cells were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.7-0.9, and expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were grown for an additional 4-5 h at 20 °C, harvested by centrifugation (10000g), and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT (working buffer). Thereafter, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1/10 volume of 10 mg/ mL lysozyme (Sigma), and 130 units/mL DNase I were added. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged for 45 min at 30000g, and the supernatant was incubated for 1-2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with the same buffer (2 mL of 50% slurry beads/L of culture). The resin was washed with at least 50 bed volumes of working buffer, followed by 10 volumes of cleavage buffer [50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA]. CAP was released by cleavage with PreScission protease (80 units of protease/bed volume of GS matrix, 16 h at 4 °C) and eluted with cleavage buffer. CAP was further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and concentrated. Actin Binding Competition between Gelsolin and CAP. Protein samples were mixed, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and applied to 10 to 20% gradient Tris-HCl electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) under native conditions. The sample buffer contained 5% DTT (1 M), 0.06% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol. The running buffer consisted of 192 mM glycine and 25 mM Tris buffer. Gels were run for 6 h at 40 V and stained with Coomassie Blue. S. cereVisiae C-CAP Crystallization. Crystals of S. cereVisiae C-CAP were produced by hanging drop vapor diffusion using a reservoir solution composed of 16% PEG 4000, 250 mM lithium sulfate, and 200 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6). Yeast C-CAP (10-20 mg/mL in MEDA buffer) was mixed with an equivalent volume of reservoir solution, and equilibrated over 1 mL of reservoir solution. Crystals with a tetragonal bipyramidal morphology and a maximum dimension of 0.3 mm on their longest axis appeared within several days. Before being flash-cooled to -170 °C, yeast C-CAP crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant composed of mother liquor supplemented with 15% glycerol. These crystals diffracted X-rays to 2.3 Å resolution under cryogenic conditions at beamline X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). Diffraction from these crystals is consistent with either orthorhombic space group I222 or I212121 [a ) 56.52 Å, b ) 86.81 Å, and c ) 160.21 Å; two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Matthews coefficient of 3.4 and 64% solvent content)]. Crystallographic Data Collection, Phasing, and Model Refinement. A self-rotation function using POLARRFN (22) revealed the orientation of a noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) 2-fold axis (CCP4 convention,  ) 270.5°,  ) 45.0°,  ) 180.0°; XPLOR convention,  ) 90.5°,  ) 45.0°,  ) 180.0°). A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected (inflection ) 0.9790 Å, edge ) 0.9788 Å, and remote ) 0.9416 Å) using inverse beam geometry at -170 °C with a Quantum4 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). The raw diffraction data were processed with the HKL suite of programs (23) (Table 1). The locations of the two selenium atoms per C-CAP subunit (totaling four

The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entry 1K4Z. Secondary structure assignment was based on the Kabsch-Sander algorithm [PROCHECK (26)], but with the extra criteria that all residues must have the appropriate ( and ) angles as well as being hydrogen bonded. Crystallization and Data Collection for the Human C-CAP Structure. Crystals of human C-CAP were grown at 16 °C by sitting drop vapor diffusion in the presence of 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.5), 27.5% PEG 4000, 0.2 M sodium acetate, and a protein concentration of 12-24 mg/mL. Tetragonal rodshaped crystals reached a maximal length of 1 mm and a width of 0.2 mm in 4-7 days. For data collection, crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen after being soaked in mother liquor supplemented with 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. X-ray data were collected to 2.8 Å resolution under cryogenic conditions using a Rigaku RU-200 X-ray generator coupled to a RIGAKU R-AXIS IV image plate. Data were reduced and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK, yielding an overall completeness of 95% and an Rmerge value of 5.9%. The unit cell dimensions were as follows: a ) 82.64 Å, b ) 83.12 Å, and c ) 99.96 Å (with a pattern of systematic absences consistent with a P21 21 21 space group). Molecular Replacement and Refinement of the Human C-CAP Structure. Molecular replacement was carried out using the strand-exchanged yeast C-CAP dimer as the search model and X-PLOR (version 3.851). The cross-rotation function, followed by PC refinement protocols, using data in the 15.0-4.0 Å resolution range, yielded two clear solutions corresponding to separate homodimers in the asymmetric unit. A subsequent translation function search and rigid-body refinement produced a model with an initial Rfree of 0.52 and an R of 0.47. At this point, the yeast sequence was replaced with that of human C-CAP, and multiple rounds of refinement using strict NCS values yielded R and Rfree values of 0.24 and 0.28, respectively. Manual adjustment of the model and additional rounds of refinement, using 15 935 reflections (/F cutoff ) 2.0) in the 10.0-2.8 Å resolution range, yielded a final model with R and Rfree values of 0.232 and 0.268, respectively, with rms deviations for bonds of 0.005 Å, for bond angles of 1.34°, and for improper angles of 0.64° (Table 2). The quality of the final model was verified by PROCHECK (26), and all residues are within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with 81% in the most favorable regions. Small-Angle X-ray Scattering. SAS experiments were conducted on Biophysics Collaborative Access Team (BioCAT) undulator beamline 18-ID at the Advanced Photon Source. Samples were exposed to focused X-rays (12 000 ( 20 eV, 1 × 1012 photons/s) for 12.2 s, using a specimen-detector distance of 2.78 m. Two-dimensional scattering patterns were obtained using a 5 cm × 9 cm CCD detector (60). For exposure, a 100 µL sample was contained in a 1.5 mm diameter borosilicate glass capillary and oscillated at 4 µL/s using a programmable syringe pump (Hamilton model 541C) to control radiation damage. Scattering over a range of q from 0.004 to 0.13 Å-1 was calculated from radial integrations of the two-dimensional scattering patterns using the routines in the FIT2D data analysis program (Hammersley 1998, Fit2D version 9.129

Phases and electron density maps were calculated with SOLVE, and the map was improved by solvent flattening using DM (22). Utilizing methionine residues 439 and 508 as fiducial markers, the entire C-CAP sequence (155 consecutive residues) was manually fit to the 3.0 Å resolution solvent-flattened MAD map. The MAD map (Figure 2) was of sufficient quality that 2-fold NCS averaging did not produce significant improvement. Higher-resolution native data (2.3 Å) were collected with native crystals at a low temperature (-170 °C) using synchrotron radiation (wavelength ) 1.04 Å) coupled to a MAR345 image plate detector on beamline X9B at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Table 1). Refinement was performed with XPLOR and CNS (25), and included NCS restraints, including several rounds of simulated annealing refinement, conventional positional refinement, individual temperature factor refinement, and manual model building.

Reference Manual, ESRF Internal Report ESRF98HA01T). Integrated scattering profiles from sample with buffer and buffer alone were scaled using incident flux values integrated over the exposure time. The experimental radius of gyration (Rg) was calculated conventionally as the square root of -3 times the slope from plots of ln(I) versus q2, where I is the difference in intensity in scattering patterns from the sample in buffer minus the buffer alone. Rg of the crystallographic model was calculated as (imiri2/imi)1/2, where ri is the distance between each mass element (mi) and the center of mass. RESULTS Structure of S. cereVisiae C-CAP. The structure of S. cereVisiae C-CAP was determined by multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) using selenomethionyl-substituted protein and 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging (Figure 2 and Table 1). The central core of the C-CAP monomer is composed of six coils of right-handed parallel -helix, termed coils 1-6, which form an elliptical barrel (major axis, 22 Å; minor axis, 10 Å; based on R-carbons) with a tightly packed interior (Figures 2 and 3). Each -helical coil is composed of three relatively short -strands, designated a-c, separated by sharp turns (Figure 3). If on adopts the nomenclature utilized for pectate lyase (27, 28), the archetypal -helical structure, the a-c strands form three parallel -sheets that are denoted PB1, PB1a, and PB2, respectively. The individual strands are designated by their order of

appearance within a given coil (i.e., the third strand in the fourth coil is identified as c4). Flanking the central -helical core is an N-terminal -strand, 0, that packs antiparallel to the core, and strand 7 packs antiparallel to the core near the C-terminal end of the parallel -helix. The resultant mixed -sheets, 0a1a2a3a4a5a6 and c1c2c3c4c5c6 7, are extensions of sheets PB1 and PB2, respectively, of the parallel -helical core. The C-CAP monomer also contains a remote -hairpin, composed of antiparallel -strands 8 9, which extends away from the -helical core (Figure 2). PB1 and PB2 in C-CAP are structurally equivalent to PB1 and PB2, respectively, of pectate lyase (Figures 2 and 3), while the equivalent of PB1a is absent in pectate lyase. The C-CAP -helix exhibits considerable regularity, as the -strands in sheet PB1 contain four to five residues, all strands in PB1a are composed of two residues, and the strands in PB2 are composed of four to six residues. Individual strands in PB2 are connected to PB1 of a subsequent coil of the -helix by a loop that ranges from four to six residues in length. The three individual -strands within a coil are separated by a single residue that adopts a left-handed R-helical (RL) conformation. These RL residues have a dramatic effect on local structure as they result in a 90° alteration in the main chain direction. The number of residues in a single -helical turn in C-CAP varies from 19 to 22, with an average of 20 residues in a complete turn, and a mean separation of 4.9 Å between adjacent coils. This organization results in an average rise per residue of 0.24 Å, which closely approximates a perfect circular parallel -helix with 22 residues per turn and a 0.22 Å rise per residue. The six -helical turns in C-CAP superimpose with a root-mean-square displacement of 1.2 Å for equivalent R-carbon positions (excluding residues in the loop regions), highlighting the regularity of the core structure. Stabilization of the C-CAP Fold. The C-CAP -helix is supported by the near-ideal interstrand main chain hydrogen bonds, within the PB1, PB1a, and PB2 parallel -sheets, which are oriented parallel to the -helical axis. This arrangement directs the side chains of alternate residues within the strands toward either the solvent or the hydrophobic core of the molecule (Figure 3). Significant main

FIGURE 3: Features of the right-handed -helix family. (a) Arrangement of residues in a -helical turn of C-CAP. Each -helical turn contains a four- or five-residue -strand (labeled a) that contributes to sheet P1, a two-residue -strand (labeled b) that contributes to sheet P1a, a four- to six-residue -strand (labeled c) that contributes to sheet P2, and a variable loop connecting turns of subsequent layers. Within individual turns of the -helical core, strands are separated by single residues in the RL conformation. For every turn, the first residue of the b -strands contains a hydrophilic side chain (Ser, Thr, or Cys) that hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of the fourth residue of the a -strands. The second coil of the -helix is displayed. (b) Comparison of the backbone topology of one -helical turn among different right-handed -helical families demonstrates that the shape of the C-CAP cylindrical shaft is unique. The members of the alkaline protease family (for example, PDB entries 1kap and 1sat) contain two -strands per -helical turn, labeled a and c. The members of the pectate lyase family (for example, PDB entries 2pec and 1idk) contain three -strands per -helical turn as a consequence of the addition of -strand d. C-CAP also contains three -strands per -helical turn as a consequence of the addition of the topologically distinct -strand b. The members of the galacturonase family (for example, PDB entries 1rmg and 1bne) contains four -strands per -helical turn, by the addition of -strands both b and d.

chain hydrogen bonding interactions are also present between the loop segments that join adjacent coils in the -helix. Two such hydrogen bonds connect coils 1 and 2, coils 2 and 3, and coils 3 and 4, while coils 4 and 5 are connected by three main chain hydrogen bonds between the respective loop segments. The hydrophobic core of the C-CAP -helix is formed by the packing of the PB1 and PB2 sheets against each other. These sheets contribute small aliphatic side chains, predominately Val, Leu, and Ile, such that the distance between equivalent R-carbon atoms of these two sheets is 10 Å. When viewed down the axis of the parallel -helix, the side chains of PB1 and PB2 appear to abut each other; however, when viewed perpendicular to the axis of the -helix, the side chains of both sheets are interdigitated with each other. The -helix exhibits an extraordinary alignment of hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains both in the interior and on the surface of the molecule. This arrangement is a consequence of the interstrand main chain hydrogen bonding interactions that align -carbon atoms from adjacent -strands above each other. Within the core of the yeast C-CAP -helix, this registration results in the formation of extensive stacks of small aliphatic side chains, including Ile381-Ile403Leu422-Val441-Ile460, Ile401-Ile420, Ile458-Ile479, Leu391Val411-Val430-Ile449-Ile468-Val489, and Ile393-Ile413Leu432-Val451-Leu470-Leu491. Of particular note is the interior stack of Cys406-Thr425-Ser444-Ser463-Ser484 hydrophilic residues. All of these polar residues are located in

the first position of the b strands that form the PB1a sheet and are accommodated by specific hydrogen bonding interactions. Cys406 and all three serine residues donate hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of residue i - 2, which is the last residue in the a strands that form the PB1 sheet. Careful examination of the electron density corresponding to Thr425 reveals a side chain rotamer conformation that does not support interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of residue 423 but, instead, suggests hydrogen bonding interactions with side chain of Ser444 in the adjacent coil. Notably, in all CAP sequences, the identity of the first residue in strand b within coils 2-6 is restricted to Ser, Thr, or Cys, indicating that the detailed hydrogen pattern observed in the yeast protein is a general feature of the entire CAP family. This structural motif of stacked, buried hydrophilic residues along one side of the cylindrical shaft is also well-documented in other -helical structures (28, 29). Several other polar side chains, including those of Cys428, Ser435, Ser474, Thr477, and Asn490, are buried to an extent of g95%, and are accommodated in the hydrophobic core by interactions with main chain carbonyls or side chain hydroxyls. Two water molecules are buried inside the hydrophobic core of the C-CAP -helix. The first water is hydrogen bonded to main chain Gly415 O, Asp433 N, and Ser434 O atoms, and connects two adjacent coils of the -helix. The second internal water is hydrogen bonded to main chain Cys428 N and Asn445 O atoms and the side

10634 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 33, 2004 chain of Thr425. Both of these internal water molecules are independently observed in the two NCS-related C-CAP molecules. The antiparallel elements that flank the parallel -helical core are a consequence of specific interactions. The tight two-residue turn that promotes the antiparallel disposition of strands 0 and a1 contains the highly conserved Gly376, which adopts an unusual backbone conformation ( ) 73.3° and  ) -113°) required to accommodate this chain reversal. This antiparallel topology is supported by an ionic interaction between Arg371 and Glu382 in strands 0 and a1, respectively. At the C-terminus of the -helical core, a second chain reversal directs the antiparallel interaction between strands c6 and 7. This change in main chain direction begins at the nearly invariant Pro492 and continues into a loose six-residue turn. In the yeast protein, this chain reversal is stabilized by a "herringbone" aromatic-aromatic interaction between Tyr469 and Tyr499, and possibly by an ionic interaction between Lys472 and Asp497 that connects strand 5c with the loop between strands 6c and 7. As described below, this chain reversal is functionally significant as it allows 8 9 to be situated distal to the -helical core and thus indirectly supports the formation of the physiological dimeric species. C-CAP NCS Dimer Structure. The asymmetric unit of the yeast C-CAP crystals contains two molecules, related by proper 2-fold noncrystallographic (NCS) symmetry (Figure 4). The -helical axes of the two monomers are antiparallel to each other and perpendicular to the NCS 2-fold axis. This interface buries 934 Å2 of total accessible surface area and is stabilized by three direct polar interactions [Asn418 OD1-Asn418 ND2, Ser437 O-Asn37 ND2, and Ser437 O-Lys378 NZ (the prime denotes contributions from the symmetry-related molecule)], as well as additional water-mediated hydrogen bonds. No hydrophobic interactions are observed between the two NCS monomers. The two NCS-related monomers are very similar, as all 157 R-carbon pairs superimpose with an rms deviation of 0.28 Å, with only the loop segment composed of residues 493-498 exhibiting substantially different conformations in two NCSrelated monomers due to lattice contacts. C-CAP Strand-Exchanged Dimer Structure. Two crystallographically related C-CAP monomers exchange their remote -hairpins (antiparallel strands 8 9), resulting in an intimate "strand-exchanged dimer" that buries a total accessible surface area of 2558 Å2 (Figure 4). When viewed perpendicular to the crystallographic 2-fold axis, the dimer resembles the letter V. The front and backsides of the V-shaped molecules are composed of seven-stranded and nine-stranded -sheets, respectively, with the cavity being bounded by the symmetry-related PB1a -sheets, and the external sides formed by six parallel loops on each monomer. Viewed down the crystallographic 2-fold axis, this intertwined dimer exhibits a serpentine or S-shaped organization, with 2-fold symmetry-related concave and convex surfaces. The concave surfaces are composed of nine-stranded mixed -sheets formed by the 0a1a2a3a4a5a6 8 9 strands, and the convex surfaces are composed of the seven-stranded mixed -sheets containing the c1c2c3c4c5c6 7 strands. The formation of the strand-exchanged dimer is a consequence of the polypeptide segment (residues 505-508) connecting -strands 7 and 8, which adopts an extended

Dodatko et al. conformation and results in the placement of the 8 9 hairpin distal to the core of the -helix. This placement allows 8 to participate in extensive antiparallel hydrogen bonding interactions with strand a6 in the PB1 sheet of the symmetryrelated monomer. In addition to the a6 8 and a6 8 main chain hydrogen bonds, the strand-exchanged dimer is further stabilized by the contribution of 13 predominately hydrophobic residues from each 2-fold related monomer (Leu475, Ile479, Val489, Leu491, Ile493, Phe502, Ile504, Pro505, Met508, His510, Phe512, Phe517, and Val521). The 8 9 hairpin and its symmetry mate cross at the crystallographic 2-fold axis, which is centered on Glu506 and Gln507 and Glu506 and Gln507 of the exchanged strands. The exchanged strands do not participate in -sheetlike main chain hydrogen bonds in this central crossover region. The exchanging strands participate in hydrophobic interactions involving Ile504-His510, Pro505-Met508, and their symmetry mates, and Met508-Met508. Several main chainside chain hydrogen bonding interactions may also contribute to the stability of the dimer. The side chain of Glu506 interacts with the main chain amide nitrogen of Ala486 in the sixth coil of the -helix, and the Gln507 side chain forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Ile460 O and Tyr480 O contributed by the fifth and sixth coils of the symmetryrelated molecule, respectively. Consistent with the roles of residues 505-507 in stabilizing the strand-exchanged dimer, Pro505 is absolutely conserved in all known species; position 506 allows the conservative substitution of only glutamate or glutamine, and with only a single exception, Gln507 is invariant. The PB1a -sheets exhibit only a single interaction in the 2.3 Å yeast structure, a disulfide bridge formed by Cys483 and Cys483. However, given the cytoplasmic disposition of CAP and the presence of a Lys at this position in all other members of the CAP family, this is not likely to be a physiologically relevant disulfide linkage. Furthermore, this disulfide is not observed in other structures (data not shown), indicating that the observed disulfide is an artifact resulting from oxidation after crystallization. The artificial nature of the observed disulfide is also consistent with the behavior of freshly prepared material on reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Validation of the C-CAP Dimer. As the strand-exchanged yeast C-CAP exhibits a rather unusual dimer interface, we sought independent confirmation. Small-angle X-ray scattering data are fully consistent with the strand-exchanged dimer, as the experimentally determined radius of gyration (Rg ) 24.2 Å) compares favorably with that calculated from the yeast C-CAP dimer structure (24.1 Å) (Figure 5). Further validation of the strand-exchanged dimer was provided by the structure of human C-CAP, which was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 2.8 Å resolution (Table 2). Crystals of human C-CAP contain four monomers in the asymmetric unit, which form two dimers displaying the same quaternary organization observed for the strand-exchanged yeast dimer. The two strand-exchanged human C-CAP dimers superimpose with an rms deviation of 0.6 Å for all atoms, and like the yeast dimer buries 2600 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area. The human and yeast C-CAP also exhibit extensive detailed similarity, as the monomers and dimers superimposed with rms deviations of 0.9 and 1.2 Å between backbone atoms, respectively (Figure

Dodatko et al. Yeast two-hybrid analysis also suggested that the actin binding surface of the cyclase-associated protein includes residues 499-526, located at the extreme C-terminus of the protein, as deletion of these residues results in the loss of the observed interaction (9). On the basis of this structure, this interpretation must be carefully reconsidered, as these same residues direct the formation of the strand-exchanged CAP dimer, and are responsible for "capping" the hydrophobic interior of the -helical core. Thus, the loss of actin binding activity in the two-hybrid assay may be the consequence of a structurally compromised CAP molecule, and not due to direct disruption of the actin binding surface. Further functional insights may be gleaned from the physical properties and distribution of solvent accessible amino acids. The concave (i.e., the 0a1a2a3a4a5a6 8 9 sheet) and convex (i.e., the c1c2c3c4c5c6 7 sheet) surfaces that form the sides of the dimer are characterized by the presence of a considerable number of acidic groups as judged by an examination of the electrostatic potential (Figure 4c). Likewise, the top of the strand-exchanged dimer also exhibits a clustering of anionic groups, while the bottom of the dimer appears to be considerably less ionic in nature, with contributions of only a few basic groups (Figure 4d). Several highly conserved residues, including Val431, Gln450, Tyr469, Thr485, Asn488, Glu501, Glu506, and Gln507, form a semicontinuous patch on the convex surface, while the concave surface has a somewhat more punctate distribution of highly conserved residues, including Lys378, Glu382, Phe402, Ile436, Asp440, and Pro456 (Figure 4e,f). While it is likely that these conserved patches represent binding surfaces for interacting proteins (or domains), existing data do not allow the identification of G-actin or N-CAP binding sites. The C-CAP structure also provides some insight into the organization of the multicomponent assemblies that may contribute to the formation and regulation of filamentous actin assemblies in ViVo. The relative placement of the conserved surface features with respect to the molecular-2fold axis of the strand-exchanged dimer would allow each monomer to bind an independent actin monomer, and is consistent with biochemical studies demonstrating that CAP associates with actin in a 1:1 (monomer:monomer) stoichiometric complex (6-8, 35). Recently published structural and biochemical data indicate that N-CAP also forms a dimer (36). Moreover, biochemical isolation of mammalian CAP from porcine platelets (7), HEK293 cells (21), and S. cereVisiae (37) reveals that CAP and actin form a highmolecular weight complex containing multiple actin and CAP molecules. The current structural and biochemical observations, including the dimeric properties and binding activities of N-CAP and C-CAP, the placement of the C-CAP N-terminus, and the likely binding of C-CAP in the vicinity of actin subdomains 1 and 3, all provide significant constraints for the organization of the actin-CAP assembly and the mechanisms by which it regulates actin filament dynamics. The quaternary features of CAP also impact the function of a wide range of actin regulatory proteins involved in actin filament nucleation, severing, and localization. In yeast, CAP and ABP1 colocalize to cortical actin patches, which are centers of active actin polymerization that target sites of polarized cell growth (6, 10). These proteins also appear to

6). In total, these findings support the validity of the observed strand-exchanged dimer and suggest that this C-CAP quaternary organization is conserved throughout evolution. Biochemical Assessment of the C-CAP-Actin Interaction. Native gel analysis was used to perform competition assays to map the C-CAP binding surface on the actin monomer. Gelsolin segment-1 (S1), a well-characterized actin binding module, has been shown by direct crystallographic observation to bind a hydrophobic cleft formed by subdomains 1 and 3 on the actin monomer (30). Figure 7 demonstrates that CAP and S1 compete for binding to G-actin. The most parsimonious interpretation is that C-CAP contacts a surface in the proximity of subdomains 1 and 3, which is similar to or overlaps with the S1 binding site (Figure 7). This interpretation is also consistent with the observation that the C-CAP-G-actin complex interacts with DNase I, which binds tightly to subdomain 2 of G-actin. Homology Modeling. With the sequence of yeast C-CAP as the starting point, a cascade of PSI-BLAST (31) searches was performed using the Saturated-BLAST protocol (32). An e-value threshold of e - 5 was used for the automatic acceptance of new members of the family, and belowthreshold similarities were accepted only if verified by FFAS (33), a sensitive profile-profile comparison algorithm (32). DISCUSSION Implications for CAP Function. Several models have been proposed for the organization of the CAP dimer (34). The work presented here convincingly supports a parallel dimer, involving domain swapping in the C-terminal domain, which is consistent with the tripartite domain organization of the full-length cyclase-associated protein. The disposition of the amino termini in the strand-exchanged dimer would direct the beginning of the proline-rich domain away form the -helical core, running nearly orthogonal to the -helical axis. The considerable conformational plasticity likely associated with this low-complexity segment may allow N-CAP to physically contact C-CAP, and would be consistent with yeast two-hybrid data showing an interaction between the two domains (9); however, these observations cannot distinguish whether the interaction between these two domains is inter- or intramolecular.

FIGURE 7: Interaction between CAP and G-actin. (a) Native polyacrylamide gel analysis demonstrates that gelsolin competes with CAP in Vitro: lane 1, actin; lane 2, gelsolin S1 domain; lane 3, gelsolin-actin complex (24 and 16 µM, respectively); lane 4, CAP; lane 5, CAP and gelsolin (10 and 24 µM, respectively) showing no interaction; lane 6, CAP-actin complex (24 and 24 µM, respectively). Competition between CAP and gelsolin for G-actin is demonstrated in lanes 7-9, which contain 1:1.5:1.3, 1:1.5:2.0, and 1:1.5:2.3 G-actin:gelsolin:CAP stoichiometries, respectively.

be involved in dynamic cytoskeletal events in mammalian systems, as the mammalian homologues of CAP and ABP1 accumulate in the lamellipodia of motile cells. Furthermore, ABP1 has been shown to localize to sites enriched in the Arp2/3 complex, the major engine for de noVo nucleation of actin filaments (15, 38). This latter observation is particularly striking, as recent reports have demonstrated that ABP1 can serve as a direct activator of Arp2/3-catalyzed filament nucleation (39). In addition, recent structural analysis of the N-terminal cofilin homology domain of ABP1 suggests that under appropriate circumstances ABP1 may exist as a dimer (Strokopytov and S. C. Almo, unpublished data), further adding to the geometric and organizational complexity of the assemblies associated with CAP function. The functional interaction between CAP, ABP1, and Arp2/3 suggests the possibility of a multicomponent F-actin nucleating assembly that could provide a link to SH3-mediated signaling pathways. Furthermore, in addition to the specific ABP1-mediated activation of Arp2/3, the G- and F-actin binding activities of CAP and ABP1, respectively, suggest additional levels of Arp2/3 modulation. This situation is further enriched by biochemical linkage of CAP and filament severing protein cofilin, as well as the recently described two-hybrid interaction between CAP and Aip1 (40), a protein that modulates cofilin-mediated actin filament severing by capping and preventing annealing of severed ends. Thus, the emerging structural analyses are beginning to define the organizational principles that direct the structural, biochemical, and mechanistic features of the multicomponent as-

semblies that integrate Arp2/3 function into the overall physiology of the cell. Topological Comparison to Other Members of the RightHanded -Helical Family. A number of parallel -helix family members have been reported, including pectate lyase (27), pectin methylesterase (29), the tail spike protein of phage P22 (41), the IGF-1R domain (42), the bacterial cell division inhibitor MinC (43), chondroitinase B (44), pertactin (45), galacturonase (46, 47), alkaline protease (48, 49), and the TmAFP antifreeze protein (50). In contrast to the elliptical, almost rectangular C-CAP, the majority of these structures display "L-shaped" cross sections (Figure 3). The alkaline protease and TmAFP antifreeze protein are the only other family members that exhibit nearly elliptical cross sections; however, the detailed disposition of strands within their -helices differs significantly from that observed in C-CAP. The alkaline protease -helix has only the equivalent of -sheets PB1 and PB2, which are nearly antiparallel to each other. In C-CAP, the additional -sheet PB1a runs approximately perpendicular to both PB1 and PB2. The TmAFP antifreeze protein exhibits the smallest -helix with only 12 residues per helical coil. Like C-CAP, TmAFP contains nearly perpendicular -sheets PB1 and PB1a; however, it lacks sheet PB2, which is replaced by a short loop that connects PB1a with the next coil. Galacturonase, despite its L-shaped cross section, is the right-handed -helix most similar to C-CAP, as both structures have -sheet PB1a, nearly perpendicular to sheets PB1 and PB2, and in both structures, all strands in -sheet PB1a consist of two residues.

The major difference between these two structures is the presence of the additional fourth -sheet PB3, and an additional residue in the RL conformation that connects PB2 and PB3 in galacturonase. EVolutionary Relations. Detailed sequence analysis suggests that the C-CAP -helical core may represent the structural archetype for a wide range of biologically diverse proteins (Figure 8). More than 30 proteins that are homologous over a span of approximately 100 amino acids were identified. Two subfamilies, which are characterized by their sequences and domain architecture, account for the majority of the homologues. Several uncharacterized proteins from plants, animals, and lower eukaryotes with diverse domain architectures account for the remaining homologues (Figure 8). The most intriguing homology is that between C-CAP and the C-terminal domain of cofactor C (90 amino acids), a GTPase-activating component of the tubulin-folding supercomplex (51, 52), which directs the assembly of the R- and -tubulin heterodimer (Figure 8). This same domain is also present in the N-terminus of RP2, the protein responsible for X-linked forms of retinitis pigmentosa, a disease characterized by severe retinal degeneration (53). Remarkably, the homology model of RP2 and the experimental C-CAP structures exhibit the same "internal Ser/Cys stack" in the first position of the b strands that form the PB1a sheet, which supports the validity of the RP2 model (Figure 9). Importantly, a significant fraction of the clinically relevant RP2 mutations are located in the C-CAP/cofactor C-like domain, and the RP2 model allows a number of the disease-associated mutations to be rationalized. Several insertion and/or deletion mutations, such as the 13 bp insertion at Cys110, the 2 bp insertion at Phe117, and the 1 bp insertion at Arg123, result not only in frame shifts but also in premature terminations, likely resulting in the production of nonfunctional polypeptides (54-56). A 3 bp deletion at Ile137 preserves the reading frame, but results in the removal of a single amino acid in the middle of a strand that contributes to the putative PB1 sheet, and likely results in global destabilization (53, 55, 57). A point mutation at Arg120 directs premature termination, which would effectively remove the last coils of the putative RP2 -helix (56), exposing the hydrophobic core to solvent, and thus yield a defective polypeptide that is unable to fold properly. Independent point mutations involving the alteration of Cys67 and Cys86 to Tyr are predicted to result in a defective protein due to the imposition of a large bulky

FIGURE 9: Homology model of RP2. The homology model of RP2 exhibits the same basic -helical motif present in the yeast and human C-CAP molecules. The internal Cys/Ser ladder, which is shared by RP2 and C-CAP, is highlighted in a space filling representation (sulfur shaded orange).

aromatic residue at highly conserved positions of the "internal Ser/Cys stack" which contributes to the hydrophobic core of RP2. The Cys108Gly mutation may result in a destabilized protein due the introduction of a "hole" in the middle of the tightly packed RP2 hydrophobic core. The homology observed between cofactor C and RP2 might have functional significance as this domain in RP2 has recently been suggested to play a role in tubulin biology (54). RP2, apart from having the C-CAP/cofactor C-like domain, possesses both a microtubule-associated-like domain (MAP-like) and a guanine exchange factor-related domain (GEF-related), both of which are involved in microtubule biogenesis (54). Recent studies have shown that both cofactor C and RP2 stimulate the GTPase activity of tubulin (58). Moreover, this activity is abolished in both proteins by mutation of the equivalent of Arg118 in RP2, which is highly conserved in RP2 and cofactor C. Importantly, the naturally occurring Arg118His (53, 55, 57) and Arg118Leu (54) point mutations in RP2 are correlated with the disease state. This residue is thought to function in a manner analogous to that of the "arginine fingers" present in GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) to trigger the GTPase activity of tubulin

10640 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 33, 2004 (58), suggesting that the defect associated with this mutant is due to the loss of essential function and not a consequence of compromised protein structure or stability. While the equivalent of Arg118 is not conserved throughout the entire extended family, variation at this position is clearly restricted and does not exist within subfamilies, suggesting that C-CAP homologues bind to a small number of well-defined targets. It is notable that the C-CAP/cofactor C-like domain is present in several other uncharacterized proteins, which also contain a number of additional domains, suggesting that many signaling pathways utilize this cytoskeleton-related motif. SUMMARY The C-terminal oligomerization and G-actin binding domain of the cyclase-associated protein (C-CAP) is a new member of the right-handed -helical superfamily. An intimate parallel dimer is formed by domain swapping, involving the exchange of the two C-terminal -strands. These structural features, in combination with the biochemical properties of C-CAP, place significant constraints on the organizational, mechanistic, and regulatory features relevant to CAP function. Moreover, the unique -helical core observed in C-CAP provides a useful structural model for functional domains found across a wide range of proteins with relatively modest levels of sequence homology, including RP2 and cofactor C, the proteins involved in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and the maturation of tubulin, respectively.
