Olfactory marker protein (OMP) is a ubiquitous, cytoplasmic protein found in mature olfactory receptor neurons of all vertebrates. Electrophysiological and behavioral studies demonstrate that it is a modulator of the olfactory signal transduction pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the solution structure of OMP, as determined by NMR studies, is a single globular domain protein comprised of eight b-strands forming two b-sheets oriented orthogonally to one another, thus exhibiting a "b-clam" or "b-sandwich" fold: b-sheet 1 is comprised of b3 ­b8­ b1 ­b2 and b-sheet 2 contains b6­ b5 ­b4 ­ b7. Insertions include two, long a-helices located on opposite sides of the b-clam and three flexible loops. The juxtaposition of b-strands b6 ­ b5­ b4 ­b7­ b2 ­b1­ b8 ­b3 forms a continuously curved surface and encloses one side of the b-clam. The "cleft" formed by the two b-sheets is opposite to the closed end of the b-clam. Using a peptide titration series, we have identified this cleft as the binding surface for a peptide derived from the Bex1 protein. The highly conserved V-loop structure adjacent to the Bex1 peptide-binding surface found in OMP may be the site of additional OMP ­protein interactions related to its role in modulating olfactory signal transduction. Thus, the interaction between the OMP and Bex1 proteins could facilitate the interaction between OMP and other components of the olfactory signaling pathway.

Olfaction is critical for such life-sustaining processes as reproductive/maternal functions, neuroendocrine regulation, emotional responses, recognition of predators and prey, and food selection. The basic mechanisms of olfactory transduction and neural processing are highly conserved in all vertebrates. Odorants are detected and these signals transduced to electrical activity by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) located in the neuroepithelium of the nasal cavity. ORN axons, which form the olfactory nerve (ON), terminate in the olfactory bulb where they synapse on output neurons that process and subsequently transmit this information to higher-order olfactory centers and to other cortical and sub-cortical structures that integrate olfactory information with other inputs.1 ­ 6 Olfactory marker protein (OMP) is an abundant, 18.6 kDa cytoplasmic protein expressed almost

exclusively in mature ORNs and in their cilia in essentially all vertebrate species. It is present throughout the cytoplasm from the ciliary lumen to the synaptic terminals in the olfactory bulb.7 ­ 18 OMP expression is phylogenetically conserved,8,11,19 ­ 22 developmentally regulated,7,8 ­ 10,14 and its appearance is temporally associated with ORN functional maturation. OMP has been cloned from rat, mouse, human21,23 and Xenopus.22 Rat and Xenopus OMP share ca 55% sequence identity with nearly half the remaining differences reflecting conservative replacement. In addition, data mining from the genomic databases has enabled us to identify genomic sequences in two fish species (puffer fish, Tetraodon nigroviridis AL232200.1, AL240167.17, and zebra fish, Danio rerio BF938258.1), whose deduced partial amino acid sequences correspond to OMP (Figure 1) and which share ca 50% identity with the mammalian OMPs. The two fish species OMPs have an amino acid triplet insertion that is absent from other species. Two regions of the OMP are virtually

identical across all six species studied (corresponding to amino acid residues 80 ­ 102 and 122 ­148 in rat). In addition, several individual amino acids are identical across all the species. This strict conservation of primary sequence and localization of cellular expression over ca 400 million years of evolution attests to the importance of OMP in olfaction. There is no evidence for OMP-like open reading frames (ORFs) in the fully sequenced genomes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Genbank), the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Sanger Center C. elegans BLAST server), or the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster (Flybase). Nor have we ever obtained any immunocytochemical evidence for the existence of any OMP-like molecule in a wide range of invertebrate eukaryotes. Together, these observations imply that OMP arose during evolution after insects and before bony fish and suggest that the role of OMP may be related to vertebrate olfactory function/transduction specifically. This is consistent with its presence in olfactory neurons in the nasal olfactory

neuroepithelium, in the vomeronasal organ, as well as in the septal organ of Masera,24 the only three sites where olfactory neurons reside.25 In addition, structure and regulatory elements of the OMP gene are conserved across several species.21,26,27 However, a search of the various databases does not uncover any obvious amino acid sequence motifs in OMP such as a zinc finger28,29 or a calcium-binding EF hand.30 OMP is not glycosylated,7 does not exhibit any endogenous enzymatic activity,7 and is not subject to phos-

phorylation by a variety of systems.8 This absence of any identified functional motifs in the OMP primary sequence has hindered the rational design of experiments to determine its function. To overcome this deficit and to address the question of OMP function in vivo, OMP-null mice were generated by homologous recombination.31 Characterization of these OMP-null mice has provided the first insights into the function of this unusual protein. Electro-olfactograms (EOGs) of the neuroepithelium of OMP-null mice are characterized by

slower response and recovery kinetics compared to controls. The EOGs also demonstrate that the ability of the OMP-null mice to respond to repeated odor pulses is compromised.31,32 In addition, behavioral studies have shown that while the OMP-null mice can discriminate various odor stimuli, their odor detection threshold is 50 ­100-fold higher than in controls,33 and their odor quality perception is compromised.34 The OMP-null phenotype can be rescued by infection of the ORNs in OMP-null mice with an OMP adenovirus, confirming that the null phenotype derives directly from the absence of OMP.32 However, the axon conductance velocity from the neuroepithelium to target neurons in the olfactory bulb is unaffected in the OMP-null mice.35 Cumulatively, the evidence for biological function, and the conservation of gene structure and amino acid sequence among vertebrates, coupled with more recent indications that OMP is mitogenic to ORN precursors,13,36 argue that OMP is a novel modulatory component of the olfactory signal detection/transduction cascade. To search for an interacting protein partner for OMP we screened a phage-display library prepared from olfactory tissue37,38 (and M. Behrens et al., unpublished results). We identified a phage that expressed the first two-thirds of a brain-expressed X-linked (Bex) protein sequence39 ­ 41 that interacted with OMP. There are three members of the Bex

protein family, one of which, Bex3, is implicated in p75NTR-mediated apototic signal transduction.42,43 Therefore, to gain additional insight into OMP's function in olfactory stimulus detection and transduction, not apparent from consideration of its primary sequence alone, we report the three-dimensional structure of OMP in solution and identification of the ligand-binding site for a peptide derived from the Bex1 protein.

Results
OMP structure As we reported previously, secondary chemical shifts44 were used to identify extended regions of secondary structure in rat OMP in solution.45 In summary, two a-helices and eight b-strands were identified at Q10-D18 (b1), L21-Q34 (a1), E50-D56 (b2), N69-D73 (b3), G76-T83 (b4), L100-K109 (b5), A114-N118 (b6), L123-K134 (a2), V138-T144 (b7) and N153-Q162 (b8). Table 1 lists the NMR experiments collected on samples of natural abundance and isotopically labeled OMP. Here, analysis of data from the 2D NOESY, 3D HNHA, 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 3D 15N,15N-edited HMQC-NOESY-HSQC, 4D 15N,13C-edited NOESYHSQC and the 4D 13C,13C-edited NOESY-HSQC data sets were used as input for calculations to

describe the three-dimensional solution structure of OMP. Linewidths of resolved resonances in the onedimensional 1H spectrum of OMP are the same as those measured for proteins with molecular masses between 16 and 21 kDa, e.g. staphylococcal nuclease and S100B(bb), and thus OMP behaves as a monomer under our solution conditions. The OMP fold is stable in solution for extended periods (. one year) based on the invariance of 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra recorded on the same samples. OMP has 58 long-lived (texchange . 0.5 hour) backbone amide protons, 27 of which do not exchange after more than a week in 2H2O at room temperature or after several hours at 50 8C. Hydrogen exchange data resulting from the hydrogen bonding network of the b-strands in OMP are shown in Figure 2. These non-exchanging amide protons located on strands b1­ b5, b7 and b8 persist due to the hydrogen-bonded antiparallel arrangement of these b-strands in the core of the OMP structure. The solution structure of OMP is presented in Figure 3. OMP is a single globular domain protein comprised of two b-sheets oriented orthogonally to one another, thus exhibiting a "b-clam" or "b-sandwich" fold.46,47 The b-clam core is a compact structure with overall dimensions of approxi° ° ° mately 14 A £ 16 A £ 24 A. Insertions include two, long a-helices located on opposite sides of the b-clam and three flexible loops; b-sheet 1 is comprised of b3 ­ b8­ b1 ­b2 and b-sheet 2 contains b6 ­b5 ­ b4­ b7. Other structural features include a

type I b-turn formed by residues between antiparallel b-strands 5 and 6, and a b-hairpin loop between antiparallel b-strands 7 and 8. b7 is shared between the two b-sheets, since it is hydrogen-bonded to b4 within b-sheet 2 and to b2 in b-sheet 1. Consequently, a continuously curved surface is formed by the juxtaposition of b-strands b6 ­b5 ­ b4­ b7 ­b2­ b1 ­b8 ­ b3, thereby enclosing one end of the b-clam. The cleft formed by the two b-sheets is opposite to the closed end of the b-clam noted above. The opening to the cleft between the b-sheets is outlined by the C terminus of b2, loop 2, b3, the b-turn, b6, a2 and the N terminus of b7. Regions of disorder are present in the structure of OMP and include the first nine N-terminal residues and three long loops located throughout the sequence. They are: loop 1 (R35-A49), between a1 and b2; loop 2 (F57-W68), between b2 and b3; and loop 3 (S84-L99), between b4 and b5. Resonance broadening is known to arise from slow conformational exchange on the NMR time-scale.48,49 Evidence that the disorder within these loops derives from slow conformational exchange is the absence of backbone amide correlations for residues G42, Q61, Q85 and N93, as well as significantly lower intensities for the backbone amide resonances of K39, Q40, D41, K44, D66, W68, T88 and M95 in the 1H ­ 15N HSQC.45 Further, the residues of loops 1, 2 and 3 do not have Ca or Cb chemical shifts significantly different from random coil values (see Supplementary Material) and thus, do not adopt stable secondary structures.

Figure 4. Demonstration of OMP­ Bex interaction. Microtiter plate wells were coated with either recombinant OMP or Bex1 and, after blocking with BSA, were incubated with the reciprocal protein. After several washes to eliminate non-specific binding, the wells were eluted with the protein initially bound to the plate OMP (0.5 mM) or Bex1 (1.3 mM) or with 1% (w/v) SDS. The protein eluted from the plate was analyzed by Western blot for OMP or Bex. Note that Bex displaces some of the Bex bound to OMP-coated wells and that OMP displaces some of the OMP bound to the Bex-coated wells but that SDS is a much more effective displacer. This is consistent with a low micromolar Kd value for the interaction of Bex1 and OMP.

Interestingly, loop 3 is the most highly conserved region of the protein sequence and, unlike extended loops 1 and 2, can be classified as an V-loop based on the overall similarity to the Greek V and to its reversal of chain direction.50,51 The OMP structure can be detailed as follows. The N-terminal residues, E3-Q9, have the sharpest resonances in the 1H ­ 15N HSQC and thus, are rotating freely in solution.45 These are followed by the first b-strand, b1 (Q10-D18), which exhibits long-range NOEs to b8 and b2. Residue Q19 links b1 to the first a-helix, a1 (D20-Q34). Our NOE data are consistent with D20, not L21 as previously reported,45 as the first residue of a1. Although well ordered, the residues of a1 have only four, weak, long-range NOEs, including two NOEs to residues V16 and D18 on b1 within the b-clamshell core. The flexible loop 1 (R35-A49) is C-terminal to a1 and, similar to a1, exhibits only one, weak, longrange NOE to the b-clamshell core, i.e. between G42 and V71. Several residues in loop 1 (K39-G42, K44) are exchange-broadened due to their conformational mobility.52 ­ 54 Additionally, preliminary analysis of OMP data from the steady-state 15 N ­ {1H} NOE experiment55 indicates the presence of fast internal motions for the apical residues of loop 1 (data not shown). These properties result in a paucity and weakness of observable long-range NOE correlations for residues in this region of the

structure. Consequently, the disposition of a1 and loop 1 in relation to the b-clam core of the molecule is not well defined under our solution conditions. Further, the backbone amide protons of loop 1 are quickly exchanging (texchange , six minutes) and 14 of the 31 residues forming a1 and loop 1 have charged side-chains at pH 6.6 and thus, are required to be solvated. b2 (E50-D56) follows loop 1 and its nonexchanging backbone amide protons (Figure 2), and long-range NOEs are consistent with its antiparallel arrangement between b1 and b7. Following b2 is a flexible linker, loop 2 (F57-W68), leading to b3 at the opposite end of b-sheet 1. Apical residues of loop 2 (I58-L63, F65) have backbone amide protons in rapid exchange with solvent and distal residues (D66, H67) have slowly exchanging backbone amide protons due, in part, to the proximity of H67 to V159 in b8 (Figure 2). Despite having random coil backbone chemical shift values and either medium or medium-weak HNHa(i, i 2 1) NOE correlations, residues D66 and H67 exhibit seven medium-weak or weak longrange NOEs to residues V158-N161 in b8. Based upon the observation of these long-range NOEs for D66 and H67, along with their non-exchanging backbone amide protons, we describe D66 and H67 as exhibiting nascent b-strand character. b3 (N69-D73) is antiparallel and hydrogen-bonded to b8. Residues K74 and P75 connect b3 to b4 (G76-T83) and position b4 within b-sheet 2. The non-exchanging backbone amide protons and long-range NOEs of b4 are consistent with its placement between b5 and b7 in b-sheet 2. The V loop 3 (S84-L99), located on the surface of the protein connects b4 to b5 with chain reversal to align b5 antiparallel to b4. Because of its solvent accessibility, the backbone amide protons of V-loop 3 are all rapidly exchanging. The residues of V loop 3 have 14 weak to very weak long-range NOEs to the N terminus of b2 and the C terminus of b7. V loop 3 terminates at b5 (L100-K109). b5 exhibits long-range NOEs to b4 and has one nonexchanging backbone amide proton through its hydrogen-bonding to b4, located in the interior of the b-clam core, and faster-exchanging backbone amide protons hydrogen-bonded to b6, located at the solvent-exposed end of b-sheet 2. A type I b-turn connects b5 to b6 (A114-N118). Due to additionally assigned NOEs, the second a-helix, a2, now includes A120. Alpha-2 (A120-K134) proceeds from b6 and is an amphipathic helix. The side-chains of four of its hydrophobic residues (A122, F125, L129, L132) point into the cleft of the b-clam shell and those of its hydrophilic residues (D121, E124, E127, R128, D131, K134) extend into solution. This helix, together with a short linker comprised of residues I135-K137, positions the next b-strand, b7 (V138-T144), on the side of b4, opposite to that of b5, to complete b-sheet 2. The non-exchanging backbone amide protons of b7 and its long-range NOEs to b4 and b2 are consistent with its placement between strands on

opposite b-sheets. The b-hairpin loop formed by residues F145-A152, inserts b8 (N153-Q162) between b1 and b3 to complete b-sheet 1. The C terminus of OMP remains structured through Q162, the last residue within b8 and the penultimate residue in the sequence. OMP/Bex1 interaction As noted earlier,37,38 (and M. Behrens et al., unpublished results) we used T7 phage display to identify the Bex protein39 as an OMP binding partner. We have confirmed this observation by demonstrating that the recombinant Bex and OMP proteins interact in a solid-phase binding assay (Figure 4). The small amount of each that is displaced by 0.5 mM OMP or 1.3 mM Bex1 compared to the amount released from the interacting complex by SDS indicates that the protein ­ protein binding affinity is in the low micromolar range. In order to probe this interaction on a molecular level, two peptides spanning the N terminus and middle regions of the Bex1 primary sequence were synthesized. These Bex1-derived peptides, dissolved in buffer identical with that of the OMP protein, were used to titrate solutions of uniformly 15 N-labeled OMP. Recording chemical shift perturbations throughout the titration of a protein with a peptide is a commonly used technique for identify-

ing protein residues that form the peptide-binding surface.56,57 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra were recorded at each titration point to monitor changes in backbone amide chemical shifts. Of the two, only the peptide containing Bex1 residues 50 ­75 caused OMP chemical shift perturbations upon titration, indicating a ligand-binding interaction. Changes in the backbone 1H and 15N chemical shifts of OMP caused by interaction with Bex1 peptide 50­ 75, are shown in Figure 5. Analysis of the titration curves for perturbed resonances establishes a lower bound of 150 mM for the Kd value of the OMP/Bex1 peptide 50­ 75 complex (data not shown). Although this interaction is relatively weak, the resultant chemical shift changes and are measurable (lDHN ppml . 0.05 lDN ppml . 0.1) and reproducible. Further, we note that in addition to the Bex1 peptides, we had previously titrated samples of OMP with a wide variety of potential ligands and observed no chemical shift perturbations in its 1H ­ 15N HSQC. Residues of OMP exhibiting the largest average chemical shift changes (lDHN ppm þ DN ppm)/ 2l . 0.15) include Q10, N69, V78, K109, E110, A114, D116, W117, N118, E119, A122, S130, G148

interaction with Bex1 peptide 50 ­75 and thus ° likely part of the primary interface, is 33 A. Additionally, the arrangement of residues along this surface is such that several negatively charged, peptide-interacting residues (E110, D113, D116, E119 and D121) form a stretch spatially disposed to electrostatically interact with the six N-terminal Arg residues of the Bex1 peptide 50 ­75 (Figure 6).

Discussion
OMP has been identified as a participant in the olfactory signal transduction cascade.31 ­ 34 The primary amino acid sequence of OMP is highly conserved across several species from fish to human and exhibits little or no homology to any other sequences in the databases. Until now, its three-dimensional structure and interacting protein partner(s) have been unknown. We now describe the OMP structure in solution and identify its Bex target protein-binding surface in order to gain insight into the role of OMP in olfaction on a molecular level. The solution structure of OMP is described by a b-clam fold, reported for numerous other functionally unrelated proteins.52,53,58 ­ 60 The b-clam core of OMP is comprised of two fourstranded, antiparallel b-sheets with two long a-helices located on opposite sides of the b-clam. The OMP b-clam fold belongs to the large structural domain of all-b proteins with a jellyroll topology.61,62 Comparison of the OMP structure with those in the FSSP database reveals topological similarities to proteins from a wide range of functionally unrelated families, including peptidylglycine a-hydroxylating monooxygenase,63 viral coat proteins64 and, notably, the amino-terminal ligand-binding domain of the EphB2 receptor.65 Despite the lack of stringent topological similarity between OMP and the crystal structure of the  EphB2 receptor (RMSD ¼ 3:7A for 94 pairwise Ca distances), the disposition of the V loop 3 in the solution structure of OMP is strikingly similar to that of a long loop between b-strands H and I in the EphB2 receptor (Figure 7). From mutagenesis studies, this H-I loop in the EphB2 receptor has been implicated in ligand-binding and class specificity.65 Since V loop 3 in OMP is so highly conserved throughout evolution, and since it has a similar disposition to that of the ligand-binding loop of the EphB2 receptor, we speculate that one consequence of the b-clam fold may be to present V loop 3 as part of the putative OMP ligandbinding epitope in additional OMP ­ protein interactions. Recently, a member of the Bex protein family has been shown to interact with and to be co-expressed with OMP in olfactory receptor neurons.37 Our solid-phase binding assay has revealed that OMP and full-length Bex1 form a complex with low micromolar affinity.38 The site of the OMP-Bex1 peptide 50 ­75 interaction has been identified through a titration series. The ligand-binding site

The H-I ligandbinding loop in (a) and the V-loops in (b) and (c) are colored green. For comparison, the NMR-derived and X-ray-derived OMP structures were superimposed onto that of the EphB2 receptor with minimization of 85 pairwise Ca distances between the EphB2 receptor and OMP structures. The molecules are shown individually, while maintaining their alignment from the minimization. The RMSD values for the minimizations were ° ° 4.17 A and 3.03 A for NMR and X-ray, respectively.

and L163. Although scattered throughout the primary sequence, and located on different secondary structural elements (b1, b3, b4, b5, the b-turn, b6 and a2), each of these residues of OMP is clustered about the opening to the cleft between the two b-sheets. This opening contains nine out of the 14 residues mentioned above that are the most affected by Bex1 peptide 50­ 75 binding, i.e. N69 in b3, E110 in the b-turn, A114, D116, W117, N118 in b6, E119 between b6 and a2, and A122, S130 in a2. The distribution of these residues in the OMP three-dimensional structure, as well as others, which displayed significant chemical shift changes during the titration, is shown in Figure 6. The Bex1 peptide 50­ 75 appears to have an ordered solution structure and some helical content, evidenced by the presence of . 10 dNN connectivities involving the N-terminal Arg residues in its 2D NOESY spectrum (data not shown). The dimensions of the OMP peptide-binding surface are adequate for interaction with a 26 residue ° helical peptide (39 A canonical length). The distance between residues D111 (bottom of the cleft) ° and Q60 (top of the cleft) is 38 A, while that between E110 (bottom of the cleft) and S130 (top of the cleft), among residues most affected by

(b) Pairwise distances between Ca atoms in the average NMR-derived and the X-ray-derived structures of rat and mouse OMP, respectively. For (a) and (b), distances between pairwise Ca atoms were measured after minimization of the RMSD between the Ca atoms in the eight b-strands (residues 10 ­ 18, 50 ­ 56, 69 ­ 73, 76 ­ 83, 100­ 109, 114 ­ 118, 138­ 144 and 153­162) in the structures being compared.

is located on one side of the b-clam and encompasses the entrance to the cleft formed by the two antiparallel b-sheets. The dimensions of this open° ° ing (approximately 38 A long and 10 A wide) are sufficient to accommodate an interaction with a putatively helical Bex1 peptide 50­ 75. Further, the possibility of numerous electrostatic attractions between the side-chains of the N-terminal Arg residues of the Bex1 peptide 50­ 75 and those of E110, D113, D116, E119 and D121 of OMP likely anchor the N terminus of the peptide at the bottom of the OMP cleft (Figure 6). One unexpected observation is that the V loop 3, between strands b4 and b5, contains the most highly conserved amino acid sequence of the entire protein and is virtually identical across 400 million years of evolution. The conservation of this sequence in a loop at the protein surface with little apparent structure suggests that it plays a critical role in the function of OMP and may relate to other interactions of this protein. V loop 3 is adjacent to the site of Bex1 peptide 50 ­75 interaction but is not a part of this binding surface. Omega loop structures have been described as participants in protein function and molecular recognition in other systems,51 and flexible loops have been demonstrated to be essential for the biological activity of many enzymes.66 ­ 68 At this time we have no insight as to its actual role in OMP function but it may achieve a defined conformation on interaction with a target ligand or protein in analogy to the "induced-fit" model of enzyme catalysis proposed many years ago by Koshland.69

Alternatively, the interaction of OMP with a ligand(s) may shift the equilibrium distribution of OMP conformers to increase the population of OMP conformers with a more defined V loop structure, as has been proposed recently for the phosphorylation-driven activation of functional states of the signaling protein NtrC.70 Additionally we note that V loop 3, as well as other regions of OMP, may have interactions with other residues present in the full length Bex1 protein (residues 1­ 128) since the solid-phase assay indicates a Kd value in the low micromolar range (# 150 mM) for OMP and full-length Bex1, whereas OMP and Bex1 peptide 50 ­ 75 has Kd $ 150 mM. The Bex1 primary sequence contains a potential C-terminal isoprenylation site or CAAX box.71 Post-translational isoprenylation of proteins targets them from the cytosol to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.72 It may be that the interaction of OMP and isoprenylated Bex proteins provides a means to bring OMP into proximity to the components of the olfactory signal transduction machinery at the plasma membrane. The exact mechanism by which the interaction of OMP and Bex proteins helps modulate the olfactory signal transduction cascade is not clear. However, it may be that OMP and Bex are analogous to other interacting pairs of proteins, e.g. cytoplasmic Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor and isoprenylated Rab GTPase73 that act to escort proteins to and from various subcellular membrane compartments. In addition, the prenylation of several proteins involved in signal transduction in retina71 is consistent with this postulated role of Bex in regulating olfactory signal transduction. In this regard, it is worth noting that one member of this family, Bex3, participates in p75NGF-R-mediated apoptosis signal transduction.74 Comparison of the NMR and crystal structure of OMP The crystal structure of mouse OMP has been ° solved at 2.3 A resolution.75 The b-clam fold in the solution and crystal structures of OMP is identical. Specifically, the topology of the eight b-strands and the orthogonal arrangement of the two  b-sheets is the same in each. An RMSD ¼ 2:13 A is measured between the solution and crystal forms for the Ca atoms of residues in the b-sheets. Figure 8 depicts the pairwise distances between Ca atoms in the NMR-derived and the X-ray-derived structures. Excluding the unconstrained N terminus of the protein, the largest Ca distances are found for residues in a1, loop 1 and V loop 3 (residues D20-A49, S84-L99). In the solution structure of rat OMP, loop 1 and V loop 3 are located on the surface of the protein (see Figure 3). The residues in these loops have rapidly exchanging backbone amide protons, broadened or missing resonances in the 1H ­ 15N HSQC, and only weak long-range distance constraints to the b-clam core of the molecule. These properties are consistent with

832

OMP: a b-Clam Fold

loop 1 and V loop 3 being conformationally mobile in solution. In the NMR ensemble of structures, the average RMSD between the Ca atoms of residues in ° a1, loop1 and V loop 3 is 1.92 A compared to ° 0.67 A for the Ca atoms of residues in the b-sheets. Nevertheless, the family of V loop 3 NMR conformers retains topological similarity to the ligandbinding loop of the EphB2 receptor. In the NMR solution structure, the highly conserved V loop is exposed to solvent as it is in the EphB2 receptor (Figure 7). By contrast, in the crystal structure (achieved with . 80 mM Zn2þ), the V loop is partially buried by the a-helical projection at residues D18-R47. The largest RMSD values between the crystal and the average NMR structure of OMP derive from the different placements of a1 and loop 1 in the two structures (Figure 8). Despite the relatively large dispersion of Ca distances for a1 and loop 1 residues within the NMR ensemble, the location of these features in the crystal structure is not compatible with measured NOEs and thus, reflects a real difference. For example, although weak, long-range NOEs Q24-E43, Q24-V16 and G42-V71 are observed in the solution structure of OMP, distances between these resi° dues in the OMP crystal structure exceed 15 A. The reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, and it is possible that the two orientations represent two conformational states for OMP. We do note, however, that the a-helical projection of D18-R47, if present in solution, may not give rise to any long-range NOEs, and thus, would not be detected in our experiments. These differences in crystal versus NMR structures reflect the complementary nature of the two methodologies and contribute to a more comprehensive view of the structure of OMP than does either alone. To address these differences, work is in progress to further refine the solution structure of OMP using residual dipolar couplings76,77 as well as to assess its dynamical properties in solution using heteronuclear relaxation measurements.55,78 The interaction of OMP and Bex, coupled with the observation of an V loop encompassing the most highly conserved part of the OMP sequence, which may be a site for additional protein interactions, implies that OMP may function as an adaptor to bridge the linkage between multiple biochemical pathways. We envision that a detailed description of the OMP structure and dynamical properties as well as its interactions with Bex, is necessary for an understanding of OMP's role in modulating chemosensory transduction via protein­ protein interactions.

The recombinant rat OMP is homogeneous on SDSPAGE. The sequence of the first 18 amino acid residues of recombinant OMP (MAEDGPQKQQLDMPLVLD) is identical with that of OMP isolated from rat olfactory bulb and with the deduced amino acid sequence for the cDNA clone. Only a single sequence was observed, confirming the purity of the recombinant OMP and demonstrating the proper cleavage of the GST ­ OMP by thrombin. Additionally, the electrospray mass spectrum (ES-MS) of the recombinant protein shows only one component whose measured mass (18.6 kDa) is identical with that predicted from its primary sequence. For NMR spectroscopy, we generated purified recombinant rat OMPs uniformly labeled with the stable nuclei 15 N or 13C/15N or 2H/13C/15N. The cloning, expression and purification of recombinant rat GST ­ OMPs were as noted above, with the sole modification that the thrombin-released OMP was treated with benzamidineagarose to remove any traces of thrombin. All Escherichia coli growth media contained ampicillin (50 mg/ml) and either Bio-Express 1000 (U-15N 96 ­99%, CGM-1000-N) or Bio-Express 1000 (U-13C 97 ­ 98%, U-15N 96 ­99%, CGM-1000-CN) (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) for production of (U-15N)OMP or (U-13C,15N)OMP, respectively. To produce the triple-labeled (2H, 13C, 15N) recombinant rat OMP, the pGST-OMP7 clone was adapted to deuterium in LB medium containing increasing concentrations of 2H2O (30, 55 and 70%). Resulting stocks were stored in 15% (v/v) glycerol at 2 20 8C. The 70% 2H2Oadapted stock was used as an inoculum into BioExpress CGM-1000 CDN80 (97­ 98% 13C, 96 ­ 99% 15N, 80% 2H) (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA). Using a combination of 100% 2HO and H2O, the 10 £ medium supplied was diluted to 70% 2H2O and ampicillin was added as above. After incubation at 37 8C, OMP expression and isolation was done as for the single and double-label preparations. For use in backbone amide detected heteronuclear experiments, it is necessary to exchange all amide 2H in the triple-label sample with 1 H. For this, the sample of rat OMP was dialyzed exhaustively against 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.6. Using the triple-label medium, a sample of randomly fractionally deuterated (to the 70% level) of (U-13C,15N) rat OMP was produced. All NMR samples contained rat OMP (1.5­ 1.8 mM) in 10 mM phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM NaN3 at pH 6.6 in 95% H2O and 5% 2H2O. Bex1 peptide synthesis Two peptides from the deduced Bex1 sequence39 were synthesized, and purified by HPLC. They were Bex1 9 ­ 34 (KNLNMENDHQKKEEKEEKPQDTIRRE) and Bex1 50 ­75 (RGGRRRFRVRQPIAHYRWDLMQRVGE). Stock solutions of each contained Bex1 peptide (5.3 mM Bex1 9 ­ 34 and 19.1 mM Bex1 50 ­ 75) in 10 mM phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM NaN3 at pH 6.6 in 95% H2O and 5% 2H2O. Bex1/OMP interaction

Materials and Methods
Over-expression, purification and isotopic labeling of rat OMP Recombinant rat OMP was produced as a GST ­ OMP fusion protein13 and, after cleavage of the GST and isolation of the OMP, it was obtained in high yield (10 mg/l).

A solid-phase assay was used to confirm the interaction of Bex1 and OMP (M. Behrens and J.W.M., unpublished results).37,38 Unlabeled recombinant rat OMP was generated as described above. Unlabeled recombinant mouse Bex1 was generated as Bex1-gly fused at its C terminus to the chitin-binding domain of the intein vector pTYB2 (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA).

Both sets of statistics are reported for residues in the ordered regions of OMP.

Expressed Bex1-gly was purified to homogeneity on SDS-PAGE by column chromatography.38 The mass was confirmed by ES-MS. Chicken anti-Bex1 was generated by immunization of chickens (Aveslabs, Tigard, Oregon) with keyhole limpet hemocyanin coupled to CZSHSLRAVSTDPPHHDHHDE, where Z represents 1-aminocaproic acid, and the immunoglobulin was purified from eggs by affinity chromatography. Goat anti-OMP was as described.12 Microtiter plate wells (Immulon 2HB, U-bottom, Dynex Inc.) were coated with either recombinant OMP (0.5 mM) or Bex1 (1.3 mM) in BBS (17 mM sodium borate, 0.12 M saline, pH 8.5) for four hours and then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris ­ HCl, pH 7.4). After blocking unreacted sites with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in BBS overnight at 4 8C, the plates were washed five times with water and then each set was incubated with the reciprocal protein solution. The plates were subsequently washed five times in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 3% BSA to eliminate non-specific binding. The wells were then eluted with the protein initially bound to the plate OMP (0.5 mM) or Bex1 (1.3 mM) or with 1% SDS. The protein eluted from the plate was analyzed by Western blot using chemiluminescence for OMP (goat anti-OMP 1/8000) or Bex (chicken anti-Bex 1/5000) (J.H.K. et al., unpublished results), respectively. This procedure permits visualization of protein easily displaced by an excess of itself or that requiring stronger elution conditions indicating tight binding.

NMR spectroscopy The NMR experiments that were acquired to determine the solution structure of OMP are listed in Table 2. NMR spectra were acquired at 37 8C on a Bruker DMX600 NMR spectrometer (600.13 MHz for 1H) except for the 4D 13C, 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC, which was collected on a Bruker DRX800 spectrometer (800.13 MHz for 1H). The DMX600 spectrometer is equipped with four frequency channels, pulsed-field gradient hardware and triple-resonance probeheads (5 mm and 3 mm), each with three-axis gradients. The DRX800 spectrometer is a five channel instrument with pulsed-field gradient and deuterium decoupling hardware and a triple-resonance, triple-axis gradient 5 mm probehead. Unless noted otherwise, a one second recycle delay was used and quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was achieved using States-TPPI phase cycling.79 Initial delays in the indirect dimensions were set to half dwell time for zero-order and first-order phase corrections of 908 and 2 1808, respectively.80 Data were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using NMRPipe.81 1H chemical shifts are reported with respect to the H2O or H2HO signal at 4.658 ppm relative to external trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP) at 37 8C. The 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using the following ratios of the zero-point frequencies at 37 8C: 0.10132905 for 15N to 1H and 0.25144953 for 13C to 1H.82 For maximum sensitivity, backbone amide detection in the multi-dimensional experiments was implemented using

834
sensitivity enhancement.83 For maximum digital resolution, indirect 13C dimensions were frequency-labeled using constant-time evolution periods.84 All NMR experiments were acquired using pulsed-field gradients for water suppression85 and reduction of phase cycling.86

Structure calculations Inter-proton distance restraints derived from the NOESY experiments were classified on the basis of peak ° intensity into categories with lower bounds of 1.8 A and upper bounds of 2.7 (2.9 for HN), 3.3 (3.5 for HN), 4.2, ° 5.2 and 6.2 A as described.87 Distances for degenerate or non-stereospecifically assigned protons were represented using a (Sr 26)21/6 sum. Only non-trivial NOE restraints were included, and therefore, NOEs between geminal protons or between vicinal methylene protons were not used as restraints. Weak and very weak NOEs were used as restraints only when reciprocal NOE correlations with similar intensities were observed. Backbone dihedral angle constraints f ^ 308 and c ^ 308 for a-helix and b-strand were included based upon 3JNH ­ Ha coupling constants measured from the 3D HNHA pulse sequence88 and predictions from the TALOS program89 using the chemical shifts of the backbone atoms. ° Backbone hydrogen bond restraints rNH ­ O of 1.5 ­ 2.8 A ° and rN ­ O of 2.4­ 3.5 A were used in the final stages of structure calculation for regions of regular secondary structure. Structures were calculated with X-PLOR90 version 3.851 on a Silicon Graphics Octane/R10000 dual processor workstation using the standard protocols for substructure embedding and regularization, hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing (DGSA) and simulated annealing (SA) refinement. The SA refinement included pseudopotentials for secondary 13Ca and 13Cb chemical shifts,91 and a conformational database potential.92 Force constants used in the calculations and structural statistics are reported in Table 2. Color illustrations were produced using the MOLSCRIPT v.2.1 program (Avatar Software AB), Raster3D v.2.6c93 and Adobe Illustrator version 8.0 (Adobe Systems Incorporated).

Peptide titrations Two samples of U-15N-labeled rat OMP were titrated separately with aliquots from one of the two Bex1 peptide stock solutions. Each titration was monitored by recording 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, 4.9 and 7.4 equivalents of Bex1 peptide to OMP. Bex1 peptide was added until no further chemical shift change was observed.
