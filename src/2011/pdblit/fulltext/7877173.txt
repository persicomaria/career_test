Summarv: Highly purified Na+,K+-ATPase of the dog kidney was reacted with Mg2++32Pi or Mg2++32Pi + ouabain. 32P-phosphorylation was terminated by the addition of EDTA, and the effects of various ligands on dephosphoration rate ATP reduced the dephosphorylation rates of both the native and were studied. the ouabain-complexed enzymes. Ko.s for this effect of ATP was about 0.2 mM. ADP also slowed dephosphorylation, but less effectively than ATP. The ATP effect on the native enzyme, but not that on the ouabain-complexed enzyme, was antagonized by Nat. The data establish the binding of ATP to the phosphoenzyme. Since the site that is phosphorylated by Pi is the same that is phosphorylated by ATP, coexistence of two ATP sites on the functional unit of the enzyme is suggested.

Methods: Dog kidney enzyme was prepared and assayed as indicated before (9). Phosphorylation with 32Pi was done under conditions described in Results. 32Pi was obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA), and was purified prior to use (10). Experiments were terminated by the addition of acid (9, la), and the acid-stable phosphoenzyme was collected by filtration (21) and counted. Values for 32P-incorporation were corrected for incorporation into the denatured enzyme. The latter was less than 5% of the total as noted before (10,12). The specific activities of the preparations used here were in the range of 1000-1500 umol ATP converted to Pi.mg-l.h-l. Their maximal phosphorylation capacities were in the range of Z-3.2 nmol Pi.mg-1. Protein was determined according to Lowry -- al. (22). et No attempt was made to correct the protein values (6). Note, however, that questions concerning the state of purity of the enzyme and the absolute value of its phosphorylation capacity are not relevant to the main conclusion to be reached from the present data (i.e., that ATP binds to the phosphoenzyme). Results: It is known that the enzyme may be phosphorylated that is phosphorylated by Pi on the in the presof Fig. ATPase, presence

Effects of ATP, Na+, and K+ on dephosphorylation rates. Experiments llgll. of Fig. la were done without ouabain at 0". Those of Fig. lb were done with ouabain either at 37" (solid lines) or at 0" (dashed lines). For the formation of the phosphoenzyme, each reaction mixture (0.2 ml) contained 0.1 mg of enzyme, 0.4 mM 32Pi (added as Tris-phosphate, pH 7.2), 1 mM M C12, 1 mM ouabain (when indicated), 15 mM histidine, and 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2 7 . For each condition, phosphorylation was started 10 min. before the indicated zero time. In one series of tubes reactions were stopped by the addition of acid at zero time to obtain the initial levels of phosphoenzymes prior to the start of dephosphorylation. (For the relative values of these levels under the three experimental conditions see Fig. 3.) In the other tubes phosphorylations were terminated by the following additions at zero time, dephosphorylations were permitted to proceed for the indicated periods, and phosphoenzyme levels were determined. The additions at zero time (each in a volume of 0.1 ml) were made to obtain the following final concentrations: 20 mM EDTA (0); 20 mM EDTA + 50 mM Nat (A); 20 mM EOTA + 50 mM Kt (0); 20 mM EDTA + 1 mM ATP (0); 20 mM EDTA + 1 mM ATP + 50 mM Nat (A);.20 mM EDTA + 1 mM ATP + 50 mM Kt (m); 20 mM unlabeled Pi (X); 20 mM unlabeled Pi + 1 mM ATP (@).Tris-EDTA (pH 7.2) and Tris-phosphate (pH 7.2) were used for these additions. It was established that the pH values of the reaction mixtures did not change after the indicated additions. Each experimental point represents the mean of at least three determinations. The individual values did not differ from the mean by more than 5%.

Reaction mixtures were the same as those indicated in legend to Fig. 1 for phosphorylation in the absence of ouabain at 0" (A), and in the presence of ouabain at 0" (0) or 37" (S). Phosphorylation experiments were also attempted under the same three conditions but in reaction mixtures that contained the following additional components: 20 mM EDTA (A); 20 mM EDTA + 1 mM ATP (0); 20 mM EOTA + 1 mM ATP + 50 mM Nat (0). In these EDTA-containing mixtures no phosphoenzyme was detected under any of the three tested conditions; though only one set of data are presented.
