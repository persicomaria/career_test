The structure of the Haemophilus in¯uenzae HslU protein, a molecular chaperone of the Clp/Hsp100 family, has been Ê solved to 2.3 A by molecular replacement using a model of the homologous Escherichia coli protein. The crystals in which the structure was solved have an unusual twinning, or onedimensional disorder, in which each successive crystal-packing layer is displaced laterally relative to the one below it. A model for the twinning and an algorithm for detwinning the data are described. It is known from other work that when the HslU hexamer binds its cognate protease HslV, the carboxyterminal helices of HslU protomers distend and bind between HslV subunits. Comparison of HslU alone with its structure in the HslUV complex reveals several conserved amino-acid residues whose side-chain interactions differ between the two structures, suggesting that they may be part of a conformational switch that facilitates the release of the HslU carboxyterminal helices when HslV binds.

1. Introduction
The HslU protein (heat-shock locus U; Chuang et al., 1993) is a component of a `prokaryotic proteasome'; in association with its cognate protease, HslV, it selects and delivers polypeptides for proteolytic degradation in an ATP-dependent reaction (Missiakas et al., 1996; Rohrwild et al., 1996; Yoo et al., 1996). HslU is identi®ed at the amino-acid sequence level as a member of the Clp/Hsp100 protein family, members of which have either one (e.g. HslU, ClpX) or two (e.g. ClpA) ATPbinding domains (for a review, see Schirmer et al., 1996). The Clp/Hsp100 proteins are molecular chaperones whose spectrum of activities demonstrated by in vitro experiments include (i) presentation of various substrates to cognate proteases for degradation, e.g. the cell-division inhibitor SulA is degraded by HslUV (Seong et al., 1999), SsrA-tagged polypeptides are degraded by ClpXP and ClpAP (Gottesman et al., 1998) and RepA protein is degraded by ClpXP (Pak et al., 1999), (ii) suppression of aggregation, for example, HslU can suppress aggregation of SulA (Seong et al., 2000) and (iii) disassembly of oligomeric complexes, e.g. MuA transposase± DNA complexes by ClpX (Levchenko et al., 1995), RepA dimers by ClpA (Pak et al., 1999). Structures of E. coli HslU with protomers having either ATP or SO2À in the nucleotide-binding pocket (PDB code 4 Ê 1do0; resolution 3.0 A) as well as with AMPPNP bound (PDB Ê code 1do2; resolution 4.0 A) have been reported (Bochtler et al., 2000). They reveal the overall three-domain structure and tertiary fold of HslU: an amino-terminal ATP-binding domain of approximately 210 residues (called the `N domain'), a

carboxy-terminal domain of about 110 residues (the `C domain') and an intermediate domain (`I domain') of approximately 120 residues which protrudes from the N domain and which is generally poorly ordered in crystals. They also reveal the `hexameric ring' quaternary structure of HslU and show that HslU can `¯ex' about a hinge between the N and C domains, resulting in subtle changes of the overall conformation of the hexamer ring. A structure for E. coli HslU±AMPPNP in a complex with HslV has also been Ê reported (PDB code 1doo; resolution 2.8 A; Bochtler et al., 2000); in this complex, the overall structure of the HslU protomer shows minimal difference from its structure in HslU alone. These structures show the detailed molecular interaction of E. coli HslU with nucleoside triphosphates and one possible mode of assembly of the HslUV complex. The structure of H. in¯uenzae HslUV chaperone±protease complex, with ATP bound to HslU, has also been reported Ê (PDB code 1g3i; resolution 3.4 A; Sousa et al., 2000); comparison of the polypeptide backbone of HslU in the HslUV complex with that of uncomplexed H. in¯uenzae HslU reveals a conformational transition in which the carboxyterminal helix of HslU distends and binds between subunits of the HslV dodecamer. Here, we report the structure of the Ê H. in¯uenzae HslU±ADP complex at 2.3 A resolution and discuss the features of the structure that may relate speci®cally to the conformational transition that the molecule undergoes when it forms a complex with HslV. The crystals in which this HslU structure was solved manifest an unusual twinning or `one-dimensional disorder' phenomenon. This type of twinning arises from successive planar layers in a crystal shifting laterally into any of several alternative con®gurations when packing on top of one another; it has a propensity to occur in cases where side-toside packing interactions within layers of a crystal are strong but stacking interactions between layers are weak. The twinning is not detectable by standard tests for merohedral twinning (Yeates, 1988) and is not readily addressed with crystallographic programs that are readily available. We describe the twinning and its effect on the diffraction intensities, as well as a method for computationally `detwinning' the data. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells at 310 K. Protein was extracted from cells by French press and puri®ed by gravity-¯ow chromatography on Q-Sepharose [conditions: starting buffer, 0.2 M KCl, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol (-ME), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0 (buffer A) plus protease inhibitors; gradient, 0.230.5 M KCl; HslU protein elutes around 0.35 M KCl], followed by FPLC gel ®ltration on Superdex 200 [Pharmacia; conditions, 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM -ME, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0 (buffer B)]. Expression of seleno-l-methionine (SeMet) labeled HslU protein was carried out in the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain B834(DE3) (Novagen). Freshly transformed cells were grown at 310 K to an A600 of 0.4 in M9 medium supplemented with 10% Luria broth (LB) and 100 mg mlÀ1 ampicillin. Cells were then centrifuged, washed twice with 1.25 Â M9 medium and then resuspended and grown to an A600 of $1.0 at 310 K in M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.01 mg mlÀ1 thiamine, 0.04 mg mlÀ1 SeMet, 0.4 mM IPTG and 100 mg mlÀ1 ampicillin. SeMetlabelled HslU protein was puri®ed by the same protocol as used for wild-type protein. Comparison of native and SeMetlabelled HslU protein by mass spectrometry revealed essentially complete incorporation of SeMet. HslU protein was crystallized at 291 K using polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether of average molecular weight 2000 (PEG-MME2000) as precipitant. Native HslU protein, at a concentration of 16±20 mg mlÀ1 in buffer B plus 7 mM ADP, was crystallized in hanging drops using a precipitant solution consisting of 10% PEG-MME2000, 0.38 M LiSO4, 4 mM MgSO4, 6% MPD, 100 mM tricine pH 7.3. After crystals reached their ®nal size (approximately 0.6 Â 0.6 Â 0.1 mm in 2 d), the concentration of PEG-MME2000 in the well was increased to 16%. The diffraction properties of the crystals were sensitive to divalent and trivalent cations and were improved by the presence of sulfate. SeMet-labeled HslUV protein in buffer B plus 10 mM ADP was crystallized from a precipitant solution consisting of 10% PEG-MME2000, 0.6 M LiSO4, 6% ethanol, 10 mM MgSO4, 1 mM ZnSO4, 3 mM EuCl3 and 100 mM tricine pH 7.3. Space-group and unit-cell parameters for these crystals, as well as for two crystals soaked in heavy-atom compounds, are summarized in Table 1. For data collection, the concentration of MPD in the native HslU crystal stabilization solution was increased from 10 to 30% in 5% increments and 10±20 min intervals; the crystal was then ¯ash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at $100 K. Native diffraction data were collected on beamline 9-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) at a waveÊ length of 1.000 A. The crystal diffracted anisotropically, Ê showing measurable data to $2.0 A along the a* and b* Ê reciprocal axes, but only to $2.8 A along c*. Data were recorded on Quantum IV CCD detectors and processed with the programs HKLVIEW, DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 2. Data were also collected from a SeMet-labeled HslU crystal. In this case, cryoprotection was performed by brie¯y

2. Experimental
2.1. Protein expression, purification and crystallization

A plasmid for recombinant expression of H. in¯uenzae HslU was constructed from an expression plasmid for the HslVU operon described previously (Sousa et al., 2000) as follows. The original plasmid has an NdeI restriction site (CATATG) at the `start' codon (bold) of HslV. A second NdeI site was introduced at the HslU start codon using the Stratagene `Quik-change' mutagenesis method. The resulting plasmid was digested with NdeI and religated to yield a plasmid expressing HslU alone. Expression of native HslU protein from this plasmid was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) in

Although originally collected for de novo phasing, the selenium sites determined from these data were ultimately used to verify the HslU structure solved by molecular replacement, as described below; additionally, since the c Ê axis of the unit cell of this crystal is $22 A shorter than that of the native crystal, the SeMet-HslU model was re®ned in order to compare the HslU structures in the two crystals. Datacollection statistics are summarized in Table 2.

Rfree is computed in the same manner as Rcryst using the test set of re¯ections.

The structure of the H. in¯uenzae HslU was solved by molecular replacement with a model of the E. coli HslU protein (PDB code 1do0; Bochtler et al., 2000). The hexagonal HslU crystals are twinned (as described in detail below); however, it was possible to carry out the initial steps of molecular replacement and re®nement on raw data. Candidate molecular-replacement solutions were identi®ed with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using a single HslU protomer as a search model. Subsequent molecular re®nement was carried out with the program package CNS (Brunger et al., 1998); rigid-body re®nement of the single E. coli HslU protomer resulted in Rcryst = 0.430, Rfree = 0.469. The aminoacid sequence of the model was replaced with that of the H. in¯uenzae HslU protein. Several segments of polypeptide which could not be traced in the initial 2Fo À Fc maps (residues 85±95, 105±245 and 265±272) were deleted. Data were `detwinned' by the procedure described in x3 and several cycles of model building and re®nement were carried out. Clear density for an ADP molecule in the anti conformation became apparent in the 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps and was included in the model. Another strong peak in the maps was interpreted as a sulfate ion in an intermolecular contact region. The ®nal native HslU model includes residues 2±87, 92±120, 226±267, 270±444, 94 H2O molecules, one ADP

molecule and one sulfate ion. Final re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 2. This structure was used as a starting model for re®nement against the SeMet-HslU data, as well as for solving the structure of HslU in the HslUV complex (Sousa et al., 2000). The SeMet-HslU structure was solved using essentially the same protocol as for the native HslU structure. Final re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Native Patterson peaks suggest crystal twinning

The unit-cell parameters of our native HslU crystals are consistent with a primitive hexagonal space group. The integrated intensities merge with P6/mmm Laue symmetry and have apparent systematic absences for l = odd along the c* reciprocal axis. These data are consistent with space group P6322. The H. in¯uenzae HslU protein forms a stable hexamer in solution (it runs as an $300 kDa oligomer by gel ®ltration; data not shown); additionally, electron-microscopy studies (Kessel et al., 1996; Rohrwild et al., 1997) and, more recently, crystallographic studies (Bochtler et al., 2000) reveal a Ê hexameric ring quaternary structure with diameter $110 A for the closely related E. coli HslU protein. The native unit-cell volume could accommodate four HslU hexamers, which for P6322 symmetry would imply two protomers per asymmetric unit. However, native Patterson maps do not show peaks that would result from non-crystallographic symmetry of allowed

crystal-packing arrangements of four hexamers in space group P6322. Instead, peaks of height approximately one-sixth the origin peak are seen in the w = 0.5 plane, displaced from the sixfold axis (Fig. 1a). More precisely, if we de®ne x0 to be the magnitude of the displacement of the Patterson peaks from the sixfold axis, then peaks are observed with coordinates (u, v, w) = (x0, 0.0, 0.5) and equivalent positions generated by the sixfold rotational symmetry, i.e. (x0, x0, 0.5), (0.0, x0, 0.5), (Àx0, 0.0, 0.5), (Àx0, Àx0, 0.5), (0.0, Àx0, 0.5). It is notable that the value of x0, the magnitude of the displacement of the peaks from the sixfold axis of the Patterson, varies from one crystal to another ± we have observed values from 0.20 to 0.23. The native Patterson is consistent with the crystal packing scheme shown in Fig. 2. (i) In solution, HslU forms a stable hexameric `ring'. In the crystals, two rings pack together to form a `crystal-packing dodecamer' that has 622 point-group symmetry. (The description of the packing is more easily described and visualized as packing of dodecamers rather than hexamers, even though the dodecameric quaternary structure is a product of the crystal packing.) (ii) HslU dodecamers pack into well ordered planar layers through side-by-side interactions. The side-by-side packing is stabilized by sulfate ions, which bridge pairs of HslU protomers (Fig. 2b). The layers have hexagonal P622 symmetry. (iii) When a second layer packs on top of the ®rst, it is displaced laterally and parallel to the plane of the ®rst layer by (x0, 0), where typically x0 9 0.22 in fractional coordinates, or by translations that are equivalent by the hexagonal symmetry of the ®rst layer, i.e. (x0, x0), (0, x0), (Àx0, 0), (Àx0, Àx0) or Figure 1 (0, Àx0) (referenced to a hexagonal lattice) (Fig. 2c). w = 0.5 sections of Patterson maps for HslU crystals. In each case, extent is (±0.5, 0.5) in u and v; (0, 0, 0.5) is at the center of the section.

The crystal can be built up of macroscopic domains with long-range correlation between alternating layers, such that the third, ®fth, F F F , layers stack directly above the ®rst and the fourth, sixth, F F F , layers stack directly above the second. The translational repeat in the vertical direction is equal to the thickness of two layers, Ê $330 A in the HslU crystals. The twinning we observe would then result if macroscopic crystal domains in the crystal were rotated by multiples of 60 around the c axis relative to each other, in such a manner that each orientation was sampled equally. This can be thought of as merohedral twinning with six alternative orientations of crystal domains, differing by their rotation around the hexagonal axis.

In the HslU crystals, this packing scheme arises as a consequence of the lability of the intermolecular packing interactions between planar layers. (The molecular basis for this is described later.) The lability of these interactions is illustrated further by crystals soaked in heavy-atom compounds; in some (rare and irreproducible) cases, we observe transitions to triclinic symmetry, with unit-cell parameters closely related to those of the hexagonal form (Table 1). Native Patterson w = 0.5 sections are shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) for two examples. The section in Fig. 1(c) shows a single peak per asymmetric unit; the height is 40% (i.e. approximately half) of the origin peak which would result from a single translation vector relating one dodecamer to the other in a triclinic unit cell encompassing two dodecamers. The Patterson section in Fig. 1(d) shows six peaks of unequal magnitude, which would arise from a more complex packing scheme in which successive layers are displaced by any of several different translation vectors of unequal weight.

The model predicts systematic absences for l = odd re¯ections along the c* reciprocal axis, as can be seen by substituting h = k = 0 into (5) above; this is consistent with the systematic absences we observe in our experimental data. This analysis of the twinning is exact for a case in which there is long-range correlation of the lateral shifts of packing layers, but only approximate for the case in which the directions of successive lateral shifts are uncorrelated/random. Analysis of the latter case requires inclusion of the contributions of successive layers throughout the crystal to the structure factor, with all possible displacements of each layer weighted according to their probability in a statistical distribution of the displacements. Analysis of this type of statistical, or one-dimensional, disorder for the speci®c case of two alternative packing arrangements has been discussed by Wilson (1949) and has also been documented and analyzed for crystals of `statistically orthorhombic' imidazole-methemo-

In a simplistic analysis of the model of crystal twinning described above, we consider only nearest-layer contributions to the scattering. The experimental intensities will then have six contributions of equal weight from each of the six allowed lateral translation of the second layer relative to the ®rst.

mately 8% are rejected. Systematic comparisons show that numerically smaller upper bounds, which omit more re¯ections, give better re®nement statistics; for example, for the native data, Rfree improves from 0.287 to 0.278 when the upper bound on the detwinning factor is reduced from 50.0 to 10.0. We presume this re¯ects the fact that in this procedure many weak intensities are multiplied by large numerical factors, so that many of the large amplitudes used in the subsequent re®nement have intrinsically large errors; setting a rejection level of 50.0 versus 10.0, although it only increases the number of data used in re®nement by $1%, introduces amplitudes that are large in magnitude but low in precision. The effects of the detwinning on the re®nement statistics were compared for several crystals; the results are summarized in Table 3. When compared with raw data, re®nement against detwinned data typically improves the crystallographic R factor by 3±6%. To check whether this trend is reasonable and whether the detwinning procedure works correctly, a comparison was made with test data. (i) For each of the six alternative displacements of the second dodecamer relative to the ®rst, coordinates were generated for a pair of HslU dodecamers. (ii) Using the program SOLVE (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999), structure factors were computed from the atomic coordinates in space group P1. (iii) Intensities were computed from the structure factors, with 6% random noise incorporated into them; then, for each re¯ection, the intensities and statistical errors of the six con®gurations were averaged. (iv) The primitive hexagonal asymmetric unit was extracted from the averaged intensities; this provided our simulated `raw' data in space group P622. (v) The detwinning protocol was applied to the raw data, giving `detwinned' data. (vi) The HslU model which was used to generate the structure factors was subjected to one cycle of re®nement in CNS, including simulated-annealing, energy-minimization and restrained B-factor re®nement. The simulated raw data yielded Rcryst = 0.312 and Rfree = 0.346, while the detwinned data yielded Rcryst = 0.192 and Rfree = 0.214, an improvement of 12.0% in the crystallographic R factor (13.2% in Rfree) (Table 3).

contributions from two different sources. In the ®nal HslU model, 105 residues representing 23.6% of the scattering density could not be modeled and are absent. In addition, as discussed in x3.2, there are several indications that the crystal twinning may be more complex than the model we use to describe it and, by implication, the detwinning procedure may only partially compensate for it. One indication is the height of the peaks in the w = 0.5 plane of the native Pattersons, which range from 0.090 to 0.144 of the origin peak for the crystals summarized in Table 3; the theoretical value predicted by the twinning model is 0.167 = 1/6 of the origin peak. Further, data sets which show the greatest discrepancy from the ideal value of 0.167 for the Patterson peak also show the smallest improvement in Rfree for detwinned data compared with raw data in the re®nement. Also, the w = 0.5 sections of Patterson maps computed from detwinned data show residual peaks. Deviations from ideality in the translation relating one HslU dodecamer to another in the crystal could give rise to the behavior we observe. However, despite these disparities, the twinning model and detwinning procedure appear to account and correct for the effect of the twinning on the diffraction data to a good approximation.

extending outward from one face of the ring. The tertiary and quaternary structures of the H. in¯uenzae HslU reported here are similar to those of the E. coli protein, with which it shares 80% amino- acid sequence identity; the C backbone of the H. in¯uenzae HslU protomer superimposes on those of E. coli protomers from different crystal forms with root-mean-square Ê differences of 0.8±1.0 A. The crystal packing of the H. in¯uenzae HslU molecules can be described in terms of the molecular structure (Fig. 4). Two HslU hexameric rings pack together with the I domains extending in opposite directions from the complex (Fig. 4a), forming the `crystal-packing dodecamer' with 622 point-group symmetry discussed above. The dodecamers pack into stable planar layers through side-by-side interactions; this packing is stabilized by sulfate ions, which bridge pairs of HslU protomers (Figs. 4b and 4c). The labile interactions between layers must be mediated through the I domains, which extend from both surfaces of the planar layers; however, since the extremities of these domains are disordered in our crystals, we do not observe the interactions directly. The c axis of the H. in¯uenzae Ê SeMet-labelled crystal is 22 A shorter than that of the native HslU crystal, as a result of using different precipitants and cryoprotectants for the two crystals. Despite this difference, the C backbones of the models for the two structures superimpose with a root-mean-square difference Ê of 1.0 A. We have observed a similar contraction of the c axis when crystals are crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (Table 1). We presume that the shrinking of the c axis is a consequence of changes in structure and/or intermolecular contacts in the Figure 7 extremities of the I domains, Schematic drawing showing interactions of the carboxy-terminal helix of HslU in the HslU hexamer (left) which are disordered in our and in the HslUV complex (right). Residues from neighboring subunits of HslU are denoted with a prime; crystals such that we cannot see residues from HslV are denoted with `V' following the residue number. the speci®c changes that take place. Superposition of structures of HslU protomers from both E. coli and H. in¯uenzae in different crystal forms shows that there is minimal variation of the structure within the individual N and C domains, that there is signi®cant ¯exing about the hinge between the N and C domains and that there may be substantial conformational changes in the I domains. HslU undergoes a major conformational change when it binds HslV to form the HslUV complex; most notably, the carboxy-terminal helices of the Figure 8 Selected residues and superposition of H. in¯uenzae HslU and HslUV structures in the vicinity of the HslU protomers distend and nucleotide-binding pocket.

that in order to denature polypeptides and present them to the interior cavity of the HslV protease, HslU cycles through alternative conformations in a reaction pathway that is coupled to its ATPase cycle. The molecular mechanisms which trigger these conformational transitions are not understood; comparison of uncomplexed H. in¯uenzae HslU (with ADP bound) to its structure in the HslUV complex (with ATP bound) suggest several amino-acid residues that may contribute to conformational transitions. The interactions around both the carboxy-terminal helix and the nucleotide-binding site are well de®ned in the HslU structure; a representative simulated-annealing omit map, in which ADP and Arg394 were omitted from the model used for re®nement and phase calculation, is shown in Fig. 5. The guanidinium group of the side chain of Arg394 forms a well de®ned salt bridge with the  phosphate of ADP. Molecular interactions with the carboxy-terminal helix and ADP are shown in Fig. 6 and also schematically in Fig. 7. The side chain of Arg395 binds the terminal carboxyl group of the polypeptide. Arg394 and Arg395 are conserved across phylogeny in HslU sequences that are currently known, raising the possibility that they work in concert as a molecular switch in HslUV assembly. There are several other salt bridges and hydrogen-bond interactions stabilizing the position of the carboxy-terminal helix in the HslU structure which are less well conserved across phylogeny, including salt bridges between Arg441 and Glu389, and also between Glu435 and Arg383. Residues whose side-chain interactions differ between uncomplexed HslU and the HslUV complex are shown in Fig. 8, with their HslU conformations in brown and the conformations from the HslUV complex in green. There is a network of interactions which changes when the HslUV complex forms; most notably, Arg394 from the C domain `untethers' from the phosphates of the nucleotide bound to the N domain and Arg280 of a neighboring subunit forms a salt bridge with the catalytic Glu258 of the DEID motif in the N domain. Arguably, some of these differences might be attributable to the fact that the HslUV complex has ATP Figure 9 bound, while the uncomplexed Electrostatic surface potentials of HslV and H. in¯uenzae HslU has ADP HslU. Positions of some amino-acid residues bound. However, the equivalent are labeled in each ®gure.

ATPase activity of HslU and the peptidase activity of the HslUV complex on both short peptides and the SulA protein. Mutating the E. coli residues equivalent to Glu322 and Arg326, whose side-chain conformations are not altered by HslUV assembly, also abolishes the ATPase and peptidase activities (Song et al., 2000). No data are available on the effect of mutating Arg280. The structural data suggest that Arg280, working in concert with Arg394 and Arg395, may facilitate the release of the carboxy-terminal helix through the conformational shifts we observe which correlate with assembly of the HslUV complex. Another perturbation which may contribute to destabilizing the interactions with the carboxy-terminal helix, including the salt bridge from Arg395 to the terminal carboxyl group of the polypeptide chain, is the `¯exing' of approximately 3 between the N and C domains of HslU when the complex with HslV forms. At the same time, comparison of structures of E. coli HslU protomers with and without AMPPNP bound also reveal signi®cant ¯exing between the domains, without a concomitant release of the carboxy-terminal helix (Bochtler et al., 2000). Therefore, this perturbation may contribute to but does not by itself de®ne a molecular mechanism for the release of the carboxy-terminal helix that occurs when HslU binds HslV. Another factor which may contribute to the conformational transition in HslU is the general electrostatic interactions between the HslU hexamer and the HslV dodecamer. An image of the electrostatic surface potential of HslV, computed with the program GRASP (Nicholls & Honig, 1991), is shown in Fig. 9(a); it is particularly notable that the crevices in which the HslU carboxy termini bind have a strong positive electrostatic potential. Complementary to this, the carboxy terminus of HslU, in its distended conformation, shows a strong electronegative potential (Fig. 9b). Also, inspection of the interactions of the carboxy-terminal segment of the HslU polypeptide in the HslUV complex reveals several probable ionic interactions which are consistent with an electrostatic contribution to the binding of the distended helix to HslV in the HslUV complex (Figs. 7 and 9c). Thus, electrostatic complementarity may facilitate the structural transition that occurs when HslU binds to HslV. In summary, the high-resolution structure of the H. in¯uenzae HslU±ADP shows that Arg394 and Arg395, which are conserved across phylogeny, `link' the carboxy terminus in the C domain to ADP bound in the N domain. When the HslUV complex assembles, Arg280 links a neighboring subunit to the nucleotide through interactions with the catalytic residue Glu258, while Arg394 releases from the nucleotide. These residues may constitute a molecular `switch' which couples ATP binding and hydrolysis, or alternatively initial HslV binding, to release of the carboxy-terminal helix of HslU and formation of the HslUV complex. Other factors which may facilitate release of the helix include (i) destabilization of the interactions holding the carboxy-terminal helix in place when HslU protomers ¯ex about the hinge between the N and C domains and (ii) electrostatic interactions between HslU and HslV, as revealed by the electronegative potential of the
