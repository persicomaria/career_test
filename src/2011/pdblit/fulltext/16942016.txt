3-Fluoromethyl-7-(N-substituted aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (14, 16, and 18-22) are highly potent and selective inhibitors of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). Molecular modeling studies with 3-fluoromethyl-7-(N-alkyl aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines, such as 16, suggested that the sulfonamide -NH- could form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys57. However, SAR studies and analysis of the crystal structure of human PNMT (hPNMT) in complex with 7 indicated that the sulfonamide oxygens, and not the sulfonamide -NH-, formed favorable interactions with the enzyme. Thus, we hypothesized that replacement of the sulfonamide -NH- with a methylene group could result in compounds that would retain potency at PNMT and that would have increased lipophilicity, thus increasing the likelihood they will cross the blood brain barrier. A series of 3-fluoromethyl7-sulfonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (23-30) were synthesized and evaluated for their PNMT inhibitory potency and affinity for the R2-adrenoceptor. A comparison of these compounds with their isosteric sulfonamides (14, 16, and 18-22) showed that the sulfones were more lipophilic but less potent than their corresponding sulfonamides. Sulfone 24 (hPNMT Ki ) 1.3 µM) is the most potent compound in this series and is quite selective for PNMT versus the R2-adrenoceptor, but 24 is less potent than the corresponding sulfonamide, 16 (hPNMT Ki ) 0.13 µM). We also report the crystal structure of hPNMT in complex with sulfonamide 15, from which a potential hydrogen bond acceptor within the hPNMT active site has been identified, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39. The interaction of this residue with the sulfonamide -NH- is likely responsible for much of the enhanced inhibitory potency of the sulfonamides versus the sulfones.
Introduction Epinephrine accounts for approximately 5% of the total catecholamine content in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS),2-4 however, its role therein is not well-understood.5 Based largely on CNS localization, epinephrine neurons are thought to be involved in the regulation of blood pressure, respiration, and body temperature,6 the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland,7 the regulation of R2-adrenoceptors in the hypothalamus,8 and some of the neurodegeneration seen in Alzheimer's disease.9-11 As one approach to study the effects of epinephrine in the CNS, our laboratory has targeted phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT; EC 2.1.1.28). This enzyme catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of epinephrine (Figure 1) in which an activated methyl group is transferred from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet; 3) to the primary amine of norepinephrine (1) to form epinephrine (2) and the cofactor product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy; 4). The most thoroughly studied physiological process to which epinephrine in the CNS has been linked is the regulation of peripheral blood pressure. Administration of the PNMT inhibitor 5 (SK&F 64139,12 Table 1) to hypertensive rats resulted in a reduction in blood pressure.13 However, like many of the previously studied 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ, 6) inhibitors of PNMT, 5 was nonselective due to significant

affinity for the R2-adrenoceptor.14 Thus, some of the decrease in blood pressure may be attributed to an R2-adrenergic effect rather than to decreases in CNS epinephrine concentrations.15-17 A potent inhibitor of PNMT, which exhibits minimal affinity for the R2-adrenoceptor, would be a useful pharmacological tool for clearly defining the connection between central epinephrine concentrations and blood pressure. Compound 7 (SK&F 29661)18 is a selective PNMT inhibitor. Prior to the availability of the X-ray crystal structure of PNMT, a study on a series of THIQ-7-sulfonanalides concluded that the acidic -NH- was essential for their PNMT inhibitory activity.19 However, SAR analysis of a diverse set of compounds indicated that the acidic -NH- was not required for high PNMT inhibitory potency of THIQ-type inhibitors.20 Based on this study, a small series of 7-sulfonyl-THIQs (8-11) were prepared and evaluated.21 The inhibitory potency of 8 versus that of 7 provided further evidence that the sulfonamide -NHwas not essential for high potency at PNMT.

Active site of hPNMT cocrystallized with 7.22 A Connolly (solvent accessible) surface exposing 7 is also shown and indicates the presence of a binding pocket adjacent to the sulfonamide group of 7. A lipophilic potential is mapped on the Connolly surface, whereby the areas shown in green are neutral, blue are hydrophilic, and brown are lipophilic. Hydrogen bonds between the sulfonamide oxygens of 7 and Lys57 are shown in yellow.

The X-ray crystal structure of human PNMT (hPNMT) cocrystallized with 7 and 4 (hPNMT,7,4, Figure 2) also supported this hypothesis, because the sulfonamide -NH2- of 7 does not appear to form favorable interactions with the enzyme.22 The hPNMT,7,4 structure indicated that the increased inhibitory potency of 7 versus 6 was due to a hydrogen bond between both sulfonamide oxygens and the side chain of Lys57 (Figure 2).22 Also, one of the sulfonamide oxygens makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Arg44 and the side chain of Tyr126. The importance of the sulfonamide oxygens, and not the -NH-, was consistent with the PNMT inhibitory potency of 8 being very similar to that of 7. Prior to the availability of the X-ray crystal structure of PNMT, the addition of a fluoromethyl group (12)23 or hydroxymethyl group (13)24 to the 3-position of 7 was found to increase both potency and selectivity for PNMT. However, these compounds are not likely to penetrate the blood brain barrier

(BBB) as a result of the high polarity of the 7-aminosulfonyl substituent. According to an in vitro BBB model of THIQ-type inhibitors,25,26 there is a correlation between increased calculated log P (ClogP) values and their likelihood of BBB penetration.23 To increase the lipophilicity of 12 or 13, nonpolar substituents were added to the sulfonamide nitrogen.27 This study was successful in that some of the resulting sulfonamides, such as 14-17,27,28 were more lipophilic and virtually equipotent to their parent compounds (12 and 13). Docking studies suggested that 14-17 retained PNMT inhibitory potency because the substituents on the sulfonamide could occupy a binding pocket adjacent to the sulfonamide group of 7 (Figure 2).27,28 In addition to 14 and 16, a library consisting of a wide variety of 3-fluoromethyl7-(N-alkyl or N-aryl aminosulfonyl)-THIQs was prepared and evaluated at PNMT.27 Docking studies and SAR analysis of these compounds allowed us to probe the active site surrounding the sulfonamide group of 7 (Figure 2). From the docking results it appeared that, unlike compound 7, the sulfonamide -NHof substituted sulfonamides could be forming favorable interactions with Lys57.27 Despite this observation, on the overall basis of crystallographic molecular modeling and SAR data (particularly since sulfone 8 was less than 3-fold less-potent than sulfonamide 7), we proposed that replacement of the sulfonamide -NH- in a series of highly potent sulfonamide PNMT inhibitors (14, 16, and 18-22, Table 2) with a methylene group would result in compounds (23-30, Table 2) that would retain PNMT inhibitory potency. By substituting the polar -NHgroup with a methylene group, the resulting 7-alkylsulfonyl-3fluoromethyl-THIQs would be more lipophilic than the corresponding sulfonamides, thus increasing the likelihood they will cross the BBB. Chemistry. Sulfonyl chloride 32 was a common starting material that could be used to obtain the desired sulfones and was obtained according to previously described methods.23 Sulfonyl chloride 32 was converted to sulfones 33-39 according to a two-step procedure developed by Ballini and co-workers29 (Scheme 1). First, treatment of 32 with hydrazine formed the hydrazinosulfone, which was converted directly to sulfones 3339 with 2 equiv of the appropriate alkyl bromide or alkyl iodide and sodium acetate in EtOH at reflux. The reduction of lactams 33-39 with diborane yielded the desired 7-alkylsulfonyl-3fluoromethyl-THIQs 23-29.

THIQ 30 (Table 2) could not be prepared according to the procedure described in Scheme 1 because the sulfone intermediate could not be synthesized from sulfonyl chloride 32. An alternative route was developed and is described in Scheme 2. Sulfonyl chloride 32 was reduced to thiol 40 with tin sulfide and hydrochloric acid in acetic acid.30 Based on a procedure for synthesizing fluoroalkyl aryl ethers from phenols,31 thiol 40 was converted to its potassium salt with potassium fluoride and then reacted with 1-iodo-2,2,2-trifluoroethane in DMSO in a sealed tube at 120 °C to afford sulfide 41. The reduction of 41 with diborane followed by Boc protection of the resulting amine yielded 42. Oxidation of the sulfide group of 42 with m-CPBA yielded 43, which was deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid to afford THIQ 30. Biochemistry. In the current study, hPNMT with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed in Escherichia coli.27,32 The radiochemical assay conditions, previously reported for the bovine enzyme,33 were modified to account for the high binding affinity of some inhibitors.27,34 Inhibition constants were determined using four concentrations of phenylethanolamine as the variable substrate and three concentrations of inhibitor. R2-Adrenergic receptor binding assays were performed using cortex obtained from male Sprague Dawley rats.35 [3H]Clonidine was used as the radioligand to define the specific binding and phentolamine was used to define the nonspecific binding.

Clonidine was used as the ligand to define R2-adrenergic binding affinity to simplify the comparison with previous results.36 Results and Discussion The biochemical data for the 7-alkylsulfonyl-3-fluoromethylTHIQs 23-31 is shown in Table 2, along with previously reported data for sulfonamides 18-22, to determine the influence of the sulfonamide -NH- on PNMT inhibitory potency. Replacement of the sulfonamide -NH- with a methylene group resulted in compounds having higher ClogP values,37 making them more likely to cross the BBB. However, a comparison of the hPNMT inhibitory potencies of sulfones 23-31 with sulfonamides 7, 14, 16, and 18-22 clearly shows that the sulfonamide -NH- is playing an important role in the binding of these compounds, because all of the sulfonamides in Tables 1 and 2 are more potent than the corresponding sulfones. This result was not expected, because analysis of the crystal structure of hPNMT cocrystallized with 7 indicated that the

A lipophilic potential is mapped on the Connolly surface, whereby the areas shown in green are neutral, blue are hydrophilic, and brown are lipophilic.

sulfonamide -NH2- appears to form no favorable interactions with the enzyme (Figure 2). It was not until the acquisition of the X-ray crystal structure of hPNMT cocrystallized with 15 and 4 (hPNMT,15,4, Table 3, Figure 3) that these results could be interpreted. There are significant differences between the X-ray crystal structure of hPNMT,15,4 and the structure of hPNMT,7,4 (Figure 2). One important difference is that the structure of hPNMT,15,4 indicates the presence of a hydrogen bond between the sulfonamide -NH- of 15 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39. This interaction was not present in the crystal structure of hPNMT,7,4 (Figure 2) and was overlooked in prior docking studies with 7-N-substituted-aminosulfonyl-THIQs (using the crystal structure of hPNMT,7,4).28,38,39 The results from the analysis of this new crystal structure and our new biochemical data strongly suggest that this interaction between Asn39 and the sulfonamide -NH- is important, not only for the binding of 15, but for the binding of the other 7-N-substitutedaminosulfonyl-THIQs. Another major difference between these two crystal structures is that in hPNMT,15,4 the side chain of Lys57 is shifted away from the sulfonamide of 15 to accommodate the 4-chlorophenyl

group, and in hPNMT,7,4, the side chain of Lys57 forms hydrogen bonds with the sulfonamide oxygens of 7.22 Also, the water-mediated hydrogen bond between one of the sulfonamide oxygens of 7 and Tyr126 and Arg44 is not observed, as this water molecule is displaced by the 4-chlorophenyl substituent of 15. Neither of the sulfonamide oxygens of 15 form hydrogen bonds with Lys57, nor does either of the sulfonamide oxygens participate in a water-mediated hydrogen bond, but the sulfonamide -NH- gains a hydrogen bonding interaction, resulting in a net loss of two hydrogen bonds compared with 7 (and by extension as compared with 13, the sulfonamide group of which is predicted to bind in the same manner as 7). Because 15 and 13 are virtually equipotent at hPNMT, this net loss of two hydrogen bonds is apparently counterbalanced by additional hydrophobic interactions between the 4-chlorophenyl group of 15 and the five lipophilic residues (Tyr40, Val53, Leu58, Tyr85, and Tyr126), which are all within 3.8 Å of the 4-chlorophenyl group (Figure 3). Docking studies (AutoDock 3.0)40 were performed on sulfonamide 14 (Figure 4A) and sulfone 23 (Figure 4B) to compare the interactions of these two isosteric compounds with the active site of hPNMT. The docking results for both of these compounds indicate that they bind very much like 15. The 4-chlorophenyl groups of 23 and 14 are predicted to make the same favorable hydrophobic interactions as 15. The sulfonamide -NH- of 14 and the R-methylene group of sulfone 23 occupy the same area in the active site as the sulfonamide -NH- of 15, but only the sulfonamide -NH- of 14 is able to form a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39. We attribute most of the greater than 100-fold loss of hPNMT inhibitory potency of 23 versus 14 to the absence of this key interaction, but another factor could be contributing to this large decrease in potency. The sulfone group of 23 provides more degrees of conformational freedom than the corresponding sulfonamide group of 14 because the sulfonamide nitrogen is conjugated with the 4-chlorophenyl group and the sulfonamide sulfur. For compounds having small 7-substituents, such as sulfones 24, 26, 27, and 30 and sulfonamides 16, 19, and 20,27,38 docking

Figure 4. This figure shows a comparison of sulfonamide 14 and the corresponding isosteric sulfone 23 docked into the active site of hPNMT (modeled from the crystal structure of hPNMT in complex with 15) and some of the key residues that could interact with 14 and 23. Carbon is white, nitrogen is blue, oxygen is red, sulfur is yellow, fluorine is green, and chlorine is magenta. Hydrogens are not shown for clarity. (A) Similarly to 15 (Figure 3), the sulfonamide oxygens of 14 are unable to form favorable interactions with the enzyme because the side chain of Lys57 is shifted away to accommodate the 4-chlorophenyl group of 14. The sulfonamide -NH-, however, is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39 (2.7 Å), as is observed with 15. (B) Similarly to 14 and 15, the sulfone oxygens of 23 are unable to form favorable interactions with the enzyme because the side chain of Lys57 is shifted away to accommodate the 4-chlorobenzyl group of 23. In this case, there is no hydrogen bonding interaction with Asn39, as is observed for 15 in Figure 3 and predicted for 14. This loss of a hydrogen bond in comparison to 14 is likely to be the molecular basis for the reduced PNMT inhibitory potency of 23 versus 14.

Figure 5. This figure shows a comparison of sulfonamide 16 and the corresponding isosteric sulfone 24 docked into the active site of hPNMT (modeled from the crystal structure of hPNMT in complex with 7) and some of the key residues that could interact with 16 and 24. Carbon is white, nitrogen is blue, oxygen is red, sulfur is yellow, and fluorine is green. Hydrogens are not shown for clarity. (A) The docking results with 16 indicate that the side chain of Lys57 is able to hydrogen bond to one of the sulfonamide oxygens (3.6 Å). These docking results also predict that the water molecule, which forms key interactions in the crystal structure of hPNMT in complex with 7 (Figure 2), is apparently displaced by the trifluoroethyl group of 16. The sulfonamide nitrogen, however, is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39 (3.2 Å) and Lys57 (2.8 Å). (B) The docking results with 24 indicate that, similarly to 16, the side chain of Lys57 is able to hydrogen bond to one of the sulfone oxygens (3.3 Å). These docking results also predict that the water molecule, which forms key interactions in the crystal structure of hPNMT in complex with 7, is apparently displaced by the trifluoropropyl group of 24. Note the absence of the hydrogen bonding interactions with Asn39 and Lys57 that are observed in Figure 5A. This loss of hydrogen bonds in comparison to 16 is likely to be the molecular basis for the reduced PNMT inhibitory potency of 24 versus 16.

studies (using the crystal structure of hPNMT cocrystallized with 7) indicate that the binding of these compounds does not require movement of the side chain of Lys57 away from the sulfonamide oxygens. These studies indicate that only one of the sulfonamide oxygens of 16 (Figure 5A) or one of the sulfone oxygens of 24 (Figure 5B) is able to form a hydrogen bond with Lys57. This differs from 7 (Figure 2, where both of the sulfonamide oxygens hydrogen bond with Lys57) and 15 (Figure 3, where neither of the sulfonamide oxygens hydrogen bond with Lys57). These studies also indicate that the water molecule that is predicted to form key interactions in the structure of hPNMT,7,4 (Figure 2) is displaced by the trifluoroethyl group of 16 or the trifluoropropyl group of 24. Similarly to 14 and 15, the sulfonamide nitrogen of 16 is predicted to be within hydrogen bonding distance of the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39. Unlike 14 and 15, sulfonamide -NH- of 16 is predicted to be within hydrogen bonding distance of Lys57. Docking studies indicate that the R-methylene group of sulfone 24 occupies the same area in the active site as the sulfonamide -NH- of 16,

but only the sulfonamide -NH- of 16 is able to form hydrogen bonds with Asn39 and Lys57. This is reflected in the 10-fold loss of hPNMT inhibitory potency of 24 versus 16. Similar results were obtained in docking studies that compared sulfones 26 or 27 with sulfonamides 19 or 20 (data not shown). A curious data trend was observed for sulfones 26, 27, and 31. The ethyl sulfone (26) is less potent than the methyl sulfone (31) or the propyl sulfone (27). The same data trend is observed for the corresponding isosteric sulfonamides (7, 19, and 20).27 This data trend can be explained with docking studies using the crystal structure of hPNMT,7,4. The methyl group of sulfone 3123 is predicted to occupy the same area in the active site as the sulfonamide -NH2- of 7 (Figure 2). Thus, similarly to 7, both sulfone oxygens are able to interact with Lys57 through hydrogen bonds, and one of the sulfone oxygens is able to participate in a water-mediated hydrogen bond. Docking studies indicate that sulfones 26 (ethyl) and 27 (propyl) bind similarly to 24 (trifluoropropyl, Figure 4B). Only one of the sulfone oxygens is able to interact with hPNMT. According to docking

Sulfone Vs Sulfonamide Inhibitors of PNMT

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2006, Vol. 49, No. 18 5429

studies (data not shown), the propyl group of 27 is predicted to extend into the auxiliary binding pocket and make favorable hydrophobic interactions with Val53 and Arg44. These hydrophobic interactions apparently compensate for the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions of 27 (propyl) in comparison to 31 (methyl) because the hPNMT inhibitory potency of these compounds is quite similar. The ethyl group of sulfone 26, however, is not predicted to extend into the binding pocket, which explains its decrease in PNMT inhibitory potency versus 27 (propyl). Docking studies (not shown) and data trends indicate that similarly to 27 (propyl), sulfone 30 (trifluoroethyl) is also able to make favorable hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme. For compounds having larger 7-substituents, such as sulfones 25, 28, and 29 and sulfonamides27 18, 21, and 22, docking studies indicate that Lys57 or other residues surrounding the binding pocket adjacent to the 7-position of THIQ must move to accommodate these larger groups. The reduction in hPNMT inhibitory potency of sulfones 25, 28, and 29 versus sulfones 24, 27, 30, and 31, which have smaller 7-substituents, is likely due to their inability to form hydrogen bonds with Lys57. The cocrystallization of one of these compounds is required to determine the exact nature of their binding. That being said, the data trends indicate that the sulfonamide -NH- is required for optimal binding. We hypothesize that this is due to the ability of the sulfonamide -NH- to form a hydrogen bond with Asn39 or Lys57. In conclusion, the series of 3-fluoromethyl-7-sulfonyl-THIQs is more lipophilic but less potent than the corresponding sulfonamides. Sulfone 24 (hPNMT Ki ) 1.3 µM) is the most potent compound in this series and is quite selective for PNMT versus the R2-adrenoceptor, but 24 is less potent than the corresponding sulfonamide, 16 (hPNMT Ki ) 0.13 µM). This study has also identified a potential hydrogen bond acceptor within the hPNMT active site, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39, the importance of which is illustrated by comparing the potency of this series of sulfones to their corresponding sulfonamides. This discovery can now be applied toward the design of more potent inhibitors of PNMT. Experimental Section
All reagents and solvents were of reagent grade or were purified by standard methods before use. Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes on a Thomas-Hoover melting point apparatus calibrated with known compounds. Proton (1H NMR) and carbon (13C NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were taken on a Bruker AM-500 spectrophotometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a Ribermag R 10-10 mass spectrophotometer. Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh), supplied by Universal Adsorbents, Atlanta, Georgia. Anhydrous methanol and ethanol were used unless stated otherwise and were prepared by distillation over magnesium. Other solvents were routinely distilled prior to use. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether (Et2O) were distilled from sodiumbenzophenone ketyl. Hexanes refers to the mixture of hexane isomers (bp 40-70 °C), and brine refers to a saturated solution of NaCl. All reactions that required anhydrous conditions were performed under a positive nitrogen or argon flow, and all glassware was either oven-dried or flame-dried before use. [methyl-3H]AdoMet and [3H]clonidine were obtained from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA). Crystallography. His-tagged hPNMT was expressed, purified, and crystallized, as described previously.41 X-ray diffraction data were measured using a Rigaku FR-E copper rotating anode generator operating at 45 kV, 45 mA with Osmic Confocal MaxFlux optics (HiRes2) and an R-AXIS IV2+ imaging plate area detector. Data were processed using Crystal Clear (Rigaku Corpora-

tion, (c) 1997-2002), and phasing was carried out using CNS v1.1.42 The structure was solved by difference Fourier methods using the structure of hPNMT,7,4 (PDB 1HNN)22 as the starting model. Model building was performed using O,43 and the structure was refined using CNS v1.1.42 Topology and parameter files were generated using PRODRG 44 or XPLO2D.45 The procedure used was to refine the structure of the protein first, then add waters, followed by addition of 4 and finally 15. R-free analysis (10% of reflections) was used for cross-validation.46 A racemic mixture of 15 was used in the crystallization experiment, but the R-enantiomer accounted for the density in the active site much better than the S-enantiomer. This result was expected because previous studies on 3-substituted-THIQs indicated that the R-enantiomer is preferred over the S-enantiomer in the hPNMT active site.38,47 Coordinates and structure factors for the crystal structure of hPNMT,15,4 have been deposited as Protein Data Bank entry 2G8N. Radiochemical Assay of PNMT Inhibitors. A typical assay mixture consisted of 25 µL of 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 25 µL of 50 µM unlabeled AdoMet, 5 µL of [methyl-3H]AdoMet, containing approximately 3 × 105 dpm (specific activity approximately 15 Ci/mmol), 25 µL of substrate solution (phenylethanolamine), 25 µL of inhibitor solution, 25 µL of enzyme preparation (containing 30 ng hPNMT and 25 µg of bovine serum albumin), and sufficient water to achieve a final volume of 250 µL. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of 250 µL of 0.5 M borate buffer (pH 10.0) and was extracted with 2 mL of toluene/isoamyl alcohol (7: 3). A 1 mL portion of the organic layer was removed, transferred to a scintillation vial, and diluted with cocktail for counting. The mode of inhibition was ascertained to be competitive in all cases reported in Tables 1 and 2 by examination of the correlation coefficients (r2) for the fit routines, as calculated in the enzyme kinetics module (version 1.1) in SigmaPlot (version 7.0).32 While all Ki values reported were calculated using competitive kinetics, it should be noted that there was not always a great difference between the r2 values for the competitive model versus the noncompetitive model. All assays were run in duplicate with three inhibitor concentrations over a 5-fold range. Ki values were determined by a hyperbolic fit of the data using the single substrate-single inhibitor routine in the enzyme kinetics module (version 1.1) in SigmaPlot (version 7.0). For inhibitors with apparent IC50 values less than 0.1 µM (as determined by a preliminary screen of the compounds to be assayed), the enzyme kinetics tight binding inhibition routine was used to calculate the Ki values. R2-Adrenoceptor Radioligand Binding Assay. The radioligand receptor binding assay was performed according to the method of U'Prichard et al.35 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were decapitated, and the cortexes were dissected out and homogenized in 20 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.7 at 25 °C). Homogenates were centrifuged thrice for 10 min at 50 000 × g with resuspension of the pellet in fresh buffer between spins. The final pellet was homogenized in 200 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.7 at 25 °C). Incubation tubes containing [3H]clonidine (specific activity approximately 55 Ci/mmol, final concentration 2.0 nM) various concentrations of drugs and an aliquot of freshly resuspended tissue (800 µL) in a final volume of 1 mL were used. Tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and the incubation was terminated by rapid filtration under vacuum through GF/B glass fiber filters. The filters were rinsed with three 5-mL washes of ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.7 at 25 °C). The filters were counted in vials containing premixed scintillation cocktail. Nonspecific binding was defined as the concentration of bound ligand in the presence of 2 µM of phentolamine. All assays were run in quadruplicate with five inhibitor concentrations over a 16-fold range. IC50 values were determined by a log-probit analysis of the data, and Ki values were determined by the equation Ki ) IC50/(1 + [Clonidine]/KD), as all Hill coefficients were approximately equal to 1. Molecular Modeling. Connolly surfaces were generated in SYBYL on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation.48 Docking of the various inhibitors into the PNMT active site was performed

using AutoDock 3.0.40 The default settings for AutoDock 3.0 were used. The compound to be docked was initially overlayed with the cocrystallized ligand and minimized with the Tripos force field. The docking of inhibitors into the hPNMT active site was performed on the R-enantiomer, as a previous study on 3-substituted-THIQs indicated that the R-enantiomer is preferred over the S-enantiomer in the hPNMT active site.47 General Procedure for the Preparation of Sulfones 33-39.
