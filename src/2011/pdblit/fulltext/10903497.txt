The three-dimensional solution structure of conotoxin TVIIA, a 30-residue polypeptide from the venom of the piscivorous cone snail Conus tulipa, has been determined using 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy. TVIIA contains six cysteine residues which form a `four-loop' structural framework common to many peptides from Conus venoms including the v-, d-, k-, and mO-conotoxins. However, TVIIA does not belong to these well-characterized pharmacological classes of conotoxins, but displays high sequence identity with conotoxin GS, a muscle sodium channel blocker from Conus geographus. Structure calculations were based on 562 interproton distance restraints inferred from NOE data, together with 18 backbone and nine side-chain torsion angle restraints derived from spin-spin coupling constants. The final family of 20 structures had mean pairwise rms differences over residues Ê Ê 2±27 of 0.18 ^ 0.05 A for the backbone atoms and 1.39 ^ 0.33 A for all heavy atoms. The structure consists of a triple-stranded, antiparallel b sheet with 12x, 21 topology (residues 7±9, 16±20 and 23±27) and several b turns. The core of the molecule is formed by three disulfide bonds which form a cystine knot motif common to many toxic and inhibitory polypeptides. The global fold, molecular shape and distribution of amino-acid sidechains in TVIIA is similar to that previously reported for conotoxin GS, and comparison with other four-loop conotoxin structures provides further indication that TVIIA and GS represent a new and distinct subgroup of this structural family. The structure of TVIIA determined in this study provides the basis for determining a structureactivity relationship for these molecules and their interaction with target receptors. Keywords: cis peptide bond; 4-trans-hydroxyproline; NMR spectroscopy.

The isolation and characterization of TVIIA, a new conotoxin from the venom of the piscivorous snail Conus tulipa, was described in [1]. TVIIA consists of 30 amino-acid residues including six cysteines which are arranged in the sequence to produce a four-loop structural framework (Fig. 1). This framework is common to many conotoxins identified to date including the v-conotoxins which block calcium channels, d-conotoxins which delay the inactivation of sodium channels and k-conotoxin PVIIA which blocks potassium channels [2±4]. Despite their common structural scaffold, these toxins show a remarkably high selectivity for their various target receptors and receptor subtypes. Toxins with this framework have been identified that inhibit all the major types of voltagesensitive ion channels. TVIIA displays little sequence homology with these well-characterized pharmacological classes of peptides, but displays striking sequence homology with conotoxin GS, a sodium channel blocking peptide from C. geographus [5]. TVIIA and GS differ significantly both in primary structure and function from other members of the four-loop superfamily, and we postulate that TVIIA and GS represent a new subgroup

of this structural family [1]. Both have a short loop 2 that contains only three residues including two consecutive hydroxyprolines, whereas in other four-loop toxins this loop is typically five to six residues. In fact, this loop is short relative to all other peptides with the inhibitory cystine knot motif identified to date for which the consensus sequence is CX327CX426CX025CX124CX4213C [6,7]. Unlike other members of the four-loop superfamily TVIIA and GS both possess a C-terminal tail of six to seven residues, however, this region shows the least homology between the two peptides. The peptides are also unique in that they display no toxic effects when injected into fish or mice in contrast to other four-loop toxins from piscivorous Conus. Although the physiological target and function of TVIIA is yet to be elucidated, the high sequence identity with conotoxin GS suggests that sodium channels could be its natural target. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of TVIIA may provide a further insight into the function of this novel peptide. Determination of the three-dimensional structure will also contribute to our knowledge of the effects of changes in the loop size and amino-acid content on the four-loop conotoxin framework. Such information is potentially valuable given the recent interest in the use of this and similar scaffolds to create small proteins with novel binding activities [8±10]. In this paper, we describe the three-dimensional solution structure of conotoxin TVIIA as determined using 2D 1H NMR spectrosocopy. We have also studied an under-hydroxylated analog, [Pro10]TVIIA, which proved to be very useful for determining the peptide bond conformation of the hydroxyproline residues. A detailed comparison of the structures of TVIIA and GS provides a basis for deducing the structure-activity relationships for this subgroup of the four-loop conotoxins.

Materials TVIIA and [Pro10]TVIIA were synthesized and folded as described in [1]. D2O (99.9% and 99.99%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). NMR Spectroscopy Samples for 1H NMR measurements contained 2 mm peptide in either 99.99% D2O or 90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v) at pH 3.0. Spectra were recorded at 10 8C and 25 8C on Bruker ARX-500 and DMX-750 spectrometers. 2D NMR spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension [11]. The experiments included double quantum filtered COSY (DQF-COSY) [12], exclusive COSY (E-COSY) [13], TOCSY [14] using a MLEV-17 spin lock sequence [15] with a mixing time of 80 ms, and NOESY [16] with mixing times of 100, 250 and 350 ms. Solvent suppression was achieved using either selective low-power irradiation of the water resonance during a relaxation delay of 1.8 s, or a modified water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation (WATERGATE) sequence [17]. Slowly exchanging NH protons were detected by acquiring a series of 1D and TOCSY spectra of the fully protonated peptide immediately following dissolution in D2O. Spectra were acquired with 4096 complex data points in F2 and 400±600 increments in F1, with 16±64 scans per increment. All spectra were processed using xwinnmr (Bruker, Germany). The t1 dimension was zero-filled to 2048 real data points, and 908 phase-shifted sine bell window functions were applied in both dimensions followed by Fourier transformation and fifth order polynomial baseline correction. Chemical shifts were referenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5sulfonate (DSS). 3JHa-Hb coupling constants were measured from E-COSY spectra and 3JNH-Ha coupling constants were measured from high resolution 1D spectra and by analysis of the antiphase splitting of DQF-COSY cross peaks transformed to high digital resolution. 1 H-13C HMQC [18] spectra were recorded at 500 MHz for a 4-mm peptide sample in 99.99% D2O. Spectral widths in the 1H and 13C dimensions were 5050 Hz and 18864 Hz, respectively, and 4096 complex data points were acquired with 256 F1 increments and 48 scans per increment. 13 C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using a 13C/1H frequency ratio of 0.251449530 [19]. Structural restraints Distance restraints were derived from the 250 ms NOESY spectrum recorded at 10 8C. Cross peak volumes were

classified as strong, medium, weak or very weak, corresponding to upper bound interproton distance restraints of 2.7, 3.5, 5.0 Ê and 6.0 A, respectively. Appropriate pseudoatom corrections were applied to nonstereospecifically assigned methylene and methyl protons [20]. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were inferred from 3JNH-Ha coupling constants, with f restrained to 2120 ^ 408 for a 3JNH-Ha $ 8 Hz and to 265 ^ 258 for a 3 JNH-Ha # 5 Hz [21]. In addition, the f angle of Asp6 was restrained to 50 ^ 408 on the basis of a 3JNH-Ha coupling constant of < 7 Hz and a strong intraresidue HN-Ha NOE [22], and the f angle of Cys19 was restrained to 2100 ^ 808 as the intraresidue HN-Ha NOE was clearly weaker than the sequential Hai-1-HNi NOE from the preceding residue [23]. Stereospecific assignments for the b-methylene protons and x1 angle restraints were determined for nine residues: Cys9, Met18 (160 ^ 308); Cys13, Cys14, Leu17, Ser20, Cys24, Tyr28 (260 ^ 308); and Cys19 (180 ^ 608) by analysis of the 3 JHa-Hb values and NOE intensity patterns [24,25]. Peptide bond v angles were set to trans with the exception of Cys9-Hyp10 and Hyp10-Hyp11, which were set to the cis conformation. No hydrogen bonding restraints were included in the calculations. Structure calculations Three-dimensional structures were calculated using a simulated annealing and energy minimization protocol in the program xplor 3.1 [26]. Starting structures with randomised f and c angles and extended side chains were generated using an ab initio simulated annealing protocol [27]. The disulfide bonds were included as pseudo-NOE restraints and the simulated annealing protocol consisted of 20 ps of high-temperature molecular dynamics (1000 K) with a low weighting on the repel force constant and NOE restraints. This was followed for a further 10 ps with an increased force constant on the experimental NOE restraints. The disulfide bonds were then formally included and the dihedral force constant increased prior to cooling the system to 0 K and increasing the repel force constant over 15 ps of dynamics. Refinement of these structures was achieved using the conjugate gradient Powell algorithm with 2000 cycles of energy minimization and a refined forcefield based on the program charmm [28]. Structures were analysed using aqua and prochecknmr [29] and promotif [30], and displayed using insight ii (version 95.0.3, Molecular Simulations Inc.) and molscript [31].

A series of 2D 1H NMR spectra was recorded, assigned, and used to derive geometrical restraints which were in turn used in a simulated annealing protocol to calculate the threedimensional structure of conotoxin TVIIA. Spectra were also recorded for the under-hydroxylated analog, [Pro10]TVIIA, to help resolve potential ambiguities in the resonance assignments of adjacent hydroxyproline residues, and to probe for possible structural differences associated with the Pro subsititution. Resonance assignment Sequence-specific resonance assignment of TVIIA and [Pro10]TVIIA was achieved using well-established techniques [32], based on a combination of DQF-COSY, TOCSY and NOESY spectra recorded at 10 8C and 25 8C. For most residues, the chemical shifts of both the Ha and NH protons of TVIIA and [Pro10]TVIIA are similar, suggesting that the

Hydroxyproline residues in cis peptide bonds typically have a value of < 30 p.p.m. for Dd(Cg-Cb) whereas the value is < 33 p.p.m. for trans [33]. b The 13C chemical shifts for Pro10 also confirmed the cis peptide bond (DdCb-Cg  10.2 p.p.m.), whereas < 5 p.p.m. is expected for the trans form [50].

Hyp10 3 Pro mutation has little effect on the backbone conformation. The availability of [Pro10]TVIIA, however, was useful for resolving ambiguities in hydroxyproline assignments due to spectral overlap. For TVIIA, the Ha resonances of Hyp10 and Hyp11 are almost degenerate and this prevented the unambiguous observation of characteristic Ha-Hai11 or Ha-Hdi11 which are often useful for determining the geometry of the imide bond preceding Pro/Hyp residues. In the spectrum of [Pro10]TVIIA, however, the Ha signals of Pro10 and Hyp11 are resolved sufficiently to clearly identify the sequential Ha-Hai11 connectivity and thus to confirm the cis conformation of the Pro10±Hyp11 peptide bond. By implication, the Hyp10-Hyp11 bond in TVIIA is also cis and this is confirmed by close inspection of the aliphatic region of the NOESY spectrum which reveals a 10Ha-11Ha cross peak close to the diagonal. The Cys9-Hyp10 peptide bond conformation is also cis, as inferred from the presence of a strong Ha-Hai11 cross peak. The conclusion that both the Cys9-Hyp10 and Hyp10-Hyp11 peptide bonds in TVIIA are cis is supported by the 13C chemical shifts for Hyp10 and Hyp11 (Table 1). In particular, the chemical shift dispersion of the Cb and Cg resonances (DdCg-Cb) provides a valuable marker for X-Hyp geometry [33]. The values of DdCg-Cb for Hyp10 and Hyp11 are 30.6 and 28.4 p.p.m., respectively, which contrast with an expected chemical shift dispersion of < 33 p.p.m. for the trans form. The 1H chemical shift assignments for TVIIA and [Pro10]TVIIA are provided as supporting information. The Ha shift data were used to calculate the chemical shift index for each residue [34] and were used in an analysis of the secondary structure of TVIIA (Fig. 2). Secondary structure A qualitative analysis of the sequential and medium range NOEs, 3JNH-Ha coupling constants, amide NH exchange rates and Ha chemical shift indices was used to characterize the secondary structure of TVIIA. These data are summarized in Fig. 2 and indicate antiparallel b strands comprising residues 7±9, 17±20 and 23±26. The experimental parameters which are consistent with this determination include: strong Ha-NHi11 connectivities, weak NH-NHi11 connectivities, and a number of interstrand NOEs; slow amide exchange rates; and 3JNH-Ha coupling constants greater than 8 Hz. However, the 3JNH-Ha coupling constants for Arg8, Cys24 and Ser26 are smaller than expected for canonical f angles found in b sheets, suggesting

distortions from idealized structure for these residues. The presence of several medium range Ha-NHi12 and NH-NHi12 NOEs suggests that the structure also incorporates several turns. Disulfide bond determination The disulfide connectivities of TVIIA were established from an analysis of both local and global NOE data [35]. First, the presence of several Ha±Hb (residues 14±2, 19±9, 24±13 and 13±24) and Hb±Hb (residues 2±14, 9±19, 13±24) NOEs between cysteine residues suggested disulfide bonds between 2 and 14, 9±19 and 13±24. No NOEs were detected between any other pair of Cys residues. Second, a family of structures was calculated without the inclusion of disulfide bonding information and the S±S distances in these structures were examined to determine which of the 15 possible bonding patterns was the

most probable [36,37]. The pairing 2±14, 9±19, 13±24 produced the lowest rmsd from the ideal S±S distance averaged over all disulfide bridges in all structures. In addition, the I-IV, II-V, III-VI pattern of disulfide bonds deduced from the NMR data is identical with that determined so far for other conotoxins with the six cysteine/four-loop framework. Structure determination Three-dimensional structures were calculated only for TVIIA, as no qualitative difference in the the pattern of NOEs, coupling constants and slowly exchanging amide protons for TVIIA and [Pro10]TVIIA was detected, suggesting their structures are

similar. A set of 50 structures was calculated using a simulated annealing protocol which incorporated 562 interproton distance restraints derived from 182 intraresidual, 127 sequential, 100 medium range (|i±j| # 5) and 153 long range NOEs. These restraints were supplemented with 18 backbone and nine sidechain dihedral angle restraints derived from spin-spin coupling constants. The 20 structures with the lowest energies and fewest residual restraint violations were chosen to represent the solution structure of TVIIA (Fig. 3). A summary of the geometric and energetic statistics of the final structures given in Table 2 shows that the structures are consistent with the experimental restraints, exhibit only small deviations from idealized geometry and have good nonbonded contacts. Analysis of the family of 20 structures using prochecknmr [29] reveals that 67.5% of residues lie in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot with the remaining 32.5% in the additionally allowed regions. The relatively low distribution of residues into the most favoured region is similar to that seen in other small disulfide rich peptides, particularly conotoxins [33], probably reflecting the more strained nature of these molecules compared with larger proteins. Nevertheless, , 0.1% of residues are in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The backbone conformation of TVIIA is well determined with a mean pairwise rms deviation for the backbone heavy Ê atoms (C, Ca, N) of 0.74 ^ 0.41 A. However, some regions of the structure are more precisely defined than others (Fig. 3). In particular, the N- and C-termini are the least ordered and display higher atomic rms deviations and lower angular order parameters. By contrast the core region is exceptionally well defined and the backbone pairwise rmsd calculated for residues Ê 2±27 is only 0.18 ^ 0.05 A. Description of the structure The three-dimensional structure of TVIIA consists of a triplestranded antiparallel b sheet with 12x, 21 topology comprising residues 7±9, 17±20 and 23±26, linked in a network which is principally stabilized by three disulfide bonds (Fig. 3). A similar structural feature has been identified in a number of other toxic and inhibitory polypeptides and has been termed the inhibitor cystine knot motif [7]. In addition, a b bridge involving residues Ser3 and Cys13 is also present in

TVIIA with hydrogen bonds between Ser3NH-Val12CO and Cys14NH-Ser3CO. These hydrogen bonds are present in all of the calculated structures and are supported by the slow exchange of the Ser3 and Cys14 amide protons. Eight b turns are present in the loops and C-terminus of TVIIA. Residues 4±7 (loop 1) and 14±17 (loop 3) both form type II turns. Loop 2, which is conformationally restricted by its small size and the presence of two hydroxyproline residues, is composed of two consecutive turns (types VIa and I) involving residues 9±12 and 10±13. The strands in the b hairpin are connected by a distorted type II, I H double turn involving residues 19±22 and 20±23 (loop 4). Finally, residues 26±29 and 27±30 in the C-terminus form overlapping type I turns, however, no intramolecular hydrogen bonds are present, most likely due to the exposed nature of these residues. This is supported by the rapid exchange of backbone amide protons in this region with D2O and Ha chemical shifts close to random coil values, despite the fact that the NOE data are clearly indicative of turns (Fig. 2). Notably, the three double turns observed in TVIIA are those most commonly found in protein structures, with the distorted II, I H (or bEgg) double turn being particularly favoured in small b hairpins [38]. The elements of secondary structure identified in the calculated three-dimensional structures account for many of the observed slowly exchanging backbone amide protons. The network of hydrogen bonds between b strands which was identified earlier by a qualitative analysis of the slow exchange data (Fig. 2) is confirmed by the three-dimensional structure calculations, with the exception of Cys9NH and Lys23NH which lack clearly defined hydrogen bonding partners. However, inspection of the structures shows that Cys9 is substantially shielded from the solvent and this accounts for the slow exchange of its amide proton.

The geometries of the three disulfide bonds involving cysteine residues 2±14, 9±19 and 13±27 are well defined (Fig. 3) and adopt right-handed hook, right-handed spiral and left-handed spiral conformations [39], respectively. The three disulfide bonds form a knot in which the 13±27 disulfide bond passes through a ring formed by the other two disulfides and their connecting polypeptide backbones. Disulfides 9±19 and 13±27 are substantially shielded from the solvent and contribute to a small hydrophobic core which also includes Leu17. The NMR restraints and coordinates of the 20 final structures have been deposited at the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1EYO.

DISCUSSION
The family of conotoxins defined by the six cysteine/four-loop structural framework encompasses a wide range of pharmacological activities including the v-conotoxins which block calcium channels, d-conotoxins which delay the inactivation of sodium channels, k-conotoxin PVIIA whick blocks potassium channels, and mO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB which affect both sodium and calcium currents [2±4]. Despite their common structural scaffolds, these toxins typically show a remarkably high selectivity for their different target receptors and receptor subtypes. Thus, these toxins are valuable pharmacological probes of ion channels and potentially provide useful leads for the development of ion channel therapeutics with high affinity and specificity. In the preceding paper [1], we demonstrated that while TVIIA belongs to the `four-loop' structural family, it does not belong to any of the previously described pharmacological classes and together with conotoxin GS represents a new and

distinct subgroup of the four-loop structural family. In this study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of TVIIA in aqueous solution using 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. The core structure is a triplestranded, antiparallel b sheet with 12x, 21 topology (residues 7±9, 16±20 and 23±27) and includes several b turns. TVIIA also contains three disulfide bonds which form a cystine knot, and a number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a compact and exceptionally well-defined structure. The global fold of TVIIA is very similar to other fourloop toxins whose structures have been determined to date, including several v-conotoxins [40±43], conotoxin GS [44] and k-conotoxin PVIIA [45,46]. Despite low sequence identity among these toxins other than for the conserved cysteine residues, their three-dimensional structures show a similar location and orientation of surface loops and secondary structure elements. Some differences between the structures arise from the size and amino-acid content of the loops and are manifest in the length of the b strands and the types of b turns. The conserved structural framework is of course important in orienting the surface exposed loops but it is the amino-acid composition of these loops that is critical in defining interactions with target ion channels. These points are illustrated in Fig. 4 by a comparison of the backbone folds and surfaces of TVIIA and three representative examples of other four-loop conotoxins, including blockers of sodium (conotoxin GS), calcium (v-conotoxin MVIIA) and potassium (k-conotoxin PVIIA) channels. The ribbon structures highlighting the backbone folds of the different peptides in Fig. 4A show a marked similarity, but the surface distribution of amino acids types in Fig. 4B is quite varied amongst the different peptides. With respect to their surfaces, the only common feature amongst the different peptides is a patch of two or more positively charged residues on the front face of the molecule as displayed in Fig. 4B. This space-filling representation also highlights the similar shapes of

TVIIA and GS and the different shapes of the calcium channel (MVIIA) and potassium channel (PVIIA) blocking peptides. Also striking in Fig. 4B is a significantly higher degree of surface exposure of one of the disulfide bonds (Cys2±Cys14, linking the N-terminus to the centre of the peptides) in the latter two peptides compared with TVIIA and GS. This is a consequence of an additional residue at the N-terminus of these peptides which is outside the cysteine framework. The four loops of TVIIA, GS, MVIIA and PVIIA are colour coded in Fig. 4A to highlight their orientations. The v-conotoxins, which are the most studied of the four-loop peptides, are represented in Fig. 4A by MVIIA. Loops 1 and 3 (both colour coded pink) are thought to be the least important for activity based on mutagenesis studies, with the exception of Lys2 [47,48]. Figure 4A shows that the three-dimensional arrangement of these two loops is highly conserved. By contrast, loop 2 (green) and loop 4 (white), thought to be most important in receptor binding, are more variable in their size and orientation. Interestingly, residues in loops 2 and 4 have also been postulated to be involved in the binding of k-conotoxin PVIIA to the Shaker potassium channel [45]. The smaller size of loop 2 in the GS/ TVIIA subfamily relative to the other peptides is readily apparent in Fig. 4A. The threedimensional structures thus support the notion of these peptides being distinct from other four-loop conotoxins. Another striking feature of Fig. 4A is the larger size and hence greater exposure of loop 4 in GS relative to all of the other peptides. This is further discussed below. As the greatest similarity amongst the four-loop conotoxins occurs between TVIIA and GS, a more detailed structural comparison of these two peptides was undertaken. This provides information regarding sequence effects on conformation and possible common modes of interaction with target receptors.

Comparison of TVIIA with conotoxin GS The high sequence homology of these two peptides suggests the possibility of a similar biological activity. Conotoxin GS binds to voltage-dependent sodium channels at the tetrodotoxin/ saxitoxin/m-conotoxin binding site (site I) causing a block in sodium ion conduction [5], while the activity of TVIIA is yet to be elucidated. It is of interest to note that GS is much less potent than the well-known sodium channel inhibitors, the m-conotoxins [49], and in addition to discriminating between muscle and neuronal subtypes of the sodium channel, GS appears to be able to discriminate between skeletal muscle and eel electroplax. The binding affinity of GS for eel electroplax membranes, rat skeletal muscle homogenates and the rat brain P2 fraction is 58 nm, 880 nm and . 10 mm, respectively [5]. Given the similarity in structure of TVIIA and GS, it would be of interest to conduct similar binding studies for TVIIA and to further investigate the effects of these toxins on sodium channels. However, it is possible that these peptides may target an as yet unidentified receptor. TVIIA is three residues shorter in loop 4 than GS and differs in amino-acid sequence at 11 postions with the majority of substitutions in the C-terminal tail of the molecule (Fig. 1). This `tail' is an unusual feature of these two peptides, as most six cysteine/four-loop conotoxins contain few residues outside the cysteine framework. The significance of the tail is not yet known, but it appears not to have an influence on the structure of the core region of the molecules. Removal of the tail in GS has no effect on backbone chemical shifts of the core region,

Fig. 6. (a) Secondary Ha chemical shifts, i.e. differences between observed chemical shifts and random coil shifts for the Ha resonances of conotoxins TVIIA and GS, and (B) difference in the Ha and NH shifts between the two peptides. The random coil values used were from [51], and the Gly Ha resonances have been averaged as suggested for the analysis of chemical shift index [34]. The sequences of TVIIA and GS were aligned as shown in Fig. 1, and positions where amino-acid substitutions occur are indicated by an asterisk (*). Please note that GS has an additional three residues in loop 4, however, these are not shown for clarity.

suggesting there is no conformational change (J. M. Hill, unpublished results). As anticipated based on the high sequence identity and as indicated in Fig. 4A, the overall fold of TVIIA and GS within the core region is essentially the same, with the backbone heavy atoms (C, Ca, N) of residues 2±9, 12±20 and 23±27 of TVIIA and residues 2±9, 12±20 and 26±30 of GS superimposing with Ê a rms deviation of 0.95 A. There are, however, some interesting differences in local conformation between the two peptides, particularly in loops 2 and 4. These differences are readily apparent in the backbone superposition in Fig. 5. Despite the identical size of loop 2 in both peptides there is a markedly different orientation of this loop with respect to the rest of the structure in TVIIA compared with GS. By contrast, the differences apparent in Fig. 5 for loop 4 reflect different loop sizes rather than different orientaions. Truncation of this loop in TVIIA results in a smaller projection of loop 4 from the molecular core, although the relative orientation of this loop in the two peptides is similar. Additional insight into these and other subtle structural differences between the two peptides was obtained from an examination of chemical shift data, which provides complementary information to the NOE-derived structural data. Chemical shifts are extremely sensitive to the local electronic environment and are valuable for highlighting local structural differences. The backbone chemical shifts of TVIIA and GS are compared both to each other and to those in random coil peptides in Fig. 6. These data are discussed in conjunction with structural data for each of the loops in TVIIA below. Loop 1. The structures in Fig. 5 show that there is a very high degree of structural superposition in this region, despite the replacement of glycine by aspartic acid at postion six. In most four-loop conotoxins there is a conserved glycine residue at this position, and it is thought to play a structural role by participating in a type II b turn as observed in the NMR structures of several v-conotoxins [40±43] and GS [44]. However, other small residues such as Asp, Asn and Ser are

readily able to adopt a positve f angle to fulfill this role [22]. This is illustrated by the three-dimensional structures of TVIIA determined in this study and k-conotoxin PVIIA [45,46] which easily accomodate an Asp or Asn residue at this position, respectively. The chemical shift data however, suggest the possibility of an important electronic difference. The Ha resonance of Asp6 experiences an upfield shift from random coil (0.53 p.p.m.), and the NH resonance is further downfield than that of Gly6 in GS. This is consistent with stronger hydrogen bonding in TVIIA. This proposal is supported by the structure calculations as the 6NH-24CO hydrogen bond is present in all 20 TVIIA structures, whereas the corresponding 6HN-27CO hydrogen bond in GS is formed in only five of the 20 calculated structures [44]. Loop 2. As noted above it is clear that there are differences in the orientation of loop 2 relative to the rest of the molecule. Examination of the structures show this is a consequence of changes in the backbone dihedral angles at residues 10 and 11 (Fig. 5). This region in the structure of TVIIA adopts a VIa, I double turn (residues 9±12 and 10±13), whereas in GS residues 9±12 form a nonstandard bpbp turn [44]. However, the differences may not be as marked as implied by the calculated structures, as a larger number of medium-range NOEs were obtained for this region in TVIIA whereas overlapping resonances in GS restricted the number of available distance restraints. A more complete restraint set for TVIIA was aided by the availability of the Hyp10 3 Pro mutant to help resolve ambiguities in hydroxyproline assignments and the increased sensitivity and resolution of the 750 MHz spectrometer. It is also of interest to note the different conformation of the 9±19 disulfide bond in the two structures (Fig. 5). In TVIIA, the 9±19 disulfide bond adopts a well-defined right-handed spiral conformation. By contrast, in GS this disulfide bond populates two conformations, with 16 structures displaying a left-handed conformation and four structures a right-handed spiral [44]. This difference also appears to reflect the larger number of long-range NOEs observed between Cys9 and Cys19

for TVIIA and is supported by high resolution structures of other toxins with a similar structural scaffold in which the corresponding disulfide bond is a right-handed spiral (J. M. Hill, unpublished results). Loop 3. The substitution of Met18 for Arg has little effect on the conformation of loop 3 as shown by the superimposition of TVIIA and GS and the similar chemical shifts for residues 15±18 (Figs 5 and 6). Loop 4. Differences in the Ha and NH chemical shifts of Arg21 reflect changes in the size and conformation of loop 4 and the Gly 3 Ser substitution at position 20. Ha of Arg21 in TVIIA is 0.53 p.p.m. upfield from random coil, while in GS it is closer to random coil (0.07 p.p.m. downfield). Arg21 NH experiences an extremely large downfield chemical shift. The amide proton of Ser20 in TVIIA experiences a greater downfield shift than that for Gly20 in GS, and is found to be in slowed exchange with the solvent. In TVIIA, Ser20HN forms a hydrogen bond with Lys23CO in the b sheet. The differences in chemical shift and exchange rates are consistent with stronger hydrogen bonding. In summary, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a newly discovered four-loop conotoxin from C. tulipa and shown that it is most similar to conotoxin GS, a sodium-channel blocking peptide from another piscivorous species, C. geographus. The structural data suggest that TVIIA and GS may target the same receptor. However, to establish a structure-function relationship, a detailed functional characterization of TVIIA is required. Identification of the target receptors and the systematic alteration of the side chains of the toxin surface will enable the structural basis of its activity to be revealed, however, it seems likely that TVIIA and GS form part of a new subgroup within the four-loop superfamily.
