Dedicated to Prof. Helmut Vorbrüggen on the occasion of his 75th birthday The natural product indirubin (1) is part of the class of indigo dyes, employed by mankind since the Bronze Age for textile coloring.[1] These indigo dyes were traditionally obtained by processing of precursor compounds occurring in a number of plants and marine animals and consisted mainly of indigo (5; blue) with a small percentage of indirubin (1; purple). In the course of an intensive effort to prepare synthetic indigo as a further program for the rapidly expanding dye industries, the first total synthesis of indirubin (1) was achieved in 1870 by Adolf von Bayer.[2] Shortly thereafter, the total synthesis of indigo was achieved, and synthetic indigo became a major product of the dye industries. Eventually, this dye chemistry laid the foundation for the first synthetic drugs including arsphenamine, acetaminophen, and acetyl salicylic acid. More than 100 years later in 1979, indirubin was reported in a seminal publication to be the active constituent of a traditional Chinese antileukemia remedy.[3] This finding prompted further investigations into the pharmacological properties of the indirubins[4, 5, 6] and resulted in a 1999 report by Eisenbrand, Johnson, Mejier, and co-workers, who showed that indirubin and close analogues are ATP-competitive inhibitors of the enzyme CDK2 (1: IC50 = 2 mm; see Table 1), a key target in the ongoing search for novel antitumor therapies.[7, 8] This discovery places indirubin in the larger class of ATP-competitive CDK inhibitors of the oxindole family, such as 2, 3, and 4 (Scheme 1).[8, 9] In this publication, the X-ray structure of the related indirubin-5-sulfonic acid (20; IC50 =

0.5 mm; see Table 1) bound to CDK2 gave the first insight into the binding mode of these novel inhibitor structures incorporating the oxindole motif.[7] Taken together, the indirubins were discovered to be a new lead series in the search for therapeutically relevant CDK2 inhibitors. The drawbacks of these early indirubins were those already known: very low aqueous solubility, causing poor absorption and low cellular activity (see Table 1).[5, 7] Thus, a group from Schering AG, Berlin and the Eisenbrand group set out in a joint effort to prepare indirubin derivatives that could overcome these issues and deliver novel compounds with high CDK2 potency (IC50 < 0.1 mm), good water solubility (Sw > 40 mg LÀ1), and high activity in suppressing the in vitro growth of the MCF7 cancer cell line (MCF7 < 1 mm; the desired profile is listed in Table 1) as the prerequisite for further in vivo evaluation. In addition, a colorless compound was preferred. This communication highlights the findings of our recent work toward indirubin derivatives with the desired properties. Only a small number of indirubins are commercially available. Our first entry into this class was thus to follow a wellChemBioChem 2005, 6, 531 ­540 www.chembiochem.org

known modular approach towards indirubins by the condensation of an indoxyl equivalent, such as 6, and an isatin, such as 7 (Table 2). Commonly employed indoxyl derivatives of the indoxyl O-acetate (e.g., 6), indoxyl N,O-diacetate (e.g., 9), and indoxyl N-acetate (e.g., 15) type provided good yields on basic and/or on acidic coupling with different isatins (see Table 2, entries 1, 2, and 5). To obtain access to more indoxyl derivatives via the large class of commercially available indoles, we first employed a method that allowed for the oxidation of indole N-benzenesulfonates (e.g., 16) into the corresponding indoxyl N-benzenesulfonates (e.g., 12; see Scheme 2).[10] Attempts to employ these indoxyl N-benzenesulfonates in couplings with isatins to yield the corresponding indirubins were successful under basic conditions, but with low yields (Table 2, entry 4). Under acidic conditions such attempts failed (decomposition of the indoxyl species on extended reaction times), since the acidic cleavage of N-benzenesulfonates occurs only under harsh conditions and this cleavage is required for the condensation reaction. We therefore modified the protocol and employed a variety of indole N-acetates--such as 17 and 18--as starting materials.

Only positions 5, 3', 4', and 5' appeared to be readily amenable for substitutions (see Figure 1 c), while substituents in positions 1, 6, 7, 6', and 7' lead to loss of activity (data not shown).

on testing in in vitro (and in vivo) systems; the compounds precipitate when added to aqueous biological systems, for example, or stick to certain compartments of the cell. To overcome this low solubility, two strategies were examined, based on the empirical Equation (1), that puts the solutbility pf an organic compound in water (log S) in relation to its affinity to water (log D) and the affinity of the compound to itself (mm.p.):[12] log S ¼ Àlog DÀ0:01 m:p: ð1Þ

Series B: Polar substituents on 5-sulfonamides The first strategy was to increase the affinity to water (decrease log D) by introducing polar groups--either into the core structure or attached to it. However, this strategy has limitations, as very polar molecules (log D < À1) will no longer passively penetrate physiological lipid bilayers.[13] Since lead compound 8 had a c log D (calculated log D) of 2.3, there was scope left for increasing polarity. In pursuit of this strategy, inspection of the available X-ray data in combination with modeling studies identified the 5-position (pointing towards the polar triphosphate channel), the 3'-position (pointing towards the ribose pocket), and the 5'-position (pointing towards the aqueous surroundings at the end of the pocket) as promising positions to attach polar functionality (see Figure 1 b). We expected that these polar side chains would increase not only aqueous solubility but also the affinity to the ATP binding pocket through interaction with the corresponding polar pockets (triphosphate channel, ribose pocket). First, 1 was converted via the corresponding 5-indirubinsulfonic acid 20 into the sulfonyl chloride species 21, which was then treated with large number of nucleophiles, mostly amines, by parallel synthesis techniques (see Scheme 3). While amino alcohol side chains did not substantially increase the solubilities of these compounds (Sw < 1 mg LÀ1 in all cases; example 33 in Table 1), polar amino acid side chains (e.g., 34) and amino polyols (e.g., 35) diminished CDK2 potency below our IC50 threshold of 0.1 mm. Finally, utilization of basic diamine side chains gave access to new indirubin derivatives such as 22, with good CDK2 potency (0.01 mm), markedly increased solubility (12 mg LÀ1), and excellent cellular activity

(< 0.1 mm). The basic sulfonamide 22 was then coupled in the 3'-position with further solubility-increasing elements, namely oxime ethers, firstly by treatment with hydroxylamine to yield 23 and subsequently by treatment under basic conditions with various nucleophiles such as the sugar building block 24. While the simple oxime derivative 23 displayed a slight increase in solubility (18 mg LÀ1 compared to the 12 mg LÀ1 of the 3'-keto species 22) and retained its activity, all corresponding oxime ethers (e.g., 25) displayed unacceptable decreases in CDK2 activity. All other attempts to substantially increase the solubility of the lead compound 8, variously through the 3'-position (other oxime ether derivatives) or through the 4'- and 5'-positions, while maintaining CDK potency were unsuccessful (data not shown).

Series C: Deplanarization--quaternary center at the 3'-position The second strategy was to decrease planarity. Because of the inherent "textile-dye nature" of the indirubins--being completely flat and rigid--these molecules form adhesive crystal packings; this is reflected by the high melting points (> 300 8C) of these compounds, which are rather modest in size and polarity.[14] The probability was therefore high that disturbing the flatness of these molecules should reduce their propensity for tight crystal packing, thus decreasing their melting point and resulting in increased water solubility. Inspection of the X-ray data and corresponding modeling studies revealed the 3'-position as a potential handle through which to "break" the planarity of the indirubins without risking loss of CDK2 potency in the rather flat binding pocket (see Figure 2). In a first study, a suspension of 5-bromoindirubin (14) in THF was treated with an excess of methylmagnesium bromide at room temperature (see Scheme 4). Nucleophilic attack took place at the more active 3'-carbonyl group to provide the corresponding tertiary alcohol 26. Although starting material 14 and product 26 are similar in c log D, they differ strongly in m.p. (> 300 8C for 14 but 231 8C for 26) and, nicely following the empirical Equation (1), the "quaternary indirubin" 26 showed--in contrast to 14--a measurable (!) water solubility of 9 mg LÀ1 (see Table 1).

Figure 2. a) Side view of 5-bromoindirubin 14 illustrating the relatively flat cleft of the ATP binding pocket of CDK2. b) The scaffold of the quaternary indirubin 37 is in almost the same position as the 5-bromoindirubin 14 and forms the same hydrogen-bond pattern to the hinge region of CDK2. In addition, the hydroxy oxygen atom in the 3' position forms a weak hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Ile10, whereas the methyl group is in the hydrophobic environment of the Leu134 side chain. This interaction pattern suggests that even though the racemate was soaked into the CDK2 crystal, only the S form of the quaternary compound has bound. Furthermore, both oxygens of the sulfonamide group are close to the main-chain amide of Asp145 and the side-chain nitrogen of Lys33.

tencies of these products with 3'-quaternary centers were generally lower than those of the corresponding 3'-keto compounds by factors of 2 to 10, but in many cases still met our threshold of < 0.1 mm (27 a: 0.07 mm, 29 a: 0.09 mm). In all cases the (+) enantiomer was more active than the (À) enantiomer by a factor of 10 to 50 (vide infra). The solubility was in or above our standard measurement range (27 a > 40 mg LÀ1) and the inhibition of tumor cell growth met our criteria (29 a: 0.7 mm). As expected, increased bulk in the near vicinity of the 3'-position lead to decreased binding, since there is only limited space in the binding pocket (data not shown). In an attempt to mimic the ribose pocket of ATP, additional hydroxy groups were introduced into the allyl side chain Scheme 4.

Series D: Combination of 3'-quaternary center and polar 5-sulfonamides Finally, the combination of increasing polarity in the side chain and decreasing planarity in the core structure propelled the water solubility to values above our standard upper measuring limit of 40 mg LÀ1; for example, 28 a and 30 a (see Scheme 4 and Table 1). In addition, their water solubilities were determined by a thermodynamic method (flask method), good water solubility being found for both 28 a (710 mg LÀ1) and 30 a (418 mg LÀ1)--with the expected trend of a higher solubility for 28 a than for 30 a. These compounds proved to be high in CDK2 potency (30 a: 0.04 mm) and showed strong anitproliferative activity against the MCF7 cell line (30 a: < 0.1 mm). As observed before, the (+) enantiomers were always of higher activity than their (À) counterparts.

Selectivity of the new indirubin derivatives against other targets Meijer and co-workers reported a number of indirubins to be low nanomolar inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3b (gsk3).[16, 17] Gsk3 may be involved in a number of diseases, including diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, infectious diseases, and, last but not least, cancer. However, it currently seems that it indeed has multiple roles and thus we were not interested in a gsk3 component of our anticancer CDK2-inhibitors. While the early compounds 14, 20, and 32 (see Table 3) show significant to strong gsk3 inhibition--in line

specific CYP enzymes, which then "toxify" the initially nontoxic AhR activator, for example, by epoxidation.[22] In addition, the past decade has brought evidence that the AhR is an active participant in the control of cell homeostasis. In line with these observations, two structure classes acting as AhR agonists have shown potent antitumor activity against breast and mammary tumors in animal studies, while showing low toxicity.[22, 23] For indirubins it has been reported that simple, low-substituted derivatives are potent AhR activators. The cytotoxic effects of indirubins appear to be mediated by CDK2 in an AhR-independent manner. However, several 1-methylindirubins, devoid of any CDK2 (and gsk3) activity, showed strong cytostatic effects.[21] Thus the AhR-binding properties of indirubins may well contribute to their reported in vivo effects on leukemia. We currently do not possess data on the AhR properties of our advanced indirubin derivatives such as 30 a/b, and further investigations should add valuable pieces to the "AhR puzzle". Finally, indirubin (1) has been reported to be a nonselective inhibitor of targets other than kinases (b-lactamase, chymotrypsin, malate dehydrogenase) at higher micromolar levels (> 20 mm).[24] This effect is exerted by a nonspecific aggregate formation of indirubin (and also of a number of other nonspecific inhibitors). The mechanism for this aggregate formation is currently unknown, thus we can not exclude the possibility that our advanced indirubin derivatives, such as 30 a/b, may also possess this property and exert it at concentrations well above the 10 mm tested in our assays. However, we can state that the observed low nanomolar CDK2 inhibition of 30 a/b is due to the specific binding at the ATP side, as indicated by the several X-rays of related indirubins in this and other publications, and that the submicromolar concentrations needed for inhibition of cancer cell growth in vitro (< 0.1 mm) would make the necessity for a 100-fold higher in vivo concentration unlikely.[25] Strongly supported by X-ray data and modeling studies, we have succeeded in deriving from the initial lead compound indirubin (1) a number of readily soluble, almost colorless derivatives that potently and selectively inhibit the activity of the CDK2 enzyme and control the growth of MCF7 cancer cells in vitro.[26] Further results of our investigations into this fascinating class of molecules will be reported in due course.

with data on similar compounds already reported--our later compounds 28 a/b and 30 a/b are devoid of this activity (see Table 3). This elimination of gsk3 activity, while maintaining good CDK2 activity, is not compromised by any loss of selectivity against other kinases, such as EGFR, c-kit, InsR, and KDR (see Table 3). Recently there have been several reports showing that indirubins activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR).[18, 19, 20, 21] AhR, also known as the dioxine receptor, is an orphan nuclear transcription factor, similar to the hormone receptors, that plays an important and long-known role in the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism. AhR activation itself does not lead to toxic or carcinogenic effects, as the known toxins and carcinogens acting via the AhR do so by AhR-induced expression of

Pharmacological characterization of indirubin derivatives CDK2: GST-tagged recombinant human CDK2 kinase (50 ng) complexed with GST-tagged human cyclin E expressed in SF-9 cells (Proqinase, Germany) was incubated for 10 min at 22 8C in the presence of different concentrations of test compounds in a Tris/HCl assay buffer [40 mL, 62.5 mm, pH 8.0, MgCl2 (10 mm), dithiothreitol (1.0 mm), sodium orthovanadate (0.1 mm), PEG 20000 (0.025 % v/v), ATP (0.5 mm), g-33P ATP (0.2 mCi per well), calf thymus histone type IIIS (1 mm, Sigma­Aldrich, Germany), dimethyl sulfoxide (1.25 %, v/v), Nonidet P40 (0.05 %)].

The resulting mixture was incubated for a further 2 h at 22 8C to allow the binding of the biotinylated peptide to the streptavidine-XL665 and the amount of phosphorylated product was subsequently evaluated by HTRF measurement in a Rubystar (BMG, Germany). MCF7: MCF7 cells (ATCC, USA) were seeded in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrome, Germany) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10 %, PAA, Austria), l-glutamine (2 mm), estradiol (0.1 nm), and insulin (1 U mLÀ1) at 5000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h, and then fresh growth medium plus compounds were added. The final concentration of the solvent DMSO was 0.5 %. After 4 days of continuous incubation, the cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet, and the absorbance was recorded at 595 nm. All measurements were performed in quadruplicate. The values were normalized to the absorbance of solvent-treated cells (= 100 %), and the absorbance of a reference plate which was fixed at the time point of compound application (= 0 %). Half-maximal growth inhibition (IC50) was determined as compound concentration required to achieve 50 % inhibition of cellular growth. Physicochemical calculations and characterization c log D: Calculation was performed with the ACD/log D program version 6.0. (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc, Toronto, Canada) Sw: This was determined by turbidimetric measurements (kinetic solubility). A solution of the compound in DMSO (10 mm) was added gradually to aqueous buffer. Turbidity was measured by its effect on the transmission of light. The experiment was run at 25 8C in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The instrument was a HACH turbidimeter, the software for analysis and evaluation was an inhouse program. The system was calibrated with phenanthrene. Sw(t) (solubility in water determined by the flask method--thermodynamic solubility): A saturated solution of the compound in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 was stirred at 25 8C for 22 h. The solid was separated by filtration, and the concentration of compound in the solution was determined by quantitative HPLC. HPLC: Waters

Crystals of CDK2 were grown at 20 8C by vapor diffusion. CDK2 (1­ 298) at 5­7 mg mLÀ1 was mixed and equilibrated against PEG 3350 (10 %), ammonium acetate (0.2 m) at pH 7.8 (Hepes). Compound 14 was cocrystallized with CDK2, whereas 37 was soaked in existing CDK2 crystals. Prior to data collection, the crystals were transferred to a cryo-buffer containing PEG 3350 (10 %) and glycerol ( % 25 %) at pH 7.8 and were then flash-cooled in a cold nitrogen stream. Intensity data for 14 was collected at the synchrotron at the ESRF in Grenoble, and 37 was recorded on a rotating-anode system equipped with a three-circle diffractometer and Smart 6000 CCD area detector. The data for 14 were integrated with the HKL2000 package,[27] data for 37 were integrated with the SAINT program and corrected semiempirically for systematic errors such as absorption with the program SADABS. Both structures were solved with the aid of the program AMoRe.[28] Compound 14 was refined by use of SHELXL,[29] whereas 37 was refined with the CNS module in the Quanta program.
