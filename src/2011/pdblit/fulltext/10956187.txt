Substituted guanines and pyrimidines were tested as inhibitors of cyclin B1/CDK1 and cyclin A3/CDK2 and soaked into crystals of monomeric CDK2. O6-Cyclohexylmethylguanine (NU2058) was a competitive inhibitor of CDK1 and CDK2 with respect to ATP (Ki values: CDK1, 5 ( 1 µM; CDK2, 12 ( 3 µM) and formed a triplet of hydrogen bonds (i.e., NH-9 to Glu 81, N-3 to Leu 83, and 2-NH2 to Leu 83). The triplet of hydrogen bonding and CDK inhibition was reproduced by 2,6-diamino-4-cyclohexylmethyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine (NU6027, Ki values: CDK1, 2.5 ( 0.4 µM; CDK2, 1.3 ( 0.2 µM). Against human tumor cells, NU2058 and NU6027 were growth inhibitory in vitro (mean GI50 values of 13 ( 7 µM and 10 ( 6 µM, respectively), with a pattern of sensitivity distinct from flavopiridol and olomoucine. These CDK inhibition and chemosensitivity data indicate that the distinct mode of binding of NU2058 and NU6027 has direct consequences for enzyme and cell growth inhibition.
Introduction The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a family of serine-threonine protein kinases which control cell cycle progression in proliferating eukaryotic cells.1-5 The activity of CDKs is dependent upon the presence of cyclin partners whose levels are sequentially regulated to ensure that the phases of the cell cycle proceed in the correct order. For example, cyclins of the D family complex with CDKs 4 and 6 during G1 phase, cyclin E with CDK2 in late G1, cyclin A with CDK2 in S phase, and cyclin B with CDK1 (also known as cdc2) in late G2/M. Aberrant CDK control and consequent loss of cell cycle checkpoint function have been directly linked to the molecular pathology of cancer.6 For example, cyclin overexpression (e.g., cyclin D), loss of function of endogenous CDK inhibitors (e.g., p16 deletion or p21 loss secondary to p53 defects), and CDK substrate alterations (e.g., retinoblastoma gene mutations) have been widely documented in human tumors.6 These CDKrelated events are among the most common genetic changes found in human tumors and, clinically, they often confer a poor prognosis. In view of the strong link between CDKs and the molecular pathology of cancer, CDKs are being investigated as possible targets for therapeutic intervention.7-9

Chart 1. Chemical Structures of CDK Inhibitors

CDK inhibitors should function as non-DNA-interactive antiproliferative agents, thereby avoiding treatmentinduced DNA damage in normal tissues and the consequent carcinogenic risk. Furthermore, when used in combination with cytotoxic drugs, reestablishing an otherwise deficient cell cycle checkpoint may enhance the activity of conventional treatments. Studies with first-generation CDK inhibitors support a role for the use of these agents as both single agents and in combination with cytotoxic drugs (see below). A lead CDK inhibitor is flavopiridol (Chart 1a) which has recently completed Phase I clinical evaluation.10 Evidence of activity was seen in the Phase I trial of

flavopiridol, consistent with preclinical in vivo data,11,12 and Phase II trials are underway. However, enzyme inhibition studies have shown that the CDK specificity of flavopiridol is limited, CDKs 1, 2, and 4 being equally sensitive to inhibition by the compound.8,13 Consistent with the lack of CDK specificity, whole cell studies have shown that following treatment with flavopiridol cell cycle arrest can occur at either the G1/S and/or G2/M checkpoints.13-16 In the search for more specific CDK inhibitors a number of pharmacophores have been investigated, prominent among which are the 6-aminopurine-based inhibitors.17-24 Where studied, the 6-aminopurines have been shown to be competitive inhibitors with respect to ATP, and structural investigations with monomeric CDK2 have shown that certain of the compounds (e.g., olomoucine, roscovitine, and purvalanol B (Chart 1bd, respectively) bind as expected in the ATP binding site.21,25,26 However, the 6-aminopurines do not reproduce the hydrogen-bonding characteristics of ATP. Specifically, ATP forms a single hydrogen bond with Leu 83 of CDK2 through the N-1 position of the purine ring, and a second bond to Glu 81 through the N-6 position. In contrast, the 6-aminopurines interact with Leu 83 through the N-7 and N-6 positions, and Glu 81 via C-8.21,25,26 As part of a screening exercise, a series of guanine analogues were evaluated for their ability to inhibit CDK1. Surprisingly, given the lack of an exocyclic C-6 amino group and hence the potential for interaction with Leu 83 via this position, certain O6-alkylguanines were found to be CDK1 inhibitors (L. Meijer, personal communication). This paper describes the inhibition of CDKs 1 and 2 by selected O6-cyclohexylmethylguanines. The tumor cell growth inhibitory properties of O6-cyclohexylmethylguanines and O4-cyclohexylmethylpyrimidines designed to probe hydrogen bond interactions within the CDK2 active site, identified by crystal structure analysis, have also been determined. Materials and Methods
Chemistry. O6-Cyclohexylmethylguanine (NU2058, Chart 1e) was synthesized as previously reported,27,28 using either 2-amino-6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6-(1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-1-yl)purinium chloride as starting materials, respectively. The latter method has the advantage of easier purification of products and was also used to prepare O6-cyclohexylmethylpurine (NU2017, Chart 2a). O6-Cyclohexylmethyl-N9-methylguanine (NU6052, Chart 2b) was synthesized from 2-amino-

Purine and Pyrimidine CDK Inhibitors to room temperature, and the violet crystals were filtered off and washed well with water. The crude product was purified by recrystallization from EtOH (83%), mp 254 ∞C; 1H NMR  1.25 (m, 5H,), 2.0 (m, 6H), 4.4 (d, 2H, OCH2), 7.9 (s, 2H, NH2), 8.1 (s, 1H, NH), 10.2 (s, 1H, NH); HRMS (EI) m/z 251 [M+]. Anal. (C11H17N5O2) C, H, N. Enzyme Inhibition Studies. Inhibition of cyclin B1/CDK1 was assayed as previously described17 using enzyme prepared from starfish oocytes (Marthasterias glacialis). Inhibition of cyclinA3/CDK2 was determined using a similar assay and an assay buffer comprised of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 5 mM MgCl2. Cyclin A3/CDK2 was prepared as previously described30 (cyclin A3 is a C-terminal cyclin A fragment encoding residues 171-432). The final ATP concentration in both CDK assays was 12.5 µM ,and the IC50 concentration for each compound is the concentration required to inhibit enzyme activity by 50% under the assay conditions used. To determine the Km for ATP for cyclin B1/CDK1 and cyclin A3/CDK2, and Ki values for NU2058 and NU6027, assays were performed in the absence of inhibitor and at two fixed inhibitor concentrations (NU2058, 25 and 50 µM; NU6027, 5 and 10 µM), with ATP concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 800 µM. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using unweighted nonlinear least squares regression. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Human CDK2. Human CDK2 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus encoding CDK2 and purified following slight modifications to a published method.30 Monomeric unphosphorylated CDK2 crystals were grown as previously described.31 X-ray Crystallography Data Collection and Processing. The CDK2/NU2058 data set was collected from a crystal soaked for 48 h in 5 mM NU2058 in 1◊ mother liquor solution (50 mM ammonium acetate, 10% PEG 3350, 15 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) plus 5% DMSO. The CDK2/NU6027 soak conditions were 26 h in 5mM NU6027 in 1x mother liquor solution plus 5% DMSO. CDK2/NU2017 soak conditions were similar. Data for the CDK2/NU2058 complex was collected on beamline 9.5, SRS, Daresbury, U.K. The CDK2/NU6027 complex data set was collected on X-RAY DIFFRACTION at the Elettra Light source, and the CDK2/NU2017 data set was collected on BM14 at the ESRF. In each case data were collected at 100 K after crystals had been transferred briefly to cryoprotectant (mother liquor containing 20% glycerol). Images were integrated with the DENZO package and subsequently scaled and merged using SCALEPACK.32 Statistics for the CDK2/NU2058 and CDK2/NU6027 data sets are given in Table 1. Structure Solution and Refinement. The starting model for the structure solution and refinement of the CDK2/inhibitor complexes was the CDK2/ATP structure, PDB code 1HCK.25 This model included protein residues 1-36 and 41-298. Refinement of the structure was begun by carrying out rigid body refinement using REFMAC,36 using sequentially higher resolution data. As the resolution of the data included was increased from 3.0 ≈ to approximately 2.0 ≈, an increasing number of rigid bodies were used, so that initially the whole molecule was treated as a single rigid body, and finally fiveresidue segments were allowed to refine independently. Following rigid body refinement, the (Fo - Fc)Rcalc maps included readily interpretable electron density for the bound inhibitors. Clear electron density also defined those residues involved in interactions with the inhibitors. The structure was then compared with 2Fo - Fc electron density maps using the program "O",33 and minor structural changes were introduced. Following the first round of model building, a model of the appropriate ligand generated within SYBYL34 was built into the electron density map and included in subsequent refinement steps. Appropriate parameters for the geometric restraints in subsequent refinement by the program REFMAC were taken from the SYBYL minimized structure. Refinement was then pursued with alternating cycles of interactive model building and maximum likelihood refinement using the program REFMAC.35,36 Toward the end of the refinement, water

Cell Growth Inhibition Studies. The growth inhibitory activity of the compounds was evaluated in the NCI in vitro cell line panel using the standard 48 h exposure assay and inhibitor concentrations ranging from 10-9 to 10-4 M.38 Relationships between the profile of cell growth inhibition produced by the novel CDK inhibitors and that of standard anticancer agents, and the established CDK inhibitors olomoucine and flavopiridol, was investigated using the COMPARE algorithm.39

Results and Discussion The lead guanine-based CDK inhibitor O6-cyclohexylmethylguanine (NU2058, Chart 1e) was found to be an inhibitor of both CDK1 and CDK2 (Table 2). Enzyme kinetic studies demonstrated that the Km for ATP for both CDK1 and CDK2 under the assay conditions used was 50 µM (51 ( 5 µM and 53 ( 6 µM,

respectively, mean ( SD, n ) 4), and the Ki values for NU2058 were as follows: CDK1, 5 ( 1 µM; CDK2, 12 ( 3 µM (mean ( SD, n ) 4). Against both enzymes, inhibition by NU2058 was competitive with respect to ATP. Inhibitors were soaked into crystals of monomeric, unphosphorylated, CDK2 and the structures refined to the resolutions given in Table 1. The structure of CDK2 represents the minimal catalytic kinase core, constituted by two domains: a smaller N-terminal domain of approximately 80 residues formed principally from -sheet, and a larger (210 residue) predominantly R-helical C-terminal domain. The first complex characterized was CDK2/NU2058. Consistent with the enzyme inhibition data, NU2058 was found to bind within the ATP site of CDK2. A comparison of the refined structure to that of apo-CDK2,40 and to other CDK2-inhibitor complexes,21,25,26,31,41,42 revealed that NU2058 employs a number of novel interactions to bind to CDK2. Figure 1 shows the site of binding of NU2058 to CDK2 and the hydrogen-bonding pattern between NU2058 and the CDK2 backbone. As shown in Figure 1b, N-9 of NU2058 donates a hydrogen bond to the peptide oxygen of Glu 81, the NH group of Leu 83 donates a hydrogen bond to NU2058 N-3, and 2-NH2 acts as a donor to the carbonyl group of Leu 83. Although residues 80-84 constitute part of the hinge between the N- and C-terminal domains of CDK2, the interactions do not result in a significant change in relative domain orientation. Importantly, NU2058 binds into the ATP binding site cleft in a different orientation from that of the purines olomoucine, roscovitine, or purvalanol B (Figure 2).21,25,26 The hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl group of Glu 81, and the amide group of Leu 83, are also made by isopentenyladenine and ATP, while the hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Leu 83 is also seen in the complexes of CDK2 with olomoucine, roscovitine, and purvalanol B. Hydrogen bonds to these amino acids are also observed with members of the indirubin class of CDK2 inhibitors,42 although these are structurally dissimilar from NU2058. The binding of the guanine ring of NU2058 is not coplanar with that of the ATP adenine ring in the CDK2/ATP structure,25 and minor variations in ring position are observed among the inhibitors described here. The cyclohexylmethyl group at the O6-position of NU2058 occupies space close to where the ribose ring of ATP binds, although it cannot mimic the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the ribose 2- and 3-hydroxyls. In the apo-CDK2 structure, and in other monomeric CDK2-inhibitor complex structures, two regions of CDK2 have been reported to be flexible.25,31,40 The missing residues constitute the loop connecting strand 3 to helix RC, and the "activation segment" containing Thr 160 which is phosphorylated in the fully active CDK2-cyclin A complex.43 NU2058 binding to CDK2 is accompanied by a marked decrease in the main chain temperature factors for all residues, but it is particularly noticeable for residues in strand 1 and the activation loop and results in a readily interpretable electron density map for both these regions (Figure 3a). Additional interactions between the NU2058 O6-substituent and the glycine-rich loop accompany stabilization of the

The N-terminal domain (residues 1-82) is colored white, with the exceptions of the glycine-rich loop (residues 11-24) colored magenta, and the C-helix (PSTAIRE helix, residues 46-55) colored gold. The chain is broken at residues 36-43 for which there is no electron density in the maps. NU2058 is shown in ball-andstick representation at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domain is colored pink, with the activation segment (residues 145-172) highlighted in cyan. (b) Schematic drawing of NU2058 bound to CDK2.

activation loop (Figure 3a). These interactions are predominantly hydrophobic between the cyclohexyl group and a hydrophobic patch on the glycine loop contributed by the side chains of residues Val 18 and the peptide backbone around residue Gly 11 (Figure 3c). Residues in the activation loop do not interact directly with NU2058. The activation segment conformation is similar to that first reported by DeBondt et al.,40 for the structure of the monomeric CDK2/ATP complex. Ordering of both the glycine-rich loop and the activation

Conserved hydrogen bonds between the CDK2 backbone, at residues Glu 81 and Leu 83, and NU2058 are drawn as thin lines. Only CDK2 residues Phe 80 to Leu 83 in the CDK2/NU2058 structure are included for clarity. CDK2 carbon atoms are colored as for Figure 1a; NU2058 carbon atoms are green, and olomoucine carbon atoms are yellow. The O6-cyclohexyl substituent of NU2058 and the 2-hydroxyethyl group of olomoucine occupy the ATP ribose binding site. The olomoucine N6-group binds outside the ATP cleft. Roscovitine and purvalanol B bind to CDK2 in the same orientation as olomoucine.

segment is not observed in all guanine- and pyrimidinebased CDK2/inhibitor complex structures (results not shown). For example, binding of NU6027 to CDK2 does not result in ordering of these regions (Figure 3b). On the basis of the structure shown in Figure 1, two additional O6-cyclohexylmethylguanine derivatives were prepared in order to determine the relative importance of the hydrogen bonds at the 2-NH2 and N-9 positions of NU2058. These were O6-cyclohexylmethylpurine (NU2017, Chart 2a) and O6-cyclohexylmethyl-N9-methylguanine (NU6052, Chart 2b). As shown in Table 2, both compounds were less active than NU2058 as inhibitors of CDK1 and/or CDK2, implying that the hydrogen bonds formed by the 2-NH2 and N-9 functions of NU2058 can both contribute to the potency of the molecule. Of the two NU2058 derivatives NU2017 retained activity, particularly against CDK2, indicating that the hydrogen bond formed by the 2-NH2 is not indispensable. The CDK2/NU2017 structure confirmed that NU2017 binds to CDK2 within the ATP binding site in the same orientation as NU2058 (data not shown). In an attempt to reproduce the triplet of hydrogen bonds observed for NU2058 (Figure 1b) in a molecule lacking the purine nucleus, the pyrimidine NU6027 (2,6diamino-O4-cyclohexylmethyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine, Chart 2c) was prepared. In designing NU6027, note was taken of the need to maintain the 6-amino group (equivalent to N-9 in NU2058) in the correct orientation to enable hydrogen bonding with the peptide oxygen of Glu-81. To do so, a nitroso group was introduced at the 5-position in the expectation that the 5-nitroso group would form an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the 6-amino group, thereby establishing the correct geometry for the remaining hydrogen atom on the

6-NH2 group. As shown in Table 2, NU6027 was indeed a potent inhibitor of both CDK1 and CDK2, with Ki values of 2.5 ( 0.4 µM and 1.3 ( 0.2 µM, respectively (mean ( SD, n ) 4). As in the case of NU2058, the pyrimidine NU6027 was a competitive inhibitor of both CDK1 and CDK2 with respect to ATP. NU6027 was soaked into crystals of monomeric CDK2 and the structure refined to a resolution of 1.85 ≈. As shown in Figure 4, as anticipated, the 6-NH2 group of NU6027 donates a hydrogen bond to the peptide oxygen of Glu 81, the NH group of Leu 83 donates a hydrogen bond to N-1, and the NH2 group attached to C-2 acts as a donor to the carbonyl group of Leu 83. Importantly, the predicted intramolecular hydrogen bond between the 5-nitroso and 6-NH2 groups of NU6027 was observed, and this interaction was apparently the only contribution to binding made by the 5-nitroso group. To confirm the importance of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the 5- and 6-substituents of NU6027, the derivative lacking the 5-nitroso group was synthesized (2,6-diamino-O4-cyclohexylmethyloxypyrimidine, NU6034, Chart 2d). As shown in Table 2, NU6034 did not inhibit CDK1 or -2 at the concentrations tested, suggesting that the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the 5- and 6-substituents of NU6027, and hence the correct orientation of the 6-NH2 group, is required for activity. Having defined the unique interactions of the novel guanine- and pyrimidine-based CDK inhibitors with CDK2, the effects of the compounds on the growth of human tumor cells was investigated. Fifty-seven of the cell lines in the National Cancer Institute in vitro cell line panel were used for these studies in order to allow comparisons with other compounds, both standard anticancer agents and known CDK inhibitors. Table 2 shows the mean GI50 data (concentrations required to inhibit cell growth by 50% over 48 h) for the compounds investigated as CDK inhibitors. In the purine series, NU2058 was the most potent compound with a mean GI50 value of 13 ( 7 µM. The compound lacking the 2-NH2 substituent (NU2017, Chart 2a) was less potent than NU2058, a result consistent with the reduced activity of the compound as a CDK1 inhibitor (Table 2). The N-9 methyl derivative of NU2058 (NU6052, Chart 2b), which cannot by definition form a purine N-9 to Glu 81 hydrogen bond and did not inhibit CDK1 or -2 in the isolated enzyme assays, was not an inhibitor of cell growth in most of the cell lines (GI50 > 100 µM in 50/57 cell lines studied). Similar in vitro growth inhibition studies were performed with the pyrimidines NU6027 (Chart 2c) and NU6034 (Chart 2d). NU6027 was growth inhibitory with mean GI50 values of 10 ( 6 µM whereas NU6034, which cannot form an intramolecular hydrogen bond in order to orientate correctly the 6-NH2 substituent, was not growth inhibitory (GI50 > 100 µM in 49/57 cell lines studied). A COMPARE analysis was performed against the standard anticancer agent database for both NU2058 and NU6027. Neither compound generated Pearson correlation coefficients of >0.5 for the GI50 COMPARE analysis, and hence these CDK inhibitors have a pattern of cellular activity distinct from that of known classes of antitumor agents. Interestingly, the COMPARE analysis for the relationship between the GI50 sensitivity profiles of NU2058 and NU6027 versus flavopiridol and

The Connolly molecular surface of CDK2 is rendered looking onto the N-terminal domain at the surface of the glycine-loop sequence to show the hydrophobic region that interacts with the NU2058 O6-cyclohexyl group.45 The surface is colored such that regions showing a preference for hydrophobic interactions (as calculated by the program GRID46) range from yellow (strong preference) to gray (no particular preference). A hydrophobic patch generated by the side chain of Val 18 and the peptide backbone around Gly 11 is apparent.

olomoucine also yielded low Pearson correlation coefficients, i.e., 0.22-0.38. These low values are in contrast to the value for the relationship between flavopiridol and olomoucine (0.57), and NU2058 and NU6027 (0.65). Together with the enzyme inhibition and structural studies, these in vitro chemosensitivity data suggest that the distinct mode of binding of NU2058 and NU6027 to CDKs has direct consequences in terms of cell growth inhibition and differential activity with respect to other CDK inhibitors. The CDKs are prominent among novel targets for cancer therapy because of the frequency of abnormalities in genes which encode proteins that either directly (e.g., p 16, cyclin D) or indirectly (e.g., p 53) control

CDKs or are CDK substrates (e.g., retinoblastoma protein). Preclinical11,12 and more recently clinical10 studies with the prototype CDK inhibitor flavopiridol have shown that CDK inhibitors can have single agent antitumor activity, and initial combination studies with cytotoxic drugs are encouraging.44 The first generation of CDK inhibitors, exemplified by flavopiridol and olomoucine, have either limited specificity for individual CDKs (flavopiridol13) or relatively poor potency as inhibitors of the CDK enzymes and tumor cell growth (olomoucine17,18). Hence a number of groups have initiated analogue development programs focused largely on the 6-aminopurine pharmacophore.17-24 These latter studies have shown that it

Figure 4. NU6027 bound to CDK2. Conserved hydrogen bonds between the CDK2 backbone at residues Glu 81 and Leu 83 and NU6027 are illustrated by thin lines. The (2Fo Fc)Rcalc electron density for the CDK/NU6027 complex included in the figure was calculated at the end of the refinement (Rconv ) 21.3%, Rfree ) 28.1%) using map coefficients output from REFMAC with resolution between 20.0 and 1.85 ≈. The map is contoured at a level of 0.3 e≈-3, corresponding to 1.1 times the root-mean-square deviation of the map from the mean value. The intramolecular bond between the 5-nitroso group and the 6-amino group establishes the correct geometry for the 6-amino group to act as a hydrogen bond donor to the backbone oxygen atom of Glu 81.

to Glu 81 and purine 2-NH2 to Leu 83. The inhibitors so produced had either reduced activity against CDK1 (NU2017) or no activity (NU6052) at the concentrations tested. Importantly, the same relative effects were seen in tumor cell growth inhibition studies, i.e., reduced activity with NU2017 and no activity with NU6052, suggesting that growth inhibition in the whole cell activity was indeed a reflection of kinase inhibition. Detailed studies of the cellular pharmacology of NU2058 and NU6027, in comparison to olomoucine, are currently ongoing. Preliminary studies in MCF7 cells have shown that, consistent with inhibition of both CDK1 and CDK2, treatment with NU2058 and NU6027 causes a reduction in the number of cells in S-phase but not G1 or G2/M (J. Bentley and C. Arris, unpublished results). An important feature of protein structure-based drug design is the ability to predict novel pharmacophores once important sites for inhibitor-protein interactions have been identified. In the current study, identification of the triplet of hydrogen bonds formed between NU2058 and the ATP binding site of CDK2 led to the design of NU6027. Further detailed structure-activity studies based on both the guanine and pyrimidine pharmacophores are underway and will be described elsewhere. Acknowledgment.

is possible to develop CDK inhibitors with nanomolar potency as CDK inhibitors and mean GI50 values in the NCI cell line screen, or IC50 values for other human tumor cell lines, in the low micromolar range. The challenge in the area of small molecule CDK inhibitor development is currently to identify compounds with improved specificity for individual CDKs, coupled with greater in vitro potency against tumor cell lines. To meet this challenge, additional CDK inhibitor pharmacophores would be valuable, and the current report describes the identification of the guanine pharmacophore and novel pyrimidine-based inhibitors derived from a knowledge of the binding of the guaninebased inhibitors to CDK2. The lead compounds in the two series (NU2058 and NU6027) display CDK inhibitory potency similar to that of olomoucine, which has IC50 values against cyclinB/CDK1 and cyclinA or E/CDK2 of 7 µM,17 and activity against cell lines equivalent or superior to that of roscovitine (the mean GI50 of roscovitine in the NCI cell line screen is 16 µM18). These data suggest that NU2058 and NU6027 may be able to enter cells more readily than the 6-aminopurine-based inhibitors. High-throughput cell line screening and protein structure-based drug design are two of the most important contemporary approaches to drug discovery. However, it can be difficult to show that effects in whole cells of chemical changes to inhibitors, introduced on the basis of information from inhibitor-protein structures, are in fact due to interactions with the intended target of the compound. The approach taken here was to synthesize compounds designed to delete what appeared, from the NU2058-CDK2 structure, to be critical hydrogen bond interactions, namely, the bonds between purine NH-9
