Abstract The Cys2His2 zinc finger is one of the most common DNA-binding motifs in Eukaryota. A simple mode of DNA recognition by the Cys2His2 zinc finger domain provides an ideal scaffold for designing proteins with novel sequence specificities. The ability to bind specifically to virtually any DNA sequence combined with the potential of fusing them with effector domains has led to the technology of engineering of chimeric DNAmodifying enzymes and transcription factors. This in turn has opened the possibility of using the engineered zinc finger-based factors as novel human therapeutics. One such synthetic factor­designer zinc finger transcription activator of the vascular endothelial growth factor A gene­has recently entered clinical trials to evaluate the ability of stimulating the growth of blood vessels in treating the peripheral arterial obstructive disease. This review concentrates on the aspects of natural Cys2His2 zinc fingers evolution and fundamental steps in design of engineered zinc finger proteins. The applications of engineered zinc finger proteins are discussed in a context of the mechanism mediating their effect on the targeted DNA. Furthermore, the regulation of the expression of zinc finger proteins and their targeting to various cellular compartments and to chromatin and non-chromatin target templates are described. Also possible future applications of designer zinc finger proteins are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Preface Twenty years after the discovery of zinc fingers in TFIIIA of Xenopus laevis (Miller et al., 1985), Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins found their way to British daily press (Times, April 23, 2005; Guardian April 4, 2005) as a revolutionary tool for human gene therapy (Urnov et al., 2005). The journey from unravelling the structure of the first natural zinc finger to engineering customised zinc fingers capable of binding any DNA sequence and finally their first medical applications, led on the way to numerous discoveries and technological breakthroughs and resulted in a wide diversification of a field. Owing to space limitations this review concentrates only on fundamental steps in design and applications of engineered rather than natural zinc

finger proteins. It also additionally focuses on non-chromatin targets for designer zinc fingers, which are not fully covered by otherwise very comprehensive current reviews (Juliano et al., 2001; Pabo et al., 2001; Urnov and Rebar, 2002; Urnov et al., 2002; Falke and Juliano, 2003; Jamieson et al., 2003; Moore and Ullman, 2003; Uil et al., 2003; Blancafort et al., 2004; Klug, 2005a,b). 2. Aspects of Cys2His2 zinc fingers evolution The family of proteins bearing Cys2His2 zinc finger motifs constitutes a large subset of proteins with important functions. The Cys2His2 zinc finger is the most common DNA-binding motif encoded in the human genome and other multi-cellular animals. However, in addition to their DNA-binding properties, some zinc fingers are able to bind to RNA or proteins. The human genome is estimated to contain approx. 700 Cys2His2 zinc finger coding genes. There is a significant increase in a number of these genes when humans are compared to lower eukaryotes (e.g. yeast). The human Cys2His2 zinc finger genes are frequently organized in clusters (where cluster members are

tandemly arrayed on the chromosome) implying that gene duplication events might have played a primary role in expanding of this gene family (Schmidt and Durrett, 2004). In addition, proteins containing Cys2His2 zinc fingers have usually varying number of arrays of these motifs, for instance transcription factors Sp1 and Zif268 have three zinc fingers each and TFIIIA nine fingers. In some cases the positions of intron­ exon boundaries in the zinc finger coding DNA correspond to the repeating motif, as first shown for TFIIIA (Tso et al., 1986), suggesting that multi-fingered proteins may have also arisen by duplication of an ancestral single zinc finger domain. For many years zinc fingers had been believed to be restricted to Eukaryota. However, recent biochemical and phylogenetical studies confirmed their presence in prokaryotes (Bouhouche et al., 2000). Interestingly, the studies of phylogenetics distribution of prokaryotic Cys2His2 zinc fingers demonstrated that their presence is mostly restricted to bacterial species existing in close ecological association with eukaryotes (Bouhouche et al., 2000). Therefore, it has been proposed that these bacteria acquired Cys2His2 zinc fingers by horizontal gene transfer form eukaryotes. Against the above hypothesis on the Eukaryota-to-Prokaryota direction of Cys2His2 zinc fingers transfer, there is also the opposite possibility. All the bacterial species carrying Cys2His2 zinc finger coding genes belong to the -subdivision of the proteobacteria, from which mitochondria originated (Gray et al., 1999). Therefore, it can not be excluded that Cys2His2 zinc fingers have been inherited by eukaryotes via mitochondrial endosymbiosis (Moreira and Rodriguez-Valera, 2000). 3. The structure of Cys2His2 zinc finger and its interaction with DNA The zinc-coordinating DNA-binding proteins can be subdivided into at least three classes on the basis of their structure and the way of coordinating zinc: (i) One class is characterized by presence of the Cys6-zinc cluster motif (sometimes called Cys6 binuclear cluster) that can be found in metabolic regulators of Fungi (e.g. yeast GAL4) (Pan and Coleman, 1990). (ii) A second class containing Cys2Cys2 (or Cys4) zinc fingers contains conserved Zn-binding consensus of Cys­X2­Cys­X13­Cys­ X2­Cys that are found mainly in nuclear steroid or hormone receptors (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor). (iii) The third class contains the "classical" zinc finger domain Cys2His2 that is present in a large number of regulatory proteins represented in almost all the branches of the evolutionary tree. Despite the mechanisms of DNA binding being well understood in several families of DNA-binding proteins that coordinate zinc ions, it is mainly Cys2His2 zinc fingers that are used for designing proteins with novel DNA-binding specificities. The Cys2His2 zinc fingers were discovered in the TFIIIA transcription factor as repeated motifs of 30 amino acids, after biochemical experiments showed zinc binding and the presence of repetitive modular sequence elements (Miller et al., 1985). The repeated element contains a conserved sequence of (Tyr, Phe)­ X­Cys­X2­5­Cys­X3­(Tyr, Phe)­X5­Leu­X2­His­X3­5­ His (where X represents any amino acid; highly conserved

cysteins and histidines appear in boldface). A structural model proposed by Berg (Berg, 1988) was subsequently confirmed by the NMR studies (Lee et al., 1989; Neuhaus et al., 1992), which showed that a single Cys2His2 zinc finger unit consists of a compact  fold internally stabilized by chelatation of a single zinc ion. A zinc atom is coordinated by the conserved cysteins (within -turn) and histidines (within -helix); additionally the finger structure is also stabilized by interactions between the conserved hydrophobic residues. The characteristic DNA-binding mode of Cys2His2 zinc fingers was shown by the X-ray crystal structure of the DNA­Zif268 complex solved at 2.1Å resolution (Pavletich and Pabo, 1991). The structure revealed that one zinc finger typically recognizes three contiguous base pairs of a DNA sequence and that amino acid positions -1, 3 and 6 with respect to the start of -helix are responsible for contacting DNA. The DNA recognition is mediated through base contacts with the side chains of specific amino acids located on the recognition helix. Later studies showed that, in addition to helical positions -1, 3 and 6, position 2 also plays an important role in binding of Cys2His2 zinc finger to DNA. Phage display experiments (see below) together with other crystallographic data e.g. structure of the 2-finger Tramtrack protein complexed with DNA (Fairall et al., 1993) and the Zif268­DNA structure solved at 1.6A resolution (ElrodErickson et al., 1996) have emphasized the importance of crossstrand interaction between -helical position 2 and a base on the other strand of the DNA, complementary to target recognized by the amino acid in position 6 of the preceding finger (Fig. 1). The cross-strand interaction extends the binding site of a 2-finger protein from 6 to 7 bases and also synergistically links fingers into an overlapping array. Schematic representation of a hypothetical 2-zinc finger protein binding to DNA indicating key helical residues responsible for contacting DNA is presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. The model of DNA recognition by the classical zinc finger proteins. Each classical zinc finger consists of two -strands (represented as large arrows) and an -helix internally stabilized by chelatation of a single zinc ion (grey sphere). Adjacent zinc fingers F1 and F2 bind in a major grove of DNA target and recognize a seven-nucleotide-long binding site. The protein­DNA interaction is mediated by amino acids located at the N-terminal end of the -helix. The amino acid positions involved in contacting DNA are circled and contacted bases are depicted as squares coloured orange for F1 and blue for F2. Contacts to the primary DNA strand (positions X1 to X6) are made by amino acids in positions -1, 3 and 6 of recognition -helix (interactions marked as straight black arrows). While the complementary strand of DNA (positions Y- 1 to Y5) is contacted by amino acid in position 2 (gray circle). This cross-strand interaction, marked by the curved grey arrow, is responsible for the overlap between the F1 (orange) and F2 (blue) binding sites. Note that zinc fingers bind anti-parallel to 5­3 orientation of the primary DNA strand.

4. Design and selection of novel zinc finger proteins The simple "one-to-one" mode of DNA recognition by the Cys2His2 zinc finger motif provides an ideal scaffold for designing proteins with novel sequence specificities. Their modular nature allows for using zinc fingers like molecular building blocks in order to create multi-finger domains, which recognise extended DNA sequences. Additionally, unlike other DNA-binding motifs zinc fingers do not require palindromic targets and can function as monomers, which potentially allows them to bind to any given DNA sequence. 4.1. Methods of generating designer zinc fingers First experiments in constructing new binding variants of Cys2His2 zinc fingers of known specificities were based on finger shuffling, helix-grafting or site directed mutagenesis concerning single amino acids (Desjarlais and Berg, 1992; Thukral et al., 1992; Desjarlais and Berg, 1993; Shi and Berg, 1995). They have quickly given way to techniques, which allow for analysing simultaneously numerous randomisations within the contacting helix such as phage display (Choo and Klug, 1994a,b; Jamieson et al., 1994; Rebar and Pabo, 1994; Wu et al., 1995; Jamieson et al., 1996). Most of the phage display experiments used the mouse 3-finger factor Zif268 or human Sp1 as a framework. To accommodate the need for favourable cross-strand interaction in the neighbouring fingers, different strategies of library selections have been developed. Pabo's group favoured "sequential selection protocol", in which randomisations were introduced to one finger of Zif268 at the time, starting from F1 and at each of the three steps a new phage library was created (Greisman and Pabo, 1997). Segal and Barbas went around the interface problem by selecting individual fingers, which recognise sequence anchored by G (as in GNNG) and "stitching" them together (Segal et al., 1999; Segal and Barbas, 2000). Klug's group developed a Zif268 based bi-partite library approach, which not only solved the problem of the cross-strand interaction at the interface between fingers but also created universal libraries from which novel zinc finger proteins for any target can be selected (Isalan et al., 1998, 2001a). In this strategy one and a half fingers for a novel site are selected at a time in parallel steps for F1 plus part of F2 and for F3 and part of F2, respectively. A complete 3-finger protein is then recombined in vitro from the two halves. Recently Gendaq/Sangamo used this strategy in automated format to create large archives of two-finger modules of known binding specificities (Jamieson et al., 2003). Also various other bacterial and yeast selection and library screening systems were developed to select zinc fingers of novel DNA binding specificities (Cheng et al., 1997; Bartsevich and Juliano, 2000; Joung et al., 2000; Hurt et al., 2003; Hughes et al., 2005). Over the years a vast amount of information concerning DNA binding by either natural or engineered zinc fingers has been collected. It became apparent that certain amino acids in contacting positions exhibit preferences for certain DNA bases. This created a basis for a "recognition code", firstly postulated

by Desjarlais and Berg (1992) and extended by Choo and Klug (1994b). Zinc fingers created purely by rational design based on recognition code have been successfully used in mammalian system (Corbi et al., 2000; Libri et al., 2004), plants and plant viruses (Sera and Uranga, 2002; Sera, 2005). Nowadays, with advances in computer modelling (Paillard et al., 2004) and ever growing data bases of natural and synthetic zinc finger proteins, it is possible to obtain specific binders of high affinity by mixing and matching individual modules from various archives. A 4-finger protein recently used for gene correction was assembled from such archive modules and latter subjected to -helix optimisation (Urnov et al., 2005). Similarly a 6-finger transcription factor capable of regulating ICAM-1 was selected from a combinatorial library of randomly shuffled zinc fingers and latter optimised by rational design (Magnenat et al., 2004). 4.2. Zinc fingers for recognition of extended binding sites To achieve high specificity of binding in the context of a larger genome, longer arrays of zinc fingers are required. For example, a six-finger array is sufficient to bind unique targets in the human genome. However, since the periodicity of DNA does not exactly match the periodicity of zinc fingers in the array, linking additional fingers to Zif268 based framework by classical TGEKP linkers can put an excessive strain on the complex and not result in expected increased affinity (Liu et al., 1997; Kamiuchi et al., 1998). Slightly longer linkers based on canonical TGEKP and containing additional Gly and Ser residues seem to add extra flexibility and dramatically improve DNA-binding affinity of six finger proteins (Kim and Pabo, 1998). Flexible linkers containing Gly or Gly and Ser can be also used to span the gap in a discontinuous DNA binding site (Kim and Pabo, 1998; Imanishi et al., 2000). There have been also attempts to link 3-finger units by extended charged linkers (Imanishi and Sugiura, 2002) and structured "rigid" linkers designed to span a set number of DNA bases (Moore et al., 2001a). A unique 18 bp sequence can be also targeted with a zinc finger protein constructed as 3 sets of two fingers joined by extended linkers (3 × 2) rather than, as described above, two sets of 3 fingers (2 × 3) (Moore et al., 2001b). This new strategy for constructing multi-finger proteins has proven to be much more effective due to greater target specificity provided by the arrays of three 2-fingered modules. For some applications shorter 2 × 2 units based on the same design could be used (Urnov et al., 2005). Another approach to linking zinc fingers into longer arrays involves using dimerising domains such as GAL4 dimerisation domain (Pomerantz et al., 1998), leucine zipper dimerisation domains (Wolfe et al., 2000, 2003), hormone receptor dimerising domain (Beerli et al., 2000b; Xu et al., 2001) or phage display selected dimerisation peptides (Wang and Pabo, 1999). It has to be noted that increased binding affinity can also be achieved by using two non-covalently linked 3-finger proteins, which cooperatively bind to adjacent sites (Liu et al., 2001; Reynolds et al., 2003).

5. Applications of designer Cys2His2 zinc finger Applications of engineered zinc finger proteins are discussed here in a context of the mechanism mediating their effect on the targeted DNA. The "mode" of action depends on both (i) the nature of target site (e.g. promoter or coding region of a gene) and (ii) the type of effector domain (ED) fused to the zinc finger DNA binding domain (DBD). 5.1. Application of zinc finger DNA-binding domain used in the absence of functional domain Engineered proteins containing zinc finger motifs selected to bind a particular DNA sequence, which are not fused to any functional domains, can act via two main mechanisms. Proteins can constitute a physical barrier for enzymes acting on DNA (Fig. 2A-I) or compete with other DNA binding proteins e.g. transcription factors (Fig. 2A-II). In general, the interference by a zinc finger DBD used in the absence of any functional domain is relatively weak. However, the increase of binding affinity by combining several zinc finger modules can result in a more profound effect. In one of the examples, the inhibitory action of zinc fingers that are not fused to any ED has been achieved by affecting the RNA polymerase transcription machinery. Transcription downregulation has been observed in experiments with cell lines expressing a 3-finger protein engineered to bind specifically to a

unique 9 bp long chromosome translocation breakpoint of a BCR­ABL fusion oncogene associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. As a consequence, leukaemia cells rendered independent of growth factors by oncogene action, reverted to factor dependence upon expression of zinc finger peptide (Choo et al., 1994). This paper was the first to show that zinc finger constructs could be used to intervene in gene regulation in vivo. Different mechanism of action of zinc fingers that are not fused to any ED involves the competition between the zinc fingers and transcription factors for the binding in the promoter region. It has been documented that zinc finger proteins that selectively bound to an overlapping EGR1/SP1/WT1 regulatory site in the promoter of the MDR1 multidrug resistance gene are able to moderately block transcription by masking a target site for the transcription factor (Bartsevich and Juliano, 2000). Also in Papworth et al. (2003) a 6-fingered protein in the absence of any functional domain has been found to partly inhibit the transcription from the IE175k promoter of the HSV-1 virus. A dose dependent inhibitory effect on expression of this gene was achieved via targeting the sequence recognised by viral activator VP16 and therefore competing for binding. Artificial zinc fingers without any functional domain have also been used to target the replication origin of the Beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV). In this case a designer 6-finger protein efficiently blocked binding of the viral replication protein (Rep), which initiates virus replication, to the replication origin. Furthermore,

Fig. 2. Applications of designer Cys2His2 zinc fingers. The mechanism of action of artificial zinc finger factors depends on the DNA target site (grey and black DNA helix) and the effector domain (if any) attached to zinc fingers (3 orange rectangles). In each case DNA target bound by zinc fingers is marked in orange and framed, if it resides within promoter region. In absence of any effector domains (panel A) zinc fingers can be used as a natural barrier for the transcriptional complex progression (A-I) or to compete with other proteins (natural activators or repressors), which occupy the promoter region (A-II). Zinc fingers can be also used to create chimeric enzymes (panel B) capable of directly affecting DNA e.g. methylating (B-I), cleaving (B-II), mediating recombination/integration (B-III). In this mode of action the zinc finger binding site can be chosen in or outside the promoter region (as represented by doted framing over binding site in B-I). Engineered zinc fingers can be used as recombinant transcription factors targeted to the promoter region of the gene of interest (panel C). In this scenario novel transcription factors interact with other elements of transcriptional machinery and depending on the character of their effector domain exert either inhibitory (C-I) or stimulatory (C-II) effect on transcription. Engineered chromatin remodeling factors (C-III) can mediate either activation or repression.

transgenic plants expressing the zinc finger protein were resistant to viral infection due to complete inhibition of BSCTV replication (Sera, 2005). 5.2. Application of zinc fingers fused to effector domains that interact directly with DNA Engineered zinc finger technology allows for directing a range of DNA-modifying domains to a desired locus. Thus far, a variety of catalytic domains that act directly on DNA, namely DNA methyltransferase, integrase, resolvase and nuclease, combined with designer zinc fingers have been employed to modify DNA in a site-specific manner (Fig. 2B). A limited number of examples of methyltransferase catalytic activity targeted with zinc fingers have been reported so far (Xu and Bestor, 1997; McNamara et al., 2002; Carvin et al., 2003). The first zinc finger targeted methyltransferases were reported by Xu and Bestor (1997). These chimeric enzymes comprised of the CG-specific M.SssI methyltransferase fused to either Zif268 or its artificial derivative that was selected to bind the p53 site from the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene. Targeted methylation of the oligonucleotides that contained specific binding sites was observed in vitro (Xu and Bestor, 1997). Also combining methyltransferase M.SssI or M.CviPI (GC-specific) with the Zif268 evoked site-biased DNA in vivo methylation of the yeast CAR1 promoter containing a single, consensus binding site for Zif268 (Carvin et al., 2003). In addition, a fusion of 3-finger protein to a DNA methyltransferase M.HhaI or M.HpaII, which both are able to methylate 4 bp sequences containing a CpG dinucleotide, resulted in a specific DNA methylation in vitro (McNamara et al., 2002). Also the chimeric recombinases comprising a catalytic domain from mutated forms of bacterial Tn3 resolvase fused to a DNA recognition domain from the mouse transcription factor Zif268 have been recently reported by Akopian et al. (2003). These engineered chimeras catalyze efficient recombination specifically at synthetic binding sites for Zif268 in bacteria. Furthermore, recent in vitro studies by Tan et al. (2004) have shown that integration events provoked by HIV retroviral integrase tethered to artificial zinc finger protein can be directed to a 10-bp long region adjacent to the zinc finger binding site. Combining designer zinc finger peptides with the endonucleolytic cleavage domain allows the engineering of artificial restriction endonucleases with desired sequence specificities (reviewed in Carroll, 2004). An example of a protein able to cleave dsDNA in a sequence-specific manner was shown by Kim et al. (1996), where two different zinc finger proteins, Zif268 and Sp1, were linked to the cleavage domain of FokI endonuclease. Both chimeric proteins under optimal conditions cleaved DNA near the predetermined binding sites. The very recent work by Urnov et al. (2005) presented zinc finger protein fused to FokI endonucleolytic domain capable of producing specific sequence alterations by stimulating homologous recombination between the chromosome and an extrachromosomal DNA donor. The zinc finger peptide­FokI fusions designed against a X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)

mutation in the IL2R gene, were able to significantly increase the naturally sporadic events of homologus recombination in this locus and resulted in the 18% heterozygous and 7% homozygous gene correction in human cells. 5.3. Application of zinc fingers fused to effector domains that interact with other proteins Zinc finger peptides can be used to specifically direct protein domains that act through interaction with other proteins. In many applications, adding silencing or activation domains generates novel transcription factors to up or down regulate the expression of a gene of interest (Fig. 2C). Several kinds of independent repressor domain have been used in order to generate such transcription factors that include: Kruppel associated box (KRAB), ERF repressor domain (ERD), Mad SID or even parts of TATA-box binding protein (TBP) (Thiesen et al., 1991; Beerli et al., 1998; Stege et al., 2002; Bartsevich et al., 2003). On the other hand, widely used transcription activation domains include the herpes simplex virus VP16 domain as well as a tetrameric repeat of its minimal activation domain (called VP64) (Beerli et al., 1998) or the p65 domain of the human endogenous transcription factor NFB (Yaghmai and Cutting, 2002). Numerous convincing examples of how artificial transcription factors based on zinc fingers can be targeted to the promoter region in order to control endogenous gene expression have been reported so far. These include up regulation of the human erythropoietin gene (EPO1) (Zhang et al., 2000), the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) (Liu et al., 2001), the erbB-3 protoncogene (Beerli et al., 2000a) as well as silencing of the multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) (also known as ABCB1), the erbB-2 protooncogene (Beerli et al., 2000a) the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor- gene (PPAR) (Ren et al., 2002) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) (Tan et al., 2003). A very interesting example of how modulation of gene expression by zinc finger designer transcription factor can control cell fate of omnipotent embryonic stem cell (ES) has been recently shown by Bartsevich et al. (2003). The artificial zinc finger based transcription activator and repressor recognising 19bp have been targeted to the Oct-4 gene promoter (a major regulator of ES cell pluripotency and self-renewal) in order to regulate its expression. The up and down regulation of the Oct-4 gene affected the expression of downstream genes dependent on the Oct-4 regulator and thus modulated ES cell differentiation. It is well documented that histone modifications can change chromatin structure, and consequently expression pattern of a gene. Therefore, novel regulatory molecules could be generated by attaching chromatin-modifying domains (e.g. histone deacetylases, acetyltransferases or methyltransferases) to zinc finger DBDs (Fig. 2C-III). The efficient repression of gene expression by a synthetic zinc finger fused to chromatin remodeling domain has been demonstrated by Snowden et al. (Snowden et al., 2002, 2003). In these studies, a minimal histone methyltransferase domain has been fused to engineered zinc fingers targeted to the VEGF-A promoter. The resulting local methylation of histone H3 has triggered gene repression, which lowered the expression

of VEGF-A in a highly angiogenic, tumorigenic cell line to the levels comparable with a low tumorigenic cells. 6. Intracellular targeting of designed zinc finger proteins A success of engineered zinc finger protein depends on its correct delivery in a properly folded form to the right intracellular compartment and on gaining access to its target site. Also in a case of in vivo applications an important issue to be taken under consideration is the control of the intracellular concentration of the engineered zinc finger as first highlighted by Choo et al. (1997). This section discusses the regulation of the zinc finger expression and targeting to various cellular compartments and sub-compartments and possible matters associated with accessibility of target templates. Examples of engineered zinc finger proteins are grouped on the basis of their intracellular destination and a type of their target (Fig. 3). Also possible future applications are discussed. 6.1. Zinc fingers acting in the nucleus Zinc finger proteins are inherently nuclear and often even in an absence defined linear nucleus localisation signal (NLS) they

localise in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). Nevertheless, in most cases engineered zinc fingers destined to bind nuclear DNA have been equipped with a linear NLS to ensure their efficient transition from the cytosol to the nucleus. The nuclear targeting/ cytoplasmic retention of engineered zinc fingers can be used as an additional control mechanism, as demonstrated using chimeric activators comprising of zinc finger DBD and the modified ligand binding domain of steroid hormone receptor (Beerli et al., 2000b; Xu et al., 2001). Steroid hormone receptors, despite containing NLS, in the absence of the ligand are believed to remain inactive in the cytoplasm complexed with HSPs. Binding of the ligand causes conformational changes, which allows for dissociation from the complex, translocation to the nucleus and binding in dimeric form to the promoter DNA. The need for homodimerisation limits the choice of targets for the chimeric zinc finger proteins, to palindromic sequences. To overcome this restriction, Beerli has also constructed liganddependent zinc finger chimeras that contain duplicated ligand binding domain and function as monomeric single-chain regulators (Beerli et al., 2000b). Once inside the nucleus, zinc fingers should naturally home on DNA, "search" for the target and exert the effect determined by the nature of their effector domain, unless additional

Fig. 3. Intracellular targeting of designer zinc finger proteins. Synthetic zinc finger factors are based on the natural nuclear proteins and have been so far successfully used against various DNA targets in the cell nucleus (black solid arrows). This includes promoter (orange, frame) and non-promoter targets in chromatin (including integrated viruses), structural elements like telomeres (red) and not integrated viruses. Since all the zinc fingers originate in the cytoplasm, it should be possible to direct them to intracellular compartments other than nucleus, which also contain DNA (red dotted arrows) such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. It is also possible to use zinc fingers "against" DNA or RNA viruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm as well as other cytoplasmic targets e.g. specific RNA.

Fig. 4. Targeting of zinc finger proteins to mammalian mitochondria. A three finger protein based on Zif268 has been expressed transiently in COS-7 cells in absence of any localisation signals (A) or as a fusion with mitochondrial targeting sequence from VIII subunit of human cytochrome c oxidase (Rizzuto et al., 1992) (B). The panels show merged microscopic image of mitochondria (red) stained using MitotackerRed (Molecular Probes) and zinc finger proteins (green) visualized using antibodies against c-myc epitope tag followed by FITC conjugated secondary antibody. Co-localisation of the zinc finger and mitochondria appears in yellow in panel B.

regulatory elements are in place e.g. separation of the DBD from the ED. In this regulatory system two domains are expressed separately and can be only brought together by an externally supplied small molecule dimerizer. A tight dimerizerdependent regulation of the VEGF-A gene was achieved with such a bipartite activator targeted to the promoter of chromosomal VEGF-A gene (Pollock et al., 2002). To ensure correct targeting and assembly of the system both of the components­ DBD and ED­have to be equipped with their own NLS and preferably expressed in equimolar amounts. Also the zinc finger binding site should be chosen outside the regulatory region to ensure that the zinc finger domain cannot interfere with the expression of a target gene simply by binding to DNA (see Section 5.1). The VEGF-A gene has become a test ground for various novel systems involving zinc finger regulators, partly because modulation of its expression has a profound biological effect--activation (Liu et al., 2001; Pollock et al., 2002; Rebar et al., 2002) leads to angiogenesis while repression (Snowden et al., 2002, 2003) could potentially have a therapeutic effect on vascularizing tumours. An attractive regulatory mechanism has been used to create one of transcriptional repressors of VEGF-A where the zinc finger domain has been fused to the ligandbinding domain of thyroid hormone receptor 1 (Snowden et al., 2003). In the absence of ligand this chimeric protein represses transcription due to interaction of ligand binding domain with a co-repressor complexes associated with histone deacetylase. Upon addition of ligand, the co-repressor complex is substituted by co-activators, which result in transcriptional activation. Using such a dual-action transcriptional regulator potentially allows for a very precise control of the levels of gene activation/ repression by titrating amount of ligand. However for in vivo use it would need to be modified not to respond to endogenous hormones. 6.1.1. Reporter DNA Early experiments with engineered zinc fingers have been using reporter systems where one or multiple copies of target sequences are embedded in an episomal plasmid. It has to be noted that even non-integrated and a non-replicating reporter

can associate with transcriptional modulators and adopt nucleosomal structure (Cereghini and Yaniv, 1984; Reeves et al., 1985) typical for transcriptionally active chromatin (Jeong and Stein, 1994) and therefore, to some extent, resemble an endogenous gene. However, in most of the cases the effect of a recombinant transcription factor on the reporter gene is far greater than the one observed on the endogenous chromatin target, because of both higher copy number and greater accessibility of the reporter. Generally the levels of activation of transiently transfected templates are directly proportional to the DNA binding affinity of the synthetic activator, while activation at the endogenous locus depends also on numerous other factors associated with chromatin architecture (Zhang et al., 2000; Reik et al., 2002). A target gene for zinc finger regulator can be also carried by a viral vector, as demonstrated by Xu both in cell culture and an animal model (Xu et al., 2001). 6.1.2. Genomic DNA The most obvious target for engineered zinc fingers in the cells is transcriptionally active chromatin. The chromatin accessibility problem can be addressed at the design stage using either the "targeted strategy", where optimal targets are chosen within open chromatin hypersensitive to DNases (Liu et al., 2001) or the "carpet bombing strategy", where large number of potential sites are chosen spanning the region of interest as illustrated by Isalan et al. (2001a). The chromatin mapping with DNaseI and micrococcal DNase has been successfully used to guide regulatory engineered zinc finger proteins to accessible promoter regions in either plants e.g. the ADH promoter in Arabidopsis (HolmesDavis et al., 2005) viruses (Segal et al., 2004) or human cells e.g. checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) promoter (Tan et al., 2003) and PPAR promoter (Ren et al., 2002). In an absence of DNaseI-hypersensitivity, accessible sites can be predicted in the vicinity of known cis-regulatory elements as shown for zinc finger activators binding to -globin promoter (Graslund et al., 2005) or zinc finger repressors whose target sites overlap with Sp1 site in MDR1 promoter (Bartsevich and Juliano, 2000) or

with VP16 site in HSV1 IE175k promoter (Papworth et al., 2003). Alternatively, when structural information is not available, chromatin can be targeted by a whole arsenal of zinc fingers generated to sequences randomly chosen to cover large stretch of the e.g. promoter region. An example of this strategy has been shown by Isalan et al., where it was used to identify suitable binders in the HIV-1 LRT region (Isalan et al., 2001a). In addition, Sera and Uranga have designed the high throughput system for generating such zinc finger binders using nondegenerate recognition code (Sera and Uranga, 2002) and tested it in a plant reporter system. However, it has also been documented that engineered zinc finger activators have a capacity to gain access to inactive chromatin and remodel it by enforcing a DNaseI hypersensitive state upon activation (Zhang et al., 2000). Even actively imprinted genes can be targeted by synthetic zinc-finger factors as exemplified by reactivation of transcriptionaly silent alleles of H19 and IGF2 (Jouvenot et al., 2003). However in this case a target site for zinc finger activator did not contain CpG--a potential methylation island necessary for maintaining imprinted state, which possibly allowed for a greater permissiveness to the binding of transcription factors in this region. Many endogenous transcriptional regulators, but incidentally not zinc finger factors Sp1 and YY1 (Holler et al., 1988; Gaston and Fried, 1995), are sensitive to CpG methylation of their target sites. Despite the fact that endogenous zinc fingers do not differentiate between methylated and non-methylated targets, Choo and Isalan have managed to select artificial zinc fingers, which can distinguish between 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and cytosine within otherwise identical targets and exclusively bind one or the other (Isalan and Choo, 2000). Moreover, such engineered zinc fingers also discriminate between 5-mC and closely related thymine in DNA sequence. DNA methylation is critical in development and aberrations in methylation pattern are often associated with cancer, in theory zinc fingers specific for methylated DNA could became very useful in diagnosis and therapy. Although most of the genes targeted to date with engineered zinc finger regulators were contained within mammalian genome there have been a number of attempts to use zinc finger regulators in plants (reviewed in Segal et al., 2003) such as Arabidopsis (Guan et al., 2002; Sanchez et al., 2002; Van Eenennaam et al., 2003), maize and tobacco (Ordiz et al., 2002; Stege et al., 2002). A potential difficulty of using exogenous Zif268/Sp1 type zinc fingers to regulate plant genes arises not only from technical problems associated with gene delivery and targeting within often larger genome, but also from limited number of available plant regulatory domains and differences between mammalian and plant Cys2His2 zinc fingers. In endogenous plant proteins, adjacent fingers are typically separated by very long linkers, which affect their binding affinity (Yoshioka et al., 2001). Also the individual plant zinc finger modules contain a highly conserved sequence (+ 2) QALGGH(+ 7) in the -helical region, which in the animal zinc fingers is hypervariable. Consequently they appear to exhibit a different mode of DNA interaction (Takatsuji, 1999; Isernia et al., 2003). Recently developed zinc finger activators of the ADH

gene in Arabidopsis are the first examples of chimeric plant/ mammalian architecture which appear to be more suited to function in plant cells (Holmes-Davis et al., 2005). 6.1.3. Telomeres Telomeric DNA at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes contains characteristic guanine-rich repeats and plays a pivotal role in determining a number of cell divisions, which further impacts on both aging and cancer development. A number of experimental therapies involving binding telomeric sequences have been proposed (Neidle and Parkinson, 2002; Cuesta et al., 2003) including use of zinc fingers. However, under physiological conditions telomeric repeats are not easily accessible to zinc fingers because telomeres form four-stranded secondary G-quadruplex structures instead of double helix DNA. An oligonucleotide containing human telomeric repeats has been used to select a number of 3-finger binders. These have been shown to be both sequence dependent and G-quadruplex structure specific (Isalan et al., 2001b). One of those engineered zinc fingers has been recently reported to inhibit synthesis of telomeric DNA by the telomerase enzyme in vitro (Patel et al., 2004). 6.1.4. Viral DNA A number of human viral pathogens enter the nucleus of an infected cell and rely on accessory cellular factors to for their replication and transcription. These include majority of DNA viruses and also RNA viruses, which require DNA step in their replication such as retroviruses. In the viral life cycle, viral genome replication is directly linked and dependent on transcription of viral genes, therefore inhibition of transcription results in a reduced number of viral progeny. The strategy of targeting repression domains to viral promoters with engineered zinc finger DBD has been used in order to inhibit replication of the HSV-1 virus (Papworth et al., 2003) and integrated HIV-1 (Reynolds et al., 2003; Segal et al., 2004). In all these studies the 6-finger, rather than 3-finger, repressors have been found to be the most effective anti-viral agents. However, it has to be noted that HSV-1 and HIV-1 differ significantly in terms of their biology, structure and pathogenicity and it is difficult to compare both sets of experiments. HSV-1 is a large complicated virus, which encodes a number of its own regulatory proteins and during lytic cycle replicates extremely rapidly without integration. A 6-finger repressor was used to target a single distant site in one of the promoters of the immediate early genes, which resulted in a 10-fold repression of HSV-1 (Papworth et al., 2003). The success of this protein can be partially attributed to its competition for binding with a potent viral trans-activator VP16. Targeting VP16 responsive binding sites (5 TAATGARAT) in IE175k and other immediate early promoters would undoubtedly result in even greater inhibition (note: VP16 does not bind DNA but is a co-factor of OCT proteins). In contrast, the number of potential sites for engineered zinc fingers in the HIV-1 genome is very limited due to the small genome size and an extremely high mutation rate. One of the few accessible conserved regions is the LTR promoter. In two

independent studies (Reynolds et al., 2003; Segal et al., 2004) 6finger proteins linked to repression domains have been targeted to the HSV-1 LTR promoter and dramatically reduced HIV-1 replication. However only one of them, which competes for binding with a cellular activator Sp1, has been able to partially repress transcription in an absence of an effector domain (Segal et al., 2004). These studies have been recently extended by Kim et al. (2005), who created an HIV-specific repressor based on an Sp1-site binder. This potent inhibitor comprises of an engineered 3-finger DBD which competes with Sp1 for binding and two repressor domains; POZ of FBI-1, which specifically blocks the DNA binding domain of Sp1 and TatdMt, a mutant of Tat that represses transcription through competing with wt HIV Tat protein for binding to TAR element. This artificial zinc finger-POZ-TatdMt repressor has inhibited HIV-1 replication by over 4500 fold, however it is difficult to draw a direct comparison with previously reported 10­100 fold inhibition by zinc fingers­KOX fusion (Segal et al., 2004) due to differences in systems and cells used. It is significant that in the recent studies also a 3-finger protein in absence of any additional domains has repressed activated transcription by about 5 fold due to competition for the binding with the Sp1 activator. Similarly, competition for binding has been utilized to suppress replication of BSCTV virus (geminiviridae) in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Sera, 2005). 6.2. Zinc fingers acting in the cytoplasm Synthetic Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins are manufactured and correctly folded in the cytoplasm, however there are no natural targets for them in this intracellular compartment. Since natural and engineered zinc fingers can interact in a sequence/ structure specific manner with RNA as well as with DNA (Lu et al., 2003; Brown, 2005) specific zinc finger binders can be used to target cytoplasmic nucleic acids. This potentially includes genomes of RNA viruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm such as important human pathogens e.g. Hepatitis A, and C, rubella, polio, and influenza. Also large DNA viruses such as poxviruses and a family of African swine fever viruses replicate in the cytoplasm and their DNA could be targeted with engineered zinc fingers for both research and therapeutic applications. 6.3. Zinc fingers acting in the cellular organelles Apart from the nucleus the only other intracellular compartment of a healthy mammalian cell, which contains DNA, is the mitochondrion, and in a plant cell also the chloroplast. The only mitochondrial proteins containing classical Cys2His2 zinc fingers, which have been so far extensively studied are RNAbinding members of the editosome complex in tripanosomatids (Panigrahi et al., 2001; Worthey et al., 2003; Kang et al., 2004), but their applications are rather limited and specific to this group of organisms. However, the fact that zinc finger proteins have the potential to be targeted across mitochondrial double membrane, fold correctly and bind nucleic acids in the environment of

mitochondrial matrix opens a whole range of new applications (see next section). 7. Can zinc fingers become therapeutic agents for mitochondrial diseases? Mitochondria contain their own genome with local replication, transcription and translation functions, but they are not self-supporting entities and also rely on imported nuclear gene products. Recent studies have revealed that point mutations, deletions or rearrangements in human mitochondrial DNA are associated with a variety of genetic disorders (Schon, 2000). There is no effective treatment for these diseases caused by mtDNA mutations. While the option of gene therapy has been proposed this has so far not proven to be successful mainly due to difficulties in delivering active DNA to mitochondria (reviewed in Dimauro et al., 2004). One possible therapy for these diseases exploits the fact that in the majority of patients with mtDNA defects, a proportion of unaffected mtDNA molecules coexists with the mutated mtDNA within a single cell--a phenomenon known as heteroplasmy. Thus, in the case of heteroplasmy and because of the generally recessive nature of mtDNA mutations, zinc finger technology has the potential to be used as a novel therapeutic approach to treat patients with mitochondrial defects. In theory it should be possible to inhibit the replication of mutant mtDNA, by targeting mutations with specific zinc finger proteins, thereby allowing propagation of only the wild-type DNA molecules. Presumably, the binding of zinc fingers to DNA could create a physical barrier for polymerase during mtDNA replication, in an analogous manner to the disruption of transcription by customised zinc fingers, as first shown to be possible by Choo et al. (Choo et al., 1994). Another approach enabling manipulation of mitochondrial DNA replication could be fusion of zinc finger domains, which bind mutated mtDNA, to nucleolytic domains in order to selectively cleave mtDNA molecules. In order to assess the potential of employing zinc finger technology to manipulate replication of the mitochondrial genome we decided to verify whether they can be imported to mammalian mitochondria. Import of zinc finger peptides into mitochondria was facilitated by using a mitochondrial leader sequence i.e. the first 33 amino acids from VIII subunit of human cytochrome c oxidase (Rizzuto et al., 1992), which carried the zinc fingers across the mitochondrial membranes as shown in Fig. 4. This result has prompted us to explore further the potential of using engineered mtDNA-specific zinc finger proteins to intervene in mtDNA replication and transcription.
