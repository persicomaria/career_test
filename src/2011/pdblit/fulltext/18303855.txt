Orotidine 5-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase from Plasmodium falciparum (PfODCase, EC 4.1.1.23) has been overexpressed, purified, subjected to kinetic and biochemical analysis, and crystallized. The native enzyme is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 38 kDa. The saturation curve for OMP as a substrate conformed to Michaelis­Menten kinetics with Km ) 350 ( 60 nM and Vmax ) 2.70 ( 0.10 µmol/min/mg protein. Inhibition patterns for nucleoside 5-monophosphate analogues were linear competitive with respect to OMP with a decreasing potency of inhibition of PfODCase in the order: pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate (Ki ) 3.6 ( 0.7 nM) > xanthosine 5-monophosphate (XMP, Ki ) 4.4 ( 0.7 nM) > 6-azauridine 5-monophosphate (AzaUMP, Ki ) 12 ( 3 nM) > allopurinol-3-riboside 5monophosphate (Ki ) 240 ( 20 nM). XMP is an 150-fold more potent inhibitor of PfODCase compared with the human enzyme. The structure of PfODCase was solved in the absence of ligand and displays a classic TIM-barrel fold characteristic of the enzyme. Both the phosphate-binding loop and the R5-loop have conformational flexibility, which may be associated with substrate capture and product release along the reaction pathway.

ABSTRACT:

Despite more than a century of efforts to control malaria, the disease remains a major and growing threat to public health. Malaria is caused by four species of the parasitic protozoan genus Plasmodium: P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ViVax, and P. oVale. Of these species, P. falciparum is responsible for most of the 500 million cases of malaria worldwide and for 2­3 million annual deaths (1, 2). Biochemical differences between the parasite and host provide a rational basis for the development of antimalarial drugs. One example of this approach is to identify enzymes or metabolic pathways vital for the survival of the parasite that are not essential for the human host. Appropriate enzyme inhibitors could then be developed to block enzymes in these pathways. The de noVo pathway for the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides in P. falciparum provides essential precursors for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Unlike its host, the intraerythrocytic form of the parasite is unable to salvage preformed pyrimidines from its environment and must synthesize pyrimidine nucleotides de noVo (3, 4). As the mature human erythrocyte lacks the de noVo pyrimidine

pathway (5), blockade of this pathway could lead to selective death of the intraerythrocytic parasite. The pathway comprises 6 enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the last catalyzed by orotidine 5-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase1). ODCase decarboxylates orotidine 5-monophosphate (OMP) to uridine 5-monophosphate (UMP, Figure 1a and b). In prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes (such as yeast and Plasmodium), the enzymes catalyzing reactions 5 and 6 exist on separate proteins. In mammals, reactions 1­3 and 5 and 6 are contained on multifunctional enzymes. Reactions 5 and 6 are catalyzed by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and ODCase, collectively named UMP synthase (6­9). ODCases are the most catalytically proficient enzymes known, enhancing the rate of reaction by a factor of 1017 over the uncatalysed reaction. This rate enhancement is achieved without the aid of metals, cofactors, or the formation of a covalent intermediate (10, 11). Currently, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains some 40 ODCase structures from mostly prokaryotic organisms, many deposited by structural genomics consortia and not otherwise published. Organisms whose ODCase structures are accompanied by journal descriptions include Escherichia coli (12, 13), Bacillus subtilis (14), Saccharomyces cereVisiae (11, 15, 16), Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (comprising almost half the structures, including complexes with UMP, 6-azauridine 5-monophosphate (AzaUMP, Figure 1c),

barbiturate 5-monophosphate (BMP, Figure 1d) and xanthosine 5-monophosphate (XMP, Figure 1f)) (17­20), and most recently Plasmodium falciparum2. ODCase structures released prior to publication include those from Thermatoga maritima (1 structure, PDB code 1VQT); Pyrococcus horikoshii (3 structures, 2CZD, 2CZE, and 2CZF, the latter containing XMP); the pathogenic malarial species, P. yoelii (1 structure containing selenium-substituted methionine residues, 2AQW), P. ViVax (2 structures, 2FFC containing UMP and 2GUU containing AzaUMP), P. berghei (1 structure, 2FDS), P. falciparum (2 structures, 2F84 and 2Q8L); and Homo sapiens (4 structures, 2JGY, 2EAW, 2P1F and 2V30, the latter containing UMP). All ODCases are dimers within the crystal, and the active sites contain residues contributed by both subunits. A catalytic tetrad of noncontiguous residues, Asp-Lys-Asp-Lys, is absolutely conserved and forms a chain of alternating charges lining one end of the binding pocket for the aromatic base. The central pair of these residues, positioned directly opposite the C6 position of the UMP product, are particularly important to the catalytic mechanism, which remains undefined despite numerous mechanistic proposals (11). In the "electrostatic stress mechanism" (19), for example, the juxtaposition of the carboxylate of OMP with the central aspartate of the AspLys-Asp-Lys motif might lead to destabilization and loss of the carboxylate moiety. The central lysine might facilitate donation of a proton to the resultant carbanion intermediate. Association of OMP with the active site is probably initiated by capture of the phosphoribosyl group. Once tethered, the carboxylated pyrimidine ring is delivered into the narrow active-site cleft, despite likely charge­charge repulsion. Such a combination of both attractive and repulsive forces in a catalytic mechanism has been dubbed the Circe effect (21). For comprehensive reviews see Miller and Wolfenden (11) and Wu and Pai (18). With a view toward developing potent inhibitors specific to the ODCase of P. falciparum, the enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized.
2 A brief description of low-resolution structures of P. falciparum ODCase (PDB codes 2ZA1, 2ZA2, and 2ZA3) was recently published (42) and is discussed further in footnote 3.

ODCases are known to be inhibited by a number of nucleoside 5-monophosphate analogues (22). Inhibitory properties were determined for some of these analogues; Pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate (Figure 1e), allopurinol-3riboside 5-monophosphate (Figure 1g), AzaUMP, and XMP. Interestingly, XMP proved to be a potent inhibitor of the PfODCase enzyme (Ki ) 4.4 ( 0.7 nM), binding 150fold more tightly to the parasitic enzyme than to the human enzyme. A single crystal of PfODCase was obtained and X-ray diffraction data collected. The structure of PfODCase, phased from a P. falciparum ODCase structure in the PDB (PDB code 2F84), reveals differences that suggest this structure is likely to be a more active enzyme conformation, while the pre-existing structure represents a fold more likely to correspond to a resting or ground-state conformation of the enzyme. Such conformational dynamics are discussed in relation to ODCase structures available from other organisms. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES OVerexpression and Purification of Recombinant PfODCase. Competent E. coli was cotransformed with the plasmids pMICO (23) and pET3d-ODC3 (24), that carry rare tRNAs and PfODCase, respectively. Cultures containing ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and chloramphenicol (50 µg/mL) were grown in Luria­Bertani broth at 37 °C until an optical density of 1.8 (600 nm) was reached, after which the temperature was reduced to 25 °C, and the cells were induced with isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 250 µM) for 16 h. Post harvest, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (Tris)-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol at pH 8.0 (Buffer A). After centrifugation (39,000g, 30 min, 4 °C), the soluble fraction was loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose column (1 × 5 cm, Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. After an additional wash containing 20 mM imidazole, PfODCase was eluted with running buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The polyhistidine tag was removed with thrombin (0.06 units/mg protein, Roche) in Buffer A containing 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM CaCl2 at pH 8.5, at 4 °C overnight. Cleaved PfODCase was

Langley et al. tography on poly(ethylene)imine-cellulose with 0.4 M LiCl and 0.1% formic acid. AzaUMP was purified from the phosphotransferase reaction mixture by a procedure modified from Brusilow and Hauser (28). The mixture was chromatographed on a Partisil 10-SAX column (Phenomenex) equilibrated with 0.08% formic acid and 35% methanol at pH 2.8, and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M ammonium formate (pH 3.0). Synthesis and purification of allopurinol3-riboside 5-monophosphate and Pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate from reaction mixtures were as for AzaUMP. Assay of PfODCase. Assay mixtures containing 25 mM 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 5% glycerol (pH 7.2), and different concentrations of [2-14C]OMP were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and reactions were started by the addition of 33 pg of pure cleaved PfODCase. Km and Vmax values were determined by measurement of initial reaction velocities in duplicate with at least 8 OMP concentrations. Samples (6 µL) of the assay mixture were taken at three times and spotted onto poly(ethylene)imine-cellulose thin layer chromatograms. 14C-labeled UMP was separated from OMP by ascending chromatography with 0.3 M LiCl and 1% (v/v) formic acid at 4 °C. 14C-labeled OMP and UMP were quantified with a Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). This sensitive radioassay enabled true initial reaction velocities to be determined with less than 5% conversion of [2-14C]OMP to [2-14C]UMP. The recombinant PfODCase was stored in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 10% glycerol at pH 8.0, in small aliquots at ­80 °C. For each experiment, a fresh aliquot was thawed and diluted just before use. With these precautions, the enzyme was stable for the duration of the assay (20 min) and gave reproducible reaction velocities. Inhibition Patterns for Nucleoside 5-monophosphate Analogues. The initial reaction velocities for PfODCase were determined at 5 concentrations of both inhibitor and [2-14C]OMP. Inhibitors assayed were AzaUMP, allopurinol3-riboside 5-monophosphate, Pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate, XMP (Sigma-Aldrich), and barbiturate riboside 5-monophosphate (BMP, a gift from Dr. L. Kotra, University of Toronto). The kinetic data obtained were used to construct double reciprocal plots of 1/ versus 1/[OMP] at different concentrations of each inhibitor. Initial velocity experiments were carried out in 50 mM MOPS, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol at pH 7.2. Kinetic data were fitted by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA) to eq 1 describing competitive inhibition:  ) Vmax[OMP]/((1 + [I]/Ki)Km + [OMP]) (1)

then passed over Ni-NTA-agarose resin (collected as the flow-through fraction) and stored in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol at pH 8.0. Cleaved PfODCase (3 mg) was further purified on a BioCAD chromatography system (GMI, Ramsey, MN) using a POROS-HS cation exchange column (4.6 × 100 mm, GMI) equilibrated with 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) and 10% glycerol at pH 6.8, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0­1 M NaCl. The PfODCase was further purified as a single peak on a Superdex-200 size-exclusion column (1 × 40 cm) eluted with 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM dithiothrietol (DTT) at pH 7.2. The approximate molecular weight of the peak was determined with a miniDawn multiangle laser light-scatterer (MALLS, Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA). The identities of both histidine-tagged and untagged PfODCase were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a LCQ Classic mass spectrometer (Thermoquest, San Jose, CA). Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (25) (BioRad), and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Enzymic Synthesis of [2-14C]OMP. [2-14C]OMP was synthesized using a modification of the method of Rawls (26). The reaction mixture contained [2-14C]orotic acid (1.20 mM, 55 Ci/mol, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA), 20 units/ mL of OMP pyrophosphorylase (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 units/ mL of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich), 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 53 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5.3 mM MgSO4, and 22.8 mM 5-phosphoriboribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 25 µL. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, terminated by the addition of 0.2 M ice-cold perchloric acid, and neutralized with 2 volumes of organic base (7.7 parts chloroform:2.3 parts trioctylamine). The mixture was centrifuged, and the upper aqueous phase was collected and chromatographed on a Partisil 10-SAX column (250 × 4.60 mm, 10 µm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) equilibrated with 50 mM ammonium formate (pH 3.0). [2-14C]OMP was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1­1 M ammonium formate (pH 3.0) and fractions that absorbed at 275 nm were pooled. The ammonium formate was removed by chromatography on Dowex 50 × 8 resin (100­200 mesh, hydrogen form, SigmaAldrich). The yield of [2-14C]OMP was determined using a Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) with dilutions of standard [2-14C]orotate and the unknown [2-14C]OMP. The 14C-labeled spots on poly(ethylene)imine-cellulose thin layer chromatograms were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Synthesis and Purification of Nucleoside 5-monophosphate Analogues. The procedure for the phosphorylation of 6-azauridine at the 5-position was adapted from Fyfe et al. (27). 6-Azauridine (20 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (250 mM), phosphotransferase (partially purified from Serratia marcescens; 0.5 mg protein per 1 mL of reaction mixture), and sodium acetate (300 mM, pH 5.0) at 37 °C for 7 days. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold perchloric acid (0.2 M) and the mixture centrifuged. The supernatant was neutralized with an equal volume of organic base (trioctylamine/freon) and centrifuged. The upper aqueous phase containing the nucleoside 5-monophosphate was analyzed by thin layer chroma-

Crystallization and Collection of X-ray Diffraction Data. A single crystal of PfODCase was grown by the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method whereby an equal volume of protein solution (PfODCase at 10 mg/mL in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mM sodium chloride, and 5 mM DTT) was combined with an equal volume of well solution (100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 2 M sodium formate). A lone crystal was observed after a two-year incubation at room temperature. The crystal was snap frozen in a stream of

Diffraction data were recorded in-house on a Mar345 image-plate detector (Marresearch) using Cu KR X-rays ( ) 1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator with Osmic mirror optics (both Rigaku). Reflections were indexed and scaled using the HKL software suite (29). X-ray Structure Refinement. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (30), part of the CCP4 suite of crystallographic software. The search model comprised the PfODCase structure already in the PDB (PDB code 2F84) stripped of solvent molecules and phosphate ions. An initial low-resolution round of rigidbody refinement was followed by multiple rounds of restrained B-factor refinement using REFMAC5 (31). Between rounds of refinement, the model was manually inspected and adjusted in conjunction with electron density maps using COOT (32). Solvent molecules were added if warranted by sufficient electron density and sensible geometry. Calculation of the buried dimerization surface was performed with areaIMOL (33). Structure validation was performed using the MOLPROBITY server (34). RESULTS Characterization of Recombinant PfODCase. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified PfODCase showed a single band with a molecular mass of 38 kDa. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to a MALLS detector gave a molecular mass for the enzyme particle of 76 kDa (data not shown) consistent with a homodimer; the molecular mass of the tagless monomer was calculated to be 37.8 kDa. Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the enzyme to be dimeric in solution with an estimated weight-average molecular mass of 66­80 kDa (data not shown).

Kinetic Analysis of Inhibitors of PfODCase. Km and Vmax values of PfODCase for OMP were determined by measurement of initial reaction velocities in duplicate at 8 concentrations of [14C]OMP to give Vmax ) 2.7 ( 0.10 µmol/min/mg protein, and KmOMP ) 350 ( 60 nM. A pH-rate (Vmax) curve determined for PfODCase from pH 4.5­9.0 showed an optimum at pH 7.3 in buffer containing 5% glycerol and 150 mM NaCl. The enzyme is susceptible to dilution inactivation and was stabilized with glycerol (5­10% v/v) and NaCl (150 mM) in purification and storage buffers. Inhibition patterns intersecting on the ordinate, consistent with competitive inhibition, were obtained for AzaUMP, allopurinol-3-riboside 5-monophosphate, Pyrazofurin 5monophosphate, XMP, and BMP. Data for all inhibitors except BMP were linear competitive with respect to OMP (Figure 2) and were fitted by nonlinear regression to eq 1 to determine the kinetic parameters (Table 1). The nucleoside 5-monophosphate analogues showed a decreasing potency of inhibition of PfODCase in the order: Pyrazofurin 5monophosphate (Ki ) 3.6 ( 0.7 nM) > XMP (Ki ) 4.4 ( 0.7 nM) > AzaUMP (Ki ) 12 ( 3 nM) > allopurinol-3-

The active sites are indicated by stick representations of UMP superposed from the P. ViVax structure (PDB code 2FFC). (b) Different PfODCase conformations. PfODCase solved in this work (tan) is superposed with other malarial structures differing in the position of the R5-loops (blue, PDB code 2F84; orange, PDB code 2Q8L). Labeled residues and superposed UMP are shown as sticks. (c) Superposed ODCases from P. falciparum (tan), P. ViVax (cyan), P. yoelii (pink), and P. berghei (orange). All B-subunits are colored gray. Q269 (sticks) projects from the phosphate-binding loop (closed for P. ViVax, open for P. falciparum). UMP is from the P. ViVax structure. M168B is shown in two conformations (sticks), corresponding to active- (gray) and resting- R5-loop (blue) PfODCase conformations.

riboside 5-monophosphate (Ki ) 240 ( 20 nM). The results of Figure 2 summarized in Table 1 indicate that all inhibitors bind more tightly to PfODCase than the substrate OMP. The potent inhibitor BMP, showed complex nonlinear kinetics, and data were not fitted to a velocity equation describing inhibition (Shojaei, M, Kotra, L., and Christopherson, R. I., data not shown). Global Fold of Malarial ODCases. The structures of ODCases from P. falciparum, P. ViVax, P. yoelii, and P. berghei are relatively recent additions to the PDB. All four have the canonical ( R)8 TIM-barrel fold typical of the enzyme, with the active site sitting at the C-terminal end of the -strands forming the barrel (Figure 3a). In each case, the R-helical components connecting the -strands of the TIM-barrel are well defined. All crystallize as dimers, with the active site partially formed by the dimer interface. The folds of the P. ViVax, P. yoelii, and P. berghei structures superpose well across nearly the entire length of the protein, regardless of the presence or absence of a ligand in the active site. In contrast, the P. falciparum structures (PDB codes 2F84 and 2Q8L), although similar to the other malarial species, adopt a distinctly different fold starting at the C-terminus of the 5 sheet and extending into the R5-loop that contributes to the dimerization surface (Figure 3a, magenta ribbon). Open and Closed 5-Strand and R5-Loop Conformations. Crystallographic and refinement statistics for our PfODCase

structure are presented in Table 2. Despite the resolution of this structure being modest (2.2 Å), all active site residues are well defined by the electron density and are unambiguously modeled. The two subunits of the dimer present in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical (root-meansquare deviation 0.39 Å for 314 CA positions, Table 3). The fold of our PfODCase (Figure 3a) closely resembles the structures from the other species of Plasmodium with the 5 strand positioned such that residues T194, T195, and N196 form one end of the active site pocket (Figure 3a, magenta ribbon and Figure 3b, tan ribbons and sticks). Hence, with respect to the conformation of the R5-loop, we refer to our structure of PfODCase as the active conformation of the enzyme (PfODCase-act). When superposed with the PfODCase structures 2F84 and 2Q8L, residues 192­212 that constitute the C-terminal end of the 5-strand and the R5-loop adopt a different peptide backbone path (Figure 3b, blue and orange ribbons, respectively). The 2Q8L and 2F84 structures share the same peptide backbone fold until T195, where they also diverge to follow distinct paths. In both conformations, residues that would normally line the active site cavity are withdrawn, resulting in the active site pocket being considerably more open. Hence, with respect to the R5-loop, these structures may represent resting or ground-state conformations of the enzyme (PfODCase-rest). The conformational flexibility inherent in this region is exemplified by residues 204­210

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 12, 2008 3847 ActiVe Sites of the Malarial Enzymes. The homology of amino acid sequences between the four malarial ODCases is high (Table 3), and the residues proposed to line the active site are conserved (24, 35). The structure is also conserved except for the conformation of the R5-loops of the PfODCase-rest structures noted above. The P. ViVax ODCase structures contain either UMP or AzaUMP in essentially identical active-site positions. The P. yoelii structure has a sulfate ion occupying the phosphate-binding site, while the P. berghei structure has an iodide ion in the aromatic ringbinding half of the active site. The side chain of R294 in the P. berghei structure (P. falciparum numbering is used for all malarial structures), expected to hydrogen bond the phosphate group of OMP (Figure 4a), is in a different conformation compared to the other malarial structures. Additionally, residues A268, Q269, and D270, which form the so-called phosphate-binding loop (19) are unresolved in the P. berghei structure. The conformation of these three residues is conserved in the P. ViVax and P. yoelii structures, with the side chain of Q269 extending into the active site pocket such that the NE2 nitrogen hydrogen-bonds both the O2 carbonyl oxygen of UMP or AzaUMP (P. ViVax structures) and an oxygen of the 5-phosphate (or sulfate in the case of the P. yoelii structure) (Figure 3c, dashed lines), a closed conformation of the phosphate-binding loop. This loop in the P. falciparum structures is oriented in an open conformation (PDB 2F84 and A-subunit of PfODCase-act, Figure 3c) or is unresolved (PDB 2Q8L and B-subunit of PfODCase-act). In the A-subunit of PfODCase-act, the open loop participates in crystal contacts with a nondimer molecule of the crystal lattice (Table 3). The dynamic nature of the phosphate-binding loop might involve substrate capture and product release. Our unliganded PfODCase-act structure contains well-ordered water molecules in both active sites of the dimer (Figure 4b, red and yellow transparent spheres). Interestingly, although the amino acid side chains of residues directly adjacent to these waters are essentially identically positioned in the two active sites, some of the waters are uniquely positioned. In contrast, solvent molecules occupy predominantly different positions in the PfODCase-rest structures. ODCases from Other Organisms. We have compared our PfODCase structure with ODCases from H. sapiens, S. cereVisiae, P. horikoshii, M. thermoautotrophicum, B. subtilis, E. coli, and T. maritima (Table 3). Although available in the PDB, many of these structures are not described in the literature. The human ODCase is of particular interest as differences with Plasmodium might be exploited for development of antimalarial drugs. ODCases from P. horikoshii (a hyperthermophile archaeon, PDB code 2CZF) and M. thermoautotrophicum (PDB code 1LOL) are the only structures containing XMP, shown here to preferentially bind PfODCase compared with the human enzyme (Table 1). All other ODCases have the same basic dimeric TIM-barrel scaffold described for the malarial enzymes. The malarial enzymes have an additional 55 residues inserted at the R1loop, which forms an R-helical bundle (Figure 3a, red ribbon). More minor differences concern the size and conformation of the R5-loop, which is generally smaller in nonmalarial ODCases, and the size and disposition of the phosphate-binding loop (discussed below).

being unresolved in the 2Q8L structure. Additionally, the side chain of a methionine residue that projects from the dimer partner into the active site pocket (M168B) is positioned differently in the PfODCase-rest structures (Figure 3c, carbons as blue sticks). The R5-loop, observed in multiple conformations in PfODCase structures, also contributes to the dimer interface where it interacts with the analogous component from the other subunit of the dimer, bisected by either a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (our structure, with a dimer in the asymmetric unit) or by a crystallographic 2-fold axis (2F84 and 2Q8L, with monomers in the asymmetric unit; Table 3). The different arrangements of this loop are reflected in the different monomer­dimerization surfaces calculated totaling 2400, 1900, and 1600 Å2 for the PfODCaseact, 2F84, and 2Q8L structures, respectively. However, the smaller buried surfaces for the 2F84 and 2Q8L structures are somewhat compensated by different crystal contacts existing in these structures (which share the same space group and unit cell dimensions), where the tip of the C-terminal helix from a nondimer molecule substitutes for surface normally contributed by the R5-loop (Supporting Information, Figure S1). This crystal contact is absent in the PfODCase-act structure. The PfODCase-rest structures have a phosphate ion at the phosphate binding site, located at the opposite end of the active site with respect to the 5-strand and R5-loop. Although our PfODCase-act structure lacks phosphate, the surrounding residues are identically positioned.

FIGURE 4: Malarial ODCase superposed with enzymes from different species. (a) P. ViVax ODCase (cyan ribbon and sticks, PfODCase numbering, and UMP) is superposed with ODCases from human (pink ribbon and sticks) and B. subtilis (orange ribbon and sticks), each complexed with UMP. The B-chain of the dimer is omitted for clarity. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines. (b) Pyrimidine-binding pocket of PfODCase-act (tan and residue annotation) and human ODCase (pink). The UMP molecule is superposed from a P. ViVax structure. Water molecules resolved in the A- and B-active sites of PfODCase-act are represented by red and yellow transparent spheres. (c) Ribosebinding pocket of PfODCase-act (tan and annotation) and human ODCase (pink and annotation in parentheses). Hydrogen bonds (dashed lines) connect ribose hydroxyls and N104. The water molecule (red transparent sphere) belongs to PfODCase. (d) ODCase from P. horikoshii complexed with either UMP (light-blue ribbon and thin sticks) or XMP (pale-yellow ribbon and thick sticks). Superposed XMP from the B-chain of the dimer is shown as transparent sticks. Hydrogen bonds (dashed lines) via a bridging water (red sphere) connect XMP to N31 (equivalent to N104 in PfODCase).

Dynamic Loops. The other ODCase structures in the PDB do not show the conformational variability in the R5-loop noted for PfODCase. However, conformational variability frequently occurs in the phosphate-binding loop, which constitutes the major difference between ODCase structures (Figure 4a). For example, the Methanobacterium enzyme has a phosphate-binding loop similar to that of the malarial enzyme, which is observed in a closed conformation with UMP (PDB code 1LOQ), but is unresolved with XMP (PDB code 1LOL) or without ligand (PDB code 1DV7). The Pyrococcus enzyme has a similar loop that is closed with UMP (PDB code 2CZE) and closed or open with XMP at the active site (the crystallographically distinct subunits of

the dimer bind XMP differently; PDB code 2CZF). The open conformation for this enzyme, however, is distinct from that observed in the PfODCase structures (not shown). The yeast and human enzymes have much larger phosphatebinding loops, which close over the substrate-binding pocket and make more substantial contact with the dimer partner (Figure 4a, pink ribbon). Of the four human ODCase structures available, one contains UMP (PDB code 2V30), and one contains a glycerol molecule within the active-site cleft (PDB code 2P1F). Although the phosphate-binding loop of the human enzyme is larger than that for PfODCase, its interaction with UMP is similar to that of other ODCases (Figure 4a, pink ribbon and sticks).

(Q430, Q in Figure 4a) projects from the loop to simultaneously hydrogen bond both ends of UMP. The human enzyme also has an additional residue that hydrogen bonds the phosphate group of the substrate (Y432). Structurally analogous residues of PfODCase and human ODCase are illustrated in Figure 5. The yeast and human enzymes have 51% identical amino acid sequences and share the same phosphate-binding loop. Of the two yeast structures available, one contains the potent inhibitor BMP at the active site (PDB code 1DQX), with the pyrimidine base occupying the same position as UMP in the human enzyme and the phosphatebinding loops similarly arranged. In the absence of ligand (PDB code 1DQW), the phosphate-binding loop of the yeast enzyme assumes an open resting or ground-state conformation, which contributes crystal contacts to neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice (Table 3). The E. coli and B. subtilis structures (41% identical amino acid sequences) have a similarly sized, although conformationally distinct, phosphate-binding loop compared to those of the human and yeast structures. This loop similarly projects a glutamine residue that hydrogen bonds both ends of UMP (Figure 4a, orange ribbon and sticks). When the E. coli enzyme is complexed with BMP (PDB code 1EIX), the inhibitor overlays UMP bound in the B. subtilis structure (PDB code 1DBT). The glutamine residue makes similar hydrogen bonds with UMP and BMP. For both bacterial ODCases, an arginine substitutes for the tyrosine ligand to the phosphate noted in the human and yeast structures, absent in the malarial structures. In the absence of ligand, the phosphate-binding loop of the E. coli structure is unresolved (Table 3). EnVironment of the Pyrimidine Ring and Ribose Group. Features conserved between ODCases include the alternating arrangement of charged residues believed to induce decarboxylation (K102, D136, K138, and D141B projecting from the dimer partner, Figure 4b), and residues that sandwich the pyrimidine ring of substrate or product (P264, I142B, and T145B, Figures 4b and 5). A hydrophobic pocket adjacent

to the C6 atom of superposed UMP (defined by residues T163, V240, L262, P264, and nonpolar components of N291 and K102) may temporarily accept CO2 during the catalytic cycle (19). The environment surrounding the ribose group of OMP is conserved except for regions below the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups of the ribose and adjacent to the 3-hydroxyl (Figure 4c). In the malarial and Pyrococcus structures of UMP complexes, the OD1 oxygen of an asparagine residue is positioned to form bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the 2and 3-hydroxyls of the ribose. The analogous residue in the human and yeast structures is histidine (Figures 4c and 5, H283). For the human structures liganded by UMP or glycerol, NE2 of this histidine is modeled to project approximately between the ribose hydroxyls or similarly positioned glycerol hydroxyls. Such a nonideal hydrogenbonding arrangement may in fact reflect the average of sidechain conformations whereby the NE2 nitrogen is directed at one or the other hydroxyl group within the crystal. In contrast, the yeast structure containing BMP is modeled with the CE1 carbon of the analogous histidine (rather than the NE2 nitrogen) directed toward the ribose hydroxyls; no hydrogen bonds as modeled. Scrutiny of this model by the structure validation server, MOLPROBITY (34) suggests that this histidine is modeled incorrectly. In any case, an asparagine residue would be better able to form multiple hydrogen bonds than a histidine at this position. The bacterial enzymes have a glycine at this position, although bifurcated hydrogen bonds to the ribose hydroxyls are contributed by a water molecule. Another difference is that the human/yeast enzymes have an additional serine hydrogen bonding the 3hydroxyl of the ribose (Figures 4c and 5, S257). This residue is replaced by a glycine residue in the malarial structures (G21, or an alanine in most prokaryotic structures), and a water molecule (Figure 4c, red sphere) makes the analogous hydrogen bond. Binding of XMP and Differential Inhibition. For ODCase structures complexed with UMP, AzaUMP, or BMP, the

Malarial OMP Decarboxylase pyrimidine rings slot into the narrow hydrophobic cleft of the active site. Despite its larger size, XMP is a potent competitive inhibitor of ODCase (Table 1). There are only two structures of XMP complexes, the Pyrococcus and Methanobacterium ODCases. In both cases, the purine rings are in the anti-conformation and do not fully enter the cleft normally occupied by a pyrimidine ring. In the Methanobacterium structure, this is due to a molecule of 1,3butanediol residing in the pyrimidine ring pocket. In the Pyrococcus structure, XMP is positioned differently in the A- and B-subunits. In the B-subunit, XMP is positioned as for the Methanobacterium structure, although 4 water molecules reside in the pyrimidine binding pocket. In the A-subunit, the purine ring is more deeply inserted in the pyrimidine cleft and slightly twisted with respect to UMP (Figure 4d). The phosphate-binding loop is disordered in the A-subunit and closed in the B-subunit despite XMP being less deeply inserted. In both active sites, XMP binding is accommodated by an expansion of the cleft (between the subunits), which accepts the aromatic ring (note the movement of helices R2 and R3 and the R5-loop in Figure 4d). The different manner in which Pyrococcus ODCase binds UMP and XMP not only concerns the positions of the aromatic rings and phosphate-binding loop but also extends to the phosphoribosyl group of the ligands (Figure 4d). In both A- and B-subunits, the ribose of XMP is unable to directly hydrogen bond to the asparagine residue as observed for the UMP-complexes of Pyrococcus and malarial ODCases (N104 in Figure 4c). In the XMP-Pyrococcus structure, an alternate rotamer of the asparagine is adopted, which hydrogen bonds the 2-hydroxyl of the ribose via a bridging water molecule (Figure 4d, dashed lines and red sphere). Although the positions of the ribose group of XMP, bridging water, and asparagine are different in the A- and B-subunits, they interact in a similar manner. Last, both subunits of both complexes contain similarly positioned phosphate groups of the UMP and XMP ligands. DISCUSSION PfODCase Characterization and Kinetic Analysis of Inhibitors. Recombinant PfODCase has been analyzed by sizeexclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation and found to be a stable homodimer of 76 kDa in solution, consistent with monomer masses obtained by mass spectrometry and calculated theoretically, and consistent with the crystal structure discussed below. The apparent Km of OMP for recombinant PfODCase (350 ( 60 nM, Table 1) is 0.1fold the value reported for PfODCase purified directly from the parasite (Km  3200 nM) (36) and equivalent to values obtained for the human (Km 295 nM) (37) and yeast (Km  700 nM) (11) enzymes. The Vmax of 2.70 ( 0.10 µmol/ min/mg protein obtained for PfODCase is equivalent to a turnover number of 1.7 s-1, compared with a value of 5 s-1 from our previous work (24) and 15.6 s-1 obtained for ODCase purified directly from P. falciparum (36). The present turnover number of 1.7 s-1 was obtained with a sensitive radioassay to measure true initial reaction velocities from the conversion of only 5% of the OMP to UMP. The latter two values were obtained using a relatively insensitive spectrophotomeric assay that follows the decrease in absorbance at 285 nm. In addition, there may be some minor

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 12, 2008 3851 structural difference between the recombinant PfODCase and the native enzyme. A number of nucleoside 5-monophosphate analogues, including AzaUMP, Pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate, BMP, allopurinol-3-riboside 5-monophosphate, and XMP, have been reported as inhibitors of various ODCases. The Ki value of AzaUMP for human ODCase is 510 nM (38) compared with that of the yeast enzyme (64 nM) (11) and PfODCase determined here (Ki ) 12 ( 3 nM, Table 1). Thus, AzaUMP is an 43-fold more potent inhibitor of PfODCase compared with the human enzyme (Table 1). The Ki value of allopurinol-3-riboside 5-monophosphate for the human erythrocytic ODCase is 2600 nM (37) compared with those of the yeast enzyme (1000 nM) (11) and PfODCase determined here (Ki ) 240 ( 20 nM). Hence, allopurinol-3-riboside 5monophosphate is an 11-fold more potent inhibitor of PfODCase compared with the human enzyme (Table 1). Pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate is a potent inhibitor of yeast ODCase (Ki 5 nM) (39) and P. falciparum determined here (Ki ) 3.6 ( 0.7 nM), with no value available for the human enzyme. Pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate has approximately equivalent inhibitory effects on yeast and malarial ODCases (Table 1). The purine nucleotide XMP inhibits human ODCase (Ki  670 nM) (37), the yeast enzyme (Ki  410 nM) (11), and PfODCase determined here (Ki ) 4.4 ( 0.7 nM). Poduch et al. (40) recently reported a Ki value for XMP of 43 ( 2 nM for the inhibition of PfODCase. Their assay used an isothermal titration calorimeter that would lack the sensitivity of the radioassay used in the present work (Table 1), where true initial reaction velocities were measured. Thus, XMP is an 150-fold more potent inhibitor of PfODCase compared with the human enzyme (Table 1), compared with 43-fold for AzaUMP. In contrast, allopurinol-3-riboside 5monophosphate and Pyrazofurin 5-monophosphate do not show such differential inhibition. Elucidation of the structures of human and malarial ODCase-XMP complexes could provide an explanation of the major difference in inhibition observed for XMP, providing a basis for the development of antimalarial drugs. BMP is also a potent inhibitor of PfODCase (data not shown), as for the human and yeast enzymes (41). However, a detailed kinetic analysis will be required to determine the mechanism of inhibition and a dissociation constant. Structure of Malarial ODCase. Despite performing numerous crystallization trials involving PfODCase with UMP, AzaUMP, or XMP, only a single crystal, grown in the absence of ligand, was obtained. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PDB coordinates recently deposited by the Structural Genomics of Pathogenic Protozoa Consortium (SGPP; http://www.sgpp.org/). The classic TIMbarrel fold of our structure (Figure 3a) differs from this preexisting PfODCase structure in one of its 8 segments: the end of the 5-strand and the adjacent R5-loop (Figure 3a, magenta ribbon, and Figure 3b). On the basis of the positions of residues in this segment, implicated by amino acid and structural homology to be important for catalysis, we propose that our structure represents a more active conformation (PfODCase-act) where the pyrimidine-binding end of the active site pocket is fully formed. In contrast, the more open active site of the pre-existing PfODCase structures (PDB codes 2F84 and 2Q8L) may represent a ground-state or resting conformation (PfODCase-rest). This conclusion is

3852

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 12, 2008

Langley et al. as might be expected for catalysis (Figure 3b). The PfODCase-rest structures were crystallized in a different space group and unit cell to our PfODCase-act structure. The R5loop in these resting- R5-loop structures interacts with the corresponding loop from the dimer partner and with a helix presented by a neighboring (nondimer partner) molecule. These crystal contacts are absent in the PfODCase-act structure (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). The alternate conformations observed for the R5-loop (and phosphate-binding loop) may result solely from different crystal packing environments and be irrelevant to ODCase in solution. However, the frequency with which TIM-barrel enzymes display loop-in/out variability, often affecting active sites, suggests that the conformations of PfODCase observed could indeed represent bona fide intermediates along the reaction pathway between substrate binding and product release (43, 44). As the R5-loop is part of the dimerization interface, structural rearrangement occurring in one subunit is mirrored by the dimer partner, providing a potential mechanism for cooperativity between the active sites. Binding of OMP to one loop-out subunit may induce local loop-in movement, with a conformational change in the other subunit. However, cooperativity with respect to OMP has not been reported for ODCase. In an extensive review of ODCases, Miller and Wolfenden (11) discussed the paradox that although competitive inhibitors of ODCase display a wide range of inhibition constants, they often bind in a near-identical manner. They suggested that ODCases might be capable of active-site rearrangements or conformations yet to be observed crystallographically. Perhaps the R5-loop conformations observed for PfODCase are an example of such dynamics that might be at play in the reaction pathways of all ODCases. Catalytic Mechanism and Differential Inhibition by XMP. The catalytic mechanism of ODCase remains undefined, although numerous mechanisms have been proposed (11). The arrangement of residues that line the active site of the present PfODCase structure is similar to that of other ODCases (PfODCase and human ODCase are juxtaposed in Figure 5). Without structures of human and malarial ODCases complexed with XMP, rationalization of the differential binding of XMP is difficult. Some differences between the active sites include the size and disposition of the phosphatebinding loop and the identities of several amino acids whose side chains are positioned to hydrogen bond with the ribosehydroxyls of UMP or an analogue. Residues N104 and G21 of the malarial structures are replaced by H283 and S257 in the human structure (Figures 4c and 5). More minor differences between human and malarial enzymes include the conservative substitution of several residues of the R5loop (T195 replaced by S372 and N196 replaced by S373), and a methionine residue projecting from the R5-loop (M371) of the human enzyme is replaced by M168B from the B-subunit of the malarial enzyme (Figure 5). The phosphate-binding loop of human ODCase is considerably larger than that for the malarial enzymes and would probably require repositioning to enable XMP to bind in either of the modes observed for the Pyrococcus-XMP structure (Figure 4d). The phosphate-binding loop of the malarial enzymes is the same size and shape as the Pyrococcus loop and may behave similarly, although it is

supported by superposing our structure with those of other Plasmodium species (P. ViVax, P. yoelii, and P. berghei; Figure 3c)3. The structural homology between the activeR5-loop forms of the malarial ODCases is high, particularly at the active site, even though the P. yoelii enzyme contains a bound sulfate ion, the P. berghei enzyme contains an iodide ion, and the structures of the P. ViVax enzyme contain UMP or AzaUMP. An additional difference noted between the malarial ODCases concerns the conformation of the phosphate binding loop: closed for the two P. ViVax and single P. yoelii structures (containing UMP, AzaUMP, or sulfate, respectively) but in open or disordered conformations for the PfODCase structures. The malarial ODCases differ from those of other species by an additional 55 residues in the R1-loop, increased size of the R5-loop (which is dynamic in the case of PfODCase), and variability in the size and conformation of the phosphate-binding loop. Loop Dynamics. The phosphate-binding loop and the R5loop can adopt multiple conformations. The phosphatebinding loop in our PfODCase structure is ordered in the A-subunit and disordered in the B-subunit, probably because of different packing within the crystal lattice. Alternate crystal contacts may indirectly influence the different solvent networks observed in the two active sites despite some of these differentially positioned waters being deep in the active site cleft and out of contact with bulk solvent or the phosphate-binding loop (Figure 4b). An asymmetric distribution of waters also exists in the P. berghei structure. The observation of unique waters in ostensibly identical environments suggests that the displacement of solvent required for the binding of substrate is easily achieved by even the slightest of conformational changes, which no doubt accompany substrate binding. The phosphate-binding loop plays a key role in stabilizing the enzyme-ligand complex. As evident from the many ODCase structures listed in Table 3, this loop is generally observed in a closed conformation over bound product or analogue or is open or disordered in the absence of ligand. An invariant glutamine residue in this loop (Q269 in PfODCase) (35) provides hydrogen bonding to one oxygen on the phosphate and also to the C2 oxygen of the product UMP (14, 20) or of the inhibitors azaUMP (20) and BMP (12, 13) (Figure 5). The fact that Q269 normally binds to two atoms far apart on the nucleotide may account for the inability of bound phosphate or iodide ions alone to close the loop (Table 3). The R5-loop dynamics observed in the PfODCase structures have not been observed for other ODCases. The PfODCase structures have different conformations of this loop, only one of which lines the pyrimidine-binding cleft
3 Our conclusion is also supported by low resolution PfODCase structures published by Tokuoka et al., just prior to the submission of this manuscript (42). PDB codes 2ZA2, 2ZA1, and 2ZA3, all at 2.65 Å resolution and comprising apo, OMP-, and UMP-complexed PfODCase, also have the R5-loop in the active conformation. The apo enzyme has disordered phosphate-binding loops, while in the OMP and UMP complexes, they are closed. The OMP and UMP ligands overlay almost perfectly with the UMP ligand modeled in Figures 3 and 4 of this article. The carboxylate moiety of OMP is accommodated by a subtle rotation of the side chain of D136. In contrast, other finedetail features, such as the expected bifurcated hydrogen-bonding between Q269 and substrate/product, are not apparent in these lower resolution structures.

Malarial OMP Decarboxylase unclear whether the loop would be ordered or disordered in the presence of XMP. Another similarity shared between the malarial and Pyrococcus structures is the presence of an asparagine (N104, Figure 4c) positioned to hydrogen bond the ribose-hydroxyls of the ligand. In the presence of XMP, a different conformation of N104 contacts a differently positioned ribose group via a bridging water molecule. The same alternate rotamer may be used when PfODCase binds XMP. The histidine which substitutes for this residue in the human enzyme might interact with the ribose in a different manner or not at all. Although XMP is shown to bind the Pyrococcus and Methanobacterium enzymes in the anticonformation, considerable rotation about the glycosidic bond is possible for this nucleotide (45) and may account for its ability to differentially inhibit ODCases from disparate organisms. In contrast, UMP, which has the poorest Ki of the inhibitors assayed (Table 1), in solution predominantly adopts the syn-conformation (45), as opposed to the anticonformation observed in the ODCase crystal structures, possibly explaining its weak potency as an ODCase inhibitor. While obtaining crystals of both enzymes complexed with XMP may ultimately explain the differential inhibition by XMP, the human and malarial ODCase structures available provide a starting point for the rational design of more specific PfODCase inhibitors.
