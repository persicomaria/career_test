Abstract The receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a molecular chaperone that binds tightly to certain newly synthesized LDL receptor family members in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and facilitates their delivery to the Golgi. We have adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy to solve the structures of the individual domains of RAP using NMR spectroscopy. We present here the newly determined structure of domain 2. Based on this structure and the structures of domains 1 and 3, which were solved previously, we utilized experimental small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data and a novel simulated annealing protocol to characterize the overall structure of RAP. The results reveal that RAP adopts a unique structural architecture consisting of three independent three-helix bundles that are connected by long and flexible linkers. The flexible linkers and the quasi-repetitive structural architecture may allow RAP to adopt various possible conformations when interacting with the LDL receptors, which are also made of repetitive substructure units.

receptor≠related protein (LRP or LRP1). This receptor family includes the LDL receptor, LRP, LRP1b, gp330/ megalin/LRP2, LRP5, LRP6, the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, and the apoE receptor 2 (Krieger and Herz 1994; Strickland et al. 2002). LRP plays a prominent role in developmental biology, lipoprotein metabolism, and catabolism of proteases involved in matrix remodeling, blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis (Herz and Strickland 2001). It binds and mediates the endocytosis of a wide variety of ligands, which include a2-macroglobulin≠protease complexes (a2M), tissue-type plasminogen activators, urokinase plasminogen activators, and toxins such as Pseudomonas exotoxin A (Sarti

et al. 2000; Strickland et al. 2002). LRP also plays important roles in maintaining the integrity of vessel walls (Boucher et al. 2003), the blood≠brain barrier (Yepes et al. 2003), and in the clearance of apoptotic cells by mediating their phagocytosis (Gardai et al. 2005). The effective delivery of LRP to the cell surface requires RAP, and the amount of functional LRP is significantly reduced in the liver and brain of RAP-deficient mice (Willnow et al. 1995). As a molecular chaperone and/or escort protein for the LDL receptor family, RAP prevents the premature interaction between members of this receptor family and their ligands in the ER, thereby preventing them from being degraded in lysosomes and facilitating their delivery to the cell surface (Willnow et al. 1995, 1996; Hsieh et al. 2003). RAP is a modular protein that contains three domains: D1, D2, and D3 (Bu et al. 1995; Lazic et al. 2003), which are thought to have distinct functions (Obermoeller et al. 1997). The carboxyl-terminal domain (D3) of RAP is required for folding and trafficking of LRP, whereas the amino-terminal tandem D1D2 domains of RAP are required for blocking the binding of certain ligands, such as activated forms of a2-macroglobulin, to LRP (Obermoeller et al. 1997). RAP associates with LRP early in the secretory pathway, reducing its ligand-binding capacity, and then dissociates from LRP in the lower pH encountered in the Golgi (Bu et al. 1995). Our recent studies demonstrate that histidine residues serve as a switch in RAP D3 that facilitates its uncoupling from the receptor in the low-pH environment of the Golgi (Lee et al. 2006a). Insight into the function of RAP and its mode of interaction with LRP requires the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of this protein. To date, the structures of two of the three individual domains in RAP have been reported (Nielsen et al. 1997; Wu et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2006a). Here we present the structure of D2, which, along with the structures of D1 and D3, allows us to determine the overall structure of full-length RAP based on small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data. Results Structure determination of D2 and mechanism of D1D2 binding to LRP Based on nearly complete 1H/13C/15N signal assignments of D2 (residues 100≠216), we assigned more than 1400 sequential, short-, medium-, and long-range NOEs. We then used these NOEs as distance restraints, together with 154 dihedral-angle restraints from the secondary chemical-shift index (Wishart and Sykes 1994; Wishart and Nip 1998), 155 residue dipolar couplings (RDCs), 65 hydrogen-bond restraints, and 158 secondary chemical-shift restraints to

calculate the structure of D2. A summary of the secondary structure diagram and restraints are summarized in Figure S1 of the Supplemental material. On average, there are ;16 restraints per residue (Table 1). The RDCs of the protein provide important global restraints that complement the short-range NOE and torsion-angle restraints. The RMSD values of the mean structure relative to the 20 lowestenergy conformers for the regular secondary structure ∞ region are 0.22 A for the polypeptide backbone and 0.94 ∞ for all heavy atoms (Fig. 1). The quality of the structure A determination is also manifest from the PROCHECK program (Laskowski et al. 1993), which shows that the f and c angles of D2 are 67% in the most favorable, 22% in

the allowable, 8% in the generously allowable, and 3% in the disallowed regions of the f,c-plane. The solution structure of D2 is composed of three a-helices consisting of the residues 117≠127 (a4), 132≠ 161 (a5), and 184≠208 (a6) (the a-helices are numbered in the context of the full-length RAP). The N-terminal peptide segment of residues 101≠116 is flexible and disordered. The linker between a4 and a5 is well-defined, whereas the linker between a5 and a6 is 23 amino acids long and is disordered (see the heteronuclear NOE data in a later section) and susceptible to protease digestion (Rall et al. 1998). A search using the program MOLMOL with generous criteria confirmed that there is no salt bridge in the structure. As in D1 and D3 of RAP (Wu et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2006a), hydrophobic interactions within the core of the D2 structure appear to be important in stabilizing this three-helical bundle. Consequently, the relative arrangement of the three helices is determined primarily by a number of hydrophobic contacts involving the side chains of residues L117, L120, W121, and A124 in a4; L135, L138, W139, F142, V149, Y152, L156, and L159 in a5; and L183, I197, L201, L204, and V207 in a6. In addition, the individual helices are further stabilized by regular hydrogen bonds, as indicated by the presence of the medium-range NOE connectivities. In addition to the ability of D3 of RAP to bind to LRP with high affinity, tandem domains D1D2 contain a highaffinity binding site for LRP (Medved et al. 1999). Com1630

petitive binding experiments reveal that D1 and D2 each bind weakly to LRP, but the tandem D1D2 binds much more tightly to LRP (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that the high-affinity binding of D1D2 to LRP results from avidity effects arising from amino acid residues contributed from each domain. The determined D2 structure, along with the structure of D1, makes possible the identification of those residues critical for binding to LRP. Prior work recognized that basic residues in both D2 and D3 are important for the binding of RAP to both LRP and heparin (Melman et al. 2001). For example, Migliorini et al. (2003) showed that K256 and K270 are both essential for the binding of D3 to LRP, while Melman et al. (2001) demonstrated that mutation of the basic cluster R203LR205R206 located in D2, along with R282VSR285SR287EK289 located in D3, resulted in a loss of affinity of RAP for LRP (Melman et al. 2001), implicating some of these residues in the binding interaction. However, the mutation of either cluster alone had little effect on the binding of RAP to LRP. In agreement with the studies of Melman et al. (2001), our data show that the mutation of R203LR205R206 had little effect on the binding of D1D2 to LRP (Supplemental material Fig. S2). However, we identified basic residues within D2, represented by K191 and R195, which we suspected may contribute to the binding of this domain to LRP, as the side chains of K191 and R195 are almost totally surface exposed and prominently protrude from the surface

whether RAP uses a histidine switch in D3 and/or in D2 to mediate the interaction with ERD2 when being returned from the Golgi to the ER is not known. The three RAP domains are independent and do not interact A previous study suggested that RAP folds into a globular protein (Rall et al. 1998). The newly determined solution structure of D2, together with previously determined structures of D1 and D3, makes it feasible to delineate the structure of full-length RAP. To derive the structure of full-length RAP from the individual structures of the three domains, we needed to determine first, whether the structures of the individual domains of RAP are faithful representations of those in full-length RAP, and second, whether any domain-to-domain interaction occurs in fulllength RAP. Moreover, the answers to these questions will provide some structural insights into possible cooperativity among domains and unique functions of individual domains. To answer these questions, we systematically compared the chemical shifts of the backbone amide groups of the individual domain constructs with those of intact RAP using a combination of 2D-[15N,1H]-TROSY, 3D-TROSYHNCA spectra. Figure 4, A and B, shows the 2D-[15N,1H]TROSY spectrum of full-length RAP and the superimposed spectra of the three domains, respectively. The spectra indicate that the distribution patterns of amide cross-peaks in the resolved regions in Figure 4, A and B, are almost identical.

Figure 2. D1 and D2 compete for the binding of 125I-labeled D1D2 to LRP. LRP was immobilized in microtiter wells, and incubated with 125Ilabled D1D2 in the presence of indicated concentrations of unlabeled D1D2 (closed down-facing triangles), D1 (closed circles), or D2 (open circles). Error bars were derived from duplicated sets of the experiments.

(Supplemental material Fig. S3). Further, we found residues R76 and R79 are in D1 at a similar position (Supplemental material Fig. S3). Thus, we examined the contribution of these residues to the binding interaction using mutational analysis. The conversion of R76 and R79 to alanine resulted in a twofold decrease in affinity of D1D2 for LRP, while conversion of K191 and R195 to alanine resulted in a ninefold decrease in affinity. The combined mutations (K77A/R80A and K191A/R195A) generated a D1D2 molecule with a nearly 40-fold decrease in affinity (Fig. 3). Together, these binding studies confirm that basic residues on D1 and D2 contribute to the binding of these RAP domains to the negatively charged surface of LRP, possibly caused by the direct interaction of the basic residues in D1 and D2 with acidic pockets in LRP in a mode similar to those observed for D3 (Fisher et al. 2006). RAP serves as an escort chaperone and an antagonist of ligand binding when it associates with LRP. It dissociates from the receptor via a histidine switch in D3 in responding to the acidic pH environment in the Golgi (Lee et al. 2006b). Interestingly, there are eight histidines in D2 of human RAP, and the electrostatic potential surface of D2 changes dramatically when RAP travels from the ER to the Golgi (Supplemental material Fig. S4). However, mutating all conserved histidines in D2 to alanines does not alter the pH sensitivity of RAP's binding to LRP (Lee et al. 2006b). We note that in cells, RAP is retrieved from the Golgi and returned to the ER by ERD2, a receptor that recognizes a tetrapeptide sequence located at the carboxy terminus of RAP and binds to RAP in the acidic environment of the Golgi (Obermoeller et al. 1997). While RAP's release from LRP has been demonstrated to be mediated by a histidine switch in D3,

Comparison of [15N,1H]-TROSY spectra of uniformly 15N,2H,13C-labeled full-length RAP (A) or individual domains superimposed and color coded (magenta for D1, cyan for D2, and blue for D3) (B). Domain construct boundaries are D1 (residues 1≠100); D2 (residues 101≠216); and D3 (residues 206≠323). The [15N,1H]-TROSY spectra were measured with different numbers of scans, and polarization transfer times were optimized (2.7 ms for domain constructs and 2.2 ms for the full-length RAP) for a maximum signal-to-noise ratio for amino groups. The spectrum of full-length RAP was plotted at a low contour level to show as many peaks as possible, including very weak ones, for comparing patterns in the spectra. The comparison shows that the chemical-shift changes between the individual domains and the full-length RAP are insignificant except for the residues in the ends of the domains. The constructs of D2 and D3 have a sequence overlap (residues 206≠216). (C, D, E) Amide proton (DdH), 15 N (DdN), and the combined (Ddav) chemical-shift difference between the full-length RAP and its individual domains, respectively. The combined chemical-shift difference was calculated using the formula Ddav º 0.5[DdH2 + (0.2DdN)2]0.5 (Pellecchia et al. 1999). The schematic drawing on the top of panel C is the secondary structure of RAP, with boxes and lines representing a-helices and linkers between helices, respectively. For the overlapped peaks, the chemical-shift positions were taken from HNCA spectra, where ;65% of the amide peaks of the full-length RAP are resolved. All spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600 MHz under the same conditions (ca. 1.0 mM-labeled proteins in 95% H2O/5% 2H2O, pH 7.25, 30∞C).

Mapping the chemical-shift difference throughout the protein was performed using 3D-TROSY-HNCA (Supplemental material Fig. S5) spectra of the individual domains and full-length RAP to partially resolve extensive overlapping (see Fig. 4C≠E). The chemical-shift differences between the individual domains and those in full-length RAP are <0.05 ppm, except in the linker regions, where domain constructs break off. This finding suggests that the structures of the individual domains are preserved and there is no detectable chemical-shift perturbation due to domainto-domain interaction. The same comparison was also made between the tandem domains (D12, residues 1≠216; and D23, residues 106≠323), and the results are shown in Figure 5. Lazic et al. (2003) have suggested that interdomain interactions may occur between D2 and D3 based on the change in appearance of the heteronuclear singlequantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of D23 by comparing with the spectra of their individual domains. Their spectrum of the tandem D23 construct has a hallmark of unfolding (congested cross peaks centered ;8.2 ppm in amide proton frequency) and aggregation (line broadening and decreased sensitivity). We have tested arrays of solution conditions in the process of optimization. We 1632

have noticed that D3 was marginally stable under 50 mM NaCl without 75 mM NaPi and the construct D23 aggregated under 50 mM NaCl. D3 is the least stable among the three domains (Lazic et al. 2003). High-quality spectra of the domains and the tandem domain constructs can only be obtained with the solution condition that we have described in this paper. To further determine if interdomain interaction occurs, we titrated a nonlabeled D3 up to a fivefold excess into a 0.2 mM 15N-labeled, perdeuterated D2 sample and monitored the spectral changes in [15N,1H]-HSQC. The acquired spectra showed virtually no change. This result, together with the finding that chemical shifts are nearly identical in the domains, whether they are isolated domain constructs, tandem domain constructs, or the full-length protein, led us to conclude that no detectable interaction occurs among these individual domains. Thus, the individual domain structures are faithful representations of their structure in the full-length protein. These results are in agreement with a previous study using fluorescence emission spectra where the sum spectra of the individual domains is well matched by that of the intact RAP when the protein concentrations were kept at much lower concentrations (Lazic

ping data; and (2) that the linkers connecting the domains are flexible and disordered (Fig. 6). Since no interdomain interaction was detected and the linkers between the domains are flexible and disordered, we conclude that there is no fixed relative orientation among the domains. The flexibility of the linkers allows the three RAP domains to adopt a broad range of possible orientations relative to each other. Domain boundary Since several domain boundaries of RAP have been proposed (Bu et al. 1995; Rall et al. 1998; Medved et al. 1999), we are interested in determining the domain boundary based on the structure of the full-length RAP. Based on the three-dimensional structure of RAP, together with previous boundary proposals and the sequence alignment among vertebrates (Supplemental material Fig. S6), we suggest that the boundaries of individual domains are as follows: D1, residues 1≠106; D2, residues 107≠213; and D3, residues 214≠323. The linkers between the adjacent domains fall within the regions where the sequences are less conserved (Supplemental material Fig. S6): D1 ends at G106 (the beginning of the gap in the region with no conserved residues), while D2 may end anywhere between residues S213 and A221, where no residue is conserved among the species. In addition, the long, flexible loop between a5 and a6 in D2 is accessible to proteases (Supplemental material Fig. S6), a condition that is in agreement with a four-domain model of RAP that was previously proposed on the basis of proteolysis studies (Medved et al. 1999). In addition, the boundaries

At the top, the regular secondary structure elements of the full-length RAP are indicated schematically.

et al. 2003). Furthermore, there appears no functional basis for D3 to be interacting with D2 (see Discussion). Interdomain linkers of RAP are flexible and disordered To determine whether the linkers between the domains in full-length RAP have a fixed conformation, we employed heteronuclear 15N-{1H} NOE experiments and measured the 15N-{1H} NOE of individual domains, tandem domains, and full-length RAP. The results (Fig. 4), reveal (1) that the domains, the tandem domains, and the fulllength protein share similar 15N-{1H} NOE patterns, implying that the structural integrity of the domains is maintained, in agreement with the chemical-shift map-

of D3 are perfectly aligned with the boundaries of its encoded three exons, i.e., exons 6, 7, and 8 (Supplemental material Fig. S6). Overall structure of RAP based on SANS data Since RAP consists of three independent domains joined by two flexible linkers, the protein is expected to have an ensemble of conformers in solution. SANS data contains information about the overall shape of proteins in solution (Glinka et al. 1998) and, therefore, can be useful in restraining the structures. A similar approach using smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data to directly refine NMR structures has been reported (Grishaev et al. 2005). We have implemented a protocol to refine the three domains of RAP using both SANS and NMR data. To assess the agreement of the calculated structures with the SANS data, x2 values were calculated for the top 20 structures using the expressions Ijobs and Icalc: j x º N I ¿ 1ﬁ¿1 + I obs =I obs ¿ I calc =I calc ﬁ2 =s2 qj ﬁ j 0 j 0 I

In this calculation, NI represents the total number of data points; Ijobs and Icalc are, respectively, the observed and j calculated scattering intensities at q º qj; and sI(qj) is the associated experimental error. The resulting 20 values took the value x2 º 7.83 6 0.82, to be compared with a value of 34.93 for the radius of gyration (Rg)-refined starting structure. The experimental and the back-calculated SANS curves based on the Rg-refined and the SANS-refined structures are shown in Figure 7. Because of the restriction of Rg during the SA calculation, the three domains are evenly, but artificially, distributed around the center of mass in order to satisfy the dimensionality imposed by the Rg without considering the overall shape of the molecule. Consequently, the back-calculated SANS curves based on the Rg-refined structure do not fit the experimental SANS data, except in the initial part of the curve (Guinier region). In comparison, the back-calculated curves based on individual SANS-refined structures are tightly bunched and match the experimental data much more closely than those calculated from the Rg-refined structure, suggesting an improved agreement between the overall shape of the SANS-refined structures and that of the protein in solution. Nevertheless, the curves of the SANS-refined structures deviate from the observed curve for q values larger than ∞ ;0.12 A¿1, suggesting that the experimental SANS curve does not agree with any single structure, and is most likely a reflection of an ensemble of conformers that may include more extended structures co-existing in solution. We are currently developing a protocol that allows simultaneous calculation of multiple conformers whose average SANS is 1634

subject to restraint of the experimental SANS and the NMR data in a simulated annealing. Figure 8 shows the backbones of the 20 lowest-energy SANS-refined structures (Fig. 8A) and the ribbon diagrams of the Rg-refined (Fig. 8D) and two representative SANS-refined structures (Fig. 8B,C). Even though the helix bundle or repetitive domain architecture is common in protein structures, the structure of RAP is unique in that it is organized with the three threehelical bundles as its repetitive domains. Our structure of the full-length protein agrees with the predicted ``triplicated repeats'' on the basis of a sequence analysis of the RAP amino acid sequence (Bu et al. 1995). The structural organization of independent repetitive three-helical bundles such as RAP cannot be found using the search program DALI (Holm and Sander 1993). The elongated structure and repetitive nature of RAP appear to be designed for interaction with repetitive binding substrates, such as the LRP receptors, and may allow for binding at multiple sites (Obermoeller et al. 1997; Rudenko et al. 2002). It has been suggested that RAP may exist in an extended conformation (Lazic et al. 2003). Our structure predicts that RAP would ∞ be over 150 A long if the linkers were in a fully extended conformation. Discussion RAP is a versatile ER resident protein that antagonizes the bindings of all known ligands to members of the LDL receptor protein family. The structure of individual domains and the overall architecture of the full-length molecule provide insights into RAP's functions. The individual

domains and domain combinations of RAP are known to have their own specificities toward LRP and other molecules, such as heparin (Munson and Rodbard 1980; Bu et al. 1995), and they exhibit differential functions. RAP contains two independent LRP-binding sites, one located within D1D2 and the other in D3 (Migliorini et al. 2003). The tandem domains D1D2 bind to the second and the fourth ligand-binding clusters present on LRP, whereas D3 binds to all three ligand-binding clusters on LRP. Furthermore, RAP has regions that interact weakly with heparin, one located in D2 and two located in D3 (Melman et al. 2001). Fisher and colleagues (Fisher et al. 2006) have recently reported a co-crystal structure of a complex between a two-module region of the ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor and D3 of RAP. The structure revealed the nature of the interaction between the RAP D3 domain and the ligand-binding repeats of the LDL receptor: Two protruding lysines in the second helix, K256 and K270, dock separately to two almost identical calcium-coordinated acidic pockets on the two ligand-binding repeats. This result is in agreement with previous biochemical studies, suggesting that the basic residues at the two sites in RAP are responsible for the recognition of this domain of RAP by LRP (Migliorini et al. 2003). It should be highlighted that the binding of D3 to two ligand-binding repeats from LRP occurs with a relatively weak affinity (Lazic et al. 2006). This finding suggests that D3 interacts with three tandem repeats of LRP for optimal binding, a notion that is consistent with the findings of Vash et al. (1998), who found that three ligand-binding repeats in LRP were optimal for RAP binding. This implies that a third lysine residue in D3 is also critical for the interaction of D3 with LRP. The mechanism by which the tandem domain D12 binds to LRP is likely to be different from that involving D3, as neither D1 nor D2 have two protruding binding handles that fit into the two acidic binding pockets in the tandem ligand-binding repeats. Thus, D1 and D2 bind to LRP with a weak affinity (Fig. 2), which is distinct from D3 which binds to LRP with high affinity. Together, however, the tandem domain D12 possesses a highaffinity binding to LRP (Obermoeller et al. 1997; Migliorini et al. 2003). These data suggest an avidity effect, in which lysine residues from each domain contribute to the binding very likely by interacting with individual ligand-binding repeats on LRP to produce high-affinity binding. Our study identified basic residues in D1 (K77/R80) and D2 (K191/R195) that appear to constitute a portion of the LRP-binding site, as mutations of these basic residues to alanines generated a D1D2 molecule with a nearly 40fold decrease in affinity for LRP (Fig. 3). This result implies that simultaneous binding of both domains to LRP is required for the high affinity to LRP. Another 1636

study (Jensen et al. 2006) demonstrated that the mutation of Lys60 to alanine reduced the affinity of D1 for two ligand-binding repeats of LRP (CR56), revealing that this lysine also contributes to the binding interaction. The flexibility in linkers connecting the three domains of RAP appears to be encoded for maximum functional versatility of RAP. D1 and D2 act together as an antagonist to block a2-macroglobulin interactions with LRP, and the flexible, long linker between D1 and D2 may allow maximum freedom for both domains to adopt the conformations necessary for simultaneous binding to LRP. Furthermore, the flexible linker between D2 and D3 adds a minimum conformation constraint to D3, which itself appears to embody many functions of RAP. RAP D3 acts as a chaperone and an escort, both of which are important for the maturation of LRP (Obermoeller et al. 1997). The escorting activity of D3 is attributed to the histidine switch, which responds to the pH change from the ER to the Golgi (Lee et al. 2006a); D3 is able to function independently, without the presence of the other two domains. In summary, the solution structure of RAP has been deduced by a divide-and-conquer strategy, in which the structure of each domain was individually solved by NMR measurements. A novel protocol using SANS measurements was then employed to refine the overall structure of the molecule. This analysis revealed that RAP contains three independent domains, each constructed of a three-helical bundle, which are linked by highly flexible linkers. The ability of RAP to interact with high affinity with the repetitive structures on LDL receptor family members is very likely the result of the flexibility of the linker regions, which enables multiple conformational orientations of the individual domains of this molecular chaperone. Materials and Methods Sample preparation
The wild-type RAP and its domain constructs were cloned and over-expressed as described earlier (Medved et al. 1999), replacing the GST fusion protein with a histidine tag. The proteins were purified using a 20-mL Cobalt column (TALON Superflow, BD Biosciences Clontech), followed by a semipreparative C-18 reverse-phase column (Vydac). The elutions containing the proteins were lyophilized and then dialyzed with NMR sample buffer (75 mM NaPi, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.25) using 3-k MWCO Millipore spin filters. The resulting samples were used for the structure determination. Isotope labeling of the proteins was described previously (Wang et al. 1996). The constructs of D2 and D3 have a sequence overlap (residues 206≠216).

Residual dipolar coupling
Pf1 was used as an alignment medium. The protein did not interact with the alignment medium as judged by comparing

Multidomain protein; receptor associated protein

[15N,1H]-HSQC spectra collected with and without the medium. In preparation of Pf1-anisotropic D2 solution, a Pf1 stock solution of 50 mg/mL was filtered extensively with the buffer (50 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaPi, pH 7.25) using a 100-k MWCO spin filter. The volume of the protein-Pf1 solution was adjusted to give a splitting ;13 Hz of the deuterium signal and a concentration of ;13 mg Pf1/mL measured with a UV spectrophotometer at 270 nm (Hansen et al. 1998). 1DNH, 1DCaC9, and 1DCaHa were taken as the difference in J splittings measured in isotropic and anisotropic samples from 2D 15N HSQC-IPAP, 3D HNCO≠ JCOCA, and 3D HN(CO)CA≠JCAHA, respectively (Bax et al. 2001). In processing the data, indirectly detected dimensions were predicted linearly. We used a combination of simulated annealing refinement and a grid search (Clore et al. 1998a), as well as the histogram (powder pattern) of 1DNH and normalized 1DCaC9 and 1 DCaHa (Clore and Kuszewski 1998b), to extract the axial and rhombic components, Da and R, respectively, of the alignment tensor.

elsewhere (Migliorini et al. 2003). The KD value we measured under these conditions was 1.9 nM.

Chemical-shift mapping
The amide group assignments for domain constructs have been reported elsewhere (Wu et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2006b; Walsh et al. 2006). Partial amide group assignments of the tandem domains D1D2 and D2D3 and full-length RAP were made based on the peak position matching in (1) 2D TROSY 15 N-HSQC and (2) 3D TROSY HNCA spectra of the individual domain, tandem domain, and full-length RAP constructs. To illustrate this, we show two figures containing the matching planes of 3D TROSY HNCA spectra of full-length RAP and the D2D3 tandem domain at v1 (15N) º 120.5 ppm, where there are extensive overlaps in the 2D TROSY HSQC (Figs. 4, 5).

Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements Structure determination
3D 13C-, 3D 15N-, 3D 13C/15N-, and 4D 13C/15N-edited NOESY spectra with mixing times of 100 ms were used to obtain distance restraints. In addition, a 3D HNHA spectrum was recorded to extract JHNHA couplings. Distance calibration of the interproton distance restraints was performed using a previously reported protocol (Garrett et al. 1997; Bewley and Clore 2000). Torsion-angle restraints were derived using a combination of CSI, quantitative analysis of JHNHA couplings (Vuister and Bax 1994), and the TALOS program (Cornilescu et al. 1999). Two restraints for each hydrogen bond (NH≠O º 1.5≠ ∞ ∞ 2.8 A and N≠O º 2.4≠3.5 A) were derived from NH exchange experiments, backbone NOE patterns, and backbone 13Ca/13Cb chemical shifts. The hydrogen-bond restraints were applied in the later stage of the structure calculation. The backbone 13Ca/ 13 Cb chemical shifts were also used directly in the structure calculation. Tight turns clearly identified by NOE patterns and J coupling constants were restrained to their standard values with a 630∞ error range. We calculated the structure of D2 using simulated annealing in torsion-angle space (Stein et al. 1997; Schwieters and Clore 2001; Schwieters et al. 2003), starting from an extended strand, followed by simulated annealing in Cartesian space using XPLOR-NIH (Schwieters et al. 2003), which contains pseudopotentials for residual dipolar couplings, a conformational database, and chemical-shift refinement module (Clore and Kuszewski 2002). Molecular models were generated with MOLMOL (Koradi et al. 1996). The solution structure of D2 has been deposited in the PDB bank with accession code 2GPG. The SANS of RAP was measured in NMR sample buffer and performed on the 30-m SANS instruments at the NIST Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, MD (Glinka et al. 1998). Samples were measured in 1-mm path-length quartz cuvettes at 20∞C at nominal concentrations of 5 and 3 mg/mL in H2O buffer and at 5, 3, and 1 mg/mL in D2O buffer. The neutron wave∞ length, l, was 5 A, with a wavelength spread, Dl/l, of 0.15. Scattered neutrons were detected with a 64 cm 3 64 cm, 2D position-sensitive detector with 128 3 128 pixels at a resolution of 0.5 cm/pixel. Raw counts were normalized to a common monitor count and corrected for empty cell counts, ambient room background counts, and nonuniform detector response. Data were placed on an absolute scale by normalizing the scattered intensity to the incident beam flux. Finally, the data were radially averaged to produce scattered intensity, I(q), vs. q curves, where q is the momentum transfer, defined as q º 4p sin(u)/l and 2u is the scattering angle. Sample-to-detector distances of 6.0 and 1.5 m were used in order to cover the range ∞ ∞ 0.01 A¿1 # q # 0.35 A¿1. The scattered intensities from the samples were then further corrected for buffer scattering and incoherent scattering from hydrogen in the samples. The Rg was obtained at both sample concentrations by using the Guinier approximation, I(q) % I(0) exp(¿q2Rg2/3), where I(0) is the scattered intensity at q º 0 (Guinier and Fournet 1955). A plot of ln(I) vs. q2 should contain a linear region with slope Rg2/3 and intercept ln[I(0)]. The range of validity for the Guinier analysis depends on the shape of the particle. However, Guinier fits are generally made in a q range centered about the relation, qRg % 1.0. Guinier fits to the RAP data at each concentration were made in several different q ranges between ∞ ∞ q º 0.012 A¿1 and q º 0.044 A¿1. The results were averaged in order to obtain a single value for Rg in each case. This resulted ∞ in Rg values of 34 6 1 A for the 5 and 3 mg/mL samples in H2O ∞ buffer and 36.0 6 0.05, 35.5 6 0.5, and 36 6 1 A for the 5, 3, and 1 mg/mL samples in D2O buffer, respectively. There is evidence of slightly larger sizes in the samples in D2O buffer, with the effect mainly on the portion of the SANS curve below ∞ q º 0.02 A¿1. Thus, the Rg values for the samples in D2O buffer are slightly larger than those for the samples in H2O buffer. It is unclear whether these differences indicate some aggregation of the samples in D2O buffer or whether they indicate a difference in the positions of the flexible linkers in these samples. The ∞ average Rg value for all of the samples is 35 6 1 A, which is the value that was used in the Rg-refined NMR structure.

RAP≠LRP binding assays
Solid-phase competition experiments were performed as described using 125I-labeled proteins (Migliorini et al. 2003). Nonspecific binding was measured by including a 50-fold excess of unlabeled D1D2 or mutants. Data were analyzed using LIGAND (Munson and Rodbard 1980), and the fitted curves are plotted along with the experimental data points in Figures 2, 3, and Supplemental material Figure S2. We have performed a binding assay measuring the binding of RAP to LRP at the NMR solution condition (75 mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.25) and found no difference between these conditions and the conditions detailed

Simulated annealing refinement using NMR and SANS data
Grishaev and colleagues were the first to utilize SAXS data to restrain structures using the simulated annealing protocol (Grishaev et al. 2005). While the SANS and SAXS methods differ in their equipment and scattering sources and each method has its own advantages, the interpretation of the scattering intensity vs. the transfer momentum is virtually the same. We implemented the simulated annealing restrained with the SANS and NMR data in the XPLOR-NIH package (Schwieters et al. 2003). Refinement against SANS data was performed using the surface grid approach, as described in (Schwieters and Clore 2007). Two stages of atom globbing were used. For final plotting and calculation, only hydrogen atoms were globbed onto their neighboring heavy atom. During refinement, more extensive globbing of heavy atoms was used (Grishaev et al. 2005). In this work, a surface grid size of 120 points was utilized. Excluded solvent effects were included in the SANS calculations, and exchangeable protons were deuterated at the 90% level by scaling their scattering lengths. Atomic neutron scattering lengths were taken from references (Jacob 1976; Cantor and Schimmel 1980). Only the D2O SANS data at 5 mg/mL concentration were used for refinement. These data were preprocessed with the GNOM software package (Semenyuk and Svergun 1991), with ∞ the assumption of no smearing, an rmax value of 120 A, and P(rmin) º P(rmax) º 0. The resulting scattering curve I(q) and the associated experimental deviation sI(q) were subsampled at 20 values of q using cubic spline interpolation. The resulting curve deviated from the experimental curve at the smallest five values of the experimental I(q); the experimental curve takes larger values of I(q) than the smoothed GNOM-derived curve. ∞ The GNOM-determined Rg was 38.0 A with I0 º 0.187, while ∞ a Guinier fit yielded Rg º 39.0 A and I0 º 0.193. This Guinier Rg value represents a single fit to the data and is thus different than the Rg value quoted above, which is an average value based on several different fits to the data in the Guinier region. The GNOM-derived Rg value is dependent on the value chosen ∞ for rmax. For instance, if rmax º 110 A, then GNOM-determined ∞ , which agrees well with the Guinier value quoted Rg is 36.5 A above for the same sample. A harmonic energy potential was used for refinement against solution-phase scattering intensity Escat º vscat + vj ΩIqj ﬁ ¿ I obs qj ﬁ2

variable module (IVM) of XPLOR-NIH (Schwieters and Clore 2001), employing its variable step-size feature. The structuredetermination protocol consisted of 20 ps of dynamics at 3000∞K followed by annealing from 3000∞K to 25∞K at 12.5∞K increments, with 0.4 ps of dynamics run at each temperature. Final gradient minimization was performed in torsion-angle space, followed by all-degrees-of-freedom minimization. The 10 lowest-energy (omitting TADB and nonbonded terms) structures were used for analysis. Atomic masses were set to 100 amu. The structure refined with the Rg restraint was used as a starting structure, as this structure was well-defined in regions containing dense quantities of NOE and other restraints. Force constants on the various energy terms were either scaled geometrically during refinement or held constant. The values used in refinement are listed in Table 2. Of the 200 computed structures, 20 that had the best fit to the experimental SANS curve were chosen. The coordinates of ensemble of the fulllength RAP calculated with the Rg or SANS restraints have been deposited in the PDB bank with accession codes 3P01 and 3P03, respectively.
