In this article, we report the total chemical synthesis of human lysozyme. Lysozyme serves as a widespread model system in various fields of biochemical research, including protein folding, enzyme catalysis, and amyloidogenesis. The 130-aa wild-type polypeptide chain of the human enzyme was assembled from four polypeptide segments by using native chemical ligation in a fully convergent fashion. Key to the assembly strategy is the application of the recently developed kinetically controlled ligation methodology, which provides efficient control over the ligation of two peptide thioesters to yield a unique product. This result enables the facile preparation of a 64-residue peptide thioester; this segment is joined by native chemical ligation to a 66-aa Cys peptide, to yield the target 130-aa polypeptide chain. The synthetic polypeptide chain was folded in vitro into a defined tertiary structure with concomitant formation of four disulfides, as shown by 2D TOCSY NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the synthetic human lysozyme was confirmed by high-resolution x-ray diffraction, giving the highest-resolution structure (1.04 Å) observed to date for this enzyme. Synthetic lysozyme was obtained in good yield and excellent purity and had full enzymatic activity. This facile and efficient convergent synthesis scheme will enable preparation of unique chemical analogs of the lysozyme molecule and will prove useful in numerous areas of lysozyme research in the future.

ysozyme is possibly one of the best studied enzymes. The x-ray structure of hen egg-white lysozyme, initially reported in 1965, was the first high-resolution 3D structure of an enzyme molecule (1). Since then the protein has served as a model system for the study of protein folding and misfolding, enzyme catalysis and mechanism, x-ray crystallography, enzyme evolution, and protein engineering (2­9). Moreover, human lysozyme recently has attracted considerable interest because certain mutations in the enzyme were shown to render the protein amyloidogenic (10, 11). Despite extensive genetic, structural, and physico-chemical studies carried out over the last 50 years, many questions regarding lysozyme folding, catalysis, and amyloid fibril formation remain unsolved, unsatisfactorily explained, or controversial. This deficit is at least in part attributable to the limited means that could be used to modify the chemical structure of the lysozyme molecule. More powerful and versatile control over the structure of the enzyme is required for a detailed understanding of the properties of the protein on the molecular or atomic scale. Chemical protein synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool in this respect, especially because it grants nearly absolute control over the covalent structure of an enzyme molecule (12­14). Given the widespread and longlasting interest in lysozyme research, it is not surprising that for exactly these reasons chemical synthesis of the full-length protein has been envisioned (and attempted) as early as the 1970s (15, 16). However, these early experiments were unsuccessful, and despite significant progress made in the field, robust chemical access to the 130-aa family of lysozyme proteins has not been established so far. Modern approaches to the chemical synthesis of proteins involve the synthesis by stepwise solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of

relatively small ( 50-residue) peptide segments, which span the entire sequence of the polypeptide chain of the protein. These unprotected segments then are linked by chemical ligation reactions to give the full-length polypeptide, which then is folded in vitro to form the active protein. Critical to this synthetic strategy was the development of chemical ligation approaches, which made possible the chemoselective linking of unprotected peptide segments in good yield (17). Native chemical ligation (NCL) (18) is the most successful chemoselective reaction developed so far and has enabled the synthesis of a number of proteins, which often were equipped with nonnative features (such as biophysical probes, backbone modifications, D-amino acid residues, or glycan mimetics) to address specific experimental questions (19­22). NCL involves the reaction of an unprotected peptide thioester with another unprotected peptide carrying an N-terminal cysteine. Initial reversible transthioesterification between the sulfhydryl group of the Nterminal cysteine and the peptide thioester gives a thioester-linked intermediate, which spontaneously rearranges in a rapid second step to form a native peptide bond (18). Most proteins synthesized so far by NCL have been constructed from merely two peptide segments, thus limiting chemical access to target proteins of 100 or fewer amino acids (13). To gain synthetic access to longer polypeptide chains, ligation of a larger number of peptide segment building blocks must be used. To date, essentially all three-segment syntheses have been performed in a rather inflexible fashion by sequential ligations starting from the Cterminal peptide segment with extension toward the N terminus. Multiple rounds of ligation and intermediate product purification typically result in substantial losses. This problem has been minimized by carrying out several ligations in a one-pot manner (23), but the rapid build up of impurities effectively limits such one-pot syntheses to only three segments. For these reasons, a more efficient convergent synthetic strategy is needed. We recently introduced the concept of kinetically controlled ligation (KCL) (24), which enables the reaction of a peptide thioarylester and a Cys­peptide thioalkylester to yield a single product. This process enables the synthesis of a protein in a fully convergent fashion (24). In a convergent synthesis (Scheme 1), each starting peptide segment is approximately the same number of chemical transformations away from the final product (25). This

fact becomes particularly significant when multiple analogs of a given target have to be prepared and the sites of modification are scattered across the entire sequence. Convergent synthesis, in principle, also will increase final yields when compared with sequential assembly tactics (25). In this article, we report the reproducible convergent chemical synthesis of human lysozyme, a 130-aa residue protein molecule containing four disulfides. The structure of the synthetic protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry, 2D TOCSY NMR, and high-resolution (1.04 Å) x-ray diffraction. The synthetic enzyme had full catalytic activity.

arylester (28). Formation of the C-terminal half of human lysozyme corresponding to residues 65­130 can be accomplished by ligating [Thz65-Ala94]- thioalkylester with [Cys95-Val130]. In this case, the N-terminal Cys65 needs to be protected temporarily, which can be achieved by using 1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (Thz) (23, 29). In the convergent synthetic scheme, the full-length product [Lys1Val130] is obtained by ligating the two halves of the target polypeptide, after which folding and disulfide formation are used to yield the native enzyme molecule.
Synthesis of Peptide Segment Building Blocks. Peptide segments

for the total chemical synthesis of the human lysozyme molecule is shown in Scheme 1. Human lysozyme contains eight cysteines, which are distributed evenly across the polypeptide chain and form four disulfide bonds in the folded enzyme molecule (Scheme 1). All cysteines could serve as potential ligation sites. We envisioned a final ligation of two large peptide segments to give the 130-residue polypeptide chain. To optimize the synthesis, we used four peptide segments of approximately equal length: peptides 1­29, 30­64, 65­94, and 95­130. These peptides are of convenient length ( 29­35 aa), and their preparation by optimized stepwise Boc chemistry SPPS (26) was expected to be straightforward. In terms of reaction rates, the chosen ligation sites (Met29-Cys30, Trp64-Cys65, and Ala94-Cys95) were selected to be straightforward, i.e., product formation was expected to occur rapidly (27) (unlike with Ile/Val/ Thr/Pro-Cys ligation sites). According to Scheme 1, generation of the N-terminal half of the enzyme (corresponding to residues 1­64) can be achieved by KCL of [Lys1-Met29]- thioarylester with [Cys30-Trp(CHO)64]- thioalkylester to form [Lys1-Trp(CHO)64]- thioalkylester. The peptide thioarylester was generated by transthioesterification from the corresponding thioalkylester by using an excess of 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA). The latter compound recently was shown to be a superior thiol catalyst to the established and widely used thiophenol, and it is particularly useful for the facile conversion of a peptide thioalkylester to the corresponding peptide thioDurek et al.

were prepared by using in situ neutralization Boc chemistry SPPS protocols as described in ref. 26. Segments 1­29, 30 ­ 64, and 65­94 were prepared on modified TAMPAL resins generating C-terminal thioalkylesters upon HF cleavage (27). Segment 95­130 carrying a free carboxyl group was synthesized on OCH2-Pam resin. All five tryptophans were incorporated as Trp(CHO), and His 78 was incorporated as His(Dnp). As expected, both the Trp(CHO) and His(Dnp) side-chain protecting groups were unaffected by the HF/pcresol treatment used for deprotection and cleavage from the resin. These protecting groups typically are removed under conditions that are not fully compatible with thioesters and thus were removed at later stages of the synthesis. During our initial studies on ligation reactions between Cys-containing lysozyme peptides, we observed unusually slow reaction rates ( 24 h until completion), which we attributed to the large number of unprotected internal cysteines forming unproductive internal thioesters (thiolactones), which slow down product formation. This finding seemed to be even more pronounced when preformed thioarylesters, which are more activated toward nucleophilic attack than standard thioalkylesters are, were used (28, 30). In one particular case, incubation of a peptide thioester containing a single ``internal'' cysteine residue under ligation conditions led to almost quantitative thiolactone formation within seconds. Although such a side reaction would only slow down a normal NCL reaction, we reasoned that the effect of thiolactone formation on a KCL would be more deleterious because kinetic control relies on the

Assembly of the N-Terminal Half. For KCL of [Lys1-Met29]- thioester

and [Cys30-Trp(CHO)64]- thioester, the segment 1­29 first was transthioesterified with MPAA in a separate reaction (Scheme 1i) (24, 28). The resulting purified [Lys1-Met29]- thio(4-carboxymethyl)phenyl ester 1 was reacted with [Cys 30 -Trp(CHO) 64 ]thioalkylester 2 in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride/0.2 M sodium phosphate under KCL conditions, i.e., in the absence of added thiol catalyst (Scheme 1ii). Liquid chromatography (LC) analysis (Fig. 1) indicated that most starting material was consumed within 5 h, and a heterogeneous compound mixture consisting mainly of [Lys1Trp(CHO)64]-Cys30- thiolactone 3 and the branched thioester [Lys1- Cys30([Lys1-Met29])-Trp(CHO)64]- thioester 4 had been formed (Fig. 1B). The product mixture was resolved by adding sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), which effectively reversed all undesired side products by transthioesterification to give the N-terminal half [Lys1-Trp(CHO)64]- MESNA thioester 5 in good yield [51% after purification; LC-MS observed (obsd.) mass, 7,799.6 0.8 Da; calculated (calcd.) mass, 7,798.7 Da (average isotopes)] (Fig. 1C). The formation of such unwanted thioester species is typical of KCL and represents an undesirable side reaction. Especially formation of the branched thioester 4 can be expected to be the principal reason for nonquantitative KCL (aside from oligomerization and cyclization) because it dissipates precious activated peptide thioarylester.
Assembly of the C-Terminal Half. The C-terminal half of lysozyme representing residues 65­130 was obtained by ligating [Thz65Ala94]- thioester and [Cys95-Val130]. Segment 65­94 contains a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine. To prevent undesired side reactions (cyclization, oligomerization, etc.), during the envisaged first ligation reaction with segment 95­130 we protected Cys65 as the Thz. Conversion of Thz to Cys is achieved readily by treatment with alkoxyamines at pH 4, generating the desired free N-terminal cysteine, which can be used in another round of ligation (23, 29). Before ligation, [Thz65-Ala94]- thioalkylester was transthioesterified with 120 mM 2-mercaptophenylacetic acid in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.2 M sodium phosphate at pH 6.8. This procedure not only generated the more reactive [Thz65-Ala94]- thio(4carboxymethyl)phenyl ester 6 but also led to rapid and efficient dinitrophenyl (DNP) removal from His78, thus simplifying the ligation reaction product mixture (Scheme 1iii). Ligation of purified [Thz65-Ala94]- thio(4-carboxymethyl)phenyl ester 6 and [Cys95Val130] 7 was carried out in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, 30 mM MPAA, and 20 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at pH 6.8 (Scheme 1iv). The reaction was complete within 2 h (based on LC analysis) (Fig. 2) after which methoxyamine HCl was added to 0.4 M and the pH was adjusted to 4.0 to effect the conversion of Thz65 to Cys65 (Scheme 1v) (23). Deprotection was quantitative within 6 h, and the resulting 66-residue peptide 8 was purified by reversed-phase HPLC (RPHPLC) [obsd. electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS mass, 7,539.8 0.7 Da; calcd., 7,539.2 Da].

ester 5 and [Cys65-Val130] 8 was performed under the same conditions as described above for the synthesis of [Cys65-Val130] (Scheme 1vi; see Fig. 3 for analytical data). The reaction was complete within 12 h. After solid-phase extraction and elution into 50% (vol/vol) aceonitrile-water containing 0.1% (vol/vol) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the S-Acm side-chain protecting groups subsequently were removed by treatment with a large excess of AgOAc (35 equiv. per S-Acm group) over 10 h. Silver thiolates were converted to the free thiols by adding a large excess of DTT; a precipitate was formed immediately (consisting of Ag­DTT complexes). In previous attempts to prepare lysozyme by total chemical synthesis, the removal of S-Acm protecting groups had proved problematic (15). Modern MALDI-MS allowed us rapidly to optimize removal of the Acm groups. Acm deprotection initially was studied on model peptides,

comparing AgOAc and Hg(OAc)2 deprotection protocols under otherwise similar conditions. In our hands, AgOAc-mediated Acm removal was significantly slower than Acm deprotection by Hg(OAc)2. However MALDI-MS analysis indicated that decomposition of the formed Hg-thiolate compounds turned out to be more challenging and required longer reaction times and a larger excess of DTT when compared with the corresponding Ag-thiolates (data not shown). For this reason, we chose to stick to the AgOAc protocol, which also has been reported to be milder in the presence of sensitive amino acid residues (31, 32). Tryptophan formyl protecting groups (five in total) then were removed by treating the crude peptide with 20% (vol/vol) piperidine and 38% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol in aqueous guanidine hydrochloride solution for 40 min at 0°C. The HPLC-purified fully deprotected and reduced 130-aa polypeptide [supporting information (SI) Fig. 6 A] was obtained in reasonable yield [28% overall yield for (ligation removal of Acm and formyl protecting groups HPLC purification), based on the starting reactants 5 and 8; ESI-MS obsd. average mass, 14,700.2 1.5 Da; calcd., 14,700.7 Da].
Folding, Disulfide Formation, and Product Characterization. The pu-

rified 130-residue polypeptide chain was folded by dilution into buffer containing a redox system consisting of 5 mM oxidized glutathione and 2 mM DTT at pH 8 (final peptide concentration after dilution was 0.175 mg/ml). After 14 h, formation of the correctly folded structure was revealed on LC analysis by the appearance of a sharp peak eluting at earlier retention time (SI Fig. 6). Such a shift in retention time has been observed in numerous cases upon (re)folding of disulfide cross-linked globular proteins and reflects the burial of hydrophobic residues within the protein core. The sharp peak was preceded by a poorly resolved unidenDurek et al.

tifiable compound mixture probably representing nonnative disulfide isomers of the lysozyme molecule. ESI-MS analysis of the principal peak revealed a mass of 14,693.4 0.7 Da (Fig. 4). This value corresponds to a loss of 6.8 2.2 Da, which is in excellent agreement with the formation of four disulfides and the concomitant loss of eight protons (calcd., 14,692.7 Da; average isotopes). Folded synthetic lysozyme was purified from the crude folding solution by RP-HPLC and was recovered in good yield (40%). ESI-MS, MALDI-MS, and RP-HPLC analysis indicated high purity of the synthetic material (Fig. 4A and SI Figs. 6C and 7). The conformational homogeneity of the synthetic protein was demonstrated by 1D 1H-NMR and 2D TOCSY 1H-1H NMR spectroscopy under solution conditions. SI Fig. 8 A and B shows the dispersion of chemical shifts in the amide/aromatic and aliphatic spectral regions of the 1D 1H-NMR spectrum. The 2D TOCSY 1H-1H NMR spectrum of the aliphatic spin systems is shown in Fig. 4B. The observed chemical shifts are identical to those assigned in the spectrum of biosynthetic human lysozyme (33, 34) and indicate native folding and the absence of detectable misfolded conformations in the synthetic sample. The synthetic enzyme was crystallized, and its 3D structure was determined by x-ray diffraction. Data were collected to a resolution of 1.04 Å (SI Table 1). The structure was solved by rigid-body approximation followed by restrained mixed anisotropic/isotropic refinement to an R factor of 0.136 and an Rfree of 0.151 for 50­1.04 Å data by using a previously reported structure as a starting model (PDB ID code 1JSF) (Fig. 5) (35). Superposition of the obtained structure with previous structures obtained from biosynthetic human lysozyme (35) revealed identical covalent structures and highly similar native folds. To unequivocally demonstrate anticipated enzymatic function, the synthetic protein product was tested for lysozyme activity by using a well established assay (36). In this assay, the clearance of a bacterial cell-wall suspension as a result of lysozyme-mediated cell-wall degradation is measured spectrophotometrically.

was assembled from four peptide segments in a fully convergent manner by using modern chemical ligation methods. The size ( 30 aa) of the peptide segments used makes them easily accessible by SPPS combined with standard HPLC purifications, even in the hands of only moderately experienced peptide chemists. Our convergent synthetic design is especially well suited for the preparation of various lysozyme analogs because any desired chemical modifications or biophysical labels can be introduced at any position of the molecule without the need for a change in strategy. Because of a high degree of sequence conservation within the c-type lysozyme family and a highly conserved location of cysteine residues in particular (7), we also believe that the synthetic approach will be applicable to other c-type lysozyme family members, for example, hen egg-white lysozyme. Convergent synthesis is made possible by KCL, which has proven to be a practical way of controlling the reactivity of peptide thioesters (24). The 130-residue lysozyme protein molecule is the second and thus far the largest example prepared in a convergent fashion by using a combination of NCL and KCL. The convergent synthesis of lysozyme by KCL comes at a price, namely, the requirement for additional steps in the synthetic scheme: transthioesterification reactions and the need for additional Cys protecting groups and their removal. Although the transthioesterification may be obviated by direct on-resin synthesis of the peptide thio(4carboxymethyl)phenyl esters (37), we believe that the use of Cys protecting groups needs further examination. The ability to efficiently assemble proteins from four synthetic peptide segments, and the increased flexibility in the design of a synthetic route, will provide a further boost to the field of chemical protein synthesis, which we expect to translate into a more detailed understanding of the chemical basis of protein function.

concentration of 1 mM.¶ MPAA was added to 120 mM, and the pH was adjusted to 6.5­6.8. The mixture was stirred for 2­6 h at room temperature. Yields were typically 80­90% (based on HPLC analysis of the crude reaction mixture). After the reaction mixture reached equilibrium, the product was purified by preparative RP-HPLC. The obtained lyophilized thioarylesters were stable for several months at 4°C.
NCL and KCL. NCL was carried out in degassed ligation buffer (6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, 20 mM TCEP, and 30 mM MPAA) at a peptide concentration of 1­2 mM. The pH was kept at 6.8­7.0 at all times. KCL of [Lys1-Met29]- thio(4carboxymethyl)phenyl ester and [Cys30-Trp(CHO)64]- thioalkylester was performed under the same conditions, except that MPAA and TCEP were omitted from the reaction mixture. Folding and Disulfide Formation. Purified, reduced, and fully sidechain deprotected polypeptide corresponding to [Lys1-Val130] (6.3 mg) was dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, and 20 mM 1,4-DTT (pH 8.0) at a peptide concentration of 7 mg/ml. Folding was achieved by 1:40 dilution into refolding buffer [0.8 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M Tris HCl, 5 mM oxidized glutathione, 2 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)]. After gentle stirring overnight at room temperature, the reaction mixture was centrifuged and decanted, and the supernatant was loaded onto a semipreparative Vydac C4 column (10 250 mm). Correctly folded material was eluted by using a linear gradient of 10­40% buffer B in buffer A over 60 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min.
