Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima (TmIDH) catalyses NADP+- and metal-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate. It belongs to the b-decarboxylating dehydrogenase family and is the only hyperthermostable IDH identified within subfamily II. Furthermore, it is the only IDH that has been characterized as both dimeric and tetrameric in solution. We solved ° the crystal structure of the dimeric apo form of TmIDH at 2.2 A. The R-factor of the refined model was 18.5% (Rfree 22.4%). The conformation of the TmIDH structure was open and showed a domain rotation of 25­ 30° compared with closed IDHs. The separate domains were found to be homologous to those of the mesophilic mammalian IDHs of subfamily II and were subjected to a comparative analysis in order to find differences that could explain the large difference in thermostability. Mutational studies revealed that stabilization of the N- and C-termini via long-range electrostatic interactions were important for the higher thermostability of TmIDH. Moreover, the number of intra- and intersubunit ion pairs was higher and the ionic networks were larger compared with the mesophilic IDHs. Other factors likely to confer higher stability in TmIDH were a less hydrophobic and more charged accessible surface, a more hydrophobic subunit interface, more hydrogen bonds per residue and a few loop deletions. The residues responsible for the binding of isocitrate and NADP+ were found to be highly conserved between TmIDH and the mammalian IDHs and it is likely that the reaction mechanism is the same.

The enzymes of hyperthermophilic organisms are remarkably stable and can resist denaturation at temperatures ranging from 80 °C to above 130 °C [1,2], whereas their counterparts from mesophilic organisms are usually denatured at around 50 °C. However, they are often homologous and their catalytic mechanisms are usually identical [3]. Moreover, the gain in free stabilization energy in hyperthermostable proteins, compared with their mesophilic homologues, is generally

small, especially at the growth temperature of the organisms [4]. Typically, the net free energy of stabilization in both mesophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins, is 5­20 kcalÆmol)1, which is equivalent to only a small number of weak intermolecular interactions [3,5,6]. There is no single mechanism or structural feature that is responsible for the high thermotolerance of hyperthermostable proteins [4,7]. The most common determinants of hyperthermostability that have been

observed are more ionic interactions at the protein surface and increased formation of large ionic networks [8­10]. Electrostatic optimization and the reduction in repulsive charge­charge interactions are crucial [11,12]. However, in many cases, the combined effects of multiple, modestly stabilizing interactions seem to be responsible for enhanced thermostability. Examples include a reduction in the hydrophobic accessible surface area, increased hydrogen bonding, stronger intersubunit interactions, loop deletions and structural compactness [13­15]. In order to analyse thermotolerance comparatively within one protein family, we chose isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), a metal-dependent (Mg2+ or Mn2+) enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle which catalyses the subsequent dehydrogenation and decarboxylation of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate using NAD+ or NADP+ as a cofactor [16]. Owing to its central role in metabolism, IDH is present in organisms from all three domains of life, Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. Consequently, IDH is also present in organisms that have adapted to a wide range of growth temperatures making it an attractive model enzyme for studying heat-adaptive traits. In a previous publication, we characterized hyperthermostable IDHs from Thermotoga maritima (TmIDH), Aeropyrum pernix (ApIDH), Pyrococcus furiosus (PfIDH) and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfIDH) with respect to phylogenetic affiliation, cofactor specificity, thermostability and oligomeric state, and identified three different subfamilies of IDH [17]. ApIDH, AfIDH and PfIDH showed high sequence identity to IDH from the mesophile Escherichia coli (EcIDH) and they formed, together with all known archaeal IDHs as well as most bacterial IDHs, subfamily I. Within subfamily II, the bacterial and eukaryotic NADP+-IDHs were grouped into different branches. However, TmIDH was separated from both and represented the deepest branch of this subfamily. ApIDH in subfamily I was described as the most thermostable IDH, with an apparent melting temperature of 109.9 °C and TmIDH was described as the only hyperthermostable IDH known within subfamily II with an apparent melting temperature of 98.3 °C. Moreover, we identified a heterogeneous mixture of tetrameric and dimeric species of TmIDH in solution, in which the tetrameric form of TmIDH represented a unique oligomeric state of NADP-IDH. Here, we report the crystal structure of TmIDH, representing the first bacterial structure of an IDH from subfamily II. The crystallographic structure is presented in the dimeric form as crystallization trials of the tetrameric form of TmIDH have been unsuccessful to date.

In order to reveal possible determinants of the increased thermotolerance of TmIDH, we compared the structure of the dimeric form with the mesophilic mammalian homologues porcine mitochondrial IDH (PcIDH) and human cytosolic IDH (HcIDH) from the same subfamily. The observed differences were then compared with differences between ApIDH and its mesophilic homologue EcIDH in subfamily I. Furthermore, the analysis was used as a guideline to design specific mutants of TmIDH. Their properties are discussed with respect to the main mechanisms involved in protein thermostabilization.

Results and Discussion
Purification of the dimeric form of TmIDH We previously described TmIDH as a heterogenous mixture of dimeric and tetrameric species [17]. Recently, the crystal structure of tetrameric homoisocitrate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus was solved and it was suggested that formation of the tetramer was involved in thermostabilization [18]. New analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) data on TmIDH confirmed that two oligomeric species with S20,W values corresponding to a tetramer ( 7.9 S) and a dimer ( 5.0 S) are present in the preparation using the previously described purification protocol (data not shown) [17]. In order to separate the two oligomeric forms, a gelfiltration step was added and the separate fractions were analysed using AUC. The AUC data demonstrated that dimeric and tetrameric species do not reequilibrate to a heterogenous mixture (Fig. 1). Thus, the dimeric and tetrameric forms were not in equilibrium and could be separated. The two forms were concentrated and subjected to various crystallization trials. To date, crystals of the tetrameric species of TmIDH

have not been obtained, whereas the dimeric form produced good quality crystals that were used to solve the structure. Quality and description of the model The crystal structure of TmIDH was solved by molecu° lar replacement at 2.2 A and represents the apo form of the enzyme. The atomic coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 1ZOR). The model (Fig. 2A) was refined to a crystallographic R-value of 18.4% and a free R-value of 22.3%. It was crystallized as a dimer in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 54.8% corresponding to ° a Matthews' coefficient of 2.7 A3ÆDa)1. The two subunits were related by a twofold noncrystallographic rotation axis and are referred to as subunits A and B. The space group was P212121 and the unit cell parame° ° ° ters a ¼ 62.5 A, b ¼ 88.1 A, c ¼ 180.9 A. The symmetry-related molecules in the crystal did not produce the tetrameric form. Electron-density maps of subunit A were of very high quality throughout the structure determination, whereas density maps of the large domain of subunit B lacked density for many side chains. This was probably caused by a local disorder in the crystal resulting from the flexibility of the large domains in combination with the particular crystal packing. However, these side chains were maintained in the model with ideal conformations (as defined by the rotamers of the o database) except for residues B1­3, which were omitted because of dubious main chain density. In subunit A, only three side chains were lacking density and more solvent molecules were built compared with subunit B. In total, 428 water molecules were built. In both subunits, some residues were modelled with two conformations with 50% occupancy each (Lys A48, Lys A62, Glu A81, Lys A84, Arg A109, Lys A183, Lys A220, Asn A240, Glu A300, Arg A307, Arg A308, Arg A335, Glu A348, Glu

The rmsd values from ideal geometry were within reasonable limits and the Ramachandran plot showed that 90.8 and 89.6% of the residues in subunits A and B, respectively, fall within the most favourable region. Asn159 in subunit B was found in a disallowed conformation, which may be explained by unclear density and its location in a sharp turn between strand M2 and M3. Table 1 summarizes the quality of the data and the model. Several crystal structures of different IDHs have been reported: E. coli IDH [19] [EcIDH, PDB codes 3ICD (closed) and 1SJS (open)], Aeropyrum pernix IDH [20] (ApIDH, PDB codes 1XGV, 1TYO and 1XKD) and Bacillus subtilis IDH [21] (BsIDH, PDB code 1HQS) representing subfamily I and PcIDH [22] (PcIDH, PDB code 1LWD) and HcIDH [23] [HcIDH, PDB code 1T0L (closed) and 1T09 (open)] from sub2854

family II. They are all homodimeric NADP+-IDHs and their common folds are shared also by the crystal structures of isopropylmalate dehydrogenase which uses a substrate containing the malate moiety in common with isocitrate and belongs to the same family of b-decarboxylating dehydrogenases [24­26]. TmIDH showed highest structural similarity to PcIDH and HcIDH, the two other members of subfamily II IDHs for which the structure are known. Hyperthermostable enzymes are often smaller than their homologues from mesophiles. The amino acid sequence of TmIDH is shorter than PcIDH and HcIDH. TmIDH has 399 amino acid residues, whereas PcIDH and HcIDH contain 413 and 414 residues, respectively. However, all of the sequenced bacterial IDHs in this subfamily (i.e. also those from mesophiles and psycrophiles) have shorter sequences than the eukaryotic IDHs. Therefore, the shorter sequence of TmIDH is most likely a phylogenetic characteristic and not an adaptation to higher temperature. All IDH subunits consist of three domains: a large domain, a small domain and a clasp domain (Fig. 2A). In TmIDH, residues 1­119 and 281­399 belong to the large domain, residues 120­140 and 182­280 constitute the small domain and residues 141­181 form the clasp domain. The large domain is connected to the small domain by a flexible hinge region. TmIDH was found in an open conformation with relative differences in the rotation of the large domain of  30° compared with the closed ternary isocitrate­NADP+­Ca2+­HcIDH complex (PDB code: 1T0L) and of  25° compared with the binary isocitrate­PcIDH complex. Compared with the most open subunit of the binary NADP+­HcIDH complex (PDB code: 1T09), TmIDH was  6° more open. The clasp domain in TmIDH was typical for subfamily II, with two stacked four-stranded antiparallel b sheets instead of the two antiparallel a helices beneath a single fourstranded antiparallel b sheet characteristic for subfamily I IDHs. Because of different conformations, the large and the small domains of each homologue were compared separately. The rmsd values between the Ca-carbons of the large domain of TmIDH and that of PcIDH and ° ° HcIDH were 0.92 A (using 231 Ca-atoms) and 0.97 A (230 Ca-atoms), respectively, when the nonconserved loops in PcIDH and HcIDH were excluded. Superposition of the small domains, together with the clasp domain, exhibited rmsd values between TmIDH and ° PcIDH and HcIDH of 0.84 A (161 Ca-atoms) and ° 0.88 A (159 Ca-atoms), respectively. Overlays of the different domains of TmIDH, HcIDH and PcIDH are shown in Fig. 2B,C. Because of a transformation of the secondary structure in the open form of HcIDH,

which is discussed more in detail below, the separate domains of the closed form of HcIDH were used in the superposition. All secondary structural elements were conserved in TmIDH, PcIDH and HcIDH. In total there were 16 a helices (44.9% of the residues in TmIDH) and 16 b strands (19.5% of the residues in TmIDH). In addition, one 310 helix was identified in TmIDH. The total secondary structure content of 65.2% was only slightly different from that of PcIDH (64.4%) and HcIDH (66.2%). A structure-based sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 3. TmIDH has a loop deletion of three and four residues, compared with PcIDH and HcIDH, respectively, between strands M2 and M3 in the clasp domain (Fig. 2C). Other loop deletions were found between helices g1 and g2 (one residue), strands E and D (one residue) and helices l and m (five and four residues, respectively, Fig. 2B). The two latter loop deletions were also identified in several bacterial IDHs of mesophiles from this subfamily and must be considered as phylogenetic characteristics. The two first-loop deletions, however, were not found in any mesophilic IDH. This finding is in agreement with earlier observations that proteins of hyperthermohiles often have shorter loops [15,27]. In this way, fraying elements where the structure might begin to unfold, are reduced. Differences between the subunits Subunits A and B of TmIDH were very similar. Superposition of the small domains showed an rmsd of ° 0.27 A for the Ca-atoms, whereas the rmsd between ° the large domains was 0.32 A. The relative difference in the rotation of the large domain between the two subunits was 2.6°. Dimer association The interface in TmIDH was found to be similar to that of PcIDH and HcIDH. The dimer associates through the formation of the clasp domain and via hydrophobic interactions between helices h and i in both subunits to form a stable four-helix bundle. The active site The active site of the IDHs is formed in the cleft between the small and the large domains and contains residues from both domains and both subunits. The substrate-binding residues of TmIDH were investigated by superposition of the active site residues from each domain of TmIDH and the closed substrate-bound

HcIDH and PcIDH separately. The putative isocitratebinding residues from the large domain, Thr77, Ser94 and Asn96, were very well aligned with rmsd values of ° 0.362 and 0.257 A between TmIDH vs. PcIDH and HcIDH, respectively, for all 21 atoms. Arg100 and Arg109 are also putative isocitrate-binding residues but showed slightly different conformations in TmIDH, most likely due to the absence of isocitrate in TmIDH. However, the isocitrate-binding residues from the small domain, Arg132, Tyr139 and Lys208¢ (the prime indicates the neighbouring subunit of the dimer) were still well aligned with rmsd values of 0.525 and ° 0.950 A between TmIDH vs. PcIDH and HcIDH, respectively, for all 32 atoms. The metal-coordinating residues Asp247¢, Asp270 and Asp274 were also struc° turally similar with rmsd values of 0.745 and 1.056 A for all 24 atoms between TmIDH vs. PcIDH and HcIDH, respectively. (The equivalent of Asp247¢ shows quite a different conformation in HcIDH which is likely due to the absence of isocitrate in TmIDH.) In the metal (Mg2+ or Mn2+)-binding site, a Na+ ion was built as it was the only positively charged ion present in the crystallization buffer and no remaining |Fo| ) |Fc| electron density could be observed at 2.0 sigma after it was built. The Na+ ion was coordinated by six oxygen ligands in both subunits. Two waters (waters 185 and 427 in subunit A and waters 284 and 289 in subunit B), the carbonyl oxygen of Asp270 and Asp247¢ represented the equatorial ligands, whereas Asp270 and Asp274 were the axial ligands. Cofactor binding The b-decarboxylating dehydrogenases share a unique cofactor-binding site that differs from the well-known Rossmann fold found in many other dehydrogenases [19,24,28]. Only a few amino acid residues appear to be responsible for the discrimination between NAD+ and NADP+ [29­32]. The residues which interact with the 2¢-phosphate of NADP+ are responsible for the discrimination between NAD+ / NADP+. All of the residues involved in binding of the NADP+ in the ternary HcIDH complex (PDB code 1T0L) were found to be conserved in TmIDH except a lysine (Lys260 in HcIDH) which interacts with the 2¢-phosphate of NADP+. This lysine was replaced by Arg255¢ in TmIDH and might still be important for the discrimination between NAD+ and NADP+. Presumably, the other residues interacting with the 2¢phosphate in TmIDH are Arg308, His309 and Gln252¢. However, close to Arg308 and His309 there was another arginine (Arg312) in TmIDH directed towards the supposed 2¢-phosphate of NADP+. In

PcIDH and HcIDH, this arginine is replaced by a Glu (318) and Met (318), respectively. It is therefore possible that the cofactor binding is slightly different in TmIDH compared with PcIDH and HcIDH. However, all other residues putatively involved in binding of NADP+ were conserved structurally. The adenine ring-binding residues correspond to His303, Val306, Thr321 and Asn322, whereas Gly304, Thr305 and Val306 should interact with the 5¢-phosphate of the adenine. Thr77 and Arg82 are equivalent to the residues which bind the hydroxyl groups of the nicotinamide ribose. Thr75, Lys72 and Asn96 most likely bind the amide group of the nicotinamide. The rmsd between TmIDH and the NADP+­isocitrate­HcIDH­ ° complex (PDB code: 1T0L) was only 0.359 A for all 92 atoms of these residues which do not bind the 2¢-phosphate. Between TmIDH and PcIDH without ° NADP+, the rmsd was 0.615 A for all 92 atoms. The structural conservation of the isocitrate- and NADP+-binding residues suggests that isocitrate and NADP+ binding is highly conserved between TmIDH and the mammalian IDHs and that these enzymes most likely share the same catalytic mechanism. For a description of the mechanism, see Karlstrom et al. [20] ¨ and Hurley et al. [16]. Putative phosphorylation site In EcIDH, phosporylation of Ser113 in the so-called `phosphorylation loop' by IDH kinase / phosphatase is proposed to inactivate the enzyme by blocking the binding of isocitrate to the active site both sterically and by electrostatic repulsion of the c­carboxyl group of isocitrate [33­36]. Whether this regulatory mechanism exists in other IDHs is not clear. In the closed ternary complex of HcIDH (PDB code: 1T0L), the conserved helix i in the small domain is similar to that observed in all other NADP+­IDH structures and is part of the four-helix bundle at the dimer interface. However, in the absence of isocitrate, the enzyme has adopted an open conformation (PDB code: 1T09) and helix i is found unwound into a loop conformation where Asp279 interacts with Ser94 of the large domain in the active site. This interaction mimics the phosphorylation of the equivalent serine in EcIDH which

inhibits the binding of isocitrate and makes the enzyme inactive. It has been postulated that the new interaction in HcIDH is competing with isocitrate in binding to the active site and a self-regulatory mechanism of activity is thereby provided [23]. In the open form of TmIDH without isocitrate that we report here, this helix is maintained and the self-regulating mechanism is therefore not supported. The serine in the `phosphorylation loop' is, however, conserved in TmIDH and PcIDH (Ser94 and Ser95, respectively). Thermostability By sequence comparison, PcIDH and HcIDH are 51.3 and 52.2% identical to TmIDH, respectively. Nevertheless, the structural homology makes them suitable for a comparison in order to identify differences which can be related to thermostability. The apparent melting temperature (Tm) of PcIDH was determined to 59.0 °C, i.e. 39.3 °C lower than the apparent Tm of TmIDH. Below, we try to relate the large Tm difference to structural determinants that presumably cause this highly increased thermotolerance of TmIDH. The revealed differences between TmIDH and its mesophilic homologues in subfamily II are thereafter related to the differences observed between ApIDH and its mesophilic homologue EcIDH in subfamily I. The latter comparison was made between the open ApIDH (PDB code 1TYO) and the open EcIDH (PDB code 1SJS) and might be slightly different from comparison between ApIDH and the closed EcIDH done previously [20]. The sequence identity between TmIDH and ApIDH is only 22.3% (a sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 3). The major driving force in protein stability and folding is considered to be `the hydrophobic effect' which results in the burial of most of the hydrophobic residues in the protein core [37,38]. The hydrophobic effect explains why many hyperthermostable proteins show a significant increase in the number of buried hydrophobic residues at the core or at subunit interfaces, and is sometimes reflected by more hydrophobic residues in the sequence [39­42]. This trend could also be observed in TmIDH which has 42.9% hydrophobic residues, whereas PcIDH and HcIDH have 39.5 and 39.4%, respectively (Table 2). However, many differ-

ences between proteins from hyperthermophiles and mesophiles are observed on the surface of the protein subunits. The contribution of hydrophobic residues at the protein surface will affect the stability of the protein unfavorably in aqueous solution, whereas hydrophilic residues will help to solvate the protein and thereby stabilize it. Accordingly, the accessible surface area of hyperthermostable proteins is commonly more polar or charged and less hydrophobic [8,9,11,43­45]. Surface and interface characteristics First, the open form of TmIDH reported here, was compared with the open form of HcIDH. However, one must bear in mind that two of the helices (i and i¢) in the interfacial four-helix bundle are unfolded in the open HcIDH, giving the surface and the subunit interface a different character. Therefore, we show data for the open HcIDH, the closed HcIDH and the closed PcIDH in Table 2. It was found that TmIDH has a 6.1% increase in charged accessible surface area, a 1.3% decrease in hydrophobic surface area and 4.8% decrease in polar surface area compared with the open HcIDH (Fig. 4A and Table 2). This is in line with earlier comparisons between enzymes from hyperthermophiles and mesophiles [3,42]. In this context, ApIDH is unusual having a less charged and more polar accessible surface than its mesophilic homologue EcIDH. However, the hydrophobic part is still reduced by 0.5% compared with the open EcIDH (Table 2). The small decrease in the hydrophobic part of the surfaces might seem insignificant. However, using 25 calÆ ° mol)1ÆA)2 for the hydrophobic contribution to the free energy of folding applied on the difference in accessible ° hydrophobic area in TmIDH (which was 2005 A2), )1 gives a free energy difference of  50 kcalÆmol indicating a contribution to stability in the expected order of magnitude [46,47]. Moreover, a reduction of the total solvent-exposed surface area has also been associated with increased stability [48,49]. The solvent-exposed surface area of ° TmIDH was 32 780 A2 which is considerably smaller ° than the 35 564 A2 of the open form of HcIDH. However, this is partially due to the shorter sequence of TmIDH. Therefore, the surface-to-volume ratio was determined [50]. For TmIDH it was 0.211, whereas for the open HcIDH it was 0.224, indicating a slight decrease in the accessible surface. The same trend was observed between ApIDH (0.208) and EcIDH (0.214). In principle, a decrease in the accessible surface might be due to increased burial of the molecular surface at the subunit interface. However, both TmIDH and ApIDH were found to have a smaller relative

interface area compared with their respective homologues. Because of the unwinding of helix i belonging to the interfacial four-helix bundle in the open HcIDH, we preferred to compare the interface area of TmIDH with that of the closed HcIDH and PcIDH. It was found that 16.7% of the total molecular surface of the two TmIDH subunits was buried at the interface, whereas 18.5 and 17.6% of the closed HcIDH and PcIDH surfaces were buried, respectively. The interface of ApIDH was proportionately smaller than both the open and the closed EcIDH (Table 2) [20]. The interface of TmIDH showed a 5% increase in hydrophobic area and a 1.2% decrease in charged area compared with the closed HcIDH (Fig. 4B, Table 2).

Fig. 5. (A) The mutation D389N decreased the apparent melting temperature (Tm) of TmIDH by 21.8 °C. At a cut-off distance of ° 4 A, Asp389 formed a conserved ion pair with Lys29, connecting ° both termini with each other. At a 6 A cut-off, the ion pair was involved in a nonconserved four-member ionic network with Lys318 and Glu385. (B) Arg186 made interactions with Glu182, Glu225 and Glu226 and was part of a five-member ionic network. However, mutation R186M did not affect the apparent Tm of TmIDH. (C) Mutation F205M reduced the apparent Tm by 3.5 °C. Phe205 was found to have a central position in an aromatic cluster in the small domain involving Phe188, Phe219, Phe223, Tyr215, Tyr241 and His133. All but Phe205 were conserved within subfamily II. The result confirms that aromatic clustering plays a role in increasing the apparent melting temperature of proteins.

A similar trend was found also when the interface of ApIDH was compared with that of the open homologue EcIDH. However, compared with the closed PcIDH, the interface of TmIDH was 3.5% less hydrophobic and 3.9% more charged (Table 2). Part of the hydrophobic contribution at the subunit interface in TmIDH involves a cluster of four methionines located in the interfacial four-helix bundle (Met272 and Met275 from both subunits). This methionine cluster was not present in PcIDH or HcIDH. However, below the four-helix bundle, on the top of the clasp domain, there was another, almost identical, intersubunit fourmembered methionine cluster (formed by Met176 and Met178 from both subunits), which was found to be conserved in these three IDHs. The additional methionine cluster in TmIDH might be important for the subunit interaction. It was also found that helix h of the interfacial four-helix bundle might be stabilized in TmIDH by three Ala residues in a row instead of one in PcIDH and two separate Ala residues as in HcIDH. Alanine is considered to be the most optimal helixforming amino acid [51,52]. Aromatic interactions Aromatic interactions are usually identified using a cut° off distance of 7 A between the aromatic ring centres [53]. The role of additional aromatic interactions in increasing the thermostability of proteins has been discussed elsewhere [53,54]. However, TmIDH was found to have a decreased fraction of aromatic residues (10.8%) compared with HcIDH (12.1%) and PcIDH (12.7%). However, a cluster of aromatic residues involving Phe205, Phe188, Phe219, Phe223, Tyr215, Tyr241 and His133 was identified in the small domain of TmIDH. All of these residues were conserved in PcIDH and HcIDH except Phe205, which has a central position in this cluster (Fig. 5C). A few other nonconserved

° aromatic residues were identified within 7 A of the residues of the mentioned cluster, e.g. Tyr218, Tyr243, Tyr135, His174 and His216 but they were all pointing away from the nearby aromatic residues and their involvement in the cluster was unclear. Charged residues and ionic interactions An ion pair is usually defined as an interaction ° between charged groups with a distance of up to 4.0 A between the charged nonhydrogen atoms [55]. An increased number of ion pairs and larger ionic networks are the most common features of hyperthermostable proteins observed in comparisons with mesophilic proteins [8,56]. Furthermore, according to model calculations and theoretical considerations, the stabilizing contribution of ion pairs increases at higher temperatures, because the desolvation penalty is decreased with higher temperatures, mainly due to a decrease in the dielectric constant of water [3,57]. In addition, it has been claimed that the dielectric constant of thermophilic proteins is increased, reducing the dielectric difference between the protein and the solvent, and thus the desolvation penalty, even more [58]. That the contribution of each ion pair can vary significantly depending on the local environment and the solvation, means that the interaction might also be ° considerable above the default 4.0 A cut-off [11,12]. Therefore, we analysed the number of ion pairs using ° cut-offs of 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 A and combined the analysis with results from differential scanning calorimetry and site-directed mutagenesis of certain ion pairs in order to detect interactions contributing the most to the thermotolerance of TmIDH. Comparison of ion pairs and hydrogen bonds was based on subunit A in all cases because many side chains lacked electron density in the large domain of subunit B in TmIDH. The quality of the electron-density map of the interfacecontaining small domain of subunit B was, however, fine, which allowed safe analysis of the number of intersubunit ion pairs. The total number of charged residues per monomer was higher in TmIDH: 126 (31.6% of the residues), than in PcIDH and HcIDH: 116 (28.1%) and 115 (27.8%), respectively (Table 2). The total number of ion pairs per monomer (including half of the intersubunit ion pairs in the dimer) was also slightly higher in TmIDH when a ° cut-off distance of 4 A was used; 35 compared with 30 and 32 in PcIDH and the closed form of HcIDH, respectively. However, because TmIDH was in the open form, it was more appropriate to compare it with the open form of HcIDH. The total number of ion pairs in the open monomer of HcIDH was only 24.5. The differFEBS Journal 273 (2006) 2851­2868 ª 2006 Karolinska Institutet

ence was clearer when the fractions defined by ion pairs per residue were compared; 0.088 in TmIDH compared with 0.073, 0.077 and 0.059 in PcIDH, HcIDH (closed) and HcIDH (open), respectively (Table 2). This finding is in agreement with other hyperthermostable proteins. However, it has previously been found that only at a ° cut-off of at least 4.2 A a significant increase in ion pairs in ApIDH compared with the closed EcIDH is observed [20]. This is also true in the present comparison of ApIDH with the open EcIDH where the fraction is ° 0.071 and 0.070 using a cut-off of 4.0 A, but 0.087 and ° cut-off for ApIDH and EcIDH, respect0.079 at a 4.2 A ively. The total number of intersubunit ion-pairs per dimer ° at a cut-off of 4 A was eight in TmIDH compared with four, six and one in PcIDH, HcIDH (closed) and HcIDH (open), respectively. Two of the intersubunit ion pairs were found in each active site, formed by Lys208 and Asp270 in TmIDH belonging to the fourhelix bundle. These residues were also part of a conserved four-member ionic network (see ionic network section below) and were involved in the binding of Mg2+-isocitrate. Another four of the intersubunit ion pairs were found in the clasp domain where two nonconserved 3-member ionic networks were located in both TmIDH and PcIDH. In TmIDH, each network contained two intersubunit ion pairs (between Glu151 and Glu153 of one subunit and Arg157 of the other subunit) and was extended to two 7-member intersub° unit ionic networks when a cut-off of 6 A was used. ° This extension was not observed in PcIDH at 6 A and the 3-member networks only contained one intersubunit ion pair each. The final intersubunit ion pairs in ° TmIDH at a cut-off of 4 A were formed on each subunit by Lys122 located on a loop on the small domain and Glu375 which was found on a loop on the large domain of the other subunit. The closed HcIDH contained in total six intersubunit ion pairs. All of these intersubunit ion pairs were gone in the open HcIDH because of the domain rotation and unfolding of helix i and i¢ belonging to the four-helix bundle. However, a new intersubunit ion pair was formed by Lys212 and Asp273. This increase in intersubunit ion pairs has been commonly observed in hyperthermostable pro° teins [52]. In ApIDH however, a cut-off of 6.0 A was needed to reveal a higher number of intersubunit ion pairs compared with EcIDH (Table 2). Ionic networks TmIDH was found to have larger ionic networks than PcIDH and HcIDH. The organization of ion pairs into large networks is a characteristic feature of hyperther2861

mophilic proteins [44]. Because of cooperativity, ionic networks contribute more to the stabilization energy of the protein than do the sum of the pairwise interactions [59,60]. In TmIDH, we identified one 3-member, one 4-member and two 5-member intrasubunit net° works in subunit A using a cut-off of 4 A, whereas in PcIDH and the closed HcIDH, we found four 3-member and one 4-member intrasubunit networks in the A subunit. In addition, a conserved 4-member intersubunit network was identified in each active site of all three IDHs and two 3-member intersubunit networks were found in the clasp domain of TmIDH and PcIDH. The number of intrasubunit networks in the open HcIDH was only slightly different compared with the closed form, whereas the intersubunit networks ° were absent at a 4.0 A cut-off (Table 2). Except for the large difference in intersubunit ion pairs and intersubunit ionic networks between TmIDH and the open form of HcIDH, the remaining difference between TmIDH, PcIDH and both HcIDHs was the 5-member networks found in TmIDH. One was located in the small domain and involved Glu182 and Arg186 on helix f and Glu225, Glu226 and Lys229 on helix g. The other was found in the large domain and was composed of of Glu17 (helix a), Arg82, Glu81 and Glu85 (helix c2) and Arg307 (helix j1). The largest networks ° in ApIDH and EcIDH are 4-membered at a 4.0 A cut° cut-off, three seven-member off. However, at a 4.2 A ionic networks were revealed in the ApIDH dimer, whereas only two 5-member networks appeared in the open EcIDH. These observations support earlier findings that hyperthermophiles often have more or larger ° ionic networks. When a cut-off distance of 6.0 A was used, the size of the ionic networks was increased only slightly in TmIDH compared with HcIDH and PcIDH ° (Table 2). However, using a 8 A cut-off resulted in one 44-member, one 43-member and two 26-member networks in TmIDH involving both subunits, whereas only one 26-member, one 23-member and one 20-member network was found in the open HcIDH dimer and one 43-member and one 39-member network in the closed PcIDH dimer. These results suggest a higher degree of charge compensation in TmIDH and that cooperation of weak ionic interactions in networks might also be important for thermostabilization. Hydrogen bonds A small increase in the fraction of hydrogen bonds per residue was observed in TmIDH (0.98) compared with PcIDH (0.97), the closed HcIDH; (0.92) and the open HcIDH (0.88). However, the determination of hydrogen bonds is highly resolution dependent.

Site-directed mutagenesis The mutant D389N was found to have an apparent Tm of 76.5 °C, i.e. a considerable decrease of almost 22 °C less than the recombinant wild-type form of TmIDH. Asp389 was located on helix m at the C-terminus and made an ionic interaction with Lys29 at a ° 4 A cut-off (Fig. 5A). This ion pair is conserved in PcIDH and HcIDH and is presumably involved in the protection of both termini from thermal unfolding which partially explains the large impact of this muta° tion. At a cut-off of 6.0 A, the ion pair was extended to a four-member ionic network in TmIDH through additional interactions with Glu385 and Lys318. These interactions could not be observed in PcIDH and HcIDH, indicating that the stabilizing effect of ion pairs is dependent on their local environment. There were also several other charged residues close by Asp389 which apparently makes it unusually sensitive to mutation. Another mutant of TmIDH which was investigated is D36N / D341N. It was found to have an apparent Tm of 88.5 °C, i.e.  10 °C less than the recombinant wild-type protein. The mutations of these two aspartates most likely interfere with the neutralization of the positive charges provided by Lys3, 5 and 7 at the very end of the N-terminus. The distances between the aspartates and the lysines were between ° 4.5 and 7.2 A. This result suggests that electrostatic compensation is crucial and confirms the importance of stabilizing the N-terminus to prevent thermal unfolding. TmIDH has the stabilization of its N-termini in common with ApIDH which has a disulfide bond at the N-termini between Cys9 and Cys87. The mutation C87S in ApIDH decreases the apparent melting temp by 9.6 °C [20]. These two mechanisms to stabilize the N-terminus complement each other. Often, proteins that are stabilized by disulfide bonds show a lower degree of electrostatic optimization [61]. One of the five-member ionic networks in TmIDH involved helices f and g located on the small domain. Arg186 has a central position in this network and interacts with three glutamates (182, 225 and 226) (Fig. 5B). However, the mutation R186M did not affect the apparent Tm of TmIDH. In contrast, one of the seven-member ionic networks in ApIDH was found to play an important role for the increased thermal stability [20]. Mutation R211M in ApIDH, which disrupts this network, decreases the apparent Tm by 11.3 °C. However, this network forms interdomain interactions and is located in the cleft at the opposite side of the active site, whereas in TmIDH, the fivemember networks were separately located on the different domains. The position of the mutated network

on the small domain, far away from the terminals, might be part of the reason why this mutation did not have any effect on the melting temperature. However, mutation F205M, which disrupts the aromatic cluster in the small domain mentioned above (Fig. 5C), reduced the apparent Tm to 94.8 °C, i.e. )3.5 °C compared with wild-type TmIDH. All residues in the cluster except Phe205 are conserved in PcIDH and HcIDH, which suggests that Phe205 plays a role in the increased thermal stability of TmIDH. Conclusions regarding thermostability The main differences in TmIDH compared with its mesophilic homologues were more ion pairs, larger ionic networks, an increased number of intersubunit ion pairs and stabilization of the N- and C-termini via long-range ionic interactions. Furthermore, we found a relative increase in hydrophobic residues and a more hydrophobic interface, whereas the accessible surface was less hydrophobic and more charged. The surfaceto-volume ratio was reduced slightly. With respect to earlier studies on thermostability, these differences are most likely important factors for enhanced thermostability. Site-directed mutagenesis and calorimetric measurements confirmed that stabilization of the N- and C-termini via electrostatic compensation and clustering of aromatic residues are vital for the stability of TmIDH. However, analysis of one mutant, R186M, demonstrated that the location of the ionic network and the local environment probably is essential, because the mutation did not affect the apparent Tm of TmIDH. Several properties of TmIDH were shared in common with ApIDH, which is the most thermostable IDH: stabilized N-terminus, more ion pairs and larger ionic networks, more hydrophobic residues in total, a more hydrophobic interface, a less hydrophobic accessible surface area and a decreased surface-tovolume ratio. However, TmIDH lacked interdomain

° ionic networks at a cut-off of 4.0 A and the size of the networks were not as dramatically increased at 4.2 and ° 6.0 A cut-offs like in ApIDH. By contrast, the number of intersubunit ion pairs was higher and the accessible surface was more charged in TmIDH.

Experimental procedures
Mutations and protein purification
Mutations in TmIDH were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used are listed in Table 3 and the mutation sites are underlined. Incorporation of the mutation at the desired position was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the entire idh-coding region using an ABI 3700 DNA sequencer. Mutated enzyme was produced in E. coli strain BL21-Codon-Plus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) as described previously for the recombinant wild-type enzyme and purified using heat treatment and Red-Sepharose chromatography [17]. The protein appeared as a single band on a SDS-acrylamide gel, however, two bands appeared on a native gel, corresponding to the dimeric and the tetrameric forms. The two oligomeric states were separated using a Superdex 200 16 / 60 gel filtration column.

Analytical ultracentrifugation
AUC experiments were performed on the recombinant wt TmIDH both before and after gel filtration (on the dimeric and tetrameric fractions separately) using a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France) equipped with a UV scanning system, using a fourhole AN-60 Ti rotor with double centrepieces of 1.20 cm path length. Two hundred absorbance profiles were recorded at 20 °C and 42 000 r.p.m., analysed using the sedfit program [62]. The calculation of the corrected sedimentation coefficient at 20 °C in water (s20,w) was performed as described previously [17].

Differential scanning microcalorimetric measurements
Differential scanning calorimetry was carried out on the dimeric fractions of purified recombinant wild-type TmIDH and the mutants with a MicroCal MCS calorimeter controlled using the mcs observer program (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The samples were dialysed against the reference buffer used in the experiment (50 mm potassiumphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm NaCl) and degassed for 20 min prior to the calorimetric analysis. A protein concentration of 1.5 mgÆmL)1 was used. The calorimetric scans were carried out between 20° and 120 °C using a scan rate of 1 KÆmin)1. A constant pressure of 2 bar was applied in order to avoid boiling at high temperatures. Each sample was scanned a second time after the actual calorimetric scan to estimate the reversibility of the unfolding transition.

Maps were initially calculated with phases obtained from a polyalanine model of porcine IDH with the separate domains positioned on the MR solution. Only nonconserved amino acids were changed to alanine. The sequence identity between TmIDH, PcIDH and HcIDH is 51.3 and 52.2%, respectively.

Crystallographic refinement, density modification and model building
The initial R-factor of the polyalanine model was 49.9% (Rfree 49.5%). The orientations of the two subunits and the domains were refined with rigid body refinement, decreasing the R-factor to 49.1% (Rfree 48.8%). Simulated annealing in CNS [66] was applied using torsion angles. The starting temperature was 3500°K and was decreased in steps of 25°K. The best results were obtained using tight NCS ° restraints (300 kcalÆmol)1ÆA)2) between the small domains and between the clasp domains and loose restraints (50 ° kcalÆmol)1ÆA)2) between the large domains. After grouped B-factor refinement in CNS, using one B-factor for each main-chain residue and one for each side chain, the R-factor dropped to 37.6% (Rfree 40.0%). Model building was performed with the program o [67] guided by weighted 2|Fo| ) |Fc| and |Fo| ) |Fc| maps. Each model building session was followed by TLS- and restrained refinement including isotropic B-factor refinement of the individual atoms with the program refmac5 [64]. The rigid TLS groups for anisotropic thermal motion were defined according to the domains of TmIDH. When subunit A was built, it was rotated over subunit B and adjusted according to the map. In some regions of subunit B, where the density was unclear, density-modified and averaged maps were used. Density modification and averaging according to the twofold noncrystallographic symmetry was done with the program dm. NCS restraints were optimized, taking into account possible differences due to crystal contacts. Some residues were built with two different conformations when negative |Fo| ) |Fc| density was present for a certain conformation and positive |Fo| ) |Fc| density for the other conformation and vice versa. Water molecules were added using the program arp_ warp [68] and kept only if density was present in both 2|Fo| ) |Fc| (if above 1 sigma) and |Fo| ) |Fc| maps (if above 3.0 sigma), if a suitable hydrogen bond donor / acceptor was present and if the temperature factor was below ° 65 A2. Some waters were added manually. The stereochemical quality of the models was checked with the program procheck [69] as implemented in ccp4 [64]. Superposition and determination of rmsd values between subunits, domains and homologous structures were performed with lsqman [70].

Crystallization, data collection and data processing
TmIDH was crystallized in 16% PEG 6000, 100 mm succinate buffer pH 6.0, 200 mm sodium acetate and 50 mm NaCl by using the vapour diffusion method and sitting drops at 291 K. 2.5 lL of 18 mgÆmL)1 protein was added to an equal volume of the reservoir solution. Crystals appeared after a few days and grew to a typical dimension of 0.2 · 0.2 · 0.5 mm. Data were collected at the synchrotron beamline I711 at MAXLAB (Lund, Sweden). The crystal was flash-frozen with boiling nitrogen at 100 K in the presence of 20% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant. A MarCCD 165 detector and marccd v. 0.5.33 software were used for data collection. The data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the hkl package [63]. Simulated precession pictures of the intensity data in space group P1, showed Laue mmm symmetry and the systematic extinctions following h ¼ 2n, k ¼ 2n and l ¼ 2n pointed to space group P212121. The dataset was completed by including all possible hkls and Rfree columns using unique [64]. Structure factors were calculated with the program truncate [64]. Data collection parameters and processing statistics are given in Table 1. The Matthews' coefficient (Vm) was ° 2.7 A3ÆDa)1 suggesting a dimer in the asymmetric unit.

Molecular replacement
Phase information was obtained in space group P212121 by molecular replacement with the program phaser [65] using ° data up to 2.5 A. The different domains of IDH were searched for separately because of different domain orientations found in other IDH crystal structures. The rotation and the position of the dimer of the small domains, including the clasp domain, were located using the equivalent domains of the porcine mitochondrial IDH structure (PDB entry 1LWD) as search model. The large domains were

Domains were considered as rigid bodies. Domain rotations were defined as the rotation angle required to superimpose the large domain in subunit A on the same domain in subunit B, with the small domains of subunit A and B remaining in a fixed superimposed position. Rotation angles were calculated from the O rotation matrix by convrot (W. Meining, unpublished). No significant translation component was detected. A structure-based sequence alignment was performed with the program stamp [71] and was based on the Ca-atom coordinates and secondary structural assignments made using the program dssp [72].

Surface and volume calculations and analysis of noncovalent interactions
Ion pairs and ionic networks were analysed using the programs contact [64] and ionstat (W. Meining, unpub° lished) with a maximum distance of 4 [55], 6 or 8 A. Accessible surface areas were calculated using CNS [66]. Ser-OG, Thr-OG1, Tyr-OH, Trp-NE1, Cys-SG, Asn-OD1, Asn-ND2, Gln-OE1, Gln-NE2, Arg-NE atoms and all main chain O and N atoms were defined as polar atoms. LysNZ, Arg-NH1, Arg-NH2, His-ND1, His-NE2, Asp-OD1, Asp-OD2, Glu-OE1, Glu-OE2, OXT were treated as charged atoms. All other atoms were treated as hydropho° bic. The water probe radius was 1.4 A. Built water molecules were excluded from the model. The water-accessible volumes of the structures were calculated with voidoo [73] ° using a water probe radius of 1.4 A. Hydrogen bonds were calculated using hbplus v. 3.15 [74] and the following default parameters: maximum distan° ° ces for D­A, 3.9 A and for H­A, 2.5 A; minimum angles for D­H­A, D­A­AA and H­A­AA were 90° [75].

Figure preparations
Figures 2 and 5 were made using pymol [76]. Figure 3 was prepared using the program alscript [77].
