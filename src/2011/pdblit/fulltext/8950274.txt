Abstract [Cu(bapp)ClO4 ]þ (1) and [Cu(bapp)Cl]þ (2) were prepared by the reaction of 1,4-bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine (bapp) with copper acetate and copper chloride in the presence of sodium perchlorate, respectively, and structurally characterized. Complex 1 has a square-pyramidal geometry, whereas [Cu(3,2,3-tet)(ClO4 )]þ (A) has a polymeric octahedral geometry in its X-ray crystal structure. Complex 1 is stable against disproportionation, whereas complex A is unstable in the mono-valent Cu(I) state. An aqua ligand on complex 1 in aqueous solution is substituted by NO with kinetic constants of kf ¼ 43 Æ 2 MÀ1 sÀ1 and kb ¼ ð8:8 Æ 0:2Þ Â 10À2 sÀ1 at 25 °C, whereas there were no spectral changes observed for complex A in saturated NO solution.

1. Introduction Cu(II) complexes of non-cyclic tetraamines have been studied with respect to their X-ray structure, crystal engineering, thermodynamic properties, and their reactivity [1­14]. These tetraamines can occupy four coordination sites on the Cu(II) ion with various structural modes. Thus, it is meaningful to elucidate the relation between the nature of the ligands and the structure, properties and reactivity of the complexes. Recently, some of us reported the X-ray structure and properties of [Cu(3,2,3-tet)(ClO4 )]þ (A), which formed a coordination polymer (B) bridged by a l-bidentate perchlorate ligand [1]. In this work, an attempted preparation was carried out to obtain another polymeric complex using bapp as a chelate, where bapp is 1,4-bis(3-aminoproSupplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.ica.2004.02.019. * Corresponding author.

pyl)piperazine. However, we obtained the products [Cu(bapp)ClO4 ]þ (1) and [Cu(bapp)Cl]þ (2), which have square-pyramidal geometries. Preparation and properties of complexes 1 and 2 are discussed along with the Xray crystal structures. Substitution reactions of the aqua ligand on A and 1 in aqueous solution by nitric oxide (NO), were studied kinetically and are discussed.

2. Experimental 2.1. Materials and methods All chemicals used in the syntheses were of reagent grade. Reagents for spectrochemical and electrochemical studies were purified according to the literature [15]. IR spectra were recorded on a Midac Prospect FT-IR spectrometer. Electronic absorption spectra were measured with a SCINCO 2000 PDA spectrophotometer. Molar conductivities were measured with a Jenway 4020 conductivity meter. Elemental analyses were performed

at the Korean Advanced Research Institute of Chemistry. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a BAS CW-50 potentiostat in oxygen-free 0.1 mol cmÀ3 (tBu)4 NClO4 acetonitrile solution at 25 °C. The pH of solutions was measured by employing a WTW PMX 500 pH meter with an Ingold combined glass electrode. Doubly distilled water was used for the preparation of the aqueous solution for kinetic studies. Sodium perchlorate was recrystallized from hot water. 2.2. Preparation

of 5­35 °C. Each temperature was maintained within Æ0.1 °C. The pH of the [Cu(bapp)(H2 O)]2þ solution was adjusted with 0.05 M TRIS (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) and HClO4 to 7.50 Æ 0.02. The stock solution of nitric oxide was prepared by saturation of water with nitric oxide under a nitrogen atmosphere. pKa values of the complexes were obtained by spectrophotometric titration. Caution! Perchlorate salts should be handled with great caution, as they are potentially explosive. 2.4. Crystal structure determination

Complex 1; 97% Bapp (1.0 g, 4.9 mmol) was added to 50 ml aqueous solution of Cu(OAc)2 Á H2 O (1.0 g, 4.9 mmol) under stirring. The solution was filtered and an excess amount of sodium perchlorate dissolved in water was added to the filtrate. Purple-red crystals were formed in a few hours at room temperature. The crystals were filtered off, washed with methanol, and recrystallized from hot water. Yield: $80%. Anal. Calc. for C10 H24 Cl2 CuN4 O8 : C, 25.95; H, 5.23; N, 12.11.

Kinetics Kinetic investigations of the substitution of water on [Cu(bapp)(H2 O)]2þ by nitric oxide were performed on an Applied Photophysics Model SX-18 MV stoppedflow instrument at 568 nm, thermostated over the range

Purple-red (1) and violet (2) crystals, isolated from aqueous solution, were mounted on a thin glass fiber and intensity data were collected on an Enraf­Nonius CAD4 Diffractometer equipped with monochromated  Mo Ka (k ¼ 0:71073 A) radiation. Unit cell parameters were determined from a least square-fit of 25 accurately centered reflections (22:92 < 2h < 31:01) for 1 and 19:48 < 2h < 27:63 for 2). These dimensions including conditions for data collection, are summarized in Table 1. Data were collected at 293 K in the x­2h scan mode. The structures were solved by the direct method using the S H E L X S -86 program [16] and refined on F 2 by full-matrix least-squares using the S H E L X L -97 program [17]. Heavy atoms (Cu and Cl) were located by use of heavy atom method. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined. All hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms were included in calculated positions. The other hydrogens (N­H) included in  located positions with U ¼ 0:07 A2 . A final difference Fourier map revealed several random features (<0.562   e AÀ3 for 1 and <0.85 e AÀ3 for 2).

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Crystal structures of 1 and 2 The ORTEP drawings of complexes 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, with the atomic labeling for non-hydrogen atoms. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table 2. The geometry around the Cu(II) ion of 1 is defined as a square-pyramid with a square-planar arrangement of the four nitrogen atoms in the bapp ligand and oxygen atoms of the perchlorate ions (O1 in Fig. 1) lying on an apical site of the plane. The geometry around the Cu(II) ion of 2 is also square-pyramidal with a chloride ion lying on an apical site of the plane. Generally, five-coordinate structures of Cu(II) lie on the Berry pathway [18] and methods that describe the degree of distortion have been developed [19,20]. The ratio of two basal angles in a square-pyramidal structure, s, defined as s ¼ ½ðh À UÞ=60 Â 100, represents the percentage trigonal distortion from a square-pyramidal geometry. The relevant angles in 1, h ¼ 169:6° and U ¼ 167:0°, respectively, yield s ¼ 4:30%, which indicates that the geometry of the complex is almost a regular square-pyramid by this description. 1 The relevant angles in 2, h ¼ 158:8° and U ¼ 156:2°, yield s ¼ 4:33%. Selected
1 s is 0 for ideal square-pyramid while s is 100 for trigonalbipyramid.

structural data of the complexes is given in Table 3. The average Cu­N bond distances of the complexes are   2.012(5) A (1) and 2.037(3) A (2), respectively. The bond  distances of Cu­O in 1 is 2.548(7) A and that of Cu­Cl in 2  The Cu­N bond distances of the comis 2.4607(11) A. plexes are consistent with those of square-pyramidal Cu(II) complexes of tetraamines [21­23]. The Cu­N(tertiary) bond distances are somewhat longer than the Cu­ N(primary) bond distances. This result indicates that primary nitrogen atoms donate more electron density to the Cu(II) ion than tertiary nitrogen, even if the tertiary nitrogen is inductively more basic. This weaker basicity of

3.2. Properties of the complexes The copper(II) complexes are soluble in water, methanol, acetonitrile, nitromethane, etc., while insoluble in benzene, chloroform, toluene, etc. The spectral and conductance data of the complex are listed in Table 3. IR spectra of the complex 1 show m(N­H) at 3312 and 3265 cmÀ1 , and for complex 2 at 3331 and 3273 cmÀ1 . The m(ClO4À ) of 1 occurs around 1100 cmÀ1 and is split into three peaks, indicating that the symmetry of the perchlorate ions is lowered from Td to C3v by complex formation [26]. The degenerate vibrations split and three modes appear in the infrared spectrum around 1100 cmÀ1 . Absorption maxima of the complexes 1 and 2 occur at 541 and 559 nm, respectively, which are in agreement with a d­d transition of the Cu(II) ion with a d9 configuration of the square-pyramidal geometry in the solid [27,28]. The absorption maxima of the complexes in nitromethane are the same as those of in the solid. However, spectra recorded in water exhibit shifts to longer wavelength, viz. 562 nm. The molar conductances of the complexes in water are 216 and 246 XÀ1 cmÀ2 molÀ1 , respectively, indicating the presence of 1:2 electrolytes. These results indicate that the anionic ligands (perchlorate and chloride) are displaced by an aqua ligand in water as solvent. The complex 1 has two irreversible reduction peaks at )0.11 and )0.24 V vs Ag/AgCl as reference electrode in 0.1 M TBAP acetonitrile solution, whereas complex A shows one irreversible peak at )0.42 V. These electrochemical data indicate that complex 1 is stable against disproportionation when it is reduced to Cu(I). This may be caused by the weaker donor properties of the bapp li-

tertiary nitrogen atoms is caused by back strain of tertiary amines with bulky groups [24]. Therefore, steric hindrance in the complex with tertiary amine ligands results in elongation of the metal-nitrogen bonds [10,25]. The complex 1 is prolonging along the a-axis by the repeat of square-pyramidal [Cu(bapp)ClO4 ]þ units with a weak electrostatic interaction between oxygen atom of perchlorato ligand and copper(II) ion of the next unit,

Also, the lack of hydrogen bonding of tertiary amines may increase the charge valence of Cu(I) ion and stabilize the low valent Cu(I) complex [29]. As a result, we are performing the isolation of the [Cu(bapp)]þ complex by the reaction of 1 with Cu powder in the presence of bapp ligand (reaction (1), L ¼ bapp) [10,30]. ½CuðLÞþ þ Cuð0Þ þ L ! 2½CuðLÞ2þ 3.3.

However, the pKa value of the aqua ligand in A was found to be >14. Thus we adopted a pH 7.5 for both complexes to carry out kinetic study on the substitution of the aqua ligand by NO. There was a considerable spectral change for 1 in a saturated aqueous NO solution (absorption maximum changed to shorter wavelength (551 nm) with a considerable decrease of extinction coefficient of 102 MÀ1 cmÀ1 ), whereas no spectral changes were observed for A in a saturated aqueous NO solution. The observed first-order rate constants in the presence of an excess of 1, kobs , depend linearly on the concentration of [Cu(bapp)(H2 O)]2þ (see Fig. 5) with kf ¼ 43 Æ 2 MÀ1 sÀ1 and kb ¼ ð8:8 Æ 0:2Þ Â 10À2 sÀ1 at

operation of an associative substitution mechanism, similar to that found for water exchange and complexformation reactions of other five-coordinate Cu(II) complexes [8,33,34]. Although the activation entropies are subjected to large error limits, the close to zero values seem to support the operation of an associative interchange mechanism. No spectral changes were observed for complex A in saturated NO solution, which must be attributed to the low stability of the corresponding nitrosyl complex. A number of cases of NO substitution studies have been reported in the literature focusing on the interaction with Co(II)/(III) and Fe(II)/(III) complexes of phthalocyanine or porphyrin [35­39]. More recently, many studies have been performed on biologically relevant complexes of Co and Fe, and the formal of coordination mode of NO was studied in detail [40]. This work is the first example of the study on substitution with NO in Cu(II) complex of a non-cyclic tetraamine ligand system. We are presently extending the kinetic study on the substitution of aqua ligand by NO for other Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes of non-cyclic tetraamines.
