Abstract The crystal structure of lanthanum orthovanadate LaVO4 has been refined by the Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray data. The structure is monoclinic, space group P21/n (a non-standard setting of P21/c No. 14), with a = 7.0434(1) Å; b = 7.2801(1) Å; c = 6.7224(1) Å;  = 104.864(1)°, V = 332.51(9) Å3, Z = 4, Dx = 5.07 g cm- 3. The present results are in good agreement with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction results. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Rare earth compounds of stoichiometery RBO4, where R is a rare earth and B is transition element, are well known for their wide ranging physical properties. Among these materials, rare earth vanadates form a group of compounds revealing interesting structural and magnetic transformations at very low temperatures [1] and a few are exceptional in that they undergo Jahn­Teller distortion [2]. These materials are also being studied for cathode luminescent materials, theromphosphores and scintillators [3]. Lanthanum orthovanadates, LaVO3 and LaVO4 have recently gained interest due to their surface catalytic properties and binary oxides of vanadium have been proposed as catalysts for vapour phase dehydrogenation of parafins [4,5]. Doped lanthanum vanadates such as LaxSr1-xVO3 have been extensively studied for their structural, magnetic and conductive properties [6­9] whereas vanadates containing V5+ have been extensively studied during the last few years for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, butane and ethylbenzene [10­12]. More recently Trikalitis et al. [13] have studied the reduced and oxidised lanthanum vanadates doped with strontium for their surface catalytic properties. Despite so much interest in lanthanum orthovanadate LaVO4, the information regarding its structure available in the

literature is scarce and contradictory. For example, Baran and Aymonino [14] from their X-ray powder studies found it to be monoclinic with space group P21/m (No.11) whereas Rice and Robinson [15] from single crystal investigation reported it to be monoclinic with space group P21/n (No.14) isostructural with monazite (CePO4). On the other hand, Escobar and Baran [16], Gaur et al. [17] and Oka et al. [18] reported it to be having tetragonal structure, crystallising in zircon-type structure (ZrSiO4) with space group I41/amd (No. 141). There is also controversy about the O coordination about lanthanum. Brusset et al. [19] reported lanthanum atom to be coordinated by eight oxygen atoms whereas Rice and Robinson [15] claimed that La exhibits an irregular coordination by nine O atoms. Crystal structure determination is in general a prerequisite for the rational understanding of the solid state properties of new materials. Even though single crystal diffractometry is the method of choice when it comes to crystal structure determination, this approach is often impractical because of the difficulties involved in growing single crystals of appropriate size. High quality powder samples, on the other hand, are much easier to obtain. Secondly, innovations in diffraction instrumentation and data analysis methods and software are such that reliable estimates of structural parameters can be obtained from powder diffraction techniques when single crystal are not available or hard to grow. Structure refinement using the whole pattern fitting or Rietveld method [20] is a powerful technique for extracting structural information from powder diffraction

amounts of 99.99% La2O3 and V2O5 was first heated at 1000 °C for 17 h followed by two 13 h heating at 1200 °C with intermediate grinding after each step. Once the single-phase material was obtained, it was annealed at 1250 °C for 17 h to improve the crystallinity. The powder diffraction pattern measurements were carried out with a Rigaku RINT2000 diffractometer in the Bragg­ Brentano geometry. Cu K radiation monochromatised by a graphite monochromator was used to measure the diffraction pattern. The measurements were performed at room temperature in step scan mode over the angular range of 5  2  135° with a step size of 0.02°. The measurement time per step was 2 s. 3. Data analysis The structural refinement was carried out using a PC version of profile refinement programme LH-RIET-6 [21,22]. The background was defined by a four order polynomial in 2 and

was refined simultaneously with other structural and profile parameters. A pure Voigt peak shape function (convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian) was employed to model the peak profiles. For diminishing the severe peak overlap, intensities within six times of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) were considered to contribute to a particular reflection. The angular dependence of FWHM of Gaussian component of peak shape function was refined with three parameters using the formula of Caglioti et al. [23] whereas FWHM of contributing Lorentzian component describes the particle size effect. All peaks were corrected for asymmetry effects after Howard [24]. As a starting point of the refinement, structural parameters were taken from Rice and Robinson [15] in space group P21/n that is a non-standard setting of P21/c (No.14). A total of 35 parameters were refined which included four background parameters, the instrument zero point, six profile parameters, cell dimensions, scale factor, fractional atomic coordinates and thermal parameters of each atom in their respective valence state. The simultaneous refinement of thermal factors of atoms tended to give negative values for some of the atoms that probably arise due to neglect for micro absorption correction and surface roughness [25]. Consequently, the intensities were corrected for microabsorption and surface roughness employing the model of Hermann and Ermrich [26]. The preferred orientation (001) correction due to presence of platy crystallites in the sample was carried out according to Dollase [27].
4. Results and discussion The refined X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 1. In the same figure, satisfactory matching of experimental with calculated values of X-ray data can be appreciated from the curve shown at the bottom of figure that corresponds to the difference between the observed and calculated diffraction patterns. The refined unit cell parameters and unit cell volume along with those available in literature are listed in Table 1 whereas fractional atomic coordinates along with the agreement indices are given in Table 2. Based on these refinements, it is found that contrary to the claims of Escobar and Baran [16], and Gaur et al. [17], the LaVO4, crystallises in monoclinic monazite structure and in agreement with Rice and Robinson [15]. The monozaite structure is a somewhat flexible MXO4 structure type containing approximately tetrahedral XO4 units and M cations with irregular, usually nine-fold co-ordination. Compounds like SrSeO4, PbCrO4, LaPO4, LaAsO4 and ThSiO4, BiAsO4 crystallise in this structure type [28,29]. The probable cause of the controversy regarding the different crystal structures reported in the literature is different routes adopted and starting materials utilised for the preparation of LaVO4. Oka et al. [18] successfully applied hydrothermal methods for the synthesis of zircon type LaVO4 and reported that the type of structure adopted by LaVO4 depends upon the choice of La source. Regardless of V source, La(NO3)3 always produced monazite type LaVO4 whereas LaCl3 and La(SO4)3 produced mainly zircon type structure, along with small amount of monazite-type LaVO4 [18]. As Escobar and Baran [16] had adopted similar procedure and materials, for the synthesis of LaVO4, it is not surprising that they obtained zircon type LaVO4. As can be seen in Fig. 2, each vanadium atom is at the centre of distorted tetrahedron of oxygen atoms with V­O distances ranging from 1.6191(9) to 1.9827(7) Å. La exhibits an irregular coordination by nine oxygen atoms in the range of 2.0459(9) to 2.9073(7) Å (Fig. 2)

which is contrary to the findings of Oka et al. [18] who reported the lanthanum atom to be coordinated by eight oxygen atoms and in agreement with Rice and Robinson [15] who claimed that it to be nine. Each lanthanum atom is coordinated with two vanadium atoms at 3.3321(6) and 3.38974) Å. There are four oxygen atoms around each vanadium atoms in tetragonal arrangement which is considerably distorted (V­O = 1.6191(9) to 1.9827(7) Å and O­V­O angles of 92.55(5)° to 123.31(5)°. Pertinent bond distances for LaVO4 are given in Table 3.

5. Conclusion The present study concludes that LaVO4 is monoclinic with space group P21/n with tetra-molecular cell and not tetragonal as reported by Escobar and Baran [16]. Although, the unit cell parameters, intensities and inter-planar spacing of stronger reflections given by Baran and Aymonino [14] are in agreement with present study, however, the X-ray diffraction data reported here also includes a number of lines that are not listed in [14]. This is understandable because different space groups have been utilised by Baran and Aymonino [14]. References
