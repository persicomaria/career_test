Background: Homologous recombination is crucial for genetic diversity and repairing damaged chromosomes. In Escherichia coli cells, the RuvA, RuvB and RuvC proteins participate in the processing of an important intermediate, the Holliday junction. The RuvA­RuvB protein complex facilitates branch migration of the junction, depending on ATP hydrolysis. The atomic structure of RuvA should enable critical questions to be addressed about its specific interactions with the Holliday junction and the RuvB protein. Results: The crystal structure of RuvA shows the tetrameric molecules with a fourfold axis at the center. Each subunit consists of three distinct domains, some of which contain important secondary structure elements for DNA binding. Together with the detailed structural information, the biochemical assays of various mutant RuvA proteins and domains, isolated by partial proteolysis, allowed us to define the functional roles of these domains in Holliday junction binding and the RuvB interaction. Conclusions: The RuvA molecule is formed by four identical subunits, each with three domains, I, II and III. The locations of the putative DNA-binding motifs define an interface between the DNA and the Holliday junction. Domain III is weakly attached to the core region, comprising domains I and II; the core domains can form a tetramer in the absence of domain III. Functional analyses of the mutant proteins and the partial digestion products, including Holliday junction binding and branch-migration assays, revealed that domain III and the preceding loop are crucial for RuvB binding and branch migration, although this region is not required for the junction­DNA binding.

Introduction
Homologous recombination is a crucial process, not only for generating genetic diversity but also for the repair of damaged chromosomes. An important intermediate of this cellular process is the Holliday junction, in which two homologous DNA duplexes are held together by a singlestranded crossover [1,2]. In the Escherichia coli chromosome, junctions are formed primarily by the function of the RecA protein, which promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange through the formation of helical nucleoprotein filaments. In the later stages of recombination, a set of three proteins, encoded by the ruv genes, is involved in the process to create the mature recombinant DNA molecules [2,3]. The tetrameric RuvA protein specifically binds the Holliday junction and targets the hexameric RuvB protein to the junction. The observation of the tripartite RuvA­ RuvB­junction complex by electron microscopy revealed that the two tetramers of RuvA form a symmetrical sandwich on the plane of the junction and that the two hexameric rings, facing front-to-front, contact both sides of the

tetrameric RuvA proteins [4,5]. Thus, the RuvA and RuvB proteins work in concert to facilitate the migration of the junction point [6,7]. This migration requires RuvB-dependent ATP hydrolysis [6,8]. In fact, RuvB shares conserved sequence motifs for ATP binding with various DNA and RNA helicases. RuvC resolves the Holliday junction into two unconnected recombinant DNA duplexes by nicking the sugar­phosphate backbone near the crossover junction point. This hydrolytic cleavage occurs at a preferred site with identical polarity and symmetry [9,10]. Subsequently, these nicked DNA duplexes are sealed by DNA ligase to produce two recombinant duplexes. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the macromolecular components of recombination is essential to obtain more detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms of homologous recombination. In combination with mutational analyses, the crystallographic study of RuvC provided important information about its specific interaction with the Holliday junction and the catalytic center for junction resolution [9,11]. More recently, the crystal structure determination of RuvA allowed the construction of a hypothetical model of

its complex with the Holliday junction [12]. This report describes the RuvA crystal structure, independently determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR), and discusses the functional model based on the combined use of X-ray, mutational and proteolytic analyses. Together with the detailed information of the 3D structure, the sitedirected mutagenesis and functional analyses of the RuvA domain structure allowed us to identify distinct regions important for DNA binding and association with RuvB, which is essential for branch migration.

center between  strand 1 and  strand 4, in addition to central hydrophobic and polar contacts (Figure 1). The second hydrophobic interface seems to connect domain III less strongly with the adjacent subunits (Figures 1 and 2). It is remarkable that this contact alone fixes domain III to the remaining major region of the tetramer.

Results and discussion
Crystal structure

The crystal structure of the RuvA protein has been determined at 2.5 Å resolution using MIR, which includes the anomalous scattering effect (Figure 1). The structure is essentially identical to the 1.9 Å resolution structure previously reported by Rafferty et al. [12], although the unitcell parameters are significantly different between the two crystals, which have the same P4 space group [13]. As reported by Rafferty et al. [12], the RuvA molecule consists of four identical subunits, which are related by the fourfold axis at the center of a concave­convex square plate (Figure 1). The structure of each L-shaped subunit is divided into three domains (Figure 2). The contact between domains I and II appears to be tight enough to fix their relative orientation. Domain III makes no direct contact with domains I and II within the same subunit, however, and a flexible loop, including an unstructured segment, isolates domain III from the remaining major region (Figure 1). The topological consideration of the entire backbone structure undoubtedly excludes possible connections, other than the present one, between domains II and III. As reported previously [12], the RuvA tetramer is maintained primarily by intersubunit hydrogen bonds near the

Based on the color display of the electrostatic potential of the protein surface, Rafferty et al. proposed a hypothetical model of RuvA complexed with the Holliday junction on the concave side [12]. This model shares the fourfold axis of the RuvA tetramer with the four-way DNA junction in the open-square configuration. The mainchain folding of domain I (Figures 1 and 2) is notably similar to the OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) fold [14,15], which is found in many singlestranded DNA-binding proteins, including human mitochondria SSB (single-stranded DNA-binding protein; [16]) and RPA (replication protein A; [17]). As found in the crystal structures of these proteins complexed with DNA, the  barrel of domain I possesses an outer surface covered by a cluster of aromatic residues (Figure 2), which may make stacking interactions with DNA bases. Rafferty et al. [12] mentioned that the negatively charged central `pin' facilitates the DNA strand separation. The aromatic residues on the OB fold (Figure 2) lie in close vicinity of this pin, and they may, therefore, also be involved in the disruption of some base pairs. Domain II contains two helix­hairpin­helix (HhH) motifs (Figure 2), which bind sugar­phosphate backbones of DNA [18]. Both these motifs are located at the bottom of the basic surface. Although the Holliday junction essentially lacks singlestranded DNA in the absence of interacting proteins, the binding of RuvA to the Holliday junction may open the junction and produce the single-stranded region through the interaction with the aromatic interface of domain I.

The N-terminal fragment, consisting only of domains I and II, can form a tetramer

The smaller C-terminal fragment produced by the endopeptidase could be separated completely by gel filtration from the remaining major N-terminal fragment (NH2 fragment) consisting of domains I and II (Figure 4a). The elution profile also revealed that the larger 16.4 kDa fragment forms a 66 kDa tetramer in solution, whereas the smaller fragment is present as a monomer. These results suggest that the hydrophobic contact is not strong enough to fix domain III to the adjacent subunit and the contact allows domain III to be occasionally released from the remaining major tetrameric region, although, in the crystal structure, domain III is fixed within the tetramer.

Light blue sidechains show notable aromatic and hydrophobic residues (His29, His50, Val52, Leu59 and Tyr61) on the OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) fold of domain I. Residues involved in the contact between domain III and the adjacent subunit are indicated by the gray sidechains (Pro14, Met32, Phe35, Leu113, Pro114 and Leu203). Mutation sites, such as Tyr36, Leu110, Leu167, Leu170, Tyr172 and Leu199, are shown by yellow sidechains. Note that the invariant residue, Leu110, is located within the second helix­hairpin­helix (HhH) in domain II, and that Tyr36 lies on the surface of domain I.

Domain analyses by limited proteolysis

The intact 22 kDa RuvA molecule was found to be spontaneously cleaved into two fragments during storage, possibly by a trace of contaminating proteinase. N-terminal sequence and mass spectroscopic analyses revealed that the intact molecule was split into an N-terminal 16.4 kDa fragment and a 5.7 kDa fragment. Partial digestion with the authentic endoproteinase AspN and subsequent analyses of products revealed that the cleavage site is located on the N-terminal side of Asp145 within the unstructured segment that connects domain III and the remaining two domains; -chymotrypsin cleaved between Leu148 and Ser149 in the same region (Figure 3a). The RuvA protein, complexed with a synthetic Holliday junction was cleaved with -chymotrypsin and endoproteinase AspN as efficiently as RuvA in the absence of DNA, indicating that DNA binding cannot prevent the proteolytic cleavage of the unstructured loop region (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the assumption that the Holliday junction is bound to the basic concave surface on the opposite side of the loop.

The ability of the NH2 fragment to bind to the Holliday junction was studied by a gel-shift assay. The NH2 fragment, which consists of only domains I and II, can bind a synthetic Holliday junction as efficiently as the intact RuvA molecule (Figure 4b). The results of the assay also strongly support the fact that domain III and the preceding flexible loop do not participate in DNA binding. Notably, both the intact molecule and the NH2 fragment formed two kinds of complexes with the Holliday junction, as revealed by two bands with different mobilities (Figure 4b). A similar result was previously reported for the intact RuvA molecule in complex with a synthetic Holliday junction [19], and the two complexes were designated as complex I and complex II, corresponding to the faster and slower migrating bands, respectively. It is very likely that complex I is composed of one tetramer of RuvA and one molecule of the Holliday junction, like the model proposed by Rafferty et al. [12], whereas complex II is formed by two tetramers and one Holliday junction molecule sandwiched between them, as suggested by an electron microscopic study [5]. Thus, we assume that even the NH2 fragment, which lacks domain III and a part of the flexible loop, could form both complexes I and II, although confirmation must await the direct determination of the complex structure to ascertain whether the fragment and the intact molecule bind the junction in the same manner.
Phenotypes and characterization of mutants

We constructed 40 mutants, in which various residues, particularly those conserved in a multiple alignment among the four bacterial RuvA homologs, were replaced by alanine. These mutation sites were mapped on the RuvA structure (Figure 3a). Six mutant genes showed the complete or partial loss of their ability to complement the phenotype of a ruvA deletion strain in vivo, when they were carried on a multiple-copy plasmid. On the other hand, the remaining 34 mutants exhibited the normal phenotype (data not shown). When expressed from a multiple-copy plasmid in the wild-type strain, four of the six mutants, Leu167Ala,

Leu170Ala, Tyr172Ala and Leu199Ala, exhibited dominant negative effects, suggesting that they retain some activity of RuvA, but lose other activity. Leu167, Leu170, Tyr172 and Leu199 were mapped onto the second subunit interfaces of domain III in the RuvA tetrameric structure (Figure 2). The Tyr36Ala protein partially complemented the UV sensitivity of the ruvA strain. Tyr36, which belongs to domain I of the adjacent subunit, lies in the marginal area of the interface, and thus the mutant protein may be partially defective in the interaction with the adjacent subunit (Figure 2). The last mutation site, Leu110, was located at an invariant position in the first  helix within the second HhH motif (Figure 2). This mutant was unable to complement the UV sensitivity, but it did not interfere with the wildtype ruvA function. We therefore suspect that this mutation would impair the Holliday junction binding activity. Six mutant proteins (Leu167Ala, Leu170Ala, Tyr172Ala, Leu199Ala, Tyr36Ala and Leu110Ala) were purified to examine their properties and functions in more detail.

We examined the oligomeric states of the mutants as well as that of the NH2 fragments. Low-angle rotary-shadowing electron microscopy revealed that three RuvA mutant proteins, Tyr36Ala, Leu110Ala and Leu170Ala have essentially the same tetrameric subunit morphology as that of the wild-type protein (Figure 5). Despite relatively poor images, electron micrographs also suggest a tetrameric morphology for the NH2 fragment (data not shown). No significant difference was observed in CD measurements between the wild type and either of the Leu110 Ala and Leu170Ala mutant proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, all the mutants were found to be crystallizable. On the other hand, the six mutant proteins showed chromatographic behaviors slightly different from the wild type. The RuvA crystal structure suggests that, except for Leu110Ala, the five mutations more or less disrupt the hydrophobic contact of domain III with the adjacent subunit, although they induce no substantial change in

their conformations. Thus, we presume that the differences in the chromatographic behaviors between the mutant and the wild-type proteins would be derived from the mobility of domain III enhanced by the mutations.
Binding of the mutant proteins with the Holliday junction

may be associated with the increased conformational flexibility of the mutant proteins, in agreement with the previous interpretation. In contrast, the Leu110Ala mutation caused the complete loss of the junction DNA-binding activity. As described above, this mutant retains the same tetrameric morphology and overall conformation as the wild type. The sidechain of Leu110, however, which occupies an invariant position in the first  helix within the HhH motif, makes intimate contacts with an alanine residue on the other  helix within the motif (Figure 2). Its replacement by the less bulky alanine may generate the minor local distortion of the motif, which leads to the abolishment of the junction­DNA binding.
Branch migration by the mutant proteins

Gel-mobility shift analysis, using purified mutant proteins and a synthetic Holliday junction, showed that Tyr36Ala, Leu167Ala, Leu170Ala, Tyr172Ala and Leu199Ala exhibited Holliday junction binding activity similar to that of the wild-type RuvA protein (Figure 6a). In fact, the titration experiment exhibited one primary shifted band, corresponding to the complex I reported by Whitby et al. [19], up to a fourfold excess in the molar ratio of the protein to the DNA. The second, slower migrating band, corresponding to complex II, appeared when the mutant proteins were added to the mixtures in a 10-fold excess to the DNA.

position, possibly corresponding to a tetramer or hexamer. The mixture of the wild-type RuvA and RuvB proteins eluted at a position of ~250 kDa, suggesting the formation of a RuvA­RuvB hetero-oligomeric complex, as reported previously [20]. Similarly, the elution profiles of the mutant proteins, as well as the truncated molecule with only domains I and II, were analyzed. The profiles revealed that the molecular masses of these proteins ranged from 130 kDa to 170 kDa in the absence of RuvB, except for the truncated protein (70 kDa). The results confirm that these RuvA mutant proteins retain the ability to form tetramers. Presumably, the apparent larger sizes of the mutant proteins would be due to the increased flexibility of the tetramer derived from the domain III mobility, as discussed in the previous section. None of the four domain III mutant proteins, Leu167Ala, Leu170Ala, Tyr172Ala and Leu199Ala, showed any shift in the elution positions by the addition of RuvB, indicating a complete loss of their RuvB-binding activity. On the other hand, the Leu110Ala protein was able to interact with RuvB. The Tyr36Ala mutation within domain I does not abolish the RuvB binding. Taken together, these results suggest that the structural disturbance of the second hydrophobic contact strongly correlates with the abolishment of the RuvB-binding property.

of RuvA in conjunction with RuvB to dissociate the synthetic Holliday junction, whereas Tyr36Ala retained full activity (Figure 6b). The Leu110Ala mutant protein, which cannot bind the Holliday junction, should lack the branch-migration activity as shown here. In the RuvA tetramer, Leu167, Leu170, Tyr172 and Leu199 are all located in the second hydrophobic interface of domain III with the adjacent subunits (Figure 2). Tyr36 lies in domain I and relatively far from the contact region with domain III, however. Similarly, the mutation at Arg200 does not affect the branch-migration activity. This result implies that branch-migration activity is strongly coupled with the structural maintenance of the interface between domain III and the adjacent subunit.
Abilities of mutant RuvA proteins to form homo-oligomers and complexes with the RuvB protein

The NH2 fragment, which lacks domain III and the preceding flexible loop, lost the RuvB-binding activity. Unexpectedly, a nick introduced by the endopeptidase at Asp145 within the unstructured segment deprived the RuvA molecule of the binding activity. It is possible that the nicking may cause the immediate release of domain III and the loop from the remaining major region of the RuvA tetramer.
Functional implications of domain III and its preceding flexible segment

What is the functional significance of this unique domain architecture? Notably, the structure, that includes domain III and the preceding flexible loop, appears to be strikingly mobile in comparison with the remaining domains I and II. This high mobility is exemplified by the large value, > 80 Å2, of the average temperature factor of the mainchain atoms (Figure 3b). The RuvB-binding activity is remarkably sensitive to proteolytic modification in this area, suggesting that this mobile region is crucial for the interaction with RuvB. Domain III is fixed to the NH2 fragment of the tetramer only through the weak hydrophobic interaction between domain III and the adjacent subunit. The isolated domain III showed a typical CD spectrum of the all- protein, suggesting that its conformational maintenance is independent of the remaining major region. Gel filtration analyses imply that domain III is released from the remaining major regions of domains I and II upon cleavage at the

In order to directly observe the interaction of the RuvA mutants with RuvB, we examined the gel filtration pattern of a mixture of RuvA and RuvB. As shown in Figure 7, the wild-type RuvA protein alone eluted at the 100 kDa position, corresponding to the tetramer, and likewise, the RuvB protein alone eluted at the 160 kDa

is in agreement with the remarkable mobility of domain III and its preceding loop. Leu167, Leu170, Tyr172 and Leu199 are located on the surface of domain III, and hence their replacements by

alanine are unlikely to seriously affect the conformational stability of domain III. In fact, there is no significant difference in the CD spectra between the wild type and Leu170Ala, indicating that this mutation causes no substantial change in the overall conformation. On the other hand, the mutation at Tyr36, lying in the marginal region of the interface, does not affect the binding activity of RuvA with RuvB. Thus, it is more likely that the abolishment of this binding activity is attributed to the disruption of the local but crucial contact between domain III and

the contiguous subunit, rather than the unfolding of domain III. The substitutions of alanine for the bulky hydrophobic residues in the interface would weaken the inter-subunit interaction, and hence they may shift the dynamic equilibrium to the released state of domain III. It is remarkable that these minor structural disturbances of the interface completely inhibit binding with RuvB. We suspected that the same interface of domain III could be involved in binding to RuvB. Gel filtration analyses

revealed that neither the isolated domain III nor the proteolytically cleaved RuvA molecule is bound to RuvB. Thus, it is likely that the contact between domain III and the contiguous subunit is directly required for the formation of the active RuvA­RuvB complex. The DNA-binding assay of the mutant proteins and the NH2 fragment demonstrated that domain III and the preceding flexible loop, which are crucial for the RuvB binding, are not involved in the RuvA­Holliday junction interaction. Indeed, this region is located outside the putative DNA-binding interface in the tetrameric crystal structure. The inability of the mutant proteins, Leu167Ala, Leu173Ala, Tyr172Ala and Leu199Ala, to bind RuvB and their ability to bind the junction DNA may account for the dominant-negative phenotype, because these mutant proteins may compete for the junction binding with the wild-type RuvA.

deletion of domain III causes the complete loss of RuvB-binding activity, whereas the Holliday junction binding activity remains intact. Mutations in the interface of domain III with the adjacent subunits specifically impair the RuvB-binding activity, although these mutants retain the junction-binding activity. These results suggest that domain III and the preceding flexible loop of RuvA are involved in the association with RuvB and the subsequent branch migration. This interaction with RuvB also appears to require the conformational flexibility of domain III. The multifunctional properties of RuvA appear to be closely associated with its unique subunit and domain structures, as revealed by the X-ray cystallographic structural analysis.

Materials and methods
Construction of mutant ruvA genes
The method of Kunkel et al. [21] was used to construct 40 alanine substituted mutants, using primers containing the intended mutations. Mutants that failed to complement or only partially complemented a ruvA deletion strain were selected by UV sensitivity analysis (data not shown). Expression of mutant and wild-type RuvA proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis using an anti-RuvA rabbit antibody and an ECL kit (Amersham).

Biological implications
The Holliday junction is an important DNA intermediate in homologous recombination. In the prokaryotic chromosomes, the three gene products RuvA, RuvB and RuvC are involved in the late stage of the recombination that processes the intermediate into mature recombinantDNA duplexes. The RuvA­RuvB complex catalyzes ATP hydrolysis and facilitates the migration of the Holliday junction, which is created primarily by the function of the RecA protein. The RuvC protein is an endonuclease that specifically resolves the junction. RuvA specifically binds to the four-way junction and recruits the RuvB helicase to the junction. Recent genetic and biochemical evidence has shown that the branch migration and resolution act in concert, suggesting the possible assembly of the RuvA, RuvB and RuvC proteins. Thus, it is important to elucidate the specific RuvA­Holliday junction and RuvA­RuvB interactions in terms of the final structure of the intact molecular machinery for DNA homologous recombination. The crystal structure of RuvA revealed that the 22 kDa subunit, divided into three unique domains, forms a tetramer. Domain I, nearest to the N terminus, folds into a  barrel, which represents a structural motif similar to that of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Domain II contains two helix­hairpin­helix motifs, which strongly implicates the interactions with sugar­ phosphate backbones. The motifs of domains I and II lie on the bottom of the putative basic interface with DNA. The tetrameric structure is primarily stabilized by intersubunit  sheets formed between different subunits. Domain III, completely isolated from domain I and II by the unstructured segment, makes minor hydrophobic contacts with the adjacent subunits. Proteolytic cleavage allows the release of domain III from the tetrameric NH2 fragments that consist of domain I and II. This

Preparation of RuvA protein
The RuvA protein was overexpressed in the E. coli strain HRS4000 -- BL21 (DE3) ruvABC (K Ishioka, unpublished observations) -- from the plasmid pAF134, containing the wild-type ruvA gene under T7 promoter control (A Fukuoh, unpublished observations), and was purified by the method of Shiba et al. [8] with a slight modification. The cells were lyzed by sonication and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. Polymine P was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.1%, to remove the DNA. The suspension was stirred for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and the proteins were precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT, and incubating overnight. The precipitates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min and the pellet was resuspended in TEG buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT) containing 500 mM NaCl. The suspension was dialyzed against the same buffer containing 300 mM NaCl. It was diluted tenfold and was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (500 ml). The column was developed with a 2 l linear gradient of 0 M to 1 M NaCl in TEG buffer. The RuvA protein was eluted at ~200 mM NaCl. The fractions were pooled, diluted 10-fold with TEG buffer (pH 7.5), and applied to a heparin column (200 ml). The column was developed with a 4 l linear gradient of 250 mM to 1 M NaCl. The RuvA protein was eluted at ~450 mM NaCl. The fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 150 mM KCl, and applied to a 50 ml hydroxyapatite column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was developed with a 400 ml linear gradient of 20 mM to 600 mM phosphate (pH 6.8). The RuvA protein was eluted in the fractions around 200 mM phosphate. It was purified to over 99% homogeneity, as determined by SDS-PAGE. To prepare the mutant RuvA proteins that bound inefficiently to DEAE Sepharose, various modifications were made. After the Polymine P treatment, the crude extracts were applied to an SP Sepharose column, which was developed with a linear gradient of 0 mM to 500 mM KCl. The fractions containing RuvA were applied to a hydroxyapatite column and the proteins were eluted in the same way as the wild-type RuvA. For mutant proteins with high affinity for heparin, a heparin column was used for further purification. Throughout the entire purification process, a phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was used. For later purifications of the wild-type RuvA protein, this purification protocol was used to avoid the cleavage of RuvA during the ammonium sulfate precipitation and the DEAE column

step. The RuvA protein containing selenomethionine was produced as described by Hendrickson et al. [22] with a slight modification. E. coli strain B834 (DE3) met, carrying pAF134, was grown in M9 media supplemented with the required nutrients. When the cells reached an OD600 of 0.2, they were harvested, washed twice with M9 salts, and resuspended in M9 medium lacking methionine. The cells were cultured for 30 min to deplete the intracellular methionine pool. After IPTG (0.4 mM) and selenomethionine (40 µg/ml) were added, the cells were cultured for 3­4 h and were harvested. The purification of the selenomethioninelabeled RuvA was carried out by the same procedure as that for the native RuvA, except for the use of buffers containing 5 mM DTT, instead of 1 mM, to prevent selenium oxidation. The incorporation of selenium (> 95%) was checked by amino acid composition analysis using a Beckman 6300 analyzer.

Crystallization of RuvA protein
The RuvA crystals were grown at 20°C, in a solution containing 50 mM citrate (pH 4.8), 1 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol, by the microdialysis method. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000 was added gradually, and thin crystals usually appeared at a 3­3.5% PEG concentration. A typical crystal size was 100 µm × 100 µm × 1,000 µm. For the harvest of the crystals and the heavy atom search, the PEG concentrations were increased to 5% under the above conditions.

using data from 6.0 Å to 3.0 Å. The data for REFMAC ranged from 20.0 Å to 2.8 Å. No solvent mask was used in the refinement. At the initial stage, a combination of the MIRAS phase and the model phase was used for the refinement, and only the overall B factor was refined. At this stage, the free R factor of the model was 37.9% for the data between 20 Å and 2.8 Å. Further refinements, including the individual B factors, lowered the conventional R factor to 21.7% and the free R factor to 30.6%. Subsequent refinements, including the placement of 19 water molecules, provided final values of 23.9% and 29.3% for the conventional and free R factors, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). Throughout the entire refinement process, free R factors were monitored as a guideline. For the modification of the protein model, QUANTA version 1996 was used. The average B factors for the mainchain atoms and for all non-hydrogen atoms, including sidechains, are 60.5 Å2 and 63.4 Å2, respectively, and 49.0 Å2 for the water molecules. The electron density of amino acid residues 141­157 was hardly discernible at the final 2.5 Å resolution electron-density map, presumably because of the structural disorder. The present structure contains 186 amino acids and 19 water molecules. The Ramachandran map evaluated from the model by PROCHECK showed that 89.9% of the residues are in the most favorable region, 10.1% are in the favored region, and none is in the disallowed region, except for proline and glycine residues.

Limited proteolysis Diffraction data collection and processing
The RuvA crystals belong to the space group P4, with unit cell dimensions a = 83.73 Å, b = 83.73 Å and c = 34.03 Å, and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.71 Å3/Da). The crystal diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution at room temperature. X-ray diffraction data were collected by the use of three imaging plate diffractometers, MAC Science DIP100, DIP320 and DIP2030, depending upon circumstances. Synchrotron radiation was also used to collect higher resolution data on the beam line BL6B at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba). The collected data were indexed by the DENZO program and each frame was scaled by the program SCALEPACK [23] without any sigma cutoffs. The CCP4 program suite [24] was used for scaling between native data and heavy atom derivative data and for the phase determination. Heavy-atom positions and occupancies were refined using MLPHARE from the same program suite [24]. From the difference Patterson and difference Fourier maps, we identified a major site of the K2HgI4 derivative, as well as six selenium atoms from a recombinant selenomethionine derivative. The combination of the two derivatives provided interpretable 3.0 Å MIRAS (multiple isomorphous replacement anomalous scattering) electron density maps, from which an initial protein model was built by the use of QUANTA. RuvA was treated with a 1:100 molar ratio of endoproteinase AspN (Boehringer Mannheim) and -chymotrypsin (Sigma) in 20 mM HEPES­NaOH (pH 7.5), for 30 min and 60 min, respectively, at 20°C. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. Gel filtration chromatography of the digested material was performed at 4°C on a Superdex 75 PC3.2/30 SMART column (Pharmacia) for the analytical scale, and a Superdex 75 HR32/ 30 column (Pharmacia) for the preparative scale.

N-terminal amino acid sequencing and molecular mass analysis
The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the proteolytic fragments were determined, using an Applied Biosystems AB492 automated protein sequencer. The molecular masses were determined on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDITOF MS; Perseptive) using a matrix of -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid.

Low-angle rotary-shadowing electron microscopy
The proteins were sprayed onto a freshly cleaved mica surface by using a painter's air brush, and were immediately placed into an evaporator optimized for freeze-etching replicas (Hitachi FR 7000). The samples were dried for 10 min while cooled from room temperature to ­100°C, rotary-shadowed with platinum, using an electron gun positioned at 2.5° to the mica surface, and then coated with a film of carbon. The replicas were collected on a grid covered with formvar film. Each protein replica was observed with a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Most of the images were photographed at

Structure refinement
The X-PLOR version 3.1 [25] and REFMAC programs (CCP4 program suite version 3.1 [24]) were used to refine the protein model and the phases. Initial positional refinement was followed by simulated annealing,

Gel-shift and branch-migration analyses of mutant proteins
Four 72-mer DNA oligonucleotides (BEX Co., Ltd) were mixed at an equimolar ratio, and the immobile synthetic Holliday junction was prepared by heat and annealing, as described previously [7]. One of the oligonucleotides was labeled at the 5 end, prior to annealing, using [-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Binding reaction mixtures (20 µl) contained ~5 nM 32P-labeled Holliday junction DNA, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 1.4 µg BSA, and 5% glycerol. The DNA and the protein were incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Reaction mixtures were directly applied to a 4% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (40 mM Trisacetate, 1 mM EDTA), and electrophoresis was performed at 160 V at room temperature. The gels were dried and the DNA bands were visualized by using a bioimage analyser (Fuji). For the branch migration reaction, 1 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2 were added to the above mixture, and the DNA and the protein were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The molar ratio between RuvA and RuvB was kept at 1:6. SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.1% to remove the bound proteins. The reaction products were analyzed as described above.

Gel filtration analysis
Gel filtration was carried out at 10°C on a Superdex 200 PC3.2/30 column attached to a SMART chromatographic system (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 50 mM NaCl. For each experiment, 20 µl sample with an ~1:2 molar ratio of RuvA and RuvB was applied. Prior to loading, the sample was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. For the estimation of the molecular weights, Bio-Rad molecular marker kit was used, which contained bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Accession numbers
