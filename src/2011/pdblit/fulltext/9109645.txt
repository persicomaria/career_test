The structural transition in troponin C induced by the binding of two calcium ions involves an "opening" of the structure, an event that triggers skeletal muscle contraction. We have solved the solution structure of a mutant (E41A) of the regulatory domain of skeletal troponin C wherein one bidentate ligand to the calcium in site I is missing. This structure remains "closed" upon calcium binding, indicating that the linkage between calcium binding and the induced conformational change has been broken. This provides a snapshot of skeletal troponin C between the off and on state and thereby valuable insight into the mechanism of regulation within skeletal TnC. Although several factors contribute to the triggering mechanism, the opening of the troponin C structure is ultimately dependent on one amino acid, Glu41. Insights into the structure of cardiac troponin C can also be derived from this skeletal mutant.

ABSTRACT:

Muscle contraction is initiated by the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggering a cascade of events involving several protein structural changes and altered protein-protein interactions (Leavis & Gergely, 1984; Zot & Potter, 1987; Ohtsuki et al., 1986; Farah & Reinach, 1995). In vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscle, the conformational change in TnC1 resulting from Ca2+ binding is the first event in contraction. This response is then passed to other components of the thin filament and ultimately leads to muscle contraction. TnC is a small acidic protein (18 kDa) consisting of two similar globular domains (NTnC and CTnC), each containing two Ca2+ binding sites. CTnC contains metal binding sites III and IV (high affinity Ca2+/ Mg2+ sites), which are always filled in muscle cells, and primarily assumes a structural role. In skeletal muscle, NTnC contains calcium binding sites I and II, which are lower affinity Ca2+-specific sites, and carries out the regulatory function. In cardiac muscle, NTnC binds Ca2+ in site II only, as site I is defunct (Tobacman, 1996). Although the crystal structure of avian skeletal TnC was first solved a decade ago (Herzberg & James, 1988; Satyshur et al., 1988), the structure of the calcium-loaded regulatory domain was first reported last year (Gagne et al., 1995; ´ Slupsky & Sykes, 1995). This provided an experimental structural description of the skeletal muscle contraction switch and confirmed the validity of the proposed model (Herzberg et al., 1986). The structural transition in the regulatory domain of skeletal TnC on Ca2+ binding involves

an opening of the domain through a large change in interhelical angles (Figure 1). This leads to the increased exposure of an extensive hydrophobic patch (Gagne et al., ´ 1995; Slupsky & Sykes, 1995; Herzberg et al., 1986). Although the structures of the 0Ca-NTnC (Herzberg & James, 1988; Satyshur et al., 1988; Gagne et al., 1995) and ´ 2Ca-NTnC (Gagne et al., 1995; Slupsky & Sykes, 1995; ´ Strynadka et al.2) are available, the detailed mechanism of the linkage between Ca2+ binding and this Ca2+-induced structural change is still unclear. We present in this paper the 3D solution structure of a Ca2+-bound mutant of the N-domain of skeletal TnC (2CaE41A-NTnC) in which one of the ligands to the Ca2+ in site I is missing. This structure is a snapshot of TnC between the off (-Ca2+) and on (+Ca2+) state and therefore provides valuable insight into the mechanism of regulation within skeletal TnC, that is, the coupling between ligand binding and subsequent structural changes. The results can be applied to other homologous proteins (Ikura, 1996), such as calmodulin (Zhang et al., 1995; Kuboniwa et al., 1995; Finn et al., 1995), in which Ca2+ induces conformational changes that modulate their interaction with target proteins. Additionally, insights into the structure of cardiac troponin C can be derived from this skeletal mutant. The Ca2+ binding sites in skeletal TnC involve a pair of HLH in each domain where the Ca2+ ions are coordinated. On the basis of crystal structures of HLH Ca2+ binding proteins (Strynadka & James, 1989), the six amino acid residues involved in Ca2+-coordination were defined; five are in the loop region (X, Y, Z, -Y, -X positions) and the sixth one (-Z) is in the second helix of the HLH motif. In all regular HLH motifs, the residue at -Z is a glutamate and it contributes both of its side-chain oxygens to the calcium coordination (Strynadka & James, 1989). The

FIGURE 1: Representation of the Ca2+-induced opening of the N-domain of troponin C (Gagne et al., 1995). The apo form (Herzberg & ´ ´ James, 1988) and the 2Ca2+ form (Gagne et al., 1995) were superimposed using residues in helices N, A, and D (shown in light gray). The movement of the helix B/helix C unit (shown in medium gray for the apo form and in dark gray for the 2Ca2+ form) upon Ca2+ binding is indicated by the arrows. All figures in this paper were produced with the programs Molscript (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994).

bidentate coordination residue in site I, Glu41, was found to have irregular backbone dihedral angles when NTnC is in the apo form, therefore leading to a "kink" in the B-helix (Herzberg & James, 1988; Satyshur et al., 1988; Gagne et ´ al., 1994, 1995; Strynadka & James, 1989). In the apo form Glu41 forms a salt bridge with Lys40, which could potentially contribute to the stabilization of the kink. It was shown that ´ this kink was straightened upon Ca2+ binding (Gagne et al., 1994, 1995; Slupsky & Sykes, 1995), and it was postulated that this straightening was critical to the function of the N-domain (Gagne et al., 1994). The behavior of the -Z ´ position in site II is different, and there is no kink in the D-helix of 0Ca-NTnC. It has also been shown that sites I and II have different Ca2+ binding affinities (Li et al., 1995) and therefore that Ca2+ binding to NTnC was stepwise. Although it was not possible to unambiguously determine the order of binding, it was suggested that site II has the strongest Ca2+ affinity (Li et al., 1995). Our initial goal was to explore the contribution of site I into the calcium induced structural change by making site I defunct. Removal of the bidentate ligand (Glu41) appeared to be the perfect choice since it meant removing two out of seven coordinating oxygens. In addition to the suppression of Ca2+ binding to site I, the mutation of Glu41 to Ala41 was attractive for the following reasons. First, the mutant will be lacking the salt bridge (Glu41-Lys40) present in the apo form which potentially stabilizes the kink. Second, alanine is an amino acid having helix propensity. The Glu41 to Ala41 mutant might therefore have been expected to favor the straightening of the B-helix and the opening of the structure. A "closed" structure of this mutant in the Ca2+-saturated state would therefore have indicated that binding of Ca2+ to site I was essential to the structural change. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

protein concentration of 1.5-2.0 mM and a Ca2+ concentration of about 5 equiv. Chemical shift assignments (1H, 15N, and 13C) were performed using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments acquired on a Unity 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and Z-pulsed field gradient. The following experiments were used for assignments: HNCACB (Muhandiram & Kay, 1994), CBCA(CO)CANNH (Muhandiram & Kay, 1994), 75 and 150 ms 15N-edited-NOESY (Zhang et al., 1994), 57 ms 15 N-edited-TOCSY (Zhang et al., 1994), 17 ms HCCHTOCSY (Kay et al., 1993), 75 and 150 ms 13C-editedNOESY (Ikura et al., 1990), 2D-COSY in D2O (Rance et al., 1988), and 150 ms 2D-NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979; Macura & Ernst, 1980) in D2O. Valine and leucine methyl groups were stereospecifically assigned using a 13C-HSQC of a 30% 13C-labeled sample (Neri et al., 1989). Coupling constants were obtained using an HNHA experiment (Kuboniwa et al., 1994). Spectra were processed using the software package NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) and analyzed using the program PIPP (Garrett et al., 1991). Interproton distance information was derived from the NOESY experiments listed above. The 2D-NOESY was calibrated on the basis of NOEs corresponding to known distance (Phe H-H ) 2.48 Å). The 75 ms 3D-NOESYs were calibrated using an NOE corresponding to a known distance, located on the same 15N or 13C trace, and an error of 50% was assumed on each NOE intensity. The following distances were used to calibrate the 3D spectra: HNi-HRi ) 2.70-3.05 Å (for residues with negative ), HNi-HRi-1 ) 1.7-3.6 Å, H-C-C-H ) 2.2-3.1 Å, and H-C-CH3 ) 2.5-2.7 Å, H-C-H ) 1.7-1.8 Å. In cases where direct calibration was not possible, the distance constraints were overestimated. For NOEs found only in the 150 ms NOESYs, the upper bound was set to 6 Å. For all protonproton restraints, the lower bound was set to 1.7 Å. The Ca2+-ligand distance restraints were set to 2.4 ( 0.4 Å between the Ca2+ ion and the oxygens involved in coordinating Ca2+ (Strynadka & James, 1989). Dihedral restraints for the  angle were obtained from the HNHA experiment, using a correction factor of 1.055. A 25% error on the peak intensities was assumed, and the minimum  dihedral restraint range was set to (10°. The initial set of restraints included only a portion of the NOEs found in Table 1, no

Accelerated Publications RESULTS The Ca2+ titration of E41A-NTnC revealed an unexpected result; despite removal of the bidentate ligand, site I was still able to bind Ca2+ (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). Using an approach similar to the one used in Li et al. (1995), the two dissociation constants were determined to be 10-20 µM and 1-2 mM for site II and site I, respectively.3 The weak binding was unambiguously assigned to site I, as opposed to nonspecific binding, on the basis of the local chemical shift changes which were observed during the Ca2+ titration. The large chemical shift changes which occur between 1 and 5 equiv of Ca2+ are localized in site I and are consistent with the ones observed in wild-type NTnC (Gagne et al., 1994). The Ca2+ binding constant for ´ site I was reduced by approximately 100-fold relative to wild type (Li et al., 1995), and at the Ca2+ concentration used in this study, site I is 80% filled. This brought a completely new focus to the study: monitoring the critical role of a single residue, Glu41, in the function of skeletal troponin C and elucidating the mechanism of the calcium-induced structural change in these proteins. The 3D structure of 2Ca-E41A-NTnC has been determined using 1439 experimental restraints (Table 1) derived from NMR spectroscopy. Figure 2 shows a stereoview of the bestfit superimposition of the backbone atoms. On the basis of restraint violations, rmsd values, and Ramachandran plots (Table 1), this structure is of high quality. The structure consists of five helices (N, residues 5-13; A, 16-28; B, 42-49; C, 55-64; and D, 75-84) and two calcium-binding loops (I, 30-41, and II, 66-77) connected by a short -sheet (36-38, 72-74). There is no significant difference in the secondary structure of 2Ca-E41A-NTnC compared with wildtype 0Ca-NTnC and 2Ca-NTnC. The five helices are very well defined, having individual backbone rmsd around 0.23 ( 0.07 Å (Table 1). The -sheet and site II are also well defined, having backbone rmsd of 0.25 ( 0.08 and 0.24 ( 0.06 Å, respectively. The good definition found in site II is not due to the Ca2+ restraints used for the final structure calculation. Structural calculations were made without the Ca2+ restraints and yielded a similar definition for site II. Although the Ca2+ restraints provide a better definition for the side chains involved in coordination of the ion, the backbone conformation of site II is a result of the experimental NMR data. Unlike site II, site I is not as well defined (backbone rmsd of 0.60 ( 0.22 Å). The poorer definition of site I relative to site II is partially due to the smaller number of experimental restraints. Other poorly defined regions include the N- and C-terminal residues and the B-C linker. Backbone amide 15N relaxation studies4 have shown that these residues have lower order parameters (S2), indicating that the poor definition is due at least in part to flexibility and not only to a lack of structural restraints. Figure 3 compares the average NMR structure of 2CaE41A-NTnC with the X-ray structure of 0Ca-NTnC (Herzberg & James, 1988) and the recently solved X-ray structure of 2Ca-NTnC.2 The quality of the structure presented here is significantly better than the NMR structure of 2Ca-NTnC (Gagne et al., 1995), due to a larger number of medium´ and long-range NOEs, to the absence of the dimerization

Of the residues having well-defined backbone atoms, 55 residues (82%) had a 1 and/or 2 circular variance (Laskowski et al., 1993) smaller than 0.4 and were selected as having well-defined side-chain heavy atoms. Those 55 residues are 6-14, 18-20, 22-26, 29, 36, 37, 39, 41-47, 49, 56-66, 68-73, 75-77, and 79-84. h Average of the individual helical rms deviations. N(5-13): 0.22 ( 0.07/0.84 ( 0.15 .

From this initial set of restraints and starting from an extended structure, 101 structures were generated with the simulated annealing protocol (sa.inp) implemented in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992), ¨ using 12 000 high-temperature steps (60 ps at 1000 K) and 6000 cooling steps (30 ps, final temperature of 100 K). Out of those 101 structures, 50 folded properly (i.e., had significant lower total energy than the rest) and were kept as starting structures for further rounds of refinements. The refinement rounds were also done with the simulated annealing protocol, but using 6000 high-temperature step (30 ps) and 4000 cooling steps (20 ps). The set of structures presented in this paper includes the 40 structures with the lowest total energy selected from the 50 structures obtained in the last round of refinement.

The backbone (N, CR, C) of the family of 40 structures is shown in "rods" representations, and the site II Ca2+ position in each of these structures is shown by a small sphere. Although Ca2+ is present in solution in site I, there is no Ca2+ shown here because none was used in the calculations, as the coordination state of site I was not known a priori. The five helices are labeled N, A, B, C, and D. The two Ca2+ binding loops are labeled I and II.

problem which was present in 2Ca-NTnC (Gagne et al., ´ 1995), and possibly to improvements in the techniques used. We therefore used the recent crystal structure of 2Ca-NTnC as opposed to the NMR structure we previously published (Gagne et al., 1995), since it is of very high resolution (1.78 ´ Å). Comparison of the helix packing in 2Ca-E41A-NTnC with 0Ca-NTnC and 2Ca-NTnC reveals both similarities and differences. The arrangement of helices N, A, and D is virtually identical in all three structures; the backbone rmsd for these residues (5-28, 75-84) with 0Ca-NTnC and 2CaNTnC is 0.73 and 0.76 Å, respectively. Since these three helices are not significantly affected by the Ca2+ state, this

superimposition will be used frequently and will be referred to NAD. The packing of helix B is similar to 0Ca2+-NTnC (NAD: rmsd of 1.3 Å) and therefore has major differences with 2Ca-NTnC (9.2 Å). Helix C is positioned between 0CaNTnC (NAD: rmsd of 2.5 Å) and 2Ca-NTnC (8.8 Å), closer to 0Ca-NTnC. The state of the helix packing of E41A is clearly represented by the measure of its interhelical angles. When compared with the apo or 2Ca2+ form of TnC and calmodulin, the interhelical angles of 2Ca-E41A-NTnC are like the apo forms, rather than the 2Ca2+ forms (Table 2). We have also looked at the accessible surface area of the nonpolar groups, which is a measure of the exposure of the

Accelerated Publications al., 1995; Slupsky & Sykes, 1995; Zhang et al., 1995; Kuboniwa et al., 1995; Finn et al., 1995), the mechanism by which Ca2+ causes the "opening" in not known. The structure of 2Ca-E41A-NTnC provides a unique tool to understand how proteins like TnC and calmodulin operate, as it is a snapshot of NTnC just prior to the opening. As shown above, binding of Ca2+ to site II does not trigger the opening of the N-domain. Only minor structural changes occur upon Ca2+ binding in E41A-NTnC. Binding of Ca2+ to site II, which has been shown to be important (Sheng et al., 1990; Sorenson et al., 1995), requires rearrangement of the ligands and the loop which can be accommodated without opening the domain. Similarly, binding of Ca2+ to site I (Glu41 not coordinated) does not open the N-domain. This demonstrates that the ligands in site I, with the exception of Glu41, can coordinate Ca2+ with only minor rearrangements, as was originally proposed (Strynadka & James, 1989). Exposure of the hydrophobic patch is an unfavorable event, and therefore the opening will not occur unless it is necessary and energetically favorable. As shown in Figure 5, the two oxygens of Glu41 in 0Ca-NTnC are 10.8 Å away from the Ca2+ position. These oxygens must approach the Ca2+ ion to 2.4 Å (Strynadka & James, 1989) in order for site I to bind Ca2+ properly. Unlike the other ligands in site I and II, Glu41 cannot coordinate the Ca2+ ion when the domain is in the closed form. To reach the Ca2+, Glu41 causes changes in the backbone dihedral angle at the base of helix B, which result in a reorientation of the helix B/helix C unit. We therefore conclude that it is the coordination of Glu41 to the Ca2+ ion that ultimately leads to the opening of the domain and that the other ligands play a role in positioning the Ca2+ and setting the stage for Glu41. Glu41 literally "locks" the domain in the open form. The two hinges in this structural reorientation occur at the beginning of helix B (primarily at residue Glu41) and at the end of helix C (primarily at residue Val65) (indicated by arrows in Figure 3B). The identification of Val65 as the hinge at the C-terminal end of the helix B/helix C unit is based on the observation that the backbone change that occurs at Val65 when NTnC binds two Ca2+ is not found in 2Ca-E41A-NTnC (Table 3). The backbone dihedral angles of Val65 in 2CaE41A-NTnC are identical, within experimental errors, to the one of 0Ca-NTnC (Table 3). The best experimental measure of the  dihedral angle in solution is the backbone coupling constant, 3JHN-HR. The coupling constant measured for Val65 in 2Ca-E41A-NTnC (7.5 Hz) is similar to the one observed in the NMR data of 0Ca-NTnC (7.4Hz; Gagne et al., 1994) ´ and to the one expected from the crytal structure of 0CaNTnC (-84° w 7.3 Hz) but significantly different from the one expected for the crystal structure of 2Ca-NTnC (-115° w 9.8 Hz) (the 3JHN-HR was not obtained in the NMR data of 2Ca-NTnC; Gagne et al., 1994). It is interesting to note ´ that the dihedral changes that occur at the two hinges are similar, but opposite in direction (Table 3). To investigate the mechanism further, we have done the following experiment. We looked at an E77A mutant of NTnC,5 Glu77 being the site II homologue of Glu41. Preliminary results showed that this mutant was unable to bind any Ca2+ strongly. Similar Ca2+ binding properties were observed for comparable mutants (Glu f Gln) of calmodulin (Maune et al., 1992). This inability of site I to bind Ca2+

These values show that the hydrophobic patch is not exposed in 2Ca-E41A-NTnC. As expected, site II adopts a conformation very close to the 2Ca-NTnC one (NAD: rmsd of 0.99 Å). When site II is superimposed (residues 66-77), the Ca2+ position in 2CaE41A-NTnC is only 0.26 Å away from the one in 2CaNTnC. Similarly, site I has a conformation similar to the 2Ca-NTnC one as far as residues 30-38 are concerned (Figure 4). As was pointed out previously (Service, 1995), it is important that the mutation does not change the way Ca2+ sits in the binding pocket. DISCUSSION Muscle contraction is triggered by the Ca2+-induced conformational change that occurs in the regulatory domain of TnC. Upon binding of two Ca2+ ions, the N-domain of TnC "opens" and exposes a large hydrophobic patch (Gagne ´ et al., 1995; Slupsky & Sykes, 1995; Herzberg et al., 1986). A similar structural change occurs in calmodulin upon Ca2+ binding (Zhang et al., 1995; Kuboniwa et al., 1995; Finn et al., 1995). Although the Ca2+-induced structural change found in these proteins is now well determined (Gagne et ´

The backbone of loop I and helix B are shown in light gray, the side chain of Glu41 is shown in the dark gray stick representation, the position of the Ca2+ ion is shown by the large sphere, and the coordination oxygens of Glu41 are shown by small spheres. The indicated distance is between the Ca2+ ion and the centre of the two coordinating oxygens. (A) Glu41 in closed form (0Ca-NTnC) (Herzberg & James, 1988). The kink at residue Glu41 is clearly visible. (B) Same as in (A) but with the side-chain 1 and 2 angles of Glu41 modified in order to minimize the distance of the ligands to the Ca2+ ion. The coordinating oxygens are still 6.2 Å away the Ca2+ ion, 3.8 Å short of the coordinating distance (2.4 Å; Strynadka & James, 1989). (C) Glu41 in 2Ca-NTnC.2

strongly when site II is perturbed shows that although complete Ca2+ binding to site I causes the opening, calcium binding to site II is first required. We previously determined the two different Ca2+ binding constants of the N-domain (Li et al., 1995), but we were unable to unambiguously associate them to their corresponding sites. The results presented here clearly indicate that the strongest Ca2+ binding occurs in site II. The Ca2+ binding scenario for NTnC is therefore the following: the first Ca2+ binds to site II, causing only minor conformational changes but setting the stage; then the second Ca2+ binds to site I, causing the structural change required to trigger skeletal muscle contraction. As mentioned earlier, the structure of this skeletal mutant can potentially be used as a model for cardiac TnC which is unable to bind Ca2+ in site I. Cardiac TnC is 70% homologous to skeletal TnC, and the majority of the differences occur in the first 40 residues. The results presented here strongly suggest that the Ca2+-induced structural change in cardiac TnC does not involve an extensive opening of the structure as was found for skeletal TnC, as there is no calcium in site I. Since cardiac and skeletal TnC are nearly identical in the second HLH (site II), it is very likely that the Ca2+-saturated structure of cardiac NTnC resemble 2Ca-E41A-NTnC more than 2Ca-NTnC. This has recently been verified with the determination of the Ca2+-bound cardiac TnC structure.6 The mechanism of the direct coupling between calcium binding and induced structural change can be summarized as follows. First, the opening of the structure exposes a large hydrophobic patch, an event which is energetically unfavor6 S. K. Sia, M. X. Li, L. Spyracopoulos, S. M. Gagne, W. Liu, J. A. ´ Putkey, and B. D. Sykes, unpublished data.

able in water (G  2.0 kcal mol-1; Foguel et al., 1996). This exposure can only occur if the favorable interactions associated with Ca2+ binding compensate for it and if the binding of Ca2+ cannot be accommodated in the closed form. Second, the structural change is defined as a hinge motion between two units, one including the N, A, and D helices and the other the B and C helices. Finally, the movement of the BC unit relative to the NAD unit, which involves the diplacement of several residues by more than 15 Å, is driven by a single amino acid, Glu41. Clearly, several factors contribute to the regulation of muscle contraction. However, we have shown that the "muscular work" (i.e., opening of the regulatory domain of skeletal TnC to trigger contraction) was accomplished by Glu41 reaching for the Ca2+ ion, and one could look at it as "flexing muscle with one amino acid" (Service, 1995).
