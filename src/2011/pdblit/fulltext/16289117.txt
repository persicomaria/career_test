Abstract TAK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) is activated by its specific activator, TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1). A constitutively active TAK1 mutant has not yet been generated due to the indispensable requirement of TAB1 for TAK1 kinase activity. In this study, we generated a novel constitutively active TAK1 by fusing its kinase domain to the minimal TAK1activation domain of TAB1. Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that these domains interacted intra-molecularly. The TAK1­TAB1 fusion protein showed a significant MAP3K activity in vitro and activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38 MAPKs and IjB kinase in vivo, which was followed by increased production of interleukin-6. These results indicate that the fusion protein is useful for characterizing the physiological roles of the TAK1­TAB1 complex. Ó 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

TAK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) has been shown to play critical roles in signaling pathways stimulated by transforming growth factor-b, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), lipopolysaccharide, receptor activator of NFjB ligand, and IL-18 [1­7]. TAK1 regulates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 MAPKs and IjB kinase (IKK) signaling pathways, leading to the activation of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-jB [1­11]. The innate immunity against Gram-negative bacteria is dependent on the TAK1-induced NF-jB activation in Drosophila [12]. In addition, TAK1 is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, in which TAK1 downregulates transcription mediated by a complex of b-catenin and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor [13,14]. Two functionally important TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2, are identified to date [15,16]. TAB1 is a specific activator of TAK1 and associates with the Nterminal kinase domain of TAK1. The TAK1-activation domain consisting of C-terminal 68 amino acids of

TAB1 is sufficient for the association with and the activation of TAK1 [15,17]. Autophosphorylations of threonine/serine residues in the activation loop are necessary for TAB1-induced TAK1 activation [17,18]. TAB2 is an adaptor protein linking TNF-a receptor associating protein 6 (TRAF6) and TAK1­TAB1 complex in the IL-1 signaling pathway [19,20]. IL-1 stimulates translocation of TAB2 from the membrane to the cytosol. Recently, Wang et al. [21] reported that an ubiquitination-dependent process is also involved in molecular mechanism of the TAK1 activation. Kinase-inactive (dominant negative) and constitutively active (dominant active) mutants have been used for characterizing a physiological role of protein kinase [1]. Kinase activity dead mutant can be generated by introducing point mutation into the conserved lysine residue in the ATP-binding site. TAK1-K63W, a kinaseinactive TAK1, has been used for characterizing the physiological role of TAK1. The molecular mechanism of TAK1 activation has been studied extensively as described above, however, constitutively active TAK1 mutant has yet to be generated mainly due to the requirement of TAB1 for TAK1 kinase activity.

study, we try to generate a novel constitutively active TAK1 by fusing TAK1 to TAB1. Materials and methods
Generation of cDNA encoding TAK1­TAB1 fusion protein. Human cDNA encoding the TAK1 kinase domain (amino acids 1­303) was obtained by PCR with following primers; 50 -ATTAGGATCCATGTC TACAGCCTCTGCCGC-30 and 50 -GCCGGAATTCCTGACAAGG ATACTGTAATG-30 . Human TAB1 cDNA encoding TAK1-activation domain (amino acids 437­504) was obtained by PCR with following primers; 50 -ATgaattcggaggaggaggaggaCAAAGCCCGACCTTAACC CTGC-30 and 50 -ATTAGTCGACCTACGGTGCTGTCACCACGC-30 . The linker sequence between TAK1 and TAB1 is shown in small letters and encodes Glu­Phe­ðGlyÞ5 polypeptides. The restriction sites are underlined. Both the cDNA fragments were inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1-His or pcDNA3.1-HA vectors (Invitrogen). Point mutation of lysine-63 in the ATP-binding site of TAK1 was introduced using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. The expression vectors for FlagTAK1, HA-TAB1, and EGFP-TAB were previously described [3,17]. Cell cultures and transfection. HeLa cells were maintained in DulbeccoÕs modified EagleÕs medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 . Cells were transfected with expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen). In vitro immunocomplex kinase assay. TAK1­TAB1 complex and TAK1­TAB1 fusion protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (M5, Sigma) or anti-HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for TAK1 kinase activity using 6 Â His-MKK6 as a substrate. Co-immunoprecipitation assay. Association between TAK1 and TAB1 was analyzed by Western blotting of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates with an anti-HA antibody. Western blotting was performed as described previously [3]. JNK, p38, and IKK assays. Endogenous JNK and IKK were immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 (FL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-IKKa (H-744, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The protein kinase activities of the immunoprecipitates were determined by in vitro immunocomplex kinase assays using GST-c-Jun (1­54) and GSTIjBa (1­54), respectively [3]. Activation of p38 was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Cell Signaling). ELISA for IL-6 and IL-8. HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for TAK1 and TAB1. After 24 h incubation, release of IL-6 into culture media was evaluated by ELISA kits (GenzymeTECHNE).

To generate a constitutively active mutant, we first tried to introduce point mutations in the activation loop of TAK1. We previously demonstrated that autophosphorylation of one or both of Thr-184 and Thr-187 was necessary for TAB1-induced TAK1 activation [17]. TAK1-TTEE, a mutant substituted the two Thr residues with Glu, showed an impaired kinase activity. Autophosphorylation of TAK1, which was detected as a reduced migration on SDS­PAGE, was also impaired. To further explore which Thr residue is the site of phosphorylation, we generated TAK1 mutants with single mutation (T184E and T187E). When co-expressed with TAB1, TAK1 kinase activity and autophosphorylation of TAK1-T187E, but not TAK1-T184E, were impaired. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that all the TAK1 mutants equally interacted with TAB1, which ruled out the possibility that the impaired activation resulted from a defective association with TAB1. These results indicate that autophosphorylation of Thr-187 is critical for the TAB1-induced TAK1 activation. Kishimoto et al. [18] recently demonstrated that Ser-192 is another site of phosphorylation upon stimulation with IL-1. However, both S192E and S192D mutations did not result in the constitutive activation of TAK1. Together with these observations, a TAB1-independent constitutively active TAK1 mutant could not be generated by the point mutation of Thr/Ser residues to amino acids (see Fig. 1).

Results Point mutation of TAK1 Mammalian TAK1 was first identified as a gene that rescued the ste11D mutation in yeast [1]. The cloned TAK1 was a truncated form (TAK1-DN) that lacks Nterminal 22 amino acids. Full-length TAK1, by contrast, could not rescue the mutation, indicating that TAK1DN acted as a constitutively active mutant in the yeast. On the contrary, we previously reported that TAK1-DN alone had no kinase activity and TAB1 was necessary for its kinase activity in mammalian cells [17]. Therefore, a constitutively active TAK1 mutant that is effective in mammalian systems has yet to be generated.

HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for wild type (WT) or point mutated (TTEE, T184E, and T187E) Flag-TAK1 and HATAB1. The total amount of DNA was adjusted with an empty vector to 2 lg. TAK1 kinase activity was determined by an anti-Flag immunocomplex kinase assay using 6 Â His-MKK6 as a substrate (upper panel). Association between TAK1 and TAB1 was assessed by a coimmunoprecipitation assay using anti-Flag and anti-HA antibodies (middle panel). Protein expression levels of TAK1 and TAB1 were determined by Western blotting of whole cell lysates (lower panel).

Generation of TAK1­TAB1 fusion protein Four splicing variants of human TAK1 (TAK1a, TAK1b, TAK1c, and TAK1d) have been identified [11,22]. They are derived from deletion of exons 12 and/ or 16 in the human TAK1 gene (MAP3K7), which encode the C-terminal regulatory domain such as TAB2binding region [22]. However, the N-terminal kinase domain is conserved among all the TAK1 variants. TAK1a (579 amino acids) is most abundantly expressed in human tissues and is used as TAK1 in this study (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, C-terminal 68 amino acids of TAB1 are sufficient for association with and activation of TAK1 (Fig. 2A). To generate a constitutively active TAK1 as a single polypeptide, we tried to fuse the minimal functional domains of TAK1 and TAB1. The TAK1 kinase domain (amino acids 1­303, TAK1kd) was fused to the TAK1-activation domain of TAB1 (amino acids 437­504, TAB1ad) through a peptide linker Glu­Phe­ðGlyÞ5 to facilitate the association between TAK1kd and TAB1ad (Fig. 2A).

HA-tagged TAK1kd and a fusion protein (TAK1kd­ TAB1ad) were expressed with or without EGFP-fused TAB1ad in HeLa cells. The HA-immunoprecipitates were examined for MAP3K activity in vitro using MKK6 as a substrate (Fig. 2B). TAK1kd alone did not show any kinase activity, while co-expression with EGFP­TAB1ad significantly induced TAK1 kinase activity. This result ruled out a possibility that deletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain of TAK1 resulted in TAB1-independent constitutive activation. In contrast, TAK1kd­TAB1ad fusion protein showed kinase activity, which is independent of co-expression with EGFP­ TAB1ad (Fig. 2B). A kinase-inactive mutant (KW) showed no kinase activity, indicating that the protein kinase activity of TAK1kd­TAB1ad was derived from the TAK1 kinase domain. These results demonstrated that TAK1kd­TAB1ad is a novel polypeptide with a significant MAP3K activity of TAK1. Intra-molecular interaction of TAK1kd and TAB1ad Association between wild type TAK1 and TAB1 is mediated through TAK1kd and TAB1ad. We next investigated whether these domains in the fusion protein are associated intra-molecularly or inter-molecularly (Fig. 3). To address this issue, HA-tagged and Xpress (XP)-tagged fusion proteins were co-expressed in HeLa cells and co-immunoprecipitation assay was examined. If association is mediated through inter-molecularly, XP-TAK1kd­TAB1ad will be co-immunoprecipitated with HA-TAK1kd­TAB1ad. But, the co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins could not be detected,

activated these signaling pathways, comparable to the activation by wild type TAK1 and TAB1 (Fig. 4). Activation of JNK, p38, and IKK leads to the transcriptional activation of AP-1 and NF-jB, and IL-6 is a cytokine that is upregulated by these transcription factors. Therefore, we examined the effect of fusion protein on IL-6 production in HeLa cells. The production of IL6 was induced by TAK1kd­TAB1ad (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with the previous observation that overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1 induced the IL-6 promoter activity in myocardial cells [23]. These results indicate that the fusion protein acted as a constitutively active TAK1 in mammalian cells in vivo.

Discussion TAK1 is a MAP3K activated by autophosphorylation and ubiquitination, in which TAB1 plays an indispensable role [17,18,21]. In this study, we succeeded in generating a novel constitutively active TAK1 polypeptide by fusing the minimal TAK1-activation domain of TAB1. The fusion protein stimulated the TAK1­ TAB1 complex-induced signaling pathways in mammalian cells, suggesting that it is available for use in experiments on the physiological roles of the TAK1­ TAB1 complex. TAB1 associates with N-terminal catalytic domain of TAK1. In contrast, another TAK1-binding protein TAB2 associates with C-terminal regulatory domain of TAK1 [16]. TAB2 translocates from membrane to cytosol and acts as an adaptor protein linking TRAF6 and TAK1­TAB1 complex in the IL-1 signaling pathway. The constitutively active TAK1­TAB1 fusion protein lacks the binding domain of TAB2, indicating that the activation of TAK1­TAB1 fusion protein is independent of TAB2. Perhaps the most interesting approach is the establishment of transgenic mice expressing the fusion construct in a tissue-specific manner. The gene encoding the fusion protein is a powerful tool for the generation of transgenic mice, because a single transgene makes it possible to examine effects of activation of the TAK1­ TAB1 complex. Previously, Zhang et al. [24] established transgenic mice expressing TAK1-DN in the heart. However, we reported that TAK1-DN did not show any kinase activity and its activation is dependent on coexpression with TAB1 [17]. Therefore, the cardiac hypertrophic phenotype of the transgenic mice may not be derived from TAK1 kinase activity. The activation of endogenous TAK1­TAB1 complex mediated by depletion of an unknown negative regulatory protein is a possible mechanism for triggering the hypertrophy in the myocardium of transgenic mice. In contrast, we showed that the fusion protein effectively activated TAK1-induced signaling pathways such as JNK, p38,

Activation of endogenous JNK and IKK was determined by in vitro immunocomplex kinase assays using GST-c-Jun (1­79) and GST-IjBa (1­54) as substrates, respectively. Activation of p38 was determined by Western blotting with an anti-phospho-38 antibody. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blotting of whole cell lysates. The lower band for IKKa in the second lane was derived from the cross-reactivity of IKKa antibody to full-length TAK1.

suggesting that TAK1kd associated intra-molecularly with TAB1ad in the fusion protein. Activation of downstream signaling pathways TAK1 has been shown to stimulate JNK, p38, and IKK signaling pathways. We investigated the potential of TAK1kd­TAB1ad to activate the downstream signaling pathways. Overexpression of the fusion protein

and IKK. Characterization of transgenic mice expressing the fusion protein in the heart will clearly confirm the contribution of the TAK1­TAB1 complex toward the hypertrophic phenotype. Ono et al. [25] recently reported an a-helical solution structure for a synthetic polypeptide of TAK1-activation domain of TAB1. The TAK1­TAB1 fusion protein is also available for the X-ray crystal structure analysis. It consists of minimal essential domains for TAK1 activation. In addition, the intra-molecular interaction of TAK1kd with TAB1ad and the low molecular weight of the construct compared with the full-length TAK1­ TAB1 complex are beneficial for the analysis. The crystal structure analysis of fusion protein will provide information on molecular mechanism for the TAB1-induced TAK1 activation and the development of selective TAK1 inhibitors. Taken together, the novel constitutively active mutant will contribute to future characterization of the physiological and pathophysiological functions of TAK1 in mammalian systems.
