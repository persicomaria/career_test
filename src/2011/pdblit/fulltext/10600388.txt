Abstract The cystine knot structural motif is present in peptides and proteins from a variety of species, including fungi, plants, marine molluscs, insects and spiders. It comprises an embedded ring formed by two disul®de bonds and their connecting backbone segments which is threaded by a third disul®de bond. It is invariably associated with nearby bsheet structure and appears to be a highly ecient motif for structure stabilization. Because of this stability it makes an ideal framework for molecular engineering applications. In this review we summarize the main structural features of the cystine knot motif, focussing on toxin molecules containing either the inhibitor cystine knot or the cyclic cystine knot. Peptides containing these motifs are 26±48 residues long and include ion channel blockers, haemolytic agents, as well as molecules having antiviral and antibacterial activities. The stability of peptide toxins containing the cystine knot motif, their range of bioactivities and their unique structural scaold can be harnessed for molecular engineering applications and in drug design. Applications of cystine knot molecules for the treatment of pain, and their potential use in antiviral and antibacterial applications are described. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The cystine knot is a fascinating structural motif in which an embedded ring formed by two disul®de bonds and their connecting backbone segments is threaded by a third disul®de bond, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The motif has been formally identi®ed for less than a decade but is now known to occur in a wide

variety of peptides and proteins and is relatively common in small cysteine-rich toxins. The cystine knot appears to engender a particularly high degree of stability to molecules that contain it and thus oers potential as a valuable framework in protein engineering applications. In this article we describe the structural features and biological activities of toxin molecules containing this motif, along with chemical methods for their synthesis. The ability to synthesize and determine structures of peptides containing the cystine knot enables a range of potential protein engineering and drug design applications. Examples of these are described.

Fig. 1. The cystine knot motif in which an embedded ring formed by two disul®de bonds and their connecting backbone segments (indicated by variable amino acids X) is penetrated by a third disul®de bond. The indicated spacings for the embedded ring are based on currently known cystine knot molecules.

2. Discovery of the cystine knot The term ``cystine knot' was ®rst introduced in 1993 (McDonald and Hendrickson 1993; Murray-Rust et al., 1993) in reviews describing recently determined structures for several growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF), transforming growth factor b2 (TGFb2), and platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB). It was noted that these proteins contained an unusual motif comprising an embedded disul®de ring and a penetrating disul®de bond. The apparently knotted arrangement of disul®de bonds was associated with several b-strands in these structures. While the ®rst published examples of cystine knots were associated with growth factors it soon became clear that the motif is also relatively common in a range of smaller peptides. In the early 1990's others and we had determined the structures of several small disul®de rich proteins, including trypsin inhibitors, cone snail toxins, and a novel uterotonic agent from plants called kalata B1 (See Table 1). It turned out that the structures of these small molecules contained a knot motif very similar to that present in the growth factors. All of these molecules shared the disul®de connectivity Cys(I±IV), Cys(II±V) and Cys(III±VI), but when protein topologies were taken into account the motifs were not directly superimposable with those of the growth factors. This led to the proposal in 1994 that the family of small disul®de rich molecules, all of which adopted some inhibitory role, be referred to as inhibitor cystine knots (Pallaghy et al., 1994) to distinguish them from the growth factor knots. This included a family of small disul®de rich proteins that

had earlier been referred to as knottins (Le Nguyen et al., 1990). A review in 1995 (Isaacs, 1995) formalized the separation of cystine knots into inhibitory or growth factor families. Several other reviews relating to cystine knots have since been published (Narasimhan et al., 1994; Harrison and Sternberg, 1996; Norton and Pallaghy, 1998; Tamaoki et al., 1998). The main feature which has been used in the past to distinguish the two types of cystine knots, apart from the dierent protein families from which they are derived, is that in the growth factor family the Cys(I±IV) disul®de bond penetrates the embedded ring formed by the other two disul®de bonds, while in the inhibitor family Cys(III±VI) is the penetrating disul®de bond. (It is conventional to label the six Cys residues involved in the knot as I±VI, in order from the N- to C-terminus, ignoring other intervening Cys residues, if any, not involved in the knot, a convention that is used throughout this review). Fig. 2 shows the dierent handedness of the two types of knots and schematically illustrates the close association of the knot motif with b-sheet structure. Generally the sizes of the growth factor proteins are signi®cantly larger than those of the inhibitory peptides, but in the topological representations shown the number of residues is not important. Even so, the loop sizes within the knot regions of the two classes are remarkably similar, perhaps indicating a special signi®cance of ring size on the stability of the knot. Fig. 2 also shows the topology of one of the earliest examples of a cystine knot molecule that has a rather unique feature. In addition to an embedded disul®de ring, kalata B1 (Saether et al., 1995) has a circular protein backbone, leading us (Craik et al., 1999) to classify this as the prototypic representative of the cyclic cystine knot (CCK) family. Nearly 40 peptides have now been reported which make up this family of plant peptides, which we refer to as the cyclotides (Craik et al., 1999). Thus, we currently recognize three families of cystine knot molecules: . Growth factor cystine knots (GFCKs), exempli®ed by NGF, TGFb2 and PDGF-BB . Inhibitor cystine knots (ICKs), present in a variety of plant and animal toxins . Cyclic cystine knots (CCKs), present in the plant cyclotides In the remainder of this review we focus on cystine knots which occur in toxin molecules and will not further discuss growth factor knots. Since kalata B1 and other members of the CCK family exhibit toxic properties, including haemolytic, antibacterial and antiviral activities, both the ICK and CCK families are included in the following discussion.

a Alignment of the cystine knot containing peptides is primarily based on the cysteine residues and on the conserved residues involved in the three b-strands. The cysteines are highlighted in bold and numbered I±VI and the backbone loops are numbered 1±6 with the spacings within the loops indicated. The ring composition (m/n ) refers to the number of residues in each of the backbone strand, CIXmCI1 (loop 1) and CIVXnCV (loop 4), of the ring. The ring size is the total number of residues within the cystine knot ring m  n  4). The sequences are ordered based on ring size. References are as follows: kalata B1 (Saether et al., 1995), circulin A (Daly et al., 1999a), cycloviolacin O1 (Craik et al., 1999), AVR9 (Vervoot et al., 1997), CPI (Rees and Lipscomb, 1982), EETI II (Chiche et al., 1989), CMTI I (Nilges et al., 1991), GVIA (Pallaghy and Norton, 1999), SHL1 (Lu et al., 1999b), POI (Daquinag et al., 1999), MVIIA (Nielsen et al., 1996), MVIIC (Farr-Jones et al., 1995), PVIIA (Scanlon et al., 1997), o-Atracotoxin-HV1 (Fletcher et al., 1997b), gurmarin (Fletcher et al., 1999), a-amylase inhibitor (Lu et al., 1999a), contoxin GS (Hill et al., 1997), huwentoxin-1 (Qu et al., 1997), robustoxin (Pallaghy et al., 1997), d-atracotoxin-HV1 (Fletcher et al., 1997a), m-agatoxin 1 (Omecinsky et al., 1996), m-agatoxin IV (Omecinsky et al., 1996), o-agatoxin IVA (Kim et al., 1995) and o-agatoxin IVB (Reily et al., 1995).

3. Toxin molecules containing the cystine knot Table 1 lists a representative collection of toxin molecules that incorporate a cystine knot within their structures. These include peptides from plants, animals and fungi. The sequences are aligned based on the six conserved Cys residues that make up the knot (labeled I to VI using the same convention as in Fig. 2) and are ordered based on the size of the embedded ring within the knots. The loops referred to in the table header are the backbone segments between successive Cys residues. Note that some peptides contain extra Cys residues which form other disul®de bonds not involved in the cystine knot but these are not considered in de®ning loop spacing. With this ordering based on ring size it is rather striking that those peptides with smallest rings come mainly from plants and fungi, while those from animals tend to have larger embedded rings. The tightness of this ring should not be underestimated. Fig. 3 shows a space-®lling model of the embedded ring from kalata B1. It is likely that the tight packing of Cys residues within this core contributes signi®cantly to the stability of the knot. Table 1 summarizes the breakdown of ring sizes into CIXmCI1 (loop 1) and CIVXnCV (loop 4) subcomponents on the two sides of the ring. With one exception the embedded ring is asymmetric Ð i.e., the number of backbone connecting residues between successive Cys residues on one side of the ring is always dierent from that on the other side, as implied by Fig. 1. The side of the ring closest to the N-terminus of the protein generally contains a larger number of residues m  3±7 than the other side n  1±4). Note that these two sides of the ring occur in parallel (but non-adjacent) b-strands which are connected by a pair of disul®de bonds.

Table 2 summarizes the sources, sizes and some properties of known cystine knot peptides. Almost all have a net positive charge, with the animal-derived peptides generally being more highly charged than those originating from plants. The peptides range in size from 26 to 48 residues. Toxins containing the cystine knot motif exhibit a range of biological activities from antimicrobial to anti-HIV to ion-channel blockade. This wide range of activities opens the possibility that some of these molecules may be useful leads in drug design applications. 4. Structures of cystine knot toxins Because small disul®de rich peptides are dicult to crystallize, most of the information on structures of toxins containing the cystine knot has come from solution NMR studies. Fig. 4 shows the structures of two well-characterized examples, MVIIA and kalata B1, as representatives of the ICK and CCK families respectively. The ®gure shows that the predominant secondary structure element in either case is a distorted triple stranded b-sheet that is intimately associated with the cystine knot. The association with b-sheet structure is so strong that in descriptions of the cystine knot the bsheet is often regarded as integral to the cystine knot motif (Norton and Pallaghy, 1998). One of the features to emerge from our analysis of the three-dimensional structures of cystine knot toxins is that the characteristic I±IV, II±V, III±VI connectivity of Cys residues is a necessary, but not sucient condition for formation of the knot. For example, the conotoxin GIIIB, which has identical disul®de connectivity to the cystine knot peptide conotoxin GS (Table 1), and like GS, is a sodium channel blocker, does not contain a cystine knot motif, as illustrated in

Fig. 2. Schematic diagrams of the three classes of cystine knots. The b-strands are drawn as arrows, the cysteine residues are labelled I±VI in order from the N- to C-terminus and the disul®de bonds are represented as shaded lines. The penetrating disul®de bond for the growth factor cystine knot is Cys(I±IV) whereas it is Cys(III±VI) in the inhibitor cystine knot and cyclic cystine knot peptides (see text).

Fig. 5. This shows that cystine connectivities alone, or even in conjunction with similarity of biological action do not necessarily allow deductions about knotted structures to be made in all cases. However, the spacings between Cys residues in GIIIB (Fig. 5) are dierent from the consensus spacings seen in knotted peptides, thus providing a guide to discriminate knotted from non-knotted species. Amongst the ®rst group of peptides exhibiting the ICK motif the consensus sequence CX3±7CX4±6CX0± 5CX1±4CX4±10C was identi®ed (Pallaghy et al., 1994). With new members emerging over recent years this was updated to CX3±7CX3±6CX0±5CX1±4CX4±13C in 1998 (Norton and Pallaghy, 1998), and can now be further expanded to CX3±7CX3±8CX0±7CX1±4CX4±13C based on the latest sequences given in Table 1. Determination of the three-dimensional structures of cystine knot-containing molecules has allowed additional features associated with the motif, including characteristic b-sheet and hydrogen bonding patterns to be identi®ed. These consensus features of the cystine knot are summarized in Fig. 6. The b-strands shown have been reported (Pallaghy et al., 1994) as the minimal conserved elements amongst ICK peptides whose structures have been determined, although in several cases the b-strands may be longer. The length of the third b-strand, XXCX, is a little ambiguous, and is shorter in some molecules such as MVIIA, in which the ®nal X residue is not present in the sequence (Table 1) and hence cannot be a part of a strand. Similarly, in many of the cyclotides (Craik et al., 1999) this strand is a part of a b-hairpin in which the minimal consensus element is XCX±xx±XCX, where the ±xx± are the central two

residues of the hairpin turn. Nevertheless, the representation in Fig. 6 is a convenient descriptor of our current understanding of the cystine knot motif. It will undoubtedly be revised and extended as new structures are determined. 5. The cyclic cystine knot We noted above that cystine knot peptides include some unusual molecules that contain a circular peptide backbone. In particular, it has now been shown that kalata B1 is just one member of a new family of macrocyclic peptides we have termed the cyclotides (Craik et al., 1999). These peptides are approximately 30 amino acids in length and are isolated from plants in the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families. They display an interesting range of biological activities which led to their initial discovery: the circulins were found in a screen for anti-HIV activity (Gustafson et al., 1994), cyclopsychotride A inhibits neurotensin binding (Witherup et al., 1994) and kalata B1 has uterotonic activity (Gran, 1973; Saether et al., 1995). Violapeptide I (Schopke et al., 1993) was originally discovered based È on its haemolytic activity and it has recently been shown that kalata B1 (Daly et al., 1999b; Tam et al., 1999), the circulins (Daly et al., 1999b; Tam et al., 1999), and cyclopsychotride A (Tam et al., 1999) also have haemolytic activity. A large number of additional peptides from this family have been discovered in the last year. These include the varv peptides A±H from Viola arvensis (Claeson et al., 1998; Goransson et al., È 1999) several peptides from Viola odorata, Viola hederaceae and Oldenlandia anis (Craik et al., 1999),

several new circulins (Gustafson et al., 2000) and the cycloviolins (Hallock et al., 2000). There is approximately 40% sequence conservation throughout the known cyclotide sequences, which are summarized in Table 3. While many of the examples shown in Table 3 are quite similar in sequence, it is interesting that the

total number of CCK peptides now exceeds the number of ICK peptides. We have determined the three-dimensional structures of three members of this family (kalata B1 (Saether et al., 1995), circulin A (Daly et al., 1999a) and cycloviolacin O1 (Craik et al., 1999)) by NMR spectroscopy

and have con®rmed the presence of a cystine knot motif (Craik et al., 1999), again associated with a local b-sheet structure. Fig. 7 summarizes the structural features (cystine knot, turns and sheet) common to the cyclotides and highlights regions of conserved sequence. While full three-dimensional structures have not been determined for most of the structures in Table 3, the strongly conserved pattern and spacing of Cys residues suggests that all will have the consensus structure shown in Fig. 7. The conservation of loop spacings in the CCK peptides, CX3CX4CX4±7CX1CX4± 5CX5±7, is even tighter than is seen in the ICK peptides. The embedded ring associated with loops 1 and 4, CIX3CII/CIVX1CV, is absolutely conserved. Interestingly, the cysteine spacing for these loops is identical to that noted by Tamaoki et al. (1998) for the cystinestabilized b-helix (CSH) present in many toxins. An intriguing observation that has emerged from structural studies on the plant cyclotides relates to a cis peptide bond in the backbone of some family members. The sequences in Table 3 fall into two subfamilies, which have been termed the bracelet cyclotides and the Moebius cyclotides (Craik et al., 1999). This derives from the fact that if the protein backbone is regarded as a ribbon, then forming a circular ribbon without a twist leads to a bracelet, whereas a single twist results in a Moebius strip. Since the Trp±Pro bond in loop 5 of kalata B1 is cis and all other peptide bonds are trans, kalata B1 may thus be regarded as a

molecular Moebius strip. It is assumed that other peptides with the Trp±Pro element (lower half of Table 3) will also adopt this cis bond, although this is yet to be con®rmed. The peptides in the upper half of Table 3 do not have the Trp±Pro element, and in the published structures from this sub-family, all peptide bonds were trans, leading to the ``bracelet'' descriptor for these cyclotides. 6. Topological considerations Ð unknotting of the cystine knot There is a fundamental topological dierence between the cyclic and acyclic cystine knot proteins. Although commonly referred to as knots, the latter are in fact not knotted in a mathematical sense (Mans®eld, 1994; Mislow and Liang, 1996) and are topologically simple (Mao, 1993). This means that the conventional disul®de connectivity shown in Fig. 8A may be drawn in two dimensions on a non-crossing diagram, such as in Fig. 8B. By contrast, the CCK peptides are topologically complex, and cannot be represented without crossing in a planar diagram (Fig. 8C). It is interesting to note that backbone cyclisation is a necessary, but not sucient, condition for knotting as described here, because it is possible to envisage cyclic disul®de-rich proteins such as that represented in Fig. 8D, which are not knotted. A circular peptide with this topology was

Fig. 6. Consensus features of the ICK motif. The b-strands are shown as arrows with the consensus residues shown as C and X, for cysteine and residues which are not necessarily cysteines respectively. The cysteine residues are labelled I±VI and the loops are labelled 1±5 with the number of intra-cysteine residues shown in boxes on each loop. Hydrogen bonds which are generally present in the cystine knot motif are drawn with arrows from the amide proton to the carbonyl (Pallaghy et al., 1994). CCK peptides ®t this consensus motif but the loop spacings are more tightly conserved and the N- and C-termini are joined. This leads to an additional loop (loop 6) which has the spacing n  5±7X

a The cyclic cystine knot peptides appear to fall into two subfamilies; the bracelet and Moebius cyclotides. The conserved cysteine residues are boxed and the other conserved residues are highlighted in bold. As for Table 1, the cysteines are numbered I±VI at the top of the table and the loops numbered 1±6 at the bottom of the table. The disul®de connectivities are also shown at the bottom of the table. Cycloviolacin O8 was previously reported (Craik et al., 1999), not to contain a Gly at position 2, however, we have since con®rmed that it is present. The X in violapeptide I was not determined in the original report but is presumably R based on sequence homology.

recently isolated from Rhesus monkey leukocytes (Tang et al., 1999). We recently noted (Craik et al., 1999) that the issue of whether there are knots in proteins is controversial (Mao, 1993; Mans®eld, 1994; Mislow and Liang, 1996; Takusagawa and Kamitori, 1996), and is complicated by dierent usage of the term knot amongst mathematicians and biologists. For example, a typical representation of the fold of many ``cystine knot'' proteins is shown in Fig. 8E. On the basis of common usage it is intuitively reasonable to refer to such structures as knotted, however, they may clearly be untied by a non-bond-breaking geometrical transformation (Benham and Jafri, 1993), as illustrated in the series Fig. 8E±H, with structure 8H exemplifying the topologically simple nature of these molecules, equivalent to the graph diagram in Fig. 8B. In this example, the untying involves pushing the C-terminus and its associated peptide chain through the embedded ring in the middle of the knot as shown. Although such an unthreading mechanism at ®rst seems unlikely, a recent study (De Young et al., 1996) suggested that this may indeed be responsible for a very slow unfolding of human nerve growth factor. Such unthreading is clearly not possible in CCK proteins such as the cyclotides, because they do not have N- or C-termini. This may in part account for their remarkable stability and enhance their applications as potential molecular engineering frameworks.

7. Permutation of cystine knot structures As the cystine knot occurs as an embedded motif in a wide variety of cyclic and non-cyclic peptide toxins, it is of interest to examine the role of permutation of the protein termini in acyclic derivatives, or equivalently, of acyclic permutation in the cyclic derivatives. The basic question is do the positions of the peptide termini relative to cystine knot motif matter? To answer this we recently synthesized a series of truncated acyclic permutants of kalata B1 in which each of the six backbone loops was eectively cut, and examined the eects of acyclic permutation on folding, structure and activity (Daly and Craik, 2000). A schematic representation of the acyclic permutants is shown in Fig. 9. It is convenient to refer to individual peptides via the backbone loop which is cut, i.e. (1)± (6). A combination of HPLC and NMR data showed that of the six topologically distinct acyclic permutants, all folded to the native structure except (1) and (4) (Daly and Craik, 2000). This suggests that loops 1 and 4, which correspond to the sides of the embedded cystine knot are structurally very important. Opening the peptide chain in these loops produces a fundamental change in the ability of the molecule to fold to a native-like conformation, and con®rms the central role of the cystine knot motif in structural stabilization. By contrast, the other four loops can be cut and still

Conserved residues are indicated by their one-letter code, and in some cases may be replaced by highly homologous residues. For example, the Thr adjacent to Cys II is a Ser in the bracelet cyclotides, and the Ile in loop 6 is often replaced by a Leu. Residues which make up the embedded ring are shown as shaded circles. Blank circles indicate variable residues.

Fig. 8. Topological graphs of cystine knot peptides. (A) shows the common cysteine connectivity of known cystine knot peptides from plants, animals and fungi. This connectivity pattern can be redrawn to illustrate that the pattern is topologically simple, i.e., involves no line crossings in two dimensions, as shown in (B). Circularisation of the backbone, as in (C), removes this topological simplicity, as occurs in the CCK family of cyclotides. Other non-knotted arrangements of disul®de connectivities are however theoretically feasible, as shown in (D). The series (E) to (H) shows the successive unfolding of non-cyclic cystine knot peptides, demonstrating their topological simplicity and is based on a kinemage from Benham and Jafri (Benham and Jafri, 1993). The ®gure is adapted from (Craik et al., 1999).

allow folding into the native conformation, i.e., the position of the termini of the peptides does not matter, provided that the cystine knot structure remains intact. It is interesting that while the native cyclic molecule has haemolytic activity, none of the acyclic permutants was active, despite essentially adopting the native fold in four cases. This may re¯ect decreased stability of the acyclic derivatives (Daly and Craik, 2000), or an intrinsic need for a cyclic backbone for this particular biological activity. As is clear from Table 2 there are many acyclic cystine knot peptides which do exhibit a diverse range of biological activities. The suite of acyclic permutants represented in Fig. 9 also eectively allowed us to show that a range of linear cystine knot peptides with dierent topologies can exist. Fig. 10 summarizes the dierent topologies. In each case the Cys(I±IV, II±V, and III±VI) connectivity is maintained but in some cases (peptides (2) and (5)) Cys(I±IV) is the penetrating disul®de bond and in others (peptides (3) and (6)) Cys(III±VI) is the penetrating bond. Peptides (1) and (4) did not fold, and do

not contain the cystine knot motif in any case, so no example of a penetrating Cys(II±V) bond exists. The existence of examples with either Cys(I±IV) or Cys(III±VI) penetrating disul®de bonds is reminiscent of the dierentiation of growth factor and inhibitor cystine knot peptides, but all of the acyclic permutants described above are derived from the latter family. 8. Synthesis and folding of cystine knot toxins 8.1. ICK peptides Cystine knot peptides represent an attractive proposition for use as scaolds in drug design applications because of the innate stability of the fold and the extreme variability of sequences that can be accommodated. However, to eectively exploit cystine knot peptides in such applications an understanding of their synthesis and folding is required. The synthesis and folding of conotoxins have been

The Arabic numbers in parentheses represent the loops which are opened and follow the loop numbering in Table 1. Roman numerals are used to label the cysteine residues based on numbering in the native peptide (Table 1).

extensively studied because of their potential for therapeutic applications. It was originally thought that mature conotoxin sequences may not contain sucient information to produce correctly folded material because of their small size and limited sequence conservation (Olivera et al., 1990, 1991). However, many conotoxins have now been successfully synthesised and folded in vitro, including those containing the cystine knot motif such as MVIIA. A recent study showed for example that the propeptide region of the precursor is not essential for folding, but that folding eciency is increased in the presence of a C-terminal glycine,

Fig. 10. A representation of the cystine knot motif in the permutants of kalata B1. The cysteine residues are numbered using the residue numbers of native kalata B1 (Table 1) and the spacings between each of the cysteine residues are indicated with dashes. The disul®de bonds are represented as lines and the core of the cystine knot is highlighted in thick lines. The shaded line represents the disul®de bond which ``threads'' through the other two disul®de bonds. The connectivity of the cysteine residues does not change in the permutants, however the numbering of the penetrating bond does change, i.e., in permutants (1) and (4) the penetrating bond is II±V, in permutants (2) and (5) it is I±IV and in permutants (3) and (6) it is III±VI.

which is post-translationally cleaved (Price-Carter et al., 1996). The importance of the disul®de bonds in MVIIA has been examined by synthesising mutant peptides with one or more disul®de bonds removed. Each disul®de bond appears to play a role in stabilising the native conformation and in specifying the correct formation of the other two (Price-Carter et al., 1998). Similar studies have been done for conotoxin GVIA, where it was found that the Cys15±Cys26 disul®de bond was essential for activity, and that when formation of the third disul®de bond is blocked, nonnative two-disul®de species dominate (Flinn et al., 1999). In the case of MVIIA it is interesting that while each of the native disul®de bonds is ultimately important, there does not appear to be a well de®ned folding pathway. Oxidation of analogues in which individual pairs of Cys residues were replaced with Ala showed that species with two native disul®des were not formed in preference to non-native disul®des and were not signi®cantly stabilised by non-covalent interactions. However, the native two-disul®de forms appear to represent a stage of folding that is relatively compact and greatly favours formation of the third disul®de bond (PriceCarter et al., 1998). Potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor is another member of the ICK family whose folding has been extensively studied. It folds spontaneously into the native conformation in vitro through an initial stage of nonspeci®c disul®de formation, followed by disul®de reshuing, although like MVIIA, the intermediates appear to be highly heterogeneous and not native-like (Chang et al., 1994). The absence of preferred one and two-disul®de intermediates and the presence of scrambled three-disul®de intermediates contrasts with the well studied folding of BPTI, which displays native-like stable structures containing one and twodisul®de bonds during folding and unfolding (Chang and Bulychev, 2000). Folding pathways in cystine knot peptides from the squash family of protease inhibitors appear to be more speci®c than those of the conotoxins or PCI. For example, despite the sequence similarities between the trypsin inhibitors, EETI II and CMTI III it appears the in vitro folding of EETI II occurs by a faster and more ecient process. This has been attributed to the high b-turn propensity of the near C-terminal GPNG segment which is speci®c to EETI II among the squash inhibitor sequences (Le-Nguyen et al., 1993). To examine the sequence requirements of this b-turn a recent study used combinatorial library screening and established a correlation between turn propensity and folding to native structure (Wentzel et al., 1999). In the case of EETI II folding appears to proceed via a stable two-disul®de intermediate that was originally observed during the chemical synthesis of the peptide (Le-

Nguyen et al., 1989) and involves the GPNG turn as a potential folding initiation site. 8.2. CCK peptides Investigation of the synthesis and folding of CCK peptides is somewhat more challenging because of their cyclic nature. However, we have synthesized kalata B1 using two separate methods, one of which involves formation of the disul®de bonds prior to cyclisation and one which involves cyclisation prior to formation of the disul®de bonds (Daly et al., 1999b). A schematic representation of the two synthetic strategies is given in Fig. 11. Tam and coworkers have also synthesized members of the CCK peptide family, including circulin B and cyclopsychotride A, using their ``thia zip'' mechanism for cyclisation (Tam and Lu, 1998; Tam et al., 1999). We have examined the in vitro folding of reduced cyclic kalata B1 and found that it oxidizes to the native conformation very eectively. However, oxidation of a linear precursor only produced appreciable amounts of the correctly folded form when done in a hydrophobic environment, presumably because of the need to stabilize the hydrophobic residues which become exposed during correct folding (Daly et al., 1999b). Thus, cyclisation appears to facilitate formation of the native conformation. In contrast, it appears that circulin B, a more cationic peptide than kalata B1, does not fold as eciently (Tam and Lu, 1998). This may re¯ect a similar situation to the dierences observed between the trypsin inhibitors EETI II and CMTI III, where a particular turn region facilitated folding. In summary, from studies on both the ICK and CCK peptides there generally appears to be sucient information within the cystine knot sequence to fold into the native conformation and the disul®de bonds play a very important role in folding. However, there are characteristics speci®c to individual cystine knot peptides. Particular sequences, such as the GPNG sequence of EETI II and the C-terminal glycine in MVIIA can play important roles in folding. In addition, there appear to be dierences in the folding mechanisms, with PCI and MVIIA having high heterogeneity in disul®de intermediates, whereas a stable intermediate with native-like structure was isolated in the folding and unfolding of EETI II. 9. Drug design and molecular engineering The exceptional stability and well-de®ned scaolds of cystine knot peptides mean that they have promising pharmaceutical applications, both as lead molecules themselves, or as molecular frameworks for

pharmaceutical design. Here we outline some applications of these peptides in pain therapy, as antibacterials and as potential antiviral agents, and ®nish with some molecular engineering applications. The use of cystine knot peptides in pain therapy relates to the ability of MVIIA and related conotoxins to speci®cally block N-type Ca channels involved in the transmission of pain responses (Miljanich and Ramachandran, 1995). Indeed MVIIA has already passed phase III clinical trials for this application. In the design of second generation analogues it will be important to understand the basis of the selectivity for N-type Ca channels over, for example P/Q type Ca channels which would be an undesirable target (Bowersox et al., 1994). It is interesting that despite the structural and sequence similarities between MVIIA and MVIIC (Table 1), the former is selective for N-type channels and the latter is selective to P/Q channels. To help understand this dierence we recently undertook a structure±activity relationship study on MVIIA and MVIIC by synthesizing 14 loop hybrids and examining the activity at N and P/Q type calcium channels (Nielsen et al., 1999). In these hybrids each of the loops in MVIIA was replaced with the corresponding loop in MVIIC and it was found that loops 2 and 5 (arrowed in Fig. 4) made the greatest contribution to selectivity. These loops are adjacent in the structure and suggest the possibility of perhaps designing a small molecule analogue in the future that just incorporates these regions. Several of the cyclotide peptides have been shown to have antimicrobial activity (Tam et al., 1999) and although it is yet to be con®rmed, they might provide leads as new antibacterials. It has been suggested that their positive charges may be important in activity and that the initial interactions with the microbial surface may be electrostatic (Tam et al., 1999). Interestingly, it was found that two disul®de intermediates and their scrambled disul®de isomers had activity similar to the native peptides (Tam et al., 1999). Given the stable, cyclic structure of the cyclotides and their selective antimicrobial activity, they may well overcome some of the usual limitations of peptide based drugs. Several members of the cyclotide family have antiHIV activity (Gustafson et al., 1994; Gustafson et al., 2000; Hallock et al., 2000). The circulins A±F (Gustafson et al., 1994; Gustafson et al., 2000) and cycloviolins A±D (Hallock et al., 2000) were tested for HIVinhibition against ten dierent strains of HIV-1 using an in vitro XTT-tetrazolium based assay and had antiviral cytoprotective concentrations (EC50 values) ranging from 40 to 275 nM, with cytotoxic concentrations (IC50) remaining constant at around 500 nM. The mechanism of anti-HIV activity is not yet elucidated, although assay against reverse transcriptase showed no loss of activity at a concentration of 660 nM (Gustaf-

Both protocols produced fully oxidized cyclic peptide.

son et al., 1994) indicating that these peptides do not inhibit the enzyme. The dierentiation between cytotoxicity and cytoprotection may be too small to make the circulins and cycloviolins useful anti-HIV agents at present. However new members of the family or synthetic derivatives of them may have an improved therapeutic index. The peptides tested all belong to the ``bracelet'' sub-family of cyclotides and it remains to be determined if members of the Moebius subfamily also possess anti-HIV activity. In addition to their use directly as lead molecules, the stable molecular framework of cystine knot peptides makes them attractive templates in drug design. The foundation for such applications has been laid by protein engineering studies designed to establish that cystine-knot-containing peptides can accommodate sequence modi®cations. For example, an early study on two squash peptides showed that it was possible to generate a chimeric protein which retains activities of both proteins by grafting functional residues from one sequence onto another (Chiche et al., 1993). Taking the N-terminal 27 residues of EETI-II and adding the C-terminal ®ve residues from CPI did this. A more recent study on EETI-II demonstrated the potential for grafting functional amino acid sequences into the inhibitor loop (residues 3±8). This region was replaced by two epitope sequences, 13 and 17 residues in length. The peptides were expressed as fusion proteins which were found to adopt similar scaolds to wild-type EETI II. Thus, it was suggested that the inhibitor loop of the squash trypsin inhibitor would accommodate major changes in sequence without aecting the folding of the cystine knot structural scaold (Christmann et al., 1999). This and related studies (Smith et al.,

1998) have con®rmed the suitability of cystine knot peptides as eective scaolds for the surface display of conformationally constrained peptides. Many applications in combinatorial libraries are likely to follow. In conclusion, it appears that the cystine knot framework, which at ®rst seems a rather unlikely structural motif is widespread in a range of toxins from plants and animals. Its unique stability and suitability as a molecular engineering framework, combined with a range of bioactivities makes it likely that this motif will play an important role in drug design applications.
