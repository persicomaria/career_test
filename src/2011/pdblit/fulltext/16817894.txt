Cyclotides are a family of bioactive plant peptides that are characterized by a circular protein backbone and three conserved tightly packed disulfide bonds. The antimicrobial and hemolytic properties of cyclotides, along with the relative hydrophobicity of the peptides, point to the biological membrane as a target for cyclotides. To assess the membrane-induced conformation and orientation of cyclotides, the interaction of the Mobius ¨ cyclotide, kalata B1, from the African perennial plant Oldenlandia affinis, with dodecylphosphocholine micelles was studied using NMR spectroscopy. Under conditions where the cyclotide formed a well-defined complex with micelles, the spatial structure of kalata B1 was calculated from NOE and J couplings data, and the model for the peptide­micelle complex was built using 5- and 16-doxylstearate relaxation probes. The binding of divalent cations to the peptide­micelle complex was quantified by Mn2+ titration. The results show that the peptide binds to the micelle surface, with relatively high affinity, via two hydrophobic loops (loop 5, Trp19­Val21; and loop6, Leu27­Val29). The charged residues (Glu3 and Arg24), along with the cation-binding site (near Glu3) are segregated on the other side of the molecule and in contact with polar head groups of detergent. The spatial structure of kalata B1 is only slightly changed during incorporation into micelles and represents a distorted triple-stranded b-sheet cross-linked by a cystine knot. Detailed structural analysis and comparison with other knottins revealed structural conservation of the two-disulfide motif in cyclic and acyclic peptides. The results thus obtained provide the first model for interaction of cyclotides with membranes and permit consideration of the cyclotides as membrane-active cationic antimicrobial peptides.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are ubiquitous agents that play a crucial role in the host defense systems of bacteria, fungi, plants and animals [1­3]. In higher vertebrates, these peptides work in synergy with the

adaptive immune system and form the basis of `so-called' innate immunity [2]. At the same time, AMPs of plants provide one of the major barriers for invading pathogens and significantly enhance the

ability of the host to survive in an unfriendly world rich in pests and parasites [4­6]. The primary interest in AMPs comes from opportunities to use them as therapeutic agents or as models for drug design [2]. These peptides also attract much attention as possible protective agents in agriculture, especially in transgenic plants with exceptional resistance to pathogen attacks [7]. From a structural point of view, AMPs of various organisms demonstrate a large diversity of various sequences and structural folds; even peptides from individual organisms frequently show significant variability [3]. However, all these peptides (including a-helical peptides, b-structural disulfide-rich peptides and peptides without regions of defined secondary structure) share common structural properties in that they form amphiphilic structures upon contact with lipid membranes and demonstrate significant membrane activity. This is believed to be either a primary mode of peptide action (via membrane disruption that leads to lysis of the target cell) or an intermediate step that promotes penetration of AMPs through the cell membrane and their attack of intracellular targets [1­3,8]. One of the most interesting classes of plant AMPs is a recently discovered cyclotide (Fig. 1). Cyclotides are

a family of macrocyclic peptides that contain 28­37 residues and six conserved cysteines [9]. There are % 50 peptides belonging to this family isolated from various Violaceae, Rubiaceae and Cucurbitaceae plants [10]. Cyclotides demonstrate a diverse range of biological functions, including uterotonic [11], hemolytic [12­15], anti-HIV [16], antimicrobial [12], insecticidal [17,18] and cytotoxic [19,20] activities. The cyclization of backbone and three tightly packed disulfides provide unusual stability to the cyclotides, making them able to withstand boiling and protease treatment [21], and they are orally bioactive [11], which makes them `ideal' models for drug design [22]. Probably these peptides play a role as defense agents against attacks of bacteria, fungi and insects in plants. This idea is also supported by the fact that plant cyclotides are usually expressed as a mixture of homologous peptides [17]. Although much attention has been paid to structural and functional investigation of cyclotides, there is still no consensus on a disulfide-pairing scheme in these peptides [9,12,23­26] and the mechanisms of their antimicrobial action have not yet been revealed. Comparison of sequences and structures of cyclotides permit them to be divided into three groups:

Fig. 1. Sequence alignment for several cyclotides and plant knottins with determined 3D structures. The aligned amino acid sequences of the peptides are presented using a one-letter code, where N-terminal pyroglutamate in GRM is abbreviated as X and the other residues are shown with the usual codes. Alignment was performed manually on the basis of common elements of secondary structure which are shown by gray arrows (strands) and rectangles (helices) above each family of peptides. Cys residues are shown in bold and labeled by Roman numbers (I to VI); loops between them are also sequentially numbered. The numbering of residues is arbitrary for cyclic peptides, but following the proposed rule [9], we start numbering from CysI. It is different from the original numbering scheme of KB1 [23,25] where Ser18 was first. The residue numbers are shown only for KB1. For each peptide the amount of positive and negative charges, as well as net charge and PDB code(s), are cited. For cyclotides, charged residues are inverted, and hydrophobic patches are shaded.

`bracelet' cyclotides; `Mobius' cyclotides; and cyclic ¨ trypsin inhibitors (Fig. 1). These groups differ from each other by the distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues and by the presence of a conserved cis X-Pro peptide bond in the tip of the b-hairpin in `Mobius' peptides [loop 5 in Fig. 1; Pro20 in kalata B1 ¨ (KB1)]. In this study, for the first time we report the spatial structure of cyclotide in an anisotropic membrane mimetic environment, namely the solution of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The `Mobius' peptide, ¨ KB1, binds to the micelle surface with relatively high affinity via two hydrophobic loops. The charged residues (Glu3 and Arg24), along with a cage for binding of a partially dehydrated divalent cation (near Glu3), are segregated on the other side of the molecule and in contact with polar head groups of detergent. Detailed structural analysis, based on homonuclear NMR data (NOE and J couplings), along with heteronuclear 3 JC,Hb coupling constants, revealed distinct conformations for all Cys side chains and allowed a univocal conclusion to be drawn in favor of a knotted topology for disulfides of KB1. The results of the present study provide a model of the cyclotide­membrane interactions and permit classification of these peptides as cationic AMPs. We propose that the first step in cyclotide action is surface binding to the membrane of the target cell, modulated by hydrophobic and electrostatic forces. The second step possibly involves pore formation, with subsequent membrane rupture or penetration of the peptide inside the cell. The comparison of cyclotide structures explains different profiles of action for `bracelet' and `Mobius' cyclotides and complete inactivity of acyclic ¨ variants.

Results
Formation of the KB1­DPC micelle complex Formation of the complex between KB1 and the DPC micelle was studied using diffusion measurements and 1D NMR spectroscopy at 30 °C. The chemical shifts of several signals of the peptide were affected by variation of the detergent to peptide molar ratio (D:P) (Figs 2 and 3). In the limit of fast exchange between bound and free peptide species, the value of chemical shift of the affected proton simply reflects the fraction of the bound peptide at a given D:P. The changes in chemical shift of the He1 proton of Trp19 (which is in the centre of the hydrophobic region of KB1) (Fig. 2) revealed that at a D:P of % 20 : 1, approximately all the peptide was in a micelle-bound state.

The 1H chemical shifts for KB1 in water solution (pH 3.0) were taken from a previous publication [25] [BioMagnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) code 5114]. The black, gray and white bars for each residue denote changes in HN, HA and averaged 1H side chain chemical shifts. Asterisks denote residues which have protons with Dd > 0.1 p.p.m. in the pH range 2.8­6.8. The insert shows pH dependence of HN proton chemical shifts for Asn11 and Thr12.

this binding curve using the Langmuir isotherm indicated that the peptide has moderate free energy of association with micelle (DGo ¼ )5.4 ± 0.1 kcalÆ mol)1), and the site of the peptide binding on the micelle surface is formed by 4.9 ± 0.1 DPC molecules. These parameters reflect association of the peptide to the micelle surface rather than deep incorporation inside the micelle interior. The free energy of association obtained is in agreement with the affinity constant (104 mol)1) of KB1 to the dimyristoyl-la-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer measured by surface plasmon resonance [27].

The diffusion coefficient of KB1 (DT) also showed a sharp decrease upon increasing detergent content in the sample (Fig. 2), indicating the presence of KB1­ DPC complexes. A linear drop in DT at a D:P higher than 20 : 1 was the result of an increase in solvent viscosity and diffusion obstruction at a high concentration of detergent. To estimate the DT for the KB1 / DPC complex at infinite dilution, the data points in the D:P diapason from 20 : 1 to 60 : 1 were extrapolated to zero concentration of DPC. The diffusion coefficient thus obtained (1.07 ± 0.03 · 10)10 m2Æs)1) corresponds to a hydrodynamic Stokes radius (RH) of ° 26.0 ± 0.6 A. Thus, the KB1­DPC complex is slightly larger than the pure DPC micelle (DT ¼ ° m2Æs)1; RH ¼ 23.1 ± 0.5 A 1.20 ± 0.02 · 10)10 [28,29]). pH dependence of chemical shifts in the micelle-bound KB1 It was previously reported that KB1 aggregates at low ionic strength in water solutions at pH values of > 3.5 (20 mm sodium phosphate) [25]. At the same time, at intermediate ionic strengths (100 mm sodium phosphate) no evidence for KB1 association at pH 7.4 was found [30]. Such dependence of KB1 aggregation on ionic strength implies that this association process is governed by electrostatic interactions between molecules (the interaction can take place between positive Arg24 and negative Glu3). In order to estimate the impact of pH on the structure of KB1 in micellar solution, the pH dependence of the peptide chemical shifts was monitored. The variation of sample pH in diapason from 2.8 to 6.8 indicates that only several protons of Glu3, Cys5, Cys10, Asn11 and Thr12 experience significant (more than 0.1 p.p.m.) shifts (Fig. 3, asterisks). This implies that the pH of the solution does not influence the overall conformation of KB1 and possibly only slightly influences the side chain conformation of spatially neighboring Glu3 residues. At the same time, the absence of pH-dependent changes of chemical shifts in the peptide surface around Arg24 indicates the absence of pH-dependent aggregation between KB1 molecules bound to DPC micelles. The analysis of pH titration curves for Hc protons of Glu3, and for amide protons of Asn11 and Thr12, gives the same pKa value of 3.4, almost identical to the pKa of 3.5 observed in water solution [9]. The large down-field shifts of Asn11 and Thr12 amide protons (2.7 and 1.9 p.p.m., respectively, Fig. 3, insert), induced by deprotonation of the Glu3 side chain, reveals the formation of a hydrogen bond between the

Glu3 carboxylate moiety and these HN groups. The comparison of these down-field shifts with pH-dependent shifts observed in other proteins [31] indicates that hydrogen bonds between the HN groups of Asn11 and Thr12, and the carboxylate of Glu3, are dynamically stable and become significantly polarized upon deprotonation of the Glu3 side chain. The HN proton of Thr12 at pH 2.8 gives rise to two closely located signals with a 2 : 1 volume ratio and with 0.03 p.p.m. splitting between them. All other protons, including aliphatic protons of Thr12, give rise to single resonances. Both components of the Thr12 amide proton experience approximately the same downfield shift upon increasing the pH and coalesce at a pH of % 4.5. This indicates the presence of two forms of KB1 in DPC solution at acidic pH; the possible exchange between them takes place in a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. Analysis of NOESY and TOCSY cross-peaks for the two forms of the peptide showed that the observed heterogeneity does not involve changes in the Thr12 backbone or side chain conformation. Thus, the nature of the two forms of KB1 is not clear. Qualitative characterization of the KB1 conformation A summary of the NMR data obtained for KB1 in the DPC micelles solution is shown in Fig. 4A,B. The analysis of these data reveals that the secondary structure of the peptide represents a triple-stranded b-sheet, which is formed by a b-hairpin (residues from Cys15 to Arg24) and a third short, distorted, b-strand (Glu3­ Cys5). This structure is stabilized by 10 backbone­backbone hydrogen bonds, and is similar to the secondary structure of KB1 in aqueous solution [9,23,25]. The single set of signals in the NMR spectra (except HN Thr12) reveals the absence of the cis-trans X-Pro peptide bond isomers. The trans orientation of the Thr12­Pro13 and Leu27­Pro28 peptide bonds, and the cis orientation of the Trp19­Pro20 peptide bond, were established based on the sequential NOE cross-peaks [32]. The analysis of intraresidual NOE intensities and J couplings for prolines [33] reveals the conformation of all pyrrolidine rings: Pro13 and Pro28 have Down conformation, while Pro20 has averaged Twist conformation. Disulfide bond connectivity in micelle-bound KB1 One of the most intriguing questions in NMR structure determination of cyclotides in general and KB1 in particular is a disulfide bond connectivity pattern.

Fig. 4. Overview of NMR data defining the kalata B1 (KB1) secondary structure in the dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelle-bound state [detergent to peptide molar ratio (D:P) ¼ 60 : 1, pH 2.8, 40 °C]. (A) NOE connectivities, 3JHNHa coupling constants, Ha chemical shift indices (CSIs) and H-D exchange rates for HN protons (H / DEX) are shown versus the KB1 sequence. The NOE connectivities are denoted as usual, except that N denotes amide protons or Hd protons for Pro13, Pro20 and Pro28. The widths of the bars correspond to the relative intensity of the cross-peak in the 50 ms NOESY spectrum. The large (> 8.5 Hz), small (< 5 Hz) and medium (others) 3JHNHa couplings are designated by the filled triangles, squares and crosses, respectively. The filled and open circles denote HN protons with slow (half-exchange time > 10 h) and intermediate (half-exchange time > 4 h) H-D exchange rates at 30 °C, respectively. The CSIs are calculated as usual [60], and the positive and negative values denote b-strand and a-helical propensity, respectively. Elements of secondary structure are shown on a separate line; the b-strands are designated by arrows, distorted strands by dotted arrows and tight b-turns by wavy lines.

The numbers for Cys residues, which participated in b-strands, are circled.

problem arises from difficulties experienced of disulfide mapping by direct chemical methods in these cyclic and tightly packed peptides [24]. The two different
2662

models of KB1 structure were built on the basis of NMR data in solution; in the first model the six cysteines were connected in a knotted arrangement (I­IV, II­V, III­VI) [9,23], but in the second model the `laddered' topology was chosen (I­VI, II­V, III­IV) [25]. Only recently has combined chemical and MS investigation of KB1 strongly argued for the knotted topology of disulfide bonds [26]. As a result, the question now arises: can the correct disulfide pattern for KB1 be deduced from NMR data only? In principle the correct disulfide connectivity can be determined from NMR structures of a peptide calculated without restraints that force disulfide bond connectivity [9,32]. This requires precise determination of overall fold of the cyclotide and conformation of Cys side chains in a preliminary stage of structure calculation. The overall fold of the peptide is usually well defined by the homonuclear 1H NMR data (3JHH and NOE); at the same time, these data are often insufficient to define the side chain conformation of Cys residues. For example, two independent investigations of the cyclic trypsin inhibitor, MCoTI-II, carried out by two laboratories [34,35] [Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes 1IB9 and 1HA9], led to different values of v1 angles for several cysteines. In order to resolve the ambiguity in determination of Cys side chain conformation, we decided to measure 3 JC,Hb coupling constants, which depend on the v1 angle [36]. These measurements at natural 13C abundance in DPC solution are problematic owing to a large mass of KB1­micelle complex and increased line width of the peptide resonances. At the same time, the preservation of Cys residue conformation upon micelle binding (as illustrated by J couplings and 1H chemical shifts) allows the combining of 3JC,Hb, measured in a detergent-free KB1 sample, with other data obtained in DPC solution, and provides an opportunity to determine Cys v1 rotamers solely from vicinal J couplings (see Supplementary material). The set of 500 preliminary structures was calculated in cyana from 1000 random starts using all available experimental data without restraints for disulfide bonds. The statistics for this set of structures is shown in Table 1. The set of structures has low cyana target function and residual restrains violations and quite a low rmsd value for backbone atoms, thus indicating that the structure of KB1 is defined accurately and precisely by experimental data without restraints on disulfide bonding. Analysis of pairwise distances between Sc atoms of Cys residues in this set of structures (Table 2) reveals a unique pattern of disulfide bridges, namely a knotted arrangement [Cys1(I)­Cys15(IV), Cys5(II)­Cys17(V), and Cys10(III)­Cys22(VI)].

arrangement of disulfides corresponds to all structural data obtained. Spatial structure of micelle-bound KB1 The ribbon representation of the spatial structure of KB1 in micelle-bound form is shown in Fig. 5A. The peptide from Cys15 to Arg24 represents a b-hairpin, with Trp19 and Pro20 situated on its tip; these residues form a type VIa b-turn. The other part of the molecule represents a prolonged loop that encloses the cyclical structure. This loop connects with the b-hairpin by two tight b-turns [Arg24­Leu27 (type I¢) and Thr12­ Cys15 (type II)] and involves an inverse c-turn (Leu27­Val29) and a type I b-turn (Cys5­Gly8). The whole structure is cross-linked by a cystine knot formed by three disulfide bridges. These bridges have the conformation g+nnng+ Cys(I­IV), g­pppt Cys(II­ V) and g+nnng+ Cys(III­VI) (see the Experimental procedures for definition). The maps of electrostatic (Fig. 5B) and molecular (Fig. 5C) hydrophobicity potentials on the surface of KB1 illustrate the amphiphilic nature of the peptide. One side of the molecule, formed by one strand of the b-hairpin and loops 2 and 6 (see Fig. 1 for the definition of loops), contains all the bulky hydrophobic side chains (Val6, Trp19, Val21, Leu27 and Val29); the charged side chains of Glu3 and Arg24 protrude to the other side of the molecule. Divalent cation-binding site in micelle-bound KB1 It has been proposed that KB1 in water solution can bind divalent cations at a site near the side chain of Glu3 [25]. In order to reveal a distinct position of bound cation, we performed Mn2+ titration on the sample containing KB1­DPC complexes (KB1 2.0 mm, D:P 60 : 1, pH 5.0, where the carboxylic group of Glu3 is fully charged). The transverse relaxation rate (R2) for several HN protons of the peptide increased linearly upon an increasing MnCl2 concentration in the sample (Fig. 6), and at the KB1 / Mn2+ molar ratio of 1 : 1.5, the resonances of several residues in the peptide became strongly attenuated (Fig. 7A). The analysis of possible sources of paramagnetic attenuation (according to the methods outlined previously [37]) revealed that neither relaxation enhancement induced by freely diffusing Mn2+ ions nor relaxation enhancement induced by Mn2+ ions bound to the head groups of detergent can explain the magnitude of the effects observed. Thus, observed relaxation enhancement originates from specific binding of the paramagnetic ion to the KB1 surface. The exact position of bound

The structural statistics for this set of KB1 structures are also shown in Table 1. These data indicate that the addition of disulfide bonds restraints does not significantly increase the cyana target function and residual restrains violations, but significantly increases structural convergence, reducing the rmsd value for backbone atoms.

cation was calculated using dependences of R2 from Mn2+ concentration for 12 HN protons, which give nonoverlapping signals in a 1D spectrum. As shown in Fig. 5, the bound Mn2+ cation (black sphere) is co-ordinated on the polar face of KB1 by the charged side chain of Glu3, the polar side chain of Asn11 and by carbonyls of Thr4 and Thr9.

Fig. 6. Dependence of the transverse relaxation rate for several protons of kalata B1 (KB1) from the Mn2+ concentration [2.0 mM KB1, detergent to peptide molar ratio (D:P) ¼ 60 : 1, pH 5.0, 40 °C].

On the other hand, by using the direct equation for R2 paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (Eqn 6, Experimental procedures) and assuming that the correlation time for the relaxation process induced by bound Mn2+ (sC) is smaller than or equal to the rotational correlation time of the KB1­DPC complex (sR) (Eqn 7), we find that Kd < 90 mm [the approximate estimate of sR (% 14 ns) can be obtained from RH]. Thus, KB1 in a complex with a DPC micelle binds Mn2+ cations with an affinity of 10­90 mm. Model of the peptide­micelle complex In order to elucidate the location of KB1 in DPC micelles, we used the relaxation probes technique [28,29,38]. The 5- and 16-doxylstearate relaxation probes were incorporated into the DPC micelle with the nitroxide moiety being preferentially located close to the surface and the center of the micelle, respectively [38]. Specific broadening of the KB1 proton signals was monitored using NOESY spectra at the DPC / probe molar ratio of 60 : 1 (i.e. c. one relaxation probe per micelle). To characterize the effect of the relaxation probes on the KB1 protons, we compared the amplitudes of selected intraresidual cross-peaks with and without probes (Fig. 7B). Although both relaxation probes produced similar attenuation curves, 5-doxylstearate attenuated cross-peak intensities more strongly than 16-doxylstearate, thus indicating the surface mode of peptide binding to micelle. The data (Fig. 7B) indicate that two parts of the molecule (Gly26­Val29­Cys1­Gly7 and Ser18­Cys22) are immersed into the micelle interior and form the interaction interface in the peptide­micelle complex.

Attenuation of intensities of selected cross-peaks (HN-Ha for amino acid residues and Hd2-Hd3 for prolines) in the 100 ms NOESY spectra of the kalata B1 (KB1) / dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) complex by the paramagnetic probes: (A) 3 mM of water-soluble MnCl2 [2.0 mM KB1, detergent to peptide molar ratio (D:P) ¼ 60 : 1, pH 5.0, 40 °C]; and (B) 1.8 mM of lipid-soluble 16-doxylstearate (open squares, dashed line) or 5-doxylstearate (open triangles, solid line) (1.8 mM KB1, D:P ¼ 60 : 1, pH 2.8, 40 °C). The sequence of the peptide and intercysteine loops are shown. The 80% threshold line at (B) subdivides data points in two groups: the residues situated inside or outside the micelle.

The model of the KB1­DPC complex was built using the obtained spatial structure of KB1 and data on signal attenuation induced by 5-doxylstearate. As shown in Fig. 5, the peptide interacts with the micelle surface by two hydrophobic swellings. One of these comprises the tip of the b-hairpin and the tip of loop 2 (residues Cys17­Cys22 and Val6­Gly7); the other involves two turns in loop 6 (residues Gly26­Val29). The backbone of the distorted b-strand and the neighboring residues in loop 1 (Cys1­Cys5) are also in contact with the micelle surface. The pH titration of samples containing spin probes from pH 2.8 to 4.8 (where the carboxylic group of Glu3 is fully charged) did not show any pH-dependent changes in the attenuation of proton signals in the

peptide. Thus, the proposed model for the KB1­DPC complex is also valid for physiological pH.

Discussion
Model for membrane activity of KB1 In spite of large structural diversity, the membrane-active AMPs have several common properties essential for activity. These properties involve hydrophobicity and overall cationic charge [2,3]. However, for the optimal membrane activity of a peptide, hydrophobic and charged residues should be segregated on the molecule surface [2,3]. In this respect, the cyclotide KB1 is exceptionally suited to interaction with the interface of the phospholipid membrane. The peptide has a large hydrophobic surface (formed from several noncontiguous loops) and interacts with the DPC micelle (an anisotropic membrane mimetic) without deep penetration inside the micelle interior (Fig. 5). The belt of polar and charged side chains is situated above the hydrophobic swellings, and these polar side chains, including Glu3 and Arg24, probably interact with the polar head groups of detergent (Fig. 5). Therefore, the hydrophobic and partially electrostatic contributions of peptide­membrane interactions were modeled in the present study. The peptide affinity to real anionic microbial membranes can be substantially enhanced by the specific binding of divalent cation to the peptide surface near Glu3 (Fig. 5). The binding of, for example, ubiquitous Ca2+ at this site should modify the total charge of the peptide (from 0 to +2). This makes KB1 cationic and, in addition, increases the peptide amphipathicity. Upon interaction with the microbial membrane, the bound cation screens the positive charge of the Glu3 side chain and contacts with anionic lipid head groups, thus increasing the membrane activity of the peptide. Using experimental data on paramagnetic attenuation (Fig. 7) we can delineate the regions in the KB1 sequence that are responsible for hydrophobic and electrostatic determinants of peptide­membrane interactions. Loops 1, 2, 5 and 6 in the cyclotide sequence form the site of micelle binding and are responsible for hydrophobic interactions with the membrane (Fig. 7B), while loops 1, 2 and 3 are responsible for cation coordination (Fig. 7A). Thus, virtually all of the cyclic backbone of KB1 is important for membrane activity; the remaining loop 3 is structurally important, as it consists of only one Thr16 residue, which connects two cysteines. The structure­function investigation of KB1 confirms this proposal. Indeed, the rupture of the KB1 cyclic backbone at any of six loops completely inactivates the peptide, as illustrated by hemolytic and

antiviral assays [13­16]. At the same time, the cystine knot is not essential for peptide activity; the two-disulfide isomer of the cyclotide displays only a marginal reduction in antimicrobial activity [12]. Conformation of Cys knots in cyclotides and other knottins The overall fold of KB1 represents a distorted triplestranded b-sheet cross-linked by a cystine knot and resembles the knottin-fold, the structural motif that is widely distributed among enzyme inhibitors, toxins and AMPs from plants and animals (Fig. 1, Fig. 8) [22,39,40]. The rigid core of the knottin-fold is formed by two disulfide bridges [Cys(II­V) and Cys(III­VI)], which have conserved spatial position in all peptides belonging to this family [39]. At the same time, the position of the Cys(I­IV) disulfide is varied among different peptides [39,40]. The ancestral structural fold, comprising only two disulfides and a triple-stranded b-sheet, was named the cystine-stabilized b-sheet motif (CSB) [41] or disulfide-directed b-hairpin motif (DDH) [42], and now large amounts of peptides and proteins containing this motif (with or without additional disulfide bonds) have been found in various species from fungi to higher vertebrates. In order to make better structural comparison between cyclotides and peptides containing CSB, DDH or knottin-fold, we analyzed the presently available high-resolution spatial structures of these peptides in terms of disulfide conformation (see the Experimental procedures).

The positions of half-cystine residues are marked. The disulfide bridges that form the cystine knot are shown. The two conserved disulfides are highlighted.

Membrane-binding motif of kalata B1

As a result, it was found that `bracelet' and `Mob¨ ius' cyclotides (cycloviolacin O1 [9], VHL-1 [43], KB1 in aqueous solution [9], KB1 in micellar solution (present work), KB2 [18], KB7 (Z. O. Shenkarev et al., unpublished) have identical conformation of the cystine knot [g+nnng+ Cys(I­IV), g­pppt Cys(II­V) and g+nnng+ Cys(III­VI)]. At the same time, the cyclic trypsin inhibitor, MCoTI-II [34,35] (cyclotide from Cucurbitaceae), has a different structure of knot. This structure [t+ppng+ Cys(I­IV), g­pppt Cys(II­V) and g+nnng+ Cys(III­VI)] is identical to the structure of the knot in acyclic trypsin inhibitors from Cucurbitaceae (Fig. 1). Thus, a two-disulfide motif [g­pppt Cys(II­V) and g+nnng+ Cys(III­VI)] is conformationally conserved in the cyclotide family of peptides. The analysis of high-resolution spatial structures for other peptides containing CSB, DDH or knottin-fold indicates that the majority of the peptides (more than 80% of structures, see the Supplementary material) have an analogous conformation of a conserved twodisulfide motif. Thus, the disulfide bridge conformation can be included in the definition of cyclotide, knottin, CSB and DDH scaffolds, along with positions of halfcystine residues, relative to a triple-stranded b-sheet (Fig. 8). Interestingly, one of the half-cystines (CysIII) is not fixed in the b-sheet, and therefore conservation of its conformation should be caused mostly by the energy of Van der Waals contacts between two disulfides. The possible difference in modes of peptide­membrane interactions for `bracelet' and `Mobius' cyclotides ¨ The `bracelet' and `Mobius' cyclotides (Fig. 1) are two ¨ peptide families that contain molecules with antimicrobial, antiviral and cytotoxic activities [10]. As noted above, members of both families share the following common structural elements: a conserved triple-stranded b-sheet and three knot-forming disulfides. Thus, the different activity profile for `bracelet' and `Mobius' ¨ peptides [12,16,19,20] points to the structure of intercysteine loops as a major determinant for biological activity. Assuming that the primary target for cyclotide action is a biological membrane, we can compare structures of `bracelet' and `Mobius' cyclotides in ¨ terms of determinants for membrane activity. These determinants (revealed in the present study on example of KB1) involve (a) a site for divalent cation co-ordination that increases total charge and peptide amphipathicity, and (b) the distribution of hydrophobic regions on a peptide surface that determines the mode of peptide­membrane interaction.

Comparison of published sequences and structures for `bracelet' and `Mobius' cyclotides indicates that the ¨ site of divalent cation co-ordination is inherent to both families. The relative placement of the carboxylate moiety of the absolutely conserved Glu3 residue in loop 1, and exposed carbonyls of Thr / Ser4 and Thr / Ser / Pro9 or Phe / Val10 in loops 1 and 2, is preserved in all cyclotide 3D structures determined to date. In the absence of bound cations, the overall charge of cyclotides has a distribution from )2 to +2, and thus the binding of divalent cation makes cyclotides neutral or slightly cationic. On the other hand, the cyclotides from two families have a dissimilar distribution of hydrophobic regions on a peptide surface. The hydrophobic patch in `Mob¨ ius' cyclotides is composed of fragments from loops 5 and 6 (Fig. 1); thus, all of these peptides probably interact with the membrane in a KB1-like manner predominantly at the tip of the b-hairpin and at the third b-strand. On the contrary, the `bracelet' cyclotides have a hydrophobic region in loops 2 and 3 (Fig. 1); thus, these peptides could interact with membrane via the loop region between the first and the second b-strands. Interestingly, this region involves a short a-helix, the structural feature that is absent in `Mob¨ ius' cyclotides. Inspection of 3D structures of cyclotides from both families indicates that in all cases the divalent cation-binding site is situated directly above hydrophobic patches and thus the co-ordinated cation can take part in peptide­membrane interactions by binding to the lipid head groups. In summary, we can classify `bracelet' and `Mobius' ¨ cyclotides as cationic AMPs and speculate about possible mechanisms of their action. We propose that membrane interactions play a major role in their antibiotic activity. The first step in a cyclotide action is the surface binding of a monomeric peptide to the membrane of target cell, modulated by hydrophobic and electrostatic forces. (This step for KB1 is partially modeled in the present study.) The second step possibly involves the pore formation by peptide oligomers, with subsequent membrane rupture or penetration of the peptide inside the cell, as proposed for other AMPs [8,44]. Different activity profiles for `Mobius' and ¨ `bracelet' cyclotides can be explained by different modes of peptide­membrane interaction.

Experimental procedures
Sample preparation and NMR spectroscopy
KB1 was purified as described previously [45]. The purity of the peptide was checked by analytical HPLC. The

mass of the peptide (2892.4 Da), as determined by MALDI-MS, was identical to that previously reported [23]. The homogeneity and purity of the peptide sample was also established by NMR during resonance assignments. The samples used for structure determination consisted of various concentrations of KB1 in mixtures of H2O, D2O and DPC (98% deuterium; CIL, Andover, MA, USA) without explicitly added buffer (see below). Adjustments to the pH were made via the addition of concentrated HCl or NaOH. The DPC and 5- or 16doxylstearates (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) were added to the sample using lyophilized aliquots of stock solutions in H2O and methanol, respectively. Metal binding was carried out using a stock solution of MnCl2 in H2O. All NMR experiments were performed on Varian Unity600 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or Bruker DRX-500 (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) spectrometers. Unless otherwise stated, a relaxation delay of 1.4 s was used. The WATERGATE [46] technique was used to suppress strong solvent resonance in spectra measured in H2O solution. For the diffusion measurements, a slightly modified version of the spin echo experiment [47] was used [29]. All 2D NMR experiments were recorded in the States-TPPI manner. 1H chemical shifts were measured relative to the residual protons of H2O, the chemical shift of the signal being arbitrary chosen as 4.65 p.p.m. at 40 °C. 13C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly.

Spectral assignment and spatial structure calculation
Proton resonance assignments for KB1 in the DPC solution (D:P ¼ 60 : 1, 40 °C, pH 2.8) were obtained by a standard procedure [48] using DQF-COSY [49], CLEAN-MLEV [50] and NOESY [51] spectra in the xeasy program [52]. The assignment for the natural abundance 13C sample of KB1 dissolved in pure D2O (3.6 mm, 40 °C, pH 2.8) was obtained by the combined use of gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple bond correlation [53] and heteronuclear single quantum correlation [54] and by relying on previously published proton assignments [23,25]. The 3JHNHa coupling constants were determined from line shape analysis of NOESY cross-peaks in the program mathematica (Wolfram research, Champaign, IL, USA). The 3JHaHb and 3JHbHc coupling constants were measured using acme [55] in the COSY spectrum of the KB1 / DPC sample in D2O solution (relaxation delay of 2.5 s). The 3 JC,Hb coupling constants (for 3.6 mm KB1 in D2O without detergent) were measured by a slightly modified quantitative correlation protocol [56]. The cross information was extracted from 13CO-1Hb(12Cb) cross-peak intensities in long-range, band-selective, phase-sensitive, refocused HMQC spectrum. The two delays for evolution of longrange heteronuclear J couplings were 40 ms. The reference information was extracted from Hb(12Cb)-Hb(12Cb) crosspeak intensities in the homonuclear NOESY spectrum (sm 200 ms), which was measured with an additional 80 ms spin-echo element before acquisition. The spatial structure calculation was performed using the simulated annealing / molecular dynamics protocol, as implemented in the cyana program, version 1.1 [57]. The cyclical backbone of KB1 was represented in cyana as a linear polypeptide chain with the N terminus on Gly8 and the C terminus on Gly7. Upper interproton distance constraints were derived from NOESY (sm ¼ 50 ms) cross-peaks via an `1 / r6' calibration. The torsion angle constraints were obtained from J coupling constants and NOE intensities. The analysis of preliminary structures allows the introduction of additional constraints. The ° lower distance constraints (3.0 A), based on the expected cross-peaks but not present in the NOESY spectra with sm ¼ 100 ms, were introduced. Ten backbone­backbone hydrogen bonds involving slowly exchanged backbone amide protons, and three hydrogen bonds involving side chains (He1 Trp19­CO Val6; HN Asn11 and Thr12­ COOH Glu3) were also restrained. The first cycles of structure calculations were made without assumption of disulfide bond connectivity. In order to allow all possible Cys pairing, the van der Waals radii of Sc atoms were set to zero. After analysis of the structures obtained, the knotted topology of disulfides was established, and a final set of structures was calculated with additional restraints for SS bonding.

KB1 binding to the DPC micelle
Titration of KB1 / H2O (10% D2O) (3.6 mm) with DPC was performed at 30 °C, pH 2.8. The 1D NMR spectrum was acquired and the diffusion rate of the KB1­DPC complex was measured at each detergent concentration (from 7.2 to 216 mm). The adsorption isotherm of KB1 to the surface of the DPC micelles was measured assuming that the observed chemical shift of the He1 proton of Trp19 (dobs) depends on the chemical shift in the bound state (dbound), the chemical shift in the free state (dfree) and on the bound peptide to free peptide ratio: dobs ¼ dfree ½KB1free þ dbound ½KB1bound ½KB10 ;

Modeling of the KB1/DPCÆMn2+ complex
Titration of the KB1 / DPC sample (2.0 mm, D:PD ¼ 60 : 1) with MnCl2 was performed at 40 °C, pH 5.0. A 1D NMR spectrum was acquired for each Mn2+ concentration (from 0.03 to 7.2 mm) and the line-widths of nonoverlapped signals were extracted using nonlinear fitting in the program mathematica. Additionally, NOESY spectra (sm ¼ 100 ms) were measured at concentrations of 0 and 3.0 mm MnCl2 . Titration of KB1 / DPC samples (1.8 mm, D:P ¼ 60 : 1) with 5-doxylstearate or 16-doxylstearate was performed at 40 °C. NOESY spectra (sm ¼ 100 ms) were measured at 0 and 1.8 mm doxylstearate at pH 2.8 and 4.8. The paramagnetic relaxation enhancement induced by Mn2+ or doxylstearates was qualitatively characterized by cross-peak attenuation in NOESY spectra: Attenuationi ¼

where x is the 1H spectrometer frequency, cI is the proton gyromagnetic ratio, S is the total electron spin (½), g is the Lande g factor (c. 2), b is the Bohr magneton, and r is the distance between the proton and the Mn2+ ion. sC, the effective correlation time for the paramagnetic relaxation process, is given by:

where Iiprobe and Ii0 are the HN-Ha cross-peak intensities (Hd2­Hd3 for prolines) in the spectra of sample with and without a paramagnetic probe. The Mn2+ paramagnetic relaxation enhancement was quantified observing an increase in the R2 value for the peptide protons in response to an increasing concentration of Mn2+. The R2 values were recalculated from measured line-widths. In the limit of fast exchange between bound and free Mn2+, the R2 for the proton of the peptide is given by: R2 ¼ R0 þ ðRD þ RH Þ½Mn2þ free þ 2 2 2 RB ½KB1/DPC Á Mn2þ  2 ð4Þ; ½KB1/DPC0

where sM is the lifetime of bound Mn2+, sE is the relaxation time of Mn2+ electrons and sR is the effective correlation time for re-orientation of the 1H-Mn2+ vector (approximate rotational correlation time of the KB1 / DPCÆMn2+ complex). Coordinates of bound Mn2+ were obtained via simultaneous nonlinear fitting of Eqn (6¢) to experimental data for several HN protons in the program mathematica, assuming equal A (or sC) values. The model of the KB1­micelle complex was built in the mathematica program using an approach described previously [29]. The HN and Ha atoms (Hd2 and Hd3 for prolines), for which 100 ms NOESY cross-peaks were attenuated by 5-doxylstearate (pH 2.8) by > 80%, were restricted to be inside the micelle, and the other HN and Ha atoms (Hd2 and Hd3 for prolines) were restricted to be outside the micelle.

where R0 is the proton transverse relaxation rate in solution 2 D H B without paramagnetic ions, R2 , R2 and R2 are the paramagnetic relaxation enhancements induced by freely diffusing Mn2+ ions, ions bound to head groups of detergent and ions specifically bound to the peptide, respectively. The concentration of specifically bound Mn2+ ions (concentration of KB1 / DPCÆMn2+ complexes) and concentration of nonbound to KB1 ions ([Mn2+]free) can be evaluated from the initial concentration and the Kd of the KB1 / DPCÆMn2+ complex:

Analysis of Cys-knot conformation in knottins
The structures of knottins listed in the KNOTTIN database [39] (http://www.knottin.com), along with structures of polypeptides containing CSB or DDH motifs [41,42], were analyzed in terms of disulfide bond conformation. The atomic coordinates for these structures were taken from the PDB [58] (http://www.pdb.org). The 42 spatial structures, representing 32 nonredundant structures, were selected from 103 PDB entries for analysis (PDB codes 1NB1, 1ZNU, 1PT4, 1ZA8, 1NBJ, 1IB9, 1HA9, 1LU0, 1PPE, 2STA, 2CTI, 3CTI, 2BTC, 2STB, 1H9H, 1H9I, 1F2S, 1MCT, 1H20, 4CPA, 1HTX, 1CLV, 1C4E, 1AG7, 1FEO, 1MVI, 1TTK, 1DW5, 1OMC, 2CCO, 1CNN, 1FU3, 1G1Z, 1AV3, 1 DL0, 1HVW, 1G9P, 1HP3, 1KQH, 1LPB, 1H59, 2CBH). This set of structures involves crystal struc° tures with resolution £ 2.5 A and ensembles of NMR structures with rmsd of coordinates of knot-forming Cys ° heavy atoms (Ca, Cb and Sc) £ 0.35 A (the structures in the ensemble were superimposed on these atoms). v1 angles were classified as usual: ()30° to )90°) ­ g+, (+ 30° to
