Abstract The protein Mop from Haemophilus influenzae is a member of the molbindin family of proteins. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), Mop was observed to bind molybdate at two distinct sites with a stoichiometry of 8 mol molybdate per Mop hexamer. Six moles of molybdate bound endothermically at high affinity sites (Ka = 8.5 · 107 MÀ1), while 2 mol of molybdate bound exothermically at lower affinity sites (Ka = 3.7 · 107 MÀ1). Sulphate was also found to bind weakly at the higher affinity sites. ITC revealed that the affinity of molybdate binding to the endothermic site decreased with increasing pH and was accompanied by the transfer from the buffer to the protein of one proton per Mop monomer. These kinetic and thermodynamic results are interpreted with reference to molbindin crystal structures and data concerning molbindin binding affinities. Mop binds molybdate with high specificity, capacity, and affinity which indicates that Mop has a role as an intracellular molybdate binding protein involved in oxyanion homeostasis.

A distinct molybdate binding domain has been observed as a part of several regulatory proteins and transporters [1]. This small domain of 69 amino acids has been designated as a feature of the molbindin family of proteins [2]. One member of the molbindin family is the protein Mop from Haemophilus influenzae. The molbindins bind molybdate, which is the tetrahedral oxyanion of molybdenum (MoO42À). Molybdenum is unusual, being the only second row transition metal that is essential for life [3]. It is involved at the catalytic site of over 30 very different enzymes [4]. Specific cellular transport systems must distinguish between molybdate and chemically similar oxyanions such as sulphate, phosphate,

and vanadate. Historically, it was thought that molybdenum uptake took place via the sulphate transport system [5]. However, it is now known that a specific molybdate transport system exists in bacteria, which is more than 100 times as effective than the sulphate transport system for molybdate uptake [6]. Recently, our understanding of this system has improved as more information concerning molybdate storage and homeostasis has been gathered through the investigation of these simplest of molybdate binding domains, the molbindins. Molbindins are composed of one or two mop domains. To date, several molbindins have been crystallised: Mop from Clostridium pasteurianum [7], Mop from Sporomusa ovata [8], and also the di-mop domain ModG from Azotobacter vinelandii [9]. The mono-mop domains arrange themselves as a trimer of dimers and the di-mop domains are trimeric, thus mop domains

are hexameric in their native conformations. Molbindins have been found to bind a total of eight oxyanions per hexameric mop domain [8]. Furthermore, binding has been documented as occurring at two types of sites. One type is found along the trimeric axis of symmetry in the middle of the three domains (type 1), the second (type 2) lies between faces of the dimers, with three sites on each half of the molecule. So, two oxyanions can bind at type 1 sites and six at type 2 sites which gives a total of 8 mol molybdate bound per mop hexamer. Data have now emerged regarding the biophysical properties of molybdate binding proteins. For molbindins, the initial data discovered an affinity for molybdate at type 1 sites as 6.2 · 106 MÀ1, an order of magnitude greater than the affinity of type 2 sites [10]. There are also data concerning mop domains that are components of more complex multi-domain proteins. For example, the regulatory protein ModE has an association constant for molybdate of 1.3 · 106 MÀ1 [11]. The molbindins have also been shown to bind other oxyanions such as chromate and tungstate [12]. Molybdenum binding proteins are thought to exhibit selectivity based primarily on oxyanion size [13], in which oxyanions of ° similar size to molybdate (Mo­O bondlength = 1.73 A) ° ) bind in such as tungstate (W­O bondlength = 1.74 A an extremely analogous fashion. Smaller oxyanions such ° as sulphate (S­O bondlength = 1.43 A) still interact with the protein, but less favorably. In this report, we characterise oxyanion binding to the protein Mop from H. influenzae. Ligand binding studies on the protein show the amount of molybdenum bound, the number of binding sites, and the thermodynamics of this association. We also document the thermodynamics of sulphate binding to Mop and that protonation of a residue in type 2 sites occurs due to molybdate binding. Molbindin crystal structures confirm our thermodynamic results with respect to binding specificity and affinity.

which were then incubated at 37 °C with shaking. At OD600 = 0.7 (5 h), overexpression was induced by the addition of IPTG to a concentration of 1 mM. Overexpression was carried out for 2 h after which cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 15 min in a Sorvall RC5C centrifuge at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then collected and frozen overnight at À20 °C. It was thawed and resuspended in 100 ml of 100 mM Tris­Cl, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were lysed by two freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. DNAse 1 (1 lg/ ml) was added to the lysed cells to digest DNA. After 60 min at 20 °C, cell-free extract was prepared by centrifugation at 15,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. This cell-free extract was stored at À20 °C until required. Protein purification For protein purification, the cell-free extract was brought to 70% saturating ammonium sulphate and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. This was followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, performed using phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) in an XK 16 column. This was equilibrated at 40% saturating ammonium sulphate in 20 mM Tris­ Cl, pH 7.8. Twenty millilitre of protein at 70% saturating ammonium sulphate was loaded on the column using a 50 ml superloop. Protein was eluted from the column with a reversed-phase linear gradient of 40­0% saturating ammonium sulphate. Following the phenylSepharose separation, 2 ml of concentrated protein was further purified using a Superose 12 HR 16/50 size exclusion column (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated and eluted in 50 mM Tris­Cl, pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl. The protein was chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the overexpressed protein after gel filtration were finally purified by ion exchange chromatography. Twenty millimolar Tris­Cl at pH 7.8 was used with a Mono-Q column. Protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient from 100 to 150 mM NaCl. Protein characterization

Materials and methods Protein expression A plasmid construct (pMop) containing the mop gene of H. influenzae inserted into the overexpression vector pET11a was transformed into E. coli B834(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells made competent using calcium chloride treatment [14]. B834(DE3)pLysS cells containing pMop were selected by growth on LA plates containing 50 lg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm50) and 200 lg/ml ampicillin (Amp200). A single colony was used to inoculate a 200 ml LB culture with Cm50 and Amp200, which was incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 2 h. One microlitre of this was added to each of six 3 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml LB with Cm50 and Amp200, The concentration of purified Mop was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm using an estimated extinction coefficient (0.18) based on the primary amino acid sequence of the protein [15]. Mass spectrometry was performed with the PE Biosystems Voyager DE-STR System 4180 MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems). The sample matrix used was a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Mop in 50 mM Tris­Cl, pH 7.6, was diluted 1:1 with freshly prepared matrix. A 1 ll aliquot was applied to the sample slide and allowed to dry prior to data acquisition. All data were background corrected and smoothed post-acquisition.

Native weight was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, Beckman/ Coulter) using a double sector filled Epon centerpiece. Radial optical densities were measured at 280 nm. Sedimentation equilibrium was determined by direct numerical fitting of the sedimentation profiles [16] or estimated by plotting the natural log of the radius from the sedimenting boundary midpoint versus time. The partial specific volume of Mop was estimated from its amino acid composition [17]. One microlitre Mop samples were separated on an IEF gel with a gradient from pH 3 to 9 (Pharmacia) and electrofocused using the PhastSystem apparatus according to manufacturerÕs instructions (Pharmacia). Twelve standard proteins (IEF mix 3.6­9.3, Sigma) were run on the same gel. Gels were visualised by Coomassie stain. Native gel electrophoresis was carried out using the PhastGel system for an acrylamide gel with gradient from 8 to 25% (Pharmacia). The mobility of the protein at varied concentrations of molybdate, tungstate, phosphate, and sulphate was measured for the ligand concentration range of 0­100 mM. One microlitre of protein (0.5 mg/ml) with or without ligand was electrophoresed according to manufacturerÕs instructions. Gels were visualised with Coomassie stain. Molybdenum content was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).1 Two milligrams per millilitre of Mop was diluted in a 1% HNO3 solution for analysis by ICP-MS. ICP-MS was performed using an Ultramass 700 (Varian) in peak-hopping mode. The apparatus was calibrated using a 1% HNO3 solution containing molybdenum at 5, 10, and 50 ppb for all isotopes of molybdenum. Molybdenum-bound Mop (1 mg/ml) was also analysed by ICP-MS. The metal-bound species was created by saturating the protein in 100 mM molybdate then separating the free molybdate from the metal-bound protein using a 25 ml econo-column (Bio-Rad) packed with Sephadex G25 (Pharmacia). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was carried out using a Microcal MCS microcalorimeter [18]. Two-microlitre aliquots of molybdate or sulphate were added to Mop (5­20 lM) in 50 mM Tris­Cl, pH 7.6. Ligands were also made in 50 mM Tris­Cl, pH 7.6. Ligand injections lasted 1.48 s and were separated by 150 s intervals. Final concentrations of ligand in the cell were typically 0.04­4 mM. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Data were corrected for heats of dilution calculated independently in an experiment without protein. Data were fitted using Microcal Origin software (Microcal). A reverse titration of protein into molybdate was carried out by injecting 1.2 mM Mop into 15 lM molyb-

date. This experiment was carried out in 50 mM Tris­Cl, pH 7.6 at 25 °C. Mop reached a final concentration in the cell of 5 lM. The effect on molybdate binding in buffers with different heats of ionisation was investigated using ITC with 50 mM Bicine, 50 mM Tris­Cl, and 50 mM Hepes at pH 7.6, 25 °C. Heats of ionisation for these buffers had been previously calculated [19]. Using ITC, a brief investigation into the effect of pH on molybdate binding was carried out over the range pH 7­9. These experiments were carried out in 50 mM Tris­Cl at 25 °C.

Results Mass determination The molecular mass of the purified protein was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, triplicate measurements giving an average mass of 7122.1 Da (predicted mass 7122.3 Da). The native molecular weight was found to be 41,000 Da using ultracentrifugation, consistent with a native hexameric conformation for the protein. Gel electrophoresis The Mop protein was focused on an IEF gel together with 12 protein standards of known pI. A graph of mobility vs. pI was constructed to establish the pI of Mop as 5.7. Native PAGE using 8­25% acrylamide gels showed that Mop migrated in an electric field with an apparent overall negative charge. Addition of the oxyanions molybdate and tungstate resulted in increased Mop mobility, which indicated the protein had an increased negative charge and/or a smaller volume. Tungstate had the same effect as molybdate, which bound Mop at concentrations above 0.01 mM. No effect of sulphate, phosphate or vanadate was observed using native gel electrophoresis. This may be due to the lower affinity of these ligands or that the ligands were unbound during electrophoresis. Molybdenum content of molybdate-bound Mop As described under Materials and methods, a Mop species fully loaded with molybdate was generated and then the free ligand (and some of the bound molybdate) was removed by size exclusion chromatography for analysis of the protein by ICP-MS. At 1 mg/ml Mop, there was 85.75 ppb molybdenum, showing Mop had 6.7 ± 0.2 mol of molybdate bound per Mop hexamer. This suggests that after removal of the free ligand, at least six Mop binding sites remained occupied with molybdate.

ITC of molybdate titrated into Mop ITC revealed that Mop bound molybdate at two types of site with very different heats of reaction and different affinities (Table 1, Fig. 1). Six moles of molybdate bound endothermically with high affinity. A further 2 mol of ligand bound with a lower affinity which was highly exothermic. This is consistent with the Mop hexamer binding 8 mol molybdate. Data were fitted using Microcal Origin software for a model with two sets of non-identical non-interacting sites. ITC of Mop titrated into molybdate A reverse titration of Mop into molybdate was used to help deconvolute the data from two non-identical sites (Fig. 2). This type of experiment can be used to determine the total heat from binding at both sites because initial injections of protein are saturated with ligand, and this results in binding at both sites (DH1 + DH2). The heat equal to the added heats of binding for both sites was calculated as À7 ± 0.5 kcal/ mol. Also, the titration of Mop into a limiting concentration of metal results in competition between the two sets of ligand binding sites on the protein. As the concentration of Mop increased, competition between binding sites resulted in the removal of metal from the low affinity binding site by the high affinity binding site. This reaction was highly endothermic and occurred rapidly as a result of the difference in site binding affinities and a ratio of three high affinity binding sites to each low affinity binding site. Because of the rapid nature of this transition, the data could not be successfully fitted to a binding model. ITC of sulphate titrated into Mop The binding of sulphate to Mop was investigated because sulphate is quite a similar oxyanion to molybdate, unlike phosphate or vanadate, which are protonated. Mop was found to weakly bind sulphate. A high concentration of sulphate resulted in a small amount of binding, which was weakly exothermic and characteristic for binding at a single site with no cooperativity (Fig.

was more endothermic. This confirmed that sulphate was bound at type 2 sites. Effect of buffer conditions on binding thermodynamics Within the pH range 7­9, the apparent binding constant of the high affinity binding site (type 2) was observed to change. Molybdate binding at this site decreased over the pH range from above 1.2 · 108 to 3.7 · 107 MÀ1. This indicates that binding at type 2 sites is weakened as a side chain in this binding pocket moves to a lower positive partial charge or that binding is linked to protonation. To determine whether the protein was protonated during binding, ITC was performed in different buffers. Different buffers have specific associated heats of ionisation, which alter the heat of binding for interactions that involve a change in ionisation. In this case, the heat of reaction measured (DHITC) is proportional to the heat of ionisation of the buffer (DHion) [20]: DH ITC ¼ DH binding þ DnDH ion At pH 7.6, the effect on type 2 sites of changing buffer was monitored for molybdate titrated into Mop (Fig. 5).

bound (Fig. 4). In the presence of sulphate, the full quotient of 8 mol molybdate was bound per Mop hexamer indicating that molybdate was able to replace all the bound sulphate. The raw data were fitted as for the titration of molybdate into apo-Mop with a non-identical non-interacting site model (Fig. 4B). Most parameters had very similar values when compared to the binding of molybdate in the absence of sulphate, however it was evident that the binding at high affinity type 2 sites

The experimental values of DHITC for type 2 sites have error bars that are from the have error bars that are for the error generated in a single experiment. Linear regression has a y-intercept (À11.2 ± 1.3 kcal/mol) equal to the ionisation independent heat of binding and a gradient (1.1 ± 0.1) equal to the number of protons transferred in the binding reaction. The gradient is positive, indicating that 1.1 protons per binding site are transferred from the buffer to the protein.

The graph of DHITC vs. DHion has an intercept equal to the ionisation independent heat of binding at type 2 sites, À11.2 ± 1.3 kcal/mol. This graph also has a gradient equal to the number of protons transferred from the buffer to the protein as a result of binding (1.1 ± 0.1 protons). Thus, 6.6 ± 0.6 protons are transferred to the Mop hexamer.

Discussion The binding of molybdate to Mop proved to be extremely well suited to a microcalorimetric investigation. The heats of reaction for Mop binding molybdate were large enough to support the use of a low protein concentration (lM). Furthermore, two sets of binding sites were observed to exist, with different affinities and heats of reaction. In Tris­Cl at pH 7.6, binding at type 1 sites was found to be exothermic, and of low affinity, while binding at type 2 sites was endothermic and of high affinity. This can be explained using the structure of ModG from A. vinelandii which should bind molybdate in much the same way as Mop does because the key residues involved in binding are conserved between these molbindins [21]. In ModG, molybdate makes more hydrogen bonds to the protein when bound in type 1 sites than type 2 sites, however none of these bonds involve positively charged residues. In type 2 sites, bonds are made from the positively charged Lys60 to the oxyanion, and this supports the finding that type 2 sites have higher affinity than type 1 sites because the attraction of the negatively charged oxyanion to the positively charged side chain may enhance binding. We also document that type 2 sites are somewhat non-specific with respect to ligands, in that sulphate was found to be a binding partner. This can also be confirmed in the

ModG crystal structure, in that most bonds between the oxyanion and the protein at type 1 sites involve the protein backbone and are hence less flexible than those in type 2 sites that mostly involve side-chain residues. Therefore binding to the more flexible type 2 side chains may allow for less discriminate binding. The ITC data presented for the titration of molybdate into Mop are internally consistent with the reverse binding experiment of Mop titrated into molybdate. From the reverse binding experiment, the total DH generated by molybdate binding simultaneously at type 1 and type 2 sites is À7 kcal/mol (Fig. 2). This value is an independent confirmation for the titration of molybdate into Mop where the heats of reaction for type 1 sites plus type 2 sites add to À6.7 kcal/mol. We were also able to confirm by ICP-MS that Mop had at least six sites that were of high enough affinity to remain occupied when the free ligand was removed. In this experiment, some molybdate that was presumably bound to lower affinity sites may have been removed along with the free ligand. Investigation of Mop binding at different pH values revealed that the binding at type 1 sites was unaffected by a change in the buffer pH. Interestingly, the binding at type 2 sites was weakened at increased pH. This could be due to hydrogen bonding to Lys60, an interaction that would weaken at higher pH as the protonation of the side-chain nitrogen would be harder to achieve. When binding was studied in buffers of different ionic concentrations, it was discovered that indeed one proton per Mop monomer was transferred from the buffer to the protein as a result of binding and that this occurred in type 2 binding sites. Together, these data strongly suggest that Lys60 is protonated in response to molybdate binding. Mop was observed to weakly bind sulphate at a single type of site. These data were well fitted assuming that sulphate bound at the six higher affinity type 2 sites. This assumption was validated when molybdate was titrated into a sulphate saturated Mop species where binding at the high affinity sites was noticeably different when compared to molybdate binding apo-Mop. As most molybdate binding residues are conserved between H. influenzae Mop and A. vinelandii ModG, it is interesting to note that the ModG structure shows that a network of hydrogen bonds between the two classes of binding sites exists through Asn22 (Fig. 6). It is suggested that this may facilitate a cooperative interaction between the two classes of binding site [21]. While the ITC data for the titration of molybdate into Mop were reasonably fitted using a non-identical non-interacting sites model, there is some deviation from the model during the initial stages of molybdate binding (Figs. 1B and 4B). This could possibly be as a result of cooperativity between the binding sites. If this were the case, molybdate binding at type 2 sites might lead

Fig. 6. The hydrogen bond network between molybdate bound at type 2 and type 1 sites in ModG from A. vinelandii [21]. Molybdate binding in type 2 sites traps a water molecule (Wat) that interacts with Asn22. This could facilitate a higher affinity binding at type 1 sites (a cooperative interaction). As type 1 sites are at the trimeric axis of symmetry, three type 2 binding sites contribute to the binding at each type 1 binding site. All the residues implicated in this scenario are conserved between A. vinelandii ModG and H. influenzae Mop.

to more exothermic heats of reaction at type 1 sites by increasing the affinity of these sites. This explanation agrees with the difference between the predicted and experimental data whereby at first the effect of type 1 sites is overestimated, and subsequently this effect is underestimated. Binding thermodynamics for another molbindin family member, Mop from C. pasteurianum, have also been determined [10]. In this Mop, the type 1 binding sites were high affinity and endothermic while type 2 sites were low affinity and exothermic. These results are the reverse of ours concerning Mop from H. influenzae with regard to both the nature of enthalpic change and the order of binding at the two types of binding sites. Amino acids involved in binding differ between these proteins and may help explain the discrepancies in these data (Fig.1B in [10]). In C. pasteurianum, type 2 sites have the hydroxylic amino acid Ser43 which is substituted for by Ala43 in H. influenzae Mop. This could result in one less hydrogen bond per H. influenzae type 2 binding site, which might lead to the observed difference in binding which is weaker at this site when compared to C. pasteurianum Mop. The second change that might affect binding is the H. influenzae Mop amino acid Asn22 that is Thr22 in C. pasteurianum Mop. Type 1 binding sites in H. influenzae Mop may therefore have a sidechain amide hydrogen bond as opposed to a side-chain hydroxyl hydrogen bond as in C. pasteurianum Mop. The involvement of the side-chain amide may result in higher affinity binding, which is the observed difference

between these proteins. Furthermore, the network of hydrogen bonds between the two classes of binding sites, which we believe exists in H. influenzae Mop through Asn22, is not visible in C. pasteurianum Mop via Thr22. Therefore, this could be a central reason the thermodynamics of C. pasteurianum Mop are so different to those of H. influenzae Mop. The intracellular control of essential transition metals such as copper and iron can help describe how Mop might function in the cell. As these free metals can be quite toxic at high concentration, they are often bound by proteins which control the intracellular metal concentration. At present, it has not been shown that Mop transports molybdate specifically to any receptors like the copper chaperone Atx1 [22]. Although molbindins such as ModG have been implicated in intracellular movement of molybdenum towards its role in the nitrogenase cofactor [2] this has yet to be documented. Mop could act as a molybdenum storage protein, such as ferritin for iron [23]. In this case, Mop would buffer the concentration of molybdate in the cell as the high affinity binding sites will bind most free molybdate at low concentrations. At higher molybdate concentrations, buffering will occur due to the low affinity Mop binding sites. Only when Mop is saturated would the regulatory protein ModE be required to act, as it has a lower affinity for molybdate of 1.3 · 106 MÀ1 [11]. Thus, Mop could regulate a homeostatic concentration of molybdate in the cell without relying on ModE for transcriptional repression which would be slower to change the concentration of molybdate in the cell. In conclusion, these studies have shown Mop to be an intriguing thermodynamic system. Mop binds molybdate at two types of site and affinities for these were established. Protonation of the protein during binding and its effect on the affinity of type 2 sites was also documented. Acknowledgments Many thanks to D. Lawson, L. Delarbre, C. Williams, and L.
