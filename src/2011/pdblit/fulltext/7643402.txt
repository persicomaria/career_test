After one cotistrained crystallographic refinement cycle, whictl reduced the crystallographic difference Fourier map reliability factor (R) from 3596 to 3196, a preliminary showed several interesting details. Several refinement cycles reduced the value of R to 23%. The overall chain folding is very similar to trypsin. The chain segments, including residues 184 to 193t alld 217 to 223, which form the specificity pocket in trypsin, are flexible in trypsinogen. The autolysis loop is partially mobile between residues 142 and 152. There is IIO continuing electron densit>for the N terminal residues preceding Tyr20. This indicates that, t)he N terminals may be only weakly fixed to t,he rest of the mok~cllle or may even float freely in sotllt,ion.

1. Introduction
Like the other serine proteases, bovine trypsin is produced in the acinar cells of the pancreatic tissue as the proenzyme trypsinogen. which displays only very weak intrinsic activity toward certain substrates (Kay & Kassell. 1971; Morgan et al., 1972; Kerr et al., 1975). After its secretion into the intestine, the zymogen is transformed into the highly active trypsin species catalysed by enterokinase (Kunitz, 1939) or by trypsin itself (Kay & Kassell, 1971). Th is activation involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Lysl5 and IlelGt, close to the N terminus (Davie & Neurath. 1955; Desunelle & Fabre, 1955), the release of t'he split-off hexapeptide and the appearance of a new, positively charged u-amino group on Ile16. This free end intrudes into the core of the molecule to form the IIelGAsp194 salt bridge (Oppenheimer et al., 1966) which is a common feature of t)he crystal structures of the homologous mammalian serine proteases a-chymotrypsin (Matthews et al., 1967), elastase (Shotton & Watson, 1970) and bovine trypsin (Huber et al., 1974; Stroud et al., 1974:

Bode & Schwager 1975). From a, variety of modification experiments it may be concluded that the formation of t,hin ion pair is a prerequisite for specific enzymatic activity (see e.g. Robinson et al., 1973). Evidently the activation must be paralleled by large conformational changes, which has also been indicated by optical observations (PechBre & Neurath, 1957). of the three-dimensional structures of the active enzymes Due to the close similarity chymotrgpsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972) and trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975), it may be expected that trypsinogen may also be closely related structurally to chymotrypsinogen A, which has been determined to 2.5 ,& resolution by X-ray crystal structure analysis (Freer et nl., 1970). Likewise the chain rearrangements that occur upon activation of trypsinogen may be similar to those during the transition of chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin that have been carefully analysed recently of (Wright, 1973aJ). However, in some respects the struct'ure and conformation t,rypsinogen must be different from those of the other zymogens: especially at the splitting site. This is shown for example by its unique activation peptide containing four aspartate residues besides Val and Lys (Walsh & Neurath. 1964), the requirement for calcium ions for specific cleavage (Abita et al.. 1969; Radhakrishnan et al., 1969) and its highly specific suscept,it)ility t'o enberokinase. Presumably these unique struct'ural and activation propert,ies enable trypsinogen t'o play its central role in the Rctivation of the other pancreatic zvmogens. Previously we have succeeded in locating the trypsin molecules within bovine trypsin crystals (Fehlhammer & Bode, 1975) by applying Patterson search techniques and by using the highly refined model co-ordinates of the bovine trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex (Huber rt (~1.: 1974). Given the highly accurate atomic co-ordinates obtained after cr(ystallographic refinement of the bovine trypsin structure at 1.8 A resolution (Bode & Schwager, 1975), a direct determination of the trypsinogen molecule seemed to be promising. Bovine trypsinogen crystallizes in trigonal crystals isomorphous with a modified bovine trypsin crystal obtained under special conditions (Stroud et al.. 1974). This indicates that. in spite of some very characteristic local differences, the overall structures of both the t'rypsinogen and the activated enzyme should be similar, t'hus facilitating the Patterson search. Tn this paper we report the collection of 1.8 .A resolution data on native trypsinogen crystals and the successful finding of the orientation and localization of the txypsinogen molecules within their crystal cell by fit'ting the molecule Patterson function to the crystal. A difference Fourier map calculated after one constrained crystallographic refinement cycle (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975) clearly proved the accuracy of the localization, and showed those pa&s of the trypsinogen molecule being delocalized with respect to the t,rypsin. Several rounds of constrained crystallographic refinement and difference Fourier map interpretation reduced the reliability factor to 23O:,. A short structural interpretation of the trypsinogen molecule is given. In a subsequent paper w-e will describe the details of the trypsinogen molecule and t'he refinement process.

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Trypsinogen crystallization

In order to prevent autolysis, the crystallization of bovine trypsinogen (Boehringer, Mannheim) was done in the presence of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Bayer, I,everkusen), as first proposed by Kunitz $ Northrop (1936). Crystallization was achieved

using the vapour diffusion technique described for trypsin crystallization by Fehlhammer & Bode (1975). From 0.2 M-&XnmOniUIn sulfate solutions (pH 7*3), containing trypsinogen and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor at a molar ratio of 5/l and about 30% (v/v) ethanol, perfect octahedral crystals of about 0.1 mm diam., also described by Balls (1965), could be grown at 4°C. However, much larger trypsinogen crystals with the shape of short t,rigonal prisms (see Fig. 1) with 0.7 mm and 0.3 mm edges, respectively, could be grown at 20°C from 1.5 M-magnesium sulfate solutions (pH 6.9) containing trypsinogen and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor at a molar ratio of 4/l. These crystals are quite distinct from the complex crystals formed by trypsinogen and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (P. Schwager. personal communication). After washing and dissolving the crystals in 0.01 N-HCl, practically no catalytic activity toward specific ester substrates (like p-toluenesulfonyl-Larginine methyl ester) was observed. However, within a few hours of the addition of small amounts of trypsin the dissolved crystalline material attained a specific esterolytic activity, as expected for activated trypsinogen, thus proving the presence of pure nonactivated trypsinogen within the crystals. The cell Precession photographs indicated the space group P3,21 or its enantiomorph. constants were measured on a diffractometer: a = b = 55.1 A, c = 109.4 A. According to its volume per asymmetric unit of 48,000 A3, there is only 1 trypsinogen molecule/ asymmetric unit, yielding a packing density of about 2.0 A3/dalton, i.e. slightly above average protein crystal values (Matthews, 1908). (b) Uatu collection and processing The crystals were equilibrated with 2.4 M-m&qX?SiUm sulfate, adjusted with small amounts of phosphate buffer to pH 6.9. Reflexion data to 1.8 A resolution were collected with a rotation camera using 2 crystals with their a and c axes, respectively, parallel to the spindle axis. The rotation angles for each rotation photograph were 1.5" and 3.5", respectively. The refinement of the setting angles and the evaluation and processing of the data were performed using programs and procedures described by Sohwager et al. (1975). Out of approx. 64,000 processed individual measurements above the 20 significance level, about 15,000 unique reflexions corresponding to about 80% of the expected reflexions to 1.8 k resolution were obtained by a merging and scaling method described by Steigemann (1974), which determines relative scaling and temperature factors for each film data set. The absorption correction of the data performed with an analytical method described by Schwager et aE. (1973) improved the data substantially. The RF value of all merged data, defined aa

(c) Search methods
Rotational search with the model vector set of the refined trypsin molecule was done in the trypsinogen Patterson function as performed in the trypsin search (Fehlhammer & Bode, 1975), applying methods and programs described elsewhere (Huber, 1965; Fehlhammer, 1975). The search was done including data up to 2.5 b resolution, selecting 10% of the grid points of the vector set associated with the highest function values within radius limits of 5 and 30 A. The positioning of the correctly oriented molecule was done in direct space by translation function calculation (Huber, 1965; Hoppe, 1957) in a 4 A Patterson function. The positioning along the unique c axis and the refinement of the position were done by a minimization of the I? factor of the (O/cl) reflections:

(a) Localization of the molecule and discriminatio~L between.the r)Lantiomorphic space groups
The model vector set was constructed from the refined trypsin co-ordinates (Bode &I Schwager, 1975) placed with its centre of gravity in the origin, but excluding the chain segments from residues 16 to 20, 140 to 155, and 191 to 194, respectively. Their conformations were expected to be different in trypsin and trypsinogen. The rotational search was done in 10" steps for one asymmetric unit of the corresponding rotation space group (Tollin et al., 1966) about the three Eulerian angles #,0,$-i. The product function showed only one prominent peak at 4 = O", 8 = lo", q3 -= 180` with a height of 120 (see Fig. 2). The next highest peak and the mean value were 62 and 11, respectively (arbitrary units). A fine scan about the maximum in 0.1' intervals yielded the best orientation value at I# : -0.2", 8 = 14.1" and C#= 179.9". This result was confirmed by a calculation of the Fast Rotation Function of Crowther (1972) using 5 A resolution data.

Only the first one is consistent with the maximum in Figure 3(b), yielding translational components of 48.4 A and 16.7 A for x and y, respectively. An attempt was made to determine the translation component along z, using the vector set generated from molecules at equivalent positions (x,y,z) and (-y+z,--y, 2/3-z). This is located on Harker plane y,2y,1/3+2z. The failure of this search is still unclear. Therefore we determined the z parameter by shifting the molecule in 1 A steps along the z axis at x and y as obtained above and calculating the corresponding R factor of the (Okl) reflexions to 2.5 A resolution.

(b) Preliminary structural interpretatiofl

Positioned according to these best orientational and translational parameters, the refined trypsin co-ordinates (Bode & Schwager, 1975) served as the trypsinogen starting model. An overall temperature factor of 105 AZ could be deduced from a Wilson plot. Calculating the structure factors up to 1.8 A resolution and considering only the molecular segments including residues 21 to 139, 156 to 190, and 195 to 245, respectively, the R value of this starting model was 35:/,. This indicates correct positioning of the molecule. After one refinement. cycle, producing a root-meansquare shift of about 0.2 A, the R value decreased to 31%. This fast convergence of the refinement again proves the close similarity in overall folding between trypsin and its zymogen and the rather accurate spatial arrangement of most main and sidechains of our trypsinogen model at this early stage of refinement. This was also underlined by the first, difference Fourier map, which shows only small segments where obviously the trypsinogen structure deviates from trypsin. In Figure 6, a section of this difference map around residues 141 and 154 is presented, with atomic positions as observed in trypsin. Both residues terminate the external "autolysis" loop where the cleavage from /3 to cc-trypsin takes place (Schroeder & Shaw, 1968). As shown in Figure 6: residues Gly140, Trp141, Va1154 and Leul55 omitted from the F, calculation can unequivocally be seen in the map. Evidently the indole ring of Trp141 is already correctly aligned, whereas the main and side-chains of residues 154 and 155 will still have to be shifted slightly for ideal localization. It can also be seen in Figure 6 that the internal water molecule OH412 found in the trypsin crystal structure which has been omitted in the F, calculation already tits well the electron density maximum in this trypsinogen map. From an inspection of the map it can be concluded that most, of the internal water molecules found ho be integral constituents of the trypsin crystal structure, and which were omitted for the phase calculation, are present in the trypsinogen molecule at very similar positions. This also holds true for the several water molecules found in the calcium loop, but not for some which are localized in the specificity pocket. Figure 6 and the previous discussion show that reasonable structural detail emerges in a difference Fourier map though it has not been put in for phasing. Further evidence along these lines has been presented, particularly in the refinement of trypsin (Bode & Schwager, 1975) (Ca binding and benzamidinium group), the anhydro-trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex (Huber et aE., 1975) (absence of Ser195 Ov), the Bence-Jones protein Rei (Epp et al., 1975) (two cis-prolines), and carboxypeptidase B (Schmid & Herriot, 1976). In this difference map no continuing and interpretable positive electron density was observed for the major parts of the autolysis loop from residues 142 to 152: suggesting flexibility. The very specific interactions of the kind observed in chymotrypsinogen (Freer et al., 1970) appear to be absent. Interestingly. even the highly refined Fourier maps of the free (Bode & Schwager, manuscript in preparation) and of the complexed fl-trypsin (Huber et al., 1974) are somewhat diffuse at this autolysis

It may be added t'hat in the crystal structure of the complex formed by trypsinogen and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the refinement of which is now under way in our laboratory, this loop also seems to be relatively mobile, although its course can be completely followed in the corresponding Fourier map.

As was expected from the finding report'ed by Freer et al. (19X)), that the specificity pocket is only partially formed in chymotrysinogen, the chain segments surrounding this pocket are arranged in a different way in trypsinogen, as compared to active trypsin. In contrast to chymotrypsinogen, however, these chain segments are flexible in trypsinogen. There is no significant electron density in the final difference Fourier map for residues Tyr184 (the aromatic side chain has low density, around 0.3 e/A") to Gly193. The density in the area where this segment would have to be located is generally below 02 e/As. There are some density maxima of 0.3 e/A3 around, but not more than in solvent regions and by no means interpretable with a continuous peptide chain. Note that the peak heights for some fixed residues as shown in Figure 6 were 0.6 e/A3 for Trpl41, 0.7 e/A" for HZ0412 and 0.6 e/A3 for the peptide 153-154. Asp194 appears to be fixed with its carboxylate group close to t,he imidazole of His40 group as in chymotrypsinogen (Freer et al., 1970; Wright, 1973a,h). The carboxylate lies in a density of 0.7 e/As. Also, the segment Ser217 to Asn223 is flexible. The main chain of Lys222 and Asn223 is in a density of around 0.2 e/A". It, is remarkable that the disulfide bridge Cyslgl-220 is also flexible. An interesting result is the fact that the N terminus of the crystalline trypsinogen is spatially fixed only from Tyr20 onward. Gly19 lies in a density of about 0.3 e/A3 : the density is not continuous for the preceding residues. This allows the interpretation residues 10 to 18 to the rest of the molecule is that the fixation of the N-terminal relatively weak. This would agree with similar assumptions made by Abita et al. (1969), who have carefully studied the tryptic activation of trypsinogen in solution and compared it with kinetic experiments on the tryptic cleavage of synthetic peptides sequentially related to the trypsinogen N-terminal sequence. Their concept t,hat the N-terminal chain floats freely in solution is supported by the very similar kinetic behaviour and calcium response of trypsinogen and these peptides, and by the normal behaviour and apparently free accessibility of the four aspartate residues 11 to 14. Radhakrishnan et aE. (1969) had already demonstrated the weak interaction of these aspartate carboxylate groups with the rest of the molecule and the inferior importance of these side chains for the stability of trypsinogen. As was also shown by Abita et al. (1969), the LyslS-Ilel6 bond is an exceptionally poor substrat'e for trypsin, mostly due to the presence of these charged carboxylate side-chains in its vicinity. Calcium ions may partially neutralize these charges, thus decrea.sing the K, values. It is difficult if not impossible to decide between thermal and statistical disorder in the segments discussed. If it is statistical disorder, the occupation factor of a particular conformation should be below about l/3 according to signiticance considerations of the electron density. It is interesting to note that live of the seven sites where the trypsinogen chain becomes flexible contain glycines : Gly19-Tyr20; Trp141-Gly142; Gly184-Tyrt84A; Gly193-Asp194; Gly216-Ser217. Apart from the large rearrangements discussed, there are some small alterations in trypsinogen compared to trypsin, which will be described in detail in a following paper. The general structural concept of zymogen activation which emerges from above discussion is that of a fixation of loose parts to form the specificity pocket.
