The Structural Basis of Ribosome Activity in Peptide Bond Synthesis
Poul Nissen,1* Jeffrey Hansen,1* Nenad Ban,1* Peter B. Moore,1,2 Thomas A. Steitz1,2,3
Using the atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with two substrate analogs, we establish that the ribosome is a ribozyme and address the catalytic properties of its all-RNA active site. Both substrate analogs are contacted exclusively by conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residues from domain V of 23S rRNA; there are no protein side-chain atoms closer than about 18 angstroms to the peptide bond being synthesized. The mechanism of peptide bond synthesis appears to resemble the reverse of the acylation step in serine proteases, with the base of A2486 (A2451 in Escherichia coli) playing the same general base role as histidine-57 in chymotrypsin. The unusual pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant) required for A2486 to perform this function may derive in part from its hydrogen bonding to G2482 (G2447 in E. coli), which also interacts with a buried phosphate that could stabilize unusual tautomers of these two bases. The polypeptide exit tunnel is largely formed by RNA but has significant contributions from proteins L4, L22, and L39e, and its exit is encircled by proteins L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e. It has been known for 35 years that the peptidyl transferase activity responsible for the peptide bond formation that occurs during messenger RNA (mRNA)­ directed protein synthesis is intrinsic to the large ribosomal subunit (1­4 ), and it has been understood for even longer that the ribosome contains proteins as well as RNA. In bacteria, for example, the large ribosomal subunit contains 35 different proteins and two RNAs (5, 6). These findings pose three related questions: (i) which of the macromolecular components of the large ribosomal subunit contribute to its peptidyl transferase site, (ii) where is that site located, and (iii) how does it work? By 1980, the list of components that might be part of the ribosome's peptidyl transferase center had been reduced to about a half dozen proteins and 23S rRNA [for reviews, see (7, 8)]. Following the discovery of catalytic RNAs (9, 10), the hypothesis that 23S rRNA might be its sole constituent, which had been proposed years earlier (11), began to gain favor. In 1984, Noller and colleagues published affinity-labeling results that showed that U2619 and U2620

(U2584 and U2585, respectively, in E. coli; hereafter, bases in parenthesis indicate the corresponding position in E. coli rRNA) are adjacent to the CCA-end of P site­ bound transfer RNA (tRNA) (12, 13). These nucleotides are part of a highly conserved internal loop in the center of domain V of 23S rRNA. The hypothesis that this loop is intimately involved in the peptidyl transferase activity was supported by the observation that mutations in that loop render cells resistant to many inhibitors of peptidyl transferase, and evidence implicating it in this activity has continued to mount (14, 15). Definitive proof that the central loop in domain V is the sole component of the ribosome involved in the peptidyl tranferase activity has remained elusive, however. In the 1990s, Noller and colleagues prepared particles that retain peptidyl transferase activity by increasingly vigorous deproteinizations of large ribosomal subunits, but active particles that were completely protein-free could not be produced (16, 17). Nevertheless, combined with earlier reconstitution results (18), this work reduced the number of proteins that might be involved to just two: L2 and L3 (19). More recently, Watanabe and co-workers reported success in eliciting peptidyl transferase activity from in vitro­ synthesized, protein-free 23S rRNA (20, 21), but their observations have not withstood further scrutiny (22). Thus, the question still re-

mains: is the ribosome a ribozyme or is it not? Over the years, the location of the peptidyl transferase site in the ribosome has been approached almost exclusively by electron microscopy. In the mid-1980s, evidence began to accumulate that there is a tunnel running through the large ribosomal subunit from the middle of its subunit interface side to its back (23, 24), and there was, and still is, strong reason to believe that polypeptides pass through it as they are synthesized (25­27). More recent cryo-electron microscopic investigations (28­ 31) have confirmed the existence of the tunnel and have demonstrated that the CCA ends of ribosome-bound tRNAs bound to the A (aminoacyl)- and P ( peptidyl)-sites are found in the subunit interface end of the tunnel. Consequently, the peptidyl transferase site must be located at that same position, which is at the bottom of a deep cleft in the center of the subunit interface surface of the large subunit, immediately below its central protuberance. The substrates of the reaction catalyzed by the large subunit are an aminoacyl-tRNA (aatRNA) and a peptidyl-tRNA. The former binds in the ribosome's A-site and the latter in its P-site. The -amino group of the aatRNA attacks the carbon of the carbonyl acylating the 3 hydroxyl group of the peptidyltRNA, and a tetrahedral intermediate is formed at the carbonyl carbon (Fig. 1). The tetrahedral intermediate resolves to yield a peptide extended by one amino acid esterified to the A site­ bound tRNA and a deacylated tRNA in the P-site. This reaction scheme is supported by the observations of Yarus and colleagues (32) who synthesized an analog of the tetrahedral intermediate by joining an oligonucleotide having the sequence CCdA to puromycin via a phosphoramide group (Fig. 1). The sequence CCA, which is the 3 -terminal sequence of all tRNAs, binds to the large subunit by itself, consistent with the biochemical data showing that the interactions between tRNAs and the large subunit largely depend on their CCA sequences (33, 34). Puromycin is an aa-tRNA analog that interacts with the ribosomal A-site, and the phosphoramide group of the Yarus compound mimics the tetrahedral carbon intermediate. This analog, CCdA-phosphate-puromycin (CCdA-pPuro), binds tightly to the ribosome, and inhibits its peptidyl transferase activity (32). Although the structure of the large ribosomal subunit has now been determined at atomic resolution (35), experience with other enzymes shows that this information alone is usually insufficient for discovering catalytic mechanism. That level of understanding is achieved only when the structure of the enzyme complexed with substrates and substrate analogs has been determined. Accordingly, we have made crystals of Haloarcula marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit complexed either with the Yarus analog, CCdA-p-Puro, or with a mini-helix analog of an aa-tRNA and have determined the structures of both complexes. The CCdA from the Yarus analog binds to the so-called P-loop (36), and hence is in the P-site. Only the terminal CCA of the aa-tRNA analog is visible, but because it interacts appropriately with the A-loop (37), it must be in the A-site. The puromycin group occupies the same location in both structures, and there are no proteins near that site. Hence, the catalytic activity of the active site must depend entirely on RNA. The N3 of A2486 (A2451) is the titratable group nearest to the peptide bond being synthesized and is likely functioning as a general base to facilitate the nucleophilic attack by the -amino group of the A-site substrate. In order to function in this capacity, the pKa of this base has to be roughly 5 units higher than normal. It is possible that its unusual pKa may be produced by an interaction between A2486 (A2451) and G2482 (G2447), which in turn hydrogen bonds with the buried phosphate of A2485 (A2450). This buried phosphate can stabilize normally rare imino tautomeric forms of both bases, resulting in a "charge relay" that increases the negative charge density on the N3. When A-, P-, and E-site tRNAs are docked onto the two bound CCAs, they appear to contact proteins L10e, L5, and L44e on the central protuberance as well as 23S rRNA. The tunnel through which the polypeptide product passes is lined largely with RNA, but it includes a 12 Å constriction formed by portions of L4 and L22. Structures of substrate analog complexes. In order to establish how substrates interact at the A- and P-sites of the large subunit, two substrate analogs were used. One of the analogs, which was designed to mimic the acceptor stem of an aa-tRNA and bind to the A-site, was a 12­ base pair RNA hairpin with an aminoacylated, four-nucleotide extension on its 3 end (Fig. 1). The sequence used was that of the tRNAtyr acceptor stem, and it is terminated with puromycin, which itself is an analog of tyrosylA76. The second analog used was the Yarus tetrahedral intermediate analog, CCdA-p-Puro. As in the case of the A-site substrate analog, the puromycin of the Yarus inhibitor is expected to bind at the A-site, whereas its CCdA moiety should bind at the P-site. The positions of the Yarus inhibitor and the tRNA acceptor stem analog were determined by soaking these molecules into crystals of the Haloarcula marismortui 50S ribosomal subunit, measuring diffraction data to 3.2 Å resolution and calculating difference electron density maps (38). Maps of the complexes were also calculated using 2Fo(complexed) ­ Fo(uncomplexed) as coefficients, to examine the shifts in the positions of ribosome residues that occur when these analogs bind (Fig. 2B and Table 1). A model for the entire Yarus inhibitor could be fitted into the difference density (Fig. 2A), and the electron density map of the complex shows the N3 of A2486 (A2451) within hydrogen bonding distance of a nonbridging oxygen of the phosphoramide (Fig. 2B). The inhibitor's two C residues, which correspond to C74 and C75 of peptidyl-tRNA, are Watson-Crick basepaired with G2285 (G2252) and G2284 (G2251) in the P-loop, respectively (Fig. 3A). The C74-G2285 (G2252) interaction was pre-

dicted by the results of Noller and co-workers (39). The dA, which corresponds to A76 of a tRNA in the P-site, is not base-paired, but rather stacks on the ribose of A2486 and hydrogen bonds to the 2 OH of nucleotide A2485 (A2450) (Fig. 3B). Only the CC-puromycin moiety of the minihelix acceptor stem analog showed ordered electron density in its difference electron density map (Fig. 2C). The C75 of the acceptor stem CCA is Watson-Crick base-paired with G2588 (G2553) of the A-loop, whereas the C74 is more disordered and is not base-paired but appears to stack on a ribosome base. This interaction between C75 and G2588 is consistent with the results of Green and co-workers (40), who first demonstrated the functional proximity of the A-loop to the CCA end of A site­ bound tRNA and who introduced the terms A-loop and P-loop. The dimethyl A of the A-site inhibitor puromycin is positioned identically to the dimethyl A of the Yarus inhibitor. Further, the dimethyl A of puromycin, which is the A76 equivalent of an A-site tRNA, interacts with the A-loop in much the same way that the A76 from the P-site CCA interacts with the P-loop (Fig. 3B). The CCAs bound in the A- and P-sites are related by a twofold axis. The most notable of the several conformational changes in the ribosome induced by the binding of the tetrahedral intermediate analog is the ordering of base A2637 (A2602), which is disordered in the unliganded enzyme (Fig. 3B). It becomes positioned between the CCA bound at the A-site and the CCA bound at the P-site. The base of U2620 (U2585) also moves so that it can make a hydrogen bond with the 2 hydroxyl of the ribose of A76 in the A-site, and U2619 (U2584) and G2618 (G2583) shift to allow that placement of A76. Smaller shifts are observed in the positions of A2486 (A2451), whose N3 is near to the nonbridging oxygen of the phosphate, and one of the G residues with which it interacts, G2102 (G2482). Location and chemical composition of the peptidyl transferase site. The inhibitors are bound to a site made entirely of 23S rRNA with no proteins nearby, proving that the ribosome is a ribozyme. Both the Yarus inhibitor and the A-site analog of aa-tRNA bind to the large subunit at the bottom of a large and deep cleft at the entrance to the 100-Å-long polypeptide exit tunnel that runs through to the back of the subunit (Fig. 4). This site is surrounded by nucleotides belonging to the central loop of 23S rRNA domain V, the "peptidyl transferase loop." Nucleotides from the single-stranded portions of this loop make the closest approach

to the phosphate that mimics the tetrahedral carbon intermediate. In general, the helices that extend from the peptidyl transferase loop in secondary structure diagrams of 23S rRNA also extend away from the active site in the tertiary structure (Fig. 5). Although there are 15 proteins that interact with domain V (Fig. 6A), there are no globular proteins in the vicinity of the inhibitor. The closest polypeptides are the nonglobular extensions of several proteins (L2, L3, L4, L10e) that penetrate deeply into domain V and approach the active site (Fig. 6B). These extensions fill many of the voids between the RNA helices of domain V, neutralize phosphate backbone charge, and presumably stabilize the structure of the domain and its association with other RNA regions. However, none of their side-chain atoms is closer than about 18 Å to the phosphorus of the inhibitor's phosphate group, which marks the site where peptide bonds form. Furthermore, both substrate analogs are completely enclosed in an rRNA cavity that is so tightly packed that there is no possibility that an unidentified peptide could be lurking nearby (Fig. 7). Thus, the catalytic entity in the ribosome must be RNA. Two of the proteins with long termini or loops penetrating the rRNA scaffold of domain V are proteins that could not previously be excluded from involvement in the peptidyl transferase reaction, L2 and L3 (19).

colleagues (16) found that under conditions that prevent RNA denaturation, extensive digestion of Thermus thermophilus 50S subunits with proteases followed by extraction with phenol and other agents that disrupt protein-RNA interactions did not remove several peptides from the subunit that were less than 10,000 in molecular weight. The structure makes it clear why these protein fragments were particularly resistant to protease treatments. Although protease treatment could digest the globular protein domains on the surface of the large subunit, it could not remove the long termini or loops that penetrate deeply in the 23S rRNA because they are sequestered within the rRNA and thus protected from cleavage. Peptidyl transferase active site. The RNA that surrounds the substrate analogs is closely packed, much like the active site region of a protein enzyme, and the nucleotides in contact with the inhibitor are 95% conserved in all three kingdoms of life (Fig. 7). Thus, it is clear that the ribosome is a ribozyme, but what gives the RNA its catalytic power? The residue most likely to be involved in catalysis, presumably as a general base in the first step, is A2486 (A2451), whose N3 is about 3 Å from the phosphoramide oxygen of the Yarus inhibitor that is the analog of the carbonyl oxygen of a nascent peptide bond and about 4 Å from the amide that corresponds to the amide nitrogen of the peptide bond being synthesized. Because there is no other titratable RNA functional group closer than 5 Å to the nascent peptide bond, there is no other group available to function as a general base. Ordinarily, the pKa of the N1 of adenosine monophosphate is about 3.5 and that of its N3 is perhaps 2 pH units lower (41), and in order for A2486 to function as a general base, its pKa would have to be raised to 7 or higher. The crystal structure itself suggests that its pKa is, in fact, quite unusual. The N3 of A2486 can only hydrogen bond to the phosphate oxygen, as observed, if it (or, less likely, the phosphate oxygen) is protonated. The distance between these two atoms is about 3 Å, indicating that a hydrogen bond does, indeed, exist between them. Because the crystal is at pH 5.8, this implies that the pKa of the N3 is 6. Muth et al. have measured the pKa of the corresponding A in E. coli 23S RNA by examining its dimethyl sulfate reactivity as a function of pH and have concluded that it is 7.6, although they cannot be sure from their experiments whether it is the N3 or N1 whose pKa they have measured (42). Although A2486 is protonated in our crystals at pH 5.8, at physiological pH, a significant fraction will be in the unprotonated form that can function as a general base. There are several features of the environment of A2486 (A2451) that might affect its pKa. It may be increased significantly in part by a charge relay mechanism, analogous to that which occurs in the active site of the serine proteases (43), with the buried phosphate of A2485 (A2450) performing a similar function as the buried carboxylate of Asp102 of chymotrypsin. The experimental 2.4 Å electron density map of the unliganded subunit (35) unambiguously establishes the many hydrogen bonding interactions in this critical region of the active site (Fig. 8A). The N6 of A2486 interacts with the O6 atoms of G2482 (G2447) and G2102 (G2061) (Fig. 8B). The N2 of G2482

also interacts with a nonbridging oxygen of the phosphate group of A2485 (A2450) that is among the three most solvent-inaccessible phosphate groups (826, 1497, and 2485) in the large ribosomal subunit, none of which appear to have a neutralizing counterion in the 2.4 Å resolution map. There is weak electron density that may correspond to a water molecule hydrogen bonded to the other nonbridging oxygen. The buried phosphate of A2485 could be acting electrostatically through a low-dielectric medium to affect the pKa of A2486. Alternatively, it could abstract the proton from the exocyclic N2 of G2482 in order to neutralize its energetically unfavorable buried negative charge. This, in turn, would stabilize the otherwise rare imino tautomer of that base. The interaction of the amino tautomer of G2482 with A2486 could likewise stabilize the imino tautomer of A2486 that would result in a negative charge on its N3 were it unprotonated (Fig. 8C). In this way, some of the negative electrostatic charge originating on the buried phosphate of A2485 could be relayed to the N3 of A2486, thereby increasing its pKa. The A2486 (A2451) and G2102 (G2061) are completely conserved in ribosomes from all three kingdoms. Although G2482 (G2447) is 98% conserved, it is not 100% conserved. It is an A in three archaea 23S rRNA sequences and deleted in some eubacteria sequences (44). It is not possible, however, to simply replace the base of G2482 by that of an adenine and maintain the same structure

Residues G2102 (G2061) and G2482 (G2447) are hydrogen bonded to the N6 of A2486 (A2451) and G2482, which interacts with a neighboring phosphate group of A2485 (A2450).

Fig. 9. A proposed mechanism of peptide synthesis catalyzed by the ribosome. A2486 (A2451) is shown as the standard tautomer in all steps, but could be represented as the imino tautomer, which would have a negative unprotonated N3 and a neutral protonated N3. We expect that the electronic distribution is actually between these two extremes. (A) The N3 of A2486 abstracts a proton from the NH2 group as the latter attacks the carbonyl carbon of the peptidyl-tRNA. (B) A protonated N3 stabilizes the tetrahedral carbon intermediate by hydrogen bonding to the oxyanion. (C) The proton is transferred from the N3 to the peptidyl tRNA 3 OH as the newly formed peptide deacylates. Among the variations on this mechanism that should be considered would be a protonated A2486 stabilizing the intermediate, as in (B), with less contribution on acid-base catalysis, as shown in (A) and (C).

abstracts a proton from the -amino group of the A-site­bound aa-tRNA, facilitating the nucleophilic attack of this amino group on the carbonyl carbon that acylates the 3 OH of the tRNA in the P-site (Fig. 9A). In contrast to the serine proteases, however, the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate is near to the protonated N3 of A2486 (A2451) rather than being proximal to a separate oxyanion binding site. Thus, it could be that the protonated N3 of A2486 stabilizes the formation of the oxyanion by hydrogen bonding to it (Fig. 9B), as we observe in the Yarus inhibitor complex. The N3 of A2486 could then subsequently transfer its proton to the 3 hydroxyl of the P site­ bound tRNA, which is liberated as the peptide shifts to the A site­ bound tRNA (Fig. 9C). How is the catalyzed hydrolysis of the peptidyl tRNA in the P-site prevented prior to the delivery of the next appropriate aa-tRNA to the A-site? It appears from this complex that water would not be excluded from access to the peptidyl link to the P-site tRNA if the A-site were vacant. An analogous problem was discussed by Koshland in the 1960s (49): he asked why hexokinase does not hydrolyze ATP in the absence of glucose, because water should bind perfectly well to the binding site used by the 6-hydroxyl of glucose. The answer he proposed was induced fit; hexokinase is not catalytically competent until glucose binds and produces a conformational change that orients substrates and catalytic groups optimally. This is indeed the case (50). Similarly, it could be either that the catalytic A2486 and/or the peptidyl substrate are not properly oriented or that the binding site for the NH2 group is blocked by a reoriented ribosome base in the absence of aatRNA in the A-site. We observe that the base of U2620 is close to A2486 in the ligand free structure, and it may serve as the plug that prevents spontaneous hydrolysis of peptidyltRNA. The structure of an analog of peptidyltRNA bound to the P-site of the large ribosomal subunit will have to be determined in order to answer this question. Thus, it appears that this RNA enzyme uses the same principles of catalysis as a protein enzyme. First, a large catalytic enhancement is achieved by precisely orienting the two reactants, the NH2 from the A-site aa-tRNA and the carbonyl carbon from the P-site peptidyl-

of the active site residues shown in Fig. 8. We expect that the positioning as well as the chemical characteristics of A2486 (A2451) must remain similar in all ribosomes. Two possible explanations for this lack of complete conservation are apparent. One possibility is sequencing errors or misalignments of sequences. Alternatively, ribosomes containing a base other than G2482 (G2447) may show additional sequence covariances that would allow G2482 to be replaced by an A in such a manner that the A could make the same kinds of hydrogen bonding interactions and tautomeric shifts as the G does. A second feature of the environment of the catalytic site that may affect its stability, tautomeric state, and electrostatic charge distribution is a bound monovalent cation. A potassium ion interacts with the O6 and N7 atoms of G2482 and G2102 as well as with another bases. Its identity as a potassium ion is established by its coordination and by an independent experiment showing that a rubidium ion can bind to this site. The monovalent ion might also stabilize nonstandard tautomers, but the influence it might exert on the pKa of A2486 is less obvious. Early biochemical experiments have shown the importance of potassium for peptidyl transferase activity (3, 4 ), and this binding site could be responsible for that effect. It may also be the case that stabilization of

an imino tautomer by a buried phosphate explains the expected higher pKa of a catalytic cytosine in the active site of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (45­ 47). In this case, a backbone phosphate, whose solvent accessibility is similar to that of A2485 (A2450) in the ribosome, is observed to hydrogen bond to the N4 of C, and the protonated form of the imino tautomer of that C would neutralize the phosphate, promoting the function of its N3 as a general acid (46, 47). Catalytic mechanism of peptide bond formation. The proximity of the N3 of A2486 (A2451) to the peptide bond being synthesized and the nature of the reaction catalyzed suggest a chemical mechanism of peptide synthesis that is analogous to the reverse of the acylation step seen in serine proteases during peptide hydrolysis (43, 48). In that mechanism, the basic form of His57 abstracts a proton from the -amino group of the peptide hydrolysis product as it attacks the acyl-Ser195. Formation of the tetrahedral carbonyl carbon intermediate is stabilized by interaction of the oxyanion formed with backbone amides (the "oxyanion hole"). Finally, His57 transfers the proton acquired from the NH2 to Ser195 as the tetrahedral intermediate breaks down. We suggest that A2486 (A2451) is the analog of His57 in chymotrypsin and that the peptidyl-tRNA is analogous to acyl-Ser195. Thus, the N3 of A2486, with its greatly elevated pKa,

tRNA. This is accomplished, in part, by the interactions of the CCA ends of the A- and P-site tRNAs with the A- and P-loop, respectively. Secondly, acid-base catalysis and transition state stabilization are achieved by an enzyme functional group [A2486 (A2451) in this case] whose chemical properties are altered appropriately by the active site environment. Third, similar chemical principles may be used by RNA and protein enzymes to alter the pKa values of functional groups. A buried carboxylate of Asp102 acting through His57 alters the nucleophilicity of Ser195 in chymotrypsin (43). In the ribosome, a solvent inaccessible phosphate may likewise act through G2482 (G2447) to alter the nucleophilicity of the N3 of A2486 (A2451). It appears that RNA molecules "learned" how to use the chemical principles of catalysis significantly before protein molecules did. tRNA binding. Although it is not possible experimentally to bind tRNA molecules to either the A- or P-sites in these crystals for steric reasons, it is possible by model building to place the A-, P-, and E-site tRNA molecules on the large ribosomal subunit in the same relative orientation that Cate et al. observed in their 7.8 Å resolution crystallographic study of the Thermus aquaticus 70S ribosome (51). The coordinates of the three tRNA molecules in the relative positions seen in the 70S ribosome can be docked on the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit in a way that avoids steric clashes and places the acceptor stems of the Aand P-site tRNAs near the positions of the CCAs we have observed bound to the A- and P-loops (Fig. 10). Although Cate et al. (51) modeled nucleotides C74 and C75 of the P-site tRNA in a different conformation than that observed here, the C74 residues from the CCAs in both the A- and P-sites can be connected to residue 72 of the docked A- and P-site tRNAs through a modeled residue 73, and it appears that the tRNA molecules fit well onto the surface of the subunit. Unexpectedly, this modeling places the E site­, P site­, and A site­ bound

tRNA molecules in close proximity to three ribosomal proteins (Fig. 10). Proteins L5 and L10e are near tRNAs in the P- and A-sites, respectively. Because both of these proteins also interact with 5S rRNA, this observation raises the possibility that 5S rRNA and some of its associated proteins might help stabilize the positioning of ribosome-bound tRNAs and is consistent with the fact that 5S rRNA enhances ribosomal activity, but is not absolutely essential for it (52). The most extensive protein interaction appears to be between L44e and the E-site tRNA and may contribute to E-site activity. This docking model suggests that the A-site tRNA interacts with the highly conserved stem-loop 2502­2518 (2467­2483). This loop together with L10e forms a large concave surface that contacts the tRNA on the T-stem, utilizing the exact same binding site exploited by EF-Tu (53). Examination of the relationships between the CCAs bound in the A- and P-sites and the tRNAs to which they are connected, as well as their interactions with the ribosome, also leads to some insights into translocation. Immediately after formation of the new peptide bond and deacylation of the P-site tRNA, the acceptor end of the P-site tRNA is known to move to the E-side and that of the A-site tRNA moves to the P-site (54). The approximate modeling of the three tRNA molecules on the large subunit suggests some possible contributions to this process. First, there are two base-pairs between the P-site tRNA and the P-loop and only one between the A-site and the A-loop. Moving from the A- to the P-site increases base-pairing, though there must be a concomitant attraction of the deacylated P-site tRNA to an E-site. Further, the CCAs bound to the A and P loops are related by 180° rotation (Figs. 3B and 5A), whereas the tRNAs to which they are attached are not. Thus, the relationships between these CCAs and the acceptor stems to which they are attached cannot be the same in both sites and may not be equally stable. If the conformation of the A-site tRNA is less stable, then moving a

tRNA from the A- to the P-site would be energetically favored. Polypeptide exit tunnel. It appears very likely from the structure that all nascent polypeptides pass through the exit tunnel before emerging from the ribosome, because there appears to be no other way out. We are now able to address two important questions about the functioning of the polypeptide exit tunnel: (i) Why do nascent proteins not stick to its walls? Teflon has the marvelous property of not sticking to denatured egg proteins, so how has the ribosome achieved a similar nonstick surface for the denatured proteins that must pass through the tunnel? (ii) Do proteins fold to any degree in the tunnel, giving the ribosome a chaperon-like function? The length of the tunnel from the site of peptide synthesis to its exit is about 100 Å, broadly consistent with the length of nascent polypeptide that is protected from proteolytic cleavage by the ribosome (55), and the minimum length required for antibody recognition at the exit (56). The tunnel is largely straight, except for a bend 20 to 35 Å from the peptidyl transferase center (Fig. 11). Its diameter varies from about 20 Å at its widest to a narrow point of about 10 Å at the very beginning and again at a position 28 Å from the tunnel exit. The average diameter is about 15 Å. Because the smallest orifice through which the polypeptide product must pass only barely accommodates the diameter of an -helix, it seems unlikely that significant protein folding could occur within the ribosome beyond the formation of -helix. The majority of the tunnel surface is formed by domains I through V of 23S rRNA, but significant contributions are also made by the nonglobular regions of proteins L4, L22, and L39e, which not only fill some of the voids in the RNA scaffold, but also form significant portions of the tunnel wall (Fig. 11). The largest protein contributor to the surface of the tunnel is L22, whose long -hairpin loop lies between RNA segments of domains I through IV and is approximately parallel with the axis of the tunnel. Unlike the other tunnel proteins, protein L39e does not have a globular domain at the surface of the particle and is almost entirely buried in domains I and III underneath protein L23. Interestingly, the nucleotides of 23S rRNA that form the tunnel wall are predominantly from loops in the 23S rRNA secondary structure (Fig. 11). As it progresses through the tunnel from the active site, a nascent polypeptide first encounters domain V, followed 20 Å further along by domains II and IV and proteins L4 and L22. The last half of the tunnel is formed by domains I and III and the protein L39e. The narrowest part of the tunnel is formed by proteins L22 and L4, which approach the tunnel from opposite sides, forming what appears to be a gated opening (Fig. 11C). The function of this constriction, if any, is not ob-

vious. It might be the place where the nature of the nascent chain is sensed, and that information is then transmitted to the surface of the particle, perhaps through L22 or L4. The -hairpin of L22 at the site of this orifice and the 23S rRNA interacting with it are highly conserved; its globular portion is located adjacent to the tunnel exit on the surface that must face the translocon during protein secretion (Fig. 11). The "nonstick" character of the tunnel wall must reflect a lack of structural and polarity complementarity to any protein sequence or conformation that it encounters. The tunnel surface is largely hydrophilic and includes exposed hydrogen bonding groups from bases, backbone phosphates, and polar protein side chains (Fig. 11). Although there are many hydrophobic groups (sugars, bases, protein side chains) facing the tunnel as well, there are no patches of hydrophobic surface large enough to form a significant binding site for hydrophobic sequences in the nascent polypeptide. Because the tunnel is some 15 Å in diameter and filled with water and the newly synthesized polypeptide is presumably freely mobile, the binding of a peptide to the tunnel wall would result in a large loss of entropy that would have to be compensated for by a large complementary interaction surface that is larger than 700 Å (57). Similarly, while Arg and Lys side chains from a nascent peptide may indeed interact with the phosphates exposed in the tunnel, the degree of structural complementarity and the net binding energy obtained after displacing bound counterions must be too small to overcome the large unfavorable entropy of immobilization that would result from peptide binding. Thus, although the ribosome tunnel is made primarily of RNA, the nature of its surface is reminiscent of the interior surface of the chaperonin, GroEl (58) in its nonbinding conformation. Only in the conformation that exposes a large hydrophobic surface does GroEL bind denatured protein. There are six proteins (L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e) located at the exit from the tunnel, facing the translocon onto which the ribosome docks during protein secretion. Although there is good evidence that the ribosome binds to the translocon even after extensive digestion of its protein by protease, implying that interaction between the translocon and the ribosome is mediated by RNA (59), the proximity of these proteins to the translocon leads us to wonder what role, if any, they might play in the protein secretion process. Recent data from the Dobberstein laboratory shows that the NH2terminal domain of SRP54, the G protein from the signal recognition particle involved in signal peptide binding, can be crosslinked to ribosomal proteins L23 and L29 (60). These two proteins are adjacent to each other and at the tunnel exit (Fig. 11). Evolution. In vitro evolution of RNA oligonucleotides has produced small RNA molecules that can bind molecules like the Yarus inhibitor effectively or catalyze the peptidyl transfer reaction (61, 62). The sequence and secondary structure of one of these selected RNAs is reminiscent of the peptidyl tranferase loop in domain V of 23S rRNA (61). The most striking similarity is a five-nucleotide sequence that is identical to a sequence in domain V that includes the catalytic A2486, G2482, and the buried phosphate of A2485. Remarkably, all of the groups involved in the proposed charge relay system for activating A2486 in the ribosome are present in the in vitro­selected ribozyme. Thus, although the surrounding structural context is likely to be different, it seems plausible that this artificially evolved ribozyme uses the same mechanisms as the ribosome for shifting the pKa of an adenine and likewise uses it as a base for peptide synthesis. The second RNA (62), which binds the Yarus inhibitor, contains a 12-nucleotide loop that includes a nine-base sequence identical to that found in the A2486 region of the peptidyl transferase loop. The striking similarities between the sequences containing the key catalytic elements found in the peptidyl-transferase active site of the ribosome and the sequences of in vitro­ selected RNAs having related activities make it clear that the appearance of a small RNA domain capable of catalyzing peptidyl transferase was a plausible first step in the evolution of protein synthesis on the ribosome. The first peptides synthesized by this primordial peptide synthesizing enzyme might have been random polymers or copolymers, and it may have functioned with substrates as simple as an aminoacylated CCA. Basic peptides of the types observed to form the nonglobular extensions that co-fold with the 23S rRNA might have been among the first peptides synthesized that were functionally useful. Such peptides could have enhanced the stability of the protoribosome and other early ribozymes as the more sophisticated peptides of the present-day ribosome appear to do. The evolution of this simple peptide-synthesizing domain into a ribonucleoprotein many times larger and capable of messenger-directed synthesis required many additional steps that are not yet obvious.

Ribosomal 50S subunit crystals were stabilized and then soaked for 24 hours in stabilization buffer plus 100 M CCdA-p-puromycin or N-amino-acylated mini-helices before cryovitrification in liquid propane and x-ray diffraction data collection. Phases were calculated by density modification (crystallographic and NMR system) beginning with the best experimental phases (35) using 2Fo(analog) ­ Fo(native) for amplitudes, from 60.0 to 3.2 Å. Native amplitudes were from the most isomorphous native 1 data set, except for those amplitudes that were present only in the more complete native 2 data set. Calculated 2Fo ­ Fo amplitudes that were less than twice the corresponding calculated were replaced by Fo(analog). Maps were then calculated using phases from density modified and 2Fo(analog) ­ Fo(native) or Fo(analog) ­ Fo(native) amplitudes. 39. R. R. Samaha, R. Green, H. F. Noller, Nature 377, 309 (1995). 40.

Magnetic Vortex Core Observation in Circular Dots of Permalloy
T. Shinjo,1* T. Okuno,1 R. Hassdorf,1 K. Shigeto,1 T. Ono2
Spin structures of nanoscale magnetic dots are the subject of increasing scientific effort, as the confinement of spins imposed by the geometrical restrictions makes these structures comparable to some internal characteristic length scales of the magnet. For a vortex (a ferromagnetic dot with a curling magnetic structure), a spot of perpendicular magnetization has been theoretically predicted to exist at the center of the vortex. Experimental evidence for this magnetization spot is provided by magnetic force microscopy imaging of circular dots of permalloy (Ni80Fe20) 0.3 to 1 micrometer in diameter and 50 nanometers thick. Ferromagnetic materials generally form domain structures to reduce their magnetostatic energy. In very small ferromagnetic systems, however, the formation of domain walls is not energetically favored. Specifically, in a dot of ferromagnetic material of micrometer or submicrometer size, a curling spin configuration-- that is, a magnetization vortex (Fig. 1)--has been proposed to occur in place of domains. When the dot thickness becomes much smaller than the dot diameter, usually all spins tend to align in-plane. In the curling configuration, the spin directions change gradually in-plane so as not to lose too much exchange energy, but to cancel the total dipole energy. In the vicinity of the dot center, the angle between adjacent spins then becomes increasingly larger when the spin directions remain confined in-plane. Therefore, at the core of the vortex structure, the magne1

tization within a small spot will turn out-ofplane and parallel to the plane normal. Although the concept of such a magnetic vortex with a turned-up magnetization core has been introduced in many textbooks (1), direct experimental evidence for this phenomenon has been lacking. Recent model calculations for a Heisenberg spin system of 32 32 8 spins in size (2) indicate that a curling spin structure is realized even for a dot of square shape, where a spot with turned-up magnetization normal to the plane exists at the center of the vortex (Fig. 1). The simulations, which are based on a discreteupdate Monte Carlo method described elsewhere (3), take account of exchange and dipole energies while neglecting anisotropy. Further, they show that no out-of-plane component of the magnetization occurs if the dot thickness becomes too small. On the other hand, when the thickness exceeds a certain limit, the top and bottom spin layers will tend to cancel each other, and again no perpendicular magnetization should be observed. A vortex core with perpendicular magnetization is therefore expected to appear if the shape, size, and thickness of the dot are all

appropriate, and the anisotropy energy may be neglected. A number of experiments have been carried out to study nanoscale magnetic systems. Cowburn et al. reported magneto-optical measurements on nanoscale supermalloy (Ni80Fe14Mo5) dot arrays (4). From the profiles of the hysteresis loops, they concluded that a collinear-type single-domain phase is stabilized in dots with diameters smaller than a critical value (about 100 nm) and that a vortex phase likely occurs in dots with larger diameters. However, the authors were not able to obtain direct information on the spin structure in each dot. As suggested by theoretical calculations, the size of the perpendicular magnetization spot at the vortex core should be fairly small, and hence conventional magnetization measurements should fail to distinguish a fraction of perpendicular magnetization from the surrounding vortex magnetic structure. In this context, we report magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements on circular dots of permalloy (Ni80Fe20) that give clear evidence for the existence of a vortex spin structure with perpendicular magnetization core. Samples of ferromagnetic dots were prepared by means of electron-beam lithography and evaporation in an ultrahigh vacuum using an electron-beam gun. The desired patterns were defined on thermally oxidized Si substrates capped by a layer of resist and subsequently topped by a layer of permalloy. By a lift-off process, the resist is removed and permalloy dots with designed sizes remain on top of the Si surface. The thickness of the circular dots reported here is 50 nm; the diameter of the dots was varied from 0.1 to 1 m. In MFM, the instrument was operated in ac mode to detect the magnetic force acting between the cantilever tip and the surface of the permalloy dots. A low-moment ferromagnetic tip of CoCr was used to minimize the effect of stray fields. The distance between tip and sample surface was set to 80 nm on average. Sample scans
