In gram-negative bacteria the major component of transcriptional control is the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which acts primarily as a global transcriptional activator in the presence of cAMP (Magasanik, 1970; Ullmann and Danchin, 1983; Bruckner and Titgemeyer, 2002). However, unlike gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria do not encode a CRP protein nor do they contain or respond to cAMP (Saier et al., 1995). Instead, these bacteria employ a completely different mechanism of CCR whereby the transcription of catabolic genes is controlled by three main components, the carbon catabolite protein A (CcpA), a master transcriptional regulator with both repressor and activator activities, the histidine-containing protein (HPr), and catabolite responsive element (cre) DNA sites, which are bound by CcpA (Henkin, 1996; Jones et al., 1997a; Warner and Lolkema, 2003). CcpA has been identified in over 20 low-GC grampositive bacteria (Kraus et al., 1998). Extensive mutagenesis studies on cre sequences from several B. subtilis promoters revealed the consensus pseudopalindromic sequence, WTGNAANCGNWNNCWW (where W A or T and N any base; Weickert and Chambliss, 1989; Miwa et al., 2000). Approximately 10% of the B. subtilis genome responds directly or indirectly to CcpA, underscoring the vital metabolic role played by CcpA (Moreno et al., 2001). The multiple genes regulated by CcpA encode proteins involved in carbon metabolism and utilization, including enzymes, transporters, and transcription factors (Moreno et al., 2001). The location of the cre site(s) within a given promoter appears to determine whether CcpA functions as a repressor or activator; promoters with upstream cre sites are activated by CcpA, while promoters with overlapping cre sites are repressed (Gosseringer et al., 1997; Zalieckas et al., 1998; ¨ Turinsky et al., 1998; Zalieckas et al., 1999; Miwa and Fujita, 2001). CcpA is a member of the LacI-GalR family of transcription regulators (Weickert and Adhya, 1992). Structures are available for only two full-length LacI-GalR members bound to DNA, those of the purine repressor (PurR) and the lactose repressor (LacI) (Schumacher et al., 1994, 1995; Lewis et al., 1996; Bell and Lewis, 2000, 2001). These structures reveal that the first 60 N-terminal residues of these regulators constitute the DNA binding domain while a larger C-terminal domain, which resembles the periplasmic sugar binding proteins (PBPs; Quiocho and Ledvina, 1996), is responsible for oligomerization and effector binding. Like PurR, CcpA is a dimer. The latter PBP domain has a two-subdomain architecture consisting of an N subdomain and a C subdomain connected by a crossover region. Relative movements of the subdomains lead to "open" and "closed" states of the protein. In both PurR and LacI the closed state facilitates optimal juxtaposition of the attached hinge region of the DNA binding domains, thereby permitting "hinge" helix formation and DNA binding when cognate DNA is present. Interestingly, the DNA bound states of PurR and LacI are similar structurally, yet in PurR the

Summary Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is one of the most fundamental environmental-sensing mechanisms in bacteria and imparts competitive advantage by establishing priorities in carbon metabolism. In gram-positive bacteria, the master transcription regulator of CCR is CcpA. CcpA is a LacI-GalR family member that employs, as an allosteric corepressor, the phosphoprotein HPr-Ser46-P, which is formed in glucose-replete conditions. Here we report structures of the Bacillus megaterium apoCcpA and a CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-DNA complex. These structures reveal that HPr-Ser46-P mediates a novel two-component allosteric DNA binding activation mechanism that involves both rotation of the CcpA subdomains and relocation of pivot-point residue Thr61, which leads to juxtaposition of the DNA binding regions permitting "hinge" helix formation in the presence of cognate DNA. The structure of the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre complex also reveals the elegant mechanism by which CcpA family-specific interactions with HPr-Ser46-P residues Ser46-P and His15 partition the high-energy CCR and low-energy PTS pathways, the latter requiring HPr-His15-P. Introduction Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is the global regulatory mechanism that permits bacteria to utilize, out of a mixture of compounds, the carbon source that allows the fastest growth rate (Stulke and Hillen, 2000; Bruckner ¨ and Titgemeyer, 2002). CCR is one of the most fundamental and oldest mechanisms used for environmental sensing and chemical communication and is critical for successful competition in diverse and frequently changing conditions. In CCR, the presence of a preferred carbon source, like glucose, represses the synthesis of enzymes required for the metabolism of other less efficiently catabolized carbon sources. This repression establishes priorities in the utilization of carbon and energy sources according to their selective advantage. At the heart of CCR is a complex feedback mechanism in which the production of proteins involved in carbohydrate ca*Correspondence: brennanr@ohsu.edu

DNA binding-competent state is created by binding corepressor, either hypoxanthine or guanine, in the cavity between the N and C subdomains, while in LacI the apo form is the DNA bound state (i.e., not effector bound; Schumacher et al., 1994, 1995; Lewis et al., 1996; Bell and Lewis, 2000, 2001). Thus, although LacI-GalR proteins are highly conserved structurally in their DNA bound forms, their specific mechanisms of DNA binding differ. In this regard one of the more novel LacI-GalR proteins is CcpA, as it uses a protein, rather than a small molecule, to effect DNA binding. Some studies have suggested that CcpA may utilize, directly or indirectly, small molecules such as NADP, glucose-6-phosphate, or fructose-1,6-bisphosphate as corepressors, but these data are equivocal (Gosseringer et al., 1997; Kim et al., ¨ 1998). By contrast multiple studies have established clearly that the Ser46-phosphorylated form of HPr (HPrSer46-P) activates CcpA to bind cre sites. A direct physical interaction between these proteins has been incontrovertibly demonstrated by retarded gel elution of HPr-Ser46-P from CcpA-attached columns, electrophoretic gel mobility assays, and NMR measurements (Jones et al., 1997a; Galinier et al., 1999; Aung-Hilbrich et al., 2002). However, the mechanism by which HPrSer46-P functions as an allosteric effector of CcpA is unknown. HPr is itself a central metabolic sensor in low-GC gram-positive bacteria, where it plays a dual role that is mediated through its phosphorylation state and site of phosphorylation. Under conditions of low intracellular glucose concentrations, residue His15 is phosphorylated to give HPr-His15-P, which has a catalytic function in sugar uptake in the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase systems (PTS) as well as regulatory functions by phosphorylation of catabolic enzymes and transcriptional regulators with a PTS regulation domain (PRD; Postma et al., 1993; Stulke and Hillen, 1998). By ¨ contrast, HPr-Ser46-P is produced by HPr kinase/phosphatase (HPrK/P) in response to high intracellular concentrations of glycolytic intermediates (Deutscher and Saier, 1983; Poncet et al., 2004). Moreover, studies have demonstrated that neither HPr-His15-P nor doubly phosphorylated HPr-(Ser46-P)-(His15-P) can bind CcpA or function in CCR, indicating the importance of an unphosphorylated residue 15 for CcpA binding (Reizer et al., 1996). In addition, the HPr-like protein, Crh (catabolite repression HPr), also functions as an effector for CcpA (Galinier et al., 1997, 1999). Crh contains the Ser46 residue, which can be phosphorylated by HPrK/P but lacks the PTS active site residue His15, which is replaced by a glutamine. Because HPr-His15-P cannot bind CcpA, overlap between the global PTS and CCR metabolic pathways is precluded. However, the finding that both HPr-Ser46-P and Crh-Ser46-P function as effectors for CcpA indicates that either a histidine or a glutamine at position 15 is functional for CcpA binding. To understand how HPr-Ser46-P functions as an allosteric effector to activate cre binding by CcpA and thus gain critical insight into CCR in gram-positive bacteria, we determined the crystal structures of apoCcpA and a CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre ternary complex. The CcpA(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre ternary complex provides the first atomic view of an intact phosphoprotein-transcription regulator-DNA complex. Strikingly, the ternary structure

also reveals a simple but elegant mechanism whereby three CcpA family-specific residues effect CCR and discriminate against PTS. Finally, comparison of the ternary structure with the apoCcpA structure reveals a novel mechanism of phosphoprotein-mediated allosteric DNA binding activation. Results and Discussion Global Structure of the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre DNA Complex The B. megaterium CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre DNA complex was crystallized by mixing equimolar amounts of B. megaterium CcpA and HPr-Ser46-P and a 16 base pair (bp) duplex cre. The structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement (MR) and multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) (Experimental Procedures; Figures 1A­1D; Table 1). The crystallographic asymmetric unit (ASU) contains two CcpA-(HPr-Ser46P)-cre ternary complexes. The current model includes residues 1­332 of the four CcpA subunits, residues 2­88 of the four HPr-Ser46-P proteins, and all nucleotides of the two 16 bp cre duplexes. The Rwork and Rfree are 24.2% ° and 28.8%, respectively, to 2.80 A resolution (Table 1). The CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre ternary structure reveals that HPr-Ser46-P binds the surface of CcpA with a stoichiometry of one HPr-Ser46-P molecule per CcpA subunit. Thus, in accord with previous biochemical studies, the complex contains one cre duplex, one CcpA dimer, and two HPr-Ser46-P molecules (Figure 1A; Jones et al., 1997a). The structure of CcpA (332 residues) is similar to those of LacI-GalR family members PurR and LacI (Supplemental Figure S1 at http://www.cell.com/cgi/ content/full/118/6/731/DC1; Schumacher et al., 1994, 1995; Lewis et al., 1996) and is composed of an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a C-terminal dimerization/ corepressor (HPr-Ser46-P) binding domain. The former domain has two distinct DNA binding elements: a threehelix bundle, where helices 1 and 2 form the major groove binding helix-turn-helix motif (HTH) (helix 1: residues 5­12, helix 2: 16­24, helix 3: 31­44), and the hinge helix, helix 4 (residues 50­57), which inserts into the minor groove of the central CpG step, thereby kinking the DNA (Figure 1B). The CcpA dimerization/corepressor binding domain, or "core," includes residues 61­332 and contains an / fold with nine helices (I: residues 73­88, II: 102­115, III: 129­136, IV: 161­175, V: 190­206, VI: 223­234, VII: 248­261, VIII: 279­281, IX: 294­309) and 11 strands (A: 61­67, B: 92­98, C: 119­122, D: 141­146, E: 156­158, F: 179­184, G: 215­219, H: 242­246, I: 270­275, J: 288­292, K: 317­321). The CcpA core is composed of structurally similar N and C subdomains (Figures 1A and 1B). The N subdomain consists of a six-stranded parallel sheet, A­E and J, surrounded by four helices, I­III and IX. The C subdomain contains five strands, F­I and K, and five surrounding helices, IV­VIII. The subdomains are connected by three crossovers, E to IV, I to IX, and J to K, that together act as a joint to permit rotation of the two subdomains. The CcpA ° dimerization interface is extensive and buries 3976 A2 ° 2 per monomer). Consurface area from solvent (1988 A tacts between the two N subdomains are mediated by residues 61­62 and 68­115.

consists of several noncontiguous regions that encompass residues 223, 252­260, and 279­282. Whereas LacI and PurR bind small molecule effectors, either corepressors or inducers, in the cleft between the N and C subdomains to regulate DNA binding (Schumacher et al., 1994, 1995; Lewis et al., 1996), CcpA utilizes the phosphoprotein, HPr-Ser46-P, as a corepressor. The four phosphorylated HPr proteins are structurally identical as evidenced from superimpositions of all C atoms (2­88); the superimpositions result ° in an average rmsd of 0.52 A. HPr-Ser46-P contains three helices ( 1: residues 17­26, 2: 47­52, 3: 70­84) and five strands, ( 1: 2­8, 2: 32­37, 3: 40­44, 4: 59­66, 5: 86­88). Comparison of the HPr-Ser46-P structure in our ternary complex to the free conformation of the highly homologous Enterococcus faecalis HPrSer46-P (63% sequence identity) results in an average ° rmsd of 0.5 A, indicating no global structural changes

are induced in HPr-Ser46-P upon CcpA binding (Audette et al., 2000). CcpA-cre Operator Contacts: Plasticity of CcpA HTH Motifs The HTH motifs and hinge helices of the CcpA dimer make a total of 32 phosphate contacts and interact with 10 bp of the 16 bp cre (Figures 2A­2C). These interac° tions bury 3460 A2 solvent-accessible area (ASA). CcpA, like other LacI-GalR proteins, specifies its binding site by DNA kinking, which allows formation of operatorspecific HTH-major groove contacts (Figures 2A­2C). The most conserved base pairs of the cre consensus sequence, WTGNAANCGNWNNCWW (Weickert and Chambliss, 1990; Miwa et al., 2000), are the Gua:Cyt bps corresponding to Cyt(8A):Gua(8B) and Gua(9A):Cyt(9B) (bolded), and Gua(3A):Cyt(3B) and Cyt(14A):Gua(14B) (underlined) in the cre used here (Figure 1C).

and Gua(14B) bases are specified by hydrogen bonds from HTH residue Arg21, which is conserved in all CcpA proteins, while conserved residue Leu55, the "leucine lever," and its dyadic mate intercalate between the bases of the universally conserved central Cyt(8A): Gua(8B) and Gua(9A):Cyt(9B) bp steps. Leucine intercalation, also observed in the PurR-DNA and LacI-DNA complexes, results in DNA kinking and minor groove expansion. However, unlike the PurR bound purF operator, in which the entire minor groove is widened, the minor groove width of the CcpA bound cre is expanded ° only near the central GpCpGpCp sequence to 9.1 A­ ° ° 12.9 A but returns to a B-DNA width (5.7 A) near the DNA 5 ends. Additionally, the global-bend angles of the DNA bound by CcpA, PurR, and LacI are different. PurR (Schumacher et al., 1994) and LacI (Lewis et al., 1996) bend their operators by 50 and 40 , respectively, compared with 35 for CcpA bound cre. The cre site used in the study is pseudopalindromic; thus, CcpA contacts to dyad-related bps 4 (a T·A in half-site 1) and 12 (an A·T in half-site 2) differ: in halfsite 1 Ser15 and Ala17 contact Thy4A, while in halfsite 2 Ala17 contacts Ade12B (Figures 1C and 2A­2C). Modeling reveals that the orientation of the HTH bound

at half-site 1 cannot interact with the DNA sequence of half-site 2 due to steric clash between Ala17 and Ade4A. Thus, the precise docking of each CcpA HTH is contingent upon the DNA sequence. Despite this different docking, key base and phosphate contacts are preserved in each half-site. In short, CcpA, like other LacIGalR family members, uses its leucine levers to evoke reconfiguration of the cre so that major groove bases can be read specifically. However, the HTH motifs of CcpA display significant plasticity in their ability to bind half-sites with altered sequences, thereby providing a molecular explanation for the degenerate sequence of many cre site positions (Miwa et al., 2000). Intriguingly, structures of LacI bound to a symmeterized operator and its natural, longer operator, O1, also revealed a remarkable capacity for plasticity in DNA binding by LacI, in that the global positioning of the LacI dimer on O1 is highly asymmetric, resulting in a markedly different pattern of specific contacts between the two DNA halfsites (Kalodimos et al., 2002). In this regard, it is also interesting to note that CcpA and LacI display strikingly similar DNA contacts and marked conservation of their DNA binding residues. These overall findings suggest a similarity in the recognition strategies utilized by CcpA

CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P) Interactions The complex between CcpA and HPr-Ser46-P buries ° 1400 A2 ASA. All contacts from HPr-Ser46-P are made to residues of the N subdomains of CcpA. The primary interaction interface is forged between HPr-Ser46-P residues, which are located on 1, 2, the turn between 1 and 1, and the surface-exposed regions of CcpA helices I and IX (Figure 3A). CcpA helix IX, which plays the preeminent role in HPr-Ser46-P binding, contains a large number of hydrophobic residues that are conserved in CcpA family proteins, including Tyr295, Ala299, Val300, and Leu304. These residues form a tight interface with HPr-Ser46-P residues Ile47, Met48, and Met51 (Figure 3A). Sequence alignments of the more than 20 CcpA family proteins reveal that residues on helix IX are among the most conserved (Figure 4). Such CcpAspecific residues, or residues confined to the CcpA fam-

ily, are not only critical in HPr-Ser46-P binding but also play key roles in the allosteric mechanism mediated by HPr-Ser46-P (see below). Moreover, mutagenesis studies have revealed that CcpA family-specific residues Tyr295 and Ala299 are essential for HPr-Ser46-P binding (Kraus et al., 1998). An important feature of the CcpAHPr-Ser46-P complex is that each HPr-Ser46-P molecule interacts with the N subdomains of both subunits of the CcpA dimer, whereby each HPr-Ser46-P molecule contacts helices I and IX of one CcpA subunit and helices I and II (where indicates the other subunit of the dimer; Figures 3A and 3B). One HPr-Ser46-P residue, Arg17, plays the critical role in this bridging interaction by directly contacting CcpA residues Asp84 and Asp69 and Asp99 . CcpA-Specific Interactions with HPr Ser46-P and His15: Discrimination of the PTS and CCR Pathways HPr cannot bind CcpA unless HPr residue Ser46 is phosphorylated (Jones et al., 1997a; Aung-Hilbrich et al.,

Relevant CcpA side chains are shown as green and red sticks and those of HPr-Ser46-P as blue sticks, except the His15 and Ser46-P side chains, which are shown according to atom type with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorous atoms colored white, blue, red, and yellow, respectively. Interactions are indicated by dashed lines. (B) Stereo view showing a closeup of key CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P) interactions, which occur between HPr-Ser46-P residues His15 and Ser46-P and CcpA residues Asp296 and Arg303 and Lys307, respectively.

2002). Phosphorylation increases the binding affinity of CcpA for HPr by over 50-fold, indicating that recognition of the Ser46-P residue is central to both binding specificity and affinity (Aung-Hilbrich et al., 2002). The crystal structure reveals that the Ser46-P residue is surrounded by two CcpA basic residues, Arg303 and Lys307, which are located on helix IX (Figures 3A and 3B). Arg303, using its NH2 and N atoms, makes hydrogen bonds to two oxygens of the phosphate moiety. The side chain of Tyr89 plays a key role in positioning this series of specific interactions by hydrogen bonding with the NH1 atom of the Arg303 guanidinium group. Consistent with the structure, mutagenesis studies demonstrated that CcpA-specific residues Tyr89 and Arg303 are essential for HPr-Ser46-P binding (Kraus et al., 1998). The remaining oxygen of the Ser46-P phosphate moiety is contacted by CcpA-specific residue Lys307. These contacts effectively lock the Ser46-P group into a small pocket, which is formed by an extended loop that traverses helix IX to strand E (Figures 3A and 3B; Supplemental Figure S2 on the Cell website) and is found in neither PurR nor LacI, on the surface of the CcpA molecule. The PTS transports sugars into the cell via a phosphotransfer relay, which utilizes the phosphoryl group of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phosphorylate incoming sugars via the transfer process PEPenzyme I HPrenzyme IIAenzyme IIBCsugar-P (Postma et al., 1993). Whereas HPr-Ser46-P is produced in re-

sponse to high intracellular concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, phosphorylation of HPr at N 1 on His15, creating HPr-His15-P, is dependent on the presence of PEP and substrate (Postma et al., 1993; Jones et al., 1997b; Stulke and Hillen, 2000; Nessler et al., 2003). ¨ Interestingly, NMR studies revealed that His15 phosphorylation in B. subtilis is accompanied by localized structural changes in HPr near the N terminus of 1. These changes allow the His15 phosphate group to hydrogen bond with amide nitrogens of the 1 N terminus and to interact favorably with the helix dipole. By contrast, phosphorylation of Ser46 leaves the HPr structure essentially unchanged (Audette et al., 2000). It has been clearly demonstrated that CcpA cannot bind HPr-His15P, while the Ser46 phosphorylated HPr, HPr-Ser46-P, is unable to act as a phosphocarrier substrate in the enzyme I (EI) reaction of PTS (Reizer et al., 1996). Specifically, phosphorylation of Ser46 leads to disruption of the hydrophobic interactions between E1 and HPr (Audette et al., 2000). Thus, phosphorylation of HPr residue His15 is incompatible with binding and activation of CcpA, while Ser46 phosphorylation of HPr is required for CcpA interaction and at the same time prevents interactions required for PTS. These phosphorylation events, therefore, prevent overlap of the PTS and CCR pathways. Interestingly, however, His15 is critical for CcpA binding to HPr-Ser46-P, as mutating this residue to an aspartic acid abrogates binding (Reizer et al., 1996). Yet a glutamine at position 15 is still functional for CcpA binding because Crh-Ser46-P binds CcpA and participates in CCR (Galinier et al., 1999). The CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre structure reveals the basis for the ability of CcpA to discriminate against doubly phosphorylated HPr-(Ser46-P)-(His15-P) yet still bind Crh-Ser46-P. Simply, conserved CcpA residue Asp296 engages in hydrogen bonds with the N 1 of His15 and the backbone amide nitrogen of Ala16 of the HPr-Ser46P molecule (Figures 3A and 3B). Because Asp296 interacts directly with the N 1 of His15, phosphorylation of this atom, which occurs during PTS, would clearly preclude CcpA binding through steric clash and electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, the localized structural changes that are associated with His15 phosphorylation, including rearrangement of 1, are incompatible with CcpA binding. Also, substitution of His15 to aspartate would introduce charge-charge repulsion and prevent binding. By contrast, modeling reveals that replacement of His15 with a glutamine, as found in Crh, would retain the hydrogen bond with Asp296 of CcpA, whereby the N atom of the glutamine side chain would interact with the carboxylate side chain (Supplemental Figure S3 on the Cell website). Although HPr shares only 45% sequence identity with Crh, B. megaterium HPr residues Ala16, Arg17, Gln24, Ile47, Met48, and Met51, which are important for CcpA binding, are conserved in Crh. This information supports the supposition that the CrhSer46-P and HPr-Ser46-P interactions with CcpA are identical. Mechanism of HPr-Ser46-P-Mediated DNA Binding by CcpA Elucidation of the mechanism of HPr-Ser46-P mediated CcpA-cre binding requires, in addition to the CcpA-(HPr-

CcpB_Bsu shares 30% sequence identity with CcpA; however, CcpB does not contain residues necessary for HPr-Ser46-P binding. The lack of HPr-Ser46-P binding residues in CcpB is consistent with the fact that CcpB has a different cellular function, which is dependent upon changes in oxygen supply and cell density (Chauvaux et al., 1998).

Ser46-P)-cre ternary complex, the structure of unliganded CcpA, i.e., apoCcpA as well. Thus, we determined the structure of apoCcpA from three different crystal forms. Overall, these crystals contained ten apo dimers, thus providing 20 crystallographically independent views of the apoCcpA subunit conformation (Experimental Procedures; Table 1). Comparison of the CcpA ternary complex conformation with apo structures revealed a novel two-component allosteric mechanism involving both global and local conformational changes. Superimpositions show that, like PurR and LacI, the C subdomains and C subdomain dimerization interface of CcpA remain unchanged between the two forms (rmsds ° ° [average] 0.3­0.6 A for apo/apo and 0.5­0.6 A for apo/ ternary superimpositions). Overlaying the C subdomains of the individual apoCcpA structures reveals a small range of rotational difference between the N and C subdomains (Figure 5A). Similar rotational ranges of "open" states have been observed for PurR and the PBPs. However, when compared to the apo state, the activated CcpA N subdomains are rotated "closed" by 3 to 8 (average 6 ; Figure 5A). Such N subdomain rotations were also observed in PurR ( 20 ) and LacI (6 ) (Schu-

macher et al., 1994, 1995; Lewis et al., 1996). The simultaneous rotation of both CcpA N subdomains leads to a large change in the N subdomain dimer interface whereby the intersubunit sheet formed between the N subdomains ratchets from one set of hydrogen bonds to another (Figure 5B). This N subdomain rotation and ratcheting effects the placement of the attached hinge/ DNA binding regions such that in the closed state, the hinge regions are closer together. In PurR and LacI, N subdomain rotations appear to play the primary role in DNA binding activation. Importantly, because each HPrSer46-P interacts with both N subdomains of the dimer, HPr-Ser46-P binding serves to link and coordinate the structural changes of the N subdomains. The rotation of the CcpA N subdomains also positions N subdomain residues to interact with DNA binding domains of the other subunit. These crossdomain interactions, which likely stabilize the ternary complex, include hydrogen bonds between Gln116 and Asn49 and van der Waals contacts between the Gln116 side chain methylene carbons to the side chain of hinge helix residue Val51 . In addition, Gly114 hydrogen bonds to the amide nitrogen of Ala50 , and the C-terminal helix dipole of core helix

II interacts with Arg47 . The important role that these contacts play in DNA binding is supported by studies demonstrating that an Arg47Ser substitution yields a CcpA protein that binds HPr-Ser46-P but is defective in CCR as it can no longer bind DNA (Kraus et al., 1998). The allosteric mechanism of CcpA is very different from those of PurR and LacI in that beyond the more global N subdomain rotations that all undergo, CcpA displays significant local structural changes near its DNA binding domains. These changes are directly induced by HPr-Ser46-P binding, are critical for the activation mechanism, and are observed in comparisons of the activated structure with all 20 apo structures. In the apo form, the position of helix IX is different from its location in the activated state, and contacts between CcpA residues in helix IX and HPr-Ser46-P, originating from CcpA residue Arg303, cause a chain reaction that ultimately impinges upon Thr61 at the core/DNA binding junction. Specifically, in order for the Ser46 phosphate moiety to contact Arg303, the arginine side chain must rotate, which causes a concomitant shift in the position of Tyr89 and thus the entire "Tyr89 loop" (residues 89­91; Figure 6A). As a result, the hydrogen bond found between the side chains of Tyr91 and Thr306 in the apo form breaks thereby allowing Tyr91 to rotate toward the CcpA dimer interface. This rotation forces the relocation of Thr61 ( phi/psi [DNA bound/DNA-free] for Thr61 159 ) such that the entire residue is pushed up and away from the core, leading to the direct juxtaposition of the hinge regions (Figure 6B). The important role that Thr306 plays in this mechanism is underscored by the finding that a T306W mutation leads to constitutive or HPrSer46-P-independent activation of CcpA (W.H., unpublished data). This result is consonant with our structures, which suggest that Tyr91 would be expelled from the

pocket in the presence of the larger Trp306 side chain and, in turn, flip the Thr61 switch, leading to DNA binding activation. Examination of CcpA sequence alignments reveals that residues critical for the allosteric switch, including Thr61, Tyr89, Tyr91, and Thr306, are absolutely conserved among CcpA family proteins (Figure 4). Thus, these residues, along with the conserved stretch of residues in helix IX, can serve as a signature for CcpA proteins that function in CCR through HPr-Ser46-P. LacI-GalR DNA Binding Mechanisms: Different Routes to a Similar Endpoint Comparison of the DNA bound form of CcpA to those of PurR and LacI reveal that all three have highly homologous structures. Indeed, the DNA bound forms of the PurR and LacI dimers can be optimally superimposed ° ° onto the CcpA dimer with rmsds of 1.8 A and 2.0 A for 544 and 570 corresponding C atoms, respectively (Supplemental Figure S1 on the Cell website). However, the DNA-free or "open" forms of these proteins have very different conformations. This difference appears to reflect the distinct nature of the latent N subdomain switches that the proteins each possess. As a result, these proteins take very different routes to obtain a remarkably similar end result. LacI and PurR are more similar in that effector binding in the intrasubunit pocket, ° 40 A from the DNA binding domain, locks these repressors in either a closed conformation (PurR) or an open conformation (LacI), thus altering their N subdomain conformations and leading to either association of the hinge regions and DNA binding activation (PurR) or dissociation of the hinge regions and induction (LacI). By sharp contrast, HPr-Ser46-P binds to the surface of both CcpA subunits near their DNA binding domains, and the allosteric activation mechanism of CcpA is a two-

tography and gel filtration (Sephacryl HR200). HPr was phosphorylated stoichiometrically on residue Ser46 by B. subtilis HPr kinase/ phosphatase as described (Steinhauer et al., 2002). For crystallization (hanging drop-vapor diffusion) CcpA was mixed with approximately equimolar amounts of HPr-Ser46-P and the duplex cre site (1[CcpA dimer]:2[HPr-Ser46-P]:1 cre duplex). The complex was mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution of 2.0 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0), 10 mM MgSO4, and 6%­10% DMSO at 298 K. The crystals display strong pseudo-orthorhombic symmetry but are monoclinic, ° ° ° space group P21, with a 105.72 A, b 109.21 A, c 117.80 A, and 90.02 . For cryoprotection, glycerol was added to the drop to a final concentration of 50%, and crystals were flash frozen in a nitrogen cryostream. MAD data were collected at ALS beamline 8.2.1 and native intensity data at ALS beamline 5.0.2, both at 100 K. All data were processed with MOSFLM.

(B) Ultimate result of HPr-Ser46-P binding: ribbon diagram of the overlay shown in Figure 5B with HPr-Ser46-P removed for clarity. Movement of the N subdomains and residue Thr61 leads to the juxtaposition of the hinge region (black arrows) in the HPr-Ser46-P bound form (red) to allow the formation of the hinge helices in the presence of cognate DNA. In the apoCcpA, the hinge regions of each CcpA subunit are far apart (cyan).

Structure Determination and Refinement of the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre Complex The structure of the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre complex was solved by a combination of MR and MAD (Table 1). MR was carried out with evolutionary programming for molecular replacement (EPMR; Kissinger et al., 1999) using the coordinates of the dimeric PurRpurF operator complex (Schumacher et al., 1994). Refinement of the single solution in CNS and solvent flipping resulted in sufficient phasing power that revealed density for the second CcpA dimercre and two of the HPr-Ser46-P molecules (Brunger et al., 1998). ¨ However, the solution could only be refined to an Rfree of 44.0%. Thus, MAD data were collected and selenium sites were located using the MR model phases. The MAD maps revealed clear density for the complex, and after model building in O, refinement converged ° to an Rfree of 33.0% for the MAD data (to 3.3 A resolution), at which ° point the model was refined against the native 2.8 A resolution data (Jones et al., 1991; Brunger et al., 1998). After several rounds of ¨ rebuilding in O and refinement in CNS, the Rfree converged to 28.8%. Overlays of the two independent CcpA dimers in the ASU that bind ° the same DNA orientation result in an rmsd of 0.61 A for all corresponding CcpA and HPr-Ser46-P C atoms, revealing their structural identity. The current model has excellent stereochemistry (Laskowski et al., 1993) and includes residues 1­332 of the four CcpA subunits, residues 2­88 of the four HPr-Ser46-P proteins, all nucleotides of the two 16 bp cre duplexes as well as 82 water molecules, 7 sulfate ions, and 2 magnesium ions (Table 1).

component mechanism utilizing not only subunit rotation but also local structural changes in the N subdomain that impinge on Thr61, located at the juncture between the core and the DNA binding domain. These latter structural changes lead to direct hinge region apposition (Figure 6B). Whether other LacI-GalR members utilize global, local, or combinations of these transitions remains to be determined. Finally, phosphorylation is commonly used by eukaryotes to recruit proteins to transcription regulatory complexes. The CcpA-(HPrSer46-P)-cre complex provides the first atomic view of an analogous transcription regulatory mechanism in prokaryotes.
Experimental Procedures Protein Preparation, Crystallization, and Data Collection: CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre Complex B. megaterium CcpA and HPr were expressed in B. megaterium. CcpA was purified using Q sepharose chromatography followed by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. For preparation of the selenomethionesubstituted CcpA, the protein was expressed in E. coli utilizing the methionine inhibitory pathway. CcpA was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, and 1% EDTA. B. megaterium HPr was purified using Q sepharose chroma-

Protein Preparation, Crystallization, and Data Collection: apoCcpA Full-length B. megaterium apoCcpA did not crystallize, and previous studies on LacI family members, including studies on CcpA, have demonstrated that the hinge region of these proteins is unfolded in the DNA-free state (Schumacher et al., 1994, 1995; Lewis et al., 1996; Jones et al., 1997a). Indeed, in structural studies on full-length IPTG bound LacI, the DNA binding domains were unobserveable (Lewis et al., 1996). Thus, purified B. megaterium CcpA was proteolysed with clostripain, which cleaves specifically after Arg53. Activated clostripain (in 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 5 mM CaCl2) was added to CcpA in the same buffer at a ratio of 1:100 and incubated at 21 C for 4 hr. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 mM EDTA, and the protein was immediately concentrated, washed with 20 mM Tris 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and used for crystallization. Three different crystal forms were obtained. Their space groups, crystallographic parameters, crystallization conditions, and number of dimers/ASU are for form 1 (C2; a ° ° ° 375.39 A, b 60.14 A, c 75.65 A, 95.59 ; 20% PEG MME 3350, 0.1 M CHES [pH 9.5]; 3 dimers/ASU); form 2 (P212121; a ° ° ° 72.68 A, b 72.19 A, c 105.83 A; 25% PEG MME 3350, 0.2 M ° NaCl, 0.1 M HEPES [pH 7.5]; 1 dimer/ASU); form 3 (P21; a 110.26 A, ° ° b 106.94 A, c 157.81 A, 108.22 ; 15% PEG 8000, 0.1 M Tris [pH 7.0], 0.2 M MgCl2; 6 dimers/ASU). The C2 and P212121 crystal forms were cryo-protected by 50% PEG MME 3350 while the P21 crystals were cryo-preserved by 40% PEG 400, 0.1 M Tris 7.0, 0.2 M MgCl2. X-ray intensity data were collected at ALS beamline 8.2.1 and processed with MOSFLM.

Structure Determination and Refinement of the apoCcpA Crystals The P212121 crystal form, which contained one dimer in the ASU, was solved first by molecular replacement (MR) using the C domain dimer from the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre structure as a search model. After the N subdomains were located and the structure refined, this dimer (minus solvent) was used as the search model to solve the remaining structures. Although this search model represented only 1/6 of the P21 crystal form, five of the six dimers could be located with EPMR (Kissinger et al., 1999). Following initial refinement, the sixth subunit was easily placed. Using MR, this search model also located all three dimers of the C2 form. Following refinement in CNS, the Rwork/Rfree values converged to 21.4%/26.3%, 24.1%/27.3%, and 22.0%/28.4% for the C2, P212121, and P21 structures, respectively (Table 1). The C2 structure includes residues 58­332 of 2 subunits, residues 60­332 of the other 4 subunits, 145 waters, and 3 CHES molecules. The P212121 structure includes residues 60­332 of both subunits and 41 waters. The P21 structure includes residues 60­332 of the 12 subunits, 5 waters and 2 magnesium ions. All subunits have excellent stereochemistry.
