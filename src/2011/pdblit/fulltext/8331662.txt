INTRODUCTION

Glycogen phosphorylase (E.C. 2.4.1.1) catalyses the degradation of glycogen to glucose- lphosphate under physiological conditions. The enzyme can exist in two different forms, designated phosphorylase a and b, being active and inactive in the absence of AMP, respectively. Phosphorylase activity can be regulated by covalent modification (phosphorylationdephosphorylation reactions) (Fischer et al., 1959) and by allosteric modulation mediated by conformational changes induced by ligands binding to specific sites within the enzyme structure (Johnson et al., 1989). Four separate ligand binding sites were localized within the vertebrate glycogen phosphorylase structures: the active site which binds the substrates inorganic phosphate (Pi), glycogen and glucose- 1-phosphate; the nucleotide site or AMP allosteric site, which consists of three different subsites, namely the phosphoryl group, the ribosyl residue and the purine base-binding

loci; the nucleoside (or inhibitor) site and the glycogen storage site (Johnson et al., 1989; Dombrhdi, 1981; Newgard et al., 1989). Nucleosides, purine base analogues and heterocyclic compounds bind to the nucleoside site, thereby inducing an inactive conformation and acting like inhibitors (Steiner et al., 1980). Such compounds are able to bind the nucleotide site secondarily in competition with the allosteric effector, thus increasing their inhibitor effect (Johnson et al., 1979). In the present study, caffeine was used to obtain a better understanding of the function of two AMP binding sites (nucleotide and nucleoside) in phosphorylase from Mytilus mantle and the role of free nucleosides described in molluscs (Moal et al., 1987).
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Glycogen phosphorylase preparations were obtained from mussel mantle tissue previously stored at - 30°C. Phosphorylase b was prepared by homogenization in a 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer pH 7.0, containing 5 mM EDTA, imidazole and 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.12 M KCl.

Homogenate in the same conditions as above, but without EDTA, was incubated with ATP, MgCl, and CaCl, in a concentration of 2 mM in order to obtain a phosphorylase a suspension. In this medium, endogenous phosphorylase kinase transforms phosphorylase b into the a form (San Juan et al., 1995a). Both homogenates, containing b and a phosphorylase forms separately, were centrifuged at 15,4OOg,, for 20 min and the pellet was discarded. The supernatans were dialysed with 30 vol of extraction buffer containing IO mM NaF, but without KCl. Phosphorylase activity was examined in the direction of glycogen breakdown with a couple enzyme system, similar to the one described in Childress and Sacktor (1970). The reaction mixture for phosphorylase b contained 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer pH 7.0, 5 mM imidazole, 2 mM EDTA, 1.4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM acetate-Mg, 5 p M glucose ld-diphosphate, 0.6 mM NADP, 80 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 1.6 mM AMP, 16 mg/ml glycogen, 0.5 IU glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.1 IU phosphoglucomutase and the enzyme preparation in a total volume of 1.0 ml. EDTA and AMP were not added when assaying for phosphorylase a, and the glycogen and phosphate buffer concentrations were half the reaction mixture for the b form. The substrates, enzymes and coenzymes were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The salts and other chemicals were purchased from Merck. The inhibitory effect caused by several concentrations of caffeine was determined by a means of provoked modifications in the kinetic constants of glycogen phosphorylase in equilibrium, in relation to its substrates and specific effecters. The inhibitor action mechanism was determined, as a first approximation, using Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. When the enzyme activity no longer coincided with Michaelis-Menten kinetics and this plot became non-linear, plots of reciprocal velocity versus l/[S]* were used. When the inhibitory effect responded to a simple competitive model, then the inhibition constants were calculated from this plot and when it responded to a mixed inhibition model, then Ki was estimated from a secondary plot of double reciprocal slopes versus inhibitor concentrations (Segel, 1975). The allosteric constant (L) was calculated from the V,,,,, values obtained in the double

reciprocal plots. The data was analysed according to But's equation (But, 1967) for the exclusive bound model.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Caffeine inhibition of both forms (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) of glycogen phosphorylase from Myths mantle tissue has been proved. The inhibitor effect of this molecule is different in each form of mussel enzyme. Phosphorylase b inhibition The binding of this molecule to the unphosphorylated form (b form) stabilized an inactive conformation. This is confirmed by an increase in the allosteric constant L (constant equilibrium for the molar ratio between inactive and active conformers) from values of 50, in the absence of inhibitor (San Juan et al., 1995b), to 1500 in the presence of increasing caffeine concentrations (Fig. 1). In relation to glycogen, caffeine appears to affect phosphorylase b by competitive inhibition, with a K, of 0.18 mM (Fig. 2). The enzyme's affinity for the substrate decreases notably when the inhibitor concentration is increased and V,,,,, is maintained constant at all caffeine concentrations. However, a slight decrease in maximum velocity is observed at high caffeine concentrations (0.4 mM) (Table 1). The phosphorylase b conformation, promoted by caffeine binding to the nucleoside site, results

Caffeine is thus shown to be like a competitive inhibitor, but mediated by negative heterotropic effects since caffeine does not compete directly with the substrate for the same binding site. The I',,,, decrease at high inhibitor concentrations may be a consequence of secondary inhibitory binding to the nucleoTable 1.

tide site, thereby competing with the allosteric effector AMP. With regard to the Pi cosubstrate and allosteric effector, the inhibitor effect of caffeine is neither subject to the nomenclature of competitive inhibition described by Segel (1975), nor to the concerted symmetry model of allostery proposed by Monod et al. (1965) for vertebrate enzymes. In the aforementioned model, the caffeine effect on phosphorylase may be regarded as inhibition in an exclusive binding K system. However, the Lineweaver-Burk plots obtained from mussel phosphorylase b were non-linear and the reciprocal velocity plots versus l/[S]* did not show any classical competitive inhibition. Both affinity and V- decreased in the presence of caffeine, which indicates that caffeine was acting as a mixed inhibitor (Figs 3 and 4; Table 1). Mixed type inhibition is defined as a combination of competitive and non-competitive inhibition. From our results, we believe that this is due to, on the one hand, a non-competitive inhibition by caffeine binding at the nucleoside site, through negative cooperativity effects and, on the other hand, a competitive inhibition by caffeine binding at the nucleoside site: caffeine competes directly with AMP for the allosteric activator site and, at the same time, hinders the Pi access to its specific subsite within this locus. Thus, at high inhibitor concentrations, Pi is moved from the nucleotide binding site to the catalytic centre, and AMP

and caffeine compete for both binding sites, nucleotide and nucleoside, as the increase of Hill coefficients for Pi and AMP demonstrates (Table 1). The Ki values of this inhibitor, with regard to Pi and AMP (0.3 and 0.1 mM, respectively), was calculated from the inserted plots in Figs 3 and 4. A Hill plot (not shown), as a function of log [caffeine], yields a slope of 2. All of this suggests that the nucleoside site of Mytilus phosphoryl-

The phosphorylated form (a form) of Myti1u.s phosphorylase is not stimulated by any AMP concentrations (San Juan et al., 1995b). It is also inhibited by nucleoside analogues such as caffeine, thus differing from studied phosphorylases of other sources (Wang and Graves, 1964; Birnbaum and Fain, 1977; Burges et al., 1983; Deaciuc and Spitzer, 1986; Kamp, 1986). Caffeine inhibition, in mussel phosphorylase a, responds to a competitive inhibition as regards both enzyme substrates (glycogen and Pi). Such inhibition proceeds through negative heterotropic effects, the same as in the b form (Fig. 5). In both cases the inhibition only affects the affinity for the substrates. In reiation to glycogen, this inhibition results in a drastic increase K,,, (up to 20-fold in the presence of high caffeine concentrations). However, in the case of Pi this parameter is only modified slightly (Table 2). The allosteric constant for this phosphorylase form in the presence of caffeine was calculated to be almost 2. This is the same value as in the absence of the inhibitor (San Juan et al., 1995b). Likewise, the slope of the Hill plot as a function of caffeine concentration (not shown) is almost 1. The affinity of this form for caffeine is much higher than the b form. The Ki values obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 5) as a

In addition, this data confirms the secondary binding of caffeine and analogues to the allosteric effector site in phosphorylase b, as well as the important change in this site by covalent modification, demonstrated by a different inhibition way and different values of Ki in both enzymatic forms.

function of glycogen and Pi are 25 PM and 0.1 mM, respectively. Although AMP binding to Mytiius phosphorylase a has not been verified, the presence of 1.6 mM AMP decreased the caffeine inhibition by 55%. These results obtained from Mytilu.s phosphorylase a, compared with the results of phosphorylase b, reflect the notable modification provoked by the phosphorylation process in its quaternary and tertiary structure (Bardford et al., 1991). Furthermore, they suggest that the purine base-binding subsite, within the allosteric locus, is the most affected. There seems to exist only one binding site for the nucleoside analogues in the Myths phosphorylated form. This hypothesis explains the pure competitive inhibition, the inhibition decrease in the presence of AMP, which would therefore bind to the nucleoside site, and the high affinity for caffeine. In this enzyme form, we would only be measuring the affinity of the specific binding site for the purine base analogues while, at the same time, we would be measuring in the b form, the affinity of its secondary binding site (nucleotide site). Despite the fact that caffeine cannot be considered to be a physiological effector for Mytilus glycogen phosphorylase, the kinetic studies of the present communication demonstrate the existence of a functional nucleoside (caffeine) site in Mytilus phosphorylase. Such a site, with inhibitory responses of the enzyme activity, may play an important regulatory physiological role in vim, as a negative heterotropic effector site, especially when we consider the low
