The overexpression or autoactivation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) tyrosine kinase has been associated with various cancers.1 High plasma levels of IGF-1 and low levels of IGF binding protein-3, which controls the amount of free circulating IGF, are directly correlated with an increased risk for developing colon, breast, prostate and lung cancer.2 Several antagonists of the IGF-1 signaling pathway in the form of IGF-1R antibodies and small molecules are currently being investigated in clinical trials.3 Structurally diverse preclinical small molecule inhibitors of IGF-1R have also been reported and hold promise as useful antineoplastic agents.4 During our efforts to generate leads for the inhibition of protein kinases we identified 3,5-disubstituted-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines with the general structure 5 as micromolar inhibitors of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (Scheme 1). Given that our enzymatic assay was comprised of a GST-fused kinase domain of IGF-1R,5 and that the 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine core6 was a known adenine mimic we assumed that the inhibitor's core was binding to the hinge region of the kinase.7

The synthesis of these inhibitors originated with the known versatile 5-bromo-3-iodo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b] pyridine intermediate 1,6 which was initially protected with para-toluenesulfonyl chloride under phase transfer conditions to afford sulfonamide 2. Chemoselective Suzuki coupling of the iodide 2 with 3-aminophenyl boronic acid was possible at 50 °C with dichlorobistriphenylphosphine palladium and 2N aqueous sodium carbonate in a 2:1 mixture of dimethoxyethane and ethanol. This provided aniline 3 which could be functionalized to the urea 4 via addition to various isocyanates. A second Suzuki reaction in a microwave reactor at 120 °C with bromoazaindole 4 was followed by base-mediated hydrolysis of the tosyl group to yield a variety of 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines. Table 1 lists the inhibitory activities against IGF-1R for a preliminary set of compounds from this series. Inhibition near micromolar concentrations was observed with unsubstituted phenyl rings at R1 and R2 (6) as well as with the 200 -fluoro-400 -trifluoromethyl substituted phenyl ring at R2 (7). The latter was subsequently crossed with a range of additionally substituted phenyl rings at R1. While 30 ,40 -dimethoxy substitution at R1 (8) decreased potency, a moderate improvement was made with 30 -fluoro substitution (9). Anilines at the 30 - or 40 -positions (10, 11) improved the enzyme IC50 to more acceptable levels. The homologated congener 40 -benzylamine 12 proved to be 4-fold more potent than the simple aniline 11. The potency imparted by the 40 -benzylamine substituent was also observed with the

300 -chloro phenyl ring at R2 as well (compare 18 to 17). N-Methyl piperidine carboxamides at the 30 - and 40 -positions (13 and 15) had moderate levels of potency. However, the corresponding unconstrained amides 14 and 16 attained sub-100 nM potencies. Having discovered groups at R1 (12, 14, 16), which imparted nanomolar potencies to the chemical series, we further explored the chemical space at R2. In particular, installation of the orthophenoxy substituent in R2 led to the identification of the very potent derivative 19. This substructure, when crossed with other optimal groups at R1, further increased the enzymatic activity to single digit nanomolar potencies as exemplified by compounds 20 and 21. Of particular note was an improvement in kinase selectivity as well. For example, in a preliminary panel of 36 kinases benzyl amine 12 showed >10-fold selectivity against 24 kinases with significant co-activity against IKK1, IKK2, JNK1, JNK3, LYN, and SYK with IC50s measured at 32, 79, 79, 250, 40, and 80 nM respectively. >10-fold selectivity against these six kinases was observed with the related congener 19. The same trend was exhibited by 20 and 21. However the ortho-phenoxy substructure could not achieve selectivity against the closely related insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase. Having discovered the selectivity imparted by the ortho-biphenyl ether for IGF-1R we decided to explore what other groups would be tolerated at R1. At this time we also developed an assay to measure the cellular activity (phospho IGF-1R Cellular IC50 in Tables 2 and 3) of these inhibitors as well.8 With the R2 biphenyl ether held constant, we expanded the SAR around R1. This effort revealed that the above-mentioned enzyme potent derivative 20 was a moderate inhibitor in the cellular assay.9 The unsubstituted phenyl ring (22) also had mediocre cell potency (Table 2). On the other hand, the 30 -dimethyl carboxamide 23 was a potent IGF-1R inhibitor in the enzyme and cellular assay. The cellular potency for the isosteric 30 -dimethyl sulfonamide 24 was reduced by about 17-fold. A similar trend was observed for the same substituents at the 40 -position (compare 25 to 26). Carboxylic acid derivatives, whether directly attached to the phenyl ring at R1 (27) or removed from it (28), had poor cellular activities. Unsubstituted heterocycles at R1, for example, furan 29 or imidazole 30, also affected the cellular potency adversely. All derivatives were essentially equipotent against IR in comparable enzymatic and cellular assays. A co-crystal of IR (insulin receptor) in complex with 19 offered insight into the binding mode of these inhibitors.10 Derived from

this crystal structure, a structural model of IGF-1R in complex with 19 is illustrated in Figure 1. Given that the sequence identity between the kinase domains of IR and IGF-1R is roughly 80%, IR was a reasonable surrogate for IGF-1R, and we concluded that the binding mode of these inhibitors would be nearly identical within the ATP-binding site of both kinases. A frontal view of the IGF-1R ATP-binding site (Fig. 1A) clearly shows that the 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine core forms two H-bond interactions at the hinge region, one with the backbone carbonyl of Glu1050 and the second

with the backbone amino group of Met1052. The C3 phenyl at the 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine core lies at the inner hydrophobic region where it interacts with Val983, Lys1003, Met1049, Met1112, and Phe1124.11 Near the DFG motif, the urea lies just past the activation loop, where the urea hydrogens interact with one of the carboxylate oxygens of Glu1020 (Fig. 1B). This, interaction directs the biphenyl ether deeper into the back-pocket region, where it lies below the aC-helix in contact with Val1023, Met1024, Phe1027, Val1032, Leu1096, Phe1101, His1103, and Ile1121 (Fig. 1B).

The additional hydrophobic contacts created by the biphenyl ether derivatives over those with a single phenyl may account in part for the greater potency seen with the former over the latter. Also, such a deep back-pocket binding mode may account for the IGF-1R selectivity associated with the biphenyl ether derivatives. Finally, the C5 phenyl (R1) occupies the outer hydrophobic region with the ionizable primary amine exposed to solvent. At this position, the presence of water solubilizing groups is well tolerated. With an understanding of the binding mode of the biphenyl ether we decided to elaborate on the SAR around this substructure (Table 3). The C5 30 -dimethyl benzamide substituent was chosen for comparison as it was found to impart high potency in our cellular assay (e.g., 23, Table 2).12 The biphenyl aniline isostere 31 lost about 6-fold cellular potency compared to 23, while maintaining enzyme activity. The homologated 200 -benzyl ether 32 and the directly attached 200 -biphenyl derivative 33 had reduced activity in both enzyme and cellular assays. The movement of the phenoxy

group to meta (34) or para (35) positions also led to significant losses of potency with respect to 23. This work implied that the conformation adapted by the 200 -phenoxy phenyl group at R2 was optimal in making the appropriate contacts with the hydrophobic residues at the back pocket of the enzyme, as minor deviations away from the structure reduced the effectiveness of this binding mode. In summary, SAR exploration around the 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine core led to the discovery of potent inhibitors of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase. These compounds bind to the enzyme such that the 200 -phenoxy ether accesses a unique back pocket in the enzyme. Subtle changes to this pharmacophore led to loss of activity underscoring its unique nature. Additional development within this series of compounds will be discussed in future communications.

NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing human IGF-1R were plated in 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well) in culture media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37° C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Twenty four hours post-plating, cells were treated with different concentrations of test compounds ranging from 30 lM to 1.5 nM. Two hours after compound addition, cells were stimulated with human IGF-1 (30 ng/ml). Cell lysates were analyzed for phosphorylated receptors using dissociation enhanced lanthanide fluorimmuno assay (DELFIA) with anti-IGF-1R (MAB391, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) capture antibody and europium-labeled anti-pTyr antibody (Eu-N1 PT66, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) for detection. The fluorescence signal for cells treated with compounds was expressed as percent relative to 100% stimulation (IGF-1 stimulated signal). Concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation (IC50) was determined by 4 parameter fit of data using XLfit (value of no cell control was subtracted from all samples for background). The cellular potencies of 19 and 21, reported in Table 1, were not determined. IR protein was expressed and purified as previously described in Hubbard, S. R. et al. Nature, 1994, 372, 746. Protein at 10 mg s/ml was complexed with a 3fold molar excess of inhibitor for 1 h prior to crystallization. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 22° from 0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.0, 1.0 M trisodium citrate. Crystals were flash frozen in PFO prior to data collection. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PDB:1IRK as a starting model and refined to an Rfactor of 20% at 2.6 Å using REFMAC. Crystallographic data for the structure in Figure 1 have been deposited at PDB:3ETA. For kinase ATP binding pocket nomenclature, see: Vulpetti, A.; Bosotti, R. Il Farmaco 2004, 59, 759. Compound 23 inhibited cellular proliferation in a COLO205 cell line with EC50 at 274 nM (average of 4 measurements).

GST-rTEV-IGF-1R(957-1367) containing amino acid residues 957­1367 was purified from a baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells using Glutathione Sepharose 4FF column chromatography followed by Sephadex-200 size exclusion column chromatography. Assays were performed in 384-well (Greiner, Catalog No. 784076) microtiter plates. Reaction buffer (50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5; 10 mM MgCl2; 3 mM DTT; 1 mM CHAPS; 0.1 mg/ ml BSA) for peptide phosphorylation (10 ll volume) contained, in final concentrations, 500 nM biotinylated peptide substrate; 10 lM ATP; and purified, activated hIGF-1R (0.5 nM). Activation of GST-rTEV-IGF-1R(9571367) was achieved by a 4-min incubation of hIGF-1R (2.7 lM final) with 2 mM ATP in 50 mM Hepes, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, at room temperature. Compounds, titrated in DMSO, were evaluated at eleven concentrations ranging from 50 lM to 0.2 nM. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and were stopped by a 5-ll addition of EDTA (to 33 mM). A further addition of 5 ll detection reagents (for final 7 nM Streptavidin­APC (Perkin-Elmer #CR130-150), 1 nM Europium-labeled antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Perkin-Elmer #AD0067), added in reaction buffer (without DTT), was required for signal generation.
