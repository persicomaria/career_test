The conclusion of this NMR study ww that maltodcstrins longer than m&osc could bind to MBP in two ditkrcnt fitshions: cithcr with the multodostrin reducing end in the MBP binding pocket or with the middle glucose rwiduc(s) ocwpying this site. The balance hctween thcsc two bindins modes was seen to depend on the length of the maltodcstrin and on the configuratiou of the reducing end (a or /?I. While intermediate length
