A Reexamination of the Substrate Utilization of 2-Thioorotidine5 -monophosphate by Yeast Orotidine-5 -Monophosphate Decarboxylase
Jeffrey A. Smiley,*,1 Kelly M. Hay, and Bruce S. Levison
*Department of Chemistry and Department of Biological Sciences, and the Center for Biomedical and Environmental Research, Youngstown State University, Youngstown, Ohio 44555 Received October 6, 2000 A potential alternate substrate for orotidine-5 -monophosphate decarboxylase, 2- thio-orotidine-5 -monophosphate, was synthesized enzymatically and purified by a modification of a previous account (K. Shostak, and M. E. Jones 1992, Biochemistry 31, 12155­12161). Characterization of the product was confirmed by mass spectrometry, 31P NMR, and utilization by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase in the direction of pyrophosphorolysis. The previous work probably did not result in the purification of the desired compound, as evidenced by our observation of 2-thioOMP's sensitivity to high temperature, as used previously. Using a very sensitive HPLC assay for the potential decarboxylated product 2-thioUMP, no measurable activity of ODCase toward the alternate substrate was observed, representing a decarboxylation rate decreased by 10 7 from the kcat for ODCase toward OMP. Additionally, 2-thioOMP effects no inhibition of ODCase decarboxylation of OMP at a concentration of 50 M, indicating a poor ability to bind to the ODCase active site. The results bear implications for proposed mechanisms for catalysis by ODCase. 2001 Academic Press

Recent protein crystal structures (1­4) have provided new insights into the catalytic mechanism of OMP decarboxylase (ODCase),2 the enzyme with the highest measured catalytic proficiency (5). Originally, the catalytic mechanism of ODCase was presumed to proceed through a protonation step at O2 preceding decarboxylation (Fig. 1), yielding a zwitterionic intermediate, based on the observation of rates of uncatalyzed decarboxylation of model compounds (6). Support for this mechanism arose from enzyme inhibition (7) and isotope effect studies (8­10). A lysine residue (Lys93 of the yeast enzyme), common to all protein sequences of ODCases from many organisms, was found to be critical for catalysis and postulated as the general acid group

protonating the substrate (11). Substitution of sulfur for oxygen at the 2-carbonyl position apparently resulted in a substrate analog, 2-thioorotidine-5 -monophosphate (2-thioOMP), that was incapable of undergoing catalysis (12). The four crystal structures (1­4) showed an orientation for the inhibitors with C6, rather than C2, aligned with the invariant lysine residue. A mechanism proposed from this active-site structure (1,3,4) suggests that this lysine side chain donates a proton to C6 of OMP to directly replace the departing carboxylate (Fig. 2), invoking no critical involvement of the substituent at C2. In light of the new mechanism proposed, and to extend our previous finding that 2-thioUMP has essentially the same inhibition constant as UMP (13), a reexamination of the substrate utilization of 2-thioOMP seemed warranted. Possibly, the enzymatic synthesis method used previously (12) yielded a compound other than the anticipated product 2-thioOMP. We have synthesized 2-thioOMP from 2-thioorotate, 5-phosphorylribose-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase), and devised an HPLC assay for detection of 2-thioUMP which could be generated from the decarboxylation by ODCase. We have found 2-thioOMP to be a fairly unstable compound and suspect that the compound isolated previously (12) was likely an undesired product of this instability. However, the 2-thioOMP we have synthesized and characterized does not undergo enzymatic decarboxylation and does not bind to ODCase with an affinity even remotely similar to that for OMP, calling again into question the role of the 2-carbonyl group of the substrate during catalysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 2-Thioorotate, previously purchased from Aldrich (12), is not currently commercially available, and was instead synthesized from thiourea (Sigma) and oxaloacetate monoethyl ester (from the diethyl ester, Sigma) according to a previous account (14). OPRTase was a generous provision from the laboratory of Dr. Charles Grubmeyer, Temple University. 2-Thiouracil and PRPP were from Sigma. OMP and [carboxyl14 C]OMP were synthesized according to the modified procedure (9) of the original synthesis (15). Yeast ODCase was isolated as the predominant protein eluting from a column of Affi-Gel Blue affinity chromatography resin, as described previously (16). 2-thioOMP was enzymatically synthesized as described previously (12), with the following modifications. Instead of terminating the reaction by boiling, the reaction was quenched by the addition of ethanol to a final concentration of 50%, and precipitated protein was removed by filtration. The solution was evaporated to a small volume, and the products were separated by anion-exchange HPLC, using a Hamilton PRP-X100 column (305 7 mm) and the following elution profile, 0­10 min, 0­0.8 M NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, linear gradient; 10­25 min, isocratic 0.8 M NH4HCO3, pH 8.4. Products eluting from the column were detected by absorbance at 270 or 276 nm. 2-thioOMP was quantitated by absorbance at 276 nm, according to the extinction coefficient ( 276 11,000 M 1) obtainable from the isosbestic point in the conversion of 2-thioorotate to 2-thioOMP demonstrated previously (12).

fractions of 2-thioOMP was assayed using Nessler's reagent, with NH4HCO3 solution as a standard. 2-thioUMP was enzymatically synthesized as before (13), using overproduced uracil phosphoribosyltransferase from an Escherichia coli strain kindly provided by Dr. Jan Neuhard, University of Copenhagen. 2-thioUMP was purified under the same HPLC conditions as above. Mass spectrometry of 2-thioOMP. An HPLC elution fraction corresponding to a major peak arising in the 2-thioOMP enzymatic synthesis was subjected to analysis on a Bruker Esquire mass spectrometer, under the following electrospray ionization (ESI) conditions: ESI voltage, 4.0 kV; direct infusion; capillary temperature, 300 C; anion detection; scan range, 50­2200 m/z; scan resolution, 0.6 m/z. NMR analysis of 2-thioorotate and 2-thioOMP. Synthesized 2-thioorotate was analyzed by 13C NMR (proton decoupled), and 2-thioOMP analyzed by 31P NMR, using a Varian Gemini 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Samples of both compounds were prepared in D2O, with NaOD added to the 2-thioorotate to increase solubility. OPRTase-catalyzed pyrophosphorolysis of 2-thioOMP. Further structural analysis of the suspected 2-thioOMP was assessed using the HPLC-purified material as a substrate for the pyrophosphorolysis reaction catalyzed by OPRTase. Reaction conditions were identical to the OPRTase reaction for 2-thioOMP synthesis, with the exception of 40 M 2-thioOMP and 200 M sodium pyrophosphate replacing 2thioorotate and PRPP as substrates, and the exclusion of inorganic pyrophosphatase. Products were separated under the same HPLC conditions as used for the purification of 2-thioOMP. Enzymatic assays of ODCase using OMP and 2-thioOMP. ODCase activity at saturating OMP concentration (50 M) was measured using a spectrophotometric 2250 M 1. Decarboxylation activity was measured in the assay (17) with 286 presence of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. For reactions containing 200 mM NH4HCO3, a solution of 1 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.9, was added to give a final concentration of 50 mM Tris and a final pH of 8.0. Activity was measured within the first minute of initiating the reaction. Activities at subsaturating concentrations were measured using the 14C displacement assay with [carboxyl-14C]OMP (18). Activity of ODCase toward 2-thioOMP was measured by detection of 2-thioUMP by HPLC, with the measured retention times for 2-thioOMP (10 min) and 2-thioUMP (6.8­6.9 min) under the separation conditions described above. 2-thioUMP was quanti13,000 M 1. The concentration of 2-thioOMP was 50 M, and tated using 274 the ODCase concentration was increased to as high as 220 g mL 1. Tris-Cl was added to a final concentration of 50 mM, pH 8.0, and NH4HCO3 (from 2-thioOMP HPLC fractions) was 200 mM. From 1.0-mL reactions, 100- L samples were taken for HPLC analysis. In some samples, 2-thioUMP was included as a standard. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Shostak and Jones (12) showed that the activity of OPRTase toward 2-thioorotate and PRPP was consistent with formation of a nucleotide closely resembling OMP, from the UV absorbance spectra of the enzymatic reaction. The OPRTase used in this enzymatic synthesis has a high specificity for orotate versus other heterocycles, due to hydrogen bonding of N3­O4 and the carboxylate of the natural substrate (19); these strucural features of the pyrimidine substrate are unchanged in the thio analog.

SMILEY, HAY, AND LEVISON

The lack of activity of OPRTase toward 5-carboxyuracil (C. Grubmeyer, personal communication), for example, indicates that the exact location of the carboxylate group on the pyrimidine is critical for binding and catalysis, and formation of the expected 2-thioOMP by this enzyme is quite predictable. Our enzymatic synthesis of 2-thioOMP produced a major peak in the HPLC profile emerging at 10 min,well before the elution of 2-thioorotate. This peak increased in intensity with length of time of the reaction and presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase to remove pyrophosphate (Fig. 3). The previous description of the enzymatic synthesis of 2-thioOMP (12) reported that the nucleotide emerged from anion-exchange HPLC after the starting compound. We thus subjected our product to further analysis. 13 C NMR analysis of 2-thioorotate showed peaks with the following chemical shifts and their tentative assignments: 181.7 ppm (C2), 176.2 ppm (C7), 174.9 ppm (C4), 161.1 ppm (C6), 104.0 ppm (C5). The pattern is similar to, but distinct from, the 13C signals from orotate, and no discernable traces of orotate signals in this preparation were evident. Mass spectrometry of the 10-min fraction revealed the following anionic masses: 339.0, 360.9, 383.0, and 405.0 (Fig. 4). The mass of 383.0 matches that for the monoanion of 2-thioOMP. The mass of 405.0 matches that for the monoanion of 2thioOMP in which Na+ has replaced one dissociable proton. The two lower masses are in agreement with the monoanion and Na+-substituted monoanion of 2-thioUMP, suggesting decarboxylation within the conditions of the mass spectrometer. Analysis

The fractions from the peaks at 10 min were collected and analyzed. The peaks in B­D at 13 min arise in control reactions without OPRTase (data not shown), and are presumed to be indicative of a contaminant in the PRPP.

of OMP, synthesized separately, gave major peaks of 367.10 and 323.38 (Fig. 4), again suggesting decarboxylation within the conditions of the mass spectrometer. 31 P NMR of 2-thioOMP gave a single signal of 3.2 ppm (phosphate reference standard set at 0.0 ppm), resembling the value of 3 ppm (relative to phosphate) reported for OMP (20). The single 31P NMR signal indicates only one nucleotide present, with no isomerization or other undesired side reaction evident. The isolated nucleotide was completely converted to 2-thioorotate in the OPRTasecatalyzed pyrophosphorolysis reaction. The OPRTase pyrophosphorolysis reaction resulted in the complete disappearance of the 10 min HPLC peak, and formation of a 2-thioorotate peak at 22 min (Fig. 5). From the increased production of the HPLC

fraction upon enhancing the OPRTase synthesis reaction conditions, mass spectrometric analysis, 31P NMR analysis, and the ability of the isolated compound to act as an OPRTase pyrophosphorolysis substrate, we conclude that the 10-min fraction from HPLC purification does in fact contain 2-thioOMP, and that no unwanted side reactions occur in our preparation. The conflict with the relative retention times of 2-thioorotate and 2-thioOMP in our study and the previous report (12) remained to be resolved. We observed retention times for 2-thiouracil and 2-thioUMP of 17.5 and 6.8­6.9 min, respectively, and assumed that similar but longer retention times would be found for 2-thioorotate and 2-thioOMP. The longer retention times for pyrimidine bases, compared to their respective nucleotides, on anion-exchange HPLC under these conditions are likely a function of the increased hydrophobic interactions of the bases with the matrix of the anion-exchange resin. We also observed that prolonged evaporation of the 2thioOMP solution, to remove NH4HCO3, resulted in new peaks with longer retention times upon HPLC analysis of the evaporated material. Suspecting chemical instability of the 2-thioOMP, we subjected a sample of purified nucleotide to a boiling water bath for 3 min, speculating on the unspecified conditions for terminating the OPRTase

reaction in the previous report. HPLC analysis of the heat-treated sample showed two peaks with longer retention times, indicating conversion of some of the 2-thioOMP to uncharacterized products (data not shown). We suspect that one of these products was isolated in the previous study. Due to the observed instability of 2-thioOMP to evaporation for removal of NH4HCO3, we evaluated the activity of ODCase toward this potential alternate substrate in the presence of NH4HCO3 that eluted with the 2-thioOMP, and compared the results to ODCase activity toward OMP in the presence of the same amount of NH4HCO3. In the spectrophotometric assay of ODCase activity toward OMP (at saturating OMP concentration), activity in 200 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, is modestly reduced to about 80% of its maximal activity in the absence of NH4HCO3. The HPLC assay of ODCase activity was sufficiently sensitive to detect traces of UMP (retention time 6.3­6.5 min) and 6-azaUMP (retention time 7.6­7.7 min) present in the ODCase preparation, that had not been removed by dialysis during enzyme purification. The measured amounts of these nucleotides that were present in the assay of activity toward 2-thioOMP were well below their respective Ki values (7) and thus effected only a negligible degree of inhibition. The peaks for UMP and 6-azaUMP afforded convenient markers for the detection of 2-thioUMP that could potentially be produced from ODCase and 2-thioOMP. Assays of ODCase activity toward 2-thioOMP showed that this substrate analog is at best an extremely poor substrate. In 1.0-ml assays with 220 g ODCase and 50 M 2-thioOMP, the 2-thioOMP HPLC peak remained unchanged and no 2-thioUMP was detectable after 120 min. Using synthesized 2-thioUMP as a standard in a control HPLC analysis, the amount of 2-thioUMP produced under this reaction condition,

possibly undetectable in the baseline noise, is estimated to be less than 0.10 nmol (Fig. 6). The amount of conversion of 2-thioOMP to 2-thioUMP in this assay was thus less than 3.8 10 6 nmol min 1 g 1, decreased from the kcat of ODCase toward OMP (16) by a factor of 10 7. Contrary to the previous report (12), 2-thioOMP exerts no inhibition of ODCase activity toward OMP at concentrations in the range of Km for OMP. Assays of ODCase activity with and without 50 M 2-thioOMP are essentially identical (Fig. 7); thus the Ki for this substrate analog is well over 100 M. By contrast, the Km for OMP in optimal conditions is 0.7 M; under the conditions of high NH4HCO3 concentration, the Km is raised to approximately 4 M. The striking result from thio-substitution studies is that OMP binding to the ODCase active site is essentially eliminated by 2-thio substitution, whereas UMP binding to the same active site is hardly affected by 2-thio substitution (13). In the four published crystal structures (1­4), there appears to be little steric constraint at O2 of each bound ligand, including O2 of UMP complexed to the Bacillus subtilis enzyme (1). Additionally, Miller et al. (21) have shown that removal of the Gln215 side chain, the only active-site functional group within proximity of O2 of the bound ligand, is inconsequential for decarboxylase activity. It is predictable from these observations that 2-thioUMP would have approximately the same affinity as UMP, as there appears ° to be ample accommodation for the larger C S group, which is typically 0.4 A longer than a C O double bond (22). It is not evident, however, why 2-thioOMP does not bind and undergo decarboxylation if it occupies the same orientation as UMP as seen in the crystal structures, and that projected for OMP by the mechanism in Fig. 2. OMP apparently binds to the ODCase active site in an orientation that does not tolerate 2-thio-substitution, but UMP binds in an orientation that is indifferent to 2thio-substitution. A plausible explanation for this observation is that OMP binding to ODCase is fundamentally different from UMP binding (when UMP is added to the active site as a ligand as opposed to produced by decarboxylation). Possibly, OMP

binds at the active site in an orientation with the pyrimidine ring rotated 180 about the glycosidic bond with respect to the inhibitors seen in the crystal structures (compare Fig. 1A with Fig. 2C). The near symmetry of the pyrimidine rings of ODCase ligands, especially 6-hydroxyuridine-5 monophosphate (BMP), has previously prompted speculation on the orientation of inhibitor and substrate binding (2,4,7,11). Binding of a nearly symmetrical heterocyclic substrate analog in an orientation reversed from that of the substrate has precedent in the binding of the pteridine ring of methotrexate to dihydrofolate reductase (23). From the crystal structures of ODCase in complex with inhibitors, an orientation of OMP with the pyrimidine ring rotated 180 about the glycosidic bond (with respect to the binding of inhibitors) would align O2 for protonation by Lys93, in accordance with the original mechanism. If OMP binds with O2 oriented toward the active-site lysine (Fig. 1), the steric constraints might be prohibitive for 2-thioOMP binding and catalysis, in accord with the observations herein. The yeast enzyme (2) and the Escherichia coli enzyme (4) ° each show a 2.7 A distance between the terminal N of the active-site lysine and O6 of BMP (analogous to O2 of OMP in a 180 -rotated conformation). The enzyme's attempt to bind 2-thioOMP, using the mechanism in Fig. 1, would be affected by a ° decrease in this distance of 0.4 A compared to OMP, and this effect might well account for the lack of binding and decarboxylation of 2-thioOMP. Certainly, the role of O2 in OMP decarboxylation is different from that of O4, which can tolerate thiosubstitution (24). It is intriguing to note that binding of OMP with the pyrimidine ring rotated 180 with respect to the binding of the inhibitors in the crystal structures would result in proximity of the carboxylate with the 5 -phosphate of the substrate (depicted in Fig. 1). The role of decarboxylases is, of course, to promote electron flow off of the carboxylate and onto the remainder of the substrate, which presumably is stabilized by other molecular features of the active site. This role appears to be fulfilled in part by an active-site glutamate side chain in histidine decarboxylase (25). An anionic phosphate, in this case part of the substrate rather than part of the enzyme, would be perfectly suited for this task as well. This possible mechanistic feature is supported by the observation of profound decreases in ODCase activity toward orotate and orotidine (26, 27). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
