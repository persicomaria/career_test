Abstract The Salmonella typhimurium class B nonspecific acid phosphatase (AphA protein) belongs to the L2-haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. The conserved Lys-154 interacts with substrate phosphate, nucleophile Asp-46, and Asp-173 in the wild-type AphA protein. Asp-173 also interacts with Mg(II) water ligand and with main-chain amide of loop-4. We report here the mutational analysis of Lys-154 and Asp-173, the crystal structures of the K154N and K154R mutants, and the results of electrostatic potential calculations. The K154N, K154R and D173N mutants display significant reduction in the phosphatase activity. Lys-154 may not be responsible for a juxtaposition of the substrate phosphate and the aspartyl nucleophile, but has an hitherto unknown functional role of rendering the substrate phosphorous atom electron deficient. Nearly 10,000-fold increase in the Kd value for dissociation of the cofactor Mg(II) observed for the D173N mutant correlates well with theoretically estimated change in the binding free energy of Mg(II).

The L-2 haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) proteins are ubiquitous in nature with several thousand members identified in genome databases (Pfam Accession No. PF00702). The majority of the enzymes of the HAD superfamily are found to be phosphatases, ATPases and phosphomutases [1]. The HAD proteins are associated with membrane transport, metabolism, signal transduction, nucleic acid repair, and also act as transcription cofactors and regulator of actin dynamics. A virulence related role of the HAD phosphatase, SerB653, of Porphyromonas gingivalis has been suggested for an invasion of periodontal pathogen recently

q The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the K154N and K154R mutants of AphA have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the Accession Codes 2AUT and 1Z88, respectively. * Corresponding author.

[2]. Understanding the details of the reaction catalyzed by the HAD proteins is thus of considerable importance. The class B nonspecific acid phosphatase (AphA protein) of Salmonella typhimurium (Swiss-Prot Accession No. Q5MB24) belongs to the HAD superfamily and shares four conserved sequence motifs with other HAD phosphotransferases. The crystal structures of many HAD proteins, including those of the AphA protein from Escherichia coli [3,4] and S. typhimurium (PDB Code 1Z5G), are known. All the HAD proteins contain a highly conserved a/b core domain. The residues of the conserved motifs reside on four structurally distinct loops (loops 1­4) which together form the active-site scaffold [5]. For instance, the active-site of S. typhimurium AphA monomer is constituted by loop-1 Asp-46 and Asp-48 residues, loop-2 Thr-114 and Gly-115 residues, loop-3 Lys-154, and loop-4 Asp-169 and Asp-173 residues (Fig. 1). The cofactor Mg(II) is essential for the biochemical activity of the HAD phosphotransferases [6]. In the S. typhimurium AphA monomer, the side chain carboxylate

mutants. We show for the first time that the side chain NHþ group of Lys-154 primarily renders the phosphorous 3 center electron deficient which facilitates the nucleophilic attack, that the negative charge of Asp-173 contributes significantly towards higher binding affinity of the cofactor Mg(II), and that Asp-173 influences the reaction chemistry through its interactions with Lys-154 and with main-chain amide of the loop-4. A striking structural homology among the phosphotransferases of HAD proteins suggests that the results of the present study will provide insights into the reaction mechanisms of other HAD phosphotransferases.

of Asp-46 and Asp-169, main chain carbonyl of Asp-48, and three water molecules complete the octahedral coordination of Mg(II). The majority of the HAD proteins also contain a cap domain, which could determine the substrate specificity [6]. The AphA protein contains a rigid bihelical cap domain [4,5]. The cap domain of S. typhimurium AphA consists of residues 54­90. This protein exhibits a homotetrameric quaternary structure with monomers arranged in 222 point symmetry [3], such that solvent accessibility of each active-site is not reduced by other monomers of the tetramer. The HAD phosphotransferases are believed to share a common reaction mechanism [6]. In S. typhimurium AphA, Asp-46 acts as a nucleophile and attacks the phosphorous center of the substrate phosphate, leading to the formation of a phosphoaspartate­enzyme intermediate [7]. The leaving organic group is stabilized by the donation of a proton from Asp-48 that acts as a general acid during the first step of catalysis and as a base in the second step activates the water or an alcohol that results in aspartylphosphate hydrolysis. The only conserved active-site Lys/Arg (corresponding to Lys-154 of S. typhimurium AphA) in the known phosphate-bound structures of the HAD phosphotransferases interacts with the substrate phosphoryl group, the Asp nucleophile and a carboxylate group that assists in the binding of the cofactor Mg(II) ion. The carboxylate group corresponds to Asp-173 of S. typhimurium AphA which resides on loop-4 that shows maximum divergence in sequences and structures of the HAD phosphotransferases. The focus of the present study is to elucidate the functional roles of active-site Lys-154 and Asp-173 residues of the S. typhimurium AphA protein. We report a mutational analysis of Lys-154 and Asp173 of the S. typhimurium AphA protein, the crystal structures of the K154N and K154R mutants of AphA, and the results of electrostatic calculations carried out using the atomic coordinates of the wild-type AphA and its

Site-directed mutagenesis, over-expression and purification of the mutants
All basic recombinant DNA procedures were performed as described by Sambrook and Russell [8]. E. coli XL1 Blue was used as the initial cloning host and BL21(DE3) for expression of the genes. TAAGGGAAACA TATGAAAAAAATAACCCTG and GCTCTCCTGGATCCTAGTACT C CGAG were used as the forward and reverse primers to amplify the orf of aphA gene from genomic DNA of our laboratory strain of S. typhimurium [9] using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase. The PCR product was subsequently cloned into NdeI and BamHI site of pET21a(+). The pET21a-aphA wildtype construct was used as the template to carry out the site-directed mutagenesis of aphA employing the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The complementary primer pairs used for aphA mutagenesis were as follows: K154R (left, CAAAATACGAGAGTACAGTGG; right, CCA CTGTACTCTCGTATTTTG), K154N (left, GGAACAAAA TACGAA TGTACAGTGGCTG; right, CAGCCACTGTACATTCG TATTTTG TTCC), and D173N (left, GATTCGGATAACAATATTA CCGCGG; right CCGCGGTAATATTGTTATCCGAATC), where the bold letters in the left primer sequences depict the mutated codons. The aphA orfs in the recombinant plasmid mutants were sequenced completely, using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI-PRISM 377) for the confirmation of targeted mutations. The wild-type and mutant plasmids were subsequently transformed into the expression host individually for the overproduction of proteins. The proteins were purified to homogeneity as described previously [9], and their identities were confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and molecular weight determination by MALDI-TOF.

410 nm (De = 17,400 MÀ1 cmÀ1) at 37 °C in the standard assay buffer (100 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.6 containing 1 mM magnesium chloride). Steady-state kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined from the initial velocity (V0) data obtained over a range of pNPP concentrations (0.1­10Km). The V0 data were plotted as a function of substrate concentrations using Microcalä Origin software. The values for Km and Vmax were derived using non-linear curve fitting with primary Michaelis­Menten equation. The turnover number (kcat) was calculated from Vmax using the relation kcat = Vmax/[E], where the enzyme concentration [E] was determined by modified Lowry's method using bovine serum albumin as the standard [10].

Mg(II) activation
Metal-free wild-type AphA and D173N mutant proteins were prepared by dialyzing these proteins against buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.6) and 20 mM EDTA. EDTA was subsequently removed from the metal-free proteins by dialyzing these against buffer comprising 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.6 at 4 °C. This procedure is similar to that followed for Mg(II) activation of phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase [11]. The dissociation constant (Kd) for Mg(II) binding with the metal-free enzymes was determined from the initial velocity data obtained over a range of Mg(II) concentration in the 1 mL reaction mixture comprising 100 mM of sodium acetate buffer pH 5.6 and saturating concentration (10 mM) of pNPP. The following relation was used to estimate the Kd value of the Mg(II)­enzyme complex Vo ¼ V max ½MgðIIÞ K d þ ½MgðIIÞ ð1Þ

where Vo is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity and [Mg(II)] is the Mg(II) ion concentration. The values for Kd and Vmax were derived using non-linear curve fitting. To test if Mg(II) binds loosely, the wild-type AphA and D173N mutant proteins were saturated with Mg(II). These were subsequently dialyzed in the absence of EDTA against two changes of 1 L buffer comprising 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.6 at 4 °C, and the phosphatase activity was assayed.

Crystallization and data collection
The purified K154R and K154N mutant proteins were equilibrated against 25 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.6) and were concentrated to 6 mg/mL using centricon-30 (Millipore). Protein crystals were grown by the combination of vapor-diffusion hanging-drop and macro-seeding methods using the crystallization condition (10% PEG 6000, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 5% glycerol and 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.7), as reported previously for the wild-type AphA [9]. Before data collection, crystals of both the mutant proteins were maintained for 24 h in crystallization condition containing 50 mM sodium phosphate. The diffraction intensity data for the K154R and K154N mutant crystals were acquired on Mar345 imaging plate systems using Cu Ka radiation from a laboratory X-ray source. The intensity data were integrated using MOSFLM [12] and scaled, merged and truncated using SCALA [13] and TRUNCATE from CCP4. The crystals of the mutant proteins were orthorhombic, belonging to space group P212121, and were isomorphous to the crystals of wild-type AphA with the following unit cell ° dimensions: a = 70.74, b = 84.48, c = 149.27 A for the K154N mutant, ° and a = 70.65, b = 84.21, c = 149.41 A for the K154R mutant. Corre° sponding to the VM and solvent content of 2.33 A DaÀ1 and $47% respectively, the unit cell dimensions are consistent with the presence of four monomers (A­D) in the asymmetric unit for the mutant proteins. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1.

code 1Z5G) after omitting the side chain atoms of Lys-154, the solvent molecules, the Mg(II) ions and the phosphate from the coordinates list (truncated model). The 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps, computed with phases from the truncated model, revealed unambiguously electron density for side chain atoms of the substituted amino acids at position 154 and for the cofactor Mg(II) ion. The atomic structures for the K154N and K154R mutants were built into the electron density. Refinement of the mutant structures was carried using CNS [14] with bulk solvent correction and intermittent model editing using the O suite [15]. The solvents were identified from the electron density maps after the refinement of the models to a crystallographic R-factor of $0.25. Importantly, a water molecule (W3) was observed to occupy the site of the side chain NHþ 3 group of Lys-154 of wild-type AphA in both the mutant structures. Also, a phosphate anion and a Na(I) cation were fitted into unaccounted electron density, observed consistently at 6r levels, in the active-site of the D subunit of the K154N mutant. The refined structural models of both the mutant proteins have R-factors below 17% against all the observed data with F/r(F) P 0. Evaluation using PROCHECK [16] revealed good stereochemistry of the structures, with nearly 92% residues in the core region of the Ramachandran plot and no disallowed (/, w) combinations. The electron density is well defined everywhere except for the five N-terminal residues and the atomic coordinates for these were not included in the refined models. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Electrostatic potential calculations
The atomic model for the D173N mutant was constructed by replacing the side chain atoms of Asp-173 of a wild-type AphA monomer with those for an asparagine residue. Two rotamers of Asn with side chain conformations similar to that of Asp-173 in the wild-type AphA, but differing from each other by an 180° rotation about the Cb ­Cc bond, were used as models of the D173N mutant monomer. The atomic

Hydrogen atoms were added to the structural models with Chimera suite [17]. The CHARMM22 parameter set [18] was used to specify charges and atomic radii, with all atoms carrying partial charges. Continuum electrostatic calculations were carried out with the ° program DelPhi (version 4; [19]) on a 0.5 · 0.5 · 0.5 A cubic grid, with 80% fill dipolar boundary conditions. Other parameters were set as follows: salt concentration 0.1 mM, protein dielectric constant e(p) = 2, and solvent dielectric constant e(s) = 78. The electrostatic energy of binding was estimated at the Mg(II) binding site for each of the structural models. The change in dissociation constant was estimated using the relation K mut =K wt ¼ expðDDGmutÀwt =RT Þ, where DDGmutÀwt is the change d d in binding free energies of the mutant and wild-type proteins and is estimated from the change in the electrostatic binding energy assuming all other energy terms are the same. Using the same set of DelPhi parameters, electrostatic potentials were estimated at the substrate phosphate atoms and at the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the nucleophile Asp-46 to elucidate the roles of Lys-154 and Asp-173. The electrostatic calculations were carried out using CHARMM22 parameter set for the refined coordinates of the monomers of the wild-type AphA and the K154N and K154R mutants, and for the modeled structure of the D173N mutant. The CHARMM27 parameter [20] set was employed for assigning charges on dianionic methylphosphate atoms, which was modeled as a mimic of the substrate on the basis of the observed phosphate-binding sites in wild-type AphA and K154N mutant. The cofactor magnesium ion carrying +2 point charge, water ligands of Mg(II) and W3 water molecule were included in the calculations. All the other water molecules were removed from the coordinates lists. The electrostatic potentials at the atomic sites were estimated by summing over all the potentials computed for the charge on each grid point, such that the estimated potentials include not only the potentials induced by all other charges but also the self-potentials. The results are summarized in Table 2.

the wild-type AphA protein with the estimated Kd of approximately 0.07 lM. The kinetic data thus indicate an increase of nearly 10000-fold in the Kd value for dissociation of Mg(II) in the D173N mutant as compared to wild-type AphA. Further, the Mg(II) saturated D173N mutant protein loses phosphatase activity when dialyzed against the buffer in absence of EDTA, as compared to wild-type AphA, suggesting that Mg(II) is loosely bound in the active-site of the D173N mutant. In the presence of 1 mM Mg(II) the phosphatase activity of the D173N mutant is partially restored, with nearly 5-fold reduction in kcat and 18-fold increase in Km for pNPP substrate as compared to wild-type AphA (Table 3). Increasing the Mg(II) ion concentration from 1 mM to 10 mM (10 times the estimated Kd) in the reaction milieu results in a stronger binding of the substrate pNPP as suggested by the decrease in the Km value, but without significant enhancement in the turnover number (Table 3). The activity of the D173N mutant thus does not equal that of wild-type AphA even when the former is saturated with the cofactor cation, which suggests that Asp-173 may have an additional role in the catalysis. The K154N and K154R mutants of AphA display poor phosphatase efficiency compared to wild-type AphA (Table 3). The catalytic efficiency of the mutants is not affected by the presence of varying concentrations of Mg(II) in the reaction buffer (data not shown). The substitution of Lys154 by Asn results in a nearly 6-fold increase in Km and 40-fold reduction in kcat. Even with a conservative change

Results Catalytic activities of the mutants The substitution of Asp-173 with Asn severely affects the binding of the cofactor Mg(II). The metal-free D173N mutant did not show any detectable phosphatase activity in the absence of Mg(II) in the reaction buffer. The Kd for Mg(II) binding in the D173N mutant is estimated to be 0.9 ± 0.08 mM. Even in the absence of added Mg(II) in the assay buffer, the metal-free wild-type AphA showed $40% activity compared to the holo enzyme, probably because in the former case the protein had picked the metal ions from the dialysis buffers.

of Arg substituting for Lys-154, the K154R mutant displays increase in the Km value by a factor of two and nearly 20-fold reduction in kcat. The kinetic data thus suggest a critical role for the side chain NHþ group of Lys-154. 3 The crystal structures of these mutants provide a clear rationale for the observed activity loss of the mutants and are discussed in the next section. Comparison of the structures of the wild-type and the K154N and K154R mutants of AphA The overall structure of the mutants is essentially the same as that of wild-type AphA: rms difference for the 835 Ca atoms of wild-type AphA tetramer is nearly ° ° 0.12 A and 0.14 A against K154N and K154R mutants, respectively (Fig. 2a). The conserved active-site residues in the three structures superimpose onto each other (Fig. 2b). The W3 water molecule observed in both the mutant structures at the site occupied by the side chain NHþ group of Lys-154 of wild-type AphA is within 3 hydrogen-bond distances to the Od1 atoms of Asp-46 and Asp-173, and to the main-chain peptide oxygen atom of Val-113. The geometry of the ligands suggests octahedral coordination for Mg(II) in both the mutant structures, like in wild-type AphA. The Od2 atom of Asp-46, the Od1 atom of Asp-169, and the backbone amide oxygen of Asp-48 are three protein ligands of Mg(II), and ordered water molecules occupy the other octahedral sites in all the four subunits of the K154R mutant structure and in three subunits of the K154N mutant structure. All the Mg2+­ligand dis° tances are less than 2.2 A. In the fourth subunit of the K154N tetramer, a phosphate anion is observed in the active-site (Fig. 3a), which refines to ° B-values of nearly 20 A2. Importantly, there is no change in the relative position of the nucleophile Od1 atom of Asp-46 and the phosphorous center; as the result the distance ° between the two atoms remains the same (3.1 A) in the K154N mutant and the wild-type AphA. The phosphate O3 oxygen atom replaces a Mg(II) water ligand, like that in wild-type AphA. The substituted Asn at position 154 does not interact with phosphate or carboxylate of Asp-46 in the mutant structure, the closest approach between Asn and the ° latter groups being about 5.6 A. Further, a distance of nearly ° 3.5 A between Asn-154 and carboxylate of Asp-173 suggests a weak interaction between the two residues. The active-site of the K154N mutant, owing to shorter side chain of asparagine, is filled by additional water molecules, resulting in a second, octahedral cation binding site in the phosphatebound subunit. A Na(I) ion at this site refines to a B-value ° of nearly 12 A2. The ligands to Na(I) ion are the Od1 atoms of Asp-46 and Asp-173, O4 phosphate oxygen, and three water molecules. All the Na1+­ligand distances are observed ° to be less than 2.5 A. The phosphate anion, however, is not observed in the K154R mutant structure. Rather, three ordered water mol° ecules, which refine to B-values of less than 20 A2, are clearly seen in the electron density maps to occupy the

octahedron sites in all the four subunits of the K154R mutant (Fig. 3b). The side chain guanidino group of the substituted Arg is pointing away from the active-site and ° is placed at nearly 4 A from the phosphate observed in the wild-type AphA and K154N mutant structures. The guanidine of the Arg does not interact with the nucleophile Asp-46 as well, as the distance between these two residues ° ° is more than 5 A. The closest approach of 3.5 A is observed between the guanidine of Arg-154 and the carboxylate of Asp-173 in the K154R mutant structure also. Electrostatic potential calculations The negative potential of the nucleophile Od1 atom of Asp-46 changes from À384 kT/e in wild-type AphA to À441 kT/e and À336 kT/e in the K154N and K154R mutants respectively. A significant increase in the negative electrostatic potential of the phosphate oxygen atoms is observed in the mutants, which indicates that the positively charged amino group of Lys-154 could stabilize the negative charge on the substrate phosphate or on the reaction intermediates. The major influence of the replacement of Lys-154 however is observed on the positive electrostatic potential at the phosphorous atom. The electrostatic potential decreases dramatically from 251 kT/e in wildtype AphA to less than 8 kT/e in the mutants, suggesting that the phosphorous atom is more electron deficient and thus more susceptible to a nucleophilic attack, in the wild-type protein. The electrostatic binding energy of Mg(II) for wild-type AphA is estimated to be À39 kT compared to approximately À30.3 kT in the D173N mutant. The difference of 8.7 kT (5.1 kcal molÀ1 at T = 298 K) in the binding free energy would suggest nearly 6000-fold increase in the Kd values for dissociation of Mg(II) from the D173N mutant compared to wild-type AphA. The theoretical estimate of the change in dissociation constant correlates well with the experimental Kd values for dissociation of Mg(II). Discussion Role of Lys-154 The substrate phosphate coordinates directly with Mg(II) in the wild-type and K154N mutant of AphA. The other oxygen atoms of phosphate interact with the side chain NHþ group of loop-3 Lys-154, with Thr-114 and 3 Gly-115 residues of loop-2, and with loop-1 Asp-48 that acts as a general acid/base during catalysis. The nucleo° phile Od1 atom of Asp-46 is placed at nearly 3.1 A from the phosphorous center. Identical phosphate coordination and disposition of the activity-linked groups is also observed in phosphoserine phosphatase [22] and other HAD phosphotransferases (Fig. 4a). Lys-154 of S. typhimurium AphA sequence is conserved in HAD phosphotransferases, except in phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase, where Arg is observed in the known

sequences. The substitution of Lys-154 of S. typhimurium AphA with Asn or Arg leads to significant loss in phosphatase efficiency with the values of steady state constants, Km and kcat, being adversely affected in both the mutants. A poor phosphatase activity has also been reported when Ala and Arg residues substitute for the active-site Lys of phosphoserine phosphatase [24]. In the wild-type AphA structure the side chain NHþ 3 group of Lys-154 is within hydrogen-bond distance from the phosphate O4 oxygen atom, and the Od1 atoms of Asp-46 and Asp-173. The position and the interactions of the side chain amino group of the active-site Lys are remarkably conserved in the known structures of HAD phosphotransferases (Fig. 4a). However, in the crystal structures of the K154N and K154R mutants the substi-

° tuted residues are placed more than 4 A away from the phosphate and Asp positions. The disposition of the active-site aspartates, the cofactor Mg(II) and phosphate anion in the mutant structures is not disturbed, as compared to wild-type AphA. It has been earlier suggested that the role of Lys is to position the aspartyl nucleophile in juxtaposition with the substrate phosphate moiety in E. coli AphA and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotidase [4,25]. Contrary to this, the observed structural conservation of the active-site scaffold in the mutant proteins suggests that the interactions of the residue at position 154 are not essential for proper positioning of the catalytic scaffold. The conserved Lys has also been proposed to be involved in substrate binding or stabilization of the excess of negative charge on the substrate/reaction intermediates in P-type

ATPase [26,27]. The increase in the Km value and the negative electrostatic potentials of the phosphoryl oxygens in the mutants of the AphA protein corroborates these suggestions. Significantly, the negative electrostatic potential at the Od1 atom of Asp-46, which could be taken as a measure of its nucleophilicity, decreases only in the K154R mutant. The most prominent effect of Lys-154 seems to be on the electrostatic potential at the substrate phosphorous atom. The positive electrostatic potential decreases dramatically in the mutants as compared to the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the active-site Lys in wild-type AphA primarily renders the phosphorous atom electron deficient, which could facilitate the nucleophilic attack on the substrate. These functional roles of the lysine, namely, polarizing the substrate phosphate and facilitating substrate binding, are in agreement with isotope-exchange studies carried out for phosphoserine phosphatase which showed that substitution of Lys-158 (equivalent to Lys-154 of S. typhimurium AphA) with Ala and Arg residues inhibits the formation of phosphoenzyme intermediate [24].

The loss of interactions of the substituted residues with phosphate and nucleophile in the mutant structures are due to shorter side chain of Asn in the K154N mutant and because the guanidino group of Arg is pointing away from Asp-46 and phosphate-binding site in the K154R mutant. It can be argued that the side chain NHþ group of Arg 3 could overlap with the activity-linked NHþ group of Lys3 154 of wild-type AphA due to the intrinsic flexibility in the side chain conformation of the former residue. The side chain of Arg-154 in the K154R mutant adopts the frequently observed conformation with v1/v2/v3/v4 values of nearly À53°/168°/À169°/68° {mtt85° conformation [28]}. This differs from the conformation of equivalent Arg of phosphonoacetaldehyde (PDB code 1RQN), which is the only other known HAD protein structure with Arg at position corresponding to Lys-154 of S. typhimurium AphA. The guanidino group of Arg-154 superposes onto the guanidino group of the active-site Arg of phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase in mtt-85° conformation of Arg-154 and the two side chain NHþ groups of the Arg are within 3

hydrogen-bond distance to phosphate oxygen and Od1 of Asp-46, respectively. The superposition of phosphoenzyme intermediate of Methanococcus jannaschii phosphoserine phosphatase (PDB code 1J97) onto the modeled structure of the K154R mutant however reveals a short contact ° (2.3 A) between the side chain NHþ group of the modeled 3 Arg and the oxygen atom of phosphoaspartate intermediate (Fig. 5), suggesting that Arg with mtt-85° conformation at position 154 could interfere with the formation and the correct positioning of the phosphoaspartate intermediate. Role of Asp-173 In the S. typhimurium AphA structure Asp-173 forms hydrogen bonds with a water ligand of Mg(II), with Lys154 and with the main-chain amide of Ser-170. As both the side chain oxygen atoms of Asp-173 are acceptors of

hydrogen bonds, it is expected to be negatively charged. The biochemical data here suggest that the substitution of Asp-173 of S. typhimurium AphA with Asn affects the enzyme function by two independent mechanisms. The D173N mutant binds the cofactor cation loosely and even the Mg(II) activated mutant protein displays poor phosphatase efficiency. These results are similar to the recent observations for other HAD proteins; replacement of the equivalent Asp of phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase led to the severely reduced binding affinity of the cofactor Mg(II) ion [11], and substitution of equivalent Asp in phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase [11], phosphoserine phosphatase [24], Ca2+ ATPase [29] and haloacid dehalogenase [30] produced dramatic reduction in their biochemical activities. The binding affinity of Mg(II) is steeply reduced in the mutant, as the Kd value for dissociation of Mg(II) of the

The arginine side chain was modeled such that its guanidino group overlaps with that of equivalent Arg of phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PDB code 1RQN).

mutant is nearly 10000-fold more than that of wild-type AphA. The estimated dissociation constant from the kinetic data agrees well with the results of the electrostatic potential calculations, thus confirming that the observed reduction in the binding affinity of Mg(II) is due to the loss of the negative charge of Asp-173 in the mutant. Further, the values of electrostatic potentials at phosphate and Asp-46 do not change significantly in the D173N mutant, suggesting a subtle role for Asp-173 in the reaction mechanism. Asp-173 is placed four residues downstream of Asp-169 ligand to Mg(II) in S. typhimurium AphA sequence and is not strictly conserved in the sequences of the HAD phosphotransferases. Superposition of several structures of the HAD phosphotransferases however reveals the structural conservation in the position of the carboxylate group of Asp-173. In the other HAD proteins, the carboxylate group may be contributed by Asp or Glu residue, which could be one residue upstream or 2­7 residues downstream of the invariant Asp corresponding to Asp-169 of S. typhimurium AphA (Fig. 4a and b). The striking similarity in the catalytic scaffold of the HAD phosphotransferases ensures that the interactions of Asp-173 with the active-site Lys, with the main-chain amide of loop-4, and with water ligand of Mg(II) are maintained in the majority of the HAD proteins. It has recently been noted that the interaction between this Asp and the active-site Lys could be important for the biochemical function [25]. We suggest that the negatively charged Asp at position 173, together with the negatively charged atoms of the substrate phosphate and Asp-46, may be responsible for the optimal positioning of the side chain NHþ group of Lys-154. The 3 Asp173Asn substitution, owing to the loss of the negative charge, may disturb the position of the Lys-154 side chain thus affecting the kinetics of the reaction. We also suggest that the conserved interactions of the carboxylate group corresponding to Asp-173 of S. typhimurium with the main-chain amide of loop-4 could also be of functional significance, as the loop-4 harbors the Asp ligand of Mg(II)

(equivalent of Asp-169 of S. typhimurium AphA). Since the side chain amide nitrogen of Asn cannot accept hydrogen bond, it is likely that the subtle changes in the disposition of loop-4 and Asp-169 about Mg(II) also contributes towards the poor catalytic efficiency of the D173N mutant. This suggestion is in line with the observation that Mg(II) binds loosely in the D173N mutant, so that it gets removed from the Mg(II) activated mutant enzyme when the latter is dialyzed against buffer without EDTA. In conclusion, using a combination of mutagenic, kinetic, structural and electrostatic potential data, we show here for the first time that the side chain NHþ group of the 3 conserved Lys-154 enhances the electropositive potential on the phosphorous atom which in turn may assist in the nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphate. Also, it is estimated from the electrostatic potential calculations that Asp-173, owing to its negative charge, contributes significantly towards binding affinity of the cofactor Mg(II). We further suggest that the subtle role of Asp-173 is in the maintenance of the catalytic scaffold due to its conserved interactions with Lys-154 and with main-chain amide nitrogen of the loop-4. Similar functional roles for the active-site lysine and aspartate residues, corresponding to Lys-154 and Asp-173 of S. typhimurium AphA, can be assigned for other HAD phosphotransferases.
