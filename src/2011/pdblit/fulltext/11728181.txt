Two closely related classes of oxindole-based compounds, 1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-phenylhydrazones and 3-(anilinomethylene)-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-ones, were shown to potently inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). The initial lead compound was prepared as a homologue of the 3-benzylidene-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one class of kinase inhibitor. Crystallographic analysis of the lead compound bound to CDK2 provided the basis for analogue design. A semiautomated method of ligand docking was used to select compounds for synthesis, and a number of compounds with low nanomolar inhibitory activity versus CDK2 were identified. Enzyme binding determinants for several analogues were evaluated by X-ray crystallography. Compounds in this series inhibited CDK2 with a potency 10-fold greater than that for CDK1. Members of this class of inhibitor cause an arrest of the cell cycle and have shown potential utility in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia.
Introduction The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulators of the cell cycle,1 the complex process by which cells divide.2 The cell division cycle is commonly viewed as an orderly progression through four distinct phases: (1) G1 (gap 1), the phase in which the cell prepares for DNA synthesis, (2) S (synthesis), the stage in which DNA is replicated, (3) G2 (gap 2), the phase in which the cell prepares for mitosis, and (4) M (mitosis), the stage that leads to chromosome segregation and daughter cell formation. CDKs provide much of the control that is required for the cell to move through these phases in a coordinated manner. As their name implies, the activity of CDKs is dependent upon a regulatory subunit called a cyclin. Members of the cyclin family bind to and activate their CDK partners.3 For example, cyclins A and B activate CDK1, cyclins A and E regulate the activity of CDK2, and the D-type cyclins are associated with CDK4. While the concentration of the CDKs remains relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, cyclin expression and degradation occur in a periodic fashion.4 The rise and fall of cyclin concentrations are timed to provide specific CDK activities as they are needed for progression through the various stages of the cell cycle. Thus, cyclin D is expressed in G1, leading to the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by CDK4; CDK2 is activated by cyclin E in late G1 and by cyclin A during DNA

synthesis; and cyclin B controls the activity of CDK1 during mitosis. Other mechanisms for CDK regulation, such as phosphorylation-dephosphorylation and endogenous protein inhibitors, also play important roles in cell cycle control.5,6 The recognition of the importance of CDKs to the process of cell division has stimulated an interest in them as potential targets for proliferative diseases such as cancer, psoriasis, and restenosis,7-9 and for the prevention of chemotherapy-associated side effects such as alopecia.10,11 A number of small-molecule inhibitors of CDKs have been identified12-17 and are described in recent reviews.18-21 Flavopiridol is the first CDK inhibitor to progress into clinical trials and is being evaluated as an anticancer agent.22,23 In addition, peptide inhibitors of CDK2 were recently shown to preferentially induce transformed cells to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) relative to untransformed cells.24 Here we describe the discovery of a new class of CDK inhibitor, represented by structure 1, that stops cell

cycle progression by inhibiting CDK2 activity in cells and has shown potential utility in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia.11 The initial lead identification, structure-based analogue design, compound synthesis, kinase inhibition data, and X-ray crystal-

lographic structures of CDK2/inhibitor complexes are reported. Compounds with low nanomolar IC50 values for CDK2 were identified, and CDK2 binding determinants were evaluated through crystallographic analyses. Chemistry Isatins and Isatin Hydrazones. Substituted isatins 4 typically were prepared via the classical Sandmeyer reaction25 involving conversion of the substituted aniline with hydroxylamine and chloral hydrate to the intermediate isonitrosoacetanilide 2, followed by cyclization in either concentrated sulfuric acid or boron trifluoride etherate as shown in Scheme 1. Alternatively, for some meta-substituted anilines (R ) iPr, Ph, OEt) where this methodolgy failed, the isatin synthesis of Hewawasam and Meanwell26 was followed. In that procedure, the aniline was protected as the tert-butylcarbonate (3). Ortho-lithiation of intermediate 3 and treatment with diethyl oxalate gave the R-ketoester, which upon exposure to aqueous acid underwent cyclization to the isatin. Subsequent condensation of the substituted isatin 4 with an arylhydrazine in ethanol, either using the hydrazine salt or one equivalence of hydrochloric acid, yielded the isatin hydrazone 1. A number of 4-alkylisatin hydrazones 7 were prepared as shown in Scheme 2. Heck coupling of 4-iodoisatin with alkenes produced 4-alkenylisatins 5, which were converted to the corresponding hydrazones 6. Subsequent reduction furnished the 4-alkylisatin hydrazones 7. A series of 5-carboxamides 10 were prepared from the pentafluorophenyl ester 9, which was derived from the corresponding carboxylic acid 8 by treatment with pentafluorophenyl trifuoroacteamide (Scheme 3). Oxindoles. Oxindoles 12 were obtained, as delineated in Scheme 4, either directly from the corresponding isatin 4 by Wolf Kishner reduction27 or alternatively from the substituted aniline via the Gassman synthe-

sis.28 This latter procedure involved sequential treatment of the aniline with tert-butyl hypochlorite, ethyl (methylthio)acetate, triethylamine, and hydrochloric acid to give the 3-methylthiooxindole 11, which was desulfurized with zinc or Raney nickel to give the corresponding oxindole 12. A modification of the Gassman procedure29 involving initial mixing of ethyl (methylthio)acetate and sulfuryl chloride, followed by addition of the aniline with one equivalent of Proton Sponge and finally triethylamine treatment, was employed to prepare compounds that were not accessible via the original Gassman procedure, e.g., the oxindole ester (R ) 5-CO2Me). Conversion of the oxindole to the dimethylaminomethinyloxindole or ethoxymethinyloxindole 13 (X ) H) was achieved with dimethylformamide-N,N-di-tert-butyl acetal or diethoxymethyl acetate, respectively, and subsequent condensation with an aniline yielded the enamine 14 (X ) H). The corresponding methyl-substituted enamines 14 (X ) Me) were obtained using dimethylacetamide-N,N-dimethyl acetal following the same procedure. Stereochemistry. As viewed by their 1H NMR spectra, the isatin hydrazones and corresponding enamines exist predominately as the Z (cis) conformation in solution, presumably due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the NH of the hydrazone/enamine linkage and the carbonyl group of the indolinone. Confirmation of this stereochemistry was achieved for the enamine by observation of a nuclear Overhauser effect between the 4-position proton of the oxindole ring system and the vinyl hydrogen of the enamine linkage for the 5-carboxylic ester (R ) 5-CO2iBu, compound 55, Table 1). In some analogues where a heteroatom (O or N) containing functionality was substituted at the 4-position of the oxindole, allowing formation of an alternative hydrogen bond with the linker NH in the E (trans) conformation, 1H NMR spectra of equilibrated samples corresponded to mixtures of Z and E isomers. For example, the 4-phenoxy derivative 32 was observed as a 5:2 Z:E mixture after 10 days of equilibration, and the 4-carboxamido analogue 40 was found as a 1:7 Z:E mixture. Occasionally, compounds in the series precipitated from the reaction solution as a mixture of Z and

E isomers, as indicated by NMR. However, in the absence of a hydrogen bond acceptor at position-4, equilibration led to disappearance of signals for the E isomer. Results and Discussion Lead Discovery. As part of an ongoing effort to identify selective inhibitors of protein kinases, analogues of the 3-(benzylidene)indolin-2-ones 15 were examined. The indolin-2-ones 15 are known inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor and Her-2,30 and a closely related compound shows selective inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 kinase.31 Compounds 16-19, available in one synthetic step from commercial materials, were prepared as homologues of compounds 15 and assayed for inhibition of various kinases. Compounds 17-19 were inactive (IC50 >10 µM) against all kinases tested, but compound 16 selectively inhibited CDK2 (IC50 ) 60 nM) and served as the lead compound for the work described here.

Analogue Design. A structure-based selection process was used to explore analogues in this series of compounds. CDK232 and its complexes with ATP,32-34 cyclin A,35,36 the protein inhibitor p27,37 and small molecule inhibitors12,20,38 have been studied by X-ray crystallography.5 To evaluate and select potential analogues for synthesis, we utilized the crystal structure of compound 16 bound to the inactive form of CDK2 (Figure 1). This monomeric form of the kinase offers crystallographic advantages over the activated cyclin A complex, including higher resolution, a smaller structure, and one molecule in the asymmetric unit versus two for the cyclin A complex. However, the activation of CDK2 by complexing with cyclin A induces conformational changes in the protein that affect the ATP binding site to some degree. The most significant effect involves a rotation of the C-helix, which alters the active-site geometry in the region of the triad of catalytic active-site residues Lys-33, Glu-51, and Asp-145. As

discussed below, the amino group of Lys-33 was considered to be a potential interaction site for inhibitors. Thus, structures of inhibitor complexes with inactive CDK2 should be viewed with some caution, especially regarding inhibitor-protein interactions involving the Lys-33 region of the enzyme. Inhibitor 16 was found to occupy the ATP binding site of CDK2 as shown in Figure 1. The oxindole ring system of compound 16 interacted with CDK2 in a manner analogous to that observed for compounds in inhibitor class 15 bound to fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase.39 Two hydrogen bonds were formed between the lactam moiety of compound 16 and CDK2. Specifically, the amide NH was H-bonded to the backbone carbonyl of Glu-81 and the amide carbonyl oxygen was H-bonded with the backbone NH of Leu-83. Those interactions were analogous to hydrogen bonds between ATP and CDK2. Inspection of the CDK2/compound 16 structure furnished a number of guidelines for analogue design. The 7-position of the oxindole ring system was positioned close to the side chain of Phe-80 and appeared to be too sterically crowded to permit substitution. The 6-position projected toward a small cavity at the back of the binding cleft and into the region affected by cyclin A association. This cavity is smaller in size, relative to

many other protein kinases, due to the bulkiness of the Phe-80 side chain. That part of the cleft appeared to be compatible with small substituents. The juxtaposition of the 5-position and Lys-33 suggested hydrogen-bond acceptors at that location on the oxindole might enhance inhibitor affinity. Lipophilic substituents at position-4 appeared to be appropriate for the relatively hydrophobic environment of that region of the protein (Val-18 and Leu-134). In addition to these observations regarding potential oxindole substitution, the structure also suggested that the sulfonamide group positioned at the cleft opening might provide a site for substitution that could be used to alter compound properties such as solubility and pharmacokinetics, without negatively affecting enzyme affinity and possibly increasing affinity and selectivity. Molecular modeling was used to evaluate and select potential substituents at the 4-7 positions of the oxindole template. A semiautomated computational procedure was developed to generate and dock virtual analogues in this class of inhibitor to CDK2. The synthetic routes to the oxindole ring system that we

employed generally utilized anilines as starting materials (see Chemistry section). A set of 410 anilines, considered compatible with synthesis conditions, was selected from commercially available anilines using a molecular weight cutoff of 250. Each of the selected aniline structures was then electronically converted to the corresponding analogue of compound 16, and the hypothetical analogue was docked into the ATP binding site of the CDK2/cyclin A structure. The details of this docking procedure are provided in the experimental section. Synthetic targets were selected using a combination of molecular mechanics energy scores and careful visual inspection of each docked structure. The initial set of prepared compounds resulting from this protocol, e.g., compounds 22, 27, 31, 49, 50, 56, 79, and 81 (Table 1), were potent inhibitors of CDK2 and provided the basis for subsequent synthetic efforts. The use of modeling for designing substituents on the pendant hydrazone or enamine portion of the inhibitors was not pursued extensively because of the complexities associated with evaluating the effects of solvent at the protein-solvent interface.

Results from compounds prepared in this study are discussed below and organized by regions of the core inhibitor template. Hydrazone/Enamine Linker. The hydrazone linkage between the inhibitor's indolinone ring and phenyl group imposed a number of synthetic restrictions on the accessibility of potential inhibitors, limiting the diversity of phenyl substituents that could be explored. Replacement of the hydrazone connection with an enamine would provide significantly expanded access to substituents on both the indolinone and phenyl rings through well-established synthetic routes. This synthetic flexibility permitted the preparation of a diverse set of inhibitors that were used to develop an understanding of CDK2 inhibition and selectivity. Preparation and evaluation of hydrazone-enamine pairs of compounds demonstrated that the enamine substitution for hydrazone was essentially inconsequential to enzyme binding (compare compounds 17 and 18, 22 and 23, 79 and 80, and 81 and 82, Table 1). Molecular modeling evaluation was concordant with that observation. Also consistent with structural and modeling considerations was the observation that the carbon atom of the enamine linkage could be substituted with groups larger than hydrogen, such as methyl, without negatively affecting inhibition of CDK2 (compare CDK2 IC50 values for compounds 18 versus 19, 20 versus 21, and 23 versus 24). In recent patent literature, a group from Boerhringer Ingelheim describe related CDK inhibitors containing an aryl-substituted enamine linkage.40 4-Substituents. As pointed out above, binding of inhibitor 16 to CDK2 placed the 4-position in a hydrophobic region of the enzyme active site. Thus, hydrophobic substituents were expected to enhance affinity for CDK2, while hydrophilic groups would be detrimental. These expectations were realized as evidenced by the inhibitory activities of compounds 25-40 (Table 1). Compounds with lipophilic substituents such as ethyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, and isobutenyl (compounds 26-29)

were potent inhibitors of CDK2 with IC50 values in the range of 1-8 nM. The 4-position projected toward the opening of the binding site, and large hydrophobic substituents were accommodated, as illustrated by compounds 33-35. In contrast, hydrophilic groups at the 4-position generally were detrimental to binding. For example, the 4-nitro and 4-amido derivatives 39 and 40 showed relatively weak inhibition of CDK2. 5-Substituents. Many of the compounds containing substituents at the 5-position were designed to interact with CDK2 via hydrogen bonding to the side chain of Lys-33 and/or the backbone NH of Asp-145. Carboxylic esters were particularly active inhibitors (Table 1), an observation consistent with those substituents being capable of forming a hydrogen bond with Lys-33 and positioning a hydrophobic group in the lipophilic region near position 4. The 5-ozazolyl-substituted derivatives 22-24 also fit that paradigm and were potent inhibitors of the enzyme. In addition, the amide group was found to be a favorable 5-substituent and provided a convenient handle for introducing water-solubilizing substituents (compounds 56-62). Modeling suggested a particularly favorable steric fit for the dimethoxyphenyl group of amide 63, consistent with its effective inhibition of CDK2. Charged substituents such as sulfonic and carboxylic acids provided no advantage over similar neutral substituents. For example, the carboxylic acid 52 was 10-fold weaker than the corresponding methyl ester 53 as an inhibitor of CDK2. Fluorine, iodine, and methyl substituents at the 5-position were also compatible with kinase binding. However, the dimethylaminocontaining compound 48 was a relatively poor inhibitor. 6-Substituents. The inhibition activities of 6-substituted analogues (Table 1) were in accord with the relatively small CDK2 pocket adjacent to that position in the enzyme structure. Smaller substituents such as ethyl (65), isopropyl (66), and hydroxymethyl (68) moderately contribute to affinity as compared to the corresponding 6-hydrogen derivatives 17 and 18. In contrast, no measurable inhibition was observed for compounds containing larger substituents such as tertbutyl (67) and phenoxy (69). 7-Substituents. In the crystal structure of compound 16 in complex with CDK2 (Figure 1), the 7-position of the inhibitor was oriented toward the side chain methylene group of Phe-80 with a C-7 to C distance of 3.3 Å. Therefore, substituents at position-7 would be expected to encounter unfavorable steric interactions with the enzyme. The lack of activity found for 7-methyl derivatives (see Table 1) was consistent with that expectation. For example, comparison of the CDK2 IC50 values of the 5,7-dimethyl derivative 71 and the 5-methyl analogue 43 (see Table 1) indicated that 7-methyl substitution produced a >200-fold decrease in affinity. 4,5-Disubstituents. Disubstitution at the 4- and 5-positions can provide highly potent inhibitors of CDK2. As shown in Table 1, compounds with 4,5-fused heterocycles that contain a hydrogen bond acceptor at the 5-position and hydrophobic character at the 4-position, such as compounds 80 and 81, display high affinity for CDK2. The structure of compound 91 bound to the CDK2/cyclin A complex illustrates the potential for hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Lys-33 and the

Complex 1 appeared to be the more relevant of the two complexes on the basis of other CDK2/cyclin A/inhibitor crystal structures that often showed no electron density for the inhibitor in complex 2. N-Substituted Sulfonamides. As shown in Figure 1, the sulfonamide moiety of compound 16 interacts with Asp-86 at the opening to the binding cleft of CDK2. The sulfonamide moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH and the side chain carboxylate functionality of Asp-86. The position of the sulfonamide at the solvent interface suggested that sulfonamide substituents might have little interaction with the enzyme and would project into solution. This orientation at the mouth of the binding cleft suggested that sulfonamide substituents might be used to modify properties such as solubility and pharmacokinetic parameters without detrimentally affecting enzyme affinity. The inhibition data shown in Table 2 illustrates the relative insensitivity of CDK2 to substituents on the sulfonamide group. One exception was the 2,6-dimethylphenyl analogue 93, which was significantly weaker as an inhibitor of CDK2 than the other substituted

sulfonamides. The poor activity of this compound presumably was related to the expected steric constraints imposed by the ortho-methyl groups of the phenyl moiety. Our initial assumption was that both hydrogen bonds between the sulfonamide and protein were important to affinity. However, the inhibitory activities of disubstituted sulfonamide derivatives and crystal structures of several monosubstituted sulfonamide analogues bound to CDK2 indicated that the hydrogen bond between sulfonamide and backbone NH played the more important role in binding. As shown in Table 2, similar inhibition activities were observed for -SO2N(CH3)R and -SO2N(H)R pairs of compounds: 83 versus 84, 88 versus 89, and 91 versus 92. These data suggest that the sulfonamide NH-carboxylate (Asp-86) hydrogen bond observed in the crystal structure of the CDK2 complex with compound 16 was not significantly contributing to the protein/ligand affinity. This conclusion was supported by additional crystallographic data. For example, the N-methylsulfonamide derivative 83, which is equipotent to the corresponding unsubstituted sulfonamide 80, was found to bind to CDK2 with a sulfonamide oxygen H-bonded to the backbone NH of Asp-86 but with its N-methyl group, not its NH, oriented toward the carboxylate of Asp-86 (see Figure 3). The amino(imino)methyl substituted sulfonamide analogue 101 was found to bind to CDK2 with its sulfonamide NH positioned away from Asp-86 (see Figure 3). The heterocyclic-substituted sulfonamide derivatives 92 and

100 both bound to the kinase with the sulfonamide NH oriented toward the carboxylate of Asp-86 but at an N-to-O distance of 5 and 4 Å, respectively. In each of the above structures, the sulfonamide oxygen was H-bonded to the backbone NH of Asp-86, suggesting an importance to that interaction. As will be discussed below, the latter H-bond was a consistent feature in two other related sulfone-containing compounds. Sulfonamide Replacements. In concert with the conclusion that the sulfonamide NH was not important to binding, the methyl sulfone analogue 102 was found to strongly inhibit CDK2, as shown in Table 2. Interestingly, compounds in which the sulfonamide was linked to the phenyl ring by a methylene group were also significantly active, as exemplified by compounds 103 and 105. An X-ray crystal structure of compound 105 bound to CDK2 showed that the inhibitor was able to adopt a conformation that provided interactions between the sulfonamide and Asp-86 similar to those observed for compound 16, as illustrated in Figure 4. A crystal structure of the fused cyclic sulfone 109 bound to CDK2 showed a hydrogen bond from the sulfone to the backbone NH of Asp-86 (see Figure 5), similar to that observed in the other CDK2 complexes described above. Kinase Selectivity. The compounds in the series described here were generally about 10-fold more potent as inhibitors of CDK2 than of CDK1. The correlation

coefficient relating pIC50 values for CDK2 versus CDK1 was 0.90. This observation is in accord with the relatively high overall sequence similarity (69% identity) between the two kinases and the essentially identical composition of the ATP binding sites (residues 79, 84, and 85 differ but their side chains project away from the ATP site). The compounds displayed a range of activity against a panel of other protein kinases but were generally selective for CDK2. A typical example is compound 91, which showed the following inhibition activities [kinase, IC50 (nM)]: CDK4, 130; c-fms, 950; erbB-2, >10000; erk-2, 21000; gsk-3, 56; lck, 980; mek, 25000; p38, 32000; src, 440; raf, 7600; tie-2, 3500; VEGFR-2, 22. Cellular Activities. The most potent and CDK2selective compounds were evaluated in two cellular assays: an anti-proliferation assay and a mechanistic assay that measures progression from G1- to S-phase (example data shown in Table 3). The compounds inhibited proliferation of tumor cells, with IC50 values consistent with CDK2 inhibitors that are competitive with respect to ATP. The anti-proliferative activity of the compounds was up to 8-fold selective for the tumor cells relative to the HFF normal cell line. The compounds were also active in blocking progression of cells into S-phase, consistent with the role of CDK2 activity in the regulation of G1/S phase progression. The antiproliferative activity of compound 91 has been shown

To a 1-L three-neck round-bottom flask was placed a magnetic stir bar and 100 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask was fitted with a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the reaction. The sulfuric acid was heated to 100 °C, and 10.0 g (45.2 mmol) of N-benzothiazol-6-yl-2-hydroxyimino-acetamide was added slowly. The solution was heated for 1 h, and the reaction mixture was poured into 750 g of ice and water. The residual reaction mixture in the reaction vessel was washed out with an additional 20 mL of cold water. The aqueous slurry was stirred for about 1 h and filtered. The solid was washed thoroughly with water, filtered, and air-dried to yield 4.3 g (46%) of 6H-[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-e]indole-7,8-dione: 1H NMR (DMSO-d6):  11.1 (s, 1H), 9.2 (s, 1H), 8.2 (d, 1H), 7.0 (d, 1H); APCI m/z 203 (M-H)-. Procedure B. A second method for 1H-indol-2,3-dione (isatin) synthesis42 is exemplified by the preparation of 6-phenoxy-1H-indole-2,3-dione. To a stirred solution of 1.0 g (6.0 mmol) of chloral hydrate in 25 mL of water was added 7.0 g (22 mmol) of sodium sulfate decahydrate, followed by a solution of 1.18 g (17.0 mmol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 10 mL of water. A solution of 1.0 g (5.4 mmol) of 3-phenoxyaniline in 10 mL of 1.0 N HCl was then added with stirring. The resulting suspension was warmed, and 40 mL of 95% EtOH was added to dissolve the suspension. The solution was refluxed for 0.75 h and then cooled to ambient temperature. The resulting solid was collected by vacuum filtration and airdried to afford 0.95 g (67%) of 2-hydroxyimino-N-(3-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide as a solid: 1H NMR (DMSO-d6):  6.42 (d, J ) 8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.06 (d, J ) 7.9 Hz, 2H), 7.18 (t, J ) 7.3 Hz, 1H), 7.25-7.50 (m, 5H), 7.64 (s, 1H), 10.29 (s, 1H), 12.21 (s, 1H); APCI: m/z 255 (M-H)-. A suspension of 0.15 g (0.58 mmol) of 2-hydroxyimino-N-(3-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide in 0.4 mL of BF3 etherate was heated to 85 °C for 0.75 h.

The resulting solid was collected by vacuum filtration and subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel (hexane/ EtOAc 1.5:1) to afford 6-phenoxy-1H-indole-2,3-dione as a solid (0.018 g, 13%): 1H NMR (DMSO-d6):  6.44 (d, J ) 2.0 Hz, 1H), 6.56 (dd, J ) 2.0, 8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.08 (d, J ) 8.2 Hz, 1H), 7.22-7.29 (m, 1H), 7.38-7.46 (m, 2H), 7.52 (d, J ) 8.4 Hz, 1H), 9.05 (s, 1H); APCI: m/z 255 (M+Na)+. Procedure C. A third method for 1H-indol-2,3-dione (isatin) synthesis:26 preparation of 4-isopropoxy-1H-indol-2,3-dione and conversion to 4-[N-(4-isopropoxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-indol-3ylidene)-hydrazino]-benzenesulfonamide (31). A solution of 3.78 g (25.0 mmol) of 3-isopropoxy aniline and 5.46 g (25.0 mmol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in 25 mL of THF was heated to reflux for 2 h. The solution was cooled to ambient temperature, and solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 100 mL of EtOAc, and the solution was washed with three 50-mL portions of 0.5 M citric acid and 50 mL of brine. The solution was dried over MgSO4, and removal of solvent in vacuo afforded N-(tert-butyloxy-carbonyl)-3-isopropoxyaniline as a white solid (5.75 g, 92%): mp 79-81 °C; 1H NMR (DMSO-d ):  1.21 (d, J ) 6.0 Hz, 6H), 1.43 (s, 9H), 6 4.46 (septet, J ) 6 Hz, 1H), 6.47 (dd, J ) 2.1, 8.1 Hz, 1H), 6.94 (d, J ) 8.1 Hz, 1H), 7.0-7.1 (m, 2H), 9.23 (s, 1H); APCI: m/z 274 (M+Na)+. To a solution of 2.5 g (10 mmol) of N-(tertbutyloxycarbonyl)-3-isopropoxyaniline in 15 mL of dry THF at -78 °C was added 15 mL (25 mmol) of 1.7 M tertbutyllithium in hexanes. The mixture was stirred at -20 °C for 2 h. A solution of 1.84 g (12.5 mmol) of diethyl oxalate in 10 mL of dry THF was added slowly over 5 min, and the mixture was stirred at -20 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then poured into 100 mL of 1.0 N HCl and extracted with two 100-mL portions of EtOAc. Solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in 100 mL of a 1:1 mixture of EtOH and 6 N HCl and heated to reflux for 1 h. The mixture

to arrest cells and protect normal cells from chemotherapy-induced toxicity.11 These data were consistent with an anti-proliferative mechanism expected for inhibition of CDK2 and suggested that this series of inhibitors has therapeutic potential for treating proliferative disorders, including chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Conclusions The compounds described here represent a novel class of CDK2 inhibitor. Crystallographic analysis showed that the initial lead compound was bound in the ATP site of the kinase, and structure-assisted methods provided an effective means of developing a large set of compounds with low nanomolar CDK2 IC50 values. Binding interactions were studied through analogue synthesis and X-ray crystallographic analysis of several CDK2/inhibitor complexes. A hydrogen bond between inhibitors and the backbone NH of Asp-86 near the opening of the ATP binding cleft of CDK2 was of particular interest and appeared to play a significant role in affinity. Members of this series of inhibitors cause an arrest of the cell cycle and exhibit a selective killing effect on several tumor cell lines.41 In addition, these compounds may have utility in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced hair loss.11 Experimental Section
General Methods. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on VARIAN Unity Plus NMR spectrophotometers at 300 or 400 MHz. Mass spectra were obtained on Micromass Platform II mass spectrometers from Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK, using either atmospheric chemical ionization (APCI) or electrospray ionization (ESI). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used to verify the purity of some intermediates that could not be isolated or that were too unstable for full characterization and to follow the progress of reactions. Merck Silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) was employed for the flash chromatographic purification of some compounds. Procedure A. A typical procedure for the synthesis of isatin25 is exemplified by the preparation of 6H-[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-e]indole-7,8-dione. To a 1-L flask was added a magnetic stir bar, 85 g of sodium sulfate, and 100 mL of water. The mixture was magnetically stirred until all the solids were dissolved. To the resultant aqueous solution was added a solution of 6-aminobenzothiazole (4.96 g, 33.0 mmol) in 50 mL of 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid and 10 mL of ethanol. The mixture was stirred, and chloral hydrate (6.0 g, 36 mmol) was added. To the resultant solution was added a solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (7.50 g, 108 mmol) in 30 mL of water. The final mixture was heated with stirring to a gentle boil until all solids dissappeared, and heating was continued for an additional 15 min. The flask was removed from the heat, and the solution was poured onto 500 g of ice. The mixture

Anal. (C20H15N3O4S,H2O) C, H, N, S. Molecular Modeling. Favorable substitutions on the core oxindole template (positions 4-7) were identified via a ligandprotein docking protocol. Initially, commercially available anilines were identified and converted to their corresponding SMILES51 strings. These anilines were prefiltered for chemically reactive groups and molecular weight criteria to yield an initial starting set of 410 anilines. In-house virtual chemistry algorithms were then used to convert the anilines to the corresponding 4-[2-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)hydrazino]benzene-sulfonamides. In the case of asymmetric anilines containing a meta-substituent, two possible oxindole products could result from the chemistry (yielding 4- or 6-substituted oxindoles), and both products were investigated via the docking algorithms. The SMILES strings were then converted to the X-PLOR52 psf/pdb molecule format via in-house algorithms. Initially, the atomic coordinates for each molecule were assigned dummy values. The molecule psf/pdb's served as input for an X-PLOR high-temperature dynamics script for conformational searching. Each molecule was heated at 2000 °C for 0.5 ps, followed by a 0.2 ps simulation at 100 °C, followed by 200 steps of minimization. This process was repeated 100 times for each molecule to yield 100 starting conformations. Conformations with energy greater than 7.5 kcal/mol above the lowest energy structure identified were rejected. Remaining conformations were rms superimposed, and, in cases where two structures had a heavy atom rms deviation of less than 0.25 Å, the higher energy structure was rejected. The lowest energy conformation for each molecule was used as input for a Gaussian53 quantum mechanics calculation to obtain partial atomic charges. Molecules were optimized using the semiempirical PM3 basis set followed by a Hartree-Fock 3-21G* single point calculation.54,55 In the latter step, charges were obtained using the CHELPG methodology.56 Molecule topologies and conformations were then converted into a format suitable for use in docking calculations employing the Macromodel software package.57 The initial protein conformation was taken from the CDK2-cyclin A-flavopiridol complex solved in-house. Additionally, the X-ray structure of CDK2 in complex with compound 16 was used to generate an initial positioning for the oxindole template. Initial docking was accomplished by rms fitting to the coordinates for the oxindole moiety of compound 16. These coordinates were also used as positional restraints for the conformations of the derivative molecules. Energy minimization calculations were then performed using the GB/SA solvation model58 with 12 Å cutoffs for nonbonded interactions. Residues within an 8 Å sphere of the ATP binding site were allowed to adjust to the presence of the ligand while other atoms within the protein were restrained. Following minimization, the molecules were scored and sorted according to "binding" energy. This energy included ligand internal energy differences (relative to the lowest energy

The coordinates for the lowest energy bound conformation of each molecule were then saved to file. Each final docked molecule structure was visually inspected. This inspection, in conjunction with a consideration of the binding energy scores, was used to select molecules for synthesis. Crystallography. The procedures for protein expression, purification, crystallization, and crystal structure determination of the CDK2 complexes reported here have been described previously.11,38,59 All structures were derived from CDK2 or CDK2/cyclin A crystals that were soaked in solutions containing inhibitor. Crystallographic data is shown in Table 4. Enzymology. Human CDK2/cyclin A was expressed in insect cells and purified as previously described for the production of CDK2,59 except for the following changes. Human CDK2 and human cyclin A were coexpressed in Baculovirusinfected T.ni cells. An HS (Poros) column was equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and human CDK2/cyclin A was eluted from this column with 0.3 M NaCl. Final purification was accomplished using a Pharmacia S-200 Superdex column in place of the S-75 column used for the CDK2 preparation. CDK2/cyclin A was stored at -80 °C prior to use. Human CDK1 was expressed and purified using the procedures noted above for the production of CDK2 except for the following changes. Human CDK1/cyclin A was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The complex was step-eluted from the HS column (Poros) with 0.4 M NaCl. Enzymecontaining fractions were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Enzyme assays were performed in 96-well plates. Briefly, compounds were diluted in 100% DMSO and transferred in 25-100% DMSO. Serial 2- or 3-fold dilutions were made. Assays contained 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 5% DMSO (with and without inhibitor), 1.4 µM [-32P]ATP (0.07 µCi/well), 1.5 µM of the peptide Biotinaminohexyl-Ala-Arg-Arg-Pro-Met-Ser-Pro-Lys-LysLys-Ala-CONH2 and enzyme. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 20-30 min (CDK2) or 30-60 min (CDK1). The DMSO solutions were added to the assay plate first, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Enzyme concentrations in the assays were 5-10 nM for both CDK1/ cyclin A and CDK2/cyclin A as determined by protein titration. The enzyme catalyzed reactions were terminated by the addition of four assay volumes of 100 mM EDTA in PBS (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mg of Neutravidin-coated SPA beads (Amersham Pharmacia). The plates were allowed to sit undisturbed for 8-24 h prior to quantitation using a scintillation counter. Values for pIC50 were obtained using nonlinear regression analysis according to the equation y ) bkgnd + ((B0 - bkgnd)/ (1 + [inhibitor]/10-pIC50)) where B0 is the enzyme activity in the absence of inhibitor and y is the measured activity. The average standard deviation of pIC50 values for this assay was 0.36. Cell Anti-Proliferation Assay. Inhibition of cell growth was measured by a standard MTT assay using a panel of

tumor cell lines (RKO, HT29, SW620, MDAMB468) and cells isolated from human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF). Briefly, cells were seeded (2500 to 5000 cells/well) in 96-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were incubated with compound for 72 h in DMEM media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cellular metabolic activity, an indicator of cell viability, was assessed using MTT.60 Cells were treated with a range of compound concentrations in duplicate to generate dose-response curves. The compound concentration required to inhibit 50% of cell growth (IC50) was determined using a nonlinear regression analysis. G1/S Phase Progression Assay. Inhibition of progression of cells from G1 into S-phase was measured using a BrdU incorporation assay. HFF cells were grown to confluency for synchronization. Cells were then plated in 96-well plates for 18 h, compound was added for 2 h, then cells were co-treated with BrdU for 4 h. BrdU incorporated into cellular DNA was detected and quantitated using an antibody sandwich BrdU ELISA. Dose response curves were generated by varying the compound concentration (in triplicate). The compound concentration required to inhibit 50% of BrdU incorporation (IC50) was determined using a nonlinear regression analysis.
