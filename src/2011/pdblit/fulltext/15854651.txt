Abstract An amperometric, enzyme-channeling immunosensor was used to study the qualitative and quantitative aspects of molecular biorecognition in real time. The immunosensor consisted of a polyethylenimine-modified carbon electrode on which glucose oxidase was coimmobilized with a specific antibody or with calmodulin. The immunological reactions were monitored electrochemically in situ, and the binding curves were directly visualized on a computer screen. This approach was applied for estimating the kinetic constants of the reaction between IgG and its specific anti-IgG antibodies, as well as for mapping of sites and the interaction of calmodulin and its target peptides and proteins via its monoclonal antibodies. The respective association and dissociation rate constants for IgGrantiIgG were calculated as 1.3 = 10 6 My1 sy1 and 0.2 = 10y3 sy1. The site-mapping of phosphodiesterase, melittin, calcineurin, or mastoparan on the calmodulin molecule were estimated using two conformation-dependent mAbs, CAM1 and CAM4, whose epitopes were previously located. The data presented confirm that the amperometric, enzyme-channeling immunosensor may be used as a tool for valuable characterizing of biospecific interactions, such as determining the concentration of molecules, selecting different antibodies, and characterizing the binding sites of biomolecules. q 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

1. Introduction Direct real-time biospecific interaction analysis is an important implement for studying the interaction between biomolecules and understanding the relationship between the structure of a molecule and its biological function w1≠3x. Traditionally, interactions between biomolecules have been measured using labeled molecules, for example, a radioisotope, an enzyme or a fluorescent probe w4≠6x. The labeling methods have a high sensitivity and can determine very low concentrations of substances. However, these methods are usually performed in several steps and are not suitable for direct and rapid kinetic measurements. The aim of modern biosensor technology is the development of rapid and sensitive bioassay systems with immediate real-time interpretation of results, simplicity of use

and cost effectiveness w7≠12x. Over the past year, a number of publications have appeared that describe the utility of the physico-chemical methods for direct detection of the binding events on a sensor surface w13≠15x. The key advantage of the direct method is that it allows real-time analysis of biospecific reactions without labeling requirements. Direct method of immunoanalysis offers the opportunity to obtain biological information, such as the specificity and kinetics of binding between molecules, epitope mapping, steric and allosteric effects, Zin addition to the concentration of the biomolecules. w1,2x. However, the sensitivity of these systems is not enough and interpreting interaction of kinetics has proved difficult. Electrochemical immunosensors that combine enzyme-channeling immunoassay techniques with an electrochemical detection product of enzymatic reaction can provide real-time monitoring of immunological reactions with high sensitivity as an alternative to other antibody-based assays w16≠18x. In previous reports, we described a one-step, amperometric enzyme-channeling immunosensor for monitoring biological substances w19,20x. The immunosensor was tested in

assays of antibodies, hormones and viruses without washing and separation stages. Because an enzyme-channeling immunosensor allows a direct monitoring of immunological reactions, it may be used as a tool to directly estimate the affinity and kinetics of macromolecular interactions of binding sites, as well as steric and allosteric effects. In the present work, we applied enzyme-channeling immunosensors for the study of: Z1. antibody≠antigen interaction kinetics and their associationrdissociation rate and affinity constants; and Z2. site-mapping of target proteins for binding on calmodulin molecule. Calmodulin modulates the activity of many proteins, including protein kinases, a protein phosphatase, nitric oxide synthase, NAD kinase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, Ca2q pumps, and proteins involved in motility w21x. The main question of our study was whether the binding sites of calmodulin are the same as or different from the binding sites of its various target proteins. The interaction between calmodulin and its target proteins and peptides was investigated immunochemically using two specific anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibodies ZCAM1 and CAM4., which bind at different regions previously localized and characterized by Wolf et al. w22x.

Standard electrochemical equipment for amperometric measurements can be used for monitoring the sensor response. We used an EG & G PAR 273 potentiostat interfaced to a PC 486 computer system with PAR M270 software. 2.4. Kinetic measurements of biospecific interactions Determining the kinetic rate of biospecific interactions relies on the covalent immobilization of one of the interacting species onto an electrode surface and observing the binding of the soluble ligate. The assay followed the schematic diagram shown in Fig. 1.

The 5-am inosalicylic acid quinoneimine Z5-ASA-QI. formed was continuously monitored amperometrically by reduction at y0.02 V vs. AgrAgCl. In several experiments, iodide ions were used as mediators of peroxidase reactions instead of 5-ASA. Control experiments were performed under the same conditions with a non-specific GOD≠BSA-modified electrode. Kinetic measurements were performed according to the method of Karlsson et al. w24x. According to the Langmurian theory, the rate of association of a surface-immobilized ligand and its ligate may be described as: d Grdt s k a Co Z Gm y G . y k d G

Z 1.

where G is the surface concentration of captured ligate, Co is the solution concentration of ligate, Gm is the total binding capacity of the electrode surface, k a is the association rate constant, and k d is the dissociation constant. In our previous studies w19,20x, we showed that the response of the amperometric immunosensor is proportional to the surface concentration of the analyte. Hence, the change in analytical signal reflects the real antibody≠ antigen binding kinetics on the electrode surface, and therefore, I s k G , where k is the proportional factor relating current to surface concentration w24x. By substituting the current observable response Z I ., Eq. Z1. becomes: d Irdt s k a Co Z Im y I . y k d I

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Estimation of kinetic constants We studied the binding kinetics of antiRbIgG-HRP with RbIgG immobilized on the electrode surface. The surface of electrodes in solution is generally surrounded by an unstirred layer of solvent, the Nernst layer, which restricts the diffusion and mass transport of substances across the liquidrsolid interface. Therefore, the observed binding rate may reflect the mass transport limitations of glucose and conjugate to the electrode surface, together with the kinetics of the enzymatic and immunological reactions. To shift

the balance from mass transport to reaction rate limitation, we used a high rate of stirring of the buffer Z500 rpm., with an antiRbIgG-HRP concentration in excess over the immobilized amount of antibodies Z2.6 = 10y1 5 mol mmy2 . on the electrode surface. Fig. 2 shows a typical dynamic response of the graphite electrode with immobilized glucose oxidase and peroxidase. After the addition of glucose, the analytical signal changed immediately and reached a stable value within 10 s. The reason for the extremely rapid response is the effect of `channeling' the H 2 O 2 directly to the peroxidase on the electrode surface. These response times are comparable with the fastest response times reported in the literature for other types of glucose oxidase sensors w25x. Concerning the kinetics of immunological reaction, approximately 20≠25 min were required after adding the antiRbIgG-HRP to the cell for the base current to attain a steady value. This means that the rate-limiting step in an enzyme-channeling immunoassay is the kinetic of binding conjugate to the immobilized antibodies and the binding data can be described by Eqs. Z1. ≠ Z4.. The initial data obtained for binding different concentrations of soluble antiRbIgG-HRP Z0.12≠1.2 nM. to RbIgG immobilized on the electrode surface are shown in Fig. 3. The current changes were insignificant with non-specific control BSA electrodes, and the largest current changes occurred with RbIgG-modified electrodes. All the curves were transformed linearly into plots of d Ird t vs. I Zcurrent. with slope yZ k a Co q k d . ZFig. 4.. The slope value, k obs , for each plot was plotted vs. antiRbIgG-HRP concentrations ZFig. 5.. The respective association and dissociation rate constants were determined from the data of Fig. 5 as 1.3 = 10 6 My1 sy1 and

The quantitative information obtained from the initial rate analysis as described above can be used for the selection of different antibodies to characterize the binding sites and the steric and allosteric effects of biomolecules. 3.2. Differential recognition of calmodulin≠target protein complexes by an anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody The ability of the one-step electrochemical immunosensors to follow protein≠protein interactions was further extended to investigate calmodulin binding its target peptides and proteins using anti-calmodulin mAbs. Specifically, we questioned whether different target peptides and proteins bind to the same or to different binding sites on the calmodulin molecule. The formation of calmodulin≠ target protein complexes was monitored using specific

mAbs ZCAM1 and CAM4. w22x. CAM1 and CAM4 recognize distinct epitopes on the calmodulin molecule located in the C- and N-termini, respectively w22x. As known, the interaction of calmodulin with most of its target proteins is Ca2q-dependent w21x. Therefore, the enzyme-channeling immunoassay was carried out in the presence of Ca2q ions or in its absence Zin the presence of EGTA.. The steps of sequential activation of a target protein and enzyme-channeling immunoassay configuration are presented in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 7, the interaction of mAb CAM1 with calmodulin was highly dependent on Ca2q ions. The interaction of mAb CAM1 with calmodulin decreased upon removal of Ca2q ions. We found that complexation of calmodulin with some of its target proteins or peptides, such as phosphodiesterase, melittin, or calcineurin, interfered with its recognition by mAb CAM1 ZFig. 8, curves 1≠3. suggesting the close location between the binding sites of these ligands with the antibody epitope. In contrast, the complex of calmodulin with mastoparan did not affect the binding of the mAb CAM1 ZFig. 8, curve 4., however, it interfered with the recognition of mAbs CAM4. The complex of calmodulin with calcineurin was recognized ZFig. 9, curve 4. in the presence of mAb CAM4 ZFig. 9, curve 1..

4. Conclusions The determination of antibody≠antigen affinity constants and binding kinetics in real-time is important for the selection of different antibodies, for characterizing binding sites and steric and allosteric effects. We have investigated the possibility of using a new amperometric enzyme-channeling immunosensor to estimate the kinetic constants of antiRbIgG and to study the location of binding site of calmodulin with target proteins. Binding of target proteins to calmodulin seems to occur at various locations on the molecule or after various conformational changes induced by such proteins in CAM molecules. A major advantage of

the enzyme-channeling immunosensor is that it allows the direct monitoring of immunological reactions without washing and separation stages in real-time. This approach requires no costly equipment, only microgram amounts of antibody and antigen, and the measurement of the kinetics of biospecific interaction can be observed for an extended period of time. The amperometric immunosensor with a stirred cell has certain advantages over the micro-fluids system because the kinetics of antigen≠antibody interactions are monitored for an extended period and are not restricted to a few minutes, as in the micro-fluids system. The immunosensor may be used as a tool for different biotechnological applications that are based on biospecific interactions, as well as for determining the concentration of molecules, identifying inhibitors, and screening for drugs.
