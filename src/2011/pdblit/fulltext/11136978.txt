Activation of Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase by Ras
Sabine Suire, Phillip Hawkins, and Len Stephens1 Inositide Laboratory The Babraham Institute Babraham CB2 4AT Cambridge United Kingdom the inositol ring to produce phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. This latter accumulates in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and initiates a cascade of downstream signals by causing membrane recruitment of proteins that bind specifically the distinctive head group of this phosphoinositide [3]. There are two types of class I PI3Ks, both of which are heterodimeric molecules composed of a p110 catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. The class IA enzymes contain a p110 , , or catalytic subunit and an SH2 domain-containing adaptor subunit, p85 , p85 , or p55 , derived from three possible genes (or their splice variants). Class IA can be activated directly by the association of the SH2 domains of their regulatory subunits with appropriate phosphotyrosines, often located in the cytoplasmic tail of receptor tyrosine kinases [4]. Class IB contains only one member, PI3K , that is composed of a p101 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit. This enzyme is regulated by G subunits liberated upon activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. The p101 regulatory subunit is critical for G -activated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production [5, 6]. All class I PI3Ks have a region that is similar to the Ras binding domain (RBD) present in proteins that are regulated by the monomeric GTPase Ras. Furthermore, all class I PI3Ks bind Ras in a GTPdependent manner [7­9]. The Ras family operates in diverse signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and survival. They function as molecular switches by cycling between the inactive GDP-bound state and the active GTP-bound state. The exchange of GDP to GTP causes two regions, switch I and switch II, to change conformation, allowing Ras to bind and activate multiple downstream effectors. Most Ras-dependent signaling is mediated by three downstream effectors: the protein kinase Raf, the exchange factor RalGDS, and PI3Ks [10]. Within the class I PI3Ks, the activation of PI3K by Ras has been the most studied [11, 7, 8]. In vitro, Ras activation of type IA PI3K is synergistic with the stimulation by tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide. In PC12 cells, the action of NGF and EGF on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production is reduced by a dominant-negative Ras mutant [7]. Direct interaction of Ras with PI3K stimulated actin rearrangement and inhibited programmed cell death upon detachment from the extracellular matrix [12]. Other consequences of Ras activation of PI3Ks include cell transformation [13], T cell adhesion and migration [14], and blocking of apoptosis induced by c-Myc [15] or by NGF deprivation [16]. We have previously reported the strong and direct activation of PI3K by H-Ras in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, crystal structures revealed a direct interaction of Ras with the COOH-terminal part of the catalytic domain of p110 and a difference in the conformation of the catalytic domain between p110 and Ras:p110 [17]. However, the exact mechanism involved in the activation of PI3K by Ras has not yet been elucidated. Here, we describe the characterization of two distinct in vitro assays of Ras-dependent activation of PI3K

Summary Background: Type I phosphoinositide 3-kinases are responsible for the hormone-sensitive synthesis of the lipid messenger phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Type IA and IB subfamily members contain a Ras binding domain and are stimulated by activated Ras proteins both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism of Ras activation of type I PI3Ks is unknown, in part because no robust in vitro assay of this event has been established and characterized. Other Ras effectors, such as Raf and phosphoinositide-phospholipase C , have been shown to be translocated into the plasma membrane, leading to their activation. Results: We show that posttranslationally lipid-modified, activated N-, H-, K-, and R-Ras proteins can potently and substantially activate PI3K when using a stripped neutrophil membrane fraction as a source of phospholipid substrate. We have found GTP S-loaded Ras can significantly (6- to 8-fold) activate PI3K when using artificial phospholipid vesicles containing their substrate, and this effect is a result of both a decrease in apparent Km for phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate and an increase in the apparent Vmax. However, neither in vivo nor in the two in vitro assays of Ras activation of PI3K could we detect any evidence of a Ras-dependent translocation of PI3K to its source of phospholipid substrate. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Ras activate PI3K at the level of the membrane, by allosteric modulation and/or reorientation of the PI3K , implying that Ras can activate PI3K without its membrane translocation. This view is supported by structural work that has suggested binding of Ras to PI3K results in a change in the structure of the catalytic pocket. Introduction Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity plays a central role in cell signaling and can lead to cell proliferation, survival, motility, exocytosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangements as well as specialized cell responses, such as superoxide production and cardiac myocyte growth [1­2]. Mammalian PI3Ks are divided into three classes based on their structure and substrate specificity. Upon activation by cell surface receptors, class I PI3Ks phosphorylate preferentially phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] on the D3 position of

Figure 1. Activation of PI3K by Ras In Vitro Activation of PI3K by posttranslationally modified H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, and R-Ras, using pig neutrophils membranes as a substrate. The final concentration of the Ras (corrected for the proportion that inserted into the membranes and could bind GTP) and PI3K were 15 and 30 nM, respectively. They were incubated with [ 32P]-ATP and a neutrophil membrane fraction for 3 min. The assays were stopped and [32P]-labeled phosphoinositides were extracted, deacylated, separated by HPLC, and quantified by scintillation counting. The data for [32P]-PtdIns(3)P [PI(3)P], [32P]-PtdIns(3,4)P2 [PI(3,4)P2], and [32P]-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 [PI(3,4,5)P3] are shown. The data shown are from a representative experiment (of two to three experiments) and were normalized via the [32P]-PtdIns(4)P produced during the assay.

that we use, in parallel with experiments utilizing intact cells, to address the mechanism by which Ras proteins activate PI3K . Results All GTP-Ras Isoforms Activate PI3K To determine the activation of PI3K by the different Ras isoforms (H-, N-, K-) and their close relative R-Ras, we investigated the effect of full-length lipid-modified GDP or GTP S-loaded Ras on PI3K activity in vitro. The assays used a plasma membrane-enriched membrane fraction from neutrophils as a source of lipid substrates. Our results showed that all GTP S-loaded Ras isoforms activated PI3K (Figure 1). With approximately 15 nM Ras proteins (corrected for both GTP S binding and the proportion of the Ras proteins inserted into the neutrophils membranes in the assays), a 30-fold increase of PI3K activity was observed with R-Ras and K-Ras, whereas, in the presence of H-Ras and N-Ras, a 10-fold increase was measured. These activations were strictly GTP S dependent; no stimulation was found with the relevant GDP-loaded Ras proteins. R-Ras and K-Ras Are More Potent Activators than H-Ras and N-Ras To investigate the differences among the Ras isoforms' abilities to activate PI3K , a large range of Ras concentrations from 0.5 nM to 250 nM was tested (Figure 2). Again, these data were corrected for both the GTP S binding and the extent of membrane insertion shown by each Ras protein. At Ras concentrations below 10 nM, the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 stimulated by R-Ras and K-Ras was ten times higher than that with H- and N-Ras, demonstrating that at lower concentrations R-Ras and K-Ras are more potent activators of PI3K than H-Ras and N-Ras. With H-Ras and N-Ras, we were limited by the final percent cholate we could accommodate in the assays and the relatively low concentration of the H- and N-Ras stocks to a maximum final concentration of 100 nM and 50 nM, respectively. In all of the above experiments, we also quantified

PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns3P accumulation; these data closely paralleled results with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. PI3K Activation Dependent on Ras Lipid Modification All of the above work used Sf9-derived Ras proteins purified via a Triton X114 extraction procedure (that does not recover Ras proteins without lipid modifications). These lipid-modified Ras proteins all inserted substantially into the membranes used in our in vitro assays (20%­40%, depending on the Ras isoforms, see Figure 6 and below). To see whether membrane localization of Ras was required to enable activation of PI3K , we tested the ability of bacterially produced, nonmodified H-Ras to activate PI3K on neutrophil membranes in a assay of the above format (Figure 3). Unmodified GTP S-Hras was able to bind p110 (data not shown, see [17]) and significantly activated PI3K , but in terms of fold above GDP-loaded control, the effect was reduced by more than 10-fold, and similarly, the absolute levels of activity were also substantially reduced compared to Sf9-derived H-Ras. Ras Activation of PI3K in Stripped Neutrophil Membranes To investigate whether the action of Ras on PI3K activity in the neutrophil membranes was mediated by an additional protein, we stripped the membranes of weakly and strongly associated proteins by washing them with urea (2.5 M) or high (1 M NaCl) or low (2.5 mM HEPES) salt buffers and then assayed PI3K activation in the presence of H-Ras, using the protocol described before. None of the membrane treatments reduced the fold activation of PI3K activity by H-Ras (Figure 4). Ras-Dependent Activation of PI3K on Mixed Phospholipid Liposomes We prepared liposomes containing phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol, in proportions similar to those thought to be present in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, with various concentrations of phos-

Figure 2. K-Ras and R-Ras Are More Potent Activators of PI3K than H-Ras and N-Ras In Vitro Activation of PI3K by posttranslationally modified H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, and R-Ras, using pig neutrophils membranes as a substrate. A large range of Ras concentrations (corrected as in Figure 1) was used in the presence of 30 nM PI3K . Samples were processed and quantified as described in Figure 1.

phatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2, 1 M to 100 M] (Figure 5). As expected, PI3K phosphorylated the PtdIns(4,5)P2 in these liposomes. Ras proteins efficiently inserted into these liposomes (see below). In the presence of 50 M PtdIns(4,5)P2 (apparently saturating for PI3K ), GTP S-Rras but not GDP-Rras caused a 2-fold increase in PI3K activity. This effect was substantially greater at lower PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentrations, suggesting that the GTP S-Rras was acting to increase the apparent affinity of PI3K for PtdIns(4,5)P2. Ras Does Not Drive Membrane Translocation of PI3K Either In Vivo or In Vitro To examine whether the mechanism of Ras activation of PI3K was dependent of PI3K translocation, we coexpressed p101, p110 , and different H-Ras alleles in Cos-7 cells, and we determined their distribution in the membrane and cytosolic fractions after serum starvation (Figure 6A). About 10% of PI3K was found in the membrane fraction in the absence of heterologous

Ras; this proportion did not change when it was coexpressed with H-RasG12V, a constitutive-active mutant, and H-RasN17S, a dominant-inhibitory mutant. We have published the results of precisely parallel experiments in which we measured the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, that showed under these conditions heterologous H-RasG12V stimulated a 20- to 30-fold increase in heterologous PI3K activity [17]. We then examined the distribution of PI3K between centrifugation-generated pellets and supernatants in in vitro assays using neutrophil membrane fractions in which we can measure substantial activation of PI3K by Ras proteins. We found 5%­8% of PI3K was associated with the neutrophil membranes in the absence of added Ras proteins. Although 20%­40% of the added, Sf9-derived Ras proteins inserted into the membranes, neither GDP- nor GTP S-loaded K-Ras (Figure 6B) or H-Ras (data not shown) caused significant change in the amount of PI3K bound to the membranes. We conducted similar experiments to assess the dis-

Effects of Dissociating Proteins from the Substrate Membranes on the Ability of Ras to Activate PI3K Activation of PI3K (30 nM final concentration) by posttranslationally modified H-Ras (15 nM final concentration, corrected as in Figure 1), using treated pig neutrophil membranes as a substrate. The pig neutrophil membranes were pretreated with 2.5 M urea (2.5 M urea, 1 mM KCl) or low salt (2.5 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT) or high salt (1 M NaCl) and then washed three times with the control buffer (0.12 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 1 mM DTT). Assays were conducted and analyzed and quantified as described in Figure 1 (except data were normalized to the average [32P]-PtdIns(4)P produced in membranes extracted by a particular procedure; see Experimental Procedures).

Effect of Ras on PI3K Activity Using Mixed Phospholipid Vesicles as a Substrate Activation of PI3K (3 nM final concentration) by posttranslationally modified Rras (20 nM final concentration), using lipid vesicles as a substrate. The final lipid concentrations in the assay were 60 M phosphatidylserine, 125 M phosphatidylcholine, 125 M phosphatidylethanolamine, 20 M sphingomyelin, 125 M cholesterol, and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2, 1 M to 100 M]. After 3 min incubation with [ 32P]-ATP, the assays were stopped, and the total [32P] recovered in a lipid extract (above a no PI3K control) was quantified by scintillation counting. (A) Results are plotted as disintegration per minute (dpm) of lipid product against the concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 for PI3K with or without GTP S or GDP-loaded R-Ras.

Figure 6. Impact of Ras on the Distribution of PI3K in Cos-7 Cells and Neutrophil Membranes (A) Cos-7 cells expressing the indicated proteins were subjected to serum starvation for 18 hr and then lysed by sonication. Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined, and equivalent amounts of proteins were loaded on to a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto PDVF, and immunoblotted for PI3K and Ras. The results are from a single experiment (representative of two). The left part of the figure represents the total fraction (membrane and cytosol), and the right part represents the content of the membrane alone. About 2% of the total fraction and all the membrane fraction were used. (B) Neutrophil membranes were incubated with GDP-Kras or GTP S-Kras for 15 min on ice. After this time, PI3K was added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 C. After 3 min, the reactions were quenched and spun for 20 min at 13,000 g. Half of the supernatant and the all pellet were loaded onto a SDSPAGE gel, transferred onto PDVF, and immunoblotted for PI3K and Ras. The results are from a single experiment (representative of two).

tribution of PI3K within assays containing synthetic, mixed, sucrose-loaded phospholipid vesicles (like those studying the effects of G on PI3K activation [18]). Neither GDP- nor GTP S-loaded Ras significantly increased the amount of PI3K associated with the vesicles (data not shown). Discussion We have shown previously that H-Ras can activate PI3K directly both in vivo and in vitro [17]. Here, we have demonstrated that N-Ras, H-Ras, K-Ras, and RRas can stimulate the PI3K activity in vitro using neutrophil membranes as a source of substrate. The ability of this membrane fraction to support Ras-dependent activation of PI3K was resistant to stringent proteinstripping protocols, including washing with 2.5 M urea, suggesting that nonintegral membrane proteins are not essential. However, there are marked differences in the activation of PI3K by the different Ras isoforms, such that K-Ras and R-Ras are more potent activators of PI3K than H-Ras and N-Ras. This was not a result of a difference in the ability of the Ras proteins to insert into the membranes, as we corrected these data for the amount of the Ras proteins that became membrane associated in these assays. H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras have a high degree of sequence homology ( 90%) and share exactly the same effector binding domain as well as the specificity domain that surrounds it [19]. R-Ras forms a distinct branch of the Ras subfamily and is 55% identical to H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras. Its minimal effector region is identical to the

Ras isoforms, but its insertion mode within the plasma membrane is still uncertain. However, previous results have demonstrated that R-Ras can activate PI3K in vivo [20]. The hypervariable region (HVR) in Ras proteins, located in the 25 C-terminal amino acids, is the only region where the highly homologous H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras substantially differ from each other and could hence explain the differential activation of PI3K . The HVR contains two signal sequences that promote association with the plasma membrane by rendering them more hydrophobic. The first signal is a CAAX box where each of the Ras proteins becomes farnesylated, truncated, and carboxymethylated. The second signal sequence consists of a polybasic stretch of six lysines in K-Ras or a single or double palmitoylation in N-Ras or H-Ras, respectively. Both signals are required to localize the Ras isoforms to the plasma membrane [21]. We find that Ras requires posttranslational lipid modification to fully activate p110 , although they are not required for Ras:p110 binding [17]. This result confirms similar work describing Ras-dependent activation of p110 in vitro [8]. The lipid modification of Ras proteins allows them to insert into the neutrophil membranes or liposomes used in our assays. This insertion process effectively substantially increases the local concentration of Ras in the membrane phase where the PI3K is active. The increased local concentrations of Ras in the membrane may be the sole reason for the difference between the bacterial and Sf9-derived Ras proteins. However, it is additionally and/or alternatively possible that in the membrane Ras makes an important and activating con-

tribution to the orientation of PI3K at the interphase, which is dependent on the Ras being lipid modified. Contiguous, biological, phospholipid bilayer-based membranes are now seen as complex structures that can contain quite distinct domains of widely varying size and with different lipid and protein compositions. Lipid rafts and caveolae (characteristically containing the protein caveolin) are empirically defined microdomains of the plasma membrane that appear to be rich in sphingolipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. It is clear that a number of the key players in the signaling cassettes relevant here are targeted in or out of these microdomains. GDP-H-ras [22­25], receptor- (e.g., PDGF receptor and EGF receptor) and Src-type tyrosine kinases [26, 27], PtdIns(4,5)P2 (about 50% of the total [28]), and G subunits [27, 29] are known to be concentrated, whereas G subunits [29] and K-Ras [22, 23, 25] are preferentially scarce, in cholesterol-rich, detergentresistant microdomains. The factors which determine these distributions are not fully resolved, but in the case of the Ras proteins, their covalent lipid modifications are very important. These observations may explain several features of our results and their relationship to other published work. It has been reported, in apparent disagreement with our work, that H-Ras was better than K-Ras at activating type IA PI3Ks [30]. This may be a result of the differential partitioning of type IA PI3Ks into microdomains enriched with receptor tyrosine kinases which can activate them, where H-Ras but not K-Ras is also concentrated. In contrast, PI3K may differentially partition into the bulk membrane, where G s and K-Ras are concentrated, hence explaining why K-Ras is a better activator of PI3K than H-Ras. The polybasic region in K-Ras, in comparison to the palmitoyl moieties in H-Ras and N-Ras, may be able to allow better association with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the bilayer, hence counteracting the fact that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is concentrated into cholesterol-rich microdomains. Perhaps this ability of the polybasic domain to improve the colocalization of Ras proteins with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and therefore for them to act as better activators of PI3Ks explains the recent report that switching the farnesyl group of H-Ras for polybasic motif improved its ability to activate type IA PI3Ks [31]. We present data that show that in three very distinct contexts both in vitro and in vivo, where we can demonstrate clear GTP- or GTP S-Ras-dependent activation of PI3K , we can detect no Ras-driven redistribution of PI3K . The implication of these results is that Ras activates PI3K at the level of the membrane either via classical allosteric mechanism or by altering the orientation of the PI3K within the surface of the membrane with respect to its phospholipids substrates. This contrasts with works showing a translocation of PLC or Raf kinase into the plasma membrane caused by activation [32, 33]. Some work suggests PI3Ks can be activated, as a result of improved access to their substrate phospholipids, by translocation to the plasma membrane. This is presumed to apply in the case of type IA PI3Ks that have been demonstrated to translocate to activated receptor tyrosine kinases in the plasma membrane, because substantial increases in the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can result, and yet in vitro studies suggest relatively small

changes (4- to 5-fold) in PI3K activity result directly from SH2:phosphotyrosine docking [34, 35]. Moreover, substantial evidence indicates that artificially targetting both type IA and B PI3Ks to the plasma membrane leads to their constitutive activation (although these events have not been demonstrated to be dependent purely on improved access to substrate lipids rather than improved activation by proteins like Ras, it is very likely to be the case). These observations show that PI3Ks can be activated by translocation, but they do not mean type I PI3Ks cannot be further activated once at the level of the membrane [36]. We have also studied the mechanism by which G s activate p110 and similarly concluded that in in vitro assays, where we could detect substantial G -elicited changes in PI3K activity, we could find no evidence of translocation [18]. Interestingly, structural studies have revealed changes in the conformation of the catalytic site of p110 are driven by binding of Ras. Although the RBD of p110 is relatively distant from the catalytic domain, particularly when viewed at the level of its primary structure, direct contacts between the switch II region of the effector domain of Ras and the COOH-terminal part of the catalytic domain have been observed and may underlie the ability of Ras to allosterically activate PI3K . Finally, we report that the activation of PI3K by Ras which occurs at the level of the membrane is based on two events. First, a decrease in the apparent Km of PI3K for PtdIns(4,5)P2, and second, by a change in Vmax and/or apparent Km for ATP. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a change in the apparent Km of a PI3K for its phospholipid substrate in response to an activator. This event may explain why other workers, using saturating concentrations of phosphoinositide substrates, have failed to detect Ras-dependent activation of type I PI3Ks in vitro or have only detected clear effects in the context of other activators. Furthermore, this may be at least part of the explanation for why we can detect substantial effects of Ras on PI3K activity in the context of neutrophil-derived membranes. There is good evidence that the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane fall rapidly subsequent to cell disruption and moreover that much of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 in cellular membranes is bound tightly to proteins, tending to lower its effective free concentration. However, there is still a significant discrepancy between the scale of activation of PI3K by Ras in the context of liposomes with low PtdIns(4,5)P2 (at best, 8- to 10-fold) compared to what we see in the context of stripped, neutrophilderived membrane fractions (up to 50-fold).
Experimental Procedures Production of Recombinant Protein Posttranslationally modified H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, and R-Ras were obtained by infecting Sf9 cells with a baculovirus encoding the relevant EE-tagged Ras and purified via Triton X114 phase partioning. They were then EE-directed immunoprecipitated as described [17] and stored at 80 C in a buffer containing 1% sodium cholate, 10 M GDP, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and eluting peptide (150 g/ml) at approximately 2­3 mg/ml. Nonmodified H-ras was prepared as described [5]. PI3K was obtained by coinfecting Sf9 cells with baculovirus encoding His-tagged p110 and EEtagged p101 and purified via EE-tag [5].

In Vitro Activity Measurements All Ras isoforms were loaded with GTP S or GDP by incubation with a 10-fold molar excess of the relevant nucleotide in 5 mM EDTA/5 mM MgCl2. After 15 min at 20 C, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the proteins were frozen at 80 C (care was taken to ensure these maneuvers did not significantly change the pH of the solution). To assess the active concentration of Ras, all Ras isoforms were diluted in 5 mM MgCl2, 1% cholate, 0.12 M NaCl, 40 mM HEPES, and 1 mM DTT. Then 2 l were incubated in 5 l assay buffer (containing 0.12 M NaCl, 40 mM HEPES, 1% cholate, 2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT) and 2.2 l of GTP buffer (containing 0.12 M NaCl, 40 mM HEPES, 5 mM EGTA with cold and [35S]-GTP S at a final concentration of 10 M). After incubation at 20 C for 15 min, 5 ml of Stop buffer (containing 0.12 M NaCl, 40 mM HEPES, 0.12 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT) was added. The mixture was then applied onto a nitrocellulose filter (HA, 0.45 M) and washed two times. The residual radioactivity on the filter was measured by scintillation counting, and controls without Ras were used to estimate nonspecific binding. Pig neutrophil light membrane fractions were prepared as described in [37]. Assays were carried out by incubating neutrophil membranes (5 g protein) with GTP S or GDP-loaded posttranslationally modified Ras or unmodified H-Ras in a buffer containing 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5 at 5 C), and 1 mM DTT on ice. After an incubation of 15 min, 1 l PI3K (30 ng) was added. After an additional 2 min, buffer containing [ 32P]ATP (20 Ci per assay with a final ATP concentration of 200 M with 1.26 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KCl, 320 mM HEPES [pH 7.5, 5 C], 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA) was added, and the reactions were transferred to 30 C. After 3 min, the assays were quenched, and the lipids were extracted, deacylated, analyzed by HPLC, and quantified as described previously [5]. Data were normalized via the amount of [32P]PtdIns(4)P produced by membrane-associated kinases (Figures 1­4; in Figures 1­3, the average [32P]-PtdIns(4)P produced per assay in the whole experiments was used as a reference point; in Figure 4, the average amount of [32P]-PtdIns(4)P produced within a single extraction protocol was used as the reference point). Over many experiments, Ras has no effect on [32P]-PtdIns(4)P formation in these assays. For liposome-based reconstitution assays, liposomes were made by sonication of the vacuum-dried lipids into a buffer containing 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), and 1 mM DTT. For the sucrose-loaded vesicles, the solution was identical except it contained 5 mM KCl and 0.19 M sucrose. The final lipid concentration in the assay was 60 M phosphatidylserine, 125 M phosphatidylcholine, 125 M phosphatidylethanolamine, 20 M sphingomyelin, 125 M cholesterol, with various concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 from a range of 1 M to 100 M. For the assays, 5 l of freshly sonicated liposomes were added to 4 l of assay buffer (0.1 M KCl, 3.75 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 0.01% azide, 1 mM DTT) and 1 l R-Ras (diluted in buffer with 1% cholate, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 M KCl, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5] for a final concentration of 70 nM) and incubated on ice. After 15 min, 2 l PI3K (diluted in 0.1 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2 for a final concentration of 3nM) and 5 l buffer containing [ 32P]ATP (20 Ci per assay with a final ATP concentration of 200 M with 1.26 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KCl, 320 mM HEPES [pH 7.5, 5 C], 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA) was added, and the reactions were transferred to 30 C. After 3 min, the assays were either quenched by 140 l of 1.45 M HCl and the [32P] PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was extracted and the radioactivity quantified or, alternatively, centrifuged to determine the distribution of Ras or PI3K components. To determine the distribution of Ras and PI3K in these assays, after 3 min at 30 C, the samples were cooled and diluted with 40 l of cold assay buffer and immediately centrifugated to derive supernatant and pellet, which were analyzed by immunoblotting. The protein that sedimented in the absence of membranes was assumed to be aggregated and not correctly inserted into the membranes. Intracellular Localization Cos-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA (10 g of full-length P110 , 10 g of myc-tagged p101, 10 g of H-RasG12V or H-RasN17S

or irrelevant control DNA for a total of 30 g/transfection) in a final volume of 0.5 ml as described previously [5]. After electroporation, the cells were plated in 15 cm diameter dishes and incubated for 28 hr in complete growth medium (DMEM with 10% v/v FBS), washed, and then incubated in HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 1 mM NaHCO3 and 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (starvation medium). After 18 hr, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and collected in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors--see above) and lysed by sonication. The lysates were separated into the membranes and the cytosolic fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 hr at 4 C. P110 and Ras were detected in the membrane and cytosolic fractions by a rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-199, Santa Cruz) and a mouse pan-Ras monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products), respectively.
