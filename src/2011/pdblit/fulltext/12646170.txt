SUMMARY: We present spectroscopic evidence for an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) probe to detect local Z-DNA conformations in synthetic DNA. A spin labeled deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate (pppDCAT) was co-polymerized with Micrococcus Zuteus DNA poIymerase to yield the spin active aiternating co-polymer (dG-dC,DCAT),. The EPR spectrum of (dG-dC,DCAT), in the Z-DNA conformation indicates a decrease in the local base dynamics by about a factor of two as compared to that computed for B-DNA. A control experiment conducted with (dA-dT, DUAT), under similar salt conditions rules out the possibilty of observing salt induced artifacts. 01990 Academic Press, Inc.

The past decade has been prolific with research focused on identifying and characterizing unusual DNA structures and on ascertaining their invoIvement in cellular processes. Z-DNA has received considerable scientific attention since the first crystallographic evidence for this left-handed helix was published (1,2). Recent studies seem also to suggest the existence of Z-DNA in living cells (3). A few of the many recent approaches to studying Z-DNA have included, enzymatic methylation by DNA methyltransferase (41, specific photo-crosslinking with trimethylpsoralen (51, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (61, and Z-DNA specific monoclonal antibodies (7). Also, several spectroscopic methods, such as NMR (81, circular dichroism (91, and Raman (lo), have been used. Each Z-DNA probing technique has its limitations. The chemical and enzymatic Z-DNA assays are usually not effective beyond target molecule detection, because the binding perturbs the nucleic acid structure; NMR is limited to small oligomers; Raman, circular dichroism, and other non-invasive techniques provide only global information, thereby limiting their use of studying Z-DNA in cellular systems. *To whom correspondence shouId be addressed.

Here we describe an alternate approach to detecting the presence of local ZDNA conformation. It is based on the enzymatic incorporation of deoxycytidine, substituted in the C-5 position with a tethered nitroxide, into an alternating dCG segment, and subsequent measurement of the labeled DNA by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). A characteristic EPR lineshape change is observed when the DNA undergoes a B to Z transition. The change is analyzed with modern EPR theory in terms of a single model of molecular dynamics, and we conclude that the local base dynamics is reduced by about a factor of two in Z-DNA as compared to B-DNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS

General. Micrococcus Zuteus DNA olymerase was purchased from ICN Biochemicals, and (dI-dC&, unmodified nut Peotide triphosphates and Sephacryl S200 from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology. NaCl (99.999% urity) was bought from Alpha Products, and dithiothreitol and cacodylic acid from 8 igma Chemical Co. All other chemicals (reagent grade or higher) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co., J.T. Baker Chemical Co., Fisher Scientific, or Kodak. (dA-dT,DUAT), (11) and pppDCAT (121 were synthesized as reported earlier. Experimental and simulated EPR spectra. Spectra were obtained on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer outfitted with a Bruker TM110 cavity. Modulation amplitude and time constant were 1.6 G and 163 ms, respectively, and the microwave power was set below saturation of the samples at 30 mW. Simulations of the EPR spectra were carried out with a tilt program used by Polnaszek (13). It was applied to the same motional model described earlier (141, which hereafter is referred to as the fFnytonal model. For the simulations, the ftllowing parameters were used: T/J = I = 4 ns, T2-1 = 0.8 G, tilt angle = 50 for B form (dG-dC,DCAT),; t// = 0.2 n's, -cl' = 7 ns, Tz.1 = 0.8 G, tilt angle = 40" for Z form (dG-dC,DCAT).. Molecular Modeling. This was achieved on an Evans & Sutherland PS390 Computer Graphics System using coordinates from the Brookhaven data bank for Band Z-DNA. The label DCAT was constructed in its extended conformation without energy minimization calculations. (dG-dC,DCAT),,, synthesis and purification. By a procedural modification of the method described for (dA-dT,DUAT), (111, the polymerizations (65Opl) were carried out in polypropylene tubes containing the following components: H20, 380 pl; KH2P04 0.8 M (pH 7.5), 50 pl; dithiothreitol 1.25 mM, 50 pl; dCTP 6 mM (0.15 pmol), 25 pl; pppDCAT 6 mM (0.15 pmol), 25 pl; dGTP 6 mM (0.3 pmol), 50 pl; (dIdC1, at 0.05 OD251nm/u1 in Hz0 (36 nmol), 5 pl; MgC12 76 mM, 50 pl; M. lutew DNA polymerase at 1 unit/p1 buffered in 0.1 M NaCl, 1.5 mM NazEDTA, 0.2 M KH2P04 pH 7.5, and 50% Glycerin (v/v), 15 pl. After a 10 to 12 hour incubation at 37°C the reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 pl 3 M NaCV0.045 M Na2EDTA. Deproteinization was carried out in 3 ml glass tubes by extraction with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (5:2 v/v). After centrifugation at 175Oxg, the aqueous DNA-containing layer was drawn off and transferred to another glass tube. The extraction procedure was repeated 4 times before separating the spin labeled polymers from the unincorporated building blocks b size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column (36 cm x 1.6 cm) elute ir with 0.04 M NH4HC03, pH 7.5. The typical yield of a pol erization reaction is about 75 nmol, and the percentage of DCAT incorporation is or the order of 0.5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The spin labeled deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine triphosphates pppDCAT and pppDUAT, containing identical tethers and nitroxide moieties, are shown in Figure

1. The nucleotide analogs were enzymatically incorporated to yield the respective spin labeled alternating copolymers (dG-dC,DCAT), and (dA-dT,DUAT),. Spectra A and B of Figure 2 are the experimental EPR traces of (dG-dC,DCAT), in high and low ionic strength buffer, respectively. The high salt condition, previously used for Z-DNA dynamics studies of (dG-dC)n by NMR (15), gives rise to a previously unobserved EPR spectrum, which is significantly different from the one reported in low salt buffer, while spectrum B has a lineshape characteristic for BDNA containing dU or dC residues substituted in position 5 with such tethered nitroxides. A control experiment was carried out with the labeled alternating copolymer (dA-dT,DUAT), to prove that the discovered effect is nucleic acid conformation dependent, and not just a salt effect on the relaxation process of the nitroxide moiety. It is known that (dA-dT), will not undergo a B to Z transition upon increasing the solution's NaCl concentration to 4.5 M. As can be seen from spectra C and D in Figure 2, the spectra of (dA-dT,DUAT), are essentially the same under high and low salt conditions. Thus, spectrum A reflects the EPR signature for Z-DNA with DCAT as probe. EPR spectral simulations A and B of Figure 2 approximate the experimental EPR data of (dG-dC,DCAT),. With the exception of a slight tilt angle variation, identical parameters are used to simulate dC and dT motions of their corresponding alternating copolymers in the B-conformation (11). The disc motional model (see

Materials and Methods), with its two characteristic rotational correlation times, has been applied to over 40 different spin labeled nucleic acid systems to evaluate structural and motional features of RNA and DNA systems (11,12,14,15). The faster of the correlation times, t/l, is tether dependent, less than 1 ns, and attributed to The larger correlation time, TV, is nitroxide motion independent of base motion. ascribed to base motion. For instance, in B-DNA a constant value of about 4 ns is derived for base motion. This value is in good agreement with several NMR studies (16-181, but in disagreement with some others (19,20). With the disc model, which contrasts the cylindrical model used with rigidly tethered probes (21), one does not have to take into consideration the global tumbling of the macromolecule, since we observed repeatedly that the EPR spectra of nitroxides with this type of tether are independent of the size of the macromolecule. This was again recently confirmed, when we reported essentially the same EPR spectrum for DUAT incorporated either in a 26mer or in the polymer (dA-dT,DUAT), (22). Additional support for the disc model comes from the present study on (dGdC,DCAT), in its B-DNA and Z-DNA conformations. The control experiment with (dA-dT,DUAT), rules out the possibility of some salt artifact being responsible for the broadening of the spectrum. Also, the possibility that DCAT and DUAT, with their same tether of intermediate rigidity, simply reflect probe motion independent of base dynamics is inconsistent with molecular modeling studies. Namely, the Kendrew-stick models of the label position dependence on helical conformation. A B-Z Figure 3 illustrate transition causes the tethered nitroxides, attached in position 5 of deoxycytidine, to

rotate from the major groove of the B-DNA (left) to the exterior surface of the Z-helix (right). CPK representations of the same DNA structures (not shown) further illustrate the sterically crowded and open environments surrounding the spin probe in B- and Z-DNA, respectively. Thus, should the labels move independently of the base, it would be expected that the mobility of the nitroxide would increase after a B to Z transition, since the probe is in a less hindered environment in Z-DNA than in BDNA. On the other hand, if the tethered nitroxide is coupled to the base, as postulated with the disc motional model, then the probe will reflect some of the base dynamics. Based upon computer simulation with the above defined motional model, the value for TV is determined to be 7 ns for the base dynamics in Z-DNA, which is about a factor of 2 larger than the 4 ns reported earlier for the base dynamics in BDNA. Rather elaborate interpretations of the NMR data of (dC-dG), suggested similar rapid internal motions (amplitudes and rates) in both B- and Z-DNAs, although the slower conformational fluctuations resulting in exchange of the imino protons were believed to be different for the B and Z conformations (15). Our results are based on a straightforward interpretation of the EPR data in the presence of proper control experiments which seem to qualitatively agree with light scattering studies. Namely, it was concluded that the duplex is stiffer in the Z form than in the B form because the persistence length of the Z form of (dC-dG)n was found to be 200 nm, whereas that of the B form was about 2+ times smaller (23). The local base dynamic difference between both forms could play an important role in the specificity of proteins binding to nucleic acids, which may involve the direct interaction between DNA bases and amino acids. As was already pointed out earlier (15), the occurrence of rapid internal motions is of interest with respect to the importance of particular conformational states in the protein-nucleic acid recognition process. One might expect the DNA to assume many different conformational states on a nanosecond time scale. The reduced local base dynamics in Z DNA may be intimately involved in the specific recognition and binding of some proteins. Acknowledgments: This work was in part su ported by NIH grant GM27002.
