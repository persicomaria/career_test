The crystal structure of the complex between adenylate kinase from bovine mitochondrial matrix and its substrate AMP has been refined at 1.85 A resolution (1 A = @l nm). Based on 42,519 independent reflections of better than 10 L% resolution, a final R-factor of IS-9 y0 was obtained with a model obeying standard geometry within 0.016 a in bond lengths and 3.2" in bond angles. There are two enzyme : substrate complexes in the asymmetric unit, each consisting of 226 amino acid residues, one AMP and one sulfate ion. A superposition of the two full-length polypeptides revealed deviations that can be described as small relative movements of three domains. Best superpositions of individual domains yielded a residual overall root-mean-square deviation of 03 d for the backbone atoms and 0.5 A for the sidechains. The final model contains 381 solvent molecules in the asymmetric unit, 2 x 72 = 144 of which occupy corresponding positions in both complexes.

1. Introduction Adenylate kinase from beef heart mitochondrial matrix (AK3t, GTP : AMP-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.10) is a monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the reaction Mg'+GTP + AMP s Mg'+GDP + ADP (Tomasselli & Noda, 1979; Tomasselli et al., 1979). The enzyme is essential for the biosynthesis of ADP from AMP. The peptide sequence has been reported by Tomasselli et al. (1986). The N terminus is heterogeneous, 33% and 18% of all molecules are shortened by one and two amino acid residues, respectively (Wieland et al., 1984). A cDNA-derived sequence has also been published (Yamada et al., 1989). The sequence homology to other members of the adenylate kinase family ranges between 24% and 37% identical residues (Schulz et al., 1986). Two medium-resolution crystal structures of adenylate kinases (AKyst, AKeeo) with bound twosubstrate-mimicking inhibitor P',P'-bis(adenosine%)pentaphosphate (Ap,A) and one high-resolution crystal structure of an adenylate kinase (AKl)

without substrate have been reported (Egner et al., 1987; Mueller AI Schulz, 1988; Dreusicke et al., 1988). Since AK3 was crystallized with only one of the substrates (AMP) bound, its crystal structure allows us to distinguish between the tri- and monophosphate position of bound ApsA. After reporting the initial X-ray analysis (Diederichs & Schulz, 1990), we now describe the final refined structure at a resolution of 1.85 a (1 L% 0.1 nm). = 2. Methods
The crystal space group is P2,2,2, with 2 enzyme: substrate complexes per asymmetric unit. The unit cell dimensions are 4983 d x 67.99 Ax 15541 ir as derived from the analysis of rotation photographs. A native data set at l&5 A resolution (41,795 reflections) had been collected using the synchrotron source at the EMBL outstation in Hamburg (Diederiehs & Schulz, 1990). After data reduction and merging with diffractometer data measured out to 3 A resolution, a 95% complete data set at, 1.85 A resolution containing 42,869 reflections was produced (Diederichs, 1990) and used in all refinements. The refinement calculations were done with the moliecular dynamics program X-PLOR (Bruenger et al., 1987), 1 cycle of which took up to 4 days of CPU time on our PVAX-II. The first 6 rounds of the refinement resulted in a generally correct model with an R-factor of 2%4%, that has been reported previously (Diederichs & Schulz, 1990). The results of the subsequent refinement are given in Table 1. In round 7 an additional alanine, Ala8, was

and G. E. Schulz Even at this temperature, the dynamics increased she radius of convergence of the refinement appreciably; because in ail rounds the energy minimization following dynamics (min-2) yielded lower R-factors than the one preceding dynamics (min-1). The final R-factor was 18.9% for 42,519 reflections in the resolution range 10 to 1.85 ii. Here, one should keep in mind that the refinement included all measured reflections as observables. The R-factor for the subset of 29,074 reflections with intensities farger than 3 standard deviations is as low as L6-I %. An error estimate for the atomic co-ordinates can be obtained from a Luzzat,i plot (Luzzati, 1952), which assumes that the disagreement between observed and calcula.ted structure factor amplitudes is merely caused by atomic displacements. From Fig. 1, an upper error limit of 0.25 A can be derived for the co-ordinate error. In this Figure we also included the R-factor for the subset of higher intensities, which lowers the error estimate. Another error estimate is available from equivalent solvent positions in the 2 complexes. Two solvent molecules were considered as equivalent or NC&related; if the distance between the 1st solvent molecule and the NCS-transformed position of the 2nd solvent molecule is less than 1 A. Using this criterion and the NCS-relations separately for the domains MAIN; INSERT and AMPbd (Diederichs & Schulz, 1990), we observed 72 pairs of equivalent solvent molecules. The resulting distances were generally below @5 A and the average distance was 0.3 8, although these pairs were not NCS-restrained during the refinement. This v&e a.grees with the r.m.s. main-chain atom distance between complexes no. I and no. 2 after

inserted before Ala9. It improved the fit, of the preceding residues (Leu-Leu-Arg) to the electron density considerably (see Fig. 2). This correction was confirmed by repeating the N-terminal sequence determination of the protein (E. Schiitz, personal communication). Moreover, the additional ala.nine was abo found in the cDNA sequence published recently (Yamada et al., 1989). To stay consistent with previous publications, we decided to start sequence numbering wit,h 0 instead of 1. This accounts somewhat for the inhomogeneous N terminus and it affects only the 8 N-t.erminal residues. Most of the side-chains were positioned correctly after round 7. Minor errors in side-chain orientations, especially for Thr, Val, Leu, Asn, Gin: and His were corrected at later stages. For Asn, Gln and I-Iis and Thr we tried to establish the orientation that maximizes hydrogen bonding and that minimizes temperature factor discrepancies between the respective pairs of C, N and 0 atoms. The orientation of Leu and Val side-chains became unanbiguous for temperature factors below about 30 ip2. Solvent molecules were usually identified in difference Fourier maps, They were added to the model if they were located at hydrogen bonding distance to the protein. If in later rounds the electron density of a solvent molecule dropped below a given threshold of about 80% of the standard deviation of the (2F,,, - F,,,,) electron density map, it was removed from the model. When the R-factor crossed the 20% level at round 17 (Table l), the temperature factors of NCS-relat'ed atoms were no longer restrained, causing another drop of 1.2%. The largest temperature factor differences of NC&related atoms were observed in domain AMPbd (see Fig. 7). As can be seen in Table I, the refinement with X-PI,OR proceeded smoothly. We did not apply molecular dynamics runs at 2000 K as proposed by Bruenger (1988) because the initial model was already generally correct. Instead, we kept, the dynamics temperature at 300 K.

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Main and side-chain conformations As exemplified in Figure 2, the final electron density is of good quality. However, the five N-terminal (0 to 4) and the six C-terminal residues (220 to 225) are less well defined. The chain conformations at the N termini of complexes no. 1 and no. 2 are at variance, which is presumably caused by contacts to neighboring molecules. Residues 220 to 225 could only be positioned for complex no. 1 (into weak density); whereas no appropriate density was found in the case of complex no. 2. The final model agrees well with the standard peptide geometry with r.m.s. deviations from ideality of 0.016 A in bond lengths and 3,2" in bond angles. As shown in Figure 3, the main-chain dihedral angles fall mostly within the energetically favored regions (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968). Exceptions from this rule are found for three no. 1: Ser2 at residues of complex (4, $1 = (-58", -79"), Gln219 at (46", 26") and Pa1223 at (170", 95"), all of which are in regions of low density. In complex no. 2, Ser2 and Gln2 19 adopt conformations in allowed regions and Va1223 is not included in the model. A general comparison of the (4, $) angles of complexes no. 1 and no. 2 shows that for

the structurally related residues 6 through 217 the r.m.s. deviation is 6" in 4 as well as in $. This demonstrates the accuracy of these angles. The geometry of the side-chains is given in Table 2. The expected trimodal distribution of the first side-chain dihedral angle x1 with a strong preference for staggered conformations g-, t and g+ is observed. There is almost no eclipsed conformation e. In a general way, the distribution agrees with those of other proteins as for example reported by Karplus & Schulz (1987) and McGregor et al. (1987). The statistics for complex no. 2 are similar. The r.m.s. x1 difference between the two complexes is 20". This is three times higher than the r.m.s. difference of the main-chain angles and emphasizes the fact that the main-chain is better defined than the side-chains. For instance, the main-chain is less affected by crystal packing contacts.

Since the model is well refined, we used the rather restrictive cut-off criterion (distance between H and acceptor atom smaller than 2.5 a) and followed Karplus & Schulz (1987).

peptides. The basic structural motif of all adenylate kinases consists of a five-stranded, parallel p-sheet (Fig. 5) surrounded by nine a-helices, where helices 7 and 8 are separated by a proline, here Prol80. This proline is conserved in all adenylate kinases. It disturbs the hydrogen bonding pattern so that helix 7 changes its direction by about 30" before continuing as helix 8. While this part of the structure resembles the chain fold of the small variants of adenylate kinases (Schulz et aE., 1986): a stretch of 39 residues forms the separa.te domain INSERT consisting of two B-meanders. These P-meanders are loosely connected to form a six-stranded curved antiparallel p-pleated sheet specified in Figure 5 and illustrated in Figure 6. This domain is further stabilized by side-chain hydrogen bond interactions as listed in Table 3. The statistics of main-chain dihedral angles and hydrogen bond parameters in a-helices and P-sheets are given in Table 4. They are in general agreement with those of other proteins (Karplus & Schulz, 1987). (c) Non-crystallographic

elucidation. Soon after beginning the refinement, significant deviations from an overall NCS relation were recognized (Diederichs & Schulz, 1990). They amounted to up to 3 A for backbone atoms and gave rise to an r.m.s. deviation of 1.1 A (all atoms) between the two complexes. This number drops appreciably if the domains MAIN, INSERT and AMPbd are separately overlaid. In this case, the allatom r.m.s. deviation is @4 8. If subdivided into main- and side- (given in parentheses) chain atoms

the r.m.s. deviations are: 0.32 .& (052 8) for MAIN (residues 5 to 32, 59 to 123, 163 to 215), 038 a (0.52 8) for AMPbd (residues 33 to 68) and 0.27 a (0.50 a) for INSERT (residues 124 to 162). The deviations are best characterized by superimposing domain MAIN of complex no. 1 on its counterpart in complex no. 2 and comparing the resulting positions of the other domains. This superposition shows that in complex no. 1 domain INSERT is rotated by 9" toward domain AMPbd and that domain AMPbd is rotated by 7" toward Both rotations close the large substrate INSERT. binding cleft (Diederichs & Schulz, 1990) to some extent, rendering complex no. 1 more "closed" than no. 2.

factors

The mean temperature factor for all atoms of the refined model is 33.0 8'. Subset averages are: 26.5 A2 for the main-chain atoms, 38.3 A2 for sidechain atoms and 49-2 A2 for solvent atoms. The variation of the bemperature factors along the mainchain is plotted in Figure `7. A striking feature in this Figure is the high temperature factor of domain AMPbd of complex no. 1 in comparison to complex no. 2. This difference can be explained by the crystal lattice contacts (see below). Towards the N and C termini, the temperature factor rises sharply in both complexes. It seems therefore likely that neither N nor C termini have defined structures in solution. The occupancies of all solvent molecules have been fixed at lOOoh. The mean temperature factor of the NCS-related solvent molecules modeled as water is merely 40.0 A2 while that of the other water molecules is 55.0 A2, which indicates a tighter a0

These sulfates occupy the "giant anion hole" formed by the glycine-rich loop as observed in AK1 (Dreusicke & Schulz, 1986), but they are much less rigorously bound than in AKl.

(e) Crystal packing
As demonstrated in Table 5, the strongest packing interactions in the crystal occur between the NCS-related complexes. The contacts between complexes related by crystallographic symmetry are much weaker. Ala103-Gln105 and Vall3542ly113 form a small distorted intermolecular antiparallel

p-sheet. This contact occurs twice (packing interactions IV and V of Table 5) such that it does not give rise to dimers, but connects subsequent molecules forming a linear string along the b axis of the crystal. These favorable contacts along the b axis are likely to enhance crystal growth along this very direction. This corresponds to the observation that crystals are usually about ten times larger along the b axis than along the a and c axes. The lattice contacts of domain AMPbd differ appreciably in the two complexes. In complex no. 1, AMPbd contacts only a few residues of an NC&related molecule, wherea.s AMPbd of complex no. 2 is stabilized by a contact with the C-terminal helix of complex no. 1. As a consequence, the factor for AMPbd is lower in average temperature complex no. 2 (28 A2) than in complex no. 1 (40 A'). The same applies for the mean temperature factor of the bound AMP (29 A2 in complex no. 1, 40 A2 in complex no. 2). (f) The AMP binding site

The AMP binding site is located in the pocket between the helices 2, 3 and 4. The contacts of AMP are given in Table 6. The binding geometry is illus-

trated in Figure 8. In crystals of AKyst:Ap,A and AKeco:Ap,A, one of the adenines binds at the equivalent location. The known high specificity of the adenylat)e kinases towards AMP, which contrasts their lower specificity for ATP, together with the highly conserved sequence in this region allowed Egner et al. (1987) to assign this site as the AMP site. This hypothesis is confirmed by the crystal structure presented here. Hydrogen bond interactions between enzyme and substrate AMP involve mostly the nucleotide base of AMP; all nitrogen atoms take part. Adenine is hydrogen-bonded to the side-chains of Ser36 and Gln96 as well as to the amide of Tie64 and the carbonyl of Gly89. Gly89 is located in a loop which interacts with the Gly-rich loop via salt bridge Asp888QD2:Lysl8-NZ. The loop conformation is stabilized by cis-Pro91, which is conserved in all known adenylate kinases. While Gln96 is also a conserved residue, Ser36 is exchanged for Thr in some species (Schulz et al., 1986). But Thr has a hydroxyl in the y-position like Ser, so that this exchange has probably only minor effects. One may therefore assume that these four residues warrant the high specificity of the adenylate kinases for the base adenine.

The ribose and the phosphate of AMP are much less rigidly bound than the base. The average temperature factors for (adenine, ribose, phosphate) are (25 A2, 45 A2, 63 A2) in complex no. 1 and (17 82, 31 A2, 48 82) in complex no. 2. Only the 2'.hydroxyl of the ribose forms a strong hydrogen bond directly to the polypeptide; all other ribose atoms are either hydrogen-bonded to water molecules or they contact non-polar atoms (Table 6). The phosphate contacts water as well as the guanidinium groups of Arg41 and Arg92. Taken together, the base adenine seems to .sit snugly at its final position for catalysis while further movements have to be expected for ribose and phosphate. As shown in Figure 8(b), the sulfate loop is rather far away bound in the glycine-rich from the phosphate of AMP. Since this sulfate corresponds to the j-phosphate of ATP as derived from ApsA bound to the adenylate kinases AKyst as well as AKeco (U. Abele & C. W. Miiller, personal communications), it is clear that some movement of AMP relative to ATP has to occur to allow transfer of the y-phosphoryl group of ATP. Such a movement has been derived from a comparison between several different adenylate kinase structures (Schulz et al., 1990). We thank Dr A Tomasselli, Dr L. H. Noda and S. Burger for providing us with the enzyme and the crystals for this study. References Baker, E. N. & Hubbard, R. E. (1984). Hydrogen Bonding in Globular Proteins. Progr. Biophys. -fi4oZ.
