ABSTRACT We have employed a structure-based three-dimensional quantitative structure­activity relationship (3D-QSAR) approach to predict the biochemical activity for inhibitors of T. cruzi dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS). Crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme with eight different inhibitors of the DHFR activity together with the structure in the substrate-free state (DHFR domain) were used to validate and refine docking poses of ligands that constitute likely active conformations. Structural information from these complexes formed the basis for the structure-based alignment used as input for the QSAR study. Contrary to indirect ligand-based approaches the strategy described here employs a direct receptor-based approach. The goal is to generate a library of selective lead inhibitors for further development as antiparasitic agents. 3D-QSAR models were obtained for T. cruzi DHFR-TS (30 inhibitors in learning set) and human DHFR (36 inhibitors in learning set) that show a very good agreement between experimental and predicted enzyme inhibition data. For crossvalidation of the QSAR model(s), we have used the 10% leave-one-out method. The derived 3D-QSAR models were tested against a few selected compounds (a small test set of six inhibitors for each enzyme) with known activity, which were not part of the learning set, and the quality of prediction of the initial 3D-QSAR models demonstrated that such studies are feasible. Further refinement of the models through integration of additional activity data and optimization of reliable docking poses is expected to lead to an improved predictive ability.

INTRODUCTION The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent for Chagas' disease. The disease is endemic in Latin America where it kills 30,000 people each year and the total number of infected individuals is estimated to be between 18 and 26 million. There is no cure for Chagas' disease. Drugs that are currently used to treat acute symptoms produce serious side effects and are ineffective in the chronic stage. With more than 100 million people in 21 countries at risk and no hope for a vaccine in the foreseeable future, new therapeutic avenues for treatment of Chagas' disease are urgently needed.1­3 Recently, we showed that the antifolate drug trimetrexate is a potent inhibitor of the dihydrofolate reductase activity of T. cruzi and is capable of killing the parasite.4 Drugs targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) have been successfully used in the treatment of a variety of infectious diseases caused by bacteria and parasites.5,6 Structural studies revealed enough structural variability to allow the development of species-specific inhibitors.7­17 In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of a structure-based approach to develop selective DHFR inhibitors for the treatment of T. cruzi infection. The accurate prediction of binding affinities and biochemical activities of ligands (inhibitors) is one of the major challenges in computational drug design approaches.

at determining structure­activity relationships and using this knowledge to develop new compounds with greater activity and a better selectivity index for a specific target.18 Traditional quantitative structure­activity relationship (QSAR) studies are ligand-based and rely entirely on ligand structures and experimentally determined biochemical activity data. These studies often use a number of descriptors that define certain ligand properties. The necessary alignment of ligands for analysis is not trivial, especially for highly flexible molecules. Alignment can be accomplished by superimposition and alignment of substructures. In addition, it is possible to use pharmacophore points from a reliable pharmacophore model for alignment.19,20 Modern three-dimensional or 3D-QSAR methods such as comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and the hypothetical active site lattice (HASL) approach are also ligand-based and require a similar binding mode and a reliable alignment of ligands.21,22 Many successful 3D-QSAR studies have been reported, but the proper alignment and the choice of ligand conformations can be misleading if no definitive structural information is available.18,23 On the other hand, structurebased methods such as docking approaches can generate fairly accurately the position and orientation of molecules in the ligand-binding site of the receptor. However, scoring functions cannot be used to accurately evaluate free energies of binding, and thus for the ranking of inhibitors in order of binding affinities.24 Studies that demonstrate a reliable correlation of docking scores with biochemical or biological activity are rare and may require ensembles of bound ligand conformations and the incorporation of a flexible protein model.25 The combination of structurebased methods and observed binding modes of ligands derived from crystal structures together with 3D-QSAR studies promises major improvements in the prediction of binding affinities and activities of novel molecules. We have solved the structure of the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase enzyme of T. cruzi (TcDHFR-TS) and have analyzed structural information obtained from the substrate-free (in the active site of the DHFR domain) protein and from complexes with eight different DHFR inhibitors. Among these, structure of TcDHFR-TS in complex with methotrexate (MTX) was used for direct comparison with the structure of human DHFR with MTX (PDBId: 1DLS). The coordinates and structure factors for three of the TcDHFR-TS structures have been submitted to PDB (substrate-free state: 2H2Q; TMQ complex: 3CLB; MTX complex: 3CL9). These results provide the basis for the structurebased approach discussed in this paper.

assay and crystal structure analysis. The enzyme will be referred to as TcDHFR throughout this communication. All inhibitors discussed in this communication are inhibitors of DHFR function and the DHFR active site was used as the receptor for docking studies.
Enzyme inhibition assays

Purification of the T. cruzi enzyme has been reported earlier.4 Enzyme inhibition assays for TcDHFR and hDHFR were conducted in a spectrophotometer by measuring the reaction velocities in a quartz cell at several fixed concentrations of substrate dihydrofolate (DHF; 4­30 lM), a fixed concentration of NADPH (150 lM), and varying concentrations of inhibitors. The reactions were initiated by adding 1 or 3 lg of purified TcDHFR or hDHFR, respectively. The reaction velocities are determined for 1 min (absorbance reading each sec) by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to oxidation of NADPH to NADP1 and reduction of DHF to tetrahydrofolate (THF; coupled e 5 12,260 M21cm21). The activity of the T. cruzi enzyme was measured in 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and that of the human enzyme in 50 mM KH2PO4, 250 mM KCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.3. The inhibitory constants (Ki values) were determined from Lineweaver­Burk plots. The IC50 values were calculated from the dependence of initial velocities on the concentration of inhibitors using the equation: Vi/Vo 5 (1 1 Ci/IC50)21, where Vi and Vo are the initial velocities in the presence and absence of inhibitor and Ci is the concentration of the inhibitor. Activity data for TcDHFR and hDHFR generated in this study are listed in Table IA. The Ki values for MTX for both enzymes and the IC50 values of human DHFR for the last seven inhibitors were taken from the literature.8,10,16,17 The human enzyme was a gift from Southern Research Institute (Birmingham).
Ligand generation

METHODS Purified recombinant form of the bifunctional DHFRTS enzyme of T. cruzi was used for enzyme inhibition

To generate ligand structures, we used the program package MarvinBeans/JChem (ChemAxon).28 A set of plug-ins facilitates structure-based calculation of a number of properties such as log P, log D, pKa, elemental analysis, charge distribution, H-bonds, rotatable bonds, molecular surface area, and topological polar surface area.29­31 Basic pharmacophore features can be assigned to the ligands and used as a filter for database searches. Figure 1 shows the structures of the compounds used in this study. Since the flexibility of the ligand is automatically explored in the docking approach, 3D structures of only the conformer with the lowest energy were used for each inhibitor (see Docking and Visualization section).32 The underlying principles of conformer generation are similar to the widely used program Corina (Molecular Networks GmbH).33 All hydrogen atoms

interpretation of ligands using a well-defined set of chemical and geometrical rules. A pharmacophore is derived from the protein­ligand interaction pocket by identifying complementary interactions based on this set of rules.34 Figure 2 shows the identified pharmacophore features of the inhibitors derived from crystal structures of seven TcDHFR-inhibitor complexes in two dimensions [Fig. 2(A)] and for four inhibitors in three dimensions [Fig. 2(B)]. The resolution of these structures ranges between ° 2.5 and 3.5 A. Three-dimensional pharmacophores were constructed from a defined set of six types of physicochemical features (hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, charge transfer, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and volume constraints). For four of the seven inhibitors, we have listed, excluded volumes for the ligands due to steric constraints (unfavorable interactions with ``receptor'' atoms). The substructure common to all inhibitors is the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine moiety, and as a shared pharmacophore feature the two amino groups are hydrogen bond donor groups. A number of hydrophobic centers have been identified in these molecules, but they vary according to the particular scaffold. The comparison of the MTX complexes for TcDHFR and hDHFR allowed the identification of species-specific differences in active site residues (see Table IIA), while extraction of the structure-based pharmacophore features for the other seven inhibitors through identification of excluded volumes allowed detailed description of the ligand-binding pocket (see Table IIB). Figure 3 provides a comparison of the active site in the DHFR domain for MTX complexes of T. cruzi and human enzyme. Figure 4 shows the superimposition of the X-ray poses of all eight inhibitors in the crystal structures with TcDHFR.

The eHiTS (electronic High Throughput Screening) software package (SimBioSys Inc.) for docking of flexible ligands rapidly enumerates mappings of interacting atoms between receptor and ligand using an exhaustive search algorithm.26,27 The program package and its use has been described in recent publications.35,36 The software provides energy-optimized 3D coordinates of docked poses and conformations of ligand molecules in the active site of the receptor. The docking algorithm divides the ligand into rigid fragments and flexible connecting chains (``divide and conquer approach'') with rigid fragments being docked independently in the receptor site (``Rigid Dock''). A fast graph-matching algorithm finds all matching solutions to reconstruct the input ligand (``Pose Match''). The structure is then optimized within the receptor (``Local Energy Optimization'') and structures are ranked based on the scoring function (``Ranking''). The program automatically determines appropriate protonation states for every receptor­ligand

pair, and for experimental structures it takes temperature factors into account for scoring. Because each ligand structure is divided into rigid fragments and flexible connecting chains and the docking algorithm is similar to a fragment-based approach, only a conformer with reason-

able geometry is needed as input. No ensembles of ligand conformations are required and the inherent flexibility of each ligand is taken into account. Therefore, we generated and utilized only 3D coordinates of the conformer with the lowest energy.

The extensions in volume and shape introduced by the three larger inhibitors can clearly be seen. (C) The figure shows the same view of the eight inhibitors as in Figure 4(A) (same color codes) with an overlay of the truncated HASL. The colored mesh (formed from 27 sphere centers) symbolizes a truncated version of the developed HASL model and was created by trimming the 118 receptor points in the HASL model to 27 points that showed the largest contributions (DpKi values) to predicted activities of the inhibitors in the learning set. Notice that the ``side chains'' of the three larger inhibitors (5850, 7641, and BAS1) and MTX are not covered by the mesh. Filter utility

The eHiTS filter uses 23 different chemical features of ligands (e.g., hydrophobic, H-bond donor and acceptors, p electron interactions, lone pairs) used in the eHiTS docking program that describe pharmacophore-like properties. By comparison of ``actives'' (known inhibitors of the enzyme) and ``inactives'' or decoys, the filter is capable of screening out any molecules that are not likely to dock. As this feature reduces the computational time

considerably, we have used the filter utility in the screening of databases.
Training

To circumvent the problem of picking the appropriate receptor for docking of a new ligand in correct binding mode and to facilitate calculation of a reliable binding affinity, the program was trained using eight different receptors (DHFR active sites), eight inhibitors, and 20

decoys. This validation training leads to an improvement in the parameters that are used in the scoring function and as a result docked poses that are similar to poses found in the family of structures are ranked higher. Upon completion of the training optimization, a file called ``receptors.rkba'' was created that contains all optimized parameters. This parameter file was subsequently used in all further runs of eHiTS calculations for TcDHFR.
Scoring

We used the scoring function eHiTS_Score in the docking program eHiTS as a stand-alone application.26,27 The program uses statistically derived empirical scoring with many new features. In addition to a default weight set, eHiTS_Score uses automated receptor family clustering, which is used to create sets of familyspecific scoring function weights that better represent those receptors. It also takes temperature factors of crystal structures into account. The scoring is based on interaction of surface points, and the relationship between surface points does not only depend on the distance between the atoms associated with those points but also on the angle between the surface points and the line between the atoms, as well as the torsions between the surface points. The final scoring function also includes terms for the following: (a) steric clash quadratic penalty function, (b) depth value within the binding pocket, (c) receptor surface coverage (exposed/buried hydrophobic area), (d) family coverage, (e) conformational strain energy of the ligand, (f) intramolecular interactions within the ligand, (g) entropy loss due to frozen rotatable bonds. Besides using the scoring function for ranking of the docking results, we have generated binding affinities (Kd, pKd) for the eight TcDHFR inhibitors directly from the crystal structures (using eHiTS_Score in standalone mode), and have compared these with experimental activities (see Table IB).
Visualization

set of eight inhibitors from the crystal structures together with a set of ``inactives'' (decoys). This approach is similar to a pharmacophore filter, since the program determines the features in each ligand that are likely to contribute to its interaction with residues in the binding pocket. We have generated two database sets from the Zinc database (http://blaster.docking.org/zinc/) of commercially available compounds that are based on the 2,4diaminopyrimidine scaffold (2083 molecules) and the 2,4-diaminopteridine scaffold (827 molecules).37 The latter group of compounds have not been tested for enzyme inhibition. Where necessary, 2D coordinates in databases were converted to 3D coordinates in batch mode. Initial results emphasized the power of the filter utility especially in time saving, and they demonstrated an enrichment of compounds with structures similar to known DHFR inhibitors (data not shown). A number of compounds with substructures and scaffolds different from typical antifolates showed good docking scores, but their inhibitory activity has not been evaluated yet.
3D-QSAR studies

Visualization of docking results is performed with CheVi (SimBioSys). Immediate visualization of the docking results and comparison of the docked ligand poses with the X-ray poses of inhibitors provides an early evaluation of whether the docked inhibitor conformation is suitable for subsequent QSAR studies.
In silico database screening

For the docking of a database of ligands we have trained a filter to allow a fast prescreen of the database to eliminate ``inactives'' that are not likely to dock, and to continue with more accurate docking for active compounds. For use of the filter training utility, we chose the

Initially, we generated in vitro activity data for a total of 25 inhibitors of the DHFR activity in TcDHFR (see Table I). In addition, activity data for MTX and 11 other inhibitors were taken from the literature.9,17 Of these, data for 30 inhibitors were used as a learning (training) set for 3D-QSAR studies of TcDHFR for deriving a predictive model. While six of the remaining seven inhibitors were used as a test set to validate the model, one could not be used because of technical problems with docking. We focused on one of the available QSAR programs, called HASL (eduSoft, LC), for this study, which allows prediction of activity for individual new inhibitors or a test set of new inhibitors. The QSAR program HASL uses the hypothetical active site lattice (HASL) methodology to model the interactions of small molecules with proteins.21 In this ligandbased method, molecular structures are converted to regularly spaced sets of points. Therefore, the method works well especially for candidate template molecules, whose bound active site conformation is known from crystal structures and docking runs.21 This 3D-QSAR approach is particularly suitable for activity values that are linearly proportional to the free energy of binding (such as pKi expressed as 2log Ki).21,22 The molecular lattice generated by this procedure consists of points that incorporate the atom type present and a partial activity value, such that the summation of values for any set of points corresponding to a particular molecule yields the overall activity for that molecule. By trimming the 3D-QSAR model to the smallest subset of points that retains a reasonably predictive value, a pharmacophore can be generated [see Fig. 4(C)]. We have employed a receptor-based alignment of ligands to determine the quantitative structure­activity

based on the developed structure­activity relationship in the 3D-QSAR model. This approach using the HASL method has been repeated for human DHFR, since enrichment of selective inhibitors is the goal, and the computational approach therefore predicts activities for inhibitors with unknown biological activity data for either enzyme. The learning set (Table IV) for hDHFR was based on a total of 36 compounds.

relationships using this method. We have initially used a learning set made up of 30 inhibitors. The alignment consists of the X-ray poses of the eight inhibitors from the crystal structures and the best docked poses of another 22 inhibitors [Figs. 1 and 6(A); Table III]. To validate the derived QSAR model for TcDHFR, we used a test set of six inhibitors [Figs. 1 and 6(B); Table V]. The ligands were docked in the same site and in a similar pose as the members of the learning set, and the activity of these structurally aligned molecules was predicted

The superimposition of all eight inhibitors demonstrates that the ligand-binding pocket in TcDHFR shows some plasticity especially for three inhibitors (5850, 7641, and BAS1).

The two amino groups in this substructure provide the shared pharmacophore feature (hydrogen bond donor) in all compounds in this study, not just the inhibitors crystallized with TcDHFR (see Fig. 2). In addition, a number of hydrophobic centers can be located for the inhibitors in the crystal structures, but they differ depending on the nature of the aromatic ring fused to the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine moiety or the additional substituent groups. The common features of the binding pocket analyzed for seven inhibitors as observed in the crystal structures included 13 protein residues (V26, V27, A28, D48, M49, F52, T80, I84, P85, L91, I154, Y160, and T178) and the cofactor NADPH (NAP), and demonstrated that the ligand-binding pocket in TcDHFR is almost exclusively hydrophobic, a feature that differs from human DHFR.

PY878) have to move to accommodate the side chains of these three inhibitors, and a surface representation shows extended features for the ligand-binding pocket (see Fig. 4). As a result, for these three inhibitors, additional protein residues are involved in ligand-binding (Table IIB). In addition, comparison of the ligand-binding pocket in these complexes with the TcDHFR structure in the ligand-free state (NAP, but no substrate or inhibitor in DHFR domain) showed that the active site partially closes upon ligand-binding. Because of the ligand-induced fit, docking scores for certain compounds differed from each other by factors of 100­10,000, depending on the choice of receptor structure. To allow better prediction of the binding modes, and to better account for the observed receptor flexibility, validation training was performed using the observed receptor structures and the X-ray poses of the inhibitors from all eight crystal structures of the complexes together with a set of decoy or inactive ligands. Additional training involved enrichment training with the goal to tune the scoring function to better rank ``actives'' over decoys, thereby improving enrichment. This training uses a set of active ligands and a set of decoy (inactive) ligands and was used to improve the scoring function for a single receptor. The binding mode of each inhibitor in the crystal structures was used to produce a reliable estimate of the binding affinity (pKd expressed as 2log Kd) for each ligand that was compared to the experimentally determined activity (pKi expressed as 2log Ki). A comparison of these calculated binding affinities (using eHiTS_Score in standalone mode) with experimental activities is shown in Table IB. Although the agreement of these values is good, the ligand-based 3D-QSAR methods are better suited for the reliable prediction of biological activity than docking scores. Docking of the same inhibitors into the pocket using eHiTS and comparison with the crystal structures established a good match of the docked binding mode(s) to the X-ray pose of each ligand (see Fig. 5). Comparison of docking results for all eight inhibitors with the observed X-ray poses demonstrate that, although the pose with the highest score is not necessarily the one with the lowest

rmsd, there is at least one pose among the top twenty, which shows a docked conformation for the ligand that ° is close to the X-ray pose (rmsd of 1 A or lower). Together with the X-ray poses of the eight inhibitors, we generated binding modes for 22 additional inhibitors of the learning set. Finally, the bioactive conformations of the structurally aligned 30 inhibitors together with their experimental (inhibitory) activity data resulted in a 3DQSAR model for inhibition of TcDHFR (see Table III). Regression analysis demonstrated a very good agreement of predicted and experimental activities for the learning set [Table III; Fig. 6(A)]. Crossvalidation was performed using the 10% LOO (leave-one-out) method. The QSAR model allowed the prediction of inhibitory activities against TcDHFR for a small test set, and the quality of prediction of this 3D-QSAR model was validated for these six compounds [see Table V; Fig. 6(B)]. The HASL method produced a good agreement between experimental and predicted Ki and pKi values. The objective of the 3D-QSAR studies is the enrichment of a set of selective inhibitors for TcDHFR versus hDHFR through computational prediction of binding mode, binding affinity, and inhibitory activity. Several promising scaffolds (parent scaffold: 8686, PY984, PY1011, PY983, PY980, TMP, and PY1012) have been identified (based on the experimental selectivity index; see Table I). These scaffolds can form the basis for generation of focused libraries through chemical modification of substituent groups. Syntheses of the parent scaffolds have been described in the literature.7­12 To further improve the quality of prediction and the enrichment of selective inhibitors, we have also generated an initial 3D-QSAR model for human DHFR [Table IV; Fig. 7(A)]. Crossvalidation was performed as well using the 10% LOO (leave-one-out) method. The QSAR model was validated using a small test set of six inhibitors [Table VI; Fig. 7(B)]. Regression analysis for the learning set demonstrated a good agreement between predicted and experimental activities. Validation of this model was quite good. The TcDHFR enzyme is a challenging case for structure-based drug design because of the flexibility observed

in the ligand-binding site especially for some of the larger inhibitors. Further improvements of the docking program(s) in the use of solvation parameters and the inclusion of flexibility of active site protein residues should lead to an even better agreement between docking poses and experimental binding modes. As a result, the structural alignment of molecules that provide the input for QSAR programs promises to be even more reliable in the future.

The described approach combines the strength of docking methods in the generation of likely active binding modes of inhibitors and substrates and the QSAR methods that provide quantitative structure­activity relationships allowing the prediction of activities for previously untested compounds as long as their underlying structures and binding modes conform to the developed QSAR model. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

CONCLUSIONS The goal of this computational approach is the generation of a library of selective inhibitors of TcDHFR that is of reasonable size (at least 20­30 compounds) and shows increased selectivity (SI > 100). For this reason, we have generated a 3D-QSAR model for TcDHFR using a structure-based strategy and also an initial 3D-QSAR model for the human enzyme. The current test set of TcDHFR inhibitors is relatively small, and it is clear that combining experimental activity data generated in different laboratories is not an ideal approach, especially, since in hDHFR inhibition studies, often rat liver enzyme has been used. Nonetheless, our results provide the proof of concept regarding the feasibility of this approach and the potential for leading to highly predictive QSAR models. For further refinement of the QSAR model for TcDHFR, new activity data together with the structures of the corresponding inhibitors have to be integrated to create an improved model and to provide input and predicted activities for new improved inhibitors that can be part of to be generated focused compound libraries based on a few selective scaffolds (see previous paragraphs). Since we have generated QSAR models for TcDHFR and hDHFR, prediction of these activities for both enzymes also provides a (predicted) selectivity index. For this purpose, the computation of a reliable predicted selectivity index using the described approach will require the generation of biochemical activity data for TcDHFR and hDHFR in the same lab and under the same conditions. The major strength of this study is the use of extensive structural information available from several protein-inhibitor complexes. The observed experimental binding modes allowed the evaluation of the quality of the docked binding poses that were used as input to the QSAR program HASL instead of a purely ligand-based alignment. The advantage is that these binding poses are more likely to be biologically relevant conformations than binding modes generated by alignment of molecules in solely ligand-based QSAR studies. Moreover, the approach described herein is not restricted to the study of T. cruzi DHFR, but can be extended, in principle, to other DHFR enzymes, for which detailed structures of the respective protein-inhibitor complexes are already known.
