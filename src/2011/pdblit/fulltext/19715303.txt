The effects of replacing the axial methionine ligand of the type 1 copper site with leucine on the structure and function of amicyanin have been characterized. The crystal structures of the oxidized and reduced forms of the protein reveal that the copper site is now tricoordinate with no axial ligand, and that the copper coordination distances for the two ligands provided by histidines are significantly increased. Despite these structural changes, the absorption and EPR spectra of M98L amicyanin are only slightly altered and still consistent with that of a typical type 1 site. The oxidation-reduction midpoint potential (Em) value becomes 127 mV more positive as a consequence of the M98L mutation, most likely because of the increased hydrophobicity of the copper site. The most dramatic effect of the mutation was on the electron transfer (ET) reaction from reduced M98L amicyanin to cytochrome c551i within the protein ET complex. The rate decreased 435-fold, which was much more than expected from the change in Em. Examination of the temperature dependence of the ET rate (kET) revealed that the mutation caused a 13.6-fold decrease in the electronic coupling (HAB) for the reaction. A similar decrease was predicted from a comparative analysis of the crystal structures of reduced M98L and native amicyanins. The most direct route of ET for this reaction is through the Met98 ligand. Inspection of the structures suggests that the major determinant of the large decrease in the experimentally determined values of HAB and kET is the increased distance from the copper to the protein within the type 1 site of M98L amicyanin.

ABSTRACT:

Copper proteins are common in nature and involved in a variety of biological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, and redox reactions critical to metabolism (1). The copper centers are classified according to their spectroscopic properties as type 1, type 2, or type 3. Type 1 copper sites are found in a wide range of electron transfer (ET)1 proteins, including amicyanin and azurin in bacteria, plastocyanin in plants, and multicopper oxidases such as fungal laccase and human ceruloplasmin (1). The type 1 copper site of cupredoxins consists of three relatively

strong equatorial ligands, nitrogens of two histidines and a sulfur of a cysteine, forming a trigonal plane. A weaker fourth axial ligand is usually, but not always, provided by a sulfur of a methionine (2). Azurin is atypical in that additional coordination to the copper is provided by the backbone carbonyl O of a Gly, giving that copper site a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. In amicyanin from Paracoccus denitrificans, the three strong equatorial copper ligands are provided by residues His53, His95, and Cys92 and the weak axial ligand is provided by Met98 (3). Amicyanin (4) serves as a mediator of ET from methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) (5) to cytochrome c551i (6). These three proteins are isolated from P. denitrificans as individual soluble proteins, but they have to form a ternary complex to catalyze methylamine-dependent cytochrome c551i reduction (7, 8). The complex of MADH, amicyanin, and cytochrome c551i is one of the best-characterized physiological protein ET systems (9). The proteins have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography as the binary complex of MADH and amicyanin and the ternary protein complex, which includes cytochrome c551i (10). The protein complexes were shown to be catalytically active and able to perform ET in the crystalline state (11). Although it is a thermodynamically favorable reaction, MADH does not reduce cytochrome c551i in the absence of amicyanin. Furthermore, reduced amicyanin does not reduce oxidized cytochrome c551i in the absence of MADH at physiologic pH because the oxidation-reduction midpoint potential (Em) value of free amicyanin is much more positive than that of the

The redox properties of amicyanin are altered upon formation of the complex with MADH to facilitate the reaction by lowering the Em value of amicyanin in the complex under physiological conditions (12). ET reactions can be classified as true, gated, or coupled (9, 13). In a true ET reaction, the rate-limiting reaction step is the ET event. Thus, the observed rate is the same as the true rate of ET (kET). ET from Cu(I) of amicyanin to the heme of cytochrome c551i in the ternary protein complex has been studied in solution by stopped-flow spectroscopy and shown to be a true ET reaction. Analysis of the temperature and G° dependence of true ET reactions by ET theory (14) yields values for the reorganization energy () and electronic coupling (HAB) which determine the observed ET rates. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have previously altered specific amino acid residues of amicyanin that can modulate its Em value and that alter ET rates within the MADH-amicyanin-cytochrome c551i complex by altering values of G°, HAB, and . We have also generated mutations that alter the kinetic mechanisms of these ET reactions and convert true ET reactions to coupled or gated ET reactions (reviewed in ref 9). In previous studies, Met98, which provides the distal axial copper ligand, was converted to Gln and Ala (15, 16). In M98Q amicyanin, the side chain O of the Gln provided the axial copper ligand, but the site exhibited rhombic distortion which was correlated with an increase in  for the ET from MADH (16). It had been anticipated that the copper site of M98A amicyanin would lack the fourth ligand; however, it still possessed a type 1 copper site with a water molecule providing an axial ligand. This M98A amicyanin exhibited redox and ET properties similar to those of native amicyanin (15). In this study, the axial ligand of amicyanin was converted to leucine by site-directed mutagenesis. It was expected that the leucine cannot provide a ligand as its side chain does not possess a heteroatom and its side chain size would prevent water from occupying the site. This mutation is also of interest as there are naturally occurring type 1 copper sites with a leucine in the position typically occupied by methionine. These have been structurally characterized only in multicopper oxidases (17) such as laccase (18) and ceruloplasmin (19, 20), although alignment of deduced amino acid sequences indicates that this feature may also be present in certain plantacyanins (21). This study describes the effects of an M98L mutation on amicyanin's structure, visible and EPR spectra, Em value, and kET, , and HAB associated with its ET reaction to cytochrome c551i. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Isolation. MADH (22), amicyanin (4), and cytochrome c551i (6) were purified from P. denitrificans as previously described, and protein concentrations were calculated using known extinction coefficients for oxidized amicyanin (595 = 4610 cm-1 M-1), MADH (440 = 26200 cm-1 M-1), and cytochrome c551i (409 = 102000 cm-1 M-1). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create M98L amicyanins on double-stranded pMEG (23), which contains mauC that encodes amicyanin, using forward and reverse mutagenic primers with the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene). The oligonucleotide sequences used to construct the site-directed mutant were 50 -GACTATCACTGTACCCCGCATCCCTTCCTTCGCGGCAAGGTCG-30 and its complementary strand of DNA. The underlined bases are those that

are changed to create the desired mutation. The entire 555-base mauC-containing fragment was sequenced to ensure that no second site mutations were present, and none were found. M98L amicyanin was expressed in BL21 (Escherichia coli) cells and isolated from the periplasmic fraction as described for other recombinant amicyanin mutants (23). Protein Reconstitution. It was previously observed that the as-isolated M98Q and M98A amicyanins did not have full occupancy of copper in the type 1 site. This was in part due to the presence of zinc (24). An additional procedure (25) was required to unfold the protein, remove any metal ions, and incorporate Cu2þ into the refolded protein. M98L amicyanin was incubated in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 6 M guandinine-HCl, 50 mM EDTA, and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The unfolded apoprotein was diluted 50-fold into 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM DTT. The protein was then dialyzed against 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.0) at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by dialysis against 250 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.0) overnight. The dialyzed protein solution was then brought to room temperature and titrated against copper sulfate. Copper incorporation was monitored by the increase in visible absorbance, and excess copper sulfate was removed by buffer exchange and ultrafiltration. The extinction coefficient of the reconstituted M98L amicyanin was determined by anaerobic reductive titration of the fully oxidized protein with a solution of sodium dithionite which was standardized by titration with native amicyanin. Determination of Em Values. The Em values of M98L amicyanin free and in complex with MADH in solution were determined by spectrochemical titration as described previously with the native protein (12). The ambient potential was measured directly with a redox electrode which was calibrated using quinhydrone (a 1:1 mixture of hydroquinone and benzoquinone) as a standard with an Em value of 286 mV at pH 7.0. The reaction mixture contained 130 M amicyanin in 50 mM BisTris propane buffer at the indicated pH, at 25 °C. The mixture was titrated by addition of incremental amounts of a reductant, ascorbate, or an oxidant, ferricyanide. The absorption spectrum of M98L amicyanin was recorded at different potentials, and the concentrations of oxidized and reduced M98L amicyanin were determined by comparison with the spectra of the completely oxidized and reduced forms. The data were analyzed according to eq 1 to determine Em values. E ¼ Em þ ð2:3RT=nFÞ log½amicyaninoxidized =½amicyaninreduced ð1Þ For determination of the Em value of M98L amicyanin in complex with MADH, the reaction mixture contained 20 M M98L amicyanin and 60 M MADH in 50 mM BisTris propane buffer (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. Potassium ferricyaninde (400 M), quinhydrone (200 M), and phenanine ethosulfate (20 M) were present as mediators. The absorption spectrum of the complex was recorded at different potentials, and the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced forms were determined by comparison with the spectra of the completely oxidized complex and a mixture of oxidized MADH with fully reduced amicyanin. Data were then analyzed according to eq 1. Kinetic Studies of Electron Transfer Reactions. The rates of ET reactions from reduced amicyanin to oxidized cytochrome c551i in the ternary protein complex were determined using an Online Instruments (OLIS, Bogard, GA) RSM stopped-flow

Choi et al. amicyanin was subjected to the identical reconstitution procedure (discussed above) that was applied to M98L amicyanin. These EPR spectra were obtained with a microwave power of 0.2 mW and a modulation amplitude of 3 G. Structure Determinations by X-ray Crystallography. Prior to crystallization trials, the protein was dialyzed against 5 mM sodium monobasic/potassium dibasic phosphate buffer (pH 6.6). Attempts to crystallize M98L amicyanin by following the previously used protocols for native and several other mutant amicyanins (3, 15) failed to yield crystals. Therefore, M98L amicyanin was screened for a wide range of conditions using various Hamption screens (Hampton Research, Aliso Vieja, CA). Finally, the crystals of M98L amicyanin were grown by the sitting drop method using 2 L of protein (11 mg/mL) with 2 L of 3.2 M ammonium sulfate in 90 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mM NaCl. The crystals were grown in 1-2 weeks. The size of the crystals was 50 m Â 25 m Â 30 m. Attempts to grow larger crystals using macroseeding did not succeed, but these  ° small crystals yielded data to 2.1 A resolution when tested in the 24ID beamline equipped with Microdiffractometer-MD2 at the NE-CAT, Advance Photon Source using an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector. The data for oxidized M98L amicyanin were collected near the absorption edge of the copper. The M98L amicyanin crystallized in a new hexagonal space group (P6322), compared to that of native and several other mutant amicyanins determined earlier. The data were integrated, scaled, and merged using HKL2000 (27). The reduced M98L amicyanin was prepared by transferring an oxidized crystal to the mother liquor containing an additional component of 8 mM sodium ascorbate and soaking for 12 min. Reduced M98L amicyanin diffracted ° to 2.2 A resolution. Oxidized and reduced crystals were flashfrozen in the liquid nitrogen using frombin as a cryoprotectant. No bleaching of color of the oxidized crystal from the blue Cu(II) to the colorless Cu(I) was observed during data collection, indicating that reduction did not occur in the X-ray beam. This is consistent with structures of native amicyanin and other mutants of amicyanin determined previously using data collected with synchrotron radiation which did not show any X-ray-induced radiation damage. The structure of oxidized M98L amicyanin was determined by molecular replacement using PHASER (28) of PHENIX (29). A ° 1.3 A resolution crystal structure of the native amicyanin (PDB entry 1AAC) was used as an initial model, with residue Met98 trimmed at the C atom. A difference Fourier map (Fo - Fc) was then computed using coordinates of the refined native amicyanin model which resulted in clear electron density for leucine at residue 98, and subsequently, it was changed to Leu98. For reduced M98L amicyanin, the completely refined oxidized M98L amicyanin was directly submitted to rigid body and positional refinement procedures using PHENIX. For cross validation, 10% of all reflections were set aside from refinement for calculation of Rfree (30) for the oxidized state (1198 reflections) and reduced state (1068 reflections). No restraints were applied to the copper, ligand distances, or bond angles. The models were subjected to positional and B-factor refinement alternatively which reduced R and Rfree to the mid-twenties. Subsequently, water molecules were added to the models using PHENIX. The models were checked and built using COOT (31). A simulated annealing omit map around the copper region was calculated for both the oxidized and reduced structures to remove the model bias. A total of 82 and 72 water molecules were added to oxidized and reduced structures, respectively. There was significant

rapid scanning spectrophotometer as described previously (8). Experiments were performed in 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). Before the samples had been mixed, one stopped-flow syringe contained oxidized cytochrome c551i while the other contained reduced MADH and reduced amicyanin, to ensure that MADH and amicyanin are in complex before the reaction with cytochrome c551i (8). The concentration of the MADHamicyanin complex is varied and in excess of a fixed concentration of cytochrome c551i to maintain pseudo-first-order conditions. As ET from reduced amicyanin to cytochrome c551i will occur only when the amicyanin is in complex with MADH (7), the concentration of amicyanin in complex ([A]bound) is calculated according to eq 2 ½Abound ¼ ð2½Mtotal þ Kd -½4½Mtotal Kd þ Kd 2 Þ0:5 =2 ð2Þ

where [M]total is the total concentration of MADH or amicyanin, which are present in equal concentrations. Absorbance changes were monitored between 530 and 570 nm to determine the rate of reduction of cytochrome c551i. The data were fit to the simple kinetic model in eq 3 using eq 4. s MADHred - Ared þ c551iox Fs MADHred - Ared - c551iox R s Fs MADHred - Aox - c551ired R

Each reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mM methylamine. Activity was monitored by the change in absorbance due to the reduction of cytochrome c551i.

negative density at the Cu(II) position of the oxidized structure, and subsequently, a copper occupancy of 0.66 was estimated by alternative cycles of B-factor and occupancy refinement (32). No such negative density was observed in the reduced structure, even though it was generated by reduction of the oxidized crystal. The final R and Rfree values were 18.5 and 21.4 for oxidized M98L amicyanin and 18.4 and 20.0 for reduced M98L amicyanin, respectively. The final models of the oxidized and reduced M98L mutant contain phosphate, chloride, zinc, and acetate molecules in addition to copper. The average isotropic temperature factor for the oxidized state ° ° is 36.0 A2 for all protein atoms and 44.0 A2 for water ° molecules, while those values are 34.0 and 40.4 A2, respectively, for the reduced state. The data collection, refinement, and model statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Spectroscopic Properties. Native amicyanin exhibits a major absorbance maximum centered at 595 nm (4). The ratio of absorbance at 280 nm to that at 595 nm (280/595) is approximately 3.5 for pure native amicyanin. For oxidized M98L amicyanin, the absorption maximum is shifted to 601 nm. A280/A601 for the as-isolated M98L amicyanin is 5, despite appearing pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Addition of Cu(II) caused no increase in A601, suggesting that low absorbance was not due to a subpopulation of apoamicyanin, which would be expected to readily incorporate copper. An abnormally low A280/A595 was previously observed for the asisolated M98Q and M98A amicyanin mutant proteins (24). This was due to partial occupancy of the metal site by zinc rather than copper. As such, the as-isolated M98L amicyanin was subjected to a procedure originally developed by Diederix et al. (25) to remove any metal atoms and then fully reconstitute the metalbinding site with Cu(II). After this procedure was applied to M98L amicyanin, it exhibited an absorption spectrum very similar to that of native amicyanin, except for the shift in the absorption maximum (Figure 1 and Table 2). The extinction coefficient of the reconstituted M98L amicyanin at 601 nm was

Choi et al. The significance and source of the zinc in the M98L amicyanin structure are unclear. It is possible that the source of zinc could be from impurities of the chemicals used during the crystallization trials. A chloride ion stabilizes the molecule by forming strong hydrogen bonds to Lys68 NZ and Arg99 NH1. A phosphate group is located on the crystallographic 2-fold axis and interacts with residue Lys2 NZ. The rms deviation between native (PDB entry 2OV0) and ° M98L amicyanin is 0.68 A with 103 matched CR atoms based on the secondary structure matching (39) calculated with CCP4MG (34) (Figure 3). It was previously observed that N-terminal residues 1-21 comprise a very flexible loop segment and adopt variable conformations (40). When this segment is omitted, the rms deviation between M98L and native amicyanins ° is 0.4 A. By comparing the native and M98L amicyanins, we note that residues 28-31, 49, 50, 59-65, 94-97, 99, and 105 deviate ° by g0.5 A. Glu31 which is predicted to be the point of interprotein transfer from amicyanin to cytochrome c551i deviates by ° 0.6 A, and the region of residues 28-31 of M98L amicyanin ° deviates by 0.5-0.7 A with respect to native amicyanin. The side chain atoms CG, CD, OE1, and OE2 of Glu31 did not have electron density in the oxidized state, and the temperature factor ° for the individual atoms of this residue varies from 44 to 58 A2. In the case of the reduced form, the side chain of Glu31 has density for all the atoms at the 0.8 level and the temperature factor for ° the individual atoms of the residues varies from 46 to 69 A2. The hydrophobic residues of amicyanin (94-97) which interact with ° MADH deviate by 0.6-0.7 A with respect to those of native amicyanin. The analysis of residues 26-28, 48-52, 73, and 74, which are within or close to the MADH-amicyanin interface (41), indicates that only Met28, Glu49, and Ala50 show ° deviations of >0.5 A. The copper coordination distances in the oxidized and reduced states of M98L and native amicyanins are listed in Table 3. The superposition of the copper binding region of M98L amicyanin with native amicyanin is shown in Figure 3. There is significant negative density at the copper position of the oxidized M98L amicyanin structure, and a subsequent occupancy refinement of the copper revealed an occupancy of 66% with a B-factor of ° 40 A2. There is no such negative density for copper in the reduced M98L amicyanin structure, which was generated by reduction of ° the oxidized crystal even though the B-factor is 47 A2. Furthermore, the copper site appears to be fully occupied in the solution state (discussed earlier). It is unlikely that the lower occupancy calculated for the Cu(II) in the oxidized structure is due to multiple orientations for the copper site since the three ligands have very clear density and B-factors comparable to those of the other protein atoms. The lower calculated occupancy most likely reflects greater thermal motion of Cu(II) in the oxidized structure relative to Cu(I) in the reduced structure. The rms deviations between CR atoms calculated after omission of residues 1-21 of oxidized and reduced M98L, oxidized M98A (PDB entry 2IDQ), and oxidized M98Q (PDB entry ° 2IDT) amicyanins are 0.08, 0.36, and 0.42 A, respectively. The superposition of copper sites in M98L, M98A, and M98Q amicyanins is shown in Figure 4. Comparison of the Type 1 Copper Sites of M98L Amicyanin with Those of Laccase and Ceruloplasmin. The multicopper oxidases laccase and ceruloplasmin each possess a type 1 copper site with leucine in the position normally occupied by the axial ligand (19, 42). The superposition of copper sites of M98L amicyanin, laccase, and ceruloplasmin is shown in Figure 5.

Spectra of the reconstituted native (A) and M98L (B) amicyanins were recorded in 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 5% glycerol.

determined by reductive titration of the fully oxidized protein with a standard solution of sodium dithionite and was very similar to that for native amicyanin at 595 nm (Table 2). The EPR spectrum of M98L amicyanin exhibits similarities and differences with respect to that of native amicyanin (Figure 2). The EPR spectrum of M98L amicyanin shows a very small hyperfine splitting that is typical of a type I copper center. The g values for native and M98L amicyanin are 2.24 and 2.29, respectively, indicating a slightly increased g anisotropy in the mutant protein. The corresponding A values were 53 and 39 G, respectively. As a control, native amicyanin was also subjected to the protocol to remove and then reconstitute the protein with Cu(II). The absorption and EPR spectra of the reconstituted native amicyanin were essentially unchanged from that of the as-isolated native amicyanin (not shown), confirming that the spectral differences observed with M98L amicyanin were not an artifact of the reconstitution procedure used to fully load the M98L amicyanin site with copper. There is a minor signal in the reconstituted native amicyanin that is likely from adventitious Cu(II) acquired during the reconstitution process. Crystal Structures of M98L Amicyanin. The oxidized and reduced states of M98L amicyanin were determined at 2.1 and ° 2.2 A resolution, respectively. This amicyanin mutant was crystallized in hexagonal space group P6322, which is different from that of native and several mutants of amicyanin determined previously (3, 15). There is a zinc ion present at the surface in both ° oxidized and reduced structures of M98L amicyanin 2.9 A from ° the NE1 atom of His95 and 3.6 A from SD atom of Met51. The zinc was identified on the basis of the anomalous difference Fourier map, and subsequent refinement confirmed its presence. The zinc is located on a crystallographic 3-fold axis and is coordinated by three copies of His95 NE1 and three copies of Met51 SD. M98L amicyanin was purified initially with some zinc bound instead of copper, and subsequently, it was unfolded and reconstituted with CuSO4 to generate the functional protein (discussed in Experimental Procedures). The same was true for M98A and M98Q amicyanins (24), but zinc was not present in the crystal structures of those copper-reconstituted proteins (15).

Cu(II) is shown as a red sphere. In the bottom panel, the type 1 copper sites are superimposed with M98L amicyanin colored red and native amicyanin colored blue. The Cu(II) in each structure is shown as a sphere in its respective color.

The copper coordination distances for each type 1 copper site are listed in Table 3. ° The laccase structure which was determined at 1.3 A resolution contains one type 1 copper, one type 2 copper, and two type 3 copper sites (42). The amicyanin superimposes with the type 1 ° copper site of laccase with a rms deviation of 2.20 A with 80 matched CR atoms based on the secondary structure matching (39) calculated with CCP4MG (34), while the level of sequence identity between them is 16.3% (31). When the copper with its four ligands of M98L amicyanin is superimposed with the ° similar region of laccase, the rms deviation of CR is 0.60 A (Figure 5). The difference in the position of the copper between ° M98L amicyanin and laccase is 0.9 A, and the rms deviation between the ligands of copper of M98L amicyanin and laccase ° varies by 0.4-0.8 A. ° The ceruloplasmin structure was determined at 3.8 A resolution (19). It contains six domains. There are three mononuclear sites and one trinuclear site in this structure. The type 1 copper sites are present in the even-numbered ° domains (2, 4, 6). The copper site in domain 6 is situated 13 A from the trinuclear site, while the sites in domains 2 and 4 are ° each at a distance of 18 A. The type 1 copper site similar to that of M98L amicyanin is located in domain 2 of ceruloplasmin. The superposition of M98L amicyanin with domain 2 of ° ceruloplasmin (148 residues) shows a rms deviation of 2.6 A

with 75 matched CR atoms based on the secondary structure matching (39) calculated with CCP4MG (34), despite a level of sequence identity of only 9.3% between them (31). The superposition of the copper sites yields a rms deviation of ° 0.70 A, and the rms deviation between ligands of copper varies ° by 0.5-0.9 A. Redox Properties. The Em values of M98L amicyanin, both free and in complex with MADH in solution, were determined by spectrochemical titration (Table 2). The Em value of native amicyanin is pH-dependent with a pKa value of 7.7 (12). The pKa describes the phenomenon in which reduced amicyanin exhibits a pH-dependent conformational change in which the His95 copper ligand rotates out of the coordination sphere of the copper when protonated (12). When amicyanin is in complex with MADH, the redox- and pH-dependent conformational change of His95 is restricted. Therefore, the Em value of amicyanin in complex with MADH at physiological pH is similar to that of free amicyanin in the pH-independent region (i.e., pH 9.0). Thus, formation of a complex with MADH effectively shifts the pKa value for amicyanin to a much lower pH. This is critical for physiologic function, since at physiological pH the Em value of cytochrome c551i is much less positive than that of free amicyanin (43). Formation of a complex with MADH lowers the Em value of the bound amicyanin, facilitating ET to the cytochrome.

Choi et al. The Em value of M98L amicyanin at pH 7.0 is 127 mV more positive than the Em value of native amicyanin (Table 2). Unfortunately, a pH profile for the Em value of M98L amicyanin could not be obtained because of the instability of M98L amicyanin during the redox titrations at higher pH, so it was not possible to determine the pKa value for this mutant. The Em value of M98L amicyanin in complex with MADH was determined at pH 7.5 (experimental conditions for study of the ET reactions) to be 91 mV more positive than that of native amicyanin in complex with MADH (Table 2). The Em value in the complex was used to determine the G° value for the ET reactions described later. The similar increases in Em for M98L amicyanin in the free state and in complex with MADH, with respect to that of native amicyanin, suggest that this effect of the mutation is primarily due to a true electronic effect on the intrinsic Em value of the copper rather than simply a change in the pKa of the Em value. ET from Reduced Amicyanin within the Ternary Protein Complex to Oxidized Cytochrome c551i. The dependence on the complex-bound amicyanin concentration of the observed rate of ET from reduced amicyanins to oxidized cytochrome c551i was determined (Figure 6A and Table 4). From these data, the values of Kd and k3 (see eq 3) were obtained. The results indicate that the M98L mutation does not have any significant effect on the Kd value for formation of the ternary protein complex. However, the observed rate of ET from M98L amicyanin is approximately 435fold slower than that of native amicyanin. The rate at 30 °C of 0.2 s-1 is also much slower than the previously reported steadystate kcat of 18 s-1 for methylamine-dependent reduction of cytochrome c551i by the complex (26). As such, this steady-state assay was performed with M98L amicyanin. The kcat for this reaction was similarly decreased to 0.4 s-1 (data not shown). This indicates that the M98L mutation causes the ET reaction from amicyanin to cytochrome c551i to become so slow that it is now the rate-limiting step in the overall catalytic and ET reactions catalyzed by the ternary protein complex. The ET reaction from M98L amicyanin is thermodynamically less favorable than the reaction from native amicyanin, and as such, kET is expected to be lower. The reaction was studied at different temperatures (Figure 6B). At each temperature, the observed decrease in rate for M98L amicyanin is much greater than predicted solely on the basis of the change in Em (i.e., G°). This means that some parameter other than G° has been altered as a consequence of the mutation. The results of the analysis of these data by eq 5 are listed in Table 5. For the ET reaction from copper to cytochrome c551i in M98L amicyanin, the value of  is unaffected by the mutation but the value of HAB is decreased 14-fold as a consequence of the mutation. This is what accounts for the larger than expected decrease in kET. To illustrate the effect of this change in HAB on rate, a simulation of what the rate would be over this temperature range if the only parameter to change was G° is shown and compared to the actual rates determined with native and M98L amicyanin (Figure 6C). DISCUSSION The crystal structure of M98L amicyanin confirms the loss of the axial fourth ligand for copper in the type 1 site. The copper ion is in a trigonal configuration. The Cu-Cys92 coordination distance is slightly increased, while the other coordination distances are much larger than in native and other Met98 mutant amicyanins (Table 3). The Cu-Leu98 distance is much greater than the axial ligand coordination distance in other amicyanins

but similar to the corresponding distances in the laccase and ceruloplasmin sites. The truly unique feature of M98L amicyanin is the increased coordination distances for both His ligands. For the sake of comparison, the coordination distances of the analogous M148L rusticyanin mutant protein are included in Table 3. It is interesting to note that, in contrast to M98L amicyanin, the M148L rusticyanin mutation causes no increase in coordination distances for the His ligands with respect to native rusticyanin (44). The absorption and EPR spectra of amicyanin are only slightly perturbed by the M98L mutation, suggesting that the Cu(II)-Cys interaction, which is least affected by the mutation, has the strongest influence over these features. It is noteworthy that while azurin exhibits a max at 626 nm, compared to 595 nm for amicyanin, the M121L azurin mutation resulted in a red shift of 5 nm (45), similar to what was observed with M98L amicyanin (Figure 1). The small hyperfine splitting in the g region of the EPR spectrum is the characteristic signature for a type I copper center and reflects the high covalency of the thiolate-Cu(II) bond in this redox center. In general, the copper hyperfine structure in the g region is the sum of the Fermi-contact, spin-dipolar, and spin-orbit contributions (46). X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-alpha scattered wave density function studies at the copper K-edge have shown that the Cu 4px and py orbitals mix into the dx2-y2 ground state of the blue copper site (47, 48). While the crystal structure of M98L amicyanin reveals loss of the axial ligation and lengthening of the two Cu(II)-His coordination distances, the Cu(II)-Cys interaction is relatively unchanged by the mutation (Table 3). The observation of a small hyperfine splitting in the parallel region of the EPR spectrum of M98L
) )

amicyanin is consistent with the idea that the Cu(II)-Cys interaction is the major determinant of this spectroscopic feature. Thus, while the axial ligand and distorted tetrahedral geometry do not contribute to the small hyperfine splitting, it does influence the exact positioning of the copper within the site. The consequences of this contribution of the axial ligand in amicyanin are discussed later. The Em value of M98L amicyanin of 421 mV is still much lower than that of the type 1 copper sites with naturally occurring leucine in the position of the axial ligand of laccase and ceruloplasmin which have Em values of 550-800 mV (20, 49). While the axial ligand is important in fine-tuning the Em value of type 1 copper proteins, several other factors may potentially influence Em, including desolvation or hydrophobic effects, the hydrogen bonding pattern around the copper site, protein constraint, and intraprotein electrostatic interactions (50). Typical Em values of type 1 copper proteins with methionine as an axial ligand are around 300 mV, except for rusticyanin which exhibits a significantly more positive Em value (2). Computational studies have attributed the influence of protein permanent dipoles to the atypical high potential of rusticyanin (51). Type 1 copper proteins possessing axial ligands other than methionine exhibit variable Em values. Stellacyanin, which has glutamine as an axial ligand (52), exhibits a less positive Em value of 184 mV. Site-directed mutagenesis of the axial methionine ligand to glutamine in other type 1 copper proteins, including amicyanin, causes a decrease in the Em value (16, 53, 54). Substitution of leucine for Met98 caused the Em value of amicyanin to become 127 mV more positive (Table 2). Replacement of the methionine axial ligand with leucine in other type 1 copper proteins has

caused an increase in the Em value similar to what was observed in amicyanin (45, 53, 55, 56). In rusticyanin, the Em value increased from 667 to 798 mV (53), and in azurin, the Em value increased from 315 to 450 mV (45). When comparing the Em values of type 1 copper proteins, we must consider that amicyanins exhibit a pH-dependent conformational change in which the His95 copper ligand rotates out of the coordination sphere of the copper when protonated in the reduced state (12, 57). However, in this study, the same Em was observed for M98L amicyanin free and in complex with MADH when the conformational change of His95 is restricted (12). Furthermore, the Em caused by the M98L mutation of amicyanin is similar to the Em reported for similar mutations of azurin and rusticyanin which do not exhibit this conformational change. Leucine possesses the highest free energy of transfer of any amino acid side chain from cyclohexane to water (4.92 kcal/mol at pH 7.0), whereas those of Met and Gln are 2.35 and -5.54 kcal/mol, respectively (58). Removal of the weak axial interaction by mutation of the Met could potentially provide a geometry more favorable for Cu(I) which would increase the Em value. The increase in Em associated with the M98L mutation likely reflects the change in the dielectric constant around the mutated residue and resulting increased hydrophobicity which will preferentially stabilize the less charged Cu(I) state. This is also consistent with correlation between Em and amino acid side chain hydrophobicity that was determined from studies in which the Met ligand of azurin was replaced with unnatural amino acids (45).

Cupredoxins with a single type 1 copper site function primarily as ET mediators (1). In multicopper oxidases, the type 1 copper sites accept electrons from the substrate which is oxidized and transfer the electrons to a trinuclear copper center where dioxygen binds and is reduced to water. The role of the protein in determining the ET properties of a type 1 copper site has been extensively studied in P. denitrificans amicyanin (9). Its physiologic electron donor and acceptor proteins have been identified, and the complex of the three proteins has been characterized structurally and functionally (8-11). An important consequence of the M98L mutation is that it significantly alters the rates of ET from copper to amicyanin within the MADH-amicyanin-cytochrome c551i complex. The influence of the amino acid residue which provides the axial ligand on ET reactivity has been investigated in other blue copper proteins (e.g., refs 59 and 60). Such studies have primarily compared changes in reaction rates with changes in Em and G° and have provided some insight into the effect of these mutations on . This study describes a more detailed analysis of the effect of the axial ligand mutation on kET and includes analysis of HAB as well as . The rate of ET from Cu(I) of reduced M98L amicyanin to the cytochrome was 435-fold less than that from native amicyanin. This is in part due to the change in Em that is caused by the M98L mutation, which makes the G° for the reaction more positive. However, the magnitudes of the changes in ET rate are much greater than what can be attributed solely to the change in G° (Figure 6). The large decrease in kET from reduced amicyanin to oxidized cytochrome c551i is primarily due to a large decrease in HAB (Table 5). To determine the structural basis for the experimentally determined decrease in HAB, the structures of reduced M98L and native amicyanins were analyzed using HARLEM (36) to calculate relative HAB values for ET from Cu(I) through amicyanin. Previous analysis of the crystal structure of the MADHamicyanin-cytochrome c551i complex indicated that the likely point of interprotein ET from amicyanin to cytochrome c551i is the protein backbone at residue Glu31 (8). Since a crystal structure of M98L amicyanin in complex with the other proteins is not available, the effects of the M98L mutation on HAB within amicyanin were determined using Cu(I) as the electron donor and the CA atom of Glu31 in each amicyanin as the electron acceptor. The calculations predict that the HAB for ET through M98L amicyanin will be less than for ET through native amicyanin by a factor of 0.055 (Table 5). This corresponds well with the experimentally determined values of HAB which showed a decrease by a factor of 0.073 ( 0.041. The calculated maximum ET rates from the structures predict a decrease of >2 orders of magnitude for M98L amicyanin. This also correlates well with the experimental results. It does not correlate exactly because the

calculated results assume activation-less ET, whereas the experimental results include the contribution to kET from G°, which is also affected by the mutation. Inspection of the structures of M98L and native amicyanins indicates that the predicted change in F, and consequently HAB, does not occur because of changes in the overall structure of the protein. With this method of analysis (37), Cu-ligand bonds are given no special treatment and the program calculates the average atom packing distance between the donor and acceptor within the united van der Waals radii of intervening atoms. The most direct ET route from copper to the site of interprotein ET is through the axial ligand. The calculated change in HAB, which is a consequence of decreased F and the corresponding increase in , is primarily a consequence of the large through-space jump which is required for the electron to move from Cu(I) to the protein via Leu98 rather than via Met98 (see Table 3). We previously reported (8) that a Pathways analysis of the MADH-amicyanincytochrome c551i complex using Greenpath (38) predicted two sets of ET pathways of comparable efficiency from the type 1 copper to the heme of cytochrome c551i. In one pathway, the electron exits copper via the Cys92 copper ligand, and in the other, it exits via the Met98 copper ligand. A critical component of the predicted pathway, from which electrons exit via Cys92, is a through-space jump from that Cys to Tyr30. Site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr30 which should have disrupted ET via this pathway did not affect the rate of ET (61). The interpretation of those results was that either ET preferentially occurred via the Met98 pathway or this ET reaction obeyed a simple distance dependence, independent of a specific pathway. These results support the previous studies and indicate that for amicyanin a critical role for the axial Met98 ligand is for mediation of ET to cytochrome c551i. Summary. The structure of M98L amicyanin bears similarities and differences with respect to those of other natural and mutant type 1 copper proteins with leucine in the analogous position. Comparison of these structures with the physical properties of these proteins has allowed better definition of the role of the axial ligand of the type 1 site. The most common structural feature is the Cu-Cys coordination distance which exerts the strongest influence over the absorption and EPR spectra. The most distinct structural feature of M98L amicyanin is the significantly longer Cu-His coordination distances. This and other studies indicate that the replacement of methionine with leucine, in the absence of other changes, causes an increase of 130 mV in the Em value. This study also demonstrates that the rate of ET from the type 1 copper site may be strongly influenced by the coordination distances. For amicyanin, the axial Met ligand, when present, constrains the distorted

tetrahedral geometry, but not the spectroscopic features of the type 1 site. It plays a physiologically important role in physically positioning the copper relative to the other ligands, which for amicyanin is critical for its ET function.
