Doxorubicin is among the most widely used anthracycline in cancer chemotherapy. In an attempt to avoid the cardiotoxicity and drug resistance of doxorubicin therapy, several analogues were synthesized. The cyanomorpholinyl derivative is the most cytotoxic. They differ greatly from their parent compound in their biological and pharmacological properties, inducing cross-links in drug DNA complexes. The present study concerns N-cyanomethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-daunomycin (CMDa), a synthetic analogue of cyanomorpholino-daunomycin. Compared to doxorubicin, CMDa displays a cytotoxic activity on L1210 leukemia cells at higher concentration but is effective on doxorubicin resistant cells. The results of fluorescence quenching experiments as well as the melting temperature (DTm = 7.5 8C) studies are consistent with a drug molecule which intercalates between the DNA base pairs and stabilizes the DNA double helix. The crystal Ê structure of CMDa complexed to the hexanucleotide d(CGATCG) has been determined at 1.5 A resolution. The complex crystallizes in the space group P41212 and is similar to other anthracycline-hexanucleotide complexes. In the crystal state, the observed densities indicate the formation of N-hydroxymethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)daunomycin (HMDa) with the release of the cyano moiety without DNA alkylation. The formation of this degradation compound is discussed in relation with other drug modifications when binding to DNA. Comparison with two other drug-DNA crystal structures suggests a correlation between a slight change in DNA conformation and the nature of the amino sugar substituents at the N3 H position located in the minor groove. Keywords: X-ray structure; anthracycline; drug/DNA complex; fluorescence quenching; melting temperature.

Derivatives of anthracycline family are effective on a variety of cancers. When patients are treated with anthracyclines alone or combined with other drugs, high cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance may considerably compromise the effectiveness of the therapy. Anthracyclines consist of an aglycon chromophore bearing an amino sugar. A search for new compounds revealed a direct structure±activity relationship between the aglycon and/or the amino sugar chemical structure and biological properties [1]. Little structural modifications can lead to less cardiotoxic compounds, more efficient or displaying a different activity spectrum. For example, while daunomycin is more effective in

the treatment of leukemia [2], the closely related adriamycin is more effective in the treatment of solid tumours [3]. Anthracyclines intercalate between two successive base pairs in the DNA double helix, but two successive sites cannot be occupied. The long axis of the chromophore is oriented roughly perpendicular to those of the flanking base pairs and the amino sugar lies in the minor groove [4]. The intercalation of anthracyclines between the DNA base pairs produces the elongation and the distortion of the double helix, inducing the inhibition of topoisomerase II [5]. The occupation of the minor groove by the amino sugar and its additional substituent groups contributes to the inhibition of topoisomerase I [6]. Inactivation of both topoisomerases I and II prevents the replication and the transcription processes. Theoretical studies [7] have predicted that daunomycin preferentially binds to the (5 H -ACG)2 and (5 H -TCG)2 binding sites. Foot-printing experiments [8] confirmed these theoretical results and underlined the binding preference of daunomycin for the [5 H -(A/T)CG]2 and [5 H -(A/T)GC]2 intercalation sites. Furthermore, experiments by fluorescence quenching method point out the high daunomycin binding affinities for duplexes containing GC base pairs as part of alternating purinepyrimidine sequence motifs [9]. At present, many crystal structures of drug-DNA complexes describe the atomic interactions between anthracyclines and DNA [10±15]. The N-cyanomethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-daunomycin (here referred as CMDa, Fig. 1), a synthetic analogue of cyanomorpholino-daunomycin, was synthesized by reference to the

extremely high antitumour potency of cyanomorpholinodoxorubicin derivatives. As a matter of fact, the morpholinodoxorubicin is 1500-fold more powerful than the parent doxorubicin itself [16]. Moreover, the cyanomorpholinyl derivative has been found to induce DNA cross-links and is the most cytotoxic compound of this family. The chemical structure difference between CMDa and cyanomorpholinodaunomycin is the opening of the 3 HH -cyano-morpholino ring between C2 HH and C3 HH . The measure of the in vitro CMDa cytotoxic activity revealed a compound able to treat L1210 cells resistant to doxorubicin. The interaction of CMDa with the DNA hexamer d(CGATCG) was investigated by UV melting profile, spectrofluorimetry and X-ray diffraction techniques. The X-ray structure does not show up the cyano moiety of CMDa. It appears that CMDa is degraded into an other compound with the loss of the cyano group. We report these results and discuss them with a comparison of a cyano group release in other drug-DNA complexes. A comparison of this crystal structure with those of daunomycin [10] (NDB entry code DDF020) or cyanomorpholino-doxorubicin [13] (NDB entry code DDF078) d(CGATCG) complexes is reported. The effects of the groups attached at the N3 H position of the anthracyclines, on the DNA conformation, are detailed.

dimethylsulfoxyde (dimethylsulfoxide) were prepared for the binding assays and the complex crystallization. Cytotoxic activity The in vitro cytotoxic activity of CMDa was investigated at the Behring Institute (Marburg, Germany). IC50 values (for CMDa and doxorubicin) were measured on L1210 leukemia cells for one hour and seven days of incubation at 37 8C. In addition IC50 values (for CMDa) were measured after 14C-thymidine incorporation in normal and doxorubicin resistant L1210 leukemia cells. Binding assays Thermal denaturation profiles were recorded with a Uvikon 933 dual beam spectrophotometer at the `Institut Gustave Roussy' (Villejuif, France). The batch temperature was increased and decreased at a rate of 0.25 8C´min21 from 3 8C to 45 8C, and the optical density (D) was recorded at 260 nm. The melting temperature (Tm) determination of d(CGATCG) was performed with a solution containing 7.2 mm d(CGATCG) single strand concentration in 150 mm sodium cacodylate buffer pH 6.5. The Tm determination of the CMDa-d(CGATCG) complex was carried out with a solution containing 7.2 mm d(CGATCG) single strand concentration with 12.0 mm CMDa in the same buffer and 0.2% dimethylsulfoxide. The Tm values were estimated from derivative curves. Fluorescence studies were carried out at the `Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal' (Pessac, France) using a Spex Fluoromax spectrofluorometer equipped with an SLM800 thermal control unit. The binding assays were performed in a 2-mL temperature controlled cell at 10 8C. The excitation wavelength was set at 480 nm and the fluorescence spectra were recorded between 520 nm and 620 nm. The buffer base line fluorescence (150 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.02% dimethylsulfoxide) was subtracted from all subsequent records. A drug solution (1.5 mm in 0.02% dimethylsulfoxide and 150 mm sodium cacodylate pH 6.5) was titrated with increasing amounts of oligonucleotide in the same buffer. The solution was gently and continuously agitated. After each addition, three spectra were recorded and averaged. Crystallization The crystals were grown at 4 8C by the vapor phase diffusion method using the hanging drop technique [17]. Initial

crystallization conditions were determined following a sparse matrix screening approach [18]. The optimal crystallization conditions were achieved by mixing 2 mL of a stock solution containing 2.2 mm d(CGATCG) (single strand concentration), 3.3 mm drug, 23% dimethylsulfoxide, 33 mm sodium cacodylate buffer pH 6.5 with 2 mL of a crystallization solution (Nucleic acid mini screen purchased from Hampton Research, USA). The crystallization solution contains 40 mm LiCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm cobalt hexamine, 10% v/v 2-methyl2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and 40 mm sodium cacodylate buffer pH 5.5. The drop was equilibrated against a 500-mL reservoir containing 35% v/v MPD. Red crystals appeared within 3 weeks and grew to reach their final size (0.50 Â 0.22 Â 0.19 mm) within 5 weeks. A single crystal was mounted and sealed in a glass capillary with a droplet of mother liquor. Crystals grew under different crystallization conditions (for example: 12 mm tetrachloride spermine, 80 mm KCl, 10% MPD and 40 mm sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.0). Data collection and reduction X-ray diffraction data were collected using an X-ray source Ê (Cu Ka, l = 1.5418 A) provided by an Enraf-Nonius FR571

rotating-anode operating at 40 kV and 50 mA. Data collection was carried out on a MarResearch 300 mm imaging plate system. The crystals were exposed to a cold (4 8C) nitrogen stream (Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream, Oxford, UK). The crystal to film distance was set to 85 mm. Each 38 oscillation frame was exposed for one hour. Crystals of this drugd(CGATCG) belong to the tetragonal space group P41212 or Ê Ê P43212 with cell dimensions a = b = 28.16(4) A, c = 53.40(2) A. The crystal diffracts at high resolution, and a complete data set Ê was collected to 1.54 A resolution. Data were auto-indexed and processed using the programs ipmosflm 6.0 [20] (A. G. W. Leslie, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK) and scala [21]. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Crystals grown under different crystallization conditions diffract to similar resolution and were isomorphous. From the unit cell dimensions and space group it was expected that the complexes were isomorphous with other anthracyclines d(CGATCG) complexes. The structure isomorphism was confirmed by molecular replacement method with amore [22] leading to space group P41212. The starting model was the daunomycin-d(CGATCG) structure (here referred as the DAU-d(CGATCG)) described previously at Ê 1.5 A resolution [10]. Refinement The structure was refined with xplor 3.851 [23]. The asymmetric unit is composed of a single strand of d(CGATCG) with one drug molecule. The refinement was interspersed with examination of (2Fo±Fc) and (Fo±Fc) electron density maps displayed using turbofrodo [24]. The structure was refined Ê Ê between 12.60 A and 1.54 A resolution. Ten percent of the reflections were reserved in a test set for cross-validation of the refinement process. The methoxyethyl group was modelled in the corresponding Fourier electron density and Fourier difference maps. The refinement was completed by addition of solvent molecules to residual peaks in Fourier difference maps above 2 s. No ions could be identified unambiguously. The final refinement stage, including 25 water molecules in the asymmetric unit, converges at R = 0.23 and Rfree = 0.28 for 3220 unique reflections at Fo $ 2 s(Fo) in the resolution range Ê of 12.60±1.54 A. Refinement statistics are given in Table 2.

The rms deviations from ideality and average thermal parameters for sugars, bases, phosphates and the drug are listed in Table 2. Helical parameters The helical parameters in accordance with EMBO Workshop guidelines [27], and torsion angles were calculated with curves 5.1 [28,29] from the coordinates of double strand drugd(CGATCG) complexes.

doxorubicin resistant L1210 leukemia cells were 0.03 and 0.1 mg´mL21, respectively. Therefore, CMDa is less active on normal L1210 leukemia cells than doxorubicin though it is able to reduce doxorubicin resistant L1210 cells proliferation. Binding assays The melting temperatures measured for d(CGATCG) alone and complexed to CMDa were 23.3 8C and 30.8 8C, respectively. It is noteworthy that the Tm determination for the drug-DNA complex gave a biphasic curve (Fig. 2). Acton et al. [30] noted this curve profile when determining DTm for N±cyanomethyldaunomycin and N±cyanomethyl-doxorubicin calf thymus DNA complexes. Whereas for cyanomorpholino-doxorubicin and N±(1-cyano-2-methoxyethyl)-daunomycin DNA complexes the DTm determination did not show up this phenomenon. A possible chemical change occurring when heating the drug-DNA solution may be involved. Fluorescence spectra show a quenching for CMDa with increased DNA concentration. At the end of the experiment, the fluorescence value only represents 4% of the value obtained for the drug solution without DNA. The fluorescence quenching

indicates that CMDa intercalates in d(CGATCG) as any other anthracyclines. By this intercalation, CMDa stabilizes the d(CGATCG) duplex by a DTm positive value of 7.5 8C.

defined by analogy with morpholino-doxorubicin except for N3 H . Solvent molecules are labelled from OW8 to OW32. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Nucleic Acid Database (accession code: DD0017 or 482d). In the structure, as in all crystal structures of anthracycline hexanucleotide complexes, the chromophore is intercalated at each extremity of the duplex, in C1-G12/G2-C11 and C5-G8/ G6-C7 steps (Fig. 3). The amino sugar moiety lies in the minor groove, while the chromophore ring D protrudes in the major groove. The long axis of the chromophore is roughly perpendicular to those of the flanking base pairs. At the early stage of the refinement, the 2Fo±Fc electron density maps perfectly fit the model. The sugar/phosphate backbone and the daunosamine atoms which have the highest temperature factor show up very clearly. In the present structure, the additional substituting chain at the N3 H position should be a cyanomethyl and a methoxyethyl groups. The omit maps Fo±Fc (Fig. 4) calculated without including the contribution of the glycoside and its substituent along with solvent molecules, unambiguously outline the daunosamine. From N3 H atom, there are two continuous and well defined additional residual densities. The first one is directed toward DNA strand B and the second toward strand A (Fig. 4). The building up of

the methoxyethyl group inside the first residual Fo±Fc density is straightforward. The group fits inside the electron density Ê maps with an average temperature factor of 24.5 A2 which is similar to the average temperature factor of the solvent molecules. The methoxyethyl O1 HH atom does not participate in hydrogen bonding with DNA or water molecules. Nevertheless numerous van der Waals interactions between the methoxyethyl chain and A9 and T10 are observed. The shortest Ê distance of intermolecular contacts is 3.5 A between C5 H and O4 H (T10) (Table 3). As far as the second residual Fo±Fc density is concerned, after modelling and several refinement steps, only the cyanomethyl C3 HH and C7 HH atoms may fit inside the densities but N8 H definitely does not. N8 HH not only lays outside the electron density maps but also at very short distances from O4 H (C5) Ê Ê (2.2 A) and O2(T4) (2.3 A). The omit maps of the complex obtained with other crystallization conditions lead to the same

result. Those close contacts cannot result in a covalent link leading to a cross-link between drug and DNA, because there is no continuity in the respective electron density maps. Furthermore, a covalent link between the cyano derivatives of doxorubicin or daunomycin and a hexanucleotide needs the presence of a guanine residue at the central step [14,32±34]. After testing different models, the electron density maps are best consistent with a hydroxymethyl group. In this case, C3 HH and O7 HH properly fit the 2Fo±Fc and Fo±Fc Fourier difference maps and the average temperature factor of this chain is Ê 23.5 A2. Moreover, the hydroxyl O7 HH atom is involved in three Ê Ê hydrogen bonds with O4 H (C5) (2.8 A), O2(C5) (3.1 A) and Ê O2(T4) (2.7 A). We propose a model with the release of the cyano group to form the immonium ion. Nucleophilic addition of water would explain the formation of observed CMDa (Fig. 5). Such a release of the cyano group has already been observed for other drugs bound to DNA. Ishiguro et al. [35]

detected this release from saframycin A (SA) by radioactivity techniques when SA is bound to DNA at pH 5.6. They assumed that an immonium or an a-carbinolamine species is involved in the interaction with DNA. Afterwards, Lown et al. [36] proposed a model for the release of the SA cyano group under acidic catalysis. A cyclic immonium derivative is formed which could be covalently bound to DNA via a guanine residue or could become a carbinolamine compound. Ê Ettorre et al. [13] studied the X-ray structure at 1.6 A resolution of the crystal complex of the usual d(CGATCG) with an analogous compound of CMDa, the cyanomorpholinodoxorubicin (CMoDx). The CMoDx-d(CGATCG) and our complex are isomorphous. Ettorre et al. encountered a problem when modelling the cyanomorpholino moiety in its electron density maps. The amino sugar was clearly visible in the Fo±Fc omit maps, but the cyanomorpholino moiety did not appeared without ambiguity. Only a few atoms fitted the electron density maps around the N3 H atom, indicating a possible breakdown of the morpholino ring in the crystal. They interpreted their electron density maps as resulting from the CMoDx hydrolysis yielding N-(2-hydroxyethyl)doxorubicin (HyDx) [37]. The cyano group, added to perform the binding of the anthracyclines to DNA, is supposed to be released in order to permit DNA alkylation. However it seems that the cyano group disappears even without alkylation. The intercalation of CMDa or CMoDx in DNA seems to facilitate the conversion of the drugs into N-hydroxymethyl-N-(2methoxyethyl)-daunomycin (HMDa) and HyDx, respectively, even at physiological pH (between 5 and 7). The observed interactions between HMDa and d(CGATCG) are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. The direct hydrogen bonds, and those occurring via one water molecule between the aglycon and DNA in the DAU-d(CGATCG) complex, are maintained in the HMDa complex. The difference appears in the contacts between the daunosamine and DNA, as

for example the presence of an additional hydrogen bond Ê between O7 and N2(G8) (3.0 A). This is due to the daunosamine shifting toward DNA strand B (Fig. 6): there is a variation of the torsion angles (C1 H -O7-C7-C8) and (C7-O7C1 H -O5 H ). In the HyDx complex, the daunosamine slightly shifts toward the DNA strand B with the presence of a weaker Ê hydrogen bond between O7 and N2(G8) (3.4 A). The amino sugar displacement is a consequence of the presence of both the hydroxymethyl and methoxyethyl groups in the minor groove of the HMDa complex, whereas only the hydroxyethyl group is present in the HyDx complex. Because of the presence of the hydroxymethyl and methoxyethyl groups, the minor groove is nearly entirely occupied, which probably improves the inhibition of topoisomerase I activity. The DNA conformation in the HMDa and DAU complexes is similar (Table 4 and Table 5). Superposition of the double helix of both complexes does not show any significant Ê differences (rmsd = 0.7 A). The observation of the helical parameters in both complexes points out a buckle angle increase for the central step A3-T10/T4-A9 (26.88 in DAU complex vs. 211.68 in HMDa complex). We could explain this base displacements with a higher occupation rate of the minor groove near the central step. The similar increase is observed in HyDx complex (buckle angle of the central step of 211.88). The other base pair parameters and backbone torsion angles are globally the same for the DAU, HMDa and HyDx complexes. The sugar puckering mode keeps a C2 H -endo/C1 H -exo conformation. It seems that the addition of substituents at the N3 H position of daunomycin or doxorubicin does not considerably affect the global conformation of d(CGATCG). The presence of two bulky groups is counterbalanced by the daunosamine shift toward the DNA strand B and by an increase of the buckle angle at the central step. Studies of the cyano group behaviour for other N-cyanomethyl daunomycin derivatives complexed to d(CGATCG) are in progress. Preliminary results are available on an N-cyanomethyl-daunomycin complex as the simplest a±cyano amine from daunomycin and N,N-bis(cyanomethyl)-daunomycin.
