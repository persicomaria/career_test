The X-ray crystal structure of the fluoride derivative of Aplysia limacina ferric myoglobin has been solved and refined at 2.0 A resolution; the crystallographic R-factor is 13"6~/o. The fluoride ion binds to the sixth co-ordination position of the heme iron, 2"2 A from the metal. Binding of the negatively charged ligand on the distal side of the heme pocket of this myoglobin, which lacks the distal His, is associated with a network of hydrogen bonds that includes the fluoride ion, the residue Arg66 (El0), the heme propionate III, three ordered water molecules and backbone or side-chain atoms from the CD region. A comparison of fluoride and oxygen dissociation rate constants of A. limacina myoglobin, sperm whale (Physeter catodon) myoglobin and Glycera dibranchiata monomeric hemoglobin, suggests that the conformational readjustment of Arg66 (El0) in A. limacina myoglobin may represent the molecular basis fbr ligand stabilization, in the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor residue at the distal E7 position.

engineered human hemoglobin (Hb:~) and sperm whale (Physeter catodon) myoglobin (Mb; Olson et al., 1988). The substitution His E7 to Gly E7 has been shown to lower the oxygen affinity of sperm whale Mb and of the ~-subunits of human Hb, mainly due to the much faster rate of ligand dissociation (Olson et al., 1988}. Electron paramagnetic resonance (e.p.r.} spectroscopy of cobalt-substituted sperm whale Mb and human Hb, has indicated that the bound oxygen interacts with His E7 (IkedaSaito et al., 1977, 1978). Crystallographic investigations on native sperm whale oxyMb and human oxyHb (Phillips, 1980; Phillips & Sehoenborn, 1981; Shaanan, 1983) have shown that the dioxygen molecule is hydrogen-bonded to N ~ of His ET, and this © 1990AcademicPress Limited

hydrogen bond stabilizes the bound ligand by about 1-4kcal/mot (1 cal--4-184J; Olson et al., 1988; Perutz, 1989). Aplysia limacina Mb has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of sperm whale Mb; an overlay of the C~ chains of the two proteins (Bolognesi et al., 1989) shows a root-mean-square displacement of about 2"2 A (1 A=0.1 nm). However, the distal site of A. limacina Mb has an unusual structure: position E7 is occupied by Va163, and the polarity of the CD3-E3 ion-pair is reversed compared to sperm whale Mb. Residue CD3 is Asp45 and E3 is Lys59; position E11 is occupied by Ile67. Since the distal site of A. limacina Mb, in spite of the similarity in the overall tertiary structure, is very different from that characteristic of other heme proteins, we have studied the structurefunction relationships in this protein by thermodynamics, kinetics and X-ray crystallography (see Wittenberg et al., 1965; Giacometti et al., 1981; Boiognesi et al., 1982, 1989). Here, we report a crystallographic study of the fluoride derivative of A. limacina ferric Mb. It is shown that the role normally fulfilled by the distal His (E7) in stabilizing the bound ligand can be replaced by Arg66 (El0), which is long and flexible enough to reach the distal site; we propose that this interaction reduces the oxygen dissociation rate and thus helps to maintain a fairly high oxygen affinity. A. limacina ferric Mb was prepared from the buccai muscles of the gastropod as detailed (Rossi Fanelli & Antonini, 1957; Bolognesi et al., 1989). Glycera dibranchiata monomeric Hb {component II), prepared according to Kandler & Satterlee (1983) and Kandler et al. {1985), was a kind gift from Dr James D. Satterlee (Washington State University, Pullman, WA, U.S.A.). All chemicals (Merck AG,

Darmstadt, F.R.G.) were of analytical grade and used without purification. Crystals of the fluoride derivative of A. limacina ferric Mb were prepared by soaking the native prorein crystals in a saturated NaF solution, containing 3'2 M-ammonium sulfate in 0"05 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7"0). Binding of the ligand was monitored by following the variation of the absorption band in the Soret region by microspectrophotometry on single crystals. Diffracted intensities, collected at 2.0/k resolution, by means of an ENRAF-NONIUS CAD-4 diffractometer using one crystal, were processed as described (Bolognesi et al., 1989). The PROTEIN set of crystallographic programs was used for data handling and calculations of Fourier maps (Steigemann, 1974); crystallographic refinement was carried out according to the method of Tronrud et al. (1987), using the TNT program package and the interactive graphics program FRODO (Jones, 1978). After interpretation of the initial Fr)--F N and 2Fr)-FN difference electron density maps (where FD and F N are the structure factor moduli for the fluoride derivative and for the native ferric protein, respectively, and phases are thQse calculated from the refined A. limacina ferric Mb model (Bolognesi et al., 1989)), significant structural changes appeared in the distal site pocket. These include: a prominent peak 2-2 A from the heme iron, which represents the fluoride ion; conformational changes of the side-chains of Asp45 (CD3), Lys59 (E3) and Arg66 (El0); ordering of the heme propionate III and of three new water molecules located in the C-CD region of the distal pocket (see Fig. 1). The native A. limacina Mb starting-model (Bolognesi et al., 1989) was modified accordingly, and refined as described above. The crystallographic refinement process converged at an R-factor value

Figure 2 is a stereoscopic view of the distal site of the fluoride derivative of A. limacina ferric Mb, as seen from the solvent side. The hydrogen-bond network occurring at the distal site of the fluoride derivative of A . limacina ferric Mb is shown schematically in Figure3. In the structure of native A . limacina ferric Mb, the Arg66 (El0) side-chain is disordered after the C~ atom and points towards the solvent (Bolognesi et al., 1989). In the fluoride derivative of A . limacina ferric Mb, this residue is clearly defined in the distal pocket; this orientation can be achieved by extensive rotations around all the single bonds of the side-chain, and is not obstructed by intervening or neighboring residues, nor by Val63 (ET) or Ile67 (Ell). Asp45 (CD3) and Lys59 (E3) undergo readjustments as a result of becoming part of the network of polar interactions in the upper part of the distal pocket (see Fig. 3). The fluoride ion is 2-2 A from the heme iron, which moves almost completely into the heme plane compared to the A . limacina ferric Mb structure at the same pH, where the iron atom is pentaeoordinated and is displaced from the heme plane by 0"2 A towards the proximal His (Bolognesi et at., 1989). The porphyrin is more planar, and the azimuth of His95 (FS) is slightly changed; the His95 (FS) N L F e bond length is 2"3 A. Reorientation of Arg E l 0 from an external location to an internal interaction with the bound ligand has not been described before. I t shows that in A. limacina Mb, which lacks the distal His, anionic ligands can be stabilized by a mechanism

that is different from that reported for the dioxygen molecule in sperm whale Mb (Phillips, 1980; Phillips & Schoenborn, 1981 ). This unique structural feature may be correlated to the rates of dissociation of oxygen and fluoride. Table l shows a comparison of these rates in native and eobalt/porphyrin-substituted sperm whale Mb, A. limacina Mb and G. dibranchiata monomeric Hb. The rate constants vary according to the amino acid side-chains in the distal side of the heme pocket. In the absence of residues capable of forming hydrogen bonds with

The half-time of fluoride dissociation was estimated to be less than 7 ms, because the substitution was lost in the dead-time of the apparatus; thus, k> 1OOs -l, 0"1 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7"0), 20"0°C. 0'1 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7-0), 10-5°C (Yamamoto el al., 1974). f 0'1 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7"0), 4"0°C (Ikeda-Saito el al., 1978). 0"1 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7-0), 5"O°C(Ikeda-Saito et al., 1977). the bound ligand, as in the case of G. dibranchiata monomeric H b (Padlan & Love, 1974), the rate constants of fluoride and oxygen dissociation are very high. Next, ligand dissociation rates from A. limacina Mb are slower, consistent with partial stabilization by the Arg66 (El0) residue present in the distal side of the heine pocket. Finally, the dissociation rates of fluoride and oxygen from sperm whale Mb are the slowest, consistent with optimal interactions b y distal His E7 (Phillips, 1980; Phillips & Schoenborn, 1981). e.p.r, spectroscopy o f the o x y g e n a t e d d e r i v a t i v e of c o b a l t / p h o r p h y r i n substituted heme proteins has indicated the absence of interactions between the dioxygen molecule a n d the distal residue in G. dibranchiata monomeric Hb; weak stabilization of the bound ligand was observed in A. limacina Mb and strong stabilization in sperm whale Mb (Ikeda-Saito et al., 1977, 1978). These e.p.r, d a t a have a functional c o u n t e r p a r t in kinetics, also shown in Table 1. In the absence of the distal His, A. limacina Mb has selected an alternative hydrogen-bond donor a m o n g the surrounding globin residues, to control the rate of ligand dissociation and to raise the ligand affinity, as c o m p a r e d to the values observed for G. dibranchiata monomeric H b . The g e o m e t r y of the E helix and the need for an apolar heine c a v i t y leave little choice a m o n g the a m i n o acid residues surrounding E7 and capable of such interactions. Only elongated side-chains at position E l 0 can interact with the bound ligand. In sperm whale Mb, residue E l 0 is Thr67 which cannot reach the bound ligand in the E7 Gly m u t a n t . This m u t a n t is characterized b y a v e r y fast oxygen dissociation rate c o n s t a n t ( k = 1 6 2 0 s - I , in f i l M - p h o s p h a t e buffer (pH 7"0), 20"0°C (OIson et al., 1988) see Table 1 for comparison). The very fast rate of oxygen dissociation from G. dibranchiata monomeric H b ( P a r k h u r s t et al., 1980), is consistent with the presence of Leu at E7; moreover, Lys a t El0, although positively charged, elongated and flexible, c a n n o t induce the same extensive network of hydrogen bonds formed by the guanidino g r o u p of Arg E l 0 in the fluoride derivative of A. limacina ferric Mb, and m a y , therefore, be unable to interact as p r o d u c t i v e l y with the bound ligand. Thus, the rate constant for fluoride dissociation from G. dibranchiata monomeric H b is greater t h a n 100s -1 as c o m p a r e d to the value of 10 s -1 determined for A . limacina Mb (see T a b l e 1 ). Our results show t h a t control of the same function (i.e. ligand dissociation in heine proteins) m a y be achieved b y totally different stereochemical mechanisms in homologous proteins with very similar t e r t i a r y structures. This result is of general interest because in other protein families where, within a highly conserved fold, residues at the active site m a y v a r y drastically, c o m p a r a b l e a m i n o acid replacements m a y occur. As an example, we quote the genetic repressors, where the c o m m o n helix-turn-helix motif interacts with DNA according to the s a m e broad general rules. Despite the overall structural similarity of the D N A - r e a d i n g heads, the detailed molecular events b y which different o p e r a t o r s recognize their repressors are specific and unique, and do not follow a general p r o t e i n - D N A reading code (Matthews, 1988; Wolberger et al., 1988).
