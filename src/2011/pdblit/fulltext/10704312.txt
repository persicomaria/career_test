Aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) activity has been found in different sulfate reducing organisms (Moura, J. J. G., and Barata, B. A. S. (1994) in Methods in Enzymology (Peck, H. D., Jr., and LeGall, J., Eds.), Vol. 243, Chap. 4. Academic Press; Romao, M. J., Knablein, ~ ¨ J., Huber, R., and Moura, J. J. G. (1997) Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 68, 121­144). The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from extracts of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (Dd) ATCC 27774, a sulfate reducer that can use sulfate or nitrate as terminal respiratory substrates. The protein (AORDd) is described as a homodimer (monomer, circa 100 kDa), contains a Mo-MCD pterin, 2 [2Fe­2S] clusters, and lacks a flavin group. Visible and EPR spectroscopies indicate a close similarity with the AOR purified from Desulfovibrio gigas (Dg) (Barata, B. A. S., LeGall, J., and Moura, J. J. G. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 11559 ­11568). Activity and substrate specificity for different aldehydes were determined. EPR studies were performed in native and reduced states of the enzyme and after treatment with ethylene glycol and dithiothreitol. The AORDd was crystallized using ammonium sulfate as precipitant and the crystals belong to the space group P6 122, with unit cell dimensions a b 156.4 and c 177.1 Å. These crystals diffract to beyond 2.5 Å resolution and a full data set was measured on a rotating anode generator. The data were used to solve the structure by Patterson Search methods, using the model of AORDg. © 2000

Molybdopterin enzymes function generally by transfer of an oxygen atom either to or from a physiological acceptor/donor molecule and are frequently referred to as oxotransferases or oxomolybdenum enzymes, for the vast majority possess a MoAO unit in their active sites. This group contains molybdopterin cofactor (Moco) generally associated with iron­sulfur centers and/or a flavin or heme center. The active site of this last group of enzymes has shown a diversity of molybdenum coordination environments. On the basis of spectroscopic data, sequence homology, and X-ray data, a classification was made into three families [1­9]. The first is the xanthine oxidase family with a (MCD)Mo VIOS active site and no protein ligands to Mo, then, the DMSO reductase family with a (MGD) 2Mo VIO active site and one protein ligand to Mo (cysteine, serine, or selenocysteine), including formate dehydrogenases and nitrate reductases. The third family consists of enzymes such as sulfite oxidases and assimilatory nitrate reductases, involving a (MPT)Mo VIO 2 active site with one cysteinyl-S ligand to Mo. A molybdenum aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) that converts aldehydes to carboxylic acids is a major enzyme component in sulfate reducing bacteria and has been first purified from D. gigas (Dg). The presence of molybdenum was first detected by EPR spectroscopy, that led to the discovery of its biological function [10 ­ 12]. Investigation of the mechanism of molybdenum containing enzymes has been considerably enhanced by the crystallographic determination of the 3D struc-

ture of the D. gigas molybdopterin containing AOR [13, 14]. This enzyme belongs to the xanthine oxidase family. We have extensively characterized this activity in D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774, a sulfate reducer that can use nitrate as an alternative respiratory substrate to sulfate. Also, we now report its crystallization and X-ray analysis, which, in combination with its detailed biochemical and spectroscopic characterization, will be a contribution toward the better understanding of the structure and function of members of the xanthine oxidase family of enzymes. MATERIALS AND METHODS
D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 was grown as previously described by Liu et al. [15]. The cell-free extract was obtained after cell disruption (using a Manton-Gaulin press at 9000 psi). The extract was centrifuged at 19000g for 30 min and then at 180000g for 75 min. All operations were carried out at 4°C starting from a cell-free crude extract. The purification scheme is not very different from the one used for the D. gigas enzyme and Table I condenses the different steps performed, specific activities and yield of purification. The optical index ratio A 280/A 320 3.6 was obtained for the pure protein. The iron content was determined by as a ferrous complex as described in [16]. Protein determination was made by the Lowry method [17]. The molecular mass of the aldehyde oxidoreductase and its purity was established by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad low molecular range markers for calibration. Activities were determined under aerobic conditions as described in [12] with DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol) as acceptor. Under these experimental conditions 1 enzymatic unit corresponds to 1 mol of DCPIP reduced per min [10 ­12]. UV/Visible absorption data were recorded on a Shimadzu UV2101PC split beam spectrophotometer using 1 cm optical path quartz cells. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) were recorded on a X-band Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer. Samples were cooled with helium gas by using a flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments, UK) [18]. AORDd EPR samples were prepared as follows (terminology based on xanthine oxidase work [23]): Resting signal--Untreated AOR (as isolated) that originates weak EPR signals presumed due to Mo (V); Slow signal--Long treatment of AOR with dithionite (15 min) makes the resting signal to decline and to be replaced by an active EPR species, designated as a "slow" signal in analogy with the signals obtained in xanthine oxidase; Rapid signal--Mo (V) EPR signals were generated in the presence of dithionite (short reduction time), dithiothreitol or aldehydes and assigned to catalytic competent species; Desulfo-inhibited signal--Reaction of the enzyme with a high concentration of ethylenoglycol (0.4 M) for an extended period of time

(30 min) in a sample where a slow type signal was developed, originating the appearance of a new Mo (V) species. In initial attempts, hexagonal crystals were obtained in ammonium sulfate or sodium/potassium phosphate and 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), which, however, diffracted to less than 3.0 Å resolution. The crystal quality could be improved through the addition of variable amounts of dioxane to the crystallization solution. The best crystals were grown using a solution containing 1.8 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) and 10% dioxane. Drops were prepared by mixing 4 l of this solution with 4 l of a 15 mg/ml protein solution in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Single crystals appeared within three to four weeks and were stabilized by increasing the ammonium sulfate concentration to 2 M, while keeping the dioxane concentration at 10%. The crystals are red-brownish and have the shape of hexagonal prisms that grow up to dimensions of 0.4 0.2 0.2 mm 3. These crystals diffract to beyond 2.5 Å resolution on a rotating anode generator and were characterized as belonging to space group P6 1,522 with cell dimensions a b 156.4 Å and c 177.1 Å. The solvent content is approximately 60% [19] assuming one monomer in the asymmetric unit, which corresponds to a packing density of 3.1 Å 3/Da. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a MAR-Research Imaging Plate system using graphite monochromated Cu-K radiation from an Enraf-Nonius rotating anode generator operated at 4.5 kW. A complete data set was collected from a single crystal, with a crystal-to-detector distance of 200 mm, by rotating the crystals around the c-axis randomly oriented and with a rotation of 1° per image and an exposure time of 1200 s each. Intensity data were processed using Denzo and data reduction was performed with Scalepack, both programs from the HKL suite [20]. The relevant crystallographic data statistics are given in Table II. Although the crystals diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution, it was only possible to process the data to 2.8 Å, due to the poor statistics observed in the last resolution shell. The crystal structure was solved with the program package AmoRe [21] using the homologous AOR from D. gigas (MOP) as a search model.

FIG. 1. The different types of Mo(V) signals detected by EPR spectroscopy. Conditions of measurement were: temperature, 100, 54, and 35 K; Modulation Amplitude, 0.90 mT; Microwave frequency, 9.63 Ghz; Microwave Power, 2.35 mW.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single band around 100 kDa, when the protein was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The molecular mass determined by gel filtration is around 200 kDa, suggesting that the AORDd is isolated as a homodimer. The iron content per monomer is 3.7, in agreement with the EPR studies (see below). A pH profile of the enzyme activity was made in different buffer systems prepared at the same ionic strength (50 mM)--pH range from 4.9 to 9.5--a bell-shaped curve indicated a maximum activity around pH 7.6. The DCPIP-dependent aldehyde oxidoreductase activity was studied in detail using different types of aldehydes. A steady state kinetic analysis (KM in M and V max in M/ min/mg) was made for acet-(250,950), propio-(12,420), butan-(105,295) and benzaldehyde(151,000). The enzyme is moderately inactivated by different compounds (nitrate, isopropanol, phosphate) and strong inhibited by arsenite (65% inhibition in the presence of 25 M benzaldehyde with 20 mM arsenite). The UV/Visible absorption spectrum of AORDd exhibits absorption peaks around 467, 420, 320 and 280 nm (spectrum not shown). This spectrum is very similar to those observed for the deflavo-forms of xanthine oxidase and AORDg [3, 4]. The Fe-S centers dominate the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of the oxidized en-

zyme but change upon reduction. The spectrum bleaching is observed when -mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol are added. The EPR spectrum of the protein shows contributions from Mo(V) and from reduced iron-sulfur centers. Different Mo(V) EPR signals can be generated and observed in this protein reflecting the reactivity and coordination versatility of the Mo site (Fig. 1). In the native form, weak EPR signals were detected, which were attributed to Mo(V) and named the "resting signal". This signal has not been further studied. Treatment of AORDd with small amounts of dithionite by a short time (10 sec incubation) originated a new Mo(V) signal centered at 1.971 and designated as "Rapid signal". This Rapid type EPR signal has been shown to be of physiological relevance, as it develops within the enzyme turnover time scale and it can also be visualised in the presence of aldehydes. This Mo(V) signal has been defined as a catalytically competent species that contains a sulfido ligand at the Mo site [22]. Treatment of AORDd with dithionite for a long time (15 min) induces the decline of the resting signal and its replacement by another EPR active species, named the "slow signal" or "desulfo signal". This is a noncompetent catalytic species (desulfo form) and occur upon the conversion of the sulfido ligand to an oxo ligand and results in the lost of the catalytic activity. A stable Mo(V) EPR signal was obtained by reacting the enzyme in the presence of a high concentration of ethylenoglycol for an extended period of time (30 min), similar to the one obtained in xanthine oxidase and designated by "desulfo-inhibited". In all types of signals, with the exception of the resting signal, two types of iron-sulfur centers, type I and type II, with different g values (Table III and Fig. 2) were observed. Panels A, B and C (Fig. 2) collect EPR spectra of AORDd obtained for three different reduction times and at temperatures ranging from 9 to 60 K. The complex spectra can be decomposed in three main contributions: iron­sulfur centers I and II, and a

central feature due to Mo(V) signals, detailed described before and better visualized at higher temperatures, where the Fe-S centers are broad due to relaxation and Mo(V) signals are under non saturating conditions. It is clear that the main EPR features are saturated at low temperature, at the indicated microwave power and that center I and II have different relaxation behavior. Clear splitting on the g max feature of center I is observed in all reducing conditions and the Mo(V) "slow" signal also show different splitting when compared at high and low temperatures. This complex pattern is assigned to magnetic interactions between the centers. The knowledge of the 3D structure of AORDg enabled the positioning of the metal sites within a framework for the detailed study of the magnetic interactions [23]. The atomic coordinates of the aldehyde oxidoreductase from D. gigas (MOP) were used as a search model to solve the structure of the AORDd. All attempts were made with space groups P6 1 22 and its enanthiomorph P6 5 22. For space group P6 1 22, the

first solution for the monomer, after the translation function, was found with a correlation coefficient of 0.475 and an R-factor of 0.416. After the AMoRe [21] fitting program, the correlation coefficient rose to 0.591 and the R-factor fell to 0.367; while the second solution remained with a correlation coefficient of 0.334 and an R-factor of 0.463. The first solution clearly stood out of the 20 different possible solutions tried by showing a correlation coefficient 1.8 times the standard deviation above the mean value. The refined values for the rotation and translation functions are 20.1°, 19.4°, 50.3° and t x 0.1942, t y 0.4149, t z 0.4434, respectively. The refinement of the correctly positioned molecule was initiated with the model still containing the MOP sequence and calculations were performed with X-PLOR (version 3.1f) [24], using the Engh and Huber dictionary of distance restraints [25]. After rigidbody and positional refinements, using data in the resolution range 10.0 to 2.8 Å, the R-factor decreased to 0.268, with an R-free of 0.326 (with no waters added). The R-free test set was calculated using 3% of randomly chosen data (935 reflections), which were omitted from the refinement. The current state of the refinement is summarized on Table IV. The full refinement and the determination of the gene sequence has been published elsewhere [26]. REFERENCES
