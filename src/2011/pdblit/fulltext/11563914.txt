SUMMARY The M, form of pyruvate kinase (M,-PK) was purified from human leucocytes by a new method involving a succession of two different Dyematrex agarose chromatographies . The main step consisted of an orange dye affinity column with elation by fructose-1,6-diphosphate . This purification procedure allowed us to obtain M,-PK with a specific activity of 433 1 .U ./mg of protein, i.e . a 188-fold purification with an overall yield of 33% . The homogeneity of this preparation was verified by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and double immunodi£fusion in Ouchterlony plates- Anti-M,-PK antibodies obtained from rabbit neutralized the enzyme activity . Their specificity with regard to other types of PK showed that anti-M,-PK also reacted with M,-PK but not with R-PK .

INTRODUCTION Pyruvate kinase (ATP : pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2 .7 .1.40, PK) is an important regulatory glycolytic enzyme which converts phosphoenol pyruvate into pyruvate and concomitantly ADP into ATP . Four different isozymic forms of pyruvate kinase (L, R, M, and M 2 ) are present in human tissues . Their expression differs from one tissue to another [1] . These isozymic forms exhibit differences in electrophoretic, kinetic and immunological properties . L-Type PK (L-PK) specific of the liver and R-PK specific of the red blood cell (RBC) are encoded by the same gene but their mRNAs differ [2] . Two other types of PK, the M,-PK located in skeletal muscle and the M, PK widely distributed in most mammalian tissues [3], display immunological cross-reactivity . The M2 -PK is considered to be the prototype PK, whereas the other isozymes are regarded as differentiated forms 11, 3] . Human M 2 -PK has previously been purified from human lung and kidney [4, 5] by classical ionexchange chromatographic methods ; Harkins et al. [5] included a dye ligand 0378-4347/86/$03 .50 © 1986 Elsevier Science Publishers B .V .

chromatography step, but the overall yield was low . Conversely, human R-PK and L-PK have already been purified by various methods, including dye ligand chromatography [6, 7] . Our aims were to develop a rapid and simple method for the purification of M 2 -PK from leucocytes by using dye ligand chromatography, and to obtain anti-M 2 -PK antibodies .
EXPERIMENTAL

All substrates and commercial enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (F .R .G .) unless otherwise specified ; a-cellulose Sigma Type 50 and NADH were products of Sigma (St . Louis, MO, U .S .A .) . Acrylamide, bis-acrylamide and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DIFP) were supplied by Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) . Dyematrex gel blue A and orange were from Amicon (Lexington, MA, U .S .A .) . Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, U .S .A .) . Buffer salts were from Merck (Darmstadt, F .R .G .) . Cellogel strips were purchased from Medical Products, Chemetron (Milan, Italy) . Nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (pore size 0 .45 pm) were purchased from Sartorius (Gbttingen, F .R .G .) and affinity-purified goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H + L) horseradish peroxidase conjugate from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA, U .S .A .) . PK was assayed by the classical method using the reaction coupled with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, as previously described [8] . Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and LDH were assayed by the method recommended by the international committee for standardization in haematology [9] . Protein concentrations were measured according to the method of Lowry et al . [10], with bovine serum albumin as the working standard . Samples were concentrated in ultrafiltration cells obtained from Amicon (Lexington, MA, U .S .A .) . Electrophoresis Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to the method of Laemmli [11] . The proteins were stained with Coomassie blue . Cellogel electrophoresis was performed in 0 .075 M Tris maleic acid sodium hydroxide buffer (pH 5 .5) at 4°C for 3 h at 180 V, as previously described [12] . After completion of electrophoresis, one strip was stained for PK activity . The second strip was used for immunoblotting on NC according to the method developed for bisphosphoglyceromutase [13] . Then immunodetection of PK was performed on the NC using specific anti-M 2 -PK antibodies coupled to anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate .

Immunological studies The anti-M2 -PK antiserum was obtained from rabbit . The animal received 1 .25 mg of a completely purified enzyme by intramuscular injection . The first injection contained 0 .25 mg of purified M 2 -PK emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant, and the four subsequent injections each contained 0 .25 mg of enzyme emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant . The first three injections were made every fifteen days. After a three-month gap, two injec-

45

tions were made one week apart . A further week later, the rabbit was killed and the blood collected . The serum was heated for 30 min at 56 ° C and stored frozen . The anti-M 2-PK antiserum was tested by double-immunodiffusion technique according to the method of Ouchterlony [14] . lmmunoneutralization was performed according to a method previously described for R-PK [12] . The samples were mixed with increasing concentrations of anti-M 2 -PK antiserum in 100 mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 8 .0) containing 100 mM potassium chloride, 0 .1 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM e-amino-n-caproic acid, 1 mM DIFP, 0.1 mid dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine albumin and 500 mM sucrose. After incubation for 1 h at 37 ° C and overnight at 4°C, the tubes were centrifuged at 20 000 g and the residual PK activity was assayed in the supernatant .
Purification procedures

The complete purification procedure is summarized in Table I and the different steps are described below. Isolation of leucocytes and preparation of the crude extract . Enriched leucocyte preparations were obtained by leucopheresis . Contaminating RBCs were eliminated by selective lysis as described by Kahn et al . [151 . The leucocytes washed with cold 0 .9% sodium chloride containing 2 mM c-amino-ncaproic acid and 2 mM EDTA, were lysed with a homogenizer in two volumes of ice-cold buffer A (see following step) . Cold toluene was added up to a 10% (v/v) concentration and vigorously emulsified with the extract . After centrifugation for 60 min at 20 000 g, the upper fatty layer was drawn off and the clear supernatant was used for the purification of PK . All the steps of the purification procedure were done at 4 ° C . Unless otherwise indicated, all the buffers contained 0 .4 mM EDTA, 2 mM e-amino-ncaproic acid and 0 .5 mM dithiothreitol. Dyematrex gel blue A column chromatography . A 9-ml volume of a . crude extract was applied on a Dyematrex gel column (3 .5 X 1 .5 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7 .0 containing 5 mM magnesium sulphate and 0 .1 mM FDP) . The flow-rate was 100 ml/h .

A protein peak that did not contain PK activity was eluted with 200 ml of buffer A . Then 150 ml of a potassium chloride gradient (0 to 500 mM) were applied to the column, and M 2 -PK began to be eluted at ca. 66 mM potassium chloride . Fractions with high PK activity were pooled . Ammonium sulphate fractionation. The PK-containing eluate from the Dyematrex blue A column was brought to 50% ammonium sulphate saturation by adding solid crystals . The pH of the solution was maintained at 7 .0 by dropwise addition of 1 M sodium hydroxide . The solution was left for 30 min, then centrifuged at 27 000 g for 30 min . The pellet was discarded . The supernatant was brought to 75% ammonium sulphate saturation by adding solid crystals and left for 30 min before centrifugation at 27 000 g for 30 min . Then the pellet was dissolved in a small amount of buffer B (see following step) . The M 2 -PK isozyme can be stored for at least six weeks at -80 ° C as 75% saturated ammonium sulphate suspension without any significant loss of activity. Dyematrex gel orange column chromatography.

column (3 X 1 cm) was equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 7 .0) containing 5 mM magnesium chloride (buffer B) . The flow-rate was 25 ml/h . The ammonium sulphate precipitate from the previous step was dialysed against buffer B and applied to the orange column, allowed to penetrate and left there overnight . It was necessary to leave the enzyme in contact with the resin for such a long time to minimize the outcome of PK with buffer B . The following day, the column was washed with buffer B until no more protein was eluted . After the column had been washed with buffer C (identical with buffer B except for its containing 25 mM potassium chloride and the pH being 8 .5), a second protein peak showing less than 10% activity was eliminated . Then 0 .25 mM NADH was added to buffer C to promote the elution of the last

48 contaminants, GAPDH and LDH (see Fig . 1, lane 6) . The M 2 -PK was eluted with buffer C containing 0 .5 mM FDP. Tubes containing the highest enzymatic activity were pooled . The M,-PK was highly purified (Fig . 1) . The eluted PK was concentrated in an ultrafiltration cell to a final volume of 1 ml, and sucrose was added to a final concentration of 500 mM to protect PK activity . Vile first tried to elute M 2 PK with FDP just after washing the column with buffer C, but SDS-PAGE showed that the M 2 -PK eluate contained contaminants (Fig . 1, lane 6) . A search of the enzymatic activities of proteins of molecular weight approximately similar to these contaminants revealed that LDH and GAPDH were responsible . Thus we used a common substrate NADH to promote their elution before the specific elution of M 2 -PK by FDP .
RESULTS

The purity of the enzyme was tested by SDS-PAGE . Fig . 1 illustrates the various purification steps and shows that the main step is Dyematrex orange chromatography (lane 5) . This also appears in Table I : after the first two steps, the enzyme was purified nine-fold while the Dyematrex orange chromatography allowed an increase in specific activity of more than twenty-fold in one step . The final result of the purification procedure is an enzyme purified 188fold with an overall yield of 33% and a specific activity of 433 I .U ./mg of protein .

antiserum are shown in Fig . 2 . A single precipitation line was seen with the pure enzyme, as with the crude leucocyte extract and with a human muscle extract containing M,-PK . No precipitation line was seen with the R-PK from human RBCs . Immunodetection after cellogel electrophoresis is shown in Fig . 3 . The M2 -PK electrophoresis pattern of a crude extract is the same as those obtained by immunodetection or enzymatic staining : a single band migrating at the same level is obtained by these two different methods . Conversely, R-PK from RBCs appears by enzymatic staining but not by immunodetection with the anti M 3 -PK antiserum . Immunoneutralization . As can be seen in Fig . 4, M2 -PK was almost completely neutralized by anti-M2 -PK antiserum, and under our conditions 50% inhibition was obtained with ca . 1 .5 pl of antiserum . On the contrary, the anti-M2 -PK antiserum did not neutralize R-PK activity . By extrapolating the linear portion of the curve of neutralization, a titre of 5 .3 I .U . of neutralized M 2 -PK per millilitre of antiserum was obtained .

The activity is expressed as a percentage of the original activity . No inhibition of PK activity occurred with preimmune rabbit serum (not shown) . DISCUSSION Purification of human M 2-PK is difficult because this enzyme is unstable . Thus it is important to use a rapid procedure to purify this enzyme . In this paper we have reported a new chromatographic procedure based on successive columns of Dyematrex gels . The method, which involves three steps, has several advantages . It is fast and easy to handle, and the columns have a very small volume and can be used several times (at least five) with a good reproducibility . The 33% yield we have obtained is good for human M 2 -PK compared with those of Harkins et al . [5] and Corcoran et al . [4], who obtained 3 .7% in kidney and 4% in lung, respectively . Our better yield can probably be

50 explained by the rapidity and the small number of steps . We selected Dyematrex blue A for the first step because it binds M,-PK tightly and because it binds a large amount of protein compared with Dyematrex orange (see Table I) . This allowed us to process a large sample . The ammonium sulphate fractionation had several purposes : (1) elimination of FDP used as a protector in the first step but as a specific ligand for elution of M,-PK from the next column ; (2) elimination of an eventual contamination by R-PK [16] from red cells remaining with the leucocytes ; (3) concentration of the eluate . The determinant step of the procedure is the orange dye chromatography, which requires FDP to elute M 2 -PK from the column . FDP is an allosteric activator of M2 -PK [5] . This activator breaks the link between the orange dye and M,-PK, probably by promoting a conformational change of M 2 -PK, as previously observed by Marie and Kahn [6] for R-PK purification . The purity of the enzyme was checked by SDS-PAGE (Fig . 1) and double immunodiffusion (Fig. 2) . The antibodies obtained cross-react with the M l -PK from human muscle but not at all with R-PK from RBCs by any method we used : double immunodiffusion, immunoneutralization and immunodetection after cellogel electrophoresis . Similar results were obtained by Harkins et al . [5] in human and by Imamura et al . [3] in rat . In conclusion, the described method of purification of human leucocyte PK allows us to obtain in a short time a purified M 2 -PK with a yield of 33% (a good yield for this enzyme) . With this purified M 2 -PK, antibodies were raised in rabbit, with a titre high enough to allow high sensitivity immunodetection and immunoneutralization .
