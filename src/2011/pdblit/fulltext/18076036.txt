INTRODUCTION Lipoic acid (6,8-thioctic acid or 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid), an essential cofactor, is required for the proper function of several multicomponent enzyme complexes that catalyze key metabolic reactions in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.1 The enzyme complexes that are post-translationally modified by lipoylation include pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage system.2 The free carboxyl group of lipoic acid is covalently attached via an amide linkage to the e-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the lipoate-accepting protein domain (termed the lipoyl domain) of these multienzyme complexes.3 The lipoamide arm protruding from the lipoyl domain shuttles reaction intermediates among different active sites of the multienzyme complexes.2 Although the general role of lipoic acid as the covalently attached coenzyme has been known for decades, the mechanisms by which lipoic acid is synthesized and becomes linked to its cognate proteins continue to be elucidated. In many bacteria including Escherichia coli, two independent lipoylation pathways exist.4 The first pathway depends on lipoate-protein ligase A (LplA), which utilizes exogenously supplied free lipoic acid to modify a specific lysine residue of the lipoyl domain. The lipoylation reaction catalyzed by LplA is analogous to that of the biotinylation reaction mediated by biotinyl protein ligase (BPL).2,3 In the first step of the LplA-catalyzed reaction, the activated intermediate lipoyl-50 -adenylate (lipoylAMP) is synthesized from lipoic acid and ATP. In the

next step, the e-amino group of the lysine of the lipoyl domain attacks the enzyme-bound lipoyl-AMP to form an amide linkage. Others and we have reported the three-dimensional structures of LplA in the presence or absence of lipoic acid and lipoyl-AMP.5­7 The second lipoylation pathway is dependent on the lipB and lipA genes.8 The lipB gene product (LipB; lipoate-protein ligase B) is an octanoyl-[acyl carrier protein]-protein Noctanoyltransferase, which uses octanoyl thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) of fatty acid synthesis as the acyl donor in vivo.1 After the octanoyl group is transferred to the lipoyl domain by LipB, the sulfur insertion into the octanoyl moiety is catalyzed by LipA, the sulfur insertion protein. It was shown that the transfer of lipoic acid and octanoic acid from their ACP thioesters to lipoyl domains can also be catalyzed, albeit very poorly, by LplA.9 Despite very low levels of sequence identity, an evolutionary relationship among LipB, LplA, and the BPL module of biotinylating enzymes was suggested by sequence analysis.2 However, a detailed pathway of the reaction catalyzed by LipB differs from the reactions catalyzed by LplA and BPL. It was reported that the LipBcatalyzed reaction proceeds through an acyl-enzyme

Octanoic Acid Binding by LipB

intermediate in which the octanoyl moiety forms a thioester bond with the thiol of Cys169 in E. coli.10 Recently the first three-dimensional structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtu) LipB enzyme was reported and Mtu LipB was proposed to function as a cysteine/lysine dyad acyltransferase.11 In the Mtu LipB structure, the recombinant enzyme was irreversibly inhibited by a covalent attachment of decanoic acid to Cys176 via a thioether linkage probably as a result of post-translational modification in E. coli.11 Thus, the carboxylate moiety of the bound decanoic acid is a little separated from the proposed catalytic residues Cys176 and Lys142 due to the presence of two extra methylene groups in decanoic acid compared with octanoic acid. Furthermore, attempts to crystallize the apo form of Mtu LipB failed.11 To obtain a better view of the substrate recognition by LipB, we have determined the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus (Tth) LipB, a 217-residue protein, in complex with octanoic acid (and its analogs) as well as in the ligand-free form. The amino acid sequence of Tth LipB shows 35% and 42% identity with those of the E. coli and Mtu LipB enzymes, respectively. The sequence identity between the E. coli and Mtu LipB enzymes is 34% [Fig. S1]. Our structures of Tth LipB determined in this study complement the structural information on Mtu LipB.

and 100 mM NaCl. Fractions containing Tth LipB were concentrated to 18 mg mL21 using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore). The procedure preparing the selenothethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein was the same except that the protein was overexpressed in E. coli B834(DE3) cells, using M9 cell culture medium that contained extra amino acids including SeMet.
Crystallization and X-ray data collection

The lipB gene (TTC1746) from T. thermophilus was cloned into the expression vector pET-28b(1) (Novagen). This construct adds a hexa-histidine-containing 20-residue tag to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein, which was overexpressed in E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) pLysS cells using Terrific-Broth culture medium. Protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside and the cells were incubated for additional 18 h at 258C following growth to mid-log phase at 378C. The cells were lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 50 mM imidazole. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 36,000g for 60 min. The supernatant was applied to an affinity chromatography column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agrose (Qiagen). The protein was eluted with the lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole and the eluted sample was diluted fivefold with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol). The diluted sample was applied to a Source 15Q ionexchange column (GE Healthcare Bio-Science), which was previously equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 021.0 M NaCl in buffer A. The next step was gel filtration on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-200 prep-grade column (GE Healthcare Bio-Science), employing an elution buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.2

Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 248C by mixing equal volumes (2 ll each) of the protein solution (at 18 mg mL21 concentration in 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.2 and 200 mM NaCl) and the reservoir solution. To grow crystal of the native protein in the apo form, we used a reservoir solution consisting of 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0, 4.0 M lithium chloride, and 5% (v/v) PEG 8000. Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0.2 mm 3 0.2 mm 3 0.3 mm within a few days. To obtain crystals of the native protein bound with octanoic acid, octyl aldehyde, and 1-octanol, we soaked the apo crystals of the native protein in the reservoir solution containing 1 mM of each ligand for 12 h. The SeMet-substituted protein in the apo form was crystallized under conditions identical to those for the apo crystals of the native protein. A crystal of the SeMet-substituted protein was frozen in the cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. No cryoprotection was necessary, as the high concentration of lithium chloride in the mother liquor acted as a cryoprotectant. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD area detector system at the BL-4A experimental station of Pohang Light Source, Korea. For each image, the crystal was rotated by 18 and the crystal-to-detector distance was set to 190 mm. The raw data were processed and scaled using the program suit HKL2000.12 The SeMet-substituted crystal belongs to the space group P41212, with unit cell parameters of ° ° a 5 b 5 63.89 A, c 5 114.18 A. There is one LipB monomer per asymmetric unit, giving a solvent fraction of 46.4%. X-ray diffraction data from the native crystals in both the apo and ligand-bound forms were collected essentially as above. Table I summarizes the data collection statistics.
Structure determination and refinement

We have solved the crystal structure of Tth LipB by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing ° at 2.10 A resolution (Table I). Both of the two expected selenium atoms in each monomer of the recombinant enzyme were located with the program SOLVE,13 and the selenium sites were used to calculate the phases with RESOLVE.14 Phasing statistics are summarized in Table I.

by the automatic model building program RESOLVE, which gave an initial model that accounted for 80% of the backbone of the polypeptide chain with much of the sequence assigned. Subsequent manual model building was done using the program COOT.15 The model was refined with the program REFMAC,16 including the bulk solvent correction. 10% of the data were randomly set aside as the test data for the calculation of Rfree.17 Subsequently, this model was used to refine the apo and ligand-bound structures of the native enzyme. All of the models have excellent stereochemistry, as evaluated by the program PROCHECK.18 Table I summarizes the refinement statistics. In all models, Thr124 is the only outlier in the Ramachandran plot (Table I). It is well

defined by the electron density and its unusual backbone conformation may be associated with its location between two proline residues, Pro123 and Pro125. The sequence of this region is not well conserved in Mtu LipB [Fig. S1].

are well defined by the electron density [Fig. 1(A)]. The apo and ligand-bound structures are highly similar to each other, with root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations ° among the models ranging between 0.09 and 0.19 A. This suggests that binding of octanoic acid (or its mimics) to Tth LipB causes no significant conformational changes. The LipB monomer is oblate-shaped, with approxi° ° ° mate dimensions of 33 A 3 33 A 3 40 A [Fig. 1(B)]. The central core comprises two b-sheets: a larger sevenstranded b-sheet and a smaller three-stranded b-sheet. The larger sheet consists of seven b-strands with topology :b10:b1:b2;b6:b9;b8:b7 and the smaller sheet consists of three b-strands with topology ;b4;b3:b5. The two sheets are roughly orthogonal, diverging from each other at the octanoic acid-binding site [Fig. 1(B)]. Six a-helices surround the central b-sheets and the residues 52255 form a 310 helix.

ture, the highest Z-score is obtained with Mtu LipB11 ° (PDB code 1W66; an r.m.s. deviation of 1.5 A for 198 equivalent Ca positions, a Z-score of 29.7, and a sequence identity of 41%). The next highest Z-score is obtained with the Thermoplasma acidophilum (Ta) LplA6 ° (PDB code 2ARS; an r.m.s. deviation of 2.6 A for 184 equivalent Ca positions, a Z-score of 17.8, and a sequence identity of 22%). Tth LipB is shorter at its Cterminus by 28 residues, thus lacking the two C-terminal helices of Ta LplA.6 The overall structure of Tth LipB is also similar to that of the N-terminal domain of BPL from Pyrococcus horikoshii21 (PDB code 1WNL; an r.m.s. ° deviation of 2.3 A for 153 equivalent Ca positions, a Z-score of 15.4, with and a sequence identity of 15%). These results support an evolutionary relationship among LipB, LplA, and the BPL module of biotinylating enzymes.3

Recognition of octanoic acid by LipB

Octanoic acid, octyl aldehyde, and 1-octanol bind to the same site in essentially the same manner, thus defining the active site of Tth LipB [Fig. 1(B)]. Their aliphatic chains are buried deeply inside the substrate-binding pocket in the interior of the protein, with only the terminal polar atoms being exposed to the bulk solvent. When we overlap lipoic acid onto the octanoic acid bound to Tth LipB, only a small adjustment of the side chains at the bottom of the octanoic acid-binding pocket would allow accommodation of the dithiolane ring of lipoic acid. This could explain the lipoyl-transferase activity of E. coli LipB.9 The carboxylate moiety of octanoic acid interacts with the side chain O2 atom of the strictly conserved Lys136 [Fig. S1, marked by a blue triangle below the sequences] as well as the main chain nitrogen atom and side chain OD2 atom of Asp78, which is not well conserved among other LipB enzymes. The side chain of Asp78 in turn interacts with Asn55 and Cys170 [Fig. 2(A)]. To assign the protonation states of the bound octanoic acid, Lys136, and Asp78 neutron diffraction or ultra high-resolution X-ray diffraction data are necessary. If both octanoic and Asp78 are negatively charged, the negative charges can be partially neutralized by the positively charged Lys136. There may also be a possibility that lithium ions may be present around the carboxylate moiety of octanoic acid and the side chain of Asp78, because the crystals were grown at a high lithium chloride concentration. However, we cannot easily detect lithium ions due to scarcity of electrons at the current resolutions. The carbonyl oxygen atom of octyl aldehyde and the hydroxyl oxygen atom of 1-octanol may occupy roughly the same position as the O1 atom of octanoic acid. The oxygencontaining termini and the carbon termini of octyl aldehyde and 1-octanol are hardly distinguishable from each

other with their electron density alone. However, it is reasonable to assume that the oxygen atoms of the ligands point toward the bulk solvent, considering the extreme hydrophobic nature of the inner-side of the substrate binding pocket and the interaction between the oxygen atoms of the ligands and the main chain nitrogen atom of Asp78, which directly interacts with the O1 atom of octanoic acid. The distance from the main chain nitrogen atom of Asp78 to either the hydroxyl oxygen of 1-octanol or the carbonyl oxygen of octyl aldehyde is ° ° 2.95 A or 3.01 A. In the recently reported structure of Mtu LipB,11 decanoic acid bound to the active site is covalently linked to Cys176 via a thioether bond between the sulfur atom of the thiol group and the C3 carbon atom of decanoic acid [Fig. 2(B)]. The binding mode of decanoic acid in Mtu LipB is highly similar to that of octanoic acid in Tth LipB for carbon atoms C3 through C10. However, the carboxylate moiety and the C2 atom of the bound decanoic acid stick outside the binding pocket,11 because the octanoic acid-binding pocket of Mtu LipB can accommodate only part of the more elongated aliphatic chain of decanoic acid. The carboxylate moiety of bound decanoic acid interacts with the main chain nitrogen atom of Lys79 in Mtu LipB.11 Lys79 of Mtu LipB is not well conserved in other members of the LipB family. It is replaced by Asp78 in Tth LipB or glutamine in other LipBs. Furthermore, the side chain of Lys79 of Mtu LipB points away from the carboxylate moiety of the bound decanoic acid and the strictly conserved Lys142 (corresponding to Lys136 of Tth LipB) does not interact directly with the carboxylate moiety of decanoic acid despite close proximity between them. Therefore, only limited information about the key interactions between the carboxylate moiety of the true substrate and the key active site residues of LipB is available from the structure of Mtu LipB.11

Implications for LipB catalysis

It was reported that the reaction catalyzed by E. coli LipB proceeds through an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which the octanoyl moiety forms a thioester bond with the thiol of Cys169.10 Mutational studies of E. coli LipB further suggested that the octanoyl-C169A LipB species were probably acylated at Cys147.10 To identify the reactive side chain other than Cys169 in E. coli LipB, we built a homology model of E. coli LipB using the Tth LipB structure as the template (SWISS-MODEL) [Fig. 2(B)]. The Mtu LipB structure can also serve as the template. In the homology model of E. coli LipB, Cys147 (corresponding to Val148 of Tth LipB, Fig S1) residing in a short loop between the strands b8 and b9 is predicted to be too far from the active site to form an alternative thioester linkage with octanoic acid [Fig. 2(B)]. Therefore, our modeling study does not support the previous

suggestion that the octanoyl-C169A species of E. coli LipB were probably acylated at Cys147.10 Cys137 of E. coli LipB is located closer to the carboxylate moiety of the bound octanoic acid than Cys147 in our homology model but the side chain of Cys137 points away from the bound octanoic acid in the homology model, thus making Cys137 unlikely to be acylated [Fig. 2(B)]. E. coli LipB species that lacked all three cysteine residues (Cys137, Cys147, and Cys169) also formed a catalytically incompetent octanoyl adduct, indicating the presence of a reactive side chain other than a cysteine thiol that lies adjacent to the active site.10 Our homology model of E. coli LipB suggests that Lys135 may provide the alternative reactive side chain for acylation [Fig. 2(B)]. The corresponding residue (Lys136) of Tth LipB is in close proximity to the carboxylate moiety of the bound octanoic ° acid (3.53 A between the NZ atom of Lys136 and the O2 atom of octanoic acid) [Fig. 2(A)]. Cys170 of Tth LipB is located on a loop between helices a4 and a5, covering the entrance to the active site. The equivalent residue of Cys170 of Tth LipB is Cys176 in Mtu LipB and Cys169 in E. coli LipB. In the structure of Mtu LipB, the reactive thiol group of Cys176 formed a thioether linkage with the C3 carbon atom of the bound decanoic acid.11 Unexpectedly, Cys170 of Tth LipB forms a disulfide bond in the crystal with the same residue of a neighboring molecule that is related by the crystallographic twofold symmetry axis. As a result, the thiol group of Cys170 points away from the active site in the crystal. The formation of this disulfide bond is apparently essential for the crystallization of Tth LipB, because we could not grow crystals when dithiothreitol (50 mM) was present in the crystallization medium. An unfavorable conformation of the loop containing Cys170 probably precluded the formation of a thioester linkage between its thiol group and the bound octanoic acid in the active site of Tth LipB in the crystal. The present structures can be regarded as open states trapped by an unexpected disulfide bond, which may be seen in initial steps of the reaction. Further structural studies are required to reveal the detailed reaction mechanism.
