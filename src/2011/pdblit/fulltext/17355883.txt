The peripheral stalk of ATP synthase holds the a3b3 catalytic subcomplex stationary against the torque of the rotating central stalk. In bovine mitochondria, the N-terminal domain of the oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein (OSCP-NT; residues 1­120) anchors one end of the peripheral stalk to the N-terminal tails of one or more a-subunits of the F1 subcomplex. Here we present the solution structure of OSCP-NT and an NMR titration study of its interaction with peptides representing N-terminal tails of F1 a-subunits. The structure comprises a bundle of six a-helices, and its interaction site contains adjoining hydrophobic surfaces of helices 1 and 5; residues in the region 1­8 of the a-subunit are essential for the interaction. The OSCP-NT is similar to the N-terminal domain of the d-subunit from Escherichia coli ATP synthase (d-NT), except that their surface charges differ (basic and acidic, respectively). As the charges of the adjacent crown regions in their a3b3 complexes are similar, the OSCP-NT and d-NT probably do not contact the crowns extensively. The N-terminal tails of a-subunit tails are probably a-helical, and so this interface, which is essential for the rotary mechanism of the enzyme, appears to consist of helix­helix interactions.

Introduction
The mitochondrial ATP synthase is a membranebound multisubunit enzyme that couples the proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the synthesis of ATP in the matrix.1,2 The enzyme has two major domains, a globular catalytic domain known as F1 (formed from subunits a, b, g, d and 3 in the ratio 3:3:1:1:1) that extends into the mitochondrial matrix, and a membrane domain known as Fo. The two domains are linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. The central stalk consists of

subunits g, d, and 3, and it contains an elongated a-helical coiled-coil, which penetrates into the a3b3 subcomplex along the axis of 3-fold pseudosymmetry. Its lower region is exposed between F1 and Fo, and its foot is intimately associated with a ring of c-subunits in the Fo domain.3 Catalysis in the b-subunits of the F1 domain depends upon the rotation of the ensemble of the central stalk and the associated c-ring.3­5 This rotation is driven by the passage of protons from the intermembrane space back into the mitochondrial matrix through the interface between the c-ring and another Fo component, subunit a.2,6 The peripheral stalk links subunit a to the external surface of the F1 domain, and is thought to act as a stator to counter the tendency of subunit a and the a3b3 subcomplex to rotate with the central rotary element.2,6,7 The peripheral stalk in bovine mitochondria consists of one copy of each of subunits OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein), F6, b and d.7 The presence of the OSCP8,9 and also of F610 has long been known to be required for a fully functional F1Fo-ATPase. The bovine mitochondrial peripheral stalk has been reassembled in vitro11 and visualized

OSCP N-terminal Domain

825 Here, the structure of the N-terminal domain of the bovine OSCP (OSCP-NT, residues 1­120) and its binding interface with an N-terminal tail of an a-subunit have been established by solution NMR methods.

by electron microscopy of single particles of the intact enzyme in negative stain.2,12 Similar features have been observed in bacterial13,14 and chloroplast ATP synthases,15 although their subunit compositions differ substantially from the mitochondrial enzyme, being composed of one copy of the d-subunit (homologous to the OSCP) and two copies of subunit b in eubacteria and of single copies of homologous subunits b and b 0 in photosynthetic bacteria and chloroplasts.16,17 Recently, the structure of the mitochondrial ATP synthase has been determined by electron cryo° microscopy of single particles to 32 A resolution, allowing a more precise definition of the peripheral stalk and suggesting how it might work.18 A schematic view showing the components of the peripheral stalk in the bovine enzyme and the relationship to the structures of F1Fo is shown in Figure 1. So far, detailed structural information about the peripheral stalk has come from studying individual components. The structure of the N-terminal domain of the d-subunit from Escherichia coli, the equivalent of the bovine OSCP,19 has been established by NMR studies,13 part of the E. coli b-subunit, which forms a homo-dimer, has been obtained by X-ray crystallography,20 and the NMR solution structure of bovine F6 subunit has been described.21 In the bovine enzyme, the N-terminal region (residues 20­80) of the single subunit b probably forms two transmembrane a-helices joined by a hydrophilic loop at the external surface.22 These helices are part of Fo, and the rest of the protein (residues 81­214) protrudes from the membrane towards F1, its C-terminal region interacting with the C-terminal region of the OSCP.11 Subunits d and F6 bind to the OSCP-b heterodimer,11 and the C terminus of the yeast equivalent of F6 (subunit h) has been localised close to the membrane surface by electron microscopy.23 The OSCP sits in or near the crown region on top of ° the F1 domain, and reaches out almost 100 A along the surface of F1 towards Fo.24 Mild trypsinolysis of isolated F 1 removes residues 1­15 from the a-subunit, and residues 1­7 from the b-subunits,25 and in contrast to untreated F1 -ATPase, the proteolysed F1 domain cannot bind the OSCP.26 Therefore, these regions, which extend up from the top of the crown region of the F1 domain,4 may provide specific binding sites for the OSCP. Similar experiments have been conducted with the E. coli enzyme,27 where the N-terminal region of the d-subunit interacts with the top of F1.13,28 Chemical cross-linking experiments in the bacterial, chloroplast and mitochondrial enzymes are consistent with this arrangement.29­31 Bovine OSCP binds to bovine F1 at one high affinity site (KdZ80 nM) and two lower affinity sites.32 In the E. coli enzyme, the binding affinity of the d-subunit to the a-subunit has been studied quantitatively by fluorescence,33,34 and its binding surface investigated by a combination of fluorescence and mutagenesis.35

Results
Production and characterization of proteins Both the bovine OSCP and OSCP-NT were produced at high levels by overexpression in E. coli (see Figure 2(a) and (c)). They formed inclusion bodies from which the proteins were refolded and then purified by ion exchange chromatography (Figure 2(b) and (d)). The N-terminal sequence of both proteins from residues 1­11 was determined to be MFAKLVRPPVQ, as expected. Their molecular masses measured by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry were 21,060.7 (s.d. 2.25) and 13,352.34 (s.d. 1.41), respectively, in agreement with the calculated values of 21,061.0 and 13,353.76. A five-fold molar excess of each protein was added separately to samples of bovine F1-ATPase and the protein complexes were separated from excess OSCP and OSCP-NT by gel filtration. With both proteins, 1:1 complexes, as judged by the staining on the gel, had formed with F1-ATPase (see Figure 2(f) and (g)). NMR properties of the OSCP and some fragments The full length recombinant bovine OSCP (1­190) and some of its fragments were tested for their suitability for study by NMR. Full length OSCP was rather insoluble and precipitated slowly even from dilute solutions. Both one and two-dimensional NMR spectra contained very broad signals throughout. These properties suggest that the protein aggregates. Variation of pH (2.3­8.0), temperature (300­315 K), buffer composition (phosphate, dithiothreitol, Hepes) and salt concentration (0 to 1 M NaCl) all failed to improve the NMR properties, and addition of trifluoroethanol36 did not disaggregate the protein. Similar problems have prevented NMR study of the full length d subunit of the E. coli enzyme.13 Fragments of the OSCP were also examined. By analogy with the d-subunit from E. coli ATP synthase,13 bovine OSCP is expected to comprise of two domains. Two C-terminal fragments (residues 93­190 and 121­190) had NMR properties similar to those of full length OSCP. In contrast, OSCP-NT had good solubility and NMR properties. However, avoidance of aggregation required a careful choice of conditions (pHO6.5, [NaCl]O500 mM). Solution structure of OSCP-NT The OSCP-NT is well-structured and largely a-helical with a relatively well-dispersed NMR

The three a-subunits and the three b-subunits are red and yellow, respectively, and the single g, d and 3-subunits, which form the central stalk, are blue, green and magenta, respectively.45 The foot of the central stalk is associated with a ring of c-subunits shown in pink solid representation. In S. cerevisiae, there are ten c-subunits in the ring,3 whereas the number of c-subunits in the ring in the bovine enzyme has not been established. This ring, together with subunit a and part of subunit b, form the essential components of the membrane domain of the enzyme where rotation of the central stalk and c-ring is generated from the proton motive force. The peripheral stalk connects subunit a and the external surface of the F1 domain. It consists of single copies of subunits OSCP, b, d and F6, with the approximate arrangement shown in the Figure. 21,23 The N-terminal domain of the OSCP is depicted as the approximately ovoid shape on the top of the F1 domain.

spectrum and abundant NH­NH backbone connectivities in nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra. Its 1H, 15N and 13C resonances were assigned essentially complete. From the NOESY-based spectra 1565 distance restraints were assigned, which together with 51 ambiguous nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)-based restraints formed the input data for the structure calculations. No hydrogen bond constraints were included in the input data, as there was no direct experimental evidence for their locations. The resulting ensemble of 44 accepted structures is shown in Figure 3(a), and the corresponding structural statistics are summarised in Table 1 and in the profiles shown in Figure 3(b). The termini of

the fragment (residues 1­10 at the N terminus and 116­120 at the C terminus) are unstructured, since they show significantly sharper NMR signals than others from the domain, and no medium or longrange NOE connectivities. Therefore, these residues were excluded from calculation of the structural statistics. The backbone precision of the calculated ° structures in the structured region is 0.75 A. The structure of OSCP-NT (Figure 4(a)) contains six a-helices (comprising helix 1, 13­28; helix 2, 33­47; helix 3, 50­56; helix 4, 64­74; helix 5, 82­90; helix 6, 99­115). Helices 1, 2, 5 and 6 are arranged as two intercalating V-shaped pairs that constitute the core of the structure. Helices 3 and 4 are packed tightly against this core, and the approximate

Interaction between OSCP-NT and peptides from the N terminus of the a-subunit A series of experiments was carried out in which various peptides from the a-subunit were added to solutions of isotopically labelled OSCP-NT and changes in the chemical shifts of OSCP-NT were monitored to establish which groups were affected. They comprised 15N titration experiments, that is a series of 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments in which 1H and 15N chemical shifts of backbone amide groups were monitored as a function of added peptide concentration, and also 13C titration experiments, in which 1 H and 13C chemical shifts of various CH groups were monitored as a function of added peptide concentration through a series of 13C HSQC experiments. Addition of a1-25 caused changes in the 15N HSQC spectrum that indicated that an interaction had occurred. Small additions (peptide:protein molar ratio 1:10 approximately) broadened many amide signals of OSCP-NT, and as further peptide was added towards a 1:1 molar ratio, they

broadened beyond the limit of detectability. Other signals, presumably those that were perturbed less strongly, underwent smooth changes in chemical shift (also accompanied by broadening) that could be followed as a function of added peptide. Overall, about 75% of the amide group signals of OSCP-NT were perturbed (either shifted, broadened or eliminated) by addition of the a1-25 peptide to a molar ratio of 1:1. These changes continued for peptide additions well beyond the 1:1 molar ratio, and saturation was reached at a peptide:protein ratio of approximately 6:1. These results suggest that this peptide­protein interaction occurs within the intermediate rate regime on the NMR chemical shift timescale, defined approximately by koffwDd where Dd is the frequency difference for a given signal between the free and bound states, and is typically not greater than a few 100 Hz. The 15N HSQC spectra at the start and end of this titration are shown in Figure 5(a). Several explanations are possible for the high molar ratio required to reach saturation in this titration. For example, the OSCP-NT could bind strongly to several peptide chains, such that the saturation molar ratio reflects the stoichiometry of the complex (if the concentration of the NMR solution is well above the Kd of the complex). However, as described below, the binding site for a1-25 mapped on OSCP-NT accommodates only one peptide chain, and in the interaction between the d and a subunits in the E. coli enzyme, a 1:1 stoichiometry was reported based on fluorescence measurements.34 Alternatively, OSCP-NT could bind a single peptide chain very weakly (if the concentration of the NMR solution is below the Kd of the complex). However, the observed intermediate rate of NMR exchange does not support this interpretation as a very weak interaction would be expected to exhibit fast exchange. Nor do either the need for the OSCP to be anchored to F1 by a relatively strong interaction capable of withstanding the rotational torque of the central stalk, or the Kd value of 130 nM for the interaction of the E. coli d subunit with E. coli a1-22.34 Therefore, perhaps the most plausible explanation is that multiple peptide chains are bound with different affinities, one of them strongly while one or more others make weaker interactions. If so, it might be expected that separable sets of perturbations would be observed at different stages in the titration, corresponding to successive occupation of each binding site. However, they were not, possibly because multiple binding sites could overlap on the structure, and also because the broadening and disappearance of a high proportion of the peaks restricts greatly the number of assignments that can be made for the bound state of OSCP-NT. Thus, these questions still lack definitive answers. Addition of the peptide a1-17 to 15N-labelled samples of OSCP-NT caused changes in the 15N HSQC spectrum similar to those seen for addition of a1-25 (data not shown), but the peptide:protein ratio attainable in this titration

was limited by poor solubility of the peptide. No additional residues of OSCP-NT were affected by the longer peptide, indicating that residues 18­25 of the a subunit are not involved

directly in binding of OSCP-NT. Addition of the peptide a9-17 did not perturb the 15N HSQC spectrum of OSCP-NT significantly, even at high molar excess (6:1 peptide:protein), showing that

831 region of helices 1 and 5 where there is a shallow groove. It has some hydrophobic character and exposed or partly exposed side-chains in this region include those of Ile14, Tyr18, Ala21, Leu22 and Ala25 on helix 1 and Pro80, Leu81, Leu85 and Leu88 on helix 5 (Figure 4(b)). Therefore, it seems likely that an N-terminal tail of an a subunit forms an a-helix that packs into this surface groove. It is also likely that at least part (residues 1­10, see above) of the disordered N-terminal tail of OSCPNT itself becomes partially ordered upon interaction with a1-25, since addition of peptide changes the chemical shifts for residues in this region in both the 15N and 13C titration data. Influence of peptides from b-subunits Several experiments were conducted to explore any possible influence of the N-terminal regions of b-subunits on the binding of OSCP-NT. Addition of the peptides b1-15 or b3-27 to OSCP-NT did not affect amide group chemical shifts except at peptide:protein molar ratios greater than 5:1, when minor effects were seen. They were ascribed to non-specific interactions since, first, the effects were small, second, the perturbed residues were distributed randomly in OSCP-NT, and third, different residues were perturbed by addition of b1-15 from b3-27 (data not shown). Addition of a1-17 and b1-15 together in either order to OSCPNT to final molar ratios of 1:9:9 (OSCP:a:b) led only to chemical shift changes also observed for addition of a1-25 alone. Therefore, b1-15 does not bind to OSCP-NT, even in the presence of a1-17. Finally, a1-17 and b1-15 were analysed by NMR in the absence of OSCP-NT, both individually and together, using two-dimensional 1H 1H-NOESY and TOCSY spectra. The peptides were unstructured and they did not interact.

residues in the region 1­8 of the a-subunit are crucial for the interaction. Residues in OSCP-NT with amide group chemical shifts influenced by addition of a1-25 are shown in Figure 5(b) and (c). The largest effects (amide signals with the biggest chemical shift changes, and those eliminated from the spectrum) correspond to residues concentrated mainly around the surfaces of helices 1 and 5, whereas the area around helices 3 and 4 is largely unaffected. However, other residues distributed throughout most of the structure of OSCP-NT are affected to some extent. Such widely distributed effects are common in 15N chemical shift titration experiments, and reflect the strong dependence of amide group 15N and 1H chemical shifts on hydrogen bonding strength and geometry. Similarly, small perturbations to the structure of a protein arising from ligand binding can cause diffuse amide group chemical shift changes that are not necessarily confined to the immediate vicinity of the binding site. Appreciable secondary effects of this nature occur when a1-25 binds to OSCP-NT. This situation was improved by analysis of 13C HSQC titration data, obtained by addition of a1-25 to samples of [15N, 13C] double-labelled OSCP-NT. Chemical shift changes observed for 13C­1H groups are often significantly smaller than those for amides, and 13C HSQC spectra are usually more crowded than 15N HSQC spectra, making assignment and analysis more difficult. However, in some cases these disadvantages are compensated by the perturbations of 13 C­1H group signals being intrinsically less prone to secondary effects than are those of hydrogen-bonded amides.37 Furthermore, effects on 13C­1H group chemical shifts often reflect specific side-chain interactions, and in a-helical proteins such as OSCP-NT, it is expected that the predominant interactions will involve side-chain atoms directly. As anticipated, the influences of a1-25 on the chemical shifts of CH groups in the OSCP-NT were more limited than the effects of the peptide on amide group chemical shifts, and few of the peaks were eliminated by broadening during the 13C titration (Figure 6(a) and (b)). Therefore, analysis was confined to those signals from OSCP-NT for which reliable assignments could be made both in the absence and presence of peptide. They comprised a high proportion of the methyl signals (60 of 82), of the aromatic signals (17 of 19 signals), and nearly half of the Ca signals (52 of 120); overall, 207 signals (from a total of 412 assigned in the absence of peptide) were assigned both in the absence and presence of peptide and were used in the analysis of the 13C titration data. As with the 15N titration data, saturation of the 13C chemical shift perturbations was reached at around a peptide:protein molar ratio of 6:1. Groups with 13C and 1H shifts changed by addition of the a1-25 to OSCP-NT are shown on surface representations of OSCP-NT in Figure 6(c) and (d). Most of the significant effects are in the

Discussion
The structure of OSCP-NT presented here is a bundle of six a-helices. It is very similar to the N-terminal domain of the d-subunit (d-NT) of E. coli F1-ATPase,13 as expected from the high degree of sequence similarity (Figure 4(d)). Almost all of the conserved hydrophobic residues (Tyr18, Ala19, Ala26, Leu32, Leu39, Met51, Ala52, Leu55, Leu85, Ile86, Ala90, Leu95, Val101 and Phe105 of bovine OSCP-NT) are involved in packing the helices together, and Tyr23, Leu32, Ile45, Leu69, Leu89, Ile102 and Met108 of bovine OSCP-NT are all substituted conservatively in E. coli d-NT. The backbones of helices 1, 2, 3 and 6 in the two domains superimpose closely (Figure 4(c)). However, the OSCP-NT has a moderate kink in helix 1 in the region of residues 22­24, which is apparently absent from the E. coli d-NT structure (this is a minimised average structure, in which helix 1 bends slightly over its whole length). This kink in helix 1 of OSCP-NT persists even if hydrogen

bonding constraints are added to the input for the structure calculations (data not shown), and its presence is consistent with the locations of residues with small side-chains (Ala21, Ser24 and Ala25) and a slight irregularity in the observed pattern of helical NOE connectivities in this region (the d(i,iC3)aN cross-peak linking residues 23 and 26 is weaker than others in the helix). Helix 4 has somewhat different positions in the two structures, corresponding mainly to a lateral shift of its helical ° axis through about 1.5­2.0 A while retaining approximately the same orientation. There is also a slight relative shift of helix 4 along its axis between the two structures, and similarly for helix 5. These relative differences between the positions of helices 4 and 5 are accommodated by differences in the loop connecting helices 3 and 4 and, to a lesser extent, that between helices 4 and 5 (which is shorter by two residues in E. coli d-NT). However, these loop regions are also disordered in both structures, and so detailed comparison is not

warranted. The overall backbone rmsd between the lowest energy structure of bovine OSCP-NT ° and the deposited structure of E. coli d-NT is 2.97 A a 0 (comparing the N, C and C atoms of residues 11­77, 79 and 81­114 of OSCP-NT against the corresponding atoms of residues 3­69, 70 and 71­104 of the E. coli d-NT). The binding site for a1-25 on the surface of OSCP-NT identified here comprises the largely hydrophobic groove between helices 1 and 5 of OSCP-NT. Based on the analysis of the binding affinities of the peptide to mutants of the d-subunit, a similar site on the surface of the d-subunit of E. coli was proposed to bind E. coli a1-22.34 The most likely mode of interaction is for the N-terminal tail of an a-subunit to form an a-helix that can pack into the surface groove on its interaction partner. Its dimensions on OSCP-NT are suitable for accommodating an a-helix maximally 10­12 residues long. Secondary structure predictions using the PSIPRED server38 indicate that residues 6­16 of the

Similar results were obtained for the N-terminal region of the E. coli a-subunit (confidence scores for helical prediction in the region of residues 5­22 are 4, 5, 5, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 5, 3, 1 and 1). In many of the crystal structures of bovine F 1-ATPase, the N-terminal regions of a-subunits that extend from the crown region of the a3b3 domain are largely disordered. However, in the structure of the enzyme inhibited by ADP and beryllium fluoride,39 residues 13­24 in the aDP-subunit form an a-helix that extends up from the crown. In the intact F1Fo-ATPase, it is likely that this helix continues further from residue 12 back to the vicinity of or even beyond residue 6. The lack of effect of a9-17 on the 15N HSQC spectrum of OSCP-NT indicates that residues 1­8 of a-subunits are involved in the interaction, but as the structure of the peptide is not known in either free or bound state, it cannot be excluded that the interacting region continues somewhat further in a C-terminal direction. The N-terminal sequences of a-subunits (Figure 4(e)) have a number of hydrophobic residues that could mediate the interaction. Which and how many of the three a-subunits (aDP, aTP and aE) is or are involved remains to be determined, as does the orientation of the N-terminal helix relative to its binding site. Another related issue is whether the binding groove and the bound a-peptide are sandwiched between OSCP-NT and the crown of F1, or whether, alternatively, the groove is on top of the F1FoATPase complex, with the N-terminal a-helical region of an a-subunit reaching up and over the OSCP-NT domain into its binding groove. Once the orientation of the peptide in the groove is known, it may be possible to resolve these alternative arrangements by docking the domain structure into the electron cryomicroscopy map of the bovine F1Fo-ATPase.18 Surprisingly, a comparison of the surface properties of the OSCP-NT and E. coli d-NT reveals that they are markedly different (Figure 7(a)­(d)). With the exception of the hydrophobic groove where the a-peptide binds, the surfaces of both structures are mostly polar, but that of the ordered portion of OSCP-NT is predominantly basic (including ten Lys and four Arg residues, but only seven Glu and one Asp residues), whereas in E. coli d-NT it is predominantly acidic (including 13 Glu and four Asp residues, but only two Lys and five Arg residues). In contrast, the surfaces of the crown regions of the bovine and E. coli a3b3 domains have similar distributions of polar residues (Figure 7(e)

OSCP N-terminal Domain

and (f)). This difference might imply that there are no specific interactions between the domains and the crown of F1 other than those mediated by the N-terminal peptides of a-subunits. It may be relevant that the binding of the d-subunit to E. coli F1 depends strongly on the concentration of magnesium ions,33 which might possibly act to bridge between negative charges on adjacent surfaces of the two interacting proteins. The influence of magnesium ions on the binding of OSCP-NT to bovine F1-ATPase has not been studied systematically, although they were present when the bovine F1-OSCP and F1-OSCP-NT complexes were prepared (Figure 2). The limited size of the interaction surface revealed by analysing the 13C titration data is most consistent with an interaction involving just one N-terminal tail in an a-subunit, but, as described earlier and in apparent contradiction to this, saturation of either the 15N or 13C spectral perturbations is not reached until a peptide:protein molar ratio of about 6:1. Given also that, in the intact ATP synthase, OSCP-NT must necessarily be located close to three N-terminal tails of a subunits, the most consistent interpretation is that one a chain associates with OSCP-NT with a relatively high affinity (causing the largest chemical shift perturbations, which are those that are interpreted here), and that this binding may be followed by weaker association of one or two further chains, perhaps involving overlapping parts of the OSCP-NT surface. Although the N-terminal tails of the b-subunits must be also in the vicinity of the OSCP NT in the intact enzyme, they do not participate in binding the OSCP. Another unresolved issue is whether the association of predominantly one a-chain with OSCP-NT is a permanent fixture, as seems likely, or whether the OSCP moves from one a-chain to another during the rotary catalytic cycle. If the former is correct, because the F1 domain is asymmetrical, F1Fo-ATPase assemblies will contain three different structural isomers,18 which would complicate the structural analysis of the intact enzyme complex.

Materials and Methods
Overexpression of bovine OSCP and OSCP-NT The coding sequences of the bovine OSCP (190 residues) and OSCP-NT (residues 1­120) were transformed into competent cells of E. coli C41(DE3) and BL21(DE3), respectively. Then single colonies were transferred to 2xTY broth (containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin) and the culture was grown aerobically at 37 8C. When the A600 nm was 0.6, overexpression was induced by

opposite face of the domains in (a) and (b). (e) and (f) Surface views looking down on the crowns of the bovine and E. coli F1-ATPases. The E. coli model was produced by mutation of the bovine crown. The circles show the positions of emergence of the a-helical N-terminal regions of a-subunits from the crowns.

labelled Celtone media (Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, USA). After induction, the cells were grown at 37 8C for three hours and harvested as described above. The 15N or 13C, 15N-labelled OSCP-NT was as described for the unlabelled protein, except that during the purification the pH was maintained at pH 5.0 and after the S-Sepharose column, the fractions containing OSCP-NT were concentrated and applied to a Sephadex G75 (16/60) column. Before analysis by NMR spectroscopy, bovine OSCP-NT was dialysed at 4 8C against four litres of buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.5 M sodium chloride and 0.001% PMSF. Complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) and protease inhibitor cocktail from plant cell extracts (Sigma) were added at each stage of the preparation. Then the protein was concentrated to approximately 0.5 mM. NMR samples were stored frozen. At room temperature, they became degraded over a period of two to three weeks. Analysis of proteins Proteins were transferred by electrophoresis from SDS-PAGE gels to membranes of polyvinylidene difluoride. Their N-terminal sequences were determined by Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer. Molecular masses of purified proteins were measured by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry in a PE Sciex APIIIC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Preparation of F1­OSCP and F1­OSCP-NT complexes Bovine F1-ATPase was purified from heart mitochondria as described40 with minor modifications: in buffers, ATP was replaced by ADP and 2-mercaptoethanol by dithiothreitol. The protease inhibitor amastatin (final concentration 10 mM) was added to the buffer. A fivefold molar excess of OSCP or OSCP-NT was added to F1-ATPase in buffer containing 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 M sodium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM magnesium sulphate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.002% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The solution was kept at 25 8C for 30 minutes, and then applied to a column of HiLoad Superdex 200 p.g. (XK 26/60) in the same buffer. Fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE41 in 12%­22% (v/v) acrylamide gels (acrylamide:N,N 0 -methylenebisacrylamide, 37.5:1, w/v), and proteins were stained with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 dye in 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid. NMR spectroscopy NMR spectra were recorded at 27 8C on Bruker Avance 800, DMX 600 and DRX 500 spectrometers equipped with 5 mm triple-resonance (1H/15N/13C) single-axis gradient probes, and a cryoprobe for the DRX 500. Data were processed using the program XWIN-NMR (Bruker GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and analysed using the program SPARKY. Homonuclear experiments included 2D 1H, 1H-NOESY, TOCSY and COSY experiments for samples in H2O and 2H2O (spectral widths of 8 kHz in both dimensions, using a WATERGATE scheme to suppress the water signal for the H2O samples and  Goddard, T.

addition of 150 mg solid isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside per litre of bacterial culture. Growth of the culture was continued overnight at 25 8C and the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000g, ten minutes, 4 8C). They were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer containing 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. The cells were broken by passing them twice through a French press. Over-expressed bovine OSCP and OSCP-NT both formed inclusion bodies. They were harvested by centrifugation (38,000g, 20 minutes, 4 8C), washed in 30 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and collected by centrifugation (38,000g, 20 minutes, 4 8C). Purification of bovine OSCP The OSCP inclusion bodies were solubilised in 50 ml of OSCP refolding buffer (6 M guanidine­HCl, 10 mM Mops­NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.5 M sodium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride). Any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (4000g, five minutes, 4 8C). OSCP buffer (10 mM Mops­NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.5 M sodium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) was added to a final volume of 200 ml, and the solution was dialysed for four hours against four litres of OSCP buffer, and for a further 18 hours against four litres of OSCP buffer containing 0.2 M sodium chloride. A precipitate was removed by centrifugation (26,000g, ten minutes, 4 8C). Refolded OSCP was applied to a S-Sepharose (XK 26/10) column equilibrated with OSCP buffer (containing 0.2 M sodium chloride). It eluted on a linear gradient of 0.2­1.0 M sodium chloride at 0.4 M. Fractions containing the OSCP were pooled, dialysed against OSCP buffer and applied onto a Q-Sepharose (XK 16/10) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The OSCP eluted in the flow-through fractions, free from contaminants. The purified protein was stored at 4 8C. Fragments containing the C-terminal domain of bovine OSCP (residues 93­190 and 121­190) were prepared similarly. Purification of bovine OSCP-NT OSCP-NT inclusion bodies were solubilised in OSCPNT refolding buffer (50 ml, consisting of 6 M guanidine­ HCl, 20 mM Mes­NaOH (pH 6.0), 0.5 M sodium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride). The solution was centrifuged (4000g, five minutes, 4 8C) to remove insoluble material. The volume of the supernatant was increased to 200 ml by addition of OSCP-NT buffer (20 mM Mes­NaOH (pH 6.0), 0.5 M sodium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.001% (w/v) phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride). This solution was dialysed for four hours against four litres of OSCP-NT buffer containing 0.2 M sodium chloride. A precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 26,000g, ten minutes, 4 8C. The OSCP-NT was purified first on a S-Sepharose (XK 26/10) column and then, as described for the intact OSCP, on a Mono S (HR 5/5) column. It eluted from both columns at 0.4 M sodium chloride. The molecular mass and the N-terminal sequence of recombinant OSCP-NT were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. For NMR analysis, isotopically labelled OSCP-NT was expressed in M9 media enriched with 25% 15N or 15N, 13C

presaturation of the residual water signal during recovery time for the 2H2O samples). Heteronuclear experiments included 2D 15N-HSQC, 2D 13C-HSQC, 3D HNCA, 3D CBCACONH, 3D 15N NOESY-HSQC, 3D 15N TOCSYHSQC, 3D 13C NOESY-HSQC and 3D HCCH-COSY. In all of the above experiments, spectral widths were generally 7­8 kHz for protons, 1.0­1.1 kHz for 15N, while for 13C dimensions they were 4 kHz (HNCA and CBCACONH) or 7­13 kHz (13C NOESY-HSQC and HCCH-COSY). Mixing times for NOESY-based experiments were 50­ 150 ms and 60­80 ms for TOCSY-based experiments. For the NMR titrations several sets of 2D 15N-HSQC and 2D 13C-HSQC experiments were recorded at different OSCP-NT/peptide molar ratios, keeping all the NMR parameters unaltered. The peptides a1-17, a9-17, a1-25, b1-15 and b3-27 were synthesised chemically (Jerini Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany). They were dissolved in the same buffer as the protein in order to keep the same conditions at each point of the titration and to avoid shifts due to pH variation. The quantity of protein was kept constant throughout each set of titration experiments and the peptides were added to the NMR tube and left to equilibrate for 30 minutes. Because of their low solubilities, large volumes of peptide (up to 500 ml) were added to the starting protein solution (550 ml). The increased volume and reduced protein concentration became significant at higher peptide excesses, and the effect of dilution of the protein was taken into account in the analysis of cross-peak intensities. The concentrations of protein and peptide solutions were determined by amino acid analysis. Chemical shift perturbations were calculated according to the formulae: DdðNHÞ Z f½DdH2 C ðDdN=5Þ2 =2g1=2 Structural calculations

OSCP N-terminal Domain

Cross-peaks were categorised by visual inspection from 2D NOESY spectra with mixing times 50 and 150 ms. Using strong sequential dNN(i, iC1) connectivities the upper bound of the category "strong" was defined as ° 2.8 A, while daN(i, iC3) connectivities defined the upper ° bound for the category "medium" (3.5 A). Remaining peaks were classified either as "weak" (upper bound of ° 5.0 A) or, for some lower intensity peaks, "very weak" ° (upper bound of 6.0 A). Lower bounds for all NOE ° restraints were set to 0.0 A. No multiplicity corrections for restraints involving genuinely equivalent spins were needed, since hrK6i summation was used during the structure calculation protocol. Structures were calculated from an extended polypeptide chain using a protocol supplied with the program CNS.43 Calculations employed 30,000 steps of dynamics at 50,000 K, 10,000 steps of cooling from 50,000 K to 0 K and 5000 steps of final minimization. In all structure calculations, the force field comprised only geometric terms (bond lengths and angles, van der Waals repulsive terms and restraints to maintain correct chirality for chiral centres, planarity for peptide bonds and aromatic rings); electrostatic, van der Waals attractive and generalised hydrogen bonding terms were not included. For the final ensemble a set of 50 structures was calculated and the converged structures selected corresponded to a plateau in the values of the overall calculated energy. The program CLUSTERPOSE44 was used to calculate average structures of ensembles of NMR structures and to determine the mean rmsd of these ensembles to the mean structure. Database accession numbers H, 15N and 13C NMR resonance assignments for at 27 8C and pH 6.5 have been deposited with the BioMagResBank, Madison, Wisconsin (accession code 6564). Atomic co-ordinates for the ensemble of 44 final structures of OSCP-NT have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession code 2bo5).

Surface plots highlight those residues where DdN or DdC, respectively, are greater than the corresponding value for the average of that property across the whole sequence, or greater than the average plus one standard deviation. All spectra were acquired in phase-sensitive mode and frequency discrimination in indirect dimensions was achieved using either TPPI, States-TPPI or echo­antiecho (for 15N or 13C dimensions with gradient selection). 1H, 13 C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced following the method described by Wishart et al.42 using sodium 3,3,3trimethylsilylpropionate (TSP) as internal 1H reference.

NMR assignment The 1H sequential assignment was achieved mainly using homonuclear 2D NOESY (tmZ50 ms and 150 ms) and TOCSY spectra in both H2O and 2H2O solutions, at 800 MHz and using different temperatures (295 K, 300 K and 305 K); this approach was adopted because labelled protein samples only became available later in the work. Once labelled protein was available, assignments were extended to include backbone 15N and 13C signals using 15 N NOESY-HSQC, 13C NOESY-HSQC, as well as triple resonance backbone experiments (HNCA, CBCA(CO) NH). Side-chain assignments for 13C signals were made using HCCH-COSY and 13C NOESY-HSQC, again in combination with 2D NOESY and TOCSY data.
