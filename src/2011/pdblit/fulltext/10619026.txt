AB ST R AC T Fibronectin (FN) fibrillogenesis is an essential biological process mediated by 51 integrin and cellular contractile forces. Assembly of a FN matrix by activated endothelial cells occurs during angiogenic blood vessel remodeling and signaling components that control this event represent attractive therapeutic targets. Here we examined the role of individual Rho GTPases in FN matrix remodeling by selectively attenuating their expression in cultured endothelial cells. Whereas pharmacological ablation of myosin-regulated contractility abrogated matrix assembly, no significant decrease was detected in the amount of FN deposited by RhoA, RhoB-, RhoC-, Rac1-, or Cdc42-depleted cells. Rather, distinct differences in fiber arrangement were observed. Most strikingly, RhoA silenced cells assembled a fine FN meshwork beneath 51 integrin-based fibrillar adhesions, in the absence of classical focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, indicating that 51 integrin translocation and FN fibril elongation can occur in low tension states such as those encountered by newly-forming vessels in tissue. In contrast, highly contractile Cdc42-deficient cells deposited FN globules and Rac-deficient cells assembled long arrays, reflecting their increased motility. We propose that regulation of FN scaffolds by Rho GTPase signaling impacts bidirectional communications and mechanical interactions between endothelial cells and their extracellular matrix during vascular morphogenesis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction
Both genetic and pharmacological studies have provided strong evidence pointing to a crucial role for fibronectin (FN) and its receptor 51 integrin in neovascularization [1­3]. Assembly of a provisional FN matrix by activated endothelial cells occurs during angiogenic blood vessel remodeling [4], thus signaling components that control this event are interesting targets for anti-

angiogenic therapies [5]. Beyond its role as an autocrine matrix component, recent evidence suggests that the FN matrix assembled by endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment may be crucial for endothelial-tumor cell interactions and for the recruitment of infiltrating immune cells and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells [6]. In vitro studies have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie remodeling of the extracellular FN

matrix, otherwise known as FN fibrillogenesis (reviewed in [7,8]. In cultured cells, this occurs at specific integrin-based adhesive structures, called fibrillar adhesions, rich in 51 integrin and tensin [9]. FN fibrillogenesis is regulated by extracellular factors, such as the physical properties of the pre-existing matrix [10] and the conformational state of 51 integrin [11], but also by cytoskeletal generated acto-myosin contractility (see [7]. Accordingly, the Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway has been shown to play a crucial role in FN matrix assembly in various cultured cells, including fibroblasts, osteoscarcoma cells and platelets [12­15]. We previously reported that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a cytoplasmic adaptor of 1 integrin plays a pivotal role in extracellular FN matrix assembly and capillary morphogenesis in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). ILK depletion in these cells abolished the formation of fibrillar, matrix-forming adhesions without affecting 51 integrin binding to FN, or FN expression [16]. Although the precise mechanism by which ILK controls fibrillogenesis remains to be deciphered, Rho family GTPases have been placed downstream of ILK-mediated integrin signaling cascades. ILK depletion markedly attenuates the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 [17­19]. RhoA activation following adhesion is only modestly affected in ILK-deficient cells [16], yet ILK has been reported to stimulate cytoskeletal contractility by promoting phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) at the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) sites in platelets [20], and by inducing inhibitory phosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase regulatory subunit, MYPT1 [21] (see scheme, Fig. 1). In vascular smooth muscle cells, ILK was proposed to be the kinase responsible for diphosphorylation of myosin [22]. In addition to the Rho/ROCK pathway, other Rho GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated in response to angiogenic agents and participate in cytoskeletal reorganization and capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells [23­27]. In light of the established link between the actin cytoskeleton and remodeling

of the FN matrix we set out to define the respective contribution of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 in this process in endothelial cells. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated influence of these GTPases on the topology of the fibrillar FN network and they document the presence of a low tension RhoA-independent mode of matrix-forming adhesion assembly and fibril growth.

Materials and methods
Materials
Tissue-culture plasticware was from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark) and Falcon (BD Biosciences San Diego, CA), for time lapse analysis. The inhibitors 1-[5-Iodonaphtalene-1-sulfonyl]-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine hydrochloride (ML-7) and (R)-(+)-trans4-(1-Aminoethyl)-N-(4-Pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride (Y-27632) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). ML-7 was reconstituted in a mixed solution of distilled water and 10% ethanol. Y-27632 was reconstituted in distilled water.

Cell culture
BAEC, kindly supplied by H. Drexler (Max-Planck-Institute, Bad Nauheim, Germany), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with low glucose (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Cergy Pointoise, France) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.

Antibodies
The anti-RhoA (clone 26C4) and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti-FN (clone 10), anti-paxillin and

Regulation of acto-myosin contractility by ILK may proceed through RhoA-dependent or -independent pathways that involve the phosphorylation of both myosin light chain (MLC) and the regulatory subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1). Loss of function studies can be carried out using pharmacological inhibitors (Y-27632, ML-7), bacterial toxins (C3) or siRNA; expression of constitutively active GTPases (CA GTPase) stimulates downstream effectors.

anti-Cdc42 antibodies were from BD Biosciences. The anti-5 integrin subunit polyclonal antibody (AB1928) was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (clone 23A8) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and rabbit polyclonal anti-ILK (DI) and anti-ERK (E1B4) were described previously [16]. Polyclonal anti phospho-MLC (pMLC) pS19 was from Biosource (Invitrogen) and anti--tubulin was from Zymed (Invitrogen). Anti-VE-cadherin was from Bender MedSystems (Tebu-bio SA, Le Perray en Yvelines). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase were from Promega France (Charbonnières-les-Bains, France) and New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. Fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies and phalloidin (Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen).

France). Image acquisition and morphometric analyses were performed using the MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp, Downington, PA).

FN analysis
Twenty-four hours after the second transfection with RNA duplexes, cells (3 × 105) were seeded in 6-well culture plates for FN determination in confluent monolayers. Two hours after plating, culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium and cells were lysed 24 h later in Laemmli buffer, for detection of FN by Western blotting. In the case of cells treated with ML7, incubations were performed in the presence of serum.

Capillary morphogenesis siRNA transfection
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed using criteria established by Tuschl et al. [28] were purchased from Eurogentec (Serang, Belgium), with the exception of one RhoA siRNA (ID # 2808), from Ambion (Spitfire, UK). Control and ILK siRNA sequences have been reported in [16], RhoA siRNA in [29], Rac1 siRNA sequences in [30] and Cdc42 siRNA sequence in [31]. The siRNA sequences 5-CAUCCAAGCCUACGACUACTT-3 and 5GAAUAAGAAGGACCUGAGGTT-3 were found to be most effective sequences for silencing RhoB and RhoC, respectively. Equal amounts of complementary RNA oligonucleotides were combined to a final concentration of 20 M and annealed according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA interference in BAEC was achieved by performing two transfections of double-stranded RNA as described [16]. Unless otherwise stated, cells were analyzed between 24 h and 48 h after the second transfection. The efficiency of RNA interference was determined by Western blot analysis or semi-quantitative RT-PCR in each experiment. Silencing ranged between 80 and 95%, with a penetrance of over 90%, as estimated by morphological alterations. Organization of cells into capillary-like networks structure was analyzed on a bed of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont-deClaix, France) (300 l Matrigel containing 10 ng/ml bFGF in a 35 mm diameter well). (Matrigel Lot Number 007014, 9.2 mg/ ml, without phenol red and with growth factors). The gel was first polymerized for 30 min at room temperature then placed at 37 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of 2 × 105 cells in complete Endothelial Growth Medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany).

Western blot analysis and Rho GTP binding protein pull-down assay
Western blots were performed on whole cell lysates, separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-based substrates from Pierce (Rockford, IL) and New England BioLabs, respectively. Immunoblots were quantified, where indicated, using the GeneGnome chemiluminescent imaging system (Syngene, Frederick, MD). RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 pull-down assays were performed as described [16].

Retroviral infection
Chimeras between enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and constitutively active Rho proteins cloned into the pBabepuro vector were provided by P. Roux (CRBM, Montpellier) [32] and pLXSN-GFP was from J.-C. Chambard (IDBC, Nice). Retroviral supernatants were generated by transient transfection of Phoenix cells with pLXSNGFP, pBabeGFPRacV12 or pBabeGFPCdc42V12 and used to infect BAEC. Infected cells were selected with 5 g/ml puromycin (for pBabe-based vectors) and 500 g/ml Geneticin (G418) (for pLXNGFP) and resistant populations were analyzed by Western blotting for expression of the transgene. Selected cell populations were used for experiments between 1 and 2 passages after transduction.

Northern blot analysis and semi-quantitative PCR
For Northern blot analysis of FN mRNA expression, total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Kit from Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France), separated on 1% agarose gels and transferred to hybridization membranes. As probe, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated fragment of a plasmid containing human FN type III repeats 6­10 (a gift from K. Yamada, NIH, Bethesda, MD) was radiolabeled using the rediprime II random prime kit (Amersham Bioscience). Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was performed using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Kit with 0.5 g RNA from siRNA-transfected cells, 24­48 h after the second transfection. The following primers were used: RhoA forward 5-AAGGACCAGTTCCCAGAGGT-3, RhoA reverse 5-CCAAAAGCACCAATCCTGTT-3 for 21 cycles, RhoB forward 5-CCCACCGTCTTCGAGAACTA-3, RhoB reverse 5-CGAGGTAGTCGTAGGCTTGG-3 for 24 cycles, RhoC forward 5-CCCGACAGTCTGGAAAACAT-3, RhoC reverse 5-CTTGGGGAGCTCAGAGAATG-3 for 24 cycles and 36B4 forward 5-GGCGACCTGGAAGTCCAACT-3, 36B4 reverse 5-CCATCAGCACCACAGCCTTC-3 for 24 cycles, as internal control.

Immunofluorescence labeling and microscopy
BAEC plated on glass coverslips were fixed in a solution of 3% paraformaldehyde containing 2% sucrose, stained and mounted in Gel/Mount (Biomedia, Foster City, CA). Cells were observed through 63×/1.4NA oil, 40×/1.3 or 10× 0.25NA air objectives on a Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M) equipped with a temperature- and CO2-controlled chamber and a CoolSnap HQ cooled charge-coupled-device camera (Roeper Scientifique, Every,

Results
The Rho/ROCK pathway and FN fibrillogenesis in BAEC
First we examined the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of Rhoassociated kinase (p160 ROCK, ROCK-1, ROCK-2, referred to as ROCK), MLCK, and acto-myosin contractility on FN fibrillogenesis in BAEC. As shown in Fig. 2A, BAEC accumulate an extensive network of extracellular FN fibrils during an overnight incubation on glass coverslips. Treatment of cells with the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, or the MLCK inhibitor, ML-7, resulted in a significant inhibition of FN matrix assembly. The dose dependency of this effect was quantified by Western analysis of cell-associated FN in lysates from treated cells (Fig. 2B). Comparable results were obtained with the myosin ATPase inhibitor, BDM (2,3-butanedione monoxime) (results not shown). Consistent with their reported effects on cultured cells, the inhibitors disrupted the actin cytoskeleton, causing the replacement of actin stress fibers with short F-actin plaques connected by thin microfilaments through-

out the cells (Fig. 2A). Decreased matrix assembly in Y-27632treated cells could not be attributed to a decrease in FN mRNA expression, as determined by Northern analysis shown in Fig. 2C.

Selective depletion of Rho proteins in BAEC
ILK silencing in BAEC has been found to affect the status of Rac1 and Cdc42, with only modest effects on the persistence of RhoA activation [16]. Whereas inhibition of the ROCK and cytoskeletal contractility clearly abrogates FN matrix, the precise contribution of RhoA to this process and possible implication of other Rho GTPases has not been well characterized. To do so, we selectively attenuated the expression of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 by RNA interference. As shown in the Western analysis of Fig. 3A, efficient inhibition of RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 expression was achieved by siRNA transfection. Between 2 and 3 mRNA targeting sequences with similar effects were used for each GTPase and results from the most effective and selective silencing duplexes are presented here. In BAEC, the decrease of Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA had no significant effect on the expression of the other GTPases, or the status of ILK

BAEC were transfected with siRNA duplexes that target Rac1 (50 nM), Cdc42 (50 nM), RhoA (20 nM), ILK (50 nM) or a control sequence (50 nM). Experiments were performed 24 h after the second transfection. (A) Levels of GTP-bound GTPases were analyzed by pull-down assays using GST-CRIB (PAK3) for Rac1 and Cdc42 and GST-RBD (Rhotekin) for RhoA. Efficiency of silencing was determined by Western blotting of the same lysates. Total ERK2 levels were monitored as a control for equal protein loading.

(Fig. 3A). Importantly, reductions in total GTPase levels resulted in concomitant decreases in their activity, as determined by monitoring active (GTP-bound) forms in appropriate pull-down assays in growing cells. Some functional crosstalk was observed in this assay as silencing of RhoA increased the levels of active Cdc42 and Rac1 silencing decreased the levels of active RhoA. With regard to the phenotypic consequences of Rho GTPase depletion in BAEC, silencing of RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 did not compromise survival or growth (not shown). As expected, striking changes in cell morphology and organization of the actin

cytoskeleton were observed following transfection of the targeted siRNA duplexes (see Figs. 3B, C and Videos 1­4 of spreading cells). RhoA depletion resulted in highly spread contact inhibited cells that assembled into confluent monolayers like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Morphometric analysis revealed that the spread surface area of RhoA siRNA-transfected cells was 1.6-fold greater than that of control siRNA-transfected cells (1597 +/- 89 versus 939 +/- 46 m2, respectively). In the majority of RhoA-depleted cells, stress fibers were replaced by a scattered array of F-actin nodes connected by thin microfilaments, and lamellipodial extensions were replaced

by a circumferential band of actin filaments. Cell motility was largely compromised as compared to control cells (Videos 1, 2 and data not shown). Rac1 siRNA transfection dramatically impaired cell spreading and peripheral lamellae formation whereas stress fiber formation remained largely intact. In marked contrast to RhoA-depleted cells, Rac1-depleted monolayers were refractory to density inhibition (data not shown and Fig. 8). Consistent with previously reported findings [33], reduced Rac1 activity was associated with a rapid, persistent cell migration (Video 3 and data not shown). Transfection of Cdc42 siRNA induced the most profound changes in cell shape and F-actin organization. Following transfection, cells became extremely irregular and highly contractile with an abundance of thick longitudinal stress fibers. Similar to Rac1deficient cells, Cdc42-depleted cells lost contact inhibition (data not shown and Fig. 8). In accordance with the established role of Cdc42 in cell polarity [34], Cdc42-deficient cells extended long dendritic processes in all directions and the F-actin-rich knobs at the ends of these extensions accumulated with time in culture after retraction of their stems (Video 4). Finally, we analyzed the effect of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 silencing on the ability of BAEC to form pseudo-capillary structures when plated on Matrigel beds (Fig. 3D). In this assay, cells elongate and coalesce to form honeycomb structures during an overnight incubation. We have previously shown that ILK depletion compromises cell­cell cohesion and capillary morphogenesis in this assay [16]. Transfection of siRNA targeting of RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 also interfered with this process, although selective depletion of the Rho GTPases yielded distinctly different phenotypes. Hence, RhoA-deficient cells formed short alignments of cells displaying a more spread appearance than their spindle-shaped control counterparts. Following Rac1 silencing, cells organized themselves into loosely knit webs with multiple branch points. Cdc42-deficient cells formed compact clusters of highly contractile cells linked by thin cellular extensions. The tractile forces generated in Cdc42-deficient cells led to marked constriction of the underlying Matrigel support.

Effects of Rho GTPase depletion on cell-associated FN levels and matrix assembly
We next examined the effect of Rho GTPase silencing on FN expression and assembly in BAEC. Silencing of ILK, known to reduce the levels of cell-associated FN by approximately 70% in these cells without decreasing FN mRNA expression [16], was performed for comparison. In contrast to ILK, no significant decrease in FN content was observed in lysates from cells transfected with siRNA duplexes under conditions that substantially reduced total and GTP-bound forms of RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 (Fig. 4A). Similar to ILK silencing [16], Rho GTPase depletion did not inhibit FN mRNA expression (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that FN production by BAEC is not regulated by RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 and they suggest that fibrillogenesis can proceed in their absence. However, they do not exclude the possibility that the cellassociated FN is present in a soluble, intracellular pool. Therefore, we assessed the ability of cells with reduced Rho GTPase expression to assemble their cell-associated FN into a fibrillar matrix. Intrigued by the apparent lack of effect of RhoA depletion on cell-associated FN levels, we first examined fibrillogenesis in

Fig. 4 ­ Effect of Rho protein silencing on FN fibrillogenesis. BAEC were transfected with control, 50 nM ILK, 20 nM RhoA, 50 nM Rac1, Cdc42 or control siRNA duplexes and plated for analysis 24 h after the second transfection. (A) Total cell-associated FN in transfected BAEC was determined by Western blotting of Laemmli lysates. ERK2 levels were analyzed as a protein loading control. Quantification corresponds to the percentage of cell-associated FN from ILK, RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 siRNA-transfected cells, relative to control siRNA-transfected cells (mean ± SEM, n = 3, p = 0.01). (B) Ten g of total RNA extracted from control siRNA-transfected or cells deficient in RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 was analyzed by Northern blotting to determine the levels of FN mRNA. RhoA-deficient cells. As FN matrix assembly is tightly regulated by culture conditions, the same protocol (i.e. time after plating, confluency) was used for Western analysis of total FN and immunostaining experiments. Figs. 5A and B depict the dose dependency of RhoA silencing and its impact on FN fibril formation, respectively. Despite robust attenuation of RhoA expression with 2 and 10 nM of the targeting siRNA, there was minimal effect on the level of cell-associated FN. Importantly, the assembled was efficiently incorporated into fibrillar networks on the subendothelial cell surface. Similar findings were obtained using a second more potent silencing sequence [29], as shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. Thus, surprisingly, fibrillogenesis proceeded in cells with reduced cytoskeletal tension, judged by the absence of actin stress fibers. To obtain insights into the role of RhoA in the dynamic organization of the FN network, and its link to the actin cytoskeleton, we co-stained FN and F-actin in RhoA-deficient

(A) Total cell-associated FN in BAEC transfected with the indicated concentration of control or RhoA targeting duplexes was determined by Western blotting of Laemmli lysates. The efficiency of RhoA silencing, as well as levels of phosphorylated MLC (pMLC) and tubulin was assessed in the same lysates. ERK2 was included as a protein loading control.

BAEC at various times after plating on uncoated glass coverslips. In spreading cells, actin filaments were arranged in parallel actin bundles resembling transversal arcs [35] that coalesced to form a thin cortical actin belt by 24 h (Fig. 5C). Fibrillogenesis did not occur beneath the parallel actin cables. Rather, matrix was assembled below the F-actin nodes and connecting microfibers, which likely represent sites of actin nucleation at points of cellsubstrate adhesion. As mentioned above, RhoA-deficient cells were relatively immobile, compared to the control, Rac1 or Cdc42

siRNA-transfected cells thus the matrix that they assembled was composed of thin, highly organized fibers. Interestingly, the level of phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) was not reduced following RhoA silencing (Fig. 5A). Rather, localization of the phosphorylated protein was redistributed from stress fibers (control cells, not shown) to the actin nodes and the cortical actin ring (Fig. 6) Next we examined the ability of RhoA-depleted cells to assemble fibrillar adhesions, specialized integrin-based structures

that bind soluble FN dimers and trigger their assembly into fibrils. These structures contain a distinct set of proteins, including the 51 FN receptor, and exclude other classical focal adhesion proteins rich in phosphotyrosine [36]. We have previously shown that ILK and paxillin localize in matrix-forming adhesions of BAEC [16]. Consistent with the ability of RhoA-depleted cells to assemble a FN matrix, we observed 51 integrin staining in elongated fibrillar adhesions that co-localized with paxillin, and fibrillar FN in siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6 and not shown). Not surprisingly, knockdown of RhoA totally precluded the formation of focal adhesions, Rho-dependent plaques that tether actin stress fibers to engaged integrins. In RhoA-depleted cells, phosphotyrosine staining was predominantly localized in peripheral focal complex-like structures and adherens junctions (Fig. 6 and Supplemental Fig. 2). Staining of 51 integrin and phosphotyrosine was mutually exclusive in these cells whereas paxillin was present in both 51 containing fibrillar adhesions and focal complexes. Hence, fibrillar adhesion formation in RhoA-deficient cells appears to occur in the absence of focal adhesions. In accordance with the role of focal adhesions in microtubule stability [37], excessive microtubule growth was also noted in the absence of focal adhesions (Supplemental Fig. 2).

RhoA expression has been found to upregulate RhoB [39]. Therefore we examined the effects of attenuating RhoB and RhoC expression on FN fibrillogenesis in BAEC. In the absence of functional antibodies, the efficiency and selectivity of silencing these highly similar Rho proteins was determined by performing semi-quantitative RT-PCR on RNA from siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 7A). Although distinct morphological differences were detected in sparsely seeded cells following RNA interference (not shown), we did not observe the severe inhibition of FN fibrillogenesis that was detected following pharmacologic ablation of ROCK in these cells (Fig. 7B). Rather, increased fibrillogenesis often accompanied RhoC knockdown (Fig. 7C).

Rac1 and Cdc42 regulation of FN fibrillogenesis
Whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 depletion had no quantitative effect on cell-associated FN (Fig. 4), phenotypic alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and motility of siRNA-transfected cells had a considerable impact on the pattern of assembled fibers (Fig. 8). In the case of Rac1-depleted cells, increased directional migration together with reduced contact inhibition resulted in the appearance of long fibrillar arrays along cell paths. Thus, fibers were not restricted to the subendothelial surface of the cells that assembled them. In contrast, FN was deposited in globules and thick fibers around highly contractile Cdc42-deficient cells. As a complementary approach, we performed gain of function analyses to determine how hyperactivation of these GTPase pathways would affect fibrillogenesis and capillary morphogenesis (Fig. 9). To do so, cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding GFP-fusions of constitutively active GTPase mutants. As expected, GFP-RacV12 induced extensive membrane ruffling,

Selective knock down of RhoB and RhoC
In view of the observed differences between the effects of ROCK inhibition with Y-27632 and RhoA silencing on FN fibrillogenesis in BAEC, we set out to determine whether other ROCK-activating systems affect this process. Indeed, RhoA is not the sole activator of ROCK and, in addition to RhoA, active forms of RhoB and RhoC have been shown to stimulate the kinase [38]. In addition, inhibition of

deregulated Rac1 or Cdc42 activity to undergo capillary morphogenesis in a Matrigel assay.

The subendothelial matrix plays both a structurally and functionally important role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and regulating the outgrowth of new vessels during tumor angiogenesis (reviewed in [4,40]). Although absent from the extracellular matrix of blood vessels in normal tissues, FN is a major constituent of the matrix that sheaths tumor-associated vessels [5]. Therefore, understanding the cellular signaling events that regulate FN production and assembly is of utmost importance for understanding neovascularization, and for devising strategies that promote its inhibition. The main objective of the present study was to examine signaling by Rho family GTPases and FN assembly using a selective loss of function RNA interference approach. Past studies of this process, largely focused on RhoA, have relied on the use of stimulatory agonists and pharmacological inhibitors [12­14]. Pharmacological ablation of Rho protein function has been achieved with Clostridium botulinum C3-transferase, with the limitations of cell entry problems and the lack of its ability to differentiate between highly similar isoforms such as RhoA, RhoB

promoted cell spreading and inhibited stress fiber formation. GFPCdc42V12, present in dorsal microvilli and peripheral actin-rich structures, exerted only subtle effects on cell shape (Supplemental Fig. 3). In contrast to Rac1- and Cdc42-deficient cells, confluent monolayers of GFP-RacV12- and GFP-Cdc42V12-expressing cells retained a similar degree of contact inhibition as monolayers of control GFP-expressing cells (data not shown). Analysis of FN fibrillogenesis was assessed by Western blotting and immunofluroscent staining (Figs. 9A and B) and the ability of cells to form pseudo-capillary networks was determined on Matrigel beds (Fig. 9C). Similar to the results obtained following knockdown of GTPase expression, the architecture of the fibrillar network was altered following manipulation of Rho GTPase activity, without affecting the quantity of FN present in cell lysates. No significant difference was detected in the ability of cells with

and RhoC [41]. Here, selective inhibition of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 expression, and activity, was achieved by RNA interference. We found that reduction in RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42 levels has only minimal effects on the quantity of FN assembled by endothelial cells. Rather, altered activity of these GTPases results in distinctive alterations in the structure of fibrils assembled by cells that reflect cytoskeletal alterations and cell shape changes. Most strikingly, reducing the levels of RhoA leads to the assembly of a finely weaved fibrillar meshwork beneath cells. This fishnet arrangement is not observed following silencing of RhoB or RhoC, despite the fact that RhoB and RhoC share displays >80% sequence identity with RhoA (see [42]), and activation of each has been reported to stimulate stress fiber formation in HeLa cells [38]. The finding that RhoA-targeted RNA interference does not abolish FN fibrillogenesis was unexpected in light of previously reported effects of Rho and ROCK inhibitors on FN assembly in

other systems [13,14] and the significant impairment of FN assembly in BAEC following inhibition of either ROCK, myosin light chain kinase or nonmuscle myosin II. Such differences may be accounted for by variance in the extent of inhibition, the protein targeted, the specificity of the inhibitors used or the state of cells upon inhibition (i.e. pharmacological inhibition of spread cells or chronic inhibition by siRNA of spreading cells). Silencing of RhoA was highly efficient in BAEC, as determined by Western blotting. It is noteworthy that RhoA depletion positively affects levels of active Cdc42, however expression of Cdc42V12 does not enhance FN assembly. With respect to the target, selective depletion of RhoA attenuates activation of all downstream effectors (e.g. ROCK, Dia1/Dia2 PKN citron kinase, PIP 5-kinase [43], yet MLC phosphorylation can proceed through alternative mechanisms, as discussed below. It is noteworthy that chronically decreasing expression of

2102

the RhoA protein, as opposed to acutely inhibiting its activity (or that of a downstream effector) in spread cells may differentially affect complex feedback regulatory loops in place to control the dynamics of integrin-based adhesion assembly and cytoskeletal organization.

Rho signaling and matrix assembly
FN fibrillogenesis is a multistep process largely dependent on 51 integrin and downstream signal transducers, including Src and PI3K, FAK, and ILK [16,44,45]. Importantly, all of these pathways modulate various Rho family proteins and affect cytoskeletal remodeling. Recent studies on the function of ILK pointed to a role for this integrin effector in regulating cell spreading and activation of Rac1 [17,18]. However, the present findings indicate that Rac1 depletion does not impair matrix assembly, and its constitutive activation does not enhance it. Accordingly, it was shown that PMA, an activator of Rac, does not increase the assembly of FN matrix in CHO cells [15]. Thus, in addition to Rac1 activation, ILK must exert Rac1-independent functions that are crucial for FN assembly. One such event may involve the reported effect of ILK on myosin phosphorylation [20,21] (schematized in Fig. 1). Indeed, we found that RhoA depletion did not reduce the total levels of phosphorylated MLC, rather, it altered the spatial distribution of the phosphorylated protein. Hence, RhoA silencing diminished phosphorylated MLC in the center of cells, consistent with previous studies showing that Rho/ROCK directly phorphorylates MLC at the cell center whereas MLCK appears to be the kinase responsible for phosphorylating MLC at the cell periphery. [46]. Irrespective of the kinase(s) involved, MLC phosphorylation appears to be crucial for FN assembly, as pharmacological inhibition of these two kinases displays a significant inhibitory effect. The regulation of MLC phosphorylation by ILK and other pathways in BAEC and the contribution of ROCK to these events remains to be explored. Nonetheless, for both matrix assembly and cytoskeletal organization in BAEC, ILK and RhoA do not appear to be on a linear signaling pathway as the observed phenotypes of RhoA-deficient (this study) and ILK-depleted cells [16] are markedly different. RhoA silencing is accompanied by rapid cell spreading, whereas ILK-depleted cells are spreading-deficient. Another striking difference is the ability of RhoA-depleted cells to form fibrillar adhesions, whereas this type of adhesion disappears following ILK silencing [16]. According to the current model of FN fibrillogenesis in fibroblasts (see [7]), 51 integrin engagement triggers the formation of small peripheral adhesions referred to as focal complexes. Then by an unknown mechanism involving recruitment of specific plaque proteins and actin filaments, the focal complexes undergo stepwise maturation into focal then fibrillar adhesions. These latter structures arise from focal adhesions by translocation of 51 integrin complexes along actin stress fibers [9]. In this way, soluble FN dimers bound to the 51 integrin are stretched and assembled into insoluble fibrils that generate the FN matrix. It is noteworthy that in addition to, and/or in cooperation with 51, other cell surface molecules such as v3 integrin and members of the syndecan family have been found to participate in FN fibrillogenesis (reviewed in [47]). Therefore, the examination of alternative pathways for matrix assembly with respect to Rho protein signaling remains to be considered.

In RhoA-deficient BAEC 5 integrin and phosphotyrosine accumulate in small peripheral adhesions whereas classical focal adhesions are undetectable, in keeping with the known requirement of RhoA for focal adhesion formation (see [48]. As mentioned above, in the absence of RhoA and focal adhesions, 5-rich fibrillar adhesions are able to assemble. Whereas the mechanism by which these fibrillar adhesions arise in chronically RhoA-deficient cells remains unclear, it has been shown in fibroblasts that once formed, they are less sensitive than focal adhesions to inhibition of acto-myosin [49]. Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that formation of these structures in BAEC depends upon the autocrine production of fibronectin (Cseh et al., in preparation). Indeed, RNA interference of Rho protein expression had no effect on FN expression by cells. Therefore, although cell generated tension is generally accepted to be a prerequisite for focal adhesion maturation and FN fibrillogenesis, our results demonstrate that matrix assembly in endothelial cells can arise in the absence of classical RhoA-dependent stress fibers and they indicate that an alternate RhoA-independent mechanism may operate. Indeed, Katz et al. have reported that fibrillar adhesions localize along thin actin filaments that appear structurally distinct from the thicker Rho-dependent actin stress fibers [10].

FN and capillary morphogenesis
Finally, our results confirm previous findings that Rho family GTPase signaling is involved in tube formation in 3D matrices in vitro, and angiogenesis in vivo. C3 transferase, dominant-negative Rho (RhoN19) and the ROCK inhibitor have all been shown to impede the formation of capillary-like structures by endothelial cells in vitro, and angiogenesis in vivo [24,50­52]. More recently, inhibition of ERK signaling in endothelial cells was reported to inhibit angiogenesis by increasing ROCK activity and contractility [53]. Altogether, these findings support the emerging consensus that cell generated tension plays an important role in endothelial cell organization and vascular development [27]. Thus far, little attention has been paid to the impact of Rho-mediated signaling on the architecture of the subendothelial FN matrix. Our findings confirm the requirement for nonmuscle myosin II in fibrillogenesis yet they also reveal that endothelial cells can assemble an elaborate FN matrix in a low tension state (i.e. inactive RhoA) under conditions that are more likely to be encountered in vivo than under high tension conditions of cultured cells (i.e. in contact with a rigid surfaces in the presence of serum activators of Rho). Further studies are warranted to define the subendothelial FN matrix configuration in vivo, to elucidate its regulation by angiogenic factors that modulate Rho activity, and to determine its contribution to the mechanical control of neovascularization.
