Abstract Protein kinase CK2 (former name: ``casein kinase 2'') is a pivotal and ubiquitously expressed member of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily. It predominantly exists as a heterotetrameric holoenzyme composed of two catalytic subunits (CK2a) and two regulatory subunits (CK2b). In higher animals two paralog catalytic chains--abbreviated CK2a and CK2a 0 --exist which can combine with CK2b to three isoforms of the holoenzyme: CK2a2b2, CK2a02 b2 , and CK2aa0 b2 . While CK2a and the ``normal'' holoenzyme CK2a2b2 have been extensively characterized in vitro and in vivo, little is known about the enzymological properties of CK2a 0 and the ``alternative'' holoenzyme CK2a02 b2 and about their specific physiological roles. A major reason for this lack of knowledge is the fact that so far CK2a 0 rather than CK2a has caused serious stability and solubility problems during standard heterologous expression procedures. To overcome them, we developed a preparation scheme for CK2a02 b2 from Homo sapiens in catalytically active form based on two critical steps: first expression of human CK2a 0 as a well soluble fusion protein with the maltose binding protein (MBP) and second proteolytic cleavage of CK2a 0 ≠MBP in the presence of human CK2b so that CK2a 0 subunits are incorporated into holoenzyme complexes directly after their release from MBP. This successful strategy which may be adopted in comparably difficult cases of protein/protein complex preparation is presented here together with evidence that the CK2a 0 -based and the CK2a-based holoenzymes are similar concerning their catalytic activities but are significantly different with respect to some well-known CK2 properties like autophosphorylation and supra-molecular aggregation. ” 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Protein kinase CK2,1 a member of the protein kinase CMGC subfamily, consists of two catalytic a-subunits and two regulatory b-subunits. In addition to the catalytic a-subunit, an isozyme termed a 0 has been found in man. A detailed description of the properties of the expressed CK2 subunits is given in Issinger [1].

The presence of a second CK2a-subunit in some tissues and organs was originally considered as the result of proteolytic cleavage [2≠4] and the existence of a ``true'' isozyme was discussed controversially, especially since the molecular mass of the proteolytic cleavage product of the CK2a-subunit and that from the isozyme are very similar. However, CK2 from calf thymus and bovine testis were shown to harbor two catalytic subunits that were distinct polypeptides [5,6]. CK2a and CK2a 0 are paralog proteins. Typically the evolution of paralog proteins is combined with a functional specialization since otherwise one of the paralogs would be lost. Hence it makes sense to look for functional differences between CK2a and CK2a 0 .

Sequence comparisons between CK2a and CK2a 0 show that the main difference is in the C-terminal region which is not a part of the conserved catalytic core of protein kinases, furthermore CK2a and a 0 are highly conserved in vertebrates [5] and coexpressed making it clear that a functional differentiation between CK2a and CK2a 0 must have a molecular and structural basis, however so far nearly nothing is known about such differences--partly because of problems with preparation of CK2a 0 . The CK2a-subunit is found ubiquitously in all cells and organs whereas the CK2a 0 subunit is preferentially found in brain and testis [7]. A knock-out of the CK2a 0 -subunit in mice led to a condition similar to globozoospermia in the male mice where the shaping of the nuclear head of the spermatozoa is disturbed leading to ``round-headed'' infertile spermatozoas [8]. Hence, CK2a cannot compensate the loss of CK2a 0 completely, consistent with a and a 0 -subunits carrying out specialized functions. Since CK2a 0 is found predominantly in testis, beside small amounts of CK2a, it is however difficult to assess whether it is the loss of CK2 activity that is responsible for this phenotype in the male mice or whether it is the a 0 -subunit itself. CK2 is thought to be constitutively active, however Valero et al. [9] had shown that high molecular mass aggregates of CK2 are devoid of activity in contrast to ring-like structures and protomers, and that polybasic compounds such as spermine and polylysine can diminish aggregate formation. Interestingly, a physiological correlation between spermine levels and CK2 activity has been shown, since overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in transgenic mice was concomitant accompanied by an increase in CK2 levels and activity [10]. These results suggest that polyamines can regulate the CK2 enzyme by affecting cellular distribution as well as enzyme activity and levels. We show that spermine leads to a reduction of hsCK2a2b2 aggregates in vitro. Hence, physiological high ODC levels and activity, which have been shown in tumors [11≠15] and highly proliferating cells, could be responsible for the high CK2 levels and activity reported in all so far investigated tumors [4,16,17]. We were able to overcome the hitherto existing problems associated with the expression of CK2a 0 and show here for the first time in which respect the ``normal'' (CK2a-based) and the ``alternative'' (CK2a 0 -based) holoenzymes are similar and--more interesting--in which respect they differ from each other. Our comparative analysis of the two holoenzymes (hsCK2a2b2 and hsCK2a02 b2 ) showed only minor differences with respect to the kinetic parameters. This does not come as a surprise, since the catalytic center of both isozymes is virtually identical [18]. Strikingly the differences we detected refer to the aggregation behavior, which is discussed as a candidate for a CK2 regulation mechanism. Moreover, aggregation behavior is directly correlated with the autophosphorylation status, i.e., lack of aggregation abrogates autophosphorylation and vice versa and the lack of oligomer

formation of the CK2a 0 -containing holoenzyme could be of physiological relevance, especially with respect to its predominantly sole presence in certain organs and tissues. Materials and methods Reagents and antibodies The pMAL fusion protein and purification system was from New England Biolabs and used for the expression and purification of MBP-tagged CK2a 0 . The monoclonal antibodies against CK2a and CK2b were purchased from EMD/Calbiochem, the polyclonal antibody against CK2a 0 was raised by immunization of rabbits with a CK2a 0 peptide (333SQPCADNAVLSSGLTAAR350). [c-32P]ATP and [c-32P]GTP, both with a specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol, were from Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig. The synthetic peptide substrate RRRDDDSDDD was from KinaseDetect. Polylysine (30≠70 kDa), spermine, and dephosphorylated casein used for phosphorylation assays were all from Sigma. N-MBP≠CK2a 0 expression and purification The coding region of human CK2a 0 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5 0 -CGCGGATCCATGCCCGGCCCGGCCGC (upstream primer) and 5 0 -CCCAAGCTTTCATCGTGCTGCCGTG AGACCA (downstream primer) and cloned into the vector pMAL-c2X using the restriction sites BamHI and HindIII and the bacterial strain TB1. The sequence of the obtained bacterial clone was confirmed, it contained one mutation resulting in an amino acid exchange of D39 of CK2a 0 to G39. Expression of the resulting recombinant N-terminalMBP≠CK2a 0 fusion protein was done by growing the clone in rich medium until A600 of 0.5 was reached and induction with 0.3 mM IPTG for 2 h at 37 ∞C. The cell pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mM Tris≠HCl pH 7.4, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 10 ml/g pellet) and sonicated. The soluble supernatant of the pellet from 2 liter of bacterial culture was loaded onto an amylose column (10 ml bed volume). The MBP-tagged CK2a 0 was eluted by a 0≠10 mM maltose gradient in extraction buffer. Fractions containing N-MBP≠CK2a 0 were pooled and dialyzed against extraction buffer. Reconstitution of CK2a02 b2 and cleavage of the MBP tag N-MBP≠CK2a 0 was mixed with purified hsCK2b (expression and purification of CK2b was performed as described [19]) in a molar ratio of 1:1 for 10 min on ice and diluted with extraction buffer so that the reaction contained 1 mg ml¿1 of the fusion protein. Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) was added to the reaction (1 mg/ 100 mg fusion protein) and left for 3 h at room temperature. The sample was loaded onto a Superdex 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated in 25 mM

Tris≠HCl, 300 mM NaCl pH 8.5. Fractions with only cleaved CK2a 0 in complex with CK2b were identified by SDS≠PAGE and used for further analysis. hsCK2a2b2 1≠335 and hsCK2a2 b2 were purified as described earlier [20]. Phosphorylation assays The kinetic assay for CK2 was carried out in principle as described previously [21] with each measurement performed in triplicate. The reaction mixtures had a total volume of 40 ll and contained 20 ng of enzyme, which corresponds to 3.86 nM hsCK2a2b2 (sequence-derived molecular mass 129,625 g/mol) and 3.78 nM hsCK2a02 b2 (133,643 g/mol). The kinase buffer contained 25 mM Tris≠HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM dithiothreitol. For the experiments with ATP and GTP as co-substrates, the concentration of these were varied between 2 and 200 lM [c-32P]ATP or [c-32P]GTP, while the substrate concentration was kept constant at 500 lM synthetic peptide (RRRDDDSDDD). For the kinetic analysis with the peptide substrate 10≠500 lM synthetic peptide was used and the concentration of co-substrate was kept constant at 125 lM [c-32P]ATP. Casein was varied between 0.025 and 0.6 mg ml¿1 casein and [c-32P]ATP or [c-32P]GTP kept constant at 500 lM. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 ∞C, and 20 ll were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and washed with phosphoric acid. When casein was used as a substrate the samples were spotted on 3 MM paper (Whatmann) and washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid. A liquid scintillation counter (Canberra≠Packard) was used for measuring incorporation of 32P. The kinetic parameters were calculated using the program ENZPACK (Biosoft, Cambridge, England). KM and Vmax values were taken as averages based on Hanes Fit, Eadie≠Hofstee plots, and the direct linear method. For the autophosphorylation experiment; hsCK2a2b2, 1≠335 hsCK2a2 b2 and hsCK2a02 b2 were incubated at 30 ∞C for 30 min in a total volume of 20 ll containing kinase buffer and 50 lM [c-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-sample buffer and the proteins were separated by SDS≠PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie blue and used for autoradiography. The bands were excised from the gel and used for liquid scintillation counting. Western blotting Proteins were separated by SDS≠PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Biorad). The membrane was blocked with 0.2% casein/PBS and incubated with monoclonal CK2a and CK2b antibodies or a polyclonal antibody against CK2a 0 . The secondary antibodies were conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) and detection was done with the CDP-star system from Tropix.

Gel filtration analysis hsCK2a1≠335 b2 , hsCK2a2b2, and hrCK2a02 b2 were loaded 2 onto a Superose 6 column mounted on a SMART chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated in either 25 mM Tris≠HCl pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl or 25 mM Tris≠HCl pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl. hsCK2a2b2 was incubated with 5 mM spermine for 2 h on ice in 25 mM Tris≠HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and loaded onto the Superose 6 column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris≠HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Results Expression and purification of hsCK2a02 b2 Previous expression attempts in our laboratory with CK2a 0 -His-tag led to satisfactory expression levels but the obtained product was insoluble. Only the much larger MBP-tag allowed us to obtain a soluble enzyme, so hsCK2a 0 was expressed as an MBP-tagged fusion protein and purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (Fig. 1A). An attempt to cleave the MBP-tag by treatment of the fusion protein with Factor Xa, led to a gradual precipitation of the CK2a 0 -subunit over several hours, confirming our initial observations that this recombinant CK2-subunit is characterized by an unusual insolubility. To overcome the difficulties encountered under cleavage of the MBP-tagged CK2a 0 , we have performed the proteolytic cleavage of the MBP tag in the presence of recombinant hsCK2b assuming that the spontaneous formation of a tetrameric CK2 holoenzyme would overcome the solubility problem. This was indeed the case as shown by subsequent gel filtration analysis. Fig. 1B shows the elution pattern of the mixture consisting of N-MBP≠CK2a 0 , Factor Xa, and CK2b. Three major peaks were obtained. The proteins in the peak fractions were identified by SDS PAGE analysis. The gel shows (from left to right) the material before Factor Xa addition, after cleavage with Factor Xa followed by fractions no. 12 through 20. In fraction no. 14, which corresponds to a molecular mass of app. 158 kDa, the holoenzyme eluted as indicated by the presence of the CK2a 0 and CK2bsubunits. In fraction no. 16 different forms of CK2b (eluting as a dimer, i.e., app. 52 kDa, and partially degraded) were identified and finally the MBP protein (40 kDa) eluted in fraction no. 17. The material found in fraction no. 14 was used for further investigations (Fig. 1C). Kinetic analysis of hsCK2a2b2 and hsCK2a02 b2 To further characterize the hsCK2a02 b2 holoenzyme we have conducted experiments using ATP and GTP as cosubstrates. Moreover, kinetic analyses were performed using either the synthetic peptide or casein as substrate. Although the synthetic peptide, harboring the typical

CK2 consensus sequence, is an accepted in vitro substrate, the use of a protein is compelling when exploring possible in vivo differences between two closely related proteins. The KM values for hsCK2a2b2 and hsCK2a02 b2 for ATP were 23.6 and 18.2 lM, respectively--using the synthetic peptide as substrate (Table 1). A similar ratio was found for kcat/KM, i.e., 0.13 and 0.14 s¿1 lM¿1. When GTP served as a co-substrate the KM values for hsCK2a2b2 and hsCK2a02 b2 for GTP were 65.7 and 87.5 lM, respectively. The kcat/KM ratios were almost identical for both enzymes 0.021 and 0.019 s¿1 lM¿1, respectively. A comparison of the kcat/KM values for ATP/GTP yielded very similar values too, 6.2 and 7.4 s¿1 lM¿1, respectively (Table 1). Determination of the KM value for the synthetic peptide using ATP as a co-substrate also showed similar results, i.e., 45.4 and 39.9 lM. The kcat/KM ratio was 0.063 and 0.044 s¿1 lM¿1, respectively. So here too no significant difference was found between the two enzymes. Using casein as a substrate and ATP as a co-substrate the KM values were 0.43 mg ml¿1 for hsCK2a2b2 and 0.8 mg ml¿1 for hsCK2a02 b2 . Here, we have a clear difference between the two CK2 holoenzymes suggesting that the hsCK2a2b2 has twice as high affinity for the protein substrate than hsCK2a02 b2 . Such a difference was not seen for the peptide substrate. With GTP as a co-substrate the corresponding values were 0.3 and 0.24 mg ml¿1, respectively (Table 1). There was however a striking difference between the two holoenzymes with respect to stability at 45 ∞C. After 2 min virtually no loss of enzyme activity was observed in the case of hsCK2a2b2, whereas in the case of the a 0 -subunit containing holoenzyme an activity loss of app. 50% occurred. After 14 min of incubation only app. 10% activity remained, whereas in the case of the a-subunit holoenzyme still app. 80% of the original activity was present (data not shown). Characterization of CK2 holoenzymes as visualized by Coomassie blue staining and Western blot detection Owing to the already mentioned confusion concerning CK2a degradation products and the CK2a 0 gene product we show three different CK2 holoenzyme preparations, differing in their CK2a-subunit (Fig. 2A). The first lane shows recombinant hsCK2a2b2 (app. 50% degradation of the asubunit has occurred), the second and third lane show hsCK2a1≠335 b2 and hsCK2a02 b2 , respectively. The use of 2 specific antibodies allows us to distinguish between CK2a and its degradation product or the CK2a 0 isozyme. Whereas the monoclonal CK2a-antibody detects the CK2a- and the CK2a 0 -subunits, since it is directed against a sequence, i.e., 319MEHPYF324, present in both CK2asubunits [22], a polyclonal antibody directed against the CK2a 0 -subunit does not cross-react with CK2a and its degradation product. The CK2a 0 isoform shows 85.9% sequence identity to CK2a, despite the fact that it is lacking

phorylation was detected in contrast to the hsCK2a2b2 holoenzyme (Fig. 4). Another typical feature of the hsCK2a2b2 holoenzyme is the phosphorylation of the CK2a-subunit in the presence of polybasic compounds such as polylysine [24]. Also this hallmark of the hsCK2a2b2 holoenzyme was absent in the hsCK2a 0 2b2 holoenzyme. We have also tested the holoenzyme contain1≠335 ing the shortened CK2a-subunit--hsCK2a2 b2 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, this holoenzyme shows autophosphorylation of the CK2b-subunit comparable to the hsCK2a2b2 holoenzyme, however, upon addition of polylysine no phosphorylation of the CK2a-subunit is observed. Gel filtration analyses of hsCK2a2b2, hsCK2a1≠335 b2 , 2 and hsCK2a 0 2b2 Fig. 5 shows a gel filtration analysis of the three different CK2 holoenzymes in the presence of 0.15 and 0.1 M NaCl, respectively. The hsCK2a2b2 holoenzyme shows the typical distribution at low salt (0.15 M), i.e., a protomer peak and a high molecular mass peak. In the case of the hsCK2a02 b2 holoenzyme only protomers are found and in the case of the artificially shortened CK2a-subunit containing holoenzyme a shift of the protomer to larger aggregates is observed showing an intermediate profile. At 0.1 M NaCl the shift from the protomer to the higher molecular mass forms seen at 0.15 M for the hsCK2a2b2 holoenzyme becomes even more prominent, whereas in the case of the hsCK2a02 b2 holoenzyme still only the protomers are present with absolutely no sign of aggregation. Influence of spermine on the aggregation behavior of CK2a2b2 Polybasic compounds such as spermine and polylysine can inhibit the autophosphorylation of CK2b and if intermolecular CK2b phosphorylation is indicative of aggregate formation, then the presence of polybasic compounds

The only significant difference between the two catalytic subunits is found in the last 14 amino acid residues found in CK2a 0 (Fig. 3). Autophosphorylation of CK2b One of the hallmarks of hsCK2a2b2 is the capability to undergo autophosphorylation of the Ser2 and Ser3 residues in the CK2b moiety of the holoenzyme [23]. We were wondering whether this typical feature would also be found for the hsCK2a 0 2b2 holoenzyme. Strikingly no such autophos-

The maize enzyme was included because it is the best characterized CK2a subunit on a structural level [43]. The alignment was calculated with PILEUP from the sequence analysis package GCG [44]. Positions identical in all three chains are printed with bold capital letters. The alignment demonstrates that the C-terminal segment is the region of strongest variability among the isoforms of human CK2a.

should diminish aggregate formation. We have analyzed the influence of spermine on the aggregation behavior of hsCK2a2b2. The theoretical isoelectric point of CK2 holoenzyme is 6.72 (calculated with PEPSTATS from the EMBOSS suite [25]). We have lowered the pH for the gel filtration analysis from pH 8.5 (Fig. 5) to pH 7.5. We anticipated that shifting the pH closer to the isoelectric point should cause the tetrameric holoenzyme (Fig. 5, fraction no. 15) to shift to the high molecular mass form and thus allow us to see, a possible, more pronounced influence of spermine. As can be seen in Fig. 6 the majority of the tetrameric CK2 holoenzyme has indeed shifted to high molecular mass aggregates, now eluting in fractions 10 and 11. Subsequently, the CK2 holoenzyme was analyzed in the presence of equimolar amounts of spermine (Fig. 6) resulting in a shift of the polymeric CK2 to the protomeric tetramers.

Discussion Similarities and differences between the two paralogs CK2a and CK2a 0 The major difference between the two a-isoforms, i.e., the lack of the C-terminal 41 amino acids in CK2a 0 should be the key to look for functional differences between the two enzymes. Four phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region of CK2a are phosphorylated in mitotic cells. CK2a 0 lacks these sites and is consequently not phosphorylated [26]. Interestingly, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1, is able to interact with CK2a, but not with CK2a 0 , and only when CK2a is phosphorylated at the above-mentioned four residues [27]. Partial alignment of 23 CK2a sequences in the catalytic loop region [18] shows that the consensus sequence found

Fig. 4. Autophosphorylation of the different CK2 holoenzymes. hsCK2a2b2, hsCK2a1≠335 b2 , and hsCK2a02 b2 were incubated with 2 [c-32P]ATP. Where indicated poly-L-lysine was added to a final concentration of 2 lM. The reactions were analyzed by SDS≠PAGE and autoradiography. Protein bands were excised from the gel and counted in the scintillation counter and below the autoradiogram, the relative incorporation of [c-32P]ATP is shown. For each holoenzyme the phosphorylation of the individual subunits was set to 100 in the absence of poly-L-lysine.

holoenzyme complex was ruled out with the elucidation ∞ of the holoenzyme structure [31] because of a 30 A distance from the catalytic center to the target Ser2/3 residues in the CK2b-subunit. Pagano et al. [36] proposed that autophosphorylation of CK2b takes place through an ``intraoligomeric'' mechanism, where the b-subunits of the protomer are phosphorylated by the catalytic subunits of an adjacent protomer. In the case of the truncated CK2a-containing holoenzyme a strong autophosphorylation of the b-subunit was observed, yet no phosphorylation of CK2a. Addition of a polybasic compound, here polylysine, did not show the expected shift to CK2a phosphorylation, supporting the notion that the autophosphorylation site in CK2a must reside in the C-terminal sequence which is not present neither in the shortened CK2a version nor in CK2a 0 (Fig. 3). In the case of the hsCK2a02 b2 the result was even more drastic since no CK2b phosphorylation occured. This is in contrast to results obtained by Bodenbach et al. [37] who detected autophosphorylation of CK2b. Based on our own results concerning the expression of CK2a 0 we must strongly assume that only a few soluble molecules were obtained by these authors. Implications for regulation: constitutively active CK2a02 b2 vs. regulatable CK2a2b2 We observed remarkable differences in the elution pattern of the three CK2 holoenzymes. Most remarkable was the behavior of the hsCK2a02 b2 holoenzyme, which even at low salt conditions did not show any tendency to form aggregates, indeed it behaved as the monomeric CK2a-subunit [30].Hence, we conclude that the tendency to form aggregates is present in both hsCK2a2b2 and the hsCK2a1≠335 b2 but totally absent in hsCK2a02 b2 . 2 Several authors [9,38,39] have hypothesized that aggregation of hsCK2a2b2 could be a means to regulate CK2 activity, whereby the protomer would be the active form and the oligomers would be inactive. Niefind and Issinger [40] demonstrated that in the CK2 holoenzyme, crystal contacts between different CK2 tetramers exist which provide structural details of the secondary CK2a/CK2b interactions. These mainly ionic interactions lead to trimeric rings of CK2 holoenzymes in the crystal. Although one would predict the trimeric complexes to exhibit CK2 activity and that the trimeric complexes could be the starting point for filament formation, the larger filaments would be inactive (as shown by Valero et al. [9]). Our data support the notion to predict whether a CK2 holoenzyme can form high molecular mass complexes or not, i.e., lack of autophosphorylation is indicative for lack of forming aggregates and vice versa. As a logic consequence we have extended this postulate also with respect to the influence of polybasic compounds, such as polylysine and spermine, with respect to the autophosphorylation results obtained. If the presence of polybasic compounds leads to a reduction of intermolecular CK2b phosphorylation then aggre-

between amino acid residues 150≠170 is virtually identical from yeast to man, including the CK2a-isoforms thus precluding to expect drastic differences in enzyme activity between the different CK2a species and isoforms. In line with this statement is our comparison of the kinetic parameters between the recombinant hsCK2a02 b2 and hsCK2a2b2 which revealed only minor differences, in agreement with the kinetic results obtained by Antonelli et al. [28]. Our results, concerning the high sensitivity of CK2a 0 towards heat treatment, are in agreement with experiments by Guerra et al. [29] and Rasmussen et al. [18] who have shown that CK2 holoenzymes containing shorter versions of CK2a are more rapidly inactivated by heat treatment than the full length CK2a-containing holoenzyme. Association of full length CK2a with CK2b leads to an increase and/or stabilization of the a-helical character of one or both of the subunits, which may give a degree of thermal stability to the a-subunit [30]. Hence, the reason for the observed sensitivity towards heat treatment in the CK2 holoenzymes containing a shorter version of CK2a could be a less tight interaction between the CK2a and the CK2b. Such a loose interaction, with an even lesser common surface area between the two subunits, could also make it more likely, that such a complex could dissociate into its subunits, even with a higher probability, than already postulated, based on structural evidence, for the full length CK2a-containing holoenzyme [31]. It is almost a hallmark of CK2 to undergo autophosphorylation of the CK2b-subunit [23,24,32≠35]. Upon addition of polylysine or spermine this autophosphorylation is diminished leading to phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit. An intramolecular phosphorylation catalyzed by the catalytic subunit within the tetrameric

gate formation should be diminished. Spermine disturbs the electrostatic interaction between the acidic loop in the CK2b subunit and the basic region around the active center of CK2a, however, not within the holoenzyme but between different holoenzyme molecules [9]. Since high molecular aggregates have been shown to be devoid of enzyme activity [9] our results demonstrate a

potential physiological mode of inactivation/activation of protein kinase CK2. Since the hsCK2a02 b2 cannot form aggregates, we have to assume that only CK2a2b2 is able to be regulated by aggregation/disaggregation, whereas the hsCK2a02 b2 holoenzyme always exists as an active tetramer, not undergoing high molecular mass aggregation. Yet, as already indicated

Fig. 7. Structural imposition of PKA and CK2a1≠335. Structural superimposition of PKA (red a-helices, green b-strands, grey loops) and CK2a1≠335 (magenta). The backbone course of the final 30 residues of PKA are highlighted in blue. The location of the active site is indicated by ATP (black) as bound to PKA. The PKA coordinates were taken from Protein Data Bank [45] file 1ATP [42], the CK2a1≠335 coordinates from the CK2 holoenzyme structure (subunit A of Protein Data Bank file 1JWH [31]). The figure was created with BRAGI [46]. It demonstrates that in PKA the C-terminal segments are attached in such a way to the two main domains of the molecule that it adopts a well defined 3D-structure. This situation may be exemplary for hsCK2a 0 while in contrast in hsCK2a the long degradable C-terminal tail is obviously not stabilized by the rest of the molecule.

earlier, the hypothesized loose interaction with the CK2bsubunit could make the hsCK2a02 b2 more prone to dissociation into its individual subunits by yet to be discovered mechanisms and thus contribute substantially to additional functions of the CK2 subunits, e.g., by interacting with other proteins, as has been shown by several authors (for review Olsen et al. [41]). Structural reasons for the unability of a CK2a 0 based holoenzyme to aggregate We can only speculate what may prevent the alternative holoenzyme hsCK2a02 b2 from aggregation in a similar way as the ``normal'' holoenzyme hsCK2a2b2. Yet, it is established that the ability of hsCK2a2b2 tetramers to form higher ordered aggregates critically depends on electrostatic interactions between the acidic loop of hsCK2b and the basic stretch of a hsCK2a subunit in a different tetramer [40]. hsCK2a02 b2 contains these regions, too, so that the missing aggregation propensity of this holoenzyme is somewhat mysterious. Possibly the C-terminal tail of hsCK2a 0 , which is--on the level of the primary struc-

24.97

tures--the main distinctive feature compared to hsCK2a, plays a major role in this context. Interestingly, the C-terminal segment of CK2a 0 does not tend to be degraded in contrast to that of CK2a. It is conceivable that this C-terminal tail is nestled to the major part of the molecule in a similar way as it is known from protein kinase A (PKA). PKA contains a C-terminal segment which has exactly the same length as that of hsCK2a 0 and which is folded back to the N-terminal domain of the catalytic core of the kinase [42] (Fig. 7). If the C-terminal tail of hsCK2a 0 is structured in such a way it might interfere with the above-mentioned electrostatic interactions between different tetramers and hence prevent a supramolecular organization. Whether these ideas are realistic will be seen in the future from a structure determination of the hsCK2a02 b2 holoenzyme. Acknowledgments We thank Diane BaunbÊk and Hans H.
