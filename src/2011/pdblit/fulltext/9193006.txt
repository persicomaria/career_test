Clostridium perfringens biotype A strains are the causative agents of gasgangrene in man and are also implicated as etiological agents in sudden death syndrome in young domestic livestock. The main virulence factor produced by these strains is a zinc-dependent, phosphatidylcholinepreferring phospholipase C (alpha-toxin). The crystal structure of alphatoxin, at pH 7.5, with the active site open and therefore accessible to substrate has previously been reported, as has calcium-binding to the C-terminal domain of the enzyme at pH 4.7. Here we focus on conformation changes in the N-terminal domain of alpha-toxin in crystals grown at acidic pH. These changes result in both the obscuring of the toxin active site and the loss of one of three zinc ions from it. Additionally, this "closed" form contains a small alpha helix, not present in the open structure, which hydrogen bonds to both the N and C-terminal domains. In conjunction with the previously reported findings that alpha-toxin can exist in active and inactive forms and that Thr74Ile and Phe69Cys substitutions markedly reduced the haemolytic activity of the enzyme, our work suggests that these loop conformations play a critical role in the activity of the toxin.

Introduction Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium normally found in the intestines of mammals, in soil, and in water. Type A strains of the bacterium are the most frequent etiological agents of gas-gangrene in man. This disease arises as a consequence of the infection of deep tissue wounds by the bacterium, with the subsequent production of toxins. Of these, the alpha-toxin, a zinc-dependent phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C (PC-PLC)1 plays the major role in disease.2,3 Alpha-toxin has been shown to cause vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation4 and to modulate the host immune response by causing the mistrafficking of neutrophils.5 Collectively these effects reduce the oxygen content of the local environment and perturb the host response to infection, thus allowing

the growth and proliferation of the bacterium.6 It is proposed that these effects are elicited as a consequence of the action of the alpha-toxin on host cell membrane phospholipids with the subsequent generation of secondary messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and activation of the arachidonic acid cascade.6 ­ 8 The structure of alpha-toxin, at pH 7.5, in a conformation where the active site is accessible to substrate (the "open" conformation) has been described already.9 It reveals a two-domain protein, with the active site located in the aminoterminal (N-terminal) domain, and contains three zinc ions. This domain is composed of nine tightly packed alpha helices, predominantly in antiparallel and parallel pairs, and shows 29% sequence identity over 245 residues to Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), whose structure is known.10 The carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) domain of alpha-toxin has been identified as an analogue of the eukaryotic C2 domains.9 C2 domains are eight-stranded, anti-parallel, b-sandwich domains,

which normally possess a calcium-dependent membrane binding ability.11 They are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, notably the metabolism of phospholipids and the regulation of lipid-based secondary messengers.11 Like most enzymes that possess a C2 domain, alpha-toxin requires Ca2þ for full activity.12 A crystal structure obtained at pH 4.7 revealed Ca2þ bound to the carboxy-terminal domain and the isolated C-domain of alpha-toxin has been shown to bind Ca2þ by spectroscopic methods.13 Removal of the C-terminal domain from alpha-toxin abolished activity towards membrane or micelle-bound phospholipids but activity towards monodispersed phospholipids was retained.14 Overall, these findings indicate that the C-terminal domain of alphatoxin plays a key role in the Ca2þ-mediated recognition of membrane phospholipids. Here, we report the 3D-structure determination, by X-ray analysis, of a crystal form, grown at pH 4.6, in which the N-terminal domain of alphatoxin adopts a conformation in which the active site has been obscured and is no longer accessible to substrate (Figure 1). In addition, a zinc ion has been lost from the active site. We discuss these loop movements with reference to the open structure. Comparison with the calcium-bound

structure at pH 4.6 shows that the loop movements are independent of the presence of calcium ions in the C-terminal domain, which will therefore not be described here.

Overall structure The structure of alpha-toxin described here was solved at pH 4.6 by a combination of isomorphous and molecular replacement methods and refined to a working R-factor of 0.188 and a free R-factor of 0.233 for 56,901 reflections in the resolution ° range 30­ 1.98 A. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, which are related by a pseudo-translation of approximately c/2 along the c-axis. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were only applied in the early stages of refinement (Table 1). At the end of refinement the two molecules had a root-mean° square (r.m.s.) difference of 0.17 A for all interpretable C atoms. The main chain was clearly traced in both molecules with the exception of residues 59 ­67, which had weak and disconnected electron density. Apart from these residues, all but the most flexible, surface-exposed side-chains were clearly seen.

C. perfringens alpha-toxin (strain CER89L43) was expressed, purified and crystallised as described.30 Derivative data were collected on a 180 mm MarResearch ImagePlate with a Siemens rotating anode generator at 40 kV and 90 mA. Native data were obtained at stations 9.5 and 7.2 of the synchrotron radiation source at the Daresbury Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, using a 300 mm MarResearch ImagePlate. All data were processed using the DENZO31 program suite, scaled and merged with SCALEPACK.31 The R32 cell   dimensions are a ¼ b ¼ 151:4 A; c ¼ 195:5 A; a ¼ b ¼ 908; and g ¼ 1208 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of approximately 50%. Initial phasing was based on a molecular replacement solution from AMoRe32 using an incompletely traced copy of the open form as the model and a single heavy atom derivative, resulting from soaking a crystal in ethylmercury chloride (EMC). The heavy atom positions were refined with MLPHARE.33,34 Phases were improved using solvent flattening and both non-crystallographic and cross-crystal averaging from DMMulti.34,35 Model building was carried out with O29 and refinement with X-PLOR version 3.85136 initially and REFMAC34,37 in the later stages.

The final free-R and R-factors are 23.3% and 18.8%, respectively. PROCHECK39 calculations show that the geometries of the residues are comparable with other structures at ° 2.0 A resolution. Of all residues built into both chains 93.5% of the non-glycine, non-proline residues lie within the most favoured region of the Ramachandran plot, 6.1% lie in additionally allowed regions. a MFID, mean fractional isomorphous difference. b FOM, figure of merit. c S/s, peak height/noise. d cc, correlation coefficient. e Natoms, non-hydrogen atoms. f As calculated by SIGMAA.40

Overall, the structure of this conformation of alpha-toxin is similar to that of the open (pH 7.5) form except for the loop changes described later (Figures 1 and 2(a)). The angle between the two domains differs by 48 in the conformation. There ° is an r.m.s. deviation of 0.4 A between Ca atoms of equivalent residues in the N-terminal domains of each conformation, with the exception of residues 55­ 93 and 132­ 149, which form the two mobile loops. The N-terminal domain The N-terminal domain of the closed form consists of ten helices, one more than in the open crystal form (Figures 1 and 2(a) and (b)). Between helices B2 and C2 run two loops, one of which approaches the C-terminal domain and is interrupted by a short helix, C1 (Figure 2(b)), which is unique to the closed structure. The active site contains two zinc ions approxi° mately 3.6 A apart (Figure 3). These ions are in positions identical with those of the zinc ion (Zn1: co-ordinated by Trp1, His11 and Asp130) and one

of the cadmium ions (Cd3: co-ordinated by Asp56, His68, His126 and Asp130) of the previously reported open structure, and are analogous to two of the three zinc sites identified in the B. cereus PC-PLC structure.10 Movements in two loops may open and close the active site In the closed form of the structure, we have found no evidence for the third zinc ion seen in the open form. However, we have found considerable changes in two loops close to the third zincbinding site (Figure 2(a)). These two loops are on either side of the active site cleft, on the face of the toxin molecule that is believed to interact with the surface of the membrane.9 The first of these loops (residues 55 ­93; loop 1), from the end of helix B2 to the start of helix C2, is interrupted by the new helix and lies between the active site cleft and the cleft between the N and C-terminal domain. The second loop (residues 132 ­ 149; loop 2), from the end of helix D to the start of helix E, contains residues involved in the binding of the third zinc

in the open form (Figure 2(a)) and is on the opposite side of the active site to loop 1 (Figure 2(a)). Loop one The conformational changes to loop 1 enable it to interact with the C-terminal domain in the closed structure. In the open structure the only ionic interaction between this loop and the C-terminal domain is through a water molecule hydrogen bonding both Asp92 (Od1) and Thr308 (O1). In the closed form a water molecule hydrogen bonds with Leu86 (O), Tyr88 (O) and Lys310 (N). An additional hydrogen bond is made between Phe78 (O) and Lys310 (Nf) (Figure 2(b)).

In both the open and closed conformations, loop 1 contains a stretch of residues for which the electron density is too weak to allow the backbone to be traced; however, the weak electron density occurs in a different part of the loop for each conformation. In the open conformation, residues 84­88 could never be traced. These residues interact with their equivalents in a symmetry-related molecule in the open crystal structure, and the poor density is likely to be the result of disorder in that part of the protein chain. In contrast, residues 84­88 can be traced in the closed conformation, but there is very poor electron density for residues 59­67. The disorder in this part of the molecule, which is distant from any crystal contacts, appears to be the result of

the absence of divalent metal ions bound to the C-terminal domain of the toxin.13 Another feature of the change in this loop is the introduction, in the closed form, of a helix, running from residues 73 ­80 (Figure 2). Crystal packing in the closed form would not be possible if this loop were in the open conformation since main chain clashes would occur between residues 78­ 83 and residues 203 ­219 of the N-terminal domains of symmetry-related molecules. However, the Ca atoms for 203 ­ 219 of the two forms have an r.m.s. ° fit of 0.312 A. The only significant side-chain changes are in Met210, where x2 ¼ 908 and 1688 and Trp214 where x2 ¼ 21048 and 1178 for the open and closed forms, respectively. Consequently we are confident that the nature of the secondary structure of the loops and the stabilising interactions which go with them, in particular those of helix C1, are biologically relevant changes, resulting in the closure of the active site, rather than being the result of crystal packing distortions. Two other striking interactions were seen in the closed structure: Asp71 (Od2) forms a hydrogen bond with Lys201 (Nf) in the N-terminal domain and a salt bridge was formed between the sidechains of Asp75 and Arg99 (Figure 2(b)). Together these interactions hold the loop in place away from the membrane binding plane and stabilise the small helix C1. The result of these conformational changes was to bring residues His68 (which co-ordinates a zinc ion in both structures), Phe69 and Tyr135 into the region in the open structure area where these residues co-ordinate the third zinc (Figure 3).

Loop two Loop two lies on the surface of the protein which we propose binds to membranes and is stabilised by 13 H-bonds over the 15 residues in the open structure. Most of these are between main chain atoms, three are mediated by water, and there is

also one from Thr141 (N) to Asp144 (Og1) and another from Thr141 (Og1) to Val143 (N) and Asp144 (N). His136 and His148, which are involved in the co-ordination of the Cd2þ occupying zinc-binding site Cd2 in the open form, which is lost in this conformation, are also found in this loop (Figure 3). Instead of ligating a divalent ion as in the open structure, in the closed structure His136 hydrogen bonds to three water molecules through Nd1, N12 and its main chain oxygen. From 135 to 142 the structure is solvated by 11 H-bonds to ten water molecules which themselves are H-bonded to other water molecules. A tight turn at the end of this loop is stabilised by H-bonds from Val143 (N) to His148 (O) and Asp144 (Od1) to Gly147 (N) and His148 (N). Two H-bonds between the side-chains of Asp144 and His148 are also involved in stabilising this turn. His148 (N12) also hydrogenbonds Asp56 (Od2). Thus, His148 is prevented from co-ordinating a third zinc ion. Asp56 is involved in the co-ordination of the ion at site Cd3 in both structures (Figure 3). Indeed the binding sites for the tightly bound metal ions of the open structure are not significantly different in the closed form. This is not surprising as at least one of these ions appears to be required for the structural integrity of the N-terminal domain,15 in the same way as is proposed for the two tightly bound zincs of B. cereus PC-PLC.10 The overall effect of this loop change is to bring the side-chain of His148 from its zinc binding position to the side of the active site cleft, resulting in the burial of the active site on that side. In addition, there is a movement of another of the three essential zinc binding residues, His136, from the binding pocket of the third zinc. The result is that only two zinc ions are found in the molecule (Figure 3). Biological relevance of the loop changes Assuming that the alpha-toxin structure reported here is an example of a structure that can

280

be found in solution, the question arises as to the possible functional significance of the closed form of the enzyme. Comparison of the crystallisation conditions of the toxin structure that have been solved does not enable easy conclusions to be drawn regarding the condition under which open and closed forms of the toxin occur. A number of workers have previously investigated the kinetic mechanism of alpha-toxin, and have concluded that activation of the enzyme occurs.16 ­ 18 The mechanism of activation is generally proposed to involve calcium ions. Indirect evidence has also been presented that activation is associated with conformational changes in the protein.16,18 There is also some evidence from mutagenesis studies that residues within loop 1 play key roles in the biological activity of alpha-toxin, though their roles have not previously been identified. Nagahama & Sakurai19 reported that a Thr74Ile variant form of alpha-toxin showed a 250-fold reduction of haemolytic, lecithinase and sphingomyelinase activity whilst Guillouard et al.20 reported that a Phe69Cys variant was devoid of haemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities and showed a 280-fold reduction in lecithinase activity. We believe these amino acid substitutions caused changes in the conformation of loop 1, thereby modulating enzymatic activity and toxicity. In addition, residues Asp71, Lys201, Phe78, Lys310, and Arg99, which participate in salt bridges stabilising the closed conformation of loop 1, are conserved between C. perfringens alpha-toxin and the related phospholipases C from Clostridium bifermentans and Clostridium novyi. However, Asp75 (which forms a salt bridge with Arg99 in the closed conformation) is replaced by glycine in the C. bifermentans protein. Whilst both the C. perfringens and C. novyi proteins are lethal toxins, the C. bifermentans protein is non-toxic,1 suggesting that the conformation of this loop may be important for activity. Though it has already been proposed that open and closed forms of lipases exist,21 ­ 24 this is the first example of such a conformational change in a phospholipase. In the triacylglycerol lipases one loop movement uncovers the active site and a second, smaller loop change results in the formation of the enzyme's oxyanion hole. These changes allow lipid access to the active site.21,25 A similar situation has been described here. Given that one purpose of alpha toxin is to lyse cells, it seems reasonable that the toxin would benefit from a mechanism that allowed it to discriminate between phospholipid in intact membrane and that from already lysed cells. The attachment of the C2-like domain to an intact membrane may then act as a trigger to open the active site of the toxin, which would close after detachment from the membrane. This would result in the cleavage of only those phospholipids that constitute part of an intact cell and result in an increase in the rate of cell lysis by the toxin over one which could not make such discriminations.
