The three-dimensional solution structure of (Cd2+)1-calbindin D9k has been determined by distance geometry, restrained molecular dynamics and relaxation matrix calculations using experimental constraints obtained from two-dimensional 1H and 15N-1H NMR spectroscopy. The final input data consisted of 1055 NOE distance constraints and 71 dihedral angle constraints, corresponding to 15 constraints per residue on average. The resulting ensemble of 24 structures has no distance or dihedral angle constraints consistently violated by more than 0.07 Å and 1.8°, respectively. The structure is characteristic of an EF-hand protein, with two helix-loop-helix calcium binding motifs joined by a flexible linker, and a short anti-parallel b-type interaction between the two ion-binding sites. The four helices are well defined with a root mean square deviation from the mean coordinates of 0.35 Å for the backbone atoms. The structure of the half-saturated cadmium state was compared with the previously determined solution structures of the apo and fully calcium saturated calbindin D9k . The comparisons were aided by introducing the ensemble averaged distance difference matrix as a tool for analyzing differences between two ensembles of structures. Detailed analyses of differences between the three states in backbone and side-chain dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds, interatomic distances, and packing of the hydrophobic core reveal the reorganization of the protein that occurs upon ion binding. Overall, it was found that (Cd2+)1-calbindin D9k , representing the half-saturated calcium state with an ion in site II, is structurally more similar to the fully calcium-saturated state than the apo state. Thus, for the binding sequence apo : (Ca2+)II : (Ca2+)I,II, 1 2 the structural changes occurring upon ion binding are most pronounced for the first binding step, an observation that bears significantly on the molecular basis for cooperative calcium binding in calbindin D9k .

Introduction
Calbindin D9k is a small calcium binding protein of 75 residues. It belongs to the calmodulin superfamily of proteins, which is characterized by a common helix-loop-helix structural motif (the EF-hand; Kretsinger & Nockolds, 1973) for the calcium binding sites. The basic structural­functional unit in these proteins is a pair of EF-hands rather than the individual binding site (Seamon & Kretsinger, 1983), a property that imparts the ability to bind calcium ions cooperatively. Furthermore, the EF-hand proteins typically exhibit a markedly asymmetric distribution of charged side-chains, with a high

103 1991a). In-depth comparisons of the (Cd2+ )2 and (Ca2+ )2 states and recent experiments demonstrating cooperativity in the binding of cadmium (Akke et al., 1991a, 1993b; Linse & Chazin, 1995) indicate that the binding sequence apo : (Cd2+ )1 : (Ca2+ )2 does accurately portray DDGII:I,II. Thus, by comparing the structural and dynamical differences between these three states, aspects of the reorganization of the protein that contribute to the free energy of this cooperative effect can be identified. The sequential assignment and identification of secondary structure and global folding pattern of wild-type (Cd2+ )1-calbindin D9k have been reported (Akke et al., 1991a). Here we present the threedimensional solution structure of (Cd2+ )1-P43G bovine calbindin D9k determined from NMR distance and dihedral angle constraints using distance geometry (DG), restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) and relaxation matrix calculations. The analysis is then extended to detailed comparisons with the high-resolution NMR solution structures that have recently been determined for the calcium-loaded (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993) and apo (Skelton et al., 1994, 1995) states. These results provide an in-depth characterization of the structural changes that occur upon binding of ions to calbindin D9k , and provide a firm basis for assessing the structural contributions to the cooperative effects in the binding of calcium ions.

density of negatively charged side-chains around the ion binding sites. Calbindin D9k consists of a single pair of EF-hands, and binds two calcium ions with high affinity (K0108 M-1 ) and positive cooperativity (Linse et al., 1987, 1991). The removal of negative charges by site-directed mutagenesis has been found to cause significant reductions in calcium affinity (Linse et al., 1991; Svensson et al., 1991). In the light of these results, the cooperative binding of calcium ions may seem counterintuitive, since binding of the first ion will reduce the net negative charge of the protein, i.e. on the basis of the electrostatic interactions alone, one would thus expect a lowered affinity for the second ion. One consequence of this line of reasoning is that the molecular basis for the observed positive cooperativity is likely to involve reorganization of the structure and dynamics of the protein upon binding of ions. Characterization of the structural and dynamical features of the apo state, the two half-saturated states and the fully calcium-saturated state of the protein is therefore imperative. Insights into the molecular basis for the cooperativity can then be obtained by comparing the observed structural and dynamical differences that correspond to the free energy differences between the different states. We have previously reported on a number of NMR studies that describe the changes in structure and dynamics that occur upon stepwise ion binding in calbindin D9k (Akke et al., 1991a, 1993a; Skelton et al., 1992a,b; Carlstrom & Chazin, 1993; ¨ Wimberly et al., 1995). In the wild-type protein and the P43G mutant, the affinities of the two sites for the first ion are nearly equal, DGI1DGII (Linse et al., 1987, 1991). This, in combination with the observed positive cooperativity, DDG = DGI,II - DGI = DGII,I - DGII < 0, implies that the affinity of the second ion is higher than that of the first ion in the two step-wise (consecutive) binding sequences, DDGII:I,II = DGI,II - DGII < 0 and DDGI:II,I = DGII,I - DGI < 0. Note that DDGII:I,II and DDGI:II,I are not necessarily equal, and that these cooperative effects are different from cooperativity in non-symmetric systems like calbindin D9k (or any monomeric protein). Since the cooperative binding of calcium ions precludes the study of the two half-saturated calcium states under equilibrium conditions, we take advantage of the sequential binding of Cd2+ to prepare (Cd2+ )1-calbindin D9k as a model for the half-saturated calcium state with an ion bound to the C-terminal site (Ca2+ )II (Vogel et al., 1985; Akke et al., I
 Wild-type calbindin D9k exists in two isoforms due to cis-trans isomerization of the G42-P43 peptide bond (Chazin et al., 1989a). The conformationally homogeneous P43G mutant has been utilized to circumvent the problems caused by the presence of two sets of resonances in the NMR spectra. Differences in the structural and dynamical properties relative to either of the two wild-type isoforms are minimal (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1990). References herein to ``calbindin D9k '' should be taken to mean the P43G mutant, unless otherwise indicated.

Results and Discussion
Experimental input constraints In total, 945 distance constraints (203 intra-residue, 237 sequential, 240 medium range and 265 long range), and 71 (40f, 27x1 and 4x2 ) dihedral angle constraints, were included in the structure calculations at the DG stage. In the rMD calculations, the number of distance constraints was increased to 1055, due solely to the adjustment in the treatment of non-stereospecifically assigned protons. No cadmium ion or constraints for the coordinating ligands were included in any stage of the structure calculations. Out of 82 diastereotopic pairs of side-chain amide and CbH2 methylene protons and methyl groups, 14 have degenerate shifts and 20 exhibit evidence for conformational averaging. Stereo-specific assignments were made for 36 of the remaining 48 diastereotopic pairs, including all three pairs of valine methyl groups, five out of eight non-degenerate pairs of leucine methyl groups, and four out of six side-chain amide groups. In addition, one isoleucine CgH2 methylene pair and one proline CdH2 pair were stereospecifically assigned. Figure 1A shows the distribution of NOE constraints along the protein sequence. It is apparent that certain parts of the protein have a considerably lower constraint density, viz the N and C termini, the linker loop, and parts of the two ion-binding sites. Information available from previous 15N relaxation studies (Akke et al., 1993a) shows that the termini and

Global description of the structure A superposition of the final 24 structures of (Cd2+ )1-calbindin D9k is shown in Figure 2, revealing a great similarity to the solution structure of apo (Skelton et al., 1994, 1995) and calcium-saturated (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993) states. The main feature of the structure is four helices organized in a sequentially antiparallel manner. The first and second helices and the first ion-binding loop joining the two helices constitute the N-terminal EF-hand. The third and fourth helices together with the second ion-binding loop form the C-terminal EF-hand. The two EF-hands are assembled in a head-to-head orientation, with the linker loop at one end and a short anti-parallel b-type interaction between two ionbinding loops at the other end, thus forming a single compact globular domain that is common to many

the linker loop are more mobile on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale than are other parts of the protein; thus, the low number of constraints in these regions is likely due to the higher flexibility. In contrast, since the relative mobility of the backbone of the ion-binding loops is similar to that of the helices, the low constraint density in these regions is most likely due to their peripheral location and

105 sons in Table 2. The average pairwise RMSD for the ° backbone atom coordinates of the helices is 0.50 A, while the corresponding value for all backbone ° atoms is 1.24 A. Figure 1B displays the average RMSD from the average coordinates as a function of residue number, after best-fit superposition of the backbone N, Ca and C atoms of all residues. As typically observed for NMR solution structures, the local RMSD correlates inversely with constraint density (see Figure 1A). The regions of the protein that have high RMSD values are the C terminus, the linker loop and the two ion-binding loops. Contrary to the case in the apo and (Ca2+ )2 states, the N terminus is rather well defined, as a consequence of a number of medium range NOEs involving the three first residues (K1, S2 and P3). However, the 15N relaxation data suggest that the backbone at the N terminus is about as flexible as parts of the linker loop and the C terminus. Hence, these NOEs may arise from one or more specific conformational states from a larger ensemble. Interestingly, the 3Jab coupling constants for K1 indicate that the side-chain populates one rotamer predominantly. Figure 3 shows each of the two EF-hands superimposed by minimizing the RMSD for the backbone atom coordinates of all four helical segments. The backbone of the helices and the b-type interaction, as well as most side-chains that pack into the interior of the protein are well defined whereas side-chains on the surface are less well defined. The local fitting of each helix results in average backbone

members of the calmodulin family of calcium-binding proteins.

Quality and precision of the structures Table 1 summarizes the residual constraint violations and energies, all of which attest to the high quality of the structures. The average Lennard-Jones and total molecular energies are negative and large in magnitude, as expected for well refined structures. Each structure has good non-bonded contacts with very small deviations from idealized covalent geometry; the average RMSD values from the ° ideality of bond lengths and angles are 0.005 A and 0.03°, respectively. The average constraint energy is 12.6(21.4) kcal/mol, with an average maximum ° distance violation of 0.176(20.047) A and an average maximum dihedral angle violation of 7.1(21.8)°. No distance constraints are consistently violated by ° more than 0.07 A, and no dihedral angle constraints are consistently violated by more than 1.8°. Among the different structures, the maximum distance violation occurs for different constraints, typically in rather ill-defined regions with low constraint density, as discussed (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993; Skelton et al., 1995). These observations indicate that the larger violations do not compromise the accuracy of the structural ensemble.

This representation of the structures complements Figure 1B and 2 in revealing the different degrees of precision with

which the different regions are defined. Again, the helices and the b-type interaction clearly have a much higher precision than the C terminus and the loop regions. In total, 38 out of 64 (59%) x1 dihedral angles (not counting proline residues) are confined to the same rotamer in all 24 structures. Among these are 14 residues for which no x1 dihedral constraints were included in the structure calculations: K1, K7, E11, K12, E27, L28, L31, L39, T45, E65, F66, Q67, L69 and I73. Of these 14 residues, K1 and E27 have 3Jab

107 range, but the (L6, S2) hydrogen bond is present in all 24 structures. Consecutive a-helical (i, i - 4) hydrogen bonds run from (L6, S2) to (A15, E11), although there is a slight kink in the helix at Y13, which has a f dihedral angle of -78.4(21.5)°. K16 HN exhibits an (i, i - 3) hydrogen bond to Y13 CO in 19 structures, while the K16 c dihedral angle is outside the standard helical range. A helix-capping hydrogen bond between S2 Og and E5 HN is observed in 19 structures. In loop I, a well-defined type I turn is found at D19­Q22, with the backbone dihedral angles of P20 and N21 all having a standard deviation of less than 10°, and the (Q22, D19) hydrogen bond being present in 21 structures. In some structures, the segment A14­E17 adopts a type I turn conformation, but overall the c dihedral angle of K16 is poorly defined and the (E17, A14) hydrogen bond is present in only 50% of the structures. Helix II extends from S24 to F36, with the a-helical (i, i - 4) hydrogen bonds present throughout the helix. S24 is also involved in the b-type interaction

coupling constants indicating a unimodal rotamer population, but the available experimental information is insufficient to generate a dihedral angle constraint. Residues F66, L69 and I73 have coupling constants clearly indicating conformational averaging between rotamers. Reliable coupling-constant information could not be obtained for the other residues. Detailed description of the structure The identification of helical structure elements is made as described previously (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993), based on a combination of (i, i - 3) and/or (i, i - 4) hydrogen bonds and backbone dihedral angles (f = -60°(220)°; c = -40(220)°). Figure 5 shows the hydrogen bonds that are present in at least 18 out of the 24 final structures, and also indicates which amide protons exhibit slow exchange with the solvent (Skelton et al., 1992b). Helix I extends through residues S2 to K16. The c dihedral angle of S2 is clearly outside the expected

In all cases, the hydrogen bond donor (HN) is the atom with higher residue number. The spheres depict the amino acid residues, with the thick lines connecting the residues in sequence. The thick lines connecting roughly every fourth residue in the helices have been left out for clarity.

Two (i, i - 3) hydrogen bonds are depicted as bent lines: (E5, S2) in the (Ca2+ )2 state and (L69, F66) in the (Cd2+ )1 state. For clarity, hydrogen bonds involving side-chains atoms have been left out of the Figure.

between the ion binding loops, and its backbone dihedral angles are clearly in the b region of (f, c) space. S24 Og contributes a helix-capping hydrogen bond to E27 HN in 15 structures. Although the c dihedral angles of E35 and F36 are outside the helical region of (f, c) space, the (E35, L31) and (F36, L32) hydrogen bonds are both present in all 24 structures. Hydrogen bonds (L39, F36) and (L40, F36) are present in 11 and 17 structures, respectively, indicating a rather poorly defined extension of the helix into the linker loop. The remaining segment (L40­S44) of the linker is very poorly defined. Helix III starts at T45 with an a-helical (i, i - 4) hydrogen bond to L49, although T45 has a c dihedral angle outside the standard helical range. The helix continues with regular (i, i - 4) a-helical hydrogen bonds through to D54, and ends with a partially populated hydrogen bond between K55 and L53 (present in 15 structures). A helix-capping hydrogen bond is observed between T45 Og and E48 HN in 16 structures. Helix IV is less regular than the other helices, although it starts with S62 in a manner parallel to S24 in the first EF-hand; S62 had b-type backbone dihedral angles, but forms the (F66, S62) helical hydrogen bond. F63 CO is hydrogen bonded to a side-chain amide proton of Q67 in 19 structures. The segment E64­L69 contains three consecutive (i, i - 3) hydrogen bonds, followed by four consecutive (i, i - 4) hydrogen bonds, extending helix IV to I73. All of the corresponding backbone dihedral angles are within the helical range. The C-terminal residues S74 to Q75 exhibit large variations in the backbone dihedral angles, although the (S74, V70) hydrogen bond is present in 23 structures. The ion-binding loops are connected by an antiparallel b-type interaction between residues Q22 to S24 and E60 to S62, evident from their backbone

dihedral angles and a pair of ``cross-strand'' hydrogen bonds between L23 and V61 (present in all structures). In each of the two loops there is an ill-defined segment of three to four residues preceding the b-type interaction. In loop I, E17 to D19 show large uncertainties in their backbone dihedral angles, and in loop II the corresponding residues are N56 to G59. The ion-binding loops are also characterized by numerous hydrogen bonds involving both ion-ligating and non-ligating side-chains, including N21 HN­D19 Od1/2 (in 20 structures), N21 He1/2­D19 Od1/2 (21), G59 HN­D54 Od1/2 (19), S24 HN­E27 Oe1/2 (16), N56 He1/2­D58 Od1/2 (12), and S62 OH­E65 Oe1/2 (14). These are combined with the accompanying backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds to create a tight network of interactions within the binding loops. The backbone and side-chains in loop II have conformations that are consistent with the coordination of a cadmium ion, which is assumed to be identical to the coordination of calcium in the X-ray crystal structure of calbindin D9k (side-chain carboxylates of D54, N56, D58 and E65 (bidentate) plus the backbone O of E60; Szebenyi & Moffat, 1986; Svensson et al., 1992). The similarity in the coordination of calcium and cadmium is corroborated by 113Cd NMR (Vogel et al., 1985) and the X-ray crystal structure of the related calcium-binding protein parvalbumin in the (Cd2+ )2 state (Swain et al., 1989). In the structure of (Cd2+ )1-calbindin D9k , the side-chains of D54 and E65 are well defined and clearly positioned for ion chelation, whereas the D58 side-chain is uniformly oriented towards the binding site but only its x1dihedral angle is rather well defined and the N56 side-chain is found to occupy two conformations, one pointing towards the binding site and the other towards the solvent. The lower resolution of the N56 and D58 side-chains is

109 conformations of individual residues that are inaccurate can be ascribed to artifacts associated with rMD refinement in vacuo, or ``pinning'' due to mutually exclusive constraints from more than one conformation, as has been discussed (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993; Skelton et al., 1995).

correlated with the poor definition of the backbone segment N56­G59. The agreement between the solution structure of the (Cd2+ )1 state and the (Ca2+ )2 state crystal structure (4icb; Svensson et al., 1992) was further analyzed by superimposing the backbone atoms of the binding loop (D54­E65) and measuring distances between the relevant oxygen atoms and the calcium ion. The mean distances and standard deviations within the structural ensemble (with the corresponding distances in the crystal structure in ° parentheses) are: D54 Od1, 2.16(20.37) A (2.41); D54 ° ° Od2, 3.68(20.63) A (4.32); N56 Od1, 5.10(22.90) A ° (2.34); D58 Od1, 0.09(20.90) A (2.38); D58 Od2, ° ° 2.17(20.80) A (3.56); E60 O, 2.95(20.32) A (2.39); e1 ° (2.54); E65 Oe2, 2.54(20.38) A ° E65 O , 2.46(20.45) A (2.54). For N56, if only the 12 structures that have a N56­G59 backbone conformation consistent with that observed in the crystal structure are considered, ° the distance becomes 2.72(20.82) A. Overall, the agreement is very good, particularly considering the absence of ions and constraints between ligands in the structure calculations, with details as fine as the bidentate nature of coordination by E65 clearly evident. Good correlation is observed between backbone amide hydrogen bonds in the solution structure and the rate of exchange with solvent (Skelton et al., 1992). Most of the slowly exchanging backbone amide protons (kex < 10-3 s-1 ) are found to be hydrogen bonded in more than 75% of the solution structures (Figure 5). The only exceptions are E27 and K55 (both hydrogen bonded in 62% of the structures), E60 HN (42%), and E65 HN (25%). Furthermore, L49, E52, N56, G57, G59 and V68 exhibit intermediate exchange rates (10-3 s-1 < kex < 10-2 s-1 ), and of these only N56 is hydrogen bonded in less than 50% of the solution structures (42% occurrence). A poor correlation between hydrogen bonds and exchange rates is found for only nine residues (L6­G8, A15­K16, K71­S74), all of which form hydrogen bonds in the solution structures, but do not exhibit slowed rates of exchange (kex < 10-2 s-1 ); however, these residues all exhibit NOEs characteristic of a-helical structure. There are no cases where slowed exchange is observed, but no hydrogen bonds are found in the structures. Comparisons with the apo and (Ca2+ )2 structures This section illustrates the structural changes in calbindin D9k associated with the binding of calcium by comparing the three-dimensional structures of the apo, (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states. We focus initially on details at a very local level, comparing the dihedral angles and hydrogen-bonding patterns of each structural element in turn. The analysis is then progressively built up to higher order, global comparisons. At each stage, great care has been taken not to include differences that are unreliable due to low precision or obvious inaccuracy. The poorly defined regions generally arise due to limited experimental constraints, while a small number of

Dihedral angles and hydrogen bonds
In the N-terminal EF-hand, the hydrogen bonding pattern of helix I differs at its N terminus: the apo and (Cd2+ )1 states have the (L6, S2) hydrogen bond, whereas the (Ca2+ )2 state has the (E5, S2) hydrogen bond. There is also a subtle difference in the kink at Y13. The apo state has a mixture of roughly equal populations of the (Y13, I9) and (Y13, F10) hydrogen bonds, whereas the other two states have only the (Y13, I9) hydrogen bond, and the last hydrogen bond of helix I, (K16, Y13), is present in only 64% of the apo structures. Helix I exhibits differences in only two side-chain dihedral angles. The x2 angle of I9 is different in the apo and (Ca2+ )2 states, but poorly defined in the (Cd2+ )1 state, with a mean value in between those of the other two states. E11 occupies the same x1 rotamer (-60°) in the apo and (Cd2+ )1 states, but a different rotamer (180°) in the (Ca2+ )2 state. In helix II, small differences are observed in the backbone at L28­L30 (Figure 4). In the (Ca2+ )2 state, the K29c and L30f angles are distinct from the other two states, whereas the (Cd2+ )1 state has a unique value for K29f and the apo state has a unique value for L28c. The deviations in the region of L30 in the (Ca2+ )2 state are associated with a kink in the helix, as further evidenced by the absence of the (L30, E26) hydrogen bond (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993). The differences in the backbone are correlated with differences in the side-chain of L28, where the x1 rotamer of the (Cd2+ )1 state (-60°) differs from that of the other two states (180°), and each state exhibits a different x2 rotamer (apo, -60°; (Cd2+ )1 , 180°; (Ca2+ )2 , 60°). At the C terminus of helix II, the x1 angle of E35 (-60°) in the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states is different from the apo state. However, this difference is not significant because the side-chain occupies an eclipsed and unreliable conformation in the apo state (Skelton et al., 1995). Significant changes associated with ion binding are observed within the binding loop of the N-terminal EF-hand. The only significant change observed in the backbone is the f angle of Q22, which is the same in the apo and (Cd2+ )1 states but different from the (Ca2+ )2 state. The x1 angle (-60°) of Q22 in the (Ca2+ )2 state is also significantly different from the rotamer observed in the (Cd2+ )1 state (180°), whereas it is poorly defined in the apo state. Several other side-chains are affected by ion binding. N21 and E27 are both found to occupy the same x1 rotamer (-60°) in the apo and (Cd2+ )1 states, whereas the (Ca2+ )2 state is different. The x1 angle of L23 is well defined and occupies the same rotamer in all three states, but the actual value in the (Ca2+ )2 state (-90(21)°) is significantly different from that in the

110 other two states (-68(23)°), and the 3Jab coupling constants indicate rotameric averaging in the apo state (Skelton et al., 1995). The x1 angle of K25 occupies a different rotamer in each state: 60° in apo, -60° in (Cd2+ )1 and 180° in (Ca2+ )2 . Changes in the C-terminal EF-hand are more extensive. In helix III, the L46f angle and the absence of the L49­T45 hydrogen bond is unique to the apo state. The (Ca2+ )2 state differs slightly from the other two states at F50c­R51f, but this does not affect the hydrogen bonding pattern for these residues. Also, the strained hydrogen bond (K55, L53) is present in 81% of the (Ca2+ )2 structures, but only in 58% and 62% of the apo and (Cd2+ )1 structures, respectively. Several of the side-chains in helix III are poorly defined in at least one of the three states, a consequence of an unusually high percentage of resonances that are overlapped. The methyl groups of L46 and L49 are typical examples, with chemical shifts either degenerate or overlapped with those of L39 and L40 leading to a scarcity of assigned NOEs. In addition, the 3Jab coupling constants indicate that many of the side-chains populate more than one x1 rotamer. As noted previously, helix III appears to be somewhat less integrally packed into the hydrophobic core than the other three helices (Skelton et al., 1994, 1995). Helix IV undergoes a number of changes in response to ion binding, the most notable being a transition from regular a-helical conformation in the apo state to mixed a and 310 conformation in the ion-bound states. The hydrogen bonding pattern of the apo state is very regular with consecutive (i, i - 4) hydrogen bonds, but ion binding is associated with significant changes (Figure 5); the (Cd2+ )1 state has one (i, i - 4), three (i, i - 3), then four (i, i - 4) hydrogen bonds, and the (Ca2+ )2 state has one (i, i - 4), two (i, i - 3) (of which one is populated to only 32% and not included in Figure 5), four (i, i - 4), then one (i, i - 3) hydrogen bonds. Along the backbone, the c angles of F66 and Q67 in the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states are indicative of 310 helix, whereas the values in the apo state are a-helical. In addition, the last turn of 310 helix in the (Ca2+ )2 state is reflected in the less negative values of the c angles of K72 and I73. The conformations of several side-chains are also affected by the level of ion occupancy. The x1 rotamer for Q67 is 180° in the apo state, but -60° in the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states. The mean values of x1 for I73 indicate that the (Ca2+ )2 state differs from the other two states, although the uncertainty is rather large in the apo and (Ca2+ )2 states; it is possible that this difference is related to the change from a to a mixed a/310 helical backbone conformation at the C terminus of helix IV in the (Ca2+ )2 state. In the C-terminal binding loop, the backbone of the (Ca2+ )2 state is unique in a short segment of the b interaction between the binding loops, at V61c­ S62f. Differences are observed for D58, which provides a side-chain ligand to the calcium ion; the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states both have a x1 rotamer of 60°, while this dihedral angle is poorly defined in the apo state with a mean value of 180°. Similarly, there

appear to be differences in the side-chain conformations of E64 and E65, although the definition is rather poor for E64 in the (Cd2+ )1 state and for E65 in the (Ca2+ )2 state.

Tertiary structure
Best-fit superpositions that minimize the atom coordinate RMSD are the traditional means for making comparisons of structures. The significance of the RMSD as a measure of similarity between structures has recently been comprehensively studied by Maiorov & Crippen (1994). Dissimilarity is evident if the deviations between the ensemble and a single structure are all greater than those among the ensemble itself. However, for the purpose of assessing differences between two (or more) ensembles in the relative positions of various regions of the structure, determining the RMSD after superposition of atom coordinates is not a strictly objective method in that the result is dependent on the set of atoms chosen for the RMSD optimization. Thus, it is not always straightforward to disentangle the details of structural differences from a limited number of optimized superpositions, even when complemented with visual inspection. Furthermore, the RMSD does not provide any information other than the absolute deviation of the atomic coordinates in the different ensembles, and any directionality of the structural changes has to be inferred by visual inspection. A more objective way of looking at structural differences is to compare the interatomic distances within each structure. The complete set of interatomic distances provides a definition of the molecular structure alternative to the Cartesian coordinates (Havel et al., 1983), and differences in the interatomic distances are therefore suitable for the description of structural changes. The advantage of the distance difference matrix (DDM, see Materials and Methods for details) is that it does not require superpositioning atomic coordinates, and therefore provides information directly on differences in the arrangement of structural elements in the ensembles of structures. Figure 6a and b shows the DDMs that represent the structural changes occurring upon binding of the first ion in the C-terminal EF-hand, apo : (Cd2+ )1 , and the second ion to the N-terminal EF-hand, (Cd2+ )1 : (Ca2+ )2 , respectively. Interatomic distances that become larger upon ion binding are colored in cyan, while distances that become smaller are colored in magenta. As an example of this analysis, consider the change from regular a-helical to 310 conformation in the N-terminal part of helix IV (vide supra). This transition is readily identified in the DDM as a pattern repeating for every third residue, with matrix elements alternating between positive (cyan) and negative (magenta) differences, as observed in the upper right corner of Figure 6a. The pattern reflects the shift in relative positions of residues along the helix axis, as a consequence of the

111 described in more detail below. Visualization of the structural changes upon stepwise ion binding can be augmented by displaying the interatomic distance differences on the structure as color coded lines connecting the atoms in question, as shown in Figure 7. The resulting ``web of marionette strings'' makes it clear how the different regions of the structure move in relation to each other upon binding of an ion. The main features of the changes can be generalized as small rigid body movements of the helices in relation to each other, together with changes in the position of the ion-binding loops. Upon binding of the first ion to the C-terminal site, helices I and II, I and III, and III and IV, all move ° closer to each other by 0.43, 1.48 and 1.52 A, respectively. At the same time, helices I and II both move further away from the N-terminal half of ° helix IV (residues F63 to V68) by 1.04 and 0.92 A, respectively. In addition, the binding loop in the ° C-terminal site moves away from helix II by 1.54 A °. and from the N-terminal binding loop by 0.82 A These values were calculated as the average distance between all interhelical pairs of Ca atoms in the respective polypeptide segments, and agree very well with the interhelix distances previously calculated using a different method for the apo and (Ca2+ )2 states (Skelton et al., 1995). These structural changes are rather small in most cases, and would not be readily discernible by simple inspection, such as that shown in Figure 8. The most distinctive features of the conformational response to the binding of the first ion are readily apparent in the distribution of DDM lines in Figure 7A and B, showing that significant changes occur for residues within the C-terminal EF-hand and between the two EF-hands, but not within the N-terminal EF-hand. Upon binding of the second ion to the N-terminal site, some of the changes occurring during the first step are reversed, although overall these changes are smaller than for the first binding step (Figures 6 and 7). Helices I and II, and III and IV move away from ° each other by 0.65 and 0.51 A, respectively. Helix I moves closer to the N-terminal part of helix IV by ° 0.43 A, and helices II and III move closer together by ° ° 0.45 A. Loop II moves closer to helix II by 1.07 A whereas the two binding loops move closer by ° 1.00 A. The closer proximity of the loops at this binding step is correlated with the changes in the backbone dihedral angles of loop residues Q22, V61 and S62 (Figure 4) described above. Once the DDM analysis was completed, a best-fit superposition was performed using the backbone atoms (N, Ca, C) of residues 3 to 15 (helix I) and 25 to 35 (helix II) only, since the DDM analysis revealed a high similarity among these two helices in all three states. Figure 8 shows the backbone coordinates of the (Cd2+ )1-calbindin D9k solution structure that is closest to the average coordinates, along with the corresponding structures of apo (Skelton et al., 1994) and (Ca2+ )2-calbindin D9k (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993) superimposed. It seems clear from Figure 8 and the DDMs, that the (Cd2+ )1 state is more similar to the

Comparison of distances between Ca atoms of the (Cd2+ )1­apo (A) and (Ca2+ )2­(Cd2+ )1 (B) states. The lower right half of the matrix shows the mean distance differences for all residue pairs, while the upper left half shows only those mean distance differences that are significant (larger than 2 standard deviations). The distance differences are color coded using a linear RGB (red, green, blue) scale, so that zero corresponds to blue ° (0, 0, 1), a positive difference of 1.0 A is cyan (0, 1, 1), and ° a negative difference of -1.0 A is magenta (1, 0, 1). Thus, a distance that becomes longer upon binding of an ion tends towards cyan, and a distance that becomes shorter tends towards magenta. The maximum positive and negative ° ° differences are 3.00 A (K29­G57) and -5.76 A (S44­V68) ° ° in A, and 5.33 A (K1­L46) and -2.81 A (E26­G57) in B.

(Ca2+ )2 state than to the apo state. The atom coordinate RMSD values suggest a trend supporting the notion that the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states are more similar to each other than to the apo state, but also indicate that the differences between the three ensembles are within 95% confidence limits for nearly all individual structural elements (Table 2). Within the N-terminal EF-hand, although the differences in general are small, the RMSD between the

(Cd2+ )1 ensemble and the average coordinates of the apo ensemble is statistically significant for helices I + II. Within the C-terminal EF-hand, there are significant RMS deviations between the apo and (Cd2+ )1 structures for helix IV as well as helices III + IV. The most distinctive characteristic of the RMSD comparisons between the apo and (Cd2+ )1 states is that there are significant differences for all paris of helices where each helix is from a different

EF-hand (I + III, I + IV, II + III, II + IV). These results are a clear indication that binding of the first ion causes a change in the packing of two EF-hands, as is readily apparent in Figure 7A. In contrast, not one of the corresponding comparisons indicates significant differences between the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states (see Figure 7C). Upon binding of an ion to the C-terminal EF-hand, helix III is translated along the helical axis towards the ion-binding loop (Figure 9C). In helix IV, a reorganization of roughly two turns of helix (F63­L69) occurs, with the backbone changing from regular a-helical conformation in the apo state to primarily 310 helix in the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states. As noted above, this transition in the backbone gives rise to an effective rotation of the C-terminal portion of Helix IV (Figure 9D), which is accompanied by a marked rearrangement in the packing of side-chains. This is most readily observed as a change in the packing of a side-chain from helix IV against the aromatic ring of F36, involving V70 in the apo state as opposed to I73 in the other two states (Figure 9D). This structural change is directly apparent from the change in the pattern of NOEs between the side-chains in this region. For example, NOEs are observed from the F36 ring to both V70 methyl groups in the apo state. These NOEs are absent in the (Cd2+ )1 state, and instead NOEs are observed

between the F36 and the I73 methyl groups. The change observed in the structure also correlates very well with a second direct experimental observation, that the most upfield shifted resonance in the apo state is a V70 methyl group (Skelton et al., 1990), whereas in the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states, it is an I73 methyl group (Ko ¨rdel et al., 1990; Akke et al., 1991a). As discussed previously, we attribute the structural changes upon ion binding in the C-terminal EF-hand to rearrangements of the side-chains required for ion ligation (Skelton et al., 1994, 1995). The structural shifts of the C-terminal EF-hand are accommodated within the framework of the largely unperturbed backbone in the N-terminal EF-hand (Figure 8). This requires re-packing of the hydrophobic core, resulting in numerous shifts in the interactions between the interior side-chains. In general, the reorganization of hydrophobic sidechains in the N-terminal EF-hand is much smaller than in the C-terminal hand. The effects of the large scale reorganization of residues in the C-terminal EF-hand can be described as long-range adjustments relayed through nested sets of interacting sidechains. In the following we describe specific shifts of the interior side-chains of the C-terminal EF-hand relative to the remainder of the protein (see Figure 9). Upon binding of the first ion, the F50 ring changes position with concomitant effects on residues in both

114 EF-hands, primarily L23, L28 and V61. One turn further along helix III, the shift of L53 mainly affects the C-terminal EF-hand residues V61 and L69. In helix IV, F66 contacts L31 and L69, while V70 contacts L6 and F36, which in turn contacts I73. Indirect and more subtle, changes associated with these largerscale shifts occur through side-chain interactions between L6, I9 and F36; L28, L31 and L32; L32 and L49. Of note, the indirect interaction between I73 and I9 that is relayed by F36 is reflected in the changes in side-chain rotamer states of these two residues (Figure 9A and D). In fact, many of the residues that exhibit significant differences in side-chain dihedral angles are observed to interact with each other, indicating concerted rearrangements: residues L23, E27 and L28 have extensive contacts, and L23, K25 and L28 pack closely together with the side-chain of F50. Binding of the first ion to the C-terminal site, associated with a large change in position of the F50 aromatic ring (Figure 9C), is seen to affect the side-chain dihedral angles of L23, K25 and L28. Similarly, binding of the second ion to the N-terminal site changes the rotameric state of E27, the critical side-chain that provides a bidentate calcium ligand, and has effects on L23 and L28 (Figure 9B). Many of these rearrangements thus serve to transmit structural information between the two EF-hands. The importance of the various ``transmission pathways'' can now be probed by site-directed mutagenesis. In summary, although numerous small differences exist, the organization of the hydrophobic cores of the (Cd2+ )1 and (Ca2+ )2 states are similar. They are both significantly different from the apo state as a consequence of rearrangements in the C-terminal EF-hand. The conformation of the side-chains in the two binding loops is important for maintaining the hydrogen bonding network within and between the two binding sites. These interactions have been proposed to be important for the cooperativity in calcium binding (Wesolowski et al., 1990; Linse et al., 1994. Of particular interest is the symmetrical pair of residues Q22 and E60, which bridge the two binding sites. In the crystal structure of the (Ca2+ )2 state, these residues both coordinate one calcium ion with the backbone oxygen, while the side-chain reaches over to coordinate the other calcium ion in the neighbouring site via a water molecule. Although the loops contain some of the least well-defined regions in the solution structure, it is clear that the conformations of the Q22 and E60 side-chains in all three states are maintained in the general orientation observed in the crystal structure of the (Ca2+ )2 state. The potential for these interactions between the side-chains and water molecules being present in the (Cd2+ )1 state was assayed by superimposing the backbone atoms of residues 21 to 25 and 59 to 63 of the (Cd2+ )1 structures onto the crystal structure, and measuring the distances between Q22 Oe1 or E60 Oe1/2 in the (Cd2+ )1 structures and the corresponding water oxygen atoms in the crystal structure. There is a striking similarity between the distances measured in the member of the (Cd2+ )1 structural ensemble

Solution Structure of (Cd 2+)1-calbindin D9k

closest to the mean (see Figure 8) and the crystal ° ° structure: 2.64 A and 2.68 A, respectively, in the 2+ ° and 2.64 A, respectively, ° (Cd )1 structure; and 2.62 A in the (Ca2+ )2 crystal structure (Svensson et al., 1992; Linse et al., 1994). For the full structural ensemble, the mean distances and standard deviations are ° ° 3.8(21.2) A and 3.3(21.2) A, respectively. These results suggest that the Q22 side-chain in the (Cd2+ )1 state is well-positioned to stabilize the critical water ligand in site II. In an effort to confirm these observations, studies are in progress to identify integral structural water molecules involved in the coordination of the ions in calbindin D9k (J. C. Madsen & W. J. Chazin, unpublished results). Concluding remarks In-depth analyses of the half-saturated states of calbindin D9k are required to obtain a complete understanding of the molecular basis for the cooperative binding phenomena. The three-dimensional solution structure of (Cd2+ )1-calbindin D9k described herein can be used as a model for the half-saturated state with a calcium ion bound in the C-terminal site. The validity of this model has been verified in a recent series of binding studies (Linse & Chazin, 1995). The detailed comparisons with the apo and (Ca2+ )2 states of the protein in terms of the DDM, RMSD of atom coordinates, backbone and side-chain dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds and packing of internal hydrophobic residues reveal the nature of the response of calbindin D9k to ion binding, i.e. quantitative information on the structural reorganization that accompanies each of the two steps of the apo : (Ca2+ )II : (Ca2+ )I,II binding 1 2 pathway has been generated. Changes in the fluctuations around the mean structure also contribute to the cooperative effect, as indicated by previous studies (Akke et al., 1991b, 1993a,c; Skelton et al., 1992b); in general, these results show the same pattern as the present results in that there is a larger reorganization upon binding of the first ion, and the entire protein is affected by the binding of the first ion to the C-terminal site. An understanding of the phenomena of cooperative binding also requires consideration of changes in the electrostatic potential and desolvation effects resulting from ion binding and structural changes. The availability of structures of all three states opens the door to detailed analysis of the role of electrostatic effects in the apo : (Ca2+ )II : (Ca2+ )I,II binding pathway. 1 2 Detailed structural changes of the backbone and within the core of the protein have been identified, showing how interactions between the two EF-hands can relay the structural effects of ion binding from the C-terminal site to the N-terminal site. Unfortunately, due to uncertainties in the currently available NMR structures, we do not yet have a complete picture of how the side-chains within the binding loops reorganize during the two binding steps. Nonetheless, the results obtained so far do provide the critical information that we seek to probe further the relationship between the protein reorganization

purification of the protein, and preparation of the (Cd2+ )1 state have been described (Brodin et al., 1986; Chazin et al., 1989b; Akke et al., 1991a; Skelton et al., 1992a). One unlabeled sample and one sample uniformly labeled with 15 N were used for the data collection. The samples were prepared in 0.42 ml 95% 1H2 O + 5% 2H2 O or pure 2H2 O (99.96%, MSD Isotopes) and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 (direct pH meter reading) by microliter additions of 0.1 M HCl or NaOH for the 1H2 O samples, or 0.1 M 2HCl or NaO2H for the 2H2 O samples. The final protein concentration was 4 to 5 mM. NMR spectroscopy All experiments were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer operating at 600.14 and 60.81 MHz for 1H and 15N, respectively. The following experiments were performed on the unlabeled sample. A TOCSY (Braunschweiler & Ernst, 1983) using 78 ms of DIPSI-2 mixing (Shaka et al., 1988) and a z-filter (Rance, 1987). The spectral widths were 12,500 Hz sampled over 4096 complex points in v2 , and 7000 Hz over 500 real points in v1 , utilizing the TPPI method for quadrature detection (Marion & Wuthrich, 1983). A total of 96 FIDs were ¨ collected for each t1 point. NOESY spectra (Macura & Ernst, 1980) were acquired with mixing times of 60 and 150 ms. The acquisition parameters were identical to those used in the TOCSY experiment, except that the spectral width in v1 was 6275 Hz. The 60 ms NOESY spectrum was recorded as two separate experiments, each with 64 FIDs collected per t1 increment, whereas the 150 ms NOESY spectrum was recorded with 96 FIDs. In order to improve the quality of the baseline in the TOCSY and NOESY experiments, sine-modulation of the interferograms was employed in the indirect dimension (Otting et al., 1986) and a spin-echo sequence was inserted prior to turning on the receiver ADC (Rance & Byrd, 1983; Davis, 1989). A COSY spectrum (Aue et al., 1976) was acquired with spectral widths of 6410 and 6400 Hz in v2 and v1 , sampled over 4096 complex and 300 real points, respectively. A total of 40 FIDs were recorded for each t1 point. All of the experiments described above were performed in 1H2 O, and the carrier was set to the 1H2 O resonance at 4.75 ppm. Solvent suppression was achieved by low power coherent irradiation of the 1H2 O resonance during the recovery delay, and also during the mixing time of the NOESY experiments. A COSY spectrum with a 35° flip angle for the mixing pulse (COSY-35; Aue et al., 1976; Bax & Freeman, 1981) was recorded in 2H2 O with spectral widths of 10,000 Hz in v2 and 3600 Hz in v1 , sampled over 4096 complex and 700 real points, respectively. A total of 128 FIDs were collected for each t1 point. In this experiment, the carrier frequency was set to 6 ppm, and no quadrature detection was employed in v1 . Solvent suppression was performed as described above. The following experiments were performed on the 15 N-labelled sample in 1H2 O. A 1H TOCSY experiment was performed as described above on the unlabeled sample, except that the mixing time was 73 ms and the spectral width in v1 was 6500 Hz. 1H­15N HSQC-NOESY (Bax et al., 1990; Norwood et al., 1990) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 60 and 100 ms, employing spin-lock purge pulses for solvent suppression (Messerle et al., 1989). These spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 1500 Hz in the 15N dimension, sampled over 300 and 150 points, respectively. In both cases, the acquisition parameters in t2 were the same as for the NOESY spectra acquired on the unlabeled sample, with the GARP-1 decoupling sequence (Shaka et al., 1985) applied to the 15N spins during the

and cooperative effects through the design of site-specific mutations of interior residues. Future work aimed at improving the precision of the ion-binding loops will add important details to the current level of the structural studies, and make possible a more complete comparison of changes in side-chain conformations and the hydrogen-bonding pattern within and between the two binding sites. Constraints between the protein atoms and the ions, and between the protein atoms and water molecules involved in coordination of the calcium ions, are likely to improve dramatically the definition of the binding sites. Refinement using explicit solvent molecules and full charges during the rMD calculations will further improve the accuracy of the representation of the solution structures (J. Ko ¨rdel, D. A. Pearlman and W. J. Chazin, unpublished results). Our results provide important insights into the molecular basis for the cooperative effect of calcium binding for the apo : (Ca2+ )II : (Ca2+ )I,II binding 1 2 pathway. The findings that the N-terminal EF-hand has a largely preformed binding site (Skelton et al., 1994, 1995), and that there is a large difference in structural reorganization needed for ion binding in the two sites, have important bearings on our interpretation of the co-operative effects in calbindin D9k . In general terms, the larger magnitude of reorganization accompanying the first binding step is likely associated with a more unfavourable change in free energy than the smaller reorganization associated with the second step (Akke et al., 1991a; Akke, 1993), thus contributing directly to a net positive cooperative effect (net negative DDGII:I,II ) for this binding pathway. Since the response to ion binding in the two EF-hands is different, it follows that the molecular basis for the cooperative effect of the other binding pathway (corresponding to DDGI:II,I ) is not likely to involve the same factors. However, this line of reasoning could break down if the communication between binding sites is so substantial that binding of the first ion to the N-terminal site is capable of triggering the large-scale reorganization of the C-terminal EF-hand. Clearly, a corresponding in-depth analysis of the complementary half-saturated state (Carlstrom & Chazin, 1993; Linse & ¨ Chazin, 1995; Wimberley et al., 1995) is needed in order to obtain a complete picture of the calcium binding process in calbindin D9k . The input constraints and the coordinates of the 24 rMD-refined structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratories (Bernstein et al., 1977); these data are also available directly from the authors, as are the NMR assignments of the recombinant P43G (Cd2+ )1-calbindin D9k.

acquisition period and 96 scans collected for each t1 point. A 1H-15N HSQC-TOCSY spectrum was recorded with a mixing time of 32 ms and 150 points in t1 ; other parameters were identical to those for the HSQC-NOESY spectra. Data processing and analysis The spectra were processed and evaluated using Felix 2.05 and 2.1 (Biosym Technologies), running on Sun Sparc 2 and Silicon Graphics Iris 4D workstations. The NOESY spectra were processed with a mild Lorentzian-Gaussian window function applied to the FIDs. The interferograms were extended from 500 to 625 points using the HSVD linear-prediction algorithm (Barkhuijsen et al., 1987), followed by multiplication with a skewed sine-bell window. Third order polynomial baseline correction was applied in v2 . The final size of the processed spectrum was 4096 by 2048 points, yielding resolutions of 1.5 and 3 Hz in v2 and v1 , respectively. COSY, COSY-35 and TOCSY spectra utilized for measuring coupling constants were processed to a final resolution of 0.4 Hz in v2 . Experimental constraints Previous work on both the apo and (Ca2+ )2 states of calbindin D9k has shown that for quantitative evaluation of NOESY cross-peaks, a mixing time of 60 ms is optimal in that it affords a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio and yet shows only minor spin-diffusion contributions (Akke et al., 1991b; Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993). Therefore, the present study did not monitor the build-up of NOE intensity over a range of mixing times, but simply utilized two spectra with mixing times of 60 and 150 ms for the evaluation of distance constraints. The conversion of NOESY cross-peak volumes into distance constraints was based on calibration of the dNN , daN , dNN (i, i + 2), daN (i, i + 2), daN (i, i + 3), dab (i, i + 3) and daN (i, i + 4) connectivities against the corresponding distances expected for regular secondary structure elements (Billeter et al., 1982; Wuthrich et al., ¨ 1984). Analysis of the resulting volume-versus-connectivity profile provided well defined limits for the upper distances. The volume-to-distance conversion was subsequently verified by comparing fixed distances in aromatic rings with the corresponding NOESY volumes. Five categories of upper bound distances were used for the ° 60 ms 1H NOESY spectrum: 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5 and 6.0 A. The upper bounds for the 150 ms 1H NOESY spectrum were: ° 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0 and 7.0 A; here, the two longest upper bounds were increased to account conservatively for possible spin diffusion effects. During the initial stages of the structure calculations, distance constraints from the 1 H-15N HSQC-NOESY spectra were utilized for connectivities that were ambiguous in the 1H NOESY spectra, and ° the upper bounds were categorized as: 3.2, 3.7 and 5.0 A; following back-calculations, these constraints were normalized in the 1 H NOESY spectra. Cross-peak volumes between two groups of spins a and b were divided by a factor (Na Nb ), where Ni refers to the number of protons with degenerate chemical shift in group i (Yip, 1990). For methyl protons, the distance constraints were increased ° further by 0.5 A (Tropp 1980; Koning et al., 1990). All geminal and vicinal connectivities, as well as sequential and intra-residue distance constraints that were redundant with elementary, sterically imposed constraints (Wuthrich ¨ et al., 1983), were filtered out prior to the structure calculations. Hydrogen bond constraints were not included during any stage of the calculations. Furthermore, neither the cadmium ion nor coordination constraints on the protein ligands were included in the

structure calculations, since no such information was available from experiment. Dihedral angle constraints were obtained from the scalar coupling constants.3JHNa coupling constants were evaluated form the COSY spectrum using the method of Kim & Prestegard (1989). 3Jab coupling constants were measured from the peak-to-peak separation due to the passive coupling in the COSY-35 spectrum as described by Griesinger et al. (1987). 3JNb coupling constants were measured from the separation due to the passive coupling between the Hb and 15N nuclei in the 1H TOCSY spectrum acquired on the 15N-labeled sample, as described by Montelione et al., (1989). In addition, if reliable measurements in the COSY-35 spectrum could not be attained due to spectral overlap, qualitative information on the 3Jab coupling constants were obtained from the relative intensities of the 15N­Hb cross-peaks in the HSQC­TOCSY spectrum acquired with a 32 ms mixing time (Clore et al., 1991). The 3JHNa coupling constants were converted into f dihedral angle constraints, according to criteria based on the Karplus-type relations (Karplus, 1959; Pardi et al., 1984): for values of 3JHNa less than 5.5 Hz, the constraint was set to -90° < f < -40°, and for values larger than 8 Hz, the constraint was -160° < f < -80°. x1 dihedral angle constraints and stereo-specific assignments were included if the 3Jab coupling constants did not indicate that the side-chains were conformationally averaged between rotamers. The criteria used were that both 3Jab coupling constants should be smaller than 5 Hz, or differ by at least 5 Hz. For those cases where the 3Jab and 3JNb coupling constants can both be measured for both diastereotopic Hb methylene protons, information on the x1 dihedral angle is directly available and stereo-specific assignments can be made without additional information on the intra-residual NOEs (Montelione et al., 1989). For cases where both the 3 Jab and 3JNb coupling constants cannot be measured, stereo-specific assignments and x1 constraints can potentially be obtained from the coupling constant data available in conjunction with intra-residual dNb NOE intensities (Hyberts et al., 1987). The x1 dihedral angle constraints were set to the classical rotamers, i.e. +60°, +180° or -60°, with a range of 260°. In several cases, the available data were only sufficient to exclude one rotamer, hence, the range for the corresponding constraint was set to 2120°. For some of these cases, stereo-specific assignments and x1 constraints of 260° could be introduced following initial structure calculations, based on the result that the same rotamer was present in all structures of the then-current ensemble (40 to 60 structures at intermediate stages). In principle, stereo-specific assignments should be attainable even if the side-chain conformation is averaged between different rotamers, as long as the populations of the different rotameric conformations are not equal (Pachler, 1963); conversely, the relative populations of the different rotamers can also be calculated. However, one might anticipate the stereo-specific assignments of diastereotopic Hb methylene protons showing signs of conformational averaging increase the risk of introducing unduly restrictive NOE constraints due to the presence of mutually exclusive NOE patterns from different rotamers (vide infra). Therefore, no stereo-specific assignments were introduced for cases where the coupling constants reporting on the x1 dihedral angle indicated conformational averaging. Stereo-specific assignments of the valine methyl groups were obtained using the method described by Zuiderweg et al., (1985), while observing the IUPAC-IUB nomenclature

assignments, even in heavily overlapped regions of the spectrum. Knowledge of the mean value and the standard deviation of the theoretical NOEs makes it straightforward to assess the reliability of the individual back-calculated intensities. These data are essential for assigning cross-peaks on the basis of the back-calculated data alone. A critical minimum criterion utilized was that the mean back-calculated NOE had an intensity larger than two times the standard deviation (i.e. assuming normal distributions of the intensities, the assignments were accepted at the 95% confidence level). The back-calculations were employed at a rather late stage in the structure calculations, with only a single iteration through the computational protocol required to bring the structures to the current level of refinement.

rules (IUPAC-IUB, 1970). Stereo-specific assignments of proline Hb and side-chain amide protons were directly made based on the observations that the proline Hb3 is always closer to the Ha, and the Hd2/e2 is always closer to the Hb/g methylene protons (Kline et al., 1988). Structure calculations The structures were initially generated using the distance geometry program DISGEO (Havel & Wuthrich, ¨ 1984), with the standard pseudoatom representation (Wuthrich et al., 1983) for non-stereospecifically assigned ¨ methylene protons and methyl groups. Corrections to the experimental upper bounds were applied as described previously (Akke et al., 1991b). The lower distance bound was taken to be the sum of the van der Waals' radii, except that the lower bound for all distances between backbone amide and backbone carbonyl groups was reduced from ° ° 2.2 A to 1.8 A in order to allow all possible backbone hydrogen bond pairs to form during the DG calculations. The DG structure calculation protocol was essentially identical to that described previously (Akke et al., 1992), except that the present work employed refinement in four-dimensional space (Crippen, 1982). The DISGEO calculations utilized a version of the program encoded in the C programming language (M. Christiansen, unpublished). The final set of DG calculations consisted of 80 trial embeds, out of which 76 (95%) were successful. The resulting DG structures were subjected to restrained energy minimization and restrained molecular dynamics, using the SANDER module of AMBER 4.0 (Pearlman et al., 1991a,b), in order to sample more completely the conformational space consistent with the input constraints, as well as refine the geometry and energies of these structures. The structure refinement protocol employed in our laboratory has been described in detail (Akke et al., 1992; Ko ¨rdel et al., 1993). Constraints involving nonstereospecifically assigned diastereotopic protons were treated with r-6 -1/6 averaging (Clore et al., 1986) of the individual upper bounds. In addition, the largest upper bound of the two individual constraints was applied to both diastereotopic protons if the coupling constants related to the x1 dihedral angel did not indicate rotameric averaging. This selection criterion was applied because trial structure calculations, which included this additional upper bound universally, showed that those residues showing signs of averaging between rotamers typically ended up with consistent distance constraint violations of ° 00.15 A for intra-residual or sequential connectivities. The DISGEO and AMBER calculations were run on either a cluster of Hewlett-Packard 735 nodes or a Cray YMP. Ensemble averaged back-calculations of NOE intensities Theoretical NOE intensities were back-calculated from refined structures using CORMA (Keeper & James, 1984; Borgias et al., 1987, 1989), and the agreement with the experimental NOE intensities were checked as described elsewhere (Skelton et al., 1995). In short, the theoretical intensities were calculated for each structure in the ensemble, and the mean and standard deviation of the theoretical NOE intensities were evaluated for each cross-peak; this is in contrast to the method proposed by Bonvin et al. (1993), which uses an average relaxation matrix based on the ensemble of structures. The back-calculation method provides a very efficient means of checking for misassignments, as well as introducing new

Stereo-specific assignments based on back-calculated NOE intensities Stereo-specific assignments of diastereotopic groups of protons were made by comparing the experimental and back-calculated cross-peak intensities between each of the two resonances of the diastereotopic groups and a third uniquely assigned resonance. A stereo-specific assignment was accepted if the ensemble-averaged back-calculated NOE intensities identified only one of the two possible stereo-specific assignments, using the criterion that the intensities should differ by more than 2 standard deviations. This procedure can be applied to a reduced set of intra-residue NOE intensities if all of the corresponding experimental cross-peaks are well resolved. For example, in the case of a leucine side-chain, the pattern of intensities for the two pairs of intra-residue Hb­Hd cross-peaks can be compared to the back-calculated intensities, which directly identify the correct stereo-specific assignments of both the Hb methylene and the Hd methyl protons, as well as the x2 dihedral angle. The intra-residue-based assignment procedure was given higher priority than that based on all cross-peaks, since it is affected only by the local side-chain definition. Inclusion of long-range interactions drastically affects the statistical significance of the results if the third unique proton is poorly defined. Again, stereo-specific assignments were not made for those side-chains with scalar coupling constants showing evidence of averaging between rotamers.

Analysis of the structures In order to ascertain that the ensemble of structures sufficiently samples the available conformational space consistent with the experimental constraints, the average RMSD versus the average coordinates was monitored for each residue as a function of the number of structures included in the ensemble, added in order of increasing constraint energy. This procedure builds upon guidelines given by Wagner et al. (1992), but provides more in-depth information by allowing different parts of the molecule to be monitored individually. It allows a direct determination of the number of structures that need to be included in the ensemble to achieve adequate sampling of all regions of the molecule. The minimum number of structures that need to be included for the most poorly defined regions is equal to the number needed for the entire molecule. The three-dimensional plot of the average RMSD versus the average coordinates as a function of residue numbers reaches a plateau at about 20 structures for the most poorly defined region of the molecule, whereas the corresponding

118
number is roughly five for the most well defined regions (data not shown). A related method for gauging the sampling is given by the maximum constraint energy in the ensemble as a function of the number of structures included in the ensemble, again added in order of increasing constraint energy (Widmer et al., 1993). This plot readily allows identification of different sub-families within the ensemble of structures, and is used as a selection criterion for the representative ensemble. Using this criterion, the first 33 structures were identified as a representative ensemble (data not shown). Visual inspection of these 33 structures identified a subset of structures as being out-of-family in one or more regions of the molecule. Subsequent analysis of the dihedral- and van der Waals' AMBER energy terms on a per residue basis revealed that these structures have energy terms larger than twice the standard deviation from the mean value in these localized regions; apparently, these aberrant structures have been trapped in local energy minima during the ``cooling'' step of the rMD annealing cycle. The final ensemble of 24 structures fulfills all of the criteria mentioned above for sufficient sampling of conformational space to adequately represent the molecule. For RMSD comparison of structures, the structure with the lowest constraint energy was chosen as a reference, and all others were superimposed on this. Prior to the superposition of structures for RMSD comparisons, the atom names of symmetry-related pairs of atoms (Cd1/Cd2 and Ce1/Ce2 of Y and F; Oe1/Oe2 of E: Od1/Od2 of D) were adjusted to conform with the IUPAC-IUB nomenclature (IUPAC-IUB, 1970), using the computer program ROTFIX (G. Gippert, unpublished). Dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds and energy terms were analyzed using the ANALYSIS module of AMBER 4.0. Hydrogen bonds were identified using the criteria that the O(acceptor)­H(donor) ° distance is less that 2.5 A, and the O(acceptor)­H­ O(donor) angle is larger than 135°. The superimposed structures were visually inspected using InsightII 2.3 (Biosym Technologies) running on Silicon Graphics workstations. The ensemble averaged distance difference matrix In order to compare ensembles of structures, and evaluate where the structural changes occur, we calculate the ensemble averaged distance difference matrix (DDM), the elements of which are given by:
(A) (B) (A) (B) Ddij = (MN)-1 s s (dij,p - dij,q ) = dij - dij p=1 q=1 M N

Solution Structure of (Cd 2+)1-calbindin D9k
where s(Ddij ) is the standard deviation of the distance difference between atoms i and j in the two ensembles, and (A) s2(dij ) is the variance of the distance between atoms i and j in ensemble A. For practical purposes, only a subset of the interatomic distances are evaluated here. The DDM for the Ca­Ca distances was plotted using Mathematica (Wolfram Research), and the corresponding vectors representing the distance differences were visualized on the structures using GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). The DDM for comparison of two individual structures has been presented (Nishikawa et al., 1972).
