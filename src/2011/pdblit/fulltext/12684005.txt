In phospholipase A2and ribonuclease T,, no tyrosine-tryptophan energy transfer was found. This can be due first to the tyrosine high hypochromism in these proteins and second to the very low efficiency of energy transfer when the interchromophore distances are about 10 A.

1. Introduction One of the main problems concerning the photophysics of proteins remains the efficiency of the energy transfer from tyrosine to tryptophan residues. The resonance model proposed by Forster [ I] predicts that this process should be effective since the protein sizes are in fact comparable to the critical distance R. of 1 O-1 8, a tyrosine-tryptophan 8 for pair [ 21. However, the experimental data about this question are very contradictory. In an early paper by Teale [ 31, the energy transfer process in proteins was not found. However, in adrenocorticotropin, its existence from Tyr-2 and Tyr-23 to Trp-9 has been suggested [ 41. In a further work [ 5 1, using comparison of the fluorescent quantum yields at 280 and 295 nm excitation, efficiencies of tyrosine-tryptophan energy transfer of 100, 50, 80 and 45W for trypsin, papain, pepsin and albumin respectively, were reported. Later, Saito and co-workers [6] concluded that the efficiency of the energy transfer in other proteins was 17-69%. However, for the above-mentioned proteins, the efficiency was lower than previously reported. In trypsin for instance, the efficiency was only 29 f 7%. In another report [ 71, no energy transfer in trypsin was observed. Further, an effi' To whom correspondence should be addressed. 0301-0104/93/j

ciency of energy transfer of 27% was found in trypsin, but 0% in lysozyme, chymotrypsin and chymotrypsinogen [ 8 1. Contrary to the prediction of the resonance model, which predicts 50°h efficiency for Tyr108 and Trp-48 in azurin [ 91, no energy transfer was observed in this protein [lo]. In simple oligopeptides, containing Trp, Tyr, Ala and Gly, only a qualitative relation between theory and experimental transfer efficiency was found [ I 11. A few causes of such contradictions can be underlined. Some authors calculate the fluorescent quantum yields of proteins at 280 and 295 nm as excitation wavelength. However, this method does not take into account the polarization of the excitation light by the monochromator [ 21. This leads to erroneous quantum yield determinations [ 121. Further, some authors used excitation slits broader than 1 nm. It is incorrect for 295 nm excitation, where the absorption curve is very abrupt. In such conditions we are faced with three experimental problems. First, actual excitation at wavelength shorter than 295 nm is occurring. Second, a nonlinear dependence of the fluorescence intensity from optical density takes place. Third, it is not correct to use the absorption spectra which are usually recorded with narrow slits for computation of quantum yields. Finally, some authors have hypothesized additivity of the extinction coefficients of chromophores in proteins. However, it is

well known that the optical densities of native and denaturated proteins are not identical. The main reason for this fact may be the hypochromic effect: the extinction coefficient in helix is usually less than in random coil [ 131. Thus, absorption and excitation additivities cannot be taken as a general rule in native proteins. In this work we have checked bovine and porcine pancreatic phospholipase A* ( PLA2) and ribonuclease T, from Aspergillus oryzae ( RNase Ti ) , which are single-tryptophan containing proteins of small size and of rigid structure. Some tyrosine-tryptophan distances in PLA2 and RNase Ti are very short [ 1416 1. For RNase T ,, effective energy transfer to Trp59 is a commonly accepted point of view [ 15,17- 18 1.

2. Materials and methods Ribonuclease T, from Aspergillus oryzae, grade V, in 3.2 M ammonium sulfate (Sigma) was dialyzed twice against acetic buffer, pH 5.8. Bovine and porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 were supplied by Dr. H.M. Verheij (University of Utrecht, The Netherlands) and diluted in 100 mM acetic buffer, pH 5.8. N-acetyl-tryptophanamide (K&K) and Ltryptophan (Sigma) were dissolved in the same buffer. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Zeiss M-40 and Cary 2200 spectrophotometers using 1 cm quartz cuvettes. Excitation and emission spectra (uncorrected) were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer MPF-44B and on modified SLM-8000 spectrofluorimeter. For SLM-8000, the spectra were recorded with correction for the polarizing effect of monochromators and were smoothed using a Macintosh SE computer. The data on distances were taken from the published tridimensional structures of the proteins deposited in the Protein Data Bank [ 19,201 using the graphic program Manosk [ 2 11.

tion and fluorescent properties are very similar to that of NATA or Trp in water. Bovine PLA2 has seven tyrosines. The tyrosine-tryptophan distances in this protein are listed in table 1. The Forster critical distance for the tyrosine-tryptophan pair is lo- 18 8, [ 2,22 1. Therefore, an efficiency of about 100% can be expected for the energy transfer from Tyr-75 and Tyr-73 and of about 5OW from Tyr-69 and Tyr-52 to Trp-3. The FSrster critical distances for tyrosinetyrosine homo-transfer in proteins are estimated to be 6.6-8.7 A [ 221. In PLA2, four tyrosines are very close to each other (table 1). About 100% effective homo-transfer can be expected in this "group". Finally, a 1OOI effective transfer of excitation from these four tyrosines to Trp-3 must be expected. If the energy transfer from tyrosines to tryptophanyl is effective, an intense tyrosine band in the protein excitation spectrum should be observed. However, no tyrosine band in the excitation spectrum of bovine PLAz is found (fig. 1). Excitation spectra of PLA2 and NATA, recorded using PerkinElmer MPF-44B at the maximum of tryptophanyl emission where Tyr does not emit, coincide. Therefore, the efficiency of energy transfer is negligible. The first possibility to explain this very low efficiency can be that Tyr-52, Tyr-69, Tyr-73, Tyr-75 are strongly quenched by some neighbouring groups. According to X-ray analysis of bovine PLA2, only Tyr73 is in contact with the nitrogen of aspartic acid which is close to the phenol OH-group within a van der Waals radius less than 2.5 A.

The second possibility is that the Fijrster dipoledipole model is not applicable when distances are about the chromophore sizes [ 23 1. However, at such short distances, the efficiency may be even higher than predicted by the Fiirster theory because quadrupole and exchange interactions also take place. The third possibility is that the tyrosine absorption band in PLA2 is very small ( hypochromic effect ) . The absorption maximum of tyrosine lies at 275 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1250 M-' cm-' [ 2,221, 4.5 times less than that of tryptophan. In PLA2 at 275 nm, the global extinction coefficient for seven tyrosines must be about 8750 M-i cm-`, 1.6 times more than that for 1 tryptophanyl. Therefore, the main part of the protein UV absorbance at 275 nm must belong to the tyrosines. However, if we compare the absorption spectra of PLA2 with that of NATA or GTrp (fig. 2)) we can conclude that a strong hypochromism in the protein is occurring. The hypochromic value (H) can be calculated from
H=

where k(Tyr) and k(Trp) are the extinction coefftcients of free tyrosine and tryptophan, n and m are the number of tyrosine and tryptophan molecules equimolar to their content in the protein, k(prot) is the global extinction coefficient of the chromophores in the protein. The vibronic structure of excitation spectrum of

bovine PLA2 coincides with that of NATA (fig. 1). Consequently, the vibronic structure of tryptophanyl absorption spectrum in PLAz is the same as the one for NATA. Thus, the hypochromic effect takes place for tyrosines preferentially. At neutral pH, the extinction coefficient of tyrosine in water solution at 295 nm is 34 M-i cm-i. For seven tyrosines of bovine PLAz, their total extinction coefficient at 295 nm must be about 238 M-l cm-i. At this wavelength, the extinction coefficient of tryptophan is 1290 M-i cm-`. Therefore, in PLAl the absorbance at 295 nm is due to the tryptophanyl mainly, but a small contribution of tyrosines could also be present. When the absorption spectra of Trp and PLAz were normalized at 295 nm, a correction for a small part of tyrosine absorption (equal to 15.6% from common absorption) was introduced. Normalization was performed at 295 nm, but not at 300 nm, since the error for spectrophotometric measurement at 300 nm is too high. The extinction coefficient of Trp at 275 nm is about 5400 M- * cm-`. Therefore, as seen in fig. 2, the value Qprot) of bovine PLAz at the same wavelength is about 9150 M-r cm-`. Theoretically at 275 nm, k(Tyr)n+k(Trp)m = 1250x7+5400x1 = 14150 M - ' cm - ' . Thus, H is 35Oh. The question then arises of how such a large hypochromic effect can be explained. In principle, three kinds of hypochromism are possible: (a) Coulombic hypochromism due to strong interactions of chromophores with polar groups of the

234

protein, (b) stacking hypochromism due to strong mutual chromophore interactions [ 131 and (c) screening hypochromism as a result of the mutual screen of chromophores from light when they are oriented in parallel at a distance less than the absorption wavelength [ 241. In this last case, by contrast to the second one, no new absorption band appears. According to X-ray analysis of bovine PLA2, the OH-group of Tyr-73 is in contact with nitrogen of aspat-tic acid within a van der Waals radius of less than 2.5 A. Besides, the OH group of Tyr-28 is in contact with the oxygen atom of glycine. The first contact can lead to some change in absorption, but not the second. No strong interaction for any other tyrosines in bovine PLA2 are present. Therefore, Coulombic hypochromism is negligible. In PLA*, a few tyrosines are very close to each other (table 1) , but "stacking" is absent. Only Tyr- 111 and Tyr-25 are in "stacking" position but this corresponds to not more than x 5% change in extinction coefftcient for this pair. Consequently, significant stacking hypochromism of tyrosines is impossible. In fact, we do not see any additional bands in the edge of the absorption spectrum of PLA2. The difference spectrum between bovine PLAl and Trp (fig. 2) is very similar to the normal tyrosine absorbance. This means that no stacking hypochromism is occurring. The same result is obtained with NATA instead of Trp. When chromophores are located at distances less than the absorption wavelength and when their dipole moments are parallel, high screening hypochromism takes place [ 241. In this case the incident light does not reach the second chromophore because the first one is "impermeable" for photons of coincident electric vector polarization. X-ray analysis shows that Tyr-1 11, Tyr-25 and Tyr-75 are almost parallel to each other as well as Tyr-28 and Tyr-69. For Tyr- 111, Tyr-25 and Tyr-75, the extinction coefficient must be decreased by three times; for Tyr-28 and Tyr-69 it must be decreased by about one half. Therefore, the total screening hypochromism value for the seven tyrosines of bovine PLAZ may reach 43%. The experimental data lead to H= 35% (fig. 2), in reasonable agreement with the calculation. The assumption about screening mechanism of hypochromic effect in PLAz needs additional experiments to be further confirmed. Porcine PLA2 has eight tyrosine residues, one more

than bovine PLA2. Light absorption at 245-285 nm of porcine PLA2 is slightly higher than that of the bovine protein (fig. 2 ), but not in proportion with this additional tyrosine residue. Hypochromism of the tyrosine absorbance is observed. In porcine PLA2 we got the same absence of energy transfer as for bovine PLA:! (not shown). 3.2. Ribonuclease Tl According to X-ray analysis, RNase T, contains nine tyrosines. The tyrosine-tryptophan distances in RNase T, are given in table 2. The energy transfer efficiency from Tyr-68 and Tyr-38 to Trp-59 can be expected to be about 100%. For the other tyrosines, the efftciency will be about 50%. Seven tyrosine "pairs" in close contact to each other are present (table 2). About 50-100% effective homo-transfer can be expected for six pairs. The tyrosin-tryptophan energy transfer is not observed in this protein (fig. 3 ). The excitation spectra were recorded with correction for the polarizing effect of the monochromators on SLM 8000, they were smoothed and normalized at 300 nm, where tyrosines have no absorption. The intensity of the NATA band is even higher than that of the protein and the

1250x9+5400x difference in the excitation spectra may be due to a more hydrophobic microenvironment of tryptophanyl in RNase Tr than that for NATA in water solution, according to its buried location in the protein. It displays a narrow fluorescence band with a maximum at 320 nm and with a quantum yield of about 0.3 [ 15- 18 1. NATA in water has maximum at 350 nm and a quantum yield of 0.14 f 2]_ For the nine tyrosines of RNase T, the global extinction coeflficient at 275 nm must be about 11250 M-' cm-`, twice as high as for the single tryptophanyl. Therefore, the main part of the protein UV absorbance at 275 nm must belong to the tyrosines. The extinction coefficient of nine tyrosines at 295 nm must be about 306 M- ' cm-i. The absorbance at 295 nm must be due to both t~ptophanyl and tyrosines (about 8 1.6% and 18.4%, respectively). Upon normalization of the absorption spectra of Trp and RNase T1 at 295 nm, a correction for the tyrosine contribution of absorption was introduced. The normalization was performed at 295 nm, but not at 300 nm, because the error for spectrophotometric measurements at 300 nm is too high (very low optical density). When the absorption spectra of RNase Tl and of NATA or Trp are compared (fig. 4), it can be concluded that a strong hypochromism in the protein takes place. The extinction coefficient of Trp at 275 nm is 5400 M-i cm-`. Therefore, as seen from fig. 4, the value k(prot) of RNase T, at 275 nm is about 8500 M-' cm-' only. Theoretically, k(Tyr)n+k(Trp)m=

Thus,

H=49Oh. A similar result was obtained with NATA

instead of Trp. According to X-ray analysis, in the crystal structure no tyrosines are in contact with protein polar groups within a van der Waals radius of 2.5 A. Tyr45 and Tyr-24 are surrounded by water, Tyr-4 is in contact with few water molecules. However, molecular dynamics calculations suggest that, in solution, some tyrosines of this protein can take part in hydrogen bond formation. Tyr-45 can form hydrogen bonds with Tyr-42 and Glu-58. Tyr-42 can form hydrogen bonds also with Glu-46 whereas Tyr-I 1 can form a hydrogen bond with Asp-76 ] 25 1. No stronger interactions are likely to be present. Therefore, it is realistic to conclude that Coulombic h~ochromism is negligible. Some tyrosines are in close pairs in this protein (table 2). For these tyrosines the phenol rings are not parallel. Therefore, stacking interactions are absent. Consequently, stacking hypochromism of tyrosines is impossible. In fact, no additional bands in the edge of the absorption spectrum of the protein can be seen (fig. 4). On the other hand, some tyrosines situated at long distance are approximately parallel. X-ray analysis shows that it is the case for Tyr-1 1 and Tyr-56, for Tyr-24 and Tyr-4, for Tyr-57 and Tyr-68 and also for Tyr-38 and Tyr-42. For these tyrosines the global extinction coefficient must be decreased to one half. Only Tyr-45 must retain an unchanged extinction coefficient. Therefore, the screening hypochromism

value for tyrosines of RNase Ti may reach 44%. In experimental data (fig. 4)) H= 49% which is in a good consent with the calculated value. The suggestion about the screening mechanism of hypochromic effect in RNase T, needs further experiments.
