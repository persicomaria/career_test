1. Introduction Until recently direct data on the presence of ribosomal protein S1 in Thermus thermophilus ribosomes have been absent. Moreover, its existence was repeatedly called in question [1,2]. By the end of 2001, the protein was claimed to be present in T. thermophilus ribosomes, but the results presented did not allow identifying it among proteins of the ribosomal 30S subunit [3]. At the same time, there are a large number of reports on the ribosomal protein S1 from Escherichia coli. Protein S1 from E. coli is the largest ribosomal protein with a molecular mass of 61 kDa and a length of 557 amino acid residues. The protein is weakly retained within the 30S ribosomal subunit. Using immunoelectron microscopy, cryoelectron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis, protein S1 was located between the head of the 30S ribosomal subunit and its side bulge [4^6]. Functionally, protein S1 is subdivided into two domains. The N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1^195) seems to be responsible mainly for protein^protein interactions and binds to the ribosomal subunit. The C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 196^557) is responsible for RNA^protein

The nucleotide sequence for Thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein S1 has been deposited to EMBL data bank under accession number AJ458461.

interactions and capable of binding to mRNA [7]. Protein S1 plays an important role in initiation of translation and is required for the e/cient in vivo translation of most natural mRNAs in E. coli [7,8]. Like some other ribosomal proteins, protein S1 regulates its own synthesis as an autogenous repressor [7^11]. Protein S1 binds to tmRNA (an RNA molecule that combines the properties of a transfer and a messenger RNA) and, promoting its interaction with the 70S ribosome, participates in the trans-translation [2,12]. Some extraribosomal functions of the protein are also known. It is included in the QL phage replicase as one of its four subunits and is necessary for the replication of the plus strand of QL RNA [13,14]. Protein S1 is also required for the function of the RNA-speci¢c phage T4 endonuclease [15]. The most speci¢c feature of the primary structure of protein S1 is the presence of six homologous amino acid repeats of about 70 amino acids long [7,16]. This repeat was ¢rst identi¢ed in the E. coli protein S1 and named S1 RNA-binding motif or S1 domain [7,17]. The S1 motif has been found in some other RNA-binding proteins. One copy of the S1 motif is present in translation initiation factor IF1 of bacteria and chloroplasts, as well as in bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase. Yeast protein S57596, whose function is not yet known, contains 12 copies of the S1 domain. Proteins containing nine to 12 copies of this domain have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans [17]. There is uncertainty as to the conformational properties of protein S1. When isolated from the ribosomes of E. coli, the protein seems to have no compact conformation. The results of small-angle X-ray scattering analysis have demonstrated that E. coli protein S1 in solution has a highly asymmetric shape, its length (23 nm) being comparable with the dimension of the ribosome [7]. At the same time, the maximal dimension of the full QL replicase, which contains protein S1 as a subunit, is only 10 nm [18]. This indicates that protein S1 acquires a compact conformation within the QL replicase. It can be assumed that being within the ribosomal subunit protein S1 is also more compact than in solution [18]. This important ribosomal protein has been found neither in T. thermophilus, nor in some other microorganisms. It was proposed that other proteins could play the role of protein S1 in such microorganisms [1,2]. In this paper direct evidence for the presence of protein S1 in T. thermophilus ribosomes is given.

89 cutting it with NcoI and EcoRI it was cloned into vector pET21d in these sites. The DNA fragments were ligated by the T4 DNA ligase, and the recombinant plasmid called pET21d-tthS1, containing the protein S1 gene under the T7 promoter, was used for transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. For expression of the protein gene, the BL21(DE3)/pET21d-tthS1 cells were grown in the LB medium containing 100 Wg/ml ampicillin at 37C to an A600 = 0.8^1.0. The synthesis of T. thermophilus ribosomal protein S1 was induced by the addition of IPTG to a concentration of 1 mM, and cell growth was continued for 3 h under the same conditions. The level of protein S1 synthesis in the obtained clones was analyzed using SDS^PAGE according to Laemmli [28]. The protein content in the inclusion bodies was determined as described [29]. 2.6. Isolation and puri¢cation of the recombinant protein S1 Cells obtained from 1 l culture (3 g) were suspended in 40 ml of 100 mM Tris^HCl bu¡er pH 8.0, containing 100 mM MgCl2 , 800 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride, and disrupted by sonication. After removal of cell debris the supernatant was heated at 65C for 20 min, and the denatured E. coli proteins were removed by centrifugation (12 000Ug, 30 min) [30]. The supernatant was concentrated, dialyzed against 50 mM Tris^HCl bu¡er pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA, and loaded on 40 ml DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated against the same bu¡er. After washing, the recombinant protein was eluted with a linear 2U200 ml gradient of 0^ 0.2 M NaCl in the same bu¡er. The elution rate was 50 ml/h with a fraction volume of 10 ml. The gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS^PAGE and those containing the pure protein were pooled. The protein was precipitated with 2 M ammonium sulfate. The protein concentration was determined by the standard Bradford method [31].

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials, database and programs All chemicals were from Sigma (USA) and Serva (Germany). Restriction enzymes EcoRI and NcoI, and T4 DNA ligase were from Promega (USA), Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (USA). DEAE-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech (Sweden). In this work the pET21d vector and E. coli strains XL1-Blue and BL21(DE3) were used. The amino acid sequence of the E. coli protein S1 was taken from the SwissProt Data Bank (http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/, accession number P02349). The `Gene Runner' program (Hastings Software) was used to analyze the nucleotide sequences. Alignment of the protein sequences was done with the `Clustal W' program [19]. 2.2. Preparation of ribosomes, ribosomal subunits and total ribosomal protein The growth of T. thermophilus HB8 cells, puri¢cation of ribosomes and their separation into subunits were done as described earlier [20]. E. coli MRE-600 ribosomes were prepared according to [21] and separated into subunits as described in [22]. The total preparation of ribosomal proteins of the 30S ribosomal subunit was obtained using the standard procedure of acetic acid extraction of proteins [23] in the presence of 100 mM MgCl2 at 4C overnight. 2.3. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the 30S ribosomal proteins To separate individual ribosomal proteins, the two-dimensional electrophoresis method according to Agafonov et al. [24] with minor modi¢cations was used. The protein samples were not treated with iodoacetamide prior to the electrophoretic separation. In the second dimension, a non-gradient separating gel was used (16.5% T, 6% C). 2.4. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the protein was performed in an automatic gas phase sequencer (Applied BioSystems model 447) equipped with HPLC system 120A from the same manufacturer. Prior to this, the protein was transferred onto Immobilon-Psq transfer membrane according to Matsudaira [25] in transfer bu¡er containing 10 mM Na3 BO3 (pH 11) and 0.02% (v/v) L-mercaptoethanol. 2.5. Cloning and overexpression The Studier system [26] including the host strain E. coli BL21(DE3) and vector pET21d was used. Chromosomal DNA from T. thermophilus was isolated by a modi¢ed Marmur procedure [27] and used as a template for PCR ampli¢cation of the protein S1 gene. To perform cloning, sites of NcoI and EcoRI (underlined) were introduced into the oligonucleotide primers: N-terminus: 5P-GGCGCCATGGAAGACAAGGCGACCC-3P; C-terminus: 5P-GGAAGAATTCTTAGCCCCGGCTCTTCTCCTC-3P. After puri¢cation of the PCR product in a melting agarose gel and

3. Results and discussion The analysis of the protein composition of ribosomes and their subunits is usually done with two-dimensional electrophoresis according to Madjar et al. [32]. This method of electrophoresis, however, is not quite suitable for separation of relatively high molecular mass proteins, such as protein S1, in the second dimension. In order to analyze the protein composition of the 30S ribosomal subunit from T. thermophilus, we used a modi¢cation of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis recently developed by Agafonov et al. [24]. The main di¡erence from the standard Madjar two-dimensional electrophoresis of proteins is that the modi¢ed system of SDS^PAGE according to Schagger and von Jagow [33] is used in the « second dimension, instead of electrophoresis in 6 M urea and acid pH. The system allows separating the ribosomal

proteins in the second dimension in a wide range of molecular masses and correlating the results with those of SDS^PAGE. While performing electrophoresis of the proteins of T. thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunits in the new system, an additional spot of a relatively high molecular mass protein was detected. The comparison of the results of the electrophoretic separation of 30S subunit proteins from E. coli and T. thermophilus in this system has shown that the position of this spot corresponds to that of protein S1 from E. coli (Fig. 1). SDS^PAGE of proteins of ribosomes and ribosomal subunits from E. coli and T. thermophilus has demonstrated that this high molecular mass protein, similar to protein S1 from E. coli, is present in the 70S ribosome and the 30S subunit of T. thermophilus but is absent in the 50S subunit (Fig. 2). It should be noted that, according to SDS^PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis maps, the content of the S1-like protein in the samples of T. thermophilus ribosomes is typically lower than that of protein S1 in the standard preparations of E. coli ribosomes. This can be explained by the more drastic procedure used for the isolation of T. thermophilus ribosomes, as compared with that in the case of E. coli ribosomes. In order to identify the S1-like protein of T. thermophilus more accurately, we performed N-terminal amino acid analysis and determined 13 N-terminal amino acids. It turned out that the N-terminal sequence of this protein is not homologous to that of the E. coli protein S1. At the same time this amino acid sequence allowed us to identify the corresponding DNA sequence in the T. thermophilus genome that is under

investigation in the Georg-August-Universitat Gottingen. The « « analysis of the sequence has led to the detection of the open reading frame, i.e. the gene, encoding the polypeptide of 536 amino acid residues in length that contains six homologous amino acid repeats corresponding to the S1 motifs. In addition, a high homology of the deduced amino acid sequence of

time, the interaction of the protein S1 with the 30S subunit may contribute to its overall structure. Due to the interdomain localization of protein S1 on the 30S subunit [4^6] it can a¡ect the domain disposition in the functioning ribosome. Thus, the solution of the atomic structure of the ribosome seems to be incomplete without protein S1. Besides, the identi¢cation of T. thermophilus ribosomal protein S1 and its preparative production makes it possible to study the conformation of this protein in the isolated state. It is known that proteins of thermophilic organisms are more stable in solution than their homologs from mesophilic ones, this permitting the preservation of their native structure after isolation, their easier crystallization and the use of other physical approaches to their conformational analyses. There is high hope that the uncertainty about the folding state of ribosomal protein S1, both within the ribosome and in the isolated form, will be solved with the use of the T. thermophilus protein as an object of physical studies.

References this polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of the protein S1 from E. coli is observed (Fig. 3). Therefore, the protein found in the 30S ribosomal subunit of T. thermophilus can be de¢nitely identi¢ed as the ribosomal protein S1. For the purpose of preparative production of T. thermophilus protein S1, the gene of the thermophilic protein was ampli¢ed, cloned in expression vector pET21d under the promoter of T7 RNA polymerase and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The expression was performed as described in Section 2. According to the data from SDS^PAGE, the production of the recombinant protein in E. coli cells was about 20% of the total cellular protein (Fig. 4). The overproduced protein was in a soluble form. Heating of the cell extract at 65C for 20 min made it possible to remove the greater part of E. coli proteins as precipitates at this initial stage of isolation of the recombinant protein (Fig. 4). The high NaCl concentration at this stage of puri¢cation made it possible to avoid co-precipitation of the T. thermophilus protein S1 with E. coli proteins. The ¢nal puri¢cation of the protein was done with ion exchange DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The protein was eluted from the column at 0.13 M NaCl. According to SDS^PAGE analysis, the protein purity was higher than 95% (Fig. 4). The ¢nal yield of the recombinant protein was more than 3.5 mg from 1 g of the E. coli cell biomass. Recently the three-dimensional structure of bacterial ribosomes and their 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits has been determined with the use of X-ray crystallography [34^36]. A î high resolution (up to 2.4^3.0 A) has been achieved for such complex ribonucleoprotein complexes as the ribosome and its subunits. However, the largest and functionally important ribosomal protein S1 was absent in the atomic structure of the T. thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit [35], probably due to its loss during ribosome and subunit puri¢cation.
