Abstract The crystal structure of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) has been determined to 3.5,4, resolution. The icosahedral CVB3 panicles crystallize in the monoclinic space group, P21, ( a - - 574.6, b = 302.1, c--- 521.6A, /3--107.7 °) with two virions in the asymmetric unit giving 120-fold non-crystallographic redundancy. The crystals diffracted to 2.7 A resolution and the X-ray data set was 55% complete to 3.0,4, resolution. Systematically weak reflections and the self-rotation function established pseudo R32 symmetry with each particle sitting on a 32 special position. This constrained the orientation and position of each panicle in the monoclinic cell to near face-centered positions and allowed for a total of six possible monoclinic spacegroup settings. Correct interpretation of the highresolution (3.0-3.2~,) self-rotation function was instrumental in determining the deviations from R32 orientations of the virus particles in the unit cell. Accurate particle orientations permitted the correct assignment of the crystal space-group setting amongst the six ambiguous possibilities and for the correct determination of particle positions. Real-space electron-density averaging and phase refinement, using human rhinovius 14 (HRV14) as an initial phasing model, have been carried out to 3.5,~ resolution. The initial structural model has been built and refined to 3.5 ~, resolution using X-PLOR.

Introduction Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a member of the picornavirus family which consists of a large number of important human and animal pathogens. Picornavirus panicles are icosahedral, non-envelopoed, single-stranded RNA viruses of approximately 300 A in diameter. The capsid shell is arranged in a T - 1 (P = 3) lattice

(Caspar & Klug, 1962) containing 60 copies of each of the viral proteins VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. Here we report the crystallization, characterization and structure detemination of CVB3 to 3.5 ~, resolution. The analysis proved difficult due to pseudo R32 symmetry which places two independent virus particles in the monoclinic asymmetric unit resulting in a multi-parameter positional and orientational problem not including the choice of monoclinic space-group settings. However, as a consequence of the pseudo R32 symmetry, the 120fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was ver~' beneficial during phasing and averaging to 3.5A resolution. The large unit cell posed a number of computational difficulties and a considerable effort was put forth to adapt molecular-averaging programs, especially the averaging program, ENVELOPE (Rossmann et al., 1992), to parallel computers (Cornea-Hasegan et al., 1995). These parallel programs greatly aided in the CVB3 structure determination. The pseudo R32 packing of the CVB3 particles was rather unusual for virus crystals but not unique. Nodamura virus (NOV) also exhibited pseudo R32 symmetry and packed similarly to CVB3 in a monoclinic P2~ cell with two particles in the asymmetric unit (Zlotnick et al., 1993).While the cell dimensions and the P2 L space group were similar for CVB3 and NOV, the pseudo R32 symmetry for NOV was much less severe than that of CVB3. The less extensive pseudo symmetry was most evident based on the presence of the systematically weak pseduo R32 reflections at low resolution, the obvious splitting of the self-rotation function peaks at 3.5,4, resolution and the displacements of the particles from the special face-centered positions. Thus, analysis of the pseudo R32 rotation function and some of the analyses of the particle packing were developed in the course of the NOV structure determination (Zlotnick, Natarajan & Johnson, unpublished results). Exact R32 symmetry would have occurred if the icosahedral threefold and twofold axes were coincident with crystallographic R32 axes. In this case, the fivefold axes of particles on neighboring lattice points would align exactly, as occurs in southern bean mosaic virus (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1981). However, in the case of CVB3, there is a few degrees difference in the fivefold

COXSACKIEVIRUS B3 resuspended in 50mM MES buffer, pH6.0, with 0.75M NaC1 to obtain a final virus concentration of 5mgm1-1. Before setting up crystal trays, the virus solution was microcentrifuged for 5 min in an eppendorf tube four times to remove any potential nucleation sites that might promote crystal showers. CVB3 crystals (Fig. 1) were grown at room temperature using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. The sitting drop contained 10 ktl of 5 mg m1-1 virus in 50 mM MES buffer, pH6.0 with 0.75M NaC1 and the well contained l ml 2M (NH4)2SO 4. Small well formed crystals appeared in 2-3 d and continued growing for 1-2 weeks.

axes of abutting virions and in the case of NOV the difference is even greater. An investigation into why CVB3 and NOV pack as they do warrants further consideration.

Virus propagation, purification and crystallization
The strain of virus used for crystallographic studies was a myocarditic variant of CVB3 (CVB3-Gauntt or CVB3m) characterized by Trousdale, Paque & Gauntt (1977). This variant was obtained from Sterling-Winthrop Pharmaceutical Research Division. Virus was propagated in HeLa cells using a procedure similar to the propagation of HRV14 previously described by Rueckert & Pallansch (1981). CVB3, at a multiplicity of infection of ten plaque-forming units per cell, was allowed to attach to cells for 30 min at 294 K followed by a 6 h incubation at 307.5 K with agitation. The infected cells were then harvested and stored at 203 K. CVB3 was purified by a modified procedure (Mapoles, Krah & Crowell, 1985; Rueckert & Pallansch, 1981) and is described below. The virus was released from cells by three freeze-thawing cycles, homogenizing with a dounce homogenizer and adding detergent, NP-40, to 1% concentration. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10 000 rev min -1 (290 K) using a Beckman J2-21 centrifuge with an $517 rotor. MgC12 to 5mM, DNAse to 10mgm1-1 and sodium dodecyl sulfate 0.5% were added to the virus-containing supernatant and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 30min. 0.5mgm1-1 trypsin was added and the solution incubated at 310K for an additional 10min. EDTA (pH9.5) to 10mM was then added along with N-laurel sarcosine to 1% and the solution was centrifuged (12 000 rev min- 1) for 10 min at 290 K. The supernatant was then collected and centrifuged at 48 000 rev min -1 (290 K) for 2 h using a Beckman L7-55 ultracentrifuge with a 50.2Ti rotor through a 30% sucrose cushion in 100mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffer and layered onto a 10-40% potassium tartrate gradient and centrifuged using an SW41 rotor for 90min (36000revmin -l) at 290K. The virus bands were collected, diluted with 100mM phosphate buffer, pH7.2 and centrifuged (48 000revmin -1) for 90 min at 284 K. The pellets were then resuspended in 50 mM MES buffer, pH6.0, with 0.75M NaC1 and the purity was assessed by measuring the A26o/A28 o ratio (pure virus gave a ratio of 1.75) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Yields were calculated assuming an extinction coefficient of Ao.Wo = 7.7 cm -1. Yields were typically 1.0 to 2.0mg of 260 virus per 10 9 infected cells. The virus solution was centrifuged for 90 min using a 50Ti rotor (45000revmin -l) at 283K and the pellets were

Data collection and processing
CVB3 data were collected at the Comell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) using the F-1 station. The X-ray beam was collimated by a 0.3 mm collimator with additional upstream horizontal (30% intensity reduction) and vertical (10% intensity reduction) beam trimming to minimize beam divergence. The trimming of the beam was essential to obtain resolved high-order reflections on CVB3 films due to the large unit-cell axes. The 0.3 ° oscillation photographs of CVB3 crystals were collected using the 'American method' (Rossmann & Erickson, 1983) in which the crystals were placed into the X-ray beam in random orientations without aligning crystal axes relative to the X-ray camera axes. This minimized the overexposure of crystals to X-rays and maximized the number of exposures per crystal. Crystals

JODI K. MUCKELBAUER et al. of CVB3 diffracted well to 2.7,~ resolution. However, the presence of two large unit-cell parameters (> 500,~,) restricted data collection to 3.0.~ resolution. Oscillation photo~zraphs (0.3 °) at a crystal-to-film distance of 190 mm, collected on a 12.7 x 12.7 cm Kodak DEF X-ray film, proved to be optimal for obtaining well resolved reflections to 3.0,~ resolution (Fig. 2). Exposure times and number of exposures per crystal depended on the size of the crystal and the beam current. Typically, for a crystal 0.4 × 0.3 x 0.2 mm, three to six useful exposures could be obtained. Average exposure times were 60-90 s per film at a current of about 40 mA. The native data were collected in 1991 before the advent of image plates and prior to the high-intensity beam available on F-1 in 1994. The oscillation films were digitized on an Optronics drum scanner using 50 ~tm raster steps, indexed using osc-123 (Kim, 1989) and processed and post-ref'ined using the Purdue University suite of programs (Rossman, 1979; Rossmann, Leslie, Abdel-Meguid & Tsukihara, 1979). Films from three data trips (Chessl, Chess2 and Chess3) comprised the majority of the native data collected on CVB3. A number of good films (80) were chosen from the Chess l data to determine crystal cell dimensions and the space group. Cell dimensions obtained from osc-123 were on average a = 5 7 5 , b=300, c=520,~, t~=y=90, /~= 107 ° , which suggested a monoclinic space group. The R factors (defined in Table 1) for symmetry-related reflections were consistent with a 2/m Laue group verifying the monoclinic system. A reasonable VM of 2.6,~3 Da-] was calculated, assuming a molecular weight for CVB3 of 8.2 x 106Da and four virions in the unit cell (two per asymmetric unit). The 80 films were processed and scaled together using monoclinic 2/m Laue symmetry. By post-refining diffraction photographs taken at the F-1 station of HRV14 crystals, which have well ref'med cell dimensions (Amold & Rossmann, 1988), an accurate wavelength for the Chessl trip was determined to be 0.9078 A. This wavelength was then used to further refine the CVB3 cell dimensions. From the Chessl data, 21 films that processed well, showed good R factors between symmetry-related reflections, and scaled well together were selected as the standard film set. Refined cell dimensions were obtained from post-ref'tnement of this partial data set. The films were then reprocessed with the new cell dimensions, rescaled and the cell dimensions were post-refined again. This cycle continued until no further changes in cell dimensions occurred. The refined cell dimensions were a = 574.61, b = 302.07, c = 521.62,~,, ot = ), = 90.0 and /~ = 107.68 °. The remaining films from Chessl (164 films), Chess2 (59 films) and Chess3 (110 films) were processed assuming the post-refined cell dimensions. Films from the three data trips were processed and post-refined independently. The post-refined cell dimensions for each data trip

differed slightly from the assumed standard cell dimensions by an average of 0.05%. The deviations observed were essentially proportional for each cell dimension and suggested that the wavelength differed slightly for each data trip. The wavelengths for Chess2 and Chess3 were proportionally adjusted to the average cell-dimension deviation. Because the deviations observed in the cell dimensions were small, films were not reprocessed. The results of post-refinement for the standard films, Chess 1, Chess2, and Chess3 are presented in Table l(a). Obtaining the final high-quality data set involved extensive reprocessing and analysis of the initial data set which consisted of 354 films. All of the films were reprocessed using an orientation matrix that was refined against observed reflections at 4.0.& resolution as opposed to 9.0--15.0 A, resolution. This resulted in more accurately indexed reflections at high resolution, improved R factors between symmetry-related reflections and produced about 10% more accepted reflections per film. In addition, all films were processed using a wavelength of 0.908 ,&. Six crystals included in the initial 354 films were found to be of a different but related space group and were discarded from the data set. A

number of films were rejected due to poor merging R factors relative to other films in the data set. Typically, a film would be rejected if its merging R factor was greater than 20% in the 5.0A resolution bin. Statistics for the initial and final data sets are shown in Table l(b).

Characterization of pseudo-symmetry A striking property of the CVB3 films was the pattern of alternating strong and weak iunes at low resolution (Fig. 2). This suggested the existence of translational pseudosymmetry in the crystal-packing arrangement. Because some of the reflections were weak or absent at low resolution, it was important to include high-resolution reflections while indexing each film to obtain a correct initial orientation matrix for film processing. As a consequence, the orientation matrix predicted reflections at low resolution that were weak or not visible on the film. Only at higher resolution were there observed reflections for most of the predicted reflections. Reflection intensities were plotted against resolution for different classes of reflections (Fig. 3a). Reflections

JODI K. MUCKELBAUER et al. with h + k, k + 1. h + l = 2n (even) reflections were much stronger than the 2n + 1 (odd) reflections at low resolution. However, the odd reflection intensities increased with resolution until they became equal with the even reflections at approximately 4.0,~, resolution

(Figs. 3b and 3c). This showed that the monoclinic cell was pseudo face-centred with one virion per lattice point and, hence, established the approximate positions of the particles in the unit cell and demonstrated that all particles have approximately the same orientation.

COXSACKIEVIRUS B3 the fivefold (x = 72°), threefold (x = 120 °) and twofold (x -- 180 °) rotations were consistent with an icosahedral constellation of symmetry oprators (Figs. 4a and 4b). The self-rotation function results also suggested that all four virions shared similar orientations at 6 . 0 A resolution, which is consistent with the pseudo face-centering property observed on the films.

one of the icosahedral twofold axes was parallel to the monoclinic twofold b axis.

If CVB3 packed in a true R32 arrangement, the odd reflections would have been completely absent. The odd reflections must then arise from, any one or a combination of, a lack of R32 symmetry in cell dimensions, difference in virion orientations or displacement of particles form exact face-centering. For true R32 packing, the a(,,,) axis would fall along an icosahedral twofold and the virions would pack in a fivefold to fivefold manner (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1981). The a(,,) axis of the CVB3 cell is 3.2 ° away from an icosahedral twofold making the B face-centered particle's fivefold axes misalign from the fivefold, in the ideal R32 cell, by 5 c. This deviation in R32 cell dimensions in part accounts for the R32 pseudosymmetry (Fig. 6).

High-resolution self-rotation functions
Self-rotation functions using data between 3.5 and 3.6,~, resolution were calculated in order to determine deviations of virion orientations from R32 symmetry. Fine searches were performed in 0.1 ° steps around each of the twofold, threefold and fivefold peaks. For both the initial and final data sets, most of the peaks were spherical and showed no obvious splitting while other peaks were not spherical and hinted of possible splitting (oval or clover leaf shapes). Hence, different orientations for each of the fOUroPanicles could not be assigned with confidence at 3.5 A resolution. However, self-rotation functions, using the final CVB3 data set between 3.0 and 3.2 ,~ resolution, were sufficient to observe peak splitting and to assign orientations for each panicle in the unit cell (Fig. 4a). The orientation of the two independent panicles in the monoclinic asymmetric unit (particles 1 and 2) and their symmetry-related particles (1 s and 2s), in polar angles, were determined to be, Particle 1:q9 = 315.6 ~ ~ = 1.8' x -- 20.3 ° Particle Is: q9 = 315.6 ° 7z = - 1 . 8 ° x = 20.3 ° Particle 2:q9 = 319.3 ~' 7z = 1.9 ° x = 21.6 ° Particle 2s: ~0 = 319.3 ° 7z = - 1 . 9 ° x -- 21.6 °. The panicles deviate from the R32 orientations by ~ p - - + 1 . 8 ° , x = - 0 . 6 ° for particles 1 and ls and by 7z = 4-1.9 °, x -- 0.7 ° for particles 2 and 2s (Figs. 4d and 4e). Deviations in 7z from 0 ° represent deviations

between an icosahedral twofold axis and the monoclinic twofold along b and result in vertical peak splitting as seen on Figs. 4(d) and 4(e). Deviations in k: from 20.9 ° represent differences in orientations between the two independent particles and result in horizontal peak splitting. The symmetry-related icosahedra (one relative to Is, two relative to 2s) are tilted by ~O in opposite directions away from the monoclinic b axis. The value of q9 then represents the point of intersection along the monoclinic mirror plane 0 p = 90 °) where the two symmetry-related icosahedral constellations intersect and, at this point, the peaks do not split vertically (Fig. 4d). The orientations for the four particles were confirmed by calculating structure factors using H R V 1 4 model placed into the CVB3 cell at the facecentred positions and in the above determined orientations. The 3 . 0 A self-rotation functions using the model structure factors showed peaks that matched the observed CVB3 peaks (Figs. 4a and 4e) and confirmed the assigned orientations. The initial CVB3 data set also showed split peaks at 3.0~, resolution, however, the peaks were much less interpretable as compared to the final data set peaks (Fig. 4 f ) . Peaks, arising most likely from particle packing interactions (Akervall et al., 1972), were evident for a number of high-resolution peaks and were reproducible using the model structure factors (Fig. 4e). The determination of the deviations from exact R32 orientation was crucial in the subsequent process of the structure determination.

COXSACKIEVIRUS B3 The correct monoclinic space-group setting was determined by calculating R factors (defined in Table 2b) between CVB3 Fobs and HRV14 Fcalc'S for each of the six settings. Model structure factors and phases were calculated by placing HRV14 coordinates into the CVB3 cell in the correct particle orientations but at the face-centered positions as defined by each of the six packing arrangements. R factors were calculated using 2000 reflections within a defined resolution range for a number of ranges. Space group P2~(z)-I showed consistent low R factors (except at 3.0A resolution) relative to the others and was determined to be the correct monoclinic space group setting (Table 2a). The trend of low R factors for space group P21(z)-I was observed even for the initial data set. Without the correct particle orientations, the space-group assignment based on R-factor analysis was not possible. Initial particle positions were determined using a rigidbody least-squares refinement procedure (Arnold & Rossmann, 1988) minimizing the difference between observed and calculated structure factors from HRV14

Detern~ination of the correct monoclinic space-group packing arrangement
Fig. 7 illustrates three pairs of possible face-centered monoclinic space-group settings for CVB3. The first pair are P2 l, {P21(x)-I and P2t(x)-2 }, with the particles sitting at x -- -, ~ relative to the monoclinic screw axes. tThe second pair are P2 I, {P21(z)-I and P21(z)-2}, with the particles sitting at z = ::k J relative to the monoclinic screw axes. The third pair are monoclinic P2, {P2-1 and P2-2}. In the case where particles sit at the face-centered positions, each of the settings would be the same and would be related by a shift in origin. However, in the case of CVB3, these six possible settings are not the same; the face-centering breaks down and, hence, the choice of origin becomes unique. In addition, the choice of monoclinic asymmetric unit between pairs also becomes unique. The space-group settings within a pair ( e . g . P2-1 and P2-2) differ in how the particle orientations, found by the rotation functions, are distributed amongst the four particles in the unit cell.

Fig. 7. The six different monoclinic space-group settings for CVB3 showing the placement of the four virions in the unit cell for the symmetryrelated particles (1 and Is) and (2 and 2s). The open and hatched spheres indicate particles at y = 0 and y = ½, respectively. The difference between each pair (e,g. P2-1 an P2-2) is determined by the particle orientations associated with one asymmetric unit (1 and 2 and 1 and 2s). For face-centred packing, the settings are equivalent and are related by an origin shift. However, when the face-centering breaks down, as in the case of CVB3, each setting becomes unique. Also shown are two possible rotation-function peak splitting patterns and the resulting Patterson peak heights for each case. These patterns correspond to the position of maximum splitting along the equator of rotation-function plots, which would be around ~0 = 45 ° Patterson map analysis suggested that the Patterson peak height order was A > B > C or B > A > C consistent with the correct spac¢ group P2j (z)-I and the observed deviations of particle orientations from R32 orientations (~' splitting > r splitting).

The positions determined deviated from the face-centered positions by 0.8 and 1.1 A, for particles 1 and 2, respectively. Particle orientations and positions where further refined at a later stage (see section on molecular replacement).

Patterson analysis
As an icosahedral twofold axes of each of the two icosahedral particles in the asymmetric unit was nearly parallel to the monoclinic twofold axis, it might have been expected that the positions of the particles could have been determined by looking for Harker peaks between symmetry-related particles (Tsao et al., 1992; Zlotnick et al., 1993). However, such peaks were hidden behind diffraction ripples around the 'origin peaks' caused by the pseudo face-centered symmetry. Nevertheless, the relative heights of the pseudo origin peaks gave good confirmation to the choice of space-group setting when combined with the rotation-function results (Fig. 7). If all virus particles in the pseudo face-centered monoclinic cell were identically oriented and with one of their icosahedral axes parallel to the monoclinic b axis, the Patterson peak heights for the A, B and C facecentered peaks would be equal to each other and the origin. Any deviation of particle orientation from the pseudo R32 orientation would contribute to the breakdown of equality of the Patterson peak heights at the face-centered positions. Fig. 7 shows, in addition to the

six monoclinic space-group settings, two possible rotation-function peak-splitting patterns for each setting. The two rotation-function peak-splitting patterns define circumstances when either the orientations of the two symmetry-related particles differ more than the independent particles (~ splitting > x splitting) or when the orientation of the independent particles differ more than the symmetry-related particles (x splitting > ~ splitting). Table 3 shows the relative observed peak heights of various Patterson maps. The previously described rotation-function results 0P splitting > x splitting) would require the Patterson peak heights to have the sequence B > A > C consistent with P21(z)-I or P2-1. The observed peak heights, from Table 3, are either ,4 > B > C or B > A > C , where A and B are nearly equivalent. The Patterson maps consistent with the correct space groups were based on the odd terms only which amplify the effect of the departure from a pseudo face-centered lattice.

Heavy-atom analysis
To aid in the determination of CVB3 particle orientations, positions and space-group setting, data was collected on crystals soaked with an iodinated antiviral (WIN) compound provided by Sterling-Winthrop Pharmaceutical Research Division (Fig. 8). Previous crystallization studies of HRV14 complexed with WIN compounds showed that these hydrophobic drugs bind into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the fl-barrel of VP1 (Smith et al., 1986; Badger et al., 1988). The drugs complexed with virus inhibit infectivity by blocking cellular attachment or by inhibiting viral uncoating (Fox,

Otto & McKinlay, 1986; Pevear et al., 1989). Because these WIN compounds are also active against CVB3Gauntt (D. Pevear, Sterling-Winthrop Pharmaceutical Research Division, personal communication) and most likely bind into the fl-barrel of VP1, it had been our intention to utilize the heavy atom, iodine, in a WIN compound to determine particle positions, orientations and space-group setting. Crystals of CVB3, in the sitting drops, were soaked in the iodinated compound WIN 66393; 10lal of a 10mgm1-1 drug stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to 10 ml of synthetic mother liquor to obtain a 101agml-~ concentration of WIN 66393 in solution. 100 lal of the drug-synthetic mother liquor solution was slowly added to the sitting drop. The reservoir solution [2M (NH4)2SO4] was removed and replaced with synthetic mother liquor and the sitting-drop trays were resealed. The crystals were soaked with drug for no less than 24 h prior to data collection. The synthetic mother liquor solution was obtained by placing 100lal of MES buffer, pH 6.0, with 0.75 M NaCI in the well of a sitting drop, without virus protein, and was allowed to equilibrate with the reservoir solution for the same period of time as the crystals. Data were collected at the CHESS F-1 station using both film (12.7 x 12.7cm Kodak DEF X-ray film, oscillation=0.3 and 0.4 °, wavelength = 0.914 and 0.908,4,, crystal-to-film distance - - 1 9 0 m m ) and image plates (Fuji image plates, oscillation -- 0.3 and 0.4 °, wavelength -- 0.908A, crystal-to-film distance--300, 350 or 375mm). The WIN 66393-CVB3 data were indexed, processed and post-refined as previously described in this paper or were indexed using the HKL package (Wladek Minor &

JODI K. MUCKELBAUER et al. Zbyszek Otwinowski, unpublished work). Final statistics for the WIN 66393-CVB3 data are given in Table l(b). The data were scaled to the native CVB3 structure amplitudes using local scaling within limited resolution ranges. Electron-density maps were calculated using [F(drug ) -- F(native)]O)(native) exp[iqg(native)], where F(drug ) and F(native) are structure-factor amplitudes for the drug-virus complex and native data, respectively; qg(native) is the phase of the native structure obtained from non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (assuming particular virion positions, orientations in a particular space-group setting); and O)(native) are figures of merit (Arnold & Rossmann, 1988). The difference electrondensity maps were averaged and skewed into an isosahedral asymmetric unit (triangle shown in Fig. 8) for viewing. Regardless of the choice of monoclinic space-group setting, an iodine peak was always observed at the predicted drug-binding position within VP1 when all reflections or the even reflections were used to calculate the difference maps (Fig. 8). However, an iodine peak was observed for the odd reflections only when the correct space-group setting had been determined. The phases for the odd reflections in the incorrect space-group settings were essentially random. Until the 3.0 A resolution self-rotation function had been correctly interpreted, in terms of the correct space-group setting, the space-group setting had been assigned to be P2-1 based on Patterson map peak heights and molecularreplacement averaging statistics. With this space-group setting, the odd terms did not contribute to the iodine peak and the average of the iodine peak position, for each particle using the even reflections, was invariably at the special positions. Thus, the iodine difference maps were not able to resolve the nature of the breakdown from R32 symmetry.

Molecular replacement at 3.5 A, resolution Phase improvement and extension by means of electrondensity averaging and solvent flattening is now a well established procedure (Rossmann, 1990; Lawrence, 1991) and is particularly useful in the structure determination of viruses with their high non-crystallographic redundancy. All the molecular-replacement averaging and Fourier transformation procedures for CVB3 were carried out using programs on an Intel Paragon parallel computer (Rossmann et al., 1992; Cornea-Hasegan et al., 1995). The averaged electron density is given by, 1 u Pave(X) = ~ ~ P(Xn), where the electron density, p, is averaged at point x over

The particle orientations determined from the rotation functions and the initial particle positions determined from rigid-body refinements were further refined using a real-space averaging procedure that minimized or(p). Refinement of particle orientations and positions by minimizing or(p) was an iterative process that began with placing the electron density of a HRV14 particle into the CVB3 cell at the best CVB3 positions and orientations. The HRV14 map in the CVB3 cell was back transformed to generate calculated structure factors and phases. The calculated phases were then combined with the CVB3 Fob s and an electron-density map was calculated. This map was then averaged 60-fold for each particle separately into a small volume of an isosahedral asymmetric unit in the standard orientation. From the initial best CVB3 positions and orientations, a systematic search or 'climb' was performed in x, y, z (fractional coordinates) and 01,02, 03 (Eulerian angles) to locate the positions and orientations that resulted in the minimum value of or(p). The search increments were initially coarse for angular and positional parameters (0.1 ° and 0.5 ,~) and became finer (0.01 ° and 0.05 A) as the search progressed. The new positions and orientations were then used to start the process over again (HRV14 model density was placed into the CVB3 cell at the new positions and orientations and back transformed to calculate new phases. The new phases and the CVB3 Fobs were used to calculate a new map on which the climb procedure was performed again). This cycle continued until no further movements in particle positions and orientations were observed. The climb procedure for o-(p) minimization was first carried out at 5.0A and then at 3.5 ~, resolution. The initial particle orientations and positions used for the 5,~, resolution climb were those derived from the high-resolution rotation-function results and the rigid-body refinements, respectively. For the 3.5 .~, resolution climb, the particle orientations and positions used were those obtained from the 5.0A resolution climb. Substantial changes in the particle positions (0.7 and 0.6 ,~ for particle 1 and particle 2, respectively) were observed using the climb procedure at 5.0 A resolution, as compared to the initial rigid-body refinement positions. However, there was effectively no change observed in particle positions between the 5.0 and 3.5A, resolution climbs. The particle orientations

remained rather constant thoughout each of the climb procedures (Table 4). Molecular-replacement real-space averaging was carried out using the refined particle positions and orientations and HRV14 as an initial phasing model. 14 cycles of 120-fold averaging, solvent flattening and phase refinement were performed with 30.0 to 3.5 .~, resolution data. There was no phase extension, only phase improvement. A spherical mask with inner and outer radii of 75 and 165 A, respectively, defined the molecular protein envelope. The electron-density maps were calculated using figure of merit weighting and reflections greater than three times Fobs/~r(Fobs). The R factor and correlation coefficient (CC) after the first cycle of averaging were 31.9% and 0.720, respectively. After 14 cycles of averaging, the R factor and CC had converged to 19.2% and 0.894, respectively (Fig. 9b). Both R and CC were based on the comparison of Fobs and Fcalc; the later being derived from the back transform of the averaged map associated with the given cycle. Most satisfying were the averaging statistics for the odd reflections whose CC's were now equal to those of the even reflections. In earlier averaging trials, using an incorrect space-group setting with incorrect particle positions and orientations, the CC for the odd reflections never exceeded 0.2 while the even reflections had CC values around 0.8 (Fig. 9a). Attempts were made to utilize the climb procedure for particle position and orientation refinement using the WIN 66393 iodine difference electron-density maps. Climbs to both maximize the value of electron density at that iodine position or minimize o'(p) proved to be unsuccessful in determining correct particle positions and orientations. It is most likely that these attempts were unsuccessful because they were carded out using the incorrect space-group setting.

computer graphics program O (Jones, Zou, Cowan & Kjeldgaard, 1991). Out of 850 amino acids, only 32 were not visible: 1-12 for VP1, 1-7 for VP2 and amino acids 11-23 of VP4. These 32 residues are primarily located on the inner surface of the viral capsid and are assumed to be disordered. The HRV 14 model bias was completely eliminated as observed by the many differences between the CVB3 density and the HRV14 model coordinates. The CVB3 BC loop on VP1, which is nine amino acids shorter than the homologous loop of HRV14, was well defined and the CVB3 structure fit the new loon beautifully (Fig. 10a). Not included in the model, but present in the CVB3 structure, were ten amino-ac|d residues plus a myristate moiety comprising the N terminus of VP4. Also, an unidentified moiety, a 'pocket factor', was observed inside the the fl-barrel of VP1 (Fig. 10b). A similar pocket factor has been observed in polioviruses and human rhinovirus 16 (Filman et al., 1989; Flore, Fricks, Filman & Hogle, 1990; Oliveira et al., 1993).

Refinement using X-PLOR
After the initial structural model was built, the CVB3 atomic coordinates were refined by conjugate-gradient minimization using X-PLOR (Brtinger, 1992). The purpose was primarily to obtain reasonable geometry and avoid unacceptable non-bonded atomic contacts. Icosahedral symmetry was retained by constraining the non-crystallographically related subunits during minimization. The X-ray crystallographic energy term minimized was,
WA ~ Wh[]Fobs(h)[ - k]Fcalc(h)]]2 NA h

Map interpretation and model building
The CVB3 electron-density map was skewed into an icosahedral asymmetric unit for viewing on an Evans and Sutherland and a SGI graphics computer. The quality of the CVB3 electron-density map as very good for 3.5 ~, resolution. The amino-acid sequence of CVB3 was easily modeled into the CVB3 electron density using the

where W a is an overall weight between the X-ray crystallographic energy term and the empirical energy term, w h are weights for the individual reflections, N a is a normalization factor, k is a scale factor, h are the Miller indices of the structure-factor amplitudes. The overall weight, W A, was obtained by running a short moleculardynamics calculation, excluding the effective X-ray energy during dynamics, that determined the empirical and X-ray energies. WA was calculated by comparing the

normal of the gradient of the empircal energy terms to the X-ray energy terms. Because W a tends to be overestimated (Weis, Briinger, Skehel & Wiley, 1990) a value of 0.5 W A was used during geometric refinement. As the phases had been well determined by the 120-fold averaging process, it might have been appropriate to add a phasing restraint (Arnold & Rossmann, 1988). However, as the coordinates were icosahedrally constrained,

the phases were effectively restrained by the noncrystallographic symmetry. Distance geometry constants, used for the conformational and non-bonded energy terms, were those of Engh & Huber (1991). A total of 250 cycles of energy minimization were carried out with a fixed B value of 18.0,~2 using 30.0-3.5 A resolution data with no modeled water molecules. The R factor converged from 34.0 to 28.3% for all 1 301 023 reflections (Fig. 11). The ~0, ~p angle distributions showed 98.4% of the amino acids (excluding glycines and prolines) were in the most favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The new model was visually inspected on graphics and for amino acids with disallowed tp, ~p angles were rebuilt using O (Jones et al., 1991). The adjusted model was then subjected to 250 additional cycles of energy minimization as described above using all reflections (1 252 081) between 10.0 and 3.5 ,~ resolution with no modeled water molecules. The R factor for the current model was 26.4% (Fig. 11) and r.m.s, deviations in bond distances and bond angles were 0.013,~, and 1.8 °, respectively. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank.* An analysis of the structure is described elsewhere (Muckelbauer et al., 1995).
