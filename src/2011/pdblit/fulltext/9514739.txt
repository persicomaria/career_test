Staphylococcal enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 are known as superantigens due to their ability to activate a large number of T-cells by crosslinking the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules with the T-cell receptor. Although superantigens seem to act by a common mechanism, they vary in many of their speci®c interactions and biological properties. A structural comparison of staphylococcal enterotoxins A and C2, members of the staphylococcal superantigens, has shown large conformational differences at the putative TcR interaction site (loops between aN-a2, a4-b9 and b10-a5 in staphylococcal enterotoxin A) that could explain the variability in their T-cell receptor speci®city. A common Zn2-binding site was identi®ed in both staphylococcal enterotoxin A and C2 that is superimposable but differs somewhat in its coordination geometry between the two molecules.

Introduction
Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxins associated with food-poisoning and toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1) associated with the lifethreatening disease, toxic shock syndrome. Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) and TSST-1 are known as microbial superantigens because of their potent immuno-stimulatory properties (White et al., 1989). Although the exact mode of action of the superantigens remains unclear, it is well established that they form a tri-molecular complex with the T-cell receptor (TcR) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule (Marrack & Kappler, 1990; Herman et al., 1991). However, recent evidence indicates that direct binding to the TcR in the absence of MHC II is also possible (Gascoigne & Ames, 1991). The common mechanism among the superantigens is that they circumvent the normal mode of antigen presentation by

interacting with MHC class II molecules as intact proteins. Moreover, superantigens interact with the variable region of the b subunit of the T-cell receptor (Vb TcR; White et al., 1989; Kappler et al., 1989), whereas normal antigens bind to several of the variable elements of the TcR (Fleischer & Schrezenmeier 1988; Janeway, 1991; White et al., 1989; Marrack & Kappler, 1990). There are six serotypes of the SEs, A, B, C(1-3), D, E and H, with varying molecular mass from 22 to 29 kDa (Marrack & Kappler, 1990; Ren et al., 1994) and amino acid sequence identity ranging from 25 to 83%, with SEA and SEE having the highest similarity (Betley et al., 1992). Depending on their type, SEs bind to different isotypes of Vb TcRs. SEs can be further classi®ed into two groups based on sequence homology: SEA, SED and SEE form one group and SEB and SEC the other. The recently discovered SEH most likely belongs to the former group (Ren et al., 1994). The serotype SEC is further subdivided into three different isotypes, C1 to C3, due to minor epitope differences (Choi et al., 1990). To date, three-dimensional structures of SEA È (Schad et al., 1995; Sundstrom et al., 1996a), SEB (Swaminathan et al., 1992), SEC2 (Papageorgiou et al., 1995; Swaminathan et al., 1995), SED È (Sundstrom et al., 1996b), TSST-1 (Prasad et al.,

1993; Acharya et al., 1994) have been determined using X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, crystallographic studies on SEB (Jardetzky et al., 1994) and TSST-1 (Kim et al., 1994) in complex with an MHC class II molecule (HLA-DR1) and SEC2/ SEC3 in complex with a T-cell receptor b chain (Fields et al., 1996) have elucidated the structural details on their mode of binding. From the available data it appears that each superantigen has a slightly different mode of binding to MHC class II molecules. Moreover, SEA, besides the SEB-like mode, appears to have an additional mode of binding to MHC class II molecules involving a zinc ion (Fraser et al., 1992; Hudson et al., 1995). It has been shown that SEA loses its ability to bind MHC class II molecules when depleted of zinc with EDTA (Fraser et al., 1992). The recent crystal structure determination of SED revealed a different role for the È zinc ion in this toxin (Sundstrom et al., 1996a). In particular, the zinc ion may not be directly involved in MHC class II binding but might induce homodimerization of SED. Each monomer is then free to interact with MHC class II molecules in the same way as seen for SEB. Although zinc was originally thought to bind only to the SEA serotype (Fraser et al., 1992), recent structural results for SEC2 have revealed a zinc-binding site that is different from the corresponding one in SEA (Papageorgiou et al., 1995). Moreover, a second Zn2-site in SEA has been identi®ed that is superimposable with the Zn2-site in SEC2 (unpublished results). Here, we report a detailed structural comparison between SEA and SEC2, and highlight some important structural features crucial for understanding the molecular basis for the function of these superantigens.

Results and Discussion
The models The three-dimensional structures of SEA (Schad et al., 1995) and SEC2 (Papageorgiou et al., 1995) determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolÊ ution of 1.9 and 2.0 A, respectively, were used as models for the comparison (Figure 1; deposited at the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under the ®lecodes 1ESF for SEA and 1STE for SEC2). The structural alignment (with residues 141 and 142 in SEA excluded) using the program SHP (Stuart et al., Ê 1979) yielded an r.m.s deviation of 2.01 A for 213 Ca atoms and a 32% sequence identity between the two proteins (Figure 2). The accessible surface area as calculated using the program GRASP (Nicholls Ê et al., 1991) with a probe radius of 1.4 A was 11,124 Ê and 10,850 A2 for SEA and SEC2, respectively. In the SEA structure, a cadmium ion was present instead of a zinc ion due to the crystallization conditions (Schad et al., 1995). The C-terminal residue Gly239 is disordered in the SEC2 model and residues 60 to 63 are disordered in SEA. The disulphide loop is highly ¯exible in both structures. In

the crystal structure of SEC2, this loop (between residues 93 and 110) is partially disordered and has diffuse electron density. Common core architecture The structures of the SEs determined so far consist of a single polypeptide chain folded into two closely packed domains I and II (Figure 1). Brie¯y, domain I contains a b-barrel made of two b-sheets (residues 31 to 116 in SEA; 29 to 120 in SEC2) that has been classi®ed as an OB-fold (Murzin, 1992). Each sheet is composed of three b-strands connected by a disulphide loop at the top of the barrel. Domain II contains a ``b-grasp'' motif, which is a mixed b-sheet packed against a single helix connecting the peripheral strands (Overington, 1992). The b-sheet contains ®ve b-strands (the two inner strands b6 and b12, are parallel with each other

273 the glycine residue in SEC2 (phi, psi  89 , À5 ). The length and directionality of the disulphide loop varies in the two structures (11 residues and 18 residues in SEA and SEC2, respectively). Zinc-binding in SEA and SEC2 Based on biochemical studies (Fraser et al., 1992) and the crystal structure analysis of SEA (Schad et al., 1995), it has now been established that binding of a zinc ion with high af®nity (KD  0.3mM) is an inherent property of this molecule and appears to have a potential role when it interacts with MHC class II molecules (Hudson et al., 1995, È Sundstrom et al., 1996b). A zinc-binding site was discovered de novo from the crystal structure of SEC2 (Papageorgiou et al., 1995). From recent crystal soaking experiments with zinc at high concentrations it has now been established that SEA has a second Zn2-binding site that occupies a position structurally equivalent to the Zn2-binding site in SEC2{. We shall refer to this site as the common Zn2 -binding site throughout our discussion. SEA zinc-binding site (high-affinity site) The high-af®nity Zn2-site found in SEA is situated on the surface of the b-sheet in domain II close to the N-terminal end of the b12 strand È (Schad et al., 1995; Sundstrom et al., 1996b). The amino acid residues involved in direct coordination of the zinc ion are Ser1, His187, His225 and Asp227 as well as a less well de®ned water molecule. The ligands around the metal ion display octahedral coordination. It is known that Ala substitution of His225 and Asp227 in SEA results in a more than 10,000-fold reduced MHC class II binding af®nity, whereas His187 to Ala mutation displays only a tenfold reduced binding af®nity Ân (Abrahmse et al., 1995). This suggests that modi®cation of the short spacer bidentate formed by His225 and Asp227 severely affects the zinc-binding of SEA. In contrast, mutations of His187 have less effect on the zinc binding. SEC2 has Ile190, Lys229 and Glu231 in lieu of His187, His225 and Asp227 at this location. This precludes zinc binding, since there is no analogous recruitment of zinc ligands in this region. Common Zn2-binding site of SEA and SEC2 Crystallographic analysis of SEA crystals soaked in 10 mM ZnCl2 revealed a second Zn2 -binding site (unpublished results), which corresponds to the zinc-site found in SEC2 (Papageorgiou et al., 1995). This site, located between the two domains, is superimposable in the two structures (Figure 4). A tetrahedral coordination is observed in both structures with angles ranging from 93.6 to 123.8 Ê and distances from 1.9 to 3.0 A. The temperature factors for the zinc atoms in SEA and SEC2 are Ê Ê 24 A2 and 12 A2, respectively. In SEC2, the ligands are Asp83, His118, His122 together with Asp9

and anti-parallel with the ¯anking b-strands) and are connected by a long a-helix (a4 in SEA; a5 in SEC2). An extension of the b-grasp motif is inserted between b10 and b12 that is composed of an a-helix (a5 in SEA; a6 in SEC2) and a b-strand (b11). The N-terminal tail packs against the outer side of the b-grasp motif. The different nomenclature used to describe SEA, SEB and SEC2 is shown in Figure 2. Most of the secondary structure elements as well as several loops in the two toxin Ê structures agree to within 3 A based on comparisons using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). Variance between SEA and SEC2 Despite the overall similarity, some loop regions Ê with deviations greater than 3 A are present in the two structures (Figure 3). The ®rst nine residues in SEA and the ®rst seven residues in SEC2 show a large deviation. These N-terminal tails, pointing in Ê different directions, are located some 18 A apart. Other signi®cant differences are found in the external loops between aN-a2 (residues 18 to 22) and a4-b9 (residues 172 to 176), which are further apart in SEA, displaying a more open structure with a Ê Ê distance of 16 A as opposed to 9 A in SEC2 between the main chains. In SEA, the loop between b10-a5 (residues 200 to 203) folds down towards Ê the a4 helix at a distance of 8.4 A from the corresponding SEC2 loop (residues 202 to 207). The loop between b1 and b2 superimposes well, except Ê for His 44 in SEA, which is some 4.3 A away from Val41 in SEC2. This histidine residue is solvent-accessible while SEC2-Val 41 is pointing towards the interior of the structure. In SEA there is high mobiÊ lity in this region (B-values between 30 and 40 A2 for the main chain) preventing any conclusive interpretations. At the turn of the loop between b9 and b10 the Ca atoms in residues SEA-Glu 191 and Ê SEC2-Gly 193 are 5.8 A apart, while the connecting Ê residues remain within 3 A. This may be due to an increased versatility of the main chain provided by
{ The data for the second zinc site in SEA were Ê re®ned at 2.9 A resolution to an R-factor of 17.8% using È the program X-PLOR version 3.1 (Brunger, 1992). A unique data set resulted from a crystal soaked in 10 mM ZnCl2. Data were collected on a Siemens X1000 area detector system mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode. First, a rigid body re®nement of the SEA structure, with alanine residues in the pertinent region, was performed. This was followed by positional and B-factor re®nement with the B-factors strongly restrained. B-values of water molecules were not re®ned. In an FZn À FCd Fourier map calculation (structure factors from the highconcentration zinc form and the cadmium form of the protein) two positive peaks at 10s above the average value of the map were found and interpreted as zinc ions, each ion binding to the same site in the two crystallographically independent SEA molecules. An additional water molecule in each monomer appeared in the subsequent Fo À Fc map which, when included in the coordinating sphere, makes a tetrahedral coordination of the zinc ion.

In addition, residues implicated in TcR interactions for SEC2/SEA are indicated in A, residues Â in SEC2 and SEA possibly involved in MHC class II interactions (Jardetzky et al., 1994; Abrahmsen et al., 1995; Papageorgiou et al., 1995; Schad et al., 1995) are shown in B and C, respectively. For further details, see Figure 2.

from a symmetry-related molecule. In SEA, two of the ligands (Asp86 and His114) are identical with those in SEC2 (Asp83 and His118, respectively). A water molecule replaces the second histidine residue in SEC2 and Glu39 replaces the fourth ligand (symmetry-related Asp9 in SEC2). Although Arg118 in SEA, which corresponds to His122 in SEC2, is too far away to participate in binding Ê (6 A), its side-chain forms a lid over the Zn2-site. Glu39 in SEA is positioned more favourably for Zn2 interaction (corresponds to Thr36 in SEC2). A second zinc-binding site similar to that of SEC2 was found in the crystal structure of SED È (Sundstrom et al. 1996a) at the interface of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The zinc ligands are His8 and Glu12 from one molecule, and His109 and Lys113 from the second molecule in the asymmetric unit. MHC class II binding There is now ample evidence suggesting that SEA possesses two distinct binding sites for MHC class II binding with different af®nities Ân (Abrahmse et al., 1995). It has recently been discovered that SEA forms trimers with MHC class II in solution. It has been shown that the preferred trimeric con®guration is (MHC)1(SEA)2 (Tiedemann et al., 1995). The ®rst binding site involves the N-terminal Zn2 (high-af®nity site), while the

second involves the b-barrel (SEB-like site or lowÂ af®nity site; Abrahmsen et al., 1995). Due to the absence of the zinc ion in domain II, SEC2 cannot form a MHC class II contact as in the SEA high-af®nity site. However, mutagenesis and peptide data for SEC1 have shown that a region corresponding to the area around the SEC2 zincbinding site is important for MHC class II binding (Hoffmann et al., 1994). Furthermore, binding studies with SEC2 and SEE suggested a model in which each of these two toxins could crosslink two adjacent MHC class II molecules (Hargreaves et al., 1995).

A docking experiment of SEA and SEC2 onto the SEB-DR1 complex (Jardetzky et al., 1994) gives a good overall ®t for both molecules without any major stereochemical hindrance and an SEB-like MHC class II binding is, with high probability, present in SEC2. However, important differences were observed for SEA (Table 1; Figure 5). A characteristic salt bridge that is observed in the SEB-DR1 complex between Lys39 of the a1 helix and Glu67 of SEB is present in the SEC2-DR1 model but probably not in the SEA-DR1, as the glutamic acid residue is replaced by the shorter aspartic acid residue (Asp70). Mutations of residues Phe44 and Leu45 in

276 SEB disrupt binding to MHC class II molecules (Kappler et al., 1992). Mutation of the corresponding invariant residues in SEA also result in a protein with reduced MHC class II binding activity Â (Harris et al., 1993; Abrahmsen et al., 1995). Tyrosine 94 of SEB (Tyr94 in SEC2) is involved in hydrophobic interactions with DR1 residues 60 and 61. SEA has an alanine residue in this position (Ala97), which could prevent interaction with the DR1 molecule locally. Mutation of Tyr94 in SEB to alanine resulted in partial inhibition of DR1 binding (Ulrich et al., 1995). Tyrosine residues 89 and 115 of SEB are conserved amongst SEA, SEB and SEC2 and are positioned close to Lys39 of DR1, possibly giving rise to similar interactions. Finally, SEB Met215 is close to Gln57 in the SEB-DR1 complex and its replacement in SEA by arginine (Arg211 in SEA) might in¯uence the binding af®nity. In the model, Arg211 of SEA would clash with Gln57 unless these residues adopt a different conformation upon formation of the complex. So far, a number of different MHC-binding modes for superantigens have been observed. These are: (1) the original SEB-like binding demonstrated by the crystal structure of the SEB-DR1 complex (Jardetzky et al., 1994); (2) the TSST-1 binding mode, which has considerable similarity to the SEB-like mode as derived from the crystal structure of TSST-1-DR1 complex (Kim et al., 1994); (3) the SEA-binding mode with the involvement of a zinc-modulated, high-af®nity site as highlighted by Schad et al. (1995); (4) an SED-like binding È mode proposed by Sundstrom et al. (1996b) where zinc induces homodimerization of the enterotoxin with each monomer able to bind an MHC class II molecule in an SEB-like fashion; and (5) a possible additional binding mode for SEC2, involving zinc mediation, as described by Papageorgiou et al. (1995). Although there is limited experimental support (Hoffmann et al. 1994; Hargreaves et al., 1995) for the role of zinc in SEC2, its possible involvement in SEC2-MHC class II binding cannot be excluded: (1) the zinc ion is an intrinsic part of SEC2 with a dissociation constant less than 1 mM (Papageorgiou et al., 1995) comparable to that found for È SEA (Sundstrom et al., 1996a); (2) the zinc-site is situated on the same side of the molecule as in SEA and SED far away from the SEB-like binding site; and (3) one of the zinc ligands is a symmetryrelated molecule, which implies the presence of a water molecule in solution as a fourth ligand. Upon formation of the complex, this water molecule could be displaced by an appropriate residue from the MHC class II molecule. It has been proposed that His81 from the b-chain of the DR1 molecule is important for the binding of SEA/SEE (Fraser et al., 1992). Comparison of the TcR-binding site SEA and SEC2 recognize different isotypes of TcR Vb chain but share the same speci®city for

Comparison of Enterotoxins A and C2

mouse Vb10 and Vb17 chains (Kappler et al., 1992). No common speci®city is found between SEA and SEC2 for human Vb chains. In particular, SEA exhibits speci®city for human T-cells bearing Vb elements 1.1, 5.6, 7.3 and 9.1, while SEC2 prefers Vb12, 13.2, 14, 15, 17 and 20. In contrast, SECs have speci®cities similar to SEB, suggesting that they have analogous TcR-binding sites. Some new structural insights into the interactions of superantigens with TcR were recently provided by the Ê 3.5 A crystal structure of SEC2/SEC3 in complex with a TcR Vb chain (Fields et al., 1996). In view of this structure, the analysis of the TcR-binding sites of SEA and SEC2 should give further information on the recognition mechanisms adopted by superantigens. Mutational studies in SEA, SEB and SEE suggest that the TcR-binding site is located in a shallow cavity between the two domains (Kappler et al., 1992; Hudson et al., 1993; Mollick et al., 1993). A close examination of the cavity shows four residues conserved between SEA and SEC2 (Figure 6) pointing to the same direction. These are Thr21 (Thr20 in SEC2), Gly24 (Gly22), Asn25 (Asn23) and Leu210 (Leu214). Tyrosine 64, also conserved in both structures (Tyr61 in SEC2) is surrounded by a ¯exible loop. In SEC2 the corresponding loop is also characterized by high temperature factors. Threonine 21 in SEA and Thr20 in SEC2 show a large r.m.s deviation (Table 2), an indication of some ¯exibility, probably due to the immediate presence of a glycine residue (Gly20 in SEA, Gly19 in SEC2). Glycine 24 from the a2 helix in SEA and Gly22 in SEC2 (a3 helix) exhibit the same pattern of local contacts. Interestingly, the loops a4-b9 and b10-a5 (a5-b9 and b10-a6 in SEC2, respectively) located on either side of the a2 helix (a3 in SEC2) are quite different. Asparagine 25 in SEA superimposes well onto Asn23 in SEC2, and in both structures these two residues are exposed to the solvent. This asparagine residue is conserved among all the SEs and is thought to be crucial for the TcR interaction, as its mutation abrogates TcR activation in SEB (Kappler et al., 1992). In SEA, Asn25 ND2 is hydrogen bonded to Gln204 O (disÊ Ê tance 2.9 A; Table 2) and Thr21 O (3.4 A). A weak Ê ). In SEC2, interaction exists with Thr21 OG1 (3.6 A ND2 atom of Asn23 forms a single hydrogen bond Ê with Thr20 O (distance 3.2 A). No hydrogen bond interaction is observed for the OD1 atom in either structure. Thus, this atom seems to be available to participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Indeed, in the crystal structure of the SEC2-TcR Vb complex (Fields et al., 1996), the side-chain of Asn23 forms two hydrogen bonds with the mainchain atoms of Thr55 from the TcR. The side-chain of SEA Glu28 and its structural equivalent Tyr26 exhibit no hydrogen bond interaction. In the SEC2-Vb TcR structure, Tyr26 of SEC2 contacts Gly53 from the TcR Vb chain (Fields et al., 1996). Interestingly, in SEB, there is a valine residue in this position. Thus, the variance in this position among the three enterotoxins may confer

some speci®city to the TcR binding. It has been shown that residue 26 is one of the key residues conferring speci®city between SEC1 and SEC2 (Turner et al., 1992). Isoleucine 29 of SEA and Leu27 of SEC2 are both buried. SEA Asn33 has a side-chain pointing in the same direction as SEC2 His31. A difference that may also affect the TcR

speci®city could involve the side-chain of Lys35 in SEA, which is not hydrogen bonded but is solventexposed in contrast to the buried Val33 in SEC2. The loop comprising residues 60 to 63 in SEA, 55 to 61 in SEC2 and 56 to 61 in SEB is characterized by high ¯exibility. This loop has not been modelled in SEA and SEB. Two residues in this loop that are

invariant amongst SEB and SEC2 have been implicated in SEB-TcR interactions (Kappler et al., 1992). These residues are Asn60 and Tyr61 in both SEB and SEC2, corresponding to Trp63 and Tyr64 in SEA. Tyrosine 61 of SEC2 has an accessible surface Ê area of $20 A2 and is somewhat hidden by Tyr90. In SEA, Tyr64 has an orientation different from that of Tyr61 in SEC2, since it has to ®ll the empty space created by Gly93 (SEA) instead of Tyr90 (SEC2). The position of the loop may affect the binding of a number of residues to TcR and/or MHC class II molecules. For example, Asn88 and Tyr89 in SEC2 are buried due to the position of the loop (as modelled in SEC2) and the presence of His31, Val33, Tyr90 and Thr109. However, different conformations of this ¯exible loop could expose Asn88 and Tyr89 to the solvent. Their position in SEA is occupied by Tyr91 and Tyr92, which are solvent-accessible in the present SEA structure, since residues 60 to 63 have not been modelled. Two of the residues implicated in TcR-binding in SEA (Tyr94 and Tyr205; Swaminathan et al., 1995) are not conserved in SEC2 (Val91 and Asp209, respectively). It was pointed out by Fields et al. (1996) that replacement of Val91 by a tyrosine residue may be responsible for the reduced af®nity of SEB for 14.3 Vb chain. Furthermore, the aromatic groups of Tyr94 and Tyr205 in SEA form a lid over the putative binding site. SEC2 has a similar lid but at the other end of the cavity formed by Tyr26 (Glu28 in SEA). This difference in the architecture of the TcR-binding site may be important for the binding of appropriate Vb sequences.

Threonine 109 in SEC2, which corresponds to Thr112 in SEB has been proposed to be involved in TcR interactions (Swaminathan et al., 1995). However, this residue is buried in SEC2 and the corresponding residue in SEA (Ala105) is inaccessible to the solvent. Valine 174 and Phe175 from the a4-b9 loop in SEA are putative interaction points for the TcR molecule. These residues point away from the molecule and could stabilize the intermolecular interactions with TcR. Phenylalanine 176 from the corresponding region in SEC2 (a5-b9 loop) was found to interact with Lys66 from the TcR Vb chain (Fields et al., 1996). This region shows a large Ê deviation (5.4 A between SEA-Asp173 and SEC2Ser178) in the structural alignment of the two enterotoxins. Examination of the region 210 to 214 in SEC2 and 206 to 210 in SEB can give useful information for the Vb speci®city. Based on a homology model, Swaminathan et al. (1995) proposed that Ser206, Asn207 and Thr21 are the speci®city-de®ning residues in SEA. In addition, Hudson et al. (1993) have shown that an exchange of residues 206 and 207 in SEA to the homologous residues in SEE convert the SEA pro®le of corresponding TcR Vb families in human T-lymphocytes to that of SEE. Serine 206 is situated at the bottom of the cavity while Asn207 is pointed away from the cavity. Serine 206 and Asn207 correspond to Gln210 and Ser211, respectively, in SEC2 as well as in SEB. These residues are located in a region with large deviations of the Ca-chains between SEA and SEC2, mainly

because of a three-residue insertion in SEC2. Interestingly, Ser211 interacts with Gln57 from the DR1 molecule in the SEB-DR1 complex. Between Asn207 and the cavity, there are two tyrosine residues (94 and 205) that may, in combination with the proximity of 207 to the putative MHC class II binding site, prevent any interaction of Asn207 with the TcR molecule. The TcR-binding site for SEA, SEB and SECs has been proposed to be located in a cavity between the two domains. Biological data, in combination with the SEC2/SEC3-TcR Vb crystal structure (Fields et al., 1996) and the results from our structural comparison, indicate that the TcR-binding site is located (using the SEA nomenclature) across the a2 helix reaching towards the a4-b9 loop on one end and the region surrounding the loop between b10 and a5. This entire region, with the exception of the a2 helix, is ¯exible, implying that there might be some conformational rearrangement upon TcR-binding.
