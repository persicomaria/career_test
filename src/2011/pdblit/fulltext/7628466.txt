Arg44, located at the si-face side of the flavin ring in 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, was changed to lysine by site-specific mutagenesis. Crystals of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoate diffract to 0.22-nm resolution. The structure of [R44K]Chydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is identical to the wild-type enzyme except for local changes in the vicinity of the mutation. The peptide unit between Ile43 and Lys44 is flipped by about 180" in 50% of the molecules. The 4 , angles ~ in both the native and flipped conformation are outside the allowed regions and indicate a strained conformation. [R44K]4-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase has a decreased affinity for the flavin prosthetic group. This is ascribed to the lost interactions between the side chain of Arg44 and the diphosphoribose moiety of the FAD. The replacement of Arg44 by Lys does not change the position of the flavin ring which occupies the same interior position as in wild type. [R44K]4-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase fully couples flavin reduction to substrate hydroxylation. Stopped-flow kinetics showed that the effector role of 4-hydroxybenzoate is largely conserved in the mutant. Replacement of Arg44 by Lys however affects NADPH binding, resulting in a low yield of the charge-transfer species between reduced flavin and NADP'. It is inferred from these data that Arg44 is indispensable for optimal catalysis.

FAD-dependent aromatic hydroxylases are inducible enzymes which catalyze the insertion of one atom of molecular oxygen into the substrate, using NAD(P)H as external electron donor (van Berkel and Muller, 1991). The aromatic substrates act as effectors, stimulating the rate of enzyme reduction (Hosokawa and Stanier, 1966). As the reduced enzymes react readily with oxygen, the effector role of substrates is essential to prevent the wasteful utilization of high-energy reducing equivalents (Massey and Hemmerich, 1975). FAD-dependent aromatic hydroxylases are induced in soil microorganisms able to assimilate phenolic compounds as sole carbon source. In this way many secondary plant metabolites, decomposition products of lignin as well as aromatic pollutants, are readily subject to further catabolism (Middelhoven, 1993). 4-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens is the most extensively studied flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylase (van Berkel and Muller, 1991). The strictly NADPHdependent enzyme catalyzes the first step of the p-ketoadipate pathway, i.e. the conversion of 4-hydroxybenzoate into 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (Stanier and Omston, 1973):

The reaction sequence of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase has been studied in detail (Husain and Massey, 1979) and rapid reaction kinetics have shown that hydroxylation of the substrate proceeds through the attack of a labile C(4a)-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (Entsch et al., 1976). The availability of a high-resolution crystal structure of the enzymehbstrate complex (Wierenga et al., 1979 ; Schreuder et al., 1989) and the cloning of the pobA gene encoding 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Psuedomonas aeruginusa (Entsch et al., 1988) and R fluorescens (van Berkel et al., 1992) allow us to address the role of individual amino acid residues by sitedirected mutagenesis. Most mutagenesis studies performed have dealt with amino acid replacements in the substrate-binding site. In this way, much insight has been gained into the mechanism of substrate activation (Entsch and van Berkel, 1995). The effector specificity of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is less well understood. Recent crystallographic data indicate that subtle structural perturbations determine the poor effector role of 4-aminobenzoate derivatives (Schreuder et al., 1994). Understanding the effector specificity is limited by the fact that the binding mode of NADPH is unknown (van der Laan et al., 1989 a). Stereochemical studies showed that the nicotinamidebinding pocket is located at the fre-face of the flavin ring (Manstein et al., 1986). Based on these results and from crystallographic data of glutathione reductase (Pai and Schulz, 1983 ; Wierenga et al., 1983), a potential mode of NADPH binding was proposed (van Berkel et al., 1988). However, recent crystallo-

graphic data have revealed that the flavin ring can attain different orientations (Schreuder et al., 1994; Gatti et al., 1994; van Berkel et al., 1994). This leaves the intriguing possibility that flavin motion is not only essential for substrate binding and product release but also for efficient reduction by NADPH (van Berkel et al., 1994). To study this in more detail we decided to replace Arg44 with Lys by site-directed mutagenesis. Arg44 is located at the si-face of the flavin ring and is possibly involved in flavin motion and/or NADPH binding (Schreuder et al., 1994). Alteration of Arg44 is expected to yield important information about the role of this residue for the function of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase.

parameters of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase were determined at pH 8.0, essentially as described (Eschrich et al., 1993). Rapidreaction studies were performed in the stopped-flow apparatus using the single-wavelength mode. Kinetic traces of the oxidative half-reaction were analyzed according to published procedures (Entsch and Ballou, 1989; Eschrich et al., 1993). Rate constants for anaerobic flavin reduction were estimated from kinetic traces recorded at 450 nm at variable concentrations of NADPH (van Berkel et al., 1994). Rate constants for hydride transfer and NADP' dissociation were generated from best fits of stopped-flow traces (recorded at 690 nm) to the kinetic scheme of wild type (Husain and Massey, 1979) using the computer simulation program KINSIM (Barshop et al., 1983). The hydroxylation efficiency of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was estimated from oxygen-consumption experiments, either in the MATERIALS AND METHODS absence or presence of catalase (Eschrich et al., 1993).

The atomic model of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is drawn in continuous bold lines, while the orientation of Arg44 in wild-type 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is indicated in broken lines. The peptide unit between Ile43 and Lys44 is disordered, and about 50% of the peptides in the crystal are rotated by about 180" with respect to wild-type enzyme. To accomodate the flipping peptide, we refined two alternate conformations for residues 43 and 44. While the two alternate conformations are virtually identical for Lys44, they differ slightly for Ile43, as is visible in the figure by the two separate side chains. Both orientations of the side chain of Ile43 fit well to the electron-density map.

The final R-factor is 0.182 for 22697 reflections between 0.80 nm and 0.22 nm. The root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) deviations are 9 . nm for bond lengths and 1.4' for bond angles. All non-glycine residues have 4,y angles within, or close to, allowed regions. The only exceptions are Lys44 and Asp144 which (with Lys44 replaced by Arg) also deviate in the structures of other complexes of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from I? jluorescens (Schreuder et al., 1989, 1994). The peptide plane between Ile43 and Lys44 is disordered and two orientations have been modeled, each with half occupancy: the same orientation as in the wild-type enzymekubstrate complex, and a flipped orientation in which the peptide plane is rotated by about 180". The consequences for the 4,y angles of Lys44 will be discussed in detail with the results.

RESULTS Structural properties. The almost 97 % complete 0.22-nm data resulted in excellent electron-density maps (Fig. 1) which al-

lowed us to study the structure of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase in great detail. The overall structure of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase in complex with 4-hydroxybenzoate is almost identical to the structure of the wild-type enzymehbstrate complex. Superposition of the two revealed an r.m.s. difference of 0.015 nm for 391 equivalent c residues. As expected, " the differences were localized in the vicinity of the mutated residue. The differences are even here not very big, which may be due to the positive charge at position 44 being preserved in the Arg to Lys mutation. However, as Table 1 shows, some subtle differences exist in the interactions of the two side chains with the protein and the FAD. Most notable, the interaction between the NHI of Arg44 and the ribityl 04' seemed to be strong (d = 0.29 nm), while the interaction between the N r of Lys44 and the ribityl 04' in the mutant appeared to be much weaker (d = 0.33 nm). This and the lost interactions with the ribitylphosphate may explain the weaker FAD binding which was observed for [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. From activity measurements performed in the absence or presence of varying amounts of FAD, an apparent K , value for FAD of 1 pM was estimated. This value is about 20-fold higher than the corresponding value for wild type (Miiller and van Berkel, 1982). Another interesting feature is the orientation of the peptide unit between Ile43 and Lys44. The q5,y angles of Arg44 in wildtype enzyme had already attracted attention (Schreuder et al., 1989; Lah et al., 1994a) since Arg44 is located in the activesite region and its +,y angles are far outside allowed regions. As is shown in Figs 1 and 2, the peptide between Jle43 and Lys44 was disordered in [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. Using a Fo-Fc omit map with Lys44 omitted from the calculation of Fc and phases, we estimated that about 53% of the peptides in the crystal were flipped and 47% had the same orientation as in wild type. These occupancies are identical within experimental error and we modeled therefore two orientations of the peptide, each with half occupancy. The results of the refinement confirm that the Ile43-Lys44 peptide is flipped in about 50% of the molecules in the crystal. A flip of the Ile43-Arg44 peptide has also been observed by Lah et al. (1994b) after the addition of 200 mM potassium bromide to crystals of the wild-type enzymelsubstrate complex. The q5,y angles in both the native conformation and the flipped conformation are outside the allowed regions and point to a strained conformation in which none of the two observed conformations is very stable. The carbonyl oxygen in the flipping peptide (belonging to Ile43) interacts in both orientations only with solvent

molecules which will not provide much stabilization for either conformation. The reason for the strained conformation is simple. Fig. 2 shows that it is the v/ angle which is deviating, both for the native and the flipped conformation. The y angle was associated with the peptide between Lys44 and Ala45 and not with the peptide which flips. As has been discussed before (Schreuder et al., 1991), the 44-45 peptide is firmly held in place by a hydrogen bond of its carbonyl oxygen (belonging to residue 44) with the side chain of Arg214 and with a water molecule (Wat135 or Wat609 in Table 1) which, in turn, is fixed by hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Arg220 and Tyr222. It is not clear from the current structural data if this flipping peptide serves any catalytic function. In either conformation, the flipping peptide between residues 43 and 44 does not have any specific interactions with the protein in the known crystal structures. In the absence of any structural information on the interaction of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase with NADPH, we do not know whether this peptide interacts with bound NADPH.
Spectral properties. The optical flavin spectrum of [R44K]4hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase differs slightly from wild type (van Berkel et al., 1992) by showing absorption maxima at 370nm and 445 nm (Table 2). From recording absorption spectra in the absence and presence of 0.1% SDS (Entsch et al.,

1991), a value of E~~~ of 10.2 mM-' cm-' was estimated for the molar absorption coefficient of protein-bound FAD (Table 2). Fig. 3 shows the absorption difference spectra recorded upon titration of wild type (Fig. 3A) or [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Fig. 3 B) with 4-hydroxybenzoate. The shape of both sets of difference spectra indicates that the mutation induced marginal structural changes in the substrate-binding site. This is in full agreement with the 'in' position of the flavin observed in the crystal structure. Binding of 4-hydroxybenzoate to [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase resulted in about 70% quenching of the fluorescence of protein-bound FAD (pH7.0). From titration of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase with 4-hydroxybenzoate, simple 1:1 binding was observed and a dissociation constant for the enzymekubstrate complex of about 40 KMwas estimated. This value is in the same range as found for wild type (van Berkel et al., 1992). Wild-type 4-hydroxybenzoate hydrox-

[R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase were titrated with 4-hydroxybenzoate or 4-hydroxycinnamate and the increase in absorption was monitored from recording absorption difference spectra (Eschrich et al., 1993). The molar absorption differences are extrapolated to infinite ligand concentration and plotted against pH. (A) Molar absorption increase at 290 nm upon titration of 10 pM wild-type (0)or [R44K]4hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (0)with 4-hydroxybenzoate.

Ionization of the 4-hydroxyl group is expected to activate the substrate for hydroxylation (Vervoort et al., 1992). Binding of 4-hydroxybenzoate to [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase resulted in pHdependent absorption changes around 290 nm (Fig. 4A), indicative for the deprotonation of the phenolic moiety of the substrate (Shoun et al., 1979). The absorption changes are smaller than found for wild type (Eschrich et al., 1993), suggesting that the mutation affects the arrangement of the hydrogen-bonding network around the 4-hydroxyl group of the substrate. These perturbations must be small, because no structural changes in this region of the active site were detectable in the crystal structure. Therefore, and because the absorption changes at 290nm increased with increasing pH (Fig. 4A), we conclude that [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is capable of substrate activation. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the pK, of the competitive inhibitor 4-hydroxycinnamate (pK, = 9.3, free in solution) was decreased by more than 2 upon binding to [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Fig. 4 B). A comparable pK, shift has also been observed upon binding of 4-hydroxycinnamate to wild type (Entsch et al., 1991 ; Eschrich et al., 1993).

tion (Entsch et al., 1976). Replacement of Arg44 by Lys did not change the reaction stoichiometry. HPLC product analysis showed that the mutant enzyme exclusively formed 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate from 4-hydroxybenzoate with stoichiometric consumption of NADPH. In accordance with this, no production of hydrogen peroxide was detected in oxygen-consumption experiments. We therefore conclude that [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is an effective hydroxylase. This conclusion is further supported by rapid-reaction studies on the oxidative half-reaction. These studies were performed at pH 6.6 and 6°C in order to separate the individual reaction steps (Entsch and Ballou, 1989). When reduced [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoate is mixed with oxygen, the spectral changes and reaction rates are nearly indistinguishable from wild-type and indicative for the subsequent formation and decay of the flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide and flavin C(4a)-hydroxide (Entsch et al., 1976). The steady-state kinetic properties of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase were studied at pH 8.0, the pH optimum for wild-type enzyme (van Berkel and Muller, 1989). Table 3 shows that the maximum turnover rate of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (k,,, = 10 s-') at 25°C was about fivefold slower than wild type. In contrast to wild type, the maximum turnover rate of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was not influenced by decreasing the temperature to 6°C (Table 3). Table 3 also shows that the K,,, NADPH for [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was about one order of magnitude higher than for wild type, suggesting that the mutation affects the binding of NADPH. As a result, the catalytic efficiency of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (expressed as kc,JK,,, NADPH) was rather low (Table 3). To investigate the interaction with NADPH in more detail, the reductive half-reaction of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was studied by anaerobic stopped-flow experiments. In the absence of 4-hydroxybenzoate, the rate of reduction of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase by NADPH was extremely slow (k:d = 0.002 s-' at 1 mM NADPH) and in the same range as wild type (Eschrich et al., 1993). Reduction of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was highly stimulated in the presence of 4-hydroxybenzoate, acting as an effector. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the rate of reduction of substrate-complexed [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was dependent both on temperature and the concentration of NADPH. Table 4 shows that under the conditions used, the maximum rate of reduction of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was about five times slower than wild type. From Table 4 it is also evident that Arg44 plays an important role in NADPH binding. At both temperatures studied, the dissociation constant for NADPH in the ternary complex of the mutant was strongly increased with respect to wild type, making [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase a rather inefficient reductase. The reductive half-reaction of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is assumed to involve the following sequence of events (Husain and Massey, 1979): E,,S

pH 8.0. For kinetic reasons (Howell et al., 1972; Husain and Massey, 1979), charge-transfer complex formation was studied at 6°C. In contrast to wild-type (Husain and Massey, 1979), no long-wavelength absorption was observed with [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase at pH 6.6, presumably due to the slow rate of flavin reduction (kied = 1 s-' at 1 mM NADPH) and the very weak binding of NADPH. Fig. 6 compares typical reaction traces for the reduction of wild-type and [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase at pH 8.0. With both enzymes, maximal charge-transfer absorption was observed at 690 nm. The intensity of charge-transfer absorbance was lower for [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (Fig. 6B) than for wild-type (Fig. 6A) and strongly dependent upon the concentration of NADPH. Using the rate and dissociation constants obtained from flavin reduction at 450 nm (Table 4), the 690 nm trace of wild type depicted in Fig. 6A is well simulated with the model presented in Eqn (2). From this simulation (Fig. 6A) it is concluded that both E,,S-NADPH (E,,, = 0.45 mM-' cm-l) and E,,S-NADP' (E,,, = 1.5 mM-' cm-') contribute to the charge-transfer absorption. As can be seen from Table 4, the simulation predicts that at pH 8.0 and 6"C, NADP' release (k,) is much slower than flavin reduction (k2) and most probably rate limiting in overall catalysis (Table 3). A similar conclusion was drawn for wild type, when reacted at pH 7.6 and 2°C (Howell et al., 1972; Entsch and Ballou, 1989). For [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, the very low yield of 690-nm charge-transfer absorption (Fig. 6 B) complicates the evaluation of the kinetics of the reductive half-reaction. Nevertheless, if it assumed that the molar absorption coefficients of E,,S-NADPH and Ere$-NADP' are comparable to wild type, the 690-nm trace depicted in Fig. 6 B can be satisfactorily simulated with the model presented in Eqn (2). With this simulation (Fig. 6B) and considering the rate of reduction determined at 450 nm, an optimal fit was obtained with k, of 14 s-' and k, of 50 SKI. This suggests that the low yield of charge-transfer absorption observed is in part due to a relatively rapid decomposition of the E,,,S-NADP' species. From this it is tentatively concluded that at pH 8.0 and 6"C, reduction of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is rate limiting in catalysis.

DISCUSSION
Arg44 in 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is situated in a short loop which adjoins the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD (Schreuder et al., 1989). The conserved nature of this loop (Entsch et al., 1988; Di Marco et al., 1993; Shuman and Dix, 1993; Wong et al., 1994) and its interaction with both the substrate and the FAD (Schreuder et al., 1989) suggest that this loop plays a functional role in catalysis. This assumption is corroborated by recent crystallographic data which show that the flavin ring in 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase can attain dif-

nicotinamide rings allowing the rapid transfer of a hydride equivalent (Palfey et al., 1994). Anaerobic reduction of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoate involves long-wavelength absorbance changes when the reaction is performed at

The experiments were performed at 6°C in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The final reaction mixture contained 30 pM enzyme, 1 mM 4hydroxybenzoate, 1 mM NADPH in 100 mM Trislsulfate, pH 8.0. Enzyme reduction and formation of charge-transfer absorption were monitored at 450 nm and 690 nm, respectively. (A) wild-type; (B) [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase.

ferent conformations (Schreuder et al., 1994; Gatti et al., 1994; van Berkel et al., 1994). Flavin motion towards a more solventaccessible region is assumed to provide a path for the substrate to enter the active site and for the product to leave (Schreuder et al., 1994; Gatti et al., 1994). Arg44 may facilitate flavin motion by stabilizing the flavin `out' conformation through n-n stacking interactions (Schreuder et al., 1994). Studies with arabinoflavin containing 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase have indicated that flavin motion may also be important for the efficient reduction of the enzyme/substrate complex by NADPH (van Berkel et al., 1994). The data presented in this study show that Lys replacement of Arg44 does not change the overall folding of the enzyme/ substrate complex. Except for local changes around the site of mutation, no structural differences are observed with respect to wild type. Lys replacement of Arg44 decreased the affinity for the FAD. From the structural data it is apparent that this is due

to the weak interaction of the Lys44 side chain with its ribitylphosphate moiety. Disruption of this interaction does not influence the conformation of the flavin ring. As with wild-type (Schreuder et al., 1989), the flavin ring occupies the interior position in the active site, which is the expected conformation to allow substrate hydroxylation (Schreuder et al., 1994). The observed flipping of the Ile43-Lys44 peptide does not seem to contribute to the stabilization of the flavin `in' position because all H-bond interactions remain virtually unaltered. [R44K]4-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase tightly couples ffavin reduction to substrate hydroxylation. The efficient production of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate by [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is in agreement with the flavin `in' conformation observed in the crystal structure. As discussed elsewhere (Schreuder et al., 1990; Entsch and van Berkel, 1995), the flavin `in' conformation is needed for the stabilization of the flavin(C4a)-hydroperoxide and for its correct orientation towards the

164

substrate. Lys replacement of Arg44 hardly influences the orientation of the substrate. Despite this, the mutation changes the absorption properties of protein-bound substrate indicating some disturbance of the hydrogen-bond network connecting the phenolic moiety of the substrate with the side chains of Tyr201 and Tyr385. The crystal structures do not show significant changes, indicating that these perturbations must be small. In analogy with mutant Tyr385Phe (Eschrich et al., 1993), the changed electronic properties of the substrate do not preclude efficient hydroxylation. The most intriguing result from the present study is that Lys replacement of Arg44 substantially alters the binding kinetics of the reductive half-reaction. The rather high rate of reduction of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexed with 4-hydroxybenzoate suggests that this change in binding kinetics is not related to the effector role of the substrate. This is in accordance with the conserved mode of substrate binding observed in the crystal structure. Inefficient catalysis by Arg44Lys is mainly due to the strongly increased dissociation constant for NADPH in the ternary complex. It is not clear from the present kinetic data whether this increase in KdNADPH reflects a change in the NADPH association-rate or dissociation-rate constant, or both. The binding mode of the NADPH molecule is unknown and it is therefore difficult to assess the exact role of Arg44 in this process. There are, however, a few possibilities. The side chain of Arg44 is located in the cleft leading towards the active site and the residue might be directly involved in NADPH binding of e.g., the ADP part of the molecule. Reduction of 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is influenced by movement of the flavin ring in and out of the active site. 4-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, reconstituted with arabino-FAD binds the flavin in the out position (van Berkel et al., 1994) and is more rapidly reduced by NADPH than wild type. The mutation of Arg44 to Lys could lead to reduced stabilization of the flavin out conformation because of the absence of Z-TCstacking interactions, leading to less efficient reduction. The Arg44Lys mutation could lead to a change in the mutual orientation of the flavin and nicotinamide rings, inhibiting hydride transfer. The low intensity of the reduced flavin-NADP' charge-transfer species can be explained by poor binding of the NADPHMADP' species, leading to kinetic destabilization, or by a change in the mutual orientation of the flavin and nicotinamide rings, leading to decreased orbital overlap. For wild-type 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in catalysis appears to vary with the reaction conditions. At pH 6.6 and low temperature, flavin reoxidation is largely responsible for determining the rate of catalysis (Husain and Massey, 1979; Entsch and van Berkel, 1995). Under optimal reaction conditions (pH 8.0, 25"C), catalysis is too fast for a clear separation of the individual reaction steps. Molecular orbital calculations suggest that under these conditions, the ratelimiting step in catalysis is dictated by the rate of substrate hydroxylation (Vervoort et al., 1992). The results presented here suggest that at pH 8.0 and 6"C, neither substrate hydroxylation or flavin reoxidation are rate limiting in catalysis, but that the overall reaction rate is dictated by the rate of NADP' release. It is noteworthy that in contrast to wild type (van Berkel and Miiller, 1989), the turnover rate of [R44K]4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase did not increase upon raising the temperature to 25 "C.
