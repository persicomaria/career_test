Introduction
Nearly 20% of all transcriptional regulators identified by bacterial genome analysis are LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs), the largest regulatory family in prokaryotes (Pareja et al., 2006). Despite this prevalence, the molecular basis of effector-induced activation by LTTRs remains unclear. Aggregation problems impede structural studies, and there are only two known atomiclevel structures of LTTRs bound to their cognate inducers (Ezezika et al., 2007a). These structures encompass the effector-binding domains (EBDs) of CatM and BenM, two similar LTTRs that control benzoate degradation in the soil bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (Fig. 1) (RomeroArroyo et al., 1995; Collier et al., 1998). BenM- and CatMEBD both bind an inducer in an interdomain cleft. Surprisingly, a secondary effector-binding site was discovered in a hydrophobic pocket of BenM-EBD. In the current investigation, the physiological significance of this discovery was tested. LTTR­inducer interactions were explored further by characterizing mutants with atypical responses to effectors. In LTTRs, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain is linked to the EBD, which extends to the C-terminus and is composed of two subdomains. The characterized structures of one full-length LTTR and the regulatory regions of several others demonstrate that the protein fold of the EBD is essentially that of a periplasmic-binding protein (Quiocho and Ledvina, 1996; Choi et al., 2001; Muraoka et al., 2003; Smirnova et al., 2004; Stec et al., 2006). The structural conservation in this domain is remarkable in light of the sequence variability in different LTTRs. For example, the structurally similar EBDs of BenM and CysB share only 12% sequence identity (Tyrrell et al., 1997; Verschueren et al., 1999). Consistent with the typical role of the EBD in binding a low-molecular-weight inducer, LTTRs that respond to the same or similar compounds share a higher degree of sequence similarity. CatM and BenM, which are 59% identical in sequence, both respond to the metabolite cis,cis-muconate (hereafter called muconate; Fig. 1) (Romero-Arroyo et al., 1995; Collier et al., 1998). These two LTTRs have overlapping roles in a complex regulon for aromatic compound degradation. A distinguishing characteristic of BenM is its additional ability to recognize benzoate as an inducer. At

Summary
BenM and CatM control transcription of a complex regulon for aromatic compound degradation. These Acinetobacter baylyi paralogues belong to the largest family of prokaryotic transcriptional regulators, the LysR-type proteins. Whereas BenM activates transcription synergistically in response to two effectors, benzoate and cis,cis-muconate, CatM responds only to cis,cis-muconate. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the physiological significance of an unexpected benzoate-binding pocket in BenM discovered during structural studies. Residues in BenM were changed to match those of CatM in this hydrophobic pocket. Two BenM residues, R160 and Y293, were found to mediate the response to benzoate. Additionally, alteration of these residues caused benzoate to inhibit activation by cis,cismuconate, positioned in a separate primary effectorbinding site of BenM. The location of the primary site, in an interdomain cleft, is conserved in diverse LysRtype regulators. To improve understanding of this important family, additional regulatory mutants were analysed. The atomic-level structures were characterized of the effector-binding domains of variants that do not require inducers for activation, CatM(R156H) and BenM(R156H,T157S). These structures clearly resemble those of the wild-type proteins in their activated muconate-bound complexes. Amino acid replacements that enable activation without effectors reside at protein interfaces that may impact transcription through effects on oligomerization.

Fig. 1. Pathway for the degradation of benzoate and anthranilate. LysR-type regulators, BenM and CatM, control expression from multiple promoters (numbered 1­4) in a supraoperonic cluster of chromosomal genes. At two loci (1 and 3), BenM and CatM play equally important regulatory roles. At two loci (2 and 4), one regulator is primarily responsible for gene expression (BenM or CatM respectively). The benPK operon encodes transport proteins (Clark et al., 2002). The antABC genes reside in a distant region of the chromosome and are not regulated by BenM or CatM (Bundy et al., 1998).

the promoter of the benABCDE operon, BenM activates gene expression in response to either benzoate or muconate. When present together, the two compounds have a synergistic effect on transcriptional activation (Bundy et al., 2002). This unusual type of synergism enables the bacterium to integrate multiple metabolic signals rapidly and to prevent the buildup of toxic intermediates during benzoate consumption. Synergism may depend on changes to the electrostatic environment of muconate, housed in the primary effectorbinding site, when benzoate binds the secondary site (Fig. 2; Ezezika et al., 2007a; Craven et al., 2008). This regulatory model derives from the analysis of BenM-EBD crystals soaked in high, non-physiological concentrations of benzoate (120 mM) (Ezezika et al., 2007a). However, the structural studies do not reveal whether benzoate

occupies the secondary site in vivo nor which interactions are critical for benzoate-dependent transcription. In the BenM-EBD structure, benzoate in the secondary site contacts arginine 160 and tyrosine 293 (Fig. 2B). Although CatM does not respond to benzoate, its comparable region is substantially conserved except for residues 160 and 293. As described herein, these amino acids in BenM were altered to prevent benzoate binding. The effects on growth and expression were used to assess how benzoate regulates transcription. Some of the resulting mutants failed to grow on benzoate, and spontaneous mutations were identified that restore this ability. Results were interpreted in light of the hypothesis that benzoate mediates transcriptional synergism by binding to the secondary site and altering interactions among charged residues at positions 160, 162 and 146 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, arginine 156 of BenM was replaced with histidine. This variant was generated to resemble CatM(R156H), a regulator that activates transcription from the catA and catB promoters without an inducer (Neidle et al., 1989; Ezezika et al., 2006). This replacement, in the central portion of the EBD, is not directly adjacent to either of the structurally identified effector-binding sites. To help determine the role of this residue in mediating the response to inducers, protein structures were characterized by X-ray crystallographic methods. Here we report the structures of CatM(R156H)-EBD and BenM(R156H,T157S)-EBD and discuss conformational changes involved in transcriptional activation by LTTRs.

Results
Testing the role of R160 and Y293 of BenM in benzoate-dependent transcriptional activation Replacements were engineered in two BenM residues predicted to mediate benzoate binding (Fig. 2B). Regulatory changes were expected to affect growth characteristics, because growth on benzoate requires BenMFig. 2. Representations of the BenM-EBD structure (PDB 2F7A). A BenM-EBD subunit, in ribbon representation, shows the inducers muconate and benzoate (BEN) bound in the primary and secondary effector-binding sites respectively (A). In the region of the secondary effector-binding site, Arg160 and Tyr293 make direct contact with a bound benzoate molecule (B). A model for electrostatic control of synergism entails communication of the binding of benzoate via interactions among Arg160, Glu162 and Arg146, a residue near muconate (Ezezika et al., 2007a). Residues 160 and 293 differ in CatM, which has histidine and phenylalanine at these positions respectively.

activated ben-gene expression (locus 2, Fig. 1) and highlevel expression of the cat-genes. These latter genes (loci 3 and 4, Fig. 1) can be sufficiently regulated by CatM without BenM to allow growth on anthranilate or muconate. Plasmid pBAC713 (Table 1), encoding BenM(R160H,Y293F), generates a secondary effectorbinding region that should resemble that of CatM, which does not respond to benzoate. DNA from pBAC713 replaced the wild-type chromosomal benM to generate strain ACN641 (Table 1). ACN641 was able to grow with muconate or anthranilate but not benzoate as a sole carbon source (Fig. 1). To confirm the inference that bengene expression was low, a benA::lacZ transcriptional fusion replaced benA on the ACN641 chromosome, generating ACN661 (Table 1). LacZ activity was measured in ACN661 and ACN32, a comparable strain with wild-type benM (Fig. 3). The disruption of benA prevents further benzoate metabolism and allows its effects as an inducer to be examined. Whereas benzoate induced a 12-fold increase in gene expression in ACN32, benzoatedependent benA expression was abolished in ACN661 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, muconate increased benA::lacZ expression 18-fold in ACN661 (Fig. 3B). Although this muconate-inducible expression is lower than with wildtype BenM (ACN32), it remains higher than in the absence of BenM (ACN47) (Fig. 3B). In the latter strain, CatM mediates a low level of muconate-inducible benA expression (Collier et al., 1998). Collectively, these results indicate BenM(R160H,Y293F) activates benA expression in response to muconate but not benzoate. Without activation in response to benzoate, it is not surprising that the synergistic effect of both inducers, seen in ACN32, was also lost in ACN661. Interestingly, when both effectors were added to ACN661, benzoate inhibited muconateactivated benA expression (Fig. 3B). Individual amino acid replacements at positions 160 and 293 in BenM Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create BenM variants with either R160H or Y293F. Using allelic exchange methods, benM on the chromosome was replaced with plasmid-borne alleles. The individual amino acid replacements had similar effects to the double replacement. ACN795 and ACN824 encoding BenM(R160H) or BenM(Y293F) did not grow on benzoate. Moreover, there was no benzoate-activated benA expression in strains with a chromosomal lacZ transcriptional fusion (ACN796 and ACN826, Fig. 3A). In ACN826, the muconate-induced benA expression, mediated by BenM(Y293F), was strongly inhibited by benzoate (Fig. 3B). As muconateinduced benA expression in ACN796 was not significantly higher than in the absence of BenM (in ACN47), the BenM(R160H) protein may not be stably produced. Nev-

ertheless, the inhibition of muconate-activated expression in ACN796 but not ACN47 may indicate that benA in the former strain is regulated by BenM(R160H), albeit at a low level. To investigate position 160 in BenM further, arginine was replaced with lysine or methionine, amino acids of similar charge or size to the wild-type residue. The resulting strains, ACN810 and ACN812, which encode BenM(R160K) or BenM(R160M), respectively, failed to grow on benzoate. In the corresponding strains with a chromosomal benA::lacZ reporter (ACN811 and ACN813), gene expression indicates that both BenM variants activate transcription in response to muconate but not benzoate (Fig. 3B). However, with either replacement at residue 160, muconate-activated benA expression was inhibited by benzoate. BenM(R160M,Y293F) enables growth on benzoate as a sole carbon and energy source Additional variants were made to combine each replacement at position 160 with Y293F. When these benM alleles controlled benA::lacZ expression in ACN659 and ACN660, the double variants, BenM(R160M,Y293F) and BenM(R160K,Y293F), showed similar expression patterns to their single replacement counterparts (Fig. 3). However, unlike the other mutants, ACN639, encoding BenM(R160M,Y293F), grew on benzoate as the carbon source, although more slowly and with a longer lag time than the wild type (Table 2). To assess the possibility that ACN639 had acquired additional mutations, plasmidderived benM DNA was used to transform a recipient encoding BenM(R160M) or BenM(Y293F). Growth on benzoate occurred only when recombination could generate an allele encoding BenM(R160M,Y293F) (data not shown). The transformation rates suggested that additional mutations are not needed for growth on benzoate. As the BenM(R160M,Y293F) variant does not respond to benzoate (ACN659, Fig. 3A), it was not obvious how ACN639 expresses benABCDE sufficiently for benzoate consumption. In some mutants lacking BenM, increased levels of muconate-inducible benA expression permit growth on benzoate (Cosper et al., 2000; Ezezika et al., 2006). However, the muconate-dependent expression mediated by BenM(R160M,Y293F) was comparable to that of other variants that do not confer growth on benzoate (Fig. 3B). As these assays used high concentrations of extracellular effectors, conditions were modified to mimic wild-type metabolism more closely. The expression of benA::lacZ was monitored during growth on anthranilate, a substrate that generates intracellular muconate during catabolism (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, BenM(R160M,Y293F) yielded higher benA expression than wild-type BenM or the variants with individual

replacements (Fig. 4). This relatively high expression was most pronounced at early stages in the growth cycle of batch cultures (OD600 ~0.03­0.07). Thus, the early activation of benA expression by BenM(R160M,Y293F) may enable ACN639 to grow on benzoate. This variant may respond to relatively low intracellular concentrations of muconate. Selection of spontaneous mutants that grow on benzoate (ben + phenotype) Mutants ACN640 and ACN641, which do not grow on benzoate, gave rise to spontaneous colonies on benzoate medium. Two such ben+ derivatives, ACN807 and ACN809, were characterized. DNA sequencing confirmed that ACN807 retained the mutations of its parent (ACN640) encoding R160K and Y293F. Similarly, ACN809 retained the mutations of its parent (ACN641) encoding R160H and Y293F. Each strain also had a benM

mutation encoding a third amino acid change, R225H in ACN807 and E226K in ACN809. Gene expression was assessed in strains with a chromosomal benA::lacZ fusion controlled by an adjacent benM allele encoding either BenM(R160K,R225H,Y293F) (ACN828) or BenM(R160H,E226K,Y293F) (ACN829). In both cases, there were high levels of benA expression, with or without the addition of muconate and/or benzoate as inducers (Fig. 5). The R225H and E226K replacements each enabled higher benA expression in the absence of inducer than did muconate-induced wild-type BenM. Transcriptional activation by BenM without inducers To determine the individual effects of R225H or E226K, engineered benM alleles on plasmids pBAC776 and pBAC778 were substituted for the chromosomal benM. Strains ACN864, encoding BenM(R225H), and ACN866, encoding BenM(E226K), grew on benzoate as the carbon source (Table 2). This ben+ phenotype was consistent with having wild-type sequences in the secondary effectorbinding site of BenM. Reporter strains subsequently demonstrated that the replacements at residue 225 or 226 affected gene expression. In ACN865 and ACN867, an allele encoding BenM(R225H) or BenM(E226K), respectively, controlled an adjacent chromosomal benA::lacZ fusion. Both variants activated high-level benA expression without added inducers (Fig. 5). The uninduced expression of benA in ACN867 was 266-fold higher than with wild-type BenM and was not substantially increased by benzoate or muconate. In ACN865, encoding R225H with a wild-type secondary effector-binding site, benzoate alone activated benA expression. In contrast, the same R225H replacement in combination with R160K and Y293F in ACN828 caused inhibition of benA expression when benzoate was provided as the only effector.

To improve understanding of transcriptional activation without inducers, a variant was constructed to resemble a previously studied homologue, CatM(R156H), known to induce CatA and CatB without muconate (Neidle et al., 1989). ACN678 was created with a chromosomal allele that encodes BenM(R156H). This strain grew well with benzoate as the carbon source (Table 2). Another strain, ACN680, was generated in which this allele controlled expression of the benA::lacZ transcriptional fusion. In the absence of inducer, benA expression in ACN680 under the control of BenM(R156H) was 213-fold higher than in ACN32 with wild-type BenM (Fig. 5). The addition of inducers to ACN680 elicited a further increase in gene expression. Structural determination of CatM- and BenM-EBD R156H variant regulators As the R156H replacement affected regulation by CatM and BenM, the variant EBD structures were characterized. In construction of the plasmid to express BenM(R156H), site-directed mutation introduced the desired replacement and an accidental change, T157S. As strains encoding BenM(R156H,T157S) regulated benA similarly to BenM(R156H) (data not shown), the effect of the T157S replacement was inferred to be minimal. X-ray diffraction data were collected for two independent crystal forms of BenM(R156H,T157S)-EBD without effectors. Their structures were assigned Protein Data Bank (PDB) identification codes 2H99 (crystal form A) and 2H9B (crystal Form B). Both crystallized in space group P212121 with similar cell constants and were solved by molecular replacement using the co-ordinates of the previously solved BenM-EBD wild-type structure, PDB 2F7A (Ezezika et al., 2007a). As in previous BenM-EBD structures, two subunits related by non-crystallographic twofold symmetry

were in the asymmetric units of both crystals, although the composition of ordered ions differed between the structures. This difference in ion composition provided the impetus for comparing the two otherwise isomorphous structures. In structure 2H99, an acetate molecule bound in the primary effector-binding site of one subunit (A), while this same position in its second subunit (B) was occupied by chloride and sulphate ions. In structure 2H9B, a sulphate ion was in the primary effector-binding site of one subunit (A), while the other subunit (B) bound a sulphate and a chloride ion. Both crystal forms diffracted to high resolution (approximately 1.85 Å). Details of the data collection and refinement statistics are in Table S1 (Supporting information). In contrast to BenM(R156H)-EBD, CatM(R156H)-EBD was structurally characterized only in the presence of muconate. The variant structure (PDB 3GLB) was determined using the wild-type CatM-EBD structure (PDB 2F7B) as the molecular replacement model (Ezezika et al., 2007a). The CatM(R156H)-EBD structure had four subunits in the asymmetric unit (space group, P21212) arranged as two independent dimeric units. In contrast, the previously determined CatM-EBD structures all had single subunits in the asymmetric units that could create dimers by applying crystallographic twofold operators. Muconate molecules were present in the primary effector binding sites of all the CatM(R156H)-EBD subunits. This variant crystal had a lower resolution limit of (2.8 Å) (Table S1). Assessing structural differences To compare the variant and wild-type EBD structures, individual subunit structures were aligned using invariant core analysis with the program Bio3D (Grant et al., 2006). This analysis was consistent with the two domains of each EBD acting as rigid bodies that flex around a central hinge near residues 162 and 265. In Fig. 2A, this hinge-like region corresponds to the orange and green beta-strands depicted behind muconate. To illustrate the structural effects of the R156H replacements in BenM and CatM, residues from only domain I were aligned using invariant core analysis. The full EBD structures were then overlaid onto the aligned domain I residues. In this fashion, domain II movement could be visualized relative to a fixed domain I (Fig. 6). To evaluate structural differences, the root mean square deviations of residues 90­161 and 267­302 of domain II were calculated between the unliganded BenM-EBD structure (2F6G, subunit A) and the other BenM-EBD structures using domain I-aligned proteins. A similar approach was used for CatM-EBD (residues 90­161 and 267­286). However, the calculated values were difficult to interpret and relatively small (with a maximum value of 1.76 Å), as reported in Tables S2 and S3. The results

were complicated by the different directions of relative movement observed between domain I and domain II in different structures. Therefore, a more sophisticated method of evaluation was needed. To improve the detection of functionally significant changes in the relative positions of the two domains of the EBDs, a domain motion analysis was performed with the program DynDom (Hayward and Berendsen, 1998; Hayward, 1999; Hayward and Lee, 2002). In this analysis, the movement of domain II with respect to a fixed domain I (containing the R156H replacement) was described by the displacement of the rigid body around a defined screw axis with a translation along this axis. Prior to the motion analysis, the individual BenM-EBD subunit structures were superimposed using core invariant residues within domain I. The CatM-EBD structures were similarly aligned and subjected to motion analysis. Domain movement can be evaluated by considering the orientation of the screw axis, as discussed later and shown in Fig. 6B and D for BenM-EBD and CatM-EBD structures respectively.

Discussion
BenM's response to benzoate requires key residues in the secondary effector-binding site This investigation shows that benzoate-activated transcription and dual-effector synergism both depend on a BenM region distinct from the primary effector-binding site. The response to benzoate relies on two residues in a recently discovered secondary effector-binding site (Ezezika et al., 2007a). Individual or double replacements of R160 and Y293 demonstrated the functional significance of this site. While these changes in BenM variants can abolish growth on benzoate and prevent benzoateinduced benA expression (Fig. 3A), the response to muconate was retained and appears to depend on the primary effector-binding site (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the regulatory effects of the primary and secondary effectorbinding sites are interconnected (Fig. 2B). Amino acid replacements designed to prevent benzoate from binding the secondary site caused benzoate to inhibit muconateinduced benA expression (Fig. 3B). Without benzoate in the secondary site, there may be increased competition between benzoate and muconate to bind in the primary site. Such competition is consistent with previous effectorbinding studies and the demonstration that benzoate can bind in the primary site (Clark et al., 2004; Ezezika et al., 2007a). Charge-dependent interactions of residues between the primary and secondary effector-binding sites form the basis of our model for synergism (Ezezika et al., 2007a; Craven et al., 2008). According to this model, benzoate bound in the secondary site enhances the effect of muconate in the primary site due to interaction between

the carboxyl group of benzoate and R160 (Fig. 2). This interaction decreases the attraction between R160 and E162 and enhances the opportunity for interactions between E162 and R146. This latter interaction keeps R146 from shielding the negative charge of the adjacent carboxyl group of muconate, thereby strengthening the attraction between the negatively charged effector and the positive dipole moments of four nearby alpha helices. Therefore, in the presence of benzoate, muconate should be more effective in drawing together the two domains of the EBD into an activated conformation. The R160M and R160K replacements might be expected to affect muconate-induced gene expression differently. Without benzoate in the secondary site, methionine could enhance interaction between E162 and R146 to augment muconate induction in a fashion that mimics the benzoate-R160 contact in wild-type BenM. In contrast, the charge based attraction between K160 and E162 might resemble the effect of the R160 in the absence of benzoate, yielding lower levels of muconateinduced transcription. While R160M was not observed to enhance gene expression to a greater extent than the R160K in cultures grown with high concentrations of extracellular muconate (Fig. 3B), the only variant that allows growth on benzoate as the sole carbon source is BenM(R160M,Y293F). This result suggests that the R160M replacement is better able than R160K to activate muconate-dependent transcription in vivo. Consistent with our regulatory model, R160M could enhance transcription via an increased affinity of the protein for muconate that is physiologically significant at low effector concentrations (Fig. 4). The long lag time of ACN639 suggests that growth is limited by the time needed to generate muconate as an inducer (Table 2). It is not yet clear why the Y293F replacement is also required for growth on benzoate and for the early elevation of benA expression (Fig. 4). Furthermore, it is not evident why the replacements at positions 160 and 293 reduced muconatedependent benA expression relative to wild-type BenM (Fig. 3B). Such observations emphasize the need to investigate structural differences and protein stability in addition to correlating ongoing functional and structural analyses. A full understanding of BenM-activated expression will also require investigations of interactions with DNA and RNA polymerase, because regulation varies at different promoters. For example, BenM activates benPK expression (locus 1, Fig. 1) in response to muconate but not benzoate (Clark et al., 2002). Transcriptional activation without effectors: the importance of protein interfaces in the tetramer Spontaneous mutants revealed the importance of residues 225 and 226. BenM(R225H) and BenM(E226K)

activated high-level benA expression without exogenous inducers (Fig. 5). In BenM-EBD structures, the sidechains of R225 and E226 are adjacent and lie at the centre of the dimer interface on the twofold symmetry axis (Fig. 7C). This axis, present in all our structures, is crystallographic in some cases and non-crystallographic in others. Thus, the R225H and E226K replacements are likely to affect the dimer interface. Supporting this assumption, a comparably positioned residue in Cbl was shown by cross-linking studies to be required for oligomerization (Stec et al., 2006). Residues 225 and 226 are identified in a model of the tetrameric BenM-EBD structure (Fig. 7). Although BenM and CatM did not crystallize as tetramers, the interface between neighbouring subunits (the dimer interface) was common in all our EBD structures (Ezezika et al., 2007a,b). Furthermore, the organization of two BenM-EBD structures (2F8D and 2F97) in their crystal lattices mimicked a biologically active tetramer, as assessed by the remarkable similarity to tetrameric CbnR and DntR structures (Muraoka et al., 2003; Smirnova et al., 2004; Ezezika et al., 2007b). Mutations that cause constitutive activation in other LTTRs, such as OccR and OxyR, have also been predicted to affect the dimerization interface (Choi et al., 2001; Akakura and Winans, 2002). Amino acid replacements may alter the relative orientations of the subunits or the local flexibility of the protein subunits and thereby affect the function of the oligomeric protein. The R225H replacement may favour ionic interactions between neighbouring side-chains of H225 and E125 at the expense of those with E226 (Fig. 7C). At this central location of the dimer interface, both the charge (pKa) and mass differences between arginine and histidine are likely to affect the association properties between adjacent proteins. With the E226K replacement, a hydrogen bond between K226 and E125 might pull the domains together and mimic effector-mediated activation. Without effectors, the BenM(E226K) variant activates maximal levels of transcription that are not significantly enhanced by benzoate or muconate (Fig. 5). This regulation enables ACN866 to grow rapidly on benzoate with a short lag time (Table 2). BenM(R156H) also activates transcription without effectors and allows rapid growth on benzoate (Fig. 5, and Table 2). The importance of R156 was first found in CatM (Neidle et al., 1989; Ezezika et al., 2006). The R156H replacement, which lies at the interface between dimers (the tetramer interface), may weaken the interaction with D264 on the adjacent subunit (Fig. 7A and B). Furthermore, the R156H replacement may alter the loop of residues 148­156 and thereby impact the relationships between subunits of the oligomeric protein. The structure of the variant showed substantial repositioning of lysine at position 148 (Fig. 7B). When H156 is

present, lysine moves into the adjacent pocket normally occupied by the side-chain of arginine. Because the BenM(R156H,T127S)-EBD structures did not pack using the tetrameric interface, we cannot identify the effects on oligomer reorientation. However, as this tetrameric interface was not used for packing in the crystals, alterations in tetramer formation could not have caused the changes observed in the relative positions of the EBD domains in the wild type and the R156H variants (described next). There were fundamental changes in each subunit.

Protein conformations associated with LTTR-activated transcription and ligand binding In LTTRs, effectors are predicted to bring the EBD domains together by binding between them (Ezezika et al., 2007a). Muconate in the primary site of BenM-EBD (green) resulted in a downward tilting of the right side of domain II towards domain I compared with the structure without ligands (grey, Fig. 6A). Similarly, both domains of the variant (magenta) are drawn together despite the absence of muconate (Fig. 6A). Even without the context of the functional tetramer, the variant EBD appears to assume a conformation similar to the inducer-bound wild type. As the variant contains chloride and sulphate ions in the primary effector-binding site, BenM(R156H) may activate transcription non-specifically in response to bound anions. Structural comparisons were complex, and domain movement was not limited to rotation about a hinge. Motion analysis was used to determine the position of a screw axis to describe simultaneous rotational and translational movements of domain II given a fixed position of domain I, using the regulator without ligands as a reference (Fig. 6B). The movement of domain II towards domain I can be visualized using a right-hand rule with the thumb pointing in the direction of the arrow (translation) such that the fingers curl around in the direction of rotation.

The position of an axis representing simple rotation about an interdomain hinge is best matched by the wildtype structure with muconate and benzoate bound in the primary and secondary effector sites respectively (2F7A-B, Fig. 6B). In this inducer-bound structure, domain II rotates 5.5° with minimal translation (0.21 Å) about an axis that passes through domain II near residues 161 and 267 (Fig. 6B). The movement parameters for all our structures are given in Tables S2 and S3. The BenM(R156H,T157S)-EBD variants deviated from a perfect hinge motion to a greater extent than the inducerbound wild-type regulator. For each variant subunit, the position of its screw axis depended on the particular ions in its primary effector-binding site (Table S2). For the structures with both chloride and sulphate ions in this site, 2H99-B (Fig. 6B) and 2H9B-B (Fig. S1), the rigid-body motion of domain II is skewed towards the location of the R156H replacement. While the significance of this twist is unknown, the R156H variants were more akin to the wildtype structure bound to muconate than to those that lacked this inducer. This conclusion is supported by assessment of the screw axis vectors and other displacement values (such as the distances between the screw axis and the line joining the centres of mass). Thus, the rigid-body motion of the domains in the BenM(R156H,T157S)-EBD variant imitated the conformational changes that typically occur upon muconate binding. The movement analysis for CatM-EBD was more complicated. First, the wild-type structure (2F7B) contained sulphate and chloride ions in the primary effectorbinding site that appeared to draw the EBD domains together in a partially closed form intermediate between the BenM-EBD structures with and without inducers (2F7A-B and 2F6G-A respectively). Second, we were only able to obtain data for muconate-bound CatM(R156H)EBD. Nevertheless, the comparisons were informative. The EBD domains of the variant structure (magenta) were closer together when clamping down on muconate than even the inducer-bound wild type (green, Fig. 6C). As muconate-dependent induction by this R156H variant is higher than for wild-type CatM (Neidle et al., 1989), our data support the model that a transcriptionally active regulator has a conformation in which the two EBD domains are drawn together. Although the conformational change within each protein subunit may appear to be subtle, the propagation of small changes can result in substantial changes within the tetramer (Ezezika et al., 2007a). The screw axes of the CatM(R156H)-EBD structures (3GLB, subunits A, C and D) show that relative to the wild-type structures, domain II is rotated more prevalently towards the R156H replacement (Fig. 6D and Supporting information). Subunit B of the CatM(R156H)-EBD structure displays the most exaggerated rotation towards the

replacement (see Supporting information). A sulphate ion, unique to this subunit, may bridge His160 and His297 and distort the conformation. Overall, in the structures of both BenM(R156H,T157S) and CatM (R156H), the rigid-body domain motions resemble those of the muconate-bound wild-type proteins, but with a slight turn to bring domain II towards residue 156. Such a change most likely affects the relative orientations of these domains in the formation of the functional oligomeric proteins.

Dual-effector synergism and relevance to the widespread LTTR family Although BenM is the only regulator in which distinct effector-binding sites and transcriptional synergism are known, there are likely to be related examples of multieffector transcriptional control. A database search revealed approximately 60 BenM-like homologues in which key residues in the secondary effector-binding pocket were conserved (data not shown). Completely conserved residues included R146, R160 and E162, which may mediate transcriptional synergism, as well as R160 and Y293, which may interact with a ligand. These putative regulators also contained conserved residues in a pocket resembling the muconate-binding primary effector-binding site of BenM and CatM. These homologues were identified in diverse bacteria including different species of Burholderia, Ralstonia, Psychrobacter, Polaromonas, Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Bordatella, Xanthobacter, Paracoccus and Acinetobacter. The study of a BenM homologue from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus PHEA2, 84% identical to that of ADP1, did not identify synergism (Zhan et al., 2008). However, this investigation did not assess the uptake of compounds added as inducers or whether they were metabolized. Thus, some questions remain about these conclusions. The effector responses of many LTTRs involved in aromatic compound degradation have proven difficult to study. Nevertheless, the potential use of such regulators for purposes such as biosensing and bioengineering are driving efforts to create regulators with increased sensitivity to specific inducers and/or more varied effectorbinding profiles (Cebolla et al., 1997; 2001; Smirnova et al., 2004; Lonneborg et al., 2007). Our structurefunction studies of BenM and CatM may be helpful in extending such biotechnology applications for the LTTR family.

Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Acinetobacter baylyi strains (Table 1) and Escherichia coli were grown in Luria­Bertani (LB) broth at 37°C with shaking

(300 r.p.m.) (Sambrook et al., 1989). Alternatively, A. baylyi was grown in minimal medium with succinate (10 mM), anthranilate (2 mM), benzoate (2 mM), or muconate (2 mM) as the carbon source (Shanley et al., 1986). E. coli DH5a (Invitrogen) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene) were used as plasmid hosts. Antibiotics were added, as needed, to the following concentrations: ampicillin, 150 mg ml-1; kanamycin, streptomycin, 13 mg ml-1; spectinomycin, 25 mg ml-1; 13 mg ml-1. For A. baylyi growth curves, succinate-grown colonies were used to inoculate 5 ml cultures. After overnight growth on benzoate, 1 ml was used to inoculate 100 ml of benzoate medium. Growth was assessed by turbidity and measured spectrophotometrically (OD600).

Transformation assay used to confirm the ben + growth phenotype of ACN639
To assess the ben+ phenotype of ACN639, transformation assays were performed. ACN824, encoding the Y293F replacement, was used as the recipient with donor DNA from plasmids. pBAC711, pBAC771 and pBAC772 were linearized by digestion with XhoI, and pBAC780 with EcoRI, before being used to transform ACN824 (Table 1). The same transformations were done using ACN812, encoding BenM(R160M), as the recipient strain. Transformants grew on benzoate only when an allele could be generated to encode BenM(R160M,Y293F).

Site-specificic mutagenesis of benM and generation of A. baylyi strains via allelic exchange
Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid-borne benM (QuikChange, Stratagene) was used to encode desired amino acids. Template plasmids, pBAC7 or pBAC433, were used in PCR reactions with mutagenic primers (Table S4). DpnI-treated PCR products were transformed into XL1-Blue cells, and plasmid-containing colonies were selected. DNA sequencing confirmed nucleotide substitutions on plasmids. Plasmid-borne alleles were used to replace chromosomal genes (Collier et al., 1998). To aid the introduction of altered benM DNA, a counter-selectable marker disrupted chromosomal benM. Plasmid pBAC709 was made by ligating the ~3.65 kb sacB::Kmr cassette from PRMJ1 (Jones and Williams, 2003) into the SalI site of benM on pBAC11. pBAC709 was linearized with AlwN1 and used to transform ADP1, generating ACN637. To replace the chromosomal sacB marker with modified benM alleles, appropriate plasmids were linearized with XhoI or PvuII and used to transform ACN637. Desired transformants were selected by growth at 30°C in the presence of 5% sucrose. In resulting strains, the chromosomal benM was PCR amplified and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Expression and purification of BenM- and CatM-EBD variants
The EBDs of BenM(R156H,T157S) and CatM(R156H) were purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold cells (Stratagene) harbouring expression plasmids pBAC698 or pBAC683 respectively. For expression, E. coli cultures were grown at 37°C to an OD600 of ~0.2 at which time isopropyl-b-Dthiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mM) was added for induction. Cells were harvested after overnight growth and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.9) at 4°C. Cells were lysed by French Press (15 000 psi) at 4°C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min at 4°C and the clarified cell extract was applied to a Hi-Trap 5 ml metal chelating column (GE Biosciences) charged with nickel. Purified BenM(R156H,T157S)EBD samples were dialysed twice against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and concentrated to ~14 mg ml-1. Purified CatM(R156H)-EBD was dialysed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM imidazole (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Imidazole and glycerol were added to increase protein solubility.

Crystallization and X-ray analyses b-Galactosidase assays to measure benA::lacZ expression
A benA::lacZ transcriptional fusion was introduced into the chromosome of A. baylyi strains by allelic exchange with DNA from pBAC54 linearized with XmnI. Unless otherwise noted, strains were grown overnight in LB with kanamycin. The following day, strains were subcultured into LB with no inducer or the following: benzoate (1 mM), muconate (1 mM) or both (0.5 mM each). Cell density was measured at 600 nm, and LacZ activity was assayed when cultures entered stationary phase (Miller, 1972). Using the FlourAce b-galactosidase reporter kit (Bio-Rad), the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-galactopyranoside to the product 4methylumbelliferone was detected with a TD-360 minifluorometer. For assays during growth on anthranilate, cultures were first grown overnight in 5 ml LB with kanamycin. The following morning, 100 ml of each culture was diluted into 5 ml of minimal medium with 1 mM anthranilate as the sole carbon source. LacZ activity was measured at specific times following inoculation. Initial high-throughput crystallization screens at the Hauptman-Woodward Institute used microbatch under oil methods at 298K (Luft et al., 2001). Screens were done with and without benzoate and/or muconate (100 mM) in the protein solution. Conditions yielding crystals were optimized in-house with the microbatch under oil method at 15°C or 25°C with 2 ml protein and 2 ml precipitant. Two conditions produced BenM(R156H,T157S)-EBD crystals. Crystal Form A came from a precipitant solution of 0.015 M magnesium acetate, 0.05 M sodium cacodylate, 1.7 M ammonium sulphate, pH 6.0; and Crystal Form B was derived from 2.0 M ammonium sulphate as precipitant. CatM(R156H) crystals grew from a precipitant of 1.6 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M citric acid, pH 4.0 with 100 mM muconate (from a 500 mM, pH 7.0 stock solution). Protein samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16 000 g and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before crystallization trials. Crystals for X-ray diffraction studies grew within 1­2 weeks. Diffraction data for BenM(R156H,T157S)and CatM(R156H)-EBD were collected at the South-east Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) at the 22-ID

and 22-BM beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, Il with 0.5° oscillations and wavelength of 1.0 Å. Data were processed with beamline versions of HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Structures were determined as before (Ezezika et al., 2007a,b) by molecular replacement using MOLREP in the CCP4 suite (1994) with known EBD co-ordinates (PDB accession 2F6G and 2F7A for the BenM variant and 2F7B and 2F7C for the CatM variant) as search models. COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) was used to adjust local differences in the structures, and atomic refinement performed with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). Refinement of the four non-crystallographically related subunits of CatM(R156H) used medium NCS restraints on four groups defined by residues 90­155, 157­219, 221­275 and 277­296. Residues 297­307 at the C-termini were ordered to different degrees in each subunit and assumed several conformations. Data collection and refinement statistics are in Supporting information. Invariant core residues were identified and aligned in the program Bio3d (Grant et al., 2006) with a 0.5 Å3 core cut-off. Atomic co-ordinates were aligned with different combinations of structures and subsets: full EBD subunits, domain I alone, domain II alone (residues), and as separate homologues or together. The overall root mean square (rms) deviations of the domain I residues were small (~0.6­1.2 Å) and not substantially increased in the local regions of the replacements in variant structures. For graphical representations, BenMEBDs were aligned on core residues from domain I (91­98, 100­109, 111­112, 121­127, 130­146, 154­60,268­274 and 281­293). CatM-EBDs were aligned on core residues (91­ 123, 125, 127­146, 154­154, 156­161, 268­274, 277­277, 279­293 and 295­295). The molecular graphics program PYMOL (DeLano, 2002) was used for visualization, figure preparation and rms calculations of aligned molecules. Domain motions were evaluated using the Domain Select option of web-based Protein Domain Motion Analysis program DynDom (Hayward and Berendsen, 1998; Hayward and Lee, 2002). For domain analysis, the pre-aligned subunits from invariant core analysis were truncated at the N(residue 90) and C-termini (residue 302 for BenM, residue 296 for CatM), alternative side-chain conformations were removed, and the subunits were entered with domain I as the fixed domain (for BenM, residues 90­161 and 267­302; for CatM, residues 90­161 and 267­286) and domain II (residues 162­266) as the moving domain. Screw axes were visualized as CGI objects by reformatting the Rasmol (Sayle and Milner-White, 1995) output of the DynDom program for visualization in the program PYMOL (DeLano, 2002). Screw axis vectors and centre points were similarly calculated using a python script with data from the Rasmol output.
