Abstract In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium about 80% of the dUMP used for dTMP synthesis is derived from deamination of dCTP. The dCTP deaminase produces dUTP that subsequently is hydrolyzed by dUTPase to dUMP and diphosphate. The dCTP deaminase is regulated by dTTP that inhibits the enzyme by binding to the active site and induces an inactive conformation of the trimeric enzyme. We have analyzed the role of residues previously suggested to play a role in catalysis. The mutant enzymes R115Q, S111C, S111T and E138D were all purified and analyzed for activity. Only S111T and E138D displayed detectable activity with a 30- and 140-fold reduction in kcat, respectively. Furthermore, S111T and E138D both showed altered dTTP inhibition compared to wild-type enzyme. S111T was almost insensitive to the presence of dTTP. With the E138D enzyme the dTTP dependent increase in cooperativity of dCTP saturation was absent, although the dTTP inhibition itself was still cooperative. Modeling of the active site of the S111T enzyme indicated that this enzyme is restricted in forming the inactive dTTP binding conformer due to steric hindrance by the additional methyl group in threonine. The crystal structure of E138D in complex with dUTP showed a hydrogen bonding network in the active site similar to wild-type enzyme. However, changes in the hydrogen bond lengths between the carboxylate and a catalytic water molecule as well as a slightly different orientation of the pyrimidine ring of the bound nucleotide may provide an explanation for the reduced activity.

The dUDP supplied by the ribonucleotide reductase constitutes only a minor source of dUMP required for dTMP synthesis in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In both types of organisms the main supply of dUMP appears to come from the deamination of a cytosine deoxyribonucleotide [1­3]. In eukaryotes and most Gram-positive bacteria the deamination of dCMP is catalyzed by dCMP deaminase, an enzyme allosterically regulated by dCTP (activator) and dTTP (inhibitor) [4­6]. In other prokaryotes, dCTP deaminase catalyses the conversion of dCTP to dUTP [7,8], which is subsequently hydrolyzed to dUMP

and diphosphate by dUTPase, or as shown in archaea, dUMP may be formed directly by the bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase [9,10]. The dCTP deaminase, the trimeric dUTPase and the bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase constitute a family of structurally closely related enzymes [11]. They all form homotrimers where the core structure of the subunits may be superimposed and the bifunctional enzyme shares active site residues with both of the monofunctional family members. However, only the dCTP deaminase and the bifunctional enzyme are subjected to regulation by dTTP [8,9,12]. We have previously published the crystal structure of the dCTP deaminase from Escherichia coli and a mutant enzyme, E138A, in complex with dUTP and dCTP [11]. Recently, we have also shown that dTTP inhibits the enzyme by binding to the active site but also by stabilizing

an inactive form of dCTP deaminase through a concerted mechanism that coordinates the conformation of all three active sites in the trimer [12]. In this work we have addressed the role of selected active site residues in dCTP deaminase by mutational analysis, residues that we have previously suggested to play a role in catalyzing the deamination of dCTP [11]. The dCTP deaminase active site is quite unique in that no metal ion participates in the reaction to activate the hydrolyzing water molecule in contrast to the dCMP- [2], cytidine[13,14] and cytosine-deaminase [15,16] that are all structurally closely related [17]. In the active site of dCTP deaminase a glutamate residue, Glu138, serves as the catalytic acid/base. The change of Glu138 to an alanine residue renders the enzyme inactive, but the binding of nucleotide (dCTP or dUTP) is very similar to what is observed for the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, the E138A mutant enzyme has served as a model for structural studies of protein­ligand interactions [11]. The side chains of Ser111 and Arg115 in the active site of E. coli dCTP deaminase interact via hydrogen bonds. These two amino acid residues are together with the main chain carbonyl of Ala124 suggested to stabilize the hydroxide formed by extraction of a proton from the catalytic water molecule by Glu138 [11]. Here we report an analysis of the mutant enzymes S111C, S111T, R115Q and E138D that aimed to establish the role of these residues in the active site of dCTP deaminase by investigating the structural and reaction kinetic effects of these side chain replacements. Interestingly, this analysis also provided additional evidence for the recently suggested mechanism of dTTP inhibition [12].
Experimental procedures Materials
Unless otherwise is stated, all buffers, nucleotides and salts were obtained from Sigma­Aldrich. Radioactive nucleotides were obtained as ammonium salts from Amersham Biosciences. Thin-layer chromatography was performed with poly-ethylene-imine coated cellulose plates from Merck.

type and mutant proteins were produced and purified as previously described [11].

Enzyme kinetics and equilibrium ligand binding
Initial velocities were recorded at 37 °C as described in detail previously [9,12]. Thin-layer chromatography and subsequent liquid scintillation counting was used to first separate and thereafter quantify [5-3H] dUTP produced from [5-3H] dCTP. Assays were performed over a time period of 5 minutes at two enzyme concentrations. In addition to varying concentrations of the nucleotides dCTP and dTTP as shown under results, the incubations contained in 50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM DTT. Incubations for equilibrium binding experiments contained 50­100 lM protein, 50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 2 mM MgCl2 and between 0 and 320 lM of [methyl-3H] dTTP or [5-3H] dCTP. Free nucleotide was separated from bound using Amicon Ultrafree-MC 30.000 NMWL centrifugal filter devices as described previously [12,18,19]. Samples representing free and total radioactive nucleotide were applied to thin-layer chromatography plates and washed by chromatographing in 1 M acetic acid. Finally, radioactivity in the samples was quantified by liquid scintillation as above. Data from steady state kinetic- and equilibrium binding experiments were analyzed using the computer program Ultrafit from BioSoft (version 3.0). The equations used were Eq. (1), the Hill equation, for sigmoid saturation curves, Eq. (2) for sigmoid substrate saturation curves and sigmoid competitive inhibition and Eq. (3) for hyperbolic binding of ligands to the enzyme; rate ¼ k cat ½Sn =ðS n þ ½Sn Þ 0:5 rate ¼ k cat ½Sn =ðS n ð1 þ ð½I=I 0:5 Þni Þ þ ½Sn Þ 0:5 N ¼ N max ½L=ðK d þ ½LÞ ð1Þ ð2Þ ð3Þ

where rate is the initial turnover of the enzyme with a maximum of kcat, S0.5 is the concentration of substrate S at half-maximal saturation of the enzyme, I0.5 is the concentration of inhibitor I for half maximal inhibition, n and ni are the Hill coefficients associated with substrate saturation and inhibition, respectively. N is the degree of binding with the dissociation constant Kd of ligand L to the enzyme with the maximal number of binding sites, Nmax.

Crystallization of the E138D mutant protein
A protein solution of 2 mg/ml protein mixed with 5 mM dUTP and 20 mM MgSO4 were used in vapor diffusion hanging drop experiments. Small plates appeared after 24 h in drops of 2 ll protein with ligand mixed with 2 ll of reservoir solution (27.5% polyethylene glycol 400, 50 mM MgSO4 and 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5) equilibrated against 500 ll of the reservoir solution at room temperature.

Diffraction data collection Molecular biology and protein methods
The alleles of the dcd gene encoding the mutant E. coli dCTP deaminases E138D, S111T, S111C and R115Q, were constructed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) and the primers: E138D5-3, 5 0 -ATTG TGCTGGACTTCTACAAC-3 0 ; E138D3-5, 5 0 -GTTGTAGAAGTCCA GCACAAT-3 0 ; S111T5-3, 5 0 -GACGGGCGTACCTCACTGGCG-3 0 ; S111T3-5, 5 0 -CGCCAGTGAGGTACGCCCGTC-3 0 ; S111C5-3, 5 0 -GAC GGGCGTTGCTCACTGGCG-3 0 ; S111C3-5, 5 0 -CGCCAGTGAGCAA CGCCCGTC-3 0 ; R115Q5-3, 5 0 -TCACTGGCGCAGCTGGGGCTG-3 0 ; R115Q3-5, 5 0 -CAGCCCCAGCTGCGCCAGTGA-3 0 , where letters in italics indicate the resultant base changes. The previously described plasmid pETDCD [11] was used as a template for the mutagenesis reaction. pETDCD contains the reading frame of the E. coli dcd gene under control of the late T7 promoter in the vector pET11a (Novagen). All mutations were verified by sequencing of the entire dcd open reading frame on an ABI PRISM 310 sequencer according to the supplier's manual. The wildThe crystal was flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data to ° 2.2 A resolution were collected at 100 K at beamline I911-3, Max-lab, Lund University Sweden on a MAR Research CCD detector. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with the following cell ° ° ° dimensions: a = 94.2 A, b = 71.3 A, c = 319.9 A. There were 12 polypeptide chains corresponding to four trimers in the asymmetric unit and ° approximately 41% solvent (Matthews coefficient 2.10 A3/Da). Auto indexing, data integration and scaling were performed using programs from the HKL suite [20]. Diffraction data statistics are summarized in Table 1.

of E138D is very similar to wild-type dCTP deaminase [11]. ° A root mean square deviation of 0.42 A for 1101 Ca-atoms was determined for one wild-type trimer (Protein Data Bank code 1XS1, chains A­C) superimposed with one E138D trimer (chains A­C) using default parameters in O [22]. Rearrangement of the active site in E138D The change of Glu138 to an aspartic acid was expected to lead to an increase in the distance between the side chain carboxylate and O4 of the bound nucleotide (Fig. 1). The distances from Glu138 OE1 and OE2 to dUTP O4 in wild-type dCTP deaminase are 4.8 and ° 4.6 A, respectively (Fig. 1A). However, the corresponding distances from OD2 and OD1 in the E138D structure are ° 5.0 and 4.6 A, not significantly different from the wildtype enzyme complex (Fig. 1B). These distances are maintained at the expense of a small change in the orientation of the pyrimidine ring in dUTP in the E138D complex relative to that of wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1C). Small movements of the side chains of Arg115, Gln182, Val136 which are involved in the binding of dUTP are also observed. In the previously proposed catalytic mechanism [11] we suggested that Glu138 is responsible for activation of a water molecule, which is held in place by hydrogen bonds to Ser111 and Ala124 (Fig. 2). In the E138D:dUTP structure the hydrogen bond lengths between Ser111, Ala124, and the water molecule wat523 are similar to those of the same residues and water molecule wat5 in the wild-type structure (Fig. 1A and B). It seems likely that the side chain substitution in E138D (Fig. 1B) imposes a slight rearrangement of the active site to maintain acceptable distances between the catalytic base (Asp138), the nucleotide and the attacking water molecule, wat523 to sustain a catalytically active enzyme. Even so, it should of course be emphasized that the structure of E138D in complex with dUTP is a complex of an enzyme and its product. The slightly changed distances in the hydrogen bond network in the E138D:dUTP complex can therefore only be considered as a guideline to explain the decrease in catalytic activity of the E138D enzyme when compared to the wild-type enzyme. Kinetic and ligand binding studies of mutant dCTP deaminases The two mutant proteins, R115Q and S111C, displayed no detectable activity whereas S111T and E138D were both active although with reduced kcat values of about 30 and 140 fold below wild-type enzyme, respectively. Wild-type dCTP deaminase had a kcat of 1.24 ± 0.09 sÀ1, a S0.5 of 66 ± 9 lM and a Hill coefficient of 1.5 ± 0.3 [12]. The addition of 100 lM dTTP increased the S0.5 and the Hill coefficient for dCTP to values of 168 ± 8 lM and 3.3 ± 0.4, respectively [12]. The cooperativity of dTTP inhibition also increases with an increase in dCTP concentration.

(Protein Data Bank code 1XS1, [11]) as search model with prior removal of water molecules, magnesium ions and dUTP. Glu138 was changed to an aspartic acid residue using the program O [22] and this model was then used in rigid body refinement followed by cycles of positional refinement using Refmac5 [23]. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to 10 out of the 12 molecules (chains A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and K) in the asymmetric unit. The structure of E138D dCTP deaminase contains 193 amino acid residues in 10 of the 12 chains. In chains J and L residues 172­193 and 176­193, respectively, are absent due to missing electron density. There was electron density for three dUTP molecules and three Mg2+ ions in each of the four trimers. Furthermore electron density for one SO4 molecule appeared in each of the 12 molecules after several cycles of positional refinement using Refmac5 [23]. These molecules were model built using O [22]. Water molecules were automatically added using ARP-wARP [24]. There are 459 water molecules in total. The final model has an R-factor of 20.3% and an Rfree factor of 23.9%. PROCHECK [25] was used to check the quality of the final structure. The Ramachandran plot revealed that 88% of the residues are located in the most favored regions, 11% are in the additionally allowed regions and no residues are in the disallowed regions. A summary of refinement statistics is shown in Table 1. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with the accession code 2v9x.

Results Overall structure of E138D The E138D variant of dCTP deaminase from E. coli folds as a compact homotrimer, where the subunits are related by a 3-fold axis. One Mg2+ ion and one dUTP molecule are bound in between each pair of subunits, which gives three active sites in every trimer. The overall structure

of dTTP induced a slight cooperativity for dCTP saturation although dTTP hardly had any effect on the apparent S0.5 for dCTP as evaluated from fits of Eq. (1) to the individual data sets in Fig. 3A. It was not possible to perform a global fit of the data in Fig. 3A. Even though the cooperativity induced by the presence of dTTP is small it cannot be described by Eq. (2). In Fig. 3B is shown the result from kinetic analysis of the E138D enzyme with respect to dCTP saturation and dTTP inhibition. The data could be fitted to Eq. (2) since there appeared to be no change in the degree of cooperativity for dCTP saturation with increasing dTTP concentrations. In contrast to what is observed for wild-type enzyme the Hill coefficient remained similar for all curves in Fig. 3B when analyzed using Eq. (1). The S0.5 for dCTP had increased about 5 fold whereas the I0.5 for dTTP and the cooperativity, ni, were found to be similar as for wild-type enzyme as listed above. Since the S111T enzyme was active it was tested whether the lack of activity of S111C was caused by an inability to bind nucleotides at the active site as a consequence of the

side chain substitution. As can be 3D both dCTP and dTTP show S111C. The calculated constants S111C (Fig. 3D) are very similar enzyme listed above. Discussion

seen from Fig. 3C and hyperbolic binding to for dTTP binding to to those for wild-type

The previously predicted roles of Ser111, Arg115 and Glu138 in catalysis of the dCTP deaminase reaction [11] can be envisioned as follows (Fig. 2): Glu138 abstracts a proton from wat5 to form the hydroxide ion that attacks the 4-position of the pyrimidine ring of dCTP, Ser111 positions wat5 and subsequently the formed hydroxide ion via a hydrogen bond. Arg 115 keeps the side chain of Ser111 in place, and more importantly, the close proximity of Arg115 that has a lower pKa than Ser111, plays the unusual role to prevent the deprotonation of Ser111 when forming a hydrogen bond to the catalytic hydroxide ion. The lack of detectable activity observed for the R115Q replacement is in agreement with the above mechanism where both the

charge and the ability to maintain a protonated Ser111 in the presence of a hydroxide ion, as well as the hydrogen donor function of the guanidinium group of Arg115 to orient Ser111, are important properties. A possible additional role of Arg115 is to polarize the substrate for attack of the hydroxide ion at C4 of the pyrimidine. If Arg115 was acting only as a hydrogen donor to Ser111 this role could probably have been fulfilled, at least to some extent, by a correctly oriented glutaminyl at position 115. Apparently, the additional bulky methyl group introduced in the S111T enzyme is not easily accommodated in the active site of dCTP deaminase. However, even though the kcat of the S111T enzyme was greatly reduced compared to wild-type enzyme the finding that the S111C mutant protein displayed no detectable activity emphasize the importance of a hydroxyl at this position. An explanation for the lack of activity of the S111C protein may be that the cysteinyl mercapto group will deprotonate more readily due to a lower pKa of this group compared to the hydroxyl of Ser111. As evidenced by the binding of both dCTP and dTTP (Fig. 3B and C) the side chain substitution in S111C only seems to affect catalysis and not substrate/ligand recognition. Also the replacement of Glu138 by an Aspartyl has severe impact on the catalytic activity of dCTP deaminase. Even though only slightly altered hydrogen bond distances (Fig. 1A and B) together with a small repositioning of the pyrimidine ring of dUTP (Fig. 1C) were observed in the structure of the E138D active site compared to wild-type enzyme the greatly reduced kcat for the E138D enzyme indi-

cates that unfavourable distances between side chains, substrate and catalytic water molecules in the active site are likely to arise during transition state formation. In order to interpretate the results from dTTP inhibition of the S111T and E138D enzymes (Fig. 3A and B) it may be necessary to recapitulate the suggested mechanism for dTTP regulation of dCTP deaminase. This mechanism has proved to be somewhat complex despite the immediate appearance of a simple competition between dTTP and the substrate nucleotide for binding to the active site. The binding of dTTP or dCTP occurs to two different conformers in which all three active sites of the trimer are arranged in either an inactive or an active conformation, respectively, [12]. A pre-steady state kinetic analysis revealed a lag in product formation of dCTP deaminase. This lag increased in the presence of dTTP indicating a regulatory mechanism that is not a simple rapid equilibrium between two conformers of dCTP deaminase and also that the enzyme is partly on the inactive form in the absence of substrate [12]. The transition of the enzyme to the active conformer occurred with a rate constant comparable to kcat. Based on these observations it was suggested that the observed cooperativity of dCTP binding was mainly derived from kinetic cooperativity [26]. Supporting this suggestion was the finding that equilibrium binding of dTTP to dCTP deaminase was hyperbolic in contrast to the cooperative inhibition seen in kinetic experiments [12]. As mentioned the reduced kcat of S111T most likely reflects a problem in accommodating the additional methyl group of Thr111 in the dCTP complex during transition

The space fill of the displayed entities are displayed as dotted surfaces. S111T was modelled from the structure of E. coli dCTP deaminase (E138A) in complex with dTTP (Protein Data Bank code 2j4q, chain B; [12]). A threonine rotamer was chosen so that the positioning of the hydroxyl group of the Ser111 side chain was kept. The figures are made using PyMol (DeLano Scientific).

state formation. However, the observation that S111T was almost inert to dTTP inhibition (Fig. 3A) identified an additional effect of the side chain substitution. Since crystals of S111T suitable for structural analysis could not be obtained attempts were made to envision the consequences of the S111T replacement based on the structure of E138A in complex with dTTP (Fig. 4) reported previously [12]. It is not unlikely that the additional methyl group of Thr111 imposes a steric strain (overlapping dotted spheres in Fig. 4A) in the mutant enzyme that prevents the structural transition that leads to the inactive conformer of dCTP deaminase. Also, the E138D enzyme showed changes in dTTP inhibition compared to wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme the E138D enzyme displayed a constant Hill coefficient for dCTP saturation whether determined in the absence or presence of up to 200 lM dTTP (Fig. 3B). This absence of increasing cooperativity in response to the presence of dTTP may reflect altered ratios between rate constants involved in the transition between conformers and the kcat for the E138D enzyme. However, the low kcat for the E138D enzyme prevented analysis of the presteady state kinetics of this enzyme to clarify this issue. Finally, the results from binding studies with the inactive S111C enzyme and the ligands dTTP and dCTP (Fig. 3C and D) that show hyperbolic binding curves also indicate that the cooperativity observed for dCTP saturation and dTTP inhibition in kinetic experiments with dCTP deaminase probably is the result of kinetic cooperativity [26,27].
