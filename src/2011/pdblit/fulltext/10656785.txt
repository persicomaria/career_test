Abstract AlcR is the transcriptional activator of the ethanol utilization pathway in Aspergillus nidulans. The zinc DNA-binding domain contains ligands of zinc, six cysteines ZZn 2 Cys 6 . or five cysteines and one histidine ZZn 2 Cys 5 His.. The utilisation of complementary approaches such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, mutational analysis, zinc content evaluation, determination of specific binding connecting structural and biological data, have allowed to determine zinc environment and to analyse the involvement of amino acids. The determination by EXAFS of zinc ligands Zfour sulphur atoms., the Zn ∞ content in the protein Z2 : 1., the evaluation of the distance between two zinc atoms Z3.16 " 0.02 A., together with the total loss of specific DNA-binding activity when one cysteine ligand is mutated, are in favour of a zinc cluster model in which six cysteine sulphurs ligate two zinc atoms. XANES spectra of wild type and H10A AlcR protein are virtually identical indicating that Histidine 10 does not have a direct contribution in zinc ligation but electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that His10 is involved in DNA-binding. In contrast, proline 25 does not seem to play any direct role in the DNA-binding activity but XANES spectra of Pro25A AlcR protein are slightly modified comparing to the wild type protein spectra. This suggests a role of the proline in the stabilisation of the Zn cluster structure. AlcR DNA-binding domain belongs to the zinc binuclear class family ZZn 2 Cys 6 . with unique characteristics resulting from its primary and secondary structures and its binding specificity toward direct and inverted repeat target. q 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

In fact, the alc regulon is much more complex since it comprises at least five other alc genes submitted to the same types of regulation w3x. This alc system has been worked out at the physiological and the molecular levels and has allowed the setting up of a regulation model in which specific induction interacts and competes with carbon catabolite repression w4,5x.

Specific induction is mediated by the binding of the activator AlcR to specific palindromic and direct repeat DNA sequences with the same consensus core, located upstream of the controlled genes w6≠8x ZFillinger and Felenbok, unpublished results. . This binding involves the contact of the AlcR protein in the major groove of the DNA helix w7x. The AlcR DNAbinding domain has been classified previously in the zinc binuclear class family encountered only in ascomycetes w9x. In fact, two possibilities of zinc ligation could exist since AlcR contains six cysteines and one histidine residues as possible ligands of zinc. We know that AlcR DNA-binding domain contains two zinc atoms per mole of protein w10x. Thus, AlcR could coordinate two zinc atoms using either six cysteines Z Zn 2 Cys 6 . or five cysteines and one histidine ZZn 2 Cys 5 His.. Several important -characteristics differentiate the AlcR DNA-binding domain from the other binuclear cluster proteins family as shown in Fig. 1. Primarily, an unusual extended sequence of 16 residues, instead of 6r8 usually observed, is found between the third and the fourth cysteine of the domain; secondarily, the AlcR DNA-binding motif is able to bind to repeated sites as well as single sites with the same consensus core w11,12x. A variable number of nucleotides between the two half sites of functional direct repeat targets was observed whereas the half sites of the functional palindromes targets were separated by two nucleotides w6≠8x; thirdly, AlcR is able to bind in vitro to its cognate sites as a monomer w11x. Most of the other members of this family recognize either inverted repeats separated by a number of nucleotides characteristic of each DNAbinding protein or direct repeats but not both type of sequences. These features of AlcR involve most probably a special mode of binding of the AlcR protein. Therefore, the predictions of three dimensional and local structures for AlcR protein cannot be

deduced directly from the already resolved structures of GAL4 and PPR1, either by EXAFS, NMR or crystallographic studies w13≠16x. X-ray absorption spectroscopy Z EXAFS and XANES. is widely used to probe the environment of metal in metalloproteins w17x. The analysis of the high-energy region Z EXAFS. of the X-ray spectrum allows to obtain information concerning distances, type and number of atoms coordinated at the metal site. Recently, EXAFS have contributed to determine Zn coordination in Zn cluster and Zn finger proteins w16,18x. The low-energy region ZXANES. of the X-ray spectrum is sensitive to the multiatom positional correlations and in principle can be used to determine bond angles and site symmetries w19x. Features of XANES spectrum can be used to distinguish between different models of local structure w20,21x. The energy domain very close to the absorption edge contains information on the geometric and the electronic structure of metal site in both inorganic complexes and metalloproteins w22x. The absorption spectral studies probe the local density of states: the energy and the intensity of the electronic transitions can be related to the geometry of the metal centre. In this study, we have applied X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the first coordination shell of ligands around one ZnZII. in the AlcR DNA-binding domain, and in mutants of this domain, expressed as a fusion protein. EXAFS analysis demonstrates that Zn binds AlcR fusion protein with Zn 2 S 6 coordination. A model consequently is proposed in which two cysteines are in bridge position and the distance ∞ between metal atoms is short Z 3.16 " 0.02 A. in agreement with a zinc binuclear cluster model. Three mutants in the DNA-binding domain motif were studied by X-ray spectra to observe zinc sites as function of the amino acid mutation. In order to connect structural and biological data, the ability of the mutants to specifically bind AlcR DNA targets and to bind zinc were also tested. Results show clearly that: Zi. one ZnZII. atom is ligated by four cysteine residues which are necessary for DNA-binding activity, Z ii. the ligation of zinc atoms does not involve an histidine which however is involved in DNA-binding, Z iii. the proline residue localised in the extended sequence between the third and the fourth cysteine does not play a role in the type of binding of the zinc domain but seems to have an indirect role on the zinc site

To study the Zn-binding region, we expressed and purified a fragment of protein corresponding to amino acids 7≠60. Directed mutagenesis was achieved following the method of Kunkel w24x. X-ray absorption spectra were carried out on GST≠ AlcRZ7≠60. fusion protein to avoid additional and time consuming purification steps. The GST≠AlcR fusion protein was extensively dialysed against standard buffer, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, b-mercaptoethanol 10 mM, which was treated with the chelating resin Chelex 100 to remove external contaminating zinc. The zinc concentration was determined using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer Z Varian AA775.. Measurements were performed against the dialysis buffer. Z2. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays ZEMSA. were performed with a MiniProteanII apparatus from BioRad. The DNA-binding shift assay was as described w6x. Six percent polyacrylamide Z 30r0,36. gels were run in TBE 1X at 48C and 18 Vrcm for 30 min. Double stranded oligonucleotides Z32 mer. containing a specific target for AlcR was labelled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and w g- 32 PxATP. The sequence of the oligonucleotide Ztop strand. is represented 5X to 3X and corresponds to the target C on the alcA promoter region w6x: 5X-GGTACTGTCCGCACGGGATGTCCGCACGG AGA-3X The apparent dissociation constant of the fusion protein was estimated by EMSA and approximated to the concentration of protein required to complex 50% of the free probe. Quantification was performed on a PhosphoImager ZMolecular Dynamics. . Z3. X-ray absorption experiments were carried out at D21 experimental station at DCI storage ring of LURE ZOrsay, France. with a positron beam energy of 1.85 GeV and a maximum current of 310 mA. X-ray absorption measurements were performed at zinc K-edge using the SiZ311. double crystal monochromator w25x. Spectra were recorded in fluores-

cence mode with an array of 7 germanium solid state detectors with individual electronics w26x. Zinc concentration for XAS measurements was 2≠4 mM. Room temperature measurements on GST≠AlcR Z7≠60. and GST≠AlcR Z 7≠60. H10A were repeated several times on different samples with an acquisition time ranging between 3≠4 h. EXAFS spectra were collected with 2 eV steps in the energy range 9600≠10 600 eV. XANES spectra were recorded with 0.3 eV steps in the energy range 9600≠9750 eV. Data analyses were performed in several steps using rapid curve wave signal and multiple scattering theory w27,28x in EXCURV90 program. The statistical tests of EXCURV90 have shown that the Zn≠S and the Zn≠Zn distances are meaningful. EXAFS analysis was performed on: Za. Single shell signals: An R-space window centred on the main peaks was used in the back transformation to extract the first or second shell contributions from the EXAFS signal. Zb. The k 3-weighted EXAFS signal back Fourier filtered, with several R-space windows between 3 and ∞ 5 A wide, a procedure which implies the two preceding isolated shells in the same calculation. Zc. The full raw EXAFS data expanded over 580 eV: This analysis has permitted to verify that in filtering EXAFS signal noise is eliminated, but not structural information. The above extracted signals were simulated with a theoretical spectrum. Phase shift has been calculated by EXCURV90 program and calculation procedures were checked against a model compound of known crystal structure, ZnS.

3. Results 3.1. X-ray absorption studies of AlcR fusion protein We wanted to probe the immediate environment of the zinc ions in the AlcR fusion protein in order to get some insights on the number and types of ligands and their distances from the Zn atom. Previous studies of molecular interactions between AlcR fusion protein and specific targets in the alcR and alcA promoters were performed with a fusion

In fact, it was valuable to use this type of truncated peptide since in numerous zinc binuclear clusters, as GAL4 w13x, this amino part does not have any role, either in resolution of three dimensional structure or in DNA-binding activity. However, prior to local structure, we wanted to ascertain that there was no difference using the AlcR fusion protein containing or not this N-terminal part since both types of proteins were used in these studies. We first measured the zinc content of both types of fusion protein, which was the same: 2.5 " 0.3 of ZnZII. per mole of protein. These data are in agreement with previous work showing that GST alone does not bind ZnZII. and that GST≠AlcR Z 7≠60. binds 2.5 Z"0.3. mol of ZnZ II. per mole of protein w10x.

The contribution of the first coordina∞ tion shell was isolated using a R-space window 1 A wide. For ZnS model compound, data were fitted ∞ with 4 sulphur atoms at 2.34 " 0.02 A with a ∞ 2. For GST≠AlcRZ7≠ Debye≠Waller factor of 0.006 A ∞ 60. fit results were: 4 sulphurs at 2.34 " 0.02 A with ∞ a Debye≠Waller factor of 0.008 A2.

Experimental absorption spectra Z data not shown. indicate that the structure around the Zn atoms is not affected by the presence of the N-terminus of AlcR. To take into account contributions of multiple atomic shells, GST≠AlcRZ 7≠60. EXAFS signal was ∞ Fourier filtered between 1.4 and 4 A. The truncation artefacts were minimized by matching the window functions of the model and unknown compound. Fitting of these data was performed on a range of about 445 eV. The theoretical EXAFS simulation indicates that data are best fitted with a contribution Zn≠S and Zn≠Zn components.

However, the split of S distances was introduced to further investigate the Zn site structure and to compare distances obtained for AlcR to those for PPR1. Results are in full accordance with those observed for PPR1. Nevertheless it is important to consider that Lee et al. w30x have suggested a formula

to determine the distance resolution on data analysis. Although, this formula takes into account only k max but not other parameters such as quality of data, it indicates that this result is near to the limits of the technique's sensitivity. So, the split of S≠Zn distances have to be considered with some prudence. This analysis also allowed the determination of a ∞ Zn≠Zn distance of 3.16 " 0.02 A. Statistical tests w29x indicated that adding Zn≠S and Zn≠Zn distances to the calculation significantly improves the FI and the probability that the shells are meaningful being 99%. Moreover, we have performed analysis on raw data, simulating EXAFS signal between 3.2 and ∞ 11 Ay1. In this simulation Z Fig. 2Z a,b.. we have

3.2. Cysteine 49 is necessary for zinc-binding In order to assess the role of cysteine residues involved in zinc- binding, site directed mutagenesis was used to replace cysteine 49 by serine. This changes the thiol group of the cysteine into a hydroxyl group unable to coordinate zinc. Fig. 3ZA. shows the DNA-binding ability of the GST≠AlcRZ 7≠ 60.C49S mutant on a specific direct repeat target. No complex can be detected with the mutant even using a high amount of protein. When dialysed in order to eliminate external contaminating zinc, the protein forms a precipitate which cannot be resolubilized for the determination of its zinc content by atomic absorption spectroscopy. X-ray absorption measurements, performed on the precipitate, show a very low signal of fluorescence, 58 counts per seconds per detector. We have estimated the Zn content comparing the Zn K a fluorescence signal of diluted H10A AlcR and of precipitated C49S AlcR in the same experimental conditions Zacquisition geometry, sample-older, beam intensity etc.. . The difference of the intensity, normalized by Zn concentration is of 2 orders of magnitude lower in the AlcR cystein mutant. Nevertheless, we have obtained a XANES spectrum with acceptable noise, averaging data of 7 acquisitions, but not an EXAFS spectrum useful for reliable analysis. Comparison between the AlcR fusion protein and the AlcR fusion protein C49S mutant, indicated that the atomic environment of zinc is different in the two proteins Z Fig. 4. . The relevant differences in relative XANES peak intensities support two hypotheses: a. in GST≠AlcR Z7≠60. Zn is in the same site as GST≠AlcR Z7≠60.C49S but this site is modified; b. Zn traces are in one Z or more. non specific siteZs. . In both cases, X-ray absorption data indicate that cysteine 49 participates in Zn coordination. Therefore, mutation in cysteine 49 results in an important loss of Zn-binding, in the absence of another potential metal ligand in the proximal amino acids sequence. These results clearly show the importance of cysteine 49 residue in chelating zinc and in maintaining the conformation of the AlcR DNA-binding domain. 3.3. Histidine 10 does not ligate zinc An important subclass of zinc-fingers protein family contains two zinc fingers with cysteine as well as

histidine coordinating one zinc atom via their sulphur and nitrogen ligands respectively ZCys 2 His 2 . . It was important to determine if zinc binuclear clusters could also utilize histidine as a zinc ligand. In the AlcR DNA-binding domain there is an histidine residue at position 10, separated by 1 residue from the first cysteine, Cys12. Therefore, this His10 could be involved in zinc chelation. Thus, this residue was replaced by alanine. Fig. 3Z B. presents DNA-binding assays of the GST≠AlcRZ 7≠60. H10A mutant and wild type fusion proteins on direct repeat specific target. Replacing histidine 10 by alanine considerably

decreases the DNA-binding ability of the mutant protein. The apparent dissociation constant is estimated about 10y4 M for the mutant versus 4 = 10y8 M for the wild type. The zinc content was also determined on the GST≠AlcRZ 7≠60. H10A protein and was found to be equivalent to the GST≠AlcRZ 7≠ 60. protein both containing 2.5 " 0.3 zinc atoms per molecule of protein. XANES spectra of AlcR His10 mutant do not show any effect of histidine residue mutation Z Fig. 4.. EXAFS data analysis of first atomic shell contribu∞ tion, isolated by a window function in R-space 1 A wide, indicates that in this histidine mutant Zn atom is coordinated by four cysteines. EXAFS results are summarized in Table 1. Through all over the different kinds of simulation, we can conclude that histidine 10 is not involved in zinc coordination by its nitrogen ligand. Therefore, the decrease of DNA-binding of the mutant is not correlated with a modification of the site coordinating zinc atoms. The involvement of histidine 10 residue in DNA-binding occurs by another mechanism than the coordination of zinc. 3.4. P25A AlcR protein In contrast with similar proteins containing binuclear zinc cluster Zsee Fig. 1., AlcR presents an

extended non consensus sequence of 16 residues, between cysteines 22 and 39, whereas other proteins have 6 to 8 residues. Considering the genomic DNA sequence of alcR, an intron exists between proline 25 and glutamic acid 26. It is known that proline residue induces turns in a-helical amino acid sequences. Since, proline 25 could play an indirect role on the structure, it was replaced by alanine. Fig. 3Z B. shows that GST≠AlcRZ 7≠60. P25A has a similar DNA-binding ability than the wild type. The zinc content is also identical between mutant and wild type proteins Z 2.5 " 0.3.. Therefore this proline residue does not have any role in the DNA-binding of AlcR. XANES spectrum of AlcR proline mutant is quite similar to both the native AlcR fusion protein and histidine mutant spectra, indicating that the site is essentially the same ZFig. 4. . We can however notice that the intensity of the A peak is weaker for the spectrum of the H10A mutant protein. This small difference could be ascribed to a long range structural distortion. A very small change in the conformation can be detected but no modification of the DNA-binding ability was observed. Fig. 5 shows the first shell EXAFS signal of wild-type protein compared to both proline and histidine mutants. The three signals have the same frequency and intensity and EXAFS analysis confirms that the nearby environment is identical. EXAFS results are presented in Table 1. It

indicates two distinct bond lengths, two sulphur cys∞ teine ligands at 2.28 " 0.02 A and two at 2.39 " ∞ Results are in full accordance with those 0.02 A. observed for PPR1. The average value of Zn≠S ∞ distance, around 2.34 A, is very similar to that known w33x. Spectroscopic results and in metallothioneins biological behaviour data Zability to bind in vitro DNA target. clearly show that in the absence of residue cysteine 49, AlcR protein is unable to maintain the site structure and probably to maintain the conformation of AlcR DNA-binding domain. Similar results were obtained in CYP1 by mutating the sixth cysteine w34x whereas when the third cysteine in the GAL4 zinc domain is mutagenised GAL4 still binds DNA sequence, albeit with reduced affinity w13x. It could be possible that changing a central cysteine has less drastic effects than an external one since the symmetrical central cysteine could maintain the sulphur zinc coordination resulting in an organised structure.

4. Discussion In this paper, we provide evidence that in the AlcR DNA-binding domain the first coordination shell of ligands around ZnZII. is sulphur of cysteines in the pattern: Cys-X 2 ≠Cys-X 6 ≠Cys-X 16 ≠Cys-X 2 ≠CysX 6 ≠Cys. Fig. 6 presents a model for the AlcR≠DNA binding domain in which experimental data obtained by X-ray analysis and mutational analysis were taken into account. EXAFS has allowed a measurement of the distance between the two zinc atoms in the cluster Z 3.16 " ∞ 0.02 A.. This short distance is in agreement with the value found for another Zn binuclear cluster protein, PPR1 ZTable 1. . This value is in the range of distances expected for bridging sulphur atoms Z 3.0≠ ∞ 5.0 A. w32x. Previous data have shown that two zinc atoms are present in the AlcR DNA-binding domain w9x. EXAFS spectroscopy, which investigates the coordination shell of ligands around one zinc atom, shows that an average Zn site has four sulphur containing ligands. The analysis performed on raw data

All these data are in agreement with the binuclear zinc cluster model found for GAL4 w14x and PPR1 w15x by X-ray crystallography. However, early EXAFS studies of GAL4 have suggested that Zn could be coordinated by 3 sulphur atoms and oxygen atom belonging to the sulphonic acid group from Hepes buffer, which displaces a sulphur ligand w35x. Furthermore, two dimensional 1 H NMR w13x did not eliminate the possibility that an oxygen could be a Zn ligand, suggesting that hydroxyl of Tyr 40 could displace one of the cysteine ligands during a small conformational change. Therefore, we wanted to check if the ZnS 3 N structure in AlcR DNA-binding domain could have a physical meaning: the light atomic weight atom Znitrogen or oxygen. complexing Zn could belong either to the buffer or to an amino acid of the protein. The first possibility could be easily eliminated as we did not use a buffer with a potential oxygen donor, but the second possibility could not be eliminated formally as in the amino acid sequence of AlcR there is a histidine residue ZHis 10. near a sulphur ligand ZCys 12.. We have to point out that in the absence of other structural information, X-ray absorption spectroscopy has to be used carefully to define the ligand coordination especially if we have to distinguish ZnS 4 and ZnS 3 N. These two models provided fits that may be considered possible solutions in EXAFS analysis of AlcR protein experimental data. The same difficulties in establishing the individual sulphur and nitrogen coordination numbers have been encountered in investigations of a copper protein, stellacyanin w36x and of another Zn protein, the bateriophage T4 gene 32 protein w18x. EXAFS and XANES spectra analysis, performed on the wild type and on the histidine mutant AlcR proteins, gives the same results. This is in agreement with the biological experiments: when the His10 is mutated in the AlcR DNA-binding domain, the Zn content is unchanged and the mutant protein is still able to bind specific targets. All the results obtained on the AlcR histidine mutant demonstrated univocally that histidine 10 is not directly involved in the ZnZ II. binding and therefore that only the ZnS 4 model is valid. The determination by EXAFS of zinc ligands Z four sulphur atoms., the Zn content in the protein Z 2 : 1.,

the evaluation of the distance between two zinc atoms ∞ Z3.16 " 0.02 A. are in favour of a zinc cluster model in which six cysteine sulphurs ligate two zinc atoms. However, histidine 10 is important for AlcR DNA-binding, since the apparent affinity of the mutated protein for its DNA target is 2500 fold decreased when compared to the wild type. Interestingly, in Saccharomyces cere’isiÊ CYP1 transcription factor, the deletion of the histidine residue localised C-terminal to the zinc cluster has no effect on DNA-binding w34x but abolishes completely transcription activation by CYP1 w37x. Therefore, the role of the histidine residue should be different. It was suggested that amide protons could stabilise the zinc cluster by forming hydrogen bond to sulphur atoms w13x. This could also be the role of this histidine residue in AlcR DNA-binding domain. The strongly conserved proline residue, one residue N-terminal to the fourth cysteine in the Zn 2 Cys 6 family, is not present in AlcR. It was shown that in GAL4, this proline is involved in joining the two substructures of the zinc binuclear cluster by a cispeptide bond w14x. Furthermore, this proline is necessary for a correct folding of the protein, since the mutated proline protein requires a higher level of zinc to retain activity w38x. In another Aspergillus nidulans binuclear cluster in the proline utilisation pathway, PrnA, the conserved proline residue is also essential for in vivo PrnA activity w39x. In AlcR, a proline is also located between the third and the fourth cysteine, three residues C-terminal to the third cysteine in the non consensus sequence Zsee Fig. 6. . When this residue is mutated into alanine, the zinc content of the mutated protein does not change and furthermore its affinity is unchanged. However, minor conformation changes are observed in the XANES spectrum, suggesting a role of the proline in the stabilisation of the cluster structure. Taken together, our structural and biological data confirm that by number of different features, AlcR presents another example of a domain which belongs to the Zn 2 Cys 6 family. Despite the important differences between AlcR and the other members of the zinc cluster family, they have no influence on the coordination of the two zinc atoms by six sulphurs as shown by the Zn≠S and by the Zn≠Zn distances. These differences should be important in the mode of recognition of AlcR by specific targets.
