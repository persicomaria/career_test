Abstract A histone-like gene, PHS051 from hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 strain, was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant histone, HPhA, encodes a protein of 70 amino acids with a molecular weight of 7868 Da. Amino acid sequence analysis of HPhA showed high homology with other archaeal histones and eukaryal core histones. The HPhA was purified to homogeneity by heat precipitation and affinity chromatography. Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate that the purified HPhA has high affinity to DNA. The complex of the HPhA and DNA allows DNA to be protected from cleavage by the restriction enzyme TaqI at 65 °C. Circular dichroism spectra reveal that the conformation of the recombinant histone HPhA becomes looser when temperatures increase from 25 to 90 °C. The HPhA has inherited a remarkable thermostability especially in the presence of 1 M KCl and retained DNA binding activity at extreme temperature, which is consistent with our previous report about its structure stability analyzed by X-ray crystallography.

Keywords: Histone; Archaea

All organisms can be divided into one of the three major domains: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya on the basis of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences, with the deepest phylogenetic branch separating the bacterial lineage from archaeal/eukaryal lineage [1]. Members of the archaea display what are generally considered to be both bacterial and eukaryal features, which indicates a possible evolutionary relationship between eukarya and archaea [2]. An impressive example of eukaryal-associated feature is the archaeal histones. Histones, which are highly basic DNA binding proteins, are abundant and conserved in eukaryotic cells. Histone-like proteins are also conserved in archaea. Since the first archaeal histone (HMf) was reported by Reeve and co-workers [3], several archaeal histones were purified and characterized. Studies show that the primary sequences, tertiary structures, and dimer formation of archaeal histones are conserved in the eukaryal nucleosome core histones

H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Besides phylogenetical and structural similarity with the eukaryal histones, archaeal histones share the properties of eukaryal ones: are small, basic, relatively abundant in cytoplasm, toroidally wrap DNA, protect DNA from nuclease digestion, and/or form nucleosome-like structures. However, unlike their eukaryal relatives, archaeal histones form both homodimers and heterodimers. They do not have N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences that extend beyond the histone fold. Protein crosslinking studies have indicated that these structures, designated archaeal histones, contain a histone tetramer rather than an octamer [4­6]. Although archaeal histones have very similar primary sequences and 3D structures, their unfolding temperatures are not identical [7]. No general rules for thermal stabilization have been deduced so far from sequence or structural data. Evidently, the presence of thermostable amino acid, improved packing density, and additional networks of ion pairs play a major role in the discussion of thermal adaptation strategies. To get the interaction mechanism between histone and DNA at high temper-

ature, it is necessary to characterize structure and properties of the histones from different sources. Many hyperthermophilic archaea have been isolated from deep-sea hyperthermal environments and they can grow at temperatures near 100 °C. Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 strain is a hyperthermophilic archaeon with the optimum growth temperature at 98 °C [8]. The genome sequence of this organism has been completed at the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (Tokyo, Japan) [9]. Two open reading frames PHS051 (HPhA) and PHS046 (HPhB) were putative archaeal histones. We studied PHS051 (GenBank Accession No. AP000007). Our previous work has revealed the structure of the recombinant HPhA [10,11]. It has a larger hydrophobic contact area, an increased number of hydrogen bonds, and a reduced solvent-accessible area. We also observed a unique network of tyrosine residues located at the crossover point of the two HPhA monomers, which locks them together and stabilizes the dimer [11]. In this paper, we characterized the recombinant histone through its overexpression, purification, DNA binding ability, thermostability, and structure change at different temperatures by using techniques of electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and circular dichroism spectroscopy.

BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) according to manufacturerÕs protocol. Expression and purification of the recombinant HPhA The recombinant plasmid transformed E. coli BL21Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL was grown at 37 °C in 2YT medium with 50 lg/ml ampicillin for 3 h. When the A600 of the culture was about 0.6, the cultures were induced by the addition of isopropyl-b-D -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM and then incubated at 25 °C for 12 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation (7000g at 4 °C for 15 min) and kept at )40 °C for future use. Frozen cells were thawed at room temperature, resuspended in 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) that contained 100 mM NaCl, and then lysed by sonication. The disrupted cell solution was treated at 85 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation (24,000g at 4 °C for 20 min), the clear supernatant was obtained. DNase I (20 lg/ml) and MgCl2 (5 mM) were added to the supernatant and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, and then solid NaCl was added to a final concentration of 3 M. The precipitate that formed after incubation for 10 min at 95 °C was removed by filtration through a 0.45 lm Millipore membrane. The filtrate was desalted by PD-10 desalting column (16 Â 25 mm Pharmacia) and the recombinant HPhA was recovered from the flowthrough fraction. The fraction of HPhA was loaded onto a HiTrap heparin­ Sepharose column (16 Â 25 mm Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1­1 M NaCl. The HPhA fraction was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.1 M Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at )20 °C. Protein analysis The concentration of the expressed protein was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Approximate protein concentrations were established by Bradford assays and utilizing bovine serum albumin Fraction _ (Sigma) as the standard protein. Tricine­sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine­SDS­PAGE) [13] was carried out as follows: separating gel, 1.5% bisacrylamide, 15.0% acrylamide, and 13.3% (w/v) glycerol; spacer gel, 1.5% bisacrylamide, 8.5% acrylamide; and stacking gel, 1.5% bisacrylamide, and 2.5% acrylamide. After running for 45 min at 3 V/cm followed by 2 h at 12 V/cm, the gel was stained with 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol, and 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 for 1 h with gentle shaking and then destained with 10% acetic acid and 25% methanol. The protein bands were visualized and quantified using Arthur multi-wavelength fluoroimager

Materials and methods Enzymes and reagents for molecular cloning Most of the methods used for molecular cloning were based on those of Sambrook et al. [12]. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using an automatic DNA synthesizer (Takara Biotechnology). T4 DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, and other restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara. Other reagents were obtained from Promega. Cloning and construction of expression plasmid The putative archaeal histone gene was found from the P. horikoshii genome sequence and amplified by the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers with NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The primers were TAAGAATTCCTGCATATGTGGATGATGG GAGAATTA and AAAGGTACCAAAGGATCCT TATCAGCTCTTAATAGCGAGCTT NdeI and BamHI cutting sites are as underlined). The amplified sequence was digested using NdeI and BamHI and cloned in pET11a (Novagen). The nucleotide sequence of the inserted gene was determined using a LI-COR Model LIC-4200L (S)-2 sequencer (Aloke, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan) to verify the anticipated sequence. The subcloned histone gene was expressed in the host Escherichia coli

(Perkin­Elmer Life Sciences, USA) and Phoretix 1D Advanced 4.01 software. Compacting assays Histone compacting activity was determined using electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). The HPhA was mixed with EcoRI-linearized plasmid pET21a (5.4 kb). After 15 min incubation at room temperature, 1/6 volume of loading buffer (40% sucrose/0.25% bromophenol blue) was added. The DNA­protein complexes were loaded on 0.8% agarose gels and the electrophoresis was done in TAE buffer with a voltage of 0.7 V/cm. After staining with ethidium bromide, the complexes were photographed. Effect of temperature on the compacting assay The purified HPhA was mixed with EcoRI-linearized pET21a at a protein to DNA mass ratio of 2.5 and incubated at temperatures ranging from 25 to 95 °C for 20 min. Then EMSA was carried out on 0.8% agarose gels and the electrophoresis was done in TAE buffer with a voltage of 0.7 V/cm. Effect of salt concentration on the compacting assay The purified HPhA was incubated in 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) in the presence of 200 mM KCl or 1 M KCl at 95 °C for up to 60 h and then mixed with linear pET21a for 20 min at room temperature at a protein to DNA mass ratio of 2.5. The DNA­protein complexes were loaded on 0.8% agarose gels and the electrophoresis was done in TAE buffer with a voltage of 0.7 V/cm. Ability of HPhA to protect DNA from digestion The plasmid pET21a and HPhA (at protein to DNA mass ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0) were pre-incubated for 10 min at 65 °C. TaqI was then added to the mixture and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for another 1 h. The DNA­protein complexes were loaded on 0.8% agarose gels and the electrophoresis was done in TAE buffer with a voltage of 0.7 V/cm. Circular dichroism of HPhA at different temperatures The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the HPhA were measured with Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Japan). The HPhA was soluted in 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCl and the final concentration of the HPhA was 1.29 mg/ml. CD measurements (200­280 nm) were performed in a 0.2 mm path length cylindrical cell at 25 and 95 °C, respectively. The experiment was repeated five times and an average value was used for the analysis.

Results and discussion Amino acid sequence comparison In the genome sequence data of P. horikoshii, we found two open reading frames, PHS051 (HPhA) and PHS046 (HPhB), encoding histone-like proteins. The sequence alignment of those histones and DNA binding proteins from various organisms was done as shown in Fig. 1A. The results show that the primary sequences of archaeal histones are highly conserved. The sequences ELPIAP were conserved in all archaeal histones, which is a novel protein structural motif found only in archaeal histones [14]. HAGRKTVKA were exactly conserved in not only archaeal but also eukaryal H4 histones. Another region, AGA(E/A)RVS were partially conserved. These sites of archaeal histones appear to interact with DNA molecule in the archaeal nucleosome-like structures [15]. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) demonstrated that archaeal histones shared a more close relationship with eukaryal core histones than bacterial DNA binding proteins, which is consistent with the fact that the structures of archaeal histones and nucleosomes are most similar to those of eukaryal core histones and nucleosomes [16]. HPhA and HPhB contain approximately 80.0% identical amino acids. When conservative substitutions are considered, they are approximately 91.4% similar. From the alignment we know that HPhA and HPhB were highly similar to each other, so HPhA was chosen for further characterization. Expression and purification of the recombinant HPhA For overexpression of recombinant HPhA, a vector pET11a containing the T7 promoter and E. coli BL21Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL were used. BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells can carry extra copies of the argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes. The tRNAs encoded by these genes recognize the AGA/AGG, AUA, and CUA codons, respectively. The presence of these additional tRNA genes resolves the issue of codon bias for archaea, especially for archaeal arginine. The usage of the arginine codons AGA and AGG is much higher in Pyrococcus furiosus than that in E. coli [17]. Since the HPhA contains large amounts of arginine (7%), the use of E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells provides recombinant histone expression threefold higher than that in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (date not shown). After the HPhA gene was expressed in E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)RIL cells, protein bands were visualized and quantified using Arthur multi-wavelength fluoroimager (lane 2 in Fig. 2). The expression level of recombinant HPhA reached 5.3%. The recombinant E. coli was cultured $0.6 (OD600 ) in 2YT medium with ampicillin. After IPTG induction, the E. coli was continued to culture at 25 °C for 12 h.

Tricine­SDS­PAGE (Fig. 2). The molecular weight of about 7.8 kDa is consistent with the calculated molecular weight from the deduced amino acid sequence. Compacting assays of HPhA to DNA fragment From the well-studied histone, HMf from the hyperthermophile Methanothermus fervidus, we know that histone can compact linear DNA larger than 2 kb into nucleosome-like structures (NLS) [4,16,18]. The complexes of DNA and histone migrate faster during agarose gel electrophoresis than the original protein-free DNA molecules. This particular feature is shared in several archaeal histones therefore; EMSA, is used to assay the DNA compacting ability of proteins. In our experiments, linear DNA molecules were used to avoid variabilities in HPhA­DNA interactions that might have resulted from differences in supercoiling in different plasmid DNA preparations. Fig. 3 shows that the HPhA-dependent migration occurred at a lower protein to DNA mass ratio of 0.5 and binding became saturated at a protein to DNA mass ratio of 2.5. All these results reveal that the recombinant histone HPhA has an archaeal histone activity.

Low induction temperatures tend to increase the percentage of target proteins found in soluble form and decrease the formation of inclusion bodies. The prolonged induction (e.g., overnight) at low temperature (25 °C) may prove optimal for the yield of soluble protein. Cells were collected by centrifugation. The obtained cells were lysed by sonication. After heat treatment, DNase I treatment, and centrifugation, the obtained supernatant was used for further protein purification by affinity chromatography (Table 1). The recombinant HPhA polypeptides do not contain UV-absorbing residues suitable for use in protein quantitation. Protein concentrations were therefore determined by amino acid analysis. The purified protein was examined by

Effect of temperature on the compacting assay To examine the effect of temperature on the compacting assay, the purified protein was mixed with EcoRI-linearized pET21a at temperatures ranging from 25 to 95 °C for 20 min and then applied to agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Histone maintained the ability to compact the linear DNA and increased the mobility of DNA when the temperature was below 65 °C. However, the DNA disappeared when the temperature was 85 °C and beyond. This indicated the denaturation of DNA at high temperatures as single stranded DNA

could not bind to ethidium bromide. It suggests that the HPhA cannot maintain the DNA compacting activity at high temperatures. However, the optimum growth temperature of P. horikoshii OT3 strain is 98 °C, the temperature much higher than that in our essay at which the histones failed to maintain the DNA compacting activity. The most possible reason is the DNA substrate in our experimental condition was in a linear form, not as the supercoil form in vivo. Positively or negatively supercoiled forms were found to be more resistant to heat denaturation than linearized one in vitro [19]. The other possible reason is that HPhA structure changed at high temperature. From the far-UV CD spectra data (Fig. 5), we can see that the values of HPhA at 208 and 223 nm increase when the temperature increases from 25 to 95 °C. This indicates that the helix contents of HPhA at 25 °C are higher than those at 95 °C, which means that the HPhA structure became loose at a high temperature. Effect of salt concentration on the compacting ability Many hyperthermophilic archaea isolated from deepsea hyperthermal environments have very high salt concentration in cytoplasm. For example, M. fervideus

has an internal potassium concentration of $1 M. Since the P. horikoshii OT3 strain was also isolated from deep sea, the cytoplasmic salt concentration could also be very high. We tested the effect of salt concentration on the HPhA compacting activity. Fig. 6A shows that HPhA can retain full compacting activity after a 16-h incubation at 95 °C in buffer containing 1 M KCl, losing part of compacting capacity after 32 h. However, when the salt concentration was reduced to 200 mM KCl the HPhA can only retain full activity within 2 h, and few activity after a 8-h incubation at 95 °C (Fig. 6B). The DNA compacting activity of the HPhA is remarkably heat resistant. This inherent heat resistance of HPhA is, however, salt dependent. This reveals that high salt concentration could stabilize the HPhA. As surfacelocated ionic interactions should be reduced by increasing the Kþ concentration, the increased stability of HPhA in high salt may result from the elimination of unfavorable ionic interactions. Ability of HPhA to protect DNA from digestion TaqI is a DNA restriction enzyme which can recognize 4 bp. Histone binding to DNA may protect DNA from the restriction enzyme digestion. It is suggested that HPhA binding may prevent the enzyme access to the restriction site or HPhA binding can change the topology of the restriction site. In the DNA restriction enzyme protection assay (Fig. 7), HPhA provided partial protection to DNA at a lower ratio (0.5 mass ratio). Near complete protection was observed from TaqI digestion at the 1:1 mass ratio of HPhA to DNA. As shown in the above results, HPhA has a high affinity to DNA and can protect DNA from restriction enzyme digestion. The archaeal histones have identical or similar residues at most positions that are structural homologs of these sites, consistent with a conserved mechanism of DNA binding and wrapping. Crystallography analysis showed HPhA has increased buried surface area, more key hydrogen bonds and surface-located ionic interactions, and reduced solvent, compared to the similar structure with other archaea histones [10]. In contrast to eukaryal histones, the HPhA has very few disordered residues at the two termini. The shorter tails of HPhA might contribute to the decreased conformational entropy and prevent proteins from unfolding at high temperatures. Another distinctive structural feature in the HPhA dimer is the tetrad arrangement involving two tyrosine residues Y35 and Y39 from each subunit. One pair of intra-chain hydrogen bonds are formed by the hydroxide oxygen of Y35­Y39, which lock them together and stabilize the dimer. In addition , hydrophobic interactions between the two monomers are the predominant stabilizing forces in the archaeal histone dimmer. We found that the HPhA has the largest hydrophobic contact area as compared with three archaeal

histones HMfA, HMfB, and HfoB [11]. The extreme heat resistance of HPhA should be explicable in terms of its structure. The features of archaeal histones thermostability and DNA affinity might be explored in the field of biotechnology, such as serving as a gene mediator in transfection of the eukaryotic cells in gene therapy [20­ 22]. Effective gene transfer is an important prerequisite for gene therapy. The development of nonviral delivery systems with high efficiency, low toxicity, and immunogenicity is an urgent task [23]. One approach in this direction is the use of protein­DNA complexes as carriers of exogenous genes into the host cell. The recombinant HPhA is a promising gene mediator for cell transfection and this work is under investigation in our laboratory.
