ABSTRACT: The fungal pathogen Colletotrichum lindemuthianum secretes an endo-chitin de-N-acetylase (ClCDA) to modify exposed hyphal chitin during penetration and infection of plants. Although a significant amount of biochemical data is available on fungal chitin de-N-acetylases, no structural data exist. Here we describe the 1.8 Å crystal structure of a ClCDA product complex and the analysis of the reaction mechanism using Hammett linear free energy relationships, subsite probing, and atomic absorption spectroscopy studies. The structural data in combination with biochemical data reveal that ClCDA consists of a single domain encompassing a mononuclear metalloenzyme which employs a conserved His-HisAsp zinc-binding triad closely associated with the conserved catalytic base (aspartic acid) and acid (histidine) to carry out acid/base catalysis. The data presented here indicate that ClCDA possesses a highly conserved substrate-binding groove, with subtle alterations that influence substrate specificity and subsite affinity. Strikingly, the structure also shows that the hexahistidine purification tag appears to form a tight interaction with the active site groove. The enzyme requires occupancy of at least the 0 and +1 subsites by (GlcNAc)2 for activity and proceeds through a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate.

Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is a plant fungal pathogen found extensively in tropical and subtropical regions. Colletotrichum species are the causative agent of anthracnose that affects economically important crop species (1). Furthermore, Colletotrichum sp. have recently been reported to cause subcutaneous and systemic infections among immunosuppressed patients (2). Colletotrichum sp. are facultative biotrophs. Before the fungal hyphae can successfully penetrate and gain access to host tissue, the fungus has to first evade plant antimicrobial hydrolases such as chitinases and -(1,3)glucanases (3, 4). The chitinases degrade fungal chitin, an insoluble linear polymer of -(1-4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).1 The breakdown products may act as elicitors of active defense responses within the plant (5-7).

suggest that exposed fungal chitin polymers are partially deN-acetylated during infection and initial growth within the host (8). Chitosan, the de-N-acetylated product, is a poor substrate for chitinases, which require the presence of N-acetyl moieties for recognition and catalysis (9). Thus, conversion of chitin to chitosan during plant extracellular colonization may protect pathogenic fungal hyphae from being lysed by secreted plant chitinases. The enzyme responsible for chitin modification is a developmentally regulated, secreted, chitin deacetylase (CDA) (10). C. lindemuthianum chitin deacetylase (ClCDA) is a member of the family 4 carbohydrate esterases (CE-4s) as defined by the CAZY database [http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/cazy/CAZY (11)], which include several members that share the primary structure assigned as the "NodB homology domain" (12). Rhizobial NodB (EC 3.5.1.-) is involved in de-N-acetylating the nonreducing end GlcNAc from short chito-oligosaccharides (13, 14) involved in synthesis of Nod factors, which act as morphogenic signal molecules to symbiotic leguminous plant roots. Another large group in the CE-4 family are the peptidoglycan deacetylases (EC 3.1.1.-) that modify bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan by de-N-acetylation of either the N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) or GlcNAc residues of the disugar repeats. MurNAc deacetylation in Bacillus subtilis is carried out by BsPdaA that facilitates the formation of muramic -lactam, which is required for germination lytic enzyme recognition (15, 16).

Structure and Mechanism of ClCDA GlcNAc sugars of peptidoglycan. Consistent with this, pgda strains are hypersensitive to exogenous lysozyme and exhibit significantly less virulence within mouse models (17, 18). Chitin deacetylases (EC 3.5.1.41) have been characterized from several sources: Mucor rouxii (19, 20), Aspergillus nidulans (21), Absidia coerulea (22), two strains of C. lindemuthianum (23, 24), and Saccharomyces cereVisiae (25, 26). It has also been demonstrated that S. cereVisiae CDAdeficient strains show reduced ascospore wall rigidity and increased susceptibility to lytic enzymes (26). Recombinant ClCDA has previously been expressed in Escherichia coli (27) and recently in Pichia pastoris (28). ClCDA is a representative member of the CE-4 family and shares a number of sequence motifs, covering several conserved histidine and aspartic acid residues (Figure 1B). It appears from several kinetic studies that divalent cations may play a role in catalysis (12, 19, 28, 29). Previous studies have shown that ClCDA is an endo-chitin deacetylase with four significant subsites, -2,-1, 0, and +1 (where 0 is the catalytic site), and that subsites -2 and 0 strongly recognize the N-acetyl groups on the GlcNAc sugars whereas subsite +1 recognizes a glucosamine moiety (30-32). These studies have suggested that chitin is only partially deacetylated in a specific manner that may prevent recognition by either chitinases or chitosanases. The first structure of a CE-4 family member, B. subtilis PdaA, was reported recently (33). The protein adopts a ( /R)8 fold with a putative substratebinding groove harboring the majority of the conserved residues. The data obtained from soaking studies proved inconclusive as to possible metal/substrate-binding sites. A more recent structural study of the CE-4 member SpPgdA (34) reveals that its catalytic domain shows the same conserved groove but also revealed a zinc ion coordinated by a conserved zinc-binding triad consisting of His-His-Asp. These residues are highly conserved throughout the CE-4 family. Mutagenesis studies in combination with kinetic data on metal-dependent activity showed that SpPgdA uses a metal-dependent mechanism involving acid/base catalysis similar to other zinc-dependent de-N-acetylases (34). Furthermore, the structures of two bacterial acetylxylan esterases from Streptomyces liVidans (SlCE4) and Clostridium thermocellum (CtCE4) have recently been described in conjunction with compelling biochemical data that implicates these esterases as metal dependent with a preference for Co2+ (35). Here, we present the structure of a recombinant chitin deN-acetylase from C. lindemuthianum (ClCDA), the first "fungal member of the CE-4 family" to be structurally determined, which retains the classical His-His-Asp Zn2+ coordination observed previously. We use X-ray crystallography, enzymology, subsite probing, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, atomic spectroscopy, and ligand modeling to define the structure and investigate the reaction mechanism and substrate binding of ClCDA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization, Structure Solution, and Refinement. Recombinant C-terminal hexa-His-tagged ClCDA protein was cloned from C. lindemuthianum UPS9 strain (GenBank accession number AY633657), expressed, and purified from P. pastoris as described previously (28). The purified protein was stored at -80 °C in Tris-HCl (30 mM, pH 8.0) before being defrosted on ice. The purity was assessed by SDS-

PAGE. The pure ClCDA protein was crystallized using sitting drop vapor diffusion by mixing 1 µL of protein solution (20 mg/mL in buffer) with the same volume of mother liquor solution [30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, and 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.6]. The protein forms platelike crystals that grow at 20 °C within 10 days. Crystals were soaked in mother liquor supplemented with 10 mM ZnCl2 for 3 h, then cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 15% glycerol, and flash frozen in a nitrogen gas stream cooled to 100 K. Data were collected at beam line ID14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. Data were integrated and scaled using the program HKL2000 (36). The ClCDA structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP (37) with the previously solved SpPgdA C-terminal catalytic core (residues 268-463) [Protein Data Bank code 2C1G (34)] as a search model. A single solution was found with an R-factor of 0.559 and a correlation coefficient of 0.278. The resulting model phases were then used for automated model building with WarpNtrace (38), which was able to build 211 out of 255 residues. The resulting model was refined using CNS (39) and REFMAC (40); model building was carried out with O (41) and Coot (42). After several rounds of refinement the electron density maps indicated that two residues (125 and 126) were different from the published sequence for ClCDA (UPS9 strain). It appeared that these residues followed the sequence of the ClCDA ATCC strain, and they were refined as Gln125 and Leu126. These residues are indicated in Figure 1B with stars and are both solvent exposed. Ligands were only included when unambiguously defined by unbiased |Fo| - |Fc|, calc maps. Ligand topologies and coordinates were generated by PRODRG (43), and the figures were made using PyMOL (44). Final data and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Ligand Docking. Computational docking of a GlcNAc trimer with the central sugar forming the predicted oxyanion intermediate was performed with AutoDock 3.0 (45). The

Coordinates and topology of the ligand were produced with PRODRG (43); the pyranose rings were generated in a 4C1 chair conformation. Enzymology. The C-terminal hexa-His-tagged ClCDA protein expressed in P. pastoris was assayed using the fluorogenic labeling method previously described (34). Standard reactions consisted of 100 nM protein (dialyzed into doubly distilled H2O), 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7, and 0.6 mM (GlcNAc)3 in a total volume of 50 µL, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The production of free amine was followed by labeling with fluorescamine and quantified with a glucosamine standard. All measurements were carried out in triplicate. The fluorescence intensity data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with GraFit (47) using the default equations for first-order reaction rates and MichaelisMenten steady-state kinetics. Recombinant C-terminally hexa-His-tagged ClCDA protein was also expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (31). Initial rates of hydrolysis by ClCDA were determined at 30 °C with a continuous spectrophotometric assay by following the rate of decrease in absorbance at 216 nm as described previously (31). N-Halo-(GlcNAc)4 in 20 mM Na2B4O7/HCl, pH 8.5, was preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and reaction was initiated by the addition of ClCDA such that the final concentrations in the assays were as follows: 0.01-0.4 mM N-fluoro-(GlcNAc)4 in the presence of 0.658 µg mL-1 ClCDA, 0.01-0.4 mM N-chloro(GlcNAc)4 in the presence of 0.863 µg mL-1 ClCDA, and 0.01-0.4 mM N-bromo-(GlcNAc)4 in the presence of 1.08 µg mL-1 ClCDA. The plots of initial rates versus substrate concentrations were hyperbolic, and the values of Km and Vmax were determined by fitting the initial velocity curves to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using the program GraFit. The kcat values were calculated using a  216 of 351, 347, and 396 M-1 cm-1 for N-fluoro-, N-chloro-, and N-bromo-(GlcNAc)4, respectively. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESIMS was performed, and the spectra were recorded as described previously (31). InductiVely Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). A sample of ClCDA was extensively dialyzed against deionized water and then shown to be catalytically active. The protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit with BSA standards (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The ClCDA sample and a control sample (deionized water from the dialysis solution) were then analyzed by ICP-MS for the presence of divalent metal ions. ICP-MS was performed at the Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research (PCIGR) at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The accurate zinc concentrations in the ClCDA sample and the control were determined using the method of standard-zinc additions. Calibration curves were constructed by linear regression. Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS). The same ClCDA sample and the control which were analyzed by ICP-MS (above) were also analyzed by GFAAS for the presence of atomic zinc (max ) 213.9 nm). GF-AAS was also performed at the PCIGR at UBC. The

GlcNAcGlcNAcGlcNGlcNAc was synthesized via ClCDA-catalyzed regioselective monodeacetylation of chitotetraose. Chitotetraose (200 mg, 240 µmol) was dissolved in H2O (2.4 L) so that the final concentration was 0.1 mM ()Km value). The solution pH was adjusted to 8.5 by addition of NaOH, and ClCDA was added to a final concentration of 2.0 µg mL-1. The solution was stirred at room temperature until full monodeacetylation was achieved as checked by ESI-MS. The reaction was then stopped by boiling for 5 min. The solvent was evaporated, and the residue (170 mg, 90%) was dried under vacuum and used directly in the next step. Rf ) 0.13 (5:5:2.5:0.2 2-propanol/ EtOH/H2O/NH4OH).

The chitin deacetylase was crystallized, synchrotron diffraction data were collected to 1.8 Å, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the recently published SpPgdA C-terminal domain (residues 268-463) structure as a search model (34), followed by refinement to a final R-factor of 0.172 (Rfree ) 0.215, Table 1). The ClCDA structure reveals a compact single catalytic domain similar to the deformed ( /R)8 fold adopted by other CE-4 family members (Figure 1A). Superposition on the SpPgdA structure (34) yields an RMSD of 1.35 Å on 179 equivalenced CR atoms (Figure 1A). Nevertheless, there are significant topological differences between ClCDA, the C-terminal domain of SpPgdA, and BsPdaA (Figure 1A). The ClCDA N/C-termini are on the same side of the barrel, while in SpPgdA and BsPdaA the N/C-termini are located at opposite ends. The first strand of ClCDA ( 1) and equivalent BsPdaA ( 2) is topologically equivalent to the final strand of the barrel in SpPgdA ( 17, Figure 1A). Indeed, so far all of the structurally defined members of the CE-4 family adopt a degree of "secondary structure swapping" from the canonical CE-4 ( /R)8 fold.

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 31, 2006 9419 The solvent-exposed active site cleft of the protein is formed from the C-terminal ends of -strands 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of the ( /R)8 barrel and includes the five distinct sequence motifs conserved in CE-4 family members (MT1-MT5 in Figures 1B and 2) (34). The most notable difference in the architecture of the catalytic groove compared to other family members is the presence of an extended loop between strand 3 and helix R2 supporting a solvent-exposed Trp79 that protrudes into the catalytic cleft (Figures 1B and 2A). The ClCDA structure also reveals two intramolecular disulfide bonds that may add stability to this secreted protein but are absent from the homologous bacterial SpPgdA and BsPdaA that deacetylate peptidoglycan within the bacterial cell wall. Sequence alignment suggests that one disulfide (Cys38Cys237), tethering the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the structure, is also conserved in the fungal chitin deacetylase from M. rouxii (Figure 1). Further, the tethering of the N- and C-terminal ends in this fashion appears to be common from extensive sequence alignments (not shown) in other CE-4 family members. Although many of the cysteines do not align directly with the ClCDA sequence, the recently solved structure of SlCE-4 reveals a disulfide linkage tethering the N- and C-terminal ends in this fashion (Figure 1B) (35). The other disulfide (Cys148-Cys152) (Figure 1) appears to compensate for the difference in length between the R4 helix of ClCDA and the three residue shorter SpPgdA equivalent, by pinning back the loop containing MT3 to the elongated R4 helix. This places the loop and hence MT3 into a conformation similar to that of SpPgdA, forming one of the sides of the active site groove (Figure 2A). MT4 forms the other side of the active site groove. Compared to SpPgdA, it contains two significant substitutions overhanging the catalytic cleft, a lysine (Lys171) and a tyrosine (Tyr173) replacing a leucine and a solvent-exposed tryptophan, respectively (Figure 2A). The ActiVe Site Shows a ConserVed Metal-Binding Triad. The catalytic groove is similar to that of SpPgdA and SlCE4 (35) with the catalytic subsite being generated by a zincbinding triad consisting of two histidines (His104, His108) from motif 2 and an aspartic acid (Asp50) from motif 1. This His-His-Asp metal-binding triad is conserved throughout the CE-4 family, with the exception of BsPdaA and the recently characterized xylan esterase CtCE4 (35), which only have two metal coordinating residues. The ClCDA electron density map reveals a large peak (30 in difference map), presumed to be zinc, coordinated by the metal-binding triad. The structure also contains a well-ordered acetate ion (7.5 peak in the difference map) in a position similar to that observed in the SpPgdA-acetate complex (Figure 2B). Thus, the zinc ion is coordinated in an octahedral fashion by two histidines, an aspartic acid, a water molecule, and a bidentate interaction with the acetate molecule. One of the acetate oxygens interacts with Asp49 (MT1), which in turn is tethered by a buried Arg142 (MT3). The same oxygen is also within 3.35 Å of His206 (MT5) that interacts with Asp172 (MT4) (Figure 2A). The backbone nitrogen from Tyr145 (MT3) forms a hydrogen bond with the other acetate oxygen. These residues are conserved not only at the sequence level (Figure 1B) but also at the structural level with equivalent SpPgdA residues (Figure 2B). Motif 5 also contains a conserved leucine (Leu204) that in combination with a nonconserved leucine (Leu146) from MT3 forms a

Intermolecular Interactions of the Histidine Tag with the ActiVe Site. During refinement, it became apparent that there was a significant amount of uninterpreted electron density in the catalytic groove of the protein. This density was resolved to be the C-terminal hexahistidine purification tag.

Blair et al. rection, this method rendered a zinc content of 0.7 zinc atom per ClCDA molecule. Hence, the presence of a tightly enzyme-bound zinc ion is confirmed by two independent analytical methods in agreement with the structural observations. This zinc ion must be so tightly bound to the enzyme active site that it does not equilibrate with solution, hence the lack of ClCDA inhibition by EDTA. ClCDA Catalysis Proceeds through a Tetrahedral Oxyanion Intermediate. Previous structural and mutagenesis studies have suggested that CE-4 esterases use a general acid/ base catalytic mechanism involving an activated water molecule, much like that observed for other zinc-dependent hydrolases and probably involving a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate (34). To study the precise nature of the reaction intermediate, we have investigated the hydrolysis of N-halo(GlcNAc)4 derivatives. ClCDA-catalyzed hydrolysis of the N-haloacetamido groups of N-halo-(GlcNAc)4 derivatives (fluoro, chloro, bromo) in the assay buffer at 30 °C and pH 8.5 was studied under steady-state conditions by continuous monitoring of the decrease in A216 over time. Initial rates for all of these substrate analogues followed MichaelisMenten kinetics, and the average values of the observed kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and (kcat/Km) were determined (Table 2). The Km values for all three compounds were similar to that of (GlcNAc)4, suggesting that the haloacetyl group can fit in the active site without any significant steric hindrance (assuming Km approximates Ks). However, the kcat values increased with the increasing electron-withdrawing ability of the halogen substituent. ESI-MS analysis within the steady-state time scale confirmed that the only product was (GlcNAcGlcNAcGlcNGlcNAc), indicating that the kinetic parameters solely represent hydrolysis at the N position (Figure 3E), as previously found with the (GlcNAc)4 substrate (31). The rates of nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of amides/esters are known to increase with electron withdrawal in the acyl portion (48). This is due to the increase of negative charge along the reaction coordinate from the neutral substrate to the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate. Hence, electron withdrawal in the acyl portion stabilizes the intermediate relative to the ground state, thereby decreasing the activation energy. Therefore, a plot of log(rate constant) versus substituent constant () should be linear with a positive slope (F) based on the Hammett linear free energy correlation (Figure 3C,D) (49, 50). The magnitude of the slope (F) is an indication of the extent of charge development in the transition state. A linear relationship was observed (Figure 3F) by plotting log(kcat) versus the Taft substituent constants (1) for H, Br, Cl, and F (51, 52). The values of 1 are defined in terms of the pKa values of the corresponding substituted acetic acids. The presence of a correlation with a positive slope shows that there is a substituent inductive effect in ClCDA-catalyzed hydrolyses of the substituted acetamido groups, indicating the presence of an oxyanion intermediate. The oxyanion intermediate must have a tetrahedral structure in a displacement mechanism. The value of the slope (F ) 1.7 ( 0.3) indicates significant negative charge development at the transition state. This supports the previously proposed CE-4 esterase reaction mechanism (34).

a Direct continuous spectrophotomeric assay. b Fluorogenic labeling method.

Strikingly, this appeared to be an intermolecular interaction, with the C-terminus of one molecule extending into the active site of one of the symmetry-related molecules. The hexahistidine tag appears to make several interactions; the carboxyl oxygen from the C-terminal His254 is in hydrogenbonding distance of His206 N 2 at 2.5 Å and the water molecule closest to the Zn2+ at 2.6 Å. Tyr145 stacks with His251, Asp110 hydrogen bonds with His251 N 2 at 2.9 Å, and several water-mediated hydrogen bonds can also be seen. To confirm that the His-tagged recombinant ClCDA protein expressed in P. pastoris used for crystallization is active, a fluorescence-based assay was used to verify the activity with (GlcNAc)3 revealing that ClCDA initial velocity measurements with increasing substrate concentration fitted Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km was determined to be 0.66 ( 0.05 mM with a kcat of 1.53 ( 0.04 s-1 (Table 2). These values are in keeping with the results previously reported for ClCDA expressed in E. coli and assayed using a direct, continuous spectrophotometric assay (31) that gave a Km of 4.3 ( 0.1 mM and a kcat of 6 ( 1 s-1 for (GlcNAc)3 (Table 2). ClCDA Tightly Binds Zinc. Previous experiments on SpPgdA (34) and xylan esterases (35) have shown that activity of these CE-4 esterases is dependent on the presence of a divalent cation, preferably cobalt or zinc. Strikingly, however, the recombinant ClCDA proteins from both P. pastoris and E. coli were not inhibited by the metal chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), nor was there any significant increase in catalytic activity in the presence of either of the divalent cations Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, or Ca2+ (data not shown). We therefore attempted to directly detect the presence of a tightly bound divalent cation in the recombinant protein. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) analysis showed a higher level of elemental zinc in the ClCDA sample (dialyzed in deionized water) relative to the control (deionized water). The accurate zinc concentrations in the ClCDA sample and the control were then determined by ICP-MS analysis using the method of standard-zinc additions. After correction for the background zinc concentration in the control, the zinc content of ClCDA was calculated to be 0.8 zinc atom per ClCDA molecule. We also determined the accurate zinc concentrations in the same ClCDA sample and the control by another independent method, namely, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS), using the method of standard-zinc additions.

AutoDock (45) to place the proposed oxyanion intermediate of (GlcNAc)3 in the catalytic groove. A representative docked complex is shown in Figure 2C. The centrally positioned GlcNAc carrying the oxyanion intermediate is proximal to the zinc, occupying the 0 subsite. Its O3 hydroxyl is seen to interact with the zinc ion and one of the metal ligands (Asp50). The pyranose ring makes hydrophobic interactions with the adjacent aromatic ring of Tyr173 (MT4). The terminal GlcNAc residues occupy the -1 and +1 subsites

within the exposed groove. The acetyl group of the GlcNAc occupying the -1 position makes no interactions with the protein, which is in keeping with the findings of Hekmat et al. (31). Interestingly, there is a solvent-exposed tryptophan (Trp79) positioned on a nonconserved extended loop that may interact with the proposed -2 subsite binding sugar (Figures 1B and 2). The GlcNAc occupying the +1 subsite is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Lys171 and the hydroxyl of Tyr173. The GlcNAc acetyl group is positioned

9424 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 31, 2006 in a similar conformation to that of the -1 subsite sugar, pointing out of the catalytic groove. The tetrahedral intermediate is coordinated to the zinc, with the two oxygens and the methyl group similarly positioned to the equivalent atoms in the experimentally determined acetate complex (maximum shift of equivalent atoms is 1.2 Å, Figure 2C). One of the oxygens interacts directly with the zinc ion and the backbone nitrogen of Tyr145, while the other oxygen interacts with the proposed catalytic base Asp49. This arrangement is proposed to be the "oxyanion hole" that stabilizes the developing negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen atom during formation of the tetrahedral intermediate. The nitrogen of the tetrahedral intermediate is within 3.7 Å of the His206 N 2 atom that is presumed to be protonated by the concealed and conserved Asp172 and could therefore act as an acid, protonating the nitrogen in the reaction intermediate, which generates a good leaving group. This hypothesis is generated by the degree of conservation of key catalytic residues between ClCDA and SpPgdA (Figure 2A,B) for which mutagenic analysis has been carried out on equivalent residues in SpPgdA and found to be essential for activity (34). From the structural studies, the in silico data, and the reaction mechanism proposed for SpPgdA, it can be proposed that ClCDA de-N-acetylates chitin/chito-oligosaccharides by tightly binding a water molecule to the catalytic zinc. The catalytic base Asp49 abstracts a proton from the water molecule, generating a nucleophile to attack the substrate carbonyl carbon. This produces a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate, the charge of which is stabilized by the metal and the backbone nitrogen of Tyr145. The pKatuned His206 then protonates the reaction intermediate on the nitrogen as it breaks down, generating a free amine and also the acetate product, as seen in the crystal structure (Figure 2A). Hydrophobic Interactions Are Important for Binding of the +1 Sugar. Previously, Hekmat et al. proposed that ClCDA has four specific sugar-binding subsites (-2, -1, 0, and +1), where subsite 0 represents the site of catalysis. They also found that subsite +1 makes the largest contribution to the overall binding free energy change, although it does not seem to interact with or recognize the N-acetyl group of the substrate (31). Interestingly, the structure of the docked complex reveals the presence of a solventexposed tyrosine (Tyr173, structurally equivalent to Trp392 in the SpPgdA structure, Figure 2A,B) that appears to stack with the +1 sugar. To probe the contribution of such hydrophobic stacking interactions at this subsite, 4-nitrophenyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- -D-glucose (pNP GlcNAc) was tested as a substrate for ClCDA (Figure 3B). Although no ClCDA-catalyzed hydrolysis of GlcNAc was observed at concentrations up to 100 mM, 15 mM pNP GlcNAc was deacetylated slowly at 30 °C and pH 8.5 in the presence of 1.17 µM ClCDA over a time period of days as detected by ESI-MS (Figure 3A). The reaction was therefore more than 2 orders of magnitude slower than that measured with (GlcNAc)2 occupying the same subsites 0 and +1. Kinetic parameters for the reaction were not determined because of the limited solubility of pNP GlcNAc and the impossibility of following the reaction spectrophotometrically in the UV region due to very high absorbance by the aromatic pNP group. Nevertheless, the detectable turnover of pNP GlcNAc

Blair et al. by ClCDA supports the importance of hydrophobic interactions at subsite +1. DISCUSSION The mechanistic studies presented here combined with the structural data show that ClCDA is a zinc-dependent mononuclear metalloenzyme. The crystal structure reveals the previously characterized zinc-binding motif (His-His-Asp) first elucidated in the structure of the Gram-positive bacterial peptidoglycan deacetylase SpPgdA (34) and conserved in CE-4 family members with few exceptions. Two "charge relay" side chain pairs are observed, consisting of the catalytic base (Asp49) tethered by a conserved Arg142 and the catalytic acid (His206) tethered by a conserved Asp172, which perform acid/base catalysis using a water molecule as the nucleophile tightly associated to the zinc cofactor. Hammett linear free energy correlations using R-haloacetamido substrate analogues demonstrated the presence of an oxyanion tetrahedral intermediate and significant negative charge development at the transition state. This charge would be stabilized by the oxyanion hole generated by the backbone nitrogen of Tyr145 and the zinc as revealed in the ClCDA crystal structure. It was previously proposed by Hekmat et al. that there are four significant sugar-binding subsites in the active cleft ( -2, -1, 0, and +1) that interact with the GlcNAc moieties from the nonreducing to the reducing end of the substrate. The subsites that make the largest contribution to substrate-binding free energy change are -2 and +1 (31). Probing of subsite +1 using pNP GlcNAc revealed that the enzyme was still able to slowly de-N-acetylate the GlcNAc component, suggesting that the stacking interactions of the phenyl ring with a conserved aromatic amino acid side chain are sufficient to at least partially mimic the reducing end GlcNAc sugar interaction with subsite +1. The presence of the acetamido (N-acetyl) group at subsite +1 may not be required, but in the docking studies undertaken this subsite has the only weakly positively charged patch in a predominantly negatively charged catalytic groove, generated primarily by Lys171, which might prevent a de-Nacetylated sugar from binding in this subsite. This factor may contribute to the hypothesis that only every second GlcNAc sugar in the substrate is de-N-acetylated. This might allow for resistance not only to chitinases, which require the presence of the N-acetyl group to facilitate recognition of chitin, but also to chitosanases, which recognize and hydrolyze chitosan, the de-N-acetylated form of chitin. It may also present a chitosan-rich matrix with a partial positive charge that might aid interactions with the cell membrane. Hence ClCDA may be an important virulence factor for C. lindemuthianum, camouflaging it from host glycosidases as it penetrates and colonizes host tissue. Future studies will be directed toward identification and development of inhibitors of CE-4 esterases to allow the study of their in vivo functions in fungal pathogens. REFERENCES
