Crystallographic Structure of a PLP-Dependent Ornithine Decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a to 3.0 Å Resolution
Cory Momany, Stephen Ernst, Ratna Ghosh, Ning-Leh Chang and Marvin L. Hackert*
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Austin, Austin TX 78712, USA Ornithine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a (L30a OrnDC) is representative of the large, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent decarboxylases that act on lysine, arginine or ornithine. The crystal structure of the L30a OrnDC has been solved to 3.0 Å resolution using MIR phases in combination with density modification (space group P6; a = 195.6 Å, c = 97.6 Å; dimer of 1460 amino acid residues/asymmetric unit; VM = 3.26 Å3/Da). The refined crystallographic R-value was 0.219 (Rfree = 0.268) using 2-fold restraints with a 4s cutoff and 8.0 to 3.0 Å resolution data. Six dimers related by C6 symmetry compose the enzymatically active dodecamer (0106 Da). Each monomer of L30a OrnDC can be described in terms of five sequential folding domains. The amino-terminal domain, residues 1 to 107, consists of a five-stranded b-sheet termed the ``wing'' domain. Two wing domains of each dimer project inward towards the center of the dodecamer and contribute to dodecamer stabilization. The ``linker'' domain, residues 108 to 160, consists of short a-helices separated by a loop that fills in the PLP pocket. The third domain, residues 161 to 413, is an a/b domain containing a seven stranded b-sheet that resembles the PLP-binding domain of the aspartate aminotransferases. The fourth domain, residues 414 to 569, resembles the ``small'' domain of the aspartate aminotransferases, but is significantly larger due to insertions. The remaining carboxy-terminal domain, residues 570 to 730, is organized into multiple antiparallel loops and seven a-helices that help form a deep channel leading to the PLP-binding site.

Introduction
Decarboxylases are involved in a number of physiologically important reactions such as the synthesis of neurotransmitters and polyamines. Though some decarboxylases rely on a pyruvoyl moiety for catalysis (van Poelje & Snell, 1990;

Gallagher et al., 1989), a greater number utilize pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP). Besides decarboxylation reactions, PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze transamination and various elimination reactions. This versatility arises in part from the ability of the cofactor to labilize different bonds around the Ca of amino acid-like substrates (Dunathan & Voet, 1974). While the structures of some PLP-dependent enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (Ford et al., 1980; Kamitori et al., 1988), tryptophan synthase (Hyde et al., 1988), and tyrosine phenol-lyase (Antson et al., 1993) have been studied in detail, structural information relating to the mechanism of action of decarboxylases is sparse. Gani (1991) has suggested there are two classes of decarboxylases and that the histidine in the canonical sequence Ser-X-His-Lys(Pxl) serves as a potential proton donor at the Ca position of the

644 quinonoid intermediate. More recently, Sandmeier et al. (1994) examined all known sequences of decarboxylases by N-1 profile analysis and reported four, independent groups of decarboxylases. The recent structure report of dialkylglycine decarboxylase (DGD; Toney et al., 1993, 1995) may not shed much light on this matter because DGD is anomalous for decarboxylases in that it catalyzes two half reactions. Furthermore, the residues that populate the active site of DGD are more reminiscent of aminotransferases than of the decarboxylases. Ornithine decarboxylases (OrnDCs) provide putrescine as the initial and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of polyamines. Polyamines are necessary components of nearly all cells, from bacterial cells to those of plants and humans. Regulation of OrnDC activity occurs in the cell at the levels of transcription, translation and protein activity. An antizyme has been identified in mammalian cells (Murakami et al., 1992; Li & Coffino, 1993) that binds to OrnDC and targets it for degradation by proteasomes. An antizyme has also been observed in Escherichia coli where it inhibits enzyme activity without targeting it for proteolytic degradation (Canellakis et al., 1993). Many bacteria contain both biosynthetic and biodegradative (inducible) forms of amino acid decarboxylases. Gale (1946) proposed that Lactobacilli induce OrnDC under low pH conditions in rich media to compensate for the pH drop associated with lactic acid production. Thus OrnDC may also participate in pH regulation. The biosynthetic E. coli OrnDC is activated by nucleotides ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP at mM concentrations (Anagnostopoulos et al., 1992) and rat brain OrnDC has also been reported to be activated by GTP at mM levels (Kilpelainen & Hietala, 1994). Although it was reported that OrnDC from L30a was not activated by nucleotides at its pH optimum (Guirard & Snell, 1980), it is highly activated by mM concentrations of GTP, dGTP or GDP nucleotides at higher pH values (>pH 8), but not by ATP, CTP, or UTP (Momany et al., 1992; M.L.H. & D. W. Carrol, unpublished data). OrnDC from L30a is stable, can be purified to high homogeneity in large quantities under proper inducing conditions (Guirard & Snell, 1980), and has been crystallized (Momany & Hackert, 1989). ° ° The space group is P6, a = 195.6 A, c = 97.6 A with a dimer of 1460 amino acid residues/asymmetric ° unit (VM = 3.26 A3/Da). At its pH optimum (pH 5.8), OrnDC exists as a dodecamer (0106 Da) of 83 kDa monomers with 730 amino acid residues per monomer (Hackert et al., 1994). The large size of the L30a OrnDC is in striking contrast to most other PLP-dependent decarboxylases and amino transferases that have molecular masses about half that of this OrnDC. To understand how decarboxylases function and to increase our understanding of PLP-dependent enzymes and their corresponding reactions, we screened crystallization conditions for several PLP-dependent decarboxylases and report here the structure of ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDC) from Lactobacillus sp. 30a (L30a).

Results for 648 nonglycine, non-proline residues from one of the two NCS restrained subunits: most favored regions (83.4%), additionally allowed (15.4%), generously allowed (1.3%), and none in the disallowed regions. All residues in the generously allowed regions are residues in surface loop regions or at the N and C termini. Triangles represent proline residues, squares glycine residues.

Results
° Refinement to 2.9 A resolution using a 4s cutoff resulted in an R-value of 0.18 with good overall stereochemistry but with 14 of 1286 nonglycine, non-proline residues in disallowed regions (PROCHECK; Laskowski et al., 1993). Examination of the resulting model indicated that the rms deviation from 2-fold relatedness among main-chain atoms ° was greater than 1.1 A for only 34 of the 730 amino acid residues. These differences and all the residues with disallowed conformational angles were located at the two termini or in four surface loops (268 to 278; 475 to 478; 505 to 507; 580 to 585) where the electron density was poorest. Following the suggestions of the referees, a portion of the data (8.8%) was removed for monitoring via Rfree and the structural model refined with simulated annealing, but this time with the 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints imposed. The model for the carbon-alpha backbone changed little from the previous model. Following minor manual rebuilding involving the surface loops described above, final rounds of refinement employing only energy minimization with the 2-fold restraint for all residues, and the placement of 107 water molecules resulted in a model structure with a slightly higher crystallographic ° R-value of 0.219 (Rfree = 0.268) for data from 8 to 3.0 A resolution but now with better stereochemistry. An analysis of the model with PROCHECK indicates that there are no non-glycine, non-proline residues lying outside the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Figure 1).

Figure 2. Assignment of secondary structure in L30a OrnDC. The amino acid sequence of OrnDC is shown in one-letter codes with bold type used for those amino acid residues that are identically conserved in several bacterial decarboyxlases as reported by Hackert et al. (1994). The boundaries of the five folding domains are color coded as shown in Figures 4 and 5. The locations of helices and b-strands are indicated by the labels (H) and (B), respectively.

° (X-PLOR) are as follows: bond lengths 0.016 A, bond angles 1.9°, dihedral angles 24.8°, and improper angles 1.7°. The assignment of secondary structure to the amino acid sequence is given in Figure 2. The sequence of a-helices and b-strands indicates that OrnDC belongs to the a/b class of proteins (Levitt & Chothia, 1976) with about 38% of the amino acids in a-helices and 19% in b-strands. It has been demonstrated that inhibitor complexes of OrnDC ° diffract well beyond 2.5 A resolution when data are collected at a synchrotron source, so future improvement in the structure is anticipated (unpublished results). Description of the structure The OrnDC dodecamer is composed of six closely associated dimers (Figure 3). The dodecamer is ° ° donut shaped, 0210 A in diameter, 095 A in height ° and has a central hole 050 A in diameter. Each dimer consists of a tightly packed ``core'' plus protruding ``wing'' domains (Figure 4). The core of the OrnDC dimer is ellipsoidal with major and minor axes of ° ° 095 A and 065 A, respectively. The two subunits of a dimer are related by a non-crystallographic, quasi 2-fold axis, while the six dimers are related by a crystallographic 6-fold axis to form a dodecamer. There are extensive monomer/monomer contacts ° resulting in the loss of 012,900 A2 of solvent-access-

ible surface area that is buried upon dimer formation. There are two active sites per dimer, which are located at the bottom of deep clefts on opposite sides ° of the dimer about 30 A from the surface. This brings ° the Lys Ne atoms of the two active sites within 29 A of each other. The monomer can be described in terms of five, sequential folding domains (Figure 5): the N-terminal 107 residues (colored red in Figure 5) form the five-stranded b-sheet wing domain followed by a small linker domain (residues 108 to 160, orange); the third domain (yellow), residues 161 to 413 make up the PLP-binding scaffold; the final two domains (residues 414 to 569, green and 570 to 730, blue) create a cleft that leads to the active site. The OrnDC monomer can be likened to a left-handed baseball glove with the wing domain corresponding to the ``thumb'' portion and the remaining domains forming an open pocket that contains the PLP-binding site. The open nature of this PLP-binding pocket of the monomer is transformed into a deep cleft upon dimer formation, with the active site formed at the subunit interface. The wing domain is composed of a five-stranded, parallel b-sheet and four flanking a-helices. All crossovers are right-handed and all are made by helices except one. These domains are well isolated from the rest of the dimer, pointing into the central cavity region and contributing to the stabilization of

the dodecamer. The wing domain ends with a 19-residue helix (Ala88 to Ile106). The linker domain (orange, Figure 5) is composed of four, short ahelices with connecting loops and turns. This small domain contributes several residues that provide for subunit-subunit stabilization within the dimer. Most notably, residues 120' to 132'() of one subunit form a short b-strand and loop that fill in the upper portion of the active site of the other subunit (Figure 4). Interestingly, bracketing this short strand are residues Arg120' and Phe125' of OrnDC that occupy analogous roles to Arg43 and Phe48 in the structure of DGD, except that in DGD and AspAT this b-strand is contributed from the N terminus of the same subunit. Concerned about a possible error in the chain trace, both OMIT maps computed using phases with the entire linker domain removed and NED

maps were carefully examined. These maps support the interpretation that in OrnDC this b-strand is contributed from the second subunit in the dimer. The PLP-binding domain includes a sevenstranded a/b fold. The strands of the mixed b-sheet (yellow in Figure 5) have directions (+, -, +, +, +, +, +) with all crossovers being right-handed. The chain passes alternately through strands of sheet with connecting helices except between strands 6 and 7. The topology of the b-sheet is identical to that found in AspAT and DGD and all three structures bind the cofactor at the C-terminal end of the sheet. Connecting the second and third b-strands of this sheet is a short helix in OrnDC (Lys224 to Ala232). At the N terminus of this helix is His223 with its imidazole ring occupying the position corresponding to the indole ring of Trp140 in AspATs. Strand three begins immediately after this short helix in OrnDC and AspATs, but in the DGD the helix runs nearly perpendicular to that observed in OrnDC and

Figure 4. Stereo ribbon representation of the OrnDC dimer. An OrnDC dimer is shown with the five sequential folding domains of subunit A shown in red (wing domain, residues 1 to 107), orange (linker domain, residues 108 to 160), yellow (the PLP-binding domain, residues 161 to 413), green (domain 4, residues 414 to 569), and light blue (domain 5, residues 570 to 730) while subunit B is shown in purple. The location of the PLP-binding site is shown in ball-and-stick representation. The view shown is looking into the active site of subunit A with the molecular 2-fold axis nearly vertical as indicated.

there is also an insertion that forms a loop which fills a small portion of the space occupied by the C-terminal (fifth) domain in OrnDC. The fourth domain (green) extends from Gly414 to Asp569. This domain resembles the small domain of AspATs and DGD, but is significantly larger in OrnDC. Both OrnDC and AspAT begin this domain with a long helix (Gly414 to Ala438 in OrnDC), but the short b-strand that follows in AspAT is replaced by a meandering loop of over 50 amino acid residues in OrnDC (Gly439 to Pro493). The subsequent, three-stranded, antiparallel sheet in OrnDC (Asn494 to Thr500, Glu532 to Asp535 and Ser538 to Met543)

is similar to the remaining strands of the b-sheet seen in AspATs and DGD. Joining the first two strands in OrnDC is a loop, a short three-turn helix (Thr518 to Asp526) and another short b-strand that forms part of a two-stranded, parallel sheet that begins with Gly528 (analogous to Gly390 in DGD). The fifth domain (Ala570 to Asn730) contains seven helices and several short antiparallel b-sheets (blue). Residues 570 to 607 link the green and blue domains. The assignment of these residues to the blue domain instead of the green domain was based on the greater number of contacts these residues make with the rest of the blue domain. This carboxy-terminal domain

The active site Early in our crystallographic analysis, we recognized that one of OrnDC's major domains was structurally similar to the PLP-binding domain of

aspartate aminotransferase (Momany et al., 1992, 1995). Key residues associated with binding the PLP in the L30a OrnDC, as well as the corresponding residues in AspAT, are listed in Table 1. The active site of the L30a OrnDC is shown with density in Figure 6(a) and as a stick model in Figure 6(b). The PLP-scaffold generates a pocket well configured for binding PLP at the C-terminal end of the b-sheet. Clustered around the phosphate are numerous potential hydrogen bond donors, including six serine residues (Ser198, Ser199, Ser352, Ser364, Ser394', Ser396'), threonine (Thr395'), and the main-chain amide nitrogen atoms from Ser198 and

649 analysis shows clear homology in the PLP-binding domain with many other decarboxylases such as histidine and dopa decarboxylases, as well as with the aminotransferases (Momany et al., 1995). Interestingly, this homology does not extend to eukaryotic ODCs. In spite of the homology to aminotransferases, the use of sequence homology with the AATs led to an interesting mistake during the early model building of OrnDC. The L30a OrnDC and the E. coli AspAT have remarkable homology over a short peptide sequence in the PLP-binding pocket: L30a OrnDC E. coli AspAT

Ser199. Charge stabilization for the phosphate is provided by the imidazole side-chain of His354, part of the Ser-X-His-Lys(PXL) commonly associated with PLP-dependent decarboxylases, and the positive dipole arising from N-terminal end of the a-helix formed by residues Ser198 to Leu209. No other basic amino acid residues are present around the phosphate, i.e. there is no equivalent to Arg266 found in the aspartate aminotransferases. The active site of L30a OrnDC, like that of the AspATs, is located at the interface between monomers and consists of residues from both units. In the case of the L30a OrnDC, residues Ser394', Thr395' and Ser396' interact with the phosphate and, as noted above, Arg120' and Phe125' of OrnDC contain the short b-strand that fills in the active site and play analogous roles to Arg43 and Phe48 in the structure of DGD. The refined structure has continuous density from the pyridoxal ring to Lys355, confirming the presence of the internal aldimine form of the cofactor (see Figure 6(a)). The pyridinium ring sits in a pocket near the C-terminal end of the seven-stranded b-sheet with the plane of its ring nestled between His223 at the beginning of an a-helix and Ala318 from the center b-strand. Ala318 is highly conserved in decarboxylases and aminotransferases; its methyl group sits directly behind the pyridinium ring and is flanked on one side by Trp319 and on the other by Val350. The remainder of the residues that define the pocket are polar. The pyridinium nitrogen clearly forms a salt-bridge to Asp316. This aspartic acid is undoubtedly important in the electron redistribution during catalysis. The hydroxyl group of the PLP appears to be within hydrogen bonding distance of the indole nitrogen of Trp319. In the AATs, a tyrosine (Tyr70) hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl oxygen, but no equivalent hydrogen bond donor is present in the L30a OrnDC active site, though Tyr292 is nearby and aligned approximately coplanar to Trp319. The fourth domain may also contribute substrate specificity. Glu532 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the d-amino group of L-ornithine when substrate is modeled into the active site, but this assignment must await the analysis of inhibitor complexes. Glu697 is more distant along the channel that leads to the active site. No other acidic residues are nearby except for residues located below the pyridinium ring, which seem unlikely to participate in substrate binding. The position of this Glu532 would also be consistent with the postulated mode of substrate binding for the decarboxylases proposed by Gani (1991), since this would position the substrate on the re side of the cofactor nearest the phenolic oxygen.

Discussion
On the basis of its large subunit size, one might assume that the L30a OrnDC structure presented here is prototypical of only the large, bacterial PLP-dependent decarboxylases. However, in spite of the L30a OrnDC subunit being nearly twice the mass of most PLP-dependent decarboxylases, sequence

Although this homology and alignment appear convincing, the structure solution indicated that this sequence actually assumed a strikingly different structure in OrnDC and AspAT. There is a tworesidue shift, bringing His223 into the position where Trp140 normally would lie in the AATs (underlined residues; and see Figure 6(b)). The interpretation of the residues in this region is strongly supported by the NED map (Figure 6(a)) as well as the presence of a PtCl2- site at Met233. This should serve as a 4 cautionary note in building molecular models on the basis of sequence homology alone. While decarboxylases and aminotransferases tend to be based on dimeric units, higher oligomers, such as tetramers, decamers and dodecamers are not uncommon. The wing domain clearly contributes to those interactions in OrnDC that stabilize the dodecamer, but it does not form a tight, interlocking system as evidenced by the protein's susceptibility to dissociation at high pH values. Expression of a truncated form of OrnDC lacking the first 103 amino acid residues does not result in the production of active dimers of truncated OrnDC (M.L.H. & L. Zhang, unpublished data). This suggests that the wing domain is important in the formation of active enzyme and contributes in a more complex way than simply stabilizing the dimer-dimer contacts. Initially, we thought that this domain might serve as a nucleotide binding domain, since the end of the parallel pleated sheet could form a potential nucleotide binding site. In particular, if GTP were to bind there, and stabilize the dodecamer at high pH values, it would explain the increased activity of OrnDC in the presence of GTP at high pH. Surprisingly, GTP binds to this protein (at pH 5.8) at a surface location near the entrance to the active site (Momany et al., 1992; M.L.H. & D. W. Carrol, unpublished data), far from the wing domain. Assignment of function to the wing domain must await further study. The sequence Ser-X-His-Lys(Pxl) has long been recognized as being potentially significant because it is highly conserved among decarboxylases. Gani (1991) suggested that the histidine in this canonical sequence (His354 in OrnDC from L30a) serves three roles: first, to interact electrostatically with the substrate carboxyl to orient the Ca - COO- bond

650 perpendicular to the p-electron system of the cofactor, the optimal orientation for decarboxylation (Dunathan & Voet, 1974); second, to act as a base in deprotonating the e-ammonium group of the lysine residue prior to transaldimination; and third, to act as a proton donor at the Ca position. These proposed roles are based on a review of experimental evidence that included examination of the stereochemistry of the protonation and the abortive transamination reactions, as well as an examination of the active site peptides of a number of decarboxylases. With this knowledge, Gani (1991) developed a model of the decarboxylase active site based on the AspATs crystal structures. Our structure confirms the rationale of using AspAT as a model for this class of decarboxylases. In particular, the substrate binding mode appears correct in that the side-chain of the substrate will be placed on the re side of the cofactor oriented towards the hydroxyl side (left in Figure 6(b)) of the pyridinium ring. This will place the a-carboxylate group on the si side of the external aldimine (behind the cofactor in the view shown in Figure 6) and protected from solvent. The experimental evidence for a histidine located on the si face of the cofactor is compelling and is not ruled out by the L30a OrnDC crystal structure. However, the canonical histidine is not always conserved as earlier assumed by Gani (1991). More recent sequence data show that serine, a good hydrogen bond donor for interaction with the PLP phosphate, replaces this histidine in the mouse and human histidine decarboxylase amino acid sequences. The replacement of a serine for a histidine would be acceptable for phosphate binding, but not as the proton donor/acceptor for catalysis. Futhermore, mutation of the equivalent histidine in the Morganella HDC (His231) to glutamine produces a decarboxylase that retains 10% of the original native activity (Vaaler & Snell, 1989). If a similar glutamine were modeled in this position in the L30a OrnDC active site, its side-chain could orient such that the amide nitrogen of the amino acid side-chain could hydrogen bond to the phosphate of the cofactor. An asparagine at this position has no activity in the Morganella HDC (Vaaler & Snell, 1989) and thus may not form as effective a hydrogen bond network. The assignment of mechanistic roles for residues on the basis of pH profiles and chemical modification studies can be misleading. Experimental analysis of the catalytic mechanism of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase suggested that a residue with a pKa near that of an imidizole should be involved as a proton donor in the decarboxylation reaction. No histidine was found in the active site; instead it is likely that a glutamic acid with a shifted pKa serves as the proton donor (Gallagher et al., 1989). His223 of OrnDC is positioned just below the Schiff base on the re face of the cofactor (see Figure 6) in an accessible position. This histidine is a more likely target for histidinyl-specific reagents that inactivate some of the decarboxylases than is His354 (Mishin & Sukhareva, 1986). Jackson (1990) observed that the histidine, equivalent to His223 in the L30a OrnDC,

L30a OrnDC Structure

was conserved in all the decarboxylases analyzed. All the related decarboxylases reported by Momany et al. (1995), with the possible exception of the E. coli glutamate decarboxylase, have this conserved histidine. The results reported here are for a model of holo OrnDC at pH 5.8. Conformational changes are known to occur during substrate binding in the aminotransferases and the same probably occur with the L30a OrnDC as suggested by the observation that crystals crack upon binding inhibitors. A conformational change might release His354 from the phosphate, or alternatively, bring the Ca of the substrate into position closer to His223. Most likely Lys355, located behind the external aldimine, serves as the proton donor to replace the leaving CO2 group. However, solvent may also play an active role in catalysis. The active site histidine, His354 (or His223), may function indirectly by orienting and polarizing a solvent molecule to participate in catalysis. Along these lines, the open structure of the L30a OrnDC suggests that the Ca should be exposed to solvent attack from the re side of the cofactor (see Figures 4 and 6). However, substrate binding might cause conformational changes that would protect this side from protonation. While OrnDC and the dialkylglycine decarboxylase (Toney et al., 1995) also share a common PLPbinding domain, the residues that populate the active site have significant differences. The substrate carboxylate is oriented by an arginine in DGD (Arg406), but in ODC Tyr292 projects into the equivalent space creating a hydrophobic pocket. No carboxylate is positioned in OrnDC to provide the electrostatic destabilization equivalent to Gln52 in DGD. In fact, other than His223 or His354 possibly playing this role in OrnDC, there is no likely candidate for orientation or interaction with the substrate carboxylate. Furthermore, while the OrnDC-like PLP-dependent decarboxylase sequences have histidine at the position equivalent to His223 in OrnDC (Momany et al., 1995), DGD and AspAT both have tryptophan residues (Trp140 in AspAT and Trp138 in DGD). Especially surprising is the difference in the arrangements of the helices that follow these residues. In DGD, the helix orients almost perpendicular to the corresponding helix in ODC. The fifth domain of OrnDC sits in the corresponding position of this helix in DGD and thus prevents any such arrangement in OrnDC. These differences between OrnDC and DGD may arise from DGD's dual functionality in having both decarboxylation and transamination activities. Further discussions about the active site and mechanism of action of this decarboxylase must await the analysis of inhibitor complexes, which will also provide higher resolution data. Besides OrnDC, crystals of dopa decarboxylase (Malashkevich et al., 1992) and arginine decarboxylase (Rodriguez et al., 1994) have also been reported. The structures of these decarboxylases have the potential of leading to the design of improved anticancer and antiparasitic treatments (ornithine decarboxylases), antihis-

Methods
Preparation and crystallization L30a ornithine decarboxylase protein and crystals were prepared as previously described (Momany & Hackert, 1989). Crystals were mounted in artificial mother liquor consisting of 7% (w/v) PEG 8000, 50 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% b-octylglucoside, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 , 200 mM pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (pH 5.8). Apo-OrnDC was prepared by the method of Guirard & Snell (1980) and crystallized under native conditions supplemented with 0.8 mM putrescine. Mersalyl and K2 PtCl4 derivatives were prepared as described (Stoops et al., 1991). A HgAc2 derivative was prepared by growing crystals in the presence of 1 mM HgAc2 in the crystallization well solution. The (AET)2 Hg derivative was prepared by soaking OrnDC crystals for two days in 0.1 mM di(aminoethylthio)mercury (Withers et al., 1979) dissolved in artificial mother liquor. X-ray data processing Reflection intensities were collected at room temperature on a Hamlin-Xuong type area detector (San Diego MultiWire Systems, Inc.) using monochromated (graphite) CuKa radiation produced by an Elliott GX-20 rotating anode generator operated at 35 kV, 35 mA. Data processing was as described previously (Parks et al., 1985). Each data set was collected from a single crystal. The native data set ° is 86% complete from 8.0 to 3.0 A resolution and 70% ° complete in the outer shell from 3.13 to 3.00 A resolution. Data statistics for the native, apo, and the four derivatives are shown in Table 2. Structure determination ° The generation of the initial 3.5 A resolution electron density map has been described (Stoops et al., 1991). MIR phases were calculated from the platinum and mersalyl derivatives (overall figure of merit, 0.5) and the electron density improved by the method of Wang (1985). No attempt was made to optimize the solvent content used in calculating the mask by starting out with a lower solvent

percentage and then increasing it in steps as was done in solving the tryptophan synthase structure (Hyde et al., 1988). Although the general shape of the OrnDC molecule was clearly defined, the initial MIR map was of poor quality even though the difference Patterson maps were readily interpretable and difference-Fourier maps clearly identified heavy atom sites for the platinum and mersalyl derivatives. Nonetheless, the electron density map that resulted from the Wang procedure was encouraging since secondary features were clearly visible and a polyalanyl backbone was built into this electron density. However, fitting a model to this map was not possible due to the initial lack of amino acid sequence information. ° The 3.5 A resolution map was further improved by a density modification procedure involving a cyclic process of 2-fold symmetry averaging (Bricogne, 1976), solvent flattening, and phase extension. All maps were computed ° on a grid of 192 × 192 × 96 (01 A). The initial 2-fold symmetry axis was obtained from a least-squares analysis of the platinum and mersalyl heavy atom sites that had 2-fold related mates. The refinement of the symmetry axis for symmetry averaging was performed using LSQROT (J. Smith, Purdue Univ.) which was modified to work with space group P6. Only electron density points within a ° sphere 35 A from a point centrally located within the OrnDC dimer were used in the symmetry axis refinement. To conserve the mathematics involved in calculating the derivatives, the calculation of the dr/dy was changed from dr/dy(x, y, z) = (r(x, y + 1, z) - r(x, y - 1, z)/2Dy to dr/ dy(x, y, z) = (r(x + 1, y + 1, z) + r(x, y + 1, z))/2 - (r(x - 1, y - 1, z) + r(x, y - 1, z))/2)/2Dy cos 60. The initial molecular envelope defined by the method of Wang was abandoned in favor of an atomic mask using a ° 4 A radius cutoff around atoms that had been previously positioned in electron density. The first atomic mask was based on the polyalanine model fitted to the 3.5° map and was updated as the model improved. Phase combination was performed using Hendrickson-Lattman (1970) coefficients obtained from the MIR phasing. The Fobs were scaled to Fcalc in resolution bins employing the method of Read (1986). All heavy atom derivative phasing information available (HgAc2 and (AET)2 Hg derivatives added) was included in the MIR phases (overall figure of merit 0.44 to ° 3.0 A). A cycle of density modification consisted of the following steps: (1) refinement of the position of the 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis; (2) 2-fold averaging within the atomic mask; (3) solvent flattening of the symmetry averaged map; (4) back transformation; (5) phase recombination of the calculated phases with the MIR

minimization, simulated annealing, and individual temperature factor refinement features of X-PLOR (see Table 3). After each round of refinement, 2Fobs - Fcalc , Fobs - Fcalc , X-PLOR ``omit'' maps (Brunger, 1992), or ¨ ``NED'' (Kolatkar et al., 1992) maps were used for model ° rebuilding. Refinement using data from 8 to 2.9 A resolution was carried out with a 4s cutoff (36,972 reflections). A testament to the quality of the model came from our ability to identify errors in the amino acid sequence derived from the L30a OrnDC gene sequence, particularly in the less biased NED maps. Poor agreement with the electron density led to the discovery of three omitted nucleotides in the gene sequence, resulting in an additional amino acid and residue changes over the region 652 to 664. Solvent molecules were selected from well-shaped peaks greater than 3s in NED and difference Fourier maps that were within hydrogen bonding distance of either a side-chain or main-chain protein atom hydrogen bond donors or acceptors. Solvent molecules that had large shifts ° in X, Y, Z positions (greater than 1.0 A in two directions), a large temperature factor after energy minimization, or poor density were removed from the solvent list. A total of only 107 solvent molecules are in the present model of OrnDC. Coordinates for ornithine decarboxylase have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank, 1ORN.

coefficients; (6) calculation of cycle statistics; and finally (7) calculation of a new electron density map using the recombined phases and figure-of-merit weighted Fobs for the next cycle. Five cycles of least-squares symmetry axis refinement were performed for every cycle of density modification. This was then reduced to two cycles of axis refinement for every cycle as the position of the axis appeared well defined. Symmetry axis refinement probably contributed little to improving map quality since the 2-fold axis moved only a total of 0.2° from its starting position, corresponding to a net change of ° 0.3 A at the extremes of the OrnDC asymmetric unit. The angles defining the molecular symmetry axis converged to within a few hundredths of a degree of their final values after the first 30 cycles of refinement (data not shown). Density modification consisted of 20 cycles each at 3.50, ° 3.44, 3.38, 3.32, 3.26 and 3.21 A resolution (extension by approximately one reciprocal lattice point). The low ° resolution data cutoff was initially set to 12 A resolution, ° but at cycle 53 was changed to 20 A resolution. Con° tinuation beyond 3.21 A resulted in poorer statistics and degradation of map quality, thus a model was built into the density map resulting from 100 cycles of density modification. This model was then used to compute a final atomic mask for 20 additional cycles of density ° modification at 3.26 A resolution. The atomic model used to begin refinement was built into this electron density map. The discovery that part of the polyalanine model of OrnDC resembled aspartate aminotransferase enabled the use of sequence homology between AspAT and OrnDC to establish connectivity and register of available amino acid sequence in that region. The a-carbon chain of the E. coli AspAT K258A mutant (Kamitori et al., 1988) was aligned, manually, with the L30a OrnDC polyalanyl backbone so that the seven-stranded b-sheet and associated helices of AspAT superimposed. This transformation also superimposed the pyridoxal-phosphate of AspAT with the two major difference density peaks in a holo-minus-apo electron density map (data not shown). All of the model building was done using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). Residues were also placed into regions of electron density that were not readily interpretable so that this volume would also be included in the atomic mask generated for subsequent solvent flattening. The autogenerate feature of O was used to first add main-chain atoms, then side-chains, and these were adjusted into electron density. The initial chain trace had significant errors but proved extremely useful for construction of the atomic mask used with the density modification procedure. This led to the map used in model building of the whole structure as the complete sequence became available (Hackert et al., 1994). Crystallographic refinement Crystallographic refinement was performed using X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987) on a CRAY Y-MP8/864. To ¨ minimize van der Waals' overlap resulting from the initial model building that caused difficulty in determining the initial crystallographic weighting term for X-PLOR, the core portion of one subunit was minimized (50 cycles Powell) using the crystallographic refinement routine in QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.) without structure factor restraints. The 2-fold related residues for the other subunit were then generated from these ``relaxed'' residues. Both subunits of OrnDC were generally refined independently without 2-fold restraints using the energy
