5GGU GGA GGCU A previous NMR structure of the duplex PCCG AAG CCG5 revealed an unusually stable RNA internal loop with three consecutive sheared GA pairs. Here, we report NMR studies of two duplexes, 5GGU GGA GGCU 5GGU GAA GGCU (replacing the UG pair with a UA closing pair) and PCCG AAG CCG5 (replacing the middle PCCA AAG CCG5 GA pair with an AA pair). An unusually stable loop with three consecutive sheared GA pairs forms in the 5GGU GGA GGCU duplex PCCA AAG CCG5. The structure contrasts with that reported for this loop in the crystal structure of the large ribosomal subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans [Harms, J., Schluenzen, F., Zarivach, R., Bashan, A., Gat, S., Agmon, I., Bartels, H., Franceschi, F., and Yonath, A. (2001) Cell 107, 679-688]. The middle 5GGU GAAGGCU AA pair in the duplex PCCG AAG CCG5 rapidly exchanges orientations, resulting in alternative base stacking and pseudosymmetry with exclusively sheared pairs. The U GAA G internal loop is 2.1 kcal/mol less stable G AAG C than the U GGA G internal loop at 37 °C. Structural, energetic, and dynamic consequences upon functional G AAG C group substitutions within related 3 × 3 and 3 × 6 internal loops are also reported.

ABSTRACT:

Noncanonical pairs within the internal loops of RNA are important elements for folding and function. Understanding the sequence-dependent folding free energy and dynamics of internal loops can facilitate prediction of structure (1, 2), dynamics, and functional significance from sequence. AA and GA can form isosteric sheared-type (trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A-A or A-G) noncanonical pairs (Figure 1a) (3-9). Typically, the AA pair is thermodynamically destabilizing, but the GA pair is stabilizing (7, 9-13). Depending on the sequence context, GA often forms a sheared pair, but AA is more flexible (Figure 1). Two A's can potentially switch base pairing orientation in a sheared AA pair (i.e., trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A1-A2 or A2-A1) without the loss of base-base hydrogen bonding. In a sheared GA pair, the equivalent interchange of bases would result in the loss of the two hydrogen bonds between G and A in a sheared GA pair. 5GGU GGA GGCU The duplex PCCG AAG CCG5 (P1 is a purine riboside) contains an unusually stable and relatively abundant internal loop, GGA (9). The NMR structure of this duplex reveals AAG three consecutive sheared GA pairs (trans Hoogsteen/sugar

edge A-G) with separate stacks of three G's (G4, G5, and G14 in the major groove) and three A's (A6, A15, and A16 in the minor groove), which are closed by wobble UG (cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick U-G) and Watson-Crick CG pairs (9). (Throughout the paper, each top strand is written from 5 to 3 in going from left to right. Numbering starts at the left-most (5) nucleotide of the top strand and ends at the left-most (3) nucleotide of the bottom strand.) Helix 68 of the crystal structure of the large ribosomal U GGA G subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans contains a A AAG C loop that has only one sheared GA pair (shown in bold) (14). There is less hydrogen bonding, and the base stacking pattern is equivalent to the A6/G5/A16 pattern in the minor groove instead of the A6/A15/A16 pattern found in the NMR structure for the equivalent loop with a UG rather than UA closing pair. Here, we report NMR and thermodynamic studies of GGU GGA GGCU GGU GAA GGCU (A17 duplex) and PCCG AAG CCG (A5 duplex) PCCA AAG CCG to determine the effects of replacing a UG closing pair with UA and a middle GA pair with AA, respectively, relative to GGU GGA GGCU (3GA duplex) (Figure 2). NMR restrained PCCG AAG CCG molecular dynamics reveals a conformation of three conGGU GGA GGCU secutive sheared GA pairs for the loop in PCCA AAG CCG . A5 GGU GAA GGCU and A15 in PCCG AAG CCG rapidly exchange positions, forming alternative sheared AA pairs (i.e., exchanging between

FIGURE 1: Schematic representation of (a) different sheared pairs and (b) a GA pair and various AA pairs mentioned in this paper. The hydrogen bonds between base and backbone are not shown. Note that two conformations with one base-base hydrogen bond are possible for a sheared AA pair because the amino group of either A can form the hydrogen bond.

trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A15-A5 and trans Hoogsteen/ sugar edge A5-A15) flanked by sheared GA pairs. The exchanging AA pair results in alternative A6/A15/A16 or A6/A5/A16 base stacking in the minor groove. The flexibility of alternative orientations of a middle adenine base edge in the minor groove, i.e., from A15 (N3-C2-N1) (as also GGU GGA GGCU GGU GGA GGCU observed in PCCG AAG CCG and PCCA AAG CCG ) to A5 (N1C2-N3), might provide switching between different binding partners for dynamic functions. Functional group substitutions (atomic mutations) have been extensively used for studying elements of molecular recognition in RNA (10, 15-24). Here, the structural, energetic, and dynamic consequences of functional group substitutions are explored by studying duplexes GGU GRA of the form PCCG AQG GGCU, where R and Q are various CCG purine nucleotides (Figures 1a and 2). Single predominant conformations form in the a5, P5, I5, and I15 duplexes. Functional group substitutions also facilitate interpretation of NMR data. The thermodynamic effects of functional

group substitutions within 3 × 6 internal loops are also reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Purification. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using the phosphoramidite method (25, 26) and purified as described previously (9, 12). CPG supports and phosphoramidites were acquired from Proligo, Glen Research, or ChemGenes. The mass of all oligonucleotides was verified by ESI-MS with a Hewlett-Packard 1100 LC/MS Chemstation. Purities were checked by reverse phase HPLC or analytical TLC on a Baker Si500F silica gel plate (250 µm thick), and all were greater than 95% pure. UV Melting Experiments and Thermodynamics. Concentrations of single-stranded oligonucleotides were calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm and 80 °C and extinction coefficients predicted from those of dinucleotide monophosphates and nucleosides (27, 28) with RNAcalc (http:// www.meltwin.com) (29). The extinction coefficients were

The equation G°37 ) H° - (310.15)S° was used to calculate the free energy change at 37 °C (310.15 K). NMR Sample Preparation. With minor modification, sample preparation was similar to that previously reported (7, 9). The sample buffer included 80 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 mM disodium EDTA at pH 5.1 for GGU GAA GGCU H2O and pD 7.3 for D2O for PCCG AAG CCG and pH 5.4 for H2O and pD 6.8 for D2O for proton spectra at pH 6.0 similar to those at pH 5.1. Moreover, chemical shifts and critical loop NOEs involving nonexchangeable protons were essentially the same in water at pH 5.1 and pD 7.3. Total volumes were 300 µL with a 90/10 (v/v) H2O/D2O mixture for exchangeable proton spectra and 99.996% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for nonexchangeable spectra. The total duplex concentrations were 2 mM. The total duplex concentrations of other sequences were 0.51.2 mM. NMR Spectroscopy. Unless otherwise noted, all exchangeable and nonexchangeable proton spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz (1H) spectrometer (33). Onedimensional imino proton spectra were acquired with an S pulse sequence (33) with a sweep width of 12 kHz and temperatures ranging from 0 to 55 °C. SNOESY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms at 5 and 30 °C. NOESY spectra of samples in D2O were acquired at 30 °C with mixing times of 100, 200, and 400 ms. TOCSY spectra were acquired at 30 °C with mixing times of 8, 20, and 40 ms. Natural abundance 1H-13C HMQC spectra for GGU GAA GGCU GGU GGA GGCU and PCCA AAG CCG were acquired with a PCCG AAG CCG 5000 Hz spectral width for proton and a 15 000 Hz spectral width for carbon. The 1H-31P HETCOR and natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 600 MHz (1H) spectrometer. The one-dimensional 1Hdecoupled 31P spectra (referenced to an external standard of 85% H3PO4 at 0 ppm) were acquired on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz (1H) spectrometer at 30 °C. Proton spectra were referenced to H2O or HDO at a known temperaturedependent chemical shift relative to 3-(trimethylsilyl)tetradeuterosodium propionate (TSP). The Felix (2000) software package (Molecular Simulations Inc.) was used to process two-dimensional spectra. Restraint Generation. Very similar restraints were genGGU GGA GGCU erated for PCCA AAG CCG (Table S1 of the Supporting InGGU GGA GGCU formation) like they were for PCCG AAG CCG (9). For GGU GAA GGCU GGU GGA GGCU and PCCA AAG CCG , 15 hydrogen bond rePCCG AAG CCG straints limiting proton and hydrogen bond acceptor distances to 1.8-2.5 Å were applied for the five Watson-Crick GC pairs, but no hydrogen bond restraints were used within the loop and UG or UA pair. Dihedral angles of residues in the Watson-Crick stems and UG or UA pair were loosely restrained: 0 ( 120° for R, 180 ( 30° for , 60 ( 30° for , 85 ( 30° for , -140 ( 40° for , 0 ( 120° for ( was mistakenly given as in ref 9), and -170 ( 40° for .

estimated by replacing purine riboside, 2,6-diaminopurine riboside, deoxyadenosine, and 2-O-methyladenosine with adenosine and replacing inosine and deoxyguanosine with guanosine. Although extinction coefficients differ with functional group substitutions, individual nucleotides contribute only a small portion of the oligomer extinction and thus do not significantly affect thermodynamic measurements. UV melting buffer included 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.5 mM disodium EDTA (pH 7) or 80 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 0.5 mM disodium EDTA (pH 7). Curves of absorbance at 280 nm versus temperature were acquired using a heating rate of 1 °C/min with a Beckman Coulter DU640C spectrophotometer having a Peltier temperature controller. Melting curves were fit to a two-state model with MeltWin (http://www.meltwin.com), assuming linear sloping baselines and temperature-independent H° and S° (29-31). Additionally, the temperature at which half the strands are in a duplex, TM, at a total strand concentration, CT, was used to calculate thermodynamic parameters for non-self-complementary duplexes according to (32)

For the structural GGU GGA GGCU modeling of PCCA AAG CCG , the  dihedral angle for G5 was restrained to be C2-endo with  (160 ( 30°), and for A6, G14, U10, and P20, the  dihedral angles were restrained to cover both C2-endo and C3-endo conformations with  (122.5 ( 67.5°). Two sets of distance and dihedral angle restraints (set I, A6/A15/A16; and set II, A6/A5/A16) were run for GGU GAA GGCU because NOEs were inconsistent with a PCCG AAG CCG single structure. The previous NMR structure of GGU GGA GGCU (9) facilitated segregation of restraints for PCCG AAG CCG structural modeling. For interproton distance restraints that differ for A6/A15/A16 and A6/A5/A16 structural modeling, lower and upper bounds were loosened; all other restraints are the same for sets I and II (Table S2 of the Supporting Information). Two sets of  dihedral angle restraints were generated for loop residues (G4, A5, A6, G14, A15, and A16) in GGU GAAGGCU . For set I (A6/A15/A16), the  dihedral angle PCCG AAG CCG for A5 was restrained to be C2-endo with  (160 ( 30°), and all other loop residues and the two 3-dangling residues, U10 and P20, were restrained to cover both C2-endo and C3-endo conformations with  (122.5 ( 67.5°). For set II (A6/A5/A16), all the loop residues were restrained to cover both C2-endo and C3-endo conformations, with the other dihedral angle restraints being the same as those of set I (A6/ GGU GGA GGCU A15/A16) and PCCA AAG CCG . In summary, a total of 222 distance restraints (110 intranucleotide and 112 internucleotide), including hydrogen bond restraints, and 98 dihedral angle restraints were used GGU GGA GGCU for the structural modeling of PCCA AAG CCG (Table S1 of the Supporting Information). For the structural modeling of GGU GAA GGCU , a total of 250 distance restraints (128 intraPCCG AAG CCG nucleotide and 122 internucleotide), including hydrogen bond restraints, and 98 dihedral angle restraints were used for the structural modeling of set I (A6/A15/A16), and a total of 249 distance restraints (128 intranucleotide and 121 internucleotide), including hydrogen bond restraints, and 98 dihedral angle restraints were used for the structural modeling of set II (A6/A5/A16) (Table S2 of the Supporting Information). Structural Modeling. NMR restrained molecular dynamics and energy minimization were carried out with the Discover 98 package on a Silicon Graphics computer. An A-form like RNA starting structure was generated with the Biopolymer module of Insight II (2000). The AMBER 95 force field (34) was used with addition of flat-bottom restraint pseudopotentials, with force constants of 25 kcal mol-1 Å-2 for NOE distance restraints and 50 kcal mol-1 rad-2 for torsion angle restraints and with a maximum force of 1000 kcal/mol. Group-based summation with an 18 Å cutoff was used for calculating van der Waals interactions. The cell-multipole method (35), with a distance-dependent dielectric constant ( ) 2r), was used for calculating electrostatic interactions. The progression of the structure simulation was the same as previously reported (7, 9, 17). Several figures were generated with PyMOL (36). RESULTS Functional Group Substitutions and Thermodynamics of Molecular Recognition. Measured thermodynamic parameters

Chen et al. for several duplexes and internal loops with and without functional group substitutions are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Most were measured at 1 M NaCl to allow comparison to existing databases, but four were also measured in the 80 mM NaCl buffer used for most NMR experiments. The lower salt concentration makes duplex formation less favorable on average by 3.41 ( 0.15 kcal/ mol at 37 °C, which is consistent with a sequenceindependent salt effect. Measured thermodynamic parameters for formation of the internal loops (Table 2) are calculated according to the following equation which relies on the nearest neighbor model for predicting duplex stability (37):

H°loop and S°loop are calculated similarly. All the thermodynamic parameters used in this calculation are derived from TM-1 versus ln(CT/4) plots (eq 1). When eq 2a was applied to 2 × 2 nucleotide internal loops of noncanonical pairs flanked by different stems, the values for G°37,loop for a given loop sequence differed by an average of 0.40 kcal/mol (2). The model should be even better for sequences with identical stems. Functional Group Substitutions, NMR Assignments, and Structural Features. The base-(H1/H5) "NOESY walk" regions of the 400 ms NOESY spectra at 30 °C are shown in Figure 3. NMR resonances were assigned essentially as described previously (7, 9, 38, 39). Comparison of spectra GGU GGA GGCU with those of the duplex PCCG AAG CCG (9) facilitates NMR GGU GGA GGCU GGU GAA GGCU assignments of PCCA AAG CCG and PCCG AAG CCG (see Tables S1-S3 of the Supporting Information for assignments and restraints used for structural modeling). GGU GGA GGCU U3A17 in PCCA AAG CCG forms a Watson-Crick pair as indicated by a strong NOE between U3H3 and A17H2. The imino proton, U3H3, is relatively broad and shifted upfield (12.53 ppm) (13) relative to the usual range of 13-15 ppm for a Watson-Crick UA pair. A similar upfield shift (11.75 ppm) was observed in the 2 × 2 loop U GA A (40). Three A AG U GGU GGA GGCU consecutive sheared GA pairs form in PCCA AAG CCG , as in GGU GGA GGCU (Figures 4 and 5a) (9). Several medium to PCCG AAG CCG strong NOEs, which are similar to NOEs observed for GGU GGA GGCU , define the loop structure, e.g., G14H2PCCG AAG CCG G5H1, A6H1-A15H2, A15H1-A6H2, A16H1-A15H2, G7H1-A6H2, and A17H1-A16H2 (compare to G17H1GGU GGA GGCU A16H2 in PCCG AAG CCG ) (Figure 3a and Table 3) (9). In the U GGA G loop of A AAG C , G4 and G5 have C3-endo and C2-endo sugar puckers, respectively, and G14 is populated in both conformations as evidenced by TOCSY (Figure S1a of the

Also, the NOEs of G14H1/ GGU GAA GGCU H2-A5H2 in PCCG AAG CCG (Figure 3b) are similar to GGU GGA GGCU those of G14H1/H2-G5H1 as present for PCCG AAG CCG GGU GGA GGCU (9) and PCCA AAG CCG (Table S1). Both sets of NOEs, G14H1/H2-I5H2 and G14H1/H2-I5H1 (data not shown), GGU GIA GGCU are observed in the I5 duplex, PCCG AAG CCG (Figure 3e). The chemical shift of I5H1, 12.1 ppm (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information), is in agreement with the formation

of a sheared IA pair (41). Downfield chemical shifts for inosine imino protons beyond 14 ppm were observed in faceto-face IA pairs (4, 42). While comparison of NOESY spectra (Figure 3, Table 3, and Table S2 of the Supporting Information) indicates very similar base pairing and stacking geometries with three GGU GaA GGCU sheared-type purine-purine pairs for PCCG AAG CCG (a5 duGGU GPA GGCU GGU GIA GGCU plex), PCCG AAG CCG (P5 duplex), and PCCG AAG CCG (I5

duplex), the NMR spectra provide evidence for two populaGGU GAA GGCU tions of structures for the middle A5A15 pair in PCCG AAG CCG (A5 duplex) (Figures 5b and 6). For example, in addition to NOEs of R5H2-G14H1/H2 (R is any purine), A6H2A15H1, A15H2-A6H1, and A15H2-A16H1 (denoted with yellow circles and ovals) for the a5, P5, and I5 duplexes, one extra set of NOEs A15H2-G4H1/H2, A16H2-A5H1, A5H2-A16H1, and A5H2-A6H1 (denoted with green GGU GAA GGCU circles and ovals) are present for PCCG AAG CCG (Figure 3). Moreover, on the basis of TOCSY (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information) and NOESY (Figure 3) spectra, sugar puckers of a5, P5, and I5 are C2-endo as indicated by strong H1-H2 couplings (G 8 Hz), which corresponds to the C2-endo conformation of the G5 sugar pucker in GGU GGA GGCU (9). Sugar puckers for A15 are C3-endo in PCCG AAG CCG each of these duplexes with the possible exception of the a5 GGU GAA GGCU duplex. For PCCG AAG CCG , however, A5 and A15 are populated in both C2-endo and C3-endo conformations with A5 having a greater C2-endo population than A15. Evidently, the middle A5A15 pair is more populated in trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A15-A5 than in trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A5-A15 and related conformations. This is in agreement with NOEs (Figure 3b) observed for A5H2-G14H1/H2, A6H2-A15H1, A15H2-A6H1, and A15H2-A16H1 (denoted with yellow circles and ovals) being relatively stronger than NOEs A15H2-G4H1/H2, A16H2-A5H1, A5H2A16H1, and A5H2-A6H1 (denoted with green circles and GGU GAA GGCU ovals), respectively, in PCCG AAG CCG . The presence of a GGU GAA GGCU single set of chemical shifts for PCCG AAG CCG indicates that the middle A5A15 pair is alternating rapidly (fast exchange on the NMR time scale), with the sugar edge of either A5 or A15 on the base pairing edge of the other, forming trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A15-A5 (denoted with yellow) or A5A15 (denoted with green) and related pairs (Figure 5b). NMR spectra acquired at 1 M NaCl indicate that the structural and dynamical properties of the A5 loop are similar at 80 mM and 1 M NaCl (Figures 3b and S3, respectively). Chemical shifts show an only modest salt dependence, and the same pattern of NOEs for the major and minor confor-

mations is observed, including the A5H2-A15H8 (major) and A15H2-A5H8 (minor) cross-peaks (data not shown). Relatively downfield chemical shifts of H2 protons on the base pairing edge (Figure 1) are observed: 9.30 ppm for P5H2 [compared to 8.16 ppm for P20H2 (9)], 8.44 ppm for a5H2 (compared to 7.57 ppm for A15H2 in the a5 duplex), GGU GPA GGCU GGU GaA GGCU and 8.69 ppm for I5H2 in PCCG AAG CCG , PCCG AAG CCG , and GGU GIA GGCU , respectively (Figure 3 and Table 4). Such PCCG AAG CCG downfield chemical shifts of H2 on the base pairing edge of sheared purine-purine pairs are expected due to ring current deshielding effects (Figure 1a), as observed previously in 2 GGC AA GGCU × 2 loops: 8.19 ppm for A4H2 in UCCG AA CCG (compared to 7.88 ppm for A5H2, which is not on a base pairing edge) GGC PA GGCU and 8.97 ppm for P4H2 in UCCG AP CCG (18). On the edge that is not base paired, relatively upfield chemical shifts of H2 protons are observed. A15H2 chemical GGU GPA GGCU shifts are 7.69, 7.57, and 7.55 ppm in PCCG AAG CCG , GGU GaA GGCU GGU GIA GGCU , and PCCG AAG CCG , respectively (Figure 3 PCCG AAG CCG and Table 4). These can be compared to the relatively further upfield chemical shifts of 7.13 and 7.16 ppm for A15H2 GGU GGA GGCU GGU GGA GGCU protons in PCCG AAG CCG and PCCA AAG CCG , respectively, which might reflect stronger base pairing and better stacking of the motif with three consecutive sheared GA pairs, resulting in larger ring current shielding effects from A6 and A16. Intermediate chemical shifts of A5H2 (8.28 ppm) and GGU GAA GGCU A15H2 (7.83 ppm) are observed in PCCG AAG CCG , which is consistent with a rapidly alternating sheared A5A15 pair (Table 4).

The I15 duplex provides further evidence for two structures of the A5 duplex. Several features in the NMR spectra suggest that the loop conformation in the I15 duplex is most similar to the less populated conformation observed in the

A5 duplex. NOEs observed in the I15 duplex that were weak in A5 duplex and not observed at all in a5, P5, or I5 duplexes include 15H2-G4H1, A16H2-5H1, 5H2-A16H1, 5H2A6H1, and 15H2-5H8 (Figure 3). NOEs not observed in

FIGURE 6: Major groove stereoviews of two alternating structures GGU GAA GGCU of PCCG AAG CCG with A6/A15/A16 or A6/A5/A16 stacks in the minor groove. Two G's and four A's in the loop are colored red and green, respectively. Hydrogen and nonbridging oxygen atoms were omitted for clarity. The hydrogen bonding shown for the AA pair in the minor conformation is similar to that shown in Figure 1a, but a variety of hydrogen bonding patterns are seen in the ensemble of structures generated with the restraints from NMR data.
GGU GAA GGCU the I15 duplex but observed in PCCG AAG CCG and all other duplexes include 5H2-G14H1, A6H2-15H1, 15H2A6H1, and 15H2-A16H1. The relatively downfield chemical shift of I15H2 (8.55 ppm) and the relatively upfield shift of A5H2 (7.51 ppm) are consistent with those protons being at the A5-I15 base pairing edge and out in the minor groove, respectively, as discussed for the other duplexes (Table 4). A strong scalar coupling (8 Hz), I15H1-H2, and a large downfield 31P shift of A16 (2.75 ppm) indicate a C2-endo ribose conformation at I15 (13, 40). In contrast, A5H1H2 scalar coupling is much weaker and the 31P shift of A6 is 1.10 ppm. These contrast with a5, P5, and I5 duplexes which show strong 5H1-H2 coupling (G 8 Hz) and weak 15H1-H2 coupling. Moreover, 31P shifts of I5 duplex are 0.86 and 2.58 ppm for A16 and A6, respectively. Additionally, the G4H1-H2 and G14H1-H2 couplings are moderate and zero, respectively, in the I15 duplex, while they are

zero and moderate, respectively, in a5, P5, and I5 duplexes. The moderate couplings probably indicate dynamic interconversion of sugar puckers. The 31P chemical shifts for the A5 duplex are 1.41 and 2.20 ppm for A16 and A6, respectively, which suggest that the A5 duplex is more populated in a conformation similar to a5, P5, and I5 duplexes. As described above, there is a large chemical shift difference between the H2 resonances for the central purinepurine pairs, and the line widths of these resonances are consistent with two rapidly interconverting structures for the A5 duplex (Table 4). The line widths for A5H2 and A15H2 are both 14 Hz for the A5 duplex. In contrast, the H2 resonance not at the base pairing edge in a5, P5, I5, and I15 duplexes has an average line width of 4.75 ( 1.0 Hz, which is approximately the same as the average of the stem resonance G2H8 (4.1 ( 0.5 Hz). This is consistent with a model in which duplexes having a single conformation have a relatively narrow line width, while the A5 duplex resonances are broadened due to switching between two conformations. The base pairing edge H2 resonance in a5, P5, I5, and I15 duplexes has average line width of 10.2 ( 2.3 Hz. This may indicate that this residue is slightly less stable than the pairing partner on the other strand and/or that the chemical shift of the proton in this position is more sensitive to slight structural fluctuations.

A total of 27 of 40 modeled structures (PDB entry 2DD2) were selected for analysis of the A6/A15/A16 structure of GGU GAA GGCU . The average root-mean-square deviation of PCCG AAG CCG all selected structures from the average structure for all atoms is 0.69 ( 0.21 Å. Two distance restraint violations and one dihedral angle restraint violation were greater than 0.2 Å and 2°, respectively. The average of the final energies at 300 K from the force field is -430.6 ( 5.7 kcal/mol.

Alternating Sheared AA Pairs A total of 18 of 40 modeled structures (PDB entry 2DD3) were selected for analysis of the A6/A5/A16 structure of GGU GAA GGCU . The average root-mean-square deviation of PCCG AAG CCG all selected structures from the average structure for all atoms is 0.97 ( 0.25 Å. One distance restraint violation and no dihedral angle restraint violations were greater than 0.2 Å and 2°, respectively. This minor conformation is less convergent than the other structures due to loosened restraints in the loop region. The average of the final energies at 300 K from the force field is -423.4 ( 6.3 kcal/mol. Other Known AA Geometries Are Not Consistent with the NMR Data. As illustrated in Figure 1b, several nonsheared AA pairs have been observed in crystal and NMR structures (6, 43-49). C GAA G A potential A-zipper motif, as seen in a G AAG C DNA C UAA G internal loop and the NMR structure of a G UA U RNA tetraloop receptor (50, 51), which would place A5 and A15 GGU GAA GGCU in PCCG AAG CCG stacking on each other, is ruled out because no A5H2-A15H1 or A15H2-A5H1 NOE is GGU GAA GGCU observed in PCCG AAG CCG . Both AH2 protons are exposed in the minor groove for a trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen A-A pair (Figure 1b) (6, 43). This conformation is ruled out for the middle AA pair in U GAA G because it would not give the observed cross-strand G AAG C G4H1/H2-A15H2 and G14H1/H2-A5H2 cross-peaks (Figure 3b, Table 3, and Table S2 of the Supporting Information). The cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick A-A conformation (6, 44, 45), with both AH2 protons exposed in the minor U GAA G groove, is ruled out for the middle AA in G AAG C because it would not give all the observed G14H1/H2-5H2, A6H1A15H2, A15H1-A6H2, and A16H1-A15H2 (denoted with yellow circles and ovals) and G4H1/H2-A15H2, A16H1A5H2, A5H1-A16H2, and A6H1-A5H2 (denoted with green circles and ovals) cross-peaks (Figure 3b). A trans Hoogsteen/Hoogsteen A-A pair (Figure 1b) (6, U GAA G 46-49) is ruled out for the middle AA in G AAG C because there is no indication of a syn glycosidic conformation as evidenced by A5H1-A5H8 and A15H1-A15H8 crosspeaks and because the 14H1/H2-5H2 and 4H1/H2-15H2 U GAA G cross-peaks seen in G AAG C are not expected for a trans Hoogsteen/Hoogsteen A-A pair with two AH2 protons exposed in the minor and major groove, respectively. DISCUSSION Understanding relationships among sequence, energetics, structure, dynamics, and function can facilitate rapid extraction of the information encoded in the constantly expanding databases of RNA sequences. The internal loop is a common RNA motif where such relationships are not fully understood (9, 12, 13, 52-54). A detailed understanding of interactions such as hydrogen bonding and base stacking in internal loops will allow prediction of the contributions of internal loops to RNA folding and function. U GGA G Three ConsecutiVe Sheared GA Pairs in A AAG C . The GGU GGA GGCU previous NMR structure of PCCG AAG CCG reveals three consecutive sheared GA pairs in the unusually stable internal loop (9). Formation of three consecutive sheared GA pairs U GGA G U GGA G in A AAG C (-2.27 kcal/mol) (Figures 4 and 5a), as in G AAG C (-2.62 kcal/mol), is consistent with the thermodynamic

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 22, 2006 6899 stabilities (Figure 2 and Table 2) and the occurrences of both loops in helix 41a of small subunit rRNA (52). (Throughout the paper, the values in parentheses after the duplex are the measured free energy at 37 °C for loop formation in 1 M NaCl unless otherwise noted.) In contrast to the NMR structures, helix 68 of the crystal structure of D. radiodurans large subunit rRNA contains a U GGA G loop that has only one sheared GA pair (shown in A AAG C bold) (14). The major difference is that the corresponding G5 and A15 bases are shifted, opposite to a sheared GA pair, to the minor and major groove, respectively. This results in the loss of hydrogen bonding and in a base stacking pattern equivalent to an A6/G5/A16 pattern in the minor groove, instead of the A6/A15/A16 stacking pattern found in the NMR structure (Figure 5a). Several critical NOEs define the A6/A15/A16 stacking pattern in the NMR structure with three consecutive sheared GA pairs, e.g., A15H2-A6H1, A15H1-A6H2, and A15H2-A16H1 (Figure 3a and Table S1 of the Supporting Information). The distances between the protons in each pair exceed 5 Å in the crystal structure (PDB entry 1NKW) when hydrogens are added (Table S1 of the Supporting Information). Interestingly, the A6/G5/ A16 stacking pattern in the crystal structure (Figure 5a) is similar to the A6/A5/A16 stacking pattern determined for GGU GAA GGCU the minor NMR structure of PCCG AAG CCG (Figure 5b), although fewer hydrogen bonds are formed in the crystal structure (14). There are several differences between the environments U GGA G of the A AAG C loop in the crystal and in NMR buffer. The crystals were grown from ribosomal subunits in 10 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM KCl, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.8) (14). The NMR buffer consists of 80 mM NaCl and 10 mM sodium phosphate (pD 6.8). It would be surprising, however, if Mg2+ shifted the local structure. The thermodynamics of the 3GA duplex (Figure 2) were essentially the same in 1 M NaCl and in 10 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM KCl (9). It is quite possible, however, that other interactions in the ribosomal subunit crystal are strong enough to break hydrogen bonds and rearrange stacking. There is no tertiary U GGA G interaction with or protein binding to the loop A AAG C in the G UCAAG U crystal, but the loop, C GAAGU A, which is directly 5 to the U GGA G UA closing pair of A AAG C , has tertiary interactions with helix 75 via consecutive A-minor interactions. Similar A-minor tertiary interactions are observed in the crystal structures of the large ribosomal subunits of Haloarcula marismortui and Escherichia coli between helix 75 and helix 68 (55, 56). While long-range effects may affect local structure, it may also be difficult to determine such fine details in a large crystal refined to 3.1 Å. Tandem sheared GA pairs closed by UA Watson-Crick pairs have been reported in an NMR structure of GGGCU GA AGCCU (40). The sugars of G's in U GA A are in a UCCGA AG UCGGG A AG U U GGA G C2-endo conformation. In the loop, A AAG C , of the A17 duplex, G4 and G5 have C3-endo and C2-endo sugar puckers, respectively, and G14 is populated in both conformations as evidenced by the TOCSY spectrum (Figure S1a of the Supporting Information). Evidently, a C2-endo sugar pucker for G is not required for formation of a sheared GA pair in a U G motif. AA

GGU GAA GGCU Two Alternating Structures for PCCG AAG CCG . The sheared GGU GAA GGCU AA pair in PCCG AAG CCG is rapidly exchanging between alternative conformations (Figures 5b and 6). This exchange is consistent with an intrinsically flexible AA pair with fewer hydrogen bonds than a GA pair. The pseudosymmetry of the dynamic AA pair allows an estimate of the lower limit for the exchange rate. The a5 duplex has only one conformation, and it is the same as the major conformation of the A5 duplex. The chemical shifts for a5H2 and A15H2 in this conformation are 8.44 and 7.57 ppm, respectively. With the assumption that the minor conformation of the A5 duplex would result in an A5H2 chemical shift of 7.57 ppm, the lower limit for the exchange rate is estimated to be 0.87 × 500 ) 435 s-1. A calculation based on line widths (57, 58) of H2 resonances suggests an even faster exchange rate [between 20 000 and 65 000 s-1 (Table 4)] for estimates of the major conformation ranging from 90 to 60% of the population. Fast exchange has also been detected between syn and anti G's in a single GG pair in an RNA duplex (17). A recent theoretical study has provided insight into possible mechanisms for such rapid exchange in the absence of duplex dissociation (59). GGU GAA GGCU In contrast to PCCG AAG CCG , duplexes a5, P5, I5, and I15 all have a single predominant conformation. As indicated by NOE patterns (Figure 3), there is little structural change GGU GGA GGCU for a5, P5, and I5 duplexes relative to PCCG AAG CCG (9) and to the major conformation of the A5 duplex. NMR data for the I15 duplex suggest that its structure differs from that of a5, P5, and I5 duplexes but resembles the minor structure of the A5 duplex. GGU GaA GGCU The duplex with a deoxyadenosine (a5), PCCG AAG CCG (-0.28 kcal/mol), has a single structure with a trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A15-a5 pair (Figure 1). This is consistent with the fact that G5 is predominantly in a C2endo sugar pucker conformation with a trans Hoogsteen/sugar GGU GGA GGCU edge A15-G5 pair in PCCG AAG CCG (-2.62 kcal/mol) (9). Presumably, the a5 duplex has a single structure because the deoxy sugar favors C2-endo sugar pucker which thus GGU GGA GGCU favors a single conformation similar to that of PCCG AAG CCG (9). This is also consistent with the observation that the deoxy GGU GgA GGCU g5 substitution in PCCG AAG CCG (-3.04 kcal/mol) enhances loop stability by 0.42 kcal/mol despite the loss of hydrogen bonds from G5 (2-hydroxyl) to G14 (imino/amino). The opposite change in thermodynamic stability is observed for GGU GgA GGCU (0.67 kcal/mol) compared with PCCG AAGAAA CCG GGU GGA GGCU (0.17 kcal/mol). Perhaps the greater flexPCCG AAGAAA CCG ibility of a 3 × 6 loop negates the necessity of a C2-endo sugar. Previous NMR studies showed no orientation exchange C AA G for the tandem sheared AA pairs of G AA C (7), presumably because switching the orientation would result in making the backbone too narrow for the adjacent Watson-Crick pair (60, 61). Evidently, switching the side where backbone narrowing occurs is not a problem when an AA pair is flanked by sheared GA pairs. It has been pointed out that GA might be a potential AA groove binding and/or intercalation site (43). The alternating U GAA G sheared AA pair in G AAG C could potentially serve as a switch between different binding partners for dynamic functions because the smooth N1-C2-N3 edge of either A5

Chen et al. or A15 is presented differently in the minor groove in alternative orientations (Figure 5b). Energetics of Molecular Recognition. The consistency of structures for the 3GA, I5, P5, and a5 duplexes (Figures 2 and 3) provides models for studying the interactions determining the energetics of a 3 × 3 loop with three sheared GGU GPA GGCU pairs. The P5 duplex PCCG AAG CCG (-0.53 kcal/mol) is GGU GaA thermodynamically similar to the a5 duplex PCCG AAG GGCU CCG GGU GAA GGCU (-0.28 kcal/mol) and to PCCG AAG CCG (-0.48 kcal/mol) (Table 2). This is in agreement with the formation of a sheared PA pair (trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A15-P5) without the loss of hydrogen bonds compared with a sheared AA pair (Figure 1). GGU GIA GGCU The I5 duplex PCCG AAG CCG (-1.22 kcal/mol) is 1.40 GGU GGA GGCU kcal/mol less stable than PCCG AAG CCG (-2.62 kcal/mol). Similar destabilizations of 1.74 and 2.00 kcal/mol are GGU GAA GGCU observed with the G to I substitutions in PCCG AIG CCG GGU GIA GGCU (-0.88 kcal/mol) and PCCG AAGAAA CCG (2.17 kcal/mol), respectively (Table 2). This is presumably primarily due to the loss of hydrogen bonds of G5 amino to A15N7 and to the A15 nonbridging oxygen in the IA pair compared to GA (Figure 1). The free energy of 1.5 kcal/mol attributed to two hydrogen bonds is a lower limit because subtle rearrangement of three-dimensional structure is expected upon inosine substitution, and this can strengthen the remaining hydrogen bonds (62). GGU GIA GGCU Interestingly, PCCG AAG CCG (-1.22 kcal/mol) is more GGU GPA GGCU GGU GAA GGCU stable than PCCG AAG CCG (-0.53 kcal/mol), PCCG AAG CCG GGU GaA GGCU (-0.48 kcal/mol), and PCCG AAG CCG (-0.28 kcal/mol) (Table 2 and Figure 2), even though the number of basebase hydrogen bonds is expected to be the same (Figure 1). A water-mediated hydrogen bond between the G imino proton and the nonbridging oxygen of A was predicted (15) and observed in a crystal structure of a GNRA tetraloop (63). A similar water-mediated hydrogen bond might exist between I5H1 and an A15 nonbridging oxygen in the I5 duplex GGU GIA GGCU . This water-mediated hydrogen bond might PCCG AAG CCG explain the extra stability of the I5 duplex relative to those of the P5, A5, and a5 duplexes (Figure 2). GGU GDA GGCU The D5 (2,6-diaminopurine) duplex, PCCG AAG CCG (-1.45 GGU GGA GGCU kcal/mol), is 1.2 kcal/mol less stable than PCCG AAG CCG (-2.62 kcal/mol) (Table 2 and Figure 2), even though no base-base hydrogen bonds are lost (Figure 1). The destabilizing effect upon substitution of D5 for G5 may also be due to loss of the proposed water-mediated hydrogen bond between G5H1 and an A15 nonbridging oxygen (15, 63). It is also possible that the 2-amino group of G is a better hydrogen bond donor than that of D (2,6-diaminopurine) because of relatively larger positive partial charges on the G amino hydrogens (64). Greater destabilization of 2.3 kcal/ GGU GDA GGCU mol is observed for PCCG AAGAAA CCG (2.47 kcal/mol) comGGU GGA GGCU pared with PCCG AAGAAA CCG (0.17 kcal/mol). Perhaps the greater flexibility of the size-asymmetric loop allows binding of a water molecule in a GA pair to be more favorable. In GGU GGA GGCU contrast, substitution of D for A16 to give PCCG DAG CCG GGU GAA GGCU (-3.32 kcal/mol) and PCCG DAG CCG (-0.78 kcal/mol) stabilizes the loop by -0.70 and -0.30 kcal/mol, respectively, even though the 6-amino group on D (2,6-diaminopurine) has essentially the same partial charges as A (64). The extra

Alternating Sheared AA Pairs amino group on D possibly allows better stacking and/or extra hydrogen bonding to the backbone. A 2-O-methyl substitution favors the C3-endo sugar conformation (65-67). The 2-O-methyl A15 substitution GGU GGA GGCU GGU GAA GGCU in PCCG AMG CCG (-3.83 kcal/mol) and PCCG AMG CCG (-0.83 kcal/mol) stabilizes the duplexes by -1.21 and -0.35 kcal/ GGU GGA GGCU mol relative to PCCG AAG CCG (-2.62 kcal/mol) and GGU GAA GGCU (-0.48 kcal/mol), respectively (Table 2). PCCG AAG CCG U GAA G Part of the reason for the smaller effect in the G AAG C loop may be that the 2-O-methyl substitution limits the loop to a single conformation. If the two conformations of the natural loop have equal concentrations, then the dynamics would favor loop formation [G°37 ) -TS ) -310(1.987) ln 2 ) -0.4 kcal/mol]. GA Motif within Other Internal Loops. Adjacent sheared AA C GAC C C GAC G GA and AA pairs are also found in the G AAC G and G AAC C loops in helix 89 of the large ribosomal subunits of H. marismortui (45) and E. coli (56), respectively. In this case, the bold A pairs with its Hoogsteen edge and the CC pair is in a cis Watson-Crick bifurcated conformation (45, 56) according to Leontis-Westhof nomenclature (6). The same loop sequence occurs in helix 41a of E. coli 16S rRNA with a similar three-dimensional conformation (56). Other GA motifs have nonsheared pairs. Only face-to-face AA (cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick pair) purine-purine pairs G GAA C (Figure 1) form in the loop U AAG G in helix 23 of the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus 16S rRNA (44), which is consistent with previous NMR studies which showed that imino GA (face-to-face, cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick C A-G pair) is favored in the G GA G motif (68). The crystal C AG C structure of a symmetric 4 × 4 loop, G GAAA G, shows little AAAG C GA base overlap for the AA nearest neighbors with sheared GA (trans Hoogsteen/sugar edge A-G) pairs and trans WatsonCrick/Hoogsteen A-A pairs (43). [In the trans Watson-Crick/ Hoogsteen A-A pairs, the A paired with Hoogsteen edge is bold (Figure 1).] Evidently, GA is an intrinsically flexible AA structure within size-symmetric internal loops. C GAAA G The free energy increment for G AAAG C at 37 °C in 1 M NaCl is 0.96 kcal/mol as calculated from the measurement CGC GAAA GGC of the duplex GCG AAAG CCG (13). In contrast, internal loops U GGAA G with consecutive GA pairs are very stable, e.g., G AAGG C (-4.27 kcal/mol) (13), which is consistent with extensive stacking and hydrogen bonding as observed in the crystal C structure of the loop G GGAA G with four sheared GA pairs AAGG C (69). Previous thermodynamic studies showed that the C destabilizing 2 × 2 loop G AA G (1.2 kcal/mol) with two AA C sheared AA pairs has base pairing and stacking geometries C similar to those of but fewer hydrogen bonds than G GA G AG C (-0.7 kcal/mol) with two sheared GA pairs (2, 5, 7, 8). Evidently, the thermodynamic and structural effects of replacing a GA pair with an AA pair are context-dependent. A recently proposed "reverse kink-turn" motif involves a G GA size-asymmetric 2 × 5 internal loop, C AAACA G, with a C sheared GA followed by a symmetric AA pair (trans Hoogsteen/Hoogsteen A-A pair) (Figure 1b) (49). Such a conformation is also observed in some loop E motifs, GA GUA (45, 47, 48). The glycosidic bond of the A (in bold) AA AR 3 to the G of the sheared GA pair is in a syn conformation. Thus, it might facilitate the packing between two stems via

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 22, 2006 6901 major grooves, with the smooth N1-C2-N3 edge of the bold A flipped to the major groove. Different detailed structures of an AA pair adjacent to a sheared GA pair in GA nearest AA neighbors with the bold A paired on its Hoogsteen side are also observed in kink-turn motifs (70) within internal loops, such as kt-11 (trans Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen A-A pair), and multibranch loops such as kt 94/99 (trans Hoogsteen/ Sugar edge A-A pair), kt 4/5 (trans Hoogsteen/Hoogsteen A-A, with the A in a syn glycosidic conformation). These kink turns facilitate local and long-range tertiary interactions (70). In these cases, the A 3 to the G of a sheared GA pair prefers to base pair with its Hoogsteen edge. Evidently, the GA nearest neighbor is intrinsically flexible compared with AA the motif of consecutive GA pairs (13) in both sizesymmetric and -asymmetric internal loops.
