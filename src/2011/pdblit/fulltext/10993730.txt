SUMMARY: Incubation of penicillin acylase from Escherichia coli with phenylglyoxal or 2,3-butanedione results in enzyme inactivation. Both benzylpenicillin and phenylacetate protect the enzyme against the inactivation, indicating the presence of arginine at or near the catalytic site. The reactions follow pseudofirst order kinetics and the inactivation kinetics indicate the presence of a single essential arginine moiety. ©1990AcademicPress, Inc.

MATERIALS

AND

METHODS

Phenylglyoxal and 2,3-butanedione were obtained from Fluka, benzylpenicillin and 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) were gifts from Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd., phenylacetic acid was o b t a i n e d from Aldrich, and DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B was f r o m Pharmacia. Escherichia coli NCIM 2 3 5 0 w a s o b t a i n e d from the National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms, Pune, and was m a i n tained routinely on n u t r i e n t agar slants.

Penicillin acylase. The enzyme was isolated from the extract of cells of E. coli grown at 26°C for 24 h under shake flask conditions in a medium of the following composition: yeast extract, 2 g; bactopeptone, 2 g; tryptone, 1 g; beef extract, 2 g; corn steep liquor (0.5 g/ml), 25 ml; K2HPO 4, 3 g; KH2PO., 0 . 3 g; NaC1, 3 . 5 g; (NHa)TSO a, 1 g; M g S O a . 7 H ~ O , - 0 . 2 g; pheny~acetic acid, 1 g; and wat6r-to-make to 1 L-after adjustm e n t o f pH t o 7 . 2 . Cells were harvested by c e n t r i f u g a t i o n , washed with 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 . 5 and stored at -20°C. Cells (60 g wet weight) were thawed, suspended in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, (3 ml/g packed cells), cooled in an ice bath and disrupted by sonication (20 Kc,300 W) for a total period of i0 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and all subsequent operations were carried out at 0-4°C.
The clear cell-free extract was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionationj and the fraction obtained between 0.3 0.8 saturation was c o l l e c t e d , dissolved in the minimum volume of 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 . 5 , and dialyzed overnight against I00 volumes of buffer of the same composition. The dialysate was c l a r i f i e d by c e n t r i f u g a t i o n and applied on t o a DEAE-Sepharose C L - 6 B c o l u m n (3 x 75 cm) p r e v i o u s l y equilibrated with 0.0i M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 . 5 . The e n z y m e was e l u t e d using a linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 . 5 (0.01 - 0 . I M). The eluant with enzyme activity was c o n c e n t r a t e d by u l t r a f i l t r a t i o n and loaded on a Sephadex G-200 column equilibrated with 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 . 5 ; the fractions with penicillin acylase activity were pooled and concentrated by u l t r a f i l t r a t i o n .

Enzym e assay. Penicillin acylase activity was assayed essentially as described by Balasingham et al. (10) by measuring the amount of 6-APA produced at 40°C using 4% b e n z y l p e n i cillin as substrate in 0.I M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 . 8 and 6-APA produced was measured with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde according to the procedure of Bomstein and Evans (II). One u n i t (U) o f e n z y m e a c t i v i t y is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis o f i Dmol o f s u b s t r a t e in I min under the assay conditions.

Treatment with arginine modifyi~ reagents. Penicillin acylase was incubated at 25°C with either phenylglyoxal (2.5-20 mM)in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0! or 2,3-butaneaione (I0 - 40 mM) in 0.05 M sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0. The reaction system was shielded from light when 2,3-butanedione was used as the arginine modifying reagent (14). Enzyme incubated with buffers in absence of the modifying reagents served as controls. Aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals for assay of enzymatic activity. Protection of the enzyme against inactivation arginine reagents was tested with benzylpenicillin-K phenylacetate. The compounds were tested at 50 mM centration and pH 8.0 and were added immediately addition of phenylglyoxal (20 mM final concentration) butanedione (40 mM~ final concentration. by salt final before or the and conthe 2,3-
