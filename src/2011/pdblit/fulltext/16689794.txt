Summary BldD is a central regulator of the developmental process in Streptomyces coelicolor. The 1.8 Å resolution structure of the DNA-binding domain of BldD (BldDN) reveals that BldDN forms a compact globular domain composed of four helices (a1­a4) containing a helixturn-helix motif (a2­a3) resembling that of the DNAbinding domain of lambda repressor. The BldDN/DNA complex model led us to design a series of mutants, which revealed the important role of a3 and the `turn' region between a2 and a3 for DNA recognition. Based on the fact that BldD occupies two operator sites of bldN and whiG and shows significant disparity in the affinity toward the two operator sites when they are disconnected, we propose a model of cooperative binding, which means that the binding of one BldD dimer to the high affinity site facilitates that of the second BldD dimer to the low affinity site. In addition, structural and mutational investigation reveals that the Tyr62Cys mutation, found in the first-identified bldD mutant, can destabilize BldD structure by disrupting the hydrophobic core. Introduction Streptomycetes, filamentous soil bacteria, are industrially important because they produce many beneficial metabolites such as antibiotics, antiparasitic agents, herbicides and pharmacologically active metabolites (e.g. immunosuppressants) (Hodgson, 2000). In addition, their morphoAccepted 24 March, 2006. For correspondence. *E-mail chajung@postech.ac.kr; Tel. (+82) 54 279 1563; Fax (+82) 54 279 1599. E-mail kangsaou@snu.ac.kr; Tel.

logical differentiation, which involves complex regulation of gene expression, makes them unique among bacteria. The developmental process begins with the formation of multigenomic aerial mycelia that grow out into the air, constituting a fuzzy layer on the colony surface, and finally unigenomic spores are generated through the multiple septation of aerial hyphae (Chater, 1993, 1998; Kelemen and Buttner, 1998). Two main classes of genes, whi and bld genes, that are requisite for the morphological development have been identified in Streptomyces coelicolor, which is the most studied member of the genus (Chater, 1972, 1998). The whi genes, whose mutations yield `white' aerial mycelium due to the lack of the grey spore pigment, are essential for the spore maturation in aerial hyphae (Chater, 1972). Mutations in the bld genes cause the loss of aerial hyphae and have a shiny, `bald' phenotype (Merrick, 1976; Willey et al., 1993; Nodwell et al., 1996). Moreover, the bld mutants show pleiotropic effects, including defects in carbon catabolite repression and in cell­cell signalling, and sometimes inhibition of antibiotic production (Merrick, 1976; Champness, 1988; Willey et al., 1993; Pope et al., 1996; Kelemen and Buttner, 1998; Nodwell et al., 1999). So far, many bld mutants, including bldA, bldB, bldC, bldD, bldF, bldG, bldH, bldI, bldK and bldM, have been identified. These mutants are known to be unable to produce a small hydrophobic molecule, SapB (Sporeassociated protein) that contributes to aerial hyphae formation by reducing the surface tension at the colony surface (Willey et al., 1991; Tillotson et al., 1998). Interestingly, when certain pairs of bld mutants are grown on rich media in close proximity, one mutant can trigger aerial hyphae formation of the other mutant (Willey et al., 1991; Willey et al., 1993; Tillotson et al., 1998; Nodwell et al., 1999; Molle and Buttner, 2000). This so-called extracellular complementation is always unidirectional, and can be explained by assuming the hierarchical cascade of intercellular signals for aerial hyphae formation: [bldJ] < [bldK - bldL] < [bldA - bldH] < [bldG] < [bldC] < [bldM - bldD]. That is, one mutant that is higher in the hierarchy and acts as a donor can give signals to the other mutant acting as a recipient through unidentified signalling mechanism, and thus render the recipient mutant to

The bldD mutant stands on top of the complementation hierarchy and is able to complement extracellularly all of the known bld mutants except for itself and the bldM mutant that takes the same position in the hierarchy as the bldD mutant (Willey et al., 1993; Nodwell et al., 1996). Streptomyces coelicolor ram gene cluster (ramA, ramB, ramC, ramR and ramS) has also been revealed to be required for the erection of aerial hyphae (Ma and Kendall, 1994). These genes accelerated the formation of aerial hyphae when introduced into Streptomyces lividans (Ma and Kendall, 1994), and ramC-, ramS- and ramR-deleted mutants exhibited a severe defect in aerial hyphae formation (O'Connor et al., 2002). Recently, Kodani et al. (2004) demonstrated that SapB is a lantibiotic-like peptide derived from RamS, strongly suggesting that the expression of ram gene cluster is under the control of the bld gene-dependent extracellular cascades. Consistently, the ram genes were not transcribed in the bld mutants (bldA, bldB, bldH and bldD) (Keijser et al., 2002). Considering the extracellular complementation hierarchy, therefore, it can be assumed that the bldD gene exists at the highest position in bld and ram gene-mediated signalling cascades and roles as a central regulator of aerial hyphae formation in S. coelicolor. The bldD gene product, BldD, consists of 167 amino acids and exists mainly as a dimer in solution (Elliot et al., 2003). The first-identified bldD mutant has a point mutation at position 62 from Tyr to Cys (Elliot et al., 1998). Elliot et al. (2003) reported that constructed bldD null mutant showed the same phenotype as the bldD point mutant, indicating that the point mutation (Y62C) completely abolished the function of BldD. Analysis of the BldD sequence using PFAM search (Bateman et al., 1999; Kelemen et al., 2001) revealed that BldD contains an XRE (Xenobiotic Response Element) type of helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif at its N-terminus. This family of transcription factors includes lambda repressor (Maniatis and Ptashne, 1973; Maniatis et al., 1975) and Bacillus subtilis sporulation repressor SinR (Gaur et al., 1986), which operate at crucial checkpoints where the biological fate is determined. For example, the lambda repressor cooperatively binds to the lytic promoter and prevents the expression of genes required for lytic growth (Meyer et al., 1980). BldD also operates as a repressor at developmental checkpoint and binds to several target sites with imperfect inverted repeat (Elliot et al., 2001). In fact, BldD binds to its own promoter (Elliot and Leskiw, 1999; Elliot et al., 2001) and regulatory regions of several developmental key genes such as bldN encoding a sigma factor required for the formation of aerial hyphae and the transcription of bldM (Bibb et al., 2000), and whiG which encodes a sigma factor that plays a critical role in sporulation (Chater et al., 1989). In addition, BldD binds to the promoters of sigH encoding the sigma factor associated with stress responses (Kelemen et al., 2001) and bdtA (= BldD target) whose function is still uncharacterized (Elliot et al., 2001). As an effort to gain a better elucidation of BldD function, we have determined the three dimensional structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of BldD (BldDN) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) at 1.8 Å resolution. This structure will provide an important framework for understanding how BldD recognizes multiple promoter sites and thus regulates their transcription as well as how the point mutation at position 62 eliminates the whole function of BldD.

Results and discussion Overview of BldDN monomer structure Out of the total 79 amino acids in native BldDN, residues 2­71 are visible in the crystal structure. BldDN adopts a compact globular structure composed of four helices (Fig. 1A), which is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions among helices: Leu13 from 1 (residues 3­20), Val27 from 2 (residues 24­32), Trp35 from the turn between 2 and 3 (turn23), Val40 from 3 (residues 37­45), Leu58, Phe61 and Tyr62 from 4 (residues 51­62) form a hydrophobic core (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal loop (residues 65­71) takes part in the dimeric packing interactions in crystals (see Dimerization of BldDN) (Fig. 1A). Of the four helices, 2 and 3 constitute a classical HTH DNAbinding motif, and 1 appears to form a structural scaffold that anchors 2 and 3 (Fig. 1A) (Harrison and Aggarwal, 1990). In this classical motif, the latter helix, often called a `recognition helix', typically makes specific contacts with bases in the major groove of DNA. In BldDN, similarly, 3 roles as the recognition helix (see BldDN/DNA complex model). Structural homologue search using the program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1997) identified several homologues of BldDN, ascertaining that the three dimensional structure of BldDN is closely related to the XRE family of transcription factors. The highest homologue was the DNA-binding domain of lambda repressor (lambdaN) (Z-score of 9.3 and r.m.s.d. of 2.2 Å). The lambdaN (residues 1­93) contains five  helices. Consistent with BldDN, the first four helices form a compact globular domain containing a classical HTH motif with 3 as a recognition helix (Jordan and Pabo, 1988). Despite limited sequence identity between BldDN and lambdaN (25%) (Fig. 2A), the structure of BldDN is well-superimposed onto that of lambdaN except for the additional helix (5) of lambdaN (Fig. 2B), proposing that BldD and lambda repressor could be related in their DNA-binding mode.

respect to the twofold crystallographic symmetry in crystals. However, these dimeric contacts of BldDN are not extensive (only 14.7% of surface is buried on dimerization), and the arrangement of the two HTH motifs of BldDN dimer observed in crystals is not effective to bind DNA. When two BldDN monomers were superimposed onto lambdaN/operator complex structure, the dimer interface of BldDN was disrupted (Fig. 4B). In addition, the dissociation constant (KD) of BldDN is 2.2-fold higher than wildtype BldD, indicating that the C-terminal domain contributes to the effective DNA binding of BldD (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the dimeric contacts of BldDN observed in crystals appear not to reflect the dimeric interactions of intact BldD, and instead the C-terminal domain of BldD, like lambda repressor, might mainly contribute to the dimerization of BldD. In lambda repressor, although stable lambdaN/DNA complex structure was reported (Beamer and Pabo, 1992), the C-terminal domain (residues 132­ 236) primarily mediates the dimerization of full-length lambda repressor (Bell and Lewis, 2001). BldDN/DNA complex model Structural similarity between BldDN and lambdaN led us to hypothesize that BldDN would be similar to lamdaN in terms of the DNA-binding mode. To get insights into the BldD­DNA interactions, we built a model of a DNA-bound BldDN by superimposing BldDN onto the lambdaN/DNA complex structure (Fig. 4B). According to this model which shows good geometric and electrostatic complementarity between BldDN and DNA, 3 fits snugly into the major groove and makes direct interactions with DNA: the mainly basic and hydrophobic residues including Lys36 from turn23, and Val38, Ser42, Tyr43 and Arg45 from 3, contact directly DNA through hydrophobic or polar interactions (Fig. 4B and D). Supporting this model, the surface representation shows that hydrophobic and positivecharged residues are located along and around 3 (Fig. 4C), indicating that these region possibly contacts bases and phosphate backbone. Mutational analysis of the ability of full-length BldD to bind DNA based on the BldDN/DNA complex model In the BldDN/DNA model, the recognition helix, 3, most extensively contacts the major groove of DNA (Fig. 4B). To further explore DNA recognition by BldD, We mutated five residues of 3, Val38, Val40, Ser42, Tyr43 and Arg45, to alanine, and tested the ability of single-site full-length BldD mutant to bind to four BldD-binding sites by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5A, substitution of Tyr43 and Arg45, both of which are predicted to interact with DNA from the BldDN/DNA complex model, with alanine resulted in

Dimerization of BldDN In general, transcription factors act as a dimer or tetramer, and BldD also binds to its own promoter as a dimer (Elliot et al., 2003). The fact that BldDN retains its DNA-binding ability (Fig. 3A) and exists as a dimer in solution (Fig. 3B) arouses an interest in the dimerization of BldDN, and we can find weak dimeric contacts of BldDN in crystal packing. The C-terminal loop of BldDN of one subunit slightly extends out from the globular domain to form a dimer interface with that of the other subunit: the side chain of Leu70 of one subunit interacts with Val66 of the other, and similarly Val66 makes hydrophobic contacts with Leu70 (Fig. 4A). These two subunits are arranged with

almost complete loss of DNA-binding activity. In contrast, S42A mutant exhibits a selective defect against four operator sites. In lambda repressor, Ser45 in the recognition helix, corresponding to Ser42 of BldD, directly contacts DNA by polar interaction, and S45A mutant failed to discriminate between base-pair changes at specific location of the operator site (Hochschild and Ptashne, 1986; Beamer and Pabo, 1992). Furthermore, Ser45 contacts the asymmetric operator site (consensus and nonconsensus half) with two distinct conformations, suggesting an important role of Ser45 in the specific recognition of the asymmetric operator sites by lambda repressor. The seven known BldD-binding sites (Elliot et al., 2001; Kelemen et al., 2001) also consist of incomplete inverted repeat with relatively low sequence conservation. That is, BldD dimer would bind asymmetrically to them and 3 of BldD is much likely to contribute to the discrimination and specific recognition of these variable sequences. The selective binding observed in S42A mutant indicates that this mutant protein has a defect in recognizing the sequence variation. Therefore, Ser42 can be assumed to be related to the specific recognition of multiple operator sites with incomplete inverted repeat by BldD. Complete loss of DNA-binding activity was also observed in V40A mutant. Because Val40 appears to be simply involved in the hydrophobic core formation (Fig. 1B), it can be deduced that the correct hydrophobic core formation of BldD contributes to the protein function

possibly by providing a stable scaffold for DNA binding. The importance of the hydrophobic core will be additionally discussed (see Mutational analysis of Tyr62 residue). Possible role of turn23 in DNA binding In BldDN/DNA complex model, Lys36 of turn23 directly contacts the phosphate backbone of DNA (Fig. 4D). In addition, interestingly, large and positively charged residues such as Arg34, Trp35 and Lys36 are located at this turn23. To speculate the role of turn23, Arg34, Trp35 and Lys36 were mutated to alanine. The K36A mutant showed severe defect in its DNA-binding activity, as expected in the BldDN/DNA model (Fig. 5B). Selective and significant defects in DNA binding were observed in R34A, W35A and R34A/W35A mutants (Fig. 5B). These residues make extensive contacts with each other and residues mainly from 4: the bulky side chain of Trp35 stacks with the side chain of Arg34 in turn23, and makes hydrophobic contacts with Arg54, Leu58 and Phe61 from 4 (Fig. 4E). These contacts appear to be of importance in maintaining proper conformation of turn23 for DNA binding. Therefore, substitution of Arg34 and Trp35 with alanine would affect the structure of turn23 interfering with the recognition of DNA. The two helices of the prokaryotic HTH motif are generally connected by a short turn of three amino acids that starts from mainly glycine residue (Brennan and Matthews, 1989; Wintjens and Rooman, 1996).

repressor follows this rule faithfully. However, interestingly, the `turn' connecting 2 and 3 of BldDN is composed of four residues although it starts from glycine (Fig. 2). This is of particular interest because BldD binds to multiple operator sites containing an asymmetric inverted repeat with limited sequence conservation, that is, various conformations would be required for BldD dimer to specifically recognize them. Considering that the `turn' region is involved in maintaining relative orientation and distance between 2 and 3 for the stable protein­DNA complex, a longer `turn' could allow additional flexibility for BldD to

recognize and regulate more target genes than the lambda repressor. In addition, the selective defects observed in R34A, W35A and R34A/W35A mutants suggest that turn23 of BldD also contributes to the specific recognition of multiple operator sites like Ser42. Construction of a bldD null mutant and in vivo complementation experiments In order to investigate the role of 3 and turn23 in vivo, we constructed a bldD null mutant (Fig. 6A­C) (see

Experimental procedures) and tested whether BldD point mutants used in this study could complement aerial mycelium formation of the bldD mutant. For this purpose, we introduced pSET162 (see Experimental procedures) derivatives containing wild-type bldD and bldD with point mutations into the bldD null mutant. As shown in Fig. 6D and E, K36A, V40A, Y43A and R45A mutants, which exhibited almost complete loss of DNA-binding activity in EMSA experiment, failed to complement the bld phenotype. W35A, R34A/W35A and S42A mutants, which selectively bound to BldD-target promoters in vitro, showed slightly retarded the formation of aerial mycelia compared with wild-type BldD (Fig. 6D and E). It is likely that the ability of these mutants to bind to BldDtarget promoters, despite its selectivity and low affinity, still can make the development proceed. Why R34A showed most severe defect compared with W35A, R34A/W35A and S42A (Fig. 6E) is unclear. However, these results together with the EMSA data suggest that Ser42 and turn23 are involved in the recognition of multiple promoters with low sequence conservation. Cooperative binding of BldD Elliot et al. (2001) demonstrated BldD binds to two oper-

ator sites in each promoter region of bldN (pbldNI and pbldNII) and whiG (pwhiGI and pwhiGII) respectively. As the quantity of BldD was increased, three differently retarded bands showed rapid transition into the most retarded species. Furthermore, it was reported that BldD exists as a mixture of dimers and tetramers in solution with the ratio of 7:2, indicating that BldD could form a tetramer in certain environments (Elliot et al., 2003). These results, together with the fact that the structure of BldDN is highly homologous to that of lamdaN whose repression activity is achieved by the cooperative binding, suggest the cooperativity between BldD proteins on DNA binding. To test this hypothesis, the DNA-binding activity of fulllength BldD against the operator sites of bldN and whiG were investigated. Because BldD binds to the promoter region of bldD as a dimer (Elliot et al., 2003) and all the DNA probes used in our EMSA experiments have similar lengths about 30 bp containing one inverted repeat (see Experimental procedures), we can safely assume that the retarded bands in Fig. 7 are a BldD2­DNA complex. Interestingly, BldD binds to the pbldNI (from -29 to -2) with high affinity and exhibits nearly negligible affinity to the pbldNII (from + 33 to + 59) (Fig. 7A). Similarly, BldD exhibits DNA-binding affinity only to the pwhiGII, not to pwhiGI

(from -25 to + 2) (Fig. 7B). The selective DNA-binding activity of BldD toward separated operator sites and the fact that BldD binds to two operator sites, when they are connected, indicate that the binding of one BldD dimer to pbldNI site could cooperatively facilitate the binding of the second BldD dimer to pbldNII. The two operator sites of bldN and whiG are separated by 9.8 turn (103 bp) and 5.8 turn (61 bp), respectively, as assuming 10.5 bp per turn. One possible model for the cooperative binding to two operator sites far away from each other is the binding of BldD dimers through DNA bending like lambda repressor. When lambda repressor and DNA were incubated under the conditions for cooperative binding, repressors at the separated sites touch each other and the DNA bends smoothly in order to accommodate the protein­protein interaction (Griffith et al., 1986; Hochschild and Ptashne, 1986). Mutational analysis of Tyr62 residue BldD mutant allele was first identified as an A(r)G point mutation changing a tyrosine residue at position 62 to a cysteine (Y62C) (Elliot et al., 1998). Elliot et al. (2003) reported that the Y62C point mutation has the same effect as the whole deletion of bldD gene, implying that Tyr62 plays a critical role in either the function or the stability of the protein. In order to verify the role of Tyr62 in BldD, Tyr62 was substituted with Cys, Ser and Phe respectively. As shown in Fig. 8B, Y62F mutant remained soluble, whereas two mutants Y62C and Y62S exhibits highly reduced solubility

(almost all proteins went into the insoluble fraction). This result can be explained by the role of Tyr62 in stabilizing the BldDN structure. The side chain of Tyr62 aims toward the centre of the globular domain of BldDN and is thus extensively implicated in the formation of a hydrophobic core together with Leu13, Val27, Trp35, Val40, Leu58 and Phe61 (Fig. 1B). In addition, Tyr62 forms a T-shaped aromatic­aromatic interaction with the adjacent Phe61 stabilizing the C-terminus end of 4 by helix capping (Burley and Petsko, 1985) (Figs 1B and 8A). Therefore, substitution of Tyr62 with small residues such as Cys and Ser would disrupt the hydrophobic core and destabilize 4. Consistently Y62F mutant was able to complement the bldD null mutant, while Y62C and Y62S mutants failed (Fig. 8C). Several lines of evidences have suggested that aromatic residues contribute to the stability of proteins when they occupy the interior of proteins for hydrophobic interactions (Serrano et al., 1991; Sekharudu et al., 1992; Anderson et al., 1993; Nam et al., 2001). For example, mutation of Tyr55, in the active-site cavity of ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) from Pseudomonas putida, to Ser resulted in a decrease of stability by about 9.5 kcal mol-1 and disrupted the helical structure of Tyr55containing helix, suggesting that the aromatic side chain of the tyrosine residue contributes to conformational stability of KSI (Nam et al., 2001). In fact, Y62F mutant retains its solubility (Fig. 8B), indicating that the aromatic­aromatic interaction between Phe62 and Phe61 still stabilizes 4 and hydrophobic core. As a conclusion, because the Y62C mutation disrupts the

hydrophobic core, the Y62C mutant is destabilized and thus loses its function. Feasible mechanism for the regulation of BldD activity Upon the initiation of aerial hyphae formation in S. coelicolor, the transcription of bldN that is essential for the erection of aerial hyphae is significantly derepressed (Elliot et al., 2001). This result suggests that the repressor activity of BldD against bldN should be overcome for aerial hyphae formation. Elliot et al. (1998) proposed a phosphorylation at Tyr62 for this derepression mechanism, because the only known bldD mutant allele except for the bldD-deleted mutant has an Y62C point mutation. However, our structure clearly reveals that Tyr62 is placed inside of BldDN (solvent accessible surface area for the OH of Tyr62 is 0 Å2), and thus is crucial for the hydrophobic core formation (Figs 1B and 8A). Therefore, it is unlikely that the regulation of BldD activity is mediated by phosphorylation at Tyr62. The fact that BldDN structure is closely related to the XRE-family of transcription factors provides us two feasible derepression mechanisms. First, BldD activity could be regulated by proteolytic cleavage like lambda repres-

sor. In lambda repressor, the repressor activity is regulated by Escherichia coli RecA-mediated self-cleavage between N- and C-terminal domains (Roberts and Roberts, 1975; Kim and Little, 1993). However, because BldD has no self-cleavage site, it could be cleaved or degraded by a certain stage-specific protease. Second, the derepression could be achieved by BldD-sequestering like SinR. SinI blocks the repressor activity of SinR by sequestering the SinR as a heterodimer (Bai et al., 1993; Lewis et al., 1998). Further analysis about whether BldD is cleaved or sequestered and, if it is, which protein is involved in this process is a great challenge in the future. In summary, we determined the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of BldD, and could identify putative residues required for DNA recognition from the structural, mutational and in vivo complementational analyses: Lys36, Tyr43 and Arg45 play a critical role in DNA binding, and Arg34, Trp35 and Ser42 appear to be involved in the specific recognition of multiple promoters. The molecular basis for the loss of protein activity of the Y62C mutant was also suggested based on the role of Tyr62 for the hydrophobic core formation. In addition, our biochemical assay supports the possibility of cooperative binding of BldD to its target sites. Our future studies will be focused

Crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of BldD 1189 on the verification of the mechanism for relief from the repressor activity of BldD and the identification of proteins involved in this process. Experimental procedures Bacterial strains and growth conditions
For overexpression and selenomethionine-labelling, E. coli strain BL21 (ED3) and B834 (DE3) (Novagen) were used respectively. E. coli BW25113 (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000) was used to propagate the recombination plasmid pIJ790 and S. coelicolor cosmids. E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 (Paget et al., 1999) was the non-methylating plasmid donor strain during conjugal gene transfer from E. coli to Streptomyces. E. coli strains were grown in Luria­Bertani medium at 37°C, and S. coelicolor A3(2) was cultured on R2YE and MS agar (Kieser et al., 2000) at 30°C. Ampicillin (Sigma) and thiostrepton (Sigma) were used at 100 and 30 µg ml-1, and kanamycin (Sigma) and apramycin (Sigma) were used at 50 µg ml-1. of BldDN-Q20M mutant, methionine auxotroph E. coli B834 (DE3) (Novagen) strain was used as a host for plasmid transformation. The selenomethionyl BldDN-Q20M mutant protein was purified by an identical procedure to that for the wild-type BldDN. The purified SeMet BldDN-Q20M was concentrated to approximately 10 mg ml-1 for crystallization. Native BldDN crystals (C2; a = 77.2, b = 31.8 and c = 33.6 Å,  = 105.1°, a monomer in asymmetric unit) were grown and a 1.8 Å data set was obtained with a Macscience 2030b imaging plate at Beamline 6B at Pohang Light Source as described previously (Kim et al., 2004). The selenomethionyl BldDN-Q20M crystals were grown as described previously (Kim et al., 2004). These crystals belonged to space group P21 with cell parameters a = 33.7, b = 70.5 and c = 38.8 Å,  = 112.3°, and contained two monomers per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were processed and scaled with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL program suite (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The structure was solved by the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using three wavelength data sets of the selenomethionyl Q20M mutant crystal: the peak wavelength was at 0.97932 Å, and the inflection wavelength was at 0.97942 Å, and the remote wavelength was at 0.98722 Å. Three selenium sites were located, and phase refinement was carried out by using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 1999; Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). Initial phasing and model building was performed with Q20M MAD data set. Model building was performed using the program QUANTA software (Molecular Simulations) and refined with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) to an Rfree of 0.268 and Rwork of 0.252 in the resolution range of 20­2.3 Å. The native BldDN structure was solved by molecular replacement with CNS using the Q20M structure as a search model, and refined to Rfree of 0.225 and Rwork of 0.188 in the resolution range of 20­ 1.8 Å. The refinement statistics for the native BldDN structure are summarized in Table 1. The ideality of the model stere-

Protein purification, crystallization and structure determination
BldDN from S. coelicolor A3(2) was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (Kim et al., 2004). Because BldDN contains no methionine residue except for the Nterminal methionine, one glutamine residue (Gln20) was mutated to methionine (Q20M) (Kim et al., 2004) to ensure an anomalous signal in the X-ray diffraction experiment. Gln20 residue was selected on the basis of a secondary structure prediction using Jpred server (Cuff et al., 1998), which suggested that this residue might be located at the terminus of -helix region.

Determination of oligomeric state of BldDN
Purified recombinant BldDN and low molecular mass standards (Amersham Biosciences) were applied on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl. A standard curve was generated by plotting the logarithm of molecular mass of standard proteins against their Kav, where Kav = (Ve ­Vo)/(Vt ­ Vo): Ve, elution volume; Vo, void volume; Vt, total bed volume. Kav of BldDN determined by using the same column was compared with the profile of protein standards: bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa).

These oligonucleotides were annealed in an annealing buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM NaCl. The annealing mixture was heated to 100°C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to 30°C. These annealed oligonucleotides were end-labelled by Klenow fragment with dig-dUTP (Roche) for 1 h and used for EMSA experiments. EMSA were performed using the dig-labelled probes. BldD and BldD mutants were incubated with dig-labelled probes at 30°C for 20 min in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 µg of poly dIdC, and 10% glycerol. The DNA­protein complexes were run out on 10% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to Nylon membrane and colour development was performed with addition of nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate following the manufacturer's instructions.

Site-directed mutagenesis of BldD
For site-directed mutagenesis of the full-length BldD proteins, the gene encoding the full-length BldD was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using S. coelicolor A3(2) genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted downstream of the T7 promoter of the pET-15b (Novagen) generating pET-15bBldD. The Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used with a template of pET-15b-BldD and proper primer pairs for each mutation. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the purified plasmids.

Determination of the dissociation constant (KD) of BldD and BldDN
Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments using DIG-labelled pbldD with 0.15­1.5 µM of BldD or 0.3­3.0 µM of BldDN were performed and the developed bands were quantified by using LAS-3000 (FUJIFILM) and Multi Gauge V3.0 software. Band intensities for the DNA­protein complexes were reported as percentage of total signals plotted against the logarithm of protein concentration. Binding constant, KD, was determined using the Hill's equation, log(T­Y)/(Y­B) = h (log[S] ­ logKD), where [S] is protein concentration, h is Hill's coefficient, Y is signal intensities of protein­DNA complexes, T and B are maximum and minimum signals of protein­DNA complexes. All data were analysed by using GraphPad Prism version 4.0.

Purification of BldD and its mutants
For overexpression and purification of full-length BldD proteins, pET-15b-BldD plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). His-tagged BldD (his6-BldD) was purified by an identical procedure to that for the BldDN except for the thrombin treatment and concentrated to approximately 1 mg ml-1. BldD mutants generated from the site-directed mutagenesis were overexpressed and purified by an identical procedure to that for the his6-BldD and also concentrated to approximately 1 mg ml-1.

Construction of a bldD null mutant
The chromosomal bldD gene of S. coelicolor A3(2) was disrupted using the REDIRECT© technology (Plant Bioscience) (Gust et al., 2003). The disruption cassette was prepared by same procedure as described by Elliot et al. (2003). Briefly, a disruption cassette containing oriT and the aac(3)IV gene (apramycin resistance marker) was prepared using pIJ773 as a template and primers (CGA17 and CGA16) that have 39 nucleotide extensions specific for the upstream and downstream of the start and stop codon of bldD open reading frame (ORF) (Elliot et al., 2003) and then, this PCR-amplified disruption cassette was introduced by electroporation into E. coli BW25113 bearing the bldD cosmid, SC9C5 (provided by H. Kieser, John Innes Centre) and pIJ790 for RED-mediated high frequency recombination between the disruption cassette and the SC9C5 cosmid. Finally, unmethylated PCRtargeted cosmid DNA that is prepared using the methylationdeficient E. coli strain ET12567/pUZ8002 was introduced by bacterial conjugation into S. coelicolor A3(2) to allow replacement of the aac(3)IV gene with the chromosomal bldD gene. Despite low efficiency of generating exoconjugants displayed

In vivo complementation experiment
In order to construct a complementation plasmid for wildtype bldD, DNA fragments containing promoter and ORF of bldD were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEMTeasy (Promega) generating pGEMT::PbldD-bldD. Fragment (0.75 kb) of pGEMT::PbldD-bldD was ligated into pSET162 which is made by insertion of a thiostrepton resistance marker at SphI site of pSET152 (Bierman et al., 1992), generating pSET::PbldD-bldD. To construct complementation plasmids for BldD point mutants, 0.75 kb BamHI­EcoRI fragment of pSET::PbldD-bldD was cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham biosciences) generating pGEX::PbldD-bldD. and then, 0.5 kb NdeI­BamHI fragments of pET-15b-BldD possessing bldD point mutations were exchanged with bldD in pGEX::PbldD-bldD. Finally, the 0.75 kb EcoRI­BamHI fragments of pGEX::PbldD-bldD harbouring point mutations were moved to pSET162. The reintegration constructs were verified by sequencing the purified pSET162 series. The complementation constructs (pSET162 derivatives) were introduced into methylation negative, conjugal host strain ET12567/pUZ8002 and were integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the bldD deletion mutant by bacterial conjugation. The proper integration exoconjugants showing the apramycinR and thiostreptonR phenotype were verified by genomic PCR analysis using their chromosomal DNA as a template. For phenotypic analysis, strains harbouring point mutations on bldD were plated on solid R2YE media at 30°C and cell growth were monitored over a 5 day period.
