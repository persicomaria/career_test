In an attempt to change the reaction and substrate specificity of aspartate aminotransferase, several apolar active-site residues were substituted in turn with a histidine residue. Aspartate aminotransferase W140H (of Escherichia coli) racemizes alanine seven times faster (ka,, = 2.2X10-4 s-`) than the wildtype enzyme, while the aminotransferase activity toward L-alanine was sixfold decreased. X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that the structural changes brought about by the mutation are limited to the immediate environment of H140. In contrast to the tryptophan side chain in the wild-type structure, the imidazole ring of H140 does not form a stacking interaction with the coenzyme pyridine ring. The angle between the two ring planes is about 50". Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate dissociates 50 times more rapidly from the W140H mutant than from the wild-type enzyme. A model of the structure of the quinonoid enzyme substrate intermediate indicates that H140 might assist in the reprotonation of Ca of the amino acid substrate from the re side of the deprotonated coenzyme-substrate adduct in competition with si-side reprotonation by K258. In aspartate aminotransferase I17H (of chicken mitochondria), the substituted residue also lies on the re side of the coenzyme. This mutant enzyme slowly decarboxylates L-aspartate to L-alanine = 8X s-I). No P-decarboxylase activity is detectable in the wild-type enzyme. In aspartate aminotransferase V37H (of chicken mitochondria), the mutated residue lies besides the coenzyme in the plane of the pyridine ring; no change in reaction specificity was observed. All three mutations, i.e. W140+H, 117-H and V37-H, decreased the aminotransferase activity toward aromatic amino acids by 10- 100-fold, while decreasing the activity toward dicarboxylic substrates only moderately to 20%, 20% and 60% of the activity of the wild-type enzymes, respectively. In all three mutant enzymes, the decrease in aspartate aminotransferase activity at pH values lower than 6.5 was more pronounced than in the wild-type enzyme, apparently due to the protonation of the newly introduced histidine residues. The study shows that substitutions of single active-site residues may result in altered reaction and substrate specificities of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes.

Vitamin-B,-dependent enzymes catalyze a broad range of reactions in the metabolism of amino acids, i.e. transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, aldol cleavage and ester condensation reactions as well as P- and y-elimination and replacement reactions. Comparison of the about 300 amino acid sequences of B, enzymes known to date has shown that the majority of the B, enzymes belong to one of a few families of evolutionarily related enzymes (Alexander et al., 1994). The member enzymes of such a family use a similar protein scaffold to catalyze quite diverse reactions. The most extensively investigated pyridoxal-5'-phosphatedependent enzyme is probably aspartate aminotransferase (AspCorrespondence f o E.

AT) which catalyzes the reversible transfer of the amino group of L-aspartate or L-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate or oxalacetate. The aminotransferases, with very few exceptions, belong to the a-family of B, enzymes (Mehta et al., 1993; Alexander et al., 1994). AspAT also catalyzes the racemization of amino acids. This slow side reaction occurs only once during lo7transamination cycles (chicken mitochondrial AspAT) and is due to the reprotonation of the coenzyme-substrate adduct at Ca from the re instead of the si side (Kochhar and Christen, 1988). No ionizable groups are located at the re side; a transient water molecule appears to be responsible for the protonation at Ca from this side, its diffusion into the active-site pocket being the rate-limiting step of AspAT-catalyzed racemization (Kochhar and Christen, 1992). In this study, we attempted to change the reaction specificity of AspAT by introducing an acidbase group in the apolar region facing the re side (with respect to C4') of the coenzyme-substrate adduct. The following three residues were each replaced by a histidine residue: W140 in aspartate aminotransferase of

The structure of E, coli AspAT (Smith et al., 1989; Kamitori et al., 1990; Jager et al., 1994a) is very similar to that of the mitochondrial isoenzyme of chicken (McPhalen et al., 1992) and the structures of the two active sites are virtually superimposable.

Escherichia coli as well as I17 and V37 in mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase of chicken. W140 is invariant in all known AspAT sequences, {he only exception being AspAT of the archaebacterium Sulfolobus soljaturicus which has a phenylalanine residue instead (Mehta et al., 1993). The indole group of W140 is oriented nearly parallel to the pyridine ring which covers its distal half (Fig. 1). Its Nel forms a hydrogen bond to the distal carboxylate group of dicarboxylic substrates (Jansonius and Vincent, 1987; Kamitciri et al., 1990) and thus, in addition to the guanidinium group of R292" (the asterisk denotes a residue from the adjacent subunit), contributes to the binding of the substrate. The importance of this hydrogen bond in substrate binding is evidenced by the marked decrease in the binding affinity for the dicarboxylic substrates upon replacing W140 by a phenylalanine or glycine residue (Hayashi et al., 1990; Mattingly and Martinez-Carrion, 1990). I17 of chicken mitochondrial AspAT is also situaled on the re side of the coenzyme-substrate adduct and is part of the N-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain which passes in front of the active-site cleft. V37 is part of the lid on the actiwe-site pocket and lies approximately in the plane of the coenzyme pyridine ring. During the domain movement in the transition from the open to the closed conformation, V37 and I17 change their orientation and push the substrate towards the coenzyme (Jansonius and Vincent, 1987; Pan et al., 1993). In AspATs of different species, various hydrophobic residues are found at positions 17 and 37 (Mehta et al., 1993). All three mutant enzymes, AspAT W140H, I17H and V37H, obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, were analyzed for newly generated catalytic activities as well as for changes in the efficiency of transamination toward different types of amino acid substrates.

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA encoding mitochondrial AspAT of chicken was inserted into the NdeV XbaI site of the expression vector pGemex as described previously (Ziak et al., 1993). The recombinant vectors Ml3mpl8/ E. coli AspAT and pGemex/mitochondrial AspAT, containing the DNA sequence encoding AspAT of E. coli and AspAT of chicken, respectively, were used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with a kit from Bio-Rad based on the method of Kunkel (1985). The synthetic oligonucleotides ATG GTT CGG GCT TGG GTT, C CCC GAC CCT CAC CTG GGG GTG AC and ATG AAC CTG GGT CAC GGA GCA TAC CGG were used for the W14@H, 117-H and V37+H mutations, respectively. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977). A fragment of aspC DNA of E. coli, containing the W 1 4 0 t H mutation, was excised with MluI and NcoI restriction endonucleases (from Boehringer) from the doublestranded phage M13mp18 and ligated with the large fragment of the expression vector pKDHE19 from which the wild-type DNA fragment had been cut out with the same enzymes.

The activities were measured by the malatedehydrogenase-coupled assay (see Experimental Procedures). The following buffers were used at 50 mM concentration: Mes, pH 5.5 -7.0; Hepes, pH 7.0-8.5; Ches, pH 8.5-10.0. The differences in activity at the overlaps of two buffers were less than 10% of the total activity; the mean values are indicated. The low activity at pH 10 in E. coli AspAT W140H and at pH values lower than 6.5 in all three mutant enzymes is in part due to a decrease in affinity for the substrate. At pH 6.0, as well as at pH 10.0, the activity measured with 300 mM L-aspartate plus 20 mM 2-oxoglutarate as substrates was 2.5 times higher than that measured at the same pH values with 100 mM L-aspartate and 20 niM 2-oxoglutarate which correspond the to saturating concentrations in the pH range 6.5-9.0.

RESULTS
Catalytic properties of the mutant enzymes. E. coli AspAT W140H retained, at pH 7.5, 20% of the AspAT activity of the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). The K:,, values for aspartate and 2oxoglutarate were 62 mM and 0.37 mM, respectively, i.e. 30 and 3 times higher than those of the wild-type enzyme. The pH rate profile of the mutant enzyme was similar to that of the wildtype enzyme in the pH range from 6.5-8.5 (Fig. 2A). However, at pH values lower than 6.5 and at pH 10.0, the activity decreased much more than in the wild-type enzyme. The left side of the pWrate profile closely corresponds to a titration curve of a group with an apparent pK value of 6.2 and very likely reflects the state of ionization of the newly introduced H140. Mitochondria1 AspAT I17H and AspAT V37H retained, at pH 7.5, 20% and 60% of the aspartate aminotransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme, respectively (Table 1). Their pWrate profiles were similar to that of the wild-type enzyme in the pH range 6.5-10.0 (Fig. 2B), but again in both mutant mitochondria] AspATs the decrease in activity at pH values lower than 6.5 was more pronounced than in the wild-type enzyme. Changes in reaction and substrate specificity. All three mutant enzymes were analyzed with a highly sensitive assay for newly generated activities such as racemization or decarboxylation. E. coli AspAl' W140H was found to catalyze the racemization of alanine seven times faster than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). The racemizatiodtransamination partition ratio with ~-alanine substrate (cf. Fig. 3 and Table 1) was 6.1 X10-3 for as the mutant enzyme and 1.3X10-4 for the wild-type enzyme. The racemase activities of E. coli AspAT W140H with L-aspartate (plus oxalacetate), L-glutamate (plus 2-oxoglutarate) and L-phenylalanine (plus phenylpyruvate) as substrates are the same as those of the wild-type enzyme (kLaC 0.8-3X10-5 s-'). = Mitochondrial AspAT I17H catalyzed the P-decarboxylation of L-aspartate to L-alanine as a new reaction (Fig. 4), the /I-decarboxylation/transaimination partition ratio being 2.1 X No formation of ~-alanine from L-aspartate was detected with the

enzyme indicates that the changes brought about by the mutation are limited to the immediate environment of the substituted residue (Fig. 5). In contrast to the tryptophan side chain in the wildtype structure, H140 does not form a stacking interaction with the coenzyme pyridine ring, the angle between the two ring planes being about 50". The pyridoxal moiety is shifted by 70 pm towards the substrate-binding site. The rather weak density for the pyridine ring of the cofactor suggests only partial occupancy of the active sites by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The inhibitor maleate is bound between R386 and R292*, like in the wild-type enzyme, but, adapting to the changed position of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is rotated by about 30" around an axis passing through the two carboxylate groups. The electron density at the central part of the maleate molecule is interrupted, indicating alternating positions of the methine carbon atoms. Both carboxylate groups of maleate are hydrogen-bonded to the guanidinium groups of the active-site arginine residues and the distal carboxylate group also forms a hydrogen bond to H140 N E ~the position of which is very close to that of W140 Ntl in , wild-type E. coli AspAT. H140 N61 accepts a hydrogen bond from the N142 main-chain N (not shown) indicating that H140 is not charged in the crystal at pH7.7. Proton transfer from H140 to Ca of the substrate can probably occur only with the assistance of a water molecule; in the model, the distance between H140 Nc2 and Ca is 0.38 nm. Two water molecules are bound nearby that, together with the H140 side chain, replace the indole ring of W140.

carboxylic and dicarboxylic substrates ; no p-decarboxylase activity was found. For all three mutant enzymes no other newly generated activities toward L-aspartate, L-alanine, D-alanine, Lserine and L-glutamate were detected. AspAT also accepts L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and L-alanine as substrates for transamination (Mavrides and Christen, 1978; Hayashi et al., 1991; Kohler et al., 1994). In all three mutant enzymes, the activity toward aromatic amino acids was 10-100-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzymes (Table 1j, whereas the activity toward L-aspartate was decreased at most five times. The transamination reaction of L-alanine with 2-oxoglutarate was seven and four times faster in the case of the I17H and V37H mutant enzymes, respectively, while it was six times slower with E. coli AspAT W140H.

Spectroscopic properties of E. coli AspAT W140H. The CD spectra of the pyridoxal form of E. coli AspAT W140H at pH 7.5 and 6.0 in the range 200-250 nm were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme (not shown), suggesting the absence of extensive conformational differences. In the range 250-500 nm, the only difference between the mutant and wildtype enzyme was a 10-nm shift of the 430-nm CD maximum toward lower wavelengths which may be ascribed to the more polar environment of the cofactor in the mutant enzyme.

In E. coli AspAT W140H, the rate constant for the dissociation of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate measured in 100 m 4 sodium phosphate pH7.5 was 50-fold h increased as compared to the wild-type enzyme (Table 2).

The structure of the mutant enzyme with HI40 (thick lines) is superimposed onto the wild-type structure with a tryptophan residue at the same position (thin lines). The direction of view is from the active-site entrance. The positions and orientations of the cofactor (PLP) and maleate (MAL) are most strongly influenced by the mutation.

DISCUSSION
The still high aminotransferase activities of all three mutant enzymes toward dicarboxylic substrates, as well as the absorption and circular dichroic spectra, indicate that the mutations do not bring about substantial changes in the active-site geometry. The crystal structure of E. coli AspAT W140H showed indeed that the differences to the wild-type enzyme are limited to the immediate environment of the substituted residue (Fig. 5). The 50-fold faster release of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate from E. coli AspAT W140H at pH7.5 (Table 2) suggests that stacking interactions with the indole ring of W140 contribute to the binding of the cofactor in thle wild-type enzyme. The further decrease in the affinity of the rnutant enzyme for the cofactor at pH 6 (Table 2) is very likely due to protonation of H140, the binding of the cofactor to the wild-type enzyme being pH-independent. The introduction of an ionizable histidine residue on the re side of the coenzyme-substrate adduct increased the racemizationltransamination partition ratio of E. coli AspAT W140H with alanine as substrate at pH 7.5 almost 50-fold. An increase in the rate of racemization is only observed with alanine as substrate. Apparently, the protonating water molecule (Kochhar and Christen, 1992) finds easier access to the re side of Ca in the case of alanine than of dicarboxylic or aromatic substrates. The side chain of alanine binds less tightly and fails to induce the movement of the small domain that closes the active-site cleft (Kirsch et al., 1984; Sandmeier, E., unpublished). /I-Decarboxylatilon of L-aspartate is a newly generated side reaction caused by ithe I17H substitution in mitochondrial AspAT. The following findings support the conclusion that alanine is produced from aspartate by the catalytic effect of mitochondrial AspAT I17H. Alanine is not formed in the nonenzymic reaction, i.e. in a mixture of coenzyme and aspartate plus oxalacetate. Furthermore, neither the wild-type enzyme nor mitochondrial AspAT V37H isolated by the same procedure as mitochondrial AspAT I17H show /3-decarboxylase activity. Two different mechanisms are conceivable for the /I-decarboxylation of aspartate to alanine: (a) direct decarboxylation to alanine and the pyridoxal form of the enzyme or (b) decarboxylation-transamination to pyruvate and the pyridoxamine form of the enzyme followed by conversion of pyruvate to alanine. Both pathways re-

quire deprotonation at Ca of the substrate; they deviate from one another in the reprotonation step which occurs either at C4` or Ca of the cofactor, respectively (Tate and Meister, 1969). Newly generated aspartate /I-decarboxylase activity was also observed in the double mutant E. coli AspAT Y225RR386A with a re-engineered substrate-binding site (Graber, R., Malashkevich, V. N., Sandmeier, E., Berger, P., Kasper, P., Gehring, H., Jansonius, J. N. & Christen, P., unpublished results). Substitution of a histidine residue for V37, which lies next to the coenzyme approximately in the plane of the pyridine ring, causes neither a higher racemization rate than in the wild-type enzyme nor any new activities. In all three mutant enzymes, the aminotransferase activity toward aromatic amino acids was considerably more decreased (to I-8% of wild-type activities) than that toward aspartate (to 20-60% of wild-type activities). The same effect was observed in an analogous active-site mutant, i.e. mitochondrial AspAT Y70H, which possessed 0.6% and 13% of the wild-type activity toward aromatic and dicarboxylic amino acids, respectively (Pan et al., 1994). Irrespective of the position, the substitution of an apolar residue in the active-site pocket by polar histidine seems to interfere with the activity toward aromatic substrates, suggesting that their side-chain groups do not engage in defined interactions with the enzyme but rather are kept in the largely apolar active site by unspecific hydrophobic effects. This interpretation is in line with the higher efficiency of wild-type E. coli AspAT than of eucaryotic AspATs toward aromatic amino acids; the difference is thought to be due to the presence of a hydrophobic region in the active-site cleft in the E. coli enzyme (Kamitori et al., 1990; Kohler et al., 1994; Jager et al., 1994b). If, in a mutation reciprocal to the present one, polar R292* is replaced by a hydrophobic residue like valine or leucine, the mutant enzyme prefers aromatic substrates to aspartate (Hayashi et al., 1989). The present study demonstrates that the introduction of histidine residues on the re side of the coenzyme-substsate adduct results in changes of the reaction and substrate specificity of aspartate aminotransferase. The finding that changes in substrate and reaction specificity can be elicited by substitution of single amino acid residues are in accord with recent studies on the evolutionary relationships among pyridoxal-5`-phosphate-dependent enzymes. Many of these enzymes have been found to use homologous protein scaffolds for catalyzing quite diverse reactions (Alexander et al., 1994).
