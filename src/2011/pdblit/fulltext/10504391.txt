Two bivalent thrombin inhibitors were synthesized, which consist of a benzamidine-based active-site-blocking segment, a fibrinogen recognition exosite inhibitor and a peptidic linker connecting these fragments. BZA-1 hirulog contains an N a-(2-naphthylsulfonyl)-S-3-amidinophenylalanyl-isonipecotic acid residue connected via the carboxyl group to the linker segment. The active-site-directed moiety of BZA-2 hirulog [N a-(2naphthylsulfonyl-glutamyl)-R-4-amidinophenylalanyl-piperidide] was coupled to the linker via the side chain of the glutamic acid. Both BZA-hirulogs contain almost identical linker-exo site inhibitor parts, except for the substitution of a glycine as the first linker residue in BZA-1 hirulog by a g-amino butyric acid in BZA-2 hirulog, thus increasing flexibility and linker length by two additional atoms. BZA-1 hirulog showed moderate potency (Ki = 0.50 ^ 0.14 nm), while BZA-2 hirulog was characterized as a slow, tight binding inhibitor of thrombin (Ki = 0.29 ^ 0.08 pm). The stability in human plasma of both analogs was strongly improved compared with hirulog-1. For BZA-2 hirulog a significantly reduced plasma clearance was observed after intravenous injection in rats compared with BZA-1 hirulog and hirulog-1. The X-ray structure of the BZA-2 hirulog in complex with human a-thrombin was solved and confirmed the expected bivalent binding mode. Keywords: anticoagulants; bivalent inhibitor; enzyme kinetics; hirudin; thrombin.

The hirulogs [1,2] are highly potent and specific synthetic thrombin inhibitors derived from the naturally occurring 65-amino acid polypeptide hirudin, which was originally isolated from the medicinal leech [3]. Similar to hirudin, the hirulogs inhibit thrombin by a bivalent binding mode. The C-terminus of the hirulogs is almost identical to the C-terminal residuesH53±65 of the desulfated r-hirudin (prefix H used for numbering based on the hirudin sequence), which bind to the fibrinogen recognition exo site (FRE) of thrombin. This FRE-directed inhibitor segment is connected by a peptidic linker to an additional inhibitor moiety, which occupies the active site of thrombin.

The prototype, hirulog-1 (dPhe-Pro-Arg-Pro-(Gly)4-Asn-GlyAsp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Leu-OH; Ki = 2.3 nm [1]), was cleaved slowly by thrombin at the P1±P1 H Arg-Pro peptide bond [2]. Considerable numbers of analogs of the first series of hirulogs were developed to improve their activity and stability. Complete proteolytic resistance against thrombin was achieved first by introducing homoarginine ArgC[CH2CONH]Gly and reduced bond analogs ArgC [CH2NH]Gly as replacement for the P1±P1 H amino acids; the resulting inhibitors showed relatively weak activities with Ki values between 5 and 2000 nm [4]. Substitutions in the FRE-binding [5,6] and linker segment [7,8] enhanced the affinity of the inhibitors by 1±2 orders of magnitude. However, the strongest improvements in activity were achieved by incorporation of more potent and proteolytically stable active site inhibitor segments. One strategy was the introduction of transition-state analogs containing different P1-residues, like arginyl methyl ketones [9±11], a-keto-amides [12] or boronic acid derivatives [13]. A second strategy [14] was the incorporation of an arylsulfonyl-arginyl-R-pipecolic acid active-site-directed segment derived from the potent thrombin inhibitor argatroban [15], which also eliminated the scissile peptide bond after the P1-arginyl residue. A combination of this active-site-directed moiety with optimized linker and FRE-directed inhibitor segments resulted in compounds with inhibition constants similar to r-hirudin (P613, Ki = 270 fm; [8]). A third group represents the rationally designed hirunorms, polypeptides composed of 26 amino acids, which interact with the thrombin active site in a nonsubstrate mode through their N-terminal end as true hirudin mimetics [16,17]. Compounds containing the unnatural amino acid 4-amidinophenylalanine or 3-amidinophenylalanine as replacement for

the basic P1-arginyl residue served as lead structures for the development of highly potent and specific active site-directed thrombin inhibitors [18±20]. Therefore, we assumed that it should be possible to design potent bivalent thrombin inhibitors with such active-site-directed segments. The synthesis, kinetics of inhibition and preliminary pharmacological characterization of two novel inhibitors derived from 3-amidinophenylalanine and 4-amidinophenylalanine, termed BZA-1 and BZA-2 hirulog, are described. Furthermore, the structure of BZA-2 hirulog in complex with human a-thrombin was solved by X-ray crystallography and showed the bivalent inhibitor binding in both the active site and the FRE.

Finally, BZA-2 hirulog was purified by preparative HPLC (anal. HPLC, tR 30.7 min, mass as free base: calculated 2404.6, found 2405.9 MH+). Enzyme kinetics Human a-thrombin (Sigma, 3000 NIH units´mg21) was further purified on SP-Sephadex [22]. Thrombin prepared in this manner was pure and free from proteolytically degraded forms as judged by electrophoresis. The concentration of thrombin was determined by active site titration with r-hirudin in the presence of Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA (Chromozym TH, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) according to a procedure described recently [23]. Thrombin was stored at 280 8C in 0.025 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 50 mg BSA in 100 mL. The inhibition of the amidolytic activity of human a-thrombin was measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 15 UV/Vis spectrophotometer, equipped with a temperaturecontrolled, sixfold cuvette changer and PC for data storage. The measurements were performed at 405 nm in polystyrene cuvettes with Chromozym TH as substrate in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000 at 23 8C. For BZA-1 hirulog linear progress curves were obtained, the concentration of thrombin (60 pm) was significantly lower than the inhibitor (< 1±28 nm) and substrate (7.5±30 mm) concentrations used. The resulting Dixon plot showed a hyperbolic dependency of the reciprocal steady-state velocities vS from the inhibitor concentrations, therefore the data were analysed according to a kinetic model (Eqn 1) described in detail previously [7] for bivalent thrombin inhibitors showing hyperbolic inhibition. In addition to the inhibition constant Ki, this model leads to a value Kr, which represents an equilibrium constant between the enzyme/inhibitor complex formed by simultaneous binding of the FRE-directed and the active site-directed inhibitor segments to thrombin and the enzyme/inhibitor complex formed only through the interaction of the FRE-directed inhibitor segment with thrombin, in the latter thrombin is still accessible to small chromogenic substrates. vS  V max {S/K m  1X6ISK r /K m K i }/1  S/K m  1  1/K r IK r /K i  1X6IS/K r /K m K i }X 1

Chemicals and equipment All reagents, amino acids and resins for peptide synthesis were obtained from Aldrich, Fluka, Bachem and Novabiochem, respectively. Hirulog-1 was a gift from Ferring Research È Institute (Malmo, Sweden), r-hirudin HBW 023 was from Behringwerke (Marburg, Germany). A Shimadzu LC-10A system was used for analytical HPLC [Vydac C18, 5 mm reversed phase column (250 Â 4 mm), solvents: A, 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); B, 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, gradient 10% B to 60% B in 50 min, flow rate 1 mL´min21, monitored at 220 nm]. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu LC-8 A [Vydac C8, 5 mm reversed phase column (250 Â 25 mm), solvents: A, 0.1% aqueous TFA; B, 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, gradient 10% B to 55% B in 120 min, flow rate 10 mL´min21, monitored at 220 nm]. The correct mass of the purified inhibitors was determined with a Perseptive Biosystems Maldi-Tof Laser Tec Research mass spectrometer (Wiesbaden, Germany), the correct composition of the peptides was confirmed by amino acid analysis on a LC-3000 system (Eppendorf/Biotronik, Hamburg, Germany). Synthesis of the inhibitors BZA-1 hirulog (Fig. 1) The fully protected linker-exo site inhibitor part was synthesized by standard fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-chemistry using a Model 396 Multiple Peptide Synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY, USA) on Wang resin. After cleavage of the Fmoc-group the active site inhibitor segment Nas-S-mAdf-iNip-OH Â HCl, synthesized as described previously [19], was attached to the resin-bound peptide [double coupling, threefold excess of the active site segment and (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tris (pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBop) as coupling reagent in presence of 6 eq. of N-iisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in dimethylformamide, for 2 h at room temperature]. After cleavage with reagent K (82.5% TFA, 5% water, 5% phenol, 5% thioanisole and 2.5% ethylenedithiol), the BZA-1 hirulog was purified by preparative HPLC (anal. HPLC, tR 28.1 min, mass as free base: calculated 2291.5, found 2293.1 MH+). BZA-2 hirulog (Fig. 2). The protected linker-exo site inhibitor part, containing an N-terminal g-amino butyric acid residue instead of the glycine in BZA-1 hirulog, was synthesized as described above using solid-phase chemistry. For the final steps the resin was transferred into a polypropylene reaction column (5 mL volume, Abimed, Germany) and the synthesis was finished manually as shown in Fig. 2. The building unit R-p Adf-Ppd Â 2HCl was synthesized as described recently [21].

In the case of BZA-2 hirulog nonlinear progress curves were obtained which were typical for slow, tight-binding inhibitors. The data were analysed as described for hirudin [24], the progress curves were fitted to Eqn 2, the Ki value was calculated from Eqns (3) and (4).

calibration curves obtained with control plasma, to which the thrombin inhibitors had been added). X-ray, crystallization, data collection and model building Crystals of human a-thrombin (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), dialysed against 3 mm Hepes pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl and inhibited with a 20-fold excess of BZA-2 hirulog, were grown from 22 to 32% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 300±500 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4±8.6) at 6 8C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals suitable for X-ray experiments could only be obtained after seeding with small crystals of thrombin complexed with hirugen grown under the same conditions. Ê Diffraction data to 2.0 A resolution were collected at 16 8C using a MAR 300 image plate with a Rigaku rotating anode (CuKa) source. The crystals were isomorphous with respect to hirugen-thrombin crystals (PDB code: 1hgt; [26]), and could be Ê indexed as monoclinic C2 with cell parameters a = 71.32 A, Ê Ê b = 72.41 A, c = 72.33 A and g = 100.278. The intensities were integrated with MOSFLM [27], then scaled and merged with the CCP4 programs scala and truncate [28]. The thrombin±hirugen complex 1hgt.pdb [26] was used as a starting model for crystallographic refinement. Refinement included rigid body, overall temperature factor refinement, positional refinement and individual temperature factor refinement in cns [29] and manual building against 2Fo ±Fc electron density in main [30]. A total of 23 360 reflections in the range Ê of 9.0±2.0 A was used for refinement. The data were 93.4% Ê Ê complete to 2 A (82% completeness in the 2.04±1.98 A shell) with a Rmerge of 9.4% (43.9% in the last shell). The model was refined to an Rcryst of 20.85% (Rfree 24.68%) and contained 150 water molecules. The quality of the model was validated with procheck [31] yielding 85% of the residues in the core region and 15% of the residues in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The rmsd of the bond lengths was Ê Ê 0.0094 A and that of bond angles was 1.52 A.

Pharmacological evaluation Anticoagulant activity. The anticoagulant activities of BZA-1 hirulog and BZA-2 hirulog in comparison with hirulog-1 and r-hirudin were evaluated in vitro on addition of graded concentrations to citrated human plasma using typical clotting assays [thrombin time (TT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time, (PT)] carried out with commercial test kits on a fibrin timer (Thrombotrack 8, Nycomed, Germany; [20]). Stability in plasma. The stability of the hirulogs in plasma was evaluated using a plasma TT-based biological assay (anticoagulant activity). The inhibitors were incubated for 2 h (37 8C) in fresh citrated human plasma at concentrations yielding TT of approximately twofold to threefold the control. The TT of the samples taken at 30, 60 and 120 min of incubation were compared with the control (without incubation) and converted to apparent concentrations using calibration curves.

Kinetics of thrombin inhibition BZA-1 hirulog. BZA-1 hirulog was designed according to a structure±activity relationship of thrombin inhibitors based on S-mAdf, which led to the development of compounds with a C-terminal isonipecotic acid [19], suitable for peptide coupling. The active-site-directed inhibitor, Nas-S,R-mAdf-i Nip-OH, inhibits thrombin with a Ki of 570 nm. The corresponding methyl amide (Ki = 160 nm) and methyl ester (Ki = 17 nm) show an even higher affinity, suggesting that it

should be reasonable to eliminate the negatively charged carboxyl group by coupling to a linker amino group of a hirudin-derived peptide. The FRE-directed inhibitor sequence was selected on the basis of a structure±activity relationship, which resulted in the development of the potent FRE-directed inhibitor MDL-28 050 [5]. This analog binds < 10 times more strongly to the FRE of thrombin than do the residuesH55±65 of r-hirudin, as measured using clotting assays. Kinetic analysis of the thrombin inhibition by BZA-1 hirulog showed hyperbolic curves in the Dixon plot (Fig. 3). This kinetic behavior has already been described for other types of hirulog with moderate potency. Among these structures were compounds with very short linker segments [7] or inhibitors with Arg to Lys substitutions in the P1-position of the active-site-directed segment [2]. Both modifications probably prevent optimal binding of the active-site-directed segment. Therefore, the additional dimensionless equilibrium constant Kr was introduced, which describes the affinity of the active-sitedirected inhibitor moiety (see above). A Ki of 0.50 ^ 0.14 nm and a Kr of 0.02 ^ 0.004 were calculated for BZA-1 hirulog, when all data points (vS, [S] and [I]) were fitted to Eqn (1). This is a < 320-fold improvement in the inhibition constant

compared with the racemic active site inhibitor Nas-S,R-mAdfiNip-NHMe. However, this affinity was significantly lower than found for bivalent inhibitors with arginine-derived, active-sitedirected segments [8,11,14]. Therefore, we assume that the coupling to the linker-exo site inhibitor portion probably induces a disturbed binding of the active site-directed part of BZA-1 hirulog. BZA-2 hirulog. The active-site-directed segment of BZA-2 hirulog is very similar to a lead structure of thrombin inhibitors, termed Nas-Gly-R-pAdf-Ppd (NAPAP, Ki = 2.1 nm; [18,32]). A NAPAP-type hirulog was proposed recently based on molecular modeling studies [33]. In contrast to the most active NAPAP stereoisomer containing a R-pAdf in position P1, it was suggested to incorporate an Nas-Gly-S-pAdf-R-Pip-OH moiety in a bivalent inhibitor. However, none of the proposed compounds were synthesized to confirm these theoretical predictions. We have prepared Nas-Gly-S,R-pAdf-S,R-Pip-OH and found that the substitution of the C-terminal piperidine moiety of NAPAP by a pipecolic acid resulted in a drastic decrease in affinity (Ki = 1400 nm, unpublished results). A similar poor activity was also observed for NAPAP containing only S-pAdf (Ki = 1400 nm) [32]. Therefore, a different way to design a NAPAP-type hirulog was chosen.

Fig. 7. View of the entire thrombin/BZA-2 hirulog complex (A) and stereoview of the active-site region of the human a-thrombin/BZA-2 hirulog complex (B). (A) To clarify the representation only the inhibitor (orange and green) has been displayed with its side chains. The inhibitor is not entirely defined by electron density, no continuous electron density was seen for inhibitor residues coloured in green. The region C-terminal of the residue IleH59 could be modeled using the structure of the thrombin/MDL 28 050 complex (1ths.pdb). For the flexible linker residues no model was available. (B) Inhibitor residues and selected thrombin side chains are labeled. The superimposition of BZA-2 hirulog (orange) with the active site inhibitor NAPAP (orange, thin sticks, 1ets.pdb) shows virtually no differences in respective atom positions. For an extensive discussion of interactions between NAPAP and the thrombin molecule see Brandstetter et al. [40].

An interesting further development based on NAPAP is the small molecule thrombin inhibitor CRC-220, which contains an N-terminal Mtr-Asp instead of the Nas-Gly moiety. In addition to the high affinity of CRC-220, it was demonstrated that it is possible to attach additional groups to the aspartyl side chain, such as different types of sugars or poly(ethylene glycols) [21,34]. Some of the analogs had an even higher affinity than unmodified CRC-220. Therefore, we designed BZA-2 hirulog containing a Nas-Glu-R-pAdf-Ppd segment, as seen in Fig. 2. The glutamic acid was chosen to avoid problems of aspartimide formation during synthesis [35] and to increase the flexibility

for the connection to the linker segment. Therefore, we also incorporated a g-amino butyric acid as a terminal linker residue. BZA-2 hirulog showed much higher activity than BZA-1 hirulog and was characterized as a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of thrombin. A set of progress curves fitted to Eqn (2) is shown in Fig. 4. The obtained steady-state velocities were used to calculate a Ki value of 290 ^ 80 fm (Eqns 3 and 4, Fig. 5), which is close to the affinity of r-hirudin (Ki = 230 fm; [36]). The selectivity of BZA-2 hirulog was tested against other related serine proteases. No inhibition was found in case of

factor Xa, urokinase and plasmin at a BZA-2 concentration of 10 mm using substrate concentrations 10 times higher than their Km values under assay conditions described previously [20]. A weak inhibition was observed for trypsin only (Ki < 5 mm), which is reduced compared with the NAPAP R-enantiomer (Ki 0.21 mm; [32]). Pharmacological evaluation Anticoagulant activity. The final concentrations for doubling the plasma clotting times in the respective assays are summarized in Table 1. Only moderate differences were found for the inhibitors tested. The anticoagulant activity of BZA-1 hirulog in human plasma is reduced slightly compared with hirulog 1. In contrast, improved activity was observed for BZA-2 hirulog, which is more similar to that of r-hirudin. Stability in plasma. BZA-1 hirulog and BZA-2 hirulog showed no obvious loss of anticoagulant activity on incubation in human plasma over 120 min (decrease in apparent concentration , 10%), whereas hirulog-1 displayed a distinct loss of activity after 120 min corresponding to a concentration of 27% of the initial concentration only after incubation. One reason for the improved stability of the novel bivalent inhibitors may be the active site parts derived from benzamidine. Another reason might also be based on the modified FRE-directed inhibitor segment. We assume that the incorporation of a C-terminal d-amino acid in combination with the additional prolineH58 residue contributes to proteolytic resistance. Time course of plasma levels in rats. Compared with the activesite-directed inhibitors of the NAPAP-type, we generally found higher plasma levels for all hirulogs, as seen in Fig. 6. Obviously, the distribution volume of the peptidic bivalent thrombin inhibitors is smaller than for the low molecular weight inhibitors. In rats, after intravenous injection of a dose of 1 mg´kg21 each, the plasma levels of BZA-1 hirulog showed a time course similar to that of hirulog-1 with a rapid decline over 1 h. BZA-2 hirulog showed significantly higher plasma levels than the other two compounds at any time. The reason for the lower plasma clearance of BZA-2 hirulog is not yet clear. One explanation could be differences in proteolytic breakdown of the various hirulog-type molecules in rats. In addition, there was no marked biliary excretion of BZA-1 hirulog and BZA-2 hirulog, as it occurs after rapid hepatic uptake of active site thrombin inhibitors of the NAPAP and CRC 220 type [37]. Structure of the BZA-2 hirulog/thrombin complex The crystal structure of the complex between BZA-2 hirulog Ê and human a-thrombin has been solved and refined at 2.0 A to an R factor of 20.85% (Rfree = 24.68%). The electron density for thrombin is well defined, except for the residues Ser1EGlu1C (N-terminus of small subunit), Ile14K-Arg15 (C-terminus of the small subunit), residues Trp148-Gly149D (autolysis loop) and Gln244-Glu247 (C-terminus of the large subunit), as described for other complexes of thrombin crystallized in the space group C2 [26,38]. Figure 7A shows a view of the entire thrombin/BZA-2 hirulog complex. The well-defined Nas-Glu-R-pAdf-Ppd moiety of BZA-2 hirulog binds to the enzyme in an almost identical manner compared with NAPAP (Fig. 7B; [39,40]), including the interaction of the p-amidino group of the inhibitor with the carboxylate group of Asp198 in the thrombin specificity pocket

Ê and the two intermolecular hydrogen bonds (2.7 and 3.2 A) formed between the main chain carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of the Glu residue with Gly216 of thrombin. The bulky naphthylsulfonyl residue is located in the hydrophobic aryl binding site defined by the thrombin residues Leu99, Ile174 and Trp215, and the piperidine ring contributes to binding energy by filling the characteristic hydrophobic S2-cavity. Ê The complex is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond (3.0 A) formed between the amide nitrogen of the peptide bond between the NAPAP-Glu and g-Abu at the beginning of the linker moiety and the side chain carboxylate group of Glu192; almost no electron density was found for the following linker segment (g-Abu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Asn-Gly). This indicates that this inhibitor portion is highly flexible and adopts multiple conformations without forming significant interactions with thrombin. The FRE binding portionH55±59 (Asp-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Ile) is also well ordered and adopts the same conformation as described for other FRE and bivalent inhibitors derived from MDL-28 050 [11,41]. In contrast to these structures, no continuous electron density was found for the C-terminal inhibitor residuesH60±65 (Pro-Glu-Glu-Ala-Cha-dGlu). The order or disorder of the inhibitor segmentH60±65 binding to the FRE of thrombin seems to be strongly dependent on the crystallographic environment of these residues. In several thrombin complexes crystallized in space group C2 the residues C-terminal to IleH59 are not defined by electron density, as seen for the complex between thrombin and the bivalent inhibitor CVS995 [12] and the cleaved form of hirulog-1 [26]. In contrast, these residues, as well as the autolysis loop of thrombin, are ordered due to crystallographic contacts in the orthorhombic crystal packing described for several complexes crystallized at a lower pH [42,43]. The coordinates of the complex between BZA-2 hirulog and human a-thrombin have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (file name 1QUR).

SUMMARY
BZA-2 hirulog is a highly active thrombin inhibitor with a potency comparable with r-hirudin, despite the drastic reduction of the molecular mass from < 7000 to < 2500 Da. Like hirudin and other bivalent inhibitors, BZA-2 hirulog is very specific for thrombin compared with the related serine proteases trypsin, factor Xa, urokinase and plasmin. Both benzamidine-based inhibitors showed higher stability on incubation in human plasma compared with hirulog-1, and the plasma clearance of BZA-2 hirulog was significantly decreased in contrast to hirulog-1 and BZA-1 hirulog. The affinity of BZA-2 hirulog may be improved further by a simple substitution of the Nas-Glu moiety by a Mtr-Asp residue as described for a series of CRC-220 analogs [34], or by further optimization of the linker part [7,8]. However, we assume that the potency of BZA-2 hirulog is sufficient for effective anticoagulation. It should be noted, that the anticoagulant activity in plasma clotting assays of r-hirudin was comparable with that of natural hirudin, despite the < 10-fold difference in their inhibition constants.
