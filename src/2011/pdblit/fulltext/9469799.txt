Structural Basis of Plasticity in T Cell Receptor Recognition of a Self Peptide­MHC Antigen
K. Christopher Garcia,* Massimo Degano,* Larry R. Pease, Mingdong Huang, Per A. Peterson, Luc Teyton, Ian A. Wilson
The T cell receptor ( TCR) inherently has dual specificity. T cells must recognize selfantigens in the thymus during maturation and then discriminate between foreign pathogens in the periphery. A molecular basis for this cross-reactivity is elucidated by the crystal structure of the alloreactive 2C TCR bound to self peptide­major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) antigen H-2Kb­ dEV8 refined against anisotropic 3.0 angstrom resolution x-ray data. The interface between peptide and TCR exhibits extremely poor shape complementarity, and the TCR chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) has minimal interaction with the dEV8 peptide. Large conformational changes in three of the TCR CDR loops are induced upon binding, providing a mechanism of structural plasticity to accommodate a variety of different peptide antigens. Extensive TCR interaction with the pMHC helices suggests a generalized orientation that is mediated by the V domain of the TCR and rationalizes how TCRs can effectively "scan" different peptides bound within a large, low-affinity MHC structural framework for those that provide the slight additional kinetic stabilization required for signaling.

phenomenon of MHC restriction is the basis of the cell-mediated immune response to foreign pathogens (1). The central molecular event governing this process is the engagement of the clonotypic TCR by particular MHC class I or class II molecules in association with processed peptides (2). Upon engagement of the pMHC, a proliferative signal is transduced into the T cell by subsequent activation of the nonclonotypic members of the TCR signaling complex: CD8 (class I) or CD4 (class II), and CD3 , , , and (3, 4). It has become clear that a structural plasticity, or flexibility, in recognition of pMHC (5, 6) and a biological plasticity in response to ligand (3, 4, 7­9) are essential properties for the survival and function of T cells. Thymic development of T cells depends on weak interactions with self pMHC ligands (10). T cells selected for maturation then exhibit high frequencies of alloreactivity, or cross-reactivity, against both self and foreign pMHC complexes in the periphery (11).

This TCR cross-reactivity can manifest itself in a range of different biological outcomes, depending on the pMHC ligand (5­8), and includes agonist and antagonist effects (8), which have been correlated to the half-life of the TCR-pMHC complex and co-receptor association (12). An important question is whether there are structural properties unique to the TCR-pMHC interface that facilitate this broadened specificity. T cell receptor structure determinations have illuminated similarities and differences with antibodies and how the TCR may be particularly suited to bind pMHC (13­ 16). The orientation of the TCR to the pMHC has been determined for two TCRpMHC complexes (15, 16), one of which represents a refined structure at 2.6 Å (16). The overall topology of these complexes could be reconciled with earlier predictions inferred from biological data (17­19). We have focused our efforts on the murine 2C TCR system (20, 21), which is the only TCR for which distinct self (H2Kb-dEV8) (6) and foreign [H-2Kbm3­ dEV8 (6) and H-2Ld­p2Ca (22)] ligands have been defined (23). Thymocytes of 2C transgenic mice are positively selected in the presence of H-2Kb and negatively selected in the presence of the allo-ligands H-2Kbm3 (a naturally occurring, two­amino acid mutant of H-2Kb) or H-2Ld (21). dEV8 is a murine self-peptide, derived from intracellular processing of the murine mitochondrial respiratory protein complex (MLRQ), that was eluted from H-2Kb- and H-2Kbm3bearing cells (6). When bound to H-2Kb,

dEV8 is a weak agonist for the 2C cytotoxic T cell but a strong agonist for the 2C alloligand H-2Kbm3. Therefore, dEV8 may be one of a number of peptides bound to H-2Kb that is capable of selecting 2C thymocytes (6). A crystal structure of 2C in complex with H-2Kb­ dEV8 can allow us to explain how just two amino acid changes are sufficient to convert H-2Kb into an alloreactive ligand (21). We report here the refined crystal structure of the mouse 2C TCR in complex with mouse MHC class I H-2Kb bound to the self-peptide dEV8 (EQYKFYSV) (24). We also briefly describe the 2.3 Å structure of H-2Kb­ dEV8, which, along with the unliganded 2.5 Å structure of the 2C TCR (15), allows us to assess whether there are structural alterations in either the TCR or pMHC upon complexation. We can now more clearly explain the degenerate specificity of TCR-pMHC interaction in terms of a structural plasticity in the TCR-pMHC interface. The ability to alter the shape of the TCR combining site through deformation of the peptide-contacting complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops and their side chain orientations, along with large unfilled spaces in the interface, permits useful accommodation of different ligands. This in turn gives rise to the biological and functional plasticity that is based on varying affinities and stabilities observed in most TCR systems in the in vivo signal transduction events. Overall structure. The 2C TCR and H-2Kb­ dEV8 were expressed and purified from Drosophila melanogaster cells and cocrystallized (23). The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined with the use of multidomain realspace averaging and torsion angle dynamics (25) (Table 1). The diffraction of these crystals is markedly anisotropic along the b* direction, thus limiting the effective resolution of the refined structure (maximum resolution along a* and c* is beyond 3.0 Å, but only 4.2 Å along b*). Despite the presence of this anisotropic decay, all of the domains of the two TCR-pMHC complexes in the asymmetric unit are ordered (26), with the highest quality electron density being in the TCR-pMHC interfaces. The relation of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit (27) does not support other crystallographically derived dimerization models for TCR-pMHC complexes (28). The overall relative orientations of the TCR and pMHC in the refined 2C­H-2Kb­ dEV8 complex are identical to those derived from the original molecular replacement solution (15). The TCR crosses the pMHC in an approximate diagonal orientation, in which the TCR chain lies over the bound peptide NH2-terminal residues

and the chain covers the peptide COOHterminal residues (Figs. 1 and 2). Given the steric limitations that the MHC helices place on the depth of the approach of the TCR to the bound peptide, the diagonal orientation allows for the deepest docking solution of the TCR CDRs onto the pMHC surface. The unusual noncanonical fold of the TCR C domain (15) is confirmed in each of the two complexes. The TCR-pMHC interface. About 1876 Å2 of surface is buried in the 2C-Kb interface, of which 900 Å2 is contributed by the TCR and 976 Å2 by the pMHC (25). Within the pMHC composite surface, about 222 Å2, or 23% of the total, constitutes the bound dEV8 peptide, and 754 Å2 (77%) the buried surface from the MHC helices. The small fraction of surface contributed by the peptide is a reflection of its deeply buried location within Kb molecules, which limits the amount of exposed surface area, as originally proposed in the H-2Kb­ VSV and H-2Kb­SEV structures (29). In the A6­HLA-A2­Tax complex (16), the total buried surface area in the interface is similar (30), but the peptide fraction is greater (33%). All of the 2C TCR CDRs contribute to the buried surface area in the interface (Fig. 1), contrary to the situation seen in the structure of the human A6 TCR in complex with HLA-A2­Tax (30), where chain CDRs 1 and 2 make essentially no contributions (16). For 2C, slightly more surface is buried by the chain (470 Å2) than the chain (430 Å2), but within each chain the distribution of buried surface area by the CDRs varies: CDR1 , 214 Å2; CDR2 , 110 Å2; CDR3 , 140 Å2; CDR1 , 160 Å2; CDR2 , 167 Å2; CDR3 , 89 Å2; and HV4, 10 Å2. CDR3 contributes the least buried surface of all the CDRs and is positioned over a largely empty pocket in the interface (Fig. 1). The overall contact surface is formed from 21 TCR, 16 MHC, and 5 peptide residues (Table 2). TCR contacts with the MHC helices. Of the 41 total intermolecular contacts between the TCR and pMHC, 27 are derived from CDR contacts with highly conserved MHC 1 and 2 -helical residues (Table 2). CDRs 2 and 2 lie directly on top of the 2 and 1 helices, respectively, and, therefore, interact exclusively with the MHC (Fig. 2). CDRs 1 and 1 lie between the helices and are thus able to contact both peptide and MHC simultaneously. As originally speculated (15), the paucity of bulky side chains at the apices of CDRs 2 and 3 in both chains (Fig. 2A) allows the 2C TCR to approach the MHC heavy chain so as to maximize main chain van der Waals contacts and to position the two CDR3s to "read-out" the contents of the

A partial translation function map, calculated after fixing the already-positioned TCR-pMHC complex and using the model in the same orientation for the three-dimensional search, was manually inspected for the existence of a peak related by this intermolecular cross vector to the original solution. A 6.5 peak located at (0.97, 0.82, 0.87) met this requirement. The second complex in the asymmetric unit was located on the basis of this solution of the translation function. Five envelopes encompassing the variable portion and constant regions of the TCR, the 1 2 domain and peptide of Kb, the 3 domain of Kb, and 2M were generated with MAMA (25), and the rotation and translation matrices relating the different domains were calculated and improved with an electron density correlation optimization algorithm (RAV E ) (25). Phases were calculated from the model to 5.5 Å, refined through real-space averaging and solvent flattening with RAVE, and gradually extended to 3.0 Å in 40 cycles. Electron density maps calculated from the improved phases allowed unambiguous rebuilding of the regions that underwent structural changes and allowed the introduction of the correct dE V8 peptide sequence. The structure was refined with positional and torsion angle dynamics refinement (25), restraining the main chain and side chain atom positions of the model by means of harmonic force constants, by using the program X-PLOR 3.851 (25). The model was rebuilt with the program O (25), according to A-weighted electron density maps (25), real-space averaged maps, and "shake" omit maps calculated after 10% of the model was omitted (25). Progress of the refinement was monitored by the decrease of Rfree (25) calculated from 4% of the unique data (1435 reflections). The anisotropic diffraction was partially corrected by introduction of an overall anisotropic tensor (B11 14.6 Å2 , B22 ­11.0 Å2, B33 14.9 Å2), which increased the atomic displacement parameter array by 17 Å2 (the relative B values before the correction were V 22 Å2, V 25 Å2, C 38 Å2, C 26 Å2, Kb-dE V8 24 Å2, and 2M 26 Å2). Refinement was begun with strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints and later substituted by restraints to minimize Rfree. A flat bulk solvent correction was applied. Individual isotropic temperature factors were refined, resulting in a similar decrease in the conventional and free R values (3.1% drop in Rfree and 3.7% drop in Rcryst compared with a 0.4% drop in Rfree and 1.0% drop in Rcryst when refining two B values per residue), and acceptable Ramachandran plots [calculated with PROCHECK (25)]. Three ordered water molecules were located in the interface based on 3 Fo ­ Fc residual electron density and added to the final model. The crystallization, data collection, and structure determination of H-2Kb­ dE V8 are described in (50). SCIENCE VOL. 279 20 FEBRUARY 1998 1167

peptide binding groove. The predominant interaction of the TCR with the MHC helices in this complex, as also observed in the A6­HLA-A2­Tax complex (16), provides structural confirmation of long-standing hypotheses that the TCR repertoire must have evolved primarily with reactivity toward conserved features of the MHC heavy chain so that the most diverse portions of the receptor can discriminate among antigenic peptides (17­19). A number of contacts (Table 2) at the periphery of the interface between the MHC helices and CDRs 1 and 2 appear to be between highly conserved residues and may play a key role in dictating (or steering) a generalized orientation. In particular, Ser27 of CDR1 , which hydrogen bonds to the conserved Kb residue Glu58 (Fig. 3A), and Ser51 of CDR2 [contacts Glu166 (Fig. 3A)] are the most frequently occurring residues to occur in V gene sequences at these positions (31). These interactions between conserved residues are consistent with recent data indicating a critical role for V residues 27 and 51 in the restriction of particular murine TCRs (V 3.1 and V 3.2) for MHC class I versus class II (32). In class II MHC molecules, the approximate corresponding residues of the class I H-2Kb Glu58 and Glu166 are different but still highly conserved (33). Other potentially conserved contacts appear between (Tyr31 ) and (His29 , Glu56 ) chain residues to the MHC helices (Table 2). Overall, the V CDR1 and CDR2 contact residues appear to be more highly conserved not only within Kb-restricted TCRs but also across other TCRs compared with the corresponding chain contact residues. In the A6­HLA-A2­Tax crystal structure, the A6 TCR V has a similar overall orientation as V in our complex, but it has minimal contact between the chain CDRs 1 and 2 and the pMHC. These similarities and differences would strongly infer that it is the chain that dictates the orientation of that complex (discussed below). A conserved framework for TCR binding to the MHC helices, or a generalized orientation, would enhance the flexibility in pMHC recognition by providing a scaffold in which the centrally located peptide can be finely sampled by the TCR (18). A large, conserved buried surface of relatively low affinity would facilitate short-lived complex formation by the TCR and MHC and subsequent "scanning" of the peptide (34). A naturally occurring mutant of H-2Kb, termed H-2Kbm3 (Asp77 to Ser, Lys89 to Ala), is an alloreactive ligand for, and negatively selects, the 2C TCR (21). When bound to dEV8, H-2Kbm3 generates a strong 2C cytotoxic T cell response (6). Of the two mutations in H-2Kbm3, Asp77 to Ser has

been identified as the one that causes the alloreactive response (21). In the 2C­H2Kb­ dEV8 structure, Asp77 lies underneath CDR2 but does not contact 2C; instead, it forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain of the P8 peptide residue. Replacement of Asp77 with Ser could disrupt this peptide contact and potentially alter the position of the peptide residues in contact with the TCR (especially SerP7) and also the conformation of the COOH-terminal region of the 1 helix, which is in contact with CDR2 . Additionally, removal of the Asp77 negative charge would alter the electrostatics of this patch of pMHC surface, which is buried by the TCR (35). Hence, even though Asp77 is not in direct contact with the TCR, its removal would clearly cause structural and electrostatic changes perceptible to 2C and lead to an alloreactive response. TCR contact with bound peptide. The dEV8 peptide (EQYKFYSV) (24) runs from CDR1 to CDR1 diagonally across the TCR surface between CDRs 3 and 3 (Fig. 2B), which lie primarily within the peptide

binding groove between the helices (Fig. 2D). The TCR interaction with the peptide is mediated directly and indirectly by hydrogen bonds to the functional groups of the upward-facing side chains (P1, P4, P6, and P7) from CDRs 1 , 1 , 3 , and 3 , which are in simultaneous contact with the 1 and 2 helices of the MHC (Figs. 1 and 2). The large hydrophobic central cavity between CDRs 3 and 3 remains unfilled, contrary to our previous expectations (15); CDR3 appears to have only a very limited interaction with the peptide at residue TyrP6 through a single contact with Gly97 (Fig. 3B). Thus, CDR3 , which has been implicated in playing a primary role in peptide recognition in other TCRs (16, 36), has negligible direct contact with the dEV8 peptide in our complex. Overall, the interface between the TCR and pMHC exhibits poor shape complementarity (37), large empty spaces, and precarious peptide contacts, which is consistent with the weak affinity of this complex (dissociation constant, KD, of 10 5M)

residues, such as in the highly reactive synthetic peptide complex H-2Kb­SIYR (SIYRYYGL) (24, 38), which contains different residues at the up-pointing P1, P4, and P7 positions, and in the 2C alloreactive ligand H-2Ld­p2Ca (22), where the upward-facing positions of the p2Ca peptide contain Pro, Phe, and Asp residues (35). The poor complementarity of this self peptide­TCR interface is consistent with data that suggest self peptides involved in thymic positive selection may not have exquisite specificity for a particular TCR (39) but instead cross-react with many TCRs. dEV8 is probably one of a degenerate set of peptides that positively select 2C (6), so its

precarious contacts with 2C are consistent with this promiscuous role. The 2C­H-2Kb­ dEV8 complex also suggests the possibility of structural limitations to achieving significantly higher TCR-pMHC affinities than those within the range selected for during thymic maturation. The total buried surface area and the number of intermolecular interactions is similar to those found in high-affinity interfaces between proteins (40), but the shape complementarity in the center of this interface, between TCR and peptide, is extremely poor (37).

complementarity (37), the peptide surface is effectively "held away" from the TCR combining site surface by the MHC helices, thus severely limiting the intimacy of this contact. That the CDRs simultaneously contact MHC helical residues and peptide antigen bears on the issue of a bias in V-region subtypes toward particular antigens (41). In the 2C-Kb structure, the bound peptide contacts both V (CDRs 1 and 3) and J (CDR3) segments of the V , and V (CDR1) and D (CDR3) segments of the chain (Table 2). Contacts of the V region with the bound peptide by both and chains would skew the chain distribution toward sequences that can satisfy the dual requirements of recognition of both MHC helices (either conserved or polymorphic positions on the 1 and 2 helices) and peptide side chains (18, 42). Comparison of liganded and unliganded TCR and pMHC. Comparison of the complex structure with the 2.5 Å unliganded 2C structure (15) and the 2.3 Å crystal structure of H-2Kb­ dEV8, which we only briefly describe here, has enabled us to identify large structural rearrangements that significantly affect the TCR-pMHC interaction. For 2C, the liganded and unliganded TCRs superimpose closely, showing no major domain rearrangements (26, 43). However, large accommodative movements have occurred in the three CDRs that are most intimately associated with peptide (Fig. 4A). The magnitude of these changes are large when compared with those seen so far in protein-antibody complexes (44). CDR1 has undergone a hinge movement of 4.2 Å between residues 25 and 29 to avoid collision with the MHC 1 helix (Fig. 4A). CDR3 residues 99 to 102 [3.2 Å root mean square deviation (rmsd)] have undergone the largest conformational change of all the CDRs. In the unliganded 2C, this CDR has a type II turn, with Phe100 protruding from the tip [see figure 8A in (15)]. In the complex, it is instead bent back by 6 Å so that the tip of the CDR interacts with the MHC 2 helix (Figs. 3B and 4A). The conformation of CDR3 is similar to that in the unliganded structure, with the exception of a small segmental shift ( 1 to 2 Å) (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with its minimal direct contact with the pMHC surface (Table 2). The lack of movement of the other CDRs that primarily contact the MHC helices is consistent with their involvement in conserved interactions (Fig. 4A). These large conformational adjustments to the pMHC (Fig. 4A), especially for the peptide-contacting CDRs, is an additional mechanism of enhancing the

TCR recognition repertoire and accommodating multiple peptide ligands. In antibodies, large CDR conformational changes, particularly in CDR-H3, have been documented upon antigen binding, particularly with peptides and small molecules (45). Analogous to the TCR, which does not undergo affinity maturation, germline antibodies have been seen to utilize conformational change as a means of compensating for nonoptimal complementarity to their antigen (46). However, the major conformational changes in the TCR are localized to the combining site and do not appear to have propagated through the molecule to the constant domains that presumably interact with the signal-transducing CD3 chains. The H-2Kb­ dEV8 undergoes much less conformational adjustment in the binding interface than the TCR, but a large change has occurred in the positions of the 3- 2M domains relative to the 1 2 domains (Fig. 4B). The 3- 2M domains undergo a large torqueing in their pairing (15o) and a swiveling around Leu178 (Fig. 4B) (43), which has been implicated as a pivot point for 3 movement in the HLA-A2­CD8 complex (47). Whether these domain changes are the result of engagement of the TCR remains unclear. Comparison of 2C­H-2Kb­ dEV8 to A6­HLA-A2­Tax. The most obvious differences between the two complexes are the extents to which the TCR chains contact the pMHC and the TCR-MHC contacts used (16), given that the overall footprints are roughly similar. In striking contrast to 2C, the A6 TCR chain CDRs 1 and 2

have essentially no contact with the pMHC surface (with the exception of one CDR1 interaction); the A6 CDR3 has a vast footprint covering the whole COOH-terminal half of the peptide (16, 30) (Fig. 4C). The difference in the chain position is not solely due to the long CDR3 of A6, however. The pairing of the A6 TCR and chains deviates greatly from 2C ( 11o) and is highly unusual compared with the VH-VL interfaces of antibodies (26, 40). These two TCR-pMHC complexes suggest that the V domains appear to be dominant in the orientation (but not necessarily in energetics) of the TCR-pMHC complex. This notion is supported by the relatively close superposition of the 2C V with A6 V in their respective pMHC complexes, and the fact that the A6 V CDRs 1 and 2 do not contribute substantially to the interaction of that complex. There is an extremely close superposition of both CDRs 1 and 2 of the chain and the corresponding residue positions 27 and 51 , which have been implicated by mutagenesis as being key in determining the class I or class II restriction of a TCR (32). In both complexes, Ser27 interacts with Glu58 of the 1 helix, which is highly conserved in MHC heavy chains, and Ser51 contacts Ala158 (in 2C this Ser51 also contacts Gly162 and Glu166). Although the overall TCR V domain incident angle with the pMHC surface is quite different, the tips of the CDRs 1 and 2 contacting the MHC helices fall in very similar positions. An equally important difference in the two complexes is the TCR contact with, and respective positions of, the dEV8 and Tax

peptides. The A6 TCR has more extensive direct interactions with the Tax peptide, although the TCR-pMHC interface still exhibits poor shape complementarity and predominantly helical contact (16, 37). The closer abutment of the A6 TCR to the peptide is partially a result of the Tax peptide sitting higher in the MHC binding groove (16) than when dEV8 is bound to H-2Kb. The more extensive A6 contact with Tax is consistent with this peptide's greater antigenicity (48) compared with the weakly agonistic dEV8 peptide in the 2C system. The accessibility of the Tax peptide epitope could be manifested in an energetic stabilization of the A6­HLA-A2­Tax complex, leading to a strong immune response. Thus, the strikingly different extents of peptide contact in the two complexes is potentially rationalized by the biological origins of these two different TCR-pMHC complexes.

Only one of the two complexes (molecule 1) has been used for the analysis here. When the 2C TCR in the complex is compared with the unliganded 2C, the individual and chains superimpose with rmsd's of 1.2 and 0.7 Å, respectively, over all carbons. The pairing of the V and V domains has slightly changed by 3.5° in the complex, the elbow angle relating the pseudo twofold symmetry of the V V to the C C has remained constant at 148.6°, and the buried surface areas between V -V ( 1300 Å2) and C -C ( 2350 Å2) are also similar. A pairwise comparison of A6 against the Fab structural database indicates that the A6 V -V pairing differs from known Fab VH-VL pairings by between 16° and 28°, which is beyond the normal range of pairing differences seen among antibodies. Pairwise comparison of the 2C TCR in the complex with A6 indicates that an 11° rotation and 2.5 Å translation are required to bring the V domains into alignment after first superimposing the V domains. Methods for pairwise comparisons, superpositions, and measurements of interdomain angles in TCRs and their comparison to antibodies have been described (15). 27. The noncrystallographic symmetry relating the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of this TCR-pMHC complex crystal is of questionable biological relevance. The two complexes are oriented in opposite directions, which would be difficult to achieve in vivo when considering the polarity of the interaction surface of the T cell when in contact with an antigenpresenting cell. However, the situation in the crystal cannot be extrapolated directly to the in vivo environment, where higher order oligomers are an integral step in the TCR signaling complex [ R. N. Germain, Curr. Biol. 7, R640 (1997)]. 28. J. Brown et al., Nature 364, 33 (1993); B. A. Fields and R. A. Mariuzza, Immunol. Today 7, 330 (1996). 29. D. H. Fremont, M. Matsumura, E. A. Stura, P. A. Peterson, I. A. Wilson, Science 257, 919 (1992). 30. The total buried surface area in the interface of the A6 ­HL A-A2­Tax complex (16) is 1800 Å2 (895 Å2 for the A6 TCR and 912 Å2 for HLA-A2­Tax). When divided by CDR the numbers are as follows: CDR1 , 225 Å2; CDR2 , 90 Å2; HV4 , 42 Å2; CDR3 , 216 Å2; CDR1 , 17 Å2; and CDR3 , 290 Å2. These values were calculated with MS (25). 31. S. P.

Colman, J. Mol. Biol. 234, 946 (1993)]. Application of this algorithm to the 2C­H-2Kb­ dE V8 interface gives a value of 0.45. The value calculated for A6 ­HL A-A2­Tax is 0.47. For comparison, antibody-antigen complexes (0.66 to 0.68) and protein oligomeric interfaces (0.68 to 0.75) give values indicating better shape complementarity. The weak interaction of a crystal lattice contact gives a value of 0.35. Thus, according to this measurement, the shape complementarity of the TCR-pMHC interfaces are both quite poor. 38. K.

43. The 1 and 2 helices of free and bound pMHC superimpose closely (0.72 Å rmsd between C atoms) and the dE V8 octamer peptide conformation is highly similar to other H-2Kb­ bound octamer peptides (0.96 Å rmsd). However, in the complex, the dE V8 peptide has undergone a main chain shift of 1.5 Å at the P5 and P6 positions. This shift can possibly be explained by the presence of a water molecule in the unliganded H-2Kb­ dE V8, which forms a hydrogen-bond bridge between the highly polymorphic Glu152 and the P6 backbone amide. In the TCR complex, this water does not appear to be present, because the corresponding Glu152 hydrogen bonds directly to the P6 backbone amide. The different conformation of the TyrP6 1 dihedral angle in the unliganded H-2Kb­ dE V8 is due, in part, to a crystal contact in which the TyrP6 hydrogen bonds to a neighboring symmetry-related MHC molecule. When the 1 2 domains are optimally aligned, the 3 and 2M superimpose with rmsd's of 2.5 and 4.3 Å, respectively (over all backbone atoms). 44. T. N. Bhat, G. A. Bentley, T. O. Fischmann, G.

Crystals of H-2Kb in complex with the dE V8 peptide were obtained from 2.0 M phosphate at pH 6.5 containing 1.0% methylpentanediol by using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals were isomorphous to those previously reported for H-2Kb­SE V-9 and ­VSV-8 peptide complexes (29). A diffraction data set to 2.3 Å was collected at ­180°C (Oxford Cryosystems) on a Mar imaging plate mounted on a Siemens x-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 50 mA with Supper double-focusing long mirrors. Data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (25). The refined model of H-2Kb ­VSV (29) was used for the refinement after the peptide atoms were removed. Refinement of the individual 1, 2, 3, and 2M domains was carried out in X-PLOR (25). Rfree cross-validation based on 1217 reflections (5%) was used throughout the refinement (25). Continuous density for the peptide was apparent in the binding groove after simulated annealing. Refinement proceeded by alternating positional and individual temperature factor refinement with manual rebuilding in A-weighted (25) 2Fo ­ Fc and Fo ­ Fc maps with the program O (25). The final model contains all protein residues as well as four N-linked carbohydrate moieties and 184 ordered water molecules. Scattering of the bulk solvent was accounted for by using a flat model. 51. Interatomic contacts were evaluated both on distance and geometrical considerations. Van der Waals ( 4.5 Å) and hydrogen-bond ( 3.5 Å) interactions were calculated with the program CONTACSYM [S. Sheriff, W. A. Hendrickson, J. L. Smith, J. Mol. Biol. 197, 273 (1987)]. The designation "polar" was assigned to hydrogen-bond interactions that were within proper hydrogen-bonding distance but whose geometry deviates from ideality [ I. K. McDonald and J. M. Thornton, ibid. 238, 777 (1994)], possibly because of the atomic error inherent in 3.0 Å x-ray data. 52. We thank F. Carbone, D. H. Kranz, and M.
