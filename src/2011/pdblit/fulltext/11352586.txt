Human thioredoxin reductase (hTrxR) is a homodimeric flavoprotein crucially involved in the regulation of cellular redox reactions, growth and differentiation. The enzyme contains a selenocysteine residue at its C-terminal active site that is essential for catalysis. This redox center is located on a flexible arm, solvent-exposed and reactive towards electrophilic inhibitors, thus representing a target for antitumor drug development. During catalysis reducing equivalents are transferred from the cofactor NADPH to FAD, then to the N-terminal active site cysteine residues and from there to the flexible C-terminal part of the other subunit to be finally delivered to a variety of second substrates at the molecule's surface. Here we report the first crystal structure of hTrxR1 (SecCys) in complex with FAD and NADP+ at a resolution of 2.8 Å. From the crystals three different conformations of the carboxy-terminal arm could be deduced. The predicted movement of the arm is facilitated by the concerted action of the three sidechain residues of N418, N419 and W407, which act as a guiding bar for the C-terminal sliding process. As supported by previous kinetic data, the three visualized conformations might reflect different stages in enzymatic catalysis. Comparison with other disulfide reductases including human glutathione reductase revealed specific inhibitor binding sites in the intersubunit cavity of hTrxR that can be exploited for structure-based inhibitor development.

117 suggested differences in activities of cytosolic and mitochondrial TrxR.28 On the basis of its redox properties, the selenocysteine in hTrxR has been reported to contribute to redox signaling and, specifically, to mediating responses to oxidative stress.29,30 Cell death can be rapidly induced by selenium-compromised TrxR1 but not by the fully active selenoenzyme.31 In accordance with the emerging importance of the selenium-containing C-terminal extension of hTrxR, it was postulated that these extensions of proteins represent a general mechanism of evolution of new protein function.32 Here we report the first three-dimensional structure of human TrxR1; NADP+ is bound. We describe three distinct conformations of the carboxy-terminal amino acid chain, which reflect different stages in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Comparison of hTrxR1 with other disulfide reductases gives important information on potential specific inhibitor binding sites.

hydrogen peroxide and alloxane as well as direct reduction of proteins like disulfide isomerase and NKlysine and reduction of plasma glutathione peroxidase via reduced thioredoxin. Its main function, however, is the reduction of the 12 kDa disulfide protein thioredoxin (Trx) to its dithiol-containing form:1­4 NADPH þ Hþ þ Trx-S2 WNADPþ þ Trx-ðSHÞ2 : Apart from its "classical" function as an electron shuttle for ribonucleotide reductase, Trx modulates the activity of transcription factors, supports protein biosynthesis and folding, regulates enzyme activities, serves as an anti-oxidant and can act extracellularly as an autocrine growth factor.2,5 The central functions of the thioredoxin system make it an attractive target for anti-tumor drug development.4,6 In mammals, three types of TrxRs have been characterized: the cytosolic form hTrxR17 and the mitochondrial hTrxR28,9 which share 52% sequence homology, as well as the thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), a hybrid enzyme possessing an additional glutaredoxin domain.10,11 TGR occurs predominantly in the microsomal fraction of testis tissue. Human TrxR1 is transcribed by a housekeeping-type promoter and is regulated post-transcriptionally. Heterogeneity of the 5 untranslated region in mammalian TrxR mRNA results from alternative first exon splicing.12,13 Mammalian TrxRs contain selenocysteine (Sec, U) as the penultimate amino acid.14,15 The speciesspecific usage of the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element makes a heterologous expression of the mammalian enzyme difficult, a challenge that has been tackled by different groups.16­18 Various approaches including site-directed mutagenesis,19­21 selenium depletion 22 and selective digestion or alkylation23,24 proved that the selenocysteine is essential for the catalytic mechanism of human TrxR1. After binding of NADPH, electrons are transported from NADPH via FAD to the N-terminal active site disulfide and from there to the C-terminal redox center of the other subunit, which finally reduces the substrate.15,20,25 The first three-dimensional structure of a mammalian TrxR1, namely a Sec498Cys rat TrxR mutant, was solved by Sandalova et al.26 The protein was found to be similar to GR including the three domain structure of a monomer as well as FAD and NADPH binding residues. Interestingly, most residues directly interacting with GSSG in GR are conserved in rat TrxR although the enzyme does not turn over GSSG.26 Also for hTrxR1 in its truncated form, which was considered to resemble GR mechanistically, this phenomenon was observed and attributed to electrostatic repulsion rather than to steric hindrance effected by the C-terminal extension.27 Recently, the structure of mouse TrxR2 was reported, differing in some key active site residues from the rat TrxR1 structure.28 Conformational changes were observed upon NADPH binding and an active site tyrosine residue was found to be responsible for optimal placement of the nicotinamide moiety. Variations in the flexible C-terminal part of mouse TrxR2

Results
Structure determination We have obtained monoclinic crystals (space group P21) of hTrxR1 overexpressed as SecCys mutant in Escherichia coli containing an N-terminal hexahistidyl tag. The structure was solved at 2.8 Å resolution by the molecular replacement method, using rat TrxR (1H6V) as search model.26 The enzyme is a homodimer in solution and the crystals contained three dimers in the asymmetric unit. The three dimers were essentially similar, differences were mainly due to crystal packing forces and due to the variability of the mobile C-terminal arm, its environment and some loops at the surface. The omit-maps enabled no clear chain-tracing for the Cterminal arms of subunits A, B and F, therefore we finally refined the structure without these residues. The final model (specified below) was well defined by the electron density. The overall temperature factor of the structure is 55.3 Å2. This high thermal mobility within the crystal is further increased by a factor of 1.5 to 2 for the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ and the residues 493­499. The structure was refined to Rfree = 28.7%, the cross-validated coordinate error from a Luzzati plot being 0.5 Å. All backbone torsion angles are within the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final model contains three dimers (AB, CD, EF; subunit A, 10­495; subunit B, 9­494; subunit C, 10­499; subunit D, 9­499; subunit E, 10­499; subunit F, 9­493), six FAD-molecules, six NADP+ , five molecules of 2-methyl-2,4-pentandiol (MPD) and 41 water molecules. hTrxR1: overall structure The overall fold of human TrxR1 is very similar to other homodimeric pyridine nucleotide disulfide

The sulfur atoms of C458 and C458, the N-terminal redox center (NR, C58/C63, C58/C63) and the C-terminal redox center (CR, C497/C498, C497/C498) are marked by green balls.

reductases, for example rat TrxR1,26 mouse TrxR228 and human GR.33 Each subunit contains an FAD and an NADP(H) binding domain, an interface domain and a discrete active center (Figure 1). Superimposition with human GR, rat TrxR1, mouse TrxR2, the theoretical structure of hTrxR34 as well as the structure of hTrxR1 recently deposited by Debreczeni et al. (PDB code 2CFY) reveals an rms of 1.7 Å (857 C-atoms), 0.5 Å (974 C-atoms), 0.9 Å (922 C-atoms), 1.2 Å (962 C-atoms) and 0.42 Å (968 C -atoms), respectively. Structural differences between the enzymes occur mainly at their C-terminal ends. Interestingly, the C-terminal amino acid region is only visible in TrxR structures with bound NADPH (mouse TrxR2) or with bound NADP+ (as the present hTrxR1 and the cited rat TrxR1). NADP(H) binding site Superimposition of the human TrxR1 structure with the structures of rat26 and mouse28 TrxR revealed a similar NADP(H) binding site. The phosphates of NADP+ interact with three conserved arginine residues (R166, R221, R226) and in all known structures the 2-phosphate AMP moiety of NADP(H) is bound in a similar manner. In rat TrxR, no density for the nicotinamide ribose of NADP+ could be observed. In our hTrxR1 structure, the six monomers differ slightly in their conformations of the NADP+ ribosyl and nicotinamide ring, but E341

interacts with the nicotinamide ribose in all monomers. The annealed Fo­Fc omit map shows well defined density at a 3  level for the NADP+ molecule of monomer D (Figure 2). As known from other pyridine nucleotide disulfide reductases, there are two positions for the nicotinamide ring.35,36 In the case of bound NADPH, the nicotinamide ring and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD are oriented in parallel positions to allow electron transfer, in the case of bound NADP+ , the

119 dithiol form. The different backbone courses were built according to 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc difference maps using the two C-terminal cysteine residues as guide. Wrong placement of the sulfur atoms could be easily spotted, since it induces strong positive or negative peaks in the Fo­Fc electron density maps. The different conformations could be confirmed by Fo­ Fc annealed omit maps (Figure 4) in which the electron density at 3  is well defined, especially for conformations CI and CII. In the environment of the C terminus, the structure reveals also different conformations for the side-chains of residues K29, E30, S111, W114, R117, E122, K123 and R351. In particular, three different conformations of R351 were observed, in one thereof the side-chain of R351 points into the cleft built by the two subunits of TrxR (CI, Figure 4(a)), in another one it forms a hydrogen bond to Q348 (CII, Figure 4(b)) and in the last conformation this arginine side-chain interacts with E30 (CIII, green aa chain, Figure 4(c)). In contrast to these residues, N418, N419 and W407 adopt very similar conformations in all monomers, their sidechains are perfectly stacked and interact with aa residues 494­496. In conformation I (CI, blue aa chain, Figures 3(a) and 4(a)), which is found in the active center of subunit F, the redox active cysteine residues C497 and C498 form a disulfide bond. The sulfur of C498 is about 3.3 Å apart from the side-chain of Y116. The side-chain of K29 is in hydrophobic interaction with main chain atoms of G499, and the NZ-atom of K123 is 3.6 Å apart from the C-terminal carboxyl group, but does not point to it. The C-terminal carboxyl end is located in a positive environment built by K29 and K123. The neighbouring residue R351 shows two conformations, in one it interacts with E30 and in the other one it points to the active center. In the active site of subunit D, C497 and C498 are reduced (conformation II, CII, orange aa chain, Figures 3 and 4(b)). The sulfur atoms are oriented into the intersubunit cleft, C498 is fixed by K29. The

nicotinamide ring is believed to be flexible and therefore not visible in GR.1,35,36 Superimposition of human TrxR (monomer D) and mouse TrxR (with bound NADPH) revealed that, after a simple rotation of the dinucleotide forming phosphate groups and the nicotinamide ribose, NADP + coincides with NADPH. In the hTrxR structure, the position of the positively charged nicotinamide ring is stabilized by E341. This glutamate is conserved in rat (E341) and in mouse (E366) TrxR, but in GR there is no negatively charged residue at this position. This fact is likely to explain why the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ has not been seen in GR structures so far. Conformations of the C-terminal redox active site The second redox center of large TrxR (formed by C497 and U498) is located on the flexible C-terminal end of the other subunit. During catalysis, this Cterminal arm acts as an electron shuttle between the buried N-terminal dithiol and the substrate. For this reason, the C-terminal arm has to adopt different conformations, one near the N-terminal redox site to pick up electrons, and another one at the surface of the enzyme to donate the electrons to the substrate. In our study we indeed captured different conformations for the last six amino acid residues (QAGCCG). The course of the polypeptide chain of hTrxR is similar in all conformations up to residue 493; residues K486 and R487 form ionic contacts to E387 and E396, respectively (data not shown). After R487, the chain makes a sharp turn forming an elongated loop up to G496 that runs almost antiparallel to the strand formed by aa 401­407. A second turn directs the very C-terminal part to the N-terminal redox site of the other subunit (Figure 3). We could identify three possible courses (CI, CII, CIII) of the C-terminal arm of TrxR with CI containing the oxidized disulfide form of the redox center, and CII as well as CIII containing the reduced

main chain oxygen atom of G496 forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of the S111 (3.3 Å). The main chain oxygen and the nitrogen of Q494 interact with N419 (3.3 Å, 2.8 Å). Interestingly, Q494 forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain oxygen of C498, resulting in a stable ring structure. As R351 interacts now with Q348, it points away from the active site. In this conformation, the distance between the E122 carboxyl group and the C-terminal carboxyl group is only 3 Å, thus fixing the very C-terminal aa chain of TrxR. Compared to CI, the last six residues are moved towards the surface. Due to this movement the distance of the C-terminal carboxyl end from the positive environment formed by K29, K123 and R351 is increased (Figure 3(a)). The conformation III (CIII, green aa chain, Figures 3 and 4(c)) is found in the active site of subunit C and

C497 and C498 are reduced. In this conformation the last four residues are rearranged in an -turn whereby the sulfur atoms become solvent-exposed (Figures 3(b) and 4(c)). The C-terminal carboxyl group interacts with the side-chain nitrogen (NZ-) atom of K29 (Figure 4(c)). The C497side-chain sulfur atom is in close proximity to the oxygen atom of the S111 hydroxyl group (S111-OG), but due to crystal contacts the S111-OG atom points away from the C-terminal arm. A hydrogen bond between the SGand OG- atom would be possible if S111 adopted the same conformation as found in CI or CII (Figures 3 and 4(a) and (b)). In CIII, R351 forms an ionic bond to E30. The side-chain of W114 is switched to the outside because W114 interacts with W114# of a noncrystallographically related monomer. The conformation of the R117 side-chain in CIII is also different from that seen in CII.

(b) Carbon atoms of the hGR residues are colored in grey and the XAN molecule is drawn with pink carbon atoms.

122 5). Superimposition of hTrxR and hGR in complex with a xanthene inhibitor37 revealed a similar cavity in both enzymes. MPD and the tricyclic unsaturated ring of xanthene are located in the same plane and both molecules are bound by corresponding residues. MPD shows hydrophobic interactions with residues L76, L76, A79 and A79 and forms weak hydrogen bonds (3.8 Å) with Q72 and Q72, the side-chains of L75 and L75 are about 5 Å apart from MPD (Figure 5(a)). All of theses residues are situated on the intersecting helices between the two subunits (Figure 1). Corresponding residues in GR, H75, F78, N71 and V74 interact with XAN, which is in addition bound to H82 and forms hydrophobic interactions to Y407 and Y407 (Figure 5(b)). In direct comparison, the propionic acid moiety of XAN37 is located in a channel with a narrow, almost rectangular opening of 6.3 Å × 4.6 Å side lengths, built by the atoms of F78 CB, H75 ND1, F78 CB and H75 ND1. The length of the shorter diagonal between F78 CB and F78 CB, representing the distance between the intersecting helices of the two subunits, is only 7.2 Å. This is sufficient to realize hydrophobic interactions between the protein and the propionic acid tail of XAN without clashes. In hGR structures without bound inhibitors (PDB codes 3GRS, 1GRA, 1DNC), the length of the phenylalanine diagonal decreases to 5.5­6 Å. The regions around F78 and F78 in the cavity are known for their high disorder in unliganded GR and therefore are somewhat flexible and adaptable. It was previously observed that the respective phenylalanine residues re-orientate and become rigid upon binding to the ring of safranine (3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl-phenazinium chloride) from each side.39 This was also revealed in the hGR-XAN structure, resulting in this case in a so-called hydrogen bond network involving XAN and neighbouring aa residues. In hTrxR, the corresponding opening of the intersubunit cavity is formed by A79 CB, L76 CD1, A79 CB and L76 CD1 with side lengths of 4.6 and 4.1 Å. In this case the length of the shorter diagonal (A79 CB, A79 CB) is only 4.2 Å, resulting in a closed channel. A further notable difference between GR and TrxR is the architecture at the top of the cavities, the main chains take a slightly different course and there are several aa substitutions. G439 in GR is replaced by N444, which is only about 6 Å apart from the MPD molecule and could be involved in inhibitor binding. Modeling studies (not shown) indicate that XAN theoretically fits, in an upside-down position when compared with GR, into the subunit cavity of hTrxR and allows, as expected, hydrophobic interactions with L75, L75, L76, L76, A79 as well as with A79. In addition, interactions with the hydrophobic part of the E410 and E419 side-chains are observed. The corresponding residues in GR are Y407 and Y407, which are also involved in XAN binding. The sidechains of E410/E419 are part of the TrxR cavity boundaries and form a salt-bridge to K68/K68. However, the distance between the carbonyl and

Structure of Human Thioredoxin Reductase

hydroxyl oxygen group of XAN to the NE and OE atoms of Q72 and Q72 is too small in TrxR to allow free interactions and clashes are also obtained with the side-chains of N444 and N444. Proper binding of XAN would only be possible if the side-chains of these four amino acids would move. Comparisons with the structures of rat TrxR1 and mouse TrxR2 revealed a nearly identical cavity. In each enzyme the channel at the bottom of the cavity, mentioned above, is closed and an asparagine is located at the top of the cavity. There are some aa substitutions in mouse TrxR2, for example A79 is replaced by a methionine (M110). The side-chains of M110 and M119 could be able to sandwich an inhibitor as seen in GR where the tricycle of XAN is bound between the side-chains of F78 and F78.

Discussion
Differences in substrate binding of TrxR and GR Mammalian TrxR and GR share a high similarity of active site residues and similar reaction mechanism with respect to the reductive half-reaction. Substrate binding and dissociation follow a pingpong mechanism and residues forming hydrogen bonds with glutathione I (GS1, first half of GSSG) have corresponding partners in TrxR (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, the binding site of glutathione II (GS2, second half of GSSG) is not conserved. In GR the carboxylate of glycine II is fixed by an asparagine (alanine in TrxR), the -amino group near the -carboxyl group forms an ionic bond to a glutamate (valine in TrxR). The -carboxyl group interacts with backbone atoms of residues 406 and 469 (Figure 4(a)). In TrxR the -sheet has an insertion in this region, composed of residues N418 and N419. Their side-chains and the side-chain of W407 are perfectly stacked in all conformations observed, thus preventing a binding of glutamate II. These residues could however act as a "guiding bar" for the C-terminal arm in hTrxR during its movement from the inner to the outer side of the molecule. These structural data complement kinetic, mutagenesis and modeling studies on the putative function of TrxR as glutathione reductase.26,27 Snapshots of the catalytic cycle of hTrxR Based on the striking similarity between the tripeptide glutamylcysteinylglycine (ECG) and the C-terminal end (CUG in the wild-type and CCG in the U498C mutant, respectively) of hTrxR and based on the similar conformation of glutathione I and the CI conformation of the C-terminal loop in TrxR, we developed a model for the different positions of the C terminus with respect to the reductive halfreaction. Comparison of the GSSG position in GR with CI of TrxR shows that the last residues of TrxR have to move about 6 Å to theoretically reach the position of the glutathione disulfide. In this modelled conformation, K29 would interact with the

123 reported for thioredoxin reductases from different species including man, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and rat.15,19,25,41 It is therefore most likely that in our study different molecular species of hTrxR were already present in the protein solution prior to crystallization. Furthermore, redox titrations under anaerobic conditions on rat TrxR (SecCys), which is very similar to our mutant hTrxR, confirmed two thiols at the C-terminal redox center together with a disulfide at the N-terminal active site.25 In contrast, the wild-type rat and human placenta enzyme are usually oxidized.15,25 The fact that three different conformations of the C-terminal section of hTrxR1 were obtained in our structure in parallel (including reduced and oxidized cysteine) could be explained by a relatively stable reduction of the C-terminal redox site as described previously for the rat TrxR mutant.25 In our experiment, X-ray data were collected about three months after the crystallization setup. In this time the reduced C-terminal tail could have been partially oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. However, also a reduction of existing disulfide bonds by the X-ray beam during data collection, as seen in other experiments using third generation synchrotron sources, might contribute to the different redox species seen in our structure. To gain further insight into the reduction state of our hTrxR mutant, we determined the number of SH groups in the protein fraction that had been used for crystallization and stored for about one year at 4 °C in the absence of reducing agents. In parallel, different hTrxR C-terminal deletion mutants27 were tested. Most interestingly, in spite of the aerobic conditions, one cysteine residue per subunit was reproducibly found to be reduced and directly accessible in the hTrxR Sec498Cys mutant (data not shown). Also in the 2 deletion mutant, which lacks the C-terminal Cys-Gly, one residue was reduced and reactive. However, in the 8 and the 16 deletion mutants only 0.1­0.2 Cys residues per subunit were found to be spontaneously reactive. This indicates that Cys497 is likely to be the reactive residue and that the C-terminal redox center is protected from oxidation, even over months. It further suggests that the formation of a disulfide between the two C-terminally located cysteine residues hardly occurs spontaneously as suggested previously for the rat mutant.25 The crystal structure shows that among the 14 cysteine residues per subunit there is free access to C189, C296 and C458, all of which are located on the surface of the protein. C458 is reduced in our structure but it is able to form a disulfide with C458. The N-terminal redox center is located deep in the intersubunit cleft and is oxidized in all monomers of the structure. The accessibility of the C-terminal cysteine residues depends on their conformation. In CI, both cysteine residues are oxidized, in CIII they are accessible and reduced. In CII, the sulfur atoms of C497 and C498 are both oriented towards the intersubunit cleft. C497 is more easily accessible than C498 and might be protected

carboxyl group of the C terminus and R351 with Q494 according to the binding of glutathione I in GR by the corresponding residues R37 and R347. Indeed, this alternative conformation of the R351 side-chain was found in CI, leading us to the presumption that CI of the C terminus in hTrxR (Figure 4(a)) resembles an oxidized waiting position. In the next step of catalysis, the reduction of the C-terminal redox center is likely to cause a repulsion from the N-terminal redox center. CII (Figure 4(b)) seems to resemble this state, but both side-chain sulfur atoms of C497 and C498 still point into the inner side of the enzyme. In such a conformation electron transport to the substrate Trx would not be possible. The TrxR wild-type possessing U498 instead of C498, would have a negative charge at physiological pH due to the lower pKa of the selenol compared to a thiol. The structure implies that this negative charge inside the TrxR molecule is stabilized by K29. CII is further stabilized by the hydrogen bond between Q494 and C498, resulting in a new ring structure. This ring is kept in position mainly by residues S111, N419 and E122. In this conformation (Figures 3 and 4(b)) the side-chain of E122 is close to the carboxyl end of the C terminus (3 Å), forming a kind of barrier and presuming that the C-terminal loop is hindered to leave the inside of the TrxR molecule before a substrate is bound. This is biologically reasonable as no electrons are wasted under these conditions. CII therefore resembles a reduced waiting position. Interestingly, the side-chains of E122 and W114 are moved away from the C-terminal loop in CIII and are turned towards the protein surface; the C497 and C498 sulfur atoms are solvent-exposed and therefore able to interact with substrates. Human Trx comprises its redox active cysteine pair within a WCGPC motif. The included tryptophan (W31) can interact with W114 in a similar way as W114 interacts with W114# of another dimer in the TrxR structure. The swapping W114 side-chain might represent a signal for Trx binding and then S111 could already be in favourable position to facilitate deprotonation of C497 during catalysis. For this reason, it is plausible that W114 might be involved in Trx binding. Residues W114, S111 and R117 are conserved in rat TrxR1 and mouse TrxR2, suggesting a similar Trx binding in these enzymes. The newly defined guiding bar, comprising N418, N419 and W407 and residue Q494, the latter being most probably involved in loop orientation, is also present in the rat, but not in the mouse TrxR. The positively charged aa residues K29, K123 and R351 are conserved in all three TrxR enzymes. This indicates that the conformations of the swinging C-terminal arm are different in cytosolic and mitochondrial TrxRs. Reduction state and accessibility of cysteine residues Inhomogeneous redox states yielding mixed species in solution and under storage have been

124 from oxidation by a hydrogen bond with the sidechain oxygen of S111 which is in direct vicinity. C498 is less accessible and interacts with K29. This is consistent with the biochemical data given above: the two cysteine residues do not form a disulfide bond and C497 is DTNB reactive. Presumably CII is the favoured conformation in solution. This is also supported by the structure where CII forms a very stable conformation, due to several interactions with other residues of the protein; probably for this reason CII is defined best by the electron density, compared to CI and CIII. Correlation with catalytic properties The different C-terminal conformations found in the hTrxR structure give new insights into the catalytic mechanism of large TrxRs. As almost all residues required for catalysis in hGR can be found in hTrxR, including the typical dyad comprising H472 and E477 (H467 and E473 in hGR), serving as acid base catalyst,28,34,40 it is reasonable to assume that the last three C-terminal residues of hTrxR have a similar function to glutathione I in GR. The three crystallographically received conformations are consistent with results obtained from mechanistic studies using redox titrations and fast kinetics. As it is known that TrxRs cycle between the two electron (EH2) and four electron reduced state (EH4) during catalysis,41 the structural data seem to reflect the first part of the catalytic cycle, namely the reductive halfreaction. Conformation I appears to represent the Eox species of TrxR with a buried disulfide within the C-terminal arm. Conformation II represents one of the previously described EH2-species of TrxR15,41 with a still buried C terminus that is not yet susceptible to digestion.23 Then, conformation III of the C terminus is needed for it to become catalytically competent. Four different EH2-forms are, for example, discussed in Drosophila melanogaster TrxR, indicating the complexity of reactive TrxR-species during its catalytic cycle.41 Taking into account these data, conformations II and III might correspond to EH2D at different time points of the TrxR reaction cycle. Noteworthy is furthermore the presence of two surface-exposed cysteine residues, C458 and C458, in the interface domain (Figure 1). Due to different redox states found in rat TrxR1 and mouse TrxR2, these residues were hypothesized to represent a third redox pair and were recently tested in mutation analyses.42 In our hTrxR structure the two juxtaposed cysteine residues were found to be reduced and accessible at the surface of the protein. Thus they are likely to be susceptible to modifications by inhibitors or thiol-regulating compounds.

tural rearrangements that occur during redox cycling and cofactor binding and suggests that a kind of guiding bar, formed by the residues N418, N419 and W407 supports the C terminus in finding its way to the surface of TrxR where Trx is expected. In addition, a more detailed analysis of active site residues in human TrxR has become possible on the basis of the structural data. The classification of a set of amino acids within the different conformations gives a structure-based insight into the mechanism of hTrxR. Furthermore, the missing GSSG reducing activity of TrxR has now been structurally corroborated as only residues of the first part of GSSG (GS1) have interaction partners in TrxR, whereas residues of the second part (GS2) have not and their binding is hindered by TrxR specific residues. The similar structure of GS1 (ECG) and the C-terminal end of hTrxR (wild-type (CUG) and the U498C mutant (CCG), respectively) lead to a better understanding of the role of the C terminus with respect to the reductive half-reaction. The functional spectrum of hTrxR and the reactivity of its C-terminal redox center render the enzyme an interesting candidate for inhibitor development.4,43 To simultaneously decrease DNA synthesis and anti-oxidant defense of a tumor cell by the inactivation of one enzyme is a biologically promising approach. A number of clinically and experimentally used chemotherapeutic drugs including the cytostatic agent BCNU, gold and platinum complexes as well as compounds acting at the dimer interface have already been shown to inhibit hTrxR effectively.4,6,44 On the basis of the hTrxR1 structure and available details on the position of the C-terminal redox site, the interface region and the subunit cavity, structure-based inhibitor development will be facilitated.

Materials and Methods
Protein production and crystallization Recombinant hTrxRU498C was overexpressed as a Histag protein in E. coli using the pET28a(+)/BL21 Rosetta (DE3)pLysS expression system and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.27 Washing and elution buffers did not contain any reducing agents like DTT or NADPH. The yield was 10 mg/l cell culture. The specific activity of this mutant protein was determined with the substrates hTrxC73S and DTNB. In comparison to the wild-type enzyme the activity toward TrxC73S was reduced to 1% with a 100-fold lower kcat as described.19,20,27 Crystals of hTrxR1 were grown at 25 °C by the hanging-drop technique, using TrxR dialysed (3 × 0.5 h) against 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA. In the drop (2 l protein + 1 l reservoir + 1 l 10 mM NADP+), the initial protein concentration was 20 mg/ml. The reservoir contained 2-methyl-2,4-pentandiol (MPD) (70%), 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.5). The obtained yellow crystals were stable in the crystallization buffer, the MPD-Hepes-TE mixture could be used as cryo-buffer. No reducing agent was present during crystallization.

Conclusions
The presence of three different conformations of hTrxR in the same crystal derived from different monomers in the asymmetric unit reveals struc-

Determination of SH groups under aerobic conditions To gain further insight into the reduction state of our hTrxR mutant, we determined the number of SH groups in the protein fraction that had been used for crystallization and stored for about one year at 4 °C in the absence of reducing agents. In parallel, different hTrxR C-terminal deletion mutants were tested.27 Enzyme concentrations were determined using the absorbance of the FADcontaining enzyme at 463 nm ( = 11.3 mM-1 cm-1) and verified via the absorbance at 280 nm and the Bradford assay. The concentration of SH-groups was determined using 250 M DTNB in 150 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0). Enzyme concentrations in the assay varied between 2.5 and 5.0 M. In all samples TNB- continued to be produced very slowly over at least 1 h, indicating that other SH-groups that are more difficult to access might also react over time. Data collection and structure determination All diffraction data were recorded by the rotation method and processed with XDS.45 The crystals obey P21 space group symmetry and contain six monomers in the asymmetric unit. The data set (Table 1) was collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation (SLS, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Suisse, beamline X06SA; rotation/ image: 1.0°,  = 0.902691 Å, detector CCD, (MARCCD)). Reflection phasing and structure refinements were carried out using the CNS program suite.46 The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, using the structure of rat TrxR as a search model (1H6V).26 Translation function searches provided a solution for three dimers per asymmetric unit. Rigid body refinement for all six subunits resulted in an initial Rfree-factor of 35% at 3.0 Å resolution. Due to the large amount of atoms in the asymmetric unit and the modest resolution, we used noncrystallographic restraints. In the first rounds of refinement we used tight non-crystallographic restraints (300.00 kcal/mol Å2) for residues 20­480. In the final
