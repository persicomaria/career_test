Fluorescent proteins: maturation, photochemistry and photophysics
S James Remington
It has long been appreciated that green fluorescent protein (GFP) autocatalytically forms its chromophore in a hostindependent process; several of the initial steps in the reaction have recently been elucidated. Nevertheless, the end points of the process are unexpectedly diverse, as six chemically distinct chromophores, including two with three rings, have been identified. All fluorescent proteins continuously produce a low level of reactive oxygen species under illumination, which, in some cases, can lead to host cell death. In one extreme but useful example, the red fluorescent protein KillerRed can be used to selectively destroy cells upon brief illumination. Finally, when photophysical processes such as excited-state proton transfer, reversible photobleaching and photoactivation are understood, useful research tools, for example, real-time biosensors and optical highlighters, can result; however, side effects of their use may lead to significant artifacts in timedependent microscopy experiments.

hand, our understanding of fluorescent protein (FP) structure has permitted the creation of entirely new types of active labels and reporters. Combined with improvements in imaging technologies, detection of reporter activity can be accomplished at the level of single molecules. These new applications will revolutionize our understanding of localized cell chemistry and dynamics, in the same way that GFP revolutionized our understanding of cellular substructure. A plethora of FP-based biosensors and applications have recently been reviewed [6,7,8]. On the other hand, the gaps in our understanding of the maturation, photochemistry and photophysics of FPs can lead to significant pitfalls in everyday applications, ranging from severe artifacts in dynamic measurements to cell death. In this review, I briefly summarize the current status of these three topics in FP research, with an eye to structure/function relationships.

Maturation and structure
The first GFP revolution was sparked by the cloning of the cDNA and the subsequent discovery that chromophore formation (maturation) from the internal tripeptide Ser65Tyr66-Gly67 is host independent [2]. The availability of a gene encoding green fluorescence immediately stimulated interest in two major areas: the puzzle of autocatalytic chromophore formation and the search for color variants. As a result, the process of GFP chromophore formation is now understood in some detail and is summarized as step 1 of Figure 1. The overall multistep reaction depends on molecular oxygen and stoichiometrically produces hydrogen peroxide, but the protein backbone cyclizes even under anaerobic conditions. The process is initially driven by the formation of the unique 11-stranded barrel of GFP (Figure 2), after which the two catalytic residues come into play [9]. Surprisingly, only Gly67 of the chromogenic tripeptide is essential for chromophore formation, as the central tyrosine can be replaced by any aromatic group and still yield FPs. This latter discovery led to the creation of the popular blue and cyan variants BFP and CFP [3]; however, intense efforts to produce a stable red-emitting variant of GFP have thus far failed. The discovery of an entire rainbow of FPs in nonbioluminescent coral reef organisms [10,11] came as a surprise (also turning some scientific expeditions into vacation experiences), but ushered in what should clearly be viewed as the second GFP revolution. These so-called `reef GFPs' are differentiated by novel protein chemistry, but also display unprecedented photophysical properties.

Introduction
For three decades following the 1962 report on its discovery [1], green fluorescent protein (GFP) languished as an obscure component of the bioluminescence complex of an otherwise uninspiring jellyfish. However, when a micrograph of green glowing sensory neurons in a living Caenorhabditis elegans graced the cover of the journal Science in 1994 [2], GFP captured the imagination of an astonishingly large fraction of the biologically oriented world and a good part of the scientifically literate public as well. GFP and its cousins are now, of course, essential research tools in cell biology (for general reviews, see [3­5]), but it is important to keep our progress in perspective. On one

The GFP fold is found with only minor modifications in all known FPs. The panels represent two orthogonal views of a schematic representation of the GFP backbone, showing the enclosed chromophore.

Schematic diagram outlining the process of chromophore formation and illustrating the variety of chromophores found to date in FPs. The chromophores identified as GFP and DsRed are believed to be intermediates in the steps leading to the more complex modifications. The absolute requirement for molecular oxygen and the stoichiometric production of hydrogen peroxide during the maturation reaction are indicated at appropriate steps.

slow and unreliable maturation of naturally occurring reef GFPs usually results in a mixture of emission colors, which, combined with their obligate assembly to yield dimers or tetramers, can lead to experimental artifacts due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) [17,18]. This novel protein chemistry continues, as the acylimine is reactive and, in several cases, spontaneously undergoes additional reactions. To date, six different chromophores have been reliably characterized by crystallography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (Figure 1), several resulting from polypeptide backbone fragmentation. In zFP538 (lemmax = 538 nm), the first residue of the chromophore triplet (lysine) undergoes cyclization with its own a-carbon to form a tetrahydropyridine ring [13], resulting in a two-chain molecule, whereas in mOrange (lemmax = 562 nm) [19], the corresponding threonine cyclizes with the preceding carbonyl carbon to form an unprecedented dihydroxyoxazole ring. In the photoconvertible protein Kaede, a light-driven reaction irreversibly converts a green His-Tyr-Gly chromophore into a redemitting one, concomitant with chain fragmentation [20]. Finally, in the photoactivatable `kindling fluorescent protein' (KFP), autocatalytic hydrolysis of a transient acylimine intermediate forms the ketone shown in Figure 1 [21,22]. The general conclusion from this work
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2006, 16:714­721

Initially, it is convenient to group FPs into two major classes based on their maturation chemistry. The cyan- [12] to green- [13] emitting proteins have chromophores that are chemically identical to that of GFP, whereas the yellow- to red-emitting members undergo an additional oxidation reaction that forms an acylimine within the polypeptide backbone (Figure 1, step 2), as first elucidated for DsRed [14­16]. The red-orange emission (lemmax = 583 nm) arises because the additional oxidation step causes the conjugated portion of the chromophore to extend over the polypeptide backbone, that is to say, the chromophore becomes physically larger, leading to longer wavelength emission. It is clear that this reaction is also multistep and takes place concomitant with protein folding, because the reaction is very temperature sensitive and a stable greenemitting species can easily be trapped. Indeed, the very

and studies on a variety of other FPs [12,13,14,19,21] is that the most important determinant of emission color is the physical extent of the conjugated portion of the chromophore. However, local environmental effects, such as the position of charged groups within the protein, can lead to shifts in absorbance or emission maxima of up to 20 nm in either direction [3,12,19,23]. What is the mechanism of chromophore formation and what determines the final color? Comparisons of the now over 100 available gene sequences reveal that only four amino acid residues are absolutely conserved. These are Tyr66 and Gly67 of the chromogenic tripeptide, plus Arg96 and Glu222 (GFP numbering). Gly67 is obviously the nucleophile in the initial backbone cyclization reaction, whereas Arg96 and Glu222 (see Figure 2 for spatial relationships) are catalytic, as mutation of either severely compromises maturation. By taking advantage of the crippled mutant R96A, Barondeau et al. [24] reported the crystal structure of a proposed precyclization intermediate, which suggested that the protein fold preorganizes the tripeptide in favor of ring closure. Unfortunately, the proposed preorganization mechanism is not universal. In histidine ammonia lyase and several related enzymes, the prosthetic group is formed by an identical backbone ring closure within the tripeptide Ala142-Ser143-Gly144 [25]; however, there is no recognizable structural similarity between the folds of these enzymes and GFP. Recently, groups led by Getzoff [26] and Wachter [27] have investigated the roles of Arg96 and Glu222. Arg96 is an electrostatic catalyst and replacement with anything other than lysine slows maturation to months. Interestingly, in the R96A mutant, the missing function can be restored by the substitution Gln183 ! Arg [26]. Arg96 is believed to stabilize the enolate of Gly67 in preparation for the backbone cyclization reaction; this hypothesis is supported by crystallographic studies of dithionitereduced GFP and BFP, which revealed a trapped enolate [28]. The role of Glu222 is less clear, but experimental evidence suggests that it functions as a base catalyst, possibly to deprotonate the Gly67 backbone amide [29]. The apparent requirement for tyrosine at position 66 is puzzling, as any aromatic group can substitute [3]. A clue to this mystery comes from the bewildering variety of reactions that are observed when Tyr66 is replaced by non-aromatic sidechains, such as alanine, serine, glycine or leucine. Although none of these proteins is fluorescent, Rosenow et al. [30] described the crystal structure of yellowish Y66L. The colored product results from the slow formation of an unprecedented leucine­histidine cross-link. In the process, the aliphatic leucine sidechain becomes oxidized, demonstrating that the maturation reaction is not driven by the aromatic character of residue 66. Barondeau et al. [31] determined crystal structures of

the Tyr66 ! Ala, Tyr66 ! Ser, Tyr66 ! Gly and related mutants and, on the basis of the electron density maps, reported that a variety of different backbone fragmentation, hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions seem to take place. However, before these latter observations can be of practical importance, the products will need to be unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry or other techniques. In GFP, chemistry happens. I suspect that the apparent requirement for tyrosine in naturally occurring FPs is because this particular sidechain is advantageous for stereo-electronic steering of the maturation reaction, which helps to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as those described above. Almost nothing is known about the features of reef GFPs that are responsible for initiating and controlling acylimine formation. The reaction is very slow and often goes astray, suggesting that it is difficult to organize the components productively. Evolutionary trees [32] suggest that red fluorescence is a late development that independently arose more than once. In an astonishingly successful and ground-breaking experiment, several proposed ancestral gene sequences were synthesized and the corresponding proteins expressed. Remarkably, the products were fluorescent, with broad emission characteristics intermediate between red and green [33]. Two salient observations constrain the possible mechanisms of acylimine formation. First, a transient blue-emitting intermediate (probably a neutral GFP-like chromophore) is formed during the reaction [18], indicating that the green-emitting species is kinetically trapped in a dead-end pathway. Second, an additional positively charged sidechain appears to be necessary (but not sufficient) for red fluorescence, as lysine or arginine is almost always found at position 5 in the chromogenic pentapeptide X-Y-G-X-K/R. In DsRed, Lys70 may be replaced only by arginine [23], otherwise a green chromophore usually results. Like Arg96 in GFP, the role of position 70 in the maturation of RFPs is almost certainly electrostatic. The blue chromoprotein Rtms5 (PDB code 1MOU) is an interesting exception, because position 70 is isoleucine; however, the guanidinium moiety of Arg197 occupies the appropriate spatial location and is probably catalytic. As a final note in this section, reef GFPs form extremely tight oligomers (usually tetramers), which is often disastrous in labeling applications. Campbell et al. [34] undertook heroic efforts to solve this problem and reported the first monomeric RFP. Over 30 mutations were made to the parent gene. This work was recently taken to new heights by the innovative use of directed evolution, somatic hypermutation and flow cytometry to select color variants [35,36], resulting in an invaluable collection of bright, photostable monomeric proteins called `mFruits'

(lemmax = 550­650 nm). Atomic-resolution structures have been determined for three mFruits [19], which were useful to explain their spectroscopic properties. Other groups, such as those led by Campbell and Wiedenmann, have produced other bright, monomeric FPs with valuable properties. For example, mTFP1 (teal, lemmax = 492 nm) [37] is optimized for use in FRET systems with a yellow or orange FP, whereas tandem dimers of EosFP offer exceptional brightness and the capability of green to red photoconversion [38], albeit with larger molecular mass.

labels, for example, `optical highlighters'. Here, recent advances in our understanding of two aspects of FP photophysics, excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) and photoactivation, are briefly summarized.
Excited-state proton transfer

Photochemistry
Under illumination, FPs produce toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Among other species, singlet oxygen 1O2 [39] is produced, which photobleaches GFP. 1O2 preferentially attacks aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids in proteins, whereas unsaturated lipids and cholesterol are the primary targets in membranes. However, all cellular components are affected. In the crowded environment within cells, ROS tend to react at sites very close to the site of generation. Researchers studying C. elegans have long been aware of GFP phototoxicity. According to unpublished discussions, survival of the animal requires use of the lowest possible light levels during microscopy. However, the effect is highly variable and depends on illumination as well as cell type. Dixit and Cyr [40] were the first to quantify the toxicity of red and green FPs in plant cells, and gave indirect evidence that the effect was due to production of ROS. An important review [41] presents guidelines to avoid these difficulties, and addresses issues associated with photobleaching and photoactivation. For many applications, the phototoxicity of FPs is low enough to be ignored, which is not surprising given that FPs evolved in organisms exposed to oxygen and plenty of sunlight. However, KillerRed, an FP that literally spews out ROS, has been derived by laboratory mutagenesis of a non-fluorescent chromoprotein [42]. KillerRed is orders of magnitude more toxic than GFP; under mild illumination, this genetically encoded photosensitizer is capable of killing most cells within minutes. KillerRed can also inactivate an enzyme to which it is fused [42], a technique termed `chromophore-assisted light inactivation', or CALI [43].

The archetypal GFP from Aequorea victoria is the only biological system for which ESPT has been demonstrated, which in turn explains the old puzzle of how the two widely separated excitation maxima present in the wild-type protein (A and B) can both give rise to green fluorescence. The B band (excitation 470­480 nm) corresponds to the anionic chromophore, which does not show unusual photophysics. The predominant A band (excitation 390­400 nm) corresponds to the neutral chromophore, which, when excited, would normally emit blue light. However, upon photoexcitation with 370­400 nm light, the pKa of the neutral chromophore changes from near neutrality to near zero, thus becoming a strong acid. Subsequent proton transfer through a preorganized hydrogen-bond network rapidly generates the excitedstate anion, which then emits green light [44­46] (see Figure 3). Details of the proton-transfer reaction have been investigated by ultrafast time-resolved IR spectroscopy, which verified that the protonation state of Glu222 changes as shown in Figure 3 [47]. The pathway is fully reversible and constitutes a tiny `photocycle'; GFP thus offers an outstanding opportunity to study the fundamental physics of proton-transfer processes in a precisely defined experimental system, subject to genetic manipulation. ESPT can be extremely useful for the development of ratiometric biosensors. The technique of ratiometry depends on the presence of either two excitation maxima (as in redox-sensitive GFPs [48]) or two emission maxima (e.g. red and green), the relative intensities of which are altered in opposite ways by external factors. By making two measurements and assuming two-state behavior, the effects of variations in the concentration of the fluorescent indicator and/or the light source intensity can be factored out. As an example of an ESPT-based biosensor, redox-sensitive GFPs have been developed that permit real-time measurements of thiol-disulfide equilibria within cells [48,49]. In these molecules, the reversible formation of a disulfide bridge between two introduced surface cysteine residues modifies the chromophore environment, in turn perturbing the fluorescence excitation ratio. Furthermore, it is possible to partially block ESPT by mutagenesis, which can result in two emission bands. Dual-emission GFPs (deGFPs) are ratiometric indicators that switch between blue and green emission, depending on pH [50,51].
Photoactivatable probes

Photophysics
GFP has been described as `light in a can', a phrase that captures an essential distinction between FPs and smallmolecule fluorophores. The protein shell controls the emission properties in ways that can never be achieved for small molecules in solution. Because changes in the protein affect the fluorescence emission, exciting new opportunities are presented for fundamental photophysical research and also for the development of active

The chromophore on the left, highlighted in blue and marked with an asterisk, is intended to represent the excited state of the protonated chromophore after photoexcitation with 370­400 nm light.

underlying optical highlighters, also known as photoactivatable fluorescent proteins (PAFPs). As the name implies, PAFPs can selectively be turned on by illumination at certain wavelengths and several can, in like manner, be turned off. In a labeling experiment, one can mark a subpopulation of PAFP molecules with illumination at a specific wavelength, and then follow the signal of the photoactivated population with high signal to background ratio. Motion tracking of labeled species does not require continuous monitoring, lowering phototoxicity. This approach greatly reduces the problems associated with photobleaching and continuous turnover of FP markers within the cell. Three recent reviews on PAFPs are available, to which the interested reader is referred [52,53,54]. The mechanisms of PAFP activation are poorly understood and still speculative, but it is useful to group PAFPs into three classes. In one class, photoactivation with violet light (400 nm) gives rise to a large increase (>1000-fold) in green fluorescence upon excitation with blue light (460­480 nm). A popular example is the T203H mutant of GFP (PA-GFP) [55]. A second class of PAFP, cloned from reef organisms, irreversibly switches from green to red fluorescence by an unknown photochemical mechanism, as briefly described earlier for Kaede [20] and EosFP [38]. A third class of reversible photoswitchable marker includes the GFP DronPA [56] and KFP. These proteins are actively being studied by several groups, including mine. KFP is a purple chromoprotein with intense absorbance at 570 nm. It is photoactivated (`kindled') by intense green light, giving rise to 595 nm fluorescence, but in darkness the activated state relaxes thermally on a timescale of minutes [57]. Alternatively, the activated state can be instantly quenched by exposure to 450 nm (blue) illumination. High-resolution crystal structures of KFP have
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2006, 16:714­721

been determined [21,58,59], which reveal the presence in the dark-adapted state of a highly distorted chromophore in the trans-noncoplanar configuration. By comparison, most FPs have chromophores that are cis-coplanar (an important exception is eqFP611 [60], which is trans-coplanar). It is generally accepted that the first step in light activation of KFP involves trans to cis isomerization of the chromophore. Indeed, Andresen et al. [58] were able to observe a distorted cis configuration of the KFP chromophore in illuminated, flash-frozen crystals. However, the fluorescence yield of the activated state is very low and, for each of the published reports, questions have been raised concerning the mechanistic relevance of the observed structures [54]. For example, exposure to X-rays causes oxidative damage to the chromophore and its environment, with unknown effects on photoactivation. Lest this outlook be considered too negative, there is absolutely no doubt that reversible photoactivation involves significant conformational changes within the chromophore cavity. Crystal structures are being elucidated for both the on and off states of several PAFPs and, if successful, plausible models of the process can be expected to appear in the near future. The basic mechanisms of photoactivation and quenching will very probably be applicable to phenomena described in the literature as `reversible photobleaching'. Until these processes are more fully understood, one should keep in mind that these effects are capable of generating significant artifacts in kinetic microscopy techniques such as FRET and FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching). Sinnecker et al. [61] studied the effect of illumination at various wavelengths on several color variants of GFP and documented a dynamic equilibrium between reversible photobleaching, spontaneous recovery and light-induced recovery, as well as pronounced pH effects. Some of their experimental data are reproduced

in Figure 4. It is quite striking that small changes in the illumination wavelength can have opposite effects on fluorescence intensity. The warning sounded by Sinnecker et al. should certainly be heeded, but in the meantime, it will be very interesting to investigate the photophysical basis for the observed effects.

Conclusions
The second GFP revolution, utilizing multicolor photoactivatable probes and real-time biosensors, will take our understanding of cellular processes to ever higher resolution in space and time. On an even more fundamental level, FPs are easily manipulated molecular laboratories for basic research into photophysical processes, such as light-driven proton-transfer and isomerization reactions. Evidently, the gene for visible fluorescence arose only once during the course of evolution, but that was enough.

This paper documents the experimental artifacts that may result from the as-yet poorly understood phenomenon of `reversible photobleaching', often observed for FPs used as labels in living cells. As mentioned in the main body of this review, reversible photobleaching is probably related or identical to photoactivation. 62.
