Oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase (OXG-RCBH) is a unique exo--1,4-glucanase that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 74. The enzyme recognizes the reducing end of xyloglucan oligosaccharides and releases two glucosyl residue segments from the reducing end of the main chain. Previously, we reported that OXG-RCBH consists of two sevenbladed -propeller domains. There is a large cleft between the two domains, and a unique loop encloses one side of the active site cleft. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the OXG-RCBH-substrate complex determined to a resolution of 2.4 Å. The substrate bound to the cleft, and its reducing end was arranged near the loop region that is believed to impart OXG-RCBH with its activity. We constructed a deletion mutant of the loop region and conducted a detailed analysis. A deletion mutant of the loop region showed endo-activity with altered substrate recognition. More specifically, cleavage occurred randomly instead of at specific sites, most likely due to the misalignment of the substrate within the subsite. We believe that the loop imparts unique substrate specificity with exo-mode hydrolysis in OXG-RCBH.

Introduction
Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide found in plant cell walls and seeds. It consists of a cellulose-like backbone of -1,4-linked D-Glcp residues (-1,4 K.Y. and H.K. equally contributed to this study. E-mail address of the corresponding author: k-yaoi@aist.go.jp

glucan) with xylose side-chains -D-Xylp-(16)-. Other sugars, such as Gal, Ara, and Fuc, are also appended to the side-chains in various ways. The branching patterns depend on the species of plant. The structures of the side-chains of xyloglucan are commonly represented using single-letter nomenclature;1 for example G, X, and L refer to an unbranched Glc residue, an -D-Xylp-(16)--DGlcp segment, and a -D-Galp-(12)- -D-Xylp(16)--D-Glcp segment, respectively.

54 walls, xyloglucan forms hydrogen bonds with cellulose microfibrils, forming a cellulose-xyloglucan network. The network undergoes partial disassembly for cell expansion and development.2 Xyloglucan oligosaccharide accelerates cell elongation in growing plant cell walls.3 Xyloglucan metabolism is believed to play important roles in cell definition, cell expansion, and the regulation of plant growth and development.4­8 However, little is known about the structure-function relationship between xyloglucan (or oligoxyloglucans) and its physiological effects, largely due to the difficulty in determining the structure of complex carbohydrates. One approach for determining the detailed structure of complex carbohydrates is to use enzymes, in particular glycosidases. The structures of xyloglucans and oligoxyloglucans were determined using sets of glycosidases with unique substrate specificity. For example, oligoxyloglucan reducing endspecific cellobiohydrolase (OXG-RCBH) from Geotrichum sp. M128 has unique substrate specificity9 and has been successfully used for such purposes.10 The enzyme recognizes specific properties of the reducing end of xyloglucan oligosaccharides, releasing two glucosyl residues from the main chain. This enzyme has at least four subsites (sites -2 to +2) and recognizes a xylose side-chain bound to the third Glc residue from the reducing end (site -1). The enzyme can selectively discriminate between substrates and their analogs. Modifications to the -1 site xylose residue impair substrate function; if the xylosyl sidechain has extra Gal residues, it cannot function as a substrate. Moreover, the reducing end (+2 site) must be free of branching residues. The xylosyl side-chain bound to the Glc residue at the reducing end (site +2) inhibits this activity. With vastly different substrate recognition properties from those of known glycosidases, this enzyme is considered to be unique among glycosidases and has its own EC number (EC 3.2.1.150). OXG-RCBH belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 74 (GH74). We recently reported the 3D structure of OXG-RCBH (PDB code: 1SQJ),11 the first structural determination for GH74. OXG-RCBH is a single subunit enzyme, consisting of two sevenbladed -propeller domains. A large cleft lies between the two domains, with one side of the active site cleft enclosed by a short loop (Gly375­ His385). We believe that this loop prevents the enzyme from binding to the middle of the xyloglucan backbone chain, which could explain the unique exo-activity. Recently, the 3D structure was determined for the homologous GH74 enzyme, Clostridium thermocellum xyloglucanase (Xgh74A), in complex with its substrate.12 Although there are some similarities between their primary and 3D structures (34% amino acid identity and a root mean square distance (RMSD) of 0.19 Å for C atoms of 664 importable residues), Xgh74A uses a different mechanism and hydrolyzes long xyloglucan in endo http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~casy/CAZY/index.html

mode. From a structural perspective, Xgh74A lacks the "loop," and both sides of the active site cleft are open, allowing the enzyme to access the internal site of the xyloglucan chain. It is therefore conceivable that this enzyme has endo-activity. Here, an inactive variant of OXG-RCBH was cocrystallized with a xyloglucan heptasaccharide substrate, XXXG, and the crystal structure was determined. We also constructed a deletion mutant of the loop region, and a detailed analysis of its activity is reported to discuss the role of the loop of OXG-RCBH on substrate specificity and mode of action.

Results and Discussion
The substrate-bound structure of the inactive variant of OXG-RCBH (D465N) Inactive OXG-RCBH (D465N) was co-crystallized with a heptaxyloglucan substrate (XXXG) under conditions similar to the wild-type.13 Crystal growth was optimized using 100 mM Mes buffer (pH 5.2­ 5.3), 5­6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, and 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400 for ten days. The crystal is isomorphous to the wild-type crystal and belongs to the space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 61.0, b = 147.5, c = 212.2 Å. Two protein molecules of the OXG-RCBH mutant exist independently in an asymmetric unit of the crystal. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.4 Å resolution, with an Rmerge of 0.091 and a completeness of 95.1% used for the refinement. After rigid-body refinement and several cycles of iteration of simulated annealing refinement with CNS against the 20­2.4 Å intensity data, the  A-weighted Fo­Fc map was calculated. The  A-weighted Fo­Fc map around the active site located in the central cleft of the molecule showed a distinct density for each molecule in an asymmetric unit, which was large enough to accommodate the XXXG substrate (Figure 1(a)). The model for the substrate was built into the density to construct the model for the enzyme-substrate complex. Further refinement of the complex structure was carried out to obtain final coordinates, with an R-factor of 0.159 and a free R-factor of 0.219. The statistics of data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 1. The complete structure for the OXG-RCBH D465N mutant bound to its XXXG substrate is shown in Figure 1(b). There were no differences in the overall structure between the mutant and the wild-type; each comprised two distinct, yet similar domains (N-domain and C-domain) folded into seven-bladed -propeller structures. Superimposition of the mutant complex onto the wild-type resulted in a RMSD between C atoms of 0.19 Å, revealing no distinct changes to the overall structure on substrate binding. Furthermore, the RMSD for all atoms between the two structures was 0.52 Å, with no large structural differences observed for the sidechain atoms.

The close-up view of the active site and substrate is shown in Figure 1(c). The substrate (XXXG) is bound to the deep cleft region between the N and C-domains. The reducing end of the substrate was aligned to one side of the cleft, which appeared to function as a bottom of the cleft. The bottom of the cleft comprised 11 amino acid residues, Gly375­His385 (shown in red), which formed a loop structure that seemed to prevent the enzyme from binding to the middle of the xyloglucan main chain. Clostridium thermocellum Xgh74A is a GH74 xyloglucanase that lacks the loop region found in OXG-RCBH. Both ends of the active site cleft are fully open to accommodate the middle portion of the xyloglucan main chain.12 The differences in the 3D structures of the enzyme-substrate complex of OXG-RCBH and Xgh74A strongly suggest that the presence or absence of a loop determines the mode of activity, i.e. exo- and endo-activity, respectively. Furthermore, the OXG-RCBH loop covers the space around the C6 position of the reducing end of the Glc residue (+2 site), which clearly explains why +2 Glc needs to be unbranched for its activity. There is also no available space around the C2 position of the Xyl side-chain at the -1 site, accounting for why the Xyl side-chain at the -1 site cannot have an extra Gal residue. The structures of the active sites (around -2 to +2) for OXG-RCBH and Clostridium Xgh74A (PDB code: 2CN3) with substrates are compared in Figure 2. We

previously identified Asp35 and Asp465 as catalytic residues in OXG-RCBH.11 The recent structural analysis of Clostridium Xgh74A in complex with its substrate revealed that Asp70 and Asp480 are the catalytic base and catalytic acid, respectively.12 The positions of Asp35, Asn465 (corresponding to Asp465 in the wild-type enzyme), and the main chain of the substrate were easily superposable with their corresponding residues on Clostridium Xgh74A. This indicates that Asp35 is the catalytic base and Asp465 is the catalytic acid for OXG-RCBH. The schematic representation of the interaction between the OXG-RCBH D465N mutant with its substrate XXXG is shown in Figure 3. The hydrolysis site of the -1,4 bond between positions -1 and +1 of the main chain of the substrate is located between the catalytic base, Asp35, and the catalytic acid, Asp465 (substituted with Asn in this mutant enzyme). The side-chain of the catalytic acid, Asn465, forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom at the hydrolysis site. The catalytic base, Asp35, sequesters a water molecule 3.4 Å from the C1 atom of -1 Glc, which corresponds to an anomeric carbon of the product tetrasaccharide XX. This water molecule seems to act as the nucleophile in the glycoside hydrolysis of this enzyme using an inversion mechanism.14 The similarity between OXG-RCBH and Xgh74A with substrates bound within their active site clefts is shown in Figure 2. The majority of residues that interact and undergo the catalytic reaction with the main chain of the substrates occupy very similar positions. The RMSD between the C of corresponding residues (Asp35, Asn116, Arg120, Trp395, Gly415, Asn465 (Asp for the wild-type), and Asn753 for OXGRCBH, and Ala70 (Asp for the wild-type), Asn154, Arg158, Trp410, Gly430, Asp480, and Asn749 for Xgh74A) was 0.29 Å on superposition. Conceivably, these two enzymes could bind to the backbone of the -1,4-glucan in a similar manner, despite maintaining a different mode of hydrolysis. Several differences were observed in the residues that interact with the side-chains of the substrate (the interaction between OXG-RCBH and XXXG is shown in Figure 3). One difference can be found at the -1 site. Asp488 of OXG-RCBH interacts with the Xyl side-chain at the -1 site, which is required for the catalytic activity described above. Another difference is observed around the +2 site of the substrate. Clostridium Xgh74A recognizes the Xyl residue at +2 by stacking interaction of Trp395,12 while Gly382 and Ala383 lie in the loop region of OXG-RCBH and interact with Glc residue at +2. The main chain amide nitrogen of Gly382 interacts with the oxygen of the pyranose ring of +2 Glc, and the amide nitrogen of the adjacent Ala383 forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl oxygen at the C6 position of +2 Glc. Furthermore, the side-chain of Asp318 is located within hydrogen-bonding distance to the hydroxyl oxygen at the C1 position of +2 Glc. In addition to these hydrogen bonds between the substrate and active cleft residues, two stacking interactions were observed between

Trp395 with +2 Glc and Trp396 with +1 Glc. These residues play an integral role in the recognition of the reducing end of the substrate oligoxyloglucan. One of the unique properties of OXG-RCBH is the release of two glucose residues from the main chain at the reducing end. Underlying this activity is the ability to recognize the two glucose segments (+1 and +2) at the reducing end. These two stacking interactions and several hydrogen bonds with the reducing end of the +2 site seem to play a crucial role in this activity. We elucidated a structural basis for the unique substrate specificity in OXG-RCBH. Directed evolution of OXG-RCBH for soluble expression in Escherichia coli The wild-type OXG-RCBH is highly susceptible to forming insoluble inclusion bodies when overexpressed in E. coli. This undesirable property presented limitations to our protein engineering experiment. We attempted to produce loop-deleted variants to assess the role of the loop region on the mode of action. However, we could not refold the inclusion bodies using the same procedure as the

wild-type when the loop was deleted from the wildtype sequence. Therefore, we tried to fold the enzyme in E. coli before deleting the loop. Applying rational approaches for protein folding is one of the most difficult challenges in protein engineering; we therefore used a directed evolution technique. Random mutagenesis was first carried out by error-prone PCR, and the library was screened for activity using a soluble fraction of the cell lysate to identify two positive clones (1-1D3, 1-0D3). The clones were then subjected to DNA shuffling, and the library was screened for activity. The three most active clones were identified (2-2E1, 2-10A1, and 210F1), and after re-shuffling, the 3-1D12 variant was obtained by screening (Figure 4). This transformant produced a large amount of soluble recombinant OXG-RCBH visible by SDS-PAGE (Figure 5). The enzymatic properties (pH and temperature effect, specific activity, and substrate specificity) were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type, indicating that the mutations only affected the solubility of the enzyme. DNA sequencing revealed that 3-1D12 contained eight nucleotide substitutions, four of which were non-synonymous mutations. Among them, T26I, T523S, and N764D were

located on the molecular surface, while V136I was buried deep within the molecule. It is not certain why these mutations increased solubility. The evolved 3-1D12 OXG-RCBH gene was then introduced into pET28-a(+) with a 6x-His-tag fused at the N terminus. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli Rosseta-gami 2 (DE3) cells, which have extra copies of tRNA genes for rare E. coli codons and co-promote disulfide bond formation to increase protein solubility. Approximately 10 mg of recombinant OXG-RCBH were obtained from 3 l of culture. Activity of the loop mutant A loop mutant (deletion mutant of the loop region, Gly375­His385) was constructed and the activity was analyzed. When XXXG was used as a substrate, both the loop and 3-1D12 variants

produced XX and XG, although the hydrolytic activity of the loop variant was lower than 31D12. The Michaelis constant (Km) and the specific activity toward XXXGol (reduced XXXG) of 3-1D12 was 6.6 mM and 15.2 units/mg enzyme, and the corresponding values were 25.1 mM and 0.8 units/ mg enzyme for the loop, respectively. There were significant differences in affinity and turnover number for short oligosaccharide substrates. The wild-type OXG-RCBH could not cleave polymeric tamarind seed xyloglucan (TXG) as a substrate. OXG-RCBH recognizes the xylose sidechains at the -1 site, while the +2 glucose is not thought to be branched. Once the substrate is cleaved, the newly generated reducing end (-1 site before the cleavage) is a branched glucose. This structure cannot serve as a substrate, and the reaction terminates at this stage. Alternatively, the loop hydrolyzed TXG (Km and specific activity are

59 tion products were analyzed by gel-filtration column chromatography. TXG was incubated with loop enzyme, and aliquots of the sample were removed at various intervals and applied to the column (Figure 7). The molecular mass rapidly decreased from the initial stages of the reaction, suggesting the occurrence of random -1,4-linkage hydrolysis along the whole chain. When these results are considered collectively, the loop enzyme seems to resemble a typical endo-type enzyme. The main products after 6 and 16 h seemed to differ from XXXGXXXG and XXXG. The main peaks were fractionated and the compositions were analyzed. There were various structures of oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization from 7 to 14. It was difficult to identify their fine structures because of their complex structures and high structural diversity.

Viscosimetric assays were performed by monitoring the flow time of 0.8% TXG. The specific viscosity was determined along with the reducing power at various intervals (Figure 6). The degradation of TXG was concomitant with a decrease in viscosity, indicating that the loop variant acquired endoglucanase activity. Degrada-

60 The enzyme substrate specificity to the tetradecasaccharide, XXXGXXXG, was analyzed. Wild-type OXG-RCBH generates XXXGXX and XG (Figure 8(a)) due to its strict specificity. By contrast, loop cleaved XXXGXXXG to produce XG, XX, GXX, XXX, and XGXX, with the proposed cleavage sites shown by arrows in Figure 8(b). The loop mutant enzyme was less selective, cleaving the glycosidic bond between XX and XGXXXG, XXX and GXXXG, and XXXGXX and XG. GXXXG and XGXXXG were not observed as final products, probably because they were further cleaved to GXX and XG, and XGXX and XG, respectively. The products of the reaction, XXXGXX and XG, were identical to that of the wild-type. The formation of products XX and XGXXXG is also possible when considering the newly developed endo-activity, in addition to the enzyme's ability to bind to the middle of the main chain (the structure of four subsites (-2 to +2) is "XXXG"). Interestingly, this mutant also cleaved between XXX and GXXXG. The structure of four subsites (-2 to +2) is "XXGX". The -1 site of this reaction is branched, as is the +2 site for this reaction. As previously mentioned, wild-type OXG-RCBH recognizes the xylose side-chain at the -1 site. The Xyl side-chain at the +2 site inhibits enzymatic activity due to steric hindrances between the sidechain and the loop. Deleting the loop should eliminate this steric hindrance. The novel cleavage sites of the loop variant are consistent with this notion.

Conclusion
We reported the structure of OXG-RCBH bound to its substrate (XXXG). The molecular basis for the unique substrate specificity and the mode of action were fully described. The reducing end of the substrate was oriented to one side of the active site cleft with a loop, allowing the enzyme to work in an exo-manner. Based on this knowledge, the structure-guided conversion of the mode of action and substrate specificity were achieved. The loopdeleted enzyme (loop) could function as an endoenzyme, and as a consequence, substrate specificity was lost. These results clearly demonstrate that this loop region contributes to the unique enzymatic activity of OXG-RCBH.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization The hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method28 was applied at 20 °C for the crystallization of the inactive OXG-RCBH mutant, D465N,11 at a concentration of 0.129 mM, mixed with twofold molar heptasaccharide substrate XXXG (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) and incubated for 12 h. Several crystallization conditions were screened, with the crystal of wild-type OXG-RCBH in 100 mM Mes buffer (pH 5.8­5.9), 4­5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, and 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 40013 as initial conditions and further optimized by adjusting the pH and concentration of PEGs. Data collection and structure refinement Before collecting the X-ray diffraction data, the crystal was mounted in a CryoLoop (Hampton Research) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data for crystals of the mutant, D465N, bound to substrate were collected at 100 K on beamline BL44B2 at the SPring-8, Japan, using an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector with 1.0000 Å radiation and were processed with HKL200015 and the CCP4 program suit.29 A randomly selected portion of the diffraction data (5.0%) was used to calculate the free Rfactor.16 The structure was refined with CNS17 and REFMAC518 using the structure of wild-type OXGRCBH (PDB code: 1SQJ)11 as an initial structure. The programs XtalView19 and COOT20 were used to display and correct the structure. Directed evolution of OXG-RCBH for soluble expression in E. coli The OXG-RCBH expression plasmid was constructed by cloning the mature region of the cDNA into pET29-a(+) (Novagen).9 Error-prone PCR of OXG-RCBH was carried out using a GeneMorph random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DNA shuffling was carried out by the StEP DNA recombination method.21 In both cases, the mutated gene fragments were cloned back into the expression plasmid by the MEGAWHOP method.22 Competent E. coli BL21CodonPlus (DE3) RP cells were transformed to yield mutant libraries.

Structural Basis for the Exo-activity in OXG-RCBH For screening, cells were first grown on LB agar plates containing 30 g/ml kanamycin. Colonies were selected and cultured in a 96-deep-well plate filled with LB medium containing 30 g/ml kanamycin and 50 g/ml chloramphenicol. Expression was induced by addition of isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration of 0.1 mM) for 16 h at 20 °C. A portion of the culture (90 l) was transferred to a new 96-well plate, followed by the addition of 10 l of 10x-BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to a new plate. OXG-RCBH activity was determined using reduced XXXG (XXXGol) substrate, which was obtained through borohydride reduction of the reducing end of XXXG.23 The supernatant was incubated with 0.5% (w/v) XXXGol in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) at 37 °C. The resulting reducing power of the newly generated reducing end was determined using a DNS method.24 After three rounds of directed evolution, 3-1D12 was obtained. The gene was subcloned into pET28-a(+) to fuse a 6x-His-tag at the N terminus, and expressed in E. coli Rosetta-gami2 (DE3) (Novagen). The recombinant protein was extracted using the BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The soluble fraction was dialyzed against 25 mM imidazoleHCl buffer (pH 7.4), loaded onto a HiTrap DEAE FF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mM imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl for 20 min. The recombinant protein was further purified with a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of the deletion mutant of the loop region A deletion mutant of the loop region, Gly375­His385 (the loop mutant) was constructed following the Quik change (Stratagene) procedure using the primers 5CGTGGCTCGACTTCAACAACGGTACGCCCGGCCTCACCAA-3 and 5-TTGGTGAGGCCGGGCGTACCGTTGTTGAAGTCGAGCCACG-3, and pET28 OXGRCBH expression vector (derived from the 3-1D12 clone) as a template. E. coli Rosseta-gami 2 (DE3) was transformed, and the recombinant protein was purified with a HiTrap DEAE FF column and a HiTrap chelating column. Analysis of kinetic parameters The kinetic parameters were determined at various concentrations of the substrate, XXXGol or TXG purchased from Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Osaka, Japan (Glyloid 3S; the average molecular weight is approximately 470,000), in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 45 °C. The bicinchoninate assay25 was used to quantify reducing sugars. The Michaelis constant (Km) and specific activity were calculated from the plot of initial reaction rates versus substrate concentration using Prism (GraphPad software). Analysis of the mode of action To elucidate the enzyme's mode of action, a viscosimetric assay and gel-filtration column chromatography were performed using previously reported methods.26 The viscosimetric assay was carried out by monitoring the flow-time of 0.8% TXG in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), incubated with the enzyme at different times.

The flow-time of the reaction mixture was determined in an Ostwald viscometer at room temperature, and the reducing-sugar content was determined by a bicinchoninate assay. At various intervals, the specific viscosity was calculated as (T­T0)/T0, where T0 is the flow-time measured for the buffer, and T is the flow-time of the reaction mixture with the enzyme. Gel-filtration chromatography was performed to analyze the xyloglucan hydrolysis products. TXG (0.8%) in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) was incubated with enzyme. At intervals, the reaction solution was applied to a Superdex Peptide 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences) gel-filtration column. Analysis of substrate specificity Substrate specificity was analyzed using xyloglucan tetradecasaccharide, XXXGXXXG, prepared as described.27 Oligosaccharide (0.2 mg) was incubated with enzymes in 20 l of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 45 °C. The resulting products were analyzed by normalphase HPLC. HPLC was carried out with an Amide-80 normal-phase column (4.6 mm × 250 mm; TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) using 60% acetonitrile (isocratic) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Protein Data Bank accession code The coordinates for the OXG-RCBH D465N mutant complexed with xyloglucan heptasaccharide, XXXG, have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank and are available under accession code 2EBS.
