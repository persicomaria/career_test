Abstract The 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase catalyses the sixth step of the shikimate pathway that is responsible for synthesizing aromatic compounds and is absent in mammals, which makes it a potential target for drugs development against microbial diseases. Here, we report the phosphate binding effects at the structure of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This enzyme is formed by two similar domains that close on each other induced by ligand binding, showing the occurrence of a large conformation change. We have monitored the phosphate binding effects using analytical ultracentrifugation, small angle X-ray scattering and, circular dichroism techniques. The low resolution results showed that the enzyme in the presence of phosphate clearly presented a more compact structure. Thermal-induced unfolding experiments followed by circular dichroism suggested that phosphate rigidified the enzyme. Summarizing, these data suggested that the phosphate itself is able to induce conformational change resulting in the closure movement in the M. tuberculosis 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase.

erythrose 4-phosphate are converted into chorismic acid [4,5]. Chorismic acid is the common precursor for the synthesis of aromatic compounds, such as aromatic amino acids, pholate and ubiquinone, among others. The importance of shikimate pathway can be exemplified by observing that the deletion of the aroA gene, which codes 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, attenuates the virulence of Streptomyces pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica strains [6,7]. Another example that shows the importance of the shikimate pathway is that the EPSPS is the site of action of the N-[phosphomethyl]glycine, also known as glyphosate (GLP). It is the broad-spectrum active-compound of the non-selective herbicide RoundUp [8]. EPSPS is the sixth enzyme in the shikimate pathway, transferring the enolpyruvyl group from PEP to shikimate 3-phosphate (S3P) in order to form 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) and phosphate (Pi) [3,8,9]. The reaction depends on the order of substrate binding, which S3P binds first, followed by PEP, then releasing EPSP and Pi. The EPSPS reaction mechanism seems to involve a tetrahedral intermediary [9,10] that would be mimicked by the GLP compound [9]. The EPSPS crystallographic structures either free or bound to ligands (S3P, PEP analogues, and GLP­PDB access codes: 1Q36 [9]; 1RF4, 1RF5, and 1RF6 [10]; 1G6S and 1G6T [11]; 1EPS [12]; 1MI4 [13]), show that the enzyme suffered an extensive conformation change, which leads it to a closed state [9­13]. The EcEPSPS and SpEPSPS crystallographic structures show that the EPSPS closing, induced by ligands, occurs by a twist of one domain in relation to another, which imbeds the ligands between the domains and increases the enzyme rigidity [10,11]. Data from EPSPS in solution also points out this closing mechanism [14,15]. The EPSPSs are formed by two similar domains that possess six motifs for secondary structure type bababb. These motifs are arranged so that their electronegative macrodipoles in the domain interface generate an attraction for anionic ligands [8,10,12]. The inhibitor GLP would compete with PEP for the binding site [11], but it also seems to involve an allosteric component, as suggested by Sikorski and Gruys [16] and Du et al. [17]. Despite the high conservation on the secondary/tertiary structure [9­13], EPSPS proteins present low conservation on the amino acid sequence which would imply in differences on the action mechanism and/or affinity for ligands [10]. Our group has dedicated efforts to study the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS--EC 2.5.1.19) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtEPSPS), which resulted in the enzyme production and activity characterization [18,19], including the protein structure modeling [20]. We have been studying the ligand effects on the MtEPSPS structure by low resolution techniques, like analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and, circular dichroism (CD), aiming to improve the overall knowledge about MtEPSPS. Here, we report MtEPSPS studies in equilibrium conditions with Pi, an EPSPS reaction product, which binds weakly to

EPSPS complexes [14]. Our results suggested that MtEPSPS, in the presence of Pi, was in its closed conformation, and it was in the open state in the absence of Pi. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that Pi alone fixes an EPSPS in the closed conformation. Materials and methods Protein sample The active recombinant MtEPSPS was expressed and purified as previously described [18,19]. The pellet from this protein saturated with ammonium sulphate 80% was resolubilized and dialyzed exhaustively against either Tris­HCl 50 mM (pH 7.6) or sodium/potassium phosphate (Na/K Pi) 100 mM (pH 6.8) buffers. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using the calculated extinction coefficient for native conditions or for denatured proteins [21]. Hydrodynamic characterization The diffusion coefficients (D) were obtained by dynamic light scattering using a DynaPro-MS/X device (Protein Solutions) at 20 °C and in the two MtEPSPS conditions described above. The software Sednterp (www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm) was used to estimate the following MtEPSPS properties: partial specific volume (Vbar = 0.7361 mL/g), the buffers viscosity (gNa/K Pi = 1.0474 · 10À2 poise and gTris­HCl = 1.0167 · 10À2 poise), density (qNa/K Pi = 1.01263 g/mL and qTris­ HCl = 0.99966 g/mL), and Dsphere for a globular protein of about 46 kDa. The HydroPro software [22] was applied to estimate the standard diffusion coefficient (D20,w) and the maximum distance (Dmax) from the MtEPSPS models previously developed [20]. AUC experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The MtEPSPS was tested in concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 lg/mL in either Tris­HCl or Na/K Pi buffers. The sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 20 °C, 40,000 rpm (AN-60Ti rotor), and the scan data acquisition was taken at 225 nm. The software SedFit (Version 9.3) was used in order to fit the absorbance versus cell radius data. This software solves the Lamm equation so as to discriminate the spreading of the sedimentation boundary from diffusion [23,24]. Thus, we used the D estimated by the dynamic light scattering experiments to calculate the high resolution sedimentation coefficient distributions c (s). The maximum of Gaussian curves of the c (s) resulted in the apparent sedimentation coefficient s*. The ratio of the sedimentation coefficient (s) to diffusion coefficient (s/D ratio) gives the molecular mass as indicated by Eq. (1): M¼ sRT Dð1 À V bar qÞ ð1Þ

where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The Sednterp software was used to estimate the standard sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) at each protein concentration from the s* in order to calculate, by extrapolation, the s0 , at 0 mg/mL of protein concentration. 20;w This procedure minimizes interferences caused by temperature, viscosity, and molecular crowd [25]. The HydroPro software [22] was applied to estimate the s20,w from the MtEPSPS models [20]. Circular dichroism spectroscopy Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with the temperature controlled by a Peltier-type control system PFD 425S. The MtEPSPS protein was tested in either Tris­HCl or Na/K Pi buffers at final concentrations of 200­2000 lg/mL. The spectra were collected at a scanning rate of 100 nm/min with a spectral band width of 1 nm and using a 0.1 mm pathlength cell. The resultant spectra were normalized to residual molar ellipticity ([H]) and the software CDNN Deconvolution [26] was used for estimating the MtEPSPS secondary structure content. The thermal-induced unfolding experiments followed by CD were performed at a temperature rate of 1 °C/min and a protein concentration of 200 lg/mL in the conditions above described, using a 1 mm pathlength cell. The average of three unfolding curves was used to build the MtEPSPS thermal-unfold profile, and the temperature at the midpoint of each unfolding transition (Tm) was determined by fitting with Gaussians curves (one or two) of the first derivative function. SAXS studies X-ray scattering data were collected at room temperature using CuKa X-rays radiation generated by a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA and collimated with a block slit system [27]. The scattering intensity was measured using a linear position sensitive detector (CBPF-Brazil). The SAXS measurements were performed within an angular range defined by ° ° 0.02 AÀ1 < h < 0.450 AÀ1: h = (4p sin 2h)/k, 2h is the angle between the incident and the scattered X-ray beam, and k is the X-ray wavelength. The contributions to the scattering intensity from the solvent, capillary, and air were subtracted from the total intensity. MtEPSPS SAXS measurements were carried out at a concentration of 12 mg/mL in Na/K Pi buffer and also in Tris­HCl buffer. The measurement time was of 12 h. The experimental SAXS intensity function was desmeared to suppress the influence from the slit collimation system yielding the corrected intensities, i (h). A structural parameter related to the overall size of macromolecules, the radius of gyration (Rg), was determined by the Guinier equation [28]: " 2 # Àh R2 g IðhÞ ¼ Ið0Þe ð2Þ 3

This equation applies to macromolecules in the limits of a diluted solution and small h values. More detailed information of the molecular structure can be obtained from the distance distribution function (p (r)), which is related to the SAXS intensity i (h) by: Z 1 1 ðrhÞIðhÞsenðrhÞdh ð3Þ pðrÞ ¼ 2 2p 0 The p (r) curve is proportional to the number of pairs of electrons separated by the distance r, which is encountered by combinations between all the elements of the macromolecule. The Rg of macromolecules in solution is usually determined by applying Eq. (2) or alternatively through p (r) function using the Eq. (4). R1 pðrÞr2 dr 2 Rg ¼ 0R 1 ð4Þ 2 0 pðrÞdr The experimental distance distribution function, p (r)exp, has been determined by indirect Fourier transformation using the ITP program [27]. This software was also employed to determine the intensity i (h), which was free from smearing collimation effects. The theoretical p (r)theo function of the protein models was calculated by the program MULTIBODY [27], modified in order to make molecular model building easier [29]. The program MULTIBODY calculates the resulting function p (r) of the complete set of atomic coordinates of each structural model for the macromolecule. In the present study we calculated the p (r)theo for the open and the closed MtEPSPS models previously developed [20]. To assess the correlation between theoretical and experimental distance distribution function p (r)exp and p (r)theo, respectively, we have calculated the linear correlation coefficient (CC) [30], as previously showed by De Azevedo et al. [31]. Briefly, when a correlation is known to be significant, CC is a conventional way of summarizing its strength. The shape, which generates the highest CC, is considered the greatest macromolecular conformation. Results and discussion MtEPSPS shares, in the amino acid sequence, 30% and 20% of identity with the enzymes from Escherichia coli and S. pneumoniae, respectively, which have their crystallographic structures available from PDB (1Q36 [9]; 1RF4, 1RF5, and 1RF6 [10]; 1G6S and 1G6T [11]; 1EPS [12]; 1MI4 [13]). This low conservation would imply differences on the action and regulation mechanism for the MtEPSPS in comparison to the other enzymes. For instance, differences in the affinity from a range of 10­200 times between EPSPS and GLP on several organisms have been reported [32]. Slight differences on the closing mechanism have also been reported: the twist of one domain against another, in the EcEPSPS, is of about 65°, whereas it is around 30° in the SpEPSPS [10]. These data justify the necessity of the evaluation of the ligand biding effects on EPSPS from

several sources in order to determinate their action mechanism, which may be helpful on future inhibitor development. In this report, we present results of the effect of Pi on the MtEPSPS structure, which is an EPSPS reaction product [16] and is able to induce conformational changes on the EcEPSPS structure [14]. For this study we used MtEPSPS samples prepared by exhaustive dialysis in both presence of Pi dianion (Na/K Pi buffer) and in its absence (Tris­HCl buffer). Sample quality First, in order to verify the quality of our MtEPSPS sample in the two conditions, the Tris­HCl and in the Na/K Pi buffers, we performed dynamic light scattering experiment in protein concentration ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 mg/mL. The MtEPSPS samples behaved as a monodispersive solution in either Tris­HCl or in Na/K Pi buffers, and the D20,w estimated for the protein was of about 7.1 and 7.6 · 10À7 cm2/seg, respectively. These results were similar to those values calculated by the HydroPro software to open and closed MtEPSPS models (Table 1). The D20,w values obtained are in accordance with particles presenting molecular mass of around 50­60 kDa. The CD technique was used in order to characterize the MtEPSPS secondary structure content in the Tris­HCl buffer and also in the Na/K Pi buffer. Fig. 1 represents the MtEPSPS CD spectra in both conditions, showing that they were similar and that the protein presented a-helices as its main secondary structure content. These data were consistent with the CD spectra for the SpEPSPS, showing that the presence of several ligands does not change the CD spectra [17]. The secondary structure content estimated by the CDNN Deconvolution software [26] in the two conditions was: 32% in a-helix, 19% in b-sheet, 17% in turns, and 31% in coils (error was less than 5%). The EcEPSPS and SpEPSPS crystallographic structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank have similar secondary structure content: 30% in a-helix and 23% in b-sheet (PDB access codes: 1Q36 [9]; 1RF4, 1RF5 and 1RF6 [10]; 1G6S and 1G6T [11]; 1MI4 [13]). The secondary structure content of the MtEPSPS models [20] were analyzed by the Procheck software [33], and estimated at 31% in a-helix and 25% in bsheet, showing a similar result to the experimental data. Altogether, the dynamic light scattering and CD experi-

The amount of secondary structures to MtEPSPS were calculated by CDNN Deconvolution software and the results was: 32% in a-helix, 19% in b-sheet, 17% in turns, and 31% in coils (error was less than 5%).

ments attested the MtEPSPS structural integrity and quality in both Tris­HCl and in Na/K Pi buffers. AUC experiments Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in the presence and the absence of Pi (Na/K Pi and Tris­ HCl buffer, respectively), in order to obtain information about the shape of the MtEPSPS. Fig. 2 shows the sedimentation coefficient distribution c (s) of the MtEPSPS in the two conditions, where the maximum of the Gaussian curves gives the s*. In order to avoid interferences caused by the solution viscosity and molecular crowd [25], we determined the s0 (Fig. 2, inset and Table 1). The results 20;w of the sedimentation velocity experiments showed that the MtEPSPS samples behaved as a monodispersive solution and that the molecular mass estimated by the ratio of the s/D (Eq. (1)) was of around 44 ± 1 kDa in either buffers. This value is nearly of the calculated from the MtEPSPS amino acid sequence, showing that the MtEPSPS was monomeric in the conditions tested. The s0 20;w estimated for the MtEPSPS, as the one estimated for the D20,w, (Table 1) evidenced that the protein presented an asymmet-

Fig. 2. AUC experiments show that MtEPSPS was more globular in the presence of Pi than in its absence. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 20 °C, with rotor (AN-60Ti) at the velocity of 40,000 rpm. The figure displays experiments with 50 lg/mL of the MtEPSPS in both Tris­HCl and Na/K Pi buffers. The c (s) distributions were fitted using the SedFit software [23,24] and the maximum of Gaussian curves resulted in the apparent sedimentation coefficient s*.

ric shape. Both the ssphere and Dsphere for a spherical particle of 46,426 Da (MtEPSPS' molecular mass) were estimated by the software Sednterp at about 4.5 S and 8.9 · 10À7 cm2/seg, consecutively. These data suggest that the MtEPSPS had a frictional ratio of about 1.3 (data not shown). The AUC results also showed that the s0 was slightly 20;w different in the presence of Pi when compared in its absence. In the Na/K Pi buffer, the MtEPSPS presented a s0 higher than in the Tris­HCl buffer: 3.48 ± 0.05 S ver20;w sus 3.32 ± 0.01 S, respectively. These values were in agreement with the ones estimated by the HydroPro software for the MtEPSPS models in either open or closed conformation (Table 1). Thus, these data suggested that the MtEPSPS in presence of Pi ions was more globular or compact than in its absence, suggesting that the enzyme in presence of Pi was in the closed state (see below). SAXS experiments Fig. 3A shows the i (h) curves derived from SAXS experiments for the MtEPSPS in two buffer conditions, suggesting differences in the scattering particle. These differences may be best verified by the evaluation of the Rg, obtained from the Guinier plot (Fig. 3B), which is a fine tool to observe overall conformation changes on the molecule structure [34]. The Rg for the MtEPSPS in the presence ° of Pi was of 22.2 ± 0.6 A and in its absence was of ° . These data suggested that MtEPSPS has dis23.8 ± 0.7 A

tinct structures in those different chemical conditions. An overall reduction of the Rg of the EcEPSPS is observed after the S3P and GLP binding, as had been examined by SAXS [35]. The p (r) curves represent the same information contained in the i (h) curves (Fig. 3A), but p (r) curves possess a more discernable representation, supplying information about the size (Dmax) and shape of the scattering particle from the direct inspection of its curve [34]. Figs. 4A and 5A show the p (r)exp curves from the MtEPSPS in the Na/K Pi and Tris­HCl buffers, respectively. It is also possible to estimate the Rg from the p (r) (see Materials and methods), and the values obtained for MtEPSPS were similar to those determined by application of the Guinier plot (Table 1). These data were in accordance with our experimental results from AUC experiments, suggesting that Pi binding is responsible for changes on the MtEPSPS structure.

Fig. 4. MtEPSPS distance distribution function in Na/K Pi buffer. (A) The p (r)exp curve of the MtEPSPS in Na/K Pi buffer was calculated by indirect Fourier transformation using the ITP program. The p (r)theo from the MtEPSPS closed model (represented in (B)), was calculated using the program MULTIBODY. The discrepancy between the p (r)exp and p (r)theo, given by the CC value, was of about 0.9954, showing the good correlation of these two curves and suggesting that in the presence o Pi ions, the MtEPSPS is in its closed conformation. The Rg and Dmax of these curves are presented in Table 1.

Fig. 5. MtEPSPS distance distribution function in Tris­HCl buffer. (A) The p (r)exp curve of the MtEPSPS in Tris­HCl buffer was calculated by indirect Fourier transformation using the ITP program. The p (r)theo from the MtEPSPS open model (represented in (B)--attention for the cleft between the two domains), was calculated using the program MULTIBODY. The discrepancy between the p (r)exp and p (r)theo, give by the CC value, was of about 0.9653. Despite some parts of the p (r)exp and p (r)theo not showing a good fitting, there are a good correlation between the Rg and Dmax of both curves (Table 1), indicating that they present some resemblance (see Results and discussion for details).

The p (r)theo curves were plotted for the MtEPSPS closed and open models, and are also showed in Figs. 4A and 5A, respectively. These models are demonstrated, for comparison, in Figs. 4B and 5B, respectively. The correlation coefficient CC between the p (r)exp and p (r)theo, as well as the values of the Rg and Dmax (Table 1) estimated by the HydroPro software for the MtEPSPS closed and open models, demonstrate that they are similar to those experimentally determined (see below). On the whole, the data suggested that the MtEPSPS closed and open models are high-quality models for this protein in solution, either in presence of Pi or in its absence, respectively. Fig. 4A shows that the closed model fits well the experimental SAXS data in the presence of Pi, presenting a CC of about 0.9954 (Table 1). However, the MtEPSPS open model did not fit quite well to the p (r)exp obtained from SAXS in Tris­HCl buffer (Fig. 5A), although the Rg and Dmax were indeed in agreement (Table 1). Fig. 5A suggests that the p (r)theo from the MtEPSPS open model presents a shape that resembles a particle that

would be formed by a well-separated subunits or lobules, like a halter [34]. However, the p (r)exp from the MtEPSPS in Tris­HCl resembled a prolate asymmetric protein, in which no clear globules were observed [34]. The explanation for this `apparent contradiction' may be the flexibility and dynamics of the MtEPSPS in the open conformation. Some authors have reported that the EPSPSs from other organisms are flexible and that their rigidity increase in the presence of ligands [10,11,15]. On the other hand, it is worth to mention that the SAXS technique supplies information about a ``time averaged conformation'', indicating the main conformation presented by the scattering particle [34]. Therefore, the discrepancy between the p (r)exp of the MtEPSPS in the Tris­HCl buffer and the p (r)theo of the open model would suggest that its dynamic conformational equilibrium was dislocated to the open conformation. Moreover, the presence of Pi changed the MtEPSPS conformation toward the closed state.

Thermal-unfolding experiments Fig. 6 (upper panel) represents the thermal-induced unfolding experiments followed by CD. These data suggested that the MtEPSPS initiated its thermal unfolding after 40 °C and that it was influenced by the buffer composition: the unfolding curve in the presence of Pi dianion occurred at higher temperatures than in its absence. The MtEPSPS in the presence of Pi unfolded with a Tm at 56.4 °C, while in the Tris­HCl buffer it unfolded at 53.8 °C (Table 2). Analyzing the profile of the first derivative function of the MtEPSPS thermal-induced unfolding curve (Fig. 6 ­ lower panel), we can notice shoulders in the curves, which interfered in their fitting by using one

Gaussian function only (data not shown). Considering that the EPSPSs possess two domains of similar sizes and foldings [8,10,12], it would be expected alike thermal stability, as we observed for MtEPSPS. Fitting the first derivative curves with two Gaussian system (data not shown); we can observe two close Tms (Table 2). In the presence of Na/K Pi buffer, the Tms estimated for both domains were 2-3 °C higher than the ones observed in the Tris­HCl buffer (Table 2). These data suggested that in the presence of Pi the MtEPSPS presents more thermal stability than in its absence, which may be a consequence of an increased rigidity; as described for the closed conformation from EPSPSs in the presence of ligands [10,11,15]. Considering the two Tms above described, we can conclude that the two MtEPSPS domains were influenced by the presence of the Pi, suggesting an interaction of the dianion with both domains. Thus, the Pi binding site is possibly in the cleft between the domains. In all conditions tested, the MtEPSPS thermal-unfolding was irreversible. MtEPSPS conformation remarks In the previous sections, we presented results that attested the quality of the MtEPSPS samples, showing that they were monomeric. They possessed an asymmetric shape, and the a-helix as its main secondary structure content. All these data are in accordance with the current knowledge about the EPSPS structure [9­13]. In either conditions tested, MtEPSPS CD spectra were very similar to each other, suggesting that the conformational changes observed by AUC, SAXS, and thermal-induced unfolding experiments were mainly in the tertiary structure level. In fact, the superposition of the EPSPS domains in open and closed conformation showed that they possess similar secondary structure content (data not shown). In this report, we used three independent tools in order to monitor the MtEPSPS structure and the conformational change induced by Pi. The AUC is able to provide information about hydrodynamics properties of proteins and their shape in solution [25]. SAXS technique supplies data about the protein structure at low resolution in solution as well [34]. Thermal unfolding followed by CD may supply data about the thermodynamic interactions between proteins and ligands. Altogether, the AUC, SAXS, and thermal-unfolding results presented here suggested that in the presence of Pi, MtEPSPS was in a more compact form than in the absence of this dianion. Such compacted structure resembled EPSPS in the closed state, as previously determined by crystallographic studies in the presence of ligands (PDB access codes: 1Q36 [9]; 1RF4 and 1RF6 [10]; 1G6S and 1G6T [11]; 1MI4 [13]). Schonbrunn et al. [11] awoke to the sequence of ligands ¨ binding in which the first S3P binds to EcEPSPS and that S3P itself would be able to close the enzyme. However, Alibhai and Stallings [8] suggest that another ligand might be important to the full EPSPS closure. Therefore, the Pi dianion and the formate ion should be considered, since

Fig. 6. MtEPSPS thermal-induced unfolding experiments. MtEPSPS (200 lg/mL) in the Tris­HCl or Na/K Pi buffer were submitted to a thermal-unfolding followed by CD at 222 nm. The unfolding experiments (in triplicate) were measured from 20 to 80 °C, irreversible though, showing a precipitation after the temperature decrease. The upper panel represents the three unfolding experiments average. The lower panel represents the first derivative of the temperature-unfolding curve that was used to be fitted by Gaussian curves, where the maximum of Gaussian curves resulted in the Tm (Table 2). The Tm was determined for each curve and represents the average of the three thermal-unfolding curves from fitting with 1, and 2 Gaussian systems (see text for details).

they have been found in the EcEPSPS­S3P complex structure; occupying the GLP binding site (PDB access code 1G6T - [11]). These data suggest that Pi may be important for the full closure of the EPSPS­S3P complex. Moreover, thermodynamic and mass spectrometry data reports describe that S3P by itself is unable to induce the complete EPSPS closure. Thus, another ligand is needed, like PEP or GLP, to induce the full conformation change effect on the EPSPS structure [14,15,17]. That means the participation of many other ligands may be important for inducing full EPSPSs conformational changes, including Pi. Park et al. [10] propose that the EPSPS domains, in the unbound state, present a ``dynamic motion'' that is in equilibrium between the open and closed conformations. Our SAXS results for MtEPSPS in the Tris­HCl buffer, presented agreement with the Rg and Dmax of the MtEPSPS open model, but disagreed between the p (r)theo and the p (r)exp curves. This discrepancy would be according to the ``dynamic motion'' hypothesis above described, since SAXS data represent an average data time that shows the main conformation of the scattering particle [34]. Park et al. [10] suggests that S3P binding to EPSPS should disturb the equilibrium toward an incomplete closed conformation, when should be fully closed after the PEP or GLP binding. Additionally, the closure motion would imply an increment of the relative protein stability [10]. Regarding all these propositions, our results suggest that Pi should bind in the cleft and can shift the MtEPSPS equilibrium toward a closed form, reducing its Rg, and making it more globular and increasing its thermal stability. The SpEPSPS structure possesses a `reversible gate' or channel on its structure that should allow the PEP (or GLP) entering to the binding site in the SpEPSPS­S3P complex incompletely closed [10]. The PEP (or GLP) binding should be the ligand responsible for inducing the complete EPSPS closure. Thus, even when the conformation is partially closed, the binding of another ligand to MtEPSPS­S3P (or another state) would happen. Metallic ions have a significant effect on the activity of EPSPS from Klebsiella pneumoniae [36] and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [37]. It has been demonstrated that SpEPSPS was activated by univalent cations in the following order: NH4 þ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > Cs+ > Li+ [38]. Moreover, SpEPSPS became increasingly more susceptible to inhibition by GLP when increasing NH4 þ concentrations [38]. EPSPS from other species, including E. coli, are not activated by univalent cations. Du et al. [38] and Priestman et al. [32] showed that some monovalent cations are allosteric EPSPS activators, having the ammonium ion as the highest activator, and potassium as a moderate activator. As the used Na/K Pi buffer contains 100 mM of potassium, it could possibly influence the MtEPSPS structure. Nevertheless our thermal-unfolding experiments in potassium absence (with 100 mM of Na2 Pi buffer) presented the same profile as it was observed in the Na/K Pi buffer (data not shown), suggesting that potassium did not influence the MtEPSPS structure and the effects observed were

due to the presence of Pi. We illustrate three other evidences that imply the Pi in the MtEPSPS conformational change is important. First, the Pi dianion is an EPSPS reaction product [3,16]. Second, Pi is found in the EPSPS binding site at the EcEPSPS­S3P crystallographic structure [11]. And third, Pi is able to close on the EcEPSPS­S3P preformed complex, as it is discussed below, even in the presence of potassium [14]. We did not find any report describing the association constant of any EPSPS for Pi, despite the thermodynamic data for the interaction of the EcEPSPS with several ligands [14]. S3P binds to EcEPSPS, but it is unable to induce the domains closure by itself, since the entropy energy variation of this interaction is positive. These data indicate that no high conformation change occurred on the protein structure, leading it to lose the flexibility or to a more compact form [14]. On the other hand, GLP binding to EcEPSPS­S3P complex induces a high negative entropy variation, suggesting a huge conformation change accompanied by a protein organization with loss of flexibility. These data suggest that GLP is able to close on the EcEPSPS [14]. Similar results are reported about the EPSPS from S. pneumoniae [17]. Analyzing the entropy energy variation, the data suggest clearly that the Pi is able to induce the closure motion of the EcEPSPS­S3P preformed complex, like GLP is [14]. In our point of view, this information reinforces that the compact MtEPSPS state described above is due to the Pi binding. Pi may possibly posses multiple binding sites in the EPSPS cleft; because of the many positive charges on their domains interface [12]. This fact may explain the difficulty in determinate the reaction stoichiometry between Pi and EcEPSPS­S3P complexes in the isothermal titration calorimetric experiments performed by Ream et al. [14]. By analyzing the binding site in the crystallographic complex structures of SpEPSPS and EcEPSPS we have observed that the amino acids which interact with the Pi moiety are mainly localized in the N-terminal domain [9­11]. Considering that the S3P binding site is mainly on the N-terminal domain and that it could be able to dislocate the domain equilibrium to the closed conformation [10,11], hence we propose that Pi binding could also induce similar effects on the MtEPSPS structure. Pi may interact with the MtEPSPS N-terminal domain neutralizing the positive charges in the cleft interface allowing the domains to interact, leading to the protein closure. Conclusion In this work, we presented data from three independent tools indicating that Pi induced conformational change on the MtEPSPS structure, leads it to a more compact shape resembling the EPSPSs closed state. The AUC data suggested that the protein in the presence of Pi was more globular than in its absence. The SAXS data clearly suggested that the MtEPSPS in presence of Pi possesses a shape slightly different than in its absence, as analyzed by the

Rg, Dmax, and p (r) curve. Moreover, there was a high correlation coefficient between the experimental and the predicted p (r) curve from the previously modeled MtEPSPS in both closed and open conformation. The protein stability in the thermal-induced unfolding was shifted to higher temperatures in presence of Pi, suggesting that the MtEPSPS structure was more rigid in this condition. Our results are also in accordance with the previously ``dynamic domain motion'' equilibrium described between the open and closed conformation, and that ligand binding leads the MtEPSPS to the closed state. The results presented will be important in the EPSPS­ligand interaction mechanism context, for determining the Pi dianion importance for EPSPS closure and consequently in a drug development context [39].
