ABSTRACT: The X-ray crystal structure of the At5g18200.1 protein has been determined to a nominal resolution of 2.30 Å. The structure has a histidine triad (HIT)-like fold containing two distinct HIT-like motifs. The sequence of At5g18200.1 indicates a distant family relationship to the Escherichia coli galactose-1-P uridylyltransferase (GalT): the determined structure of the At5g18200.1 protein confirms this relationship. The At5g18200.1 protein does not demonstrate GalT activity but instead catalyzes adenylyl transfer in the reaction of ADP-glucose with various phosphates. The best acceptor among those evaluated is phosphate itself; thus, the At5g18200.1 enzyme appears to be an ADP-glucose phosphorylase. The enzyme catalyzes the exchange of 14C between ADP-[14C]glucose and glucose-1-P in the absence of phosphate. The steady state kinetics of exchange follows the ping-pong bi-bi kinetic mechanism, with a kcat of 4.1 s-1 and Km values of 1.4 and 83 µM for ADP-[14C]glucose and glucose-1-P, respectively, at pH 8.5 and 25 °C. The overall reaction of ADP-glucose with phosphate to produce ADP and glucose-1-P follows ping-pong bi-bi steady state kinetics, with a kcat of 2.7 s-1 and Km values of 6.9 and 90 µM for ADP-glucose and phosphate, respectively, at pH 8.5 and 25 °C. The kinetics are consistent with a doubledisplacement mechanism that involves a covalent adenylyl-enzyme intermediate. The X-ray crystal structure of this intermediate was determined to 1.83 Å resolution and shows the AMP group bonded to His186. The value of Keq in the direction of ADP and glucose-1-P formation is 5.0 at pH 7.0 and 25 °C in the absence of a divalent metal ion, and it is 40 in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2.

The At5g18200.1 sequence belongs to the histidine triad (HIT)1 superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases (superfamily E ) 3.0e-45 and 1.0e-29 for the C- and N-terminal portions, respectively) (1). This superfamily contains three distinct families: the histidine triad nucleotidebinding protein family, the fragile histidine triad family, and the GalT family (2). The At5g18200.1 enzyme is a member of the GalT family, which differs from the other two families in several respects: it does not contain a "triad of histidines" but rather a conserved HXHXQ sequence, and the typical reaction catalyzed by enzymes of this family is nucleotidyl

transfer rather than hydrolysis (3). The GalT family contains three known subfamilies of enzymes (3): the GALT-like UDP-hexose:hexose-1-P uridylyltransferases, an adenylylsulfate:phosphate adenylyltransferase from Thiobacillus denitrificans which converts adenosine 5-phosphosulfate and phosphate to ADP and sulfate (4), and diadenosine tetraphosphate phosphorylase whose catalytic activity results in the formation of ATP and ADP (5). In the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, the locus At5g18200.1 (6) encodes a protein that shares amino acid sequence homology with GalT from Escherichia coli (PSIBLAST E ) 6e-21) (7). Because of its homology with GalT, the At5g18200.1 enzyme is annotated as a GalT-like protein. In particular, the His184Ser185His186Ser187Gln188 motif in the At5g18200.1 protein is similar to the active site His164Pro165His166Gly167Gln168 motif of GalT. The reaction

ADP-Glucose Phosphorylase from A. thaliana catalyzed by GalT proceeds by a double-displacement mechanism with a covalent uridylyl-enzyme intermediate, which involves the nucleophilic catalyst His166 (8-10). In this paper, we describe the X-ray crystal structure of the At5g18200.1 protein and a covalent adenylyl-enzyme intermediate. We further describe the catalytic properties of the protein and show that it is not a GalT, but an adenylyltransferase that uses ADP-glucose as the donor substrate and catalyzes transfer of the adenylyl moiety to a broad range of phosphate acceptors. The best acceptor examined is phosphate itself, so the enzyme is an ADP-glucose phosphorylase. We demonstrate that the catalytic mechanism is analogous to that of GalT. We also show that the reaction preferably proceeds in the direction of the formation of ADP and glucose 1-phosphate from ADP-glucose and phosphate. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials. ADP-D-[U-14C]glucose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Activated charcoal, MgCl2, bicine, and EDTA were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, pyruvate kinase, HEPES, and lactic dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma. Monobasic potassium phosphate, KCl, NaCl, NaOH, and HCl were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Microcon centrifugal filter devices were purchased from Amicon/Millipore. Protein Expression and Purification. The At5g18200.1 gene was cloned into a pVP13 plasmid encoding a histidine6-maltose binding protein tag according to the E. colibased protocols described previously (11). Both unlabeled and selenomethionyl-labeled proteins were expressed according to the standard Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics protocol (12). Following sonication, the protein was purified via immobilized nickel affinity chromatography, and TEV protease was used to cleave the affinity/solubility tag (13). After tag capture and a final desalting step, the selenomethionyl-labeled protein was concentrated to 8.4 mg/ mL and dialyzed against 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). The unlabeled protein sample was concentrated to 10.0 mg/mL and dialyzed against 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0). Crystallization. Unlabeled and selenomethionyl At5g18200.1 protein crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 20% (w/ v) PEG 2000, 200 mM NaCl, and 100 mM MES-acetate (pH 5.5). Hanging drops consisted of 2 µL of protein solution mixed with 2 µL of reservoir solution. The crystals were grown at room temperature, and diffraction-quality specimens were obtained within 2-3 days. Crystals of the unliganded protein were then soaked in a series of reservoir solutions containing increasing amounts of ethylene glycol, up to a final concentration of 20% ethylene glycol, and were then flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen. To prepare derivative crystals with the ligand, we first soaked them in a solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 2000, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM ADP-glucose, and 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) for a period of 2 h. Crystals were then cryoprotected and frozen as described above. Data Collection and Reduction. Diffraction data for the native, unliganded structure were collected on beamline 14ID-B BIOCARS at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL) at a wavelength of 0.9786 Å. Two data sets for the

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 10, 2006 3155 selenomethionyl-labeled, unliganded structure were collected on beamline 32-ID-B SBC at a wavelength of 0.9791 Å. The diffraction images were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (14). Initial attempts to define the selenium substructure of the crystals failed. Therefore, a molecular replacement in Molrep (6, 16) was attempted using the GALT dimer (PDB entry 1gup) as a search model. A very weak solution was obtained that provided the initial phase information necessary for the location of the strongest anomalous scatterers. The selenium substructure was completed with several cycles of SAD phasing and inspection of anomalous and gradient anomalous difference maps. The final set of anomalous scatterers was used for SAD phasing in CNS (17). Initial phase information to 3.5 Å was further improved and extended to the 2.4 Å resolution of the native data set by density modification and phase extension as implemented in CNS. The structure was built from the GALT dimer model and completed using alternate cycles of manual building in O (18) and Xfit (19) and crystallographic refinement in CNS. The native, liganded structure data were collected on beamline 19-BM SBC-CAT at Argonne National Laboratory at a wavelength of 0.97948 Å. HKL2000 was again used to integrate and scale the diffraction data, and initial phases were determined with MOLREP using the unliganded At5g18200.1 structure as the search model. Refinement was carried out using REFMAC (16, 20), and the model was built with Xfit. Assays. Adenylyltransferase activity was initially measured by the coupled assay employed for GalT, substituting ADPglucose for UDP-glucose and using galactose-1-P, mannose1-P, or Pi as the acceptor substrate (8). UV-visible spectrophotometry was performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The rate of glucose-1-P formation was measured by a coupled assay using NADP+, phosphoglucomutase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The assay was carried out in 1.0 mL containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM NADP+, 0.5 µM glucose 1,6-diphosphate, 0.1 unit/mL phosphoglucomutase, and 0.1 unit/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The increase in A340 due to NADPH formation was used to calculate the glucose-1-P content of the aliquot, using 6.22 mM-1 cm-1 as the extinction coefficient. The rate of ADP formation was measured enzymatically. The assay was carried out in 1.0 mL containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 2 mM MgCl2, 75 mM KCl, 0.2 mM NADH, 0.3 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 unit/mL lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 unit/mL pyruvate kinase. The decrease in A340 due to consumption of NADH was used to calculate the amount of ADP in the aliquot, with 6.22 mM-1 cm-1 as the extinction coefficient. Methods. The extinction coefficient for the At5g18200.1 protein at 280 nm was determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (21). First, the value of 280 for the denatured protein in 6 M guanidine-HCl ( den) was calculated from the number of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine residues per molecule of the protein and their respective values of 280. Then absorbances at 280 nm of the native (Absnat) and denatured (Absden) proteins were measured at identical protein concentrations. The extinction coefficient for the native protein ( nat) was calculated using the equation nat )

(Absnat den)/Absden. The nat value determined for the At5g18200.1 monomer was 32.0 ( 0.4 mM-1 cm-1. The equilibrium constant for the reaction of ADP-glucose with Pi to produce ADP and glucose-1-P was evaluated as follows. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min to reach equilibrium followed by heating in boiling water for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme. The reaction mixtures (2.0 mL) initially contained 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM Pi, 0.05 mM ADP-glucose, and 25 µg/mL ADP-glucose phosphorylase. After centrifugation of the coagulated enzyme (10 min at 14 000 rpm), aliquots of the supernatant fluid were enzymatically assayed for glucose-1-P and ADP content. To study the effect of Mg2+, the experiment was also performed in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2. These experiments were carried out under variable concentrations of substrates and enzyme and also for longer reaction times. The results showed that equilibrium had been attained under all conditions that were employed. Steady State Kinetics. A radiochemical method for assaying GalT (8) was adapted to measuring the initial rates of the reaction of ADP-glucose with Pi to form ADP and glucose-1-P. Each reaction mixture (1.5 mL) contained 0.1 M sodium bicinate (pH 8.5), 5-60 µM inorganic phosphate, 0.2-7.0 µM ADP-[14C]glucose (3.7 × 106 to 2.6 × 107 cpm/ µmol), and 6.7 nM At5g18200.1 enzyme. The reactions were started by addition of the enzyme. At predetermined times, aliquots of the reaction mixture were added to 20 mg of activated charcoal and mixed thoroughly to stop the reaction. The mixtures were centrifuged and the supernatant fluids filtered, using Microcon YM-50 centrifugal filter devices. Aliquots of filtrates were assayed radiochemically for 14C using liquid scintillation counting on a Beckman LS 6500 spectrometer. Progress curves were linear and gave the initial rates. The initial rates for the exchange of [14C]glucose between ADP-glucose and glucose-1-P were measured by the charcoal-

quench method described above for the overall reaction. In this case, the reaction mixtures (1.5 mL) contained 0.1 M sodium bicinate (pH 8.5), 10-400 µM glucose-1-P, 0.251.0 µM ADP-[14C]glucose (2.8 × 107 cpm/µmol), and 8.0 nM At5g18200.1 enzyme. The linear progress curves yielded initial rates. Data Analysis. The initial rate data were computer fitted to eq 1 for the ping-pong mechanism using the PNGPNG program of Cleland (22):

where A and B refer to ADP-glucose and Pi, respectively. Values of V are the experimental initial rates. kcat values were obtained through the division of Vm values by the enzyme concentration. RESULTS Structure Determination. The structure of the At5g18200.1 protein has been determined to a resolution of 2.30 Å. The relevant statistics are given in Table 1. The protein forms a dimer with each chain comprising 351 amino acids. The asymmetric unit contains the biological homodimer, labeled as chains A and B. Several surface loops were not modeled due to insufficient electron density. These include amino acids 1-22, 40-47, 52-61, and 106-115 of chain A as well as residues 1-20, 40-45, 51-61, 68-71, 106-115, and 351 of chain B. A Ramachandran plot indicates 557 of the 600 modeled amino acids are in the most favored - regions with the remainder falling in the generously allowed regions. The asymmetric unit also contains 225 ordered water molecules. Each monomer in the asymmetric unit coordinates two zinc atoms via two cysteine and two histidine side chains. Protein Fold. The overall fold of the monomer is shown in Figure 1 and consists of an antiparallel open-faced -pleated sheet formed by -strands C, D, F, H, G, L, M,

K, J, and I that surround two antiparallel amphipathic helices (5 and 10) that overlap near their N-termini forming an angle of roughly 50°. Short helices (4 and 9) are positioned roughly 90° from the primary axes of helices 5 and 11 such that their amino termini point directly toward the -sheet. The remaining -strands form a mixed intersubunit -sheet which consists of strands A, B, and N of one monomer and strand E from the other. Strand B also makes contacts with a turn from the opposing chain. In addition, the protrusion containing helix 12 makes extensive contacts with helix 6, the loop running from the carboxy terminus of strand H to the amino terminus of helix 7, and -strands M, L, and G of the other monomer (see Figure 2). The average buried solvent accessible surface area of the interface is 1955 Å2. Catalyzed Reaction. Since the At5g18200.1 protein is annotated as a GalT-like uridylyltransferase, the enzyme was tested for GalT activity. GalT catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose and galactose-1-P into glucose-1-P and UDPgalactose. The production of glucose-1-P forms the basis for the standard assay (8). The coupled assay includes phosphoglucomutase, glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, and NADP+ and measures the level of glucose-1-P formation through

formation of NADPH. Surprisingly, the At5g18200.1 protein displays less than 5 × 10-5 of the activity of E. coli GalT. Therefore, we performed detailed substrate specificity studies. These studies reveal adenylyltransferase activity with ADPglucose as the donor and galactose-1-P as the acceptor. Typical results shown in Table 2 indicate that the At5g18200.1 enzyme is almost 10 times more active in the GalT assay with ADP-glucose as the donor substrate, and it is another 2.8 times more active with mannose-1-P as the acceptor substrate. The preferential utilization of ADP-glucose and mannose-1-P rather than UDP-glucose and glucose-1-P clearly shows that the At5g18200.1 enzyme does not possess GalT activity. ADP-glucose and inorganic phosphate are the best donor and acceptor substrates, respectively, so far tested. The entries in Table 2 show the activity with ADP-glucose and Pi to be more than 700 times that with UDP-glucose and galactose-1-P. The enzyme does not display ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase activity, as shown by the fact that MgPPi does not serve as an acceptor. In preliminary experiments to narrow the focus on substrate preference, apparent values of Vmax and Km confirm and quantify the preferences implied by the survey data in Table 2. Assaying for glucose-1-P production from ADPglucose, at 1 mM galactose-1-P, we find a value of Kmapp

3158 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 10, 2006 for ADP-glucose of 7 µM, and at 5 µM ADP-glucose, the value of Kmapp for galactose-1-P is 2 mM. In contrast, the value of Kmapp for Pi is 18 µM at 20 µM ADP-glucose. When rates are compared, at 5 µM ADP-glucose, the value of the apparent second-order rate constant [(kcat/Km)app] for the reaction of galactose-1-P is 3 × 102 M-1 s-1, and that for the reaction of Pi at 20 µM ADP-glucose is 4 × 105 M-1 s-1. These constants cannot be compared directly because of the 4-fold difference in concentrations of ADP-glucose. However, even if the value for Pi were 4-fold lower (this would be the maximum normalization), the ratio of apparent second-order rate constants would be more than 300 in favor of the reaction of Pi. It must be concluded that the At5g18200.1 enzyme is not a GalT, nor an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, but it is an adenylyltransferase that displays selectivity for ADP-glucose and Pi as donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. Kinetic Mechanism. The reactions catalyzed by the At5g18200.1 enzyme and GalT are chemically similar, in that both catalyze nucleotidyl transfer with nucleotide sugars as donor substrates and phosphates as acceptors. Therefore, given the sequence and structure homology, the chemical and kinetic mechanisms might be analogous. If so, the adenylyltransferase should function by a double-displacement chemical mechanism and ping-pong kinetics through a covalent nucleotidyl-enzyme intermediate, as does GalT. Alternatively, the reaction might proceed by a sequential kinetic mechanism characteristic of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, with no covalent intermediate. Steady state kinetic analysis distinguishes these mechanisms. Equations 2 and 3 describe the hypothetical doubledisplacement mechanism with ping-pong kinetics for the action of the At5g18200.1 enzyme, where His186 is the central histidine in the putative catalytic His184Ser185His186Ser187Gln188 motif.

FIGURE 3: Initial rates for exchange of 14C from ADP-[14C]glucose into glucose-1-P. The initial rates were measured as described in Experimental Procedures and plotted in double-reciprocal form. The ADP-[14C]glucose (2.8 × 107 cpm/µmol) concentrations were 0.251.0 µM, and glucose-1-P concentrations were 10-400 µM. The velocity units are micromolar per minute with 8.1 × 10-3 µM At5g18200.1 enzyme. The parameters resulting from fitting eq 1 to the data are listed in Table 3.

According to this mechanism, the enzyme must catalyze the exchange of 14C between ADP-[14C]glucose and glucose1-P in the absence of Pi with ping-pong kinetics and at a rate that is compatible with the rate of the overall reaction. The At5g18200.1 enzyme satisfies both criteria, as shown in Figure 3, where the reciprocals of the initial rates of exchange are plotted against the reciprocal of the concentration of glucose-1-P at three fixed concentrations of ADP[14C]glucose. The observation of exchange supports eq 2 as a step in the kinetic mechanism, and the parallel line pattern supports the ping-pong kinetic mechanism with a covalent AMP-enzyme as an intermediate. The kinetic parameters for the exchange reaction, obtained by fitting the data presented in Figure 3 to eq 1 for the ping-pong kinetic mechanism, are given in Table 3. If the kinetic and chemical mechanism of eqs 2 and 3 is correct, the steady state kinetics of the overall reaction must also conform to eq 1. As shown in Figure 4, the doublereciprocal plot of steady state kinetic data is a set of parallel lines corresponding to eq 1. When fitted to the data in Figure

Initial rates of glucose-1-P formation at varying ADP-[14C]glucose concentrations and several fixed Pi concentrations were measured as described in Experimental Procedures and plotted in double-reciprocal form. The ADP-[14C]glucose concentrations were 0.2-7.0 µM, and Pi concentrations were 5-60 µM. The velocity units are micromolar per minute at 6.7 × 10-3 µM At5g18200.1 enzyme. The parameters resulting from fitting eq 1 to the data are listed in Table 3.

4, the kinetic parameters in Table 3 are obtained. Comparison with the parameters for the ADP-[14C]glucose-glucose-1-P exchange shows that the exchange reaction is faster, so the exchange rate is kinetically compatible with the rate and mechanism of the overall reaction. The kinetics of the exchange and overall reactions strongly support the ping-

pong kinetic mechanism and the chemistry of eqs 2 and 3, and they rule out all sequential kinetic mechanisms. According to the kinetic mechanism, the reaction of the At5g18200.1 enzyme with ADP-glucose must produce the covalent adenylyl-enzyme intermediate. In this study, this intermediate is isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography in work that is described in a later section. Equilibrium Constant (Keq). The reaction of ADP-glucose with Pi to form ADP and glucose-1-P should be energetically reasonably balanced. We measured the value of Keq at pH 7.0 in the absence of Mg2+ and found it to be 5.0 ( 0.3. While the reaction to form glucose-1-P is fairly well favored, Mg2+ should draw it much further to completion because of the formation of MgADP and the relatively weak binding of Mg2+ to ADP-glucose. Accordingly, the value of Keq in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2 is 40 ( 1. Thus, in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, the reaction is strongly favored in the forward direction, with a G° value of -2.2 kcal/mol. Crystallographic Isolation of the AMP-Enzyme Intermediate. The covalently modified enzyme structure was determined to a resolution of 1.83 Å (Table 1). The electron density for AMP was clearly evident in the electron density map. The R-phosphorus of AMP was refined to a position 1.8 Å from NE2 of His186 in chain A and 1.7 Å in chain B. The coordination of AMP is identical in both chains A and B. A number of hydrogen bonds are observed coordinating the AMP molecule (see Figure 5). The side chain amines of Gln188 and Asn173 both coordinate with one of the oxygens of the R-phosphate of AMP. In addition, a solvent molecule is within hydrogen bonding distance of both the oxygen and the backbone amine of Asn173 (not shown). Gln188 appears to make a second contact with the bridging oxygen of AMP as well. The other phosphate oxygen is within hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone amines of Ser181 and Met182. The side chain of Asn96 is within hydrogen bonding distance of O2 and O3 of the ribose sugar. The adenine group is coordinated to the backbone amines of Ala74 and Leu95 and the backbone carbonyl group of Glu72. Additional stabilization is provided by "T stacking interactions" through the side chains of Phe65 and Tyr94. DISCUSSION Protein Fold. The overall fold of the At5g18200.1 protein is quite similar to that of the E. coli GalT (DALI score ) 31.8). The largest discernible difference between the two monomers is between residues 70 and 90 of the Arabidopsis protein and the analogous region in GalT. This region corresponds to strand C in the At5g18200.1 enzyme but in GalT forms a small two-stranded -sheet. A further differ-

FIGURE 6: Role of zinc in catalysis. The zinc ion bound by the side chain of His184 may be necessary for positioning the main chain carbonyl oxygen of His184 2.7 Å from ND1 of His186 in chain A (2.8 Å in chain B). This interaction may help stabilize the HisAMP intermediate. Zinc is depicted as a gray sphere. This figure was generated with Pymol (35).

ence is that the buried surface area between the At5g18200.1 monomers is only slightly more than half the value reported for the GalT dimer. The difference appears to be due mainly to the missing loops of the At5g18200.1 protein, which in GalT are involved in the dimer interface but for which there was insufficient electron density to build into the At5g18200.1 protein model. Zinc Binding Sites. In addition, there is a difference in metal binding between the two enzymes. The E. coli GalT monomer contains both a zinc and an iron atom (23); the identities of these metals have been confirmed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (24). It has been further shown that enzyme activity is dependent on the occupation of the zinc binding site; however, a variety of metals appear to support catalysis (24, 25). The two metal ions in each At5g18200.1 protein subunit were assumed to be zinc on the basis of their coordination and anomalous signal. One of the zinc sites is identical to the zinc site found in GalT, directly adjacent to the active site. Figure 6 depicts the coordination of the zinc ion in the At5g18200.1 enzyme and illustrates its possible role in catalysis. As originally seen and described in the E. coli GalT structure (26), the zinc appears to be positioning the carbonyl of His184 within hydrogen bonding distance of ND1 of His186. This may be critical for stabilizing the nucleotidylated intermediate and allowing the reaction to proceed. The second zinc atom is located in a position different from that of the iron atom from GalT, although they share

FIGURE 7: Portion of the sequence alignment between uridylyltransferases and putative adenylyltransferases. The At5g18200.1 enzyme and all putative adenylyltransferases from plant species are labeled in green. Putative adenylyltransferases from bacteria are labeled in red. Sequence labels for confirmed uridylyltransferases are colored blue. Residues that appear to distinguish adenylyltransferases from uridylyltransferases are colored orange. The top block of sequences corresponds to the adenine/uridine binding region. The bottom block corresponds to the region that contains the HXHXQ active site motif. The start codon for some of the sequences was unclear, and subsequently, no residue numbering was included. The alignment was created with ClustalW (37). The sequence codes for the sequences included in the alignment are as follows: NP_197321 (GenBank), TC156309 (TIGR), TC113581 (TIGR), TC40775 (TIGR), 9635.m00702 (Plastid Proteome Database), TC237707 (TIGR), NP_228704 (GenBank), EA03679 (GenBank), AAF64398 (GenBank), P09148 (UniProt), and P07902 (UniProt).

one liganding side chain. The side chain of His310 in the At5g18200.1 enzyme is oriented differently from its conserved sequence counterpart in GalT, subsequently shifting the metal binding site 12.5 Å from where it is located in GalT toward the surface of the protein. It was proposed that the iron atom in GalT plays a role in stabilizing the domainswapped dimer interface (23), but in the At5g18200.1 enzyme, this appears less likely. Enzyme ActiVity. The ADP-glucose phosphorylase activity of the At5g18200.1 enzyme is the same as that described 40 years ago for an ADP-glucose:orthophosphate adenylyltransferase in extracts of wheat germ (27). The wheat germ enzyme was partially purified and shown to accept ADP1R-D-glucose, 2-deoxy-ADP-1R-D-glucose, and ADP-1 D-glucose as adenylyl group donors; however, it was not purified to homogeneity. Both the At5g18200.1 enzyme and the wheat germ adenylyltransferase display the activity corresponding to the systematically named ADP:R-D-aldose1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.36). No information about the kinetic or chemical mechanism is available for the wheat germ enzyme. Production of glucose-1-P without pyrophosphate (which is required by the enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) has been reported for several plant extracts, including barley and Arabidopsis (28). In that study, the authors isolated and purified a 35 kDa enzyme from barley leaves that they identified as an ADP-glucose pyrophosphatase, catalyzing the hydrolysis of ADP-glucose into glucose-1-P and AMP. Addition of phosphate was shown to competitively inhibit the enzyme. No sequence was given for the barley enzyme, but it seems unlikely that this protein is identical to the At5g18200.1 enzyme despite the possibility that they serve a similar role in regulating starch production.

A partially purified adenylyltransferase from Euglena gracilis catalyzes the reaction of ADP-5-ribose with phosphate to form ADP and ribose 1,5-bisphosphate (29). This enzyme catalyzes the ADP-Pi exchange in the absence of ribose 1,5-bisphosphate, apparently by the mechanism of eq 3. The Euglena adenylyltransferase does not accept ADPglucose as a substrate, so it cannot be the same as the enzyme described here, although the reaction mechanisms may be similar. However, the At5g18200.1 enzyme efficiently catalyzes the phosphorolysis of ADP-5-ribose (data not shown). The activity of the At5g18200.1 enzyme is analogous to previously reported nucleotide sugar phosphorolysis activities of enzymes displaying substrate preferences for GDPmannose and UDP-glucose (30). These enzymes also catalyze exchange reactions such as UDP-Pi exchange which is analogous to the ADP-glucose-glucose-1-P exchange described here for the At5g18200.1 enzyme. Sequence Analysis. A series of BLAST searches using the entire At5g18200.1 enzyme sequence, as well as a portion of the sequence corresponding to the enzyme's adenine binding region, resulted in the identification of a number of plant and bacterial enzymes which may be functionally similar to At5g18200.1. A partial sequence alignment containing a representative sample of these enzymes (Figure 7) reveals a number of residues that may prove to be useful in distinguishing between uridylyltransferases and adenylyltransferases. All of these enzymes are annotated as putative galactose-1-P uridylyltransferases with the exception of those from E. coli and Homo sapiens, which are confirmed galactose-1-P uridylyltransferases, and the enzyme from Thiobacillus denitrificans which is annotated as an adenylylsulfate:phosphate transferase.

ADP-Glucose Phosphorylase from A. thaliana The At5g18200.1 enzyme residues that appear to be unique for adenylyltransferases include Phe65, which is involved in stabilizing the adenine ring through stacking interactions. Residues homologous to Glu70, Trp87, and Arg90 are also strongly conserved. These residues correspond to a region of the At5g18200.1 enzyme that is structurally distinct from GalT of E. coli. Specifically, an extended loop between helix 2 and strand C makes additional contacts with the adenine group (Figure 1). The side chains of Glu70, Trp87, and Arg90 are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions that may help stabilize this extended loop. Asp98 (E. coli) is a unique, strongly conserved residue in GalT enzymes. This residue coordinates the uridine group in the E. coli structure (26) but is converted to either a leucine or lysine in the putative adenylyltransferase sequences. We do not have enough data to distinguish between enzymes with adenylylsulfate:phosphate transferase activity and enzymes with ADP-glucose phosphorylase activity through sequence alignments. The glucose binding region would be the most likely place to distinguish between these activities as the adenylylsulfate:phosphate transferase would have no need to bind glucose. The sequences of the glucose binding regions of potential adenylyltransferases and uridylyltransferases are surprisingly different; however, many of the interactions with glucose in the E. coli GalT structure involved backbone atoms (31). Structural alignment of GalT and the At5g18200.1 protein reveals that the positions of the relevant backbone atoms are in identical positions despite the low level of sequence conservation. Of the five residues in GalT with side chains coordinated to glucose, four are conserved in every sequence, including that of adenylylsulfate:phosphate transferase. As a result, it is difficult to distinguish between adenylylsulfate:phosphate transferases and ADP-glucose phosphorylases. In addition, all of the putative adenylyltransferases have two cysteine and two histidine residues corresponding to those involved in coordinating the second zinc atom in the At5g18200.1 enzyme, and all are missing one or more residues needed for coordinating iron as in the E. coli GalT structure (23). Possible Role in Starch Synthesis. The biological function of the At5g18200.1 protein cannot be assigned solely on the basis of in vitro biochemical properties. The catalyzed reaction represents a means of degrading ADP-glucose in such a way as to conserve the free energy of the phosphoanhydride and aldose 1-phosphate linkages. On this basis, we hypothesize that this enzyme participates in ADP-glucose homeostasis. ADP-glucose is known to play a prominent role in starch metabolism in plants (32). ADP-glucose is synthesized by the enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (APGase) and is then polymerized via the soluble and granulebound starch synthases (33). While most evidence has suggested that these reactions take place entirely in the plastids of noncereal plants, such as Arabidopsis, recent studies have suggested that ADP-glucose may also be synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the plastid (34, 35). The At5g18200.1 enzyme is not currently implicated in this regulation. Also, the conditions under which and the cellular compartments of Arabidopsis in which the At5g18200.1 enzyme is normally produced are not known. Moreover, although the enzyme is quite active with ADPglucose and Pi (kcat/Km ) 0.4 × 106 s-1 M-1 for the reaction

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 10, 2006 3161 of ADP-glucose at saturating Pi concentrations), there could be even better substrates. We can assert that whenever this enzyme is present with ADP-glucose, Pi, and Mg2+ the ADPglucose will be converted to ADP and glucose-1-P. Biological experiments, including gene deletions, will be required to deduce the biological function of the Arabidopsis At5g18200.1 enzyme. In conclusion, we have determined the structure of the At5g18200.1 protein and established its structural homology to E. coli GalT. We have shown that the enzyme does not possess GalT activity but instead displays adenylyltranferase activity. We have further shown that, of the substrates tested, the enzyme displays the greatest activity when ADP-glucose and Pi are used as the donor and acceptor, respectively, making the enzyme an ADP-glucose phosphorylase, or ADPGPase. We have determined kinetic and equilibrium constants for this reaction and shown that the reaction proceeds through a bi-bi double-displacement mechanism. We have also isolated and observed the enzyme-AMP intermediate suggested by this mechanism through X-ray crystallography.
