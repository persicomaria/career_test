Analysis of the published amino acid sequences of the enzyme ketol acid reductoisomerase (KARI) from seven organisms identified three regions with highly conserved sequences. One of these regions is predicted to be the dinucleotide fold where NADPH binds. In order to confirm that this region did include the NADPH binding site, we used oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis to study the function of specific amino acids in this region in terms of their interactions with NADPH. Four positively charged amino acids, R68, K69, K75, and R76, were mutated singly, in different combinations, and finally as a quartet in order to evaluate electrostatic interactions with NADPH. Mutation of each of the arginines singly to glutamine results in a 60- to 100-fold reduction in kcat/ Km for NADPH. Mutation of each of the lysines singly does not significantly alter the steady state kinetic parameters associated with NADPH. None of these mutations significantly alters the affinity of the enzyme for NADH. After looking at double mutations of these four amino acids, we constructed the quadruplet mutant R68DK69LK75VR76D. This mutant has Km and kcat values of 19.3 mM and 5.3 min01 for NADH, which compares to 207 mM and 0.11 min01 for the wild-type enzyme. For the quadruplet mutant the corresponding values for NADPH are ú200 mM for Km and 2 min01 for kcat compared to 7.3 mM and 7.2 min01 for the wild-type enzyme. By altering these four amino acids, the specificity constants for NADH and NADPH are almost exactly reversed in the mutant relative to the wild type. 1997

The biosynthetic pathway for the three branched chain amino acids begins with two enzymes that catalyze reactions leading to all three products (1). This pathway is of interest since it is the target of several types of herbicides (2). The second enzyme of the pathway, ketol acid reductoisomerase (KARI),3 catalyzes the reaction given by Scheme 1. The two-step reaction involves an alkyl migration and a ketone reduction that occurs at a single active site on the enzyme without dissociation of any reaction intermediates (3, 4). The gene encoding KARI (the ilvC gene in bacteria) from eight different organisms has been identified and sequenced. There are three regions of conserved sequence, one of which has been shown to be the binding sites for the two metal ions required by the enzyme (5). The region between amino acid numbers 38 and 76 in the E. coli sequence is proposed to be the dinucleotide binding region where NADPH binds (5, 6). The GxGxxG(A) motif is located in this sequence (7). This motif contains the amino acids of the turn region. The turn lies at the junction of the first b and a of the b ­ a ­ b fold found in all dehydrogenases and kinases. There are several conserved hydrophobic amino acids in this region that serve to stabilize the fold by packing the b strands against the a helix. The amino acid sequences in this region can be aligned as given in Fig. 1. Interestingly, there appear to be two types of insertions in this region. The plant enzymes show one insertion begin3 Abbreviations used: KARI, ketol acid reductoisomerase; IPTG, isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside.

ning 11 amino acids from the end of the GxGxxG(A) signature. Then the plant, yeast, mold, and Escherichia coli genes show a second insertion about 11 amino acids further along the sequence. Based on analogy with the dinucleotide fold region of other dehydrogenases, the region where these insertions occur should contain the amino acid whose side chain makes contact with the group at the 2 position of adenosine portion of NAD(P)H (8). In dehydrogenases, when the amino acid side chain that makes this contact is R or K, the enzyme is specific for NADPH, but when it is D or E, the dehydrogenase is specific for NADH. This simple substitution is not the only determinant of the nucleotide specificity, and in fact, Perham and Schulz have shown using X ray structures that many subtle structural changes are necessary to explain the nucleotide specificity of glutathione reductase from E. coli (9). Many dehydrogenases can be used in the enantiospecific synthesis of chiral molecules (10). Dehydrogenases that use NADPH as the reductant are less attractive from an economic standpoint since schemes for the regeneration of NADPH are generally more expensive than those for NADH. It may be possible to engineer the nucleotide specificity for dehydrogenases (9). Several instances where the nucleotide specificity of a particular dehydrogenase has been altered are known in the literature (8, 11 ­ 17). However, instances where a complete reversal of specificity have been achieved are rare. The X ray structure of KARI from E. coli has not yet been determined. In spite of this, we took a very simple approach to engineer a change in nucleotide specificity for KARI from E. coli, and in so doing have precisely identified the region of the enzyme that is responsible for binding NADPH. We mutated the amino acids that could potentially lead to electrostatic based selection of NADPH over NADH. In so doing, we increased the kcat/Km of the enzyme for NADH by more than 500-fold. This lead to a decrease in kcat/Km for NADPH by more than 100-fold. This switch in specificity was accomplished while maintaining the kcat and Km at values very close to those of the wild-type enzyme.
EXPERIMENTAL
General. The plasmid pRWB1 was a gift of Ron Wek from the University of California, Irvine. M13mp18 and CJ236 were obtained

from Bio-Rad. The TG1 strain was obtained from Amersham. The expression vector, pKK223-3, was obtained from Pharmacia. The NAD(P)(H) was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim. The bacteriological media was from Difco Laboratories. Other microbiological media additives and chromatography material were obtained from Sigma except for the hydroxylapatite which was from Bio-Rad. The NA-45 DEAE membrane was purchased from Schleicher and Schuell. The custom oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Restriction enzymes, ligases, and kinases used for cloning were obtained from BRL, Promega, USB, and New England Biolabs. The enzyme substrates, acetolactate, and 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methyl butyrate, were kindly provided by Dr. G. T. Mrachko. The procedures for restriction enzyme digests, plasmid isolation, ligation, and transformation were from Maniatis et al. (18). Following restriction digestion, the DNA fragment to be cloned was isolated from 0.8 or 1% agarose gels using NA-45 membranes (19). The sitedirected mutagenesis procedure was based on the method developed by Kunkel (20) using a kit from Bio-Rad. Oligodeoxynucleotides used for mutagenesis. All mutations of the ilvC gene were designed to introduce or eliminate a restriction endonuclease site. The sequence of the ilvC gene is found in the GenBank entry with Accession No. M11689. The following oligonucleotides were used to make the indicated mutants: T375T K69L R76Q R68Q R76D K75Q R68DK69L R76QR68A R68DK69LK75VR76D ATCGACCATCGTTTCGAA ATCGCTTCTAGACGCAGAGCG GCCAGGACGCCTGCTTCTCGGC TCGCTTCTTTCTGCAGAGCGTA CCAGGACGCGTCCTTCTCGGCA AGGACGCGCGTTGCTCGGCAATC TCGCTTCTAGGTCCAGAGCGTAG ATCGCTTCTTTGGCCAGAGCGTAGG ACGCCAGGACGCGTCGACCTCGG CAATCGCT

The T375T mutant eliminates an NcoI restriction site internal to the ilvC gene but does not change the amino acid sequence of KARI. By eliminating this internal site we were able to use an NcoI site at the initial methionine codon of the gene to create an NcoI/HindIII gene cassette that we could clone into the pKK233-2 expression vector. All other single mutations were performed using the T375T mutation as the template for the mutagenesis. The R68D K69L mutation used K69L as the template, while R76QR68A used R76Q as the template. The quadruplet mutation used R68DK69L as the template. Subcloning, bacterial growth, and expression. The ilvC gene contained in pRW1B was restricted out using BglII and HindIII. The 1.8-kb fragment containing ilvC was cloned into M13mp18-rf that had been similarly cut. After the site directed mutagenesis was completed, plaques were screened by isolating the double-stranded phage DNA and subjecting it restriction analysis. Appropriate plaques were selected, grown, and the double-stranded DNA isolated and digested with NcoI and HindIII. The resulting 1.8-kb fragment was cloned into pKK233-2 that was similarly cut. These plasmids were then transformed into TG1 cells. The bacteria were grown overnight in LB broth supplemented with 100 mg/mL of ampicillin at 37 C. This

NADPH BINDING SITE OF REDUCTOISOMERASE overnight culture was used to inoculate one liter of fresh LB containing ampicillin. The bacteria were grown with vigorous aeration to an OD600 of 1.0. At this point, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mM, and the bacteria were grown for another 3 h. The culture was then centrifuged at 12,000g for 30 min at 4 C. The bacterial pellet was frozen and stored at 070 C. Enzyme purification. The wild-type, single, and double-mutant enzymes were isolated as before (4) up to the 65% ammonium sulfate precipitation except that the buffer used for all steps was 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 4 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA. The enzyme was assayed to monitor the purification as before (21). After the enzyme was pelleted with 65% saturated ammonium sulfate, a red-A column (Sigma) (2.5 1 15.0 cm) was equilibrated with 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 4 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA. The 65% pellet was dissolved in the above buffer and was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. After the enzyme was loaded on the column it was washed with at least one bed volume of the above Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The enzyme was eluted with a 400-mL linear gradient of (0­1 M) NaCl in the above pH 8.0 Tris buffer. The active fractions of reductoisomerase were pooled, made 70% saturated in ammonium sulfate, and centrifuged at 12,000g for an hour. The pellet was resuspended in a pH 6.5 buffer containing 10 mM KH2PO4 , 4 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. An hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad) (2.5 1 10.0 cm) was equilibrated with the above 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. After the enzyme was layered on the column, it was washed with at least one bed volume of the 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, buffer and the enzyme eluted with a linear gradient of 0.01 to 0.4 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. The active fractions were pooled, made 70% saturated with ammonium sulfate, and centrifuged at 12,000g for an hour. The purified enzyme was stored at 4 C as the ammonium sulfate pellet. Purification of the quadruplet mutant. The purification of the quadruplet mutant was altered slightly from the purification scheme of the wild-type and other mutants. The procedure was not optimized. The enzyme activity was assayed using NADH in place of NADPH. The cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide step was omitted since the quadruplet mutant lost activity in the presence of this reagent. Unlike the wild-type protein, this mutant fractionated out in the 40% ammonium sulfate pellet. The K69LR68DK75VR76D protein was purified using a DEAE-cellulose column, as it did not bind to the red-A column. The pellet from the 40% ammonium sulfate fraction was dissolved in 25 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 4 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The enzyme solution was layered onto a DEAE cellulose column (1.5 1 28 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with 2 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a 0.2­1.2 M KCl gradient in the Tris buffer. The elution gradient was applied over 5 column volumes. The active fractions were pooled, made 70% saturated with solid ammonium sulfate, and centrifuged at 12,000g for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 25 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 4 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 25% saturation with (NH4)2SO4 . This solution was dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 25% saturation resulted in the precipitation of some extraneous proteins. The enzyme solution was centrifuged at 12,000g for 45 min and the supernatant dialyzed against 10 mM KH2PO4 , pH 7.5, buffer containing 4 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA. The enzyme was pure as judged by SDS­PAGE. Kinetic analysis. For each enzyme, initial assays were performed to determine the approximate Km values for NADPH or NADH, acetolactate, NADP or NAD, and 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methyl butyrate. To determine the kinetic parameters for each substrate, the fixed substrate was kept at 10­15 times its Km value while the concentration

85

of the variable substrate ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 times its Km value. Where appropriate, the concentration of competitive inhibitors ranged from 0.8 to 2 times their Kis values. The buffer used for the assays was 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 4 mM MgCl2 , 3 mM mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM EDTA. The nucleotide solutions were prepared fresh each day. The concentrations of the 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methyl butyrate and acetolactate stock solutions were determined by the total absorbance change at 340 nm in a reaction where the concentration of nucleotide was 3­4 times that of the organic acid substrate. The concentrations of NAD(P)H solutions were determined using an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mM01 at 340 nm. The concentration of the pure enzyme was determined from the A280 using an extinction coefficient of 50.93 mM01 for a monomer of reductoisomerase. The extinction coefficient was calculated from the amino acid composition by the method of von Hipple (22). The kinetic data were fit to standard enzyme kinetic equations using BASIC versions of the computer programs of Cleland (23). Protein stability measurements. The stability of the folded state of the wild-type and mutant enzymes was assessed by measuring (H the DGD 2O) . This parameter measures how much more stable the native conformation of the protein is than the denatured conformations. Ultraviolet difference spectroscopy at 279 nm was used to assess the extent of enzyme denaturation at various concentrations of urea (24). The analysis of the denaturation curves was done using the method described by Pace (25). A plot of the free energy change (H at each urea concentration was extrapolated to give the DGD 2O) (26).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Many proteins, including NAD(P) dehydrogenases and kinases, exhibit a common structural feature known as the Rossmann fold domain (27). This dinucleotide binding domain consists of a highly conserved b ­ a ­ b motif (28). This motif can be used to identify NAD(H)/NADP(H) binding regions in enzymes of unknown structure. Wierenga et al. (29) proposed the existence of a fingerprint of 11 specific positions in NAD dehydrogenases which include an invariant GXGXXG(A) sequence which extends from the C-terminal end of the first b-strand to the N-terminal end of the following a-helix, a hydrophobic core composed of six small residues and an acidic residue at the C-terminus of the second b-strand which forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of the adenine ribose. The NADP(H)-linked proteins have highly conserved positively charged amino acids near the C-terminal region of the b ­ a ­ b motif. These positively charged residues lie at the C-terminal end of the b strand and interact with the negatively charged phosphate of the adenosine ribose of NADP(H). Hence the C-terminal region of the second b strand confers the nucleotide specificity to a particular enzyme and thus controls the relative affinity of the dehydrogenase for NAD(H) and NADP(H). Both the NAD(H)- and NADP(H)-linked enzymes have a sequence of highly conserved hydrophobic amino acids. The role of these amino acids is to pack the bstrands against the a-helix by hydrophobic interactions, which in turn stabilizes the b ­ a ­ b unit. Our goal was to identify the positively charged amino acid(s) that confer NADPH specificity on KARI and

86

thereby precisely determine the C-terminal end of the second b strand of the b ­ a ­ b motif. Based on the multiple sequence alignment of KARI from different sources, we considered that either arginine 68 or lysine 75 was involved in electrostatic interactions with the 2 -phosphate of NADPH (Fig. 1). The TG1 cells that were the host of the plasmids containing the KARI genes also have a wild-type chromosomal copy of the ilvC gene. The chromosomal gene is under the control of the ilvC promoter as regulated by the ilvY activator protein (30). Under normal circumstances, the substrate for the enzyme reaction (acetolactate) binds to the ilvY protein, causing the complex to bind to the ilvC promoter and activating the transcription of the ilvC gene (31). In E. coli, the enzyme that synthesizes acetolactate is controlled allosterically by the intracellular concentration of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As the concentration of these amino acids increases, the concentration of acetolactate drops. Under these circumstances, the rich media used to grow the TG1 cells results in high intracellular concentrations of the branched chain amino acids which in turn depresses the production of acetolactate and ultimately leads to repression of ilvC transcription. In fact, TG1 cells grown in LB media show less than 0.5% of the activity of KARI expressed in the same cells that contain the expression vector we created. This means that all the activity we observe as isolated from the bacteria is due to the protein produced from the transcription of the mutant ilvC gene in the expression plasmid. Initially, we made single mutations of the positively charged amino acids at positions 68, 69, 75, and 76. An initial screening of the target amino acids was done by making single mutations of residue K69 of E. coli KARI to leucine and K75, R68, and R76 to the neutral residue glutamine. In all cases the mutant enzymes were catalytically active. The four mutants were purified by the same method as was the wild-type enzyme. In addition, the DG(H2O) for the R68Q and R76Q mutants was within D 0.7 kcal/mol of the value for the wild type (Table 3). These observations indicated that no gross conformational change of the enzyme or its binding site had occurred. Kinetic analysis of these mutated enzymes was carried out to determine changes in Km , kcat , and kcat/Km values for the mutants. Because we were eliminating a charge­charge interaction, we expected to observe a greater than twenty fold change in the kinetic constants for the mutants that were responsible for the electrostatic recognition of NADPH. This estimate is based on the energy necessary to separate two charges in water. The two lysine mutants K69L and K75Q did not exhibit any significant changes in the KNADPH with respect to the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). However the KNADPH

for the R68Q and the R76Q mutants indicated moderate increases in this parameter compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. This could indicate that the change associated with the loss of either positive charge decreases the strength of coenzyme binding. The KNADP determinations for the reverse reaction also indicated that R68Q and R76Q mutants had slightly affected the coenzyme binding site. The kNADPH values for the R68Q cat and R76Q mutants decreased drastically as compared to the wild-type enzyme, and the specificity ratio (kcat/ Km)NADPH for the R68Q and R76Q mutants dropped 62and 100-fold, respectively, compared to the wild-type enzyme. The altered efficiencies of the two mutants with NADPH reflect changes in both kNADPH and KNADPH cat for the two mutants. The (kcat/Km)NADP for the reverse reaction dropped drastically for the two mutants R68Q and R76Q compared to the wild-type enzyme. In order to assess the inherent affinity of each mutant for NADPH, we examined the competitive inhibition of NADPH with respect to NADP. KiNADPH is a dissociation constant for the ErNADPH complex. Comparing the KiNADPH value for the wild-type with that of the R76Q mutant confirmed that the arginine to glutamine mutation had altered the affinity of the enzyme for binding NADPH, while the R68Q mutation had slightly affected the enzyme's affinity for NADPH. This is evidenced by an almost 20-fold increase in KiNADPH for the R76Q mutant and a 7-fold increase in KiNADPH for the R68Q mutant, when compared to the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). The replacement of the two positively charged arginine residues with a neutral glutamine could have affected the electrostatic interaction between the 2 -phosphate of the adenosine ribose and the arginine residues. However, the change of arginine to glutamine could still allow hydrogen bonding interactions between the amino acid side chains and the 2 phosphate. Previous studies on reductoisomerase indicated that the ErNADPH complex undergoes a conformational change on forming the ErNADPHracetolactate complex. The kinetic parameters of R68Q are similar to those of R76Q, but there is a difference in the binding affinities for NADPH. This may occur because the R68 side chain does interact electrostatically with NADPH, but only after the enzyme undergoes a conformational change on forming the ErNADPHracetolactate complex. Hence, the effect of the R68Q mutation on its interaction with NADPH is not reflected in its KiNADPH value. It is clear that the R76Q and R68Q mutants do have altered affinity toward NADPH, but these changes do not specifically select against NADPH as we speculate that the dNH2 group of glutamine could hydrogen bond to the 2 -phosphate of the adenosine ribose. We also assayed the wild-type and mutant enzymes using

FIG. 1. The amino acid sequence of KARI from eight organisms was multiply aligned to identify conserved regions. The GxGxxGxxxG(A) which is the ``signature'' turn region for b ­ a ­ b dinucleotide fold was easily identified. In addition, two ``hydrophobic core'' regions were identified and are indicated by bold face. Based on analogy to other NADPH binding enzymes, we identified two possible dipeptide regions in the E. coli sequence that might be involved in the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme and the 2 -phosphate of NADPH (the f in the figure). These two dipeptide regions were at amino acids 68 and 75 as numbered in the E. coli sequence.

NADH as the coenzyme. However, the KNADH for the mutants was very high and we could not achieve NADH concentration greater than the Km . These results indicate that the replacement of the two arginine residues altered the binding of the natural coenzyme but had not significantly affected the affinity of the enzymes for NADH. To further investigate the role of the arginine residues 68 and 76 in the coenzyme binding, the next round of mutants R76D and R76QR68A were made. Arginine 76 was replaced by a negatively charged aspartate residue. If this arginine is involved in interacting with the 2 -phosphate of the adenosine ribose, then introducing a negatively charged amino acid in

place of the positively charged amino acid would disrupt the electrostatic interaction and cause a charge­ charge repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate and the negatively charged aspartate side chain. As expected, the R76D mutation resulted in a 27-fold increase in KNADPH , while the KNADH was reduced about 3-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme (Table 2). The kcat values were also affected by the R76D mutation. NADH The kcat for R76D increased 48-fold, and the kNADPH cat for R76D decreased 4-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme. Taking kcat/Km as a simple measure of catalytic efficiency, the mutation was judged to cause a 124-fold improvement with NADH as a cofactor and a 110-fold

decrease in efficiency with NADPH as the cofactor when compared to the wild-type enzyme. The consequence of changing a positively charged arginine to a negatively charged aspartic acid residue was that the R76D mutant was changed from being a NADPH-specific dehydrogenase into a NADH specific enzyme. The possibility that R68 was also involved in binding the 2 -phosphate of adenosine ribose could not be ruled out. To test this possibility, the double mutant, R76QR68A, was created. Using NADPH as the coenzyme, the R76QR68A mutation resulted in a 22-fold increase in the KNADPH but no change in the KNADH compared to the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic efficiency of this double mutant decreased 618-fold when NADPH was used as the coenzyme, and it increased 21-fold when NADH was used as a coenzyme, compared to the wildtype enzyme. This dramatic drop in catalytic efficiency of the double mutant when NADPH was used as the coenzyme indicated that both the arginine residues 68 and 76 were involved in interacting with the 2 -phosphate of the adenosine ribose. However the double mutant R76QR68A exhibited a greater than 2-fold increase in KNADH and a 6-fold decrease in (kcat/Km)NADH when compared to the R76D mutant. We attribute this to the negatively charged aspartate that is introduced in place of the positively charged arginine in the R76D mutant. The R76QR68A mutant can possibly hydrogen bond to the 2 -phosphate of the adenosine ribose through the dNH2 of the glutamine side chain, but hydrogen bonding to the 2 -hydroxyl of the adenine ribose of NADH may not be possible. We considered that in the absence of the R76 and R68 residues the two lysine residues, K69 and K75, could possibly stabilize the interaction with NADPH via a secondary electrostatic interaction. A double

mutant K69LR68D was made and then used as the template to make the quadruplet mutant R68DK69LK75VR76D. The K69LR68D mutant was not characterized. The quadruplet mutation resulted in a 28fold increase in KNADPH and a 10-fold decrease in the KNADH when compared to the wild type enzyme (Table NADH 2). The kcat for the quadruplet mutant is 5.3 min01, which is comparable to the kNADPH of 7.2 min01 for cat the wild-type enzyme. The kcat/Km for NADPH is lower by a factor of about 110 relative to the wild type, while the kcat/Km for NADH is increased by a factor of about 530. The ratio of these two contrasting shifts is 58,000, evidence of the profound switch in coenzyme specificity that is achieved. This switch is correlated with changes in side chain charges that result in eliminating the electrostatic attraction between the arginines at positions 76 and 68 with the 2 -phosphate of NADPH and lead to an electrostatic repulsion. Interestingly, the quadruplet was the first mutant enzyme that behaved radically different in terms of purification. This mutant would not bind to a red-agarose affinity column that normally selects for NADPH requiring enzymes. Neither would the mutant bind to a blue-agarose affinity column. These observations suggest that the enzyme may have a much different conformation than the wild-type enzyme; however, the DG(H2O) for this mutant was D nearly identical to that for the wild-type enzyme (Table 3). The quadruplet mutant exhibits a very low KNADH when compared to the wild-type enzyme. This indicates that some interaction is acting to stabilize the ErNADH complex and not merely to destabilize the ErNADPH complex. In NADH-requiring enzymes, carboxylate side chains form hydrogen bonds to the 2 -hy-

droxyl of the adenosine ribose portion of NADH. It is possible that in the quadruplet mutant, some slight conformational changes occur so that the carboxylate side chains of the aspartates at position 68 and 76 can hydrogen bond in this fashion. It is also possible that the two hydrophobic amino acids introduced in the quadruplet mutant affect the stabilization of the ErNADH complex. Since L69 and V75 do not lie in the hydrophobic core of the b ­ a ­ b motif, they do not contribute to hydrophobic interactions that stabilize this fold. It is possible that in the absence of the coenzyme, the apolar valine and leucine are surrounded by water. On addition of the coenzyme to the binding site, water is displaced. This results in an increase in entropy of water, which in turn lowers the free energy of the system and stabilizes the ErNADH complex. In any case, an exact description of the interactions in the quadruplet mutant that act to stabilize the ErNADH complex must await the determination of the X-ray crystal structure.
