Abstract Agmatinase is one of the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyamines such as putrescine and sperimidine from arginine in microorganisms. The gene (PH0083) encoding the putative agmatinase of hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii was identified based on the genome database. The gene was cloned and expressed, and the product was mainly obtained as inactive inclusion body in Escherichia coli. The inclusion body was dissolved in 6 M guanidine­HCl and successively refolded to active enzyme by the dilution of the denaturant. The enzyme exclusively catalyzed the hydrolysis of agmatine, but not arginine. This indicates that PH0083 codes agmatinase. The enzyme required divalent cations such as Co2+, Ca2+ and Mn2+ for the activity. The highest activity was observed under fairly alkaline conditions, like pH 11. The purified recombinant enzyme consisted of four identical subunits with a molecular mass of 110­145 kDa. The enzyme was extremely thermostable: the full activity was retained on heating at 80 8C for 10 min, and a half of the activity was retained by incubation at 90 8C for 10 min. From a typical Michaelis­Menten type kinetics, an apparent K m value for agmatine was determined to be 0.53 mM. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the agmatinase from P. horikoshii does not belong to any clusters of enzymes found in bacteria and eukarya. This is the first description of the presence of archaeal agmatinase and its characteristics. D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Agmatinase (EC 3.5.3.11) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of agmatine to puterscine and is one of the key enzymes in polyamine biosynthesis in bacteria and eukarya [1]. Agmatine is a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of putrescine and longer polyamines, and its important regulatory roles in mammals have been suggested [2­4]. In general, three kinds of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) as the metabolites of agmatine have been widely found in living organisms. An important

chemical characteristic of polyamines is to possess multivalent organic cations in their molecules, and much attention has been paid to their physiological roles in relation to RNA and DNA [5]. In particular, thermophilic microorganisms like Thermus thermophilus HB8 have been reported to possess more than 10 kinds of novel polyamines including two unique branched-chain polyamines [6]. Some polyamines are known to be required for protein synthesis in the cell extract of T. thermophilus, suggesting some special role of polyamines in the protein synthesis of the thermophile [7]. From the special distribution, polyamines in the thermophile may function for the stabilization of macromolecules such as RNA, DNA and acidic proteins at their higher growth temperature [6,8]. In a hyperthemophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, which can grow at much higher temperature than T. thermophilus, unusual polyamines such as N4-aminopropylspermidine and N4-bis(ami-

nopropyl)-spermidine have been found in addition to putrescine, spermidine and spermine [9]. Although the presence of various polyamines has been reported in hyperthermophiles and physiologically important roles have been pointed out, little is known about the biosynthesis and degradation of these compounds in hypethermophilic archaea. Thus, physiological and biochemical analyses about polyamine metabolism and the related enzymes in hyperthermophilic archaea can be expected to give us useful information to find a solution of their special roles in thermophiles. Recently, Kawarabayasi et al. [10] have determined the complete sequence of the genome of P. horikoshii OT-3 and assigned some putative genes related to the polyamine biosynthesis. Our interest in the metabolic pathway of polyamine in hyperthermophilic archaea led us to characterize these gene products. In this study, we performed cloning and expression of the gene PH0083, which was assigned as a gene encoding a putative agmatinase, in Escherichia coli. The characterization of the produced enzyme revealed the presence of the first agmatinase in a hyperthermophilic archaeon.

trypton, 4.8 g of yeast extract, 1 ml of glycerol, 2.5 g of K2HPO4, 0.76 g of KH2PO4, and 10 mg of ampicillin, until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Induction was carried out by the addition of 1.0 mM isopropyl-h-dthiogalactopyranoside to the medium, and then the cultivation was continued for 3 h. 2.3. Refolding and purification of recombinant agmatinase The E. coli transformed cells were collected (1.65 g wet weight), suspended in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM DTT (buffer A) and disrupted by sonication. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000Âg for 20 min at 4 8C. The pellet was solubilized in the 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 6 M GuHCl, 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The solubilized agmatinase was added to the refolding buffer (0.1 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 M arginine, 2 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM PMSF) at 4 8C and was further incubated for about 40 h. Refolded agmatinase was purified by a gel filtration column of Superdex 200 pg (Amersham Bioscience, USA). 2.4. Enzyme assay

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials E. coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL were obtained from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA), respectively. The plasmid DNA pET15b and blood urea nitrogen kit were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI, USA) and Sigma Diagnostics (St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively. 2.2. Cloning and expression of the gene encoding agmatinase The hybrid plasmid DNA (pUAGM) containing PH0083 (positions 67690­69901 in the entire genome of P. horikoshii) was prepared by the insertion of the gene into the HincII site of pUC118 as previously described [10]. The following set of oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify the agmatinase gene fragment by PCR: the first primer (5V-CGGTGGTCATATGCTACTTTACACGTATCGCTCATT-3V) introduced a unique NdeI restriction site overlapping the 5V initiation codon, and the other (5VTCAGGATCCTCACCTAGCACTCATACCTA-3V) introduced a unique BamHI restriction site proximal to the 3V end of the termination codon. Plasmid pUAGM was used as a template. The amplified 0.9-kb fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated with the expression vector pET15b linearized with NdeI and BamHI to generate pEAGM. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL was transformed with pEAGM. The transformants were cultivated at 37 8C in 200 ml of a medium containing 2.4 g of Agmatinase activity was assayed by measuring the formation of urea from agmatine. Urea production was measured by the Sigma Diagnostics urea nitrogen determination procedure no. 535-B. The assay mixture consisted of 100 mM Gly-NaOH (pH 11.3), 20 mM CoCl2, and 20 mM agmatine in a total volume of 50 Al. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 50 8C for 3 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation at 50 8C for 5 min, a solution (950 Al) of blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-535-B containing 7/12 BUN acid reagent and 5/12 BUN color reagent was added to the mixture. The reaction solution was incubated in a boiledwater bath for 10 min, and then in a cold-water (ice-water) bath for 3 min. The absorbance at 526 nm was measured, and water was used as the reference sample instead of the substrate. The amount of urea produced was determined from a standard curve. One unit of agmatinase activity was defined as the amount that catalyzes the formation of 1 Amol of product/min under the standard assay conditions. The specific activity of the enzyme (unit/mg) was calculated based on the protein concentration estimated by the method of Bradford [11], with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The divalent cation requirement for the activity was examined by the addition of 20 mM CoCl2, CaCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2 or MgCl2 to the standard assay mixture. 2.5. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, 15% acrylamide slab gel, 1 mm thick) was performed by the

procedure of Laemmli [12]. The protein band was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. 2.6. Molecular mass determination

for the inhibitor was determined from the replot of the slopes vs. inhibitor concentration.

3. Results and discussion The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was determined by analytical gel filtration on Superdex 200 pg (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 M NaCl. Bovine thyroid thyroglobulin (670 kDa), horse spleen ferritin (440 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and bovine pancreas ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) in Gel Filtration Calibration Kits (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular mass standards. The subunit molecular mass of the purified enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE. The marker proteins (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs) used were as follows: fusion of E. coli maltose-binding protein and h-galactosidase (175 kDa), fusion of E. coli maltosebinding protein and paramyosin (83 kDa), bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase (62 kDa), rabbit muscle aldolase (47.4 kDa), bovine milk h-lactoglobulin A (25 kDa), and chicken egg white lysozyme (16.5 kDa). The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was also determined by dynamic light scattering using DynaPro (PROTEIN SOLUTIONS, NJ, USA). 2.7. Effects of temperature, pH and organic solvents on the stability and activity, and kinetic parameters The effect of temperature on enzyme stability was evaluated by the incubation of the enzyme (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) at various temperatures for 10 min. The remaining activity of the aliquot was assayed. The effect of pH on the enzyme activity was examined under the standard assay conditions at 50 8C using a 50 mM acetate buffer, Bis/Tris buffer, Tris/HCl buffer and glycine­NaOH buffer for the pH ranges of 4.0­5.0, 5.5­7.0, 7.5­8.5 and 8.5­12.5, respectively. The effect of organic solvents on enzyme stability was examined by measuring the remaining activity after incubation with the reagents at 50 8C for 10 min. An aliquot of the incubation mixture was withdrawn, and the remaining activity was assayed. The water-miscible organic solvents used were methanol, ethanol, DMSO, and acetonitrile. The Michaelis constants for the substrates were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plots [13] of data obtained from the initial rate of agmatine hydrolysis at 50 8C. 2.8. Effect of putrescine, arginine and ornithine on the enzyme activity The effect of 5 and 10 mM putrescine, arginine or ornithine on the enzyme activity was evaluated under standard assay conditions (reaction mixture: Gly-NaOH, pH 11.3, 20 mM CoCl2 and 20 mM agmatine). The K i value 3.1. Identification of the gene encoding agmatinase The complete sequence of the P. horikoshii genome has been reported by Kawarabayasi et al. [10]. A PH0083 gene (852 bp, a position of 69,041­69,892 on the entire genome) has been annotated as the gene encoding agmatinase (a protein of 283 amino acids with a molecular mass of 31,445 Da). Homology with the amino acid sequence of P. horikoshii putative agmatinase was searched by the GenBank database in the BLAST server. The sequence of P. horikoshii putative agmatinase exhibited homology with those of agmatinases from Bacillus subtilis (32%), E. coli (26%), human (26%) and Streptomyces clavuligerus (33%) [14­18]. In addition, the sequence of P. horikoshii putative agmatinase showed a higher homology with those of the archaeal putative agmatinases of P. abyssi, P. furiosus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Sulfolobus tokodaii derived from their genome sequences than with that of B. subtilis. 3.2. Gene expression and purification of the recombinant enzyme The expression vector (pEAGM) using E. coli as a host cell was constructed by the insertion of the PH0083 gene into pET15b as described in Materials and methods. The cells (1.65 g of wet weight) of E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL transformed with pEAGM were cultured and disrupted by ultrasonication. After the centrifugation (15,000Âg for 20 min at 4 8C) of the cell extract, the precipitant and supernatant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The pattern in the SDS-PAGE showed that the product of the PH0083 gene was mainly produced as a precipitate, indicating that the product was produced as an inclusion body in the cell extract. For the recovery of the inclusion body, the collected precipitate was dissolved in a 6 M GuHCl solution with gentle stirring, and the dissolved protein was added into the refolding buffer (see Materials and methods). The active enzyme was successively recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation, and the efficiency of the refolding was determined to be 67% by calculation based on the absorbance at 280 nm [19]. The refolded PH0083 product was further purified by gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), and highly efficient purification was achieved: about 45 mg of the purified enzyme (PH0083 product) was obtained from 200 ml of E. coli culture. Therefore, we succeeded in the achievement of the high-yield production system of the enzyme.

(B) Molecular mass of P. horikoshii agmatinase. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was determined by analytical gel filtration on superdex 200 pg as described under Materials and methods.

3.3. Characteristics of the PH0083 product The biochemical characteristics of the purified enzyme were determined. The SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme gave a single band. The subunit molecular mass was determined to be ~31 kDa and consistent with the molecular mass calculated from the amino acid sequence (31,445 Da). The molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined to be about 145 kDa by the gel filtration (Fig. 1B) and 110 kDa by dynamic light scattering method. This indicates that the enzyme consists of four subunits with identical molecular mass. E. coli agmatinase has a dimer structure composed of two identical subunits [20]. Therefore, the P. horikoshii enzyme is the first example of tetrameric agmatinase. This enzyme exclusively catalyzed the hydrolysis of agmatine and did not exhibit any activity for arginine. The enzyme lost its activity by dialysis against a buffer without cations, but the activity was recovered by the addition of divalent cations. CoCl2 was the most effective, and CaCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2 or MgCl2 was replaced to some extent instead of CoCl2. The activity of E. coli agmatinase is known to be most effectively recovered by the addition of Mn ion [21]. Thus, the P. horikoshii enzyme is different from E. coli enzyme in this respect. The optimum pH for the P. horikoshii agmatinase reaction was around pH 11.0 (Fig. 2). Such optimum pH is fairly high compared with those (pH 6.9­8) for Rattus norvegicus, E. coli and Evernia prunastri agmatinase

reactions [18,20,22]. The specific activity of the P. horikoshii enzyme was 1.7 U/mg at 50 8C and pH 11.3. This value is compatible to those of E. coli (specific activity 0.58 U/mg at 37 8C) [20] and E. prunastri agmatinases (1.02 U/mg at 37 8C) [18]. A typical Michaelis­Menten type kinetics was observed for the reaction at 50 8C. The K m value for agmatine was calculated to be 0.53 mM from Lineweaver-Burk plots. This value is smaller than 1.2, 5.3 and 6.4 mM for E. coli, R. norvegicus and E. prunastri agmatinases, respectively, indicating that the P. horikoshii enzyme exhibits higher affinity for agmatine. The effect of temperature on the enzyme activity was examined, and the maximum activity was observed at 100 8C. In addition, the enzyme retained its full activity on heating at 80 8C for 10 min, and 47% activity on heating at 90 8C for 10 min. This indicates that the P. horikoshii enzyme is probably the most thermostable agmatinase so far found, because the enzyme from E. prunastri (the remaining activity: 20% by

incubation at 70 8C for 20 min) has been the most thermostable agmatinase to date [18]. The P. horikoshii enzyme also exhibited high tolerance against some organic solvents. Notable loss of enzyme activity was not observed in the presence of 10% ethanol, methanol, DMSO or acetonitrile at 50 8C. 3.4. Effects of putrescine, arginine and ornithine on the enzyme activity Agmatinase from E. coli is reported to be inhibited by the putrescine, arginine and ornithine [20]. The effect on P. horikoshii enzyme activity by the addition of putrescine, arginine or ornithine was measured. The reaction was remarkably inhibited by putrescine, the product of enzymatic reaction. The inhibition manner by putrescine was a typical competitive inhibition, same as those of human and E. coli agmatinases. The K i value for the competitive inhibition by putrescine was calculated to be 1.8 mM. Arginine and ornithine did not affect P. horikoshii enzymatic activity unlike that of E. coli. This indicates that the P. horikoshii enzyme recognizes only agmatine but not arginine which also exhibits a guanido group. E. coli agmatinase is structurally similar to human arginases I and II and shares highly conserved substratebinding regions with human agmatinase. Iyer et al. [23] have described that seven aspartic acid residues and one histidine residue in the substrate-binding region are necessary for the binding to manganese ions and for the catalytic activity, and such region is well conserved in the arginase superfamily. These results show that the structure of the substrate-binding region of the P. horikoshii enzyme might be different from those of the human and E. coli agmatinases. 3.5. Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequence alignment of the P. horikoshii agmatinase and other agmatinases so far reported (Fig. 3). A phylogenetic tree produced by the UPGMA method shows that the agmatinases are divided into three different clusters. The P. horikoshii agmatinase was clustered with the putative agmatinase from S. tokodaii. This suggests that archaeal agmatinases are divided into a different class from those of other organisms. To date, two different pathways for polyamine synthesis have been reported (Fig. 4). One is the ornithine pathway from arginine to putrescine via ornithine by arginase and ornithine decarboxylase, and the other is the agmatine pathway via agmatine by arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase. It is known that four kinds of enzymes are involved in the two different polyamine synthetic pathways of human, B. subtilis and E. coli, and their arginases have high amino acid and structural similarities

to agmatinases [23­25]. In addition, the results of gene complementation experiments suggest that the two pathways are functionally interchangeable [26]. Sekowska et al. have described that agmatinase is clearly separated from arginase in a sequence similarity tree based on the analysis of the evolutionary relationship between agmatinase and arginase in a ureohydrolase superfamily [27]. This means that the ornithine pathway is likely to have evolved later than the agmatine pathway. We here described the first presence of archaeal agmatinase and its characteristics. The archaea are deeply branched in the phylogenetic tree and are considered to be a domain of phylogenetically ancient organisms. Therefore, the comparison of two putrescine biosynthesis pathways in these organisms may provide us with useful information for the phylogenic analysis of the polyamine biosynthesis. In the entire genome analysis of P. horikoshii, both arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase have been annotated but neither arginase nor ornithine decarboxylase. This suggests that the agmatine pathway is mainly responsible for the polyamine biosynthesis in the case of P. horikoshii, but it is different from those of the human, B. subtilis and E. coli.
