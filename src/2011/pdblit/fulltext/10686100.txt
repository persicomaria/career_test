II~OI>t)LPI(>ri Expression of the biological actiai of cobra neurotoxins is now well docuaented (Chang, 1979) . It is based an specific interactions of the toxin molecules with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, ping a nmdepolarizing neuu~am~scular block in the same manner as claare . In the presence of specific antibodies neunrotoxins do not express their biological activity (Boguet, 1979) . This is well illustrated by the fact that the most effective treatment of systemic cobra bite poisoning is to use specific antivenam (Reid, 1979) . Th}s observation implies that in the presence of specific antibodies the molecular zone of the toxin responsible for the formation of the specific interactions with the physiological target has became inaccessible and/or canformatianally different. Obviously a clear caoprehensim at a molecular level of this problew requires elucidation of both the "toxic" and the .antigenic sites of the toxins . The present paper reports recent results dealing with these aspects in the particular case of toxin a isolated from Naja nigrtcrollis . NEUDIOXINS ISOLATED FIâ)NI

the venom of Naja n3gricrollts obtained from Pasteur Institute contains at least three neurotoxins . The most abundant one was partially sequenced independently by Eaker and Porath (1967) and Kopeyan et al . (1973) who called it toxin a and toxin I, respectively . Recently, in order to localize t~position of a tritiumm label introduced in this toxin (Ménez et al . 1971) we resequenced the latter and confirmed the generally accepted sequence represente~in Fig. 1 (bénez, Barnard and Bhargava, unpublished data) . The second toxin elutes after toxin a an a Biorex 70 column and is called toxin a' (or toxin II) . Its sequence differs from that of toxin a by two single residues at positions 1 and 2 which are Met and Ile (Fryklund and Eaker,1975) (Kopeyan et al ., 1973) . A third tmân which is much less abndant and more basic than the other twoTi --recently been detected in the same venom (Tnémesu and Ménez, unpublished data) . The amino acid campositim of this toxin reveals that it is more closely related to toxin I from N . m . mossambica (Grégoire and Rochat, 1977) . The presence of such a toxin in the N. ntgricollis venom might be of taxanamical importance, however, before airy definite canclusians are made ce this point it will be necessary to confirm that its presence is not due to same artificial heterogeneity of the venom.

Among the 61 amino acids present in the sequ~ce of toodn a (Fig. 1) there are 27 cmserved residue positions throughout the set of homologous toxin sequences, 15 of which are conserved also in other structurally homologous snake venom components strh as cardiotaadns . These are

eight half cysteine residues (at positions 3, 17, 24, 41, 43, 54, 55 and 60), Tyr25, Ile or Val-37, Gly-40, Pro-44, Ile, Val or Leu-50, Thr or Ser-57 and Asn-61 . These residues are probably "structurally" conserved (Rydén et al . 1973) . The additional residues conserved in neurotoxins only are Ser or Thr 8, Lys or -27, Tip-29, Asp-31, His, Phe or Trp-32, Arg-33, Gly-34, Glu or Asp-38, Val or Ala-46, Lys-47, Gly-49, Leu, Ile or Val-52 . These ammo acid residues are considered to be "functionally" conserved. Additionally, depending coi the manner the 65 homologous toxin sequences so far elucidated are aligned, Thr 13 may also appear as a functionally conserved residue (Tamiya et al . 1980) . ao

To cmfirm experimentally the .importance or these invariant residues .for the expression of biological activity of toxin a, several chemical .modifications have been carried out and the consequences moniaored (Faure et al . 1981 . ; Faure et al . in preparatim) . Initially the amino groups of toxin a were acetylate~xîth acetic anTiy3~ according to Hori and Tamiya (1976) . Five derivatives, manoaoetylated at Lys-15, Lys-27, Lys-47, Lys-51 and the N-terminal position were isolated by chromatography . As shown in Table 1 only abolition of the positive charges of Lys-27 and .Lys-47 significantly reduces the affinity of toxin .a for the acetylcholine receptor as estimated from displacemem experiments . This is in agreement with the results obtained with other .taixins (Hori and Tamïya, 1976 ; Tsetlin et al . 1979 . ; Karlssan, 1979) . Secondly the indole sïde chain of Trp-29 of toodn a was t) formy3ätea at the NH group ; ü) modified at C-2 positim with o-nitropherrylsulfenyl chloride . In both cases the reaction products were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain pure monoderivatised toxins . As it is shown in Table 1, intr~oductian of the bulky nitrrophenylsulfenyl group reduces the affinity of toxin a while formylatian has practically no effect . Since all the derivatives modified at the amino or indole group fJ cross-react totally with a complete antisenm prepared against tood.n a ; ü) display C.D . spectra essentially similar to that of native toxin a (Faure et al . in .preparation), it is concluded that their overall configurations are nativelike . TFisEmplies that trie change in affinities observed in table 1 is not äue to indirect conformational modifications but rather is äue to perturbations occurring in the immediate vicinity of the modified group . In conclusion, as the change in affinities of the derivatives modified at Lys-27, Trp -29 and Lys-47 is inca~lete, none of these groups are essential, senses stricto, for the binding of toxin a to the aoetylcholine receptor . Havever they are clearly im~olved in this interaction. It is likely that a similar situation holds for the other "functiaially" conserved residues, implying that the high affinity of toxin a (Kpa10-11I4J

(Weber and Changeinc, 1975) is the result of a cooperative interaction between all these elements and the receptor . At present there is no experimental evidence which ccmtradicts this assumption . Modified residue KD x 10 11 (I4) none 2 N°~ 1 3 15 9 27 29 47 52 51 9 29(formyl) 29(I~S) 7 59

TABLE 1 Affinity constants of the derivatives of toxin a monoacetylated at lysine 15, 27, 47, 51 and at the N-terminal group and formylated or modified with o-nitrophenyLsulfenyl chloride (IBS) at tryptophan 29 . The values are estimated from displacement experiments using tritiated toxin a (45 Ci/mmole) and acetylcholine receptor rich membranes according to Ishikawa et al . (1976) . The question then is how these elements are spatially organized 7 Unfortunately no crystals of toxin a have been obtained as yet. However the X-ray structure of erabutoiYin b, another short neurotoxin possessing 62 residues, has been elucidated in two different laboratories (Low et al . 1976 ; Tsernoglou and Petsko, 1976) . It is particularly significant that in aqueous sTian this toxin has a © spectrum almost identical to that of toxin a (T~nez et al . 1976) . Moreover, structural predictiai analysïs has shown that all short neurotoxins have a similar caifiguratim ressembling that of erabutoxin b (Duftan and Rider, 1977 ; Aënez et al . 1978) . Thus the X-ray structure of erabutoxin b appears to be an adequate representatiaî~ the aro chitecture of toxin a. This being the case it is apparent that with the exoeptian of Ser-8 and Val-46, all the other ten "functionally" conserved residues are distributed an one side of the flat netu^otoxin molecule and that seven of them are aci the central loop of the toxin molecule (Fig . 2) . This therefore is presumably the binding surface of toxin a to the acetylcholine receptor .

The stereochemical arrangement of this reactive zone which is probably comDian to most potent neurotoxins (Lav, 1979 ; ICarlssan, 1979) has been compared to that of several related neuromuscular blacking agents (Duftan and Hider, 1977 ; Hider and Dufton, 1980 ; Tamiya et al . 1980) . In this respect we recently observed (Faure et al . in preparation) that five fmctiona3~y invariant residues of the central loop namely,Zys-27, Trp-29, Asp-31, Arg-33 and Ghr38 together with a variable residue at position 36 (Ile/Val or Arg) are arranged in a quasi-symmetrical mariner with a 'pseudo center" of symmetry lying in the hydrophobic core formed by the indole ring 29 and the hydrophobic core formed by the indole ring 29 and the hydrophobic alkyl group of Ile/Val or trimethylene part of Arg at position 36 . This structure is surprisingly similar to that observed in d-tubocurarine molecule (Fig . 3) eventhough the central loop of the toxin is a little larger . The small deviations existing between the two patterns can be easily elimi nated thanks to the flexible nature of the central loop of the toxine (Ménez et al . 1976 ; Arseniev et al . 1976) and the flexibility of the d-tubocurarine molecule itse~eynolds et al . 1975)Tt should also be stz,essed that the caiformational adjustments required for a bétter fit of the patterns shown in Fig. 3 concern the side chains of the toxin rather than its backbone . As such the curare analogue site of the ta~xin does not involve all the functionally invariant residues . In particular the positive charge of Lys-47 is excluded . However, it is kno~m that tris-cerium compounds, such as gallamine, are more potent neuran>scular blocking agents than the corresponding molecules possessing only one or two opium groups (Stenlake, 1963) . We suggest therefore, that the distances between the 3 positives charges in the toxin are similar to those in the flexible gallarmne molecule . The roles of the other neurotoxic residues carmot be described as yet. THE ANTIGENIC SITES OF
NAJA NIGRIGIDLLIS

TOXIN a

Using a reference horse antivenom of x. nigricolZia (Pasteur Inst .) as precipitating imnxne serum Boquet and co-workers (1977, 1979) analyzed the quantitative precipitation of six homologous neurotoaâns and proposed that part of the central loop and in particular, residues 35, 36 and 37 could form an immunological active zone of toxin a. Using the same reference antivenom Boulain, 1979 & Mênez et al . 1979 have developed a radioimmunoassay using tritium labeller toxin a and studied the cross-reactia>s of ten hanologous short neurotoxins . The observed change in crass-reactivities was then correlated to the differences in amino acid sequences between toxin a and the homologous toxin under study. On this basis 15 amino acid residues were proprosed to be involved in the antigenic structure of toxin a while 11 others were considered to be excluded . Information for the remaining residues was lacking. As shown in Fig. 4 the antigenic residues appear to be distributed on the three ß-sheet loops of the toxin, on the fourth smaller loop and of tTie large turn joining the first and central loops .

In agreement with Boquet's view, the tip of the central loop seems to form part of the antigenic structure of the toxin. It should be stressed that the long ß-sheet str~d 25-30 in the central loop appears to be excluded frwn the antigenic zones. This emphasizes the general impression that the antigenic areas are mostly located oar the protruding and most exposed regions of the relatively planar toxin molecule . This extended distribution agrees well with the finding that four antibody molecules can be simultaneously bound to sie toxin molecule (Boulain, 1979 ; Ménez et al . 1979) . As defined here the antigenic structure remains approximate and no particular epitape emerges fran it . Clearly, a new approach was required to identify individual epitopes and the recently introduced technique of cell fusion (Kt~ler and Milstein, 1975) seemed ideal since the resulting mmoclonal antibodies would be specific for a single antigenic determinant . This procedure has been used to prepare monoclonal antibodies directed against toxin a. The technical data of these experiments will be published with details elsewhere (Boulain et a1 .1981) . In brief, 2 ug, 10 pg and 20 ug of toxin a were injected suabcutaneously in the presence ~Freund's o adjuvent into Balb c mice at two weekly intervals and are month after the last injection, 20 ug of polyacetylated toxin a was injected i .p . Four days later are mouse was sacrified and the spleen removed. 108 spleen cells were mixed with 10 myelama cells (X 63 NS) for fusion (Köhler and Milstein, 1975) . Occurrence of antitoxin a was tested by radiobinding assays and in the case of positive response the hybridana cells were cloned and then grown intraperitoneally in Balb c mice . Ascites fluids rich in antitoxin a antibodies were withdrawn and filtered thrrn~ a toxin a-Sepharose 4B cohmm. Bound antibodies were eluted at piI 2 and coaicentrated finally in 0 .5 M NaCl at neutral PH . A single ha®ogeneous antibody population, so called I~1 has been extensively studied (Boulaïn et al . 1981 ; Ménez et al . 1981) . It corresponds to mouse Ig2A isotype aced binds to tritiated toxin a with hig~u affinity ~CD = 0.35 nt~ as estimated from the slope of the straight line derived from tüe binding data plotted according to Scatchard . This antibody population neutralizes the biological activity of toxin a under both in vivo and ~n vitro conditions : a15 molar excess of the antibody inhibits the toxic effect of 3 ug toxin a (= LD100) and, as shown in Fig . 5 the antibody neutralizes the binding of tritiated toxin a to the acetylcholiee receptorprepared fran electric fish according to Sobel et al . (1977) .

Binding of 3I-I-toxin a to the acetylcholine receptor in the presence of varying amounts of .manoclaial amibody I~1 . Acetylcholine receptor-rich membranes (0 .28 nM) were incubated with tritiated taxi :n (0 .09 nM) together with various amounts of antibody for 24 hrs at 4° The mixtures were filtered through Millipore filters and the bound radioactivity was counted. Bath measure ment was made in triplicate . The curve was calculated ass~ing that the receptor and the antibody simply compete for the toxin with affinity cmstants of 0 .02 nM and 0 .1 nM, respectively . Similar results were obtained when the period of incubation was 72 hrs .

the epitope of toxin a to which I~~ binds has been localized an the basis of cross-reaction experiments using five masioace lated derivatives of toxin a mentiaied above, namely at Lys-15, Lys-27, Lys-47, Lys-51 and at N-terminal group and toxin a' . The results obtained are shown in Fig. 6. Change ïn cross-reactivities are observed with the monoacetylated N-terminal and Lys-15 derivatives only . Thus, modificatia~s of residues 1 and 2 as it occurs in taoän a' and of

10 0

A. 2~NEZ et aZ .

ire residues at positions 27, 47 and 51 do not alter the antigenicity of toxin a towards clearly indicating that all these residues are excluded fran the antigt~ic zone . In contrast, thé two positive charges at the N-terminal position and lysine 15 appear to be antigenically important functions . Inspectitai of a molecular model of the toxin (see Fig . 2) indicates that the epitope is therefore located at the base of the first ß-sheet loop . In order to further define this locality an adtüti~al experiment was carried out with toxin II (or a) of IV .n .oxiana (Grishin et al . 1973 ; .4rnberg et al . 1974) . This protein has a caifiguratiai similar to that of N . niyricollis toxin a (Bystrov et al . 1978 ; Tsetlin et al . 1979) but differs from the and latter at eight positions, namely 1~,~, 30, 45, 50, 51,6 - 59 . The last seven residues are well separated from the base of the first ß-sheet loop and thus the lack of cross-reactivity reported in Fig. 7 probably results fran the substitution occurring at positita( 18 (Pro ~ Ser) .

The experimental conditions are identical to those of Fig . 6 . Finally, as Thr16 is in close .praacimity to both the N-terminal positive charge and lysine 15 we further suggest that this residue is also imrolved in the epitope . Thus the epitope involves at least four groups which are represented in Fig. 8 . The preliminary description of the antigenic structure of ta~xin a is totally in agreement with these findings . Effectively, residues 15, 16 and 18 were considered to be antigenically important while residue 2 was not (see Fig.4) .

ODNCLUSIO~f The total antigenic structure of N .nigricollis toxin a overlaps with the toxic site of the molecule and therefore aorta the toxin is bound to a maximmm (four) of antibody molecules it will no longer bind to its physiological target . Havever such overlapping is not an absolute requirement of the neutralization process, as a single antibody molecule which binds to an antigenic site structurally distinct from the "toxic" site still neutralizes the toxin biological acticar (Figs . 2 and 8) . Several possibilities can be offered to explain this inhibition (i) for steric reasoa~s the small toxin molecule caamot be simultaneously botmd to the receptor and antibody molecules ; (ü) the toxin bound to the antibody molecule adopts a conformation which is not reco~ized by the receptor . We are currently preparing more monoclonal antibodies, with a view to further verifying the ideas outlined in this report . REFERENCES Arnberg, H., D. Faker, L. Fryklund, and E .
