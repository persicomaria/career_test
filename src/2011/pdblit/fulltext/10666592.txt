The structure of xylose isomerase (XyI) from Streptomyces diastaticus No. 7 strain M1033 (SDXyI) has been re®ned at Ê 1.85 A resolution to conventional and free R factors of 0.166 and 0.219, respectively. SDXyI was crystallized in space group P21212, with unit-cell parameters a = 87.976, b = 98.836, Ê c = 93.927 A. One dimer of the tetrametric molecule is found in each asymmetric unit. Each monomer consists of two domains: a large N-terminal domain (residues 1±320), containing a parallel eight-stranded / barrel, and a small C-terminal loop (residues 321±387), containing ®ve helices linked by random coil. The four monomers are essentially identical in the tetramer, possessing non-crystallographic 222 symmetry with one twofold axis essentially coincident with the crystallographic twofold axis in the space group P21212, which may explain why the diffraction pattern has strong pseudoI222 symmetry even at medium resolution. The crystal structures of XyIs from different bacterial strains, especially from Streptomyces, are similar. The 2 helix of the / barrel has a different position in the structures of different XyIs. The conformation of C-terminal fragment 357±364 in the SDXyI structure has a small number of differences to that of other XyIs. Two Co2+ ions rather than Mg2+ ions exist in the active site of the SDXyI structure; SDXyI seems to prefer to bind Co2+ ions rather than Mg2+ ions.

1. Introduction
Xylose isomerase (XyI; E.C. 5.3.1.5) has been extensively studied in several laboratories. The enzyme was widely found in a number of bacteria and catalyzes the isomerization of d-xylose to d-xylulose in vivo. The practical signi®cance of the enzyme stems from its ability to isomerize d-glucose to d-fructose under certain conditions in vitro; therefore, the enzyme is often referred to as glucose isomerase and utilized in industry for the production of high-fructose corn syrup. In addition to its commercial importance, XyI is interesting as a protein model for the study of the structure±function relationships of biomacromolecules, particularly for kinetic studies, since the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is a singlesubstrate/single-product interconversion and the turnover rate for the substrate is relatively low. Moreover, XyI is a metal-ion dependent enzyme. Mg2+, Co2+ and Mn2+ ions activate the enzyme, whereas Ni2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+ ions do not (Callens et al., 1986; Danno, 1970). The stability of the enzyme also depends on the number and type of divalent metal ions presented. It was shown that addition of one Co2+ ion could enhance the structural stability of S. violaceoruber XyI and that a second Co2+ ion was required for its activity (Callens et al., 1988). The Co2+ ion was better than the Mg2+ ion in protecting the

enzyme against thermal denaturation (Danno, 1971; Callens et al., 1988). It was also found that Co2+ and Mn2+ ions bind to the two sites with a higher af®nity than Mg2+ ions (van Tilbeurgh et al., 1992). In order to understand and explain the reaction mechanism, the crystal structures of XyIs, including native enzymes, complexes bound with different substrates, inhibitors or metal ions and mutants with speci®c amino-acid residues selected, have been solved from different bacterial strains, such as Actinoplanes missouriensis (AM; Rey et al., 1988; Jenkins et al., 1992; Lambeir et al., 1992; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1992), Arthrobacter strain B3728 (AB; Henrick et al., 1989; Collyer et al., 1990), S. olivochromogenes (SO; Farber et al., 1987; Lavie et al., 1994; Allen et al., 1995), S. rubiginosus (SR; Carrell et al., 1984, 1989, 1994; Whitlow et al., 1991), S. albus (SA; Dauter et al., 1990), S. murinus (SM; Rasmussen et al., 1994) and S. diastaticus No. 7 strain M1033 (SD; Zhu et al., 1996). A possible reaction mechanism involving a hydride shift has been proposed (Farber et al., 1987; Collyer et al., 1990; Whitlow et al., 1991; Jenkins et al., 1992; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1992; Carrell et al., 1994). Another mechanism involving an enediol intermediate has also been suggested, similar to that of triose phosphate isomerase (Rose et al., 1969). The XyIs have been reported to be either tetramers or dimers in solution, depending on the source. However, no matter what space group the crystals belong to, the XyIs all exist in a tetrameric form in the crystal structures reported; the monomers in the tetramer are related to each other strictly or approximately by the point group 222. Each monomer consists of an N-terminal major domain folded as an eight-stranded / barrel and a C-terminal minor domain folded as a large loop. There are three types of XyI aggregation in the asymmetric units: monomer (e.g. SRXyI and SAXyI), dimer (e.g. ABXyI, SOXyI and SMXyI) or tetramer (e.g. AMXyI). The monomer of XyI from S. diastaticus No. 7 strain M1033 (SDXyI) consists of 387 amino-acid residues, has a molecular weight of 43 kDa and shows a high sequence homology with the XyIs from other Streptomyces species mentioned above (>90%; Wang et al., 1994). The crystals of SDXyI possess a strong pseudo-I222 symmetry, similar to that of SOXyI (Farber et al., 1987; Lavie et al., 1994). The body centring is obeyed very well at lower resolution, but the diffraction intensities of the body-centred re¯ections become signi®cant at higher diffraction angles. The correct crystallographic space group should be primitive and one of the sub-groups of I222, with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. However, the correct space group could not be con®rmed directly from the diffraction data in our previous paper (Zhu et al., 1996), in which the pseudo-I222 SDXyI structure was determined at Ê 1.9 A resolution in order to supply targets as rapidly as possible for the related site-directed mutagenesis. In other words, the SDXyI structure reported is an averaged structure of the two monomer molecules in the asymmetric unit. Here, we report the crystal structure of the enzyme at higher resoÊ lution (1.85 A) in the correct crystallographic space group, recon®rm the type of metal ions in the active site and the structural details, and provide some comparisons between the

2. Materials and methods
SDXyI was puri®ed and crystallized as reported previously (Zhang et al., 1991). The crystals were grown at room temperature ($293 K) by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion technique from 10 mg mlÀ1 protein solution in 0.02 M Tris±HCl buffer pH 7.5, 1.0 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.001 M CoCl2 equilibrated against 0.02 M Tris±HCl buffer pH 7.5, 2.0 M (NH4)2SO4. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Siemens X200B multiwire area detector mounted on a Rikagu rotating-anode X-ray generator using a copper anode (50 kV, 200 mA) at the National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Beijing. The crystals were very stable in the X-ray beam, allowing the Ê collection of an extensively replicated data set to 1.85 A from a single crystal (the redundancy of the data was about 4.0). The XENGEN software package (Howard et al., 1987) was used for data reduction in space group P222. The datacollection and reduction statistics are shown in Table 1. According to the analysis of the crystallographic symmetry, the correct space group of the SDXyI crystals should be one of the four sub-groups of I222: P21221, P21212, P22121 and P222 Ê (unit-cell parameters a = 87.976, b = 98.836, c = 93.927 A), with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The averaged structure of the enzyme monomers re®ned in pseudo-I222 was used as the starting model, with the deletion of metal ions and water molecules and the assignment of temperature factors of Ê 15.0 A2 to all atoms. The initial positions of four possible

dimers in the asymmetric unit were generated from this model by applying the transformation matrices between the pseudospace group I222 and the space groups P21221, P21212, P22121 Ê and P222. Using the data with Fobs > 2.0'(Fobs) to 1.85 A resolution, all four dimers produced were subjected to È re®nement by X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992a). A test data set containing 10% of the re¯ections was selected and reserved for the calculation and examination of a free R factor (Rfree; È Brunger, 1992b) throughout the re®nement process. Loose non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were utilized in the re®nement of the atomic positions and temperature factors; the atomic positions of side chains were restrained more loosely than those of the main chain. With one cycle of rigid re®nement and two cycles of conventional restrained positional re®nement and individual temperature-factor re®nement, the dimers generated in space groups P21212, P22121, P21221 and P222 gave R factors (Rcryst) and Rfree values of 0.216 and 0.263, 0.308 and 0.369, 0.316 and 0.393, and 0.316 and 0.383, respectively; the dimer generated in space group P21212 gave the lowest Rcryst and Rfree, which were almost 0.1 lower than those generated in the other three space groups; the space group P21212 was therefore selected as the correct one. With the program packages O (Jones et al., 1991) and CHAIN (Sack, 1988), the initial 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps Ê È generated to 1.85 A using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992a) showed that the model ®tted the electron density well except for parts of the side chains, which were rebuilt by hand. 525 water molecules were added using the X-PLOR 3.851 program WATERPICK and were checked individually for their ®t to the 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps at 1.8' cutoff. The 2Fo À Fc map showed that two relatively strong electron-density peaks representing the intrinsic metal ions were clear in each monomer at positions similar to those in the structures of other xylose isomerases. Considering that Mg2+ and Co2+ ions were both used in the crystallization and that the concentration of Mg2+ was ten times higher than that of Co2+, the Mg2+ ions were added as a ®rst trial; in each monomer, one Mg2+ was tetracoordinated and another Mg2+ was hexacoordinated. Further positional and temperature-factor re®nements were performed, resulting in an Rcryst and Rfree of 0.220 and 0.180, respectively. However, the Fo À Fc map at this point still showed strong residual electron-density peaks at the positions of all four Mg2+ ions in the dimer and the temperature factors Ê of all four Mg2+ ions dropped to 2.0 A2; the Mg2+ ions were therefore all replaced by Co2+ ions in the subsequent re®nement process. Three shells of further water molecules were then added and examined. NCS restraints were not utilized in the last two re®nement cycles. The changes in the Rfree value were monitored throughout the re®nement.

group P21212, with unit-cell parameters Ê a = 87.976, b = 98.836, c = 93.927 A and a dimer in the asymmetric unit, leading to ®nal Rcryst and Rfree values of 0.166 and 0.219, Ê respectively, for diffraction data to 1.85 A resolution (Table 1). The accuracy of the atomic positions in the re®ned model was Ê estimated to be about 0.20 A on the basis of the dependence of the Rcryst values on resolution (Luzzati, 1952). All main-chain atoms had satisfactory electron density in the ®nal 2Fo À Fc maps. There were no uninterpretable features on the maps signi®cantly higher than the noise level. However, a few long side chains, especially the charged side chains of lysine residues on the molecular surface, were poorly resolved owing to the poor electron density. Most of the residues have main-chain dihedral angles that lie within or very near the acceptable regions of a Ramanchandran plot (data not shown). Of particular note is Glu185, adjacent to Pro186 which adopts a cis conformation. The average temperature factor for all Ê atoms is 12.54 A2. Generally, there is a close correspondence between the temperature factors of equivalent residues in the two subunits. For the well ordered residues within the active sites of the two subunits, the average temperature factors are 6.77 and Ê 6.56 A2, respectively. The temperature factors of the two Co2+ ions in sites 1 and 2 of subunit Ê A are 16.14 and 10.22 A2, respectively; the Ê temperature factors are 18.03 and 11.02 A2 in sites 1 and 2, respectively, of subunit B. The overall structure of each monomer consists of two domains: a large N-terminal domain (residues 1±320), containing a parallel eight-stranded / barrel, and a small C-terminal loop (residues 321±387), containing ®ve helices linked by random coil (Fig. 2a). There is a dimer in the asymmetric unit; two dimers form a tetramer possessing the non-crystallographic 222 symmetry, with one twofold axis essentially coincident with the crystallographic twofold axis in space group P21212 (Fig. 2b). The model of each monomer in the asymmetric unit was rebuilt independently during re®nement. The r.m.s.

This experimental fact implies that sequence homology. A detailed examination of the r.m.s. the four monomers in the tetramer are essentially identical deviations shows that relatively large differences exist in the and may explain why the diffraction pattern has strong 2 helix (residues 64±81) of the / barrel and a turn-and-coil pseudo-I222 symmetry even at medium resolution.

However, the r.m.s deviations between the 2 chain atoms are 0.90 and 0.89 A, respectively; in other words, helices are larger after applying the best superimposition of C the main differences between the initial and re®ned models positions 3±63 together with C positions 82±320 (also shown are focused on the side-chain atoms. in Table 3). Therefore, it can be concluded that the 2 helix of the / barrel has a different position in different structures. 3.2. Comparison of the SDXyI structure with other XyIs The difference may be caused by the possible ¯exibility of a turn-and-coil region located at residues 58±63; however, it In order to investigate the structure features of all xylose cannot be determined which speci®c amino-acid residue might isomerases, the native structures of ABXyI (Protein Data cause the repositioning of the 2 helix (Fig. 1).

By comparing the residue sequences, it seems that the (the sequences of the seven XyIs are shown in Fig. 1).

The Mg2+, Co2+ and Mn2+ ions activate the isomerization ability of the xylose isomerase. The enzyme has no activity when dialyzed against a solution containing EDTA for 24 h (Callens et al., 1986; Danno, 1970). Callens et al. (1988) reported that the xylose isomerase from S. violaceoruber had less than 10% of its maximum activity with one equivalent of Co2+ ion per monomer and had over 75% of its maximum activity with two equivalents of Co2+ ion per monomer, and that the Co2+ ion was superior to Mg2+ in protecting the enzyme against thermal denaturation. In the course of the

crystallization of SDXyI, the mother liquor contained both Co2+ and Mg2+ ions. The type of metal ions bound to SDXyI could not be identi®ed previously. The identity of the metal ions in the active site was inferred from the magnitudes of the temperature factors and from the peak heights in the electrondensity maps. In the crystal structure previously determined in the pseudo-I222 space group (Zhu et al., 1996), two Mg2+ ions were assigned per monomer in the positions equivalent to those in other xylose isomerases. However, in the correct space group P21212, when two Mg2+ ions were placed in each monomer of the present model, all ions had temperatureÊ factor values below 2.0 A2 after several cycles of temperaturefactor re®nement and there was still strong residual electron density at the metal-ion positions. Therefore, the metal ions were reassigned as Co2+ ions; there was no remaining electron density in the positions where the metal ions occurred and the temperature factors of the four Co2+ ions were all in the range Ê 10±20 A2. The SDXyI seemed to prefer to bind Co2+ ions rather than Mg2+ ions, even though the concentrations of Mg2+ and Co2+ ions were 0.010 M and 0.001 M, respectively, in the crystallization solution. The active site of SDXyI has two Co2+ ions ligated by the side chains of seven amino acids which are conserved in all known xylose isomerases; Table 5 gives the bond lengths and Figure 3 angles between the Co2+ ions and their ligands. One metal ion, Superimpositions of the fragment Glu357±Ala364 of SDXyI subunit A Co1, has four carboxylate ligands tetrahedrally donated by the (thick line) and SMXyI (medium line), SRXyI (thin line) and SOXyI carboxylate groups of Glu180, Glu216, Asp244 and Asp286; (dashed line). The plot was produced using CHAIN (Sack, 1988). we do not know what will happen when the substrate binds, as only the native SDXyI structure has been determined. The second metal ion, Co2, has a distorted octahedral coordination and is ligated by three carboxylate groups from Glu216, Asp254 and Asp256, one imidazole of His219 and one water molecule. The distances between the two Co2+ ions in subunits A and B of Ê SDXyI are 4.86 and 4.87 A, respectively. The coordinations of the two metal ions reported in the XyI structures are shown in Table 6. A stereoview of the active site in subunit A of SDXyI is shown in Fig. 4, which is similar to that of the native AMXyI, SOXyI and ABXyI despite the small twist, but differs from that of the native Figure 4 SRXyI (Whitlow et al., 1991; Carrell et al., 1994) Superimpositions of the metal-binding site of SDXyI subunit A (thick line) and ABXyI and SMXyI (Rasmussen et al., 1994), in which the (medium line), SRXyI (thin line) and SOXyI (dashed line).

The possible dimer in solution ligated water molecules. It was found that SDXyI existed as a dimer in solution and that the dimer had catalytic activity (Huang et al., 1992). In principle, the tetramer of SDXyI can be formed by three 3.4. The water molecules in the structure different combinations of dimers in the crystal (Fig. 2). One of There are a total of 636 water molecules in the present them is the `butter¯y' dimer (made by subunit A and subunit SDXyI structure, compared with 396 water molecules in the B; Fig. 2b) similar to the `asymmetric unit' dimer described by previous model obtained in the pseudo-I222 space group. An Lavie et al. (1994). The others are generated by the symmetry approximately equal number of water molecules are assooperators of space group P21212 and are named the `yin±yang' ciated with each monomer, but there are only 23 pairs of water dimer (made by subunit A and an adjacent subunit A; Fig. 2c) and the `diagonal' dimer (made by subunit A and subunit B; Fig. 2d), which are also similar to those described by Lavie et al. (1994). The problem still remains of which of the three possible dimers is the active dimer in solution. The solvent-accessible surface areas of all three SDXyI dimers were calculated using the Ê program X-PLOR with a probe size of 1.6 A. The interface areas between the two monomers of the `butter¯y', `yin±yang' and `diagonal' Ê dimers are 3499, 984 and 3414 A2, respectively; the values were obtained by adding together the solvent-accessible areas of the two monomers of each dimer and then subtracting the solventFigure 5 accessible area of the dimer. Obviously, the `yin± The distribution of water molecules in and around the active-site cleft.

pointed out that xylose isomerase may ®rst aggregate into the `yin±yang' dimer on an increase in concentration (Lavie et al., 1994). However, the monomers related by the crystallographic twofold axis in the `yin±yang' dimer come from the same source; the `yin±yang' dimer may be not a real dimer in solution. The `butter¯y' dimer is the only dimer possessing a intact `high hydrophobic contrast' in the active site (Lavie et al., 1994). Therefore, further experimental evidence needs to be accumulated in order to determine which dimer of SDXyI is the active dimer in solution. Financial support for this project was provided by research grants from National 863 Project, National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules and Chinese Academy of Sciences.
