ABSTRACT:

Proteins of the transferrin family bind, with high affinity, two Fe3+ ions and two CO32- ions but can also bind other metal ions and other anions. In order to find out how the protein structure and its two binding sites adapt to the binding of larger anions, we have determined the crystal structure of oxalate-substituted diferric lactoferrin at 2.4 Å resolution. The final model has a crystallographic R-factor of 0.196 for all data in the range 8.0-2.4 Å. Substitution of oxalate for carbonate does not produce any significant change in the polypeptide folding or domain closure. Both binding sites are perturbed, however, and the effects are different in each. In the C-lobe site the oxalate ion is bound to iron in symmetric 1,2-bidentate fashion whereas in the N-lobe the anion coordination is markedly asymmetric. The difference arises because in each site substitution of the larger anion causes displacement of the arginine that forms one wall of the anion binding site; the movement is different in each case, however, because of different interactions with "second shell" amino acid residues in the binding cleft. These observations provide an explanation for the site inequivalences that accompany the substitution of non-native anions and cations.

Proteins of the transferrin family are known primarily for their metal binding ability. These proteins, which include serum transferrin, ovotransferrin, and lactoferrin, have the property of binding, very tightly but reversibly, two Fe3+ ions per molecule of protein (Brock, 1985; Harris & Aisen, 1989; Baker, 1994). In the case of transferrin at least, this is vital for the uptake of iron by animals and for the maintenance of proper levels of iron in body fluids. The importance of anion binding by transferrins is less obvious but is highlighted by two observations. The first is that Fe3+ ions cannot be bound tightly without the concomitant binding of a suitable anion, normally CO32-. This relationship between anion and cation is synergistic in the sense that each is required for tight binding of the other. Moreover, both kinetic and structural evidence suggests that the anion binds first and prepares the site for metal binding (Cowart et al., 1982; Kojima & Bates, 1981; Baker et al., 1987; Anderson et al., 1989). The second observation that focuses on the importance of anion binding is the structural and functional similarity between transferrins and certain bacterial anion binding proteins (Baker et al., 1987). The site occupied by carbonate in transferrins appears homologous with that occupied by sulfate and phosphate in bacterial periplasmic binding proteins, suggesting that transferrins

could reasonably be thought of as anion binding proteins to which a metal binding functionality has been added (Baker, 1994). The three-dimensional structures of both human lactoferrin (Anderson et al., 1987, 1989) and rabbit transferrin (Bailey et al., 1988) have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The proteins are bilobal, with the N-terminal half of the polypeptide forming one lobe (N-lobe) and the C-terminal half the other (C-lobe). In each lobe the combined metal and anion site is in a deep cleft between two domains (N1 and N2 in the N-lobe, C1 and C2 in the C-lobe). In the native proteins, with Fe3+ and CO32- bound, the two sites are remarkably similar. In each case the metal ion is bound to the same four protein ligands (two Tyr, one His, one Asp) and the CO32- ion bridges between the metal and the protein; it binds in symmetrical bidentate fashion to the Fe3+ ion and forms an exquisite set of hydrogen bonds with an anion binding site on the N2 (or C2) domain. This anion site is formed by the N-terminus of an R-helix (helix 5) and an arginine side chain. Two intriguing questions are raised by the binding properties of transferrins. First, although Fe3+ and CO32are the preferred species bound, and are probably of the greatest physiological significance, many other metal ions and anions can also bind, apparently in the same sites. Among metal ions this includes many di- and trivalent transition metal ions, trivalent lanthanides, other trivalent cations such as Al3+ and Ga3+, and even tetravalent actinides, Th4+ and Pu4+ (reviewed in Baker (1994)]. Likewise many other anions, most of them carboxylate ions (oxalate, malonate, glycolate, etc.), can substitute for carbonate under carbonate-free conditions (Schlabach & Bates, 1975; Baker, © 1996 American Chemical Society

9008 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 28, 1996 1994). The question of how these varying metal ions and anions are bound, and the extent to which they perturb the protein structure, is of fundamental importance to understanding their physiological significance. This is because the ultimate cellular fate of species bound to transferrins depends on receptor binding and hence on the protein conformation. A second question of transferrin chemistry concerns the equivalence of the two sites. Although crystallographic studies show that the N- and C-lobe sites appear essentially identical, when Fe3+ and CO32- are bound, many spectroscopic studies have shown marked inequivalences between the sites when other species are bound. For example, when Cr3+ is bound to either transferrin (Aisen et al., 1969) or lactoferrin (Ainscough et al., 1980) one Cr3+ ion is more readily displaced by Fe3+ than the other. Similarly, when Cu2+ is the metal ion in human lactoferrin (Ainscough et al., 1983), human serum transferrin (Zweier & Aisen, 1977), or ovotransferrin (Zweier, 1980), oxalate is bound preferentially in one site over the other. The origin of these inequivalences is unknown. Given the importance of iron binding physiologically, and the prevalence of many different metabolites (oxalate, glycolate, etc.), which can act as synergistic anions, we present here the crystal structure of a complex of human lactoferrin in which oxalate is used as the synergistic anion, with Fe3+ as the associated cation. This complex, diferric dioxalatolactoferrin [Fe2(C2O4)2Lf], shows how the larger oxalate anion is accommodated in the binding cleft without disturbance of the overall polypeptide structure. It also reveals an unexpected difference in anion binding geometry between the two sites, and this has led, for the first time, to an explanation for the inequivalent behavior of the two sites in terms of the influence of more distant, "second shell", amino acid residues in the binding cleft. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Procedures. All glassware was soaked in nitric acid and thoroughly rinsed with Milli-Q water prior to use, and all buffers were passed through a Bio-Rad Chelex 100 column, 100-200 mesh, to minimize contamination by adventitious metal ions. UV-visible spectra in the range 250-700 nm were recorded using a Hewlett-Packard HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at 110 K, with protein concentrations of approximately 16 mg/mL, using a Varian E 104A spectrophotometer equipped with a Varian E257 variable temperature accessory. Spectral g values were calibrated with (diphenylpicryl)hydrazyl (DPPH) as a standard. Rigorous exclusion of carbonate ions or carbon dioxide was achieved by using standard Schlenk-line techniques (Shriver, 1969). UV spectrophotometer measurements were carried out in dry, argon-filled 1.5 cm cuvettes sealed with rubber septa. EPR tubes were evacuated and back-filled with argon before use. Preparation of Fe2(C2O4)2Lf. Human lactoferrin was prepared from fresh colostrum as described previously (Norris et al., 1989). This gave lactoferrin with a maximum iron content of 8-10% saturation, as estimated from the spectral ratios of A280nm/A466nm and A412nm/A466nm (Aisen &

Leibman, 1972), compared with those of fully iron-saturated lactoferrin (ratios 20-23 and 0.70-0.75, respectively). Apolactoferrin (5 mL) (10 mg/mL, in 0.025 M Tris-HCl, 0.7 M NaCl, pH 8.0) was placed in a Schlenk tube, 6.3 mg of analytical reagent sodium oxalate (BDH) (50-fold excess) was dissolved in the solution, and the pH was gradually lowered to 4.3 with addition of 0.1 M metal-free HCl. Release of CO2 was promoted by subjecting the solution to a small vacuum (10-12 mmHg) over a period of 2 h, during which time the Schlenk tube was intermittently flushed with argon. The pH was restored to 8.0 with CO2-free NH3. Using a spectrophotometer to monitor the titration, 2 µL aliquots of 0.01 M ferric nitrilotriacetate solution were then added to the oxalate/apolactoferrin solution until the saturation point was reached. The resulting complex had a purple-red color, with a visible absorption maximum at 482 nm and a ratio A280nm/ A482nm of 19.0. It was shown to have the EPR spectrum characteristic of the Fe2(C2O4)2Lf complex (Shongwe et al., 1992), and this spectrum also confirmed the absence of any contamination by the corresponding carbonate complex. Crystallization and Data Collection. As Fe2(C2O4)2Lf slowly reverts to the carbonate complex in air, all buffers used for crystallization were subjected to the same repeated evacuation and flushing with argon as the protein solution. Purple-red, needle-shaped crystals, up to 1.2 × 0.6 × 0.6 mm in size, were grown at 4 °C by microdialysis of the protein solution (30 µL, 70 mg/mL protein) against 20 mL of 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 11% (v/v) methanol, in vials that had been back-filled with argon and sealed securely to prevent CO2 contamination. The crystals were orthorhombic, a ) 155.5 Å, b ) 96.9 Å, c ) 55.85 Å, and space group P212121, with one molecule of Fe2(C2O4)2Lf in the asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data to 2.4 Å resolution were collected by screenless Weissenberg photography, using a Weissenberg camera equipped with imaging plates (Sakabe, 1991) at the Photon Factory synchrotron radiation source (Tsukuba, Japan). The camera radius was 430 mm, and the X-ray wavelength used was 1.0 Å. Two data sets were collected, one from a crystal mounted along its a axis and the other from a second crystal mounted along its b axis. In each case a rotation range exceeding 90° was covered; each image covered an oscillation range of 7.0°, with an overlap of 0.5° between successive images giving a total range of 98° for 15 images. Diffraction images were processed using the program WEIS (Higashi, 1989). From a total of 163 844

Oxalate-Substituted Diferric Lactoferrin measured reflections, 31 758 unique reflections with I > I were obtained with an overall merging R value of 0.115. This represents a data set that was 94.9% complete to 2.4 Å resolution (83.3% complete in the outermost, 2.54-2.4 Å, shell, with 50% of the reflections in this shell having I > 2I) (see Table 1). Structure Determination and Refinement. The crystals of Fe2(C2O4)2Lf were isomorphous with those of native diferric lactoferrin, Fe2(CO3)2Lf (Baker & Rumball, 1978). The refined diferric lactoferrin structure (Haridas et al., 1995) was therefore used as the starting model for refinement, after omission of the Fe3+ and CO32- ions, the carbohydrate residues, all solvent molecules, and all protein side chains involved in metal and anion binding. The latter residues were all truncated at C , and all individual temperature factors were given an initial value of 25 Å2. The initial R value was 0.34 for all data in the range 5.0-2.4 Å. Crystallographic refinement was by restrained least squares using the fast Fourier version of PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980). Restraints were applied to bond lengths, interbond angle distances, planar groups, nonbonded contact distances, and chiral volumes. Refinement proceeded in a series of rounds (of 20-30 cycles), during each of which restraints were loosened and then tightened again. Between rounds the model geometry was checked using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), and manual rebuilding from 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc "omit" maps was performed using the interactive graphics program FRODO (Jones, 1978). The Fe3+ ions and the metal ligands were added to the model when the R value was 0.29. After further refinement (R ) 0.28) the two oxalate ions and their associated protein side chains (Thr 117 and Arg 121 in the N-lobe, Thr 461 and Arg 465 in the C-lobe) were built into well-defined electron density. Water molecules were added to the model when the R factor was below 0.25, but only where electron density was seen in both 2Fo - Fc and Fo Fc maps, at levels of 1 and 3, respectively, and the positions made sense in terms of hydrogen-bonded contacts with neighboring atoms. Individual B values were assumed for all atoms when the R factor had dropped below 0.23. The solvent model was reevaluated on a number of occasions (leaving out all water molecules with B > 60 Å2), and special attention was paid to the oxalate ions and associated protein groups which were examined a number of times through omit maps. No carbohydrate residues were included in the model; a diffuse area of positive density extended from the two glycosylation sites, Asn 137 and Asn 478, but it could not be interpreted in terms of individual sugar positions. The final model comprises 5375 protein atoms (residues 4-691), 2 Fe3+ ions, 2 C2O42- ions, and 121 solvent molecules, all treated as water. The R factor for this model is 0.196 for all measured X-ray data in the resolution range 8.0-2.4 Å (31758 reflections), with root-mean-square deviations from standard geometry of 0.018 Å (bond distances) and 0.059 Å (1-3 angle distances). A Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) of the main chain torsion angles (,) shows that 82% of non-glycine residues are in the "most favored" regions defined in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). There are only two outliers, Leu 299 and Leu 642, and as in other lactoferrin structures these have very well-defined electron density; their (,) values are accounted for by the fact that each is the central residue

in a -turn for which the normal (,) values are around (70°, -50°) (Baker & Hubbard, 1984). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Polypeptide Folding. The polypeptide folding of Fe2(C2O4)2Lf is shown in Figure 1, in the form of a ribbon diagram. There are no significant conformational differences from that of native diferric lactoferrin (Haridas et al., 1995). In particular, substitution of the larger oxalate ion for carbonate in each lobe has not significantly altered the closure of the domains over the binding site. Superpositions of the Fe2(C2O4)2Lf structure onto the native Fe2(CO3)2Lf show that the whole molecule superimposes with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.34 Å (687 CR atoms, i.e., the whole polypeptide chain, omitting only the N-terminal residues 1-4, which are not included in the model). Superpositions of smaller components of the structure give root-mean-square deviations that are not significantly smaller: N-lobe, 0.34 Å (325 CR); C-lobe, 0.32 Å (347 CR); N1 domain, 0.34 Å (164 CR); N2 domain, 0.29 Å (160 CR); C1 domain, 0.33 Å (184 CR); C2 domain, 0.28 Å (163 CR). If the closures of the domains of each lobe are compared, as in Smith et al., (1994), the N-lobe of Fe2(C2O4)2Lf is 1.0° more open than that of Fe2(CO3)2Lf and the C-lobe is 0.9° more open. The above results show that binding of the larger oxalate ion in place of carbonate does not change the polypeptide conformation significantly, and any adjustments take place within the binding cleft. Comparisons of iron-bound and iron-free forms of lactoferrin (Anderson et al., 1990; Gerstein et al., 1993) show that large-scale conformational changes, involving rigid body domain rotations, accompany binding and release. As in copper-substituted lactoferrin (Smith et al., 1992) and a hybrid copper-carbonate/oxalate lactoferrin complex (Smith et al., 1994), however, the present structure shows that the domain closure hardly varies and must be determined primarily by the protein interfaces that are buried when closure takes place. The implications are that transferrins carrying ions other than Fe3+ and CO32- could equally well be recognized by receptors. Oxalate Binding. In both N-lobe and C-lobe binding sites the oxalate ion is bound to the Fe3+ ion in 1,2-bidentate fashion as in Figure 2. This provides direct crystallographic support for conclusions also reached from spectroscopic studies (Eaton et al., 1990; Dubach et al., 1991; Mangani &

Messori, 1992). The oxalate ion also makes a series of hydrogen bonds with the residues that comprise the anion binding site on domain 2 of each lobe, in a way that closely resembles carbonate binding. One carboxylate group receives hydrogen bonds from peptide NH groups at the N-terminus of helix 5, together with the side chain OH of Thr 117 (or 461), and the other carboxylate receives hydrogen bonds from the arginine residue (121 or 465) which is present in almost all transferrins (Baker, 1994). These interactions are shown in Figure 2 and are listed in Table 2. The original "interlocking sites" model for synergistic anion binding (Schlabach & Bates, 1975) proposed that anions bound to the metal through an electron donor group L and to a positively charged protein group through a carboxylate group. The crystal structure of a hybrid coppercarbonate/oxalate complex of lactoferrin led to an elaboration of this model, in which the carboxylate group of the synergistic anion binds to the N-terminus of a helix (helix 5) and metal coordination is through both a carboxylate oxygen and the adjacent electron donor group (Shongwe et al., 1992; Smith et al., 1994); the positively charged protein

group, now identified as the arginine, may or may not hydrogen bond to the anion depending on the nature of the substituents on the anion. The present results show that this model (Figure 3) applies equally to both sites and is valid when Fe3+ is the metal ion, just as for Cu2+.

The larger size of the oxalate ion, compared with carbonate, results in some displacement of the arginine side chain, from its position in Fe2(CO3)2Lf. This is achieved through small changes in the side chain torsion angles, 1- 3, in the order of 10-20°, which result in movement of the guanidinium group by 1.0 Å in the N-lobe and 2.9 Å in the C-lobe (measured as the displacement of C ). This movement is made possible by the fact that, in Fe2(CO3)2Lf, in the C-lobe Arg 465 makes no direct interactions with other protein groups, and in the N-lobe Arg 121 makes only one such contact (with Ser 191 OH); the rest of the interdomain cavity into which each arginine projects is filled with readily displaced water. Displacement of the arginine side chain by oxalate does not abolish hydrogen bonding between it and the anion; in the N-lobe both N and N2 remain hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate group, as for carbonate, but in the C-lobe, where the displacement is greater, only N remains hydrogen bonded. The stability of other anion complexes appears to correlate with the size of the anion and its ability to hydrogen bond to the arginine. Glycolate, glyoxylate, and thioglycolate, all of similar size to oxalate (two-carbon framework), cannot hydrogen bond to the arginine while remaining bidentate ligands to the metal and their complexes are less stable (Schlabach & Bates, 1975). Larger (three-carbon) anions give less stable complexes, but of these the most stable are malonate and R-ketomalonate, the only ones able to hydrogen bond with the arginine. Differences between the Sites. The most striking difference between the sites is that in the C-lobe the oxalate binds in symmetrical bidentate fashion (Fe-O bond lengths of 1.91 and 2.07 Å) whereas in the N-lobe the binding is distinctly asymmetric (1.87 and 2.55 Å). Although the resolution of the X-ray analysis is only 2.4 Å, this difference is real; the oxalate positions were checked on a number of occasions during the refinement, through omit maps, and all attempts to impose the expected symmetric configuration on the N-lobe oxalate led to its returning to the asymmetric arrangement on further refinement. The consequences for the iron geometry are that both sites are distorted octahedral but that the long axis of the octahedron differs in each case. In the C-lobe it is the His 597 NE2-Fe-O1 (oxalate) axis

(4.4 Å) whereas in the N-lobe it is the Tyr 92 OH-Fe-O2 (oxalate) axis (4.5 Å); the other axes are all in the order of 3.8 Å. This means that the site symmetries are different and must result in different spectroscopic signals. The differences in oxalate coordination between the two sites are the first structural demonstration of the effects that have been noted in numerous spectroscopic studies when anions other than carbonate are bound. We are now in a position to examine the origin of these site inequivalences. Superpositions of the atoms of the two binding sites (Figure 4) focus on the importance of second shell effects, due to residues beyond the immediate coordination environment. When the larger oxalate ion is bound, the arginine side chain is forced to move, but its movement is different in the two sites. In the C-lobe Arg 465 moves to a position in which it is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with Tyr 398 and Tyr 526 (Figure 4a), and this position is compatible with symmetric binding of the oxalate ion (which remains hydrogen bonded to the arginine). In the N-lobe no such stabilizing hydrogen bonds are possible as the equivalent second shell groups are Phe 63 and Phe 190. Moreover, the arginine, Arg 121, cannot move as far as Arg 465, both

9012 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 28, 1996 because it is restrained by a hydrogen bond to Ser 191 and because it would clash with Phe 183 (equivalent to the much smaller Pro 519 in the C-lobe) and possibly also Phe 63 and Phe 190. The more restricted movement of Arg 121 then leads to a different orientation of the oxalate ion (Figure 4a) and asymmetric iron coordination. The second shell residues, Phe 63, Phe 183, Phe 190, and Ser 191 in the N-lobe, and Tyr 398, Pro 519, Tyr 526, and Gly 527 thus exert different effects on the displaced arginines, through both steric and hydrogen-bonding interactions, and so indirectly determine the anion coordination. Moreover, if it is assumed that symmetric coordination is normally preferred by an oxalate ion, this explains why the C-lobe is the preferred site for oxalate binding by lactoferrin (because it can support symmetric binding). The Metal-Anion Relationship. The synergistic relationship between metal ion and anion means that the effects of metal or anion substitution depend on the identity of the other ion. Thus, when Cu2+ is the metal ion, stable oxalate complexes of lactoferrin can be made by displacement of carbonate from Cu2(CO3)2Lf (Shongwe et al., 1992). The corresponding oxalate complexes cannot be made by displacement when Fe3+ is the metal ion, however, and Fe3+oxalate complexes of lactoferrin are much more prone to reversion. In this context it is really the relative stabilities of oxalate and carbonate complexes that is relevant; since the binding site appears to be optimized for the geometrical requirements of Fe3+ and CO32-, oxalate may not be able to compete well with carbonate when Fe3+ is the metal but can when Cu2+ is bound. The differences in bonding accompanying metal and anion substitution are also emphasized by the visible absorption spectra of the carbonate and oxalate complexes. When Fe3+ is the metal ion, substitution of oxalate for carbonate shifts the visible charge transfer band to lower energy (466 to 482 nm), whereas when Cu2+ is the metal ion, the band is shifted in the opposite direction (434 to 420 nm) (Shongwe et al., 1992). The difference reflects the different types of metal orbitals involved. The visible charge transfer band is assigned as a phenolate  f metal d transition (Gaber et al., 1974; Ainscough et al., 1980), but the lowest available d orbital is of different type for the two metal ions; for d5 Fe3+ it is d* whereas for d9 Cu2+ it is d*. The charge transfer transitions are thus phenolate() f Fe(d*) and phenolate() f Cu(d*). The difference between carbonate and oxalate is that oxalate is a stronger  donor and weaker  donor than carbonate (Gray, 1965; Moeller, 1982). Thus when carbonate is replaced by oxalate, the metal d* orbitals are increased in energy (because d are lowered) and d* are decreased in energy (because d are increased). Thus oxalate substitution should cause a ligand f d* transition (as for Fe3+) to change to lower energy but a ligand f d* transition (as for Cu2+) to increase in energy. This is as observed. The substitution of oxalate for carbonate also affects the metal-tyrosine interaction. This is shown by the fact that the extinction coefficient for the charge transfer band is reduced by over 1000 mol-1 L cm-1, going from Fe2(CO3)2Lf to Fe2(C2O4)2Lf (Shongwe et al., 1992), implying a weakened metal-Tyr interaction. Conclusions. The structure revealed for the Fe2(C2O4)2Lf complex shows that the lactoferrin molecule has sufficient internal flexibility to accept an oxalate ion in each site, in

Baker et al. place of the preferred carbonate, without compromising its normal "closed" structure. The two sites respond differently, however, demonstrating the site inequivalences that arise when a nonpreferred species is bound; this has previously been seen also when Cu2+ is substituted for Fe3+ (Smith et al., 1992). What is clear in the present case is that the way in which each site responds depends on second shell effects, i.e., on residues beyond the immediate coordination sphere; these residues vary from one protein to another, making it likely that other transferrins may respond differently when larger anions are bound. The perturbations, structural and spectral, that are seen when oxalate is substituted also illustrate two key facts of transferrin chemistry. First, the binding sites are optimized for Fe3+ and CO32-, and substitution of a different anion thus alters metal-anion, metal-tyrosine, and anion-protein interactions. Second, the weaker oxalate binding means that the precise mode of coordination is much more strongly influenced by the demands of the protein than is the case with carbonate.
