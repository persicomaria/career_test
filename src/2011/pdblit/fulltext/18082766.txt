ATP-dependent Transcriptional Activation by Bacterial PspF AAA 1 Protein
¨ Jorg Schumacher, Xiaodong Zhang, Susan Jones, Patricia Bordes and Martin Buck*
Department of Biological Sciences, Sir Alexander Fleming Building, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, UK Transcription activation by bacterial s54-dependent enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs) requires their tri-nucleotide hydrolysis to restructure the s54 RNA polymerase (RNAP). EBPs share sequence similarity with guanine nucleotide binding-proteins and ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA) proteins, especially in the mononucleotide binding P-loop fold. Using the phage shock protein F (PspF) EBP, we identify P-loop residues responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, consistent with their roles in other P-loop NTPases. We show the refined low-resolution structure of an EBP, PspF, revealing a hexameric ring organisation characteristic of AAA proteins. Functioning of EBPs involves ATP binding, higher oligomer formation and ATP hydrolysis coupled to the restructuring of the RNAP. This is thought to be a highly coordinated multi-step process, but the nucleotide-driven mechanism of oligomerisation and ATP hydrolysis is little understood. Our kinetic and structural data strongly suggest that three PspF dimers assemble to form a hexamer upon nucleotide binding. During the ATP hydrolysis cycle, both ATP and ADP are bound to oligomeric PspF, in line with a sequential hydrolysis cycle. We identify a putative R-finger, and show its involvement in ATP hydrolysis. Substitution of this arginine residue results in nucleotide-independent formation of hexameric rings, structurally linking the putative R-finger and, by inference, a specific nucleotide interaction to the control of PspF oligomerisation.

Introduction
Transcription of bacterial genes by RNA polymerase (RNAP) involves binding of the polymerase core (a2bb0 v) to a s factor to form an RNAP holoenzyme. Genes transcribed by RNAP bound to s54 factors require activation by specialised enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs).1,2 EBPs hydrolyse nucleotides to restructure s54 RNAP closed complexes, resulting in open promoter complexes competent for transcription.3 ­ 5 Much of our understanding of EBP

functionality comes from the well-studied nitrogen regulator proteins NtrC and NifA, XylR, DmpR and PspF.6,7 EBPs typically are dimers in their ground state but must form higher-order oligomers for high rates of NTP hydrolysis.8 Determinants of nucleotide binding, nucleotide-dependent higherorder oligomer formation, nucleotide hydrolysis and energy coupling to restructure the RNAP closed complex all reside in the catalytic domain of EBPs. However, the molecular mechanism by which nucleotide binding and hydrolysis lead to transcriptional activation is poorly defined. Iterative database searches and sequence alignments classified EBPs into the ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA þ superfamily of proteins), despite sequence identity being below 20%.9 The AAA þ protein family is an extended AAA protein family, including proteins that do not show a second region of

homology (SRH) or AAA minimum consensus sequence. SRH and AAA minimum consensus sequences contain a sensor 1 region that has been proposed to sense the nucleotide status of AAA proteins. However, these regions are poorly defined and make classification to either family ambiguous.10 Higher oligomer formation is required for EBP activity but the functional subunit composition remains a matter of debate, ranging from six to eight protomers. The recently published crystal structures of N-terminally truncated versions of NtrC1 from Aquifex aeolicus and ZraR from Salmonella typhimurium, both homologous to NtrC from Escherichia coli within the AAA þ domain of NtrC, show heptameric and hexameric ring organisations, respectively.10,11 Residues in NtrC and DctD that were predicted to correspond to residues of the Walker A and Walker B motifs were shown to be involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, respectively, and are in agreement with P-loop NTPases.12 ­ 14 The phage shock protein F (PspF) of E. coli regulates the s54-dependent expression of the psp operon, which is involved in the adaptation to various cellular stresses.15 The catalytic domain of PspF (PspF1 ­ 275), truncated for its C-terminal helixturn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain and comprising amino acid residues 1 ­275, binds the ATP hydrolysis transition-state analogue ADP ­ AlFx. ADP ­ AlFx is formed in situ by adding the "trapping" reagents NaF, ADP and AlCl3, resulting in stable higher-order PspF1 ­ 275 oligomers that bind tightly to s54.16 EBP do not readily form stable higher oligomers in the presence of ATP, ADP or the slowly hydrolysing ATP analogue ATPgS.16,17 Initial cryo-electron microscopy (cryo EM) data suggested that the higher oligomeric PspF:ADP ­ AlFx complex forms hexameric rings.18 Oligomer formation and nucleotide hydrolysis are linked but neither oligomerisation determinants nor a mechanistic model that links these two have been elaborated. The EBP signature sequence GAFTGA was proposed to contact s54 and/or be required for productive nucleotide-dependent interactions with s54 RNAP in DctD, NtrC and PspF.6,19,20 Here, we characterise the ATPase activity of PspF and show that Walker A and B residues are required for ATP binding and hydrolysis. We establish by cryo EM that PspF forms hexameric rings in the presence of ADP ­AlFx. The PspF hexameric ring appears to be composed of three dimers, in agreement with kinetic studies of PspF1 ­ 275 ATP hydrolysis. We identify and provide evidence that an arginine residue (R168) is the R-finger required for intersubunit catalysis of nucleotide hydrolysis. Strikingly, substitution of R168 by alanine results in a nucleotide-independent formation of hexameric rings, thereby linking intersubunit nucleotide hydrolysis to oligomerisation in PspF. We estimate three ADP ­AlFx molecules are present in the hexameric structure and demonstrate that ADP and ATP are present in

PspF during hydrolysis, strongly suggesting a sequential ATP hydrolysis cycle for PspF. Based on our structural and functional data, we present a hexameric model of PspF as a basis to discuss the nucleotide-dependent and coordinated molecular activation mechanism of EBPs.

Results
ATP binding and hydrolysis determinants Walker A and Walker B motifs are common to P-loop NTPases. Conserved residues involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis are a lysine (K) of the Walker A motif and a conserved aspartate (D) of the Walker B motif.21 P-loop NTPases often contain a conserved catalytic arginine residue, proposed to protrude from one subunit into the catalytic site of an adjacent subunit so as to interact with the g-phosphate group of ATP at the transition state, offering an explanation for the need for oligomer formation for a high rate of NTP hydrolysis.22,23 Guided by the Neuwald et al. alignment, we substituted K42 (Walker A), D107 (Walker B) and the putative R-finger R168 within box VII of PspF1 ­ 275 with alanine.9 We also substituted another Arg residue within box VII at position 162, which is conserved in EBP, but not in other AAA þ proteins. Substitution of the corresponding arginine residue in NtrC to cysteine resulted in a moderate loss of binding to ATP in the presence of Mg2þ, but a complete loss of ATP hydrolysis.12 The proteins PspFK42A , PspFD107A, PspFR162A and 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 PspFR168A were purified as N-terminal histidine1 ­ 275 tagged fusion proteins on nickel chelating affinity chromatography columns. All proteins eluted as a single peak at 300 mM immidazole, and were soluble and homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE. We assayed ATP binding and hydrolysis of all four mutants to be in the same manner as for PspF1 ­ 275 (Figure 1 and Table 1). Turnover rates of various proteins differed significantly from wild-type (wt) protein, despite identical purification procedures, making it unlikely that the measured rates are due to ATPase contaminants during purification.

The relative [a-32P]ATP to PspF1 ­ 275 was estimated by the phosphorimaging reading compared to the protein amounts in the reactions and is in arbitrary units.

failed to detectably hydrolyse ATP, supporting a role for R168 in catalysis. The observation that PspFR168A is soluble and shows ATP-binding 1 ­ 275 activity suggests that PspFR168A is structurally 1 ­ 275 intact. PspF1 ­ 275 R162A was strongly defective in ATP binding and failed to hydrolyse ATP, evidence that this residue of PspF plays a role in ATP binding rather than hydrolysis. PspF:ADP-AlFx forms hexameric rings The lack of structural information on the subunit organisation of the ATP-hydrolysing domain of EBPs or their exact subunit composition has hindered elaboration of structure­function relationships.8,26 We used ADP ­AlFx to obtain homogeneous samples of PspF:ADP ­AlFx. Analytical gel-filtration analysis of PspF:ADP ­ AlFx showed a single major peak with an apparent molecular mass of 468 kDa, corresponding to 12.67 monomers (data not shown). In the absence of ADP ­ AlFx full-length PspF eluted in the void volume due to aggregation. Aggregated samples could still hydrolyse ATP and aggregation was reversible by adding ADP ­ AlFx, suggesting that nucleotide binding causes structural changes that lead to an active and more soluble subunit arrangement. PspF1 ­ 275 does not show this tendency to aggregate and its apparent molecular mass in the absence of ADP ­AlFx is in agreement with a proposed dimer (Table 1, Figure 2).27 In the presence of ADP ­AlFx, PspF1 ­ 275 eluted as a single symmetrical peak corresponding to a theoretical 11.5-mer showing that some nucleotide-dependent higher oligomerization determinants lie within the s54 activating domain. To determine the subunit arrangement of fulllength PspF bound to ADP ­AlFx, we initially characterised its low-resolution structure by negative staining of samples (Figure 3). The characteristic views from multivariance statistical analysis show that PspF is arranged in a hexameric ring, characteristic of the published structures Eigenimages of other AAA þ proteins.18

Activities are indicated relative to PspF1 ­ 275: þ , ^20%; þ þ at least fourfold increase; 2 at least fivefold decrease. Equal amounts of cross-linked samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (to check that similar amounts of proteins migrated into the gel, see Materials and Methods), followed by phosphorimaging to quantify the radioactivity per protein band. ATP hydrolysis was measured by incubating PspF samples with [a-32P]ATP, followed by separation of ATP and ADP on thin-layer chromatography and phosphorimaging. The apparent subunit composition was determined by analytical gel-filtration analysis.

Measuring ATP binding of EBP has been difficult, apparently because of high ATP turnover and/or high off rates.12,17 PspF1 ­ 275 appears to have a high nucleotide exchange rate, since binding of [g-32P]ATP followed by desalting through G50 MicroSpin columns at 4 8C did not result in radioactivity in the flowthrough, despite the fact that PspF1 ­ 275 does not hydrolyse ATP well at 4 8C (data not shown). To circumvent these problems, we carried out UV cross-linking experiments with [a-32P]ATP in the absence and presence of excess unlabelled ATP or ADP (see Materials and Methods). The UV cross-linking assay is a non-equilibrium binding assay, and will tend to underestimate any ATP binding defects, since the product of the cross-linking does not dissociate or decay readily. Cross-linking methods have been used widely to identify ATP-binding proteins including several AAA proteins.24,25 PspFK42A failed to detectably cross-link [a-32P]1 ­ 275 ATP (Table 1 and Figure 1), consistent with the role of the lysine side-chain of the Walker A motif in forming salt-bridges with the oxygen atoms of the b and g phosphate groups of ATP.21 Walker B mutant protein PspFD107A binds ATP but does not 1 ­ 275 hydrolyse it (Table 1 and Figure 1), confirming the role of D107 as catalytic residue. Notably, the Walker B mutant protein PspFD107A cross-links 1 ­ 275 [a-32P]ATP four times more readily than nonmutant PspF1 ­ 275. An increased apparent affinity for ATP has also been observed for NtrC carrying the corresponding D to A substitution, suggesting that, in line with the findings with NtrC, D107 is required for Mg2þ coordination in PspF.12 PspFK42A and PspFD107A were fully defective for 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 nucleotide-dependent activation of in vitro transcription (data not shown), as expected for proteins with important changes in Walker A and Walker B motifs, and in full agreement with AAA þ proteins. PspFR168A clearly bound ATP as PspF1 ­ 275 but 1 ­ 275

arrangement could represent a different state, because of the presence of ADP ­AlFx, which mimics the transition state at the point of ATP hydrolysis, whereas the structures of HslU, NSF, p97 and RuvB were obtained in the presence of either ATP or ADP. Interestingly, different views and the dimensions of the PspF:ADP­ AlFx particles suggest that two hexamers stack together, forming a barrel-shaped structure with a large central cage (Figure 8, A3 and A4).18 It is possible that further oligomerisation occurs through a dimerization event via the HTH domain, similar to that observed in NtrC.32 Although we do not know the physiological relevance of this double ring structure for PspF, in the presence of trapping reagents it was shown to be functional for s54 binding.16 The stacking of two hexameric rings explains the dodecameric composition seen in gel-filtration experiments and excludes the possibility that double hexameric rings only form during sample preparation for electron microscopy. Nucleotide-dependent subunit assembly into hexamers Higher-order oligomer formation of AAA þ proteins is thought to be a pre-requisite for a high level of ATP hydrolysis. Correlations between the formation of higher oligomers (from NtrC dimers) and NtrC ATPase activity supported the idea that oligomerisation is important for ATP hydrolysis.8 However, nucleotide-dependent subunit assembly (as occurs with ADP ­AlFx) and oligomerisation determinants are poorly understood for EBPs.

(Figure 3B) and rotational symmetry analysis clearly identify a 3/6-fold symmetry (Figure 3E) for PspF:ADP­ AlFx. Therefore, PspF appears to organise as a trimer of dimers instead of the symmetrical hexamer as shown for other AAA þ proteins including HslU, NSF, p97, and RuvB.22,28 ­ 31 PspF could therefore represent a significantly different class of AAA þ proteins utilising a possible different mode of action and of ring assembly. Alternatively, the trimer of dimer

measured the concentration dependency of PspF and PspF1 ­ 275 ATPase activity and quantified turnover. ATP turnover of PspF is constant with respect to protein concentration (Figure 4A), whereas PspF1 ­ 275 activity is strongly concentration dependent (Figure 4A). ATPase activities of PspF and PspF1 ­ 275 increased linearly between 0.1 mM and 4 mM ATP concentrations and were constant over time (data not shown). The sigmoidal curve obtained when plotting the PspF1 ­ 275 concentration against turnover, with a threshold at 0.4 mM PspF1 ­ 275, is maintained at different ATP concentration (from 0.2 mM to 4 mM, data not shown). We infer that the sigmoidal curve observed is due to self-association of PspF1 ­ 275 to form active oligomers. This is in agreement with the concentration-dependent tendency of PspF1 ­ 275 to selfassociate, shown by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis.27 We infer from these observations that higher oligomer formation is essential for high ATPase activity of PspF. These results imply that full-length PspF must already exist in a higher oligomeric form capable of hydrolysing ATP, even at low concentrations. Therefore, the HTH domain is likely to contribute to self-association although nucleotide-dependent formation of stable hexameric rings appears to be orchestrated by the AAA þ domain. To estimate how many PspF1 ­ 275 subunits might have to associate for ATP hydrolysis, we determined the Hill coefficient by plotting the relative turnover of ATP against PspF1 ­ 275 concentration (Figure 4B). We carried out several independent titration experiments to obtain a larger data set between 0.4 mM and 1.6 mM, where small pipetting errors result in large ATPase activity variations. We applied a non-parametric bootstrap to the regression coefficient (resampling 10,000 x,y pairs) and found a bootstrap support of 0.6654 for the Hill coefficient of n ¼ 3 (compared to 0.12 for n ¼ 2 and 0.21 for n ¼ 4).47 This analysis strongly suggests that three subunits assemble during ATP turnover to form an ATPase-competent oligomer. In the case of PspF1 ­ 275 this is explained most easily by three dimers assembling to form the highly active hexamer, and is further supported by our structural data (Figures 3 and 8; see Discussion). Hexamer assembly from dimers may be common to s54 activators, whose dimeric character is thought to facilitate DNA-binding sites with dyad-symmetrical half-sites.33 We have estimated the ratio of [8-14C]ADP ­ AlFx per dimer of PspF1 ­ 275 in the dodecameric oligomer. To this end, PspF1 ­ 275 was incubated with NaF, [8-14C]ADP and AlCl3 under conditions where PspF1 ­ 275 forms homogeneous oligomers, as evidenced by the elution of a single symmetrical peak during gel-filtration chromatography (see above). Unbound [8-14C]ADP was separated from PspF1 ­ 275 by a desalting G-50 spin column. We determined protein concentration and radioactivity of the flowthrough. Experiments were carried out several times and PspF1 ­ 275 consistently showed

significantly more radioactivity (, 1000 cpm) than the same experiment with either just dialysis buffer or PspFK42A (30 ­ 50 cpm) (data not shown). 1 ­ 275 We found a ratio of 0.545 ­0.575 of [8-14C]ADP molecules per monomer of PspF 1 ­ 275. There are six potential functional ATP-binding sites per hexameric ring, and assuming no unspecific binding, we conclude only three of the six sites are occupied by the transition-state analogue per hexamer. Interestingly, PspFD107A and PspFR168A 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 showed no detectable [8-14C]ADP ­ AlFx binding in these experiments, possibly due to their failure to adopt an ATP transition-state associated conformation (see Discussion). The failure of PspFD107A 1 ­ 275 to bind ADP ­ AlFx explains why this mutant protein does not form higher oligomers in the presence of trapping reagents. ATP and ADP bind simultaneously during hydrolysis, suggesting a sequential hydrolysis cycle Different models of the ATP hydrolysis cycle have been proposed for AAA þ proteins: synchronised, rotational and sequential.21 The synchronised model proposes that all six subunits of an AAA þ hexamer bind ATP and that ATP hydrolysis is synchronised, resulting in a hexamer with six ADP molecules bound. As a structural consequence, the hexamer symmetry should be maintained at all times, irrespective of the nucleotide bound. The rotational and sequential models propose simultaneous binding of ATP and ADP to a hexameric assembly, i.e. ATP and ADP are bound at the same time. In order to distinguish between those two types of models, we performed a one-hour time-course of ATP hydrolysis by PspF1 ­ 275 with either [a-32P]ATP or [g-32P]ATP. Since more conventional nucleotide-binding methods like micro-filtration do not work with PspF due to a high nucleotide off-rate, we determined nucleotide binding by UV cross-linking and measured ATP depletion of the same sample by thin-layer chromatography. Different timepoints contained different ATP/ADP ratios and the differently labelled isotopes allowed distinction between ATP-bound ([g-32P]ATP) and ATP þ ADP ([a-32P]ATP) bound states. As described by the synchronised model, the [g-32P]ATP cross-linking signal should be maximal at 100% ATP and decrease as ATP hydrolyses. The [a-32P]ATP cross-linking signal should also be maximal at 100% ATP and either decrease during ATP depletion or remain constant in the case where ADP binds to PspF1 ­ 275 as well as ATP does. For the second type of model for ATP hydrolysis, ATP and ADP should be bound simultaneously and UV cross-linking should result in the strongest radioactive signal when ATP and ADP are present together and when using [a-32P]ATP. When using [g-32P]ATP, the cross-linking signal should decrease as more ATP is hydrolysed and Pi is released. The latter is observed as shown in Figure 5A (open squares).

stoichiometrically to PspF1 ­ 275. This is in agreement with the observation that ATPase activity of PspF1 ­ 275 halves when incubated with equimolar ADP, suggesting a similar Kd of PspF1 ­ 275 for ADP and ATP (Figure 5B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ATP hydrolysis cycle of PspF cannot be synchronised but must be either rotational or sequential. Nucleotide-independent self-association of PspFR168A 1 ­ 275 Stable oligomer formation of PspF1 ­ 275 was observed in the presence of the transition-state analogue ADP ­AlFx, but not in the presence of ATP, ADP or the slowly hydrolysable ATPgS. Because the R-finger could provide all or part of a structural rationale for the requirement of higher oligomer formation needed for high nucleotide hydrolysis rates, we tested whether PspFR168A 1 ­ 275 could form higher oligomers in the presence of ADP ­ AlFx using native PAGE (Figure 6). Surprisingly, PspFR168A, irrespective of ADP ­AlFx, 1 ­ 275 had a significantly slower native gel mobility than PspF1 ­ 275 in the absence of ADP ­AlFx (Figure 6 compare lanes 1 and 7), suggesting nucleotideindependent oligomerisation. The doublet observed in lanes 7 and 8 may be due to two different conformers of PspFR168A. The observation 1 ­ 275 that PspFR168A cross-links ATP as well as 1 ­ 275 PspF1 ­ 275 suggests that PspFR168A is structurally 1 ­ 275 intact. We confirmed the nucleotide-independent higher-order oligomeric state of PspFR168A by gel1 ­ 275 filtration chromatography, resulting in a single peak with an apparent molecular subunit composition of 6.2 (Figure 2). This might explain the faster native gel mobility of PspFR168A compared to 1 ­ 275 the dodecameric PspF:ADP ­ AlFx (Figure 6, lane 2). Clearly, PspFR168A forms stable hexamers in the 1 ­ 275 absence of added nucleotide. Electron micrographs of negatively stained PspFR168A show ring-shaped 1 ­ 275 hexameric particles (Figure 7), very similar in size and shape to the top view of PspF1 ­ 275:ADP ­ AlFx

The relative turnover rates in percentage of PspF1 ­ 275 in the absence of ADP are plotted against ADP concentrations.

When using [a-32P]ATP (Figure 5A diamonds) an increase in cross-linked radioactive nucleotides was found (compared to cross-linked nucleotide at time zero when less than 20% of ATP is hydrolysed) with a maximum when approximately 40% of ATP is hydrolysed to ADP and Pi. Therefore, both ADP and ATP must be bound to PspF1 ­ 275 during hydrolysis. We could not obtain data points where only ATP was present, due to residual ATP hydrolysis during UV cross-linking. The crosslinking signal decreases as more and more ATP is depleted but remains constant even when over 90% of the initial ATP is hydrolysed (later points, data not shown), which must be due to [a-32P]ADP cross-linking, showing that ADP remains bound to PspF1 ­ 275. The signal obtained when 42% of ATP is hydrolysed is almost twice as strong as the signal when most of ATP is consumed, suggesting that ATP and ADP bind

(Figure 3). Taken together, we conclude that R168 is not only involved in intersubunit catalysis but is a major determinant regulating higherorder oligomer formation. PspFK42A and PspFD107A 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 show a slightly different mobility on native PAGE (Figure 6) compared to PspF1 ­ 275, which could be a result of different charges in mutant proteins, as the similar mobilities on gel filtration of PspF1 ­ 275, PspFK42A and PspFD107A suggests 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 (Table 1). PspF1 ­ 275 stably binds s54 only in the presence of trapping reagents, possibly because higher oligomer formation is required for stable binding. We tested if PspFR168A, in the presence and absence 1 ­ 275 of ADP ­AlFx, could form stable complexes with s54, similar to the PspF1 ­ 275:ADP ­ AlFx:s54 complex, by native gel electrophoresis.16 No stable interactions with s54 could be detected in this assay, indicating that hexamer formation of PspFR168A is 1 ­ 275 not sufficient to stably bind s54. PspFR168A forms 1 ­ 275 higher oligomers but fails to hydrolyse ATP (Table 1), activate transcription or stably bind to s54 (data not shown). Therefore, hexamer formation is clearly not sufficient for nucleotide hydrolysis nor for stable and productive interactions with s54. 3D reconstruction and model of the PspF oligomer We carried out cryo-electron microscopy singleparticle reconstruction to obtain a preliminary 3D reconstruction of PspF:ADP­AlFx. The cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction was based on over 2000 particles (Figure 8). The dimensions of one PspF:ADP­ AlFx hexameric ring are in agreement with the dimension of other hexameric AAA þ proteins. The published crystal structures of hexameric NSF-D2,29,34 p97-N-D122 and HslU28,35 showed that the conserved domains of AAA þ proteins (the N-terminal a/b folded domain and

the C-terminal a-helical domain) assemble similarly, mediated predominantly by the triangular shapes of the N-terminal domain and with the nucleotide-binding pocket at the interface between subunits.21 Using this constraint, we tentatively modelled six RuvB monomers into our 3D reconstruction of PspF:ADP ­ AlFx. RuvB was chosen because of its similar predicted domain organisations to PspF (AAA þ domain plus a DNAbinding domain) and closely related functional properties.18,30 An RuvB hexamer based on the HslU hexamer was initially positioned into our EM density map. Significant repositioning of the three dimers was required to accommodate the trimeric property of the PspF density. The s54 protein binds at or close to the GAFTGA signature sequence of s54 activators.20 Our fitting puts the equivalent of GAFTGA in RuvB at the lower surface near the centre, well positioned for a direct s54 interaction. Because of the repositioning of the individual monomers, only one of the P-loops is positioned close to R-fingers from the adjacent protomer. The overall fold, the position of the GAFTGA motif, the P-loop and R residues within box VII of the Neuwald alignment and the protomer interfaces of our model are in full agreement with the recently published crystal structure of NtrC1C.10

ATP Hydrolysis by s54-dependent Activators

Discussion
EBPs and AAA 1 proteins EBP have been classified as AAA þ proteins based on sequence similarities.9 Sequence identities between the catalytic domains of EBP and other AAA þ members are below 20%. The most highly conserved regions are Walker A and B motifs, both involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, we have shown properties of the mutant proteins PspFK42A (Walker A) and PspFD107A 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 (Walker B) that fully agree with the postulated roles for the related residues in other AAA þ members, i.e. Walker A is required for ATP binding and Walker B is required for ATP hydrolysis. Similar findings with DctD and NtrC support a common mechanism of ATP binding and hydrolysis of these motifs between EBP and other AAA þ members.6,13 The recent structural data showed that PspF, NtrC1 and ZraA organise into higher oligomeric rings, as hexamers in the cases of PspF and ZraA and as heptamer for NtrC1.10,11 The dimensions of the oligomeric ring structures agree with that of hexamers from other AAA þ proteins, including NSF, involved in various membrane fusion events29 and the DNA helicase in Holliday junction resolution, RuvB.30 Functional and structural results therefore now firmly place EBP in the AAA þ family. The SRH, sometimes referred to as AAA minimal consensus sequence, which overlaps region VII as described by the Neuwald alignment contains a conserved arginine residue. This arginine residue has been well described for G proteins36 to function as a catalytic residue which protrudes from one protomer into the active site of an adjacent protomer, but has only recently been suggested to be involved in intersubunit catalysis in AAA þ protein members.22,37 For PspF, the putative R-finger is at position 168 and we showed that PspFR168A binds ATP but lacks ATPase 1 ­ 275 activity, in agreement with findings in other AAA þ protein members.22,38 The R-finger we identify in PspF is conserved in the EBP family in the so-called C6 region of sequence conservation.39 The distinguishing feature of AAA proteins (as opposed to AAA þ ) is the presence of a weakly defined SRH. The most defining residues within the SRH region are a conserved threonine (T) followed by an asparagine (N) upstream of the R-finger. The proposed role of the "TN" residues, referred to as sensor 1 residues, is to sense the presence of nucleotide and relay this information to the remainder of the protein.23 EBP PspF, XylR and NtrC1 from A. aeolicus have both these residues, whereas NtrC and DmpR lack the asparagine and DctD lacks asparagine residues and threonine. PspF, XylR and NtrC1 from A. aeolicus may qualify as AAA proteins, since they show a degenerate form of the SRH.23 Other s54 activators do not. Variations in the SRH may be associated with different subclasses of EBPs.

PspF assembly into functional hexameric rings and sequential hydrolysis mechanism In their active state, most AAA þ members are hexameric rings, which assemble from monomers40 or dimers41 upon nucleotide binding or are already hexameric in their ground state.22 The crystal structures of a number of AAA þ proteins show that the catalytic site lies at the interface of the subunits. The reported numbers of nucleotides bound per hexamer varies from six to two, depending on the particular nucleotide and protein combinations studied and several models have been proposed.21 Hexamer formation is a unifying feature of AAA þ proteins and a pre-requisite for activity.12 The R-finger functioning as catalytic residue between subunits may provide a mechanistic rationale for the requirement of oligomerisation for ATPase activity. formation of The ADP ­ AlFx-dependent dodecamer complexes of PspF1 ­ 275 supports the view that important nucleotide-dependent higher oligomer determinants lie within the catalytic domain of s54 activators.42 Based on the results presented here, we propose the following nucleotide-triggered oligomerisation mechanism for PspF. ATP binding of dimeric PspF1 ­ 275 induces structural changes required for oligomerisation. Several independent lines of evidence support this mechanism: (i) because ATP hydrolysis requires higher oligomer formation, oligomerisation and ATP hydrolysis can be correlated. A Hill coefficient of 3.1 with respect to PspF1 ­ 275 concentration and irrespective of ATP concentration strongly supports the idea that three subunits have to assemble for ATPase activity. (ii) The estimated binding of one ADP ­AlFx per PspF dimer resulting in stable oligomers. (iii) A trimer of dimer arrangement seen in the hexameric ring structure of PspF suggesting a heterogeneous nucleotide occupancy between protomers. However, we cannot distinguish if one ADP ­ AlFx binds to one dimer and bridges between dimers (Figure 8, as between the red and green monomers), or if ADP ­ AlFx binds between two protomers of a dimer (Figure 8, as between the red and orange monomers), thereby changing the dimer conformation and allowing for higher oligomer formation. Given the observations in other AAA þ proteins, that nucleotides were bound in-between subunits and sub-domains, it is likely that the tightly associated dimers in the PspF structure contain the bound nucleotide, while the loose associations between the dimer units could be through other interactions. ADP­AlFx is a transition-state analogue of ATP at the point of hydrolysis, and we found three ADP ­ AlFx molecules per hexamer, making it unlikely that PspF hydrolyses six ATP molecules simultaneously, as proposed for a synchronised ATP hydrolysis cycle. Rather, the ADP ­ AlFx data indicate a sequential or rotational cycle.21 UV crosslinking experiments in the presence of either [a-32P]ATP or [g-32P]ATP support the simultaneous

binding of ATP and ADP during hydrolysis and exclude a synchronised ATP hydrolysis cycle. This is further supported by the trimer of dimer assembly of PspF, as described by the synchronised hydrolysis model, where the hexamer symmetry is maintained throughout the cycle.21 Open complex formation by the s54 RNAP complex proceeds via several intermediate states, involving large conformational changes in the RNAP promoter complex.41 This process requires the coordinated interplay between s54 activators and RNAP promoter complex. A sequential ATP hydrolysis cycle for PspF would allow for several distinctive ATP bound states (as opposed to a synchronised cycle), which might reflect different intermediate states during initiation of transcription. Although PspFD107 and PspFR168A bind ATP well, they failed 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 to stably bind ADP ­AlFx. One explanation would be that higher oligomer formation is needed to stabilise the protein ADP ­AlFx complex and that mutant proteins simply fail to form stable oligomers. However, this seems unlikely, since PspFR168A is already in a higher oligomeric state. It 1 ­ 275 could also be that the in situ formation of ADP ­ AlFx is catalysed by the ATP hydrolysis site and that mutant proteins fail to do so, possibly because they can not adopt a conformation which represents the protein conformation at the transition state of ATP hydrolysis. Alternatively, if formation of ADP ­AlFx occurs independent of the active catalytic site, mutant proteins could be incapable of adopting the transition-state conformation required to stably bind the transition-state analogue. We favour the last explanation, since R-fingers have been found to directly stabilise the transition state of hydrolysis, whereas the D of Walker A is likely to coordinate Mg2þ, which in turn is also involved in hydrolysis.43,44 Nucleotide-independent hexamerisation, a role of the R-finger Our finding that PspFR168A forms ring-shaped 1 ­ 275 hexamers independent of ADP ­ AlFx, strongly links R168 to intermolecular interactions that are otherwise nucleotide dependent. For PspF, the R-finger appears to have a dual role, in the absence of nucleotide it prevents higher oligomer formation while in the presence of ADP ­ AlFx it is likely to contribute to higher oligomer formation. As described by our model (Figure 8), R168 and the corresponding R in other AAA þ member structures, is located at the centre of the subunit interface. This arrangement is evident in the crystal structure of NtrC1, where R299 (R168 in PspF) is located at the interface between protomers and in close vicinity to the catalytic site.10 However, oligomeric PspFR168A failed to hydrolyse ATP, bind 1 ­ 275 stably to s54 or activate transcription. The structure of ATP-bound HslU with a substitution of the R-finger to E (R325E) is nearly identical with nonmutant HslU bound to ATP but exhibited complete loss of protease and ATPase activity.38 No

substitution of the R-finger among the AAA þ proteins has been reported to promote nucleotideindependent oligomerisation and PspF may be a special case. We have observed that full-length PspFR168A also forms nucleotide-independent hexamers, suggesting that hexamerisation of PspFR168A 1 ­ 275 is not facilitated by the absence of the HTH domain (J.S. & M.B., unpublished results). Hexameric ring formation is not sufficient for stable s54 binding per se, since we could not detect PspFR168A binding 1 ­ 275 to s54. Determinants of PspFR168A required for s54 1 ­ 275 binding probably depend on conformational changes that occur after ATP binding. This is supported by the observation that fragments of PspF containing motifs predicted to interact with s54 specifically bind to s54, whereas PspF1 ­ 275 requires the presence of nucleotide.20 PspF as molecular machine s54 regulators have been described as molecular machines, since nucleotide hydrolysis is required for open complex formation by the s54 RNA polymerase, a polymerase conformation that is disfavoured both thermodynamically and kinetically.5,45 Therefore, ATP hydrolysis is coupled to direct contacts between PspF and its substrate, which in turn is required to restructure the s54/ promoter complex and cause transcriptional activation. We infer that the energy released at the point of breakage of the ATP b ­ g phosphate bond is coupled to some restructuring of the s54/ promoter complex. The EBP signature GAFTGA motif was shown to directly contact s54 and was suggested to be involved in energy coupling.6,19,20,46 In the hexameric model of PspF presented here, the GAFTGA motif is predicted to lie at the inner circumference and at the surface (Figure 8) of the ring, well placed to contact s54 and participate in energy coupling. Comparison between PspF and NtrC1 The recently published crystal structure of NtrC1, truncated for its C-terminal HTH and N-terminal receiver domain (NtrC1C), reveals a heptameric ring structure.10 The packing of these AAA þ domains in the heptameric ring resembles the packing of other AAA þ proteins like HslU and RuvB.30,35 However, the heptameric nature of NtrC1C alters the angles between protomers slightly compared to HslU and RuvB, making it difficult to fit the NtrC1C structure into our hexameric structure of PspF. We also modelled the full-length PspF structure based on the crystal structure of RuvB, because it allowed us to model the HTH motif of full-length PspF into the RuvB structure. Visual comparison between our model and the structure of the NtrC1 central domain structure confirms the conservation of the overall fold, the subunit interfaces, the position of Walker A and B motifs, the R- finger and the GAFTGA motif.

872 The ADP-harbouring catalytic site of NtrC1C is comprised of residues of Walker A and B motifs of one protomer and completed by residues from the adjacent protomer in the heptamer. Notably, R299 and R293 (R168 and R162 in PspF) protrude from one subunit towards the bound ADP in the adjacent subunit. Although all sidechain amino groups of R299 and R293 are over ° 4 A distant from the b-phosphate group of ADP, reorientation of the R side-chains in the presence of ATP make them likely candidates for catalytic side-chains. We have shown here that the predicted R-finger of PspF (R168) is required for ATP hydrolysis but not ATP binding. The NtrC1C structure provides structural support for a direct role of R168 in ATP hydrolysis. R162 of PspF could perform a similar role, judged by the position of R293 in NtrC1C, although we found PspFR162A to be strongly 1 ­ 275 affected in ATP binding. R162 of PspF is not conserved in AAA þ proteins but in EBP and a substitution of the corresponding amino acid in NtrC (R294) of E. coli to cysteine resulted in only a minor decrease in Mg2þ ATP binding and a complete loss of ATPase activity.12 Therefore, R294 of NtrC may play a catalytic function in NtrC. However, the role of the two R residues in region VII of EBP may not be the same in all EBPs. NtrC requires phosphorylation of the receiver domain for higher oligomer formation and the receiver domain is likely to be involved in the packing of the higher oligomeric form,6 whereas the AAA þ domains of PspF, ZraA and NtrC1C suffice to form hexamers and heptamers, respectively.10,11,18 This difference may contribute to minor differences in the packing of protomers that could have important effects on the atomic geometry of the catalytic site. It would be interesting to know what role the corresponding residue of R168 of PspF plays in other EBPs. Many AAA þ proteins, like RuvB and MCM involved in Holliday branch migration and DNA replication, respectively, bind and process DNA.30 In those cases, single or double-stranded DNA penetrates the inner pore of the hexameric rings. Using the RuvB structure to model PspF, including the HTH domain, positions this domain on the opposite side of the GAFTGA motif and on the periphery of the hexameric ring (Figure 8). This is in agreement with the position of the C terminus of NtrC1C, which lacks the C-terminal 52 amino acid residues.10 Although the HTH domains of PspF and RuvB bind DNA, DNA binding seem to play very different roles and the modes of binding may be different. RuvB requires the HTH domain for its helicase activity, which is dependent on nucleotide hydrolysis.30 In contrast, PspF does not require its HTH domain for activity in vivo or in vitro, and nucleotide hydrolysis is used to restructure the s54 bound to promoter DNA. Also, it is not clear for PspF if DNA penetrates the inner hole of the ring, because the GAFTGA motif binds specifically to s54 during transcriptional activation

and binding would interfere with the presence of UAS DNA.8

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and protein purification Plasmid pPB1 encodes E. coli PspF residues 1 ­ 275 (PspF1 ­ 275) with an N-terminal 6-His tag in pET28bþ, purified as described.16 pPB1 was mutagenised (Quickchange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) to obtain PspFK42A , 1 ­ 275 PspFD107A, PspFR162A and PspFR168A. Mutant proteins 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 1 ­ 275 were over-expressed and purified as for PspF1 ­ 275. Fulllength PspF (freshly prepared) and s54 were purified as described.5,13 ATP binding and hydrolysis ATP-binding assays of PspF1 ­ 275 mutant proteins by UV cross-linking were as described.24 Briefly, 20 ml samples containing 3.4 mg of purified protein in reaction buffer A (35 mM Tris ­ acetate (pH 8), 70 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 19 mM ammonium acetate, 0.7 mM DTT) contained 40 mCi of [a-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) ^ 3 mM ATP or ADP. Samples were illuminated (254 nm, UVG-54, UVP Inc., CA) for 15 minutes on ice. The protein was precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone and analysed by SDS-12% PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue, dried and radioactivity determined by phosphorimaging (Fuji Bas-1500 with Tina 2.10g software). The amount of protein per band was estimated by light transmission scanning of the Coomassie blue-stained gel to verify that protein amounts were comparable in each band. To measure ATP and/or ADP binding to PspF1 ­ 275, we incubated 20 mM protein with either 20 mM (40 mCi) [a-32P]ATP or (40 mCi) [g-32P]ATP at room temperature and extracted samples at different time-points over an hour. Samples were rapidly brought to 2 20 8C to stop hydrolysis. Sample drops were spotted onto a 4 8C cooled glass plate and exposed to UV light as above. After cross-linking, samples were analysed by SDSPAGE as above. Before and after cross-linking, samples from the drops were taken for analysis on thin-layer chromatography to measure the amount of total ATP hydrolysed (see below). Comparison of the ATP/ADP ratios before and after UV cross-linking revealed residual ATPase activity during light exposure, probably because samples were heated by the light. ATPase assays were in reaction buffer A (above), incubated for one hour at 30 8C with 4 mM [a-32P]ATP containing 0.06 mCi/ml. ATPase activity in the presence of ADP was measured by adding ADP to the indicated final concentrations before the addition of ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding five volumes of 2 M formic acid. Released 32Pi or [a-32P]ADP was separated from ATP by thin-layer chromatography and radiolabelled Pi, ADP and ATP amounts measured by phosphorimaging (Fuji Bas-1500, Tina 2.10g software).49 Gel-filtration and analysis of ADP ­AlFx complexes The apparent molecular masses of PspF, PspF1 ­ 275 ADP ­ AlFx and PspFR168A in the absence and presence of 1 ­ 275 ADP ­ AlFx were estimated by analytical HPLC gelfiltration chromatography on Biosep 3000 (Phenomenex)

Native PAGE was carried out as described.13 Samples and molecular mass standards were dialysed against Tris ­ HCl (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, prior to loading. To determine the PspF1 ­ 275:ADP­ AlFx ratio, PspF1 ­ 275 ­ ADP ­AlFx was formed in the presence of [8-14C]ADP, filtered through G-50 size-exclusion MicroSpin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.), the protein concentration determined (Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit), and the radioactivity determined by scintillation counting (BDH scintillation cocktail EX-2, LKB Wallac, model 1219 liquid scintillation spectrometer). Final concentrations in the ADP ­ AlFx reactions were: 30 mM PspF1 ­ 275, 25 mM Tris ­ acetate at pH 8.0, 8 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM [8-14C]ADP (4 mCi/ml, by mixing ADP and [8-14C]ADP (57 mCi/mmol; ICN)).

Electron microscopy For structural analysis, highly purified (. 96% as judged by Coomassie and silver staining) PspF (30 mM final) was complexed with ADP ­ AlFx13 with 250 mM NaCl and without PEG, to maintain full-length PspF solubility and as required for electron microscopy, respectively. Purified PspFR168A was dialysed against 1 ­ 275 Tris ­ HCl (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol. Freshly prepared PspF:ADP ­AlFx or PspFR168A were 1 ­ 275 diluted into 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8), 75 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2 to , 50 mg/ml. They were then either negatively stained in 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate on collodion-coated grids supporting a carbon film, after glow-discharge in air or applied to washed, glow-discharged copper grids supporting a lacey carbon film (Agar Scientific, UK). The latter was blotted and quench-frozen in liquid ethane cooled at 2 186 8C by liquid nitrogen. The grid was transferred into a Gatan 626 cryo-holder, inserted into the microscope (CM200, FEI for PspF:ADP­ AlFx; CM100 for PspFR168A) and maintained at 2 168 8C during 1 ­ 275 observation. For PspF:ADP­ AlFx negatively stained samples, the grid was observed at 50,000£ in a CM200 FEI microscope operating at 160 kV. For PspFR168A 1 ­ 275 negatively stained samples, the grid was observed at 52,000£ in a CM 100 FEI microscope operating at 80 kV. The micrographs were recorded under low electron dose conditions and digitised using a Leafscan 45 to ° 2.0 A per pixel. For cryo-cooled samples, micrographs were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV at a nominal magnification of 38,000£ on Kodak SO163 film ° under minimal electron dose illumination (10 e2/A2). Selected micrographs were digitised with a Leafscan 45 ° scanner (Leaf Systems Inc.) to 2.6 A per pixel. Image processing was performed using the IMAGIC-5 software.48 The centred (non-rotationally aligned) images were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis implemented in IMAGIC-5 giving rise to a first set of averages and the eigenimages were inspected for information about the rotational symmetry. A set of references was extracted after this first cycle of classification for the initial round of multi-reference alignment. Iterations of
