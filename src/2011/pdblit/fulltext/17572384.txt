Abstract Human p55, the major palmitoylated protein associated with the cytoplasmic face of the erythrocyte membrane, is believed to modulate interactions between protein 4.1 and glycophorin C. It is the prototype of a newly described family of signaling molecules that includes hDlg, the human homologue of the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein. Chronic myeloid leukemia is characterized by transformation to a fulminating acute leukemia, heralded by evolution of the Philadelphia chromosome positive genotype (Ph +) to further abnormalities. RT-PCR of p55 mRNA from a patient with acute megakaryoblastic CML revealed a 69 base pair deletion in the PDZ domain, corresponding to exon 5 of the p55 gene. The deletion of constitutive exon 5 not only marks the first abnormality of the p55 cDNA in human disease but also the first abnormality of a PDZ domain in human disease and may represent another genetic abnormality associated with CML in blast crisis. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction The primary structure of p55 consists of a PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/ZO-1), an SH3, and a GUK (guanylate kinase-like) domain [1]. Our previous data suggest that p55 may function as an adaptor protein linking protein 4.1 and glycophorin C (GPC), stabilizing membrane-cytoskeletal interactions and cell shape [2]. p55 binds to the C-terminus of GPC via its PDZ domain [3]. In a study of GPC expression, Villeval et al. reported an abnormal processing of GPC in human leukemic cells, while Das et al. revealed that the palmitoylation of p55 is significantly decreased in erythrocytes of CML patients compared to normal erythrocytes, possibly modulating p55 function [4,5]. These intriguing observations gave us the impetus to

examine the expression of p55 in CML patients, particularly CML patients in blast crisis. CML represents a severe dyshemopoetic state with many genetic abnormalities. We previously reported a series of 75 CML patients in blast crisis, 52 of who developed new cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to being Ph + [6]. We now report a truncation of the PDZ domain of erythroid p55, caused by the skipping of exon 5, in a patient with acute megakaryoblastic CML. The skipping of exon 5 may represent an abnormal event, in that alternative splicing of p55 mRNA involving exon 5, or any exon for that matter, has never been reported. The mutation of p55 protein may represent yet another genetic abnormality associated with blastic CML. The recent crystal structure determination of the class II PDZ domain of human CASK protein (61% amino acid identity with p55 PDZ) offers insightful clues to the potential deleterious effects of a mutated PDZ domain on p55 function [7].

2. Materials and methods The four patients analyzed in this study were all diagnosed with CML in blast crisis. Total RNA was extracted from these patients and reverse transcribed using oligo-dT and AMV reverse transcriptase. Two overlapping regions of the complete p55 cDNA were PCR-amplified using the primers A1/A2 and B1/B2 (A1 (sense), 5%-TCA AGG CGA GCG AGG GCG AG; A2 (antisense), 5%-GCA AGG GAT CAG ATT GTC CT, spanning 529 bp from exons 1-6; B1 (s), 5%-TCA TTC AGT GGA TCA GCT G; B2 (as), 5'-ATT GAC CAG TGA GAG GTC A, spanning 927 bp from exons 4-12). RT-PCR products were gel-purified (QIAGEN) and directly sequenced in both directions (Pharmacia). Total genomic DNA was extracted from the buffy coat of the patients using QIAamp Blood Kit (QIAGEN). PCR of exon 5 was performed using primer pair C1/C2 (C1 (s), 5%-CCT GGG ACT TTG AAT GAA TGA TCA; C2 (as), 5%-TAT AAG ACA ACA TGG CCC GAC TCC, spanning 200 bp, situated in flanking introns 4 and 5). PCR products were prepared for sequence analysis using the PCR Template Prep for ssDNA sequencing (Pharmacia). PCR of exons 4­ 6 was performed using primer pair D1/D2 (D1 (s), 5%-CCC TTC ACG TGG GGG ATG; D2 (as), 5%-CAA TCC TGC TGA CTC CTT GGA GGA, spanning 323 bp, situated in exons 4 and 6). PCR was performed on human adult reticulocyte cDNA, human fetal brain cDNA (Clontech), and on the Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel c2 (Clontech). Reticulocyte cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA using random primers. All tissue cDNAs were pooled from multiple individuals ranging from two (small intestines) to 550 individuals (peripheral blood leukocyte).

PCR analysis of p55 exons 4­6 revealed a single transcript of 323 bp from ten different tissues representative of 657 individuals (Fig. 2). This indicates that of the tissues examined, p55 transcripts lacking exon 5 do not exist, including during development (fetal brain). p55 transcripts were detected in all tissues examined, including in the spleen and thymus, two nonerythroid tissues involved in hematopoiesis (Fig. 2).

4. Discussion and conclusion PDZ domains, like SH2 and SH3 domains, mediate specific protein-protein interactions and were first identified in a novel family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like homologues (MAGUK) [9]. A common theme is emerging that links MAGUK proteins to the C-terminal ends of transmembrane proteins via their PDZ domains. Based on their primary sequence, PDZ domains are divided into two classes [10]. Recently, the crystal structures of both class I and II PDZ domains have been solved and at their core consist of six an-

3. Results Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products generated from the blood of a patient with acute megakaryoblastic CML revealed a 69 bp deletion within the p55 cDNA (Fig. 1). The determination of the structure of the p55 gene revealed that this deletion precisely corresponds to exon 5 of the p55 gene [8]. No other genetic abnormalities within the p55 cDNA were detected in this patient, or in the three other blastic CML patients. Direct sequencing of a 200 bp genomic fragment containing exon 5 revealed no mutations in exon 5, at either exon-intron boundaries (splice junctions), or 110 bp upstream and 25 bp downstream of exon 5. Unfortunately, this patient with an exon 5 deletion died before further study on the p55 and GPC proteins could be carried out.

Amino acids above p55 sequence are residues from the hCASK protein. p55 PDZ shows 61% identity with hCASK PDZ. Identity increases to 68% when only amino acids directly contributing to secondary structure are examined. Arrows indicate location of exon­intron boundaries. Exon 5, deleted in a patient with blastic CML, is highlighted.

tiparallel i-strands organized into a i-barrel capped at each end by an h-helix [7,11]. However, the two types of PDZ domains also reveal significant structural differences which likely account for the varying specificity of class I and II PDZs for their target ligands. Class II PDZ domains (p55) have preferential binding for the peptide sequence F/Y-X-F/V/A-COOH (X-any amino acid) [10]. We have recently demonstrated that the PDZ domain of p55 binds to a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 residues of the transmembrane glycoprotein GPC [3]. More specifically, the 3 residues YFI-COOH at the extreme C-terminus have been shown to be critical for the interaction. Interestingly, binding is abolished when 21 amino acids at the N-terminus of the PDZ domain are deleted (aa 62­82) [3]. These amino acids form the first i-strand ([1] of PDZ and contain a highly conserved methionine residue (Met 82) that contributes to the carboxylate binding loop (Fig. 3) [7]. We speculate that loss of this i-strand and Met 82 disrupts the tertiary structure of the PDZ domain abrogating its binding affinity for GPC. The deletion of exon 5 (aa 138­ 152) results in the loss of the last i strand (i6) and residues Lys 138 and Glu 139 of the second h-helix (h2) (Fig. 3) [7]. Residues of h2 form a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the amino acid at the ­ 2 position of the ligand [10]. In the case of p55-GPC interaction, it is possible that the loss of Lys 138 and Glu 139 critically impairs the ability of h2 to form the binding pocket for the tyrosine residue at the ­ 2 position of GPC. Furthermore, the location of the i1 (N-terminus) and i6 (C-terminus) strands of PDZ next to each other, sharing the same face of the i-barrel, suggests that the loss of

the i6 strand would similarly abolish binding of p55 to glycophorin C or to a binding partner as yet unknown [11]. Unfortunately, we could not analyze potentially abnormal p55 protein, or GPC protein, since the patient died prior to identification of the p55 deletion. Although the molecular basis for exon 5 skipping remains unknown, it is possible that a mutation exists further upstream or downstream of exon 5. We believe that exon 5 skipping represents an abnormal genetic event and is not the result of normal mRNA splicing. In fact, there is no evidence of any alternative splicing of the p55 mRNA in the current literature involving p55 or in p55 EST sequences deposited in Genbank. Additionally, PCR screening of more than 650 cDNAs representing ten different tissues indicates a single transcript consisting of exons 4­6 and the absence of any transcript composed of exons 4 and 6 but lacking exon 5 (Fig. 2). We describe the first instance of a potential mutant p55 cDNA, resulting in truncation of the PDZ domain, in a patient with acute megakaryoblastic CML. Whether this deletion contributes to malignancy or is one of many abnormalities resulting from the malignant phenotype remains to be determined. The truncation of PDZ may abolish the binding between p55 and GPC disrupting cytoskeletal-membrane interactions leading to abnormal cell proliferation characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia, especially in blast crisis.
