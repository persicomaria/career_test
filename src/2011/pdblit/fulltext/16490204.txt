Abstract Trypanosoma cruzi chagasin belongs to a recently discovered family of cysteine protease inhibitors found in lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes but not in mammals. Chagasin binds tightly to cruzain, the major lysosomal T. cruzi cysteine protease, involved with infectivity and survival of the parasite in mammalian host cells. In the scope of a project to characterize proteins diferentially expressed during T. cruzi metacyclogenesis, we have determined the crystal structure of chagasin, which is now the Wrst X-ray structure of a chagasin-like cysteine protease inhibitor to be reported. The structure was solved by the SIRAS method and reWned at 1.7 Å resolution and a comparison with the two NMR structures available revealed some diVerences in the loops involved in binding to cysteine proteases. The highly Xexible loop 4 could be entirely modeled and residues 29­33 from loop 2 form a 310-helix structure that may be important to stabilize the loop conformation. Chagasin crystal structure was docked to the highest resolution structure available of cruzain and a model of chagasin-cruzain interaction was analyzed. The knowledge of the chagasin crystal structure may contribute to the elucidation of the molecular mechanism involved in the inhibition of cruzain and other T. cruzi cysteine proteases. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, a human disease aVecting more than 16 million people in Latin America (www.who.int/ctd/chagas). T. cruzi life cycle involves three well deWned developmental stages: epimastigotes, trypomastigotes and amastigotes (De Souza, 1984). The process by which non-infective T. cruzi epimastigotes are transformed into metacyclic trypomastigotes, the pathogenic form, is named metacyclogenesis. In order to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression in T. cruzi as well as the mechanisms of infectivity, we have recently

started a project aiming at the structural and functional characterization of more than 100 proteins diVerentially expressed during metacyclogenesis. Trypanosoma cruzi chagasin belongs to a recently discovered family of inhibitors of cysteine proteases (Monteiro et al., 2001), known as ICP, which was identiWed in some parasitic protozoa, bacteria and Archaea, but not in metazoa. Chagasin binds tightly to cruzain, the main T. cruzi cysteine protease, which belongs to the papain-like clan of cysteine proteases. Cruzain function has been reported to be essential for parasite invasion and intracellular growth in mammalian host (Meirelles et al., 1992; Scharfstein et al., 2000; Aparicio et al., 2004) and the determination of the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of cruzain complexed with an irreversible inhibitor (McGrath et al., 1995) has contributed to the eVorts to develop a new chemotherapy for Chagas' disease. T. cruzi cysteine protease inhibitor chagasin is expressed at

variable levels during the parasite life cycle and recent studies indicated that the balance between the levels of chagasin and of the endogenous cysteine proteases may aVect parasite diVerentiation and infectivity (Santos et al., 2005; Santos et al., 2006 for a review). Cysteine protease inhibitors occur widely in nature and several distinct groups with unrelated primary structures have been identiWed. Currently, 10 families of cysteine proteases inhibitors have been described and implicated in many physiological processes (reviewed in Dubin, 2005; Rzychon et al., 2004). Cystatins remain the best-characterized group, comprising cystatin A, B and C types and, despite of the multitude of structural and functional information available on cysteine protease inhibitors, members of some groups still remain poorly characterized (Dubin, 2005 and Rzychon et al., 2004). Until very recently, there was no experimental data reported on the structural characterization of chagasin-like protease inhibitors, although computer based predictions indicated that chagasin should have an immunoglobulin-like fold and studies on the mode of interaction with cruzain suggested that chagasin would bind to the substrate through three hairpin loops (Rigden et al., 2002). A three-dimensional structure of chagasin solved by nuclear magnetic resonance was reported recently (Salmon et al., 2006). It consists of eight -strands connected by six loops and one 310-helix with the strands organized in two -sheets in an Immunoglobulin-like domain fold. Interaction studies suggested that the so-called loops L2, L4 and L6 are involved with cruzain recognition (Salmon et al., 2006). Loop L4 was poorly deWned both in the chagasin structure in solution and in the NMR structure of the ICP homologue from Leishmania mexicana, which was reported almost simultaneously (Smith et al., 2006). These results conWrm the loop L4 as being highly mobile and sitedirected mutagenesis in L4 showed that the replacement of hydrophobic residues by charged residues and glycines by more structurally restricted residues suppress inhibitory activity (Smith et al., 2006). We present here the Wrst 3D structure of a chagasin-like cysteine protease inhibitor solved by X-ray crystallography. Chagasin structure was determined at 1.7 Å resolution and the Xexible loop L4 could be unequivocally modeled. Chagasin crystal structure was docked to the highest resolution structure available of cruzain and a model for chagasin­cruzain interaction was analyzed. Cysteine proteases of parasitic organisms have been proposed as good targets for rational drug design and the elucidation of the chagasin crystal structure may contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis for interaction between protozoan cysteine proteases and their endogenous inhibitors. 2. Protein production and crystallization The coding sequence of chagasin (NCBI accession: AJ299433) was ampliWed by PCR from T. cruzi Dm28c genomic DNA using oligonucleotides containing NdeI and

BamHI restriction sites (Forward: 5 CAT GCA TAT GTC CCA CAA GGT GAC GAA AGC 3 and reverse: 5 ATG GAT CCT CAG TTT GCC TTG AGA TAT ACA ATG 3 ). The PCR product was inserted into the pGEM-T cloning vector (Promega), the sequence veriWed and subsequently transferred to a modiWed version of the pET28a vector (Novagem), named pET-TEV (Carneiro et al., 2006) using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, producing the vector from now on called pET-TEV/icp. Proteins expressed from pET-TEV contain an N-terminal histidine tag followed by a TEV protease recognition site, so that the histidine tag can be removed by TEV digestion. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) slyD¡ strain (Roof et al., 1994) harboring pET-TEV/icp plasmid was incubated overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing kanamycin (50 g ml¡1). This pre-culture was used to inoculate 1 L of fresh LB-kanamycin medium and incubated at 37 °C up to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of approximately 0.8­0.9. Expression was induced with 0.5 mM of IPTG and the cells were harvested after incubation overnight at 16 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in the start buVer (20 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole). Cell lysis was performed by sonication in a Branson soniWer (Branson Ultrasonics, Co). The cell extract was kept on ice during streptomycin sulfate 2% (w/v) treatment for 45 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove nucleic acid precipitate. Finally, the extract was applied onto a nickel-aYnity column (Hi-Trap Chelating from Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted by an imidazole gradient as described by manufacturer. We obtained »120 mg of pure protein from a 1 L of cell culture. Protein purity was conWrmed by SDS­PAGE and the puriWed protein was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl. Crystallization assays were performed with the protein containing the His-tag fusion. As it was observed, the His-tag did not prevent crystals from growing. Initial crystallization trials were carried out by using the sitting-drop vapor diVusion method at 18 °C with commercially available screens from Hampton Research and Jena Bioscience. First crystals of chagasin were obtained in drops containing equal volumes (2 l) of protein sample (15 mg ml¡1 in 10 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl) and reservoir solution (30% PEG 8000, 100 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and 200 mM ammonium sulfate), equilibrated against 300 l of reservoir solution. Crystallization was further optimized by testing PEG 8000 concentration ranging from 10 to 35% and ammonium sulfate from 100 to 250 mM and by testing also the hanging-drop system. Crystals for data collection (reaching up to 500 m at the maximum dimension) were obtained after two weeks from drops made of 2 l of protein sample (15 mg ml¡1 in 10 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl) mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 15% PEG 8000, 100 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and 100 mM ammonium sulfate. The drops were equilibrated against 300 l of reservoir solution using the hanging-drop vapor-diVusion method.

3. Data collection, structure solution, and reWnement X-ray diVraction data were collected at the protein crystallography beam line D03B-MX1 of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory, LNLS, Campinas, Brazil. Native crystals were cryoprotected by 30% glycerol prior to Xash-cooling in a 100 K nitrogen-gas stream. Iodide derivative (I¡) crystals were obtained by the rapid cryosoaking technique (Dauter et al., 2000). The soaking solution consisted of the mother liquor added by 30% glycerol and 500 mM NaI. Crystals were incubated in the soaking solution for 2 min prior to Xash-cooling. Complete data sets were collected from native and derivative crystals using a MARCCD detector. Data processing and scaling were performed using the programs MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) and SCALA (Kabsch, 1988; Blessing, 1995) from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project 4, 1994). Chagasin native crystals diVract to 1.7 Å resolution and belong to the space group P3112. Data from derivative crystals were required in order to apply isomorphous replacement methods, because extensive attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement methods using the available NMR structures (PDB codes 2C34 and 2FO8) as search models were unsuccessful. Data from I¡ derivative crystals were collected up to 2.3 Å resolution. Crystals belong to the same space group as native crystals with similar unit cell parameters. Matthews coeYcient calculation (Matthews, 1968) indicated the presence of two monomers in the asymmetric unit, giving a VM value of 2.0 Å3 Da¡1 and a solvent content of 37.1%. The structure of chagasin was determined using the SIRAS method. LNLS D03B-MX1 is a monochromatic beam line and, at the experimental setup (wavelength D 1.427 Å), iodide theoretical f value is 6.0243. Nine I¡ sites with occupancies greater than 0.5 were found with the program SHELXD (Sheldrick and Schneider, 2001) using only anomalous data from the derivative crystal. ReWnement of heavy atoms parameters, calculation of phases and density modiWcation were carried out with autoSHARP (Bricogne et al., 2003) using data from native and derivative crystals. Due to data quality and high incorporation of anomalous scatterers, phasing procedure was straightforward and a starting model was automatically built using the program ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999). 20 cycles of autobuilding resulted in four polypeptide chain fragments containing a total of 213 residues (out of 220 expected for two monomers). The model was manually completed using the program Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and structure

reWnement was carried out with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). ReWnement cycles were alternated with visual inspection of the electron density maps and model rebuilding with the program Coot. During the Wnal cycles water molecules were added using the program ARP/wARP. At this point, reWnement converged to Rfactor and Rfree values of 22.4 and 26.1%, respectively. Then we performed Translation/Libration/Screw (TLS) reWnement using TLS groups deWned by the TLSMD server (Painter and Merritt, 2006). After reWnement, the output TLS tensor was applied to the Wnal model through the CCP4 graphical interface. Three TLS groups per monomer were used in reWnement and the

Wnal model presented an Rfactor of 20.5% (Rfree D 23.8%), with good overall stereochemistry. As deWned by the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) all non-glycine and non-proline residues fall in the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Table 1 summarizes data and reWnement statistics. 4. Molecular docking Chagasin monomer was docked to the highest resolution structure available of cruzain (PDB code 1ME4; Huang et al., 2003) using the FTDOCK suite (Gabb et al., 1997).

Water molecules are represented as red spheres. Contacts are essentially the same in both monomers (not shown). (B) Stereo view showing loops L4 (residues 60­69) and L2 (residues 28­34) in detail. Electron density 2Fo-Fc map (yellow) is contoured at 1.4 . The intramolecular hydrogen bond between Gly66 and Asn29 is indicated.

The output was scored using pair potentials (Moont et al., 1999) and the putative complexes were Wltered by the assumption that an inhibitor atom should lie within 5.5 Å of the cruzain catalytic His159. This assumption was based on previously proposed models of direct cysteine protease catalytic site blockage by peptide inhibitors (see discussion bellow). The best ranked complex model was reWned by simulated annealing and molecular dynamics procedures using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Figures were produced using the program Pymol (http:// www.pymol.org) 5. The chagasin crystal structure The Wnal atomic model of chagasin includes two crystallographically independent monomers (labeled A and B) and 190 water molecules. The quality of the electron density allowed modeling of residues 3­110 in monomer A and 2­109 in monomer B (out of 110 residues from the protein sequence). A few highly exposed side chains were poorly deWned by the electron density maps and were replaced by alanines. Loop L4 (residues 59­69), poorly deWned in the NMR structures (Salmon et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2006), was unequivocally modeled in both monomers. Superposition of the symmetrically independent monomers shows no signiWcant structural diVerences and results

in overall rms deviation of 0.50 Å for the 107 common C atoms. Analysis of thermodynamic parameters and interface area between the monomers using the PISA webserver (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html), indicated that the dimer formation was induced by crystallization and has no biological relevance. The interface between the monomers buries a surface of approximately 610 Å2 which corresponds to approximately 10% of the surface area of each monomer. Chagasin monomer is composed of eight -strands and two 310-helix with the strands arranged in two -sheets, in an Ig-like domain fold. As deWned by the program PROMOTIF (Hutchinson and Thornton, 1996.), the chagasin crystal structure shows an additional 310-helix (residues 29­33) not described in the NMR structure (Salmon et al., 2006). Superposition of the chagasin crystal structure and the lowest-energy NMR models of chagasin and of its homologue from L. mexicana resulted in overall rms deviations of 1.88 Å (77 C aligned) and 1.72 Å (83 C aligned), respectively. Main structural diVerences are observed in the loop regions (Fig. 1). In the chagasin crystal structure, loop L4 adopts an intermediate conformation compared with the lowest-energy NMR models. The loop L4 conformation is conserved in both monomers and residues 63­67 participate in crystal contacts, which are mainly mediated by water molecules. The

crystal contacts are essentially the same in both monomers (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the carbonyl group of Gly66 forms a strong intra-molecular H-bond with Asn29 N 2 from loop L2 (Fig. 2B). Asn29 is the Wrst residue of the 310-helix observed in the chagasin crystal structure but not in solution. A turn of 310-helix is also described in L. mexicana ICP in the same region (loop 2, residues 30-32), projecting the side chains of Asn29, Thr31 and Thr32 toward the solvent (Smith et al., 2006). Interestingly, B-factor analysis reveals that the loops proposed to be involved in the binding to cysteine proteases (L2, L4 and L6) show a rather stable conformation (Fig. 3). The highest B-values are found at the end region of loop L3 which is very exposed to the solvent and is not part of the main core of the molecule. In the case of loop L6, it participates in crystal contacts and makes a number of interactions with the crystallographically independent monomer B (not shown). Thus, low B-values could be explained by crystal packing. Nevertheless, since loop L6 has essentially the same conformation described by the solution structures (Fig. 1A), we are led to conclude that the L6 structure observed in the crystallographic model is not due to crystal artifacts. On the other hand, L2 and L4 residues do not interact with monomer B and participate in less degree in crystal packing contacts. Thus, we believe that the formation of the 310-helix (loop L2, residues

29­33) stabilizes the conformation of the highly conserved NPTTG motif (Fig. 1B) and also favors the stabilization of L4 structure, by placing the side chain of Asn29 in position to form an hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Gly66 (Fig. 2B). 6. Chagasin­cruzain complex Docking simulations between the chagasin crystal structure and a high resolution structure of cruzain indicates that chagasin loops L2, L4 and L6 participate in the interaction with the substrate (Fig. 4). The so-called loop L2, whose residues form a 310-helix in the chagasin crystal structure, approaches the cruzain catalytic residues Cys25 and His159 blocking the active site, whereas loop L4 occupies the so-called cysteine peptidases S sites of the active site cleft (Fig. 4). This model of interaction was based on previously proposed mechanisms (Rigden et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2006; Alphey and Hunter, 2006) and is similar to those utilized by the unrelated inhibitors steWn B and the p41 invariant chain fragment. The protease-inhibitor interaction mechanism has been revealed in greater detail following the determination of the crystal structure of the Papain-SteWn B and Cathepsin L-p41complexes (Stubbs et al., 1990; Guncar et al., 1999). Although not structurally related to chagasin-like inhibitors, steWn B and p41 also possess a wedge-shaped conformation with three hairpin loops at one side of the molecule (Stubbs et al., 1990; Guncar et al., 1999). The NMR structures of chagasin and L. mexicana ICP showed a highly Xexible loop L4. In this work, we have observed that the loop L2 region, comprising the highly conserved NPTTG motif, can form a 310-helix structure. Futhermore, the loop L4 conformation, although partially stabilized by crystal contacts, may correspond to a stable interaction intermediate, as shown by the docking simulations. We propose that the binding/unbinding mechanism of chagasin to cysteine proteases may involve structural changes in loops L4 and L2, including fold and unfold of the 310-helix formed by residues 29­33. In conclusion, we expect that the crystal structure of the chagasin-like cysteine protease inhibitor described in this work will contribute to the elucidation of the molecular basis for the interaction between protozoan cysteine proteases and their endogenous inhibitors.
