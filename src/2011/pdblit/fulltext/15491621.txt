The infrared difference spectra between octopus rhodopsin and hmrirhodopsin have been observed at 210 K under irradiation of blue and orange light under neutral conditions. The C=N stretching frequencies of the protonated S&i&base linkage shift upon H/D exchange. The H/D shifts observed in this study for octopus rhodopsin and lumirhodopsin are 25 and 23 cm-`, respectively, whereas those for bovine rhodopsin and lumirhodopsin have been reported to be about 30 and 4cm-`, respectively. These results indicate that environments around the S&Z-base linkage differ between octopus and bovine lumirhodopsin, whereas those of octopus rhodopsin and lumirhodopsin are similar. The relationship between the H/D shift of the C=N stretching band and the hydrogen bond involving the protonated Schiff base is discussed.

Introduction

Rhodopsin is the visual pigment found in many vertebrates and invertebrates. It is a transmembrane protein which contains 11-c&retinal as the chromophore [l-5]. Following the absorption of visible light, 11-c&retinal isomerizes to the all-trans form, and the apoprotein of rhodopsin (opsin) experiences a series of thermal transformation. In this transformation process initiated by light absorption, rhodopsin has several intermediates which are distinguished mainly by the changes in visible absorption. In the case of octopus rhodopsin, the transformation series is known to contain the following steps and intermediates: rhodopsin ---f primerhodopsin +

bathorhodopsin + lumirhodopsin + mesorhodopsin + acid metarhodopsin. Besides these intermediates, there is another species called isorhodopsin, which is photochemically produced from rhodopsin or bathorhodopsin only at a low temperature (77 K). Isorhodopsin contains 9-&-retinal. The photoreaction of bovine rhodopsin is different from that of octopus rhodopsin; for example, the photoreaction of bovine rhodopsin at room temperature leads to hydrolysis of the retinal moiety from the opsin, whereas the final photoproduct of octopus rhodopsin (acid metarhodopsin) is thermally stable and can be phototransformed back to rhodopsin by irradiation of orange light in a neutral condition

changes in opsin. In order to clarify the molecular mechanism of the biological function, it is important to investigate structural changes in each step of the transformation series. Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy is a useful method for such a purpose [7-lo]. For bovine rhodopsin, the difference spectra between bathorhodopsin and rhodopsin, and between isorhodopsin and rhodopsin have been measured by Bagley et al. [ll], and the difference spectrum between lumirhodopsin and rhodopsin has been reported by Ganter et al. [12]. In each difference spectrum, several bands arising from the retinal moiety have been assigned by use of isotopelabeled retinals. For octopus rhodopsin, the difference spectra between bathorhodopsin and rhodopsin, and between isorhodopsin and rhodopsin have been measured and compared with those of bovine rhodopsin [13]. Recently, we have observed the infrared difference spectrum between octopus acid metarhodopsin and rhodopsin, and in the same study we have found a new precursor of octopus acid metarhodopsin called "transient acid metarhodopsin" at a neutral condition [14]. The visible absorption spectrum of this precursor is similar to that of acid metarhodopsin, but conformational differences seem to exist between their opsin moieties. An interesting feature in the infrared difference spectrum between bovine lumirhodopsin and rhodopsin is a large difference in the shifts of their C=N stretching bands upon exchange of the Schiff-base proton with deuteron (see below). In the vibrational spectra (resonance Raman and infrared difference spectra) of rhodopsin or bacteriorhodopsin, the bands assigned to the C=N stretching usually shift to lower frequencies upon H/D exchange [12,15--191. This H/D shift is regarded as evidence of the protonation of the Schiff-base linkage in retinal proteins. The magnitude of this shift is different for rhodopsin, bacteriorhodopsin, and their intermediates in the transformation series, presumably reflecting differences in environments around the Schiff-base

linkage. For bovine rhodopsin and bathorhodopsin, resonance Raman spectroscopy has shown that the shifts are more than 30 cm-' [15,16]. Similar results have been obtained by Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy [ 121. However, the H/D shift observed for bovine lumirhodopsin is only 4cm-*, and it has been suggested on the basis of these results that the environment around the Schiff-base linkage hardly changes in the transformation from bovine rhodopsin to bathorhodopsin, and major changes occur on going from bathorhodopsin to lumirhodopsin [ 121. As an extension of our infrared studies on structural changes occurring in the phototransformation series of octopus rhodopsin, we report in this paper the infrared difference spectra between octopus lumirhodopsin and rhodopsin, and evaluate the H/D shifts of the C=N stretching frequencies. We discuss the relationship between the H/D shift of the C=N stretching band and the hydrogen bond involving the protonated Schiff base. Materials and methods Octopus (Paroctopus dejleini, Mizudako) microvillar membranes were prepared in the manner described previously [6]. About 300 ~1 of 1OmM Tris/HCl buffer solution (pH x 7) was added to about 1 ml of a suspension (x 90 PM) of the microvillar membranes, and the mixture was centrifuged at 16 000 r-pm. Deuterated sample was obtained in the same way using a DzO buffer solution. The strong amide-II band observed at about 1560 cm-' in the infrared spectrum of the undeuterated sample disappeared in the spectrum of the deuterated sample, indicating that exchangeable protons in the sample were deuterated almost completely. Infrared measurements were performed on a JEOL JIR- 100 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector (JUDSON) at 4cm-' resolution. The sample was placed between two CaFz plates and cooled to 210K with a cryostat (Oxford DN 704), in order

to measure spectral differences between lumirhodopsin and rhodopsin. Octopus rhodopsin has its visible absorption at 476nm, and that for lumirhodopsin is at about 490nm. Blue-violet light (wavelength 400440nm) was used to induce the phototransformation from rhodopsin to lumirhodopsin, and orange-yellow light (wavelength > 540~) was used for the reverse phototransformation. A projector lamp with TOSHIBA glass filters V-44 and O-54 was used to obtain blueviolet and orange-yellow light, respectively. In the remainder of this paper, the colors of the two kinds of light are simply called "blue" and "orange", respectively. To avoid baseline fluctuation, infrared spectra were obtained as described below. First, 250 interferograms were accumulated under irradiation with blue light and Fourier transformed (spectrum A). The same number of interferograms were then accumulated under irradiation with orange light and Fourier transformed (spectrum B). Although both spectra A and B contain contributions from rhodopsin and lumirhodopsin, spectrum A contains a greater contribution from lumirhodopsin, and spectrum B contains that from rhodopsin. Thus, the difference spectrum obtained by subtracting spectrum B from spectrum A corresponds to differences between lumirhodopsin and rhodopsin. Accumulation of spectra A and B was repeated many times, and the results were averaged separately. Bathorhodopsin, the precursor of lumirhodopsin, was thermally stable only at temperatures below lOOK. Thus, the contribution of bathorhodopsin to the difference spectrum was negligible at the temperature of this experiment (210 K).

Schiff-base linkage, and the others primarily from the C=O stretching modes of the carbonyl group in the main and side chains of opsin. Band intensities in this region are weak in comparison with those in the difference spectrum between acid metarhodopsin and rhodopsin [14]. This indicates that the structural changes in the opsin moiety occur in a later step of the transformation series of octopus rhodopsin. Spectral differences between Figs. l(a) and l(b) must be associated with the shift of the C=N stretching mode on going from the protonated Schiff base to the deuterated one, because the other bands in this region would be less sensitive to H/D exchange. A difference spectrum was obtained by subtracting the difference spectrum in Fig. l(a) from that in Fig. l(b) by using the positive band at 1689cm-' as a common intensity reference. The result is shown in Fig. 2.

Infrared difference spectra between octopus lumirhodopsin and rhodopsin in Hz0 and DzO are shown in Fig. 1. In the 1700-1600 cm-' region, several bands overlap with each other. One of them is thought to arise from the C=N stretching mode of the

Two positive and two negative bands are observed in the 1700-1600cm-' region. The positive bands arise from either rhodopsin in Hz0 or lumirhodopsin in D20, whereas the negative bands from either lumirhodopsin in Hz0 or rhodopsin in DzO. From Fig. 2 alone, it is difficult to determine which of the two bands is to be assigned to rhodopsin or lumirhodopsin. According to a resonance Raman study [17], the C=N stretching band of a mixture of octopus rhodopsin and acid metarhodopsin in Hz0 appears at 1657cn-' and is independent of the relative amounts of these two species in the mixture. Hence, the positive band at 1660cm-' in Fig. 2 is assigned to rhodopsin in H20. This band shows a downshift of 25 cm-' upon H/D exchange [18]. This indicates that the negative band at 1635 cm-' arises from rhodopsin in DzO. The two remaining bands must then arise from lumirhodopsin; the negative band at 1643 cm-' may be assigned to lumirhodopsin in Hz0 and the positive band at 162Ocm-' to that in DzO. The rather large H/D shift observed for the C=N stretching band of octopus lumirhodopsin is interesting. As noted in the Introduction, the corresponding band of bovine lumirhodopsin is almost unaffected by H/D exchange [12,19]. The H/D shift has been considered to reflect the strength of the hydrogen bond between the

protonated Schiff base and its counterion [16,20-231; i.e. the larger the C=N stretching band shifts upon H/D exchange, the stronger the hydrogen bond. The hydrogen bond involving the Schiff base in bovine lumirhodopsin must be weak, because its C=N stretching band is rather insensitive to H/D exchange. The H/D shift for octopus lumirhodopsin (23cm-`) is comparable with that for octopus rhodopsin (25cm-`), indicating that the hydrogen bonds in these two species are of about the same strength. A qualitative explanation for the cause of the H/D shift is usually given as follows. In the NH species, the NH in-plane bending is expected to be mixed with the C=N stretching, and it is this mixing that makes the C=N stretching frequency higher than the intrinsic C=N stretching frequency. With increasing strength of the hydrogen bond between the NH group and the counter anion, the NH bending frequency shifts to higher frequencies, making the C=N stretching frequency even higher. In the ND species, little mixing is expected between the ND bending and the C=N stretching, because the ND bending frequency is far lower than the NH bending. Accordingly, the C=N stretching frequency in the ND species is closer to its intrinsic frequency. In an attempt to explain the different H/D shifts of the C=N stretching bands observed for bacteriorhodopsin (14 cm-`) and bovine rhodopsin (3Ocn-`), Kakitani et al. [20] have shown that the coupling force constant between the C=N stretching and the NH in-plane bending must be changed by about two orders of magnitude to make the calculated shifts fit the above two cases; in other words, a much larger (absolute value) coupling force constant is needed for bovine rhodopsin than for bacteriorhodopsin. On the basis of a simple vibrational analysis, Maeda et al. [24] have shown that the H/D shift is hardly affected by introduction of a force constant for the linear N-H. . .X bending coordinate (X being a counter anion).

Alex et al. [22] have observed, using N-isobutylidene isopropylamine as a model compound for the Schiff base, that the H/D shift of the C=N stretching band is smaller when the counterion is a chloride anion than when it is a trichloroacetate anion, whereas the hydrogen bond formed by the former is thought to be stronger than that formed by the latter. Therefore, there is some doubt as to whether the H/D shift of the C=N stretching band can be explained only by the strength of the hydrogen bond between the protonated Schiff base and its counterion. Gilson et al. [21] have evaluated the vibrational frequencies of a model compound of the protonated Schiff base by semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations. They found that the C=N stretching frequency is sensitive to changes in the interaction between the protonated Schiff base and its counterion and that the H/D shift is larger when the counterion is located more closely to the protonated Schiff base. Lussier and co-workers [25-271 and Alex et al. [22] have experimentally shown for model compounds that the C=N stretching frequency of the unprotonated Schiff base is 20-3Ocm-' higher than that of the protonated Schiff base. However, the semi-empirical calculations indicate an opposing tendency [21,28]. The force field obtained from the semiempirical calculations is therefore questionable. Lopez-Garriga et al. [29] have calculated the C=N stretching force constants -of methylimine (CH2=NH) and its protonated species by ab initio molecular orbital methods. According to them, the C=N stretching force constant obtained from Hartree-Fock calculations decreases upon protonation but increases if electron correlation is taken into account. Recently, we have also made ab initio molecular orbital calculations for the force field of iV-ethylidene methylamine (CH&H=NCHs) and its protonated species, and found that the C=N stretching force constants of the unprotonated and protonated species calculated using appropriate basis sets and Msller-Plesset second-order perturbation treatment (and higher approximations as well) are nearly equal [30].

These results indicate that the C=N stretching force constant cannot be evaluated properly without taking into account the effect of electron correlation. According to our Hartree-Fock calculations of the force fields of CHsC!H=N+HCHs and its hydrogen-bonded complex, the coupling constant between the C=N stretching and the N-H in-plane bending becomes only slightly smaller in absolute value for the hydrogen-bonded complex [30]. As pointed out above, however, it might be difficult to calculate the force field of the Schiff base properly without taking the effect of electron correlation into account. Although it is probably correct to consider that the absolute frequency and the H/D shift of the C=N stretching band reflect the environment around the protonated Schiff base, it seems fair to say at present that further studies are needed, both experimentally and theoretically, to elucidate factors determining these quantities. In the 1600-l 500 cm-' region, the negative band at 1564cm-' and the positive band at 1539 cm-' in Fig. l(a) arise from the C=C stretching bands of the retinal moiety. These bands are observed in the difference spectrum owing to the cistrans isomerization of the retinai moiety on going from rhodopsin to lumirhodopsin [13]. In the difference spectrum between octopus bathorhodopsin and rhodopsin, the corresponding bands appear at 1562 and 1532 cm-`, respectively. The positive band at 1544cm-' in Fig. 2 is considered to arise from lumirhodopsin in D20, because the intensity of the positive band at 1539cm-' in Fig. l(b) is higher than that of the positive band at 1539crr-' in Fig. l(a), whereas the intensity of the negative band at 1566 cn-' in Fig. l(b) is about equal to that of the negative band at 1564cm-' in Fig. l(a). It seems, therefore, that the positive band at 1544cm-' in Fig. 2 arises from a vibrational mode of the opsin moiety which shifts in frequency upon H/D exchange. Further studies are needed to identify the origin of this band.
