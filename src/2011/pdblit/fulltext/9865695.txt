The ferrichrome-iron receptor in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli K-12 was isolated by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution of the protein from the gel into solution. This protein, called the /huA ( - t o n A ) gene product, was biologically active in non-ionic detergent solutions because it was able to inactivate T5 phages. Antibodies were raised against/huA protein by injecting rabbits with isolated material in polyacrylamide chips. Titers of specific immunoglobulin were confirmed by microenzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. The gamma globulin fraction of anti-/'huA protein completely blocked the adsorption of T5 phage, and partially inhibited ferrichrome-promoted iron uptake.

The outer membrane of Escherichia coli contains several protein receptors which play a role in the transport of certain nutrients and in the binding of bacteriophages and colicins (for reviews, see Refs. 1-3). It is now recognized that some of these proteins have a function in the uptake of ferric iron which is required for cellular growth. Iron may be taken up in several ways: as enterochelin [4,5], as ferric citrate [6,7], as ferrichrome [8,9] or as aerobactin [10]. These four ligands mediate high affinity transport of ferric iron and are involved in different pathways operating independently of each other. Some features are common to the first three of these systems: the ligand binds to an outer membrane protein which acts as specific receptor; the ferric complex is transported by an energy-dependent mechanism; and iron is released from the ligand, presumably by reduction. Ferrichrome is a cyclic hexapeptide of the sec-

ondary hydroxamic acid type (740 daltons) and is produced by a mould, Ustilago. E. coli may satisfy its iron requirements by using this exogenously supplied compound. Ferrichrome-promoted iron transport is mediated by two gene products [11]: (i) the fhuA(=tonA) gene product is an outer membrane protein of M r 78000 and acts by binding ferrichrome; (ii) the tonB gene product is a 36000-dalton protein [12] to which no activity has yet been ascribed [13]. Following iron uptake, ferrichrome is modified by an acylation reaction of E. coli; the acylated derivative is rendered inactive as a high-affinity ligand [14]. The fhuA gene product was originally identified as the receptor protein for phage T5 and for colicin M in the outer membrane of E. coil [ 15,16]. This protein, one of the first examples of a 'multifunctional' outer membrane protein in E. coli, acts as a receptor for deleterious agents such as viruses (T1, T5, and q~80 and colicin M), and plays a beneficial role in mediating ferrichrome-promoted iron transport. In an attempt to understand the multifunc-

155 tional nature of such a receptor, this paper describes a method for the isolation of the fhuA protein by using a combination of preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution of the protein from a gel into solution. Antibodies raised against SDS-denatured fhuA protein were tested for their ability to block the irreversible adsorption of T5 phage to the bacterial cell surface and to inhibit ferrichrome-promoted iron uptake.
Materials and Methods

Bacterial strains. The strains of Escherichia coli K-12 used in this study were as follows: AB2847, aroB, thi, tsx, malT, wild-type for this study; its fhuA derivative P8; PL-6, ompA, cir, feuB, missing proteins II*, the colicin I receptor, and the enterochelin receptor, and derived from AB2847; PL-6 fhuA, selected by resistance to phage T5. These strains have been characterized in previous studies [17-19]. Bacteriological methods and culture conditions.
The E. coli K-12 strains were grown in a minimal medium of M9 salts [20], 0.4% glucose, and required growth supplements. Citrate was included in the medium at 1.0 mM in order to provide a sufficient source of iron. Bacteria were also grown in medium 1, composed of Difco tryptone (8 g/l), yeast extract (5 g/l), and NaCI (5 g/l). Preparation of outer membranes. 50g of cell paste from strain PL-6 was thawed by stirring in 250 ml cold buffer, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 #M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) Bacteria were washed once with this buffer and broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 15000 lb/in 2. To the cell lysate were added DNAase (final concentration, 10 #g/ml), 20 p g / m l RNAase, 1.0 mM MgSO4, and 25 /~g/ml lysozyme. The suspension was incubated for 60 rain at 37°C. Cell envelopes consisting of inner membranes plus outer membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 40000 × g for 30 rain. Envelopes were repeatedly extracted with 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 2% Triton X-100, 10 #M PMSF by vigorous stirring at room temperature for 30 min intervals. After four such extractions, membranes were precipitated by the addition of 2 vol. cold ( - 2 0 ° C )

absolute ethanol and allowed to stand overnight at - 2 0 ° C . The yield from 50 g of cells was 275 mg membrane protein as determined by the dye binding assay for protein [21] using the reagent from Bio-Rad. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel composition described by Lugtenberg et al. [22] was used with the modification that stock solution 1 contained 0.3% (w/v) N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide. Gels were run at a constant current of 15 mA/gel for 50 min to allow migration of proteins through the stacking gel and into the running gel. The current was then increased to 20 mA/gel. Total running time for a preparative slab gel (3.0 mm thickness) was 8h. Gels were stained for protein with Coomassie brilliant blue or for glycoprotein with the periodate Schiff reagent [23]. All reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, including SDS, were from Bio-Rad. The calibration kit of Pharmacia was used for molecular weight determination; the standards were phosphorylase b (94000 daltons), bovine serum albumin (67000 daltons), ovalbumin (43000 daltons), carbonic anhydrase (30000 daltons), trypsin inhibitor (20000 daltons).

Tube gel apparatus for electrophoretic elution of fhuA protein. The recovery of a single species of
protein from SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels has been described by Hanaoka et al. [24]. The apparatus used was essentially a tube to which a bulbous extension had been fused. This extension was sealed with Parafilm and a reservoir was created by introducing 1.0 ml 50% (w/v) sucrose solution. A gel was cast on top of the sucrose and contained 12% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.16% bisacrylamide, and 6 M urea. After polymerization (3 h), the gel was pre-run with electrophoresis buffer (40 mM glycine/NaOH, pH 10.4/0.10% Triton X-100/1.0 mM dithiothreitol) to remove impurities from the urea. The fhuA protein from a preparative slab gel which had been fixed, stained, destained, and dried was recovered as follows: thin horizontal strips of this protein were excised from the dried gel with a razor blade, chopped into chips of 1 mm2, and transferred to the tube apparatus. After allowing the protein-gel sample to swell in electrophoresis buffer, the run was initiated at 2 mA/tube and continued for 16h at 4°C. The fhuA protein was collected into a small

dialysis chamber formed by covering the bottom of the bulbous extension with a dialysis membrane. The recovered protein was concentrated from 1000 to 100 ~1 in a Minicon-B15 clinical sample concentrator (Amicon). Biological assay of fhuA protein. Aliquots of fhuA protein would be expected to inactivate T5 phages so that they could no longer form plaques when plated on a sensitive indicator strain. T5 phages in phage buffer (0,10M Tris-HC1, pH 8.0/0.5M NaCI/1.0 mM CaCI2/0.01% gelatin) were pre-incubated with a suspension of lipopolysaccharide (2.0 mg/ml; isolated from E. coli K-12 and kindly supplied by Dr. K. HeUer, Lehrstuhl Mikrobiologie, Universit~it Ttibingen) at 32°C for 60 min to dissociate aggregated viruses. Lipopolysaccharide was centrifuged in an Eppendorf model 5412 at 13000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was used as a source of phages. Samples of fhuA protein were mixed with a constant number of plaque-forming units (up to 1450 pfu in 30 #1) and a constant amount of lipopolysaccharide (5 #1 of a 2.0 mg/ml suspension). The volume was made up to a total of 100 t~l with phage buffer. After incubation at 32°C for 2 h, a top agar overlay of 0.6% agar in medium 1 and 0.10 ml of indicator E. coli strain AB2847 were added to the tubes and the mixture plated on tryptone/yeast plates. Plaques were counted after overnight incubation at 37°C. Preparation of antisera against fhuA protein. The antigen used to raise antisera against fhuA protein was prepared from outer membranes of strain PL-6 by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Membranes were solubilized (1:1, v/v) in sample buffer 0.0625 M Tris-H'Cl, pH 6.8/2% SDS/10% glycerol/5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Two antigen preparations of the same protein were made by using different heating conditions to solubilize outer membranes: antigen (i), 70°C for 30 min; and antigen (ii), 100°C for 5 min. The mobility of fhuA protein was the same regardless of the temperature of solubilization. The molecular weight of 78000 was in agreement with the previously determined value [17]. From the fixed, stained, destained and dried slab gels, horizontal strips of fhuA protein were excised, cut into small chips, and swollen in sterile saline. Rabbits were immunized with a primary dose of antigen, followed by two booster doses at 10-day intervals.

Blood was withdrawn from the animals by cardiac puncture, allowed to clot in the cold, and the serum was removed. The gamma globulins were prepared by ammonium sulphate fractionation (033% saturation) for a total of three precipitations and then exhaustively dialyzed against boratebuffered saline (0.10M sodium borate/0.07M NaC1, pH 8.5). In order to ensure the specificity of the gamma globulin preparation and to remove cross-reacting antibodies or antibodies present as a result of prior exposure of the rabbits to cell surface antigens of E. coli, the preparations were absorbed against whole cells of strain PL-6 fhuA. Bacteria were grown in medium 1 at 37°C for 5 h to a titer of 7.5- 10 9 cells/ml, harvested by centrifugation, washed with sterile saline, and suspended in saline. To each pool of gamma globulin was added 1 · 10 ~° bacteria. Absorption was at 37°C for 30 min. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 40000 x g for 20 rain. The absorbed gamma globulins were stored at a protein concentration of 25 mg/ml at - 70 °C. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of the antibody preparation were adapted from the methods of Voller et al. [25]. The disposable microtitration plates were protein-binding polystyrene from Cooke Laboratory Products, Dynatech Labs Inc. Outer membranes from strain PL-6 were solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer at 70°C for 30 min. The membrane residue was pelleted by centrifugation at 40000 × g for 20 min and the solubilized proteins were dialyzed for 24 h at room temperature against two changes of coating buffer (0.10 M carbonate-bicarbonate, pH 9.6/10#M PMSF). This dialysis reduced the SDS level to below that which interfered with binding of proteins to the microtiter wells. Doubling dilutions of antigen were made across a horizontal row of wells, beginning with 79 #g of outer membrane proteins in the first well, 39.5 #g in the second well, etc. Adsorption of antigen was carried out overnight at 4°C. Material which had not adsorbed to the well was discarded and the wells were washed with 3 X 200 pl phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-80 (buffer 2). To minimize nonspecific reactions, a 1% (w/v) solution of bovine serum albumin in buffer 2 was added to all wells and incubated overnight at 4°C.

157
The bovine serum albumin solution was discarded, the wells washed with buffer 2, and dilutions of rabbit gamma globulin against fhuA protein from 1/100 to 1/1000 in buffer 2 were introduced into the wells. The reaction of rabbit gamma globulin was left at room temperature for 3 h. Unreacted protein was washed away. A commercial preparation (Bionetics Laboratory Products, Kensington, MD) of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to all wells and incubated for 2 h at ambient temperature. The extent of binding of this heterologous conjugate to the rabbit gamma globulin was monitored at 493 nm by the appearance of a yellow-coloured product from a colourless substrate: 40 mg o-phenylenediamine, 20 #1 30% (v/v) H202, in 100 ml sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0. The reaction was conducted in the dark and at room temperature, and was terminated by the addition of 2 N HESO4. Adsorption of T5 phage to E. coil Strain AB2847 was grown in medium 1 to mid-logarithmic phase, washed twice in buffered saline (155 mM NaCl/2.0 mM MgSO4/1 mM NaH2PO4) and suspended in M9 salts + 1.0 mM MgSO4 + 1.0 mM CaC12 to a desired cell density. Phages (final concentration, 5-l07 pfu/ml) were adsorbed to bacteria (final concentration, 4. l0 s cells/ml) at 32°C for intervals up to 2 h. The adsorption reaction was stopped by 500-fold dilution with buffered saline (32°C). Bacteria were sedimented by brief centrifugation at 5000 × g, 32°C, and unadsorbed phages in the supernatant were titered on strain AB2847. To test for the inhibitory activity by immunoglobulin directed against fhuA protein, washed bacteria (4. l0 s cells) were incubated with 1300/~g IgG at 32°C, 30 min. Excess protein was removed by centrifuging the cells; they were then suspended to the original density and T5 phages were allowed to adsorb. As a control, the IgG preparation was absorbed with outer membrane vesicles from strain PL-6:1300 #g of IgG were reacted with outer membranes (50 /~g membrane proteins) at 32°C, 60 min. The sample was centrifuged at 40000 × g for 20 min, and the absorbed globulins withdrawn and tested as above. medium (medium 3) (10 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.2, 0.5% glucose, 1.0 mM MgSO4). Cells were resuspended in medium 3 + 100 #M nitrilotriacetate to an absorbance of 0.40 at 578 nm. After equilibrating bacteria at 37°C for 5 min, uptake of 55Fe was started by adding an equimolar solution of radioactive iron and ferrichrome to a final concentration of 1.0 #M. Samples were removed at intervals, rapidly filtered onto cellulose nitrate filters (Schleicher and Schull, 0.45 #m), washed twice with 4ml 0.10M LiC1, dried and counted for radioactivity in a Beckman 8000 liquid scintillation counter. Antibody against fhuA protein was tested for its ability to inhibit ferrichrome-promoted iron uptake. Bacteria were washed with desferriferrichrome in medium 3 and 2000 #g IgG was incubated with bacteria, 32°C, 30 rain. Cells were centrifuged to remove excess protein and suspended for transport as above.
Results

Detergent exchange yielded biologically active fhuA protein
Solubilization of the fhuA protein from the cell envelope of E. coli could be considered effective if (i) optimum amounts of receptor were released into solution, free of membranous residue and (ii) biologically active material were recovered. A preparation of isolated outer membrane vesicles from strain PL-6 was mixed with electrophoresis sample buffer giving final concentrations of 1% SDS, 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture was heated to 70°C for 30 min and centrifuged, and the solubilized proteins examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fhuA protein was released by this procedure, whereas the peptidoglycan-associated proteins (Ia, Ib) were not solubilized. The fhuA protein in SDS solution was then tested for biological activity by determining the T5 phage inactivation capacity. The threshold concentration of SDS alone which inactivated T5 phage was 0.10%. The SDS-solubilized protein sample was diluted to 10-fold lower than this threshold concentration; no inactivation capacity of fhuA protein was detectable. If the same sample were exhaustively dialyzed against 10 mM Hepes pH 7.2 0.10% Triton X-100 in order to exchange SDS for Triton X-100, the preparation was highly

Experiment I is representative of data from three independent preparations and shows a wide range of percent inactivation (19-58%) as a function of volume of sample and volume of lipopolysaccharide which were added to the reaction mixture to inactivate the phages. Experiment 2 represents data from five preparations in which a very high percent inactivation of input phages was observed (greater than 91%).

This meant that because the majority of protein had run into the lower chamber buffer, excellent resolution of fhuA protein from other proteins was obtained (Fig. 1). The citrate-inducible fecA pro-. tein was present in large amounts because of the addition of 1.0 m M citrate to the growth medium; it was used as a marker at 80500 daltons, immediately above the fhuA protein at 78000 daltons. To test for the presence of glycoproteins in this molecular weight range, a slab gel was cut in half vertically. One half of the gel was stained with Coomassie brillant blue, and the other half with periodate Schiff reagent. Neither fhuA protein nor other proteins revealed by Coomassie blue stained positively by this test. Efficient recovery of protein from SDS-containing gels was achieved using a tube apparatus similar to that of H a n a o k a et al. [24]. The recovered material was assayed by the test for inactivation of T5 phage (Table I). With increasing volumes of fhuA protein, a correspondingly greater inactivaTABLE II DETECTION OF ANTI-.fhuA PROTEIN BY MICRO ELISA The values given are readings at 493 nm after 45 rain of reaction of the peroxidase-conjugated antibody with its substrate; the reactions were not linear after 60 rain. Data for the reactions of immune serum against fhuA protein are compared with data (in parentheses) for immune serum which has been adsorbed against outer membrane vesicles. A 1/100 dilution of the gamma globulin fraction corresponds to 37 #g of protein.

This inactivation effect was enhanced by the addition of lipopolysaccharide in the incubation mixture; lipopolysaccharide alone caused no inactivation of T5 phage; neither electrophoresis buffer nor phage buffer caused virus inactivation. Antiserum against fhuA protein was raised as described in Materials and Methods. Assay of the fractionated g a m m a globulins was carried out by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). D a t a from the checkerboard titration are shown in Table II. At low antibody dilutions the readings of the colorimetric test (493 nm = 0.82 to 0.61) indicated strong reactivity of the enzyme-linked immunoconjugate with rabbit g a m m a globulin against fhuA protein. This activity was reduced (493 nm = 0.28 to 0.14) with highly diluted samples of g a m m a globulin. Specificity of the micro ELISA reactions was determined by twice absorbing the g a m m a globulin preparation with outer membrane vesicles from E. coli strain PL-6. If anti-fhuA antibodies were present in the serum, they would be removed by this step. This absorbed antibody was then used instead of the immune serum and was followed by reaction with goat anti-rabbit I g G conjugated to peroxidase. The enzyme reactions gave strongly diminished colorimetric values on both the horizontal and vertical axes as compared to the values for the reaction with immune serum. These results confirm that antibody can be raised against fhuA protein by using the protein in acrylamide as an antigen. It is noteworthy that no antibody could be elicited against fhuA protein which had been solubilized in sample buffer at 100°C for 5 min and then electrophoresed (antigen (ii) in Materials and Methods). W h e n the g a m m a globulin fractions against antigen (ii) were tested for the presence of antibodies, all reactions of the micro ELISA were negative.

Inhibitory activity by antiserum of functions mediated by fhuA protein
Antibody specificity and recognition of the native conformation of fhuA protein on the outer surface of the outer m e m b r a n e of E. coil was tested by its ability to inhibit two functions of the receptor:

(i) Adsorption of T5 phage. Whole cells of E. coli strain AB2847 were reacted with g a m m a globulin to permit binding of antibody to antigen. Excess protein was removed from the reaction mixture and T5 phages were allowed to adsorb to the treated cells. Fig. 2 shows a kinetic determination of the number of free phages relative to the input number of phages as a function of incubation time. In the absence of g a m m a globulin, T5 adsorbed to wild-type K-12 over a 2 h period. G a m m a globulin effectively blocked phage adsorption since the ratio of P/P0 remained constant (approx. 1.0) over 120 min. This specific g a m m a globulin could be removed by absorption two times with outer membrane vesicles from strain PL-6. When this absorbed serum was tested, it was found not to inhibit the irreversible binding of T5 phage to the cell surface. (ii) Ferrichrome-promoted iron transport.

body directed against fhuA protein, the high-affinity transport of SSFe into strain AB2847 was decreased to about 45% of the initial velocity. Higher amounts of g a m m a globulin (up to 4000 #g protein per 10 9 cells) did not reduce further these transport kinetics. When antibody was absorbed with outer membrane vesicles from strain PL-6, the level of ferrichrome-promoted iron uptake was restored to levels displayed by the wild-type. The mutant strain P8 was tested for ferrichrome-promoted transport of 5SFe and no incorporation of iron was observed. Treatment of strain P8 with g a m m a globulin had no effect on its inability to take up iron.

Discussion

It has been recognized for some time [8,9] that one bacterial cell surface protein acts as a phage receptor, as a colicin receptor, and as the ferrichrome-iron receptor. There has been considerable difficulty encountered in obtaining pure preparations of the fhuA ( = tonA) gene product because it is a minor protein in the outer membrane of E. coli and found in less than 1000 copies per cell [29]. The original accounts of the isolation of the tonA protein from E. coil B relied upon gel filtration chromatography and DEAE-ion exchange chromatography in the presence of Triton X-100 [15,16]. The receptor protein did not elute as a single symmetrical peak from either column. When fractions which displayed T5 inactivation capacity were pooled and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS, one band was found in common. It is possible that this material was still a complex of proteins with similar molecular weights. The several improvements made since 1973 in polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis [22] have been exploited in this paper to resolve outer membrane proteins in the molecular weight range of 75000 to 85000. Judicious selection was made of E. coli strain PL-6 which was missing three components: protein II* (33000 daltons), the enterochelin receptor (80000 daltons), and the colicin I receptor (74000 daltons). Upon treatment of isolated outer membranes of this strain at 70°C in 1% SDS and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, the major porin proteins were not solubilized; only minor proteins were released into the 40000 X g supernatant. This meant that a preparative polyacrylamide slab gel could be loaded with approx. 20 minor proteins which were subsequently well resolved. Elution of the fhuA protein from a fixed, stained, destained, and dried gel was effectively achieved by a tube gel device [24]. It is remarkable that the receptor protein was still biologically active after exchange of SDS in the dried gel for Triton X-100 in solution. Legault-Demare et al. [27] reported their unsuccessful attempt to renature the fhuA protein after SDS extraction. The degree of inactivation of T5 phages by the eluted fhuA protein alone was less than the inactivation if lipopolysaccharide were included in the mixture (Table 1). The three dimensional

movement of the phages in solution may be restricted or directed by lipopolysaccharide before making contact with the receptor. Heller and Braun [30] demonstrated that reversible binding of phage T5 is mediated by lipopolysaccharide and is followed by an irreversible binding of phage T5 to the receptor. The fhuA gene product contributes in some measure to the antigenicity of the cell surface of E. coil since one can elicit antibodies against this protein. Immunization of rabbits was carried out using fhuA protein which had been denatured at 70°C in SDS (antigen i) and then electrophoresed. Because no increase in agglutination titer could be detected between pre-immune sera and immune sera (unpublished data), the more sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was adapted to show antibodies specific for fhuA protein. Boiling the outer membranes in SDS (antigen ii) apparently altered the conformation of the fhuA gene product since antibodies could not be raised against boiled protein. The immunoglobulin fraction of anti-fhuA protein antiserum was tested for its ability to inhibit two functions mediated by the receptor. IgG completely blocked the irreversible adsorption of T5 phage to the bacterial cell surface (Fig. 2). This suggests the following: (i) that the antibody combining site on the fhuA protein is exposed at the cell surface and allows recognition by immunoglobulin; (ii) that the phage T5 binding site is masked when immunoglobulin is bound to the receptor; (iii) that the antibody combining site either overlaps or coincides with the phage T5 binding site. It is also possible that binding of an immunoglobulin molecule to the receptor interferes sterically with the adsorption of T5 phage. On the other hand, IgG did not completely inhibit ferrichrome-promoted iron uptake (Fig. 3). The domain of the fhu~l protein which is involved in this function may have been only partially masked by the binding of antibodies. Some region(s) of the receptor which are responsible for ferrjchromepromoted iron uptake may therefore be shared with the phage T5 binding site. A provocative hypothesis for the operation of tonB-dependent systems has been advanced by Konisky [I]. Structurally different sites may mediate two classes of transport: fhuA-dependent

and tonB-dependent, such as ferrichrome-iron uptake; and fhuA-dependent but tonB-independent, such as phage T5 infection. Sites of apposition were suggested to be transient juxtapositions of outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane, and to be involved in tonB-dependent systems. Sites of adhesion, first demonstrated by Bayer [31] as the zones of infection by T5 phage may be a more stable s,tructural arrangement. It is implied that fhuA protein has some mobility within the plane of the outer membrane, sometimes associated with sites of apposition and at other times with sites of adhesion. There is no direct evidence to support the suggestion [27] that two forms of the fhuA protein exist analogous to the free and bound forms of lipoprotein [32]. In attempts to distinguish between sites of apposition and sites of the adhesion in a morphological sense, we have initiated electron microscopic studies of the cell surface using an electron-dense conjugate of antifhuA protein.
