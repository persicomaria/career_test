The X-ray structure of the tetrameric iron-dependent superoxide dismutase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been refined to an R-factor of 0.167 and a correlation coefficient of 0.954 at 2.0 Å resolution. The crystals are monoclinic P21 and have four subunits related by strong non-crystallographic 222 (or D2 ) symmetry in the asymmetric unit. 198 of the 207 amino acids of each subunit are defined by the electron density which shows that they adopt the conserved fold of other iron- or manganese-dependent SODs. The structure can be divided into two domains, the N-terminal domain involving an extended region followed by two projecting antiparallel a-helices, and the C-terminal domain containing four more helical segments with a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet inserted sequentially between the fourth and fifth helices. The catalytic iron is co-ordinated by five ligands: three histidines (residues 28, 76 and 164), one aspartate (160) and a solvent molecule. The inferred positions of protons at the active site are consistent with the solvent ligand being a hydroxide ion. This ligand interacts with His145 in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis SOD. In the highly homologous Mycobacterium leprae Mn-SOD, the histidine is replaced by glutamine, this being the only significant residue difference within 10 Å of the Fe3+. The nature of the amino acid at this position may influence the metal ion specificity of these enzymes. The subunits of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis SOD associate by polar contacts to form dimers, which closely resemble those of other dimeric or tetrameric Fe- or Mn-SODs. However, the dimer­dimer interactions within the tetramer are novel, being dominated by dimerisation of the 144 to 152 loop regions which connect the outer two b-strands of the three-membered b-sheet. This contrasts strongly with the other tetrameric Fe- or Mn-SODs where the dimer­dimer association is dominated by the projecting aa-turn in the N-terminal domain.

host immune system. Generation of reactive oxygen intermediates is an important component of the host antimicrobial response. Superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1, abbreviated SOD) has been shown to make an important contribution to the survival of several intracellular bacterial pathogens (e.g. Beaman & Beaman, 1990). M. tuberculosis mycobacteria secrete an iron-dependent SOD which is a target for host immune responses (Andersen et al., 1992; Kusunose et al., 1976; Pal & Horwitz, 1992; Zhang et al., 1991).

JMB--MS 351 532 Superoxide dismutase catalysis proceeds by a two-step disproportionation of the superoxide radical (Lavelle et al., 1977; McAdam et al., 1977): M3+ + O2- : M2+ + O2 M2+ + O2- + 2H+ : M3+ + H2 O2 . The metal ion is thought to bind the substrate anion directly as has been shown for inhibitors such as azide (Stallings et al., 1991). X-ray structures are available for several members of the iron- or manganese-dependent SOD family including the human mitochondrial Mn-SOD (Borgstahl et al., 1992; Wagner et al., 1993), the Bacillus stearothermophilus Mn-SOD (Parker & Blake, 1988), the Escherichia coli Fe-SOD (Stallings et al., 1983), the Pseudomonas ovalis Fe-SOD (Stoddard et al., 1990) and the Thermus thermophilus Mn-SOD (Ludwig et al., 1991). The monomers are around 200 amino acids in length and associate to form either dimers or tetramers, although the dimer is the smallest oligomer possessing catalytic activity. The monomers are similar in 3D structure and consist of two domains: the N-terminal domain formed by the first 80 or so residues which adopt a predominantly a-helical tertiary structure, and the C-terminal domain, which has an a + b fold. The catalytic site is at the interface of both domains, each of which provide co-ordinating ligands for the essential metal ion. The active site residues of iron and manganese SODs are almost completely conserved, the metal being ligated by three histidine side-chains and one

aspartate carboxyl, which are surrounded by conserved aromatic residues. This paper describes the X-ray structure analysis ° at 2.0 A resolution of the tetrameric superoxide dismutase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis which has been refined to an R-factor of 0.167. We compare the structure of this enzyme with homologues in the Feand Mn-dependent SOD family to identify residues important for their different metal ion specificities and quaternary interactions.

Results and Discussion
Quality of the structure analysis In the final cycle of refinement the structure had an R-factor of 0.167 and a correlation coefficient of 0.954. The RMS deviations from ideal stereochem° istry are acceptable for a structure at 2.0 A resolution (Table 1). The method of Read (1986) gives an ° estimated RMS co-ordinate error of 0.24 A. A Ramachandran plot for the first subunit of the protein (subunit A) is shown in Figure 1. The majority of residues adopt acceptable f- and c-angles with only three non-glycine residues having positive f-angles outside the left-handed a-helix region. These are Asp89, Asp144 and Lys171, which are replaced by glycine in other members of this SOD family. Residues 144 and 171 are involved in type II' reverse turns and are well defined by the electron density, their main-chain atoms taking part in several hydrogen bonds. In contrast, residue 89 has high

533 pression or disorder in the crystals. Residues 2 to 11 form an extended region which interacts with the first a-helix by van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds. Asp10 makes a salt bridge with Lys81 in the protein's second a-helical region. The extended region ends in three reverse turns in the region 12 to 19 which immediately precedes the first helix (22 to 52). This region, which contains an invariant cis-proline residue (Pro18) in a type VIa reverse turn, makes more extensive hydrogen bond interactions with the remaining protein than the preceding extended region. The N-terminal end of helix 1 is capped by a hydrogen bond interaction between the side-chain of Ser21 and the main-chain nitrogen of Ile24. This helix, which is about eight turns long, provides one ligand, His28, for the catalytic iron and two other invariant residues, Tyr36 and His32, which are probably involved in substrate interactions. The helix is notably long and straight despite being exposed to solvent beyond residue 40 where it extends for ° another 20 A away from the main part of the molecule. The exposed part of this helix may be stabilised by two salt bridges involving Lys46 and Glu49, and Lys38 and Asp42, although both lysine side-chains are poorly defined in the electron density. The C terminus of helix 1 is capped by a hydrogen bond involving the side-chain of Glu54 and the carbonyl of Arg51. Helix 1 is followed by a short extended region and a reverse turn, which immediately precedes helix 2. This region of the molecule is involved in dimer­dimer interactions in both the M. tuberculosis and human superoxide dismutases (see later). Residues 41 to 50 at the C terminal end of helix 1 have been shown to form an epitope in the highly homologous M. leprae enzyme, although binding of antibodies to this region does not inhibit SOD activity (Thangaraj et al., 1990). These results are in accordance with the exposed nature of this region and its distance from the active site. The loop region between helices 1 and 2 appears to have slightly higher than average B-values (Figure 2). The second a-helix stretches from Ile59 to Lys81 and has 6.5 turns antiparallel to helix 1. The interactions between these helices are mainly van der Waals contacts between hydrophobic residues, although there is an interesting hydrogen bond network between them involving His73 side-chain H-bonding to the imidazole of His33 which, in turn, is hydrogen bonded to the indole of Trp80. The latter two residues are invariant and His73 is highly conserved. In addition, the C-terminal lysine residue of this helix makes a salt bridge with the carboxyl of Asp10; this interaction is well defined in the electron density. The second helix provides one of the enzyme's catalytic iron binding residues (His76). Residues in this helix have low temperature factors (Figure 2) indicating that it is a well ordered part of the structure. Part of helix 2 packs between helix 1 and the C-terminal domain, the remainder being buried at the dimer­dimer interface of the tetramer. Accordingly, the solvent accessibilities of residues in this helix are low. Helix 2 is followed by a reverse

temperature factors as it resides in the flexible loop linking both domains. Nonetheless, its main-chain conformation is reasonably well defined by the electron density in some of the subunits. Overall, 89% of the residues have f- and c-angles within the ``most favoured regions'' according to the PROCHECK criteria of Morris et al. (1992). By the same criteria, the side-chain torsion angles are acceptable for a structure of this resolution. The isotropic B-values, averaged for the main-chain and side-chain atoms of all residues in the tetramer, are shown in Figure 2 together with a graph showing the solvent-accessible contact areas. As can be seen, the refined B-values are acceptable and consistent for all subunits. There is a clear correlation between the solvent accessibility of the polypeptide and the atomic B-values (see later). An indication of the quality of the electron density is given in Figure 3 where part of the 144­152 loop is shown. This loop, which connects the outer strands of the b-sheet, is important for quaternary interactions in the tetramer and has a very different conformation in the initial search model, human Mn-SOD. Tertiary structure of the subunits The overall fold of the M. tuberculosis SOD subunit is shown in Figure 4. The crystallographically independent subunits making up the tetramer superimpose on each other with RMS deviations of ° their Ca atoms close to 0.2 A, indicating that they adopt highly similar three-dimensional structures. Residue 1 of each subunit is not defined by the electron density indicating cleavage during ex-

This region marks the end of the N-terminal domain, the remainder of the protein forming the C-terminal domain (nomenclature of Ludwig et al., 1991). This domain linker region (84 to 92) appears to be significantly more flexible than the rest of the

protein, as reflected in the temperature factor and solvent accessibility plots (Figure 2). Helix 3 consists of residues 93 to 103, which form 3.5 turns of exposed helix located in between the end of helix 4 and one of the outer strands (136 to 143) of the three-membered b-sheet. Helix 3 is followed by a short loop region leading into another partly

exposed helical segment (helix 4) which extends from 106 to 118. Both of these helices are rich in the helix-forming amino acid, alanine, and make extensive hydrophobic interactions with the remainder of the protein. Helix 4 is 3.5 turns in length and is capped at the N terminus by a serine residue (Ser105 Og-N Lys108) and at the C terminus by two threonine residues (Thr118 Og1-O His114, Thr119 Og1-O Ala115). This helix and other parts of the subunit proximal to it are involved in dimer­dimer interactions with the tip of the extended aa-turn (52 to 59) of the adjacent subunit. These dimer­dimer interactions are predominantly non-polar.

Helix 4 is followed by a long extended region, which crosses the interior of the protein and forms the central strand (124 to 131) of the b-sheet. The majority of side-chains in this strand, and the other two, are hydrophobic, in accordance with the buried nature of the sheet. This strand is followed by an intensively hydrogen bonded b-hairpin turn (132 to 135). The side-chain of Asp131 makes hydrogen bonds to the main-chain nitrogens of residues 133 and 134 in this loop. The mean isotropic temperature factors for this part of the molecule are higher than average (Figure 2) indicating increased flexibility of the polypeptide. This hairpin is a type I 4:4 turn of the Sibanda & Thornton (1989) nomenclature with main-chain angles following the aR aR gR aL consensus for residues 132 to 135, respectively. Asn135 adopts the left-handed a-helical conformation, which is presumably stabilised by a hydrogen bond from its side-chain nitrogen to the main-chain carbonyl of Thr132. The strand following this loop extends from residues 136 to 143 and, together with helix 4, forms one face of the subunit which participates in dimer­dimer interactions. The following stretch of polypeptide which precedes the final strand (153 to 160) of the sheet contains two reverse turns (143 to 146, 150 to 153) and, more Table 2

JMB--MS 351 536 importantly, participates in strong, buried dimer­ dimer contacts with the equivalent region of the neighbouring subunit. The contacts involve hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between residues each side of the intervening non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. In the 144 to 152 loop region, His145 is worthy of note as it interacts with the active site solvent ligand and is replaced by glutamine in the closely homologous M. leprae Mn-superoxide dismutase and the human Mn-SOD. This residue difference may contribute to the different metal ion specificities (see later). This loop is one region where the different iron and manganese-dependent SODs vary greatly in sequence and three dimensional structure. The last b-strand (153 to 160) is predominantly hydrophobic (e.g. four consecutive leucines) with the exception of Asp160, which is one of the catalytic iron-binding residues. Ile153, the first residue in this strand adopts an unusual side-chain conformation (x2 = -62°), which is, nonetheless, very well defined in the electron density. This b-strand is followed by a region (162 to 165) that can be considered as a single turn of 310-helix followed immediately by one turn of a-helix (166 to 170). The 310-helix contributes one residue (His164) to the iron-binding site. Both the above short helices are very important for the geometry of the active site as they are involved in 2-fold symmetrical monomer­monomer contacts within the dimer. They are followed by a reverse turn (170 to 173) leading into a more regular helical region (helix 5) extending from residues 174 to 183. This helix and the one following it (187 to 198) are exposed except at the joining region where the chain is crossed by residues 83 to 87 in the loop connecting helices 1 and 3. The final helix is stabilised by a partly buried salt bridge between residues Asp189 and Arg 193. Residues 200 to 207 are not visible in the electron density map, indicating that they may be disordered in solvent or may have been cleaved by the expression host. In terms of the linear sequence, the b-sheet region of the polypeptide is bracketed by helices 4 and 5 which interact in an antiparallel manner in threedimensional space. These two helices, together with helices 3 and 6, form a cradle into which one face of the highly twisted b-sheet packs. This sheet has the ``N-centred overhand topology'' that is the most common arrangement for isolated three-membered sheets (Richardson & Richardson, 1989). The loop (144 to 152) that connects the two outer b-strands, crosses the sheet diagonally on the opposite side to the helices. This loop is involved in strong dimer­dimer contacts within the tetramer. The sheet is therefore largely buried by the helical elements on one side and by a neighbouring subunit on the other. Accordingly, the temperature factors for residues in the b-sheet and the 144 to 152 loop are generally lower than for the helical segments. The highest temperature factors occur at the termini of the subunits, in the domain linker (83 to 92) and in the vicinity of helices 1, 3, 4 and the loop connecting the first and second b-strands (132 to 135) (see Figure 2).

The topology is indicated in the nomenclature of Richardson & Richardson (1989). Strand 3 contains a classical b-bulge at position 156.

The elements of right-handed a-helix are detailed in Table 2 and Table 3 describes the strands making up the three-membered sheet of this enzyme. Turn regions are listed in Table 4 together with their classifications. Active site structure The SOD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was originally characterised as an iron-dependent ° enzyme by Kusunose et al. (1976). The 2.0 A resolution X-ray structure confirms that the iron is held by three histidines and one aspartate, as observed in structures of other Fe- and Mn-SODs (Borgstahl et al., 1992; Ludwig et al., 1991; Parker & Blake, 1988; Stallings et al., 1983; Stoddard et al., 1990; Wagner et al., 1993). As has been found for other highly refined SOD structures, the metal ion has an extra ligand, which was suggested by Ludwig et al. (1991) to be a hydroxide ion. Although the exact nature of this ligand has not been established, it has been treated as a water molecule for refinement of the M. tuberculosis SOD and, as such, it refines with a reasonable thermal coefficient. The refined electron density for the extra iron ligand is shown in Figure 5. The inferred positions of the hydrogens at the active site suggest that this ligand is indeed an OH- group (see later). As shown in Figure 6, the negative charges of Asp160 and the putative OH- ion will help to offset the triple positive charge of the iron. In the M. tuberculosis SOD the distances between the metal ion and its ligating groups (His28, His76, Asp160, His164 and the solvent ligand) are strongly conserved in the four independently refined subunits, as are most of the hydrogen bond distances in the vicinity of the active site (Figure 6).

The inter-subunit hydrogen bonds occur at the monomer­monomer interface, i.e. between subunits A and B and between subunits C and D. The interactions occur four times in the tetramer due to its strong non-crystallographic 222 (or D2 ) symmetry. The distance shown for each hydrogen bond is the average of the ° donor-acceptor atom separations in Angstrom units. Numerous water-mediated hydrogen bonds also occur.

and M. leprae SOD sequences. These enzymes are 82% identical in terms of amino acid sequence and yet differ in their metal ion specificities, the M. leprae enzyme being Mn-dependent. Residue 145 in this enzyme is glutamine, as it is in the human mitochondrial and T. thermophilus Mn-SODs. In the X-ray structures of the latter two enzymes, the glutamine side-chain makes an H-bond to the solvent molecule co-ordinating the metal ion. Whether residue 145 is His or Gln may therefore play a role in the metal ion specificity of the enzyme. However, there may not be a direct correlation between the nature of this residue and the apparent metal ion dependence since in the more distantly related Fe-SOD from P. ovalis (Stoddard et al., 1990) His145 is replaced with alanine and the side-chain of glutamine 70 (P. ovalis numbering) occupies the same position in 3D as that of His145 in the M. tuberculosis SOD. There is another compensating difference between the M. tuberculosis and P. ovalis SODs in this region: glutamine 70 in the P. ovalis enzyme is replaced by glycine 72 in the M. tuberculosis SOD sequence, thereby allowing sufficient space for the His145 side-chain to come close to the active site.

residues including tryptophans 79, 80, 125 and 162, tyrosine 36 and phenylalanine 68. In the Mn-dependent SODs from Thermus thermophilus and human mitochondria, the putative OH- ion is hydrogen-bonded to a glutamine side-chain which is structurally equivalent to histidine 145 in the M. tuberculosis SOD structure. In our initial interpretation of the electron density for the M. tuberculosis SOD we aligned the His145 imidazole such that it could hydrogen-bond with the putative OH - ion. However, this resulted in ° unfavourably close van der Waals contacts (<3.0 A) being formed between the imidazole CH groups and the polar side-chain atoms of Trp125 and Tyr36. A more feasible interpretation was obtained by rotating the His145 imidazole through 180° about the Cb­Cg bond. This yielded excellent hydrogen bonds between the imidazole nitrogens and the side-chains of Trp125 and Tyr36 (see Figure 6) but resulted in a ° fairly close contact of around 3.2 A between the putative OH- ion and Ce1 of His145. However, this should be an acceptable van der Waals interaction if, as shown in Figure 6, the putative hydroxide's hydrogen atom is oriented towards the carboxyl of Asp160, thereby making a hydrogen bond with it. Were the iron's solvent ligand to be a water molecule instead of OH-, the likely position of the extra proton in the water would be too close to the Ce1 of His145 for a favourable van der Waals contact. Were the extra ligand to be another anionic species such as Cl-, then there could be no stabilising hydrogen bond with the adjacent negatively charged carboxyl of Asp160. Therefore, the environment of this ligand is consistent with it being a hydroxide ion as originally proposed by Ludwig et al. (1991). Residue 145 is the only position within at least ° 10 A of the active site metal ion where there is a significant difference between the M. tuberculosis

Monomer­monomer interactions The subunits of Mn- or Fe-dependent SODs associate to form dimers, which may further oligomerise to form tetramers in many species such as M. tuberculosis. The two subunits within the dimer associate by interactions involving the 163 to 170 region of the M. tuberculosis enzyme. This contains the two single-turn helical segments, 163 to 165 and 167 to 170, which are close to the active site, contain many highly conserved or invariant residues and provide one of the iron ligands (His164). The subunits associate about one of the non-crystallographic 2-fold axes by polar interactions involving the side-chains of a number of invariant residues. The inter-subunit hydrogen bonds formed within the A/B and C/D dimers of the M. tuberculosis SOD are shown in Table 5. The principal interactions involving these short helical segments are between residues 163 (Glu) and 164 (His), the latter being an iron ligand. One side-chain carboxyl oxygen of the glutamate forms a short hydrogen bond with the imidazole Nd1 of residue 164 (see Figure 6) and the other carboxyl oxygen makes a hydrogen bond with the main-chain nitrogen of the same histidine. The imidazole of His32, which is involved in inhibitor and, presumably, substrate binding, makes ° a very short hydrogen bond (2.67 A) with the side-chain -OH group of Tyr167. Both these residues are invariant. Ser123, another highly conserved residue, forms a side-chain hydrogen bond with the same residue of the adjacent subunit. In addition to the hydrogen bonds involving protein groups, there are many more involving well defined water molecules which provide intricate bridging interactions between the subunits.

539 into superposition with those of the M. tuberculosis enzyme. The different quaternary structures of the enzymes in this family are shown in Figure 7. In T. thermophilus the dimers associate quite loosely by interactions involving residues of the aa-unit in the N-terminal domain and residues in the loop linking the two outer strands of one b-sheet in the adjacent dimer (Ludwig et al., 1991). There is a large solvent-filled cavity between the subunits of this enzyme. In contrast, the dimers of the human mitochondrial SOD associate more tightly by virtue of extensive interactions between the aa-turns (in the N-domains) of adjacent subunits (Borgstahl et al., 1992; Wagner et al., 1993) which give rise to four-helix bundle structures. In both the dimeric and tetrameric SODs, the quaternary structures of the functional dimers are strongly conserved. In the M. tuberculosis SOD, the tetramer has a very compact structure. The dimer­dimer interactions are dominated by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic

Dimer­dimer interactions The quaternary interactions in this family of superoxide dismutases are highly variable. Some enzymes, such as the P. ovalis and B. stearothermophilus SODs, are dimeric. The other SODs, which have been solved by X-ray analysis to date, are tetramers. A comparison of the quaternary structures of the human mitochondrial and T. thermophilus SODs revealed that the two dimers in each are oriented very differently with respect to each other (Wagner et al., 1993). Our analysis shows that the C and D subunits of the T. thermophilus enzyme are related to those of the M. tuberculosis SOD by a screw rotation of 14.7° around the intervening 2-fold axis ° and a translation towards the A/B dimer of 11.8 A. In contrast, in the more tightly packed tetramer of the human enzyme, the C/D dimer has to be rotated by ° 98.3° in the same sense and translated by 6.6 A along the dimer 2-fold axis to bring the C and D subunits

interactions involving residues 144 to 152. These residues are in the loop that connects the two outer strands of the b- sheet. The dimers associate such that the 144­152 loops of adjacent subunits are buried at the dimer­dimer interface and are disposed around one of the non-crystallographic 2-fold axes (Figure 8). This mode of dimer-dimer interaction is fundamentally different from that observed in both the human mitochondrial and T. thermophilus SODs. Other interactions at the dimer­dimer interface involve the aa-turn of the first domain, which associates with residues in helix 4 and the 144­152 loop of the neighbouring dimer by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. These interactions, which are summarised in Table 6, also display pseudo 2-fold symmetry due to the non-crystallographic dyad passing between the dimers at the interface. The dimer­dimer interface buries a large amount of surface-accessible area in certain regions of the protein. As can be seen in Figure 9, these regions are helix 4, the tip of the first aa-turn and the 144­152 loop, the latter dominating the interactions in terms of loss of surface-accessible area. In contrast, for the human mitochondrial SOD, the dimer­dimer interactions are dominated by the aa-turns forming four-helix bundles (see above) and the majority of buried solvent-accessible area is in this region of the molecule (Figure 9). In the dimer­dimer interactions of the tetrameric SODs, it is clear that the aa-turn and the 144­152 loop dominate the interactions even though the resulting quaternary structures can be very different. It may therefore be significant that these two regions are where the primary sequences differ most. Accordingly, a least-squares superposition of the M. tuberculosis, T. thermophilus, P. ovalis and human mitochondrial SOD subunits (Figure 10) shows that these two regions are also where the tertiary structures differ significantly. In the human and M. tuberculosis SODs, the aa-unit in the N-terminal domain forms a pronounced, undistorted element of

tertiary structure. In contrast, in the P. ovalis SOD, this region is far less regular, being interrupted by several turns. It also contains an additional helical element which associates with the 144­152 loop (M. tuberculosis numbering) of the same subunit. Hence, it appears that in the P. ovalis SOD, the two regions, which are important for tetramer formation in other SODs, appear to interact with each other, perhaps preventing potential interactions with a neighbouring dimer. This may explain why the P. ovalis enzyme is dimeric. The T. thermophilus SOD monomer also has a distorted aa-unit interacting with the same subunit's 144­152 loop which might, by similar arguments, help to explain why this enzyme forms such a loose tetramer with a large solvent-filled cavity between the subunits. The undistorted, projecting nature of the aa-units in the human and M. tuberculosis SODs may allow strong non-covalent interactions between the dimers. Residue substitutions in the aa-unit and the 144 to 152 region may have a large effect on the nature of the quaternary interactions within this SOD family. The different structures adopted by the 144­152 loops in the M. tuberculosis and human enzymes are shown in Figure 11. The structures diverge significantly at residue 146 (M. tuberculosis numbering), which is Gln in the mycobacterial enzyme and Asp in the human SOD. This aspartate side-chain is involved in a salt bridge with Lys65 in the human SOD whereas in the M. tuberculosis enzyme the glutamine at 146 adopts a very different conformation and forms a hydrogen bond between its side-chain oxygen and the main-chain nitrogen of His145. In this loop, the mycobacterial SOD has a kink at Asn148, which adopts the left-handed helical conformation and a reverse turn involving residues 150 to 153. The majority of residues in this loop are in extended conformations. This contrasts with the human SOD where the loop contains a turn of a-helix including residues 146 to 150 (human numbering). The same region in the mycobacterial enzyme

contains a proline (150) and therefore could not adopt the helical conformation. This loop is where there is a single amino acid insertion in the human enzyme relative to the mycobacterial SOD.

Conclusions
Kusunose et al. (1976) showed that the M. tuberculosis SOD is a tetrameric enzyme with one Fe3+ bound per subunit and is quite stable to heat and SDS treatment. Antibodies to this enzyme cross-reacted with other Fe- and Mn-dependent SODs, which together with the similarity of their amino acid compositions, suggested a common evolutionary origin. Sequences are now available for around 45 Table 6

The inter-subunit hydrogen bonds occur at the dimer­dimer interface, i.e. between subunits A and C and between subunits B and D.

enzymes in this SOD family, including the M. tuberculosis enzyme which was determined by Zhang et al. (1991). Despite having conserved tertiary structures and invariant metal binding residues (three histidines and one aspartate), the metal ion dependence of these enzymes varies from species to species. The X-ray structures show that the only significant sequence difference at the active site between enzymes in this family is the nature of the side-chain, either His or Gln, which interacts with the metal's solvent ligand. Since both residue types occur in Mn- and Fe-dependent SODs, the basis for the different metal ion specificities of these enzymes is still unclear. The X-ray structure of the M. tuberculosis SOD confirms that the enzyme is a compact tetramer with buried hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the functional dimers. Indeed, the dimer­dimer interactions appear to be more extensive than the polar contacts between the monomers within each dimer. Surprisingly, only the latter interactions appear to be evolutionarily conserved, which may be due to the proximity of the catalytic sites to the monomer­monomer interface. Within the dimer, residues in one subunit interact with active site residues in the other. Therefore, the structural integrity of the active sites within the dimer must depend on the monomer­monomer

interactions. In contrast, the dimers of tetrameric SODs associate in different relative orientations in different species. The dimer­dimer interactions vary from being very extensive, as in the case of the M. tuberculosis enzyme, to being comparatively tenuous, such as with the T. thermophilus enzyme which has a large central solvent-filled cavity. Indeed, some Fe- or Mn-SODs, such as P. ovalis, do not form tetramers at all but function as dimeric enzymes. It appears that the major dimer­dimer contacts involve the aa-unit in the N-terminal domain and/or the loop connecting the two outer b-strands in the C-terminal domain. In the M. tuberculosis enzyme, the latter region dominates these quaternary interactions. Both the interacting segments are highly variable in terms of sequence and conformation within this enzyme family and amino acid differences in these regions appear to allow a range quaternary structures to be adopted.

° collection to 2.5 A resolution have been described previously (Zhang et al., 1991; Garbe et al., 1994; Cooper et al., 1994). The crystals are monoclinic P21 and have four subunits per asymmetric unit related by 222 symmetry. The X-ray dataset used in the final refinement was collected at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, U.K.) using a MARresearch image plate ° with a wavelength of 0.92 A. The data were processed using the MOSFLM suite (Leslie, 1992), then scaled and averaged by the Fox & Holmes (1966) algorithm yielding a unique dataset with an R-merge of 9.4%. Overall, 69.7% of the reflections have I > 3s (I ) in this dataset which is ° 80.4% complete to 2.0 A resolution and 86.8% complete to ° 2.3 A. Rotation function ° The initial 2.5 A resolution dataset was used for calculation of the cross-rotation function using the program ALMN (CCP4 suite, EPSRC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, U.K.) with a dimer of the human mitochondrial Mn-SOD (Borgstahl et al., 1992) as the search model. This latter enzyme, like the M. tuberculosis SOD, is a tetramer, but as the relative orientation of the dimers in the tetrameric SODs is known to vary greatly (Wagner et al., 1993) it was decided to use only a dimeric model of human SOD subunits for molecular replacement

 program XS6 (Sali et al., 1992) and then refined to convergence using RESTRAIN. The tetramer was then subjected to restrained atomic positional refinement by essentially averaging the shifts calculated for all subunits and applying them to the first subunit only. This resulted in an improvement in the data:parameter ratio by a factor of 4. Isotropic temperature factor refinement was commenced as the resolution was increased in stages to ° 2.5 A. The resulting model had an R-factor of 33.0% and a correlation coefficient (F0 versus Fc ) of 77.5%. The 2F0 - Fc and F0 - Fc electron density maps (displayed using FRODO (Jones, 1978) on an Evans and Sutherland PS390 graphics terminal) were of excellent quality; almost all of the residue substitutions and loop differences were clearly visible. All the residue changes were made throughout the protein at this stage except at the N and C termini, where the electron density was sparse. The model was then refined by ``averaging'' the four subunits, as before, for three more rounds of refinement and ° manual rebuilding using the 2.5 A resolution dataset. For ° the final six rounds, the 2.0 A resolution synchrotron dataset was used. The four subunits were refined independently and water molecules were added during the rebuilding stages. Full refinement details of the structure are given in Table 1. Comparison of structures Tertiary structural comparisons with other Fe- or Mn-SODs were made by least-squares Ca-superposition of subunits using the program MNYFIT (Sutcliffe et al., 1987). To study differences in quaternary structure, the human and T. thermophilus SODs were fitted to the M. tuberculosis enzyme using their A and B subunits with MNYFIT. The screw rotations and translations, which relate the C and D subunits of the human and T. thermophilus SODs to those of the M. tuberculosis SOD, were calculated with the  program XS6 (Sali et al., 1992). Solvent-accessible areas were calculated using the method of Lee & Richards (1971) and secondary structure assignments were made using the Kabsch & Sander (1983) algorithm.

searches. The human mitochondrial and M. tuberculosis SODs have a sequence identity of 53%. In order to simplify interpretation of the rotation functions the 2-fold axis in the search dimer was aligned parallel to the z-axis. Peaks in the rotation function arising from the non-crystallographic symmetry axis parallel to z in the search model will then occur in the same b-section. The search model was effectively placed in an orthogonal P1 cell with dimensions chosen to ensure that there were ° no intermolecular vectors shorter than 20 A. Normalised structure factors were calculated for this model and native data were also converted to E-values in readiness for the ° rotation searches, which were calculated at 3.0 A resolution with various radii of integration. In the best ° rotation function, which was obtained with a 25 A radius of integration, the two strongest peaks, both with signal-to-noise ratios of 9.2 RMS, were located in the same b-section. These peaks were taken as defining the orientation of one dimer in the target structure, denoted dimer A. The other dimer, denoted dimer B, was discernable as two large peaks of 8.7 RMS and 8.1 RMS in another b-section. The highest noise peak in this rotation function was 4.3 RMS. Similar calculations using the P. ovalis SOD co-ordinates (Stoddard et al., 1990), initially fitted to the dimeric human search model, yielded essentially the same peaks but with reduced height, presumably due to poorer sequence homology with the M. tuberculosis SOD. The orientations of dimers A and B were refined by re-calculating the rotation functions with a finer angular grid. The solutions were then verified by repeating the rotation searches with both re-oriented search models. A strong peak appeared at the origin of Eulerian space in each case. Translation function ° Structure factors to 3.0 A for dimers A and B were calculated separately in a P1 unit cell with dimensions equal to those of the target crystal. These Fc values were then combined with the M. tuberculosis SOD Fobs data by the program CAD (CCP4 suite) which collates the P1 Fc values that are related by the point group symmetry of the target crystal and adjoins them with the corresponding Fobs measurements in readiness for the translation searches. These were calculated using the TFFC program (CCP4 suite). The initial crystallographic translation search, to define the position of dimer A relative to the 21 axis, resulted in an unambiguous peak of 13.9 RMS (highest noise peak = 3.1 RMS). The position of dimer B relative to dimer A was determined using the non-crystallographic translation function incorporated in the TFFC program (Driessen et al., 1991). This yielded another strong peak of height 22.2 RMS, the highest noise peak being 4.6 RMS. This preliminary model of the M. tuberculosis SOD tetramer had no severe steric clashes between the dimers or between symmetry related molecules. The strong non-crystallographic 222 (or D2 ) symmetry apparent in the resulting model is consistent with the self-rotation function reported previously (Cooper et al., 1994). Refinement The two dimers were initially treated as separate rigid bodies for refinement using the program RESTRAIN (Haneef et al., 1985). Following this, the transformation matrices relating the first subunit of dimer A to the other subunits in the tetramer were determined using the
