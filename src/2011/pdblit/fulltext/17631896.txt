All eukaryotic cellular mRNAs contain a 5 m7GpppN cap. In addition to conferring stability to the mRNA, the cap is required for pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear export and translation by providing an anchor point for protein binding. In translation, the interaction between the cap and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is important in the recruitment of the mRNAs to the ribosome. Human 4EHP (h4EHP) is a homologue of eIF4E. Like eIF4E it is able to bind the cap but it appears to play a different cellular role, possibly being involved in the fine-tuning of protein expression levels. Here we use X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate further the binding of cap analogues and peptides to h4EHP. m7GTP binds to 4EHP 200-fold more weakly than it does to eIF4E with the guanine base sandwiched by a tyrosine and a tryptophan instead of two tryptophan residues as seen in eIF4E. The tyrosine resides on a loop that is longer in h4EHP than in eIF4E. The consequent conformational difference between the proteins allows the tyrosine to mimic the sixmembered ring of the tryptophan in eIF4E and adopt an orientation that is similar to that seen for equivalent residues in other non-homologous capbinding proteins. In the absence of ligand the binding site is incompletely formed with one of the aromatic residues being disordered and the sidechain of the other adopting a novel conformation. A peptide derived from the eIF4E inhibitory protein, 4E-BP1 binds h4EHP 100-fold less strongly than eIF4E but in a similar manner. Overall the data, combined with sequence analyses of 4EHP from evolutionary diverse species, strongly support the hypothesis that 4EHP plays a physiological role utilizing both cap-binding and protein-binding functions but which is distinct from eIF4E.

family, interacts strongly2 with the m7GpppN cap found at the 5 end of mRNAs.3 eIF4E is found in all eukaryotes and plays an important role in capdependent translation initiation as part of the heterotrimeric eIF4F complex, responsible for recruiting the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the 5 end of the mRNA.4 The other two proteins of this complex are eIF4A, an RNA helicase, and eIF4G, a scaffolding protein. eIF4E anchors the 5 end of the mRNA by binding to the cap, eIF4G mediates interactions with the 40 S ribosomal subunit and eIF4A unwinds the 5 structured RNA. A number of proteins, known as eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs) can compete with eIF4G in binding eIF4E. The responsivity of this reaction to phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs provides a means of regulating translation initiation.5 Under normal cellular conditions

692 eIF4E is bound to the binding proteins. Upon stimulation the proteins become hyperphosphorylated by the mTOR pathway and are no longer able to bind eIF4E allowing the eIF4F complex to form. eIF4E has also been reported to act independently of eIF4G as a nuclear transporter.6 The structures of eIF4E from human, mouse and yeast7­9 have been solved. The structure, which has been described as resembling a cupped hand, consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel -sheet backed by -helices.7 The cap resides in a crevice on the concave surface of the -sheet with the nucleotide sandwiched between two tryptophan residues. The structure has also been solved in complex with peptides or fragments from eIF4GI, eIF4GII (the two isoforms of eIF4G in mammals) and 4E-BP1. These peptides all bind to the convex portion of eIF4E in a similar manner.10­12 In contrast to eIF4E, there is much less known about 4EHP. It was first discovered in human13 and Aarabidopsis thaliana14 and more recently similar proteins have been characterised from Caenorhabditis elegans 15 and Drosophila melanogaster. 16 The sequence identity between human 4EHP (h4EHP) and eIF4E is 30%, with most of the residues important for the structure or cap binding conserved between the two proteins.13 Like eIF4E, 4EHP can bind the cap.13,14 In 4EHP, however, one of the tryptophan residues sandwiching the m7G is replaced by a tyrosine. Joshi et al. have carried out a sequence analysis of the eIF4E related proteins deposited in the Genbank databases.17 They report that sequences equivalent to h4EHP, which they have named as the eIF4E-2 class, are seen in a wide variety of metazoans, plants and fungi. The tyrosine is conserved in all eIF4E-2 class members. Human h4EHP is reported to be ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in the testis1 although the levels are lower than those of eIF4E.13 The physiological role of 4EHP, however, is unclear. It has been reported that it does not bind to eIF4G1 and consequently cannot carry out the same function as eIF4E. It is also not observed in the nucleus so cannot act as a nuclear transporter.13 It does, however, appear to bind to 4E-BP1 and Tee et al. have reported that over-expression results in a negative feedback loop that inhibits upstream signalling to 4E-BP1 and S6 kinase 1.18 A function for 4EHP has recently been described for the Drosophila homologue d4EHP.19 Here the correct development of the embryo requires an asymmetric distribution of the protein Caudal. This is achieved at the level of translational regulation and involves d4EHP in a complex with another protein, Bicoid. While d4EHP binds to the 5 cap structure of the Caudal mRNA, the d4EHP bound Bicoid interacts with its 3' end, with the result that eIF4F is prevented from binding and translation cannot take place. The expression of Caudal therefore is dependent on the local concentrations of the d4EHP­Bicoid complex, which in turn relates to the asymmetric distribution of Bicoid. Although Bicoid has only been found in higher dipterans it is possible that 4EHP performs a

similar role in the development of other organisms by fine-tuning the expression levels of certain proteins. Here, we investigate how h4EHP differs from eIF4E in both its structure and in its ability to bind cap-analogues and peptides. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data we show that both cap analogues and a peptide derived from 4E-BP1 bind to h4EHP approximately 100-fold more weakly than to eIF4E, but with physiologically relevant affinities. In addition to solving the structure in the presence of m7GTP we also report the structure of the protein determined without a ligand present in the binding site. This is the first crystal structure of a member of the eIF4E family to be reported without a capanalogue bound and shows that the cap-binding site is completely formed only when ligand is present.

Results and Discussion
Full length and truncated forms of h4EHP were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The truncated constructs were designed based on sequence comparisons with eIF4E and on results from limited proteolysis of the full-length protein, which showed that between residues 46 and 226 the protein was relatively resistant to proteolysis. One of these constructs, consisting of residues Lys45 to Phe234 (h4EHP(K45-F234)) expressed well and crystallized easily. The N-terminal truncation is analogous to that used by Marcotrigiano et al. in solving the structure of mouse eIF4E.7 The C-terminal residue corresponds to the final residue of eIF4E, which is slightly shorter than h4EHP (see Figure 1(a)). Neither the N nor the C termini are conserved amongst the eIF4E family and are not important for the binding of m 7 GTP.10 Indeed the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking a functional eIF4E can be rescued by eIF4E mutants lacking the N and C termini.20 Characterisation of protein by isothermal titration calorimetry Using ITC the affinity of m7GTP for h4EHP(K45-F234) was measured to be 2.4(± 0.1) M (see Figure 2(a)). No significant difference was observed when the full-length (protein purified from inclusion bodies, see Materials and Methods), rather than the truncated protein was used suggesting that the C-terminal residues do not influence the binding of m7GTP. The determined affinity is about 200-fold less than the value of 9 nM reported for the binding of m7GTP to eIF4E.2 A reduced affinity for 4EHP with respect to eIF4E is consistent with results reported from experiments on the protein from Drosophila, where it was observed that d4EHP interacts with m7GTP-bound Sepharose less strongly than eIF4E,16 but differs from preliminary experiments on the A. thaliana proteins that indicate that m7GTP binds more strongly to 4EHP than to eIF4E. 14 The discrepancy may be because the binding constant was not measured accurately in

either of the latter cases. In addition to m7GTP the binding affinities of m7GDP (3.2(±0.2) M), m7GMP (30(±2) M) m7GpppA (12(±1) M) and m7GpppG (4(±1) M) for h4EHP were also measured. The trend in the binding affinities is the same as seen for eIF4E,2 although the absolute affinities are on the order of 20­200-fold higher. The binding of GTP was seen to be much lower (60 M) than for m7GTP, only being detectable using very high concentrations of ligand in the experiment. As for eIF4E,2 it appears that the positive charge conferred by the methyl group is critical for binding and each phosphate contributes to the affinity.

The affinities of peptides derived from 4E-BPI and eIF4GII were also measured by ITC. The dissociation constant for the 4E-BP1 peptide was 0.81(±0.03) M (see Figure 2(b)) and for the eIF4GII peptide 25(±2) M (not shown). In the literature the equivalent peptides, which were designed as the minimal recognition unit of eIF4E, were reported to bind eIF4E with affinities of 0.05 M and 0.15 M, respectively.10 Both peptides, therefore, bind to h4EHP with approximately 100-fold less affinity than to eIF4E. With the caveat that the binding of the peptide may not be the same as the full-length protein, the low affinity of the eIF4GII

peptide for h4EHP provides further evidence that 4EHP does not compete with eIF4E in binding to the translation machinery. On the other hand, the affinity of h4EHP for the 4E-BP1 peptide may be physiologically relevant. In this case the presence of 4EHP could modulate translation by sequestering the eIF4E inhibitory protein. Structure of h4EHP with m GTP and peptide The structure of h4EHP(K45-F234) in complex with m7GTP and a peptide of 4E-BP1 was determined by molecular replacement using eIF4E as the search model. It was refined at a resolution of 1.7 Å to an R-factor of 20.1% and an R-free of 24.2% (details can be seen in Table 1). The model contains m7GTP, 16 of the 17 residues of the peptide and all protein residues from Lys45 to Phe234 apart from residues 225 to 227, which were not seen in the electron density. The overall structure of h4EHP is very similar to that of eIF4E. A central curved -sheet consisting of seven antiparallel -strands is flanked on its convex surface by three -helices that run almost parallel to the -strands (Figure 1(b)). The m7GTP binding site is situated on the concave surface of the -sheet, with the loop and helix between strands 1 and 2 (hereinafter referred to as loop-12), the loop between strands 3 and 4 and the C-terminal -helix, 4, contributing to form a cleft in which the ligand is situated.

The peptide is bound as an -helix almost perpendicular to the -helices on the convex side of the -sheet.

695 contains an additional short -helix (helix 0 (residues 75 to 82) in Figure 1(b)) and encloses more of the m7GTP binding site. Although the average temperature factor for the loop is higher than the average for the structure, its conformation is well defined in the electron density. At the N terminus the structural similarity starts at Ala53 (Ile35 in eIF4E). In the structure of h4EHP the first seven residues fold back onto the rest of the structure in a right-handed type I -turn, whereas

The root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the structure of h4EHP(K45-F234) and that of human eIF4E complexed with m7GTP and peptide (PDB accession code 1IPC9) is 1 Å for 154 out of a possible 173 C pairs (see Materials and Methods). The main variations occur at the N and C termini and in loop-12 (Figure 1(b) and (c)). The change in loop-12, which forms one wall of the ligandbinding site, seems to be the most significant. In h4EHP it is four residues longer than in eIF4E,

696 in eIF4E the N terminus is more extended. It is possible, however, that this is an artifact of crystallization since in eIF4E the conformation of the N-terminal residues depends on the construct and the crystal form. Moreover, in yeast eIF4E the conformation of the N terminus is modified considerably when an eIF4G fragment binds.11 At the C terminus the structure of h4EHP diverges from the published eIF4E structures at Pro224 (Ser207 in eIF4E). In both proteins this marks the start of a flexible loop, which is disordered in h4EHP and in most of the structures of eIF4E present in the PDB. In eIF4E this loop is always followed by another strand (8) joining onto the central -sheet. In contrast, in h4EHP the equivalent residues take up a position at the back of the m7GTP binding site with Leu233 and Phe234 packing onto the hydrophobic portions of Arg174 and Phe175 (Figure 1(b)). Again, crystal contacts may influence this interaction, however the presence of an arginine (Arg197) instead of the glycine present at the equivalent position in eIF4E would sterically hinder the formation of another strand of the -sheet. eIF4E is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser209 that resides on the flexible loop between 4 and 8.21 In h4EHP the equivalent residue is an arginine (Arg226) and there is no residue nearby that could be phosphorylated instead. In eIF4E the arrangement has been described as a cupped hand. In h4EHP the hand would appear a little more closed, although this is due to the lengthening of the fingers rather than to any conformational change. m7GTP binding site

Structure of Human h4EHP

The m7GTP is well defined in the electron density (Figure 3(a)). As predicted,13 it binds with the guanine moiety sandwiched between Tyr78 and Trp124 and anchored by hydrogen bonding interactions with the side-chain of Glu125 and the main-chain of Trp124, in a similar fashion to that seen in eIF4E, where it is situated between two tryptophan residues (Trp56 and Trp103). Unexpectedly, however, the phenyl ring of the tyrosine in h4EHP adopts a spatially equivalent position, with respect to the m7GTP, to the six-membered ring of the tryptophan in eIF4E rather than to the five-membered ring that would be expected with a straight swap of the residues (see Figure 3(b) and (c)). This is due to the fact that Tyr78 resides on loop-12 that varies between the two proteins. With the guanine in the plane perpendicular to the direction of view and looking from Trp124, the phenyl ring of Tyr78 can be seen to be roughly in line with the six-membered ring of the tryptophan, with the C5 carbon atom at the interface of the fused ring of the m7GTP at the centre. Presumably this interaction centred on C5 is favourable. Extending away from the guanine moiety it can be seen that although the binding sites in the two proteins are quite similar, the details of the interactions made are very different with the ribose and triphosphate moieties adopting slightly different conformations in the two proteins. The hydrogen bonding interactions that the m7GTP makes with the protein are tabulated in Table 2 and shown in

Figure 3(b) and (c). From this it can be seen that the  and  phosphate groups contact protein residues directly while the ribose and -phosphate are only involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The -phosphate is anchored in place by a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of His110 while the phosphate interacts with the guanidium group of Arg174. This is different to the situation in eIF4E where His110 is replaced by a glycine and the equivalent of Arg174 interacts with the -phosphate rather than the -phosphate. In eIF4E there is an additional interaction between Lys162 and the phosphate that cannot be made in h4EHP because the equivalent residue is an isoleucine. Peptide binding site As discussed above, the ITC data demonstrate that the 4E-BP1 peptide binds to h4EHP. This peptide consists of residues Arg51BP1 to Val67BP1 of human 4E-BP1 and includes the recognition motif that has been defined for eIF4E (Tyr-X-X-X-X-Leu- (where X is variable and  is Leu, Met or Phe)22,23). The structure of the same peptide has been solved in complex with eIF4E.10 Since there is a difference in protein binding between h4EHP and eIF4E it was of interest to investigate whether a peptide containing this motif would bind in a similar manner to h4EHP as to eIF4E. In the structure, the peptide is clearly defined in the electron density for all residues apart from the last. Between residues Ile52 BP1 and Cys62BP1 it binds in a very similar manner to h4EHP with respect to how it is seen in the eIF4E structures (see Figure 4 and Table 3). This region includes residues Tyr54BP1 to Met60BP1 that define the boundaries of the recognition motif. The areas in which the tyrosine and leucine of this motif interact are conserved in h4EHP with respect to eIF4E, there being only one conservative mutation, from an

On the other hand Met60BP1, which occupies the position of the , is within 4.2 Å of a glutamic acid in h4EHP (Glu149) whereas in eIF4E the equivalent residue is a leucine. Marcotrigiano et al. comment that based on the structure it could be possible to have a hydrophilic amino acid such as lysine or arginine at this position.10 In h4EHP such a residue may well be favoured. The major difference between the binding of the peptides within this region is that in eIF4E the guanidinium group of Arg56BP1 forms a salt bridge involving both carboxyl oxygen atoms of a glutamate (Glu132), whereas in h4EHP the equivalent residue is an asparagine (Asn150), which only makes one hydrogen bond. Presumably this difference contributes to the higher affinity measured for the peptide binding to eIF4E with respect to h4EHP. At the N terminus of the peptide, Arg51BP1 adopts a similar confor-

698 mation in h4EHP to that seen with the identical peptide in eIF4E; however, the residues that it interacts with vary between the two proteins. In h4EHP, due to an insertion between residues 163 and 164, Glu164 is orientated differently from the corresponding amino acid in eIF4E (Asp147) and a tyrosine (Tyr58) replaces the asparagine seen in eIF4E. The structure of human eIF4E has also been solved in complex with a slightly longer peptide.12 In this structure Arg51BP1 adopts a different conformation with the guanidinium group interacting with a glutamine (Gln40) and the main-chain. Such a conformation would also be possible in h4EHP since the glutamine is conserved between the two proteins. The C-terminal residues of the peptide after Cys62BP1 are less well defined. Here there is a discrepancy between the two structures solved of eIF4E where the conformations of the main-chains are different. In h4EHP the conformation is more similar to that reported by Marcotrigiano et al.,10 although they could not see the residues beyond Asn64BP1. It appears, therefore, that the recognition motif that has been defined for eIF4E could also be applicable to h4EHP. Outside this motif, however, the proteins are more variable and this will influence which proteins are able to bind. Based on the structure it would also seem that the 4GII peptide could bind to h4EHP in the same conformation as seen in eIF4E.10 In explaining the lower affinity of the eIF4GII peptide with respect to the 4E-BP1 peptide in eIF4E, Marcotrigiano et al. commented that this may be due to the replacement of Arg51BP1 with a lysine in eIF4GII.10 This could also be the situation in h4EHP. eIF4GII also contains an arginine at the equivalent position of Arg56BP1 in 4E-BP1. Structure without m7GTP bound Due to the instability of eIF4E, it has proven difficult to obtain a crystal structure without ligand

bound either in the presence or absence of peptides. In contrast h4EHP(K45-F234) crystallises readily also in the absence of m7GTP, at least as a complex with the 4E-BP1 peptide. Extensive crystallisation screening was not carried out using the protein without the peptide bound; however, a CD spectra showed the protein to be folded (see Supplementary Data). The structure was solved, therefore, of the protein in complex with the 4E-BP1 peptide, from crystals that were isomorphous to those grown in the presence of m7GTP. The structure was refined at a resolution of 2.4 Å to an R-factor of 21.0% and a corresponding R-free of 24.9% (see Table 1). The final model contains protein residues from Val47 to Phe234; however, there are two stretches of polypeptide chain that were untraceable in the electron density (Pro72 to Glu79 and Ser220 to Leu227). It also includes 16 of the 17 residues of the peptide. The electron density does not show any evidence of a ligand in the m7GTP binding site. The structure of the unliganded protein is very similar to that solved with m7GTP bound, the r.m.s.d. between the two structures being 0.26 Å for all residues present in the unliganded structure. The major difference, however, is that the m 7 GTP binding site is not completely formed (see Figure 5). Residues Pro72 to Glu79 that are not seen belong to loop-12, which packs onto the m7GTP. Even when m7GTP is bound the temperature factors of this loop are higher than average for the structure. In the absence of m7GTP it is completely disordered. At the other side of the m7GTP site, the side-chain of Trp124 adopts a novel conformation in the absence of ligand, packing onto the aliphatic part of the sidechain of Glu125. The change in position of Trp124 appears also to be the reason that residues 220 to 227 are not visible in the electron density. In the m7GTPbound structure Ser220 and Ile221 are within van der Waals distance of the aromatic ring of Trp124. When the ligand is not present these residues are disordered, and were they to take the same position

699 binding site for the guanine moiety of the cap is not completely formed. It seems, therefore, that the first step in the binding of m7GTP to either h4EHP or eIF4E involves the interactions between the phosphates of the ligand and the protein. Given the structure of h4EHP, the next step may be the formation of the hydrogen bonds involving the guanine moiety. Only once the ligand has bound will the two aromatic residues that form the sandwich lock in place. Sequence conservation in 4EHP Sequences coding for 4EHP (eIF4E-2) are found in a wide variety of metazoans, plants and fungi.17 After aligning these sequences, it can be seen that the pattern of conservation is similar to that for eIF4E (eIF4E-1); however, there are distinct differences. In Figure 6 we have aligned the four sequences from eIF4E-2 for which data have been published, from Homo sapiens,13 A. thaliana,14 C. elegans15 and D. melanogaster16 and aligned them with the corresponding eIF4E-1 sequences from the same species. These include sequences from three different phyla of the animal kingdom as well as one from the plant kingdom. There is, however, no experimental data in the literature pertaining to eIF4E-2 from an organism from the kingdom of fungi, therefore a putative eIF4E-2 sequence from Coccidioides posadasii was selected from the eIF4E database17 to represent this class. On the other hand for eIF4E-1, the sequence from S. cerevisiae was included, since the structure of this protein has been solved. No eIF4E-2 has been identified in this species.1 The pattern of conservation that can be seen amongst these sequences is representative of the conservation of all known eIF4E-1 and eIF4E-2 sequences that can be downloaded from the eIF4E database. With regard to Figure 6 it can be seen that most of the residues involved in binding the m7GTP are conserved across species. Tyr78, Glu123 and Trp124, which interact with the guanine moiety of the m7 GTP, are invariant. Arg174, which is within hydrogen bonding distance of the -phosphate is an arginine in all of the eIF4E-2 sequences shown in the Figure apart from that in Drosophila where there is a conservative substitution to a lysine. Similarly, the only sequence where the equivalent of Asp112, which holds Arg174 in position, is not an aspartate is that from Drosophila where it is replaced by glutamic acid. This pattern of conservation is true of all the sequences extracted from the database, except in the protein from Anopheles gambiae, where the acidic and basic residues are switched, the arginine being replaced by a glutamic acid and the aspartic acid by an arginine. His110, which interacts with the phosphate, on the other hand, is not conserved. The flexible loop on which Tyr78 resides is also of variable length amongst the proteins from different species. This pattern of conservation amongst the

as they do when m7GTP is bound, would prevent Trp124 from adopting the new conformation. Whereas the positions of Tyr78 and Trp124 are affected by the ligand, the residues that are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the m7GTP (Glu125, Arg174 and His110) are unchanged by ligand binding (Figure 5). All three are held in place by other interactions with the protein: one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Glu125 is within hydrogen bonding distance of Trp124 and the sidechain is sandwiched between Trp124 and Met123; Arg174 is held in place by a salt-bridge interaction with Asp112 and the imidazole of His110 is flanked on one side by the side-chain of Arg174 and on the other by Pro69. The peptide adopts exactly the same conformation that is seen when the ligand is bound with the average temperature factor similar to that of the protein (see Table 1). Following the elucidation of the structure of unliganded h4EHP, the structure of human eIF4E in the apo form, determined by NMR, was reported.24 Although both structures show that in the absence of ligand the m7GTP binding site is not completely formed, in agreement with previous work that showed that eIF4E is much more flexible when m7GTP is not bound,25,26 the details of the conformational changes are different. As discussed above, in h4EHP the presence or absence of the ligand affects the loop containing Tyr78 dramatically but only causes the conformation of the side-chain of Trp124 to change. In the apo-eIF4E NMR structure, on the other hand, the reverse is true: the loop on which Trp56 (Tyr78) resides is modified only slightly in response to m7GTP binding and instead the loop containing Trp102 (Trp124) undergoes a large conformational change. Whereas the difference in the behaviour of the former loop is unsurprising, given the sequence variation between eIF4E and h4EHP, it is harder to explain why the region around Trp102/ 124 remains rigid in h4EHP but becomes much more mobile in eIF4E when the nucleotide is not present. In the crystal structure of h4EHP there is only a very slight increase in the average B-factor of this loop with respect to the rest of the protein. It cannot be excluded that the discrepancy is due to the difference in experimental conditions rather than to the variation between the proteins. In the NMR study this loop is not affected by the presence or absence of peptide.24 For the residues that interact with the phosphate Volpon et al. observed that in the apo eIF4E structure the positions of the side-chains of Arg157 and Lys162 are altered with respect to those seen when the ligand is bound. When a peptide derived from eIF4G is bound to the protein, however, the conformations of the respective sidechains are more similar to those observed when m7GTP is present. In h4EHP we do not see any difference in the conformations of the residues that hydrogen bond with the phosphate groups between the m7GTP-bound and unliganded structures but in both cases there is peptide present. Regardless of the differences between the two structures, it is clear that in the absence of ligand the

Figure 6. Sequence alignment of selected members of the eIF4E-2 and eIF4E-1 families (see the text). The sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W52 and the Figure prepared with Jalview.50 Some slight adjustment to the automatic alignment was made for the loop-12, to be more consistent with the structure. The annotations are as for Figure 1(a) and the scale above the sequence alignment is for human h4EHP. The colouring is according to CLUSTAL X with a 90% conservation cut-off.

residues interacting with the m7GTP reflects that between human eIF4E and h4EHP, i.e. the residues that are conserved amongst the eIF4E-2 sequences are also conserved between the two human proteins while His110 and the loop containing Tyr78 are not. The peptide binding site is also largely conserved. Of the residues that are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the peptide Trp95, Gly157 and Gln159 are absolutely conserved, Glu158 and Glu164 are always acidic, Asn150 can either be an asparagine or an aspartic acid and Gly163 is always small. Similarly residues Leu56 and Val91 that are situated in the hydrophobic core of the peptide binding site are absolutely conserved. On the other hand Pro55, Gln57 and Tyr58 are not conserved. These latter two residues interact with the N terminus of the peptide. This differs slightly to the situation in eIF4E-1 where the equivalent amino acids to Gln159, Asn150 and Gly163 are not conserved and there appears to be a more stringent requirement for a proline at position 55. In eIF4E-2 there are also a number of conserved residues that lie slightly outside the peptide binding site that have no apparent structural function. Arg103, Arg146 and Glu149, which are not conserved in eIF4E-1, are in close proximity with one another and may play a role when a protein rather than a short peptide binds. Further to the residues involved in m7GTP or peptide binding there are a number of residues that

are conserved in eIF4E-2 but not in eIF4E-1. For example, Arg138, Lys215 and Glu177 are situated at the lip of the m7GTP binding site, the side-chains of Lys215 and Arg138 being within 5 Å and 6 Å, respectively, of the -phosphate of the m7GTP with Arg138 held in place by a salt bridge interaction with Glu177. It should also be mentioned that Arg197, which would sterically hinder the C terminus from forming another strand of the -sheet as is seen in mammalian eIF4E and as discussed above, is conserved. eIF4E-2, therefore, is evolutionary conserved with a pattern of conservation that is distinct from eIF4E-1. Joshi et al. have defined members of the eIF4E-2 family as having a tyrosine equivalent to Tyr78.17 The above discussion shows that there are other residues important in defining the eIF4E-2 class. Comparison with other m7GTP binding proteins In addition to eIF4E a number of other proteins are known to bind the m7GpppN cap. Structures of proteins in complex with cap analogues have been solved for: the vaccinia virus-encoded mRNA capspecific 2-O-methyltransferase VP39;27 the nuclear cap-binding protein complex CBP20/80;28,29 the human scavenger decapping enzyme DCPS1;30 the reovirus polymerase 3 31 and the mRNA cap (guanine-N7) methyltransferase.32 Although there

701 of the tyrosine in h4EHP resembles that seen in the other proteins suggests that this is a very favourable arrangement. Given this, it is perhaps surprising that the affinity for the binding of m7GTP to h4EHP is so much lower than to eIF4E. Presumably the differences between the two proteins in the mode of binding of the phosphate and ribose moieties of the m7GTP as discussed above also contribute to this effect. CBP20/80, for example, has two tyrosine residues sandwiching the methylguanine but due to the extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the nucleotide and the protein interacts very tightly with m7GTP.28,29 As discussed above, in h4EHP and eIF4E the ligand binding site is not completely formed in the absence of m7GTP. Whereas, VP39 remains essentially unchanged whether the cap analogue is present or not, a rearrangement of the protein structure in response to nucleotide binding is also seen for CBP20/80.29,40 Here again, one of the aromatic residues that sandwich the guanine ring of the m7GTP belongs to a loop that is flexible in the absence of the ligand.

is no sequence homology between any of these proteins, there are clear similarities in the mode of binding of the m7G moiety to eIF4E, VP39, CBP20/ 80 and DCPS1 (see Figure 7). As observed in eIF4E and h4EHP, the m7G is sandwiched between two aromatic residues in VP39 (a tyrosine and a phenylalanine) and CBP20/80 (two tyrosine residues) and in DCPS1 by a tryptophan and a leucine as appears to be the situation in the eIF4E-3 family. 1,17 Furthermore, the N1 and N2 atoms of the guanine moiety are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with at least one acidic residue (Figure 7). This mode of binding has been much discussed in the literature, in particular with respect to eIF4E and VP39.2,33­36 The much higher affinity of m7GTP to the proteins with respect to GTP demonstrates the importance of the positive charge that is formed upon alkylation of the nucleobase.2,37 The interpretation of this is that there is partial charge transfer from the electron rich aromatic residue to the electron poor nucleotide, enhancing the ­ stacking interaction. From studies on model systems and investigations of the effects of mutations in cap binding enzymes it appears that the strongest interaction is seen with tryptophan, then tyrosine and then phenylalanine.29,38,39 Superposing the structures of eIF4E, VP39, CBP20/80 and DCPS1 on h4EHP based on the m7G moieties of their respective inhibitors it can be observed that the sixmembered rings of the stacking aromatic residues all adopt roughly similar positions (see Figure 7). Mazza et al. have commented that the aromatic residues in VP39 and CBP20/80 are orientated in almost exactly the same way,29 but that this is different to that of the tryptophan residues in eIF4E. In h4EHP the different conformation of loop-12 with respect to that seen in eIF4E allows Tyr78 to adopt a position that is more similar to the tyrosine in CBP20/80 (Figure 7). The structure of m7GTP bound to h4EHP, therefore, provides another example of this sandwich interaction between the positively charged nucleobase and the aromatic residues of the protein. The fact that the orientation

Conclusions
The ITC and structural results taken together with the sequence analysis strongly suggest that the physiological role of 4EHP is distinct from eIF4E but is likely to depend on both its cap and protein binding functions. As described in the Introduction, Cho et al. have described a mechanism in Drosophila in which d4EHP acting as a complex with Bicoid may fine-tune the translation of Caudal.19 Here both the 5 and 3 ends of the mRNA are anchored by the complex, the 5 end binding to the cap-binding site of d4EHP and the 3 end by Bicoid. While these proteins are only found in higher dipterans the mechanism of action may be more widespread. In the h4EHP structure in complex with the 4E-BP1 peptide there are a number of residues near to the peptide binding site that are conserved without an evident structural reason. It is possible, therefore,

The superposition was performed on all atoms of the methylated guanine. The labelled residues have the prefixes H for h4EHP, E for eIF4E, V for VP39, C for CBP20/80 and D for DCPS1.

702 that these residues may also be involved in protein­ protein binding interactions and that other proteins, or indeed full-length 4E-BP1 may bind more tightly to h4EHP than the relatively short 4E-BP1 peptide that has been measured in this study. It is attractive to speculate that partners for 4EHP will be found that act in a similar manner to Bicoid in interacting both with 4EHP and with the 3' end of the mRNA. In this case the 4EHP would be able to compete easily with eIF4E for the binding of the mRNA despite having a 100-fold lower affinity than eIF4E for m7GTP.

Structure of Human h4EHP inclusion bodies. The cells were grown and lysed as before except that after induction the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After lysis and centrifugation at 48,000g for 20 min the pellet was solubilised in a denaturant solution of 8 M guanidine-HCl and 1 mM DTT at 4 °C. This solution was then diluted 20-fold in refolding buffer (55 mM Mes (pH 6.5), 264 mM NaCl, 11 mM KCl, 1.1 mM EDTA, 550 mM guanidine-HCl, 550 mM arginine) and left for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein was then centrifuged at 48,000g, dialysed against a buffer containing 55 mM Mes (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl and run over a gel filtration column as described above. SDS­PAGE and mass spectrometry showed the protein to be pure and of the correct molecular mass. Limited proteolysis

Materials and Methods
Cloning cDNA containing full-length h4EHP was amplified from a human placenta library (Clonetech) using PCR. The forward primer (5-GCGCTGCATATGAACAACAAGTTCGACGCTTTGAAAGAT-3) contained an NdeI restriction site (in bold) and the reverse primer (5GCGCTGCTCGAGTCATGGCACATTCAACCGCGGCTTCC-3) an XhoI site. The product of this reaction was inserted into either Pet20b (Novagen) or a modified pGEX-6P2 (Amersham) vector, which had been engineered to create an NdeI site in place of the BamHI site. The constructs encoding for truncated forms of h4EHP were made in an analogous manner using the pGEX-6P2 vector containing the h4EHP DNA as the template in the PCR reaction. The primers that were used to create the construct from which the structure was solved (h4EHP(K45-F234)) were 5- CACTCACATATGAAGGCTGTTGTCCCTGGACCGGCA-3 and 5-CACTCACTCGAGTCAAAAAAGGAGCCTTTGGGG-3. Expression and purification For expression the plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen). The cells expressing the GST fusion proteins were grown in 2-YT medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6 whereupon they were induced with 1 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). They were harvested after an overnight incubation at 20 °C by centrifugation at 4000g, resuspended in PBS (Sigma), 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), and 50 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and lysed using a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 48,000g for 20 min and the supernatant loaded onto a column containing glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham). After washing the column with three column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the resin was incubated overnight with 2units/l PreScission protease (Amersham), in cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) at 4 °C and eluted with the same buffer. The eluant was applied to an XK Superdex 200, 16/60 column (Amersham) equilibrated at 4 °C with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT for gel filtration. Two closely spaced bands in an SDS­ PAGE gel at the correct molecular mass for h4EHP indicated that the full-length protein had undergone some proteolysis during purification. LC-MS showed this to be after Gly225 and Gln230. The protein corresponding to the shorter construct was seen to be pure and unproteolysed. The His-tagged protein was purified from The full-length re-folded h4EHP was diluted to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Aliquots of 5 g were then subject to digestion with trypsin (Fluka) using enzyme-to-substrate ratios ranging from 1:2500 to 1:10 (w/w) for 30 min at 30°. The reactions were blocked by adding Laemmli buffer and heating at 100° for 5 min. A trypsin-resistant domain was consistently detected as a major band at 20 kDa in a Coomassie-stained SDS­PAGE gel for the samples treated with intermediate E/S ratios (1:500 to 1:25). The N-terminal boundary of the domain was identified as Ala46 by Edman sequencing of the PVDF blotted band. LC-MS analysis yielded a molecular mass of 28,880 Da for the stable h4EHP fragment, consistent with Arg226 being the C-terminal residue. Isothermal titration calorimetry The protein was extensively dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT. Experiments were carried out at 20 °C with a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) with 10 M or 40 M protein in the cell and 100 m or 400 m cap analogue or peptide in the syringe. Experiments using the (h4EHP(K45-F234)) protein were carried out with m7 GTP, m7 GDP, m7 GMP (Sigma), m 7 GpppG, m7GpppA (New England Biolabs) and peptides corresponding to residues 51­67 of mammalian 4E-BP1 (RIIYDRKFLMECRNSPV; American Peptide Company) and residues 621­637 of mammalian eIF4GII (KKQYDREFLLDFQFMPA; American Peptide Company). GTP (Sigma) was also tested but here the concentration of the ligand in the syringe was increased to 10 mM. The binding of m7GTP to the full-length refolded protein was also measured. Each titration experiment consisted of a 5 l injection followed by 29 injections of 10 l. Data were fitted to a single binding site model using Origin (version 7.0 MicroCal). Crystallisation, data collection and refinement For crystallisation h4EHP(K45-F234) was concentrated to 5 mg/ml and 4E-BP1 peptide added to a concentration of 2 mM (RIIYDRKFLMECRNSPV; American Peptide Company). Crystals of the m7GTP bound and unbound proteins were grown under identical conditions. To form the complex m7GTP (Sigma) was added to the protein to a concentration of 2 mM. The crystals were grown using the hanging drop method at 4 °C. The wells contained 1 ml 20% (w/v) PEG-3000 and 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5) and the drops 1 l well liquor and an equal volume of

For data collection they were transferred briefly to an equivalent mother liquor containing 15% (v/v) glycerol and then plunged into liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100K on a Rigaku RAXIS IV detector mounted on an FRD rotating anode generator (Rigaku). The data were integrated with MOSFLM41 and scaled using SCALA.42 Further processing was carried out with the CCP4 suite of programs.43 The structure of the m7GTPbound protein was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP44 with the structure of eIF4E (PDB accession code 1IPB) as the search model. The structure was refined, initially in CNX200245 (Accelrys Ltd) interspersed with manual model building in O.46 The final cycles were carried out in Refmac.47 Water molecules were inserted using Arp/wARP.48 Crystals of the unliganded protein were isomorphous with those of the m7GTP bound protein. The structure was refined starting from the structure with m7GTP in a similar manner to above. Superposition of the molecules was carried out in LSQMAN49 such that all matching C pairs were <3.8 Å apart after the superposition. Protein Data Bank accession codes The structures have been deposited in the RCSB PDB with accession codes 2jgb and 2jgc.
