Recognition of Enolase in the Escherichia coli RNA Degradosome
Vidya Chandran and Ben F. Luisi*
Department of Biochemistry University of Cambridge 80 Tennis Court Road Cambridge CB2 1GA, UK In Escherichia coli, the glycolytic enzyme enolase is a component of the RNA degradosome, which is an RNase E mediated assembly involved in RNA processing and transcript turnover. The recruitment of enolase by the RNA degradosome has been implicated in the turnover of certain transcripts, and it is mediated by a small segment of roughly a dozen residues that lie within a natively unstructured sub-domain of RNase E. Here, we present the crystal structure of enolase in complex with its ° recognition site from RNase E at 1.6 A resolution. A single molecule of the RNase E peptide binds asymmetrically in a conserved cleft at the interface of the enolase dimer. The recognition site is well conserved in RNase E homologues in a subfamily of the g-proteobacteria, including enzymes from pathogens such as Yersinia pestis, Vibrio cholera and Salmonella sp. We suggest that enolase is recruited into putative RNA degradosome machinery in these bacilli, where it plays common regulatory functions.

Results and discussion The 48 kDa enolase is a universely conserved enzyme of glycolytic metabolism that is found in organisms from all three domains of life, namely, the archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes. The enzyme catalyses the interconversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and 2-phospho-D-glycerate, which proceeds through the reversible elimination of water (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolase; EC 4.2.1.11). In Escherichia coli, roughly one-tenth of the total enolase is sequestered in a multi-enzyme assembly known as the RNA degradosome.1 The three other principal components of this machine are an energy-dependent RNA helicase containing a DEAD-box motif that binds Mg-ATP (RhlB), the phosphoryltic exoribonuclease, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), and the endoribonuclease RNase E, which forms the scaffold for the entire assembly (Figure 1(a)).1­4 The C-terminal half of RNase E forms the key heterotypic protein-toprotein interactions of the RNA degradosome,5­7

and each of the recruited components brings a specialised role to the assembly. RNase E initiates the decay of most transcripts by internal cleavage, and it also processes the precursors of tRNA, rRNA, tmRNA and 6 S RNA.8­13 PNPase turns over RNA processively and functions to check the structural fidelity of ribosomal RNA.14 The RhlB helicase component of the degradosome uses the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to remove secondary structure from RNA to prepare the substrates for the partner nucleases. Thus, the components of the RNA degradosome cooperate to turn over structured transcripts with apparent processivity, and it is possible that the organization may also facilitate the processing of certain RNA species. While the role of the other degradosome components is well established, the function of the enolase is not so clear. However, an analysis of transcript levels using DNA microarrays has shown that disruption of enolase's interaction with RNase E in E. coli has consequences on the bulk turnover of mRNA, and in particular, on transcripts encoding enzymes of energy-generating metabolic routes.15,16 It has also been observed that the association of enolase with RNase E is required for the response to excess phosphosugar.17,18 This response involves the induction of a small regulatory RNA, sgrS which is recruited to the degradosome via the small RNA

binding protein, Hfq, resulting in the targeted destruction of the transcript encoding the transmembrane glucose transporter, ptsG.19 The physical interaction of enolase and RNase E is not required

for the induction of small regulatory RNA or the transcript turnover, so it remains unclear how enolase functions in the degradosome. One possible function of enolase is the localised generation of

10 phosphoenolpyruvate for an activating phosphotransfer reaction. Although it remains to be established, the function of enolase in the degradosome may serve to link cellular metabolic status with post-transcriptional gene regulation. In this study, we have co-crystallized enolase with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 833 to 850 from RNase E, which earlier studies have shown to lie within a recognition region mapped by a yeast two-hybrid assay5 and to be sufficient for binding enolase in solution.20 The complex crystallized in space group P21 with a pseudo-orthorhombic cell, and the crystals diffract to extraordinarily high resolution, providing a detailed view of the molecular recognition as well as an unparalleled perspective of the entire enzyme (data summarized in Table 1). The crystal structure ° of enolase was reported earlier at 2.5 A resolution;21 °. here, we report the complex at 1.6 A Enolase is a stable dimer in solution and in the crystal,21 and in the present co-crystals of the enolase/peptide complex, two such dimers

occupy the asymmetric unit. In both of these dimers, a well-ordered RNase E peptide penetrates an inter-protomer groove (Figure 1(b)). The complex was also crystallized in three other crystal forms with different symmetry (Table 1). In all three of these cases, the density for the peptide is averaged over two non-equivalent positions in the central cleft. While this made it difficult to prepare a model, it was nonetheless clear that the peptide occupies the same site in all crystal forms, even under different crystallisation conditions (Table 1). A model for the peptide­enolase complex was built and refined using the monoclinic data. The peptide intersects the molecular dyad of the enolase dimer to make non-equivalent contacts with the two protomers and leaving insufficient space for a second peptide. The observed stoichiometry of one RNase E peptide bound by one enolase dimer is consistent with the observations from nondissociating mass spectrometry.20 As RNase E is a homotetramer,22­24 it can in principle bind up to four enolase dimers.

An aqueous solution of recognition peptide was buffer-exchanged with a NAP-25 column equilibrated with 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.3). ¨ Enolase was purified as described by Kuhnel & Luisi21 and mixed with recognition peptide in a 1:1.5 molar ratio (2.3 mM enolase in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl). The crystals were grown at 20 8C by equilibration against reservoirs with conditions provided in the top column of the Table. The cells of both orthorhombic forms are related by permutation to the monoclinic cell, and with a near halving of one axis. Detectors at synchrotron sources were charge coupled devices and for the home source, an R-axis IV. The crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement using the model of the E. coli enolase dimer21 with the program MOLREP,29 improved using ARP/wARP30 and stereochemically refined using REFMAC5 with non-crystallographic restraints.31 The quality of the model was evaluated with PROCHECK.32 a Residues A335 and R398 are consistently outliers in the Ramachandran diagram (generously allowed and disallowed, respectively), but these can be accounted for by stabilizing hydrogen bonds to the peptide by side-chains. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the RCSB PDB with accession code 2FYM.

11 cleft of enolase (Figure 2(a)­(c)). The enolase dimer viewed along the dyad axis shows an electronegative groove that matches the electropositive recognition peptide (Figure 2(b) and (c)). The binding of peptide has little impact on the enolase structure. The peptide-bound and apo structures superimpose with a root-mean-square ° deviation of Ca atoms of 0.5 A. Compared to the peptide-free structure, there are small movements in loops in the N-terminal domain (not shown). It was found earlier that the interaction with RNase E has no effect on catalytic rates of enolase,20 and we observe here that the sites of catalysis and peptide binding are remote and do not communicate. The high-resolution electron density map also provides a clear image of the catalytic site (Figures 1(b) and 3). Enolase requires a stoichiometry of two divalent metal ions to catalyse the anti-b-elimination reaction.21 The electron density maps reveal a hydrated magnesium ion bound at the active site. The metal is coordinated by the non-eclipsing oxygen atoms of the carboxylates from D245, E289 and D316. An octahedral coordination sphere around the magnesium is completed by three water molecules. No density was seen for the second Mg ion, but this metal requires the substrate to complete its coordination site.

may exclude other degradosome components from the same RNase E protomer,19,20 so the exact stoichiometry of enolase in the context of the degradosome awaits experimental elucidation. The enolase structure can be divided into two architectural components (Figure 1(b)), which are labelled as the N-terminal domain and barrel domain in Figure 1(c). The major domain is a self-closing b-barrel from the triose-isomerase architectural family (the TIM barrel; blue in Figure 1(b)), and lying on the periphery is the second, helical domain that coincidently shares structural similarity to a domain found in another degradosome component, polynucleotide phosphorylase (tan in Figure 1(b)). The deep cleft where the RNase E peptide binds is formed between the N-terminal domains of the individual enolase protomers. The geometry of this cleft and the dimerisation surface are well conserved when comparing enolase from eukaryotes and prokaryotes.21 The termini of the peptide project into the solvent, where they could link to the remainder of the RNase E protein. Because the recognition peptide lies within a natively unfolded domain,20 access into the cleft would be flexibly accommodated. The surface of the peptide has shape and electrostatic complementarity to the inter-subunit

The Figure was prepared using LIGPLOT.26

Details of enolase recognition site and its conservation The RNase E peptide interacts with both the architectural domains of the enolase. Deeper in the cleft, the recognition peptide forms a single turn of a-helix. The peptide leaves the pocket as a strand flanked by the N-terminal domain on either side. The walls of the binding pocket are formed by the three-stranded antiparallel b-sheets (S1, S2 and S3) and helix 3 (H3) in the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal helix H12 of the b-barrel domain. Loops in the N-terminal domain between the second and third strand (S2 and S3) and between helices 3 and 4 (H3 and H4) also contribute to the binding pocket in enolase. The floor of the pocket is formed by the loop between strand S10 and helix 11 (S10-H11).

The details of the enolase/RNase E interaction are summarized schematically in Figure 2(d). The peptide forms mainly hydrogen bonding interactions as it enters the inter-protomer pocket and interacts with both enolase monomers. Lysine 119 of both enolase subunits form hydrogen bonds with E836 and S839 on either side of the helix turn. The helix turn is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the enolase and the peptide backbone. Other hydrogen bonding interactions are formed between the carbonyl oxygen of RNase E residue A838 and the backbone nitrogen of enolase residue M33; between the carbonyl oxygen of RNase E G840 and the terminal amide group of enolase Q407; and, between the terminal amino group of RNase E K841 with the carbonyl oxygen of enolase E375. The RNase E peptide

exits from the enolase-binding pocket as a loop, and forms hydrophobic interactions with the N-terminal b-strands of enolase. We sought to examine the conservation in other bacteria of the key residues involved in recognition of enolase and RNase E. We aligned the sequences from the carboxy-terminal domain of RNase E, and found that the region of contact is well conserved in many, but not all g-proteobacteria (Figure 4). The flanking regions vary greatly, but the key residues that mediate the interaction with enolase are well conserved, and a segment of roughly 20 residues forms a conserved motif. The motif is found in Gram-negative pathogens of animals and plants, such as Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Shigella flexneri and Erwinia carotovora. However, the enolase binding site is not found in the RNase E of more distant g-proteobacteria, such as Pseudomonas syringae, which is reported to form an equilibrium complex with the 3 0 -to-5 0 hydrolytic exoribonuclease RNase R.25 The peptide segment studied here is at the C-terminal portion of a greater segment that is conserved in the subgroup of the g-proteobacteria related to E. coli, and the crystal structure indicates that the residues of the N-terminal portion are

projected to exit the enolase binding pocket. It is not clear presently why the residues of the N-terminal portion are conserved, but they could make additional contacts with the exterior surface of the enolase or with one of the other degradosome partner proteins. Based on the pattern of punctuate sequence conservation, we suggest that the RNase E­ enolase interaction is likely to occur in the subfamily of g-proteobacteria identified here. Furthermore, multiple sequence alignments of other portions of the C-terminal domain of RNase E reveal conserved regions that are implicated in protein­protein or protein­RNA interactions in the E. coli enzyme (see, for example, segment 780 to 820 in Figure 4). This implies that the RNase E-based degradosome machinery is conserved with similar organisation amongst a subfamily of the g-proteobacteria. Of particular relevance for this report, the conservation of the enolase binding site suggests its important functional role in the degradosome assembly that might be related to the response to signals from phosphosugar stress and other conditions. Through these heterotypic protein­ protein interactions, the degradosome may serve
