Abstract S100A13 is a homodimeric protein that belongs to the S100 subfamily of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins. S100A13 exhibits unique physical and functional properties not observed in other members of the S100 family. S100A13 is crucial for the non-classical export of acidic fibroblast growth factors (FGFs-1), which lack signal peptide at their N-terminal end. In the present study, we report the three-dimensional solution structure of Ca2+-bound S100A13 using a variety of 3D NMR experiments. The structure of S100A13 is globular with four helices and an antiparallel b-sheet in each subunit. The dimer interface is formed mainly by an antiparallel arrangement of helices H1, H1 0 , H4, and H4 0 . Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments show that S100A13 binds non-cooperatively to four calcium ions. Prominent differences exist between the three-dimensional structures of S100A13 and other S100 proteins. The hydrophobic pocket that largely contributes to protein≠protein interactions in other S100 proteins is absent in S100A13. The structure of S100A13 is characterized by a large patch of negatively charged residues flanked by dense cationic clusters contributed largely by the positively charged residues located at the C-terminal end. Results of ITC experiments reveal that S100A13 lacking the C-terminal segment (residues 88≠98) fails to bind FGF-1. The three-dimensional structure of S100A13 not only provides useful clues on its role in the non-classical export of signal peptide-less proteins such as FGF-1 but also paves the way for rational design of drugs against FGF-induced tumors. ” 2005 Elsevier Inc.

S100 proteins are a family of calcium binding proteins which exhibit divergent cell and tissue-specific expression [1,2]. Members of the S100 family of proteins are intricately involved in a number of human diseases and are also useful in clinical diagnostics [3]. S100A13 is a $12 kDa protein that is selectively expressed in heart, kidney, spleen, and small intestine. S100A13 shares only about 50% amino acid sequence homology with other members of the S100 family [2]. Interestingly, polyclonal antibodies raised against S100A13 fail to cross-react with other S100 proteins [4].

S100A13 exhibits several properties which are different from those of a typical member of the S100 family [4]. S100A13 contains two sets of calcium binding sites with significantly different affinities [4]. On the other hand, other S100 proteins display positive cooperativity for the four calcium binding sites in their dimeric structure [1]. The molecular mechanism of activation of S100 proteins in the presence of calcium involves the exposure of two hydrophobic patches which provide the interaction surface for the target proteins [6]. In marked contrast, in the presence of calcium a drastic decrease in the solvent-exposed non-polar surface is observed in S100A13 [5]. Therefore, it is believed that the mechanism of activation of S100A13 is distinctly different from

those of the other S100 members. In addition, S100A13 is the only member of the S100 family that is shown to be involved in the non-classical export of signal-peptide-less proteins such as fibroblast growth factors, interleukin 1a, and synaptotagmins [6≠8]. S100A13 is reported to regulate the formation of the acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) multiprotein release complex [9]. Formation of the multiprotein release complex is believed to be the most crucial step in the secretion of FGF-1 to the extracellular compartment [9]. Determination of the three-dimensional solution structure of S100A13 is crucial to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the secretion of FGF-1 by the non-classical pathway. It is in this context, in the present study, we report the three-dimensional solution structure of mouse S100A13 using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.

Methods and materials
Protein expression and purification. cDNA containing S100A13 was amplified by the polymerase chain (PCR). An amplified fragment was subcloned into the pGEX-6 expression vector (Pharmacia). Overexpression of the protein was achieved in Escherichia coli. 15N or the 15 N,13C-labeled S100A13 was prepared by growing the cells in M9minimal medium containing only 15N-labeled NH4Cl and 13C-labeled glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused S100A13 was purified by affinity chromatography on GST≠Sepharose resin (Pharmacia). The affinity tag was cleaved by treatment with thrombin (Sigma) and the protein (S100A13) was repurified to homogeneity on GST≠Sepharose resin. Fluorescence ANS emission. The 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) emission experiments were performed using a Hitachi F-2500 spectrofluorometer at 25 ∞C. Fluorescence spectra were collected using an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength range of 400≠600 nm. Ca2+ was added from a 1 M stock solution of CaCl2 prepared in the storage buffer (pH 6.8) containing 25 mM KCl and 25 mM Tris≠HCl. Control experiments with ANS were carried out under the same buffer conditions, but in the absence of the protein. The final concentrations of the protein and ANS used were, 50 and 50 lM, respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were performed using a Microcal VP titration calorimeter (Northampton, MA, USA). Samples were centrifuged and precipitates, if any, were removed before titration. The titration consisted of injecting 5≠10 lL aliquots of 1 mM ligand (S100A13) solutions into a 0.1 mM solution of FGF-1 after every 3.5 min to ensure that the titration peak returned to the baseline prior to the next injection. In order to measure the heats of dilutions of the ligand, the protein solutions were injected into the reaction buffer [25 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 6.8) containing 25 mM KCl] in separate ITC runs. NMR spectroscopy and assignments. NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker AVANCE DMX-700 MHz spectrometer with a 5 mm triple resonance inverse cryoprobe. The concentrations of protein samples used for all spectra were in the range of 0.7≠1 mM. Protein solutions were prepared in d6 Tris≠HCl containing 25 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.03% of NaN3. All NMR samples were prepared either in 90% H2O and 10% D2O or 100% D2O. Sequential resonance assignments were achieved using standard triple resonance experiments. NOE data used for the structure calculation were extracted from 3D 15N- and 13C-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra

in H2O, acquired with a mixing time of 100 ms. In addition, a 3D C-separated NOESY-HSQC spectrum was recorded in D2O with a mixing time of 100 ms. Backbone / and w angle restraints were obtained from TALOS using backbone chemical shift information (1H, 15N, and 13C) [10]. All NMR data were processed with XWINNMR (version 3.5) and analyzed using Sparky [11] software. TSP-d4 was used as an internal reference for 1H chemical shifts and as an external reference for 13C chemical shifts. 15N chemical shift was referenced indirectly [12]. Structure calculations. Distance restraints were used for the structure calculation extracted from 15N- and 13C-separated NOESY-HSQC data. A total of 1445 distance restraints were used for the calculation and the distance constraints were classified as strong, medium, and weak, the corresponding restraint limits were 0.0≠3.0, ∞ 0.0≠4.0, and 0.0≠5.0 A, respectively. NOEs across the dimer interface were identified from 13C-seperated NOESY-HSQC spectra [13≠15]. In total 60 inter-subunit NOEs were uniquely identified. The structures were calculated iteratively using ARIA/CNS (version 1.1) using PARALLHDG 5.3 forcefield in the PARALLHDG mode [16]. The dimer structure was calculated starting from random coordinates of the monomer. To uniformly maintain the symmetry axis, a non-crystallographic symmetry restraint with a weightage of 10.0 was applied throughout the calculation process [17]. The quality of the calculated structure was assessed using PROCHECK analysis [18].

Results and discussion Calcium binding affinity of S100A13 Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a versatile technique to monitor protein≠metal or protein≠ligand interactions [19]. ITC experiments not only permit estimation of binding affinities between interacting molecules but also provide useful information on binding stoichiometry and the thermodynamics governing the interaction between two molecules. In this context, the thermodynamics of binding of Ca2+ to S100A13 is investigated using ITC. The binding isotherm representing the interaction of Ca2+ ions to S100A13 is nearly sigmoidal and proceeds with the evolution of heat (exothermic) (Fig. 1). The change in enthalpy (DH = ¿4.5 kcal mol¿1) of binding is negative, suggesting that charge interactions play a dominant role in the binding of Ca2+ ions to S100A13. These results are consistent with the involvement of acidic residues (Asp and Glu) located in the EF-hands, in the binding of Ca2+ ions. The Ca2+-S100A13 titration curve saturates at a protein to metal ion ratio of 1:4, suggesting that two Ca2+ ions bind per S100A13 monomer (Fig. 1). The binding affinities of the two Ca2+ binding sites are $8 lM (Kd1) and $66 lM (Kd2). In marked contrast, other S100 proteins such as S100A3, S100A4, S100A5, S100A6, and S100A11 exhibit a positive cooperativity wherein all the four calcium ions bind to the protein(s) with equal affinity [20]. The presence of high affinity and low affinity binding sites is unique to S100A13 and not observed in any other member of the S100 protein family.

Effects of Ca2+ ions on the exposure of non-polar surface(s) The response to Ca2+ binding in typical S100 proteins has been studied extensively [21,22]. The binding of Ca2+ to S100 proteins leads to a drastic opening of the EF-hand domains which in turn significantly increases the solventaccessible hydrophobic surface(s). The exposed non-polar surface(s) acts as recognition and binding sites for target molecules. 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) is a fluorescent probe that is known to reliably report conformational transitions that result in changes to the solvent-exposed non-polar surfaces [22]. In this context, we monitored the changes in the solvent-accessible nonpolar surface(s) in S100A13 using ANS binding experiments. ANS binds strongly to apo-S100A13 and exhibits an emission signal centered at 490 nm, indicating the presence of large areas of solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface(s) in the protein (Fig. 2). The emission intensity at 490 nm shows a steady decrease with the increase in the concentration of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, inset). In addition, the emission maximum of ANS shows a progressive redshift with increasing additions of Ca2+. These results suggest decreased solvent accessibility of the non-polar surface(s) in the Ca2+-bound state of the protein. The changes in ANS fluorescence are complete at a Ca2+ concentration of 300 lM. The decrease in the solvent-exposure of hydrophobic surfaces upon addition of Ca2+ is unique to S100A13 [4]. As mentioned earlier, other S100 proteins, upon binding to Ca2+, show a drastic

increase in the solvent-exposed non-polar surface(s). It appears that S100A13 recognizes its interacting protein partners by an entirely different mechanism than the one adopted by a majority of other S100 proteins. Ca2+-bound state of S100A13 binds to FGF-1 As mentioned earlier, S100A13 participates in the nonclassical export of FGF-1 [8]. In this context, it is important to examine if Ca2+-bound S100A13 physically binds to FGF-1. In this context, we investigated the binding affinity of Ca2+-bound S100A13 to FGF-1 using isothermal titration calorimetry. S100A13 binds to FGF-1 with a moderate binding affinity (Kd $ 80 lM, Fig. 3A). The binding affinity of S100A13 to FGF-1 is in the same range as that reported for other S100 with their corresponding protein partners [1,2]. The S100A13≠FGF-1 interaction is endothermic (DH = 16.51 kcal mol¿1). The binding isotherm tends to saturate at a S100A13 monomer to FGF-1 ratio of 1:1, suggesting that two molecules of FGF-1 possibly bind to one molecule of the S100A13 dimer (Fig. 3A). The results of the ITC experiments unambiguously show that Ca2+-bound S100A13 is the functionally active form capable of binding to FGF-1. Ca2+ binding triggers a conformational change in the protein H≠15N HSQC spectrum is a finger-print of the backbone conformation of the protein [23]. Each crosspeak in the spectrum represents the microenvironment of an

amino acid residue in the protein. Therefore, conformational transitions induced in the protein upon addition of ligand≠metal ion can be conveniently studied by examining the 1H≠15N chemical shift perturbation of individual crosspeaks in the 1H≠15N HSQC spectrum. The dispersion of crosspeaks in the 1H≠15N HSQC spectrum of apo-S100A13 is relatively less (Fig. 4A). There is considerable overlap of crosspeaks in the spectrum, suggesting that portions of the S100A13 molecule are relatively unordered. Addition of Ca2+ beyond 100 lM results in dramatic changes to the HSQC spectrum, indicating that the metal ion induces conformational changes in the protein. The 1H≠15N HSQC spectrum in the Ca2+-bound state of S100A13 is well dispersed, suggesting that additional portions of the protein molecule become ordered upon binding to the metal ion (Fig. 4B). Resonance assignment and quality of the structure Size-exclusion chromatography data show that Ca2+bound S100A13 exists as a homodimer (data not shown). All the crosspeaks in the 1H≠15N HSQC spectrum of the Ca2+-bound S100A13 have been unambiguously assigned [24]. The backbone and side-chain resonance assignments of the Ca2+-bound S100A13 were determined from the information content of a set of two- and three-dimensional NMR experiments. Ambiguities in the assignment of side-chain resonances of Arg26, Asn34, and Lys51 were resolved using HCCH-TOCSY, HCC(CO)NH-TOCSY, and 13C-edited NOESY data.

The inset figure depicts an expansion of the boxed region (in the range of 7.8≠8.6 and 118≠124 ppm) of the 1H≠15N HSQC spectrum and encircled crosspeaks represent residues which are located upstream of the N-terminal end of the protein. The spectra were acquired in 25 mM d6≠Tris≠HCl (pH 6.8) containing 25 mM KCl. The concentration of protein used was 0.5 mM. The Ca2+-bound S100A13 spectrum was acquired under the same conditions in the presence of 300 lM CaCl2.

The high resolution solution structure of Ca2+-bound S100A13 was determined using a total of 1445 distance constraints (750 intra-residue, 495 medium range, and about 200 long range constraints per subunit). A total of 60 inter-subunit constraints define the dimer interface structure of S100A13. Fig. 5 shows a superposition of an ensemble of 20 structures of the Ca2+-bound S100A13. The final representative ensemble of structures shows low molecular and constraint violation energies, with ∞ no distance violations greater than 5 A. PROCHECK analysis of the structures indicated good stereochemistry for the bond angle and bond lengths, and showed that 98.9% of all non-glycine residues fall within the favorable region of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1).

Description of the three-dimensional structure of Ca2+-bound S100A13 The structure of S100A13 has an approximate C2 symmetry. The structure of S100A13 consists of four helices within each monomer (Fig. 5). These helices were identified on the basis of NOE patterns and backbone dihedral angle analysis. The rmsd of the secondary structured region of the S100A13 dimer relative to the ∞ mean structure is 0.49 ± 0.01 A for the backbone atoms ∞ and 0.67 ± 0.01A for all heavy atoms. A short antiparallel b-sheet is located in each monomer in the Ca2+binding loops involving residues, Lys30 to Asn34 (in loop-1) and Glu70 to Ser74 (in loop-2). The four helices

form a pair of helix≠loop≠helix motifs (EF-hand motifs). The N-terminal EF-hand (EF-1) consists of helix H1 (Glu8 to Thr22), a calcium-binding loop (Phe23 to Asn34, loop-1), and helix H2 (Gly35 to Gln45) (Fig. 5). The C-terminal EF hand (EF-2) consists of helix H3 (Gln55 to Glu 68), helix H4 (Tyr76 to Arg96), and a calcium binding loop (Ser69 to Glu75) connecting helix H3 and helix H4 (Fig. 5). There is a hinge region (Gln46 to Gly54) that connects the two EF-hand motifs. The dimer interface in S100A13 is formed by an antiparallel arrangement of helices, H1, H1 0 , H4, and H4 0 . The solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket is absent in the structure of the Ca2+-bound state of S100A13 The structural transitions induced by Ca2+ in S100 proteins are best explained by the ``change in hand'' mechanism [25]. The most dramatic Ca2+-induced

conformational transition in S100 proteins is the remarkable change in the inter-helical angle between helices H3/H3 0 and H4/H4 0 which flank the canonical Ca2+-binding loop located in the C-terminal EF-2 hand. The Ca2+-induced conformational change essentially modifies the angle of the two defining helices in the EF-2 hand from the negative to positive interhelical angle. Binding of Ca2+exposes a cleft, defined mostly by non-polar residues in the hinge region between helix H3/H3 0 and helix H4/H4 0 (Fig. 6). Residues in the C-terminal helix (helix H4/H4 0 ) largely contribute to the large solvent-exposed non-polar surface generated by the conformational change induced by Ca2+. The solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket plays a crucial role in the interaction of S100 proteins with their target protein partners [1,26≠28]. The presence of solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface in the Ca2+-bound states of S100 proteins is easily identified by ANS binding studies. In this context, it would be interesting to understand the structural basis for the weak ANS binding affinity of Ca2+-bound S100A13. We believe that the ``change in hand'' mechanism also operates when Ca2+ binds to S100A13. The structure of the Ca2+-bound state of S100A13 lacks the prominent hydrophobic cluster observed in the three-dimensional structures of other S100 proteins (Fig. 6). In S100A13, the drift of the helix H4/H4 0 away from helix H3/H3 0 does not appear to generate large solvent-exposed non-polar surface(s), as observed in other S100 proteins (Fig. 6). This is possibly because the helix (which largely contributes to the solvent-exposed non-polar surface in the Ca2+-bound states of other S100 proteins) in S100A13 is rich in charged residues. In fact, 9 of the 11 residues in the Cterminal end are charged [2]. In addition, the conserved hydrophobic residues (Phe43, Ala83, Phe87, and Phe88) commonly found in the solvent-exposed hydrophobic pockets in the Ca2+-bound states of S100 proteins are absent in S100A13 (Fig. 6). At the present juncture, in

Fig. 6. Comparison of the structures of the Ca2+-bound states of S100A13 and S100A6. In S100A6, a prominent hydrophobic pocket (green), located between helix H3 and helix H4, is exposed to the solvent upon binding to Ca2+. The conserved solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket is absent in the structure of the Ca2+-bound S100A13. The absence of the conserved hydrophobic pocket shows that S100A13 recognizes and binds to protein partners (like FGF-1) by a mechanism different from that conventionally adopted by other members of the S100 protein family.

the absence of a three-dimensional structure of apoS100A13, we do not have a concrete explanation for the high ANS binding affinity of the Ca2+-free state of S100A13. It is possible that the stretch of non-polar residues (Val16, Val17, Phe20, Phe21, Phe23, and Ala24) located in loop-1 of the EF-1 hand forms a solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket (in apo-S100A13) which is capable of binding to ANS. This hydrophobic pocket is possibly buried in the interior of the structure of Ca2+-bound S100A13. Interestingly, estimation of solvent-accessibility of residues in the structure of Ca2+bound S100A13 using the software, NACCESS (http://wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess), reveals that the hydrophobic stretch of residues located in the EF-1 hand is not solvent-exposed (data not shown). We emphasize that currently this proposal is purely speculative and a more detailed characterization of the three-dimensional structure of apo-S100A13 is required for its justification. In summary, the absence of the solvent-exposed non-polar pocket in the three-dimensional solution structure of the Ca2+-bound state of S100A13 strongly suggests that the molecular mechanism by

which S100A13 recognizes and binds to its protein partner(s) is different from other S100 proteins. S100A13 exhibits a unique surface charge distribution Protein≠protein interactions are highly specific. For example, it is often observed that member of a protein family will recognize a particular binding partner, despite the fact that all other family members may have an essentially identical fold [29]. Findings of various surveys suggest that the distribution of surface charges largely contributes to protein≠protein interactions [30]. In this context, we compared the surface charge potential of S100A13 with that of S100A6, a representative member of the S100 protein family. S100A13 shows an interesting pattern of distribution of surface charges (Fig. 7). One face of the S100A13 molecule displays a dense continuous patch of negatively charged residues contributed by acidic residues located in helix H1/H1 0 . The patch of negatively charged residues is flanked by a dense cationic cluster contributed by positively charged residues (residues 88≠98) located

at the C-terminal end. This unique distribution of surface charges in S100A13 is not shared by other members of the S100 family. Interestingly, the other S100 proteins examined do not exhibit the surface charge distribution observed in S100A13 (Fig. 7). The surface charge distribution pattern in S100A13 appears to be functionally important. In this context, it would be interesting to note that Landriscina et al. [31] showed that the deletion mutant of S100A13 (DS100A13), lacking residues 88≠98 at the C-terminal end, fails to form the FGF-1 release complex (consisting of FGF1, S100A13, and synaptotagmin). To examine if the positively charged C-terminal segment (residues 88≠ 98) is involved in interaction with FGF-1, we studied the binding affinity of the DS100A13 mutant to FGF1 using ITC. Results of the ITC experiments show that the DS100A13 mutant fails to bind or binds very weakly to FGF-1 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the positively charged residues at the C-terminal end of S100A13 are indeed involved in interaction with FGF-1. The ITC data analyzed in conjunction with the findings of Landriscina et al. [31] suggest that the interaction of S100A13 with FGF-1 is crucial for the formation of the FGF-1 release complex. Availability of the three-dimensional solution structure of S100A13 is expected to provide the necessary impetus for intensive research towards understanding the non-classical secretion of signal peptide-less proteins such as FGF-1. In addition, the structure of S100A13 also provides valuable clues for the rational design of potent drugs that inhibit FGF-mediated pathogenesis by selectively blocking the S100A13-FGF interaction.
