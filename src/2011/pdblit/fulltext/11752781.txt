Crystal structures of the nitric oxide reductase cytochrome P450nor (P450nor) in the ferric resting and the ferrous carbonmonoxy (CO) states have been determined at 1.00 and Ê 1.05 A resolution, respectively. P450nor consists of 403 aminoacid residues (46 kDa) and is one of the largest proteins re®ned to this resolution so far. The ®nal models have conventional R factors of 10.2% (ferric resting) and 11.7% (ferrous CO), with mean coordinate errors of 0.028 (ferric Ê resting) and 0.030 A (ferrous CO) as calculated from inversion of the full positional least-squares matrix. Owing to the atomic resolution, novel features are found in the re®ned structures. Firstly, two orientations of the haem are observed both in the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states. Secondly, a disordered water molecule bound to the haem iron is found in the ferric resting state. In addition, the accurate structures at atomic resolution enabled the examination of general stereochemical parameters that are commonly used in re®nement cycles of protein structures.

1. Introduction
The use of tunable high-intensity well collimated X-rays from synchrotron-radiation sources together with the development of cryotechniques have enabled the improvement of diffraction data quality and, in many cases, attainment of atomic resolution (AR). According to a de®nition suggested by Ê Sheldrick (1990), AR data should extend to at least 1.2 A, with 50% or more of the theoretically measurable re¯ections in the outer range having I > 2'(I). Most of the AR structures are still restricted to small proteins, but some AR structures with molecular weights greater than 40 kDa have been reported (Tame et al., 1996; Tame, 2000; Ermler et al., 1997; Matsumoto et al., 1999; Luan et al., 2000; Foadi et al., 2000). These AR data sets will be useful to examine the applicability of ab initio phasing techniques to larger macromolecules, as well as to validate the stereochemical parameters that are used routinely in the re®nement cycles of protein structures. The availability of larger protein structures re®ned to AR will bene®t a library of stereochemical target values by adding proteins with different folds with different percentages of secondarystructure elements (EU 3-D Validation Network, 1998). The bene®ts of AR have been reviewed recently (Longhi et al., 1998; Dauter et al., 1995, 1997). The nitric oxide reductase cytochrome P450nor (P450nor) from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum is a haem enzyme which consists of 403 amino-acid residues (46 kDa), a relatively large protein molecule for structural studies at AR. Since the Ê structure was determined at 2.0 A resolution at room temperature (Park, Shimizu, Adachi, Nakagawa et al. 1997),

efforts have been made to elucidate the catalytic mechanism by which the enzyme reduces NO to N2O. The X-ray structure of native and mutant P450nor at cryogenic temperature Ê (100 K) and at 1.7 A resolution revealed that a network of water molecules in a wide cavity near the catalytic site plays a crucial role as a proton-delivery path (Shimizu, Obayashi et al., 2000). During the course of these studies, the crystallization conditions have been re®ned to enable us to obtain Ê crystals that can provide data sets to 1.00 A resolution. In addition, intense well collimated short-wavelength X-rays, cryocooling devices and fast-readout CCD detectors have become available at third-generation synchrotron facilities, which allowed us to collect the AR data set using only one crystal. Here, we report the AR structures of the ferric resting and the ferrous carbonmonoxy (CO) forms of P450nor.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization and data collection

Crystals of the ferric form were obtained by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using 36% PEG 4000, 0.1 M MES, 10% glycerol at pH 7.0 and were improved by the use of microseeding (Park, Shumizu, Adachi, Shiro et al., 1997). Crystals grow in approximately 3 or 4 d to typical dimensions of 0.6 Â 0.4 Â 0.4 mm. The crystals can be cryocooled directly in the mother liquid without adding cryoprotectant. Some crystals were converted to the CO complex by soaking in COsaturated mother liquid in the presence of sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4). The crystals were ¯ash-frozen in liquid ethane. For data collection, the ¯ash-frozen crystal was transferred to a stream of cold nitrogen gas at 100 K. The diffraction data were collected at the SPring-8 beamline BL44B2 (RIKEN Structural Biology Beamline II) using a MAR CCD 165 detector (Adachi et al., 2002). Relatively short wavelength X-rays Ê Ê (! = 0.70 A) were selected in order to record data to 1.0 A resolution in the detector area of 165 mm diameter and to reduce absorption effects. Two data sets at different resolution Ê ranges (1.0±1.9 and 1.8±10 A) were collected in order to maximize the coverage of the dynamic range of the intensities. The oscillation angles, ranges and crystal orientation were optimized with DPS/MOSFLM (Rossmann & van Beek, 1999; Leslie, 1992). All data were indexed and integrated with DPS/ MOSFLM and scaled using programs from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Data-collection and processing parameters are summarized in Table 1. No signi®cant decay was detected as judged by I/' over the course of data collection. 1 745 175 and 2 238 315 observations were merged to give 204 021 and 175 256 unique re¯ections for the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states, respectively. The completeness of the two data sets is more Ê than 90% in the 30.0±1.0 A range.
2.2. Structural refinement

  ² Rmerge = jIi À hIij/ jIi j, where Ii is the intensity of an observation and hIi is the mean value for that   re¯ection and the summations are over all re¯ections. ³ R factor =   jFo hj À jFc hj/ Fo h, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively. The free R factor was calculated with 5% of   2 2 2 the data. § wR2 = { wFo À Fc 2 / wFo 2 1a2 }. } Estimated standard deviations (e.s.d.s) calculated from inversion of the full positional least-squares matrix.

Structural re®nements of the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states were carried out using the same procedures. The

Ê structure at 1.7 A resolution (Shimizu, Park et al., 2000) was used as the starting model in each case. Attempts at ab initio phasing using ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1997, 1999) were not successful for either data set. More conventional re®nement was therefore used instead. 5% of the re¯ections were set aside for cross-validation analysis by means of Rfree. Initial rigid-body re®nement was carried out using X-PLOR Ê È (Brunger, 1992) in the 6.0±2.3 A resolution range and simulated-annealing protocols were employed. The resolution Ê was increased stepwise from 2.3 to 1.3 A. After each step, 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron-density maps were calculated and the model was rebuilt if necessary using TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1989). The re®nement of the ferric resting state led to an R factor of 24.2% and an Rfree of 27.3%. This model contains about 360 water molecules and no multiple conformations were modelled in this step. This model was further re®ned using the conjugate-gradient least-squares (CGLS) method with SHELX97 (Sheldrick, 1997). The weighting scheme was ®xed at `WGHT 0.1'. SWAT was applied to correct the effect of bulk solvent. After each re®nement cycle, the difference Fourier map was analyzed automatically to ®nd solvent sites (the highest peaks at sites

where a water molecule forms no bad contacts and makes at least one geometrically plausible hydrogen bond to a polar atom). The corresponding solvent sites were automatically appended in the output ®le. After every run, solvent atoms which had either electron density lower than 1.5' in the 2Fo À Fc map and 3' in the Fo À Fc solvent omit map or B Ê factors of higher than about 60 A2 were removed. The shortest distance acceptable for solvent±solvent and solvent±protein Ê pairs of atoms was 2.25 A and the maximum hydrogen-bond Ê . The porphyrin and CO structures distance was set to 3.3 A were re®ned with distance restraints. In this procedure, the Ê resolution was increased stepwise from 1.3 to 1.0 A. The re®nement of the ferrous CO state converged to an R factor of 22.2% and an Rfree of 25.0%. After this step, anisotropic re®nement was carried out with several conjugate-gradient cycles using the maximum resolution. The restraints of the CO ligand and porphyrin were gradually removed and the ®nal CGLS re®nement was performed without any restraints. The ®rst round of anisotropic re®nement resulted in a sharp fall in the R factor to 16.8% and in the Rfree to 21.1% (the ferric resting form). After each re®nement round, alternative conformations for the side chains and main chains were introduced. The occupancies of the components of each conformation were individually re®ned and their sum was constrained to unity. Solvent sites in the vicinity of disordered side chains were selected as partially occupied. H atoms were included as riding atoms, lowering the R values by more than 1.0%. In this stage of model building, a glycerol molecule was substituted for water molecules. After 120 CGLS cycles, in which additional solvent molecules and alternative conformations were introduced, anisotropic re®nement of 403 protein residues, one porphyrin, one glycerol and approxiÊ mately 900 water molecules with data in the range 10.0±1.0 A converged with an R factor of 10.9% and an Rfree of 14.6% (the ferric resting form). This model was further re®ned using the block-matrix least-squares calculation in SHELX97, where each block consisted of 20±40 residues overlapping by one residue with the adjacent block. At the ®nal stage of the re®nement, a full-matrix least-squares calculation was carried out in order to obtain the estimated atomic coordinate errors by matrix inversion. All restraints were switched off for this calculation. The ®nal R factor and Rfree were 10.2 and 13.9% Ê for 203 704 re¯ections between 10.0 and 1.00 A for the ferric resting state and 11.7 and 15.2% for 175 082 re¯ections Ê between 10.0 and 1.05 A for the ferrous CO state, respectively. The ®nal statistics for the re®ned models are listed in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Overall quality of the electron-density maps

Fig. 1 shows the overall fold of the P450nor. As expected, the quality and the detail of the electron-density map were drastically improved at this resolution compared with the map Ê at 1.7 A resolution. Fully anisotropic re®nement of P450nor resulted in remarkable improvements in the ®nal map. Most of the individual atoms have spherical or ellipsoidal electron densities in the 2Fo À Fc map contoured at 3.5'. The expected conformation of the histidine imidazole ring is con®rmed by the visible difference between N and C atoms. The correct conformation of most asparagine and glutamine residues can also be determined directly from the electron density. The re®nement with anisotropic thermal parameters against Ê diffraction data to 1.00 and 1.05 A resolution converged to R factors of 10.2 and 11.7% for the ferric resting and ferrous CO states, respectively. No electron density was seen around the N-terminal four residues in the lower resolution structure of P450nor (Park, Shimizu, Adachi, Nakagawa et al., 1997; Shimizu, Obayashi et al., 2000; Shimizu, Park et al., 2000) and Ê these residues are still not clearly de®ned in the 1.00 A structure. An interesting feature of atomic resolution structures is the ability to deduce the position of H atoms. A difference omit map, in which all H atoms are removed, was computed using Ê re®ned phases at 1.00 A. To avoid model bias resulting from over-re®nement, three CGLS cycles were performed. As shown in Fig. 2, Fo À Fc peaks at the 2' level corresponding to the H atoms of a histidine residue and of a methylene group of haem propionate were observed. The ®nal models contain 2385 protein non-H atoms, 3361 and 3379 H atoms and 1045 and 892 water molecules in the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states, respectively. The coordinate errors of the ®nal models were determined as the estimated standard deviations (e.s.d.s) by inversion of the full-matrix least-squares matrix after removal of all Ê restraints. The mean e.s.d.s for all atoms are 0.028 and 0.030 A for ferric resting and ferrous CO states, respectively. The e.s.d.s averaged over main-chain atoms of each residue are plotted as a function of the residue numbers for the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states (Fig. 3). The e.s.d.s in both Ê structures are as low as 0.02 A, except for several sites in BH helix and loop regions. Since these residues are located at the most ¯exible parts of the structure, they have high B factors and weak electron densities. As expected, e.s.d.s strongly correlate with the corresponding B factors.
3.2. Haem orientation and geometry

orientation of the haem in the crystal structure has never been observed in normal haem proteins or enzymes such as myoglobin (Mb), haemoglobin (Hb) or other P450s; only one case has been reported in the haem-bound haemophore (haem transporter) HasA (Arnoux et al., 2000). However, the ¯ipped orientation of the haem has been frequently reported in solution structures of haem proteins by CD (Aojula et al., 1986) and NMR studies (La Mar et al., 1983), indicating that the two interconverting protein forms are present at equilibrium. Thus, it is most probable that the two orientations are nearly equally stable in P450nor, so that both forms are crystallized in a single crystal. The occupancies of the reversed orientation of the haem (the minor form) re®ne to 38.3 and 39.1% for the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states, respectively. Functional differences between the two forms possessing the different haem orientation have been examined in some haem proteins; sperm whale myoglobin exhibits identical O2and CO-binding properties (Light et al., 1987), while monomeric insect Hb displays a difference in the Bohr effect (Gersonde et al., 1986) and cytochrome b5 shows a difference of $30 mV in the redox potential (Walker et al., 1988). In the case of P450nor, the functional properties measured so far (binding rates of CO and NO, redox potential and catalytic rate constants of NO reduction) are monophasic and functional differences between the two forms with different haem orientations are apparently negligible.

The 2Fo À Fc electron-density map (1.5') and the Fo À Fc map (3') of the haem in the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states are superimposed on the model structure in Fig. 4. If we assume one orientation of the haem (the major form), Fo À Fc peaks are clearly observed at the 1- and 3-methyl positions. These peaks show the existence of another orientation of the haem (the minor form) in the crystal, which is rotated by a 180 rotation around the ,-meso axis. This type of double

functionally important, as the NO molecule must bind the haem very rapidly to achieve the extraordinary high turnover rate of the enzyme (Shiro et al., 1995). Electron density corresponding to a glycerol molecule (contained in the solution of protein preparation) was observed on the surface at the proximal side. The electron densities of C and O atoms in glycerol can be distinguished based on the volume of the density contoured at 1.5'. These electron densities were assigned as water molecules in the Ê previous 1.7 A structures at cryotemperature (Shimizu, Obayashi et al., 2000). The glycerol molecule is fully occupied and has a low temperature factor. The glycerol molecule interacts with the side chains of the proximal residues (Asp90, His350 and Arg292).

3.4. Structural validation and conformational properties of the AR structures

The atomic resolution structures of the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states were validated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) (Table 2). The Ramachandran plot shows a higher percentage (ferric resting state, 92.6%; ferrous CO state, 92.8%) of residues in the most favoured regions than that of Ê 1.7 A structure (90.5%); no residues were found in the disallowed or generously allowed regions. Analysis of the stereochemistry of the atomic resolution structure shows that

all geometric parameters are within the limits expected for this resolution. The mean deviation from the ideal geometry of the atomic resolution structure is larger than that present in the Ê ®nal re®nement statistics of the 1.7 A structure because of the looser restraints on the stereochemistry. The statistics of the bond distances and bond angles for the polypeptide backbone and C atoms are given in Table 2. The majority of the various types of bond distances and bond angles follow the normal distribution. However, for 3 and 1 angles statistically signi®cant discrepancies from original parameters have been found. Such discrepancies from the ideal geometries have been systematically validated using several atomic resolution structures and validation tools (EU 3-D Validation Network, 1998). The 3 torsion angles have a mean value of 179.8 with a standard deviation of 5.8 (Fig. 7a). 3 varies from 193.9 (Thr104) to 166.6 (Met89), showing that the peptide bond is not quite planar and has a slightly asymmetric distribution. The electron density of these regions also con®rms the validity of the non-planar conformation. The distribution seems to re¯ect a general property of proteins. The values of the 11 (NÐCÐCÐX , where X corresponds to C, S or O atoms depending on the residue type) and 12 (CÐCÐX ÐX) torsion angles show similar distributions to those expected on the basis of simple energy calculations; certain combinations of 11 and 12 are preferred (Ponder & Richards, 1987). Overall analysis showed the torsion angles are tightly clustered about three possible rotameric states (gaucheÀ, gauche+ and trans) (Fig. 7b). Omitting proline, the mean values and standard deviations of the atomic resolution structures are 64.1 (9.6), 181.2 (9.8), À66.1 (9.0 ) when residues with multiple conformations are included and 64.0 (9.9), 180.5 (9.9), À65.8 (8.8 ) when they are excluded. This is a narrower distribution than found in the Ê 1.7 A structure [59.2 (13.0), 180.0 (11.7), À68.6 (13.8 )]

residues are identical in both the ferric and ferrous states, except for Pro9 which forms double-puckered conformations in the ferric state (Fig. 8).

4. Concluding remarks
Cytochrome P450nor has been re®ned anisotropically to a resolution of 1.00 and Ê 1.05 A in the ferric and the ferrous carbonmonoxy states, respectively. The re®nement led to signi®cant improvement in the accuracy of the model compared with Ê the best structure to date (1.7 A). P450nor consists of 403 amino-acid residues (46 kDa) and is one of the largest proteins re®ned to atomic resolution thus far. Owing to the improvement in resolution, unique features are found in the re®ned structures. Firstly, two orientations of the haem are signi®cantly populated in both ferric resting and ferrous CO states. The occupancies of the minor form are re®ned to 38.3 and 39.1% for the ferric resting and the ferrous CO states, respectively. So far, there is no indication that the two forms are biologically different. Secondly, a disordered water is found weakly bound to the haem iron in the ferric resting state. It is possible Figure 8 the protein must weaken the binding of Stereoview of the 2Fo À Fc map around Pro9 is contoured at 1.5': (a) ferrous CO state, (b) water to the ferric haem in order to ferric resting state. promote rapid NO binding.
