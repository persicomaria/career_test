Peptidoglycan (PGN) is the major component of bacterial cell walls and one of the main microbial products recognized by the innate immune system. PGN recognition is mediated by several families of pattern recognition molecules, including Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins, and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). However, only the interaction of PGN with PGRPs, which are highly conserved from insects to mammals, has so far been characterized at the molecular level. Here, we describe recent structural studies of PGRPs that reveal the basis for PGN recognition and provide insights into the signal transduction and antibacterial activities of these innate immune proteins. Peptidoglycan as a target for innate immune recognition The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading microorganisms in vertebrates and the only line of defense in invertebrates and plants [1,2]. It recognizes microbes by means of pattern recognition molecules, such as Toll-like receptors, collectins and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), which are conserved in evolution to bind unique products of microbial metabolism not produced by the host (pathogen-associated molecular patterns). Examples of microbial ligands recognized by pattern recognition molecules include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid of Gram-positive bacteria, flagellin, mannans, nonmethylated CpG sequences and peptidoglycan (PGN), which is present in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [1,2]. Cellular activation by pattern recognition molecules following ligand binding results in acute inflammatory responses involving direct local attack against the invading pathogen, cytokine and chemokine production, and induction of the adaptive component of the immune system (in the case of vertebrates). As a major constituent of the cell wall of virtually all bacteria, PGN represents an excellent target for innate immune recognition. PGNs are polymers of alternating Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) in a b(1!4) linkage, crosslinked by short peptide stems composed of alternating L- and D- amino acids [3,4] (Figure 1). Whereas the carbohydrate backbone is

conserved among all bacteria (except for de-N-acetylated or O-acetylated variants), the peptide moiety displays considerable diversity. According to the residue at position three of the peptide stems, PGNs are divided into two major categories: L-lysine type (Lys-type) and meso-diaminopimelic acid type (Dap-type). Dap-type PGN stems are usually directly crosslinked, whereas Lys-type PGN stems are interconnected by a peptide bridge that varies in length and amino acid composition in different bacteria (Figure 1). Moreover, bacteria differ widely in the extent of crosslinking, thus introducing additional diversity in PGN structure [3,4]. Several families of pattern recognition molecules have been shown to detect PGNs, including CD14 [5], which also binds to LPS, Toll-like receptor 2 (although this is controversial) [6,7], nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins (NODs) [8] and PGRPs, which are the subject of this review. To date, however, only the interaction of PGN with PGRPs has been characterized at the molecular level by X-ray crystallography. Indeed, except for collectins [9], which bind to mannans, no structural information is available on how any other pattern recognition molecules engage microbial ligands. Here, we present the general characteristics and biological functions of PGRPs (reviewed in greater detail elsewhere; see Ref. [10]). We describe recent structural studies of PGRPs that have revealed the basis for PGN recognition and discuss the results within the context of the role of PGRPs in immune defense. Distribution and characteristics of PGRPs PGRPs are found in most animals, including insects, echinoderms, molluscs and vertebrates, but not in lower metazoa (nematodes) or plants [10]. These highly conserved innate immunity molecules were first discovered in silkworm (Bombyx mori) as 20-kDa proteins with the ability to trigger the prophenoloxidase (PPO) cascade upon binding to PGN [11]. Subsequently, PGRPs were identified in other insects such as Drosophila and moths (Trichoplusia ni), and in mice and humans [12]. The PGRP family currently includes nearly 100 members [10], all of which have a homologous PGN-binding domain of 165 amino acids in length. This domain shares 30% sequence similarity with bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, a Zn2+-dependent amidase that hydrolyzes PGN [13]. Like T7 lysozyme, some PGRPs (referred to as catalytic PGRPs) hydrolyze PGN by

Figure 1. Structure of PGNs. (a) Schematic representation of Lys-type PGNs. In Staphylococcus aureus, Lys-type PGN peptides are crosslinked through a peptide bridge composed of one to five glycines. However, this bridge varies in length and amino acid composition in different bacteria [3,4]. The number of amino acids (n) can range from zero to five, depending on the organism.

cleaving the amide bond between MurNAc and L-Ala [14­17]. Non-catalytic PGRPs, which comprise the large majority of this protein family, bind to PGN but do not have amidase activity owing to the lack of a key cysteine residue for Zn2+ binding [12,15,18]. With respect to PGN recognition, both catalytic and non-catalytic PGRPs show distinct specificities for PGNs from Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Insect PGRPs are grouped into two classes: short PGRPs (PGRP-S), which are small (20 kDa) extracellular proteins, and long PGRPs (PGRP-L) of up to 90 kDa, which can be intracellular, extracellular or transmembrane. Drosophila melanogaster has 13 PGRP genes that are transcribed into at least 17 proteins [19] and a species of mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) has seven PGRP genes that are transcribed into at least nine proteins [20]. Many of the insect PGRPs are expressed in immune competent organs, such as the fat body, gut and hemocytes [2]. In most cases, PGRP expression is up-regulated by exposure to PGN or bacteria, suggesting an important role in antimicrobial defense (see later). Indeed, all functions of insect PGRPs identified so far involve innate immune responses. Phylogenetic analysis of insect PGRPs has suggested a possible early separation into catalytic PGRPs, which hydrolyze PGN, and non-catalytic PGRPs, which activate proteolytic cascades or signaling pathways [10]. Mammals have four PGRPs, termed PGRP-S, PGRP-L, and PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib (for short, long and intermediate, respectively). (Recently, the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee changed their names to PGLYRP-1, PGLYRP-2, PGLYRP-3, and PGLYRP-4, respectively; however, to avoid confusion, we retain the

original nomenclature here.) Of these, only PGRP-L has amidase activity [14,17]. PGRP-L also contains a large Nterminal domain of unknown function. By contrast to insect PGRPs, some of which are transmembrane receptors, all mammalian PGRPs are soluble intracellular or secreted molecules. Thus, PGRP-S is found in phagocytic granules [21­24], PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib are present on skin and mucous membranes [25,26] and PGRP-L is constitutively produced by the liver [27]. Some mammals such as pigs express multiple splice variants of PGRP-L that might have distinct roles [28]. Functions of PGRPs in innate immunity Insect PGRPs are involved in important signaling pathways in innate immunity. Two Drosophila PGRPs, PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD, recognize bacterial PGN and activate the Toll receptor [29,30]. PGRP-SA is required for triggering the Toll pathway whereas PGRP-SD is not essential but enhances signaling. Activation of Toll initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in the expression of drosomycin and other antimicrobial peptides, which are primarily active against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi [2]. Toll is mainly triggered by Lys-type PGN from Grampositive bacteria and only weakly triggered by Dap-type PGN from Gram-negative bacteria [31]. The Drosophila Imd pathway, which regulates expression of diptericin and other antimicrobial peptides active against Gram-negative bacteria, is triggered by the binding of Dap-type PGN to PGRP-LC in cooperation with PGRP-LE [32­34]. PGRP-LC is a transmembrane receptor with three alternative splice isoforms (PGRP-LCa, -LCx and -LCy) that have somewhat different specificities,

whereas PGRP-LE exists as either a soluble intracellular or extracellular protein [34]. PGN binding to PGRP-LC induces formation of PGRP-LCa­PGRP-LCx heterodimers on the cell surface, which in turn induces downstream signaling [35­37]. Unlike non-catalytic PGRPs, catalytic PGRPs are thought to function as scavengers that are implicated in terminating the immune response to PGN [16]. In this regard, the Drosophila amidases PGRP-LB, PGRP-SC1 and PGRP-SC2 negatively regulate the Imd pathway to adjust immune activation to infection by Gramnegative bacteria [38,39]. A third pathway in insects triggered by PGRPs is the PPO cascade, a proteolytic cascade in the hemolymph that leads to localized wound healing and melanization [40,41]. Several PGRPs, including PGRP-S from both B. mori [11] and mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) [42], and PGRP-LE from Drosophila [43], activate the PPO pathway following PGN recognition. In addition, PGRP-1 from a beetle (Holotrichia diomphalia) triggers this pathway by sensing 1,3-b-Dglucan, which is a component of fungal cell walls [44]. Mammalian PGRPs are selectively expressed in a variety of tissues including bone marrow (PGRP-S), skin and intestinal tract (PGRP-Ia and -Ib), and liver (PGRP-L) [12,25,26,45]. Initially, mammalian PGRPs were thought to activate signaling pathways in ways analogous to insect PGRPs [46]; however, more recent data have demonstrated that the mammalian proteins are bactericidal (PGRP-S, Ia and -Ib) or function as scavengers (PGRP-L) [14,17,21­ 25]. The bactericidal activity of PGRP-S requires Ca2+, without which it is only bacteriostatic [21,23,24]. Human PGRP-S, which is present in polymorphonuclear leukocyte granules, participates in the intracellular killing of bacteria [21] and is an effector of neutrophil-mediated innate immunity [24]. In addition, mice deficient in PGRP-S exhibit increased susceptibility to intraperitoneal infections with Gram-positive bacteria [23]. Human PGRP-Ia and -Ib are secreted as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers and are directly bactericidal against pathogenic and nonpathogenic Gram-positive bacteria but not against normal flora bacteria [25]. They are also bacteriostatic for Gram-negative bacteria and for normal flora Gram-positive bacteria. In sharp contrast to antimicrobial peptides such as defensins, which permeabilize bacterial membranes, PGRP-Ia and -Ib kill bacteria by interacting with the cell wall where they presumably inhibit PGN biosynthesis [25]. If so, this mechanism would resemble those of peptide antibiotics such as vancomycin and actagardine, which interfere with PGN synthesis by binding to PGN or its precursors. PGRP-L, a catalytic PGRP produced in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream [27], might prevent excessive inflammation or attenuate immune responses to bacteria by hydrolyzing PGN. It is also possible that PGRP-L, by hydrolyzing PGNs, can generate ligands for other innate immunity proteins, such as NOD1. Structure of PGRPs Each PGRP contains a single PGN-binding domain (C-terminal in the case of long PGRPs), except for mammalian PGRP-Ia and -Ib and Drosophila PGRP-LF in which there are two tandem PGN-binding domains [18]. It was predicted that PGRPs would have a similar fold to

T7 lysozyme and this was first confirmed by the crystal structure of Drosophila PGRP-LB [15]. Subsequently, the PGN-binding domain structures of six additional PGRPs were determined: PGRP-Ia C-terminal PGN-binding domain (designated PGRP-IaC) [18,47,48] and PGRP-S from humans [49] and PGRP-SA [50,51], PGRP-LCa [52], PGRP-LE [53] and PGRP-LCx [54] from Drosophila. All of these structures exhibit a similar overall scaffold that contains a central b-sheet composed of five b-strands [four parallel and one (b5) antiparallel] and three a-helices (Figure 2a). The structures are cross-linked by 1­3 disulfide bonds, which probably serve to stabilize PGRPs in the harsh environment of the extracellular compartment or phagocytic granules. One of these disulfides (corresponding to Cys214­Cys220 in PGRP-IaC) is conserved in all PGRPs except Drosophila PGRP-LE. The Cys194­ Cys238 disulfide in PGRP-IaC is unique to mammalian PGRPs, in which it is retained in all noncatalytic PGRPs but is absent from PGRPs with known PGN-hydrolyzing activity. All PGRPs share a conserved L-shaped PGNbinding groove (Figure 2b) with one deep and one shallow end [47]. In addition, all PGN-binding domains contain an N-terminal segment of 30­50 residues, characterized by high sequence and conformational variability, which is absent from T7 lysozyme and, hence, is known as the PGRP-specific segment (Figure 2c). This segment, with helix a2, forms a broad hydrophobic groove on the face opposite the PGN-binding site of each protein (Figure 2d). The possibility exists that this topologically variable surface might serve as a docking site for different effector or signaling proteins [15,18,49] that are still largely undefined. In this regard, Drosophila PGRP-SA has been shown to associate with Gram-negative binding protein 1 (GNBP1) in activating the Toll receptor pathway [55­57]. This interaction might be mediated by the PGRP-specific segment of PGRP-SA. The catalytic PGRPs include Drosophila PGRP-LB [15] and PGRP-SC1b [16] and the vertebrate PGRP-L [14,17]. In the Drosophila PGRP-LB structure [15], a zinc ion is found in the PGN-binding groove, coordinated by three residues (His42, His152, Cys160) that are strictly conserved in all catalytic PGRPs (Figure 2e). A general mechanism for PGN hydrolysis by PGRPs has been proposed, in which the bound Zn2+ functions as an electrophilic catalyst to facilitate cleavage of the amide bond between MurNAc and L-Ala. [47]. Although most non-catalytic PGRPs retain residues corresponding to His42 and His152 of PGRP-LB, they invariably lack the zinc-coordinating residue Cys160 (Figure 2f), which has been shown by mutagenesis to be necessary for PGN hydrolysis. As a consequence, noncatalytic PGRPs, which include most PGRPs, do not contain Zn2+ and bind to PGNs but do not hydrolyze them. Interaction of PGRPs with PGN Understanding the molecular basis for PGN recognition by PGRPs requires direct information on PGRP­PGN interactions in the binding site. Accordingly, several crystal structures have recently been determined of non-catalytic PGRPs in complex with small PGN fragments, either synthetic or naturally occurring [47,48,53,54]. The use of

such fragments is necessitated by the polymeric structure of PGN, which renders this large, heterogeneous molecule unsuitable for crystallization with PGRPs in its native form. The first reported PGRP­PGN structure was that of a complex between human PGRP-IaC and MurNAc-L-AlaD-isoGln-L-Lys, a synthetic muramyl tripeptide (MTP) representing the conserved core of Lys-type PGNs from Gram-positive bacteria [47]. Subsequently, the crystal structure of PGRP-IaC in complex with a muramyl pentapeptide (MPP) containing a complete peptide stem (MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGln-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) was determined, providing a more comprehensive picture of PGRP­PGN

interactions [48]. In this complex (Figure 3a), the peptide stem of the ligand is buried at the deep end of the PGNbinding groove and the N-acetylmuramic acid is situated in the middle of the groove with its pyranose ring oriented perpendicularly to the base of the pocket. In the PGRP-IaC­MPP complex (Figure 3a), the ligand is 60% buried in the PGN-binding site with its glycan and peptide portions buried to similar extents. Comparison of the PGRP-IaC­MPP and PGRP-IaC­MTP structures revealed several conformational differences that contribute to MPP recognition, including large side-chain rotations that lock the peptide stem of MPP into the

binding groove [48]. MPP makes extensive interactions with 20 PGRP residues, including numerous van der Waals contacts and both direct and solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds (Figure 3b). Most of these interactions are with the peptide, rather than glycan, portion of the PGN analog; however, both sets of contacts are essential for specific ligand recognition. In addition, the majority of hydrogen bonds to the pentapeptide stem of MPP involve mainchain, rather than side-chain, atoms of the peptide. Although none of the PGN-contacting residues in the complex is completely invariant among the almost 100 PRGP sequences reported to date, five of them (His208, His231, Tyr242, His264, Asn269) are >80% identical. These residues form a nearly contiguous patch on the floor of the binding groove (Figure 2b), strongly suggesting that all PGRPs employ this same basic PGN-binding mode. This conclusion is supported by the crystal structure of a heterodimeric receptor formed by Drosophila PGRP-LCa and -LCx in complex with tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), a naturally occurring monomeric fragment of Dap-type PGN containing an anhydro form of MurNAc [54]. This structure also provides important new insights into PGRPs as both recognition and signaling molecules. TCT [GlcNAcMurNAc(1,6-anhydro)-L-Ala-g-D-Glu-meso-Dap-D-Ala] is a

potent activator of the Drosophila Imd pathway [35] and a principal contributor to tissue damage in whooping cough and gonorrhea [58,59], although the mammalian receptor for TCT is unknown. Recognition of TCT in Drosophila requires both PGRP-LCa and -LCx [35,37], which are type II transmembrane proteins that have identical cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains but different PGRP domains in their extracellular regions. TCT binds directly to the ectodomain of PGRP-LCx, but not to PGRP-LCa, whose PGN-binding groove is partially occluded by amino acid insertions [52]. Upon binding PRGP-LCx, TCT induces heterodimerization of PGRP-LCx and -LCa, resulting in juxtaposition of their cytoplasmic domains and receptor activation [35­37]. In the PGRP-LCa­PGRP-LCx­TCT ternary complex (Figure 3c), PGRP-LCx (which has a typical PGN-binding cleft) engages TCT in a similar manner to the binding of MPP by PGRP-IaC (Figure 3a). The exposed GlcNAc-MurNAc(1,6-anhydro) moiety of bound TCT and adjacent elements of PGRP-LCx together form the recognition surface for PGRP-LCa, which contacts TCT and PGRP-LCx using a site that is spatially separate from its atypical PGN-binding groove. Thus, TCT forms an integral part of the interface between the two proteins, stabilizing the ternary complex.

Drosophila PGRP-LE is a soluble protein that lacks a transmembrane domain or signal sequence and is an intracellular receptor for TCT [34]. In the complex between TCT and PGRP-LE (Figure 3d), TCT is bound by two PGRP-LE molecules in a manner closely resembling that observed in the PGRP-LCa­PGRP-LCx­TCT complex [53]. Thus, one PGRP-LE interacts with TCT at the PGN-binding groove as described for PGRP-LCx. At the same time, a second PGRP-LE interacts with the disaccharide unit of the ligand through a site equivalent to the one employed by PGRP-LCa. Importantly, dimerization of PGRG-LE increases its binding affinity (KD) for TCT by 30-fold to 30 nM [53]. In addition, TCT was shown to induce multimerization of PGRP-LE in solution. Human PRGP-Ia and -Ib each contain two PGN-binding domains and are secreted as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers [25]. Two possibilities can be considered for the functional role of tandem domains. First, incorporation of multiple PGN-binding domains within a single PGRP might serve to augment avidity by permitting multivalent attachment to the bacterial cell wall. Second, tandem domains might confer multiple PGN-binding specificities to individual PGRPs, thereby expanding the ability of a relatively small number of proteins to detect a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens. Specificity of PGRPs: discrimination between Dap- and Lys-type PGNs Some PGRPs specifically or preferentially recognize Dap-type or Lys-type PGNs. For example, the Drosophila Imd pathway is activated by Dap-type PGN from Gramnegative bacteria through PGRP-LC or -LE, whereas the Toll pathway is activated by Lys-type PGN from Grampositive bacteria through PGRP-SA or -SD [2,29­35]. Similarly, human PGRP-IaC exhibits a strict requirement for L-Lys at position three of the peptide stem, whereas PGRP-S preferentially binds Dap-type PGN [60]. Crystallographic studies of PGRP­PGN complexes combined with

site-directed mutagenesis have revealed the molecular basis for this discrimination, which seems to be vital for the biological function of PGRPs. In the PGRP-IaC­MPP structure, Asn236 and Phe237 interact with the side chain of L-Lys by forming several van der Waals contacts (Figure 4a) [47,48], suggesting that sequence variability at these two positions might explain specificity differences. Consistent with this hypothesis, sequence alignments showed that, like PGRP-IaC, PGRPs that are known to recognize Lys-type but not Dap-type PGN (e.g. Drosophila PGRP-SA) contain Asn-Phe at positions 236 and 237 (or homologous combinations such as Asp-Phe or Asn-Tyr) [60]. By comparison, the corresponding residues are Gly-Trp in PGRPs that preferentially recognize Dap-type PGN (e.g. Drosophila PGRP-LCx, LB and -LE, human PGRP-S). Mutation of residues AsnPhe to Gly-Trp (or vice versa) in several PGRPs resulted in the expected changes in PGN-binding specificity, as measured by microcalorimetry, thereby pinpointing the site of PGRPs that mediates discrimination [60]. The crystal structures of PGRPs provide an explanation for the effects of these mutations. Thus, in the PGRP-IaC­ MPP complex (Figure 4a), the side chain of Asn236 protrudes from the wall of the binding groove, contacting the LLys side chain. Attachment of a carboxylate group to this side chain, which distinguishes Dap from L-Lys, would create steric clashes with Asn236, decreasing affinity. The corresponding Gly of PGRPs that prefer Dap would not interfere with binding because Gly lacks a side chain. This analysis provides a basis for predicting the PGNbinding specificity of PGRPs that have not been characterized experimentally [60]. Further insights into the basis for differential PGN recognition come from the structures of Drosophila PGRP-LE and -LCx bound to TCT [53,54], which has Dap in its peptide stem [58]. In both complexes, the side-chain carboxylate of Dap forms a bidentate salt bridge with the guanidinium group of a conserved Arg (residue

254 in PGRP-LE) (Figure 4b). Notably, nearly all PGRPs containing the Gly-Trp motif described earlier also contain a corresponding Arg, indicating that these amino acids function in concert to stabilize the interaction with Daptype PGN. In addition to distinguishing between PGNs based on L-Lys or Dap in the peptide stem, PGRPs can also detect the peptide bridge crosslinking the stems [60]. Thus, PGRPs have evolved dual strategies for PGN discrimination. The length and composition of the connecting bridge vary in different bacteria, and bacteria differ widely in the extent of crosslinking (5­75%) [3,4]. In experiments with synthetic PGN fragments, some PGRPs (e.g. human PGRP-IaC) bind equally well to crosslinked and non-crosslinked PGN, whereas others (e.g. human PGRP-S, Drosophila PGRP-LC) recognize only non-crosslinked PGN [60]. Importantly, the identity of the amino acid at position three of the stem, coupled with differences in the type and amount of crosslinking between stems, accounts for nearly all the structural variability in PGNs from different bacteria. The biological relevance of the finding that certain PGRPs sense PGN crosslinking is supported by data showing that lightly crosslinked (25%) PGN is capable of triggering the Drosophila Imd pathway through PGRP-LC, whereas heavily crosslinked (75%) PGN is inactive [61]. Concluding remarks and future perspectives Remarkable progress has been made during the past several years towards understanding the role of PGRPs in host defense, and its structural underpinnings. These studies have revealed that all PGRPs probably bind to PGN in a similar manner but insect and mammalian PGRPs differ markedly in how they accomplish antimicrobial defense: whereas insect PGRPs activate signal transduction pathways, mammalian PGRPs are directly bactericidal. However, substantial challenges remain. These include the identification and structural characterization of molecules such as GNBP1 that link insect PGRPs to signaling pathways, and the functions of PGRPs in other invertebrates and in non-mammalian vertebrates. Some PGRPs (e.g. mammalian PGRP-L and Drosophila PGRP-LE) contain large Nterminal domains with no homology to other known proteins, whose structures and functions remain to be established. Mammalian PGRPs are less well understood than their insect counterparts, particularly regarding their role in vivo. Moreover, although mammalian PGRPs have been shown to be bactericidal, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this regard, Drosophila PGRP-SB1 was also found to be bactericidal, with activity dependent on PGN hydrolysis by this catalytic PGRP [62]. By contrast, mammalian PGRPs kill bacteria in the absence of enzymatic activity [25] and must therefore employ a different mechanism. To date, structural studies of PGN recognition by PGRPs have been restricted to complexes between PGRPs and monomeric PGN fragments. However, because cell wall PGN is polymeric, the existing crystal structures might not fully capture the interaction of PGRPs with PGN. Advances in the synthesis of discrete multimeric PGN fragments [60,63], including ones with crosslinked peptide stems, might open the way to crystallographic analysis of higher order PGRP­PGN complexes that could exhibit cooperative

binding interactions. Finally, the recent discovery of mouse and human C-type lectins that, like PGRPs, bind to PGN and are directly bactericidal [64] suggests that these structurally unrelated pattern recognition molecules (and possibly others as well) mediate innate antimicrobial defense in mammals through functionally related mechanisms.
