The crystal structure of anthranilate synthase (AS) from Serratia marcescens, a mesophilic bacterium, has been solved in the presence of its substrates, chorismate and glutamine, and one product, glutamate, at 1.95 Å, and with its bound feedback inhibitor, tryptophan, at 2.4 Å. In comparison with the AS structure from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus, the S. marcescens structure shows similar subunit structures but a markedly different oligomeric organization. One crystal form of the S. marcescens enzyme displays a bound pyruvate as well as a putative anthranilate (the nitrogen group is ambiguous) in the TrpE subunit. It also confirms the presence of a covalently bound glutamyl thioester intermediate in the TrpG subunit. The tryptophan-bound form reveals that the inhibitor binds at a site distinct from that of the substrate, chorismate. Bound tryptophan appears to prevent chorismate binding by a demonstrable conformational effect, and the structure reveals how occupancy of only one of the two feedback inhibition sites can immobilize the catalytic activity of both TrpE subunits. The presence of effectors in the structure provides a view of the locations of some of the amino acid residues in the active sites. Our findings are discussed in terms of the previously described AS structure of S. solfataricus, mutational data obtained from enteric bacteria, and the enzyme's mechanism of action.

The Sequences of the Subunits of S. marcescens AS. S. marcescens trpE was subcloned from plasmid pGM6 (11) and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing (GenBank accession no. AY027546). The sequence of trpG was published by Tso et al.(12). Enzyme Isolation. A 4.5-kb EcoRI HindIII fragment containing S. marcescens trpEGDC was subcloned from pGM6 into a derivative of the expression plasmid ptacterm (13) and named pttSmEDC-3, with expression of trpEGDC now under the control of the isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible tac promoter. pttSmEDC-3 was transformed into strain W3110 metB trpR trpED24 containing pMS421, a plasmid with the lacIq gene. Cultures were grown in 1 minimal medium (14) containing 0.05% acid hydrolyzed casein, 0.2% glucose, 20 g ml L-tryptophan, 30 g ml L-methionine, 50 g ml spectinomycin, and 100 g ml ampicillin, and shaken at 37°C to

nthranilate synthase (AS) catalyzes the initial two reactions unique to tryptophan biosynthesis (Scheme 1) (1). The enzyme from Serratia marcescens consists of two polypeptide chains that form a complex TrpE2:TrpG2 (2). The TrpE subunit binds chorismate (CA) and is the site of formation of anthranilate from CA and NH3, either aqueous, or physiologically supplied from glutamine hydrolysis by TrpG. TrpG is a member of the glutamine amidotransferase ``triad'' family (3, 4). In S. marcescens, Trp, a competitive inhibitor of CA, abolishes both Scheme 1 reactions when bound to TrpE (2). The S. marcescens AS has been well characterized (3, 5­7). Known are the Mr of its subunits, the kinetic constants of its effectors, the extent of cooperativity, some parameters of the 2-amino-2-deoxy-isochorismate (ADIC) synthase and lyase reactions, and other properties. There have been two recent reports on the crystallization and structure determination of AS. One is preliminary from Salmonella typhimurium (8). The second is an analysis at 2.5 Å of AS without ligands from Sulfolobus solfataricus, an archeobacterium (9). This organism lives optimally at 90°C and pH 4.5 (10). Its TrpE displays a novel fold and has 421 residues; TrpG has 195 residues, whereas the TrpE and TrpG subunits of S. marcescens have 520 and 193 residues, respectively.

matically: analysis of the solvent content and detection of a strong nonorigin peak in the self-rotation function on the 180° section indicated there were two TrpG:TrpE heterodimers in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement was conducted by using data between 8.0 and 4.0 Å. The rotation function with a radius of integration of 25 Å produced one clear solution 3.0 standard deviations above other peaks in the list. A translation function performed with this solution produced a peak with a correlation coefficient of 12.3% and an R factor of 51.3%. The top peak in the self-rotation function was then used to orient the second molecule relative to the first. A translation search conducted with the second molecule, holding the first fixed, correctly positioned it. After rigid-body refinement of the individual subunits, the final R factor and correlation coefficients were 49.8 and 16%, respectively. Phases and figures of merit were calculated from a polyalanine model constructed from the search model and molecular averaging carried out with SIGMAA and DM within the CCP4 package (17, 19, 20). The resulting electron density map clearly showed density for many of the missing side chains and some additional loops. Noncrystallographic symmetry restrained refinement and map improvement were carried out with CNS and REFMAC WARP (21­23), with all data between 50.0 and 2.4 Å incorporating corrections for bulk solvent and an overall anisotropic B factor, followed by rounds of automatic and manual building by using WARP (23) and O (24). The refinement strategy was judged by the effects of various models on the free R-factor set (25) (5% of reflections excluded from the refinement). The final R factor and free R factor were 24.6 and 31.4%, respectively. In all, 10 residues were not included in the model because of the absence of electron density: residues 1 from TrpG and 1­3 and 43­48 in TrpE. Density was weak for a number of regions in the structure, and they were tentatively modeled. Crystals of the C-crystal were solved by molecular replacement with the same script by using the partially refined heterodimer of the T-cr ystal and AMORE (14). Again, a TrpG2:TrpE2 complex was present in the asymmetric unit. Two clear peaks were visible in the rotation function, which when translated and put on a common origin resulted in a correlation coefficient of 27.4% and an R factor of 47.4%, this after rigid-body refinement, by using data between 8.0 and 4.0 Å. Refinement and rebuilding were carried out on all data between 50 and 1.95 Å with CNS, WARP, and REFMAC (21­23) (incorporating WARP for map improvement and solvent addition and CNS for bulk solvent and overall anisotropic B-factor correction). Again, the refinement strategy was adjudicated by monitoring the free R factor. This resulted in a model with an R factor of 18.3% and free R factor of 24.0% (Table 1). The model has good geometry (Table 1), with only one catalytically important residue (TrpG Cys-85) in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Results and Discussion

TrpG. TrpG is an structure defined by the SCOP database (26) as a Class I glutamine amidotransferase domain. The catalytic residues Cys-85 His-170 and Glu-172 are in conformations identical to previously determined folds of this type (4, 27).

TrpE of S. marcescens has the novel fold first characterized by Knochel et al. in S. solfataricus (9) consisting of two subdomains, I ¨ and II. It has 125 residues in addition to the thermophile, mostly confined to the N-terminal 240 residues (Fig. 1b). Subdomain I is composed of residues 1­57, 178­308, and 468­520, with one extra -helix ( 3a:202­219) relative to S. solfataricus.

One cis-proline is present at position 430. asymmetric unit of the S. solfataricus structure, both crystal forms of S. marcescens AS contain one heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit. The TrpG:TrpE interface of both bacterial enzymes is the same. The S. marcescens TrpG:TrpE protomer interface occludes 3,100 Å2 of the solvent accessible area, as calculated by the Lee and Richards algorithm (29) in CNS (21). Importantly, the heterotetramer interface is completely different in the crystals of the two organisms. We find that the heterotetramer interface in both S. marcescens crystal forms is mediated by the TrpE subunits, whereas the S. solfataricus crystal was found to have a TrpG:TrpG interface. The 2-fold axis in the S. marcescens molecule forms a bridge structure connecting the active sites by using the TrpE -helices 6 and 7 (residues 342­360) and strand 16 (residues 382­389) (Figs. 1b, 2a, and 3d). The heterotetramer interface occludes a solvent accessible area of 2,400 Å2 on binding. The identical finding in both

T and C crystals suggests that this quaternary conformation is unlikely to be a crystallization artifact. The change from the TrpG:TrpG interface to TrpE:TrpE between bacteria is perplexing. Particularly, because there is strong conservation between the two species of many of the residues in the S. marcescens heterotetramer interface (Fig. 1b). Further, should the S. solfataricus AS form a quaternary conformation identical to that of S. marcescens, the resulting TrpE:TrpE interface would occlude an area of 3,400 Å2 in contrast to the 1,000 Å2 occluded in the thermophile crystal.

density in the active site shows a glutamyl thioester intermediate with a carbon­sulfur covalent bond (1.7 Å). This is similar to the intermediates described by Thoden et al. (30), with the notable exception that none of the catalytic residues of the S. marcescens AS have been altered by mutation. His-170 and Glu-172 adopt conformations identical to other members of the glutamine amidotransferase family (4, 30­33). A number of residues are in close contact with the glutamyl moiety (Fig. 3a).

A number of residues are within H-bonding electrostatic distance to the pyruvate (Fig. 3b). The pyruvate carboxyl group is coordinated via H bonds to an ordered water, to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-449, the N of Gly-483, and the N of Arg-469. The carboxyl moiety of benzoate is coordinated via two main chain H bonds with Gly-328 N and Gly-485 N. A Mg2 ion is coordinated by the carboxyl moiety of the benzoate and a charged pocket provided by Glu-498 and Glu-361, with which it directly coordinates, and two water molecules held in position by Glu-358 and Glu-495 (Fig. 3b). Thr-329 O and His-398 N are both within 2.6 Å of the benzoate ring strongly supporting their role in catalysis as proposed by mutational studies (5). The absence of an NH2 group on benzoate needed to create anthranilate is an enigma. The electron density in TrpG clearly shows at least in the majority of the unit cells that a nitrogen has been cleaved from the glutamine. It is possible that ADIC may never have been formed, with benzoate made directly from CA, or anthranilate may have been made in the crystal but with the nitrogen removed. Clearly, the fate of the amino group remains to be solved.
Mechanism of the Lyase Reaction, the Conversion of ADIC to Anthranilate (AA). Some of the details of the conversion of ADIC to AA

(Scheme 1) can now be surmised. The key was the finding (1) that TrpE His-398 was indispensable. The C-crystal shows His-398 to be in close proximity to C2 of the benzene ring. A standard secondorder elimination can be invoked to yield the double bond between C2 and C3 with His-398 as the base abstracting the C2 proton and pyruvate as the leaving group. There is no assisting acid residue near C3. However, pyruvate is a good leaving group, and any Lewis acid, Mg2 or H2O, should suffice. An E1 mechanism seems less likely because ADIC was trapped by the His-398 mutation with the pyruvate intact on the ring. The crystal offers no information on the removal of the hydroxyl group from CA. T-Crystal

A-weighted map produced by REFMAC (22). Tryptophan binds in a pocket distinct from the CA-binding site in the hydrophobic -sandwich formed between -sheets from subdomains I and II. The Trp residue H-bonds with Ser-40 O , Pro-291 N, and Met-293 N; all are implicated in feedback inhibition by mutational analysis (5) (Fig. 3c). A conformational change brought about by the binding of tryptophan to a site 18 Å from the CA-binding site is responsible for disabling the enzyme. In general, the overall structure of the C-crystal appears to be more ordered, the crystals diffracting to significantly higher resolution and possessing a significantly lower mean B factor (Table 1). The structures from the two crystal forms are very similar, 0.713 Å rms deviation on 181 aligned Cas in TrpG, and 1.02 Å rms deviation on 471 aligned Cas in TrpE. However, when the two structures are superposed, it is noted that a number of regions are displaced relative to one another. In the T-crystal, a motif formed by the secondary structure elements 15, 6, 7, 16, 17 (residues 327­363 and 387­403) is shifted at most 7.0 Å away from the CA-binding pocket relative to the C-crystal (Fig. 3d). Significantly, this movement removes Thr-329, His-398, and all of the glutamate residues responsible for Mg2 binding from the vicinity of the active site. The rearrangement seems to be in part because of an ordering of loop 42­49 (Fig. 2a), which shows no visible density in the T-crystal (or in the S. solfataricus structure), but which is perfectly ordered in the Ccrystal. When compared by superposition with the S. solfataricus AS, crystallized without ligands, the corresponding region is in an intermediate position between that of the T- or C-crystal form. This suggests that without any ligand, this motif may reside in this mean position. In the presence of CA, the correct active site is assembled by moving this region toward the active-site crevice; in the presence

of Trp, the motif is forced to move away. This seesaw effect explains the competitive interaction between tryptophan and CA (Fig. 3d); further, it offers a rational explanation for competitive inhibition by molecules with different structures. That the loops involved in the active site are also those situated at the heterotetramer interface also explains the observation that one tryptophan molecule can inhibit both TrpE subunits (34). Because of the molecular 2-fold axis, a movement in one subunit must concomitantly move that of the other subunit in the same direction (Fig. 3d). The presence of tryptophan also affects the TrpG subunit. Two -sheets, 103­109 and 130­140 ( 5 and 6), move in response to tryptophan binding, presumably communicated through -helix 344­376 ( 7) in TrpE. The sheets become largely disordered in the T-crystal and were tentatively modeled and appear to move in such a way as to disrupt the residues that are necessary for glutamine binding. This is consistent with the known lack of glutaminase activity by TrpG until CA binds (3).
Spraggon et al.

Summary AS from the mesophile S. marcescens and the hyperthermophile S. solfataricus share many structural features, including the ``triad'' glutamine amidotransferase fold of TrpG and the novel TrpE fold first described in the thermophile. The striking oligomeric difference between the enzymes is that the TrpG:TrpE protomers of S. marcescens associate through the TrpE subunits instead of the TrpG subunits as in the thermophile. We have no explanation for the lack of TrpE:TrpE interaction in the thermophile, given the strong amino acid homology of the enzymes, particularly in the interaction regions. The C-crystal reveals a -glutamyl thioester with Cys-85 and a 1.7 Å C­S bond. The other members of the catalytic triad His-170 and Glu-172 are positioned as expected. The CA-binding site has been structurally characterized. There is unambiguous density for an aromatic benzoic acid and for pyruvate clearly separated from the ring. That benzoate

occupies the CA-binding site is supported by the following evidence: the topological precision of the Mg2 chelate pocket, the elimination of the CA hydroxyl group, and the proximity of benzoate to all of the amino acids assigned to the catalytic site by mutation (5). Of these amino acids inferred to belong to the CA-binding site by mutation, His-398 has been characterized as a putative base for the extraction of the proton at C2 of the ring. What is ambiguous is the position and existence of the orthoamino group, which is not visible in the electron density map. The T-crystal offers a structural interpretation of the competition between tryptophan and CA through a moiety that can oscillate between two binding sites, depending on occupancy. Further, occupancy of only one of these two sites is sufficient to abolish all enzyme activity as a consequence of the 2-fold molecular axis.

ferences additional to those already empirically observed with other pairs. A more substantial contribution may arise from tailoring experiments designed to eliminate the S. marcescens loops and decrease the entropy of the denatured form (35).
Note Added in Proof. We have learned that an analysis of a crystal of anthranilate synthase from Salmonella typhimurium, corresponding to our T-crystal, has been published with parallel results (43). We thank Benjamin Boe and David Braun for excellent technical assistance, Mark Miller for advice, and Peter Schultz for continued encouragement. For help with data collection and processing, we thank the Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.
