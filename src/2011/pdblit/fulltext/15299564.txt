Abstract
The structure of protein Cle, a human light-chain dimer from the ,;AII subgroup, was determined using 2.6A data; the R value is 18.4%. The structure was solved, after a false start, by molecular replacement with the ;.II/V Mcg protein as a search structure. When the refinement did not proceed beyond an R value of 27 %, it was discovered that while the constant domains were in their correct positions in the unit cell, the incorrect variable domains were used for defining the molecule. The correct solution required a rotation of 180 around the local twofold axis that relates the two constant domains of the dimer. The correct variable domain positions overlap about 70% of the same volume as the incorrect ones of a symmetry-related molecule. The refinement distorted the geometries of the domains. Though the constant domains were in their correct positions, the r.m.s. (root-mean-square) deviation of the Co~ atom position was 1.2A when the two constant domains were compared. For the correct structure, this value is 0.5 A,. The q9 and ~p angles, the r.m.s, chiral value and the free R value, even when calculated a posteriori, were good indicators of the correctness of the structure. The quaternary structure of the Cle molecule is similar to that in Mcg (crystallized from ammonium sulfate); the elbow bend is 115. However, the arrangement of the variable domains differs from that observed in other variable domain dimers. The variable domains of Cle are 0.7 ,~, closer than in Mcg or variable dimer Rei. The hydrogen bonding at the interface of the two domains is novel. Residues Tyr36 from both monomers form a hydrogen bond that is part of a network with the Gin89 residues from both monomers. For the first time hydrogen bonds were observed between the main-chain peptide N and O atoms of the complementarity-determining region CDR2 and CDR3 segments of both monomers.

1. Introduction
Immunoglobulin light chains have an N-terminal variable (V) and C-terminal constant (C) domain of about 100 residues each. These two domains are

connected by a flexible 'switch' peptide that allows one domain to move relative to the other. Three segments of the V domains are hypervariable and form the complementarity-determining regions (CDR's). Based on amino-acid sequences, x and 2 light chains have been identified. The )~ light-chain dimers consist of two covalently linked light chains which are disulfide bonded at their penultimate residues. The angle between the local twofold axis of the V domain dimer and the local twofold axis of the C domain dimer defines the 'elbow' bend. The structures of 2I light-chain dimer Loc (Chang et al., 1985; Schiffer et al., 1989; Huang, Ainsworth, Stevens & Schiffer, 1996) and £II/V light-chain dimer Mcg (Schiffer, Girling, Ely & Edmundson, 1973; Ely, Herron, Harker & Edmundson, 1989) have been previously determined; they were crystallized from several solvents. The Bence-Jones protein from patient Cle was characterized serologically and by its aminoacid sequence as a 211I light chain with Mcg-Kern-Ozconstant region (Eulitz, Murphy, Weiss & Solomon, 1991). It was excreted as the covalent dimer, and Cle protein formed casts in the kidney tubules of the patient (Myatt et al., 1994). Light chains of the 2Ill subgroup represent about 43% of human )~ chains (Solomon & Weiss, 1995). Protein Cle is the first 2II1 light-chain dimer to be studied by X-ray crystallographic techniques. The light chain in Fab fragment HIL (pdb8fab.ent) also belongs to the 21II subgroup. The 21II proteins are of special interest because they differ from proteins of the other five 2-chain subgroups by having an unusually short first CDR region, as is found in the KI subgroup (Kabat, Wu, Perry, Gottesman & Foeller, 1991). Protein Cle also has a Gin at position 89, a residue well conserved in K subgroups I, III and IV, but only predominant in 2 subgroups III and VI (Kabat et al., 1991). Residue 89 occurs at the interface of the V domains; in KI light chains such as Rei (Epp, Lattman, Schiffer, Huber & Palm, 1975) and Wat (Huang et al., 1994) it participates in the dimer formation. Molecular-replacement methods play an important role in the systematic study of the structures of light chains, antibodies and numerous other proteins. Molecular replacement for multidomain proteins has been

However, because the molecule consists of several identical domains and the inherent properties of the Patterson function, molecular replacement can give a reasonable but incorrect solution, as we found during this structure determination. We report here the structure determination of protein Cle by molecular replacement and the structure is described. The association of the V domains is different than previously observed in other light-chain dimers: they are held together by ten hydrogen bonds, and the domains are close together so a hydrogen bond can be formed between the main-chain segments of CDR2 and CDR3.

that was crystallized from ammonium sulfate, Mcg(AS), (1DCL: Xu & Schiffer, 1988) as the search model. The V domain of Cle differs from Mcg in 45 residues, and the CDR1 of Cle is three residues shorter than that of Mcg. PC refinement of the highest 6000 grid points of the rotation function was carried out using 15-4.0A resolution data. PC refinement revealed a solution with a correlation coefficient 1.23 times larger than the second solution. Translation searches using the method of Fujinaga & Read (1987) as implemented in X-PLOR were carried out with the correctly oriented and PC-refined Mcg dimer. The maximum peak of the translation function was 7.7cr above the mean and 3.0or above the next-highest peak. The orientation and position of the starting model were subsequently refined by rigid-body refinement, starting with the refinement of the whole molecule, followed by refinement of the two V and the two C 2.

After the residues of Mcg were Protein Cle was obtained from the urine of a patient who had multiple myeloma. As reported previously replaced by the residues of Cle, one round of simulated(Stevens, Westholm, Panagiotopoulos, Solomon & annealing refinement using the slow-cooling method Schiffer, 1981), it was crystallized at p H 7 . 0 from (Brfinger, Krukowski & Erickson, 1990) reduced the R 1.8M ammonium sulfate in the orthorhombic space value to 0.30 for 10-2.65 A resolution data. After this point, the structure did not improve. The R value stayed group F2o12121 with a = 113.17, b = 72.54, c = 49.25A. The asymmetric unit consists of one at 0.27 even after several manual adjustments based on dimer; the volume fraction of protein in the crystal is (2F,, - F,,) maps and repeated refinements with X-PLOR and PROLSQ (Hendrickson, 1985) were carried out. 0.57. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room We noted that the geometries of the two variable temperature on a multiwire area detector at Monsanto domains deteriorated during the refinements and Company in St Louis. Two detectors were used hydrogen bonds connecting fl-sheets were broken. simultaneously, one collecting the reflections which lie Some close contacts were observed between the V2 between infinity and 3.2 A and the other an overlapping domain and the C2 domain in the molecular packing. At data set comprising reflections between 10.5 and the beginning, we thought that the problems were probably from an incorrect 'elbow bend' in the starting 2.65~,. The data were processed using a FourierBessel scaling method (Weissman, 1982), the scaling R model. In the light-chain dimers and Fab structures, the elbow bends can vary from 96 to 2 2 7 (Chang et al., value was 4.7%. A data set consisting of 55038 1985; Wilson & Stanfield, 1994). Since in a light-chain measurements was obtained, of which 11 373 reflections were unique.

The modified models were refined by rigid-body reflections. refinements with X-PLOR, but the R value did not improve. 2.2. Naming conventions used Finally, after examination of the structure, we came The naming of light-chain domains followed the to the conclusion that the two constant domains were in convention of Schiffer et al.

A few cycles of manual adjustment were made based on these density maps. Because of the resolution of the data and the relatively low n u m b e r of reflections in the data set, only the overall temperature factor was refined. The number of waters included in the refinement was 123, less than one water per three amino-acid residues. At the final stage of the refinement, the R value was 0.184 for 8684 reflections with Fo > 2a(Fo) between 10.0 and 2 . 6 5 , ~ resolution.

The final occupancies of the waters ranged from 0.50 to 1.0.

The correct dimer was generated by a rotation around the local twofold axis that relates the two C domains. (300 has been added to the residue members of chain 2). The positions of the C domains in both models are the same except for the interchange of the C 1 and C2 domains. The V dimer in the correct position superimposes on a V dimer of another asymmetric unit. The correct and incorrect V dimers overlap approximately 70% by volume.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Structure determination: molecular replacement
Comparisons of the course of refinement and the parameters from the restrained least-squares refinement for the correct and incorrect models are given in Tables 3 and 1, respectively. It can be seen from Table 2 that initially the refinement of the incorrect model appeared to proceed well. The R value of 27% and most of the refinement parameters for the incorrect model were acceptable. As shown in Table 1, the most notable difference of deviation in these two models is in their r.m.s, chiral volumes. It was 0.24,~, 3 in the incorrect model and 0 . 1 8 A 3 in the correct one. An r.m.s, chiral volume of 0.24,~3 still can be considered to be in the

acceptable range. The 99 and ~p angles were the only values that suggested that the structure might be incorrect. Only 49% of the residues of the wrong structure had the 99 and ~ angles in the most favoured region of the Ramachandran plots shown in Fig. 2, whereas 76% in the correct structure were in this region as given by PROCHECK (Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss & Thornton, 1993). The typical value for the percentage of residues in the most favoured regions is 74% for 2.65,~ structures. Free R value calculated a posteriori (Brfinger, 1996) shown in Table 3; it clearly differentiated between the correct and incorrect structures. The quarternary structures of the correct and incorrect models are comparable (Table 4). In both cases there is a local twofold axis between the two V domains and the two C domains, as expected. In the incorrect model, the local twofold relationship between the V domains is distorted: the rotational angle is 173 ~ instead of 179'. The difference between the two models shows up in the differences between the structures of the equivalent domains within the molecule, as reflected in the r.m.s, deviation of Ca atom coordinates when these domains are superimposed. To compensate for the incorrect positioning of the V domains, the refinement distorted the structure within the constraints given. The distortion was worse, 2.40 A compared with 0.77 A, for the V domains that were in incorrect positions. The Ca distribution was also distorted in the C domains, 1.24,~, compared with 0.51 ,~ for the correct structure, though the C domains were in approximately correct positions. The r.m.s, deviation found for the V and C domains in the correct Cle structure is similar to that observed in three different crystal forms of the Loc protein (Huang et al., 1996), determined with 2.3 ,~, resolution data. In another immunoglobulin structure, CD4, the r.m.s. deviation was 0 . 6 6 A between the D1 domains determined in two crystal forms (Ryu, Truneh, Sweet & Hendrickson, 1994). The two V domains in protein Rei (Epp et al., 1975) and in protein War (Huang et al., 1994) and in protein M29b (Essen & Skerra, 1994) that were determined with higher, approximately 2,~,, resolution data are more similar to each other, the

r.m.s, deviation is 0.35, 0.36 and 0.35 A, respectively. In general the cores of the domains with identical sequences became more similar with increased resolution of the diffraction data, and as the refinement progressed. The differences between equivalent domains can be observed in surface loops that have different crystal contacts. Based on our study, the structure of the Mcg protein, crystallized from distilled water (Ely et al., 1989) probably should be re-examined; the r.m.s, deviation of the superimposed Cot-atom positions is 1.77 and 1.97 A for the V and C domains, respectively, and the chiral volume is above 0.3 ~3.

related by non-crystallographic symmetry; most of the values were below 1 A and the values above 1.5 ,~, were clearly outliers. We did not use non-crystallographic symmetry restraints; their use might have alerted us to problems with our model earlier. Crystal packing was reasonable for both models (Fig. 3), though in the incorrect model a few bad contacts exist between the V2 domain and a symmetry-related C2 domain. The b cell dimension of 72.54 A of the Cle crystal is similar to that in other 2 light-chain dimers. This results from similar packing of adjacent constant domains along the y axis direction, as previously described (Schiffer et al., 1985), where the constant domains are related by crystallographic twofold screw axes. The partial refinement was possible because, in the wrong structure, the C domains were in their correct position and the V domains of another asymmetric unit partially (about 70%) overlapped with the correct solution. After finding the correct orientation tor the model, we checked the rotation function, it did not have the correct rotation peak. Previously, rotation searches were also carried out with the program MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988); as search structures Mcg (AS), three different structures of protein Loc and the constant domain dimer were used, but no clear solution was obtained. Finally a direct rotation search (Brfinger, 1992) with Mcg (AS) as the search structure, the structure used in the original search had the correct peak as its highest peak. 3.2.

sequencing as Phe, Gly, Gly, Gly, Thr and Lys, homologous to other 2III-type proteins. The remaining six residues could not be sequenced; these residues w e r e identified from the electron density in homology with other sequences (Kabat et al., 1991). These are: 93 Ser (most frequently found in that position), 94 Asn or Asp (hydrogen-bonding pattern suggests that the residue is Asn and not Asp since it forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl O atom of residue 92), 95 Ala, 95A Ser, 96 Val, and 97 Val (Val is the most frequent residue observed at positions 96 and 97). The tertiary structures of the individual variable and constant domains of protein Cle are very similar to those of other )~ light chains. The arrangement of the domains in the Cle molecule is similar to that in Mcg (from ammonium sulfate). The elbow bend in Cle is 115 °, compared with 113 ° in Mcg(AS). The relative positions of the C domains are like those observed in other ,~ light chains. Comparison of the relative positions of the V domains in the crystals of Cle, Mcg, and Rei is shown in Table 4. The V domains in all three proteins are related by local twofold axes. Though the Mcg is a complete light chain (Schiffer et al., 1973) and the Rei protein is a V domain dimer (Epp et al., 1975), the distance between the V domains is essentially the same (24.6 and 24.7,~, respectively), but the V domains of the Cle protein are 0.7 A closer to each other than they are in Mcg. The r.m.s deviations between equivalent Cot-atom positions within each molecule reflect the resolution of the data. The cross comparison between the V domains from the different proteins using the identical 80 Cot atoms shows that the domains have highly homologous structures (see Table 5). The buried

translation. [For the above comparisons, the method and residues designated by Colman et al. (1987) were used.] The hydrogen bonds between the variable domains are listed in Table 6. There are four hydrogen bonds with a distance less than 3.5.~ between the two Rei domains, eight between the Mcg domains, and ten between Cle domains. The hydrogen bonds formed between the Gin residues 38 from each domain are conserved in all three structures. This is indeed a conserved feature of light-chain dimers and Fab fragments. Mcg has an Ala residue at position 89, but both Rei and Cle have Gin at position 89. A square-like arrangement of hydrogen bonds with Tyr36, previously seen in the Rei structure (Epp et al., 1975), was expected in Cle (see Fig. 4a). Instead (as shown in Fig. 4b) in Cle the two Tyr residues come into hydrogenbonding distance, forming a strongly hydrogen-bonded network of residues. To achieve this hydrogen-bonding pattern, the two V domains in Cle had to move closer together and the relative orientation of the domains had to change. The relative positions of the domains in Cle also resulted in hydrogen bonds between the peptide N atoms of residue 56 (located in CDR2) and the peptide O atom of residue 95 (located in CDR3) of both monomers (see Fig. 5). This is the first time that a mainchain-to-main-chain hydrogen bond between CDR's has been observed in a light-chain dimer.

4. Conclusions The identity of residues that determine the arrangement of the Cle V domains, relative to the V domain arrangement in both Mcg and Rei, is not clear. Cle has some residues in common with both the Mcg and the Rei protein. It is a )=type protein like Mcg, but since it is in the 2III subgroup, it has a Gin residue at position 89. Clearly in domain-domain interaction, both packing forces and polar interactions have to be favorable; the observed structures must represent the lowest energy form of the system. Detailed comparative studies of the three structures will be required to understand the

Fig. 5. The arrangements of identical residues Tyr36 and Gln89 from both monomers in the Rei protein (a) and in the Cle protein (b). In Rei, these residues form a hydrogen-bonded square, where the two Tyr residues are more than 5 A apart, while in Cle the 'square' is distorted and the two Tyr residues are 3.1A apart. In the Cle protein the centers of mass of the two V domains are 0.8, h. closer than they are in Rei. In addition, a twist in the domains relative to Rei makes the above arrangement of hydrogen bonds possible.

Fig. 6. Stereo figure of the V domain dimer of Cle. Residues 36, 38, 89 which form hydrogen bonds between the V domains of protein Cle and also obey the local twofoldsymmetrybetween the domains are shown. The hydrogen bond between the CDR2 residue 56 carbonyl O atom and the other domain's CDR3 residue 95 amide N atom is observed for the first time in light-chaindimers. The two domains are in an orientation that allows the formation of these bonds. function of the residues that determine the structures of the V dimers in each protein. The structure determination of protein Cle shows that molecular replacement can give a reasonable but incorrect solution for this multisubunit protein. In a multidomain protein connected with long flexible hinges, especially when the domains are homologous and the fraction of the unit cell occupied by protein is high, molecular replacement can identify a structure with incorrect connectivity. The q9 and qJ angles and (to lesser extent) the chiral volume are good indicators of the correctness of the structure as well as the free R, even calculated a posteriori. For immunoglobulins, where it has been shown that the basic core domain structure is maintained, comparison of the arrangement of the Ca atoms of equivalent domains is also useful as an index of refinement.
