Maltosyltransferase (MTase) from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima represents a novel maltodextrin glycosyltransferase acting on starch and malto-oligosaccharides. It catalyzes the transfer of maltosyl units from a-1,4-linked glucans or malto-oligosaccharides to other a-1,4-linked glucans, malto-oligosaccharides or glucose. It belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 13, which represents a large group of (b/a)8 barrel proteins sharing a similar active site structure. The crystal structures of Ê MTase and its complex with maltose have been determined at 2.4 A and Ê 2.1 A resolution, respectively. MTase is a homodimer, each subunit of which consists of four domains, two of which are structurally homologous to those of other family 13 enzymes. The catalytic core domain has the (b/a)8 barrel fold with the active-site cleft formed at the C-terminal end of the barrel. Substrate binding experiments have led to the location of two distinct maltose-binding sites; one lies in the active-site cleft, covering subsites À2 and À1; the other is located in a pocket adjacent to the active-site cleft. The structure of MTase, together with the conservation of active-site residues among family 13 glycoside hydrolases, are consistent with a common double-displacement catalytic mechanism for this enzyme. Analysis of maltose binding in the active site reveals that the transfer of dextrinyl residues longer than a maltosyl unit is prevented by termination of the active-site cleft after the À2 subsite by the side-chain of Lys151 and the stretch of residues 314-317, providing an explanation for the strict transfer speci®city of MTase.

Introduction
Maltosyltransferase (MTase) from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima represents a novel maltodextrin glycosyltransferase acting on starch and malto-oligosaccharides. It is extremely thermostable, displaying maximum activity at 8590  C at pH 6.5.1 This enzyme has a unique transfer speci®city to maltosyl units, transferring them from a-1,4-linked glucans or malto-oligosaccharides to other a-1,4-linked glucans, malto-oligosacAbbreviations used: MTase, maltosyltransferase; CGTase, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase; CBD, cellulose-binding domain.

charides or glucose.1 Besides transglycosylation activity, MTase also has a weak hydrolytic activity. Preliminary analysis (W.L., unpublished data) suggests that MTase is localized in the cytoplasm. Based on its activity on a-glucan substrates and malto-oligosaccharides, MTase could be involved in the catabolism of starch breakdown products or in the metabolism of a glycogen-like storage polysaccharide. However, a different role, such as in the synthesis of the unusual T. maritima glycolipids which contain a rare a-1,4-diglucosyl structure,2 cannot be excluded. MTase consists of 637 amino acid residues and is a homodimer in solution.1,3 Analysis of its primary structure1 revealed low-level local similarity to the glycoside hydrolase family 13 (also known as the a-amylase family), the largest family of glycoside

120 hydrolases which covers about 30 different hydrolases, transferases and isomerases (reviewed by Janecek4 and Kuriki & Imanaka5). Unlike typical aamylases, MTase does not require calcium for activity.1 The enzymes of family 13 catalyze the hydrolysis or/and synthesis of glucosidic linkages of starch and related poly- and oligosaccharides, involving four types of reactions: hydrolysis of a1,4 or a-1,6-glucosidic linkages and transglycosylation to form a-1,4- or a-1,6-glucosidic linkages. Crystal structures have been reported for eight distinct family 13 enzymes: the a-amylases,6 ± 11 the oligo-1,6glucosidases,12 the maltotetraohydrolases,13 the isoamylases,14 the maltogenic amylases,15 the cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases (CGTases),16 ± 18 the amylomaltases19 and the glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolases.20 All the family members possess a catalytic (b/a)8-barrel domain which has in all cases either a long loop, or an entire domain (termed domain B) interrupting the fold of the barrel. Domain B is the least similar region of the enzymes from this family4,21 and has been shown to be involved in substrate recognition in many of the family members.6,11,13,17,22 The common reaction chemistry of the a-amylase family enzymes is based on a two-step acid catalysis mechanism that requires two critical carboxylates: one acting as a general acid/base (Glu) and the other as a nucleophile (Asp). Both hydrolysis and transglycosylation proceed via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between the anomeric carbon, C1 and a nucleophile.22 ± 24 Whilst previously there has been a debate over whether this nucleophilic substitution is an SN1 or an SN2 reaction,5 overwhelming evidence currently points to a double-displacement mechanism supported by recent X-ray crystallographic studies on the complex of CGTase with covalently bound intermediate.25 In the ®rst reaction step, a carboxylate group provides general acidcatalysed leaving group departure simultaneously with a nucleophilic attack of the anomeric center of the sugar by the second carboxylate to form a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. In the second step, the intermediate undergoes transglycosylation or hydrolysis with general base assistance to facilitate attack by an incoming group. Both steps occur via transition states with substantial oxocarbenium ion character.26 A proposed role of an invariant third acidic residue (Asp) is to stabilize a positively charged transition state by reducing the electronegativity of the 2-hydroxyl of the sugar.25 The conservation in sequence of each of these critical residues in MTase is consistent with a similar mechanism. Here, we report the crystal structures of MTase Ê Ê and its maltose complex solved at 2.4 A and 2.1 A resolution, respectively, which have led to the identi®cation of the active site and to an understanding of the aspects of the catalytic mechanism and the structural basis of substrate speci®city.

Results and Discussion
Overall fold The MTase subunit consists of a single polypeptide chain of 637 residues that folds into four domains (Figure 1). The N-terminal domain (domain N) is composed of residues 1-63. This is followed by domain A (residues 64-204 and 360572), the largest domain, which has a (b/a)8 topology. Domain B (residues 205-359) is inserted between the b-strand b6 and the a-helix a12 of the A domain. Finally, domain C contains residues 573-637 at the C terminus (the ®nal carboxy-terminal residue was not included in the model due to poorly de®ned electron density). Figure 1(b) represents the topology of the secondary structure elements of MTase which were deduced from the hydrogen bond geometry and the f-c values calculated with the program PROCHECK.27 Domain N is composed of two a-helices and a small three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet. It is located adjacent to the a5 and a6 helices of domain A, with extensive hydrophobic interactions forming the interface between the two domains. The connections between the strands of the (b/a)8 barrel generally comprise a single a-helix. However, helices a5 and a12 are kinked at Pro127 and Met386-Gly387, respectively, and the connection between strands b11 and b12 of the barrel comprises two helices, a15 and a16. Domain B forms a loop-rich structure containing several short a-helices. It is separated from domain A by a deep cleft accommodating the putative active site. Domain C is comprised of eight antiparallel b-strands, which form an open-sided ``jelly roll'' Greek key b-barrel. The contact surface between domains A and C is formed mainly by hydrophobic interactions. Comparison to other enzymes Structural comparisons show that the (b/a)8barrel domain A and domain C in MTase are very similar to the other members of the a-amylase family. A structural similarity search, performed with the atomic coordinates of domain C of MTase using the DALI server (DALI v2.0),}28 indicated that this domain has the closest structural similarity to the C-domains of Bacillus circulans CGTase25 and Bacillus cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase12 Ê Ê (rms deviation of 2.8 A and 2.4 A for the superimposition of 61 and 60 Ca atoms from the Cdomains of CGTase and oligo-1,6-glucosidase, respectively (Figure 2(a)), showing 18 % and 15 % sequence identity over equivalenced positions). Interestingly, the C-domain in CGTase and its equivalent in maltogenic a-amylase have been implicated in carbohydrate binding.29,30 There is also a remote similarity between domain C of MTase and the fold of the family III cellulose-binding domains (CBDs). For example, for the structures of the CBD from the cellulosomal scaffoldin

However, currently there is no evidence to support the view that the C-domain in MTase is involved in carbohydrate recognition. Furthermore the structural

comparison of MTase and the CBD shows that the carbohydrate-binding surface of the latter is quite different to the equivalent region in MTase (Figure 2(b)). An extra domain at the N terminus is only present in a few members of the a-amylase family, including Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 a-amylase TVA II10 (residues 1-121), Thermus maltogenic

Comparison of the structures of their N-terminal domains with the smaller domain N of MTase (63 residues) reveals that they share no structural similarity. Domain B of MTase (155 residues) is larger than most other B-domains of a-amylases and related enzymes (typically about 40 to 130 residues),1,21 giving rise to a deeper cleft between domains A

and B. This domain shows no close structural similarity to any of the known structures. Binding of maltose and localization of putative active site Previous comparison of the sequence of MTase with other a-amylase family members highlighted the conservation of the three carboxylate groups (Asp385, Glu414 and Asp468) implicated in the catalytic mechanism of the latter.1 Compared with the other family 13 enzymes these residues in MTase

123 mediated hydrogen bonds occur between the nonreducing end glucose unit (gÀ2) C2 hydroxyl group and Asn512 OD1 and between the gÀ1 C6 hydroxyl group and Thr206 OG1 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Tyr158. The reducing end glucose also interacts through van der Waals contacts with the side-chain of Phe537. Among the residues making up the À1 subsite in MTase, ®ve (Tyr158, Arg383, Asp385, Glu414 and Asp468) are invariant throughout family 13 glycoside hydrolases.1,4,23 This is consistent with the fact that the mode of the binding of the À1 glucosyl moiety in MTase is very close to that observed in other a-amylases and related enzymes (Figure 4). In contrast, there are some differences in the position of the À2 glucose unit. Given the speci®city of the enzyme this is not surprising, as the residues at the À2 subsite are important for recognition of the non-reducing end of the substrate and, therefore, for the unique transfer speci®city of MTase. Examination of the environment of the À2 subsite in MTase shows that the C4 Ð O4 bond of the À2 glucosyl moiety points towards a small pocket formed by the stretch of residues 314-317 and the side-chain of Lys151 (Figure 3(d)). The pocket does not contain enough space for a further glucose unit and serves as a stereochemical barrier terminating the active-site cleft consistent with the observed exo-type activity of MTase. Residues 314317 are part of domain B in MTase. Therefore, their involvement in forming a component of the substrate-binding site in MTase is similar to the role of equivalent but structurally distinct B-domains of other family 13 enzymes in substrate recognition. Overall, 83 % of the accessible surface area of the maltose (78 % for ring gÀ1 and 88 % for ring gÀ2) is buried on interaction with the enzyme illustrating that both sites are important for substrate recognition. Again, this is consistent with the strict transfer speci®city of the enzyme. The analysis of this site and its similarities to those in other family 13 enzymes support the view that this pocket de®nes the region of the enzyme involved in the formation of the covalent intermediate between the enzyme and maltose during the catalytic cycle. A second independent maltose-binding site is found in a pocket located on the surface of domain Ê A and approximately 10 A from the active site. Although the density for one glucosyl residue is good, that for the second glucose unit is weak and dif®cult to interpret, suggesting that it is disordered. The shape of the density for the ordered sugar moiety is such that substituents can be seen at ®ve positions around the sugar ring (Figure 3(c)). In addition, the density at one position is clearly larger indicating that this represents the position of the substituent on the C5 atom. Thus, these features allow the unambiguous determination of the position of the glucose ring. Adjacent to the O4 atom, there is insuf®cient space in the binding pocket to accommodate another glucose ring. On the other hand, there is enough space and some residual electron density near the O1 atom,

lie in equivalent positions of the C-terminal end of the barrel, residing on b-strands b9, b10 and on the loop connecting strand b12 and helix a17, respectively. In MTase, this region is part of a deep cleft which lies between domain B and the C-terminal end of the barrel. This clearly identi®es this region as the active site, and an analysis of the electrostatic potential surface of MTase shows the active site pocket to be a region rich in negative charge (Figure 3(a)). Whilst the enzyme cannot form a productive intermediate from maltose alone, X-ray analysis of crystals of MTase grown in the presence of 50 mM maltose revealed two maltose binding sites per subunit (Figure 3). The ®rst maltose binding site (Figures 3(b) and (d)) is located in a shallow pocket on the bottom of the active site cleft, which is the common site for substrate or substrate-analogue complexed structures of a-amylases and related enzymes.7,9,13,17,25,34,35 The positions of the two glucosyl units with respect to the catalytic residues and with respect to the other family 13 enzymes suggest that these two units represent the À2 and À1 subsites (nomenclature as de®ned by Davies et al.36). In common with other a-amylase family enzymes, the binding pocket for the À2 and À1 glucose units (Figure 3(d)) is lined by polar and aromatic residues which are provided by domains A and B. Binding of the maltose in the active site occurs mainly through hydrophobic stacking of its reducing end glucose ring (gÀ1) against the aromatic ring of Tyr158 and a hydrogen bonding network (Figure 3(d), Table 1) involving all of the sugar hydroxyl oxygen atoms, including direct hydrogen bonds to Asp468 OD1 and OD2, Glu414 OE1, Arg383 NH2, Asn512 ND2, Lys151 NZ, Asp317 OD1 and OD2 and Ser156 OG.

The two sugar rings at the À1 and À2 subsites are labelled accordingly and the C4 of the latter is identi®ed. The steric crowding at this latter position is apparent.

sity for the non-reducing end glucosyl residue is similar to that seen for the maltose bound in the active site. This suggests that the second binding site is not an artifact but may have a functional role in the enzyme. The proximity of the secondary sugar binding site to the active site pocket suggests that it might carry a regulatory function or imply activity of this enzyme with branched substrates. Further biochemical studies are needed to clarify this question.

Dimer interface Gel-®ltration studies3 suggest that MTase is a dimer in solution at both neutral (7.0) and acidic (4.8) pH, and this is supported by the analysis of the crystal structure which suggests that the crystallographic 2-fold axis about b represents the molecular 2-fold axis. On forming the dimer, 6.7 % Ê (1700 A2) of the subunit accessible surface area is buried, which is at the low end of the range found for other dimeric proteins.37 The subunits associate via multiple hydrophobic contacts, which involve

127 close to the position of the anomeric carbon C1 of the bound maltose. The third conserved residue of MTase, Asp468, is hydrogen bonded to both the O2 and O3-hydroxyl groups of the À1 glucose unit consistent with the idea that it may function to reduce the electronegativity of the O2 atom of the À1 glucosyl residue as suggested for other members of the a-amylase family.25 Thus far attempts to observe the positions for other sugar binding sites using crystal soaks with maltotetraose and exploiting the lower level of activity of the enzyme at low pH have not proved successful. Comparative structural analysis shows that MTase lacks two histidine residues which are strongly conserved in family 13 members and which ¯ank both sides of the À1 subsite (corresponding to His122 and His296 in TAKA amylase A (Thr206 and Pro467 in MTase, Figure 4)). Structural studies on a-amylases and related enzymes demonstrated that the histidine residue at the position equivalent to Thr206 forms the hydrogen bond with the O6 atom of the À1 sugar.7,9,13,25,34,35 In MTase, this function is performed by the water molecule Wat63 which is hydrogen bonded to the O6 atom of the sugar, the OG1 atom of Thr206 and the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr158. At 75  C (pH 6.5), the transglycosylation activity of MTase with good donor/acceptor substrates is about 1000 to 3000-fold higher than its hydrolytic activity, which is estimated to be about 0.5 unit/ mg protein using soluble starch as the substrate (W.L., unpublished data). Other a-amylase family glucanotransferases of known structure such as CGTases have signi®cantly higher absolute and relative hydrolytic activity than MTase. For example, CGTases from B. circulans strain 251 and T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 show the hydrolytic activity of 3.5 and 23 units/mg, respectively, with the transglycosylation activity being about 250 (B. circulans) and 40 (T. thermosulfurigenes) times higher.38 Since the mode of the binding of the sugar unit at the À1 subsite in MTase and other family 13 hydrolases is very similar, we have compared MTase with the other enzymes to see if there are any structural changes that might favour transglycosylation versus hydrolysis. This comparison shows that the side-chains of the catalytic residues Glu414 and Asp468 in MTase are more remote Ê (6.1 A) than the corresponding residues in other Ê family 13 hydrolases (3.6 to 4.1 A). Whether this is important in determining a low level of hydrolase activity is unclear and further work on the analysis of an intermediate in the enzyme's catalytic cycle and study of inhibitor complexes is essential.

residues of three of the four MTase domains, i.e. N, A and B (Figure 5). Further analysis of intersubunit interactions in the MTase dimer shows that the loop b5/a6 that carries Lys151 in one monomer, is stabilized by contacts with the loop b4/a5 of another monomer. Of these, the van der Waals interactions with the side-chain of Tyr104 in the symmetry-related subunit play a particular role in determining the orientation and the extended conformation of the Lys151 side-chain (Figures 3(d) and 5(b)). The latter has been shown to be involved in recognition of the non-reducing end of the substrate by MTase. Therefore, the dimerization of MTase may be important for exo-type activity and substrate speci®city of the enzyme. Active-site structure Superposition of the structures of MTase, TAKA amylase A35, B. circulans CGTase25 and B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase12 in the region of their active sites shows that the three-dimensional arrangement of the invariant residues making up the À1 subsite (Tyr158, Arg383 and the catalytic carboxylate groups Asp385, Glu414 and Asp468 in MTase) is well conserved in these enzymes (Figure 4)). The structural equivalence of the amino acid residues implicated in catalysis con®rms that MTase is likely to share similar catalytic properties with other members of the a-amylase family. In the crystal structure of the MTase-maltose complex, the OE1 atom of Glu414 is within hydroÊ gen-bonding distance (2.6 A) from the O1 atom of the glucosyl moiety bound at the À1 subsite, consistent with the role of Glu414 as a catalytic acid/ base. In both the native and maltose-bound MTase structures, the conformation of the proposed nucleophile, Asp385 (w1  À 70  ) is found to be distinctly different from that of the equivalent residue in other a-amylase family enzymes (w1 % 180  ) (Figure 4). The Asp385 side-chain points away from the sugar molecule thereby putting its carboxyl group into a position unfavourable for the reaction. The OD2 atom of the Asp385 Ê side-chain is within 2.6 A from the NE atom of Arg383, and the OD1 atom is within hydrogen Ê bonding distance (2.7 A) from Asp201 OD1. The latter suggests that the side-chain of at least one of the two aspartic acid residues is protonated, a situation which is possible at the low pH (4.8) of crystallization. Given the critical role of the Asp385 carboxyl group as a nucleophile in the reaction mechanism, it is quite possible that in the crystal, the enzyme is trapped in an inactive form, with the Asp385 side-chain being protonated. We assume that at higher pH values, an ionized state for both Asp201 and Asp385 would preclude the possibility of a close contact between their sidechains. This would thus result in a different conformation for Asp385. Modelling of the Asp385 sidechain in a conformation seen in other enzymes of this family brings the OD1 atom of Asp385 very

and a monomer in the asymmetric unit. The MTase-maltose crystal complex was obtained by co-crystallization with 50 mM maltose (Fisher Scienti®c International) under similar conditions. These crystals are isomorphous Ê with those of the free enzyme (a  b  147.4 A, Ê c  105.6 A). A mercury derivative was obtained by co-crystallization of the enzyme with 0.25 mM ethyl mercuric phosphate (EMP) and four other derivative crystals were prepared by soaking crystals in either potassium tetrachloro platinate (2 mM), potassium tetrabromo-aurate (0.5 mM), potassium tetrachloro-palladate (1 mM) or an equimolar mixture of EMP and potassium tetrachloroplatinate (1 mM). Diffraction data sets for one native (NativeI) and ®ve derivative crystals were collected at room temperature using a MAR345 image plate detector and platinum/nickel mirror-focused CuKa X-rays produced with a Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode generator. To perform data collection at cryogenic temperatures, the droplet containing the crystals was gradually saturated with glycerol up to 35 % (v/v), in 5 % increments, bathing the crystals in each solution for approximately 30 seconds. The crystal was then ¯ash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream device. Diffraction data for the free enzyme Ê (NativeII) were collected to 2.4 A using a MAR345 image plate detector on station 7.2 at the SRS Daresbury Laboratory. Diffraction data for the MTase-maltose complex Ê were collected to 2.1 A using a CCD detector on station 9.6 at the SRS Daresbury Laboratory. All the data were processed and scaled using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package39 and subsequently handled using CCP4 software.40 Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 2. Structure determination The structure of MTase was determined using the method of multiple isomorphous replacement. The major mercury site was determined from the isomorphous difference Patterson synthesis for the EMP derivative. The locations of the heavy atom sites for the other derivatives were determined by difference Fourier methods. Re®nement of heavy atom parameters and calculation of phases were carried out with MLPHARE40 (Table 2). The overall ®gure of merit of the resulting

phase set was 0.60 for 15,818 re¯ections between 15.0 Ê and 3.2 A. An improved map was obtained by combined solvent ¯attening and histogram matching as implemented in DM,41 with a solvent content of 66 %. A partial model of MTase incorporating 82 % of all residues (1-238 and 354-636) was built from this map using the programs FRODO42 and O.43 After re®nement with TNT,44 phases from this partial model and the isomorphous replacement phases were combined in SIGMAA45 to generate an improved map. The re®nement and phase combination procedure was repeated with a 90 % complete model, after which all but the ®nal carboxy-terminal residue of the 637 residue polypetide chain were incorporated. Finally, re®nement against data Ê between 10.0 and 2.4 A (NativeII) was performed with CNS.46 Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the models was accomplished using PROCHECK.27 The electron density indicated that three phosphate ions were bound to MTase. The ®nal re®ned model of MTase contains 636 of the expected 637 amino acid residues, three phosphate ions and 259 water molecules (R-factor 0.208, Rfree 0.263). All the non-glycine residues lie in permitted regions of the Ramachandran plot with 88 % of these in the most favoured regions. Re®nement statistics are given in Table 3. The structure of the MTase-maltose complex was solved directly by re®nement of the model of native MTase with all solvent molecules removed. Subsequent difference Fourier maps clearly revealed density corresponding to two carbohydrate-binding sites. This density was interpreted as a maltose molecule, occupying the subsites À2 and À1 in the active site, and a non-reducing end glucosyl moiety of another maltose molecule, bound in a pocket near the active site cleft. The maltose and glucose molecules were incorporated into the model, with all the sugar rings in the 4C1 chair form and the structure was re®ned with CNS (R-factor 0.197, Rfree 0.252). When re®ned with sugar occupancies ®xed at 0.5, the average B-factors for the maltose at the active site Ê (34 A2) and the glucosyl moiety of the second maltose Ê (45 A2) are similar to that of the surrounding protein, suggesting that both the sugar molecules are bound at reduced occupancy. The ®nal (2Fobs À Fcalc)exp(iacalc) map showed weak residual density adjacent to the O1 atom of the modelled glucose at the second site, pointing to a further, mobile glucosyl unit, which has not been

130
®tted. The ®nal re®ned model of the MTase-maltose complex contains 636 amino acid residues, three phosphate ions, maltose, a-D-glucose and 337 water molecules. The re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 3. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates of MTase and its complex with maltose have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1gju and 1gjw.
