The structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) capsid protein (CA), with an upstream 25 amino acid residue extension corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the Gag p10 protein, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Purified Gag proteins of retroviruses can assemble in vitro into virus-like particles closely resembling in vivo-assembled immature virus particles, but without a membrane. When the 25 amino acid residues upstream of CA are deleted, Gag assembles into tubular particles. The same phenotype is observed in vivo. Thus, these residues act as a "shape determinant" promoting spherical assembly, when they are present, or tubular assembly, when they are absent. We show that, unlike the NTD on its own, the extended NTD protein has no b-hairpin loop at the N terminus of CA and that the molecule forms a dimer in which the amino-terminal extension forms the interface between monomers. Since dimerization of Gag has been inferred to be a critical step in assembly of spherical, immature Gag particles, the dimer interface may represent a structural feature that is essential in retrovirus assembly.

Introduction
The structural protein Gag regulates retrovirus assembly. Most retroviruses are formed initially as spherical Gag particles at the plasma membrane of infected cells.1 During, or shortly after, budding from the membrane, the viral protease cleaves Gag into its constituent proteins, including the matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins. This process, referred to as maturation, results in a change in shape of the viral core. Although all retroviruses have spherical immature cores, the shape of the mature core depends on the virus genus. For example, lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),

have mostly conical cores, while alpha retroviruses, such as the prototypic Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), have cores with the appearance of irregular polyhedra.2,3 After maturation, MA associates with the viral membrane, CA forms the shell of the mature core, and NC associates with the genomic RNA and other virally coded enzymes required for RNA replication inside the CA shell. Whereas the CA ­CA contacts in the mature core of HIV-1 have been modeled with respect to a cryo-electron microscopic (cryoEM) reconstruction4 and electron crystallography of two-dimensional crystals,5,6 much less is known about the Gag ­ Gag contacts in immature retrovirus cores.7,8 The morphogenetic changes in the Gag particle can be mimicked by in vitro assembly of Gag or modified Gag proteins. For RSV, the 25 carboxyterminal amino acid residues in the sequence of p10, located between the MA and CA proteins, differentiate between the formation of tubes or spheres in the assembly process.9,10 The role of the MA ­CA junction in HIV-1 Gag in vitro assembly was examined by von Schwedler et al.11 and Gross

276 et al.,12 who showed that tubes are formed when MA is completely deleted. However, various sized spherical particles are formed when four or more MA carboxy-terminal residues remain fused to CA. The structure of retrovirus CA, or one or another of its two domains, has been determined for HIV,13 ­ 18 for RSV,19,20 for equine infectious anemia virus,21 and for human T-cell leukemia virus type I.22 The two domains are linked by a highly flexible peptide, making it difficult to crystallize the whole CA protein. The amino-terminal domain (NTD) has about 146 residues and consists of seven, roughly parallel and antiparallel a-helices. There is a short, 14 amino acid residue-long b-hairpin maintained by the buried Asp52 (RSV numbering), which forms a salt-bridge with the amino terminus. Mutagenesis11,23 and structural studies18 of HIV-1 suggest that the NTD b-hairpin is formed only after the maturation cleavage event that liberates the N terminus of CA, which led to the hypothesis that the b-hairpin and salt-bridge between Pro1 and Asp52 of CA are required for the assembly of tubes. Indeed, under conditions used in NMR spectroscopy, the b-hairpin is absent from an HIV-1 protein comprising the MA and N-terminal CA domains.18 As proposed originally by von Schwedler et al.,11 the presence of an N-terminal extension in the CA protein might prevent the formation of the b-hairpin, holding the protein in a conformation in which it assembles into spheres.11 The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), comprising roughly 75 residues, forms a bundle of four a-helices. In HIV-1, and not in other retroviruses,19,21,22 the CTDs dimerize in vitro, as does CA itself, and this dimer is inferred to be critical for the assembly of mature conical cores.15,24 Helical cryoEM reconstructions,4 together with the X-ray and NMR structures of the two CA

domains, have led to a low-resolution concept of the mature, conical HIV particle structure. The EM results show that the repeating hexameric density can be assigned to six copies of the NTD CA. Each NTD in the hexamer is connected to an NTD in a neighboring hexamer by CTD ­CTD interactions beneath the plane of the hexameric lattice. This model is also consistent with electron diffraction from two-dimensional crystals.5,6 However, although they were not envisioned in the original model, apparently heterotypic NTD ­ CTD contacts also occur.25 It is unclear to what extent this structure of the mature core reflects the organization of Gag molecules in immature particles, although the latter also appears to be built on a hexagonal lattice,5,26 but one of slightly smaller dimension (J. Briggs, M. C. J., M. Simon, S. Fuller & V. M. V., unpublished results). Here, we report the structure of the RSV CA protein NTD extended by the 25 amino acid residues that are upstream of CA in Gag. We show that the b-hairpin is unfolded and that the protein crystallizes as a dimer. The dimer interface includes specific residues previously inferred to be critical for assembly of RSV Gag10 and also corresponds to portions of the equivalent HIV protein recently implicated in immature assembly.23

Results and Discussion
The structure of the amino-terminally extended NTD of RSV CA (25NTD) (Figure 1a) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. It includes four residues, Gly-Pro-Thr-Ser (GPTS), a remnant of the protein cleavage site used to generate the final protein, followed by the carboxy-terminal 25 residues of p10, and finally the NTD of the CA

277 annealing omit map27 shows a reasonable degree of order for the amino-terminal extension (Figure 3). In contrast to the RSV NTD dimer reported previously, the 25NTD dimer has a substantial dimer interface. The structure of the NTD CA dimer19 has the b-hairpin placed well away from the ° small, 250 A2, monomer ­monomer interface. This interaction is mainly through hydrophobic residues and is mediated by a metal ion, coordinated octahedrally, that is derived from the crystallization solution. This NTD CA dimer structure cannot be accommodated in the proposed hexamer of mature retrovirus cores and, therefore, probably is a crystallization artifact.4 On the other hand, in the 25NTD crystal structure, the molecules related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis have a large, ° 2100 A2, area of contact (Figure 3(a)). The monomer ­ monomer interface within this dimer reduces the exposed surface area of the monomer by 20%. This interface consists, in part, of hydrophobic interactions, as well as 14 hydrogen bonds between the amino-terminal extension and helices a1 and a3, and also between a6 and itself (Figure 4, Table 1). As much as 80% of the area of the dimer interface involves the 25 residues upstream of the NTD. In a previous study,10 random mutations were introduced into the 25 residue extension of the RSV NTD to investigate their impact on the ability of the Gag protein to assemble in Escherichia coli and in vitro. Some mutations changed the spherical assembly of the parent protein into tubular assembly, some abrogated assembly entirely, and others had no effect. Interpretation of these phenotypes is complicated by the presence of more than

protein. The sequencing nomenclature used here is that the RSV NTD component is numbered 1 to 146, consistent with the RSV sequence. Thus, the amino-terminal extension is numbered 2 28 to 2 25 for the GPTS fragment and 2 24 to 0 for the p10 component (Figure 1b). The core of the 25NTD structure from residue 14 to residue 146 is indistinguishable from the structure of the isolated NTD, with an r.m.s. deviation ° of 0.8 A between Ca atoms (Figure 2). However, the first 14 residues (Pro1 to Leu14), which form the b-hairpin in the isolated NTD,19 are folded differently (Figure 2) as is also the case for the amino-terminal residues of HIV CA in a structure in which MA was not cleaved from CA.18 These residues, together with the 25 amino acid residues from p10, do not form a b-hairpin, but fold into an extended loop that includes a two-turn a-helix. This loop and helix form a dimer interface with respect to a 2-fold related monomer within the crystal. Residues 10 to 146 of 25NTD are well ordered. However, the four GPTS amino-terminal residues and residues 2 28 to 2 22 and 2 12 to 2 2 of p10 have considerable mobility with a mean ° ° temperature factor of 89 A2 as compared to 52 A2 for the rest of the structure (Figure 1a). Although the least radiation-affected data had been used in the structure determination, differences in conformation of the amino-terminal extension were observed when data were included from crystals that had had greater radiation damage. Of the 25 residues in the amino-terminal extension, 17 are in the monomer ­monomer interface, and only four of these are in poor density. A composite simulated

one amino acid change in most of the mutants. A correlation between residues in the dimer interface (Table 1) and mutations that affect assembly is uncertain. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the 25-residue extension of CA into p10, the determinant for the assembly of Gag into spherical particles, creates a totally different dimer interface than occurs in crystal structures of the NTD CA domain and that the interface in the 25NTD structure is largely determined by these 25 residues. It is also relevant that both in vitro28,29 and in vivo30 studies of RSV Gag implicate dimerization as being critical for assembly. These observations suggest that the dimer interface seen in the 25NTD crystal structure also occurs in RSV Gag

molecules when they are forming spherical, immature particles. The formation of this dimer interface would be precluded in the mature RSV virus, both by the folding of the b-hairpin after cleavage of Gag into its component proteins and by the truncation of the 25 residues from the body of the CA protein. Indirect evidence suggests that residues equivalent to those involved in the RSV 25NTD dimer interface are important for assembly of immature HIV-1 Gag particles. Mutations that led to severe defects in formation of virus particles in vivo,23 but had no effect on the ability of purified CA protein to form mature tubular or conical cores in vitro (W. I. Sundquist, personal communication) are

The reflections were integrated and the frames were placed onto a common scale with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs, respectively.32 ° The final data set was 85.2% complete to 2.45 A resolution (51.4% in the highest-resolution range) with an Rmerge of 5.5% (32.9%) and a redundancy of measurement of 3.18 (1.4).

The r.m.s. deviations from ideal° ized values were 0.11 A for bond lengths and 2.18 for bond angles. All of the residues are in the allowed region of the Ramachandran diagram, with 82% being in the most favored region.

molecules be packed and what structural changes might occur during maturation? In light of the disposition of the MA protein around the inside of the viral membrane and the association of the NC protein with the RNA genome, generally it has been assumed that the MA, CA, and NC domains along Gag are arranged in a roughly linear array along the radius of Gag particles, with MA being on the exterior. For HIV-1, this organization leaves the cyclophilin A-binding site in CA on the exterior of CA once MA has been cleaved.13 The cryoEM structure of the mature HIV-1 core18 in which the CA proteins make parallel contacts (Figure 5), is consistent with these principles. However, in the 25NTD crystal structure, the carboxy termini of the two 25NTD monomers are at opposing ends of the dimer, which would leave the two CTDs far away from the central dimer axis. Hence, it is proposed that bending at the linker region between NTD and CTD could restore the CTDs to a position that is consistent with the radial orientation of Gag domains (Figure 5a). Maturation of the particle by proteolytic cleavages would then require further re-alignment of the NTD and CTD to form the hexagonal ring of NTDs (Figure 5b).

Materials and Methods
An expression construct was engineered into the vector pET3XC (Novagen), which contained a His6 tag followed by a 3C protease cleavage site (EVLFQGP), a SpeI restriction site (ThrSer), and amino acid residues 215­ 385 of RSV-Gag (1­ 146 of the RSV NTD). The precursor protein was introduced into E. coli expression strain BL21 PLys S (Novagen). Cells were grown in 2YT medium to an A600 of 0.5, induced for four hours with 1 mM IPTG, collected by centrifugation, submitted to one freeze/thaw cycle, and finally resuspended in 20 ml/l of 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. Following sonication, the lysate was ultracentrifuged at 250,000 g for three hours, filtered, and bound to a 5 ml Ni-Sepharose column. Protein was eluted with elution buffer (500 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl), adjusted to 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and digested with approximately 1% (w/w) His6-tagged 3C protease for two hours at 37 8C. Following digestion, the protein was adjusted to 20 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl by gel filtration and passed serially over Ni-Sepharose, HiTrap Q, and HiTrap SP columns (Amersham). The flow-through protein was mixed with an equal volume of water, concentrated in a Biomax Ultrafree centrifugal filter, and stored at 2 80 8C. Crystals were grown by vapor-diffusion methods. The protein sample (, 12 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM NaCl) was equilibrated at 20 8C against the reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Na Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.8 M potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline ID14b at the Advanced Photon Source. All data were collected at 20 8C because flash freezing the crystals, using a variety of cryo solvents, resulted in poorly diffracting, twinned crystals with space group P21 ° ° ° (a ¼ 44.3 A, b ¼ 160.0 A, c ¼ 135.0 A, and b ¼ 80.08). The room temperature crystals belonged to space group
