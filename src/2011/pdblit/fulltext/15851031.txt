The mechanism of pore formation by bacterial toxins
Sarah J Tilley and Helen R Saibil
A remarkable group of proteins challenge the notions that protein sequence determines a unique three-dimensional structure, and that membrane and soluble proteins are very distinct. The pore-forming toxins typically transform from soluble, monomeric proteins to oligomers that form transmembrane channels. Recent structural studies provide ideas about how these changes take place. The recently solved structures of the b-pore-forming toxins LukS, e-toxin and intermedilysin confirm that the pore-forming regions are initially folded up on the surfaces of the soluble precursors. To create the transmembrane pores, these regions must extend and refold into membrane-inserted b-barrels.

members of this family are still very unclear. The bacterial toxin colicin targets Escherichia coli cells by making pores that leak ions, depolarizing the membrane and ultimately causing cell death. Colicins usually contain three domains that are involved in receptor binding, transport and killing. Depending on the colicin, the toxic (killing) domain either inhibits protein or peptidoglycan synthesis, or has nuclease or pore-forming activity. The other domains are used to bind and translocate the toxic domain into the bacterial cell. Structures have been determined of the pore-forming domains from colicins A and E1, along with the complete structures of colicins Ia, B and N [1­5]. The pore-forming domains are globular and contain ten a-helices (Figure 1a). Two hydrophobic helices lie at the core and form a hydrophobic helical hairpin that inserts into the membrane during the early stages of pore formation, by the mechanism described below.

The pore-forming domain of diphtheria toxin also contains ten a-helices and includes a hydrophobic hairpin similar to that of the colicins [6] (Figure 1b). This a-PFT from the binary toxin family (A-B toxins) consists of two disulfide-linked chains resulting from protoxin cleavage. One chain contains the receptor-binding and pore-forming domains. The latter domain translocates the second chain, containing the catalytic domain, through the endosomal membrane to the cytosol, where it inhibits protein synthesis and kills the cell.
Variations in the a-pore-forming domain

Introduction
Bacterial toxins are some of the most potent poisons known to man. During invasion, bacterial toxins may inhibit a specific process, such as protein synthesis, or inflict a more general type of assault by punching holes in the membrane. The pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are `hole punchers'; the pores either deliver toxic components to specific cellular sites or kill cells through leakage. PFTs are interesting from several view points: many are virulence factors for disease, they challenge accepted ideas about protein sequence/structure relationships, and they also have potential as biotechnological sensors and delivery systems. PFTs are classified according to whether they form ahelical channels (a-PFTs) or b-barrels (b-PFTs). Here, we discuss recent examples of structural studies that are helping to unravel how these proteins transform from the soluble state to membrane-inserted pores. Not all a-PFTs have an obvious hydrophobic hairpin. Despite structural similarity to both diphtheria and colicin pore-forming domains, the six a-helices that form the translocating pore of exotoxin A from Pseudomonas are not predominantly hydrophobic [7]. This is also true of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins, which cause osmotic lysis in the insect midgut. These proteins contain one domain that determines specificity, and two others that form the pore and modulate its properties. A recent structure of the mosquito-larvicidal toxin Cry4Ba demonstrates that only five of the seven a-helices in the pore-forming domain are necessary for toxicity [8]. This toxin is thought to form a membrane-inserting hairpin, as in colicins and diphtheria toxin, but the five amphipathic helices are arranged in a bundle with the most hydrophobic helix at the centre.

domain, which releases the hydrophobic helices that initiate insertion. For diphtheria toxin, which forms pores in the endosomal membrane, insertion of the hydrophobic hairpin is followed by insertion of the remaining poreforming helices [10]. In this case, acidification of the endosomes triggers unfolding. Recent evidence points to specific acidic residues that act as pH sensors in both the colicins and exotoxin A. A low pH environment disrupts a critical salt bridge and hydrogen-bonding network involving three conserved aspartate residues in colicin E1, causing local unfolding of a helix [11]. In exotoxin A, acidification neutralizes the charge on an aspartate residue at the end of a short length of helix, also triggering helix unfolding. This exposes a tryptophan residue that interacts with the membrane (Figure 1c), triggering insertion of the pore-forming domain [12]. In one case, the oligomeric state of an a-PFT has been determined. Monomers of the Cry1Ab toxin bind to one receptor, oligomerise into tetramers and then bind to a second receptor that targets the complex into membrane rafts, where the pores insert [13].
Unfolded intermediates and lipid structures

for small antimicrobial peptides [16]. In this model, the protein exerts a detergent-like action, inducing high curvature in the bilayer. Toroidal lipidic pores are characterized by their sensitivity to lipids that alter the curvature of the membrane, as is the case with colicin E1 pores [17]. Such a pore could be lined by shorter helices than those that would normally traverse the bilayer.
Other a-pore-forming proteins

Further details on the a-PFT mechanism may come from sources other than bacterial toxins. The BCL-2 family of proteins regulates the apotoptic pathway and shares structural homology with the a-PFT pore-forming domains. They release mitochondrial apoptogenic factors by permeabilising the outer mitochondrial membrane (reviewed in [18]). Although the hydrophobic hairpin is present, it does not deeply insert and span the membrane [19]. Further work is needed before we can tell whether all these disparate features are snapshots of different intermediates, or whether a-PFTs follow different pathways and ultimately form different pores.
b-Pore-forming toxins

Intramolecular distance measurements on the partly inserted state suggest that the helices are loosely associated on the membrane surface, with the hydrophobic hairpin or aromatic residues inserted into the bilayer [14]. This was recently confirmed by measuring the inter- and intra-helical distances of colicin Ia by NMR [15]. However, the structure of the pore state is still very unclear. A model of the diphtheria toxin pore based on mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopy data supports the full insertion of the helical hairpin and suggests partial insertion of the remaining helices [10]. One problem with understanding the membrane-inserted form of the colicin pore is that the helices are too short to span a standard bilayer [9], although an increase in a-helical content indicates that they might lengthen before inserting [14]. A possible current model of the colicin pore is that of the toroidal lipidic pore, based on the model proposed
www.sciencedirect.com

The insertion pathways and pore structures of b-PFTs are much better understood than those of the a-PFTs. b-PFTs are released as soluble monomers that oligomerise before forming active pores. The final insertion step often requires significant refolding of part of the structure, so that subunits can donate b-strands to form a transmembrane b-barrel.
a-Hemolysin family

Named for their hemolytic activity, toxins from the Staphylococcus aureus hemolysin family form well-characterized pores. Members include heptameric a-hemolysin (a-HL) (Figure 2a) and the leukocidins, which form hetero-octamers of LukF and LukS subunits (Figure 2b,c) [20]. Like other b-PFTs, a-HL interacts directly with lipid vesicles, although it may bind to an

unidentified receptor in vivo, possibly caveolin-1 [21]. a-HL oligomerises into a non-lytic heptamer on the membrane surface. This prepore state is a common feature of other b-PFTs and can be trapped with suitably engineered disulfide bonds [22]. The conformational changes that occur during membrane insertion have been identified by comparing the monomeric structures from the bicomponent leukocidin system with the pore state of a-HL (reviewed in [23]). The hemolysin subunit has three domains -- the cap, rim and stem -- with mainly b-structure. In the water-soluble state, the stem forms b-strands that fold against the monomer core [24]. To form the distinctive mushroom shape of the pore, the stem domains flip out and refold into b-hairpins to form a perfect transmembrane b-barrel [25] (Figure 3a,b).
Aerolysin toxins

only structural model of the pore state for this family was created by docking the soluble aerolysin structure into a negative-stain EM map [26]. The pore-forming regions were identified by modelling AT based on the aerolysin structure. Fluorescence and biochemical techniques were used to confirm that they comprise a loop of 30 residues with alternating hydrophobic/hydrophilic character [31]. The equivalent region in the ETX structure is a loop containing a pair of b-strands (Figure 2e).
Anthrax toxin

Aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila is an elongated fourdomain protein rich in b-structure [26] (Figure 2d). etoxin (ETX) from Clostridium perfringens is a structural homologue of aerolysin (Figure 2e) [27], whereas a-toxin (AT) from Clostridium septicum has been identified on the basis of high sequence homology. All three toxins are activated by protease cleavage, after which they bind to unidentified receptors, oligomerise and form heptameric pores [28­30]. However, aerolysin does not form a prepore before inserting, which is unusual for a b-PFT. The
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2006, 16:230­236

Like their a-PFT equivalents, b-PFT examples of binary toxins translocate toxic components into cells. The protective antigen (PA) from anthrax toxin forms the pore that delivers lethal factor and edema factor to the cytosol. Anthrax PA was first crystallized in soluble monomeric and heptameric forms [32] (Figures 2f and 3c,d), and structures of both forms have recently been determined in complex with their receptor [33,34]. Although the structure of the membrane-penetrating heptamer has not yet been solved, these structures provide many details about the mechanism of pore formation. PA has four domains and consists of mainly antiparallel b-sheets. Proteolytic cleavage of PA produces PA63, which oligomerises and inserts into the membrane. Because anthrax pores are formed in the endosomal membrane, it is no surprise that heptameric PA63 inserts at low pH [34],

unlike other b-PFTs. The membrane-spanning region has been identified as a loop that packs between monomers in the soluble heptameric structure [34]. In the pore form, this loop is thought to refold into a b-hairpin that is part of an unusually long, 14-stranded transmem° brane b-barrel that extends 40 A above the membrane surface. The resulting large gap is thought to be filled with the membrane-bound receptor [33].
Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins

Literally hole punchers, the cholesterol-dependent cyto° lysins (CDCs) form 250 A pores comprising rings of 30­ 50 subunits. They form a highly conserved family found in many Gram-positive bacteria. So far, crystal structures are available of the water-soluble monomers of perfringolysin and intermedilysin [35,36] (Figure 2g). These four-domain proteins are similar to members of the aerolysin family, sharing an elongated b-rich structure. Produced as soluble monomers or dimers [37], CDCs appear to bind to cholesterol, with the notable exception of intermedilysin, which binds the specific receptor CD59 [38]. After binding to the membrane surface, the CDCs form a well-characterized prepore state that can be trapped by mutagenesis or low temperature. Perfringolysin has been extensively probed using mutagenesis and spectroscopy to define the membranewww.sciencedirect.com

inserting regions. Whereas most b-PFTs donate one hairpin to the transmembrane b-barrel, CDCs donate two [39,40], creating large pores that leak macromolecules and smaller solutes. Although all PFTs rearrange their structure to form the pore, these toxins are the only example known to switch secondary structure. Each bhairpin originates from an a-helical bundle in the soluble monomer. Before insertion can occur, this region must be brought to the membrane surface. We recently obtained electron density maps of prepores and pores of the CDC pneumolysin, which is closely related to perfringolysin, using cryo-EM and docking of the perfringolysin domains [41]. In the prepore, the subunits resemble the extended soluble monomer, with the pore-forming regions far above the membrane surface. In the pore structure, the domains separate, and the domain containing the transmembrane region swings out and is brought ° 30 A closer to the membrane by the collapse of another domain, forming an arch structure (Figure 4). A similar height decrease of the protein above the membrane surface was observed in the perfringolysin prepore-to-pore conversion by atomic force microscopy [42]. In the cryoEM reconstruction, the membrane is deformed by its interaction with the protein and the pore lumen is completely empty, apparently after extrusion of the missing disk of membrane. The pore is lined by protein density consistent with the length of b-hairpins extending across

the bilayer to form the pore wall, which comprises a b-barrel with up to 176 strands (Figure 4). What triggers insertion into the membrane? Oligomerisation in the prepore causes changes in the domain packing arrangement and may help to trigger the subsequent opening up of the cavity in the pore conformation [41]. Both cholesterol and a conserved tryptophan-rich motif in the membrane-binding domain are involved in the prepore-to-pore conversion [36,43], suggesting that cholesterol does more than act as a receptor for CDCs. Cholesterol may fill the interstitial spaces around the protein to allow an unusual protein­lipid interaction in which the arch of protein effects a 308 bend in the bilayer [41] (Figure 4b).
Eukaryotic b-pore-forming toxins

are able to insert spontaneously, more like b-barrels. There are still many issues to be understood concerning the interaction between toxin and membrane. A general strategy appears to be that pore regions are buried or pack against the surface of the soluble structure, and then exchange their protein­protein interactions for protein­ lipid interactions in a stable new assembly. The protein may act by inserting a wedge into the membrane, changing its curvature and ultimately puncturing the bilayer to form a stable pore lining.

Conclusions
As multiple structures of toxin family members are identified, structural comparisons help us to identify common motifs and design experiments that probe their poreforming mechanisms. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to model pore formation and membrane rupture in lipid bilayers [48]. However, many aspects of the protein structural transformations are still obscure. In particular, a-helical membrane proteins are normally inserted by the Sec61 translocon machinery, but a-PFTs
