Longins are the only R-SNAREs that are common to all eukaryotes and are characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain with a profilin-like fold called a longin domain (LD). These domains seem to be essential for regulating membrane trafficking and they mediate unexpected biochemical functions via a range of protein­protein and intramolecular binding specificities. In addition to the longins, proteins involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking, such as subunits of the adaptor and transport protein particle complexes, also have LD-like folds. The functions and cellular localization of longins are regulated at several levels and the longin prototypes TI-VAMP, Sec22 and Ykt6 show different distributions among eukaryotes, reflecting their modular and functional diversity. In mammals, TI-VAMP and Ykt6 are crucial for neuronal function, and defects in longin structure or function might underlie some human neurological pathologies. The general conservation of proteins involved in intracellular vesicle transport is likely to reflect the conservation of molecular mechanisms both within and across species. Indeed, both the homotypic and heterotypic fusion of intracellular membranes along the secretory and endocytic pathway are mediated by a family of SNAREs [soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptors] [1]. SNAREs share a-helical coiled-coil domains, called `SNARE motifs', that probably evolved from a common ancestor and are composed of a repeated hydrophobic heptad register [2] that is interrupted at the so-called `zero' layer by a conserved arginine or glutamine polar residue [3]. On the basis of this observation, SNAREs are often referred to as R- or Q-SNAREs [4]; alternatively, they are known as v- or t-SNAREs, depending on their localization to either the transport vesicle (v) or the target (t) membrane [1]. SNARE-mediated fusion typically results from the formation of a complex consisting of one R-SNARE and

three Q-SNARE motifs [5]. In this context, Q-SNAREs can be subdivided into Qa- (syntaxin), Qb- [25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) N-terminal SNARE motif] or Qc- (SNAP-25 C-terminal SNARE motif) SNAREs [6]. The R-SNAREs can be also subdivided into short VAMPs (vesicle-associated membrane proteins) or `brevins' (from the Latin word brevis, meaning short) and long VAMPs or `longins', on the basis of whether they contain a short and variable domain or a conserved longin domain (LD) of 120­140 amino acids at their N terminus [7]. Curiously, the longins are the only R-SNAREs that are conserved in all eukaryotes; other R-SNAREs show a more restricted distribution. For example, synaptobrevins, which have been studied extensively, are missing in multicellular eukaryotes such as plants [7­9] and share specific SNARE motifs that are limited to Bilateria [10]. This observation suggests that the LD is likely to be an essential module and that the R-SNARE motif of longins can substitute for that of the brevins [8]. The bioinformatic analysis that defined a profile for the LD also identified three subfamilies of longins [7], tetanus neurotoxininsensitive VAMP (TI-VAMP; also known as VAMP7) [11,12], Sec22 [13] and Ykt6 [14], all of which are involved in fundamental cell trafficking pathways. Here we review recent findings on the structure and function of LDs that facilitate a deeper understanding of the regulation and fine-tuning of SNARE functions and other molecular mechanisms that are crucial to eukaryotic cell viability, growth and differentiation.

Molecular organization and functions of LDs Figure 1 compares the domain architecture of longins to that of other SNAREs. Both longins and syntaxins have N-terminal domains (NTDs) that can downregulate membrane fusion [15­17]. When the 3D structures of the NTDs of the longins Ykt6 and Sec22b were solved, however, the LD was found to show a conserved profilinlike fold that differed considerably from that of the NTD of syntaxins [18,19] (Box 1).

Figure 1. Domain architectures of longins and other types of SNARE. All SNAREs share conserved coiled-coil domains (SNARE motifs) of the R (light blue) or Q (dark blue) type. Among the VAMPs (vesicle-associated membrane proteins), longins share a widely conserved longin domain (LD, yellow), whereas brevins have a short and variable N-terminal domain (NTD, violet) [7]. Other R-SNAREs can have either specific (light green) or conserved (dark green) NTDs [8]. Syntaxins have a domain architecture that is similar to longins but a different NTD (grey). Most SNAREs have transmembrane domains (red), but the SNAP-25 (25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein) and Ykt6 longins associate with membranes by lipid anchors (magenta).

Intramolecular binding of the NTD of neuronal syntaxin to its SNARE motif mediates the formation of a `closed conformation' that is necessary to bind Munc18, a protein of the Sec/Munc (SM) family [20]. A similar `conformation-dependent' modulation of binding capacity has been suggested to occur in some longins [21]; however, not all syntaxins use the same

mechanism to bind SM proteins [20], and so far intramolecular binding among the longins has been demonstrated only for Ykt6 [18]. The LD of TI-VAMP can inhibit the formation of a fusion complex [17] and, although intramolecular binding has not been confirmed, the occurrence of low-affinity intramolecular interactions in TI-VAMP cannot be ruled out [22].

Box 1. Structures of longin and longin-like domains
The longin domains (LDs) of Ykt6 [18] and Sec22b [19] show the same globular fold (Figure I), comprising a five-stranded b-sheet core sandwiched between an a-helix on one side and two a-helices on the other. This fold differs from the N-terminal domain (NTD) of syntaxins [20] and resembles a circular permutation of GAF/PAS domains, a large and widespread family of small-molecule binding regulatory modules, and profilin, a widely expressed protein that can bind diverse ligands including polyphosphoinositides [23­25]. The LD of Ykt6 contains a hydrophobic patch that can inhibit the formation of a fusion complex by binding intramolecularly to the coiled-coil domain (SNARE motif); mutation of a conserved phenylalanine residue in this patch abrogates this interaction [18]. Moreover, a recently identified putative binding groove for palmitoyl groups possibly ensures the solubility of the lipid-modified cytoplasmic form of Ykt6 [66]. Despite a lack of sequence similarity to longins, the human protein SEDL (also known as Sedlin) has been recently shown to have an LD-like fold, and mutations that alter its structure (Figure I) are causative for a cartilage disorder [71]. The SEDL orthologue in yeast is part of the transport protein particle termed TRAPP, which contributes to the fidelity of membrane fusion at the ER to Golgi compartment by controlling the tethering process. TRAPP can exchange the nucleotide of Ypt1p GTPase (an event that occurs upstream of the interactions between v- and t-SNAREs) [72]. The InterPro database [73] contains a signature for longin-like domains (accession number IPR011012) that are shared by more than 350 proteins, including longins, SEDL and the assembly domain of adaptins m2 and s2. These adaptins are two of the proteins that make up the core of AP2, a complex that functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and binds polyphosphoinositides [74]. Despite a lack of significant sequence homology, the folds of s2 (Figure I) and the NTD of m2 are structurally almost identical to each other and also share a strong similarity with the LD fold [75]. The structure of AP2 suggests that the LD-like domains of s2 and m2 have a predominantly structural role, stabilizing the core of the tetrameric adaptor assembly [74,75]. Evidence that proteins and protein domains from an adaptor complex have an LD-like fold is intriguing, considering that the LD can target TI-VAMP to the late endosomal complex through a direct interaction with an adaptor complex protein [22].

Indeed, recent evidence suggests that LDs are likely to mediate several shared as well as specific molecular mechanisms, in agreement with evidence indicating that profilin-like domains have multiple functions [23­25]. For example, the LD of human TI-VAMP has dual roles: it can negatively regulate the ability of either TI-VAMP or a LD-synaptobrevin chimera to participate in SNARE complexes, and it can target TI-VAMP to the late endosomal compartment [22]. The LD of Ykt6 (but not that of Sec22) can target the protein to a specialized compartment in neurons [26], and the LD of yeast Ykt6 mediates acylation of the fusion factor Vac8 during an early step of homotypic vacuole fusion [27,28]. The fact that TI-VAMP can bind to a subunit of a clathrin coat adaptor complex (AP) [22] and that Ykt6 is involved in distinct steps of the membrane fusion reaction including tethering (in which a transport vesicle is docked onto its target membrane before the pairing of SNAREs) [27,29,30] is not surprising, considering that some tethering factors and AP subunits have a longin-like fold (Box 1) and that the NTDs of other SNAREs can bind tethering complexes [31,32]. Although a few longins show slightly degenerate sequences that are not recognized by the LD profile, most correspond to the TI-VAMP, Sec22 and Ykt6 prototypes and show both shared and specific moieties and molecular and cellular functions. TI-VAMP Depending on the type of cell, TI-VAMP has been found to interact in vivo with several t-SNARE heavy chains (plasmalemmal syntaxin 1, 3 and 4, and late endosomal syntaxin 7) and light chains (SNAP-23, -25 and -29, syntaxins 6, 8 and 10, and Vti1b), but not with syntaxin 16 (in the Golgi) or syntaxin 13 (in early endosomes) [11,17,22,29,33­36]. Although physiological roles for all of these associations remain to be determined, these interactions clearly indicate that TI-VAMP is involved in plasmalemmal and late endosomal membrane fusion events [37]. In addition, the involvement of TI-VAMP in the degradation pathway of epithelial growth factor [38] and in vesicle fusion in alveolar macrophages [39] is consistent with a role in transport from late endosomes to lysosomes. Endobrevin (also known as VAMP8) has been also proposed to have this role, but whereas TI-VAMP probably mediates heterotypic fusions, endobrevin mediates homotypic fusion involving late endosomal vesicles [39­41]. The evidence obtained so far strongly suggests that TI-VAMP might have a pivotal role in cell morphogenesis and remodelling. In fact, TI-VAMP is required for transport to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells and is implicated (together with synaptotagmin VII) in lysosome secretion and membrane repair in fibroblasts [11,33,42,43]. In addition, TI-VAMP is involved in the Ca2C-stimulated degranulation of mastocytic cells and in phagosome sealing in macrophages during phagocytosis, because knockdown of the expression of TIVAMP leads to a reduction in the exocytosis of late endocytic vesicles and an early blockade of pseudopod extension [44,45].

TI-VAMP is also central to neuronal morphogenesis: it concentrates at the tips of growing axons and dendrites, particularly at contact sites, and is required for vesicular transport that mediates neuritogenesis [34,37,46]. Molecular dissection of TI-VAMP and ectopic expression experiments have started to yield insights into the role of its LD in neurite outgrowth; in fact, overexpression of the TI-VAMP LD inhibits neuritogenesis in neuroendocrine cells and both axonal and dendritic outgrowth in hippocampal neurons [17,47]. By contrast, expression of an LD deletion mutant of TI-VAMP increases the formation of SNARE complexes and strongly stimulates neurite outgrowth [17,47]. Evidence on the specific compartmentalization of mammalian TI-VAMP underlines the specificity of v-SNAREs in distinct trafficking pathways; moreover, the enrichment of such longins in cerebral tissues and the specific role of TI-VAMP in neurite outgrowth suggest that longins, rather than brevins, are `developmental VAMPs'. Indeed, VAMP2 is essential for neurotransmitter release but, in contrast to TI-VAMP, it is dispensable for neuronal differentiation [48], as has been confirmed in vivo by VAMP2 knockout mice, which show an almost complete block in neurotransmitter release but apparently normal brain development [49]. Knockout, knockdown and gainof-function experiments in vivo are expected to improve our knowledge of the morphogenetic and developmental role of this longin, which, together with Ykt6, is likely to have important roles in brain function (Box 2). Sec22 and Ykt6 The proteome of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains five R-SNAREs: its two `brevins' [7,8] (Snc1 and Snc2) function in trafficking to the cell surface, both within the endosomal system and between endosomes and the Golgi [50]; Nyv1 is the largest of the five R-SNAREs and the least similar to the other four [51]; and the two longins (Sec22 and Ykt6) are evolutionarily conserved proteins, but only Ykt6 is essential [14]. Structure and function The functional conservation of Ykt6 is reflected in the observations that Ykt6-depleted yeast strains can be complemented by human Ykt6 [14] and that yeast Ykt6 contains the targeting information necessary for its correct localization in mammalian cells and for a specific role in neurons [26] (Box 2). Although Ykt6 and Sec22 are strikingly similar proteins ­ both in their SNARE motifs [10] and in the structures of their LDs [18,19] ­ they differ from one another in several significant aspects. First, Sec22 is anchored via a transmembrane domain (TMD) and functions in both anterograde [52] and retrograde [53] trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. By contrast, Ykt6 is lipid-anchored (Figure 1) and is required for protein trafficking at the Golgi, endosomes and the yeast vacuole [54­56]. Second, the primary function of Sec22 is attributed to its role as a SNARE, whereas Ykt6 is known to have at least one additional non-SNARE function in homotypic vacuolar fusion [27,29,30]. Third, even though Ykt6 and Sec22 have very similar LD structures, it has been proposed that the

Box 2. Longin involvement in neuronal function and brain disease
Longins are involved in exocytotic pathways underlying neuronal functions, as indicated by their localization in the nervous system and their effect on neuronal plasticity. Thus, malfunctions in longins or their binding partners might be involved in genetic pathologies, especially those of a neurological or behavioural origin. TI-VAMP localizes to axons and dendrites in developing cerebral neurons [37,46] and is found at high concentrations in a subset of nerve terminals (particularly the mossy fibres in the CA3 region of the hippocampus) in the adult brain [76]. By contrast, Ykt6 is not widely expressed, but it is highly enriched in neurons from the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex, where it is targeted to a newly identified compartment via its longin domain (LD) [26]. Intracellular targeting of TI-VAMP is also regulated by its LD, which interacts with the d-subunit of the clathrin-coat adaptor complex AP3 (AP3d); in mutant mocha cells, which lack AP3d, the localization of TI-VAMP is shifted from late to early endosomes [22]. Phenotypically, mocha mice show neurological and platelet dysfunctions. Localization of TI-VAMP is also altered in neuroepithelial cells from hyh (hydrocephalus with hop gait) mice that have mutations in the gene encoding the regulator of SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion, a-SNAP [77]. In studies using knockdown by RNA interference, TI-VAMP has been found to mediate both the intracellular transport of L1 ­ an important cell adhesion molecule (CAM) that also guides and stimulates axonal elongation ­ and the formation of L1-CAM-dependent cell contacts [34]. This observation suggests that TI-VAMP might participate in neuronal morphogenesis by delivering CAMs to the plasma membrane. Mutations in L1-CAM are responsible for a wide spectrum of neurological abnormalities, including CRASH syndrome (for corpus callosum hypoplasia, mental retardation, adducted thumbs, spastic paraplegia and hydrocephalus) [78]. Genetic linkage has pinpointed SYBL1 [79], which encodes human TI-VAMP, as a causative candidate gene in bipolar disorder [80,81]. Intriguingly, SNAP-29, a homologue of SNAP-25 (25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein) that has been associated with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [82], physically interacts with TI-VAMP in Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster [22].

LD of Sec22, unlike that of Ykt6, does not fold back and interact with its SNARE motif to adopt a closed conformation [19]. It remains, however, to be established whether Sec22 can adopt such a conformation during its incorporation into coat protein II (COPII)-coated vesicles [21,57], and whether the LD of Sec22 might be involved in interactions with other coat proteins. By contrast, the LD-mediated folded-back conformation of Ykt6 is known to be important for both the stability of the protein in vivo [18] and its correct localization in some but not all cell types [26,58]. In addition, the folded-back conformation of Ykt6 is likely to be necessary to chaperone both the prenyl-modified C terminus of the protein, thereby ensuring the solubility of the lipid-modified cytoplasmically localized form of the protein [26], and its SNARE motif to prevent promiscuous interactions with non-cognate SNAREs. Indeed, a mutation that disrupts the interaction between the LD and SNARE motif of yeast Ykt6 alters both its binding specificity for other SNAREs and the kinetics of SNARE complex assembly in vitro, albeit modestly [18]. The LD is therefore crucial for the function of Ykt6. Because Sec22 is anchored in the membrane bilayer via its TMD, the extent to which Sec22 can move throughout the secretory pathway and participate in multiple transport steps might be restricted by the composition and length of its TMD [59], as well as by signals on Sec22 that direct its efficient recycling from the Golgi to the ER in COPI-coated vesicles [60]. Ykt6 can functionally substitute as a SNARE for Sec22 in ER-to-Golgi traffic in yeast, which perhaps explains why deletion of the SEC22 gene is not lethal in this organism [53]; however, Sec22 cannot functionally substitute for Ykt6 [61]. Overexpression of the R-SNARE Nyv1p can compensate for specific defects in transport steps in ykt6 mutant cells [55], but it remains to be determined whether Sec22 can (conditionally) substitute for any of the trafficking pathways in which Ykt6 is otherwise required. Nonetheless, there seems to be an obligate requirement for these two LD-containing proteins in trafficking between the ER and Golgi compartments: Sec22 is part of the t-SNARE complex (Sed5­Bos1­Sec22) that acts at the

cis-Golgi [62,63], and Ykt6 is the R-SNARE component of the corresponding t-SNARE complex (Sed5­Gos1­Ykt6) that functions at the trans-Golgi [14,62,64,65]. Thus, each Golgi t-SNARE complex contains an LD protein. Whether the LD of Sec22 fulfils a specific role in the control of membrane fusion reactions has not been addressed so far; however, this domain is not required for SNARE complex formation with Sed5, Bos1 and Bet1 in vivo [57] and thus in this case it does not contribute to the specificity of SNARE­SNARE interactions. By contrast, the LD of Ykt6 is likely to be involved in both facilitating and preventing interactions between Ykt6 and other SNAREs in vivo.

Role of post-translational modifications Mammalian Ykt6 is farnesylated and palmitoylated [58]. Both modifications are essential in HeLa cells, possibly because both are required for stable association with the membrane; accordingly, soluble Ykt6 was found to lack a palmitate anchor [58]. Thus, Ykt6 might cycle between a palmitoylated membrane-bound form and a de-palmitoylated but farnesylated and folded-back cytosolic form. Such cycling could regulate the participation of Ykt6 in several fusion reactions and transport steps. By contrast, the cytoplasmic pool of neuronal Ykt6 has been postulated to be palmitoylated and prenylated. This doubly modified form of Ykt6 is crucial to direct the protein to the numerous punctate and presumably membranous structures that are occupied by the wildtype protein and that do not colocalize with any available organelle markers [26,66]. It has been suggested that the folded-back conformation of Ykt6 is necessary to interact with the C-terminal lipids, because substitutions of evolutionarily conserved hydrophobic residues in the LD that are predicted to mediate such interactions alter the localization pattern of the protein [66]. The incongruent data on the lipid-modified status of the cytoplasmic pool of Ykt6 in HeLa and neuronal cells are difficult to reconcile, partly because the experiments described in each case are not directly comparable. But although it is not possible to exclude the possibility that Ykt6 might be differentially modified in different types of cell or species, the

requirement that Ykt6 must be both prenylated and palmitoylated to be fully functional is at least consistent. Not only is Ykt6 itself palmitoylated, but it seems to have a direct role in the palmitoylation of other target proteins. It has been recently shown that Ykt6 mediates acylation of the fusion protein Vac8 at yeast vacuoles [27]. This unexpected feature of Ykt6 could explain why five SNAREs are required for vacuole fusion [30]. It remains to be determined whether Ykt6 has a general role in palmitoylation reactions during intracellular membrane fusion events that are not restricted to the vacuole. Distribution and domain variation Although longins represent the most conserved and widely distributed R-SNAREs in terms of both their LDs and their SNARE motifs [7,10], a comparison of the R-SNARE proteomic complements from model eukaryotes with completely sequenced genomes demonstrates that the longin subfamilies show different distributions and varying numbers of members among taxa (Table 1). The Sec22 and Ykt6 longins have an apparently homogeneous distribution and number of genes, whereas the TI-VAMP longins and brevins are either absent or amplified in their numbers in different taxa. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana lacks brevins and has more than ten TI-VAMPs, whereas S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have brevins but lack TI-VAMP. Protists and metazoans (including Homo sapiens) seem to have only one representative of the TI-VAMP longin subfamily, but some variants, which might result in functional specialization, are generated at the post-transcriptional level (Figure 2). Mammalian cells contain two Sec22 isoforms (termed Sec22a and Sec22c), both of which contain LDs and hydrophobic C termini but lack the SNARE motifs. Both Sec22a and Sec22c localize to the ER and their overexpression leads to the mislocalization of some Golgi SNAREs, suggesting that they might be involved in protein trafficking [67]. Because these isoforms lack a SNARE motif, however, they are unlikely to function as fusion-promoting SNAREs. Additional studies will be necessary to determine the precise role of Sec22a and Sec22c, which in turn might also provide more clues to the role of the LD. Splicing variants have been reported for TI-VAMP, including TI-VAMPc (showing an in-frame central truncation of the LD [22]) and TI-VAMPb (having a truncated

SNARE motif, followed by an extra domain substituting for the TMD; TrEMBL accession code Q9H4A7; http:// www.expasy.org/sprot/). In addition to the longins, nonSNARE proteins containing a longin-like domain can have splice variants [68]; this is not surprising, considering that LDs have profilin-like folds and that alternative splicing of profilins in mammals results in differentially expressed isoforms with distinct biochemical properties [25]. Concluding remarks The SNARE family has remained mostly unchanged in yeast, flies and worms, but has significantly increased in the number of representatives in mammals [6] and plants [9]. These features suggest that multicellular organisms, first, do not have an inherently more complex secretory pathway and, second, use additional SNAREs for the tissue-specific specialization of membrane trafficking [6]. The possibility that longins and brevins might have different roles in differentiation, development and `cellucellular' exocytosis is suggested by their differential distributions among taxa: plants (i.e. organisms with a never-ending development and growth programme) show an increase in the longin family and lack brevins, whereas yeast species lack TI-VAMP longins. Given that the specificity of SNARE compartmentalization and role in neuronal differentiation seems to depend on the LD, this domain as well as LD-like domains might be chief factors in the control of mammalian (including human) brain development and function. As predicted by the SNARE hypothesis, membrane flow patterns are encoded and recapitulated by SNAREs [69],

suggesting that combinatorial interactions and specific asymmetric requirements might generate a sufficient number of complexes to enable a single SNARE complex to act in only one transport step [70]. In addition to specificity, however, spatial and temporal regulation are crucial to ensure correct cellular trafficking. Future studies on such layers of control need to focus on how SNAREs and their regulatory domains, tethering proteins and adaptor complexes are associated in a finely integrated network. Several SNAREs have `regulatory' NTDs that can fold independently [8], and recent evidence indicates that the LD has various functions. Moreover, longins are SNAREs that, at the same time, are related to (and interact with) both domains and proteins of tethering and adaptor complexes; intriguingly, some of these nonSNARE trafficking regulators also adopt LD-like folds. Such a sharing of the LD fold among SNARE and nonSNARE proteins might account for a common basic interaction code in the spatial and temporal control of membrane trafficking, ensuring both the fine-tuning of membrane fusion and the proper subcellular localization and tethering of vesicles to the target membrane. In conclusion, the evidence obtained so far strongly suggests that LDs and longins (as well as LD-like domains and proteins) mediate and regulate fundamental trafficking steps as diverse as vacuolar sorting in yeast and brain function and development in mammals. Determining and comparing further longin and LD-like structures, functions and interactions, as well as knockdown or knockout gene expression experiments, are expected to shed more light on the cellular, developmental and physiopathological processes that are dependent on longins and their LDs.
