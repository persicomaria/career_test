TGF can modulate neuroblastoma (NB) cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. In this study we used a NB cell line (LAN-5) which has been shown to partially respond to TGF and to present high levels of TGF receptor type I and low levels of receptor type II (T RII) on the cell surface. To evaluate the role of T RII in mediating TGF effects, LAN-5 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the human full-length T RII cDNA or with the empty vector pcDNA3. Compared to control CLV3 cells (transfected with empty plasmid) and parental LAN-5 cells, isolated neomycin-resistant clones (CL1 and CL3) expressed higher levels of T RII, had reduced cell growth rate in vitro, and were unable to form tumors in vivo. Furthermore, isolated clones modified their morphology, assuming a terminally differentiated neuronal phenotype. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated a basal increased expression of neuralspecific markers, such as axonal growth-associated protein (GAP43) and neurofilaments (NF200). TGF treatment further increased the synthesis of NF200 and GAP43 in the transfected clones as revealed by Western blot analysis. These data indicate that T RII overexpression potentiates the TGF signal transduction pathway, reverting NB cell neoplastic phenotype with the reduction of proliferation rate and the induction of terminal maturation. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: neuroblastoma cells; TGF ; T RII; neuronal markers.

INTRODUCTION

Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common pediatric tumors and originates from the sympathoadrenal lineage derived from the neural crest [1]. This cancer is uniquely characterized by its potential for

spontaneous resolution by neuronal differentiation in vivo [2]. Recent studies have revealed that growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death of the developing neural crest-derived cells are strongly regulated by growth factors and their receptors [3]. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF ) and members of the TGF superfamily are important factors controlling early embryonic neural development [4, 5]. Direct and indirect evidence suggests that TGF acts on NB cells in culture, inducing differentiation [6]. It has been proposed that TGF mediates both the growth inhibitory response and the differentiation determined by retinoic acid in NB cells, through the upregulation of TGF release as well as the increased expression of TGF receptors [7]. Moreover, TGF treatment induces cell growth inhibition, morphological changes, and neurofilament upregulation in sensitive human NB cell lines [8]. TGF production has also been correlated with the rate of differentiation in neural crest-derived tumors. Indeed, different TGF isotypes, 1, 2, and 3, are expressed by ganglioneuroblastoma, the most mature form of these neuroectodermal tumors, while TGF is usually negative in undifferentiated human neuroblastoma [9]. Thus, TGF appears to be directly involved in neural crest maturation, and so alterations in TGF response could modify both normal cell proliferation and differentiation, inducing deregulated cell cycle control. It has been shown that perturbation of the signal transduction pathway of TGF induces the escape of cells from negative growth control, which may be an important step in the progression of tumors [10, 11]. In line with these results, several types of malignant cells are resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of TGF . This resistance, closely associated with tumor development and progression, could be due either to a loss or reduction in the expression of TGF type I- and II-specific receptors or to alterations in the activated postreceptor signaling pathways [12].

DNA probes were gel purified using the GeneClean method (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA) and random primed with [ 32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 370 MBq/ml; Amersham) at 2 10 8 cpm/ g with the Mega-Prime kit (Amersham). The cDNA probes used were, for TGF type II receptor, EcoRI 4.5-kb fragment of plasmid H2-3FF; for neurofilaments (NF) 200-kDa human pNf36 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD); and for GAP43, EcoRI fragment of TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). The size of transcripts was measured as relative to 18S and 28S rRNA, which were assumed to be 1.8 and 5.4 kb. The integrity and relative abundance of the RNA samples were determined by ethidium bromide staining of the filters. Northern blots were scanned using a densitometer Ultrascan XL (LKB/Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and the intensities of bands were estimated by peak area mm. Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared from subconfluent cultures by lysis in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA in presence of protease inhibitors (0.6 mM PMSF, 10 g/ml leupeptin, 5 g/ml aprotinin, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 200 M Na-vanadate) at 4°C for 30 min. A total of 50 g of proteins/line was separated by 10 or 6% SDS­PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filter. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4) and probed with the following antibodies: anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Clone 12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), monoclonal antibody anti GAP43 (Sigma), and polyclonal anti-200-kDa neurofilaments (RBI­Sigma). The immune complexes were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham). Luciferase assay. LAN-5 cells were seeded at 50 ­ 60% confluence in 24-well-plates and cultured in 15% FCS as described above. Before transfection medium was changed with RPMI 1640 medium without FCS, then cells were cotransfected with p3TPlux and the following plasmids: pCMV5 vector; pCMV5-T RII wt; and pCMV5-K277R, coding for a kinase-inactive T RII receptor (courtesy of Dr. L. Attisano) using Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (GIBCO BRL). The following day medium was changed with RPMI 1640, with 15% FCS, in presence and absence of TGF (10 ng/ml) and luciferase activity was assayed after 24 h, using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Activities were normalized on the basis of -galactosidase activity from pCMV- -gal in all luciferase reported experiments. In Vivo Experiments. Six- to eight-week-old male athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, 22­24 g in body weight, were purchased from Harlan Nossan (Correzzana, Italy). All procedures involving animals and their care were in accord with institutional guidelines in compliance with national laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJL358, December 1, 1987, and National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication No. 85-23, 1985). Each experimental group included five mice, experiments were repeated twice. Tumor cells in exponential phase were harvested from culture, washed once with medium, resuspended in medium without FCS, and injected intramuscularly (im) into the hindleg muscles of nude mice at 6 10 6 cells/mouse. Tumor weights were calculated from caliper measurements according to the method of Geran [17]. Immunocytochemistry. For immunofluorescence analysis, the cells were plated on Labteck chamber slides. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with absolute cold ethanol for 5 min at 20°C, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with monoclonal primary antibodies: anti-vimentin; anti-NF70, NF160, NF200 (neurofilaments); anti-GAP43 (growth-associated protein); anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein); anti-N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule); anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and anti-vimentin (VIM) all purchased from Sigma. The slides were washed extensively with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG F(ab ) 2 fragment (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed with PBS and observed by fluorescence microscope.

nents of the TGF signal transduction pathway have been found in a number of human tumors, and gene complementation or transfections that restore TGF pathway lead generally to a decreased growth of tumors in vivo [13, 14]. In this work we describe for the first time at the molecular level the partial reversion of malignant phenotype of a neural crest-derived tumor cell line, following the strategy of transfecting TGF receptor type II (T RII) into NB cells lacking this receptor. The potential tumor suppressor effects of T RII gene overexpression were studied in a NB cell line (LAN-5) which has been shown to be resistant to the TGF antiproliferative effect and to present low levels of T RII [8]. Transient transfection experiments indicate that increased expression of T RII potentiates LAN-5 cell transcriptional response to endogenous and exogenous TGF . Permanent T RII-transfected clones display a reduction in growth rate and acquire a neurite-bearing phenotype, accompanied by enhanced expression of different neuronal markers. Furthermore, T RII-transfected cells injected into nude mice give tumors smaller in size than those obtained with control cells. Since the effects of TGF family growth factors on neural crest cell differentiation are still unclear, these data indicate that the increase of TGF responsiveness drives this NB cell line toward a differentiated neuronal phenotype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection. The human neuroblastoma cell line LAN-5 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and penicillin­streptomycin [15]. For transfection experiments, about 5 10 6 LAN-5 cells were transfected with 10 g of pcDNA3 plasmid containing the human T RII cDNA, tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), pcDNA3-HAT RII, or empty vector, using the Lipofectamine reagent (GIBCO BRL). Fortyeight hours after transfection, the cells were subcultured into separate dishes and grown in the complete medium with 400 mg/ml neomycin (GIBCO BRL). The colony-forming efficiency was determined by counting resistant clones after 4 weeks of continuous selection. Four neomycin-resistant clones transfected with pcDNA3HAT RII, were isolated and propagated as independent cell lines (CL1, CL2, CL3, and CL4). The CLV3 and CL3A are control clones isolated after transfection with the pcDNA3 empty plasmid. The RIIK2 cell clone, used as control, is a k-ras-transformed rat thyroid cell clone overexpressing the T RII receptor [16]. DNA synthesis assay. Cells (1 10 5) grown in 24-well plates were treated or not with 10 ng/ml TGF for 48 h. TGF used in all experiments is human TGF 1 isoform, purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). DNA synthesis was measured by [ 3H]thymidine incorporation (1 Ci/ml, 40 Ci/mmol; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material, as reported [8]. Each point was assayed in triplicate. RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis. Total RNAs were isolated from cell lines by the guanidium thiocyanate acid­phenol procedure. Total RNA, 10 g/lane, was fractionated on a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham), UV cross-linked, and hybridized following a standard

Evaluation of TGF Signaling as Analyzed by Transient Reporter Expression Assay In this study we used NB cells (LAN-5), previously characterized [8]. To verify whether T RII overexpression was able to restore or enhance TGF signal pathways in these NB cells, transient transfection experiments were performed. To assess functional activity of the transfected T RII gene we analyzed TGF cell response by measuring the induced transcriptional activity of the p3TPlux luciferase reporter plasmid. This is the most commonly used reporter construct to measure TGF responsiveness. Transient transfections of this reporter plasmid in parental LAN-5 cells revealed increased luciferase activity after addition of exogenous TGF . Cotransfection with T RII plasmid showed transcriptional activation of the p3TPLux reporter, even at basal level in presence of calf serum; this response can be further elevated by twofold following addition of exogenous TGF . Moreover, activation of the reporter plasmid is dependent on the dose of T RII DNA plasmid added (results not shown). Instead, cotransfection with a plasmid carrying a mutated inactive form of T RII,

Note. About 5 10 6 LAN-5 cells were transfected with 10 g of pcDNA3 plasmid containing the human T RII cDNA or with the empty plasmid, using Lipofectamine. The colony-forming efficiency was determined by counting neomycin-resistant clones after 4 weeks of continuous selection. The reported values and their means refer to three separate transfection experiments.

T RII K277R, reduced luciferase activity, acting as dominant negative [18] (Fig. 1). These data support the idea that the NB cells used have functional TGF pathways and that T RII overexpression by transient transfection enhances TGF pathway activation. Effects of Permanent Expression of T RII in LAN-5 Cells To verify whether increased permanent expression of T RII, enhancing TGF responsiveness, could change NB cell phenotype and cell behavior, subconfluent cultures of LAN-5 cells were transfected either with the empty plasmid (pcDNA3) or with the expression vector carrying the human T RII cDNA tagged with the influenza virus HA, pcDNA3-HA T RII. Table 1 illustrates the cloning efficiency of transfected cells obtained from three independent transfection experiments. A remarkable difference between T RII- and pcDNA3-transfected NB cells in the colony-forming efficiency was observed after 4 weeks of growth in selective medium. Moreover, the T RII-transfected colonies had a lower number of cells than those transfected with the empty vector. After 4 weeks in selective medium, the average number of cells per colony was 25.6 29 for T RII-transfected NB clones and 67.3 105 for pcDNA3 and after 6 weeks 29.7 25 pcDNA3HAT RII and 100 cells per colony for pcDNA3 (data obtained from transfection experiment 3). Two neomycin-resistant colonies, CL3A and CLV3, were isolated and propagated from pcDNA3-transfected NB cells, and four colonies, clones CL1, CL2, CL3, and CL4, were isolated from T RII transfections. Analysis of T RII Expression in T RII-Transfected Clones The expression of the T RII receptor in NB cell clones was analyzed by Northern and Western blot. In

epithelioid cells, as demonstrated by phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 3A). All transfected clones acquired a different morphology from the parental cells and resembled mature neural cells; the cells exhibited pronounced neurite outgrowth and aggregation, reminiscent of nerve ganglia formation (Figs. 3B and 3C). Moreover, the isolated clones were very difficult to maintain in culture. They grew slowly with an elevated doubling time compared to the LAN-5 parental cells

(B) Western blot analysis of TGF type II receptor expression in LAN-5 cells, transfected clones CL1 and CL3, and control CLV3 clone. Cell lysates (50 g/lane) were separated in 10% SDS­PAGE. Blot was hybridized with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies.

Fig. 2A, in addition to the band of 5.5 kb representing the endogenous T RII mRNA, a new transcript of the expected size (1.8 kb) can be seen in total RNA isolated from neomycin-resistant clones CL1 and CL3: this transcript is absent in the parental LAN-5 total RNA and in the control CL3A and CLV3 clones. As a positive control we used a cell line (RIIK2 cell clone) transfected with a T RII expression vector and shown to overexpress this gene after ZnCl 2 treatment [16]. Western blot analysis showed elevated expression of this receptor in the isolated transfected clones CL1, CL2, CL3, and CL4; the highest levels of T RII were found in CL1 and CL3 clones, as shown in Fig. 2B. The anti-HA antibody used did not detect this receptor either in LAN-5 cells or in CLV3 cells. The anti-HA antibody used detected T RII as multiple bands in the 70 kDa region; these multiple T RII forms probably represent products of heterogeneous glycosylation, as previously reported by Lin et al. [19]. The CL1 and CL3 clones were then used for the following experiments. In Vitro and in Vivo Growth Properties of T RIITransfected Clones The morphologies of CLV3 and parental LAN-5 cells were similar, both showing strongly adherent rounded

FIG. 4. (A) DNA synthesis assay of LAN-5 and CL1, CL3, and CLV3 clones. Cells (1 10 5) grown in 24-well plates as described in Materials and Methods were treated or not with 10 ng/ml TGF for 48 h.

and presented loss of adhesiveness to the plastic dishes. Figure 4A shows a DNA synthesis assay in the presence and absence of 10 ng/ml TGF . A 70% reduction in thymidine cell uptake was detected in CL1 and CL3 cell clones, compared to parental LAN-5. However, TGF treatment was unable to further reduce [ 3H]thymidine uptake of the transfected clones. It was observed that TGF treatment was unable to induce cell death by apoptosis in the clones and in NB parental cells, even in higher doses, as controlled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated DNA labeling (TUNEL technique, data not shown). Since these data obtained in vitro suggested that the T RII overexpression produced a reduction in growth rate, we tested the in vivo behavior of the transfected clones. For this purpose, nude mice were injected im with CLV3 and with CL1 and CL3 cells at 6 10 6 cells/mouse. Up to 14 days the sizes of the tumors observed were similar in all clones, while in the subsequent period a remarkable difference in tumor growth was noted. As shown in Fig. 4B, on day 14 after tumor implantation of control CLV3 cells, a mean tumor weight of 213 mg was observed. This value was similar to the mean tumor weight of mice injected with CL1 and CL3 cells (182 and 176 mg, respectively). On

day 30, however, the tumor mass of the control CLV3 was as much as 1275 mg, while the weight of the tumors originating from CL1 and CL3 clones was only 265 and 248 mg, respectively. These results indicate that the overexpression of T RII in LAN-5 cells is able to reduce the in vivo tumor growth. Differentiation Properties of T RII-Transfected Clones To assess the new phenotype acquired by the transfected clones, the expression of two typical neuronal markers NF200 and GAP43 was evaluated by immunofluorescence and Northern blot. The immunofluorescence staining of NF200 and GAP 43 was increased in the T RII-transfected clones compared to CLV3 cells (Figs. 5A and 6A). To evaluate the level of expression of NF200 and GAP43 mRNAs in the transfected clones with respect to control cell line Northern blot analysis was performed. Both clones CL1 and CL3 showed an approximately threefold increase in NF200 and GAP43 mRNA compared to LAN-5 cells, as evaluated by densitometric scanning of the blot (Figs. 5B and 6B). To molecularly quantify the enhanced GAP43 and NF200 protein expression following TGF treatment, Western blot analysis was performed. An evident ele-

vated expression of NF200 was found in the CL1 clone, with respect to control clone, and in both transfected clones the addition of exogenous TGF enhanced neurofilament expression (Fig. 5C). The anti-GAP43 antibody used in these experiments was unable to reveal the low levels of protein in control LAN-5 (not shown) and CLV3 cells (Fig. 6C). Instead, both CL1 and CL3 clones expressed GAP43, which increased by about twofold after TGF treatment.
DISCUSSION

TGF growth factors are multifunctional cytokines which regulate cell growth, differentiation, and function [20] and recent evidence suggests that they constitute part of an important tumor suppressor pathway [12]. In the present study, the anti-oncogenic potential of the T RII gene was tested in an in vitro system of NB cells, and the results indicate that overexpression of this receptor reduces the growth and tumorigenicity of LAN-5 cells in nude mice and induces a differentiated neuronal phenotype.

Transfection experiments showed that T RII expression in NB cells inhibited colony formation by up to 80%, compared to the empty vector-transfected cells. Moreover, during selection of T RII-transfectants single differentiated NB cells were noticed, the colonies were smaller in size than the pcDNA3 colonies and frequently failed to proliferate. All these observations suggest a cell growth suppression effect of T RII, though at present we cannot exclude the possibility that extremely high levels of T RII expression in NB cells might be apoptotic or toxic [21, 22]. However, experiments performed in this and in previous works indicate that TGF acts as an inhibitory agent and does not induce apoptosis in the NB cell lines analyzed [7, 8]. The inhibitory effect of T RII on cell growth was clearly evident in the DNA synthesis assays, in which the transfected clones tested presented a 70% decrease in thymidine uptake compared to parental LAN-5 and CLV3 control cells. The elevated expression of functional T RII receptor probably reduced cell prolifera-

tion rate by increasing NB cell sensitivity to autocrine and paracrine TGF present in the serum added to the culture medium. Data obtained by transient T RII transfection support this hypothesis, revealing a constitutive basal elevated transcriptional activation of the reporter plasmid seen in the absence of additional exogenous ligand. In line with these results, in vivo cell growth in nude mice was also markedly reduced. In fact all mice inoculated with the transfected NB cell clones (CL1, CL3) did not develop tumors beyond 1 month from the inoculation. In agreement with previously published studies, these data suggest that T RII receptor could act also on NB cells as a tumor suppressor gene [23­25], since its ectopic expression decreases cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Work is now in progress to ascertain whether genetic alterations or reduction in T RII gene expression can also be detected in human neuroblastoma tumors. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that in some NB human tumors alterations of SMAD4/DPC4 and

SMAD2 gene expression are present, suggesting an impairment of the TGF pathway [26, 27]. T RII-induced cell growth suppression could be due to the activation of a neuronal differentiation-specific pathway. In fact, in most NB cell lines induced to differentiate in vitro by a variety of biological agents, the morphological neural differentiation correlated with reduced cell growth [28]. Moreover, in our clones a stronger tendency to form tight cell clumps compared to the parental cells was observed, which suggests that T RII overexpression might lead to an increase in homotypic adhesiveness in LAN-5 cells, certainly due to a modification of adhesion molecules on the NB cell surface. Immunofluorescence and molecular analysis of specific neuronal markers confirms the induction of morphological neural maturation. The observed immunofluorescence pattern of transfected clones in comparison with clone CLV3 is indicative of a more mature phenotype of neuroblastoma toward the neuronal pathway: the transfectants showed an increase in NF160/

Instead, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, which usually characterizes a Schwannic feature of neuroblastoma [29], was not present either in parental cells or in the transfected clones. Moreover, VIM expression, which is usually downregulated during neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells [30], was found to be reduced in the transfected clones (results not shown). The acquisition of this phenotype appears to be due to the basal increased activation of the TGF pathways in the T RII-transfected clones, which can be further potentiated by addition of exogenous ligand. In fact T RII-overexpressing clones showed an evident increased expression of NF200 and GAP43 after TGF treatment compared to control NB cells. TGF treatment (10 ng/ml for 48 h) was unable to further reduce the DNA synthesis of CL1 and CL3 clones, while the same treatment increased the expression of neuronal markers, as revealed by Western blot. These data suggest that TGF probably acts on these NB cells through at least two different pathways and separately controls cell proliferation and differentiation. In fact, growth inhibition and extracellular matrix protein induction can occur independently in response to exogenous TGF , as observed in colon carcinoma [31] and in mammary epithelial cells [32]. Moreover, iodide uptake and cell proliferation appear to be regulated in different ways in thyroid differentiated cells [33]. Alternatively, a dose-related effect of the level of expression of these receptors might determine the induction of these different biological responses. In conclusion, our data suggest that diminished expression of T RII in NB cells may enhance the malignant phenotype of these cells. Several reports have indicated a role for diminished or altered TGF receptors in the induction and maintenance of the malignant phenotype of different types of human cancer and this is the first report on a neural crest-derived tumor cell line. The described transfections with T RII, enhancing TGF response of NB cells, induce a more differentiated neuronal phenotype associated with reduced growth in vitro and in vivo; thus, this gene could be considered a tumor suppressor gene for neuroblastoma cells.
