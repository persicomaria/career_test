Chromodomains are methylated histone binding modules that have been widely studied. Interestingly, some chromodomains are reported to bind to RNA and/or DNA, although the molecular basis of their RNA/DNA interactions has not been solved. Here we propose a novel binding mode for chromodomain­RNA interactions. Essential Sas-related acetyltransferase 1 (Esa1) contains a presumed chromodomain in addition to a histone acetyltransferase domain. We initially determined the solution structure of the Esa1 presumed chromodomain and showed it to consist of a well-folded structure containing a five-stranded -barrel similar to the tudor domain rather than the canonical chromodomain. Furthermore, the domain showed no RNA/DNA binding ability. Because the N-terminus of the protein forms a helical turn, we prepared an N-terminally extended construct, which we surprisingly found to bind to poly(U) and to be critical for in vivo function. This extended protein contains an additional -sheet that acts as a knot for the tudor domain and binds to oligo(U) and oligo(C) with greater affinity compared with other oligo-RNAs and DNAs examined thus far. The knot does not cause a global change in the core structure but induces a well-defined loop in the tudor domain itself, which is responsible for RNA binding. We made 47 point mutants in an esa1 mutant gene in yeast in which amino acids of the Esa1 knotted tudor domain were substituted to alanine residues and their functional abilities were examined. Interestingly, the knotted tudor domain mutations that were lethal to the yeast lost poly(U) binding ability. Amino acids that are related to RNA interaction sites, as revealed by both NMR and affinity binding experiments, are found to be important in vivo. These findings are the first demonstration of how the novel structure of the knotted tudor domain impacts on RNA binding and how this influences in vivo function.

Introduction
Modifications of histones, such as acetylation and methylation, are critical for gene regulation. 1­3 Chromodomains are methylated histone binding modules that have been widely studied.4­7 The chromodomain was originally identified as a homologous motif in heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1),8,9 polycomb protein (PC),10 and many other chromatin-related proteins.11,12 Single chromodomains from HP1 and PC and double chromodomains from human CHD1 bind to methylated lysine histone

988 tails (H3 K9, K27, and K4), and the binding modes of these chromodomains are well established.8­10,13 The canonical chromodomain structure in HP1 and PC consists of a three-stranded -sheet with a Cterminal  helix. Chromodomain is a member of the tudor domain "royal family," which contains the tudor, PWWP, and MBT domains, all of which form a four-stranded -barrel instead of a combination of a core three-stranded -sheet and a C-terminal long  helix found in the canonical chromodomain14 and interact with methylated histone tail or the other proteins.15­20 However, chromodomains from Drosophila histone acetyltransferase (HAT; MOF), Drosophila malespecific lethal protein (MSL-3), Drosophila Mi-2, and mouse polycomb homologue (Cbx7) were reported to bind to RNA and/or DNA in vitro and in vivo.21­23 Although their RNA binding is shown to be important for several biological systems, 24 the mechanism of binding is not yet elucidated. To understand the molecular basis of RNA binding and to further investigate the roles of chromodomains, we attempted to determine the structure of the presumed chromodomain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae essential Sas-related acetyltransferase 1 (Esa1) and to identify the domain and residues required for RNA binding. We selected Esa1 because genetic assay systems are well established in yeast. Esa1, containing a chromodomain in its N-terminus, is a catalytic subunit of the nucleosomal acetyltransferase of histone H4 (NuA4) complex25,26 and acetylates lysine residues of histones H4 and H2A.27,28 It is the only essential HAT in yeast,27,28 necessary for cell division, and known to be involved in a variety of nuclear processes, such as DNA double-strand break repair,29 transcription initiation and elongation,30,31 transcriptional silencing,32 and regulation of progress through the cell cycle.27 It is also reported that

its chromodomain is required for HAT activity of piccolo NuA4.33

Results
RNA binding activities of short and long Esa1 presumed chromodomain constructs So far, the Esa1 chromodomain is predicted as 33­ 86 amino acids by SMART34; the secondary structural prediction by JPred35 defined the structural domain in its 20­74 amino acids. Initially, we prepared an Esa1 presumed chromodomain construct consisting of amino acids 17­89 (Fig. 1a and b). By using poly(U)­ and poly(A)­Sepharose columns as well as immobilized native and denatured DNAcellulose columns, we found that the construct had no RNA or DNA binding ability (Fig. 1c). As shown subsequently, the N-terminus of this chromodomain took up a specific conformation. We therefore prepared a longer construct consisting of amino acids 1­89 (Fig. 1a and b). This long construct was surprisingly found to bind to poly(U) significantly and to native DNA weakly but not to poly(A) or denatured DNA (Fig. 1d). NMR structures of the long and short constructs including the Esa1 presumed chromodomain To reveal the origin of the different RNA binding abilities of the long and short constructs including the putative chromodomain of Esa1, we determined their structures by a conventional multidimensional heteronuclear NMR method using 15N-labeled and 15 N,13C-labeled proteins. In the 1H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of the long construct, almost all signals were

With the use of input consisting of the chemical shift lists from the sequence-specific assignments and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra, CYANA36,37 yielded a total of 3069 assigned NOE cross-peaks in cycle 7 for the long one and a total of 1915 assigned NOE cross-peaks in cycle 7 for the short one. These yielded 1684 and 818 meaningful NOE upper distance limits for the long and short ones, respectively, as input for the final structure calculation. The 20 lowest energy structures give an average CYANA target function of 0.41 Å for the long one and that of 0.48 Å for the short one (Figs. 2a and 3a). The statistics of the structures for the long and short constructs are summarized in Table 1. The averaged pairwise RMSDs of the long construct were 0.27 ± 0.08 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.81 ± 0.09 Å for all heavy atoms in the regions of residues 8­82. The averaged

pairwise RMSDs of the short construct were 0.67 ± 0.10 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.23 ± 0.11 Å for all heavy atoms in the regions of residues 17­54 and 64­75. PROCHECK Ramachandran plots for the long and short constructs display 80.2% and 77.4% of residues in the most favored regions and 19.8% and 22.6% of residues in additional allowed regions, respectively. Structural differences between the two tudor domains are observed. Figures 2b and 3b show that both Esa1 constructs contain a very similar barrel consisting of five  strands, S1 (26­31 amino acids), S2 (34­44 amino acids), S3 (51­56 amino acids), S4 (65­68 amino acids), and S5 (72­73 amino acids), which is in contrast to the canonical chromodomain that consists of three  strands with a C-terminal  helix8­10,14 (Fig. 1b). Although both proteins contain two well-defined helical turns, Ht1 (amino acids 18­20) and Ht3 (amino acids 69­ 71), the longer protein has another well-defined helical turn, Ht2 (amino acids 61­63) (Fig. 3a and b).

In the shorter protein, the corresponding region has an ill-defined structure (Fig. 2a). With the use of the DALI program,38 the overall architectures of the Esa1 chromodomains from both proteins were identified as being part of the tudor domain family, resembling the tudor domain of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein 115,16 with a Z score of 5.8. However, the long construct contains an additional -sheet formed by an N-terminal  strand, S0 (11­13 amino acids), and a C-terminal  strand, S6 (78­80 amino acids), which acts as a knot for the tudor domain. Here we designate the short and long proteins as the short and knotted tudor domains, respectively, because in the long construct, the core tudor domain consisting of a five-stranded -barrel seems to be knotted by the N-terminal and C-terminal  strands. This is well related to the chemical shift changes between long and short constructs; the significant chemical shift changes for amide 15N­1H signals were observed in the regions of amino acids 17­21 and 76­80 (data not shown). Genetic activity of the Esa1 knotted tudor domain To establish the physiological importance of the N-terminus of the knotted tudor domain of Esa1

in vivo, we tested the phenotypes of a mutant lacking the N-terminal region in a variety of systems, including suppression of Ty (Spt) phenotype assay39 and measurements of sensitivity to 6azauracil (6AU),40 hydroxyurea (HU),41 and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)42 (Fig. 4a). We found that this N mutant is moderately sensitive to MMS, which induces double-strand breaks of DNA (Fig. 4b). This result indicates that the N-terminus of the Esa1 knotted tudor domain is functional in vivo. This moderateness of the phenotypic changes could be interpreted as the N mutant of the tudor domain of Esa1 forms a structure practically similar with the wild type in the context of the NuA4 complexes. Comparison of the structures between the Esa1 knotted and short tudor domains Both short and knotted tudor domains are maintained by a hydrophobic core containing Val18, Ile21, Val29, Ala38, Ile40, Ile43, Phe52, Val54, Ile67, and Ile72 (Fig. 5a and b). Both hydrophobic cores can be well superimposed; therefore, even in the short tudor domain, the N-terminal Val18 and Ile21 participate in the hydrophobic core stabilizing the helical turn Ht1 (Fig. 5a).

tudor domain, additional hydrophobic amino acids, Ile11, Ile15, Ile22, Tyr56, Tyr59, Leu63, Val78, and Tyr80, pack into the hydrophobic core of the short tudor domain (Fig. 5b). In the knotted tudor domain, the extra core packed by the N- and C-terminal  strands stabilizes the core formed by strands S1­S5, causing the stabilization of the loop between S3 and S4 and the formation of the helical turn Ht2. The heteronuclear {1H}­15N NOE experiments with both tudor domains showed that most of the heteronuclear NOE values of the knotted tudor domain are higher than those of the short protein. This suggests that the backbone of the short domain is on the whole more flexible than the corresponding part of the knotted domain (Fig. 5c). In the knotted tudor domain, the additional -sheet formed by S0 and S6 seems to suppress the flexibility of the hydrophobic core maintained by Val54, Tyr56, Leu63, Ile67, Ile72, Val78, and Tyr80, which causes the stabilization of the loop conformation between S3 and S4. However, the knot seems to induce backbone flexibility in amino acids Ile40, Leu41, and Asn44 on the S2 strand and amino acids Lys51 and Tyr53 on the S3 strand. In vitro and in vivo functions of the Esa1 knotted tudor domain We examined the ability of the short and knotted tudor domains to bind to DNA and RNA oligonucleotides as well as to methylated histone peptides using NMR. Although no change in the 1H­15N

HSQC two-dimensional (2D) spectra of either tudor domain could be observed upon addition of methylated histone peptides (Supplementary Table), the spectrum of the knotted tudor domain changed significantly upon addition of the oligoribonucleotides 16mer(U) and 16mer(C) (Fig. 6a and b; Table 2). Chemical shift changes were observed for amide protons of Thr45, Lys61, Arg62, Leu63, and Leu83 and the Trp66 H proton (Fig. 6c and d); in the 1H­13C HSQC spectrum, changes were also observed for the aromatic protons of Tyr53 and Trp66 (Fig. 6e). The Kd values are estimated to be 28 M for 16mer(U) and 21 M for 16mer(C) (Fig. 6f and g). These shifted residues map onto the surface of the S3 and S4 strand sides (Fig. 8a). With other oligonucleotides examined thus far, binding affinities of the order of 3­10 times weaker have been obtained. We investigated whether these residues are also functional in vivo. We constructed 47 alaninesubstituted mutants to identify biologically important residues of the knotted tudor domain. Because the Esa1 gene is essential, we first checked the viability of mutants using a URA3-based plasmid shuffle system. The Tyr56Ala, Asn60Ala, and Arg62Ala mutations induced lethality in vivo, and the Tyr53Ala and Trp66Ala mutations seemed to produce severe growth defects (Fig. 7a). However, there was only weak or almost no growth defect observed with the other 42 mutations (data not shown). Next, we examined the in vitro RNA binding abilities of the alanine-substituted mutants of the knotted tudor domain, which showed lethality or

Fig. 4. Genetic activities of the Esa1 knotted tudor domain. (a) Schematic representation of Spt assay. Insertion of Ty or  sequence into the 5 region of a gene often abolishes or reduces transcription of the adjacent gene. Such inhibition is probably due to the strong transcription signals within the Ty or  sequence interfering with those of the adjacent gene. Certain insertional mutations, located in the 5 or upstream region of HIS4, abolish expression of the gene, resulting in His auxotrophy. Selection for the Spt- phenotype in these strains therefore selects for His+ revertants. In all of the Spt mutants examined, normal transcription of the adjacent gene was restored. Therefore, it was deduced that a common role for the SPT gene product is to affect promoter function such that transcription from Ty or  increases and transcription from the adjacent gene decreases. In the present assay system, the  sequence is inserted into the 5 noncoding region of HIS4.39 (b) Effect of deletion of the N-terminal region of the Esa1 knotted tudor domain on in vivo function.

severe growth defects. Strikingly, the Tyr53Ala, Tyr56Ala, Asn60Ala, and Arg62Ala mutations abolish the RNA binding ability completely and the Trp66Ala mutation decreases binding (Fig. 7b). Thus, the results demonstrate a strong correlation between viability of the mutants in yeast and in vitro RNA binding. Furthermore, we also detected phenotypic changes of some mutants (Leu41Ala, Tyr53Ala, His55Ala, Tyr59Ala, Leu63Ala, Asp64Ala, Glu65Ala, Typ66Ala, Ile67Ala, and Ile72Ala) with respect to the Spt phenotype and sensitivities to 6AU, HU, and MMS (Fig. 7c). We used the W28A mutant as a negative control. These results suggest that the interaction between the knotted tudor domain and RNA/DNA found in the 2D HSQC spectrum in vitro (Fig. 8a­c) could be critical for in vivo RNA binding and a variety of cellular processes.

RNA binding and in vivo functions. This is the first report to reveal the strong correlation between RNA binding and in vivo function of the presumed chromodomain of Esa1. In future research, it is important that we identify the RNA to which the Esa1 knotted tudor domain binds in vivo and that we characterize the structural and functional relationships between them. Because the chromodomain family has functional and structural polymorphism,4,12,44 further studies on the shared characteristics and diversity of this domain family will provide the field of chromatin research with important information about the complexity of chromatin regulation and the evolution of the chromatin system.

We have determined the structure of the novel knotted tudor domain of Esa1, which is required for binding to RNA. We have further demonstrated that the knot influences the loop conformation of Ht2, which is located at the side opposite to the knot, and that stabilization of Ht2 is essential for

The column was washed with 20 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1.5 M NaCl, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, and 30 mM imidazole buffer and eluted with a linear gradient from 30 to 500 mM imidazole. The sample was further purified by gel-filtration column (Superdex75 PG, GE Healthcare UK Limited) chromatography in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 M NaCl, and 5 mM mercaptoethanol buffer. With the use of PelliconXL Ultracel-5 PLCCC (MILLIPORE) concentrators, the buffer was changed to 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer (KPB; pH 6.8). The sample was digested with thrombin for 12 h at room temperature. The sample was loaded onto a nickel/nitrilotriacetic acid/agarose (Qiagen) column and HiTrap Benzamidine FF (GE Healthcare UK Limited) column to remove the His6 tag and thrombin protease. For NMR measurements, the purified protein was concentrated to about 0.35 mM for the long construct and 0.1 mM for the short construct and the buffer was changed to 200 mM KPB (pH 6.8), 5 mM d10-DTT, and 5% (v/v) or 100% 2H2O. We performed all experiments with the long construct with a non-His-tagged sample. Because of the poor solubility of the short construct, we used a His-tagged sample for structural determination, but in NMR titration and affinity binding experiments with the short construct, the non-His-tagged sample was used. Both His-tagged

and non-His-tagged short constructs showed almost identical 1H­15N HSQC spectra (data not shown). NMR spectroscopy The NMR experiments were performed at 22 °C on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer, an 800-MHz spectrometer with a 5-mm triple-resonance pulsed-field gradient cryoprobe, and a Varian Inova 900-MHz spectrometer with a 5-mm triple-resonance pulsed-field gradient probe. The chemical shifts were referenced to the chemical shift of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate.

of HN, N, CO, C, and C, a prediction of  and  backbone torsion angles using TALOS,47 and 3D HNHA spectra. For 3 JHNH values N 7 Hz, the  angle was assumed to be between -140° and -100°. Hydrogen bond restraints were obtained from the hydrogen­deuterium exchange experiments. CYANA was used to compute seven cycles, each

with 600 structures. Each conformer was subjected to 10,000 steps of torsion angle dynamics per cycle. Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures were selected to represent the Esa1 tudor domain. Ramachandran plot statistics for the structures were calculated using PROCHECK-NMR.48 The statistics of the structures are summarized in Table 1.

Knotted Tudor Domain The structures were visualized by using MOLMOL49 and PyMOL§. Purification of mutant proteins All Esa1 tudor domain mutants were generated from the pET-52-based expression vector with an engineered HRV3C protease-cleavable N-terminal GST (glutathione S-transferase) tag. The proteins were purified using GSTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare UK Limited) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) including 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 5 mM DTT buffer, and on-column cleavage by HRV3C protease (Invitrogen). The proteins were further purified using Superdex75 PG gelfiltration chromatography in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) containing 1 M NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 5 mM DTT buffer. Oligonucleotide titration experiments DNA oligomers and RNA oligomers were synthesized by SIGMA Genosys and Hokkaido System Science, respectively. The oligonucleotide titration experiments were performed and monitored by a series of 2D 1H­15N HSQC spectra and 1H­13C HSQC spectra. NMR titration studies were performed in 20 mM KPB (pH 6.8) containing 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM d10-DTT, and 5% (v/v) 2H2O at 22 °C. The oligonucleotide was titrated with increasing molar ratios into a 100 M sample of the 15N-labeled or 15N,13Clabeled Esa1. Chemical shift changes were calculated as  = {(1H)2 + (15N/5)2}1/2. The dissociation constant (Kd) value was calculated from NMR titration data using the following equation:45 Dy ¼ Dymax ð½Lt þ ½Pt þ Kd À fð½Lt þ ½Pt þ Kd Þ2 À ð4½Lt ½Pt Þg1=2 Þ=ð2½Pt Þ ð1Þ where max is the maximal change in chemical shift, [P]t is the total concentration of the Esa1 tudor domain, and [L]t is the total concentration of the oligonucleotide. Heteronuclear steady-state {1H}­15N NOE experiments The heteronuclear steady-state {1H}­15N NOE values were obtained from the ratios of peak intensities in the saturated spectrum to those in the unsaturated spectrum during the 5.0-s recycle delay.45,50 Errors were estimated by evaluating the standard deviation of the NOE, NOE, as follows: jNOE =NOE ¼ ððjISAT =ISAT Þ2 þ ðjIUNSAT =IUNSAT Þ2 Þ1=2 where ISAT and IUNSAT are the standard deviations of the noise in the spectra.50 In vitro nucleic acid binding assay Columns of poly(U)­Sepharose 4B, poly(A)­Sepharose 4B, immobilized native calf thymus DNA-cellulose, and immobilized denatured calf thymus DNA-cellulose (GE Healthcare UK Limited) with a volume of 1.5 mL were

999
prepared, and a 1-mL sample containing 10 M target protein was applied on the column and then washed with 15 mL of 20 mM KPB (pH 6.8) containing 10 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT. The flow-through sample was recovered. The bound sample was then eluted with a linear gradient buffer from 10 mM to 1 M NaCl. Each of the flow-through and bound samples was concentrated to 500 L. Five microliters of the input, flow-through, and bound samples was analyzed by 17.5% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie brilliant blue. Plasmid and mutagenesis for yeast genetics pRS315-ESA1 and pRS316-ESA1 were constructed by inserting the ESA1 genomic region (from 600 bp upstream of the start codon to 600 bp downstream of the stop codon) into pRS315 [LEU2 CEN ARS] and pRS316 [URA3 CEN ARS], respectively. For the construction of point mutants of ESA1, we introduced alanine substitutions using a sitedirected mutagenesis method into the ESA1 gene in pRS315-ESA1. Yeast strains and assay FY119 (MAT his4­912 lys2­128 leu2 1 ura3­52 trp163) was used as a parent strain for esa1 mutants. Disruption of ESA1 was performed by one-step gene replacement selecting for Candida TRP1. This deletion was rescued with pRS316-ESA1. We then transformed it with plasmids carrying the mutant ESA1 genes or the corresponding wild-type gene as a control. Threefold serial dilutions of the resultant transformants were spotted onto plates containing 0.1% of 5-fluoroorotic acid to check their viability. Media All yeast strains were cultured with synthetic complete medium, which contained 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (w/v) bacto agar, supplemented with appropriate amino acids. We utilized media without histidine51 and with 6AU,40 HU,41 and MMS42 to check the Spt phenotype and sensitivities to 6AU, HU, and MMS, respectively. Data Bank accession codes The PDB accession codes are 2RNZ for the short tudor domain of Esa1 and 2RO0 for the knotted tudor domain of Esa1. The BioMagResBank accession numbers are 11033 for the short tudor domain of Esa1 and 11032 for the knotted tudor domain of Esa1.
