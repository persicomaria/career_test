A new structural class of anilide tertiary carbinol potassium channel openers (PCOs) is described.

Potassium channels are known to play a key role in controlling cellular excitability. As the predominant charge carrying ion channel in resting cells, potassium channels are major contributors to the resting cell potential. They are also involved in action potential duration, after-hyperpolarixation. and thus in events related to the rate of firing of an action potential. Modulation of these factors is important in the control cellular excitability.t

A number of structurally diverse agents have been described that function by opening potassium channels, primarily ATP-sensitive potassium channels, in a number of different tissues and cell types.1 The discovery of the PC0 cromakalim (1),2*3 and the subsequent realization that pinacidil, (2) also functioned as a hypotensive agent by virtue of its PC0 properties led to an explosion of interest in potassium channels.4 Other structurally distinct PCOs have also been described. Therapeutic applications of PCOs in hypotension and in asthma are being explored by a number of companies. incontinence (UJ). An investigation of a sub-set of anti-andmgen compounds possessing unwanted hypotensive activity resulted in the discovery of a new structural class of potassium channel openers. * This series is represented by the tpary carbiiol3 which has been found to be ca. eight fold more potent than the racemic cromakalim, (1) on guineapig detrusor (bladder) strip mildly depolarized with 15mM KC1.6 On vascular tissue (guinea-pig portal vein) 3 was found to be ca. seven times more potent than 1 as shown in Table 1. Our interest has been primarily in the area of urinary urge

Table 1. Although 3 is achiral we have also investigated compounds such as 4 and have found that the PC0 activity largely resides in the S enantiomer 5 as shown in Table 2.

Table 2. The PC0 activity of this series has been confirmed in a number of supporting studies. Thus the relaxant effects of 5 on guinea-pig detrusor are reversed by the specific KATP blocker, glibenclamide (pA2 = 7.2). Additionally the relaxant activity of 5 under highly depolarized conditions (using 8OmM KCl) is very weak (IC5o = cu. 26OltM). We have also demonstrated that 5 will increase the rate of efflux of gaRb+ (A K+ surrogate) from guinea-pig detrusor smooth muscle. A 40.0 f 4.5% maximum increase in the efflux rate constant was obtained with 54.6pM of 5 using guinea pig detrusor (30pM cromakalim caused a 47.2 +I 1.6% increase). It is of interest to note that 3 has a pKa of cu. 7.5 making it cu. 50% ionized at a physiological pH of 7.4. Glibenclamide has a similar pKa and this has been exploited to help understand whether this agent binds to an extracellular, intracellular, or intramembrane site.* Conceivably similar experiments could be performed with 3 or related ionized PCOs to help locate the interaction site of these PCGs. To our knowledge 3 is the first reported example of a PC0 to be ionized to a significant degree at physiological PH. In summary we report a new structural class of potent potassium channel openers that interact with the KATZ channel in guinea-pig detrusor smooth muscle. References and Notes
