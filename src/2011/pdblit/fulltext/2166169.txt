Papain is a sulfhydryl protease from the latex of the papaya fruit. Its molecules consist of one polypeptide chain with 212 amino acid residues. The chain is folded into two domains with the active site in a groove between the domains. We have refined the crystal structure of papain, in which the sulfhydryl group was oxidized, by a restrained least-squares procedure at 1.65 A to an R-factor of 16.1%. The estimated accuracy in the atomic co-ordinates is 0.1 A, except for disordered atoms. All cp/$ angles for non-glycine residues are found within the outer limit boundary of a Ramachandran plot and this provides another check on the quality of the model. In the a-helical parts of the structure, the C=O bonds are directed more away from the helix axis than in a classical cc-helix, leading to somewhat longer hydrogen bonds, 2.98 A, compared to 2.89 A. The hydrogenbonding parameters and conformational angles in the anti-parallel /?-sheet structure show a large diversity. Hydrogen bonds in the core of the sheet are generally shorter than those at the more twisted ends. The average value is 2.91 A. The hydrogen bond distance Ni+ 3-Oi in turns is relatively long and the geometry is far from linear. Hydrogen bond formation, therefore. is perhaps not an essential prerequisite for turn formation. Although the crystallization medium is 62% (w/w) methanol in water, only 29 out of 224 solvent molecules can be regarded with any certainty as methanol molecules. The water molecules play an important role in maintaining structural stability. This is specially true for internal water. Twenty-one water molecules are located in contact areas between adjacent papain molecules. It seems as if the enzyme is trapped in a grid of water molecules with only a limited number of direct interactions between the protein molecules. The residues in the active site cleft belong to the most static parts of the structure. In general, disorder in atomic positions increases when going from the interior of the protein molecule to its surface. This behavior was quantified and it was found that the point of minimum disorder is near the molecular centroid.

1. Introduction
Papain is a thiol protease from the tree Carica papaya. The polypeptide chain of this enzyme contains 212 residues and has a molecular weight of 23,350. The essential sulfhydryl group resides on Cys25, while the other six cysteine residues

form three disulfide bridges. Because of its easy availability and its high stability. the enzyme has been the subject of many biochemical and biophysicaal st)udies. The three-dimensional structure of the papain molecule was one of the first protein structures to be determined (Jansonius, 1967; Koekoek, 1969; Drenth rf al., 1968,1971). This structure revealed that the polypeptide chain is folded int'o two domains of roughly equal size? but completely different conformation. The active site is composed of residues from both domains, as has been found in many enzymes. Subsequent studies included a proposal for the catalytic mechanism for the enzyme (Drenth et aE., 1975,1976). All these investigations were carried out at a resolution of 2.8 A. More recently, the three-dimensional structure of two related thiol proteases became available. Baker (1977) determined the crystal structure of actinidin from Actinidia chinensis (Kiwi) and later extended the resolution to 1.7 A (Baker, 1980). Heinemann et al. (1982) published the structure at 3.2 A resolution of Calotropin DI from Calotropus gigantea (Indian madar plant). Tn this article, we report the refinement of the papain crystal structure at 1.65 A resolution and the analysis of the molecular structure and thermal mobility, as well as the solvent structure in the crystal. A detailed comparison of the papain structure with the very similar structure of actinidin (Baker, 1980) will be published separately.

2. Experimental Procedures
(a) Isolation and crystallization

Papain was isolated from crude papaya latex by the method of Kimmel & Smith (1958). The product of this procedure consists of three components, which differ only in the attachment of atoms or groups of atoms to the active site cysteine 25. About 50% of the material has its Sy sulfur atom irreversibly oxidized (papain-SO,). Another part has a free SH group and is proteolytically active without activation. The third component (papainS-S-Cys) can be activated by a small thiol compound, such as fi-mercaptoethanol or by Na,SO,. The mixture of components was first of all activated with Na,SO, and then separated by affinity chromatography, applying the high affinity of the active site cysteine SH for an organic mercurial attached to an agarose column (Sluyterman & Wijdenes, 1970). Papain-SO, is not bound and appears in the eluate. The active papain is washed from the column with 6 m&r-P-mercaptoethanol and collected in a solution with a large excess of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide, which produces papain-S-S-C,H,OH. The solution of this product and of the eluate papain-SO, were concentrated in a diaflow apparatus and brought to pH 57. The enzyme was then precipitated by adding 1 ml of saturated NaCl solution per 30 ml of protein solution. After 1 night at 4°C and centrifugation at this temperature, a papain gel is obtained. This gel was dissolved in 0.5 M-sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and then dialyzed against distilled water. The enzyme was again precipitated with NaCl and centrifuged. This time, the gel was dissolved by adding an equal weight of methanol. From this solution, papain was crystallized as described (Drenth et al., 1976). C-type crystals are predominantly found in 62% (w / w ) methanol in water. This crystal type was used for the structure determination at 2.8 A resolution and was again used in the present study. The crystals belong to space group P2,2,2, with a = 4520 A, b = 104.64 A, c = 5098 A and 1 molecule in the asymmetric unit. Before mounting, the crystals were soaked in fresh mother liquor (0.1 M-B-aminoethanol buffer (pH 9.2); methanol added to 62%, w/w). For the high-resolution work described in this article, the papain-SO, crystals

were used because of the planned comparison with actinidin refinement was also carried out on the oxidized form. (b) Data collection

(Baker, 1980), for which the

All data were collected with a microprocessor-controlled oscillation camera. The X-ray beam was produced by an Elliott GX-6 rotating anode generator with a copper anode and equipped with a graphite monochromator. The beam size was defined by a 0.2 mm aperture in order to reduce the spot size on the film, resulting in less overlap at high resolution. Efficient data collection requires the b-axis to be parallel to the capillary axis for most of the exposures. However, b is perpendicular to the long axis of the needle-shaped crystals. Therefore, a bulge was blown in the capillary to achieve a stable mounting of the crystal. This was further guaranteed by a tiny drop of vacuum grease. Two films (Agfa-DlO-p) were packed in a V-shaped cassette (Enraf-Nonius) at 90.90 mm from the crystal. With a scan angle of 2.5" per exposure, the number of overlapping reflections remained below 5% even at high resolution. The exposure time per film pack was 3.75 h, resulting in a measurable intensity for the high-resolution spots but overexposure of the strong low-angle reflections. Thertafore. V-shaped and flat cassette exposures were alternated, the latter with 0.8 h exposure time. The complete data set. could be obtained with 4 crystals and a total exposure of 80 h/crystal. Several regions of reciprocal space were scanned twice with different crystals to check the absorption correction procedure, vide infra. The exposed films were digitized on an Optronics P-1000 film scanner in the SD-setting with a sampling size of 100 pm x 100 pm. Film non-linearity and microdensitometer characteristics were occasionally checked and corrected for by making a dose-response curve with a film calibration instrument originally designed by Smits & Wiebenga (1956). The oscillation film data were processed by an adapted version of the Munich program package (Schwager et al., 1975) that was extended for V-shaped cassettes. In the oscillation geometry, the primary beam path is essentially constant during an exposure and absorption effects on the secondary beam are partially compensated for by t,he individual H-factors of the film packs in the scaling process. However, in our case, absorption differences could be appreciable because of the high resolution, and the crystal mounting with the needle axis perpendicular to the capillary. Therefore, transmission curves were measured with the direct X-ray beam for different orientations of the crystal hy rotating it around the oscillation axis and around the vertical axis. Essential in this method, which is similar to that described by Schwager et al. (1973), is that the beam is smaller than and contained entirely within the crystal. Transmission was measured with a scintillation counter on the oscillation camera. Typical curves obtained in this way are shown in Fig. 1. From these curves, the absorption factor to be applied to the measured intensities as a function of crystal orientation and spot position can be calculated. To test the validity of the absorption correction, we compared interfilm R-factors? of film packs originating from different crystals but covering the same region in reciprocal space. These film packs are corrected with different absorption curves. We processed the corrected and non-corrected data separately. For 9 regions with altogether 3044 reflections, R dropped from an average value of 0.075 without to 0.072 with absorption correction. This is not substantial but, the improvement could be demonstrated further by the fact that the agreement between all multiply measured reflections was also slightly better. This was also true for the agreement between the F-values calculated with the final model and the absorption corrected data.

A total of 56 V-film and 48 flat film packs were processed for an entire data set up to 1.54 A resolution. Their scaling was performed according to the method of Hamilton et al. (1965), with the additional option of refining a relative isotropic temperature factor per film. This factor increased as a function of the X-ray exposure time due to radiation damage of the crystal. For the V-cassette data, 37,175 scaling reflections were found to give an average R value for the F terms, with respect to the mean F, of 3.5%, ranging from 2.85% for the low-resolution reflections to 6.60% for the 1.70 to 1.80 w region. For the flat films with 6358 scaling reflections, this value was 2.8% (ranging from 1.95% at low resolution to 3.4% at 3.37 to 3.20 A). This proves that the structure factors are of considerable accuracy, even at high resolution. Because of the high redundancy of the data, we did not include partial reflections (partly on one film and partly on the next) in the final data set, although they were only slightly less accurate than the fully measured reflections. In the high-resolution range, the percentage of actually measured reflections decreases quickly: it was 89% in a thin shell at 1.75 & 34% at 1.65 A and much lower beyond this resolution. Therefore, only data up to 1.65 A were incorporated in the final data set, which consists of 24,350 unique reflections.

3. The Refinement
(a) Method of rejinement The initial co-ordinates were from a 2.5 d resolution diffractometer data set and were refined by Baker (1981) using free atom refinement, FFTREF, alternated with regularization, MODFTT (Agarwal, 1978: Isaacs & Agarwal, 1978). Refinement was carried out with the aid of a restrained least-squares procedure using a set of programs originally written by Hendrickson & Konnert (1980) and

adapted for the Cyber 170/760 by Dr G. J. H. van Nes. The usual restraints on distances, angles, planar groups and chiral centers were applied (Table 1). No restraints were imposed on individual temperature factors, van der Waals contacts and hydrogen-bond distances. The main-chain conformation angles 4 and $, and most of the X-angles in side-chains were also not restrained. The active site Cys25-Sy was in an early stage of refinement found to be triply oxidized. Therefore, it was refined with ideal co-ordinates taken from the accurately determined structure of cysteic acid (Hendrickson & Karle, 1971). The C-O distance of methanol molecules was restrained to 1.44 A (Groth & Hassel, 1964). It was observed that the restraints on t'he geometry of the guanidino group of did result in unreasonably large arginine in the standard group dictionary deviations from chemically acceptable bond angles and from zero degrees for the dihedral angle 15. To avoid this, tighter restraints were imposed. The value of ~5, which was not restrained previously, was set at 0" in the standard dictionary and kept within limits by restraining the distances C'-Nq' and Cd-Nq2. The planarity of the guanidino group was further secured by adding C* to the plane formed by N" Cr Nq' and Nq2, as was done by Holmes & Matt,hews (1982). restrained refinement was allowed to proceed The' Hendrickson-Konnert automatically in steps of five or six cycles. After such a step, the model was analyzed by checking contact distances and conformational angles and by inspect'ion of various types of Fourier maps. Mispositioned residues and wrong conformations were manually corrected on an Evans & Sutherland Picture System IT using the program package GUIDE (Brandenburg et al., 1981). By an automated peak search in the difference Fouriers using the XRAYsystem (Stewart, 1976), it was possible to locate additional solvent sites. They were carefully checked with respect to distances to, and co-ordination angles with neighboring hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Only if they persisted through maps in the later stages of refinement were they kept in the co-ordinate list. Methanol molecules appeared as elongated density peaks. Their interpretation, however, was approached with caution, because even at the high resolution of the present study (1.65 A), it is difficult to discriminate between partially occupied, adjoining, water sites and methanol molecules. A few cycles of unrestrained, freeatom refinement using the FFTREF-program on a late-stage co-ordinate set, showed that the C and 0 atoms had no strong tendency to refine away from each other. This made us more confident in our interpretation.

(b) Course of the rejnement A total of resolution of conformations refinement. mispositioned 38 refinement cycles were performed while gradually increasing the the data and extending the solvent structure. Twenty-four side-chain were readjusted one or more times in the successive stages of Even late-stage co-ordinate sets with a low R-value showed residues. The following specific points are noteworthy. residue at position 152 was very clear in all stages of the

(2) The main-chain conformation could be identified unambiguously except for two regions. A discontinuity in the electron density exists between Gly192 and Thr193 even in low contour level maps. This is a disordered piecr 01 structure at t,he outside of the molecule. Furthermore, the carbony group of Ser21 resisted proper refinement. Its orientation was visible in the maps and was corrected. Subsequent refinement: however, did result in a shift of this group out of the density, probably to obey the restraints set by thrk refinement method. (3) As to the arginine side-chain conformations, doubt remains about Arg59. Arg98 and Arg145. The side-chain density was partially discontinuous or in some cases even absent. The same is true for LyslO, Lys139 and Lys156. (4) Tyr197 and Tyr94 show some discontinuity in their side-chains. (5) Further disordered side-chains include Asn84, Gln9 and Gln114. All disordered or partially ordered side-chains are found at the surface of the molecule. The restraint information for the final model is given in Table 1. In the final difference Fourier map, the maximum peak height is 49.4 (arbitrary units). This figure can be compared to a height of 600 for the sulfur peaks (16 electrons) in the (3F,,--2kF,) Fourier map. This indicates that nearly all of the density has been accounted for satisfactorily by the model. In the final Fouriers, weak electron

(c) The accuracy of the jinal model

The final model had an average root-mean-square shift of 0.418 A from the starting model (Baker, 1981; 2.5 A resolution). The R-factors as a function of resolution for the two models with respect to the oscillation data are shown in Figure 2. The final R-factor is 16.1 y. for data between 10.0 A and 1.65 A. It compares well with results from other proteins refined to a similar resolution (e.g. see Baker & Dodson, 1980; Dijkstra et al., 1981). In agreement with these studies, we estimate the standard deviation in the atomic positions to be between 0.08 A and 0.12 A. The extent to which certain parts of the refined papain and actinidin structures are similar (Kamphuis et al., unpublished results) indicates that the co-ordinate errors in both structures are within these limits, except for some regions with large thermal vibration parameters. (d) Conformational angles: a check on the quality
of the model

The main-chain dihedral angles cp and II/ were not restrained during the refinement. Nevertheless, all cp/$ combinations for non-glycine residues are found within the outer limit boundary of a Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3: see Ramakrishnan & Rapachandran, 1965). Out of bound glycine residues are found in regions allowed for n-amino acids with C/l atoms. Apart from ~5, no restraint was imposed on the side-chain dihedral angles. For xl, the staggered positions at 60", 180" and 300" are clearly favored. The order of

preference 300" > 180" > 60" was also found in the analysis of other refined protein structures (e.g. see Watenpaugh et al., 1979). For 12 and ~3, 180" values are predominantly found in the case of tetrahedral co-ordination for Cy and C', respectively, indicating a preference for an extended side-chain conformation. This is not surprising, as the residues mainly involved (Lys, Arg, Glu and Gln) are mostly located at the surface of the protein. Apart from cis-Pro152, the w-angles are distributed virtually symmetrically is around 180" with a standard deviation of 6". For ~x-~~-~, the distribution symmetric around the value of 109" (s.D. 3.5") accepted for most protein structures. Ilel is the single residue with a deviating z-value, 90.1". This residue nevertheless fits well into the final electron density. Interestingly, in the closely related enzyme actinidin, Leul has also an exceptional z-value of 139.7".

4. The Papain Structure
The 212 amino acid residue chain in the molecule is folded into two domains: L, with residues 10 to 111 and 208 to 212, and R, with residues 1 to 9 and 112 to 207.

Main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds are shown by broken lines. Stereo Figs 4 and 5 were made with the computer graphics program GUIDE (Brandrnhurp rt al.. 1981).

The L domain is niainly parallel P-sheet structure

cc-helical; the key feature of the R domain is its anti(Drenth et al., 1971). (a) a- Helices

The L domain has three cr-helices (Fig. 4). The first helix (L I) contains residues 24 to 42. It is not a perfect a-helix: the carbonyl oxygen of the first residue, i, forms hydrogen bonds to the amide protons of residues i+ 3 and i+4 (Table 2). Moreover, the hydrogen-bond pattern is disrupted, since 29-O and 33-N are too far apart for hydrogen bond formation. This distortion could be caused by OY of Thr33, forming a hydrogen bond with Ala30-0 at 2.58 d, thereby locally increasing the pitch of the helix somewhat. L I, although mainly buried, has a polar and an apolar side, contributing to the domain-domain interface and to the hydrophobic core of domain L, respectively. This helix contains the catalytically important Cys25 at its N terminus. Helix L II comprises residues 50 to 57 and is buried. L III (residues 67 to 78) has one side exposed to solvent. As found with the two previous helices, the N terminus of L III exhibits 3,, character as the carbonyl oxygen of the first residue, i, forms hydrogen bonds with the amide protons i+3 and i+4. Despite the fact that L II is buried, it contains the acidic residues Glu50, Glu52 and Asp.57. Charge compensation is achieved for Glu50 by Arg83 and for Glu52 by Hi&l. No opposite charge can be found for Asp57. Its carboxyl group is in contact with Ser60-OY, Ser70-OY and Arg59-Pi. Either the hydrogen-bonding

The criteria defining an a-helix were as follows: (I) If hydrogen honds followed the helical pattern, the residues were included regardless of their cp/$ angles. (2) Otherwise residues were included if their cp/$ angles did not deviate more than 45" from the ideal values as defined by Arnott & Wonacott (1966). Obviously, the cp angle of the first residue and the J, angle of the last residue can assume quite different values. Only hydrogen bonds are considered for which the amide proton-carbonyl oxygen distance is less than 2.4 A. The amide proton was generated according to standard geometry at a distance of l+O A to the adjacent nitrogen atom. The residues marked with an asterisk were included in the calculation of average values. Distances are in A. angles are given in degrees.

environment is able to compensate the charge on this carboxylate group with a similar efficiency as bulk water or the carboxyl group of Asp57 is protonated. Helix L II is roughly anti-parallel to L I. Their axes, however, are shifted in such a way that the positive charges at the N termini (Ho1 et al., 1978) come uncomfortably close. The axis of helix L III is oriented perpendicular to helix L II and makes an angle of 60" with the L I helix axis, with the N terminal coming rather close (Fig. 4). The electrostatic interactions of charged residues in the interior of the papain molecule may compensate the unfavorable disposition of the helix dipoles in the first domain. The R domain contains two helices: R I, residues 117 to 127 and R II, residues 138 to 143. Both are located in the surface region at opposite ends of the central b-sheet structure, which forms the core of this domain (Fig. 5). The diversity in the hydrogen bonding and conformational parameters of the helices in papain can be explained by the intervention of side-chains and solvent molecules in the ideal hydrogen-bond pattern and by packing effects of sidechains. If we consider only the three principal helices (L I, L III and R I) and leave out their N and C-terminal regions, we can calculate some general characteristics of the a-helix (Table 3). As was found for other refined protein structures, the average conformational angles (cp, -64(8)"; 9, -41(6)") deviate

significantly from those of a "classical" cc-helix (Amott & Wonacott, 1966). In the conformation with cp = -64" and + = -41", the C=O bonds are directed more outwards than in a classical a-helix. As a result, the NH bonds are pointing inwards. This leads to a longer hydrogen bond: 2.98 b compared to 2.89 A.
(h) /?-Sheet structure

The main secondary structure characteristic of the R domain is its anti-parallel j-sheet structure (Fig. 5). The central strand runs from residues 158 to 167. This strand is broken up into two parts between residues 164 and 165, resulting in an angle of about 120" between the two strand axes. The diversity in hydrogenbonding parameters and conformational angles is considerably larger than for the

The hydrogen bond criteria are the same as in Table 2. Residues and distances used for calculating average values are marked with an asterisk. Residues are included in the calculation of average cp/$-values if these angles deviate less than 45" from the ideal values given by Chothia (1973). These residues are also included in the calculation of the average hydrogen-bond distance if they form a hydrogen bond with another p-strand residue. Residue 134 is excluded because it forms 2 hydrogen bonds, and residue 149 because it is part of a very short P-strand.

a-helims (Table 4). We arrive at, an average value for cp of - 12% (0 = 23') and for $ of 146" (0 = 19"). These values deviate substantially from thaw of air rxtended anti-parallel /J-sheet with cp = - 139" and $ = 135' (Pauling & (`orthy. 1953). Eetter agreement is found with a b-sheet with a right-handed tlvist (cp = - 120", $ = 150": Chot,hia. 1973; and see Ta,ble 5). The t)wist of the a-shret. however, is not uniform. Hydrogen bonds in the rare of the sheet are generally shorter than those at the more twisted ends: t'he average value of the donoracceptor distance is 2.91 A. We compared the b-sheet paramet,ers with t,hose of and found them to be extremely similar (Table 5). The residues actinidin participating in the sheet structure are mostly hydrophobic. Polar residues are found at the end of the strands. The main-chain atoms participating in the sheet surround a large barrel-like cavity (Fig. .5) in the interior of the R domain (Richardson, 1981). which is filled with hydrophobic side-chains. (c) Turns Turns were defined by the condition that the distance CF-@T+3 is less than 6.0 8. excluding a-helices. Their conformational parameters are listed in Table 6 together with their type assignment, based on the conventions of Venkatachalam (1968) and Crawford et al. (1973). Some turns should have Gly in a certain position, but this rule is hardly obeyed. The hydrogen-bond distance Ni+3-Oi is relatively long and the hydrogen bonds are far from linear. Hydrogen-bond formation: therefore, is perhaps not an essential prerequisite for turn formation (Richardson, 1981). The turns are located almost exclusively at the surface of the e.g. residues protein. Consecutive turns form small pieces of 3,0 -helical structure, 6 to 10 and 82 to 86. (d) The solvent structure Twenty-one water molecules are trapped during the association of the two domains and during the folding of the N and C termini across the domains. They have a zero accessible surface and a low B-factor. Most of them have a bridging function. A further ten buried water molecules are found in depressions of the protein surface. The 164 non-buried water molecules we observed surround the protein in a monomolecular and sometimes bimolecular layer. This layer does not form a closed shell but is discontinuous at some places, e.g. at the two ends of the cylindrical b-barrel in the R domain. These non-buried solvent shell water molecules can be subdivided into five types. (1) Protein bridging water molecules. They have a relatively low B-factor (B = 39( 18) A2) and g'Ive rise to ordered solvent of up to four layers between neighboring protein molecules. They probably play an important role in the stacking of protein molecules to form a crystal and in maintaining crystal stability. (2) Water bound to at least one main-chain atom. The B-values in this category are, on the average. 37(14) A'.

(3) Water bound not to main-chain atoms, but to at least one side-chain atom. The B-value in this category is higher than for the water molecules mentioned before. This may be correlated to the fact that the hydrogenbond donors and acceptors of side-chain atoms have generally a higher B-factor than main-chain atoms. (4) Second hydration shell water (B = 52(9) a2). (5) Water molecules without neighboring atoms within 3.3 A. The high value of their average B-factor (57(11) A2) indicates that they are not too wellstabilized in their position by the environment. The possibility that some of them represent refinement artefacts must not be excluded. The arrangement of ligands around water molecules resembles the structure of ice, because the values for the co-ordination angles are distributed approximately around the value for tetrahedral co-ordination, although the spread is appreciable: the standard deviation is between 15" and 20". If the ligands come very close, a trigonal arrangement with 120" angles seems to be favored, probably due to repulsion between the closest ligands. Although the crystallization medium is rich in methanol, a surprisingly small number of solvent molecules can be regarded with any certainty as methanol molecules: 29 out of 224 solvent molecules. Most of the methanol molecules bind to exposed areas of the enzyme. They have relatively high B-values. Only three methanol molecules are found inside the protein structure. The oxygen atoms of these molecules bind to Tyr78-0, Lys106-NC and water 99, to 153-O and 200-N near the S-S bond 153-200, and to an internal water molecule, respectively. Summarizing, it may be stated that the solvent in papain plays an important role in maintaining structural stability. This is especially true for internal water. For non-buried solvent, the structural role increases with the number of ligands (Bone & Pethig, 1982) and is inversely proportional to the B-factor (Holmes & Matt'hews. 1982).
(e) Intermolecular contacts

The direct protein-protein contacts include nine hydrogen-bond connections between protein atoms and only three ionic interactions (Table 7). As judged from their distances and the temperature mobility of the atoms involved, the strongest salt bridge is between Asp140 and Argl91. The hydrophobic effect appears to play a minor role in the stacking of the papain molecules. Water molecules, on the other hand, play an important role in arranging the papain molecules in the crystal. Twenty-one water molecules are located in contact areas between adjacent papain molecules, some in a monomolecular solvent layer only, others in a complex arrangement giving rise to up to four layers of ordered water molecules. The picture emerges of protein molecules trapped in a grid of water molecules with only a limited number of direct interactions between the protein molecules. The comparative study with actinidin, which has a different crystal packing, shows that the main-chain conformation is hardly affected by intermolecular contacts, and that the effect of crystal packing on the structure is very limited indeed (Kamphuis et al., unpublished results).

(f) The active site The crystals contain an inactive form of the enzyme, oxidized at Cys25. We find electron density for three oxygen atoms attached to Sy. All three are wellstabilized by hydrogen bonds. Figure 6 gives a schematic view of the residues most intimately involved in catalysis. The 06' atom of cysteic acid 25 is within hydrogen-bonding distance from Gln19-N"' (d = 3.20 A; < (NE2-O"-S): 129") and the main-chain N of Cys25 (d = 2.93 A; < (N-O"-S): 79.4"). 06i occupies the oxyanion hole that is, according to the catalytic mechanism, reserved for the substrate Pl carbonyl oxygen atom (Drenth et al., 1975,1976). The 0" atom, pointing into the active site groove of the molecule, forms hydrogen bonds to Trp26-N (2.83 A; <(N-OS2-S): 108") and to the oxygen of a poorly ordered methanol molecule. The Oa3 atom forms hydrogen bonds with His159-N" (2.71 A; < (Nd'-Os3-S): 122") and with the N atom of Ala160 (2.91 A; < (N-Od3-S): 126"). Water molecule 42 competes with 0 63 for hydrogen bonding to the N" proton of His159 (d = 3.05 A; (Ha'--Nd'-0): 27"). The electron density of water molecule 42, which is near the proposed position of the NH in the Pl-P2 peptide group, is rather elongated and it can also be interpreted as a methanol. If so, it could play a role in the inactivation of papain by methanol. Above the imidazole ring of His159 is the side-chain of Asn175. It has hydrogen-bonding partners only at 06': His159-N"' and Serl76-N. In the catalytic mechanism as proposed by Drenth et al. (1976), the imidazole moiety rotates over 30" about the 0-U bond. This ring then becomes almost

equiplanar with Cys25Sy and Asn1750 a' . In the refined structure, the S to N61 distance would then be 3.01 A. This is somewhat shorter than the expected distance of 3.4 A (Hamilton & Ibers, 1968). It indicates that the active site groove might widen during catalysis (Drenth et al., 1976; Lowe & Yuthavong, 1971). As also observed in other proteins, the residues in the active site cleft show below average temperature factors. Most of the water molecules in this region are also fairly immobile. (g) Mobility Atomic B-factors were not restrained during the refinement. Therefore, their values are not influenced by a model imposed on the motion of main chain and side-chains. A plot of the average B-factors as a function of residue number is given in Figure 7. Also, the fraction f of the residue's surface, which remains accessible to solvent in the folded protein is plotted. In general, the side-chain mobilities follow the pattern of the main chain. This indicates a concerted motion of main-chain and side-chain atoms. The patterns also show that the mean B-factors are correlated to the surface accessibility for solvent. Quantitatively, the average main-chain B-factors satisfy the linear relation: B = O-81 xf-5.9 with a correlation coefficient of 0.566. For side-chain B-factors, the relation is

The broken line gives the fractionf of solvent-accessible surface for these atoms: plCi" x looah, k isolated where &o,ein is the average solvent-accessible area of the residue atoms in the protein; Sisolaledis the average solvent-accessible area for an isolated residue. Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated with a probe radius of 1.4A using the program ACCESS described by Richards (1977) and kindly made available to us by Dr M. Rternberg. f-

H = 1.10 xf-6.7 with a correlation coefficient of 0.667. The outer shell of the molecule, composed of the chain segments 1 to 20, 38 to 46, 60 to 124, 136 to 160, 176 to 198 and the last three C-terminal residues, has a high temperature mobility. The information from the isotropic temperature factors allows us to make the following specific observations. (1) Hydrophobic residues, which are found mostly in the protein interior, have low temperature mobilities, a small difference in B-factor between main and side-chain, and a low spread in these values. (2) Acidic and basic residues have a larger spread in B-values for their side-

chains, The more anchored they are by electrostatic or hydrogen-bond interactions, the lower their B-factors are. (3) On the average, serine side-chains are less well-ordered than those of threonine residues due to the packing effect of Cy2 on the latter, which hinders free rotation around C"-CB. The B-factors tend to increase when going from the interior of the protein molecaule to its surface. It is possible to quantify this behavior by calculating correlation coefficients between (u),,, per residue (averaged over C". C, 0, N and (`8) and a value (u),,,c linearly related to the distance d to a point P: (u),,,c = @Xi-, Y,, 2,) + b. An iterative search for the maximum of the correlation coefficient was carried out by varying the co-ordinates of P. Table 8 shows the result of this analysis for the whole molecule and for the two domains separately. The strongest positive cborrelation exists for a point near the centroid of the included atoms. Figure 8 illustrates the relation between (u),,, and d(X,, Y,, 2,) at the maximum correlat'ion point. A similar result is found if only atoms of the two individual domains are included; the centroid is displaced, but the maximum correlation point remains in the vicinity of the centroid of all main-chain atoms. The same procedure for the water molecules gives maximum correlation for a point near the protein molecular centroid, albeit with a lower correlation coefficient. We can translate the coefficients a and b into components of the overall motion of the protein in the crystal. The b term, corresponding to 0.2 8, defines the component of motion not coupled to a point. It therefore includes static disorder and translational motions of the molecule as a whole. The a term can be translated into an intramolecular motion with an amplitude increasing with d(X,. Y,, Z,) or into a libration motion (Artymiuk et al., 1979). Judging from the rigidit,y of the intermolecular contacts, the latter type of motion is not very probable. The results obtained compare very well with similar studies on cytochrome c (Matsuura et al., 1982) and on thermolysin (Holmes & Matthews, 1982). It is

They are the variables in the process. is calculated for each residue from its distance d to the central point with the equation (ii;;:;: = ad+ b.

X, Y, and 2 were varied until the maximum correlation between (u),,,~ and ma,,% was found. The Cartesian co-ordinates of this maximum correlation point P are 33.6; 70.1; 12.0. It is situated near atom Va132-CY'. The correlation coefficient is 0.777. The linear relation between (u),.,~ and d(X,, Yp, Z&is: Yr, 2,)+0~1970. This line is indicated in the graph. The crosses give the (u),,, (U),.k = 0.01234X,, values.

interesting to note, however, that in the study of thermolysin, also a two-domain protein, the maximum correlation point for the separate domain is not near the molecular centroid, but near the centroid of the individual domains. An alternative mode of motion in a two-domain protein is hinge bending around an axis. Therefore, a similar search for a function R(X,, Y,, Z,, a,, a,) describing the correlation between (u),,, and a distance to a line was performed; a line was defined by the co-ordinates of a point P and two direction cosines, a, and a2. It was found that lower correlation coefficients were obtained and that the gradients aR/aa, and aR/iTa, of this five-dimensional function in the neighborhood of the maximum R value were too small to uniquely define a line. Therefore, the possibility of a hinge-bending motion of the two domains must be considered unlikely. This is supported by the fact that the internal water molecules at the domain-domain interface have low temperature factors.

5. Discussion
In this study, we have determined the structure of papain with high accuracy. This result will subsequently be used for a comparison with the structure of the

related enzyme actinidin (Baker, 1980). In the refinement of papain, non-bonded interactions were not restrained. Nevertheless, the number of too close contacts is surprisingly small: 16 shorter than 3.4 A between carbon atoms and 21 shorter than 3.0 a between C and 0. Some of them may not be real, because they exist between partially ordered residues and water molecules. This result strengthens our confidence in the accuracy of the structure. From an analysis of the structure, we arrive at the following general conclusions. (1) In addition to the cp/$ values, the hydrogen-bonding angles and distances are a characteristic property of secondary structure elements. (2) Other hydrogen bonds show a larger diversity, but play an important role in maintaining the structure, as judged by their number, and by the fact that very few hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are unsatisfied. (3) Buried charges are compensated by counter charges in almost all cases. (4) Water molecules sometimes play a role in this compensation by bridging between positively and negatively charged groups. Water molecules, present in ice-like networks, add to the stabilization of the structure. This is specially true for internal water involved in the domain-domain interface and for those binding to the N and C termini. (5) Most protein-protein contacts in the crystal involve many water molecules with low temperature factors. (6) Because main-chain and side-chain mobilities show a fair correlation to the fractional accessible surface area, it could be possible in the early stages of a refinement, or in the absence of high resolution data, to estimate individual isotropic B-factors from the solvent-accessible surface area.
