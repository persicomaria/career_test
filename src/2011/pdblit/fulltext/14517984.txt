Introduction. The Berkeley Structural Genomics Center (BSGC) has focused on Mycoplasma as its structural genomics target organisms because of their compact genome size as well as their relevance to human and animal pathogenicity (http://www.strgen.org). The gene for transfer RNA (m1G37) methyltransferase of Aquifex aeolicus (GI number 2983865) is one of the structural genomics targets of BSGC that has been selected as a homolog of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) gene MPN183, trmD (http:// www.strgen.org/status/mptargets.html). The protein structures coded by either gene are not known. It is one of the tRNA-modifying enzymes that catalyzes the transfer of methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to guanosine at position 37, the nucleoside adjacent to and 3 of the anticodon. This protein is important for the maintenance of the correct reading frame during translation.1,2 In all organisms, the tRNA-reading codons CUN (Leu), CCN (Pro), and CGG (Arg) contain at position 37 1-methylguanosine (m1G37), and tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferases from members of all three phylogenetic domains show sequence similarities.3 Currently, no structural information is available for this protein family. Here, we report the crystal structure of the enzyme tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferase from Aquifex aeolicus at 2.6 Å resolution. The structure reveals a novel methyltransferase fold distinctly different from those of the most common methyltransferases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein production. The trmD gene from A. aeolicus was amplified by PCR using A. aeolicus genomic DNA template and inserted into pHM6g expression vector, a derivative of pSKB3 (a gift from Steve Burley, Rockfeller University) having a 6-His-maltose binding protein (MBP)-tobacco etch virus (TEV) sites as an N-terminal fusion. Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/ pSJS1244 Star4 upon induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl- D-thiogalactopyranoside. Selenomethionyl (Se-Met) protein was prepared according to the method of Doublie.5 For protein purification, 15.5 g of cell paste were resuspended in 135 mL 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, and lysed by sonication. In a first purification step, NaCl concentra©

tion of the supernatant was adjusted to 300 mM before loading of the His-MBP-tagged target protein onto a cobalt affinity column (Talon resin; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The target protein was eluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole. For MBP cleavage, the eluted protein solution was mixed with 360 g mTEV and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT at 4°C (buffer A) overnight. The dialyzed protein was then heated to 70°C for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g to remove precipitated nontarget proteins. For further purification to remove 6-His-MBP, the protein solution was then loaded onto a 5-mL HiTrapQ anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in buffer A from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 20 column volumes. The target protein was in the flowthrough fraction and was concentrated to 7 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT for crystallization. The homogeneity of the protein was assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiment using DynaPro99 DLS machine (Protein Solutions, NJ). Crystallization. Screening for the crystallization condition was done by the sparse matrix screening method.6 A 1- L protein solution was mixed with a 1- L reservoir solution containing 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 20% PEG 3000, and equilibrated over 1 mL of reservoir solution. Crystals grew within a few days at room temperature. Data Collection. For data collection, crystals were transferred to harvesting buffer (reservoir solution 5% PEG

CHECK9 analysis shows that the model has good overall geometry, with 97.3% residues in the most favored regions and additional allowed regions, and no residues falling in disallowed region of Ramachandran space (Table I). Results and Discussion. Structure. We determined the structure of the tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferase from Aquifex aeolicus to 2.6 Å resolution using the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) technique (Table I). The monomer of the protein consists of two separate domains connected by a long partially disordered loop region (Fig. 1). The Nterminal domain consists of seven -strands and seven -helices (residues 4 ­164), arranged as a parallel -sheet sandwiched by -helices. The C-terminal domain (residues 179 ­235) consists of a long loop region and four short -helices. In the crystal, each asymmetric unit contains three monomers. Two of the monomers in the asymmetric unit associate into a tight dimer through a twofold noncrystallographic axis (Fig. 1). Another monomer forms the same kind of dimer through the twofold crystallographic axis. The dimer has approximate dimensions of 72 45 45 Å. The structure suggests that the dimer may be the functional form for the following reasons: 1) the interactions between monomers are very extensive and tight as manifested by many nonpolar interactions commonly observed in biologically functional oligomer interfaces12; 2) the surface area buried by the dimer (1920 Å2 for each monomer) is comparable to those from other oligomeric proteins and is larger than the area buried by typical crystal contacts12; 3) DLS data of the protein solution also suggest that the tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferase from A. aeolicus is oligomeric (dimmer or trimer) state in solution (data not shown). New Methyltransferase Fold. A structural similarity search, performed by the DALI13 server, with the coordinates of N-terminal domain of the protein, indicated that the protein is structurally similar to protein mt0001, a hypothetical protein from Methanobacterium Thermoautotrophicum [z score 6.8, Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1K3R] with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of 3.0 Å for the superimposition of 110 C atoms. The sequence identity between the N-terminal domain of our protein and mt0001 is only 4%. The structural similarity search with the coordinates of the C-terminal domain did not identify any similar structures in the DALI data base with z score of 2, indicating that this domain is a novel structural fold. In all DALI search results with z score of 2, no classic Rossman-fold type methyltransferase structures (found in all hitherto known methyltransferases) are identified, suggesting the tRNA (m1G37) methyltransferase structure represents a novel methyltransferase fold. Although Dali search did not find any structural homologs other than the hypothetical protein mt0001, there is a recent protein structure of another novel methyltransferase, YibK, which has a unique "knotted" topology.14 Our structure does not have the knotted topology, and RMSD between YibK and our structure is 3.2

3000) for approximately 30 s and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beamline 5.0.2 at 100°K with a Quantum 4 charge-coupled device (CCD) detector and processed with HKL 2000.7 Data statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure Solution and Refinement. The positions of all nine selenium sites within the three monomers in an asymmetric unit (excluding the N-terminal methionines) were identified from MAD data using SOLVE.8 Initial phases were greatly improved by density modification with multidomain NCS averaging (DMMULTI, CCP4 suite9 program). For each monomer, 217 of the 257 amino acids were built into the resultant maps using the program O10 by using the selenium sites as guides. No density was visible for the first four N-terminal amino acids, part of the loop region that connects N-terminal domain and Cterminal domain (residues 165­178), and the C-terminus 22 amino acids. Refinement of the initial model was performed with the program CNS11 using the peak data with both phase and NCS restraints. Three runs of manual rebuilding were performed by using sigmaA-weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps and Ramachandran analysis as guides. The final refinement was done with the TLS program in CCP49 suite followed by two runs of manual model rebuilding and addition of waters. A total of 81 water molecules were added to the final model.
