The cAMP-mediated allosteric transition in the catabolite activator protein (CAP; also known as the cAMP receptor protein, CRP) is a textbook example of modulation of DNA-binding activity by smallmolecule binding. Here we report the structure of CAP in the absence of cAMP, which, together with structures of CAP in the presence of cAMP, defines atomic details of the cAMP-mediated allosteric transition. The structural changes, and their relationship to cAMP binding and DNA binding, are remarkably clear and simple. Binding of cAMP results in a coil-to-helix transition that extends the coiled-coil dimerization interface of CAP by 3 turns of helix and concomitantly causes rotation, by 60°, and translation, by 7 Å, of the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of CAP, positioning the recognition helices in the DBDs in the correct orientation to interact with DNA. The allosteric transition is stabilized further by expulsion of an aromatic residue from the cAMP-binding pocket upon cAMP binding. The results define the structural mechanisms that underlie allosteric control of this prototypic transcriptional regulatory factor and provide an illustrative example of how effector-mediated structural changes can control the activity of regulatory proteins.

he Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) (1) is a transcriptional activator known to regulate hundreds of transcription units by responding to fluctuations of the cellular concentration of cAMP (2). CAP is an 50-kDa homodimer comprising 209 residues per subunit (supporting information (SI) Fig. S1). Each subunit is organized in 2 distinct domains: (i) an N-terminal cAMP-binding domain (CBD; residues 1­136), which contains the cyclic nucleotide-binding module and a long -helix (C-helix) that mediates dimerization through formation of an intersubunit coiled coil, and (ii) a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD; residues 139­209), which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for binding to DNA. The 2 domains are linked by a short hinge region (residues 137­138). cAMP elicits an allosteric transition that switches CAP from the ``off'' state, which binds DNA weakly and nonspecifically, to the ``on'' state, which binds DNA strongly and specifically. In the cAMP-bound state, CAP binds to DNA sites located in or adjacent to target promoters resulting in modulation of interactions of RNA polymerase with target promoters (1, 3). The cAMP-mediated allosteric transition in CAP is a textbook example of modulation of DNA-binding activity by small-molecule binding and has been the subject of extensive structural, biophysical, biochemical, and genetic analysis (4). CAP was the first transcription regulatory protein to have its 3D structure determined (5). The 3D structures of CAP have been determined in its cAMP-bound state (6) and in its cAMP-bound state in complex with DNA (7, 8). Nevertheless, the structural basis of the cAMP-mediated allosteric transition in CAP has remained unclear, because the structure of CAP in the absence of cAMP was unknown. Here, we report the solution structure of CAP in the absence of cAMP (apo-CAP). The structural changes, and their relationship to cAMP binding and DNA binding, are remarkably clear and simple. The present results, together with previously

determined in solution by NMR. Only 1 set of resonances is present for both subunits of CAP in the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Fig. S2 A), suggesting that CAP exists as a symmetric dimer in solution. Because of the large size of CAP ( 50 kDa), we applied multidimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments in combination with a series of strategically designed samples tailored to improve and simplify resonance assignment and structure determination and to yield the maximum number of structural restraints (Figs. 1 A C and S2). In addition, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments (9) provided a large number of very long distance restraints (up to 28 Å) between the CBD and DBD, and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) (10) were used to define the relative orientation of the CBD and DBD unambiguously (Fig. S3). In total, 5,000 restraints (per subunit) were used to determine the structure of the dimeric 50 kDa apo-CAP at high resolution (Table S1). The NMR solution structure of apo-CAP is represented by an ensemble of the 20 lowest-energy conformers (Fig. 1D).
apo-CAP DBD Adopts an Orientation That Is Incompatible with Specific DNA Binding. Superposition of the structure of apo-CAP on the

structures of CAP-cAMP2 (6) or CAP-cAMP2-DNA (7, 8) reveals that the DBD adopts dramatically different positions relative to the CBD in apo-CAP vs. CAP-cAMP2 or CAP-cAMP2-DNA (Fig. 2). In the structure of CAP-cAMP2-DNA, the recognition helices (F-helices) of the DBDs of the CAP dimer insert into successive DNA major grooves and make extensive contacts with DNA base pairs and the sugar-phosphate backbone (7, 8). In the structure of CAP-cAMP2 (6), the F-helices of the DBDs of the CAP dimer are positioned essentially as in the structure of CAP-cAMP2-DNA (i.e., positioned so as to be able to insert into successive DNA major grooves). In contrast, in the structure of apo-CAP, the F-helices are rotated by 60° and translated by 7 Å relative to their orientations and positions in the structure of CAP-cAMP2-DNA (Fig. 2C) and thus are not positioned to insert into successive DNA major grooves. In short, in the cAMP-liganded state, the recognition

helices are oriented correctly to interact with successive DNA major grooves, but in the cAMP-free state, the recognition helices are out of register with successive DNA major grooves (Fig. 2 A and C).
The Coiled Coil Is Partially Unwound in apo-CAP. In the structures of

CAP-cAMP2 and CAP-cAMP2-DNA the CBD C-helix, which forms an intersubunit C-helix/C -helix (where denotes the second CAP subunit) coiled coil, extends from residues Pro-110 to Phe136. In contrast, in the structure of apo-CAP, the C-helix and the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil extend only to Gln-125 (11) (Fig. 2 A and B and Fig. S1). This difference in the length of the C-helix, and of the C-helix/C -helix coiled coil, represents 3 turns of helix. In apo-CAP, the 11-residue segment comprising Val-126 to Phe-136 is unstructured (Fig. 2 A and B), and NMR relaxation data show that this segment undergoes substantial motions on a picoto-nanosecond (ps to ns) time scale, suggesting substantial flexibility (Fig. S4). As a result, in apo-CAP the linker, or hinge, between CBD and DBD is 11 residues longer than in CAP-cAMP2-DNA and CAP-cAMP2, and multiple critical contacts between the CBD C-helix and the DBD D-helix are disrupted (Fig. 2D). We conclude that the difference in the length of the C-helix and of the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil is primarily responsible for the difference in the orientation of the DBD in the cAMP-free state vs. the cAMP-bound state.
Structural Basis for the cAMP-Elicited Allosteric Transition. How does cAMP switch CAP from the inactive to the active conformation? The key structural change induced by cAMP is a coil-to-helix transition of the Val-126 to Phe-136 segment resulting in extension of the C-helix by 3 turns in CAP-cAMP2 (Fig. 2 A and B). The primary contributor to this coil-to-helix transition is the direct interaction of the cAMP adenine base with the side-chain hydroxyl of residues Thr-127 and Ser-128, which are located in the unstructured segment. In apo-CAP, Thr-127 and Ser-128 point away from the cAMP-binding pocket (Fig. 3A). cAMP engages these 2 resi6928 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0900595106

dues in favorable hydrogen bonds with its adenine base (atoms N-1, N-6, and N-7) causing both residues to relocate and reorient (with Ser-128 undergoing a remarkable swiveling motion of 120°) (Fig. 3A). The cAMP-stabilized locations and orientations of Thr-127 and Ser-128 nucleate and/or stabilize helix formation within the Val-126 to Phe-136 segment and, correspondingly, nucleate and/or stabilize intersubunit coiled-coil formation (Figs. 2B and 3A). A second contributor to the coil-to-helix transition may be a number of interactions between the cAMP sugar-phosphate moiety and CAP (Fig. 3B). The cAMP sugar-phosphate moiety interacts with a conserved phosphate-binding cassette (PBC), which is the ``signature'' motif for all cAMP-binding proteins (residues Gly-71 to Ala-84 in CAP) (12). In apo-CAP, the guanidinium side-chain of Arg-82 forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate side-chain of Glu-129 , potentially stabilizing the unstructured, non-helical conformation of the Val-126 to Phe136 segment (Fig. 3B). Upon binding of cAMP, Arg-82 relocates, enters the cAMP-binding pocket, and forms a salt bridge with the cAMP phosphate (Fig. 3B); the relocation of Arg-82 disrupts the salt bridge with Glu-129 and thus potentially destabilizes the non-helical conformation of the Val-126 to Phe-136 segment (Fig. 3B). In apo-CAP, residues Glu-72 to Glu-77 of the PBC form a short -helix that provides the scaffold for the formation of 2 favorable salt bridges involving Glu-77, Glu-78, and Arg122 (Fig. 3B). Binding of cAMP disrupts this short -helix, thereby disrupting the salt bridges involving Glu-77, Glu-78, and Arg-122 and causing Arg-122 to relocate and form a salt bridge with Glu-129 that potentially stabilizes the helical conformational state of the Val-126 to Phe-136 segment (Fig. 3B). A third contributor to the coil-to-helix transition may be the cAMP-forced expulsion of an aromatic residue from the cAMPbinding pocket. In the absence of cAMP, the cAMP-binding pocket, which is primarily hydrophobic, is occupied by the side chain of Trp-85 (Fig. 3C). Binding of cAMP displaces Trp-85, which is expelled from the hydrophobic core into the solvent (Fig. 3C). This

Lys-130 forms a salt bridge with Glu-54 in the cAMP-free state, but it forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Ile-60 in the cAMP-bound state. Residues involved in hydrophobic contacts are in green; nitrogen and oxygen atoms are in blue and red, respectively.

observation is in agreement with fluorescence data suggesting that binding of cAMP increases solvent exposure of Trp-85 (13). Displacement of Trp-85 drives the -strand 4/ -strand 5 flap segment toward the C-helix (Fig. 3C), facilitating hydrophobic interactions between Ile-51, Lys-57, Met-59, and Leu-61 within the flap and Phe-136 (which resides at the tip of the extended C-helix) that potentially stabilize the helical conformational state of the Val-126 to Phe-136 segment (Fig. 2D).

Distinct Sets of Interactions Stabilize the Active and Inactive Conformations. A network of newly formed contacts contributes to the

stabilization of the C-helices and the intersubunit C-helix/C helix coiled coil upon binding of cAMP (Fig. 2D). For example, the side-chain amine of Lys-130 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of Ile-60 in CAP-cAMP2, whereas Lys-130 adopts a very different conformation in apo-CAP wherein it forms a salt bridge with Glu-54 located at the flap (Fig. 2D). Thus, disrup-

Dotted lines denote hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide and CAP.

tion of the salt bridge between Glu-54 and Lys-130 upon cAMP binding allows Lys-130 to relocate so as to interact with Ile-60, thereby stabilizing and properly orienting the C-helices, and also releases the strain from the flap region, which, coupled with the displacement of Trp-85 (Fig. 3C), is pushed closer to the C-helix. The new set of interactions established upon cAMP binding brings the D-helix much closer to the C-helix, leading to the formation of an extensive network of interactions between the 2 helices (Fig. 2D): the side chain of Arg-142 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Leu-134 and Leu-137 as well as with the carbonyl oxygen of Val-176 located near the F-helix; the side chain of Asp-138 hydrogen-bonds with the backbone amide of Gly-141; and Glu-129 forms a salt bridge with Lys-152 (6). These interactions result in the repositioning of the DBDs in cAMP2-CAP relative to apo-CAP (Fig. 2 A and C).

Our NMR data reveal that the G141S substitution has dramatic effects both on the structure and on the dynamics of CAP (Fig. 5). (Results for the R142H/A144T substitution are very similar to those for G141S.) The chemical shifts of all DBD residues change significantly and move toward the chemical shift positions in the CAP-cAMP2 complex (Fig. 5B). This observation indicates that the G141S substitution shifts the conformational ensemble toward

effector molecule, binds to CAP but does not stimulate DNA binding by CAP (14, 15), we used NMR to characterize the CAP-cGMP2 complex. The NMR data show that, in contrast to cAMP (Fig. 4A), cGMP does not allosterically alter the conformation of the DBD (Fig. 4B), which remains in the inactive conformation incompatible with DNA-binding. NOE, chemical shift, and relaxation data reveal that the Val-126 to Phe-136 segment remains unstructured in CAP-cGMP2. Thus, in contrast to cAMP, cGMP fails to elicit the coil-to-helix structural transition to the C-helix. To determine the conformation of cGMP in complex with CAP, we used transferred 2D NOE experiments. The NOE data (Fig. S5) reveal that, in contrast to cAMP that binds to CAP in the anti conformation (6), cGMP binds to CAP in the syn conformation (Fig. 4C). Structural modeling based on NMR chemical shift and sparse NOE data (Fig. S5) suggest that cGMP fails to elicit the active conformational state because the cGMP guanine base cannot make key contacts, involving residues Thr-127 and Ser-128, that elicit the coil-tohelix transition in the C-helix (Fig. 4C).

CAP have been isolated that are able to bind to DNA and to activate CAP-dependent promoters in the absence of cAMP (CAP* mutants). Most CAP* mutants involved substitutions located in or close to the hinge region (16, 17), which undergoes major conformational changes during the cAMP-mediated allosteric transition (Fig. 2), and substitutions of Thr-127 and Ser-128 (18), 2 residues that are located within the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil and seem to serve as initiation points for the cAMPmediated coil-to-helix transition.

the active conformation (Fig. 5B). The significant resonance broadening observed for almost all the DBD resonances indicates that the 2 states, active and inactive, interconvert on the micro-tomillisecond ( s-ms) time scale (Fig. 5). Addition of cAMP shifts the population further toward the active conformation with the spectra of CAP-cAMP2 and CAP-G141S-cAMP2 being almost identical (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, whereas cGMP binding to WT CAP has no effect on DBD (Figs. 4B and 5B), cGMP binding to CAP*-G141S seems to activate the CAP* protein further by shifting the equilibrium toward the active state (Fig. 5B), in agreement with

biochemical data (19, 20). Moreover, the pattern and direction of chemical shift changes in the residues located at the unstructured segment of the coiled coil in the CAP* mutant, together with the observed severe exchange broadening, suggest that this region undergoes a coil-to-helix transition in apo-CAP*-G141S. This observation is important, because it indicates that the coil-to-helix transition is a prerequisite for inducing and stabilizing the active conformation of the DBD, even in the absence of cAMP. It is likely that polar substitutions at CAP* sites near the hinge region involve the formation of hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions that cause translation of the D-helix toward the C-helix and rotation of the DBD toward the active conformation. A similar mechanism was observed for a constitutively active mutant of PrfA (21), a structural homologue of CAP. NMR characterization of CAP*-T127L/S128I indicates that the double substitution elicits the active conformational state in the absence of cAMP, albeit with less efficiency than in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 6). The structural basis for the induction of the active conformation by this double mutant seems to be the stabilization of the metastable C-helix/C -helix coiled coil. The intrinsic instability of the C-terminal portion of the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil probably is attributable to the atypical coiled-coil heptadrepeat sequence (Fig. S6A). The atypical presence of polar residues at heptad-repeat positions a and d (i.e., Ser-117 and Thr-127 at positions a and d, respectively), together with the atypical lack of intra- and inter-helical electrostatic interactions between residues at heptad-repeat positions e and g, are likely to reduce coiled-coil stability (22). The single substitution of Thr-127 by Leu, a hydrophobic residue that is particularly favored at position d of the heptad sequence, is not sufficient by itself to stabilize the coiled coil, as judged by NMR analysis of the CAP-T127L mutant (Fig. S6B). NMR chemical shift analysis of CAP*-T127L/S128I suggests that Ile-128 engages in hydrophobic interactions with Ile-51, Met-59, Leu-61, and Leu-73, all located in the cyclic nucleotide-binding module, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the C-helix (Fig. 6A). Therefore, in the absence of inter-helical contacts between residues at positions e and g, interactions between the C-helix and the effector domain seem to be essential for the stabilization of the C-helix/C -helix coiled coil. Discussion We provide atomic details of the cAMP-mediated allosteric transition in CAP, a classic model system for understanding how small molecules effect gene regulation (Fig. 7 and Movie S1). The basic feature of the mechanism is a bistable coiled coil, in which a small-molecule effector determines the balance between the 2 alternative coiled-coil states and in which the 2 alternative coiledcoil states are linked, essentially directly and mechanically, to 2 alternative orientations of a DNA-binding domain. The bistability

Fig. 7. Mechanism of allosteric control of CAP. Schematic models of CAP in the 3 structurally characterized states: apo-CAP (this work), CAP-cAMP2 (6), and CAP-cAMP2-DNA (7). The proposed primary mechanism of allosteric control is clear and simple: cAMP binds to the CBD of CAP and makes direct contacts with Thr-127 and Ser-128. These contacts induce a coil-to-helix transition that extends the C-helix, and the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil, by 3 turns of helix. This coil-to-helix transition results in rotation of the DBDs of the CAP dimer by 60° and translation of the DBDs of the CAP dimer by 7 Å (distance of intersubunit F-helices is 41 Å in apo-CAP and 34 Å, matching the distance between successive DNA major grooves in CAP-cAMP2). This rotation and translation places the F-helices (``recognition helices'') of the DBDs of the CAP dimer in the correct orientation and correct position to interact with successive DNA major grooves.

of the coiled-coil and disorder-order transitions coupled to effector binding permit efficient, precise allosteric control. The results highlight the versatility of the coiled-coil motif both in mediating oligomerization and in functioning as a regulatory switch. The allosteric mechanism proposed herein is consistent with, and accounts for, a large array of biophysical, biochemical, and genetic data (4). The present results provide a framework for understanding and discussing allosteric control of the more than 400 members of the CAP/regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) protein superfamily of transcriptional regulatory factors (23), which share the same overall structural organization as CAP but respond to a broad, chemically diverse, range of allosteric effectors. In carbon monoxide oxidation activator (CooA; effector CO) and o-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase transcription regulator (CprK) (effector ortho-chlorophenolacetic acid), 2 members of the CAP/FNR superfamily for which structural data are available (24­26), the C-helix and the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil seem to be fully structured in the absence of effector. Like CAP, CooA and CprK suffer from irregularities in coiled-coil heptad-repeat sequences. However, in contrast to the situation with CAP, in CooA and CprK, a multitude of interactions between the C-helices and the remainder of the effector domain seem to provide the crucial contacts needed for the coiled-coil stability (24­26). Apparently, the structural mechanisms that allow effectormediated activation of CooA and CprK are distinct and do not involve the coil-to-helix transition seen in CAP. In N-oxide sensing and denitrification transcription factor (DNR; effector NO), a member of the CAP/FNR superfamily for which a structure of the isolated effector-binding domain in the absence of effector is available (27), the C-helix and the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil seem to be partly unstructured in the absence of effector and to extend only to the residue corresponding to Gln-125 in CAP. The striking similarity to CAP in the length of the C-helix and the intersubunit C-helix/C -helix coiled coil in the absence of effector suggests that DNR employs the same mechanism of allosteric

control mechanism as CAP. We anticipate that other members of the CAP/FNR superfamily also use this mechanism. The present results also may provide a framework for understanding and discussing allosteric control of the numerous, functionally diverse, proteins that use cyclic nucleotides as allosteric effectors and conserved cyclic-nucleotide binding domains as allosteric control units (28). This group includes, among many others, protein kinase A (29), guanine nucleotide exchange factors (30), and ion channels that regulate metal ion gating (31). Materials and Methods
Protein Preparation. Isotopically labeled samples for NMR studies were prepared as detailed in SI Text. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR experiments were performed on Varian 900-, 800-, and 600-MHz and Bruker 700-MHz spectrometers. Backbone and side-chain assignment of apo-CAP was achieved using triple-resonance pulse sequences optimized for large proteins (32). NOEs were measured using 2D, 3D, and 4D NOESY using mixing times of 70 ms for protonated samples and 150 ­300 ms for deuterated samples. The structure of cGMP bound to CAP was determined using 2D transferred NOE spectroscopy with a mixing time of 100 ms. Concentration of cGMP was 1 mM, whereas concentration of CAP was 50 M. 1H-15N NOE data were obtained as described previously (33). All NMR samples were prepared in 50 mM KPi (pH 6.0), 500 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM DTT, and 1 g l 1 NaN3. Concentration was 0.6 ­ 0.8 mM. His-tagged and non His-tagged CAP samples provided essentially identical spectra. Spectra were recorded at 32 °C. PRE (9, 34) and RDC data were collected and analyzed as detailed in SI Text. Structure Calculation. Structure calculations were performed with CNS software (35) as detailed in SI Text. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
