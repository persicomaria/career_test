Chrysospermin C is a 19-residue peptaibol capable of forming transmembrane ion channels in phospholipid bilayers. The conformation of chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles has been solved using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Selective 15N-labeling and 13C-labeling of specific a-aminoisobutyric acid residues was used to obtain complete stereospecific assignments for all eight a-aminoisobutyric acid residues. Structures were calculated using 339 distance constraints and 40 angle constraints obtained from NMR data. The Ê NMR structures superimpose with mean global rmsd values to the mean structure of 0.27 A (backbone heavy Ê (all heavy atoms). Chrysospermin C bound to decylphosphocholine micelles displays two atoms) and 0.42 A well-defined helices at the N-terminus (residues Phe1-Aib9) and C-terminus (Aib13-Trp-ol19). A slight bend preceding Pro14, i.e. encompassing residues 10±12, results in an angle of < 388 between the mean axes of the two helical regions. The bend structure observed for chrysospermin C is compatible with the sequences of all 18 long peptaibols and may represent a common `active' conformation. The structure of chrysospermin C shows clear hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces which would be appropriate for the formation of oligomeric ion channels. Keywords: chrysospermin C; ion channel; micelle; NMR; peptaibol. Chrysospermin C is a 19-residue peptaibol [1] which has been isolated from the fungus Apiocrea chrysosperma [2]. It displays antibacterial, fungicidal and highly nematocidic properties which are attributed to its ability to form oligomeric ion channels [3]. In contrast to voltage-gated peptaibols such as alamethicin, chrysospermin channel activity is observed for salt concentration gradients with no electrical potential applied across the bilayer [3]. This observation suggests that chrysospermin C can adopt its active conformation without a transmembrane voltage, which offers substantial advantages for structural studies of the channel-forming conformation. As with other peptaibols, chrysospermin C has a high content of Ca-methyl substituted a-amino acids such as a-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and d-isovaline (d-Iva), several of which are strongly conserved in the amino-acid sequences of long peptaibols. Although the amino-acid sequences of a substantial number of peptaibols are now known, it has been difficult to relate these sequences to differences in channel properties. These observations prompted us to investigate whether the structural properties of chrysospermin C can offer further insights into functional differences among the various peptaibols. In a previous NMR study of chrysospermin C [4], we reported the use of a chemically synthesized molecule with

selected 13C-isotope and 15N-isotope labels for Aib residues 9, 10 and 13 (15N H and 13C H ), as well as for Aib residues 15±17 (13Cb). Use of the labeled molecule allowed complete, sequence specific 1H-assignments and 13C-assignments to be obtained and also allowed the measurement of structurally important heteronuclear coupling constants in the peptide backbone in methanol. This study resulted in the most complete constraint set available to date for a peptaibol, but clearly demonstrated that although chrysospermin C showed a propensity to adopt helical conformations in methanol, it was in rapid equilibrium with nonhelical structures [4]. Because this suggested that a membrane or membrane-like environment is probably a prerequisite for formation of a stably folded conformation of chrysospermin C, we extended our previous work to study chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles. Although micelles are not a perfect mimic of lipid bilayers, a substantial number of structural determinations for peptides and proteins bound to micelles have indicated that valuable structural information can be obtained from NMR studies of such systems [5±15].

The synthesis of the specifically labeled peptide has been described previously [4]. Unlabeled material was a gift È È from H.-J. Dornberger (Hans-Knoll-Institut fur NaturstoffForschung, Jena, Germany) [2]. Perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine was synthesized as reported previously [5]. The micelle samples were prepared by co-dissolving the peptide with deuterated dodecylphosphocholine in methanol at a molar ratio of 1:50, drying in a Speedvac lyophilizer, and repeated drying from H2O. After dissolution in water for the third time, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 and 6% D2O was added. Samples containing unlabeled chrysospermin C (6 mm) or the selectively labeled peptide (4.3 mm) were used for the NMR measurements. Preliminary NMR experiments indicated that at

these peptide/dodecylphosphocholine ratios the peptide is monomeric as no further change in the NMR spectrum was observed for peptide/dodecylphosphocholine ratios up to 1 : 100. Previous NMR structure determinations of peptides in lipid micelles were carried out at temperatures between 25 and 40 8C [5±15]. There was very little variation in the NMR spectrum of chrysospermin C over 25±50 8C and a temperature of 45 8C, which resulted in an average amide line width of 8.6 Hz, was therefore used in all experiments. The association of the peptide with the micelles is ensured by the fact that chrysospermin itself is not water soluble [2]. Unless stated otherwise, all NMR experiments on chrysospermin C in dodecylphosphocholine micelles were performed on a 600-MHz Varian Unity Plus spectrometer. Two-dimensional spectra were processed with the Varian software vnmr, converted into xeasy-readable format and baseline corrected using the `cflatt' [16] procedure of the program prosa [17]. Analysis of the NMR spectra was carried out using the program xeasy [18]. In addition to the DQF-COSY [19], TOCSY [20] and NOESY [21] spectra for the assignment of 1H-frequencies, heteronuclear one-bond and long-range correlation spectra were recorded for both the unlabeled and the selectively labeled samples to obtain assignments of the Aib residues and the aromatic side-chains of Phe1 and tryptophanol (Trp-ol)19. A heteronuclear TOCSY sequence [22±24] was tuned to observe either one-bond or long-range correlations. In addition, to observing long-range connections over the entire spectral range, a conventional heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiment was carried out. 15N-filtered and 13C-filtered NOESY spectra [25±27], as well as a 12 13 C/ C-filtered NOESY spectrum [28], were recorded for the labeled peptide to facilitate assignment of cross peaks in overlapped regions of the NOESY spectrum. 1H-chemical shifts are reported relative to external sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) propane-1-sulfonate, whereas 13C-shifts were referenced indirectly using the frequency ratio determined in Wishart et al. [29]. Quantitative NOE constraints for the chrysospermin C/dodecylphosphocholine micelle complex (Mr < 20 kDa) were derived from the 50 and 100 ms NOESY spectra. Intensities from 15 N-filtered and 13C-filtered spectra were scaled to those of the homonuclear spectrum and transformed into distance constraints using the program caliba [30]. The 12C/13Cspectrum was used for assignment purposes. Additional NOEs that appeared in the 100-ms NOESY spectrum were introduced Ê into the calculation only as upper limit constraints . 5.0 A to allow for possible contributions by spin diffusion effects. For methyl groups the uniform average model was used [6]. In the final calculation, the hydrogen bond between O H 9HN , 13 which was observed in a two-dimensional H(N)CO experiment [31,32], was included through an upper limit constraint of Ê 2.0 A. 3 JHNHa coupling constants were determined using the program infit [33] from NOESY or TOCSY cross peaks. 3J 3 HNCb and JHNC H were measured as described previously [4]. The 3 J coupling constants and the distance constraints were subjected to a local conformational analysis with the found algorithm [34] and to distance geometry calculations with the program dyana [35]. The Karplus parametrizations of Wang & Bax [36] were used to derive angle constraints from the coupling constants. Energy minimization was performed with the program opal [37]. Because chrysospermin C contains the unusual amino acids Aib, d-Iva and tryptophanol, new entries in the residue library for the local conformational analysis with

found and for the structure calculation with dyana were created on the basis of X-ray crystallographic data [38,39]. The entries to the dyana residue library are available from the authors.

NMR assignments Initial inspection of the NMR data revealed significiant differences in chemical shifts for chrysospermin C in methanol and bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles, indicating that new assignments had to be carried out. Complete sequential assignment of the spin systems was based on amide dNN(i,i 1 1) cross peaks and confirmed by Ha/amide daN(i,i 1 1) as well as side-chain/amide dbN(i,i 1 1) connectivities in a NOESY spectrum (Fig. 1A). 1H assignments for all l-amino acids could then be obtained from the DQF-COSY/ TOCSY spin system patterns by utilizing the conventional È approach of Wuthrich [40]. A combination of heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) and HMBC experiments was used to obtain assignments for the aromatic side-chains of Phe1 and Trp-ol19. In most previous NMR studies of peptaibols it has proven difficult to obtain complete assignments for the methyl groups

of the Aib residues. We used a similar strategy to that presented previously for chrysospermin C in methanol [4] to obtain complete assignments of the Aib methyls for chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles. For unlabeled chrysospermin C, a one-bond C-H correlation experiment showed that all 16 methyl groups of the eight Aib residues were resolved individually and revealed the characteristic separation into two groups with 13C chemical shifts in the ranges 24.5±27.0 p.p.m. and 28.0±30.5 p.p.m. (Fig. 2A). An HMBC experiment allowed the correlation of two Hb to the C H of the same residue to be clearly observed for Aib residues 2, 4, 9, 10, 13 and 16 (Fig. 2E, the seqential assignments are described below). For Aib residues 15 and 17, the almost degenerate 1H chemical shifts of the two methyl groups (Fig. 2A) made unambiguous interpretation of the HMBC spectrum difficult (Fig. 2E). For Aib residues 15, 16 and 17, which have 13Cb in the isotope labeled peptide, the corresponding six methyl groups were identified by a one-bond C-H correlation experiment (Fig. 2B). Sequential assignment of these residues, as well as verification of the pairs of methyl groups corresponding to Aib15 and Aib17, was then obtained from Cb1 to HN correlations (Fig. 2C) and Cb2 to HN correlations (Fig. 2D) within the same residue. Similarly, for Aib residues 9, 10 and 13, which have 15N H and 13C H in the isotope labeled peptide, an HMBC spectrum allowed

correlation of Hb to C H of the same residue to be observed for all six methyl groups (Fig. 2F). Sequential assignments were then obtained from correlations of C H to HN of the same and following residue (Fig. 2G, interrupted for Pro14). For the remaining Aib residues 2 and 4, the pairs of methyl groups (Fig. 2E) were assigned sequentially by 1H NOE signals. Qualitative characterization of the chrysospermin conformation Previous measurements of 3JHNHa coupling constants for the l-amino-acid residues 1, 3, 5, 7, 12 and 18 of 3JHNCb values for Aib15, Aib16 and Aib17 and of 3JHNC H coupling constants for Aib9, Aib10 and Aib13 were consistent with left-handed or right-handed helical conformations [4]. The NOE spectra are consistent with this, showing, for example (Fig. 1A), the daN(i,i 1 2) and daN(i,i 1 3) NOEs typical of helical conformations [40]. The chemical shift index method introduced by Wishart and colleagues [41,42] provides further evidence because, with the exception of Ala12, all the Ha resonances of the l-amino acids show the high field chemical shift characteristic of helical conformations (Fig. 1B). To analyze for 310-helices or a-helices in the conformation of chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles, we compared different short-range distances expected for the

sequence of chrysospermin C in these two helical conformations (Table 1). Only limited differences in the pattern of short-range distances are expected between an a-helix and a 310-helix [40,43]. Significant differences in the daN(i,i 1 2) distances would be expected to lead to observable differences in the NOE intensities of these resonances for 310-helices or a-helices. Furthermore, daN(i,i 1 4) is Ê Ê # 4.2 A for a-helices, but . 6 A for 310-helices, indicating that these types of NOE resonance should only be observed in a-helices. This relationship also holds true for the respective distances db2N(i,i 1 2) and db2N(i,i 1 4) when Ha is replaced by Cb2 in Aib or Iva residues (Table 1). In addition, differences between dab1(i,i 1 2) and dab1(i,i 1 3), or the corresponding db2b1(i,i 1 2) and db2b1(i,i 1 3) when Ha is replaced by Cb2 in Aib or Iva residues, should give distinguishable differences in the relative intensities of the corresponding NOE cross peaks between 310-helices or a-helices (Table 1). Although not all such NOE cross peaks could be assigned unambiguously because of spectral overlap, the NOE patterns observed for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of chrysospermin C were qualitatively characteristic of a-helices [see for example daN(i,i 1 4) in Fig. 1]. In the central region of the chrysospermin C sequence, because of the 15 N H , 13 C H labeling of Aib residues 9, 10 and 13, direct evidence for a O H 9HN (a-helix) rather than a O H 10HN 13 13 (310-helix) hydrogen bond was obtained through direct 3h detection of the JN H C H trans-hydrogen bond scalar coupling in a two-dimensional H(N)CO experiment (Fig. 3). To check for the formation of other hydrogen bonds, the exchange of the labile amide hydrogens with the solvent was followed by a series of one-dimensional NMR experiments at 40 8C in time intervals of 9, 12, 20, 30, 60, 90, 180 and 360 min after addition of D2O to a lyophilized sample of chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles. The measured exchange rates are shown in Fig. 1C. Except near the N-terminus and for Gly8 and Aib9, all backbone amides show substantial reductions in the rate of hydrogen exchange, which is consistent with reduced solvent accessibility caused by hydrogen bond formation or possibly by reduced solvent access in the hydrophobic interior of the micelle. The faster exchange of Phe1 to Aib4 is expected due to the lack of hydrogen bonding partners at the N-terminus of the peptaibol sequence. Perhaps most interesting is that the

Intra-residual, three-bond 13C H -HN correlation peaks for Aib9, Aib10 and Aib13, as well as the two-bond interresidual correlation peak between C H of Aib9 and HN of Aib10 are shown. A cross peak attributable to a hydrogen bond between HN of Aib13 and O H of Aib9 is observed which is absent in a control experiment with a shorter dephasing delay [31].

Aib residues immediately following Pro14 all show slow exchange rates, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds spanning Pro14. Stereospecific assignments of Aib residues A major problem in previous NMR structure determinations for peptaibols has been the difficulty in obtaining stereospecific, sequential assignments for the two methyl groups of the usually large number of Aib residues. Stereospecific assignments were particularly critical for calculating the structure of chrysospermin C because for the nine residues 9±17, six are Aib residues. A critical component of our success in obtaining stereospecific assignments for all Aib residues was the use of the new program found [34], which allows the exhaustive variation of large numbers of torsion angles in local conformational searches. The observation of NOE signals between Pro14 Hd and Aib13 HN and b-protons was indicative for a trans-proline configuration and a preliminary local conformational analysis based on a cis-proline, which is known to induce helix-turn-helix motifs in peptides [44], revealed that no conformations involving a cis-peptide bond were compatible with the experimental data. After assuming that all peptide bonds were in trans conformations, a systematic conformational search over all fragments of five residues (e.g. Aib10 to Pro14 or Aib13 to Aib17) using the program found entailed systematic variation of 9±12 torsion angles (5 f, 4c, 0±3 x1) because no variation of Gly, Ala, Pro or Aib side-chain torsion angles was required. This grid search revealed that only right-handed helical conformations were consistent with the NMR data. Thus, even though the sequence of residues 9±17 of chrysospermin C includes only three chiral l-amino acids, the NMR data were adequate to establish unambiguously a right-handed helical conformation. Using found, dyana [34,35] and the ancillary program glomsa [30] in several cycles of structural calculations, stereospecific assignments for 74% of all diastereotopic groups,

including the methyl groups of all eight Aib residues, were established. As observed previously for chrysospermin C in methanol [4], for seven of the eight Aib residues, the chemical shift of the pro-R 13Cb1 lay in the range 28.7±29.8 p.p.m., whereas the pro-S 13Cb2 chemical shift lay between 24.8 and 25.7 p.p.m.. The exception was Aib13. This confirms earlier suggestions that stereospecific assignments of the methyl groups of Aib residues can be ascertained from the Cb chemical shifts [4,45] except in the case of Aib-Pro sequences, where the stereospecific assignment is reversed. Structure calculations From a total of 448 NOE cross peaks assigned in the NOESY spectra, 339 meaningful distance constraints were derived. These were supplemented with 17 3J coupling constants and submitted to a local conformational analysis resulting in additional constraints for 40 torsion angles (18 f, 18 c, 2 x1, 2 x2). Only one hydrogen bond constraint between O H 9HN , as 13 detected in the two-dimensional H(N)CO experiment (Fig. 3), was included in the constraint list. The final structural computations were performed with 100 random starting conformers. The 20 structures with the lowest dyana target functions were subjected to energy minimization and used to characterize the conformation of chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles. These structures showed small target functions and energies and no significant violation of the input constraints (Table 2). Figure 4A depicts the distribution of the torsion angles for the best 20 conformers. All backbone torsion angles occupied standard negative values in the allowed regions of Ramachandran plots. Description of the chrysospermin C conformation The calculated structures indicate that in a micellar environment chrysospermin C adopts helical structures for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions that are interrupted by a bend preceding Pro14 (Fig. 5). The N-terminal residues

Phe1-Aib9, plus the acetylated N-terminus, form a largely regular a-helix which shows a mean rmsd of the atomic Ê displacements relative to the mean structure of 0.07 A (backÊ bone heavy atoms) or 0.35 A (all heavy atoms). This part of the structure is well defined and includes many of the OiH N i+4 hydrogen bonds expected for an a-helix (Fig. 4B). A bifurcated Phe1 O H -HN Aib4 and Phe1 O H -HN Iva5 hydrogen bond is also observed. For the amide NH groups of Aib4, Gln7 and Gly8, alternative hydrogen bonding schemes, i.e. OiH N or i+3 OiH N or bifurcation (Fig. 4C), could not be distinguished i+4 reliably using the present data. A slight distortion of the backbone torsion angles at Ser3, Aib4 avoids unfavorable Aib2 Cb2H3 to Iva5 Cb1H3 steric interactions. The C-terminal region Aib13 to Trp-ol19 forms a further helix which is also well Ê defined with rmsd values of 0.10 A (backbone heavy atoms) Ê and 0.22 A (all heavy atoms). OiH N hydrogen bonds were i+4 observed for the amide groups of Aib16 to Gln18, whereas an OiH N hydrogen bond was found for Trp-ol19 i+3 (Fig. 4B). For HN Gln18 a bifurcated hydrogen bond may also occur (Fig. 4C). The H/D exchange behavior (Fig. 1C) is consistent with the formation of an extended hydrogen bonding pattern for the helical conformations in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The central portion of the sequence (residues 10±12) containing the juncture between the helices adopts a conformation that leads to a bend with an angle of < 388 (30.78250.18) between the axes of the N-terminal and C-terminal helices. The conformation of the bend is determined by a substantial number of NOEs (Fig. 5C). Although many of the experimental NMR constraints involve NOEs to methyl groups, even with a very conservative

interpretation of such NOEs [6], the bend conformation is well defined with, for example, essentially the same hydrogen bond pattern observed in all structures (Fig. 4B). Residues 8±14 superimpose with a rmsd of the atomic Ê Ê coordinates of 0.10 A (backbone heavy atoms) and 0.13 A (all heavy atoms). The observed bend results from small, concerted torsion angle deviations from the ideal a-helical backbone values between Aib10 and Aib13, with the strongest contribution stemming from f of Ala12. The bent structure of chrysospermin has the hydrogen bonding pattern of a Ê 310-helix at O H 9H N and results in a total length of 24.8±26.2 A 12 a a (C /C ) for the 20 best conformers of chrysospermin C. This Ê Ê can be compared with lengths of 26.7 A or 34.3 A for regular a-helices or 310-helices containing 19 amino-acid residues, respectively. The surface of chrysospermin C is clearly divided into two faces which differ in hydrophobicity with the two strongest hydrophilic patches contributed by the glutamine 7, 18 sidechains (Fig. 5B). The side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser3 and the carbonyl oxygens of Aib4 and the N-acetyl group extend the hydrophilic surface to the N-terminus. At the center of the molecule, the hydrophilic surface results from contributions of backbone amides (Gly8, Ala11, Aib15) and carbonyl oxygens (e.g. Aib10, Ala11, Pro14) (Fig. 5). The more hydrophobic surface, which is dominated by the aromatic side-chains of Phe1 and Trp-ol19 as well as Iva5, exhibits a pronounced concave shape. For the central portion of the molecular surface, the hydrophobic surface is predominantly determined by contributions of the Aib and alanine methyl groups (Aib9, Ala12, Aib13, Aib16).

DISCUSSION
Although peptaibols have now been studied for more than 20 years, there is still no good atomic-level description of the relationship between the molecular structure and conductance properties of the ion channel for any peptaibol. This is largely because of the difficulty in obtaining structural data at atomic resolution for peptaibols in their active, membrane-bound conformation using either X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Evidence that, dependent upon the molecular environment, peptaibols can adopt slightly different conformations, particularly in the central bend region, is explicit from some of the X-ray data, e.g. the multiple conformations observed in alamethicin crystals [46]. Lipid environments are utilized more easily in NMR studies, nevertheless structure determinations for peptaibols remain a challenge for liquid state NMR methods. Despite their low molecular mass, distinctions between a-helices and 310-helices, as well as the accurate determination of bend conformations in nonglobular structures, requires very extensive NMR data and careful measurement and calibration of NOE intensities (Table 1). Although stereospecific assignment of all of the methyl groups of the usually large numbers of Aib residues is essential, only two previous NMR studies of a peptaibol have reported such assignments [4,47]. In short, the present data provide an opportunity to evaluate the degree to which the NMR methods employed are

capable of giving highly accurate descriptions of a peptaibol structure. In particular, even with the high precision of the present structures, not all hydrogen bonds in the helical regions (and hence a-helical or 310-helical structural features) could be identified definitively. This might reflect intermediate structures, e.g. bifurcated OiH N and OiH N hydrogen bonds i+3 i+4 are also observed in the crystal structure of alamethicin [46], but part of the difficulty is that over 40% of the medium range backbone NOEs involve Aib methyl groups (Fig. 1) and that the internal rotation of methyl groups requires a very conservative interpretation of these NOE intensities [6]. The present demonstration that 3hJN H C H trans-hydrogen bond scalar couplings can be observed in 15 N,13 C-labeled peptaibol/micelle complexes with a molecular mass of < 20 kDa, which provides definitive identification of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups [31,32], will be an important feature for future refinement of peptaibol structures by NMR methods provided that full 13 C,15 N labeling in fungal cultures can be achieved [8]. Despite these caveats, which involve very small variations in backbone torsion angles (Fig. 4A), the present high precision structure of chrysospermin C provides important insights into possible mechanisms of ion channel formation. The structure of chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles is consistent with qualitative expectations for a peptide with its sequence. In particular, it is known that Aib residues favor local helical conformations

due to steric hindrances [48,49]. While strings of four Aib residues have been shown to favor formation of 310-helices [50], the critical barrier to the formation of a-helices seems to be the location of Aib residues at residues i and i 1 3 because this results in van der Waals overlaps of the Aib methyl groups in a regular a-helix. The location, if not the exact structure, of the bend region is therefore consistent with expectations because the methyl groups of Aib10±Aib13 and Aib13±Aib16 of chrysospermin C would experience van der Waals contacts in a regular a-helix. The bend structure at residues 10±13 allows for the relief of unfavorable Aib10±Aib13 steric interactions. The observed bend location is also consistent with the sequence position of Pro14 because proline (or hydroxyproline) is known to induce kinks or turns in helices due to the disturbance of the hydrogen bonding pattern as well as by steric hindrance. Although the backbone torsion angles remain close to an ideal a-helix, the inclusion of Pro14 within the sequence Aib13-Aib16 leads to an increase in the Ê Aib13 Cb2 ±Cb1 Aib16 distance from < 3.0 A (ideal helix) to Ê 4.0±4.6 A. The structure determined for chrysospermin C is well adapted to the formation of an oligomeric, transmembrane Ê ion channel. With a length of < 25±26 A, the molecule is an appropriate length to span the hydrophobic region of a bilayer membrane [51]. It contains aromatic amino acids at both ends of the sequence (Phe1 and Trp-ol19) which may be important in anchoring the ends of the molecule in the interfacial region of the membrane surface. The few hydrophilic residues of chrysospermin C align at one side of the structure facilitating their orientation towards the center of an oligomeric bundle. This side of the molecule displays an elongated, continuous hydrophilic surface (Fig. 5B) which would be consistent with the formation of a pore through the entire thickness of the bilayer in an oligomeric bundle. In this respect it is interesting that it is the convex surface of the chrysospermin C molecule which shows the higher hydrophilicity, suggesting that a funnelshaped pore might be formed. This is reminiscent of computed models for pore formation by alamethicin [52,53] and of the tetrameric `hour glass' X-ray structure reported recently for the

shorter peptaibol antiamoebin [54,55]. It should also be noted that the two Gln residues of chrysospermin C play a critical role in defining the most hydrophilic surface, that Gln7 and Glu/Gln18 are also strongly conserved in long peptaibols (Table 3) and that Gln7 was recently shown to be essential for sustaining high conductance levels for alamethicin channels [56]. In the context of the above considerations, it is interesting to note that for all peptaibols with $ 18 amino acids, i.e. for sequences that are long enough to span a typical lipid bilayer, Aib10, Aib13, Pro14 and Aib16 are strongly conserved (Table 3). In addition, residue 11 always corresponds to a small side-chain (Gly, Ala or Ser). This avoids a large sidechain in the middle of the hydrophilic strip and might also be important for intermolecular packing in an oligomeric ion channel. For the 18 different long peptaibols shown in Table 3, all seven of the different sequences for residues 10±16 could adopt the bend structure observed for chrysospermin C, suggesting that this bend might represent a common `active' conformation for long peptaibols. Among the long peptaibols, atomic coordinates are currently available only for chrysospermin C in dodecylphosphocholine micelles in solution and for alamethicin in pure peptide crystals. Both of these peptaibols show an accumulation of small deviations from backbone a-helical torsion angles preceding a proline residue in the central region of the molecule, which leads to a bent overall structure. For alamethicin, the crystal structure shows three slightly different structures, with bend angles ranging from 148 to 288, and small changes in the hydrogen bond patterns of the central bend region. For this region of the respective molecules (residues 8±14) the rmsd displacements (for the backbone atoms) between chrysospermin C and the Ê alamethicin conformations are 0.43, 0.47 and 0.44 A, respectively, i.e. the conformations are similar to the structure observed for chrysospermin C in terms of bend angle and atomic coordinates [46]. Recently, a NMR solution structure in SDS micelles for trichorzianin A VII, another long peptaibol which forms voltage-dependent channels, has been reported [9]. Two structural families exhibiting a bend angle of 90±1008

between two well-defined N-terminal and C-terminal righthanded a-helices were found [9]. With this bend angle, a single molecule could not span a membrane bilayer. The difference in conformation relative to chrysospermin C and alamethicin might be related to the fact that SDS is not as good a membrane mimetic as dodecylphosphocholine [57] or to the possibility that a conformation more appropriate to initial insertion of the peptide into the membrane, rather than to channel formation, has been observed under the experimental conditions used. Finally, for the C-terminal sequence, an a-helix has been observed for chrysospermin C, whereas the alamethicin crystal structures show both helix types suggesting that either helical form or even intermediate forms are possible for long peptaibols depending on the exact amino-acid sequence and perhaps also on the nature of the molecular environment. Similarly, many of the other long peptaibols, including chrysospermins A and B, contain Aib(i )±Aib(i 1 3) and Aib(i )±Ala(i 1 3) sequences in the N±terminus, which suggests that the largely regular a-helix seen at the N-terminus of chrysospermin C may not be a feature of all long peptaibols. In contrast to the chrysospermins, alamethicin, the most widely studied peptaibol, requires a gating voltage in order to form active channels [58]. There has been considerable recent investigation and discussion concerning possible gating mechanisms, the most popular proposals being that the gating voltage is required for transmembrane insertion of alamethicin [46] or that the gating voltage is required for conformational rearrangment of alamethicin molecules that are already in a transmembrane orientation to form an active channel [59]. In connection with the latter proposal, evidence for internal mobility in the bend region of alamethicin has been reported [59±62]. The most convincing evidence for conformational variability in the bend region was obtained by 15N relaxation measurements for alamethicin bound to SDS micelles, which showed lower order parameters than expected and observed for helices in proteins and only minimal differences in the order parameters between alamethicin in methanol and bound to SDS micelles [62]. Unfortunately, the NMR studies for alamethicin in methanol or bound to deuterated SDS micelles resulted in rather limited NMR constraint sets [11,47], primarily because of the lack of complete stereospecific, sequential assignments of the Aib residues. The conformational/dynamic characteristics of a putative kink region of alamethicin therefore remain an open question. In contrast, binding of chrysospermin C to dodecylphosphocholine micelles results in a well-defined conformation with no obvious evidence of structural variability near the bend region. Indeed, the observation of trans-hydrogen bond scalar couplings between Aib9 and Aib13 almost completely excludes a high population of dynamically rearranged conformations in the central part of chrysospermin C bound to dodecylphosphocholine micelles. Thus, the hypothesis that alamethicin requires a gating voltage to achieve a necessary variation of its internal conformation, whereas chrysospermin C already adopts its active conformation in the absence of a gating voltage, cannot be excluded at present. To test whether the bend conformation of chrysospermin C is maintained in other bilayer models, we are currently investigating the structure of chrysospermin C in bicelles. Alternatively, there may be a difference in the insertion/transmembrane orientation between chrysospermin C and alamethicin in the absence of a transmembrane voltage. For this reason we are currently using solid-state NMR experiments to investigate the orientation of chrysospermin C bound to lipid bilayers.
