Abstract This is the Wrst crystal structure of a carbohydrate induced dimer of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). This is an endogenous complex formed between two PLA2 molecules and two mannoses. It was isolated from Krait venom (Bungarus caeruleus) and crystallized as such. The complete amino acid sequence of PLA2 was determined using cDNA method. Three-dimensional structure of the complex has been solved with molecular replacement method and reWned to a Wnal R-factor of 0.192 for all the data in the resolution range 20.0­2.1 Å. The presence of mannose molecules in the protein crystals was conWrmed using dinitrosalicylic acid test and the molecular weight of the dimer was veriWed with MALDI-TOF. As indicated by dynamic light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation the dimer was also stable in solution. The good quality non-protein electron density at the interface of two PLA2 molecules enabled us to model two mannoses. The mannoses are involved extensively in interactions with protein atoms of both PLA2 molecules. Some of the critical amino acid residues such as Asp 49 and Tyr 31, which are part of the substrate-binding site, are found facing the interface and interacting with mannoses. The structure of the complex clearly shows that the dimerization is caused by mannoses and it results in the loss of enzymatic activity.  2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Phospholipase A2 (PLA2)1 [E.C. 3.1.1.4] hydrolyzes the sn-2 ester bond of phosphoglycerides, generating lysophospholipids and fatty acids (van Deenen and de Haas, 1963). Several diVerent classes of PLA2s have been reported in recent years (Dennis, 1997; Six and Dennis,

2000), although only groups I and II PLA2s have been studied well. There has been immense interest to design inhibitors against these classes of secretory PLA2s. The group I PLA2s are secreted from pancreas gland (Dijkstra et al., 1981, 1983) while group II PLA2s are present in synovial Xuid (Kramer et al., 1989). The PLA2s belonging to groups I and II have also been found in large quantities in the venoms of various snakes (Arni et al., 1999; Carredano et al., 1998; Dijkstra et al., 1981, 1983; Fremont et al., 1993; Holland et al., 1990; Han et al., 1997; Keith et al., 1981; Kwong et al., 1995; Perbandt et al., 1997; Tang et al., 1998; Westerlund et al., 1992; White et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 1998). In snake venoms these enzymes exist in various oligomeric states such as monomers, dimers, and trimers

(Roberts et al., 1978). It has been often observed that the PLA2s tend to lose their catalytic activity when oligomerized (Fremont et al., 1993; Segelke et al., 1998). The oligomerization of PLA2 may be caused by a number of factors such as its own amino acid sequence, ligands such as metal ions and various other chemical entities. To understand the nature of binding of various naturally occurring ligands to PLA2 and for identifying new interactions that might be important in molecular recognition, the structure of an endogenously formed complex between two molecules of PLA2 and two mannoses has been determined. The complex was isolated from the venom of Krait (Bungarus caeruleus). The snake venom has been reported to contain carbohydrates such as mannose and fucose (Devi, 1968).

although it showed no enzymatic activity. It was further fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 column (100 £ 1 cm) with 0.1 M ammonium acetate, pH 5.0 at 277 K. The Xow rate was maintained at 6 ml/h and 5 ml fractions were collected. The major fraction was pooled and lyophilized. The molecular weight of the fraction was estimated to be between 25 and 28 kDa from the void volume. The purity was checked on sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE), which showed a single band with a molecular weight of 13 kDa indicating the presence of a possible dimer. Its molecular weight was also estimated with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of Xight (MALDI-TOF) which indicated two peaks, one at 26.3 kDa and another at 13.1 kDa indicating the presence of a dimer and a monomer under MALDI-TOF conditions. 2.2. Dynamic light scattering The puriWed and lyophilized sample of the protein was dissolved in freshly prepared Tris­HCl buVer at pH 8.0. The samples were Wltered through 0.1 m polyvinylidene diXuoride Wlters (Millipore). The enzyme concentration used was 10 mg/ml. Samples were manually injected into a Xow cell (30 l) and illuminated by 30 mW, 660 nm laser diode. 2.3. Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation measurements were carried out using a Beckman Model XL analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman­Coulter, USA) with two sector centerpieces. The data were collected at 230 nm. Sedimentation velocity analyses were performed at 50,000 rpm at 20 °C with a protein concentration of 500 g/ml. The data were analyzed using Optima XL-A/XL-I Data analysis Software (version 6.03, Beckman). 2.4. Dinitrosalicylic acid test Protein crystals (see Section 2.6) were dissolved in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Aliquots of this solution ranging from 50 to 500 l were diluted to 2.0 ml with the buVer and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. One milliliter of dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) solution was added to each of them. The samples were boiled for 15 min and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. After cooling the supernatant, each sample was analyzed spectrophotometrically at 540 nm which conWrmed the presence of sugar (Miller, 1959).

2. Materials and methods 2.1. PuriWcation of PLA2 The lyophilized venom of B. caeruleus was obtained from Irula cooperative snake farm, Tamilnadu, India and puriWed as reported earlier (Singh et al., 2001). One gram of venom was dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 50 mg/ml. This was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was applied to a cation exchanger, CM-Sephadex C-25 (60 £ 1 cm), which had been equilibrated with 0.05 M ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, at 277 K. Proteins adsorbed on the column were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.05 M, pH 5.0 to 0.5 M, pH 7.0 of ammonium acetate. The Xow rate was maintained at 6 ml/h and 25 fractions of 5 ml each were collected. A total of 11 distinct peaks corresponding to diVerent isoforms of Krait PLA2 were observed (Fig. 1). The N-terminal sequence of the Wrst 15 residues of fraction VIII indicated the presence of PLA2,

The Xow rate was maintained at 6 ml/h and 5 ml fractions were collected. The fractions of peak VIII were pooled, further puriWed, and crystallized.

2.5. MALDI-TOF of the samples from crystals The mass spectrometric analysis was performed on washed protein crystals with MALDI-TOF instrument (KRATOS analytical, Shimadzu, Japan). Crystals of

PLA2 were dissolved in distilled water (approximately 10 mg/ml). Prior to the acquisition of spectra, 100 l of PLA2 solution was mixed with 100 l of 0.2% aqueous triXuoroacetic acid. One microliter of the acidiWed solution was then spotted onto a stainless steel sample slide followed by 1 ml of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) matrix solution (10 mg/ml in 50:50 ethanol/water containing 0.1% triXuoroacetic acid). 2.6. Sequence determination The venom glands of B. caeruleus were obtained from Irula cooperative snake farm, Tamilnadu, India with the permission of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Prior to use the minced glands were stored in guanidine isothiocyanate (4 M) solution at ¡70 °C. The tissues were homogenized using polytron (Kinematica, Switzerland) homogenizer. The total RNA was extracted with equal volume of phenol­chloroform (1:1) mixture. QuantiWcation of RNA was done spectrophotometrically. Ten micrograms of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Revert Aid M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentes, Lithuania) and oligo(dT)18 primer (MBI Fermentes, Lithuania). The conserved nucleotide sequences of group I PLA2s were used for construction of primers. The oligonucleotides 5 AAA TGT ATC CTG CTC ACC TTC T 3 and 5 GCT GAA GCC TCT CAA ATA TCA T 3 were used as forward and reverse primers, respec-

tively, in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliWcation using PTC 100 thermocycler (MJ Research, USA). The ampliWed product of 464 bp was cloned in pGEMT (Promega) vector. The automated DNA sequencing of the insert was performed using ABI-377 sequencer. Both strands were sequenced. The cDNA reported here comprises an ORF encoding 147 amino acids and a 3 UTR of 18 bp. The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences are given in Fig. 2. The nucleotide sequence has been deposited in GenBank with code AY455755.

2.7. Crystallization of PLA2 Crystals of PLA2 were obtained using sitting-drop vapor diVusion method. The protein was dissolved at 7 mg/ml concentration in 50 mM Tris­HCl buVer, pH 8.5, containing 1.4 M NaCl, 1 mM NaN3. It was equilibrated against the same buVer containing 2.8 M NaCl. After 3 days of incubation at 8 °C, crystals had grown to about 0.20 £ 0.15 £ 0.10 mm3 in size.

2.8. Data collection The X-ray intensity data were collected at DESY, Hamburg using consortium beam line X13. The crystals were Xash frozen at 100 K after a short dip into a cryosolution consisting of a glycerol:reservoir solutions mixed at 2:9. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK program packages (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The crystals belonged to space group R3 with unit cell dimensions a D b D 80.4, c D 99.4 Å. The results of data collection and processing are given in Table 1. 2.9. Structure determination and reWnement The structure was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe program (Navaza, 1994) from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994; Dodson et al., 1997). The rotation function was calculated using the coordinates of monomeric isoform of PLA2 from Krait venom (PDB code 1FE5). The Wnal rigid body reWnement gave a correlation coeYcient of 49% and R-factor of 44%. The solution was applied to model coordinates using LSQKAB (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994) and the transformed coordinates were used as starting model for the reWnement using CNS package (Brünger et al., 1998).

The reXections were treated as two data sets, one data set consisting of approximately 5% of reXections (600 reXections), which were randomly selected for the R-free calculations (Brünger, 1992) and the other set consisting of the rest of the data (11 900 reXections). During reWnement, the bond lengths and bond angles were restrained close to the standard values and restraints were also placed on the planarity of groups and non-bonded contacts as deWned by Engh and Huber (1991). Several cycles of reWnement using rigid-body conjugate-gradient minimization, simulated-annealing, and model building with the program `O' (Jones et al., 1991), reduced the Rfactor to 0.294 and the R-free to 0.365 for all the data in the resolution range of 20.0­2.1 Å. The individual isotropic B-factor was reWned which reduced the R-factor to 0.258 and R-free to 0.312. At this stage extra electron density was observed at the center of the interface of two molecules (Fig. 3). The observed density was in two blocks indicating the presence of two independent molecules. The shape of the density did not match with any component of the crystallization buVer. It has been well known that the venoms of snakes contained carbohydrates such as mannose and fucose (Devi, 1968). The crystals of the present structure were analyzed using MALDI-TOF which indicated an excess molecular weight of 363 Da. Based on the results of DNS test, accurate molecular weight determination by MALDI-TOF and characteristic electron density, two mannoses were assumed and modeled into the electron density. The two independent units of mannose Wtted very well into the |Fo ¡ Fc| electron density map (Fig. 3). These were included in the subsequent cycles of reWnement. Further manual model building using |2Fo ¡ Fc| and |Fo ¡ Fc| electron density maps and further reWnement by simulated-annealing with molecular dynamics using a slowcooling protocol from 3000 to 300 K (Brünger et al., 1990), reduced the R-factor to 0.228 and R-free to 0.286 for all reXections in the resolution range 20.0­2.1 Å. The positions of 197 water molecules were determined from

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Sequence of PLA2 As seen from Fig. 2, there are 411 bp that correspond to 137 amino acids. The Wrst 19 amino acids belong to a signal peptide. The mature protein has 118 amino acid residues. So far, the sequences of only four isoforms of Krait PLA2 have been determined (Fig. 4). These contain two monomers (GenBank Accession Nos.: AF297663 and AY455754), homotrimer (GenBank Accession No. AY455756), and the present homodimer (GenBank Accession No. AY455755). The active site residues and the location of cysteine residues are identical in these isoforms. Critical diVerences occur with Lys 3, Tyr 31, Lys 74, Ser 83, and Ser 85 being diVerent in the present PLA2 when compared with the other isoforms (Fig. 4). These sequence diVerences may particularly be important in the formation of the present homodimer that has a higher pI value as compared to the monomer from the same species. Other striking sequence variations have been observed in the regions of -wing (Thr 73-Cys 91) and C-terminus (Ile 113-Gln 120). The sequences of calcium binding loops (Tyr 25-Ser 34) are conserved with four Gly and two Cys residues in Krait venom PLA2s. It is noteworthy that there are three Ser residues among the last seven residues at the C-terminus. These observed variations in the sequences of various isoforms of PLA2 in the B. caeruleus may be responsible for the diVerences in their pharmacological properties and may be speciWc to diVerent oligomeric forms. 3.2. PLA2 dimer The results from the DLS measurements indicated a mean hydrodynamic radius (RH) of 2.55 § 0.08 nm which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 26 kDa (Turner, 1991­1995). Similarly, the sedimentation velocity experiments gave s20, w D 2.81 § 0.04 S which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 29 kDa. These results show that PLA2 occurs as a dimer in solution as well. 3.3. Presence of mannose in the crystals The molecular mass of the crystals as determined by MALDI-TOF was found to be 26 284 Da for the dimer. The molecular mass of the dimer as estimated from the

G. Singh et al. / Journal of Structural Biology 149 (2005) 264­272

269

amino acid sequence was 25 921 Da. The excess mass was found to be of the order of 363 Da. The DNS test has clearly indicated the presence of monosaccharides in the crystal samples. The molecular mass of 363 Da corresponds to the mass of two mannoses, thus it was inferred that the crystals contained two PLA2 molecules and two mannoses. 3.4. Quality of the model The Wnal model consists of two molecules of PLA2, two molecules of mannose, two sodium ions, two chlo-

ride ions, and 197 water molecules. The Wnal electron density map |2Fo ¡ Fc| represents a continuous and welldeWned density (Fig. 5) for backbone as well as for side chain atoms. The Wnal R and R-free factors in the resolution range 20.0­2.1 Å were 19.4 and 22.0%, respectively. The overall B factor for the protein atoms was 23.9 Å2. The Wnal model of PLA2 is of good stereochemical quality with r.m.s. deviations from ideal values being 0.009 Å and 1.6° for bond lengths and angles, respectively. A Ramachandran plot of the main-chain torsion angles ( , ) (Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968) calculated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed that 89.8% of the residues were found in the most allowed regions, while the remaining 10.2% were in the additionally allowed regions. 3.5. Molecular association The structure contains two crystallographically independent molecules A and B (Fig. 6). The DLS studies had indicated that the two molecules were also found associated in solution as well. The overall structures of the two molecules were identical with superimposition of C coordinates showing an r.m.s. shift of 0.6 Å only. The molecules are related by an approximate local dyad axis in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the paper. The most important intermolecular interaction at the interface of the dimer seems to be generated by Asp 49 and Tyr 31 in a symmetrical fashion (Asp 49 O 1 , Tyr 31 OH D 3.06 Å) (Table 3). It was indeed a striking observation that out of four isoforms of Krait PLA2 studied so far, Tyr is found at position 31 only in the present PLA2 (Fig. 4). On further comparison with representative sequences of group I PLA2s from other sources, position 31 is among the least conserved sites but no other PLA2 contained tyrosine residue at position 31 (Fig. 7). Another unique mutation observed in the present structure is Ala 56, which forms two hydrogen

bonds through its backbone oxygen atom with Ser 114 O and Ala 115 N. Other participating residues in the formation of hydrogen bonds at the interface of the dimer (Table 3) are not generally conserved residues among the group I PLA2s (Figs. 4 and 7). The present structure clearly shows that the formation of a dimer might be due to the presence of speciWc residues in the current PLA2. The dimer is formed with an extensive interface. The overall buried area at the interface is approximately 971 Å2. Each monomer has t6580 Å2 of solvent accessible area. 14.7% (971 Å2) of this area is found to be buried in the interface of the dimer. For two mannose molecules around 80.8% of the total solvent accessible surface area is buried upon complex formaTable 3 Intermolecular interactions in the dimer Monomer A Ile 23 O/Asn 62 N 2 Tyr 31 OH/Asp 49 O Ala 56 O/Ser 114 O Ala 56 O/Ala 115 N Tyr 31 N OW 131 OW 131 Asn 62 N 2 Asn 62 O OW 98 Gly 60 N OW 47 OW 186 Ile113 N OW 170 OW 135

tion. The total buried area for both mannose moieties is 455 Å2. Man 1 has a large buried area of 246 Å2 whereas the Man 2 has a buried area 207 Å2. All area calculations were done using areaimol (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). 3.6. Mannose binding Two independent units of mannose were observed at the interface of molecules A and B in the structure. The two mannose molecules poorly interact with each other through a single hydrogen bond involving OH6 of Man 1 and Man 2. Although both mannose units are located at the center of the interface (Figs. 6 and 8) Man 1 is extensively in contact with PLA2 A than B (Fig. 9). Man 2 is predominately interacting with PLA2 B (Table 4, Fig. 8). The presence of so many interactions between mannose and PLA2 molecules in the snake venoms (Table 4, Fig. 8) suggest that sugar molecules seem to play an important role in venoms (Devi, 1968). 3.7. EVect of mannose on catalytic action It had been reported that sugar was present in the venoms of snakes which includes both mannose and fucose (Devi, 1968). Although the content of sugars is small but it seems to be important for preserving the PLA2 enzymes for a long period. The presence of two mannose molecules indicate that they have a stabilizing eVect on the structure of the dimer. As a result of dimerization and also due to extensive interactions of mannose molecules with various residues of PLA2 molecule including those

the PLA2 molecule possesses a signiWcant aYnity for sugars. The mannoses are involved in the interactions that have also been observed in the complexes of PLA2 with its inhibitors (Chandra et al., 2002a,b,c,d; Singh et al., 2003). One of the most unique features of the current PLA2 is the presence of Tyr residue at position 31. The interactions of Tyr 31 with Asp 49 of the second molecule of the dimer as well as with Man 1, are of signiWcance in the binding of mannoses and dimerization of PLA2.

with catalytically important Asp 49, the PLA2 becomes inactive. The inactivity of the enzyme and presence of a large number of interactions at the interface, contribute to the long term stability of this isoform of PLA2. These results are indicative of the signiWcance of sugar molecules with respect to PLA2 structure and function.

4. Conclusions The observation of two mannoses at the interface of a PLA2 dimer has important implications. It reveals that
