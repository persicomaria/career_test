Abstract Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) catalyzes the reduction of 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to proline with concomitant oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+. The enzymatic cycle between P5C and proline is very important in many physiological and pathological processes. Human P5CR was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and puriWed to homogeneity by chromatography. Enzymatic assays of the wild-type protein were carried out using 3,4-dehydro-L-proline as substrate and NAD+ as cofactor. The homopolymer was characterized by cross-linking and size exclusion gel Wltration chromatography. Human P5CR was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor-diVusion method at 37 °C. DiVraction data were obtained to a resolution of 2.8 Å and were suitable for high resolution X-ray structure determination. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The interconversion of 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C)1 and proline initiates a chain of cellular biochemical, energetic, and physiological processes through the transfer of oxidizing and reducing potential [1]. P5C, a physiological intermediate in the interconversions of proline, ornithine, glutamate, and arginine, can be transported into the cytosol as a source of oxidizing potential where its reduction by 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR, EC 1.5.1.2) to proline generates NAD(P)+[2]. Proline can then be transported into mitochondria where its oxidation by proline dehydrogenase (POX, EC 1.5.99.8) to P5C transfers electrons into the mitochondrial electron transport with an intervening Xavoprotein, thereby completing a P5C/proline redox cycle [2]. In addition to its well-established role as an osmoprotectant capable of withstanding stressful environ*

ments such as drought, excessive salinity, and low or high temperature in plants [3], proline can function as a nonenzymatic antioxidant required by microorganisms, animals, and plants to minimize damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4]. Meanwhile, the conversion of proline to P5C by p53-induced POX can enhance generation of proline-dependent ROS [5], and leads to the p53-dependent initiation of apoptosis through a calcineurin-dependent pathway [6]. P5C could inhibit the proliferation and survival of ECV-304 and DECV cells, and induced apoptosis in both cell lines [7]. Abnormalities in the proline/ P5C redox cycle have been associated with a number of mammalian diseases. For example, POX mutations were associated with hyperprolinemia in the schizophrenic patients [8]. The decreased P5C reductase activity may be implicated in retinal degeneration in mice [9]. Although several human P5CR isoforms have been deposited in GenBank and the existence of P5CR isoenzymes has recently been demonstrated in soybean and spinach leaves [10,11], only a single copy gene located to human chromosome band 17q25.3 has been identiWed to encode

P5CR [12]. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of P5CR shows 26­42% identity with each other and a conserved GXGXXA/G sequence motif is present in the P5CR protein family [13]. Human P5CR extends by nearly 40 amino acids at the carboxyl terminal beyond other reductase sequences. Previous puriWcation of P5CRs has revealed that the native enzyme is a polymer from diVerent organisms [13­16]. P5CR from Escherichia coli is also involved in metabolism of some proline analogs [17]. The recent reports of the crystal structures of Neisseria meningitides MC58 and Streptococcus pyogenes have allowed a better understanding of the functional diVerences in this protein family on their structure determinants [18]. There is presently no known three-dimensional structure of human P5CR. In this study, we report the puriWcation, characterization, and crystallization of human P5CR. Materials and methods Protein expression and puriWcation The full-length sequence (NCBI Accession No.: NM006907) for human P5CR (33 kDa) was ampliWed from a human hepatoma cell line cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with primers: PYCR1-F: 5 -GAAAGAATTCATGAGCGTGGGCT TCATCGGCGC-3 . PYCR1-R: 5 -GAAACTCGAGTCAATCCTTGCCCG CTGG-3 . The PCR products were restricted with EcoRI and XhoI, and ligated into EcoRI and XhoI restricted sites of the pET28a(+) vector (Novagen Inc.) with a 6£ His tag at the N-terminus. A further transformation into E. coli DH5 competent cells was performed and positive clones with an insert of the right size were conWrmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and the transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing 50 g/ml kanamycin. The cells were then cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 g/ ml kanamycin. When the culture density reached A600 D 0.5, the culture was induced with 0.25 mM IPTG or without IPTG and was grown for an additional 3 h before the cells were harvested. Cell lysis and ammonium sulfate precipitation The bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buVer (20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.4, 500 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and homogenized by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min to remove the cell debris. Next, ammonium sulfate (AS) was added with stirring to the solution at 4 °C. The precipitate formed between 0 and 20% AS was collected. The protein was suspended in storage buVer (20 mM Caps, pH 9.4, 0.5 M NaCl), and incubated

with 1 mg/ml RNaseA (Sigma) and 15 U/ml DNaseI (Takara) at room temperature overnight. Chromatographic puriWcation The supernatant was applied to an Ni2+-chelating column (2 ml Ni­NTA agarose) and the contaminant protein was washed oV with lysis buVer containing 5 mM imidazole. The target protein was eluted with lysis buVer containing 300 mM imidazole. The sample was concentrated with an Ultrafree 10,000 NMWL Wlter unit (Millipore) to less than 1 ml and injected into a Superdex-200 10/300 column (Pharmacia) in running buVer (storage buVer). The sample eluted isocratically at 10­13 ml of running buVer volume was diluted to 100 mM NaCl in 20 mM Caps, pH 9.4, and applied through a 10 ml superloop (Pharmacia) onto a Resource Q 1 ml column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 20 mM Caps, pH 9.4, before being eluted in a increasing salt gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl in 20 mM Caps, pH 9.4. P5CR activity assays The 3,4-dehydro-L-proline dehydrogenase activity assays of P5CR were performed at room temperature using a sensitive spectrophotometric method [17]. In brief, after the enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was initialized by adding diluted P5CR (1 l, 20 mg/ml) into 200 l reaction buVer containing 300 mM Tris­HCl (pH 9.0, at which P5CR achieved maximized activity), NAD+ (0.4 mM), varied concentrations of 3,4-dehydro-L-proline (0.02­1 mM). Using the mM extinction coeYcient of NAD(P)H (6.22), initial rates of product formation were calculated by increase of absorbance at 340 nm/min from the Wrst 60 s of a 5 min recording period. Reproducibility of all analyses was conWrmed by taking each measurement at least twice with a Xuctuation of less than 8%. A sample with both substrates except P5CR was served as a negative control. Crosslinking with EGS The P5CR protein was diluted to 10 mg/ml in 20 mM Hepes, pH 8.9, 100 mM NaCl. Ethylene glycolbis (EGS) was dissolved in DMSO to 1 mM and then added to 10 l of protein sample with a Wnal concentration ranging from 2 to 400 M. After the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, the reaction was quenched for 5 min by adding 1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5) to a Wnal concentration of 50 mM. After loading the sample containing 2 l SDS load buVer, it was run on an 8% SDS­polyacrylamide gel in SDS electrophoresis buVer. Crystallization and X-ray data collection The puriWed human P5CR was concentrated to 15 mg/ ml in 20 mM Caps, pH 9.4, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT.

The protein concentration was conWrmed spectrophotometrically by the Bradford method. Crystallization was performed by the hanging-drop vapor-diVusion method at 16 and 37 °C. In preliminary assays, the Hampton Research Crystal Screen I and Crystal Screen II reagent kits were used to screen crystallization conditions. One microliter of protein solution was mixed with 1 l reservoir solution containing 0.8­1 M sodium acetate, 30­40 mM imidazole (pH 6.5), 50­60 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), and the mixture was equilibrated against 400 ml reservoir solution at 16 and 37 °C. The best crystals were obtained in a 37 °C incubator by mixing 1 l protein with 1 l reservoir solution and 1 l 100% paraYn oil or 1 l protein with 1 l reservoir solution containing 0.1­0.2% (w/v) agarose. Initial cube-shaped crystals appeared after 1­3 days. Crystals were immersed in cryoprotectant for 1 min, mounted into a nylon cryo loop, and then Xash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to 100 K. The cryoprotectant was prepared by adding 20% glycerol to the mother-liquor reservoir. Preliminary diVraction data sets were collected at room temperature in-house using a Rigaku MM007rotating-anode CuK X-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 20 mA ( D 1.5418 Å) with a RAIXS IV++ image plate detector. The beam was focused using Osmic mirrors. All intensity data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 programs DENZO and SCALEPACK [19]. Results and discussion Human P5CR is expressed as a soluble protein Human P5CR was over-expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with a 6£ His and T7-tag at its N-terminus under T7 promoter with or without IPTG induction. After being induced for 3 h, the expressed P5CR comprised »40% of the total protein and most of the expressed P5CR was soluble. High expression of human P5CR does not aVect the cell growth. Soluble P5CR in the crude lysate was used for further puriWcation, and P5CR was fractionated from the crude lysate by 20% AS precipitation. The P5CR recovered was associated with small amounts of nucleic acid, and could be digested by incubation with RNaseA and DNaseI. Sequential systematic puriWcation of P5CR using chromatographic methods, including aYnity, size exclusion, and anionic exchange, turned out to be eYcient and convenient. The various puriWcation steps are summarized in Table 1.

Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1B). Only the 370 kDa fraction protein was chosen to be further puriWed with anionic exchange. P5CR eluted as a single peak with a high A280/ A260 ratio of 1.8 at about 300 mM salt concentration and its purity was conWrmed by SDS­PAGE (Fig. 1B). The 370 kDa P5CR protein was subsequently used for crystallization and enzyme activity assays. The cross-linking behavior of P5CR further supports the assembly mode of the supercomplex. The homopolymer was also detected in cross-linking experiments (Fig. 2). These results suggest that a decamer may be the essential form existing in solution. Based on this evidence, human P5CR could further aggregate into polydecamers or homopolymers. Human P5CR implicates in dehydrogenation of 3,4-dehydroL-proline

fere with the crystallization of the enzyme, the growth of well-ordered crystals of human P5CR suitable for X-ray diVraction analysis was found to be critically dependent on temperature (Fig. 4). As a rule, we found the bigger the crystal size, the better the quality of diVraction. To avoid autoaggregation, crystallization experiments were started just after the incubation of P5CR and reservoir solution at 37 °C for 20 min. Large crystals were obtained using agarose to slow the growth. After growing at 37 °C for 7 days, the crystals achieved a Wnal size of 550 £ 80 £ 50 M. A set of data were subsequently collected from this crystal, which belonged to space group C2 with

A functional characterization of the enzyme was performed by dehydrogenation of the 3,4-dehydro-L-proline. The stability studies showed that the enzyme still had activity after incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, with irreversible loss of activity at 90 °C for 5 min. Thus, human P5CR was very stable in the Caps buVer, pH 9.4. The enzyme was stabilized for up to 6 months at ¡80 °C in storage buVer. 3,4-Dehydro-L-proline, which has a double bond between C3 and C4 of proline, can be dehydrogenated by human P5CR with apparent Km D 0.141 § 0.012 mM, Kcat D 10 s¡1. The NAD+dependent activity of human P5CR was almost fully inhibited by 0.1 mM proline; interestingly, 1 mM Mg2+stimulated the activity up to 60% (Fig. 3).
