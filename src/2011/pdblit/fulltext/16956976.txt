Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) was recently identified as the first histone demethylase that specifically demethylates monomethylated and dimethylated histone H3 at K4. It is a component of the CoREST and other corepressor complexes and plays an important role in silencing neuronal-specific genes in nonneuronal cells, but the molecular mechanisms of its action remain unclear. The 2.8-Å-resolution crystal structure of the human LSD1 reveals that LSD1 defines a new subfamily of FAD-dependent oxidases. The active center of LSD1 is characterized by a remarkable 1,245-Å3 substrate-binding cavity with a highly negative electrostatic potential. Although the protein core of LSD1 resembles other flavoenzymes, its enzymatic activity and functions require two additional structural modules: an N-terminal SWIRM domain important for protein stability and a large insertion in the catalytic domain indispensable both for the demethylase activity and the interaction with CoREST. These results provide a framework for further probing the catalytic mechanism and the functional roles of LSD1.

closely resembles those of flavin-dependent oxidases (22) and contains a marked large catalytic cavity with a highly negative electrostatic potential. We further demonstrate that a large insertion in the catalytic domain is indispensable both for the demethylase activity of LSD1 and the interaction between LSD1 and CoREST. Results

istone proteins are subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, and it is these histone modifications that function as the molecular switches that alter the state of compaction of chromatin to allow gene activation or repression (1­3). Some histone modifications (e.g., acetylation and phosphorylation) are highly dynamic, whereas others (e.g., methylation) have been regarded as ``permanent'' chromatin marks. However, the discoveries of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and jumonji domain C (JmjC) domain-containing histone demethylase 1 (JHDM1) have changed this picture (4, 5). Shi and colleagues demonstrated that LSD1 is a histone lysine demethylase that specifically demethylates monomethylated and dimethylated histone H3 at K4 (4). More recently, we and others have shown that many JmjC domaincontaining proteins are capable of demethylating dimethylated and trimethylated histone proteins (4­10). These findings suggest that histone methylation is a reversible modification and can be regulated under similar enzymatic control as other histone modifications (11­13). LSD1 is a component of a number of transcriptional corepressor complexes, such as CoREST, CtBP, and HDAC complexes, and plays an important role in silencing neuronal-specific genes in nonneuronal cells (14­19). The C-terminal two-thirds of LSD1 contains an amine oxidase-like (AOL) domain, which shares extensive sequence homology to FAD-dependent oxidases (Fig. 1 A and C) (20­22). In addition, LSD1 also contains an N-terminal SWIRM domain (Fig. 1 A), which has been recently identified as a conserved motif often found in chromatin remodeling and modifying complexes with unknown function (23). Recent studies suggest that the specificity and activity of LSD1 can be modulated by its interacting factors (4, 24­26). However, the molecular mechanism by which this regulation is achieved remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of LSD1 at 2.8-Å resolution (Fig. 1). The x-ray analysis reveals that the overall structure of LSD1

LSD1 with an N-terminal deletion, LSD1 N (residues 172­833) (Fig. 1 A), was prepared by overexpression and purification from Escherichia coli. LSD1 N was chosen for structural study because the N-terminal region of LSD1 was confirmed to be dispensable for LSD1 activity and is an unstructured region (27). For simplicity, we hereafter use LSD1 to represent LSD1 N unless stated otherwise. The purified LSD1 was crystallized in space group P6122, and the structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. The crystallographic refinement resulted in a model with Rwork and Rfree values of 23.0% and 28.3%, respectively (Table 1, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The structure of LSD1 contains three domains. Two of them, the SWIRM (residues 172­270) and AOL (residues 271­417 and 523­833) domains, pack together through extensive interactions resulting in a globular structure (Fig. 1 A and B). The SWIRM domain consists mostly of -helices and is a newly identified structural module often found in chromatin-associated proteins (Fig. 1 B and C) (28­30). The AOL domain folds into a compact structure that exhibits a topology found in several flavindependent oxidases (Fig. 1B) (22, 31). The AOL domain contains a large insertion (residues 418­522) that forms an additional domain and adopts a tower-like structure (Tower domain) protruding away from the AOL domain by 75 Å (Fig. 1 B and C). The Tower consists of a pair of long helices that adopts a typical antiparallel coiled-coil conformation (Fig. 1C).
The SWIRM Domain. The SWIRM domain of LSD1 reveals a six-helical bundle architecture characterized by a long helix, SW 4, in the center surrounded by five other helices (Fig. 2A). One unique feature of the LSD1 SWIRM domain is an additional two-stranded -sheet formed between the SW 4­SW 5 loop and the C terminus of the SWIRM domain (Figs. 1C and 2 A). This short -sheet helps anchor the interactions between the SWIRM and AOL domains by forcing the SW 6­SW 2 loop to protrude out into a hydrophobic

pocket formed by helices F 1, F 2, F 3, and F 8 of the AOL domain (Fig. 2B). The LSD1 SWIRM domain is structurally most similar to those of the chromatin-remodeling proteins Swi3 and ADA2 (Fig. 2 C and D). The three SWIRM domains have very similar hydrophobic core packings. The differences among the three structures are primarily confined to SW 1 and SW 2, which are not conserved and are positioned further away from the hydrophobic core (Fig. 2 C and D).
The SWIRM­AOL Domain Interaction. The SWIRM domain packs

closely against the AOL domain and is located far away from both the FAD-binding site and the catalytic center of LSD1 (Fig. 1B). A three-amino-acid motif (F264G265I266) between SW 6 and SW 2

anchors the binding through extensive interactions with the AOL domain, involving both hydrophobic contacts and hydrogenbonding interactions (Fig. 2B). The side chains of F264 and I266 and the main chain C atom of G265 stack against a hydrophobic pocket from the AOL domain. These hydrophobic contacts are buttressed by extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions between the backbone of this tri-residue motif and the side chains of R295 and Q348. The SWIRM­AOL packing buries a total surface area of 1,115 Å2, and the residues that form the interface are highly conserved across species (Fig. 1C). Based on these observations, we conclude that the prearrangement of the SWIRM and AOL domains is important for LSD1 protein functions. Although the SWIRM domain can be expressed as a separate protein with native

conformation (28), efforts to prepare the AOL and Tower domains of LSD1 yielded insoluble protein (data not shown), suggesting that it requires an interface with the SWIRM domain for stability.
The AOL Domain. The AOL domain of LSD1 folds into two well defined subdomains, an FAD-binding subdomain and a substratebinding subdomain, with their sequences intermingled together (Figs. 1C and 3A). The FAD-binding subdomain has three fragments (residues 271­356, 559­657, and 770­833) and adopts a mixed ­ structure (Fig. 3A). As is evident from the high degree of sequence conservation, the binding mode and the conformation of the FAD in the LSD1 structure closely resemble those observed in the enzymes sharing the dinucleotide-binding fold (Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site) (22, 32­34). The substrate-binding subdomain comprises three fragments (residues 357­417, 523­558, and 658­769) and is characterized by a six-stranded mixed -sheet flanked by six -helices (Fig. 3A). The two subdomains create a big cavity that defines the enzyme activity center at their interface (Fig. 3 A and C). The AOL domain of LSD1 is most similar to the structure of maize polyamine oxidase (PAO). The two structures can be superimposed with a 2.9-Å rmsd in the positions of 419 of 462 C atoms (Figs. 1C and 3B). Although the similarity is evident in the FAD-binding subdomain, the structure of LSD1 substrate-binding subdomain differs from that of PAO in several aspects. First, LSD1 comprises a long insertion between S 2 and S 3 compared with PAO (Fig. 3B). Second, LSD1 contains a large catalytic cavity between the FAD- and substrate-binding subdomains with a volume of 1,245 Å3 (Figs. 3C and 4A). In contrast, the catalytic center of PAO is located in a narrow U-shaped tunnel with a significantly smaller volume (716 Å3) (32, 35). The difference in the shape of the substrate-binding site reflects the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes; the substrates of LSD1 are methylated histone peptides, which are bulkier than the linear-shaped substrates of PAO, like spermidine (35). Taken together, these data reinforce the conclusion that, although PAO and the AOL domain of LSD1 share

The positional change of three -helices (S 1, S 2, and S 4) of PAO relative to those of LSD1 significantly reduces the volume of the catalytic cavity.

a similar overall folding topology, LSD1 defines a new subfamily of FAD-dependent oxidases with unique substrate specificity (4).
The Catalytic Center. The catalytic center of LSD1 consists of a remarkable large cavity that occupies the center of the AOL domain at the interface between the substrate- and FAD-binding subdomains (Fig. 4A). The cavity is framed by many structural elements that surround the catalytic center; a six-stranded -sheet (S 1 and S 6­S 9) and a long helix (S 3) form the left side and the bottom surfaces, respectively, whereas a short one-turn helix (S 4), a two-stranded -sheet (F 5­F 7), and several loops with variable lengths cover the rest of the cavity (Fig. 4A). There is a marked contrast in the chemical nature of different areas on the inner surface of the catalytic cavity. The left side is a flat surface

The Tower Domain Contains an Antiparallel Coiled Coil and Is Indispensable for the Demethylase Activity of LSD1. The overall structure

of the LSD1 Tower domain is a typical antiparallel coiled coil, with two extended -helices (T 1 and T 2) that pack together in a left-handed superhelix (Figs. 1B and 5A). T 1 is the extension of helix S 2 of the AOL domain (Figs. 1B and 3A). The sequence of the Tower domain reveals a repeating pattern of seven residues, (abcdefg)n, the characteristic of coiled-coil proteins, with hydrophobic amino acids predominating at positions a and d of the heptad repeat (Fig. 5A) (37). The Tower protrudes from the catalytic center of LSD1 and makes no obvious contact with the rest of the protein (Fig. 1B). This arrangement raises the question of whether the Tower domain plays a role in the histone demethylase activity. To address this issue, a deletion mutant of LSD1 (LSD1 Tower), in which the Tower domain was deleted and replaced by a pentaglycine loop, was expressed and purified from E. coli (Fig. 5B). LSD1 was able to reduce the methylation level at K4, whereas LSD1 Tower failed to do so even at a much higher protein concentration (Fig. 5C and data not shown). An effect of this deletion mutation on the structural stability was ruled out, owing to the fact that its biophysical and structural properties are similar to those of the wild-type LSD1 protein as assessed by gel-filtration chromatography analysis (data not shown). These results support the notion that the Tower domain is indispensable for the histone demethylase activity of LSD1.

The modeled C atom (green sphere) is located 3.6 Å from the N5 atom of the FAD. The side chain of the catalytically important K661 is shown in ball-and-stick representation. The conserved water molecule, which makes hydrogen-bonding interactions with both K661 and FAD, is shown as a red sphere. The hydrogenbonding interactions are represented by dotted purple lines.

The 3D coordination system denotes the orientation relative to that in B. (D) Histone demethylase activity assay of LSD1 and its mutants. Approximately equal amounts (2 g) of wild-type and mutant recombinant LSD1 were incubated with equal amounts of 3H-labeled H3K4 methylated substrates. Released 3H-formaldehyde from each reaction was quantified by scintillation counting (cpm).

The Tower Domain Mediates the Interaction Between LSD1 and CoREST. Besides being important for the LSD1 demethylase

and is lined mainly by hydrophobic residues (Fig. 4 A and B). In contrast, the right side of the cavity presents mostly the acidic side chains and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms on the concaveshaped surface (Fig. 4 A and B). Notably, point mutations of the residues on both sides of the cavity abolished the LSD1 demethylase activity (Fig. 4D). The cavity goes deep into the protein, extending for a length of 23 Å from its entrance to the core of the catalytic site where the flavin ring is located. K661 is a crucial element characterizing the innermost section of the catalytic center (Fig. 4A). It is hydrogen-bonded to the N5 atom of the FAD via a conserved water molecule (Fig. 4A). The fact that a point mutation, K661A, completely abolished the demethylation activity of LSD1 suggests that K661 plays an essential role in flavin reduction as its counterpart, K300, in the case of PAO (25, 36). Compared with other flavin-dependent oxidases, LSD1 has another unique structural feature: the two diagonally interacting helices, S 1 and S 3, form a highly acidic flat surface at the entrance of the catalytic cavity, serving as an additional binding site for the basic histone H3 tail (Fig. 4 A and C). Most of the residues forming this surface and the catalytic cavity are highly conserved not only among LSD1 orthologs in different species but also in LSD2, a close homolog of LSD1 (Fig. 1C) (4). Thus, it is likely that LSD2 also contains a similar catalytic center with a large cavity. This finding is consistent with the observation that the two proteins share the same substrate specificity (unpublished data).

activity, the Tower domain of LSD1 may also act as an adaptor to recruit other proteins. LSD1 was identified as a component of the putative LSD1 complex containing HDAC1 2, CtBP1, CoREST, HBC80, and BRAF35, among others (17, 25). Growing evidence showed that LSD1-interacting proteins regulate its activity and substrate specificity (24­26). One of these proteins, CoREST, endows LSD1 with the ability to demethylate nucleosomal substrates and protects LSD1 from proteasomal degradation (24, 25). We investigated the interaction of a His-tagged C-terminal fragment of CoREST (residues 293­482) with two complementary deletion mutants of LSD1, LSD1 Tower, and LSD1-Tower (amino acids 420­520) employing a pull-down assay (Fig. 5 B and D). We were surprised to find that the Tower domain of LSD1 is, by itself, sufficient for a stable interaction with CoREST-C, forming complexes that can survive extensive washing (Fig. 5D). The fact that LSD1 Tower does not interact with CoREST indicates that the SWIRM and AOL domains of LSD1 do not significantly contribute to the interaction with CoREST (Fig. 5D). Based on these results, we conclude that the Tower domain of LSD1 contains the binding site for CoREST. Discussion
The Functions of the SWIRM Domain. Although both structure and biochemical data presented here indicate that the SWIRM domain is important for the stability of LSD1, the function of the SWIRM domain in LSD1 has not been established yet. Both the Swi3 and Ada2 SWIRM domains are able to interact with double-stranded DNAs nonspecifically, and these interactions are important for the in vivo functions of Swi3 and Ada2 (29, 30). These findings led us to hypothesize that the LSD1 SWIRM domain might also be capable of binding nucleic acids. However, the gel-mobility shift assay clearly demonstrated that the SWIRM domain of LSD1 did not shift DNA even at a very high protein concentration, indicating that the LSD1 SWIRM domain is not a DNA-binding motif (data not shown). A recent study showed that the SWIRM domain of LSD1 may interact with the N-terminal tail of histone H3 (28­30). Particularly, an H3 peptide bearing two point mutations (R8E T11K) weakened the interaction between the SWIRM domain and the peptide (30). However, close examination of our crystal structure of LSD1 revealed that the SWIRM domain is too far away from

the catalytic center of LSD1 ( 24 Å). Without large conformational change in LSD1, it is unlikely that a histone H3 tail binds to LSD1 with its K4 located at the catalytic center and R8 T11 interacting with the SWIRM domain simultaneously. More biochemical and structural studies are needed to resolve this discrepancy and to better understand the functions of the SWIRM domain in LSD1.
The Functions of the Tower Domain. The Tower domain directly

interacts with one of the LSD1-interacting proteins, CoREST (Fig. 5D). The two SANT domains of CoREST have been proposed to be a histone-tail-presenting module (38). Consistent with this model, the SANT2 domain of CoREST was shown to play a key role in endowing LSD1 with the ability to demethylate nucleosomal substrates (24). Thus, the Tower domain of LSD1, together with the CoREST SANT2 domain, functions as a molecular bridge that connects LSD1 to its nucleosomal substrates. In addition to mediating the interaction with CoREST, we also found that the Tower domain is indispensable for the histone demethylase activity of LSD1 (Fig. 5C). But how does the Tower domain affect the activity of LSD1 without direct interactions with the catalytic center? One possible mechanism is that the Tower may play a role in substrate binding. Alternatively, the involvement of the Tower domain on the LSD1 enzymatic activity could be due to an allosteric effect. That is, in the presence of the methylated histone substrate, the Tower domain induces some conformational changes in LSD1 that transform the catalytic center into an active conformation.
Implications for the Substrate Binding Mechanism. So far, the precise

mechanism by which LSD1 recognizes the histone peptide substrates and catalyzes histone demethylation remains unknown. In this respect, the crystal structure of LSD1 reported here reveals several unique features of LSD1. First, structural comparison of flavoproteins that carry out dehydrogenation reactions has revealed that the substrate carbon atom that undergoes flavin-dependent oxidation binds in a highly conserved position in front of the flavin N5-C4a locus, indicating that the substrate carbon atom of a
13960 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0606381103

flavoenzyme could be accurately located in its structure (22). On this basis, the C atom of a methylated lysine was modeled in the catalytic site of LSD1 (Fig. 4A). The distance between the C atom and the protein surface is 21 Å. It is unlikely that a histone peptide adopting an extended conformation would bind to LSD1 with its methylated lysine residue positioned in the catalytic center. Thus, we conclude that the histone peptide must enter the catalytic cavity and fold into certain unique conformation to position the methylated lysine residue in the correct location for catalysis. Second, the opening of the catalytic cavity is characterized by several highly conserved solvent-accessible glutamate and aspartate residues (Fig. 4 A and D), which seem to be suited to fulfilling the role of interacting with the basic residues of the histone peptide. Third, the catalytic cavity of LSD1 can accommodate at most a 10-residue polypeptide, which is shorter than the minimum length ( 16 and 21) of the histone H3 peptide required for the substrate recognition by LSD1 (27). These structural features lead us to suggest that the acidic surface formed by helices S 1 and S 3 (Fig. 4C) at the entrance of the catalytic center makes additional sequencespecific interactions with the H3 peptide. Based on these observations, we propose a model of substrate binding by LSD1 in which the methylated histone H3 tail adopts a loop-like structure so that the methylated K4 is positioned at the catalytic center and the negative charged residues (for instance, R8 and K9) of the H3 peptide make sequence-specific contacts with the acidic residues of LSD1 both inside and outside of the catalytic cavity (Fig. 4). Although our proposed substrate-binding mechanism is plausible based on the LSD1 crystal structure and current biochemical data, additional structural studies of LSD1 complexed with peptide substrates and other interacting proteins are essential to verify this model and to clarify the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of histone demethylation by LSD1.

helped the expressed fusion proteins in a soluble native form. The His-SUMO-LSD1 protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity column following standard procedures. Then the ULP1 protease was added to remove the His-SUMO tag. The LSD1 protein was further purified by gel-filtration chromatography. The LSD1 mutants and the C-terminal fragment of CoREST (CoREST-C) were cloned, expressed, and purified following the same procedures as described above.
Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystals were grown by hangingdrop vapor diffusion against 5% PEG 8000, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Na2HPO4 KH2PO4 (pH 6.33). They are in space group P6122 (a b 187.11 Å; c 106.58 Å) with one LSD1 molecule per asymmetric unit. For preparation of a mercury derivative, crystals were transferred gradually into 25% PEG 8000, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Mes (pH 6.3), and 0.5 mM FAD and soaked in this buffer with 0.1 mM added HgAc2. Both native and derivative crystals were transferred stepwise into a stabilizing solution containing 30% PEG 8000, 25% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Na2HPO4 KH2PO4 (pH 6.33), and 0.5 mM FAD. The crystals were flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon Source beamline 23-ID. Data were integrated and scaled by using the program HKL2000 (Table 1) (39). Structure Determination and Refinement. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data from the mercury derivative were used to obtain initial phases. Three mercury atoms were located and refined, and the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phases were calculated by using SHARP (40); the initial multiwavelength anomalous dispersion map was significantly improved by solvent flattening, which allowed us to fit a model of the maize PAO structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1B37) as a rigid body. From this initial model, another round of density modification led to a clear and completely interpretable map. A model of the relevant residues of human LSD1 was built into the density by using the program O (41); the model was then transferred into the native unit cell by rigid-body refinement and further refined by using simulated

annealing and positional refinement in CNS (42) with manual rebuilding using O.
Histone Demethylase Assay. The histone demethylase assay was

performed essentially as previously described (5). Briefly, core histone substrates methylated by GST-SET7 in the presence of 3H-SAM were incubated with wild-type or mutant recombinant LSD1 in histone demethylation buffer (100 mM glycine, pH 9 1 mM PMSF 1 mM DTT 50 mM KCl) at 37°C for 1 h. For detection of the released 3H-formaldehyde, a modified NASH method (43) was used. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, an equal volume of NASH reagent (3.89 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M acetic acid, and 0.2% 2,4-pentanedione) was added into the supernatant, and the mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 50 min before extraction with equal volume of 1-pentanol. The extracted radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. g of purified His-SUMOCoREST-C (residues 293­482) protein was incubated with 20 g of LSD1, 18 g of LSD1 Tower, or 4 g of LSD1-Tower, respectively, at 4°C for 16 h in 40 l of binding buffer (25 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0 300 mM NaCl 3 mM imidazole) containing 5 l of Ni2 -NTA beads. The beads were then washed three times by 100 l of binding buffer and finally resuspended in 20 l of 2 SDS protein sample buffer. The samples of the input, beads, and flow-through were analyzed by SDS PAGE. The HisSUMO tag itself did not interact with LSD1.
