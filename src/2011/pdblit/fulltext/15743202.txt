A series of derivatives of 2-anilino-5-phenyloxazole (5) has been identified as inhibitors of VEGFR2 kinase. Herein we describe the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this novel template. Optimization of both aryl rings led to very potent inhibitors at both the enzymatic and cellular levels. Oxazole 39 had excellent solubility and good oral PK when dosed as the bis-mesylate salt and demonstrated moderate in vivo efficacy against HT29 human colon tumor xenografts. X-ray crystallography confirmed the proposed binding mode, and comparison of oxazoles 39 and 46 revealed interesting differences in orientation of 2-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl rings, respectively, attached at the meta position of the 5-phenyl ring.
Introduction The growth of solid tumors is dependent on the formation of new capillaries from existing blood vessels.1 This process, known as angiogenesis, is facilitated by a number of mitogenic endogenous proteins, of which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is thought to be key. VEGF is upregulated by tumors and induces a mitogenic response on binding to the tyrosine kinase receptor VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk-1) on nearby endothelial cells.2 Inhibition of angiogenesis via blocking of this pathway has attracted widespread interest as an approach to anticancer therapy.3 The first successful clinical validation to this approach came recently from phase III trials of bevacizumab (Avastin), a monoclonal antibody to VEGF, which when combined with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer met its primary endpoint of improving survivial.4 Other large-molecule therapeutic approaches currently in clinical development include neutralizing antibodies to VEGFR25 and a soluble VEGF decoy-receptor.6 A number of orally active small-molecule inhibitors of VEGFR2 are currently undergoing clinical evaluation, including the anilinophthalazine (1) (PTK787/Vatalanib, Schering/ Novartis, phase III),7 the anilinoquinazoline (2) (ZD6474, AstraZeneca, phase II),8 the indolinone (3) (SU11248/ Sutent, Pfizer, phase III),9 and the isothiazole (4) (CP547,632, Pfizer, phase I/II).10 As part of our efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR2 kinase domain, screening of our sample collection identified 2-anilino-5-phenyloxazole (5) as an initial hit.11 This oxazole was an attractive starting point, exhibiting moderate VEGFR2 enzyme potency (IC50 ) 1.2 µM) and inhibiting VEGF* Corresponding author.

induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with an IC50 of 3 µM. As a measure of selectivity, 5 was found to only weakly

inhibit the basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) induced proliferation of HUVEC cells (IC50 ) 24 µM). Herein, we report on the SAR of this series, the enzyme binding mode as evidenced by X-ray structures and initial in vivo efficacy. Results and Discussion Initially we focused our investigation on the 2-anilino portion of the template, since such substitutions were easily accessible from known 2-chloro-5-phenyloxazole (7) via condensation with commercial anilines. As shown in Scheme 1, 2-aminoacetophenone was initially converted to 2-mercapto-5-phenyloxazole (6) by reaction

with carbon disulfide under basic conditions,12 and subsequent treatment with phosphorus oxychloride led to 2-chloro-5-phenyloxazole (7).13 The SAR at both enzyme and cellular levels substituting off the aniline ring is exemplified in Table 1. Monosubstitutions led only to marginal changes in enzyme and cell potencies (oxazoles 8-16). Enhancements in enzymatic activity were observed by addition of methoxy groups, most prominently 3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino-5-phenyloxazole (19). However, significant improvements in enzyme potency were only observed from anilines combining a 2-methoxy group with either a 5-diethylsulfonamide (oxazole 20) or 5-ethyl sulfone (oxazole 21). Compared with the parent oxazole 5, 2-(5ethylsulfonyl-2-methoxyanilino)-5-phenyloxazole (21) yielded 25- and 10-fold enhancements in enzyme and cell potencies, respectively, and 5-ethylsulfonyl-2-methoxyaniline became the preferred aniline for SAR exploration of the 5-phenyl position. Oxazoles 9 and 13, derived from o-methoxy and m-ethyl sulfone aniline, respectively, were only slight improvements over the parent and do not predict the efficacy of oxazole 21. Our homology model, later supported by crystallographic data, proposed that the methoxy group sits in a lipophilic pocket and acts to orientate the sulfone group to bind to Asn 923. To examine the SAR around the 5-phenyl ring, we employed a synthetic route previously described by Froeyen14 whereby a variety of 2-azido-acetophenones 22 (readily available from the corresponding bromide) were converted in situ to their iminophosphoranes and condensed with 2-methoxy-5-ethyl sulfone phenylisothiocyanate (23) to the corresponding -keto carbodiimides,

which readily cyclize to the oxazoles 24-33 (Scheme 2). In general, ortho-substitution of the 5-phenyl ring was not favorable, whereas meta- and para-substitutions of the phenyl ring did not improve the inhibition profile compared to unsubstituted oxazole 21, as shown in Table 2. A homology model of the VEGFR2 enzyme, based on FGFR crystal structures, was used to predict the binding mode of the oxazole at the ATP binding site.15,16 The Cys919 of the peptide backbone was thought to bind to the inhibitor via hydrogen donor and acceptor bonds with the anilino and oxazole nitrogens, respectively (Figure 1). As predicted from the binding mode, introduction of a methyl group at either the aniline nitrogen or the 4 position on the oxazole ring removed all VEGFR2 inhibition. The 2-methoxy-5-ethyl sulfone aniline, as mentioned earlier, was thought to impart increased potency by virtue of the methoxy substituent sitting in a small hydrophobic pocket, coupled with a sulfone oxygen accepting a hydrogen bond from the backbone nitrogen of Asn 923. In the model, the 5-phenyl group orientates toward the back of the pocket. A vacant lipophilic pocket exists at the rear of the binding site and it was predicted that aromatic meta-substitution at the 5-phenyl ring would access this site. This region has been previously observed to be occupied by small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and interactions in this region are capable of affording distinct selectivity profiles to a given inhibitor.15,18-20 A similar region is occupied by Gleevec in its binding to the Abl kinase, as shown in Figure 1.17 The region to the center-right of the binding site, in the vicinity of Val 848 and Lys 868 and typically occupied by the ribose moiety of ATP, was also sterically acces-

sible. This was potentially a favorable binding site for smaller aliphatic or carbonyl groups, again via meta substitition but in the alternative orientation. To explore this a series consisting of aliphatic, carbonyl, and aromatic substituents was prepared via Stille or Suzuki palladium couplings of 5-(3-bromophenyl)oxazole 34 (Scheme 3). Small substitutions, as exemplified by ethyl and keto derivatives 35 and 36, did not yield inhibitors with favorable cellular activities (see Table 3). However, aromatic substitution, particularly the o-fluoro- or ochloro-substituted phenyl groups (oxazoles 44 and 45), resulted in inhibitors with a 7-fold increase in cellular inhibition compared with compound 21. These oxazoles, 44 and 45, possess the best cellular potency in this series, and evidence that their efficacy is driven by VEGFR2 inhibition is shown by a >20-fold selectivity for inhibiting VEGF- versus b-FGF-driven HUVEC proliferation. In general, there was a moderate correlation between VEGFR2 enzyme inhibition and inhibition of HUVEC cellular proliferation, as evidenced in Figure 2, with a correlation coefficient of 0.63. A couple of outliers had good enzyme potencies but were inactive in cells (oxazoles 36 and 41), while a couple more were somewhat more active in cells than would have been predicted from their enzyme inhibitions (oxazoles 44 and 45). There does not appear to an easily identifiable reason for this, as the outliers have lipophilicities similar to those of others in this series and showed reasonable in vitro cell permeabilites (Papp values >50 nm/s in

MDCK cells with good mass balance). The average selectivity observed for VEGF- versus b-FGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC cells for compounds in this series was greater than 10-fold (see Figure 3). Pharmacokinetics and in Vivo Efficacy. The 2-pyridyl-substituted oxazole 39 was selected on the basis of its solubility and mouse pharmacokinetic profile for in vivo evaluation in mouse xenografts. To obtain optimal exposure via oral dosing, a salt screen was conducted on oxazole 39. In 40% SBE- -cyclodextrin in 0.05 M methanesulfonic acid at pH 2.3, the free base had poor solubility (<1 mg/mL), which could be improved by conversion to the citrate, hydrochloride, sulfate, and tosylate salts (1-2 mg/mL). However, conversion to the mono- and bis-mesylate salts gave the best solubilities at >10 mg/mL. Oral administration to mice of an aqueous solution of the bis-mesylate salt of oxazole 39 at 100 mg/kg resulted in an AUC (0-8 h) of 102 µg h/mL with a Cmax at 4 h of 35 µM (average of two mice). This represented an 8-fold increase in AUC compared to the free base of oxazole 39 dosed as a suspension in 0.5% HPMC with 0.1% Tween 80. The pharmacokinetics of the bis-mesylate salt of oxazole 39

was further characterized in the rat and dog. The PK parameters are summarized in Table 4. Oxazole 39 showed reasonable in vitro metabolic stability data (turnover in mouse and rat S9 liver fractions after 30 min at 1 µM was 2 and 29%, respectively); thus, the low oral bioavailability is likely due to poor permeability and/or solubility, although metabolism could be a contributing factor. In vivo efficacy was measured by the ability to inhibit the growth of established HT29 human colon tumor xenografts in nude mice. The bis-mesylate salt of oxazole 39 dosed orally once per day at either 30 or 100 mg/kg (free base equivalent) in water resulted in 43 and 55% smaller tumor, respectively, compared to vehicle control following 26 days of dosing. There was no body weight loss or other obvious signs of toxicity. By comparison, in our hands anilinoquinazoline 2 resulted in 61 and 81% inhibition of tumor growth at 30 and 100 mg/kg in the same model dosing orally once per day. As support that the observed inhibition of xenograft growth is working through an antiangiogenic rather than an antitumor mechanism, oxazole 39 has low inhibitory activity against the proliferation of HT29 cells in vitro with an IC50 of 4.5 µM. Inhibition of additional targets to VEGFR2 that might be contributing to the observed antiangiogenic effects such as src cannot be ruled out, although oxazole 39 is not potent against the angiogenesis-related kinases Tie-2, PDGFR, and EphB4 (see Table 6). X-ray Crystal Structures. To confirm the binding mode of the 2-anilino-5-phenyloxazoles, the crystal structures of oxazoles 39 and 46 complexed with VEGFR2 were obtained (Table 5). The oxazole core and the 2-methoxy-5-ethyl sulfone aniline bind as predicted from

a The concentration of ATP and kinase-specific biotinylated peptide in each assay was below the apparent Km of the respective substrate. Inhibitions of VEGFR1, -2, and -3, Src, PDGFR1 , and Tie2 were evaluated by the homologous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) format; inhibitions of CDK2, GSK3, PLK1, EphB4, EGFR, and ErbB2 were evaluated by the scintillation proximity assay format (SPA). Inhibitions of p38 and ITK were evaluated by the fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay. CDK4 and c-FMS inhibitions were measured by plate capture and filtration binding, respectively.

the homology model, with clear density visible for the core and aniline portions in both structures. The crystal structure of oxazole 46, possessing a m-3-pyridine group, showed the pyridyl group residing in the back lipophilic pocket (Figure 4). The 3-pyridyl nitrogen is proximal to the carboxylic acid of Glu885 at the rear of this pocket. No water-mediated interactions were observed; thus, the close distance implies a direct hydrogen bond via protonation of either the glutamic acid side chain or the pyridine nitrogen. Interestingly, the crystal structure of oxazole 39 with VEGFR2 (Figure 5) shows the same core interactions, but the m-2-pyridine group, however, was found to be orientated in multiple conformations, with no clear density visible for this portion of the ligand. The m-2pyridine appears to exist in at least two conformations, one toward the center-right position and a second conformation that projects the group into the back lipophilic pocket in a manner similar to that of oxazole 46 (Figure 4). Given that the two X-ray structures also differ in the sulfonamide side chain (ethyl versus cyclopropyl methyl), the possibility that the m-3-pyridine group is driven into the back of the binding site due to steric interfer-

IC50's for VEGFR2 inhibition of 22 and 38 nM, respectively, indicating that the energy for both binding modes is comparable. The activation loop is disordered between residues 1046 and 1065 in both crystal structures, indicating that residues beyond this region are not contributing directly to the binding affinity of these ligands. Asp1044 and Phe1045 are similarly positioned in both structures with the phenylanine side chain packing beneath the meta-substituted phenyl ring, while the aspartate side chain is facing away from the ligand, making no direct interactions. Kinase and Cellular Selectivities. Oxazoles 39, 44, and 45 serve as representative examples for this series regarding selectivity against other kinases, with similar potencies against both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 and a modest drop in potency for VEGFR1 (Table 6). Weak activities were observed for EphB4 and PDGFR1 and Tie-2, the other angiogenesis kinases assayed. Of the other kinases examined, comparable activity was seen for Src and ITK. Evidence that cellular activity resulted from activity at the desired target was showed by comparison of the inhibition of VEGF- versus bFGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC cells. A 10-fold or better window was typically observed for this oxazole class. For example, oxazole 39 had IC50's of 0.37 and 5.8 µM for VEGF- and bFGF-induced HUVEC proliferation, respectively. Conclusions We have identified 2-anilino-5-aryloxazole derivatives as a novel class of potent VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors with good enzymatic and cellular activities. Optimization of both aryl rings yielded oxazole 45 with improved enzymatic and cellular inhibitions compared with unsubstituted oxazole 5 of 30- and 60-fold, respectively, and with an in vitro profile comparable to those of lead VEGFR2 inhibitors 1 and 2 now in clinical trials (see Table 7). Oxazole 39, as the bis-mesylate salt, possessed good solubility and pharmokinetic profiles and showed moderate efficacy in preliminary in vivo xenograft studies. X-ray crystallography studies confirmed the proposed binding mode at the ATP binding site. Comparison of oxazoles 39 and 46, differing only by a shift in position of the nitrogen on a pyridine ring from ortho to meta, revealed conformational differences in binding of the pyridine rings.

Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVEC) Proliferation Assay (BrdU Incorporation). HUVEC cells and EGM-MV (endothelial cell growth mediumsmicrovascular) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). VEGF and bFGF were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-BrdU antibody was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). HUVECs were routinely maintained in EGM-MV medium and were used within passage 7. HUVECs were plated at a density of 2500 cells/well in M199 medium containing 5% FBS (Hyclone) in a type I collagen-

Harris et al. coated plate (Becton Dickinson). The plate was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The medium was removed by aspiration, and test compounds were added to each well in a volume of 0.1 mL/well in serum-free M199 medium. Compound concentrations ranged from 1.5 nM to 30 µM. The plate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Another 0.1 mL of serum-free M199 medium containing BSA and VEGF (or bFGF) was added to give a final concentration of 0.1% BSA and 10 ng/mL VEGF (0.3 ng/mL bFGF). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. BrdU was added to each well after the first 48 h to give a concentration of 10 µM. The colorimetric ELISA assay was performed according to manufacturer's (Roche Molecular Sciences) instructions, with detection by absorbance reading at 450 nm. Results were plotted as concentration of test compound vs absorbance to give an IC50 value for inhibition of BrdU incorporation. Pharmacokinetics in Mouse, Rat, and Dog. Oxazole 39 was administered orally to male CD mice (n ) 2) and male Sprague-Dawley rats (n ) 3) via oral gavage at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg and by intravenous injection to rats at a dose volume of 5 mL/kg. Oxazole 39 was administered orally to male beagle dogs (n ) 2) via oral gavage and by intravenous injection at a dose volume of 0.5 mL/kg. The blood samples were placed on wet ice, and plasma was collected after centrifugation. Plasma samples were stored frozen at -20 °C until time of analysis. Plasma samples were prepared by protein precipitation with four volumes of acetonitrile (200 µL) per 50 µL of plasma sample. Samples were analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/mass spectrometric analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by PKCal 2.0. Antitumor Activity against HT29 Colon Carcinoma Xenograft Model. HT29 tumors were initiated by injection of tumor cell suspension subcutaneously in 8-12 week old female nude mice. Mice were randomized into groups of eight prior to treatment when tumors reached a volume of 50-60 mm3 (9 days after implantation). Animals were treated with oxazole 39 (30 or 100 mg/kg) or vehicle (in 0.5% HPMC, 0.1% Tween 80 in sterile water), administered once daily by oral gavage. Tumor volume was measured twice weekly by calipers, using the formula (length × width2 × 0.5), where length was the longest diameter across the tumor, and width was the corresponding perpendicular. Tumor growth inhibition was calculated by mean change in tumor volume of control and treated groups. All animal studies were performed under approved protocols from the institutional animal care and use committee. Crystallography of VEGFR2 Ligand Complexes. Protein expression and purification of human VEGFR2 was carried out as described by McTigue et al.21,22 Protein-ligand complexes were obtained by combining 100 µL of the protein solution (VEGFR: 10 mg/mL, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, and 10 mM NaCl) with 3 µL of a 50 mM compound in DMSO and allowing the mixture to stand for 90 min at 20 °C. Crystals of the complex were obtained using the hanging drop method using drops composed of 1:l of the protein/ligand complex and 4 µL of a reservoir solution (100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.1 M ammonium sulfate, and 2% PEG550). X-ray data was collected from cryogenically preserved crystals using a Mar165 detector at Sector 17 of the Advanced Photon Source. Crystal structures were solved using the Amore molecular replacement program23 with an unligand structure of VEGFR2 as the search model. The structures were built using the program O,24 and initial refinement was carried out with the CNX program.25 Map generation, density modification, and final refinement was carried out using programs from the CCP4 Suite.23
