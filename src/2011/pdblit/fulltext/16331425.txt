The product of gene locus BB0938 from Bordetella bronchiseptica (Swiss-Prot ID: Q7WNU7_BORBR; NESG target ID: BoR11; Wunderlich et al., 2004; Pfam ID: PF03476) is a 128-residue protein of unknown function. This broadly conserved protein family is found in eubacteria and eukaryotes. Using triple resonance NMR techniques, we have determined 98% of backbone and 94% of side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments. The chemical shift and 3J(HN­Ha) scalar coupling data reveal a b topology with a seven-residue helical insert, bbbbbbbbab. BMRB deposit with accession number 6693. Reference: Wunderlich et al.

H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments for Escherichia coli ytfP, a member of the broadly conserved UPF0131 protein domain family

DOI 10.1007/s10858-005-2597-z

Protein ytfP from Escherichia coli (Swiss-Prot ID: YTFP_ECOLI; NESG target ID: ER111; Wunderlich et al., 2004) is a 113-residue member of the UPF0131 protein family (Pfam ID: PF03674) of unknown function. This domain family is found in organisms from all three kingdoms, archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes. Using triple resonance NMR techniques, we have determined 97% of backbone and 91% of side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments. The chemical shift and 3J(HN­Ha) scalar coupling data reveal a mixed a/b topology, babbabbb. BMRB deposit with Accession No. 6448. Reference: Wunderlich et al. (2004) Proteins, 56, 181­187. James M.
