Secondary structure determination for a-neurotoxin from Dendroaspis polylepis polylepis based on sequence-specific 'H-nuclear-magnetic-resonance assignments
Alexander M . LABHARDT, Eng-Hiang HUNZIKER-KWIK and Kurt WUTHRICH Institut fur Molekularbiologie und Biophysik, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Honggerberg, Zurich (Received June 29, 1988) - EJB 88 0774

Sequence-specific assignments are presented for the polypeptide backbone protons and a majority of the amino-acid-side-chain protons of a-neurotoxin from Dendroaspispolylepis polylepis, and individual amide protonexchange rates with the solvent are reported. The secondary structure and the hydrogen-bonding patterns in the regular secondary structure elements are deduced from nuclear Overhauser effects and the sequence locations of the slowly exchanging amide protons. The molecule includes a three-stranded antiparallel P-sheet, and there are indications that two additional short chain segments are arranged in an antiparallel P-sheet. These structural elements are similar, but not identical, to either the secondary structure reported for erabutoxin b in single crystals, or the solution structure of cytotoxin CTXIIb from Naja mossambica mossambica. Neurotoxin from the venom of snakes of the Elapidae family are low-molecular-mass proteins which bind specifically to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in cholinergic synapses, thus blocking postsynaptic membrane depolarization. Over 60 homologous snake toxins have been sequenced which can be classified either as short neurotoxins with four disulfide bonds, or long neurotoxins with five disulfide bonds, where the pairing for four disulfides is similar in all the neurotoxins [I - 31. Studies of neurotoxin conformation have been pursued with both X-ray diffraction in single crystals and NMR in solution [4 - 111. The molecular models, thus obtained, show that the homology of the primary structures carries over to the three-dimensional structures, but there is also evidence for structural disorder in the neurotoxin crystals and for differences between corresponding structures in crystals and in solution. Examples for this include the short neurotoxin erabutoxin b, where there are differences in side-chain orientations and the backbone arrangements of the peripheral loops between two different crystallographic maps [4, 61, and difficulties in the interpretation of the electron density maps near the tip of a long central loop [S]. Furthermore, residue H7 was reported to be on the molecular surface in both crystal structures [4 - 71, whereas such an orientation seems to be incompatible with chemical modification studies and NMR measurements in solution [8, 91, which both suggest that H7 is buried in the interior of the protein. For the long neurotoxin a-bungarotoxin there is evidence that the regular P-sheet structures extend over a longer stretch of the polypeptide chain in the structure in solution, determined by NMR, than in the crystal structure [I 11.

tendency of neurotoxins to adopt multiple, different conformations in different environments, we have started an NMR investigation of the short a-neurotoxin from Dendroaspis polylepispolylepis in aqueous solution. In this paper we report the sequence-specific 'H-NMR assignments for this protein, and the secondary structure derived from NOES between different backbone protons, or between backbone protons and CP-protons, and from the slowed exchange for hydrogenbonded amide protons with the solvent [12, 131. MATERIALS AND METHODS Following established procedures [14, 151 a-neurotoxin was isolated from 2 g dry venom purchased from Sigma. The protein was isolated and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on Amberlite CGH-50. A column of 60cm x 2.5 cm was equilibrated withO.l M ammonium bicarbonate solution at pH 8.0. The 2 g venom was dissolved in 20 ml 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate solution (pH 8.0) and applied to this column. A linear gradient of 3.6 1 0.1 -0.475 M ammonium bicarbonate solution at pH 8.0 was used to elute the column at a flow rate of 24ml/h at 5°C. The eluate was monitored at 280nm; the major protein fraction was collected, then dialyzed against water and lyophilized. This fraction was redissolved in 10 ml 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 and applied to a Sephadex G-50 fine (Pharmacia) column of 80 cm x 3.8 cm. Elution with 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate solution pH 8.0 at a flow rate of 7.5 ml/h yielded three peaks, where the most retarded fraction was a-neurotoxin, with a yield of 4% (by mass) of the venom. When checking the temperature and pH ranges where a-neurotoxin solutions contain the native protein, 'H-NMR and C D spectra indicated that no major structural changes of the toxin occur at 36°C between pH 3.0-7.5. At pH 4.0 structural integrity is preserved up to a temperature of 60°C. At this pH no precipitation was observed at any concentration between 7.5-55 mg/ml. A toxin solution at pH 4.0, which was exposed to 55 "C, contained approximately 10% degraded

296 material after 36 h. Based on these observations, solutions for the NMR assignments and the structural investigations contained 8 mM protein at pH 4.2. The solvent was either a mixture of 90% H 2 0 and 10% 2 H 2 0 ,or 99.98% 'HzO. pH values were adjusted by adding HCl/NaOH, or 2HC1/Na02H, respectively, using the pH meter reading without any corrections for isotope effects. Protein samples in 2 H 2 0 , with the labile protons completely exchanged against deuterium, were prepared by heating the solution to 45°C for 15 min, freezedrying and twice redissolving in 2 H 2 0and lyophilizing. All 2D 'H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker WM 500 spectrometer. Absorption mode COSY [16, 171, 2QFCOSY [18, 191, NOESY [20] and RELAYED-COSY [21] spectra were recorded using the standard procedures. The mixing time T,,, in NOESY was always 200 ms, with a random variation of k 5% for suppression of J peaks [22]. The tuned delay in RELAYED-COSY was 30 ms. The strong water signal in H 2 0 solution was saturated by continuous preirradiation during the relaxation delay and by gated irradiation during t l [13]. The carrier was placed in the center of the spectrum and quadrature detection was used [16]. In H 2 0 the spectral width was 6.25 kHz and the tl delay increment was 80 ps; in ' H 2 0 the spectral width was 4.5 kHz and the tl increment was 111 ps. The number of tl values varied from 177 (NOESY in 'H20) to 699 (2QF-COSY in 2H20). COSY and NOESY spectra in H 2 0 were measured interleafed when used for sequential assignments, to eliminate artifacts from short-term instabilities [19]. Phasing of the spectra was carried out as described by Neuhaus et al. [19]. Apodization of the time domain data involved multiplication by a phase-shifted sine bell along t 2 and a phase-shifted sine squared bell along t l . Prior to Fourier transformation, the time domain data were zero-filled to 8192 points in t2 and 2048 points in t l . The NOESY spectra were processed by dividing the first FID by 2 to suppress artifactual t l ridges [23]. Amide proton exchange rates were measured by NOESY using the following procedure adapted from [24]. The fully protonated sample was lyophilized from H 2 0 , pH 3.9, and sufficiciit NaCl was added to produce a 10 mM salt concentration in a final volume of 0.4 ml. Redissolving for the kinetic studies at a protein concentration of 43 mg/ml was done at 2°C. The NMR tube was then rapidly inserted into the preshimmed spectrometer, equilibrated at 20 "C, and data acquisition was started after some additional shimming to obtain a NOESY spectrum with 200 tl values in 6.75 h. Eight additional spectra were acquired after various exchange times. The sample was kept at 20 "C over the entire exchange period of 260 h, both outside the spectrometer and during acquisition. The following considerations prompted us to use NOESY rather than COSY [24] for the studies of NH exchange rates [25]. In contrast to COSY, which produces antiphase crosspeak signals with zero integrated intensity, the NOESY crosspeak heights are defined by the signal amplitudes measured at t l = 0. If an amide proton is exchanged in the course of a NOESY experiment, this will therefore not affect its crosspeak height but only the line width. Nwerical simulations with a NOESY spectrum of a-neurotoxin were used to calibrate these effects. For example, in a data set recorded during 12 h the t l time domain was multiplied with an exponential decay in such a way that the data were truncated after 50 min of measuring time. This treatment increased the cross-peak widths along w1 but left the peak heights invariant. Another advantage arises since NOESY spectra with long mixing times usually produce multiple cross peaks for most amide protons. One or several well-separated peaks may thus be available for the exchange measurements, even for amino acid residues with severe overlap in the NH and H" regions. Finally, the NOESY spectra of partly exchanged a-neurotoxin also proved useful for the resonance assignments and the secondardy structure determination, since a sizeable number of sequential and longer-range NOES with slowly exchanging amide protons could be identified after the disappearance of cross peaks with more rapidly exchanging amide protons.

RESULTS Identification of the amino acid spin systems comprised o nonlubile protons f The a-neurotoxin contains 25 AMX spin systems corresponding to C"H-CPH2 fragments of C, N, D, S, H, Y and W, 18 long side chains of E, Q, P, R and K, and 17 unique spin systems corresponding to 5 G, 1 A, 5 T, 2 V and 4 I. The analysis of the spin systems started out with the region of a 2QF-COSY spectrum containing H"-H" cross peaks of G and H"-HP cross peaks of other residues (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1 nearly all residues of a-neurotoxin are represented, the exceptions being I36, 137, R39, K59 and Y62, where the chemical shifts of either H" or HP are outside of the region shown (Table I), and S8, A12, E38 and G40 for other reasons discussed in the following. For clarity of the presentation, the sequencespecific assignments obtained as the final results are used in this, and all the following figures, to identify individual peaks. In Fig. 1, four AX spin systems pertaining to four glycines stand out clearly, by the lack of passive couplings and the large active coupling constant, 2Jaa M 3 5 Hz. Four threonines could be recognized from the fact that the H"-HP cross peaks have splitting patterns unlike those of any of the other cross peaks [19,26]. The H"-HP cross peak of the fifth system (T35) overlaps with another cross peak and is less typical. However, for all five threonines the assignments were confirmed by RELAYED-COSY in 2 H 2 0 ,which showed both Ha-CH3 and HP-CH, cross peaks for all five systems. Identification of the two valines started from COSY cross peaks connecting the methyl doublets to the P-proton. For V46 the a-proton was located by 2QF-COSY (Fig. l), for V50 by RELAYEDCOSY in 2 H 2 0on the basis of the two Ha-CH3cross peaks. The isoleucines were initially identified as CaH-CPH-CYH3 partial systems (I2 and I52 are seen in Fig. 1). I36 stands out because of the extreme high-field chemical shift of its j-proton (Table 1). Further connections to the y-methylene protons could in no case be made by COSY peaks from the P-protons. Therefore we started again from the &methyl region, where three of the four isoleucine methyl triplets could be identified from the large splitting of the COSY cross peaks, and the fourth &methyl resonance was located by a RELAYEDCOSY HP-C6H3 cross peak. The partial spin systems H"-HPCYH3 and CYH2-C6H3 were connected by RELAYED-COSY for 12 and 152, by NOESY for 136, and by exclusion for 137. The remaining peaks in Fig. 1 were grouped into corresponding H"-HP, H"-HP' and HP-HP'cross peaks. Using that the intrinsic HP chemical shifts for serine, other AMX spin systems and long side chains fall into different regions, and that 2JPPis outstandingly small for serine [13], these three types of spin systems were tentatively distinguished. Overall, one glycine (later identified as G40), the only alanine, one AMX system (S8) and one long side chain were not observed at this stage.

Fig. 1.2QF-COSY spectrum s f a n 8 m M a-neurotoxin solution in ' H 2 O at 36"C,p2H = 4.2, after complete exchange of the labile protons. The region containing most H"-HDcross peaks is shown. For clarity two different contour plots were combined, one using two levels with relative heights 1 and 5 , and the other one using two levels with relative heights of 5 and 20. Positive and negative levels are reproduced without distinction. The cross peaks are identified with the amino acid type and the sequence number obtained as the final result of the assignment procedure

Identifications of the aromatic spin systems were obtained by 2QF-COSY in 'H20. Fig. 2 shows a NOESY spectrum with the connectivities for the single tryptophan (W29) and all the tyrosines except Y62, where the cross peak is very near to the diagonal (Table 1). In addition Fig. 2 shows NH-NH cross peaks of the side chain amide groups for N5, Q7, N22 and 456. Sequence-specificassignments for the aromatic rings and the side-chain amide groups were obtained through NOE to HB,or HY, respectively [13], in conjunction with the sequential assignments. The 2H-4H cross peaks for histidine are outside the spectral region of Fig. 2. Only two of these cross peaks were observed in 2QF-COSY in 'HzO, and only two 2H lines could be identified in the one-dimensional spectra.

(data not shown). No amide proton lines were at this stage observed for the spin systems which were later assigned to S8, A12, H32, E38 and G40. Sequential resonance assignments Following the procedures described, for example, in [13, 27, 281, sequential relations were established using the connectivities daN(Fig. 5A) or d (Fig. 5B). Fig 6 shows that " sequential connectivities were observed throughout, except at S8, H32, where the NH resonance could not be seen, and E38. The following remarks concern some special observations made during the sequential assignments. Two strong NOE relating resonances at 4.15 pprn and 4.05 ppm to the NH of T9 remained unassigned. These two resonance positions are also related in 2QF-COSY (Fig. I), where the cross-peak pattern suggests that three protons are involved, two of which are strongly coupled. Clearly, the indication is that these resonances correspond to the missing spin system of S8, but since no correlations with an amide proton could be established they were not included in Table 1. While the spin system of A12 was not unambiguously identified, a resonance at 2.16 ppm coupled to a methyl doublet at 1.10 ppm was left unassigned, and could not be related to an amide proton by COSY or RELAYED-COSY. These lines were now found to have NOE to an amide proton at 7.82 ppm, which also showed a NOE to H" of R l l , and to NH of T13. On this basis an assignment for A12 was established (Table 1). The assignment of a NH proton resonance to E38 was based on the observation of NOESY cross peaks between this

Completion of the spin systems with the labile protons The COSY fingerprint of a-neurotoxin (Fig. 3) contains 48 cross peaks originating from backbone NH-Ha connectivities. All these cross peaks could be attributed to one of the sidechain spin systems identified in ' H 2 0 solution, either by COSY on the basis of unique Ha chemical shifts (28 spin systems) or by relayed connectivities to the B-protons (Fig. 4). C3 and Q56 have nearly identical H a and NH chemical shifts at 36°C (Fig. 3), but the presence of two peaks was clearly seen because of the largely different amide proton exchange rates (see Fig. 10 below). The amide proton resonances were further identified for the following residues which are not seen in Fig. 3: Q7, N22, and R39 from RELAYED-COSY to the fl-protons (Fig. 4), H6 and T9 from COSY at 20°C, where the Ha-NH cross peaks of Q7 and N22 were also observed

Because of its unusual high-field amide proton shift at 6.24 ppm and the degeneracy of its two a-protons at 3.82 ppm, G40 was not identified in the early stage of the work. In NOESY spectra acquired at 36°C in HzO the sequential HaNH NOESY peak with R39 was bleached due to the water presaturation, but an unambiguous identification was possible from the NOESY spectra measured in 'HzO during H/ 'H exchange.

The facts that strong sequential NOE corresponding to daNwere observed for nearly the entire polypeptide chain and that even at the long mixing time used here only few NOE corresponding to dNN were seen (Fig. 6), clearly shows that a-neurotoxin contains predominantly extended j3-sheet secondary structure [12,13,29]. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the majority of the spin-spin coupling con-

stants ' J K N is larger than 8 Hz [13, 301. Using NOESY in 2 H 2 0 , numerous long-range NOE duu(i,) were observed j (Fig. 7), which are typical for the formation of antiparallel P-sheets [12, 131. Additional long-range, interstrand NOE involving amide protons and a-protons were identified in NOESY spectra recorded in H 2 0 . In Fig. 8 all these data are collected in a diagonal plot. It is readily seen from this presentation [ 131 that a-neurotoxin contains a three-stranded antiparallel P-sheet involving approximately the residues 22 42 and 50 - 57. Furthermore there is a P-sheet-like structure near the N-terminus, which has also close contacts with C-terminal residues, and there are no helical secondary structures. Amide proton exchange Following the procedures described in Materials and Methods nine NOESY recordings were started at the following times after dissolving a-neurotoxin in 'H20: 0.8 h, 7.5 h, 14.3 h, 21 h, 28 h, 69 h, 76 h, 157 h and 252 h. The hydrogendeuterium exchange rates were evaluated from these NOESY data by two different procedures. (a) The most rapidly exchanging amide protons that could still be observed in 2 H 2 0 solution, i.e. those of N5, 136, K45, K46, K47, V50 and 152, had already disappeared from the spectrum when the second NOESY acquisition was started. These resonances showed cross peaks with appreciable broadening along w1 in the first NOESY experiment, which was analysed by comparison to the peak widths in corresponding spectrum simulations. (b) In all other cases a single, well-isolated cross peak pertaining to a particular NH was selected, which was most often the duN sequential cross peak, and its height in successive NOESY experiments was plotted against the exchange time. These

exchange curves were then analysed in terms of a single exponential decay, using a least-square approximation. This mode of data collection is illustrated in Fig. 9. In NOESY spectra recorded at different exchange times, cross sections along w1 were taken at a 02-position where the amide proton resonances of two amino acid residues were exactly overlapped (for details see the figure caption). Fig. 10 provides a survey of all the individual amide proton exchange rates measured. The dead time of the experiment used was about 1 h, so that amide protons with an exchangerate constant larger than 1.5 x min-' could not be observed. Based on previous experience [12, 13, 241, these data provide independent evidence for the formation of a threestranded P-sheet (Fig. 8) involving approximately residues 23-29 as the central strand, and the segments 36-42 and 51 - 57 as the peripheral strands. Furthermore, the formation of hydrogen-bonded secondary structure elements involving the N- and C-terminal tetrapeptide segments is indicated by the exchange data. DISCUSSION The schematic, planar models of two hydrogen-bonded secondary structures in a-neurotoxin shown in Fig. 11 can accommodate all NOE constraints in Fig. 8, and are largely compatible also with the amide proton exchange data (Fig. 10). On the other hand all NOES implicated by the structures in Fig. 11 were not observed, mainly for the following reasons. In the central P-sheet the NH resonances of the amino acid pairs (29, 36), (24, 55) and (26, 53) are separated by less than 0.1 ppm (see Table l), which makes the detection of possible cross-strand NOE difficult, and the cross-strand NOE darN 36) would coincide with the strong intraresidue (30,

(A) dGIN connectivities. Solid lines connect the NH-H" COSY cross peak positions. which are identified by squares, with the sequential NOESY cross peaks for the following peptide segments: C3-N5, T14-Kl5, S16-E20 (note that residues 18 and 19 are deleted in the numeration used in Fig. 6), S23-D31, C41-G42, 152-SS7, D58-KS9. The isolated NOESY cross peak coresponding to dzN (37, 38) is identified with a star. Note that for most residues the intra-residue NOE dN.(i. i) are seen inside the squares. The sequence locations of the amide protons are indicated with the vertical lines, and the two arrows on the right indicate that the NH positions for residues S23 and S57 are outside of the spectral region shown here (see Table 1).

A filled square in the position (i,j ) of the plane indicates that between the two residues in the sequence locations i and j , one or several of the NOE corresponding to daa(i,j), d"(i,j), d&J(ir , dNa(i,j ) , dpN(i,j ) or dNP(ir) were observed.

biguously determined by the long-range, interstrand NOE to the neighbouring protons. All the hydrogen bonds expected for a regular antiparallel P-sheet formed by the three polypeptide segments in Fig. 11A were thus unambiguously characterized. The following additional polypeptide segments have slow amide proton exchange rates, indicating intramolecular hydrogen bonding. First, in the N-terminal region R1 to C17 the long-range NOE daa ( 2 , 16), dNa( 3 , 16), and dNs

(4, 14) position the four slowly exchanging amide protons of residues 3 , 5 , 1 5 and 17 in such a way that they form a regular P-sheet-like bonding pattern (Fig. 1 1 B). As mentioned earlier, several close 'H-'H contacts that would be expected for a regular antiparallel P-sheet with this peptide segment were not observed. An extended chain beyond N5 would automatically put the slowly exchanging amide proton of 4 into register 7 with the carbonyl oxygen of R11, but a strong sequential

Fig. 9. Illustration o the analysis o the NOESY spectra used to measure amideproton exchange rates (see Materials and Methodsfor experimentul f f details). NOESY experiments were started at the times indicated with the individual cross sections after dissolving cc-neurotoxin in 'H 20, p2H 3.9, t = 20°C. The cross sections along w1 shown here correspond to w 2 = 9.24 ppm, which is the amide proton chemical shift at 20°C for both C17 and C55. On the left the complete cross sections are shown. The sequential and intraresidue NOE at 75.9 h of exchange time show that the slowly exchanging amide proton at w 2 = 9.24 ppm belongs to (25.5. Only peaks involving this amide proton are labeled. On the right the differences between the cross sections at the indicated times and the one at 75.9 h exchange time are plotted. The sequential and intraresidue NOE identify the more rapidly exchanging amide proton at w 2 = 9.24 ppm as that of C17

Fig. 10. Backbone amide proton exchange rates, k, (min- '), plotted on a logarithmic scale vs the amino acid sequence o cc-neurotoxin (note the f deletion ofresidues 18 and 19 in the numeration used). For the residues marked with an upward arrow, the exchange wa too fast for the amide proton line to be seen in 'HzO at 20°C and p2H 3.9. Downward arrows indicate that the exchange was too slow to be measurable within a time period of 252 h

NOE d (5, 6) indicates a deviation from the extended chain " conformation between residues 5 and 6. Similarly, the acceptor groups for the slowly exchanging amide protons of T2 and Y4 have not been identified. Overalr a decision on the exact size of this P-sheet fragment must be postponed to the determination of the complete structure, using distance geometry calculations 1131. Second, the four C-terminal amide protons all have slow NH exchange rates (Fig. 10). NOE corresponding to short distances d (2, 59) and daN(3, 59) " locate K59 close to the N-terminal P-sheet and identify the carbonyl oxygen of I2 as the acceptor group. The bonding

partners of the other three slowly exchanging amide protons 60-62 cannot be identified at this stage. Third, five amide protons in the segment 45 - 52 exchange measurably slowly (Fig. 10). The local conformation leading to their shielding from solvent contact could not be deduced with the presently employed empirical pattern recognition approach for secondary structure identification. In the course of the present investigation it became clear that certain segments of the a-neurotoxin polypeptide chain could be much more precisely characterized than others, both by an essentially complete set of sequential NOE as well as

(B) Similar representation of a /?-sheet-like structure involving N- and C-terminal segments of the polypeptide chain. The dotted arrows indicate NOE from S16 /?CHz to backbone protons of I2 and C3, and from T14 /?CH to aCH of Y4

by numerous longer-range NOE. Now that the secondary structure has been determined, it turns out that these two classes of chain segments are spatially correlated. The spectrally well defined sequences are located in the threestranded P-sheet (Fig. 11A) and near the C-terminus, but excluding Y62. The least well defined part was the segment from H6 to T13, where the ring proton resonances of H6 were not observed and no resonance assignments were obtained for S8. N o long-range NOE involving backbone protons of these residues were obtained. The same holds for the residues P44 to G51. It should be added that for both of these segments long-range side-chain contacts are evident from the NOE measurements, so that a more precise chaiacterization of these molecular regions can be expected from a more complete data analysis using distance geometry calculations [13]. It is interesting that in the refined crystal structure of the homologous protein erabutoxin b [7], outstandingly large temperature factors were reported for residues 7 - 11 and 42 - 51, which coincides very closely with the least well-defined regions in the solution structure of a-neurotoxin. Further comparisons

of the secondary structure elements reported for the crystal 1 structures of erabutoxin b [4 - 7 with the a-neurotoxin structure in Fig. 11 indicate the following differences. a) In erabutoxin b hydrogen bonds were identified between residues 31 and 34, and between 32 and 33 [4, 51. For a-neurotoxin in solution the rapid NH exchange rates for D31 and G34 show that there are no stable hydrogen bonds between these two residues. No statement is possible concerning a possible hydrogen bond with the amide proton of H32, since the resonance of this amide proton remained unidentified. The inability to see the amide proton of H32 may indicate a high degree of flexibility in this peptide segment. This might then also account for the rapid exchange of the neighbouring amide proton of D31 out of a structure which, on a time average, clearly has a P-sheet-type conformation (Fig. 11A). From NMR studies [31] as well as from the low electron density observed by Tsernoglou et al. [5],it was concluded that the tip of the central loop is rather mobile or disordered. In the recently published refinement [7] of the erabutoxin b structure of Low et al. [6] an alternative hydrogen bonding

305 scheme is proposed, with the amide proton of residue 34 bound to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 31. From our solution data we know that in a-neurotoxin such a hydrogen bond is definitely not stably formed. b) Relative to the erabutoxin b crystal structure, Fig. 11A includes the three additional hydrogen bonds from the amide protons of S23, G42, and S57 to the carbonyl oxygens of G42, G23, and N22, respectively. These hydrogen bonds were all absent in the early descriptions of the erabutoxin b crystal structures [4- 6 and the recently refined structure [7] includes 1 only the bond from the amide proton of G42 to the carbonyl oxygen of S23. In a-neurotoxin G42 is among the residues with the most slowly exchanging amide protons in solution (Fig. 10). For the other two of these hydrogen bonds the halftime for amide proton exchange is only about 10 h at 20°C for S57, and even shorter for S23. However, these exchange rates are comparable to those of the other terminal hydrogen bonds in the three-stranded P-sheet (Fig. 1 1 A), i.e. for the amide protons of Y28 and 136. These increased exchange rates are indicative of fraying of the P-sheet at both ends. Because of the homology between cytotoxins and short neurotoxins, which includes the four disulfide bonds [l - 31, the crystal structure of erabutoxin B has sometimes been considered representative also for the cytotoxins [l -31. A more direct comparison is now possible, since an NMR investigation of the cytotoxins CTXIIa and CTXIIb from Naja mossambica rnossambica has recently been presented [33]. Depending on the alignment, 20 - 22 of the total of 60 amino acid residues are strictly conserved relative to a-neurotoxin. In the structure of Fig. 11A a conserved band of residues extends across the three j-strands, from C5453- C5554 to C242' -Y2522-K2623 to R3936-G4037-C4138, and the structure of Fig. 11 B contains the four conserved residues C33, K1512, C1714 and K5958 in identical locations (for ease of reference the corresponding sequence numbers for CTXIIb used in [33] are added as superscripts). Comparison of the secondary structures in Fig. 11 with those of Fig. 10 in [33] shows that a-neurotoxin and cytotoxin CTXIIb both contain the structure element of Fig. 11 B, with the close approach between N-terminal and C-terminal residues. The structural similarity in this region includes also nearly identical patterns of slowly exchanging amide protons in the chain terminal peptide segments. In the three-stranded P-sheet the evolutionarily conserved central part (see above) has identical NOE and hydrogen bonding in both proteins. Differences are observed in the protruding loops. Beyond residue 2gZ5the central P-strand in a-neurotoxin is not hydrogen-bonded to the top strand (note the rapid amide proton exchange for R30 in Fig. 10; the corresponding residue R27 in CTXIIb is clearly hydrogen-bonded [33]). Conversely, the well-defined P-sheet formed by the residues 3431 to 3734 of the central strand in a-neurotoxin with the bottom strand (Fig. 11A) was not observed in CTXIIb. The trend to conformational polymorphism in homologous toxins referred to in the introduction is thus apparent also in the presently examined species, indicating again that generalizations on conformational features in these families of proteins should be advanced only with great care.
