to be essential for splicing in vivo ([3] and references therein; see Figure 1a,b). While some members of Lührmann's group were examining the interaction between U4 snRNA and the human 15.5 kDa protein, others were examining the protein components of the yeast U3 snoRNP in the hope of identifying additional proteins that bind the core C/D box sequence. As mentioned above, the snoRNAs are involved in ribosome biogenesis. The C/D box snoRNAs are one of two major classes of snoRNAs, the other being the H/ACA snoRNAs. The members of each class share characteristic conserved sequence elements and associate with common (core) binding proteins (reviewed in [6,7]). U3 is a member of the C/D box class of snoRNAs; it contains the conserved C box and D box sequences (Figure 1c) and binds the core proteins -- Nop1p/fibrillarin, Nop56P and Nop58p -- that are characteristic of members of this family. In their recent study, Watkins et al. [1] transformed yeast cells with an inducible gene encoding a tagged U3 molecule; on induction, the construct was transcribed and tagged U3 particles assembled in vivo. After demonstrating that these tagged particles were functional, and so presumably correctly assembled, they used the tag to isolate the tagged U3 particles. Examination of the proteins that co-purified with the tagged U3 RNPs revealed the expected C/D box core-binding proteins, Nop56p, Nop58p and Nop1p/fibrillarin, as well as Rrp9, a previously reported U3-specific protein. A small 13 kDa protein was also detected. Peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry identified the 13 kDa protein as Snu13p, the previously reported component of the yeast spliceosomal U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP [4,5] -- and the yeast ortholog of the U4 snRNA-binding 15.5 kDa protein that was already being studied in the Lührmann laboratory [3]. The interaction between Snu13p and U3 snoRNA was examined to determine if this protein is unique to U3, or if it also associates with other snoRNAs. The pattern of RNAs co-precipitating with Snu13p were found to be very similar to that of the RNAs co-precipitating with Nop1p. These observations indicated that, like Nop1p, Snu13p might be a C/D box core binding protein. The pattern of Snu13p-precipitated RNAs was quite different from the pattern of RNAs that co-precipitated with Gar1p, a core protein of H/ACA snoRNAs. This demonstrated specificity of Snu13p for binding the C/D box snoRNAs. Co-immunoprecipitations from HeLa cells using antibodies against the 15.5 kDa protein indicated that Snu13p/15.5 kDa

Small nuclear RNAs are involved in splicing pre-mRNA, while small nucleolar RNAs facilitate ribosome biogenesis. But these distinct particles may have more in common than was first apparent: some of their RNA components share a common RNA binding protein, a common RNA structure and perhaps a common origin.

The five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) together form the spliceosome, responsible for removing introns and joining exons to form mRNAs. The small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs), of which there are 75­100 in yeast and possibly as many as 200 in mammals, are involved in guiding the site-specific modification and facilitating processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). Recently, it has been reported [1] that these two sets of RNPs, which function in different nuclear environs and perform mechanistically distinct cellular functions, in fact share an RNA-binding protein component and have a common RNA structure, and may even have a common origin. RNA splicing is a complex process that results in the removal of introns from pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). The spliceosome consists of the five snRNAs -- U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 -- which associate with about 50 proteins (reviewed in [2]). Some of the protein components of the spliceosome are core RNA-binding proteins, shared by all the snRNPs, while others are specific for a given particle. In 1999, Reinhard Lührmann's group [3] identified a novel human 15.5 kDa protein that binds U4 snRNA. Database searches indicated that this protein is highly conserved throughout evolution, with apparent homologues in several other species. The yeast ortholog of the human 15.5 kDa protein is Snu13p, present in the U4/U6-U5 trisnRNP purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [4,5]. Functional analysis indicated the human 15.5 kDa protein is essential for the first step of splicing in vitro [3]. Comparisons of several U4 sequences facilitated the identification of a putative binding site for the 15.5 kDa protein. The sequence of the 5 stem­loop of U4 was found to be very well conserved, indicating that it might be a site of protein binding. Subsequent binding studies showed that the 15.5 kDa protein does bind to the 5 stem­loop of U4 snRNA, a region of U4 previously shown

protein associates with the C/D box snoRNAs in both yeast and human. Genetic depletion of the Snu13p protein from yeast cells was performed to examine the protein's role on cell growth as well as the effects upon snoRNA stability, prerRNA processing and spliceosomal snRNAs. Decreased levels of C/D box snoRNAs were seen within 4 hours of shifting cells to conditions that repressed Snu13p synthesis. By 8­12 hours, cell growth stopped, and at that time there was seen to be a decrease in the levels of all RNAs, including spliceosomal snRNAs, ribosomal RNAs and even the H/ACA snoRNAs. These results indicated that Snu13p is required for C/D box snoRNA stability, but perhaps also to maintain steady-state levels of a large and diverse pool of cellular RNAs. As the human 15.5 kDa protein homologous to Snu13p had been shown to interact directly with the 5 stem­loop of U4 snoRNA [3], Watkins et al. [1] examined the ability of recombinant 15.5 kDa protein to bind directly to the snoRNAs. They found that the 15.5 kDa protein could bind to each of the C/D box snoRNAs they examined, despite the fact that no obvious binding site was seen in the typical C/D box snoRNA motif (Figure 1c) [6,7]. The binding site for the 15.5 kDa protein on U4 snRNA had previously been shown to consist of two base-paired stems, interrupted by an asymmetric internal loop [3] (Figure 1a,b). Mutagenesis showed that the C/D box sequences of U3 snoRNA are essential for binding by the 15.5 kDa protein [1]. Watkins et al. therefore proposed an alternative structure for C/D box snoRNAs, in which the 3 end of the C box is base paired with the 5 end of the D box. This forms a stem-internal loop­stem structure virtually identical to that of the 15.5 kDa binding site on U4 snRNA (Figure 1b,d) [1]. The most striking similarity is in the internal loop. Nottrott et al. [3] identified a highly conserved GA at positions 6 and 7 of the U4 internal loop, and a conserved UGA at positions 3­5 that are essential for binding of the 15.5 kDa protein in vitro (Figure 1b). The highly conserved GA nucleotides in the U3 C box and D box fall precisely at the equivalent positions of the asymmetric internal loop proposed for the snoRNAs (Figure 1d). To test directly whether this structural motif encompassing the C/D box elements is sufficient for binding the 15.5 kDa protein, oligonucleotides with sequences corresponding to the C and D boxes of several mammalian snoRNAs were synthesized. The recombinant protein was found to bind the C/D box oligonucleotide sequences of each snoRNA as efficiently as it binds the corresponding U4 oligonucleotide sequence [1]. This provided the first direct evidence that the C and D boxes together form a single protein-binding motif.

(a) Interaction between U4 and U6 snRNAs. The diagram shows the position of the conserved Snu13p/15.5 kDa protein binding site (orange nucleotides) in U4, relative to the extensive base-paired interaction between U4 (black) and U6 (yellow). (b) Structure of the 5 stem­loop of U4 snRNA showing the conserved internal bulge. The sequences of nucleotide positions 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (orange) are essential for Snu13p/15.5 kDa binding. (c) Earlier structural motif for C/D box snoRNAs. SnoRNA (blue) with conserved C box and D box sequences (orange box). Nearly all C/D box snoRNAs have a terminal base-paired stem adjacent to the C and D box motifs. (d) C/D box snoRNA folded to form conserved internal bulge structure and showing relative position of the methylation guide sequence. The snoRNA (blue) can be folded such that the conserved GA nucleotides in the C box and D box elements (orange) fall at positions 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the internal bulge. The methylation guide sequence in the snoRNA is located 5 of the D box and consists of 10­21 nt of complementarity with rRNA (green). The position in rRNA to be methylated (green mN) is always base paired to the position five nt 5 of the D box (relative to the snoRNA).

These findings have several important implications. First, the direct binding of the Snu13p/15.5 kDa protein to the internal loop structural motif implies that the C/D box snoRNAs can form this structure in vivo. The Snu13p/15.5 kDa protein is the fourth shared C/D box snoRNA-binding protein to be identified. It is one of just two proteins shown to be required for snoRNA stability in vivo and is the only one so far shown to bind directly to the snoRNA. A second implication involves a proposed function for the Snu13p/15.5 kDa protein. The RNAs that bind Snu13p/15.5 kDa are involved in extensive base pairing with their substrate RNAs: U4 snRNA base pairs with U6 snRNA (Figure 1a), and the snoRNAs base pair with prerRNA (Figure 1d). In the splicing reaction, U4 snRNA delivers U6 snRNA to the spliceosome via the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP, then disassociates from U6 during the spliceosomal cycle. Nottrott et al. [3] proposed that, upon integration of the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP into the spliceosome, conformational rearrangements occur which are essential

for the first step of splicing to occur; these rearrangements require the association of Snu13p/15.5 kDa with U4. Many of the C/D box snoRNAs direct site-specific methylation of pre-rRNA by base pairing with the prerRNA at a site just 5 of the D box (Figure 1d). A few C/D box snoRNAs, U3 and U8 for example, do not modify prerRNA, but rather act as chaperones by base pairing with and modulating folding of rRNA. Even in these cases, however, the snoRNAs base pair only transiently with prerRNA and are not part of the mature ribosome. It is possible that Snu13p/15.5 kDa protein facilitates structural changes in the snoRNAs which assist the snoRNA in releasing rRNA and/or facilitate rRNA folding. Finally, the identification of an evolutionarily conserved protein that binds invariant nucleotides in very similar structures present in two distinct classes of RNPs raises interesting questions about the evolutionary origin of the RNPs. Watkins et al. [1] favor the notion that these RNPs may in fact share a common ancestor, but acknowledge that convergent evolution is also possible. They propose that U4 snRNA may have evolved from a primitive C/D box snoRNP. This is supported by the fact that Archaea have C/D box snoRNAs and the core C/D box proteins Nop1p/fibrillarin, Nop56p and Nop58p, but lack premRNA splicing components. Curiously, the apparent archaeal homologue of Snu13p/15.5 kDa protein is ribosomal protein L7a (also known as S6). The ancestral origins of Snu13p/15.5 kDa and the RNAs that it binds are clearly open to interpretation, and intriguing possibilities can be envisioned. But the new structural motif for the C/D box snoRNAs has already advanced our understanding of how the C/D core proteins bind the snoRNA. Future studies on the functional mechanisms of this RNA­protein interaction will no doubt be mutually informative for all RNPs involved.
