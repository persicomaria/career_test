Summary Complex biological networks are regulated via alterations in protein expression, degradation, and function. Synthetic control of these processes allows dissection of natural systems and the design of new networks. In E. coli, the adaptor SspB tethers ssrAtagged substrates to the ClpXP protease, causing a modest increase in their rate of degradation. To engineer controlled degradation, we have designed a series of modified ssrA tags that have weakened interactions with ClpXP. When SspB is present, ClpXP degrades purified substrates bearing these engineered peptide tags 100-fold more efficiently. Importantly, substrates bearing these tags are stable in the absence of SspB in vivo but are rapidly degraded upon SspB induction. Our studies supply a conceptual foundation and working components for controllable degradation, improve mechanistic understanding of adaptor-mediated proteolysis, and demonstrate that the relative importance of adaptor proteins in degradation is correlated with the strength of protease-substrate contacts. Introduction Biological circuits rely on the modulation of protein levels and function, often via changes in expression or degradation. Engineered control of these processes allows the construction of synthetic circuits and dissection of natural circuits. When decreased protein levels are required, transcription of a cloned gene can be turned off, but a long-lived protein will still persist for many generations. In bacteria, proteins can be targeted for proteolysis by adding a degradation tag to the coding sequence. However, there has been no convenient way to regulate this degradation. In Escherichia coli, the SspB adaptor protein enhances degradation of ssrA-tagged proteins by tethering them to the ClpXP protease (Figure 1A; Levchenko et al., 2000; Wah et al., 2003). ClpX binds substrate sequences known as degradation tags, unfolds the attached protein, and translocates the denatured polypeptide into ClpP for degradation (Sauer et al., 2004). Cloned proteins with C-terminal ssrA tags are degraded rapidly in the cell. Unfortunately, regulated control of degradation cannot be achieved just by manipulating SspB availability because ClpXP degrades ssrA-tagged substrates in SspB's absence. Moreover, other cellular proteases, including ClpAP, also degrade ssrA-tagged proteins (Gottesman et al.,

1998; Herman et al., 1998). Nevertheless, this system is well characterized, making it an attractive starting point for engineering studies. Distinct sequences in the ssrA tag are recognized by ClpX and SspB (Figure 1B; Flynn et al., 2001). The AANDENY portion of the tag binds SspB, and the LAA region interacts with ClpX, allowing direct handoff during substrate delivery (Figure 1A; Bolon et al., 2004). We reasoned that decreasing the strength of tag-ClpX interactions but retaining SspB binding should increase the ``adaptor-dependence'' of degradation. Indeed, substrates bearing designed tags meeting these criteria were degraded efficiently by ClpXP only when SspB was present, allowing intracellular degradation to be regulated by controlling SspB levels. Overall, this system provides a platform to mediate temporal control of the degradation of suitably tagged cytosolic proteins and establishes that adaptor-dependent degradation can be tuned in a modular fashion. Results Design and Optimization of SspB-Dependent ClpXP Degradation Tags We replaced two residues in the ssrA tag to weaken ClpX binding without diminishing SspB recognition (Figure 1B). Ser was chosen as an allowed but not preferred C-terminal residue; fewer than 10% of ClpXP substrates with ssrA-like degradation tags have Ser at this position (Flynn et al., 2003). Asp was chosen as the antepenultimate residue because this substitution decreases ClpXP and ClpAP degradation modestly (Flynn et al., 2001). We refer to ssrA tags with these mutations as DAS tags. The DAS tag (Figure 1B) was cloned at the C terminus of Arc repressor. Purified Arc-DAS was degraded poorly by ClpXP when SspB was absent but was degraded much faster with the adaptor (Figure 2A). By assaying degradation rates at different substrate/adaptor concentrations, the turnover number (Vmax/[ClpX6]) and substrate concentration required for half-maximal velocity (apparent KM) were determined (values shown in Figures 2B and 2C). Importantly, the rate of ClpXP degradation of 1 mM Arc-DAS in the presence of SspB was within 2-fold of that of Arc-ssrA in the absence of SspB (data not shown). However, KM for degradation of Arc-DAS increased more than 100-fold when SspB was absent. Thus, the DAS-tagged substrate depends on SspB for high-affinity binding and efficient degradation by ClpXP. Inserting residues between the ClpX and SspB binding sites in the ssrA tag allows better substrate delivery to ClpXP by SspB (Hersch et al., 2004). Three variant tags with insertions (DAS+2, DAS+4, and DAS+8; Figure 1B) were fused to Arc, and kinetic parameters for ClpXP degradation were measured with and without SspB (Figures 2B and 2C). With SspB, ClpXP degraded Arc-DAS+2 and Arc-DAS+4 roughly twice as fast as ArcDAS. The DAS+4-tagged substrate showed the highest differential degradation with versus without SspB (Figures 2D and 2E).

Figure 1. SspB Delivery of ssrA-Tagged Proteins to ClpXP (A) SspB binds ssrA-tagged substrates and ClpXP, forming a degradation delivery complex. (B) The ssrA tag interacts with SspB via Nterminal residues (green) and with ClpX via C-terminal residues (blue). Designed tags maintain the SspB binding region but have mutated ClpX-interacting residues (light blue, orange) and/or are extended by residues (red) between the SspB and ClpX binding regions.

Interactions between the extended DAS tags and ClpX were investigated. When the C-terminal tripeptide of Arc-DAS+2 was replaced with LDD (Figure 1B), no ClpXP degradation was detected with or without SspB (data not shown). Thus, the terminal DAS is required for degradation. Interactions between ClpX and the LAA of the wildtype ssrA tag stabilize SspB delivery complexes (Bolon et al., 2004). To determine if the DAS tripeptide also contributes to stability, we used SspB alone or crosslinked to LAA, DAS+4, LAA+4, or LDD+4 tags to compete for ClpX binding to a fluorescent variant of SspB disulfide bonded to an ssrA peptide (Hersch et al., 2005). SspBLAA+4 was the best competitor, followed by SspBLAA, SspB-DAS+4, SspB alone, and SspB-LDD+4 (Figure 2F). Although SspB-DAS+4 competed more poorly than SspB-LAA or SspB-LAA+4, it was a better competitor than SspB alone and SspB-LDD+4. Thus, the terminal DAS residues of the mutant tag must make some favorable ClpX contacts in SspB delivery complexes. Intracellular Degradation of DAS+4-Tagged Substrates DAS+4-tagged substrates require SspB for efficient ClpXP degradation in vitro. However, E. coli contains many other substrates, adaptors, and proteases. Thus, it was not clear whether SspB- and ClpXP-dependent degradation of DAS+4 substrates could be achieved in vivo. For these studies, the DAS+4 tag was fused to the I27 domain of titin and cloned in a plasmid under control of an isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible promoter. ClpXP degradation of ssrAtagged titin variants has been studied extensively in vitro (Kenniston et al., 2003).

Western blots showed very low levels of titin-DAS+4 in sspB+ clpX+ cells induced with IPTG (Figure 3A, lane 1), consistent with efficient intracellular degradation. These levels were substantially higher in sspB2 or clpX2 strains (Figure 3A, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that SspB and ClpX are required for efficient intracellular degradation of titin-DAS+4. To test whether titin-DAS+4 was degraded at any significant rate in the sspB2 strain, we induced titin-DAS+4 expression and added spectinomycin to stop protein synthesis or removed IPTG to halt transcription of titin-DAS+4. After both treatments, titinDAS+4 levels remained essentially unchanged (Figure 3B). Thus, little degradation occurs in the absence of SspB. These results show that proteases other than ClpXP do not degrade titin-DAS+4 to any appreciable degree, consistent with the fact that Arc-DAS+4 was degraded very poorly by ClpAP in vitro (data not shown). The Figure 3 experiments were performed in E. coli strain X90; titin-DAS+4 was also stable in strain MC4100 sspB2 and was degraded in an SspB-dependent fashion (data not shown). To regulate adaptor levels, a plasmid encoding SspB under arabinose-inducible promoter control was introduced into a DsspB strain with titin-DAS+4. For degradation studies, cells were grown to early log phase, IPTG was added, and growth continued for 40 min to allow titin-DAS+4 accumulation (Figure 3C). The culture was then divided equally, and SspB synthesis in one portion was induced with arabinose. Samples were taken from each subculture at different times, and titin-DAS+4 and SspB levels were assayed by Western blots. In the noarabinose culture, SspB levels were low, and titin-DAS+4 protein levels were high and increased throughout the

experiment (Figure 3D, left side). By contrast, SspB levels increased rapidly in the culture treated with arabinose, and titin-DAS+4 decreased to an undetectable level within 30 min (Figure 3D, right side). Thus, induction of SspB causes rapid intracellular depletion of titinDAS+4. Under the conditions of the experiment depicted in Figure 3D, cells doubled every 40­50 min. Quantitative Western blotting showed that z13,000 titin-DAS+4 molecules per cell were degraded upon SspB induction. Thus, SspB-mediated degradation of titin-DAS+4 reduced the concentration of an abundant protein to an undetectable level in less than one cell generation. SspB-dependent proteolysis of titin required a DAS tag. For example, titin-LDD+4 accumulated in the presence and absence of SspB (Figure 3E). As expected, titin-LAA+4 failed to accumulate even when SspB was absent (data not shown). Thus, the C-terminal residues of titin-DAS+4 are critical for SspB-dependent degradation in vivo. Gene Activation via Controlled Degradation To demonstrate SspB control of a genetic circuit, we monitored the activities of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) and b-galactosidase (lacZ) expressed from a promoter (PANT) repressible by DAS+4-tagged Arc. A prophage containing these genes was integrated into the genome of sspB2 cells (Figure 4A; Vershon et al., 1986). Arc-DAS+4 was cloned under IPTG-inducible promoter control on one plasmid; SspB under arabinose-

inducible promoter control was provided on another plasmid. When neither Arc-DAS+4 nor SspB was induced, cells grew on plates containing chloramphenicol (Figure 4B). However, repression of PANT resulted in no growth when Arc-DAS+4 expression was induced with IPTG. When expression of both Arc-DAS+4 and SspB was induced, cells regained the ability to grow on chloramphenicol, as expected if SspB-mediated degradation of Arc-DAS+4 caused derepression of PANT. Thus, antibiotic resistance can be regulated by adaptor-dependent degradation. In another experiment, a culture was grown to early log phase with continuous expression of Arc-DAS+4, split in half, and SspB was induced in one culture and b-gal activity assayed as a function of time. b-gal levels remained low in the absence of SspB induction, showing efficient repression of PANT by Arc-DAS+4 (Figure 4C). In contrast, b-gal expression increased when SspB was induced, indicating derepression of PANT (Figure 4C). Western blots confirmed that degradation of Arc-DAS+4 occurred concomitantly with derepression (Figure 4D). These experiments demonstrate that major phenotypic changes can be controlled by SspB-mediated degradation. Discussion Biological circuits control macromolecular levels and activities by intricate regulation of synthesis, degradation,

and function. Although many methods have been developed to regulate protein expression (Herring and Blattner [2004] and references therein), few tools exist to control degradation of specific proteins. With a few caveats, the system described here should allow degradation of virtually any suitably tagged cytoplasmic bacterial protein in response to controlled expression of the SspB adaptor. Problems could occur if addition of a DAS+4 tag compromised folding or activity of the target protein, if the appended tag was inaccessible, or if ClpXP degradation was too slow to clear the tagged protein. However, these problems should not occur for most proteins. First, C-terminal extensions can be added to the majority of yeast proteins with little perturbation to function (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003; Huh et al., 2003), and numerous examples show that bacterial proteins also tolerate C-terminal fusions. Second, the C termini of most proteins are solvent accessible, and we know of no ssrAtagged protein that is not degraded by ClpXP (n z 25). Third, ClpX is a robust unfoldase that denatures hyperstable substrates, including those assembled into complexes, for subsequent degradation (Kim et al., 2000; Burton et al., 2001a, 2001b; Lee et al., 2001; Kenniston et al., 2003). SspB-mediated degradation of Arc-DAS+4 in vivo resulted in induction of an Arc-repressible promoter. For titin-DAS+4, SspB induction resulted in ClpXP degradation of more than 10,000 tagged molecules in less than one cell generation. Moreover, endogenous levels of ClpXP are capable of degrading more than 100,000 copies of a tagged substrate per generation in E. coli (Farrell et al., 2005). Thus, our system should be adequate for degradation of all but the most abundant bacterial proteins and should be widely applicable for studies of protein function or the design of synthetic circuits.

Controllable eukaryotic degradation systems have been developed by employing tethering modules to link substrates to the proteasome or to enzymes that mediate polyubiquitin attachment (Janse et al., 2004; Zhou, 2005; Matsuzawa et al., 2005). However, these methods largely rely on attachment of a protein domain to the target protein or knowledge of an interacting partner. The system described here provides a modular and portable alternative for controllable protein degradation in prokaryotes requiring only three components (ClpX, ClpP, and SspB) and the tagged substrate. Use in eubacteria other than E. coli should be relatively straightforward employing endogenous ClpXP and SspB or importing E. coli ClpXP and/or SspB. This system should also be transportable to archaea or eukaryotes to provide an orthogonal method for controlled degradation. By contrast, it would be far more difficult to move the eukaryotic system into prokaryotes, as the proteasome contains more than 20 different proteins and many additional enzymes and components are required to allow addition of polyubiquitin to target proteins for degradation. Beyond the practical benefits, our results illuminate principles of SspB-mediated ClpXP proteolysis. Within the ssrA tag, recognition signals for SspB and ClpX are autonomous in the sense that they can be independently manipulated (Levchenko et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 2001; Hersch et al., 2004). This autonomy permitted use of the LAA/DAS mutations to weaken interactions between the tag and ClpX markedly without compromising SspB recognition. During adaptor-dependent substrate delivery, the LAA/DAS mutation modestly reduced both the affinity of ClpX for the SspB-substrate complex and the maximal rate of degradation. Thus, recognition by ClpX during SspB-mediated delivery is

Molecular Cell 706

not an all-or-none process but can be tuned by the identity of the C-terminal residues of the degradation tag. Our most important result, however, is that SspB delivery of optimized DAS-tagged substrates allows ClpXP degradation at a maximal rate only about 2-fold slower than ssrA-tagged substates. Hence, a protein that is a poor ClpXP substrate because it is present at a concentration well below its intrinsic KM can still be degraded very efficiently if SspB is present to facilitate binding to the protease. Thus, the combination of a weak proteasesubstrate interaction and a strong adaptor-substrate interaction can lead to degradation reactions that proceed at substantial rates only when the adaptor is present. This paradigm may be employed in several natural systems in which adaptor molecules regulate substrate degradation (Zhou et al., 2001; Pruteanu and HenggeAronis, 2002; Neher et al., 2003). By manipulating the ssrA tag and controlling SspB expression in E. coli, we designed a platform to mediate the ClpXP degradation of cytoplasmic proteins in a controlled manner. Implementation of this system will allow study and control of a number of both natural and synthetic biological systems. Straightforward modifications should allow the degradation of multiple substrates to be controlled independently and the eventual design of fully orthogonal degradation systems.
Experimental Procedures Plasmids and Strains Except for JK10 (BL21 clpP::cat, slyD::kan, lDE3; Kenniston et al., 2003), SG1146a (clpP::cat, Dlon, lDE3; S. Gottesman, NIH), and BLR (lDE3) (Novagen), all E. coli strains were derivatives of X90 (F0 lacIq lac0 pro0 /ara D(lac-pro) nalA argE(am) rif r thi-1). X90 sspB::kan was generated by P1 transduction from MC4100 sspB::kan (Levchenko et al., 2000). X90 F2 sspB::kan lAC201 was generated by transduction of the prophage lAC201, which contains cat and lacZ under the control of PANT, from UA2F (Vershon et al., 1986), followed by P1 transduction of sspB::kan into X90 F2 (C. Hayes, UC Santa Barbara). X90 clpX::kan (Farrell et al., 2005) and BB101 (X90 [lDE3] slyD::kan; Chivers and Sauer [1999]) have been described. Variants of Arc or the I27 domain of human titin with different Cterminal degradation tags were cloned by PCR amplification/mutagenesis of pET28b-Arc-ssrA (Burton et al., 2001b) or a plasmid encoding titin-I27-His6-ssrA (D. Bolon, MIT). For Arc variants, DNA fragments were ligated into pET21b (Novagen); final proteins included a glycine followed by wild-type residues 2­53, H6KNHQD, and a degradation tag (Figure 1B). For titin variants, DNA fragments were cloned into pTrc99A or pET21b; the final protein began with MHGLG-LIEVE (I27 residues in italic), contained the V13P mutation, and ended with KVKEL-GSGMDEH6RP and a degradation tag (Figure 1B). The A2C mutation in the tag employed for crosslinking was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. For studies in vivo, Arc-DAS+4 was amplified to restore the wild-type N-terminal sequence and ligated into pTrc99A. The final protein contained wild-type Arc residues 1­53, H6KNHQD, and the DAS+4 tag. SspBpCH410 was generated by ligating the SspB fragment of SspBpET21b (D. Bolon, MIT) into pCH410 (Hayes and Sauer, 2003) downstream of the pBAD promoter. SspB-SD1-pCH410 contained the Shine-Dalgarno sequence AGGCGG (mutation underlined), which was cloned into SspB-pCH410 from pSM68 (S. Moore, MIT). Protein Production For purification, proteins were expressed in strains BB101 (Arc and titin variants), JK10 (35S-Arc variants), SG1146a (Arc-ssrA), or BLR (lDE3) (SspB variants). 35S-Arc proteins were generated by growth in media containing [35S]-Met (Gottesman et al., 1998). ClpX, SspB, and titin variants were purified as described (Kim et al., 2000; Bolon et al., 2004; Kenniston et al., 2003). Arc variants were purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity. ClpP was a gift from R. Burton (MIT).

Covalent SspB-substrate complexes were assembled by disulfide crosslinking of titin substrates with an A2C mutation in the degradation tag to Y44C HE SspB, which contains the structured portion of H. influenza SspB (residues 1­106), the Y44C mutation, and the C-terminal 58 residues of E. coli SspB (Bolon et al., 2004). D. Bolon (MIT) provided the fluorescein-SspB-A2C-ssrA molecule used for competition (Bolon et al., 2004; Hersch et al., 2005). ClpXP Degradation In Vitro S-Arc variants were degraded at 30ºC using 100 nM ClpX6 and 300 nM ClpP14 in PD buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 200 mM KCl, 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.0128% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) with a regeneration system containing 4 mM ATP, 16 mM creatine phosphate, and 0.32 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase. When present, the concentration of SspB was equal to the substrate. Initial degradation rates were determined by the release of trichloroacetic-acid soluble peptides (Kim et al., 2000). Initial rates were plotted versus [substrate] and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation for reactions without SspB. Reactions with SspB were fitted to the following equation: rate = Vmax/(1+KASKASX/[0.5KAS(sqrt[1+4ST/ KAS] 2 1)]2), where ST is the total substrate concentration, KAS is the equilibrium constant for dissociation of the adaptorsubstrate complex (2.2 mM), and KASX is the equilibrium constant for dissociation of the adaptorsubstrateenzyme complex to adaptorsubstrate plus enzyme. This equation is valid when the adaptor and substrate concentrations are equal, the enzyme concentration is small relative to substrate, and degradation occurs only via adaptor delivery. Degradation of 5 mM unlabeled Arc-DAS with 300 nM ClpX6 and 900 nM ClpP14 (65 mM SspB) was performed as described above and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.

Competition for ClpX Binding Binding of fluorescein-SspB-ssrA (200 nM) to ClpX (200 nM) at 30ºC was assayed in PD buffer without NaCl plus 5 mM ATPgS with varying concentrations of SspB-substrate complexes as competitors. Fluorescence anisotropy values (excitation 477 nm; emission 515 nm) were measured using a QM-2000-4SE spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) for 2 min and averaged. Intracellular Degradation To monitor intracellular titin-DAS+4 levels, cultures of X90, X90 sspB::kan, or X90 clpX::kan transformed with titin-DAS+4-pTrc99A were grown to OD600 w0.4 in 25 mL LB broth plus ampicillin (100 mg/mL) and induced with IPTG (1 mM final concentration) for 40 min. Samples (1 mL) were removed, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 40 mL UL buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 8 M urea) plus 20 mL SDS buffer (234 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 300 mM dithiothreitol, 143 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.015% bromphenol blue, 0.06% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 30% glycerol), and frozen at 280ºC. Following lysis at 100ºC for 10 min, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Equal amounts of lysate (determined by OD600 of the original culture) were separated by SDS-PAGE. TitinDAS+4 protein was detected using His-probe H15-HRP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To monitor intracellular stability of titin-DAS+4 without SspB, X90 sspB::kan or MC4100 sspB::kan containing the expression plasmid was grown in LB broth plus ampicillin to OD600 w0.4 and induced with 1 mM IPTG. After 40 min, spectinomycin (100 mg/mL final concentration) was added, or the culture was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium without IPTG. Samples (1 mL) were taken at different times from each culture and harvested, lysed, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. To monitor SspB-dependent degradation of titin-DAS+4, X90 sspB::kan containing titin-DAS+4-pTrc99A and SspB-pCH410 was grown to OD600 w0.4 in 50 mL LB broth plus tetracycline (20 mg/mL) and ampicillin (100 mg/mL), titin-DAS+4 expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and growth was continued for 40 min to OD600 0.8­1. The culture was divided, and SspB expression was induced in one culture with 0.2% arabinose. Samples (1 mL) were taken from each culture at different times, processed, and analyzed as described above. One fifth of each sample was used to detect titinDAS+4 with the His-probe H15-HRP antibody; one fifteenth of each sample was used to detect SspB with an anti-SspB antibody. Comparable experiments were carried out to determine the intracellular

stabilities of titin-LAA+4 and titin-LDD+4. For quantitative Western blots, purified titin-DAS+4 with the A2C mutation in the degradation tag was used to generate a standard curve. Band intensities were quantified using a FluoroMax fluorimager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To monitor Arc-DAS+4 repression of PANT, X90 F2 sspB::kan lAC201 cells containing Arc-DAS+4-pTrc99A and SspB-SD1pCH410 were grown on LB agar with ampicillin (100 mg/mL), tetracycline (20 mg/mL), and chloramphenicol (100 mg/mL). IPTG (50 mg/mL) was spread on two-thirds of the plate and arabinose (0.2%) on onethird. For liquid culture experiments, cells were grown overnight in LB broth with ampicillin (100 mg/mL), tetracycline (20 mg/mL), and IPTG (50 mg/mL) at 25ºC to an OD600 of 0.2­0.7, then diluted into a 50­100 mL culture at an OD600 of 0.01­0.03. Cultures were grown at 37ºC to OD600 w0.4 and split in half, and SspB was induced in one half with arabinose (0.2%). Samples (1 mL) were taken from each culture at different times, OD600 measured, and three 20 mL samples taken and analyzed in a b-gal assay essentially as described (Zhang and Bremer, 1995). At the same time, samples (1 mL) were removed from each culture, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 40 mL UL buffer. Equal amounts of lysate, as determined by the OD600 of the original culture, were separated by SDS-PAGE. Arc-DAS+4 protein was detected using His-probe H15-HRP antibody. Acknowledgments We thank D.
