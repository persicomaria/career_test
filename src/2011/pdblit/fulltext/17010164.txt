DnaG is the primase that lays down RNA primers on single-stranded DNA during bacterial DNA replication. The solution structure of the DnaB-helicase-binding C-terminal domain of Escherichia coli DnaG was determined by NMR spectroscopy at near-neutral pH. The structure is a rare fold that, besides occurring in DnaG C-terminal domains, has been described only for the N-terminal domain of DnaB. The C-terminal helix hairpin present in the DnaG C-terminal domain, however, is either less stable or absent in DnaB, as evidenced by high mobility of the C-terminal 35 residues in a construct comprising residues 1­171. The present structure identifies the previous crystal structure of the E. coli DnaG C-terminal domain as a domain-swapped dimer. It is also significantly different from the NMR structure reported for the corresponding domain of DnaG from the thermophile Bacillus stearothermophilus. NMR experiments showed that the DnaG C-terminal domain does not bind to residues 1­171 of the E. coli DnaB helicase with significant affinity.

All organisms replicate DNA by copying one strand (the leading strand) in a continuous manner, whereas the other DNA strand (the lagging strand) is replicated in a discontinuous manner by the synthesis of short Okazaki fragments that are later joined into a continuous strand [1]. During DNA replication, a helicase separates the double-stranded DNA into single strands, and replication of the leading strand and synthesis of the Okazaki fragments is initiated by RNA primers made by the specialized RNA polymerase, primase. The first primase to be identified and characterized was that from Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the replicative helicase and primase are encoded by the dnaB and dnaG genes, respectively. The DnaB helicase forms a hexameric ring structure

with up to three molecules of the DnaG primase attached [2­4]. DnaG is composed of three main domains comprising an N-terminal zinc-binding domain for interaction with single-stranded DNA, a central domain responsible for primer synthesis, and a C-terminal domain (residues 434­581; DnaG-C) that binds to the DnaB helicase. The binding interaction with DnaB locates DnaG in the correct position to lay down primers on newly formed single-stranded DNA as the DnaB helicase progresses along the DNA. Primases are essential for DNA synthesis and are therefore targets for the development of new antibiotics [5]. No 3D structure has been determined for full-length DnaG, but crystal structures have been obtained for the N-terminal domain from Bacillus stearothermophilus

[6], the central RNA polymerase domain from E. coli [7,8], the two-domain fragment comprising both the N-terminal and RNA polymerase domains from Aquifex aeolicus [9], and the C-terminal helicase-binding domain from E. coli [4]. In addition, the structure of the C-terminal domain from B. stearothermophilus (P16) has been determined by NMR spectroscopy [10]. Despite their conserved function, the crystal structure of E. coli DnaG-C [4] and the subsequent solution structure of B. stearothermophilus P16 [10] show substantial differences, including a different number of helices with different helix boundaries and a different spatial arrangement of the C-terminal helices. These differences are important, because the C-terminal helix hairpin is critical for the binding of DnaG to DnaB [10,11]. In P16, the C-terminal helices are only loosely held in place by the rest of the structure [10]. In both structures, the N-terminal helices are packed in a fold similar to that of the N-terminal domain of DnaB (residues 24­136; DnaB-N) [12,13], and the DnaG-C crystal structure shows the C-terminal helices from different monomers entwined via intermolecular contacts in a way reminiscent of the fold of DnaB-N. The dimer structure was distorted by crystal contacts, resulting in noticeably different backbone conformations and different orientations of the C-terminal helices in each of the two monomers [4]. However, both gel filtration and analytic ultracentrifugation experiments at neutral pH showed that DnaG-C was monomeric [4], and it was difficult to ascribe any functional significance to the dimer. In addition, NMR spectroscopic analysis showed little evidence for dimer formation in solution. Some NOEs were observed that were consistent with the dimer interface observed in the crystal structure, and these were interpreted as evidence for a monomer­dimer equilibrium [4], but they could also arise from intramolecular contacts in solution that are not present in the monomers in the crystal structure. In order to resolve these difficulties and the discrepancies between the structure of P16 (which is monomeric in solution) and the different conformers in the crystal structure of DnaG-C, we here report the solution structure of E. coli DnaG-C determined under conditions where the protein is strictly monomeric. This new structure differs from the conformers observed in the single crystal, reveals a fold even closer to that of DnaB-N than the crystal conformers, and shows no evidence for the presence of two independent subdomains as in P16. The conformational rigidity of the monomeric DnaG-C structure was confirmed by 15N-relaxation, coupling constant and solvent accessibility measurements. The structure

identifies the crystal structure of DnaG-C as a domain-swapped dimer that probably has no functional significance. The close fold conservation between DnaG-C and DnaB-N prompted us also to investigate a longer N-terminal construct of DnaB, DnaB(1­171), for the presence of a C-terminal helix hairpin as present in DnaG-C. DnaB(1­171) comprises the complete N-terminal domain and hinge regions of DnaB identified by proteolysis [14], and includes peptide segments that have previously been shown by mutation analyses to modulate the interaction between DnaG and DnaB [3,11,15,16]. Consequently, we also probed the interaction between DnaG-C and DnaB(1­171).

Results
Aggregation state of DnaG-C DnaG-C is prone to self-aggregation at high protein concentration and in the absence of salt [17]. Ultracentrifugation experiments at 0.06 and 0.29 mm protein concentration in the presence of 100 mm NaCl yielded Mr values of 16 500 and 14 100, respectively, indicating that the single species present was the monomer (calculated Mr ¼ 16 701; supplementary Fig. S1). To verify the monomeric state of the protein under the conditions used for NMR structure determination (0.4 mm DnaG-C, pH 6.1, 100 mm NaCl, 25 °C), the rotational correlation time of DnaG-C was determined from the ratio of transverse and longitudinal 15N relaxation rates. The rotational correlation time sm was found to be 11 ± 1 ns, based on average values of R1 ¼ 0.99 ± 0.13 s)1 and R2 ¼ 20.41 ± 1.68 s)1 for the structurally well-defined part of the protein (Fig. 1). Increased R1 and decreased R2 relaxation rates indicated increased mobility and structural disorder for about 12 and three residues at the N-terminus and C-terminus of the construct, respectively, in agreement with the narrow 1H-NMR line widths reported earlier for these residues [17]. Negative [1H]15N NOEs were observed for residues 437­441 at the N-terminus, demonstrating mobility on the subnanosecond timescale, whereas the NOE was greater than 0.7 for residues 453­578, indicating structural rigidity for this part of the protein (data not shown). The rotational correlation time of rigid protein structures can be predicted from the atomic coordinates using hydronmr [18]. The rotational correlation times predicted for the individual monomers and the dimer in the crystal structure of DnaG-C [4] were about 17 and 36 ns, respectively, and thus much longer

than the value of 11 ns derived from the 15N-relaxation times in solution. However, rotational correlation times of, respectively, 11 and 12 ns were predicted for the corresponding domain from B. stearothermophilus [10] and for the monomeric DnaG-C structure reported here. These data and the uniformity of the relaxation rates along the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1) supported the notion of DnaG-C being a monomeric, structurally compact domain with no evidence for segmentation into subdomains as observed in the crystal structure [4] and reported for P16 [10]. Structure determination The solution structure of E. coli DnaG-C was determined using NOEs and backbone dihedral angle restraints derived from chemical shifts. All NOEs were interpreted as intramolecular NOEs. The resulting monomeric structure fulfilled all assigned NOEs without significant residual violations (Table 1). The fold exposes all charged amino acid side chains to the solvent and buries all hydrophobic side chains that are highly conserved among different bacterial species (Fig. 2). The side chain solvent accessibility averaged over the different NMR conformers is 16% or less for any of the conserved hydrophobic side chains, except for the side chain of Leu484, which is almost 30% solvent exposed. The conservation of Leu484 may be explained by its contacts with Leu519, which is a

structure of DnaG-C as a domain-swapped dimer, where helix 6 from one protein molecule binds to the core of the other in a manner similar to that in which helix 6 binds to the core of the structure in the monomeric solution structure (Figs 3A and 4). The two conformers in the crystal structure vary not only with regard to helix 6 (Fig. 3D,E) but also in the part comprising helices 1­5, with a backbone rmsd of ° 2.0 A for residues 449­525. The differences are mostly due to a displacement of helix 5 and variability in the loop region between helices 2 and 3. The backbone rmsd for the same residues with respect to the solution ° structure is 1.8 ± 0.1 and 2.4 ± 0.1 A for crystal conformers I and II, respectively. The largest differences are in the loop region between helices 2 and 3, suggesting that this region is flexible. Whereas 15N-HSQC spectra of DnaG-C at pH 4.6, 6.1 and 8.1 displayed virtually the same chemical shifts, some of the cross-peaks in the spectrum recorded at pH 4.6 (the pH used for crystallization) were exceedingly weak, especially in the loop regions

between helices 2 and 7 (supplementary Figs S2 and S3). This indicates the presence of chemical exchange phenomena at low pH in the millisecond time regime. Increased mobility of the loop regions at pH 4.6 and 8.1 was also suggested by the observation of enhanced 15 N-relaxation rates (supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, the domain swap observed in the crystal structure may have been due to the use of a pH value below the isoelectric point of the protein (5.0). As comparable NMR line widths and 15N-relaxation rates were observed for the regular secondary structure elements at all three pH values, the domain-swapped dimer is not the major conformational species even at low pH. Comparison with P16 from B. stearothermophilus Except for the C-terminal helices, the solution structure of P16, the DnaG-C domain from B. stearothermophilus [10], shows the same overall fold as the present solution structure of E. coli DnaG-C (Fig. 3A,C). However, the similarity is less striking

Solution structure of E. coli DnaG-C

The structural differences between P16 and E. coli DnaG-C may be explained by the low sequence homology between the two proteins. Although P16 features 14 of the 16 hydrophobic side chains found with high conservation among DnaG-Cs from different bacterial species, the structure-based sequence alignment of Fig. 2 resulted in only 13% sequence identity between P16 and E. coli DnaG-C. The low sequence homology also explains why our structure-based sequence alignment is very different from the sequence alignment reported earlier [10]. The flexibility of the linker peptide connecting helices 6 and 7 in P16 (Fig. 3C) and the different breaking points in helix 6 of E. coli DnaG-C observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 3D,E) raise questions about the flexibility of helix 6 of E. coli DnaG-C in solution. Structure verification of helix 6 of DnaG-C An extensive set of Ha(i)-HN(i+3) NOEs, 3JHNHa coupling constants smaller than 6 Hz, and chemical shifts (15N, 13Ca, 13Cb, 1Ha and 13C¢) indicative of helical secondary structure along the length of helix 6, all suggest that a straight helix as depicted in Fig. 3A is a faithful representation of this helix in DnaG-C under the conditions of the NMR experiments. Measurements of the 3JHNHa coupling constants at 20 lm rather than 0.4 mm protein concentration (data not shown) did not yield significantly increased coupling constants, showing that the structure of helix 6 is not stabilized by concentration-dependent self-association. Although the NMR structure of DnaG-C should be a reliable representation of the average structure in solution, this does not exclude the possibility of small populations of conformers with spontaneously formed transient breaks in helix 6 as a possible prelude to the formation of a domain-swapped dimer. We carefully analyzed the NOESY spectra of DnaG-C with regard to this question. As NOEs strongly emphasize the presence of short internuclear distances, NOE spectra can convey the signature of minor conformational species if short internuclear distances occur in a minor, but not in the major, conformation. However, the 3D 15 N-NOESY-HSQC spectrum of DnaG-C recorded at 0.4 mm protein concentration on a 800 MHz NMR spectrometer showed no significantly different NOE patterns compared to the corresponding spectrum recorded previously on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with a 0.6 mm sample in the same NMR buffer [4]. In particular, strong sequential HN­HN NOEs and weak sequential Ha­HN NOEs characteristic of helical secondary structure were found all along helix 6. Furthermore, no evidence for a minor population of the

domain-swapped dimer could be found, as all NOEs previously thought to be indicative of the domainswapped dimer [4] were in agreement with the present monomeric structure and independent of protein concentration between 0.2 and 0.4 mm. The flexibility of helix 6 was further investigated by measurements of the solvent accessibility of amide protons as evidenced by enhanced 1H-NMR line widths observed in the presence of a soluble paramagnetic relaxation agent. Breaks in this helix would be expected to interrupt the hydrogen bonding pattern and expose some of the amide protons to the solvent. We used Gd[diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-bismethylamide (DTPA-BMA)] as an uncharged relaxation enhancement agent that does not change the chemical shifts of the protein signals [20]. In addition, we used a low protein concentration (40 lm) to minimize the chance of any self-association. Comparison of the peak heights measured in 15N-HSQC spectra recorded with and without Gd(DTPA-BMA) revealed pronounced solvent exposure only for loop regions between helices and for the flexible N-terminal residues (Fig. 5). In contrast, the amide protons of helix 6 were among the protected protons. In view of the uncertainty ranges associated with the data points, the slightly enhanced relaxation rates observed for the amide protons of residues 541, 543, and 548 barely indicates significant temporary solvent exposure in a conformational equilibrium. Structure investigation of DnaB(1­171) The striking structural homology between DnaG-C and DnaB-N (Fig. 3A,B) invites the question of whether a longer construct of DnaB-N could display a C-terminal helix hairpin like DnaG-C, considering that it is a feature of all DnaG-C conformers reported to date. Secondary structure prediction of DnaB suggests a helix for residues 153­169 and an extension of helix 6 by 11 amino acids to residue 145. As our original DnaB-N construct was truncated at Glu161, this could have caused the random coil behavior reported from residue 137 onwards [21]. A TOCSY spectrum recorded of DnaB(1­171), however, displayed the same cross-peaks as the TOCSY spectrum reported previously of DnaB(1­161) [21] with additional cross-peaks for the 10 additional C-terminal residues (data not shown). Owing to the increased Mr effected by dimerization of the DnaB-N domain [12], the TOCSY spectrum recorded with a long mixing time (80 ms) strongly emphasizes the signals from the mobile residues with narrow line widths. In the TOCSY spectrum of DnaB(1­171), narrow line widths and

random coil chemical shifts were observed for the entire polypeptide segment from residues 137 to 171. Therefore, the C-terminal helix hairpin observed in DnaG-C is not a structural feature of DnaB(1­171). Interaction of DnaG-C with DnaB(1­171) Binding of DnaG-C to DnaB(1­171) was probed by comparing the 15N-HSQC spectra of 0.13 mm 15N / 13 C-labeled DnaG-C in the absence and presence of an equal amount of unlabeled DnaB(1­171). No chemical shift changes or changes in peak intensities were detected. This indicates that any binding between these two domains would be characterized by a dissociation constant of at least 0.5 mm. A dissociation constant of 4.9 lm has been reported for the complex between DnaG-C and full-length DnaB from BIAcore studies [4]. In agreement with the NMR results, no inhibitory interaction between DnaB(1­171) and full-length DnaG could be observed in a BIAcore assay, where a 5 lm solution of DnaB(1­171) was mixed with 285 nm DnaG prior to its injection over a surface displaying single-stranded DNA-bound DnaB hexamer, under conditions used in our earlier studies [4] (data not shown). Furthermore, there was no sign of toxicity of DnaB(1­171) when overexpressed in E. coli, as might have been expected if tight binding of DnaB(1­171) to

DnaG were to compete with its interaction with the DnaB hexamer.

Discussion
The present structure determination of DnaG-C revealed a fold very similar to that of the N-terminal domain of the E. coli DnaB helicase (DnaB-N) [12,13]. The similarity includes helix 6, which is differently oriented in the conformers of the domain-swapped dimer (Fig. 3). The structural similarity between DnaG-C and DnaB-N is intriguing, as no other protein is known with this particular fold, and DnaG binds to DnaB. In view of the critical importance of the C-terminal helix hairpin of DnaG-C for the interaction with DnaB [4,10], it is tempting to speculate that the domain-swapped dimer observed in the crystal structure of E. coli DnaG-C might serve as a model for the interaction with DnaB-N. Many attempts have been made to pinpoint the interaction between DnaG and DnaB to protein subdomains. Whereas the interaction seems to be entirely confined to the C-terminal domain of DnaG [4,10], the situation is much less clear for DnaB. For example, mutations in the N-terminal domain of E. coli DnaB have been shown to interfere with the DnaB­DnaG interaction [22], but corresponding mutations in B. stearothermophilus had much smaller if any effects [3,16].

Solution structure of E. coli DnaG-C

Apparently inconsistent results could arise from the fact that E. coli DnaB-N is only marginally stable against unfolding [23,24] and easily destabilized by mutations. In B. stearothermophilus, DnaG was found to protect the linker residues between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of DnaB from digestion with trypsin and pepsin [25]. Mutations of linker residues (I135N, I141T, L156P) also affected the interaction of Salmonella typhimurium DnaB and DnaG [15]. In E. coli, the interaction depends in addition on residues of the C-terminal domain between Tyr210 and Val255 of DnaB [26]. Mutation analysis of linker residues and of residues in the C-terminal domain of B. stearothermophilus DnaB confirmed the importance of residues in these parts of the protein [3,16]. Unlike in the wildtype protein, the individual N-terminal and C-terminal domains of B. stearothermophilus DnaB do not form a complex with DnaG that is sufficiently stable for isolation by gel filtration [25]. The emerging picture is one of an extensive interaction interface between DnaB and DnaG-C involving the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of DnaB as well as the connecting linker [3,16]. Interactions characterized by exceedingly weak binding affinities can be probed sensitively by NMR spectroscopy. However, attempts to observe an interaction between E. coli DnaG-C and a shorter DnaB-N fragment containing the N-terminal 161 residues by NMR spectroscopy were unsuccessful [4]. Our new fragment DnaB(1­171), which includes many of the linker residues, equally showed no binding with DnaG-C or DnaG, illustrating the critical importance of the C-terminal domain of DnaB for this interaction. Possibly, the linker between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of DnaB also assumes a different secondary structure in the full-length protein, considering that we found the C-terminal 35 residues of DnaB(1­171) to be disordered, although secondary structure predictions show high helix propensity for more than half of them. The present structure of monomeric E. coli DnaG-C identifies the earlier crystal structure of the same protein as a domain-swapped dimer, in which helix 5 of one monomer binds to the core of helices formed by helices 1­4 of the other, in a very similar manner as in the monomeric solution structure. The present data suggest that the domain-swapped dimer occurs only at a pH value below the isoelectric point of the protein and plays no role under physiologic conditions. As the present solution structure of DnaG-C accommodates all the NOEs discussed previously [4] in a monomeric structure, there remains no evidence for intermolecular interactions across a dimer interface, and no conformational exchange phenomena need to be invoked to

explain differences between the NMR data and the crystal structure [4]. The sensitivity of the DnaG-C structure with respect to pH is reflected in much decreased peak intensities for loop residues observed in 15N-HSQC spectra at pH 4.6 versus those recorded at pH 6.1 or 8.1, and in increased 15N-relaxation rates for amides in loop regions. These exchange phenomena indicate the presence of alternative conformations, especially at low pH. Considering that carboxylate side chains remain mostly deprotonated at pH 4.6, the low-pH form of the DnaG-C structure may be triggered by protonation of histidine side chains. Of the two histidine residues in DnaG-C, His541 is located in helix 6. In the solution structure, His541 is close to Lys447 and Lys448, which are located near the N-terminus of the domain, whereas these residues are much farther from His541 in the domain-swapped dimer (Fig. 4A,B). Electrostatic repulsion could thus drive the separation of helix 6 from the core of the structure. Weak and missing 15 N-HSQC cross-peaks observed for His541 and nearby residues, including residues 445­450, suggest that histidine protonation contributes to the exchange phenomena at pH 4.6 (supplementary Fig. S3). Comparison of the solvent-accessible surface of hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the monomer and the dimer shows only few significant differences, with the most notable difference involving the side chain of Ile530, which is highly solvent exposed in the monomer (Fig. 4B) but buried in the dimer interface. Neither His541 nor Ile530 are conserved in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 2), suggesting that the phenomenon of domain-swapping at low pH may be limited to DnaG-C from E. coli. Considering, in addition, the apparent absence of any interaction between DnaG-C and DnaB(1­171), the domain-swapped dimer of DnaG-C is unlikely to be a model of the DnaG­DnaB interaction. The equivalent DnaG-C domain from B. stearothermophilus (P16) [10] is a monomer in solution, but helix 6 in this structure is broken into two (Fig. 3C). A flexible helix linkage is supported by the presence of Pro556 in P16, which may act as a helix breaker. The corresponding residue in E. coli DnaG-C is Met542, i.e. a residue with high helix propensity. None of the other DnaG-C domains shown in the sequence alignment of Fig. 2 features a proline residue at this position, suggesting that a break in helix 6 is not a general feature of DnaGs from different organisms. Therefore, although the present solution structure of E. coli DnaG-C is representative of DnaG-C domains from a large number of bacteria, significant structural variability seems to have evolved in less closely related species,

where the sequence divergence is sufficiently large to render amino acid sequence alignments unreliable [10]. This observation highlights the fact that structures determined for thermophilic or Gram-positive bacteria are not necessarily faithful representations of their homologs in E. coli, the bacterium for which most biochemical knowledge has been accumulated.

Experimental procedures
Sample preparation
Unlabeled and uniformly 13C / 15N-labeled DnaG-C containing residues 434­581 was overproduced and purified as previously described [17]. All samples for NMR measurements were prepared in a buffer containing 90% H2O / 10% D2O, 10 mm phosphate (pH 6.1), 100 mm NaCl and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration was 0.4 mm except where indicated otherwise. The DnaB(1­171) deletion mutant was amplified by PCR from plasmid pPS562 containing the dnaB gene [27]. An NdeI site was present at the ATG start codon, and a TAA stop codon followed by an EcoRI site was inserted immediately after codon 171. The amplified fragment was digested and inserted between corresponding restriction sites in the phage T7 promoter-based vector pETMCSI [28] and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)recA [23] for protein expression. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed using an ABI 3730 sequencer (Biomolecular Resource Facility, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia), following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). DnaB(1­171) was produced and the cells were lysed using a procedure established for other DnaB-N domains [21]. After cell lysis, the protein was purified as described [12], except that the Sephadex G50 column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm NaCl. Peak fractions containing DnaB(1­171) were pooled (20 mL), diluted with an equal volume of MonoQ buffer (50 mm Tris / HCl at pH 7.6 and 5 mm MgCl2), and loaded directly onto a MonoQ (HR 5 / 5) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in MonoQ buffer. A linear gradient of NaCl in MonoQ buffer was applied (3.75 mmÆmin)1, at a flow rate of 0.5 mLÆmin)1). DnaB(1­171) eluted as a sharp peak between 52 and 58 min. The protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed in NMR buffer. ESI MS confirmed the identity of the protein and the absence of an N-terminal methionine (observed molecular mass, 18 919; calculated molecular mass 18 920).

analytical ultracentrifuge XLI with An-60 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The samples were prepared by dialysis against a buffer similar to that used for NMR studies, containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.1), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w / v) sodium azide at two different concentrations (1.02 and 4.86 mgÆmL)1). The sedimentation equilibrium profile was recorded in triplicate at two different wavelengths (280 and 300 nm) after 18 h at 20 000 r.p.m. and 25 °C. Plots of ln A versus r2 were linear (supplementary Fig. S1), indicating the absence of an equilibrium mixture of species at both concentrations. The average Mr was calculated by linear regression using ultrascan data analysis software Version 5 (Beckman Coulter), and an (assumed) partial specific volume of 0.72 mLÆg)1.

NMR measurements
NMR measurements of unlabeled DnaB(1­171) were carried out in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris / HCl (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Free DnaB(1­171) was measured at a concentration of 0.22 mm. The interaction with DnaG-C was probed using the same buffer with each protein at 0.13 mm. All NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) AV 800 NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. The previously reported backbone resonance assignments of DnaG-C [4] were verified and supplemented with side chain resonance assignments using 3D CC(CO)NH, HNHA (H)CCH-TOCSY, NOESY-15N-HSQC (60 ms mixing time), 13C-HSQCNOESY (40 ms mixing time), and 2D NOESY (40 ms mixing time), DQF-COSY, and TOCSY spectra. 3 JHNHa coupling constants were measured at protein concentrations of 20 and 400 lm, in a CT-HMQC-HN experiment [29]. The solvent exposure of protein backbone amides was probed by the decrease in peak intensities observed in 15N-HSQC spectra caused by 6 mm Gd(DTPABMA) [20]. The experiment was carried out at protein concentrations of 20 and 40 lm. 15 N-relaxation parameters (R2, R1, and [1H]15N-NOE) were measured [30], using relaxation delays of 3, 30, 80, 150, 250, 400, 600, 850 and 1200 ms in the R1 experiment, and relaxation delays of 8.8, 17.6, 26.4, 35.2, 44.0, 52.8, 61.6, 70.4, 79.2 and 88.0 ms in the R2 experiment. The rotational correlation time sm was estimated from the R2 / R1 ratio [31]. A TOCSY spectrum of DnaB(1­171) was recorded under the same conditions, using a mixing time of 80 ms.

The molecular weights of DnaG-C samples were determined by equilibrium sedimentation using a Beckman

of these restraints were collected from the 2D NOESY spectrum (40 ms mixing time) of unlabeled DnaG-C in 22 h, using t1max ¼ 78 ms and t2max ¼ 213 ms. Dihedral angle restraints were generated using the program talos [32] and checked by comparison with the measured 3JHNHa coupling constants and intensities of intraresidual and sequential NOEs between backbone protons. Stereospecific resonance assignments and v1 angle restraints were obtained by repeated structure calculations and evaluations using the programs cyana and glomsa, respectively [33].

Structure calculations
The NOESY cross-peaks were assigned and integrated using the program xeasy / cara [34,35]. The NMR structure was calculated using the program cyana [33], starting from 200 random conformers that were annealed in 40 000 steps using torsion-angle dynamics. The 20 conformers with the lowest residual restraint violations were energy minimized in a shell of water using the program opal with standard parameters [36]. The Ramachandran plot was analyzed using procheck-nmr [37]. Secondary structure elements and rmsd values were calculated using the program molmol [38]. Side chain solvent accessibilities were measured with a spherical probe of ° 1.4 A radius and calculated as percentage of the accessibilities measured for a fully extended side chain of residue X in a helical Gly-X-Gly peptide [39]. The values obtained were averaged over the 20 NMR conformers. The rotational correlation time was predicted from atomic coordinates using the program hydronmr with the ° atomic element radius set to 3.3 A [18]. The program molmol [38] was used to prepare Figs 3 and 4.
