Themes in RNA-Protein Recognition
David E. Draper
Department of Chemistry Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 21218, USA Atomic resolution structures are now available for more than 20 complexes of proteins with speci®c RNAs. This review examines two main themes that appear in this set of structures. A ``groove binder'' class of proteins places a protein structure (a-helix, 310-helix, b-ribbon, or irregular loop) in the groove of an RNA helix, recognizing both the speci®c sequence of bases and the shape or dimensions of the groove, which are sometimes distorted from the normal A-form. A second class of proteins uses b-sheet surfaces to create pockets that examine single-stranded RNA bases. Some of these proteins recognize completely unstructured RNA, and in others RNA secondary structure indirectly promotes binding by constraining bases in an appropriate orientation. Thermodynamic studies have shown that binding speci®city is generally a function of several factors, including base-speci®c hydrogen bonds, non-polar contacts, and mutual accommodation of the protein and RNA-binding surfaces. The recognition strategies and structural frameworks used by RNA binding proteins are not exotically different from those employed by DNA-binding proteins, suggesting that the two kinds of nucleic acid-binding proteins have not evolved independently.

Introduction
How proteins selectively bind speci®c sites on nucleic acids has been a challenging and interesting problem since the earliest days of molecular biology. The repressor hypothesis (Jacob & Monod, 1961) led to the demonstration that a protein is able to select a single DNA sequence out of an entire genome (Ptashne, 1967). This impressive feat of molecular recognition has been intensively studied ever since, and there are now a large number of atomic resolution structures of protein-DNA complexes which, with parallel thermodynamic studies, provide a picture of how sequence-speci®c DNA recognition is performed by a variety of repressors, transcription factors, and restriction enzymes. But perhaps the ®rst protein-nucleic acid recognition problem to be de®ned was the enzymatic linking of an amino acid with its correct

tRNA (Berg & Ofengand, 1958; Hoagland, 1960), a process whose speci®city was seen as crucial for accurate gene expression. Protein recognition of speci®c RNA sites was also implicit in early studies of ribosome assembly (Traub & Nomura, 1969; Nomura, 1973). Since then, the participation of speci®c protein-RNA complexes in a large number of cellular processes has become evident. For a variety of reasons, biochemical and physical characterization of protein-RNA complexes has lagged behind corresponding studies of proteinDNA complexes by more than a decade. In a comprehensive review of RNA-protein interactions written in 1994 (Draper, 1995), structures were available for three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetasetRNA complexes and two complexes of proteins with RNA hairpins (MS2 coat protein and the U1A RNA binding domain). Since then, more than a dozen new peptide and protein-RNA complexes have been solved by NMR or crystallography, and many of these have been accompanied by binding studies with sequence variants. The present review is an update of the 1995 review in light of the new structural and thermodynamic information that has become available. The emphasis will be on two main categories that encompass most of the

256 structures: peptides and proteins that bind RNA helix grooves, and b-sheet proteins that recognize single-stranded bases in a sequence-speci®c manner. The two themes underscore the range of recognition strategies available to RNA-binding proteins, from purely sequence-dependent discrimination among single-stranded RNAs to recognition of highly structured RNA surfaces. Peptides and proteins binding in RNA grooves The A-form geometry of RNA helices has a deep and narrow major groove, which is not accessible to protein secondary structure in the same way as B-form DNA. However, there are two mitigating factors. First, RNA secondary structures rarely contain a more than half a turn of helix, and so have much of their major groove surface accessible from the ends. Second, mismatches and bulges confer a surprising plasticity on RNA helices and generate major grooves wide enough for protein secondary structure to penetrate. The wide and ¯at minor groove surface is, of course, easily accessible to protein. The structures of six different proteinRNA complexes feature a peptide or portion of a protein bound in the groove of an RNA helix, and are discussed here. Arginine-rich sequences Three groove-binding peptides belong to an arginine-rich class of protein sequences. (The term ``arginine-rich motif'' is still in use for these peptides, though their very different structures and lack of conserved arginine positions should disqualify them from being called a motif.) Despite the extensive use of arginine in each case, these peptides provide a broad picture of the strategies available to a protein recognizing the RNA major groove. The Rev peptide adopts an a-helical conformation upon binding to an RNA hairpin (Tan et al., 1993). Binding studies with a systematic series of alanine substitutions identi®ed positions critical for RNA recognition (Tan et al., 1993), and a second series of Arg 3 Lys variants identi®ed positions where only positive charge was important for binding (Tan & Frankel, 1994). In the RNA, selection experiments had identi®ed bases whose identity are important for recognition, including an unusual purine-purine mismatch (Bartel et al., 1991). The structure of the complex was subsequently solved by NMR methods (Battiste et al., 1996). Two purine-purine mismatches and a bulged base (U72) create an unusual S-shaped backbone in which G71 ¯ips over and becomes parallel with G48, with which it pairs (Figure 1(a)). The net effect is a substantial widening of the major groove to accommodate the a-helix. The NMR structure of a complex between the same peptide and an RNA hairpin selected to have high binding af®nity shows similar features (Ye et al., 1996). In that RNA, an A ÁA pair isosterically

RNA-Protein Recognition

substitutes for the G48 ÁG71 pair, and a two base bulge places a U in position to make a Hoogsteen pair with an A at the equivalent position of C69. The extra U is sandwiched between Arg35 and Arg38; the additional non-polar contacts may account for its selection. Schematics of protein-RNA contacts within the Rev-RRE complex are shown in Figure 1(a), and reveal a simple pattern of electrostatic, hydrogen bond, and non-polar contacts. The left-hand panel shows the appearance of amino acid side-chains on the surface of the a-helix. Strips of ®ve arginine residues (upper left in Figure 1(a)) on one side of the helix and two arginine residues on the other side probably interact electrostatically with the RNA, on the basis that substitution with an alanine but not lysine residue is deleterious (Tan & Frankel, 1994). Four of these closely approach non-bridging phosÊ phate oxygen atoms (<4 A), but the remainder are not clearly associated with a speci®c phosphate (6Ê 7 A distance to nearest backbone charge). These are presumably sensing the electrostatic ®eld of the RNA. Conversely, substitution of alanine for arginine residues at positions 41, 42, or 43 has negligible effect on RNA binding af®nity (Tan et al., 1993), even though each of these arginine residues closely approaches a phosphate oxygen atom (N Ð O disÊ tances of 3-4 A). Some of the arginine side-chains may be poorly determined or disordered in the NMR experiments, contributing to uncertainties in their positions relative to the phosphate groups; other potential problems with interpreting the binding af®nities of mutants in terms of electrostatic contributions are discussed below. A group of four residues (three Arg and one Asn) lie between the two sets of electrostatically interacting amino acids and hydrogen bond to bases. A little more than two turns of a-helix spans the equivalent of seven base-pairs. This is a more extensive set of base-speci®c contacts than most DNA-binding proteins, which typically span three or four base-pairs with one subunit. Aliphatic carbon atoms from an arginine and an alanine residue make non-polar contacts with endo faces of backbone riboses, and a single tryptophan residue stacks against a bulged adenine base. All of the amino acid side-chains that hydrogen bond to bases, as well as Thr34 that hydrogen bonds to a phosphate, gave ten to 40-fold reductions in binding af®nity when mutated to alanine (Tan et al., 1993). Mutation of Arg43 or Trp45 did not affect RNA binding detectably, despite the non-polar contacts made by these residues. The themes of base-speci®c hydrogen bonds and non-polar contacts with sugars are repeated in other groovebinding peptides. The N protein of phage l prevents transcription termination of some phage operons. The N-terminal peptide of the protein is disordered, but folds into an a-helix upon binding the box B RNA hairpin (Tan & Frankel, 1995; Van Gilst et al., 1997). An NMR-based structure of the complex shows that the peptide a-helix binds a GNRA-like tetraloop,

257 peptide to bind as an irregular b-hairpin. Both bstrands contact the RNA helix (Figure 1(c)). Basespeci®c hydrogen bonds are made from three arginine side-chains and two backbone positions. An isoleucine is packed against the U10 base triplet; this interaction is important to the formation of the complex but can be substituted by several other hydrophobic residues with only four to ®vefold reduction in binding af®nity (Chen & Frankel, 1995). Even U10 can be substituted by C or A with only twofold loss of af®nity (Chen & Frankel, 1994). None of the three glycine residues can be mutated to alanine without substantial loss of binding activity: the a-carbon atoms of Gly71 and Gly74 are close to the A21 ribose and U21 base, respectively, where introduction of a b-carbon would cause steric clash, and Gly76 is important for the hairpin turn. There is an interesting parallel between the BIV Tat-TAR complex and met repressor recognition of DNA (Somers & Phillips, 1992). The repressor binds DNA as a dimer, placing a two-stranded antiparallel b-ribbon in the major groove and using lysine and threonine residues from each strand to make base-speci®c contacts. Other parts of the protein make additional contacts with the DNA backbone. Thus both a DNA and an RNA binding protein use a b-ribbon to recognize a speci®c sequence from the nucleic acid major groove (see Figure 2). Recognition of RNA helix grooves by proteins The C-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L11 folds into three a-helices that are superimposable with a-helices of the homeodomain class of DNAbinding proteins (Xing et al., 1997). The surface of a-helix 3 contacts RNA, just as homeodomain helix 3 lies in the major groove of DNA (Hinck et al., 1997; Conn et al., 1999). However, contacts are made with an RNA minor groove that has been distorted to present a relatively ¯at surface, in contrast to the major groove nucleic acid binding surfaces of homeodomains and the arginine-rich peptides discussed above. L11 is the only example of minor groove recognition among the RNAprotein complexes whose structures have been deduced by NMR or crystallography, though minor groove recognition of an acceptor stem GÁU wobble pair has been demonstrated for alanyltRNA synthetase (Musier-Forsyth et al., 1991; Musier-Forsyth & Schimmel, 1992). A schematic of the recognized RNA helix surface is shown in Figure 1(d). Distortions of the RNA helix are maintained by tertiary interactions with other parts of the RNA domain. The most unusual of these is the formation of a Hoogsteen base-pair between U1060 and A1088, which intercalates into the helix major groove from a bulge loop elsewhere in the molecule. The entire U1060 nucleotide is ¯ipped over so that the uridine base presents its major groove edge in the minor groove surface of the helix;

and from there accesses the major groove of the adjoining helix (Legault et al., 1998). The a-helix extends about four base-pairs into the RNA helix, and ``caps'' the tetraloop by stacking a tryptophan residue on top of the terminal base (Figure 1(b)). The a-helix is severely bent to follow the contour of the RNA helix. Since the RNA surface recognized by the l N peptide is similar to that recognized by the Rev peptide, it is not surprising that the pattern of contacts is qualitatively similar: two residues hydrogen bond to bases, these are ¯anked by electrostatic contacts, and several side-chains make non-polar contacts with the backbone. Particularly notable is Ala3, which is between the sugars of C4 and C5 and close to C5 ÐC6 bonds of these two pyrimidines. The interaction may be modestly selective for pyrimidines, as inversion of the base-pairs to place G bases at positions 4 and 5 causes a sixfold reduction in anti-termination activity (Chattopadhyay et al., 1995). A total of 19 amino acids have been substituted for Ala3 (Su et al., 1997); only the serine-substituted peptide is comparable in activity to the parent sequence. A requirement for a small side-chain might be expected from the way Ala3 is surrounded by RNA. In contrast to the tryptophan-base stacking interaction in the Rev-RRE complex, mutation of Trp18 in the N peptide is quite deleterious (Su et al., 1997). Other aromatic residues may substitute for a tryptophan residue, though with reduced binding af®nity. As in the Rev-RRE complex, the roles of basic residues were not accurately deduced from mutagenesis experiments. Arg7, Arg8, and Arg11 could not be replaced by a lysine residue without reduction in the binding af®nity, while positions 6, 10, and 14 could be switched between arginine and lysine but not alanine residues. It was therefore concluded that arginine residues 7, 8 , and 11 provide ``base or architecture-speci®c'' contacts and positions 6, 10 and 14 provide general electrostatic interactions (Su et al., 1997). However, it is not obvious from the structure that positions 8 and 11 interact with the RNA other than electrostatically, and Lys14 is more distant from phosphate groups Ê (6.4-7.0 A) than most other basic residues in the peptide. Measurement of the salt dependence of the binding constant would be able to distinguish purely electrostatic effects of a mutation from other interactions the mutation might affect. The bovine immunode®ciency virus (BIV) Tat protein contains an arginine-rich peptide that binds a hairpin (TAR) in the viral mRNA. NMRbased structures of nearly the same peptide and RNA hairpin sequences have been solved by two groups with essentially the same results (Puglisi et al., 1995; Ye et al., 1995). The helix contains two bulged bases, one of which (U12) is disordered and can be deleted without affecting peptide binding (Puglisi et al., 1995), and the other of which (U10) sits in the major groove making a Hoogsteen base triple with A13 (Figure 1(c)). This kinks the helix and opens the major groove wide enough for the

The following color code applies Ê to both protein and RNA schematics: red, positive charge is within 4 A of a non-bridging phosphate oxygen atom; Ê magenta, positive charge is 6-7 A from a phosphate oxygen atom; green, hydrogen bond to base; orange, hydrogen bond to backbone; blue, non-polar contact. Contacts are made by the amino acid side-chain unless speci®ed as amide (NH) or carbonyl (O). Dots on sugars indicate 4H O position. (a) Contacts between the Rev a-helix and an RNA major groove. The protein sequence is drawn on a two dimensional representation of the outside of an a-helix, as if a cylinder wrapped around the helix has been cut lengthwise and ¯attened (Crick, 1953). Amino acids in bold have at least a tenfold effect on binding af®nity when mutated to alanine (Tan et al., 1993). Bold nucleotides are invariant among RNAs selected from randomized sequences (Bartel et al., 1991). The diagrammed interactions are based on the energy-minimized average structure from NMR studies (1eft), which differs in several contacts from the diagram by Battiste et al. (1996). (b) Contacts between the l phage N peptide and an RNA hairpin major groove (Legault et al., 1998). Bold face residues in the a-helix reduce binding to less than $20 % of control in a gel shift assay (Su et al., 1997). Bases in bold face cannot be mutated without >tenfold reduction in activity (Chattopadhyay et al., 1995) or binding af®nity (Cilley & Williamson, 1997). The diagram is based on an averaged and minimized structure from NMR studies provided by P. Legault. (c) Contacts between BIV Tat protein and an RNA hairpin, based on PDB ®les 1mnb (Puglisi et al., 1995) and 1biv (Ye et al., 1995). The peptide is drawn in its b-ribbon conformation, with its two amide-carbonyl hydrogen bonds indicated as broken lines. Amino acid residues in bold face indicate <10 % activity of the peptide when substituted with alanine, in an in vivo assay (Chen & Frankel, 1995). Bases in bold face are pos-

259 of ®ve- to 50-fold (Saks & Sampson, 1996); the N7C8 bond of a purine would make a less favorable contact with Phe262. Favorable interaction between the edge of one aromatic ring and the face of another has been observed in proteins (Burley & Petsko, 1985). A last example of RNA groove recognition is a retroviral nucleocapsid protein bound to an RNA hairpin packaging signal (De Guzman et al., 1998). The protein contains two ``zinc knuckle'' domains that recognize the four-base loop. Nine residues of an N-terminal tail form a 310-helix that reaches into the adjacent major groove. Several basic residues hydrogen bond to phosphate groups, and two residues, an asparagine and an arginine, are within hydrogen bonding distance of bases. Use of a 310helix is unprecedented among DNA-binding proteins. Summary of RNA groove binding strategies RNAs from many sources form extensive canonical secondary structures, yet it is rare to ®nd even a full turn of helix uninterrupted by mismatches, bulges, or loops. The RNA-complexes discussed here, as well as other RNA structures that have been recently determined (Correll et al., 1997, 1998), show that such non-canonical interruptions may preserve an approximately helical structure but with irregular dimensions considerably different from A-form. Proteins binding to structured RNAs are therefore confronted with a diverse array of major and minor groove surfaces that present considerable opportunity for site-speci®c recognition. The structures discussed here range from a nearly ¯at minor groove, to major grooves widened by bulges and mismatches, to A-form major grooves accessed from the ends. In turn, proteins have developed a number of strategies to create ``probes'' for grooves of different dimensions: a-helix, 310-helix, b-ribbon, and irregular loop have all been observed. Proteins have been able to further adjust the effective size of these probes by using glycine residues to allow close approach of the RNA to backbone amide and carbonyl groups. To illustrate the diversity of the structures that have been discussed, Figure 2 shows ``end-on'' views of some of these protein-groove complexes. Two DNA-binding proteins that place either an ahelix or b-ribbon in the major groove are shown for contrast. The two RNA-binding peptides take advantage of the deeper RNA major groove to

the same S-shaped backbone conformation was observed for G71 in the Rev-RRE complex (Figure 1(a)). In both cases, a bulged base 3H to the ¯ipped base allows the backbone the extra length needed to rotate the nucleotide. On the other side of the helix, A1088 has displaced U1078, which then stacks with A1077 and causes an interruption in regular base stacking through the helix. L11 a-helix 3 makes four hydrogen bonds to bases, three of which involve backbone carbonyl groups (Figure 1(d)). Gly65 is essential to allow close approach of the adjacent a-helix carbonyl group to the RNA; its mutation to alanine reduces binding by about tenfold (Xing et al., 1997). The BIV Tat peptide requires glycine residue at certain positions for a similar reason. Backbone contacts are made by basic residues on one side of the helix and by non-polar contacts of one methionine sidechain with ribose sugars. The Ser69 hydroxyl hydrogen bonds to a ribose 2' hydroxyl, which is normally accessible only from the minor groove of a helix. a-Helix 3 is ¯anked at either end by loops that primarily interact with the RNA helix backbone, via hydrogen bonds to four 2H -OH and two phosphate groups and one non-polar contact between Pro27 and a ribose; the one base-speci®c contact is a hydrogen bond from Asn52 to U1058. The effects of L11 binding to this site propagate through a 58 nt domain of tertiary structure: in melting experiments, no RNA unfolding can be detected until the protein dissociates from the RNA (Xing & Draper, 1995). L11 accomplishes this directly by interacting with a tertiary base-pair, U1060 ÁA1088, that links two parts of the RNA, and indirectly by stabilizing the distorted helix structure that accommodates the intercalated A1088 and promotes other tertiary interactions. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases frequently rely on ``discriminator'' bases in the acceptor helix and 3H terminal sequence to distinguish different isoaccepting tRNA species; contacts must therefore be made in one of the acceptor stem grooves. The crystal structure of seryl-tRNA synthetase bound to its cognate tRNA shows how an irregular protein loop can extend deeply into the major groove of a helix to distinguish a base sequence (Figure 1(e)). An unusual base-speci®c contact is the packing of the ring of Phe262 against the 5,6 carbon atoms of two pyrimidines. In experiments with variant tRNA minihelices, the synthetase prefers pyrimidines at both these positions by factors

itions at which mutations reduce apparent binding af®nity >100-fold in a gel shift assay (Chen & Frankel, 1994). (d) Contacts between the C-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L11 (L11-C76) and its rRNA binding site, based on PDB ®le 1qa6 (Conn et al., 1999). In the schematic of a-helix 3, amino acid residues in bold give >tenfold reduction in binding af®nity when mutated to alanine (Xing et al., 1997). Bases in bold are conserved in >97 % of available large subunit rRNA sequences from bacteria, archaea, and eucarya (Gutell et al., 1992; Conn et al., 1999). The grey sugar for A1088 indicates that it is not contiguous with the RNA chains shown, but intercalates into the helix from a bulge loop elsewhere in the molecule.

Figure 2. Proteins binding RNA and DNA grooves and discussed in the text. The two DNA-protein complexes show only a-helix 3 of Oct-1 (Klemm et al., 1994) or the b-ribbon of met repressor (Somers & Phillips, 1992), which hydrogen bond to bases in the major groove. In the L11-C76-RNA complex, a-helix 3, which is structurally homologous to a-helix 3 shown in the Oct-1 complex, is colored.

bury more surface area against the RNA than possible for a protein binding B-form DNA. At the other extreme, L11 supplements its a-helix with loops at either end to create a large, nearly ¯at surface for binding. The RNA-protein contacts in these complexes are dictated by the chemical nature of RNA grooves. Compensation of the RNA negative charge by basic residues and hydrogen bonding to the edges of bases are two obvious strategies which all of the proteins and peptides discussed here take advantage of; the same strategies are used by proteins binding speci®c duplex DNA sequences. More surprising is the major role of non-polar contacts with ribose and the 5,6 bond of pyrimidines in many complexes. Hydrophobic amino acids frequently contact 5-methyl groups of thymine bases in DNA, and the TATA binding protein makes extensive use of aromatic and hydrophobic residues in binding the minor groove of its DNA target sequence (Kim et al., 1993), but the use of non-polar contacts seems much more common among RNA-binding proteins. Sequence-specific RNA recognition by b -sheet proteins Loops and bulges of folded RNAs may leave some nucleotides relatively unstructured, and some RNAs (such as mRNAs) contain regions of single-stranded or poorly structured nucleotides. A large fraction of the protein-RNA complexes of known structure target such regions. In contrast to the groove binders discussed above, these proteins tend to pull unstacked bases into binding pockets, composed partly or entirely of b-sheets, and ignore the RNA backbone. Several examples of this sequence-speci®c binding strategy are discussed in this section. Ribonucleoprotein consensus proteins: recognition of two RNAs by Human U1A protein One of the most widespread RNA binding domains is the so-called ribonucleoprotein (RNP) consensus sequence, sometimes also referred to as the RNA recognition motif (RRM). This class of

proteins has an babbab fold in which the ®rst and third b-strands are the middle two strands of an antiparallel sheet and contain characteristic aromatic residues (Figure 3). There are now four atomic resolution structures of RNP proteins bound to cognate RNAs: human U1A domain bound to a 21 nt RNA hairpin from U1 snRNP (Oubridge et al., 1994); the same protein bound to an mRNA internal loop (Allain et al., 1996, 1997; Howe et al., 1998); the related U2BHH -U2AH protein complex bound to a U2 snRNP hairpin; and two RNP domains of the sex-lethal gene bound to a single-stranded RNA sequence (Handa et al., 1999). (PDB entries for these complexes are 1urn, 1a9n, 1aud, and 1b7f, respectively.) Since these proteins are homologous but recognize different sequences, the structures provide an opportunity to ask how sequence speci®city is achieved. The U1A RNP domain recognizes the same RNA sequence (AUUGCAC) either in the context of a hairpin loop (stem-loop II of U1 snRNP) or internal loop (U1A mRNA polyadenylation inhibition element, PIE) (Scherly et al., 1989; van Gelder et al., 1993). The identical seven nucleotide sequence was selected by U1A protein from pools of random sequence RNA (Tsai et al., 1991), either in the context of a hairpin loop or an unstructured sequence. These results have suggested that U1A has strong sequence speci®city and little regard for RNA structure. The two U1A protein-RNA structures in fact show that the protein hydrogen bonds extensively to bases of the AUUGCAC sequence. A schematic of protein-RNA contacts is shown in Figure 3. In the U1A-RNA hairpin crystal structure, a total of 14 hydrogen bonds between the protein and the seven bases have been identi®ed; several more water-mediated base-protein hydrogen bonds were identi®ed in the crystal structure but are not shown in Figure 3 (Oubridge et al., 1994). The NMR structure of U1A with the PIE internal loop shows essentially the same conformation of the AUUCGAC sequence and pattern of hydrogen bonds with the protein (Allain et al., 1997). Three of the bases (G9, C10, and A11) are stacked against amino acid side-chains, all three of which are conserved as aromatic residues in RNP

Color-coding of the schematics are as described in the legend to Figure 1. Magenta indicates basic residues that do not contact RNA but for which substitution with glutamine is deleterious (Nagai et al., 1990); these presumably interact with the RNA electrostatic ®eld. The b-strands are numbered at the bottom of the ®gure. RNP1 and RNP2 refer to conserved sequences motifs ®rst used to identify the RNP consensus proteins and corresponding to the middle two strands of the b-sheet (reviewed by Dreyfuss et al., 1993).

consensus proteins. (One of the positions is Gln in U1A, but Phe or Tyr in most other RNP consensus proteins.) Since stacking is more favorable for purines than pyrimidines, the three aromatic protein residues might be expected to contribute a small sequence bias at the three interacting RNA bases. The fact that these positions are conserved as aromatic residues in RNP consensus proteins with many different sequence speci®cities suggest that their primary role is to orient bases on the protein surface, rather than select for particular sequences. As suggested by the pattern of protein-RNA contacts in Figure 3, RNA bases are buried in the U1A structure and the phosphate-sugar backbone is relatively exposed to solvent. There are only two salt bridges between lysine side-chains and RNA phosphate groups (Lys22 hydrogen bonds to the phosphate of A2, which is not shown in Figure 3) and no Ê other basic residues come within 5.0 A of a phosphate oxygen atom. The same is true of the U1APIE complex. This observation is in surprising contrast to solution studies, which showed that (i) most phosphate groups within the hairpin loop and several in the stem are protected by U1A protein from reaction with ethylnitrosourea (Jessen et al., 1991); (ii) hairpin binding af®nity for U1A is very sensitive to salt concentration, weakening by a factor of 200 when NaCl concentration is raised from 250 to 500 mM (Hall & Stump, 1992); and (iii) besides the basic residues hydrogen bonding with bases or phosphate groups, mutation of six more basic residues to glutamine reduce the stability of the complex (Nagai et al., 1990). The steep salt dependence of binding unambiguously indicates that the free energy of complex formation has a large electrostatic component. However, the mutagenesis and

protection studies were quite misleading as to the extent of direct contacts of basic residues with phosphates, and prompted a model in which basic residues lined the RNA backbone and left bases exposed to solvent (Jessen et al., 1991). It seems that strong electrostatic interactions in this RNA may not be associated with close distances between phosphate groups and basic residues. The AUUGCAC sequence in the context of an unstructured RNA binds U1A poorly (Tsai et al., 1991; Hall, 1994). Direct interactions of the protein with the stem of the RNA accounts for some of the additional binding free energy; thus Arg52 hydrogen bonds to the closing G ÁC base-pair in both the hairpin and internal loop RNA complexes, and additional backbone contacts are made by one or two residues in each complex. In the hairpin complex, the three bases of the loop 3H to the recognized sequence are disordered. The equivalent positions in the U1A-PIE complex are occupied by other parts of the internal loop, and make several hydrogen bonds with the protein. The RNA binding surface of U1A is formed mainly from the b-sheet surface and two other regions of the protein (Figure 3). The loop between b2 and b3 inserts into the middle of the RNA hairpin loop, bringing the N terminus of b3 into contact with the closing base-pair. Much of the recognized RNA sequence is then clamped in a groove formed from the b-sheet surface and the Cterminal sequence of the protein. The b2-b3 loop is somewhat disordered in the absence of RNA (Nagai et al., 1990), and the C-terminal region probably rearranges upon RNA binding (Avis et al., 1996). The RNA hairpin loop is also largely unstructured in the absence of protein (Oubridge

262 et al., 1994). Thus recognition should be viewed as a mutual adaptation of the structures of each macromolecule in which formation of both intraand intermolecular contacts are important. The mutual adaptation of the protein and RNA binding surfaces may account for the high cooperativity of forming the complex. Single base mutations within the seven nucleotide recognition sequence reduce the magnitude of the binding free energy by 1.4 to 7.9 kcal/mol (the larger numbers depend on a linear extrapolation of binding constants measured at low salt concentrations) (Hall, 1994). The smaller free energy changes might be expected for removal of one or two hydrogen bonding interactions (Fersht, 1987), but the very large effects associated with mutation of A6 3 C (5.2 kcal/mol), G9 3 A (7.6 kcal/mol), and A11 3 G (7.9 kcal/mol) imply that these base substitutions prevent formation of large groups of contacts and not just the hydrogen bonds made directly to the mutated base. Sequence discrimination by two similar RNP consensus proteins U2BHH , a homolog of U1A differing in only 22 out of 95 positions, binds to a hairpin from U2 snRNP that differs in only a few nucleotides from the U1 snRNP hairpin recognized by U1A. The general binding strategy and RNA contact surfaces in U1A and U2BHH are very similar (Price et al., 1998). (U2BHH requires a second protein, U2AH , in order to bind RNA. U2AH binds on the opposite face of U2BHH from the RNA and will not be discussed further here, though it may have some indirect effect on binding speci®city (Rimmele & Belasco, 1998).) As swaps of relatively few nucleotides or amino acids are able to change the preferences of U1A and U2BHH proteins for the two RNA hairpins (Scherly et al., 1990), it has been interesting to compare structures of the U1A and U2BHH complexes and ask if simple principles govern the differences in speci®city. The U2 snRNP hairpin contains the sequence AUUGCAG, which differs from the seven base recognition sequence of the U1 snRNP hairpin in only the last base. The six identical bases of each hairpin interact with their cognate protein in essentially the same way, making identical contacts with Cterminal and b1 residues. The seventh base is a C in the U1 hairpin, and ®ts tightly against the protein surface. In the U2 hairpin, a G base ®ts at the same position by adopting the syn conformation. The remaining three bases of the U1 hairpin loop remain disordered in the complex, and in fact can be replaced by ethylene glycol spacers without affecting the binding af®nity (Williams & Hall, 1996). In the U2 hairpin, these three nucleotides have been replaced by four well-ordered nucleotides that make a number of contacts with the protein. Three of the protein residues holding this part of the RNA in place are identical in U1A; thus the extra nucleotide in the hairpin loop has enabled it

RNA-Protein Recognition

to adopt a conformation which makes additional protein contacts. A particularly interesting residue is Arg52, which hydrogen bonds in different ways to bases in the two complexes. In the U1A-hairpin complex, the Arg52 guanidinium group interacts with the major groove edge of G16 in the base-pair closing the loop, and also with N1 of the neighboring A6 (Figure 3). The closing pair of the U2 hairpin is a U ÁU mismatch, rather than a C ÁG pair. Arg52 has rotated to hydrogen bond its guanidinium group to U17 phosphate and N1 of A6, and in doing so has placed its Ne atom next to O2 of U7. Thus a small change of the Arg52 side chain conformation has been used to maintain extensive hydrogen bonding in both complexes. These kinds of adaptations make it dif®cult to deduce information about protein-RNA contacts from mutagenesis studies, as substitution of a base or amino acid sidechain may create a different, compensating set of interactions. In this example, the mutation Arg52 3 Gln is very deleterious to U1A binding while Arg52 3 Lys is not, from which it was erroneously concluded that position 52 only interacts with RNA electrostatically (Jessen et al., 1991). A set of mutagenesis experiments has shown that non-polar contacts are an important aspect of discrimination in this system. In the U1A-hairpin complex, Cd of Leu44 is placed against C2 of A11 and C1H of C12. Leu44 has been replaced by Val44 in U2BHH . The smaller size of Val as compared to Leu, and the different positioning of the U2BHH syn G12 as compared to C12, allows additional contacts of the Val44 methyls with G12 C8; these contacts potentially stabilize the syn conformation of G12 and discriminate against C at this position. Rimmele & Belasco (1998) showed that substitution of Leu for Val in U2BHH increases its relative af®nity for the U1 hairpin ®vefold while decreasing its af®nity for the U2 hairpin threefold. Thus very subtle differences in geometry and non-polar contacts can signi®cantly alter binding speci®city. U2BHH makes additional non-polar contacts between Leu46 and U13, and Thr48 and C16; these interactions could also be favoring the U2 hairpin (both of these residues change to Ser in U1A). A crystal structure of the sex-lethal protein bound to a 17mer RNA, U5GUUGU7, appeared recently (Handa et al., 1999). This protein contains two RNP consensus domains that combine to recognize a continuous stretch of nine nucleotides (UGU7). The two protein domains are similar to the U1A and U2BHH proteins discussed above, and use approximately the same surfaces to contact RNA. Each of the nine recognized bases makes at least one hydrogen bond to the protein, and several aromatic and hydrophobic side-chains stack against bases as well. As the RNA is completely unstructured, recognition depends entirely on sequence. In summary, extensive hydrogen bonding between RNP consensus proteins and bases of their cognate RNAs is probably responsible for

RNA-Protein Recognition

263 TRAP recognition of repeating G/UAG The trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) of Bacillus subtilis recognizes a speci®c sequence in the leaders of the trp operon RNA and the trpG gene, where it affects formation of a transcription terminator secondary structure and/or translational ef®ciency (Babitzke, 1997). The protein-RNA binding af®nity is modulated by tryptophan, so that expression of trp genes is linked to the cellular level of tryptophan. The protein is an unusual ring of 11 identical subunits containing only b-sheet secondary structure (Antson et al., 1995). TRAP correspondingly recognizes nine to 11 repeats of trinucleotide sequence, G/UAG, optimally separated by two nucleotides (Babitzke et al., 1995). Alanine scanning mutagenesis identi®ed three basic residues, located on b-strands on the outside perimeter of the protein, that are essential for RNA recognition but do not affect tryptophan binding. At position 56 only lysine is functional, while residues 37 and 58 may be either lysine or arginine. Further studies with modi®ed nucleotides have shown that the protein is relatively insensitive to the identity of the 5H trinucleotide position, as elimination of the base (leaving an abasic site in each instance of 11 repeats) reduces binding only tenfold. In the second position, the exocyclic amine of adenine is essential, and the protein recognizes both O6 and N2 of guanine in the third position (Elliott et al., 1999). In addition, the only 2H -OH group required is in the third nucleotide of each repeat. The crystal structure of a TRAP homolog from Bacillus stearothermophilus bound to (GAGAU)11 RNA was recently solved (A.A. Antson et al., unpublished results). As in other b-sheet proteins recognizing single-stranded RNA, the RNA backbone is on the outside and the bases are placed against the b-sheet surface. Consistent with this, RNA binding is nearly independent of salt concentration (Baumann et al., 1996). The bases of the GAG repeats hydrogen bond to protein residues largely as expected from mutagenesis studies: adenine N6 and N1 hydrogen bond to Lys37; O6, N1, and N2 of guanine in the third position all hydrogen bond to either Lys56 or Arg58; and the 2H -OH group of the third ribose is hydrogen bonded to a phenylalanine residue. Additional non-polar contacts de®ne pockets for the bases. An unanticipated hydrogen bond is formed between Asp39 and N2 of the ®rst guanine base of the trinucleotide; neither alanine scanning mutagenesis or base substitutions had identi®ed either of these positions as important. A preference for pyrimidines in the spacer nucleotides has been observed in in vitro selection experiments (Baumann et al., 1997), and was thought to re¯ect the weaker stacking propensity of these bases. In support of this, the co-crystal structure does not show any protein contact with spacer nucleotides. As expected from the way TRAP binds single stranded RNA, any

much of their sequence speci®city. But this simple ``readout'' of a single-stranded RNA sequence is modulated in two ways. (i) Both the RNA and protein are partially unstructured as free macromolecules, so a lock-and-key type of docking between two complementary surfaces does not apply. Cooperative folding of the molecules upon binding results in single mutations having very large and unpredictable consequences. (ii) Non-polar residues also factor into the selectivity of a protein, as they can pack tightly around bases and promote discrimination based on size (pyrimidine versus purine) or ability to adopt unusual conformations (e.g. syn glycosidic bond). Both hydrogen bonds and nonpolar contacts are easily enumerated from a crystal structure, but their consequences for binding free energy and discrimination cannot be inferred from structure alone; further thermodynamic studies are clearly needed to understand the basis for sequence discrimination in these systems.

RNA recognition by b-barrels Many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases directly sense the anticodon sequence of their cognate tRNAs. In aspartyl, asparaginyl, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases, this discrimination is performed by a b-barrel structure which belongs to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB fold) class of proteins. This set of proteins is divided into several groups, most of which bind oligonucleotides or oligosaccarides (Murzin, 1993) and in some cases share similarity with RNP consensus proteins in the sequence of one b-strand (RNP1) (Landsman, 1992). The crystal structure of the aspartyl-speci®c enzyme with its cognate RNA shows that the three anticodon bases are pulled against the b-sheet surface, where a phenylalanine residue stacks against U35 and helps to orient the RNA on the protein (Cavarelli et al., 1993). This Phe-U35 feature is conserved in all members of this group of tRNAs and synthetases. As in RNP consensus proteins, there are two loops that extend from between two pairs of b-strands and help clamp the RNA against the b-sheet. The recent structure of a rho protein-single stranded RNA complex shows another example of sequence-speci®c contacts by an OB fold protein (Bogden et al., 1999). The protein is a hexameric, RNA-dependent ATPase involved in transcriptional termination, and binds preferentially to poly(C). Two cytidine residues are placed against the b-barrel surface and enclosed by an overhanging loop, approximately as in aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. Hydrogen bonds are made to all three positions on each base, and a phenylalanine residue stacks against one of them.

264 propensity for forming secondary structure decreases the apparent binding af®nity of an RNA (Xirasagar et al., 1998). MS2 coat protein recognition of a hairpin: sequence and structure recognition One of the best studied protein-RNA interactions is the complex between phage R17 coat protein and a hairpin from its RNA genome. This interaction, which causes translational repression of the phage replicase gene, was the ®rst speci®c RNAprotein complex to be isolated and studied in vitro (Spahr et al., 1969) and the ®rst for which RNA sequence requirements for recognition were established in detail (Uhlenbeck et al., 1990). The protein is extremely selective for the correct sequence, discriminating against other hairpins by more than six orders of magnitude in binding af®nity (Carey & Uhlenbeck, 1983). The crystal structure of the homologous complex from MS2 phage has now been determined for several RNA and protein variants Ê (Valegard et al., 1994, 1997; van den Worm et al., 1998). It is now possible to ask whether the thermodynamic selectivity of the interaction can be rationalized from the available structural information. The general features of the recognition complex are simple; RNA contacts are presented in Figure 4. Protein binding is insensitive to the speci®c basepairs present in the secondary structure; four of the ®ve remaining unpaired bases are critical. The protein binds as a dimer in which two ®ve-stranded b-sheets combine to form one large b-sheet surface. The RNA hairpin straddles the dimer interface and places A À 10 and A À 4 in symmetry-related pockets of the two monomers. The asymmetry of the RNA positions the two adenine bases differently, and different hydrogen bonds are made (note particularly the changed position of Ser47; Figure 4). Position À5 is stacked against a tyrosine

RNA-Protein Recognition

residue on one side and A À 7 on the other. A À 7, which must be a purine for strong binding, does not make any direct contact with the protein. This recognition strategy is similar to that described for the other proteins in this section, in that a b-sheet surface is used to make sequence-speci®c contacts with RNA bases. In this case the contacted bases are highly constrained in their relative orientations by the structure of the hairpin loop; for instance, A À 4 and A À 10 are held in the correct spatial orientation for binding by the intervening two base-pairs. (The hairpin loop is disordered and the À10 bulge is intercalated in the free RNA (Borer et al., 1995), but the recognized bases are still more restricted in relative position than any of the RNP consensus protein recognition sites discussed above.) To a larger degree than seen in the other bsheet proteins discussed here, RNA structure is a determinant of recognition speci®city. The changes in binding free energy caused by many variants in both the RNA and protein have been studied in attempts to understand the selectivity of each of the base-protein interactions. A large number of modi®ed bases have been substituted for the bulged A at À10, and can be at least qualitatively rationalized in terms of the crystal structure (Wu & Uhlenbeck, 1987). A À 10 makes three base-speci®c hydrogen bonds and lies in a non-polar pocket with Lys61 on one face and Val29 on the other (Figure 4). RNAs with pyrimidines at À10 do not bind detectably in most cases (>103 fold effect), perhaps because of loss of both stacking and hydrogen bonding contacts. Purine and several purines derivatives, including G, I, and deaza7A, bind with only two- to ®vefold reductions in af®nity, consistent with their ability to both stack and either accept or donate a hydrogen bond from N1 or N6. m1A reduces binding by >103, perhaps because of steric effects of the extra methyl group as well as the elimination of a hydrogen bond; similarly, m6A binds more than 100-fold 2

less well. Fewer substitutions have been made at the À4 position, where A binds $103 more tightly than C, G, or U (Carey et al., 1983). This degree of discrimination is surprising, as G would be able to form some of the same hydrogen bonds as A. A crystal structure of the RNA hairpin complexed to a Thr45Ala variant has been solved (van den Worm et al., 1998). The single mutation eliminates hydrogen bonds to both A À 4 and A À 10, yet binds only ®vefold less strongly than the wild-type protein (Lago et al., 1998). The crystal structure shows that both A À 4 and A À 10 have moved Ê only slightly, by $0.2 A. This is enough to eliminate an additional hydrogen bond (Glu63 to U À 5 O2H ). Elimination of this and the Thr45 hydrogen bonds is probably compensated in part by strengthening of other hydrogen bonds to the two nucleotides. Position À5 is U in the wild-type RNA sequence, but a C substitution surprisingly enhances binding by nearly 100-fold; A or G are discriminated against by ten- or 100-fold, respectively (Carey et al., 1983). Stacking of the base against Tyr85 provides some discrimination, as substitutions at this position are more deleterious for C binding than for U by as much as sevenfold (Johansson et al., 1998). The hydrogen bond between Asn87 and the pyrimidine O2 (Figure 4) contributes virtually no favorable free energy to RNA binding, as its mutation to Ala has no effect on C À 5 or U À 5 RNAs. However, it does serve to discriminate against the larger purine rings, as Asn87Ala binds A À 5 and G À 5 three- to ®vefold more tightly (Johansson et al., 1998). These experiments do not point to any direct protein contacts with the base at À5 as a complete explanation for the discrimination at this site. However, a crystal structure of a C À 5 RNA with MS2 coat protein shows that a new hydrogen bond has formed from the C À 5 amino group to U À 6 phosphate, and has moved Ê the À6 and À7 phosphate groups $0.5 A closer to the C À 5 base as compared to the wild-type U À 5 RNA. This shift may alter the strength of hydrogen bonds to the two non-bridging À7 phosphate oxygen atoms, and chemical modi®cations of these oxygen atoms have different effects on C À 5 and U À 5 RNAs. A last factor to be considered is that a C À 5 - phosphate hydrogen bond may help predispose the RNA loop (which is disordered in free RNA; Borer et al., 1995) to the correct conformation for RNA binding. It appears that coat binding speci®city at the RNA À5 position, which ranges over four orders of magnitude with substitutions of the four standard bases, is the net result of several relatively small effects: stacking preferences of the bases for Tyr85; steric occlusion of purines by Asn87; conformational changes propagated through the protein by an intramolecular hydrogen bond in C À 5; and the effect of C À 5 on the unbound RNA conformation. None of these effects involves a direct hydrogen bond between the protein and À5 position, which underscores the dif®culty of deducing

Electrostatic interactions in RNA-protein complexes All of the proteins discussed in this review derive some of their binding free energy from interactions of basic residues with the RNA electrostatic ®eld, and it is relevant to ask (i) to what extent an RNA-binding protein depends on electrostatic interactions and (ii) how basic residues are arranged on the surface of a protein to enhance binding af®nity. Three kinds of experiments have been used in answering these questions, and each approach has distinct limitations which need to be kept in mind. To distinguish basic residues that interact solely with the electrostatic ®eld from those in which the speci®c geometry of the side-chain is essential, variants with arginine, lysine, or a neutral residue (e.g. alanine or glutamine) at a position are frequently compared. If the position can tolerate lysine or arginine but not other side-chains, the interactions are presumed to depend only on positive charge and thus to be entirely electrostatic. A speci®c requirement for an arginine or lysine residue implies that the chemical nature of the sidechain is important, and other kinds of interactions are implied. This approach was ®rst used to distinguish speci®c RNA contacts from general electrostatic interactions in an arginine-rich peptide from HIV Tat protein (Calnan et al., 1991; Tao & Frankel, 1993), and has since been applied to a number of the complexes discussed here. While the reasoning behind this approach seems sound, the correspondence between such mutagenesis data and actual structures is much poorer than anticipated. In several cases that have been mentioned, Arg52 of U1A protein and Lys56 and Arg58 of TRAP, mutagenesis of the residue in question ®ts the criterion of an amino acid that is important only for electrostatic interactions. Contrary to expectation, all of these residues make speci®c hydrogen bonds to RNA bases. In addition, those residues predicted to be engaged in electrostatic interactions do not necessarily make ``ionic contact'' with phosphate groups as sometimes assumed. The Rev-RRE complex is a good example: several arginine residues that approach Ê phosphate groups as closely as 3.0 A can be mutated to alanine with little effect on binding af®Ê nity, while others that place positive charges 6-7 A distant from the nearest phosphate were identi®ed as important. In an irregular RNA structure, calculations have shown that there may be large variations in electrostatic ®eld strength which cannot easily be inferred by inspection of the structure (Sharp et al., 1990). Thus the effect of a basic residue mutation on the RNA binding free energy is not necessarily proportional to its distance from the nearest phosphate; calculations are needed to

266 discern the electrostatic ®eld expected in the vicinity of a basic residue. Ethylnitrosourea footprinting identi®es phosphate groups protected from alkylation when protein binds (Ehresmann et al., 1987); ethylation interference locates phosphate groups at which ethylation weakens protein binding. Both experiments have been presumed to map phosphate groups that hydrogen bond to either basic or polar amino acids. Unfortunately, the correlation between ethylation protection or interference and phosphate-protein hydrogen bonds is poor. The most dramatic example discussed here is U1A protein, which protected many phosphate groups in the recognized RNA loop sequence and prompted a model with the phosphates against the protein and bases exposed to solvent (Jessen et al., 1991), the opposite of the actual case. In the Rev-RRE complex, only three of ®ve phosphate groups at which interference was observed are hydrogen bonded in the complex, and four other hydrogen bonded phosphate groups were missed (Kjems et al., 1992). Lastly, the salt dependence of protein-RNA binding af®nity measures the extent of electrostatic interactions. Since cations screen the electrostatic ®eld of an RNA, increasing salt concentration should decrease the association constant of a protein that relies on electrostatic interactions (Record et al., 1976). When oligopeptides of lysine or arginine bind long single-stranded or double-stranded RNA polymers, each additional basic residue makes the slope of a plot of log(Ka) versus log[M] more negative by a ®xed increment which is related to the density of the ion atmosphere around the nucleic acid (Mascotti & Lohman, 1990, 1997). Unfortunately, a simple proportionality between the number of basic residues with electrostatic interactions and the slope of log(Ka) versus log[M] does not hold for RNA binding proteins. First, a proportionality factor can be estimated only for regular, in®nitely long polymers. The relatively short RNAs studied in experiments with sitespeci®c binding proteins should have very large ``end effects'' (Olmsted et al., 1989) and their irregular structures require detailed calculations to estimate the extent of ion association. Second, the contributions of basic residues within a protein are not necessarily additive, as has been shown recently with single and double mutants in basic residues of L11 protein (D. GuhaThakurta & D.E.D., unpublished results). There has been an attempt to correlate the number of basic residuephosphate contacts in the MS2 coat protein-RNA complex with the salt dependence of binding af®nity (Carey & Uhlenbeck, 1983; LeCuyer et al., 1996). The interpretation of the salt dependence cannot be correct for the reasons mentioned here. Much more sophisticated calculations, as have been done for some protein-DNA complexes (Misra et al., 1994), are needed to analyze electrostatic interactions in this complex.

RNA-Protein Recognition

Though salt dependence data are dif®cult to interpret quantitatively, it is possible to identify basic residues making electrostatic contributions by measuring the salt dependence of proteins with neutral substitutions. In this way, six out of nine basic residues tested in L11 protein were found to contribute to salt dependence of RNA binding (D.G. & D.E.D., unpublished results). Five of these residues hydrogen bond to phosphate oxygen atoms, while the sixth is further away from the RNA backbone. This approach is particularly useful as it easily distinguishes mutations that weaken binding without affecting electrostatic interactions (i.e. the binding constant decreases but the slope of log(Ka) versus log[M] is unchanged) from those that affect only electrostatic interactions. Mutual accommodation In almost all of the cases discussed here, complex formation is accompanied by some degree of mutual accommodation between the RNA and protein binding surfaces, most commonly as a disorder 3 order transition upon binding, but sometimes as a conformational rearrangement. Thus NMR and CD studies of the separate and complexed components of the BIV TAT-Tar and RevRRE complexes show that both the peptide and RNA fold upon binding (Battiste et al., 1994; Tan & Frankel, 1994; Chen & Frankel, 1995; Puglisi et al., 1995); a 14 residue loop of the L11 RNA binding domain is completely unstructured in the absence of RNA, but becomes as ordered as the rest of the protein upon binding (Markus et al., 1997); and the stacked, U-turn structure of the tRNAAsp anticodon loop is thoroughly disrupted upon binding to its cognate synthetase (Cavarelli et al., 1993). In two cases, the box B hairpin bound by the l N peptide and the L11-rRNA complex, the free RNA can be stabilized in the bound conformation by single base mutations, but this appears to be the exception rather than the rule. The unfavorable reduction in entropy that accompanies ordering of protein and RNA surfaces should reduce the stability of the complex, and stabilization of either protein or RNA folds can enhance binding af®nity (Tan et al., 1993; Xing & Draper, 1995). One might ask why natural selection has not generated more rigid RNA and protein structures with higher af®nities. The simplest possibility is that there may not be selective pressure to construct more elaborate protein or RNA structures with tighter binding af®nity. Factors which transiently associate with an RNA should not bind too tightly, and proteins irreversibly associated with an RNA (as in ribosomes) are frequently held in place by cooperative interactions with other proteins. It is also possible that a small, ¯exible loop in a protein is a more cost-effective way to augment the RNA binding af®nity of a protein than synthesis of a larger and more rigid structure. Rigid structures may be undesirable: some RNA target sites must be able to fold and unfold easily (e.g. in

mRNAs), and the ability of a protein to envelop RNA bases with ¯exible loops could be advantageous for speci®city. Lastly, the propensity of RNAs for forming alternative folds (Gluick et al., 1997; Pan & Woodson, 1998) may simply mean that it is dif®cult to evolve an RNA with unique secondary and tertiary structure. Similarities between DNA and RNA-binding proteins Since RNA adopts a much greater variety of non-canonical and tertiary structures than does DNA, one might have expected that the bestiary of RNA-binding proteins would be more exotic than the corresponding collection of DNA-binding proteins. But so far it appears that most of the protein frameworks for RNA recognition are not much different from duplex and single-strand-speci®c DNA binding proteins. Figure 2 makes this point clear for groove-binding proteins. The same is true for b-sheet proteins; for example, replication protein A holds single-stranded DNA bases against a b-sheet surface (Bochkarev et al., 1997) in exactly the same way as RNP consensus proteins and other b-sheet RNA-binding proteins considered here. Of course RNA-binding proteins can potentially combine domains to recognize large and complex RNA shapes, as do aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that require the anticodon loop and acceptor stem to be in the correct spatial orientation (Perret et al., 1992). But at the binding domain level, RNA and DNA binding proteins do not appear fundamentally different. Similarities between DNA and RNA binding strategies imply that the two sets of proteins may not have evolved independently. The strong structural homologies between L11 and homeodomain proteins (Xing et al., 1997) or OB fold proteins binding both RNA and DNA (Bochkarev et al., 1997; Bogden et al., 1999) suggest (but do not prove) evolutionary relatedness. Thus the ribosome, which must include some of the ®rst nucleic acid binding proteins to evolve, may have served as a reservoir of nucleic acid binding motifs during evolution.
