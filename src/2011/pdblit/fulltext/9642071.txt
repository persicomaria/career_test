Integration of retroviral cDNA is a necessary step in viral replication. The virally encoded integrase protein and DNA sequences at the ends of the linear viral cDNA are required for this reaction. Previous studies revealed that truncated forms of Rous sarcoma virus integrase containing two of the three protein domains can carry out integration reactions Ê in vitro. Here, we describe the crystal structure at 2.5 A resolution of a fragment of the integrase of Rous sarcoma virus (residues 49-286) containing both the conserved catalytic domain and a modulatory DNAbinding domain (C domain). The catalytic domains form a symmetric dimer, but the C domains associate asymmetrically with each other and together adopt a canted conformation relative to the catalytic domains. A binding path for the viral cDNA is evident spanning both domain surfaces, allowing modeling of the larger integration complexes that are known to be active in vivo. The modeling suggests that formation of an integrase tetramer (a dimer of dimers) is necessary and suf®cient for joining both viral cDNA ends at neighboring sites in the target DNA. The observed asymmetric arrangement of C domains suggests that they could form a rotationally symmetric tetramer that may be important for bridging integrase complexes at each cDNA end.

Introduction
Following infection by a retrovirus, the reversetranscribed cDNA genome must be integrated into a host chromosome for replication to proceed (for reviews, see Cof®n et al., 1997; Hansen et al., 1998). The DNA cutting and joining reactions mediating cDNA integration have been characterized in detail (Figure 1(a) and (b)). Prior to integration, two nucleotides are removed from each cDNA 3H end (Brown et al., 1989; Fujiwara & Mizuuchi, 1988), a reaction that may serve to remove heterogeneous extra nucleotides occasionally added by reverse transcriptase (Miller et al., 1997; Patel & Preston, 1994). The recessed 3H DNA ends are then transferred by integrase to the host target DNA (Brown et al., 1987, 1989; Fujiwara & Mizuuchi, 1988). Integration of both viral ends at sites in opposite

strands of the target DNA is termed the ``coupled'' or ``concerted'' integration reaction (Figure 1(b)). Each retrovirus displays a characteristic spacing between points of joining, six base-pairs in the case of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). This intermediate is then processed, presumably by host DNA repair enzymes, to yield a fully integrated provirus. Puri®ed integrases can remove two nucleotides from the 3H ends of model substrate DNAs (Bushman & Craigie, 1991; Craigie et al., 1990; Katzman et al., 1989; Sherman & Fyfe, 1990), and direct the joining of the cDNA ends into target DNA in vitro (Bushman et al., 1990; Craigie et al., 1990; Katz et al., 1990). Integrase or its catalytically active fragments can carry out an apparent reversal of the joining step, termed ``disintegration'' (Chow et al., 1992) (Figure 1(a)). Retroviral integrases comprise three protein domains. The amino-terminal domains (N domains) promote DNA binding, enzyme multimerization or both. The larger central domain (amino acid residues 50-217) contains the catalytic

A pre-integration complex is shown at the top composed of two cDNA ends and proteins including integrase (gray). Joining of each of the two viral 3H cDNA ends by integrase produces the coupled integration intermediate shown at the right. The sites of integration on opposing DNA strands are separated by six base-pairs in the case of avian inte-

center. A fragment containing only this domain can carry out the permissive disintegration reaction (Bushman et al., 1993; Bushman & Wang, 1994; Kulkosky et al., 1995; Vink et al., 1993). The C-terminal region of retroviral integrases is important for non-speci®c DNA binding and multimerization (Andrake & Skalka, 1995; Engelman et al., 1994; Mumm & Grandgenett, 1991; Puras Lutzke et al., 1994; van Gent et al., 1991). The structures of each domain of HIV-1 integrase and the catalytic domain of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) have been solved as isolated fragments by either crystallography or solution NMR methods. The zinc-binding amino-terminal domain (residues 1-49) comprises a three-helix bundle resembling a homeodomain, an unusual conformation for a zinc-binding protein (Cai et al., 1997; Eijkelenboom et al., 1997). The fold of the catalytic domain (solved crystallographically for HIV and ASV) is composed of a ®ve-stranded a/b fold and resembles the structures of several other enzymes involved in polynucleotide phosphotransfer reactions (Yang & Steitz, 1995). The catalytic domain is proposed to dimerize with 2-fold rotational symmetry, as inferred from crystal contacts in both the HIV and ASV structures (Bujacz et al., 1995; Dyda et al., 1994). As a consequence of this dimerization, the two active centers are placed distant from each other, essentially on opposite sides of the complex. The carboxyl-terminal region encompasses a small domain (C domain; residues 220-270) with a ®vestranded b-barrel fold resembling an SH3 (Src homology) domain (Lodi et al., 1995; Plasterk, 1995). Solution NMR studies of the isolated HIV C domains propose a dimer model with 2-fold symmetry. In the case of RSV integrase, two-domain derivatives containing only the catalytic and carboxylterminal domains (residues 49-286) are capable of carrying out the full terminal cleavage and strand transfer reactions (Bushman & Wang, 1994). In an effort to obtain structural information on such derivatives, we constructed four mutant forms of RSV IN 49-286, characterized their activities in vitro, and tested each for its propensity to crystallize. One of the mutants studied, containing the change F199K, formed diffraction-quality crystals in two space groups, allowing solution of the structure to Ê 2.5 A resolution.

The disintegration reaction was previously found to be more permissive than the terminal cleavage and strand transfer reactions, allowing, for example, the demonstration of catalytic activity by isolated catalytic domains of RSV and HIV integrases (Bushman et al., 1993; Bushman & Wang, 1994; Kulkosky et al., 1995; Vink et al., 1993). The dumbbell form of the molecule (Figure 2(a)) is convenient for studies in vitro, since it is formed from a single DNA chain and does not require annealing of multiple oligonucleotides. Disintegration, involving the attack of the 3H hydroxyl group on the branch-point in the Y-shaped substrate, results in the release of the labeled DNA branch (Figure 2(b)). Here, we introduce the use of a dumbbell disintegration substrate for studies of RSV integrase. All the proteins studied were capable of carrying out disintegration on the dumbbell substrate (Figure 2(c)), indicating that the active sites were functionally intact. Crystallization of RSV IN 49-286 F199K The various mutant forms crystallized rapidly, generally producing only clusters of thin, stacked plates. Only mutant form F199K produced crystals suitable for diffraction experiments. Interestingly, position F199 in RSV integrase is near a position

Results and Discussion
Site-directed mutagenesis to improve crystal growth A protein fragment containing two of the three domains (residues 49-286) of RSV integrase crystallized readily, but failed to produce diffractionquality crystals. Therefore, we generated and characterized mutant derivatives with the goal of improving crystallization. Mutant forms were designed using the crystal structures of the closely related ASV integrase catalytic domain (amino acid residues 49-217) (Bujacz et al., 1995, 1997). We mutated residue positions in a hydrophobic surface region of the protein far from the active site to introduce additional charge: mutations A190K, L196K, and F199K. Another mutant form, RSV IN 58-286, removed a region that was apparently disordered in the ASV catalytic domain structure. Terminal cleavage and strand transfer activities of RSV IN 49-286 and derivatives RSV IN 49-286 and mutant derivatives were over-expressed, puri®ed and tested for in vitro activity using end-labeled oligonucleotide substrates. For terminal cleavage assays, two oligonucleotides were annealed to generate a duplex DNA matching one end of the unintegrated RSV cDNA (Figure 1(a), top). Terminal cleavage generates a labeled DNA strand two bases shorter than the starting substrate. Strand transfer results in the insertion of the recessed 3H hydroxyl group into another oligonucleotide duplex serving as the integration target (Figure 1(a), bottom), generating labeled DNA strands that are longer than the starting substrate. Full-length RSV integrase, RSV IN 49-286, and RSV IN 49-286 F199K each display terminal cleavage and strand transfer activities (Figure 1(c), lanes 2, 5, and 6). RSV IN 49-286 A190K displays little correct cleavage (at the À2 position) and no detectable strand transfer (lane 4). RSV IN 58-286 displays no correct cleavage or strand transfer (lane 3). RSV IN 49-286 L196K displayed poor solubility during puri®cation and was not studied further. All proteins tested carry out a non-biological cleavage at the À3 position, an activity that has been seen with other mutant derivatives (Bujacz et al., 1997). Evidently, some of the alterations in RSV IN 49-286 cause a mis-positioning of the substrate, resulting in ectopic cleavage. Dumbbell disintegration activity of two-domain RSV IN constructs The observation that some of the derivatives showed little or no correct terminal cleavage and strand transfer activity (RSV IN 58-286 and 49-286 A190K) raised the question of whether the active sites were still intact. To investigate this, RSV IN and derivatives were tested for the ability to carry

on the homologous surface of the HIV catalytic domain where the change F185K was found to improve solubility (Dyda et al., 1994; Jenkins et al., 1996). In an attempt to improve crystal quality, various cryo-protectants were tested. We discovered that the addition of 25 % ethylene glycol to initial crystal conditions reduced nucleation, and produced two diffraction-quality crystal forms, the monoclinic (P21) and the triclinic (P1) crystals. Ethylene glycol improved the reproducibility of crystallization and enabled direct freezing of the crystals for cryogenic data collection. Selenomethionine-substituted protein crystallized poorly under these conditions until we discovered that the addition of 20 mM imidazole (pH 6.7) improved the quality of the monoclinic form.

Overview of the RSV 49-286 F199K model The model of the two-domain integrase is presented in Figure 3. Residues 49-213 comprise a compact globular domain similar to the catalytic domains of HIV and ASV integrase solved previously (Bujacz et al., 1995; Dyda et al., 1994). The RSV catalytic domains are tethered by ``linker regions'' (residues 214-219) to the C domains (residues 220-270). The fold of each C domain monomer, resembling an SH3 (Src homology) domain, is similar to that reported previously for the HIV C domain (HIV residues 220-270) determined by solution NMR methods (Eijkelenboom et al., 1995; Lodi et al., 1995). The C domains associate as a tight dimer but are canted relative to the 2-fold symmetry axis of the catalytic domains (Figure 3(a)). Canted conformations are seen in both crystal forms (Figure 3(b)). The two C domains in each dimer associate in a manner much different from that proposed from NMR studies of the domain from HIV (Eijkelenboom et al., 1995; Lodi et al., 1995). The two polypeptide chains within each dimer can be distinguished as ``proximal'' and ``distal'', depending on whether its C domain is nearer to or more distant from its catalytic domain, respectively. The catalytic domain The fold of the catalytic domain and its dimer interface is similar to those observed in the related HIV (Dyda et al., 1994) and closely related ASV integrase domains (Bujacz et al., 1995). The catalytic domains have an a/b structure formed from a ®ve-stranded b-sheet sandwiched between ®ve

Solution of the two-domain RSV integrase structure The RSV IN 49-286 F199K structure was solved Ê initially at 3.2 A resolution using multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing of a monoclinic P21 crystal containing integrase substituted with selenomethionine (Table 1). A partially re®ned monoclinic structure was used to solve the Ê 2.5 A resolution triclinic crystal form by molecular replacement. Prior attempts using molecular replacement methods were successful in locating two and four catalytic domains in the P21 and the P1 cells, respectively, using the crystal structure from ASV (Bujacz et al., 1995). However, no C domain position could be found using either monomer or dimer models of the HIV C domain solved by NMR (Lodi et al., 1995).

Figure 3. Crystal structure of RSV integrase 49-286. (a) Ribbon diagram of the 49-286 dimer in the triclinic crystal form. Residue numbers mark the range of observed residues at the N or C termini of each fragment. The polypeptide chains are designated proximal (blue) or distal (green). The three acidic residues (D64, D121, and E157) in each chain comprise the active center (red triangles) in the catalytic domains. Linker residues (strand 6) connect the two domains. The C domain dimer is canted by 50  (monoclinic form) and 60  (triclinic form) relative to the local 2-fold axis (gray) of the catalytic domain dimer. C domain strands are labeled 1H through 5H ; strand 2H from a typical SH3 fold is designated here as two shorter strands, 2H * and 2H . The C-terminal residues (from about 270 to 286) are disordered in all crystal forms. (b) Canted conformations of the two-domain integrase are seen in different crystal forms. Following superposition of the triclinic (blue) and monoclinic (orange) crystal forms on the basis of the catalytic domains (not shown), the C domains differ in tilt by about 20  . The view is at a right-angle to that shown in (a). The conformation of the second dimer of the triclinic unit cell (not shown) is similar to the triclinic (blue) conformation shown. The asymmetric orientation of the C domain dimer positions one C domain much closer to its catalytic domain (the ``proximal''chain).

a-helices (Bujacz et al., 1995, 1997; Dyda et al., 1994; Goldgur et al., 1998; Maignan et al., 1998). The catalytic centers are formed by a metal-binding cluster of three acidic residues; Asp64, Asp121, and Glu157. A nearby loop (residues 145-154) is well resolved in both distal subunits of the triclinic crystal (Figure 4). These residues are either partially or completely disordered in previous structure reports of isolated catalytic domains (Bujacz et al., 1995; Dyda et al., 1994; Goldgur et al., 1998; Greenwald et al., 1999). Like many other ``¯exible loops'' in other enzymes, it may achieve a ®xed conformation only when substrate is bound. The crystal structure of the two-domain RSV protein also provides a view of the C-terminal portion of the catalytic domain of the avian retroviral enzymes. The last ten residues of the ASV construct (encoding residues 54-209) are disordered (Bujacz et al., 1995). Residues 200-207 in RSV integrase form a small hairpin loop projection similar to residues 186-195 in HIV integrase (Dyda et al., 1994). RSV residues 208-213 also form a short helical segment (helix F) similar to HIV residues 196201. The side-chain of His212 in helix F forms a

hydrogen-bonding network with the side-chains of Asp82 and Ser85 (Figure 5).

Figure 5. The asymmetric linker. Stereo view of the linker region between the catalytic and C domains, oriented as in Figure 1(a). The canted orientation of the C domain dimer is elicited through asymmetric contacts within the linker region; the parallel b-strands hydrogen bond (green dots) out of register from the sequence. Residues Trp213 and Ile209, located near the dyad of the catalytic dimer, form a hydrophobic core apparently stabilizing this part of the catalytic domain. A hydrogen bond network between His212 and residues Ser85, Asp82 and Ile112 also appear to anchor helix F to the catalytic domain. Residue numbers from the proximal subunit are marked with an asterisk (*).

In previous crystal structures, the catalytic domain interface was formed through contacts between neighboring molecules in the crystal, leaving open the question of whether this interface was merely a consequence of crystal packing. In the two-domain structure, however, we see this dimer occurring in the absence of crystal symmetry, bolstering the idea that it exists in solution. This subunit arrangement places the two active centers on opposite sides of the dimer, evidently too far apart for both to participate in a coupled joining reaction involving both viral cDNA ends spaced by six base-pairs in the target DNA. As discussed below, preservation of this interface forces one to invoke higher-order assemblies, such as tetramers.

The C domains The C domain monomer comprises ®ve b-strands in a barrel-like SH3 fold (residues 220270). Structures of the C domain monomers of HIV (Eijkelenboom et al., 1995; Lodi et al., 1995) solved by NMR are very similar to RSV C domains. Figure 6(a) shows a structure-based sequence alignment of RSV and HIV, and the level of sequence conservation among other representative retroviral species. Because many conserved residues are those evidently responsible for stabilizing this fold, it seems likely that this fold is conserved in all species. The sequence and length of the linkers and the C-terminal residues (those outside of the SH3-like domain fold) are poorly conserved between retroviral strains. Sequences of HIV and SIV integrases suggest that their linkers are longer by about 13 residues. Structural asymmetry of the RSV integrase C domain dimer In both our crystal structures of the two-domain RSV integrase, the C domain monomers (Figure 6(b)) dimerize asymmetrically. The C domain dimer interface is formed by strands 1H , 2H and 5H (residues 222-224, 239, 242, and 265-268) from the proximal monomer and strands 2H , 3H and 4H from the distal monomer (residues 240-244, 246, and 259. Except for minor differences in surface side-chains, the proximal and distal domains are very similar in conformation. In our models, the superposition of the C domains requires a rotation of one domain by just over 90  about an axis passing near the end of the linker residues (Figure 6(b)). The rotations are 93  in the monoclinic form and 97  in the triclinic forms. The asymmetrical association of C-domains and the ``out of register'' parallel strand interactions in

The linker region Residues 214-219 (b-strand 6) link the catalytic domains with the C domain (Figures 3 and 5). The indole side-chains of Trp213 at the end of helix 5 stack with each other across the dyad (Figure 5), marking the point at which the polypeptide chains begin to deviate from the 2-fold symmetry of the catalytic domain dimer. Strands 6 from both monomers hydrogen-bond to form a parallel two-stranded b-sheet. However, the pairing of residues 214-217 from the proximal chain with residues 216-218 from the distal chain are ``out of register'' (Figure 5), evidently forcing the canted conformation seen in the C domain dimer. In the HIV domain structure, helices 5 extend further, anti-parallel across the dyad. It is not clear at present whether this represents a real difference in the structures, or if the extended helical conformation of the HIV construct is a consequence of having been truncated just beyond that position. The amino acid sequences in this region of HIV, RSV, and other integrases are not conserved.

RSV and HIV residues 220-270 are aligned, along with a consensus sequence derived from 13 retroviruses (after Puras Lutzke et al., 1994); RSV sequence numbering is shown. b-Strands are indicated by colored arrows. Highly conserved residues (found in 11 or more of the 13 sequences) are highlighted orange, highly conserved basic residues are cyan. The remaining consensus residues are green. Loops varying in both length and sequence between retroviral species are labeled. (b) Stereo view of conserved amino acid side-chains and residues comprising the dimer interface. Conserved residues are colored as in (a); non-conserved residues are gray. Note the highly conserved basic residues clustered with Trp233 on the surface of the C domain. The view is shown looking down a rotation axis (arrow) located near the ends of the linker residues that can roughly superimpose the C domains though an approximate 90  rotation.

the linker residues are both likely responsible for the canted conformation of the C-domains (Figure 3(b)). Canted conformations are observed in both crystallographic space groups, despite different crystal packing. In the P1 crystal form, C domain dimers form crystal contacts with other C domains through neighboring distal domains, whereas in the P21 form, contacts are made through the proximal domains. In view of the number of hydrogen bonds in the linker and intermolecular contacts between, one cannot assume that the asymmetrical packing of C domains is forced by the crystal lattice. There must be, however, some degree of ¯exibility in the linker region, since the C domains in the two crystal forms differ in tilt (Figure 3(b)) by about 20  . Crystal contacts, therefore, may be responsible for modulating the observed tilt, but not the overall asymmetry in the integrase dimer. The N-terminal residues of the proximal subunits interact with both the proximal C domain and proximal core domain at their interface. Flexibility of the linker region might therefore be due to the absence of the N domain in our construct.

Comparison with HIV C domain structures The dimer interface observed here differs dramatically from that reported from NMR studies of the isolated domains from HIV integrase (Figure 7). The NMR structures (Eijkelenboom et al., 1995; Lodi et al., 1995) show a symmetrical dimer where the SH3 folds interact through b-strands 2H , 3H , and 4H . In our model, the same 2H , 3H , and 4H b-strands are used by the distal monomer, but these pack against strands 1H , 2H , and 5H of the proximal monomer. Surface area calculations show that the buried surface areas in the two viral species are similar (about 850 A2 for RSV and about 720 A2 for HIV; PDB code 1IHV). For either the solution NMR or crystallography studies, the observed structures could, in principle, be an artifact of using fragments at high concentrations. For example, the HIV C domain fragments might associate differently in the presence of the N and core domains. It may be that the RSV C domain dimer is symmetric in the presence of the missing N domain. Because integrase sequences vary most in the C-terminal regions, it is possible that the two proteins assemble differently in vivo.

Figure 7. Comparison of RSV and HIV C domain dimerization. The distal domain of the RSV structure superimÊ poses on an HIV monomer (PDB ID: 1IHV) with an r.m.s. deviation in Ca positions of about 1.2 A (excluding insertions). However, the adjoining subunits of RSV and HIV integrase do not superimpose. The HIV dimer is shown with its local 2-fold axis aligned vertically.

As discussed below, we show how the asymmetric C domain interface seen in our structure can be readily extended to provide a possible tetramerization motif. The observed C domain dimer, as we propose, may be one half of a catalytically relevant tetramer. Another possibility is that both dimerization modes are functionally relevant. The protein may perhaps be able to arrange itself for different purposes. For example, integrase may form different multimers in coupled integration complexes at the sites of catalysis, at distant locations within integration complexes, and even other complexes important at other points in the retroviral life-cycle. Modeling protein-DNA interactions The observed canted dimers provides the basis for modeling plausible integration complexes (Figure 8 ). A viral cDNA end is docked with its 3H OH end at the active center on the observed dimer structure so as to contact the C domains. The best ®t (using an idealized linear double-stranded B-DNA model) involves simultaneous contacts with both proximal and distal C domains and the catalytic center of the proximal domain. Due to the asymmetrical association of the C domains, the face of the C domain dimer presented to the proximal active site displays two prominent basic surface patches (Figure 8(a)) available for binding with the acidic phosphodiester backbone of the viral DNA end. If the viral DNA 3H -end is ®rst docked into the alternative (distal) subunit active center, it would fail to reach the basic patches on the C domains. Others have reported that bases about 7-11 positions from the 3H -end of the cDNA bind to the C domain (Esposito & Craigie, 1998; Heuer & Brown, 1997). The monoclinic model, with its slightly greater domain tilt (Figure 3(b)), provides better charge complementarity between

the DNA and basic residues on the protein. Since this model suggests that each viral end binds to two C domains, it follows that at least a dimer of dimers (or tetramer) must be formed in the coupled joining complex. Modeling integrase-DNA complexes involved in coupled-joining Complete integrase-DNA complexes must accommodate three DNA segments: both of the two viral cDNA ends and the target DNA (Figure 1(b)). Although only two catalytic centers are required in principle, one for joining each cDNA end, it does not seem possible to construct a model using both active sites of a single crystallographically observed dimer. Therefore, our models invoke tetramers in which only two of the four active sites are involved in catalysis. The points of joining in the target DNA are known to be spaced six bases apart on opposite strands, corresponding to opposite sides of a single major grove (Pryciak et al., 1992; Pryciak & Varmus, 1992; Pruss et al., 1994a). Cross-linking studies in the HIV system indicate that the cDNA terminal bases are bound by the catalytic domain, while more distal cDNA sequences bind to the C-terminal domain (Esposito & Craigie, 1998; Heuer & Brown, 1997). Points of close approach between HIV integrase and substrate DNA have also been mapped in adduct interference experiments (Bushman & Craigie, 1992; Chow & Brown, 1994). In the following, we assume that the general conclusions from these HIV studies hold for RSV, though further data from the RSV system will be needed to con®rm this. In the ®rst of two classes of models (class I) for the full integration complex, the model was constructed by arranging two complexes of an integrase dimer/viral DNA end (presented in Figure 8) onto a model target DNA at the two integration

543 sites (Figure 9(a) and (b)). This model is effectively a dimer of dimers, with an axis of 2-fold symmetry relating the two cDNA/dimer complexes and the target DNA between the sites of integration. The interface between dimers was adjusted to accommodate the three DNAs, while minimizing overlap between the protein domains. The described arrangement leads to a reasonable interdigitation of the carboxyl domain dimers and a tight interface between the catalytic domains. A bent target DNA provides a better ®t, in accord with biochemical experiments, indicating that integration is favored at widened sites in major grooves in nucleosomes (Muller & Varmus, 1994; Pruss et al., 1994a,b). The second model (class II) employs a similar dimer of dimers arrangement with one important exception that makes use of the asymmetrical arrangement of C domain dimers. Since the rotation relating the two C domain monomers in the dimer is roughly 90  , two more monomers can be added to a dimer, each using the same crystallographic interface, to form a closed tetramer. In this rotationally symmetric C domain tetramer model, each of the four domain interfaces matches the dimer interface observed in the crystals (Figure 9(c)). Both full-length RSV integrase and the C domain alone have been reported to form tetramers in solution (Andrake & Skalka, 1995), consistent with this idea. A key feature of our modeling is that formation of an integrase tetramer can satisfy many requirements for coupled integration of the two cDNA ends. At present, we do not have enough information to distinguish between class I and class II models. Integrase dimers in their crystallographically observed canted conformations could not be assembled into the proposed class II tetramer unless the protein ¯exes at the interdomain linkers. If such a movement is made, the viral cDNA can be bound to conserved basic residues on the tetramer, thus also satisfying the constraints described above. In this arrangement, the catalytic domains also ®t well on the DNA substrates and form a plausible dimer interface (Figure 9(d)). Because this model involves distortion of the observed conformation, we cannot distinguish between several possibilities for covalent connectivity between the four catalytic domains and the C domains. How-

Figure 8. Proposed docking site for the end of the viral cDNA. (a) The two-domain integrase dimer structures in their canted conformations present a basic surface spanning regions of both C domains and the proximal catalytic domain. An idealized model of BDNA (ribbon ®gure) can be positioned with its 3H end at the active center (red patch) of the proximal subunit and docked to make contact with a number of basic residues on the protein surface of both domains. The electrostatic

surface potential map (GRASP surface) shows basic and acidic regions in blue and red, respectively. The orientation shown is at an approximate right-angle to that of Figure 3(a). Residues with yellow labels belong to the distal subunit. (b) Ribbon ®gures of the DNA docking model from the same view. Proximal and distal polypeptide chains are colored blue and green, respectively. Active-center residues are marked by red spheres. The local 2-fold axis of the catalytic domains is shown by the nearly vertical gray line. The conformation of the protein in the P21 crystal form is shown in (a) and (b).

Figure 9. Models for DNA binding and coupled integration by RSV IN 49-286. (a) Class I model for coupled integration based on the crystallographically observed conformation. The overall complex is a dimer of dimers (orange/ yellow and blue/cyan for distal/ proximal pairs). The active proximal protomers interact tightly near the overall 2-fold axis (red diamond). Distal catalytic domains located at outer edges of the complex are proposed to not participate in catalysis. Proximal C domains (yellow and cyan) cluster near the dyad. Proximal and distal catalytic domains are labeled P and D, and proximal and distal C-domains are label Cp and Cd, respectively. Each viral cDNA end (green and violet) binds primarily to the proximal catalytic domain and both C domains of one integrase dimer. The target DNA is obscured in this view. (b) Class I model, bottom view, showing the target DNA segment (red), two viral cDNA 3H -ends (green and violet) and the two active centers of the proximal subunits. The curved target DNA segment (red) preferred by integrase is taken from the nucleosome core structure (Luger et al., 1997). Active-sites and points of joining in the target DNA are marked with arrows. (c) Model for a C domain tetramer. A symmetric tetramer with 4-fold symmetry follows readily if two additional monomers are added and rotated 90  relative to its neighbors using the same rotation axis that relates proximal and distal monomers (red diamond). Coloring is by secondary structure as in Figure 2(a). (d) Class II model for coupled integration based on the hypothetical tetramer of C domains (top view). The catalytic and C domains in each monomer have been separated to permit formation of the C domain tetramer. Therefore, the connectivity between catalytic and C domains is unknown; the relationship implied by the colors illustrates one possibility. Like the class I model, both catalytic domain dimers are symmetrically disposed around the overall 2-fold axis (red diamond), although the C domains obey a higher 4-fold local symmetry. The essential features of the C domain interactions from the class I model are preserved: a dimer of dimers arrangement in which two of the four active sites participate in catalysis. A bottom view of the class II model (not shown) is similar to that in (b). As in the class I model, each viral cDNA is proposed to bind to two C domains, although the connectivity (a color pattern) cannot be determined. The possibility shown implies that each viral end might bind a dimer productively prior to tetramer formation.

ever, it seems sensible that, like the class I model, each viral cDNA end binds to two C domains. The intriguing possibility exists that binding of a cDNA end alters the conformation of the integrase dimer, making them competent for tetramer formation. Tetramerization in this manner could potentially also help to coordinate the formation of integrase complexes with completion of reverse transcription. As with our models, Heuer and Brown in crosslinking and modeling studies of HIV integrase also propose the presence of two kinds of protomers in the integration complex; those that participate in catalysis and those that do not. They suggest that integrase monomers not involved in covalent chemistry may nevertheless contribute much of the DNA binding in the complex, leading to a proposal that an octamer may be the active form (Heuer & Brown, 1998). Integration complexes in vivo likely involve further features not yet modeled. Several studies

have implicated distortion of both the viral cDNA and target DNA as important for integration, but the conformation of the distorted DNA is unclear (Bor et al., 1995; Bushman & Craigie, 1992; Katz et al., 1998; Muller & Varmus, 1994; Pruss et al., 1994a; Scottoline et al., 1997). The placement of the amino-terminal zinc-binding domains (absent in RSV IN 49-286) remains unknown, although for HIV, the N domain can cross-link to target DNA (Heuer & Brown, 1997). In our models, target DNA makes relatively few contacts with the other two integrase domains, so it is attractive to model the zinc-binding domain as binding to target DNA. The two-domain RSV integrase structure and inhibitor design The studies presented here provide new targets for design of potential antiretroviral drugs. Previous studies of isolated catalytic domains have provided views of the integrase active site, but in

supernatant was decanted after allowing the medium to settle. Resuspended medium with bound integrase was packed into a 25 mm diameter Â 100 mm glass column (Pharmacia, XK25) and washed with 150 ml of buffer A (buffer B lacking NaCl). Protein was eluted with a sharp linear gradient of 10 % - 100 % buffer B. Fractions containing integrase (eluting at about 0.5-1.0 M NaCl) were dialyzed against buffer C (50 mM Mes (pH 6.1), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 1.7 mM AEBSF, 10 mM MgSO4, 1 mM EDTA, 4  C) and loaded onto a 10 mm diameter, 100 mm long, POROS HS 20 column (PerSeptive Biosystems) and eluted with a linear gradient of 10-100 % buffer D (buffer C with 1.0 M NaCl). Fractions containing integrase were pooled, and ¯ash frozen for storage at À80  C after adding glycerol to 10 % (v/v). Preparation of selenomethionine-modified RSV IN 49-286 F199K Plasmid pBW25 encoding the F199K mutation was transformed into E. coli strain DL21 (DE3)pLysS and grown overnight in 50 ml of LeMaster's minimal medium (Yang et al., 1990) containing 50 mg/ml methionine, 50 mg/ml carbenicillin, and 35 mg/ml chloramphenicol at 32  C. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 10 l of fresh LeMaster's medium containing 50 mg/ml L-selenomethionine (Sigma), 50 mg/ml carbenicillin, and 35 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Following growth to A600  0.8 at 32  C, labeled-integrase was induced with IPTG for three hours at 32  C. Cells were harvested and protein was puri®ed as above, except that 20 mM DTT was added to all buffers to limit oxidation of selenium. Activity assays Assays of the activities of the RSV integrase fragments were carried out essentially as described (Bushman & Wang, 1994). Brie¯y, the terminal cleavage substrate consisted of two hybridized oligonucleotides, 5H -CTACAAGAGTATTGCATAAGACTACATT-3H (FB141) and its complement (FB142). The sequence matches that of the U3 end of the unintegrated RSV cDNA. The sequence of the dumbbell disintegration product is shown in Figure 2(a). Substrates (FB141 and the dumbbell disintegration substrate FB221) were 32P end-labeled. Assay mixtures contained 0.5 pmol of DNA substrate, 5 mM MnCl2 or MgCl2, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 40 mM NaCl, 20 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 % glycerol. Enzyme was added last to each assay. Reactions were incubated for one hour at 37  C, and were stopped by adding sequencing gel loading dye and heating brie¯y to 95  C. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 15 % polyacrylamide DNA-sequencing type gels and visualized by autoradiography. Crystallization of RSV IN 49-286 F199K The two-domain integrase mutants, dialyzed (25 mM Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 3 mM DTT, three hours, 4  C) and concentrated (15-20 mg/ml, Centriplus 10 K, Amicon), were tested for crystallization in hanging drop vapor diffusion sparse matrix screens (4  C and 21  C, Crystalscreen 1 and 2, and Natrix, Hampton Research, protein and reservoir mixed 1:1 (v/v) to give 2-4 ml drops). Small crystals of the F199 K form initially grew with Natrix condition #23 (0.2 M KCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.05 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 10 % (w/v) PEG 4000).

pre-integration complexes in vivo, the active site is expected to be bound to viral DNA. The new models provide candidate templates for designing inhibitors active against integrase-DNA complexes. Importantly, the new protein-protein interactions observed in the two-domain structure also provide new targets. For example, inhibitors might target the asymmetric interface between the C domains. At present, the degree of similarity between RSV and HIV is unclear, but the phylogenetic conservation of integrase proteins is impressive and inhibitors active against RSV integrase may often inhibit HIV integrase as well.

Materials and Methods
Construction of plasmids encoding derivatives of RSV integrase Mutant derivatives of RSV integrase were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of RSV were derived from the pATV8 clone from the Prague C strain (Katz et al., 1982). The starting plasmid pBW5 (Bushman & Wang, 1994), encoding amino acid residues 49-286 of RSV integrase, was fused to a His-Tag sequence supplied by the vector (pET15B, Novagen). To facilitate structural studies, the His-Tag sequence was removed by cloning the NdeI to PstI fragment into the pINSD1 (Engelman & Craigie, 1992) expression vector, yielding pBW22. To generate point mutations in the gene for RSV IN 49-286, the Excite Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used with appropriate mutagenic primers. In this way, point mutations A190K, L196K, and F199K were generated, to yield plasmids pBW31, pBW29, and pBW25, respectively. A deletion mutant encoding RSV IN residues 58286 was also constructed using the Excite Mutagenesis Kit. Sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides used are available upon request. All DNA constructions were analyzed and con®rmed by DNA sequencing. Purification of RSV IN 49-286 and derivatives Expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen), and grown in a fermentor (New Brunswick Scienti®c BioFlo 3000) containing 10 l of Luria broth (LB), 50 mg/ml carbenicillin (Gibco BRL), and 1 % (w/v) glucose. The cultures were grown at 37  C to a cell density of A600 $ 1.5, induced with 2 mM IPTG (United States Biochemical) for two hours, then harvested by centrifugation (Beckman JA10, 5000 g ) and frozen at À80  C, typically yielding $40 g of wet cell paste. Expression levels and identi®cation of the abundant integrase in column fractions were made by visual inspection of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. In a typical protein puri®cation, 40 g of cells was suspended in 250 ml of lysis buffer (buffer B; 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 M NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 1.7 mM 4-(2aminoethyl)benzensulfonylfonyl¯uoride, HCl (AEBSF), 10 mM MgSO4, 1 mM EDTA), sonicated (four to ®ve minutes on ice, 90 % duty cycle, output setting 9, Branson Soni®er 250), and centrifuged (100,000 g, Beckman Avanti J-30 I, 20 minutes, 4  C). The supernatant ¯uid was poured directly into a 60 ml slurry of SPStreamline cation-exchange medium (Pharmacia) and the salt concentration lowered about ®vefold by the slow addition, with mixing, of about 1 l of dilution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT). The diluted

546
Monoclinic (P21) crystals were produced by hanging drop vapor diffusion (reservoir solution: 0.05 M KCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.05 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), 10 % (w/v) PEG 3350, and 25 % (v/v) ethylene glycol). Triclinic (P1) crystals appeared infrequently in the same conditions. Monoclinic (P21) crystals of selenomethionineincorporated protein were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion under modifed native conditions with added imidazole (reservoir solution, 0.050 M KCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 0.02 M imidazole, 10 % PEG 3350, and 25 % ethylene glycol). The monoclinic P21 form contains one dimer in the asymmetric unit, whereas the triclinic P1 form has two. Structure determination of the monoclinic form Data from monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms were collected at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source station X9B using either a MAR345 image plate or ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. Data were processed using HKL (Denzo/Scalepack) software (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The triclinic cell has approximate C2 symmetry, but the data fail to index in the monoclinic cell. An interpretable experimentally phased electron density Ê map at 3.2 A resolution was obtained through MAD methods (SOLVE (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999)) using data from selenomethionine-modi®ed monoclinic crystals (Table 1). The catalytic domain was modeled using the structure of ASV integrase catalytic domain (PDB 1VSE) positioned by molecular replacement. The selenium positions superimposed on the methionine positions located in the molecular replacement solution, con®rming the solution. Initial MAD phases with a mean ®gure-of-merit of 0.46 were improved to 0.84 using density modi®cation procedures (program dm). The SH3like folds of the C domains were located visually in the MAD-phased maps. Monomeric models of C domains of HIV IN (PDB IIHV) were positioned manually, then modi®ed into the RSV sequence. The resulting model containing both catalytic and C domains was partially re®ned (X-PLOR, Brunger, 1992; SHELX, Sheldrick & Ê Schneider, 1997) to a standard R-factor of 30 % at 3.2 A resolution. Structure determination of the triclinic form The monoclinic dimer model was used in molecular replacement to solve for the high-resolution triclinic crystal form (four monomers per unit cell, R-factor 43 %, correlation coef®cient 48 % (AMoRe, Navaza & Saludjian, 1997). The triclinic structure was re®ned using standard XPLOR and CNS (Brunger, 1992; Brunger et al., 1998) protocols to a ®nal R-factor of 21.6 % (Table 1). The two dimers in the triclinic cell were restrained during re®nement by non-crystallographic symmetry corresponding to an approximate 180  rotation between dimers. Manual rebuilding of the model was accomplished using CHAIN (Sack & Quiocho, 1997). The ®nal triclinic structure comprises about 85 % of the sequence: the ®rst ®ve residues at the N termini and C-terminal 17 amino acid residues are partially or completely disordered. In addition, the loop structure near the active site (145-154) was visualized and constructed successfully in two of four independent monomers. Information from the triclinic structure was used to complete the monoclinic structure, which was further re®ned to an R factor of 25.6 %. Figures were prepared using programs MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997), Raster3D

Note added in proof
A recently published atomic resolution structure of a D64N mutant of the ASV catalytic domain shows an ordered loop conformation similar to that observed in the distal monomer of the triclinic two-domain form (Figure 4) (Lubkowski, J., Dauter, Z., Yang, F., Alexandratos, J., Merkel, G., Skalka, A. M. & Wlodawer, A. (1999). Biochemistry, 38, 13512-13522.). For example, residues 145-154 of RCSB Protein Data Bank model 1c9z (low pH Ê form) superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.39 A in main-chain atoms.
