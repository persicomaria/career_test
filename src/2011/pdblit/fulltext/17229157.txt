During anaerobic cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis, CbiL catalyzes methylation at the C-20 position of a cyclic tetrapyrrole ring using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl group source. This methylation is a key modification for the ring contraction process, by which a porphyrin-type tetrapyrrole ring is converted to a corrin ring through elimination of the modified C-20 and direct bonding of C-1 to C-19. We have determined the crystal structures of Chlorobium tepidum CbiL and CbiL in complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine (the S-demethyl form of S-adenosylmethionine). CbiL forms a dimer in the crystal, and each subunit consists of N-terminal and C-terminal domains. S-Adenosylhomocysteine binds to a cleft between the two domains, where it is specifically recognized by extensive hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. The orientation of the cobaltfactor II substrate was modeled by simulation, and the predicted model suggests that the hydroxy group of Tyr226 is located in close proximity to the C-20 atom as well as the C-1 and C-19 atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring. These configurations allow us to propose a catalytic mechanism: the conserved Tyr226 residue in CbiL catalyzes the direct transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the substrate through an SN2-like mechanism. Furthermore, the structural model of CbiL binding to its substrate suggests the axial residue coordinated to the central cobalt of cobalt-factor II.

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is one of the most structurally complex cofactors in nature. The cobalamin biosynthetic pathway is shared with heme, siroheme and (bacterio)chlorophyll until the generation of uroporphyrinogen III [1]. Thereafter, the pathway to cobalamin incorporates many features that are not observed in the biosynthesis of other cyclic tetrapyrroles: cobalamin contains a cobalt-centered corrin ring (a modified porphyrin-type tetrapyrrole ring) whose

biosynthesis requires more than 15 enzyme-mediated steps [2­5]. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated that there are at least two distinct routes for cobalamin biosynthesis, representing oxygen-dependent (aerobic) [6] and oxygen-independent (anaerobic) pathways [5]. The key difference between these pathways is the timing of cobalt insertion, which occurs earlier in the anaerobic pathway than in the aerobic pathway.

Crystal structure of the methyltransferase CbiL

K. Wada et al.

A unique feature of cobalamin biosynthesis is the attachment of eight methyl groups derived from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the tetrapyrrole framework during corrin construction. In particular, the methylation of the C-20 position is interesting: in subsequent steps, both the added methyl group and the substituted C-20 carbon are lost as acetaldehyde, and ring contraction occurs via bonding of C-1 to C-19 [7]. At this step, the porphyrin-type tetrapyrrole ring is converted to a corrin ring. Thus, the methylation of C-20 is a key modification for ring contraction. In the anaerobic pathway, the methyltransferase (MTase) CbiL is responsible for methylating the C-20 position of the tetrapyrrole ring: CbiL converts cobaltfactor II (cobalt-sirohydrochlorin) into cobalt-factor III using SAM as a methyl group source (Fig. 1). Genomic analysis of an obligate anaerobe, Chlorobium tepidum [8], has identified a gene cluster involved in cobalamin biosynthesis. The components of the C. tepidum gene cluster are similar to those of Salmonella typhimurium (Fig. 2A), a well-studied model system for the anaerobic biosynthesis of cobalamin. In the C. tepidum gene cluster, the CT0388 gene is annotated as CbiL, and shares 27.6% identity and 51.2% similarity with S. typhimurium CbiL (Fig. 2B). A combination of physicochemical experiments (MALDIMS, NMR, UV / visible spectrometry, IR spectrometry, and EPR) demonstrated that S. typhimurium CbiL has an absolute requirement for the presence of a central metal in the tetrapyrrole substrate [9]. Furthermore, CbiL is capable of distinguishing between the Co(II) and Ni(II) or Zn(II) forms of the substrate. However,

the mechanisms of CbiL-mediated methylation and substrate recognition remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the crystal structure of C. tepidum ° CbiL at 2.1 A resolution as well as the crystal structure of CbiL in complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), showing the detailed environment of the active site. Furthermore, we have modeled the binding mode of the cobalt-factor II substrate. On the basis of the spatial arrangement of CbiL residues around the bound SAH and cobalt-factor II, we propose a mechanism for substrate recognition and C-20 methylation.

Results and Discussion
Purification and estimation of the molecular mass of CbiL A C. tepidum CbiL­His6 fusion protein was overproduced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). SDS / PAGE of whole cell extracts showed a Coomassie Blue-stained band at around 28 kDa (not shown), consistent with the total estimated mass of the CbiL­His6 fusion protein based on the DNA sequence (27.6 kDa). One-step affinity purification produced nearly homogeneous CbiL. Gel filtration analysis indicated that CbiL forms a homodimer of 56 kDa; this molecular mass was independently confirmed by dynamic light scattering. The average yield of purified CbiL was about 9 mg from 5 g (wet weight) of bacterial cells, in a more than 95% pure form as judged by SDS / PAGE (not shown).

The folding of the ordered segments of subunits A and B was similar, except for the N-terminal and C-terminal segments (residues 1­6 and 239­246) (not shown); the ° rmsd was 0.49 A for the main-chain Ca atoms. Each subunit of CbiL consists of an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain (Fig. 3A,B), and there is no topological similarity between the two domains. The N-terminal domain consists of seven helices (a1­a4 and g1­ g3) and six b-strands (b1­b6). b-Strands 1, 2 and 4­6 form a parallel b-sheet. The C-terminal domain has a mixed b-sheet consisting of five b-strands (b7­b11) flanked by six helices (a5­a7 and g4­g6). The folding

reveals that CbiL belongs to the class III MTase family [10]. CbiL forms a dimer in the crystal (Fig. 3C), consistent with biochemical evidence. The subunits in the dimer are related by a noncrystallographic two-fold axis. The main contacts stabilizing the dimer involve the residues of the g1 and a1 helices in the N-terminal domain, and b6, a5 and b7 in the C-terminal domain.

arity between the surfaces (gap volume index) is 1.94; these are reasonable values for a dimer of a 25-kDa protein [11]. SAM/SAH-binding site The electron density of SAH was sufficiently clear that its conformation and orientation were explicitly determined (Fig. 4A). SAH is bound to the cleft between the

N-terminal and C-terminal domains of each subunit. SAH binds to Pro14, Asp106, Phe109, Ala135, and Val205, as well as to Val104 and Phe136 via a water molecule (Fig. 4B). Most of these residues are conserved among CbiL orthologs (Fig. 2B). In total, there are 11 hydrogen bonds between CbiL and SAH, which fix exactly the position and orientation of SAH. Notably, neither of the two hydroxy groups in the sugar moiety of SAH is involved in hydrogen bonding to CbiL.

The bound SAH is in the bent conformation and has an O4*­C4*­C5*­SD torsion angle of @80° (see Fig. 4B). Similar bent conformations of SAH have been previously reported in other class III MTases [10]. Figure 4C shows the superposition of the C. tepidum CbiL, Pseudomonas denitrificans S-adenosylmethionine-dependent uroporphyrinogen III C methyltransferase (SUMT) [12], and Bacillus megaterium CbiF [13] MTases, all of which are involved in cobalamin biosynthesis. Despite low sequence identity (14% identity between CbiL and SUMT, and 17% identity between CbiL and CbiF), the overall folds of these proteins are ° similar; rmsds are less than 1.48 A for the Ca atoms. However, notable differences are observed in the loops forming the upper side of the SAM / SAH-binding cleft (Fig. 4C). In CbiL, the upper wall of the cleft is extruded to deepen the cleft. In contrast, the corresponding regions in SUMT and CbiF form short loops. These structural differences may be reflected in the recognition of different substrates and different methylation positions: CbiL methylates the C-20 position of cobalt-factor II [9], SUMT methylates the C-2 and C-7 positions of uroporphyrinogen III [14], and CbiF methylates the C-11 position of preccorin-4 [15]. Substrate-binding model of CbiL suggests the residue axially coordinated to cobalt-factor II The large cleft between the two domains of CbiL is large enough to hold the cobalt-factor II substrate (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the bound SAH is located on the inner surface of the cavity, strongly suggesting that cobalt-factor II binds to this cleft. To examine substrate binding to the cleft, we computationally modeled CbiL in complex with cobalt-factor II. Because CbiL methylates the C-20 position of cobalt-factor II using SAM, the C-20 position of cobalt-factor II must lie near the sulfur atom of SAH. Therefore, we manually placed a model of cobalt-factor II into the cleft in such a way that its location and orientation relative to SAH were suitable for the methyl transfer reaction. This model was then subjected to energy minimization. This procedure produced a model of CbiL in complex with cobalt-factor II in which there is no steric hindrance between the two molecules (Fig. 5B). No marked change in the structure of CbiL in complex with SAH was observed after the energy minimization. The model of CbiL in complex with cobalt-factor II suggests two possible functional groups that may bind to the central metal of cobalt-factor II. The cobalt ° may be positioned in close proximity (@2.3 A) to the hydroxy group of Thr112; however, to the best of our knowledge, a threonine side chain functioning as a
568

ligand of the central metal in a cyclic tetrapyrrole is unprecedented. The second possibility is the sulfur atom of Met71; however, a structural change would be needed for this to coordinate to the cobalt, as this sulfur atom is located far from the cobalt in the model ° (@7 A). Indeed, Met71 mobility was suggested by its B-factor and translation / libration / screw (TLS) motion. That is, in the CbiL­SAH complex, Met71 is located in a loop that forms the upper wall of the cleft, as des° cribed above, and has the highest B-factor (40­50 A2), indicating structural flexibility (Fig. 5C). Indeed, most of this flexible loop is disordered in the CbiL­SAH complex. In addition, the TLS motion determination server employed in the structure refinement indicated a pincer-like mobility between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Fig. 5D). Thus, it is likely that a conformational change occurs upon substrate binding: CbiL would accept cobalt-factor II with an accompanying induced fit. Intriguingly, a phylogenetic alignment of CbiL ortholog sequences (89 organisms) showed that Met71 is conserved in CbiL and putative CbiL proteins involved in the anaerobic cobalamin biosynthetic pathway. In contrast, CobI and putative CobI proteins, which catalyze the analogous step in the aerobic cobalamin biosynthetic pathway, do not possess this methionine (not shown). This limited conservation is consistent with the characteristics of CbiL: CbiL exhibits an absolute requirement for the presence of a central metal [9], whereas CobI does not require a central metal for the reaction [6]. Taken together, Met71 is most likely the ligand for the cobalt atom in cobaltfactor II. Additional studies, including site-directed mutagenesis on CbiL in complex with cobalt-factor II, are needed to verify whether the cobalt within the substrate is in pentacoordinate or hexacoordinate geometry. Implications for the reaction mechanism The model of CbiL in complex with cobalt-factor II also suggests the catalytic residue: notably, the hydroxy group of Tyr226 may be located in close proximity to the C-20 atom in the tetrapyrrole ring (Og-Tyr226 to ° C-20 @3.0 A) as well as to the C-1 and C-19 atoms ° ) (Fig. 5B). Additionally, the methyl carbon (@3.7 A atom of SAM is predicted to lie an estimated distance ° of @2.8 A from the C-20 atom; this is close enough for the methyl group to be transferred to the C-20 atom. These configurations strongly suggest that Tyr226 is the nucleophilic proton acceptor in the reaction. Interestingly, a similar configuration of a tyrosine residue was recently reported in the MTase BchU, which is involved in photosynthetic pigment biosynthe-

sis [16]. Although the overall structures of BchU and CbiL are quite different, the following similarities are found: (a) both enzymes utilize SAM as a methyl group donor; (b) both enzymes have tetrapyrrole substrates (cobalt-factor II for CbiL, and Mg-bacteriochlorophyllide d for BchU [9,17,18]); (c) both enzymes exhibit an absolute requirement for the presence of a

central metal in the substrate [9,18]; and (d) both enzymes methylate the C-20 position of the tetrapyrrole ring. Structural and mutational studies of BchU demonstrated that an invariant tyrosine (Tyr246) located near the C-19 position of the tetrapyrrole ring acts as the nucleophile in the methylation reaction [16]. In CbiL and its orthologs, the PYFS sequence

including Tyr226 is strictly conserved (Fig. 2B), and three of these four residues (YFS) form a tight turn (c-turn). This tight turn enables the side chain of Tyr226 to protrude into the substrate-binding site. Thus, the similarities between CbiL and BchU, together with the conservation of Tyr226 among CbiL orthologs, allow us to propose a mechanism for CbiL methylation. The invariant Tyr226 in CbiL catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from SAM to the substrate through an SN2-like mechanism [19]: SAM­S­CH3 + C20­ H + HO/O)­Tyr226 fi SAH + CH3­C20 + H2O+/HO­ Tyr226.

reservoir solution [15% (w / v) poly(ethylene glycol) 3350, 200 mm ammonium nitrate]. Iodide derivative crystals were prepared by soaking the native crystals in 0.5 m KI solution for a few seconds. CbiL crystals in complex with SAH were obtained by soaking the native crystals in a reservoir supplemented with 1 mm SAH for several minutes. The crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solution containing 15% (v / v) glycerol and flash-cooled under a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected with a Quantum 315 detector (ADSC, Poway, CA, USA) at the BL41XU station at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The intensity data were processed and scaled with the program hkl2000 [20]. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1.

Experimental procedures
Subcloning of the cbiL gene into an expression vector
The cbiL gene was amplified from the genome of C. tepidum strain WT2321 by PCR using forward primer 5¢-CAT ATGAACAATCAAGGCTCGATC-3¢ and reverse primer 5¢-AAGCTTTGACGCAAAGGGCGAAAGG-3¢. The PCR product was initially subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the sequence was confirmed. Following the digestion of pCR2.1-TOPO-cbiL with NdeI and HindIII, the DNA fragment containing the cbiL gene was ligated into the pET21a(+) vector (Novagen, EMD Bioscience Inc., Madison, WI, USA), and pET21a(+)-cbiL-His6 was subsequently generated.

Structure determination and refinement
We initiated structure determination by the molecular replacement (MR) method using molrep [21], in which the structure of CbiF (Protein Data Bank entry 2CBF) was used as a search model. Although the initial electron density map was improved by applying the automatic rebuilding procedure in resolve [22], a large part of the resulting map remained uninterpretable. Thus, we applied the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) ° method using the KI-derivative data collected at 1.50 A as a complement to the MR method. A Bijvoet difference ° Fourier map of the KI-derivative crystal at 3.1 A resolution calculated on the basis of the phase angles derived from the MR model showed three iodide sites. The SAD phase angles derived from these iodide sites (phasing power ¼0.58) were improved by combination of the phase information from the MR method using the Hendrickson­Lattman coefficients and by solvent flattening using cns [23]. The resulting electron density map was interpretable; a partial model including the side chains was constructed automatically using arp / warp [24] and lafire [25]. The model was improved by alternating rounds of refinement using cns and model building using xtalview / xfit [26] until the Rfree value was reduced to 30%. At this stage, TLS refinement [27] using refmac5 [28] was applied to the model with four TLS groups in each subunit defined by the TLS motion determination server. The refinement of CbiL in complex with SAH was started with the native CbiL coordinates. Iterative cycles of model refinement were performed using lafire and refmac5 with TLS refinement. Finally, SAH molecules were incorporated manually with xtalview / xfit. The results of structural refinement are summarized in Table 1. The coordinates and structure factors for the CbiL and CbiL­SAH structures have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2E0K and 2E0N, respectively. Secondary structure in the models was assigned using promotif [29], and the geometry of the final models was

Purification of His-tagged CbiL
The pET21a(+)-cbiL-His6 expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The C-terminal His-tagged CbiL protein was purified using Ni­nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After the CbiL­His6 was eluted from the resin, it was further purified by gel filtration using a HiPrep 16 / 60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column equipped with ¨ the AKTA explorer 10S system (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Fractions containing CbiL were monitored by absorption at 280 nm and SDS / PAGE analysis. Purified protein was concentrated to 10 mgÆmL)1 using Vivaspin (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) for crystallization.

Crystallization and data collection
Crystallization was performed with the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. CbiL crystals were grown in drops containing a 1 : 1 mixture of protein solution [5 mgÆmL)1 in 50 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.8) and 150 mm NaCl] and

For modeling of CbiL in complex with cobalt-factor II, the coordinates of cobalt-factor II were generated by corina [32], and the topologies and parameters for cobalt-factor II were generated by xplo2d [33]. Cobalt-precorrin II was manually appended to the cavity in the crystal structure of CbiL in complex with SAH, and this model was then subjected to energy minimization (200 cycles) using cns (model_minimize.inp). In this energy minimization step, the conformations of the starting model, including protein moiety and SAH and cobalt-factor II, were allowed to be changed.
