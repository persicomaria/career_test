The investigation of common structural motifs provides additional information on why proteins conserve similar topologies yet may have non-conserved amino acid sequences. Proteins containing the ubiquitin superfold have similar topologies, although the sequence conservation is rather poor. Here, we present novel similarities and differences between the proteins ubiquitin and NEDD8. They have 57% identical sequence, almost identical backbone topology and similar functional strategy, although their physiological functions are mutually different. Using variable pressure NMR spectroscopy, we found that the two proteins have similar conformational fluctuation in the evolutionary conserved enzyme-binding region and contain a structurally similar locally disordered conformer (I) in equilibrium with the basic folded conformer (N). A notable difference between the two proteins is that the equilibrium population of I is far greater for NEDD8 (G0NI < 5 kJ/mol) than for ubiquitin (G0NI = 15.2 (±1.0) kJ/mol), and that the tendency for overall unfolding (U) is also far higher for NEDD8 (G 0 NU = 11.0(±1.5) kJ/mol) than for ubiquitin (G 0 NU = 31.3(±4.7) kJ/mol). These results suggest that the marked differences in thermodynamic stabilities of the locally disordered conformer (I) and the overall unfolding species (U) are a key to determine the functional differences of the two structurally similar proteins in physiology.

Evolutionally Conserved Intermediates

Introduction
The ubiquitin-fold1 is common for ubiquitin-like proteins and for many domains of larger proteins, although sequence conservation for the proteins is rather poor and their physiological functions are different. This goes against the classical view that a protein folds into a single specific structure to perform a specific function. Recently, many experiments have shown that a protein exists in an ensemble of different structures2,3 and it is considered that, to function, a protein exploits conformational transitions in a wide conformational space beyond the lowest energy folded structure.4­10 Ubiquitin as a post-translational modifier targets many proteins for digestion in the 26 S proteosome as well as for altering function and location or for trafficking of its binding partners. The protein NEDD811­14 is a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL), consisting of 81 amino acid residues and sharing 57% amino acid sequence identity with ubiquitin. NEDD8 is also a post-translational modifier and is essential for cellular regulatory mechanisms including cell division and signal transduction. 15, 16 NEDD8 is conjugated to the target proteins, in which so far cullin family members of ubiquitin ligases are known.15,17 The reaction chemistry is quite similar in both proteins such that the Cterminal carboxylate forms an isopeptide bond with a lysyl residue of the target protein aided by a series of enzymes.18 Although the two modifier proteins have much similarity in their chemistry and functional strategy, they play different roles in cellular physiology. Despite their different roles in the cell, the basic folded structures of the two proteins are almost identical (R.M.S.D. of the main chain atoms between the two proteins: 0.6 Å). The structure of the complex of NEDD8 with the E1 enzyme, as determined by X-ray crystallography,19,20 depicts significant conformational changes in both NEDD8 and the E1 enzyme upon the complex formation; the C-terminal tail (beyond Leu69) of NEDD8 is reoriented by about 30°, while the E1 also undergoes a conformational change for NEDD8 binding. Although no detailed structure is available for ubiquitin­E1 complex, NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments suggest that ubiquitin binds to E1 in a similar manner.21 Furthermore, our previous high pressure NMR studies indicate that ubiquitin fluctuates to cause local unfolding in the enzymebinding region.8,22,23 These results appear to indicate that the enzyme-binding regions of NEDD8 and ubiquitin are made intrinsically labile in order to facilitate their binding to respective E1s. Here, we examine the dynamics of NEDD8 in detail using spin relaxation and variable-pressure NMR spectroscopy, and compare the results with those previously published for ubiquitin. While spin relaxation is useful for delineating rapid and smallamplitude fluctuations, e.g. within the folded protein, variable-pressure NMR spectroscopy is

useful for exploring protein dynamics in a wide conformational space and detecting slow and largeamplitude fluctuations. 24­27 Furthermore, the method allows one to examine directly the structures of high-energy alternative conformers resulting from such fluctuations. Here we focus on the dynamics and high-energy alternative states of NEDD8 and ubiquitin to find the molecular origin for the functional similarity and differences between the two similarly folded proteins.

Results and Discussion
Large-amplitude fluctuations are found within the folded manifold of both NEDD8 and ubiquitin First, we investigated the backbone dynamics of N-uniformly labeled NEDD8 at 1 bar and 30 °C using 15N spin relaxation for individual amide groups. 15N/1H two-dimensional NMR measurements were performed at the 1H frequency of 800.16 MHz. The relaxation parameters, i.e. the longitudinal relaxation rate R1, the transverse relaxation rate R2 and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), are shown in Figure 1(a)­(c). The modelfree analysis of Lipari & Szabo28,29 gives the order parameters S2 representing the degree of spatial restriction of individual N-H vectors against motions in the picoseconds to nanoseconds range (Figure 1(d)) and the Rex representing the exchange contribution to R2 (Figure 1(e)). The S2 values for residues from 1 to 72 are mostly in the range 0.8­ 1.0, showing that the basic structure of NEDD8 is well folded. A decrease in the S2 values for residues beyond 72 shows increased motions of picoseconds to nanoseconds range toward the Cterminal end. The smaller S2 values for residues 73­76 are found commonly in the NEDD8 and ubiquitin, indicating that both proteins have similar fluctuations in the C-terminal segment, which carries a reactive C-terminal glycine. The R2 values (10­20 Hz) larger than average (7 Hz) were found for residues 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42, 68, 70 and 72, and the R2 values smaller than average were found for residues 73­76. The larger R2 values resulting in larger Rex values are considered to arise from slow fluctuations between (or among) different local conformations on the microsecond to millisecond timescale. In order to compare the slow conformational fluctuations between NEDD8 and ubiquitin, their R2 values are plotted in Figure 2(a) and (b). While the larger R2 values are obtained for all residues between residues 33 and 42 except the two proline residues at 37 and 38 and residues 68­72 in NEDD8 at 1 bar (Figure 2(a)), the corresponding R2 values for ubiquitin at 30 bar (filled circle in Figure 2(b)) show no such large R2 values, though smaller R2 values are depicted commonly for residues 73­76 in both proteins. When pressure is increased to 3 kbar, larger R2 values (10­18 Hz) are found for several

these residues increase at high pressure in ubiquitin, although they are less evident at low pressure (1 and 30 bar).

Severe line broadening prohibited quantitative evaluation of R2 values for residues 36 and 70 of NEDD8 and for residue 36 of ubiquitin at 3 kbar, but predict the values to be more than 22 Hz. The residues showing larger R2 values are colored purple (residues 33­42, 68, 70 and 72 for NEDD8, residues 33­42 and 70 for ubiquitin) and showing smaller R2 values are colored white (residues 73­76 for both NEDD8 and ubiquitin).

The residues showing rapid decrease of the cross-peak volumes with increasing pressure are colored red (see Figure 3). Blank means no data available due to signal overlap, lack of assignment or proline residues. Locations of the secondary structural elements are shown for -helices (lines) and -strands (arrows) at the top of the Figure. Types of the amino acids are shown at the bottom of each panel. The red residues are conserved amino acid sequences between human NEDD8 and human ubiquitin.

A large amplitude fluctuation has been characterized for ubiquitin involving the swinging of the -helix in and out by >3 Å with a simultaneous reorientation of the C­terminal segment at a frequency of 106 s-1 at 30 bar and 20 °C (PDB code: 1V80 for the basic native conformer and 1V81 for the alternatively folded conformer).8 Although a quantitative analysis could not be performed for NEDD8 due to the diminishment of cross-peaks from folded conformers at high pressure, the data

shown in Figure 2(a) and (b) strongly suggest that a similar conformational fluctuation takes place in NEDD8 as in ubiquitin, involving displacements of segments with residues 33­42, 68, 70 and 72. These conformational fluctuations are considered to occur within the folded manifold on the microsecond to millisecond timescale, and the secondary conformation occupies greater space than that of the crystal structure, as depicted in Figure 5(a) with coloring on the crystal structure of NEDD8.

Peculiar locally disordered conformers are found for NEDD8 and ubiquitin The highly fluctuating nature of the conformations beyond the range of the folded manifold is a common strategy for many functional proteins. Such conformations can be studied in detail using the variable-pressure multi-dimensional NMR technique.24­27 1H one-dimensional and 15N/1H twodimensional NMR measurements were performed at the 1 H frequency of 800.16 MHz for 15 Nuniformly labeled NEDD8 at various pressures between 30 bar and 2 kbar at 30 °C. The 1H one-dimensional spectrum of NEDD8 (data not shown) indicates that its polypeptide chain is well folded at 30 °C with several highfield shifted methyl signals showing the presence of a hydrophobic core. With increasing pressure, intensities of the methyl proton signals (e.g. well separated signal of Ile61 CH3 at 0.35 ppm) decrease, indicating the collapse of the hydrophobic core. Further details of the conformational transition of NEDD8 are obtained from 15N/1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of NEDD8 at different pressures at 30 °C (Figure 3 lower). Below 1 kbar, most cross-peaks show reversible chemical shift changes at all amide sites without significant broadening or changes in their intensities, indicating that the protein fluctuates largely within its folded conformation. However, the cross-peak intensities of residues 36, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 70, and then residues 35 and 68, are preferentially reduced with increasing pressure and became almost null before reaching 1.5 kbar, as shown in Figure 4(a). One should note that residues 37 and 38 are proline residues, giving no 15N/1H HSQC cross-

peaks. Cross-peak volumes for individual residues in the 15N/1H HSQC spectra of NEDD8 at 1 kbar are plotted in Figure 2(e), each normalized to the volume at 30 bar. Concomitantly, several new cross-peaks appear in the region corresponding to a typical unfolded polypeptide chain (8­8.6 ppm for most 1H signals, Figure 3 lower). This indicates that with increasing pressure local disordering takes place involving the above residues and that the locally disordered conformers (hereafter designated by I) are in slow exchange in the NMR time scale with the folded conformer (designated by N), that is, N  I. Because two separate signals are observed for the same residues, the fluctuations are slow (>> milliseconds). The population of the locally disordered conformer is undetectably small at 1 bar, but becomes detectable at high pressure, because of its intrinsic lower volume. Although it is a minor contribution to the population in equilibrium with the stable folded conformer N under physiological conditions, the presence of this peculiar conformer could be important for the function of NEDD8. The peculiar set of conformers I shows disorder preferentially at residues 34­42, 68 and 70, which are located from the end of the -helix (residues 23­34) to the beginning of the 3-strand (residues 40­45) and at the C-terminal 5-strand (residues 66­72), all of which are in close mutual proximity forming the C-terminal side of the protein. Note that we have no direct NMR evidence for the disorder of P37 and P38, as we have not signals from them, but we consider it likely that the entire segment, residues 33­42, is disordered, rather than that the two separate segments, residues 33­36 and 39­42, are independently disordered. The structure of the locally disordered conformer (qualitatively depicted in Figure 5(b)) is similar to the locally disordered

Figure 4. Plots of the volumes (normalized to those at 30 bar) of all the observable cross-peaks of the folded conformer N in the 1H/15N HSQC spectra of NEDD8 at 30 °C (a) and of ubiquitin at 0 °C23 (b) against pressure. At each pressure, corrections are made for the cross-peak intensities for an increase in the effective protein concentration by the pressure-induced compaction of the solvent water (for example, 7% by 2 kbar). The fractions of conformers I and U can be evaluated at individual residue sites at each pressure from cross-peak volumes using equation (1), from which equilibrium constants K and the Gibbs energy differences G can be evaluated as a function of pressure using equation (2). The G0 and V0 values were then calculated by fitting the pressure dependence of G against pressure according to equation (2). By extrapolating G to 1 bar using equation (2), we obtain standard Gibbs energy changes G0 from N to I or U. The unfolding transition curves are classified into two groups: one is a rapidly decaying minor group (red), and the other is a slowly decaying major group (black). The average of the slowly decaying group goes nearly parallel with the intensity of the 1H NMR signal at 0.35 ppm originating from Ile61 CH3 in the protein interior (Figure 3 filled circles), so that the integral intensity of the methyl peak is employed as a good measure of the population of the totally unfolded conformer U. In the case of ubiquitin (b), the rapidly decaying minor group goes almost in the same manner against pressure, except for the residue 36. Thus, the difference between the slowly and rapidly decaying fractions, averaged over the relevant cross-peaks (red spheres), represents the fraction of I, and the rest represents the fraction of the folded conformers. However, in the case of NEDD8 (a), the locally unfolded conformer I is apparently heterogeneous so that we can only evaluate some averages of stabilities, shown by the red dots (averaged values among 35, 40 and 68). The NEDD8 thermodynamic parameters determined are summarized in Table 1 in comparison with those obtained previously for ubiquitin at 0 °C and pH 4.5.

conformer of the folding intermediate (I) of ubiquitin reported previously23 (Figures 2(d) and 4(b)). It is quite intriguing to find that the residues undergoing local disordering are mostly conserved between NEDD8 and ubiquitin (Figure 2(c) and (d)) and almost coincide with the residues involved in the E1 enzyme-binding20 (Figure 5(c)). The finding appears to indicate that the peculiar local disorder is a common functional strategy of the two proteins for facilitating specific binding with the E1 enzymes. To examine whether the peculiar disorder found for both NEDD8 and ubiquitin is common to other UBLs, we have chosen the N-terminal UBL domain of parkin, which shares 32% sequence identity with ubiquitin, but does not act as a post-translational modifier like NEDD8 and ubiquitin (actually acts as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase).30 Using 15N spin relaxation and variable pressure NMR techniques, we found that the N-terminal UBL domain of parkin does not show an intermediate conformer with the peculiar local disorder, but undergoes a simple twostate transition with total unfolding (data not shown). This finding indicates that proteins with similar folds (at 1 bar) do not necessarily have similarly disordered intermediates. Furthermore, it strengthens the view that the peculiar local disorders found for NEDD8 and ubiquitin are evolutionally designs for post-translational modifiers like ubiquitin and NEDD8 to facilitate their binding with E1s. Above 1 kbar, all cross-peaks decrease in concerted manner (Figure 4(a)), showing the onset of global unfolding to the conformer U. The concerted transition of the cross-peaks goes nearly parallel with the change in intensity of the side-chain methyl signals at 0.35 ppm (filled circles in Figure 4(a)). During the change, the total cross-peak intensity of the 15N/1H HSQC spectra remains nearly constant with pressure, indicating that the conformational change is essentially reversible, allowing thermodynamic analysis of the experimental data of Figure 4(a) according to equations (1) and (2). Thermodynamic behavior is markedly different for NEDD8 and ubiquitin Although the conformational fluctuations and the structures of conformer I produced by the fluctuation are quite similar in the two proteins, the thermodynamic stabilities of the two proteins are quite different, as is immediately apparent in Figures 3 and 4. Stabilities of I and U were analyzed according to equations (1) and (2) (see Materials and Methods). In the case of NEDD8, the structure of the locally disordered conformer I is quite heterogeneous, allowing the evaluation of the average stability of I. From the red dots in Figure 4(a), the G0 of I is 5 kJ/mol with respect to N. The integral intensity of the Ile61 CH3 peak at 0.35 ppm (see Figure 4(a)) was employed as a measure of the population of the totally unfolded conformer U, giving a G0 of 11.0(±1.5) kJ/mol and a V0 of -70(±9) ml/mol, respectively, at 1 bar and 30 °C

Residues in NEDD8 contacting the E1 are shown in red (residues 8­10, 28­42 and 68­76).

for the transition from N to U. Urea-induced unfolding was conducted in a separate experiment, and G0 was 9.0(±1.5) kJ/mol at 30 °C and pH 6.0 for the transition from N to U (data not shown), in reasonable agreement with the one determined above. The thermodynamic parameters are summarized in Table 1 in comparison with those obtained previously for ubiquitin at 0 °C and pH 4.5. Figure 6 depicts Gibbs free energy diagrams for NEDD8 and ubiquitin. It is clear that the thermodynamic stabilities of I and U are far smaller for NEDD8 (G0 5 kJ/mol and 11 kJ/mol) than those for ubiquitin (G0 = 15.2 kJ/mol and 31.3 kJ/mol), despite the high degree of similarity in structures. One should note that the stabilities of I and U have been compared under different conditions for the two proteins. Because the conformational stability of ubiquitin is slightly lower at pH 4.5 than at pH 6.0 and considerably lower at 0 °C than at 30 °C,31,32 the stability differences would be even greater if the parameters were compared under the same condition, e.g. at pH 6.0 and at 30 °C. We speculate that the markedly different populations of I and U of the two proteins will cause different dynamic profiles of the proteins in physiolTable 1.

ogy, such as reactivity and degradability. Indeed, the degradation of NEDD8 by proteases (e.g. chymotrypsin and trypsin) occurs much more readily than that of ubiquitin (Figure 7). The acceleration of enzymatic degradation for NEDD8 would be explained by the substantially (more than four orders of magnitude) higher equilibrium concentration of the U conformer in NEDD8. Likewise, the markedly ( two orders of magnitude) higher population of I may make NEDD8 much more readily reactive than ubiquitin, although this speculation should be proven with careful experiments (e.g. in vivo experiments, mutagenesis experiments).

Conclusion
Comparative studies of NEDD8 and ubiquitin show that the two proteins have common structures not only in their basic folded states, but also in their high-energy states. On the other hand, the free

Variable pressure NMR experiments The 1H, 15N and 13C resonances of the backbone resonances were assigned using a standard set of double and triple resonance experiments by Bruker Biospin DMX 500 spectrometer with the Cryo-probe system (Bruker Biospin). Spectral assignments of NEDD8 will be reported elsewhere. Variable-pressure NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Biospin DRX 800 spectrometer combined with the on-line high pressure NMR cell technique reported by Yamada et al.33 The details of the pressure-resistive NMR cell are described in the literature.27,33 The proton NMR spectra were measured with watersuppression of a 3-9-19 pulsed field gradient at a proton frequency of 800.16 MHz. The 15N/1H HSQC spectra were measured with a sensitivity enhancement HSQC sequence34 combined with a water flip-back technique at a proton frequency of 800.16 MHz and a 15N frequency of 81.08 MHz. The 15N dimension was acquired with 128 increments and for the proton dimension 2048 complex points were collected with an offset at the residual water signal. At all pressures, 1H chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl 1H signal of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5sulfonate (DSS) and 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to DSS (0 ppm for 1H).35 The data were processed with the XWIN-NMR package (Bruker Biospin), nmrPipe and NMRview.36 The time-domain signals were zero-filled to give a final matrix of 2 k × 256 data points and apodized with a 90° shifted sine-bell window function in both dimensions. Thermodynamic analysis Under physiological conditions at 1 bar, the protein is nearly fully folded, the individual NMR signal intensity I0i represents that of the fully folded conformer N at individual site i. As the pressure is increased, either the local or the cooperative unfolding takes place, the original signal intensity I0i for N at site i decreases to Ii. Then the decrease in the intensity, I0­Ii, divided by the intensity Ii represents the equilibrium constant ([U]/[N])i at site i. Namely: Ki ¼ ð½U=½NÞi ¼ ðI0 À Ii Þ=Ii ð1Þ

energy levels for these high-energy conformers I and U are quite different between the two proteins, making the I and U states much more populated in NEDD8 than in ubiquitin under closely physiological conditions. These findings suggest that the energy landscapes for folding are quite different in depth for the two proteins, but similar in shape because the structures of the intermediate conformers I are similar. The authors speculate that conformer I is the putative reactive species for enzyme binding and that the marked differences in stabilities of I and U could be the cause for the functional differences of the two proteins in physiology. Thermally accessible higher energy conformers have been found in a number of proteins with a variety of thermodynamic stabilities.4,5,7­10 The examples of NEDD8/ubiquitin along with the Nterminal UBL domain of parkin show that the structures of the higher-energy conformers and their free energy levels are delicately designed for individual proteins. These higher-energy conformers are generally more reactive and appear to be structurally more directly oriented to function than their stable counterparts, namely the basic folded conformers. These observations lead us to suggest that the free energy levels as well as the structures of higher-energy conformers are crucial factors for controlling protein function. So far, the higherenergy conformers of proteins remain largely unexplored, the study of which could be a major subject of interest in future protein science.

In actual applications, Ii may represent individual crosspeak intensities in the two-dimensional HSQC spectra or the integral intensity of a well-separated signal in the onedimensional 1H NMR spectra. On the other hand, the Gibbs energy difference between any two conformers is expressed as a function of pressure p by equation (2) under the assumption of no compressibility change upon unfolding: DGp ¼ ÀRT lnK ¼ DG0 þ DV 0 ðp À p0 Þ ð2Þ

Here R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, K is the observed equilibrium constant, and Gp and G0 are the Gibbs free energy differences at pressure p and p0 (=1 bar), respectively. V0 is the partial molar volume difference between the two conformers at pressure p0 (=1 bar).
