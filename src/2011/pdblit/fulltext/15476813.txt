Integrins are one of the major families of cell-adhesion receptors. In the past year, the first structure of an integrin has been published, ligand-binding pockets have been defined, and mechanisms of receptor priming and activation elucidated. Like all major advances, however, these studies have raised more questions than they have answered about issues such as the mechanisms underlying ligand-binding specificity and long-range conformational regulation. Integrins function as transmembrane switches that dynamically link the contractile actin-microfilament system with the deformable meshwork of the extracellular matrix [1­ 3]. By coupling the functions of these two complex macromolecular assemblies, integrins direct membrane protrusion to adhesive extracellular sites and enable cells to apply contractile force to their surroundings. In turn, cell ­ matrix contact induces a congregation of signalling adaptors and enzymes that is manifested as specialized morphological structures such as focal adhesions. The integrin ­ cytoskeletal junction can therefore be considered as an assembly template that imposes a spatial control on signalling events. The dynamic nature of integrin function ­ by which cells use adhesion to continuously sample their pericellular environment and respond accordingly, in terms of changing their position and differentiated state ­ demands a highly responsive receptor structure. Until a year ago, little was known about the structural features that enable integrins to interconvert between inactive/non-adhesive and active/adhesive forms. In addition, the molecular basis of ligand recognition, intramolecular signal propagation and cytoplasmic domain­ effector coupling were unknown. However, in the past 12 months, the full weight of contemporary structure determination technology [including X-ray crystallography, NMR and electron microscopy (EM)] has been thrown at these problems, and major advances have been made.

Structure of the integrin extracellular domain, with and without ligand Integrins are heterodimeric receptors comprising unrelated a and b subunits. In mammals, 18 a and eight b subunits assemble to form 24 different receptors, named according to their subunit composition (e.g. a4b1). The modular structure of the extracellular domains of the two types of subunit is identical, except that nine a subunits contain an , 200-amino-acid insert that is homologous to the A domain of von Willebrand factor [4]. The presence of this module endows a different mode for ligand binding and activation and, therefore, it should be considered that integrins form two subclasses. All integrins bind their ligands in a divalent cation-dependent manner with manganese and magnesium generally promoting binding, and calcium having the opposite effect. In 2001 the first X-ray crystal structure of the extracellular domain of an integrin was published [5]. The integrin concerned was aVb3, a receptor implicated in cardiovascular and bone function that recognizes glycoprotein ligands such as vitronectin and fibronectin. The overall shape of the integrin is that of a globular `head' supported by two rod-like `legs' (Fig. 1). The major contact between the two subunits is in the head region, in which a seven-bladed b-propeller fold in the a subunit complexes with a von Willebrand factor A domain in the b subunit (termed the bA domain to distinguish it from the aA domain). The A-domain fold is a hydrophobic b sheet that is sandwiched by two sets of amphipathic a helices. Although aVb3 is a member of the subclass of integrins that lacks an aA domain, its structure also predicted the aA-domain insertion site to be within a loop on the surface of the b propeller that faces the b subunit (Fig. 1). The a-subunit leg of the integrin contains three large b-sandwich domains. Between the `thigh' domain and the first of two `calf ' domains is a highly flexible `knee' (or `genu'), which adopts a striking , 1358 bend in the crystal structure. The b-subunit leg contains a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, an immunoglobulin fold termed the hybrid domain, four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and a novel cystatin-like fold. The b-subunit knee region ­ which is formed from the conjunction of the hybrid domain, two EGF repeats and

A second integrin crystal structure followed closely after the first, in which a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligand peptide was soaked in the presence of manganese into pre-existing crystals [6]. Two additional cation-binding sites were observed in this structure, both of which were located in the bA domain. The location of the ligand-binding pocket was found to be at the junction of the b propeller and the bA domain in the integrin head (Figs 1,2a).

The publication of the aVb3 crystal structures has enabled 15 years of chemical analyses and structure predictions for proteins to be put into context [4,7 ­10], but it also raised many questions. Here, we review the extent to which the structural basis of integrin function is now understood, and we identify some key questions that remain. What determines ligand-binding specificity? Although the crystal structure of aVb3 provided the first view of an integrin dimer, major insights have also been

obtained from a series of crystallographic studies of the isolated aA domain, two of which have focused on complexes with ligands [11,12]. Taking the three published integrin ­ ligand complex structures together, several common features are apparent. In each case, the major ligand-binding event is the formation of a ligand carboxyldivalent cation coordination complex in a pocket at the top of an A domain (Fig. 2). In the case of the collagen ­ a2Adomain and ICAM-1­ aLA-domain complexes, the carboxyl is provided by a glutamate residue, whereas for the RGD peptide ­ aVb3 complex, it is provided by an aspartate residue. The cation-binding site has been termed MIDAS, for `metal ion-dependent adhesion site'. The elucidation of this conserved mode of ligand binding is an enormous advance because it explains the cation dependence of ligand binding (and cell adhesion), the use of short acidic-peptide motifs [including Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) as well as RGD] by all characterized integrin ligands, the propensity of a given integrin to bind to multiple ligands and, conversely, the ability of a given ligand to be recognized by multiple integrins. Nonetheless, two important questions remain unanswered. What are the full determinants of ligand-binding specificity? It is easy to imagine how complementary conformations of ligand acidic motifs and receptor cation-binding pockets might determine the specificity of receptor­ ligand binding, indeed receptor-specific conformations of RGD have been engineered chemically, but there is also evidence that integrin ligands contain accessory or `synergy' sites for receptor binding. Fibronectin is the best characterized ligand in this regard, and its synergy site ­ which is located in the type III module adjacent to its RGD site [13] ­ appears to contact the a subunit [14]. Gain-of-function analyses with integrin a-subunit chimeras demonstrated that full ligand-binding specificity is conferred by the second and third of the propeller blades [15], which flank the RGD-binding site, and an anti-a5 monoclonal antibody that selectively perturbs recognition of the synergy site maps to the loop between the third and fourth strands of blade three [13]. This suggests a model in which fibronectin binds the integrin across the side of the b propeller [7]. To test the model, and to define the contributions of other synergy sequences, structures of integrins complexed to macromolecular ligands are urgently required. Which divalent cations bind where? Many biochemical analyses have shown complex, multisite effects of manganese, magnesium and calcium ions on integrin function [16,17]. Integrins in vivo are most likely to encounter mixtures of calcium and magnesium ions, raising the questions of whether particular sites favour certain cations over others, whether integrins contain a mixture of cations under physiological conditions, and whether cation exchange is a mechanism whereby integrin activity is controlled in vivo. The relationship between the functional effects of cations on integrin conformation and ligand binding, and the structural locations of these sites is still not understood. The aVb3 crystal structures revealed

eight divalent cation-binding sites: four are coordinated by b­ loop­ b turns at the base of the b propeller, three are found in the ligand-binding pocket of the bA domain, and one is found at the a-subunit knee (Fig. 1). Current indications are that these sites ­ with the exception of the cation involved in ligand coordination ­ are required to stabilize the structure of the integrin, but this is not proven. It is particularly intriguing that the MIDAS site is flanked by two other cations, one of which was found in aVb3 with and without a bound ligand (termed ADMIDAS for `adjacent to MIDAS'), whereas the second was only occupied when the ligand was present (termed LIMBS for `ligand-induced metal-binding site'; Fig. 2a). Because the buffers used for integrin crystallization contained non-physiological concentrations of manganese and calcium, it is still unclear which cations occupy which sites in native integrins. Biochemical analyses of the various cation-binding sites through site-directed mutagenesis, and crystallization of integrins in mixed cation buffers are ideally needed to resolve these issues. Initial studies have indicated that the MIDAS site is the magnesium- and manganese-binding site responsible for both activation and ligand binding [18], but it remains to be established whether there is a variable repertoire of cation coordination options at this site, the purpose of which might be to generate a spectrum of ligand-binding affinities. What structural changes initiate integrin priming and activation? The need for integrin signalling to be controlled in a dynamic manner demands a mechanism for switching the receptor from an inactive to an active state, and vice versa, and for this switch to be controlled from both the ligandbinding pocket and the cytoplasmic face. Therefore, an important question is how activity and inactivity are determined at a structural level. Unlike most receptor biochemists and pharmacologists, who use the term `activation' to indicate ligand-induced signalling, researchers in the integrin field use activation to denote the switch from an inactive to an active state. For the purposes of this review, where the potential separability of these two processes needs to be considered, we have chosen to use the term `priming' to indicate the acquisition of ligand binding ability by integrins. How do conformational changes in the ligand-binding pocket alter ligand affinity? Although clustering of low-affinity receptor conformers enhances both the avidity of ligand binding and the formation of adhesion complexes [19], a large body of evidence ­ principally from biophysical studies and expression of neo-epitopes ­ suggests that both integrin priming and activation involve conformational changes [4]. The integrin crystal structures have revealed some of these changes, particularly in the A-domain modules, which are central to receptor function. The A-domain fold is found in several protein families other than integrins, including G proteins, acting as a conformational switch determining both ligand and effector binding. Early crystallographic analyses of isolated

exposure of ligand-binding sites [29]. It is unlikely that the subunits come apart, as contacts with both are needed for RGD engagement, but the extent to which the ligandbinding pocket is unmasked during priming will only become clear after further crystallographic analyses of both unoccupied and ligand-occupied integrins. How does the binding of cytoskeletal or signalling molecules to integrin cytoplasmic domains initiate priming? If cells are to regulate their adhesive behaviour in response to changes in their environment, conformational changes in the ligand-binding pocket of integrins need to be controlled from the cytoplasm, and effector coupling to integrin cytoplasmic domains needs to be controlled from the pocket. Although the mechanisms of intramolecular signal propagation that underlie these processes are still unclear, recent studies have revealed some of the events that initiate transmission from the cytoplasmic domains. Integrin cytoplasmic domains are normally , 50 amino acids in length, with the b-subunit sequences exhibiting greater homology to each other than the a-subunit sequences. This is consistent with current evidence that the b subunit is the principal site for binding of cytoskeletal and signalling molecules, whereas the a subunit has a regulatory role. These hypotheses imply that the two cytoplasmic domains interact with each other, but such associations have been difficult to detect using biophysical techniques. Although some studies have failed to detect an a­ b association [30,31], a recent NMR analysis of a complex between recombinant forms of the aIIb and b3 cytoplasmic domains confirms that this is the case [32] (Fig. 4). The first ten residues of the a-subunit cytoplasmic domain appear to form an a helix that is terminated by a proline residue. The remainder of the domain is highly acidic in nature and this loops back to contact the membrane-proximal lysine anchor residue. As neither the proline motif nor the acidic C terminus are conserved between integrins and the accessibility of the lysine anchor might be influenced by the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, the relevance of the folding back remains to be established. The first 20 amino acids of the b-subunit cytoplasmic domain are also a helical, but the final 25 residues are disordered and, apart from a turn that follows a conserved NPxY motif, appear to lack defined structure, suggesting that this is adopted on effector binding. The two membrane-proximal helices mediate the link between the subunits via a series of hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts. Previous studies have shown that the membraneproximal regions of both subunits are required to maintain integrins in an inactive state, and that mutations in conserved a-subunit phenylalanine and arginine residues lead to receptor activation [33]. Charge reversal mutations of the arginine and a conserved b-subunit aspartate residue suggested that a salt bridge might be involved in maintaining the inactive conformation, and the existence of this interaction was verified in the NMR structure of the complex. Furthermore, mutation of these residues, or addition of a fragment of the cytoskeletal protein talin (previously shown to activate aIIbb3), led to a loss of

integrin aA domains revealed two distinct conformations ­ a ligand-occupied `open' form and an unoccupied `closed' form (Fig. 3). Initiated by local rearrangements of surface loops, the major changes in the ligand-occupied confor° mation were a 10 A downward shift of the C-terminal a7 helix, and a smaller inward movement of the a1 helix [20 ­ 22]. Because the a7 helix is directly linked to the b propeller and from there to the rest of the integrin, it was proposed that priming and activation were mediated by a pistoning of this structural element. Several complementary lines of evidence confirm that the open A domain equates with high-affinity ligand binding. First, mutations that stabilize the open conformation enable high-affinity ligand binding [22]. Second, drugs that stabilize the closed conformation inhibit ligand binding and adhesion [23]. Third, locking the open and closed conformations through engineered disulfide bonds generates active and inactive forms of the A domain, respectively [24]. Fourth, as described above, all aA-domain crystal structures in the open conformation have a ligand or ligand mimic occupying the ligandbinding site. It is not yet known whether the same conformational changes observed for aA domains also take place in the bA domain. In particular, (1) it is unclear whether the location of the a7 helix in the aVb3 crystal structures equates to an open or a closed conformation [5,10], (2) little movement of the helix was observed on RGD binding (although crystal contacts will constrain movement) [6], (3) mutations in the aA domain that induce an open conformation are ineffective in the bA domain [25], and (4) a movement of the a1 helix has been shown to be involved in bA-domain priming [18,26]. The capacity for a7-helix movement, and therefore the extent of conservation of the mechanism of activation between a and b subunits, is uncertain. In addition to conformational changes in both the aA and bA domains, there is evidence for a quaternary change in the ligand pocket. First, addition of an RGD peptide to detergent-solubilized aIIbb3 caused an apparent split of the head into two nodules [27]. Second, aIIbb3 priming led to an increased accessibility and, therefore, rate of association of RGD [28]. Third, based on antibody crossblocking analyses, divalent cations were found to induce a conformational relaxation in the integrin that resulted in

heterodimer association, suggesting that integrin activation involves a separation of the cytoplasmic domains [32]. The mechanism of talin interaction with the b-subunit cytoplasmic domain has recently been determined from crystallographic analysis of a chimeric protein containing the integrin-binding portion of talin linked to a b-cytoplasmic domain peptide [34]. A novel form of the previously established phosphotyrosine-binding domain­ NPxY interaction was observed, with the integrin NPxY motif forming a reverse turn and docking with the talin FERM domain. It is likely that this structure represents a prototype for integrin associations with other signalling molecules. The degree of separation of the cytoplasmic domains during integrin priming is currently unclear, and the loss of intermolecular NOEs observed in NMR experiments does not necessarily distinguish between a conformational rearrangement that disrupts the resting state interface but maintains heterodimeric association, and a complete separation of the subunits. Ideally, crystallization of cytoplasmic-domain monomers or heterodimers with effectors or activators, such as talin, is required to resolve these possibilities. How are long-range conformational changes propagated through the integrin? Once conformational changes have reached the extracellular domain of the integrin, the substantial challenge of propagating them to the ligand-binding pocket remains. The simplest way to envisage this taking place would be for the two integrin legs to be rigid rods and, following their

separation, for gross conformational changes to be transferred to more subtle rearrangements of secondarystructure elements at the boundaries of the pocket. To some extent, this appears to be the case. In the aVb3 crystal structure, with the exception of the wobbly knees, most inter-module junctions in both legs have fairly large buried surface areas that might limit movement. Furthermore, the flexibility between the four EGF modules in the b-subunit leg, which is theoretically endowed by the low buried surface area at their junctions, is likely to be negated by a series of inter-module disulfide bonds that lead to a catenation of the region. Finally, the N-terminal b-subunit PSI domain is linked to the junction between the hybrid domain and the first EGF module by disulfide bonds, further constraining inter-module movement. There is also substantial experimental evidence that the legs of the integrin heterodimer move apart during the process of priming. First, clasping the C-terminal ends of recombinant, soluble a5b1 with a coiled-coil led to a suppression of ligand binding that was released by proteolytic cleavage of the clasp [35]. Concomitant with release of the clasp, EM analysis of the integrin revealed an ,14 nm separation of the C termini. Second, epitope mapping studies have shown that sites in the b-subunit leg recognized by certain reporter antibodies are shielded by the a subunit, but become re-exposed upon receptor priming [36]. Third, EM analyses of negatively stained aVb3 revealed two distinct orientations of the hybrid domain relative to the bA-domain [37] (Fig. 5). One conformation, which results in an acute angle between the b-subunit leg and head, is favoured in ligand-occupied specimens, suggesting that ligand engagement causes leg separation. Although the general features of long-range activation can be observed by EM, the detail of the chain of events leading from leg separation to structural changes in the ligand-binding pocket are not known. Adjustment of the hybrid-domain ­ bA-domain interface could certainly be linked to an alteration in the positioning of the a7 helix and thereby lead to modification of the ligand-binding pocket. In this regard, it is notable that the A-domain fold has its N and C termini close together, which means it is linked to the remainder of the integrin by two distinct connections. A torque generated about these pivots could

conceivably be linked to movement of secondary-structure elements in the A domain. Because the RGD ­ aVb3 structure involved soaking the ligand into pre-existing crystals, it is likely that the true extent of quaternary changes is yet to be observed at the atomic level. How do the two subclasses of integrins differ in their mechanisms of priming and activation? The existence of aA-domain-containing integrins raises interesting questions about the extent of conservation between the mechanisms of receptor priming and activation for the two integrin subclasses. If separation of the cytoplasmic domains is propagated to the ligand-binding pocket of non-aA-domain integrins, as shown for a5b1, does the same separation follow an identical route through the legs to the aA domain? Conversely, does ligand engagement by the aA domain and the b propeller­ bAdomain pockets converge at some point in the integrin? The fact that the aA domain is inserted into the same b-propeller loop contacted by the arginine of RGD supports this idea. If this is the case, both mechanisms predict the existence of a bA-domain ­ aA-domain relay, and an intriguing hypothesis has recently been presented along these lines [38]. Located two residues C-terminal to the end of the aA-domain a7 helix, is a completely conserved glutamate residue. The hypothesis predicts that movement of the a7 helix triggered by ligand binding leads to a repositioning of the glutamate such that it can act as a pseudoligand for the bA domain. A crystal structure of an aA-domain-containing integrin is required to test this hypothesis, but if it is valid it will be fascinating to test whether the same mechanism underlies receptor priming as well as activation. Does the bend in the integrin occur naturally, and is it functionally relevant? The knee bend was perhaps the most surprising feature of the first integrin crystal structure and, understandably, its relevance has been questioned. The most convincing evidence that a bent form of an integrin exists naturally has come from a series of studies combining highresolution imaging of negatively stained integrins using EM, analysis of the b subunit knee using NMR and biochemical investigations of mutated integrins. EM images of recombinant integrins in the presence of calcium (which fails to support ligand binding) and manganese (which converts integrins into a high-affinity conformation) revealed predominantly bent and extended forms, respectively [37] (Fig. 5). Solution of the structure of EGF repeat three and the junction between repeats two and three in the b2 subunit by NMR showed that some epitopes that become exposed on priming and residues that restrain priming have a buried location in the cleft of the knee [39]. aVb3 containing an engineered disulfide bond between the aV b-propeller and EGF repeat four of b3 ­ which should maintain the integrin in a bent conformation ­ was expressed at the cell surface in an inactive state [37]. If the bent form of the integrin is inactive, then features of the integrin crystal structure should be consistent with this. Obviously, if the transmembrane helices are arranged

in parallel to the legs, the ligand-binding pocket would be facing the plasma membrane. In addition, the conformation of the surface loops in the bA domain, and the position of the a7 helix, in the crystal are most similar to the closed form of the aA domains. The ability of the bent form to bind its ligand is probably explained by the ability of manganese to cause local loop rearrangements around the MIDAS motif independent of the normal quaternary changes underlying priming. Notably, the structural changes seen in the bA domain with and without RGD are the same as those that take place between the closed and open aA domains, but that movements are restricted by crystal contacts. Alternatively, the bent form might be active, and based on analyses of cross-competition between clusters of monoclonal antibodies, evidence that the bend is retained when platelets are treated with certain activating agents, such as ADP and thrombin, has been provided [40]. However, some concerns remain. Why is the b-subunit knee disordered in the crystals? Does this mean that the formation of crystals has led to a deformation of the receptor, or are the knees so conformationally variable that they do not crystallize in a single state? Is bending a feature of all integrins, or is it restricted to receptors that require strict control of their activation state? If bending is a common feature, is the steady-state of the equilibrium between bent and extended forms of an integrin different for different integrins (as suggested in Ref. [37]), such that some are primarily found in a bent, inactive state, and others are primarily extended and active? Only further structural analyses of more integrins will resolve these issues. In addition, are leg separation and unbending the sole mechanisms of receptor priming, or are other mechanisms possible? Because cation- and antibodymediated priming can be reproduced in minimized integrins truncated at the knees [18] and EM studies have shown that integrin extension and bA-domain conformational changes can be unlinked [37], then leg separation and unbending might not be sufficient. This raises the intriguing possibility that unbending and bA-domain conformation changes might not always be linked, but might be two separable stages of both priming and activation. Are integrin priming and signalling variable? A major implication of the definition of integrins as allosterically regulated receptors is that the well-established pharmacological concepts of agonism, partial agonism, antagonism and efficacy might apply to their function. Although this issue is not new [41], and it has been proposed to explain discrepancies between the biological effects of pharmacological inhibitors of integrins and integrin-gene knockouts [42], it is currently the least well understood aspect of integrin function. It is known that different ligands induce different shape changes in integrins and/or stabilize different conformers [43,44], that different priming agents induce different extracellular conformations in integrins [40] and that the ligandbinding pocket can be engineered to alter signalling [45], but if the concept of integrin agonism is to be approached experimentally, the extent to which signalling is regulated

from the extracellular face, the ability of different ligands to induce different signals (or degree of signalling) and, crucially, the structural basis of diversity in signalling need to be addressed. In particular, if an integrin is primed with its cytoplasmic domains separated, how does the cell know whether it has bound to a ligand? Is this model wrong, or are there additional conformational changes that take place down the legs or via other integrin domains? Are there discrete conformers representing inactive and primed states of an integrin, or is activation a continuum? A related question is whether the structural basis of inside-to-out priming is the same as outside-to-in ligand activation. If so, is integrin efficacy determined kinetically by the time spent by integrins engaging cytoskeletal effectors? As for research in other fields, structural analysis of different integrin-ligand and integrin-effector complexes will shed light on these issues. Concluding remarks The enormous insights into protein function that are provided by structure determination are now self-evident to the integrin field but its contribution is just beginning. If answers to fundamental questions about the specificity of ligand binding, the transmembrane changes responsible for receptor priming, the mechanisms of ligand-induced signalling and the application of concepts such as agonism and efficacy are to be obtained, more structures are needed. In addition, certain answers will require the solution of ever more complex structures. Not only binaryligand ­ receptor and receptor­ effector complexes, but ternary complexes and ultimately multi-molecular assemblies that mediate adhesion signalling. Thus, the substantial advances described in this review are not the end of an era, but the beginning.
