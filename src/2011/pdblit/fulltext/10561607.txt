The solution structure via 1H NMR of the fully reduced form of cytochrome c7 has been obtained. The protein sample was kept reduced by addition of catalytic amounts of Desulfovibrio gigas iron hydrogenase in H2 atmosphere after it had been checked that the presence of the hydrogenase did not affect the NMR spectrum. A final family of 35 conformers with rmsd values with respect to the mean structure of 8.7 ^ 1.5 nm and 12.4 ^ 1.3 nm for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively, was obtained. A highly disordered loop involving residues 54±61 is present. If this loop is ignored, the rmsd values are 6.2 ^ 1.1 nm and 10.2 ^ 1.0 nm for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively, which represent a reasonable resolution. The structure was analyzed and compared with the already available structure of the fully oxidized protein. Within the indetermination of the two solution structures, the result for the two redox forms is quite similar, confirming the special structural features of the three-heme cluster. A useful comparison can be made with the available crystal structures of cytochromes c3, which appear to be highly homologous except for the presence of a further heme. Finally, an analysis of the factors affecting the reduction potentials of the heme irons was performed, revealing the importance of net charges in differentiating the reduction potential when the other parameters are kept constant. Keywords: multiheme cytochrome; NMR; reduction potentials; solution structure.

Cytochrome c7 from Desulfuromonas acetoxidans is a 68-amino acid protein with three heme groups. It shows great homology, on alignment, with the better known cytochrome c3, which has about 110 amino acids and four hemes [1,2]. Cytochrome c7, similarly to cytochrome c3, is involved in the sulfur cycle, in particular the reduction of elemental sulfur to sulfide, and exhibits metal reductase activity [3,4]. Cytochrome c3 interacts with an hydrogenase which acts as a physiological partner, and this is probably also true for cytochrome c7 [5]. The solution structure of the fully oxidized cytochrome c7 from D. acetoxidans has been solved by NMR [6,7]. The three hemes are paramagnetic and the NMR lines are greatly broadened. Only two of six imidazole rings of the co-ordinated histidines could be detected and reasonably located within the three-dimensional structure. Despite this, the backbone atoms had an rmsd value of 7.8 ^ 1.2 nm. The structure has a C-shaped appearance with a loop containing residues 54±61 that is quite disordered. This loop connects heme III with heme IV. No high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data are available for c7 cytochromes, although some preliminary data on the iron±iron distances and relative heme orientations are available in the literature [8]. When proteins involved in electron transfer are being considered, a knowledge of the structure of the protein in the two oxidation states is of paramount importance. NMR spectroscopy allows complete characterization of a

protein in a given oxidation state. We report here an attempt to solve the solution structure of the fully reduced form in order to compare it with that of the oxidized species and to gather information about the structure±function relationship. Cytochrome c7 has been expressed in Desulfovibrio species [9]. However, its overproduction, which would allow isotope labeling, is difficult as it is a c-type protein. Furthermore, the shape of this protein is quite unfavorable for determination of the solution structure, as it relies on constraints that are short range in nature, such as NOEs. Finally, because of the low reduction potentials of the iron ions (in the range 2100 to 2200 mV [10,11]), it is difficult to keep the protein in the reduced state. Nevertheless, a reliable structural model has been obtained. The properties that determine the different reduction potentials for the various hemes will also be addressed.

NMR sample preparation Cytochrome c7 from D. acetoxidans was obtained and purified as reported [6]. The 1H-NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein in 100 mm phosphate buffer to give 2±3 mm solutions. These were deoxygenated under argon atmosphere and then saturated with hydrogen. The reduction of the protein was achieved by adding a deoxygenated solution of Desulfovibrio gigas iron hydrogenase in catalytic amounts. For comparison purposes, the spectra were also recorded by reducing the protein with sodium dithionite without hydrogenase.

NMR spectroscopy
1 H-NMR spectra were recorded in both H2O and 2H2O solutions at pH 5.5, 6.5, 8.0. Suppression of the water signal was achieved by its presaturation during the relaxation delay and the mixing time in the case of 2H2O solutions, and by gradient tailored excitation (WATERGATE) [12] in the case of H2O solutions. 1 H-NMR NOESY and TOCSY spectra at 292 K were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 operating at 500.13 MHz, on a spectral width of 19.99 p.p.m., with a relaxation delay of 700 ms. A mixing time of 100 ms for NOESY spectra, and spin-lock times in the range 85.8±93.2 ms for TOCSY spectra were used. Time proportional phase incrementation (TPPI) NOESY [13,14] experiments in H2O solution were recorded on a Bruker Avance 800 spectrometer operating at 800.13 MHz, on a spectral width of 16.02 p.p.m., with a relaxation delay of 600 ms and a mixing time of 100 ms. The spectra consisted of 2000 data points in the F2 dimension; 512±750 experiments were recorded in the F1 dimension. Raw data were multiplied in both dimensions by a pure cosine-squared bell window function and Fouriertransformed to obtain 512±1024 Â 1024±2048 real data points. A polynomial baseline correction was applied in both directions. Data processing was performed using the standard Bruker sofware package. The two-dimensional maps were analyzed on IBM RISC 6000 computers with the aid of the program xeasy [15].

heme III are linked to cysteines 49 and 52, those of heme IV are linked to cysteines 62 and 65). The choice of the above upper limits, as in the case of the fully oxidized protein, is justified on the basis of the available structures of class III cytochromes [18±24]. A total of 1677 distance constraints derived from twodimensional NOESY connectivities were used in dyana calculations. Some 500 random structures were annealed in 10 000 steps using the above constraints. The 35 conformers with the lowest target function were included in the family. Structure refinement was performed through restrained energy minimization in vacuo with the amber 4.1 program [25,26]. The force field parameters and the topology file for the heme groups were taken as previously used for the oxidized protein [7], except for the charges that were reduced by one unit for each heme. A force constant of 134 kJ´mol21 was used for the NOE-derived distance constraints. Structure analysis The structure quality was checked by analyzing the structures through the procheck program [27], which provided the elements of the secondary structure, Ramanchandran plot, and other statistical parameters. Electrostatic potential calculations The energy-minimized averaged solution structure of the fully oxidized cytochrome c7 [7] was used as a starting point. The structure was solvated with a 100-nm-thick shell of water molecules. The water molecules were equilibrated through energy-minimization and molecular-dynamics calculations, keeping the protein atoms fixed. Finally the whole system (water + protein) was energy minimized. The electrostatic potential calculations were performed with the delphi program package which solves the Poisson±Boltzmann equation when a distribution of charges and dielectric constants is given [28±30]. A radius was assigned to all the protein atoms from the delphi database. The effect of varying dielectric constants (from 2 to 80) for the protein interior was analyzed, while a dielectric constant of 80 was used for the solvent. A probe radius of 14 nm, which defines the water-accessible surface, was chosen. The partial charges of the protein atoms were taken from the amber database [25,26], and those of the atoms belonging to the hemes, axial histidines and cysteines covalently linked to the hemes were taken as previously reported [7,31,32]. The change in heme electron distribution on reduction is positioned at the iron center (20.6) and at the six donor atoms (20.4 equally distributed between them) for each heme. Calculations were performed with the assumption that all lysines and glutamic and aspartic acids are ionized. The protein structure was mapped on to a 65 Â 65 Â 65 point grid, and the Poisson±Boltzmann equation was iteratively solved using a finite difference method [28,33]. To ensure that the calculations were not sensitive to grid dimensions, a series of three focusing calculations were performed [34]. The final grid spacing was 0.14 grids´nm21 . The electrostatic free energy of reduction (DGred) is evaluated as the sum of the following terms: (a) pairwise interactions of the heme charges with the charges and dipoles in the protein, screened by the polarizability of solvent and protein (DGch + DGdip) [35]; (b) the reaction field energy (solvation energy) due to the polarization of electrons and dipoles in the solvent and in the protein induced by reduction of the heme (DDGsolv) [36]. The contribution of the protein charges has been further factorized

Proton±proton distance constraints The volumes of the NOESY cross-peaks between assigned resonances were obtained by manual integration, with the elliptical integration routine implemented in the program xeasy. NOESY cross-peak intensities were converted into upper limits of interatomic distances by following the methodology of the program caliba [16]. Structure calculation and refinement The experimental distance constraints were used to generate protein conformers through the dyana program [17]. A residue containing the heme moiety was added to the standard library as a protein residue. As in previously reported studies [7], axial ligands were left free to reach their correct orientations with respect to the heme and in the protein frame only through the effect of experimental constraints, without any structural assumption. The heme moieties were linked to the amino acid sequence; each heme was linked to the tail of the protein by a chain constituted of 30 pseudo-residues (LLM). These special linker residues, contained in the standard library, are formed by atoms with null Van der Waals radius and are free to penetrate the polypeptide chain. In order to link the iron atoms to their own axial ligands, some distance constraints were introduced: the N12 of histidines 17 and 30 were linked to the iron atom of heme I, those of histidines 20 and 53 were linked to that of heme III and those of histidines 45 and 66 to that of heme IV, by introducing an upper distance limit of 22.0 nm and a lower distance contraint of 19.0 nm. Upper (21.0 nm) and lower (18.0 nm) distance limits from the a carbons of thioethers of the heme moieties to the Sg of cysteines were used in the calculations to link the heme moiety to the bound cysteines (the a carbons of thioethers 2 and 4 of heme I are linked to the Sg of cysteines 26 and 29, respectively, those of

into the two terms: DGch is the contribution due to the net charges of the protein, and DGdip is the contribution due to the protein dipoles produced by all the partial charges on all protein atoms except those of the charged residues. DGch was evaluated for each heme in the protein by assigning the amber charges to the charged residues (Asp, Glu, Lys) and to the other two heme cores (iron + heme + ligands + cysteines), and null charges to the rest of the protein. DGdip was evaluated by assigning the amber charges to the uncharged residues and null charges to the rest (including two heme cores). This latter term was further factorized into the contribution due to the hydrogen bonds and dipoles derived from the CONH peptide groups (DGCONH) and the contribution of all the other dipoles in the protein. DGCONH was evaluated as the difference between a calculation of DGdip as described above and the same calculation performed not including the charges on the CONH atoms. To ensure that the overall charge of the protein is not altered, the latter calculation was performed by assigning each of the four atoms one-fourth of the total charge of the CONH group, which amounts to 20.114. The potential values have been obtained by converting the delphi DGred expressed in kJ´mol21 into a DE value in mV and then adding a constant term chosen in such a way that the reduction potential of heme IV is always equal to the experimentally determined value of 2102 mV.

excess sodium dithionite. Under these conditions, the sample remained in the reduced state for about 4 h. The twodimensional spectra of the two samples were very similar, indicating that the hydrogenase did not affect the structure of the protein. The spectra are consistent with those reported in the literature which aimed to assign the heme [38]. The assignment has now been extended to a larger number of protein resonances. The sequence-specific assignment was performed by taking advantage of some unique features in the primary sequence, such as the contiguity of two valine residues only in positions 3 and 4, the presence of only one tyrosine (Tyr6), the uniqueness of the segments Ala-His-Ala (19±21) and Ile-Ala-Ile (37±39), and the presence of two adjacent glycines in positions 63 and 64. Also very useful as starting points for the assignment are the cysteines, which give rise to many dipolar connectivities with the protons of the heme to which they are covalently bound. On these bases, it has been possible to perform the assignment for the majority of the resonances. Most of the NH protons can only be detected in WATERGATE spectra, while they disappear in those recorded with presaturation of the water signal. A total number of 373 proton resonances have now been assigned, which correspond to 79% of the total expected proton signals (78% of the amino acid residues, 82% of the heme resonances). No resonance assignment was possible for residues 1, 58, and for propionate-7 of heme I, and only a few resonances could be identified for the protons of residues 59, 60, and 61.

Sequence-specific assignment Owing to the low values of the reduction potentials of the three metallic centers [10,37], the protein shows strong tendency towards oxidation, such that it was possible to maintain the completely reduced form only in a H2 atmosphere and in the presence of catalytic amounts of hydrogenase. The spectra were also recorded for a solution that was freshly reduced with Secondary-structure analysis Some elements of secondary structure can be identified just by analyzing the NOE patterns reported in Fig. 1, which shows the short-range and medium-range NOEs observed for the backbone and b protons. Sequential connectivities involving NH are interrupted by the presence of prolines 34 and 59, and by the unassigned residue 58. An antiparallel b-sheet involving

residues 2±18 is clearly indicated by the presence of long-range (i.e. between residues in the 2±8 range and residues in the 11±18 range) backbone NOEs. Short-range and medium-range connectivities of the type (i,i + 2) (i,i + 3) (i,i + 4), involving backbone and b protons, are observed for residues 18±24, 25±30, 43±46, 47±53, and 62±65 (Fig. 1), indicating the presence of helices in these regions. Solution-structure calculations A total of 1677 unique NOESY experimental constraints have been obtained, and their distribution is shown in Fig. 2A. These NOE constraints were transformed into upper distance limits

with the program caliba, which uses a volume to distance correlation. The best calibration of observed intensities was found to be inversely proportional to the fifth or sixth power of the proton±proton distances, depending on the calibration class of NOE constraints. It was found that 1352 out of the total 1677 experimental constraints were meaningful and therefore used in the dyana calculations. The average number of experimental NOE constraints per residue is 23.6 (considering each heme as a further protein residue), which compares well with the 24.1 constraints obtained by Messias et al. [39] for cytochrome c3. The average number of meaningful constraints obtained for the present system is 19.0, and that of cytochrome c3 is 20.6. For the fully reduced cytochrome c7, the resulting family, constituted by 35 conformers, experiences target function values in the 67±114 nm2 range, resulting in a mean value of 96 ^ 14 nm2. The conformers have rmsd values with respect to the mean structure of 9.0 ^ 1.5 nm and 12.5 ^ 1.4 nm for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively. Each conformer of the family was subjected to restrained energy minimization calculations. The resulting family (Fig. 3) is characterized by rmsd values with respect to the mean structure of 8.7 ^ 1.5 nm and 12.4 ^ 1.3 nm for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively (Fig. 2B). The total distance penalty is 6570 ^ 1040 kJ´nm2´mol21, which corresponds to an average target function value of 49 ^ 8.0 nm2. The protein regions characterized by the largest rmsd values in Fig. 2B correspond to those containing unassigned residues and/or residues for which a limited number of NOESY connectivities could be assigned (Fig. 2A). In particular, the loop involving residues 54±61 is quite disordered. Rmsd values calculated superimposing residues 3±53 and 62±66 are significantly lower: 6.2 ^ 1.1 nm and 10.2 ^ 1.0 nm for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively. A similar feature was also found for the fully oxidized protein [7] and probably reflects an intrinsic disorder of this external loop. The parameters quantifying the agreement between the constraints and the final family of structures, as well as the total energy, are summarized in Table 1. These figures are comparable with those found for the fully oxidized protein [7]. The co-ordinates of the conformers of the family were averaged and then energy-minimized to provide the average structure used in the subsequent analysis. Structure analysis The analysis of the energy-minimized average has shown that, of 58 residues that are `meaningful' for the Ramachandran plot

The number of meaningful constraints for each class is reported in parentheses. b Medium-range distance constraints are those between residues (i,i + 2) (i,i + 3) (i,i + 4) and (i,i + 5). c The precision of the atomic co-ordinates is defined as the rmsd between the 35 structures of the family and the mean coordinates. d The programs procheck and prochecknmr [53] were used to check the overall quality of the structure. For the procheck statistic, less than 10 bad contacts per 100 residues, an average hydrogen bond energy in the range 2.5±4.0 kJ´mol21 and an overall G-factor larger than 20.5 are expected for a good-quality structure.

(i.e. nonglycine, nonproline, and nonterminal residues), 62.1% fall in the most favored regions, 31.0% in the additional allowed regions, and 6.9% in the generously allowed regions. No residues are found in the disallowed regions. The Ramachandran plot together with the data reported in Table 1 therefore shows that a good-quality structure has been obtained. procheck analysis also provided the secondary-structure elements: a b-sheet is composed of the 4±6 and 13±15 strands; three helical segments are present at positions 17±25, 41±47, 49±52; residues 26±30 form a turn. The reduced form shows an overall fold very close to that of the oxidized protein. The rmsd values between the two structures is 16.2 nm for the backbone and 20.2 nm for the heavy atoms. The comparison of the structures of the two oxidation states confirms the presence, in the reduced species, of all the secondary-structure elements reported for the oxidized protein, besides the fact that the b-strands are shorter in the former. This feature could be due to the observation of a smaller number of NOE constraints, in the present system, among the residues involved in this structure element. In the fully oxidized protein, the presence of the 50 H s helix, the C-terminus of which contains the distal ligand of heme IV, was proposed on the basis of the medium-range connectivities, but did not result from the procheck analysis. In the fully reduced protein, it is now clearly detectable. The same holds for the a-helix at positions 27±30, which is well defined in the fully reduced cytochrome c7. In the fully

oxidized protein this structural element was not detectable (although some (i,i + 3) (i,i + 4) and (i,i + 2) connectivities were present for these residues), but is present in the crystal structures of oxidized c3 cytochromes [18±20,23,24,40]. The major differences for the protein backbone in the two redox forms are located at positions 56±61, as shown in Figs 4A and 5. This protein region corresponds to the external disordered loop (rmsd values with respect to the average structure in the 15±25 nm range) and contains residue 58, the resonances of which have not been identified. This loop connects heme IV to the rest of the protein; nevertheless heme IV is relatively well defined in the present structure thanks to the many NOEs observed between its protons and residues in various parts of the protein. (20 NOEs have been detected between heme IV and Lys10,9 with Val13,10 with heme III.) No meaningful differences between the two oxidation states are observed for the amino acid side chains (Fig. 4B). The solvent accessibility of the various residues in the fully reduced species, resulting from procheck analysis, was compared with that of the fully oxidized species. It appears essentially the same except for residues 59±60 which belong to the poorly defined loop where the main differences between the two redox forms are found. However, owing to the low structure resolution for this protein region, they are probably meaningless. The structure described above represents the first determination for the fully reduced cytochrome c7. In Table 2 the

(193 nm [8]) and cytochrome c3 (175±180 nm [41,42]). For the reduced state, a structural model for the heme core arrangement has been reported [38], based on NOESY-derived interheme upper and lower distance constraints together with hemederived ring current shifts. This structural model was described in terms of heme Fe±Fe distances with good agreement with respect to our results for two of the three distances. In Table 3 the angles between heme planes are reported for the fully reduced and fully oxidized cytochrome c7. It appears that they are the same, within experimental error, because the errors on the heme planes derived from rmsd are up to ^ 7.48. For comparison purposes, the angles between iron atoms are also reported in Table 3. There is a good agreement between the structures in solution and the X-ray crystallographic data. Description of the iron ligands In the oxidized form only the ring protons of the two histidines bound to heme I (His17 and His30) were assigned, and the orientation of the other histidines resulted from the steric requirements of the protein structure and was affected by large indetermination [7]. We gained confidence in the conformation of these side chains from the analysis of the magnetic susceptibility tensor properties of the hemes which relates the orientation of the tensor to the bisector of the two imidazole planes [7]. In the present case, the His orientations were determined experimentally for residues 20, 30, 53 and 66. The

results for the fully reduced cytochrome c7 in solution are compared with those for the fully oxidized cytochrome c7 in solution [7], and preliminary X-ray crystallographic data on the oxidized protein [8]. The Fe±Fe distances for hemes I and III are the same in all the cases. The Fe±Fe distances for hemes III and IV vary less than 10 nm between the two solution structures, the distance in the reduced species being slightly larger. The different iron±iron distance for the heme pair I±IV in the solution structures of oxidized and reduced species is at the limit of the rmsd and can be ascribed, at least in part, to the fact that heme IV is connected to the rest of the protein through loop 54±61 which is poorly defined in both solution structures. However, an Fe(I)±Fe(IV) distance of 180±190 nm compares well with that of the crystallographic data for cytochrome c7

It appears that His30 and His66 are essentially fixed in a certain orientation, while His20 has slightly larger indetermination within the family. The four interresidue NOEs observed for the imidazole ring of His53 have quite low intensity (giving rise to distance constraints falling in the range 49±75 nm, with the present automatic calibration) and leave an indetermination on its orientation even larger than that of the two unassigned histidines His17 and His45. The a angle of His53 ranges between 97.7 and 188.1 within the family. In an attempt to determine more precisely the orientation of the His53, we calculated the intensities of its NOE cross-peaks as they depend on the orientation of this histidine. These calculations were performed by using a relaxation matrix approach with the program corma [43]. For one extreme a angle value in the original family, strong NOEs are expected which are not observed, while for the angle in the average structure and for the other extreme orientation all the calculated NOEs are experimentally observed. On the basis of this analysis, the four NOEs involving the imidazole ring of His53 were recalibrated. The new distance constraints produce a significant decrease in the indetermination of the His53 imidazole ring orientation, the a angle changing from 142.9 ^ 45.28 to 131.7 ^ 20.08, as reported in Table 4. The a angle reported in Table 4 for His17 in the energy-minimized average structure is on the upper edge of the range of a angles measured within the family; this could be explained by the fact that from the energetic point of view this orientation is favored by the formation of an hydrogen bond between the Hd1 of the imidazole ring and the carbonyl oxygen of Ala1. Although determined from different sets of constraints, the orientation of the axial ligands in the fully reduced and fully oxidized cytochrome c7 in solution appears to be the same within indetermination. The geometry of the axial ligands of the hemes determined from the X-ray structures of the various cytochromes c3 shows some interesting differences from that of c7. In all the cytochromes c3, the ligands of heme I are almost parallel (b angles in the range 2±108). An almost parallel arrangement has also been observed for the ligands of heme III (b angles in the range 5±158 for Desulfovibrio cytochromes and about 258 for Desulfomicrobium cytochromes). Two different possibilities exist for heme IV: in Desulfovibrio cytochromes the imidazole planes are again almost parallel

(b angles in the range 7±158), whereas in Desulfomicrobium cytochromes they form an angle of 70±808. The latter situation for heme IV resembles that of heme IV in cytochrome c7. Also the geometry of the axial ligands of heme III is closer to that observed for the same heme in Desulfomicrobium (b angles of the order of 258), rather than that of Desulfovibrio cytochromes (b angles of the order of 5±158). In contrast, the arrangement of the axial ligands of heme I is unique to cytochrome c7, the two histidine planes being almost perpendicular. The angles given in Tables 4 and 5 are important for defining the imidazole ring orientation and can be directly related to spectral parameters in the case of the oxidized protein. It has been recently demonstrated that the acute angle b between the two histidine planes and the f angle between the bisector of the angle b and the metal±pyrrole II axis can be used in a heuristic equation describing the relation between the contact and pseudocontact shifts and the conformation of the axial ligands [44]. The calculated f and b angles can be obtained by fitting the heme methyl shifts of the fully oxidized protein. These angles compare reasonably well with those found experimentally for hemes I and III; the b angle of heme IV is also in good agreement, whereas the f value differs by about 508. However, the latter angle is also the one showing the largest error during fitting (^ 278). Comments on the relative redox potentials The reduction potentials for the three hemes in cytochrome c7 have been reported to be E1 = ±102 mV, E2 = E3 = ±170 mV [10], or E1 = ±140 mV, E2 = ±210 mV, E3 = ±240 mV [11]. From stepwise reduction of the protein followed by NMR spectroscopy it has been possible to determine that the highreduction potential center is heme IV [6,45]. The reduction potentials for the three hemes calculated by the delphi program are reported in Fig. 6 as a function of the protein dielectric constant. For dielectric constant values greater than 4, the order of reduction potentials more or less follows the experimental data, heme IV being the one with the highest value. The finding that relatively high dielectric constant values are needed to reproduce the order of redox potentials is consistent with previous results [46,47] and with a presumably large hydration of the protein because of its shape and small size. The reduction potential of the other two hemes remains too high, in particular that of heme I. This behavior is summarized in Table 6, in which the differences in the reduction potentials (DEi,j ) calculated for each heme pair are reported as a function of the protein dielectric constant and

Fig. 6. Calculated reduction potentials for heme I (O), heme III (X) and heme IV (B) in cytochrome c7 for various values of the protein dielectric constant. The potential values reported were obtained by converting the delphi DGred expressed in kJ´mol21 in a DE value in mV and then adding a constant term chosen in such a way that the reduction potential of heme IV is always equal to the experimentally determined value of 2102 mV. Table 6. Experimental [10,11] and calculated differences in reduction potentials (mV) for the possible heme pairs of cytochrome c7 for various values of the protein dielectric constant. In [10] and [11] three reduction potential values have been experimentally determined but not assigned to specific hemes. We are here reporting the differences in the reduction potential between the three centers, naming 1 that with the highest reduction potential value, 2 the one with intermediate value, and 3 the one with lowest value, as discussed in the text.

compared with those observed experimentally [10,11]. Whereas for dielectric constant values of 15±20 the difference in reduction potentials between heme IV and heme III agrees reasonably well with the experimental values, the difference in reduction potential between heme IV and heme I is too small and that between heme III and heme I is always too large. An increase in the dielectric constant values produces a decrease in DEI,III and also a decrease in DEIV,III. Nevertheless, the results obtained are reasonably good when considering the accuracy of the theoretical approach, and also in comparison with previously reported calculations performed on Rhodopseudomonas viridis four-heme cytochrome [48] and Fe±S proteins [49]. Besides the ability to reproduce the experimental values, the method is particularly useful for factorizing out the various contributions to the reduction potentials. The results obtained for each heme iron are summarized in Table 7. Whereas the effect of dipoles is a minor contribution and does not differ much from one heme to the other, net charges and solvation appear to be the determining factors. A large negative contribution to heme IV arising from the net charges is in agreement with the structural finding that heme IV is surrounded by several Lys residues and therefore is located in a substantially positive environment. The same heme has also been found to have the highest reduction potential in cytochrome c3 [50]. The importance of net charges in differentiating the reduction potential when the other parameters are kept constant is consistent with previous findings on high-potential Fe-S proteins [49]. Conclusions The solution structure of the fully reduced cytochrome c7 is essentially similar, within the present structure resolution, in the secondary and tertiary structural features to the fully oxidized

protein. The heme core is remarkably well conserved. The similarity to the stuctures of the four-heme Desulvofibrio cytochrome c3 is notable, if it is considered that heme II is missing. Also the secondary-structural elements are essentially identical for cytochromes c7 and c3. Only the orientation of the histidine planes of the co-ordinated histidines appear to be different in the two systems. In both cytochrome c7 and c3 proteins, the electrostatic potential calculations are able to reproduce the experimental finding that heme IV is the one with the highest reduction potential [6,45]. Its large reduction potential can be accounted for mainly by the large negative contribution to DGox derived from the net charges, which is due to its location in a protein region rich in Lys residues. The presence of many positively charged residues around the heme with the highest reduction potential is a common feature for cytochromes c3 and it has been proposed to be important for the molecular recognition of the partner hydrogenase, heme IV always being the interacting site of the molecules [51,52]. The structural analogies between cytochromes c3 and cytochrome c7 demonstrated here are reinforced by the experimental observation that the D. gigas iron hydrogenase can be used efficiently to reduce cytochrome c7.
