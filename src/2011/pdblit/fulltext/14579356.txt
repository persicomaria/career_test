ABSTRACT The subunits in calpain and in the related penta-EF-hand (PEF) proteins are bound through contacts between the unpaired EF-hand 5 from each subunit. To study subunit binding further, a tetra-EF-hand 18 kDa N- and C-terminally truncated form of the calpain small subunit was prepared (18k). This protein does not combine with the calpain large subunit to form active calpain, but forms homodimers in solution, as shown by ultracentrifugation. The X-ray structure of the 18k protein in the presence of cadmium was solved to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The structure of the monomer is almost identical to the known structure of the calpain small subunit, but the 18k protein forms an oligomer in the crystal by the use of two binding sites. One of these sites is an artefact arising from the C-terminal truncation, but the other is a naturally occurring site that is fully exposed to water in intact purified calpain. The characteristics of this site suggest that it may be important in binding other protein modulators involved in the regulation of calpain and of PEF proteins. Proteins 2003;53:649 ­ 655.

INTRODUCTION We have been interested in studying the nature of subunit binding in calpain, which is a heterodimer of 80 and 28 kDa subunits. The mode of interaction of these subunits was largely resolved by X-ray crystallography. A major zone of subunit contact lies between two of the calpain domains that are founding members of the pentaEF-hand (PEF) protein family. We describe here further work on a truncated form of the calpain small subunit. This has revealed the existence of a second natural binding surface that could be important for the function of calpain and other PEF proteins. The principal mammalian calpains, - and m-calpain, are heterodimeric cysteine proteinases, composed of a large catalytic subunit (80 kDa) and a small, regulatory subunit (28 kDa).1 The large subunit contains four domains, of which the C-terminal domain, domain IV, contains 5 apparent EF-hand motifs. The small subunit contains two domains, namely domain V, which is a relatively unstructured domain with several poly-Gly regions, and a C-terminal domain, domain VI, which also contains 5 apparent EF-hand domains. Domain VI has approximately 50% amino acid sequence identity with domain IV. These two C-terminal domains were among the

first recognized examples of the wider family of penta-EFhand proteins.2 The isolated domain VI of the small subunit (referred to as 21k) was crystallized both with and without Ca2 .3­5 The structure was found to be a homodimer with dyad symmetry, the interface being formed by contact of the fifth EF-hand motif from each monomer. There was only a small conformational difference between the Ca2 -free and Ca2 -bound forms, and the homodimer did not dissociate in the presence of Ca2 . Ca2 was bound in a conventional manner in EF-hands 1­3, in an unusual coordination in EF-hand 4, and was not bound in EF-hand 5. The X-ray crystal structure of the complete calpain molecule in the absence of Ca2 (with or without domain V) was then solved.6,7 In these (80k 21k) or (80k 28k) heterodimers, the binding interface between the two subunits is again formed by the fifth EF-hand motif from each subunit, although additional binding occurs between the N-terminal peptide of the large subunit and the 21k small subunit. Domain V, in the 28k protein, is highly flexible and could not be detected in the electron density.7 EF-hands are most commonly found in pairs. In domain IV of calpain, EF-hands 1 and 2 interact to form a pair, as do EF-hands 3 and 4. EF-hand 5 of domain IV does not partner with another EF-hand in the domain but when subunit binding occurs, this has the effect of pairing two EF-hand motifs, one from domain IV of the small subunit and the EF-hand 5 from domain IV.8 In other penta-EFhand proteins, the fifth EF-hand is similarly unpaired, and is used in the formation of homodimers. This has been shown for grancalcin9 and for ALG-2.10 Modelling of sorcin11 suggests that it behaves identically. C-terminal truncation of the PEF proteins ALG-2 and peflin, removing

the fifth EF-hand, abolishes homodimer formation. It has also been shown that addition of Ca2 to a heterodimer of peflin and ALG-2 causes dissociation.11 In contrast, addition of Ca2 to the homodimer of sorcin caused the formation of tetramers depending on pH and temperature.12 It was, therefore, of interest to study further the factors that influence dimer formation in calpain, and several unsuccessful attempts were made to design a monomeric form of the calpain small subunit. Removal of 25 C-terminal amino acid residues (which include EF-hand 5) from the 21k small subunit, generated a protein defined here as 18k. This truncation abolished its ability to form active calpain on co-expression with the large subunit in E. coli.13,14 However, although this18k protein is well expressed in E. coli, it is still not monomeric. The truncated subunit is found to form a

new type of oligomer, both in solution and within a protein crystal, by recruiting an alternative surface of the protein for binding. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Modification, Expression, and Purification The cDNA for the 18k protein, encoding residues 87­245 of the calpain small subunit, was constructed in the vector pET20 as previously described.13 The protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli and purified as for the 21k protein using established column procedures on DEAESepharose, Sephadex G-75, and Q-Sepharose.15 Analytical Ultracentrifugation Sedimentation equilibrium was carried out at 20°C in a Beckman Model E Analytical Ultracentrifuge using

The run was performed at a speed of 11,000 rpm until there was no significant difference in r2/2 vs. fringe displacement photographs taken 2 h apart, showing that equilibrium had been achieved. The data were evaluated using the NONLIN program, which incorporates a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting algorithm, and allows the analysis of both single and multiple data files.17 Data can be fitted either to a single ideal species model or to models containing up to four associating species. The partial specific volume and the solvent density of the protein were estimated using the SEDNTERP program, which incorporates computational methods detailed in Laue et al.18

A rotation of the top oligomeric chain to produce the bottom view displays the symmetry of the structure as "new" pairs of molecules appear to form the same homodimer complex.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination Crystals of the 18k protein were obtained by hanging drop vapour diffusion, using a mother liquor solution of 30% PEG 400, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6), and 0.1 M cadmium chloride at room temperature, and a 10 mg/ml protein solution in 25 mM PIPES, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM DTT. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature using a Rigaku Cu-K rotating anode and Mar Research imaging plate. Data were processed using the programs DENZO and Scalepack.19 The structure of the 18k protein was solved using the AMORE molecular replacement program within the CCP4 program suite.20 A 25 amino acid C-terminally truncated monomer of the 21-kDa small subunit structure (PDB code 1DVI) was used as the search model. There were two molecules within the asymmetric unit, and refinement was

carried out using the CNS program package without the use of non-crystallographic restraints.21 The coordinates of the final structure have been deposited in PDB (accession code 1NP8). Structure figures were generated using Molscript22 and Sybyl (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) and identification of contact residue distances was performed in CNS.21 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Solution Composition Analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that the 18k protein is present as a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution, fitting a monomer-dimer self-association model (Fig. 1). The apparent molecular mass from the sedimentation equilibrium studies is 30,718 kDa, whereas the calculated molecular mass for a monomer of the 18k protein is 18,355 kDa. It has been shown previously that the 18k

result of the C-terminal truncation. This contact region encompasses 10% of the entire surface area of the two molecules. The two patches are sufficiently remote from each other on each monomer to avoid steric hindrance, and crystal packing in the X-ray structure revealed the presence of an oligomer of 18k, bound through these two patches. Subunit Binding and New Binding Site As described earlier, the calpain subunits and PEF proteins are bound through their EF-hand 5 motifs, but in calpain there is additional binding between the Nterminus of the large subunit and the calpain small subunit. When the 21k protein is expressed alone, it forms a homodimer that cannot readily be dissociated; however, when the 21k protein (or the 28k protein, although it is very poorly expressed in E. coli) is co-expressed with the 80k protein, the active calpain heterodimer is formed in preference to the possible 21k homodimer. The heterodimer also dissociates in response to Ca2 ,23 but the 21k homodimer does not. In contrast, efforts have been made to prepare and crystallize heterodimers of domain IV plus domain VI, but this heterodimer was not tightly associated, and re-equilibrated rapidly even in the absence of Ca2 to mixtures of the IV/VI heterodimer along with the two possible domain IV and domain VI homodimers (data not shown). Patch 2 of the interface is an artefact produced by the C-terminal truncation, but it is highly complementary to patch 1, which is a naturally existing surface (Figs. 5 and 6). Of the residues that compose this interface, 36% are charged, 22% are polar, and 42% are non-polar. The interface has a surface complementarity of 0.71 (calculated using the program Sc,24 where a value of 1 signifies two protein partners with a perfect 3-dimensional match). This is only slightly lower than the value of 0.73 value calculated for the 21k homodimer, and most protein interfaces have Sc values in the range of 0.70 to 0.76.24 The corresponding removal of EF-5 in both ALG-2 and peflin destabilizes these proteins and disrupts their ability to dimerize.11 This C-terminal truncation does not, however, generate a site corresponding to patch 2 in the 18k protein, because of sequence differences. Residues 134 ­140 of the intact calpain small subunit (28k), which are a major part of patch 2 in the 18k protein (Table II), are not present in PEF proteins when the sequences are appropriately aligned.25 Consequently, PEF proteins such as ALG-2 and peflin are not able to form oligomers similar to that formed by the 18k protein. As shown experimentally,13,14 the 18k protein clearly is not able to form active heterodimers with the 80k large subunit. An 18k protein hypothetically bound to patch 1 on domain IV of the large subunit could not form the additional contact to the N-terminus of the large subunit, which is observed in the circular arrangement of domains in normal calpain. However, patch 1 has been shown in this study to be capable of protein/protein interaction, and it could conceivably interact with potential modulators and inhibitors of calpain in vivo. Interestingly, though the

protein does not form active calpain when co-expressed in E. coli with the large subunit.13 These results were intriguing since the residues 246 ­ 270 that had been removed to make the 18k protein were known to form the binding interface in the homodimer of 21k.4,5 In their absence, since the 18k protein continues to form homodimers, it appeared that an alternative surface was involved in subunit binding. Structure and Association Properties The crystal structure of the 18k protein with bound Cd2 was solved (Table I), revealing two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2). The main chain RMSD between these two molecules is 0.7 Å. The structure of each molecule of the 18k protein employs the same fold as that of the high-Ca2 -bound form of the 21k protein4 with the omission of the final loop and helix of domain VI due to the truncation [Fig. 3A]. There is an RMSD of 1.2 Å between the main chain of 18k-Cd2 and of the first 159 residues of 21k-Ca2 . The remaining four EF-hands in 18k bind Cd2 , which was required for crystallisation, in the same coordination as that displayed by Ca2 in the 21k protein [Fig. 3B]. Crystals could not be obtained in the presence of Ca2 . The interface between the two 18k proteins differs, however, from the contact region in the 21k homodimer4,5 and is asymmetrical in nature (Fig. 4). The buried contact surface of one 18k monomer (patch 1) consists of residues in helix-2, the loop region between helix-2 and helix-3, the end of helix-4 and the start of EF-3. This region is present and exposed to solvent both in the isolated 21k homodimer and in domains IV and VI of calpain. The other contact surface of the 18k molecule (patch 2) includes helix-3, the beginning of the EF-2 loop, helix-6, and all of helix-7 (see Table II for contact residues), and has been exposed as a

overall folding of the truncated EF-hand domain is nearly identical to those of intact domain IV or VI, the largest structure difference is seen in the area of patch 1. In the human calpain structure,7 many residues of patch 1 have high temperature factor. Furthermore, the corresponding residues in rat calpain structure6 could not even be located due to weak electron density. These observations evidently indicate that patch 1 is highly dynamic and flexible, properties commonly associated with protein interactions. The in vivo regulation of calpain remains obscure, but potential protein activators of calpain have been identified,26,27 and in addition to the known calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, Gas228 has been identified as a calpain inhibitor. Since it has not so far been possible to crystallize intact calpain in the presence of Ca2 , or to crystallize calpain/
