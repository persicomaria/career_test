Study of Electrostatic Potential Surface Distribution of Wild-Type Plastocyanin Synechocystis Solution Structure Determined by Homonuclear NMR

Abstract: Plastocyanin is a small ( 10 kDa), type I blue copper protein that works as an electron donor to photosystem I from cytochrome f in both chloroplast systems and in some strains of cyanobacteria. Comparative studies of the kinetic mechanisms of plastocyanins in different organisms show that the electron transfer from photosystem I happens by simple collision in cyanobacteria but through a intermediate transition complex in green algae and superior plants. Previous work has proved that this effect cannot be explained by structural variations across the different plastocyanins but it can be explained by differences in the electrostatic potential distribution at the protein surface. In that case, minor conformational errors at the amino acid side chain level may imply an important effect in the electrostatic potential distribution calculation. In this work we present a high resolution study of side chain conformation by homonuclear NMR for the reduced wild-type plastocyanin Synechocystis using intensity ratios for 2D-NOESY and 2D-H,H-TOCSY cross peaks at different mixing times. We also present the corresponding comparison with different plastocyanin structures and the effect in the electrostatic potential distribution at the protein surface. We discuss the importance of indirect J-coupling information from TOCSY-type experiments as complement for intraresidue distances derived from NOESY experiments in the determination of side chain orientation and stereo-specific assignments. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Plastocyanin (Pc) is a small ( 10 kDa) type I blue copper protein found in oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, namely higher plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria.1,2 Pc works as a mobile redox carrier transferring electrons from cytochrome b6 f complex to the photo-oxidized chlorophyll molecule

bic core. The copper atom is coordinated to four residues (two histidines, one cystein, and one methionine) well conserved across the Pc family forming a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. Comparative studies of the kinetic mechanisms of Pc's in different organisms2 show that the electron transfer from photosystem I happens by simple collisional reaction in cyanobacteria but through an intermediate transition electrostatic complex in green algae and superior plants. Previous structural studies done on Pc from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis indicate that this difference in mechanisms cannot be explained by structural and conformational variations between superior plant Pc's and Synechocystis Pc.11 On the other hand, internal dynamics studies on different Pc's have been reported and no direct correlation between the differences in mechanisms and the internal mobility has been found.12 Moreover, the electronic transfer between Pc and the photosystem I in eukariotic organisms takes place in an intermediate complex formed by electrostatic interactions between two differently charged molecules.2,13 For prokariotic Pc's, this intermediate complex is not observed, indicating a collision kinetic mechanism. It has been suggested that electrostatic potential distribution differences at the surface of the protein can explain the reaction mechanism differences between prokariotic and eukariotic organisms in Pc. In that case, local conformational changes at the amino acid side chain level may have an important effect in that electrostatic potential distribution, and, therefore, could explain the differences in kinetic reaction mechanism. Although structures for Pc's in other cyanobacteria have been reported,14 most of them have been solved in a crystallographic phase. However, kinetic reaction mechanism differences in Pc's would be better explained by structural studies in solution than those in solid state. In particular, solvent-exposed residues will show significant differences in side chain conformations between crystal and solution structures. On the other hand, the three-dimensional structure of Pc from Synechocystis already has been determined by homology modeling theoretical calculations and in large part confirmed by NMR experimental data from hydrogen bonds, chemical shift indexing, secondary structure determination, and side-chain orientation.11 The structures of some minor mutants have been determined experimentally.7,15 However, in the case of an electrostatic potential distribution study, none of the solution NMR structures reported to date present the adequate degree of precision for the side chain conformation of solvent-exposed residues. In many cases, stereo-specific assignments, side chain orientation, and values of 1 can be fixed by a large amount of

NOEs involving the H 2 and H 3 nuclei using different approaches and algorithms like GLOMSA16 or HYPER.17 On the other hand, the amount of NOEs required for those methods to work can usually be achieved only in the core residues that are involved in more interactions with other nuclei than solvent-exposed residues. As a consequence, experimental methods for reliable side chain conformation determination are required in studies of electrostatic potential distribution on protein surfaces. Stereo-specific assignments and most preferred conformations gauche , gauche , and trans (g , g , and t, respectively) can be distinguished in a qualitative manner using relative intensities of H -H cross peaks in D2O TOCSY and NOESY spectra at short mixing times.11,18 This method for side chain conformation determination is independent of residue location, and, therefore, preferred over other methods dependent on disponibility of NOE data. In this article we present a complete homonuclear NMR structure determination of wild-type Pc from Synechocystis in solution (PDB code 1M9W) with special focus on side chain conformations for better calculation of electrostatic potential distribution in the protein surface. In order to elucidate the different kinetic mechanism of Pc in cyanobacteria, the differences in the electrostatic potential distribution among different Pc Synechocystis models and other superior plant Pc structures have been analyzed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials and Sample Preparation
Pc was isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and purified as described in previous work.20 Purified Pc had an A275/A597 ratio of 2.2. Samples for homonuclear 2D-NMR were 4 mM in protein. Two samples were prepared for NMR experiments in 0.5 mM tricineKOH with 5% D2O (H2O sample) and 100% D2O (D2O sample), respectively, and pH of 5.4. Cu2 in Pc was reduced to Cu with sodium dithionite in excess under argon atmosphere and the tube was sealed with a rubber septum.

NMR Spectroscopy Data Acquisition and Processing
NMR experiments were collected on Bruker AVANCE and Varian UNITY spectrometers operating at 600 and 400 MHz proton Larmor frequencies, respectively. Data acquisition and processing were performed using the standard software packages provided by the spectrometer manufacturers (XWINNMR and VNMR).

Monleon and Celda ´ obtained on the basis of 3J coupling constant ratios as derived from H /H short mixing time (15 ms) TOCSY cross-peak intensity ratios and intra- and inter-residue distances, involving HN, H , and H protons as derived from NOESY spectra.11,18 Based on this qualitative analysis, preliminary stereo-specific assignments were obtained for 18 nondegenerate -methylene pairs. When 3J 2/3J 3 2 or 3J 2/3J 3 0.5,11,18 a preferred rotamer position of a side chain was selected among g , g or t. The combination of I 2 and I 3 values as well as intra- and inter-residue NOE short mixing time (50 ms) intensities allowed the identification of the -methylene prochirality. In the cases where 0.5 I 2/I 3 2 (or 0.5 3J 2/3J 3 2) two different configurational situations can be expected. When both 3J coupling constants had values of 5 to 9 Hz, indicative of fast motional averaging, a mixture of rotamer populations about the C OC bond was assumed and neither stereo-specific assignments nor 1 torsion angles could be decided. In cases, where both 3J coupling constant values were lower than 5 Hz and almost equal, a unique rotamer g could be assumed, which could be corroborated with NOE intensity values. Values of 1 of 60, 60, and 180° were chosen for g , g , and t side chain conformations, respectively. Restraints were introduced in the calculations with a tolerance of 30° to avoid excessive restriction for side chain orientation. Hydrogen bond restraints were extracted from comparative analysis of spectra in D2O and H2O and evaluation of protected exchangeable protons.11

2D 1H homonuclear DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments were acquired at 293, 303, and 313 K in phase-sensitive TPPI mode. Water suppression was achieved by the use of WATERGATE21 sequence at 600 MHz and by water signal presaturation at 400 MHz. The values for the spin-lock time in TOCSY experiments were 15, 30, 60, and 90 ms, while mixing times used in the NOESY experiments were 50 and 150 ms at 600 MHz and 50, 90, 150, and 225 ms at 400 MHz. Recycling delay ranged from 600 to 900 ms, giving a total recycling time of 1.2 to 1.5 s. Number of t1 increments of 256 to 512 were used for all the 2D experiments. Standard processing macros designed for semiautomated frequency signal deconvolution were used in the zero-filling, linear prediction, apodization, and Fourier transformations required in each case.

Peak Assignment and Structural Constraints Determination
SPARKY22 was used for the analysis of all the 2D spectra and for integration of NOESY cross-peaks. Sequential resonance assignment of 90% of all possible assignable protons in Pc Synechocystis, as well as hydrogen bond restraints determination, were described in previous published work.11 The volumes of assigned NOESY cross-peaks were classified as weak, medium, or strong using standard calibration and a 1/r6 distance dependency. Upper distance limit restraints of 3.00, 4.00, and 5.00 Å for strong, medium, and weak NOEs between assigned generic protons, respectively, were derived. In the case of methyl groups, additional standard corrections25,26 were applied to the corresponding upper distance limit. A total of 39 dihedral angle constraints for angles were derived by analysis of hyperfine structure of HN-H DQFCOSY cross-peaks and the relative intensities of the intraand inter-residue HN-H NOESY cross-peaks as measured in the NOESY spectra at short mixing time.24 Ranges of 130 to 45° were used to constrain residues in the A and B regions of the Ramachandran plot. Peptide bonds of all residues were imposed to be trans but residues Pro18 and Pro38 were imposed to be cis. These residues were observed to remain in cis conformation in all the structures reported for Pc's. Moreover, cis conformation was confirmed for Pro18 and Pro38 by NMR data in the NOESY spectra. Relative intensities of HNi 1-H 1 NOESY cross-peaks indicate a cis conformation for prolines 18 and 38 but a t conformation for prolines 76 and 85. Observation of HNi 1-H i 1 NOESY cross-peaks for Pro18 and Pro38 is additional confirmation of the cis conformation of these residues. The copper ion was introduced in the structure refinement calculation using CONGEN standard protocols as described below. Copper distance restraints were not confirmed experimentally. However, nontypical chemical shift values were found for those residues located in the hypothetical copper coordination site, indicating a special magnetic situation.11 Side chain torsion angle restraints and stereo-specific assignments of prochiral -methylene protons were initially

Structure Calculations and Electrostatic Potential Determination
Models of Pc were calculated by distance geometry calculations carried out using DIANA.23 One thousand conformers were generated in a random fashion and 800 steps of optimization were applied to adapt their conformation to an initial subset of nondegenerated structural constraints derived from NMR data. Best 20 conformers were selected for further NOESY assignment and recalibration using the ASNO routine implemented in the DIANA package. The new set of expanded structural restraints was introduced in a new cycle of DIANA simulated annealing torsion angle dynamics calculations for new conformer generation. The overall routine calculation-recalibration was applied until no new distance constraint was derived from NOEs. Twenty conformers with lowest values of target function were selected for further full potential energy function refinement with the CONGEN molecular dynamics program. Customized CONGEN protocols for simulated annealing, including stages of weight annealing and temperature annealing, were used for structure refinement.27 Best overall model of Pc Synechocystis structure calculation was selected for electrostatic potential distribution plot on the protein surface using the corresponding modules of MOLMOL program.28 Solvent accessibility was calculated with PROCHECK and residues with accessibility values larger than 0.5 were chosen as solvent-exposed residues.

using the program HYPER17 on the basis of additional intra- and sequential NOEs. Overall, 29 out of 49 nondegenerate H hydrogens were stereo-specifically assigned. In general, this amount of stereospecific assignment is higher that that reported for other NMR structures of other Pc's, including those found by GLOMSA analysis in Synechocystis mutant E98D.15 All additional stereo-specific assignments derived by the use of HYPER were located in the hydrophobic core of the protein and were determined with only NOE information.

"Contact" was the method selected for protein surface determination, which was colored using a GRASP standard criterion. Electrostatic potential calculation was performed using the standard MOLMOL macro for this purpose based on simple Coulomb interaction. Atom charges and protonation states of amino acids were derived with the "pdb_charge" MOLMOL macro with adequate corrections for secondary structure conformations by interpolation for a pH of 6.29,30

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION NMR Signal Assignment
The 1H-NMR signals of all residues were almost completely assigned using standard methods for sequential assignments in homo-nuclear spectra described by Wuthrich19,25 and comparative analysis of ¨ all spectra collected. All backbone proton chemical shifts were assigned. The obtained assignments confirmed, and extend with additional stereo-specific assignments, those previously reported.11,15 The full 1H assignments achieved in this work can be accessed at the BioMagnetic Resonance Databank (BMRB; entry 6249). Some stereo-stereospecific assignments were obtained on the basis of NOEs distances and 3J coupling constant ratios. Specifically, 18 assignments were obtained by empirical analysis of H,H-TOCSY at 15 ms of mixing time in D2O and 2D-NOESY at 50 ms of mixing time. Those assignments were confirmed and extended in 11 additional assignments

nates are in good agreement with those expected from S2 values and dynamic properties reported for the mutant E98D.12 A ribbon diagram of the best energy structure of reduced Pc from Synechocystis is shown in Figure 1 (B). As an example, some well-defined solvent-exposed side-chains have been plotted in the same diagram to show the effect of stereo-specific assignment in the calculations. It is particularly significant that some of these residues are located in the hydrophobic patch present in most Pc's. A low dispersion in the side chain orientation of these residues may indicate some relevant structural role in the formation of the hydrophobic patch for these particular side chains (for example, Phe16, Trp31, Phe73). The overall fold of the protein is very similar to other Pc structures. A typical -barrel fold formed by extended -sheets connected by interstrand loops is conserved. The elements of secondary structure are in good agreement with those found in the x-ray structure of a triple mutant7 (PDB 1PCS) and are very similar to those of other Pc structures. Additional -helical segments are observed in residues 51 to 55 and 86 to 89 for 65 and 80% of the models, respectively. These segments have been observed also in the structure of some mutants of Pc from Synechocystis.7,15 A comparison between the backbone configuration of the different mutants of Pc Synechocystis and the wildtype can be seen in Figure 1 (C). RMSD values for all backbone atoms of wild-type structure versus triple mutant7 (PDB code 1PCS) and E98D mutant15 (PDB code 1J5C) are 1.27 and 1.51 Å, respectively.

Dispersion in side chain orientation for solventexposed residues has been computed and compared with that for previously reported NMR structure for the mutant E98D. Results are gathered in Table III. Good agreement in side chain orientation has been observed for solvent-protected residues in the hydrophobic core of the wild-type protein with respect equivalent residues in the E98D mutant structure (not shown). However, without the experimental information obtained for stereo-specificity, the side chain conformation of solvent-exposed residues cannot be restrained to a particular orientation. The lack of intramolecular long range NOEs for solvent-exposed residues results in conformational dispersion that cannot be unambiguously attributed to side chain mobility. The determination of side chain orientation through evaluation of 3J coupling constant ratios and intraresidue NOE intensities has been used to distinguish real flexible and mobile situations from insufficient structural restraint situations. For example, NOEs for Glu28 are not sufficient for restraining the side chain to a defined orientation and therefore dispersion is very high (Table III, column on the left). However, with the additional information of 3J ratios from H,H-TOCSY, stereo specific assignment can be made and a single orientation can be established for the side chain (Table III, column on the right). That is also the case for residues Ser68, Ser71, Glu75, Cys83, and Asp98. Cys83 is a very critical case because of the proximity of this residue to Tyr82, which is implicated in the electron transfer. Moreover, S of

Cys83 is coordinated to the copper atom. However, NOE information does not provide enough structural information to restrict the side chain orientation to one rotamer position. H /H TOCSY cross-peak intensity ratio together with H /H NOE cross-peak intensities support a preferred t orientation for this side chain. Therefore, indirect information about 3J coupling constant ratios extracted from short mixing time TOCSY cross-peak intensity ratios helped us to better define conformational situations where only NOE information is not enough to fix a preferred rotamer position. In general, lower dispersion values and better order parameters are observed for those residues whose 3J coupling constants ratio has been determined.

Electrostatic Potential
Electrostatic potential distribution on Pc of eukariotic organisms has been reported to be very conserved and to include an important negative patch in the area surrounding amino acid Tyr82. Typically, a "northern" patch formed by residues 44, 45, 56, 60, and 88 and a "southern" patch formed by residues 59, 60, 61, 83, and 93 have been reported for all eukariotic Pc structures. Figure 2 shows the electrostatic potential

distribution at the contact surface of different Pc structures, indicating some significantly important side chains. Potential distribution of structures of Pc Poplar (as representative of eukariotic Pc's, PDB code 7PCY), triple mutant of Pc Synechocystys solved by X-ray (PDB code 1PCS), mutant E98D of Pc Synechocystis solved by NMR without solvent-exposed side chain conformation restraints (PDB code 1J5C), and wild-type Pc Synechocystis reported in this article (PDB code 1M9W) have been calculated and plotted in a GRASP color code on the contact surface of the protein as determined with MOLMOL. Electrostatic potential distribution in photosystem 1 in the side interacting with Pc has been assumed to be electrostatically complementary to the front view of Pc Poplar electrostatic potential distribution showed in Figure 2(A).13 The three structures of Pc Synechocystis show the replacement of the typical negative southern patch in eukariotics for a neutral or slightly positive patch surrounding Tyr82. Side chain conformation of Tyr82 is strongly conserved in Pc's, and it has been shown to have an important role in the electronic transfer from photosystem I. The presence of positive residues Lys55, Lys59, and Arg87 (residues Ser56, Glu60, and Glu85 in Pc Poplar) is responsible for the partial

compensation of the conserved negative residues forming the negative area. Only Lys59 of these three residues is mostly exposed to the solvent. The side chain conformation of Lys59 has been determined to be t, which is the only configuration possible for internal compensation, as can be seen in the triple mutant structure solved by x-ray diffraction. However, the NMR structure of the mutant E98D shows a configuration dispersed between g and t and an extended configuration that produces a positive patch in this area. Overall, the small differences found in side chain orientation, and, indirectly in electrostatic potential distribution at the protein surface, could be related to the observed mechanism for the electron transfer reaction. Other slight differences can be observed in side chain orientations among the three different structures for Synechocystis, but the effect on electrostatic potential distribution seems to be internally compensated for to give a generally neutral surface. The northern patch and the copper coordination region apparently conserve the electrostatic potential distribution typical of eukariotic organisms. A global negative character is observed in all the northern patches due mainly to the high conservation of acidic residues in that part of the amino acid sequence, with respect to other eukariotic Pc's, and the very well-defined side chain orientation of residues Glu17, Cys83, and Ser71.

CONCLUSIONS
Structural studies have been performed on the wildtype reduced Pc from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and side chain orientation of solvent-exposed residues have been determined for a better understanding of electrostatic potential distribution at the protein surface. The overall folding and structure are almost identical to that previously reported for several mutants of the same protein. This analysis has revealed that differences in side chain orientation could indirectly be very important for better determination of electrostatic potential values at the protein surface. Despite the fact that global electrostatic potential distribution seems to be quite similar in structures calculated with and without stereo-specific assignment information, small differences in side chain orientation for certain residues seem to produce different charge compensation at the southern patch of the protein.
