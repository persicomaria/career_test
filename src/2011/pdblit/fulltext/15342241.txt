HEXOSE METABOLISM IN PANCREATIC ISLETS: ENZYME-TO-ENZYME TUNNELLING OF HEXOSE 6-PHOSPHATES
WILLY J. MALAISSE* and HAKAN BDDUR Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Brussels Free University, 115 Boulevard de Waterloo, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium [Tel. (02) 538~04-SO]

(Received 13 December 1990) Abstract-The fate of unlabelled D-glucose and D-[2-`HIglucose in pancreatic islets was simulated taking into account experimental values for glycolytic flux, intracellular concentration of D-glucose 6-phosphate and phosphoglucoisomerase activity. The model, which also takes into account the isotopic discrimination in velocity and intramolecular transfer of tritium between D-[2-`H]gh~cose 6-phosphate and D-[l3H]fructose 6-phosphate in the reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucoisomerase, revealed that the predicted generation of )HOH from D-[2-3H]glucose was much higher than the true experimental value. Such a discrepancy is reinforced by the consideration that the generation of 3HOH from D-[2-`H]glucose in islet cells is not solely attributable to the phosphoglucoisomerase-catalyzed detritiation of hexose 6-phosphates metabolized in the glycolytic pathway. In order to reconcile experimental and theoretical values for )HOH production, it was found necessary to postulate enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling of hexose B-phosphates in the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase sequence. It is proposed that such a tunnelling may favour the anomeric specificity of D-glucose metabolism in islet cells, by restricting the anomerization of hexose 6-phosphates

INTRODUCTION

The metabolism

of D-glucose in pancreatic

islet cells

coincides with their glucose-sensing device (Malaisse, 1987). Virtually each step in such a metabolism, from the transport of the hexose across the plasma membrane to the oxidation of acetyl residues in the Krebs cycle, are now known to be both tightly regulated under physiological conditions and perturbed in pathological situations (Malaisse, 1988a,b). The present study, which is based mainly on the fate of D-[Z3H]glucose in pancreatic islets, draws attention to a further potential regulatory site in the glycolytic cascade (Malaisse et al., 1982), namely the enzymeto-enzyme tunnelling (Srere, 1987) of hexose 6-phosphates in islet cells.
METHODS The experimental values on which the present work is based were previously collected in pancreatic islets removed from fed rats, as indicated below in the cited references. All calculations were achieved by algebraic approach. RESULTS Fate of unlabelled

from the generation of `H20 from D-[5-3H]glucose, averages 129 pmol/islet (Sener et al., 1976). The protein content of the islets amounting to 0.82 pg/islet (Malaisse et al., 1976a), the rate of glucose utilization corresponds to 2.62 pmol/min per g protein. The intracellular water space represents 2.33 nl/islet (Malaisse et al., 1976b). Thus, per liter of cellular water, the protein content amounts to about 352 g and the rate of glucose utilization to 922 pmol/min. The steady-state intracellular concentration of G6P in islets exposed to 16.7mM D-glucose is close to 0.6mM (Giroix et al., 1984). In islet crude homogenates, the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase, as measured in the presence of 0.3 mM F6P averages 22 pmol per 60 min and per mg islet protein (Malaisse et al., 1976a). This corresponds to 129 mmol/min per liter of cellular water. The maximal velocity for the generation of either G6P or F6P was then estimated by taking into account both the affinity of the enzyme for each hexose 6-phosphate and the ratio in maximal velocities, as defined in a recent publication (Liemans et al., 1990). The maximal velocity for G6P formation amounted to 494.5 mmol/min per liter of cellular water, and that of F6P formation to 116.6 mmol/min per liter of cellular water. In this system, the Haldane relationship yields, at equilibrium, a G6P/F6P concentration ratio of 2.74 (Liemans et al., 1990). Taking into account these metabolic variables, the steady-state metabolic flows were then calculated. The monodirectional reaction velocities in the reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucoisomerase were computed from the following equation (Mahler and Cordes, 1966): t, =

in which u represents the reaction velocity for the conversion of S (substrate) to P (product), V, the maximal velocity of the same reaction, [S] and [P] the concentrations of the substrate and product, and KS and Kp the Michaelis constant for S and P. Table 1 indicates the steady-state values for the concentration of G6P and F6P, the monodirectional fluxes between the two hexose 6-phosphates and the net glycolytic flux in this mode1 (model 1). The salient feature is that the back-and-forth interconversion of G6P and F6P is about 60 times higher than the net glycolytic flux. Each mean metabolic variable used in our mode1 entails a certain imprecision and the enzymatic activity in intact cells may differ from that measured in islet homogenates. Therefore, arbitrary changes in selected variables were introduced in our model. As shown in Table 1 (models 2 and 3), when the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase was decreased to 20% of the value measured in islet homogenates or when the concentration of G6P was lowered from 0.6mM to 0.2 mM, the back-and-forth interconversion remained 10 times higher, or more, than the net glycolytic flux. Even when both the enzymatic activity and G6P concentration were simultaneously decreased, as just described, the extent of interconversion was still more than 5 times higher than the net glycolytic flux (Table 1, model 4). In order to reach equal values for the back-and-forth interconversion of hexose 6-phosphates and net glycolytic flux, the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase had to be decreased to about 3% of the value measured in islet homogenates or the concentration of G6P had to be lowered from 0.6mM to about 9 PM (Table 1, models 5 and 6). In the latter two theoretical situations, however, the steady state G6P/F6P concentration ratio reached values close to 5.49, well above the equilibrium value of 2.74 or the close-to-equilibrium value of 2.79 found in our initial model. Such abnormally high ratios clearly indicate that the latter two situations are not realistic.
Fate of o-[.i?-3H]ghcose

by phosphoglucoisomerase, as defined in a recent publication (Liemans et al., 1990). Figure 1 illustrates the fate of both unlabelled D-glUCOSC and D-[2-3H]g1ucose in our initial model. The specific radioactivity of the G6P and F6P pool represented, respectively, 8.7 and 2.6% of that of exogenous D-[2-`H]glucose. The ratio of tritiated G6P/F6P (9.38) was more than three times higher than that of the unlabelled esters (2.79). The production of tritiated F-1,6-P, accounted for only 2.6% of the generation of [2-3H]G6P. Table 2 informs on the essential radioisotopic data in our initial model and some of its arbitrary variants. In all cases the specific radioactivity of the hexose 6-phosphates pools was lower than that of extracellular D-glUCOSC. The steady-state ratio between tritiated G6P/F6P was three to four times higher than the corresponding ratio of unlabelled esters. The generation of 3HOH always underestimated the true glycolytic flux. However, the relative extent of such an underestimation never exceeded 19%, the latter value being only close to be reached when the concentration of G6P was arbitrarily fixed to only one third of its experimental value and the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase fixed to only one fifth of its measured velocity in islet homogenates. Even under these extreme conditions, the generation of `HOH remained higher than its true experimental value, as will be documented in the next section of this report.

Some of the models just defined were then used to predict the fate of D-[2-3H]glucose used in tracer amount, i.e. with a labelled/unlabelled ratio sufficiently low to avoid interference of the tritiated hexose with the fate of unlabelled D-glucose. Allowance was made for the isotopic discrimination in reaction velocity and for the partial intramolecular transfer of 3H between the C2 of G6P and C, of F6P in both the forward and backward reaction catalyzed

duction from D-[2-3H]glucose/D-[5-3H]glucose averages 75.8% (Malaisse et al., 1988). In considering the extent of intramolecular tritium transfer in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction, as judged through the comparison of `HOH production from D-[~-~H]glucose and D-[5-3H]gluCOse, several potential factors of error must be underlined. First, the production of `HOH from D-[5`HIglucose somewhat overestimates the true glycolytic flux, since it also induces the generation of D-[2-3H]glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate generated by the pentose phosphate pathway. However, in islets exposed to a high concentration of D-glucose, the fractional contribution of the pentose phosphate pathway to the overall generation of triose phosphates is very low (Giroix et al., 1985). Moreover, over limited periods of observation, the production of `HOH from D-[5-3H]glucose also slightly underestimates the glycolytic flux, since a limited amount of tritiated glycolytic intermediates is present, at the

in pancreatic islets. Flow rates (expressed per min) and pool sizes (indicated in brackets) are shown as pmol/l of islet intracellular water space. For illustrative purpose, the tracer amount of o-[2-3H]glucose is taken as 0.1% of that of unlabelled o-glucose. The production of `HOH is indicated in the dotted rectangles. The fate of D-[2-3H]glucose takes into account both the isotopic discrimination in reaction velocity and intramolecular transfer of 3H between the C, of G6P and C, of F6P. The enzymes are hexokinase and/or glucokinase (HG/GK), phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) and phosphofructokinase (PFK). In this model, the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase corresponds to that measured in islet homogenates. The generation of ' HOH accounts for 97.4% of the rate of D-[2-`H]ghrcose phosphorylation.

outset of incubation, in the islet cells up-stream from the triose phosphate isomerase or, otherwise, enolase level. Second, and most importantly, the generation of `HOH from D-[2-3H]glucose is not solely attributable to the reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucoisomerase. Tritiated water is also generated from D-[2-3H]glucose in many other reactions. For instance, D-[l3H]ribulose-5-phosphate generated from D-[23H]glucose-6-phosphate may, pending appropriate enzymatic diastereomeric specificity, produce `HOH in the phosphoriboisomerase reaction or, otherwise, through the formation of D-[3-3H]fructose-6-phosphate. Likewise, the pentose phosphate pathway also generates the diastereomer of D-[l-3H]fructose-6phosphate which, in islets is largely detritiated in the phosphomannoisomerase reaction or, otherwise, in the further catabolism of its metabolite, [3-3H]pyruvate (Malaisse-Lagae et al., 1989b). Last, [3-`HIpyruvate formed from D-[2-3H]glucose via the phosphoglucoisomerase-catalyzed conversion of D-[~-~H]glucosed-phosphate to D-[l-3H]fructose-6-phosphate may lead to the production of `HOH either in the glutamate pyruvate transamination reaction or in the Krebs cycle through the generation of NAD'H (Manuel y Keenoy, 1990; Sener et al., 1988). It is

obvious, therefore, that the ratio in `HOH production from D-[2-3H]glucose/D-[5-3H]glucose overestimates the true extent of hexose 6-phosphate detritiation in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction. Third, since it was recently proposed that D-glucose undergoes, in islets, futile cycling in the reactions catalyzed by the hexokinase isoenzymes and glucose6-phosphatase (Khan et al., 1989), the production of 3HOH from D-[Z'H]glucose coupled with such a cycling would again cause underestimation of the of D-[l-`H]fructose-1,6_bisphosphate, generation when such a generation is judged from the ratio in )HOH production from D-[2-3H]glucose/D-[53H]glucose. The same remark applies to the generation of glycogen from exogenous D-ghCOSe which indeed takes place in islets, albeit at a very low rate relative to the glycolytic flux (Malaisse et al., 1977). Although these considerations do not exhaust all possible causes of error in assessing the true extent of D-[l-3H]fructose-l,6-bisphosphate generation from D-[2-3H]ghrcose-6-phosphate relative to the net glyolytic flux, it is evident that the majority of these factors, and also the quantitatively most important factors, all lead to an overestimation of the true extent of hexose 6-phosphate detritiation in the pathway of glycolysis. Yet, the models so far considered

and HAKANBODUR The second, unexpected and essential piece of information provided by the model illustrated in Fig. 2 consists in the fact that, even when the back-andforth interconversion of unlabelled hexose 6-phosphates in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction is more than thrice higher than the net glycolytic flux, close to 25% of the molecules of [2-3H]glucose 6phosphate generated at the hexokinase level escape detritiation and are recovered as [ 1-`HIfructose- ,6bisphosphate and its tritiated metabolites. This finding was unexpected since only three back-and-forth interconversions of tritiated ester are required to cause their detritiation to an extent close to 99% (Liemans et al., 1990). At this point, it seems appropriate to underline that the generation of tritiated fructose- 1,6_bisphosphate, even if it were to account for more than 50% of the rate of D-[2-3H]glucose phosphorylation, does not necessarily imply enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling of glycolytic intermediates. For instance, if the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase in intact cells were only to represent about 1.5% of that measured in islet homogenates, a glycolytic flux of 922 pmol/min per liter of intracellular water would still be reached, provided that the steady-state concentration of F6P in the islet cells would be virtually null. In this case the generation of `HOH only accounts for 46.9% of the glycolytic flux and the specific radioactivity of the G6P pool is about four times higher than that of exogenous D-glucose (Fig. 3). With these remarks in mind, the unlikeliness of the model depicted in Fig. 2 is reinforced by the two following considerations. First, the metabolic events considered in this study take place in the cytosolic domain, which corresponds to a volume lower than the total intracellular water space. The true cystolic concentration of phosphoglucoisomerase is thus higher than that used in all our models. Second, and as already mentioned, the true generation of 3HOH in the reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucoisomerase, as associated with and as expressed relative to the utilization of [2-`HIglucose-6-phosphate, is probably lower than the 75.8% value used in our models. These

clearly indicate that, relative to the net glycolytic flux, the production of `HOH from D-[2-3H]ghtcose should be much higher than the experimental reading. There is thus an obvious discrepancy between these models and the factual situation. Further work in this study is aimed at reconciling theoretical and experimental data.
Models without enzyme -to -enzyme tunnelling

It was possible to simulate experimental values for both the glycolytic flux and the conversion of D-[23H]glucose to 3HOH and tritiated F-l, 6-P, by decreasing the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase way below that measured in islet homogenates (Fig. 2). In such a case the G6P/F6P ratio amounted to 3.52 as distinct from the equilibrium value of 2.74. The postulated enzymatic activity represented only 7.6% of its experimental value recorded in islet homogenates. Although these two attributes may raise serious doubts as to the validity of this model, one could object that it cannot be dogmatically ruled out that the enzymatic activity in intact cells is indeed about 13 times lower than that measured in the acellular system. Moreover, the model depicted in Fig. 2 is the sole which simulates the experimental values for the generation of tritiated F-l, 6-P, in the absence of enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling of hexose phosphates. For these reasons, it seems relevant to underline two striking features of this model. First, the steady-state specific radioactivity of the G6P pool was paradoxically higher than that of exogenous D-glucose. Although the ratio between the two latter specific radioactivities only represented 102.5%, the fact that it exceeded unity is attributable to the isotopic discrimination in velocity of the phosphoglucoisomeras-catalyzed reaction. The specific radioactivity of the G6P pool was about 12 times higher in the model depicted in Fig. 2 than in that illustrated in Fig. 1. This dramatic difference should be kept in mind when contemplating the experimental measurement of specific radioactivity in each ester pool in order to decide between distinct models.

two considerations would imply a further decrease in the ratio of enzymatic activity in intact cells relative to cell homogenates in order to account for the uncomplete detritiation of [Z'Hlglucose 6-phosphate in the absence of enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling of glycolytic intermediates.
Enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling of hexose 6-phosphates The discrepancy between the factual and predicted values for `HOH production from D-[2-`H]glucose, as documented in Fig. 1, could be attributable to the enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling of hexose 6-phosphates in the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase sequence. In the next part of the present work, the relative extent of such a channelling was estimated from the mean experimental values previously mentioned. Figure 4 depicts a model in which 42.8% of the G6P generated by the hexokinase isoenzymes was

channelled in the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase sequence, instead of being liberated from the hexokinase as the free ester. The remaining 57.2% of G6P, whether labelled or unlabelled, underwent a metabolic fate similar to that described in our first model. The generation of `HOH now accounted for 75.8% of the rate of D-[2-`H]glucose phosphorylation, as indeed observed in intact islets. The steady-state concentrations of either unlabelled or tritiated hexose 6-phosphates were the same in the model with enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling and in the initial model, as evidenced by the comparison of Figs 1 and 4. Three further features of the model depicted in Fig. 4 merit to be underlined. First, since glycolytic intermediates channelled directly from one enzyme to another are not mixed with the pools of free esters, no isotopic discrimination in reaction velocity was assumed to affect the tunnelling process. Second, in

In this model, the fractional contribution of the non-tunnelled pathway to the net generation of F6P is identical to the activity of free phosphoglucoisomerase relative to that measured in islet homogenates, i.e. 57.2%.

the model illustrated in Fig. 4, the fraction of hexokinase isoenzymes coupled to phosphoglucoisomerase, i.e. 42.8%, did not exceed the cytosolic, as distinct from mitochondria-bound, fraction of these isoenzymes in islet cells (Malaisse-Lagae and Malaisse, 1988). Last, in this model, the fractions of coupled and free phosphoglucoisomerase were assumed to be proportional to the net generation of F6P by the tunnelled and free pathways, respectively. This also applied to the coupling between phosphoglucoisomerase and phosphofructokinase, in the case of both the unlabelled hexose phosphates and the metabolites of D-[2-`H]glucose. Thus, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, it should be duly underlined that, in the lower panel of Fig. 4, the flux of F6P through the coupled phosphofructokinase amounts to 0.394 ~mol/min, the value of 0.209 pmol/min mentioned in the figure only referring to the flux of tritiated F6P. It could be objected that the fractions of coupled and free phosphoglucoisomerase are not necessarily proportional to the net generation of F6P by the tunnelled and free pathways. In further models, it was assumed therefore that the two sets of variable may change independently of one another. Table 3 summarizes the information relative to these alternative models. For each postulated fractional contribution of the free pathway to the overall net generation of F6P, one model proved adequate to simulate the experimental values for glycolytic flux and generation of `HOH and [1-`HIfructose-1,6-bisphosphate from D-[2-3H]glucose. The first and the last columns in Table 3 correspond, respectively, to the models illustrated in Figs 2 and 4. In several respects, the latter model appeared the most satisfactory. First, it did not imply any reduction in the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase relative to that measured in islet homogenates. Second, it yielded a G6P/F6P ratio for the unlabelled esters close to the equilibrium value. Third, it required the lowest activity of phosphofructokinase as judged from the ratio between the generation of fructose-l ,6-bisphosphate by the free pathway and the corresponding concentration of free F6P.

In the series of models listed in Table 3, the theoretical limit, as judged from the generation of tritiated metabolites from D-[2-3H]glucose, corresponds to a net generation of F6P by free phosphoglucoisomerase representing 54.4% of the glycolytic flux, instead of the value of 57.2% used in the model illustrated in Fig. 4. However, close to the former theoretical limit, the activity of free phosphoglucoisomerase would exceed that measured in islet homogenates. The models listed in Table 3, except that shown in the first column, all involve an enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling of hexose 6-phosphates throughout the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase sequence. It could be objected that a more economical situation would consist in the channelling of glycolytic intermediates between only two, rather than three, enzymes. Such a restricted tunnelling is considered in further sections of this report.
Enzyme tunnelling restricted phosphoglucoisomerase couple to the hexokinasel

When the fraction of coupled (or free) phosphoglucoisomerase was assumed to be independent of the relative contribution of the tunnelled (or nontunnelled) pathway to the overall net generation of F6P, a process of tunnelling restricted to two enzymes became mathematically possible. Table 4 provides the data relative to the models in which the tunnelling was restricted to the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase couple. One of these models is also illustrated in Fig. 5. The fractional contribution of free phosphoglucoisomerase to the net generation of F6P ranged, as an independent variable, between the extreme values of 54.4 and 100%. As shown in Table 4, there was a great number of similarities between all models in this series. The percentage of uncoupled phosphoglucoisomerase was always close to 7%. The G6P/F6P concentration ratio was higher than its equilibrium values ranging from 3.17 to 3.50. The specific radioactivity of the G6P pool ranged from a value slightly in excess of that of the precursor exogenous hexose to about 70% of the latter specific radioactivity. As in other series

of models, the G6P/F6P ratio in tritiated esters ranged from about 9 to 15. If it were assumed that the fraction of coupled phosphoglucoisomerase is complementary to its free fraction, the net reaction velocity in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction, relative to the postulated amount of free or coupled enzyme, would be at least 16 times, and up to more than 600 times, higher in the free than coupled enzyme. Taken as a whole, the models listed in Table 4 may appear rather satisfactory, except for the high G6P/F6P ratio and for the just mentioned and farfrom-negligible feature, namely the tremendous difference in catalytic efficiency of the coupled and free phosphoglucoisomerase, respectively.
Enzyme tunnelling restricted to the phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase couple

A tunnelling process restricted to the phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase couple was also

sufficient to simulate the experimental values for glycolytic flux and the generation of `HOH and tritiated fructose-l ,6-bisphosphate from D-[23H]glucose (Table 5). In this series, the fractional contribution of free phosphoglucoisomerase to the net generation of F6P could theoretically range from 100% to less than 0.01%. All F6P could not be generated through the tunnelled pathway, however. Indeed, in such a case, the production of 3HOH would not exceed 46.9% of the rate of D-[~-~H]glucose phosphorylation, well below the experimental value of 75.8%. In the models listed in Table 5, the situation was grossly similar to that of the models listed in Table 4, at least as long as the fractional contribution of free phosphoglucoisomerase to the net generation of F6P accounted for the major part of the glycolytic flux. Thus, under these conditions, the free enzyme represented 5 to 7% of its total activity in islet homogenates and the G6P/F6P ratio was close to 3.3-3.5. The

J. MALAISE HAKAN and BODUR major difference between the two series of models (Table 4 and Table 5) consisted in the higher specific radioactivity of the G6P pool in the models with phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase coupling than in those with hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase tunnelling. A different situation prevailed, however, when the fractional contribution of free phosphoglucoisomerase to the net generation of F6P was decreased to low values. Figure 6 illustrates one of these models, namely the sole one in this series in which the net generation of F6P by free phosphoglucoisomerase relative to total glycolytic flux reached a value (i.e. 2.81%) identical to the free fraction of total enzymatic activity. In this model, the G6P/F6P ratio for the unlabelled esters amounted to 2.79. The specific radioactivity of the G6P pool was almost twice higher (178.2%) than that of the exogenous glucose. The ratio of [2-`HIglucose 6-phosphate/[l-3H]fructose 6phosphate was close to 9.38, more than three times higher than the ratio of the unlabelled esters. Among all the models so far presented in this study, that depicted in Fig. 6 could be considered, in several respects, as the most satisfactory. First, the tunnelling process was restricted to two enzymes. Second, no arbitrary alteration in total phosphoglucoisomerase activity was postulated. Third, the G6P/F6P ratio was close to its equilibrium value. Last, the model required a low activity of phosphofructokinase as judged from the ratio between the generation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the free pathway and the corresponding concentration of F6P. Indeed, such a ratio did not exceed O.l2min-I, which is the lowest value so far encountered in any of our models. As shown in the last column of Table 5, the ratio between fructose- 1,6-bisphosphate generation by the free pathway and F6P concentration could be further reduced. It reached a value as low as 0.42. IO-`.min-`, when the net generation of F6P by free phosphoglucoisomerase represented only 0.01% of the glycolytic flux. However, once the latter percentage was lower than 2.81%, the fraction of free phosphoglucoisomerase exceeded the fractional contribution of the non-tunnelled pathway to the overall glycolytic flux.
Double but separate tunnelling of the hexokinasel phosphoglucoisomerase and phosphoglucoisomerase/ phosphofructokinase couples

We have already noted that the models listed in Tables 4 and 5 are not vastly different from one another as long as the net generation of F6P by free phosphoglucoisomerase accounts for the major fraction of the glycolytic flux. It was surmised, therefore, that models could be designed in which hexose 6phosphates would be tunnelled in part through the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase couple and in part through the phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase couple. Figure 7 illustrates one of these mixed models. It is postulated that 20% of G6P formed at the hexokinase level is tunnelled through the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase couple, whilst another fraction of 20% is tunnelled through the phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase couple. The remaining 60% of G6P are metabolized through free phosphoglucoisomerase.

In this model the fractional contribution of the non-tunnelled pathway to the net generation of F6P is identical to the activity of free phosphoglucoisomerase relative to that measured in islet homogenates, i.e. 2.81%. In models similar to that depicted in Fig. 7, one is dealing with two independent variables, namely the fractional contribution of the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase couple and that of the phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase couple. Within suitable limits, arbitrary values may be assigned to each of these two variables. The tabulation of representative models in this series would then require a separate table for each given value of one of the two variables. We considered that the extensive production of such data would not truly improve the main message of the present report.
DISCUSSION

The present study represents the extension of a recent series of investigations devoted to the interconGlucose -@$j--+G6P~-F6P-.~-.F-1,6-

version of D-[2-3H]ghtcose 6-phosphate and ~-[l-~Hlfructose 6-phosphate in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction (Liemans et al., 1989; Malaisse-Lagae et al., 1989a). When the extent of both isotopic discrimination in velocity and intramolecular `H transfer for each monodirectional isomerization had been established, it became possible to predict the rate of interconversion of the tritiated esters and that of `HOH production in the presence of the purified enzyme (Liemans et al., 1990). It was then calculated that three back-and-forth interconversions of hexose 6-phosphates would be sufficient to cause their 99% detritiation. The number of back-and-forth interconversions of G6P and F6P in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction, relative to net glycolytic flux, is currently assumed to be sufficiently high in intact cells

complete detritiation. Yet, in several cell types, the production of `HOH from D-[2-`H]glucose is about 20-30% lower than the rate of glycolysis, as estimated through the production of `HOH from D-[5-3H]glucose (Malaisse et al., 1988). It is precisely this discrepancy which motivated the present study. Our modelling of the early steps of glycolysis in pancreatic islets indicates that the true generation of `HOH from D-[Z3H]glucose is indeed lower than expected from the interconversion of tritiated esters in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction. Such a discrepancy is even more striking if one takes into account modalities of 3HOH production other than that associated with the metabolism of D-[2`HIglucose in the glycolytic pathway. &n order to reconcile experimental and theoretical values, it was found necessary to postulate either a severe decrease in the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase in intact islet cells, relative to the value measured in islet homogenates, or the enzyme-toenzyme tunnelling of glycolytic intermediates in the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase sequence. The first hypothesis meets, however, with several objections, including an abnormally elevated G6P/F6P ratio. On the contrary, suitable models of enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling, such as those documented in Figs 4 and 6, yielded favourable values for the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase in intact cells, relative to that measured in islet homogenates, for the steady-state G6P/F6P ratio, and for the clearance of the F6P pool by phosphofructokinase. Further work with purified enzymes used in high concentrations is obviously desirable to assess experimentally the validity of our proposal, which could also apply to cells other than pancreatic islet cells. Likewise, the measurement of the specific radioactivity of the G6P and F6P pools in cells exposed to D-[2-3H]glucose might help to select between the various models defined in this study. In preliminary work conducted in rat erythrocytes, such a measurement was found, however, to meet with considerable methodological difficulties. The present modelling is dependent on a great number of variables other than the four main parameters considered in this study, namely the net glycolytic flux, the steady-state concentration of G6P, the activity of phosphoglucoisomerase and the relative extent of hexose 6-phosphates detritiation in the glycolytic pathway. In addition to these variables, our models also depend on the K,,, values of phosphoglucoisomerase for G6P and F6P, the ratio in maximal velocities of the forward and backward reaction, the degree of isotopic discrimination in velocity for each monodirectional reaction, and the extent of intramolecular 3H transfer in the conversion of [2-3H]glucose 6-phosphate to [1-`HIfructose 6phosphate and in the opposite reaction. The values assigned in the present study for each of these variables are derived from prior experimental measurements. If allowance were to be made for the relative precision of each of these measurements, it could be objected, quite rightly, that the present work provides approximate rather than exact information.

The models considered in this report do not exhaust all theoretical possibilities of enzyme-toenzyme channelling. For instance, it is conceivable that a throughout tunnelling in the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase sequence (see Fig. 4) coexists with a channelling restricted to the hexokinase/phosphoglucoisomerase couple and/or the phosphoglucoisomerase/phosphofructokinase couple. In our models, the assumption is made that no isotopic discrimination occurs at the hexokinase (or glucokinase) and phosphofructokinase level. To our knowledge, this was not yet verified, especially in the case of the isotopomer of D-[l-3H]-fructose 6-phosphate generated from D-[2-3H]glucose 6-phosphate. With these reservations in mind, the present work nevertheless suggests that, in pancreatic islets, hexose 6-phosphates may undergo enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling in the early steps of glycolysis. Such a tunnelling would not solely be relevant to the correct interpretation of radioisotopic data. It could also favour the anomeric specificity of hexose metabolism in islet cells by restricting the anomerization of hexose 6-phosphates. We have recently observed that phosphoglucoisomerase displays, in addition to its classical a-stereospecificity towards D-glucose 6-phosphate, strict b-stereospecificity towards D-fructose 6-phosphate (Hallenga et al., 1990). The enzyme-toenzyme tunnelling of glycolytic intermediates could thus favour the provision to phosphofructokinase of its preferred substrate, namely /?-D-fructose 6-phosphate generated from Ct-D-ghCOSe 6-phosphate in the phosphoglucoisomerase reaction. In conclusion, the modelling of hexose 6-phosphates metabolism in the glycolytic pathway of pancreatic islets, with emphasis on the fate of D-[Z3H]glucose, suggests that these glycolytic intermediates might undergo enzyme-to-enzyme tunnelling in the sequence of reactions catalyzed by the hexokinase isoenzymes, phosphoglucoisomerase and phosphofructokinase.
