The atomic structure of the trans isomer of bacteriorhodopsin was determined previously by using a 3D crystal belonging to the space group P622. Here, a structure is reported for another isomer with the 13-cis, 15-syn retinal in a dark-adapted crystal. Structural comparison of the two isomers indicates that retinal isomerization around the C13]C14 and the C15]N bonds is accompanied by noticeable displacements of a few residues in the vicinity of the retinal Schiff base and small re-arrangement of the hydrogen-bonding network in the proton release channel. On the other hand, aromatic residues surrounding the retinal polyene chain were found to scarcely move during the dark/light adaptation. This result suggests that variation in the structural rigidity within the retinal-binding pocket is one of the important factors ensuring the stereospecific isomerization of retinal.

Introduction
Bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a light-driven proton pump found in the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum, contains retinal as the chromophore, which is bound via a protonated Schiff base linkage to the 3-amino group of Lys216.1­3 In the darkadapted (DA) membrane, bacteriorhodopsin takes two conformations that are thermally interconvertible, i.e. one isomer contains all-trans, 15-anti retinal (bRtrans), the other containing 13-cis, 15-syn retinal (bRcis).4­7 Each isomer undergoes a distinct photoreaction but, due to an efficient branching reaction from a photoreaction intermediate of the 13-cis isomer into the trans photocycle, the trans isomer becomes the major component in the light-adapted (LA) state.8­12 A thermal equilibrium between these two isomers is established slowly in the dark and, in the fully dark-adapted state, purple membrane contains a 1:1­1:2 mixture of the trans and the 13-cis isomer.4,13 The isomeric composition in the dark-adapted state as well as in the light-adapted state is influenced by several factors, including the medium pH,14,15 the aggregation state of the

protein,16 the hydration level,17,18 and the hydraulic pressure.19­21 Recent crystallographic studies of the trans photoreaction intermediates have revealed that the photo-isomerization of retinal from the all-trans to the 13-cis, 15-anti configuration is followed by a significant up-tilt of the C12­C14 region of retinal that is coupled with large displacements of residues (Leu93 and Trp182) contacting the C13 methyl group of retinal.22,23 On the other hand, little information has been available as to how much these residues move during the dark adaptation, i.e. during the isomerization of retinal from the all-trans to the 13-cis, 15-syn configuration. By investigating ° neutron diffraction data at 7 A resolution from purple membrane, Dencher et al. have shown that no large structural change is induced during the dark adaptation.24 To elucidate a small structural difference between the two isomers, therefore, one needs to accumulate higher-resolution structural data of the 13-cis isomer. We have previously developed the membrane fusion method to prepare a 3D crystal belonging to the space group P622.25 This crystal is composed of stacked membranes, in each of which the trimeric bacteriorhodopsin-lipid complexes are arranged on a honeycomb lattice.26 It has been shown that bacteriorhodopsin in the P622 crystal undergoes the normal dark/light adaptation; i.e. the darkadapted crystal exhibits an absorption maximum at

Bacteriorhodopsin 13-cis Isomer Crystal Structure

Results
Absorption spectra of the all-trans and the 13-cis isomers Figure 1 shows absorption changes associated with the primary photoreactions of the trans and the 13-cis isomers in the P622 crystal at 100 K. At this low temperature, a dark-adapted crystal exhibited an absorption peak at 568 nm (spectrum 1), which is noticeably blue-shifted as compared to that of a light-adapted crystal (lmaxZ576 nm). As observed for the light-adapted crystal,28 illumination of the dark-adapted crystal with green light (lZ532 nm) caused a large red shift of the absorption spectrum (spectrum 2) and, after illumination with red light (lZ678 nm), the original absorption spectrum was restored. It is noteworthy that the green lightinduced absorption change observed for the darkadapted crystal (spectrum 5) is blue-shifted as compared with that observed for the light-adapted crystal (spectrum 6). This shift can be accounted for by the photoreaction of the 13-cis isomer leading to accumulation of a K-like red-shifted product, which is designated Kcis. The difference spectrum associated with the bRcis-to-Kcis transition (DAcis(l)) could be evaluated by subtracting the contribution of the photoreaction of the trans isomer (i.e. the bRtrans-to-Ktrans transition) from spectrum 5. In the actual calculation of DAcis(l), the retinal composition ratio was varied until DAcis(l) had a reasonable profile in the whole wavelength; i.e. DAcis(l) O0 in the long wavelength region. This procedure allowed us to estimate an upper limit of the contribution of bRtrans (spectrum 3) to the absorption spectrum of the dark-adapted crystal (spectrum 1). From comparison of these spectra, the content of bRcis in the dark-adapted crystal was estimated to be w60% or higher. Spectrum 4 shows the absorption spectrum of the 13-cis isomer that is calculated when the trans:cis molar ratio in the dark-adapted crystal is assumed to be w40:60. This spectrum (lmax Z562 nm) is very similar to that of the apomembrane reconstituted with 13-cis retinal and cooled to 80 K,10 justifying the above assumption about the isomeric composition. X-radiation-induced absorption changes in a dark-adapted crystal When a dark-adapted crystal at 100 K was exposed to an X-ray flux of 2!1012 photons mmK2 sK1, the absorbance at 568 nm diminished with the increasing exposure time and, instead, the absorption bands at

400­520 nm and at 630­700 nm developed (data not shown). The absorption increase at the long wavelength saturated at an early stage of the X-ray exposure (w2!1014 photons mmK2), while the absorption increase at 450 nm lasted for a much longer period (O3!1015 photons mmK2). This X-radiation-induced absorption change is different from that observed for a light-adapted crystal,28 suggesting that modification of the retinal chromophore by X-rays proceeded differently for the alltrans and the 13-cis isomers. Structural difference between the two isomers contained in the dark-adapted state ° Diffraction data at 2.5 A resolution from a darkadapted crystal at 100 K were collected using an X-ray dose of 3!1015 photons mmK2 per data set (Table 1). This X-ray dose is high enough to cause a significant absorption change. But, no significant peak was detected in a difference electron density map derived from two data sets collected serially from the same crystal. This implies that the X-radiation-induced absorption change accompanies an undetectably small structural change. The P622 crystal was found to shrink slightly during ° ° the dark adaptation (i.e. cZ112.3 A/112.0 A). This

321 small change of the lattice constant made it difficult to detect directly a structural difference between the two isomers. In fact, an F0KF0 difference map derived from the diffraction data of light-adapted and dark-adapted crystals exhibited significant peaks in the solvent region (Figure 2). (It will be shown later that one of these peaks is attributable to binding of sulfate ion near Lys129.) Although positive/negative peaks are seen around the retinal-Lys216 chain (Figure 3(a)), their profiles appeared to be perturbed by the non-isomorphism between the dark-adapted and the light-adapted crystals. To overcome the difficulty in analyzing the F0KF0 difference map, we adopted an alternative procedure to determine the structural difference between the two isomers. Namely, the structure of the isomer with the 13-cis, 15-syn retinal was determined by using the structure factor of the 13-cis isomer alone (FDA-cis), which was evaluated by subtracting the contribution of the trans isomer from the diffraction data of a dark-adapted crystal. When the content of the 13-cis isomer in the darkadapted state is large, this procedure can provide more reliable information about the structural change associated with the interconversion between the two isomers (equation (2) in Materials and Methods). During the model building, an F0K F0 difference map between the 13-cis isomer and the trans photocycle L intermediate (Figure 3(b)) was used as an independent guideline for refinement of the 13-cis, 15-syn configuration of retinal. In Figures 4 and 5, the structure of the 13-cis isomer thus determined is compared with that of the trans isomer in the light-adapted state. (The trans isomer in the dark-adapted state was not analyzed in the present study.) Comparison of the two isomers indicates that residues (Asp85, Thr89 and Leu93) existing in the vicinity of the retinal Schiff base undergo noticeable displacements during the dark adaptation (Figure 4). On the other hand, residues surrounding the polyene chain of retinal (especially Trp86, Trp182 and Trp189) are left essentially unchanged, irrespective of the up-tilt of the retinal C12­C14 region. It is suggested that the region near the Schiff base is relatively more flexible as compared to the rest of the retinal-binding pocket. Another structural difference between the two isomers is seen in the conformation of Arg82; i.e. its side-chain directs toward Glu204 in the 13-cis isomer, whereas it directs toward Tyr57 in the trans isomer (Figure 5). But, as the peptide backbone of Arg82 is immobilized, the guanidinium ion of Arg82 cannot move far enough to make a salt-bridge with Glu194 or Glu204. In both isomers, a water molecule

Spectra 1 and 2 were recorded after the dark-adapted crystal was illuminated for 1 minute with red light (lZ678 nm; w1 mW mmK2) and with green light (lZ532 nm; w0.4 mW mmK2), respectively. Spectrum 3 represents an absorption spectrum of a light-adapted crystal. Spectrum 4 is an absorption spectrum of the 13-cis isomer that was derived by subtracting the contribution of the all-trans isomer (atrans$Atrans(l)) from the spectrum of the dark-adapted crystal (Adark(l)), i.e.: ð1Katrans ÞA13ÿcis ðlÞ Z ðAdark ðlÞKatrans Atrans ðlÞÞ where atrans is the content of the all-trans isomer in the dark-adapted crystal. The absorption spectrum of the trans isomer contained in the dark-adapted state, Atrans(l), was assumed to be identical with the absorption spectrum (Alight(l)) of a light-adapted crystal at 100 K; i.e.: Atrans ðlÞ Z bAlight ðlÞ where b is a normalization factor.

DAdark(l) or DAlight(l) was derived by subtracting an

absorption spectrum recorded after illumination with red light (lZ678 nm) from that recorded after illumination with green light (lZ532 nm). The parameter b$atrans was adjusted until atrans$b$DAlight(l) has the same amplitude as DAdark(l) in the long wavelength region (720­750 nm).

(Wat606) is suggested to mediate interactions between Arg82 and Glu194/Glu204. With respect to water molecules (Wat602, Wat603, Wat604 and Wat605) existing between the Schiff base and Arg82, they undergo small displacements during the light/ dark adaptation. Their movements seem to mediate a coupling between the retinal isomerization and the conformational change of Arg82. On the other hand, a water molecule interacting with the indole nitrogen atom of Trp182 (Wat601), which has a high electron density in both the isomers, scarcely moves during the dark adaptation. In the F0KF0 map between the dark-adapted and the light-adapted states (Figure 2), the largest positive peak is seen in the solvent region near Lys129, where a water molecule was placed in the original structural model of the trans isomer (PDB id 1iw6). Re-investigation of the 2F0KFc map of the trans isomer suggested the possibility that this site is occupied partially by a sulfate ion that interacts with the amino group of Lys129 (data not shown). In this case, the significant increase in the electron density at this site upon dark adaptation can be accounted for by a higher occupancy of sulfate ion in the dark-adapted state. It should be mentioned that the concentration of precipitant (ammonium sulfate) in the mother solution enveloping a single protein crystal increased inevitably during the dark-adaptation for one day. Thus, it is very likely that the structural change observed in the protein­protein contact region took place in a

passive way when anion binding (and presumably cation adsorption) to the protein surface resulted in shrinkage of the crystal along the c axis. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that the head-group of a glycolipid located in the central region of the trimetic structure underwent a significant displacement during the dark adaptation, since this lipid extrudes into the solvent region and interacts with another glycolipid in the adjacent membrane layer (Figure 2).

Discussion
The present result shows that the interconversion between the all-trans and the 13-cis isomers is accompanied by no significant change in the main-chain structure of the protein interior. The rms deviation for Ca positions between the two ° isomers is 0.19 A when several residues in flexible regions (Thr5-Pro8, Gly72-Glu74 and Gly231) are not included in the calculation. This result is consistent with previous spectroscopic data, suggesting that the protein tertiary structure as well as the protein-protein interactions (i.e. the exciton interaction of the retinal transition moments) is not altered significantly during the light/dark adaptation.29 It is consistent also with previous reports concerning the pressuredependence of the isomeric composition in darkadapted purple membrane; i.e. it has been shown

that a volume difference between the trans and the 13-cis isomers is very small (K6wK7 ml molK1), which is attributable to the formation of a few hydrogen bonds.19­21 It has been observed that a significant movement of the polypeptide backbone of Lys216 and the indole ring of Trp182 is induced when the retinalLys216 chain in the M intermediate is modified by an X-ray dose of w5!1015 photons mmK2.27 In contrast to the M intermediate, no significant X-radiation-induced structural change was observed in the dark-adapted crystal. This observation may suggest that while the Lys216 side-chain is fully stretched in the M intermediate, it has a relaxed conformation in the dark-adapted state. But it does not exclude the possibility that the retinal itself was modified configurationally during the

data collection. In such a situation, it is valuable to compare the present result with previous structural data obtained by NMR. Using an advanced NMR technique, Patzelt et al. have observed that the distance between the retinal C14 atom and the ° indole nitrogen atom of Trp86 increases from 3.6 A. ° upon the conversion from the all-trans to to 4.4 A the 13-cis, 15-syn isomer.30 When experimental errors are taken into account, the agreement between the X-ray structure and the NMR data is excellent (Table 2). This coincidence suggests that although the retinal chromophore in bRcis might be modified during the data collection, the position of Trp86 does not change greatly. However, the X-ray structure is less compatible with the NMR structure reported by Griffiths et al., who measured the distances between the retinal C14 and the

nearby carboxyl groups (i.e. Asp85 and Asp212).31 At the present stage, the possibility cannot be excluded that these residues undergo small displacements during the data collection. Figure 6 shows the most likely conformations of the retinal-binding pocket in bRcis and bRtrans. It can be seen that the retinal polyene chain is surrounded by several aromatic residues (Trp86,

Trp138, Trp182, Tyr185 and Trp189) and by the peptide backbone of helix F (Pro186). Since these residues are left essentially unchanged during the dark adaptation, the retinal has a limited motional freedom; i.e. the retinal moiety C1­C11 moves only slightly in the longitudinal direction when the retinal isomerization around both the C13]C14 and C15]N double bonds proceeds.

hand, residues in the vicinity of the retinal Schiff base (Asp85, Thr89 and Leu93) are suggested to be more flexible so that their side-chains undergo noticeable displacements during the dark adaptation. It can be argued that variation in the rigidity within the retinal-binding pocket is one of important factors ensuring the stereospecific isomerization of retinal. It is noteworthy that most aromatic residues surrounding the polyene chain of retinal are conserved in other archeal rhodopsins.32­35 Since photo-induced isomerization around the C13]C14 double bond is a crucial event for their functions, it is suggested that these aromatic residues are absolutely required to fix the retinal polyene chain. In Figure 7, the structure of the 13-cis isomer is compared with those of the all-trans isomer and the L intermediate. A previous crystallographic study of the L intermediate has indicated that the retinal isomerization around the C13]C14 double bond (i.e. from the all-trans, 15-anti to the 13-cis, 15-anti configuration) is accompanied by a pronounced up-tilt of the C12­C14 region that is coupled with a horizontal displacement of Trp182 and a large rotation of the side-chain of Leu93.22 The latter movements create an open space for a water molecule (Wat602) that is dragged up from the extracellular side of the Schiff base in the K-to-L transition. This vertical movement of water has been suggested to be crucial for the proton pumping activity. On the other hand, there is no indication for large-scale re-distribution of water molecules during the dark/light adaptation; e.g. the water molecule (Wat602) that interacts with the retinal Schiff base moves only slightly. It has been reported that the pKa of the purple-toblue transition is lower for the 13-cis isomer than for

the trans isomer; i.e. the neutral purple form of the 13-cis isomer is relatively more stable than that of the trans isomer.36,37 The difference in the thermal stability for the two isomers may be accounted for by a structural difference between the two isomers. Here, it is shown that the guanidinium ion of Arg82 is directed towards Glu204 during the dark adaptation. Our recent crystallographic data of an acid blue form have indicated that the paired structure of Glu194 and Glu204 (i.e. residues comprising the proton release complex) is broken when the purple-to-blue transition is induced by anion binding to the proton-release channel.38 It is natural to suppose that the re-orientation of the guanidinium ion of Arg82 strengthens the paired structure of Glu194 and Glu204 and thereby makes the neutral purple form of the 13-cis isomer more stable as compared to that of the trans isomer. Although a large structural change in the sidechain of Arg82 is also induced upon formation of the M intermediate,27,39­41 the structural change induced during the dark/light adaptation is essentially different from that induced during the trans photocycle. The structural model of the M intermediate generated at room temperature indicates that isomerization of retinal around the double bond (i.e. the C13]C14 bond) is followed by downward movement of the polypeptide backbone of Lys216, which evokes allosteric structural changes in the proton release channel, including a relative sliding motion between helices F and G, disruption of the paired structure of Glu194 and Glu204, formation of a salt-bridge between Arg82 and Glu204, and a horizontal movement of the extracellular half of helix C.27 It is shown here that isomerization around the C13]C14 and the C15]N double bonds during the dark adaptation is accompanied by a small displacement of the

326 polypeptide backbone of Lys216. It appears that the relatively smaller structural change observed during the dark adaptation is ultimately attributable to the flexibility of the side-chain of Lys216, by which a confliction between the 13-cis, 15-syn retinal and its surrounding residues can be absorbed. A similar conclusion has been suggested by a recent crystallographic analysis of Anabaena sensory rhodopsin, in which retinal can take either the all-trans or the 13-cis, 15-syn configuration in the dark.42

Diffraction data were collected using a CCD detector (MarResearch marccd165), with an oscillation range of 18 and an X-ray flux of w4!1013 photons mmK2 per image. Indexing and integration of diffraction spots were carried out with Mosflm 6.1.46 The scaling of data was done using SCALA in the CCP4 program suites.47

Structural refinement of the 13-cis isomer Structural analysis of the dark-adapted state was performed with CNS48 and with XtalView.49 Firstly, the structural model of the trans isomer (PDB id 1iw6) was subjected to a rigid-body refinement and an individual temperature factor refinement. The 2FoKFc map calculated at this stage suggested that the main-chain structure in the protein interior did not alter significantly during the light/dark adaptation. It was suggested, however, that the crystal shrinkage accompanied noticeable conformational changes in the N-terminal region (Thr5-Pro8) and the BC loop (Gly72-Glu74). This implies that we need to abandon the assumption that the trans isomer contained in the dark-adapted state has the same conformation as that found in the light-adapted state. Therefore, the difference between the structure factors for the dark-adapted and the light-adapted states (FDA and FLA, respectively) is given by: FDA KFLA Z ðFDAKcis KFDAKtrans Þð1KaÞ CðFDAKtrans KFLA Þa (1)

Materials and methods
Protein purification and crystallization Purple membrane was isolated from Halobacterium salinarum JW3 and purified according to the established procedure.43 Crystals were grown by the membrane fusion method essentially as described,25 but with slight modifications. Briefly, purple membrane sheets (5 mg mlK1) were vesicularized at 32 8C in the presence of 2.5 mg mlK1 of octylthioglucoside, 1.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.16 M NaCl, 12% (w/v) trehalose, 0.04% (w/v) NaN3 and 0.08 M sodium citrate (pH 5.2).44 The resultant vesicular assemblies of bacteriorhodopsin were concentrated at 10 8C by the sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion method using a reservoir solution containing 1.9­2.0 M ammonium sulfate. Incubation for three to six months yielded hexagonal crystals exhibiting birefringence. For dark adaptation, a single crystal captured in a cryo-loop was sealed in a black-painted plastic container. After the crystal was dark-adapted at 288 K for one day, the cryoloop was separated from the plastic container and then immersed into liquid nitrogen; this operation was done in the dark. Measurements of absorption spectra and absorption kinetics For absorption measurements, the frozen crystal was mounted on a goniometer attached to a microscope and placed in a flow of cold nitrogen gas from a cryostreamer (Oxford CC-12). Absorption changes induced by green light (lZ532 nm, 1 mW mmK2) or red light (lZ678 nm; 4 mW mmK2) were measured using a micro-spectrophotometer, in which monochromatic light from a double monochromator (Shimadzu UV350A) was focused on the frozen crystal by a combination of quartz lenses and two diaphragms in a home-made microscope and the measuring light passing through the crystal was focused again on a pinhole attached before a photomultiplier tube.17 The photocurrent was converted to a voltage signal by a logarithm amplifier (Analog Devices 775P) and then digitalized for data acquisition. X-radiation-induced absorption changes in a darkadapted crystal were measured using an on-line microspectrophotometer constructed at the beamline SPring8-BL44B2.45 Data collection and scaling X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at the beamlines SPring8-BL40B2 and -BL44B2, where a dark-adapted crystal kept at 100 K was exposed to a ° monochromatic X-ray beam at wavelength of 1.0 A with an X-ray flux rate of w2!1012 photons mmK2 sK1.

where FDA-cis and FDA-trans are the structure factors for the 13-cis and the trans isomers, respectively, in the darkadapted state; a is the content of the trans isomer in the dark-adapted state. Equation (1) is derived on the assumption that only the trans isomer is contained in the light-adapted state (i.e. FLAZFLA-trans, where FLA-trans is the structure factor of the trans isomer in the lightadapted state). But, since no reliable information is available as to how much the structure of the trans isomer in the dark adapted state is different from that of the trans isomer in the light-adapted state, the second term in the right-hand side (i.e. FDA-transKFLA-trans) cannot be neglected. If this term is not small, it would cause a large perturbation in the calculation of the difference amplitude (jFDA-cisjKjFDA-transj) from the experimentally available data (i.e. jFDAj-jFLAj); in the worst case, the sign of the difference amplitude would be reversed. In other words, the jFDAj-jFLAj difference map would provide erroneous information about a structural difference between the two isomers, unless the effect of the non-isomorphism is negligible. As a matter of fact, a crystal shrinkage was always induced during the dark adaptation, primarily because of difficulty in controlling the concentration of salt in a mother solution enclosing a single protein crystal for a long period. It was observed occasionally that salt crystals grew during the dark adaptation. Merging diffraction data from dark-adapted crystals having cell dimensions close to those observed for light-adapted crystals was effective for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, but the problem of the non-isomorphism itself was not removed completely. Under such circumstances, we adopted the following procedure for model building of the 13-cis isomer. In brief, the structure factor of the 13-cis isomer alone was evaluated by subtracting the contribution of the trans isomer from the diffraction data of the dark-adapted state:

When a is small, this quantity substantially stands for the structure factor FDA-cis; i.e. the second term in the righthand side would not perturb the phase information of the first term significantly (i.e. FDA-cis), unless the amplitude jFDA-cisj is very small. In the actual evaluation of the structure factor jFDA-cisj, the isomeric composition in the dark-adapted state (i.e. a 40:60 mixture of bRtrans and bRcis) was taken into account. The structure factor FDA-cis thus obtained was used in simulated-annealing refinement of the 13-cis isomer. The statistics of the final refinement is shown in Table 1. Requests for materials should be addressed to T.K. (kouyama@bio.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp). Protein Data Bank accession codes Crystallographic coordinates of the light-adapted and the dark-adapted bacteriorhodopsin have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1iw6 and 1X0s, respectively.
