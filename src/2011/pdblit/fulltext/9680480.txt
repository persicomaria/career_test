Abstract The three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase complexed with the allosteric effector CTP, shows an interaction between the hydroxyl of Thr-82 in the regulatory chain (Thr-82r) with the Q-phosphate of CTP î (R.P. Kosman, J.E. Gouaux, W.N. Lipscomb, Crystal structure of CTP-ligated T state aspartate transcarbamoylase at 2.5 A resolution: implications for aspartate transcarbamoylase mutants and the mechanism of negative cooperativity, Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 15 (1993) 147^176). In order to determine whether the Thr-82r interaction with the Q-phosphate of CTP is important for either binding of the nucleotide effectors or their function, site-specific mutagenesis was employed. The mutant enzyme in which Thr-82r was replaced by Ala had almost the identical maximal observed specific activity as the wildtype enzyme; however, the mutant enzyme had a significantly increased [Asp]0X5 , the aspartate concentration at one-half the maximal observed specific activity, as well as slightly increased homotropic cooperativity. The mutant enzyme was also activated more by ATP and inhibited less by CTP as compared to the wild-type enzyme. In addition, the nucleotide concentration required for one-half maximal effect was increased approx. 3-fold as compared to the corresponding values for the wild-type enzyme. The maximal inhibition of the mutant enzyme, in the presence of UTP and CTP was similar to that observed for the wild-type enzyme; however, higher concentrations of the nucleotides were required to achieve this level of inhibition. The reduced affinity of CTP, UTP and ATP induced by the mutation indicates that the hydrogen bonding interaction between the Q-phosphate of the nucleotide effector and the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-82r is important for the binding of the nucleotide effectors to the allosteric site. Furthermore, this interaction is important for the discrimination between CTP and CDP. Finally, the greater homotropic cooperativity, greater [Asp]0X5 , diminished CTP inhibition and greater ATP activation of the mutant enzyme correlates with the X-ray structure of the mutant enzyme which shows that the unligated enzyme is in an `extreme' T-state. These findings add support to the theory that the global stabilization of the enzyme is critical for both the homotropic and heterotropic properties of aspartate transcarbamoylase. ß 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Aspartate transcarbamoylase catalyzes the committed step of pyrimidine biosynthesis: the formation of N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate from aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate [1,2]. The enzyme is a dodecamer of 310 kDa, comprised of six regulatory chains (17 kDa each), which assemble to form three regulatory dimers, and six catalytic chains (34 kDa each), which assemble to form two catalytic trimers. The enzyme exhibits allostery and demonstrates positive homotropic cooperativity upon binding of the substrate aspartate [3]. The activity of the enzyme is a¡ected heterotropically by binding of the nucleotide e¡ectors ATP and CTP to the regulatory chains. CTP, an end-product of the pyrimidine pathway, induces a decrease in activity and ATP, an end-product of the parallel purine pathway, induces an increase in enzyme activity at subsaturating concentrations of aspartate [3,4]. The enzyme is also subject to synergistic inhibition by UTP in the presence of CTP [5]. ATP binding to the regulatory chains decreases homotropic cooperativity and increases substrate a¤nity whereas CTP binding produces the opposite e¡ects. The heterotropic regulation of aspartate transcarbamoylase is one method in which the amounts of pyrimidines and purines in the cell are kept in balance for nucleic acid synthesis. The enzyme exists in two states that di¡er both functionally and structurally. In the absence of substrates and substrate analogs the enzyme exits in a low-activity, low-a¤nity T state, while the substrates or substrate analogs like N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) convert the enzyme into a high-activity, high-a¤nity R state. X-Ray crystallography [6], sedimentation velocity [7] and X-ray scattering studies [8,9] have shown that the enzyme undergoes a quaternary conformational transition upon the binding of PALA, from the T to the R structural states. Several high resolution X-ray structures of the enzyme in the T and R states are available [6,10^13]. Even though the catalytic and homotropic mechanisms of aspartate transcarbamoylase are reasonably well understood the heterotropic mechanism is still unclear, although several theories have been proposed on how the regulatory signal is propagated î some 60 A from the regulatory to the active sites [9,14^19]. Site-speci¢c mutagenesis has been used to

help elucidate speci¢c residues important for the heterotropic mechanism, such as His-20r, Asp-19r, Lys94r, Lys-60r, Tyr-89r and Arg-96r [20^23]. For example, Lys-60r located on the S3P L-strand hydrogen bonds with the ribose 2P OH of ATP in the R state and with the ribose 2P OH and the O2 of CTP in the T state [12]. The mutant enzyme in which Lys-60r is replaced by alanine demonstrates normal ATP activation but no CTP inhibition. CTP communication is apparently disrupted even though CTP was found to occupy the nucleotide binding pocket. His-20r located on the S1P L-strand normally hydrogen bonds with the Q-phosphate of CTP in the T-state enzyme and does not appear to interact with ATP in the Rstate structure. The mutant enzyme in which His-20r is replaced by alanine exhibits dramatically reduced a¤nity for both ATP and CTP. Furthermore, ATP activates the mutant enzyme in a manner similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, yet CTP is more e¡ective in inhibiting the mutant enzyme. Kosman et al. [10] have identi¢ed a hydrogen bond interaction between the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-82r, located at the terminal portion of the S4P Lstrand, and the Q-phosphate of CTP in the r61 regulatory subunit. In order to determine whether Thr82r is involved in regulation, we have prepared and characterized a mutant enzyme in which Thr-82r is replaced by Ala. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

chased from ICN Biomedicals. Casamino acids, yeast extract and tryptone were obtained from Difco. Antipyrine was purchased from Kodak and diacetyl monoxime was obtained from Fisher Scienti¢c. 2.2. Strains CJ236 [dut-1, ung-1, thi-1, relA-1/pCJ105 (Cmr )] was obtained from T. Kunkel. The M13K07 helper phage, pUC119 and Escherichia coli strain K12 MV1190 [v(lac-proAB), supE, thi, v(sri-recA) 306: :Tn10(tet)r /FP traD36, proAB, lacIq , lacZvM15] were obtained from J. Messing, Rutgers University. 2.3. Site-speci¢c mutagenesis Oligonucleotides used for site-speci¢c mutagenesis and sequencing by the dideoxy method [24] were obtained from Operon Technologies or synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer and puri¢ed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing a Dupont Zorbay Oligo ion-exchange column. Site-speci¢c mutagenesis was performed by the Kunkel method [25,26]. Uracilcontaining single-stranded DNA was obtained by infection of CJ236 containing a phagemid which carried the pyrBI genes with the helper phage M13K07 [27]. The mutations were veri¢ed directly by dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded DNA isolated from several candidates. 2.4. Recloning of the Thr-82rCAla enzyme After the Thr-82rCAla mutation was veri¢ed by dideoxy sequencing [24], a 0.43 kb EcoRI-BglII fragment was isolated and cloned into pEK152 [28] which had the corresponding fragment removed with the same restriction enzymes. The resultant plasmid, pEK233, was 4.95 kb in size. Veri¢cation of the pEK233 construct was accomplished by restriction endonuclease analysis and by dideoxy sequencing of the entire subcloned 0.43 kb EcoRIBglII fragment. 2.5. Wild-type and mutant enzyme overproduction and puri¢cation The wild-type and mutant transcarbamoylases

were isolated from E. coli strain EK1104 [F3 ara, thi, vpro-lac, vpyrB, pyrFÆ , rpsL] [29], containing the plasmids pEK54 and pEK233 which code for the wild-type and the Thr-82rCAla enzymes, respectively. The enzymes were puri¢ed to homogeneity as described by Nowlan and Kantrowitz [29]. 2.6. Aspartate transcarbamoylase assay The enzymic activity of aspartate transcarbamoylase was measured at 25³C by either the colorimetric [30,31] or a pH-stat method [32]. Colorimetric assays were determined at pH 8.3 using 0.05 M Tris-acetate bu¡er or at pH 7.0 using 0.1 M imidazole-acetate bu¡er. The measurements were made in duplicate and the data points in the ¢gures are the average values. pH-stat assays were carried out with a Radiometer TTT80 titrator equipped with an ABU80 autoburet. 2.7. Determination of protein concentration Concentrations of pure wild-type enzyme were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm using the extinction coe¤cient of 0.59 cm2 mg31 [33]. The protein concentrations of the mutant enzymes were determined using the Bio-Rad version of Bradford's dye-binding assay [34] with the wildtype enzyme as standard. 2.8. Data analysis The analysis of steady-state kinetic data was carried out as previously described [35]. Data points were ¢t by a non-linear least-squares procedure to the Hill equation incorporating a term for substrate inhibition when necessary [36]. 2.9. In£uence of the nucleotide e¡ectors The in£uence of the nucleotide e¡ectors was determined by measuring the change in enzymatic activity as a function of nucleotide concentration. In order to determine the maximal e¡ect, the nucleotide saturation curves were ¢t to a hyperbolic function and extrapolated to in¢nite nucleotide concentration. The concentration of nucleotide (NTP) required for half-maximal activation or inhibition ([NTP]0X5 ) was

determined at two aspartate concentrations. The lower aspartate concentration, corresponding to 0.15U[Asp]0X5 , allows the determination of the a¤nity of the nucleotide to essentially the T state of the enzyme, while the higher aspartate concentration, corresponding to 1.25U[Asp]0X5 , allows the determination of the a¤nity of the nucleotide to essentially the R state of the enzyme. These aspartate concentrations were selected because PALA activates substantially the enzyme at 0.15U[Asp]0X5 , but fails to activate the enzyme at 1.25U[Asp]0X5 . The percent inhibition of the enzyme by CTP and CDP at a ¢xed concentration of aspartate was calculated as previously described [16]. 3. Results 3.1. Steady-state kinetics of the mutant enzyme Shown in Fig. 1 are the aspartate saturation curves of the Thr-82rCAla and wild-type enzymes in the absence and presence of ATP and CTP. The curves in the presence of ATP and in the presence of CTP are almost identical for both enzymes. However, the curve for the Thr-82rCAla enzyme in the absence of e¡ectors is substantially shifted and is more similar to the curve observed for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of CTP. Maximal observed speci¢c activities in the presence of CTP, in the presence of ATP and in the absence of e¡ectors for the wild-type and mutant enzymes are nearly equivalent. However, in the absence of e¡ectors the Thr-82rCAla enzyme has a signi¢cantly increased [Asp]0X5 compared to the wild-type enzyme. In fact, the [Asp]0X5 value of the mutant enzyme is intermediate between those obtained for the wild-type enzyme in the absence of e¡ectors and the wild-type enzyme in the presence of CTP. The [Asp]0X5 of the wild-type and mutant enzymes in the presence of CTP or in the presence of ATP are nearly identical (Table 1). The cooperativity as measured by the Hill coe¤cient, in the absence of e¡ectors, is slightly larger for the Thr-82rCAla (2.8 þ 0.1) than for the wildtype enzyme (2.4 þ 0.3). The cooperativity of the Thr-82rCAla enzyme is unchanged in the presence or absence of CTP, while in the presence of ATP, the

Colorimetric assays were carried out in 0.05 M Tris-acetate bu¡er, pH 8.3, at a saturating carbamoyl phosphate concentration (4.8 mM). Speci¢c activity is reported in units of millimoles of carbamoyl aspartate formed per hour per milligram of enzyme.

cooperativity of the Thr-82rCAla enzyme and the wild-type enzyme are similar. 3.2. In£uence of the heterotropic e¡ectors on the wild-type and mutant enzymes Heterotropic e¡ects induced by ATP and CTP on the wild-type and mutant enzymes were assessed both in the T and R states (Table 2). In the case of the T-state Thr-82rCAla enzyme, ATP showed a maximal activation of almost 600% compared to almost 400% for the wild-type enzyme. However, CTP inhibited the Thr-82rCAla less than the wild-type enzyme (Table 2).

The inhibition of the wild-type and mutant enzymes by CTP and CDP is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of aspartate concentration. For the wildtype enzyme, the inhibition by CTP was greatest between 0.2 and 0.4U[Asp]0X5 while at aspartate concentrations greater than 0.4U[Asp]0X5 the inhibition decreased as the aspartate concentration increased. The inhibition of the mutant enzyme by CTP was lowest at 0.2U[Asp]0X5 . The inhibition of the mutant enzyme by CTP steadily increased as aspartate was increased and peaked at approx. 0.4U[Asp]0X5 . At high concentrations of aspartate the inhibition induced by CTP decreased. The inhibition of the wild-type enzyme by CTP is greater than CDP at all measured concentrations of aspartate. However, the inhibition of the mutant enzyme by CTP is lower than CDP at all measured concentrations of aspartate.

The concentration of nucleotide required to either half activate ([ATP]0X5 ) or half inhibit ([CTP]0X5 , [CDP]0X5 ) the T and R states of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes were also determined (Table 3). For the T state, the [ATP]0X5 and [CTP]0X5 were both approx. 3-fold higher for the mutant enzyme as compared to the wild-type enzyme. However, in the case of CDP, the T-state [CDP]0X5 for the mutant and wild-type enzymes were similar. For the R state, the values for [ATP]0X5 , [CTP]0X5 and [CDP]0X5 were approx. 3-fold higher for the mutant enzyme than the corresponding value for the wild-type enzyme. 3.3. In£uence of CTP and UTP on the wild-type and mutant enzymes For the wild-type enzyme the combination of CTP plus UTP inhibits the enzyme more than either nu-

inhibition (Table 4). At the higher concentrations of CTP and UTP, the Thr-82CAla enzyme was inhibited to approximately the same extent as the wildtype enzyme. 4. Discussion In order to further understand the mode of action of the nucleotide e¡ectors we constructed a sitespeci¢c mutant of aspartate transcarbamoylase (Thr-82rCAla) at a residue in the regulatory chain which comprises part of the allosteric e¡ector binding site. Thr-82r is located at the end of the S4P L-strand, which forms part of the allosteric binding pocket. A hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Thr-82r and the Q-phosphate of CTP, in the regulatory subunit R6, was ¢rst observed by Kosman et al. [10] in a crystal structure of the enzyme complexed with CTP. Since the Thr-82rCAla substitution removes the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Thr-82r and the Q-phosphate of CTP, kinetic studies were performed on the Thr-82rCAla enzyme to determine the e¡ect of the mutation on nucleotide a¤nity as well as on the homotropic and heterotropic properties of the enzyme. 4.1. The Thr-82rCAla substitution stabilizes the T state of the enzyme The kinetic parameters of Thr-82rCAla enzyme suggest that the enzyme's ability to catalyze the transcarbamoylase reaction is not substantially alTable 4 In£uence of UTP in the presence of CTP on the activity of the wild-type and Thr-82rCAla enzymesa Enzyme Wild-type Thr-82rCAla

tered by the mutation; however, the signi¢cant shift in the aspartate saturation curve, slightly increased cooperativity, increased ability of ATP to activate the enzyme and lessened ability of CTP to inhibit the enzyme all suggest that the mutant enzyme has a T state which is more stable than that of the wildtype enzyme. In fact, the mutation results in an enzyme that behaves like the wild-type enzyme in the presence of CTP (Fig. 1). This conclusion is reinforced by the results of the experiments in which the activity of wild-type and Thr-82rCAla enzymes were determined in the presence of ATP and CTP at two concentrations of aspartate, 0.15U[Asp]0X5 and 1.25U[Asp]0X5 . The greatest di¡erence in inhibition between the Thr-82rCAla and the wild-type enzymes occurred at the lower aspartate concentration, where the conformational equilibrium favors the T state. Under these conditions, ATP activation was much greater and CTP inhibition was much less than that of the wild-type enzyme. However, at the higher concentration of aspartate, where the conformational equilibrium favors the R state, ATP activation and CTP inhibition of both the wild-type and Thr-82rCAla enzymes were more similar. These results suggest that the di¡erences in heterotropic effects between the wild-type and mutant enzymes are due to a stabilization of the T state of the mutant enzyme with respect to the R state. This would result in a shift in the T = R equilibrium explaining the increased [Asp]0X5 and the greater cooperativity in the absence of e¡ectors observed for the Thr-82rCAla enzyme as compared to the wild-type enzyme. For the wild-type enzyme, the binding of aspartate to the active sites promotes the quaternary transition from the T to the R state. It appears that the aspartate concentration needed to stabilize the Rstate conformation in preference to the T-state conformation is greater for the Thr-82rCAla enzyme as compared to the wild-type enzyme. The similar heterotropic e¡ects of the wild-type and mutant enzymes at the higher aspartate concentration may be explained by the smaller e¡ect ATP and CTP have upon a R-stabilized enzyme. 4.2. Thr-82r is important for discrimination between CDP and CTP CTP maximally inhibits the wild-type enzyme sig-

ni¢cantly more than CDP at all concentrations of aspartate tested (Fig. 2). The enhanced inhibition by CTP as compared to CDP demonstrates that the Q-phosphate of CTP is essential for maximal inhibition of the enzyme and suggests that CTP may stabilize the T-state conformation more e¡ectively than CDP. The Q-phosphate of CTP may be critical for the binding of the e¡ector in the proper orientation, or in promoting protein interactions required for optimal e¡ector response. Crystal structures of the wild-type enzyme have revealed several contacts between the backbone and side-chains of residues Asp-19r, His-20r, and Thr-82r and the Q-phosphate of CTP. These interactions may be all or in part responsible for maximal inhibition by properly orienting the nucleotide in the nucleotide binding site. As opposed to the wild-type enzyme, CDP inhibits the Thr-82rCAla enzyme more than CTP at all concentrations of aspartate tested. This may be due to one or a combination of factors. The absence of the Thr-82r hydroxyl group may cause local perturbations in the e¡ector binding pocket, or global perturbations in the protein, a¡ecting inhibition. The absence of the Q-phosphate in CDP may better optimize protein interactions of the mutant enzyme required to elicit inhibition or may bind and stabilize the Tstate conformation more e¡ectively than CTP. Nevertheless, the lack of the Thr-82r results in loss of the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between CTP and CDP. 4.3. Thr-82r is important for nucleotide a¤nity The replacement of Thr-82r by alanine results in a mutant enzyme that has diminished a¤nity for ATP and CTP (see Table 1). These data suggest that the interaction between the side-chain of Thr-82r and the Q-phosphate of CTP, observed in the X-ray structure of the CTP-liganded enzyme [10], is important for not only the function of the nucleotide but also its a¤nity. The Thr-82rCAla mutation does reduce the synergistic inhibition at concentrations of CTP and UTP which normally induce maximal inhibition of the wild-type enzyme. However, the e¡ects on the mutant enzyme can be inhibited to the same levels by approx. 4-fold higher nucleotide concentrations ¨ (Table 4). England and Herve [37] have reported that the Q-phosphate of CTP is not required to elicit

256

a synergistic response but the Q-phosphate of UTP is crucial. The results from this work indicate that the Thr-82r side-chain is not crucial for the synergistic response. Therefore, it is likely that the synergistic response observed for the mutant and wild-type enzymes are mechanistically similar, and the impaired synergism observed for the mutant enzyme is due to the reduced binding a¤nity of the mutant enzyme. 4.4. Structural consequences of the Thr-82rCAla substitution The structure of the unligated Thr-82rCAla enî zyme has been determined to 2.55 A resolution and re¢ned to a crystallographic residual of 0.175 [38]. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the quaternary structure of the r1 regulatory chain of the mutant enzyme is more similar to that of the r6 regulatory chain so the overall structure is more symmetric. Furthermore, the quaternary structural alteration for the mutant enzyme appears to occur only in the r1 regulatory chain, while the r6 regulatory chain undergoes no quaternary change when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Since the interaction of Thr-82r and CTP occurs only in the r6 chain [10], the structural data suggest that Thr-82r is involved in establishment of the observed asymmetry of the regulatory dimer. The quaternary alterations in the mutant enzyme are accompanied by signi¢cant changes in the subunit interfaces between the regulatory and catalytic chains, as well as in the interface between the allosteric and zinc domains within the regulatory chain. Moreover, the regulatory dimers are rotated around the 2-fold axes approx. 1³ beyond the rotation which occurs in the wild-type T-state enzyme. The structural analysis indicates that the enzyme is an `extreme' T state, in which the larger rotation of the regulatory dimers would be required for the T to R transition than that found for the wild-type [38]. The structural analysis correlates well with the kinetic parameters found for the mutant enzyme showing a stabilized T state. Furthermore, the structural analysis of the mutant enzyme suggests that replacement of the Thr-82r side-chain with Ala substantially alters the local conformation of the nucleotide binding pocket and therefore o¡ers a plausible explanation for the reduced enzyme a¤nity for nucleotides.

4.5. Conclusions In summary, the interaction between the side-chain of Thr-82r and the Q-phosphate of CTP is critical for maximal inhibition of the wild-type enzyme. Removal of either Thr-82r or the Q-phosphate of CTP results in substantially diminished response to the regulatory nucleotide. The reduced a¤nity of CTP, UTP and ATP induced by the mutation indicates that the hydrogen bonding interaction, observed in the crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme in the presence of CTP, between the Q-phosphate of the nucleotide e¡ector and the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-82r is important for the binding of the nucleotide e¡ectors to the allosteric site. Furthermore, this interaction is important for the discrimination between CTP and CDP. Finally, the increase in homotropic cooperativity, greater [Asp]0X5 , diminished CTP inhibition and greater ATP activation than the wild-type enzyme indicate that the side-chain of Thr-82r is important for the global stabilization of the enzyme. When the interactions involving Thr-82r are lost the T state of the enzyme is stabilized in an `extreme' T-state structure. These ¢ndings add support to the theory [19] that the global stabilization of the enzyme is critical for both the homotropic and heterotropic properties of aspartate transcarbamoylase, and that even a single amino acid substitution can alter the stabilization of the T or R states of the enzyme.
