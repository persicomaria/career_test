1. Introduction Scorpion venoms are rich source of fascinating neurotoxins, which bond with high affinity and specificity to various ion channels and thus widely serve as useful tools in probing the protein mapping of ion channels and clarifying the molecular mechanism involved in the signal transduction and channel gating. So far more than 100 peptidyl modulators of ion channels have been separated from various scorpion venoms. According to their primary structures and biological functions the peptides can be classified into four groups: Group 1 contains sodium channel modulators, which are composed of 60­70 amino acids and linked by four disulfide bridges [7]. Group 2 includes potassium channel blockers, which are short-chain peptides composed of 30­40 amino acids and linked by three or

four disulfide bridges [5,14]. Group 3 belongs to chlorine channel inhibitor, they are short-chain insect toxin peptides of 36 amino acids linked by four disulfide bridges [4,21]. Group 4 is classified as calcium channel modulators, which are long-chain peptides linked by four disulfide bridges [22]. Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch is the species belonging to the Buthidae family. It has been used as a Chinese traditional medicine since Song Dynasty and is still used as a drug to treat neurological symptoms such as incomplete paralysis and mimetic paralysis even at the present time. Many toxins from this species have been reported during the past few years, such as the long-chain peptides BmK I, BmK II [10], BmK M8 [15], BmK IT [11] and BmK IT2 [12], and the short-chain peptides BmP01, BmP02, BmP03, BmP05 [18], BmTX1, BmTX2 and BmKTX [17]. In our previous paper a systematical isolation has been achieved and total 45 toxic peptides have been isolated and characterized from the venom of Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch [23]. In present paper, we report purification, characterization and sequence determination of a novel potassium channel blocker BmKK4, which is the first isolated member of a

new subfamily -KTx17 of scorpion K+ toxins, from this species. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sample preparation The scorpion neurotoxin BmKK4 was purified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch by using the procedure of a combination of gel-filtration, ion exchange and reversed phase chromatography as described previously [23]. The final purification was achieved on a reverse-phase HPLC column (C18 column, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 m bead size, Alltech) using a linear gradient from 20 to 45% buffer B (0.1% TFA and 20% H2 O in CH3 CN) in buffer A (0.1% TFA and 10% CH3 CN in H2 O). 2.2. Characterization of the peptide BmKK4 Native BmKK4 was subjected to amino acid composition analysis on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer after acid hydrolysis in 6N HCl under vacuum at 110  C for 20 h. The molecular weight of BmKK4 was measured on a VG Quattro spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source. 2.3. Mass spectrometry analysis MALDI-TOF MS spectrum was acquired using a Voyager Elite DE (PE Biosystems, USA) operated in the reflectron mode with time lag focusing. The 0.5 l of sample was mixed at the ratio of 1:1 with a 4 mg/ml solution of alphacyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CH3 CN:H2 O, 0.1% TFA). ESI MS and ESI MS/MS spectra were performed using a tandem quadrupole-TOF instrument (Micromass, UK). One to two microliters of sample was loaded into a nanospray needle. For the recording of ESI MS/MS spectra the quadrupole was operated as a mass filter and used to select the desired precursor ion isotope cluster. During product ion analysis the resolving quadrupole was set to transmit a ± 2 m/z window around the precursor ion. Precursor ions were directed into a hexapole collision cell. The collision gas was argon and the collision energy was optimized for each analysis. Because of the existences of disulfide bonds in the sequence, the sample of BmKK4 was subjected to DTT reduction and iodoacetic acid derivatization before MS analysis. Ten microliter of a 10 pmol/ l solution of peptide BmKK4 was reduced at 37  C for 30 min by adding 10 l 100 mmol/l ammonium bicarbonate, and 10 mmol/l DTT. Free thiols were alkylated by adding 20 l of 55 mmol/l iodoacetic acid held at room temperature for 45 min in dark. Two pmol of sequencing grade trypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C was added and held at 37  C for 1 h. Samples were desalted into 5 l 4:1 CH3 CN:H2 O, 0.1% formic acid using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, USA).

3. Results 3.1. Sample preparation A pure peptide BmKK4 was obtained from the venom of scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch by the procedure as described previously [23]. Briefly, the soluble venom was initially separated by gel-filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-50, followed by two steps of cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S column and one step of separation on Sephadex G-50. The final step of purification of scorpion peptide BmKK4 on a reverse-phase HPLC column is shown in Fig. 1. 3.2. Characterization of the peptide BmKK4 The ESI mass spectrum of the peptide showed homogeneity of the peptide and a molecular weight of 3460.2 Da (Fig. 2). The results of amino acid composition analysis of BmKK4 were listed in Table 1. To match the calculated and experimental molecular mass, six Cys residues were hypothesized. The discrepancy (17 Da) between the experimental data and the monoisotopic mass calculated according to the amino acid composition in the Table 1 could be attributed to the N-terminal pyroglutamylation, as discussed later.

3.3. The CID MS/MS analysis of enzyme digestion products of BmKK4 The desalted sample of digestion products of reduced and S-alkylated BmKK4 by Trypsin and Lys-C, respectively, were submitted to ESI MS and CID MS/MS analysis. ESI MS spectrum of Trypsin digested mixture of reduced and S-alkylated BmKK4 exhibited three doubly charged ions at m/z 495.89, 729.49 and 601.60, indicating the presence of three segments (denoted as peptide segment T1, T2 and T3, respectively). These precursor ions were then selected for fragmentation in the CID MS/MS analysis. The CID MS spectrum of each precursor ion was shown in Figs. 3­5, respectively. The intact amino acid sequence of the corresponding precursor ion peptide except for 2 N-terminal residues of T1 were obtained straight from the b and y series fragment ions as shown in their spectra. In addition, the ESI-MS spectrum of Lys-C digested mixture of reduced and S-alkylated BmKK4 showed a quadruple charged precursor ion with m/z at 903.62 (denoted as segment L1) which was selected for fragmentation. The amino acid sequence of segment L1 except for 2 N-terminal residues was obtained straightforward by the y series ions in the CID MS/MS spectrum as shown in Fig. 6.

Protein/Peptide Sequence failed, which indicates that the N-terminus of the toxin was enveloped. Therefore, CID MS/MS technique was used to elucidate the primary sequence of BmKK4. Combination of the sequence information derived from the CID MS/MS spectra of segment T1, T2, T3 and L1, it was clear that T1 was located at N-terminal, T3 was located close to the C-terminal, and T2 was the middle region of the peptide as shown in Fig. 7. The connective pattern of the fragments T1, T2 and T3 was deduced from the sequence information of Lys-C digested peptide L1, while the N-terminal and C-terminal of the toxin were left unknown at this stage. The detailed structure of N-terminus of BmKK4 could be resolved by carefully elucidate the CID MS spectra of T1 and L1, where a fragment ion with m/z of 213 was observed (denoted as b2 in both spectra). This mass value was uniquely assigned to a combination of Thr residue and a pyroglutamic acid residue. This deduction was further demonstrated by the presence of the ion b3-H2 O in the CID MS/MS

spectrum of T1, which was generated from the elimination of the side-chain hydroxyl group of the Thr residue. The corresponding precursor ions of T4 and L2 fragments at the C-terminal as shown in Fig. 7 were unable to be detected by Q-TOF instrument due to their low ionization potency. The discrepancy between the monoisotopic mass of the peptide BmKK4 determined by MALDI-TOF MS (3457.38 Da, data not shown) and that (3239.26 Da) of the peptide L1 segment suggested that the remained fragment of the molecule is a combination of Thr-Thr (NH2 ). This deduction was supported by the fact of total five Thr residues presence in the peptide according to the amino acid composition analysis. Therefore, the intact amino acid sequence of the scorpion BmKK4 is listed as follows: ZTQCQ SVRDC QQYCL/I TPDRC SYGTC YCKTT (NH2 ). Database searching by experimentally determined sequence information yielded a hit. A cDNA sequence corresponding to the precursor peptide of QTQCQSV RDCQQ YCLTP DRCSY GTCYC KTTGK was reported by Zeng et al. in 2001 [24]. It was clear that some additional modifications occurred during post-translation. The first was N-terminal pyroglutamylation due to deamidation. The second was cleavage of C-terminal residues Gly-Lys, which was strongly demonstrated by the amidation of the C-terminal residue Thr of the molecule, as the residue Gly being a donor of the amide group required by peptidylglycine -amidation monooxygenase. By using tandem MS/MS, peptides extending up to whole proteins can now be sequenced, and post-translational

modifications can also be identified [9]. Traditional Edman sequencing approach is not suitable for the sequence determination of the peptide with enveloped N-terminus, like BmKK4. The amino acid sequence of BmKK4 was determined by the using of CID MS/MS method followed by database searching. The modifications on the amino acid sequence of the scorpion toxin BmKK4 during post-translation were also revealed by comparison of structural information derived from the tandem MS/MS data and those resulted from the database searching. Taking the advantage of the cDNA database searching, the sequence of the toxin deduced from tandem MS/MS data was not only further verified, but the isobaric residues (for example, residue leucine or isoleucine having the same molecular mass of 113.08 Da at position 15) could also be distinguished. Sequences alignment of BmKK4 with those of other similar short-chain scorpion toxins showed that the amino acid sequence of BmKK4 has a low homology with other known toxins (Fig. 8). According to the newest classification of short-chain scorpion toxins on the basis of their primary structures suggested by Tytgat et al. [8], BmKK4 belongs to a new subfamily -KTx17.
