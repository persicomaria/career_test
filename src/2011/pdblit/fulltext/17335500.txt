· Invertases and fructan exohydrolases (FEHs) fulfil important physiological functions in plants. Sucrose is the typical substrate for invertases and bacterial levansucrases but not for plant FEHs, which are usually inhibited by sucrose. · Here we report on complexes between chicory (Cichorium intybus) 1-FEH IIa with the substrate 1-kestose and the inhibitors sucrose, fructose and 2,5 dideoxy2,5-imino-D-mannitol. Comparisons with other family GH32 and 68 enzymesubstrate complexes revealed that sucrose can bind as a substrate (invertase/ levansucrase) or as an inhibitor (1-FEH IIa). · Sucrose acts as inhibitor because the O2 of the glucose moiety forms an H-linkage with the acid-base catalyst E201, inhibiting catalysis. By contrast, the homologous O3 of the internal fructose in the substrate 1-kestose forms an intramolecular Hlinkage and does not interfere with the catalytic process. Mutagenesis showed that W82 and S101 are important for binding sucrose as inhibitor. · The physiological implications of the essential differences in the active sites of FEHs and invertases/levansucrases are discussed. Sucrose-inhibited FEHs show a Ki (inhibition constant) well below physiological sucrose concentrations and could be rapidly activated under carbon deprivation.

Introduction
Plant fructan exohydrolases (FEHs) degrade fructans, fructosebased polymers found as reserve carbohydrates in c. 20% of flowering plants (Hendry, 1993). These hydrolytic enzymes transfer a terminal fructosyl unit from a fructan to an acceptor water molecule. Sucrose is not a donor substrate, clearly distinguishing these enzymes from invertases that use sucrose as a typical substrate. Recently, different types of FEHs have been fully characterized and cloned: 1-FEHs

degrading inulin-type fructans with -2,1 linkages (Van den Ende et al., 2000, 2001, 2003a); 6-FEHs degrading levan-type fructans with -2,6 linkages (Van den Ende et al., 2003b; De Coninck et al., 2005; Van Riet et al., 2006); 6&1-FEHs that are capable of degrading both inulin- and levan-type fructans (De Coninck et al., 2005) or branched graminan-type fructans (Kawakami et al., 2005). Recently, a highly specialized FEH degrading very specifically the trisaccharide 6-kestose (a 6KEH) was discovered in wheat (Van den Ende et al., 2005). Surprisingly, FEHs were also found in plants that do not

accumulate fructans, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Beta vulgaris. The specific function of FEHs in nonfructan plants remains unclear but they are possibly involved in defence or signalling processes (Van den Ende et al., 2004). Most FEHs are monomeric glycoproteins with an acidic pH optimum. In contrast to microbial exohydrolases, plant FEHs do not efficiently degrade sucrose (Van den Ende et al., 2000, 2001, 2003a,b, 2005; De Coninck et al., 2005; Kawakami et al., 2005; Van Riet et al., 2006). This might be related to the fact that sucrose and fructans are just simple substrates for microorganisms, while for plants sucrose is not only a reserve substance (like fructans) but also the major way of transporting carbon between different plant parts and a signal molecule for different processes. FEHs are believed to be vacuolar enzymes (Wiemken et al., 1995) that fulfil important physiological functions in fructan plants: they rapidly hydrolyse fructan reserves whenever energy supplies are needed (Morvan-Bertrand et al., 2001; Van den Ende et al., 2001); they quickly increase the osmotic pressure (e.g. flower opening; Bieleski, 1993; Vergauwen et al., 2000); they increase oligofructan concentrations under stress (Van Laere & Van den Ende, 2002), putatively contributing to frost tolerance through membrane stabilization (Hincha et al., 2000); and they might trim fructan substrates during the process of fructan biosynthesis in wheat (Van den Ende et al., 2003a). Since FEHs mobilize carbohydrates and carbohydrates are transported as sucrose in most plants, it is not unexpected that many, but not all, FEHs are inhibited by sucrose. For instance, sucrose acts as a strong inhibitor of chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) 1-FEH II (De Roover et al., 1999), but not of chicory 1-FEH I (Claessens et al., 1990; Van den Ende et al., 2000). The Ki (inhibition constant) of 5.9 mM for 1-FEH II (De Roover et al., 1999) is well below the usual physiological sucrose concentration in plant vacuoles (Pollock, 1986). However, sucrose-inhibited FEHs could be immediately activated when sucrose concentrations fall (as a result of damage, wounding, cutting, grazing or other types of stress). Close relationships at the biochemical, molecular and structural levels are found between fructan biosynthesizing and degrading enzymes on the one hand, and invertases on the other. All these enzymes classify within family 32 of the glycoside hydrolases (GH 32; http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY). These enzymes all contain a five-bladed -propeller catalytic domain linked to a -sandwich with unknown function (Alberto et al., 2006). This strongly supports the idea that all fructan enzymes evolved from invertases by relatively few mutational changes (Vijn & Smeekens, 1999). Most probably, FEHs evolved from cell wall-type invertases (Van den Ende et al., 2002). FEHs and cell wall invertases are highly similar yet functionally different enzymes (De Coninck et al., 2005). Plant invertases fulfil crucial roles in sucrose metabolism. Plant carbohydrate partitioning and sugar sensing are intimately connected to sucrose metabolism and these

processes are vital throughout plant development (Koch, 2004). The structure of chicory 1-FEH IIa has previously been described (Verhaest et al., 2005). 1-FEH IIa cleaves terminal fructose moieties by a double displacement mechanism with D22 as nucleophile and E201 as acid-base catalyst. The inulintype trisaccharide 1-kestose is an excellent substrate for this enzyme, while by contrast sucrose is a strong inhibitor (De Roover et al., 1999). It was proposed that the sucrose/1-kestose ratio not only could determine the fructan polymerization in vivo (Van den Ende & Van Laere, 1996; Vergauwen et al., 2003), but could also influence fructan depolymerization by 1-FEH IIa (De Roover et al., 1999; Van den Ende et al., 2001). Here we describe 1-FEH IIa in complex with the substrate 1-kestose and with different inhibitors. The results explain why sucrose acts as an inhibitor and not as a substrate.

Materials and Methods
Mutagenesis, purification, crystallization and data collection The mutants E201Q, W82L and S101L were produced using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Cloning and heterologous expression were as described by De Coninck et al. (2005). The wild-type 1-FEH IIa was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the primers 5 CCG GAA CTT GGC AGT GCC CGG AC-3 (E201Q), 5 GCA AGA GTT GCC TGT CGG GAT CCG 3 (W82L), 5 GTA CAC CGG CCT CGA TTC AAA G 3 (S101L) and the respective complementary reverse primers. Chemically competent E. coli TOP10 cells were transformed with the mutated plasmid and the mutations were verified by sequencing. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified as described previously (Verhaest et al., 2004). The protein solution was concentrated to 10 mg ml-1 by ultrafiltration using a Microcon concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA, USA) with a 3 kDa cutoff. The crystallization was carried out by the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method using Linbro multiwell tissue culture plates (Molecular Dimensions, Suffolk, UK). As the mutant differed by only one amino acid from the active protein, it could be expected that this mutant would crystallize in a similar condition as the native 1-FEH IIa (Verhaest et al., 2004). To test this, a screening was set up, changing only the salt concentration of the native 1-FEH IIa crystallization condition. Nevertheless, the best inactive mutant crystals were grown in the same condition as the native protein, that is, 2.1 M sodium potassium phosphate and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The Linbro multiwell tissue culture plate reservoirs were filled with 700 µl of reservoir solution, while drops consisted of 2 µl protein solution mixed with 1 µl reservoir solution. The drops were placed on cover slips and equilibrated against the reservoir.

A substrate (1-kestose) and several inhibitors (fructose, sucrose and 2,5 dideoxy-2,5-imino-D-mannitol (DIM; Legler et al., 1993)) of the enzyme were added to the crystals by a soaking procedure. The complex of 1-kestose with the inactive mutant E201Q 1-FEH IIa was obtained by adding 20 µl of a supersaturated 1-kestose solution containing 2.05 M sodium potassium phosphate and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, to the inactive mutant 1-FEH IIa crystals for a period of 15 min. Fructose was added to 1-FEH IIa crystals by adding 20 µl of the crystallization solution containing 20% fructose to the 1-FEH IIa crystals in the hanging drop. After 24 h, crystals were cryoprotected for 10 min by a solution containing 2.05 M sodium potassium phosphate, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 22.5% PEG 400. Sucrose/1-FEH IIa complexes were obtained by soaking the crystals for 2 min in a supersaturated sucrose solution containing 2.05 M sodium potassium phosphate and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. A third inhibitor was added to native 1-FEH IIa crystals by soaking the crystals with 2.05 M sodium potassium phosphate, 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.0 and 30% DIM for 15 min. Crystals were then mounted in cryoloops and flashcooled in liquid nitrogen. All data collections were performed at 100 K using a N2 gas stream. Diffraction experiments were performed at the synchrotron either at DESY (Hamburg, Germany; beamline BW7A or beamline BW7B) or ESRF (Grenoble, France; beamline ID14-3). The obtained data sets were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK v.1.97.2 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure determination In order to check if substrate or inhibitor was able to bind native or mutant 1-FEH IIa, two | Fobs | - | Fcalc | and

| Fobs | - | Fcalc | Fourier electron density maps were calculated. This was done using the CNS program (version 1.1) (Brünger et al., 1998) during a refinement cycle using simulated annealing. When a large residual electron density indicated that possibly a substrate or inhibitor was bound, these compounds were subsequently manually built in the electron density. Finally, water molecules were added to the structure. The final refinement statistics for these structures can be seen in Table 2. Atomic coordinates and structure factor files have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 2ADE (1-FEH IIa/fructose), 2ADD (1-FEH IIa/sucrose), 2AEY (1-FEH IIa/DIM) and 2AEZ (E201Q 1-FEH IIa/ 1-kestose)). Sucrose inhibition studies Cloning and heterologous expression of wild-type, W82L and S101L mutant 1-FEH IIa enzymes were as described by De Coninck et al. (2005). At 96 h postinduction, the culture was centrifuged and proteins were precipitated for 1.5 h in 80% ammonium-sulphate saturated citrate-phosphate buffer (10 mM final, pH 5.0) on ice. Centrifugation (40 000 g) was performed for 15 min at 4°C. Finally the ammonium sulphate pellets were re-dissolved in 50 mM Na-Ac buffer, pH 5.0, with 0.02% (w/v) Na-azide. Centrifugation (10 000 g, for 5 min at 4°C) was performed to spin down undissolved material. An appropriate aliquot of the obtained supernatant was mixed with 5 mM commercial chicory inulin (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) as substrate and an array of different sucrose concentrations as inhibitor (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 mM) in 50 mM acetate buffer pH 5.0 also containing 0.02% (v/v) sodium azide. These reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for different time intervals. Enzyme reactions were stopped by keeping an aliquot for

The total activity of the enzymes was determined by measuring the amount of fructose release from inulin by anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (AEC-PAD) (Van den Ende & Van Laere, 1996). For all three enzymes, the remaining activity in the presence of sucrose as inhibitor is expressed as a percentage of the activity observed when no sucrose was added. Only data from the linear range were used. Table 3 shows the inhibitory effect as measured after 30 min of incubation.

Results
1-Kestose, a 1-F fructosyl derivative (Fig. 1d) of sucrose (Fig. 1c), is an excellent substrate of chicory 1-FEH IIa, while sucrose acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme (De Roover et al., 1999). For the heterologously expressed 1-FEH IIa enzyme, a

Ki of 3.5 mM was measured (not shown), which is close to the Ki of 5.9 mM as determined for the native enzyme (De Roover et al., 1999). Like for all fructofuranosidases, the fructose (Fig. 1a) homologue, 2,5 dideoxy-2,5-imino-D-mannitol or DIM (Fig. 1b), is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (Legler et al., 1993). The overall fold of chicory 1-FEH IIa consists of a five-folded -propeller domain with the active site, followed by a 2 -sheet domain (Verhaest et al., 2005). Soaking experiments of 1-FEH IIa with fructose, sucrose and DIM enriched the active site of the native 1-FEH IIa structure with one fructose (Fig. 2a, PDB code 2ADE), one DIM (Fig. 2b, PDB code AEY) and one sucrose (Fig. 2c, PDB code 2ADD) molecule, respectively. The substrate 1-kestose was also bound to the active site region of the inactive E201Q mutant 1-FEH IIa structure (Fig. 2d, PDB code 2AEZ). No major changes could be observed in the backbone of the 1FEH IIa structure upon binding of these inhibitors or substrate. Hydrogen bonds between the inhibitors/substrate and (mutant) 1-FEH IIa are presented in Table 4. A superposition of different inhibitors/substrates in the -1 subsite (see carbohydrate subsite nomenclature of Davies et al., 1997) of different GH 32 and 68 proteins clearly illustrates that the fructosyl unit present in sucrose (Meng & Fütterer, 2003; Nagem et al., 2004) and raffinose (Alberto et al., 2006), and the terminal fructosyl present in 1-kestose bind identically (Fig. 3). The position of DIM is also similar to that of fructose, since the N1 of DIM superposes on the O44 of fructose, the C6 (DIM) equals the C6 (fructose) and the C5 (DIM) takes an identical position as the C1 of fructose (PDB code AEY). However, the glucosyl moiety of sucrose in 1-FEH IIa (Fig. 4b) occupies a position clearly different from the one in levansucrase (Fig. 4e) and in the bacterial -fructosidase (Fig. 4f ). They are moved away from each other by c. 3 Å, but nevertheless they still stay in the same plane (Fig. 3). The fructosyl moiety at the +1 subsite in 1-kestose bound to 1-FEH IIa is situated at roughly the same position as the glucosyl moiety of sucrose in 1-FEH IIa (Figs 3, 4). However, because of the longer binding distance between two fructosyl units compared with the binding distance between the fructosyl and glucosyl moieties in sucrose, the fructosyl moiety at the +1 subsite in 1-kestose has moved c. 1.3 Å further away from the nucleophile, compared with the glucosyl moiety in sucrose (Figs 4b,c, 5). Interestingly, W82 occupies a different orientation in 1FEH IIa (Fig. 4a­c) compared with F102 in the fungal exoinulinase (Nagem et al., 2004; Fig. 4d), W163 and W224 in the levansucrases (Meng & Fütterer, 2003; Martinez-Fleites et al., 2005; Fig. 4e), and F74 in the bacterial -fructosidase (Alberto et al., 2004; Fig. 4f ). The orientation of F102/W163/F74 is constrained by stacking with Y131/F182/Y92. In 1-FEH IIa, however, W82 does not stack with an aromatic residue. Instead, a serine residue (S101) is found. Since a serine will not stack to W82, its position is less constrained. Site-directed mutagenesis

experiments demonstrated that W82L and S101L mutants are no longer inhibited by sucrose (Table 3). W82 is part of a conserved region among plant cell wall invertases and FEHs known as the `GSAT' region. S101 is part of the semiconserved `YTG region'. Table 5 shows an alignment of a selection of

plant cell wall invertases and FEHs in these regions. Strikingly, enzymes that are strongly inhibited by sucrose (Table 5) contain a serine (1-FEH IIa and IIb) or a glycine (1-FEH w1 and w2) residue in the YTG region. Instead, 1-FEH IIa contains a serine (S101) residue adjacent to W82. All plant invertases and some FEHs that are not, or only very weakly, inhibited by sucrose contain a W82 homologue (bold in Table 5) stacking with a hydrophobic amino acid (S101 homologue). Wheat 6-FEH contains an arginine residue at this position and this enzyme shows zero inhibition by sucrose as reported by Van Riet et al. (2006). Interestingly, a leucine instead of a tryptophane is observed in the GSAT region of chicory 1-FEH I (Table 5). Besides 1-kestose, longer inulins are good substrates for 1FEH IIa. Despite numerous soaking and cocrystallization attempts, we failed to include purified inulins and inulin mixtures (DP > 3) in the FEH IIa crystals. We found that the glycosylation side chains present on 1-FEH IIa take part in the crystallization process in such a way that a glycosylation side chain

of one 1-FEH IIa molecule occludes the cleft formed between the two domains of another 1-FEH IIa molecule, in this way preventing the binding of longer inulins in the cleft (not shown).

Discussion
Substrates and inhibitors in the active site of 1-FEH IIa and related enzymes Structural studies on proteins belonging to the family GH 32 (fungal exo-inulinase, Nagem et al., 2004; bacterial fructosidase, Alberto et al., 2006; 1-FEH IIa, this work) as well as to family GH 68 (levansucrase, Meng & Fütterer, 2003) in complex with a substrate (1-kestose in 1-FEH IIa, sucrose in levansucrase, raffinose in invertase/-fructosidase) or inhibitor (sucrose and fructose in 1-FEH IIa, fructose in fungal exo-inulinase) revealed that the terminal fructosyl unit is always positioned in a very similar way at the -1 subsite

(Figs 2­4). In this orientation, the anomeric C2 of fructose is positioned between the two catalytic active amino acids D22 and E201 of 1-FEH IIa (Fig. 5). The DIM inhibitor (Legler et al., 1993) mimics the structure of a fructose molecule (Fig. 2) and binds the active site in a similar orientation. Consequently fructose and DIM will act as an inhibitor by hindering the natural substrate to bind.

In contrast to the fructosyl unit, the configuration of the glucosyl moiety of sucrose present in 1-FEH IIa (termed the `inhibitor configuration' from this point on; see Fig. 4b) is different from that in bacterial levansucrase (Fig. 4e) and invertase/-fructosidase (termed `substrate configuration' from this point on). Essentially, these two glucosyl parts are positioned in the same plane but more or less alongside each

other (Figs 3, 4). We propose two major explanations for the altered position of the glucosyl part of sucrose in 1-FEH IIa. Firstly, 1-FEH IIa lacks the structural determinants for binding the glucosyl unit of sucrose present in Bacillus subtilis levansucrase (Arg 360 and Glu340; the homologues are Gly235 and Thr199 in 1-FEH IIa) or Thermotoga maritima invertase (Glu188; Thr199 in 1-FEH IIa). Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, W82 is shifted further away from the active site in 1-FEH IIa. In this way, space becomes available to bind sucrose in the inhibitor configuration. As explained above, W82 can be positioned differently in 1-FEH IIa because it does not stack with an aromatic residue as observed in the microbial enzymes (Fig. 4). 1-FEH IIa contains a serine (S101) adjacent to W82. Most probably, the smaller residues such as glycine and serine allow a different position of W82 and an alternative binding of sucrose in the inhibitor configuration. In contrast, all plant invertases contain a W82 homologue that stacks with a hydrophobic amino acid. This probably prevents the binding of sucrose in the inhibitor configuration and (together with other factors) might support the binding of sucrose in the substrate configuration. Wheat 6-FEH and chicory 1-FEH I, two enzymes that are not, or only very weakly, inhibited by sucrose, are changed in the YTG and GSAT regions, respectively (Table 5). Apparently this configuration prevents the binding of sucrose in both the inhibitor and substrate configurations. Conclusively, the presence of a differentially orientated tryptophane in the GSAT region may be essential for stabilizing the sucrose inhibitor configuration. This hypothesis was further tested by site-directed mutagenesis on W82 and S101 in 1-FEH IIa; the tests unambiguously demonstrated that W82L and S101L mutants are no longer inhibited by sucrose (Table 3). It can be concluded that not only the specific orientation of W82 but also the identity of W82 itself is important for binding the sucrose into the inhibitor orientation. Apparently the sucrose cannot be stabilized at all in the active site of the W82L mutant, which is also in accordance with the absence of sucrose inhibition for chicory 1-FEH I. The hypothesis should be further tested on a wider array of plant FEHs. For instance, it would be very interesting to decipher the functionality and sucrose inhibition of Arabidopsis cell wall invertase 5 and the putative chicory invertase (Table 5). It should be noted that so far all the structurally studied GH 32 and 68 family members, except for 1-FEH IIa, are able to degrade sucrose, suggesting that the inhibitor configuration is clearly different from the substrate configuration. At first glance, the +1 fructosyl of 1-kestose in the mutant 1-FEH IIa and the +1 glucosyl of sucrose in 1-FEH IIa take rather similar positions, while 1-kestose is hydrolysed and sucrose is not. Similar distances between the nucleophile and the anomeric C2 are observed in both complexes (Fig. 5). Moreover, comparable distances were also reported for the other GH 32 and GH 68 enzyme-carbohydrate complexes, suggesting that this distance is not an important determinant for the substrate or

inhibitor configuration. However, a closer look at the distances between the acid-base catalyst and the oxygens of the saccharides reveals some important differences (Fig. 5). The acid-base catalyst E201 (proton donor) in 1-FEH IIa forms a short H-linkage (2.74 Å) with the O2 of the glucosyl part of sucrose (Fig. 5a). Consequently, the glycosidic oxygen (3.37 Å) will not be protonated and an enzymatic reaction will not occur. Besides W82 and S101, Q107 could also be involved in stabilizing glucose in this configuration since it forms a Hlinkage to O4 (3.18 Å). In the mutant 1-FEH IIa 1-kestose complex (Fig. 5b), on the other hand, Q201 takes an identical position as E201 in the wild-type 1-FEH IIa. Strikingly, in this case the O3 forms a close intramolecular hydrogen bond (2.54 Å) with the glycosidic oxygen O1 between glucose and fructose in the 1-kestose molecule. In this way the acid-base catalyst E201 can fulfil its function as proton donor to the glycosidic oxygen O1, since it is not hindered by O3 in its proton donation. It should be noted that the observed intramolecular H-linkage is only possible in 1-kestose and not in sucrose. The exact orientation of the fructose in 1-kestose at the +1 subsite (and hence the exact position of O3 allowing the formation of the intramolecular H-linkage) might also be mainly determined by Q107 forming a H-linkage to O4 (3.38 Å). Conclusively, 1-FEH IIa contains a differently orientated W82 and probably lacks some necessary amino acids to stabilize sucrose in the substrate configuration. As a consequence, the glucosyl moiety of sucrose binds in the inhibitor orientation and sucrose acts as a competitive inhibitor of fructan degradation. In this position, the O2 of the glucose part of sucrose forms a strong H-linkage with the acid-base catalyst, inhibiting sucrose catalysis. Although the intermediate fructose in 1kestose takes a rather similar position as the glucose in sucrose, the homologous O3 of the intermediate fructose makes a very strong intramolecular H-linkage and does not interfere with the catalytic process. It should be further tested whether similar mechanisms can explain the substrate/inhibitor specificities in other enzyme-carbohydrate complexes within the GH families 32 and 68. It should, however, be realized that, with the exception of sucrose in 1-FEH IIa described in this work, only single active-site mutants were used to study the enzyme-substrate complexes. In all these cases, it cannot be excluded that the mutation itself influences the apparent position of these substrates, and future work should focus on generating an array of different active-site mutants to obtain with more certainty the exact intermolecular distances between enzyme and substrate. Sucrose as FEH regulator: physiological implications In higher plants, sucrose occupies a central position as the major product of photosynthesis and as the major transport molecule involved in growth, development, storage, carbohydrate allocation and signal transduction processes (Salerno & Curatti, 2003). An excess in sugar supply generally favours the

expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis of reserve compounds (mainly carbohydrates such as starch, fructan, raffinose family oligosaccharides or sucrose as well as some lipids and proteins), while repressing the expression of enzymes involved in photosynthesis and reserve mobilization (Koch, 1996). Sugar repression is a ubiquitous regulatory system for maintaining an economical balance between supply (source) and demand (sink). Although plants are considered as carbon autotrophs, they are heterotrophic during some part of their life cycle or in nongreen organs such as roots and flowers. Furthermore, carbohydrate depletion by a reduced photosynthesis (environmental stresses, shading, pathogen infection, grazing, mowing, defoliation) is a fact of life for most plants (Van den Ende et al., 2001). Plants mobilize their reserve carbohydrates under these circumstances and use an array of different hydrolytic enzymes (amylases, FEHs, -galactosidases and invertases) for this purpose. The regulation of these processes might occur at different levels. Besides the sugar-dependent regulation at the level of transcription/translation, many hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate degradation (invertases, FEHs) might be directly regulated at the enzyme level. Interestingly, vacuolar invertases are present in excess in green tomato fruits, but as yet no invertase activities could be measured (Husain et al., 2001). Proteinaceous invertase inhibitors with low Ki values (Bracho & Whitaker, 1990; Hothorn et al., 2004) might be involved in these inhibitory processes. Recent data suggest an ABA-induced post-translational regulation of invertases by reversible protein phosphorylation (Pan et al., 2006). Furthermore, FEHs could be purified from wheat stems during the period of active fructan synthesis (Van den Ende et al., 2003a). Sucrose was found to be a strong inhibitor for these purified FEHs, suggesting that the FEH activities in planta could be regulated by sucrose. This type of FEH regulation is probably widespread in fructan plants, as most FEHs characterized so far are strongly inhibited by sucrose in vitro (Marx et al., 1997a,b; Van den Ende et al., 2003a). The Ki of sucrose is low enough to ensure an effective inhibition of these FEH enzymes when sucrose is high (typically 100 mM sucrose in the vacuole). The major advantage of such regulation is a rapid switch from net fructan synthesis (high sucrose concentrations) to net degradation when sucrose is low. This very fast response might be especially crucial for a rapid regrowth of grasses after defoliation (Morvan-Bertrand et al., 2001). This mechanism helps to explain the apparent paradox of the high FEH activities that are often observed in fructan-accumulating tissues.

light on the mechanism by which sucrose could regulate the activity of sucrose-inhibited FEHs in plants in general.

Conclusion
We characterized complexes of chicory 1-FEH IIa together with its substrate 1-kestose and with several inhibitors including sucrose. The complexes explain why sucrose acts as a strong inhibitor and not as a substrate while 1-kestose acts as a very good substrate. These fine-molecular insights shed
