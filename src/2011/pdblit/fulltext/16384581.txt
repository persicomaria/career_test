Abstract The Janus-faced atracotoxins (J-ACTXs) are a family of insect-specific excitatory toxins isolated from the venom of Australian funnel-web spiders (genera Atrax and Hadronyche ). In addition to a classical cystine knot motif, these toxins contain a rare vicinal disulfide bond. While the vicinal disulfide is known to be critical for insecticidal activity, the role of other residues in toxin function remains to be determined. In this study, we probed the role of the structurally disordered N- and C-terminal residues using a panel of recombinant mutants of the prototypic family member J-ACTX-Hv1c. We found that the structurally disordered C-terminal residues (Glu 36 and Pro 37) were dispensable for toxin function. However, whereas deletion of Ala 1 had minimal impact on toxin function, deletion of both Ala 1 and Ile 2 decreased insecticidal activity more than 70-fold. We propose that Ile 2 forms a part of the target binding site of J-ACTX-Hv1c. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Insect-borne infectious diseases such as malaria affect at least one billion people worldwide, and over two million infected individuals die each year (Gubler, 1998). Arthropods that transmit these diseases, as well as those that threaten human agriculture, have traditionally been controlled by spraying broad-spectrum chemical pesticides. However, public disquiet about the environmental and human health risks (Betarbet et al., 2000; Gorell et al., 1998) associated with chemical pesticides, as well as the emergence of pesticide-resistant insect populations (Brogdon and McAllister, 1998; Feyereisen, 1995), has stimulated the search for new `environmentally friendly' pest-control strategies. One recently implemented approach is to engineer plants to produce insect-specific toxins (Shelton et al.,

2000); while this approach has markedly reduced pesticide use in many agricultural areas it cannot be used to address the problem of arthropods such as mosquitoes that transmit infectious diseases. A potentially more selective, and perhaps more widely applicable, method is to use insect-specific viruses as vectors to deliver toxins to a restricted number of target arthropods without harming vertebrates and non-target insects (Bonning and Hammock, 1996; Cory et al., 1994; Treacy, 1999). However, the current paucity of well-characterized insect-specific peptide toxins limits the long-term viability of both of these genomic approaches. Spider venoms can be viewed as pre-optimized combinatorial libraries of insecticidal compounds (Wang et al., 2001). We reasoned that these venoms were likely to contain insect-specific peptide toxins that might be useful for genomic approaches to arthropod pest control and might serve as lead compounds for the development of novel chemical pesticides. By screening the venom of the lethal Blue Mountains funnel-web spider Hadronyche versuta (Miller et al., 2000) we

discovered three families of insect-specific toxins (Wang et al., 1999, 2000, 2001), including a family of excitatory neurotoxins known as the Janus-faced atracotoxins (J-ACTXs; see Fig. 1(A)). The J-ACTXs derive their name from a strikingly asymmetric distribution of residues--one face of the toxin contains a high proportion of charged residues while the opposing face is completely apolar (Wang et al., 2000). In addition to a classical cystine knot motif, the prototypic family member J-ACTX-Hv1c was found to contain an extremely rare vicinal disulfide bridge (i.e. a disulfide bond between adjacent cystine residues; see Fig. 1(B)) (Wang et al., 2000). There are no other examples of vicinal disulfides in natural toxins, and J-ACTX-Hv1c is one of the only three proteins that are known to contain a vicinal disulfide. While the vicinal disulfide bridge is absolutely critical for toxin function (Wang et al., 2000), the role of other residues remains to be determined. In this study, we examined the functional importance of the unstructured Nand C-terminal residues. While the unstructured C-terminal residues (Glu 36 and Pro 37) appear to be dispensable for insecticidal activity, we show that Ile 2, which is proximal to the functionally critical vicinal disulfide, is likely to form a part of the target binding site.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Insect toxicity assays Insecticidal toxicity was determined quantitatively by direct injection of peptides dissolved in insect saline (Eitan et al., 1990) into Musca domestica (house flies). Flies of undetermined sex (body weight 9 ­ 20 mg) were injected with 1 ­ 2 ml of toxin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 105 pmol g21. Control flies were injected with 2 ml of insect saline. Ten flies were injected at each concentration of toxin. An Arnold microapplicator (Burkard Scientific Supply, Rickmansworth, England) equipped with a 29-gauge needle was used to administer dorsal thoracic injections. Specimens were temporarily immobilized at 4 8C for the injections and then immediately returned to room temperature (24 8C). LD50 values (i.e. the doses that cause 50% lethality at 24 h post-injection) were calculated from dose­ response curves as described previously (Wang et al., 1999). 2.2. Purification of recombinant J-ACTX-Hv1c Recombinant J-ACTX-Hv1c (rJ-ACTX-Hv1c) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells transformed

Fig. 2. Two-step strategy developed for production of N-terminal truncation mutants. In the first step, overlap PCR was used to mutate either Ala 1 (as illustrated) or Ile 2 to Met. In the second step, following thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of the GST fusion protein, the recombinant toxin was cleaved with CNBr to give flush cleavage at either Met 1 (as illustrated) or Met 2. This procedure enabled efficient production of recombinant toxin missing one or two N-terminal residues.

with plasmid pFM1 as described elsewhere (Maggio and King, 2002); this plasmid encodes the toxin as an in-frame fusion to the C-terminus of Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST), with an intervening thrombin cleavage site. The GST fusion protein was purified using glutathione (GSH) affinity chromatography, then the recombinant toxin was liberated by on-column cleavage with thrombin, eluted from the column, refolded in a GSH redox buffer, and purified to . 98% homogeneity using reverse-phase HPLC (rpHPLC) as described previously (Maggio and King, 2002). The unmodified recombinant toxin is identical to the native sequence except for a Gly-Ser extension at the Nterminus, which is a vestige of the thrombin cleavage site. The unmodified recombinant toxin was subjected to limited proteolysis in order to remove the Gly-Ser extension. 1 U of Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase I (Sigma) was added to lyophilized recombinant toxin dissolved in 200 ml cleavage buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0). The reaction mixture was incubated at ambient temperature (24 8C) for 2 h, then the reaction products were fractionated by rpHPLC using a linear gradient of 15 ­ 22% acetonitrile over 15 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min21. The peak corresponding to the native JACTX-Hv1c sequence was identified using electrospray mass spectrometry. The native-sequence recombinant toxin was lyophilized, resuspended in insect saline, and utilized for insect biological assays.

2.3. Generation of N-terminal truncation mutants Two N-terminal truncation mutants were generated using a two-step procedure (see Fig. 2). First, either Ala 1 or Ile 2 was mutated to Met. The mutations were introduced by PCR methods using the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers with plasmid pFM1 (Maggio and King, 2002) as the template: A1M-F: 50 -GGATCCATGATCTGCACCGGTGCG-30 I2M-F: 50 -GGATCCGCGATGTGCACCGGTGCG-30 J-Hv1c-R: 50 -GAATTCTCACGGTTCATCTTTACGGCAGT-30 PCR products were purified and cloned as in-frame fusions to the C-terminus of S. japonicum GST as for the native sequence. The mutant fusion proteins were then expressed and affinity purified as outlined earlier. The recombinant mutant toxins were subsequently liberated by on-column cleavage with thrombin, eluted from the column, then lyophilized and resuspended in 70% formic acid (Fisher) prior to addition of 0.2 g cyanogen bromide (CNBr), which specifically cleaves at methionine residues. The cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 8 h at ambient temperature (24 8C) before being quenched with 20 ml of 10% glycine. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against water using 1 kDa cut-off dialysis tubing, lyophilized, and the desired reaction product purified using rpHPLC. The identities of the purified truncation mutants

were verified using electrospray mass spectrometry. The rpHPLC-purified truncation mutants were lyophilized, resuspended in insect saline, and utilized for insect biological assays. 2.4. Generation of C-terminal truncation mutant A C-terminal truncation mutant (J-ACTX-Hv1c1 ­ 35) lacking residues Glu 36 and Pro 37 was produced by PCR methods using pFM1 as the template and the following primers: J-Hv1c-F: 50 -GGATCCGCGATCTGCACCGGTGCGGA-30 J-Hv1c-EP-R: 50 -GAATTCTCAATCTTTACGGCAGTAGC-30 The C-terminal truncation mutant was overexpressed and purified as described in Section 2.2, and subsequently used for insect toxicity assays. 2.5. Generation of double truncation mutant A truncated toxin lacking both the unstructured N- and C-terminal residues (J-ACTX-Hv1c3 ­ 35) was constructed using PCR methods by utilizing primers I2M-F and J-Hv1cEP-R with pFM1 as the template. The toxin was purified and cleaved with CNBr as for the N-terminal truncation mutants (Section 2.3). The rpHPLC-purified short toxin was utilized for insect toxicity assays. 2.6. Verification of recombinant plasmids and peptides All plasmid inserts produced in this work were verified by DNA sequencing at the University of Connecticut Biotechnology Center (http://www.ucc.uconn.edu/ ~wwwbiotc/). The identity of each purified recombinant peptide was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry at the University of Massachusetts Mass Spectrometry Center (http://www.pse.umass.edu/ms/); the

predicted and experimentally determined masses are listed in Table 1. The structural integrity of each of the recombinant peptides was examined using circular dichroic (CD) spectroscopy as described previously (Tedford et al., 2001; Maggio and King, 2002). Briefly, CD spectra were recorded at 4 8C using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Toxins (25 mM in 1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were loaded into a 0.1 cm rectangular quartz cell and spectra were collected as the average of 15 scans acquired using a scan rate of 20 nm min21 and a response time of 4 s. A blank spectrum consisting of buffer alone was acquired under identical conditions and subtracted from each of the toxin spectra.

3. Results 3.1. Structural integrity of recombinant peptides We recently described an efficient bacterial expression system for production of recombinant J-ACTX-Hv1c; the yield of correctly folded wild-type toxin, as a percentage of the total toxin obtained after affinity purification, was ,85% (Maggio and King, 2002). Since the truncation mutants produced in this study involved deletion of a small number of structurally disordered N- and C-terminal residues (see Fig. 1(B)) we did not anticipate that these deletions would affect the three-dimensional fold of the toxin. Nonetheless, we tested this experimentally by acquiring far-UV CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant recombinant toxins. As shown in Fig. 3, even the most severely truncated toxin (J-ACTX3 ­ 35), which is missing two residues at both the N- and C-termini, had a CD spectrum almost indistinguishable from that of the fulllength toxin, with a maximum ellipticity at , 225 nm which is characteristic of correctly folded J-ACTX-Hv1c (Maggio and King, 2002). The CD spectrum of each toxin mutant listed in Table 1 was superimposable on that of the fulllength recombinant toxin (data not shown), indicating that

Table 1, the LD50 of the unmodified recombinant toxin containing the Gly-Ser extension was 319 ^ 10 pmol g21, which is only 3.5-fold higher than the LD50 of the native recombinant toxin. We interpret this as a minor loss of insecticidal potency, since major loss-of-function mutants found by alanine scanning mutagenesis, as well as mutations of the vicinal disulfide, typically cause more than 50-fold reduction in the LD50 (Maggio and King, 2002). We conclude that the toxin can tolerate small extensions at the N-terminus. 3.4. The structurally disordered C-terminal residues are dispensable for toxin function

all of the recombinant toxins used in this study have a native three-dimensional fold. 3.2. J-ACTX-Hv1c is active against dipterans We previously demonstrated that the J-ACTXs are lethal to coleopterans and orthopterans but are inactive in vertebrate neuromuscular preparations as well as newborn mice (Wang et al., 2001). In this study, we examined whether the J-ACTXs are also active against insects in the medically important dipteran order (e.g. flies and mosquitoes) which are responsible for the transmission of numerous infectious diseases (e.g. malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, filariasis, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis). Recombinant J-ACTX-Hv1c corresponding to the mature toxin sequence was produced by aminopeptidase-catalyzed removal of the N-terminal Gly-Ser extension from the unmodified recombinant toxin (see Section 2.2). We found that the LD50 for `native' recombinant JACTX-Hv1c in house flies (M. domestica ) was 91 ^ 5 pmol g21 (see Table 1), which is similar to the LD50 of 167 ^ 10 pmol g21 previously reported for JACTX-Hv1c in the orthopteran Acheta domestica (Wang et al., 2001). We also found that J-ACTX-Hv1c was lethal to fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster ) but we could not obtain quantitative estimates of the toxicity (data not shown). 3.3. Minor N-terminal extensions are not deleterious to toxin function Since it was difficult to reproducibly obtain native toxin via aminopeptidase-catalyzed cleavage of the N-terminal Gly-Ser from the unmodified recombinant toxin, we examined whether the Gly-Ser extension was deleterious to the insecticidal potency of J-ACTX-Hv1c. As listed in

The three-dimensional solution structure of J-ACTXHv1c (Fig. 1(B)) consists of a highly structured globular core (residues 3 ­ 35) built around a central cystine knot motif (Wang et al., 2000); this region also contains the functionally critical vicinal disulfide bridge between Cys 13 and Cys 14 (Fig. 1(B)). In contrast to the structured core, the two N-terminal (Ala 1 and Ile 2) and C-terminal (Glu 36 and Pro 37) residues are structurally disordered in solution. While structural disorder does not necessarily indicate that these residues are not functionally important, mutants with these residues deleted are an obvious starting point for elucidating the minimum functional region of the toxin. We first used PCR-directed mutagenesis to produce a recombinant toxin containing the N-terminal Gly-Ser extension but lacking the two C-terminal residues (see Section 2.4). The LD50 of the C-terminal truncate was 468 ^ 10 pmol g21 (see Table 1), which is not significantly different to the LD50 of the same construct containing the Cterminal residues (319 ^ 10 pmol g21). We conclude that the two C-terminal residues are dispensable for toxin function. 3.5. Functional importance of the structurally disordered Nterminal residues In order to examine the functional significance of the structurally disordered N-terminal residues we developed a two-step procedure (see Fig. 2) that enabled us to make `flush' N-terminal truncations. This procedure took advantage of the fact that the mature toxin sequence contains no methionine residues. Thus, production of recombinant toxin with Ala 1 or Ile 2 mutated to Met followed by CNBrcatalyzed cleavage enabled production of toxin that was missing either Ala 1 or both Ala 1 and Ile 2 (see Section 2.3). The LD50 of mutant toxin in which only Ala 1 was deleted (123 ^ 13 pmol g21; see Table 1) was very similar to that of the full-length toxin (91 ^ 5 pmol g21). Thus, we conclude that Ala 1 is not essential for the insecticidal activity of J-ACTX-Hv1c. In striking contrast, deletion of both Ala 1 and Ile 2 caused a dramatic 70-fold increase in the LD50 (see Table 1), which indicates that Ile 2 is important for toxin function.

vicinal disulfide bridge of J-ACTX-Hv1c is located at the center of an exposed hydrophobic surface that might comprise the target-binding surface of the toxin (Wang et al., 2000). Consistent with this speculation, although Ile 2 is somewhat disordered in the solution structure of J-ACTXHv1c, it nevertheless is spatially proximal to the critical vicinal disulfide. Indeed, residues 2, 13, and 14 form an almost contiguous surface patch (see Fig. 4) that probably represents a key portion of the bioactive surface of the JACTXs. We are currently using alanine scanning mutagenesis of the functional core of J-ACTX-Hv1c (i.e. residues 2 ­ 35 as delineated in this study) in order to fully map the bioactive surface of the toxin (Fig. 4).

4. Discussion We previously showed that the J-ACTXs are lethal to insects from the orders Coleoptera and Orthoptera (Wang et al., 2000), making them useful lead compounds for the design of new agrochemicals. In this study we demonstrated that these toxins are also lethal to various dipterans, making these neurotoxins useful leads for the design of insecticides directed against flies and mosquitoes that transmit infectious diseases. In order to begin defining the key functional residues for J-ACTX function, we systematically deleted the structurally disordered N- and C-terminal residues of the prototypic family member J-ACTX-Hv1c and examined the effect of the deletions on toxin function. We found that the Cterminal residues Glu 36 and Pro 37 are dispensable for toxin function. This is consistent with the observation that these residues are absent from other members of the JACTX family (see Fig. 1(A)), yet all family members have similar LD50 values in A. domestica (Wang et al., 2000). We also found that deletion of the N-terminal residue (Ala 1) had minimal impact on toxin function, consistent with the fact that this residue is non-conservatively replaced by Thr in other family members (see Fig. 1(A)). In contrast to deletion of Ala 1 and the two C-terminal residues, deletion of Ile 2 had a dramatic impact on the insecticidal activity of J-ACTX-Hv1c. While deletion of Ala 1 caused a small 1.35-fold increase in the LD50, deletion of both Ala 1 and Ile 2 increased the LD50 by more than 70fold. It is apparent from comparison of the data in Table 1 that the dramatic reduction in LD50 of a doubly-truncated toxin (J-ACTX-Hv1c3 ­ 35) missing both the two N-terminal residues and the two C-terminal residues is primarily due to the absence of Ile 2. We conclude that Ile 2 is critical to the function of J-ACTX-Hv1c, consistent with its strict conservation in the three J-ACTX family members. It was previously noted that the functionally critical
