Here we report the X-ray structures of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease and the inactive [D25N]HIV-1 protease complexed with the ketomethylene isostere inhibitor Ac­Thr­Ile­Nlew[CO­ CH2]Nle­Gln­Arg.amide at 1.4 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. In complex with the active enzyme, the keto-group was found to be converted into the hydrated gem-diol, while the structure of the complex with the inactive D25N enzyme revealed an intact keto-group. These data support the general acid­general base mechanism for HIV-1 protease catalysis. Ó 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three distinctly different chemical mechanisms have been proposed for catalysis of peptide bond cleavage by aspartic proteases. In the first one, a nucleophilic aspartic acid side chain carboxylate attacks the carbonyl-group of the peptide bond, forming a covalent enzyme-substrate tetrahedral intermediate, followed by expulsion of the amine component.1 Second, is the general acid­general base mechanism, where one catalytic aspartate side chain carboxylate (COOÀ) acts as a general base to remove a proton from the water molecule nucleophile, while another aspartic acid side chain carboxyl (COOH) general acid donates a proton to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the scissile peptide bond.2,3 In the third `kinetic isomechanism', a 10-membered cyclic structure is formed, involving the two aspartic acid side chain carboxyl groups (COOÀ), with a proton between them, and the water molecule nucleophile; this mechanism allows for energy-inexpensive proton shuffling within the cyclic structure along the reaction coordinate.4 The last two mechanisms also invoke a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB); in the general acid­general base mechanism the LBHB would stabilize

the transition state,5,6 while in the kinetic isomechanism it allows for hydrogen tunneling.4 X-ray structures of aspartic protease enzymes cocrystallized with inhibitors that are available in the Protein Data Bank do not contain the lytic water molecule. Thus, the hypothesis that the lytic water is not initially present in the active site and that catalysis occurs via a covalent enzyme-substrate tetrahedral intermediate cannot be ruled out. A ketomethylene isostere, in which the scissile peptide bond [C(O)NH] is substituted by a w[C(O)CH2] linkage, is the most suitable substrate surrogate to test the `covalent intermediate' hypothesis. If a water molecule is initially present in the active site, then the active enzyme should catalyze the hydration of the keto group to form the gem-diol; on the other hand, direct nucleophilic attack by an ionized aspartic acid side chain would lead to a covalent adduct with the inhibitor that would be readily observed by X-ray crystallography. Chemical synthesis of substrate-derived ketomethylene inhibitors and their tight binding to HIV-1 protease was reported previously (IC50 down to 4.6 nM).7 We have reproduced the chemical synthesis for the selected ketomethylene isostere (IC50 6.3 nM,7 mimicking the p2/NC cleavage site) and cocrystallized the resulting substrate-derived inhibitor with wild-type HIV-1 protease (based on the SF2 isolate) and with the inactive [D25N]HIV-1 protease analogue. Total chemical synthesis of the HIV-1 protease8 was based on a two segment native chemical ligation (Fig. 1a).9 Both segments were prepared by in situ neutralization Boc chemistry SPPS,10

Figure 1. (a) Total chemical synthesis of wild-type HIV-1 PR and the [D25N]HIV-1 PR analogue. Native chemical ligation of two unprotected synthetic peptides was followed by alkylation with 2-bromoacetamide to convert Cys41 to w-homo-Gln41. After deformylation of Trp6 and Trp42 and reverse phase HPLC purification, the (1-99)-polypeptide was folded by two-step dialysis against 10 mM NaOAc, pH 5.6. MPaArg4 = 3-mercaptopropionate tetraarginine.amide (i.e. the thioester leaving group). Analytical HPLC traces (k = 214 nm) and ESI-MS of purified wild-type HIV-1 protease (b) and the [D25N]HIV-1 PR analogue (c). In (d), the structure of the ketomethylene isostere inhibitor is shown. After the synthesis it exists as a mixture of diastereomers (with respect to the carbon atom corresponding to the a-carbon of Nle4), which were separated by reverse phase HPLC. (e) Analytical HPLC traces (k = 214 nm) and ESI-MS of the (R)-`Nle4' diastereomer (KVS-1) and the (S)-`Nle4' diastereomer (KVS-2). See Supplementary Data for more information.

and after ligation the Cys41 residue at the ligation site was alkylated with 2-bromoacetamide to form a w-homo-Gln41 residue. After removal of the formyl groups from Trp6 and Trp42, the (199)-polypeptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and folded by two-step dialysis to form fully active enzyme (kcat 23.4 ± 0.4 sÀ1, Km 25.1 ± 1.2 lM). The inactive [D25N]HIV-1 protease analogue was synthesized according to the same strategy. Chemical synthesis of the ketomethylene isostere Ac­Thr­Ile­ Nlew[CO­CH2]Nle­Gln­Arg.amide (Fig. 1d) gave two diastereomers (abbreviated as KVS-1 and KVS-2), differing in their stereochemistry at the tertiary carbon corresponding to the a-carbon of the Nle4 residue. The diastereomers could be readily separated by reverse phase HPLC on C18, 10 Â 250 mm column (see Fig. 1e; and Supplementary Data), and their stereochemical identity was inferred on the basis of their cocrystallization behavior with HIV1 protease. For the KVS-1 diastereomer, crystals could be obtained within 1­2 days using standard crystallization conditions11 developed for HIV-1 protease/inhibitor complexes.

Use of a ketone functionality in aspartic protease inhibitors was originally suggested for ketone analogues of statines (statones) to mimic the presumed tetrahedral intermediate.12,13 It was further discovered that statones are weaker binders than their hydroxy counterparts; this was attributed to the unfavorable equilibrium for hydration of the ketone function.14 The [C(O)CH2] moiety was thus substituted by 2,2-difluorostatone moiety [C(O)CF2] which is readily hydrated in water to give the gem-diol.15 The 2,2-difluorostatones were found to be 50- to 1000-fold better inhibitors than non-fluorinated analogues.16 In contrast to statones, peptide substrate-derived non-fluorinated ketomethylene isosteres are 5-10 times more potent inhibitors of HIV-1 protease than their hydroxyethyl counterparts.7 In the work reported here, we have determined high resolution Xray structures for a substrate-derived ketomethylene isostere complexed with fully active (`wild type') HIV-1 protease, and for the complex of the same ketomethylene inhibitor with inactive [D25N]HIV-1 protease (Table 1). In the complex with inactive

[D25N]HIV-1 protease, the ketone group was found to be intact indicating that the ketone exists predominantly in the non-hydrated form in water solution (see Fig. 2a and c), which is in agreement with previous studies of the variety of carbonyl compounds.17 The complex with the wild type HIV-1 protease, however, clearly demonstrated the tetrahedral geometry of an hydrated ketone group (Fig. 2b and d). This result unambiguously demonstrates that hydration of the ketomethylene isostere is due to the first step of the proteolytic catalytic mechanism of HIV-1 protease. Recently, Kumar et al.18 have been able to directly view by Xray crystallography an actual tetrahedral intermediate by soaking peptide substrate into a crystal of apo-HIV-1 protease. In the crystal, the enzyme is locked in a `closed' conformation and, presumably, this inflexibility prevents dissociation of the tetrahedral intermediate to release products. With an alternative approach, Kovalevsky et al.19 successfully crystallized the tetrahedral intermediate by incorporating Thr at the P10 position, which is known to greatly diminish the ability of protease to hydrolyze the peptide bond. Figure 3 depicts the superposition of the active site region in the HIV-1 protease and hydrated KVS-1 (this work), and tetrahedral intermediates for wild-type and I54V mutants, determined at 1.46 and 1.50 Å resolution, respectively. Although the substrate peptide sequences are not the same, the methylene unit serves as a very natural replacement for NH-moiety. A number of short Hbonds were observed in the complex of wild-type HIV-1 protease with KVS-1 inhibitor (Fig. 2d). However, whereas in the structures of actual tetrahedral intermediates very short, strong hydrogen

Figure 3. Superposition of the active site regions of wild-type HIV-1 protease complexed with KVS-1 inhibitor (gray) onto structures of tetrahedral peptide intermediates of wild-type HIV-1 protease (PDB ID:3B7V, in cyan) and I54V mutant (PDB ID:3B80, in magenta).

bond has been observed between one of the aspartates and one hydroxyl group of the gem-diol moiety (2.3 Å in PDB ID:3B7V and 2.5 Å PDB ID:3B80),19 in the structure with KVS-1 the identical H-bond is loosened to 2.7 Å (Fig. 2d). Our present data do not support the `covalent intermediate' mechanism of catalysis in HIV-1 protease; if direct attack had taken place one would expect for this inhibitor (KVS-1) to be covalently bound to one of the aspartates. On the other hand, the structure of the inhibitor mimics a natural tetrahedral intermediate very closely and hence may be of use in advanced studies by X-ray crystallography and neutron diffraction to elucidate the nature of short, strong hydrogen bonds in the active sites of aspartic acid proteases.
