ABSTRACT The structure of 2(4-amino-benzosulfonimido)-5-methyl-3H-1,3,4-thiadiazole has been established by X-ray crystallography from diffractometer data. C,H,,N,O,S, (M, = 270.33) crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Pbca with a = 10.168(l), b = 11.122(l), c = 21.237(2) A, V= 2401.8(7) _k3,2 = 8, D, = 1.50 g cmW3and @(Cu Ka) = 39.5 cm-`. The structure has been solved by direct methods and refined to R = 0.044 for 1889 observed reflections. Comparing it with the structures of the related sulfathiazole polymorphs the second nitrogen atom in the hetero ring does not alter its predominant tautomeric (imido) form, but strengthens the S. * *O close contact (2.762(2) A) formed between the ring sulfur atom and one of the oxygens of the sulfonyl group. The coplanar new hetero ring closed by the S**. 0 approach involves an antiperiplanar exocyclic N lone pair and Svl--0 bond arrangement resulting in an optimum n(N)-o*(SVL_O) orbital interaction. As an additional result a strong SVLN(spZ) bond would be expected if the N lone pair were not involved in the formation of intermolecular NH* S-N hydrogen bonds binding molecular dimers. These altogether seem to be in favour of a "throughconjugation" (M. Colapietro, A. Domenicano, C. Marciante and G. Portalone, Z. Naturforsch., Teil B, 37 (1982) 1309) between Svl and the terminal NH, moiety of the sulfanilamide group. INTRODUCTION

The antibacterial activity and toxicity of the substituted sulfanilamides depend upon the nature of the group R attached to amido nitrogen. Of the hundreds of such compounds that have been synthesized hitherto several have been the subject of X-ray analysis, e.g. sulfathiazoles [ 1, 21, succinoylsulfathiazole [ 31, sulfisoxazole [4], sulfamethazine [ 51, sulfaguanidines [ 6,

71, sulfamethoxypyridazine [8], etc. Now we present the structure of 2(4-amino-benzosulfonimido)-5-methyl-3H-l,3,4-thiadiazole which is reportedly of enhanced antibacterial activity over 1,3,4-sulfathdiazole due to the presence of the methyl group at the 5-position of the thiadiazole ring [9, lo]. The introduction of this methyl group increases its solubility, rate of absorption and excretion and hydrophobicity, thus imparting favourable properties for binding to protein and perhaps to folate enzyme [ 111. Another advantage of this drug is that other than its antibacterial property it also possesses hypoglycemic activity. Beyond pharmacological aspects, it was also interesting to see how the second nitrogen atom in the hetero ring influences the tautomerism exhibited by the amidine group [12] of the compound and the S- -00 no bond-single bond interaction [13, 141 between the hetero ring and one of the oxygen atoms of the sulfonyl group.
EXPERIMENTAL

A white prism crystal of dimensions 0.15 mm X 0.35 mm X 0.50 mm was mounted on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer. Cell constants (Table 1) were determined by least-squares refinement on diffractometer angles for 25 reflections. Intensities were measured with graphite monochromated Cu Ka radiation using 20 - w scan in the range 1.5 < 0 < 75" at 23 _+1 Co. Three standard reflections (571; 734; 0, 0, 16) were monitored every hour and showed no significant deviation (1.4%). A total of 4948 reflections were collected in two equivalent eighths (denoted by the indices hkl and hkl, respectively) of the reciprocal space. Merging of the symmetry-related reflections led to 2383 unique observations. Phases for 400 reflections having E 2 1.41 were obtained by the MULTAN program [15]. The E map computed from the phase set with the best figure of merit (1.14) revealed 14 out of the 17 non-hydrogen atoms. The remaining atoms were located in a subsequent weighted Fourier synthesis. Since I-( is relatively high, at the end of the isotropic refinement (R = 0.16) an empirical absorption correction was calculated

for 3837 observations using the program DIFABS [16]. The minimum and maximum absorption corrections were 0.680 and 1.513, respectively. This improved R to 0.125. Subsequent full matrix least-squares refinement of the fractional atomic coordinates with vibrational parameters that were anisotropic for non-hydrogen atoms and isotropic for hydrogen atoms using 1889 average intensities with I > 3a(I) led to the final conventional R values given in Table 1. Coordinates of H atoms bound to C atoms were generated from assumed geometries while those belonging to the NH and NH2 groups were located in difference electron density calculations. The highest peak in the final Ap map was 0.30(5) eA_`. Scattering factors were taken from standard tables [ 171. A list of structure factors and anisotropic temperature parameters is available from the authors on request.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The solid state conformation of 2(4-amino-benzosulfonimido)-li-methyl3H-1,3,4-thiadiazole established by X-ray analysis is given in Fig. 1. Fractional atomic coordinates and mean temperature factors with ESDs in parentheses for non-hydrogen and hydrogen atoms are listed in Tables 2 and 3 with bond lengths, bond angles and relevant torsion angles in Tables 4-6. The exocyclic C-N bond length of 1.311(3) a which is shorter than the endocyclic one of 1.323(4) 8, the significant difference between the S-C-N bond angles pertaining to the central atom C(2) of the amidine group (S-C< S-C-N,,, (131.9(4)")) and the location of the tautoN endo (107.7(3)") merit proton bound to the endocyclic N(3) show unambigously that the predominant tautomer is the imido form, similar to that invariably exhibited by sulfathiazole in its three polymorphs [ 1, 21, succinoylsulfathiazole [ 31 and phthalimide-(N-sulfanilamido)-thiazole [ 181. From this it follows that the second nitrogen in the hetero ring does not alter the predominant tautomerism of the sulfathiazoles. However, it has an effect upon the S* * *0 close

contact formed between the sulfur of the hetero ring and one of the oxygen atoms of the sulfonyl group. It seems that the counter atom X = C(5) in the quasi-linear triatomic X-S* O=(sulfonyl) system [ 141 gains an increased electronegativity from the neighbouring second nitrogen atom which, in accordance with our earlier observations [13], results in a significantly shorter S* - 0 approach (2.`762(2) A) than those in the related sulfathiazoles [l--3] varying in the range 2.82-3.00 A.

in 2( 4-amino-benzosulfonimido)-5-methyl-3H-l,3,4-thiadiazole and the related sulfathiazoles verus the S"--C * Sv'-O non-bonded torsion angles (Fig. 2) confirms our conclusion that in the formation of the S* * -0 close contacts, beside minor alterations in the corresponding bond lengths and angles, the principal component is the rotation about the Sv'-N bond. The planarity of the additional hetero ring closed by the S* *0 approach simultaneously provides an optimum n( N)--a *( Sv'-O) orbital interaction [19] since the N lone pair and the S(S)-O(lO) bond are antiperiplanar (C(2)-N(7)-S(8)-0( 10) = -0.8( 3)" ) which in turn ought to result in a strong, i.e. a short, Svl- N(sp') multiple bond (about 1.58 A) as suggested by the recent studies [20] of the Sv1-N distances versus the rotation of the SV'[O,O,N,C] tetrahedra about these bonds themselves. The longer SV'-N bond length (1.603(2) A) in accordance with earlier observations [21] and Kalman's conjecture [22] may be attributed to the involvement of the lone pair of the bridging N atom (between the thiadiazole and the sulfonyl moieties) in the intermolecular NH* *N hydrogen bonds formed by pairs in centre of symmetry related molecular dimers: N(3)-H(3)[x, y, z]***N(7)[l -x, 7, Z] where N-·*N = 3.12(l) A, H-*-N = 2.45(3) A and LNH***N = 151(2)". Comparing the corresponding bond lengths and angles pertaining to the "sulfa" groups in 2( 4-amino-benzosufonimido)-5-methyl-3H-l,3,4-thiadiazole and in anhydrous sulfaguanidine [7] it became apparent that there is a through-conjugation between the n-donor terminal -NH2 group (the C-N bond is shorter by 0.045 _A in the title compound than in sulfaguanidine) and the n-acceptor SO2 moiety (the shortening of the Sv'-C bond is 0.03 A) via the phenyl ring, the geometry of which is changed towards a chinoidal

structure. Thus the C-C bonds which are parallel with the C-N and C-S bonds are shorter (av. 1.363(4) a) than the other four C-C bonds (av. 1.391(4) a) whilst the internal angles of the benzene ring at the S and N substituent-bearing atoms are further decreased by 1.1" and 1.6", respectively. This phenomenon, reported, e.g. by Colapietro et al. [23], for p-nitroaniline may presumably be induced by the partial negative charge of the O(10) atom gained through the S ***O close contact. Of course, the alteration in the dn-pn interactions around Sv' as the result of the competitive forces discussed above may also account for this through-conjugation which is absent from the related sulfathiazole and sulfaguanidine structures. In the dimers the N( 3)-H( 3). * -N(7) [ 1 - x, 9, ,z] hydrogen bond pair already discussed is part of two centre of symmetry related three-centered bonds [24]. The other weak hydrogen bonds are maintained by O(9) atoms as acceptors: N(3)-H(3)***0(9)[1 - x, y, Z] where N.--O = 3.24(l) A, H** -0 = 2.58(3) a and LNH* *a 0 = 149(2)". The sum of the bond angles pertaining to the bifurcated H(2) atom is 358". In addition to the dimer-forming hydrogen bonds, two weak hydrogen bonds are also formed in the crystal structure with the protons of the terminal NH, group: N(17)-H(17a)~~~0(10[1/2 + x, y, -l/2 - z] where De-*A = 3.05(l) a, H*.*A = 2.20(3) a and LDH.**A = 170(2)"; N(17)H(17b)*-*N(4)[x, l/2 - y, l/2 + z] where D.--A = 3.09(l) 8, H-*-A = 2.37(2) A and LDH.** A = 168(2)". The relevant dihedral angles formed by the main least-squares planes of the molecule are listed in Table 7.
