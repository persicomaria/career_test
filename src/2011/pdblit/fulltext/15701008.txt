Abstract: The high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin-3 were solved in complex with N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) and the high-affinity inhibitor, methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(3-deoxy-3-[4-methoxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzamido]- -D-galactopyranose)- -Dglucopyranoside, to gain insight into the basis for the affinity-enhancing effect of the 4-methoxy-2,3,5,6tetrafluorobenzamido moiety. The structures show that the side chain of Arg144 stacks against the aromatic moiety of the inhibitor, an interaction made possible by a reorientation of the side chain relative to that seen in the LacNAc complex. Based on these structures, synthesis of second generation LacNAc derivatives carrying aromatic amides at 3-C, followed by screening with a novel fluorescence polarization assay, has led to the identification of inhibitors with further enhanced affinity for galectin-3 (Kd g 320 nM). The thermodynamic parameters describing the binding of the galectin-3 C-terminal to selected inhibitors were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and showed that the affinity enhancements were due to favorable enthalpic contributions. These enhancements could be rationalized by the combined effects of the inhibitor aromatic structure on a cation- interaction and of direct interactions between the aromatic substituents and the protein. The results demonstrate that protein-ligand interactions can be significantly enhanced by the fine-tuning of arginine-arene interactions.

Introduction

The galectins are a family of proteins defined by a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of about 135 amino acids with certain conserved sequence motifs and affinity for galactosides.1,2 They appear to be involved in a wide variety of both extracellular (cell adhesion, induction of cell signaling including apoptosis) and intracellular activities (regulation of growth and apoptosis and RNA-splicing), although in many cases their functions remain unclear (see refs 3-10 and additional

Nevertheless, the galectins have been clearly implicated in physiological and pathological mechanisms in inflammation, immunity5,12-14 and cancer.6,7,10,15 In addition, the modulation of galectin expression or activity has been linked to disease outcome;5,7,16 most recently galectin-2 17 was found to be associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction and galectin-4 18 with inflammatory bowel disease.

Herein we report the 1.6 Å resolution crystal structure of the human galectin-3C in complex with inhibitor 3, the first structure of a galectin-3 complex with a synthetic ligand. Moreover, we have now extended the resolution of the LacNAc complex to 1.4 Å resolution. The crystal structure of the galectin-3C-3 complex points to the importance of an arginine-arene interaction and encouraged us to synthesize a further 56 inhibitors (459) consisting of LacNAc derivatives carrying aromatic amides at 3-C. Evaluation of the galectin-3 inhibitory activity of these inhibitors (4-59) with a novel fluorescence polarization assay26 revealed significantly improved inhibitors with Kd values as low as 320 nM. The thermodynamic parameters describing the binding of these improved inhibitors, determined by isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC), showed that complex formation was enthalpy-driven.
Results and Discussion

reasons, galectin inhibitors would be valuable not only as tools for probing galectin function but also as lead compounds in the future development of therapeutics. Lectin-monosaccharide complexes typically involve two to five hydrogen bonds complemented by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions and are in general weak (Kd's in the millimolar range). Consequently, the design of small highaffinity lectin inhibitors has proven to be a considerable challenge. Since many lectins are oligomeric in nature, the most successful lectin inhibitors, to date, have been multivalent compounds designed to interact with more than one of the lectin's subunits.19-21 Galectin-3, however, is mainly monomeric in solution, albeit in equilibrium with a lower percentage of oligomers,22 and multivalent compounds did not seem to give higher inhibitory potency.23 Therefore, we set out to design highaffinity inhibitors capable of tightly binding monomeric galectin3.24 The approach was based on the fact that the threedimensional structure of the galectin-3 CRD (galectin-3C), in complex with LacNAc,25 had shown that the 3-OH of the galactoside residue points toward an extension of the lactose/ LacNAc binding site thought to be responsible for conferring the selectivity shown by galectin-3 for longer oligosaccharides. Chemical modifications at this position led us to the discovery24 that benzamide substituents at LacNAc 3-C substantially increased the affinity of galectin-3 for these compounds. One inhibitor (3; Figure 1), carrying a 4-methoxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzamido group at 3-C was shown to inhibit intact galectin-3 50 times better than the parent methyl 2-acetamido2-deoxy-4-O- -D-galactopyranose- - D-glucopyranoside (1). The benzamide substitution pattern was concluded to be of critical importance, as the unsubstituted inhibitor 2 was only 15 times better than compound 1.

To understand the structural basis for the high affinity of compound 3 for galectin-3 and hence to obtain information to guide us in the design and synthesis of even better inhibitors, the crystal structures of galectin-3C in complex with LacNAc and 3 were solved and refined at 1.4 and 1.6 Å resolution, respectively. Although these crystals are essentially isomorphous with those reported previously,25 the LacNAc structure was solved by the MAD phasing method using the sodium bromide quick-soak approach as a test of the ability of this method to provide high-quality experimentally determined phase information. Experimental phases were calculated to 2.0 Å resolution, resulting in very high quality electron density maps. The starting point for refinement of the complex with compound 3 was that of the galectin-3C coordinates obtained from the LacNAc complex. (See Supplementary Information for phasing and refinement statistics.) Structure of Galectin-3 in Complex with LacNAc. Overall, the LacNAc complex refined here at 1.4 Å resolution using synchrotron data collected at 100 K agrees well with the structure refined previously at 2.1 Å resolution using data collected on a rotating anode at room temperature.25 Nevertheless, the structure has been improved in a number of ways. First, one more residue (Pro 113) is clearly visible in the electron density at the N-terminus of the molecule. The conformation of the molecule in this region is of interest as it forms the connection to the N-terminal domain unique to galectin-3, a conformation that is not compatible with the subunit interactions found to mediate dimer formation in the canonical dimeric galectins-1 and -2.27-29 Second, the orientations of a number of side chains have been better defined. Among those close to the binding site, the side chain of Arg144 is slightly different in that the guanidino group is rotated about the CN bond and all three nitrogen atoms are now found to form hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules. In addition, the side chain Arg129 is oriented in such a way that it makes a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl terminus of the molecule through its N and NH2. Third, the number of ordered water molecules is

slightly increased in the present high-resolution structure to 180, as compared to the 120 seen at lower resolution. Finally, we observed six residues in alternate conformation, namely, Ile134, Asn179, Asn222, Ser232, Ser244, and Met249. None of these residues is in contact with the LacNAc disaccharide. Excluding the atoms in alternate conformations, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of all atoms between the low- and highresolution structures is 0.26 Å. The high-resolution LacNAc complex structure now includes 137 residues, 180 water molecules, six residues in alternate conformations, one chloride ion, and the LacNAc disaccharide. Structure of Galectin-3 in Complex with Inhibitor 3. Inhibitor 3 is found to bind in the galectin-3C LacNAc binding site with the benzyl substituent in the extended site as expected (Figure 2). The benzamide nitrogen at 3-C of the galactose residue is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule, which is in turn hydrogen-bonded to O1 of Asn160 and NH1 of Arg144 (Figure 3a,b). The benzamide carbonyl oxygen is hydrogenbonded with two water molecules, one of which is further hydrogen-bonded to the N 1 of Trp 181. These interactions with the amido functionality may explain why the corresponding phenyl sulfonamides or ureas at 3-C are less efficient inhibitors.24 Upon binding of inhibitor 3 the only significant change in the galectin-3C structure is the conformational change observed in the side chain of Arg144. The Arg144 guanidino group, which in the complex with LacNAc is involved in a hydrogen bond with water molecules at the galectin-3C surface, is moved 3.5 Å to interact with the benzamido ring of 3 (Figure 3c,d). From being aligned along the galectin-3C surface in the complex with LacNAc, the side chain of Arg144 adopts an all-staggered conformation and points out toward the solvent in the complex with 3. This type of ligand-induced change in conformation is an example of one of the complications associated with the structure-based approached to ligand design as recently reviewed.30 The central carbon (C ) of the Arg144 guanidino group is stacked on one side of the benzamido ring at a distance of 3.5-4.2 Å from the carbon atoms of the aromatic ring. On the other side of the benzamido ring, two water molecules are found within 4.5 Å of its centroid. Additionally, one edge of the benzamido ring sits in an extended nonpolar pocket formed by the side chains of Arg144(C to C), Ala146(C ), and Asn160(C ). This extended nonpolar pocket thus emerged as

an attractive target for the design of further optimized inhibitors as described below. The complex with inhibitor 3 shows that the side chain of Arg144 makes what appears to be a cation- interaction31 with the benzyl substituent of the inhibitor. The 4.3 Å distance seen between N of the arginine side chain and the centroid of the benzamido ring is in the range of what has previously been observed for arene-guanidino distances within proteins structures.32 Cation- interactions have now been shown to be important in protein stability, ligand binding, and enzyme catalysis and typically, Arg side chains, Lys side chains, metal ions, or ligand cations are found to interact with the side chains of Trp, Tyr, or Phe.33-35 Experiments designed to measure the strength of cation- interactions in biological systems have shown that they range from -0.4 to -2.4 kcal/mol.35 Given that fluorinated arenes have electron-poor -systems (in fact, the quadrupole moment of 4-methoxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzamide is small according to ab initio calculations) and thus form weak cation- interactions,36,37 it may seem surprising that the affinity-enhancing effect of the 4-methoxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzamido-guanidino interaction is so large. However, it has been shown that the electrostatic attraction between the cation and the permanent quadrupole moment of the  system does not account entirely for the observed energetics in systems involving cation- interactions31,35 and that van der Waals interations,38 - interactions, charge-transfer effects, and polarization effects must also be considered. In this case, the methoxy group of 3 is positioned close to the guanidino group of Arg144, which may allow for additional electrostatic interactions that further increase the affinity.39 Moreover, fluorinated hydrocarbons are poorly solvated in water and desolvation of the 4-methoxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzamido moiety can be expected to contribute substantially to the affinity of 3 for galectin-3. Synthesis of Second Generation Inhibitors. Earlier studies in natural systems37,40 and in minimalized artificial systems in water41 and organic solvents39,42 have concluded that electronwithdrawing substituents (i.e. fluorine or nitro) on the aromatic component weaken while electron-donating substituents (i.e. dimethylamino) strengthen cation- interactions, observations that suggest that the -electron density of the aromatic component is of primary importance. To investigate the influence of the structure of the aromatic component of an argininearene cation- interaction in a natural system and to discover further improved inhibitors of galectin-3, we prepared 42

potential LacNAc-based inhibitors all having aromatic amides at 3-C (4-46, Figure 4) following our recently described procedure.24 Galectin-3 Inhibition in a Competitive Fluorescence Polarization Assay. A novel high-throughput galectin-3 solution phase assay based on fluorescence polarization26,43 was employed to evaluate compounds 4-46. Indeed, the chemical nature of the benzamido moiety strongly affects the interaction, as the inhibitory powers of 4-46 varied significantly. All compounds 4-46 were better than the unsubstituted LacNAc methyl glycoside 1 (Kd ) 67 µM), and 35 was better than the unsubstituted parent benzamido derivative 2 (Kd ) 6.7 µM). Although several (15, 24, 32, 34, 37; Kd ) 0.95-1.3 µM) were similar to 3 in affinity for galectin-3, only two compounds (41 and 44; Kd ) 0.48 and 0.32 µM, respectively) were better than 3 (Kd ) 0.88 µM). If it is assumed that the aromatic moieties of the good inhibitors stack against the Arg144 guanidino group in a manner similar to that of 3, conclusions can be drawn concerning the effects of the arene structure and substitution pattern on the cation- interaction. In general, we see that para- and metasubstitution of the benzamide is beneficial, while ortho(43) Sorme, P.; Kahl-Knutsson, B.; Huflejt, M.; Nilsson, U. J.; Leffler, H.

substitution is detrimental to the interaction with galectin-3. Fluorination (4-7) of the aromatic ring results in inhibitors whose affinities are worse than the parent unsubstituted benzamide 2.24 This is probably due to a decrease in the -electron density in the fluorinated benzamides and thus a decrease in the cation- interaction strength. As a consequence, the p-methoxy group of 3 can be concluded to be essential for high affinity. Methoxy-substitution at the meta-position is beneficial; the m-methoxy group of 9 can be expected to form favorable direct (oxygen) electrostatic interactions with the guanidino group of Arg144, as well as to fill the cleft formed by Arg144 C to C. Presumably p-methoxy (10) is somewhat less efficient than m-methoxy (9) at making favorable direct interactions due to the increased distance from the guanidino group and the cleft formed by Arg144 C to C. o-Methoxy-substitution (8) gives inhibitory power worse than no substitution (2). The observation that two o-methoxy substituents (12) are detrimental to galectin-3 binding is not unexpected, since, upon stacking of the Arg144 guanidino group onto the aromatic ring, one or the other of the two methoxy groups would interfere with the protein surface. The observation that the introduction of two m-methoxy groups (15) leads to an activity surpassing that of 3 seemed surprising at first, because if 15 forms a complex with galectin-3

Kd values (µM) as determined by a competitive fluorescence polarization assay were determined at 8 µM inhibitor concentration and are shown in brackets. *Kd for 44 had to be determined at 1.6 µM concentration of 44 because of its high affinity, and the Kd for 4, 12, and 55 had to be determined at 40 µM concentration because of their low affinities for galectin-3.

structurally similar to that of 3, then one of the methoxy groups would point more or less into bulk solution. However, the presence of two symmetrically placed methoxy groups would, of course, be entropically favorable, because two degenerate conformers of 15 would interact with galectin-3 with the same enthalpic contribution. Compound 17 also carries two mmethoxy groups, in addition to a p-methoxy group, but it is significantly less active than 15. However, in 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene rings, the methoxy groups are typically arranged alternatively up and down relative to the benzene ring, a geometry that would result in a steric clash in a galectin-3-17 complex structurally similar to that of galectin-3-3. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that 21 is a slightly better inhibitor than 14. In 21 the methylene bridge between the m- and p-oxygens can adopt an orientation similar to the methyl group of 9.

Taken together, simply introducing an electron-donating methoxy functionality on an aromatic partner in an areneguanidino interaction does not automatically lead to enhanced interaction. The direct electrostatic and steric interactions of the introduced substituent with the protein surface can overshadow electron-donating effects and have to be taken into consideration, as do the effects of the substituent on ligand conformational preferences. In the small arginine receptors studied by Schrader, for example, it has been suggested that the direct electrostatic interactions between the aromatic methoxy group and the arginine guanidino group were more important than the cation- interactions in stabilizing the complexes.39 Their hypothesis was supported by electrostatic potential calculations, which gave similar results with benzene and anisole. The electron-donating dimethylamino-substituent in the paraposition (26) only marginally improves the inhibitor affinity.

This result may be explained by the fact that, compared to the p-methoxy compound (10) discussed above, it is sterically less complementary to the hydrophobic cleft formed by Arg144 C to C. m-Dimethylamino substition as in compound 25 does not affect the inhibitory power, presumably because such a substituent would have to be positioned away from the Arg144 side chain for steric reasons. Furthermore, the higher degree of protonation of the dimethylamino substituent at near-neutral pH, as compared to the methoxy, negatively influences both a direct electrostatic interaction with the guanidino group and the indirect interaction via electron donation to the benzene ring. Unprotonated dimethylamino-substitution has been shown to enhance cation- interactions in an artificial model system in chloroform.42 Among the other substituents investigated, only p-nitro (24), p-methyl (32), p-tert-butyl (34), and p-acetyl (37) give rise to high-affinity inhibitors. The nitro-substituent of 24 extends the -system of the benzamido group closer to the Arg144 residue, thus leading to an improved interaction with the Arg144 guanidino group. However, the possibility that the nitro group forms direct bidentate interactions with the Arg144 guanidino group in a structurally different fashion cannot be excluded. Surprisingly, p-carboxy substitution (39) results in a rather small affinity enhancement, although it can be regarded as an isostere of 24. Among the larger aromatic systems, 2-naphthamides proved to be exceptionally good at enhancing the affinity for galectin3. The 2-naphthamido derivatives 41 and 44 are well-suited to forming a cation- interaction with the Arg144 guanidino group and to fill the hydrophobic cleft lined by Arg144 C C. Large and more polarizable -systems typically form strong cation- interactions.35,39 The o-carboxy substituent of 44 has only a small affinity-enhancing effect, but it may be useful as a means of increasing the solubility of the inhibitors. The heteroaromatic amides, exemplified by the indol 29 and pyrroles 27 and 28, are surprisingly poor even though indol (i.e. Trp) is common in protein cation- interactions and pyrrole is an electron-rich -system. This suggests that the benzamideArg144 interaction is indeed specific and very sensitive to the exact positioning of the -system, a conclusion supported by the observation that phenylacetamide 11, 1-naphthamide 42, and naphthylacetamide 43 are less efficient inhibitors. The Kd of 320 nM for 44 is more than 2 orders of magnitude better than that of the parent LacNAc 1 (Kd ) 67 µM) and represents an unusually high affinity for a monovalent ligandlectin interaction. The excellent inhibitory power of the dimethoxy-substituted 15 suggested the synthesis of even further optimized inhibitors by means of replacing the methoxy with other alkoxy groups. The synthesis of 13 derivatives (47-59) did indeed show that 3,5-dialkoxy-substitution of the benzamide was beneficial for complex formation as 11 of them were better inhibitors than the unsubstituted reference compound 2. However, none of them was better than the 3,5-methoxy-substituted benzamide 15. Thermodynamic Studies on Galectin-3: Inhibitor Complexes. To further characterize the underlying basis for the affinity-enhancing effect of the 3-benzamido-substitution of LacNAc, three of the best inhibitors (15, 24, and 32), with suitably high water-solubility, were selected for ITC experiments. Only a few thermodynamic studies on galectin-ligand

interactions have been described in the literature,23,44-49 and the present study is the first to analyze small synthetic inhibitors with galectin-3C. Notably, the best monovalent ligand described, to date, is the blood group A tetrasaccharide with Kd ) 72 µM (as compared to 191 µM for LacNAc).47 The isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments were performed with galectin3C to avoid the possibility that the N-terminal domain of intact galectin-3 might mediate higher order oligomers.22,50 In addition, galectin-3C is considerably more soluble than intact galectin3. The methyl glycoside of N-acetyllactosamine 1 was included in the experiments as a reference ligand; it was found to have Kd ) 82 µM, a value lower than that obtained with reducing N-acetyllactosamine and intact galectin-3 47 (Kd ) 191 µM). It should also be noted that the Kd values obtained for the various compounds by ITC are approximately 5-fold higher than those obtained by fluorescence polarization (the relative affinities are essentially identical). Although the basis for this difference is not known, the fluorescence polarization experiments were performed on intact galectin-3 where effects arising from the N-terminal domainssuch as oligomerizationsmay be important. The optimized inhibitors 15, 24, and 32 exhibited Kd values of 5.0, 4.8, and 5.7 µM, respectively, in the ITC experiments, an approximate 15-fold increase in affinity compared to the parent methyl glycoside of N-acetyllactosamine 1 (84 µM). These increases correspond to a change in binding free energy (G) of approximately 1.7 kcal/mol, a value that agrees well with that observed for cation- interactions in other biological systems.35,37 As shown in Table 1, these changes are a direct reflection of changes in the enthalpy of binding (H between 1.6 and 2.4 kcal/mol). In two cases, the favorable enthalpy changes are offset somewhat by unfavorable changes in entropy51-53 relative to compound 1 (i.e. 24 and 32 with S ) 0.5 and 0.8 kcal/mol, respectively). Interestingly, the m,mdimethoxy-substituted benzamido derivative 15 displays no entropy penalty relative to the parent LacNAc 1.
Conclusions

Analysis of high-resolution crystallographic data, together with synthesis and evaluation of a large panel of benzamido derivatives and ITC measurements, provides important information about inhibitor-galectin-3 interactions, which is essential

Cation- Interactions in Lectin-Ligand Complexes

ARTICLES

for the development of inhibitors with higher affinity and specificity. In particular, an Arg144-arene stacking that involves a cation- interaction appears to be of importance for high affinity, which suggests that exploitation and fine-tuning of cation- interactions may very well emerge as a more general strategy toward the enhancement of protein-ligand interactions. However, the present work also reenforces the fact that direct interactions of the arene substituents with the protein surface are also very important in the inhibitor design process. In addition, the synthesis of potent specific monovalent inhibitors of galectin-3, as described herein, provides valuable research tools as well as an advance toward the goal of developing galectin-based therapeutic drugs.
