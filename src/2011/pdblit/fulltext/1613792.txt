Received July 14, 1976 The amino acid sequence of human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor [Pubols, M. H., Bartelt, D. C., and Greene, L. J. (1974) J. Biol. Chem., 249, 2235-22421 was determined by a combination of selective trypsin and chymotrypsin hydrolysis reactions on the S-2-aminoethylcysteinyl inhibitor and conventional methods (subtractive Edman degradation and exopeptidase hydrolysis) for sequence determination of small peptides. The peptides were ordered on the basis of the identification of the amino and carboxyterminal residues of the products at each stage of the degradation procedure. The sequence determination was carried out on a mixture of chromatographic forms present in both tissue and pancreatic juice which are identical in amino acid composition, aminoterminal residues, molecular weight, and specific activity, but differ only in asparagine content and susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis. The amino acid sequence of the human inhibitor corresponding to chromatographic form A3 has been shown to be NH,Asp-Ser-Leu-Gly-Arg-Glu-Ala-Lys-Cys-Tyr-Asn-Glu-Leu-Asn-Gly-Cys-Thr-LysIle-Tyr-Asn-Pro-Val-Cys-Gly-Thr-A~p-Gly-Asp-Thr-T~-Pro-Asn-G~u-Cys-~alLeu-Cys-Phe-Glu-Asn-arg-Lys-Arg-Gln-Thr-Ser-Ile-Leu-Ile-Gln-Lys-Ser-GlyPro-Cys-COOH.

Human PST1 is present in both pancreatic juice and tissue in multiple chromatographic forms, each having the same amino acid composition, amino-terminal sequence, specific activity, and molecular weight, but differing in asparagine content and susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis (3, 4). In this paper we report the amino acid sequence determination of human PST1 carried out on a mixture of multiple chromatographic forms and compare its structure with homologous inhibitors.

enzymatic cleavage reactions summarized in Fig. 1. This approach closely followed that used for the determination of the amino acid sequence of porcine pancreatic secretory inhibitor I (5). Argine-directed trypsin cleavage was achieved by blocking the E- and o-amino groups of lysine and SZ-aminoethylcysteine with maleic anhydride (6). Selective hydrolysis of lysyl bonds in peptides also containing S-2-aminoethylcysteine was accomplished by trypsin hydrolysis at pH 11 .O (7).

each stage. The quantitative data upon which the sequence determination is based are given in the tables and figures of the Supplement.5 The salient features of the study will be discussed here. The limited number of peptides produced at each stage of the degradation were separated by gel filtration and, with one exception, were sticiently homogeneous for sequence analysis. The mixture containing Peptides III and IV required further purification of SP-Sephadex C-25 by gradient and step elution chromatography (Fig. 4). The intermediate peptides, usually two or three, were ordered on the basis of the identification of the aminoand carboxy-terminal residues. Four peptides (I through n7; cf. Fig. 1, line 2) were obtained in only one stage of the degradation. In this case, the specificity of trypsin was used to assign Peptide II, which does not contain arginine, to the carboxy-terminus of the maleated parent peptide. The final set of small peptides were sequenced by subtractive Edman degradation and by analysis of the rates of release of free amino acids by carboxypeptidase A, B, or Y and aminopeptidase M. The sequence determination was carried out on a mixture of chromatographic forms of human PSTI. Before being combined, the individual components were shown to be identical in amino acid composition, amino-terminal sequence, and molecular weight (SDS-acrylamide gel electrophoresis) and to be devoid of glucosamine. They differed in asparagine content, susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis and in those chromatographic and electrophoretic properties which would be expected to reflect differences in net charge (3, 4) (cf. Assignment of Amides below). No evidence of allotypic variation was found in the primary structure of human PSTI, i.e., in the sites of specific cleavage used in the preparation of the peptides or in the sequence determination of the peptides.
`Some of the data are presented as a miniprint supplement immediately following this paper, including Figs. 3-11 and Tables I-XIII. 6 We estimate that if a set of polymorphic peptides had been present with one component at the level of 20% or more, it would have been detected even if the peptides had not been separated.

The assignment of the sequence: Glyz8Asp2s-Th130 is based on a single determination taken in the later stages of the carboxypeptidase Y hydrolysis of Peptide I-A-l-a (Fig. 10) and is supported by homology with bovine, porcine, and ovine PST1 which have glycine and threonine in positions 28 and 30, respectively (cf. Fig. 2). The instability of S-aminoethylcysteine on acid hydrolysis during subtractive Edman degradation was reflected in the low recoveries of S-aminoethylcysteine in some peptides. This was especially evident in the sequence determination of Peptide IB-l (Residues 9 through 16) which contained 2 residues of S-aminoethylcysteine. The total enzymatic hydrolysate contained 1.50 mol of S-aminoethylcysteine/mol of peptide, whereas only 0.78 mol of S-aminoethylcysteine/mol of peptide were recovered in the acid hydrolysate. Low recoveries of&`-aminoethylcysteine were also observed in the Edman degradation of the peptide. The sequence of the peptide was provided by the demonstration by hydrolysis with aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase B that S-aminoethylcysteine occupies positions 9 and 16, when taken together with the results of six cycles of subtactive Edman degradation (Table VI).
Assignment of Amides

The amide forms of the dicarboxylic acids were determined by enzymatic hydrolysis of the peptides and the positive identification of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or their amide forms. Residue 45 (Peptide 11-A) was identified as pyrrolidone carboxylic acid. This residue was assigned as glutamine in the amino acid sequence because amino-terminal glutamine residues undergo cyclization to pyrrolidone carboxylic acid under the acidic conditions employed for the isolation of the peptide and because the NH, terminal residues of both Peptide II and II A were unreactive toward phenylisothiocyanate under the usual conditions of the Edman degradation. The same behavior was observed for the homologous peptides from bovine and porcine PSTI. This residue was positively identified as glutamine in the determination of the overlap peptides of

bovine PST1 [cf. (511. The limitations in the availability of human PST1 made it necessary to carry out this sequence determination on a mixture of the chromatographic forms differing in asparagine content and susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis. Since gel filtration was used in all but one of the purification steps, no fractionation of peptides reflecting the amide heterogeneity was expected. Ten of the fourteen dicarboxylic acids, including all of the six glutamic acid residues were assigned without ambiguity. This indicates that the asparagine-aspartic acid heterogeneity was localized in specific residues and not distributed randomly. Peptides I-B-1 (Table VI) and 1-A-l-P (Table IX) were incompletely hydrolyzed by the mixture of enzymes used. In both cases, three times as much asparagine was recovered as aspartic acid. On this basis, asparagine has been assigned to Residues

11 and 14 (Pepitde I-B-1) and Residue 21 (Peptide I-A-l-@ and because of the known chemistry of asparagine peptides, i.e., asparagine (especially when followed by glycine) may cyclize to the imide form and/or (Y- and P-aspartyl peptide bond forms (8), and because the asparagine could not be formed from the aspartic acid under the experimental conditions employed [see also (3) and (4) for discussion of the chemistry of asparagine peptides]. Residue 27, the remaining amino acid, for which no experimental data concerning the amide content are available, was assigned as aspartic acid on the basis of the difference between the five asparagine and three aspartic acid residues present in Form A3 l(3), table III and the five asparagine and two aspartic acid residues which had already been assigned. The amide distribution of human PST1 given in Fig. 2; therefore, represents the amide distribu-

tion of Form A3, the most highly amidated form of human PSTI, which was the only one completely digested by enzymatic hydrolysis. It should be noted that it was possible to make the assignment of amides for these mixtures of peptides derived from a mixture of the chromatographic forms of human PST1 only because the asparagineaspartic acid heterogeneity was localized in specific residues and because data were available for the amide content of Form As.
Amino Acid Sequence of Human PSTI

The amino acid sequence of human PST1 is given in Fig. 2, top line. The structures of the homologous inhibitors of porcine (5, 9), bovine (lo), and ovine (11) origin are included for comparison. The inhibitors contain 56 amino acid residues per molecule arranged in a linear polypeptide chain. The six half-cysteine residues occupy identical positions in each of the polypeptide chain. The disulfide pairings CysgCys3*, Cy~`~-Cys~~, and Cy~~~-Cys~~ have been demonstrated for both porcine (11) and bovine (12) PST1 and would be expected to be the same for the human and ovine inhibitors. A striking feature of the inhibitory properties of this homologous series of inhibitors (bovine, porcine, and human PSTI) is their differential activity toward human trypsins which is not expressed toward bovine or porcine trypsins (3, 13-16). In the absence of crystallographic information, an analysis of the relationships between primary structure and activity must necessarily be incomplete. However, the differential activity can be considered in terms of information derived from the crystal structures of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PSTI)-bovine trypsin complex (17, 18) and the soybean trypsin inhibitor (ST&porcine trypsin complex (19). Both complexes have a covalent bond (tetrahedral intermediate) between the catalytic serine residue of trypsin and the carbonyl of the P, residue7 (lysine or argi`The notation of Schechter and Berger (20) is used.

nine) of tht reactive site of the inhibitor. Although there are differences in the amino acid sequence of PTI and ST1 at their reactive sites, there are great similarities between the conformations of the main chain of this region of the inhibitors in their respective complexes. The stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate and the extremely strong association constants observed are achieved by only a few enzyme-inhibitor contacts with those residues of the inhibitor which are immediately adjacent to the reactive site of the inhibitor. The inhibitor reactive site8 PI-PI' (Residues 18-19) is Lys-Ile for human and porcine PST1 and Arg-Ile for the bovine and ovine inhibitors. The other amino acids in the area of the reactive site (Residues 1528) are identical, with the only exception being the P2 position (Residue 17) where threonine occurs in human PST1 and proline in the other three species. The utilization of residues adjacent to the reactive site for contact tc trypsin observed for the PTI and ST1 complexes suggests that the P,-P, sequence probably plays a significant role in the interaction of the PSTI's and trypsins. These differences in P,-P, which exist in the PST1 series may explain why human PST1 (Thr17-Lys18) is an extremely effective inhibitor of both human trypsins, whereas bovine PST1 (Pro17Argls) is several orders of magnitude weaker and the porcine inhibitor (Pro17Ly@) is effective but not as strong as the human inhibitor (3, 13-16). It should be possible to test this speculation with homologous inhibitors having the appropriate amino acid sequence in this region of the molecule, by enzymatic mutation (alteration of reactive site) as described by Laskowski and his collaborators (25) or by crystallographic studies. A discussion of the evolution of the specificity of proteinase inhibitors and a classification criterion for the description of mammalian trypsins and secretory trypsin inhibitors is given in
(16).
*This has been demonstrated by the limited proteolytic cleavage of the bovine (21) and porcine (22) PST1 by catalytic amounts of trypsin at acid pH [cf. (23) and (24) for recent reviews].
