NOE R Factors and Structural Refinement Using FIRM, an Iterative Relaxation Matrix Program
STEPHEN P. EDMONDSON

Department of Medical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, College of Science, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois 62901 Received August 16, 199 1; revised October 24. 199 1 A program called FIRM (full iterative relaxation matrix) for calculating NOE intensities and for NMR structure refinement, including contributions from internal motions, is described. Simulated NOE data setswith and without random noise were constructed for models of two proteins, motilin (22 amino acids) and parvalbumin ( 108 amino acids). NOE R factors were computed for structures with varying degrees of similarity to the motilin and parvalbumin models. The NOE R factor for random structures ranged from 0.8 to 1.3, and the R factor for accurate structures ranged from 0.31 to 0.39. Extended chain structures of motilin and parvalbumin were refined with the simulated NOE data sets using FIRM, distance geometry, and restrained molecular dynamics. Random noise and the choice of NOE data set had little effect on refinement. The results demonstrate that low R factors are not sufficient criteria for judging the successof a structural refinement from sparse NOE data. 0 1992 Academic PIW, I~C.

Molecular structure determination and refinement using NMR are based on the distance information contained in the intensities of the cross peaks in 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) . Under the two-spin approximation, NOE intensity is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between nuclei (1, 2). However, the two-spin approximation neglects the indirect transfer of magnetization among neighboring spins (spin diffusion), which can be significant. A more sophisticated method that takes into account the effects of spin diffusion is the relaxation matrix approach, and these types of calculations are becoming routine procedures in NMR structure determination (3-8). In the simplest implementation, the 2D NOE is calculated for a refined model and compared to the experimental NOE spectrum. More elaborate and potentially more powerful uses of relaxation matrix calculations include direct least-squares minimization of NOE intensities ( 9)) incorporation into molecular mechanic (MM) and molecular dynamic (MD) structure refinement routines (5, IO), and accurate back-calculation of interproton distances from experimental NOE data (11). The ability to calculate an accurate NOESY spectrum of a molecular model gives NMR structure determination a quantitative basis comparable to that enjoyed by Xray structure determination. The early practice of judging the quality of structure determination by convergence to a unique structure (by perhaps several methods from several different starting structures) was only qualitative at best; rather, it is the error between the model's NOE and the experimental data that should determine the success

of a structure refinement ( 22). However, since the NMR spectroscopist does not have access to all the NOE data (due to overlapping and unassigned peaks), agreement between calculated and experimental NOES may not be a reliable indicator in all cases. Therefore, it may be necessary to meet both criteria: small residual error between calculated and measured NOES and convergence to a unique structure. In this paper, a program called FIRM (for full iterative relaxation matrix) is described for calculating 2D NOESY intensities by the relaxation matrix method. An early version of the program has been used previously to help refine the structure of motilin, a 22-amino-acid gastrointestinal hormone (13). In this report, the program is used to calculate simulated NOE data sets for a defined model of motilin, and NOE R factors (error functions) are determined for structures with various degrees of similarity to the model. These data are used to establish criteria for judging the usefulness of NOE R-factor values. Finally, the ability of FIRM to iteratively refine the structure of motilin (22 amino acids) and parvalbumin ( 108 amino acids) is tested using extended chains as starting structures. NOE data sets are constructed with superimposed noise, and structure refinement is accomplished with pseudoatom-based distance geometry (DG) and restrained MD. Structure refinement using relaxation matrix methods has been tested with simulated NOE data by others (6, 11, 14, 15)) and this report will complement those studies with emphasis on possible sources of error.

where T, is the usual isotropic (molecular tumbling) correlation time and S is an empirical term analogous to the order parameter of Lipari and Szabo (5,16). Equation [ 41 facilitates the incorporation of internal motions into NOE calculations by assigning diIIerent correlation times to different protons via an order parameter. In this study, all protons were assigned a value of S = 1.O. If the rotation of methyl groups about their axes is faster than isotropic molecular tumbling, the spectral density functions for a single proton i to one proton j of a spinning methyl rotor are ( 17)

For interactions between two different methyl rotors, it4 = N and thus J, is averaged over all NM = 9 possible interactions. Each methyl proton of each methyl group is considered separately. An advantage of treating each methyl proton explicitly instead of using a pseudoatom is that R is symmetrical and the similarity transform suggested by Olejniczak (20) need not be applied. To account for flipping of aromatic rings, the relaxation rates for a proton i to the two equivalent aromatic protonsj, and j2 were averaged as described by Koning et al.

(21). The same procedure was used for interactions between two different aromatic groups but R, was averaged over Z'j, , ii j, , iz j, , and j,i, . i The program, called FIRM for I?& iterative relaxation matrix, was written in Fortran 77 and was run on a Silicon Graphics 4D/G25 Personal IRIS workstation. On the IRIS, FIRM computes the NOE in less than a minute for molecules containing 200 protons and about 80 minutes for a large protein with 800 protons. Matrix diagonalization is accomplished with a modified Householder reduction algorithm, and LU decomposition with implicit shifts is used for matrix inversion. The program incorporates an iterative refinement procedure similar to that of IRMA (4)) MARDIGRAS (6), and MORASS ( 7)) in which experimental NOES are merged (substituted) in the NOES calculated from a structural model; interproton distances corrected for the effects of spin diffusion may then be back-calculated from this hybrid NOE matrix. FIRM was designed with an interactive interface but can be run in batch mode by redirecting input and output. Facilities are provided for manual refinement and automatic refinement using a predefined set of rules. Refinement against a set of NOES with different mixing times is handled in a flexible and efficient way. Options are provided for including a leakage term for other relaxation pathways, scaling over all experimental NOES or over a selected subset of NOES, superimposing random noise on the calculated NOES, and simulating methyl spinning with an N-site jumping model. (Currently, a 12-site jumping model is supported by FIRM but this study used the simpler 3-site jumping model.) Poorly conditioned matrices of merged NOES that give negative eigenvalues are handled either by merging a fraction of the experimental NOES or by adding a small correction term to the diagonal intensities. Internal motions may be simulated by assigning an order parameter to individual or groups of protons. NOE and relaxation matrices are written to unformatted files at each FIRM cycle to permit a restart from previous computations. Input to FIRM consists of a model structure in PDB format, mixing time, and correlation times. If an experimental NOE file is input, NOE R factors are computed, and the experimental NOES may be merged into the calculated NOE matrix. If no NOE file is input, the mixing time may be varied without rediagonalizing the relaxation matrix. At any stage of the calculation NOE intensity and/or distance files may be output. The output distance file consists of the back-calculated distances, original model distances, calculated NOES, experimental NOES, and a term giving the estimated error in the back-calculated distances ( eO). The NOES/distances that are output may be specified by either an input file listing selected proton pairs (e.g., experimental NOES) or by the computed NOE intensity. R Factors The agreement between calculated and "experimental" NOES was assessed by defining an R factor (not to be confused with the relaxation matrix R) analogous to the residual index used in X-ray diffraction (15), R NoE = c IA-Al c IA,J '

where A, and A, are the observed and calculated NOES, respectively. A mean error (or fractional deviation) can also be defined as D NOE
=

To minimize anomalous effects from zero intensities and small calculated values, the magnitudes of A, and A, in Eqs. [ 81 were restricted to a minimum value of 0.0002. This gives a range for A-`j6 in I!!&. [ 8b] of 1.O to 4.1, and in the two-spin approximation corresponds to an NOE between two protons 5 A apart with t, = 50 ms and 7, = 1 ns. NOES less than 0.0002 will rarely be encountered unless one wants to include zero-intensity NOES in the experimental data or the starting structure is very bad. The mean error between structures at various steps of refinement and the "true" structure (or model) was evaluated by DA(orDH)=kC * d-d 7, 0 I [91

I

where d, and d, are the interatomic distances in the structure at some stage of the refinement and the corresponding distances in the original model, respectively. The distances for DA and DH were summed over all atom-atom distances and over the interproton distances corresponding to measured NOES, respectively. NOE Data Sets A motilin model previously derived from DG and MD refinement of NOE data (13) was taken as "the real" structure of the molecule for the purposes of this study. The accuracy of the model is irrelevant in this context; rather, we assume this structure for the molecule and use it as a reference to compute R factors and to assess the successof refinement procedures. This defined structure will be referred to throughout this study as the motilin model. Three different sets of simulated (experimental) NOES were computed from the motilin model. Set A consisted of NOES with intensities greater than 0.0075. The summed intensities were used for equivalent aromatic and methyl protons, and only a few intraresidue NOES were retained. There were a total of 483 H-H NOES in set A, or 243 when converted into pseudoatom-based NOES. Out of the 243 pseudoatom NONES, were intraresidue. Set B consisted of NOES among HA, HN, and HB protons 50 greater than 0.002 (with HB-HB NOES excluded) and NOES between HA/HN/HB and side-chain protons greater than 0.005. There were 586 H-H NOES in this set, or 375~when converted into pseudoatoms, with 60 being intraresidue NOES. Set C consisted of all NOES greater than 0.002 and contained 139 1 H-H NOES. NOES involving side-chain NH, SH, and OH protons, protons on adjacent carbons of the side chains, and the distal protons of long side-chain amino acids were excluded from each set of

288

simulated NOES. The isotropic and methyl rotor correlation times were 2 and 0.1 ns, respectively, and the mixing time was 0.25 s. NOE data sets were constructed with random noise (square distribution) superimposed on the simulated NOES. Set A,, was generated by adding a random number between kO.0025 to each NOE of set A. This corresponds to a noise level that is 33% of the minimum NOE intensity. Set B, was generated by adding a random number between +O.OOl to each NOE of set B. This corresponds to a noise level that is 50% of the minimum NOE intensity. Data sets A,, and B, were used to simulate the type of measured NOES that might be used in a FIRM refinement procedure.

Refinement
FIRM refinement consisted of filling the sparse matrix of experimental NOES with values calculated from a structural model as described by Borgias and James (6). This "hybrid" NOE matrix, A,, was diagonalized to back-calculate the relaxation matrix
XA,X-' = D

[lOI
Interproton distances corresponding to observed NOE intensities were then calculated from R, by Eqs. [ 21 and [ 3 ] and used to derive distance constraints for structural refinement. Since the relaxation matrix approach takes into account the effects of spin diffusion among all protons, distances obtained in this fashion should reflect the true interproton distances more accurately than simple re6 scaling. However, the backcalculated distances will also reflect the starting structure, and thus FIRM refinement must be cycled iteratively with structural refinement. The merged NOE matrix, A,, was obtained from experimental NOES and NOES calculated from a starting model,
A, = fCA, + ( 1 -f)Ac A, = A,

for NOE, > 0 for NOE, = 0,

where f is the fraction of experimental NOE to merge and C is a scaling constant. C was calculated by normalizing the experimental to the calculated intensities over all measured NOES or over a range of selected NOES. A new R, was calculated by Eq. [lo], and the cross-relaxation rates involving aromatic protons were averaged. All R, that did not correspond to measured NOES were replaced by those from the starting structure and Rii recomputed from Eq. [ 2b] using the appropriate J,,. A new A, was calculated and the procedure repeated until an acceptable error between A, and A, was obtained. At this point distances were calculated from R using the isotropic spectral density function Eq. [ 31. For distance geometry and molecular mechanics/dynamics calculations, pseudoatom distance constraints were generated from the distances obtained by FIRM using the pseudoatom correction factors listed in Table 1. Residual errors between A, and A, were used to estimate errors in the back-calculated distances by (6)

Note. The lower/upper correction terms are subtracted/added to back-calculated distances to account for pseudoatom constraints between different types of proton groups. Data are taken from comparisons of back-calculated distances with true distances (22). A minimum error of +0.2 A was assumed.

where a is the smaller of A,(U) and A,-(ij). The value of e0 (in angstroms) was added to the upper constraint distance if positive and added to the lower constraint distance if negative. Typically, eii averaged less than 0.1 A after one cycle of FIRM refinement, but occasional values as high as 3 A were found. An additional +0.4 A was added to the distance bounds during the early stages of refinement, where the back-calculated distances are less accurate and gradually reduced to zero. DG calculations were done with DIANA (23). Twenty structures were created using the minimization parameters suggested in the DIANA manual. This consisted of seven minimization stages, the first five with 100 iterations and the last two with 200 iterations, in which the scope of the constraints gradually increased to include longer-range interactions. The structure with the best DIANA target function was selected as the starting structure for the next stage of FIRM or MM/MD refinement. Restrained MM/MD was performed with AMBER 3.OA (24-26) modified to use a flatwell potential ( 7) for the NOE constraint energy, ENor,

where &or is the "force constant" for the constraint violation and d, d,, d, are the inter-proton distance and lower and upper constraint distances, respectively. To avoid problems with dynamic simulations at high temperature, a restart option was added to AMBER, where a new random-number generator seed based on the system clock was used if the dynamic trajectory became unstable. A set of amino acid residues using pseudoatoms was added to the AMBER unitedatom database. These pseudoatoms were placed at the geometric center of the protons that they represented: amine, methylene, methyl, and propyl (Val and Leu) groups. Chiral protons (such as Ha) were also represented by pseudoatoms, and ring carbon atoms were used for the aromatic residues. The pseudoatoms were given zero charge,

290

no nonbonded terms, and a mass corresponding to the group of protons that they represented. The other force field parameters for the pseudoatoms were chosen to keep the pseudoatoms at their proper positions while minimizing the effects on the standard AMBER united-atom force field. To reduce electrostatic contributions, the atomic partial charges of all side-chain atoms of Arg, Asp, Glu, His+, and Lys residues were reduced to approximately 20% of their normal values. This set of amino acid parameters will be referred to as the pseudo/united-atom force field. All MM/MD calculations used a distance-dependent dielectric constant, a nonbonded cutoff of 8 A, the l-4 interactions scaled down by a factor of 2, and an update of the nonbonded pairs after every 25 cycles/steps. MD simulations were performed with SHAKE using a step size of 0.002 ps and a temperature bath coupling constant of 0.1. The starting structure for MM/MD refinement was an all-atom model from DG or a previous MM/MD run. The MM/MD refinement strategy consisted of 100 cycles of MM with the pseudo/united-atom force field and no constraints; 1000 cycles of restrained MM with a flatwell potential of KNoE = 1 kcal/ A 2; 100 cycles of restrained MM with SHAKE; a series of restrained MD simulations with increasing flatwell potentials; 1000 cycles of restrained MM and no SHAKE; and finally 50 cycles of unrestrained MM using the all-atom AMBER force field. The MM convergence criteria ( energy change per step < 1 X 10 + kcal / mol or gradient ~0.1 kcal / mol ) were usually satisfied well before 1000 cycles were exceeded. The final all-atom model could then be used for another round of FIRM/MD refinement. The MD simulations were done with different combinations of temperature and NOE force constants to determine the best general approach. Starting the simulation at a high value of KNoE gave erratic results and we have opted for slowly "annealing" the structure by starting at low KNoE values and gradually increasing KNoE. MD at 800 K followed by slow cooling gave the best convergence for some starting structures and experimental NOE sets, while others behaved better at a constant temperature of 300 K. Therefore, the results presented in this report are from a compromised MD strategy starting at a temperature of 500 K as outlined below: 1 ps at 300 K with &or = 1 kcal/A*; 5 ps at 500 K with KNoE = 1 kcal/A2; 1 ps at 500 K at each KNoE values of2,5, 10, 15,25,50, 100 kcal/A'; 1 ps with KNoE = 100 kcal/A2 at each temperature of 475,425,375,325,300 K. The final MD model (after a total of 18 ps) was quenched by restrained MM with KNoE = 100 kcal/A' followed by 50 cycles of unrestrained MM with the all-atom force field. The stereo drawings presented in this paper were generated on a Silicon Graphics 4D25/G graphics workstation with the MidasPlus software system from the Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco (27). Random structures of motilin were generated with the modeling program QUANTA (Polygen Corp., Waltham, MA). RMSDs of atomic coordinates were calculated with QUANTA after superposition of the structures.

selected for all the peptide torsional angles and the resulting structures subjected to 100 steps of steepest-descent energy minimization. This was followed by 50 steps of "burst" MD and another 100 steps of steepest-descent energy minimization. All structures with an acceptable energy (about 85% of the initial structures) were retained for calculating an NOE R factor. I&or for 96 random structures averaged about 1.O (see Table 2) and ranged from 0.8 to 1.3. The value of the NOE R factor depended on the definition used for an R factor, the NOE data set used, and the method of scaling the simulated NOES to the was generally greater when the simulated NOES were scaled calculated NOES. RNoE over all NOES than when scaling was done over a region of the molecule that was in an a-helical conformation in the motilin model. The opposite behavior was observed with Rd. This reflects differences in the relative weights assigned to different NOE intensities. RNoE weights all NOES equally, and Rdweights the long-range NOES more hea.vily. Short-range NOES due to geminal protons were excluded from the data sets used in these calculations. Their presence would tend to dominate the scaling for normalization over all NOES. Therefore, it is probably best to exclude geminal protons or scale over some selected set of NOES. The a-helical region consists mostly of mediumrange NOES and may be the best choice for scaling the NOE of a-helical proteins. Helical segments can usually be identified from qualitative inspection of i, i + 3 cross peaks. Figure 1 shows the correlation of RNoEand &with the error in inter-proton distances, Du . A similar correlation was found for RNoEand Rdwith the rrns error of interproton distances. The data in Fig. I were obtained from structures derived during structural refinement of motilin with simulated NOES (see below), structures generated by free and constrained MD simulations, and the random structures described above. The simulated NOES (both sets A and B) were scaled to all cross peaks (open symbols) and to NOES selected from an a-helical region (filled symbols). For structures far from the true structure, RNoE was consistently less when the simulated NOES were

scaled to the a-helix. Again, the opposite behavior was found for Rd.As the structures approached the motilin model, R factors became independent of the scaling method. Long-range NOES are among the most important for NMR structure determination. Since Rdgives more weight to these long-range interactions, Rdmay be a better indicator of structural convergence than RNoE. Further, Rdis approximately linear with Dn and varies over a wider range of structures than RNOE(see Fig. 1). However, since Rd weights the low NOE intensities more heavily, Rd is less statistically meaningful and more sensitive to noise.

Refinementof Motilin
An energy-minimized extended chain of motilin was used as a starting structure for refinement. Two different reduced sets of simulated NOES (sets A and B) were used as experimental NOES, as well as the corresponding sets of NOES in which random noise was superimposed (sets A, and B,). The refinement methodology consisted of the following. (i) The simulated NOES were scaled over the a-helical region to those calculated for the starting structure and merged using FIRM. Back-calculated distances were converted into pseudoatom constraints and used to generate 20 structures by DG. (ii) The best DG structure was used as a starting structure for another cycle of FIRM and DG to generate a new structure. (iii) This DG structure was the starting point for ( flatwell ) restrained MM/MD refinement using pseudoatom constraints derived from the previous FIRM calculation. (iv) The MM/MD structure was the starting point for a final cycle of FIRM; the new back-calculated distances were then used in a final MM/MD refinement starting with the previous MM/MD model. RNoEdecreased from an initial value of 0.90 to 0.36 during structural refinement with NOE data set A (see Table 3 ) . The corresponding mean error of measured interproton distances decreased from a value of 1.3 1 to 0.14, and the mean error of all interatomic distances decreased from 1.13 to 0.10. NOE set B, which consisted only of NOES involving HA, HN, and HB protons, converted to similar R factors. As

expected, noise had a detrimental effect on refinement as judged by NOE R factors. However, the final structural errors DA and DH were not strongly affected by superim:posed noise, indicating that random noise, even at a level corresponding to 50% of the minimum detectable NOE, did not adversely affect convergence. The NOE R factors RNoE and Rdconsistently decreased during refinement, as did the errors in interatomic distances, DA and DH. However, the RMSDs of the backbone coordinates (relative to the motilin model) ranged from about 1.O to 2.0 and had little correlation with the refinement step (see Table 3). For example, the backbone RMSD after the first FIRM/DG was not significantly different from the RMSD of the final structure for NOE data set A. Although the refined structures have calculated NOES that agree much better with the experimental NOES and have much smaller mean errors in interatomic distances, the accuracy of the refined structures shows little improvement after the first FIRM/DG step when judged by a comparison of the atomic coordinates. IFigure 2 shows the refined structures superimposed on the motilin model. The structures derived from the refinement procedure all contained an a-helical region from residues 12 to 20 indistinguishable from that of the motilin model used to derive

the simulated NOE data. The refined structures tended to differ slightly at the Nterminus, where there is a turn in the molecule. Apparently the turn in the N-terminal region of the molecule does not contribute sufficient NOES to unambiguously define the structure in this region. This is demonstrated by a comparison of the backbone RMSDs for residues 9 to 22 with those for all residues 1 to 22 (see Table 4). Structures with RNoE < 0.6 qualitatively resembled the model but differed in longrange folding, To determine what types of values constitute a good NOE R factor,

structures were chosen from an all-atom MD simulation of motilin (no NOE constraints) in which all atoms were weakly constrained to their original coordinates. All structures were virtually identical and oscillated about the equilibrium structure with an aRomic RMS displacement over all atoms of 0.44 A. The range of atomic motions for this simulation was less than would be expected for a protein in solution and well within the error limits of both X-ray and NMR structure determinations (28, 29). Therefore, the R factors for these structures, using simulated NOES from the equilibrium structure as experimental NOES, are representative of "good" R-factor values. During the simulation, Dn averaged 0.08 -t 0.01, RNoE averaged 0.36 f 0.03, and Rd averaged 0.08 f 0.05. Structures with R NoE = 0.39 had the same level of accuracy as structures with RNoE = 0.33. No significant differences in the NOE R factors were observed between NOE data sets A and B or between the two different methods of scaling the simulated NOES. The refined structures from NOE sets A and B (see Table 3) had RNoE values within the range of those obtained from the constrained MD simulation of motilin described above. However, this does not mean that the structures are equally accurate. The backbone RMSDs of the refined structures were about 1.0 A relative to the motilin model (see Table 4) and those from the constrained MD simulation were about 0.25 A. Therefore, the magnitude of R NoE (and Rd) is not a sufficient criterion for judging the accuracy of NMR structural refinement, at least under the usual conditions of sparse data. Re_f;inement of Parvalbumin To test FIRM and the refinement procedure on a large protein, the X-ray coordinates of parvalbumin (30, 31) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (32,33) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and energy minimized with AMBER. The isotropic correlation (tumbling) time was taken to be 5 ns, and a mixing time of 0.25 s was used. The N-site jumping model was used for rotating methyl groups with 7, = 0.1 ns. A simulated NOE data set was constructed consisting of backbone-backbone and backbone-side-chain NOES greater than 0.004 with a random noise of +0.0015 superimposed on the calculated NOES. As done with the simulated motilin data, NOES involving hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, and side-chain amines were excluded. Finally, about 60% of the NOES were randomly deleted, leaving a total of 933 H-H NOES or 679 pseudoatom-based NOES. Structural refinement started with an extended chain of parvalbumin and proceeded as previously described for motilin with the following exceptions. The NOES were scaled over all simulated NOES in the FIRM refinement. Distance geometry calculations consisted of 21 minimization stages, the first 11 with 100 iterations, the next 8 with 150 iterations, and the last 2 with 200 iterations; the scope of the constraints gradually increased during the DG calculations to finally include all 108 residues. Restrained MD was started at a temperature of 800 K instead of 500 K to allow better sampling of conformational space. Models containing all protons were generated at each step and energy minimized for 50 cycles with the standard AMBER all-atom force field (no constraints). One more cycle of FIRM /MD refinement was performed wit11 parvalbumin than was performed with motilin.

The results of the refinement procedure are summarized in Table 5, and Fig. 3 shows the structure at the last refinement step superimposed on the original parvalbumin model. Relatively good agreement with the parvalbumin model was observed over most of the molecule, but a few regions showed significant deviations (e.g., the N-terminal, residues 16-18, 27-28, and 73-76). The structure in these regions may be underdetermined due to a lack of NOES, but this was not apparent from an inspection of the NOES. The last cycle of FIRM /MD resulted in a structure with a lower atomic RMSD but with a worse RNoE (see Table 5 ) . This demonstrates that, without access to all NOES, a better fit to the experimental data does not necessarily mean a more accurate structure determination.

To determine what types of values constitute good RNoE values for parvalbumin, structures were selected from an MD simulation of parvalbumin with all atoms weakly constrained to their equilibrium positions, as previously described for motilin. The RMSDs over all atoms were about 0.78 A, and these structures appeared virtually identical. DH averaged 0.07 f 0.01, RNOEaveraged 0.32 ?I 0.01, and Rdaveraged 0.07 +- 0.0 1, similar to the results found for motilin.
CONCLUSIONS

The value of the NOE R factor depends on the NOE data set and the method chosen for scaling experimental to calculated NOES, but these dependences decrease with convergence of the structure. RNoE random structures ranges from 0.8 to 1.3 with for a mean value of about 1.0. An RNoEvalue less than 0.6 indicates a proper overall conformation, and a value less than about 0.4 indicates a reasonably satisfactory structure. Calculations on structures generated by equilibrated MD simulations indicate that the RNoEvalues of accurate structures may range from 0.31 to 0.39. Although "good" RNoEvalues may depend on the observable NOES in some cases, no such dependence was apparent in this study using different simulated NOE data sets, nor was much difference noted between two different proteins (motilin and parvalbumin). This large range for acceptable RNoEvalues suggests that NOE R factors must be interpreted with caution. As demonstrated with parvalbumin, it is possible for a less accurate structure to give a lower RNoE value. This reflects the sparsity of information inherent in the NOE. Further, the structure in some regions of the molecule may be underdetermined by the NOES. For example, the turn in the N terminus of the motilin model results in a set of "measured" NOES that can be satisfied by several slightly different structures. Therefore, the success of an NMR structure refinement cannot be judged only by R factors. The structural refinements presented here have been based on reduced NOE data sets'with superimposed random noise. Pseudoatoms have been used in place of methylene groups even though FIRM is an all-atom calculation. The results indicate that satisfactory structures can be obtained with pseudoatom-based refinements. More accurate structures may be expected by using stereospecific assignments in the refinement procedure.
