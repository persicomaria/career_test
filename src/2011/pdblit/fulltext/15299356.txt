Abstract
X-ray diffraction intensities for tobacco necrosis virus crystals were collected at 5 A resolution using a Weissenberg camera with a large cassette of radius 430 mm. The synchrotron radiation source at the Photon Factory was used. The crystal structure of the virus was obtained by 91 cycles of the non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. Secondary structures such as c~-helices and/% structures were clearly identified in the electron-density map at 5 A resolution. This virus resembles southern bean mosaic virus both in orientation of coat protein subunits and in their folding. Ordered and disordered parts of each subunit of tobacco necrosis virus are shorter and longer than the corresponding parts of the southern bean mosaic virus by 12 and 27 residues, respectively.

copies of TNV coat protein were determined in a previous X-ray analysis (Tsukihara et al., 1990). Assuming that the coat protein is a sphere, the virus structure was compared with that of southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV), which is known at atomic resolution (AbadZapatero et al., 1981). These two viruses resemble each other in the arrangement of spherical subunits on the icosahedral surface (Tsukihara et al., 1990). Utilizing the structural similarity between the two viruses, we determined the crystal structure of TNV by using the non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging procedure (Bricogne, 1974, 1976).

Intensity data collection
X-ray data collection was carried out on the BL6A2 station at the Photon Factory, using a screenless Weissenberg camera (Sakabe, 1983) with a cylindrical cassette of 430mm radius. The X-ray wavelength was 1.488/~. The diffraction intensities were recorded on a 400 x 200mm imaging plate (Fuji Film Co. Ltd). A crystal measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm was mounted in a capillary in such a way that it could be rotated about the [111] axis. The total oscillation range of 31.625 ° was covered by 31 serial Weissenberg photographs, each with an oscillation angle of 1.125° . Each individual oscillation range overlapped with adjacent ones by 0.125 °. The exposure period of each scan was 90.0s. The temperature in the X-ray experimental hatch was kept at 281 K during the intensity-data collection. The diffraction patterns recorded on the plates were digitized at 100 I.tm intervals using a Fuji BA100 readout system. The intensity data were processed up to 5/~ resolution using the program system WEIS (Higashi, 1989). The mosaic spread of each plate was set to a constant value of 0.1 o. The details of data collection and scaling by the method of Hamilton, Rollett & Sparks (1965) are given in Table 1. The merging R factor was 0.115 for 90 251 reflections with I > 50(/). The number of observed independent reflections and the theoretically possible reflections in each shell are listed in Table 2. The observed reflections with F > 3o(F) amounted to 83% of the theoretical number in the 100-5/~ resolution range,

Introduction
Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) can multiply by itself, and satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) multiplies only in the presence of the TNV (Kassanis & Nixon, 1960). The extract from plants inoculated with a mixture of TNV and STNV gave two discrete light-scattering zones in a sucrose density gradient corresponding to TNV and STNV (Kassanis & Nixon, 1960). This suggests that their coat proteins have high specificity for the recognition of their cognate RNA's. One of the goals of the present study is to elucidate the inter-recognition mechanism between the TNV coat protein and its RNA. Various molecular weights ranging from 22 600 to 33 000 have been reported for coat proteins of the different strains of TNV (Uyemoto & Grogan, 1969; Lesnaw & Reichmann, 1969). We have obtained a molecular weight of 30 000 for the coat protein of the present strain (Fukuyama, Hirota & Tsukihara, 1987). The subunit is composed of 275 amino acids (Saeki et al., unpublished). TNV crystals belong to the cubic space group P4232 with cell dimension a = 338/~. For the unit cell of 3.86 x 107 ~3, containing two virus panicles with a molecular weight of about 6.7 x 106, the Vm value (Matthews, 1968) is 2.9A3Da -1 (Tsukihara, Yokota, Koyama, Fukuyama & Matsubara, 1990).

Orientation and location of coat protein subunits in the icosahedral capsid In the previous study icosahedral particles were uniquely located at the Wyckoff positions a (0,0,0;1/2,1/2,1/2) (International Tables for Crystallography, 1983, Vol. A, pp. 626--628) in the unit cell (Tsukihara et al., 1990). A cross-rotation function between a TNV crystal and a model crystal composed of an icosahedral asymmetric unit of SBMV was calculated using the fastrotation function program written by Crowther (1972). The atomic parameters of SBMV were taken from the Protein Data Bank (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1981; Bernstein et al., 1977). The reflection data from 10 to 12/~, spacing were included and integration was carried out within the region between 5 and 58/k in the calculation. Significant peaks appeared close to peak positions of self-rotation function of TNV. Consequently, TNV is similar to SBMV in molecular orientation of the subunits in the icosahedral capsid. Thus, a poly-alanine model of

A new electron density was generated at each grid point in the region defining the molecule by averaging five electron densities at icosahedral equivalent points. These five electron densities were evaluated by a linear interpolation in a fine-grid cell with grid-point spacings of about 1/6 of the current resolution. Structure factors were calculated by Fourier transformations of the new electron densities in a grid cell with grid-point spacings of about 1/3 of the current resolution. A correlation coefficient,

SBMV placed on each of the Wyckoff positions a was applied for an initial model of TNV for the structure analysis. The position of the icosahedral asymmetric unit of the initial model was refined by an R-factor (R = EIFo - FcI/EFo) search. The center of the virus was fixed at the Wyckoff positions a during the R-factor search. The most probable position of the icosahedral asymmetric unit was obtained as (0.184,-0.245,--0.559 A) from that of the initial TNV model (Fig. 1). The refined TNV model with the R factor of 0.419 was used for further refinement.

Phase extension from 8 to 5 ,~ resolution by NCS averaging
The course of phase refinement by NCS averaging is shown in Fig. 2. An electron-density map was calculated by the FFT program originally written by Ten Eyck (1973). The second and the third steps were performed by Wang's method (Wang, 1985). In the second step, radius R in equation (2) of Wang (1985) was set at 15/~ for 8/~ resolution and 11 A for 5 A resolution. A threshold level of the electron density to define the molecular boundary was chosen so that the number of grid points within the molecular region was half of the total number of grid points. In addition, the molecular region was restricted to a shell whose inner and outer radii were 50 and 170 A, respectively. In the third step, the constant, S, in equation (1) of Wang (1985) was set at 0.30 throughout the iterations, and a constant pC was estimated by equation (1) of Wang (1985). This pC was added to the electron density in the molecular region of the map and any remaining negative density in the region was set to zero to reduce noise. The electron density of the solvent region was fixed to a

where Fo and FMR are observed and calculated structure factors, and an R factor, Ra,, = EIFo - Frvm I/EFo, were calculated to monitor the progress of the refinement. Following Sim (1959, 1960), weighted Fourier coefficients for the electron-density calculation of the next cycle were generated using the calculated and the observed structure factors. These procedures were repeated at the same resolution until the correlation coefficient and the R factor converged to constant values. The step size of each phase extension was kept within 1.5 reciprocal cell dimensions. The criteria used at the final stage of refinement are shown in Fig. 3. After 91 cycles of the iteration the Cav and the R,v were converged to 0.92 and 0.16, respectively. The final electron-density map was constructed with the observed structure factors and the calculated phases in the resolution shell between 100 and 5 A. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of electron densities in the final map. The maximum and minimum electron densities of the map were 6.70 x 1 0 4 and -5.49 × 104 e A -3, respectively, on an arbitrary scale.

Model building

Electron-density cages of the final map of 5/t, resolution were constructed. The total volume of the cages was 10% of that of the unit cell. A poly-glycine model of a C subunit of SBMV was superposed on the electrondensity map on a Silicon Graphics graphics system using T U R B O - F R O D O (Jones, 1978). The residues 179, 180, 210-214, 234 and 235 of TNV C subunit in

the SBMV numbering system were located outside the electron-density cages as shown in Fig. 5. Most of the remaining parts fitted the electron-density map well. 23 residues of an N-terminal arm (flA arm) of the C subunit exhibit ordered structure. It is shorter than that of SBMV by three residues. The corresponding main-chain segments of the subunits A and B were disordered like those in SBMV (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1981). TNV C subunit was rebuilt in the electron-density distribution by deleting residues outside the electron-density cages. The C subunit model except for the flA arm from residues 66 to 88 was superposed well after pseudo-threefold rotation on the electron-density cages corresponding to the A and B subunits. The structures were idealized using a program by Hendrickson & Konnert (1980). The backbone structures around the gaps in the primary structure are superposed well onto the electron-density cages as shown in Fig. 5. The average electron density at

TOBACCO NECROSIS VIRUS as shown in Fig. 8. The ordered/3A ann of subunit C of TNV is shorter than that of SBMV by three residues. The primary structure of the present TNV subunit is not yet known. TNV strain A consisting of the same number of amino-acid residues as that of the present TNV was aligned with that of SBMV (Meulewaeter, Seurinck & Emmelo, 1990). The locations of gaps are consistent with the alignment by tertiary structure comparison and that by primary structural comparison. Out of the 275 residues in each subunit, 89, 89 and 65 residues of A, B and C subunits, respectively, are disordered and situated at the inner part of the virus particle. Consequently, a total of 14 580 disordered residues interact with RNA in the virus particle. Although TNV and SBMV have similar external radii, TNV has 4500 more disordered residues than SBMV. Most residues of His, Arg, Gin and Lys are located inside the virus and can interact with RNA as shown in Fig. 9. Interactions between these amino-acid residues and nucleic acid bases have been found by crystal structure analyses of protein-nucleic acid complexes (Pavletich & Pabo, 1991; Luisi, Xu, Otwinowski, Freedman, Yamamoto & Sigler, 1991; Koepke, Maslowska, Heinemann & Saenger, 1989; Nonaka, Mitsui, Irie & Nakamura, 1991)

atomic positions in the whole molecule is 2.31 tr, and the e.s.d, is 1.27tr. 97% of the backbone atoms have electron densities higher than the average density of the whole cell. The average electron density for each amino-acid residue is shown in Fig. 6. The statistics of electrondensity distributions show that the structural models are consistent with the electron-density distribution.

Concluding remarks
Secondary structures of TNV coat protein and those of SBMV are schematically depicted in Fig. 7. They were named/3A,/3B,/3C, aA,/3D,/3E, aB,/3F, aC,/3G, aD, aE, /3H and/3I along the polypeptide chain, following the nomenclature for SBMV (Hennodson et al., 1982). Each of A and B subunits has 186 ordered residues in the icosahedral surface, and C subunit has 24 additional ordered residues at flA. Tertiary structure comparison between TNV and SBMV subunits shows that TNV subunits have two gaps in a loop region between aC and fiG, five gaps in continuous segments of aD and aE, and two gaps in a loop between /3H and /3I. The gaps between aC and /3G are inside the virus capsid, and the other gaps are on the surface of the virus particle

or amino acid-nucleic acid complexes (Hata, Yoshikawa, Sato & Tamura, 1975; Takenaka, Ohki & Sasada, 1980). The high protein content in the RNA region and the interaction between RNA and amino-acid residues such as His, Arg, Gin and Lys, may be the main reason for the high RNA-recognition ability of TNV coat protein.

Fig. 9. The amino-acid composition of the C subunit, and the number
of each amino-acid residue of a subunit that can interact with interior RNA are shown by open and hatched rods, respectively. Out of 275 amino acids in the subunit, 52% of the amino-acid residues are located inside the virus and can interact with RNA. Amino acids are arranged in the order of the ratio of amino-acid residues interacting with RNA to the respective total number. The ratios for His, Arg, Gin and Lys are higher than 81%.
