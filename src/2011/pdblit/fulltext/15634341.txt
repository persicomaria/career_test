There are several different families of repeat proteins. In each, a distinct structural motif is repeated in tandem to generate an elongated structure. The nonglobular, extended structures that result are particularly well suited to present a large surface area and to function as interaction domains. Many repeat proteins have been demonstrated experimentally to fold and function as independent domains. In tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, the repeat unit is a helix-turn-helix motif. The majority of TPR motifs occur as three to over 12 tandem repeats in different proteins. The majority of TPR structures in the Protein Data Bank are of isolated domains. Here we present the high-resolution structure of NlpI, the first structure of a complete TPR-containing protein. We show that in this instance the TPR motifs do not fold and function as an independent domain, but are fully integrated into the three-dimensional structure of a globular protein. The NlpI structure is also the first TPR structure from a prokaryote. It is of particular interest because it is a membrane-associated protein, and mutations in it alter septation and virulence.

Repeat proteins in general, and tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) in particular, have recently attracted interest from the perspectives of structure, function, folding and design [1­6]. The TPR was first identified during sequence analysis of proteins CDC23 and nuc2+ from yeast [7,8], and has subsequently been found in a wide variety of polypeptides from all genera. It is a degenerate 34-residue motif, which adopts a helix-turn-helix structure. The first helix is usually termed the `A' helix, while the second is referred to as the `B' helix [6]. The most common number of tandem TPRs within a single protein is three, but as many as 16 have been predicted on the basis of sequence analysis [2]. Natural and designed TPRs whose structures have been determined share a common tertiary organization, which is dominated by interactions between A helices and the preceding AB pair (Fig. 1A). Local AB, BA¢ and nonlocal AA¢ helix packing generate an

extended superhelical array with right-handed twist. The motif is often terminated by an additional A, or `capping helix', whose exposed edge is hydrophilic in character, thus promoting favourable interactions with solvents. TPRs are therefore distinct from globular proteins, because they do not possess a single hydrophobic core. Instead, stabilizing interactions are distributed throughout the structure. One significant consequence of TPR superhelicity is the creation of concave (`front-face') and convex (`backface') surfaces. In the best-characterized examples to date, the 3-TPR domains TPR1 and TPR2A of human Hsp organizing protein (HOP), which bind the C-terminal residues of Hsc70 and Hsp90, respectively, ligand recognition occurs at the concave front-face [9,10]. Each of the 3-TPR domains of HOP behave as structurally and functionally independent domains in vitro. In vivo, functioning independently as part of

Crystal structure of NlpI

the full-length HOP, they act to facilitate the assembly of multichaperone regulatory complexes. The structural independence of these TPR domains, and the presence of independent ligand-binding sites in each, has been assumed to be characteristic properties of TPR domains. Methods that identify motifs from amino acid sequence (e.g. pFAM [11]) readily predict TPRs, with the implication that they are discrete domains. TPR domains, or even subsets of TPRs within a domain [12], are often studied independently. In the course of a wider effort toward understanding TPR structure and function, a number of related observations intrigued us. First, the only structures of

natural TPRs in the PDB (13 TPR-containing coordinate sets) consist of nonglobular, extended arrays of helices [9,10,13­21]. Second, the majority of these (11 structures) are for isolated domains, taken from larger parent proteins. Third, of those structures that consist of more than the TPR sequence alone, the nonTPR component can be unstructured, a C-terminal capping helix [14], can bind back as an extended polypeptide to the concave face [16], or can assume a completely independent domain organization [19,20]. Fourth, a single structure has been determined where TPR motifs are seen to fold back on themselves: in the seven-repeat peroxisomal targeting signal receptor PEX5, repeats 6 and 7 pack against repeats 1 and 2 through loop motifs [13]. This is an unusual example, however, because an alternative conformation for PEX5 has been determined in which the structure is extended [18]. This may represent a novel conformational switching mechanism where dynamic, longrange inter-TPR interactions are critical to function. Alternatively, these two conformations could reflect different crystallization conditions. Fifth, no structure of a prokaryotic TPR has yet been determined. Here we describe the first structure of a complete TPRcontaining protein from Escherichia coli. New lipoprotein I (NlpI) is a 32 kDa, 276 residue protein from E. coli K-12 [22]. The corresponding chromosomal gene encodes a 294 amino acid polypeptide, whose N-terminal 18 residues comprise a periplasmic export sequence and `lipobox' motif (Fig. 1B). Following translocation across the inner plasma membrane, the prosequence and lipobox cysteine are recognized, enzymatically modified and proteolytically processed by components of the lipoprotein biosynthetic pathway. This yields an N-acyl-S-sn-1,2-diacylglyceryl-cysteine (residue 19) as the N-terminus of the mature, 276 residue, membrane-anchored protein [22]. The identity of the residue at the +2 position (Ser20) in the mature protein suggests that NlpI is not retained at the inner membrane, but is likely to be anchored at the outer membrane [23­25]. The precise topological location (periplasmic or extracellular face) is not known. NlpI has been proposed to play a role in bacterial septation, or regulation of cell wall degradation during cell division [22]. Disruption of the chromosomal copy of the nlpI gene, or plasmid-mediated overexpression of the protein, both lead to altered cell morphology and to osmotic sensitivity. NlpI is of potential clinical interest, because loss of the nlpI gene affects the synthesis of pili and flagellae, leading to changes in extracellular adhesion properties which are correlated with an invasive, pathogenic phenotype [26].

finds highly conserved homologs from well-known pathogenic species (see below). Initial studies of NlpI primary structure predicted three tandem TPR repeats [22]. A fourth repeat, immediately following the third, and a fifth independent TPR, have also been suggested [27], although the similarity of the fourth repeat to the consensus is weak (Fig. 1C). On the basis of these analyses, one might anticipate the presence of an independent, extended three-repeat. This could account for approximately 40% of the mature sequence, while the structural character of the remaining polypeptide is unknown. Several properties make NlpI an attractive target for structural characterization. The gene can be obtained directly from laboratory strains of E. coli, while its size and periplasmic localization suggest it is likely to be a single domain, capable of independent folding. The single cysteine is responsible for tethering the protein to a plasma membrane; the absence of disulfide bridges or other structural cysteine, simplifies the protein chemistry by removing the need for reducing agents during purification and handling. We therefore cloned and expressed NlpI, and determined the protein structure by X-ray crystallography. The structure reveals a fold in which the TPR is not an independent domain, but is an integral part of a globular protein.

therefore pursued characterization of only the mature polypeptide (20­294). Analytical gel filtration chromatography indicated that mature NlpI runs at nearly twice its anticipated size ( 56 kDa vs. 31 kDa). This was not entirely unexpected, because an extended array of helices occupies a larger hydrodynamic radius than a globular molecule of similar polypeptide length. However, calculation of the Matthews coefficient from initial crystallographic data indicated that a dimer was most compatible with unit-cell dimensions (solvent content  56%). This was further supported by in vivo formaldehyde crosslinking (data not shown) that trapped a species corresponding to dimeric NlpI. Structure of mature NlpI We have solved the crystal structure of mature NlpI ° to 2.0 A. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. A region of the 2Fo-Fc electron density map for residues 158­162 is shown in Fig. 3. The protein crystallised in space group P212121 with two monomers in the asymmetric unit, related by a twofold axis of noncrystallographic symmetry running through the dimer interface. We conclude that the contents of the asymmetric unit represent the biologically active protein. The two chains together form an arrow-shaped structure, wider than it is deep (Fig. 2B,C). N-termini of both molecules share a common point of origin, a feature compatible with membrane localization through N-terminal lipid anchors on both chains. Table 2 shows the secondary structure components, interhelix packing geometries, and the angle of rotation between the AB helix pairs present. With the exception of an extended, but not unstructured region of polypeptide (30­37), NlpI is composed of a-helix (64%) and turn motifs (23%). NlpI monomers can be described generally as a superhelical array of helix-turn-helix motifs, in which the C-terminus is folded (rolled-up) inside the N-terminus (Fig. 2D). A depression on one side of each monomer contains a bound Tris molecule. This cavity, formed by the curvature and packing of helices, is highly suggestive of a ligand binding pocket and we speculate that it may represent the functional site of the protein. Helix packing interactions TPRs Many features of the distribution of side chain contacts within NlpI are typical of a TPR protein. The side chain contact map (Fig. 4A) is dominated by a

Results and Discussion
Cloning and expression of NlpI The gene for NlpI was obtained by direct PCR amplification from E. coli DH10B [28]. The sequence corresponding to the mature polypeptide (residues 20­294, lacking the signal prosequence and Cys20) overexpresses exceptionally well in BL21 (DE3), with yields of  100 mgÆL)1 (Fig. 2A). Purified mature NlpI is soluble to at least 200 mgÆmL)1 in 10 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl. To investigate the anticipated 3-TPR domain of NlpI, we subcloned residues 62­197. This region also expresses well, but in contrast to the mature polypeptide, the majority of protein is found in inclusion bodies (Fig. 2A). Material purified from the lysate soluble fraction precipitated after elution off Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose. Alternative expression, purification, solubilization and refolding regimes were investigated, but we were unable to obtain soluble 3-TPR. This result was surprising, as we had anticipated the 3-repeat to be an independent domain. The insolubility of this region was the first indication that the 3-TPR might be participating in a more complex structure. We

This distribution is more or less continuous, reflecting a progression of helix-turn-helix AB, AA¢, BA¢ interactions through the structure. The exception is helix 1, which interacts exclusively with helix 2 through hydrophobic packing of bulky groups (e.g. Leu44 against Leu77, Met47 against the aliphatic components of side chain Arg68).

TPRs: helices 2 and 3 (TPR1), 4 and 5 (TPR2), 6 and 7 (TPR3) and 12 and 13 (TPR4) contain the characteristic pattern of signature residues that coincides with helix-loop-helix lengths. Interhelix AB and AA¢ W packing angles fall within those typical for TPRs [6]. These repeats correspond to the anticipated tandem 3-TPR, and the isolated fifth TPR predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1C) [22,27]. Helices 2 and 12 (A helices of TPRs 1 and 4, respectively) contain additional helical residues preceding the start of the TPR region. The final helix (14) does not contain the solvating polar groups associated with terminating `capping' helices found in the other TPR structures (e.g. PP5, TPR1 and TPR2A of

(Fig. 4B) is, at 27 residues (17 of which are helix) too short to be termed a TPR. The interhelix AB W packing angle is the highest (+ 172°), bringing them close to parallel, and is also of the opposite sign to that which characterizes a TPR. Interactions with the following pair of helices (12 and 13) is distinguished by the only negative AA¢ angle within the protein. Critically, this combination of nonTPR packing angles imparts lefthanded superhelical character to the region. The pitch of the overall right-handed superhelix is therefore reduced, which brings the C-terminus up toward the N-terminus. Helices 8 and 9 correspond to the region of sequence postulated by some to be a fourth TPR, following on immediately after the tandem 3-repeat (Fig. 1C [27]). However, the interactions taking place within this pair indicate that it is not a TPR. Helix 8 contains the hydrophobic sequence LWLYL(168­171), and these groups are involved in long-range interactions (discussed below). Helix 8 participates more in these than in packing against its partner, helix 9. The signature glycine residue of the A helix is missing, a space occupied in a TPR by a bulky hydrophobic or aromatic ring from the partner B helix (knobs-in-holes complementarity). Instead, the glycine position is occupied by alanine, with the remaining space filled by a tyrosine (Tyr171) from the same (A) helix. The complementarity

between helix 8 and 9 is therefore less marked, and they are less tightly packed together compared to AB pairs before or after (Fig. 4B). The apparent lack of contacts between helices 8 and 9 is, however, compensated for by an unusual association with the next pair of helices, 10 and 11. These pack against 8 and 9 at an angle of 96° (visible in Fig. 2D), which is the highest interrepeat rotation angle within the structure. A unique, nonTPR interaction takes place where the indole ring of Trp200 (helix 10) inserts between helices 8 and 9, against Phe190 and the amide backbone of Phe165. This locks the pairs together (Fig. 4D). The abrupt increase in helical array curvature is the second factor responsible for bringing distal regions of sequence back toward proximal ones. Long-range interactions & globularity The presence of long-range contacts within NlpI is revealed by clusters in the contact map far from the diagonal (Fig. 4A). These interactions take place only between A helices, which dominate the inside of the NlpI helical roll (Fig. 2C). The clusters can be considered as four overlapping groups (Fig. 4E). Cluster 1 involves helices 12 and 14, packing against the N-terminal region of NlpI. These constitute the most distant interactions between elements of primary

structure, and include a hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of Asn263 and the backbone amide of Leu34. The positive AA¢ W angle between helix 12 and helix 10 is in part responsible for this. Cluster 2 consists of loop against loop interactions between TPR1 and TPR2, with helix 14 (including a Ca backbone contact between Gly76 and His266). From functional perspectives this is perhaps significant, as this first TPR is more open than any other, forming an exposed `lip' on the NlpI monomer, and therefore most closely resembles classical TPR front-face environments in providing an interaction surface. Cluster 3 contains solvent inaccessible hydrophobic groups (Leu134, Ile138, Val269) and hydrogen bond interactions (Tyr142-Lys242) between the third and fourth TPR, with helix 14. Cluster 4, which overlaps with clusters 2 and 3, forms the core of NlpI long-range interactions. These include bulky hydrophobic, aromatic and surface solvent exposed groups from helices 6, 8, 12 and 14. For example, Trp169 (helix 8) has hydrophobic contacts with Leu134, Ile138, Tyr142 (helix 6), Phe238 (helix 12) and Val269 (helix 14). Trp169 and Tyr273 (helix 14) are on opposite sides of the protein core, and do not interact directly, but they are bridged by aliphatic and aromatic groups (Ile138, Tyr142, Phe238 and Val269) from helices 6 and 12.

Long-range interactions are a characteristic property of globular protein structures. By virtue of their extended helical organization, TPR and other repeat proteins typically lack this feature, but rather have stabilizing apolar contacts distributed throughout the molecule, both within and between repeats. In contrast, NlpI contains a central hydrophobic core, composed of distant motifs from TPR and nonTPR helices. TPRs are therefore compatible with globular structures, but they do not appear to be capable of defining it. The increased curvature and reduced superhelical pitch required to form a compact, tertiary structure are derived from nonTPR elements within the fold. Quaternary organization NlpI is a homodimer in solution, and the crystal structure reveals monomers to be related by twofold axis of symmetry. The dimer interface consists of the extended N-terminal region, helix 1 and TPR helices 2, 3, 11, 12, 13 and 14 (Table 3, Figs 5 and 6B). The values obtained for interface surface area, interaction

type (two-thirds hydrophobic, but also hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges), gap volume index and planarity (which relate to the complementarity of the interface surfaces) fall within the ranges associated with known homodimeric states [29]. Three aspects are especially noteworthy. First, rotational symmetry places the N-termini of both monomers spatially close to each other. A lipid-modified dimer will therefore be anchored to a plasma membrane in a specific orientation (N-termini `face down' toward the membrane). This is significant, because the potential ligand binding

pendent domain. One could therefore ask if there are any features of the TPR sequences that hint at differences between these TPRs, and those that fold independently. Unfortunately, with the limited sequence­ structure data available at this stage, there are no correlations strong enough to allow us to predict, or subclassify, which TPR sequences will form an extended array and which will adopt globular structures. Implications for function: a putative binding cleft We examined the conservation of NlpI structure through a sequence alignment of the 12 most similar sequences identified through a BLAST search (Fig. 6A). When conserved positions are mapped onto the structure of NlpI, they correlate to three distinct locations within the protein. Two of these are clearly structural in nature: the globular core (discussed previously) and the dimerization interface (also predominantly hydrophobic, Fig. 6B), suggest that NlpI homologs share a common tertiary and quaternary organization. The third conserved region corresponds to the depression on one side of each NlpI monomer (Fig. 6C). The cleft is lined with polar (Asn267), acidic (Asp163, Glu235, Glu231 and Glu270), aromatic (Tyr131, Phe165, Trp198, Phe268) and hydrophobic groups (Ile104, Val269). Visually, the shape of the depression is highly suggestive of a binding site. The presence of four invariant acidic groups (one aspartate and three glutamate) implicates electrostatic interactions, possibly with a basic motif, in the putative binding event. The high degree of sequence conservation in the cleft suggests all homologs of NlpI bind the same ligand. In addition, our attention was drawn to this cavity during the final stages of model building, because it contained a patch of 2Fo-Fc density that could not be accounted for by the polypeptide, water molecules, Mg2+ or Cl­ ions. The structure of Tris, also a component of the crystallization mother liquor, was found to fit the density envelope, making hydrogen bonds with carboxylate groups of Glu235 and Glu270, and with the back bone amide of Val269. Phe165 and Phe268 face each other, flanking the two carboxylates and Tris (Fig. 6D). NlpI is thought to play a role in the regulation of the cell wall and extracellular surface, but its exact function is not known, and no ligand interactions have yet been described. There has been some suggestion that the C-terminus may associate with the periplasmic protease Tsp, and it has been proposed that removal of residues beyond Gly282 serves to activate the protein [27]. However, the C-terminus of NlpI does not contain a motif that resembles the canonical `WVAAA' associated with

cleft (discussed below) of each monomer would then be exposed, and oriented roughly perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. NlpI localized in this manner could then serve as a tether to which other functional components would bind. Second, the dimer interface is made up of distant regions of monomer sequence. That is, N-terminal and C-terminal portions of monomer polypeptide come together, forming the molecular surface. Quaternary structure is therefore dependent on tertiary structure, and their formation may be interdependent (cooperative). Third, it was previously noted that the first TPR (helices 2 and 3) participates in long-range interactions within a monomer through loop residues (Asp73, Ser74, Leu75, Arg78), while the majority of the inner front-face assumes an open `lip' conformation (Fig. 4D). In contrast, seven residues of the outer back-face participate in the dimer interface, packing against C-terminal portions of polypeptide from the partner molecule. Consideration of monomeric NlpI alone gives the impression that these helices make few molecular contacts when in fact they make many, albeit with a separate polypeptide chain. The insolubility of NlpI 3-TPR (fragment 62­197) is therefore understandable, in terms of the failure of an isolated motif to form critical intra- and intermolecular contacts. These observations demonstrate the capacity, and on occasion the necessity, of TPRs to participate at all levels of structure organization, and suggest that the fold is more versatile than was previously thought. We now know the structure of NlpI, and observe that the TPRs in this protein do not form an indeFEBS Journal 272 (2005) 166­179 ª 2004 FEBS

Structural homologs A DALI search for homologous structures finds two PDB entries with significant similarity to NlpI.

interactions. The intracellular ligand, Rac-GTP, is required for the assembly of the multiprotein NADPH oxidase complex, and binds to the surface formed by TPR connecting loops and the C-terminal polypeptide [16]. The ligand-binding mode is therefore distinct from that of TPR1 and TPR2A of HOP. The structural similarity between NlpI and p67phox is illustrated in Fig. 7A, and reveals a close match between the first four AB repeats of each protein.

an alternate arrangement, in which the TPR is inseparably part of the whole structure. Nothing about the sequence, or any a priori considerations, suggested that this structure would be different from the TPRs from independent domains. The structure provides a strong hint at the location of the active site, though as yet the ligand bound by NlpI has not been identified. Its involvement in bacterial virulence, and likely presence of identical interactions in many pathogenic species, makes NlpI a potential target for new antibiotics.

Experimental procedures

Cloning NlpI constructs
DNA encoding NlpI sequences was obtained by PCR amplification from a single colony of E. coli DH10B [28] (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), grown on Luria­Bertani agar overnight. All oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized by the W. M. Keck Core Facility (Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA). Primers to amplify mature NlpI (residues 20­294) were 5¢-aataatccatggggagtaatacttcctggcgta aaagtgaagtcc-3¢ and 5¢-attattggatccctattgctggtccgattctgccag-3¢. 3-TPR NlpI primers (residues 62­197) were 5¢-aataatccatgg gggcacagcttttatatgagcgcggag-3¢ and 5¢-aataatggatcctcactgttc cttatccgatttttcgaagtgc-3¢. PCR products were doubly digested with NcoI and BamHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis onto dialysis membrane, prior to ligation into doubly digested, dephosphorylated expression vector pET11a-HT. This vector was assembled in-house from vectors pProEX-HTa (Invitrogen) and pET11a [32] (Novagen, San Diego, CA, USA), and places cloned sequences under T7 promoter control. Expression in an E. coli DE3 bacterial host produces an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein, cleavable with TEV protease. Ligation products were transformed into electrocompetent E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen), and transformants sequenced by the W. M. Keck Facility.

° rmsd of 4.3 A over 212 residues), consists of eight superhelical peptide repeat (SUPR) motifs that assume a superhelical fold [31]. SUPRs resemble TPRs, but their helices are slightly longer (16­18 residues) and the sequence consensus is more degenerate. The N-terminal region of MalT is responsible for functional dimerization, while the C-terminus is thought to contain a maltotriose binding site, formed by the concave surface of four SUPR repeats. Close structural similarity can be seen between the first three AB repeats of NlpI and MalT (Fig. 7B). However, by the sixth repeat the reduction in NlpI superhelical pitch has folded the protein back onto itself, while MalT continues in a more regular superhelix (and in consequence lacks hydrophobic core interactions). In terms of their biological roles, p67phox and MalT both mediate intermolecular interactions, and are responsible for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. It is therefore interesting to speculate, on the basis of structural identity and the presence of a conserved surface cleft, whether NlpI participates in analogous multiprotein assemblies in E. coli.

Expression and purification
Plasmids, verified by DNA sequencing, were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) Gold (Stratagene), and grown in Luria­Bertani medium supplemented with 100 lgÆmL)1 carbenicillin at 37 °C until cell culture absorbance at 600 nm was 0.5. The temperature was reduced to 25 °C before induction with 100 lm isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 g, 20 min) after 4 h further growth, and stored at )80 °C. Selenomethione (SeMet)-labelled NlpI was expressed in E. coli methionine auxotroph B834 (DE3), grown in M9 medium [33] supplemented with 50 mgÆL)1 l-methionine and 100 mgÆL)1 thiamine. At a cell density of D600 ¼ 0.4, bacteria were harvested and resuspended in fresh M9 supplemented with

Conclusion
We have determined the first structure of a complete TPR-containing globular protein, which is also the first TPR from a prokaryotic organism. The structure reveals an intimate association between the TPR motifs and the rest of the protein, showing how the TPR participates in the overall fold. Until now, many of the TPR-containing regions of proteins have behaved as separate domains: they fold and function completely independently of the rest of the protein. Here we show

Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A [50 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v / v) Triton X-100] plus lysozyme to a final concentration of 0.1 mgÆmL)1, and incubated for 30 min on ice prior to sonication (20 second pulses at maximum power, for a total process time of 3 min, with 20 s cooling between pulses). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (20 min, 26 000 g, 4 °C). Affinity purification was performed with slow rocking at 4 °C overnight, with one-fifth volume of Ni-charged nitrilotriacetic acid agarose slurry (Qiagen). Washing steps were performed at room temperature in a disposable standing column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), with 5 bed volumes buffer A and 5 bed volumes buffer B (50 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). Bound protein was eluted in buffer C (50 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole). Hexahistidine tags were removed by treatment with 10 units of AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) overnight at room temperature, followed by dialysis against buffer D (50 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). TEV protease and uncleaved fusion were removed by gravity flow through a 1 mL bed of fresh Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose. Protein was loaded onto a Superdex S200 16 / 60 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in buffer D. Fractions containing NlpI were pooled, dialysed against buffer E (10 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl) and concentrated with a Centriprep YM10 spin concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Mature NlpI mass was verified by MALDI mass spectrometry. Protein concentration was estimated by SDS / PAGE against BenchMark Protein Ladder (Invitrogen), and by absorbance at 280 nm assuming a calculated emature NlpI ¼ 43 240 m)1Æcm)1 [34].

Final conditions were 50 mgÆmL)1 NlpI mixed 1 : 1 with 100 mm Tris / HCl pH 8.5, 360 mm MgCl2, 27% (v / v) PEG 400, 0.8% (v / v) n-butanol, at 22 °C. SeMet-labelled NlpI crystallized isomorphously, under identical conditions. Rectangular crystals grew over 3 days at 22 °C to 0.3 · 0.5 · 1.0 mm.

Data collection & phasing
Crystals were flash-frozen from mother liquor in a nitrogen gas cryo-stream. In-house data collection used a Mar345 image plate detector (MAR Research), coupled to a Rigaku CuKa rotating anode source. NlpI crystallized in the space° group P212121, with unit-cell dimensions a ¼ 64.35 A, b ¼ ° ° 81.65 A, c ¼ 136.66 A, with two monomers in the asym° metric unit and a Matthews coefficient of 2.82 A3ÆDa)1 (solvent content ¼ 56.36%) [35,36]. A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected from a SeMet­NlpI crystal at beamline X12C, of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data was collected for three wavelengths (Table 1), in two oscillation ranges from / and / +180° to ensure both Friedel-mates were collected for each reflection and to obtain accurate, redundant anomalous data. However, less data was collected for the remote wavelength because of limited beam time. Anomalous data was nevertheless complete for the remote wavelength ° ° (Table 1). Data from 30 A to 2.0 A were indexed and scaled with the hkl2000 software package [37] (Table 1). The search for Se sites was performed with solve [38] at ° 2.5 A, assuming a dimer containing eight Se atoms within the asymmetric unit-cell (including an N-terminal SeMet). Six Se sites were found (N-terminal SeMet was disordered). The initial phases from solve were subjected to solvent flattening and twofold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging. The initial model, containing most of the secondary structure elements, was obtained with resolve [39] at ° ° 2.5 A. However, phase extension to 2.0 A did not work as well as expected. Solvent flattening, NCS averaging with an operator (obtained from the resolve dimer model, and refined with imp [40]), and phase extension, were repeated with dm [41] in 100 steps, using the CCP4 graphical user interface [42,43] and the phases from solve. This resulted in significant improvement in map quality.

Size exclusion chromatography
Analytical sizing runs were performed with a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL Tricorn column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer D. Flow-rate was 0.25 mLÆmin)1 and detection was by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Calibration runs were performed with Gel Filtration Standard mix (Bio-Rad). Purified NlpI was diluted in buffer D to give 100 lL at concentrations between 15 lm and 1.5 mm (0.5 and 50 mgÆmL)1). The apparent molecular mass was estimated from proteins standards, assuming an inverse relationship between retention time and log molecular mass.

Model refinement
Several schemes were tested for refinement. The best results were obtained using cns [44] for rigid body refinement at ° ° 2.0 A, and conjugate gradient minimization at 2.5 A with maximum likelihood target, resulting in R-factors of R / Rfree ¼ 30.0 / 30.9%. The model was then manually improved and completed in o [45]. Thereafter the structure was refined with refmac 5.0 [46] through the ccp4 graphical user interface [42,43], with overall anisotropic B-factor

Crystallization of mature NlpI

° refinement of data and bulk solvent to 2.0 A resolution. The first round of refinement converged to R-factors of R / Rfree ¼ 21.1 / 25.2%. The model was once more inspected and refined further with refmac 5.0. In final rounds of refinement water molecules were added with arp / warp [47], and manual inspection with o. Initially, strict NCS restraints were used, but these were released in the final stages of refinement (`loose' in refmac / CCP4). The final model contained residues 26­284 for chain A, residues 23­284 for chain B, 436 water molecules in asymmetric unit and one bound Tris molecule per monomer, with R-factors R / Rfree ¼ 17.5 / 20.6% and excellent geometry (Table 1).
