ABSTRACT: Gag, the major structural protein of retroviruses such as HIV-1, comprises a series of domains connected by flexible linkers. These domains drive viral assembly by mediating multiple interactions between adjacent Gag molecules and by binding to viral genomic RNA and host cell membranes. Upon viral budding, Gag is processed by the viral protease to liberate distinct domains as separate proteins. The first two regions of Gag are MA, a membrane-binding module, and CA, which is a two-domain protein that makes important Gag-Gag interactions, forms the cone-shaped outer shell of the core (the capsid) in the mature HIV-1 particle, and makes an important interaction with the cellular protein cyclophilin A (CypA). Here, we report crystal structures of the mature CA N-terminal domain (CAN133-278) and a MACAN fusion (Gag1-278) at resolutions/Rfree values of 1.9 Å/25.7% and 2.2 Å/25.8%, respectively. Consistent with earlier studies, a comparison of these structures indicates that processing at the MA-CA junction causes CA to adopt an N-terminal -hairpin conformation that seems to be required for capsid morphology and viral infectivity. In contrast with an NMR study (Tang, C., et al. (2002) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9, 537543), structural overlap reveals only small relative displacements for helix 6, which is located between the -hairpin and the CypA-binding loop. These observations argue against the proposal that CypA binding is coupled with -hairpin formation and support an earlier surface plasmon resonance study (Yoo, S., et al. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 269, 780-795), which concluded that -hairpin formation and CypA-binding are energetically independent events.

Assembly of HIV particles is driven by the Gag polyprotein, which is the major viral structural protein and is present at about 5000 copies per virion (1). Gag is comprised of several distinct regions that are processed by the viral protease as virions bud from the host cell, thereby releasing discrete new proteins required for maturation (2, 3). The N-terminal 132-residue MA domain confers membranebinding activity to Gag, and the MA protein (aka p17) remains associated with the viral membrane after processing. Membrane binding is bipartite, with electrostatic interactions made by positively charged MA side chains and hydrophobic

interactions provided by the insertion of MA's N-terminal myristate moiety into the lipid bilayer (4). Several structures of the MA protein have been determined by NMR (5, 6) and X-ray crystallography (7, 8), and they are in good agreement with each other. Although the unmodified HIV11 MA protein is monomeric in solution (5), crystal structures of HIV-1 (7) and SIV (8) MA reveal a trimeric association that may represent the arrangement upon membrane binding and interaction with the trimeric ENV protein (9, 10). NMR and sedimentation analyses of the myristoylated MA protein support this view by revealing that the Myr group can pack into a surface pocket of the MA structure or extrude and enhance trimerization, particularly of longer MA-CA fragments (6). The 231-residue CA region immediately follows MA in the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. The extended Gag molecules adopt a radial distribution in the spherical immature particle, and the CA layer is located 100 Å from the membrane (11, 12). During the subsequent process of maturation, 1000-1500 CA protein (aka p24) molecules rearrange to form the distinctive conical capsid of infectious virions,

11258 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 38, 2006 which is organized as a fullerene cone (13-15). The CA protein is comprised of two domains (16). The N-terminal domain (CAN133-278; Gag residues 133-278) mediates hexamer formation in the viral capsid, and the C-terminal domain (CAC: Gag residues 279-363) mediates CA dimerization in solution and association of adjacent CA hexamers in the core (14, 17). A detailed model for the CAN hexamer is provided by the crystal structure of the CAN protein of murine leukemia virus (MLV) (18). This structure is consistent with earlier EM reconstructions of the HIV-1 CA hexamer (14) and reveals relatively polar intersubunit interactions mediated by CAN helices 1, 2, and 3. A detailed model of the mature CA CTD dimer is provided by crystal structures (17, 19). A related but domain-swapped dimer model has been proposed for the immature CA CTD by analogy with the structurally related SCAN domain (20). Finally, an additional site of contact between the N- and C-terminal domains is supported by biochemical studies (21) but has not yet been visualized at high resolution. Following Gag proteolysis, the N-terminal residues of CAN133-278 adopt a -hairpin conformation that is stabilized by a salt bridge between Asp183 (Gag numbering is used throughout) and the free cationic CAN N-terminal amine (16). Stabilization of the -hairpin conformation by the free CAN N-terminus means that its formation is favored by Gag processing. -hairpin formation appears to be important for viral maturation and assembly of the conical capsid (22, 23), although its precise role remains unclear. Another important role of CAN is to bind the cellular protein cyclophilin A (CypA) (24). This interaction plays an important role in HIV-1 infectivity, probably because CA-CypA interactions within the target host cell modulate the binding of host restriction factors (25-29). The CypA active sites bind the Gly221-Pro222 dipeptide (30-32), which is located on an inherently flexible 18-residue cyclophilin-binding loop. HIV-1 CA is a substrate for CypAcatalyzed proline isomerization (33), although it is not yet known if the CypA rotamase activity is important for HIV-1 infectivity. CA/CypA complexes in which the Gly221Pro222 peptide adopts either cis or trans conformation have been visualized in a series of crystal structures, which indicate that the cis-trans isomerization activity of CypA proceeds by rotation of residues N-terminal to the bound proline (34). An alternative mechanism of C-terminal rotation has also been proposed (35). In order to extend our understanding of the structural basis for HIV assembly and maturation, we have determined the crystal structures of Gag1-278 (i.e., the fused MA and CAN domains) at 2.2 Å resolution and the free CAN133-278 domain (A224E mutant) at 1.9 Å resolution. A key finding is that the structure of CA remains largely unchanged upon proteolysis at the MA-CA junction, with the exception of -hairpin formation in the CAN133-278 structure. This observation indicates that CypA binding is unlikely to be significantly affected by Gag processing and is consistent with the view that conformational changes that allow the formation of the conical viral core are likely to be centered on the -hairpin and residues near the N-terminus of helix 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS

CAN133-278 Expression and Purification. Native CAN(A224E) protein (CAN133-278) was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) at 23 °C. Protein expression was induced at an optical density (A600) of 0.7 with 1 mM IPTG. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were harvested 4 h post induction by centrifugation, lysed in a French press, and sonicated to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25 900g for 50 min, and the crude CAN133-278 protein was precipitated by the addition of 0.4 equiv of saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution. The pellet was dissolved in a buffer of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, and chromatographed on a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). The protein eluted at 300 mM NaCl using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing the protein were pooled, dialyzed in 25 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid potassium salt (KMOPS) at pH 6.8, 1 M (NH4)2SO4, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, and loaded onto a Phenyl Sepharose column (Pharmacia). CAN133-278 was eluted at 200 mM (NH4)2SO4 using a linear gradient from 1 to 0 M (NH4)2SO4 in 5 mM KMOPS at pH 6.8 and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. Selenomethionine substituted CAN133-278 was expressed in the methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) in M9 minimal media supplemented with amino acids. IPTG and selenomethionine were added at mid log phase (36). This procedure typically yielded 25 mg of pure CAN133-278. CAN133-278 Structure Determination. Crystals were grown at 13 °C in sitting drops containing a 1:1 mixture of protein solution (1.5 mM CAN133-278, 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, and 2 mM -mercaptoethanol) and reservoir solution (0.2 M biammonium citrate and 20% PEG 3350). Crystals were transferred to light mineral oil followed by removal of all extraneous mother liquor before suspension in a rayon loop and plunging into liquid nitrogen. MAD data were collected from a single crystal of selenomethionine-substituted CAN133-278 and were processed with the HKL suite (37). Phases were determined using SOLVE (38). Mapfitting and refinement were performed using O (39) and REFMAC5 (40). Crystallographic statistics are given in Table 1. Gag1-278 Expression and Purification. Gag1-278 was expressed with an N-terminal extension that includes eight histidine residues and can be removed by the TEV protease to yield residues 1-278 of HIV-1NL43 Gag, including the initiator Met1 and preceding non-native glycine and histidine residues. Induction of expression was the same as that for CAN133-278 (above). Cells from 5 L of bacterial culture were resuspended in 45 mL of nickel column lysis buffer (50 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 mM Tris at pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence of 50 mg of lysozyme and 45 µL of 1000× protease inhibitors (pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) (Sigma) and 100 µL of PMSF (Research Biochemicals International). Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. The lysate was sonicated, clarified by centrifugation, and applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). Washing with three column volumes of lysis buffer made to 80 mM imidazole was followed by elution with five column volumes of lysis buffer made to 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing Gag1-278 were dialyzed into TEV cleavage buffer (50 mM

The cleaved protein was further purified on an SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a linear gradient from 50 mM to 1 M NaCl in 25 mM MOPS at pH 6.8 and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. Gag1-278 eluted at approximately 600 mM NaCl. The final purification step was gel filtration chromatography on an SD75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mM Tris at pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. The protein was concentrated to 0.27 mM for crystal growth. The purified protein was confirmed to be full length Gag1-278 by Nterminal sequencing (GHMGARA) and mass spectrometry (observed 31206.6 Da, calculated 31207.6 Da). This procedure typically yielded 8 mg of pure Gag1-278. Selenomethionine substituted Gag1-278 was expressed using BL21(DE3) cells in M9 minimal media (41). Amino acids, including selenomethionine were added at an OD600 value of 0.5. The cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG, and protein expression took place for 12 h at 23 °C. Gag1-278 Structure Determination. Gag1-278 crystals grew within two weeks in hanging drops at 21 °C. The reservoir solution was 28% PEG 8000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.7. The drop was a 1:1 mixture of protein and reservoir solutions. The crystals were transferred for a few seconds to the reservoir solution to which glycerol was added to a final glycerol concentration of 25%, suspended in a rayon loop, and cryocooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Data were processed with the HKL suite (37). SOLVE (42) was used to locate Se positions from the 3.4 Å resolution SAD data. This allowed positioning of one CAN

domain by the matching of Se sites to the positions of Met residues within the known CAN structure. Following rigid body refinement, additional CAN and MA domains were located by molecular replacement using EPMR (43). Refinement calculations were performed by REFMAC5 (40), operated via the CCP4 interface (44). Map fitting was performed using XTALVIEW (45). Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 2. Figures were made with Pymol (46). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Gag1-278 Structure Determination. The HIV-1 Gag1-278 construct encompasses the entire MA and CAN domains. It is identical to the Gag1-283 construct whose NMR structure was reported earlier (47) except that it has two additional residues at the N-terminus and lacks five CA residues and a polyhistidine tag at the C-terminus (all of which were disordered in the NMR structure). The Gag1-278 structure was determined using SAD data collected from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal. A CAN domain was docked on the Se positions, and molecular replacement was used with higher quality native data to locate the other CAN and MA domains. The structure has been refined to an R factor (Rfree) of 0.205 (0.258) against 2.2 Å data and displays good geometry (Table 2). The crystal possesses two Gag1-278 molecules per asymmetric unit, although only one of the two MA domains is visible in electron density maps. The possibility of partial proteolysis during crystallization was discounted by SDS-PAGE visualization of washed crystals, which revealed a single species

that comigrated with full length Gag1-278 (data not shown). We, therefore, conclude that the missing MA domain is present within the crystal but is mobile and adopts a range of orientations. This is consistent with packing of the crystal lattice, which contains large volumes of bulk solvent that could accommodate an MA domain in a variety of locations. Assuming two full-length Gag1-278 molecules per asymmetric unit, the solvent content is estimated to be 56%. Gag1-278 Structure Description. The crystal structure indicates that Gag1-278 comprises ordered MA and CAN domains that are connected by a flexible linker (Figure 1a and b). MA comprises a globular structure of six helices, and CA comprises a helical bundle of four helices (H1, H2, H3, and H7) with H4 packing at an angle that imparts an overall arrowhead shape. The relatively short H5 and H6 helices pack perpendicular to the four helix bundle at the top of the structure. This same arrangement was reported for the structure of Gag1-283 determined in solution (47), and the MA and CAN domains of Gag1-278 superimpose closely with those of the Gag1-283 structure and previously determined structures of the isolated domains. The 101 ordered residues of the Gag1-278 MA domain (Figure 1a) overlap previously determined MA structures (57) with an RMSD on all CR atoms that ranges between 1.0 and 1.9 Å. The largest deviations are in residues 66-74, a region that adjusts in response to MA trimer formation (48). In contrast to previously determined HIV-1 (7) and SIV (8) MA crystal structures, both of which displayed a trimeric association, the MA domain is monomeric in the Gag1-278 crystal. The structure does not suggest a reason why isolated MA protein might trimerize, whereas the MA domain of Gag1-278 would be prevented from forming this arrangement. Consistent with NMR data indicating that myristate exposure

favors trimerization (6), we favor the possibility that the MA protein and the MA domain of Gag trimerize upon binding the membrane. Presumably, the absence of membrane association and myristoylation of Gag1-278 allows the crystal packing forces of some lattices to overcome the inherently weak affinity, whereas other lattices accommodate the trimeric state. The last 25 residues of the Gag1-278 MA domain and the first 10 residues of the CAN domain are disordered and have been omitted from the refined model of Gag1-278. This flexibility for residues 108-143 could easily accommodate the 40 Å gap between the MA and CAN domains that has been inferred for immature virions from electron microscopy (12). Indeed, this disorder makes it unclear as to which of the two CAN domains in the asymmetric unit is attached to the one visible MA domain because the C-terminus of the MA domain is sufficiently close to build a hypothetical connection to either of the CAN domains. This uncertainty does not diminish the interpretation of mechanistic significance because the primary point is that the linker between MA and CAN domains is highly flexible in Gag. This flexibility may be required to form an extended conformation that is accessible by the HIV-1 protease. CAN133-278 Structure Determination. The HIV CAN133-278 protein (Gag residues 133-278 and CA residues 1-146) was expressed in E. coli with the authentic CA N-terminus. The sequence corresponds to wild-type HIV-1NL4-3 CAN, except that Ala224 was replaced by Glu. This substitution was originally identified as a mutation that altered HIV-1's dependence on cyclophilin A (49, 50). We believe that this mutant provides a good model for the wild-type protein for three reasons. (1) It occurs in the middle of an exposed and inherently flexible 18-residue loop. (2) A related mutation

The Gag residue numbering is used throughout the article, including that for the CAN protein. In order to maintain consistency with earlier publications, however, we have numbered secondary structural elements separately for the MA and CAN domains. The site of processing to separate MA and CA proteins by the viral protease is indicated with a vertical line. The -hairpin is not formed in the Gag structure.

(49) identified in the same study does not cause structural perturbation (51). (3) The structure superimposes closely with other available CA structures, including the preservation of the type II turn of residues 224-227. The CAN133-278 structure was determined by the MAD method using selenomethionine-substituted protein. The structure was refined to an R factor (Rfree) of 0.205 (0.257) against 1.9 Å data and displays good geometry (Table 1). There are four CAN molecules in the asymmetric unit. CAN133-278 Structure Description. Previously reported CAN structures that possess an authentic processed N-terminal sequence generally adopt a -hairpin conformation at their N-termini (residues 133-145; Gag numbering). The hairpin conformation is stabilized by a salt bridge between the CA protein N-terminal amine and the side chain of the conserved residue Asp183 (16). This interaction is, therefore, not possible in the unprocessed Gag protein, which lacks the free N-terminal CA amine, and the conformational transition induced upon Gag processing is analogous to the mechanism of serine protease zymogen activation (52). Several observations indicate that the formation of the -hairpin is important for the formation of the cone-shaped core of mature, infectious virions. For example, short extensions on the N-terminus of HIV-1 CA, which would block the formation of the salt bridge between the N-terminus and Asp183, prevented in Vitro assembly of cylindrical assemblies that contain the same CA hexamers as those found in viral cores (14, 15, 22, 23). Conformational assembly switches have also been reported for this region in the Gag proteins of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (53) and Rous sarcoma virus

(54). Furthermore, mutations that blocked hairpin formation (e.g., Asp183 to Ala) resulted in the formation of noninfectious viral particles that lacked conical cores (23, 55, 56). However, although the -hairpin structure clearly helps CA to form mature lattices in Vitro and in ViVo, the structure is apparently not absolutely required as recombinant CA proteins lacking the hairpin residues are capable of forming cylindrical assemblies in Vitro that mimic the mature viral core (23). Notably, just one of the four crystallographically unique molecules in our CAN133-278 structure displays well-defined density for the -hairpin (Figure 1c), whereas the other three lack density for residues preceding His12 (chains A and B) or Gln13 (chain D). The failure to form -hairpin structures is explained by the close approach of neighboring molecules in the crystal, which appears to block hairpin formation and cause the N-terminal 11 or 12 residues to be disordered for these three molecules. Fortuitously, the consequent availability of CAN structures that have authentic N-termini and possess or lack -hairpins provides an opportunity to estimate other conformational changes that might be coupled with hairpin formation. The overlap on CR atoms of all 116 residues after the -hairpin except the flexible CypA-binding loop (i.e., overlap on residues 148-216 and 232-278) gives RMSDs of 0.35-0.47 Å in pairwise overlaps of the three CAN133-278 molecules that lack the -hairpin and RMSDs of 0.40-0.51 Å when these three are compared to the one that possesses the -hairpin (Figure 2a). The largest displacement in these overlaps is for helix H1, which undergoes an apparent relative shift of 0.7 Å in the CAN133-278 molecule

that possesses an N-terminal -hairpin compared to that of the other three molecules. This displacement is evenly spaced over H1 and is not associated with a change in side-chain conformation. The structural consequences of -hairpin formation appear, therefore, to be statistically significant but subtle. The CypA-binding loop is known to be very flexible (16, 31), and this is also evident in the structures reported here. Owing to different lattice contacts, one of the CAN133-278 molecules is ordered in this region, whereas the other three, including the molecule that adopts a -hairpin, show substantial degrees of disorder and lack density for 3-6 residues in the middle of the loop. Comparison of Gag1-278 and CAN133-278 Structures. The two CAN domains in the Gag1-278 crystal asymmetric unit superimpose on each other with an RMSD of 0.57 Å on the same 116 pairs of CR atoms for the comparisons above. They are also in close agreement with the four molecules of the CAN133-278 crystal structure, with RMSD values of 0.570.72 Å in pairwise comparisons of the 116 CR atoms (Figure 2b). This similarity extends to previously reported crystal structures of CAN complexes with CypA (34), which display RMSD values of 0.48 - 0.87 Å in equivalent overlaps (Figure 2c). These comparisons indicate that the CAN structure is essentially unchanged upon Gag processing, N-terminal -hairpin formation, and binding of CypA. Lack of Large Correlated Motion between the CypABinding Loop, Helix6, and -Hairpin Formation. The Gag1-283 NMR structure (47) and our Gag1-278 and CAN133-278 crystal structures are in close overall agreement; the overlap on the 116 pairs of CAN CR atoms gives RMSD values of 1.30-1.35 Å for the top structure in the NMR ensemble compared with our CAN133-278 and Gag1-278 crystal structures (Figure 2d). This is comparable to the agreement seen between the top NMR model and the 19 other members of the ensemble (RMSD 1.14-1.68 Å). Nevertheless, our conclusion that CAN does not undergo significant conformational change upon processing (apart from -hairpin formation) differs from the important conclusion of Tang et al. (47) that -hairpin formation correlates with a 2 Å shift in CAN helix H6 (residues 242-251). This conclusion led to the mechanistically important proposal that H6 communicates conformational information between the -hairpin and CypA-binding loop and that this effect might help

explain the mechanism of CypA in HIV-1 replication (47). Because of the importance of H6 in this analysis, Figure 3 shows unbiased electron density maps that demonstrate that our CAN133-278 and Gag1-278 models are well defined in this region. In order to understand the apparent differences between our observations and the conclusion of Tang et al., we performed some additional overlaps. To avoid masking potentially important shifts in the vicinity of H6, the residues included in subsequent superpositions (150-214 and 257276) are the same as those included before but lack H6 and its flanking residues and also lack two variable residues at the N-terminus, two variable residues at the C-terminus, and H5. As shown in Figure 4, H6 adopts similar conformations in all of the available crystal structures. For example, CAN133-278 and Gag1-278 display an average displacement of H6 CR atoms of 0.9 Å in these overlaps. The impression of little H6 displacement upon Gag processing is reinforced by consideration of two previously reported CA-Fab complexes. One of these structures has an authentic CA Nterminus and -hairpin conformation (57), whereas the other retains an N-terminal affinity tag that prevents hairpin formation and, therefore, causes this construct to serve as a Gag mimic (58, 59). H6 CR atoms show an average displacement of 0.6 Å between these two structures, and when they are compared to CAN133-278 and Gag1-278, the

a Root-mean-square deviation for overlap on residues 150-214 and 257-276 against the CAN133-278 molecule that adopts a -hairpin. The value given is the average overall models, for example, for the three CAN133-278 molecules that do not adopt a -hairpin, a total of seven CAN-CypA structures with a -hairpin and seven without, and for the top three models in each of the NMR ensembles. b Displacement of H6 CR atoms compared to the CAN133-278 molecule that adopts a -hairpin. The value is the average over all H6 residues and all models shown.

average H6 CR displacements are 0.6 and 0.9 Å, respectively. Furthermore, a series of 14 CAN-CypA (34) complex crystal structures are in similar agreement with each other (overall RMSD 0.45 Å; average H6 displacement 0.55 Å) and with CAN133-278 (overall RMSD 0.55 Å; average H6 displacement 0.65 Å). Overall, these comparisons strongly indicate that H6 moves by less than 1.0 Å upon Gag processing, -hairpin formation, and/or CypA binding and that the H6 displacements observed are comparable to the RMSD for pairwise superposition of the ordered regions of the rest of the protein (Figure 4). The earlier conclusion that H6 moves significantly upon processing resulted from a comparison of NMR structures of CAN (16) and Gag1-283 (47). Indeed, superposition of these models confirms a relative displacement of 2.4 Å and also shows that the two NMR structures lie outside the envelope of H6 conformations seen for the various crystal structures (Figure 4a). Although the effects of crystal packing cannot be completely discounted, the large number of different crystal packing arrangements included in this analysis indicates that crystal packing is not influencing the disposition of H6. We, therefore, conclude that the displacement of H6 may not be as large as originally proposed. Close inspection of Figure 4a shows that the crystal structures do

indicate a small shift of H6 in the direction described by Tang et al. upon Gag processing. For example, a comparison of the CAN133-278 that possesses a -hairpin and Gag1-278 indicates an average displacement of 0.91 Å for H6 CR atoms. Similarly, a comparison between the CAN molecules in CypA complexes that either possess or lack a -hairpin (molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit (34)) shows an average displacement of 0.55 Å. The direction of these H6 displacements between CAN crystals structures that lack or possess -hairpins corresponds to the direction seen in the overlap performed by Tang et al. (47), although their magnitudes are smaller. H6 does not appear to be especially mobile in the crystal structures. In Gag1-278 and CAN133-278, H6 B values (CR atoms) are close to the average for all ordered regions in these structures. H6 B values are also close to average for about half of the CAN-CypA complexes (34), and are only slightly elevated, typically 40 Å2 compared to 30 Å2 for other helices, in the remaining CAN-CypA complexes. Thus, H6 appears to be only slightly more mobile than other parts of the structure. This impression is reinforced by comparison of displacements on a per residue basis after global overlap (Figure 4b). Because H6 lies between the N-terminal -hairpin and the CypA-binding loop, Tang et al. proposed that the apparent movement of H6 upon -hairpin formation was correlated with CypA binding (47). Further, Bristow et al. reported ELISA data that indicated that the affinity of CypA for Gag is 1000-fold greater than its affinity for the mature CA protein (60). It was, therefore, suggested that correlation between CypA binding and -hairpin formation might underlie the role of CypA in HIV-1 infectivity (47). The ELISA data conflict, however, with our earlier surface plasmon resonance study that found no significant difference in CypA affinity for CA (Kd ) 15 (5) µM) and MA-CA/Gag1-363 (Kd ) 12 (1) µM) constructs (32). They also conflict with NMR data indicating that CypA binding and catalysis are the same for CA, CAN, and MA-CAN constructs (61). Furthermore, early models indicated that CypA was packaged into the virion and then participated in early steps in viral replication in the new target cell (30, 62, 63), which made potential correlation with -hairpin formation an attractive possibility. Currently, however, the leading model is that CypA binds

CA in the target cell and modulates interactions with host restriction factors (25-29). For these reasons, we conclude that movements in H6 are unlikely to substantially affect CypA interactions in coordination with -hairpin formation. The Gag1-283 NMR data showed doubling of a set of peaks for H6 residues Glu177 and Gly178, which appeared to indicate slow exchange between two local conformations that differ in phi/psi angles for residues 177-179 (47). An inspection of the top 20 structures from this ensemble does not reveal obvious alternative conformations for all these residues, although the peptide bond between residues 176 and 177 is found in two distinctly different orientations that are approximately 180° flipped with respect to each other. In contrast, the various crystal structures only show a single conformation for these residues. Implications for Core Assembly. The question remains as to how the formation of the -hairpin promotes viral maturation and infectivity. A possible role was suggested from the structure of MLV CAN (18). This protein shares negligible sequence identity with HIV-1 CAN, yet adopts a similar tertiary structure (RMSD ) 2.9 Å for overlap of 85 CR atoms). Importantly, the MLV CAN formed a hexameric arrangement in the crystal that appears to mimic the organization within viral cores inferred from electron microscopic analysis of assembled CA proteins in Vitro (13, 14, 64, 65) and in viral cores (15, 66). We have docked our HIV CAN133-278 structure onto the MLV CAN structure to develop a model of the HIV-1 CAN hexamer (Figure 5). This modeling is consistent with earlier conclusions that subunit interactions within the hexamer are mediated by residues of

helices H1, H2, and H3 (18). It was also suggested that the six N-terminal -hairpins might stabilize hexamerization by interacting with each other, although this possibility is not strongly supported by the MLV CAN structure or the corresponding HIV-1 CAN model because hairpins from adjacent subunits do not make extensive direct contacts (18). Another possibility is that formation of the -hairpin might stabilize CAN hexamers indirectly by stabilizing the appropriate conformation of residues such as Pro149, which mediate subunit contacts at the C-terminal end of the -hairpin or the N-terminal end of H1 (18). Another possibility, suggested by the observation that H1 undergoes an 0.7 Å apparent displacement between CAN133-278 and Gag1-278 crystal structures, is that -hairpin formation stabilizes the appropriate arrangement of helices that mediate subunit contacts. Unfortunately, this analysis is limited by the low similarity of sequence and structural detail between MLV and HIV CAN proteins. Overall, our analysis suggests that beyond -hairpin formation, the structural effects of Gag processing are subtle. This is consistent with the inherently weak and cooperative hexamerization of CAN and the consequent amplification that would allow small energy changes to drive the equilibrium. A speculative possibility suggested by the crystal structures is that -hairpin formation might act, in part, to displace an interaction that stabilizes the immature Gag lattice. This model would explain why CA proteins lacking the hairpin residues are capable of forming cylindrical in vitro assemblies that mimic the packing of mature viral capsids (23). As shown in Figure 5c and d, the two CAN domains of the

Structure of HIV-1 Gag1-278 and CAN Gag1-278 asymmetric unit pack with approximate 2-fold symmetry, with the guanidinium of CAN Arg150 binding the neighboring CAN domain in the same place as the N-terminal amine (Pro133) of the mature CAN molecule. A possible importance of this interaction is suggested by the high conservation seen for Arg150, which is highly surface exposed in the monomer. Moreover, because this interaction is incompatible with formation of the -hairpin, the processing of Gag by the viral protease may trigger the structural rearrangements of maturation by a combination of allowing new interactions and displacing interactions that stabilize the immature lattice. Resolution of these models will require further study. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Michael Summers for critical comments on the manuscript.
