Contractility of vascular smooth muscle depends on phosphorylation of myosin light chains, and is modulated by hormonal control of myosin phosphatase activity. Signaling pathways activate kinases such as PKC or Rho-dependent kinases that phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase inhibitor protein called CPI-17. Phosphorylation of CPI-17 at Thr38 enhances its inhibitory potency 1000-fold, creating a molecular on/off switch for regulating contraction. We report the solution NMR structure of the CPI-17 inhibitory domain (residues 35-120), which retains the signature biological properties of the full-length protein. The ®nal ensemble of 20 sets of NMR coordinates overlaid onto their mean structure with Ê r.m.s.d. values of 0.84(Æ0.22) A for the backbone atoms. The protein forms a novel four-helix, V-shaped bundle comprised of a central antiparallel helix pair (B/C helices) ¯anked by two large spiral loops formed by the N and C termini that are held together by another anti-parallel helix pair (A/D helices) stabilized by intercalated aromatic and aliphatic side-chains. Chemical shift perturbations indicated that phosphorylation of Thr38 induces a conformational change involving displacement of helix A, without signi®cant movement of the other three helices. This conformational change seems to ¯ex one arm of the molecule, thereby exposing new surfaces of the helix A and the nearby phosphorylation loop to form speci®c interactions with the catalytic site of the phosphatase. This phosphorylation-dependent conformational change offers new structural insights toward understanding the speci®city of CPI-17 for myosin phosphatase and its function as a molecular switch.

NMR Structure of Myosin Phosphatase Inhibitor

Introduction
Reversible phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues in proteins is a fundamental mechanism for regulating a gamut of biological functions. Transient on/off signaling by phosphorylation is achieved by coordinating the reciprocal activity of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. This involves multiple mechanisms that are only now being discovered, but are surely important for producing precise physiological responses. The catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1C) is extraordinarily conserved between humans, Drosophila and baker's yeast (called GLC7), and this essential gene functions to regulate multiple physiological processes including mitosis, metabolism and muscle contraction.1,2 Various regulatory subunits bind to PP1C in cells to control its localization, substrate speci®city and speci®c activity.3 These regulatory subunits have a common sequence motif, RVxF, that associates with a site on PP1C directly.4 In addition, PP1C, but not the closely related phosphatases PP2A or calcineurin, is the speci®c target of multiple phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor proteins inhibitor-1, inhibitor-2,5 DARPP-326 plus CPI-17 (PKC-potentiated inhibitor of 17 kDa)7 and a related protein recently described as PHI-1.8 These proteins are substrates for kinases that convert them into inhibitors for PP1, thereby coordinating the activity of kinases and PP1 in a reciprocal manner during signaling. Compared to the other PP1 inhibitors, CPI-17 displays uncommon properties: (1) it has a distinctive amino acid sequence unlike the other members of the group and has no RVxF motif for recognition of PP1C; (2) it is the only PP1 inhibitor phosphorylated by PKC-delta,9 the Rho-activated kinases ROCK10 and PKN,11 as well as Zip-like kinase;12 and (3) unlike all the other inhibitors, phospho-CPI-17 inhibits, with equivalent ef®cacy, monomeric PP1C and myosin phosphatase, containing PP1C and the myosin-targeting subunit MYPT1.13 Furthermore, CPI-17 is expressed predominantly in smooth muscles, with highest concentrations in tonic muscles such as arteries compared to phasic muscles such as intestine. Several lines of evidence implicate an important role for CPI-17 in Ca2-sensitization of vascular smooth muscle.14,15 Phosphorylation of CPI-17 on Thr38 increases its inhibitory potency by >103-fold, in effect creating an on/off switch for inhibition of myosin phosphatase.16 Thio-phosphorylated CPI17 that is resistant to dephosphorylation induces contraction when added to skinned smooth muscle at a sub-maximal Ca2 concentration.17 Histamine stimulation causes contraction of intact muscles and a proportional increase in phosphorylation of endogenous CPI-17, monitored by phospho-Thr38speci®c antibodies.

phorylation of Thr38 in CPI-17 are inhibited in parallel by different pharmacological agents.9,18 Relaxation of vascular muscle in response to agents that act via nitric oxide produces coincident dephosphorylation of Thr38 in CPI-17.19 Thus, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CPI-17 seem have an important role in control of vascular smooth muscle contractility, through transient inhibition of myosin phosphatase. No 3D structural information is available for any PP1 inhibitor protein. Mutational analysis used to explore the mechanism of PP1C inhibitor proteins has de®ned regions required for binding.20 ± 23 Recently, we mapped a minimal domain in CPI-17 for potent inhibition of myosin phosphatase, residues 35-120 (Y.H., S. Senba, M.Y., D.L.B. & M.E., unpublished results). To better understand the molecular basis for the phosphorylation-dependent activation and speci®city for myosin phosphatase, we determined the NMR solution structure of CPI-17 and investigated changes due to phosphorylation of Thr38.

Results
Definition of the functional domain of CPI-17 For determination of the structure of CPI-17, we ®rst analyzed the predicted secondary structure using various algorithms available on the internet{. Multiple helices were predicted in the central region of CPI-17 but less ordered structures were indicated in both N and C-terminal regions of the protein. Flexible terminal regions can prove dif®cult to resolve in solution NMR analyses. On the basis of these predictions, we prepared a series of deletion mutants of CPI-17 and tested their inhibitory potency using assays with puri®ed myosin phosphatase and expression in living cells (Y.H., S. Senba, M.Y., D.L.B. & M.E., unpublished results). We discovered that both the protein with 34 residues deleted from the N terminus (residues 35-147) and one with 27 residues deleted from the C terminus (residues 1-120) inhibited myosin phosphatase with IC50 nearly identical with that of the wildtype (ca 10 nM). Further deletion of C-terminal residues substantially increased the IC50 values. We concluded that residues between 35 and 120 were required for potent inhibition of myosin phosphatase. As shown in Figure 1, we prepared this truncated protein and found that it inhibited myosin phosphatase with micromolar potency. After phosphorylation of Thr38 by PKC, the IC50 was reduced to 50 nM (Figure 1). These results show that CPI-17-[35-120] functions as a potent phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor for myosin phosphatase. This protein was used for NMR structure determination.

841 protein. All NMR experiments were carried out under these sample conditions (see Materials and Methods for details). The main-chain and sidechain resonances of CPI-17-[35-120] were assigned from a set of the standard heteronuclear 3D NMR experiments. For the stereospeci®c resonance assignments of the side-chain methyl groups of 12 leucine and ®ve valine residues, we prepared a protein sample containing block-13C-labeled Val and Leu.24 This was found to be more robust than the standard, biosynthetically directed fractional 13 C-labeling method for the unambiguous assignment of the highly congested methyl signal region of the protein. The solution structure was determined from a total of 1121 NMR-derived distance and angle restraints (Table 1). Figure 3(a) shows the backbone (N, Ca, CH ) of 20 low-energy NMRderived structures. The atomic root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation about the mean coordinate to the Ê ®nal 20 structures is 0.84(Æ0.22) A for all backbone atoms. Structure description

97, two turns), and D (105-115, three turns). The orientation of these elements was de®ned by 87 long-range distance constraints, including 45 interhelical NOEs. Overall, the protein is folded almost exactly in half and the two unstructured regions fold side-by-side. Starting from a short loop, the central helices B and C are aligned as an anti-parallel pair. From this helix pair, loops of the protein position the D and A helices side-by-side also in anti-parallel orientation. The pairs of helices cross one another in the shape of the letter V, with N and C termini tucked inside (Figure 3(b)). The structure of CPI-17 shows only minimal similarity to other proteins in the structural database (maximum DALI Z-score  3.4 for a part of an RNA polymerase primary sigma factor fragment, s70).25 Speci®c side-chain interactions were evidenced by NOEs. We observed long-range NOEs for residues in the N-terminal loop preceding helix A; for example, Thr38 to Trp55, Val39 to Leu60, and

Tyr41 to Leu111. The last part of this 35-45 region forms a loop preceding helix A that is close to the C-terminal loop, residues 116-120. Helix A is near helix D in an anti-parallel manner and projects away from helix D. Following helix A is an extended loop region (second loop) that crosses over the N-terminal region (residues 35-40) lying against helix A. Thus, the loops on either end of helix A are folded across one another and against the helix, like crossing one's arms across the chest. The one-turn helix, helix B, is connected to helix C by a short loop (third loop), and these helices are packed in an anti-parallel orientation. Helix C is connected to helix D by another short loop (fourth loop). Finally, helix D extends toward the N-terminal end of helix A, where hydrophobic interactions tether them together, involving Trp55, Phe107 and Leu111 side-chains, as shown in Figure 4. There are a total of only ®ve aromatic residues (Tyr41, Trp55, Tyr64, Phe107, and His119)

in CPI-17-[35-120]. However, many NOE peaks were observed among the 17 residues with aliphatic side-chains, indicating interactions that would stabilize the global fold, as in a classical oildrop model of protein structure. The high a-helical content, simple overall fold and clustering of aliphatic side-chains probably accounts for the stability of CPI-17, which readily refolds into an active conformation after heat-denaturation.16 Coordinates of the three N-terminal residues (3537) preceding the Thr38 phosphorylation site were ill de®ned, because of the paucity of long-range NOEs. This indicates that these residues are not anchored in place relative to the rest of the structure. On the basis of the results of {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments the N-terminal region of the protein was judged to be ¯exible (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2, the weak peaks of Ala35, Lys40, Asp42, and Arg43 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum are indicative of the existence of equilibrium among multiple conformational states for the N-terminal loop preceding helix A. This ¯exibility would be needed to allow Thr38 accessibility to protein kinases for phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-dependent conformational change We prepared phosphorylated CPI-17-[35-120] using a 15N-labeled protein. It was dif®cult to prepare stoichiometric phosphoprotein in the concentrations used for standard NMR measurements, but a more diluted protein was phosphorylated as much as about 90 %, judging from the NMR peak intensities. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra shown in Figure 5(a) revealed information about the conformational changes. The peaks of Thr38, Asp51,

Lys54, and His119 were affected signi®cantly, consistent with local conformation changes around these residues in response to phosphorylation. A model incorporating analysis of the entire 2D 1 H-15N HSQC spectra is shown in Figure 5(b), displaying in red the regions altered by phosphorylation. The N-terminal loop containing Thr38 and helix A were affected most. The remainder of the protein mostly retained the conformation of the unphosphorylated form. The region of the protein most altered in conformation by phosphorylation of Thr38 is spiked with many charged side-chains, as shown in Figure 6, including negatively charged residues such as Asp42, Asp51, Asp57, Glu61, Glu62 and Glu68, and prominent basic residues Lys40, Arg43, Arg44, Arg48 and Arg65. These charges could be engaged in binding to the front face on PP1, allowing for positioning of phosphoThr38 at the active site to produce inhibition.

Discussion
Structure-activity relationship for CPI-17 In this study, we determined the solution NMR structure of CPI-17-[35-120] and found localized conformational changes in response to phosphorylation of Thr38. CPI-17 is composed of helices with one, two, three and more than four turns that fold into a novel four-helix arrangement with no close structural relative. The Thr38 residue of CPI-17 is phosphorylated readily by multiple kinases, such as PKCa and d, ROCK,10 PKN,11 and ZIP-like kinase.12 However, the side-chain of Thr38 shows relatively poor solvent-accessibility in the NMR structure of the unphosphorylated protein. This N-terminal loop was seen in a ``folded-arms''

conformation with the A/B loop along one face of helix A. The loop region containing Thr38 is expected to have ¯exibility, allowing it to interact with the substrate site on kinases, and our NMR data were at least consistent with this idea. It is dif®cult to compare this situation to other kinase substrates because there is only limited information about 3D structures of unphosphorylated sites. The folding of the CPI-17, protein brings the N and C termini into apposition, thus it is also possible that portions of both ends of CPI-17 act as determinants for recognition by kinases. In the full-length CPI17, the N-terminal segment 1-35 may be in a different and more exposed position, but even with the folded-over structure of the CPI-17-[35-120], Thr38 was phosphorylated ef®ciently by PKC. Interestingly, PKC predominantly phosphorylates Ser1/ Ser2 and Thr9 of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC20),26 whereas ROCK and ZIP kinase preferably phosphorylate Thr18 and Ser19.27,28 The sequence around Thr38 of CPI-17 shows some

resemblence to the Thr18 site of MLC20 (57 % similarity in seven residues) but neither Ser1/Ser2 nor Thr9. Phosphorylation-dependent conformational change and inhibitory activity Chemical shift perturbation experiments indicated that phosphorylation of Thr38 induced a conformational change for only a portion of the protein; namely, the loop containing Thr38 (P-loop) and helix A. This view suggests that CPI-17-[35120] might be considered as composed of two parts, i.e. a stable three-helix base (B, C, D) plus a moveable arm (helix A plus P-loop) that shifts relative to the base in response to phosphorylation. This conformational change exposes the P-loop and helix A on the surface of an active form of CPI-17. This proposal focuses attention on this arm as the region most likely to contact speci®c residues on the front face of PP1C in myosin phospha-

NMR Structure of Myosin Phosphatase Inhibitor

845 hydrophobic interaction we highlight in Figure 4 between helix D (residues Phe107 and Leu111) and helix A (residue Trp55) is proposed as important for correct positioning of the inhibitory surface of CPI-17. The interaction between helix B and helix C might be less critical in formation of active form, and indeed deletion of helix C resulted in little change of IC50. The CPI-17-[1-67] mutant, consisting of little more than just the P-loop and the helix A, does not form a potent inhibitor, even though it contains the essential elements. This reinforces the idea that the conformation of the inhibitory arm (P-loop plus helix A) is critical for the recognition of CPI-17 by myosin phosphatase. Target recognition Previously, we showed mixed inhibition of myosin phosphatase by phospho-CPI-17, suggesting a direct interaction of phospho-Thr38 with the active site of myosin phosphatase.13 According to the 3D structure of PP1C, the active site has a basic patch at the bimetallic center, which is located at the junction of a lower hydrophobic groove and upper acidic groove.29 In myosin phosphatase, the active site of PP1C is allosterically modulated by the interaction of MYPT1, altering the enzyme kinetics, in particular the velocity of reaction.30 The structural changes in PP1C caused by binding of MYPT1 are unknown, but we imagine that this is what is recognized speci®cally by phospho-CPI-17. The phosphorylation-induced conformational change seen in the present NMR analysis creates an inhibitor structure that positions phospho-Thr38 at the catalytic center of myosin phosphatase, but at the same time aligns other residues to prevent hydrolysis. This mechanism invokes speci®c recognition of myosin phosphatase from among other cellular PP1 holoenzymes by phospho-CPI-17. The insights gained from structural analysis described here provide directions for further experiments toward understanding the physiological control of smooth muscle contraction.

tase to produce inhibition. According to our recent analysis using a series of truncated CPI-17 proteins, removal of the 103-130 region of CPI-17 led to substantial loss of inhibitory potency. Deletion mutants [1-89] and [1-102], were phosphorylated and inhibited with an IC50 of 140 nM, 22-fold higher compared with wild-type. On the other hand the [1-120] version of CPI-17 was a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor with an IC50 of 10 nM. We conclude that deletion of helix D in the 102-120 region of CPI-17 decreased stability of phosphorylation-induced active conformation of CPI-17. The

Protein assay Phosphorylation of CPI-17-[35-120] was done using the active fragment of PKC delta in advance of the enterokinase cleavage.9 MLCP activity was assayed at 25  C by measuring the initial rate of dephosphorylation of 2 mM phospho-MLC2032 as a substrate. Assays were performed with 0.5 nM MLCP puri®ed from pig aorta16 and phospho- or unphospho-CPI-17-[35-120] at various concentrations in the presence of 50 mM Mops-NaOH (pH 7.2), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, and 0.02 % (v/v) Brij-35. The dephosphorylation reaction was initiated by addition of phospho-MLC20 to the mixture. At 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes, aliquots (10 ml) were taken out and added to a tube containing ca 10 mg of solid urea and 2 ml of 2-mercap-

toethanol to terminate the reaction. The phospho- and dephospho-MLC20 were separated on urea-PAGE32 and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G250 solution. The ratio of the band intensity of phospho/dephosphoMLC20 was determined by use of a densitometer (ATTO). The time-course of dephosphorylation was linear under these conditions and the rate of dephosphorylation was measured with each concentration of recombinant CPI-17 and plotted as relative MLCP activity against the activity without CPI-17 set as 100 %.

Structure calculations Structure calculation was carried out using X-PLOR 3.851.51 The distance constraints were obtained from 15Nedited NOESY, 13C-edited NOESY, and 2D-NOESY spectra. The distances were categorized into three groups Ê according to the intensity; strong (1.8-2.7 A), medium Ê Ê (1.8-3.5 A), and weak (1.8-5.0 A). The angle constraints were obtained from the 3JHNHa values read in the 2DHMQC-J spectrum43 and the program TALOS.52 Hydrogen bond restraints were employed based on the medium-range NOE pattern and the H-2H exchange experiments. Fifty structures were calculated from the randomly generated initial structures, using the distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol. Twenty structures with lower energy were selected, and none of the Ê structures had distance violations greater than 0.3 A or dihedral violations greater than 5  . Finally, an energyminimized average structure was calculated using the Powell minimization protocol. The quality of the ®nal coordinates was examined by using AQUA/procheckNMR.53 Structure Figures were generated using MOLMOL54 or MOLSCRIPT55 and Raster3D.56

Phosphorylation In an NMR tube, the phosphorylation of 0.2 mM 15Nlabeled CPI-17 was achieved by the addition of ten units of PKC, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mg/ml of phosphatidylserine, 1 mM 1,2-diolein, and 1 mM ATPgS. To monitor the reaction, a series of 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 30  C for 24 hours. The reaction was terminated by heating at 80  C for 15 minutes. After centrifugation, the pH of the sample solution was readjusted to 6.8, and the ®nal 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was obtained at 25  C. A portion of the NMR signals for phosphorylated CPI-17 was assigned using 15N-edited TOCSY and NOESY.
